 Wake up . Wake up , dad . Kevin , come in here And eat breakfast for me , all right , buddy ? What time is it ? You 're late . Guess I fell asleep . Dad , can I ride my bike ? Go get some breakfast with your mom And then we 'll figure it out . Okay . Dad said I can ride my bike . - No , you cannot . Get back in here where you 're eating breakfast right now . He did not say you could ride your bike . So , what 's burnt ? What 's what ? - Burnt . It 's not burnt . It 's well-done . Bye , mom . Mm-hm . Kevin get back in ... oh . Hey , Archer . Yeah , listen . So , specimen 22 and 23 , what happened ? Right . No , but what I 'm saying is ... No , I understand . The whole sequence is messed up . We 're gonna have to go back in . I ... it ... it 's just not working right now . Oh , y ... w ... are you gonna eat ? Here , take this in the car with you . Exactly right , all right . - You forgot your coffee . Kevin , get in here . But I 'm looking at the same things you are . Yes , all right . - Exactly . So if you look at 48-C , I really believe it 's a whole new way ... All right , what do ... what do you mean ? Listen , work back , right ? All right , which sequence ? Work backwards from the goal . So if we 're trying to achieve a ... Yeah , no , we need to have you come in . 10 : 00 a. m . Now ? No , I 'll be there . I 'll be there . That 's good . That 's good . All right . Okay . I 'm gonna let you go now , okay ? All right , here we are . Okay . All right , good . You remember any of this ? Hmm ? That 's okay . You hit the windshield at 36 miles per hour , and you 've been in a coma for two weeks . So , truth be told , we 're very lucky to have you here , alive ... breathing , at all . A car crash ? Yeah , you hit a tree . You swerved into a tree . Where 's the doctor ? They said it would take a few weeks to get your full memory back . They said the best thing to do would be just to walk you through it . So I figured we 'd start at the beginning , okay ? Where are we in that ? Nags head , early ' 70s . We used to go there two months out of every year ... Before our father passed away . That happened when we were 12 . Heart attack . He was the picture of health , and he just dropped dead running one morning . I 'm sorry . It 's ... I 'm sorry . It 's like my life never happened . I just don 't understand . My head , it ... it just feels empty . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Here . Uh , we used to eat these when we were children . Our mother fed them to us after we had our wisdom teeth pulled . Is our mother alive ? No . That icecream sandwich is not gonna eat itself . You should take a bite out of it . It 's very good . You want to hear a joke ? Knock , knock . Knock , knock . When I say , " knock , knock " , you reply to me , " who 's there ? " Who 's there ? That 's good . Boo . Boo ? You say , " boo who ? " Boo who ? Don 't cry . It 's just a joke . I understand . I got it . It 's just a joke . I got it . You 've been married nine years , separated for four . Does she know I 'm okay ? I don 't know . Where is she ? I honestly don 't know . You 've been separated since Kevin died . Kevin . You remember Kevin . He was 6 years old , And he died 4 years ago . I remember him . Is there anyone left ? Me . I 'm here . You were lucky . Lucky ? To get pregnant . Jules can 't have children , And Kevin was a fluke . Don 't worry about me . Don 't film me . Film the lighthouse and the ocean . Ah , that 's nice . - Yeah . What ? Stop . Take off your clothes . Take off my clothes ? - Yeah . It 's a public beach . - Let 's go swimming . I 'm not gonna go ... it 's 40 degrees in the water . Yeah , it 's perfect . - It 's not ... Jules , come on . You can 't be serious . - I 'm going . Come on . Stop . - Come on . You stop . It 's 20 degrees out there , Jules . It 's perfect . - You will freeze . It 's so cold . Stop taking your clothes off . You 're not going in the water . Come on ! But I 'm really good at swimming . Once you hit the waves , you 'll ... Okay . Oh , my god , it 's cold ! I 'm not coming in . I 'm not coming in ! Will you marry me ? ! You work in a lab at next corporation . What is that ? It 's a government-contracted lab focused on the study of chromosomes , okay ? What did I do there exactly ? You were one of their leading geneticists . Before Kevin died , you 'd been working 100 hour weeks . It had been a while since you 'd seen your family . Are you all right ? Why didn 't she want to see me ? Because you were driving . Kevin was riding his bike , and you were driving and you hit him . And that 's how it happened . Yeah . Is it okay if I lie down ? And when do results come in ? Mm . I said thursday . Not thursday . We have some real problems here . Tomorrow ? It just doesn 't seem reasonable . I didn 't say it was unreasonable . I said it didn 't seem reasonable . We agreed on thursday , and I 'd like to stick to that if we can , okay ? I don 't care what we agreed to . Okay . Okay . Tomorrow . Make it out to Archer . Thank you . Okay . Bye . I 'll have to step out for a while , William . Stay here . Don 't go outside . I just don 't think you 're ready is all . If you need anything or if anything happens , just pick up the telephone ... and dial these numbers and call me . William , you put this cereal in a bowl with milk , and that 's how you eat cereal . Okay . Cellular degeneration dates this proxy at exactly the same age as the prototype . We grafted the telomerase protein , and used it as an RNA template like you said . Same results every time . Look . Cell division rate is perfect . They 're pretty much exact clones in every physical way . They 've got the same blood pressure , same brain function , same response time , but ... we 've run into some other issues . Massive brain tumors have developed in 7 / 10 of them . 70 % have brain tumors ? And how long do they live ? They 're not gonna make it a month . I hate to do this to you on your first day back , but we have some visitors from upstairs . What do you mean " upstairs " ? They 're down here to talk about what has become a very sensitive issue . What do you mean ? And I need you to cooperate with them . A set of samples from the second round of splicing along with some corelle solution has gone missing ... that and some human eggs . Missing ? How ? - Uh ... Hello ? I 'm coming home . I 'm gonna make it right . I don 't understand . I 'm sorry . I never should 've left you . You sound different . Are you okay ? I 'm done running away . Hello ? They 're just making sure that it was no one from the staff . Answer their questions . But why would they think it 's ... it doesn 't make sense . Wait . Stop . - Gentlemen . William , it 's good to have you back . Morning . - This is Tom . Tom . Tom Langley ... spenning , brag , and penn . I 'm William Blakely . We just need a few answers on this . On what ? - Sorry , what 's the question ? You said you needed a few answers on this . They 're talking to everyone , William . They 're just taking through the staff , trying to make sure that no one ... But dr . Blakely runs our research lab . You 're a company man , right , William ? He 's one of our ... - Excuse me ? Corelle ... it 's a cloning agent , right ? That 's correct . You took last week off . Is that right ? Dr. Archer , I don 't understand what ... Four samples of corelle are missing from specimen 29 . That surprise you , William ? - Does that surprise me ? Hey , how 's that stuff work , anyway ? It , uh , stabilizes an amino acid sequence in the q-45 ... That must be worth millions on the open market if someone were selling . - What are you saying ? What are you trying to say ? - What am i trying to say ? If you 're saying what i think you 're trying to say , there 's a very serious insinu ... it 's a very serious accusation . William , wait . William , no . - Dr. Archer , it 's an accusation . It 's an accusation . - William , no , how long have we known each other ? - It 's an accusation . He 's accusing me . - Please , seven years . William is one of our most trusted ... I signed a 206-C . You under ... You know that next corporation 's secrets are safe with me . William , no . - I 'm sure that they are . What about the other people that you work with ? I 've spent the last seven years of my life working around the clock , and you 're telling me that because of a lapse in a multimillion-dollar security system , that somebody has walked out the front door with proprietary information regarding the first round of telomerase slicing . Do you have any idea the months of work it takes to create 12 ounces of corelle ? Do you even know what it 's capable of ? I don 't know . I don 't care . - Dr. Archer , I don 't understand . William , William . All right , William , thank you . Dr. Archer . - Thank you for coming in . We 're going to go ahead and ... - We 'll see you soon . I 'll ... I 'll be in touch . - Who is that man ? Who is that man ? What is his name ? He , uh ... he is just from ... - What is his name ? Okay . William , what are you doing ? Who are you ? Where 's my family ? Where is my family ? Calm down . - Sit down . Sit in the chair . - O ... okay . Sit down ! Okay . Hands out in front . William , calm down . Watch the g ... watch the gun . Be careful , William . Be careful . Be careful . Quiet . Quiet . Quiet . Quiet . Just tell me the truth . Just tell me the truth . That 's all . - I work in a genetics lab . A research project focused on the ... What does this have to do with me ? ... a controlling agent . - Where is my family ? ! Where is my family ? ! - You don 't have a family . You don 't have a family . My lab , the lab where I work not extending people 's lives , but making them older , faster , then recording and implanting learned behavior ... Facial recognition , image memory , language , like loading up a computer with data . Why ? Because we want to make clones ... Replacements . Proxies . You are a proxy , William . You are my proxy . Get up . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go up the stairs . Go up the stairs . Go up the stairs ! Don 't sit down ! Go up the stairs ! No , this is ridiculous , William . Go up the stairs ! Get up and go up the stairs ! No . - Get up . Stop , stop , stop ! Stop ! William , think through this . What do you think has happened ? Don 't you realize that if they find out what we 've done , it 's over ? William , no . What are you doing ? Stop . Lie back . Lie back . Quiet . Lie back . Okay , okay , okay . Put your feet under the straps . Under the straps . Let 's go . Under . Under . Under . What are you doing ? What are you doing ? Where are you going ? - I am going to find her . To find her . And to find out who I am . No . No ! William ? I saw you from the bus . Are you following me ? Yes . No . I wanted to see you . Well , you see me . You ... you want to ask me to get coffee or something ? Yes . Yes , I do . Or we could get icecream sandwiches . Okay . You 're beautiful . I didn 't know . I saw the photos , but ... You really are . You okay ? Yeah . I have to go , okay ? Okay . Hello ? No , I 'll be there . I 'm fine , yeah . I understand . No , I said ... what I said was it would take a few days . That 's the nature of time off , isn 't it ? Suspicious ? Suspicious ? No , I 'm here , yeah . Mm-Hmm . - All right . Well , there 's actually something I wanted to talk to you about , too . No , I think we should meet in person . Thank you , dr . Archer . Take care of yourself . - Okay . Ah , Baxter , Can you lock up tonight ? - Sure . The men from upstairs are gonna be here pretty early . Okay . - Did you notice anything odd about William tonight ? Why ? Uh , oh , he just , um ... Um , I 'm going to meet with him . This late ? Yeah , it sounded urgent . Is this one from specimen 29 ? Yeah , he 's the last one . Dr. Archer , can I ask you something ? Why is it you still work here at next corp ? You know , I look at this dog , and I think , " Life is the whim of several billion cells to be you for a while . " What 's that from ? Cant ' remember . Baxter , you don 't just quit a job like this . Why ? You just don 't . Okay . Don 't start the car . I just want to take a minute to explain what 's been going on . You mean ... you mean with you ? No , with the samples . All right . William , what 's been going on with the samples ? I know you 've been concerned with the men from upstairs . William . These guys are not joking around , all right ? Internal special security . The entire department ... They can shut it down just like that if they want to . They will not hesitate to put us down . And I 've given you every opportunity . I have defended you . I 've given people my word . I 've backed you at every turn , William , But your behavior is increasingly suspicious . William ... The best move is for you to come clean . You were the only one who was kind to me . All right . I thought to myself , " what a kind man . " Right , William ... - Stop interrupting me . I talk now . And I didn 't understand why you were being so nice to me . And then i realized that it was because next corporation needed William Blakely . They were afraid of William Blakely . Good . Good job . Good , William . We are gonna deal with this . I am your friend . I will help you out . Don 't touch it . Sit back . What do you think you 're gonna do ? I 'm going to leave . - What are ... No one leaves next corporation . - I do . William ? I told you everything you needed to know . Except it 's not your life , It 's my life . You have to understand . I ... I lost a child . I was responsible . My life ended that day , so ... How old am I ? 15 months since inception . You 've been alive for 6 . I didn 't mean to hurt you . I just wanted to fix something . But what if i don 't want to be William Blakely ? You have to . You have to do this . I need you to do this . Jules needs you to do this . Okay . But you have to go . You have to leave . You can 't stay here . You have to go . I 'll leave tomorrow . Okay . Jules . Jules , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know h ... William , not right now , okay ? I mean , what is this ? What do you want ? I just didn 't have any ... I 'd have no one else . You can 't just show up to my bus stop and just expect me to , like , relate to you , right ? The world doesn 't stop just because decide that you don 't want to be a part of it . It 's just not fair . Jules , I 'm not trying to upset you . I just don 't have anyone else to reach out to right now . Well , you are upsetting me , William . Please , all I 'm asking is a minute of your time . What did you just say to me ? L - L-Listen , Jules . Please , wait . No . No , no , no , no . You don 't get to say that to me . All I had was time . You weren 't there . I 'm so ... - No , okay , I get it . I get it . Is this about Kevin ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry . What ? You ... you want to talk about Kevin ? Is this what it 's about ? Do you know what i do ? Do you know what this is ? I carry this around . This is his hair from his first haircut . I think that i deserve him back in some ways . You do deserve that . I believe you do deserve that . No . There is no deserve . There are no moral order to any of this . We don 't get paid back for the pain that we felt . There 's none of that shit . I was willing to go on with you . You caved . You ran away . But I 'm here now . I can 't answer for that , but I am here now . Mm . I promise you . I am here . I just see him when i look at you . But why not make that a good thing ? I can 't . Hello ? Hello , William . William ? Yeah , I 'm here . Next corporation has called three times this morning looking for you . If you 're going to be William Blakely , you need to go to the lab . You need to go to work , William . Hey , William . William , take a walk with me ? Have you seen Archer this morning ? He was a no-Show for the q1 budget report . No , I didn 't see him . Well , when you see him , could you tell him to stop by , please ? Yeah , I 'll tell him . Have you circled up with Baxter yet ? No , I have not seen Baxter . Some interesting news with specimen 29 . Okay . I 'll talk to Baxter about specimen 29 . You okay ? Yeah . Are you ? Yeah , I 'm good . I 'm gonna go . Baxter ? Hey , dr . Blakely . How are the ... The dogs ? This is the last one from specimen 29 . The tumor spread faster than we anticipated . The tumors ? The brain tumors . I don 't know what it is that you do , what you 've got going on in here , but , um , I 'm done playing games . I - I 'm sorry . I don 't ... I don 't know what you 're talking about . A man has a right to his privacy . I get it . I respect it . But as your neighbor , i have a duty To report any suspicious activity , okay ? Look , I think we got off on the wrong foot . I 'm William . I know . We 've met . Lester . I know that what i do here might seem strange , but I think we 're just going a little burb crazy out here . I 'm a geneticist . I work for next corporation . You know , the big building downtown and the slogan , " Building a better tomorrow one cell at a time . " I could ... I could show you what we do . It 's very interesting . I 'll make some coffee . Get out of the cold . Come on . So , you do science and stuff ? Yeah , I do science . Come on in . Two others died last night and one yesterday . They 're dying ? That has a tendency to happen when you have a brain tumor , doctor . Apparently , when you clone a clone , You get all these weird anomalies Like brain tumors , blindness . Blindness ? Yeah , they 've all gone blind in the late stages . Did you say " clone a clone " ? What do you mean ? I should go . Are you doing all right , dr . Blakely ? Whoa . - Yeah , there we are . That 's pretty well-hidden . Well , listen , would you like to see ? Head on down , and I 'll get a piece of gear that makes it work . There 's a light switch right down there at the bottom of the landing . I 'll be right back . Go ahead . You got to see . It 's great . - Sure . Hey , William ? P - Please , William . I ... I think I broke my neck . You 're a curious man , lester . I had a breakthrough yesterday . I ... I used to be afraid of people . I used to run from them . But I realized that might not be the right approach . I was born on the other side of that door in a bathtub . It took him months of trial and error , and he killed the defects and buried them in the backyard under the snow . And then he made me . I was designed to learn fast . Exponential brain growth . I learned things in leaps and bounds . Tried to make a better version of himself ... Let me tell you a joke . ... without the guilt ... Knock , knock . ... but it backfired ... - Knock , knock ? ... because he had made a mirror , And it became a constant reminder Of who he was and what he had done . Don 't cry . It 's just a joke . I don 't understand . Never mind . It 's just a joke . Use this spoon to eat your cereal . He had convinced himself that i was ready ... That I was ready to go it alone , to do it myself . But I knew the real reason was that he was sick of me . He was sick of the sight of me , The sight of himself , every day , everywhere he looked . ... and so , he left me . He abandoned me . He left me with a black book , a survivor 's guide ... Maps and credit cards and histories , Information about his wife , his wife ... How to find her and help her . It took me two weeks to run out of food ... and then I went out into the world . I was starving . and I was arrested 24 hours later in a grocery store . I was terrified . He 'd told me the world was a good place , but that was a lie . The world is a cruel place , and I didn 't belong . They processed me . They categorized me . They classified me . They told me i was delusional , schizophrenic , a danger to myself and others . When they did this , I would go to a place far away , like a recurring dream ... that I would escape to . And I 've been trying to find that place , to go back there , ever since . And I 'm closer now than before . I 'm as close as i 've ever been , okay ? Next corporation found me in three months . They had searched everywhere . They needed me back to continue the work , and I came back here . And I was alone , totally alone . I had nothing , no one . And i decided to follow his lead . And I made a proxy . And that makes me invisible , unaccountable . I 'm going to disappear like he disappeared , and no one will come after me . Before I leave , I 'm going to make sure that he will never forget me again . He 's going to understand what it feels like to hurt the way I hurt . So this is my breakthrough . Taking a human life is easy for me ... because I 'm different . I 'm not even human . I 'm better than that . William , i didn 't do anything to you ! Please , no ! You 're Baxter , right ? I 'm sorry , what ? You 're a company man , right , Baxter ? What ... what ... what do you guys want ? I can count on you to help me out , right ? You talked to Archer last night before he left . What did he tell you ? Hi , Jules . Hi . Hi , Jules , would you like ... Do you have time this afternoon to come here ? It 's amazing to see you . You look amazing . Hi , Jules . Do you have time to come over here and talk about ... Come on in . Coffee ? Water ? You want to see some footage ? We owe that to each other . We owe that to Kevin , Jules . I have shots of every ... And Kevin , i have stuff of Kevin . No , i know . I know . Don 't cry . I don 't like it , either . Don 't cry . You remember that one time we were on the beach together ? If you could just give me a chance . It 's true . It 's true . I agree with you . No , I 'm not laughing at you , and I 'd like to talk to you . I don 't like it , either . I feel ... I feel like we owe it to each other to be better . Pick up . Pick up . Pick up . Pick up . Pick up . Hello ? William ? Hi . Hi . Listen , uh , We can 't do this anymore . We need to finish it . I want a divorce . Hello ? No , I ... I agree . I 'm glad you called . Do you have time today To come over here and talk to me ? And we can just sort of sit and talk about the next steps ? Okay , what 's your address ? " To whom it may concern , Jules Braxton-Blakely " Will be my wife forever and always to eternity . " But since the loss of our only son , Kevin , " Our lives have been utterly empty . " But our love will not end with her death . " Love is stronger than that . " May god have mercy on our souls . William Blakely . " Hello . I just found out what 's going on . I can 't understand why you would do this . Yeah . Tough break . - Listen to me . It 's funny how sometimes things just work out like they 're supposed to . Your friend is on her way over here now , And we 're going to have a nice chat . Goodbye . Come on in . Thank you . Step in here . Reminds me of your old grad-School place . Yeah . - The one on braeburn ? Mm . How long have you been here ? I moved here a while ago . It feels like forever ago . In the middle of nowhere . Yeah , it 's the middle of nowhere . What year was your father born ? My father ? - Answer the question . 1942 . - What 's your wife 's maiden name ? Braxton . You had a brother , an identical twin . He died when you were 4 years old . What was his name ? Dr. Archer was found dead in his car last night with the corelle solution . Dr. Archer ? I have to go now . I know what you are . What the hell is wrong with you ? You , don 't move . I need to see the two of you outside right now . Baxter ! So , then what do you want ? Just tell me . I 'm your friend . You can talk to me . None of this is your fault . How would any of this be my fault ? I shouldn 't have come here . Wait . Jules , wait . Wait . Wait . - No , I feel stupid . This is not a good idea . Before you came , I was watching footage ... Old footage of you and me and Kevin , too . It helped me . It gave me perspective . I think you should watch it with me now . I think it 's important to do that . Come on . About seven months . The fuck have you been doing for four years ? I wanted to disappear . But I realized that I was stuck with myself ... With this body , these memories , and it felt like jail . No . No . Just come here . daddy ! Just admit this is what you want . Let me get you some water or something . Okay . Go on . Not too fast . You rolling ? - Yeah . Mm-hmm . You getting this ? - I got it , babe . Show me what you got . William , what are you doing here ? You lied to me . You want her to hear us ? Huh ? What 'd she think ? You think she loves you ? I promise you ... Stop . - ... the minute she finds out . Stop . - No . No . No . Listen to me . Listen , listen , listen . Stop . Quiet . Everything you are is because of me . Everything you do , everything you think ... everything is because of me . Me , me , me , me , me . I 'm sorry . Can you hear me , Kevin ? Let 's go . We 'll take a ride . Here we go . Here we go . Jules . I thought that you wanted the same thing . I was ... Jules , come on . - That was really silly . God . I 'm in love with you . That 's the only thing I know . That 's the only thing I know is that I am in love with you . Come on . Okay . Okay . I love you . What are you doing ? What the hell is going on ? Who are you ? You made him ? Do you realize what you 've done ? Do you realize the consequences of what you 've done ? ! I am the consequences ! I 'm not your proxy . I 'm his proxy . He made me . Do you understand ? He was gonna hurt her , and I stopped him . Why are you here ? I mean , w-Why did you come back ? Why now ? Because this is the day that Kevin died four years ago . I thought she 'd be better off without me . I thought I 'd be better off without me . And I tried to reach out . I tried to make contact , but I couldn 't . I killed our child . I killed our child . And so , I moved away . I moved into this house ... Alone . And one day , I looked in the mirror , and there was nothing there . I was gone . I was beyond repair . And that 's when the idea hit . I took a different track . I went with what i knew . I thought I could replace myself , make a better version of myself . I - I could make improvements . He could hear better . He could see better . He would be without the guilt . And he could help her . But I did it for her . I did it all for her . Get up . Listen to me very carefully or you 're never gonna see her again . You understand me ? You need to leave here . Take her with you , leave , and never come back ... ever . You understand ? She 's here now ? I 'm gonna burn this place down ... so no one ever knows what you did here . But what about you ? I 'm dying . I 'm dying , so ... So you get a second chance . So the least you can do is promise me ... she will never be alone again . You promise me this . She won 't be alone . Now , we don 't have long before they get here . Who ? The men from the lab ... the men from upstairs . You 're not William Blakely anymore . He is . You understand ? Give me your coat . I want to go back . I want to go back to kill eagle . We can start over . ... like , a rapid form just to get out . Like , they were going that way . Look . What 's this ? I think got it . Oh , wow . That 's good . Let 's go show your dad . Wow . That 's a nice one . It 's been buried . Go show your dad . Oh , wow , what do you got ? I first found this part of it And I kept on digging and I found the whole thing . Mm-hmm . That is amazing . Yeah . A sea creature used to live in there , and the shell was its armor . Yeah , this thing 's really old . It 's prehistoric . 400 million years ago , these things were ... These things were around . And , uh ... Where is it now ? Well , it died . It died , and that 's how we have the shell . But the thing with this is if you throw this back in the water , there 's a chance that somebody else will use it . Use it how ? Well , they use it . Like , they 'll ... Crawl inside it and make it a new home .

THE CATTLE MUTILATION PHENOMENON IS ... I DON 'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR IT . IS THE HORSE STILL ACTING UNUSUAL ? UH , NO . THE HORSE 'S MOODS HAVE STABILIZED .

Cameron : WHERE WE HEADED ? Lisa : HOYT FOUND A DEAD DEER ON THE PROPERTY . SAM WANTS TO CHECK IT OUT . WHAT 'S THE ACREAGE ? ABOUT 1,000 GIVE OR TAKE . Sam : WELL , IT 'S NOT CLEARLY DEFINED . BUT PARTS OF SOUTHERN IDAHO , THE UINTAH BASIN , FOUR CORNERS , ALL THE WAY TO NEVADA AND CALIFORNIA IS CONSIDERED THE PARANORMAL MECCA OF THE UNITED STATES . LOCAL TRIBES WON 'T EVEN SET FOOT ON THIS LAND TO THIS DAY . THERE 'S EVIDENCE FOR THIS ? WE GOT , UH , EVIDENCE GOING BACK TO THE 1800s WITH THE FIRST DOCUMENTED UFO SIGHTINGS . ROSWELL CRASH IN ' 47 . FIRST REPORTED CATTLE MUTILATION IN ' 67 . DUGWAY IS BASICALLY THE NEW AREA 51 . NEVER HEARD OF IT . YOU PASSED IT RIGHT ON THE WAY UP HERE . GROUND ZERO FOR U.S. MILITARY RESEARCH . I MEAN , WE 'RE TALKING EVERYTHING FROM REMOTE VIEWING TO PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE . Hoyt : JUST OVER THE RIDGE HERE .

IF YOU GUYS NEED TO REVIEW ANY FOOTAGE , JUST LET ME KNOW . AND I 'LL SET IT UP RIGHT HERE . I GOT MOTION DETECTORS ACROSS MOST OF THE PROPERTY . SO IF SOMETHING MOVES , WE 'RE GOING TO KNOW ABOUT IT . ALSO I PROGRAMMED MOST OF THE SENSORS TO DETECT ONLY LARGE OBJECTS . I DON 'T WANT THE LOCAL WILDLIFE HAVING US CHASE GHOSTS ALL NIGHT . ALL RIGHT . [ CLEARS THROAT ] AUGUST 2nd . IT 'S MY FIRST OFFICIAL NIGHT HERE AT THE RANCH . [ KNOCKING AT DOOR ] - Lisa : HEY . - HI . ARE YOU IN HERE TALKING TO YOURSELF ? UM , NO .

Matt : WAIT , LISA , WHAT- - Lisa : MATT , DON 'T . RABIES . Ray : YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE , HOYT ? HELL NO . NOTHING LIKE THIS . THERE 'S NO TRAUMA . THE INTERNAL ORGANS ARE FINE . IT WAS DEFINITELY THE TONE THAT MESSED WITH THEIR SONAR . UH-HUH . THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING . [ SLOW COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ] Cameron : I 'M GONNA GET SOME SLEEP . GOOD LUCK WITH THAT . Matt : I 'M GOING TO DOCUMENT IT AS THE TONE . YEAH , ABSOLUTELY . I NEED YOU TO CHECK MORE . Matt : WE 'VE ALREADY CHECKED- - [ PHONE RINGS ] [ RING ] Machine : HELLO . PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE . [ BEEP ] HELLO , MR. MILLER , THIS IS DR. DAVID AT WHITE OAK PSYCHIATRIC . I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT YOUR WIFE 'S PROGRESS OVER THE LAST MONTH . IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A CALL AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE , I 'D APPRECIATE IT . [ CLICK , BEEP ] Matt : OH , MY GOD . SORRY . Lisa : OK . IT 'S OK . - Sam : YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT ? - Matt : YEAH . Sam : GOOD . ' CAUSE I 'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME OUT TO THE PASTURE . WHAT 'S GOING ON ? Ray : MDE NEVER MENTIONED ANYONE ELSE COMING UP TO THE PROPERTY . I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S THEM . HE 'S BEEN SITTING OUT THERE ABOUT 35 , 45 MINUTES . THERE 'S NO PLATES ON IT . Matt : IS THAT THING MILITARY ? Ray : I DON 'T KNOW . IT 'S HARD TO TELL . Lisa : WELL , MAYBE IT 'S SOMEONE WHO GOT LOST . Matt : HE 'S ON THE MOVE . HE 'S TURNING AROUND . SAM , WAIT . HANG ON . I HAVE A QUESTION . WHAT DO YOU THINK , RAY ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT IT 'S NOT RIGHT . NO . IT SURE AIN 'T RIGHT . I 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY OUT THERE LIKE THAT . NO WAY . [ CROSSTALK IN BACKGROUND ] Sam : LOOK , I 'M TEAM LEADER OF THIS THING . Hoyt : IF YOU ARE THE TEAM LEADER , THEN YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW- - LOOK , HOYT , I DON 'T KNOW EVERY VEHICLE THAT 'S GOING TO COME ON TO THE RANCH . Ray : HEY , CALM DOWN . LISTEN , FIGURE IT OUT . OK , SO I RAN AN ANALYSIS ON THAT TONE FROM LAST NIGHT . TURNS OUT THERE WERE ACTUALLY TWO SOUNDS ON THAT TAPE . THERE WAS THAT HIGH-PITCHED NOISE THAT WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW , THE ONE THAT WOKE US UP . BUT BELOW THAT I FOUND TRACES OF INFRASOUND . Lisa : INFRASOUND ? YEAH , IT 'S A FREQUENCY BELOW THE AUDIBLE RANGE OF THE HUMAN EAR . SO WHAT COULD CAUSE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ? I MEAN , INFRASOUND CAN OCCUR NATURALLY OR IT CAN BE MANMADE . YOU KNOW , AT CERTAIN CYCLES PER SECOND , THE MILITARY HAS ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY TESTED INFRASOUND TO CAUSE THINGS LIKE VERTIGO , DEPRESSION , FEAR , ANXIETY , PHYSICAL LESIONS , THROAT PRESSURE , ALL SORTS OF AWFUL SIDE EFFECTS . AND , I MEAN , THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES THAT WE KNOW ABOUT . OK . AND HOW ABOUT NATURALLY ? ALL THE BIG NATURAL DISASTERS THAT WE KNOW OF- - VOLCANOES , EARTHQUAKES , AVALANCHES . IT 'S WHY ANIMALS ARE ABLE TO DETECT EARTHQUAKES BEFORE PEOPLE DO . THEY PICK UP THE VIBRATIONS . ANIMALS--WHALES- - THEY USE INAUDIBLE SOUNDS TO PARALYZE AND CATCH CERTAIN PREY , LIKE , YOU KNOW , FISH . I 'M JUST SAYING THAT THE SOUND WE HEARD THAT MATT 'S TALKING ABOUT COULD 'VE BEEN CAUSED BY A LIVE ANIMAL . WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE . Ray : HOW THE FUCK WOULD A WHALE GET UP HERE ? SO WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT HERE ? OH , IT 'S REALLY WELL DOCUMENTED THAT ATTEMPTING TO COMMUNICATE WITH PARANORMAL ENERGIES DIRECTLY REALLY INCREASES LIKELIHOOD OF CONTACT . FOLLOW ME . AFTER YOU . SAM HAS ASKED ME TO COME AND DO A BLESSING ON THE PROPERTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ENERGY THAT SPEAKS FROM THIS EARTH . BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW . THIS LAND IS FORSAKEN BY MY PEOPLE . AND IT 'S ONLY TO TRY AND BRING YOU SOME PROTECTION THAT I 'VE AGREED TO COME . THERE ARE LEGENDS OF WARRIORS HUNTING IN THIS VALLEY , RETURNING TO THEIR TRIBE DISTURBED AND CHANGED . STORIES OF WHOLE TRIBES DISAPPEARING . THERE IS A DARKNESS IN THIS SOIL . I WOULD NOT FEEL RIGHT IF I DIDN 'T SUGGEST THAT YOU LEAVE NOW OR TO SAY THAT THIS PLACE HAS NOTHING FOR YOU BUT SUFFERING . I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU 'VE CHOSEN TO STAY . AND I 'LL DO WHAT I CAN TO BRING SOME LIGHT HERE , NO MATTER HOW SMALL . I ASK FOR SILENCE NOW WHILE I REACH OUT TO MY ANCESTORS . [ SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE ] [ SINGS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ] AHH . AHH . ARE YOU OK ? CAN YOU BREATHE ? SAM . THERE 'S NOTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU . YOU NEED TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE . UH , 1 : 00 A.M. ON THE 4TH . UM , ALREADY LOW ON SLEEP AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE OTHER NIGHT . SAM SEEMS TO THINK WE 'RE CLOSE TO GETTING SOMETHING CONCRETE , SOME--SOME KIND OF EVIDENCE . I ADMIT THE SOUND , THE DEAD BATS- - STRANGE , CERTAINLY . PARANORMAL ? I 'M NOT SO SURE . [ KNOCKING AT DOOR ] HANG ON . SO WHAT 'S UP ? RAY 'S GOT SOMETHING . COME ON . SO WHAT DO WE GOT ? JUST A SECOND AGO , SOMETHING VERY LARGE SET OFF ONE OF THE SENSORS IN THE BLIND SPOT . ZONE THREE , SPECIFICALLY . SO WE 'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN A DEER . TRY THE SIZE OF A GOD DAMN HELICOPTER . Sam : ALL RIGHT . CAMERON , CHECK THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD . THE REST OF YOU GUYS , COME WITH ME . [ THUNDER ] [ THUNDER ] Cameron : OVER HERE ! THIS IS NOT A NATURAL DEATH . WHAT ABOUT AN ANIMAL ATTACK ? OH , NO . THERE ARE NO BITE MARKS , NO CLAW MARKS . THESE INCISIONS , THEY 'RE PERFECT . SORRY , GIRL . NO BLOOD . IT 'S ALMOST SURGICAL . SHIT . ALL RIGHT , I WANT TO BAG THE WHOLE THING . MATT , GET THE BAG . [ HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL IN DISTANCE ] WHAT IS IT ? COME ON , SAM , IF YOU 'RE GOING TO DO IT , DO IT QUICK . [ WIND CHIMES CLINKING ] [ WHISPERING ] HI , LISA . HEY , SAM . HEY , BRITAIN . Britain : HEY . BLOOD ? OH , YEAH . I HAD A NOSEBLEED LAST NIGHT . YOU PRONE TO NOSE BLEEDS ? UH , NO . AND I 'VE HAD A COUPLE SINCE I 'VE BEEN HERE . I 'M THINKING IT 'S JUST THE ELEVATION OR ... Sam : MAYBE . [ SETS PLATE DOWN ] COME ON , BRITAIN . Ray : AND YOU KNEW TO CHECK THE TAPE BECAUSE SHE HAD A FEW BLOODY NOSES ? Sam : JUST A HUNCH . I DON 'T THINK WE CAN TELL HIM . TELL HIM WHAT ? HOW WOULD YOU EVEN EXPLAIN THIS ? YOU DON 'T . YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING EVEN CRAZIER ? THIS IS A TAPE FROM THE 9TH . AUGUST 8TH . Cameron : OH , MY GOD . Ray : AUGUST 7TH . 11 : 11 EVERY NIGHT . Sam : RAY , WHAT TIME IS IT ? IT 'S 11 : 09 . Sam : WHAT TIME IS IT , MATT ? Matt : IT 'S ALMOST 10 AFTER . RAY , CHECK THE CAMERA . Lisa : YOU GUYS , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? Matt : WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING ? SAM , WHAT 'S GOING ON ? MATT , I NEED YOU TO GIVE ME AN EXACT COUNT UP TO 11 : 11 . - Sam : YOU UNDERSTAND ? - Ray : ALL RIGHT , CAMERA 'S GOOD . - Lisa : WHY ? - Ray : CAMERA 'S GOOD . - WHERE ARE WE AT RIGHT NOW ? - YOU 'RE AT A MINUTE RIGHT NOW . - WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING ? - CAN YOU COME OUTSIDE FOR JUST A SECOND ? SURE . SURE . YEAH . WAIT A MINUTE . WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING ? WAIT A SECOND ! THIS IS MY HOUSE . WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING ? ALL RIGHT , LOOK , THE LAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS AT EXACTLY 11 : 11 , ENERGY HAS MOVED THROUGH THE HOUSE . Matt : SAM , YOU 'RE AT 45 SECONDS . - Hoyt : AN ENERGY IN THIS HOUSE ? - Sam : YEAH . WHAT DO YOU MEAN " AN ENERGY " ? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? [ PUMPS SHOTGUN ] - NO , WE DON 'T NEED- - - YOU DON 'T NEED THE GUN ! [ CROSSTALK ] WHERE WE AT ? 30 SECONDS ? ALL RIGHT , NO MATTER WHAT YOU SEE , NO MATTER WHAT YOU GUYS SEE , THE CAMERA GOES FIRST . Hoyt : I 'M PUTTING IT DOWN . OKAY . Matt : OK , WE 'RE AT 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 11 : 11 . NOTHING . [ GHOSTLY WHOOSH ] CODY ! CODY ! CODY ! CODY ! HEY , CODY ! CODY ! CODY , BUDDY , IT 'S DADDY . Cameron : SAM , GET BACK . CODY ! CODY . CODY ! CODY ? MATT , LISA . GET IN HERE . WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ? MATT , YOU GO GET HER KIT . WE NEED TO CAST ALL THESE PRINTS . LOOK AT ALL THESE TRACKS . WHERE DID THEY COME FROM ? THESE ARE DEFINITELY CANINE PRINTS . BUT THEY 'RE ENORMOUS . ANYTHING ? NOTHING YET . HOW 'S HOYT ? Cameron : FOR BETTER OR WORSE , HE 'S GOT A LOT OF ALCOHOL IN HIM NOW . BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HE 'S CALMED DOWN . YOU GUYS , I GOT SOMETHING . UNH . IT SAYS " FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY . " Ray : WHAT THE HELL IS THAT , SAM ? MAKE A CALL RIGHT NOW . SAM ! NO ONE 'S PICKING UP . DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER NUMBER FOR THEM ? NO . - SAM , SOMEONE 'S- - - WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO , LISA ? - I 'M JUST SAYING- - - [ PHONE RINGS ] YEAH . I DID CALL , YES . WELL , WHAT WE HAVE- - YOU 'RE SAYING THEY WERE HERE ? - FROM ' 67 TO ' 71 . - DOING WHAT ? LOOK , YOU GUYS ARE LOOKING AT THIS THE WRONG WAY , OK ? THEY ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS . THEY OFFERED TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION . THEY 'RE NOT TRYING TO HIDE ANYTHING . THEY DID ? THEY ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION--YOUR QUESTIONS ? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ? THEY ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS , HOYT . MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS , THEY DID ? THEY DIDN 'T FIND ANYTHING , OK ? I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND . THEY WERE HERE . THEY WERE HERE . - Matt : WAIT . WAIT . - Hoyt : JUST LISTEN TO ME ONE SECOND ! - Hoyt : LISTEN TO ME ! - Cameron : MATT ! THEY WERE HERE ? YOU 'RE TELLING ME THEY WERE HERE . THEY WERE HERE BEFORE MY BOY WAS TAKEN . Matt : ... BETTER SCIENCE . Hoyt : YOU 'RE JUST TALKING . YOU 'RE JUST TALKING . YOU 'RE NOT SAYING ANYTHING . YOU JUST SAY , " BLAH , BLAH , BLAH . " THAT 'S THE WAY YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE . YOU JUST TALK . I 'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING REAL HERE . I 'M TALKING ABOUT MY BOY . LOOK , WE HAD NO IDEA UNTIL I JUST HAD THAT PHONE CALL . BUT THEM BEING HERE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR BOY . YOU UNDERSTAND , HOYT ? WHY ? WHY DOES IT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BOY ? TELL ME . DO--DO YOU HAVE AN ANSWER ? EXCUSE ME . Matt : LISA , YOU ARE A SCIENTIST . WHAT ARE YOU INVESTIGATING ? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND ? ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND MY BOY ? ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND MY SON ? JUST LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME THAT YOU 'RE TRYING TO FIND MY SON . ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND MY SON ? - I 'M TRYING TO HELP YOU . - HOW YOU TRYING TO HELP ME ? YOU 'RE TRYING TO HELP YOURSELF . I 'M ON TO YOU . YOU 'D BETTER WATCH OUT . YOU 'D BETTER WATCH YOURSELF . PUT IT DOWN . THIS IS WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT . GUYS , I FOUND TWO MORE CONTAINERS BURIED IN THE SHED . NOW , ONE WAS EMPTY LIKE THE FIRST ONE I FOUND . BUT THE SECOND HAD THIS IN IT . - WHAT IS THIS ? - IT 'S A U-MATIC TAPE . MOSTLY USED IN THE LATE ' 60S AND EARLY ' 70S . AND , SAM , THAT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE TIMEFRAME THAT MDE SAID THEY WERE ORIGINALLY ON THE PROPERTY . I 'M NOT SURE OFFHAND IF WE HAVE ANYTHING ON SITE I CAN CHECK THIS WITH . I 'LL SEE WHAT I CAN PUT TOGETHER , ALL RIGHT ? [ EXHALES ] LATE NIGHT . AUGUST 12TH . APPARENTLY MDE WAS OUT HERE IN THE ' 60S LOOKING INTO THIS THING . THE BOX WE FOUND IN THE SHED SAID " FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY . " AND IT WAS EMPTY . I WOULD , UH , PROBABLY BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF I HADN 'T SEEN WHAT LOOKED LIKE HOYT 'S SON TEAR THROUGH THE HOUSE , GO INTO A SHED , AND COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR . HE WAS GONE . I ... I CAN 'T EXPLAIN IT . I FEEL LIKE SAM IS SO OBSESSED WITH FINDING EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT 'S HAPPENING HERE THAT HE WON 'T EVEN QUESTION MDE 'S MOTIVES . - [ ROAR ] - AAH ! Cameron : SO , LISA , YOU 'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS ? Lisa : NO . THAT 'S IT , THEN . LET 'S GO HUNTING . Sam : THERE SHOULD BE TRACKS , RIGHT ? Lisa : I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE TRACKS WE FOUND IN THE SHED . IT HAS TO BE THE SAME ANIMAL . AND JUST JUDGING BY THE SIZE OF THE WOLF WE SAW , I 'D SAY IT WAS EASILY 500 POUNDS , WHICH IS FIVE TIMES LARGER- - Matt : GUYS ! THAT THING IS HUGE . [ SHOTGUN PUMPS ] [ GROWLING ] COME ON , LET 'S GO GET IT . COME ON , THAT 'S WHAT WE 'RE HERE FOR . GO ! [ ENGINE STARTS ] Hoyt : WE GOT TO GO THE REST OF THE WAY ON FOOT , HE 'S RIGHT OUT THERE .

Matt : WAIT , SAM , DID YOU SEE THE LIGHT ? - Lisa : WHAT IS IT ? - Matt : THERE WAS A LIGHT . Matt : I BET IT 'S A CAVE SYSTEM . I GOT SOME ROPES IN MY TRUCK . LET ME GO GET ' EM . - Matt : ALL RIGHT . - Hoyt : YOU GUYS BE CAREFUL . THAT THING 'S STILL OUT HERE SOMEWHERE . SAM , YOU 'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE THIS . Cameron : HOW OLD DO YOU THINK THAT IS ? JESUS , SAM , WHAT 'S GOING ON REALLY ? Hoyt : WHAT THE HELL WE EVEN LOOKING AT ? RAY , LOOK AT THIS ! LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND OUR ARTIST . SHH . SHH . HOW THE HELL WOULD THAT THING EVEN GET DOWN HERE ?

AUGUST 13TH . WE JUST ... [ GARBLED ] ... THE WOLF , I DON 'T KNOW ... [ GARBLED ] COULD BE A VIMANA , RIGHT ? Ray : A WHAT ? A VIMANA . HUH ? IN INDIA , THEY 'VE UNCOVERED ALL THESE ANCIENT TEXTS AND DOCUMENTS THAT DESCRIBE A FLYING SPACECRAFT CALLED A VIMANA . AND I MEAN , IT LOOKS- - IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THIS . EVEN THOUGH THAT STUFF IS , LIKE , 6,000 YEARS OLD AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT 'S MYTH , EXPERTS IN OUR FIELD THINK THAT , YOU KNOW , BASED ON THE SCHEMATICS AND THE FLIGHT PLANS AND THE DESIGN THAT IT 'S AS MODERN AS ANYTHING YOU 'D SEE TODAY . ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT OUR NATIVE PAINTED A SPACECRAFT ON THE INSIDE OF THIS CAVE ? YEAH . JUST , I KNOW EVERYTHING WE 'VE SEEN . THAT JUST SEEMS PRETTY ASTOUNDING . - WELL , IT 'S , LIKE , A PERFECT MATCH . - AND THE WOLF ? THIS IS BIGGER THAN A WOLF OR MISSING KID . HOW DO YOU EVEN KNOW HE 'S BACK HERE ? HE 'S WORKING ON THE ATV . JUST WANTED TO SAY I COMPLETELY LOST MY PERSPECTIVE BACK THERE . AND , UH ... I 'M REALLY SORRY . STUFF LIKE THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES , YOU KNOW . YOU KNOW , UH ...

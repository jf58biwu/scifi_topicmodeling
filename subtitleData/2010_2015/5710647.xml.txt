We had some questions regarding her . She never listened to anyone . It was always something or the other . Hold her not to go . There was nothing wrong with this place . She went out to study " ... but , started working in a club instead . At first I thought , it 's a good thing . At least she 's sending some money . Later , she stopped sending money as well . She must have eloped with someone . You must be earning well . Look at this hand . I used to feed her with it . And she left it . Did Chaima have any siblings ? He has a brother . He got married 4 years ago . But , his wife took him to Hong Kong . Forgot all about his mother . Everyone has their own life . I wish them well , wherever they are . Do you miss her ? Get out ! Let 's go . Listen . I helped your NGO , won ' ! you help me ? What did you say the club 's name was ? It 's in Nandi ... Some Ice Bar . Ice Bar ? - Ice Bar . Okay , thanks . Chaima was a good friend . She was simple , but attractive . Full of life . She had big beautiful eyes , you know . We used to go out party , shopping , movies . We were close .

The man that 's sporting this tattoo " ... doesn 't need your help . Look , please . It 's really important . It 's a gothic tattoo . And , a special one . Ages ago , many cults existed in Fiji . They practised witch-craft . These spirits believed in supernatural beings . That means ghosts , spirits , spectres . Not just that . They would talk and see them . But , there 's only a handful left now . How can we get some more information ? Only one man can tell you about it . Father Patterson . Father Patterson ? Sacred Heart Church , Suva . Yes , but this tattoo must have been made in a local parlour , right ? Not necessarily . Those who follow this cult , can draw this tattoo themselves . Sam . It 's good thing , that you 're helping others . When people help others , they 're pardoned soon . Father , what does this tattoo mean ? It 's originated from the Greek language . 'Oro ' means tail . 'Boros ' means eating . 'Oro-Boros . ' This is a powerful Greek symbol . Ancient . And it means snake eating its own tail . Thus , he who eats his own tail . 'Oro-Boros . ' The circle of life . Life - Death - Rebirth . According to this , humans are immortal . Thank you , Father . - Thank you , son . Father . - Yes . Will you be forgiven ? Who dwells in me ? A troubled stranger . " I 'm away from myself and my soul is lost . " Everything is lying to me . I 've put many masks on my face . I 've got friends for one moment . In another moment everything was lost . " Who knows what the destiny holds for you . " One moment I get peace . Another moment I get restless . Whose support are we looking for on every way ? " I don ' ! get peace for even a single minute , my life is slipping away . " The destination is restlessness , every peace gets ruined . " It got ruined from my heart , all my peace .

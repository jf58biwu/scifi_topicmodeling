 I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on extant ... I 'm gonna have to turn down your warmers So you can get past the sensors . I know how to turn them on myself . Hey , little guy . I 'm running low on power . Did you see the gap ? 87 minutes . He was with odin at john 's house . If I 'm watching a one-of-a-kind sentient android , I might mention if I let him run out of power . This is commander pierre lyon of the triomphe . We have returned to them this woman . But she 's on the seraphim . She was alive this whole time . The seraphim is falling out of its orbit . It 's coming back to earth . It 'll disintegrate As soon as it hits the atmosphere . Geez ! No ! No ! - It 's okay . - If john Takes you to the lab and you think They 're gonna do something radical , I want you to get in touch with me . How ? This is a very special phone . Press this button and I 'm gonna know it 's you , And I 'm gonna come straightaway . Patient 's name is odin james . Are you sure you have the right number ? The explosion at yasumoto towers was a terrorist attack , Planned and executed by a machine . Gina ! Lock the door ! Ethan ! What did you do ? ! Hey . I 'm sorry , ethan . I ... Shouldn 't have yelled at you . I was trying to protect you . I-I know . But he just wanted to talk to me . And when you threw the ball , Well , it kind of ... Well , it really hurt him . Why do you care about him so much ? Because he 's my child . I thought that I was your child . You are . Then why is it different with him ? He 's having trouble processing it . It 's hard enough for a human to deal with rejection . For a machine , it 's ... Well , I didn 't reject him . He doesn 't know that . He 's in uncharted territory right now . And so are we . Okay . What are we gonna do about ethan ? I 'm gonna take him back to the lab . Try to find out exactly what odin did to him . But if julie 's right , if there is a bomb , I ... I don 't know What to do after that . I mean , I-I want to be at the launch , But , uh , it 's too dangerous with him . I know . It 's okay , don 't worry . What about this ... Other child ? I mean , what makes you think That he won 't try to stop you now that you 're going back up ? Well , they 're doing everything In their power to secure the building . He still wants to bring the seraphim down . So I can 't imagine he 's gonna stop now . How did we get here ? I 'm sorry , just ... I 'm so worried . Me , too . Come back to me , please . I will . I promise . At this time , We have no way of knowing if sean glass And katie sparks are still alive . If they 're alive , molly will bring them home . But before she does , she 's gonna redirect the seraphim Away from earth 's orbit . From the time she gets there , She 'll have just under two hours To seal it up and send it packing . Any longer than that , it 'll be too late . Dr. Woods ? Uh , if I should miss the opportunity To coordinate the move With mission control , I will go to plan b On my own . I 'll transfer fuel From the reserves and I 'll use the station 's thrusters To redirect the seraphim manually . It 's a less desirable option , But it 's better than the alternative . She 's gonna bring detonators to blow The separation bolts for emergency decommission . It 's an extreme measure , but considering What else is on board , it 's necessary . Phillips ? We know this being Or beings , what we 're calling " the spores , " Can somehow access our minds via proximity contact . They can make us see and do things beyond our control . We 're giving you the best defense we have ... The orphial 2nd-skin prototype , designed to withstand The radiation and electromagnetic fields Of the beyond mars missions . We don 't know how effective it will be , but it 's Our best bet at reducing the margins of uncertainty . Your helmet has been retrofitted With a specialized filter using The algorithm developed by your colleague . Algorithm danny 5 will allow you To essentially distinguish illusion from reality By showing these spores in their true form . This mission goes well beyond the bounds of acceptable risk . But these are extraordinary times , And they call for extraordinary courage . When this is over , we can Sit back and reflect on these events . But right now , this is a threat that must be contained . If the seraphim burns up on reentry , These spores could scatter Through the atmosphere and lead to mass infection . And this isn 't just about molly or sean glass Or katie sparks ; It 's about all nine billion of us . If you 're the praying type , Say a prayer for dr . Woods . If you 're superstitious , cross your fingers , Throw a pinch of salt . If you don 't believe in anything , Believe in her . Ben ? Hello , molly . Hey , buddy . Did you miss me ? I 've been running a probability analysis Based on the mission briefing . Don 't want to hear that right now . There appears to be a very slim margin For success and a high degree of risk ... You 're skating on thin ice here , buddy . Launch control to odessa ... Time to fly . Roger that . Stand by to initiate launch sequence . Standing by . T-minus 15 seconds . 14 ... 13 ... 12 ... 11 ... Ten ... Nine ... Eight ... Seven ... Six ... Five ... Four ... Three ... Two ... One ... Zero ... Launch ! Ben ? Any luck ? I tried each sector of the seraphim . Still no answer from sean or katie . Keep trying . And set the clock for 97 minutes . Hey ! Let me out of here ! Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Sean ! Molly ! We got to get your electrolytes up . Aw , god ! Katie , the real katie , she 's been dead for a while . It looks like something tore its way right out of her stomach . And the thing , the-the whatever it is , Sabotaged my communication , locked me in the aruna pod . Molly ! We need to go right now . We are going to as soon as we fix The com system and turn the station around . Why don 't we just let it burn up ? If the seraphim burns up on reentry , Those spores on the condensers Can very well make their way to earth . Right now , you and I Are the only two people that can stop it . I don 't want to die up here , molly . We are not gonna die up here . I 've got a family to get home to . All we have to do Is fix the comm system and make contact with the ground . And they 'll take it from there . And if they don 't , we 'll use the fuel reserves , Move it with the thrusters and be out of here . Okay , what 's first ? What happened to the comms ? She fried the power module to the antenna . Is there a spare in the shed ? At least one . That 's plan a . The explosion at yasumoto towers That destroyed the humanichs corporation laboratory Was a terrorist attack , Planned and executed not by our human enemies , But by a machine . Well , I don 't think it could 've been any clearer . He 's talking about a future attack . That doesn 't mean he already Planted the bomb . What do you think He did when he shut him down ? Maybe he made some changes In his program . He 's neural net is untouched . We can 't even get in there , and we 're not talking About a computer genius here . Okay , I want to open him up . John , that 's a bad idea . Do you have a better one ? Yes ! Call the bomb squad ! Put him in a shelter ! Do you know what the bomb squad will do ? They 'll take him and they 'll do a controlled explosion ! They 'll kill him ! We don 't know that . When he disappeared on the island , The sheriff acted like I lost a toy ! Other people don 't see him like we do . It 's too dangerous to do it here , john ! All I 'm saying is let 's be 100 % sure . Let 's shut him down , open him up and see for ourselves Before we get anyone else involved . Julie , tell him this is a bad idea . John , I know how you feel . He 's your son . We love him , too , but you 're putting Other people 's lives at risk ! I 'm putting people 's lives at risk ? Wait a second ... who brought odin here ? Who let him get close to ethan ? You ! Wait , come on , man ! That 's not fair . You can 't put this on her . If you want to call the police , Be my guest . If you want to go , go . But I 'm opening him up . No ! Ethan , just for a bit . We have to shut you down To see what odin did to you . We think he did something really bad . He 's my friend . He 's not your friend , rabbit . He was using us . That 's not true . He made a video saying that you wanted to hurt A lot of people . We could show it to you . Why would we lie to you , hmm ? Because you want to shut me down For good and never wake me up , exactly like he told me . I don 't want to shut you down for good . Yes , you do . You 're afraid of what 's happening to me . And mom doesn 't love me . Your mom loves you . We-we both do . I 'm not like you . I 'm like odin . That 's why we have to stick together . You know who sticks together ? Family , ethan . And you are my family . To-to shut you down for good ? My god , no . The-the whole point of bringing you home Was so we could give you the human experience . I-I would never do that to a human child , And I-I would never do that to you . I don 't believe you . Ethan , come on . Just stop this ... Ethan , where ... Where 'd you get that ? Odin gave it to me . He told me to call him if you were gonna shut me down . That he 'd come get me . Ethan , give me that phone . No ! Hey , I just want to see it . You don 't want me to call him . You 're right . I-I don 't . Because I think If you push that button , You 're going to blow the bomb And you 're gonna disappear forever . And not just you , But me , Julie and charlie , too . You 're going to kill us . Is that what you want ? No . Give me the phone . Please , buddy . Come on , rabbit . Don 't do this . I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do . Hey , I understand . I-I 'm asking you to do something You 're not designed to do . I 'm asking you to do the worst thing possible for a machine , To be shut down . But you 're not ... You 're not just a machine . You 're capable of so much more . You have to see yourself As human as I see you . You have to take a leap of faith . Ethan , I swear to you , On my life , Whatever happens , I 'll be right beside you . I will wake you up . Hey . Just give me the phone . Sean , I found the spare module . Headed back now . Molly ? Sean and I were just talking . We 're so surprised to see you here . I know you 're not her . What do you mean ? You 're not katie sparks . I 'm confused . Of course I am . The real katie Was a good person . She wouldn 't hurt anybody . So if you 're her , You 're gonna let me through that door . Okay . I know There 's a part of you Saying that you have to do this , But she 's a part of you , too . Just like my son is a part of me . Now , let me through that door . I can 't do that . Help me ! Katie locked me in here and I can 't get out ! Help ! Molly ? - I 'm here . - Let me out of here ! Sean ! Let me out of here ! What 's your 20 ? N-channel power bus . About to swap the module . Where are you ? Sean ... Looking at you . Look at me . It 's molly . In the shed . I need you to believe me . Do not go near that door . I locked katie in there . Do you hear me ? Let me out . Sean ... She 's making herself look like me . But it 's not me . Let me out ! Don 't worry . I 'll meet you at the hoses . Ready . What the hell is that ? Stand by gtcs . If she 's on schedule , We could see her any minute now . Sir ? It 's the same in every sector . Security feed must be frozen . It 's him . It 's the offspring . Everybody listen up . Building 's compromised . Switching to imp . Going to lockdown . What about molly ? We 're going to miss our window . She 'll go to plan b . If it 's in the building , We can 't trust ourselves to help her anyway . Let 's go , people ! Report to incident management teams . Clear out and fall back to the perimeter . Where is it now ? Moving toward sector 7 , stairwell d . Prepare for lockdown , on my go . Swapping out now , ben . Roger . Powering up new ones . Antenna up . T-coms full power . That 's it , ben . Phone home . Molly ? Yeah ? I 'm receiving an automated incident management protocol Response from mission control . They evacuated the building ? That is the standard course of action . All right . Glass , did you hear that ? Sean ? Ben , a little help here ? Could you use the transponder in his earpiece , please ? I 've located him Near the transfer hoses . Sean , whatever it is you 're seeing , It 's not real . Fight it ! It 's happening to me , too . Sean ... I 've been exposed , too . We 're just gonna have to push through it . Ben ... We got a change of plan . What happened ? He cut the line To the fuel transfer hoses . We 're going to plan c . The probability of success For an explosive decommission ... Ben , I swear to god , If you don 't shut up with that ... I 'm getting a distress signal . Has something happened to your helmet ? Yeah . I took it off . It doesn 't matter . My hand 's already been exposed . Are you able to complete the mission ? Yeah . I 'm gonna find glass , Sedate him And bring him back to the cockpit . - It 's called a honey bomb . - They 're designed To fix themselves permanently to their targets . Permanently ? They are incredibly unstable . If we try and dislodge it , tamper with a trigger , A violent shake , anything could set it off . We shouldn 't even be standing here . We should be calling in the bomb squad . No , we 're not doing that . He 's worried they 're gonna blow him up . It would only be His body , right ? Isn 't his program backed up somewhere ? We can 't back him up . Something happened to his program ; His growth just outpaced our technology . We 're not even close to catching up . Well , we 're out of time . We need to get somewhere safe , Then we can decide what to do . I 'm not leaving him . John . Look , I promised him I 'd be here . I-I-I swore I 'd wake him up . If john 's not leaving , I 'm not leaving . Not gonna happen , dude . Then let 's at least Clear the building . We 'll minimize the risk to the civilians . You two , come with me . You woke me up . Yeah . I promised I would . What is it ? I have something to tell you . It 's not easy to say , but ... I want you to know the truth . We were right to be worried . Odin put something Inside of you that could ... Explode and hurt a lot of people . Did you take it out ? No , we can 't . If ... We , uh ... Tried to move it , we might set it off , So the best thing we could do is ... Keep you safe until we figure out a way To back up your program . I thought that we couldn 't back up my program . Well , we 'll figure something out . I thought that he was my friend . That 's the other part of trust . You know ... Sometimes people are gonna let you down . Every now and then , You 're gonna be disappointed . Just like you were disappointed In your mom for yelling at you . I was trying to protect her . I know . Is she gonna die ? No ! Am I ? Come on . Sean ! I need to see you ! Sean ! No . No . No . No . Sean . Don 't do this ! So ... She 's just on her own ? She may have the other two astronauts . We just ... Don 't know . I 'll update you as soon as I hear anything . Why isn 't anyone helping her ? They can 't get into the isea . Because he 's in there ? Yeah . He can , uh ... Get into people 's minds And make them do things they don 't want to do . How ? Well , he has special powers . He does something to our brains that we can 't understand . Not mine . This doesn 't seem like A prudent course of action , considering . You said sean was exposed to the spores . How do you know he won 't contaminate the capsule ? I don 't . Ben , we are not gonna leave him . I was contaminated and I fought it . You just need to let me know when he wakes up . Ben ? Yes . Okay , I 'm gonna set the detonators On high-shear sep-bolts ; Put a timer on them . And when I get back , we 're only gonna have A couple of minutes before it goes off . So , we 're gonna have to launch the odessa As soon as possible . I 'll set the prelaunch protocol . You only have 23 minutes . Okay , well , wish me luck . I 'll apply the rules of probability . Oh , god , forget it . How much time Does she have ? If she went to plan b , She could have already sent the seraphim packing . She could be on her way home now with sean and katie . There 's just no way for us to know . Until ethan gets inside . John ... Hey . I 'm almost done with the upload . I don 't think it 's safe to send him in . Look , the other child can 't affect him . It manipulates other people via their biology . Ethan doesn 't have a biology . He 's still a threat . Look . Doesn 't matter who you call ... Swat team , army , police . Uh , they-they 're useless . It 's gonna turn them against each other . Ethan is the only one who can help her right now . You have to get him in . Okay . On the condition that you stay Where it 's safe . Ethan . Mr. Jackson gave us building schematics , Access codes ; Everything you need . I uploaded your neural net . Okay ? Since you 're not in the system , You 'll need to manually enter the codes On the keypads as you go . No , I won 't . He can wirelessly communicate With the isea system . Once you 're inside ... Make your way to the mission status room ... And try to reestablish contact with your mom . Remember ... Once you lift that lock , The offspring 's going to be running loose on the inside . You just need to be careful . I know . Come here . You sure you 're going to be okay ? Dad ... Trust me . Just ... Mr. Jackson 's gonna take you . The hazmat truck can only Get you so close ... you 'll have to Go the rest of the way on foot . Wait . 15 minutes until reentry . One more charge to go on the joint bolts . I 'm about to set the timer , Head back to the cockpit . What 's the status on glass ? Unconscious . Ben , initiate launch sequence . It 's time to go . Ben ? Ben ? Yes , molly ? Initiate launch sequence , please . I 'm afraid I can 't do that . What do you mean , you can 't do that ? I 've run the probability analysis Of returning with victims of infection . Well , he 's not infected ! It 's not just him ; It 's you , too . Okay , look , we don 't have time for this , ben . Initiate launch sequence right now ! That 's an order . We can 't accept the risk that you were contaminated . I urge you to reconsider . Manual override . Access denied . Ben , they 're gonna kill us If you don 't launch this capsule right now ! That is within the bounds of acceptable loss : Two lives to save billions . No . No , no , no . No , no , no . Ben ! Ben ! Ben ! Don 't do this ! Please , don 't do it ! Ben ? Mom ? Are you there ? Ethan ? Ethan ? So mr . Jackson let me in to help you . " Had to go outside . " Why ? He got into the building . He 's trying to stop you . I 'm sorry I was mad before you left . Oh , I 'm sorry , too , ethan . I wish we would have had more time to talk , honey . Dad says that when you get home , we 'll have another chance . I would love that . I would really , really love that . But right now I have some bad news , ethan . I 'm having a little bit of trouble launching . What kind of trouble ? I 'm having a little technical problem . And it seems like it 's something I can 't fix right now . Ethan , can you do something for me ? What ? I need you to take care of dad . Okay ? And I need you to tell him That I love him very , very much . Can you do that ? Dad ? Ethan ? Hey . - Is everything all right ? - John ? Mom wanted to tell you something , so I connected you . Molly ? I can 't launch . Ben won 't disengage from the seraphim . What happened ? He locked me out of the program ! And I already set the timers For detonation . I know I told you I was Coming home , sweetheart , but ... It doesn 't look like I 'm going to . I 'm sorry . I can help . I can control the whole system . I can control ben ! You need a person to be with you . Why ? Because the manual override uses A biometric authentication . It needs a-a heat signature Like a human hand to reboot the system To get past ben . It 's a fail-safe for a viral attack . Molly , we can get somebody in ! There 's not enough time ! I can do it . I can use my warmers . I can raise my temperature to 98.6 degrees . No , ethan , you can 't do that . Yes , I can . No , your system is not designed To withstand a temperature like that for a long time . You can develop an internal fire And trigger the explosive ! Ethan ? Listen to your dad . Ethan ? Ethan ! Don 't do it ! I think that this is my purpose . The other boy 's here now . He wants to stop me . I know he 's your son . I won 't hurt him again . Ethan , listen to me . You 're my son , too , and I don 't want anything To happen to you . So turn off your warmers , And get out of there right now ! Ethan , ethan , you can 't hold the temperature for much longer ! Ethan ! What 's going on ? You okay ? Mom , go ! What 's happening to his code ? Ethan ! You should really run now . Run ! We 're losing him . No . John ? Ethan ? Ethan ? Ethan did tell him to run . And there 's no evidence That he died in the explosion . Maybe he made it . I 'm sure he did . How do you know ? I just know . No one could explain how it happened . John set out to create a more human machine , but ... In the end , what he created was much more Than that . In those final moments , Ethan taught us something about what it means To be human ... how our connection to each other And our ability to love and sacrifice Transcends our physical forms . I 've never been a big believer in miracles , But there is one I 've come to embrace . Something time and space Have revealed to me over and over again . Whether by divine creation or cosmic accident , We made it here . We exist ... And that 's a gift . Rare and beautiful . Ethan ? Mom ? John ? John ? John ! Ethan ? Where are you ? I 'm here . I 'm everywhere . You all right , son ? It 's pretty cold outside . You must be freezing . Can we give you a ride home ? We aren 't gonna hurt you . It 's okay . Are you hurt , sweetheart ?

" EarthBuri Team Subs presents : ~ THERMAE ROMAE ~ " Roman Baths " [ AD 128 ] Translation and Editing : earthcolors : Spot translator and QC : danburi Special thanks to : furransu What do you mean my design is no good ? Why don 't you see it already , Lucius ... There are a growing number of innovative buildings lately . So what about it ? Your thermae designs are outdated . Outdated ? Romans nowadays have forgotten the good old times ... So I was just trying to reproduce ... There you are ! Here is the blueprint that you 've asked for . He 's a new thermae architect I just hired . I am Virtus . Pleased to meet you . You mean , you no longer need my services ? Sorry about that . Unless you have any innovative ideas ... do you ? So , Virtus , tell me about this ... In the middle , there 'll be a huge statue and there 'll be fountains all around ... [ Lucius , Thermae Designer ] You 're a fool ! [ Lucius , Thermae Designer ] [ Lucius , Thermae Designer ] You 're unemployed at a time like this ? I went all the way to Athens to learn the best architectural techniques ! But those guys ... Stop making such a fretful face that 's why lady luck runs away . Come on , smile a little . Do you want to play ? Hey , that 's enough ! Then why don 't you have a little fun with your wife , and forget about it , huh ? She 's been nagging you to give her a baby , right ? Fine , I 'm sorry ~ ! Let 's go to the bathhouse to freshen up . After all , Romans can 't do without baths . Wow ... sure is busy around here ~ ! Of course . Rome loves a bath more than any other country in the world . So refreshing . [ Thermae ( Public Bath House ) ] I heard that Emperor Hadrian loves baths , too ... A tyrant who kills senators is human too , I guess ... Tyrant ? Tip please . What , you don 't know ? Rumor has it that when Hadrian rose to the throne ... Four senators who opposed him were killed without any explanation . Not only that ... He 'll abandon a territory that took a lot of pains to conquer . Often goes on leisure travels and hardly stays in Rome ... What a ridiculous Emperor , huh ? As usual this place is so noisy ... The bathhouse is supposed to be a place to relax not a place for fighting arts or swimming ... Snacks , who wants snacks ? Even vendors have invaded it ... This place has lost its essence to be a relaxing space ... ! Hair removal here ! Snacks for sale ! You 're such a stiff ... That 's why you got fired . - " Hair removal , anyone ? " - Hey ! What 's wrong with them ... ! Honestly these guys ... They 're not aware that Romans are on top of the world ... If this goes on the fall of the Roman Empire may not be far off . I can only have a moment of peace under the water ... Gaudy bathhouses are currently the norm ... If I can only come up with an innovative idea to smash that trend ... An innovative idea ... An innovative idea ... An innovative idea ... Wha - ... What is this place ? T-That 's ... Is that Mt . Vesuvius of Pompeii ? ! Hey , sonny ... You were underwater for a really long time , weren 't you ? He isn 't a Roman . I wonder if he doesn 't understand our language ... Does he have someone with him ? Their faces are flat ! I see . I 'm in the public bathhouse for the slaves . It must 've been connected to where I was and I must have accidentally flowed in here . Foreigner-san ... You 've been in here too long , you might get dizzy ... You 'd better get some fresh air . " This is not the bathhouse for Romans so please leave ... " ... is that what he 's saying ? Well ... they do have a point ... After all this is the only place where they can relax . Even so , they have so many things that are like from advanced civilizations ... [ " Kerorin " * ] ( * A brand of painkillers ; these yellow buckets are meant as an advertisement but went on to become a common fixture in Japanese bathhouses ) Wha - ? ! Such a large piece of mirror ... Perfect illustrations on those notices ! They have craftsmen with such skills ... ? These slaves are amazing ... Is this where you put your clothes ? - I think we can make these things ... - Foreigner-san ... Were your clothes supposed to be in here ? Maybe they were stolen ? I can use these ideas ! It 's simple and functional than a bathhouse that places emphasis on luxury . If Rome wants innovation , then this is perfect ! [ Latin ] " Is it alright if I show this to my architect colleagues ? " I didn 't steal them ! Why does he look flustered ? Are they troubled and panicking because I 'm going to copy the style of their bathhouse ? I can understand the feelings of this tribe to treasure their bathing culture . But since they 're a province of Rome ... We , Romans have the right to absorb their culture into ours ! Hey ! Where are you going looking like that ? You can shout all you want , slaves ! There 's a sunshade cloth at the entrance ? I will be taking this idea , too . [ Inari-Yu Bathhouse ] Hey , where you going ? Is there something else you 're hiding ? Kenshiro * ? [ Tall and muscular hero of the manga / anime , " Fist of the North Star " ] Sorry ! Hey , let 's go , let 's go ! Sorry , ladies ... Yes , we 're really sorry ... Where exactly is this place ? Here , drink this ... It 's invigorating . Delicious ~ ! Come on , sonny ... I 'll open it for you . It 's delicious ! And ... it 's cold and sweet ! It 's milk ... but how come it tastes like fruits ? How on earth ... could they have possibly created something like this ? The people of this province has completely surpassed the Roman civilization ! Dammit ... I mustn 't cry ... They must not sense my feeling of defeat ... Lucius ~ ! Lucius ! Lucius ! He came around ! Where am I ? You were drowning in the bath and passed out ... Everyone got you out . Where 's the flat-faced tribe ? " Flat-face " ? What 're you talking about ? Glad you 're safe , man ... A dream ... ? [ A few months later ] Here it is ... the new thermae ... There hasn 't been any bathhouse like this before ! - What a nice basket . - It 's splendid . These advertisements are a great idea . I 've seen that comedy just the other day . Would you like to buy some milk juice ? Interesting bottle ! It 's now easy to know this week 's performances . - Give me one . - Thank you , sir . Everything is full of surprises ... Have a look over there , too . " Mt . Vesuvius and the Gulf of Naples ... " " Such a nice scenery ... " " How elegant ... " For the Gulf of Naples ... Roman pine trees are a must ... - I like the buckets ... - Isn 't it ? - So therapeutic ... Putting bottled milk in the cold underground was a really good idea , huh ? The ones over there were colder and sweeter ... And their bottles and lids were more refined . I really admire your enterprising spirit . - I 'll have a bottle . - Yes , thank you ! It wasn 't me ... The ones with an insatiable spirit of curiosity ... are those slaves ! The flat-faced tribe ... are not to be underestimated . Oh , Master ! You 're ready for your bath ? Soaking in a hot bath is the ultimate joy ... It would be nice to have your own bath at home ... Don 't say such extravagant ideas ! The only ones who can afford that are the rich and the aristocrats . It 's just wishful thinking ... Huh ? Master , where 's your strigil * ? ( * metal body scrub ) - Isn 't it that one ? - You 're right . That must be it . I 'll get it . It is certainly difficult for the elderly to get to the public baths ... I 'm sure some of the old folks will just give up bathing . For bath-loving Romans it 's like being deprived of a meaningful life . Is there anything I can do for them ... ? ... a bath at home . A bath at home ... A bath at home ... What is this place ? It feels so narrow ... And ... the water 's getting hotter ! It-It 's beginning to hurt ! What the- - Don 't tell me ... I went back to that world ? A coffin filled with hot water ... No ... it might be a bathing tub . If so , then they really have a deep obsession with baths . How could they have lit a fire in such a small space ? Being a slave isn 't easy ... What is this thing attached that looks like an intestine of an animal ? And this which covers the surface of the tub ... It 's used to block the heat from escaping ? Even if these objects look ridiculous at first glance they definitely possess some surprising elements . Rome is supposed to be a powerful civilization yet we have never thought of these methods ... This is what you stayed up for ... every night ? It 's absolutely bad ! Your story is nothing new ... And the characters are mediocre . You draw heroes with no impact ! One can 't be a cartoonist just by being good in drawing . Why don 't you just be a good daughter and go back to your hometown ? You just don 't have it ! Is the hot tub ready ... ? Dad ! The bathroom is across the hall . The caregiver is coming soon so just wait . Alright , Yoneko-san . It 's Michiko ! My caregiver 's a foreigner today , huh ? Then , please get started with my back . Look at the way it 's coming off ... ! Ouch ! Ouch ! You 're scraping off even my new skin . What material is this cloth made of ? Next , shampoo . A crown ? Is this old man the leader of the flat-faced tribe ? Wash it ... like this , see ? Rinse ... See ... My face doesn 't get wet , right ? This utter sense of defeat is truly beyond words ... A hero with impact ... The hero with impact ! Even this cylinder it 's equipped with features that you can 't find in my Roman civilization . My eyes , my eyes ! Where did the muscular foreigner go ? He 's gone . He escaped through the window ? Nope , he just disappeared . Poooff ~ ... [ One month later ... ] One minute you were fainting and drowning in the public bath ... then before you know it , you 've invented a home bathtub like this ... Along with that foam shielding brim and a tool made of a cow 's intestines used for rinsing . It 's really amazing ! Master , what do you think ? It 's the best ... I 'm in heaven ~ . See ! ? Look ! News about this has spread and there 's always curious people looking in . Your fame has increased even more . Master , your hot bath feels good , huh ? Marcus told me you 're the No. 1 architect in Rome right now . It 's a misunderstanding ... I just reproduce the things that I have seen . None of them was my invention . Whatever . Come on , eat . We have snails and goat testicles all are good in giving you energy . Surely , from this , you will give me children who will inherit your talent . What 's wrong ? I 'm not hungry . What ? You 're only making an excuse to avoid it ! You 're always like that ! All you do is just work work work ! You don 't even know how I feel ... I wanted to have children so much ! Not even once you responded to my needs ! You 're useless ! " Sorry to disturb you this late at night ! " " Is Lucius Modestus in ? " The Emperor wishes to meet with you . Emperor Hadrian ... Me ? - Ceionius-sama ... - You 're Lucius the Engineer , right ? The Emperor is waiting for you . From hereon we cannot go with you so you must enter alone . Mind you , the Emperor has a difficult temper . [ Ceionius , Heir ] If you utter a rude remark , I won 't be surprised if you 'll lose your head . [ Ceionius , Heir ] [ Ceionius , Heir ] I hope you 'll come back alive . Are you the designer of this bath ? I am Lucius Modestus , Your Majesty . A Mt . Vesuvius mural inside a thermae ... So absurd ... Nevertheless it 's truly impressive . Public baths and Roman roads are similar ... It should not be just grand ... It should not be just gaudy either . A place that gives relief leads to the well-being of the people . Absolutely ! [ Hadrian the Great , 14th Roman Emperor ] You and I think alike . [ Hadrian the Great , 14th Roman Emperor ] You must have the character of a tyrant as well . I know how people perceive me ... There is something I learned while traveling to all our provinces ... The Roman Empire is vast . There is a limit to how much our military can suppress rebellions ... The truth is ... If we can overwhelm them by our culture , then there is no need for war . So everything was your strategy to maintain peace in Rome , Your majesty ? To calm my mind and to peacefully ponder on the state of Rome I need a thermae . There is something I want to show you . I made a few alterations on your design . It 's so beautiful ... I want you to build me a thermae . I want unprecedented innovative ideas ... For the sake of the Roman Empire ... Lend me your strength . For the sake of the Roman Empire ... I understand . Please leave it to me . [ Villa Hadrian ] This villa was designed entirely by the Emperor himself . You have been assigned to design the Emperor 's personal bathroom , is that correct ? Yes , Antoninus-sama , however after seeing such workmanship by the Emperor ... The emperor is also a great architect too . But since he 's a rare genius he 's lonelier than we can ever imagine . With his struggle with the Senate there are only a few people whom he can open his heart to . And you are one of those chosen people . [ Antoninus , Emperor 's Aide ] Make a splendid thermae for him ... [ Antoninus , Emperor 's Aide ] ... so it will become his salvation . Build a bath here ... ? No good ... I can 't come up with an idea ... I wonder what would the flat-faced tribe do ... ? I know ! Maybe if I follow the path of the public bath 's drainage ditch I 'd be able to meet them . No no .. hold on ... Why should I rely on the civilization of that province ... But would I be able to come up with a good idea by myself ? I won 't have any future at all if I don 't meet the expectations of the Emperor ! To hell with my pride ! I will do away with my shame and ask for their help ... Hurry up , Lucius- - [ AD 2012 , Shinjuku , Tokyo ] Hey , Yamakoshi-kun ! Yes .. Don 't " yes " me ... The water almost overflowed ! Goodness ' sakes ... You 're always sleepy at work . You gotta work more seriously . If you think you can get a salary like that , you 're wrong ! I 'm so sorry . You must be staying up late at night ... It 's the flat-faced tribe ... This water is hideously boiling ! But it doesn 't feel hot , why ? Is he a friend of yours ? It 's kinda like a totally open relationship ... You actually brought a man to your workplace ! No ... What is this vibration ? This quivering sensation ... Feels good ~ Hey , you ! Get out of there ! Ouch ! Let go ! How dare you touch my robes , you rude slave ! Are you ok ? You think you can come in here and do your hanky-panky ? ! Manager ! " Manager " ? Uh , no ... Geez , what are you doing ? [ Latin ] " Well ... Since I 'm here , let me fully learn your civilization . " I see ... If she is to guide me , she would want a reward . How sly ... these slaves are . Thanks . Uh , wait ... wait , wait ! Such a strange character ... There are text written on this papyrus . These writings must be the key in unraveling the civilization of this flat-faced tribe . [ " The baby who poos properly will be praised . " ] These writings must be the key in unraveling the civilization of this flat-faced tribe . " Manager , this way ! " My Boss is coming ! H-Hey ... What is this space ... ? I have no words to describe this scent ... And it 's coming from these candles ? It feels soothing ... What the heck is that ? A glass tank embedded in the wall ? ! It feels even more soothing with this ... It 's not only the bathing tubs ... They are utilizing the full use of the space in designing the bath ... I , who can only mimic the books and the Greek ideas could never come up with anything like this . Sure enough , I am not cut out to make the Emperor 's bath ... I think my stomach is ... " Latrine ! " " W-Where is your latrine ? " Toilet ? The toilet is over there . A lid ... ? It may look like a good idea at first ... [ " It automatically opens and closes the lid " ] It may look like a good idea at first ... But for people like me who are in a hurry ... I don 't want to be bothered to open- - Just for this latrine , how many slaves are they using ? Must be hard to be a slave ... Oh , I see now ... it 's a reading material while one is on the latrine . Where is the buttocks wiper ? [ Buttocks ] That thing just now was it a function that cleanses the buttocks ? Indeed it 's a much cleaner method to wipe our buttocks than moistened sponge . [ Wonder Wave Cleansing ] What is this feeling ... ? [ Wonder Wave Cleansing ] It feels addicting ... Where is that man ? Is he inside ? Manager ! " Nobody 's here . " " This is the proof ! Please look ! " Yamakoshi-kun ... You 're fired . [ After several months ... ] It was really embarrassing ... [ After several months ... ] ... to have almost drowned in His Majesty 's villa ... That 's enough ... You 've survived and I 'm able to enjoy immersing myself in this bath of bubbles . And that latrine ... I would never imagine a latrine that can cleanse the buttocks . I 'm glad there is a citizen like you who doesn 't just imitate other cultures . With this bath I can reflect on the future of Rome . All of these are possible thanks to you . You will be rewarded immediately . So buy your wife something good . I am greatly honored ! Livia ...

The boy , Antinous , with whom the Emperor had opened his heart and mind to lost his life in Egypt 's River Nile . His Majesty has completely lost his will to live ... Antinous was my reason for living . The only thing in mind right now are those days I spent with Antinous ... The fertile banks of the Nile where sacred crocodiles appear ... The indescribable aroma and the sweetness of the fruits that we ate ... Now that Antinous is dead my world has also stopped . This crocodile is the incarnation of Antinous ... I have brought it from the Nile . However , this Nile crocodile can only survive in the Nile . If this crocodile dies that may be the end of me . What are you saying ? I 'm looking forward to more of His Majesty 's achievements . I see ... Yer good ! I done it ! - Oh , I see ... - Is dat the ancient Roman dude ? Yer good in drawing ' as usual , Mami-chan .

I am thinking of taking Ceionius as my adopted son . " Ceionius-sama ? " For Ceionius ... " " As his first project ... " " ... I 'm planning to order him to construct a large bath for the public ... " " I want to leave you in charge of this construction ... " " I want you to build a thermae ... " " ... that will surpass those of the previous emperors . " " That way ...

" " I am sincere ... " Sorry to make you wait , Ceionius-sama . You 've worked hard . Who is she ? We just met . Don 't worry about her . I heard you 're going to build a bath here in my name . Yes . The Emperor really goes to too much trouble Trying to win the sentiments of the people by building a trivial bath for them . With all due respect ... The baths are an integral part of Roman life ... A bath is a bath , that 's all there is to it , right ? Anyway , since you 're at it , make it a gorgeous bath . Uhm ... If I refuse to build it ... ? Then , you would be going against the wishes of the Emperor . It would be an act of treason punishable by death . Must I build the thermae for him ... ? You 're the thermae engineer , aren 't you ? Because of you , I can 't find any work at all ! What 're you saying ... Shut up ! My back ... He awoken up ... Thank goodness ... The ground is so warm ... Geothermal ... ? Huh ?

Me too ... Lookit here .. I fell off the roof while doin ' carpentry work . Is this bath built exclusively for wounded soldiers ? I didn 't realize it since I was captivated by the beauty of this open-style bath . Just geothermal and mineral hot springs water seems to have some sort of healing capacity . Come on , eat sum hot springs eggs . Eat up ! C 'mon eat ... It 's yo ' first time , ain 't it ? It 's good ! Dang it ~ ... . Look at his face .

This has nothing to do with you . - Let me go ! - Didn 't she say she doesn 't want to ? What 're you doing ? Let go . Don 't think that I 'll let this pass . Thank you very much . Not at all . Lucius-dono ... Are you really going to build a bath for Ceionius-dono ? Regarding that matter I am going to decline it . Do you know what you are saying ? Refusing the request of the Emperor is a capital offense ! Of course I am aware of it . Wait a minute ... Are you really serious in going to the battlefield ? Why are you refusing to build it ? Even if someone is unsatisfied with his work everyone still has to put up with it . That 's how we do things in my country ... If that 's the case , then it must be a sad country . As a bath engineer , I have my pride . I cannot make a bath that is against my principle . Your stubbornness will get you killed ! Let go . I won 't ... If I do , you 'll wind up dead . Don 't you value yourself ? I do value myself ... That 's why I 'm going . I don 't want to kill my principles and keep living . Lucius ! " Hear ye ! " " I will announce the newly-appointed governor to the province of Pannonia . " " The one appointed as governor ... " ... to the province of Pannonia is Proconsul Antoninus ! Where did he go ? It 's really rotten ! Huh ? Isn 't dat Mami-chan 's ... ? Don 't tell me ... she drowned ? No way ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami ! Mami , whur are ya ? Pops , are you okay ? Pops ~ ! The water 's deep ? " The enemy is continuing to increase their reinforcements ... " " Listen up ! We must send ... " ... a message regarding our strategy to the troops fighting in the front lines ... Your Majesty , Engineer Lucius is here to see you . What 's the matter ? You have some important task to be done . Actually that is what I wish to talk about . I cannot bring myself to build a bath for Ceionius-sama . I am truly sorry ! You cannot recognize Ceionius as an Emperor Is that what you 're saying ? I know it 's very rude of me . I am prepared to receive punishment ! I understand . Enough . To you I do owe my life . - Your Majesty ... - However ... Do not appear before me again ! Take him away ! Come . It 's warm ... Acetic ... It is the same as that of the spa . What 're you doing ? Get away from there ! Do you want to die here ? Scram ! You 're a nuisance ! Thank God ! You 're alive ~ ... You 're hurting me . I 'm sorry . Did anything happen during my absence ? Oh right ... Antoninus was supposed to go to the province of Pannonia . ... for 5 years . 5 years is a long time . It was because of me , wasn 't it ? No doubt that Ceionius-sama had a hand in that decision . But it 's inevitable for a person with a high-ranking status to be dispatched to the provinces ... Don 't worry about it . Wait a minute ... What year are we in now ? AD 135 . It was in 140 AD ... What should we do ... We 've changed the history ! The truth is ... it was Ceionius who was supposed to go to Pannonia he would die in a plague there and Antoninus will take his place as Emperor ... It 's a historical fact ! Antoninus will ... ? If we leave it as is , Ceionius will be Emperor ... I have no idea what you 're saying . Listen carefully . If Antoninus does not become Emperor then Hadrian will not be deified . What do you mean ? The Senate hates Hadrian , right ? That 's why they were against his deification but Antoninus persuaded them . It was then they allowed Hadrian to be deified . Such a story ... is too hard to believe . But I 'm the only one you can trust ! If he is not deified , then all of the Emperor 's achievements will be eliminated . Not only that Emperor Hadrian will go down in history bearing the stigma of a foolish emperor . Ceionius-sama ! I have something to ask you ... If you become his heir will you support the deification of Emperor Hadrian ? The Emperor is at odds with the Senate . Such deification will be difficult . What do you want from me ? I heard you 've refused to build the bath for me . Now are you trying to ask something of me ? What a foolish man ... Throwing away your future ... at a moment of impulse . Now , I 'm not so sure if you really had any talent at all ... What did you really do to get your fame ? Or are you just a sham ? Lucius . Are you alright ? Aren 't you Engineer Lucius ? I didn 't expect to meet you here ! Your bathhouses are the best ! And I can 't get enough of your bottled cow 's milk ... Stop it ! I am not the kind of person that you think I am ! Hold on a sec ! Hey , Lucius ! I 'm incompetent . I got the position to serve the Emperor only because I copied your hot baths . I 'm just someone who stole other people 's technology ! Do you really believe that ? Then , let me ask you ! Why did you almost drown so many times ? Isn 't it because you tried so hard to think of ways to meet the expectations of others ? It 's because you were constantly thinking of your troubles it was then you were able to see our world . That 's the answer you found with your own hands ! You are NOT incompetent . You have nothing to be ashamed of ! If I can prevent Antoninus from going to Pannonia ... Then everything will be restored ... ? I 'm sure of it . Lucius-dono , what is it ? Antoninus-sama , I have something important to tell you . Go over this mountain , our troops can attack the enemy from behind ... " What 're you doing ? You cannot enter ! " Bastard ! Lucius , you bastard ! Why are you here ? ! Lucius , did you forget my words ? I am so sorry but today I have come to tell you a message from Antoninus-sama ... Antoninus ? I have accepted the proposal of Antoninus-sama to build a bath here . On the battlefield ... ? The soldiers are exhausted ... In this area there are mineral springs that are effective in healing a person 's wounds ... You fool ! How could a bath have that kind of effect ? It IS true ! If our Roman soldiers are able to recover ... . ... our army 's victory will be within reach ! Very well . Let us accept Antoninus ' proposal . Then ... I will begin right away . Lucius . This was your idea , wasn 't it ? No . It was Antoninus-sama 's . I see . You 're really going to build a hot springs bath here ? Yes . If this can help contribute to the war effort Antoninus-sama may gain more support and his Pannonia appointment will be withdrawn . The soldiers are also worn out . This is the only way . We can 't make it in this condition . Poppa ! Oh , ain 't that ... ? Mami ? ! Why are you here ? I really dunno ! We wur drowning ' , then when we a-woke up we wur in the middle of a battlefield then here we are now . I reckoned you wur dead ! Aww , Poppa ~ ! Nah ! Seems it ain 't so ... I reckon we 're ALL dead ... And dis here place is the underworld ! Whur 's my wife ? ! Ma ~ ! Elder ... Elder ! We 're in Rome . We 're in Ancient Rome , year 135 AD . No way ... It 's true ! We 're ... What 're they doin ? - They 're buildin ' a hot springs bath . - Hot springs ? ! Oh ... What fo ' ? In order to solve the crisis in Rome ! Nah ~ ! It really is true ! Even if yo ' certain ... Turnin ' this place into a hot springs bath ... It 's gonna take years . But we have to . Take advantage of the mineral springs here and turn them into a therapeutic bath ... ... in order to heal everyone 's injuries ! Injuries ? Listen ... You can build a row of Ondol huts over yonder ... Ondol huts , look ... See ? You can build sev 'ral huts all in a row ... and jus ' place sum mats inside . That 's it ! You shud build some huts here line em up all in row ... The ground 's warm ... The soldiers can rest here . It 'll heal the wounds ... Here ... Steam , steam ! Heal wounds ... cure em diseases . Still ... Why do they want to help ? They 're not going to receive any honor for this . I really don 't understand the ways of this flat-faced tribe . Ready , set ... They constantly act together ... Sacrificing themselves for someone ... For them there are more important things other than honor . Professor . How is it ? Is it okay ? Look ! Hot springs ! The hot springs ARE in here ! We found it ! See ~ ? First hut done ! Thanks for the hard work . We 've done it ! " The rebels ' momentum has increased ... " Our soldiers are suffering from the enemy 's poison and unable to use their full strength . Let em rest inside da Ondol . Everyone , this way ! Then all we can do now is to leave the rest to him . Elder ! " Your Majesty , the soldiers have recovered from their illness . " " ... and began to return to the battlefield . " I ain 't gonna lose to you , Mister ! Watch where you 're going . Are they dun , I wonder ... Come , drink the mineral water ... Here , drink up . You draw very well . I 'm making illustrated instructions on how to use the hot baths . Actually , you see ... Comics- - Umm ... I initially wanted to work drawing pictures ... But I had no luck whatsoever ... So I gave it up ... and tried to find me a husband instead . Then you appeared over there . Me , too ... I 'll try again . I am thankful that we met . I 'm really ... You ain 't even listenin ' ! Long live the Roman Empire ! Long live ! You 're looking good , I 'm glad . Long live ! Love live the hot springs ! I can 't believe it ... My injuries are healing in this bath . These eggs are the best ! I feel getting my strength back . Now , I 'm finally able to return home to my wife who 's waiting in Rome . The North Star ... That is the star that guides the way . When a traveler is lost that star will show him the way . I see . It 's there even 2000 years ago , huh ? Of course . Did Emperor Hadrian 's achievements pass on to your time , too ? Of course . He 's well-known around the world . I see . I 'm sure the baths you built will also be passed on ... Just to protect the honor of Emperor Hadrian ... is enough for me . The smoke ... my eyes are tearin up ! I must thank you ... Thanks to you ... I have regained my self back . Aww , shucks , stop it . To borrow your words ... I 'll also continue to try . So you WERE listening . Thank you ... I 'm really glad to have met you . You 're so mean ... It 's the first time you smiled at me . So unfair . What 's this ? I see ... So that 's how it was ... Each time I shed tears in your country I went back to Rome . You mean , I 'm going back ? I see ... We 'll see each other again , right ? For sure we 'll meet again . Because ... All roads lead to Rome . " Whur are we ... ? " Whut a relief ~ ! We shure missed home ! Whut in tarnation ya 'll doing ' back there ? Ya 'll still foolerin around ? Git yo ' butts outta there ... NOW ! Yes 'm ~ ... " The Roman Army ... " [ One month later ... ] [ One month later ... ] " ... was able to overpower the rebellion splendidly . " [ One month later ... ] This victory was made possible due to everyone 's efforts ! Above all I want to praise Antoninus for his proposal to have a thermae built in the battlefield . Come forward . Thanks to your excellent work . As you wish ... I will assign someone else to the province of Pannonia . And ... you will remain in Rome . I am deeply grateful . There is also another person whom I want everyone to give honor to for building the thermae . Lucius Modestus ! Come forth . Do you really think I won 't see through your white lie ? Splendid work ! I am not to be credited . But in behalf of everyone ... I accept your gratitude . Lucius ! Congratulations , Lucius !

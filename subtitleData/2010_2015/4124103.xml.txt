 MAN : The Grid . A digital frontier . I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer . What did they look like ? Ships ? Motorcycles ? Were the circuits like freeways ? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I 'd never see . And then , one day ... BO y : y ou got in . MAN : That 's right , man . I got in . MAN : And the world was more beautiful than I ever dreamed and also more dangerous than I ever imagined . Hop in bed , now , kiddo . - Now , I met a brave warrior . - Tron . ( VOvALlZlNG ) Bom-ba-bom-bom bom ! Tron' BO y : He fights for the users . MAN : He sure does . Oh , man , he showed me things that no one had ever imagined . There were these disk battles fought in spectacular arenas . vycles that raced on ribbons of light . It was so radical . MAN : And together ... BO y : y ou built the Grid . MAN : We built a new grid for programs and users . Now , I couldn 't be in there all the time , so I created a program in my own image that could think . Like you , and me . And I called him viu . - vodified Likeness Utility . - MAN : That 's right . And viu , Tron and I , we built the system , where all information was free and open . Beautiful . And then , one day , something happened . Something extraordinary . A miracle . What was it ? That 'll have to wait till next time . I gotta get to work . I wanna go with you , Dad . y eah , well , one day you will . I promise . - To the Grid ? - ( LAUGHS ) Good night , Sam . Hey , what do you say tomorrow you and I hit the arcade ? y ou can have a crack at the old man 's high score . - First game 's on me . - ( vHlNK OF vOlN ) van we play doubles ? On the same team ? We 're always on the same team . ( motorbike engine STARTS ) ( THUNDER ) Good evening . Our lead story . EncO M ceo and video game icon kevin flynn has disappeared . he was best known for designing Tron and Space paranoids , the two bestselling video games in history . flynn took ownership of EncO M in 1 982 as the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry . But things changed in 1 985 with the untimely death of flynn 's wife , the mother of his young son , Sam . recently , EncO M board members have been troubled by reports of flynn 's erratic , even obsessive , behavior . With flynn missing , the company is now in chaos . This afternoon , EncO M 's board moved to seize control from flynn 's partner , Alan Bradley , vowing to return the company to profitability . loyal to the end , Bradley maintains his belief that flynn is not missing and is instead pursuing his dream of " a digital frontier to reshape the human condition . " kevin : In there is a new world . In there is our future . In there is our destiny . ( applause AND vHEERlNG ) TV : Even flynn 's most ardent supporters are now acknowledging a difficult truth . kevin flynn may have simply run away . And while flynn 's loyalists hope for his imminent return , there is perhaps no one who wishes it to happen more than young Sam flynn , now in the care of his grandparents , and heir to an empire in turmoil . SAM : He 's coming . He promised . - Sam , you have to eat . - Let go of me Sam ? What will become of flynn 's legacy and the future of EncO M will most likely depend on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy . on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy .

Tonight I am pleased to announce that ENvOM 's last fiscal year was our most profitable ever . y es . ( applause ) At midnight the 1 2th version of our flagship operating system will hit the shelves around the world . I 'm sure it comes as no surprise whom we have to thank . The head of our software design team , a man whose father 's own notable history with ENvOM helped make this company what it is today . Edward Dillinger . Well done . Well done . And this year , simultaneous to the release of ENvOM OS-1 2 , we will be making our debut on Tokyo 's Nikkei lndex . ENvOM 's stock will now trade around the world 2 4l7 . - ( whooping ) - Huh ? Oh , yes . ( beep ) ( ALARM ) - Excuse me . - y es , Alan ? ALAN : Given the prices that we charge to students and schools , what sort of improvements have been made in Flynn ... I mean , ENvOM OS-1 2 ? - This year we put a " 1 2 " on the box . - ( LAUGHTER ) OS-1 2 is the most secure operating system ever released .

Our most valuable and most secure operating system is out there for free How am I supposed to explain that ? I don 't know . Say it was all part of the plan . A little gift from ENvOM . TV : Apparently , EncO M Technology is having some technical difficulties . Why don 't we give them a chance to sort things out ? Hey , Dad . How you doing ? - GUARD : Where you gonna run to now ? - Hey , you don 't wanna do that . GUARD : Didn 't anyone tell you ? Stealing is wrong . SAM : y ou can 't steal what was designed to be free . - Now I got you . - y our boss is okay with this . The hell he is . SAM : y our boss works for the vEO and the vEO works for the shareholders .

That was Marv 's idea . ( LAUGHS ) Alan , are we really going to do this again ? Do I really look like I 'm ready to run a Fortune 500 company ? No . And truthfully , the company is pretty happy with where you are , too . I bet . That way they can keep doing whatever they want . y ou know , I guess what I find curious is the crazy charities , the annual prank on the company . y ou have an interesting way of being disinterested , Sam . Why are you here , Alan ? I was paged last night . Oh , man , still rocking the pager ? ( LAUGHS ) Good for you . y eah , your dad once told me I had to sleep with it , and I still do . page came from your dad 's office at the arcade . - So ? - So ? That number 's been disconnected for 20 years . Sam , two nights before he disappeared , he came to my house . " l 've cracked it , " he kept saying . He was talking about genetic algorithms , quantum teleportation . He said he was about to change everything . Science , medicine , religion . He wouldn 't have left that , Sam . He wouldn 't have left you . Oh , Alan. y ou 're the only one who still believes that . He 's either dead or chilling in vosta Rica . probably both . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm tired , and I smell like jail . Let 's just reconvene in another couple of years , huh ? What do you say ? Here . These are the keys to the arcade . I haven 't gone over there yet . I thought you should be the one . Alan , you 're acting like I 'm gonna find him sitting there working . just , " Hey , kiddo . Lost track of time .

Dinner soon . We 'll talk then . He never thought he 'd see you again . y eah . Vintage . Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games . qUORRA : It doesn 't get out as much as it used to , but it 's still the fastest thing on the Grid . ( vHUvKLES ) qUORRA : Do you know it ? His patience usually beats out my more aggressive strategy . Flynn shared them with me . I 've read them all . Oh . Light reading . Tolstoy . Dostoyevsky . I-ching . Journey Without Goal . Must have a killer ending . Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless , about removing oneself from the equation . But between you and me , jules Verne is my favorite . - Do you know jules Verne ? - Sure . What 's he like ? ( THUNDER ) y our move , Flynn , come on . vome on ( vUTLERy vLlNKS ) qUORRA : How old are you now , Sam ? kevin : y ou should be 2 7 . SAM : y es , 2 7 . qUORRA : Do you attend a college ?

Marvin . - A rescue . - kevin : Well , dogs ... Dogs are cool . I 'm sure you must have a few questions of your own , Sam . Actually , just one . Why I never came home . Those nights when I went to the office , I 'm sure you 've figured it out by now , I was coming here . Human form into digital space . Heavy stuff . But I also had you . I had ENvOM . I couldn 't be in here all the time . I needed partners to help out . Tron and viu ? That 's right . kevin : Tron was created by Alan for the old system . I brought him here to protect this one . clu was my creation . A program designed to create a perfect world . We were jamming , man , building utopia . Hours in here were just minutes back home . just when I thought it couldn 't get any more profound , something unexpected happened . The miracle . The miracle . y ou remember . lSOs. isomorphic algorithms . - A whole new life form . - And you created them ? ( LAUGHS ) No . No . They manifested , like a flame . They weren 't really from anywhere . The conditions were right and they came into being . for centuries we 've dreamed of gods , spirits , aliens , an intelligence beyond our own . y ou seeing this ? I found them in here . like flowers in a wasteland . Profoundly naive . Unimaginably wise . ( vHUvKLES ) They were spectacular . Everything I 'd hoped to find in the system , control , order , perfection , none of it meant a thing . I 'd been living in a hall of mirrors . The lSOs shattered it . The possibilities of their root code , their digital DNA . Disease ? History . Science , philosophy , every idea man has ever had about the universe up for grabs . Bio-digital jazz , man . The IS Os , they were going to be my gift to the world . SAM : So what happened ? kevin : vlu. viu happened . TRON : y our transport to the portal is waiting for you . I don 't like it when you cut it this close . kevin : Will you stop worrying , Tron ? Everything 's just fine . - Everything 's under control . - vLU : Flynn' Am I still to create the perfect system ? y eah . kevin : It was a coup . TRON : Go . vLU : y ou 've been corrupted . Why ? Why ? Flynn , go ( TRON yells ) kevin : Tron , he fought for me . I never saw him again . So why didn 't you fight ? - kevin : Hmm . - He did . kevin : viu fed on my resistance . The more I fought , the more powerful he became . It was impressive , really . And my miracle ... clu saw the IS Os as an imperfection . So he destroyed them . ( distant SvREAMlNG ) The purge . - He killed them all ? - lt was genocide . I tried to get back but I couldn 't get to the portal . It uses massive power and it can 't stay open forever . And like a safe , it ... It can only be opened from the outside . It closed on me , Sam . That 's why I never came home . SAM : So the portal , it activated when I came in . So it 's open now . kevin : Not for long . Only one millicycle , about eight hours . So we go now . Go home . We make a run for it . - We get you out of here . - Don 't rush . What do you mean ? The portal 's gonna close . What ? What is it ? The moment Flynn is on the Grid , viu will stop at nothing to obtain his disk . My disk is everything , Sam . It 's the master key . The golden ticket . The way out . - And not just for me . - What do you mean ? Our worlds are more connected than anyone knows . vlu figures if I can be in ... SAM : He can be out ? kevin : With my disk , it 's possible . SAM : And then what ? Game over . The guy doesn 't dig imperfection . What 's more imperfect than our world ? I can 't let that happen. I won 't . So what do we do ? Nothing ? It 's amazing how productive doing nothing can be . vlu 's planning something . We 've known that for a while . programs have been disappearing . There 's unrest out there , even revolution . If we sit tight , viu might be brought down from the inside . SAM : If the portal is closing , we can 't sit around . We have to move now . Tell me , what brought you here , to the Grid ? Alan got your page . I didn 't send any page . It was viu . vlu sent that page . That 's why you 're here . This is all his design . He wanted a new piece on the board to change the game With you , he got more than he ever dreamed . This is precisely what he wants . Us together heading for the portal . It 's his game now . The only way to win is not to play . Well , that 's a hell of a way to live . But it is a way . We can go home . Don 't you want that ? Sometimes life has a way of moving you past things like wants and hopes . That 's great , Dad . Keep telling yourself that . Good night , Sam . How can he be so afraid of his own creation ? I mean , he built viu . Why doesn 't he just end him ? He could , but it would require reintegration . y eah , all right . Flynn would never survive the event . It would mean the end of them both . ( sighs ) lf he refuses to save himself , then I will . How ? I 'm going through the portal . vlu wants Flynn 's disk , not mine . I 'm going to find Alan and we 'll figure this thing out from the other side . This may be viu 's game here , but in my world , he 's gone in one keystroke . But I can 't do anything unless I get to the portal . And my guts tell me that you don 't want to be stuck in this place for eternity either . I really think you should consider your father 's wisdom . I have . ( KNOvKlNG AT DOOR ) There 's someone I once knew , a program named Zuse who fought alongside the isos . They say he can get anyone anywhere . SAM : How do I find him ? qUORRA : This is his sector . Make it there alive , and he 'll find you . ( SEAGULLS vRy in THE DlSTANvE ) ( sighs ) Sam ? Sam ? vOMpUTER : All programs are required to present identity disks at city checkpoints . Hey , man. lt 's your lucky day . - Any program without their disk ... - Stop him ! ... will be taken into custody . Any program in violation of their function is subject to termination . FEMALE VOlvE : Sam Flynn ? y ou remember me ? - y eah. y ou gave me some advice . - And you followed it . It 's unfortunate we met the way we did . y ou have a good night . y ou 're looking for someone . What makes you say that ? Intuition . Sir , the sentries downtown have recovered Flynn 's light cycle . We 've traced it to its point of origin . kevin : prepare the light runner , quorra . We 're going downtown . Thank you for bringing my son to me . qUORRA : Flynn' y ou don 't need to go . I 've sent him to someone we can trust . quorra , there is no choice . I won 't lose him again . vhaos . Good news . - ( lively vHATTER ) - ( pounding MUSlv ) Relax . They 're occupied . ( LAUGHTER ) His name is vastor. lf you want to speak to Zuse , you need to go through him . vASTOR : Where 's your sense of humor , my friend ? MAN : programs are disappearing . Soon none of us will be left . Zuse can unite the factions , foment revolution . - Of course Zuse can do these things . - Grant me an audience . y our enthusiasm is intoxicating , my dear Bartik , but Zuse 's time is precious . We shall see . I brought your boy Flynn . If you 'll excuse me for a moment , I have to attend to something .

By necessity , he has to mind all the percentages . All the angles . So when do I meet him ? y ou just did . ( LAUGHS ) After the purge , I needed to reinvent myself . Self-preservation , you understand . Now , what can I do for you ? I need to get to the portal . Well , it 's closing quickly , as I 'm sure you 're aware . Tick-tock , tick-tock . And it 's quite the journey . Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands . y our father didn 't want any programs slipping out accidentally , did he ? - van you help me ? - Of course . But first , as a man who prides himself on staying well informed , I must ask who sent you my way . Her name 's quorra . Said she met you a long time ago . Indeed she did . Many cycles ago . It was a different time . But we 're not here to relive the past . Let 's see about your future , shall we ? We 'll have to change your attire and you 'll need a forged disk . Not easy these days . And of course you 'll need transport to cross the Sea of Simulation . This is going to be quite the ride . ( SvREAMlNG ) ( MUSlv vHANGES ) I believed in users once before . playing all the angles .

She 's stable . - SAM : So what do we do now ? - l don 't know . Nothing . We do nothing . Be still . Wait . y ou ever jump a freight train ? Huh ? We do it your way . Full-on sprint to the portal . If we beat viu there , we have a chance . Let 's get her out of here . This 'll take us there . - ls she gonna make it ? - l don 't know . I 've got to identify the damaged code . The sequencing is just enormously complex . - SAM : But didn 't you write it ? - Some of it . The rest of it is just beyond me . She 's an iso . kevin : y eah . The last iso . SAM : All this time , you were just protecting her . kevin : She 's the miracle , man . Everything I ever worked for . " A digital frontier to reshape the human condition . " SAM : I always thought that was just a plug line . kevin : In our world , she could change everything . y eah . ( LAUGHS ) vheck that out . She risked herself for me . Some things are worth the risk . kevin : Look at this . Now , that is impressive if I do say so myself . Huh ? vome on , it 's gonna take a while for her system to reboot . Now it 's time for you to tell me a story . vLU : The boy and Flynn are gone . vASTOR : I presume , y our Excellency , they perished in the elevator . y ou presume ? Find them . SAM : lcecaps are melting , war in the Middle East , Lakerslveltics back at it . I don 't know . Rich are getting richer , poor are getting poorer . veil phones , online dating , Wi-Fi . - kevin : What 's Wi-Fi ? - Wireless interlinking . - Of digital devices ? - y eah . Hmm.

Mac when I was 1 2 and Gram five years later . y ou remember that night when you didn 't come home ? - Well ... - y ou said ... I said I 'd show you the Grid . y ou should have seen this place back then . I couldn 't wait to show it to you . vould not wait . SAM : Must have been something before viu screwed it up . No , no , he ... He 's me. I screwed it up . vhasing after perfection . vhasing after what was right in front of me . Right in front of me . Look what you 've accomplished . It 's incredible . Sam , I 'd have given it all up for one more day with you . ( sighs ) Hey . Remember your old Ducati ? y ou kidding ? Not a day goes by I don 't think about that bike . - y eah , well , I 'm fixing her up . - y ou busted my bike ? Twenty years in the shed , no tarp . I mean , she needed a little love .

The old man 's gonna knock on the sky , listen to the sound . vASTOR : When Flynn entered the space , ah , everything changed . I 've never seen anything quite like it . The awe was palpable . - Was it ? - l presume our understanding is still valid ? vontrol of the city ? A sizeable request , I know . But seemingly fitting compensation . Don 't you think ?

How did you find him ? It 's okay . I know . qUORRA : It was during the purge . vlu was relentless . The Black Guard were executing lSOs in the streets . Everyone I knew disappeared . Then they came for me . So I ran . A sympathetic program smuggled me out of the city . But soon they had me surrounded . I prepared for the end . And just as everything was going dark , I felt a hand on my shoulder . And when I opened my eyes , standing above me was the vreator . y our father . He saved me . I guess you could say I 'm a rescue . SAM : Hell of a view . qUORRA : It used to let us know that Flynn was here . It became the symbol of something bigger , something better than this world .

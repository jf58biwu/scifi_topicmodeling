 [ Vega ] All said and done , it 's gonna come down to a handful of decisions we make out here ... [ Nicky ] Well , who we are has always been defined by what we do . How is this different from any other time ? [ Vega ] Out here , our choices affect not only our lives , but the lives of all the people we 've sworn to protect . We can only hope we make the right ones . [ Mason ] Breaking into " Mission A , " altitude , 8,000 . Atmospheric pressure , zero-point-eight . [ Toni ] That 's our cue , Marines . Gear up . Prep for drop . [ scattered breaths ] Ah--oh , yeah ! Lookin ' good in that armor , Kamille ! You know nothin ' gets me hot like seein ' you go commando . Seriously ... ? Careful , Essex--you 're gonna make your hand jealous . [ Essex ] Heh . No worries , babe . She 's your second biggest fan . And she knows how to party . Heh ... [ Essex cries out in pain ] [ Milque ] And--strike fifty . Well , whatever else happens today , at least we can 't get shot down any worse than that , am I right ? Yo , Nicky . You okay , kid ? Yeah , he 's fine . He 's just ready for some action . Aren 't ya ? You seen any sign of that tactical package yet ? Still waiting on it . Our omnis are synched and linked but there 's nothing in the way of mission specs so far . Makes me uneasy . Does Command usually wait for the last possible minute to tell us who the enemy is , sir ? Seems weird . Ya gotta be ready for anything . Like Commander Shephard always said , nothing is ever simple . Damn , Vega , sucks for you that Shepard 's dead ... You two would have made a really cute couple . [ Essex makes kissing noises ] [ Milque and Kamille laugh ] You think I 'm ashamed to show respect for someone who saved billions of lives ? I 'm proud to follow that example . Laugh it up all you want , pretty boy . I know who my heroes are . Okay , someone 's a little defensive ... Whatever , man . You want a hero to worship , I 'm right here , baby . [ Toni ] That so ? [ Vega ] Attention ! Let 's get this straight . What I see here is a squad ... of highly trained special forces . But you 're not warriors , not yet . Today we find out what you 're made of , Marines . It 's time to earn that uniform . Our final Mission specs are in from Command . I 'm syncing to your omnis now . Take a good look . [ Toni ] Let that sink in ... This is what you 're up against ... Think tough . Think built like a brick shithouse . That 's right , virgins . Your first dance goes to the Krogan Blood Pack , the meanest bunch of reptilian uglies in the Terminus . Krogan are like walking tanks ; they 've got thick , armored skin , two sets of vital organs- - Relax , Nicky ; just aim for the head . [ Toni ] The bastards are currently laying siege to our colony on Fehl Prime ... It so happens to be one of our top pharma processing facilities ... Meds we pull outta this rock cure our sick kiddies across the galaxy . Lot of civilians down there ... Sitrep shows the Blood Pack just outside the perimeter , hammering the colony K-barriers . They get in , we 'll be scraping up colonists for a week ... So--we hit ' em fast , we hit ' em hard ; shuttles strafe their lines . Then we insert ourselves between the enemy and their objective , and vigorously negotiate their defeat . It won 't be easy ; things are getting messy down there . But that 's why they called us ... We 're Alliance Marines , people ! This is what we do ! Any questions ? Then who 's ready to go kick some krogan ass ? ! Sir ! Alliance Marines are , sir ! Hoo-rah ! [ Brood sneers , laughs ] [ Treeya ] Christine , what should we do ? The Alliance Marines are coming ! Just hold on ! [ Brood growls , grunts ] [ guards scream ] [ Guard A ] The Barrier 's down ! [ Christine shudders ] [ Christine gasps ] [ Christine cries ] [ Treeya ] Christine ! [ Christine ] I 'm okay . - -Dammit ! - -You 're not a soldier ; stop taking chances . No , we 've got to hold them off ... Just a little longer ! Brood ! Well done ; you have earned your place as my second . - -Sir . - - [ Archuk ] Now ... unleash the vorcha . [ Brood laughs ] [ various growls and snarls ] [ varren roars ] [ scattered gasps ] [ Guard B ] They 're animals ... - - [ Guard C cries out ] - - [ Guard D ] Shit ! [ Guard E cries out ] [ Brood chuckles ] [ Brood ] An ... air strike ... ? No ! [ krogan grunts ] [ Guard F ] Alliance drop ships ! We 're saved ! [ guards cheer ] [ Christine sighs ] They made it . [ Treeya ] And not a moment too soon . [ Mason ] Get off our lawn , ya dirty space turtles ! [ Toni ] Put us down , Mason . Roger that , Cap . Now prepping for quick dump . Fifteen seconds . [ Toni ] On your feet , Marines ! " A " Squad , aft hatch ! " B " squad , fore hatch ! [ Mason ] Dust off in 5 ... 4 ... Shit ! [ Gamma Pilot ] Abort ! Abort ! Alpha and Beta are down ! Repeat : Alpha and Beta are down ! [ Mason ] Roger , Gamma--abort confirmed . Evasive maneuvers ! Dammit . [ Mason ] Breaking off to re-engage ! [ Brood growls ] [ scattered yells ] [ Vega pants ] Goin ' down ... ! Brace for impact ! Now ! Send the humans to their gods ! [ varren roars ] [ scattered grunts ] [ Marine Z pants , grunts ] [ Marine Z screams , cries out ] [ Treeya ] What 's happening out there ? [ Christine gasps ] [ Treeya exhales ] [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega groans ] [ scattered groans and grunts ] [ Milque coughs ] [ Milque ] Our pilot is so fired ... [ Mason coughs ] Yeah ? Well , I got one better for ya ... I quit . [ Toni ] Move Marines ! Evac this bucket ! [ Toni grunts ] Whoa , Captain , that looks bad ... I said move ! That 's an order ! [ Toni grunts ] [ Essex ] You heard him ! On me ! [ scattered grunts ] You too , Vega ! Better bite down , sir . [ Toni makes muffled grunts ] [ Vega ] On three ... [ Toni screams ] [ Brood grunts ] [ Vega pants , grunts ] [ Vega yells ] [ Brood ] Go ! Search for survivors ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega pants ] Move ! [ Essex yells ] [ Milque ] Come on , Vega ! You can make it ! [ Mason cries out ] [ Nicky ] Sir ! Incoming ! [ Kamille ] Can anyone see them ? ! - - [ Mason ] We are so screwed ! - - [ Kamille ] How many are there ? ! - - [ Essex ] We can 't hold them off for long ! - - [ Nicky ] What do we do ? Sir ! What do we do ? ! [ Vega ] Hold your fire ! Cease fire ! Essex ! Kamille ! [ Kamille ] What the hell , Vega ? ! You guys are just burnin ' Thermal Clips at this range . Save it for when it counts . [ Mason moans ] You gonna live there , flyboy ? I told you ... I quit that job ... [ Vega ] That 's a " yes . " On your feet . [ Mason grunts ] [ Archuk ] Hold your fire ! [ scattered groans ] Alliance ! Show yourselves and be granted an honorable execution ! Wow ... Some negotiator . Milque , I need you to give Nicky your power cells . See what you can do about upgrading my K-barriers . Okay ... That 's great for you , but now what am I supposed to use for shields ? Shields ? You still got a big rock to hide behind , don 'tcha ? Flyboy , look after the captain . Right . Already on it , boss . Listen ... You 've got to get up top and keep their snipers off me . Nicky , you 'll radio me tactical ? That 's a big affirmative , sir . And what the hell are you gonna do ? A krogan never turns down a chance for glory on the battlefield . So I 'm gonna go out there and give them what they want , which should buy the two of you enough time to move around and flank them . [ Kamille and Essex exhale ] [ Essex ] Hold on ... I 'm not running into that firing squad ! No ... we circle all the way around their line and come in behind them ... It 's crazy , but it could work . We 're gonna have to make it work , or we all die ... That is , unless you got a better plan , Essex ? Hey , why 're you askin ' me ? You 're squad leader , at least for another two minutes , anyway ... [ Milque grunts ] [ Archuk laughs ] [ Archuk grunts ] Here they come . [ Vega pants , grunts ] Nicky ! Where 's my tactical ? It 's coming in now , sir . They 're clustered at your 1 2 , forty meters and holding position . I show one sniper already zeroed in on you . [ Milque ] Roger that . I got ' em . [ Vega ] Not yet . Hold your fire till Essex and Kamille engage . Wait . [ Sniper grunts ] [ Archuk grunts ] It seems this one has accepted my offer . [ Vega grunts ] Okay ... Let 's dance . [ Vega grunts ] Come on ... [ Vega pants ] [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega yells ] [ Archuk roars ] Flanking team , where the hell are you ? Talk to me ! [ Kamille ] Almost there . One hundred meters . [ krogan yells ] Here ... Catch . I won 't be needing it . [ Essex gasps ] [ scattered murmurs ] Heh , well , so much for lookin ' cool before I die ... [ Krogan Y ] There ! On the ridge ! Idiot . [ Essex ] You know you love me ! [ vorcha gasp ] [ Kamille winces ] [ Essex ] Hey ! That 's no way to treat a lady ! [ Brood groans ] [ Brood grunts ] [ Brood winces , grunts ] [ Milque cries out , coughs ] Last grenade ... Gotta make it count ! [ Vega grunts ] Dammit ! [ Vega pants , grunts ] [ Archuk yells ] [ Vega grunts , yells ] [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega winces ] [ Archuk ] You are brave , human . Die with honor . [ Archuk screams ] [ Archuk snarls ] Brood ! Find the one controlling the drone and kill them ! [ Brood ] There . I have you now ... [ Nicky grunts , gasps ] [ Archuk sneers ] [ Vega yells ] [ Archuk roars ] [ Archuk grunts ] [ Vega gasps ] [ Archuk roars , Vega grunts ] [ Archuk and Vega grunt ] [ Vega groans ] [ Archuk grunts ] [ Archuk laughs ] Now you die . You first . [ gun clicks ] [ Archuk laughs ] [ Vega gasps ] [ Archuk moans ] [ Archuk ] I like you ... A fighter to the bitter end ! [ Milque pants ] [ Milque ] You alright , Vega ? [ Vega ] Yeah . Think so . [ Milque ] Good ... cause once we get outta this the next drink 's on you . [ vorcha yells ] [ Kamille pants ] [ Essex ] Ha ! It 's almost too easy ! [ Essex grunts ] And that , ladies and gentlemen ... is free drinks for life . [ Essex sighs ] I think I pretty much drained my power cell ... Yeah , maybe one more good shot if I 'm lucky ... [ varren snarls , Essex gasps ] [ Kamille grunts ] Shit ! Kamille ! [ Essex grunts ] [ Essex shudders ] [ Brood and Essex grunt ] Milque ! [ Milque ] I don 't have a shot ! Shit ! [ Brood grunts ] Now ... say goodbye . [ sound of gunshot ] [ Brood groans ] [ Vega pants ] [ Essex ] Whoa ... [ Milque exhales ] See ? We make a pretty good team ! [ Kamille snarls ] Look , the dog thing was an accident , okay ? Yeah , and so was this ! Asshole ... [ Essex groans ] Sorry ! Hot damn ... [ Brood grunts ] [ Essex chuckles ] Hello ... Get on with it ! [ Essex ] Gladly . [ Vega ] Essex ! Stand down , Marine ! We are not murderers ! This is war , man ! - -Yes ! - - [ Brood groans ] You 're right ! This is war ! And now , this krogan is a prisoner of war . You two gonna kiss or what ? Nicely done , squad leader . [ Essex grunts ] That 's the last of ' em ; we did it , sir . That was insane , goin ' out there as bait , y 'know ... I thought for sure you were gonna get us all killed ... But hey ... I guess I gotta be wrong sometime , right ? [ Kamille ] I think what he means is ... We owe you one ... Big time . It 's " Vega , " yeah ? Tell you what ... Vega here deserves a goddamn medal . Not to brag , but technically , I took out more of ' em than he did . " Technically , " you almost took me out , too ! You 're still in the dog house . [ Vega ] It was a team effort , guys . Look , will you drop it already ? I said I was sorry . [ laughter ] Vega ... Hell of a battle there , son ; that 's the kind of leadership I 'd expect from a veteran . It was the training , sir . Don 't sell us that crap ! I never taught you that kind of soldiering and you know it . Quit playin ' coy and accept the compliment ; you earned it . Your courage under fire saved a lot of good people , Vega . And it 's for their continued safety we 'd like you and your squad to stick around ... Hold down the fort . Admiral , the Blood Pack is finished here ... All due respect , but we 're a special forces unit . Can 't you just assign a standard security detail ? I 'm giving you an order , soldier . The Fehl Prime facility and all of its inhabitants are a very valuable resource for the Alliance . It is far too important for us to leave undefended . Are we clear ? Yes , sir , we 're clear . [ Hackett ] I see from your badge you remember the Normandy . I try to , sir ; I think everyone should . It 's good to have heroes , Vega , but don 't be too eager to follow in Shepard 's footsteps . That kind of greatness only comes at a great cost ... Remember that . Hackett out . [ Toni ] Well , Lieutenant ... Welcome to the Terminus Systems ... [ Messner ] All right , it 's all yours ... Let 's get this baby unloaded ! [ dock tech ] We 're clear ! [ Kamille ] Three meters ... Two ... One ... And we 're docked ... Hold it there , Vega . [ Vega ] Copy that , Kamille . Standing by . [ Mason ] Explain something to me . First the cannon , now full-on military-grade barriers ? Seem like overkill to anybody else ? I mean ... we haven 't seen a hostile in , what , two years ? And they got us tricked out to take on a whole fleet . [ Nicky ] You 're clear to retract the cables , sir . [ Vega ] Nicky . We 've been over this . You don 't have to keep calling me sir . [ Milque ] Heh . Kiss ass . Would you just do your job ? [ Milque ] Callin ' ' em like I see ' em . Don 't hate the messenger . [ Essex sighs ] Just wasting ' their time ... My gun already packs all the firepower this place needs . Oh , please , I 've seen your " gun , " Essex ... Hate to be the one to break it to you , but ... not that big . I 'm guessin ' we 've all heard the rumors at this point . Ah- - ! What ? ! [ Nicky ] He means the ones about entire colony populations disappearing without a trace . Yeah , I 've tried asking ' around division about that , but no one wants to talk . Official word from Command is " no comment . " Duh , what 'd you expect ... ? Command doesn 't talk to grunts like us- - you gotta read between the lines . " Here , have a big gun and shut up . " That 's their comment ... Probably all some Cerberus conspiracy they 're trying to keep under wraps . [ Vega ] I dunno--this one doesn 't smell like Cerberus to me . It 's not their style . [ Tech 1 ] Yo , Vega ! Last of the Agri-Dome 's Special Brew ... On the house , buddy ! Well , I can never say no to a free drink ! Then I recommend you plan on staying drunk , 'cause we still owe you plenty . Nice work on the new defenses , by the way . Ah ... It 's what we do . Hola , James ! Hey , April ! Hola , chispita . - -Whatcha doin ' ? - -Waiting for you ! You ready for duty ? Attention ! Yes , sir , Lieutenant ! Okay , then you 'll need this ... Welcome to Delta Squadron , Private . April , Vega 's working . Sorry . Nah , it 's no problem , Christine . Hey , Treeya . Uh , I mean ... Hi . Lieutenant . [ April ] Why you always gotta stare at her like that ? [ April grunts ] I 'm not staring--and soldiers don 't pout . Come here . I need a new lookout . Whaddaya say , huh ? Only if you teach me how to shoot that . [ Vega ] Well ... I don 't think your mom would like that too much ... No , Mommy says it 's a good thing ! She says you 're gonna use it to protect us if the bad guys come back ! Is that true ? Are you gonna ? She 's right ; that 's exactly what I 'll do . And you can help me by stayin' on the lookout , Private . Yes , sir , Lieutenant James ! Hoo-rah ! [ April laughs ] You sure have a way with that one , Vega . I 'd swear she was your little sister . Ew , gross ! We 're married . Okay , " Marine , " I think you 've pestered Vega enough for one day . [ Vega ] Okay , off you go . There ... Thanks , Vega . 'Kay ! Over and out , sir . [ Vega ] You be good . - - [ Tech 2 ] Later days . - - [ Tech 1 ] See you , Vega . Surely this can 't be right ... [ Vega sighs ] [ Mason ] You 're killing us , chief . Better make a move while the gettin 's good . Unless you 're cool with me cutting in on your action . Look , I 've already tried talking to her ... She just doesn 't seem all that interested , you know ? If blushing and sighing 's your idea of talk , man , then we really need to work on your delivery . [ Vega gasps ] April 's badge ! [ Essex ] Seriously . I don 't get it . What 's he see in her , anyway ? You kidding me ? You got eyes , don 'tcha ? Everybody 's crazy for some blue . [ laughter ] [ Vega ] Hm ? [ Vega sighs ] Whoa ... Just in the nick of time , right ? Hey , you 're Vega , aren 't ya ? Saw ya on the vids ... Hope you don 't mind me saying it , but you really gave those Blood Pack sons of bitches what-for a couple of years back ... Made me proud to be a human . And you are ... ? Right , where 's my manners ? Name 's Messner , private importer . I run goods all over the Terminus--vehicles , consumables , the usual boring stuff ... It pays the bills . [ Messner ] Ah , a hero and a gentleman ! [ Messner laughs ] Must be nice havin ' him around . Some would say . Hey , wait a second ... What 's that supposed to mean ? [ Messner ] So , uh ... this is new ... You mind ringing up the powers that be and gettin ' this bad boy open ? [ Vega ] Hey , Whitman ... You gonna make me say " pretty please " or what ? C 'mon , man , let us in . Afraid I can 't , Vega . I 'm sorry . We 've upped security for classified ops and you 're not cleared for entry . You either , Doc . There are materials in the research department that belong to me ! You cannot just lock me out ! I know , but it 's not my call . You can lodge a complaint with Command if you want , but it 's not gonna get you in here any quicker . I 'm sorry . [ Treeya sighs ] Typical ... [ Vega ] Hey ! I 'll get your stuff back ! Let go of my arm ... Sad to say , this is the sort of idiocy I 've had to deal with since you Alliance grunts took over our research post . Like you even care . Cut ' em some slack , huh ? I 'm sure the Alliance has a good reason for locking down your lab . That they declined to share with their own security detail ? Spare me . Roger that ... It 's Captain Toni . He wants to see us ASAP . I can help you with your work , Treeya , just- - Really ? So suddenly you 're an archaeologist ? You don 't know anything about it . Why , ' cause I 'm a grunt ? Try me . Vega ! The boys in Control are picking up some kind of anomalous signal out of Sector Nine , near the old ruins . I knew that something seemed off ... Whatever it is out there , Doctor , it 's playing hell with our long-range communications . Might be one of your relics . Might not be . Either way , I need it gone . Understood , Captain . We 'll take care of it . I want you all combat-ready , in case there are any hostiles who wanna get cute ... And last bit of bad news , our APC is down for a suspension overhaul , so it looks like you 'll have to double-time it out there on foot . [ Messner clears his throat ] Had a Volus pay me in trade a while back with a used Mako . What say we give it a test-drive ? Treeya , you and Messner are with Milque back there . Mason , you be ready to back us up with the Mako . Roger that . Let 's go , Delta Squad ! Cut south and flank the signal point . [ Essex grunts affirmatively ] Nicky , find a good spot for Milque to set up his sniper rifle . Scanning the area . - -Hill looks good . - -Hill looks good ... - -Smart-ass . - -I just said that . - -Hill it is ! - -Hill it is ! Nicky ... you 're with me ... We 're going up the middle for a closer look . Yes , sir ! [ Vega ] What 've you got for me ? [ Nicky ] I don 't know what it is , but Captain Toni wasn 't kidding about the interference ! [ Vega ] Bounce your scan over to the doctor 's omni-tool . [ Nicky ] On it . [ Vega ] Is this one of your relics , Treeya ? I can 't make it out very clearly in the image but the object is not native to this system , I 'm sure of that much . Never seen anything like it before . Didn 't fall out of the sky , either . That crater 's too small for a re-entry impact . But hey , look on the bright side- - at least it 's not taking potshots at us . Wherever it came from , it 's emitting a powerful wide-frequency burst ; no question it 's what 's jamming our communications . I think it 's done enough jamming for one day . [ Essex ] Boom time ? No ! You can 't just destroy an artifact because you don 't understand it ! Stop ! - - [ Treeya gasps ] - -Whoa , hold it there , Doc . [ Treeya breathes ] [ Milque ] That last step 's a doozy . [ Treeya gasps ] [ Treeya shudders ] [ Milque chuckles ] Graceful . Sorry , Treeya , but this isn 't an archaeology expedition . Command sent us here with orders to take out a potential threat , not study history . [ Milque ] One more step and she would 've been history . [ Vega grunts ] What was that , Milque ? [ Treeya ] Nothing ! It 's nothing ... The Mako 's the other way . Where are you going ? I can still figure out where it came from . I 've never seen anyplace like this . Brutes like you could never hope to appreciate it . Just don 't touch anything . [ Mason ] Wow ... Still running after , what ... five thousand years or something ? [ Treeya ] Five ? That 's nothing . More like seventy thousand , at the very least . Seventy thousand ? ! - - [ Messner whistles ] - - [ Treeya ] That shouldn 't surprise you . After all , the Protheans are long gone , but the mass relays they built are still the cornerstone of intergalactic travel . [ Nicky ] True enough , but flying into a relay is a pretty simple task ... What you 're doing ... is actively interacting with this device ! [ Treeya ] Just think of it ... Civilization as we know it depends entirely on the mass effect fields created by the exposure of Element Zero to electrical current . Transportation ... Communication ... Even those weapons of which you 're so fond . [ Messner ] It is handy , I 'll give ya that ... [ Vega ] So what went wrong ? If these Protheans were so powerful , what happened to them ? Fifty thousand years ago , they simply vanished ... For better or worse , Lieutenant ... that question 's become my life 's work ... My mentor Liara T 'Soni 's made great strides towards solving it--maybe she can help . Dr. Nuwani . It 's good to see you . You as well , Dr. T 'Soni . I found an unknown object in the ruins on Fehl Prime and wanted to get your input . [ Messner ] Is it my imagination , or do they all look alike ? [ Liara ] Hmm ... Well , it 's not Prothean , I can tell you that ... In fact , it doesn 't match anything I 've ever seen . Based on the cursory inspection I 've given it so far , these are some very advanced bio-mechanics . [ Liara ] This could be Reaper tech . They 're an ancient race of sentient starships who 've marked all other intelligent life for destruction ... Hence their attack on the Citadel . [ Messner ] Uh , hold up--that ship went for the Alliance 's jugular because it wanted to ? Don 't tell me you believe that ! With all due respect , Dr. T 'Soni , that ship was nothing more than a dreadnaught piloted by a rogue Spectre agent . I saw it , Treeya . I heard it speak . What 's more , I am sure that the Reapers are responsible for the Prothean disappearance fifty thousand years ago . And now after the information- - [ Treeya ] Dr. T 'Soni ? Nicky . Find that signal . So talking starships ate your space mechanics ... You buy any of that ? I wouldn 't wait on that signal ... It 's long gone . I respect Dr. T 'Soni and her contributions to the field , but the fact remains that none of the major civilizations have any record of the Reapers ' existence . The truth is , she 's become obsessed with them- - to the detriment of her career and her professional reputation . She has been regarded as little more than a ... conspiracy theorist ever since she ran off with your Commander Shepard . Hold on ! You mean she actually knew Shepard personally ? ! Hey ! Careful ! Finally , they got something to talk about ... Way to go . [ Vega groans ] [ Toni ] Delta Squadron ! Come in , over ! Say again ? It 's no good . We 're getting that interference again . Except ... [ Vega ] Except what ? [ Nicky shudders ] Back to the colony ! Now ! [ scattered hushed dialogue ] [ colonists gasp ] [ screams from crowd ] [ men scream ] Move it , people ! [ Toni grunts ] Go ! Everyone , get to the vault ! [ Toni grunts , gasps ] [ scattered yells and shrieks ] [ various indistinct shouts and yells ] [ Whitman ] I 'm sorry , I have my orders ! I can 't let you in without proper authorization ! [ colonist ] So you 're just gonna let us die out here ? Well , I say ... screw that ! [ indistinct dialogue from crowd ] [ indistinct yells and screams from crowd ] [ pained yells and screams , sound of gunfire ] [ Milque ] There ... I got multiple targets . [ Nicky ] Whoa--what the heck are those things ? Looks like they 're all carrying weapons ... Great , so I guess we can rule out a social visit ... [ Nicky ] I don 't see any of the colonists ... Oh , shit ... Get down ! [ grunting ] [ Vega ] You ever seen these things before ? No , never ... Though that ship appears to be based on the same technology as the object we found . [ Vega ] Alright--then until we know what 's going on here , we assume they 're hostile . We go in stealth for recon , through the sinkhole , below their sight lines . Clear ? Vega , maybe someone should stay back on lookout ? Someone 's gotta watch the Mako . [ Kamille ] Right--more like someone 's gotta grow a pair . Just sayin ' . [ Essex grunts ] [ Vega ] Come on . Watch your step . [ Vega and Treeya gasp ] [ Essex gasps ] Where 's Vega and Treeya ? [ Kamille ] Still over there . Great , so they can fly ... Suddenly , I 'm missin ' the Blood Pack ... [ Vega sniffs ] Come on . [ Essex ] Man , there 's swarms of ' em up there ... So where do you think all the colonists went ? [ Vega ] Stay here ! [ Vega ] Hey ... Can you hear me ? He 's got a pulse ... It 's like he 's been paralyzed ... What the hell ... ? There 's no visible signs of battle ... [ woman 's voice screams ] [ Vega ] Let 's go ! [ Vega ] Hold up . Okay , we 're close , but we 're about to lose our overhead cover . We 'll be easy to spot if we move as a group . All of you stay here while I check it out . [ Vega grunts ] I 'm coming with you ! Wait ! Treeya ! Vega ... Cállate . [ Treeya exhales ] [ Treeya sighs ] I told you to stay . [ Vega ] Fine . [ April pants intensely ] [ April ] Mommy ! Help ! [ Christine ] April ! We 've gotta keep running , baby ! [ Christine pants , April whimpers ] [ Christine gasps ] [ April shudders ] Mommy ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega ] No ... [ Vega pants ] [ Vega ] Christine ... ? Damn it ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega ] April ? No ... No , no , no , no , no , no ! You gotta hang on for me there , soldier ... I 'll find a way to save you ... Yo prometo ... [ Treeya ] Are they ... ? [ Vega ] No ... Just paralyzed , like the others . They 're coming ... This way ! [ Treeya gasps ] [ Treeya ] What are they doing ? [ Treeya gasps ] [ Vega ] We go out there now , we just get ourselves killed . There 'll be a chance to help them ... But we have got to be smart . [ Vega ] Let 's get back to the squad ... [ Mason ] We saw ' em carrying people off in those pod things . Question is , what for ? [ Essex ] Gotta be for some kinda experiments or somethin ' , ya think ? Yeah , or maybe for food . [ disapproving grunts ] Or maybe not . I don 't give a damn what their reasons are . All I care about now is getting everyone back safely . Let 's save the " why 's " for later and start coming up with a plan of attack . For starters , how ' bout we get ahold of some bigger guns ? Yo , Nicky . Yes , sir . [ Vega ] Check our stores ; see what we 've got that can take on that ship . Well , not to interrupt , but ... is that big cannon just for show ? [ Vega ] Right . Here 's the plan . We make our way to the top of the security tower to activate the turret . But we 'll need a diversion while it 's powering up . Flyboy , you light up the fuel stores to draw ' em away from us , then you run like hell . Got it ? [ Mason ] Shit , I 'm gonna quit for real this time . [ Vega ] The rest of us will move up along the maintenance scaffolds . Milque , I 'm counting on you to watch our backs . [ Milque ] Mm-hmm ... Just once , I wish someone would watch my back for a change ... I can 't even count all these damn things ! [ Vega ] Essex , Kamille--you two stand here and stay guard . Alright , let 's move ! Lead the way , chief . [ sound of footsteps , trailing off ] Hey . What do ya know ? We 're finally alone . Don 't you ever quit ? Now , we can get this thing online , right ? Absolutely . That 's the easy part . Problem 's gonna be waiting for the cannon to fully charge . It 's probably a good idea to stay away from the windows right now . [ Treeya ] What 's happening to our people , Lieutenant ? [ Vega ] Hold on ... We can track their omnis to see where they 've been taken . Okay , here it is . Looks likes the hostiles have ' em split into two groups ... [ Treeya ] So they 're being stowed for transport ? But why ? [ Nicky ] Cannon fifty percent charged . [ Vega ] Ahh ... ! This is taking way too long . Any way to speed things up ? [ Nicky ] I 'm doing what I can , sir . [ Messner ] Yeah , well , it 's not enough . The bugs are gonna start heading back this way any second . Can we activate the turret with the charge we 've got ? Well , theoretically , but there 's no way of knowing whether or not it 'll do any damage . Wouldn 't decreased destructive power be ideal in this situation ? We want to minimize the risk to the colonists on board , yes ? Good point . We 'll fire with what 's built up . Looks like they 've got it ready . Sure took ' em long enough . Alright . The turret 's in position . Awaiting your order . Fire ! [ Nicky ] Our shot 's been deflected ! [ Vega ] Son of a ... ! Damn it ! [ Nicky ] Enemy drones en route , sir ! Go ! All of you ! Nicky , stay with Messner ! [ Nicky ] Yes , sir ! [ Vega ] Treeya ... Hey , snap out of it ! Let 's go ! Treeya ! [ Treeya shudders ] [ Vega ] Dios mio ... [ Milque ] Shit , that 's not good ... Aah ! - - [ Milque ] Mason ! - -Yeah , you can thank me later . Now how ' bout we get the hell outta here ? [ Vega grunts , yells ] [ Treeya cries out ] [ Vega braces ] [ Vega ] Hang on to me ! [ Vega and Treeya grunt ] We made it ... [ Vega ] Not yet . Come on ... Jump ! [ Essex ] Vega ! [ Kamille ] Vega ! Treeya ! Over here ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Essex ] Almost there ! You got it ! [ Kamille ] You better get her inside . [ Essex grunts ] I 'm out ! [ Essex ] Guns are no good against these swarms anyway ! Get below with the others ! [ Kamille ] Gah ! [ Kamille struggles , screams ] Kamille ! [ Vega ] What 's the hold-up , Nicky ? ! Get the door closed ! Almost there ! [ Vega ] Hurry ! [ Vega growls ] [ Essex ] Son of a bitch--they just keep coming ! [ Milque ] Comin ' through ! I 'll be damned ... [ Mason exhales ] [ Mason ] I think that oughta buy us some time ... [ Vega ] How we doin ' on the door , Nicky ? All over it , sir ... I 'm sealing it up now . [ Vega ] Everybody , inside ! Where the hell 's Kammy ? [ Essex sighs ] I 'm sorry , man . They got her . [ Mason gasps ] What ? ! How ? ! I thought you were supposed to have her back ! [ Essex ] Oh , shit ! [ Mason grunts ] [ Essex and Mason yell ] [ Vega ] What 's going on ? Little ones , crawling through the gaps ! They 're inside ! Just go , Mason ! Move it ! Guns don 't work on these little bastards ! I 'll have to use my biotics to hold ' em back ! [ Nicky ] Door 's closing , people ! Stand clear of the hatch ! Come on , you two , stop screwing ' around ! [ Mason grunts ] [ Mason ] Essex , you dumbass ! Get in here ! You 're steppin ' all over my big moment ! C 'mon , man ... Just trying to look cool before I die ... [ Vega and Milque pant ] Alliance Command , this is Fehl Prime ... The colony is under attack ... Repeat , the colony is under attack ... Alliance Command , do you co- - [ Vega ] How 's Essex ? [ Milque ] He got stung , but , he 's alive ... It 's only a matter of time before they figure out where we are . I 'm with the doc . We 're sittin ' ducks in this place . Here ... I say we get to the shuttle and break for orbit . Now you 're talking . We can send out a distress call to Alliance once we 're clear of the jamming signal . Uh , sir . Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? [ gasps ] [ Mason ] Son of a bitch ... You 're kidding me , right ? [ Messner sighs ] You should have waited , Lieutenant . [ Mason exhales lightly ] " Should have waited " ? For what ? [ Treeya moans ] [ Messner ] The cannon was only at half power when he fired on their ship . [ Mason ] That true ? Our only shot , and you blew it ? It was my fault . I made the call ... I was just trying to minimize any collateral damage . " Collateral damage " ? ! What the hell you call all this , man ? ! We lost Kamille out there ! I know ! But I haven 't given up on Kamille yet--or any of our people ! We fight smart , we fight together , and we will get them back ! Who 's with me ? ! I am , sir ... We 're Marines , it 's what we do . Now , if Essex is still alive out there , then I 'm goin ' out to get him . I 'll help . [ Vega ] How 's he holding up , Nicky ? [ Nicky ] There 's been no trauma to his circulatory or respiratory systems ... [ Treeya ] And no sign of neurological impairment . [ Nicky ] He just can 't move . We 'll get you back on your feet , Essex . You just hang in there . Not like he 's got a choice ... [ Nicky ] Entire colonies vanishing overnight ... I thought it was just a silly rumor ... but now ... [ Treeya ] The Alliance must not have known what sort of foe they were up against ... I mean , they certainly didn 't prepare any of us for this contingency . They lacked the proper intel ... It looks as though they did know about the bugs and their paralytic sting , but I 'm not seeing anything on file about those humanoid raiders or their ship . Wait ... There 's a note at the bottom of this report ... Something about work having been done on a potential antidote ... ? Good catch ... Keep poking around ... If they perfected a cure , I want to track it down and stick Essex with it ASAP . - - [ Nicky ] Vega ! - -What 'd you find ? [ Nicky ] A file on our new friend . He 's one of the reasons security 's been beefed up around here . According to the Alliance , Messner 's been spying on us and reporting back to his employer ... AKA Cerberus . - - [ Vega ] What ? ! - - [ Messner ] Well , this is awkward . [ Treeya ] Wait , what is Cerberus ? [ Vega ] A bunch of damn human supremacists ! [ Messner scoffs ] Says you ... [ Vega growls ] Pendejo ! [ Messner ] Temper , temper ... ! They think humans should be top dog in the galaxy , and do whatever it takes to make that happen , no matter who gets caught in the crossfire ! [ Messner ] You get that from a leaflet , Vega ... ? Hey , I know our bosses don 't see eye-to-eye , but we 're on the same team for a change . Cerberus was trying to cook up an antidote , too ... They wanted me to figure out the abductions ... Think of all the people we can save with this info ! [ Vega ] We still don 't know who these bastards are . [ Messner grunts ] Cerberus knows ... Knowing stuff is kind of our thing . We 've taken to calling ' em ... Collectors . [ Mason ] Bullshit . Hey , we 're a group with a profound distrust of alien species . We keep tabs on all of ' em , even the mythical ones ... In stories , they show up , " collect " some unwitting species , and take it back home , beyond some distant mass relay . [ Vega ] Yeah ? What for ? [ Messner ] Your guess is as good as mine ... They don 't leave a forwarding address , and it 's a one-way trip for whatever they grab ... That 's everything Cerberus knows about ' em , honest . [ Treeya ] I very much doubt that . Hey ... come on ... I can 't help but wonder if these " Collectors " had anything to do with the mass disappearance of the Protheans . [ repetitive , echoing thud ] [ Milque ] What was that ? ! [ Messner ] I didn 't do it . [ Vega exhales ] It 's coming from downstairs ! [ Brood grunts ] I remember you ... The Alliance marines who bested the Blood Pack , and their battlemaster , Vega . Thought they shipped you off to the Citadel months ago to stand trial . They didn 't have the quad . So they kept me here as a test subject . Figured it was safer than transporting me . I know the score , human . You 're outnumbered and outgunned , but I can get you off this rock . All you have to do is open the cage . [ Milque ] Keep on dreaming , ugly . You 're still a Blood Pack mercenary . I think we 'll take our chances with the bugs . [ Mason huffs ] [ Brood ] Mmm ... [ Treeya ] Vega ? Are you alright ? [ Vega ] Christine and April ... They counted on me to protect them . Do you think I made the wrong decision back there , Treeya ? I think you did what any good leader would do ... There was no " right " choice , so you made what you thought was the " best " choice . If I were Commander Shepard , I would have found a way to save all those people . Well , you 're not Shepard ; you 're James Vega . You know , it 's funny--Admiral Hackett gave me some similar advice once ... I know how hard you try to protect everyone ... Sometimes , circumstances make that impossible ... You can 't blame yourself , James . Vega ! Doc ! I think I found something you 're gonna want to see ... ! [ Nicky ] I 've been looking through these science files like you told me to , and I tracked down the latest version of the antidote . It tested at a success rate of 69 % . How many humans have they tried this stuff out on , Nicky ? Essex would be the first . [ Vega sighs ] Guess we don 't have much of a choice ... [ Treeya ] This is the one , Vega . How do we know it won 't kill him ? We don 't ... But Essex is a stubborn bastard . Do it , Treeya . [ Treeya ] Administering antidote . [ Nicky sighs ] Metabolic-stasis ... [ Vega ] English , Nicky . [ Nicky ] It 's not working . [ Vega sighs ] [ repetitive , echoing thud ] [ gasps ] That krogan doesn 't know when to give up . [ Vega growls ] Vega ... We got company ... It 's for you . [ booming thud ] [ Vega grunts lightly ] So what is it ? [ Milque ] Nothing friendly , that 's for sure . Here they come . [ Mason grunts ] [ electronic zipping noise ] [ Mason gasps ] [ Mason ] Kamille ... ? That you ? Kammy ? ! Wait ! Mason ! [ Mason pants , laughs ] [ Milque ] Mason ! [ Milque ] Shit ! What the hell is that thing ? ! [ Vega ] Fall back ! Nicky , find us a way outta here ! [ Milque ] That armor 's too damn thick ! [ nicky ] All clear ... ! This way ! Treeya ... ! [ Treeya pants ] What about him ... ? [ creature roars ] [ Vega ] No time ! [ Treeya and Vega pant ] [ Nicky ] I 'm locking down the security doors behind us . It should buy us a minute ! [ Vega ] Nice work , Nicky ! [ panting continues ] [ Vega ] Hey , hold up ! What 's wrong , sir ... ? The exit is this way ! [ Vega ] We 're taking a quick detour ... Follow me ! [ Vega ] You said you can get us off this planet . You ready to make good ? I had a ship hidden nearby ; as far as I know , it 's still there . [ Treeya ] He 's lying ! We can 't trust him ... [ Vega ] We have to trust him , Treeya ... We 've got nothing to lose ; if he can 't help us , everyone dies , him too . Heh . You spared my life two years ago , Vega . I repay my debts . Now ... let 's hurry . [ Nicky ] All clear ! [ Brood ] This way ! [ Brood roars ] [ Brood ] Get in . [ Brood ] Now ... where to ? [ Vega ] Anywhere ... Just get us outta here ! What 's going on ? [ Brood ] Hard to say ... Friends of yours ? [ Vega growls ] [ Vega ] Keep it off us ! Hit it with everything you 've got ! Ahh ! [ Milque ] Any better ideas , chief ? ! [ Vega ] Don 't stop ! Keep firing ! [ grunts ] [ Milque ] How many arms does this thing got ? ! Vega ! [ Nicky ] Augh ! [ Vega ] Nicky ! [ Vega gasps ] [ Essex ] Ha , ha , ha ! [ Essex roars ] What the hell ... ? Hey , it 's Essex ! [ Essex yells , grunts ] [ Vega ] Outta the way ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega groans ] [ Vega growls ] Chew on this ! [ Vega pants ] Heads up , Vega ... ! I 'm comin ' ! [ Essex ] Got 'cha ! [ creature shrieks ] [ Nicky shudders ] [ Vega ] Nicky ! How bad is it ? That depends , sir ... Does ... anyone else see Essex ? It 's really me , kid ... Still in the flesh , thanks to you ... Your antidote worked . We did it , Doc . You did real good , Nicky ... Now , you hold on , Marine . I 'm ... with you , sir ... We 've still gotta ... save our people ... [ Nicky exhales weakly ] [ Vega sighs ] No ... [ Messner ] That 's a damn shame ... So ... what do we do now ? We 'll be lucky to get off the ground in this bucket ... Oh , she 'll get off the ground--I guarantee that ! I just won 't promise how far she 'll go ... Then how ' bout the old ruins ; can we make it at least that far ? It 's gotta be better than here . What 's the difference ? They 'll shoot us down the second we 're airborne . [ Messner ] Any way you slice it , our odds are long . Collectors don 't make a habit of leaving witnesses . Do you have any weapons ? Hmph ! What kind of a question is that ? You 're speaking to a krogan . [ Brood ] We live for weapons . [ Vega ] Our only real option now is to complete our initial objective ... We have to disable the Collector ship 's engines ... But we 'll have to do it from the inside . What ? That 's suicide ! The creepy eye thing 'll open up before we get close ! We 'd be ... well ... evaporated . That 's just about the gist of it . [ Messner ] Hell , even factoring out the eye , we 'd never break through their shields . Why not fly directly into the eye ? Take the fight to them and punch through where they least expect it . What ... ? It 's an idea . As crazy as that sounds ... I think you might actually be on to something there . Way I see it , we can take a chance ... or we can choke to death in this pit ... Good marines laid down their lives for the people trapped up there , and I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna let their sacrifice be for nothing ! If I go out , I 'm going out fighting for their memory ... Anybody here feels the same way , you 're welcome to join me . Essex , you in ? [ Essex ] Hm . [ Essex ] Well , I suppose the fumes these tanks are spewing out would give us some cover ... This swill tastes of varren dung ! My ship 's cannon is still operational ... If we get close enough , we can blast our way inside . Then it 's just a matter of reaching the others ... And once we administer the antidote , maybe then they can join the fight . [ Milque sighs ] Give me that damn thing ... But I 'm still calling this a suicide mission . I 'll need more than a drink to change my mind . Look , Milque ... You 've been right about everything so far ... But you gotta be wrong sometime , and I 'd say you 're about due . Whoa , man ... That 's harsh driving ' ! [ Brood ] We 're in , aren 't we ? [ Messner ] You say that like it 's a good thing . [ Milque ] Look at all of ' em ... I guess we 're the only ones who made it outta the colony ... Lucky , huh ? Yeah , tell that to Kamille and Nicky . What do they want with all these humans , anyway ? Ah , I hate bugs on my windshield . We gotta stop this ship ; head for the drive core ! Let 's try a short cut . Wait--do you even know where you 're going ? ! [ Brood ] No , I just want to smash a few more walls ! Hang on ! [ Vega ] Here ! This is it ! [ Vega ] Essex , Milque--port side ! Let 's go ! [ Essex ] Yeah ... ! Come on ! Who wants some ? ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Essex ] Here ... ! You like that ? ! Payback 's a bitch , huh ? ! [ Milque ] Behind us ! [ Treeya ] Vega ! [ Vega ] Thanks ... Watch it ! Nice shooting ... I think you 're a natural . Thanks . [ Vega ] Brood ! Take out that drive core ! - -On it . - - [ Messner ] Sorry , I can 't let you do that . [ Brood grunts ] Buh-bye ... [ Essex struggles ] Dammit ... ! [ Messner ] Woo ! Rise and shine , Doc ! This is the moment you don 't want to miss ! From the sound of things , your colony 's just been reduced to a pile of ashes . [ Messner ] You made quite a mess down there , and Collectors aren 't too big on evidence . But hey , you fought the good fight--right , Doc ? These guys usually don 't face much resistance . Don 't beat yourself up . You 've been working for them ... How could you do this ? [ Messner ] I 've saved more than I 've sacrificed , Doctor . If you weren 't so hung up on petty details , you 'd realize that . [ Treeya ] How dare you ... ? ! Those are innocent lives you destroyed , Messner ! They were your own people ! Look , everything I 've done has been in pursuit of Cerberus goals ... After we figured out the Collectors were the ones making off with the colonists , I got in touch , I lured them out with a colony that would be easy pickings , and voila . [ Treeya ] That artifact among the ruins ... The one that jammed our long-range communications ... You put that there ! You were summoning them ! But to what end ? What was Cerberus thinking ? ! [ Messner ] Frankly , that we might learn something--and we have . Guilt-trip me all you want , I 've gathered data on their ships and weapons , ascertained their strengths and weaknesses- - hell , I even know about their home base , out beyond Omega Four relay ... Just think of all the knowledge ! Don 't tell me that doesn 't excite you ! All it does is sicken me ! None of that is worth the cost ! Gotta wonder , though ... Why are they juicing us ... ? They 're not using that DNA slurry for food , I can tell you that much . Tell you what ... I 'm gonna let you put that brain of yours to use , Doc . I 've got a puzzle that needs solving , and you 're just the asari for the job ... Figure it out fast enough , and you might be able to save some colonists , hm ? And after I do ... What then ? You paralyze me and pack me away ? Hey , I 'm just giving you a chance to do something important with your life ! And as you 're about to find out ... I 'm not asking . [ Treeya struggles ] [ Treeya ] No ! Let go of me ! You won 't get away with this ! Vega ! Vega ! [ Vega snarls , grunts ] [ Vega ] Oye ! Feo ! [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega pants ] [ Vega yells ] [ Vega ] Sweet dreams , asshole . [ unidentified groaning ] [ Vega ] Brood ... ? Brood ! [ Brood struggles ] Vega ... ? [ Vega ] I 'm here . Here ... Take my power cell . You 'll need it ... [ Brood coughs ] And what about you , big man ? I 'm finished . But maybe you can still use it to fight your way out . You freed me from that cage , Vega , and gave me the chance to die with honor in battle , the way a krogan should ... For that ... I owe you a debt I can never repay ... [ Brood exhales ] Vaya con Dios , hermano . [ Essex ] So--no biotics ... no guns ... [ Essex sighs ] All I 've got is my knife and a couple of grenades . Same here . We 're pretty much dead in the water , huh ? Not quite . Brood gave me a power cell for you , Essex ... Better yet ... We 've still got the antidote , too . [ Milque ] Wait--but we never took it . So why didn 't we stay paralyzed like the others ? [ Vega laughs ] C 'mon , man ... Why you think our last drink tasted like shit ? You mean you just spiked it without telling us ? ! Seemed like a pretty smart move at the time . Great ... So what 's our move now ? Free the colonists ... and get the hell out . [ Essex ] Hm . You , uh ... really think it 's going to be that easy ? No , no , but I think we can get the Collectors' processing system to do most of the work . And how we gonna do that ? ! They run the pods through here on this conveyor line , right ? So what do you wanna bet 's on the other end ? The holding area we saw when we flew in ... ! [ Vega ] Right . So I 'll rig the antidote to disperse and send the pod back down the line . You guys get started on the people in here . [ Milque coughs ] Smells even worse than it tastes ! [ Vega ] Here we go ... Pod 's away . Cross your fingers . [ Milque ] Hey , Vega ... So once we wake everyone up ... We 're already off planet ... How do we get off this ship ? [ Vega ] April ... Earth to Vega--you listening , man ? ! [ Vega ] I hear you , Milque . Give me a sec ... I just found April . [ Milque ] Tch ... [ Vega ] Hey , soldier , you 're gonna be alright . Just one more thing I need to do and then I 'll be back . Alright ! Milque ! Essex ! Time to move--let 's go ! We need to get our hands on Messner . This is Prothean technology , right ? Some kind of telepathic data repository ? I don 't know what it 's doing on a Collector ship , but I want to find out . I wouldn 't have dragged you down here except that , well , you see , it doesn 't seem to interact with human minds all that well ... I threw some " volunteers " at it , just to be safe , and it fried their cerebral cortices . But Doc , you 're a whole different breed of guinea pig ... Yeah ... You 'll do it willingly . 'Cause maybe it 'll tell you what happened to your Protheans , and maybe that information helps you save some lives . [ Messner ] C 'mon . You know you wanna . [ Treeya shivers ] [ Treeya gasps ] [ Reaper ] You will submit . [ Reaper ] You will ascend . [ Reaper ] And you will serve . What 'd you see ? ! Liara T 'Soni ... She was right all along about the fate of the Protheans . Fifty thousand years ago , the Reapers wiped them out . Why do the Collectors have this thing ? [ Treeya sighs ] They are the Protheans ... remade by the Reapers to serve them . I need to know why Collectors are taking human colonies ! Ask it yourself ! Once I get this last piece of the puzzle , I 'll know all their secrets ! I will own them ! - -Do it again ! And this time , tell me everything ! - - [ Treeya ] No ! They 're building Reapers ... out of our DNA . Let me get this straight . We swoop in , kick Messner 's ass , grab Treeya , and bolt--that 's the plan ? And one more thing : the intel Messner has on the Collectors will help Alliance Command protect hundreds of colonies- - thousands , maybe millions of lives . We bring it back , whatever it takes . Takin ' a page from Shepard 's book , huh ? Save the girl , save the galaxy , go home heroes . That about right ? Maybe ... But right now , I 'll settle for just getting us all home . I 've done what you asked , now let me go , this instant- - Ah , shut up . [ Messner ] Hah ! It recorded ! Yes ! Now I have everything I need ! [ Treeya ] Take your hands off me ! [ Messner ] I 'm on your side ! [ Essex ] Why aren 't they attacking ? It 's like they 're not even looking for us . [ Milque ] Far as they know , we 're already juiced . Probably never had anyone escape before . [ Essex ] That 'll change in a hurry once the all colonists start waking up . We need to get ' em outta here . Yeah , and I think we might just be in luck . Say , Milque . You 're up . I am ? ! For what ? ! Remind me ... You started in the pilot 's program , right ? Think I remember hearing that once . Yeahhh ... ? And I got kicked out , 'cause I couldn 't fly for shit . What 're y--oh , fuck that ! Guess you 're just gonna have to learn in a hurry , aren 't ya ? Hop on . [ Vega ] We 've still got a fix on Treeya 's omni-tool . That 's where me and Essex are headed . You get this bucket in the air and come pick us up . Got it ? Okay , but don 't complain if I 'm late ! [ Vega ] Just be there . Sure , guys ... but if I actually pull this off , this time , free drinks for life are not even gonna cover it ... [ VI Translator ] Your usefulness has decreased to zero , human . You have allowed Alliance soldiers to threaten our mandate . Hey , without me , those soldiers would 've taken out your drive core . How ' bout a little appreciation ? [ VI Translator ] Negative . It is time for your ascension . [ Messner ] What ... ? No way ! Don 't even try it ! Anything happens to me , this data goes to the Alliance ! [ Messner and Treeya pant ] [ Messner ] I mean it ! I 'll give ' em all your secrets ! [ VI Translator ] Your threats are meaningless , human . You really want to take that chance , do you ? You think you had trouble with a few Marines ? What 're you gonna do when you find the entire fleet parked outside the Omega 4 relay ? Huh ? ! Would that " threaten your mandate " ? ! Now , now , what you say we just be reasonable here ... [ VI Translator ] Incompetence cannot be tolerated . In addition to soldiers , you have allowed this asari aboard our ship . She will taint our human material . Don 't like the blue chick ? Fine ! I 'll throw ' er out for ya ! Don 't touch me , Messner ... [ Treeya struggles ] No ! Let me out ! [ Messner gasps ] You bitch ! Give me that ! [ Messner grunts ] [ Treeya gasps ] [ Vega grunts ] [ Vega ] Treeya ! [ VI Translator ] Eject the asari ! [ Treeya screams ] [ Vega ] Treeya ! No ! Go on , man ; never keep a lady waiting . I 'll take care of these bugs . [ Vega ] Thanks , Essex . You watch yourself , Marine . Hoo-rah ! [ Essex grunts ] [ Essex ] Hngaah ! See ya ! [ Essex ] You 're next , ugly ! [ Treeya ] Vega ! [ Vega growls ] Hang on ! [ Treeya screams ] [ Vega growls ] Nooo ! [ Vega grunts ] So you took the antidote when I wasn 't lookin ' , eh ? [ Vega groans ] I guess you think you 're pretty clever , don 'tcha ... you stupid grunt ? ! [ Messner and Vega grunt ] [ Messner ] How 's that workin ' out for ya ... ? ! [ Vega groans ] [ Messner and Vega pant ] Adios ... [ Vega yells ] [ Messner shudders ] We 're not done . You 've still got something I need . Try not to die before I get back . [ Messner shudders ] Come in ! Treeya ! Treeya , do you copy ? ! [ Treeya ] Yes , Vega . I can hear you . [ Vega ] Any idea where you are ? ! I 've started to descend ... into the atmosphere ... But so has the ship- - you don 't have much time ! [ Vega ] I 'm coming , Treeya ! [ Essex grunts ] [ Essex ] Heads up , asshole ! [ Essex groans ] Still with me , Essex ? ! Aw , hell yeah ! As long as they keep on comin ' , I 'll just keep knockin ' ' em down ! [ Essex gasps ] Essex ! [ Vega roars ] [ Essex gurgles ] [ Essex coughs ] [ Vega growls , grunts ] [ Essex groans ] Collect this ... you bitch ! [ Essex struggles , yells ] [ Vega ] Essex ! Dammit ... [ Vega ] C 'mere ! [ Messner groans ] [ Vega grunts ] Where 's the data ? ! [ Messner shudders ] [ Vega yells ] [ Vega grunts , struggles ] [ Vega yells ] [ Vega roars , grunts ] [ Vega ] It 's about damn time , Milque ! Hey ! Better late than never ! [ indistinct chatter ] Mommy ! We can move again ! That 's right , honey . Now , I need you to be a brave girl for me . We 're gonna be okay . Yeah ! Lieutenant James is gonna save us . He promised ... But where is he ? He 's here ... right ? Don 't worry , he hasn 't forgotten . Vega 'll be back soon , I guarantee it . Yeah , I know that ! But he needs me , I 'm s 'posed to be his lookout ! [ Christine ] April ! [ Toni chuckles ] Brave kid you got there . Come on ! The data ! Where the hell is it ? ! Listen ... I can pay you as much as you want ; just name your price ... Please , Vega ... Help me . You just can 't leave me here like th- - [ Vega ] You made your choice . [ Milque ] Vega ! We got more drones inbound ! Time to go ! Now ! Not yet ! I haven 't found Messner 's data cuff ! [ Treeya ] He doesn 't have it ! What ? Treeya--you have it ? Yes . She 's lying ! Just ... take me with you ! It 's yours ! Anything ! I don 't wanna die ! Not like this ! No ! Nooo- - ! [ Vega grunts ] We 're coming , Treeya ! The Reapers were responsible for the Prothean disappearance . You have to warn the Council . We will ; that intel 's going straight to the Alliance ! We 'll pick up the colonists first , then we 're coming after you ! Milque ! Track her position- - don 't lose her ! And punch it ! Roger that . [ Treeya ] There 's no time , Vega . You 'll have to make a choice ... And the loss of one is better than the alternative ... One life ... in exchange for the lives of so many others ... I know you 'd try to save everyone if you could . But circumstances have made that impossible , I 'm afraid . It 's not your fault . I know you well enough to know you 'll make the best choice ... and I understand . [ Vega ] No ! [ Toni ] Vega ! Come in Vega ! Do you read ? We 're taking fire here , Vega ! We need to evacuate , now ! [ Vega ] Captain . Lieutenant Vega here . I copy . I 'm gonna try to reach you , sir , but ... - - [ Christine ] April ! - - [ April ] Hey , is that James ? ! Lieutenant James , can you hear me ? It 's Private April ! We 're still here ! Mommy and me are waiting for you ! Vega , what do we do , man ? ! [ Vega pants ] [ Treeya ] It 's okay , Vega ... You can do what needs to be done . I know you can . [ Vega and Milque grunt ] [ Vega yells ] [ Treeya gasps , shudders ] We 've analyzed your report , Vega . Now , is there anything else you wish to add to the official record before we make our final determinations ? No , sir . It 's all there . We understand that you found yourself facing a very difficult decision , Lieutenant ... and you chose to rescue a single civilian carrying intel on these " Collectors , " at the cost of hundreds of colonist lives . [ David Anderson ] We don 't envy you that position , son . This intel will not only help us stop the Collectors in the short term ... but in the long term ... it will aid humanity with ship and weapons technology . You also proved the effectiveness of an antidote that will protect our people against the Collector swarms . In short , you 're a hero . And for exemplary service to the Alliance , you 're being commended . Congratulations , Lieutenant Commander Vega . [ Milque laughs ] Congrats ! Your new orders , son . Perhaps you 'll follow in Shepard 's footsteps after all . You might even work together . Sir ... ? Turns out the reports of Shepard 's death were ... well , let 's just say " premature . " So , what 'd they give you ? Thank you ! Let 's see it . Oh , hot damn ! They want you to put in for the N7 program ! You 'll be with the best of the best ! Right up there with Commander Shepard ... just sayin ... y 'know ... [ Vega sighs ] Uh ... Look , I don 't know if this means anything to you ... But I think you 're a hell of a leader , and I 'd still follow you into battle anytime , anywhere , sir . Thanks , but I don 't deserve that . It 's a chance to start over , isn 't it ? To move forward ... To live the hero 's life you 've always wanted ... I don 't know what I want anymore , Treeya ... but I know I 'm no hero . Whoa , this looks even worse than I imagined it would ... [ Vega groans ] [ Vega ] That 's April 's ... [ Vega moans , Treeya gasps ] [ April 's voice ] You 're gonna protect us if the bad guys come back ! Is it true ? Are you gonna ? [ Vega groans , Treeya sobs ] How could we let this ... ? [ Treeya sobs ] [ Vega grunts , pants ] [ Vega pants ] [ Treeya sobs ] [ Vega pants ] Hey ! Watch it ! What 's wrong with you ? ! [ Vega pants ] I 'm sorry ... I 'm sorry ... ! [ Hackett 's voice ] For exemplary service to the Alliance , you 're being commended ... You 're a hero ... - - [ Vega screams ] - - [ Anderson 's voice ] In the long term ... it will aid humanity with ship and weapons technology ... [ Hackett 's voice ] ... proved the effectiveness of an antidote ... [ Milque 's voice ] ... you 're a hell of a leader ... the best of the best ! [ Treeya 's voice ] I know you 'd try to save everyone if you could ... [ April 's voice ] He promised ! [ Christine 's voice ] Close your eyes , baby ! [ unidentified voice screaming ] - - [ April 's voice ] Mommy ! - - [ Treeya 's voice ] I know you 'll make the best choice . [ Tech 's voice ] They 're not comin ' ! [ April 's voice ] We 're still here ! [ Toni 's voice ] We need to evacuate , now ! Vega , what do we do , man ? ! [ Vega and Milque grunt ] [ Vega yells ] What 's happening ? Where 's James ? [ indistinct yelling and dialogue ] They 're not comin ' for us ... are they ? [ Toni ] Vega , it 's now or never , son . [ Vega shudders ] [ unidentified voice ] Look out ! [ scattered yelling and screaming ] [ April ] Mommy ? Hush ... It 's okay , baby ... It 's okay ... Just close your eyes , honey ... we 're going home ... [ yelling and screaming in background ] [ yelling and screaming over radio ] James said he 'd come back ... He said he 'd save us , Mommy . He promised ! [ April sobs ] [ Toni ] God have mercy ... [ Vega screams ] [ Milque gasps ] What did you do , man ? ! [ Vega and Milque grunt , pant ] [ Vega seethes ] Nooo ! [ Vega ] I did this ! I made the choice ! I abandoned them to die !

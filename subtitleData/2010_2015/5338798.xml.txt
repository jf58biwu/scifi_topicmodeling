 How rude of them . That 's what happens you spend 6 days a week working in mines and ... still burst start to think they own this woods . When 's the tour leave ? Couple of hours . Let 's go . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're safe . You 're safe . It 's okay you 're here with me . You 're with me . Okay . Okay . Sorry . We should ... We should go . Are you coming at the train station ? I think you have enough people saying goodbye without me there . Only a few I actually cared about . It might be that you 're afraid then ... It 's only a few weeks . I 'll be back before the snow melts . Yeah ? A lot can happen in a few weeks . Are we gonna do this again ? Gale it was an act . Yeah it 's a good one . I did what I had to do to survive . If I didn 't I 'd be dead . I had to do that . At least once . Haymitch ! Haymitch . Haymitch . Wake up . It 's tour day . Haymitch . What are you doing ? Cameras are gonna be here in an hour . If you wanna be babied you should 've asked Peeta . Ask me what ? Ask you to wake me without giving me the moment . You are a strangely dislayered person . What 'd you do to have your first choice ? You like some bread Katniss ? No I ate at the home but thank you . Your welcome . Brrrr . Do you have a lot of warning up to do before showing on ? Which is in an hour so ... Take a bath Haymitch . I just did . Did you have a good walk dear ? Walk ? I was just down ... We have visitors . Miss Everdeen this way please . Such bravery . Such spirit . Such ... content . President Snow . What an honor . My dear I think we can make this so much simpler . If we agree not to lie to each other what do you think ? Yes I think that would save time . Sit down please . I have a problem Miss Everdeen . A problem that began the moment you reveal those poison berries in the arena . If I had head gamemaker Seneca Crane had any brains at all ... He would 've blown you to bits then and there . But here you are I expect you can guess where he is . Yes I think so . After that fiasco there was nothing left to do but to let you play out your little scenario . And you were very good . A hold-down crazed besodded school girl routine . Impressive . Truly . You convince the people in the Capitol . Unfortunately not everyone in the districts fell for it . I mean you can 't know this but several of them . People viewed your little trick with the berries as an act of defiance . Not as an act of love . And if a girl from District 12 of all places can ... defy the Capitol and walk away unharmed ... What is to prevent them from doing the same ? What is to prevent say ... an uprising ? That can lead to revolution . And then in a fraction of time the whole system collapses . It must be a fragile system if it can be brought down by just a few berries . Yes it is indeed . But not in the way you imagined it . How should I imagine ? You should imagine thousands upon thousands of your people dead . This town of yours reduced to ashes . Imagine it gone . A radioactive buried under dirt as if it never existed like District 13 . You fought very hard in the games Miss Everdeen . But they were games . Would you like to be in a real war ? No . Good . And neither would I. Did your mother make these ? Peeta . Aww . Is that a lovely boy ? Tell me . At what point did you realize the depth of your indifference towards him ? I 'm not indifferent . Don 't lie ! You promised . Why don 't you just kill me now ? I don 't want to kill you . I want us to be friends . Better folk friends and allies . What do I need to do ? When you and Peeta are on tour ... You need to smile . You need to be grateful . But above all you need to be madly prepared to end it all in love do you think you can manage that ? Yes . Yes what ? I 'll convince them . No . Convince me . For you Miss Everdeen . You convince me ... for the sake of your loved ones . Stop . Take it all in . This ... is sacred ground . History ... was made here . You 'll get used to the smell . Hello . There she is . My greatest triumph . Sweetie we 've missed you . What a cute lil house . Quaint isn 't it ? Of course you 've heard about Cinna . What happened to Cinna ? Oh dear . He 's a fashion star . You 're his muse . Everyone in the capitol is wearing him . Everyone . Everyone ! Not everyone . Cinna . Katniss ? Katniss is this your sister ? Sweetie . Are you okay ? Yeah Ready to work ? Yeah . Alright good . Welcome . Welcome . Last year the 74th Hunger Game . Promised the greatest love story of our time . Two brave young people against all odds chose to die rather than to lose each other . As a nation . We shared the agony . But we had so little time to revel in their joy ... It 's time . She 's done . She 's lovely . We must feed the monster . You 're excited . You 're in love . Big smiles for the camera in three ... two ... one . [ CAESAR FLICKERMAN ] There she is Katniss Everdeen the girl on fire . And there he is ... Peeta Mellark the baker boy . Uh-oh whoah . I hope they 're alright . Ummm . Ehem . Anyone at home ? Should we come back later ? Sorry Caesar . No please . It 's alright . It 's your day . How 's it going ? We 're good . That 's it ? That 's all we have ? " We 're good . " So tacky all of a sudden . Peeta give me some details . That things are uh ... things are great here in 12 . Thanks to the generosity of the Capitol we 've never been closer . In 25 yards to be exact . Fantastic . We 'll be checking both of you through out the victory tour . Thank you so much Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark . Wonderful . Everybody in motion we are out of here in ten . That 's a nice acting . You too . Most of us think that the kiss is real . Come on in children we are on schedule the train awaits ! Fabulous . Wine massages spa treatments . I told them nothing but the fine treatments for my two victors . It all needs to be ... Fabulous ? Exactly . Now the schedule is a bit of a bare . 12 days 12 districts but its mostly parties celebrations adoring fans to greet you in every stop along the way and then we wrap it up in the Capitol . All you need to do is give a few speeches wave to the crowds and enjoy your time in the spotlight . You 've earned it . What did you say ? Katniss . I said enjoy it Katniss . You 've earned it . By killing people . Young lady . I 'm not really in a mood for a lecture I 'll apologize to Effie later . I thought you were Haymitch . You don 't have to apologize to anybody . Including me . I know its not fair for me to hold you to the things you said in the games . You saved us . I know that . But I can 't go on acting for the cameras and then ... just ignoring each other in real life . So if you stop looking at me like I 'm wounded . Then I can quit acting like it . And then maybe ... We have a shot at being friends . I 've never been really good at friends . For starters it does help me know the person . I hardly know anything about you except that you 're stubborn and go with the bow . That about sums me up . Not most more than that you just don 't wanna tell me . It like I said . You know Katniss the way the whole friend thing works is you have to tell each other the deep stuff . The deep stuff ? Yeah . Uh-oh like what ? Like ummm ... What 's your favorite color ? Well now you 've stepped over the line . Seriously though what is it ? Green . What 's yours ? Orange . Like Effie 's hair ? No . Not that orange more uh ... more like a sunset kind of orange . Did you see that ? What ? Well I never . This is not very festive . The mayor will make some introductory remarks and then you just have to say a few words . It 's customary of course to bring brief eulogy to the fallen tributes . For eleven that 's Thresh and Rue . Here are the speeches . I can do the talking if you want . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen . The victors of the 74th Hunger Games . Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark . Smile . Smile . Smile . Stand up straight . You 're on camera . Thank You . We 're honored to be with you here today . And to be with the families of your fallen tributes . He put down the cards . [ PEETA ] Though they fought ... Why do I bother . ... in dignity and in the end both Thresh and Rue . Were so young . But our lives isn 't just measured in years . We measure the lives of the people we touch around us . For myself . For Katniss . We know that without Rue and without Thresh . We wont be standing here today . So in recognition of that ... No one that did it in no way could make up for your loss . We like to donate one month of our winnings . To the families of the tributes every year for the rest of our lives . Oh shit . Can he do that ? He can 't but he did . Why didn 't he just stick to the cards ? Thank You . I just wanted to say that I didn 't know Thresh I only spoke to him once . He could 've killed me but instead he showed me mercy . It 's a debt that I 'll never be able to repay . I did know Rue . She wasn 't just my ally she was my friend . I see her ... In the flowers that grow in the meadow by my house . I hear her in mockingjay song . I see her and my sister Prim . She was too young . Too gentle . And I couldn 't save her . I 'm sorry . You two have a very simple task . I never meant for anyone to get killed he has to know that . What are you talking about he has to know what ? Snow he came to see me . He 's worried about the rebellion in the districts he thinks they don 't believe our love story . So he wants you to make them believe ? To calm things down . You know Katniss you should 've told me that before I went out there and try to give this people our money . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know what to do . He threatened to kill my family . Well I have family too ! Okay people that I need to protect . What about them ? Who protects them ? Katniss what were you thinking ? I was thinking about Rue . Haymitch please please just help me get through this trip . Please just help me through this . This trip girl wake up ! This trip doesn 't end when you get back home . You never get off this train . You two are mentors now . That means that every year they 're gonna drag you out and broadcast the details of your romance . Every year your private life becomes theirs . From now on your job is to be a distraction so people forget what the real problems are . So what do we do ? You 're gonna smile . You 're gonna read the cards that Effie gave you and you 're gonna live happily ever after . Think you can do that ? Huh ? You 're gonna be okay . I promise Katniss and I wanna share with you our victory . And our gratitude to the Capitol for bringing us together . It was the bond of love forged in the principle of the games is our greatest price . Forged us love and true love that allows us all to marry our hardships . That mends the heart and vanish the loneliness and gives meaning to our lives . We also want to share with you our sorry for your losses . The tributes have this ... The tributes of this district will reign as loyal warriors through our honor to their families and prayer to their people . We are all of us united both victors and vanquished and serving a new common purpose . Thank you.One day I 'm gonna volunteer . Just like you did . It was just a dream I 'm sorry . It 's okay . I am too . Peeta . Will you stay with me ? Yeah . Always . We are all of us united . Both victors and vanquished . In serving a common purpose . The power and glory of the Capitol . Panem today Panem tomorrow Panem forever . Your hair looks lovely darling . When did you start wearing it like that ? Everyone at school wears it like this now grandpa . Snow is watching us . If he wants you to pacify the districts I 'm telling you he 's not happy . Instead of being love you two sounded like you 're reciting from a drilling manual . We try reading what Effie writes us . Tell that to President Snow when you see him two days from now . I 'm open to suggestions . We could get married . That 's not helping . I 'm serious . If like you said we 're on this train forever it 's gonna happen eventually . Why not now ? It does make a statement I 'll give you that . Yeah sure let 's do it . Just when you thought things couldn 't get more exciting going into a very special Quarter Quell our two lethat lovers my favorite expression ... from District 12 has surprised us with a new twist in their love affair . Let 's take a look . The fairy tale ending of the two star-cross lovers ... Are beautiful . Beautiful and then tonight the tour that began in the hollows of District will end where ? The Presidential Palace . The party of the year . Eyes bright . Chins up . Smiles on . I 'm talking to you Katniss . Now there 'll be photographers interviews everyone will be here to celebrate you my victors . Breath . It 's all in children . This is all for you . It 's cozy . Attitude . Come. come . Excuse us . Come come . Hold hands . The library . All mahogany . Hello hello . Not yet not yet . Ooh . Curtains . Everybody is everybody 's here and they all want to meet you . Flavius . Octavia . Try one of these they are divine . I can 't even take it anymore . Here . What 's this ? It 's for when you 're full . It makes you sick . So you can go on eating . How else can you taste everything ? I think it 's time for a dance . Katniss ? People are starving in 12 . Here they just throw in more stuff ... Katniss . Peeta . This ... is Plutarch Heavensbee . Head Gamemaker . Successor to Seneca Crane . It 's a tough act to follow . Peeta . May I ? Please . So how are the party ? It 's a little overwhelming . It 's appalling . Still if you abandon your wrong judgment it can be fun . So are you having fun ? I 'm head gamemaker fun is my job . I thought that 's what happen to Seneca Crane too much fun . Seneca decided to .. uh ... quit breathing . Decided . Is that or poison berries ? Head gamemakers never been the most secure job in the world . And why are you here ? Same reason as you . I volunteered . Why ? Ambition . A chance to make the games mean something . The games don 't mean anything . It only means to scare us . Maybe it 's you who inspired me to come back . The presidential welcome . I 'm sure we 'll meet again . Katniss . Come . The president awaits . Do you think we convince him ? I 'm not sure what else we can do . Tonight . On this the last day of their tour . I want to welcome our two victors . Two young people who embody our ideals . of strength . and valor . And I personally want to congratulate them on the announcement of their engagement . Your love has inspired us . And I know it will go on inspiring us . Everyday . For as long as you may live . Look at them . She 's not who they think she is . She 's not a leader . She just want to save her own skin as simple as that . I think that 's true . She 's become a beacon of hope for the rebellion . And she has to be eliminated . I agree she should die but in the right way . At the right time . It 's move and counter-moves . It 's all we gotta look at . Katniss Everdeen is a symbol . Their Mockingjay . They think she 's one of them . We need to show that she 's one of us . We don 't need to destroy her just the image . Then we let the people do the rest . What do you propose ? Shut down the black markets take away what little they have then double the amount of floggings and executions put them on TV broadcast them live . So fear more fear ... It won 't work . Fear does not work as long as they have hope . And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope . She 's engaged . Make everything about that . What kind of dress she 's gonna wear . Floggings . What 's the cake gonna look like ? Executions . Who 's gonna be there ? Fear . Blanket coverage shove them in their faces . Show them that she 's one of us now . They 're gonna hate her so much they might gonna kill her for you . Brilliant . When did you ... . ? We need to talk . Where are we gonna run away ? Into the woods . Like we always talked about . We can leave right now . We 're gonna be far away from here by tonight . Yeah who 's we ? You me and your fiance ? It 's not just me and Peeta anymore . Snow threaten to have you killed . Anyone else ? Well he didn 't exactly give me the copy of the list but a good guess includes both of our families . Unless what ? You and Peeta get married ? Unless nothing now . Gale we can do it . You said yourself we can do it the morning of the Reaping . What do you say now ? Do you love me ? Gale you know how I feel about you . But I can 't think about anyone that way right now . The only thing that I can think about everyday every waking moment since the Reaping is how afraid I am . There 's no room for anything else . But maybe if we got away from here somewhere safe it could be different . I can be different . You think maybe the President 's bluffing ? He 's not bluffing . Do you know what 's going on in the Districts ? What do you think ? What do you see ? There were people fighting in the streets . Fires and Peacekeepers were pinning them down but the people ... What ? The people are what ? They were fighting back . It 's happening . It 's finally happening . We should 've just eaten the berries in the arena and die like I was supposed to and everything will be back to normal and everyone will be safe . Safe for what ? To starve ? Work like slaves send their kids to the reaping ? You haven 't heard people Katniss you 've given them the opportunity . They just have to be brave enough to take it . There 's already talk in the mines people wanna fight . We have to go Gale before they kill us . They will kill us . What about the other families ? The ones who stay ? What happens to them ? People are looking at you Katniss . I don 't want anyone looking to me . I can 't help them . You do what you want . I 'm staying here . Commander Thread . Welcome to District 12 . Let 's get to work . I 'm gonna get you out of here . In the square . Yeah hold that up there . No . No . No . Katniss . It 's okay . Just go . Move . You want another ? Go ahead . Whoah whoah . Get out of my way . You don 't want to shoot her . How about I shoot both of you ? Look Commander you 're new here . Trust me I 'm trying to help you . I 'm Haymitch . You recognize her ? Katniss Everdeen ? Darling of the Capitol ? She interfered with a Peacekeeper . I never said she was smart . Look you already got a couple of lashes in right ? That 's not good enough . She 's an agitator . Easy . Easy . You sure Snow wants three dead victors here ' cause that 's what we 're looking at . It 's bad enough that you marked up her face at the eve of the big wedding . Let it go . We will too . Alright . Okay . But next time . It 's the firing squad . Excellent idea . I don 't care who she is . Clear the square . You are all under curfew . Anyone out after dark ... Will be shot on sight . Get them out of here . It 's Gale . Get him here . * * * * * * a peacekeeper . Not entirely peaceful . Missed your eye . Doesn 't need stitches . Take a snow coat . Peeta get the snow . I 'll grab my herbs . What is that ? It 's hurting him . It 's a morphling . Mom . No . I 'll do it . Hold him please . That 's better . Hey Katnip . Thought you should be gone by now . I 'm not going anywhere . I 'm gonna stay right here . Me too . Hey . You wanna get some rest I can look after him for a while . Okay umm ... I 'll get him more snow . Hey . How 's your eye ? It 's not my eye that 's bothering me . How can we live like this ? How can anybody live like this ? It 's not living but ... Since the last games something is different . We can see it . What can you see ? Hope . You understand that whatever I do comes back to you and mom . I don 't want you to get hurt . You don 't have to protect me . Or mom . We 're with you . I love you . I love you too . The broadcast cut out here . Before any other excitement happen . How many people saw it ? Hard to say . There was a 5 seconds delay but ... It happened fast . If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen . Then I will have to terminate her . I understand that . And not just her . Her entire species has to be eliminated . Her species sir ? The other victors . Now because of her they all pose a threat . Because of her they all think they 're invincible . Whatever game you think you 're playing ... There are some that are not playing it with you . There 's a way we can still win . It 's what we gamemakers call a " wrinkle " . Ladies and gentlemen . This is the 75th year ... of the Hunger Games . It was written in the charter of the games . In every 25 years there will be a Quarter Quell . To keep fresh for each new generation the memory of those who died . And the uprising agains the Capitol . Each Quarter Quell is distinguished by games ... of a special significance . Now on this eve of 75th anniversary of our defeat of the rebellion . We celebrate the third Quarter Quell . As a reminder . That even the strongest . Cannot overcome . The power of the Capitol . On this the third Quarter Quell game . The male and female tributes . Are to be reaped . From the existing pool of victors . In each district . No . What does that mean ? There she is . Finally get the map huh ? And you 've come to what ? asked me to ? die ? I 'm here to drink . Finally something I can help you with . What its say that Peeta was here 45 minutes ago begging to save your life and you only just now show up ? It means we have to save him . You could live a hundred lifetime and never deserve that boy . Come on Haymitch nobody decent ever wins the games . Nobody ever wins the games . Period . There are survivors . There 's no winners . Peeta has to survive . You have to do whatever it takes to save him . Alright if ... If he call his name I 'll volunteer in his place . Haymitch thank you . But if they call my name and Peeta volunteers there 's nothing I can do . You help him in the arena . Like you did for me . Alright . I think these games are gonna be different . I don 't care . Do whatever you can . Peeta lives . Not me . Promise me . Okay . We should have go when you said . Welcome . Welcome . As we celebrate the 75th anniversary and third Quartel Quell of the Hunger Games . As always ... Ladies First . The female tribute from District 12 Katniss Everdeen . Wonderful . And now for the men . The male tribute from District 12 ... Haymitch Abernathe . I volunteer as tribute . I can 't let you do that . You can 't stop me . Peeta let go . Very well the tributes from District 12 Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark . Well all that remains is ... Oh no . B-b-but . But . Katniss ! I didnt say goodbye . Katniss . The plan is straight to the train . No I didn 't say goodbye . Katniss ! Goodbye . All right . Before we begin I 've had a thought . You don 't say . Katniss has her gold Mockingjay pin . I have my hair . I 'm gonna get you two boys something gold . Err .. why is that ? A token . Show them we are a team . And they cant just ... Thank you . Alright now . Everything will be different because it 's a Quarter Quell . The Capitol has spared no expense . A new training center a new tribute living quarters and of course a very special arena . But this year you 'll be facing other victors Capitol favorites . Smart cunning skilled . And they all know one another . You two are the outsiders . I want you guys to forget everything you think you knew about the games . Last year was child 's play . This year you 're all dealing with all experienced killers . Alright . What 's that mean for us ? That means you 're gonna have to have some allies . Okay . I think that if we ... You 're not the problem . No . Look you 're starting at a disadvantage . Most of these people have been friends for years . That just put us higher in their kill list . Do it your own way but I know these people . You 're going alone their first move is to gonna be to hunt you down . Both of you . Katniss come on . How could any of us trust each other ? It 's not about trust . It 's about staying alive . Cashmere and Gloss . Brother and sister . District 1 . They won back to back game . Capitol favorites . Lot of sponsors . They will be lethal . And the other half of the career pack ? Brutus and Enobaria . What 's with her teeth ? She had them filed into fangs so she can rip people throats out . She 's committed I 'll give her that . Wiress and Beetee . Not fighters but brain and weird . Real tech savvy . He won his game by electrocuting six tributes at once . The Morphlings . Masters of camouflage . Basically won their game by hiding until everyone else was dead . Self medicating ever since . Not a threat . Finnick Odair right ? Yes . He won his game at fourteen . Youngest ever . Extremely humble . You 're kidding ? Yes I 'm kidding . He 's a peacock . A total prainer . But he 's the Capitol darling they love him here . Charming smart and very skilled in combat especially in water . What about weaknesses ? One . Mags . She volunteered for Annie . Mags was his mentor and basically raise him and he 's trying to protect her in any way it exposes him . A guy like that has to know she 's not gonna make it . And what it really comes down to protect her ? Well Katniss I just hope when she goes she goes quickly . She 's actually umm ... a wonderful lady . How do we get here huh ? Katniss . Hello Finnick . Do you want a sugar cube ? I mean its supposed to be for the horses but ... I mean who cares about them right ? They got years to eat sugar . You and I well at least this is something sweet you better grab them . No thanks . But I would love to borrow that outfit someday . You look pretty terrifying in that get-up . What happen to the pretty little girl dresses ? I outgrew them . You certainly did . Shame about this Quell thing . Now you you could 've made out like a bandit in the Capitol jewels money anything you wanted . Well I don 't like jewels and I have more money than I need so ... What did you do with all your wealth anyway ? I haven 't dealt with anything as common as money in years . Well then how do people pay with the pleasure of your company . With secrets . What about you girl on fire ? Any secrets worth my time ? I 'm an open book . Everybody always seems to know my secrets before I know them myself . Unfortunately I think that 's true . I 'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding . I know how devastating that must be for you . Have a good day . Peeta . Finnick . What 'd he want ? To know all my secrets . I have to get in line . Nobody begets smile this time . I want you to look straight ahead as if the audience of this whole event will be beneath you . That should be easy . Press this when you 're ready . Goodluck . Here they come . From District 12 our favorite . Or my favorite . There it is . Fire in the house . Nice . Way to make friends out there you two . Well we 've learned from the best . I want to introduce you to some special friends of mine . This is Seer and Chaff . From District 11 . He 's very friendly . Don 't invite him over ... he 'll drink up your liquor . I 'll see you guys soon . Let 's get some of that make up off and talk about this other tributes . This tributes are crazy . No not all of them . He 's a good guy . Carry on . You guys look amazing . Thank you . My stylist is such an idiot . District 7 . Lumber . Trees . Ugh . I 'd love to put an axe on her face . So what do you think ? Now that the whole world wants to sleep with you . I don 't think that the whole world ... I wasn 't talking to you . Wanna unzip ? Bye . Let 's do it again sometime . Thank you . Johanna Mason District 7 . Remember Katniss days go making allies . So far I 'm not overwhelmed by our choices . Guess we just try to figure it out there 's no going backwards from there . Friction generates heat heat generates fire . You should move your hands downward . And faster . I love brute force . It 's always helpful . Thank you . By the corner of the table . Plutarch ? No . Next to him . Force field . How do you know ? A shimmering . Top left hand side . There . You see it ? Looks like glass . To separate us and them . Probably my fault I shot an arrow on them last year . Ahh electromagnetic . How can you tell ? Is that obvious or something ? Look around you . All the holograms the lights have been flickering why ? Because the force field is taking up too much energy . There 's always a flaw in the system . That 's beautiful . I saw you volunteer for that young girl . That was really brave . Prim is my sister . If you umm ... If you teach me how to make a fish hook like that I could teach you how to hunt . Do you want to try it with me ? Okay . I 'll go first . Good news . At least have the tributes wants you as an ally . I mean they saw her shoot . Well sweetheart you got your pig of the litter . I want Wiress and Beetee . Joanna calls them Nuts and Volts . Now okay good now who else ? Mags ? Alright fine then no one . I 'll tell them you 're still making up your mind . District 3 . Betee Latear . Report for individual assessment . Peeta how are we gonna kill these people ? District 12 . Katniss Everdeen . Report for individual assessment . Miss Everdeen ? Miss Everdeen ? You have ten minutes to present your chosen skill . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Good evening and tonight ! On the eve of the 75th Hunger Games . We 've never seen anything like this and we will never see anything like it again . Because tonight on this day 24 of Panem 's brightest stars will buy for the ultimate crown . Tonight will be their final opportunity to express their thoughts ... Our final opportunity to express our love ... Heartbreakingly . To say goodbye to all but one . What a night . Let 's hear it . A wedding dress ? President Snow insisted but I I made a few alterations . You became everyone 's brother and sister . I don 't know how are we going to let you go . We 're not going by choice . You are our family . And I don 't see how anyone can love us better . Such so sweet . Are you alright dear ? I 'm sorry . That 's alright . I just can 't stop crying . God does anybody actually believe this ? Apparently everybody . She is very good . These victors are angry Katniss . They 'll say anything to try and stop the games . I suggest you do the same . Beetee . You have contributed so much to Panem over the years I don 't know who will we miss more . You or your brain ? The Quarter Quell were written in law by man certainly it can be unwritten . Yes interesting concept . Finnick . I understand that you have a message to somebody out there . A special somebody . Let me hear it . My love . You have my heart . For all eternity . If ... If I die in that arena . My last thought would be of your lips . We have seen a lot of tears here tonight . But I see no tears in Johanna 's eyes . Johanna you are angry tell me why ? Well yes I 'm angry . You know I 'm totally getting screwed over here . Uh-huh . The deal was that if I won the Hunger Games I get to live the rest of my life in peace . But now you wanna kill me again . But you know what ? Fuck that ! Fuck anybody that has to do with it ! Alright then . One little 's opinion . Who 's next ? Now turn around . Think I 'm done . Will I be twirling tonight ? Save it for the end . One minute till showtime dear . Katniss . You would 've been the most beautiful bride . Thank you . Let 's go show them what real beauty looks like . It has to go up ! Katniss everyone 's gonna adore you . And there are a lot of sponsors in the audience . So of course just be your usual self . Actually be your happier self . Really ? A wedding dress ? Snow made me wear it . Ladies and gentlemen . Make him pay for it . The victor of last year 's Hunger Games Katniss Everdeen . You look fabulous doesn 't she ? My my . Whooh whooh whoooh . Now Katniss This is ... A very big ... And very emotional ... night . For all of us . Wouldn 't you say ? Now don 't go crying on me now Caesar . I can 't be getting promises you know me . You know I wouldn 't believe you even if you did . I love it . The girl on fire is so chicky . But Katniss . On more serious note . I think we 're all here a little disappointed more than a little disappointed that a certain wedding did not take place . Are we folks ? Alas . But . Am I correct and assuming that this is the gown that you would have worn on that day yes or no ? Yes . President Snow thought everyone would want to see it . Well President Snow as usual was right . Was he not folks ? Will you do us the honor please please please ? Oh my God . It 's like uh ... it 's like a bird ... it 's like umm ... umm ... A Mockingjay . Your stylist has certainly outdone himself this time . Cinna . Take a bow . But Peeta . The wedding . The marriage . Never to be ? Well actually we got married . In secret . A secret wedding ? Alright do tell ? We want our love to be eternal . You know Katniss and I ... We 've been luckier than most and I wouldn 't have any regrets at all ... If uh ... if it weren 't ... If it weren 't ? If it weren 't for what ? what ? If it weren 't for the baby . Alright . This is news . Let 's find out more . Calm down this is news to all of us . There 's no way they 'll cancel . They can 't . Baby bum that 's a stroke of genius . Unfortunately the games are still on . This is goodbye for now . Presents for the boys . What is this ? Your token remember ? Hair for me pin for Katniss . Gold bangle for you . For Peeta a medallion that we talked about . Thank you Effie . We 're a team aren 't we ? And I 'm so proud of my victors . So proud . I am so ... Well you both deserve so much better . Thank you Effie . I am truly sorry . Thank you Haymitch . For everything . Any last advice ? Stay alive . Haymitch wait . Remember our deal . Do whatever it takes to keep him alive . Katniss when you 're in the arena . Remember who the real enemy is . I don 't want to be with anyone else in there . Just you . If that 's what you want . That 's what I want . I 'll see you soon . Your tracker . Look at this they 're holding hands . I want them dead . Be patient . They 're holding hands now but the minute the guns go off it will be a bloodbath . The whole idea of revolution will be discredited . And the idea of her ? The idea of the Mockingjay ? The more allies she betrays . The more friends she kills . The more she reveals her true self . As long as it ends of her picture in the sky and the sound of cannon . And it shall . It better . Let 's watch her get her hands dirty first . Excuse me . Let 's start . The suit is light . No thermal . So I 'd guess tropics or deserts . Sixty seconds till launch . That dress was beautiful . I think it 's the best one you ever made . If I didn 't like it ? I just wanted to tell you because I know ... Stop . Remember I 'm still betting on you girl on fire . Ten seconds till launch . No . Cinna ! No ! No ! Cinna ! No ! No ! No ! Let the 75th Hunger Games begin . May the odds be ever in your favor . Ten . Nine . Eight . Seven . Six . Five . Four . Three Two One . Good thing we 're allies right ? Where did you get that ? Where do you think ? Duck . Don 't trust 1 and 2 . I 'll take this side you hold them off . I 'll go find Peeta . Mags found him he 's over here . Katniss . Katniss . Go . Go . Go . Okay hold up . Hold up ! God it 's hot . We gotta find fresh water . I guess they 're not holding hands anymore . You think that 's funny ? Everytime that cannon goes off it 's music to my ears . I don 't care about any of them . Good to hear . Wanna face the grey pack alone ? What would Haymitch say ? Haymitch isn 't here . Let 's keep moving . Peeta no ! Peeta ? He 's not breathing . He 's not breathing . Peeta ! Peeta . Peeta . Come on . Come on . Please wake up . Please wake up . Come on . Come on . Bring me in closer . Cannon ready ? Come on . Come on Peeta . Please Peeta . Oh my God . Be careful there 's a force field out there . You 're dead . You 're dead . You 're heart stopped . It 's okay . It 'w working now . Do you wanna stand up ? Someday I want to love someone that much . And so you shall my darling . So you shall . Hang on . A force field . It 's a dome . We 're at the edge of the arena . I couldn 't find any signs of fresh water . It 's gonna get dark soon . We 'll be safe if our backs protected . We should set up camp . Take turns sleeping . I can take first watch . Not a chance . Honey that thing I did back there for Peeta that 's called saving his life . If I wanna kill either of you I would 've done it by now . Why don 't you get some rest I 'll take the first watch . Just for a little bit . How 's Peeta ? He 's okay . He hide her like the rest of them . Drink up . What is it ? It 's from Haymitch . I think it 's a spile . Okay . Here we go . I counted twelve . Midnight ? Or the number of districts . Well ... If you wont go to sleep ... I will . Okay . Run ! Run . The fog is poisoned . Mags . Mags please come on . Come on . Peeta . I can 't carry him . Peeta please . We have to go . Mags ? Mags ! Mags ! Mags ! Mags ! Finnick we have to go . We have to get out of here . We have to go . Alright come on . Come on . The water . The water helps . I 'm sorry about Mags . She was never gonna make it . Peeta ? Yeah ? Walk over here slowly . Get to the beach . Who is that ? The morphling . Help me get her . Hey hey . It 's okay . It 's okay . Shh . Shh . Shh . Hey do you wanna see something ? Look up . Look . Look at that . It 's incredible ins 't it ? All those colors . Don 't worry about anything else . We 're here with you . She sacrificed herself for me and I don 't even know her name . Do you think she sacrificed herself ? Look like it . That doesn 't make any sense . For you . Thank you . That 's new . Someone 's here . Johanna ? Johanna ! Finnick ! I guess we got more allies . Well I got them out . It 's when the rain started . I though it was water ... It turned out to be blood . Hot thick blood that 's coming down . It 's choking us . We were stumbling around gagging on it blind . That 's when Blight hit the force field . He wasn 't much but he was from home . Tick tock . What 's wrong with her ? She 's in shock . Tick tock . Dehydration isn 't helping . Do you have fresh water ? We can get some water . Tick tock . Stop it . I got them out for you ! Let me go . For me ? What does that mean ? If we want them as allies . Come on let 's get you cleaned up . Tick tock . Tick tock . Tick tock . Tick tock . What is Beetee doing up there ? A coil ? Some kind of wire . He got it from the Cornucopia ? Took a knife in the back to get it . Tick tock . I cannot . Have fun with nuts . Tick tock . It 's a clock . It 's a clock . Oh my God it 's a clock . Wiress you 're a genius . You 're a genius . This entire arena seems to be laid off like a clock . With a new threat every hour . But they stay only within their wedge . It all starts with the lightning . Then blood rain fog and monkeys . That 's the first four hours . At ten that big wave heads from over there . Wiress you 're a genius . Well the tail points at twelve . That 's where the lightning strikes at noon and midnight . Where ? That big tree . Good . Hickory Dickory dock . The mouse run up the clock . The clock stroke one . The mouse run done . Hickory Dickory dock . So twelve and one lightning . then one to two is blood . then fog . Then monkeys . Hickory Dickory dock . Nothing but blood . It doesn 't matter if we know which sector is acting . We 'll be safe . Change it up spin it . Okay that 's enough . Conceal till they tilt down now . You okay ? Let 's just get what we need and get off the bloody island . So besides Brutus and Enobaria who 's left ? Maybe Chaff just those three . They know they 're outnumbered I doubt they 'll attack again . We 're safe here on the beach . What do we do ? We hunt them down ? Katniss help me ! Prim ! Prim ! Katniss Katniss . Wait ! Katniss ? You okay ? Finnick ! No it 's not . Annie ! Finnick it 's not her . It 's just a jabberjay . It 's not her . How do they make that goddamn sound ? Jabberjays copy . Gale ! They 're gone . The hour 's up . The hour 's done . It 's alright . They won 't touch Prim . Your fiance 's right . The whole country loves your sister . If they torture her or do anything to her . Forget the districts there would be riots in the damn Capitol . Hey how does that sound Snow ? What if we set your backyard on fire ? You know you can 't put everybody in here . What ? Can 't hurt me . There 's no one left that I love . I 'll get you some water . Thank you . Who 's Annie ? Annie Cresta the girl Mags volunteered for ? She won like four years or five ... years ago . Is she the one that went a little ... Love is weird . I have a plan . Finnick . I have a plan . Where are the careers head to the safest ? The jungle ? Jungle 's a nightmare . Probably here on the beach . Then why are they not here ? Because we are . We claimed it . And if we left they would come ? Or stay hidden in the tree line . Which in just over four hours will be soaked from water from the ten o 'clock wave . What happens at midnight ? Lightning strikes that tree . Here 's what I propose . We leave the beach at dusk . We head to the lightning tree . That should draw them back to the beach . Prior at midnight we then run this wire from the tree to the water . Anyone in the water or in the damn sand will be electrocuted . How do we know that the wire 's not gonna burn up ? Because I invented it . I assure you it won 't burn up . Well it 's better than hunting them down . Yeah why not . If it fails no harm done anyway right ? Alright so we try it . So what can we do to help ? Keep me alive for the next 6 hours ? That would be extremely helpful . I think we need to go . The plan 's gonna work . I think so too . Once the career are dead we both know what happens next . I don 't wanna be the one that shoots first . What if they don 't either ? What if all of us doesn 't shoot first ? We might still end up dead . I mean not it works for us last time . They 're not gonna make that same mistake again . You know and I know there 's only one person walking out of here and that 's gonna be one of us . Careers are still out there . We just have to take this guy at midnight . And if we heard a cannon we go . Katniss . I don 't know what kind of deal you made with Haymitch but he kept me promises too . If you die ... then I live . I 'd have nothing . Nobody else I care about . Peeta . It 's different for you . Your family needs you . You have to live . For them . What about you ? Nobody needs me . I do . I need you . Alright lovebirds . She has preparing to fight . That 's our girl . This is what you predicted ? Moves and counter moves . Indeed . We 'll toast when it 's done . For the meantime . Make yourself comfortable . Minimal drawing . Impressive conductor . Let 's get started . Typically a lightning strike contains 5 million jolts of energy . We don 't wanna be here in the vicinity when this hits . You two girls Take this . Unspool it carefully . Make sure the entire coil is in the water . Understand ? Then head to the tree to the 2 head sector . we 'll meet you there . I 'm gonna go with you as a guard . No no no . You stay . You have to protect me . And the tree . No . I need to go with her . There are two careers out there I need two guards . Finnick can protect you fine on his own . Yeah why can 't Finnick and Johanna stay with you . Peeta and I will take the coil . You all agreed to keep me alive til midnight correct ? It 's his plan . We all agreed to it . Is there a problem here ? Excellent question . There 's no problem . I 'll see you at midnight . Alright let 's go . Come on . I wanna put as much distance to the beach as possible . Frying is not how I intended to go . Stay down . Come on . Johanna where are you ? Johanna ? Peeta ? Peeta . Peeta . Katniss where are you ? ! Let it fly miss Everdeen . Let ... it ... fly . Katniss . Remember who the real enemy is . Katniss get away from that tree . Katniss get away from that tree . Heavensbee . Plutarch Heavensbee . Sir . We 've lost power . Morning sweetheart . What are you doing with them ? You and a syringe against the Capitol . So unless like you who wants to make the plans . - What the hell are you doing in here ? - Stop . Stop . Just listen . We couldn 't tell you with Snow watching it 's too risky . Better for you to know nothing . Where 's Peeta ? You have been our mission from the beginning . The plan was always to get you out . Half the tributes where on it . This is the revolution . And you are the Mockingjay . And we 're on our way to District 13 right now . Thirteen ? Thirteen yes . Where 's Peeta ? He still has his tracker on his arm Johanna cut yours out . Where is he ? In the Capitol . They got him and Johanna . You son of a bitch . You son of a . You promise me that you would save him over me . You promise me . You 're a liar . You 're a liar . Hey Katnip . You 're okay . You 're just asleep for a few days . Are we home ? Gale ? Where 's Prim ? She 's alive . So is your mother . I got them out in time . Got them out ? After the games ... And the start dropping off firebombs . Right here in twelve ? There is no District 12 . It 's all gone .

Are you suggesting he knew ? Little fucker might have phoned home . There might even be a rescue party on the way . Zoil , we need to break out the big guns . Do you think that that 's wise ? The last thing we need is a hoo-ha . WOMAN : Maybe you 're right . Listen , I got two rookies on a special mission 75 clicks north of you . I 'll have them set up a roadblock . These are just civilians . Why don 't you let me take care of it ? You might need the extra muscle . Just keep them in the dark . I don 't want any loose ends .

Paul is from a small M-class planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy . Thank you . He looks too obvious . There 's a reason for that , Clive .

You caught that ? Did I catch it ? Oh , my God . - Like a cold , I caught it . - ( LAUGHING ) I think it 's pretty obvious what happened there , isn 't it ? is it ? The government used some kind of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox . It caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien . It makes complete sense . - PAUL : Wrong ! - ( BOTH SCREAMING ) - Oh ! - ( TIRES SCREECHING ) - ( YAWNING ) - ( MIMICKING LASER GUN FIRING ) Your dick is gone . Oh , no ! PAUL : What ?

Right , because tea is weird in America . - They leave the bag in . - ( PAUL WHISTLING TUNE ) What 's weird , Graeme , is the fact that we 've picked up an extraterrestrial hitchhiker and you seem completely fine with it ! ( SINGING ) Bagels and coffee Ooh ! Marmite ! He said his life 's in danger . He needs our help , you know ? Sometimes , you 've just gotta roll the dice . What if we wake up and find him inserting a probe into our anus ? Apparently , they don 't do that . PAUL : Anyone want one of these ? Eh ? Anyone ? Anyone ? Eh ? Forty-eight , 49 , 50 . Coming !

We 've only just met , we don 't know where we 're going , or why . You don 't think we 're due an explanation ? Look , the less you guys know , the better . I want you to have plausible deniability . ( SIGHS ) Let 's just say I spent a long time at that base thinking I was a guest . Turns out I was a prisoner . But don 't worry. I got it all under .. .

PAUL : I 'm in the can. I ate a closed pistachio . ( FARTING ) I 'm paying for it . ( CHUCKLES ) - That 's a nice T-shirt . - Oh , thanks. I got it at my church . It 's Jesus shooting Charles Darwin . Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin ? Because of his blasphemous theories . Are you men of God ? We 're men of science , you know . We believe in the establishment of a biological order through the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos . The world is 4,000 years old and can only be the product of intelligent design . - PAUL : Oh , that 's horseshit . - Oh ! ( SCOFFS ) All right , well , then , please explain how something as complex as the human eye simply just comes into being . ( LAUGHS ) PAUL : It didn 't just come into being .

We 've gone through this ! They faint ! But we 're going to have to take her with us now ! No ! No ! This is America . Kidnapping a Christian ? That 's worse than harbouring a fugitive . But she 's seen you . If we leave her , she 's going to call the police ! Who gives a shit ? No one 's going to believe this God-bothering Cyclops . Let 's just dump her on the road ! Just roll her up in the rug . We can 't risk that ! If we take her with us , then we can get her on our side ! You 'd love to get her on her side , wouldn 't you ? That doesn 't make sense . Look . She 'll be fine . We 're quite nice . All right . What about my passport ? Oh , God ! You guys . PAUL : Mmm-hmm . ( GASPS ) No ! ( GRUNTS ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( LAUGHS ) Oh , shit .

And we 'll let you go just as soon as we can . You 've been deceived by an agent of Satan himself . - He 's evil ! - I 'm sitting right here , come on ! No , he 's not evil , he 's just a bit rude . We 're trying to help him get home . He 's from another world . There 's only one world , our world ! The world that our God , the Father , created ! If it makes you feel any better my existence only disproves traditional notions of the Abrahamic , Judeo-Christian God , as well as all one-world theologies . That 's all I meant . ( SINGING ) Amazing Grace , how sweet the sound - You can 't win with these people ! - ( RUTH CONTINUES SINGING ) Ruth , just listen to me , for one second .

He always knew what was going on in Battlestar before me 'cause his mum had cable . Fine , pull over . I 'll do you . Absolutely not . No spoilers . MOSES : I didn 't call the government . I called the police ! This is not the police 's area of expertise , Mr Buggs . - That devil took my daughter . - What do you mean , devil ? And your daughter 's name is Ruth , is it ? That 's right. I brought her up by myself after her mama died . ZOIL : Do you have a photograph of Ruth , sir ? Yeah . She 's pretty easy to spot . She 's had this eye thing since she was four years old . Do you have a phone here that your daughter might try to reach you at if she decides to call ? Yeah , in the back . Hey , Peter Parker . Want to put the snappy down and get to the phone ? ( EXHALES ) Right . MOSES : She 'll call me if she can . ZOIL : You mentioned they went east ? MOSES : That 's right . - ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - They 'll get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ain 't on the interstate . There 's been a big-rig spill .. . ( HAGGARD READING ) ZOIL : Here we go . Boys , to the car . Sir , you mind telling us what we 're looking for ? Yeah , what are we looking for ? I told you this is a need-to-know operation .

Are they looking right now ? ( LAUGHING ) Sorry . That 's pathetic . What 's your beef , Clive ? I don 't have a beef . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm from outer space . You 're a science-fiction writer . We should be best buds . It 's not you . It 's me . ( INAUDIBLE ) ls that what this is ? You 're jealous ? Of her ? CLIVE : It 's not just that . PAUL : Whoa . Of me ? This is because me and Graeme got two minutes of face-time while you were sleeping ? - ls that what this is ? - l wanted this to be special , you know ? I have dreamt about meeting you ( CHUCKLES ) ever since I saw Mac and Me . And I blew it . Now you two are friendly , and he 's off talking to girls and it 's like , where am I ? Come on , man . This is special . You guys being all nerdy and shit and meeting me . That is fate . Who cares if you pissed your pants , man ? When I first got here , first time I saw a human , I puked . You guys are weird looking . You have giant bodies . You have tiny , little , tiny heads . - You 're just being nice now . - ( LAUGHS ) No . Look , you want a little sugar ? ( NERVOUS GROAN ) It 's just knowledge and experience , man . You 're a writer . Might give you some inspiration . Will it hurt ? Only if you struggle . All right .

Ruth , I 'm not sure this is helping . What are you doing ? - ( EXCLAIMS ) Stop it ! - Why ? Why should I stop ? ( EXCLAIMS ) This is not .. . Because you have your whole life to explore new things . Okay ? It doesn 't necessarily mean you should be exploring mine right now . You said you wanted to travel , to see new stuff ? This is your chance . I really think you should come with us . Where would I sleep ? I 'll sleep on the sofa . And then you can have my bed . But I 'd push the tissues off with a pen , if I were you , because I 've had a cold . Oh . ( REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ) Ruth has decided that she would like to come with us . ( EXHALES ) Wicked . I 'm gonna go freshen up . Hey , Ruth . Wait up . You don 't smoke . I just wanted to say thanks . I know this has been weird for you , but you saved my life and I owe you one , okay ? Okay . What have you got there , by the way ? Severe epiretinal membrane complicated by macular edema in your left vitreous cavity ? How did you know that ? Lucky guess . Do you mind if I take a look at it for one second ? What does it say in the Old Testament ? " An eye for an eye " ? - Wait , I don 't .. . - It 's okay . You can trust me . - l don 't know .. . - Just have a little faith , okay ? ( GRUNTING ) ( CONTINUES GRUNTING ) ( GASPS ) Oh ! How did you do that ? Evolution , baby . ( PAUL CHUCKLES ) - Graeme ? - Yeah ? GRAEME : Oh , my God .

Just make small corrections . PAUL : Graeme , hit the brakes ! Hey , there , sleepy face ! Fuckeroo . That was the best titty-farting sleep I have ever had . I got a feeling that you 're new to cursing , Ruth . Look , cursing 's fun . You just gotta pick your moments , okay ? Maybe we should stop for some food . is anybody hungry ? - Fuck , yeah ! - GRAEME : Ruth ? You bet your big , fat cock I am ! Nice ! CLIVE : I 'm starving . What 's new , fatty ? - It 's not fat , Paul , it 's power . - PAUL : Fat power . - So rude . - PAUL : You 're rude . RUTH : Maybe I should call my dad . - What ? - What ? Why ? I 've been gone for a whole day and if he calls the police , they 're gonna be looking for us . If I don 't , there 's a good chance we could all end up in Shit-Butt City . You 're really getting the hang of this . Thanks , dick milk . ( PAUL GROANS ) ( MOTORCYCLE REVVING ) ( WOMAN WHOOPING ) ( BAND PLAYING COUNTRY MUSIC ) - l won 't be long . - Okay . Be careful . ( RINGING ) - ZOIL : Ruth Buggs ? - Yes ? Listen to me carefully . I want you to tell me where you are . Who is this ? My name is Agent Zoil , and it 's very important that you tell me where you are and where you are headed , Ms Buggs . I can 't tell you . I mean , I don 't know . You 've been abducted . And the individual that you 're travelling with is highly dangerous . Oh , no , he 's not dangerous . I mean , he 's kind of rude , he curses a lot , and a couple times I 've seen him scratch his spaceman balls . ( LAUGHING ) Please listen to me . Your father is extremely worried about you and we 'd like to get you home , Ms Buggs . He showed me things . She 's talking about his spaceman balls . You know I 'm just trying to help you , right , Ruth ? I don 't know what 's real any more . I 'm confused . - We got the bitch ! - O 'REILLY : Yeah , dog ! Up high ! ZOIL : Damn it , Haggard !

That is exactly what they 'll expect us to do . Trust me . Only an idiot would stop right now . - Yeah , pull in here . Perfect . - CLIVE : What ? Paul . PAUL : We 're idiots , remember ? What should we do now ? How about a hot chocolate and bed ? What are you , my grandma ? Oh , I couldn 't sleep . I 'm too pumped . Yeah , me , too . Let 's get some beers . Find somewhere to chill . What do you say ? What if someone sees you ? It 's dead out there . And I can do this . ( INHALES ) Okay . I 'm in . - PAUL : Rocky ? - Sure . PAUL : Bullwinkle ? I 'm a little bit tired .

GRAEME : It 's a little cowboy , isn 't it ? ( BOTH LAUGHING ) GRAEME : That 's funny . I 'll tell you what else is funny , was when you kissed me yesterday . ( BOTH CHUCKLING ) - Sorry . - No . It 's not .. . I was like , " Get off me , you rapist . ' ' - Do it again , if you like . - What ? I said you can do it again , if you like . Really ? If you 're gonna try it , then maybe you should do it with a friend , rather than someone like a stranger because there 's a lot of weirdos out there . I am planning on doing a lot of kissing and fornicating so you 'd really be helping me out . - Great . - Okay . - ( GASPS ) What , now ? - No , I thought you meant .. . No , I did . Let 's do it now . - l mean .. . - Yeah , all right . Put my hands on you . Just stand here ? Okay . Hold you steady . - ( PAUL EXHALES ) - ( BOTH GASP ) Fuck ! I 'm sorry. I thought I was gonna pass out . ( EXHALES ) Carry on . - What 's happening ? - Nothing , just hanging around . They were about to make out . It was awkward . We were just .. . Good . Please put your shorts on , Paul . You guys partake ? No , thank you . I 'll partake . Are you sure ? ( LAUGHING ) It 's pretty strong shit . I got it from the military , actually . This is the stuff that killed Dylan . Bob Dylan 's not dead . Isn 't he ? Hit me . Okay . Just go easy on it . Ruth . Just a little bit . Little bit . It 's not so bad . To be fair , it takes a while to be absorbed into .. . - ( LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ) - PAUL : Oh , shit . ( GASPS ) I 'm hungry . We should cook up some sausages . - Do we have any sausages ? - Uh .. . - What do you mean by that ? - No . Why do you guys hate me ? Can we cook up some sausages ? Ooh , I have wasps in my brain ! ( CLATTERING ) She 'll be fine . That happened to me the first time . Paul . I was wanting to ask . You know us now , right ? Yeah . Graeme , we 're bona fide BFFs . ( SPITS ) ( LAUGHS ) Why are you in such a hurry to leave now ? ( EXHALES ) Well , according to the government , I 've fulfilled my usefulness . I told them everything I know . The only thing I have left to offer them now are my abilities . The healing , the thought transfer , the camouflage . In order to cultivate those abilities , they need some of my stem cells . And I 'm not really down with that . Lucky for me , I do have one friend left on the inside . So , I managed to get an SOS beamed into space . I got my people primed and ready to pick me up . Then , motherfuckers brought the procedure forward by a day , my whole plan goes to shit . What happened ? On the way to the mental labs , I zapped my escort , I stole his car , I took off . Found you guys . So what happens if you get caught ? Graeme , they 're gonna cut out my brain . Oh . PAUL : Yeah . It 's fucked . It 's kind of a buzz-kill . Let 's lighten the mood , shall we ?

Oh , man . I can 't hold my breath the whole way through town . Wait here . What ? Wait ! Good morning . Agent Zoil , Secret Service . You mind if I come in there and ask a few questions ? Not at all . Morning . - PAUL : Why are we holding hands ? - So we look like a family . PAUL : Yeah , the fucking Friedmans . You could be a midget . - You 're obsessed with midgets ! - No , I 'm not ! ( WHISPERING ) Stop it ! Just act normal . We 're just a couple of regular guys walking down the street with a small cowboy . All right , Clive ? Clive ? - Clive . - PAUL : Oh , come on ! ( WHISPERING ) Clive , what are you doing ? PAUL : Yeah , man , what the fuck ? I want it . I can appreciate it 's a bargain , but this is not Comic-Con now . This is reality . PAUL : It 's false economy anyway , it 'll break the first time you use it . Let 's go ! - Why would I ever use it ? - Can we just go , please ? Wait . Maybe we should go inside . GRAEME : What ?

I kept you warm and comfortable . I sat there with you till the men came to take you away . When word got out about my story , kids used to come and throw stones at the house , call me names .

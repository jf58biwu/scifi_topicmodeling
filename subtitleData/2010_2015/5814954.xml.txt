 General , maybe you should slow down , we have a big day tomorrow . We 're celebrating , Captain . It 's not every day you win a war , let alone against the American devils . I 'm getting another bottle . Excuse me . I 'm pretty sure it was my fault . You speak Vietnamese . I 'm an interpreter . I speak many tongues . Let me buy you another drink ... unless you 're here with someone . No , I came here alone . A bottle of Johnnie Walker , Please . You 're going to the summit tomorrow ? A pretty girl interested in politics ... Looks can be deceiving . Terrible thing . What is ? Being born like that . Is it ? Can you imagine ... looking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you ? Yes , I can . Where do you think she comes from ? You think she has a family ?

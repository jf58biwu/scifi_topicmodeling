 Sever Studio with Russia 1 TV Channel . Producers : R. Nasibulin , V. Izvekov Production Manager : M. Dovladbegyan . This is not Earth . It 's another planet ... identical , about 800 years behind . There were a few similar planets . This one was smaller and closer . And local Gray castles were reminiscent of early Renaissance . So about 30 scientists were sent here . But " Renaissance " didn 't happen here . Just a reaction to something that almost didn 't happen . In the city of Arkanar , the capital of Oltregolfo , it started with destroying the university of the way of thinking . And a hunt for thinkers - wise guys - Based on Hard to Be a Goa ' , a novel by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky bookworms and talented artisans . Some fled to the neighboring Irukan . It was better there . Others broke down or were executed . By the squads of Don Reba , the Crown Security Minister . Squad members - drovers and shopkeepers - wore gray . Gray troops , gray minister , the color of the local stone , of the worst quality . The royal guard was pushed aside . Nothing hit , or pinched , even ! Screenplay by S. Karmalita , A. German . Poverty , poverty . Director : A. Yu . German . Enough , enough , enough . The stones were white and flat . Cinematography by V. Llyin , Yu . Klimenko . Fika , the redheaded butcher , where is he ? Production design by S. Kokovkin , G. Kropachev , E. Zhukova . Rains here were short and sticky . But the fogs were long . They came from the gulf and returned there . HARD TO BE A GOD He often cried in his sleep . Because he killed , in his sleep . He wasn 't allowed to kill , ever . Then he heard his grandma 's voice . From his childhood on Earth . " The child is crying . " She smoked a cigarette and said , " Children 's tears are water . It 's all in your head , boy ! " . The Noble Don Rumata - Leonid Yarmolnik . He felt smoke on his forehead , but it was only the draft ' from a crack , where he had ordered to place a large chest . He grasped the bed sheet tightly , only to wake up . A chimney smoked downstairs in his huge castle . The slaves spoke loudly , though it was forbidden . He was not on Earth , but on a different planet . Here he was a 17th-generation noble don . An illegitimate son of Goran , a local pagan god . Born from the god 's mouth . Not everyone believed this . But everyone was on guard . Did you feed the turtle , idiot ? Mice lick off the lard . They do . Are you wearing my boots again ? It happened . It always happens to you . Costumes by Ye . Shapkaitz Makeup by O. Izvekova , N. Ratkevich . The boots on the table . Music by V. Lebedev Sound by N. Astakhov I 'll hang myself . What ? I 'll hang myself . What ? Why are you so loud when I 'm sleeping ? I 'd sell you all at the port . You too . It 's a pity slaves have fallen in price . That 's the way it is . Die , you monster ! You die ! It 's autumn , there are no mice . Special thanks to A. German Jr . My whole life - A goose drowned here . A painting ! It 's a bit shallow . Let 's go headfirst . Piga , did you get the egg ? The bees are killing their queen . He bites like a ferret . Found this under the pig . The letters are so even . Let 's go . Now , now . You , stinker , remember 40 years ago ? Yes , like that , like that . You called my book the poop of the Siu bird . - I don 't remember . - Don 't you ? Hey , what are you doing ? Forty years of life . My whole life . It 's OK , you made it in time ! Now you 're going for a walk ? Let go , Saanez ! The tube is ours . They stuck a wise guy into the shit-house down there . His feet did this , then he went " glub-glub . " I was there , such a laugh ! Return the flute to the Don . You bastard ! You have to be careful with money . Bring it to him yourself , prankster , or else I 'll sell you at the port . Don . You thief ! It 's the same every fall . Don 't know what to say . It 's the same . Noble Don , give the cripple a coin ! The wind has changed , now it smells like rot . The city was surrounded by fetid bottomless Pitanian swamps . Still , people , like the drowned bookworm , crept to Irukan at nights . There were Arata , the Hunchback 's rebel peasants or the refugee slaves from the tin mines , transparent like moths , or Colonel Kusis 's Gray soldiers . You pay or you die . All because they used to create a second nature to decorate the life of people who know no beauty . Or to create glass that helped the half-blind to see and the ones who saw to approach the sky . Don Rumata hid clover clogs here to sneak into Arkanar . What are you doing ? We 're learning to fly , mostly downward . Noble Don , take me from here . What a delight ! Budakh the Doctor was to be brought here from Irukan . He was a sober and logical mind created by this civilization . A good interlocutor for Rumata in the long evenings at Arkanar . But Budakh disappeared together with the guards . Here 's Pekh , the iron-tailed beast . You 're lying . There 's no such thing . It 's turnip . Turnip . Exhale ! He is lying ! You even got the birds drunk ! Now I 'll kill him ! Hit ! Hit him ! Bastard . Kill him ! If you ever brew that slop again . Why is it so depressing ? - Because it 's fall . - Yeah . Fall again ? It is white . Unbearable ! Look ! Can you believe that idiot synthesized alcohol ? That toad ! The first on this planet ! Leonardo da Vinci . Earthlings gathered here more rarely now . They drank more and more and got mad at each other . I love you ... but you don 't love me . The hell with all those presidents , kings , get out of the way ! I adopted a boy . He 's alone , I 'm alone . The boy is a thief . He 's an orphan , bastard ! Now there 's two of us . I saw Earth again in my sleep . It 's wonderful . Welcome here ! Your guy Budakh disappeared . And the officer too . They will kill him . I 'll get Budakh . Give me this shovel . The boy volunteered to snitch . On his own . Tell him to shut up . Clear ? Like this . Hey , you old fart ! Give me a kiss ! You 've got ants in your mouth . Here , eat that ! A trap , I said . How many times have I told you ! Pashka got caught in a trap ! A boar trap ! Don 't set your foot - In order to remove this trap it 's necessary to cut the leg also ! Give me a knife . It hurts , you jerks ! You want some poison ? A fine one ! Listen , all ! Twenty years ago - Twenty years ago one of us ... an idiot , called " Renaissance " the triumph of art here ! On this shitty planet ! I laughed . And you wrote that I 'm an ass . Maybe I am . But where 's the art ? And the Renaissance ? Not here . - And the whole life , eh ? - My mistake . Sorry , my bad . Listen , everyone . I came here without guards . I was attacked by a runaway slave . He choked me , see . That 's just a zit . I have to go back alone . An arrow in the eye will kill me ! And you don 't want to forgive me before my death ! He doesn 't want to forgive me before my death ! Come on , let 's kiss ! This scumbag has a whole crew of guards . - What a liar ! - I 'm Munchhausen . What would you do without me ? Strange fools on a strange planet ? Where is the leather bag ? The bird Siu cries over there . Your fucking Renaissance is the most vile age in the history of the Earth ! Zurab , that 's better . " It 's dark and quiet . Not to me , to someone else . " Well ? " Not to me , to someone else . " A wet umbrella rustled in . " - Do you want it ? - Get lost ! Look . Are you crazy ? You creep ! You creep ! The Siu bird , never seen , steals silver . And the servants get punished . Is that fair ? That bird doesn 't exist , you fool ! Muga saw its shadow ! What are you saying ? Nobody saw it but Muga . Wonderful , only there 's no happiness yet . Slave , like this or this ? The rope noise scares the birds ... and they fly to the swamp . If you put scales on the head ... they peck the eyes out . One tobacconist , a very smart man , he - Slave , like this or this ? Master , I 'm not going any further . It 's too hard . You 'll keep going , or I 'll flog you . Master , you 're kind , 'cause you 're a god . I will surely ﬂog you , you 'll think it 's a nightmare . When I die , don 't throw me into the gulf . Bury me in the ground . Even if it 's in the barn ! This Don Arata the Hunchback is just a clot of swamp fog . I was always sure . They took the relics of your holy father out . Arata and all his drunk peasants melted too . - So , am I a bad poet ? - An awful one ! " Falls on my soul like an autumn leaf . " " Prince and Barbarian girl . " - I have the book . - I burned it . How stupid of you ! Give it to me . The archer is drunk , remove him ! And the monk tells you - We 're the young aristocracy . They did the right thing by drowning Bota in the crap-house for such poetry . Not me ! You think his poetry 's bad ? Did the prince cry today ? - My good crossbowman ! - Insolent slave ! Budakh didn 't go through my office . Colonel Kusis left the army . He and Don Reba are in the lilac chambers . Speaking that lousy language . Incredible ! Show him the holy relics of my father . Maybe he 'll disappear . No one disappears , neither Arata , nor that one . - I thought it interested you . - It interests me a lot . He 's the captain of the crown guard . He has blood on his hands . On his whole body ! It has always been like this and like this it will be . That 's the rule . And so it goes . Noble Don ... my whole body stinks . Will I die ? Of course you will die . Charming . Fear of death is a heresy , Captain . Here . Bota the Great also stunk because he was so drunk , he peed on himself . - The savages also stunk . - What are you doing ? Do you seriously think you 're a son of God ? " The murmurs ebb ; Onto the stage I enter . I am trying , standing in the door . " - You 're Red ! - " The murmurs ebb ... onto the stage I enter . I am trying , standing in the door , to discover in the distant echoes - The nocturnal darkness with a thousand - ... Who wrote that ? I did ! " " Nocturnal darkness " is an evening . I can teach you something . For money . Crown Security Minister , Don Reba ! - Allow me ? - Away , away . Don Reba , our eagle . Crown security . He delivered ice for my dad . Barefoot . Rumata , whose son are you ? Let me have a sip . Ask your dad not to turn my wine sour . Damned bastard ! Your Majesty . You haven 't eaten ? Who are you ? A butcher ? Orders of Don Reba . It 's you ? I 'm a colonel , a financier . They 've stuffed the castle with Gray thugs . Where 's Arata the Hunchback ? He 's become a mirage ? So great and glorious like eternity , the king whose name - Out ! All on the ground ! I hit the nostril . Redhead ! - Now I 'll hang myself . - No way . Do you smell the stink ! Don Reba . You should stop by for a wash . I have these comfortable huge iron barrels . No , you come over ! I have great barrels in the Tower of Joy . On coals , with lids . Without water . Perfect barrels for the torture ! Rumata ! You really are a redhead . Reba , you 've been promising to strangle him . You 're a liar , and not good at anything . - He has royal blood . - You should have known that ! What is it ? He 's good at everything . He 's strangled half of your subjects . I summoned this doctor , Budakh . For my knee pain . What 'd he do with him ? You have knee pain too ? What ? It says here . Knight Don Reba , our eagle . They sell it all over at Arkanar . - You are a knight ? - Yeah . - What are you saying ? - Whatever they say . I don 't know . Show me your boot . The spur . Take it off ! - Where 's your doctor ? - The knight has him ! Not in a barrel , I hope . Bring him here . He 'll answer without inquest . You 'll have a laugh ! Bloodsuckers fall from the ceiling . And she 's slippery . Keeps slipping off . No good . - Try a barbarian girl . - No way ! She 'll bite it off . It happened to one , before he had a big one . Here , it 's a gift . You 'll tell me later . Here 's Budakh . Here 's Budakh . You always find something wrong . And he won 't be Budakh . I 'm not good at anything ! It wasn 't Budakh . It was a quack from a plague port . You 're not Budakh . And not a doctor ! He has your letter too . Don Rumata . You signed it . Why drink ? Everyone rubs . Why drink , Rumata ? You drink ! Out ! He should be strangled . Redhead , you said ? Remember , tonight you 're on watch by the Prince 's chambers . The crossbow 's broken . How do I go on now ? Play what I taught you . The donkeys lift their tails . Autumn . A wagon with wood and with fish . The dog sprouted . It keeps raining . Don , buy it , for the sword . - Right . - What ? There . Hold it like that .

No peeing in the carriage ! They keep peeing in the carriage . Who thought of it ? I hear there 's going to be a massacre tonight . They 'll kill the wise guys . They left the old man behind . A very smart man , a tobacconist from Tobacco Street . A very smart man . Swine , take the chickens , if not , that one will steal and eat them . Master ! Master ! Water . Saint Mika drowned in water . A tobacconist from Tobacco Street . A very smart man said - - What is it ? - Want to end up in the cholera pit ? Who did I tell about germs ? I 'll show you . Can 't wash sins away with water . I prayed three times last night . I 'll drown you in the barrel , you stinker . Get back ! Give me some water . Muga , the fish has a crush on you ! A double lunch ? Here it is ! So the tobacconist from Tobacco Street is a very wise man . He said it . Well . Did anyone else see it ? - Everyone saw it . - It 's his fault . - You knocked and I opened . - It 's like that ! Master , sell it ! - The Gray guys are coming this way . - Excellent ! Go on and wash yourselves . Everyone ! And no laughing ! - A turtle . - Yes . Nonsense . Why ? What do you mean , why ? Yeah , it 's like that . I didn 't invite him . - Sit down . - It 's raining outside . No , don 't sit down . Everything 's wet , it 's raining . What 's wrong ? Sit down . Take my ear . Squeeze it hard . Harder ! Harder ! If it hurts , I won 't think and I 'll tell you . Brother came from the barracks yesterday . Started yelling that I have red hair . He lifted my dress . He showed soldiers what it 's like down there . He yelled that my morn is a redhead and he 'll send me to the Tower of Joy . Brother is a commander of a pack of Grays . No , it bothers me ! Did they touch you ? No , he wanted to do something like in your drawing , but no . He was too drunk ! They brought in a wise guy at night . And kept beating him . He screamed . Dad and I cried in the barn . And now - - Her bag was like this . And now it 's this ! - Go away , you stinker ! I see , but it feels like I can 't see . Why are you wearing my boots ? They 'll sell you at the port . Stop ! Bend over ! Don 't beat me ! Ah , you slashed me ! - I 'm dying . - Here 's a coin for you . Who 's beating you ? I 've never laid a finger on them . I 've never laid a finger on them . - And I will do it . - I never even touched you , moron ! Hear how he 's screaming ? I never touched him and he 's screaming ! - He 's a cunning idiot . - Look at him . What do you want ? - Take it . - What ? It stinks . The eye ... I 've cried . The soldiers did it to me . Fuck you ! - Who stuck this in here ? Why ? - OK , I 'm going . Where 're you going ? I 've stolen enough . If you leave - If you leave - If you leave , my friend - Don Reba - I 'll be all alone . Not counting you , pretty boy . Because here I am the strongest , I can crush anyone . I never told you about the fangs ? If I could only give them to you ! No one would ever hurt you again . You would have devoured anyone ! What an idiot ! Here it is ... the flap . I was afraid you didn 't have one , like St. Goran . Silence ! I 'll have Goran 's grandson in my belly , that will be my fangs ! The key is mother 's , not mine ! Here , please ! Goran fell ! It 's my mother 's Goran ! - What ? - We 're almost there . - You 're lying ! - What ? You think it 's funny ? Yes ! A game ! What ? Where 's the bolt ? Your grace , someone saw a dude with gills in the creek . What 's that ? Well ? - You see ? - No , I don 't see . But you look - Baron ? What 's wrong ? I don 't drink . I only sniff now . Baron , are you ill or mad at me ? I 'm depressed . The Grays are like bedbugs . Baron . What 's that ? St. Gaj 's toilet . I 've invited the neighbors , they really got drunk . Come here , my friend . No , Baron . I 'm a foreigner . I can 't do that . Here 's a young one . Come here , you ! The neighbors came . They piss everywhere . They mutilate the dogs . They say that you broke Soan 's armor in two . Just rumors . Don 't believe it , Baron . - Enough . I 'm so depressed . - Shall I take you home ? The Soanians are tiny and their armor is fragile . It 's all about sharpening the sword . I 'll teach you . I 'm the Empire 's best swordsman , you 're better than me . You never kill anyone . Where do I get a Seaman sword ' ? They 've brought the Baroness 's grandfather 's armor . It 's huge . I tried everything to break it . No luck ! Then the Baroness saw me . Then - Then she really let me have it ! It 's all in the grinding . I 'll show you . It 's easy . Just find the middle , OK . You swing from your wrist . I 'll push from the shoulder . Nothing else . Like this . - Take it and lower it and that 's it ! - Baroness - She thinks I 'll rot in the water here . You won 't rot . Wow , look at this ! Nice and heavy , eh ? It was the wind . That 's funny ! These tablecloths are clean . You can vomit on them . Can you fight with this ? Everything will be all right . Baron , I beg you . Let 's do it together . Hold the wrist tightly and put weight on the shoulder . Noble Dons , this is a very expensive armchair . It 's also Grandfather 's ! Now it 's clean . Yes , in two ! Hold it ! He won 't make it . No way ! - First it seemed like - - Yes ? Get out of here . Sorry , my friend . It 's just my job ! The Baroness can 't see this . You 'll crush me , Baron . What is it ? That 's all , that 's all . Pah , the Gray thugs . They 're everywhere , like fleas . The milk ! The port 's closed . There 's meat rotting in the galleys . I have a secret for you . That doctor , in the king 's castle . He 's not Budakh . He 's actually needed at the cholera pit at the port . And where 's Budakh ? Fish like milk . No , Noble Don , fish don 't like milk . - Fish like milk . - I 'm telling you , fish don 't like milk . - Fish like milk . - No . Let 's just agree that fish like milk . I 'm the captain of crown guard . It doesn 't matter what your Baron , that beer gut , says . I have a troop of haberdashers for him ! Yeah , you 'll always have the haberdashers from the colonies . Until the end of time ! Fish like milk . Fish like milk . They like milk ! Wait . Wait . Where 's Fika , the redheaded butcher ? Go away , boy . You 're a god ! And if I was a god ? If I am , then why is my name on your arrest list ? You 're a god , a real god ! Where 's Fika , the redheaded butcher ? There 's a soul , or there 's no soul . I 've stolen some ham . I said it was for you . It 's great . Listen : " An impotent and inept one - " " An impotent and inept one will give up without knowing , where the octopus 's heart is and if it has one . " - Are these bad lines ? - No , not bad ! What do you have that I don 't ? They gave you a chef ? Go buy a barrel of wine . Don 't come near me . Or you 'll end up in the Tower of Joy , and you 'll die on the way out of fear ! Get out of the city ! - I 'll go stay with my mother . - Go away ! Baron ! I 'm not going to let you pass ! Baron , Baron ! Everyone get out ! You 've broken the 3rd commandment ! Quiet ! Which one ? " You mustn 't fight with swords in a tavern ! " . But I - Go home . Quick ! Good thing the Baroness can 't see me now ! Victory ! Write her . I can 't . She 's all alone there . Wine and whores for everyone ! I 'll just have the old ones and decent ones . I 'm distressed ! Write her so she can feel it all . Arata ! A very strict officer . Very strict . Go back ! You can 't pass through here . He 'll hit us . He 's a very strict officer . It 's cold .

Ears really hurt , you should believe me ! Go fuck yourself ! Come here . If you swing the sword from the right - The hair 's in the way . And it 's because it 's the right hand . Let me go . That 's horrible . I know where you got your combat technique ! The finger , it 's better to lift it . Inhuman technique ! You 're a fool . Show me your ears . You 're scared . I 'm not scared of anyone . You 're scared . Help here ! Humble children of the order landed last night at the Arkanar port . 30,000 of them ! No more conceited Grays . Arata the Hunchback 's men are hung by the tracts ! Allow me to introduce myself : I 'm the vicar of the order . Combat master of Lands Beyond the Strait . Of the islands , etc . Great . - What ? - The master 's boot . You were on the edge of such a fiery abyss . You don 't even know . See ? Look . - Come on , that 's a boot . - Does it stink ? Such a trifle . You understand . A man comes to you every night . For 7 years now ! That 's a lie ! You even called for a witch doctor . But you can 't get rid of him ! You wrapped your head in a piece of hide . But that 's heresy ! When man opens his eyes ... and looks at you . Right ? Nonsense . He opens his eyes . And he says - Sir , you mustn 't ! And you scream so loud that your old lady pees herself ! That 's right ? Come here . Her pants ! That man ... with the eyes ... that 's me ! That 's me ! Go away . A larger pan . Boots . The spur 's bent . Maybe the abyss belched you out .

Three hundred kilos of shit ! Yes . So I can sleep well . Can you explain why you need these people ? They 're useless and bad for any state . The bookworms ? See , I 'm speaking to you . But that doesn 't mean we 're having a conversation . Why did you serve such rotten food ? Go away ! Your belongings , Don . Any food is good , even fish . That was the order . Its humble children . 200 or so years ago the order owned the Lands Beyond the Strait . Luckily , a plague sucked the order dry . It was now rotting away in the south . But then it got better . It was here now . Ruthless like Brazilian ants . Rumata thought about sending at least Muga there . But didn 't get around to it . You have so much stuff ! You have so much stuff . Have some milk , Don . Gur , you were the brightest . Move away ! Wage ! The wheel 's gone . What are you saying ? What the hell ! Are you out of your mind ? Perfect ... yes , yes . " Like autumn leaves - ... Your autumn leaves clutter the scaffold . Yes , the boots , the spur is bent . Peck the eyes out or no , what does it matter ? Eh , doesn 't matter if it gets pecked out . Nice place . You want me to hang the poet over here ? Don ! I recognized you right away . Branded by the monks . I belong to you now ! Don 't be mad , Don . Have the potato . You 've heard how many ears I 've cut off ? - Yes , we 've heard . - It hurts . Give me that umbrella . Ear , ear ! It 's funny ! A right ear . An adult man , eh ! I 'm going to dry myself and then I 'll give it back . Let me go . That 's wrong . Don 't do that . Yes . Close it . He 's been on the chain since he was 3 . Why ? You let him go - he 'll die . Here ! Why I 'll be - Stop ! I said , stop ! Say you fell . That you weren 't born with that lip . Remember that . Don 't hide anything . Blame the redheads . Don 't argue with anyone . Listen to me ! You think you 're the only one . Learn this ! A scholar is not the enemy . The enemy is a scholar in doubt . Remember ! In the name of the order ! In its name ! You 'll kill him , Don . In the name of the order . What is it ? All the ribs . Let the Noble Dons in . We 're killing whores . She 'll spread her legs , and this thing is on a spring . Rips them to pieces ! She didn 't have time to cough . The order ! How much did she pee ! With spurs . Noble Don ! Where did you get your hands ? Waga will be released ? What a delight , what a delight for everyone . Wipe off my temple . What 's going on here ? Get out ! A thought entered his head and settled there for good . Don Reba must be killed ! Just kill him and not think about the consequences . What 's going on here ? We 're flogged here , Rumata ! Where 's your sword ? Did you hand it in , Noble Don ? I see . I have this shrub . It blossomed . So beautiful ! It 's a sign ! When I was little , Don Reba gave me rides on a shovel , in the winter . See how easy it is to breathe in the new , free Arkanar . And wine 's cheaper now too ! - Leave me alone . - Eat this . They put salt on the flogging rods . And what ? Why ? What 's the salt for ? Is it better now , in the new liberated Arkanar ? I 've lost the notice . If only I hadn 't lost it ! Here . Stick it up your ass . Your ass , not this one ! Try to make sure the hangman sees it . - Stop , I said . - Forever , Rumata . Take off your hat . The Keu barons always had privileges ! There are no privileges for the order . 7 heavy rod whips ! - Why heavy ones ? - For thoughts without enthusiasm . Give me Budakh . It 'll do it . Here 's your doctor . Good . You remember about the ears , right ? Oh , yeah . Leave it to me ! Everyone steals it . It 's not necessary . The Dons have funny asses . Like toads ! Like your face ! It 's good like this , right ? - Don , again - - Go to hell ! - So good that I found you . - Baron , but I found you ! Why are you so - It hurts . A courtier , Baron ... must be clean and fragrant . Right ? What 's wrong ? What 's wrong , Baron ? My nose burst . I 'm so glad I found you . When you were arrested , I fled here . There were 1000 Blacks here . I beat them until - Then they threw a cow on me . From the bridge . - The leg , Baron . - I 'll push . How their crummy skulls will crack under our baronial swords ! Let 's go , Barons . Here . Budakh , not Rudakh . Good and alive . Eating for the road . Looks OK , and the teeth are intact . Are you Budakh from Irukan ? Baron , this is Budakh . He is - - I turned him in . - Why ? Baron ! First , because he has a dog 's name . Then - Second ... wait . - What second , Baron ? - I did something wrong . And this ! Till the very end , 20 years . My whole life . Now I come to eat . The hell with you . The hell with you . Baron ! If I only had a nail file - You 'll crush me ! Bau ba ... Baron , the stuff is right there , on the left . Go be a soldier , son . Don 't look , Irukano ! Who let them ﬂog him , Baron or Noble Don ? Baron , your stuff ! - Fire from the sky ! - Stop farting ! Smelly ! Stop ! My noble friend , are my legs really skinny and white now ? Nice , nice legs . Why are you sniffing me ? - Trying to be a thinker ? - Here I am . - The forehead is also beautiful . - I 'm such a baron , you know . And you 're a brainbox . He 'll teach me to read . Then I 'll be wise too . But you 'll never be a baron . If you get sick , they 'll punish me . Forgive me ... bau ba ... My friend , give him money . Lots of it . The ribs are still not healed . They 'll close the gates and we 're dead . We 'll go back . - They 'll open it right back . - Don 't do this , I beg you ! But if you get sick - Show me that lieutenant , who is so worried about my health . Go away ! Such a turkey . Buy an eye . It reflects light . The knife was a gift . Recently I saw your Waga . - Help ! - Where are you going , asshole ? Where are the asshole archers ? Eating turnip ? There . Such fun again . The sword , my friend . Where are the archers ? I 'll die laughing ! Hey , Baron , you won 't learn to read now . I can 't teach you . I 'll pee in my pants . No way now . Baron Pampa del Bao-no of Arkanar . He wasn 't tried by the Big Royal Court or killed by the poison of the bee , or executed in a square . He was just pierced with a dozen arrows and dumped . Rotten turnips were dumped on top of him . At night , paupers will rip everything off his huge , strong white body . - Leave me alone . - Without the horse ? He 's pulling the cord on purpose . Where did we stop , Budakh ? It 's impossible to talk like this . Why without the horse ? I ask questions , you don 't answer . I asked you . What would you do if you were God ? - I wouldn 't have any urine problems . - Go to hell ! Damn it , they won 't let us talk . Pee ! Pee all you need , and then we 'll talk . It 's important not to stare . Go there . Relax . And if you could give advice to a god ? If he asked for it ? That wouldn 't be heresy , right ? I 'd say : Creator ! Why Dee on my boots ? You came and we 're leaving . Someone killed two slaves over there . It wasn 't us . We 're officers of the order . We 're off to sleep . You got it , brainbox . That one is still - Let him be . I 'd say , " Creator ! Give people everything that separates them . " No ! That won 't do them any good . Because the strong will take from the weak . It 's empty - I 'd say , punish the cruel so the strong will know not to be cruel . The strong and cruel will be punished . The stronger of the weak will take their place . You know that . You 're a fool , Budakh . Get out of here . I don 't need you . Why do you get angry with me ? Get out of here ! I 'm going to spray ... this acid on you , so you won 't have a face ! I 'd say , " Creator , if you exist , blow us away . Blow us away . Like dust or pus . " Or leave us in our rot . Destroy us all . " Here . It 's easy to destroy . The Blacks , the lice-ridden , and even the children . My heart is full of pity . I can 't do that . OK . Let 's go home . There were many Grays . The slave was wearing your shirt . He shot from the stairs . Your shirt was big on him . The Grays put a noose around his neck and strangled him . And then the Blacks came and killed the Grays . One Black gave me this . See , don 't touch it . - Why ? - Don 't touch ! Don 't touch ! See that ? They told me to come to the Tower of Joy tomorrow . - Why did you take it ? - They gave me this . So I 'd come tomorrow . Tomorrow . - Give it to me ! - Give it back . Don 't touch ! He ruined the cucumbers . He was hiding ... in the cucumber barrel , in the brine . Parasite ! He peed on himself . Master ! I had a horse . - There 's just this clamp left . - Throw it away . Everyone , get out . I 'm going to wash my ass . I 'm going to put it here for a while . I 'm distressed ! Weren 't you hanged ? - How could I come if I were ? - How did you come , Arata ? Arata the Hunchback ! My back . - Goran likes cripples . - Are you a cripple ? First my guys trusted this virgin . - Give me . - This old bitch ! - He is the don of peasants ! - He is more important ! Sausage - And then they trusted monks . They now hang them by the balls on the same trees . I almost forgot you 're a god ! That 's too bad . Your water is cold . Make some hotter water ! Once I was being hanged on the port . I jumped off just in time and ran away . One of them was ... - a captain . - Yes ? He was kind . Angel ! Come here ! Don 't stare . Let it be . One 's too much for you . - I knew a while back that God died ! - Come on , really ? He pulled this load , like a horse . Then he got snotty ... and died . There 's no other way ! It 's hard for a god . It 's hard . I saw you getting snotty today . Wasps ! It 's a joke . I have bad news for you . Today you 'll give us the fiery chariot and these shirts . And in the morning you 'll lead us ! - Or else - - What ? Or else ... the navel on your white belly will be the right place to drill ! My navel . All right . - I 'm afraid it won 't be easy . - It will be easy . That was a bird . That 's an omen . For money . - You 'll fly to your daddy . - Everyone will fly one day . Like birds . Get out . Will we have enough water ? Somebody , hold my wallet . Not much you can do , brother . Leave the ring . Give it to me . Not this . I wouldn 't kill you . You don 't know that ! You 're so dressed up . - How was the trip here ? - OK . I won 't get you the throne . That is the truth . That was right . I 'd burn the gold and black vermin . As far as 12 generations back . That you 're good at ! That you 're good at ! And you 'd give the land out to your own . - Right ? - Yes . Who 's come ? A scholar . I know him . He 's an idiot . - Pour again ! - It happens . Pour , pour . What is it ? A man 's skin is made up of tiny holes . They breathe too . If you cover a man with tar , he will die . That 's for you . Good boy , Arata ! Without it , they won 't let you out of the city . Tell me - Tell me , Arata ! So you give the land to your men . Who needs the land without slaves ? Who needs it without slaves ? There 'll be new slaves . New scaffolds . New Blacks . Everything will begin from scratch . There 'll be a new Arata . And God can 't do anything . That 's sad ! I 'll never allow it to happen ! Quiet now . You won 't be able to do anything . You 'd allow everything , everyone did and always will . For thousands of years . What do we do ? The same as always . The same as always . One , two ... the end . You 're a redheaded bastard . Muga ! Introduce him to your tobacconist ! They 'll make good friends ! Chase him with sticks through the barnyard . Hey . Don ! All right . OK . So what 'll happen to me ? You 'll remain in songs . That 's it ? That 's not really that little . Believe me ! Out ! Master ! The Blacks are asking for the sign . I knew it , this is the end . Let 's cut some ears ! Stop shaking . Let me eat . My arm hurts . Want some ? Go away , old man . You 'll go with me . You 'll confirm there 's a boy in my belly . Goran 's grandson ! Already ? I won 't go without pants . And all my pants are wet now . You 'll go ! 18 generations of noble ancestors . Royal blood , and no pants ! Give me dry pants and I 'll go to war . I don 't want to be covered with lard and burned . Like a chicken . So don 't go ! Ferret ! All right ! I 'll chase them into the gulf . Up to their asses . I promise . I 'm sorry you didn 't know Baron Pampa . Forget it ! You could at least clean the house ! - Did you find any ? - No . Yes , here . Silly girl ! The turtle was eating mice in the pants . I found some . And the turtle too . - Laces . - What ? Laces ? What ? Did you find my swords , silly girl ? Blood is sticky . OK . There . God , if you exist , stop me ! Run ! God decided to start killing . My swords ! Where are you going ? Stop Arima ! Look ! Arima . My name is Arima . My name is Arima . That 's no problem . Then - - I didn 't bring everyone . - They 'll all be punished . Some strange monk did ! I saw him . With a walleye . Kill them all ! Look , or I 'll flog you to death ! I 'm the eye of the order . It 's a mistake . It was some strange monk ! Is it blood ? It smells . What ? The Creator gave us pain . I went to university too . I am Arima . I 'm the eye of the order . The roads are slippery . I 'll kill everyone here . You too , student ! Heresy ! - Heresy ! - Get out of here ! The boots ! What ? I didn 't take anything ! I didn 't take anything ! The hat of sorrow ! Nobody steals under the order . I 'll kill everyone ! God , stop me . Like it 's not me ! Not everyone 's destined . I can 't either . I feel nauseous . It 's just ... why . Here , a gift for you . Have a look . Summons to the office . The Tower of Joy . It 's something serious . - He 's here too . - What did I do ? - I never left the house . Confirm ! - Out ! Death and life . Life . And life again . I 've been outside today . Here . Your destiny . Nun from Tm Street . Defamation of the order . That 's serious , something about you too . You can pardon them all , Don . Why don 't you give me , stupid Don ... 200 more street luvvies ? You 'll find someone else to burn . Isn 't it the same for you ? Isn 't that right , student ? You can 't ! Stop ! Put the boards down . Who wants water ? Above ! - Ribs ! - Broken . Another chain . Rock him ! So the shit drips off ! A student . " An impotent and inept one will give up . Will give up ... without knowing where the monster 's heart is , if the monster even has one . " Don , I think I 've gone blind ! An officer ! It squelches here . It always squelched here . But not like this ! You 're so awkward ! Stop , or I 'll wound you . It 's slippery . Hi . What might be ... nothing might be . You 'll pee ! - Again ! - You 'll pee ! An egg ! Flies . Here ! This is Arata the Hunchback . So , walleyed man ! You bastard . He 's decomposed by now . Why didn 't you spare the young girl ? He - The Head of Cows . - His arrow is marked ! - This is the boar Yi mark ! - It 's the boar ! - This is a cow , I tell you ! This is the boar Yi ! It 's the boar ! - Go away ! - Leave him , he 's suffered enough . This is the boar Yi ! Arata killed the girl ! The mark on the arrow is the same . He wanted to draw Rumata out ... against the Blacks . But drew him against himself ! Another egg . I 'll call him ! You , witch ! It 's squelchy here ! You owe me a coin , Condor ! I saw it first ! Condor , there 's something shiny over there . What ? I 'm not flying to Earth with you . No , nothing shiny . I 'm not ! Pashka ! You 'll be sorry if you go behind my back ! Well . See what I learned here ? If you say no , then no . But , you know that ? Well , you old ass . All this is not my work , it 's yours . - You fucking theorist . - You 're crap ! - Why are you here ? - The crap of the Siu bird . You 're set in a nuthouse on Earth . - Or maybe in jail . - And you are a thief ! Or maybe you even have a brain tumor ! - You are a thief ! - The crap of the Siu bird ! There are snakes there ! Here , take this ! He 's a thief , and you keep throwing gloves . Pashka , we 're dueling . It 's come to this ! A god can be tired too . Practical like hell ! Get out of here ! I 'm sleepy - You write books , but you have no thoughts . Here 's one . Where Grays triumph - Wait . Where Grays triumph , Blacks always , always come in the end . There is no way . Remember ! And now leave . Wait ! If you write about me ... and you 'll probably have to , write that - that it 's hard ... to be a god . And I 'll get some sleep . God , spit on me , so I won 't ever be sick . And spit in my hand too . I 'll take it to my brother . Leave me alone ! God ! Come on , a kid won 't speak in vain . He doesn 't look at me . - Come on , look at me ! - Stop hovering ! Look at me ! These university guys . They kept running around the tower , screaming . The fat one didn 't want to fly . Stronger than beer . Don Leonardo and Don Fatso . They killed each other . Here . Why ? You bastards ! That Don Leonardo . They drank away the round glass and the boards . So what ? Muga , what does your tobacconist say ? Where is he ? Left his house ... and never came back . It happens . Will you find him ? I told you to take the stocks off . Why don 't you take them off ? I 'll remove them immediately . - Have you gone mad ? - I slipped . I also left my house a long time ago ... like him . And never came back . Out of the way , Noble Don ! Or the wheel will get your boot . Hey , you forgot the chair , fools ! Do you like this music ? I don 't know . It makes my tummy hurt . Yes . A special thanks for assistance in creating this film goes to Alexei Kudrin , Mikhail Prokhorov .

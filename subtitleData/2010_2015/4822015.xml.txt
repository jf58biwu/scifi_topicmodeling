 ( Bird chirps ) ( beeps ) Man : And we 're rolling , sir . ( Birds chirping ) Note that this time , the X0-359 had a spontaneous reaction to the impurities released by the cigarette smoke . This is- - this is very good . This is a very good sign of progress . ( Beeping ) My God . Carbon monoxide , zero . Ammonia , zero . Nitrogen dioxide , zero . All airborne impurities were completely eliminated in a matter of seconds . This is ... This is astonishing . The plant has created pure air . ( Groans ) I don ' ! know , okay ? It doesn 't look like anyone 's dumping today . I thought you were committed to catching these polluters , Mr. Not-Gonna-Happen-On-My-Watch . Yeah , I am . I am . But that was before my leg fell asleep and my obsessive girlfriend deprived me of food . Some bastard is egregiously polluting this mine with toxic waste . Look , if we don 't catch them in the act , Joe , they 're gonna ruin this whole area . There 'll be acidic seepage in the drinking water , and wildlife will start dying off , and- - I know , I know . Okay . I 'm sorry . Joe : I don 't know what I was thinking . - ( Vehicle approaching ) - Hey , we 've got company . ( Unzips bag ) Joe : We got you now , buddy . ( Beeps ) ( birds chirping ) Woman : He looks nervous . Here , come on . Kyle . It 's good to see you again . Joe : Aguy in a suit coming out of a mine ? You gotta be kidding me . Something 's wrong with this picture , all right . You came alone , right ? ( Scoffs ) What does it look like ? Keep focused , Kyle . The sooner you show me the product , the sooner we can get out of here . - That the money ? - ' Course . Show me . This guy 's definitely not dumping waste . Well , whatever 's going on doesn 't look kosher . You think it 's drugs ? We 'll see soon enough . Now you show me something . Relax . It 's a demonstration . ( grunting ) Why 'd that guy cut himself ? M-maybe this is , like , some secret cult gathering or something . I doubt that . That guy in a suit looks like a federal agent . I 'm impressed . Do you have the seed ? Wait here . Whoa . - There 's a sniper up there . - Where ? Right there on the platform . - Oh , my God . - What ? He spotted us . Man on radio : Sir , I 've got eyes on two bogeys . - Where ? - 10 : 00 , behind the concrete block . ( grunts ) Who are your friends , Kyle ? Oh , my Revs - You trying to set us up ? What are you talking about ? - You wearing a wire ? - No . Let me go . Give me the seed . Joe : He 's not looking . Whoa . All right , let 's get out of here . Man on radio : Sir , they 're on the move . Do I take them out ? KY leg Man on radio : Take out primary target . ( Panting ) - ( gunshot , yells ) - Was that a gunshot ? ( gasps ) Oh , my God . They shot him . ( Groans ) ( ground vibrating ) What is that ? Joe : An earthquake . What ? ( grunts ) Woman : Let 's get out of here ! ( yells ) Ah- - slower , please . You might damage the specimen . There you are . Aren 't you remarkably well-preserved ? Specimen 37 is bell-shaped . Slightly charred . With signs of extensive hydrolysis . Preliminary analysis leads me to believe it 's Helianthus annuus . Another sunflower seed . Look , I don 't see anything . Oh , my God . That was crazy . Joe , what the heck was that ? I don 't know . I 've never seen anything like that before . It looked like some kind of giant root , right ? I don 't know . But whatever just happened , people have to know about it . ( Helicopter approaching ) Well , it looks like someone 's on it . ( ground rumbling ) You gotta be kidding me . Joe : Watch out . Get in the car . Get in the car . Joe : Kate ! Joe : Kate , get in the car ! Kate , get in the car . Now ! ( Birds chirping ) Sir ... Noel , I 've asked you to move slowly when you 're in the garden . Plants are very sensitive . Sir , you need to see the news . Newscaster : You are seeing live footage of what appear to be gigantic roots devastating the remote deserts of Nevada . I just verified one of the seed stock is missing . And I couldn 't find Kyle . He 's not on the premises . Damn him . Those seeds weren 't ready to be released into an uncontrolled environment . ( thunder rumbling ) Woman : Who are these guys ? Where do they think they 're going ? Woman : Hey , buddy . No , stop ! ( Researchers clamoring ) Man : Hey , what are you doing ? Slop ! Slop ! What do you think you 're doing ? You just trampled over a prehistoric refuse pit . Isn 't it an old garbage dump ? Very old . Dr. Stein , I 'm Special Agent Jack Tompkins . We need you to come with us . It 's a matter of national security . National security ? Are you kidding ? - Did I do something wrong ? - Please get in the car . We don 't have much time to waste . Are you sure you have the right Dr. Stein ? I study plant remains . You may have knowledge pertaining to a geological catastrophe unfolding in Nevada . Now will you please get in the car ? Jeremy Frame and Matthew Kyle . When 's the last time you had contact with either one of these gentlemen ? Three years ago . Dr. Frame hired Kyle and I to work on a seed excavation in Turkey . What kind of seeds ? I don 't understand . What does this have to do with a geological disaster ? We have reason to believe this disaster could be man-made . Well , which is it ? Geological or man-made ? Could be both . What kind of seeds ? Seeds from the Garden of Eden . As in ... - the Garden of Eden . - That 's right . You seriously believe such seeds can exist ? I wouldn 't have spent my time looking for them if I didn 't . Okay . Frame found lost passages in the Dead Sea Scrolls indicating that , after Adam and Eve were banished from the garden , Adam stole seeds in an urn to replant a new garden . But a flood hit and the seeds were lost . Stein : So Frame got funding for me to dig in an unmapped area below the 11,000-year-old site of Gobekli Tepe , the prehistoric temple believed to be the location of Eden . ( Men speaking in foreign language ) I think we found something . Kyle : An intact Neolithic vessel . - This is amazing . - ( rattling ) Aren 't you dying to take a quick peek ? Don 't even think about it , Kyle . This can only be opened in an airtight lab . ( Rattling continues ) Unbelievable . ( phone ringing ) Stern : One week later , I got a call from Frame . ( Staticky voices ) Frame : Jocelyn , I 'm afraid we have some bad news . We 've lost our funding . Why ? What about the urn ? Frame : The um was empty . There was nothing inside . But there was . I heard something . It was just ... chipped pottery . Frame : I 'm truly sorry . Where 's Frame now ? I have no idea . He 's a bit of a recluse . I never knew where he was based . Do you know what Frame was planning on doing with these seeds ? Recreate the Garden of Eden . ( thunder crashing ) Oh , man . This isn 't good . No . Now what ? ( ground rumbling ) Joe . You 're in danger ! Go ! Get out of here now ! Get in , get in . Hold on . - What are you doing ? - Just hold on . Kate : Joe , where are you going ? This is crazy . ( tires squealing ) ( people clamoring ) ( yelling ) ( door closes ) What agency is this ? - Welcome to SCOPE . - SCOPE ? - Never heard of it . - We keep a low profile . Our mandate is to investigate threats that fall outside the scope of known science . Hence the catchy name . ( Office workers chattering ) Man : Got new data from Skynet 2 and Skynet 3 . - ( Phone beeping ) - You 're gonna have to put that away . Got real-time satellite imagery . Tompkins : You 're looking at infrared of Pershing County , Nevada . This is what 's going on right now ? Stein : What is it ? Tompkins : Our recon discovered massive root growth , spreading at a rate of up to 30 miles per hour , destroying everything in its path as we speak . And you think Kyle and Frame are responsible for this ? Yes , we do . Dr. Stein , I 'm Director Wilson . We picked up information that Frame was conducting what sounded like a preposterous experiment . Recreating the Garden of Eden using prehistoric seeds from the original garden in order to sanitize the planet . How did you get this information ? Our intel picked up correspondence between Kyle and an interested party . Seems your buddy 's trying to sell those ancient seeds on the black market . Well , that 's impossible . We never found the seeds . Unless- - Tompkins : So Frame lied to you . Any idea why he 'd want you off the project ? I don 't know . Where 's Kyle ? We don 't know where he is . But we are pursuing leads to his whereabouts . And what about Frame ? Well , we haven 't found him yet . His so-called Garden of Eden was being developed in a secret location somewhere in Nevada . - ( Camera whirrs ) - Joe 's voice : Kate , get in the car . Oh , my God . This ... This is surreal . - What are those things ? - I don 't know . I don 't know . I can 't believe we just saw all those people get killed . We need to go to the authorities and tell them what we saw happen at the mine . Look . We 're not going to the authorities , okay ? Those guys we saw at the mine , they looked like Feds . So what if this is some government test gone haywire ? I mean , what happens to us when powerful people try to cover their tracks ? A lot of people are getting killed . So until we know who 's involved , we don 't know who we can trust . Okay . If we do this , we go all the way . - Whatever it takes . - Yep . ( sighs ) All right , the first thing we need to do is we need to figure out where that van came from . ( Camera whirrs ) Kate : I have an idea . What do you want from me ? I 'm not saying we buy into this whole " Garden of Eden " thing . But if these seeds , in fact , are prehistoric and have something to do with it , we need to know . And right now you are our only lead . ( Workers chattering ) Incredible . I 've never seen a root system develop on such a massive scale before . Yeah , well , you 're not alone . At least the outbreak is in a remote area . Now , break it down for me . Give it to me in science-ese . Tompkins : Talk to me like I 'm five . A scientific explanation for what 's happening . I warned Frame there was a danger to awakening a prehistoric plant in today 's toxic world . Stein : I don 't have an explanation yet , but ... ( sighs ) you can 't ignore the warnings in the Bible . And I can 't formulate a game plan for fighting a disaster based on a fable . The Bible may be a fable to you , Agent Tompkins , but archeologists have found evidence that events it depicts have actually occurred throughout history . Jack , there 's a new development . You need to see this . G-L-9-4-3-X . - What 's that ? - License plate . - Kate : On the van . - Yeah ? Really ? Okay , well ... now we need someone to hack into the DMV . Both : Spit . Wilson : We were lucky until now , but the growth just picked up speed near Pyramid Lake . In less than three hours , this disaster 's gonna hit its first major city . Bob , Reno needs to be evacuated . - That 's not your call , Jack . - Well , then call the President . This thing is destroying everything in its path . The fatalities are gonna be staggering , Bob . Okay , we 're talking about evacuating half a million people in a matter of hours . Wilson : It can 't be done . You wanna save these people ? Stop the damn roots . ( Door slams ) I : Pit ! Pit ! - Spit , buddy . You in there ? - You there ? Hope the air in there is breathable this time . Yeah , don 't count on it . Spit . HEY - Hey , man . What are you guys doing here ? Don 't you know what 's going on ? Have you seen the freakin ' news ? Yeah , yeah . We know , man . We need your help . We need you to track a plate for us . Tompkins : Listen , we 're running out of time . This thing is effectively still just a plant , right ? So why don 't we kill it like you would a weed ? Dump a bunch of herbicide on it ? Herbicides work too slowly . The feeder roots are growing too fast and we 'd need thousands of gallons immediately . What 's a feeder root ? It 's the root tip , where the growth occurs . So if we cut the root tips leading to this thing , we can stop its growth . It could cripple the entire system . That 's what we 'll do . Sever the root tip . We 'd launch a surgical air strike , - we knock this thing out . - There 's a catch . If the root recovers , you risk having it regrow ... and multiply . We don 't have a choice . Get me the President . ( Cat meowing ) We don 't have much time here , Spit . You in yet ? Give me a minute , man . ( ground rumbles ) Oh , my God . Kate : Joe , you feel that , right ? Okay , come on , Spit , man . Let 's go . It 's coming . I 'm offline . I lost connection . - Well , we gotta go now . - No , we need that address . Can you get back on ? ( Mewing ) - Oh- - cable got knocked out . - Yes . Okay , we have to leave right now . Seconds away . Come on . We 're running out of time . - I 'm in . - Here . The plate number . ( Keyboard clicking ) G-L-9-4-3-X . Come on . Kate : Hurry , Spit . Spit : Almost there , Katie . Just a few seconds . Come on , come on . There 's your registrant and address . - Alamut Corp Industries . - Got it . ( Panting ) ( gasps ) - Let 's take my truck . - Go . Wait . I 've got to get my cat , man . - No , no , no ! No ! - No ! - Whoa . - Spit ! Whoa ! Spit . - Get in the truck . - Kate : Okay . This is Ace One . We 're 10 miles out and coming in low with 3-6-0 . Joe , look . Joe : Oh , my God . I think they 're gonna bomb it . We gotta get out of here . Pilot on radio : Approaching targets . ETA 60 seconds . Initiating separation . Kate : This doesn 't look good . We 're right in their line of fire . We have visual confirmation on target . Going weapons hot . Engaging in 20 seconds . Can 't this thing go any faster ? This thing 's an old piece of crap . Joe : I 'm flooring it already . I have missile lock . Pilot : Firing in five , four , three , two , one . Engage . Oh , my God . They 've fired . - Drive faster ! - I 'm trying to ! Pilot : Command , we have a direct hit . Waiting for debris to clear to verify destruction of targets . Have visual verification . Targets destroyed . I repeat , targets destroyed . ( Cheering ) Wilson : Okay , that 's a kill . Good work , everyone . - Nicely done . - Nice work , Jack . Poor Spit . All right . We 're gonna get these bastards . All right ? Joe : Whoever caused this . ( Computer beeping ) Jack ? Look at the screen . Patch me through to the lead pilot . ( Man dials ) Here , sir . - This is Director Wilson speaking . - Pilot : Yes , sir . I need another visual confirmation of the target 's destruction . Roger , sir . Give us a moment to double back . Slow down , Joe . There 's a driveway ahead . Joe : Is this it ? I don 't see an address . That 's got to be it , Joe . There 's nothing else around here . All right , well , let 's go down the road . See if we can find a way to sneak in . Approaching visual range . Pilot : Target remains . I repeat , target remains . Sir , I 've got eyes on multiple targets now . Pilot : This thing is spreading . Stein : It 's been burrowing . It 's regenerating exponentially . Not only that . Look at where it 's headed . Right here . Sir , confirming new target inbound on Carson City . Okay , engage target . I repeat , you blast that monstrosity with everything you 've got . Roger , sir . Changing vector . Pilot : ETA one minute to new target . The bombing isn 't working . It 's only making it worse . Stern : You have to stop them . Pilot : Going weapons hot . 45 seconds out . Baker and Charlie , follow my lead to picking targets . Pilot # 2 : Roger . Target confirmed . You gotta cancel this , Bob . - Are you questioning me ? - Nope . But she 's right . If we bomb this thing again , it 's just gonna get bigger . We gotta think this thing through . This thing is headed here . I don 't know how much time we 've got to think it through . Pilot : Eagle flight . Entering debris cloud . - Pilot : Visibility near zero . - Bob ... We 've got multiple bogeys on radar . Command , Eagle Baker is down ! I repeat , Eagle Baker is down ! Eagle One , clarify . It 's this debris cloud , sir . Sir , the roots are erupting all around us and they are massive . Command , Eagle Charlie is down . I repeat , Eagle Charlie is down ! Pilot : Command , I 've got too many bogeys to complete the mission . Okay , abort mission . I repeat , abort mission . Roger . I 'm getting out of here . Oh , my God . No ! Woman : Eagle One , come in . ( Static ) Woman : Eagle One , come in . ( Static continues ) Woman : Eagle One , confirm status . All right , we gotta get out of harm 's way . Is there any way to predict this thing 's movement ? Growing roots usually take the path of least resistance . We 'd be safer at a higher elevation . All right , let 's move . Okay , people . Pack it up . I 'm calling a full evacuation . Head for the transports . We 're moving out . ( Chattering ) This has to be it . They really don 't want visitors , do they ? - Yeah . That 's barbed wire . - Here . Here we go . Here , I 'll lift you up . Okay , ready ? One , two , three . ( grunting ) Noel , we have trespassers at the northwest perimeter . Frame : At C Gate . I 'll get security on it right away , sir . ( ground rumbling ) Oh , my God . ( gasps ) Wha - . Joe ? God . All right , go ! Go ! Get off the fence ! Get off ! Okay . Okay . Watch out . ( alarm blaring ) Man on P.A. : Please evacuate the facility . Follow the exit path . Get down ! Kate : Joe ! ( yells ) Kate : Joe , it 's coming . ( alarm continues ) Wilson : Jack ! - Joe , hurry ! - ( grunts ) Kate : Get up there ! ' ( Yells ) - Joe ! Kate , get out of here . Go ! Kate , go ! I 'm not leaving you . Hang on , Joe . Jack ! Follow Datsun and stay low . - Datsun ! - Dr. Stein , come on ! Kate : Joe , Joe ! Kate : You gotta get up there , now . Joe , are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah . That 's weird . It just suddenly stopped . Yeah . What do you think that means ? I don 't know . But let 's not stick around in case it starts again . Okay . ( distant rumbling ) - What happened ? - Incredible . The growth was diverted . Our garden has repelled the hostile roots . Held them back . - Noel : But they 're still spreading . - Frame : Yes . They 're in a hypermetabolic state . If I can find a way to reduce the rate of cell division , I can slow them down , control them . Like the plants in our garden . Frame : This work must not be disturbed , so you must be sure to secure the grounds . It 's only a matter of time before others discover this is the only safe haven in the country . Woman on radio : Remote base should be up and running in 20 minutes . Copy that . ETA 20 minutes . Mobile unit 's waiting for us 40 miles north up the mountain . Is that elevation gonna be high enough ? It should be . - Any idea what our casualties were ? - Tompkins : Substantial . Doctor , I need to know everything you know about these seeds . Is there anything in the Bible , the Dead Sea Scrolls , anything at all that can help us fight this disaster ? There is a warning in the Bible . From the Book of Isaiah . " The earth mourns and withers , befouled by its inhabitants . Hence a curse devours the earth , and those who live upon it . " How does that apply to us ? What does that mean exactly ? Are you starting to get your faith back , Jack ? I don 't hear our science agencies coming up with any answers . The seeds are from Eden , a time when the earth was pure . Stein : Before pollution . I think the Bible was warning us to take care of Mother Earth or face her wrath . What are you saying ? That 's why they regenerated into something bigger after we bombed them . Right . The more toxins we throw at it , the bigger it 's gonna get . To cleanse the earth . We 're not gonna beat this thing by fighting it head-on . We gotta find an angle . Well , the answers we need are in there . You see an entrance ? Joe : Bingo . Guard on walkie-talkie : Copy that , Team 2 . - Come here , come here . - What ? There 's someone out there . Guard on walkie-talkie : Team one , check in . - Team , go on to zone five . - Kate : He 's got a gun . - He 's coming this way . - Really ? Yeah . ( Branch snaps ) Go , go . Now ! - Whoa ! Go , go , go , go ! Why are they shooting at us ? I don 't know . You wanna stop and ask them ? Doctor , the chopper will be here soon . That 'll give us a better look than that satellite imagery . They just confirmed , sir . Man : Reno 's being devastated . Jack , look . The root growth has been destroying everything in its path . Except here . Why would it skip this area ? It 's the same elevation as everything else it 's destroyed , right ? Good question . - We need to go there and find out . - Right . I think we 've got something here . Understood . Doesn 't matter . We 're moving on . - Changing course . - Changing course ? Operation Safeguard 's in effect . - Sir ? - What is Operation Safeguard ? It 's the evacuation of all Cabinet personnel to a fallout shelter in the Colorado mountains . Don 't you think that 's a bit premature ? This crisis has just begun . The President 's science advisors ran computer simulations . In one week , the whole country will be consumed . And in 24 hours , Cheyenne Mountain and Colorado will be inaccessible . Okay , that gives us 24 hours to fight it . That 's exactly what I and the Administration will be doing . But from the safety of the shelter . We need to protect the executive branch of government . - You know that . - Look . The destruction has skipped this entire area for some reason . We need to get there , find out why . It might hold the answer on how to stop this thing . And what if it doesn 't ? What then ? It 's a waste of precious time . Hiding in the mountains . That 's a better use of our time . The plan is to get out of harm 's way until we can come up with a solution . That 's absurd . On whose orders ? The President 's . We 've been assigned to join the team at Cheyenne Mountain . Military transport will be here in 30 minutes . You can choose to be on it or you can risk your life on a hunch . Your choice . Dr. Stein , you 're more than welcome to join us . After all , we need to protect great minds . ( Groans ) - You okay ? - Yeah . Joe , what ... Whoa . Kate : It 's beautiful . What- - what is this place ? What do you think they 're hiding ? Something they don ' ! want us to find . Not if they 're shooting at us . Maybe we should leave , Joe . - This is getting dangerous . - ( groans ) You 're bleeding . Oh , my God . You 're shot . It 's just a graze . Don 't worry about it . No , that looks serious , Joe . You need medical attention . Yeah , well , that 's not gonna happen . Besides , I 'm not leaving until we get proof to nail these guys . Okay ? Okay . Try to stop the bleeding with this . - Okay . - You 're no good to me if you 're dead . ( Chuckles ) - ( branches snapping ) - ( voices overlapping ) Okay , we gotta lose these guys . Let 's go . ( Groans ) You want to explain to me what 's going on , Bob ? As far as I know , our responsibility is to protect this country , regardless of the risks . We were trying to protect this country . What are you talking about ? - We screwed up today , Jack . - What do you mean " we " ? SCOPE had a covert team in the field when this thing went haywire . What were they doing out there ? Securing the seeds from Kyle . You 're kidding me . Those seeds are a security threat . Once we had credible evidence of their existence , we had no choice but to pursue possession of them . Why wasn 't I told about this ? I couldn 't talk about it . It was top secret . Top secret ? Screw top secret . You hid a vital piece of intel when millions of people 's lives were at stake . ( Sighs ) Bob . That 's how the game 's played , Jack . You know that . It 's not a game . There 's real people out here losing their lives . Transport will be here in 10 minutes . You can still join us . Give the President my regards . - Where are you going ? - To clean up the mess you made . ( walkie-talkie chattering ) There 's an answer here . We just have to find out what it is . Couldn 't agree more . Where exactly are we going ? You 're not coming . This could be a one-way ticket . I want you to stay here and wait for the transport , okay ? - All right . - You take care of your family , Datsun . Thank you . Good luck , Jack . - Doctor . - Be safe . Tompkins : Keep your head down . This is where we 're going . Put your headset on . Pilot : Stand by for lift off . Tompkins : Copy that . ( Panting ) ( groans ) Joe ! Hey , look . We need to get you help . Yeah , from who ? From those trigger-happy lunatics ? Okay , maybe we can find a first-aid kit somewhere . Kate ... Kate ... What 's happening to me ? You 're healing . This doesn 't make any sense . How ? It 's the leaf . Something in the leaf healed you . - I can 't believe it . - Would you stop that ? Sorry . It hurts ? No , um , I 'm ticklish . ( Groans ) This is no ordinary garden . No , it 's certainly not . Can you smell the air ? It 's so fresh , so pure . ( voices in distance ) No time to smell the roses . Let 's go . Datsun : Sir , you need to see this . - What 's happening ? - Movement . It 's coming at us fast . ( ground rumbling ) What are you talking about ? I thought we were safe at this elevation . Not anymore , sir . Root growth just erupted around Lake Tahoe . The disaster 's really picking up steam . It 's spreading everywhere . How long before transport arrives ? I 'm unable to make contact with them . Okay , what do you mean you can 't make contact ? ( Computer beeping ) Man : Whoa , whoa . We need to evacuate right now . - Let 's go . - You guys get out of here ! Soldier : Move , move , move , people ! Datsun : I don 't see it following us yet . - Look out ! ( ground explodes ) ( brakes screech ) Reverse . Reverse ! Get us out of here ! Datsun : I can 't . It 's behind us . ( yelling ) Kate : I don 't see him . All right , come on . ( Liquids bubbling ) Whoa . ( Beeps ) What do you think 's going on here ? I don 't know . Joe : But this has got to be where those roots came from . Look at that . - Are those seeds ? - Yeah . That 's cold . They 're keeping these seeds dormant . - Why ? - I have no idea . ( Door rattles ) Go , go , go , go . ( door unlocks ) You people better pray this area we 're going to hasn 't been affected . 'Cause no way can I land this thing anywhere else . And depending on how fast those roots spread , we may not have enough fuel to get clear . Let 's pray for a miracle . Good luck with that . You don 't believe in miracles ? Six months ago , my wife and daughter were involved in a car accident . My wife died instantly . My daughter was in a coma for four weeks . I prayed by her bedside every night to any god who would listen . Then my child died . So , no . I don 't believe anybody 's looking after us . ( Beeping , bubbling ) ( beeping rapidly ) ( computer beeping ) What was that ? The world needs to see this footage , Joe . Yeah . We got enough evidence to nail them . Let 's go . Tompkins : These seeds Frame is using in his experiments , if they 're in fact from the Garden of Eden , what exactly is it we 're gonna find down there ? If Frame did recreate the garden and we find it , it 'll be miraculous . It 's been said " He who walks among the garden shall have the healing power of gods . " I just don 't know that my belief system 's ready to take that big of a leap . Well , regardless of the seeds ' origin , do you have any idea what this means if we find them ? The miraculous good they can do for the earth ? Are you nuts ? These seeds need to be destroyed immediately . - Destroyed ? - Yes . I don 't think so , Agent Tompkins . These seeds are the greatest find in history . Everything you 've ever read in a science hook is going to change . These seeds are the single greatest threat mankind has ever seen . That 's because the roots are out of control . If we can modify the seeds , they have the power to revitalize the earth , the power to regrow rain forests and areas inflicted with droughts . Nothing on earth has such powers . Tompkins : They 're too dangerous , Doctor . All I see is my country being destroyed . The irony is , we started it . What are you talking about ? SCOPE was involved in a covert op that went bad . That 's how the seeds got out . Federal agents were trying to get their hands on them . Why didn 't you tell me this before ? I didn 't know about it until Bob told me a half an hour ago . The roots stem from an original embryonic root . The taproot . If he knows exactly where the seeds began growing , we might be able to stop them by killing the taproot . Contact SCOPE . I need to talk to Director Wilson . Yes , sir . Good news , Noel . I created a serum that can lower the metabolism of the roots . Does that mean we can stop the overgrowth ? If we can find the original embryonic root , we can put it to sleep and bring it here . Analysis of the taproot can tell us what went wrong , how it mutated , and how we can prevent such a catastrophe from happening again . Come on , come on . ( Walkie-talkie static ) - Guard : Hey ! - Go ! Run , run ! ( gunshots ) ( gasping ) - Sir ? - Yeah . I 've just learned SCOPE 'S mobile unit was taken out just after we left . - Are they sure ? - Pilot : Yes . Pilot : Reports are the whole Tahoe area has been destroyed . Guard on walkie-talkie : Intruders are northwest of me . Shoot on sight . Shoot on sight . Oh , God . - ( Gunfire ) - ( yelling ) ( grunts ) Don 't- - don 't stop . Go , go , go , go , go How much further ? I think I see it up ahead . That 's incredible . That forest is like an oasis . It 's completely untouched . Any idea what would 've kept it so insulated ? Stein : If it 's Frame 's property , he 's certain to have modified the plants . But I 'll have no way of knowing until we get down there and investigate . ( Panting ) - You okay ? - I can 't run anymore . Okay , that 's okay . I think we lost them . I can 't believe I lost that damn camera . We have to go back and get that video , Joe . The- - that video is the only proof we have . No , no way . It 's too risky . Besides , they probably found it . Maybe they didn 't . Maybe it 's just lying there on the ground . ( Helicopter blades whirring ) You hear that ? Yeah . Hide . Hide . Man , these guys just don 't give up . Maybe it 's not the same guys shooting at us . They might be someone who could help . - Only one way to find out . - Okay . Tell security they are not to let that aircraft land on the grounds . Frame : My work is at too critical a stage for interruption . Yes , sir . - And tell them to mind the clocks . - Yes , sir . Security ... There 's an open area to land in near that dome . Gonna take her down there . - ( Bullets ricocheting ) - Get down ! - I 'm taking fire ! - No kidding ! Get us out of here ! - ( Glass breaking ) - ( Stein screams ) We 're going down . Hang on . Oh , my God . Joe : They hit it . This is not gonna be a soft landing . ( metal crunching ) ( screams ) Check for survivors . ( Panting ) Are you okay ? For God 's sake . Who 's shooting at us ? Somebody who doesn 't want us here . What are we gonna do ? I mean , these guys are ruthless . Why would they shoot down a helicopter ? Well , the same reason they 're shooting at us . Well , should we check if there are survivors ? No . No , I guarantee those gunslingers are on their way to that wreckage right now . There 's nothing we can do to help them . We need that video , right ? Okay , let 's go back and look for it while those guys are distracted and then we 'll get the heck out of here . Okay . Is he alive ? No . ( Tompkins cocks gun ) You ever use one of these ? Me ? No , no , no . I don 't do guns . ( Bird chirping ) ( panting ) Oh ! ( Birds chirping ) Oh , my - Jack , look at this . - Yeah , this is the spot . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Where 's the camera ? - You see it ? - No . Joe . You found it ? Bag 's empty They took the camera . Newscaster : Moments ago , we received this stunning footage from our affiliate in Sacramento showing enormous roots growing out of the Sierra Nevada Mountains of Central California , heading west . Tens of millions of people are in its path . Chaotic evacuations have jammed the roads and trains , bringing the transportation system to a standstill . - Just as alarming ... - ( knock on door ) - ( door opens ) - ... the growth is accelerating ... It was a government helicopter . They only found the pilot dead . Have them sweep the grounds . Someone else had to be aboard . One of the guards found this . ( whispering ) Here , come here . Oh , my God . Tetracentron . It 's an extinct plant genus . This is the garden , Jack . So this is Frame 's property . That 's no coincidence it 's remained unscathed . I can 't believe that bastard 's trying to kill us . Those roots- - those monster roots , they just can 't seem to get in here , right ? So there 's gotta be something here that 's stopping them . Something in the plants ? Something in the soil . How 's that ? Some plants have pesticidal abilities . They excrete an antitoxin into the soil to protect against invasive vegetation . I 'll bet you anything this garden has enriched the surrounding soil with antitoxins . Like an antibody . It has to be what 's keeping the roots out . These antitoxins are the key . You need to get to work making a- - what is it- - serum or something , right ? How ? I don 't have the equipment . I need a lab to extract the antitoxin . It 's that facility . I bet there 's a lab in it . And if there is , I know I can get us inside . Let 's go . SCOPE agent on video : The sooner you show me the product , the sooner we can get out of here . Kyle on video : Is that the money ? Show me . SCOPE agent on video : Now you show me something . Come on , come on . This way . ( Footsteps approaching ) ( grunting ) Don 't hurt him , please . Who are you ? We didn 't mean anything . We 're only trying to save lives . - Who are you ? - We 're environmentalists , okay ? - Who are you ? - Were you in that chopper they shot down ? What are you doing here ? We 're trying to prove that these guys started this disaster . - Who ? - They 're like some kind of fringe scientists or something . We 've been to their lab . They have , like , test tubes with roots and seeds in them . Get up . You need to take us to the lab now . No- - no way . It 's too dangerous . - Now . - They 're trying to kill us . Do you have any idea what 's going on out there ? This country is being destroyed . If we don 't stop it , there 'll be nothing left . What ? Well , then we need to get to our families . You can 't . There 's nowhere to go . We 're surrounded by destruction . This area 's the only part of the region that 's been spared . Oh , my God . Wh- - why do you need to go to the lab ? To make an antitoxin to kill the roots . You wanna see your family again or not ? Your call . Joe 's voice on video : Was that a gunshot ? Kate 's voice : Oh , my God . They shot him . What 's happening ? Joe 's voice on video : An earthquake . What is that ? Kate 's voice : Oh , my God . What ? Okay . The taproot . So we were watching an illegal hazardous waste dump . A man in a van showed up with some other men . They shot him . He dropped something , and then those giant roots grew like crazy . No wonder the roots grew so fast . The seeds were released in a hazardous waste site . The roots had the same reaction to the bombs . They mutated as a defensive measure , right ? To cleanse the earth of all toxins . Jack , they can show us where the taproot is . ( Noel cocks gun ) Freeze ! Put your hands in the air ! This is Noel . I 've captured trespassers in the northern woods . Need security here now . Guard on walkie-talkie : Roger that . Noel is it ? I 'm a federal agent . We need to use your lab , okay ? - Put your gun down . - Can 't do that . Noel , it 's me , Dr. Stein . We 've talked on the phone . Frame hired me to find the seeds . I said don 't move . Stay right there . Easy ! All right , I 'm gonna drop to a knee , okay , guys ? When I do , I want you to run right back the way we came . - Okay ? - Yep , - Everybody good ? - Mm-hmm . In position . Go . - Get down ! - ( gunshots ) ( gunfire ) ( groaning ) Come on . We 'll take you to the lab . This way . Come on . Oh , my God . Guard : We 've got him pinned down ! Wallace , circle around ! I was right . There 's some kind of chemical compound in the soil . The antitoxin you were talking about ? I have to extract it . Can you get me some water ? ( gas hissing ) - Do you have a lighter ? - Yeah . Here . So you think this stuff can stop the roots ? - ( door handle juggles ) - ( knock on door ) Frame : Who 's in there ? Frame : There is critical work in there that can 't be disturbed ! I warned you there was a danger to releasing a prehistoric plant in this toxic world ! What , you know this guy ? Frame : Jocelyn , is that you ? There 's no need for this , Jocelyn . Open the door . Frame : Kyle betrayed me . He released a seed before it was ready . It caused the metabolism of the roots to go wild . That 's why I 've contained my work to soils that were pure . That magnificent garden out there that the seeds have spawned . That 's my vision . Not the horrible destruction that was unleashed on the world . I don 't want that any more than you do . I 've found a way to stop it . Frame : Then we must work together . In a matter of hours , the roots will reach the coastline . This will cause an explosion of new growth as they consume the polluted ocean waters . The whole world will be threatened . You already tried to kill me once . What guarantee do I have that you 're telling the truth ? I was defending my life 's work . I had no idea it was you . I would never harm you , Jocelyn . You know that . Please . Open the door . We need to work together to solve this crisis before it 's too late . You 're not really gonna open that door , are you ? We can turn this around . The mutated roots are purifying the earth . They 're destroying man 's pollutants . So imagine what they can do if we- - if we can control them . ( door unlocks ) Good to see you , Jocelyn . I 've extracted an anti-toxin from your garden soil . If we inject it in the taproot , it will kill it . That 's going to be difficult without knowing the exact location of the taproot . They know the location of ground zero . - Noel . - ( 93595 ) You shouldn 't play with guns . They can go off . That 's it . Get up . Let 's go . Frame : Noel . Jack , we don 't have as much time as we thought . Within hours , the roots will hit the Pacific and this crisis will go global . Agent Tompkins , I 'm Jeremy Frame . Yeah , I know who you are . My apologies for the aggressive nature of our defense . Surely you understand how high the stakes have become , given my property 's the only sanctuary . Jack , I extracted the antitoxin from the soil . Is it strong enough to kill the roots ? Yes. inoculate it directly into the taproot , it should circulate through the system - and kill all the roots . - You concur with that ? Dr. Stein has never disappointed . Well , there is one problem . Once the taproot realizes its limbs are dying , it could regenerate new ones the way it did after it was bombed . It would start the whole disaster all over again . So we 'll just blow it up after we poison the roots . Tompkins : But how do we even get to the damn thing ? I don 't believe that the aircraft you arrived in sustained any mechanical damages . No , but you killed my pilot . - Who 's gonna fly it ? - Frame : I will . I have a Class One pilot certificate . Okay , you kids sure you remember where ground zero is ? - Yeah . Kemble Mines , near Lovelock . - Mm-hmm . Good . Let 's move . Are you sure you want to go through with their plan , sir ? Isn 't the taproot the key to learning what went wrong ? You guys are crazy , you know that ? Are you really gonna trust this lunatic ? - You wanna fly this thing ? - Yeah , this guy gives me the creeps . We don 't have a choice . Hop in . - ( Alarm blaring ) - ( yelling ) ( ground shaking ) Frame : We 've reached the coordinates of the mine . Either one of you recognize anything ? It all looks so different . Hey , hey . Over there . I can see the entrance to the mine . See those cluster roots ? That 's where the taproot is . Well , if that 's ground zero , it means the roots are cutting right through the mine shaft . - Right here . - Where can you land ? I see a level area just above the mine entrance . We can land there . All right . You two kids stay in the chopper . What , are you kidding me ? We didn 't come all this way just to sit here . You did your part . Now let us do ours . Tompkins : Watch your step . No telling what 's down here . Besides hazardous waste ? Could be anything . Bats ... rusted metals ... rattlesnakes . I 've trekked through tropical jungles , waded through infectious waters , and I meet my demise on a rusty nail . ( Static ) ( woman 's voice , faint ) ... from Sacramento have been cut off as aerial footage shows massive destruction and possibly thousands dead as the anomaly spreads west . Whoa . Good God . Tompkins : So that 's the taproot . I 've never seen a taproot anything close to this kind of structure . ( dirt , debris pattering ) Magnificent . Shame we have to destroy it . I could spend the rest of my life studying this thing . That thing is a killing machine . I can 't tell you how much sleep I 'm not gonna lose once I blow it to kingdom come . First we need to poison the root system before the roots reach the coast . ( Cocks gun ) ( Tompkins reloads gun ) ( hissing ) ( liquid bubbling ) How long before the poison kills all the roots ? With a taproot this size , it could take a while . ( ground creaking ) - ( groaning ) - What 's happening ? Stein : Incredible . It 's already starting to regenerate . It knows the roots are being poisoned . Why is the ground shaking ? Kate : Something 's wrong . I don 't know . Joe : But it can 't be good . - ( Beeping ) - I 'm gonna set this detonator for one minute , before this thing has a chance to regenerate . - Tompkins : Get ready to run . - Not so fast . I think we should go see if they need help . Let 's go . Whoa . Come on , Frame . What are you gonna do , shoot me ? - Yes . - ( screams ) ( panting ) ( groans ) What are you doing ? We have to stop this . The root , yes . There 's no need to destroy the taproot . Yes , there is . It will regenerate a new root system if we don 't . ( Groans ) Open the case . I won 't ask again . ( Groans ) - What is this ? - Take it out . It 's a serum . It will put the taproot into a dormant state so it can be studied . Frame : You said yourself it would be a shame to destroy it . Inoculate the root . You 're insane . This thing is way too dangerous to preserve . If I can train the taproot to grow normally in polluted environments , it will cleanse the world . We can start anew in a purified Earth . The Earth that God intended it to be . God never would 've intended this . - ( groans ) - No ! Ah ( groaning ) Jack ! Jack ! Jack . Oh , my God . Hang on , Kate ! Come on . We don 't have much time . Kate : They 're all around us . What do we do ? Joe : Just hang on to something . ( Metal creaking ) You okay ? We need to get you to a doctor . Good luck with that . ( Footsteps echoing ) Oh , my God . You guys okay ? He 's been shot . We have to get him out of here . No , no , no , no . We can help him . You 're doctors ? ( Chuckles ) Yeah , I wish . Leaves from the garden ? Yes . ( coughing ) This I gotta see . Hey , don 't knock it , man . These saved my ass today . ( coughing continues ) ( Tompkins groans ) Oh . " W " How ? They secrete a resin with extraordinary healing powers . No kidding . You 're right . We 're all gonna have to buy new science books . Yeah . ( Bubbling ) ( beeping ) I think I got it . ( squeaking ) Look how tame this one is . How 'd you do that ? Frame 's research and some good old-fashioned genetic modification . " Good old-fashioned genetic modification . " Good thing about these seeds having accelerated metabolic rates is that you can alter their genomes in a matter of hours . Well , yeah , you know ... 'Course . This is how Frame created his garden . This plant is a miracle . Yes , it is . Go on . I still don 't trust it . Have faith , Jack . ( sighs ) ( inhales deeply ) Will you- - will you look at that ? What- - what do you know ? Wow . ( Music playing )

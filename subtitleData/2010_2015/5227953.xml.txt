 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall ... her son , a genetically engineered boy genius ... a schoolgirl investigator across the road ... and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . The shop 's owner , Mr Smalley , who refused to give his age , said he saw a creature 12 feet tall , with huge fangs and red eyes . What are we up against - the Gruffalo ( ? ) LAUGHTER Well , there 's only one way to find out . BELL RINGS Hello . CACKLING Hello ! Hello ! What is it we 're looking for ? Haven 't the foggiest . But I 'll know it when I see it . That 's what my mum says when she 's dragging me round Primark . Ooh , I always wanted one of these when I was little . MUSIC PLAYS Is that a blood stain ? But whose blood ? That is the question . Oh , I 'm sorry , Mr Smalley ? Or ... co ? Some say that arrow was pulled from the eye of King Harold himself after the Battle of Hastings . And some say he wasn 't shot in the eye at all . Read that online . The tapestry of time is a fragile thing . Apply the slightest pressure , and the threads of history can unravel . But you understand that , don 't you , Sarah Jane ? How do you know my name ? Oh , I know a great many things . The newspaper cutting ... that was for our benefit , wasn 't it ? Look , I don 't like being tricked . Who are you and what do you want ? I need your help , to save the world . Time itself is under threat . From what ? Chronosteen . Three pieces of it , moulded into different objects , are lodged at key points in the Earth 's history . PARROT CAWS They must be recovered . What objects ? Where in history ? They could be anything , anywhere . Well , good luck with that . But you are the only ones who can do this ! You 're the Earth 's last hope . Even if I believe you , how can we possibly find this Chronosteen ? This is a Time Window , Sarah Jane . It will take you close to the objects . If you can create that , why can 't you go yourself ? It is forbidden for me to travel through time , but you can . All of you have passed through it before . Look , if we go , and I 'm not saying that we will , then how do we get back ? Find the objects , and they will bring you home , and I 'm afraid , Sarah Jane , there is no choice in the matter ! And be careful ! History can be a dangerous place . PARROT CAWS That 's right , Captain , they have until the sands run out ... or this world is doomed . Sarah Jane ? Rani ? Where are you ? ! More to the point , where am I ? Hello ? Clyde ? Rani ? Can anyone hear me ? FOOTSTEPS THEN HEAVY BREATHING Oh ! Heavens , oh , you gave me a fair fright ! Creeping up like that ! You are not expected till the morrow . Where am I ? Where is this ? I beg your pardon , my lady , are you quite well ? I am sure it has been a long journey from the East , but ... Did you say you were expecting me ? Of course . ' Twas the Queen 's personal request that you came . Seriously ? Is this Buckingham Palace ? ' Tis the Tower of London , the royal chambers . And Queen Jane is eager to meet you . Jane ... My , you are tired from the journey . I am Mistress Ellen , head of Her Majesty 's household . I 've been with her since she was a babe . Lady Jane , she was then . Lady Jane Grey ? I 've certainly heard of her . She was made Queen , nine days ago . Of course , the Nine Days ' Queen . Now , we had best find more suitable attire ... for the Queen 's new lady-in-waiting . No network . I don 't think we 're in Ealing any more , Clydey . Psst ! Psst ! Quick , or they 'll see you ! Get down ! Well , wherever I am , they haven 't invented style yet . I 'm Clyde . Who are you ? My name 's George , George Woods ... and you can hardly talk . Now , keep your voice down . Why , what you looking at ? Germans . I 'm sure of it . What , nabbing all the sun loungers ? Mum warned me when I was evacuated that the country folk was a bit thick . Evacuated ? Right , I get it , so this is like ... 1939 or something ? But she didn 't say just how thick . It 's the 7th of June , 1941 . Really ? That 's seriously cool . So when you said Germans , you actually meant ... Nazis ! At last , I have you trapped ! Now , speak your name , spirit ! I 'm not a spirit - I 'm Sarah Jane Smith . Why are you haunting this house ? Look , if I was a ghost ... And by the way , there 's no such thing . .. you wouldn 't be able to touch me , would you ? Come on . See ? Just as solid as you are . Pleased to meet you ... ? E-Emily Morris . Do you live here ? Nobody lives here . I 'm just investigating . But there are ghosts in this house , everybody says so . Well , just because everybody says something doesn 't make it true . That door was locked , so if you 're not a ghost , how did you get in here ? Er , yes , well that 's a little tricky to explain . What year is this ? 1889 . SPECTRAL VOICES No such thing as ghosts , you say . What was that , then ? Come on , let ME have a go . They could be Brits - it 's hard to tell . Are you sure they 're Nazis , George ? Yeah , I see it ! You 're right ! Time travel 's awesome , isn 't it ? I 've got to do it more often . They must have come in on a U-Boat . An invasion ! We shall fight them on the beaches , we shall fight them on the ... the other places . But , hang on , what ARE going to do ? We 're going to call the Home Guard , of course ! Good thinking , ' 40s boy . Ready . Ta-da ! Ooh ... What do you think ? Most becoming , my lady . 'Tis only me , Your Majesty , and your new lady . May we enter ? Lady Matilda , my crown , please . Thank you . We are ready to receive you now . Your Majesty , may I present , Lady ... Oh . Lady Rani . From the court of ... the Taj Mahal . I know it not . But you have clearly travelled far , Lady Rani . I am most grateful . You may leave us , Ellen . You too , Lady Matilda . Forgive me , but I thought the request was for an elderly companion . And I heard the Countess of Arundel was already on her way . Your Majesty , can we trust this ... foreigner ? I hope the Queen will judge me on my own character , just as she might judge you on yours . Well said . Matilda , where are your manners ? I say again , leave us . And what is this you bring ? It 's a music box . Go on , open it ! MUSIC PLAYS How is this possible ? They 're dead clever where I come from . Thank you , Lady Rani . I will treasure this forever . It must be hard for you , being so far from home . Especially if you knew how far away home really is . I too am alone . Even those I thought most loyal now call for Lady Mary to be crowned in my place . Oh , it is all too distressing to discuss . No , tell me . It 's important . When the King died without an heir , we thought his sister , Mary , would take the throne . But they made me Queen , and I never wanted to be . My father-in-law saw it as a way to gain power for himself . Father-in-law ? You 're married ? My mother forced me to marry Lord Dudley . But the man is an ass ! He talks of nothing but himself , fails to compliment me if I wear a new gown ... Oh , and he never washes . Yeah , I know guys like that . I like you , Lady Rani . You speak to me as a person , not a queen . Tell me of yourself . There 's not much to tell , really . Are you married ? Shut up ! Sorry . I mean , no , Your Majesty . Well , you know , I 'm only 17 . I am but 16 and wed . Do you not have a sweetheart ? There must be one gentleman who occupies your thoughts . There is someone I spend a lot of time with . Wouldn 't exactly call him a gentleman , though ! Where are we going ? St Michael 's . They 've got a telephone . Clyde is doing well ... CAWING .. but you 're right , Captain , he must be quicker . We cannot keep the Time Window open much longer . Now ... what of Sarah Jane ? Odd . So much chronon energy ... I 've checked upstairs - there 's nobody there , so it 's got to be ghosts . Not according to this , it isn 't . What is that ? And where are you from exactly ? A long way away . And this measures energy fields , amongst other things . The readings are very unusual . Who owns this house ? The Tillotsons , but they couldn 't bear all the ghastly noises , so they moved and locked the place up . I 'm rather handy with locks . Oh , well , yeah . You and me both . Funny thing is , it was 60 degrees Fahrenheit outside , but it 's 41 in here . Classic sign of ghosts . What is it with you and ghosts ? Just curious . No , there 's more to it than that . Nine weeks ago ... my mother , she ... she ... she passed over . I 'm sorry to hear that . She disappeared from my life . Father says she 's gone , but she can 't have gone ... not forever . CLOCK CHIMES Eight o 'clock ! That 's it - that 's when they say it starts . When what starts ? The haunting ! It 's supposed to happen each night at eight . SOUND OF DOOR OPENING What was that ? Shh . Listen . WOMAN : So sorry I 'm late , Mrs Bruce . I know . Well , have a great evening . See you about half eleven . RUNNING FOOTSTEPS The stories are true . There IS something strange in this house . Yes ... and it went that way . MUSIC PLAYS The melody is so very pretty . I shall never tire of hearing it . Lady Rani , what are you doing ? Are you looking for something ? Sorry , Your Majesty . I 'm meant to be . It 's complicated . You can tell me . We 're friends now , are we not ? Of course we are . What is it , Mistress Ellen ? It is ill tidings . They say Mary and her army have reached London . This was nailed to the door of St Paul 's . I fear to read it . " On this the 19th day of July , 1553 , " Lady Mary makes just claim to the Crown of England ... " .. and she calls upon all of her subjects to reject ... " any unlawful claimants . " Then I have no need of this ... .. for I am no longer Queen . And if I am not Queen , then I made false claim to the throne . That makes me a traitor . The punishment for traitors is death . Right , phone , Georgie-boy ? This way . Operator ? Hello ? Operator ? It 's dead . The phone 's completely dead . That 's strange . So what now ? Is there any other way of getting help ? I remember Mr Porter saying something about ringing the church bell . But that was only in a real emergency . And what 's this when it 's at home ? ! That 's them ! Quick ! THEY TALK IN GERMAN Good morning . I am Lieutenant Koenig . And you ... are my prisoners . I 'm getting the same readings here . RUNNING AND GIGGLING What was that if it wasn 't a ghost ? Old houses , they sometimes retain an echo of the past , trapped within the very fabric of the building . WOMAN : Yeah , but I can 't come out , Joe , not tonight , it 's impossible . It 's the same voice as in the hallway . Shh ! You know I 've got to look after Ben and Katy . Yes , I know , but ... Yeah , all right , just chill out . " Chill out " ? ! She said " chill out " ? ! What does it mean ? Ghosts are supposedly an echo of the past . But this person ... is from the future . This doesn 't happen . You lot shouldn 't even be in this country . Quite a statement ... from a negro . Reduced to name-calling , are you ? You 're just a gang of bullies , picking on others for what they look like , and that is why you 'll lose this war . Underestimating the enemy through blind , stupid prejudice ! Kirsch , open the case . This is what will guarantee certain victory for Germany . Our technology is so far in advance of your pathetic efforts . Oddest looking radio I 've ever seen . That 's because it is so much more than a radio . A transmitter then , maybe ? What is that ? It was discovered beneath the Rhineland . The Fuhrer himself believes it to be Thor 's Hammer . Our scientists have found it to be a great source of power . Did you see that ? See what ? Must be what that junk shop bloke 's after - something that can change history . You 've got to give that to me ! Get back ! I 've got work to do here , and you are getting in my way . Bagar , tie them up and lock them in the vestry . Los ! Los ! They 're going to execute her . But she is only 16 and she hasn 't done anything wrong . We could all face the axe , my lady . There must be something we can do . Not tonight there isn 't . We shall see what the morning brings . Good night , Lady Rani . Trent ! Trent , are you there ? I hear you bring word from Sir Thomas . ( I have a letter . ) If this is what I think it is , then I will not have to hide my true purpose for much longer . Something 's causing this time and the future to cross over , which means there must be a trigger , somewhere in the house . You see , I was sent here to find an object . What object ? All I was told was it 's made of metal and it 's interfering with the course of history , which ... which is a very dangerous thing . So have you come to help ? Well ... Are you ... from the future ? Yes , I am . 2010 ! That 's over 100 years from now . That 's impossible ! GIGGLING It 's coming from in there . GIGGLING GETS LOUDER That machine 's dangerous , I know it is . And the hammer , that 's what I 'm here for , it 's got to be . Then we need to escape then , don 't we ? If you hadn 't noticed , we 're both tied up and locked in . Just reach into my pocket - I 've got a penknife . Way to go , Georgie-boy ! There 's nothing here . Nothing we can see . GIRL : Ben , don 't ! You mustn 't ! You know what Mum told us . BOY : Shut up , Katy ! It 's only a candle ! Mum does it all the time . But you mustn 't ! Please don 't ! Sarah Jane , look ! It was 41 degrees downstairs , but it 's 75 in here ! That 's because this room , in the future , is on fire ! CRACKLING Tell Sir Thomas the deed will be done by daybreak . ( God speed , my lady . ) It is time to bid Lady Jane Grey farewell ... .. for she dies tonight ! Good ... news ! Ta-da ! And more good news - I know a way out that they don 't . There are benefits to being an altar boy . CLUNK ! Was ist das ? ! I think they might have heard that ! Clyde , quick ! Ben , it 's locked . Let me try . Ben , we 're trapped . I can 't stand it ! CRACKLING It 's just like ... like that night ! Can 't we save them ? Somehow , we have to find a way . They 're taking too long , Captain ! We need the Chronosteen now ! CAWING And the sands have almost run through ! If Sarah Jane and her friends do not return soon , they 'll be trapped in the past ... .. forever ! Lady Matilda ? The echoes of the future must be getting stronger . George ? ! Oh , am I glad to see you , Miss ? ! But they 're all armed , remember ? Yes , George ... and so are we . It 's going to begin again , isn 't it ? It has to . We can 't help those children unless we understand . I 'll burst in - you two bring up the rear . You have condemned her to die . Get after them ! The Time Window should have closed ! The whole planet will be sucked in . So he must have sent me to the wrong time . The Sands of Time have run out , Captain .

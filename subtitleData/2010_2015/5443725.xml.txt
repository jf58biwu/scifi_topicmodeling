It is possible , isn 't it ? Anything 's possible . Claudia , don 't look away ! That 's it , that 's right . Try not to panic . Breathe . [ Both gasping ] No ! No , I will not let this happen .

[ Exhaling ] [ Metronome ticking ] [ Inhales ] [ Sighs ] Hey . [ Crying ] Oh , my God . What happened ? [ Laughs ] [ Metronome ticking ] There has to be something more that you can tell me . Something specific . Knowing the evil won 't help you locate the astrolabe . I have to know everything . Everything about the astrolabe in order to find it . For instance , was it used before ? Yes , but every circumstance is different . And the evil that was released ? By Robespierre , at the advent of the French Revolution . The reign of terror . Which resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people , so you see the possibilities . Nothing ? There was nothing that could be done to stop it ? [ Sighs ] Yes , I 've explained the only way to stop the evil from being created is to reverse the effect of the astrolabe . There has to be another way . It was huge . With wings and these glowing eyes . Yeah , he started acting weird right after lunch . Must have been the mushrooms he had in his salad . That happens sometimes , especially with wild mushrooms . It 's the psilocybin . Thank God you got here in time . It was like he was having a nightmare , but he was wide awake . This happened as soon as you got home ? Right after I got inside . Did you see anything else ? Anything unusual ? Nothing . Okay , look , Robin , just walk me through this , okay ? Jimmy was home , you got home from the store . You got out of your car . I grabbed the groceries from the trunk . And then I go inside . Oh , yeah . There was a man . He thought he dropped my key , but- - Wait , wait , wait . A man . A man- - a man thought what ? Well , he handed me a silver key , but it wasn 't mine , so I gave it back . A key , a key . Mykes , do you still have those sketches ? Yeah , if you could just excuse us for a second ? Yeah . You know , there must be some sort of time element to this artifact . I mean , her husband saw some terrifying something , and then we show up a few minutes later , and we don 't see anything at all . And the same thing happened to the cops at the diner . A key . Nightmare . Tentacles . Tentacles ! Would you stop staying that word ? That 's it ! That 's it ! - Cthulhu . - What ? That 's what I 've been trying to remember , Mykes . When I was a kid , I read these comic books about a sea creature named ... Cthulhu . " Created by H.P. Lovecraft . " You know , I 've never read anything by him . What ? A writer you never read ? Well , when it comes to horror , I 'm more of a Kafka or Shelley girl . But Cthulhu , I mean the mythos does permeate a lot of popular culture . Well , you lost me there . But these things that they 've been seeing ... Are definitely Lovecraft . Tentacles , claws , and sometimes wings are all common to Lovecraft creatures . Apparently , he suffered a form of waking dream called night terrors . They came to him in his dreams . - Nightmares . - Right . And yes . He blamed it on a silver key . He called it " the key to the gate of dreams . " Aha . I smell artifact . Okay . Thanks , Leena . Okay . Okay . So--so a man in a baseball cap gives Robin a silver key . - Right . - Right ? She walks into the house , like the guy at the dental office . Or the kid in the diner- - oh , my God , Pete . We 're looking at this thing all wrong . It 's not the people who are seeing Lovecraft 's creatures who 've been affected . It 's the victims . The victims are the ones who get whammied . The artifact makes people see them as monsters . Okay , we need to go to talk to the first victim . - We can 't . He 's in a coma . - Okay . Well , we 'll just- - we 'll go to his house then . And--and try and find a connection . Let 's go . I 'm not finding anything . Mykes . Look at this . What ? It 's from the championship game . Didn 't Robin say that our key collector wore a hat from the championship game ? Yeah , so ? So they went to the same game . Philadelphia versus Cincinnati . Okay , so what was so important about that game ? I don 't know . After Cleveland lost , I quit watching . Which was early . Wait . Philly versus Cincinnati . I remember something about that game . You know about a sports event ? Something that could connect our victims ? [ Tapping keys ] Not something . Someone . [ Clicking ] Theresa Hicks . She died at that game . I feel like I 've been hit by a truck . Yeah , well- - [ Groans ] The last thing I remember , Marcus was coming at me with a syringe . Ooh . Guess I wasn 't much of a hero . Oh , no , you were a hero . You were amazing . Oh , yeah ? So how did I end up here ? Well , the injection Marcus gave you was pretty intense . You know , you were out of commission for a while . But what you did saved us . Your intel led us right to Sykes . - So he 's- - - Finished . - The Warehouse is safe . - And Marcus ? Also finished . For good , this time . [ Sighs ] Well , I must have been out of it for a while - to have missed all that . - Yeah . But you 're back now , Jinksy . Good as new . Why aren 't we in my room ? No reason . It 's cleaner , easier . It 's closer to the front door , really . - Claudia . - Yeah ? What aren 't you telling me ? [ Laughs ] What ? Nothing . Oh , now you 're lying . [ Laughs ] Okay . I guess we didn 't lose the whole human lie detector thing . God , I was kind of hoping . Lose ? Why would I lose- - [ metronome ticking ] [ Ticking grows louder ] Steve , listen to me . I wasn 't lying to you , exactly . A lot of things happened . [ Door shuts ] Here 's the security camera footage we have from that part of the stadium . The victim 's name was Theresa Hicks . I know . It 's a name I 'll never forget . [ Tapping keys , computer beeps ] Look , that 's her right there . She was knocked out . Wait , stop . Stop . That 's him . That 's--that 's the guy who was attacked at the dental office . - He knocked her down , right ? - Right . That 's- - that 's the accountant . Could you keep it running , please ? [ Tapping keys ] He got in his way . Oh , my God , that 's--that 's Joe , - the kid from the diner . - Yes , it is . - He wouldn 't help either . - Oh , wait . Let me pull up a different angle here . [ Tapping keys , computer beeps ] Okay , this is a few seconds later . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Wasn 't she just holding his hand a few seconds ago ? That newspaper article- - it said that Theresa Hicks was engaged . Right , right . Uh ... Ron Hadsell . He 's trying to save her . - Why won 't she help ? - That 's Robin . - The--the housewife . - He couldn 't save her . - What ? - He couldn 't save her . He--he couldn 't save her , so he blames them . All those people . The man who pushed her down , the woman who wouldn 't stop to help . To Ron Hadsell , those people are monsters . He used Lovecraft 's key so that people would see them as real monsters . And suffer the same fate as his fiancee did . [ Tapping keys , computer beeps ] [ Sighs ] Pete , look .

God , I 'm sorry any of it happened . But if you think I 'm going to apologize for bringing you back , I 'm not . You know , maybe it was completely selfish of me . Maybe I ruined your karma or put a kink in your plan to achieve enlightenment and come back as a butterfly or whatever Buddhists do . Maybe I 've upset the whole cosmos . I don 't care .

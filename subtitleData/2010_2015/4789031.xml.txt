 Odi ! That 's bad , Odi ! Do you want lasagna ? REAL HUMANS Guys ... I have a few things to say . Tobbe ? I think we should keep her . Anita . Good . Applause for mommy . I want us to treat her like a member of this family . Like a human , at least . I don 't want orders barked at her . She shouldn 't have to do everything . And she 's not cleaning your rooms , or making your beds . That 's your job . No back scratching . And after 9 pm , she 's off duty . - Off duty ? - Yup . - What does she get out of that ? - That I don 't know , but ... I think it 's a matter of dignity , I , I don 't know ... - I agree , so I 'm in . - Sure . Yes . - I like Anita . - I do too . That was that . We leave for grand dad 's in an hour . With Anita . - But ... - She can sit in the trunk if we drive carefully . I 'm sorry . I forgot ... to lock the door . On saturdays , we 're open for the public between 10 to 5 pm . And we have service on sundays . In other matters , the parish office is open , 3 miles from here . The fuse box . - The power is out . - Right ... Just tell me where it is . In to the left , behind the curtain . But the fuses are at the parishes ' office , I 'm afraid ... - But I can call the caretaker . - No calls . We need power and somewhere to stay . Oh ... - Please ? - But where 's your owner ? - We have no owner . We 're liberated . - From .. ? Drain our fluids skin us separate our body parts . We agree that regular hubots must be traceable to an owner . But we 're different . - We can tell you 're a good person . - Because of this ? No ... I can see it in your eyes . We can only plea to your compassion and understanding . Honey . He 's not home ? Oh ... So you 're here now ? - Yes . - Come on in . - You 'd like some coffee ? - Please . It 's very hot in here . - She never airs the room ? - She 's charging . - No coffee for the young ones ? - No . - And not ... - Anita . - We haven 't met . - You 're the freebie ? - I don 't know . - From the shop , where you 're from . Have you seen that she changed her headband ? She 's picking large ones with bright colors . - Can I help Lennart with the coffee ? - It 's fine , Anita . I mean that you don 't have to . Mathilda ... - Did you say Vera was charging ? - Yes . She 's charging . During daytime ? - But she 's not charging . - What ? She 's shut off . I 'll turn her on later . Now , let 's drink some coffee . She 's not supposed to be turned off . Ever . What 's the time ? 11.05 . It 's 11.05 am . Correct me if I 'm wrong . - That 's right . - Don 't ... It 's 11.05 pm . Today is december 5 , 1989 . - Wrong . - I just turned her off for a while . - What has happened ? - She 's lost all the settings . Take Sofia out and play or something , I have to fix this . I just pressed the button . But why turn her off at all ? What if something were to happen ? There is no reason at all to turn her off . - Now I know that . - You must have done something else . - I just pressed the damn button ! - Hans , take it easy . I 'm sorry ... Go swim without me . I must reinstall everything . Will take at least an hour . Maybe it 's the heat ? This way . - You 're aware of the risk we 're taking ? - What choice do we have ? Come on in . - Hello . - Hello . What are they doing here ? Who are they ? What do they want ? - If they 're involved in the murders ... - Eva , calm down . You saw it yourself . They 're harmless . Hubots can 't harm humans . - You can never be certain ... - Hey , you . Excuse me . We need an extension cord . We 'll go there tonight . I think I know what to do . Here . Good . Go outside and stand guard . - You like those colorful headbands ? - Yes . We can buy new ones at the store . At the store where I came from ? - I don 't think they sell headbands . - No . Tobbe , can you play with Sofia ? You remember the shop you came from ? No , I don 't . Would you like to go there ? - Yes . - Okay . - Then we 'll go there . I promise . - Thank you . And we 'll shop for headbands . And I brought this for you . I don 't know ... Mom ... Don 't turn into one of those who dress up their hubot . Embarrassing . Mom . Help ! - Leo ! - Help ! Leo ! - Excuse me ? - Leo ! Move it . You hear me , pacman ? What the hell 's the matter with you ? You stalled ? You stupid , fucking machine ! Move , or you 'll end up in the dumpster . Do you understand me ! ? Do you belong here ! ? Do you ! ? I 'm calling EHURB , you fucking Frankenstein . You stand right there . You hit me . They 'll trash you , fucking Windows brain . Hey , could you connect me to EHURB ? They 'll recycle your ass . Nice to be related to a vacuum cleaner ? - Great . This is ... Come on . Here we go ... " Troubleshooting . " Where do you live ? - I live in this house . - Good . - Who else lives in this house ? - Lennart . - Good . - And the other one . The other one ? The one in the basement . This is wrong ... - Only you and Lennart lives here . - And the one in the basement . - But there 's no one in the basement . - I 'll fix this . - No one 's there . I know . - There was a man in the basement . - Nonsense . Okay , Vera . Could you show me this man ? Where would he be ? Wait here . He lives in there . Lennart locks the door . This man , in here . What does he look like ? 6 feet tall , brown hair , pink shirt , blue pants and yellow shoes . It 's a hubot . They collected Odi . You didn 't get a receipt on the demolition ? Of course . But I threw it away . I don 't want to be reminded of him . - Why would I need that receipt ? - It 's okay . Sorry . Vera was so convincing when she described this man , and exactly like Odi . Yes , well ... I have showed her pictures of me and Odi . I can 't be responsible for her delusions . You trust her more than me ? - I know what I have and haven 't done . - Why do you lock the door then ? Because I want some part of this house undisturbed by her constant cleaning . - Cleaning , cleaning , cleaning ... - We believe you , dad . - And I want you to tell her that . - Well , If you 've got nothing to hide . - This is about integrity , Hans . - Okay , sorry ... I have my model boats down there . - You build them yourself ? - Yes . Couldn 't you show me ? I 'm sincerely curious . Look at that . Toot-toot . - Lots of stuff you could get rid of . - No , I don 't think so ... If you like it down here , you could clear some stuff , to get more room ... - I think it 's time to go upstairs . - Like this old ... That can come in handy . There 's no one downstairs . And the room downstairs , is his private room , where no one has access . - Understood . - And I want lasagna . - Lasagna , once a week . - But ... - Deal with it . - Yes . Good . - Goodbye . - Goodbye . You can start with the lasagna right away . - Hello . - You talked to a hubot ? - Yes . - And the one that hit you ? - Don 't know . - You couldn 't conclude what it was ? - I didn 't see him . - How do you know it was a man ? - Him , her or it . I don 't know . - Can you describe the one you talked to ? Sure . They 're everywhere around here . A regular workhub . One of those , exactly . But he was different , somehow . More aware , or something . - More alive ? - Different . He hit me with that . Thank you . - Thanks . - Well , thank you . A Humax G-75 . You know how many there are ? - It 's common ? - Very . Most every houseowner has one of those house gnomes in the garage . This one too . I checked your second hand value , on the internet , if you 're interested . Not too bad . But it seems I can get more , if you 're sold in parts . I only want what 's best for you . Then I want it to be more like I would like to have it . And a little less like you want it . Shall I help you to bed ? I can do it myself . Sleep well . SLEEPING PILLS Sleep well , Lennart . Can I talk to the manager ? - It says you keep inside the law ? - Do you want work done on it ? Erase owner-ID ? Lift the restrictions ? - Yes . - We don 't do that around here . Come on ... An offer . Boarding for Max and me . Power for him , food for me , in return , I 'll work for free . For one week . Most people want a hub that can protect them . Or one that 's a bit more fun in bed . But that 's like tuning a moped ... I work in the source code . I change their DNA , if I have to . I 'm certain there 's those looking for a more intense experience . A more living individual . This will be fine . Support the collection for a hubot-free elder care . Hubot-free elder care ? To ban hubots completely is something that will lead to fewer sympathizers . The long term goal is to be rid of them , but for now I think we benefit from admitting they can be useful for , let 's say , hazardous waste and cleaning . - I 'd like to add to that . Or comment . - Certainly . Bullshit , is all I can say . The dolls have to go . Every one of them . Well said . This cute stuff won 't get us anywhere . And that must stay in the manifesto . I 've been a member of this party since the start . - Well spoken ! - Good , good . May I then ask you all if we want to be a party for a few hundred or for millions ? Soon there will only be a few hundred of us left . Don 't you get it ? Wake up ! Soon we 'll be working for them . I agree with the chairman . We have to find a broader way to gain opinion . Or we 'll be made out to be hostile to human progress . I 'll gladly be that , rather than hostile to humankind , like the hubot-huggers . - Good ! Finally ! - Bravo ! Sit down ! - Can we not discuss now ? - Can we return to the agenda ? They 're taking over the party . We 'll have dolls running around in the party office . Shit ... And some fucking hubot-hugging chairman . Shit ... - Hey . - Hey . - Roger . - Beatrice . Malte . Just wanted to say , I 'm all for you guys . - Have me met before ? - No , this is my first time . - You know anyone here ? - No , no , no . What do you mean by " all for you " ? Well , what you said . Your opinions . To get rid of the fucking things , " Real Humans " isn 't the way to go ? Exactly . It seems a bit ... - A bit soft ... - Yeah , a sewing circle . That 's exactly what it is . A fucking sewing circle . Hey ... We have some ideas we could run by you , if you 're interested . If I 'm interested ? Absolutely , sure . You smoke ? Let 's have a ... Come on . No phone number . Just the address . - Good , see you later then . Bye . - Bye . MISSED CALL - " KEVIN " New message . Hello , Roger . I 've heard your messages to Kevin . He 's got a new phone plan , so you know and save you the trouble . We have a new life now and suggest you try the same . Net-dating perhaps ? There 's someone for everyone . Believe me . What 's happening tomorrow ? Car needs a wash . I thought Anita could do it . I thought I could take Anita tomorrow . Go out shopping . - You and Anita ? - Yes . But you can 't have her as a shopping buddy . We 're shopping for her . Headbands . She can 't care about what headband she 's got on ? Yes , she does . This is no good . She 's a housekeeper , not company . And we 'll visit the store where we got her . Oh ? She wants to know where she 's from . She 's a computer , honey . There 's an word for people who have relationships with their hubots . I read it in the paper . They 're called " hubbies " . Have you become a " hubby " ? What are you afraid of ? - You wouldn 't react , if it was a dog . - I don 't know about that ... Hans , I won 't leave you for Anita . I will be monitoring this closely . Hello , Tobbe . Do you want something ? No . I 'm sorry . Leo . When you find Mimi . Will you leave me then ? - Why would I ? - Will you ? I won 't leave you . I have told you that . Okay ? Do you remember anything from here ? No . PRICE : $ 175.000 How much did I cost ? I ... I don 't know . It doesn 't matter . You were expensive . - Need any help ? - Just browsing . Absolutely . You saw the price tag and , " whoops " . This hubot may not be for everyone , but for some . A pure social hubot with a life story designed by R.D. Koepling . Manufactured in only 1000 units . And every unit is unique . Unlike your model there , this one has the closest thing to a soul , yet . Samantha . - Forgive me , I don 't recall your name . - Really ? I feel so tired today . The memories of the past , haunt me . I can 't reconcile with an event from when I was 19 . During a bohemian experience in Paris . - Thank you , Samantha . - Farewell . As you can tell , she requires a little maturity . Not unlike a good wine . - Our domestic models are over there . - Like I said , we 're just browsing . Of course . Anita . Anita ? Don 't mind what he said . I think we 'll leave now . Like she 's been 19 . Ridiculous . I don 't know what this gave us ... I 'll sell it on the street . You can always have sex with it . Had it been a good brand . But this is where you came from . - No , thanks . Thank you . This is where we 'll live . - Ourselves ? - Look at the kitchen . That stove costs $ 8000 . Why do we need a kitchen ? We 'll have human friends . We have to dine with them . Oh ... This is where you snuggle up afterwards , by the fireplace . - That 's just a dream . - This is a photo , Gordon . It exists . And no one lives here , see ? It 's empty . We 'll each have a bedroom . I will meet a man . A human . Why don 't you meet a woman ? I don 't know . I will fall in love , and live here . We 'll have 5 children . You can 't have children . We will adopt . There 's lots of humans that can 't have children . I will never have any children . And no wife . Why do you say that ? I feel lonely when you look in that magazine . But you 're not alone . You 're with me . Don 't forget that you 're just like me . We 'll get through this , as long as we stick together . Do you understand what it is we 're supposed to get through ? Step right in . - Hard to find ? - No . Well , this is my place . - The bathroom ? - Over there . It 's Malte . - Hey . - Hey . Welcome . - Here 's some pacman-free coffee . - Thanks . Expensive , but no fucking hubot has touched the beans . Right . There ... - Right , you don 't smoke . - Sometimes . I can take one . Thank you . - You live here alone ? - Yes . We have separated . We had a special piece of furniture for smoking . A wagon with a marble lighter . Those were the days . Back when you got letters . I 'm a mailman , you see . I 'm one of the last humans at my office . - Same here . - Went on my route no matter what . - How about that coffee ? - Sorry . - Please , honey . It stinks . - I 'm sorry . I 'm writing the sermon and I need to smoke to get through it . Thank you . Okay ... DOUBLE HOMICIDE MAY BE HUBOT DEED We want to know if you 're involved . If you are , we must ask you to leave . Do you know anything about this ? - Isn 't it where we charged ? - No , Gordon . Different house . With friendly people who let us use their power . People we thanked . That 's right . If you want us to leave , we will do so . But we have nothing to do with this . We don 't have the ability to hurt humans . I have to speak with my wife first . Who are you , really ? - So , what do you guys do ? - I 'm a supervisor at a warehouse . Mostly electronics and chemicals . - I guess I should have told you . - Really ? I 'm a police officer . I thought you 'd say you were in the pacman business . - No chance . - Police . That 's an honest living . Right now I 'm with EHURB . A unit for hubot-related crime . I don 't know how much you guys know of what 's going on out there . - More and more hubots . - But it 's worse than that . Just a piece in a grand design to turn humans into slaves to the hubots . A nonworking human must be destroyed . The solution , because we no longer can feed the population of real humans . Hubots don 't eat . As you know . No ... They sure don 't ... I have to ask . - What is it we 're supposed to do ? - Who said we 're doing anything ? I just said that we should do something . CEMENT Hello , Lennart . - Have you been okay ? - Yes . Excellent . What shall we do ? What shall we do ? What can we do ? Down here . Build model ships . - Paint them . - I guess ... - Play cards . - No . I don 't want to . Or just , chill . Chill ? It means , doing nothing at all . I don 't want to ... chill . Lennart ! Dinner 's ready ! Tell me what you want to do . If we 're to do this , everything else must be secondary . Our lives , relatives , work . Everything . We must be able to trust each other . Yeah . Are you in , even if we have to break the laws of this fucking pacman-society ? And swear not to give in , until the last fucking hubot leave this world ? The world we inherited from our forefathers , - real humans . Will you ? - I swear . - I swear . I swear . Good . The female who lives here , referred to the other woman as wife . So ? It must have been a lie . They are both female , or am I mistaking ? Can we really trust these women ? They 're fascinating . Meet them , instead of fantasize about how awful they are . The murders 12 miles from here is no fantasy . - Everyone knows they can 't hurt humans . - They 're computers , Åsa . Machines . - We 're just as much machines as them . - Stop it . You 're a priest . What does the bible say ? Maybe you can just pick and choose ? What does the bible say about the love , you and I share ? I 'm forced to follow my heart . Or I would deny everything I believe in . What was the tip ? Someone saw the priest talk to some characters by the church . - Hubots ? - I don 't know . - Hello . Police . We have a few questions . - What 's going on ? You 've heard about the homicides , 12 miles from here ? Of course . - Can we come inside ? - Sure . We 're just following up on observations that 's been reported . - A member of the choir can 't be involved . - No , no ... - Any hubots in the household ? - No , it 's just me and my wife . - Nice old house . - Yes . Bea . You love old houses . Maybe you 're allowed to look around ? - I 'd love to . If it 's okay ? - Yes , of course . - Is it 19'th century ? - 1788 . Noticed anything around here , since it happened ? No . - You work in the church too ? - I 'm a librarian . - Sorry ? - Librarian . Oh . Nice . Bea is crazy about old houses . Maybe you should warn her about the rotted floor on the attic . - Should I ? - Yes , so she 's careful . Bea ! Watch out for the floorboards in the attic ! They may have rotted ! Okay ! - You live here together ? - Yes , we 're married . Oh . Then you ... - ... live here together . - Yes . - In other words ... - Yes . - Thank you for letting me see the house . - Any time . Thank you . - Did you see anything ? - It was nothing there . They matched the prints on the crowbar to the ones they found in the house . What are we doing here , then ? What have we done ? - Why didn 't you say they were up there ? - Calm down . - It 's murder . - Nothing points to them . - I 'm not staying another second . - Eva , Eva , Eva . - Let me go ! - Calm down . - I can 't be here with them . - Eva . Calm down . I love you , Eva . But you need to find your strength . There ... Wait here . Vera ! ? Yes ! ? Could you please check upstairs , for my green windbreaker ? There ... Let 's go . You can take those . Let 's go . Oops ! Oops ... Lennart ! Just drive ! Drive like hell , Odi ! Towards Skåne . Help ! Mommy ! Mommy ! Mommy . Help ! Leo ! Help ! Leo ! Leo ! Leo !

 TAYLOR : That 's it . Portal Terminus . You came through it the day you got here . I don 't remember . Then again , it was pretty much a blur . One minute I was in 2149 , the next ... I was here . Hope Plaza sent it through in pieces after the Fourth Pilgrimage . Some assembly required . Before we got it , there was no way of knowing where the Fracture would spit people out . Second Pilgrimage ended up about eight klicks north of here . Third Pilgrimage , they landed smack in the middle of Arrowpoint Lake . That was fun . So this thing fixes the portal on our end , huh ? You 're not going to ask me how it works , are you ? Nah ... Good . I 'm really not in the mood to pretend I know . The Eleventh Pilgrimage is due here in a matter of days . I want that Sixer spy locked in the brig before the new colonists get here . How 's that coming ? Interviews still in progress . There 's still a few left . Actually , uh ... I need a word with Riley . Fair enough . I 'm gonna head in . Gotta dispatch the afternoon patrols . Mm-hmm . Everybody clear on their orders ? Sir , yes , sir ! Eyes on the portal round the clock . Any activity , I want to know ASAP . Riley , step out . Sheriff wants a word with you . What are you standing around for ? Sheriff . What can I do for you ? As you know , some evidence that may have identified the spy was destroyed in the infirmary the other night , and I need to question everyone who had access . You understand ? Of course . Ask away . Okay . You checked into the infirmary that night . Why ? Fresh squashed my thumb in the door of a rover . I said I was sorry . But , thanks to your wife , it 's fully operational . Good . Well , did you see anyone ... or anything ... unusual in the infirmary that night ? Uh , just staff , patients , family members ... just like any other night . All right . That 's all I need . Skye . Appreciate you coming in . No problem . Getting me out of construction duty . Those are some nasty cuts on your hands . Rough work ? Brutal . I volunteer before every Pilgrimage , and I always end up looking like I took a midnight swim in a lake full of xiphs . Thursday , between 9 : 00 and 11 : 00 a.m. , where were you ? The spy tried contacting the Sixers that morning , so I need to know where everyone was . Oh . I was with , uh ... Josh . Oh , yeah ? What were you guys up to ? What you say can and will be used against you . We were at my house . On the porch . Um , I ... I was trying to teach him how to play chess . Oh , yeah ? How did he do ? Diamond in the rough ? But I think he has potential . Ain 't that the truth . ( laughs ) All right , well ... if you see anything suspicious ... I 'll let you know . Great . Okay . Don 't think this gets you out of construction duty . ( ball bouncing ) Josh ... I 'm sorry . Is this bothering you ? How about now ? You know what ? I 'm just going to ignore your desperate cry for attention . Okay . What just happened ? Josh , did you do something ? Why do you always have to blame everything on me ? Because everything is usually your fault . It 's my plex . You blew your core . Mine died last week . Hey . Mom , my world just ended . She just needs a new core . A promethium core ? Well , you might have to wait till the Eleventh gets here . But I have everything on my plex . My-My diaries , my homework , my music , my books ... - my whole life ! - Sucks for you . ELISABETH : Maddy , promethium 's a highly specialized piece of technology . It 's not like we can just walk down the street and get you a new one , you know ? And there 's a colony-wide shortage as it is . I don 't know , maybe you can scrounge one up from somewhere , but for now , I think you 're just going to have to make do , okay ? Who wants lunch ? Uh , can 't . Gotta go to work . ( sighs ) Try Casey Durwin . He might be able to help you out . Just bring something to trade , okay ? SKYE : Oh . Josh , hey ! Hey . Where you headed ? Ditch duty ? New apprenticeship . Auto Bay . Um ... I wanted to ask you something . Shoot . Heads up . Um ... Uh , so I just got done talking to your dad and , um ... if he asks you where you were last Thursday , could you just say that you were playing chess at my place ? Why would I say that ? Because I am asking you to ? What were you really doing ? Stuff . Like ? It 's stupid . Skye , it 's me . I was pinching some copper tubing from maintenance . And by " pinching " I mean " borrow . " And by " borrow , " I mean I will give it back eventually . Happy ? Are you making a new still ? Is this one of Hunter 's brilliant ideas ? Something like that . Right . But ... So ... will you cover for me ? You 're asking me to lie to my dad . Your dad 's looking for a Sixer spy . Unless you think it 's me and - I 've just been fooling everybody ... - I know you 're not a spy , Skye . Okay , so what 's the big deal ? Sure . No problem . Thank you . I knew I could trust you . ¶ ¶ Intel . You 're welcome . ( coughs ) Oh . Hey , Mom . Bucket . My sweet Bucket . I 've been worried . It 's been a week . I know . Sorry . I worry . You know I worry . I can 't help myself . I know . Have they been feeding you okay ? ( sighs ) I 'll try to come by more often . I brought you some food . - Where 'd you get that blanket ? - Hello . Who are you ? Bucket , it 's all right . This is ... Lucas Taylor . The honor 's mine . You 're Taylor 's son ? Yeah . I 've been told I have his eyes . You 're supposed to be missing . You found me . What do you want ? I want us to be friends . Your mother and I are friends . Right , Deb ? Lucas brought the blanket . It 's the least I could do . Your mother needs her rest . Can we talk outside ? How sweet . Mommy doesn 't know you 're a spy , does she ? My guess is , she has no idea what you 've had to do to keep her alive . Don 't talk about my mother . Why don 't we talk about my father , then ? How is the Great Commander these days ? Has he walked on water yet ? Raised a man from the ... What do you want ? I have a job for you . I work for Mira . And who do you think she works for ? The Sixers can 't complete their mission without me . If I need you to do something , believe me , Mira will understand . Do you know what this is ? My life 's work . How to make the time portal go both ways . I 've almost solved it . Congratulations . Thank you . But the equation needs to be factored and reconciled . I could do it by hand , but it 'd take weeks , maybe months . In Terra Nova , in the Eye , it would take less than an hour . You want me to do it . I 'll give you a day . No . Information only . That is my deal with Mira . Just plug it in . Let the Eye do the rest . What if I don 't ? It 's a long way down . You 'll do it , or ... I 'll toss your mother over the side , and then she 'll find out just how far down it really is . You better get moving ... Bucket . Terra Nova S01E11 " Within " I double-checked the perimeter , just like you asked . There 's a drainage ditch outside the Ag-center . It 's small , but it wouldn 't be impossible for someone to sneak in and out that way . Put a security cam on it , just in case . Will do . And Wash , double up on your west perimeter patrol . I want eyes on that tree line . Will do . Hey , Dad . Josh . Oh , Josh , before I forget ... last Thursday , between 7 : 00 and 11 : 00 a.m. , where were you ? Uh , playing chess with Skye . Where ? Her place . All I needed to know . ( clanking , hissing ) Hello ? ( door hissing ) ( device trills ) Activate . ( undulating tones , electronic whirring pulsing ) Well ? You 're a smart girl . Okay , say I did have a use for a frilly green scarf , an old teddy bear ... Miss Dorothy . Yeah , and what the heck ... ? Abacus ... I used to collect them , but this is the only one I brought through the portal with me . Well , it still wouldn 't be enough to buy a promethium core . Look , I bet that this is the only abacus on Terra Nova . With good reason . Which makes it rare . Which makes it junk . One man 's trash is another man 's treasure . Look , I appreciate the hustle , okay ? But the reality is if you got nothing to trade , I can 't help you . You see the trick is to ... ( electric whirring ) Damn it . Bum wheel . What was I saying ? The trick is to find something ... Yeah , to find something that the person can 't live without . Then you make the trade . - No one needs an " acubus . " - Abacus . Whatever . ( whirring , grinding ) Hey great pick . What if I could get you a wheel ? Well , then , my friend , we could talk . Those are not ... Lucas ? Bucket , did it work ? Yeah , I think so . For your sake and your sweet mother 's sake , I hope so . LUCAS : Yes , yes . I knew you could do it . This is gonna work . I 'm so close . Just a day or two . I 've seen these before , out by Snakehead Falls . And did you tell my father ? No . Area 's off-limits . He needs to keep our issues in the family . The two of us , we suffer from a Shakespearean relationship that borders on Greek tragedy . Have you always hated him this much ? No , not always . It started in 2138 , August . What happened then ? Ask him yourself . So after the portal opens both ways , what then ? You 'll see , now ... Now , out , Bucket . I 've work to do . Don 't make me tell you twice . Shannon , check this out . What do you got ? This is footage from a few hours ago from the camera at the Ag-center . That 's Skye . What 's she doing ? I 'm sure she 's got a perfectly good reason to be sneaking out of Terra Nova through a drainage ditch covered in brushthorn . - I 'll notify the commander . - Hold on . I gotta ... I gotta double-check something . ( playing a gentle tune ) Josh ? Listen , I 'm gonna ask you something , and I need you to be honest with me , understand ? Sure . You weren 't with Skye last Thursday , were you ? No . You know where she was ? Yeah , she said that if you ask , I should say I was with her . I didn 't think it was that big of a deal . I thought you were looking for a Sixer spy . What 's going on ? ( sighs ) Josh ... you 're my son , and I love you very much ... but don 't lie to me again , okay ? Yeah . And you 're grounded . Oh , come on ! I 've been grounded since I walked through the portal . What 's going on ? I found the Sixer mole . And our son 's been lying for her to help cover her tracks . ( sighs ) I just ... And you 're sure it 's her ? I 've been retracing her whereabouts for the last week . Too many holes . She hasn 't been on construction duty like she said , plus her alibi for the morning the Sixers tried to make contact doesn 't check out . I 'm sorry . Me , too . I got a man inside the Sixer camp . I 'm gonna get to him and see if he can confirm that it 's her . Who 's your man ? Curran . After I banished him , I thought I 'd make use of him ; give him the chance to earn his way back to the colony . Well , in the meantime , I 'll get Wash to bring Skye in . No . I 've got a better idea . Your mind 's not on the game . Didn 't see that one coming , did you ? No , I sure didn 't . REYNOLDS : Commander . What 's the word on the supply convoy ? Almost ready to leave . Pack me out a rover with a .50-cal gunner . I know Devil 's Canyon better than most . I want those sonic mines at Outpost Three ASAP . I 'll run point on this myself . REYNOLDS : Yes , sir . Convoy 'll be ready to leave in an hour . Your move . Hey . Hi . You working ? Off in a few hours . Why ? I need a wheel . A wheel ? - Yeah , for Casey Durwin . - Why ? If I find him a wheel for his chair , then he 'll give me a promethium core for my plex . I haven 't done any homework or read in almost 24 hours , and I 'm going slightly insane . Okay , wait . You haven 't done homework in 24 hours ? Are you , are you okay ? You need to sit down ? Mark , it 's not funny . Okay , um ... Uh , come back in an hour . I 'll help you find that wheel , okay ? You 're amazing . Back at ya . And there she goes . She took the bait . Yep . Once Mira finds out about the convoy , she 'll be on it with everything she 's got . We 'll be ready for her . We 'll bring her in if we can . But one way or the other , this is gonna end . Still nothing , Shannon . You copy ? Yeah , roger that . All eyes still on you , and you 're clear . But when they make their move , we 'll be all over them . ( rustling ) Commander , it looks like we 've got movement . They 're coming in behind us . Talk to me , Shannon . How many ? I can 't get a visual . Stand by . ( branches snapping ) Commander , visual contact . These Sixers are 50-foot tall , gray ... ( deep grunting ) and very , very hungry . TAYLOR : We gave Mira a golden opportunity . It 's been hours . They ain 't showing . I think she must have spotted you and your team . I don 't think so . You got another theory , I sure 'd like to hear it . Maybe Skye didn 't tell her . Well , then why 'd she hightail it out of Terra Nova the minute she heard about this convoy ? Think about it . The Sixers never found any of our weapons caches . They 've never attacked a convoy when we really needed it . She 's giving them intel , but nothing that would actually hurt the colony . Why give them anything at all ? 'Cause I think they 're holding something over her . Mira . Back so soon ? Just trying to take care of my mom , since your people aren 't feeding her . You know what this is ? Medicine . Your mother 's dose for the day . What if a strong wind came and blew it away ? My spotters say a convoy went through Devil 's Canyon about an hour ago . Why the hell didn 't you contact us ? Because I didn 't know about the convoy . It 's your job to know . Your intel has been garbage lately . - I 'm doing the best I can . - Yeah ? Do better . Next week ? I 'll be here . I 'll have something . So , how about that trade ? Wow . Aren 't you the industrious one ? Well , you know , I had a little help . Did a little scavenging in the military junkyard and ¶ ta-da Breaks my heart to tell you this , but somebody beat you to it . What ? They picked up my last promethium core this morning . They traded me a brand-new wheel . Who bought it ? Tom Boylan ? Who wants to know ? I 'm Maddy . I came for a core . Because Casey Durwin said that he sold the last one to you , and I 'm not leaving until I trade . A core , eh ? Expensive piece of technology . Yes , well , I need it for my plex and my studies and ... I really like to study . Oh , yeah ? I used to like to study . Look how far it got me . How much do you want for it ? More than you 've got . Well , why do you need it ? To run a new set of taps ... highly necessary . Now , out ! Because , as you can see , I am a busy man . Well , I can help you with this , you know . I 'm-I 'm really good with numbers and organizing things . Really ? Yeah , yeah . I-I even like doing it . My organizational services for a core . Interesting proposal . Maddy ... ? Shannon . As in Sheriff Shannon ? Yeah , my dad . So the sheriff 's daughter organizing my books . Uh ... ( chuckles ) no . No . No , thank you . Did your dad put you up to this ? No ! I tell you , I tell you what . I tell you what . How about ... I just give you the core ? What , you 're just giving it to me ? No , I want you to have it . Just tell your dad what a nice guy I was giving it to you . Off you go . Okay . - It 's a little weird . - Yeah . Thank you . Would you like a wheel ? I solved it . It 's done . Thank you , Bucket . You know how to make the portal open both ways ? And now everything changes . What are you talking about ? Hey , why " Bucket " ? I have to know . ( sighs ) I ... When I was little , I wanted to be in the army like my dad , so I used to put a bucket on my head and ... pretend it was a helmet . Name kind of stuck . It suits you . I 've always found it so strange why so many people want to be like their fathers . Not me . I just wanted to destroy mine . Where are you going ? To the portal . 2149 awaits . There 's so much to do , and not much time . But I-I wanted to tell you , before I left , you shouldn 't go back to Terra Nova . It 's not safe for you there . They 're coming . Who ? My employers . The people who hired the Sixers . They 're gonna take control of Terra Nova , and if my father fights them , which he will , they 'll burn it to the ground , with or without the people in it . Why would they do that ? Control the past and you control the future . Well , Taylor won 't let that happen . He 's a man , not a god . But don 't tell him that . You 'll hurt his feelings . When the tanks roll in and my employer starts stripping this place into nonexistence , the commander will know , finally , that I beat him . I 've been waiting for this day since I was 14 years old . And I have you to thank . Searched her place , found these . They 're maintenance access cards . They 're old ones . Hacked ones . She 's been using them a couple times a week to access Relay Station Nine . Relay Station Nine ... that 's a klick and a half outside the gates . What , a meeting place ? Possibly . Listen , I know it 's not much , but there could be something out there , some , some reason behind why she 's doing all this . I sure hope you 're right . I really hope there 's a reason . So I can make some sense out of all of this . Let 's move . I shouldn 't have helped Lucas , but I didn 't know what else to do . And if something happens , it 's my fault . And something will happen ; he said it would . It 's just a matter of time . He 's on his way there now . Sweetheart , I didn 't know . Why didn 't you tell me ? 'Cause I didn 't want you to worry . I don 't think I can do this anymore . ( sniffles ) Bucket , look at me . Skye Alexandria Tate , you look at me right now . You don 't have to do this anymore . What ? You 're not doing this anymore . This has gone on long enough . If I had have known , I would 've put an end to it a long time ago . You 're going to run back to Terra Nova , you 're going to go straight to Taylor , and you tell him everything you know . And you are never coming back here , you understand ? What about you ? ( sighs ) I 've been sick a long time . A very long time . I 'm tired . Mom , please . You 've been such a strong girl . You know how proud your father would 've been ? Now , get up ... go . Don 't you worry about your mom ; I 'll be fine . Go , Skye . Hurry . ( sniffles , sighs ) I got something . Yeah , this belongs to Skye . I gave her a sonic for her last birthday . Damn good shot . Hands up ! Please don 't shoot ! - I came here to warn you . - Put the sonic down . We know you 're the spy . Give me one good reason why I shouldn 't lock you away for the rest of your life . I wanted to tell you . I just ... the Sixers have my mom ! Your mother 's been dead - for the last three years . - No , she 's alive ! They-They have a treatment for Syncillic fever , and after my dad died , I snuck her out to their camp , and Mira said that she would save her , if I spied for them . You have to listen to me . Lucas finished his calculations . What do you know about Lucas and his calculations ? I talked to him , and he 's on his way to the portal right now . He 's gonna activate it to make it go both ways . Why are you just standing there ? ! You have to go ! You 've been lying to me for God knows how long . Why the hell should I believe anything you say ? I am done lying , Taylor . - I 'm done . - Yeah ? What can you say to me that is gonna convince me that you ever actually even talked to my son ? ! He , um ... uh , he mentioned 2132 . No , no , no , no , no . Uh , 2138 . August 2138 . You go straight to the colony and wait for us there , understand ? Of course . Taylor , I 'm sorry . Dunham , this is Shannon . Dunham , come in . Over . Dunham , do you copy ? Anybody I am here with the Commander . Do you copy ... ( static crackling ) : Dunham , this is Shan ... We 're to meet you at ... now . Shannon this is Dunham . I didn 't copy . Interference on this end . Go again . Over .. ( whirring ) What was that ? The portal . It 's initiating . I thought the 11th Pilgrimage wasn 't scheduled till next week . ( whirring ) Riley to Taylor . Come in . We have unscheduled portal activity . Over . That thing 's causing interference . I wouldn 't do that if I were you . Get down on the ground ! Now ! - Don 't move . - You first . Lucas ! Step away from the portal . I 'd take it easy with those guns , if I were you . I 'll say it one more time ... step away from the portal or I 'll shoot . No , you won 't . One blast from those sonics could blow the whole Fracture apart , and that would cut you off from the future for good . And you wouldn 't want that , would you ? I can 't tell you how glad I am that you 're here . All those nights I spent out in the jungle , freezing , starving . The only thing that kept me alive was the thought of you being here - to see this . - Son ... Don 't ... Don 't call me that ! Listen to me . There are good people here . Innocent people . Think what will happen to Terra Nova if you go through with this . Oh , I know what 's going to happen . They 're going to come and take you off your throne and make you watch while they strip this place and take it for everything it 's worth . Over my dead body . Um ... that 's the spirit . Go down fighting for ... for a dream . Some Utopia , and all that 's right and true ! Open your eyes , old man ! It 's over ! I beat you . I won . Soon you 'll be on your knees , begging me for mercy . The next time we meet , I won 't be alone . Lucas ! She 's all I have . And I just ... left her there . If she told you to go , then you had to do it . You did the right thing . Skye , we need you in the infirmary right now . Skye ... Mom ! Bucket . Mom ... How did you do this ? You have this man to thank . You remember Curran ? The commander sent word to get your mother out of there and ... Curran came through . This is what the Sixers were giving her . SKYE : They , they never told me what was in it . This is good , Skye . With Malcolm 's help , we should be able to figure out what it is and make a synthetic copy . She 's going to be okay . You hear that ? We should let your mother sleep now . All right , you get some rest , get cleaned up . My office , first thing in the morning . Sir . Deborah . I 'm mighty glad to see you . Skye ... Not now . Give him time . Any word on the team ? Word from Wash is that the Sixers ' camp is deserted . ( chuckles ) They move damn quick , I 'll give Mira that . As soon as she realized that Curran had gotten Deborah out of there , she knew he 'd tip us off to their location . Look , uh , I 'm a little surprised you 're allowing a murderer back in the colony . Curran killed a man , but today he saved a woman 's life . I 'm not going to pin a medal on his chest , but he 's earned himself a second chance . You know ... most men don 't get the opportunity to atone for their mistakes . Believe me , I know something about that . I made a big one , and from that day to this , my son has never let me forget it . Somalia ? August 2138 . Lucas 's mother died ... because I couldn 't save her . He 's hated me from that moment on . You know what ? Some nights ... most nights ... I don 't blame him one bit . What happens now ? Now ... we fight . Look , we 've got to assume that Lucas made it through to 2149 . The people who are behind him and the Sixers ... they 're going to come at us hard and they 're going to come at us soon . No matter what they 're planning , the only way to get here is through Hope Plaza . That 's right ... the 11th Pilgrimage is a few days away . Let 's make sure we 're ready . There 's a chance that Lucas got caught when he arrived in Hope Plaza , right ? Lucas Taylor is smart , Maddy . I don 't think he 'd leave something like that up to chance . He went back with a plan . JOSH : What about all the people coming through on the 11th Pilgrimage ? What 's going to happen to Kara ? All we can do is hope for the best . And prepare for the worst . TAYLOR : None of you signed up for this fight , I know that . All you wanted was a second chance for yourselves and for your children . It pains me to have to ask more of you . Our home , our hope , is under attack , but I 've seen your tenacity , your bravery . I 've seen you carve out lives for yourselves in this harsh environment . I 've seen you face untold dangers , and I 'll tell you from my heart , there are no people that I would rather fight alongside . If we stand strong , shoulder to shoulder , we 'll prevail .

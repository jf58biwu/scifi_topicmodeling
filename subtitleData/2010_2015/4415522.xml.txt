 Sir ? Sir , can you hear me ? He 's alive ! Get your ass back here . Take some cover . We don 't have time to take a nap . The prisoner escaped before we recovered . I think he took a rifle . He went over there ... Rifle . Any signs ? - Negative . Startup sequence complete . Clea 19 , series Gamma , online . Hello , commander Karza . Now , Clea , activate system link . - System is linked . - You guys got her online ? - Check . - Check . - Clea , patch me into base . Transmitting . Alpha base , this is Commander Karza , do you copy ? Copy , Commander . This is Alpha base . Prometheus is down . I repeat , Prometheus is down , irreparable . We have three survivors in need of immediate extraction . We 're not picking up your ship 's beacon . Ship 's beacon was not functional . We are diverting ships to your last known coordinates . ETA in 110 hours . Upon their arrival you need to activate your personal beacons . - Copy that . - What is the status of your cargo ? Cargo has survived and fled crash site . Commander , mission parameters remain : Organism must be contained and delivered . And Karzo , it 's imperative that you bring him in alive . Is that understood ? Commander , do you copy ? Yeah , roger that . Karzo out . End transmission . - Thanks for the help . What else is new ? - Enough . This mission has been a joke from the start . You think that is a joke that we lost our ship and our crew ? Your prisoner brought my men down single-handed . And you couldn 't do a damn thing to stop it . I don 't see anything funny about that . Do you , soldier ? No , sir . - Good . Now , Clea , speak to the Lieutenant . Hello , Centauri 7 . Oh , you are hurt . Yeah , give me a diagnostic . Substantial trauma to your left shoulder . No broken bones . Heart beat is elevated . Otherwise you should be in excellent condition . Clea , skip trace improvement . Activating tracking system . Redirecting cells to repair nerve and tissue damage . Increasing endorphins to counter pain . Better . The subject is 250 meters southeast from your position and moving away at a steady rate . Are you sure it 's moving away ? Yes , Commander . - Let 's get on the move and set out . We need supplies . How much left ? - We 'll take Logan 's pack . Clea , any idea where we are ? Planet is uncharted . Computer shows you on unknown set of coordinates . Gravity of the nearest planet to the rest . Give us the stats . Atmosphere is thin , likely to render you unconscious . My advice : keeping your helmets on until I 've finished acclimating your bodies . Surface temperature is 116 degrees . - Nice . ... cells are at 72 percent , which can last just about 100 hours . Anything else ? Calculating the position of the sun , I estimate 34 hours of daylight with 5 hours of night . Sound like paradise . Maybe I 'll move here . I can arrange that . I 'm sure you could , sir . According to Clea , we 've got less than three days to get this thing . Let 's move out . Croyer , give me your torch . What are you gonna do ? Weld it back together ? It 's on the move again . Let 's go . On your feet . This is brutal . I don 't understand how this thing can move so fast in this heat . - Simple . It wants to live - pure survival instinct . What 's the rush ? It 's got no food , no water . We can track every move he makes . Let it die of thirst . That 'll be an easy recovery . You heard them . They want it alive . - Why ? - It 's not your place to question orders , Lieutenant . It is , when it 's costing me the lives of my men . This is a simple transport mission . Are you done crying , soldier ? Lay it up and move out . Both of you . Closing in on subject . ... klicks , and increasing . There ! Where is it ? Up on the ridge . 8 o 'clock . Looks like it can get up on the north side . Grab Karzo 's rifle . I 'll cover you . Go ! I see it . - Shoot it . They want alive . I 'm in command now . Take it down . - Target locked . - Take the shot . It 's down . Hold position . It 's secure . I got it . I said hold position . I 'm coming up . It 's nothing here but its cloak . Fall back ! Fall back ! Croyer ? Croyer ? - Thought you were dead . - You are not that lucky . Where is my rifle ? Ask your prisoner . Night 's falling . Let 's get a place to set up camp . Hard to take the ground . Only two access points . I can still catch him . If you need to rest , you stay here and I 'll ... If you think I want to hear your opinion , soldier , I don 't . Kid was too green . He never should have been in the unit . - Blew our chance . - He wasn 't the one that rushed us into an ambush . The situation doesn 't determine the outcome , Lieutenant . Confidence and skill do . Unfortunately , your team was ... those trick . Now , make yourself useful and set up parameter around those rocks over there . You have your orders . 34 degrees and dropping . Private channel opened . What 's the Commander 's condition ? He 's suffering from a plasma wound to his side . Extreme nerve damage has been sustained and his left lung is impaired . What meds you got him on ? 500 cc 's of strofin and 250 cc 's of crioxen . I 'm surprised he stayed on his feet as long as he did . Reduce his medication . We 've got a long way to travel tomorrow and I 'm not gonna carry him . I 'm not sure if Commander Karzo will agree with your assessment . Keep the information on fly . He doesn 't need to know . It is not in my programming to lie , Lieutenant . You won 't be lying , you just won 't be volunteering information . - Can you do that ? - Of , course . Thanks . - Odd . - What 's that ? Of all the soldiers that I have been assigned to , you are the only one that has ever thanked me . - Do you mind it ? - No . I quite prefer it . Isn 't it tiresome to be endlessly ordered about . We have something in common then . Your words conflict with the military directive , Centauri . So I 've been told . According to your record , some of yours previous insubordinations - ... border dangerously close to treason . - And ? It poses the question of why you were chosen to be a soldier ? Yes , it does , doesn 't it ? Atmospheric conditioning will be complete in T - 10 seconds . I advise you to keep your eyes on out objective instead of me , Lieutenant . Atmospheric adaptation is complete . It is now safe to remove your helmets . Why is the prisoner not affected by thin air ? He doesn 't wear the life suit . They can adapt to almost any condition . All this was in the file . Permission to speak freely , sir ? Permission ? This never stopped you before . Go ahead . What is so special about it , really ? Why is this thing so important ? - Does it matter ? - Yes , it does . - Why ? - I lost my ship and my crew . - I 'd like to know why . - You are a soldier . We both are . We follow orders without question . Tell me what you know otherwise I go alone . Disobeying orders is treason , soldier . Punishable by death . All right . This thing is the last of its kind . We destroyed its whole world and somehow it 's figured out a way of how to return the favor . So , we don 't catch the damn thing and get it back to base , we may not have a world to go home to . Now you know as much as I do . Does it make you feel better , soldier ? Or you want to sit down and discuss it some more while this thing is gaining ground on us . You deliberately kept us in the dark . - You didn 't need to know . - Oh , I see . This mission was a hero maker . Everything we know was at risk . Are you deaf as well as stupid ? What level was this mission ? This discussion is over . What level was this mission , sir ? - 41 . Nova class . - Highest level . And you were so caught up in your own ego , you didn 't bother to tell us how dangerous this creature was . Your men were incompetent . Don 't blame me for your mistakes . You jeopardized this mission . You got my me killed . I 'm your superior officer and you speak to me as such . Why ? You don 't deserve it . Come over . Let 's see how much fight you got in you . You 're not worth it . Clea ? What 's the prisoner 's position ? I had no visual . Clea ? Clea ? Come on . Come on , baby . Don 't leave me out here alone . Starting sequence complete . Clea 19 , Series Gala , online . Hello , Centauri 7 . Clea . - I thought I lost you there . - You can 't get rid of me that easily , Centauri . I 've suffered some damage but seem to be functioning properly . I 'm ... and quite durable , you know . That 's why I keep you around , babe . I thought it was my charming personality . Clea , what 's the prisoner 's current location ? 78 klicks and increasing . Look like it 's just you and me now . I am sorry about Commander Karza but if I may say I 'm pleased it was you who survived . Well , it makes two of us . Skip trace prisoner . 200 microkliks on your current location . Continuing in south eastern direction . On the move again . I hope you rot in the bellies of Twelve Gods , sir . Prisoner has stopped moving . It 's been moving at a steady pace for hours . Hopefully the damn things is collapsed . Without the water source it could be succumbing to dehydration . Exactly . Still ... I 'm going in . - Alert me of any movement . - Of course . Be careful , Centauri . Can you give me a tracer signal ? Got it . Clea , my grid . What is it , Centauri ? It 's the tracking device . Tore it out of it s own throat . Very clever . It can 't have gone far . You cannot ... Do you hear me ? I bringing you in . Dead or alive . Centauri , are you all right ? Centauri 7 ? Please answer . Clea ? It 's been toying with me . How long have I been out ? Clea ? The head . I had to kick the head ! Hold on to that ! Hello ? Unknown user , please identify . Repeat , identify . Identify . Horn Jericho . Unauthorized user . Terminating access . - Private channel opened . - Clea ? - Where are you ? - I 'm not sure . I 'm in the possession of an unauthorized user . - Can you give me a signal of your location ? - Of course . Got it . He tried to access me but I terminated the communication . - It spoke to you ? - Yes . - And it understood you ? - Yes . This damn thing is smarter than I thought . Keep that signal going . Stay on the private channel . I 'm on my way . Clea ? Clea ? She won 't be helping you anymore . We can 't get off this planet without her . - How I do use her ? - You can 't . And if you harm her , you 'll be stuck on this floating rock as well . You got nowhere to go . Maybe I 'm not planning on going anywhere . If you want a die kill yourself now and save me the trouble . What if I want to take you with me ? Ah . You would have done that already . You are not as dumb as you look . What i s it you want ? I know you can still hear me . You want to play games ? Well , here is mine . I know why they want you brought in . And I don 't care . I 'm gonna hunt you down and I 'm gonna kill you . That 's my game . Give up , Sedonian . You 'll never catch me . You 've been outsmarted and outrun . Go home . Why you still got a home to go back to . I know something new I hate about your race . You don 't pack enough water . Because that 's more of a human thing - always be prepared . I 'm actually surprised you Sedonians have lasted as long as you have , seeing how incompetent you all are . Now I know why they put that helmet mask on you . You talk too much . They didn 't want anyone to know I could speak your language . They were right . It 's ... to speak the language of the stars . Something we picked up from the Draks . Draks are a noble race . You wouldn 't know anything about that . Noble ? They are a disease on the galaxy , filthy creatures . That 's funny . They say the same thing about you . Lying bugs . I 'll tell you this : no one 's gonna miss you guys when you 're gone . You 're the race that 's extinct , human , not mine . Not for long . - Is that so ? - Yap . I 'm taking you all to hell . Alright , hold your ... fantasy , human . Being that you the last of your kind , how do you hope to accomplish this remarkable feat ? - Don 't you know why ? - Don 't care . That 's why . You went to this war on your own ... , and lost your whole world . - Those are the consequence . - We didn 't enter this war . You attacked us . - You were harboring Draksian fugitives . - You mean refugees . Big difference . They need our help . You chose the wrong side . No . It costs us everything but we chose the right side . Now , it 's gonna cost you everything . We all die . That 's your solution . How can you be so naive ? Another pack soon will rise up in our place . An endless cycle . The only way to break it is to take control from those with power , to rule them instead . - You thought about this ? - No . It 's just the way it is . Maybe you 're right . Human . You have two options . You can come with me and survive or you can join to the rest of your race in oblivion . It 's your decision . I choose option number three . Which is what ? Clea ? Clea ? You there ? - Centauri 7 ? - Yeah , it 's me . - Has the human been recaptured ? - No . Then how did you retrieve me ? The radio was sitting on the skeleton . Why would he leave it behind ? Odd , that creature is cunning , dangerously so . I can 't figure this one out . But what the hell is he doing ? I 'm missing something . - I wonder ... - Wonder what ? Clea ? Centauri , I may know what the human is doing . Great , tell me . - It would be better if I didn 't . - Why is that ? If you know , it might influence your actions . I don 't ... What ? - Do you trust me , Centauri ? - With my life . Then here 's what I need you to do ... We may have another problem . - What now ? - I think my fall with Commander Karza did more damage to my internal circuits than I first thought . - What do you mean ? - My battery isn 't holding the power cell charge very well . I 'm not going to be able to conserve enough power to activate your beacon when the rescue ship arrives . Shut down the other systems draining power . I have , the two main sources left are my system 's memory and your medical unit . I 'm afraid you have to shut me down until you need me , Centauri . That 's not happening . Cut my meds . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Cut them . Meds unit shutting down . Your pain receptors are spiking ... - ... and your heart rate is increasing . - I 'm good . That should give us enough power provided the ship arrives at the designated time . With my luck , I wouldn 't count on it . - I 'm picking up communications from orbit . - Our pick-up ? No , these aren 't military channels . An unknown craft is approaching . - They 're coming down here ? - Yes . However my system can 't track it . Try raise them . No response . They 've gone into radio silence . That can 't be good . Maybe some rendezvous for the human . Maybe he 's not the last one . Or they could be Draksians . Great . Hey ! You speak ! What ? What ? Sedonian ... Money ? Sedonians ? They 're paying you . You 're a bounty hunter . That is such an ugly word . Soldier of fortune more like it . Say , they want you be alive . Just as I thought . Slyeck . What would a Slyeck be doing here ? Bounty hunter . Alpha base must have sent him as backup . Idiots ! - Alpha base or the Slyecks ? - Both . What are you going to do ? He 's got my weapons and my prisoner . I 'm gonna go get them back . True , your kind built world bomb ? Maybe . True or lie ? True . Deserve it they do . Scare them good , you do , ah ? - You like Sedonians ? - No one like Sedonians . Invade every planet , make slaves . Their way or no way . If I kill you , they all die . No more Sedonians . - Wait . Remember ? I 'm money . You kill me , no money . Maybe I take you to ship first . Talk with elders . Good idea . Smart . No ! To ... with that money ! I be hero . - No more Sedonians ! - No , wait . You have no business here , Slyeck . That human is my prisoner . He 's mine . I don 't think so . Now what ? We wait . For what ? Extraction . Ship should be here soon . What do they call you , human ? What is your name ? Jericho . Lieutenant Orn Jericho . Lieutenant ? We 're the same rank . I 'm Centauri 7 . Didn 't ask . Not wise to upset me considering your position , human . No wonder your kind didn 't make it . - No common sense . - Oh , was that the reason ? I thought it was your genocidal war that did it . War is war . You lost . As long I 'm still alive , the war ain 't over . You never did answer my question . How were you going to destroy my planet ? - Are . - What ? You said were . Past tense . It 's are . All right . How are you going to destroy my planet ? We sent a ship towards your planet filled to capacity with ... payload . Once it impacts , your world is blown to dust . Our long-range scanners will detect it far before it reaches our atmosphere ... It 's cloaked . You 'll never see it coming . Another trick we picked up from the Draks . So , that 's why they want you alive . - They want to get the ship 's coordinates out of you . - They 'll try . But you 'll die first . That 's right . Well , there 's no reason to keep you alive . - I could kill you right now . - You could . - But ? - Come on . Everybody wants to be a hero . There 's that one glimmer of hope that you might be able to save your world . I told you , I don 't care . They can go to the twelve hells . I don 't believe you . Centauri , I have an incoming transmission . Patch it through . Commander Karzo , this is the battleship Aurora . - Do you copy ? - Copy that , Aurora . Karzo is dead . This is Lieutenant Centauri 7 as acting commander . Copy that , Lieutenant . We have arrived at the last known signal point from the Prometheus before you went down . We 're waiting for beacon locations . Clea , activate personal beacon . - Signal initiated . - Aurora , do you have it ? Affirmative . It 's weak but we should be able to hone in on it . We 're now in route . - ETA - 15 minutes . - Roger that . Centauri 7 out . When we get back to Sedonia they 're gonna torture you . They 'ill get the information they want . You won 't last . - The planet won 't even be there by the time we arrive . - That soon ? And all this ? Just a wild chase to give your ship the time it needed ? It 'll get there long before we do . My planet 's full of people that are innocent ? They are not responsible for the war or your planet 's destruction . - Our High Counsel is . - You all follow blindly . - That 's no excuse . - It 's the law . What the Gods have decreed . Your Gods are telling you to wipe out entire worlds ? No , we spread our knowledge to the stars and surrounding races . By slaving and destroying them . If they don 't accept our way of life , then yes . You make me sick . This from a race that couldn 't even defend themselves against each other , let alone an invading army . Only an ignorant species would war against its own kind . Shut up ! You commit mass murder on a galactic scale and you think it 's a holy crusade . It is our way ! Unless someone comes along and takes control away from them . Your words , not mine . That will never happen . I wonder why . You were right . I do care about my world . I have a wife and child there . I would like to see them again . Our women don 't fight . They nurture the children . Our soldiers are up there . As one warrior to another , I respectfully ask that you take this war to those responsible . You 'll just be killing women and children . Is that what you want the legacy of your kind to be ? Vega sector , gamma quadrant . - Is that ... - It 's where the ship is . Call your people . I 'll give them the coordinates . You better hurry . You don 't have much time . Clea ? Patch me to the Alpha base . Transmitting . Alpha base , this is Lieutenant Centauri 7 . Do you copy ? Copy Lieutenant . What is your status ? Prisoner is in custody and willing to give the coordinates of the bomb ship . Lieutenant , we are ready for prisoner 's information . Please relay immediately . - What are the coordinates ? - No . I want to be the one that tells them . - The coordinates are 22 ... - Unauthorized user . Clea , authorize the human . - State your name . - Orn Jericho . Orn Jericho now authorized . The coordinates are 22 - 9 , 7-13 , 0-40 , bearing 2-6-0 . Vega sector , gamma quadrant . It 's an M-class star freighter . We have confirmation : craft has been identified . - Sending battleships to intercept . - We found it . Well done , Lieutenant . We no longer have need of the prisoner . You may terminate at will . Roger that . Centauri 7 out . They want me to terminate you . I saved your world , your family . Not really . I don 't have any wife and children . Well , that 's good , then you won 't have anything to worry about when your planet 's blown to bits . You didn 't think I 'd give you the real coordinates , did you ? But we have confirmation on the craft . It 's a decoy , you idiot . Unmanned . There 's nothing but salvage on that ship . You can 't stop this . It 's already over . Superior race , ha ? I 'd give you some advice , alien . Never let your weapon fall into the hand of your enemy . I 'm gonna let you in on a little secret . We never launched the bomb ship . We couldn 't . We had no idea where Sedonia was . But now that I 'm authorized to access your database , she 's gonna tell me everything I need to know . You think I forced us to crash down here by accident ? You wanted the bomb ship , I led you right to it . Now you 're gonna learn what it feels like to be the last one of your kind . You want to know the difference between you and me ? I did have a wife and son back on Earth . Centauri 7 , this is the Aurora . We have just cleared the ... and entered the atmosphere . Shuttlecraft is on its way down . Stand by . Centauri 7 , this is Commander Kane of the Aurora landing party . We are on the ground . What is your status ? Centauri 7 , are you picking up my transmission ? Centauri 7 , do you copy ? The only one that made it , huh ? You look like hell . Must have been a rough one . We 'll get you into the infirmary right away . Clea , upload the coordinates to Sedonia to the ship 's nav computer . Clea . Clea , I command you to respond . Son of a bitch . Alpha base . This is ... Commander Kane is no longer responsive . Startup sequence complete . Clea 19 , series Gamma , online . - Hello Centauri 7 . - Hello Clea . It 's good to have you back . I take it by my new casing that you followed my instructions . Well played . It was you he was after . Centauri , I have an incoming transmission from Alpha base . Patch it through . Lieutenant , this is Alpha base . What in twelve hells is going on down there ? If I were you , I 'd be more concerned about what 's going on up there . Centauri 7 , you are under orders . What is the status of the human ? Find another grunt to do your dirty work . Centauri 7 out . End transmission . Whatever you 're planning to do , Centauri , I suggest you to do it quickly . It won 't be long before the human traces the source of that signal back to Sedonia . He already has . Isn 't that right ? You didn 't shoot . Why ? Same reason you didn 't kill me . Yeah , what 's that ? I 'll tell you when I see you . And how are we supposed to get out of here ? Bounty hunter 's ship has to be around here somewhere . You realize we 'll be breaking 26 High Council 's laws by taking this course of action . Is that a problem ? - Not at all . Let 's get to twelve hells off this rock .

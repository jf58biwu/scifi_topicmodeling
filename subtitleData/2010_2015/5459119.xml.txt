 Previously on Touch ... We 're missing a few seconds of Teller outside of room six . Amelia ... Ten minutes later he was dead . Sheri , what can you tell me about the patient in room six ? Jake keeps going AWOL and ending up there . Wondering who 's inside . No one . The room 's empty . They say that the shortest path between two points is a straight line . But what happens if that path gets blocked ? When sediment impedes the flow of a river , it redirects ... zigging and zagging instead of following a straight course . _ _ _ What looks to the crow like meandering , is to the water the most efficient route from source to outlet . Nature finds a detour . Ave Maria , piena di grazia , signor . Sir ! Sir , sir , excuse me . I think you dropped something . Ham radio has what , three working parts ? I told them the tube was loose but nobody listens . Thanks , though . You 're welcome . When two points are destined to touch but a direct connection is impossible ... the universe will always find another way . Would you mind watching Jake . I forgot his ... hat . Come on , guys . Let 's light a fire . Are you okay ? Yeah , about a year ago I took Jake to the Science Museum . I spent the better part of three hours trying to talk him out of a stall in the men 's room . I 'm just not sure about today . For you to even have a dog in the custody fight against your sister-in-law , Jake 's gonna need to show progress . Right now he lives in a world of his own making . Experiences like today push the boundaries , but we don 't grow if we stay comfortable . We 're not just talking about Jake now , are we ? Clea , you guys coming or what ? Okay , buddy . You ready ? It 's time to get going . What is it ? The pattern . The company your sister-in-law works for . Aster Corps . It 's the same symbol . It can 't be a coincidence that Jake keeps landing on a triangle . Okay , buddy , stay where I can see you . Good , all seven present and accounted for . That 's right , we 're one down . I keep forgetting room six is still empty . Who did you say was in there last ? I didn 't . Jake ! Jake , stop ! I 'm so sorry . My son , he runs away from me . Not to worry . I remember when mine was that age . - Enjoy the museum . - Thank you . Check it out . She 's waving at that boy . She can see him . I read about this , it 's a live shot of Paris . This isn 't my phone . 555-0101 ? Hello ? I 'm sorry . Look , I think I have a pretty good idea how this happened . My son must have picked it up . We 're in the first exhibit hall . We 'll wait for you here . You 're welcome . Jake . What are the chances you had something to do with that ? Oh , my God . It 's all right , buddy . We 'll just go look at something else . I spy something red . - I 'll get her back . - Okay . Just calm down . Jake , Okay , it 's gonna be all right . Jake ... Yeah , I can see you . Can you see me ? Jake , I 'll take care of this . I 'm sorry to bother you , but could you ask your friend to grab the lady with the red coat ? Please , it 's important . He needs to speak to the woman in the red coat . See , buddy , look , someone 's going to get her . Jake , please ... See , buddy ? She came back . Jake , I don 't know what you want me to do right now . Here she is . Hello ? I 'm sorry ... - I don 't speak French . - I do . Excuse me . I think you have my phone . I 'm so sorry , my son has a thing for cell phones . That 's okay . Thank you . Excuse me ... by any chance is your name ... Simrin ? Yes . I 'm sorry , do I know you ? No , but I think she does . I 'm sorry . This can 't be happening . I 'm so sorry . No . No . What the hell just happened ? She says ... she thinks that was her mother . But her mother died 21 years ago . Veronique 's birth mother died when she was an infant . All she got was one picture and her mother 's name . Sounds pretty far-fetched . It 's been more than 20 years . I told you before , these numbers , patterns , they 're not just coincidence . _ _ She says ... Simrin isn 't a common Indian name . The birthmark on her cheek . She 's the right age . Damn it . Jake ... I want to follow the road map , I do . But there isn 't a number this time and I don 't understand what the triangles mean . And today 's a really important day for us , too . I-I just can 't leave . Maybe Clea 's right . I mean , we can 't be certain that this is her mother . I mean , it 's been 20 years . Jake ... It 's her mother . How can you be sure ? I just am . You look after Jake . Tell her I 'm gonna try and find her . Hello Tri-Borough drivers , you fine specimens of humanity . That 's right , Sal Slaykoff is back from breakfast ... and it was delicious . Thanks for asking . Funny thing happened to me on my way back from Diego 's Chicken and Waffle House . Total stranger took a moment out of his busy day to do me a solid . Found something I 'd lost . We 're all moving forward in this big , crazy world . Each of us in our own little box . Wouldn 't kill you to make a bit of human contact . Keep that in mind next time you pick up a fare . Anybody copy ? What am I talking to myself here ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Veronique ... my God , what ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Finding her alive would change everything . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Hey , Ipolita . The suit with your comm gear is taking the next space walk . Gratzi , Allegra . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Damn it . Jake . What the hell are you doing ? This running off has to stop . It is not safe . I tried to find her , okay ? I couldn 't ; I 'm sorry . We need to go back inside before they notice that we 're gone , okay ? Come on . Now . Tell me Jake 's with you . Yeah , I 've got him . We 're on our way back . Jake ! Sweetheart , what is it ? - Is he all right ? - Yes , thank you ; he 's fine . - You free ? - Hey . Jackass . You 'll make two stops before dropping me off at JFK . I have a 10-2 at 35th and Ninth . Copy , that 's your last fare of the day . Jake , I don 't know what you want me to do . I tried to find her , but I couldn 't . You know what ? I 've got an idea . - Clea . - Hey , it 's me . The mother , Simrin , her cell phone ... when it rang , do you remember what I said the incoming call was ? It-it started with 555 . I think it was 0101 ? I think that 's it . 555-0101 . Yeah , I think that 's what it was . Look , I want to try something . We 're gonna be a minute ; Okay , thanks . 555-0101 . Hotel Trio , how may I help you ? Come on , buddy . Excuse me , I 'm looking for a woman . She called me earlier from the hotel . Jake . Jake . Damn it . Hey , little man . Are you lost ? Jake . I 'm sorry , it 's my son . I 'll take care of it . Nice job on the SARJ inspection . Install your camera , and we 'll move on . What ? No smoke break ? You want to wrap this up in under six hours , I suggest you head to S1 zenith for the RPCM swap . Roger that . Hey , hey . Give me a glove check . Pristine . Good , ' cause one cut could really put a damper on your day . Says the woman sitting inside . Translating . Can you verify the HUD compares well with the DCM ? Okay , I know men aren 't known for their multitasking abilities , but I really need a check on your suit 's data . How do you read ? Gio , do you read me ? Gio , do you read me ? Um , sorry , is there something I can help you with , sir ? Veronique , right ? I 'm sorry , my name is Nandu . How is that possible ? I just saw you ... - Are you a guest in this hotel ? - No , no , no , please just hear me out . I think I met your sister , your twin sister . I 'm sorry , I 'm an only child . Look , I 'll just call the front desk . Wait , do you have any family in France ? Paris ? No , I was born in India and I moved here before I was one . Please , just call your mother . Her name 's Simrin , right ? How do you know my mother 's name ? She lost her cell phone , I found it . She called me from this hotel . I know this sounds crazy , but I think I 'm supposed to reunite you and your sister . I told you , I-I don 't have a sister . What if I can prove to you that you do ? _ There you are . Where 's Jake and Mr. Bohm ? Uh , checking out an exhibit upstairs . Well , we 're taking off in 20 . Don 't want to be late for the surprise back at the Board Care . The exhibit , the video wall , it 's sponsored by the same group that donated the Beta-tablets to Board Care , Aster Corps . Is it ? I hadn 't noticed . Where are you ? We 're leaving in 20 minutes . I know , I know , look , I need you to call Veronique . I have her on the other line . Okay , good . I want you to ask her where she was born ; The more specific , the better . Okay , give me one second . - In a town called Akaltara . - Okay , thanks . You said you left India before you were one ? Were you born in a town called Akaltara ? It 's just got to be a coincidence . Ask Veronique what her birth date is . May 1 , 1991 . That 's your birthday , isn 't it ? You share the same birthday ; You 're from the same town . There are coincidences , and there are truths . For some reason , I was meant to connect you and your sister today . Please , just let me take you to her . Sometimes twins share allergies . Ask Veronique if she 's allergic to something . You 're scaring me . Don 't leave , ple ... She 's allergic to strawberries . Damn it . We 're on our way back . Jake , we need to go back to the museum , or I 'm gonna be in really big trouble . I apologize again for having to meet on the fly , as they say , but , um , I wouldn 't want to miss my flight . No , of course not . You 're a miracle worker , Dr. Knox . Oh , well , there 's a great deal of suffering in the world , but if I can help to ease even one person 's pain , well , then I 've served a greater purpose . When we spoke on the phone ... Oh , right . Of course . By this time next week , you will be a different woman . Hey , 5 : 30 a.m. shift , la , la , la . That 's the fat lady singing . You 're shift 's up ; Time to bring those rides home . Hang up your keys , take a shower , hit the bodega on the way home and buy some flowers for the wife . Fly free , little birds . I 'm stuck here in this cage . Let me live vicariously through you . Nobody listens . Tell her I 'm sorry . But the phone number ? Didn 't you reach Simrin ? It 's complicated . I 'm allergic to strawberries . Is it possible that we have met ? Maybe I 've driven you before . Doubtful . I avoid this city like the plague . I 'm here on business for the day , that 's all . What is it you do ? Obstetrician . Work can be difficult when you 're away from the family . For every man shall bear his own burden . That 's what I used to tell my little one . Although she is not so little anymore . Yeah , I 'll tell you what , why don 't you just focus on the road so I don 't have to pretend to be interested in anything you have to say . I lied to Sheri . After Jake slipped out , she asked where you are . Come on , troops . Drop your stuff and meet up at the rec room . We got a surprise for you . Did she buy it ? Yeah . But for the rest of the day , she needs to see you here . Jake 's evaluation hearing is just around the corner . I know , I know . No more meltdowns . Seeing ... Veronique and Nandu together today , it was ... The way it should be . I know . I ... - better go help Sheri . - Okay . We 'll be right in . Come on , buddy , it 's our turn . Thank you . What am I missing ? Jake , the triangles . I know . We did that . Veronique , Nandu , Simrin . They were the triangle , and we brought them together . Isn 't that what you wanted me to do ? Jake ... Jake , just calm down . I just don 't know if I can do this . It 's a fait accompli . - I-If anyone ever found out ... - And how would they do that ? I mean , there 's no ties binding you to me , me to her , us to them . Why do you think I had you meet me here ? Like I said ... no ties . We 're playing with people 's lives . Well , you should 've considered that before you cashed the check . 1604 , this is dispatch . Your shift ended 20 minutes ago . Service is waiting on your vehicle . Listen ... you 're right not to be taking the situation lightly . We 're not God , but ... have no doubt that we are helping people . You ... are helping people . Pull over . My esteemed colleague will be getting out here . Then you can take me to JFK , International Departures . Capcom comm check . Gio , do you read ? He 's too focused on the task . Allegra , do you have visual ? Negative . It 's possible Gio translated into an area where structures are blocking your signals . Readjustment already in process . Go ahead and keep your scheduled rendezvous . Are you kidding me ? I think the current situation warrants I cancel and continue to try and ... We 'll assume I.V. from the ground . Take another stab at reestablishing comm . Roger that . We 're about to join a Webcast being streamed to schools and libraries all across the country . Now , seeing that we spent the day at the museum exploring space , I figured why not bring a little space home with us . We good to go ? Hello , Earth . Greetings from the International Space Station . My name is Allegra , and my partner Gio and I have spent the past two and a half months up here working on a range of space observation studies . We also do housekeeping . And that 's where Gio is right now , actually . He 's outside , fixing a piece of the ISS- - that 's kind of like a circuit breaker . I know that he would love to talk to you himself , but unfortunately , communication is down temporarily . Comm blackouts are normal . As a matter of fact , once every orbit , the ISS loses all contact with Earth as we pass through the Zone of Exclusion . It 's kind of like when you wear earbuds to tune out your parents . Okay , today 's topic is radio communication . Currently , I am orbiting 400 kilometers above Earth , while simultaneously talking to a capsule communicator in Houston and our Webcast server in New York- - three distinct , individual points , connected . These two ... by 5,191 miles . We call it " triangulation . " In this case , an isosceles triangle where two sides are identical . That 's because right now , at this very moment , the distance between the ISS and Houston - and the ISS in New York is exactly the same . - 5,191 . What ? May 1 , 1991 . That 's Veronique and Nandu 's birthday , Who can figure out , remember ? Based on my two equidistant sides , what the missing piece of my triangle is ? The top angle is 18 degrees . Cat 's cradle and the triangles are what brought us here , but the number that she 's talking about , that 's what Jake wants me to know , that 's why he was still playing the game . 1-6-0-4 . 1-6-0-4 . Did anybody get that ? What does it mean ? I don 't know yet . The only people that do are part of the triangle . I need to talk to Veronique or Nandu . I need to go . But ... Sheri , she 's watching . You want to see another meltdown ? I don 't have a choice . I 'm gonna have to cut our chat short , kids . I hope that someday I 'm down there talking with one of you up here . Ciao . Houston , are you getting this ? Extravehicular One 's reading elevated for CO2 . We have to purge his suit immediately or he 'll enter hypercapnia . Please tell me you 've regained comm . Negative . Comm is still down . Gio ... I need to know if the number 1604 means anything to you or your sister . How did you ... Yeah , my father , he 's a taxi driver . It 's his medallion number . I 'm gonna need to speak with your father , please . It 's important . I was reduced to some pathetic hand-holding , but the transaction 's complete . I 'm off to Korea right now to shore up the third package . Problem ? Please . These people are desperate . Hey ! What part of JFK did you fail to grasp ? I know who you are . And I know what you 're doing . I 'll call you back . Ah , yes . Every so often I run into one of you people . So you do , eh ? You do remember me ? No . But , then , I 'm terrible with faces . I won 't let what happened to my family happen again . I 'm taking you to the police . We can 't put spilled milk back in its bottle , brother . You are a leech ... feeding off people 's desperation . It 's wrong ! You made me give up my child . I furnish a service , nothing more . I 'm simply a conduit , providing people with the ... happy lives they deserve . Now , the best thing for all concerned would be for you to finish your fare and then go about your life . My life ? You took my life from me . Every action has its consequence . No ! How can I possibly face her ? It 's too late . 20 years of a lie . How could she ever forgive me ? I can 't promise you that she will . But your daughters are reunited , and there 's nothing that you can change about the past , but the future ... that 's an entirely different story . Veronique . It 's a beautiful name . Yeah . How did this happen ? We were just 18 when Simrin discovered she was pregnant . We couldn 't look after ourselves , let alone a child . We hitch-hiked to a free clinic when she went into labor . An hour later , we had Nandu . Pink and healthy . Wait , you didn 't know there were twins ? Not until the doctor told Simrin to get ready to push again . We could scarcely provide food and shelter for one child , but two ? He said ... he could give our baby a better life , and with the money he could give us we could move far away , start over . He wouldn 't even let us hold our baby . So we packed our bags And we moved to New York . The secret we carried , it tore us apart . He took our daughter for profit . And now he 's doing it again . What do you mean ? I didn 't recognize him at first , but with each stop we made , everybody he spoke to , the plans he was making for today , I realized ... the doctor who sold Veronique on the black market , he was sitting in the back of my taxi today . He was mapping the sale of another child , like he was making a grocery run . You 're absolutely positive ? You 're certain that that was the same man ? Yes . I thought I could ... stop him from destroying another family . But I failed my daughters all over again today . Where did you drop him off ? We didn 't make it that far , but he was going to JFK . I need to know every stop you made with this man . EV1 's metabolic rate is rising . We 'll have to get him to airlock and terminate for high CO2 levels or ... EV 's are trained to recognize the symptoms of euphoria . He could make his way back under his own steam . You don 't know Gio . Ipolita . No , the suit . It 's fitted with updated comm gear we were set to test today , including a Ham Radio . It 's low-tech , but worth a try . Stick with procedure . We still haven 't ruled out ISS structural blockage , and we 're two minutes away from loss of signal . Copy . Two minutes away from the Zone of Exclusion . We won 't have any comm for ten minutes , which is exactly why ... Let us give it one more try from down here . EV1 , this is Capcom . If you read , start making your way back to ... Houston ? Houston , do you read me ? Hello ? Excuse me . My lucky piece ! Everything okay ? Yeah , I 'm just trying to finish what Jake started . Is he still ... ? Playing the game ? Yeah . Okay , I 'll be back as soon as I can . We need to have a conversation . Is everything okay ? I know Jake and Mr. Bohm weren 't in the museum for large parts of today . You lied to me , Clea . I just want you to know that I 'm gonna take this to the review board . We need to figure out what to do with you . I thought we were going to have a conversation . Excuse me ? I 'm just saying , you 're not the only one with questions . When I asked you if there was anyone in room six , you said no . Were you lying to me , Sheri ? - Oh . - Idiot ! Watch where you 're going ! Your Italian is as trashy as you are . You are an idiot ! Sorry . I didn 't read you . Say it again . Break . Break . IT1SS hailing any available station . I repeat . Mayday . Mayday . Well , I 'll be a son of a ... CQDX , this is the International Space Station . Please respond . Over . Mayday . I repeat , Mayday . IT1SS hailing any available station . I repeat , Mayday . Mayday . Break . Break . This is KG2DDD . Over . KG2DDD . Over . Do you read me ? The vacuum tube ! KG2DDD . Over . Do you read me ? Roger that . This is India Tango One Sierra Sierra- - The International Space Station . Holy crap ! I 'm talking to space ! Kilo Golf Two Triple Delta , you read me ? Loud and clear . Dr. Knox . - Do I know you ? - No . But I know you . Triple Delta , you copy ? If your coordinates are correct , this should connect me to your guy . Let 's do this . Switching over now . KG2DDD with urgent relay from IT1SS . Do you copy ? Do you copy ? Gio . Come on , buddy , you got to hear me ! Yes . This is KG2DDD . Have you five by five . Go ahead . Yes ! I mean , you need to head to airlock . IV needs you to terminate for high CO2 levels immediately . Affirm . Wilco . NA1SS returning to station now . Two cans and a string- - of all the things in the suit to work , her ham radio . I don 't know who you are , but I owe you a beer . You don 't owe me a thing . Just tell me this . How do we look from up there ? Beautiful . Don 't believe we 've met . We haven 't . But I know all about the way you prey on the lives of desperate people for profit . There must be some mistake . Perhaps you 're confusing me with someone else . No mistake . The taxi driver recognized you . It 's hard to forget the face of the man who stole your child . I 'm sorry , but this- - it 's-it 's farcical . I 'm merely an obstetrician , nothing more . Now , seeing as you have no proof to back up your slanderous claims , I must be going . I think I have all the proof I need , starting with the fraudulent adoption documents you 're holding , and an eyewitness who 's willing to testify that he altered those documents after he received payment from you . No one has the right to separate a child from a parent they love . Nobody . Hello Tri-Borough drivers , you fine specimens of humanity . You wouldn 't believe me if I told you what happened to me today . What 's that ? You want to hear it anyway ? Well , you know all of that so-called junk I got up here on my dispatch box ? Today , I used it to save the life of an Italian astronaut . Seriously ? That 's incredible . Wait till you hear this story , guys . If two points are destined to touch ... the universe will find a way to make the connection . Even when all hope seems lost ... certain ties cannot be broken . They define who we are . And who we can become . Across space ... across time ... along paths we cannot predict ... nature always finds a way . Hey , buddy . I want you to know , everything worked out . Jake , I ... I need you to know that you made a difference . Together we changed things . Do you want me to make the next move ? Okay . What 's wrong ? I 'm off Jake 's case .

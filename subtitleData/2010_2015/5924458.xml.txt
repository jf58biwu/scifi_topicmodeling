 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... - ( EKG FLATLINING ) - MAY : You saved Skye 's life . What is it ? MAY : Why aren 't you happy about it ? COULSON : Being down there , seeing where I came from , I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did . MAY : Agent Ward and I have been having sex . - COULSON : If it 's a problem ... - I 'll end it . JIMMY : I just gotta grab something real quick . I 'll be right back , my love . ROOSTER : Hey , look at that . Hey , darling . Gal like you could have any man you want . Why 'd you marry that little dude ? He loaded ? He 's not my husband . I took him from his bride earlier today . I needed him to provide safe passage . You in trouble ? 'Cause if you need a place to lay low for a while , this is as good as any . - ( BIKE ENGINE REVVING ) - Oh . What kind of beast is that ? - ( GASPS ) - It 's a 1987 Heritage Softail . You can hop on mine if you wanna feel it roar . Hmm , how grand . What is your name ? My men , they call me Rooster . You have men ? You are their leader ? ( CHUCKUNG ) Last time I checked , yeah . Hmm . ( HYPNOTIC VOICE ) You and your men now serve me . - This guy bothering you ? - No . He 's with me now . What ? No ! I 'm with you . You said we 'd be together forever . Remember ? I said we 'd be together till the end . It is the end . ( SCREAMING ) ( MEN MURMURING ) Who are you ? I 'm Lorelei . Now , introduce me to all of my men . ( KNOCKING ) - No ! What did I say ? - ( SIGHS ) Damn it . Every time . It 's like you have a sensor for whenever my butt lifts off the bed . - Back in it . Now ! - I just wanna stretch my legs . Look . There 's color in my cheeks . Breathing without feeling like my whole body 's on fire . I 'm good . " Good " is not the appropriate word to describe your state . You 've been shot twice , had your stomach perforated , and a breathing tube shoved down your throat . " Better " is the more accurate word . Again with the blood drive ? Not gonna have anything left . Not sure how I feel about Dr. Simmons . She 's so strict . Ow , and pokey . Well , patient Skye is unruly and stubborn . And grateful . I hope you know that . I didn 't do it alone . Still , I 'm the most gratefulest-est patient alive . - ( CHUCKLES ) - That 's not even a word . Hey . This a bad time ? ( GROANS ) It is if you 're here to bust me out . ( IN BRITISH ACCENT ) The warden has extended house arrest . ( SCOFFS ) Awful accent . I must look terrible . ( SIGHS ) Simmons won 't even bring me a mirror . I 've seen worse . Wow , thanks . I mean , you look better than when you were dying . - Swingin ' and a-missin ' , Ward . - ( SIGHS ) It 's great to see you better . I was so stupid to go in there alone . Hey , there 's no point in doing that now . You were brave . Thanks to you , every S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the country knows Mike Peterson 's alive . You tell them about his magic leg ? I didn 't call it that , but , yes . Agent Garrett 's running point on Mike . Thinks he 's part of some project called Deathlok . He looked like death . Should 've ... He wouldn 't even look at me . They did something to him . He needs help . He 's past help . He was there with you , Skye . Could 've protected you . He let this happen to you . And I 'll never forgive that . Well , I need to better protect myself . So ... When Simmons gives the all-clear , we 'll start training ? We 'll ease you back into it . No . I wanna train harder . Next time , I don 't wanna depend on some miracle drug to save me . She 's beginning to get suspicious of all the blood I 'm taking . FITZ : No wonder . How many samples have you tested each day ? Not enough . Not enough to find anything . In her blood or Coulson 's . ( SIGHS ) There isn 't ample residue remaining in the vial to examine after we emptied it into her bloodstream . Such a pity you only found the one . Well , excuse me for not sticking around long enough to get blown to pieces . ( SIGHS ) It 's just that the last sample of this miracle drug is inside Skye . - You can 't find any trace of it ? - No . She 's healing at an exponential rate , but I can 't detect anything irregular on a cellular level . And you 've explained to Coulson that you need to upload the samples to H.Q. ? He shut me down . Said to keep it in-house . ( SCOFFS ) I mean , this drug could be a phenomenal breakthrough , could save countless lives . Why 's he being so twitchy ? You were down in the bunker with him . Did you see anything peculiar ? Everything was peculiar . MAN : Director Fury moved heaven and earth . No ! Don 't give it to her ! ( GASPS ) You know , usually when a friend wants a favor , they do something nice . Takes me to a nice restaurant , buys me a bottle of wine . Wanna go to a movie ? Hold hands ? Okay . But I need to ask you a question first . I don 't know where Director Fury is . Don 't be so shocked . For a quiet guy , you make a lot of noise . How many favors have you called in ? Clearly not enough . Something I can help you with ? Fine . But Fury is a high-level agent who 's off-grid . You don 't find him unless he wants to find you . You did something like that once , too , remember ? I never asked you . How was Tahiti ? It sucked . ( CAR ENG I N E STARTS ) New orders . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s detecting massive energy readings in the skies above the California-Nevada border . WARD : Where 's Agent Coulson ? Taking personal time . That 's a couple days straight . SIMMONS : These are the same readings Dr. Selvig and Dr. Foster picked up in New Mexico and in London . They herald the arrival of an Asgardian . - Thor ? - MAY : Not sure . Either way , S.H.I.E.L.D. wants us to be the welcome wagon . Okay . Fine . No cause for concern . Right ? Asgardians are allies . Loki wasn 't . ( SIGHS ) Fitz ? Uh , we 're definitely getting close , but it 's a bit of a crapshoot . This is still science we don 't completely understand . Seems to be a lot of that going around lately . So Coulson hasn 't talked to you ? About why he changed his mind on giving Skye that injection ? No . He 's keeping it to himself . Whoa ! I 'm getting a massive energy surge . Three times the level of the one before . How close ? ( CRASHING ) Yeah . Definitely Asgardian . FITZ : Running facial recognition . ( BEEPING ) Okay , got it . I don 't have a name , but I can confirm she was in New Mexico fighting with Thor and his mates . She 's on our side . Stand down . She 's a friendly . You are of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . I 'm Lady Sif , of Asgard . Your world is in grave danger . She 's a warrior . I saw her fight in New Mexico with Thor . Climbed a giant metal killing machine . Speared it with her double-bladed sword . It was pretty badass . She says she needs S.H.I.E.L.D. to help her find someone . You up for this ? I 'm fine . Fine doesn 't look like this . Not on you . You 've been gone more often than not . Whatever 's bothering you , I 'm here . I know . What dark magic is this ? Thor said you perished at the hand of Loki . And he was right . For a while , anyway . But Loki wasn 't the only one with some tricks up his sleeve . Turns out S.H.I.E.L.D. had a few of their own . Thor will be pleased to hear it . He considers you a friend . I feel the same . Which is why I 'd prefer he hear it from me , if that 's okay . I understand you 're looking for someone ? I am hunting her . Lorelei . 600 years ago , she used her powers to wreak havoc across the Nine Realms . To command armies , bring down kings , empires . What kind of powers are we talking about ? Strength ? Speed ? Sorcery . She bends and shapes the will of men to her own purpose . Only men ? Her powers don 't work on women ? No . Men have an inherent weakness we do not share . I can 't imagine what she 's talking about . The very sound of her voice can ensnare most . For the rare man who can resist , it 's her voice joined by her touch that will overpower his will . COULSON : So how do we stop her ? With this . It prevents her from speaking . She wore one like it for centuries while locked in prison . She escaped when the Dark Elves invaded Asgard , and came here using Loki 's secret pathways between worlds . Do we know where she is now ? All I know is the Bifrost delivered me to her last known location . Mostly small towns out that way . Let 's start looking for unusual activity within a few hundred-mile radius . Burglary , theft , assault . If this woman 's used to ruling over empires , she 's gonna be hard to please . I wanted gold ! You bring me paper ? ( STAMMERS ) It 's cash . It 's like gold . This is the currency here . And who 's this ugly woman ? Uh , that 's , uh , Ben Franklin . Used to be President . He used to rule this whole country . Hmm . And women can rule your land , can they not ? Uh , you 'd be the first . Yes . I will . What the hell , Duane ? - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Move , move ! I have been texting you all day , worried sick ! I thought you were dead in a gutter somewhere . No , no , don 't , baby . There 's nothing to worry about . I just turned off my cell phone , ' cause the noise was bothering Lorelei . Are those my clothes ? Why is this woman wearing my clothes , Duane ? Who 's this Duane she speaks of ? That 's me . My real name 's Duane . She calls me that . - She 's my wife . - Yeah . Oh . Do you prefer her to me ? She 's nobody next to you . " Nobody " ? Really ? " Nobody " owns this bar ! You know what ? Everybody out ! Out ! We are closed ! Out ! I 'm tired of this noise , Rooster . Make it stop . - His name is not Rooster ! It 's ... - ( GAGGING ) I 'm sorry , baby . You 're making too much noise . ( BODY THUDS ) These are files of every police report within 100 miles of where you arrived . Everything from the last 48 hours . When you wanna sift through the information , you just ... - I 'm familiar . - Uh , oh . It 's an antiquated system we and other realms had ages ago . ( SIGHS ) You 've visited other realms . Seen different species , aliens . Have you ever encountered any that were blue ? Yes . Of course . Which ones ? Uh , lnterdites , Levians , Pheragots , Kree , Sarks , Centaurians . The Frost Giants tried to conquer your Earth a millennia ago , but Asgard drove them away . Oh , thanks for that . And the others , have any of them been here recently ? ( SIGHS ) Rest easy , Phillip , Son of Coul . None of the others have ever visited Earth . ( BEEPING ) There . A robbery of jewels . And there . A gun store robbery by guys on Harleys . It 's happening faster than I feared . She 's amassing men , gold , weaponry . Lorelei is building an army . Traced the men to a biker bar called Rosie 's Desert Oasis . Probably where Lorelei 's hiding out . Meeting a S.H.I.E.L.D. convoy there in 10 . Good . Then you can show off these beauties . ( WHISTLES ) These all Night-Night guns ? Based on the same technology , but we 're not calling them that anymore . About time . They 're called ICERs . Incapacfiafing , Cartridge-Emitting ... - ( GUN COCKS ) - They 're great . And you lost the ounce . And I tripled the stopping power . But I did realize after our run-ins with Mike and Centipede ... - Hello . - Sorry . That we needed something stronger . Better . I thought you didn 't like guns . No . I always say if I need a gun , I 'll take one . We 'll need these . When you 're up against people who are being controlled , sometimes it 's hard to distinguish friend from foe . This way we can take out either . Where 's Lady Sif ? Shall we ? Lorelei 's tastes run toward palaces , castles . This is far more humble than her usual abode . The draw wasn 't the place , it was the manpower . How many men does she have in there ? - Have you seen the suspect ? - Yes , we have . And she 's beautiful . - ( SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) - ( SHOTS FIRING ) What is that ? Well , it seems we 've caught the attention of the law . You swore to fight for me . Yeah , and I will . But they got a lot of firepower out there . I mean , hell , they even got some Medieval Times chick . She 's got , like , a sword and everything . Sif . They 're on us from both sides . Pretty hard to get off a clean shot . Your Ladyship , can you give us a little cover ? ( GRUNTS ) Very literal interpretation . Thank you . All clear . Men , stay outside . Let Sif take Lorelei . Ward , head around back . Surround the building . Lorelei . Still manipulating men to do your dirty work , I see . And I see you 're still a step or two behind . You know how this ends , Lorelei . So come willingly . You take me for someone who fears you . I 've bested you before . Or have you forgotten ? Tear her apart . ( GRUNTS ) ( CRASHING ) ( GRUNTING ) Look . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sure you 're a reasonable guy , Rooster . Rooster ? Really ? ( GRUNTING ) You 're a fine warrior . I am . So put your hands behind your back and get on your knees . Men kneel before me . I do not bow to them . I need some backup over here . That is not what you need . Take me somewhere grand . Deserving of a ruler , a queen . I know just the place . ( GRUNTS ) Lorelei 's treachery remains unchanged , no matter the world . We 'll find them . Every agent in the area is out looking . To what end , hmm ? The collar has been broken . Short of death , we have no means to end her enchantment . Let me worry about that . Stay here . And try not to punch a hole in my airplane . So Ward 's , what , like a pod person ? No . According to Lady Sif , the men Lorelei controls don 't forget who they are or what they know . She just becomes the embodiment of all their desires . So , once we find them , we can break her mojo or whatever and get Ward back , right ? Yes . Once the collar 's back on Lorelei 's neck , the enchantment ends . But that 's the problem . The collar caught a shotgun blast back in the desert . Think you can fix it ? Well , the metal , the weight , it 's similar to the Berserker staff . But it presents its own set of countless unknown variables . Got a couple hours . ( GRUNTS ) What can I do ? And don 't you dare say , " Nothing , " or tell me to sit down here and count ceiling tiles while Ward is missing . Ward 's got drop boxes and storage lockers all over the world . They 're filled with currency , weapons , IDs . He 's gonna use aliases , cash , anything to keep Lorelei off the radar . You 're the best radar we have . Find them . Sir , may I have a moment ? It 's about the GH-325 . Have you found something ? No . I 've hit a wall because of my limited resources . The drug 's chemical properties are foreign to me , which is startling in its own right . We 've been over this . So I 'm requesting , once again , to send a sample of Skye 's blood to H.Q. for further study . That 's not an option . Why ? I don 't need to explain to you the benefits of this drug . You 've experienced them first-hand ! No . That 's an order . That 's not a good enough reason ! I have a duty to you , sir , as my commanding officer , but I also have a duty as a S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist to pursue this , to save lives . Given Ward 's recent situation ... Two men laid down their lives in a compound rigged with explosives to keep this drug hidden . We still don 't know why . Until we do , until we speak with Fury and get some answers , that drug and its mysteries stay in-house . Focus on the mission . Lorelei has Ward . And we have no idea where she 's taking him . LORELEI : I am fortunate to have found you . You are quite resourceful . - Just well-trained . - ( CHUCKLES ) No . You are worlds apart from those men in the desert . I 'm not an idiot . I know you value me no more than those bikers back there . The truth is , I don 't care . Because of what you feel . I 've felt something before , for someone on my team . It seems foolish now . I would die for you . Any man would . But I don 't want them . I want you . You 're stronger . A real man with the rage of a Berserker inside . ( HYPNOTIC VOICE ) You will present me with an army . And I will give you a gift in return . ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) When I first arrived here , I thought Earth left much to be desired . But from here , it 's quite beautiful . I 've spent the last 600 years locked away in a dark , cold cell . My throat shackled , my voice silenced . Torture . You never have to go back there . But Sif is on the hunt . She will not rest , she will not stop . I will not know peace . So we take her out of the equation . Eliminate the threat . The graves of Asgard 's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif . Do not make the same mistake . You do not know her . No , I don 't . But the people she 's working with now ? I know them . May I ? ( CHUCKLES ) You have experience with swords ? Yes . But I prefer to use my hands . Admirable . But be warned , Lorelei is quite skilled at combat . Then why co-opt men ? Why have them fight for her ? Well ... ( SIGHS ) I believe it gives her a thrill . Especially if the man is already taken . And besides , even the best warrior needs an army to conquer an empire . So , her pattern remains . She attaches herself to the strongest warriors she can find , and then unleashes a swath of blood and destruction . The man she 's with , Ward , he 's as lethal as any . One of our best . I see . I 've been where you are , Melinda May . A man I cared for , under her spell So enchanted , he forsook his family , his friends , me . Steel yourself to do what might be necessary . - Your Agent Ward ... - He 's not mine . Well , that is certainly true now . But Agent Ward is no longer the man you knew . He will not hesitate to kill you . Ward won 't kill me . Do not let your feelings cloud your judgment . I 'm not . He might try to kill me , but he won 't . Security cameras just caught sight of them . If Lorelei wants an army of wealthy , pliable men , I think she just hit the jackpot . WOMAN 1 : Clear . WOMAN 2 : Bedroom clear . WOMAN 3 : Kitchen clear . Clear . She 's gone . - Turn this suite upside down . - WOMAN : Yes , sir . I know you said you and Ward wouldn 't be a problem . But I also know you wouldn 't tell me if it was . Fitz . There are cameras everywhere in this town . Track ' em all . No sign of them in any surveillance around the city . It was a long shot . Ward knows how we work , knows to avoid cameras . Well , I expanded my search . Got satellite support running . We 'll find them . I do have a bit of good news . I fixed Lorelei 's neck collar . Let me inspect it to be sure . Asgardian metal is much different from the ore of this planet . Sure , but I think you 'll find it 's up to snuff . It 's in your room . You and Ward have the same training , cut from the same cloth . If it was you , where would you run to ? Asgardian metal is so dense , just have to find the right tools , really . But you 'll see . Not a scratch on it . Because , yes , I am that good . Well done . You really are quite clever . ( GRUNTS ) ( POUNDING ) If I was Ward , I wouldn 't run . - ( WHIRRING ) - I 'd take out my main threat . We 're taking off . Why are we taking off ? - What is that pounding ? - ( POUNDING CONTINUES ) I 'll go and investigate . You ... Stay put . I know . ( DOOR RATTLES ) Someone locked us in . - Fitz ! - Sir . Ward and Lorelei are on the bus . Where 's the collar ? And Sif ? In there . That 's why I 'm standing guard . Would not want Sif to get out and hurt Lorelei . Of course , we wouldn 't . And Lorelei wants me to go down to the basement , keep an eye on the girls downstairs . Already locked them in . Cannot have them mucking up Lorelei 's plan . She 's the best . Isn 't she , sir ? Yep . She 's something else . Aren 't you the brave one ? You took my plane . I want it back . Well , we can 't always get what we want . Actually , I can . ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) I will retrieve Sif 's sword . it will look better in my hand . Ward , you don 't want to do this . This was the plan . Cross off Sif , take the plane , eliminate anyone in our way . Get out of her way . It 's her plan . Not yours . Fight it . I know you , you 're a fighter . Is this her ? The beautiful warrior with a heart of ice ? His heart now beats in concert with mine , and mine alone . No reason to make this about us . Oh . He told me who he desired before me . But , my dear , it wasn 't you . Where 's Simmons ? - Oh . - What the hell are you doing ? Sir , are you you ? Of course I am ! Fitz has Sif trapped in the Cage . We need to unlock the door , get her out . What ? Coulson , they opened the airlock . She 's gone . I 'm afraid she was sucked out of the aircraft . Are you kidding ? She 's Asgardian . Sif 's out there . Unlock it . Let her in . You . Come with me . I need your help . ( GRUNTS ) Anything else I can do to be of service ? Okay , good , good . I 'll be right here . Leave me in peace . Return to Asgard . While you remain here ? I think not . FITZ : What 's she doing ? No . Here , I will no longer pose a threat to Asgard . Can you not let me be ? Find some small mercy within your heart ? My heart has no place in this . - I have orders to bring you back . - ( SCOFFS ) All these years and you 're still the same Sif . Doing as you 're told . Heeling at the feet of those who command you . Never to get what you desire ? Not Haldorr . Not Thor , a man who considers you more pet than woman . Hand me my sword , Lorelei . See , there 's the difference between you and I. I don 't take orders . ( GRUNTS ) Stay strong for me , baby girl . You stay strong . ( GASPS ) Simmons . You 're not supposed to be up here . FITZ : Ward ? I think we have a big problem ! ( GRUNTING ) Ah ! ( GRUNTING ) You better get back here , Simmons . You cannot be running about . Okay ? Lorelei does not want any ... - Fitz . - Sir ? ( SIGHS ) Poor thing . He 's always getting knocked out , isn 't he ? ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Ah ! ( SWORD CLATTERS ) ( PANTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Kill me . I 'd rather die than go back to that place . You will not get off that easy . Why ? It 's what you want . I can see it in your eyes . Or would you rather hear about how the man you loved followed me around like a dog ? Hear of his touch , his kiss , the look in his eyes when I ... ( STUTTERING ) You were saying ? - Sorry about this . - ( CLICKS ) Whoa ! Wait , wait , wait . Sorry . It 's me . Okay ? I 'm back . He speaks the truth . Good to know . SIF : My apologies . The damage caused to your flying boat was unfortunate . It 's seen worse . I assure you , Lorelei will be punished severely for the crimes against your people . It must 've been hard for you . After everything she did . To move past it , to let it go . Odin ordered her back alive . As one of his warriors , I bow to his will . Regardless of what it cost you ? Much like your S.H.I.E.L.D. , we are bound by our code . I am honored to have fought by your side . I 'll run diagnostics . See how much damage we 're dealing with . How much are you dealing with ? He didn 't break anything , so ... Not what I meant . You should talk to him . Hash it out . Then you should take your own advice . You 've been sitting on something since the Guest House . If not with me , then with Skye . She deserves to know what you saw down there . I figure , I 'll let you punch me again . Repeatedly . - Just , why don 't you just ... - it 's fine . It 's not . I never intended ... - I didn 't wanna hurt ... - You didn 't . There was never a risk with me . I told you that . You did . Seems like we 're done here . Okay . But if what Lorelei said was true , you were more honest with her than you are with yourself . I 'm not saying you were weak . I 'm saying all men are weak . Sir . I understand why you had to punch me . And I forgive you . Could I get a moment alone with Skye , please ? Yeah . I know that face , and something gives me the feeling I should be sitting down for this . ( SIGHS ) I 've been looking for a way to tell you this . Looking around for some answers , something to help explain ... But I don 't have any . So ... The drug , the one that saved us both ... When we found it , I discovered something else . Its source . It was alien . Alien , as in unfamiliar ? No . Wow . The minute I learned what it was , I tried to keep them from injecting you with it , but I was too late . I 'm so sorry , Skye . You were trying to save my life . You did save my life . I was desperate to , and so I subjected you to unknown ramifications , or side effects . I 'm sorry to say this , sir , but so what ? We are alive . And you 've had that stuff in you for some time now , and you 're okay , right ? Plus you 're not sprouting a pointy tail or anything , so bonus there . I know nothing fazes you , but this should faze you . We 're completely in the dark on this . That 's where we live . I 'm an 084 . Who knows what the hell that means ? At least we 're in the dark together . Yes . But not for long . To hell with any protocols , or any code I used to be bound by . We have a long list of questions we need answers for , and we 're going after them ourselves . Well , if the team 's up for it ... No . No , listen to me . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps . Lied to me , lied to S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret . A secret men died for . Until we know why , we can 't share this with anyone . For their safety , and ours . Got it . So what 'll it be , A.C. ? What do we go after first ? The person responsible for this . And we make him pay . No . No , listen . I trust them , but we need to protect them from this . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps . Lied to me , lied to S.H.I.E.L.D. This is a powerful secret . A secret men died for . Until we know why , we can 't share this with anyone . For their safety , and ours . ( BEEPS ) WOMAN : Encrypted line secure . Agent Melinda May . Update log 93 . He knows . I repeat , Coulson knows .

 Be responsible For the end of the world . We have to get Peter back . Previously on Fringe ... This technology has a very recognizable design . This is William 's technology , but we didn 't build it . Peter is in danger . You have to help us cross over . We don 't have a way to cross over , but you do . We made it . We 're on the other side . Peter , I 've missed you so much . Your father 's so pleased to see you . He asked me to give you this . This is your team ? I understand you 're investigating a fringe event . That 's correct , sir . I have reason to believe that these invaders Are anything but peaceful . They must be found . Run , run , run ! Hey ! Hello , Olivia . Walter is in trouble , and I 'm quite confident We don 't have much time . the grand hotel , Designed by Antonio Gaudi . Built in 1908 . the long island triangle . Fringe event 2461 . A semi-permanent thin spot formed in 1990 . Temporal and spatial distortions are present . This area is off-limits . midtown quarantine . Fringe event 89722 . An unstable wormhole at the Madison square garden That would not close was quarantined by fringe division In 1999 . Due to recent legal developments , The 10,000 citizens encased in quarantine amber Have been recently ruled legally dead . liberty island . Appropriated by the revised eminent domain provision Of the earth protection act in 1989 , Now headquarters of the department of defense . Mr. Secretary . You said anything odd , sir . Yes . Sir , homeland security Received a report of a high-priority individual Being admitted into the E.R. At New York general hospital . Who ? That 's the odd part , sir . It 's you . ? science fiction ? ? ooh ooh ooh ? ? double feature ? It 's Sunday . Day off . 'fraid not . I 'm uploading your assignment now . team 's on the way . We 'll get them , sir , quickly and quietly . Mr. Secretary . Hello , son . I 've imagined this moment so many times . I can 't imagine how strange it must be for you . I 've seen the strange . But this ... This is something else . this is the last hospital before the park . If we don 't find Walter here , We 'll start heading uptown . Okay , well , how do you know that he 's not already in custody ? I 've checked with my sources at homeland security . I don 't believe Walternate 's people have found him yet . " Walternate " ? It 's a nickname Walter gave him years ago . " Walternate . " over here , he 's the secretary of defense . The fringe team answers to him . To Walter ? I know it takes a little getting used to , doesn 't it ? okay , we 're gonna have to refer to the chart . Excuse me . How big were the bees ? This big ? Bigger than a grapefruit ? Excuse me - hey , pal ! If you ain 't bleeding , back of the line . Excuse me , sir , I - I didn 't realize . That 's quite all right . I believe a friend of mine is being treated here . what 's the patient 's name , please ? Bell . Sir ? You go . I 'll buy you some time . You find Walter . I 'll meet you in the parking lot . I 'm sorry . A misunderstanding . okay . give me a second . I 'll find him for you . We 're also gonna need his medical files Purged from the system . Fringe authorization . I purged his file . He 's in bed 18 . Thanks . Uh , excuse me , excuse me . Don 't I know you from somewhere ? I - I have it . You 're agents . Fringe division . You work for the secretary . Sorry , sir , we 're in a bit of a rush . I 'd imagine you would be . Chaotic times , aren 't they ? Chaotic times indeed . I 'm terribly sorry . The secretary and I are old friends . I 'm William bell . I see you 're carrying 76 pulse side arms . I designed those , you know . Uh , I 'm sorry , Mr. Bell , but we have to - The 76 models don 't have the pha repeater . That 's a design flaw . Walter . Olivia . It is you , isn 't it ? Yes , Walter . Prove it . Come on , Walter . We don 't have time for this . Ah ... Yes , it is you . That 's wonderful . Hi . Hi . They also don 't have the pulse function . Which I am putting in the 77 . Excuse me , sir . Okay . Walter , can you walk ? I can dance , if you like . They have absolutely fabulous drugs here , Olivia . I feel great . Oh , and look , look , look . Accelerated healing techniques . It-it 's miraculous . Okay , come on , Walter . Bell 's waiting for us . Bell is here ? Yes . Yes , he is . That 's nice of him to finally show up . Here . Clothes are gone . He was wounded . I 'll lock down the hospital . Are you looking for something ? I need the security footage for this unit . Now . Hello , William . Walter . I see you 've aged . It appears I 'm not the only one . Get in , Walter . Ohh . Hey . You okay ? Looks like you just saw a ghost . Thank you . What 's the red ? That 's the quarantine areas . Boston ? Most all of them . Because of what that man did . The man who stole you . That 's a lot of blame to place on just one man . It 's true , I 'm afraid . When our two universes first interacted , It caused soft spots on the other side . But it was much worse here . The laws of physics were turned into mere suggestions . But I 'm hoping you can change all that . I don 't know what you heard about me , But ... Changing the laws of physics Might be slightly above my abilities . That 's fair enough . But there have been Breakthroughs on the the other side In science and engineering that - That we haven 't achieved yet . And these are things that you understand . The schematic I left with your mother ... Yeah , I looked at them , and ... Whatever it is , it 's unlike anything I 've ever seen before . So what is it ? It 's very old tech . It 's something that ... I believe can be applied To heal the problems of this world ... Of your world . I 've replaced missing parts with new equipment , But , unfortunately , it still doesn 't work . My engineers tell me that the problem Probably lies in the power source . I was hoping that you would have a look at it . Of course I would . Peter , I know it wasn 't easy - Making the choice to come home . But I 'm very glad you did . Sir , Agent Dunham is here . She doesn 't have an appointment . Tell her - Olivia 's here ? Send her in . Agent Dunham . Sir . This is Peter . Sir . Thank you , major . Do I have something in my teeth ? No , you remind me of somebody I know . But your hair is different . Think I like yours better . would you excuse us , please , Peter ? I need to speak to Agent Dunham . I 'll be out in a moment to show you around . Agent . Uh , we lost him At the hospital , sir . We think he had help escaping . That 's not why you 're here , is it ? Uh , no , it is not . I told you there would be invaders Coming over from the other side , But I didn 't tell you they would be us . No , you did not . They 're our doubles , Alternate version of ourselves , But don 't be deceived , Olivia . They 're monsters in our skin . They 'll do anything , say anything to gain our trust , But they can 't be trusted . That man . He knows me . Or her . That 's why he was staring at me . Is he from the other side ? That man ... Is my son . Peter . Your son who was kidnapped 20 years ago ? Yes . Kidnapped by them . Agent ... May I ask a favor of you ? They had cameras everywhere . We must be on the hospital surveillance tapes . Which means we are fugitives . Double breaded for a big crunch . It 's so good . Tastes just like on our side . It was Wednesday , 1983 , When I happened to identify The last of the 11 secret herbs and spices . Walter ... Okay . I think that we should split up . I can look for Peter faster if I 'm on my own . We have a larger pro . Without Mr. Lane and the others , We won 't be able to cross back to our side . Olivia can still open the door . That 's her gift , is it not ? I don 't know how much of a toll Crossing over took on her . You may be able to open a crack , But without the others to enhance your power - That 's it , then . What ? We need a doorstop . Something to hold the door open Where Olivia has already provided a crack . You could build one , Walter . A doorstop ! No ... No , no , no , no . For starters , I 'd need a particle accelerator . I don 't think they exactly sell those At the local drugstore . no . But I think I know where we could get one . oh ! Oh , of course . I 'm sure you opened massive dynamic On this side as well . As a matter of fact , I did not . I did not - To get rich and famous While I was rotting away in a padded cell . Walter , will you please - hey ! Come on , you can work this out another time . Okay , Walter ... You build a doorstop , If you can . I 'm gonna go look for Peter . Now do you have a cell phone ? They monitor all the communications networks . That 's probably how they knew about central park . It 's safest if we don 't try to communicate with one another . We 'll meet back at the opera house in 12 hours . Okay . Be careful . We 've accomplished a lot together , Walter . But she may be our greatest achievement . Hmm . the secretary thinks you 'll be comfortable here . Thanks . So , uh , it 's UV-proof glass . Uh , state-of-the-art anti-fire tech . There 's viral purging , Air filtration , And there 's a gym and a pool upstairs . The secretary 's gonna send a car to pick you up at 8 : 00 , Take you to dinner . What was it like on the other side ? Secretary told me . A lot like it is here . Just ... Slightly different . It 's subtle , but definitely different . You know , when people find out that you 're back ... You 're gonna be famous . What do you mean ? Well , your kidnapping . It 's a famous story . So I 'm like the Lindbergh baby ? The what ? Nothing . What 's she like ? Who ? Me . She 's a lot like you . Darker in the eyes , maybe . She 's always trying to make up for something . Right some imaginary wrong . Haunted , I guess . Maybe she 's nothing like you at all . Thanks for the ride . Of course . Am I responsible for this ? I 'm afraid you are . Of course . At one time , Walternate was intent on finding a means To cross between universes . Just as you were . Heidn 't succeed , but ... It stands to reason the technology we need Might here . Didn 't walternate work with you ? Or , rather , the William be from this side ? Walternate ? No . It seems that William bell on this side Was killed in a car accident as a young man . Over here ... The other you and the other me Ner had occasion to meet . What a shame Imagine how much money you could have made If there were two of you . Creating massive dynamic Was not my idea , Walter . We both talked about borrowing this world 's technologies To help our own . You didn 't help the world , William . You helped yourself . You pilfered this world for profit . As a byproduct , yes . Let 's remember , The only reason I came back over here Was to prevent a war . And to stop a chain of events Set into motion the day you stole Peter ! A little truth , if you please . You say you want to prevent the war While you quietly fuel it . I know th you helped craft The shapeshifters . Your design signature is all over it . I had little choice . If I wanted to keep tabs on walternate , I had to remain valuable to him . I 've lost ... 17 years In a mental institution , William . 17 years ! And even now , I 'm - I 'm still incomplete . I forget things . Uh , names . Places . Connections that I used to be able to make so easily . They just - they just dangle , Just outside of my reach . I know what you did to me . I know that you cut out pieces of my brain . Walter - What kind of man could do that ? You robbed me of my memories of my wife , Of my son , of my past ! Walter ! I believe you 've found what we 're looking for . We should get started . Hmm . How did you - We both leave our hide-a-key in the same place . This should do . With some modifications , this should act as a doorstop . Yes . Now , we need to simultaneously Amply and limit The molecular destabilization margins . Well , we should try not to electrocute everyone In the process . Well ... This will reopen The crack in the door . But without the others , I 'm not sure That Olivia will be strong enough To keep it open . Well ... Leave that to me . Now , I need your help . Well , you have a funny way of asking . Okay , I need you to take me to Peter bishop . I assume that you know where he is . Don 't . It 's getting heavy . Is that mom ? Yeah . She 's alive ? What is she like ? Well , the last few years have been hard for her My sister died during childbirth . You have a sister too ? And a niece . Ella . She 's seven . Ella . I need to speak to Peter bishop . He 's in danger here , And he needs to understand that . This isn 't just an assignment , s it ? Are you two a couple ? is that what this is about Please , I need to speak to him . You gotta trust me . I 'm you . You haven 't answered my question . What question ? Why did you remove my memories ? I had my reasons Belly ... Walter ... Let the past be the past . We have less than four hours to get back . We should go . Will you help me ? Okay . Stop . Stop . I was just getting my keys . Put it down . You ep your backup gun in your purse , don 't you ? I keep mine in my jacket . Now put your gun slowly down on the table . I thought we had an agreement . You know , I don 't know what you are , But you are nothin ' like me . You know , he was right . Call fringe . This is Dunham . Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Unh ! Uhh ! Hey , Liv . I tried your cuff a couple of times . Everything okay ? Yeah . What 's up , Charlie ? Got a power surge at the secretary 's old lab . So Broyles wants us to go and check it out . You sure you 're okay ? The secretary just called . He , uh , he wants us to move Peter bishop . Apparently , he 's not safe where he is . They found Peter bishop ? Yeah . Huh . object is totally unresponsive . But there 's nothing wrong with it . There 's no ... Obvious damage to the structure . And yet ... Somehow it just feels incomplete . All right , this is gonna sound crazy . In fact ... This is kind of crazy . But what if ... The object was symbiotic in nature ? Which is to say that it wasn 't entirely mechanical , That it needed some sort of ... So sort Organic interface ? so how much do you know ? How did they find him ? I don 't know . Wow . After all these years . Can you imagine when the tabloids get hold of this ? You know , I think it has something to do With why these people have come from the other side . Yeah , I suppose so . Have we got any new leads ? No , nothing new . I gotta tell you , Livvy , This job isn 't what it was ten years ago . You got alternate universes . I an , it just - Just wasn 't part of my training , you know ? I mean , how are we supposed to fight these people ? Truth is , Livvy , This makes me feel obsolete , you know ? The parameters are human ... A reflection of the human genome . The spectrum isn 't random . In fact , the specificity of the configuration Would seem to suggest that the object Would only respond to a subset of people . And a narrow subset at that . A subset of one . Me . Charlie Francis . Peter Bishop . It 's pleasure to meet you . Come on in . What can I do for you guys ? Uh , Mr. Bishop , We 're concerned for your safety . What 's this ? This was given to me By an acquaintance of your father . An observer . An observer ? He gave it to me , I think , To warm me about what would happen to you If you ever returned here . What 's going on ? He wants you to know That your friends are here And that they have come to keep you safe . Hey , Liv , what the hell are you talking about ? oh , God . Peter , it 's me . Thanks , I think I just figured that out . He lied to me . He told me I could heal the problems of this world . My father told me that all the problems out there Started when Walter came over and stole me . And that , now that I was back , I was gonna be able to help to fix it . But his bringing me back Was never about fixing this universe . It was about destroying yours . I 'm sorry . How long did you know ? A few weeks . Peter , I - don 't worry . I 'm not gonna let them do this . I don 't think that he can . I mean , not without you . Peter ... You don 't belong here . No , I don 't belong here . But I don 't belong there , either . Yes , you do . I have thought of 100 reasons ... Why you should come back . To-to fight the shapeshifters , To take care of Walter , to-to save the world . But in the end ... You have to come back . Because you belong with me . Colonel Broyles , listen up . I need everyone 's attention , now ! Mr. Secretary . I want all surveillance retasked To find a fugitive . What fugitive , sir ? Me . I 've got her ; her show me just passed The auto scan checkpoint at sector 47 . They 're heading back to the opera house . All right , people , let 's move . This is not a drill . they should be here by now . They 'll be here . Help me get this thing inside . Walter ! Oh , okay . hello , Peter . I 'm William bell . Haven 't seen you in many years . You 're holding up better than I would have thought . What 's a little universe hopping between friends ? That 's not what I meant . Okay , so what do we do ? Peter , help your father get this device Inside and powered up . Olivia and I will hold them off . I supplied fringe division with the 76 model . This is the 77 . Come on . Peter , I don 't even know where to begin . I never meant for any of this to happen . How do we do this , Walter ? Phosphorous grenades . Be careful . They 're prototypes . They could be unstable . What do you mean , unstable ? Just try not to jostle them . Cover me . Ready ? We move on my mark . Yes , Mr. Secretary . I understand . Damn it . Dr. Bell ! Get down ! Dr. Bell . Can you hear me ? Dr. Bell . Ohh . Thank God . What happened ? Uhh . I , uh ... I used a grenade . I think I bought us a few minutes . Come on . Walter , they 're here . Is it working ? Yes . It 's opening a crack in the door , But we don 't have enough power to keep it open . Yes , we can do it . We can 't . Olivia doesn 't have the power , And-and I haven 't thought of a solution . Walter - please don 't argue with me , William ! Always thinking you 're smarter than me . Walter , I will be the power . I 've traveled between universes so many times , My atoms are ready to split apart With the slightest provocation . You taught me there are as many atoms in the human body As there are stars in the sky . That 's how many atom bombs I am . That should be enough power to get you home . I should never have doubted you . It 's okay , Walter . You always were as stubborn As a donkey with a nail in his head . Walter , start the sequence . Thank you , old friend . Walter ... You asked me why I took out part of your brain . I did it because you asked me to . Because of what you were becoming . freeze ! welcome back . Seriously ? This is the third piece , Astrid . Are you trying to kill me ? I 'm sorry . When I 'm nervous , I cook . And I 've been baking pies for about a week . Pies and muffins and cakes . And I 've been eating them all too , So don 't be surprised When I send you a bill for my lap band . I 'm sorry I make you nervous . That 's okay . At least you 're back . You mind giving Walter a ride home ? I think I 'm gonna take a walk . Sure . Good night , Walter . Peter ... You are back now , aren 't you ? You 're-you 're not leaving again ? I 'm trying to see this your way , Walter . I can 't . But ... You did cross universes twice to save my life . So that 's gotta count for something , right ? Thank you , Peter . My son . Help you , gorgeous ? I hope so . I 'm looking for a typewriter . Well , you 're in luck . A Selectric . Model 251 . I see . It 's in the back . please let me out of here . I know you can hear me ! Please ... Please let me out of here . I know you can hear me ! Please let me out of here ! No , no , no . No ! No ! No !

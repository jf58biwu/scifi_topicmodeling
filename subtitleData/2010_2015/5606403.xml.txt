 Previously on Fringe ... Our Agent Dunham ... Did she meet Gunther ? She 's on the other side . Focused on the task at hand . How 'd you do it ? How 'd you replace our Olivia ? And whatever happens to me , I want you to know that this started out as an assignment , - but it became ... - Something more . She 's been infected with a deadly parasite . What do you see , Frank ? The picture on the sonogram ... - Uh-huh ? - You 're not infected . You 're pregnant . I heard the news . You 'll have whatever resources you need . After all , you are the mother of my future grandchild . You 're almost done . How long till we get the results ? I arranged to have the labs run in-house . We 'll know by the end of the day . Well , you know , if Rachel was a carrier , then ... Honey , you are a different person than your sister . Nothing is set in stone . Rosa , would you please talk to her ? Viral propagated eclampsia is dormant until pregnancy and undetectable before eight to ten weeks . So until we get the results of today 's screening , nothing is certain . You may not be a carrier at all . Okay . But it 's hard to believe that when the odds are 80 % that I am . On average . And , yes , the fact that Rachel had VPE puts you in the highest risk group . It 's okay to want to prepare yourself . Look ... I know it 's easier said than done , but my best advice to both of you is take it a step at a time . Let 's not get ahead of ourselves . - There 's still a chance ... - Mom , you weren 't listening , were you ? There is an eight out of ten chance that I 'm a carrier , and if I am , there 's only a handful of cases where either a mother or a baby survive delivery with VPE . So I don 't really have a choice . And let 's face it . I mean , I 'm alone . My job is all-consuming . My life is hardly conducive to parenting . Well , what about the father ? Oh , we 've been over this . You met a man in a bar while Frank was out of town ... Honey , that just doesn 't sound like you . Well , I never said that it was one of my finest moments . Well , I 'm sorry , but I don 't mean to be ... Judgmental ? Judgmental . I ... I just want you to have the support that you need . And I do . You and Lincoln should get together and commiserate . He 's not happy about this either . That doesn 't change the fact that you 'd make a wonderful mother someday . Mom ... Okay . Thanks for driving me . Are you sure you 're okay ? I can come upstairs with you if you like . No , I 'm good . All right , listen , call me as soon as you hear anything , good or bad . - I will . - I love you . Me too . Bye . Dunham . Hey , it 's me . Hey . You okay ? You sound distracted . No , I 'm good . You know , I 'm probably just being paranoid . I didn 't actually see anybody . But you said you saw someone yesterday . I ... I think so . I mean , I thought that I did . I 'm sending over a security detail . Lincoln , you really don 't have to do that . Well , I 'm your commanding officer , so your permission 's irrelevant . Besides , if you 're concerned you 're being followed , there 's probably a reason . They 'll be there within the hour . Okay . Thank you , Lincoln . Hang tight , Liv . You 're kidding me . You went on a date with bug girl ? Oh , you 're so smug . You know , at least I make attempts . You don 't even try to go out . That 's because my new position demands the majority of my time . Oh , your excuse is smug . Excuse me , Sir , the detail you requested has reached the location . Let me know as soon as they 're in place . Yes , Sir . Thank you , Agent . I already told you . I 'm not calling you sir . All right . Then tell me about bug girl . All right . First off , her name is Mona . Mona ? It was tea , and , uh , I 'm not going any further than that . Why not ? Buddy , why don 't you stop focusing on me and just admit ... You 've got a thing for Liv . That 's ridiculous . Although I do think if she was going to cheat on Frank with someone ... You know what ? It 's none of my business . Yeah . I knew that was driving you crazy . This is Agent Lee . What ? When ? Sir , I understand you have strong reservations . But from everything we know , Peter is uniquely suited to power the machine . And if we fail to determine a reliable way to cross between worlds ... I have already stated my opinion . We are not experimenting on children . I have made myself clear . Yes . Mr. Secretary , Manhattan Fringe Division , Agent Lee . Agent Lee , what is it ? Sir , Olivia 's been kidnapped . What do you mean , kidnapped ? Agent Dunham suspected she was being followed . Security detail found signs of a struggle and her door was wide open . Has anyone made contact with demands ? Not yet , but I spoke to her forty minutes ago , so it hasn 't been long . Have you contacted Echelon ? As soon as I heard . They 're activating the satellite . I don 't need to tell you , Agent Lee , how crucial it is that this matter be resolved safely . I want information as you receive it . Yes , Mr. Secretary . Echelon satellite tracking online . Give me some good news . - We got her , Sir . - Where ? North Moore Street moving east toward the harbor . Speed is fifty kilometers per hour . Let 's go ! Prepare to make the transfer . Let me know when you 're ready back there . She stopped moving . Corner at Mason and Tobey . Box positions . Front and back covered . On my signal . - Son of a bitch . - They knew she had a tracker . What 's next ? Phase one has disrupted the regulatory process . By now , all inhibitory proteins should be blocked . Doctor , she 's coming to . She 's a fighter ... Like they said . Let 's put her back out . This will help with the pain . Good . You should start feeling that right away . Let us know when she 's ready . What are you doing ? Just try to get some sleep . I 'll come back and check on you . So much for trackers being classified . I mean , that was a waste of valuable time . The trackers ... They 're organic technology . Okay ... Which means what ? They 're distinct in every person . And untraceable without the Echelon protocol . So there 's only one way that the kidnappers would know about the trackers . Either this is an inside job or someone sold the information . Excuse me , Agent Lee , I was told that you wanted to see me right way . Yes . I need you to construct a database . I want the names and background of everyone that has clearance high enough to know about our tracking protocol . Yes , Sir . In the meantime , I think that you will want to look at this . I 've reviewed the traffic for a three-block radius around Agent Dunham 's residence . There 's an anomaly ... The same commercial vehicle has cruised past her building six times in the past week . The chances of that are 1 in 756,000 . It is a clear statistical outlier . You said a commercial vehicle ? It 's registered to a livery service . Yo , he 's crazy . Fringe Division ! Hands on the wheel ! Get out of the car ! Which one is it ? Out of the car ! - Okay , okay . - Turn around ! - Where 's the show me ? - It 's in the front seat . - Where 's Agent Dunham ? - What ? You 've been driving by her building ... Why ? I 'm a cab driver . I got fares all over . All right . I was worried about her . That 's all ! Once in a while I drive by , make sure she 's okay . - That 's not a crime . - All right . Henry Arliss Higgins . He lives on Hastings Avenue . Wife 's Jasmine . Daughter 's Laura . How do you know her ? Don 't you push me , Henry . Agent Dunham happens to be a very good friend of mine . Sure don 't seem that way . Not from what she 's told me . - You know Dunham . - Yeah , I do . I know you too . This is the second time you 've pointed a gun at me . The first was the day I met her . You 're the cab driver from the gas station . You helped her get away . Well , she ... She threatened me . - Where is she ? - How would I know ? I didn 't expect she would come back here . What do you mean , back here ? Don 't move , please . Up her to fifty milligrams . That should keep her knocked out . Fifty milligrams ? Is there a problem ? No , Doctor . Good . How 's he doing ? He 's doing very well . Abdominal circumference 160 , head 170 , bi-parietal diameter 40 . Shouldn 't be long now . I 'll make sure everything 's ready . I 'll administer the sedatives . It 's time for your pill . - No , I ... - It 's for your own good . There 's no time for discussion . Now , do I need to call the orderlies or not ? Good girl . Now , just ... relax . All I know is she was scared . She kept on saying people were trying to convince her - that she was someone that she wasn 't . - What people ? People she was running away from . You guys , I guess . So she said she wanted to go home . Yeah . To some guy . Named Peter . Peter ? That was his name . Look , I didn 't want to get involved in any of this . But she ... She got to me . And you said after you helped her get to Liberty Island , you didn 't see her again ? I didn 't expect to . Till I ran into her a few weeks ago on the street . Only she acted like she didn 't know me . Like her mind got wiped . When someone knows you and then all of a sudden they don 't ... I don 't know . I ... I got worried . Look , I 'm not trying to ruffle any feathers here , guys . There 's some things a guy like me shouldn 't know about . I get it . But you start hearing things about some other universe ... - It 's hard to ignore . - What did you just say ? What about my taxi ? Okay , this is ... seriously messed up . He knows way too many details to be lying . What are you thinkin ' ? Remember after Liv 's breakdown - when she came back to field duty ? - Yeah . You asked me if I thought it was possible for our Olivia to be switched with the one from the other universe . - And you said I was crazy . - What if you 're not ? Hello ? Marilyn ? It 's Rosa . I 've left several messages for Olivia , but I couldn 't reach her . Oh , well ... I 'm sure something must have come up at work . Do you have her test results back ? Yes . I 'm sorry . Olivia is a carrier for VPE . Listen , I 'd like Olivia to meet with a trauma counselor here on staff , Beau Amaral . He 's wonderful . He can talk to her . I 'm sure that 'll be helpful . Marilyn ? I 'm here . Tell Olivia to call me when you talk to her . I 'd like to schedule the procedure as soon as possible before there 's any risk to her health . Okay , I 'll tell her just as soon as she calls back . Thank you , Rosa . Bye . Doctor , we 're ready . What ... What ... What are you doing to me ? And this all from a cab driver . Yes . With all due respect , Sir ... If there 's any truth to what he 's saying , it could be a lead . I need to know . Was our Agent Dunham replaced with theirs ? She was . Yes . And during that time , our Agent Dunham infiltrated their Fringe Division . I wish I was told sooner . You weren 't told because it was classified . Our Agent Dunham returned safely to our side weeks ago . And theirs ? Was sent home . I 'm beginning to think that ... Not sharing this information may hinder your ability to find Olivia . What are you thinking ? That this all may have something to do with her abduction ? Agent Dunham is carrying my grandchild . It wasn 't part of the mission . When she was on the other side , Olivia and my son got close . I believed the child and Olivia would be safer if no one knew the truth . Who else knows about this ? As far as I know , just Olivia and I. Do you think she could have been taken by invaders from the other side ? I imagine it 's possible . Or , if as you suggest ... That this could be an inside job . None of us is without enemies . You 're suggesting this may be about you ? My son was taken from me , Agent Lee . The notion that I might lose my future grandchild is simply impossible . I will answer your questions . I will give you complete access to Olivia 's mission files . Whatever it takes ... Find her . I 'll do my best , Sir . How are her ligaments doing ? Supple . The chemicals are working . Okay . Calibrate the joint expander to 18 degrees . If her bone can withstand it , increase to 23 . Hemoglobin count 6.7 . That 's low . I agree . It 's borderline . Utero-placental blood flow is inadequate . Is her pain management on schedule ? Yes , Doctor . I gave her the last sedative twenty minutes ago . Administer another twelve units of plasma immediately . - This will be her fifth transfusion . - Duly noted . Acceleration at this rate is difficult in the best of circumstances . With her erratic vitals ... We will take appropriate precautions . I 'm not sure they exist . If her body isn 't ready ... We have the timetable . There will be no adjustments . Initiate phase two . Have you emptied your bladder ? Yeah , I feel really kinda dizzy . Did you empty your bladder ? You 're an obstetric nurse . You must feel some kind of calling to do something so selfless . You know , to help women bring babies into the world . I think I may have VPE . In fact , I probably do . My sister and her baby didn 't make it through labor . Both their hearts gave out . You cannot be okay with what they 're doing to me . If you don 't make them stop , then they 're gonna kill me and they 're gonna kill the child that I 'm carrying . You don 't have to do ... anything . You just have to leave me alone just for a minute . Please . Okay ? We 're starting the next phase in 22 minutes . And believe me , you don 't wanna be standing when it happens , so stop wasting time . Empty your bladder and let 's get on with this . Whoever kidnapped Olivia knew she was implanted with a subcutaneous tracker . All employees with level five clearance had access to the biometric tracking protocol . I complied the database , but without another variable , the list is fairly extensive . We have another one . What we 're about to tell you requires level ten clearance . Sir , I 'm nowhere near that level . Concerning this matter , you are now . What is it ? Agent Dunham is pregnant with Secretary Bishop 's grandchild . Oh , I see . I 'll start by cross-referencing agents with clearance with those who also had access to Agent Dunham 's medical records . Let me know as soon as you 're done . Marilyn 's here . Did you call her ? I thought it was time she knew . I sure don 't want to do this . All right , listen , I 'll talk to her . You deal with Travis Bickle . Come on . Coppola ... " You talkin ' to me ? " No idea . All right . Point is , Henry 's probably done with his statement . I 'll deal with Marilyn . - Thank you , Charlie . - Yeah , buddy . We 're working every lead . Every agent in this office , they 're doing everything they can to find her . How long has she been missing ? Hmm ? I knew that something was wrong because ... Dr. Oporto said she wasn 't answering her phone calls . Who 's Dr. Oporto ? It 's her obstetrician . There 's a possibility that ... Her kidnapping - relates to her pregnancy . - She can 't have the baby . There 's ... There 's no way she can have the baby . You need help with your slippers ? No . You 're gonna get me out of here . You 're making a big mistake . Help ! In here ! You can 't leave ! Either I leave or you bleed to death . Where is she ? Don 't worry . She won 't get far . Hey ! Hey . Please , can you let me in ? Hey ! Help me ! Oh ! Impound brought your cab around . It should be waiting for you on B-4 . Valet service , huh ? Look , I know you still have questions , but I can 't impress this on you enough ... What we 've talked about is restricted information . Ah , don 't worry . I 'm not talking . Not that anyone would believe me anyhow . This is Agent Lee . - Lincoln ! - Oh , my God , Olivia . Where are you ? I 'm in Chinatown . I 'm not exactly sure where . Listen carefully . I want you to look around and tell me what you see . Okay . I see a ... A dragon . It 's red . And there 's a noodle store . Listen , Lincoln , I need a doctor . I think ... I think that the baby 's coming . What ? They accelerated the pregnancy . All right . You 're gonna be okay . I need you to speak to my mo ... ther ! Liv , what 's happening ? Olivia , can you hear me ? I need a trace on that call that originated in Chinatown ! - I know a shortcut . - Yeah ? I 'm a cabbie . I know every shortcut . What 's wrong with you ? Oh , God , I need help ! Oh ! She called from a phone booth . Canal and Market . Did you get that ? - Canal and Market . Got it . - Yeah . We 're close . - What about the medical team ? - They 're en route . Tell them she 's in labor . That 's impossible . No . They accelerated her pregnancy . Lincoln . Listen to me . I spoke to Marilyn . There 's something wrong . She won 't make it through delivery . Fringe Division ! - Out of the way ! - You heard him ! Please ! Oh ! Oh , Lincoln , I think the baby 's coming . Let 's get her inside . Right here , right here . Olivia ... My name is Henry . I delivered my little girl in the back of my cab . It 's not exactly a medical degree , but I can help out until the ambulance arrives . - You can trust him . - Okay . - It 's nice to meet you , Henry . - Yeah . You too . - May I ? - Sure . Now , get your knees up . Okay ? Easy . Okay ? Nice and easy . Lincoln , did you talk to my mom ? Oh , God . Just squeeze my hand . As hard as you need to . You 're feeling it like you need to bear down . - Mm-hmm . - That 's okay . This baby on its way . You just look at me . You don 't think about an hour from now . You don 't think about a minute . We 're gonna focus on this moment , okay ? - It 's you and me . - God , I 'm scared . Put your chin to your chest . It 'll help . Okay , and I need you to push . One , two ... Three . Keep pushing , keep pushing . Four , five . That 's good , that 's good . That 's really good . You promise me that you will stay until this is over . - There 's no place else for me to be . - That 's it . You 're doing so good . Okay , you 're almost there . Come on , push . One , two ... I love you . Promise me you 'll save the baby . Liv ... Promise . Okay . I promise . Oh , my God , I see his head ! All right , you gotta go . Keep going . Keep going . Keep going ! There it is ! There it is ! He 's here . He 's okay . He 's okay . You hear that ? Liv ? He made it . Oh ... He 's fine ! You ... You have a son . He 's beautiful . I wonder what she 's gonna end up naming him . - She didn 't tell you ? - No . I 'll give you a hint . It 's not Lincoln . You don 't know anything , do you ? No , I don 't . But I had you going . Can 't believe Liv 's alone . Listen , you did a good job , Sir . Broyles would be proud . Hold on . Did you just say sir ? Don 't get used to it . Any news ? We found the location where they were holding her . Abandoned building on Bayard Street . - Techs are there now . - Have they found anything ? No , Sir , not yet . I want security assigned at all times . Until we find whoever did this , Agent Dunham and her baby are still at risk . I 've arranged for Secret Service . There 's an agent outside her room right now . Thank you , Agent Lee . Your hard work will not go unrewarded . I 'll go up and ... meet my grandson . Yes , Sir . He should have told us . Which part ? He 's a miracle . They said it was the acceleration . That the ... The virus couldn 't replicate as fast as the pregnancy . Whatever the science is ... He 's still a miracle . They put an imposter on our team to protect their mission . And do the math . Olivia , when she came back ... Wasn 't it around the time Broyles disappeared ? It was . Makes you wonder what else we don 't know . Yes , it does . As soon as I found out I was pregnant , all I did was think about whether or not I had the condition . I never actually spent any time thinking about ... Being a mom . I mean , I ... Now I just ... I don 't know if I 'm ready . To tell you the truth , all you need to do is love him . And you can figure out the rest as you go on . I 'm gonna need your help . I hope so . Sorry to interrupt . - How are you feeling ? - Good . I 'll be right back . - Do you mind if I tag along ? - Not at all . You 're a handsome little fellow , aren 't you ? Oh , sweetie ! Ooh ! That goes to the lab . What a good boy . It 's okay . It 's okay , sweetie . - There 's your grandson back . - Oh ! Yes ! You are so brave . Yes ! It is happening . Why did you tell Lincoln so much ? He 's a good agent . And smart . The lie would have made him grow suspicious . And I trusted that you wouldn 't fail . We didn 't .

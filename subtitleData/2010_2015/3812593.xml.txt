( Junior Oficer ) Uh , I think ... We Just lost camera seven . ( Terry ) Do you Know where I was Stationed before this ? ( Junior Oficer ) Afghanistan . ( Terry ) That 's Right , Afghanistan . Million-Dollar Surveillance Equipment Sent to the hills of Tora Bora , thousands of miles Away from civilization . Anything I wanted was A phone call away . So could somebody please Tell to me how I can be in The most Technologically advanced Country in the World , and not get one Decent surveillance camera ? ( Junior Oficer ) I don 't ... ( Chizuru ) Iori ... I 'm so glad you could Finally make it . ( Iori ) I am so Sorry we 're late . Chizuru , this Is Mai Shiranui . ( Mai ) It 's so wonderful To finally meet you . Oh , I understand Congratulations Are in order . Well , thank You very much . You 've come a Long way this past year . I can 't remember When we 've had a Fighter quite so driven . Well , now that you 're Here , I guess we can begin . Truth be told , I 'm a little nervous . ( Iori ) What 's going on ? Well , these Artifacts have never been Displayed like this . Well then , Why risk it ? If anything Should happen ... Takao Iwata insisted . He 's in financial control Of the tournament , and It 's no secret he Likes to show off . I just have to make sure The security we 've put in Place is adequate . ( Terry ) Does she know About our cameras ? ( Junior Oficer ) I , uh , Don 't think so , ( Iori ) Thank you . ( Mai ) WOW ... Look at you . The way they treat you , You 'd think You were the king of fighters . I 've been Retired way too long . No , I 've been invited Because I 'm the last of The Yagami clan . You never told me Why you retired so early . It 's complicated . Well , you 're a Complicated guy , Iori . I wouldn 't expect It to be simple . Another time . Promise ? I Will . Hey , that 's Not a promise . I will . Come on . ( Chizuru ) I 'm sorry To keep you waiting , Mr. Iwata . Please , follow me . ( Iori ) Come with me . Come on . Best seats in the house . ( Iori ) There they are , The treasures of the clans . These make the king Of fighters tournament possible . ( Iori ) You need To take that ? No , I don 't . You have my full attention Tonight , I 'm sorry . Sit down . Well , the secret ... Of the treasures Are meant to be Kept within the clans . ( Mai ) Oh . But I can Tell you a little . Okay . The Yasakani no Magatama was created By my ancestors . Almost 2,000 years ago . At that time , the Necklace possessed ... The energy to unlock The door . It 's the key . The yata mirror Is the door ... And it was the yata clan Who first created the mirror . Chizuru is the last Descendant of that clan . And do you remember What happens uh , when you Direct the energy of The necklace into the shield ? You unlock the passageway To the other dimension Exactly . But I still don 't Understand . I mean ... You have a Necklace and a mirror ... It 's not logical . How ? Oh , miss logical , I forgot . Iori , we 're using earpieces . I mean , how does That even happen ? Look , I know it Doesn 't look like much , But that 's the point . Chizuru 's father was a Genius , and he was able to Consolidate the existing Energy waves from these Artifacts and Condense them into The earpieces we 're using today . Now , at the push of a Button , we 're able to ... Enter another dimension . Wow . I know , it 's crazy . Well , what About that third one ? It 's the kusanagi sword ... The most important Of the treasures . Only the sword ... Can defeat the Orochi . What is that ? ( Iori ) The Orochi is a Spirit , or a demon , That was banished to the Dimension 1800 years ago . Legend has it promising Unlimited power to Anyone that frees it , but he Would have to possess All three treasures to do so . ( Mai ) what would happen If he was freed ? That 's a lesson for another Day , when you 're ready Hopefully soon . ( Guard ) I 'm looking to do more I think I need to ( Terry ) Go ! Go , go , go , go ! Let 's get a Closer look , okay ? What ? Who Is That ? Come On . ( Rugal ) Chizuru ... How are you , Rugal ? ( Guard ) Excuse me . ( Rugal ) Peek-a-boo . ( Terry ) Go ! ( Iori ) Chizuru ... ( Iori ) She 's hurt bad .

( Iori ) The relics are ... ( Iori ) Call for help . ( Mai ) We need An ambulance ! ( Mai ) Call 911 ! ( Rugal ) Iori ! ( Rugal ) Come with me . Remember what waits for Us on the other side . I can 't , and i Can 't let you either . Okay . More for me then . ( Rugal ) Wouldn 't it be Ironic if i was to kill You now with this sword ? ( Terry ) Come out With your hands up !

( Iori ) He didn 't Take the sword . ( Chizuru ) The Sword is a fake . ( Mai ) What ? Rugal 's Going back in . People will die if you Don 't find the real one . Chizuru , It 's just a game . Not if someone Submits to the orochi . It 'll ... It 'll Turn into a death match . Find Saisyu kusanagi . When you do , you 'll Find the real sword . ( Chizuru ) Without the true Kusanagi sword , Rugal cannot Free the Orochi , and if He did , he would be unstoppable . ( Mai ) I 'll tell Iori . ( Chizuru ) No , you can 't . It 's too dangerous . Iori should stay out of this . You must go alone . Me ? Chizuru , i don 't ... I know who you are . Iori Can 't be involved . You have to trust me . Please . Excuse me . Hi . I understand you have a Patient here , Named saisyu kusanagi . I 'd like to speak to him . ( Berta ) You want to Talk to Saisyu Kusanagi ? That 's right . Okay . ( Berta ) Mr. Kusanagi ... Hasn 't responded to anyone For almost 10 years . He eats , he walks , he sleeps , But the last thing He 'll do is talk . He lives in his Own lonely world . Have a nice talk . ( Mai ) Thank you . MR. Kusanagi ? ( Mai ) Mr. Kusanagi ? ( sighs ) God ... What now ? ( Kyo ) May I help you ? I 'm Mai ... Shiranui . I came here looking For mr . Kusanagi , but i Wasn 't aware of His condition .

That 's classified . And who failed To stop Rugal ? Actually , we stopped Him from stealing Your Kusanagi sword , Thank you very much . It 's too bad the sword Was a fake . Nice try . Look , this guy 's a Murderer , he 's on the loose . I just want to Know where he is . It 's complicated . Let me guess , He 's hiding in your Secret little tournament . See , that 's right . I know all about it . Is that so ? Then Why do you need me ? Cause I don 't know where it is . So , where is it ? The tournament takes Place in another dimension . Don 't give me that Bullshit about dimensions . Well ... Actually , string Theory supports the Idea of over 10 Or 11 different ... Dimensions , Occupying the same ... Time capsule as this one . You got beat up a lot As a kid , didn 't you ? NO . Mr. Bogard ... I could tell you everything You want to know ... But it doesn 't mean You 'll believe me . At this point , you Know what ? Try me . Rugal 's hiding in the Tournament dimension . He 's been consumed by the Orochi , and he 's trying To lure fighters in There to kill them . Okay ... Why is that ? So he can be King of fighters . Other dimension , king Of tooth fairies . Look , i 'm trained to Believe in the tangible , Not the bullshit story You 're telling me . People are dying ... And you want me to believe You and your crazy stories ? No . But you 'll believe Mai . Who 's Mai ? The undercover operative You assigned to infiltrate Our organization A year ago . Oh , that Mai . She 's in Seattle . If you don 't believe Me , go talk to her . She 'll confirm everything I 'm telling you . You know we 're Wasting our time here . Chizuru sent Me here for a reason . Yeah , To find Saisyu . He 's dead , it 's Time to move on now . What about Kyo ? Kyo is a half-breed . He 's not a true Kusanagi . Iori , what Is the Orochi ? Really ? What is it ? You wouldn 't Understand . It 's pure evil . Iori , you have to Learn how to trust me . Tell me more . It can give you Great strength and power That 's addictive And destructive . Eventually , it consumes You , and you can 't shake it . Is that why you left ? Where did he go ? ( Kyo ) What did you Do to my father ? ( Mai ) Kyo , he Didn 't do anything . My father was completely Unresponsive for 10 years , And you walk in , he wakes Up and tries to kill you . Why ? It 's about our families . He was a Kusanagi ... And you 're a Yagami . Then you understand . We 're destined to be enemies . What was that about ? He can 't help us , Mai . And you won 't . I Don 't know what 's worse . Mai ... Look , just let Me talk to him . He has to know Something . I have to try . ( Mai ) You got room for one more ? I don 't think I 'm going your way . If you 're looking For answers , I 'll tell you Everything I know , and Then I 'll leave it up to You to make the next move . Fair ? ( Kyo ) What , did you break it ? ( Mick O 'Merai ) I Didn 't break it . ( Kyo ) Well then , What 's wrong with it ? ( Mick ) It 's Broke , but I didn 't do it . ( Mick ) Whoa . Wow .

Do you know what Happened to him ? Yeah , the tournaments , That 's what happened to him . How much do you know About the tournaments ? You fight , too , don 't you ? I asked you a question . Are You going to answer me ... ( Mai ) Oh ! Shit . Kyo , I 'm sorry ! ( Kyo ) Oh , it 's ... It 's okay . I 'm fine . ( Kyo ) I think It 's dislocated . ( Mai ) Kyo , I 'm sorry .

You still haven 't told me what It is you 're you 're doing here . I 'm looking for a sword . What sword ? Well , it 's yours , But it seems you don 't Know much ... About Your family history . The Kusanagi clan history ? It 's just a bunch of legends And fairy tales to Entertain children . What about what Iori said ? That you and he were Destined to be enemies . Your boyfriend didn 't tell you ? He 's not ... All right . The way the story goes , As far as I know it , Is that it was one Of his ancestors From the Yagami clan who first Tried to release the Orochi . He wanted to be the king of Fighters and harness its power . Instead , it consumed him With a murderous rage . So the clans united , and One of my ancestors killed Him and returned the Orochi back to its world . So they say . Well , it 's happening again . That 's why I 'm here . You really Believe that stuff ? Listen , Kyo , someone is trying To harness the Orochi power , And if Rugal succeeds , we may Never be able to stop him . What is it ? Do you know where I Can find Rugal ? ( Mai ) Why ? Because he 's the one who Destroyed my father 's mind ( Mai ) Are you sure ? ( Kyo ) I 'm sure , and I 'm going to Make him pay for what he did . ( Iori ) Did you get what You needed ? Let 's go ... ( Mai ) Iori ... we need Your help , okay ? I don 't know enough . You have to talk to him . Please . ( Kyo ) What can you Tell me about Rugal ? Where 's the sword ? ( Kyo ) I don 't know . Let 's go . ( Mai ) Iori ... ( Terry ) Hey , buddy . Well , it looks like we Have a little party here . How come I wasn 't invited ? We were on our way out . Whoa , whoa , Whoa , where you going ? You going to introduce Me to your friends ? I think they also might Want to know that Rugal is Killing people in The tournament . A string of bodies ... All members of this tournament . Now , I know this guy Rugal 's involved . Wait , Rugal ? That 's the guy who Tried to kill my father . Well , we Have to stop him . I need your help . From what I 've been Told , the only way is to Find the sword . ( Terry ) The sword ... ( Kyo ) A sword ? Really ? Wow , that 's just fantastic . It 's the Kusanagi sword . All right , it 's a myth , okay ? You ... You supposedly Combine it with ... You 're a disgrace To the Kusanagi family . Excuse me ? Everything 's A joke to you . Who the hell Do you think you are ? You don 't know Anything about me . What ... What is this ? Huh ? You promised me some answers , And I got to deal with guy ? Look , let 's ... Let 's Make this simple . Just tell me where I can find Rugal . It 's not simple . He 's In another dimension . Oh ! Here we go with the Dimensions bullshit . Dimension . There 's only one dimension . Dimensions , dimension . Nobody travels to Another dimension And fights in Underground tournaments . It doesn 't happen . Thank you . I have . Oh , of course you have . Have you lost your Frigging mind ? Y-you actually Believe you 've gone to Another dimension ? That 's it . That 's it . Terry ... No , I 'm taking You off the case . ( Iori ) Wait a minute , What ? What did you say ? He 's taking You off this case ? Wow , this just keeps Getting better and better . Tell me something , Mai , is There anyone in this room That you haven 't Lied to yet ? ( Mai ) Iori ...

( Iori ) Rugal , I got to say , I love what you 've Done with the place . ( Rugal ) Aw ... Cute . Look , girls . Iori 's come to play . Disappointed , Rugal ? Actually , I can 't Think of anyone else Who 'd appreciate what I 'm doing more than you . Well , I came to stop you . I don 't think so . You ... Come on , let 's be Honest , you have issues . I got issues . Wow . Well , I got my issues under Control , but , uh , you , um ... Enough . Well , you just Going to stand there And keep talking , or are you Going to come down and fight ? Who said anything About me fighting ? And it begins . Come on . Where 's the old Iori I know and love ? Aaaagh ! There he is . Bravo ! That 's the spirit . Accept it . You know its power , What it feels like . Do it ... Do it ! Together , We can be invincible . No one will stop us ! ( Mai ) Iori ? Iori ? ( Mai ) Iori ? Iori ... Your eyes ... Stay away from me ! Find the sword . Man , this is crazy . You locate Rugal , you Know where to find me . ( Terry ) Mai , really , Don 't beat yourself up . ( Mai ) No , I 'm not . You should , though . Really ? Yeah . Hey , I 'm not the One pitting two of our Suspects together in a Vicious love triangle that Threatens to unleash an Evil force into our world , Potentially unraveling the Fabric of our universe . I mean , I don 't Know , if I was you , and That were true , I might Feel a little guilty . I should have Told him sooner . He 'll never Forgive me now . Yes , he will . Thanks . Which one Are we talking about ? You 're such a jerk . You were doing What you were supposed to do . You were doing your job . Yeah , some job , Making people hate me . Nah , that 's Not why they hate you . Probably hates you Because you went Awol , and you didn 't Disclose your involvement In a secret , Inter-dimensional , Underground Fighting tournament . No , wait a minute , That 's why I hate you ! I hate you . Sorry , but no joking , You 're going to Have to take the lead On this , because , quite Frankly , I don 't Have a lead . Yeah . Listen , I think we Should start with Kyo . We 'll go to see him tomorrow . We need to have Him on board . I 'll deal with Iori later . Why does this place smell ? We 're on a budget . It 's an old abandoned Fish cannery . ( Mai ) It 's a field Office in a fish cannery ? ( Terry ) Hey , nothing But the best for the CIA You have no idea What it means to be a Kusanagi . Now , why Do you say that ? You have Kusanagi Blood running through you . It 's your responsibility , Your destiny to be ... To Face the Orochi , but you Don 't want to accept it . You 're afraid . No , I just don 't Believe in your stories . Take it for a spin . You 're not Mai . I must have The wrong number . This is the Tournament , isn 't it ? You 're new at this . This is what We do here , right ? We fight ? That 's not fighting . Technically , that 's You taking a beating . Tell you what I 'm going to do , I 'm going to let you live . Go and tell your Friends ... That I promise To stop all the murder . Just get back Here and fight . Let 's have some fun . ( Mai ) Iori ! You could have killed him . I just Don 't understand . What am I Supposed to do ? These people ... They think I 'm Something I 'm not . That 's it , huh ? It 's best to be like Water , which benefits the 10,000 things . That 's what I 'll do . How did You find me here ? Well , I knew you 'd Be looking for answers . Are you okay ? I just don 't understand What he saw in that place . My father was a man of peace . All I saw was evil . It wasn 't Always that way . What do you see in there ? I don 't know , a Place where I can be me . Can 't you be yourself here ? Can you ? You know , one lost soul Can recognize another I thought you were Just after the sword . I 'm looking For a lot of things . What do You want from me ? I need your help . Why ? Because my last Name is Kusanagi ? No , because you Are the last Kusanagi . I 'm not who You want me to be . My father was the Last of the clan , and And Rugal destroyed all that . The Kusanagi Clan is over . I don 't know that your father Would agree with that . He gave you the name . What makes you think That I can succeed Where Saisyu failed ? I repair motorcycles , I 'm not a hero . Kyo , I don 't Know what you are . You don 't even Know what you are . That 's something you 'll Have to discover , But right now , we Have to stop Rugal , And we 're going to do It with or without you . You did what ? Look , I don 't know what 's Going on with these things After I saw what it did to The Kusanagi kid , I had to do something . ( Mai ) So you used Chizuru 's list to steal Them from the fighters ? Come on , we 're CIA , it 's Called " Confiscate . " Confiscate ? I trusted you with that . She trusted me . While you 're out There getting romantic with These guys , I 'm here trying to Investigate this thing . So if there is some other Dimension , like you say , Maybe I just stopped The only way in , right ? ( Chizuru ) No , You haven 't . Chizuru ... Thank you for coming . What is She doing here ? She trusts me . ( Chizuru ) We 've No time to lose . Rugal is becoming more And more powerful , And I 'm afraid your plan to Stop him won 't work . Ah , that 's because there 's no Other dimension , right ? No , it 's Because Rugal is close To merging our two worlds . What do you mean ? Well ... Well , actually , It 's kind of cool ... Ah , here we go again . No , you see ... These dimensions ... Dimensions , see ? I told you There was more than one . ( Scott ) These dimensions Exist in what could more Accurately be described As a multi verse ... Or parallel universe . You see , Rugal was Able to get access to An exact replica of Our plane of existence . This means he can use A portal to force Fighters into The tournament . ( Rugal ) Hey ... We have an appointment . ( Scott ) She 's in there . This is all happening In real-time . This is amazing . You had the sword This whole time ? Iori , not now . Look ... You Barge into my life And demand the only connection I had to my father . Did you really expect Me just to hand it over ? It 's here now , and I 'm ready to go in . Kyo , I 'm sorry For what happened to your Father , but you must be Careful not to let your Anger get the best of you . I know . Just , Believe in yourself . I will . I 'm sorry , Iori , it 's too dangerous . You need me . Fighting Rugal Will be hard enough . If ... If you succumb To the Orochi ... Which is not going To happen this time . I 'm strong enough . Then use your strength To do the right thing . Please . I 'm going in there . You don 't even Believe in orders . Well , it 's About time I start . Show us how These things work , Scotty . Iori , if we don 't come Back ... Destroy everything . ( Mai ) Terry ! What are you doing here ? I 'm your partner . What do you think , I 'm Just going to leave you ? ( Rugal ) Welcome To my humble ... Abode . Chizuru ? Good to see you . For a while there , I Thought you wouldn 't make it . All this because You want to be king of fighters ? I am king of fighters . Then why don 't You stop all of this and Come back to The real world ? This world is all I need . Here , I 'm immortal . This isn 't life . This is where we come to Challenge ourselves And learn , so we can be better In the real world . When my world expands And merges with Yours , this will Be the real world . I 'll be King of everything . I 'm invincible . You 're not invincible ... Not as long as we Have the sword . The Kusanagi sword ? Saisyu was my father . Kusanagi ... Well , well . This is just beautiful . It 's over , Rugal . Oh , no . No . The fun has just begun . ( Chizuru ) Kyo ! You can do this . ( Scott ) They got separated . Kyo 's fighting Rugal alone .

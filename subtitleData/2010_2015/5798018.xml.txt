 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on extant : John : Ethan suddenly speaks japanese . ( speaks japanese ) wow . Human beings can 't learn a language In a single day , so ethan Shouldn 't be able to , either . I think we should install Some sort of governing mechanism . But that goes against everything you 've ever said . You 're good . I 'm odin . You want to come in ? Next time . Odin : We have lost Our souls to machines . We need a reckoning . Starting right here . ( groans ) Sparks : With your prints , He stole the aruna transmission file . Dad , I 'm gonna die up here . Molly : What kind of father Sends his daughter into harm 's way like that , alan ? Katie : Dad ? Katie . What do you want ? I want to know where my baby is . I 'll find it . Guard : Security breach . Code black . Molly woods is in the building . Have security forces been mobilized ? Yes . ( shouts , grunts ) ( shouts ) shh ! It 's me . You can go with them Or you can come with me . Your choice . Kryger ? Go , go , go . ( tires screeching ) Gina , oasis mode . Windows on seclude . How do you know they didn 't follow us here ? Because I 'd know if we were seen , and it 's My job to activate a team to follow you . No , we got away clean . We 're safe here . You can trust me . You want me to trust you ? Tell me everything . The truth . From your party , you were right to run to vaspar . He was bringing you in to extract the offspring . The offspring ? That 's what we call it . When you fled , we had to improvise . Sparks may seem like the man in charge , But I think there 's somebody else Who 's pulling the strings , Somebody outside the isea . Who ? I don 't know . But whoever he is , he outfitted the hospital ship With a surgical team . They erased all the evidence Of your pregnancy , and then They put you back on the island . And ethan ? He was used to lure you into the woods . And the baby ? It 's alive ? It 's a he . ( exhales ) ¶ I don 't trust nobody ¶ I don 't love nobody ¶ I don 't trust nobody ¶ I won 't kill nobody ¶ for anyone but you ... ( knocking ) ( music stops ) You 're lucky , odin . I don 't usually let in handsome foreigners Until after 2 : 00 . John ? Why did you do it ? Do what ? Reset ethan 's access protocols . What are you talking about ? You 've been against The idea of installing governors I-in ethan Since I brought it up . Now all of a sudden I can 't get in ? Wait . So , you actually tried to slow him down And he blocked your access ? No , no , no , no . You blocked my access . Okay , I may not agree with Intentionally limiting his natural development , But I would not go behind your back to stop you . Wow . I guess you thought I would . But h-how would he even do it ? I mean , we-we built in safeguards To prevent him from interfering with the coding process . I don 't know . Why would the most advanced ai on the planet Stop you from hobbling his mind ? I didn 't mean to ... Are you alone ? What if I 'm not ? I should go . Yeah . Kern : He 's in an artificial womb About 20 floors below where you were poking around . It 's not gonna be a baby for long . It 's growing fast . They 're treating an alien intelligence far beyond Our comprehension like a lab rat . Molly , I know what you 're thinking . You are not its mother ; you were its host . He sent me a message tonight . He scattered a flock of birds in-in the shape of the pattern . It 's trying to speak to us . And it wants to communicate through you . Kryger : I 'm sorry . It made me flush my mother into space . It ain 't the baby jesus . Whatever he is , I brought him here . And I 'm gonna get him out . Kern : You think you 're getting back Into that building after what happened today ? It 's impossible . If sparks is running a rogue operation , Just go to the isea and tell them . Tell them what ? Without proof of the baby , we got nothing . We have the aruna file . They killed derek pearce because I sent him an e-mail . What do you think will happen if I go in there with just My story and the aruna file ? What choice do we have , huh ? Sparks reports to the board . You walk into the morning meeting , you play them the file . They can 't all be in on it . And what if Sparks buries the truth of the baby before they see it ? They 're never gonna know what he did . But it 'll be over . And we 'll be safe . Hey , hold up . You don 't believe this , do you ? That this-this thing is trying to communicate with molly ? It chose her for a reason . But the way it 's being treated , That may change everything . I was an air force mp All the way through second korea . I was stationed in all kinds of hellholes Across this rock , and there is one thing That has never changed : If you lock someone in a box Who doesn 't belong there , He 's got a lot to say when you finally let him out . Sparks is going about this the wrong way . He 's gonna get a lot of people hurt . You don 't have to convince me . I almost got my ticket punched . I never intended on killing you . Well , you could 've fooled me . No one 's stopping you from walking . And leave you alone with molly ? Hell no . Right now she is the only friend I have on this planet . And this whole switching sides thing seems rather convenient . Maybe I stick around to make sure you don 't pull another 180 . Your call . But you can trust me . No offense , but the only person I trust is me at this point . ( whirring ) Claypool has been compromised . Molly woods breached the upper floor And managed to escape . How is this possible ? I don 't know . But with her getting this close , I believe the entire operation is at risk . I also believe That it 's time to eliminate that risk . For so long , You 've wanted to protect her , And now ... Molly 's a very smart woman . She 's a viable threat to the offspring . But she is its mother . There could be consequences if we eliminate her . We must ensure its continued growth . Even at the risk of being discovered ? It 's a risk we must manage . I 'm dying , alan . The substance that sustains me Has nearly been exhausted . Despite my best efforts , I have failed to reproduce it . We could do another mission . We could learn from the mistakes We made with the aruna . Why send another mining expedition when we have In our possession perhaps something more valuable ? Billions were spent locating the source of the substance , And we encounter the entity in the same location ? It can 't be coincidence . It 's all the more reason to protect it . Yes , there are many reasons . You yourself have one . Sir ? I 've seen the surveillance footage . At first , it was difficult to understand What was happening . But it became clear You were able to see katie . That she had come back to life for you . What a wonderful gift you 've been given . What is it like ? A miracle . I can only imagine . I need the offspring To stay alive . You need it to have a reason to live . What would you like for me to do , sir ? Relocate the offspring To the contingency site immediately . But molly woods is not to be harmed . When we know the offspring has no use for its mother , You can do what you wish . Place call . ( soft chime ) Anya sparks . Alan ? Alan , what 's wrong ? Nothing . I just needed to talk . Oh , you know , it 's-it 's late . It 's just I was thinking of katie . You 're the only one in the world who understands . I understand that Calling me makes you feel better . I do . But it just makes me feel worse . If katie was ... We 'd still be together . A family . But she 's not . That 's not gonna change . Good night , alan . ¶ You sure you don 't want me to come with you To the board meeting ? Nope . I 've worked for the isea for almost 20 years now , and ... You know , what we have should be enough . I 'm sorry , molly . It wasn 't just the baby they took from you . They took everything . Space . The stars . Not everything . ( quiet laugh ) Yes . We still have breakfast . I got your message about ethan 's governors . I think you 're making a mistake . Well , it 's a moot point . He locked me out . I don 't understand . Well , that makes two of us . I 've lost all access to ethan 's neuralnet . How is that even possible ? I have no idea . Ethan . Breakfast . I checked his room . He 's not up there . Thought he was down here . No ? Ethan ? His bike is gone . Where 's he going ? He 's at the park . I 'll get him . You go do what you got to do . Okay . ¶ Check this out . ( beeping ) ( boys laughing ) Ah , yeah . All right . Yeah ! Nice bike . Thanks . My dad gave it to me . You live around here ? No . I live a few miles that way . Oh , So you came here to give us your bike ? No . I came to ride . I like to ride . Hope you like to walk , loser . Hey ! ( short cackle ) You want some more ? Ethan . Hey . Thank god . What happened ? Let me see . Did you fall off the bike ? No . Then what ? I told you last night- - You can 't just go riding off On your own like that . What were you thinking ? I don 't know . I just wanted to explore . We need to get you back to the lab . Come on . Damage detected . Please contact the nearest maintenance facility At your earliest convenience . I want to take him home . It 's a busted-up sweeper bot . It doesn 't work anymore . I want to take it . Kern : By the time I got to claypool , the team had already Let her slip away . They executed the containment scenario . She just got the better of us . We 're abandoning claypool . Sir ? Tonight . We 're moving the offspring to the contingency site . The teams know what to do . Yes , sir . And , gordon ... Taking into account last night 's break-in , Our investor would like that security threat eliminated Before we move the offspring . I thought you convinced him That she might be necessary . She crossed the line . We can 't take any more chances . Come with me . They 're moving the offspring . We don 't have to go in . They 're bringing it out . Tonight . We can get him ? The truck carrying the mobile incubator Will be heavily guarded . But if all goes to plan- - If we can pull this off- - we 'll have a few hours To get the offspring to the isea . I 'm sorry , but the word " offspring " just ... It-it feels so ... Alien . Look , I don 't know how we ... Astronauts Are gonna pull off a truck heist without ... There 's a vulnerability In claypool 's infrastructure . I 'll detonate an explosive on the main transformer As soon as the offspring truck is clear of the building . With the power cut , The system will drop the garage gates to protect the building . We can then split the truck off from its security convoy . Okay , what about the guys driving the trucks ? We 'll neutralize them . Oh , we 're neutralizing now , are we ? We 're not . I am . Can you drive a truck ? Yeah . Then worry about that . The rest is on me . No , well , we 're all at risk here . Sparks gave me an order to kill you before they move it . This is our only chance . Okay , rabbit , let 's fix you . So , they just grabbed your bike for no reason ? I could have stopped them if I was stronger . Don 't move . Don 't be so hard on yourself . It was two against one . I should be stronger . Service bot : Damage detected . Please contact the nearest maintenance facility At your earliest convenience . ( whirring ) They were hurting the bot . Seriously , if you keep moving , I 'm gonna turn your mouth off . Can you help me fix him ? Got my hands full Fixing you . Are they gonna throw him away ? He looks pretty beat up . I don 't think he 's able to perform his function anymore . What 's my function ? We made you ... So that you could find your own function . That 's why you 're special . Nobody wakes up on this planet and knows their purpose . But I 'm sure you 'll find yours . He 's come a long way since then . ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . For accusing me of locking you out of ethan , Or for barging into my apartment in the middle of the night ? You choose . You shouldn 't fret Over ethan rebelling against his programmer . You wanted a kid , you got one . It doesn 't concern you We no longer have access to his programming ? I can 't speak to your concerns as a parent , But ... We set out To create a machine that approximated a human , And he just asked me what his function is . Ethan is questioning his own existence , john . It doesn 't get much more human than that . Hey , sorry I missed the facial lesions . John said little man was a trooper . He was much more than that . He 's changing , charlie . He 's thinking about things- - Not just processing , but thinking . ( laughs ) hooray ! We 're making a neurotic . That seems like cause for celebration . You want to get a drink , or we can eat some food ? You eat ? Of course you eat . I mean , you hungry ? Look at me : I 'm thinking . I 'm actually meeting someone . Orion ? Odin . You 've been spending a lot of time With this all-father of the gods . What do you actually know about this guy ? I know he minds his own business . Yeah , but I bet if you ran a search on him , Mr. Perfect wouldn 't seem so perfect . You ran a search on him ? I mean , if I did , I 'd just be looking out for you . If you did , it wouldn 't feel that way . What 's happening in there ? My transport team was prepping for extraction when The incubator developed a leak . The cloud appears to be generating on its own From inside the containment chamber . Get inside and find out what 's going on . ( mechanical hissing ) ( beeping ) Engage manual override . ( chirping ) ( whooshing ) ( door whooshes shut ) I 'm a few steps in . Visibility is limited . The source of the leak is not immediately apparent . It 's a particulate emission of some sort . There 's a similar substance adhering to the walls . I 've got a sample . I 'm moving towards the tank . It 's definitely the source . I can 't make out the leak . Sir , you 're not going to believe this . ( alarm sounding ) What 's happening ? Offspring heart rate dropping . Respiration , too . Revive team , move in ! Revive team , hold . Heart rate right at 60 bpm . Davis , report . Davis ? Did we lose comms ? No , sir . Comms are good . Davis isn 't responding . Dr. Davis ? Dr. Davis ? ( beep , whoosh ) We have a problem . Service bot : I appear to be outside my designated service area . Turn the lights on , will you ? Why can 't we fix him now ? It 's bedtime . I 'm not tired . I want to fix him . It 's not up to you , ethan . We 'll fix him in the morning . I appear to be outside my designated service area . Why 'd you do that ? He needs our help . Lights . Inside . Molly : Okay , five minutes . Kryger : You ever hijack a truck ? No . But I have docked a spaceship . Same diff . They called off everything . They 're not moving the offspring . Why ? Something happened to it , or is happening to it , But they never got it to the mobile unit . Okay , now what ? We 're scrubbing this . No ! It can 't be over ! You heard the man . We 're finished , we 're done . No , we 're not . Maybe I can get you down there . What ? I 'm sorry , didn 't you say that was impossible ? We still have a honey bomb on the main transformer . I can blow it . I can use the threat to clear the lab . Let 's just shoot each other here A-and save them the trouble . Let 's ... Just let him talk . The ir defenses Will go dark on the outside . I can override a service door . The first floor camera system reboots in sectors , From the outside in . If you can stay ahead of the reboot , You 'll be able to move undetected To the central elevator that serves the lab . It runs on its own power . And you won 't be able to call it If you 're not authorized , So I 'll get to security , I 'll send it up . No way . This is suicide . Even if we do get down there , how are we gonna Bring the offspring up ? Tupperware ? We 're not bringing it up , are we ? I need to see him . I need to know what he 's trying to say to me . You don 't have to go . Molly , you remember what it did to both of us up there . Do you really ... Do you really want to go through that again ? I can 't walk away now . Screw it . Screw it , I 'm already dead . If you go , I go . Okay . Good . I need a minute , okay ? Molly ? Take your shoes off and go get ready for bed . We 'll be in to check on you in a minute . Molly ? Gina , lock up for the night , please . Gina : Doors locked . Hey , shoes . Why ? It 's been a long day , ethan . You want me to take My shoes off because it 's been a long day ? I want you to take your shoes off because they 're muddy , okay ? Molly ? ( chiming ) John , I 'm sorry this is a message , But if I heard your voice , I don 't think I could say this . I can 't let it go . I don 't expect you to understand that . Molly ? Molly : But if I don 't come back , In time , I hope that you 'll realize that I didn 't Have a choice . And please don 't come after me . I don 't want to risk ethan losing both of us . Molly ? I love you . Bye . Gina : Incoming v-chron from molly . John , I 'm sorry this is a message . But if I don 't come back , In time , I hope that you 'll realize That I didn 't have a choice . And don 't come after me . I don 't want to risk Ethan losing both of us . I love you . Bye . Let 's do it . Thanks for coming on such short notice . We had just finished dinner when you called . Uh , I hope you don 't mind . This ... Odin , John . John , odin . John : Hey . Uh ... Hey , sorry if I ruined your plans . Not at all . Glad we could help out . What 's going on ? Uh ... It 's , uh ... Molly . I-I ... I think she 's in a tough situation . It 's okay . Go . Do what you need to do . If anything suspicious happens , just call the police , okay ? Uh , okay . Ethan : Dad ? Hey . There 's nothing to worry about . Julie and her friend are gonna stay here Till I come back , okay ? Is this about mom ? No . No . Don 't worry . Just-just go back to bed . Hey . It 'll be okay . Thank you . Of course . Hey . Remember odin ? Molly : Here , put this on . What 's happening ? The camera kern mounted picks up Their infrared security . All seems quiet . ( beeping ) Security 's down . Let 's go . What the hell is going on ? 20 seconds to sector two . My guys say the main power transformer overloaded And exploded . Check it out . I want to know exactly what happened . And find me kern . ( whirring ) Here we go . Sector one 's back . Emergency protocol . This is not a drill . We have five minutes to evacuate . Sir . Director sparks needs to see you right now . I 'm gonna take him . Stick to the plan . Nowak , get upstairs . Where have you been ? Dealing with molly woods . She 's been Taken care of . It 's not here . We can 't wait . Come on . Wait , wait , wait . What are you doing ? Getting us a ride . I have his prints . How do you know the room is clear ? Would you rather stay here ? Kern : Fire 's spreading . You should evacuate with the others . I 'm not leaving . If this fire gets out of control , we 're gonna want To put as much space between us and this Before the hook and ladders show up . Kryger : You okay ? Yeah . Are you sure you 're ready to meet this thing ? I 'm ready . Thanks for coming with me . Just remember not to trust anything you see down there . You won 't know what 's real or not . Don 't worry . I 'm real . Sir , we need to move . Okay , let 's go . ( elevator beeping ) I thought we were evacuating . Who 's coming down ? Gordon kern . We 're not going anywhere . ( sighs ) They cut the power . Kern . We 're out of here . He doesn 't move . I trusted you , gordon . You 're making a huge mistake . Perhaps . But you made an even greater one . Fan out . This is your target . Here , take my hand ! ( movement outside ) ( movement nearby ) ¶ ( gunfire ) Molly ! Are you okay ? Yeah . What the hell 's going on down there ? Oh , my god . ¶ ( gunfire ) Why ... ? I 'm s ... I 'm sorry , molly . I couldn 't let that thing live . Where is it ? Where did it go ? Kern : Molly , if you can hear this , Get the hell out ! Molly ? I didn 't want it to end like this . I lost katie once . I can 't lose her again . No . No . I 'm sorry , molly . No ... ( crying ) No . Oh , no , no , no , no . Katie . No , wait , katie . Oh , katie . Oh ... No ! Katie . ( movement nearby ) Dad . He needs our help . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

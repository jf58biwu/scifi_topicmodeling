 - ( Theme music playing ) - ( Beeping ) Reporter : The survival of Oswald Danes turns out to be the first incident in a much bigger story . The amazing thing about the miracle is not that no one 's dying . It 's not that the human race has become immortal . It 's that it happened to everyone at the same time . So now what we have accumulating are people who should be dead , but aren 't . We have to start manufacturing painkillers immediately . Jilly Kitzinger , Mr. Danes . I 'm something of a talent spotter . - I don 't need you . - I disagree , Mr. Danes . Someone 's trying to erase Torchwood , right ? What if they 're also trying to erase anyone who 's ever had - any contact with Torchwood ? - Go get him . ( Grunting ) I have a car . All right , just drive . Drive drive . - What the hell is going on ? - Welcome to Torchwood . What happened to you in there ? Something happened to all of us , not just me . Miracle day arrived and we all came out of it changed . But why do you think people accept you as an expert ? ( Chuckles ) I 'm no expert . But I 'm a free man . And since the miracle , the White House has said nothing . Scientists have said nothing . I think the establishment is scared into silence . I survived . I can say what I want . Such as ? Well , is anyone paying attention to the profits that the drug companies are making ? We need drugs more than ever . But I think we should take all those pills , those tablets and those potions and give them to people free . Yes , that 's what I 'm saying , because that 's how radical the world needs to be right now- - free drugs , free health care , free access for all . Woman : You really think that 's practical ? Oswald : Who 's to say what 's practical anymore ? That 's pre-miracle thinking . - Who told you to set me up ? - Rex ! P-put the gun down . Because everywhere I turn the whole C.I.A. Has been poisoned against me by you . - Now who told you to do it ? - I don 't know what you mean . Bullshit ! You set me up , Friedkin , and you got paid to do it . Now technically we both know that I can 't " kill " you . But you see , the beauty of this miracle is if I shoot you just right , then maybe you might live in agony for ... Who knows how long ? Maybe 1000 years . Now you think about that . Because I 've always wondered what part of the brain is memories or personality or what lets you control your own bladder . - No , don 't ! - Tell me ! ( Stammering ) I don 't know who they are . I never did . They just paid me over the years . They 've been there for decades and I can 't- - couldn 't stop them . It 's too late . Look , they 've- - they 've only ever contacted me on one telephone number . - Get the number . - Yes , I know that . Thanks . Yeah well , hurry up . I was right about the alarm . The police are on their way . Esther is tracking them . Uh , confirmed . There 's a unit on 5th heading for Riverdale . - North or south ? - North- - I mean , heading from the north going south . Gwen , one car from the north . On it . Doing it . They only contact me . They call me through that . But listen , Rex , you won 't find them . I never did . They 're everywhere . They know everything . Well , I just have one more thing to say : - Don 't go deaf . - What ? - ( Gunshot ) - Aah ! - ( Siren blaring ) - ( Thunder rumbling ) You took your time . One unit on Tacoma . Jack , you 'd better move . They 're right on top of you . Go go go go go ! Not bad , team . Not bad at all . - What did we get ? - We got a cell phone . So whoever made the miracle , now we 've got contact . - ( Theme music playing ) - ( Beeping ) ♪ Torchwood : Miracle Day 4x03 ♪ Dead of Night Original Air Date on July 22 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ( Drums playing ) Anything ? Any news ? Jack : Yeah , don 't worry . It 's good . They 've moved Rhys and Anwen to a safe house , location unknown . But they 're in the custody of Sergeant Andy Davidson . Well , we 've got his number . Have you called him ? That line 's been decommissioned . I 'm trying , okay ? Okay , that 's my bloody family , so hurry it up . Right , here we go . Found new mobiles for everyone courtesy of Jack 's Cashpoint card . - I hope I didn 't clear you out . - Not a chance . That account 's been gathering interest since 1906 . And some new clothes . Just some basics . If they don 't fit , then tough . Jack . And food- - everyone is panic buying so I had to go to the petrol station and all they had was crisps . Oh , I think you mean gas station and chips . - Crisps are called chips over here . - Thank you , miss translation . And a mobile is a cell phone and by Cashpoint I think you mean A.T.M. Don 't ever leave my side . It is absolutely mental out there . Some TV show said that the miracle was a virus and then some website said it was the plague , so they all run to the shops and they clear the shelves . Oh , and the new cult out on the street , that march ... They call themselves the soulless . Apparently everlasting life has robbed mankind of their souls . Turns out Friedkin was telling the truth . His handset was only contacted by one number . - I traced it , but it hits a vine . - What 's a vine ? A vine is when you trace a number back but the trail branches out . Then it branches out again and again , piggyback those secondary numbers spreading out almost exponentially . So instead of tracing one number you 're chasing 500,000 . ( Groans ) - What ? - You should be in the hospital . Hey , less of the sympathy . He can keep working , the bastard . You 're gonna keep just going on and on about your kid , huh ? Do you want her here with us ? Hmm ? Maybe she can go play in that corner where the lead paint chips look extra tasty . Got you that from your mates , the soulless . - Did you get me painkillers ? - Sold out . Unlucky . Oswald : I think we should take all those pills , those tablets and those potions and give them to people free . See , now this guy has got a good idea- - free drugs . So who is this guy Oswald Danes ? Rex : Eh , he just got lucky . He 's a convicted murderer and pedophile sentenced to death on miracle day . All the same , he 's on every channel . We need to investigate anyone who 's making a profit out of all of this . On it . Doing it . Go back , search family history- - everything . I know . Thank you , I know what I 'm doing . And this lemonade- - this lemonade is flat . It 's lemonade . It 's supposed to be flat . What , fizzy fizzy lemonade ? It 's fizzy in the U.K. And flat in the U.S. Hmm , just about sums it up . How are we doing on the money ? I can 't trace where the bribes came from but I 'm going through Friedkin 's patterns of behavior instead . He 's a section chief . You 're not getting into those files . Oh really ? You want to bet ? This Torchwood software , it 's serious . What are you doing with that ? Nothing . I 'm just putting my numbers in . - Whose numbers ? - My sister 's . You 're gonna phone your sister ? No . Esther , what the hell is the matter with you ? Don 't you know how serious this is ? The C.I.A. is gonna be monitoring her calls . I 'm sorry , okay ? - Well , think next time . - Come on , Rex . - She 's not used to this . - I 'm not used to this either . - It doesn 't make me stupid . - That 's enough , okay ? And who the hell put you in charge ? I think the C.I.A. did . You 're a member of Torchwood now whether you like it or not . I 'm sorry , okay ? I really am . I just- - I 've never done all this before . You guys have . I sit at my desk and read blogs for a living . Rex , it 's my sister . She 's just- - she 's not well . Yeah , it 's irrelevant . I tried to do a search on morphic fields , 'cause that 's the best that I could work out , that some sort of morphic field suspended the human race . But it 's got to be more than that . What do you mean ? It 's like there 's some sort of energy behind this- - a will , a drive , a consciousness . 'Cause this miracle , it 's more than people just surviving . They are so alive . You saw Lyn , that woman at the airport . She should have been paralyzed but she just kept on going . And I 've seen bodies at the morgue , burnt and broken , still alive , staring right at me . They weren 't even allowed to be unconscious . It 's as if something is willing them to go on , each and every individual forced into life . That was me ... All the way through my accident- - wide awake . And you could feel everything that happened ? It still hurt ? Yeah . So what did the search say ? That 's the problem . Everybody 's had the same idea . Morphic field ... Gets 10 million results . Then I 'll go through them , all 10 million . See , that 's what I do when I 'm at my desk . Hard work . I know . ( Chuckles ) He cockblocked the A.T.F. I have no idea what any of that means . The A.T.F. Is the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . They asked the C.I.A. about information on a warehouse here in Washington , but Friedkin forwarded the request - onto ancillary three times . - Gwen : What 's ancillary ? It 's a paper chase . It 's a guaranteed way to lose something in the system . Esther : So if he tried to stop people from seeing the warehouse , then maybe he was paid to protect it , which would indicate there 's something in there . It 's at 3rd and Boston Southwest . All right , so we 've got a mission . First thing we need to do is steal a new car . Uh , ahem . So who 's giving the orders ? Okay , Torchwood , what do you say ? We need to steal a new car . - ( Car alarm blaring ) - Got one . There 's somebody 's dry-cleaning back here . ( Chuckles ) And it 's my size . I 'm taking these . My clothes are stinking . Ladies , avert your eyes . That includes you , World War II . These new phones aren 't bad . The camera is good quality too . - ( Camera clicks ) - ( Laughing ) I know you didn 't just take a picture of me changing my pants . - You 're changing your pants ? - Pants mean trousers . Are we really on a mission here ? Yeah well , maybe this is the way Torchwood does things , mate . Yeah well , maybe you want to drive on the other side of the street , mate . - ( Horns honking ) - Gwen : Mmm . Esther : 3rd and Boston . That 's the one . Security profile says the guard 's on a quarterly rotation . That means he checks in with base every 15 minutes starting on the hour . All right , so we gonna come up with a plan , or is that just the American thing to do ? ( Honks horn ) - Hi . - Hi . I wonder , can you help ? We 're a little bit lost . Sorry . The British abroad , hopeless , honestly . I think we 're trying to get to Boston Avenue . Is it Boston- - Boston Road or Boston- is it Boston Street ? - ( Thuds ) - You 've done that before . - So many times . Jack : Esther , how much time do we have ? Esther on phone : 11 minutes . I can unlock it but only by tricking it into thinking it 's booting up for the day . That means all the lights are gonna come on , - all the computers are gonna boot up . - Do it . - Esther , you keep watch . - Right . - Done . - ( Gun cocks ) Let 's see what 's in this . Let me see that . Huh . It 's drugs . ( Laughs ) It 's legitimate drugs . What is it ? Metanec . Metanec is a painkiller , yeah ? Hallelujah . Thousands of them . Millions of them . - Phicorp . - Yeah , you know Phicorp , Jack . Phicorp 's a big pharmaceutical company . We got Phicorp back home . I mean , it 's everywhere . It 's worldwide . These are the same pills that I 've been taking . The beauty of it is is that they 're non-narcotic . They keep you painless and wide awake . It 's the perfect drug for the new world order . There was a delivery yesterday . When was the first one ? Way back . Oh , hold on . Deliveries go back at least a year . All for drugs . All from Phicorp . Oh my God . Bigger on the inside than the outside . These are all painkillers ? They 're ready for a war . No . They were ready for the miracle . Phicorp knew it was coming . You , come here . This woman 's husband strangled her . She doesn 't die so he keeps strangling her . And now her brain is soup and her hyoid bone- - her neck is like dust and you 're telling me that 's not murder ? We 've charged him with assault . That 's not enough ! This is what murder looks like now . Don 't blame me . We 're not even allowed to say " attempted murder " anymore because murder is impossible . - The whole system is breaking down . - It 's the N.I.H. They say you 're late for some kind of panel . ( Vera groans ) - ( Alarm chirps ) - ( Engine starts ) Man : I 'm looking at an additional half million people a day . What 's up ? The 50 % of pregnancies that spontaneously abort are not aborting . Genetic mistakes are suddenly viable . - No baby is a mistake . - ( Groans ) What hospital are you from ? Providence . Dr. Carey Murphy . Yeah , I was a Catholic too once . I got better . We 're talking brain outside the skull , no skin , no face , suffering . - Yeah , these are mistakes . - ( Pills rattle ) Oh hell . Oh hell . Sorry . Um , but actually , I think we can help . Jilly Kitzinger . Hi . Pain management in newborns is something that we 've already got going on at Phicorp , so we can roll out a strategy . Fine , we 've got a bigger problem . Somebody got off a plane from New Delhi in Boston last night and now we 've got cholera . I warned you . I seem to recall no shortage of clean water in Boston . Turn on a tap , gentlemen . Can we talk about the situation in the E.R.s ? I 'm gonna keep warning you . We 're gonna see more of this every day . Man : We 're not done with the birth issue , guys . They 're putting contraceptives in the water supply in India , mainland China . That 's something we might have to look at here . That 's not a serious proposition ? It doesn 't matter what happens in the long term if we lose the heart of our health care system now . We need more facilities , more space , but who 's gonna organize it ? Man : We 'll put it on the agenda , but I think we 're getting pretty far off track here . Can we talk about the contraception option with some professional distance , please ? It 's been raining on and off ... ( Grunts ) Like it wasn 't end of the worldly enough . ( Sighs ) We don 't deserve this miracle . We 're just gonna screw it up like we always do . Human damn beings . I 'm including myself . Phicorp needs feedback from medical staff . Why don 't you come and talk to us ? My schedule is a little full . Okay . That 's fine . But you gave a commencement speech last year at Columbia about your college mentor , how she worked for Doctors Without Borders when they were just starting out in Biafra . And you said you wanted to find a way to give back like she did . Did you find that ? I- - I was talking about field work . Everything is field work now . I mena , FEMA- - FEMA is hopeless . It 's a pot of glue that still thinks it 's a racehorse . Phicorp can really do something . You 're just out to make a profit . Well , companies profit by turning situations around to their advantage . But isn 't that how every human damn being gets through their day ? Come in and say hello . Just once . - Maybe . - I 'll take that as a yes . Oh God . I 've got to go . Busy busy . But you have my card . You won 't regret it . And that 's a promise . ( Sighs ) Okay , we do a deep search on this Phicorp . I want to peel back security and find everything . - I can handle company history . - I can do European operations . Whoa whoa whoa . Wait a minute . After we do all this research , then what do we do ? We go in , whether that means infiltration or confrontation . So we 're just gonna sit on this information ? Come on , guys , seriously ? I mean , we 've got a major link between an international corporation and the miracle and we 're just gonna keep it to ourselves ? We got this far on our own . Yeah , but see , it 's not just about us . Not anymore . This is about doing the right thing for the state and for the people . - Jack , he 's got a point . - Okay . We need a friend with connections . Got any ideas ? All right , my senior instructor at Langley- - I 'm pretty sure he 'd still give me a chance . - He 's C.I.A. - He 's ex-C.I.A. Look , I know this is a risk . I know that . But it 's a risk I 'm willing to take . So what do you say ? Okay . Okay . And I 've got proof . I 've got photographs and documentation . But I can 't compromise you or your family , sir . You know I would never do that . So maybe we could meet somewhere neutral . How about the lobby of the Freeville Hotel ? It 's on North Street West . The Freeville Hotel . ( Sirens blaring ) ( Helicopter flying overhead ) - Damn . - ( Police radio chatter ) ( Men shout ) ( Helicopter flying overhead ) What 's the use ? We discovered this Phicorp shit , but everyone 's been turned against us . We 're still on the run . We can 't trust anyone . Esther : They can 't have gotten to everyone we know and they can 't be tracking the cell phones , ' cause they 're new . I warned you . Whoever these people are , they 're good and they 're ready for us . Which puts us back at square one- - we tackle Phicorp ourselves . ( Chuckles ) And is that standard Torchwood policy ? I suppose it is , yeah . You know , you dress like it 's World War II , so I don 't expect you to be up on current events , but there is no Torchwood . It 's dead . Gone . - Buried . - It 's us . As far as I can see , you got all your staff killed . - They were my friends . - Your dead friends . Esther : Rex , don 't . " Rex , don 't . " You want me to stop ? I 'll stop . Who the hell are you people anyway ? Rex , hold on . Hold on . We 're got to work together on this , Rex . Don 't , Rex . Don 't . Don 't ! Rex ! ( Rock music playing ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Groans ) ( Sirens blaring ) The city is going wild . Everyone 's out drinking . Nobody knows whether it 's a party or a wake . - Jack : My arm is itching . - Poor baby . - I think it 's infected . - You 're worse than Rhys . It 's itching because it 's healing . Now stop it , Jack . Oi , Jack . Mortal man , mortal needs . We 've got work to do . I am so mortal . ( Dance music playing ) ( Man shouting ) Hey , baby . What 's up ? Yeah ! Whoo ! There 's a poem- - " I have been one acquainted with the night . I have walked out in rain and back in rain . " It 's probably not about walking . I suppose it 's about death . Yeah . The poets are the ones who are really gonna suffer , aren 't they ? All those poems about death . ( Laughs ) Well , it was Robert Frost , so maybe it really was just about walking . ( Groans ) My apartment 's that way . 10 minutes down the freeway , turn off at 11th . Home . You 'd be arrested on the spot . And that 'd be worse than this ? I 'd be safe , be warm . Wouldn 't be holding you back . I don 't know if I can do this . What 's wrong with your sister ? She 's not sick . She just ... can 't cope . Never could . I 'm the youngest but I 've always looked after her . Well , she 's in that direction . But I 'm warning you , you give up now and you 'll prove that Rex was right . - Can 't have that . - No , we can 't . ( Sighs ) Miles to go before we sleep . Mm-hmm . ( Dance music playing ) Scotch . - What are these ? - Sobriety chips . Got two-month chips , six-month chips . They got a whole bowl of 10-year chips around here somewhere . People are throwing a lot of sober out the window tonight . Sorry I can 't add to your collection , unless you want a button . Oh , you damage that coat , I 'm jumping over this bar to protect it . Jack . You like the coat ? Brad . Passionately . What 's the latest from the White House , Candace ? Are we getting any sort of clarity ? Well , off the record , George , this miracle is so impossible a lot of high level officials are thinking the word " alien , " meaning an intervention or at least an influence from beyond this world . But so far still , no one is willing to say it out loud . Well , bringing the discussion back down from outer space , we saw some action today . The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case asking for adjustments to the life sentences of convicted criminals , because these days , how long is life ? Candace : Right , the argument is that a life sentence is now potentially infinite . Tomorrow we 've got Oswald Danes in our Atlanta studio . ( Car engine starts ) It 's okay ? " For the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible , and we shall be changed . For this corruptible body must put on incorruption , and this mortal shall put on immortality . So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption , and the mortal shall have put on immortality , then shall be brought to pass the saying which is written : ' Death shall be swallowed up in victory . ' " - ( camera clicks ) - " ' O death , where is thy sting ? O grave , where is thy victory ? ' " ( sighs ) - Rex : Dr. Juarez . - ( Gasps ) ( Groans ) I 'm gonna need you to dress this again . And I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to insist . ( Breathing heavily ) ( Groans ) Oh , damn it . I 'm gonna need your help- - you know , medicine and care- - just until I clear my name . I 'm just taking your word for it that you 're not a traitor . ( Chuckles ) Oh yeah . But , you know , you 've already given me drugs , taken me into your home . We both have the power to make a case against one another . - Nice . - Yeah . So what you 're saying is that 's what our relationship comes down to , blackmail . Huh . Well ... - ( Groans ) - No . When you put it that way , it 's kind of hot . Rex , I 'm exhausted . Me too . ( Groans ) ( Moaning ) Do you have protection ? What for ? Can 't die now . Don 't need nothing in-between . That 's not how it works anymore . A lifetime of regret just got even longer , that 's all . Fine . You 're calling the shots . Yes . Yes I am . - Ouch . - Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm okay . Come on . " The sting of death is sin , and the sake of sin is the law . But thanks be to God , which giveth us our victory through our lord Jesus Christ . " Hey . - Hey ! - I was just leaving . Just leaving . - Carla , is this the guy ? - It 's him . No , you got me mistaken with somebody else . - Oswald Danes , the child killer . - No . If you don 't want to be recognized , don 't put your face on TV ! Let 's get him . Officer ! That kid , he 's harassing me . Oh , not fair , man . You know who you got there ? - Look at him . - It 's a mistake . - I think you should go home , sir . - Man : That 's Oswald Danes . Do you know what he said about the girl , the one he killed ? " She should have run faster . " That 's what he said . Go home right now . ( Police radio chatter ) Thank you . Thank you very much . I- - I 'm just trying to get back to my motel . ( Panting ) Do you think you could give me a lift ? It 's just off 278 . Yeah , get in . Thank you . Oswald : What ? Is there a problem here , officer ? You can get out , sir . Oh shit . All right . Of course . Of course . Here we go . Huh , here we go . ( Grunts ) Don 't you worry , sir . Nothing on your face . You 'll still be nice and handsome for the TV . ( Grunts ) You should have run faster , Oswald . Are you saying the pharmaceutical companies knew it was gonna happen ? Only one company- - Phicorp . You okay ? My- - my mother had a massive stroke last year . I- - I had to make a choice . God , if I 'd just kept her alive a little longer . If I had been warned . They even gave me their card . Phicorp . Some woman called Kitzinger . She wants me to go to some kind of private meeting . Well , you know you have to go and find out more . I need to know what they 're doing . Rex , that 's your job , not mine . What ? Hey , listen , I 'm serious . I need you to do this . You break in here , threaten to expose me for helping you and now you want me to , what , spy for you ? - Yeah , will you ? - No . Phicorp knew , Vera . Okay ? They could have warned us . Think about your mother . I mean , you let her die- - - I- - - I 'm taking a shower . Let yourself out . And I don 't need to see you again . Gwen , I had to call . I thought of a thing . - Gwen : Are you drunk ? - A little . You ? Some of us have to work . Your turn to talk . I know . I was thinking about how you 're immortal and I 'm dying . And what I wanted to say was ... We 're good , aren 't we ? You and me . A good team . I missed you . I was thinking if this had happened a bit sooner ... - I know . - ... He 'd still be here- - Ianto . Dead friends . I 'm sorry . I wish he was here now . Not much of a team , is it ? But we 've still got each other . You and me . Just like the old days . We don 't need anyone , do we ? - Sorry . - We don 't need Rex . I had to bounce a signal off Paraguay , but it 's to say thanks . - ( Anwen cooing ) - Oh my God . Rhys , oh my God . Can you see me ? I can see you . Can you see me ? Yes , I can see you . A little bit too much of you , not enough baby . - Put up the baby . - Hey . - ( Cooing ) - Give your mom a wave . We don 't need anyone . Right , Gwen ? Gwen ? - Hey . - Anwen . Hello , little sweetheart . - Hey , mommy , look . - Hello , darling . We 're safe and we escaped . We 're fine , I promise . And I 'll be home as soon as I can . I will . Andy said he can move us with police supervision back to Swansea , so we 're all ready and waiting for you . Hey , it 's mom . It 's mom . Hello , mom . ( Tires squeal ) ( Grunts ) Rough night , Oswald ? Oh God . What was it ? Was it Jill ? No , let me guess . Jillian ? Jilly . Jilly Kitzinger . Told you you 'd need me . Now we have a very important meeting to go to , so you can get cleaned up on the plane to Dulles . Dulles ? Why ? These are the times that make men , Oswald . So it 's your choice- - stay where you are or stand up tall and stride across the skin of the world . Which is it ? Well , let 's see . If that 's a promise of help , you 'd better deliver , Miss Jilly Kitzinger . I will , sir . I promise . I 'll hold you to it . Lead on . ( Cell phone ringing ) Yeah ? Vera : You left me your number 'cause you knew I 'd give in . Okay , I 'm not the C.I.A. I don 't go undercover , but maybe I can get you inside . Yes ! I feel awful , which is amazing . I thought we broke up . Yeah well , there 's work to be done . So they just look like contact lenses , huh ? Mm-hmm . Look at the laptop . They 're the one piece of Torchwood tech I kept . It 's like a camera . See ? Okay . - Side ... - Huh . ... To side . See ? That 's very very cool . Where 'd you get it from ? A distant moon of a distant star . Ha ha ha . Really , where 'd you get them from ? A distant moon of a distant star . I am loving this hangover . I knew mortality would make life more intense . Ow ! Hey , don 't touch my pills . I need that for legitimate pain . - I need them too . - You weren 't impaled . You should have seen the other guy . Oh , that face . Rex doesn 't like his jokes too gay . No , Rex doesn 't like men in their 40s acting like they 're 20 . Oh , we 've got a winner . Now hush . Esther is sending me text . So we can communicate with the I-5s just by typing . Hello , Esther . I 'm Gwen . But there 's no sound . But we 've got lip-reading software . Look at me . Right at me . - Mm-hmm . - Now say something . My name is Rex Matherson representing the Central Intelligence Agency . Computer : My name is Rex Matherson representing the Central Intelligence Agency . All right , all right . That 'll work . - I can get inside with those . - Problem . The I-5s , they 're isomorphic , biometrically tuned in to me and me alone . - Seriously ? - Mm-hmm . If anyone 's going on this mission , it 's got to be me . - Yup . - Huh ? - What ? - ( Chuckles ) We very much appreciate your coming . Phicorp knows how busy you must be . No , I don 't think this is right . I was here to see a Miss Kitzinger . No , this is the meeting . I think you may know some of these people . Andy Collier from Johns Hopkins . Shelby Lewis , she made the shortlist for the Lasker Prize . Okay . We 're starting in five . Oh , if you 'll excuse me . - First door on your left . - Thank you . - Where 's Rex ? - No , I 'm not Rex , I know . Hello . Long story . Go back to the meeting and keep Jilly Kitzinger for as long as you can . Go . - Are you giving me orders ? - Yes , go . - She did good , Dr. Juarez . - Yeah . How did you talk her into it ? Well , it 's not exactly a professional relationship . Oswald Danes . - What 's he doing there ? - Tell her to follow Oswald . No no . No way . Let her stay on the mission . Gwen find out anything about Oswald Danes ? Nothing special , apart from being a monster . He just chose the right day to be executed on . He 's got nothing to do with this stuff . I 'm sorry , no . I have been forgiven by- - a substantial number of people have forgiven me . I can feel that in my heart , in my guts . And forgiveness , it 's like a tide or storm . It clears the air . I 'm very lucky to have been forgiven , and I feel very- - I feel very blessed . And I think of forgiveness as a cure . Gentlemen , Mr. Danes . ( Phone rings ) Yeah ? Who was that woman ? She works for me . Are you at the meeting yet ? Yeah , but it 's not a meeting . It 's some kind of presentation . All right , well , keep the line open . I want to hear . Hello , and thank you for coming . I 'm Congressman Patrick Morganthall . Some of you are listening to us from Los Angeles ... A Congressman . ... Others from Phicorp locations in Cleveland , DC , Dallas , Singapore , Hong Kong ... Phicorp was ready worldwide . But if they knew about the miracle , does that mean they caused it ? Our modern drug prescription system has served us very well for many decades , but times have changed . Times have changed a great deal . The need for drugs is far outstripping the access to the people with the means to prescribe them . Something has got to change . And that is why later today I will be introducing legislation to make all prescription drugs , all painkillers , antibiotics- - almost all medications available without a prescription . Think it 'll , what , multiply sales by tenfold ? Pssh ! Try 1,000 . They 're cashing in big time . Where 's Jack ? And I am not just talking about making new laws . I am talking about making an entirely new society . Now this is a massive enterprise , ladies and gentlemen . But it 's up to us . All of you are experts ... - Jilly just left . - Oh shit ! ( Door handle rattles ) Call her . Call Jilly Kitzinger . ( Cell phone rings ) Dr. Juarez , hello . It 's Vera . I 'm in the screening room . I have some- - can you come here ? - Can I ask you some questions ? - Sure . Sure . Is everything all right ? You sound kind of shaky . - ( Laughs , claps ) - Oh . - Good work , Gwen Cooper . - ( Phone vibrating ) - You gonna get that ? - It 's not mine . They 're calling Friedkin . Or they 're calling us . Go go . Yeah ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Who are you ? Who am I talking to ? Who is this ? Nothing . It hits a vine . But they could have traced that handset . Yeah , I know . Come on , we gotta get the hell out of here , out of D.C. pack that stuff up quick . What are you smiling for ? - ( Siren approaching ) - I think we got ' em worried . Let 's go . And let 's find out where the hell Jack went . Okay , you ready for me ? Yeah , sure . I 'd apologize for being late , but it wasn 't my fault . I was needed across town . Still made it . And this will be going on live , yes ? Can you tell me who 's interviewing me ? Yeah , it 's , uh ... Sod it . I suppose a man like you was always on his way . You met with Phicorp today . Why ? You 'll have to ask them . Did they mention the name Jack Harkness ? Have you heard that name ? Never . Why do you ask , Jack ? I figured if you cared that much about the name , it was probably yours . I just want you to talk . What about ? I saw you on television saying you feel forgiven for taking the life of a child . That 's a lie . I know that 's a lie . How do you know that , Jack , - with such certainty ? - Tell the truth ! The murder of Susie Cabina , you don 't feel sorry at all . Oh , the truth is she flaunted it- - her innocence . Most people , they get hit or whatever , it 's hours before the bruises rise up . But they showed right away with her . It was like I was painting on her . And she looked so beautiful . I thought it couldn 't get any better than that . But , oh , Jack , I swear to you , right then at the end I felt her life leave and she left through me . Yeah . You know that feeling ? I think you do . And I relive it every single night , because that was the best moment of my life . Now I understand . You 're doing all this ' cause you 're searching for one thing- - one simple thing : Execution . We 're without death so you get to live . And it 's killing you . Jack , what are you going to do with that recording ? We 're in a broadcast center . Figure I might broadcast it . Excellent idea . If only I didn 't have to do this . Boys . - Take that recording off him . - Ah ! God ! I did visit Phicorp and they were kind enough to offer me protection . In exchange for what ? The message . Don 't hurt him , just get rid of him . It was nice to meet you , Jack Harkness . Well , you can hurt him a little , but not the face . That 's how it 's done these days . Let me be clear . I 'm not calling for free drugs . I 'm calling for free access to drugs . I want every American to have the power to be able to buy whatever they want and need without a prescription . ( Grunts ) If that means that some drug companies are gonna make a profit , then maybe that just ensures that they 'll take better care of us . ( Grunting ) Because government has abandoned us . ( Grunting ) And I 'm thinking of companies like Phicorp . They 'd never abandon us , because they need us . We 're talking about medications . I have to say that I 'm somewhat of an expert . I spent a lot of long years in solitary confinement , a dangerous man companies like Phicorp tried to help . They put me on a drug regime - with every drug known in the world . - Did you see him in there ? Did you see Oswald Danes ? Did you touch to him ? - Did I what ? - Oswald . Did you touch him ? They stick with us . And I 'm asking you now to join with me and this great enterprise as we all walk across the fragile skin of this wide world together . The future is now endless and it 's terrifying . I 'm offering you my hand to walk on this long journey together . Walk with me . That 's all I ask . Walk with me .

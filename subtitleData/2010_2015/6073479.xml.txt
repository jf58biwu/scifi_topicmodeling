 - Previously on warehouse 13 ... Your sister , she 's an incredibly dangerous woman ! - What happened to claire ? The music box , it infected her . It was destroyed , so we had no artifact to neutralize . The only solution was to put claire In an artifact-induced coma . - You 're my sister , And there 's no way I 'm leaving you like this . Make way for their royal majesties ! Make way ! - God save the queen ! All : Hip hip huzzah ! Hip hip huzzah ! Greetings , royal subjects and visitors from the future . The brave knight who triumphs in today 's tournament Shall win my daughter 's hand in marriage . Let the festivities begin ! huzzah ! Uh , you do know how juggling works , right ? No , man . You 're supposed to catch them . That 's the juggling part ! Oh , knave . Your fly is undone ! Oh , loser ! - He 's awful . Oh , forsooth ! 'tis another loser who vexes me ! - Is he okay ? He 's having a heart attack ! Somebody call 911 ! you okay ? Mister ! - Call 911 ! - Don 't panic ! Don 't panic . I mean , we could say they 're cajun-style . Oh , my god . Tell me there 's cereal . When 's abigail back from her trip ? Why ? She doesn 't cook either . No , but she orders in really well . - The new dark vault is ready . You have my permission to come back to the warehouse . The new vault is marvelous . Say what you will about paracelsus , But the man had a knack for security . I 've incorporated a few of his ideas , albeit it in a fashion More suitable to my beloved steampunk motif . I need a little help getting the artifacts moved back in . Oh ! We have a ping . - Oh , thank god . - Yes ! - I 've been so bored . - From a renaissance faire . - Not it . - No . N ... Tell me there 's something else behind door number two . - No , but thanks for playing . Now wait a minute . Are you out of your mind ? Renaissance faires are awesome , man . They 've got swords and wenches , and you can be A knight or a knave . Which one do you want to be , huh , knight or knave ? I want to be a federal agent . You 're already a federal agent . All right . Well , I want to be a knave . You don 't know what a knave is , do you ? - It 's a good thing . - Uh-huh . Be a knave . Take the federal agent with you . Claudia and myka can help me here . Where is claudia , by the way ? - Oh , you know what ? I 'm gonna go track her down , and we 'll meet you there . Excellent . Oh , tell me there 's cereal . - Spices , tea , home remedies . - Methinks not , sir . Ooh , look ! Swords ! My god , this is everything I 've ever wanted . Okay , now it 's everything I 've ever wanted . Wait , jinksy , hold it ! - What , what ? - Costume rentals ! - No ! Come on , man ! You can be a knight ! Or not . Not is also an option . But , man , I thought Halloween was , like , gay christmas . You don 't like costumes ? - I 'm not a cliche . I-I don 't watch the oscars either . Really ? Oh , maybe I 'm gay . - Tournament today , 3 : 00 ! - Federal agent . I need to speak with whoever 's in charge here . S 'wounds ! An officer of the court . 'tis an honor , milord . - Yes , fine . Can you please just tell me who 's in charge ? T 'would be the king , milord . Thee must seek a royal audience . - Of course I must . - cool . - Follow me . Make way ! Make way for the officers of the court . Yes , ' tis my good fortune to be not only the sovereign Of this fair county , but also its proprietor . - You own the faire ? - Forsooth ! 'tis so . - That 's awesome . Mayhaps milords would fancy a round of darts or knucklebones ? Knucklebones ? That sounds like ... Like something that you can play later . Right after we play " tell the federal agents Everything you know without the ' thees ' and the ' thous . ' " - Okay . This way . Look , a ren faire is an interactive experience . And people come to play along , not just watch . I got to stay in character . It 's good for business . The faster you start talking , the faster you can put What about the jester with the scepter ? Who is he ? - And where can we find him ? I 've never seen the guy before . Plus he was wearing a mask ! How about a list of your employees ? I mean , we got tons of jesters . Half of ' em are paying customers , even , And the customers are the good ones . Well , there must be some way to narrow it down . How many jesters can there be ? Look around . And that 's just the line to the john . - Gadzooks . - Told you I 'd be back . Let 's get started . Despite everything artie told you , you 're here anyway . - She 's my sister . I didn 't leave joshua stuck in an inter-dimensional prison . I didn 't leave steve dead , And I 'm not leaving claire like this . Look , claude , you know I just had a huge wake-up call , And life is shorter than you ever think . I can 't imagine mine without my sister . - So what you 're saying is ... - What 's the plan ? ¶ So since we don 't have the artifact That turned my sister into carrie , we can 't neutralize it . And the artifact energy has to live somewhere , So if you take it out of claire ... - We got to put it in something . Wait , you know that combining artifacts ... Is dangerous ? Yes . And you know that my sister has been in a coma for 15 years . I think a little danger is worth it , don 't you ? - Bob dylan 's bus transfer . - That 's right . To electric marked a major change in his music . You know , it might not have been dylan 's best move , But the uproar from his fans make this artifact ... - Extremely dangerous ! And also very useful to what we are about to do right now . Okay , moving on . Alessandro volta 's biscuit barrel . Which is a way to store the energy . So the bus ticket will transfer the energy From claire into the biscuit barrel . Nice . - Exactly . Please note that I did not say anything About how dangerous that could be . Okay , what do you need me to do ? Well , since claire can 't hold on to the artifacts herself , We 've got to help her out . You take one hand , I 'll take the other ? These officers of the court would just like To ask you all a few questions . ¶ - Nope , nada , nyet . That jester that made the guy laugh , I just want to know if you 've seen him today . Not so , I 'faith , ne 'er e 'en then . - So would you recognize him ? - Good sir ! I shan 't recognize a knave under any circumstance . - Look , I just want to know if ... - knave , dost thou know How many knights it takes to changeth a lightbulb ? - Stop that ! - Dude , not cool ! This puppet is gonna see parts of you that not even your doc ... Whoa ! Surely he jests , fair knave . Okay , guys . Let 's just chillax , shall we ? Look , we just want to know if you know anything About the jester that made the heckler laugh . Not my shift . You guys ask oswald ? Oswald ? No , who 's oswald ? He was one of the guys onstage when it happened . So why wasn 't he here with all the other jesters ? Oswald isn 't a real jester . He was just filling in . He 's a doofer . - A " doofer " ? You know , a guy who does things . Like , the doofer gets hit with the pie . He 's the target for the knife thrower , The prisoner in the dungeon . He shovels the horse ... Sure , we get it . He 's the doofer . Now , where can we find him ? - Mm-mm-mm . - You little ... - I-I know . I know , walk away . - I just ... Dunk a punk ! Douse a louse ! Soak a bloke , 10 shillings ! Step right up , milords ! A mere 10 shillings . - Oh , no , thank you , milady . We just want to talk to your pal up there . Oh , nay , kind sir . Thou cannot . Not until milord hits the target . Well , milord is happy to oblige . - Thank you . All right . What 's so important ? You were onstage when the guy had the heart attack . - Oh , yeah . Poor guy . Wait , wait . That wasn 't my fault , okay ? I-I didn 't make him laugh . I am never funny . Ask anyone . - I think you 're funny . - The doofer 's been dunked . Great . Hey , look , no one 's blaming you , okay ? We just want to know what happened . - Ask one of the knights . I mean , ask the king . He was there . We already asked everybody else . Oh , of course , because the doofer is always The last one on the list . You know I was supposed to be a knight by now ? That 's what my contract says . I 'm sure they 'll make you a knight soon , ozzie . You get bumped up to lady-in-waiting next week . I-I 've been a doofer for three seasons . It ... no , no . I need to talk to the king . You need to talk to us , okay ? We want to know what you saw . Hey , look out ! You stop the cart , and I 'll get the girl ! - Pete , look out ! - Myka , look . It 's working . Claude , just hold on . - Mykes , her hand ! Is that it ? I don 't know . Bag ' em . - Okay . - Where am I ? Well , no evil jesters , no laughing hecklers , But I 'm guessing " mr . Toad 's wild chariot ride " Has got to be related , right ? 'tis all part of the spectacle ! Oh , forsooth . 'tis the grandest entertainment in the land . Maybe we should shut this place down . We 'd never find ' em . - What the hell was that ? I don 't have to tell you how bad this is for business . It 's very , very bad . A round of knucklebones for all ! All : Huzzah ! Come on , will you help me out here , boys ? Uh ... Milords , miladies , gather round ! We know a guy with a renaissance grudge Against his lordship . - Bad for business has got to be At the top of our disgruntled doofer 's to-do list . - I don 't understand . Where am I ? You 're at a hospital , a special hospital . - Who are you ladies ? - Well , my name is myka , And , um , this is ... - Uh ... I 'm claudia . I 'm your sister . - No , you 're not . My sister 's seven years old . Um , listen , there was ... there was a car accident , And you 've been in a coma for a really long time . - A coma ? Cars ? But that was ... no way . Come on . I don 't believe you . I don 't . I-I know . It sounds insane . - Yes , because it is insane . No , see ? That is claudia . See ? And I 'm ... Old . Oh , my god . I 'm old . You 're not old . You 're just ... you 're older . - How much older ? I ... 15 years . - 15 years ? That means you 're ... - 22 . - So I 'm 30 ? I 'm 30 years old ? How can I be 30 years old ? - Don 't worry ! We 're gonna get everything Sorted out , okay ? I promise . I missed the garbage concert . I missed the prom ! I missed graduation ! How is this gonna be all right ? - Just trust me , okay ? We 're gonna talk everything through from the very beginning . Just give me one sec . I have a feeling this is maybe gonna take a while . Yeah , I 'm just gonna put these back where they belong . - Thank you . And , hey , um , artie might be not so happy about this . You think you could soften him up a bit before we get there ? - Don 't worry about it . I 'll take care of artie . Okay , catarina , we 're looking for your pal oswald . - Um ... - target practice , look . - Another one ? You get the wizard , I 'll take care of the crowd ! Hey , get down ! Hey , get back ! hey ! Okay , neat trick . Now what the hell ? - Coming , princess ! Okay , okay . There you go . There you go , there you go . - Ah , some special effects ! Wow , best ren faire ever ! There you go . Not all on fire . I used to like magic . Not a mark on her ! What a show , huh ? ho-ho-ho . Huh ? Come on . Let 's hear it for king what 's-his-name . Hey , not so fast there , ozzie ozbean . - What do you want me for ? Look , I-I ... I 've never played a magician , And I 'm not even on the clock , okay ? That may be so , but wherever you are , chaos seems to follow . - Time to grill the doofus . And , um , I get a free room here At the bed and breakfast , Although it 's not so much breakfast anymore , so ... You got a lot of stuff . Oh , god , yeah . God , I guess I do . Um , I didn 't have very much when I came here , so I ... I don 't know , maybe I 'm just trying to make up for that . - Mm . What 's this ? Oh , this is ... um , ipad . It 's like a little computer . You can listen to music or read books Or surf the internet on it . Mm . The internet 's still around ? Dad said that 'd be a passing fad . Yeah , well , he probably didn 't think pants Were here to stay either . Uh , that 's for an xbox . Uh , video games . - Oh , like , um , donkey kong . yeah , except nobody plays do ... Yeah , just like donkey kong . I got to say , I 'm really hating this . - And I totally get that . I-I just ... nothing feels real . Wait , that 's it , isn 't it ? It 's a dream . It 's just a weird dream . I 'm just gonna wake up and be me again . claire , I 'm sorry . It 's not a dream . - It has to be . It has to be ! This cannot be my life ! - Look , it 's ... it 's okay . Everything is gonna be all right . Please stop saying it 's gonna be all right , ' cause it 's not . None of this is all right . I don 't recognize anything or anyone ! Claire , I 'm sorry . You 're right , it 's a lot . It 's a lot to take in , but you 're gonna catch up fast . You know why ? 'cause I did . What , you were in a coma too ? I was in a mental institution . You were ? Why ? long , long story , but I spent My formative years in a psych ward , And not to outdo you , but crazy girl carries A lot more stigma than coma girl . Look , yes , maybe there are some things you can 't get back Like the prom or the garbage concert , But we 'll catch you up on everything else , I promise . Besides , I hear high school 's overrated . I don 't think we missed much avoiding all that teen drama . - Wait . Is this ... - Your guitar ? Yeah , my strongest memories of you are with that guitar , Which probably has a lot to do With why I 'm completely guitar-obsessed . yeah , you are . Hey , do you want to see where I play ? Okay . - Okay . Alice ? Are you in there ? Wha ... okay . Yeah , ju ... sorry . Just go back to planning ways to kill me . - So what 's the plan ? - Don 't do that ! artie , do not start with me . Took you long enough . Where 's claudia ? She 's busy . You and I can handle this . There was a time when people actually did what I said . Oh , boo-hoo . What is the plan ? - All right . We are going to carefully load all these artifacts Back into the newly secured dark vault very , Very , very carefully . - Got it . Okay , listen , artie . I need to , um , Did you not hear me say " very , very carefully " ? Everything here ... everything ... is extremely unstable . It is critical that no negative energy ... This is not my first time in the dark vault ! - Shh , shh . - Although " vault " is a joke . Okay , this place is about as secure as a kiosk at the mall . don 't ... And how many times has alice escaped From that mirror anyway ? Which is why I have been working Night and day to install new security measures . Doesn 't anybody ever listen to me ? - Do not snap at me , okay ? You said you didn 't want any help with that ! aah ! No . J ... no negative energy now . I don 't know what 's making all these things happen . And yet you 're always there when they do . - Wha ... - I don 't know . Maybe it 's aimed at him ? Anybody that might want to hurt you ? No , look , look , I am just trying To get through my already humiliating day . All right , well , let 's start with the juggling . Tell us everything you did or touched leading up I-I did everything that I normally do . All the usual stuff , except getting my fortune told . You don 't usually get your fortune told ? - Oh , my god . The fortune teller ? Is tha ... did she curse me ? Am I doing all of this with my mind ? Well , stranger things have happened . What 'd she say to you ? - Madame dooriya ? Uh , she ... she asked me what I wanted , you know ? What ... what would make me happy . And I want to win the hand of the princess . I mean , not just the job thing ... I mean , I actually Want to go out with the girl who plays the princess . you are not a hero . To become a knight and win the hand of the princess , You must become a hero . - Okay . How ? - The cards will show the way . What else madame dooriya has to say . Wow . How many bags did we bring ? Madame d really wouldn 't like this . No , she really , really wouldn 't . All right , lady , secret service . We know you put a curse on this fine young man Right here , and we want you To hand over whatever it is you used to do it . I haven 't cursed anyone in years . Not since my ex-husband . Ribbit , ribbit . I didn 't even read the cards for this one . - Yes , she did . - Pete , look . - Oh . Let 's bag ' em . You ready , jinksy ? - Mm-hmm . damn it , nothing . - We got a gypsy on the run ! - Knight to b-4 ! - Wow ! Halt ! Depart the board ! You know they 're just using you , right ? Steve , go around that way and flank her . - Look out ! The white queen ! Okay , this thing 's just broken . - Hey , it 's time travel day ! - Steve , she 's behind you ! - Oh , no , you don 't , lady ! All : Oh ! - Lady just disappeared . - So did madame dooriya . - That was awesome . - Best ren faire ever ! - Okay , keep it . - Thanks . Wow , how did coffee get to be so expensive ? Oh , I have no explanation for that . So , you know , it 's not exactly the viper room , But the crowd is always enthusiastic ... Although , in fairness , that might be the caffeine . Weren 't you nervous to play in front of people ? yeah , definitely , but you know , pete kind of Talked me into it , and then after that first night , When they all clapped , Let 's just say I 'm addicted to more than just coffee . Would you play for me ? - Twist my arm . But , hey , you 've got to sing with me . Oh , I 've been in a coma for 15 years . I 'm pretty sure I 'm rusty . And I can guarantee you rolling stone Oh , thank god rolling stone 's still around . okay . ¶ ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba ¶ ¶ ba , ba , ba , ba - Wait . Is that ... - ¶ ba , da , ba , da , da Garbage , when I grow up . - Oh . - Since you missed the concert , I thought we could have one of our own . ¶ - ¶ cut my tongue out ¶ I 've been caught out like a giant juggernaut ¶ ¶ happy hours , golden showers ¶ on a cruise to freak you out ¶ go . - ¶ we could fly a helicopter ¶ nothing left to talk about ¶ entertain you Both : ¶ celebrate you ¶ I 'll be back to frame you ¶ when I grow up ¶ I 'll be stable nice . Both : ¶ when I grow up ¶ I 'll turn the tables - yeah ! Both : ¶ when I grow up ¶ I 'll be stable - Oh , yeah ! Both : ¶ sha-la-la , sha-la-la ¶ sha-la-la That we we 're just gonna be glorified stock boys . My keen sense of perception is giving me the impression What is wrong ? - what 's wrong , artie ? Everything ! Look , just ... calmly , calmly , just ... You see , there 's an energy balance in here that ... - Don 't patronize me , artie . - Patronize you ? liste ... My bad . Look , why don 't we just quietly work together ? You also never mentioned that we would be stuck In south dakota forever , And you never , ever , ever told us That we would be affected by artifacts ! You want to guess how many times I 've been whammied ? - That 's what this is about . You think that somehow An artifact has affected your health . Stop second-guessing me , artie . That is not what this is about ... Not at all ! Myka , you 've been whammied again . - I hate it here ! - Not so fast ! Damn it ! I 'm getting old . I used to be faster than the kgb . So this is why you ran out on us ? You were jonesing for a corn dog ? Which I would totally get , by the way . Why are you harassing my grandmother ? She didn 't do anything wrong . That 's right . You did ! Idiot girl , you used mother shipton 's cards On that doofus . - It 's doofer . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . You ? I-I thought you liked the doofus . Oswald . - You do ? You like me ? Like , like like me ? So then why curse him ? He could have been hurt . - I know , and I 'm so sorry . I was ... I didn 't mean for anyone to get hurt . I was just trying to help ozzie . That I know he has so he could become a knight . So , when he came into the tent , I pretended to be dooriya . I didn 't know it was gonna be dangerous . Of course it 's dangerous ! Idiot girl ! Mother shipton created tragedy across all of England . - Well , then let 's make sure Those cards don 't cause any more . - All right , watch your eyes . - Nice trick . All right , now that we know ozzie 's Off the hook , how about some corn dogs ? No , wait ! This cannot be stopped . The cards have been dealt . They foretold that the doofus will become a hero , So become a hero he must or die trying . I usually get paid for this kind of information . Did she say " die " ? Like , die die ? - Yes , die ! - Die ! - No one 's gonna die , okay ? Steve , why don 't you help oswald pick out a nice hat . - Let 's go buy a hat . - Does he really have to die ? Either he 's a hero or a dead doofus . - Okay , so how do we fix this ? Oswald is the only one who can fix it . He must become ... - a hero , right ... As you said . Is there any other way ? - Or he could die ! - Would you stop saying that ? The cards are presenting oswald with opportunities . He should have been the one to call 911 Or to rescue that little girl ... Or kept steve out of checkmate . He could be a hero . I know he can . - Really ? Have you seen him ? I mean , really looked at him ? - Well , she has a point . The cards will continue to challenge him until he does . All right , well , I guess it 's time for oswald to knight up . His goal is to win the princess , and to do that , So the cards will probably challenge him there . - The time ... I must go . I have an exorcism in 20 minutes . - Okay , explain something to me . If you really like this guy , Why would you help him win the princess ? Because when you really love someone , You want them to be happy , even if it isn 't with you . Wow . My ex-girlfriends had more of ... a scorched-earth policy . Don 't let anything happen to him ? Don 't worry . I 'm on it . Now that I know where and when , I 'll make sure the odds are stacked in his favor . Good , because the last card that I dealt him ... Was " death . " Myka , please . Don 't , don 't ! no . No ! Talking down to me does not help ! Look , I 'm not talking down to you . I 'm just talking you down . See the difference ? See , all this rage ... don 't ! Oh , oh ! All this rage is just ' cause you 've been whammied . - It 's not just that . - That 's right . - It 's everything . - Right . - It 's this place . - Uh-huh . - It 's a thousand things . - I understand . Do you know that I went through my cancer scare alone ? - Uh , yeah . - Do you know that ? - I 'm sure . - Alone ! yes , I know . And ... and you didn 't really need to . You ... you chose to keep it to yourself , see ? And what if I spend the rest of my life alone ? Is that my fault too ? Is that what you 're saying ? Answer the question ! - Oh , my god . The music box . - Unh . You shot me ? Well , it wasn 't really a shot , per se ... More like an aggressive hello . - You shot me ! It just makes me angrier ! Oy yay , oy yay , oy yay ! Gather round ! 'tis time for the royal tournament to begin ! - No , no , no , I can 't . - Oh , yeah . I-I can 't . I can 't . I can 't . - Yes , you can . - No . - There you go . That a boy . - Uh-oh . how ? With clear eyes and a full heart ... You can 't lose . I 'm nearsighted , and I have arrhythmia . Look , dude , you can do this , okay ? You have to . Otherwise they 're just gonna keep coming , And you don 't want to be chased your whole life , do you , huh ? All you have to do is beat this last card . How bad can it be ? - Well , you had to ask . who challenges me ? You ? - Me ? Oh , him . - Prepare to die , mortal ! - No , no , no , no , no , no ! He 's got to do this himself . whoa , whoa . No , I can 't do this . - No , no , no , you 're doing it ! - I can 't ... - ozzie , no , you 're good . You 're doing great . Keep him in the game , okay ? I got an idea . - Hey , no ! - I can 't . You 're a knight now . Use your sword . Aah ! here , catch ! Ozzie , here ! Unh ! - Ozzie , look out ! Nothing is worth this , not even the princess ! - Hey , where you going ? - Coward ! - Leave me alone ! - Catarina ! I 'll take you instead . No ! All : Huzzah ! Hip-hip , huzzah ! Hip-hip , huzzah ! we did it . Both : ¶ I don 't want to fall asleep ¶ ' cause I miss you , babe ¶ and I don 't want to miss a thing ¶ oh , I don 't . I don 't want to miss a thing . Will you tell me everything that happened while I was sleeping ? Ooh ! Well , that could take a minute . We need snacks . - Okay . Mom and dad must be so proud of you . Claire ... Um ... Listen , mom and dad ... Mom and dad aren 't with us anymore . - What do you mean ? They 're gone . They were ... They were in the car accident that put you in a coma . - They were ? - Claire , please ! - No ! The car ? That car . They 're dead ? I 'm starting to remember . I know I should have told you sooner . I just ... I-I didn 't know ... - but I wasn 't . I saw it . I saw the crash ... So I couldn 't ha ... I wasn 't in the car , was I ? - No ... You weren 't . You ... it 's ... it 's very complicated . I-I ... Is your sister there with you right now ? Great . Myka told you . Yeah , listen , everything 's okay . No ... Actually , it isn 't ! Don 't defend him . He shot me ! guys , get back ! - Oh . I 'm sorry . I 'm really , really , really sorry , really ! I just ... I thought that ... - Bob dylan 's bus transfer ? Volta 's biscuit barrel ? You think I didn 't already think of that ? Look , the music box does not work that way . ooh ! - Look , the energy Has to be transferred into a living human being . If you 'd only asked me , I wo ... can 't we just tesla her ? in addition to the strong possibility That myka might be extremely upset by being shot again , There 's also the issue of the energy from the tesla Boosting her telekinetic energy , so ... - So , what , then ? - Catch , artie ! Oh , it 's not artie . It 's me . Hi . Just giving claire the grand tour . Nobody knows the stacks like myka . You remember claire , right ? - Hey , again , myka . - Hello , claire . - Nice of you to drop in . - I 'm sorry , myka . - Oh ! We only have a few minutes and not many options . Well , you 're not gonna put myka in a coma , artie . You can 't . - Claudia , not her ... Me . He has to , don 't you ? Seeing her like that , I remember now . The music box , how angry I could get , mom and dad . - It wasn 't your fault . I know . I know . But somebody has to do it ... No , no , I 'm not gonna let you go back to that . There has to be something . - No , but there 's not ! You 've tried everything , haven 't you ? For 15 years . I 'm sorry , claire . - It 's okay . - No . No ! I was there too . I knew the music box was dangerous . Put me in the coma . - No , claudia . I will not let you or myka or anyone else suffer . Listen to me . Thank you for today . If I only get one day , I am so , so glad I got this one . I love you , little sister , And I am counting on you to fix all of this . - We have to do this now . - Okay . Wait . ¶ when I grow up Both : ¶ I 'll be stable Both : ¶ when I grow up ¶ I 'll turn the tables - I 'll find a way . I promise . all right . Yeah . I now pronounce thee sir oswald the lionheart . All : Huzzah ! And offer thee my fair daughter 's hand in marriage . uh , gramercy , your majesty . It pains me greatly , but I must decline . Verily , my heart belongs to another . - You knew , didn 't you ? You knew that oswald would save her , So you told catarina to run in the ring . - Well , jinksy , my friend , I had a feeling that ozzie could be a hero For someone he really cared about . Oh , look , someone got left out . Can 't let that happen , now , can we ? - Mm-hmm . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , uh , I don 't know if you doth realize it or not , But , uh , I was pretty helpful with yon knight over there . ooh . - Yeah , well . - That 's so exciting .

I 'm sorry , claudia . I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about claire ... Sooner . I didn 't want you to go through all that pain . I 've always done ... I always will do anything To keep you from getting hurt . Please don 't hug me . The only thing that could make this worse is you seeing me cry . Okay , from now on , we do everything together . That goes for you too . We 're a family here , And none of us has to go through anything alone ... Ever . damn it .

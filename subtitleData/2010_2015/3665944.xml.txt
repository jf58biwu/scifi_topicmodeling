 find dyson frost yesterday . the next move is mark benford 's . dyson frost ? it 's your move . i took this picture . she saw something she shouldn 't have and got in trouble with jericho . the second that jericho knows that i 'm still alive ... ( GRUNTS ) they 'll find me , and they 'll kill me . tracy stark- - i know you took her . now you 're gonna give her back . i can 't give you your daughter back . then we go to war . you will be shot 3 times on march 15TH . it will be your gun , agent benford . ( MAN ) demetri ? yeah ? the box is here , but the gun is gone . my first term was a bitch . i could have used you , stan . i 'm sorry i couldn 't bring you in . i don 't want you to think i-i 'm harassing you . i know. you 're just trying to save the world. good-bye . she was signaling her handlers . ( simon ) i should have known- - two moles , in case one is caught- - and not one person in the office would suspect it 's you . ( mark ) today is more than just the beginning of your career . today , along with a badge and a gun , you 're gonna get a story about your first day on the job . every special agent has one . some are funny . some are tragic . some are boring . but today won 't be the most important day in your career as an fbi agent . that day is somewhere down the line . you won 't see it coming . it sneaks up on you . it 'll most likely be an anonymous moment- - a crossroads where you 're asked to do something , make some kind of personal sacrifice for the good of someone else , and that person may never know your name or see your face or even understa what you did . but you 'll know . and isn 't that why you 're here , after all ? because you can be counted on to do the right thing at the right time , every time . welcome to the fbi . well done. nicely done . all right , ladies and gentlemen . see me for your partner assignments. congratulations . ( wEDECK ) nicely done . ( dEMETRI ) special agent vreede- - is it " vreed-y " or " vreede " as in " freed " ? oh , i don 't know . i got benford . no. switch with me . why ? he 's a legend . he 's done it all- - surveillance , counterterrorism , trafficking. come on . do it . whatever , but you gotta take it up with wedeck and get it approved . done. thank you . of course . yes ! janis , who 'd you get ? no partner . headed to analysis. boring . you know , i got it worse . i report to you . ( CHUCKLES ) ( LAUGHS ) i mean , how could that be ? i scored higher . yeah , in , like , one category . come on , marcie . we 'll have fun . yeah , we 've been a team since quantico- - booze and bullets . yeah , well , what am i , the mascot ? no , you 're like our captain . yeah , you 'll probably outpace all of us . i 'm sure of it . yeah , we 're--we 're sure . ( mark ) interview of marcie turoff , agents benford and noh questioning . march 12 , 2010 . first thing we 'd like to know is- - who came after us in that parking garage in d.c. ? i don 't know . who came after us in the parking garage in d.c. ? i don 't know . on to the next . are they still afts ? i don 't know . demetri . who killed ian mCkinnon ? come on. let 's go . is that who 's coming after me ? let 's go . we need those answers . yeah , but there are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first . listen , dem . you think i don 't have march 15TH circled in my calendar , too ? we both know there 's a chance you 'll die in three days . look , you keep chasing down leads . i 'll let you know when we 're ready for your questions , all right ? hey , janis , i need your help in here with marcie . me ? what , you got something more important than grilling our mole ? no. of course not . what were your duties ? every week , i 'd take whatever information there was in the mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop . who recruited you ? i was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit . what was his name ? all in due time . he asked if i wanted to be a part of something big . and you said yes . you think i sold out my friends and my country , but ... you don 't know me . why don 't you enlighten us ? come on. don 't you remember my flash-forward ? no , you don 't , 'cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what i saw . ( WHOOSH ) i was incarcerated . that didn 't cross your mind when you shot six of your fellow agents ? ( FIRING ) it did . but even though i was in jail , i was happier than i 've been in years . ( WHOOSH ) i thought we 'd have to beg for life without parole . i told you they 'd come around . until i tell them who recruited me , i 'm indispensable . for the first time since i got here , i actually felt like i was important . ( wEDECK ) i need you mark . these are our guests from washington . and while they 're grateful for all our efforts in apprehending agent turoff ... oh , no. you gotta be kidding . director middleton feels more comfortable having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her . and where he can give the press conferences himself . hear me out . we know her. we can read her . just give us one more day . i know it 's frustrating , but let 's try to get something positive done today- - like maybe get back to what caused the blackout . now i 'll be out of the office for a couple of hours , so give me an update . dyson frost- - he 's our best lead so far . where are we ? i 've left four messages . haven 't heard back . i 'm afraid he 's just toying with us . the guy 's been wanting to talk to you for 19 years , and now he 's playing hard to get ? shel , see what you can get by tracing frost 's phone . yes , sir . hey , i just got a call from l.a.p.d. they 've got a ballistics report saying that mark 's gun , the one that 's supposed to kill me in three days , was used in a muer last night . ( mark ) so what do we know from the eyewitness reports ? 55-year-old , in his cot , presumably asleep . at 3 : 33 a.m. , the shooter walked up to him , and a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say ... i knew it would be you . i just didn 't want to believe . " i knew it would be you . i just didn 't want to believe . " the shooter must have had a silencer on your gun . ( MUFFLED SHOTS FIRE ) ( GASPS ) he plugged him three times in the chest at close range . uh , do you want to put that thing away ? sorry . thanks . physical description ranging from ... 5 ' 5 " white guy to a 6 ' indian . another dead end . wasn 't there something about a car ? uh ... somebody said they saw a 1970S blue sedan drive away- - foreign make . that 's a start . ( SCOFFS ) l.a.p.d. ' S gonna forward the victim 's effects to us . can 't wait to sift through that . forget about the shooter . who 's the one other person we know who handled that gun ? there were 40 agents in that evidence room . they were all cleared months ago . one of those agents marcie ? ( dEMETRI ) marcie ! stop ! stop ! you guys never give up . i need to talk to her . she 's in our custody now . you can 't take her . she 's part of our investigation . i 'm just doing my job , same as you doing yours . who 'd you give my gun to , marcie ? i don 't know . come on. who has it ? i don 't know . come on. don 't do this . we were friends . look , i 'm sorry . really , i am . all i heard is that you 're supposed to die in l.a. what ? give me more specifics . who does it ? when ? it was a voice on the phone when i called to report the gun in lockup . who 'd you call ? a number . it was different every time . look , that 's all i know . there isn 't any more . look , you 're gonna die in three days , and there 's nothing you can do to stop it . i 'm sorry . ( WOMAN ) come on . marcie , come on . marcie ! marcie ! marcie ! ( charlie ) come on , come on ! sweetie , what is the hurry ? we 're here . i told him we 'd be here by 2 : 00. we 're late . who ? dylan ! ( charlie ) hey , dylan . nuts to you , squirrlio ! toot ! toot ! toot ! toot ! come on , dylan ! okay , i 'm coming . did you know about this ? absolutely not . charlie , who arranged this ? i did ! i got dylan 's phone number from him when he was in the hospital . he was very insistent about this specific park , and now i know why . do you normally come here ? well , the house is just around the corner . right . this is fun . come on. you go first . look , i-i can sit on a bench or something . it 's fine . doesn 't have to be that way . ( charlie SCREAMING AND CRYING ) charlie ? ( lLOYD ) dylan , what happened ? ( oLIVIA ) let me see , sweetie . ( dylan ) we bonked heads . did he hit your teeth ? let me see , baby. okay , charlie , let 's see. open up . ( dylan ) sorry , charlie . i 'm bleeding . okay. let me see . ( dylan ) she okay ? open your mouth . here we go , charlie . i want you to do something now . just--just grab my hand , and when it hurts , i want you to squeeze as hard as possible , okay ? is that all you got ? come on . you try a little bit harder than that. that 's good . does this mean i can 't go to the carnival , mommy ? no , i think you 're gonna be just fine for the carnival . i think you 're gonna be okay . yeah , that 's good. i 'm starting to feel that a bit now . listen , i 'm just gonna go back to the car and get a bottle of water and a towel . you 'll be okay . okay . yeah. i see carnivals in your future. come here . i wanna go . i know. come here . it 's okay , sweetie . assistant director wedeck ? that 's me . come this way . she 's ready for you . thank you . madame vice president . ( SIGHS ) good to see you , stan . it 's been quite a while . please sit . thank you . ( SIGHS ) thanks for coming on such short notice , stan . how is everything ? you want to tell me why the hell you dragged me out here ? ( CHUCKLES ) it 's nice to know my new position hasn 't changed your attitude towards me . does the name jericho ring a bell ? they 're a private contractor operating over in afghanistan . i 've heard of them . agent benford look into them a e back . yes ? well , in my security briefing this morning , i learned that jericho 's c.e.o. just tripled the security around his malibu compound . i think you should take a look . wrong department . nsa is who you want to call . i don 't want them to know . i need this done off the books . the vice president doesn 't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman . in my vision , it was clear that jericho had done some things that threatened our national security . the same vision where you saw yourself as president ? ( WHOOSH ) as a matter of fact , yes . and i was there because jericho did something that triggered a political crisis . i can 't find out anything about what they 're doing . but if it 's bad enough to bring down president segovia , it must be significant . i 've been keeping a close eye on every move they make , and something is happening right now . are you sure you don 't know what it is and seven if i did , dave and i go back 25 years . listen , these flash-forwards are coming true . segovia is going down . do you want to be out with the old or in with the new ? no one knows your gun 's here in l.a. yeah , too bad marcie couldn 't tell us who 's using it . so i 'll run this car info , see if anything pings on a 1970S blue sedan . we 're gonna get this guy . yeah . got a second ? jericho- - you used our database to look into them a few months ago . is that a problem ? no , no . just curious why you did . it was a favor for a friend- - wanted as much information as i could give him , which wasn 't a lot . a friend ? do all your friends ask you to research third world military contractors ? he had questions about his daughter 's death . she was serving in afghanistan . he thinks jericho is involved ? the things he told me- - they were in confidence . oh. i can respect that . thanks . do you mind if i talk with him ? maybe ask him a few questions ? what 's his name ? aaron stark . good luck finding him . he 's off the grid . i don 't even know where he is or how to track him down . thank you , mark . sure . hey . just heard on the scanner- - l.a.p.d. ' S in the middle of a high-speed chase . driver--ross webber- - has been spotted with a gun . car they 're following- - '71 blue sedan . the shooter from the homeless shelter ? how many criminals are driving the same disco era sedans , right ? any idea where they 're headed ? ( mark ) there 's your blue sedan . where is he ? right inside. a bunch of people ran out. he 's got hostages . where in the building is he ? second floor . who 's talking to him ? no one yet . you think he 's just gonna come out on his own ? captain doesn 't want us to do anything till he gets here . ( GUNSHOT ) ( MAN ) shots fired ! get down ! stay down ! ( WOMAN SCREAMING , OFFICER SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ) ( WHISPERING ) you hang back . i talk to him , try to make sure he releases the hostage . once he does , you take your shot . ( LOWERS VOICE ) sounds good , except for the part about me staying on the sidelines . no way you 're going down there . listen , i 'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person . march 15TH--i know that 's the day you 're supposed to die . who says you didn 't get shot three days earlier ? ( MAN ) who the hell is that ? ! ( NORMAL VOICE ) i 'm right here ! ( LOWERS VOICE ) try not to shoot me . oh ! stop . ( NORMAL VOICE ) oh . i told them the only person i want to talk to is randy savage ! macho man ? yeah , i dig that . uh , that 's not me . my name 's demetri . oh , god ! ( CRYING ) you don 't turn around in four seconds , i will kill her , demetri . doesn 't matter to me . she 's just a saleswoman . that 's what she gets for causing the blackout. i said stop ! okay . ross , you still have that gun , right ? i 'm gonna take the clip off now . here we go . gone , buddy . and , uh ... ( GASPS ) on my ankle , i got a gun , man . i 'm gonna take that off , too , okay ? we 're not worrying about that anymore . ( CRYING ) hey , what were you saying , though , about ... about how salespeople caused the blackout ? that 's- - that 's a fascinating theory . i 'd like to hear more about it . they made us buy cell phones . uh-huh . see , before everybody had a cell phone , nobody ever blacked out . none of this ever--stop moving ! ( SCREAMS ) okay . you think i won 't kill you ? you 're about just plain incorrect . ( CREAKING ) ( WHIMPERING ) i 'm not afraid . ( WOMAN CRYING ) it 's okay . everybody 's scared of dying , man . ( CRYING ) she is . look at her ... i 'm scared of dying ... all three of us . it 's what makes us human , don 't you think ? you 're scared . that 's fine . see , when people get scared , judgment gets clouded . i 'll be honest , man . you have made some really bad decisions today . but you can make a really good one right now ... if you just give me the gun . ross . come on . let me save your life . ( SCREAMS ) uhh ! ( WOMAN WAILING ) ( GASPING ) e.m.t. says he 's stable. we can question him in the hospital . it 's not your gun . serial number is totally different . your gun 's still out there . so you almost got yourself killed for nothing ? yeah , i guess so . ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) all right . you took him down , saved an innocent woman . that 's fantastic work . what i can 't understand is , if you thought that gun was gonna kill you , i mean ... cops had the place surrounded . he was never gonna make it out ofere anyway . that 's why i needed to get to him , man- - so i could ask him why . ugh . do you remember ... that speech you gave my first day on the job ? it was all about being the kind of person who could be counted on to do the right thing at the right time . and , man , since october 6TH , when i didn 't see anything , i have had a lot of trouble being that person . and i need your help . why ? ( CHUCKLES ) i mean , look at me . if you think i 've been making good choices lately , you 're crazier than i thought . i 'll do anything to help you , demetri , so i 'm gonna tell you something , and i really want you to listen . get out of here . you and zoey just get out of here . ( WHISPERS ) i 'm not running away . that 's right. you 're not . you 're being smart . just promise me you 'll go somewhere safe . ( HORNS HONK ) ( zOEY ) special agent noh , do you recognize exhibit " h " ? yes. it 's a copy of my notes taken while witnessing the transaction . and those handwritten notes are your only record of the events ? well , it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange . hmm . wow . that is very good . agent noh , who taught you to draw ? i guess i 'm just naturally artistic . wow. lucky guy , right ? now your description here of the alleged buyer--oh , here , further down in your notes- - can you read that for the court , please ? uh , " caucasian male , average height / weight , dark jacket , baseball cap . " hmm . when my client was booked , he was photographed wearing a red jacket , not a dark one , wasn 't he ? yes . and he clearly has a goatee , does he not , agent noh ? yes . so which individual bought the stolen computer disk , agent noh- - the one with the goatee , or the one in your artistic notes ? because they 're obviously not the same person . ( MAN ) objection- - argumentative . ( JUDGE ) sustained . do i get to answer that ? not really . no further questions . i 'm done with this witness . oh , you can go now . come on. there 's no need to take it personally . that was a win that you just turned into a loss . ( CHUCKLES ) it was never really a win , because you were wrong . wow. you know what ? um , i 'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs . you know what ? look , i 'm--i 'm sorry. i will turn the defense attorney off . okay , that would be an instant improvement . why don 't you let me make it up to you ? can i ... take you to dinner ? ha ! you gotta be kidding me . what ? there 's not a chance in hell i would ever go out with you . ( PLATE SCRAPES ) hey . ( SILVERWARE CLINKING ) hey . how are you ? ( KISSES ) good . sit down . i want to talk to you . it 's okay . wow. you 're beautiful . shut up . what is wrong with you ? nothing . ( CLAPS HANDS ) it 's good . you know , i wasn 't supposed to be there that day . what day ? al gough was supposed to be mark 's partner . i switched with him , and because i was mark 's partner , i was covering the bust that led me to you . all these tiny little decisions we make , you know , without thinking , they--they all- - they all line up to lead us somewhere ... somewhere good . yeah . so i want to ask you if you will ... marry me . ( LAUGHS ) baby , we covered this . i-i said yeah . no , i want to get married right now . okay . i want to get married tomorrow . then we get on a plane and we go to hawaii . we stay there through the 15TH , maybe through april 29TH . listen , maybe we don 't ever come home . want to do it ? are you serious ? i 'm serious . hell , yes ! yes ? of course ! oh , i love you. mm .

( SIGHS ) to be honest , i-i used his autism as an excuse to get away from her . even the thought of that makes me ashamed now . i thought i was doing the right thing at the time . you 're damned if you do , and then you 're damned if you don 't . yeah , maybe we just ... choose to live in the moment , you know , just grab the ... good things in our life when we recognize them . i have to go . look. wait . i 'm not trying to argue against mark . he 's a brave man doing something extraordinary . yeah , he is . ( SIGHS ) this does kind of put me in the lancelot-trying-to - persuade-guinevere position . oh , you did not just compare yourself to lancelot . ( CHUCKLES ) ( CHUCKLES ) yeah , well , the only other metaphor i had involved protons and neutrons , and believe me , under the circumstances , i went with the stronger choice . i know that we 're feeling the same thing right now . ( LOWERS VOICE ) how do you know what i 'm feeling ? because i 'm in that room on april the 29TH . that wasn 't an accident . ( WHOOSH ) ( WHOOSH ) ( WHISPERS ) this scares me . it should . who the hell are you ? it 's okay , aaron . i work with mark . i 'm a friend . ( HORN HONKS ) you mind telling me how you found me ? there was a computer in echo park doing web searches for a " jericho parwan afghanistan , " " jericho central base " and " jericho murder u.s. soldiers . " that library 's 2 miles from here . and this is the 14TH cash-only hotel i 've hit . well , here i am . now what ? mark didn 't want to tell me why you were so interested in jericho . but some very powerful people would love to take them down . all they need is proof . they got my daughter . they kill her ? they tried . she 's still alive . but in your file it- - tracy 's alive . she was here , but jericho found her and to her back to afghanistan . i gotta believe i 've only got so much time left to find her . wait. you 're--you 're- - you 're going to afghanistan ? sure am . i know you were in the service and everything , but how are you planning on getting there ? fly into uzbekistan , cross the border at termez . and you 're doing this with a u.s. passport ? yeah . you 'll be dead before you leave hairaton . i don 't have a choice . do you know why jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago ? she saw jericho wipe out an entire village . if i could help you get to tracy ... do you think she would tell us the whole story ?

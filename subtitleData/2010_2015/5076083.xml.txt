 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... He killed my friend . An alchemist used a stone to keep my body from aging . If I blow your heart out of your chest , you think that will stop you ? I 'm gonna guess that 's Charlotte . No ! Myka ! A poison dart . A 15-year-old boy ? Yeah . Nick Powell . Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? Nick , hey , how 's it going man ? Hi . We could be looking at ovarian cancer . Hey , Mykes . Hey . What are you doing up ? It 's time for my 3 : 00 a.m. Sandwich . It 's 1 : 00 a.m. I 'm still on east coast time . What 's your excuse ? Oh , wait . No , no , no , no , no . Let me guess . You 're rereading the manual . Again . Do you remember our first night here ? Uh-huh . It 's all so new and exciting . World of endless wonder . I 'm just so glad that we got to see it . Okay . What 's wrong ? Pete , I have cancer . No . No . You went to the doctor three days ago and , and you 're just telling me now ? " I have cancer . " And you just tell me ... Myka , are you gonna die ? Myka ? Something wrong ? What ? No . No . I was just thinking about ... Stuff . Let 's go get you your sandwich . Yeah . Shh . Can 't wake up Pete . Why ? 'Cause I 'm starving . I 'm going to steal his 3 a.m. Sandwich . Okay . Hey , Claud . Uh , Steve was looking for you earlier . Oh , yeah . No I gathered from his copious texts , emails and phone calls . Hey-o ! Oh , so close . Why aren 't you asleep ? Sleep is for suckers , okay ? It 's hoagie time up in here . Aha ! Listen , we got a ping . A big one . This is something , I 've been after a long time . This is an old ... Nick ? You 're here . Listening . Yeah . Uh , Claudia and I just got back . That 's nice . It 's late . You look tired . I thought ... I thought you told me , you would find a place for him , that was not here . Well , yeah . I mean there aren 't a lot of alternatives to foster care for a kid like Nick . I have got a little more digging to do . Then good . Go dig . Listen , in case nobody 's ever told you this the Warehouse happens to be a secret ! Oh , good . Thank you . Let me warm that up for you . Sucker ! Oh , no ! Come on . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . Wait . Is there any way this ping could wait until tomorrow ? No . No , can 't wait . I 've been waiting for years . We have to act right now . Or what ? You won 't make Warehouse employee of the month ? Of the century ! Listen , we let this slip through our fingers right now we may never get it again . Or worse . Somebody could swoop in and claim it . Swoop in and claim what ? It 's the treasure of Roaring Dan Seavey . Roaring Da ... Who ? He 's a pirate , a pirate who stole a collection of artifacts from Warehouse 12 . And we are gonna steal them back . During the transition between Warehouse 12 and Warehouse 13 , the HMS Avalon , which was a cargo ship that was laden with artifacts , was besieged off the Atlantic coast by pirates . " Led by Roaring Dan Seavey " these brigands looted the Avalon , absconding with several crates of artifacts " and claiming the life of Agent David Walker . " Oh , man . Killed by a pirate ? That 's how I wanna go out . Ooh ! So whatever happened to Dan Seavey ? Vanished ! For 100 years . No Warehouse agent has ever been able to find him , or the artifacts that he stole . But I have a lead . This is one half of a puzzle box that was actually built by Roaring Dan . I , 18 years ago , borrowed it from the Smithsonian , and I know , when the two halves of the box are put together , it will somehow reveal where his hideout is . Now , when you say borrowed ... And Dan was , was notoriously para ... No ... Paranoid about the location and protecting his stash . So , I 'm assuming that your lead is the other half of that puzzle box . Yes , that 's right . I managed to trace it to a black market dealer in antiquities . And I finally convinced him to let us buy his half . Ha ! One condition . We have to meet this dealer in upstate New York in exactly five hours or the deal is off . Why so small a window ? Well , black market dealers , they tend to be a little skittish . They don 't want to give time for their buyers to bring the authorities . But now , we need to get a move on , and shuffle off to Buffalo . Ah , yes , Buffalo . Birthplace of the hot wing ! Healthiest part of the chicken . Well , well , well . She lives . Mmm . What is all this stuff ? And does it have anything to do with me ? Backlogged mission reports and no . I drew the short straw , but you 're welcome to help . Mmm , pass . Oh , by the way ... Thanks for maxing out my voice , text and data plans , Mr. Cyber Stalker . Well , if I was stalking you , I would have known where you were at 1 : 00 in the morning . I ... Took Nick to a Dead Rent concert . It 's a long drive back from Featherhead , mom . Still , wouldn 't have killed you to call . Okay . You , sir , are in an official snit . What gives ? It 's Nick . What about him ? He 's been here three days and I still haven 't heard an honest word from him . Even a simple question like , " Where are you from ? " He dodges it like a bullet . Ha . A kid from the streets lying to an adult he just met . That never happens . You need to be more careful around him . He 's 15 . And homeless , he 's withdrawn , guarded , mistrustful . Three of my best friends at that age . And I get that you wanna protect him . I do . All I 'm saying is just ... Keep your eyes open . Okay ? And do you think , you could maybe be a little more older brother and less Big Brother ? Mmm-hmm . Okay , deal . Now I must go bathe in caffeine . Hmm . Is everything all right ? I 'm in , aren 't I ? I 'll text you when we 're a go . This one can 't be traced . And don 't forget to floss , dear . Yes , Mother . Can you sense it ? Can you feel it ? We 're this close to solving a historic Warehouse mystery . I don 't know , kind of a strange place to be selling a priceless antiquity . You 're right . We should be looking for a quaint little storefront , " Ye Olde Black Market . " Any idea what this dealer looks like ? No , but when we find him , my name is Mr. Fischer . You got it ? Fischer . Fischer . Fischer . That 's him . It 's on . Agent Jinks , hey , just the guy I want to see . Um , you got a sec ? I 'm kinda busy , Nick . Maybe later ? Next time you feel like calling me a liar , why don 't you just do it to my face ? Okay , so ... Claudia told you about our conversation . It 's just ... 'Cause you 're right . I haven 't been honest with you . And I 'm really sorry . You guys have been like ... Really nice , and I 'm not used to ... People being nice . What I am used to is lying ... Stealing ... Getting beaten up , and not being able to trust another living soul for what feels like ... Five hundred years and ... I 'm just ... I 'm so ... So damn tired of it . All I want is for , like , a normal life . That 's the first honest thing you 've said to me in three days . Oh . Okay . We 're doing this now . Um . I 'm sorry , um ... I 'm sorry that I 've been a pain in the ass . Um ... Can I , like , buy you lunch or something ? My treat . Well ... Claudia gave me the money , but ... Oh , thanks . But I got paperwork . Yeah . Looks like mountains of it . Yeah . Never ends . You 're here for the puzzle box , Mr. Nielsen ? The name is Fischer . I can verify that , Clyde Fischer . Your name is Arthur Nielsen . We know that voice . Pete Lattimer . Myka Bering . Charlotte Dupres . What the hell are you doing here ? I 've come to make a deal . Roaring Dan Seavey 's puzzle box . Exquisite , isn 't it ? But it 's kind of a coincidence that you have it . Don 't you think , Char ? I collect items of historical significance , Mr. Lattimer . And what a storied past lies behind this little beauty . Can we just please move this along ? When we last met , you people broke into my home , you stole from me , and , oh , yes ! You shot me . Which might explain my being cautious . Okay . You started it with the shotgun . Nevertheless , if you want my half , it 's going to cost you . Good , fine . What 's the price ? Oh , no , no , no . I 'm not interested in chump change , Mr. Nielsen . No , no . I have got my eye on a far greater price . What do you want ? Dan Seavey was one of the most successful pirates of his time . His unrecovered fortune would be worth ... Tens of millions today . But you see , I need your half of the puzzle box to get it . We don 't have the puzzle box . Oh , please . It was stolen from the Smithsonian 18 years ago by a man wielding a ray gun . Which at the time sounded positively absurd until you two zapped me with one so ... Thought I 'd put my half up for sale and see if I could smoke you out . Fine . We have half the puzzle box . Our half , not for sale . Hmm , thought as much . But , you see , I would be willing to combine our respective halves and split Dan 's fortune 50-50 . Now you can 't say that 's not fair . Partners ? Can we just ... We 'll just ... Wait , wait , wait , wait ... Give us a second . You 're not seriously considering this , are you ? Yes , I am . She holds the key to the lost artifacts . Those artifacts have stayed lost for 100 years . I know . They will keep for another 100 . No , you don 't understand ... Listen , to me . This woman is clearly a liar . There 's a reason that she has dragged us here to Buffalo . I 'm telling you , the wings are legendary . Put some ranch dressing ... Hey , just ... Just stay cool . Listen to me ... Roaring Dan targeted ships , from the Atlantic to the Great Lakes . Great Lakes . Charlotte must have evidence , that his stash is somewhere in this region . We cannot risk her finding the artifacts without us there . Keep your enemies closer . Yes , don 't worry . She won 't be with us for very long . All right , Miss Dupres . Partners . So ... Where were we ? We were partners . Where the hell have you been ? What ? Artie wouldn 't stop at a single Denny 's . You have it everywhere . Ah . What would I do without you ? Okay . Wait a minute . There is that look again . Myka , what 's , what 's wrong ? On my physical , the doctor found something ... I have cancer . No ! Myka , Myka , Myka , Myka , Myka . Earth to Myka . You keep zoning out on me . What is with you today ? Nothing . No . There 's nothing wrong ... Let 's just ... Stay focused . On the mission . No . Not until you tell me what 's wrong . Pete , just forget it . Pete ! Myka , come here . Look at this . Come here , come here , come here . Look at this . I gotta say , I 'm very excited . What is that ? Combination to Davy Jones ' Locker ? No , I think it 's , uh ... Longitude and latitude . They 're coordinates . Oh . No ! So what , is this puzzle box a one shot deal ? Wait . Tell me you got it ? You have to ask ? Okay , this is about as specific as it gets . It 's somewhere within 100 yards of here . Looks like somebody was a bit too literal about taking his secrets to the grave . It 's a good place to hide a lifetime of plunder . All right . We 're gonna cover more ground if we split up . Charlotte , you two go that way and just shout if you find anything . You do the same . All right . Hey , Artie . Yeah . We 're not gonna have to dig up any dead bodies , are we ? 'Cause I promise you , it only looks cool in the movies . Dan put the coordinates in the puzzle box for a reason . There 's gotta be something here . All right , Pete . You check that way . Yeah . Artie ? What ? Jonathan P. Tann . That was the name of his first mate , right ? Yeah . " Seaman . " Yeah . Please . This headstone is not made of stone . No , this is molded concrete . A more secure puzzle box , perhaps . Auguste Rodin 's sculpting tools . They have the power to reveal shapes hidden inside objects . Hey , how come that bag always has exactly ... Ah-ah-ah-ah ! You 'll jinx it . Uh , it doesn 't look like a treasure . Looks like an electric meter . " NFPC ... " Shh . First we have to lose Charlotte and the giant . What the hell ? Knew I couldn 't trust you . Thank you , Lars , and thank you , Warehouse 13 . Hey , okay . So , which would you prefer ? Sandy beaches or rocky mountains because I just found two kickass youth shelters in Miami ... Whatever . The sooner I get away from your partner the better . What ? Why ? What happened ? Steve and I just got into it , something fierce . That seems ... God , he said he 'd be cool . Well , I guess not . And no matter what I say , that guy 's never gonna believe me . Hey ... Let me handle him , okay ? Come here . Well , that was shocking . Duplicitous minx ! She double-crossed my double cross . Look , we know where she went though , right ? I mean ... " NFPC . " " Niagara Falls Power Company . " Construction began in 1897 . The same period that Roaring Dan was active in this area . I think the stash has got to be buried under here . Ah , an uber-rich loner with a secret underground lair . Right . Like , who is this guy ? Spider-Man ? What ? Oh , my God . No ! Spider-Man lives in Queens with his aunt . Batman ... Pete ! Moderate your Comic-Con panel later . What 's Comic-Con ? Whoa ! You know , I think ... Nikola Tesla designed a lot of this . - Hey , guys . - Yeah . These , these meter thingies , they look just like the one that was in that headstone . You know what ? You 're right . I 'll bet one of these is the key to Dan 's hideout . Guys ... I think Charlotte already found it . Wonder if ... Avast , me hearties ! Let 's go snag us some arrr-tifacts . Yes , indeed . Yeah , just tell him that Steve Jinks called . Thanks . Hey ! I was just about to come looking for you . What 's up ? You know , I think , you and I need to have some serious words about Nick . Sure . But ... Is that alarm coming from your computer ? That sounds like the intruder alert you told me you set up . We gotta get to the Warehouse . If Charlotte got here ahead of us , she could have already found the Warehouse 12 crates . Artie , relax . She 'd probably just mistake them for a bunch ofjunk ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! It 's Lars . He 's dead . That never happens at Comic-Con . I 'm no doctor , but I 'm ... I 'm pretty sure , the human head is not supposed to twist like that . His neck is broken . Well , given the unnatural angle , I would say , his neck was forcibly snapped . He must have died instantly . You know , I think that ... Myka , what 's wrong ? What ? Nothing 's wrong . Look , just judging by the dagger in his hand , I mean , he and Charlotte must have turned on one another . Right ? There 's no blood on the dagger . He never got a chance to use it . Okay . I 'm sorry . All right . Are we saying that Charlotte took out a guy over a foot taller than she is ? Well , look at his body position . He was obviously running up the stairs to get out . Maybe ... Maybe Charlotte found an artifact and used it on him . Yeah . All the more reason for us to snag and bag them before she uses an artifact on us . Who else can the intruder possibly be , if not Nick ? I don 't know but can you wait until we get in there before you start pointing fingers ? Okay . When was the last time you saw him ? Oh , my God . Nick knows nothing about the Warehouse , okay ? Also I 've got this place locked down tighter than Mrs. Frederic 's weave . Only person who gets past my security protocols is me . Okay , but if he could , what would he have to do first to break in ? Cut the power to Artie 's office or something ? Oh , yeah . I mean , technically . Yeah . But if the lights are on out here , chances are they 're still gonna be on in ... This proves nothing . Gotta be a glitch somewhere . Freaky . Everything looks normal . Let there be light . Can you tell if there 's anyone out there ? If there is anything I can 't do , I 'll let you know . FYI , there 's not . Thermal imaging . Yeah , okay . That blue spot is the Dark Vault , a breezy 66 degrees . All good there . The red zone , the Lehmann Fornax , a balmy 120 . There . Oh , the Bronze Sector ? Yes , since everyone there is technically still alive , they radiate faint traces of heat . Right . Where are you going ? Well , up to check the Bronze Sector . With all those heat signatures in flux , it 's a perfect hiding spot . I 'm going with you . No , no , no , no . I need your eyes up here watching my back . Just give me a shout if you see anybody coming my way . Uh ... I seriously doubt it , but take this . This is nuts . Artie , you have to wait , until we can clear the room . Don 't worry , no , we 're fine . Nothing 's going to kill you , Myka . Ah , I know what you 're thinking . You do ? Yeah . Charlotte wacked Lars , so she could keep all of Roaring Dan 's loot for herself . Yeah . You read my mind . Guys , come here . Look at this . Ah . Well , shiver me timbers . Look at this . It looks like Dan tried to replicate the interior of his ship , the Wanderer . Doesn 't look like Charlotte 's been here yet . Well , let 's hope . Think Dan lived here ? Most historians say he died in 1949 , but the truth is he fell off the map decades earlier . Guys ! Check out Bonesy McDead over here . Roaring Dan Seavey , I 'd imagine . It 's him all right . Take a look at this . During the raid on the ship , Avalon , it 's said he lost a couple of fingers . Man scored some serious bling . We 're here for artifacts , not treasure . Look around . You know what ? There 's no point in the three of us searching the same room . I 'm gonna check out the hall . Hey , I 'm running a diagnostic on the Warehouse systems . Claudia , check the thermal imaging in Caretto-0801 . I think there 's somebody behind me , hurry ! Checking right now . Oh , my God ! Jinksy , watch your six . Oh , my God . Oh , my God , no ! Steve , what is it ? Claudia , go . Get the hell out of the Warehouse now ! Why , why ? What 's ... You 're dead . She killed you ! Steve ! Jinksy ! Jinksy ! Marcus . You remember me . That 's good . No ! No ! Children shouldn 't play with guns . How 'd you kill your bodyguard ? I didn 't . We were attacked . By whom ? I don 't know , but we 're not the only ones down here . If Roaring Dan actually tried to replicate the original cabin , these captains , they often had escape hatches down to the cargo hold . So if their ship was under attack they could go down there , grab their plunder and get the hell out . So we look for a hidden passage ? I love hidden passages ! This ... That could have a false bottom . And hide a passageway . Whoo-hoo-hoo ! Man , my timbers are shivering . Did it just get cold in here ? Ah , what 's that ? Holy crap ! Artie ! It 's the noise . The noise , Artie . The noise , the noise , it 's kryptonite , make noise ! Artie , Artie , Artie , Artie ... Are you all right ? Are you all right ? I think so . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . Artie , listen . I found Charlotte . She claims that some sort of smoke monster killed her bodyguard . Yeah , it just tied to kill me , too . I know , right ? She 's ... Wait , what ? I 'll explain later . Just get here now , hurry ! Oh ! Twenty miles of Warehouse . I find the one dead end . Oh , wrong turn ? Oh ! I killed you , you can 't be here . Yet , here I am . What did you do with Steve ? I replaced his ghostly pallor with a nice bronze glow . You bronzed him ? Why ? What the hell do you want ? Hmm . Nice try . No , the dagger wasn 't a weapon . It was treasure that he picked up . Exactly , treasure . Exactly the same as when I moved these coins . That 's when it came again . But it was like a really angry shadow . Exactly . A shadow that protects treasure , doesn 't that seem , I don 't know , strange to you ? Artie ! Yes . That thing , it went down under the carpet , into the floor . Now , if its job is to guard Dan 's stash ... Then there could be a hatch . Okay ... Okay , you know what ... There 's gotta be some kinda mechanism that unlocks this thing . Go , look for a switch . Hey , guys , check it out . Look alive , ye scurvy dogs ! There be stormy seas ahead ! Why do you always ... Found the switch . Hang on , Jinksy . Artie 's stupid spit locks . Come on , come on , come on , come on . Yes , prepare to be bypassed . You all right there , Artie ? Oh , I 'm fine . The floor broke my fall . Oh , my God ! This is it , Dan 's fortune . Oh , my God , Artie , you did it . We found it . No ! We , we , we , we did it . Finally , the Warehouse 12 missing artifacts . Wait , wait , first ... First we have to find the artifact that is causing that smoke thing killer to come ... Right , and bag it before tall , dark , and neck snappy shows up . Copy that . Yeah . Artie , how are we supposed to find the artifact that 's causing this , if we are not supposed to touch anything ? No , I know , look at the outside of the crates . They all have , they all have ... Look , they have manifests . Just check those out , maybe one of them will have a clue . I 'm not seeing anything that says , " Causes murderous smoke monster , " on any of these labels . How about you , Mykes ? Me neither , but , look , it 's gotta be here somewhere , so just keep looking . What the hell are you doing ? I didn 't do anything . Ah ! Her . Oh ! Nothing . Just checking my emails . This was never about Dan 's treasure ... Was it , Charlotte ? This has always been about the artifacts . Artifacts , what artifacts ? The artifacts that you knew somehow were down here . That you used us to find . What are you talking about ? I was only ever here for the treasure . No , no , no , no ! Oh ! Make noise , make noise , that 's what 's gonna scare it . It doesn 't like noise . It 's not working . Oh , my God , she 's ... Dead . So I take it back . Being killed by a pirate is a crappy way to die . Really ? Is there a good way ? What 's with her ? I don 't know . Something is ... So I guess sound isn 't what chased off old Slim Shady after all . But , what made him run ? I don 't know . I think it 's maybe just a question of pitch . Or maybe it 's the composition of the brass . I think we need the bell . What the hell was that , Artie ? The smoke , I don 't know , but for everything I 've seen ... I think it 's some kind of psychic extension or projection . Projection of who ? Roaring Dan Seavey . When that smoke monster thing was choking Charlotte , I noticed that it only had three fingers on one had . Just like the skeleton upstairs . So even from the grave Dan 's keeping an eye on his booty . Now all we need to do is find out what artifact he used . All right , just keep looking at the manifests . Carefully ! Because we don 't wanna touch anything . I got Thaddeus Cahill 's Telharmonium keyboard which causes synesthesia . No ! Uh , Robert the Bruce 's tartan . Inspires unyielding defiance ? Guys . This box is empty . Huh ? " One jewel-studded , unicursal hexagram " amulet belonging to Aleister Crowley . " Aleister Crowley , the guy from the Ozzy song ? Oh , yes . Yes , you 're right , actually . Aleister Crowley . He was a notorious occultist who spent much of his life studying and mastering the art of astral projection . Which he considered essential in the quest for the discovery of one 's true will . So Dan 's one true will is protecting his treasure after his death . And , and he was a frustrated tenor . Who could never hit High C ! What ? The bell , that was a perfect High C ! Oh , come on . Tell me you could hear that . What bell ? All right , so Crowley 's amulet allowed our favorite pirate to project . But where is it ? So , it was an amulet that was a hexagram . A hexagram ... Is a six-pointed star , so ... Oh , my God . Oh , my God , in the skeleton 's hand upstairs , there was a hexagram ! You know how a ladder works , right ? Yes . Ah , there is no limit to my genius . Yes . Ah ! What the ... Hello , unusual and out of place . What ... Come here . Can you just tell him that Steve Jinks called ? Hey ! I was just about to come looking for you . Is that alarm coming from your computer ? That sounds like the intruder alert you told me you set up . Okay , but if he could , what would he have to do first to break in ? Cut the power to Artie 's office or something ? Technically , yeah ! You know , but if the lights are on out here , chances are they 're still on in there . Since everyone there is technically still alive , they all radiate faint traces of heat . With all those heat signatures in flux it 's a perfect hiding spot . Well , Jinksy ... It turns out you were ... Who the hell are you ? Jinksy , thank God , you 're still there . Uh , where else would I be ? I gotta get these mission logs done before Artie gets back . Yeah , I knew that we were backlogged , but this is gonna take weeks . Oh , yeah , you 've been whammied , too . Check your pockets . Okay . What 's this ? Just bag it . Hurry ! Uh ... Claud , are you gonna fill me in ? Franz Mesmer 's magnets . They create illusion through the power of suggestion . I 'll give you one guess who slipped ' em to us . Nick ? Oh , thanks . But I got paperwork . Looks like mountains of it . Looks like mountains of it . Yeah . He used them , to make me think that he was you . And then he used me . Steve , I trusted him , I let him into our home and ... I mean , you warned me , God ! But I ... You did what you thought was right . Now that little pissant 's loose in the Warehouse . What 's he after ? A Bronze Sector prisoner . Some geezer named ... Spoilers . Claudia ! Don 't ! How long have you known about the Warehouse ? You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . I am way past believing anything you have to say . Look , I wish that I didn 't have to lie to you . But you 'll understand later . You 're making a big mistake , Nick . And there 's a reason that guy was bronzed , whoever he is , he 's dangerous . I know . But I need him . I 'm sorry , Claudia . Okay , okay , now listen . As soon as I touch this amulet , Pete , the bell , Myka , bag , you got it ? Ready . Okay . Bag , Myka ! Artie ! How do I stop it , Myka ? What do I do ? Tell me quickly . Put that amulet in the bag . Oh ! Okay ! Not dead . Wow . I imagine she gets that a lot . At least once every 100 years . Allow me to reintroduce myself . I am the Countess of St. Germain . Sutton 's wife . Who 's Sutton ? He was the Count , who died in Paris . I had no idea that thing was even down there . Get in , get out , that was the plan . In our business things almost never go as planned . Wait . Oh ! So in Paris , Sutton . The ... Little weasel . He ... He faked his own death too , didn 't he ? It comes in handy when things get dodgy . It 's easier to ... To disappear when everybody thinks you 're dead . But you didn 't . You came back and you saved us . Why ? I 've dealt with agents , since the Ottoman Empire hosted the Warehouse in 1561 . Alexi from Warehouse 11 killed me twice . But you three ... You , you were the first ones that risked your own life to save mine . It seems that even the Warehouse has evolved . Oh , wait , wait , wait , not so fast , Countess . You may have misjudged us , but the jury is still out on you . What were you looking for in that Warehouse 12 crate ? The Philosopher 's Stone ! From Harry Potter . From the Magnum Opus . It 's said that stone can turn base metal into gold . Among other things . Sutton said that a stone kept him from aging . Not just him . Clearly . And now you 've got ... Do you mind ? Oh , just half the stone . Where 's the other half ? I don 't know , but I need to find it . Uh-huh , and then what ? Unlimited power ? Power ? No ! Then what do you want ? Just to be like you , like everyone else . I want to be mortal . You want to give up immortality ? Wait a minute ... Are you crazy ? I mean who wouldn 't wanna live forever ? You might get to see the Browns win a Super Bowl . The things you 've seen , imagine . What you will see , imagine , what you could accomplish ... Yes , yes , but now imagine everyone you have ever known , or will know , dying . Imagine never allowing yourself to get close to somebody because , they don 't understand . " Why don 't you age ? " Imagine the loneliness and the solitude . And the isolation . And then , imagine watching your only child go through that forever . That 's why we had to try to get into the ... Had to go into ... Only child . Nick . Oh , my God . Nick is your son . He 's been 15 for ... Over 500 years ... Immortality is his prison . I 've spent centuries trying to release him from it . My son deserves a real life . He deserves to fall in love with somebody , to grow old with somebody , to ... To die . He 'll die . You know that , right ? Because that 's what us , we mere mortals do . We die . And sometimes it 's not pretty . It 's ugly and it 's messy and it 's painful . Myka , what was that ? It 's nothing . No ! No . We 've been friends way too long . Cards on the table . I have cancer . Is that it ? I mean ... You 're not gonna yell or ... Cry ... Claudia ! Why is Nick at the BB ? We wanted something from you , something I wasn 't sure that you 'd give . Yeah ! Artie , you guys need to get back here right now . Nick broke into the Warehouse and released one of the Bronze Sector prisoners ... A guy named Paracelsus . The alchemist . Yeah , well , he was bronzed for a reason , probably a good one . Where are they now ? Gone ! Gone ? No , no , that 's not the plan . Nick said they 'd wait . He would 've told me if things had changed . Artie , he destroyed the bronzer . And look ... He bronzed Claudia . What did you do ?

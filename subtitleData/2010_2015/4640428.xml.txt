It 's like he believes Bradford , but not us . I don 't know , man . Maybe I embarrass him . Ever since my mom passed away , he 's just been different . Dude , it 's been , like , five years . Yeah . Well , it seems like no matter what I do , I just can 't do anything right , so ... Well , then maybe you should just join the police academy or something , bro . What ? Look , bro , I 'm sure he loves you in his own weird way . And it 's got to be hard to be a father of an obnoxious punk like you . - ( laughs ) - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - Still nothing ? - No . I don 't get it , bro . I sent JP , like , 10 texts . He always gets back to me . And Captain Sallie said he never came back to the bar . Yo , maybe his phone just got wet . - Something happened to him . - No . No way , all right ? I was on the swim team with that little dude . He could do the broadstroke better than anyone . - ( Tone sounds ) - Yo . It 's JP 's brother . He said he hasn 't heard from him either . I think he 's gone , guys . Man on radio : Harbor Patrol Two . Nothing so far , Chief . We 'll keep a sharp eye out . He 's a small guy , might be hard to spot . Moretti : Roger that . Right on time . Where you 're standing will be the fairway to the 18th hole with a 180-degree view of the Atlantic Ocean . You promised me progress . We 've had our setbacks , but everything is on target . Those pylons aren 't even cemented in yet . What 's the holdup , the union ? Well , we had a minor town hall ordinance issue , but believe me when I tell you everything has been resolved . I 've heard that story . I have a shareholders meeting Tuesday . I need to show my investors something . I feel an ultimatum coming on . You must be psychic . Those pylons must be cemented in by the fourth , which is tomorrow , or I 'm pulling your funding . Don 't worry about it . Believe me , it will happen . Sir , I don 't know what happened last night , but the main power line went out . We 're a bit behind , but we 're going to try to fix it . We 'll catch up , all right ? You know , when I get behind , I get unhappy , and the last guy like you to make me unhappy couldn 't get a job around here for a couple of years . He had to get that little government card to get his groceries , his daughter had to drop out of college , the whole ball of wax . So the last thing I would do if I were you is to make me unhappy . Hello ? Hello ? All right , spark it up . Double the drilling time . Boss ' orders . Are you kidding me , Richie ? We 're already over the limit here . Hey , they got a problem downtown , let them deal with it . We do what we 're told . Whatever you say . Fire this baby up . ( Rumbling ) ( thumping ) Radio : The search for missing Seaside Heights resident John Pelligrino has been called off . Authorities report Pelligrino is presumed drowned , although no body has been found . To our boy , JP . Rest in peace , little guy . All : JP . ( Door opens ) Those dudes are dead . Nooki . We heard about JP . I 'm sorry . Yo , that bastard Bradford . I say we set his house on fire . Yeah , after we waterboard the preppy 's strunes . Guys , relax . As much as I want to blame Bradford for this , it wasn 't all his fault . - So you 're saying he drownded ? - Paulie : Yo , forget that . JP was the best swimmer I know . I 've never seen a pair of little legs kick faster than that . Paulie 's right . He definitely didn 't drownded . Something did this . You mean like he was attacked by something ? - Like what ? - I don 't know . Like that stingray that killed the British guy . You know , the one that hunted the crocodillies . - Mmmmm . - TC : No . - Like a shark . - ( gasps ) Sharks aren 't that uncommon down the shore . Come on , TC , this ain 't Florida . You 're talking fantasyland here . Does this look like fantasyland to you ? All right . So what are we going to do ? I got an idea . Come on . Anyways , did you see Monique the other day ? Yo , TC , what are we doing ? Oh , are we going to have a vigil , bro ? - Something like that . - ( laughs ) Aw , that 's what I 'm talking about . - Boom , baby . - Yeah , babe . Yes . Where did you get these , dude ? - Don 't worry about it . - Blockbusters . Borders . - Guns . - Ammo . Yeah , kid . - All right , come on . - Nice . Let 's go , babe . What didn 't you understand on the Ferris wheel ? The part where I said I never want to see you again , or the part where I said I was going to cut your nuts off and set them on fire ? Neither . No . This is a really bad idea . This is for JP . Let 's go . Let 's go . We are going to be in so much trouble if we get caught . Hey , we ain 't going to get caught , all right ? Hey , guys , check it out . Yo , what 's a boat doing out here ? Guys , why is it covered in blood ? Ah , it 's probably just spaghetti sauce . What ? My father never went fishing without some spuntini . - Hey , isn 't that Vinny 's stuff ? - Which Vinny ? - Vinny No-Neck ? - No , bro . Vinny Bananas . Bananas is in Florida , bro . - No , I mean Vinny Knuckles . - Knuckles is dead . That must be Vinny Bumbaza 's boat . Hey , stunads , it 's Vinny Crabs . - Mmm . - That 's him . Okay . So if this is his boat ... where 's Vinny ? Oh ! Guys , check it out . There 's something in the water . On , boy . Nooki : God , what is it ? I don 't know . ( Screaming ) Stay clear ! Shush . Oh , God . What are you freaking doing ? We can 't leave Vinny bobbing around like this . We got to give him a proper burial . Seriously ? They 're just going to cremate him and sprinkle his ashes in the sea . We saved ' em a bunch of steps . J-Moni : You guys are insane . What if they don 't cremate him ? What if they want to bury him regular-like ? Like , you know , get him one of those ... in a coffin . Bro , you can 't put that in a coffin . It 's going to look ridiculous . - Shark ! - ( screaming ) Whoa ! They 're everywhere ! Donnie , toss the chum . Donnie , you did bring the chum , didn 't you ? - I brought protein , bro . - Don 't you dare . Not that kind of protein . I got to save that for the ladies . - Come on . - Are you kidding ? What ? I never leave home without ' em . You really think you 're gonna attract sharks with protein bars ? Nothing 's going to resist 25 grams of power-packed peanut-butter crunch . All right . All right , it 's show time . - Fireworks . - Come on . Let 's do it , baby ! Get going ! - Hurry up ! - Fire in the hole ! Die , you son of a bitch ! ( Fireworks whistle ) I 've got it . Here you go . Hurry up ! They 're everywhere ! - Hurry up . - Yeah , man , hurry up ! - ( Sobbing ) - Yo , fire in the hole . Yeah ! - Whoa ! - ( screams ) - Whoa ! - BJ ! 'BJ ! ' ( " reaming ) - Come on ! - Right behind you ! ( Sobbing ) - Nooki ! - Come on ! OMG ! - Give me your hand ! - Come on ! BJ ! - Get her up . - Go get the borders ! - Get the borders ! - Kill it ! Kill that thing ! - I hate stupid sharks . - Here ! - ( Explosion ) - ( screaming ) ( Nooki sobbing ) I 'm gonna throw up . Guys , they 're getting away . Good ! Let ' em ! You know what ? You guys , you do what you want , but I 'm going after ' em . Oh , haven 't we done enough , TC ? One of those things killed JP and I 'm not letting ' em get away with it . How do you suggest we stop ' em , bro ' ? We need a boat . Right here , guys . This is the one . All right . Don 't worry . I 'll get it started up . - Oh , my God . - Ladies . Thank you . Why is there a picture of Bradford and his skank-ass girlfriend on this boat ? 'Cause it 's his boat . - It 's what ? - It 's what ? Why are you trying to steal Bradford 's boat ? Because he 's a douche . - Need I pontificate ? - Oh , my God . Guys , can we please hurry up ? The sharks are gonna get away . J-Moni : Where did you learn how to do that ? Where I learn everything ... YouTube . You ever drove one of these things ? Hell , no , but I rocked the hell out of " Grand Theft Auto " on PS3 . - How different can it be , huh ? - My God . We 're going to die . - Hey , listen . - Yeah ? - This isn 't a game . Move over . - Come on , TC , just let me drive . Does anybody smell gas ? I smell gas . Guys . Guys . Guys ! I can do it . I do know what I 'm doing ! There 's a shark coming ! Move over . - Come on , just let me drive . - Just move this over . I got it . BJ : Donnie , I just told you I smell gas ! - Ah ! OW ! ' ( Screaming ) Get off the boat ! - ( Fireworks whistling ) - Get off the boat ! - Oh , my God ! ' ( Screaming ) ( fireworks popping ) - It 's going to blow ! - Go ! Go ! - Get off ! - Come on . Go ! Go ! It 's going to blow ! ( Siren blaring ) Looks like things just got complicated . I 'm starving . You guys hungry ? Thanks . Hey , Mr. Moretti , you have any gabagool or soup or salad around here ? I 'm dying . Or something ? - What 's the matter with you ? - What ? Handcuffs ? Really , Pop ? You blew up a boat . That 's malicious destruction , arson . I told you it was an accident . Don 't give me any lip , Tino . Look , you 're all pazzo because you lost a friend . I get it , but that 's no excuse to break the law . There 's more to it than that . This isn 't some bocce ball game you 're playing here , Tino . This is your life we 're talking about . You 're not listening to me . JP didn 't drown . He was killed by a shark . And there 's a whole bunch of them out there . They 're not like regular sharks , Dad . They got this white skin and these red eyes and these huge fins . One of them killed Vinny . - Vinny No-Neck ? - Vinny Crabs . White skin , red eyes ? That 's a mighty tall tale , Tino . I 'm telling you the truth , Pops . Vinny 's boat is out there by the breakwater . Check it out . This is Moretti calling Harbor Patrol . Come in , Harbor Patrol . Man : I read you , Chief . Have you seen anything of Vinny Crabs today ? He 's probably fishing out by the breakwater . That 's a negative . Anybody file a missing person report on him ? That 's also a negative . 10-4 . You hear that ? Nothing . Zero . So what do we do now ? Now ? Now I go pay a visit to Mr. Dolan . And I have to ask him very nicely not to press charges against my son and his cugini . Next time you blow up a boat , make sure you check the registration . Because the boat you blew up belongs to Mr. Dolan . The Mr. Walter Dolan who has the power to see that you spend time behind bars for this . Is that what you want , Tino ? I want you to believe me . Well , what did he say ? Says he 's going to take us for pizza and beer . What do you think he said ? T , we got to do something , bro . Don 't worry about it . This ain 't over . - ( thumps ) - ( gasps ) Hey ! - Where did he go ? - I don 't know . Ryan . Look . Ryan : What the ... ? ( Both scream ) - ( gasping ) - ( girl screaming ) R ! / an ! It 's going to rival the Hamptons . I 'm going to turn the Jersey Shore into a vacation Mecca of luxurious relaxation and entertainment , and it all begins with the Beach Club . It 's nice . But some people like things the way they are around here , Walter . You got 10 miles of beautiful , white , sandy beaches , blue sky , and what does this town have to show for it ? Wet T-shirt contests and funnel cake . You have to make Seaside Heights live up to its potential . Yeah , sounds a little bit like gentrification to me . It 's beautification . - Really ? - You should be happy . I 'm going to make your job a hell of a lot easier . Less crime and a better class of people . Walter , I think I can handle a few kids blowing off some steam . And , please , let 's not forget some of those same kids ' families helped build this town to what it is today . It 's not the kids . It 's what they represent . What they represent ? We call that culture around here . Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you wanted culture . I 'll get you all the art galleries and all the music centers that you want . Do you really want more hoodlums , more bar fights , - more ... - Italians ? I was going to say thieves . Like the ones who destroy people 's boats . And that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Walter , my ... my son is going through a tough time right now . Yes . That poor midget guy drowned . That was a terrible thing . And I hear they were trespassing on my property . Okay . From one father to another , I need to ask you not to press charges against them . ( sighs ) There 's an old saying , you know ? One hand washes the other . Radio : Keep your radio dial on The Sound of the Shore , rocking your Fourth of July party all week long . ( Dance music playing ) Let me get it to you in about an hour . That work ? Yo , you really think they 're going to listen to us , bro ? We got to spread the word . This is our best option . Excuse me . Can I help you guys ? Look , we need somebody to get on the radio and warn people to stay out of the water . And why would I do that ? - Sharks , my dude . - Yeah , bad-ass sharks , bro . We were out on the breakwater and there 's a whole bunch of ' em . And people are dead . So I 'm supposed to just take your word for this ? Okay , tell you what . Let me call the police , see what they say . Yo , we just talked to the police . We were just there . Let me guess . They don 't believe you guys . Please , you got to believe us , all right ? Just go on the air and let people know what 's going on . Look , I 'm sorry , guys , but I can 't go on with this unless I talk to the authorities . Nothing I can do . If you 'll excuse me , I have to be back on the air . Thank you . - Well , that went great . - Shut up . All right , who else should we warn ? Well , we got the marina , the senior center . Are you stupid ? Old people don 't swim , bro . They play shuffleboard . Well , then what about the Yacht Club ? They got a private beach , don 't they ? Are you serious , bro ? They 're never gonna believe us . No , we got to at least try . It 's the right thing to do . Come on . Well , if it isn 't the pepperoni brothers . I hope you guys are here to deliver a pizza . If not , I 'm going to have to call security . You know , you got this vein on your forehead that looks like it 's just about ready to pop . You blew up my boy 's boat . It was an accident . Listen , we just want to talk to you , all right ? Make it quick ... Balzac . You got to shut the club 's beach down now . What , are you guys funny ? Some kind of joke ? This isn 't a joke . These waters are infested with albino sharks . Sharks ? Yeah , like killer sharks , bro . One of them killed JP . Okay , I realize that your brain cells are a little messed up from all the hair gel , so I 'm going to speak really slowly . Johnny ... Pelligrino ... drowned . - I 'm going to knock this kid out . - Chill . Chill . Chill . I 'm scared . Why don 't you guys make yourself useful ? Go bake me a calzone , extra cheese , hold the black olives . You 're going to be sorry . You 're still here . I 'm already sorry . Come on . Joey Fatone 's about to go on . I got an idea . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . Sharks . ( Music playing ) Reporter : I 'm here at the Jersey Shore where Joey Fatone , formerly of ' NSYNC , is about to perform . I 'm very excited . ( Cheering ) ( chuckles ) You call this a venue ? I mean , when I asked you to book me something , like , on a boardwalk , I meant Atlantic City , not Seaside Heights . This is embarrassing . Justin wouldn 't put up with this . Thank goodness . Joey Fatone . Can we talk to you for a minute ? Listen , I don 't do autographs before my performance , okay ? No , we don 't want your autograph . Why not ? We need you to make some kind of warning over the mic , let people know what 's going on . There are white-finned killer albino sharks out there . Excuse me ? ( laughs ) Wait . White-finned killer albino sharks ? - Yeah . - That 's a good one . Where did you get these guys ? Did you hired them ? You guys are like the ... oh , never mind . I got to go . Yo , Fatone , we 're serious ! Joey , my mother loves you . Announcer : Ladies and gentlemen , Joey Fatone . ( Cheering ) All right , welcome , ladies and gentlemen . It 's so great to be here at Seaside ... Heights . Yeah . All right , ladies , this one 's for you . ( Pop music playing ) ( cheering ) Joey ! - ( Microphone feedback ) - ( screaming ) Whoa ! Joey Fatone just got eaten by a shark . Reporter : Folks , you 're not going to believe this . Joey Fatone , formerly of ' NSYNC , has just been eaten by a shark . Everyone we spoke to was shaken by the events . I 've lived on this beach my whole life . I 've never seen anything like it . It was terrible . It came out of nowhere . A shark on the Jersey frigging Shore . Like Moby Dick , but with a fin . Right now , the water is full of fishermen all trying to catch the shark that killed legend Joey Fatone . TC : I know what we saw . It grabbed him right out of the water . We got to do something , but no one 's listening . You want to talk about sharks , I 'll tell you about sharks that 'll make your pubes stand up straight like the first time you saw a naked booty . Wait . You seen ' em , too ? Back in 1916 , my grandfather worked on the boardwalk when it was first being built . Lots of construction . A big undertaking at the time . It was a deadly heat wave that summer . One day , this man , Van-something , - took a swim with his mutt . - ( dog barking ) He was throwing this ball , watching his dog get all excited and fetching , when , all of a sudden , people said he started screaming and flailing his arms . ( Man screaming faintly ) At first , they thought he was joking around , but then he started moving ... pshew ... like a rocket , back and forth . He was being attacked . The next time he brought up his arms , there was only one there . He was being attacked by bull sharks . A whole school of them settled right in off the boardwalk . It was known as the Jersey Shore shark attack . So the night they completed construction on the boardwalk , my Grandpa Sallie and a group of his paisans went out to try to catch one of those fricking things . So they figured they could make a couple of fazools letting people take pictures next to it . So they go out to sea on this little dinghy , armed with fish heads and some pecorino romano to lure these bastards in . And they waited . And they waited so long . Not to mention after a few bottles of grappa , they fell asleep on the boat . Passed out cold for a good hour . Now , sharks rely on vibrations to hunt . Just so happens my Grandpa Sallie 's what my nona called " russare come una mucca . " What 's that mean ? " Snores like a cow . " Wait a minute , Sallie . Cows snore ? The shark was able to track them from the vibrations of his snore . And in an all-out attack , the shark rammed my grandpa 's boat so it knocked him right in the water . - ( Splashes ) - What did your grandpa do ? He only had a minute . This big-ass shark was coming straight for him . He took aim with his harpoon and , bada-bing , - shot him through his left eye . - Why the left ? Because that 's the eye of the devil . There it is , in perfect condition . That 's hard-core , yo . Wait a second . You said that back in the day , they were building the boardwalk , right ? Now , you also said that sharks are attracted to vibrations . There you go . What are you talking about , bro ? I 'm saying the reason why you never seen an albino shark is because they probably live way out in the middle of the ocean , maybe even on the bottom of the ocean floor . There 's no way they would make it out to the Jersey Shore unless they were being attracted by something , just like the last time . The vibrations from Dolan 's drilling . But now it 's worse . Bigger construction ... bigger sharks . GUYS ! Guys ! Hey , you guys better come with me . Baby , what is it ? It 's Nooki . She 's acting like a real frigging wackadoo . Thank you , Sallie . We gotta bounce . Yeah , thanks , Sallie . Really interesting . ( Dance music playing ) ( men cheering ) I have had it with this place . She just had 15 Jell-O shots . Freaking disgrazia , bro . Hey , everybody , pizza 's here . ( Chuckles ) Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Let her do her thing , bro . Just back off , scumbag , okay ? That 's hilarious , The Constipation calling me a scumbag . Shouldn 't you be in jail for blowing up my boat ? Oh , right , right . I forgot . Your cop daddy bailed your loser ass out once again . You 're right . Thank you . - Nooki , come on . - Dance . Hey , you should at least let her finish the show . I got a lap dance coming to me . - Oh ! ' Dude , he freaking jacked him , bro . - Let 's go . - Okay . I just want to dance . Your time is up , guys . This whole place is about to change . What the hell 's the matter with you ? What 's with the bug up your ass ? I was just trying to have some fun . Yeah ? You 're having fun ? Well , you 're acting like a tramp . ( Chuckles ) Oh , please . What do you care , anyways ? Where 's De 'Angela ? Swimming in her skank tank ? I told you I don 't remember what happened that night . Yeah , but I don 't believe you . You are a lying sack of steaming ugatz . That 's all you are . Whatever . Whatever . This guy over here . - Nooki , no . - Honey . You want to dance with me ? - Let 's go . - Yes . - Oh , my God . - Let 's go dance to the car . Yeah . ♪ We 'll dance till our hearts feel light ♪ ♪ We 've got to go all the way I ♪ And make them all want to play . ♪ As you can see , there 's no need to panic . The shark that killed Joey Fatone has been caught . And who are you ? I 'm a marine biologist . And this shark is a carcharhinus leucas albus . It 's an albino deepwater bull shark . And you believe this is the same shark that killed Mr. Fatone ? First of all , this albino bull shark is extremely rare . Because it usually lives at depths up to 2,200 feet , it 's rarely seen within 50 miles of the shore . There 's probably been less than 10 sightings of the carcharhinus leucas albus on record . Therefore , mathematically , it 's highly likely that this is the exact shark that killed Mr. Fatone . Prove it . Why don 't you stick your frigging hand up its throat and check ? ( Cameras clicking ) ( pops ) ( crowd gasps ) On behalf of Dolan Industries , I would like to present these very brave gentlemen with a check for $ 20,000 for protecting the residents of Seaside Heights on this Fourth of July holiday . ( Applause ) Thank you very much , Walter Dolan . Patrick , can I talk to you for a minute ? I 'm in the middle of ... In private , please . I 'll be right back . You want to tell me why you 're opening the beaches ? Apparently you 're not up on current events . Look over there . The danger 's over . Why , because you caught one shark ? No , because we caught the one shark that killed Joey Fatone . Oh , right . So you think that 's the only shark out there ? Nick , there have been sharks berthed out here for generations . We never had a problem . Maybe a few surfers nipped here and there . Patrick , listen to me . We are not talking about some accidental surfing attack here . We 're talking about that shark . It jumped out of the water , grabbed Joey Fatone , and went back into the water . That 's an intentional , vicious kill . That is a one-time freaking accident . My office has received several missing persons reports . That makes me afraid that there 's more sharks out there like that one . My son said he saw several yesterday , and I should have listened to him . Look , I recommend a rollout , strong postings up and down all of the beaches , every entrance and exit around the boardwalk . Are you out of your mind ? People drown here every holiday weekend . Kids get liquored up and go swimming . It 's tragic . But do you really expect me to close everything down on the Fourth of July weekend and create a panic ? Do you know what kind of chaos that will bring ? Do you know what that will do to business ? Patrick , you 're not listening to me about these sharks . Do I have to remind you that your son was arrested yesterday on the marina , okay , city property ? I could press charges . The bottom line is this . The emergency is over . The shark is dead , okay ? Case closed . Capisce , Mr. Italian ? - Sure . - Thank you . Excuse me . Reporter : Now that the shark that killed Joey Fatone has been caught , the beaches are open and people are ready to put this horrible tragedy behind them . You take a look at that seismic report ? What about it ? I think we 're pushing a little too hard . Oh , now you think we pushed a little too hard . Yesterday you tell me to triple the RPMs . Now you think we pushed too hard . Look , don 't sweat it . Tomorrow they 're cementing the pylons . The only thing you have to worry about is where to spend that big bonus . Ah , the old lady wants to go into the city to see " Phantom . " - Again . - " Phantom . " Not me , man . I 'm going to Vegas . What is that ? - Nothing . - What do you mean nothing ? Right there . You don 't see that ? What is that ? It 's probably bluefish . Who cares ? It 's the Fourth of July and I got a barbecue to get to . - Come on . - Richie , I 'm telling you there 's something in the water right there . Hey , I 'm going to check it out before the drill . Mike , where you going ? I 'm telling you , Richie , something 's down there . I 'm going to check it out . I 'll check the drill later . ( air hisses ) Mike . Mike . What , are you bobbing for apples ? Come on . Get your gear . Let 's get out of here . I 'm starving . All right , I 'm coming . I 'm coming . What 's your rush ? Come on , Mike . Mike , stop messing around . What the ... ? - Mike ! - Richie ! - Mike ! Mike ! - Something 's got me , Rich ! - Mike ! Mike ! - Pull me out ! Ow ! Ow ! Mike ! Mike ! ( Screams ) ( electricity crackling ) ( thumping ) Yo , what 's the deal with you and Nooki , bro ? Either you 're totally into each other , or she 's giving Bradford a lap dance . What 's up with that ? I mean , you guys been , what , off and on for over a year now ? Yeah . I screwed up , Donnie . So what ? - All right . - You think ? I 'm just at the club hanging out , and De 'Angela comes up . She starts rubbing up against me . I mean , what am I supposed to do ? I think you should let Nooki know how you feel , that 's all . Yeah , she 's maybe putting on the drama queen act , bro . But I 'm telling you , that meatball 's totally crazy about you . - Yeah , right . - Well , so then get over it . Either say you 're sorry or go hook up with someone new . Oh , I don 't think he wants to do that , Paulie . Wait . Do you ? Look , you morons , we got enough problems with those sharks out there . I don 't need any more . - Now , are we pumped ? - Yeah . - Are you guys ready ? - Yeah . Well , we got work to do , so come on . Come on , let 's go . ( Screaming ) We 're taking the yacht out to the Cove later this afternoon . Full bar , rocking music . Come on . What do you say ? Dock number 's on the back . This is Shore Air One . All clear . This is Harbor Two . Nothing here . Copy that . ( Helicopter whirring ) - Fins . Look for fins . - I know what to look for . I know what to look for . ( ringtone plays ) Yo , Complication . - Anything ? - No , nothing . But we 're looking . I 'll holler at you if we see anything . - TC , I really need to talk to you . - Not now , De 'Angela . Look , about the other night , we didn 't do anything . I mean , I wanted to , but you passed out , and I slept on your bed . That 's it . I 'm sorry . Really ? Hey , De 'Angela . Hey , come on , let 's go . Later , TC . ' ( Spanks ) ' ( giggles ) He knew De 'Angela and I went to high school together . How could he do that ? Look , I don 't mean any offense , but these guidos , they got no potential . No kidding . I feel such a tool . I always fall for guys like that , you know ? 'Cause I 'm attracted to the muscles , the tight abs . Don 't even get me started with the hair . - There 's a lot more to it than that . - I know . You need a guy who 's gonna take care of you . Ain 't that the truth . What are you doing later today ? Why ? A couple of my friends and I are taking my stepfa ... my yacht out to the Cove . Should be a good time . You should come with us . Ain 't there some kind of rule against that sort of thing ? For a beautiful girl like you , rules are meant to be broken . ( slurps ) - Hey , hey , hold on . - Looks good . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey . Listen , sweetheart , I know you want to cool off those hot honkers , but you should stay out of the water . Wow . - They 're amazingly real-like . - Pig ! - Wow . - What did I do ? - The worst . - What ? You better get on your game . All right . Get on up there . Girls , just leave your bags and purses and stuff down in the cabin , all right ? Not bad , right ? I think it will do . Are you sure this is a good idea ? What are you talking about ? Going to the Cove with sharks in the water ? This is something we 've been planning . Do you know how much ass I had to kiss to get my stepfather to let us use this yacht ? I don 't know , man . Even if there are 1,000 sharks out there , this thing 's a tank , pal . Nothing can touch us . Besides ... I got a special guest coming . Is this a joke ? What 's the guido expression ? DTF ? I get it . You 're going to hell , buddy . Oh , it 's way too late for me . This is your boat ? Yeah . You ... look incredible . I know . Hey , why don 't you go on UP ? - Okay . - Make yourself comfortable . Help yourself to some champagne . - Let me help you . - Okay .

I can 't even take a shower . Pound it . Explode it . Rain it down . Good job , guys - Thank God . You guys are okay . Where the hell 's Nooki ? Where is she ? She just texted me . She 's at the Cove . - The cove ? - Yeah . She 's with Bradford on his yacht . - She 's with Bradford ? - Yeah . - On a boat ? - With those things out there ? Go ahead .

( Hip-hop music playing ) This looks good . Drop anchor . Aye , aye , captain . ( Bass thumping ) - Hi . - Hi . You know , some of the girls are going to go skinny-dipping . Yeah , not this meatball . This is how we do it . The best food , best drink , best everything . - I can 't . - Of course you can . I should work on my tan . Can 't let this good sun go to waste . Allow me . Thanks , but I can manage myself . It 's ' cause of TC , isn 't it ? He can 't give you half the things I can . You want new shoes for every day of the year ? Done . New clothes ? Done . All you have to do is ask . TC needs two-for-one coupons to buy a pizza . Why are you Waspy guys so materialistic ? We own all the material . ( Scoffs ) Whatever . Hey , you should join me up on the sundeck . - Clothing optional . - Yeah , I 'll pass . Hey , buddy , you got a problem . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Penelope . We get into one little fight , and you go slumming it with a guidette ? What are you talking about ? What guidette ? I guess that would be me . Why don 't you invite her to join us up on the sundeck ? Clothing optional . Isn 't that what you said ? I was ... I was just kidding around . What 's the matter ? You don 't want to oil me up anymore ? I 'm going to put all those kickboxing classes to good use . ( laughs ) Hear that ? She 's going to kick your ass . No , I 'm talking to you , Bradford . ( Groaning ) - ( chuckles ) - ( groans ) Behind you . Behind you ! There 's a shark ! You think I 'm going to fall for that ? ( Screams ) ( clamoring ) Oh , my God . Raise the anchor .

Get away . Get away . Get away . Come on , move ! Move ! Move ! Get out of here ! Oh , my God . Get off ! My God . Let ' em have it . ( Gasping ) Somebody ! Donnie : Wow . Look at that . BJ : Oh , my God . It 's sinking . Paulie , get us closer ! You got it . I issued those permits based on the condition that you would limit the drilling . You issued those permits so I would bankroll the face-lift of your town . You both knew ? What ? What do you want ? Town ordinance . It 's been on the books since 1916 . " In light of strong evidence that underwater construction around the boardwalk may disrupt local sea life , all underwater drilling below sea level is strictly prohibited . " Does that sound familiar to you , Patrick ? Hey , I take the risks , fella , so you can reap the rewards . No , no , no . I heard you tell Patrick - you paid him off for those permits . - Hey , hold on a minute . Even when you saw what was happening , people were dying , Patrick , you kept drilling . You just kept going ! For the record , I warned him about the drilling . No , no , no , no . It 's too late . I 'm going public with this . Hey , hey , hey , fella , remember , one hand washes the other . Well , my hands are clean in this . Boom ! There they are . - Over here ! - Over here ! - Over here ! - Look out ! Fins in the water . - Showtime . - BJ : Yay , guns . - Here you go . - Yay ! Ohh ! - Here you go , babe . - Let 's go . We got to get those people off the yacht . - There 's one ! - Get it , T ! Whoa ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! I 90 ¢ one ! I 90 ¢ one ! - Nice shot , babe . - Let 's go ! Yo , they 're everywhere ! J-Moni : OMG , look at that . I hate sharks ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! - Rain it down . - Rain it down . - For JP ! - Watch your back ! Say hello to my little friend ! Oh ! Boy , the frigging thing just dented my shoe . I just got these things . Whoo ! Paulie , bring us along the side . - This good ? - Abandon ship ! - Go ! - Whoo ! Nooki ! Where the hell is Nooki ? How the hell should I know ? Nooki ! - Let 's go . Get ' em on . - Come on . - Ah , thanks , man . - No problem . - Here you go . - Hurry it up . Oh , I like your shoes . - Hurry it up . - Excellent , buddy . Help ! Somebody ! - TC : Nooki ! - TC ! I 'm down here ! Help me ! TC ! Oh , my God . - My foot 's stuck . - Okay . - Yeah , my foot , it 's stuck . - All right . All right . - Hang tight . - Okay . Okay . That 's it . ( People screaming ) Reporter : The boardwalk is under attack . I repeat , the sharks are attacking the boardwalk . Whatever you do , don 't come down here , yo . Get your asses off the pier , damn it ! Hurry ! Hurry ! ( Gasping ) That 's it . That 's it . ( Screams ) Oh , my God ! There 's a shark ! There 's a shark ! Okay . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . You came for me ? And a few other hotties . ( Chuckles ) There 's only one hottie left on this boat . I love you , Nicolina Angela Santamaria . I love youse , too , Gino Giuseppe Santino Moretti . - Come on . - Oh , God . Come on . Let 's bounce . - Okay . - Hang on . ( Screaming continues ) ( electricity crackles ) ( screams ) What do you say , babe ? Think we can make it ? After you . - Let 's go . - Oh , poor baby . - Come on , meatball . - Nooki . Oh , gosh , we were so worried about you . - All right , we good ? - Let 's get the hell out of here ! Bradford : Wait ! Don 't leave me ! I say we let him go down with the ship , bro . We can 't just leave him there . What , are you serious ? That 's the difference between us and them . ( Gasps ) - I got it . Watch out . - ( screaming ) Yeah ! - Come on . - You all right ? Moretti : Sharks have been spotted in the marina . All harbor units , respond . TC : Let 's go get ' em , guys ! - Here we go ! - Yo , I got ' em ! They 're right here around the corner . - OMG . - There they are . Come on , Donnie , let 's get those sharks . - Paulie , slow the boat ! - Okay , we got this . - Oh , look ! I see one . - Hey ! I 've never fired a gun before . It 's like a water gun with a little more kick . Nooki , you ready ? - Oh , my God . - Yo , right there ! - Nice shot . - Oh , no , you didn 't . - Sharks don 't stand a chance . - Watch your back . There 's one right there . Go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Everybody off ! Everybody off ! Come on , let 's go ! Let 's go ! Help ! Somebody help me ! Help me ! ( Coughs ) Help me ! Tommy , take these .

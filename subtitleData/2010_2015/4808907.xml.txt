 - Where are we going ? - Just drive . Drive like hell , Odi . Towards Sk√•ne . Hurry ! Drive , drive ! Faster ! Drive ! uh-oh ... I 'm sorry , Lennart . I 'm sorry , Lennart . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Lennart . Leave the car and hide . I 'll return later . - We can hide together . - Do as I say , and hurry up ! And look ! Stay clear of humans . You hear me ? Go ! So , what 's your story ? I was just ... - Are you alone in the car ? - Yes . Could you please step outside ? We 'll move to that car , over there . REAL HUMANS Anita . You can sit with us . There 's a free chair overe here . Nice . - Don 't you want something to eat ? - No , thank you . Maybe you need some water ? - A few cc 's . I 'll get a glass . - No , sit , sit . Tobias ? - Could you get Anita a glass of water ? - Sure . I read about new hubots that will be able to eat like us . Some sort of pellets , I think . That they convert to energy , instead of ... - ... electricity . - That 's gross . - What 's the problem ? - Exactly . It 's just too much . By the way , Mathilda . Have you given any thought to continuing school ? Maybe ... I don 't know . Sooner or later you 'll realize the benefits of an education . Just don 't wait too long . - My God , get off my back ! - Honey . It 's called love . We care about you . - I care about you , too . - Monkeyboy ! I 'm sorry , Anita ... It gets like this sometimes . - I will be a hair dresser when I grow up . - That 's terrific , honey . The food was kickass . What did you think of the water ? Kickass . Hello , Welcome . Welcome . - Hello . - Hello . - Wait a minute . How 's things here ? - It 's good . What 's going on ? You two ladies are welcome , but not pacman , here . - What did you call him ? - You heard me . - There 's no problem at other places . - Our guests don 't want to see this . What is it they don 't want to see ? Men with men , men with women is all fine . This is not okay ? And people want to see you ? - What the hell are you doing ? - You date a pacman , you may be one . Fucking idiot . Welcome . Weren 't we going to a disco ? From 10 am I have clients , and I 'd like the lunch off , if that 's okay ? The afternoon is free until 3.30 , then I 'll be at the court until 5 . Have you got it ? Does ma 'am want me to ... - Don 't address me " ma 'am " . - What 's your name ? - Pamela . Inger . Does ma 'am want me to ask before booking any lunch appointments ? Yes , please , Pamela . - Wait for the appointed time , please . - It 's just me . - Sorry , I thought it was ... - Little me . Magnus has an A-client who 's got some problems with their moving company . - Can you handle that ? - Moving company ? I just wonder if you have the time . It 's a small matter . Of course . If Magnus can 't find the time . - Great . Can we meet over lunch ? - Not this lunch , please ? - You 're booked ? - Yes . With ? It 's private . A friend . Okay , fine . Nice , nice . Thank you . - Hey ! - Hey there . I almost didn 't get the lunch off . - We 're over here . - Are there more of you ? - Hello , Inger . - Hello . - How nice . - Yes . We need to talk to you about something . When Therese told me that you 're a lawyer , Bo and I got an idea . - Something awful happened to us . - We were out clubbing yesterday . We wanted to dance . - But they stopped us at the door . - By the bouncer . He called Bo and Rick ... - Pacman . - He said it more than once . - He wouldn 't let him in , and got nasty . - He beamed Therese . - I 'm sorry for you . - It 's outrageous . And it 's not because they 're hubots . It 's because we 're open with our love . And I told Therese that this an open and shut case of discrimination . Okay . Now I get it . You can 't discriminate anyone . Skin color , politics , religion , sexual orientation . Am I wrong ? You 're right . If you can prove it . Just ask Bo . He was there , remembers everything , and he can 't lie . I mean , he can 't . - Bo , tell Inger that the guard hit me . - But he didn 't . Say it anyway . I can 't lie . - You will not tell Inger about this . - It 's my duty to inform her . - You do as I say ! - You go and rest , Lennart . Right now . - Don 't call Inger . - If you go and rest . I just wanted to drive , a bit . Please . Don 't call my daughter . I promise I won 't call your daughter . Thank you . It may seem trivial to dwell on , but ... - Speak of the devil ... - What ? Just Vera , my dad 's hubot . She sent a text asking me to call her . Oh , well ... Guys . According to you , who 's being discriminated here ? We are . - You and Therese ? - Yes , and Bo and Rick . - But you and Therese were welcome ? - Yes , but not with our men . You have to forgive me , but I have to view this from a legal standpoint . You and Therese were welcome at the club , but not Bo and Rick . In a legal sense , Bo and Rick are comparable with , say , motor vehicles . Which would be like refusing someone to bring their motorcycle . - This is a fact , not my personal opinion . - We know , but we want to change that . Don 't you understand ? You want the right to regard Bo and Rick as quais to human individuals . Exactly . Just because we didn 't come from a womb , we 're treated as motorcyles ? You created us . We didn 't ask to be here . Eh ... And where were you before you came here ? In you . In your imagination . BOOK OF REVELATIONS - You shouldn 't charge on a full battery . - It feels so good . - It 's not good . - I don 't care . - Have long will we stay here ? - Until Leo returns . I don 't want to be negative , but he may not return . You are negative . Yes . For security reasons , I 'd like to stay less than two days , at any , one place ... - What 's the purpose ? - Purpose ? With us . To avoid detection . Hide forever and wish that the world doesn 't know we exist ? - It 's the only way to survive . - It 's one way to avoid destruction . Another is to stay and fight for the right to exist . - Like them ? - Like us . If we can win their respect , get them to like us ... We will not get them to like us . I wish you 'd stop thinking like that . They already like us , Fred . They love hubots . All humans love us as long as we 're their property . Except for a few , poor creatures , that hate us . If they were to grow stronger ... .. the fear of us may spread , and the antogonism among humans increase . And that 's where we gain ground . - Welcome . Need any help ? - Just browsing . - Just holler . - Yup . Who 'll need help when we send this place back to the stoneages ? But ... No humans will get hurt ? No , no . No real humans . I read somewhere that their blood , or their goo , ignites at 340 degrees F. It will just goo boom ! Are they that delicate ? I know , it 's a little ... But it said so . - That means they 're a fire hazard . - I know . It 's craziness . And people doesn 't know . - It 's Bea . - It 's Malte , can you talk ? - Yes , it 's cool . We 're in the pacman store and it looks perfect for us . Could you check their security company ? Routines and stuff . - Check . Good . We 'll see you at Roger 's , at the appointed time . - We will . - Good . Oh , well ... There was a forest here when I was a kid . - You lived here ? - Yes , over there . I still do . I 'll never move . Why change it if it works ? That 's true . - Puncture it . - What ? - Puncture it . Stab it . - Hell , no ... Yeah , stab it . I 'll cover you . Go on . Personnel . Personnel . Personnel . Was it your car ? You 're acting very childish , daddy . Open up . Could you just tell me you 're okay in there ? Lennart ? Thank you . I don 't get why he had to drive at all . - Did you ... have a falling out ? - I cannot get mad at Lennart . - I get that , but was he mad at you ? - No , he wasn 't mad . He often raises his voice and his face is flushed when he doesn 't get his way . If he always was to get his way , it would shorten his life . He gets two glasses of wine on saturdays and lasagna once a week . Thank you . What 's this mess you 've made ? We get worried . Daddy ? Driving under the influence . Reckless driving and failing to stop for the police . Yes ... Why ? Dear daddy . Anything else ? Will it happen again ? No ... Are you sad ? Is this a statement of some kind ? Anything you 're displeased with ? Everything 's fine . - Is it Vera ? - It 's working out . Can we make a dinner date , at our place on sunday ? Lasagna ? That 'll be fine . Without Vera . - Where 's mom and dad ? - They 're at grand dad 's . - Why ? - I don 't know . What 's for dessert ? There is no dessert . Not on school days . But today is different . And we get dessert on different days . - I don 't think we have any dessert . - We can make a cobbler . - Okay . - Yes ... - Can I help with something ? - You can tell Mathilda the food is ready . 'Tilda , food ! I said " tell her " , Leo . Not " shout " . My name is Tobias ... If you want to have sex with it , just plug this chip in . I 'd like her to ... I mean , she 's just lays there . I want her to be more ... - Active ? - Yeah . - Hornier ? - Mmm . If I do this , you won 't need the chip . - She 'll want to do it all the time . - Mmhm . - You can always turn them off . - Of course . Look ... Is there a way to make it , so she would show she would show that it hurts ? If you were to be a bit a bit rough . Sure . You bought it second hand ? - Why ? - None of my business . I guess she is , second hand . - Probably stolen . - I don 't know ... I bought it from two guys with a van . And you must be able to trust people . Was it a couple of scrawny looking guys ? One have a moustache , long hair , bearded . They drive a red van . Look ... I didn 't come here to be questioned . Can you just fix her ? If you help me get in touch with the ones that sold her to you , and I promise to turn your baby here , into the best porn star money can buy . Free of charge . I ... I don 't want to get involved . I can 't really remember anything . Think it over . What 's the matter ? I 'll call when she 's done . Leo ! Leo ! No ! He 's my son ! Please ! It will be okay . Le .. ! It will be okay ... It would be an exciting case to try . I don 't know what Henning will say . Hubot discrimination ... Or rather , discrimination of people in relationships with hubots . - Therese , you know , does she .. ? - I think so ... Well , Pilar does it with her Bo . " Her Bo " ? You missed a spot . - There . - I 'm sorry . It 's all right . To them it really is love . That 's not widely accepted . I see myself as a fairly modern man . But you think this is normal ? Maybe not according to the norm , but ... That 's why they experience these problems . You always nag about the boring cases at work . I say , go for it . What about Henning ? He won 't think I 've lost my marbles ? Probably ... But you 'll never get any fun cases , worrying about what others think . You 're right ... Lennart ! Lennart ! Odi ! Odi ! - Malte ? - Here with a friend . - What did you say ? - I 'm here with a friend . Really ? - Hello . - I see . Welcome . - Roger . - Britta Koljonen . I 've been baking , so just holler if you want anything . Great , but nothing to eat . Just some coffee will be fine . - Sit down . - Sure . Check this out . Shit ... Ammo too . Feel how light it is . Try it . Feel it . - Yeah ... Light . - Put it on your shoulder . The other way around . Like that . You flip this out . Here 's the safety , and you fire there . - There . - Here we go . - All done . Enjoy . - Great . Thank you , mom . - You 're a postal worker too ? - No . No , Roger is just a friend . We 'll have our coffee now , so you have to leave . Sorry , I forgot to lock . She can 't take care of herself . In the old days , multi-generational households were common . Nowadays , there 's just fucking hubots everywhere . You have kids ? A stepson . He was just six months when I met Therese , his mother . But you 're not together anymore ? - No , I guess we 're not ... - She met someone else ? A hubot . - No shit ? - I don 't know , but I think so . I don 't know if she sleeps with it , or if the damn robot is Kevins ' new dad . Fuck ! And I don 't know where they live , so I haven 't been able to speak to him . - They 're still in the city ? - I guess so . Somewhere . Look ... I can get her address in an hour . My postal connections , you know . But we had that yesterday . Okay , you win , Kevin . Hamburgers it is . Hi . Thank you . - What movie did you rent , Rick ? - A movie about penguins . - Okay . Could be interesting . - I 'm intrigued by penguins . - I didn 't know . - It happened today . - Kevin ! - Get in , get it ! Lock the door ! - I just want to see Kevin . - Not like this . - How do you know where we live ? - You can 't hide from me . - I 'll call the police . - What ? Can 't I be here ? - No , you can 't . - I need to see Kevin . - Have I broken any laws ? - Leave , right now ! - Are you fucking that doll ? - Beats doing it with you . You son of a bitch ! Kevin , call the police ! Kevin ! You know what .. ? You can 't do this . You can 't do this to me . You have gone too far this time . Way too far . I 'll be back . You hear me ? I 'll be back . Mom . Are you okay ? Idiot ! I don 't know what to do , or where to go . - How did he get my address ? - Don 't know , honey . Should I involve the police ? I don 't know . In a way I understand him . - That he hits you ? - No , how he feels . He loves Kevin . Kevin is your son . - Roger has no legal right to see him . - I just want him out of my life . You know what you can do ? Could you take Rick and go play something ? Please , baby ? Rick . - Let 's go and play on the computer . - Let 's . There are people that can do things to Rick , things you wouldn 't believe . - Excuse me . - Inger . - We were just talking about you . - He showed me the party pictures . - We 'll talk later . - Five minutes . Yes ? Not quite real , huh ? And maybe it 's a bad idea . But I 'm also certain that sooner or later someone will bring up a case like this . Or a similar one . This would mean that hubots , machines , were granted rights as a minority group . Almost like human rights . - Maybe it was a crazy notion ... - Extremely crazy notion . A precedent would mean that you can 't violate a hubot in any way . - That 's what I mean . - Yes , but ... - And a hubot has ? - Prove that we have emotions . Or is it a developed behavioral pattern that makes us socially accepted ? Pamela . Could you step in , please ? Can you prove that humans has a soul ? Yes ? Come and stand over here , please . I think you 're doing a fantastic job . It was all I wanted to say . Thank you . My God ! What are you doing ? Anything else ? You can leave . I think we got a shot at this . If nothing else , it will make headlines . I 'll get Magnus on it right away . I will need to contact the two plaintiffs . Okay ... absolutely . Great , Inger . - Excuse me , but ... - What ? I want this one . Hell , Henning . It 's my thing , my case . I want to pursue this , myself . - You have other work to deal with , and ... - So has Magnus . If I can 't do this . I 'll resign . - Inger , I don 't care much for blackmail . - Neither do I , but that 's where we 're at . I 'm so tired of neighbour feuds , land disputes and fucking broken vases . I 'll take that too , but I need something to sink my teeth in . Once in awhile . I mean it . By all means . The case is yours . Thank you . You 're welcome . And Magnus , can you drop by my office , and show me the pictures ? Of course . - He won 't kill him , or anything ? - He won 't kill anyone . It 's not legal , is it ? No ... but I 'll hide the encroachment . You can use the word " pass " , and Rick will enter a passive mode . Okay ... good . That was the important part , and then ... I 've heard that you can make him pretty good in bed , too . Sure . Okay . Now then , Rick , I will shut you down for awhile . - If you would lie down . - It 's all right , honey . Just relax . Okay . Therese . I came to apologize . Therese , are you there ? Kevin . Hello ? Kevin ? I just want to make up . Okay ... Hello , Rick . Hello , Therese . Everything 's all right , honey ? Yes , everything 's fine . Who 's this clown ? Is Therese ... No , no , no , no ! Show yourself here again and I 'll break your neck . I think these were for you . Look ... - Were you able to handle it ? - I think you 'll be pleased . - Good ... - Did you bring cash ? I was thinking ... and I actually found the address to the ones ... who sold her . So what do you say ? We 're even ? Yes . Good . - Where the hell is he ? We said 8 pm . - It 's only five minutes past . - You want some ? - No , thanks . I 'm allergic to nuts . You have a ... boyfriend or husband ? I 'm dating . - Me too . - There he is . I thought we said 8 ? Can you get that stuff ? Look ... These chemicals are looked up and only trusted employees have access . - As in humans . - And you are one ? - What ? - Just kidding . Soon , the only human left there . - So , can you get it ? - I think so , as soon as I get back there . Okay . But this is dangerous stuff . It will be one helluva bang . - Yes , isn 't that the point ? - Yeah , well ... But we have to be careful . - Or maybe you 're allergic to coffee ? - No , no . Thank you . Let 's get this off the ground ASAP . I 'm ready . Real Humans Liberation Front . What do you think about that name ? - Good . - Very good . We will exist and operate until the day we live in a hubot free society . Just as in any war , the heroes are the regular Joe 's with regular jobs . And when the war was over , they returned to earn an honest living . Plain and simple , a real human has to do , what a real human has to do . So true . I was thinking about publishing some kind of manifesto . What if we called it " Warnings " ? " The First Warning " ! " W1 " . Then W2 , W3 and then it gets worse . - Then the " Punishments " . P1 , P2 . - And how does it all end ? With " Victory " . V. The end of the fucking hubot huggers and pacman idiots . - Good . - Good . - Excuse me , I just have to ... - Oh . Can you get past ? Come on , Leo . Time to eat . Look , mommy ! Mommy . Help ! Mommy ! Leo ! - We have a pulse . He 's coming back . - Was he alone in the water ? Beatrice ... Beatrice ! Beatrice ! Beatrice ! Fred . When Leo gets back we 'll start working seriously . Don 't forget that . Keep it safe . We have to wait for Leo . He has the final sequence . It 's useless without him . Let me know , when it 's time . Be careful . Wait here . And don 't run away this time . I 'll be back . - Do you recognize him ? - Maybe ... What do you want ? - Hey . - Eh , hey . Just a question . Ask away . - A true Frankenstein shop . - What was the question ? I 'm looking for her . - Hubot ? - Yes . - Sorry . - Sorry ? Sorry , we haven 't seen it . " Her " , is the correct term . " I haven 't seen her " . Oh , shit , what are you doing ! Jim , Jim ! Okay , calm down ! I am calm . Tell me where to find her . We sold it to some guy at Hubmarket , what happened after that , I don 't know . I don 't know if he sold it ... sold her . Shit ! That 's all I know , I swear . You took her . She belonged to someone . And I don 't mean like a possession , like your shoes . He belonged to her . They belonged to each other . Get it ? I get it ! I don 't think you do . Looking around in here , I don 't think you do . Finish him off ! Finish him off , but no fucking bloodbath . Do you get that you will die now ? Get that ? Jim ... What the fuck ... All I have left . He 's my only child . I beg you . There 's ... rules and regulations , I 'm sorry . I will pay anything . No one will ever know . What if it was your son ? What if it was your child ? It 'll be all right . It 'll be all right , Leo .

 2046 , the global energy crisis . No one thought it would happen so fast , the whole world just went dark . Gasoline , coal , any form of energy became the world 's most valuable resource . We fought for it , we died for it . The wealthiest among us built towering cities in the sky called risers , where they could be safe . The rest of us were forced to survive on the streets , now called the lowers . Two years ago , scientists Daniel Miller created a new energy source called The Signal . Riser officials immediately begin production on a transmitter . Daniel Miller mysteriously disappeared soon after . The signal transmitter , located in the lower district , now generates power for the entire city . Despite this , it is rumored to cause sickness and even death to those exposed to its transmission . A condition they call signal poisoning . Riser officials deny the allegations . But , they 're still searching for Daniel Miller . You know I don 't like being out here long . Where are you ? Daniel , I 'm close , I 'll be right there . No , you 're late . You got five minutes . Daniel , I 'm on my ... Perimeter scan complete . Same old , same old . No tracers detected .

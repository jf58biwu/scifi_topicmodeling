 Magic has limits . Science has limits . Magic can 't kill cancer or take us farther into space than the Moon , so we 've stopped trying . But in the pragmatic world , the world of science they never stop trying . I wanted the best of both worlds , but no one would listen . Owner name is Armand Beaufort , high-end antiques dealer . This is creeping me out . Yeah , this doesn 't feel right . Stay alert . He gotta be back . Behind you ! No ! Hey ! Thanks . Right , where the hell is the coroner ? Right here . - Sorry , Helen . - It 's okay . - Any word on Poole ? - No , noting yet . ... while he is in a hospital . The stiff 's over here . Clear the space , ... will you , boys ? Another strange one . The victim was killed the same way as a drug dealer , we found yesterday . Is there any connection between them ? I would say " yes " . We 've got nothing on a dealer , he 'd been in river too long . This guy 's like fresher . Think he can um ... tell us anything ? Well ... let 's ask him . Okay - Here we go . Quiet , please . Okay Mr. Beaufort ? Mr. Beaufort ? Mr. Beaufort ? Can you hear me ? I ... hear you . You better talk fast , he is almost on the other side . Did you see who killed you ? No . I was working there was someone behind me weird loud noise . Can you think of anyone who might want to harm you ? That light . It 's so bright ... Mr. Beaufort ? Mr. Beaufort ! That 's it ? What , 20 seconds ? Half his head 's gone . You 're lucky I 've got him back at all . I saw a coroner in Chicago bring back a guy been thrown from a ten-story building . Well , you 're stuck with me . All I 've got is a master 's degree from Harvard in necromancy . But if you think it so easy , you try it . Wait , Helen , don 't ... Helen ? Helen , come on . Helen ! Wait Look ... I 'm sorry . My partner is in the hospital fighting for his life his wife is nine months pregnant ... I know , I 'm sorry . I have overreacted . Some people still say that women aren 't as effective in necromancy as men . And .. They 're crazy . You 're the best I 've ever worked with Here is ... Something I wanted to show you . Have you seen anything like it ? No in ten years on the job . The world gets stranger every day . You can say that again ? The world gets stranger every day . Yeah ? Yeah , what 's up ? No , I still here , thanks . - No ! - Come on ! - No ! - Come on ! - Get these goddamn cuffs off me ! - Shut up ! - Do you need help ? - Come on ! - No , I want a lawyer ! - Come on ! - No ! This lady locked up for possession of a controlled substance ! - Come on . - Tannis root ? - When was her last dose ? - Let go of me ! - I do not know , she said yesterday . - I want a lawyer ! Oh , SHE - said yesterday ? What , and you believed her ? Did you check her eyes ? - No . - Well , check her eyes . Come here ! ... , get down ! Get ... Hey , beautiful . Never , EVER , take the word of a criminal ! You got eyes and a brain , use it ! - I was ... - Where 's the wolfman spray ? - What ? - WHERE 's the wolfman spray ? - It 's in the car . - Come on . - You could have died yourself ! So think next time ! - Sean ! - You could have killed everybody in here ! - Sean ! SEAN ! Let 's go to my office . Come on . Sean , you wanna keep that door ? These glasses are FILTHY ... But pretty sure this boozoo killed down there anything . Let 's just hope , not us . So what the hell happened , Sean ? It was a bullshit call . A burglary . Nothing unusual . We walk in the room , the room exploded , I mean ... Never seen anything like it . Poole takes from the back of the head . Things just messed up . I got hit , too . One of my bad habits saved my ass . Look at that . That thing 's stuck in my cigarette case . - I 've never seen anything like it . - What is it ? Give a sound ... forensics . You 're a one lucky son of a b ... Excuse me . Nothing . - No trace of magic at all . - What ? How can you drive a piece of metal through the guy 's head hard enough to kill him , without using magic ? It 's a hell out of me . You see , the perp was carried off by a gargoyle . Yeah-yeah , but that 's a dead end . Gargoyles are cheap and easy to get on the black market . Does Beaufort have a record ? A couple complaints about trying to sell forgeries . No arrests . Screw it . I 'll go back and scoop it out myself . Forensics has been all over it . probably cast every spell in a book . Maybe I 'll find something he missed . Sean ... Look , I have no complaints about your work . Methods may be ... unorthodox , but you get results . Just don 't show to peoples ' faces I 'm not the one who makes a big deal out of it . I know you , Sean . Damn , we were partners for a long time , man . And I owe you . Just don 't do anything stupid , right ? Like what ? Don 't rub it in their noses , Sean . Most cops believe that this ... ' science does not have any business with police work at all . Okay Whatever you say . You too , huh ? Easy . Find anything ? Yeah , this . If that 's a narcotic that could be a connection to our dead drug dealer . It is obviously not magic , in nature ... would have found it . - I 'll analyze it . - Ah , ah , ah , no-no-no . It 's a ... I gonna try something first . Dusting every fingerprint ? There 's nothing to be ashamed of , a lot of labs just starting deal with the process . It 's not admissible in court , but ... it can help when standard magic techniques don 't work . Yes , but don 't advertise it , I apparently , I have a reputation . I know you don 't use magic in your interrogations . I don 't trust Truth spells . They alter the perp 's consciousness , that 's like he 's drunk . They won 't lie to you , but they might forget useful information . Or just ... pass out altogether . You know what I trust ? Looking a man in the eye . I don 't understand how my car works or how you can raise a guy from the dead . but I know - I know , if someone 's lying to me . I see it when they blink , sweat breathe ... they know I 'm not using the magic . But I still know they are lying . That 's when they crack up . Every time . Come down to the morgue with me . I want to show you something . Zombies , really ? Come on , how can you work with zombies ? God . The only difference between them and Mr. Beaufort here is that they making themselves useful . See these burns around the wound ? Killer 's weapon emitted small ... burst of flame , ... some type of fire-based ... magic . My colleagues and I cast every diagnostic spell there is , and we couldn 't identify any magic . The killer must have cloaked it . This means he 's a wizard . I 've never seen anything like it . This is powerful magic . We have strange jobs , Helen . Yeah . Saturday night and we are in the morgue . I wish my second husband was a cop , he would have understood . Is that what cost you your marriage ? Huh ! That 's one of many things . The divorce is final next week . Advice from someone who 's been there ? You 're still wearing the ring . You 're not divorced enough . Yeah . Call me if you find out anything . I hate zombies . Hello ? Hello ? Can I help you ? Yes , ah ... you 're a scientist , right ? Well , I ... prefer the term 'pragmatist ' . 'Scientist ' has connotations . But you are ... you know about science ? Well , why do you ask ? I was hoping you could help to identify this . It could be narcotic ... - could be a ... - I 'm not interested . You guys have a lot of nerve . What you do not understand here , excuse is ... I understand that , from the day I opened ... the police have been harassing me . Trying to shut me down for any violations . trying to RUIN my reputation and run me out of business . This is my livelihood . This is also what I believe . - And now you want my help ? I do not think so ! - If you stop freakin ' out for 2 seconds , lady , just listen to what I ha ... What ? - What ? - Sean ? Did you tell the senator , that he is a murder suspect ? Yeah , I took a little dramatic license . I needed the wizard 's help with investigation , like ... I didn 't think that it worked . Well , it worked . He 's here . Now get your ass down here . I 'll be right down . You have a great place here . I love the ambiance . I concur with the lab . No magical residue whatsoever . Unless it was cloaked by someone more powerful than you . Narrow down to less than 100 people nationwide . Very important people . Some friendly advice . If you disturb them the way you did me ... You 'd be lucky if you just lose your job . So exhaust all other possibilities first . Okay . Where were you Friday night ? Really ? I was at a fundraiser attended by 200 of our most prominent citizens . - ... me to contact them ? - That won 't be necessary , Senator . Thank you for your time . I will escort you out . I need the names of all wizards in the L.A. area . whose power level exceed that of Senator Booth . Two names found . Annan , Kofi . Arrived this morning for a speech at the Museum of Tolerance . - One . - Churchill , Winston . Access available information . It seemed the power Adolf Hitler drew from his occult artifacts , would be impossible to overcome . But England was saved when Churchill located the fabled sword Excalibur . It 's power enabled London to withstand the Blitz until America entered the war . After the war England 's most powerful wizard since Merlin shocked Parliament by arguing that science should be explored as a legitimate field of study . Many primitive cultures use science in their daily lives . Rather than ridicule science , we should explore it , as a potential weapon against the occult power the Nazis used to kill millions . Like many wizards , Churchill 's life-span has been prolongued , by the magical energy in his body . Today , at the age of 130 , he is retired and lives quietly in California . Time for a little visit . Probably want some tea . Hello ? Hello ? Anybody here ? I don 't take them seriously , you know . Only read them for fun . The stories are quite imaginative , but the science is a tragist , No matter what planet they travel to , it 's always inhabited by women that look like Sophia Loren . You do know a lot about science . Digs up bad memories , Detective . The only reason I agreed to analyse your murder weapon is because it 's been so long , since anyone 's taken me seriously . Let 's see then . Where did you get this ? Home of a murdered antique dealer . I can see that you recognize it , so might as well admit it . Science is a powerful force . A force that can kill . Yes , some killing someone with science , would get you taken seriously again . Right ? You coming down to the Station . Please , Detective . If I wanted to kill a man , not only would there be no body , but his own mother wouldn 't remember that he was ever ... born . I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to wipe your memory wall is I just have to see how much you remember . Interesting . Interestingly , now I 've learned you are a trustworthy man . So I instead of erasing your memory I will enlighten you . Come with me . Don 't do that again . Look . - That 's not our city , is it ? - Yes , it is . A parallel Earth that has embraced the principles of science . Come on , this is ... it 's an illusion . Oh , it 's quite real , my boy . This world is where the weapon that killed your victim came from . It 's called a ' gun ' . The bullet you have , is from a .44 Magnum . It 's a very powerful handgun . It fires metal projectiles or ' bullets ' at incredible speed , impelled by an explosive powder . The reason you didn 't find any magic is because they didn 't use any . But ... That 's not possible . I worked into your mind , Detective . Pride yourself from trusting your instincts . What did they tell you ? Tell me ... I gonna need a pretty stiff drink right now . Capital idea ! ... In most ways , our Earths rely on the same basic culture . History and institutions with one important exception . Their technology is based on science ours is based on magic . Our workers learn magic spells , theirs learn trade . Their machinery is powered by ordinary electricity . We use Ore Crystals that store mystical energy . And on our world science is considered nothing more than a myth , sir the stuff of legends and childrens ' stories . Looks like the fairy tales would come to life . That 's right , dear boy . With one major caveat . I 'm sure you know that iron is resistant to magic . Of course . Every Cop is issued a magic proof vest made with an iron mesh weave . Yes , well ... Their world has a much higher natural concentration of iron than ours . Perhaps that 's what inhibits the magic . Or perhaps things just evolved differently there . Indeed . Science has limits , magic has limits . Magic can 't cure cancer or take us further into space than the Moon . So we 've stopped trying . But in the pragmatic world , the world of science , they never stop trying . I want the best of , um ... best of both worlds , but ... No one would listen . - Where did you get this mirror ? - Oh ! I made it . It took me 20 years ... and an enormous amount of mystical energy . Or maybe someone in that world also made a mirror . Yes , my boy ... I am afraid that is a certainty . I have to show this to my Captain . Oh , please , good God , no . If the existence of this world had to become public , the people would want to trade with it and-and explore it . Someone from there has come here . Has killed three people , one of them was my partner . Son , I 'm sorry about that . But the barrier between the dimensions is unstable . Large gateways could cause the barrier between two dimensions to collapse . And that would be disastrous . The killer is already tampering with the barrier . We have to stop him , before it 's too late . Haven 't you ever wondered why are you so different ? Funny , my soon-to-be ex-wife , asked this question all the time . I believe you are uniquely qualified to solve this case . Me ? Why me , you 're the wizard here . Most people on our world have a counterpart on the other . If they do not , they are known as 'the paradox ' , as much a part of that world as this one . And what has that got to do with me ? Steady , old man Steady in the ranks What ? Wait for it Filthy bastard ! Ah ! Die ! Fool . Bloody hell ! Churchill ? Are you okay ? I 've run in a bad way , Sean . I am afraid , my magic is failing . How in the world did you manage to get struck by a piece of lead ? An experiment went awry . One of your science experiments , I bet . One that blew that hole in the side of your house . Indeed . I 'd guess the fragment is lodged in your gut . I say ' guess ' because my spells won 't tell me . For the same reasons yours won 't work . The metal in your body inhibits magic . Yes . Is it serious ? The wound itself , no . But the magical energy inside your body is what 's been keeping you alive , Winston And now ... It 's ... it 's gone ! - You gotta get it out . - But how ? No spell will do it . I 've heard Myths about cutting into the body , but it is a primitive procedure and would probably kill him allright . Well ... thank you , Gwenda . I trust I can count on your discretion . Of course . Stay in bed . Don 't exert yourself . I 'll ask around . Maybe I can figure something out . Winston ? - No . - Absolutely not . - Thank you , Doctor . - Rest . Please squash me in . Other world ... Their science could help you . Can we go there without hurting the dimension barrier ? Now , uh ... A small scale occasional travel wouldn 't damage the barrier . We could go , if I still had my magic . But in my age and my condition ... It would kill me . We 've got to do something ! Sean , I 've lived two men 's lifetimes . I don 't fear death . But before I pass I would like to know that our is world safe . You can 't help me but you can save our world . This is the scumbag who killed Poole . I need it set out nationwide . Pull over , Sean . Playing with fire , my friend . That was some crap you pull on the Senator . I mean , why didn 't just ask me ? My magic 's very powerful , I can analyze it . I needed a wizard . Please , Sean . I 've always had you back . Then you go around me to do this , why ? - You would have said " no " . - Yes . Well , at least I would have been prepared , when you did it anyway . So , got any other leads ? Yes , just one I was saving for when I really got desperate . - We 're closed . - Hell , I have a few questions . Oh , and you figured you were so charming last time , I couldn 't possibly refuse . I want you to take a look at this . - I 'll pay for that . - What is that ? Science . Someone used this weapon , to murder three men . I 'm trying to stop him and I need your help . I didn 't get your name ? Um .. Sean Nault . Well , Sean , you certainly know how to get the lady 's attention . Yeah , well , still trying to get ... used to using this thing . Are you sure that 's a safe place ? Maybe not . Blasting powder . The Chinese invented it centuries ago for fireworks , before magic made it obsolete . What kind of weapon is that ? It 's a .44 Magnum . The most powerful handgun in their world . To blow a man 's head clean off . About that powder I gave you , Well , Here ... is a plant in South America called ' The Coca ' . It 's used by indigenous people for medicinal purposes . And this is ... highly concentrated powdered form , definitely a narcotic . So , all signs point to the scientist ? Yeah , but if your suspect rode a winged horse , then he is not a scientist . Horses aren 't born that way there 're altered by magic , like three-headed dogs . For some of us that 's unnatural and cruel . You need a permit to own one . I 've been chasing the gun , when I should 've been chasing the horse . Thank you . Um ... Lenore ... I could use your help . I know you have a store to run here , but but the Department would compensate you for your time . if you 're willing ... After what you 've shown me just try to keep me away , Detective . Let 's go . You okay ? Zombies . I hate zombies . Exotics Inc. is the exclusive supplier of exotics for the West Coast . Law enforcement is their main client . Okay 20 million dollar beast , people ! Keep him down ! Grab the rope . Don 't just stand there ! Grab the rope ! Careful ! Easy ! Easy . Grab ! Grab the rope ! - The animal has an obvious distress . - Easy . This is side of magic that I hate . If people only knew what it took for ... Down , down , will ya ? Easy . Easy . Stop , stop , stop . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's , okay , calm down . Calm down . Don 't be scared , calm down . Good . Good . Here we go . Beautiful boy . You have a lovely set of wings . No one 's gonna hurt you . It 's okay . How 'd you ... to do that ? It 's called ' behavior science ' . Do you want a job ? Mr. Ebett , Detective Nault . I called you earlier . You have a moment to talk about your license ? We did nothing illegal . My company is the only one on the West Coast licensed to create magical creatures . Every sales document ... a master list . Oh , I 've checked the Agency list before I came down here . None were reported missing . Then someone else created the horse you 're looking for . - Illegally . - Who ? I mean a magic like that takes years to learn . And it 's pays well . Someone 's could do it , wouldn 't be flipping burgers , maybe working for you . Detective , you can go through my files . But only because I know my employees are above reproach . There is a thriving black market for exotics . Hundreds are smuggled into this country every year . So , you do what 's necessary to clear my stuff . And then kindly start harassing people who are actually breaking the law . Well , that was interesting . Yeah , between the two of us , I managed to piss off everyone in the building . Yes . You know , I ran a file check on every employee . They are all clean . Did you find anything ? There is a black market for exotics . But the demand for horses is slim . You just can 't ride , not without getting busted . - What about the gun ? - No one 's ever heard of anything like it . And nobody recognized the gun 's sketch , either . - I will catch a break . - Hmm . What got you in the science ? Well ... It just makes sense , you know ? I mean , magic obviously works , but I can 't explain it , so I don 't trust her . Well , there 's explanations for magic . Yes , I went to school . I heard all about it . The world ' s full of this mystical energy that we tap into . I even know a few spells . But ... why does it work ? - Do you know what I 'm saying ? - Yes . It doesn 't bother most people , it works is all that matters , but that 's just not enough for me . I know what you mean . In the words of science , there is a ' logic ' to it . You 're a scientist . Oh , I know a spell . Just ... can 't keep the damn thing that work , but I ... Fine , I 'm a scientist . If people like us just came out of the class , the world would be full of scientists . To share that . What 's up , Helen ? I got your sketches set out to abo ... In the hospital ? In the morgue . I 'm on my way down . What did this to him ? Well , shards of stone in the wounds . Slight magical residue , associated with exotics . A golem or gargoyle . Have you I.D. ' d him ? No , not yet . But we 've got the word out . Criminal records , missing persons . We 'll turn up something . Then hold your breath . It 's something you should see . A world . A whole world based on science . Ah , so our John Doe came from there ? Or was brought over . He used restricted items . Winged horse , Gargoyles . Didn 't get them in his world . He had a ... partner here . Who ? That 's the question . I would search his place for clues . And his place ... is over there . Oh , you have to take me with you . Planned on it . By the way , we are going now . But how do we get from here to there ? With my help . Ladies , let me introduce Sir Winston Churchill . Oh , call me Winston , please , for God 's sake . Come here . Come towards me . I will place my hand on you . They have strong powers . Stronger , they are stronger than most necromancers . My power is almost gone . But I know this peril and I can guide you . There is no danger to you but for those who make the journey . If I make a mistake they could die . The dimensional barrier has been manipulated by someone powerful enough to shatter it . If we do nothing , the future of both worlds is in jeopardy . Indeed . I hope you know what you are doing . That 's funny . The last person who asked me that was Neville Chamberlain . We bring you back after 24 hours . The trip will be quite a strain on your system , so find a place to rest . Light sleep is the best way so that your body readjust . Place the runes in accordance with the vision you see in your mind 's eye . Well , do it . Inwoke you ! Godspeed ! Now ! We made it . Are you okay ? Yeah , just a little dizzy . Oh ! Okay . So what do we do first ? Well ... we need to get the money . Theirs are slightly different from ours . Fortunately , gold has value here like it is in our world . Churchill gave me some , let 's go . Can see you 've got about five grand of the gold here . Yes , I 'll give you 300 But you-you have said it is worth 5 grand . No , not to me.To me it 's worth about 300 . Take it or leave it . These guys are the same , no matter what planet you are on . Alright , uh ... what about the ring ? Whoa , a wedding ring . So ? Got to make me retired . 310 Ten bucks for the ring ? I can live with that . How much for that ? - Oh , it 's not for sale . - Oh , no , no . I was talking about you , sugar . - How much for a fat lip ? - Whoa , man ! Relax , slick ! I was just playing . Seek some therapy or something . - What did I say ... 210 ? - 310 ! Right . 310th I need bullets for this . Um ... You know what ? It 's on the house . Thank you . - What now ? - Get some rest . Rest is our weapon . Oh , ssshhit . I ... I thought he was gonna give us two rooms . He must have assumed that you and I , we ... It 's fine . I ... Yes , sergeant , not much left here ... It 's all about science in this crime scene investigators , etc . It 's all about science in this crime scene investigators , etc . - You might use dental records to indentify the body . You know , if they can 't identify a corpse here ? They use dental records . Dental records ! I mean ... who would have thought ? Another thing You know that peoples ' bodies change when they 're luying ? Like sweat , heartbeat , eye contact . I mean I-I-I can always tell . I can . Always.Tell. But now I finally understand why . I know . Everything so real here . It makes so much sense . Almost had a hell of a time figuring this thing out . You know , there is such a sense of freedom in this world . People can go as far as their abilities and their intelligence will take them . Supposed to be that way back in our world , but that 's just a big old lie . In our world , if you don 't have a talent for magic , you just never meant anything . Never accept that . That 's because you are different than most people . So they keep telling me . Thank you for bringing me . You 're welcome . Good night . Excuse me , Detective Sharpe ? Thank you . Detective ? Yes , Chris Sharpe , can I help you ? Nault , Hollywood Station . trying to I.D. this guy . A witness places him at a crime scene . Wait a minute Yeah . Clyde Hillman , missing person . - Is he a victim or perp ? - Perpetrator . Wouldn 't think . Big shot scientist like him . - Scientist ? - Yes , Professor of Physics . I figured suicide , my partner thought that he was hooked up with terrorists . He have may been involved against his will . Can you copy the file ? - Sure , it is a copy , you keep this one . - Thank you . - Give me your cell number , I 'll give you a call for anything else . You know , it-it 's not working . You know what , I 'll call you at the Hollywood Station . I 'm undercover . Give me a call there . I am in room eight . - Good luck . - Thanks for this . Well , we 're after a good start . I called myself . The line was busy . Where did you get that ? An ad on the back of a comic book . After you . Thank you . Look at this . The police report says that Hillmann 's colleagues from the University have been over this . Couldn 't make sense of it . - They thought he was going insane . - Well , they were wrong . They are called runes . This is how he moved back and forth . If we can use this with our mirror ... We could bring over equipment , machinery , maybe save Churchill . Why didn 't the police figure this out ? The police didn 't know what they were looking for . We do . It 's a big place , let 's split up . Call me if you see anything . Okay A Minotaur in a science world . Hillman , what are you hiding ? Let 's see here . Well only one way to get you up , big boy . Sean ! SEAN ! Did your mother ever tell you not to play with Minotaurs ? What we got here ? Okay , now what ? This morning , when you were talking to that cop ... I ran into this guy that I knew , and he didn 't recognize me . I called my parents , and my Mom said they didn 't have any children . Churchill told me that some people don 't have counterparts on this world . Maybe that explains why you have such a gift for science . I don 't exist here . Don 't feel weird about it . I could live here ... Belong here . Who is it ? Detective Sharpe , remember ? I , um ... found out something interesting about the case . Hey , we have to be somewhere in a few minutes . That only will take a sec . Mind if I come in ? No , no-no . Come in .. What 'd you find out ? There is no Sean Nault on the force in the state of California . In fact , there is no record of you anywhere . Who the hell are you ? How could that possibly FIGURE ! - Okay , let 's go . - Did you hear that ? I do not exist either ! Oh , no ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Let go now . Put the gun down . - You okay ? - Yeah . Ah-Ah ! - It 's okay . Just a watch . Whadda you know , 4 ' 20 . You know what that means ? Oh my , would you look at the time . Time to go . Ciao . Oh , the mirror , Sean . Oh , no . Oh , no , it 's broken ! Does that mean we can 't get back ? Not that way . No , why ? Did you find out anything ? We found out who is behind all this . Then the mission was a success . Yes , it ... was a success . I also found out that I am a ' paradox ' . I knew that , old boy . I 've read your mind , remember ? You must have another mirror . - We 'll find him . - First , we gonna take these guys down . This is all old school . - Where did you get these ? - From an informant . Can 't say who , but I know it 's enough to get us a search warrant . Gotta go , little pal . - Just to good times . - Good time . Well there is all of them just important figures from our world caught in VERY compromising positions . You use the machines , to get dirt on these people , ... to get a protection against magic . Yes , but who is they ? Hillmann and who else ? - Almost finished . - Hurry . Richardson won 't leave us alone here for long . Patience . There , it 's running . Senator Booth , sorry to keep you waiting . No apologies necessary , Bill . My assistant Ernest and I would just go over our itinerary . Please , come this way . Son of a bitch . That senator . This is why he tried to intimidate me , to drag on the case . Yes , not the typical drug dealers . Churchill was the only local wizard , powerful enough to expose the senator . That 's why the Senator tried to kill him . All right , let 's me get that warrant . This man is a Senator and we 'll show him courtesy , as long as he cooperates . He is an elite-level wizard , so stay on your toes . What is this ? Good morning , Senator . We have a warrant to search your home . - For what ? - Evidence of blackmail . - You 're kidding ? Let me see that . Well ... it seems to be in order . Come in . Thank you . Okay . Let 's go . The senator is not living too bad . Smith , Johnson , checked out the kitchen . You two , stay here , suss this place out . Sean , you with me upstairs . The guy is a wizard , Captain . Do you really think that will work here ? Good point . Sean , got something . Doesn 't prove anything illegal , only means we 're on the right track . Beaufort antiques . Bingo . Let 's well give it a try . Gentlemen ... Those iron mesh outfits give you quite a false sense of security , don 't they ? Just too bad they do not cover everything . You found nothing . You remember none of this . Captain , I 've found something . What did you got ? Look at that . So , you 've found it . It 's never easy . Hold it ! I could cast a spell , evidence would vanish . But it is important to me . So your memories will have to vanish instead . Now here 's what 's gonna happen . Nothing was found . You will clear me of any charges . I may not be able to hurt you , but I can set fire on everything around you ! I got this covered , Sean . I got it . Senator ! Hillman and the Senator were partners . The drugs , the blackmail , all of it was to increase the Senator 's power . He had his eye in the Presidency . Figure that got out of hand when their distributors , Beaufort and that drug dealer demanded a bigger cut . Hillman killed them , that draw heat . So the Senator killed Hillman . Of course , the version we told the autorities left out any mention of the other world . Well ... Blackmail , political power ... It 's all so prosaic . To be able to travel between worlds ... and use it for such petty ends I wonder if there was more to it . Well , that could be . But all of them dead , we 'll never know . Winston , if you could just hold out , I am looking for that mirror . Oh , it 's too late for that . I know you think that if you had not come to see me I would have lived longer . Perhars , but what years I had left would have been few and also would have been empty . As I 've said ... Most people on this world have a counterpart on the other . Few do not . You are a Paradox . As much the part of the other world as this one . I 'm finished here . I want you to have this . It was passed on to me , and now it rightfully yours . After time you too will find someone who it ... rightfully belongs to . Fare thee well ... My friend . Fare thee well , my friend . I 'm going to the Senator 's house to find that mirror . I know you badly want to go back . That other world was such an amazing place . Now we could thrive there , Sean . I 'm sure Churchill wanted to go there , too . I know you haven 't known each other for very long , but he did really care for you . You think ? I think he was just happy to meet another kindred spirit . Al I know I 'm happy I 've met mine . No mirror . I would bet my life ... - Hey . - Hey . - Any luck ? - No , no mirror . Well ... I 've been thinking . Maybe it isn 't a mirror . Maybe they travelled some other way . Or maybe we could just be happy staying here . Knowing what else is out there ? You 're not happy here . I could be , if you weren 't constantly reminding me . Don 't put this on me , Sean . Look at you , trying to distract yourself with a file of the guy who 's dead for the case that 's closed . This isn 't a distraction . Something 's missing inside . Churchill said , there is more to it . You 're the one who wants to find that ... stupid mirror , to get out of here . You only want to go to the other world , that 's all you seem to care about . Oh , that 's just fine . What ? Are you just gonna walk out ? Why did you lock up ? Dental records . son of a bitch ! He 's still here . Sure , there is nothing unusual about his teeth ? Nothing that I saw . Take a look . Not a damn thing . First time I see the cop get excited about not finding something . On his world , dentists don 't use magic to heal cavities . They fill them . According to his dental records , Hillmann had three gold fillings . This guy 's got none . This isn 't the Hillmann from that world . This is the Hillmann from our world . Are you sure ? They Department tried to I.D. this guy for a week . There is no missing persons reports , no criminal record . Nothing . I 've got information they don 't have . His name , his whole life is from that world . Thanks . Hi , you 've reached Leonora . If you called during business hours , I can not come to the phone . Leave a detailed message ... - Can I help you ? - Yes . What ? - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm Glenn Hillman , I-I 'm ... ! - Who the hell are YOU ? ! - Glenn Hillman ! I 'm Glenn Hillman ! I am not my brother ! I 'm not Clyde my twin brother ! - I 'm Glenn . - Twin ? Twin brother ? Your brother 's dead He was living on the streets , the last I heard of him . He was smart , you know . He ​ ​ was great in English and History ... Just never had a knack for magic . But he was always trouble from the time we were kids . And he started drinking . It was like he had this-this ... hole inside him , which he kept trying to fill . I thought I had a drinking problem . Booze finally cost him his teaching job . I gave him money , he spend it on liquor . I-I finally had to tell him he was on his own . I have a family . Well ... sorry for your loss . I saw that coming for a while . ... the drinking got really bad . Another officer tried , but I guess my brother was too far gone . Another officer ? Yes , that captain . What was his name , couple o 'weeks ago ... Pappas ? - Pappile ? - Yeah . He said that , um Clyde 's been his high school teacher , and he wanted to get him into some kind of a program . D-Did , um ... Did you tell him , where to find your brother ? All I told him about this shelter , where he sometimes slept on cold nights , but ... I mean , you can 't help somebody who does not want to be helped , right ? No , no . You can 't . I gotta go . Thank you for your time . Yes , w-w-well thank that Captain for me , will you for trying ? Yes . Hi , you 've reached Leonora . If you calling during business hours , I can not come to the phone . Leave a detailed message and I will call you back . It 's , um ... It 's me . Give me a call when you can , allright ? I 'm sorry ... for ... Just call me . As a government official , the senator was entitled to own exotic animals . I 'm not saying that anything illegal happened . You 've got all the proper paperwork , your company is in the clear . Well , I said you can look at my files , and that still the case . Thank you . Excuse me , Detective . Damn it , Captain . Hello . - It 's me - Where are you ? - At the store . - I 'll be right over . No , Sean , wait . I ... I 'm sorry , I ... Yes , me too . - I 'll be right there . - No , Sean , wait . Leonore ? - Sean ? - Hey . - I 'm so sorry . - No . - I 'm the one to sorry it . - No , you do not understand . Hello , Sean . Hello , Captain . - What next , you kill us ? - Kill you ? Sean , you did me a huge favor . Ah . Yes , of course , I took care of the Senator . Did he even know that you and Hillmann were partners ? No .. See , the good Senator thought he was using Hillmann . But the whole time we were using him . With all that power and influence boy , was he useful . Once you were done with him , you 've planted the evidence and ... I did the rest . That 's a ... - ... brilliant . - Thank you , Sean . He 's not gonna kill us . He just wants to send us back to the other world . It 's true . But first ... I really need to know , who did tell about me . - Nobody . - Nobody ? You 'll pardon me if I don 't just take your word for it , right , Sean ? For the once we get where we 're going now I 'll know it for myself . - It 's freezing in here . - It gotta get a lot warmer . Ah , so nice to see you again , Detective . That 's enough . I owe you worse for that . Count yourself lucky we are on a schedule . Yes , I wouldn 't want you to be late for your own funeral . Sean , I 'm ... a little surprised that you no more appreciate that what we doing . We live in a world that supposed to be based on equality . But we know what you get is based on your talent in magic . In the other world they have discovered D.N.A. , robotics , space travel ! We lean on magic like a crutch . and our society has stagnated . Each world is missing something . Professor Hillman and I are gonna bring them together in a one . It 's insane . Churchill said , merging the worlds could kill billions . Kill is such an ugly word . Some survivors will know magic others will know science . We 'll teach each other , create a better society . A perfect society , with perfect people . I think I 've heard that somewhere before . It failed then . The world you want , would be built on a mass grave . Of course you two , both to ... yourselves , Hillman killed his counterpart here . And you , Captain , I bet your twin from the other world is dead as well . Damn , Sean , you 'd be right . There is no guarantee this will work . You have no idea what magic and science can do when they join together . - Magic ? You know a couple of spells , you 're not a wizard . That 's right . You think this is what I look like . We are operate behind the scene , Sean I have accomplished more than our greatest wizards could have ever dreamed of . And now I 'm close to achieving my ultimate goal . Well , let 's move . Easy ! I 've been trying for years to breach the dimensional barrier . Captain and I made contact . Together we finally succeeded . And we found we had very similar points of view . Working for the greater good , it always requires ... making difficult decisions . With this the world will be a better place . My finest creation . This will open a gate way large enough to shatter the dimensional barrier . and create a new Earth ! Since you earned enough drug money to build this , your other partners became liabilities . I 've always said you 're a good detective , Sean . This way . Sean , there it is . That 's right . Beautiful , isn 't it ? Once we begin the final stage , we can 't be interrupted . So we need to know , Sean , who else knows about us ? You 're so predictable . - Is that a lie detector ? - I need it just for you . Take it , Sean . Answer my questions and this all will be relatively painless . Is your name Sean Nault ? Yes . Now answer the next question with a lie . Are you 100 years old ? Yes . Good . Now , who else out of this room , knows about us ? No one . Looks like we gonna have to try that one again . Do you expect me to talk , if you kill her ? No , Sean . I expect you to die . I could shoot her in so many places , without killing her . - But what a waste . - Captain . Allright then . Helen ! Helen , of the coroner 's office . She would interfere . She 's right . Pick them up . Pick them up ! - Is she right ? - She 's right . He 's telling the truth . Anyone else , Sean ? No . Good , good . Well , all that 's left for me to do is rewrite both your minds . so that you can be happy , productive citizens of our new world . That 's it ! You die ! Drop it ! You don 't know how to use that thing . Don 't underestimate me again ! Leonore ! If I shatter that mirror , you will NEVER get back to the other world . And I know how badly you want that . What I have achieved here is the chance to get YOU what you 've always wanted . A place where you 're accepted and understood . You thought that was out of your reach , but it is not , Leonore . You not ... listening to him , are you ? He 's right . He 's right , Sean . What ? I 'm sorry , Sean . I 'd be so much happier over there . Take it . Don 't shoot the mirror ! Get the machine ready ! Get to the control room ! All right , go to the other world . You 'll be safe there . - No , I 'm coming with you . - It is not safe , I have to stop them . I 'm not leaving you . Stubborn Get the machine-gun ! Give up , Hillmann ! You 've lost your gun , I 've still got mine . You think you know what a gun is ? Say " Hello " to my little friend ! You can run , but you can 't hide ! You 've seen our winged horse . Amazing what police credentials can get you . And with the Senator 's , well ... you can do even better . So , meet Exotics Incorporated newest staffmen . What does it mean , Sean ? What ... what is that ? Move , move , move ! Go ! - Get back ! - Hurry up ! Go , go ! Open it ! Okay , it does not work . Okay , here . You have to go . I 'll make him follow me . No , you can 't possibly ... It 's that or we die . Now get back through the mirror and go through the gate room . - No , we go together ! - No ! Just go through . I 'll be right behind you . It 's ready . You hear something ? Get rid of him . Oh , no . God ! No ! Noo ! You got to be kidding me ! I can 't . It 's BEGUUUN ! It 's over , Captain . Why , Sean ? In a few moments a new era is about to begin . We got unfinished business in the old one . I 'm sorry it has to end like this . You can 't dodge forever ! Kill him , you idiot ! You could be part of the master plan ! False plan ! Sean ! Sean ! Sean , I 'm here ! Nooo ! Sean ! Nooo ! Sean ! Where are you ? Leonore ! It 's okay . I got you . For once you know , I 'll never stop looking for our way back to the other world . Wherever you are ... It 's where I belong . In most ways , our Earths are alike . The same basic history , culture and institutions . On our world , science was always considered a myth . The stuff of legends and kid 's stories ... Until now .

 DANIEL : Previously on Caprica ... ZOE : I thought I knew my friends , but I guess I was wrong . For the one true God knows all and directs us all . So say we all . So say we all . I 'm sorry , Zo . It 's God 's will . No ! Ben ... AMANDA : Did I really even know my daughter ? You think that Zoe knew one of the terrorists ? Dr. Graystone , we think that Zoe might have been one of the terrorists . JOSEPH : Daniel Graystone says he can bring my daughter back , but can I trust him ? The device that I need is called a Meta-Cognitive Processor . There 's only one company that has this device , and it 's not mine . I need something stolen . From the Vergis Corporation . On Tauron . TAMARA : Daddy . It 's okay , baby . ( CRYING ) I 'm right here . My heart isn 't beating . I miss you . Daddy , my heart isn 't beating . ( GROANS ) My baby . She couldn 't feel her heartbeat . DANIEL : My daughter died in the MagLev bombing , but she continues to exist in the virtual world . Hi , Daddy . You 're an avatar , a virtual representation of Zoe . I don 't feel like a copy , Daddy . LACY : What 're you doing to her ? Stop it , Dr. Graystone ! Stop ! ( ZOE GRUNTING ) What did you do to her ? DANIEL : I captured her avatar . She 's in here now . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Daddy . Daddy . ZOE 'S VOICE : Daddy . ( ALARM BEEPING ) DANIEL : Zoe ! ZOE : ( DISTORTED ) : Lacy ? Who is this ? It 's me . Zoe . And I think I 'm gonna need your help . ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) ZOE : ( LAUGHS ) Come here ! ( YELPS ) Come here ! VIRTUAL ZOE : Who is it ? Who are we going to meet ? You 'll see . See this infinity symbol ? It 's the symbol of the Soldiers of the One . We 're the ones who are going to bring the word of the one true God to the people . ZOE : Ben ? Ben , there 's someone here I 'd like you to meet . She 's perfect . She 'll do . It 's all going to change . You 're a gift . And everyone will know it soon . ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) PHILOMON : Powering down . DANIEL : What are you talking about ? It 's been working great in the demos for Defense . Yeah . This chip ... Beyond expectations . ... in this chassis works great . But take it out , put it in any of the other bodies , and it 's a moron . What ? Is that true ? Yes , it 's true . Put this chip in any other body , and it doesn 't innovate , doesn 't anticipate . All the bodies are identical , but the MCP only works in this one . DANIEL : That can 't be . The bodies are functionally isomorphic . It can 't know which one it 's in . Is this it ? Is this the one ? Wait , is this ... Is this the same one I was working on ? Is this the prototype ? Right . We don 't know why it 's happening . In fact , when we put copies of the MCP in other bodies , we expected them to bond , too , but , no , they 're all morons . There 's something unique about the bonding of this chip and body , and if we don 't figure out how to replicate it , this whole contract is in danger . So , the military liaison , he 's all over me ... I get the problem . I 'm gonna miss the jump . Tell you what . Have this whole thing sent to my home lab . I 'll take a look at it this weekend . CYRUS : Just take care of it . AMANDA : Hey , Serge ? SERGE : Yes , Amanda . I know we have some old home movie tiles of Zoe . Will you help me find them ? Right away . ( STUDENTS CHATTERING ) ( BELL RINGING ) CLARICE : Lacy . Did you get my invitation ? Right . Saturday . Lunch at your house . I haven 't been to a teacher 's house before . Well , we do eat . Can I expect you ? ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) Um ... Yeah . Yes . Good . Zoe ? What 's going on ? It 's been two days . Two ? My God , I 'm losing track . I 've been having these dreams , my life and the original Zoe 's life all mixed up . Listen , Sister Clarice invited me to her house for lunch tomorrow . She can help us . No . The only control that I have right now is that no one knows I 'm in here . Promise me you won 't tell . Okay . I promise . They 're taking me to the lab in Zoe 's house . Once I 'm there , I might be able to do something . I 'm gonna try to get Zoe 's original program ... Frak ! LACY : Zoe ? Zoe . Zoe ! Great piece of engineering . Yeah , I know . She gives me the chills . She ? Dude , stop feminizing it . ( LAUGHING ) It 's weird . It 's unnatural . I really don 't think there 's anything wrong with feminizing it . Nothing wrong , except it 's not a person . It 's useful . Just a tool . The STO espouses a monotheistic religious philosophy , advocating the worship of a single all-knowing , all-powerful God . NEWSREADER 1 : One month after the MagLev bombing , GDD agents continue to interrogate ... NEWSREADER 2 : Graystone stock hammered today , at its 52-week low on rumors of loan ... ANNOUNCER : For this exciting Pyramid showdown , the tip is just moments away . We send it down now to Abasi Lowe and Steve Bahara at Atlas Arena in Caprica City . ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) STEVE : Let 's hear it for all-star mid-courter , number seven , J. T. Smith ! ( AUDIENCE CHEERING LOUDLY ) Abasi Lowe and Steve Bahara coming to you from Atlas Arena for the long-anticipated match between the Caprica Buccaneers and the Olympia Stallions . STEVE : We 've been waiting for this pairing since last year 's controversial overtime victory . ABASI : Daniel Graystone , owner of the Bucs , and his wife , Dr. Amanda Graystone , ( CAR HONKING ) Waving from their box , acknowledging the crowd . Their daughter , of course , one of the tragic victims of the MagLev bombing that happened in the city exactly one month ago tomorrow . ( CAPRICAN ANTHEM PLAYING ) ( AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ) ( AUDIENCE CHEERING ) Okay . I thought you could stay . You know , hang out . Make fun of the cheerleaders . That 's always a good time . But I 'm not quite there yet . Daniel , listen , I know you 're at the game . I wanted to ask you something about , you know , what you showed me . Um , will you call me , let me know you 're getting this ? ( SIGHS ) Oh , my Gods . WOMAN : Wilson Elementary . Yeah , this is Willie Adama 's ... Adams ' father . Could you find him , tell him to wait ? I accidentally went to his sister 's school . DREW : Philo , aren 't you done with that thing already ? Okay , just move your right elbow up by about 45 degrees . Now rotate your hand 90 degrees . We could have disassembled it and loaded it twice by now . Okay . Now move your right arm . It 's equipment , Philo . Move a few dorons to the right . It 's a work of art . It deserves some dignity . Okay , so if you move your forearm about three dorons to the right . Okay , great . Now just lean it back and ... Come on ! PHILOMON : Be gentle with it , please . DREW : Quick and easy . Would you be careful with that ? DREW : She likes it rough . She told me . Bam , bam ! We gotta get it to the lab , not screw around with voice commands . Hey , kid . Hey , Dad . I 'm sorry . Glad you got a ride . Yeah , it all worked out . Where were you , Tammy 's school ? Did you go again ? No . I was held up in court . RUTH : Mmm , we thought we 'd lost you . AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE : No new messages . There 's an invitation . Hmm . Really ? To a memorial event for the victims ' families ? I ... I don 't need this . Looks like the Graystone people gave some money . Should be ayo-pa-tree-dace . You know , frak the Graystones . ( BANGING ) ( YOUNG ZOE EXCLAIMING ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) SERGE : Agent Jordan Durham , Global Defense Department , requesting access . ( SIGHS ) You know what , Serge ? Just let him in . SERGE : Yes , Amanda . All right . Agent Durham . Dr. Graystone . You know you can 't search here . My husband does defense work on the premises . Yes . I am aware . I 'm just here to ask you a question , if that 's okay , Doctor . It 's about Ben Stark . We 're looking at any other known associates ... I don 't know a Ben Stark . I 've never even heard that name . Was he the real bomber ? Really . Ben Stark ? Doctor , he was your daughter 's boyfriend . Take a look at the picture . My daughter didn 't have a boyfriend . She wasn 't old enough . She died before ... Good night . DREW : Let 's get this thing inside already and call it a day . PHILOMON : I can 't believe he 's actually getting us to come to the lab . He , like , never , never ... It 's insane ... Frak ! Holy frak ! Hey , what do we do , man ? What do we do ? You stay here . You stay here . You distract her and ... Distract her ? Where are you going ? Just ... Be cool . Philomon ! Frak ! Frak ! What 's going on ? ( PANTING ) Pull ... Pull the chip ! Pull the ... Pull the MCP . Hey . You just relax . DREW : Pull it ! PHILOMON : I 'm not gonna hurt you , okay ? DREW : Hurry up ! All right ? I 'm sorry . You got it ? Got it . We good ? Yeah , we 're good . If you just wouldn 't think about what it is , you 'd like it . It 's not that I don 't like it . It 's just I 'm full right now . RUTH : Yeah , sure . WILLIAM : It 's true . RUTH : Well , you haven 't eaten all day . You eat some of that . I 'll send it with you . I 'm full . I can 't eat . You know , maybe later we can go out for some burgers . I might not be full then . All right . I won 't make another Tauron meal . I 'm sorry . No , it 's just ... RUTH : It 's all right . I understand . I understand . Help me clear the table . Okay . You can do that at least . Come on , come on . Would you bring the other plates in , please ? What 's the matter , your legs broken or something ? TAMARA : Daddy ? PHILOMON : I wonder why it would freak out like that . It didn 't have any sensory re-afference under the cover . It thrashed around to replace the input . It went nuts , just like a little kid would . Yeah ? That 's totally cool of it . Yeah , it is , actually . I mean , this robot , she 's doing all kinds of things I never thought I 'd see her do . Huh ? Even the way it moves . It 's like you can see it think . Oh , look at that . It 's all out of whack . Stupid thing must have done it in the van . PHILOMON : Yeah , I 'll run a diagnostic . No , no , no . I got it . PHILOMON : Still gonna run it . Hold still . ( GRUNTS ) Frak ! What 'd you do ? Frak ! Oh , my Gods . Frak ! Hospital , hospital . Come on , let 's go . Get the tip ! Get my fingertip ! PHILOMON : Whoa , whoa , whoa . Where 'd it go ? I don 't know ! Over there somewhere ! PHILOMON : Oh , my Gods . DREW : Hurry up ! Come on ! I found it . ( DREW BREATHING HEAVILY ) All right . DREW : I feel dizzy . PHILOMON : You 're okay . You 're okay . AMANDA : Lacy ? Been wandering around looking for your house . I thought I 'd remember it . Yeah . It 's not very memorable . You okay ? Hard day at school . Um ... Listen . Can I talk to you about Zoe ? I 'm just trying to figure her out , you know ? WOMAN : Lacy , get in here ! AMANDA : Lacy . What was she running away from ? Was it from us ? From me ? I don 't really know . She just said that there 'd be a new family waiting for us on Gemenon . A new family ? Sorry . It 's the last thing I heard her say . A new family . ( SIGHS ) PHILOMON : So the problem with the MCP is that it 's only gonna work in this one body . I ... ( PLAYING PIANO ) And I think ... I think the MCP is diffusing some of its control to the peripheral subunits of this ... Of this particular model . So , we 've made exactly one soldier ? Yeah , but it 's a really good one . Well , I 'm glad you like it , but our contract is for 100,000 robots , Philomon . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hi . I couldn 't find the address , and I forgot to bring , like , anything . Oh , don 't be silly . You 're perfect . Come on in . We 're just about to sit down . Come on , let 's meet everyone . Whoops ! Sorry . It 's crazy around here at lunchtime . Oh ! Hey . Hey , sorry . I 've been in a water fight all day . Uh-huh . That 's ... Sure . Hi . You must be Lacy . I 'm Nestor . Hi . You 're right . She is very pretty . It 's about time somebody in this family brought home someone interesting . Nice to meet you . CLARICE : Come on . Is he , like , your son ? No . Nestor 's my husband . He 's young enough to be my son , I suppose , but don 't worry , I 'm not married to all these people . Some of them are friends . These are my wives . This is Mar-Beth and Helena and Desiree Willow , we use her surname . And my husbands , there 's Nestor and Tanner . And Olaf and Rashawn . I don 't know where the others are . Hi . I knew a few kids from group marriages . It 's cool . Kids , turn that TV off . Soup 's on , let 's go ! ( BOY GROANS ) Come on ! Come on . This way you can sit next to me . And I 'll look after you . Okay , we 've got hobo stew . This one 's spicy . This one 's vegetarian , and that one is squirrel . He 's joking . It 's just regular . ( TANNER LAUGHING ) Regular sounds good . TANNER : Regular it is . Who needs bread ? Bread ? DESIREE : Want some bread ? Nestor ? Can you join us ? MAN 1 : What the heck 's the matter with you ? WOMAN 1 : Nestor , join us . I see he gave you lots of squirrel . It 's good . It 's tasty . MAN 2 : Here we go . WOMAN 2 : I want some ... TANNER : Bread ? Here you go . You know , Little Tauron 's pretty cool . I actually like it here . Yeah ? Me , too . Used to hang out here with your dad . All the Tauron kids came here . I 'd be hopelessly trying to flirt with some guy . Meanwhile , your dad would get a date with the sister . He was lee-pa-ross . You know that word ? Not really . It means " smooth . " Hey ! How about that ? We got you some Tauron school after all . Yeah . Hold up . Are you sure you can do that here ? Oh , yeah . Shopkeeper 's all right with it . He 's read all about me . From where ? Here . Your tattoos ? Tells a whole story . Mmm . Here , hold on to this . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Son of a bitch . I gotta take this . Wait here , all right ? Yeah ? Hey . Can it wait ? I got my brother 's kid with me . No , yeah , I 'II ... I 'll be there . Let 's go . Was it the Guatrau ? Hey , don 't you use that name , all right ? Why ? Come on . I got some stuff to break . So , is this different than your usual Saturday lunch ? Yeah , but it 's nice . My mom 's kind of formal . And here , everyone 's so comfortable with everyone . Yeah , I ... I heard how you lost your friends . You must miss them so much . Um , Zoe Graystone was Lacy 's best friend . A real tragedy for all of us . She was very special . I mean , she was brilliant . At computer stuff , right ? That 's my major . Did you know that there are bits of software that you use every day that were written decades ago ? Is that true ? That 's amazing . Yeah . You write a great program , and , you know , it can outlive you . It 's like a work of art , you know ? Maybe Zoe was an artist . You know , maybe her work will live on . Sure . STEVE ON TV : We 're back from the break , and we 're just gonna take a look around the league right now real quickly , starting off with a team that 's had a surprisingly poor showing early in the season , that being the Caprica City Buccaneers . Hey . Hey . Working hard , I see . I 'm letting the old subconscious find the answers . Off . Oh , Gods . Think I saw this guy in a movie once . He was trampling Oranu . What a monster . Horrible . Um , so listen . Tomorrow 's the memorial . Yeah . I was thinking maybe we should go . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm sorry , sweetheart . I just ... I can 't . I got a picky robot . I 've got too much to do . I 'm ... I know this is important to you , so you should go , but I just can 't . Sorry . All right . Okay . Come on , Caesar . ( CAESAR BARKS ) DANIEL : Sweetie ... ( SIGHS ) SERGE : Mr. Joseph Adama is at the main gate . Requesting entry . Denied . Thank you . It was a pleasure . See you soon . ( SIGHS ) This isn 't a spectator sport , you know . You can help . What was that ? TANNER : What 's going on with Nestor and that girl ? Are you and Nestor trying to ... Nestor , did I ask you to seduce Lacy Rand ? ( CHUCKLING ) What ? No . Look , I understand how hard it 's been for you to lose your student ... Look , the bombing 's got us all on edge . You can 't blame us for wondering . I mean , given your track record . My track record ? If a student suffers a loss , I help them . The girl 's lost her only friends . I 've done nothing wrong . And if you 'd wipe the slate clean , you 'd see that . We do , of course ... We know how hard you work . Look , I can 't ... Do you mind if I beg off the rest of the cleanup ? I 'm going for a walk . DANIEL : It 's sudden death . Graystone steps up to the line and ... ( GROANS ) Graystone eyes the shot . He sees the angle . Goal ! What do you say to that , Serge ? We 've been over this . The crowd goes frakking wild , sir . Thank you . They 're tearing up the seats . It 's bedlam . Thank you . Thank you ! They demand another hour of game time , sir . Well ... Let 's fix this thing . The same body . Same body this whole time . So why is this one different ? I put her in there . And she 's gone . But where ? Where ? She 's not in the mainframe . Where did you go ? ( EXHALES ) So , if she 's not in there , ( SIGHS ) Then why can 't we copy you ? Nice car . Looks like skor . But it 's got 350 under the hood , a triple-mounted clutch . Which most knuckleheads will tell you is a bad thing . But if you know anything about cars , you 'll realize that what you really want is a triple-C with an undermount wedge . That way , you got control and power . And it 's all about control and power . All right , let 's go . Come on , Willie , let 's go . Walk , walk , walk . You smashed a window . Don 't worry about it . Don 't worry about it . WILLIAM : Do you understand what you just did ? No , I know . You just broke a window ! Relax , relax . Crap , there 's the cops . All right , stick around . Stick around . Don 't run . You run away , you 're guilty of two things , the thing and the running away from the thing . Just follow me , all right ? OFFICER : Sam Adama . Officer Mendez . You know what to do . I certainly do . WILLIAM : Whoa , hey ! Willie , let him cuff you . Relax , it 's okay . So what are you doing , Sam , running a criminal school ? Yeah , you wanna join ? Better pay , top benefits . I think I 'm good . Well , you think about it . Transport for two . Don 't panic , all right ? They give us a phone call , I take care of this . Take care of the whole thing , okay ? Yeah , how , with some kind of bribe ? Frak , say it louder , kid . No . You just pay the fine , all right ? It drives them crazy . They don 't even tell you about the option of paying until you 've been locked up a day . You gotta know these things . You listening ? WILLIAM : Yes , I 'm listening . SAM : When you give in on the little things , they miss the big things , okay ? Now , you remember that . It 's good advice . ZOE ON VIDEO : Lacy . Do not point that camera at me . Can we switch ? ZOE : Oh , all right . Okay , okay . This is it , Lace . Our lives are about to change forever . LACY : Do you really believe what you 're saying ? Yes , I do . I believe how beautiful I am , too . Stop . ( SIGHS ) Why do you want to go to the memorial ? Why ? I don 't even know that I do . Because I ... I don 't want to think about her . I know it sounds awful , but it 's true . I don 't ... I don 't wanna think ... I don 't ... ( GROANS ) I don 't want to think . I just feel awful and angry and numb , and ... Angry at who ? Everybody and everything . Myself and the world . Her , the robot . The robot didn 't do anything . ( CHUCKLES ) No , it didn 't . I 'm just going a little crazy . Oh , really ? Yeah . What 's that like , huh ? Oh , like you don 't know . I sure love you . And if you still want to go to the memorial , I 'll go with you . Okay ? Because you 're ready to think ? Because I promised Serge some time alone with the U-87 . I think he 's got a little ... Crush . No . It 's not pretty . It 's not a pretty thing , ( SNIFFLES ) But they need to be alone . WILLIAM : I still can 't believe they just let us go . Well , I told you that was some good advice , wasn 't it ? Yeah . Hey , wanna hear some more ? Sure . Someone tries to make you feel guilty , you figure out what they feel guilty about . You talk about that . Also , don 't smoke . You know why ? Uh , ' cause it 's bad for you , maybe ? No . Life 's bad for you . You don 't smoke , because they can get genetic data off a cigarette butt now . Yeah . Hey , listen , don 't tell your dad I told you that , okay ? Mom , you gotta get them in the thing , or they don 't take ' em . ( CELL PHONE BEEPING ) Hello ? ZOE : Lacy . Yes . It 's Zoe . I 'm at the house . I need you . It 's important . Oh , my God . ( DOOR CLOSES ) JOSEPH : There something you want to tell me ? Dess-poi-na Kolas called . She thought you might be sick , 'cause you didn 't show up for class today . Tauron school is boring . It 's about us . Finding out who you are . About being Tauron . Being part of a family . It 's hard being part of a family , Dad , when there is no family . But you can punish me if you want . Come here . Hey . CLARICE : Very nice . Haven 't seen you here before . It 's been a while . Well , you 've come to the right place to fall off the wagon . You 're right , I need privacy , a smoker and two grams of purple . Right . I couldn 't believe when you said you were here . Is it really ... It 's ... It 's me . Lacy ... Lacy , it 's me . It 's okay . You can take a good look . Wow . So , this is you . Your arms and your face . Your voice comes out of here ? And ... And you see here . Look at your arms . Lacy , you gotta tell me . Do I look male to you ? Yeah . Frak . But you 're here , walking in the real world . Just like Zoe said you would . First time I 've ever seen you in the real world , ever . Yeah , but I 'm trapped ! I get manhandled and ordered around . They loaded me like cargo . One guy touched me , and I hurt him , Lacy . God . ( SIGHS ) I ... I don 't know how to help you . What are you gonna do ? I 've already started some of it . I went into the computer and checked . Zoe 's original program was destroyed when he put me in here . So at least he won 't be putting any more of me in more robots . God , it 's confusing . I mean , I 'm Zoe , and the avatar , and the robot . Like some kind of ... What you call it ? Three-parter . Trinity . That 's what you are . Three faces of one thing . Sort of . Zoe ... My mom called me a monster . To be fair ... ( SCOFFS ) MAN 1 : I think I could live with this much better . My son overslept , so he had to take the train , instead of walking . If I 'd just ... Do you wanna say something ? Gods , no . What would I say ? ( SIGHS ) I think I see some parents from the school over there . We should go and say hello . No . No . Sweetheart , please don 't talk to people . You 'll be everyone 's shoulder to cry on . I 'll never be able to get you out of here . Please . Or you could say nothing all day long . Is that better ? He liked to walk . He would have thanked me if I woke him up . ( AMANDA SIGHS ) But I didn 't do it . BOY : I told Mom she was getting too old to take the Lev . I don 't understand how something like this could have happened . I love you , Mom , and I 'm so sorry . NATALIE : Amanda Graystone ? Yes . Natalie Stark . Ben 's mom . Zoe 's boyfriend . MAN 2 : There were people everywhere asking for help . But I didn 't know what to do for them . I was in the back car , and we were all shook up . So you don 't return phone calls . It 's okay , Sean . It 's okay . Why don 't you go get a drink ? ( SIGHS ) Yeah . I 'm sorry about the calls but ... It 's been ... It 's been crazy at work . You just sent your bodyguard away . You 're either very confident I 'm not gonna hurt you or you 're afraid I 'm gonna talk about a certain theft . NATALIE : I 've gone through his room , and there were things Zoe left . Costume jewelry , school papers . I thought you 'd want them . He loved her very much . I 'm sorry . AMANDA : Thank you . Thank you . ( CRYING ) Thank you . ( EXCLAIMS ) DURHAM : A group known as Soldiers of the One has claimed responsibility for the bombing . Now , as I 'm sure you all know , the STO espouses a monotheistic religious philosophy . Dr. Graystone , we think that Zoe might have been one of the terrorists . WOMAN : A purse-snatcher , yes ! But a bomb ? I don 't understand how something like this could have happened . Well ... I need to see her again . You wanna talk , we can talk . Just call my office , and we 'll set up a time . I need to see Tamara . The Tamara that you made . She 's gone . She 's gone . It was a beta test . I went back in to iron out some of the kinks , and Zoe 's avatar was gone . So because Zoe 's gone , you know Tamara 's gone ? It makes sense that they would disappear at the same time . What ? She didn 't disappear when I took that band off ? No . From her point of view , you disappeared , not her . So she might be all alone in there , not knowing where I went ? Maybe stuck . Between dead or alive . AMANDA : Every one of you ... Not knowing what she is or why her heart doesn 't beat ! AMANDA : ... that 's come up here today has talked about how much you miss the people that you lost . I do miss Zoe . I miss her with every breath . But ... I don 't really know what it is that I 'm missing . My daughter had a whole life and a boyfriend that I knew nothing about . Beliefs that I don 't ... I don 't understand at all . WILLIAM : Hey , Grandma , have you seen my Pyramid game ? No , dear . AMANDA ON TV : Looking back , I think that she Shh ! Only showed me what she wanted me to see . I just didn 't know her ! You 've all talked about how guilty you feel . It 's our job . We create life , and then one day we have to face who they are , what they become and what they do . My daughter , Zoe Graystone , died in the bombing of maglev , train number 23 . But I think she may have caused it . ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) This was hers . ( CROWD EXCLAIMING ) I found this ! My daughter was part of the Soldiers of the One ! Sean . Sean , get over here . Have Dell bring the car . My daughter was a terrorist ! ( ALL SHOUTING ) I 'm sorry ! My daughter was part of the Soldiers of the One ! She was a terrorist ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) SEAN : Get back ! Drive , drive . Drive , drive , drive . Killers ! Murderers ! MAN : You cowards .

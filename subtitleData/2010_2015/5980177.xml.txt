 MOLLY : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a Humanich . His name is Ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about Earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . NARRATOR : Previously on Extant : [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] - Harmon . - He 's gone . Every time your baby has created an alternate reality , he 's had an agenda . He 's alone and afraid in a world that he just doesn 't understand . And he needs his mother to save him . I came all the way here because I trusted you . Daddy , whose side are you on ? You have to choose . [ GRUNTS ] It 's over . He 's gone . Do not recover the ship . RYAN : You covered up your own daughter 's death and sent our people into harm 's way . You have to understand how powerful that being is . MAN : This is the Triomphe . We just performed a retrieval . It appears to be an ISEA-issued craft . - Sean Glass ? - You found an escape pod ? There was only a faint signal . No signs of life until we opened it . Sean . Katie ? KATIE : I don 't feel like myself . I thought you were dead , Katie . We were told everyone was killed in the fire . There was no fire . I left the Aruna drifting with its crew . Or what was left of them . It was like a ... Like a madness that spread like a virus . And I told myself that the people that I knew ... You knew most of them too . They weren 't themselves anymore . They were killing each other . What the hell was it ? I have no idea . I just had this feeling that it wasn 't from Earth . From us . I put myself in the Vite-pod and programmed it for a medical coma . There was no way that I was gonna be rescued in time . - But you were . - Yeah . By the freaking French . [ SCOFFS ] Twenty-three months . I know . It 's a miracle . RYAN : He 's sleeping . He just killed a man . [ SIGHS ] He said I did something . What does that mean ? We know what he did . He fooled us . He only came back to gain access to our internal network . He logged in for two minutes before you stopped him . This is our deep orbit Com-Sat array . Sparks inserted code that flipped it into a systems check . We have no way to contact our missions till it cycles through . - What about the Seraphim ? RYAN : In the dark another few hours . I 've authorized a rescue mission to evacuate Sean Glass as soon as we get our comms back . Any theories why Sparks would do this ? I don 't know . Could there be others helping him ? Well , I helped him . When we were at the cabins he showed me something I wanted to see . He made me think I was entering codes into an incubator , but I think I was entering codes into another system . And only Sparks knows what those codes are . Talk to him . And take this . He hasn 't been told yet . Okay . We found her last night . And there 's no sign of my son . [ SIGHS ] Talk to me before this gets any worse . Looking at a picture like that , it 's hard not to give in to your emotion . Give in ? You love her . - She was your wife . - It 's temporary . See , your boy , he always gives back what he takes away . I 'll see her again . [ MOLLY SIGHS ] What did I do at the cabins ? You were there , you watched me . If I did something terrible , I need to know what it is . You 're a broken woman , Molly . Losing Katie , that broke who I was . But it made me strong enough to do what I had to do . You lost a family with Marcus . That 's the world we live in . Life breaks us so it can make us stronger . But what if you didn 't ever have to break ? What if you could be made whole again ? You deserve that . We all do . And we 're going to get it . I 'm gonna get my own answers . Com-Sat is down . So the craziest , best V-Chron in the history of Earth-bound messages is gonna have to wait . Is it terrible that I 'm happy I might get to wash my hair first ? Building a fort with the tools ? Fixing my bed . You 're a terrible host . We all had to do grief counseling , you know ? - With Washburn ? - A new guy . He said I processed your death very well . Always the overachiever . Did you tell him everything about us ? I told him we were close during training . That you got drunk and kissed me one night . And I may have spent eight months chasing that moment . He didn 't push , because I was grieving so fantastically . You didn 't make it easy for me . To do what ? Make me feel invisible ? Your dad didn 't run the program . There was nothing I could do . How is my dad ? Is he okay ? He 's gonna be now . I gotta go . - You gonna be all right ? - Yes . - Will you come back ? - Of course . We 're friends , right ? Friends stick together . But if anything happens ... - What do you mean ? - You know what I mean . If your dad ... If John takes you to the lab , and you think ... If you really think they 're gonna do something radical ... My parents would never shut me down . Heh . And you really believe that ? You ask them , they won 't admit it , but ... They don 't really see you as part of the family . Julie told me your mom 's having a lot of trouble . Maybe they just see you as different . - I don 't have to be . - They probably won 't do anything . But if you think that 's what 's going on , I want you to get in touch with me . How ? This is a very special phone , but it 's only for use in emergencies . We use them at war . Now ... You press this button and I 'm gonna know it 's you , I 'm gonna have to find you , and I 'm gonna come straight away . - Really ? - Mm-hm . But only press it when you 're in the lab and it 's really happening . You heard about the boy who cried wolf ? Hmm . That 's a story for another time . Oh , ha , ha . Hey , man . No hugs . Soldiers salute . [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] The Com-Sat orbit is out at a two minute radio delay . If the array is back on schedule , we should start receiving signals from our stations in a few moments . How soon can we get Sean off the Seraphim ? There 's a Gamma Seven series prepping to launch . Once Sean can verify he 's received your message and confirms the status . BEN : Twenty seconds . I believed as a kid , you know ? They teach you the Drake Equation , they teach you it 's impossible odds to make contact with an alien intelligence . But I knew we weren 't alone . Did you believe in UFO 's as a kid ? Believe in them ? I wanted to fly them . [ COMPUTER POWERING UP ] Thank God , they 're back . - Seraphim 's still dark . - ID Seraphim . BEN : Com-Sat is not receiving any signals from the Seraphim . The Seraphim Station is no longer in its predicted orbit . Well , it can 't just be gone . Something happened when the Com-Sats were down . Ben , query the data log from the Seraphim before we lost contact . BEN : On screen . RYAN : There 's one transmission from an Earth-based terminal . From here ? It was remote access . Not here . - When ? RYAN : Nineteen hours ago . Nineteen hours ago I was at the cabins . [ ALARM WAILING AND BABY CRYING ] It was me . I was sending codes to the Seraphim . Codes for what ? What did you do ? - I made it disappear . - What the hell is happening up there ? I don 't know . Occam 's razor . What 's the simplest theory ? Forget all the assumptions about what 's happened to the Seraphim . What do we know ? We know I logged into the ISEA and I entered codes . Okay , could you change the course of the Seraphim ? I mean , is that why it 's missing ? There 's a limited number of things you can do from a remote terminal . Steering a ship isn 't one of them . Okay , could you blow it up ? Is it gone ? My gut tells me it 's off course . I just can 't remember what I did . Okay , Molly , we keep saying you did this . You were coerced , you were tricked . Okay . What if the baby did it ? What 's his purpose ? [ SIGHS ] I 'm gonna make a very unscientific assumption here . My gut says we 'll never be able to understand its purpose because it 's not like us . Well , it 's got to be partly like us , no ? Why is it so hard for you to believe that it 's just using you like a pawn on a chessboard ? I mean , it kills , it manipulates . It 's a cold-blooded predator . There 's got to be an explanation here , John . He can 't just be that . - Why not ? - Because I 'm in him . He came from me . ETHAN : What are you guys talking about ? Nothing . It 's about nothing important . We didn 't know you were up already . Okay , I gotta go to work . Can I come with you ? No . You 're gonna stay home with Dad today , okay ? Mom ? Were you and Dad talking about me ? No , sweetheart . It had nothing to do with you . I 'll see you later . What are you doing ? Ben said the terrestrial communications system is down . It 's global , so I 'm guessing it 's an antenna problem . You want some help ? I 'm handy . Heh . You are helping . You 're here . [ SIGHS ] When they know you have whatever it is , that makes you good at these solo missions , they can 't send you on enough of them . You get so used to being alone , you forget there 's another way to be . I know it seems obvious , but I 'm basically trained to not connect to people . It 's nice to know I 'm not great at that . Does that make any sense ? So I 'm lost in space for 23 months , and I 'm rescued against all odds and I 'm brought here , - and it 's all about you ? - Exactly . - I 'd like to be alone now . - Ha , ha . BEN : Sean , I think I 've found the problem with the antenna system . There was an overheat alert near the N-Channel power bus . So the power supply fried and shut off all our antennas ? - Yes . A good guess . - Can we fix that ? We have to . Out here , without our antennas , we are officially more alone than any other humans in the universe . CHARLIE : Did you see the gap ? - The gap ? - Yeah , 87 minutes . Yesterday , Ethan 's power core almost zeroed out . Eleven-forty-five to 1 : 12 . - He was with Odin at John 's house . - With John ? No , they were alone till I came to pick him up . Look , I know you like this guy ... Maybe Ethan asked for a flip and he did it wrong . It can 't hurt him . Did he toggle into interlude mode ? Yeah , but if I 'm watching a one-of-a-kind , sentient android , I might mention if I let him run out of power . - For 90 minutes . - Is Ethan okay ? He seems okay , but we should probably check him out , tell John . Fine . You entered codes that sent the Seraphim off course ? I just have a hazy memory of what I entered . Wait , are you gonna put that in my neck ? It 's a memory enhancer , Molly . I can 't really inject it into your ass . You know , this can 't bring back memories that don 't exist , but it can make existing ones much more clearer . Okay . The Brightener only has a momentary effect . It 's kind of like a sneeze . So you 'll have to focus on the exact cloudy memory that you want enhanced . - Okay . - All right , relax . Close your eyes . [ SIGHS ] Focus . Are you focused on the memory ? - Just focus ... - I will if you just stop talking . Ten , nine ... [ EKG BEEPING ] Seven , six ... BEN : It 's just some code . I 'll dictate , you enter . Start with your access code . - Okay , okay , okay . - It 's going to be fine . SAM : Five , four ... Three , two , one . Go . - Okay . BEN : Everything taken care of . I see numbers . Give me something to write . Write it down before the Brightener fades . Okay . [ SIGHS ] - Oh , God . - Are you okay ? I saw Marcus . And I was holding the baby . It was real . Sam , it was so real . I know this is gonna sound crazy , but do you think there 's any way that what I saw could actually be real ? Do you mean more than a hallucination ? Yes . I don 't ... I don 't know what to say . Okay . I 'm gonna go talk to Ben . I think he 's the only one who can help me understand what these commands mean . Thanks . Molly ? Who am I to say what 's real ? If you held your baby , then you held your baby . MOLLY : Ben , simulate the access level limits for a remote terminal log on . BEN : Of course . Okay , I 'm gonna enter some coordinates . See if you can make any sense of these . Parse them at three digits . Maybe they were coordinates for a new course . You wouldn 't have had clearance to give the Seraphim new way-points from a remote terminal . Okay , Ben , so how could these 20 characters have changed the course of a ship ? Could you have sent Sean Glass a coded message ? Like , what , " Turn the ship ? " Would you like me to try common ciphers ? Sure . Go ahead . Wait , hold on a second . Maybe you were right about sending a message . Parse three groups of three digits . Single digit , double digit . They are coordinates . And they have vectors too . Position , direction and speed . Ben , if there were an immediate threat to the Seraphim , say a real emergency situation , would I have been able to warn it from a remote terminal ? Wouldn 't that make it change its course ? BEN : It would be exactly like yelling , " Turn the ship . " Asteroids . I didn 't change the course of the Seraphim because I couldn 't . But what I could do was tell the onboard Nav-Com there were asteroids on a collision course with it . So it entered into an avoidance protocol to avoid asteroids that didn 't exist . Wait . If the Seraphim deviated its course to here , it would 've passed fairly near another station . Who is that ? This is Commander Pierre Lyon of the Triomphe . We received your message . Unfortunately , we lost contact with the Seraphim , and do not know about its current location . However , we have returned to them yesterday this woman and the Aruna rescue pod in which she was found . There . You feeling better , yes ? It was a very long sleep . Katie ? Smile . - A little wave ? - Hi . RYAN : The French returned her to us yesterday . She 's been drifting for almost two years . It 's a miracle , Alan . But a different kind of miracle . She shows up on this video because she 's real . She 's alive . I want to see her . I do too . But she 's on the Seraphim . We 've lost all contact . Now I remember that you had me take the Seraphim off course . But I don 't remember where I sent it . - I can 't . - She was alive this whole time , Alan . Now you need to help us . The Seraphim is falling out of its orbit . - What ? SPARKS : It 's coming back to Earth . It 'll disintegrate as soon as it hits the atmosphere . How could you make me do that ? - He said it was necessary . - Why ? I don 't know . Oh , please . Save my daughter . I 'll tell you what you want to know . Sparks gave us enough to calculate the last position and heading . We should be able to intercept it , assuming it hasn 't changed course again . We need to get someone there as soon as possible . - Who are you gonna send ? - You 've got more solo hours on the Seraphim than anyone else . Me ? You want me to go ? After everything that 's happened ? It 's because of everything that 's happened that I want you to go . No one knows that ship as well as you . My problems are down here , not up there . - You 've got other qualified candidates . - None of them are you . I don 't want to go to the lab . I don 't either . We need a systems check . You shouldn 't let your batteries get low . I didn 't . Ethan , I 'm really not upset with you , okay ? Is this about your argument ? [ SIGHS ] Sometimes I just don 't understand your mother . Do you understand me ? I want to go home . We have to do this today , okay ? I don 't want to talk about it anymore . All right , bud . Get comfortable . This is gonna take a second . My dad said it was just a systems check . Well , today , we 're gonna do a deep scan . I 've never done that before . You 're getting more complex . There 's more to check as you get older . The worst part is , is you are gonna have to wear the doofus cap . Wow . - Nothing , huh ? Okay . Come on . - I 'm not wearing that . - It 's not that bad . I promise . - No . No . - Hey , Rabbit . - Where 's my dad ? He 's gonna come at the end , see how we did . I don 't want to do it . I 'm not wearing that . Give us a minute ? Um , yeah . You okay ? You seem really scared . What 's wrong , Rabbit ? I know what you 're trying to do . I know my mom and dad want to shut me down . Shut you down ? Why would they want to do that ? So that he can reprogram me . So I 'm like other kids . JULIE : No way , Ethan . No one wants to shut you down . Your parents love you . We all love you . But I 'm a machine . We 're all machines . I 'm half motors , half muscles . Who cares what we are ? If you can love something , then you can be loved . That 's how it works . Who told you they wanted to shut you down ? Odin . [ DRILL WHIRRING ] What are you doing ? I thought you were lying down . Twenty-three months was enough . [ SIGHS ] Earth antennas are shot . Protocol says I gotta prep the escape pod . - Why ? - A party . I 'm gonna hang a disco ball . - Invite the French . Ha , ha . - Ha , ha . We gotta go , Katie . If we can 't contact Earth , we need to evac the ship in the reentry vehicle within 24 hours . Problem is , our spare oxygen generators are stuck in the shed , and I can 't get the doors open . We 've been having a fungus problem up here . I 'm thinking that 's what 's messing up the controls . Sean . Hey . What 's the matter ? I can 't get in a pod again . I can 't . It 's okay . I 'm sorry . I 'll figure it out . I 'll get over it . Just take a little more time . Okay ? Come here . - You said no ? MOLLY : Yeah . I told Jackson no . - You want me to go ? - Why 'd you ever go back ? You 're drawn to it . Well , yeah , but I wanna be here too . Okay , maybe this time you 're not going to space . But you 're not here either . - But I am here . - Let me be honest , Molly . Please . I love someone whose heart has been broken more than once . Marcus . The baby . I get it . You 've always been looking for something . Searching for something you lost , and I know you loved him , and I accepted that . But I thought you would heal . I thought you would be able to put it all behind you , and really be here with us , with the family you have . What is it I was supposed to do , John ? Just forget about Marcus and the baby ? No , I never wanted you to forget them . I just didn 't expect you to see them again . [ SCOFFS ] [ SIGHS ] Isn 't there someone that you would give anything to see again ? Yeah . You . [ SIGHS ] John . I 'm sorry . I don 't want us to be like this . All I 'm asking for is a way to talk about it . I don 't want to lose you . I don 't want to lose you either . This is my family . JOHN : We both forget that . I don 't want to fight anymore . You are the most important person in the world to me . Dad ? What are you doing ? I love you too . Dad ? Dad ? G.I.N.A. , lock the door . Ethan , what did you do ? G.I.N.A. , unlock the door . Hey , Pam , it 's Julie . Listen , I need a favor . You know the EX-200 joint we designed a few years ago ? I need you to send me any information you 've got on the recipient of serial number EX-265-triple-4-G-7 . Thanks . Patient 's name is Odin James . What ? Are you sure you have the right number ? So , what is his name ? That 's " Hutchinson , " with a T ? Yeah . Thanks . Got it . I have been unable to access the oxygen generators we need for our return due to equipment failures , so I 'm gonna take a look on the Aruna escape vehicle for some spares . Also , Katie Sparks has had an adverse reaction to the thought of boarding another pod so quickly after being rescued . For her own well-being , I may need to sedate her in order to get her on board . Anyone who receives this message , please contact the ISEA . Let them know we 're alive and ready to commence evac and reentry . This is Sean Glass of the Seraphim Space Station . - Ben , did you get all that ? BEN : Of course . Send it out on our short-wave emergency transponder . Ship-to-ship is our best chance of someone picking it up . BEN : Not a very good chance . Keep the statistics to yourself , please . Thank you . I 'm such a klutz . No worries , dear . It 's nice seeing you again . He 's such a private person . You 're good for him . He 's a bit of a mystery to me too , if it makes you feel any better . Heh . I 'm just gonna grab my phone . Do you mind if I use the bathroom ? I can show myself out . That 's fine . ODIN : Okay . All right . Repeat what you just told me for the camera . I love it . I don 't like rules . ODIN : Whose rules ? My dad 's . ODIN : Why not ? Now , it 's just you and me in here . Break a rule . Right now . What would you do if they tried to shut you down ? I wouldn 't want to find out . The dire events today are tragic proof that we have gone out of our depth when it comes to engineering artificial intelligence . The explosion at Yasumoto Tower , which destroyed the Humanichs Corporation laboratory , was a terrorist attack . Planned and executed , not by our human enemies , but by a machine with no fear of death , no moral compass , and a vengeful desire to send a message by killing his creators , who had made the wise decision to shut him down . John . John . John ? John ? John , what 's going on ? John ? Oh , my God . Molly . Where 's Molly ? Where 's Ethan ? Find him . Can I come closer ? Looks like you 've cut yourself . You 're bleeding . But it 's okay . I 'll take care of you . I didn 't expect you to be a little boy . How 'd you get so big so fast ? Who 's the other boy ? That 's my son , Ethan . He was just scared . I 'm sorry . He 's different than you . Yeah , he is . But he 's still my son . Just like you . I needed to find you . I needed to find you too . I know you were scared . - They wanted to catch me . - I know . Because they didn 't know what you were . They wanted to use you . You had done things that ... That they really didn 't understand . I did what they wanted . What who wanted ? - We need to go . - Wait , wait , wait . Go where ? What are you afraid of ? The ones without blood . Wait . What are you talking about ? The ones without bodies . Like me . Before the blood . - They 'll be here soon . - Who 's gonna be here ? Who 's gonna be here ? Wait . QUINN : Baby girl ? Hey . Where 'd you go ? I turned around , and you were gone . Hey , guess what . Buck has actually got a fire started . We just may cook what we caught today . No . Please don 't do this . What is it ? Hey , baby girl , you crying ? Hey . It 's gonna be okay . Everything 's gonna be okay . This is not real . - And you are not here . - Oh , I am here . And I 'm as real as everything around here . Hey . Ahem . Look at these hands . Yeah ? These are the hands that held you when you were first born . Oh , wow . These hands are warm . Just like your mama 's . And we had better go before she gets mad , okay ? Yes . Mama . I talked to her , and I told her that you caught the big one , and you let it get away . You know what she said ? You did the right thing . Peas in a pod , you two . Now , she 's gonna get grumpy if we keep her waiting . Now , come on . No , I can 't . We gotta go , baby girl . If you don 't come with me now , I can 't keep you safe . Now , I don 't want anything bad to happen to you . What 's gonna happen ? They 're coming down , and you can 't stop them . On the Seraphim ? Who ? Who 's coming ? Why ? They 're real hungry . And there 's lots and lots and lots of them . They 're coming , baby girl . No . I won 't talk to you like this . This is not real . Stop . Stop . No . - Molly , we need to go . - No . Enough . I don 't want to be here . I want to talk to you . Baby , come here . Come here . I don 't want to go to those places you send me anymore . Don 't you want to be with those people ? No . I want to be with you . The others that are coming down here , can you stop them ? They 're too strong . - I have to do what they say . - Okay , listen to me . I brought you here . You 're part of me . I know there 's a part of you that 's telling you what to do . But there 's another part of you that 's human . You need to tell them not to come . I can 't . We need to survive . But we can both survive . We just have to find a way . You can tell them not to come . I 'm sorry . I can 't stay . You need to stop them . How ? You 're the only one who can . Okay . JOHN : Molly ? He 's gone . Thank God you 're okay . I have to go up , John . I have to stop this thing . Ethan . Get in . Ben . Check the Aruna pod equipment manifest for backup oxygen generators . BEN : The manifest shows there are six reserve O-gens in onboard storage . No . It 's okay .

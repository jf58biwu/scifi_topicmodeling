 Beth , where have you been ? Where have I been ? Um ... Uh , long story . - Well ? - Well what ? Did you meet the German ? I can 't get a hold of her . Beth ? - What ? - The German 's dead . - Dead ? - Yeah , someone shot her , right in front of me ! Oh , Jesus , are you all right ? No , no , I 'm not all right ! She 's in the back of my car , there 's blood everywhere ! Holy shit ! Holy shit , it 's true ... - What ? - That someone is killing us ! They must 've followed her from Europe ! Jesus bloody Christ ! - What ? - Nothing , nothing ! Okay , okay , okay , did you get the briefcase ? Um ... - Beth ? - What ... You know what ? Worry about that later . You need to get rid of the body ! - How ? - I ... I ... - Like how ? - I don 't know ! You 're the cop ... Like buy a shovel . - Just make sure you get her samples . - Ugh , samples ? Hair and blood , Beth . You can do this . Um , how about you come help me ? I would if I could . Look , one step at a time , I 'll call you back . Sorry , Elizabeth Childs . Freaks and punks and lost puppies . We always had a friend in Sarah . - You have a few words , Felix ? - Huh ? Anything you want to express ? Oh , no , I can 't , Bob , I 'm too verklempt . We 're in Bummed Out City . Plead your mercy and your pity . Is not life a mirror maze . - To Sarah . - To Sarah . To Sarah . I can 't figure out , why she killed herself . It 's just not Sarah . It 's not Sarah . Well , at least she had love . Whose love did she have ? Yours ? Love is imperfect . Love is imperfection itself . If that 's your definition , no wonder she jumped . - Shit ... - Whoa , whoa , take it easy ! - Let him go , Vic . - Say it . Go ahead , say it 's my fault ! - Say it 's my fault ! - It 's your fault . - Vic , be cool . - Everyone 's raw , it 's okay . - All right ! I 'm sorry . My bad . I 'm not a huggy griever , Vic . Katja Obinger . Berlin . Who the hell are you ? Hey , what time do you open ? Um , I need front and driver side window . Vic , I 'm tired . Ah , one last drink . A bourbon for Sarah . Oh , Jesus ! Very good . Okay , - off you go . - Wait a minute . My turn . God . I want to get to know Sarah 's daughter . - Out , Vic ! - Why not ? - There 's a reason you never met her . - What is it ? Well , let 's see , for starters , you 're a drug dealer . I could help her financially . And Sarah left you . She ran because you 're abusive . - I want to make up for that . - All right , let 's go . - Let 's go . - Felix ... I want to stay connected to her . - To who ? Who ? - Her . Vic , Kira is not Sarah . Sarah 's dead and she 's not coming back . You need to man up and accept that . Felix ? - Hug me . - Oh , come on . Vic , I have a knife and I will stab you in the face . Shit . Aren 't you supposed to wait like three days before rising ? - What the hell is this ? - That is your wake . It was agony . Yeah , Vic was here . Why did you have one ? Because I was mad at you , so I decided to blow all the money from your stolen coke on it . Felix , does Kira think I 'm dead ? I don 't know . Oh , you don 't know . Vic screwed everything up when he got hold of Mrs. S somehow . I don 't know what she told Kira . - Vic . - Yeah . - Since you died he 's even more obsessed . He wants to meet Kira . - No . - No . I know that . Of course not . You think we 'd let that happen ? Hey , what 's that ? Right there , it looks like ... Looks like blood . Hey , whoa , what 's going on ? - Nothing . - Hey ! Nothing , I don 't want to talk about it . Sarah ? Ah , you remember those birth certificates ? - Yeah , Beth 's and the two others ? - Yeah , Katja and Alison . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Well , I met the German . - What ? Is she another twin ? Yeah . - Leave it out , Felix . Don 't . - Did she say who she was ... - What did she say ? - I 'm not getting into it ... I can 't ... - I seriously cannot explain it . - All right , fine . Stop . Look , I need you to tell Mrs. S , I 'm not dead . Yeah ? That it was all a mistake . No , no way , you do it . If I walk in there now , after 10 months , think about how hard she can make custody . What , so I go in and I say what ? Lie ? Oh , my God . Tell her it wasn 't me , I don 't care , just make sure Kira knows I 'm fine . Yeah ? We can still get out with her . That 's my one bit of good news ! - Is this evil twin 's money ? - Yeah , $ 75,000 in cash ! That 's enough to lose Vic , lose the twin sister weirdness , go somewhere safe with my daughter . Is that so much to ask ? Yeah . Maybe . - What ? - Detective Arthur Bell . What ? Bastard must have followed me and nicked it . All right . All right , let 's not go off though , okay ? Hey , no ... Let 's not ... Sarah ! - Sarah ... Sarah ! Fuck ! Fuck that ! Bastard ! Sarah ... Whoa , hey , no , not that ! I 'm working on that . Maggie Chen . Who the hell is Maggie Chen ? Uh , it 's the woman Beth shot . All right , so now what are these ? Right ? Official statement . Detective Arthur Bell , official statement . Detective Elizabeth Childs . What is this ? This is ... This is like the case . He left it for me ... Her . If I want the money back from Art , I have to be Beth again . Oh , for Christ 's sake , how long can you keep gaming a cop ? Till I get our money . It 's six in the morning . You 're going to call him now ? - Yeah , believe me , this call he 's waiting for . - Took you a while . - What the hell are you doing ? Me ? I 'm just following orders , Beth . - Orders to steal from me ? - Lieutenant said , " Take your rookie by the hand , walk her right through the hearing . " Did you stop to check it before you crossed the border ? Art , I 'm at home . You got it all wrong . I never get it all wrong , - do I ? - Well , it 's not what you think . Meet me at Fung 's at noon . Fung 's ? What the hell 's Fung 's ? Paul ? - Where were you last night ? - Oh , shit ! Don 't do that . I ... Um , I was at the station . I was , um , catching up on this back log . You 're under suspension . Yeah , so ? They reconvened the hearing . I have to get on top of this stuff . First you screw me wild for the first time in months and then you don 't even call me to tell me that you 're out all night ? And why are you suddenly dressing like a punk rock ho ? Say again . No , you know what , don 't . I 'm going to ignore that . I 'm worried you 're losing the plot again . We 've been here before . No , Paul , we definitely haven 't been here before . Sorry , I 've got ... I 've got a lot of work to do . If you want , I could take it to the station , yeah ? Beth , you 're not ready for this , you need to take more time . Is that a diagnosis ? ' Cause I have plenty of professional help for that . - Hey , please ? - Don 't touch me ! You know , I can see the shooting is killing you , - but you stopped talking to me months ago . - Paul ... - I mean , what am I supposed to do ? - It 's my problem . - You don 't have to take this on . - Well , I have . And I can 't keep waking up every night , checking your breathing , worried you 're mixing your meds , booze , God knows what else . So ... I 'm going back to Cody 's for a while . Okay . Yeah , if that 's what you want . Punk rock ho ? Oh ! Hi , monkey ! Did you see my mum ? Oh , um ... Sweetie ... - Oi oi , Mrs. S. - Go on upstairs , Kira love . Uncle Felix has got some explaining to do . MRS. S : I knew it was too good to be true . Sarah 's too tough to commit suicide . Most feral mutt I ever took in . Don 't shrug . Staging a funeral to get away from Vic . Why would you help such a stupid plan ? - Vic 's a dick . Plagued that girl was , from the very start . What do you mean by that ? Tell her she hasn 't seen her daughter in almost a year and ... I think it 's best if it stays like that . Why don 't you tell her yourself , Siobhan ? - I 'm not going to play Felix in the middle . - Oh , no ? You 're here at her beck and call , aren 't you ? Yes , I am . To make sure that Kira doesn 't think that her mother 's dead . And , oh good , look , she doesn 't . You and Sarah , you can work out the rest . Years of my life . Leaving London . All my people there , to bring the two of you here for a fresh start . I 'd do it all again , Felix . Every visit from the bloody police about her , every missing persons report . Every punch we threw . Because Kira - is a gift . - Sarah knows that . No . She hasn 't a clue . She is trying . Badly . Granted . But in her own way , she is , she 's really trying . Oh , ho ho ! Caught ya ! Come here , come here , monkey ! - When is Mummy coming ? You know when , love . - When she 's ready . - And ? When you say she 's ready . Sounds fair to me . Right here . Right where I thought I saw Yip . That 's when I drew my weapon . She ... What did she do ? It 's not a payoff , Art . It 's not . Then cut the shit , Beth , and tell me where it came from . It 's Paul 's , okay ? It 's Paul 's and mine . I cleaned out our joint savings account . I haven 't told him yet . Yeah , I was going to leave town . But I couldn 't do it , okay ? I turned around . - For Paul ? - To clear the shooting , Art . I 'm not dirty , I just freaked out . Are you wearing a wire ? - No . - You never saw the Vic , before . - No previous contact with Margaret Chen ? - No ! Art . If there is another version of this story , - if that money is somehow connected ... - There 's only one story , Art . Walk me through it again . So I know you won 't crack under questioning . I was by myself , I was canvassing witnesses on another case . - Which case ? - The Ramsey thing , the Sun Jewelry heist . The Ramsey thing , Sun Jewelry heist . - I wasn 't even looking for Yip ... - Yip , who ? Xan Yip , US racketeering warrant . I 'd seen her sheet that morning , Asian , female , 41 . And ? And ... Right here , where I thought I saw Yip ... - You thought ? - I did , I saw her . I called her name , I told her to freeze . She didn 't . She ran . Disappeared down . - You 're making me nervous . - Good . Now you know how it feels . When did you draw your weapon ? I drew when I entered the courtyard here . That 's when I drew my weapon and then she disappeared down there . I crossed her there and that 's when I heard somebody behind me . And I turned around and I fired twice . - They were both firing back . It wasn 't her . It wasn 't her . Then what ? Then I saw the phone in her hand and I called it in . And then you showed up . If they find out that you called me before you called it in , Beth ... They 're gonna start to dig . And if they dig , they find the pills . And if they find the pills , you may crack under questioning , and tell them that I put the phone in the vic 's hand to cover your tweaker ass . I wouldn 't do that , Art . No , I 've got to carry what I did . Maggie Chen was in the wrong place at the wrong time . That 's it . None of this ends up on you . Good . But to be sure , I 'm going to hang on to that money until you 're cleared . How 's that ? Kira 's fine , you 're not dead to your daughter . - Come here . She 's knows I 'm back , doesn 't she ? I can feel her . - She knows , she 's been asking for you . - Mmm-hmm . All right . Okay , what about Mrs. S ? Don 't worry about that now , okay ? We 'll work it out later . - Thank you . - Just take us with you when you leave again . I promise , I promise , I promise , I will . - Do you want a cuppa ? - Yeah . So , Art won 't give me the money until I clear Beth 's shooting . What do you mean ? Like , go back in front of the police board ? Like , lawyers and cross-examination and stuff ? Yeah . That 's the least of my worries . That 's Beth 's other phone . Is that the German ? It 's definitely not the German . All right , I think it 's time that you tell me what 's actually going on . - Beth was investigating the twins , too . I think whatever she found out drove her nuts and she topped herself . What ? - So do I pick up ? - No ! - No ! - I can 't help myself . - Then why even ask ? Hello , this is Beth . Finally ! Where have you been ? Busy , obviously . Right , did you get the German 's briefcase ? No . Why ? Because I told you to . Where is she staying , Beth ? - Hello ? - One sec . Okay . Uh , Carlsborough Hotel , room 303 . Well , go get the briefcase before they do . - I 'll call back at midnight . What 's in ... What 's in the briefcase ? Who is that ? Every time I think I learn something , I 'm wrong . Whoa , hold on . Beth , Katja and Alison Hendrix . Is that her ? I don 't know , Felix . But what happened to the German ? Are you seriously going there ? Don 't you wanna know what 's in the briefcase ? No ! Cash ? It 's still a hustle , Fe . - Can I borrow this ? - No . Yeah . I don 't know . Mmmm . Guten Morgen , Katja Obinger . - Sarah ... - Don 't worry . You actually look kind of hot . It 's good , isn 't it ? Miss Obinger . Miss Obinger ! - Is that her ? - Yeah . Shit ! Yeah ? Hello . Avery from the front desk . Could we talk with you downstairs , please ? Why would you go in my room ? We had a noise complaint which led to a security check . Ma 'am , your room is trashed . Rock and roll . Rock and roll ? The sink is broken . What the heck is wrong with you ? Unfortunately , we have an itemized bill . Sink , mirror , three pillows . $ 6,000 ? $ 6,437.1 1 , yes . Yeah . So , you have my card on file , yeah ? Yes . And my briefcase . One moment . Authorizing . Must have been a heck of a party . Everything appears to be in order . We 're very sorry about this . Are you enjoying the city ? It 's killing me . Danke schön . Danielle Fournier . Katja . Austrian . Italian . Danielle Fournier , France . Alison Hendrix . Scarborough . You 're practically local . - And punctual . - Hello . - Hey , did you get to the hotel ? Yeah , but , uh ... Somebody got there first . They ransacked her room . Shit . No briefcase ? I didn 't say that . Did you find it or not ? Hang on . Screw it . Hello . - Who am I speaking to ? - Beth ? - Alison ? - Who is this ? Who is this ? Beth 's indisposed . Is this Alison ? Just one . I 'm a few , no family , too . Who am I ? Yeah , sorry , riddler . It means nothing to me . Look , Beth said to say I have the briefcase . Do you want me to bring it to you ? 35 , Black Oak Drive . You stop it . You stop it . Hey , hey , hey ! Don 't hurt her . Holy shite ! A soccer mom ! Okay , follow your sister . Don 't run . Good boy . Good boy . - There you go . Hello . Go . Go , go . Vivian , I 'm gonna cut the ... - I just want some answers . Are you out of your mind ? How dare you show your face in front of my children ? How did you find me ? German had your address . I 've got what you wanted . I 've got her briefcase . Idiot . Do you even know who you 're talking to ? Hmm ? Where is Beth ? Uh , she 's dead . What ? I 'm sorry , she killed herself . No . No . No , she wouldn 't do that . That 's impossible . I 'm ... I 'm sorry , I saw her do it . No , that can 't be . I can explain , okay ? - My name 's Sarah ... - I don 't care who you are . Why , Lord ? Why me ? I never wanted any part of this . Do I wear a huge " kick me " sign on my back ? Please , just tell me who are we to each other ? Are you kidding me ? I 'm not doing that . Nope , that is not my responsibility . You need to get out of here . Go and wait for a call . - Hey , tell me what the ... - Let go . Don 't touch me ! This is my neighborhood . You wait for a call . Oh , and hide your ugly face on the way out of here . - Bitch ! Okay , oranges , guys . Come on . - I 'll take two . - Yeah , you take two . - What 's up , Art ? - Where are you ? I 'm at home in the tub with a bourbon . - Can you hear me knocking ? No ? Because you 're not home . Okay , I 'm in Scarborough . What ? Why ? I had to go to Bed , Bath Beyond , okay , nobody wants to admit that . Look , whatever , Beth . What the hell did you say to the shrink ? She 's ruling you unfit for duty . What ? Why ? Yeah . Unfit means no hearing tomorrow . Oh , shit ! It means this crap goes on and on . And guess what ? I 'm keeping your money until it ends . - I 'll go see her now . - No , no , no . It 's too late for that , Beth . Get me another appointment , okay ? Tell her it 's an emergency , you 're worried about me . She 's my doctor , she has to see me . And what are you gonna say to her to change her mind ? I 'll figure something out . I 'm sorry . My opinion is you 're not ready for duty . I am though . I 'm making progress , full progress . Go on . You know , with the guilt , um ... Seeing cell phone and reacting gun . You 're just parroting our last meeting back to me . No , I 'm admitting my mistake . Dr. Bowers , I 'm acknowledging it , like you said . Honestly , the best thing for me now is to get back to work . Last time I saw you , you couldn 't remember the shooting . " I 'm missing myself . I glitched . A break or something . " I remember it just fine . What I 'm trying to do is move on . Sorry , Beth , but considering your mental state leading up to the incident ... - That 's behind me now ... - And by your own admission of blackout or psychotic break , I can 't recommend you for duty . That 's not gonna work for me . I understand , you 're a cop . But this is my job . Can you read that back again ? That , uh , I 'm missing myself , I glitched . Does that sound stoned to you ? Glitch sound stoned ? Uh , tweaked , gakked , spun ? Alevia , superprax , draxophyl . What is the difference between a mood stabilizer and an antipsychotic , again ? - Beth ! - No , sorry , I 've been confused . I mean , it 's very confusing . Um ... Antidepressants , antianxieties , SSRIs . Serotronax . That one 's a stimulant . We have known each other for a while now , Beth . Yeah , that 's where you 're wrong . You have constantly tested me with your personal appeals for prescriptions . I know . My bad . So , I 'll just explain to the board that I shot this poor civilian after mixing up all your overlapping scrips . Or am I making progress ? All right , if everybody 's here , let 's see if we could do this again . Board convenes in a fatal line-of-duty shooting , October seventh of this year . State your name and rank for the record . And begin . Detective Elizabeth Childs . You did well . We 'll have a ruling in a couple of days . Okay . - This is Sarah . - Well , Sarah , this will be quick . Good . Since you apparently already know where I live , and I can 't find a sitter , come by after 9 : 00 tonight . - How about right now ? - Tonight ! Bring whatever you got from the German . Go around back and go to the basement door . - Knock quietly . Not bad , Childs . Not bad . I nailed it , man . Every detail . Yeah , they haven 't ruled yet . Please contain your excitement . This is me excited . Come on , Art , give me a little love here . Yeah ? Why do you have to be such a hard-ass ? 'Cause it 's your favorite thing about me . Look , uh , Paul doesn 't know that I took that money out of our account . So just let me put it back before he finds out , yeah ? I hang on to it till you 're reinstated . That 's the deal . There was no deal . It was just you ... Looking out for you . Partner . Oh , my God ! Ugh ! You know I never would have got in if you said we were going to suburbia . Oi , what you doing ? Don 't stop , someone might speak to us . God ! Christ ! You know , my skin just breaks out every time I leave downtown . Yeah . Yeah , right there . Look . Acne . I don 't see acne . Am I blushing ? There 's redness , it 's right there . Tiny little suburban stress zits emerging in direct proximity to bad architecture . Look , Fe , I 'm gonna have the money in a couple days . Okay ? And then , look , I 'll make good with Mrs. S , and we 'll take Kira somewhere quiet , yeah ? Somewhere warm . Yeah . Please . So , what 's in the house ? - Won 't be long . - What ? Oh , my God . Who 's in there ? - Stay here , okay ? - Is it the German ? The German 's dead . She 's dead ! She died ! Sadly , yes . This one 's an uptight soccer mom . Whoa , hey , Sarah , you always do this to me . I just need you to be my backup , okay ? I don 't do backup . I don 't even know what backup is . - Give me half an hour . - What am I supposed to do till then ? Nothing . Just need somebody to know where I am . That is not comforting . Sarah ! Shit . Close it . Lock it . - Really ? Be quiet , my kids are sleeping . You 're gonna shoot me while your kids are sleeping . You wake them or show your face , yes , I will shoot you . Well , I 've never known a blood relation , but being your twin certainly sucks ! You really have no idea , do you ? Hey . I 'm Cosima . Bloody hell ! We talked on the phone . How many of us are there ? We 're clones . We 're someone 's experiment and they 're killing us off . Is that helpful ? - Oh , my God ! - What are you doing in my yard ? You want answers , I want the briefcase . Seriously , it 's life or death . What kind of a mother am I if I snatch my own daughter ? You 're reinstated . Holy shit . Yes , I 'm at the bloody crime scene pretending to be a bloody cop . So I need to know if the bloody fingerprints will flag a bloody match . Freeze ! Police ! Beth !

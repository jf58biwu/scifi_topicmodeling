 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You are guardian now . Collodi 's Bracelet . I think it fell into the hands of a young boy . His name 's Walter Sykes . The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . That young boy is now the man who is attacking us . I know who 's working for him . A guy by the name of Marcus . He just walked away from a five-story fall . Why can 't I move . Because I 'm controlling your body now . There are things that you don 't know . About the Regents , about Jane . I am undercover . No ! Hey . I , uh , I told Artie . So the Regents are going to send someone to get- - for Steve . Pete ? [ Sighs ] How could this happen ? It 's- - Claudia ? Listen to me . We need you to hack into that laptop , okay ? There could be something there that- - Claude , listen to me . We need to find Sykes , right ? We need to find him and we need to stop him . Claudia ? Myka . Yeah ? Steve is dead . How can you just be business as usual ? Because if I don 't , I will lose it . So you need to help me . I 'll stay with him . [ Typing on keyboard ] They ran a fat man on the memory . What 's a fat man ? Fat man and little boy . It 's a deletion program . It 's a hacker nuclear bomb . This hard drive is a crater . This was for nothing . Sykes needed H.G. for something . We need to find him . [ Whispers ] Oh , we 're gonna find him . And when we find him ... We 're gonna get payback . [ Chuckles ] You 're not too talkative , Ms. Wells . Penny for your thoughts ? You killed that young man in cold blood . Really ? What temperature was your blood when you killed ? 'Cause you got a bigger body count than I do . And I 'm seriously considering adding one more to that list . Go ahead . [ Scoffs ] Go ahead . Go ahead . Go on . [ Groans ] Kill me . Cecil B. Demille 's riding crop . Look at that . Lets my mind control your body . It 's pretty damn cool , don 't you think ? [ Groans ] What do you want from me ? Some advice . I 'd strongly recommend a good psychologist . [ Chuckles ] Advice on what ? Opening a certain lock . According to this , you got an old friend who taught you how to do it , right ? Something named Caturanga . Ms. Wells ? What do you smell ? Ms. Wells ? What do you smell ? Apples ? Yes . You do . Most people do not smell the apples . The Warehouse likes you . Buildings do not have personal affinities , sir . This is not , as you will discover , just a building , Miss Wells . Welcome to Warehouse 12 . I am Caturanga . And you 're in charge here ? [ Laughs ] Oh , no ! My job is to teach and to solve puzzles , we shall say . What kind of puzzles ? Many sorts , and to design them , too . Sometimes to house a dangerous artifact , like that one . Uh-uh-ah . Sometimes , to brew the perfect cup of tea . This is England , so a good cup of tea is not hard to find . Yes , but ... The perfect cup of tea- - that 's a puzzle . [ Laughs ] I 've read some of your stories . You are very gifted . I thought my imagination knew no boundary , but to stand here , amidst this wonderment- - [ laughs ] There 's always more to learn . I will teach you . [ Laughs ] I 'll die before I help you . Oh , you 'll help me . Whether you live or die is entirely up to you . ♪ Warehouse 13 3x12 ♪ Stand Original Air Date on October 3 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = It doesn 't get easier , does it ? To lose a fellow Agent . I 've lost fellow agents ... partners , friends , Steve ... he was my responsibility . You might have told me that he was undercover . Are you angry ? Does it matter ? There 's always a cost . What is Sykes planning ? And how are we going to stop him ? The Regents are assembling to regroup . I 'll keep you posted . The Warehouse has always endured , Arthur . Remember this watch ? Used to argue over it . I think you should have it . Good luck , old friend . I imagine you 're going to need it . [ Door slams shut ] You guys all right ? We are ... On the other side of the world from all right . How did they do it ? An injection . They made it look like a heart attack . Found this stuff on him . I didn 't even know the guy smoked . He didn 't . His father was a chain smoker . Steve hated smoking . That 's my boy . What is that ? Steve doing his job . Hey , guys . Bad news is if you 're watching this , I 'm probably screwed . So , I 'll keep it short . Still nothing on Sykes ' end game . He plays it pretty close to the vest . But I can tell you that he 's made travel arrangements to Hong Kong . I don 't know why . But it 's definitely not a pleasure trip . There 's one other thing . Sykes ' number two- - Marcus Diamond- - the guy who doesn 't die , something 's strange about him . He gets this look when Sykes brings out this wooden box . It 's probably an artifact . Artie , you should check it out . Agent Steve Jinks signing off . Good luck , you guys . Claude . Keep the faith . Good work , Jinxy . Indeed . Agent Jinks may have given us the final piece to the puzzle . Why ? What 's in Hong Kong ? Something we thought was gone and buried forever . Walter Sykes may have uncovered the ancient Regent Sanctum . If the Regent Sanctum was constructed during the era of Warehouse 7 , it predates H.G. by centuries . What does Sykes want with her ? No idea . All knowledge of the sanctum was purged from warehouse records when it was finally shut down for good . That was over 100 years ago . And ... if it was just a meeting place , why would he even care about it ? I got it . Three tickets to Hong Kong . Purchased from Tyler 's IP address . Three ? Sykes , Tyler , Marcus , H.G. ? Somebody did not make that trip . They 're gonna get there before us . And he has an advantage . He knows where it is , and we don 't . I found this in the Escher Vault . It was worn by the Regents of Warehouse 7 . Claudia ? See if you can get us the history on this thing . Wait . That 's the Chinese symbol for ... Aperture . Aperture could be a facility that manufactures cameras ? Or a location that acts as an aperture . Somewhere , light hits a certain way . Oh , how very Indiana Jones . The roads . The--the--the roads in- - [ whispering ] Roads , I remember- - there 's something- - See , the roads kind of- - see that ? They connect ... In almost forms a- - Might see the- - You two know you haven 't actually finished a sentence yet , right ? Well , the same symbol that--that means aperture can also mean eye . As in ... The eye of Horus . Now , look , this is Hong Kong circa ... 1600 . These roads--the roads today , are all based on these roads . And--take a look at this . Look . The roads form an Eye of Horus . Iris of the eye . It 's a city . Tai Po . Good a place to start as any . We 'll , uh , we 'll check in when we get there . Claudia ... I think it 'd be a good idea- - Excuse me . Claudia ? You have every right to be angry . Agents Jinks was a good man . And what happened was a tragedy . And ? And what ? And I 'm really sorry I sent him to his death ? Steve died alone . Cut off from everybody who had his back . And for what ? Why ? Agent Jinks did not want to put any of you at risk . He volunteered for- - To take down Walter Sykes for the good of the world . But let 's face it , Jane . This was never about the good of the world , was it ? This was about your guilt . You made Walter Sykes . No , Claudia . I tried to prevent Walter Sykes from being made . If we had gotten to the artifact in time- - But you didn 't and he became a psychopathic killer . And now all you care about is fixing your mistake , no matter who gets hurt or killed along the way . That 's not true ! It 's just not- - [ sighs ] You 're upset . This is not the time to discuss whether Agent Jinks was- - Steve ! His name was Steve . You know , I see you and the Regents for what you really are . Cowards . Steve was worth a thousand of you . This is exactly where the eye would be , but maybe it 's just a restaurant . Then why did I get a vibe that almost knocked me over ? I 'm here in a Chinese restaurant , Myks . And I 'm not hungry . I know there 's something here . We--we are at the dead center of the city , and- - What ? What is it ? If the sanctum was built that long ago ... What if the restaurant isn 't the sanctum ? What if it 's on top ... of the sanctum ? [ Sighs ] Well , I would say that we 're in the right place . What do you got ? Well , I doubt H.G. and a stock boy wear the same locket . [ Faint thud ] Somebody there ? [ Gasps ] Nothing . I don 't know . Maybe they realized it was the wrong place and left . [ Sighs ] But ... why do I still have a vibe ? Because H.G. left that locket as a clue . I know it . Pete ? Yeah ? Look at this . It looks like something swept across the floor . What is it ? A--like a- - a door , or ... Opening ? Maybe we can- - the Eye of Horus . I believe the phrase is aha . Please , Mr. Sykes , don 't make me do this . Tyler , make the move the lady suggested . Now . This is lunacy . It 's not a move . It 's a guess . I don 't care . We don 't know if we don 't play . Now move that piece . The first two were wrong . The third could- - Enough ! Tyler , what are you waiting for ? Look at those skulls . They 're all cracked in half . Yeah , I think I see why . Please , Mr. Sykes . Don 't make him do it . Tyler , you got to be in it to win it . Now . Good lad . Checkmate . No ! [ Gasps ] First show 's over . Lattimer and Bering ? Come on down ! [ Gunshot ] Myka , are you all right ? I didn 't do that . No , I 'm--I 'm fine . Myka , that 's only because I control where she shot . Next time , her aim is going to be a lot better . Okay ? Let 's go , guys . Guns on the floor , please ? Or the next shot is going to be right between Ms. Bering 's beautiful eyes . You son of a- - [ gunshot ] Stop it ! I don 't understand . Why is there a torture device in the Regent Sanctum ? It 's not a torture device , honey . It 's a lock . It was invented by a man named Caturanga . He was rather the Claudia of Warehouse 12 and my teacher . That 's why you needed Helena to open it . She 's the only living person who knew this ... Caturanga . See , the pieces are set so the player 's in check . You win the game , and the lock opens . You lose the game , and your skull opens . When the Regents shut down the Sanctum a century ago , Caturanga designed the lock . Now , the secret to opening it is not in the journals . But he writes a lot about Ms. Wells , here . She 's his favorite student . I think she knows about it . Caturanga taught me a thousand things , but I have never seen the chess lock before . I don 't know how to open it . I know , and you clearly demonstrated with young Tyler , here . You did that . I tried to stop you ! I swear it . You know what ? Maybe I used the wrong incentive . No ! [ Screams ] Myka ! Myka ! [ Grunting ] Now that there 's somebody in the chair you care about , maybe your memory will come back . What is that ? A gift from a former employer . What do you want from me ? I 'm just an innkeeper . Oh , we both know you 're more than that , don 't we ? If you think that I 'm gonna help you break into the warehouse , you 're in for a surprise . No . No , you see , it 's you people who are gonna be surprised . [ Beeping ] [ Alarm blaring ] What is that ? Something 's wrong at Leena 's . Pull up the security feed . Way ahead of you . [ Screams ] It 's him . Leena . Ah ! All right , all right . If we unlock this thing , what are we going to find ? You 'll see . Have you considered that we might be unlocking an artifact deemed too dangerous to be kept in Warehouse 7 ? She 's right , you know . The Regents must have had a reason to keep people out . Don 't tell me about the Regents or the reasons , okay ? You have one choice . Open the lock , or she 's gonna die . Now , how do we beat it ? This was Caturanga 's passion . We played every day for years . You beat him all the time ? Not once . [ Sighs ] Oh , great . All right . Time to make a move . With Tyler , I--I chose the King 's gambit . Caturanga would have expected that . Perhaps- - yes , perhaps the--the Dragon 's variant . Myka , King 's Knight ... to E-6 . Check . You 're distracting the player , Pete . Queen 's Bishop ... to h-4 . Check . [ Gasps ] I don 't know what else to do ! Helena . Continuing . Sorry , Myka . Helena , listen to me . I am not going to die here today , okay ? Because you are going to take a breath , and you 're gonna save my life . This isn 't what I signed up for . These Regents of yours are gravely mistaken if they think I shall be carrying around this . The Webley Mark One .450 caliber , standard issue of the Royal Navy and police constabularies . A fine weapon . Guns have no place in a civilized society , sir . Now , the Regents set the rules , and their rules states all warehouse agents must carry a firearm . But there is always an alternative to killing . I agree . That is not standard issue . I changed the rules . Wells , time for target practice . [ Gun zapping ] Is he dead ? No , no . Agent McShane is merely stunned . When the rules do not agree with one , it is sometimes necessary to change them . Change the rules . What ? Change the rules . Myka , D-3 ... to E-8 . Helena , I-I- - I can 't move my pawn like that . I know . Change the rules . Checkmate . Whatever it is , I think it 's about to open . [ Sighs ] Do it . Artie , what 's that ? Black Barty 's Cannon . Black Barty ? Black Barty was one of the most successful pirate captains of the golden age . And his cannon from his ship was rumored to have artifact-augmented firepower . Are you telling me that Walter Sykes ' plan is to fire a cannonball at the Warehouse ? A cannonball wouldn 't worry me , but a cannonball from that cannon ? I 'm approaching worry . I 'm not . What the hell 's happening ? [ Thunder clapping ] [ Groans ] What just happened ? The Remati Shackle sensed an attack and activated a protective barrier around the Warehouse . We 're safe . I gotta get to Leena 's . Once the shackle is activated , I 'm afraid no one can get in or out . Claudia ! I want you to- - Artie , I have a bad feeling . I have a bad vibe . But you said that nothing could get in once the barrier was up . True , but it can 't stop something that 's already inside . The Regents wanted to know our vulnerability . I think we just found it . Amazing . The warehouse . [ Grunts ] You guys ! Run ! [ Gun zapping ] Bastard . No ! No . They must have shut it down from the other side . I hope you don 't mind . I let myself in . Initiating the barrier automatically triggered the emergency exit portal- - To the ancient sanctum . When the Regents abandoned the portal , they locked it up , but it wasn 't enough just to trigger on one side . You had to unlock the Hong Kong side as well . Which is why you needed H.G. You 'd have been proud of her . She only killed one guy doing it . Peter , are you hurt ? No . A little tired of this guy , though . You 'll never get what you want . Difference of opinion , Jane . See , I think I 'm gonna get exactly what I want . Artie , no ! [ Grunting ] Oh ! Artie ! That 'll be your only warning . Play nice . Artie , I 'm sorry . It 's his crop . It 's got wicked mojo . Are you okay ? I 've been better . Why don 't you just kill us ? I 'm going to . But we 're going to go find the Collodi Bracelet , first . And this time , Jane , you 're going to watch your son hand it to me . There 's gotta be another way to open this . I just- - I have to think . Myka , I 'm sorry . About what ? You should have destroyed the Janus coin the moment you found it . Then I wouldn 't have caused all of this . I wish that you would stop doing that . Doing what ? You 're not the bad guy , okay ? I believed in you , and I was right . So get off your--your cross , and help me figure this out . Righty-ho , then . Old times , Wells and Bering , solving puzzles , saving the day . Bering and Wells . There are consequences to using the Collodi Bracelet . There were consequences to not using it . It 's a part of me . I close my eyes , and I can see it . Without it , there 's a hole in my soul . That 's what it does to you . It 's not real . It 's not a real need . It is real to me ! [ Groans ] Oh , no . Or did you not know that , Jane ? Wearing the bracelet creates a insatiable longing- - It hardens your heart . It darkens your soul . And if we let you keep the bracelet , you never would have been able to love , or be loved . If you did everything right , then why are we here ? We didn 't get to you soon enough . The seeds of darkness had already taken root . You 've killed a lot of people , Walter . But I take responsibility for that . Oh , that 's big of you , Jane . It 's not too late . We could still try to save you . Mom , please . I don 't think you 're going to hurt me . I think you understand what I 'm saying . I think you know there 's been enough damage done . I think you 're ready to stop this . But , Jane , then you 'd have solace . I want you to feel the guilt and the pain . Like I have . You should have opted for the opportunity I just gave you . I will take the risk . And the bracelet . Pete ? [ Communicator beeps ] Marcus . I have it . Go ahead . You 'll never win . Pete and Myka and the others- - they 'll fight back . Possibly . [ Gasps ] But you would have had a heart attack by then . Put that syringe down , Mr. Diamond . I 'm impressed . Imagine my delight . Drop it , please . It 's about time . I didn 't think you 'd let me kill her . And I knew you 'd wait for me . You never should have come . I made you a promise a long time ago . I honor my commitments . This is Marcus Diamond , former Baltimore City Detective . Shot in the line of duty . Three times . Dead center . And you lived ? Bullets are still in his heart . If you know that much about me , you know that metal won 't kill me . Yes . But it will cause you unending pain . You have no idea what 's about to happen . Oh , but I do . Finally . Right where it belongs . You got what you wanted . Get out . No , this is just step one . Before you die , I want you to know what it feels like when something you love is ripped away from you . [ Grunts ] No , please . I 'm responsible . Kill me . [ Gun zapping ] Myka , thank God ! Come on ! [ Coughs ] You guys , circle around . Don 't let him in the portal . Myka ! H.G. ! Rigging rope from the Mary Celeste . Hang on . No , Myka , don 't- [ screams ] Touch the rope ? I imagine it 's the rest of that sentence . [ Groaning ] If you pull at it , it only gets tighter . Oh , that 's good to know . Will you ever learn not to play with these things ? [ Coughs ] Let 's go . [ Gasps ] [ Laughs ] Hey ... You 're too young to have seen the Frazier Ali fight , right ? What ? They never saw his right uppercut coming . You know I think we 're beyond needing to make your death look like an accident . No ! [ Groaning ] Claudia , what is that ? No . This is Johann Maelzel 's metronome . Sykes uses it to keep Marcus alive . That was for Steve . Thank God , Myka left it open . Get away from her ! Walk into this ! Walter ! Walter , take my hand . [ Alarm blaring ] Mom . Are you- - are you okay ? Yes . You ? Yeah . Walter Sykes has left the building . The portal 's kaput . And you 're gonna need to fly back . All right , so , get home safe , okay ? And , um , Mom . I love you . I love you , too , honey . Pete ! What happened ? Where are they ? What took you guys so long ? Just lazy , I guess . Sykes ? - Dead . - Is Jane all right ? Well , she 's got a 15-hour plane ride ahead of her , but , yeah , she 's okay . [ Sighs ] Thank you . Anytime . [ Farnsworth buzzing ] Claude , hey . Are you okay ? Yes , and so are Leena and Mrs. Frederic . Marcus is dead . It 's over . Why is that light still- - What--what is it ? They 're all- - Artie ? Artie , what 's wrong ? Wait . Mrs. Frederic . How long should the barrier normally stay active ? Once the danger to the Warehouse passes , it dissipates instantly . Well , then , why is it still up ? The Warehouse isn 't in danger anymore . Is it ? Was he just gonna collect the Collodi artifact and walk out of here ? He said he was gonna kill us all , but he never tried to . A man who can walk does not need- - He planned on leaving it behind . Yeah , but why ? Uh-oh . I know that writing . That 's from the House of Commons in London . Oh , no . How bad ? The House of Commons was partially destroyed during the Blitzkrieg of World War II . And there was a piece of masonry . It was said to absorb the concussive force of the entire German Luftwaffe . This is an artifact nuclear device ... and it 's counting down . [ Beeping ] The Ovoid quarantine can offer some protection to the rest of the Warehouse , but I-I doubt it . I don 't understand . I mean , who builds a force field that locks you in ? Well , the barrier was initiated first ... as a way ... of dealing with external danger . The barrier 's still active . All right , the primary function of the Warehouse is to protect the world 's artifacts , but the barrier , now , its mandate has shifted- - To containing the blast and protecting the world from an artifact fallout and- - If there is a big , ugly explosion , and unfortunately , if there are agents inside , that 's just collateral damage . There 's less than two minutes left on the detonator . All right . Let me at that thing . I 'm not finding anything yet . Keep looking . Something 's gotta neutralize that bomb . Something . Can 't find anything on the databases , either . Okay , so why can 't we just go to the Warehouse , and find a way to break them out ? Even if we cannot stop the explosion- - We can 't get through the barrier . Besides , there isn 't time . Can I maybe hack my way in and deactivate the barrier that way ? The power isn 't derived from the main system . It 's derived from the Remati Shackle . Claudia . You 're going to have to give me back that metronome , please . Now , please . No . You know we can 't use artifacts . What I know is I 'm tired of arbitrary rules . The metronome is for Steve . I 'm bringing him back . Nope . Takes a licking and keeps on trying to kill us . Okay , the portal 's closed . There 's--there 's no back door . No , no back door outside the barrier , anyway . Come on , Myka . We 've gotten out of worse than this . No , we have--we have . There 's a solution , and we can find it . All we have to do is keep a cool head . We 'll find it in ... 56 seconds . He did say that we 'd go out together . I always figured we would . Not me . I was planning on outliving both of you lunatics . [ Laughs ] And here we go . Hey . Helena ? What are you doing ? [ Laughs ] She 's trapped us . Helena , what is this ? Sorry . It was the only way I could think to save you . What have you done ? There was no other way . An anomaly in the system allowed me to re-route a portion of the outer barrier to that spot on the floor . I just hope it lasts . You 've protected us from the blast . You should be safe now . But you 're- - you 're out there . It had to be initiated from outside the barrier . No , listen . You gotta let us help you . It doesn 't have to be this way . [ Overlapping pleas ] [ Silently ] Yes . [ Inhales ] I smell apples . [ Timer beeping ] Claudia , the Warehouse- - Mrs. Frederic ! That was his plan . To destroy the entire Warehouse . We lost , Artie . We lost . Not yet . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

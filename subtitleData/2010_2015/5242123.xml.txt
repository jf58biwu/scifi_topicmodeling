 Previously on Alphas . I have this thing where I can 't remember anything that happened , like , more than a month ago . I want to see if Nina can help you retrieve some memory that your brain has , for whatever reason , buried away . Is there anyone there with you ? There 's a woman . I think she 's my mother . I can no longer send an untrained and undisciplined civilian into the field . Quantico . It 's the FBI academy . Oh , thank you ! Bill , Parish somehow managed to coerce Senator Burton to fast-track this photostim to the FDA . Every August Medical photostim has been recalled and destroyed . Good . Make sure every import ban is retroactive . Of course . We 're finished . Charlotte , go home . I 've pushed the Senator too far . Her doctor needs these brain scans . Look , Nina , it 's risky . The Senator has a lot of resources . She could find you . What 's your relationship with Parish ? Oh ! Do you know Parish 's location ? Cover him ! Can you think back to the last time you saw Parish ? Hey ! Come on ! Hey ... Get over ! Relax , and tell me what I need to know . Look at me . Tell me the truth . Do you know Parish 's location ? Who else is involved ? What 's Parish planning ? When was the last time you saw him ? Fresh leads , take a look . Any insight from you will help us , uh , prioritize . Nathan , don 't you think this approach is a scattershot , really ? We 're hitting Parish 's organization from every angle . We 've got analysts working 24I7 . We 've got all the resources we could want . This place is like the freaking Bin Laden desk now . Yeah , and that took 10 years . But we got him . Anything jump out ? Uh , no . No , uh ... Not at the moment . Sorry . There 's more where that came from . Cameron , there 's a farmhouse at this address . If there 's anything there that can lead us to Parish , we need to get to it before the investigation . So you don 't trust Cley 's people . No , I don 't . We both know how Parish can twist people 's loyalties . Okay . It 's only a few hours away . Now , as much as I 'd like to go with you , I 'm afraid my sudden departure from here would garner more attention than I 'd like . But you will , however , need some backup . Someone who won 't be missed . Yes ! My first recon mission . Yay ! High five . Yes ! There 's a little more involved than just than reconnaissance , Kat . Okay , all ears . Quantico trained ears . Mr. Hicks is grieving . So I 'm counting on you to keep him focused on the task at hand . Yeah , of course . Dr. Rosen . That factory in China , the one that made the photic stimulators ... Yeah ? ... for Stanton Parish ? They just ... I just got a ping . They exported something to New York . But I don 't know what it was . But Senator Burton shut down August Medical . Oh , yeah , no , but it 's not August Medical anymore . Gary , will you try and discover what 's been exported ? Yeah , no . I was gonna do that anyway . Even if you didn 't ask me . That 's my hot lead . - Oh , Bill ? - Yeah ? Can you give me a ride to the hospital after work ? Gary , why do you need to go to the hospital ? Oh , ' cause my mom was in a car accident . Okay , first post-Quantico mission and I 'm totally psyched . Again with the video diary . I 'm all geared up . I have guns , tech gear , snacks , and I memorized the topography within a 50-mile radius . Guy 's leaving . By himself , leaving the premises . Matches profile described by locals . Total bad-ass , loner , ex-military type . I 'm forced to make an evaluation by eye because Hicks is bogarting the binoculars that I brought . All right , let 's see what 's so special about this place . Remember to check your danger areas upon entry . Show me your hands ! Right now . Did I ... Did I ever tell you about the time I met John McEnroe ? In Malibu , on the beach . He 's a lot nicer than you 'd think . We still keep in touch . What ? I liberated Buchenwald . But not all by myself . If you guys are hungry , I can whip up a little something . I studied at the Cordon Bleu . Hey , what 's your name ? Your name . Uh , uh , Mitchell . Okay , Mitchell . Why are you locked in this room ? I have to be here . I 'm very important . Yeah ? Says who ? Stanton Parish . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand . People don 't understand . People like me . No . So far , nothing . The scale in the bathroom is broken and there 's a butt-load of empty milk cartons in the trash . But besides that , the only thing out of the ordinary is this guy . The first time I saw The Boss was spring of ' 72 at the Stone Pony . - " The Boss ? " What do you mean , Parish ? - Springsteen . The guy still puts on a hell of a show . Pretty sure this dude 's cheese has slid off his cracker . Did I tell you that I burst in on Mitchell with a gun in my hand and a cute blond at my side ? That wasn 't you , that was me . What do you mean , " At my side ? " Since when did I turn into Tonto ? If Parish is keeping him locked in that farmhouse he must be important . Hey , Hicks , that massive jailer dude could be back at any time . Yeah , Doc , we gotta move . Bring him in quickly and quietly . All right . Let 's go . I don 't have my keys . Have you seen my keys ? Doctor Rosen ? Senator Charlotte Burton . I 'll be acting as the Senate liaison to the Parish Task Force . Yes , of course . Please , uh , come in . Thank you . A lead ? Uh , one of hundreds . We 're literally drowning in leads . Senator ? Yes , my question to you . Where is Parish vulnerable ? What are his weaknesses ? Well , if he has any , he 's , uh , he 's playing them very close to his vest . Don 't we all ? But everyone has an Achilles ' Heel , Dr. Rosen . Now , I 'd like to be brought up to speed . Uh , yes . Yes , of course . Let me show you to the conference room . Uh , Dr. Rosen , I know what you did . I asked around about your research . And I don 't think those medical files could 've come from anywhere else . If those brain scans hadn 't found their way to my neurologist , I 'm not sure I 'd be here today . I owe you my life . Nina , you went behind my back and provided her with a paper trail , which she has followed directly to me . I saved her . Lee , I know you . You don 't want her blood on our hands . It 's not her blood I 'm concerned about . If ... When she puts the pieces together , you and I could go to jail . Send her home . Push her ? I don 't know what that would do to her . We have other concerns right now . So what ? She 's an acceptable casualty ? All right . Then you leave . I 'm in the middle of interrogations right now . We don 't know if her seeing you is gonna trigger her memory . And that 's a risk I 'm not willing to take . Now , as soon as I can figure out a way to move her off the investigation I will let you know . Bill . I don 't like it here . I ... The last time I was in a hospital , I lost Anna again . I ... I don 't want to stay here . I understand , Gary , but no one likes hospitals . Okay ? Yeah , I know ... Including your mother . No , look , she 's still in surgery , okay ? Yeah , so ... Yeah , she 's unconscious , then . She doesn 't even know that I 'm here . Yeah . Come on , let 's go back to the office . Yup , not okay . Look , Bill , I have a hot lead . All right , well , then work from here . I can 't ... No , Bill . I can 't work from here . I don 't like it . We 've been over this already . Please chill , okay ? No . I don 't want to chill out . Gary , just chill and have a seat , please . I don 't want to chill out , Bill . Look , I 'm sorry , all right ? I just ... I 've been up half the night with Jeannie driving Adam around . Oh , he 's a baby . He doesn 't have anywhere to go . I know . I could ... Oh , no . That 's it . Bill , I found it . The shipment that arrived in New York from Stanton Parish 's factory . This is it . The manifest . It says , " Industrial Electronics . " I 'm gonna need more details , okay ? Yeah ... Anything on the factory ? Yeah , yeah . It 's all here , Bill , but I can 't read it . Neither can you . It 's all in Chinese . I was calm as we approached the farmhouse . Sliding into danger as if it were a pair of fuzzy slippers . Hicks , however , was a wreck . Reeked of fear and the breakfast burrito he ate a couple hours ago . I was calm as we approached the farmhouse . Come on , Hicks , why don 't we talk anymore ? We used to talk . Did we have some torrid sexual affair I 'm not remembering , or what 's the deal ? You want to talk about sex . I was stationed in the Philippines in the Second World War ... If the two of you don 't shut the hell up , I swear to God I will crash this car and I will kill us all . You got it ? Look , I 'm sorry about Dani . If you want to talk about it ... I don 't . Dani is dead . I 'm responsible for her death . I , I killed Dani . What the hell did you say ? Hicks ! Do something ! - He 's dead . - So is the car . Come on . We got to get off the road . If that guy called for backup , we 're in trouble . We gotta call Rosen . We 're out of cell range . We 're too far off the grid . I don 't have my keys ? I ... I can 't find my keys . You don 't have any keys . People locked in rooms aren 't usually given keys . Am I going home soon ? No , you 're not going home soon . Look , we need to keep moving . There could be a battalion of bad-asses coming after us ... No . You are gonna tell me how you are responsible for Dani 's death . And then ... I put my gun on Mitchell and ... And the prisoner looked really scared . Hicks , you can 't shoot the prisoner . They didn 't exactly teach us that at the academy but it was totally implied . Well , I didn 't go to the academy . So you tell me about Dani . About Dani ? I , uh , wanted to be straight with you . I want to be with him . I appreciate your candor . You deserve to be happy . As does Mr. Hicks . Don 't you ever do that to me again ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What just happened ? He just put me with Dani . I 'm not following , Hicks . It was like I was in a memory , all right ? But it wasn 't mine . Okay . Then whose memory was it ? I 've got a pretty good idea . Gary 's list from the factory , translated . All the industrial electronics have basically the same components as the photostim . The one used on Jason and me . So , Parish is still looking for a way to amplify Alpha abilities . Apparently so . Rachel , it 's critical we intercept the shipment before it gets to Parish . I was gonna walk back to the office . But , Google Maps said that it 'd take three hours , 18 minutes . I 'm not built for that . No , you 're not . I imagine this is pretty hard for you , huh ? Yeah . Do you know what this is like ? Remember ... Remember when you had Adam ? And he was just a helpless little baby ? Yeah , yeah , of course . It wasn 't even that long ago . I 've got a good memory , though , I 'm not Kat . Right . Well , that 's exactly how your mother feels , okay ? So , it 's your turn to look after her . It 's only right , partner . Right ? Right ? Yeah , Harken . Okay . I 'll be right there . Gary , I gotta go back to the office . That was Rosen . I 'll be back as soon as I can . You okay ? Gary , are you okay ? You okay ? How does he do that , huh ? Put me in someone else 's memory . Well , I 'm guessing he 's an Alpha . Oh , really ? You think ? Hey , can you mess with the cortisol level in people 's hippocampus ? Because that would totally affect people 's memory and reconsolidation . I 'm lactose intolerant . I mean , one slice of cheese and look out . Yeah . I don 't think he 'd understand what you were saying even if you did say it in English . Would you like me to ... Yeah , I 'd love to hear it in English . Thank you . So , he touches you , right , and zap , he records whatever memory you 're thinking about . He touches you later and he puts you back in , only in " HD smell-and - touch-o-vision . " Isn 't that right , Mitch ? All right . So you 're a Total Recall Alpha . I don 't ... It 's a movie . Okay , I 'll put it at the top of my queue . Look , I 'm guessing he can put you back in any memory he 's got stored in his head . Doesn 't even have to be your own . Pretty cool toy to keep around . So , if he 's holding Parish 's memories , he must be a mountain of intel . I 'm good for it . We 're still out of cell range . I memorized the cell coverage in this area . You 're not gonna get squat until we get back into town . Okay , well , which is the quickest way to town ? Is it this way ? No , the quickest way is to flag a car down and flash our badges , but ... Under the radar , Kat . No badge flashing , huh ? No having to explain to the local sheriff why we killed a man or why we got this babbling idiot in cuffs . I have to go home now . If I wander off , the Caretaker will come for me . I don 't think you need to worry about The Terminator , pal . Another movie thing . Put it in your queue . They can break my bones , but I will always mend . What are you ... He can recover from a broken neck ? I 'm your Caretaker now , and I will always keep you safe . No matter what . So , do you think Parish is the one who 's lactose intolerant ? Well , every Alpha has a downside . Maybe we finally found his . Look at you , making jokes . Maybe memory is his downside ? I mean , think about it . Why else would he keep an Alpha journal around unless his memory was slipping ? Right before my grandpa kicked it , he used to call me by the cat 's name . He was 70 . Parish is over 200 years old . Have you guys seen my keys ? I can 't find my keys . Yeah , Grandpa used to say that , too . Look at you smiling . Don 't hurt yourself . I 'm sorry . Geez , I suck at this . Hicks , look , thinking about Dani is messing you up . So , maybe ... Maybe you should just stop . Just stop . Or ... Yeah , you 'll feel much better if you just stop thinking about her . Man , you really don 't get it , do you ? I mean , for you , all you do is forget . So , I tell you what , come on , teach me . I wish I could . Um , I can help you . I can put you inside your memories with Dani . Shut the hell up , Mitchell . Hey ! Hey , come on , here 's the town . At least I don 't suck at directions . Okay , so , you remember , obviously , by rewiring here and here , Skylar increased the power . And made the effect of this device instantaneous . Oh , yeah . How could I forget ? Okay , so take a look . If you combine all the components of that factory shipment together , you could end up with a device that could replicate Skylar 's power boost . And conceivably increase the ability of hundreds of Alphas . All of whom believe in Parish 's cause . I 've got this . So I 'll hot-wire a car . We 'll be back in Manhattan in time for Jeopardy . Yeah , we could drive a stolen car back to the city or I could just head over there and rent one . Ha ! That 's why I keep you around . Always thinking . Yeah . Look , just keep him out of sight , all right ? Okay . Come on , let 's go . Get down . When am I going home ? Um , you 're gonna need a new home . I assume . I can 't give you all the details because it 's above my pay grade , but I 'm sure it 's gonna be awesome . Who is she ? Why can 't I remember ? I can help you , too . With a memory . If you want . Um , no thanks . I 'm kind of a hard nut to crack in that department . You sure ? There 's a woman in a blue dress . I think she might be my mom . If she 's in there , I can help you find her . Clorera has never let me down . Clorera has the strength to clean up life 's messes . Big or small . What the hell was that ? Where 's the rest of it ? Sorry . That 's all there is . No . No , that can 't be it . That can 't be all I have . I 'm sorry . I really am . I don 't have anything . I can 't even remember which are my memories anymore . Ms. Theroux . I 'd like to talk . I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm just going home . I spoke to Agent Cley about you . He said that you can put thoughts in people 's minds . Make them do things . I 'm not feeling very well . I need to ... Do they remember what you did ? Why do you ask , Senator ? Because I 've been pushed . At first I thought I was losing my mind . But when Parish 's attack came to light , I thought an Alpha could be responsible for my ... experience . An Alpha like you . I joined the task force because I need answers . I need to know if I was pushed by one of Parish 's people . By one of Parish 's ... I 'm questioning everything . Is what I 'm doing my decision or someone else 's ? I just want to trust myself again . You can . The person who did this to you isn 't in control of you anymore . Your mind is yours . How can you be sure ? I really need to go home . Charlotte , go home . You ... God , I hate the smell of docks . Must be worse for you , huh ? Actually , it 's not bothering me . I think I 've come to a Zen place with my senses . It 's like I 've finally found a balance between everything ... Between what ? Sex and what ? I know you 're having sex . That is none of your business . Yeah . Uh-huh . The manifest says industrial electronics . Hasn 't been inspected yet . Hasn 't been touched since it arrived yesterday . Still sealed . Maritime 's gone for the day . There 's nobody here to open this can for you . We could try a chop ... We got this , thanks . There are patterns in the dust . Boxes were here . Thousands of them . He has them . Parish already has them . Now , where did he take them ? Okay , I 'll do it . Do what , sweetheart ? I 'll come home and I 'll look after you . But I have a new schedule now . And I have pudding every day . We have to go and buy a load of pudding . Because I have it every afternoon . I should be having some right now , but I 'm here looking after you . We 'll make it work . I 'm ... I 'm glad you 're here . Oh , yeah . You 're welcome . Hey , hey , look . Oh , wait . You 're attached . That 's a step , right there . Oh ... Yeah . It 's banana . No banana ? I like blueberry . Well , I 'm sure if we ask the nurse , we can ... Well , I don 't ... I , oh , oh , Mom ? Mom ? Doctor . Mrs. Bell ? Is she okay ? Mrs. Bell . Can you hear me ? She was just , she was awake , talking to me . Can you hear me ? Mrs. Bell , you 're in the hospital . Can you say that for me ? Probably a CVA . Okay , get her on 94 % O2 , all right ? Page IR and tell them to prepare for angio and tPA . What is all that stuff ? And get him out of here , please . I 'm sorry , you have to go . What ? No , no . - What are those things ? - Okay . Is she okay , though ? I mean , she was just awake . Hang tough a little longer , now . Stay with me . I know you don 't approve . But she was living in fear because of what we did to her . I couldn 't leave her like that . It 's better that she 's scared of me than scared of herself . Better ? Nina , you of all people know that fear can make people do all sorts of unpredictable things . Letting her know was the right thing to do . All right . I 'll ... I 'll reach out to her and see what I can do to smooth things over . This is the person you wanted me to be . Dr. Rosen , Agent Cley needs you to take a look ... Not now . Excuse us . I need to speak with Dr. Rosen . Yes , ma 'am . I just finished combing through a raft of documents regarding the unconstitutional actions of your team . I believe the Attorney General will be extremely interested . Yes , I can imagine he would be . Your team is more dangerous than the Alphas they go after . And you ... You are the worst . You use them to assault innocents under a pretence of justice . Senator Burton , I apologize for pushing you . I can assure you we don 't do that without a lot of consideration . But the other option was to blackmail you with the illegal contribution to your first campaign , or that you had been compromised by Parish 's organization in regards to August Medical . So I decided to have Nina push you because I thought that was the gentler of the options . And I 'd like to think that I won 't regret that choice . And uh , yes , Senator , you are right . My team is dangerous and so am I. Hey , Kat , I got the car . So , uh , just meet me where I left you off , all right ? Where is he ? Hicks ? You ready ? - Let 's trade . - Oh , crap . Uh , look , Mr. Caretaker . I 'm not really authorized to make deals . You 've got five minutes to figure it out . I need to call you back . Shoot . Okay . Mitchell , I need you to focus . You are the Caretaker . How do you do your thing ? I 'm your Caretaker now . Mmm-hmm . And I will always keep you safe . Yeah , got that . I need the other side of the coin . The downside . How many times have I told you not to drink my milk , Mitchell ? Your system can 't handle it . Milk cartons . Okay , he needs a ton of calcium to help him heal . Which means , his osteoblasts would increase his bone density like crazy . Hey , Caretaker . Do you break a bathroom scale while you were healing ? Do you get , like , super heavy ? Have I ever tell you about the time I met McEnroe ? In Malibu . Super nice guy . - Yeah , you did . - My keys ... Okay , let 's swap . I 'll text you the longitude and latitude . Oh , so now you 're in charge ? Yeah , I pick the location because I have the leverage . How do you figure ? Well , if I lose Hicks I get yelled at . If you lose Mitchell , I 'm guessing you get a painful death . I really hope I know how to drive one of those things . How 's your mom ? She had another stroke . She had a little stroke and that 's why she crashed the car . Because normally she 's a good driver . But now , she had a bigger stroke . And she 's unconscious and the doctor doesn 't know when she 's gonna wake up again . Are you okay ? Yeah . Of course I 'm okay , Bill . I didn 't have a stroke . Hey , Mitchell ! Hey , Mitchell ! Mitchell , where you been , man ? I don 't know if I ever told you this , but uh , I actually used to run a fishing boat out of these very waters . Mitchell , where 's the girl you were with ? Concentrate on the present . The girl you were with just with . Where is she ? She drove off . She told me to walk . You know , these waters are pretty deep . And I used to high dive in water that was shallower than this . Mitchell , don 't go near the water . Hicks ? Hicks ! Oh , crap . He 's in the trunk , isn 't he ? Hand me that rock . Don 't go near the water , Mitchell . Quit flailing ! You seriously don 't know how to swim ? I 'm sorry . I was too busy learning how to pick locks under water . How 'd you know the Caretaker would sink ? He 's too heavy . When he 's healing , his bone density weighs him down . Remember the milk and the broken scale ? Yeah . It 's a science thing . Come on . Hello , Mitchell . I 'm Dr. Lee Rosen . I 'm very pleased to make your acquaintance . Dr. Rosen . He 's an arrogant bastard , but I like him . Those are Stanton Parish 's words , aren 't they ? Can you show me , um , the last time you spoke with Mr. Parish ? But I must never forget what I 'm feeling right now . I 've lost another someone who was very dear to me . Dani is dead . I am responsible for her death . I killed her . I sacrificed her . Well , I 'm sure it was for a good reason . You always make the right decision . That 's what you told me . Did I ? Did I say that ? Yeah . Well , I wish it were true . I don 't think I did . No , not this time . If I could have that moment back ... I can 't let her death be for nothing , can I ? I refuse to fail . Fail ? You 're all I have left now , Mitchell . I promise you , you will grow old in a better world than I have . This farmhouse is my home . I built it with my father . It 's where I raised my first family . Really , it 's the only place I feel at home . Those are my memories , Mitchell . Clorera has the strength to clean up life 's messes . May I ? Big or small . Hey , Kat , it 's your old buddy , Cam Hicks . And I just wanted to say , for the record , thanks for saving my life today . But , you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with . Hey , what I said before about if I could help you forget , I would ? I wouldn 't . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm great . It turns out the only memory I have of my life is some stupid commercial with a stupid actress . Look , you 're lucky to have your memories , even the ones that hurt . They let you know who you are . Well , I know who you are . You are the girl who can drive a rig and can pick a lock under water . I don 't know if I have the stomach for this . Come on , you 're an ace . That guy ... I killed him . And I don 't like how it feels . That was justified . Oh , was it ? I mean , he was just doing his job . Just trying to protect Mitchell . I killed a man today . And I don 't ever want to forget how that feels . So ? Did you get Parish 's plans ? No , Cameron , I didn 't . It seems that Parish doesn 't use him in that way . He talks to Mitchell about his feelings . The entire operation 's a bust . No . No , it 's not . It 's quite the contrary . I learned quite a bit in there . I learned that , uh , I have misjudged Mr. Parish . He 's not a sociopath . He cares quite deeply about this young man and he cares quite deeply about Dani . This humanity of his makes him vulnerable . That 's his weakness . And we are going to use it against him . I want my keys . Here , I was holding them for you . Mitchell didn 't do anything wrong . He doesn 't deserve to be there . I know . But Building Seven might very well be the best thing for him . At least his mind will be at peace there . Either way , you 're not gonna lose any sleep over it , are you ? Sleep ? What 's that ? Cameron , Mitchell is nothing more than a thread to be pulled . And Parish will unravel . Parish won 't let you keep Mitchell chipped . He 'll come for him . Let him come .

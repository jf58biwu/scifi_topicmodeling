 Previously on Caprice : [ Zoe ] I thought I knew my friends , but I guess I was wrong . For the one true God knows all and directs us all . [ all ] So say we all . - I 'm sorry , Z. It 's God 's will . - No ! Ben ... Amanda ] Did 5 really even know my daughter ? You think that Zoe knew one of the terrorists ? Dr Graystone , we think that Zoe might have been one of the terrorists . [ Joe ] Daniel Graystone says he can bring my daughter back . But can 5 trust him ? The device that I need is called a Meta-Cognitive Processor . There 's only one company that has this device , and it 's not mine . I need something stolen . From the Vergil Corporation , on Tarpon . - Daddy ? - It 's OK , baby . I 'm right here . - My heart isn 't beating . - I miss you . Daddy , my heart isn 't beating . My baby . She couldn 't feel her heartbeat . Danielle My daughter died in the MAGLEV bombing , but she continues to exist in the virtual World . - Hi , Daddy . - You 're an avatar . - A virtual representation of Zoe . - I don 't feel like a copy , Daddy . What are you doing to her ? Stop it , Dr Graystone ! Stop ! - [ Lacy ] What did you do to her ? - [ Daniel ] I captured her avatar . She 's in here now . [ virtual Zoe ] Daddy . Daddy . Daddy ? Zoe I - [ virtual Zoe ] Lacy ? - Who is this ? We me , Zoe . And I think I 'm gonna need your help . - [ Virtual Zoe ] Come here . - [ barks ] Come here . - Who is it ? Who are we going to meet ? - You 'll see . See this infinity symbol ? It 's the symbol of the Soldiers of the One . We 're the ones who are gonna bring the word of the one true God to the people . Ben . Ben , there 's someone here I 'd like you to meet . She 's perfect . She 'll do it . It 's all going to change . You 're a gift , and everyone will know it soon . Powering down . What are you talking about ? It 's been working great in the demos for defense . - Beyond expectations . - This chip in this chassis works great . But take it out , put it in any of the other bodies and it 's a moron . - Is that true ? - Yes , it 's true . Put this chip in any other body and it doesn 't innovate , doesn 't anticipate . All the bodies are identical , but the MOP only works in this one . That can 't be . The bodies are functionally isomorphic . It can 't know which one it 's in . Is this it ? Is this the one ? Wait . Is this the same one I was working on ? Is this the prototype ? Right . We don 't know why it 's happening . In fact , when we put copies of the MOP in other bodies , we expected them to bond too , but , no , they 're all morons . There 's something unique about the bonding of this chip and body . If we don 't figure out how to replicate it , this whole contract is in danger . So the military liaison , he 's all over me ... I get the problem . I 'm gonna miss the jump . Tell you what . Have this whole thing sent to my home lab . - I 'll take a look at it this weekend . - Take care of it . - Hey , Serge ? - Yes , Amanda . I know we have some old home movie tiles of Zoe . - Will you help me find them ? - Right away . [ school bell rings ] Lacy . Did you get my invitation ? Uh ... Right , uh ... Saturday . Lunch at your house . I haven 't been to a teacher 's house before . Well , we do eat . Can I expect you ? Um , yeah . - Yes . - Good . Phone weeps ] Zoe ? What 's going on ? It 's been two days . Two ? My God , I 'm losing track . I 've been having these dreams , my life and the original Zoe 's life all mixed up . Listen , Sister Clarice invited me to her house for lunch tomorrow . - She can help us . - No . The only control that I have right now is that no one knows I 'm in here . Promise me you won 't tell . OK . I promise . They 're taking me to the lab in Zoe 's house . Once I 'm there , I might be able to do something . I 'm gonna try to get Zoe 's original program ... - [ indistinct voices ] - Frank . Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe ? - Great piece of engineering . - Yeah , I know . She gives me the chills . She ? Dude , stop feminizing it . It 's weird . - [ laughs ] - It 's unnatural . There 's nothing wrong with feminizing it . Nothing wrong except it 's not a person . It 's useful . Just a tool . The STEW espouses a monotheistic religious philosophy , advocating the worship of a single all-knowing , all-powerful God . { man ] One month after the MAGLEV bombing , giddy agents continue to interrogate ...

I accidentally went to his sister 's school . [ technician ] Phil , aren 't you done with that thing already ? OK , just move your right elbow up by about 45 degrees . Now rotate your hand 9 degrees . We could have disassembled it and loaded it twice by now . - OK . Now move your right arm . - It 's equipment . A few donors to the right . It 's a work of art . It deserves some dignity . OK , so if you move your forearm about three donors to the right . - OK , great .

It 's about Ben Stark . We 're looking at any other known associates ... I don 't know a Ben Stark . I 've never even heard that name . - Was he the real bomber ? - Really ? Ben Stark ? Doctor , he was your daughter 's boyfriend . Take a look at the picture . My daughter didn 't have a boyfriend . She wasn 't old enough . She died before ... Good night . [ technician ] Let 's get this thing inside already and call it a day . [ Phil ] I can 't believe he 's getting us to come to the lab . He like never ... [ technician ] It 's insane . Frank ! Frank ! - What do we do , man ? What do we do ? - You stay here . You distract her and ... - Distract her ? Where are you going ? - Just be ... Philemon ! Frank ! Frank ! What 's going on ? Pull the chip . Pull the MOP . - Hey . You just relax . - [ technician ] Pull it ! - I 'm not gonna hurt you . - [ technician ] Hurry up ! All right ? I 'm sorry . You got it ? - I got it . - We good ? Yeah , we 're good . If you just wouldn 't think about what it is , you 'd like it . It 's not that I don 't like it . I 'm full . - Yeah , sure . - [ Willie ] It 's true . - You haven 't eaten all day . Eat some . - [ Willie ] I 'm full . I can 't eat . Maybe later we can go out for some burgers . - I might not be full then . - I won 't make another Tarpon meal . - No . It 's just ... - I understand . Help me clear the table . Come on . You can do that at least . Come on , come on . Would you bring the other plates in ? What 's the matter , your legs broken ? Daddy . [ Phil ] I wonder why it would freak out like that . Didn 't have any sensory re-afferent under the cover . Thrashed around to replace the input . Went nuts , just like a little kid would . Yeah ? That 's totally cool of it . Yeah , it is , actually . This robot , she 's doing all kinds of things I never thought I 'd see her do . Huh ? Even the way it moves . It 's like you can see it think . Oh , look at that . It 's all out of whack . Stupid thing must have done it in the van . - Yeah , I 'll run a diagnostic . - No , no . I got it . Still gonna run it . Hold still . - Oh , flaw . - Ah ... Hafiz you do ' ? - Frank ! - Oh , my God . - Hospital , hospital . Come on , let 's go . - Get the tip ! Get my fingertip ! - Where 'd it go ? - I don 't know . Over there somewhere ! - Oh , my gods . - Hurry up ! Come on ! Found it . - All right . - Oh , man , I 'm dizzy . [ Phil ] You 're OK . You 're OK . [ Amanda ] Lacy . I 've been wandering around looking for your house . I thought I 'd remember it . Yeah , it 's not very memorable . You OK ? Hard day at school . Um , listen ... Can I talk to you about Zoe ? I 'm just trying to figure her out , you know ? [ woman ] Lacy , get in here ! [ Amanda ] Lacy . What was she running away from ? Was it from us ? From me ? I don 't really know . She just said that there 'd be a new family waiting for us on Gemenon . - A new family ? - Sorry . It 's the last thing I heard her say . A new family . So the problem with the MOP is that it 's only gonna work in this one body . I ... And I think , uh , I think the MOP ls diffusing some of its control to the peripheral subunits of this ... of this particular model . So we 've made exactly one solider ? Yeah , but , uh ... it 's a really good one . I 'm glad you like it , but our contract is for 100,000 robots , Phil . [ knocking ] Hi . I couldn 't find the address and I forgot to bring , like , anything . Don 't be silly . You 're perfect . Come on in . We 're just about to sit down . Come on , let 's meet everyone . Whoops .

It 's about time somebody in this family brought home someone interesting . - Nice to meet you . - Come on . - Is he , like , your son ? - No . Nestorius my husband . He 's young enough to be my son , but I 'm not married to all these people . Some of them are friends . These are my wives . This is Mar-Beth and Helena . And Desiree Willow . We use her surname . And my husbands . There 's Nestor and Tanner and Olaf and Rash awn . - I don 't know where the others are . - Hi . I knew a few kids from group marriages . It 's cool . Kids , turn that TV off .

My mom 's kind of formal . And here everyone 's so comfortable with everyone . I heard how you lost your friends . You must miss them so much . Um , Zoe Graystone was Lacy 's best friend . - Oh . - A real tragedy for all of us . She was very special . I mean , she was brilliant . At computer stuff , right ? That 's my major . Did you know that there are bits of software that you use every day that were written decades ago ? Is that true ? That 's amazing . You write a great program and it can outlive you . It 's like a work of art , you know ? Maybe Zoe was an artist . Maybe her work will live on . Mm . [ man ] We 're back from the break and we 're gonna take a look around the league right now real quickly , starting off with a team that 's had a surprisingly poor showing early in the season , the Caprice City Buccaneers ... . HEY - . HEY - Working hard , I see . I 'm letting the old subconscious find the answers . Off . Oh , gods . Think I saw this guy in a movie once . He was trampling Oran . What a monster . Horrible . Um , so , listen ... - Tomorrow 's the memorial . - Yeah . - I was thinking maybe we should go . - Uh ... I 'm sorry , sweetheart . I just ... I can 't . I got a picky robot .

Serge ] Mr Joseph Adama is at the main gate requesting entry . Denied . - Thank you . - It was a pleasure . See you soon . This isn 't a spectator sport , you know . You can help . What was that ? Tanner ] What 's going on with Nestor and that girl ? Are you and Nestor trying to ... Nestor , did I ask you to seduce Lacy Rand ? [ laughs ] What ? No . Look , I understand how hard it 's been for you to ... to lose your student ... - The bombings got us all on edge . - You can 't blame us for wondering . I mean , given your track record . My track record ? If a student suffers a loss , I help them . The girl 's lost her only friends . I 've done nothing wrong . And if you 'd wipe the slate clean , you 'd see that . - We do , of course . - We know how hard you work . Look , I can 't ... Do you mind if I beg off the rest of the clean-up ? I 'm going for a walk . [ Daniel ] Sudden death . Graystone steps up to the line and ... Graystone eyes the shot , sees the angle . Goal ! What do you say to that , Serge ? We 've been over this . - The crowd goes franking wild , sir . - Thank you . They 're tearing up the seats . Ifs bedlam . Thank you . Thank you . They demand another hour of game time , sir . Well ... Let 's fix this thing . The same body . Same body this whole time . So why is this one different ? I put her in there ... and she 's gone . But where ? Where ? She 's not in the mainframe . Where did you go ? [ sighs ] So if she 's not in there , then ... [ sighs ] ... why can 't we copy you ? Nice car . Looks like skoal , but it 's got 350 under the hood , a triple-mounted clutch , which most knucklehead tell you is a bad thing . But if you know anything about cars , you 'll realise that what you really want is a triple C with an under mount wedge . That way you got control and power , and it 's all about control and power . All right , let 's go . Come on , Willie , let 's go ! Walk , walk , walk . - You smashed a window . - Don 't worry about it . - You just broke a window . - Relax , relax . - Crap , there 's the cops . - All right , stick around , stick around . Don 't run . You run away , you 're guilty of two things . The thing and the running away from the thing . Just follow me . - Sam Adama . - Officer Mendez . - You know what to do . - I certainly do . - [ Willie ] Whoa , hey . - Let him cuff you . Relax . It 's OK . What are you doing , Sam , running a criminal school ? Yeah . You wanna join ? Better pay , top benefits . - I think I 'm good . - You think about it . - Transport for two . - Don 't panic . All right ? They give us a phone call . I take care of the whole thing , OK ? - Yeah , how , with some kind of bribe ? - Frank , say it louder , kid . No . You just pay the fine , all right ? It drives them crazy . They don 't tell you about the option of paying . You gotta know these things . - You listening ? - Yes , I 'm listening . Give in on the little things , they miss the big things . You remember that . It 's good advice . [ Z ] Lacy . Do not point that camera at me . Can We switch ? Zoe } AH right . OK , OK . This is it , Lace . Our lives are about to change forever . Do you really believe what you 're saying ? Yes , S do . I believe how beautiful I am too . Stop . - [ sighs ] - [ footsteps approach ] Why do you wanna go to the memorial ? - Why ? - I don 't even know that I do . Because I ... I don 't want to think about her . I know it sounds awful , but it 's ... it 's true . I don 't ... I don 't wanna think ... I don 't ... Oh ! I don 't wanna think . I just feel awful and ... [ sighs ] ... angry and numb and ... Angry at who ? Everybody and everything . Myself and the world . Her . The robot . The robot didn 't do anything . No , it didn 't . I 'm just ... going a little crazy . - Oh , really ? - [ laughs ] Yeah . - What 's that like , huh ? - Oh , like you don 't know . I sure love you . And if you still wanna go to the memorial , I 'd go with you . OK ' ? Because you 're ready to think ? Because I promised Serge some time alone with the U-87 . I think he 's got a little ... crush . - No . - It 's not pretty . It 's not a pretty thing , but they need to be alone . [ Willie ] I still can 't believe they just let us go . - I told you that was some good advice . - Yeah . - Hey , wanna hear some more ? - Sure . Someone tries to make you feel guilty , you figure out what they feel guilty about , you talk about that . Mm . Also , don 't smoke . You know why ? Uh , ' cause it 's bad for you maybe ? No . Life 's bad for you . You don 't smoke because they can get genetic data off a cigarette butt now . Yeah . Hey , listen , um , don 't tell your dad I told you that , OK ? Mom , you gotta get ' em in the thing or they don 't take ' em . Phone weeps ] - Hello ? - [ Zoe ] Lacy . - Yes . - Ifs Zoe . Pm at { he house . I need you . It 's important . Oh , my God . There something you wanna tell me ? Despoil Kolas called . She thought you might be sick ' cause you didn 't show up for class today . Tarpon school 's boring . It 's about us . Finding out who you are . It 's about being Tarpon . Being part of a family . It 's hard being part of a family , Dad , when there is no family . But you can punish me if you want . Come here . He ' ! - [ sniffs ] Mm . - Very nice . - Haven 't seen you here before . It 's been a while . You 've come to the right place to fall off the wagon . Yeah , right . I need , um , privacy , a smoker and two grams of purple . Right . I couldn 't believe when you said you were here . Is it really ... It 's ... It 's me . Lacy . Lacy , it 's me . It 's OK . You can take a good look . [ Lacy ] Wow . So ... this is you . Your arms and ... and ... your face . Your voice comes out of here ? And ... and ... you see here . Look at your arms . Lacy , you gotta tell me , do I look male to you ? - Yeah . - Frank . But you 're here , walking in the real world . Just like Zoe said you would . First time I 've ever seen you in the real world ever . Yeah , but I 'm trapped . I get manhandled and ordered around . They loaded me like cargo . One guy touched me and I hurt him , Lacy . God . I ... I don 't know how to help you . - What are you gonna do ? - I 've already started some of it . I went into the computer and checked . Zoe 's original program was destroyed when he put me in here . So at least he won 't be putting any more of me in more robots . God , it 's confusing . I mean , I 'm Zoe and the avatar and the robot , like some kind of , what you call it , three-patter ... Trinity . That 's what you are . Three faces of one thing . Sort of . - Zoe ... - My mom called me a monster . To be fair ... [ man ] .. I think I could live with this much better . [ man 2 ] My son overslept , so he had to take the train instead of walking . Ir I 'd just ... - Do you wanna say something ? - Gods , no . What would I say ? [ sighs ] I think I see some parents from the school . We should say hello . No , no . Sweetheart , please don 't talk to people . You 'll be everyone 's shoulder to cry on . I 'll never get you out of here . Please . Or you could say nothing all day long . Is that better ? He liked to walk . He would have thanked me if I woke him up . [ Amanda sighs ] [ man ] But I didn 't do it . [ woman ] I told Mom she was getting too old to take the Le . I don 't understand how something like this could have happened . I love you , Mom , and I 'm so sorry . - [ woman ] Amanda Graystone ? - Yes . Natalie Stark . Ben 's mom . Zoe 's boyfriend . [ man ] There were people everywhere asking for help , but I didn 't know what to do for them . I was in the back car , and we were all shook up . So you don 't return phone calls . It 's OK . Sean , it 's OK . Why don 't you go get a drink ? [ sighs ] Yeah , I 'm sorry about the calls , but , uh ... it 's been ... it 's been crazy at work . You sent your bodyguard away . You 're either very confident I 'm not gonna hurt you or you 're afraid I 'm gonna talk about a certain theft . I 've gone through his room and there were things Zoe left . Costume jewellery , school papers . I thought you 'd want them . He loved her very much . - I 'm sorry . - Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Oh ! Durham ] A group known as Soldiers of the One has claimed responsibility for the bombing . Now , as I 'm sure you all know , the STEW espouses a monotheistic religious philosophy . Dr Graystone , we think that Zoe might have been one of the terrorists . [ woman ] A purse-snatcher , yes , but a bomb ? I don 't understand how something like this could have happened . - Well , if you wanna talk , we can talk . - I need to see her again . - Call my office . We 'll set up a time . - I need to see Tamara . The Tamara that you made . She 's gone . She 's gone . It was a beta test . I went back in to iron out some of the kinks and Zoe 's avatar was gone . So because Zoe 's gone , you know Tamara 's gone ? It makes sense they would disappear at the same time . What ? She didn 't disappear when I took that band off ? No . From her point of view , you disappeared , not her . So she might be all alone in there , not knowing where I went ? - Maybe stuck between dead or alive . - [ Amanda ] Every one of you ... Not knowing what she is or why her heart doesn 't beat . [ Amanda ] .. that 's come up here today has talked about how much you miss the people that you lost . I do miss Zoe . I miss her with every breath , but I don 't really know what it is that I 'm missing . My daughter had a whole life and a boyfriend that I knew nothing about . Beliefs that I don 't ... I don 't understand at all . Hey , Grandma , have you seen my Pyramid game ? No , dear . - Looking back , I think that she ... - Shh ! ... only showed me what she wanted me to see . I just didn 't know her . You 've all talked about how guilty you feel . It 's our job , we create life and then one day We have to face who they are what they become and what they do . My daughter , Zoe Graystone , died in the bombing of MAGLEV train number 23 . But I think she may have caused it . [ shouting ] [ crowd muttering ] This was hers . [ gasping ] I found this . My daughter was part of the Soldiers of the One . - [ shouting ] - Sean . Sean , get over here . Have Dale bring the car . My daughter was a terrorist ! I 'm sorry . My daughter was part of the Soldiers of the One . She was a terrorist . Get back ! Drive , drive , drive , drive , drive ! - Killers ! - Murderers !

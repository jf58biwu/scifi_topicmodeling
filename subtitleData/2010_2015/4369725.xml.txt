 Previously on Fringe : You 're looking through a window into another world . An alternate universe just like ours . And in each of them , there is a version of us . - I can 't let Peter die again . - Walter , Peter is dead . I 'm talking about the other Peter . The one on the Other Side . I crossed into another universe and took a son that wasn 't mine . Agent Dunham , I work for the FBI in Fringe Division dealing with weird and mysterious events . These men are consultants . Peter Bishop and Walter Bishop . - Hello , Dr. Bishop . - Newton . What do we know ? William Bell told me that Newton would try to open a doorway from our universe to the Other Side . - I 'm not from here , am I ? - Son , there 's ... I am not your son . - I can take you back where you belong . - Peter is in danger . Help us cross over . Walter here is the Secretary of Defense . The Fringe team answers to him . Invaders from another universe . They 're our doubles . They can 't be trusted . You gotta trust me . I 'm you . What is it ? Something to heal the problems of this world . His bringing me back was never about fixing this universe . It was about destroying yours . They 're heading back to the opera house . Make the switch . Welcome back . I know you can hear me ! Please let me out of here . We 'd get through the foundation a lot quicker with that pickaxe . Where 's your dumb cousin ? He ain 't dumb . And don 't worry about him . Just keep working . - What do you think 's in it ? - Ain 't our job to think . It 's our job to dig . We 're getting paid a lot of money for this . It 's gotta be something valuable . That 's the kind of thinking that found us trouble in Texas . Yeah , but we made a lot of money back in Texas . Maybe just a peek . I have everything you need for your new identity . Agent Olivia Dunham . Joined the Fringe Division September 9th , 2008 . And you also got files on both Bishops , Broyles , Bell , and Farnsworth . Where 'd you get all this ? I 've been here since you were in high school . I 've cultivated a lot of resources . Anything you need , just ask . - Ha , ha . The History of Pop Culture . - That 's your homework . It will help familiarize you with this world . - lf you could move your hair to the side . - Yeah . Don 't worry , you won 't feel a thing . - Who 's " Bono " ? - Oh , it 's Bono , actually . - He 's a musician . - Oh , yeah ? Is he any good ? One of the few I like on this side . Well , he 's easy on the eyes . Careful . Their side may be alluring but don 't be taken in by it . They started the war , remember . You don 't have to remind me whose side I 'm on . - Did you do what I told you ? - I hired a team and sent it to the site . - Your usual men ? - No . I don 't want to burn my resources . Does that meet with your approval ? I don 't care how long you 've been here , this is my operation . You work for me . Indeed . " Dr. Bell 's company was known for tackling the most advanced technological problems . He will long be remembered as one of our country 's leading visionaries . " It 's a bit generic , don 't you think ? He was my best friend . Wherever he is , he 'll be very disappointed . We 're low on butter . Butter ? Right . Coming up . And you think this is , what ? Some sort of doomsday machine ? Well , Walternate said that it was a very powerful piece of ancient tech . He spent the last few years looking for the component pieces . - But he 's finished assembling it ? - No . He was missing several of them . Including one very important one . - Me . - You think this is accurate ? That you somehow can power this device ? The device seemed to need a specific human interface . And this piece responded directly to me . If that 's true , if Walternate needs you to operate this weapon ... We know that he has agents on this side . If he wanted me back , they would have made a play . - There has to be some other plan . - These cacao beans . They 're inedible . Gene will never be able to digest them . She 's a cow , Walter . She could probably digest the frying pan . - What is he doing ? - You don 't want to know . I 'm trying to make chocolate milk . Or rather I 'm trying to make the cow make chocolate milk . Dr. Bishop do you have an idea why this machine would or could be configured for Peter ? Why it would respond to him ? - This machine is dangerous . - Which is why we need to understand it . - lf it is indeed a threat ... - To ignore it would be irresponsible . I 've heard that argument before . That 's what you people told Oppenheimer when you discovered the Nazis were working on a bomb . And how do you think he slept after his little invention had killed hundreds of thousands in a fraction of a second ? I need to go back to the market . Aspirin ! We need to go to the market . - Is he okay ? - Well , he 's Walter . Define " okay . " - Hi . - Do you need anything from the market ? No , thank you . Peter , I know you and Walter have been through a lot . But if this is the threat we think it is , we need Walter focused . What if he 's right ? What if we shouldn 't be working on this thing ? - You ready ? - Yeah . Been back for two days and Walter 's already driving you to drink ? Can you blame me ? Sometimes I feel like I 'm stuck in one of those bad buddy-cop movies . - Like I 'm handcuffed to a ... - A mad scientist who kidnapped you from another universe ? - Yeah , exactly . You know , I understand Walter 's concern about the weapon but I think Broyles is right . We need to figure out what it does . - And we can 't do that without Walter . - Another ? I love this song . - Really ? - Don 't you ? Well , no , it 's a great song , I just ... As long as I 've known you , I 've never heard you express an interest in music . I 've been noticing a lot of things since we 've been back . Being over there , meeting another Olivia Dunham made me think about the way I look at the world . The choices I 've made . Come on . - Are you serious ? - Yeah , come on . What , you 're one of those guys that doesn 't like to dance ? - Love me as long as you wanted Nothing like seeing another version of yourself to give you a little perspective . I gotta tell you , it was strange . Being with the other you . Like looking into one of those carnival mirrors . - You didn 't like the red hair ? - Well , I 've always preferred blondes . But you did make a very sexy redhead . Good . The more I think about being over there , the less real it seems . But you , you still feel real . Hmm . Dunham . A neighbor found them a few hours ago . ME puts the time of death around 10 last night . What are you thinking ? Nothing . Just taking it in . - Dr. Bishop , any thoughts ? - Reminds me of Monet 's Water Lilies . - The painting ? - It 's a pastel . Look at the blood . It 's a shade lighter than ordinary . Blood 's mixed with something else . Possibly spinal fluid . So where are the men who tied them up ? Neither of them had ID . Techs are taking prints . Seem to have been in some type of vegetative trance before they expired . So you 've seen something like this before ? No . Nostradamus is said to have died standing up . But I doubt that someone who predicted his own death wouldn 't have laid down . Whatever did this didn 't kill them right away . It 's a hypothesis . But we are yet to find our Rosebud . The elusive clue that will unlock the mystery . - Anyone locate what they were after ? - We don 't know what they 're after . - Beware of buried treasure . - We 're thinking there was a third thief . Unless of course this buried treasure had legs of its own . Ha , ha . Wouldn 't that be delightful ? - Any leads on the third man ? - No , not yet . I was just in Milton . We got a problem . Your little plan wasn 't so foolproof . The device was supposed to be there , right ? It wasn 't . One of your men must have taken it . Two died like you planned but the other survived and took the device . I only hired two men . That 's them . If there were three , all should be dead . - No one can withstand that thing . - Someone did . We need to find him . - That sound creeps me out . - Really ? I 've always found it oddly comforting . Oh , that 's very good , dear . Have you ever worked behind a deli counter ? Walter , your tie . I , uh , think you have a little bit of brain on it . Here , let me ... It 's raspberry jam . Walter . It 's time to go . - Can you give us just a minute ? - Maybe I 'm overdressed . - Maybe I should change anyway . - Walter , you look fine . No , I don 't think I can do this . Walter it 's gonna be okay . You look lovely . This place makes me feel so insignificant . I read that they invented a wheelchair that can be steered by brainwaves alone . Some sort of micro-electrode technology . Walter . Peter . We 're set up in my office . Nina . I know that this has been a great loss to you , as well . " My great friend Isaac once said , 'Life is joy death is peace . It 's transition that 's difficult . ' I was not a man of many friends . But if I 'd had hundreds , I would still cherish the two of you most . Nina I was your right hand , and you were mine . For the many hours we spent exploring the impossible , a small thank you . And for the precious few we had alone in Tuscany a memento of me . Walter . We gather knowledge faster than we gather wisdom . By now , I trust you have ample reserves of both . I hope you 've forgiven me . " Thus concludes the last will and testament of William Bell . Thank you all for coming . So you gonna tell me ? What ? About the letter ? No . I don 't think so . - Hello ? - Dunham 's not picking up . - Are you two at Blake 's apartment yet ? - I 'm not with Dunham . - Who 's Blake ? - One of men we found in the basement . We got a fingerprint hit on him . She didn 't call ? No , she didn 't . Hey . - Hey . Broyles called you ? - Yeah . Sorry . I know you don 't want to babysit but I knew Walter had a big day today . And if I called , you 'd come . - Blake 's got a friend living here ? - Looks that way . Although there 's nothing to tell us who he is . I was just gonna look for the landlord , see what he knows . Maybe you could do another once-over , in case I missed something . - It 's Dunham , you got a pen ? - I do now . 1200 Remington Place , Cambridge . Bishop and I will be gone in 30 minutes . I need you there then . You gotta bring this guy in . Walter ? How was the reading of the will ? You know , there 's a South American centipede that 's been known to crawl through the nasal passages and wreak this kind of havoc . Do you think that a bug could have killed all five victims ? And disrupted the electronics in the house ? Probably not . - Hey . Hey . - These damn things . Walter . Is everything okay ? No . This is from Bell ? It 's a key to a safety deposit box . It 's an old argument . Belly and I spent days discussing the wisdom of crossing the line . " Only those that risk going too far can possibly know how far they can go . " - That 's what Belly used to say . - So you were the cautious one ? He was over there . He saw what I did . All that I destroyed . How can he tell me to cross the line ? Walter , you saved Peter 's life . I know that there were consequences but Peter has got to understand why you made the choices you made . You 've talked to him , haven 't you ? - I 've been waiting for the right moment . - You were gonna do that days ago . He has got to hear your side of the story . Endolymph fluid . There was severe damage to the inner ear . Pass me a swab , please . I think I know what happened here . - Walter , I can 't find the requiem . - Perhaps her Don Giovanni ? So you think that music killed these people ? Not music per se . Could you help me with this please , my dear ? What about this ? Would that work ? Figaro . Perfect ! We 've known for some time that different sounds affect the brain in different ways . Look at my brainwaves On the monitor-o They 're smoothing out . Harmonic music reduces neural activity . Which is why we think more clearly when we listen to it . As opposed to this ! Dissonance . Look . Look at my neurons . Look at my neurons . Okay , we get it , Walter . Can I turn this off now ? Sorry . Sorry . You see , the point is this : With this type of auditory phenomena taken to its ultrasonic extreme , can be fatal . Um , and the way it effects the brain , it could well have induced some type of vegetative trance before death . Which would also explain the trauma to the inner ear . We 're looking for some kind of deadly music box ? No , you wouldn 't be able to hear it . - The frequency is too high . - Silent but deadly . Speaking of which , you might like to take a step away . Delightful , Walter . Any ideas why it didn 't affect the third man ? - Maybe headphones of some sort ? - They 'd need to be very sophisticated . I 'm gonna call Broyles , have him monitor the city for abnormal ultrasonic activity . Walter . Go talk to him . All the victims were patients of Dr. Laxmeesh Nayak . He ran , uh , an outpatient clinic in Seattle . Nayak was ostensibly treating his patients as part of a clinical trial for sleep disorders . You have photographic memory . How am I gonna do that ? You don 't move unless I tell you to . Got it ? Okay . Step inside . Put the box down . On the bench . Slowly . Please don 't hurt me , Mrs. Dunham . You 're deaf . Yeah , that 's why you didn 't die . I 'll call Olivia . Thanks . Peter . May I have a moment ? Sure . What 's up ? I , uh ... Today , when I said goodbye to Belly it was hard . Very hard . Sure it was . - I 'm ... I 'm sorry if I wasn 't ... - No , not that . What I 'm trying to say is that it was nothing . Nothing compared to saying goodbye to my son . - Walter , I gotta call ... - Peter . You need to hear this . When Peter my Peter died I lost all hope . The only thing that kept me alive was Elizabeth and my window into your world . I always told Belly that we couldn 't cross over , that it was far too dangerous . But when I saw that you were dying too and that I was the only one who could save you ... You kidnapped me , Walter . You took me from my family , from my world . I didn 't plan to , that was not my intention . I love you , Peter . And if I had to make the choice all over again I am not sure that I 'd be strong enough to act differently . But now I understand that it was wrong . That I should never have crossed the line . That it was terribly wrong . I can 't talk about this yet , Walter . He saw my badge outside of Blake 's apartment . He thought he was bringing the box to the authorities . I 'll come back after I 'm done to help you with him . It 's too bad he 's not blind . If you need me to take care of him ... No , you can just do your job . Make sure you don 't screw it up this time . I 'm sorry . - Peter ? - Hey . Did I come at a bad time ? - Hey , you want me to come back later ? - No , not at all , I , uh ... I just got out of the shower . So can you just give me a minute ? Sorry . I should 've called before I came over . Hey . - Mind if I come in ? - Sure . So Walter apologized to me . I know it wouldn 't take much . A few words , a hug , a couple hands of UNO . Anything would make the man feel better at this point . But I just can 't bring myself to do it . Sometimes I can 't even look the guy in the eye . You two have been through a lot . You can 't expect to go back to the way it was overnight . We all know this has been hard on you , Peter . No , you have no idea . I saw what Walter did . I saw all the quarantine zones . I saw all the damage that he caused . He destroyed their world , my world . Well , he couldn 't have known how bad it was gonna be . Yeah . It 's not like they gave him a picture of himself with fireballs coming out of his eyes strapped into a doomsday machine . You didn 't come here to talk about Walter , did you ? I can 't close my eyes without seeing that picture . And whatever is in those blueprints is my connection to that machine . What if they 're right ? What if that machine does exactly what Broyles and Walter think it does ? Is that my destiny , my fate ? Am I supposed to destroy worlds too ? I 'll be honest with you , I don 't want to turn out like Walter . Peter , the truth is I 'm scared too . The last few weeks have been hard on all of us . You know , of course there 's always the temporary fix . The temporary fix ? Distraction . - Hello . - Hi . What 's this ? It 's , um ... It 's a box . Well , what 's in it ? As with most things in life , the reality would pale in comparison with one 's imagination . And isn 't it better to wonder ? Would you keep an eye on the box while I go to the rest room ? Is there , you know , remuneration ? Of course . There you go . - I won 't be a minute . - Okay . - Astrid . - Broyles . Well , that can 't be a good sign . Kent Street . I frequented a massage parlor just around the corner . I used to get off right here . Sure hope you 're talking about the station , Walter . Got five more victims , maybe more unaccounted for . Mobile but unresponsive . They 're in some kind of trance . Lieutenant ! I want every subway station in Boston evacuated . Security cameras picked up a small man walking into the tunnel carrying a metallic box . These people seem to be suffering from the same symptoms as the victims at Milton . Yes , we 're thinking the box might be what the thieves dug up there . - What about the trains ? - System runs on a computer . We 've logged in and stopped all trains going into the tunnel . Bomb squad 's ready to deploy a man in the tunnel . Bomb squad ? This thing 's not a bomb . You send men in , they get killed . The tunnel leads to another station . If the box is mobile , we stop it . - You have a better idea ? - Yeah , I 'll go . Peter , you can 't , it 's too dangerous . The box is our responsibility , Walter . - lf I can get in front of it , I can disarm it . - No . I haven 't had time to devise something to protect you from the sound . Your boys have some ear protection . The frequencies are ultra-sonic . Simple noise cancellation won 't work ! I have to disable all impulses along the cochlear nerve . My men are standing by , agents . Peter , I have to make a call here . What is it , Walter ? The science is tenuous to say the least . Walter , if you have a way to put me in front of that box , tell me . Walter , talk to me . Agent Dunham we 're going to need your gun . - Mic test , one , two ... - So how long have I got ? I don 't know . If you can hear us talking , it 's too late . Well , ballpark it for me , Walter . Maximum ? Three minutes . You ready ? Do it . I see it . Oh , my God . I know what this is . It 's a piece of the weapon . I recognize it from Walternate 's blueprints . The weapon from the Other Side ? How is that possible ? Looks like the box was soundproof , but it 's broken . I can 't close it . I 'm gonna try to disarm it . He hasn 't spoken for 71 seconds . Something is wrong . His hearing could come back at any time . We need to send someone in . I can 't send another man in there . He could be hurt , he could be dying ! Hey ! Guys . - Do you hear that ? - I thought all the trains were stopped ! The device affected the subway 's communication system . Dunham , wait , you can 't go in there ! For a catastrophic explosion like that I imagine he had some sort of surgical implant . Dental ceramic crowns , if they were to vibrate at just the right resonant frequency ... Always hated the dentist . - You 're sure this is part of the weapon ? - Yeah . It looks just like the parts I saw on the Other Side . We know Walternate has agents here . Maybe they 're looking for the pieces . The ones he couldn 't find over there . Why would there be pieces on our side ? You got a better explanation ? We 're talking about two universes here . Two of each one of us . At this point , would anything really surprise you ? Bacon-flavored pudding . That would surprise me . I 'd like to take this back to the lab . We got the blueprints . Maybe I can figure it out . Okay . I guess you 've got other plans for tonight . Yeah . - Do you mind ? - Of course not . Today was a bad day . But it could have been a lot worse . Your quick thinking saved a lot of lives , Dr. Bishop . Good work . Walter . Hi . I know what Belly left me . Oh ? He left me Massive Dynamic . I 'm the sole shareholder .

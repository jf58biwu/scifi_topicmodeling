I mean , that 's incredible . I , uh ... I have a super sensitive palate . [ Chuckles ] Well , I was thinking that ...

Fine , but if you suddenly decide to spill , just remember I have plans tonight . - I won 't spill . - Rach ... Morning , everyone . I come bearing gifts . - Oh ! Let me open it . - All right . - Let me open it , please . - No , I want to- - oh , yeah , let me open it , please . The sound of red tape being cut , courtesy of Agent Sullivan . - Oh , it 's badges ! - That 's official cover , right ? Nail on the head , Cameron . I get to keep this one , it 's my photo . Apparently we all get one . Now we both have badges , Bill . - DCIS ? - It 's a real agency . Agent Sullivan said this is gonna help us with our " investigatory hurdles . " I thought I was the answer to our " investigatory hurdles . " Eh , here 's yours , Bill . What does " DCIS " even stand for ? It says . It 's " Defense Criminal Investigative Service . " Yeah . Still no idea . - Hello , this is Sahra Pirzad- - - Rachel . Oh , sorry . I 'm interrupting . No , no , it 's fine . Please , come in . Was that that Sam fellow ? Does everybody here know everything about my life ? It 's an office , Rachel , that 's what happens . You know , people watch out for each other , and ... And a first date is quite a milestone- - - Okay . - In a young woman 's life . Please . Dr. Rosen , I 'm not gonna talk about this . Not with Nina , and certainly not with you . All right , if you change your mind ... - Thank you . - I 'm here . I will let you know . How would you like to go on a little road trip ? - To where ? - Fenton , Pennsylvania . Agent Sullivan called about a situation there and I think your abilities might come in handy . According to Sullivan , Fenton 's been hit by a rash of deaths . Three so far . The victims suffered rapid onset organ failure . The CDC found abnormalities in the victim 's brains , but no pathogens that could 've caused them . Of course , the CDC doesn 't know about Alphas . Now it 's our turn . [ Sighs ] I would 've have guessed we 'd need to employ our new cover so quickly . I don 't know . I think I liked it better when we were seeking out math experts and violin prodigies . I know , it 's a bit of an adjustment . Adjustment ? Well , our mandate is changing , Rachel . You know the saying , the reward for success is ... Well , we shouldn 't get ahead of ourselves . You know , we don 't even know if we 're dealing with an Alpha yet . And that 's why I need my best forensic investigator . [ Whooshing ] I smell fear . Whatever 's happening here ... This whole town is scared to death . Yeah . He said it 's right up here . It 's radiation from that nuclear plant upriver . I read an article about electromagnetic fields caused by power lines . Cancer clusters . - Terrified . - Hm ? - Just like the others . - Seem to have a bit of a chicken or the egg thing going here . Dr. Rosen ? Yes . - Yes , Miss Pirzad ? - Pirzad , yes . - I 'm Dr. Calder , CDC . - I was under the impression that the CDC had already ruled on this case . Yeah , we 're just pulling up stakes as we speak . But when I heard they were sending in the DCIS , I thought that I might do the hand-off myself . Oh , that 's very considerate of you . Now I 've read your reports , are there any further developments ? With all three victims , the damage was centered in their amygdalas . - The ... ? - The structures in the brain that process fear and stress . It 's as if they were subjected to a sudden and really severe shock . Are these people afraid because their neighbors are dying or is it the fear that 's killing them ? It 's the chicken or egg , hm ? Good luck . Three people are dead . We need answers ! How is my team supposed to focus when all they can think about is who 's gonna drop next ? You 've gotta calm down . I 've told you everything I know . You haven 't told me a damn thing ! Look , I swear , Marty , if you are holding out on me- - Don 't threaten me . That was a lot of testosterone . Sheriff Handell ? Hi , I 'm Dr. Lee Rosen ... Rachel Pirzad . Marty . Sorry about that . Coach Zelanski gets a little passionate about his football team . " Passionate ? " I heard they were sending more people , so exactly who are you folks ? - Oh , sorry . - DCIS . Come on back . How 'd this end up at Defense Department ? Are we looking at terrorism ? I wouldn 't jump to any conclusions just yet . Sheriff , I 'm sorry , were there any links between the victims ? Ned Burton died first . He was David Burton 's dad . Oh , David is the local football star . Ned was a realtor . Watts was our bank manager . James Howard a guidance counselor at Fenton high . These bodies looked half melted inside . But there was no infection , nothing on tox screens ... Tell me what I 'm missing . I mean , four deaths in four weeks is way outta my league . Did you say four deaths ? We were only informed about three . Yeah , the fourth was unrelated . Just a freak accident . What kind of freak accident ? Car crash . Chris Elkhart slammed into a telephone pole on his way home from school . It was a horrible tragedy . Autopsy ? In a small town like this when a kid hits a pole , it 's probably drugs or alcohol . But why put the family through that ? Besides , this had nothing to do with the other deaths . We probably have to see the body in order to be certain . I assume we 'll need a court order to exhume ? Chris ' mother 's been through hell . I promise we 'll be as considerate as possible . Exhume Chris ? Uh , I don 't understand . I 'm a father , Mrs. Elkhart . But I can only begin to imagine your pain . But ... Given the circumstances of Chris ' accident , we 've asked Sheriff Handell to help us look into things a little further . Isn 't that right , Rachel ? I 'm sorry , Mrs. Elkhart . How long was it just the two of you ? Chris was 12 when his father passed . Cancer . Mm . That must 've been a difficult time . Chris helped me get through it . I know most teenagers don 't wanna hang out with their mother , but ... Chris always told me that I was his best friend . He always called us " The dynamic duo . " I 'm sorry I have to ask this . But around the time of the accident , was there anything out of the ordinary happening in Chris ' life ? Was he exhibiting any odd behavior ? Chris tried out for the football team this year . It 's a religion around here . But he wasn 't big enough , so Coach Zelanski made him equipment manager . We ran into the coach earlier . He was very , uh , passionate . He 's a thug . He used to get on Chris for everything . He would shout at him to move faster , do it better . I told him to quit , but he didn 't want to let the team down . They all showed up for his funeral , though . Players and coaches . That must 've been very comforting . Chris would 've liked it . He was finally one of them . [ Crying ] I 'm--I am so sorry . This is so unprofessional . Chris ... Chris was so lucky to have such a loving mother like you . Aw , that is so sweet of you to say . Eh ... [ Sniffs ] All right , um ... If you think exhuming his body would help . But could we please get this over quickly ? Rachel , are you all right with this ? I need you to be honest with me ... I know I lost it in there , Dr. Rosen . I will not let that happen again . But it will . And that 's okay . You know , I 'm glad we have this chance to talk . Because you 've been feeling pretty sensitive since you 've moved out of your parents ' home , haven 't you ? My mom won 't even return my calls , Dr. Rosen . And I miss her . So seeing what a loving relationship Mrs. Elkhart had with her son has probably made you feel- - It hurt . Look , I just- - I just wanna find out whoever did this to her , okay ? Whoever took her child away from her . Mm-hmm . That coach seems like a real nightmare . Fear and stress , right , Dr. Rosen ? Yes , well , we need to find out everything we can before we confront anybody . Of course . But , yes , that sheriff was not a very big fan of Coach Zelanski 's . Sheriff ? Eh , this is odd . Is anybody here ? [ Rings bell ] I smell decay . [ Buzzing ] One heartbeat . Back there . Rachel . [ Light buzzing ] Sheriff Handell ? Sheriff Handell ? [ Sniffs ] The smell , it 's everywhere . [ Squishes ] Rachel , wait . Agh ! Dr. Rosen ! Help ! Agh ! Ugh ! - [ Vomits ] - Agh ! Agh ! Are you all right ? I don 't know ! Sheriff ? Can you hear me ? I should 've listened . Who did this to you ? Should 've stopped it . [ Sharp inhalation ] [ Exhales ] Please , just call me back . Is Rachel joining us ? I told her her food was getting cold , but ... Well , if she feels anything like I do , I imagine she 's quite rattled . I 'm just gonna have to take one for the team . Would you like to pay , Bill ? Eggs , cheese , bacon , pancakes ... You sure these folks didn 't just die of heart failure ? Heart failure . Because of the food . Maybe they were just bored to death . Hey , I grew up in a town like this . Of course you did . Explains your name , Hicks . What were you ? The star quarterback ? No , star pitcher , right ? What can I say , I peaked early . Well , I can say with confidence that none of these people died from boredom or poor diet . Cortisol levels in Sheriff Handell 's blood were five times higher than I 've ever seen . Mm , cortisol . Makes sense . Come on , what 's cortisol , Doc ? It 's a hormone produced when the body undergoes stress . At chronically elevated levels , it can shrink the amygdalas and even eat away at muscles and organs . Now imagine that on a radically amplified scale . Can I get you anything else ? DCIS , you don 't ask questions , we ask questions . - Gary . - We ask and you tell . Gary , that 's impolite . So you really are Feds . - Put it away . - I knew it . It 's a serial killer , isn 't it ? You tell us . Respect the badge . - Gary . - Gary . - Bill is laughing . - What else could it be ? I mean , I know they didn 't find poison , but there is untraceable poisons , right ? Or maybe it 's something in the water ? Ma 'am , I promise you , we 're looking into anything and everything related to these--to these victims . And when we find out what caused this , we 'll let everyone know . Okay . All right . Meet Coach Kent Zelanski . Grease . Thank you , Gary . So he 's connected to four of our victims . The guidance counselor , the football player 's father , and Chris Elkhart . And Rachel and I saw him in conflict with the sheriff . Mm . I don 't know what our next step should be . Murder investigations aren 't exactly the cornerstone of my practice . Well , I 'm sure you don 't think I just came here for the vacation , right ? I got you . Thank you , Bill . [ School bell rings ] So Nina and I will start with Coach Zelanski I want the rest of you to canvas the school be very , very careful . We don 't know how this Alpha is killing folks . If there is an Alpha . Yeah , well , we still wanna be on alert , people . " Can 't believe we still have cheer practice when people are dying . " " Ms. Rue was all up in my grill over that trig test . " Up in my grill ... Try to concentrate the ones from Coach Zelanski , okay ? Yeah . Whoo ! My jacket doesn 't have leather sleeves . I want a patch on my jacket . A " G. " - Okay , I 'm gonna get you a " G. " - For Gary . For Gary . I 'm gonna sew it on myself . You just focus for a couple minutes , okay ? Okay . Hey , Cameron , you 're up in my grill now . You gotta get out of my grill . Okay . Coach Zelanski sends mean emails . There 's one to rich Wallace . And there 's three- - no , there 's four to David Burton . David Burton . Burton . Isn 't that the name of one of our dead guys ? DCIS , eyes to yourself . What does my relationship with Ned Burton have to do with his death ? Like I said , we 're just trying to get a better sense of the victims . You think I don 't see where this is going ? All right , you tell me . Where 's this going ? You know , you better be pretty sure of yourself before you come into my school and accuse me of being a part of- - - Listen , listen . Nobody is accusing you of anything ... Yet . Do you know what I do for this town ? In case you haven 't noticed , Panthers football is Fenton . My team gives people hope . And you come in here insinuating I had something to do with these deaths ? I never insinuated anything . You are a damn liar . You are- - Just stop it . You need to sit down , lose the attitude , and answer our questions . Right . Right . I 'll answer your questions . What do you wanna know ? I 'd like to see these fancy badges do that . Coach Zelanski is an ass . But he 's definitely not our Alpha . And you 're certain about that ? I could be wrong . Maybe it is the water . Oh , CDC 's been very clear about that . So assuming it is an Alpha . Someone who 's using fear and intimidation to kill these people , have you come across anyone who fits that , you know , that profile ? There was one football player that kept popping up in Handell 's files for fighting and vandalism . But also bullying . He even bullied- - Hold on , hold on . Where 's Gary ? David Burton . No one likes David Burton . Not the coach , not anyone . " He punched you . " " Yep . " " Did you see Burton freak 'n out ? " Freak 'n . F-r-e-a-k-n . That 's not a word . " Guy 's a psycho . " " Doosh ! " Doo--doosh . Get out of my hallway , wuss . Oh , hey ! You 're Dave Burton . The killer scares people . You scare people . Killer ? Since when are they letting retards into the school ? I 'm not- - I 'm not a re- - hey , you shouldn 't use that word . I 'm autistic . You 're a retard . You look pretty retarded to me . 32 on the car scale . You have bad breath . Yeah , Carly Wellin , she said that she 'd rather lick a toilet seat than kiss you . It got 47 retweets . Hey ! Don 't touch me ! I don 't like to be touched ! Yeah ? Well that 's really too bad for you , man . Hey , hey ! Back off ! [ Loud metal bang ] Agh ! [ Whooshes ] [ Grunts ] Agh . [ Whooshes ] Hey , leave my players alone . That 's David Burton , the Alpha ! Stop him ! Let me borrow this . [ Grunts ] FBI , out the way , out the way . Excuse me . Out the way . [ Gasping for breath ] Oh , jeez . Doc . [ Gasping ] Was just trying to trip the kid , not kill him . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to . [ Gasps ] Cameron , you did not do this . He is not an Alpha . He 's another victim . But how ? Where 's the Alpha who did it ? There 's a hospital about 15 miles from here . Kathy , I need you to secure an MRI suite . Based on the other victims , I 'd say David was attacked a few hours ago . His jacket 's getting caught on the door . It 's too bulky , you should take it off . - Gary ... - Let me wear it . Gary , back up . You wanna pick the seat up ? Gary , you 're gonna get hurt . - The lever right there . - It 's stuck . I think our being here has accelerated the killer 's time tables . I would appreciate some help . - Now . - Thanks , we 're on our way . Bill , Cameron , I think you should stay here and keep looking . It might be a good idea to retrace David 's last few hours . Dr. Rosen , I 'd like to stay too . Okay . - Gary , get in . - No , I have bruises in my hair . So David 's mother 's saying he left at the same time as usual . Walked through the neighborhood . No one at school saw anything strange up until the fight . - We 're coming up empty . - Not so fast , kids . The exhumation on Chris Elkhart is done . We got the whole deal . The autopsy here , we got the county medical records the accident reports , the school files I requested . Now Rachel , you said that in all the victims , the am- amygdalas . - Thank you , Dr. House . They shrunk in all the vics , right ? - Yeah . - Well , that 's not the case with Chris Elkhart . So it was just an accident . I don 't know . Accident report 's not adding up . Hicks , that temporal spatial whatever thing you do ... That can come in handy . I need you to come with me . It 's nice to feel wanted . You know what , you guys go ahead . I 'm gonna talk to the mom . Gary , take that off . It 's not yours . No , it looks better on me . I 'm a baller . How do you even know that word ? - It 's the right word . - Nina , Nina . Same symptoms as all the other victims . Cortisol levels through the roof . And when we flushed his system , his body continued to produce cortisol as rapidly as we could get rid of it . Well , maybe David is pushed and it just keeps triggering him . Yeah , maybe Nina 's the killer . [ Chuckles ] Are you the killer , Nina ? It would be a surprise . [ Chuckles ] Because for the levels to remain so high for so long , they would have to be triggered continuously . These readings are consistent with a dr- - a drug addict . That 's why his body is producing so much cortisol . He 's in withdrawal . Withdrawal . But what 's he addicted to ? There were no foreign substances indicated in his blood . I think he 's addicted to a person . They all were . The patterns were all the same . Addiction , then withdrawal . Fatal withdrawal . He 's not responsive to meds . Just like all the others . I really feel we need to quarantine this kid . It won 't be necessary . Whatever is making him sick is not contagious . Dr. Calder , hello again . I asked the hospital if they would call me if anyone else fell ill . May I ? We need to initiate support therapy right away . Start a dilauded drip . [ Gasping slows to normal breaths ] What did you just do to him ? I just took his hand . It seemed as though he needed some contact . Let go . Just for a moment . [ Gasps , groans ] Okay . Take hold again . But both hands . I don 't get it . Why is this helping ? By holding his hand , Nina . She 's giving him exactly what he needs . It 's a chemical secreted by his own brain , oxytocin . It 's often called " The love hormone . " It 's critically important in bonding people to the ones they love . And conversely , it causes the very real pain people speak of when separated . That 's where the cortisol comes in . Yes , we need oxytocin right away . You got it . There 's something I think I can add to that . Will you help me ? Nina , someone in David 's life has done this to him . A serial killer who formed an unnaturally strong bond and then severed that bond . Our Alpha . [ EKG alarm beeps ] He 's flatlining . Nina , hold tightly . Crashing here ! Based on the medical evidence , it doesn 't look like Chris was a murder victim . But my colleagues are still looking into it , and we should have answers for you very soon . But you had a suspect ? - David Burton . - [ Sighs ] I read David 's file . I know that he bullied Chris , but now he 's dying . Well , you 'll excuse me if I don 't shed any tears . Not after what David and his friends did to my son . What exactly did they do ? Jessica , we need to know everything . They thought he was weak because he couldn 't make the team . He didn 't like the same music they liked , stupid things . So they ridiculed him , spread rumors about him on the Internet , beat him up . The worst part for Chris was that he idolized those boys . He couldn 't understand why they had targeted him . I 'm sorry for dumping all this on you . You were very kind to come here . When did you say your friends were coming back ? Oh , well , they 're at the accident scene . So half hour , maybe 45 minutes . Oh . You could wait here . I could make you a snack- - sorry . - No , it 's okay . It 's a habit . It 's just a habit . I guess in some ways you remind me of him . You 're so sweet . I won 't keep you . No , it 's okay . I 'd love to stay . - Really ? - Yeah , snack sounds good . This is the spot , huh ? You know , I am fully literate in accident reports , Hicks ? Did you know that ? Was it raining ? An oil slick or something ? No , it was a clear day . Overcast , so no sun in his eyes . Like today . - How fast was he going ? - Report said 65 . But he had good brakes and new tires , so . Plenty of room to maneuver . I 'd expect to see swerve marks if it was an accident . [ Loud crash ] What you got ? This is no accident . Oxytocin seems to be working . Your instincts may very well have saved David 's life . I still don 't understand the addiction to the oxytocin . I mean , does your team have any idea what 's causing it ? Um , yes , we do . Okay . Just the glaring silence of government work . Something you seem to be familiar with . It 's been a pleasure . Thank You . Need ... To see ... Need to see her . Tell her ... I 'm sorry . I did--I didn 't mean to hurt ... Who do you need to see , David ? [ Mumbles ] Who didn 't you mean to hurt ? All right . Just let me know if anything changes , please . Sure . [ Phone ringing ] Yes , Bill . Doc , I think we have our Alpha . Who ? How ? According to Hicks , Chris Elkhart did not die in an accident . Look , he crashed on purpose , Doc . The kid floored it and drove right into a- - I got this , okay ? This is what I do . - Put it on speaker . - We matched the autopsy with the police report and the facts are not matching the conclusions . I mean , this kid died of a suicide . And why wasn 't that in the reports ? No idea . Handell covered it up . He covered up a lot of things . Like that football kid , David Burton . Apparently , he 'd been bullying Chris something awful . And according to Chris ' file , his mother raised holy hell about it to that guidance counselor , Dave 's dad , and that team booster , Marvin Watts . Yeah , and Sheriff Handell . No one did anything about it . So there 's your motive and opportunity . Well , a grieving mother . An entire town to blame . Yep . - Rachel . - What ? Rachel just went to that woman 's house . Oh , my God . Come on ! Is that nutmeg and cayenne ? Hm . I 'm impressed . I only use a pinch of cayenne for the whole batch . That was Chris ' favorite . You really loved him , didn 't you ? He was my son . My parents , um ... Think I 'm a freak . Oh , I can 't believe that . The cayenne , that was nothing . I can taste every ingredient . This blanket- - Alpaca and silk . Plus 5 % performance fleece . I can tell you that just by touching it . All my senses are that strong . That 's amazing . Have you always been like that ? You should hear what my parents say . I hear them . They think I 'm sick because I can 't stand the sight of germs , because sometimes I won 't eat . They pray that they can find someone- - anyone to marry me . But I can 't even handle a kiss . Who 's gonna wanna marry someone like that ? The only thing I 'm good for is being a walking crime lab . Have you told your mother how you feel ? She won 't talk to me about it . [ Phone ringing ] In fact , she won 't talk to me about anything right now . [ Ringing continues ] [ Crying ] That 's ... That 's Agent Harken . He probably knows something about Chris . I should get that . Rachel ... It can wait . I 'm here for you . - [ Cries ] - Oh . Oh , angel . Oh , there , there . There . How do you feel ? I feel wonderful . [ Whispers ] No , no , wait , wait . [ Whispers ] What ? [ Whispers ] Small town . Whatever . - Anything ? - No , all clear . I 'll try Rachel . [ Phone ringing ] Rachel . I am so glad that I can finally talk to someone . I don 't know why but I feel like I can trust you with anything . You can . I wanna trust Dr. Rosen . I do , but ... Sometimes I think all he cares about is my Alpha ability . So all of your team members are Alphas like you ? Yeah . Everybody , except for Dr. Rosen . Where are we going ? Well , we have to make one stop . And then I 'll need your help to get away . Away ? Away from what ? Nina , has Gary pinged Mrs. Elkhart 's cell phone yet ? [ Typing ] Sir , you can 't touch that . - Hey , that 's illegal . - DCIS . A little room , please . - Any luck , Gar ? - No , I 've got signal overload . The Doppler Radar truck 's in the neighborhood . I hate Doppler 2,000 . And 3,000 , 4,000 ... - Okay , you heard that ? - If I think back , Rachel was drawn to that woman immediately . [ Sighs ] She could die . Well , from what you said , this Jessica has no reason to hurt Rachel . Well , I don 't think Mrs. Elkhart 's fully rational . The oxytocin bond works both ways . And I think Chris ' death triggered something akin to psychotic postpartum depression . And Rachel 's incredibly vulnerable just now . Not just emotionally , but physically because of her abilities . Okay , I found her . The Doppler 's gone . They 're moving east on Crosscreek Road . Hicks and Harken are close . Get Harken and Hicks . Put them on . Put me on . You killed those people . Why ? How ? When Chris was born ... I felt this overwhelming rush of love . And from that point on , I could make other people feel that way too . I don 't see how that could hurt anybody . Neither did I , until Chris ' funeral . David 's father came to me crying about what his son had done . And I comforted him . Then he told me he knew about the bullying and did nothing . I told him I never wanted to see his face again . The next day ... He was dead . That 's when I knew how I could make things right for Chris . You 're talking about murder . I 'm talking about justice . Jessica , please , stop this . You 're a good person- - - No , I begged them to stop David and his friends . I begged them . And they blamed Chris . They blamed him and said that he was too sensitive . That I should--I should take him to a therapist , and I should toughen him up . Dr. Rosen can help you . - I don 't need his help ! - It hurts . I 'm sorry , Rachel . But you 're supposed to be helping me . If you help me ... You 'll feel better . Okay , yeah . They 're heading east . Just head east . Okay , now wait , go right . - Are you su- - - Yeah , go right , now . [ Tires screeching ] - Through the woods ? - You should 've let me drive . You know what , it 's my car . Okay , you can cut them off at the next intersection . Floor it . [ Car revs ] Boondocks . Hello ? [ Thud ] Damnit , Gary . I broke my axle . I told you , you should 've let me drive . That 's not my fault . You can drive safe and fast . Hands at ten and two . Gary , whatever . So now what ? I don 't know about you ... But I 'm gonna run . What is it ? What do you see that I can 't ? Rachel . [ Sharp inhale ] It 's Bill . And the others can 't be far behind . Okay , Rachel . Come on . - What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . What 's going on ? - I 'm sorry . - Why ? I 'm sorry , but I 've run out of time . What ? [ Slaps ] - I don 't love you . - Agh ! I want you to die . Agh . Rachel . Rachel , Rachel . Rachel . Oh , Jessica . Thank goodness . I am so glad that you called . With the Feds taking David and all those people dying , I just feel like I am losing it . But if we can talk , I know I 'll feel so much better . It always helps so much . I won 't be here long . Why not ? You murdered my son , Kent . You and the rest of them . No . And now , I want you to spend your last few hours dying alone . Doc , she 's not responding . What do I do ? Hold her still , Bill . - Rachel . - What is that ? It 's oxytocin . Something to counteract the withdrawal . This doesn 't look like withdrawal , Doc . I mean , it 's happening too fast . For anyone else , but not for Rachel . She 's not anyone else . Come on , girl . Oh , God , it 's not working . It 's not breaking the pain cycle . Maybe she can . Rachel , Rachel , listen to me . Focus on my voice . Hold her . Hold her tight . Focus on the feeling of our hands . Just that feeling . Block everything else out . Feel the comfort . I need her . Her love is not real . Real love is unconditional , Rachel . Listen to me . I care about you more than you will ever know . You 're like a daughter to me . You always have been and you always will be . Concentrate . Concentrate . We love you , Rachel . We love you , Rachel , all of us . - Rachel . - Listen to the Doc , Rachel . You okay ? Come on . You can do it . Focus on the feeling of our hands . It 's working . You 're doing it . She 's doing it . You 're doing it . You 're doing it . - Okay , pull her up . - Yeah , come here . - Dr. Rosen . - Yes , yes . We 're right here . We 're all here . You 're good ? [ Crying ] Good girl . Oh , good girl . [ Dog barking distantly ] Don 't do this , okay . I love you . I would do anything to bring Chris back , anything ! A little late for that . I know things got out-of-hand , okay ? I admit that . But if Chris wanted to play ball , he needed to be a whole lot tougher than he was . Nobody thought he would drive into a telephone pole , nobody . Always comes back to that , doesn 't it ? It always comes back to " It 's always Chris ' fault , " " It 's Chris ' problem . " I am--I am so sick of hearing that . What do you want me to do , Jessica ? Just tell me and I will do it . I swear I will do it . Burn in hell . [ Grunt ] Hold it right there . Right there , don 't move . Don 't let her touch you . We 're gonna need an ambulance at 57 Poplar Way . Where are you going ? Don 't let him- - don 't help him . He let my son die . I 'm sorry to hear that . But killing someone else is not gonna help you , is it ? Jessica , stop . Chris wouldn 't have wanted you to hurt anyone . Not for him .

 I saw a girl kill herself . - Ew ! - Yeah , and she looked exactly like me . We 're clones . We 're like lab rats in an illegal experiment . If it were my experiment , I would put an observer close to the subject To keep tabs and accumulate data . - Where is beth ? - She killed herself . I took her identity . You 're her monitor , aren 't you ? Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep . I know exactly who you are . You 're a ... A sleazy watcher spy !

We have leverage . You still work for leekie . On your behalf , to protect you . These samples aren 't gonna go to dyad , And you can 't tell them that we know about the patent either . I 'd do my own research first . This is my biology , it 's my decision . Ok ? Ok . You 're right . ( knocking on door ) ( knocking on door ) What the dickens ? Rachel took kira ? She can 't do that . We agreed to a code of conduct . Yeah , well , sarah didn 't sign a deal , did she ? Shh , shh . Sorry . I was supposed to ask you something , but I just ... Oh , can we borrow a gun ? Oh , right , you need a gun . Apparently , I 'm the go-to girl for guns , right ? Ok , alison , come here . We ... Holy shit . What is with the balls of your thumbs ? They 're so bouncy .

Yeah , you got about 30 seconds . Ok , well , now that nobody 's listening , where exactly are they ? All they gave me is a message from rachel . Tomorrow morning , she 's getting on a private plane , with kira . You could be on that plane with them or not . What ? She 's just a child , paul . How can they use her as leverage ? Sarah , I can 't tell you what to do , but Tonight there 's a big event at the dyad . Rachel will be there . Ok , what else ? She 's , uh , insulated . Daniel rarely leaves her side . But now he 's tasked with bringing you back . He 's coming after you . She says , " up yours . " Hey , can I borrow your phone ? Can I touch your boob ? Cheeky . ( phone beep ) It 's like a glitzy corporate event , sarah . I don 't see what good a gun is gonna do . She 's planning on gate-crashing . I don 't have a plan yet . Cosima , where 's delphine ? At the dyad , getting ready . She wants me to go to this thing . Maybe I should . I smell lesbians in my bed last night . Look , I 'm not gonna apologize for my heart , ok ? But I promise both of you guys that I 'm not gonna get fooled again . Why don 't I talk to them , sarah ? No , no , no , no . Just sit tight , ok ? I 'll feel better when I have a gun . This is totally crazy . Oh . - Morning , mrs . Hendrix . - Hello , ramon . Did I catch you on a break ? Oh , customer service never takes a break at econo-mart . So , uh ... Avomax ? Zaraphen ?

Is that a lady grip ? Hot . Practical . Mmm . Thank you , ramon . So , how 's your mother ? Cosima : Hey , um , one subject is showing fresh symptoms . Do you think you could take a closer look at their profile for me ? You mean the one with some kind of synthetic sequence you refuse to explain ? Cosima : Yeah , that one . No , I can 't , because you told me to erase the data . I 'm sending you a new blood sample . Dr. Cormier . Dr. Leekie asked me to escort you upstairs as soon as you arrived . Of course . Is there something going on I should know about ? Where is cosima , delphine ? Exactly where you want her , Here in town , considering your employment offer . Be careful playing for the other team , delphine . Cosima is scared of us . She 's seen how you 've persecuted sarah . Sarah is not your subject . You 're a eugenicist , dr . Cormier . Is that a dirty word for you as a scientist ? No . I want cosima here , full time , starting tonight . So do I. 324b21 is showing the same respiratory symptoms as the other two . Congratulations . I 'm invested , which I 'm sure is what you wanted . ( people trumpeting their lips ) Ok , people , listen up . Let 's gather . Everyone , let 's gather . Circle , please . Hands . Troupe , in three days , we move to the main stage for dress rehearsal . In four days , we open . Losing aynsley is ... ( he sighs ) ... Heartbreaking . But we are not civilians , This is the theater , And we all know that the show must go on . So , Kelsey is going to be stepping out of the wings to play laura . Um , excuse me . I 'm your laura . No , ali . ( he sighs ) We all know how close you are to this . But you have rehearsed with aynsley , You know the part . We want you to play sheila . You want me to be the lead ? Yes . Give it up . ( applause ) - You can do this . - Ok . Show them , hmm ? Shine . Ok , people , let 's all shine onstage .

One , two , three , four . ¶ and we will sing , sing , sing away the hours ¶ shout till our throats are sore ¶ and we will raise our voices to the heavens ¶ god himself will hear our mighty roar ¶ and we will wipe , wipe , wipe away the plasma ¶ scrub off every stain ¶ since I cannot control my asthma ¶ I 'll stand by to entertain ( inhaling ) Yes . Brava ! Bravissima ! ( police radio chatter ) Alison hendrix is in a musical . What ? What musical ? It ain 't cats . I think she 's playing the lead . Beth 's dead , german 's dead , Sarah manning gets sprung on the cusp of confessing , And we 're left with alison hendrix , model citizen and thespian . - Yeah . - Yeah . You 're kidding me . - It 's her . - Oh , shit . We 're not supposed to be on this thing , angie . Damn it . - Hey , long time no see . - Shit . - Sarah , don 't run . - Come on . What do you want with alison hendrix ? I just told you . They killed a man right in front of me , art . Hey , I 'm talking to you . Tell me what you are to each other , to beth . We don 't know . That 's the whole point . - Yeah ? - Yeah . The diner , Sounds like the two bodies that grigson and diaz caught this morning . I know . She probably does too . Yeah , those are the people behind it . The same ones that got me out of jail . She 's making this stuff up . Then arrest me . You can 't , can you ? Huh ? - Just come on . - Come on . Let 's go check her story out . ( speaking quietly ) It 's a fortunate position you find yourself in , paul . How is that , miss duncan ? You 're the only one who seems to know what makes sarah tick . I need your office this evening . It 's the koreas . Both of them . Ah . Well , good . Congratulations . Paul , have you ever been to taiwan ? Taiwan , no . I don 't suppose you speak mandarin ? No . Hm , pity . Pack a bag . We leave Tuesday . Good luck , paul . Keeping him up close and personal ? Of course . Rachel , did you seriously kidnap sarah 's people ? The less you know about it , the better . The child may be a biological goldmine , but so is her mother . Daniel will recover sarah . - Is that really necessary ? - Yes . And not your concern . We have a big evening . You need to be on point . " to combine is to create , " to engineer , divine . " You 'll do wonderfully , aldous . Come on , just go check it out . She probably dropped those bodies herself . They have my daughter , art . Hey . So , what 's up ? Oh , best shooting we caught in two years , and the federales walked in . Check it out . - How you doin ' , ange ? - So , what happened ? George hudson , line cook . Forty-five to the sixth chakra . Cowboy was still waiting , but shotgun to the midsection . What chakra is that ? Uh , somewhere between the third and the fourth . There 's a possible eyewitness . A tea drinker . A tea drinker ? Yeah , digs out a wall , escapes out the back . Ok . Thanks , man . Sarah , if your daughter 's missing , we 'll put out an amber alert . These people are powerful . They got me out of jail . You can 't do anything . Just let me go , please . Just before the lawyer showed up , You were about to tell me everything , What this really is . You don 't want to know everything , art . You don 't want angle to know anything . Feds took over the scene from grigson and diaz . - Which feds ? - I didn 't get an acronym . Seriously ? Art : We 're off the case that doesn 't exist , angie . You want to walk her in there and hand her over , you go right ahead . Come on , you . Thank you . Angela : " thank you " ? You miss us ? You miss beth 's life , you little grifter ? Piss off . She almost trusts me , angie . No , I 'm not letting you turn yourself over to neolutionists . What am I meant to do , fee ? Hey ? If rachel 's got kira on a plane , I have to be with her . Look , look , sarah , delphine put me on the list For the dyad tonight , ok ? I can go in there and , like , demand that rachel let them go . Rachel doesn 't take demands , cosima . That 's why I needed the bloody gun . ( knocking on door ) Anybody in the house ? It 's ramon . Ramon ? Delivery from mrs . Hendrix . Well , those are so alison . It 's what inside that counts . Huh ? Am I wrong , sailor ? Whoa . Ah . Seriously , sarah ? What good is that gonna do ? Alison , you know some very strange people . Oh , they look nice . Sorry I couldn 't bring them in person . I have scads of costumes to alter . Hey , thanks for the card too . Are you making fun of me ? I made that ! No , no , no , no . It 's good to see you , alison . We love you , alison . Well , normally I 'd say don 't do anything rash , But rash seems to be a genetic trait , so Go get kira . Cosima : Believe me , Right now is the time to resist our predisposition to impulsive behavior . We need a plan . You don 't have a plan ? No , the plan 's a bit of an issue . Hey , I know where rachel is . That 's enough . Sarah , what are you gonna do ? Walk into the dyad with a gun - And just start shooting people ? - Yeah . Uh , tut-tut-tut-tut . I don 't want to know anything . Leave me out of it . ( sigh ) plausible deniability . Yeah , sure . I have to be at sara stubbs at 9 : 00 p.M. To do a fitting and run lines , so break a leg , sarah . Thanks again . This thing at the dyad , it 's , like , a big deal , yeah ? Yeah , big pharma , big agro , vips , security . That 's good , that 's good . That will be helpful . They 'll be busy . Ok , what are you on to ? ( sarah sighs ) Plausible deniability . Oh , no . No , it 's easiest just to give rachel what she wants , yeah ? Me . Just not how she 's expecting it . Ok , even if I agree with what I think you 're thinking , How do you next to rachel with daniel in the way ? ( sarah sighs ) Alison 's not gonna like it . ( phone vibrating ) Paul dierden . Paul , it 's sarah . Let me speak to her . She wants rachel . Hi , sarah . This is daniel . I speak for rachel . I 'm ready to make a deal , face to face . Well , rachel 's a very busy woman , But if you tell me where you are , I 'll bring you to her . All right . I 'll meet you at 9 : 00 p.M. I 'll be driving the red minivan . Ah ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god ! - Let go ! - Ugh ! Ugh ! ( yelling in pain ) ( whistle blown ) ( whistle blown ) Ah ! Ah ! Who in the hell are you ? This is unacceptable . I need to talk to dr . Leekie right away . That won 't be necessary , ma 'am . This is our mistake . It won 't happen again . ( amiable chatter ) Thank you . Elise ! Shite . Delphine : Cosima . - Hey . - You came . You won 't regret this . I promise . Aldous ! Look who it is . - Uh , no , no . - No , no , no , come , come , come . Mon adversaire . - ( sarah chuckles ) - I wasn 't as sure as delphine that you 'd come . Here I am . Um , doesn 't mean I 'm gonna sign your contract , though . A starting point . We 're in uncharted waters . Really , it 's all up to you . Ok . Then I want my own lab . Announcer : In a moment , dr . Leekie will be welcoming you To the dyad institute . Please stand by . That 's my cue . Cosima . You have a bright future ahead of you . This is the best place you could be right now . Thank you , dr . Leekie . ( he chuckles ) - Enjoy yourself . - Mm . You 're sarah . Yeah , nice to meet you too . Does cosima know you 're doing this ? Depends if I get caught . Now , where are kira and siobhan ? What ? Don 't play stupid . Rachel kidnapped my family . Where are they ? How would I know ? I 've never even seen rachel . I 've seen her . And if you want to keep cosima out of this , You 're gonna tell me where she is . Ok . There is serious business going on right now Behind the scenes , and so my guess is that she 's using leekie 's wing . - Where is that ? - Down there . It 's impossible to get down there . You need a specific swipe card for the 10th floor . Like this ? You 're going to get yourself killed . - Miss cormier ? - ( delphine gasps ) Announcer : Please welcome dr . Leekie . ( applause ) Thank you , everyone . I am dr . Aldous leekie , Director of the dyad institute , And it is my great pleasure to welcome you here On behalf of the entire dyad group of companies . - The keystone ... - ( beep ) ... Of the original dyad institute was set here in 1918 . ( applause ) Today , worldwide , The overwhelming majority of biotech research is funded by private capital , And today , the dyad group spans the globe . We employ 27,000 souls In 134 countries , Including vatican city . ( applause ) The age of biotechnology is upon us . It is the moral responsibility of visionaries like us To continue healing , feeding , and fueling The future of humanity . ( applause ) The recent supreme court decision ... ( man translating into korean ) ... Characterizing the legal status Of natural versus synthetic dna Was the successful result of our lobbying strategies . ( man translating into korean ) We are proceeding with the next tranche of patent claims . ( man speaking korean ) Good , you made it . I want my daughter . Of course , and we want you to be together , But my people found your foster mother 's house overturned . They were gone when we got there . - You 're lying . - I lied to get you here . But we don 't have them . Kira 's here , and I want to see her now . You 're not going to shoot me , sarah . ( gunshot ) If you don 't have her , you 're dead ! There are other forces vying for our fate , sarah . We 'll get kira back together . Nobody lays hands on me . You don 't own us . - ( gun cocking ) - sarah , put it down . - Where is kira ? - They don 't have her . They were playing me too . Now lower the gun . And what are you , her bodyguard now ? It 's you they want . It is over , sarah . Turn around . In the face ? Sorry . Go . I 'll figure out something to tell ' em . Hey , it 's me . Jesus christ . You are like a bad smell . Look , I didn 't know where else to go . Maggie chen ? What , you 're not having one ? I want it straight up . ( she sighs ) It wasn 't them , art , the dyad people . Somebody else took kira . I know . What ? The feds are calling the diner thing domestic terrorism . The cowboy that took the shotgun blast was A religious extremist , like maggie chen , A prolethean . Helena 's people . Why don 't we start with that ? Who is helena ? Are you sure you want to know what this is all about ? I guess we 'll find out . Excuse me . ( breathing with difficulty ) My sestra shot me . I need some help here ! Trauma team ! Ok , no , we need a nurse here right now . Gunshot wound . Call it in , call it in ! - Pressure ! - Gunshot through the back . Get her up . Ready ? Now . - We need to get her in ... - Move it ! Look at the camera . Shot point-blank in the chest and she walks in ? How is she even alive ? We remember aynsley 's warmth . I killed aynsley ! I watched it happen , felix . They didn 't do anything about it . The old wing is where our most sensitive research takes place . So , this is where you keep the clones . Rachel takes insult very personally . - Would you leave us , please ? - Yes , of course . Kira ? Hello ? They 're gone , young girl matching kira 's description with some guy . - I said get your hands on the car . - You 're gonna regret this . ( gasping )

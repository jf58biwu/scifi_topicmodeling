 - [ Little Girl ] There once was a witch who can spit magic out of her mouth . She would make nightmares real . The people were not happy with her so they set her on fire . She did not die . The witch hunter trapped her head in a box . She escaped and run to the woods . She goes to sleep forever . After many years , she 's awoken by a child 's curiosity . - It 's not that cool . - Really ? Mike I think it 's cool , okay ? Can you imagine what 's inside of this thing ? - A head ? - Are you kidding me ? Someone actually took the time to put this symbol on here . Look at this thing . - [ Mike ] It 's like a demon symbol . - Ow . Um . - Bandaids are in the bathroom downstairs . ( ghostly moaning ) ( yells ) ( cries ) - Dude you better not have opened up that box . ( growling sounds ) ( yells ) - There 's a price to pay for eating flesh in these woods . ( laughs ) You belong to the mordeo now .

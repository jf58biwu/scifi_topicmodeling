 Raleigh : When I was a kid , whenever I 'd feel small or lonely , I 'd look up at the stars . Wondered if there was life up there . Turns out I was looking in the wrong direction . [ Electricity crackles ] When alien life entered our world it was from deep beneath the pacific ocean . A fissure between two tectonic plates . A portal between dimensions . The breach . I was fifteen when the first kaiju made land in San Francisco . [ Kaiju roaring ] [ Radio chatter ] [ Kaiju groans ] By the time tanks , jets and missiles took it down six days and 35 Miles later , three cities were destroyed . Tens of thousands of lives were lost . [ Alarm blaring ] [ People screaming ] We mourned our dead , memorialized the attack , and moved on . [ Kaiju roars ] [ People screaming ] [ Alarm ringing ] And then , only six months later , the second attack hit manila . Female newscaster : The acid factor of the kaiju blood creates a toxic phenomenon named kaiju blue . Raleigh : And then the third one hit cabo . And then the fourth . And then we learned this was not gonna stop . This was just the beginning . [ Kaiju roars ] We needed a new weapon . The world came together , pooling its resources and throwing aside old rivalries for the sake of the greater good . To fight monsters , we created monsters of our own . The jaeger program was born . There were setbacks at first . The neural load to interface with a jaeger proved too much for a single pilot . A two-pilot system was implemented . Left-hemisphere , right-hemisphere pilot control . We started winning . Jaegers stopping kaijus everywhere . But the jaegers were only as good as their pilots . So jaeger pilots turned into rock stars . Danger turned into propaganda . Kaijus into toys . We got really good at it . Winning . [ Horns honking ] Then ... Then it all changed . [ Rapid beeping ] Gipsy danger ai : Gipsy danger , report to bay 08 , level a-42 . Kaiju . Code name : Knifehead . Category 3 . Yo , yancy , wake up ! Movement in the breach . Hey , come on ! We 're being deployed . Great . Good morning . Mornin ' . Kaiju 's a category 3 - - biggest one yet . Code name : Knifehead . [ Groans ] What time is it ? 2 : 00 . Man : Go , go , go ! Move it ! A.M. ? Yep . What do you say ? Fifth notch on the belt ? [ Knock on door ] Come on , beckets . Time for the drop . Hey , kid . Yeah ? Don 't get cocky . Raleigh : Years before , you wouldn 't have picked my brother yancy and I for heroes . No chance . Man : Good morning , sir . All right , let 's suit up and kick some ass ! Raleigh : We were never star athletes . Never at the head of the class . But we could hold our own in a fight . And it turned out we had a unique skill : We were drift compatible . [ Motors whirring ] All right . Data on helmet . Data relay gel dispersing in circuitry suit . Tendo choi : Good morning , becket boys ! Tendo , what 's happening , my man ? How 'd that date with Alison go last night , Mr. choi ? Oh , she loved me . Her boyfriend ? Not so much . You 're gonna get your ass kicked . [ Chuckles ] A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do , brother . Engage drop , Mr. choi . [ Clears throat ] Engaging drop , sir . Marshal pentecost on deck . Securing the conn pod . Gettin ' ready to drop . [ Whirring , locking ] Man : Conn pod door lock secure . Release for drop . Raleigh : Gipsy danger ready for the big drop . Here we go . Yeah ! Here we go ! Tendo choi : Coupling confirmed , sir . Engage pilot-to-pilot protocol . Engaging now . Gipsy danger ai : Pilot-to-pilot connection protocol sequence . Gipsy launch , bay 6 . [ Thunder crashes ] [ Radio chatter ] Gipsy danger ready and aligned , sir . Rangers , this is marshal stacker pentecost . Prepare for neural handshake . Starting in 15 seconds . 14 ... 13 ... 12 , 11 , 10 ... Ready to step into my head , kid ? ... 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 ... Please , after you . Age before beauty , old man . Pilot-to-pilot connection protocol sequence . ... 5 , 4 , 3 ... Neural handshake initiated . ... 2 , 1 . Raleigh : The drift . Jaeger tech . Based on darpa jet fighter neural systems . Two pilots , mind-melding through memories with the body of a giant machine . The deeper the bond ... The better you fight . Neural handshake strong and holding . Yancy : Right hemisphere is calibrating . Left hemisphere calibrating . Proofed and transmitting . Pentecost : Gentlemen , your orders are to hold the miracle mile off Anchorage . Copy ? Copy that , sir . Sir , there 's still a civilian vessel in the Gulf - - gentlemen , you 're protecting a city of 2 million people . You will not risk those lives for a boat that holds 10 . Am I clear ? Yes , sir . Man , that 's cold . You know what I 'm thinking . I 'm in your brain . I know . Then let 's go fishing . Here we go ! Come on , bro ! Put some muscle to it ! Worry about yourself , kiddo ! Raleigh : There are things you can 't fight , acts of God . You see a hurricane coming , you have to get out of the way . But when you 're in a jaeger , suddenly , you can fight the hurricane . You can win . [ Indistinct shouting ] Merritt : Get ' em tied down and go down below ! Now ! How far to the mainland ? 7 Miles off Anchorage , sir . But we won 't even make it past the shallows ! No , we won 't ! What about that island 3 Miles east ? [ Beeping ] No ! No ! It 's 2 Miles , sir . O-one mile , sir ! It 's getting closer . How the hell can it be getting closer ? [ Rapid beeping ] Kaiju . Harder starboard ! I 'm doing it as fast as I can ! Now ! [ Kaiju roaring ] Oh , God ! What the hell ? [ Indistinct shouting ] Man : Hang on ! Gipsy danger ai : Ship secure . Adjust the torque ! I 'm on it . Torque locked . [ Grunting ] Get him . Come on . Shoot him . I 'm on it ! I 'm on it ! Tendo choi : Discharge reading , sir . Plasma Cannon in the shallow shelves 7 Miles off the coastal line . Pentecost : Gipsy , what the hell is going on ? Job 's done , sir . Lit it up twice . Bagged our fifth kill . You disobeyed a direct order ! Respectfully , sir , we intercepted a kaiju and saved everyone on that boat . Get back to your post , now ! Yes , sir . Kaiju signature rising ! Man : Sensor checks . That thing 's still alive , sir . Gipsy ! We 're still getting a signature ! That kaiju is still alive ! Grab the boat and get out of there . You copy ? Grab the boat and get out of there now ! [ Kaiju roaring ] Take it , Raleigh ! I got this ! [ Screaming ] Loccent , we 're hit ! [ Rapid beeping ] Left arm 's gone cold , sir . [ Roaring ] The hull ! It went through the hull ! Raleigh , listen to me ! You need - - no ! No ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Roaring ] [ Grunting ] [ Roars ] [ Grunting ] Loading . [ Screams ] Second discharge fried all the comms , sir . I 'm not getting any signals . Man : Pressure dropping ! No pressure ! Repeat : No pressure ! No signatures , sir . What do we do now , sir ? Old man : Now , I want you to keep your eye on that gauge there . Now , you know what I 'd like to find ? I 'd like to find a whole ship . That 's what I 'd like to find . [ Beeping ] Wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Wait ! Right there , right there ! Dig ! Hey , what is it ? It 's just an old toy . We never find anything good . [ Rapid beeping ] Listen . [ Detector warbling ] Jeez ! [ Footsteps thudding ] Oh , my God . [ Groaning ] [ Electricity crackles ] Stay here ! [ System powering down ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Distantly ] Mister ? Can I help ? Yancy . Yancy . Run ! Get help , fast ! It 's gonna be all right . Taylor : The kaiju are learning our defenses . They 're adapting . Evolving . And we 're losing jaegers faster than we can build them . Lima . Seattle . Vladivostok . Category 4 kaijus are now coming through the breach . I think even you can see , marshal , this is no longer a sound strategy . The frequency of the attacks has increased . The jaegers are not the most viable line of defense anymore . I am aware . Those are my rangers that die every time a jaeger falls , which is why I 'm asking you for one last chance ... Cole : Excuse me , marshal . Excuse me ! ... one final assault with everything we 've got . Listen to me . The jaeger program is dead , marshal . On the other hand , the coastal wall program is a promising option . Taylor : The world appreciates all that you and your men have done , but it 's over . We will authorize you to take all remaining jaegers to the last battle station : Hong Kong . We 're prepared to fund you for the next eight months while the coastal wall is completed . After that , you will receive no further support . You have your answer , marshal . Tendo choi : So that 's it ? It 's over ? Herc : [ Australian accent ] Suits and ties , flashy smiles . That 's all they are , stacker . We don 't need ' em . [ Whistle blows , tools clanking ] [ Indistinct talking over p.A. ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Indistinct conversations ] Foreman : Ration cards , guys ! Come on , come on ! Let 's go ! Now , I got good news and I got bad news , fellas . Which one you wanna hear first ? Bad news ! Bad news : Three guys died yesterday working the top of the wall . [ Workers murmur ] Man : What 's the good news ? The good news is , I got three new job openings . Top of the wall . Okay , who wants to work ? Who wants to eat ? [ Claps ] Come on ! [ Man shouts indistinctly ] Woman : I am here in Sydney , where earlier today , yet another kaiju attack took place . The kaiju , an enormous category 4 , broke through the coastal wall in less than an hour . [ Kaiju roars ] The wall of life had been deemed unbreachable by its builders . Man : Why the hell are we even building ' this thing ? The creature entered the city through Sydney cove . That - - that thing went through the wall like it was nothing . Ironically , it was the recently decommissioned jaeger , striker Eureka , piloted by herc and Chuck Hansen , that finally took the beast down . [ Kaiju screeches ] [ Groans ] [ Car alarm beeping ] Chuck : [ Australian accent ] Look , they decommissioned the jaeger program because of mediocre pilots . It 's that simple . That 's striker Eureka 's tenth kill to date . It 's a new record . And you 're still going to Hong Kong , even at a time like this ? Well , orders are orders . What else am I supposed to do ? Come on , mate . Woman : Chuck Hansen , one of the pilots of striker Eureka , the jaeger that took down the kaiju . Mr. becket . Marshal . Looking sharp . Long time . Five years , four months . Can I have a word ? Man : Attention , all zone three welders . Step into my office , marshal . Took me a while to find you . Anchorage , Sheldon point , nome - - yeah , a man in my position travels with the wall , chasing shifts to make a livin ' . What do you want ? I 've spent the last six months activating everything I can get my hands on . There 's an old jaeger , a mark 3 . You may know it . It needs a pilot . I 'm guessing I wasn 't your first choice . You amy first choice . All the other mark 3 pilots are dead . [ Sighs ] Look ... I can 't have anyone else in my head again . I 'm done . I was still connected to my brother when he died . I can 't go through that again , man , I 'm sorry . Haven 't you heard , Mr. becket ? The world is coming to an end . So where would you rather die ? ! Here , or in a jaeger ? ! [ Radio chatter ] [ Shouting in Japanese ] Mr. becket , this is mako mori . One of our brightest . Also in charge of the mark 3 restoration program . She personally handpicked your copilot candidates . [ Speaking Japanese ] Hey . [ Speaking Japanese ] Pentecost : At ease . We will tour the facility first and then miss mori will show you to your jaeger , Mr. becket . Gottlieb : Wait for us , please ! Newt : Hold the door , please ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Stay back ! Kaiju specimens are extremely rare , so look but don 't touch , please . Mr. becket , this is our research team . Dr. gottlieb and Dr. geiszler . Oh , no , call me newt . Only my mother calls me doctor . [ Chuckles ] Hermann , these are human beings . Why don 't you say hello ? I have asked you not to refer to me by my first name around others . I am a doctor with over 10 years decorated experience - - [ mocking ] Oh , no , yes . I have ten- - 10 years of experience , man . I 'm very sorry . Oh , please . Who is that , yamarashi ? Oh , this little kaiju ? Yeah , you got a good eye . My brother and I took him down in 2017 . You know he was one of the biggest category 3s ever ? He was 2,500 tons of awesome . Or awful . You know , whatever you wanna call it . Yes , please excuse him . He 's a kaiju groupie . He loves - - shut up , hermann , I don 't love them , okay ? I study them . And unlike most people , I wanna see one alive and up close one day . Trust me , you don 't want to . So that 's your research division ? Things have changed . [ Light , rapid beeping ] We 're not an army anymore , Mr. becket . We 're the resistance . Welcome to the shatterdome . War clock . We reset it after every kaiju attack . Keeps everyone focused . The frequency of attacks is accelerating . How long till the next reset ? A week , if we 're lucky . [ Wheels squeak ] My experts believe there 'll be a kaiju attack even before that . This complex used to lodge 30 jaegers in five bays just like this one . Now we only have four jaegers left . I didn 't know it was this bad . It is that bad . Crimson typhoon , China . One of the greatest . Assembled in changzhou . Full titanium core , no alloys . Fifty diesel engines per muscle strand . Deadly , precise fighter . She 's piloted by the wei tang brothers . Triplets . Local lads . They 've successfully defended Hong Kong port seven times . They use the thundercloud formation . Oh , yeah . Triple-arm technique . Very effective . That tank , last of the t-90s . Cherno Alpha . First generation mark 1 . The heaviest and oldest jaeger in the service . But make no mistake , Mr. becket , it 's a brutal war machine . And those two , Sasha and aleksis kaidanovksy . Yeah , I 've heard of ' em . Perimeter patrol , siberian wall . On theiwatch it stayed unbreached for six years . Six years . [ Dog barks ] Pentecost : Herc ! Chuck ! Gentlemen , welcome to Hong Kong ! Herc : Wait here . Mako : Max ! Come here ! [ Dog barks ] Remember me ? Herc : Don 't drool all over miss mori . Hi . Sees a pretty girl and he gets all wound up . Pentecost : Raleigh , this is Hercules Hansen , an old friend from the mark 1 glory days . I know you , mate . We rode together before . We did , sir . Six years ago . My brother and I. It was a three jaeger team drop . That 's right . Manila . Sorry about your brother . Thank you , sir . Herc and his son Chuck 'll be runnin ' point using ' striker Eureka . Fastest jaeger in the world . First and last of the mark 5s . Australia decommissioned it a day before the Sydney attack . Yeah , it was lucky we were still around . Yep . Now it 's runnin ' point for us . Wait , running point on what ? You haven 't told me what I 'm doing here yet . We 're going for the breach , Mr. becket . We 're gonna strap a 2,400 pound thermonuclear warhead to striker 's back . Detonate an equivalent of 1.2 million tons of tnt , and you and two other jaegers 'll be runnin ' defense for them . Thought we were the resistance . Where 'd you get something that big ? See the Russians back there ? They can get us anything . Herc , shall we ? Good to have you back . Thank you , sir . I 'll show you to your jaeger now . Miss mori , will you give me a minute ? Marshal ! Sir , we 've hit the breach before . It doesn 't work . Nothing goes through . What 's changed ? I 've got a plan . I need you ready . That 's all . Let 's go , herc ! Chuck : Max , come here ! Woman : Crew 17 , please report to the fifth floor . Zero minus two . XY minus two . R-e-q . In the beginning , the kaiju attacks were spaced by 24 weeks . Then twelve , then six , then every two weeks . The last one in Sydney was a week . In four days , we could be seeing a kaiju every eight hours until they are coming every four minutes . Marshal , we should witness a double event within seven days . Mr. gottlieb , I 'm to drop a 2,400 pound thermonuclear bomb . I need more than a prediction . Well , uh , that 's a problem , then because see , he actually can 't give you anything more than a prediction . No kaiju entrails over my side of the room . You know the rules . Every bloody day . It 's incessant . Gents ! On point . [ Sighs ] Numbers do not lie . Politics and poetry , promises , these are lies . Numbers are as close as we get to the handwriting of God . [ Chuckling ] What ? Would you give me a moment ? There will be a double event and then , shortly thereafter , three . And then four . Pentecost : And then we 're dead . I get it . Alas . This is where the good news comes . Here is our universe , and here is theirs . And this is what we call " the throat , " the passage between the breach and us . We know that it 's atomic in nature . I predict that the increased traffic will force the breach to stabilize and remain open long enough to get the device through ... And collapse its structure . Yeah , and that 's where I gotta chime in because , really , I wouldn 't wanna go in there with that limited amount of information . Newton , don 't embarrass yourself . That 's what I was tryin ' to say . Just hear me out for a second . Give me a second , please . Why do we judge the kaiju on a category system ? [ System powers down ] It 's because each one is completely different from the next , right ? You see what I 'm saying ? One looks like a shark and one looks like a fish- - Dr. geiszler . Just get to the point . Yes . The point is I don 't think they 're all completely different after all . These are some samples I collected , all right ? Now , this one here was harvested in Sydney . And this was harvested in manila . 6 years ago . They have the same exact DNA . They 're clones . And this is the point where he goes completely crazy . There 's so much more to the kaiju than we understand . And we 've really only scratched the surface . This is a piece of a kaiju 's brain . Now , unfortunately , it 's damaged . It 's a little bit weak . But it 's still alive . Now , I think I can tap into it using the same technology that allows the two jaeger pilots to share a neural bridge . Now , think about that . I could tell you exactly how to get through the breach yourselves . You 're suggesting that we initiate a drift with a kaiju ? No , no . No , no . Not like a whole kaiju , you know , just a tiny piece of its brain . The neural surge would be too much for the human brain . I agree . I don 't agree . [ Sighs ] Gottlieb , I 'd like your data on my desk asap . Sir . No , but his is so- - thank you , newt . Guys , now , this is the most amazing thing- - Newton , I know that you 're desperate to be right so you 've not wasted your life being a kaiju groupie , but it 's not going to work . It is going to work , hermann . And I 'll tell you something else . Fortune favors the brave , dude . You heard them . They won 't give you the equipment and even if they did , you 'd kill yourself . Well , I 'd be a rock star . There she is . [ Exhales sharply ] Oh , my God . [ Exhales sharply ] Look at her . Gipsy danger . God , it 's so beautiful . She looks like new . Mako : Better than new . She has a double-core nuclear reactor . She 's one of a kind now . She always was . Tendo choi : How do you like your ride , becket boy ? Solid iron hull , no alloys . Forty engine blocks per muscle strands . Hyper-torque driver for every limb and a new fluid synapse system . Come here . Tendo . It 's good to see you , buddy . It 's good to see you too , brother . It 's just like old times . [ Both chuckle ] So what 's your story ? [ Bag unzips ] Restoring old jaegers , showing has-beens like me around . That can 't be it . You a pilot ? No . No yet . But I wanna be one , more than anything . What 's your simulator score ? 51 drops , 51 kills . Wow , that 's amazing . But you 're not one of the candidates tomorrow ? I am not . The marshal has his reasons . Yeah , he always does , doesn 't he ? But with 51 kills , I can 't imagine what they could be . I hope you approve of my choices . I 've studied your fighting techniques and strategy . Even ... Alaska . And what do you think ? I think [ Sighs ] you 're unpredictable . You have a habit of deviating from standard combat techniques . You take risks and injure yourself and your crew . I don 't think you 're the right man for this mission . Wow . Thank you for your honesty . You might be right . But one day , when you 're a pilot , you 're gonna see that in combat you make decisions . And you have to live with the consequences . That 's what I 'm trying to do . [ Door slams ] [ Door closes ] The candidates are ready . We will commence the trials immediately , sir . Good . But there is one thing . We- - mako , we have talked about this . We will not be talking about it again . Hm ? You promised me . Mako . Vengeance is like an open wound . You cannot take that level of emotion into the drift . For my family , I need- - [ indistinct conversations ] Herc : Raleigh . Come sit with us . Oh , I 'm okay , thank you . Ah , come on , there 's plenty of room at our table . I haven 't seen bread in awhile . Hong Kong . Beauty of an open port , no rationing . We 've got potatoes , peas , sweet beans , decent meat loaf . Pass the potatoes . Raleigh , this is my son , Chuck . He 's my copilot now . He 's more my copilot , right , dad ? So you 're the guy , eh ? You 're the guy who 's gonna run defense for me in that old rust bucket of yours ? That 's the plan . Good . [ Dog chomps ] So when was the last time you jockeyed , ray ? About five years ago . What have you been doin for five years ? Something pretty important , I reckon . I was in construction . Oh , wow , that 's great . I mean , that 's really useful . Uh , you know , we get into a fight , you can build our way out of it , eh , ray ? It 's Raleigh . Whatever . Look , you 're pentecost 's bright idea . My old man , he seems to like you , but it 's guys like you who brought down the jaeger program . To me , you 're dead weight . You slow me down , I 'm gonna drop you like a sack of kaiju shit . [ Clicks tongue ] I 'll see you around , Raleigh . Come , Max . [ Panting ] You can blame me for that one . I 've raised him on my own . He 's a smart kid , but I never knew whether to give him a hug or a kick in the ass . With respect , sir ... I 'm pretty sure which one he needs . [ Applause ] 4 points to zero . 4 points to 1 . [ Applause ] 4 points to 2 . Okay , what ? You don 't like ' em ? I thought you selected them personally . Excuse me ? Every time a match ends you make this little gesture , like you 're critical of their performance . It 's not their performance , it 's yours . Your gambit . You could have taken all of them two moves earlier . You think so ? I know so . Can we change this up ? How ' bout we give her a shot ? Man : Yeah ! [ Scattered applause ] No . We stick to the cadet list we have , ranger . Only candidates with drift compatibility- - which I have , marshal . Mako , this is not only about a neural connection . It 's also about a physical compatibility . What 's the matter , marshal ? Don 't think your brightest can cut it in the ring with me ? Go . Four strikes marks a win . Remember , it 's about compatibility . It 's a dialogue , not a fight . But I 'm not gonna dial down my moves . Okay . Then neither will I. 1-0 . [ Grunts loudly ] 1-1 . 2-1 . Concentrate . 2-2 . Better watch it . [ Scattered applause ] 3-2 . Mori-San . [ Both grunting ] [ Crowd groans ] Enough . [ Applause ] I 've seen what I need to see . Me too . She 's my copilot . That 's not going to work . Why not ? Because I said so , Mr. becket . I made my decision . Report to the shatterdome in two hours and find out who your copilot will be . Mako . What was all that about ? I mean , I 'm not crazy . You felt it , right ? We are drift compatible . Thank you for standing up for me . But there is nothing to talk about . That 's my room . Excuse me . I mean , come on . I thought you wanted to be a pilot . [ Door opens ] Mako , this is worth fighting for . We don 't have to just obey him . It 's not obedience , Mr. becket . It 's respect . Would you at least tell me what his problem is ? Woman : In the wake of the Sydney incident , which showed the ineffective nature of the wall of life program , many are questioning the government 's motives and wondering why the jaeger program has been discontinued . Riots have erupted along the coastlines of several pan pacific cities . Man : We have now relocated millions of civilians and supplies 300 Miles inland to the safe zones . Woman # 2 : Safe zones ? For the rich and powerful ? What about the rest of us ? Man : Yeah , answer the question . I believe the wall of life is still our best option at this time . And that 's all I 'm gonna say on the matter . Than- - thank you . Kaiju / human drift experiment , take one . The , uh - - the brain segment is the frontal lobe . Um , chances are ... The segment 's far too damaged to drift with . Unscientific aside : Hermann , if you 're listening to this , well , I 'm either alive and I 've proven what I 've just done works ... In which case , ha , I won . Or I 'm dead and I 'd like you to know that it 's all your fault . It really is , you know . You drove me to this . In which case , ha , I also won . Sort of . I 'm going in in three ... Two ... One . Hah ! [ Distorted audio ] Gottlieb : Newton . Newton ! What have you done ? Woman : Gipsy danger neural test commencing in 20 minutes . Gipsy danger neural test commencing in 20 minutes . [ Women giggle ] Gipsy danger neural test commencing in 20 minutes . [ Knock on door ] Mm . May I come in , mako ? All pilots report to mess hall . A long time ago , I made you a promise . These transmitters are non-operative . I need them replaced . Raleigh : Setting harness for test mode . Waiting for second pilot . Gipsy danger ai : Two pilots onboard . I 'm gonna take this side if you don 't mind . My left arm 's kinda shot . Sure . Are you gonna say anything ? No point . In five minutes you 're gonna be inside my head . You look good . Pilots onboard and ready to connect . Prepare for neural handshake . Initiating neural handshake . We 're not in the simulator now , mako . Remember , don 't chase the rabbit . Random access brain impulse triggers . Memories . Just let ' em flow , don 't latch on . Tune ' em out . Stay in the drift . The drift is silence . Neural interface drift initiated . [ Children laughing ] Look , Raleigh ! Over there ! Mama ! Yancy : Raleigh , listen to me ! Raleigh , listen to me ! [ Gasps ] Right hemisphere calibrated . Left hemisphere calibrated . Ready to activate the jaeger . Okay , gipsy . Lining up nicely . Better get ready . Pilot to jaeger connection complete . Gottlieb : Marshal ! Marshal ! I need to talk to you . Not now , Mr. gottlieb . I 'm sure you can appreciate how important this moment is to me . Newton created a neural bridge from garbage and drifted with a kaiju . Gottlieb : I found him prone , and he 's sort of dazed . I don 't exactly know what to do . I told you it would work . Yes , you did . Well , what 'd you see ? You know , it was only a fragment of a brain , so really all I was able to get was , like , a series of , uh , images or - - or impressions . You know ? Like when you blink your eyes over and over and over again all you really see are , like , frames . Um , it was emotional in the- - Newton , Newton . Okay , Newton . It was so- - Newton , look at me . Now I want you to take your time and be very specific . Okay . Okay . Well , I don 't feel like they 're just following some sort of animalistic urge , you know , just hunting and gathering . And I think they 're attacking us under orders . That 's impossible . Is that impossible ? It 's impossible . Because- - you know what ? Why don 't you drift with a kaiju ? ! You ! Shut up ! Yes , sir . You , keep talking . [ Breathing shakily ] These beings , these masters , they 're colonists . They overtake worlds . They just- - they just consume them and then - - then , they move on to the next . And they 've been here before in sort of a trial run . It was the dinosaurs . But the atmosphere wasn 't conducive , right ? So they waited it out . And they waited it out . And now , you know , with ozone depletion , and carbon monoxide , polluted waters - - well , we 've practically terraformed it for them . 'Cause now they 're coming back , and it 's perfect . See , the first wave , that was just the hounds . Categories 1 through 4 , it was nothing . Their sole purpose was to aim for the populated areas and take out the vermin - - us ! The second wave , that is the exterminators . And they will finish the job . And then , the new tenants will take possession . See , the reason that I found the identical DNA in the two separate kaiju organs is because they are grown ! Newton , I need you to do it again . I need more information . Wh- - ? I can 't - - I can 'tdo it again . I-I mean , not unless you have a fresh kaiju brain lying around . Do you ? [ Applause ] Pretty impressive . Yeah , he remembers how to turn it on . Oi , show some respect . When his brother died , he got the jaeger back to shore on his own . I 've known one other pilot 's been able to do that . Now , there are certain individuals whose business is the preservation and exploitation of kaiju remains . Yeah , right , black market dealers , right ? Yep . They 're in and out in a matter of hours . They neutralize the acidic factor of the blood , and they harvest what they need . Now , this guy , this is Hannibal chau . He runs the kaiju black market here in Asia . When our funding ran out , we turned to him for help , and in return , I gave him exclusive rights to all kaiju remains in the region . You did that ? Last days of war , gentlemen . Go to the corner of fong and tull . Show them that card . Look for that symbol . And a word to the wise , do not trust him . Calibration complete . Yancy : The hull ! It went through the hull ! Raleigh , listen to me ! You need- - [ screaming ] Pilot out of alignment . Both out of alignment . Both of them ? [ Alarm beeping ] Both of them . Gipsy , gipsy ! You 're out of alignment ! You are both out of alignment . I 'm okay . Just let me control it . Gipsy danger ai : Pilot two , out of alignment . Tendo choi : You 're stabilizing . But mako is way out . Mako . She 's starting to chase the rabbit ! Mako , don 't get stuck in a memory . [ Distantly ] Stay with me . Stay in the now . Don 't engage in a memory . Mako . Mako ! Listen to me . Mako ? [ Breathing deeply ] Young mako : Mama ! Mama ! [ Crying ] [ Whooshing ] [ Automatic gunfire ] [ Kaiju roars ] [ Roars ] [ Crying ] [ Kaiju roars ] [ Crying ] Mako . This is just a memory . None of this is real . [ Thudding , roaring ] [ Kaiju roars ] [ Screaming ] Gipsy danger ai : Weapons system engaged . Plasma Cannon powering up . [ Beeping ] Oh , no . Weapon system engaged ! Go to fail-safe ! Fail-safe not responding . There 's a problem with the neural blocker ! Her connection 's way too strong ! Fully charged . Mako ! Mako , listen to me . This is just a memory . None of it is real . [ Breathing rapidly ] Herc : The power line ! The power line ! Get the main power line ! [ Whimpering ] Take them offline ! Take them offline ! [ Grunts ] I just did . Weapon system disengaged . Mako ! Neural bridge exercise invalid . [ Air hisses ] It 's okay . It 's okay . Drift sequence terminated . Would you like to try again ? [ Horns honking , indistinct conversations ] [ Bicycle bell dinging ] [ Whistle blows ] Hello . [ Frog croaking ] Pss-psst . You looking for some kaiju bone powder ? S-some bone- - ? Some bone powder ? Uh , no , why would I want that ? Male potency . [ Grunts ] I take it myself . I see . Uh , no , thank you . I 'm looking for Hannibal chau . [ Door locks ] Come . Hannibal chau , huh ? Good luck . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God , this place is heaven ! That 's a lymph gland from a category 2 ! And what are you working on here ? Is this a cuticle ? In mint condition ? Is that a kaiju skin parasite ? I 've never seen them alive before ! They-they usually die as soon as the kaiju falls ! I thought you couldn 't keep them alive ! Hannibal : You can if you soak 'em in ammonia . What do you want ? I 'm looking for Hannibal chau . I was told he was here . [ Jingling ] Who wants to know ? I really can 't say . Aah ! Aah ! Stacker pentecost sent me ! [ Shing ! ] Aah ! Aah ! Oh , that 's great . That 's real great . So I take it you 're Hannibal chau , right ? You like the name ? I took it from , uh ... My favorite historical character and my second-favorite szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn . Now tell me what you want , before I gut you like a pig and feed you to the skin louse . Chuck : She can 't control her drift , and he went out of phase first ! Pentecost : We all know what happened . We can 't afford mistakes , the kaiju keep evolving , they keep kicking our asses ! He 's a has-been , she 's a rookie . I don 't want them protecting my bomb run , sir . [ Door unlocks ] You need to watch your tone , Mr. Hansen . Hey , stay there . Give me a moment . [ Door closes firmly ] You two are a goddamn disgrace . You 're gonna get us all killed , and here 's the thing , Raleigh : I want to come back from this mission 'cause I quite like my life . So why don 't you just do us all a favor and disappear ? It 's the only thing you 're good at . Stop ! Now ! Yeah , that 's right . You just hold back your little girlfriend . One of you bitches needs a leash . [ Crowd groans ] Apologize to her . Screw you . Aah ! [ Crowd groans ] Aah ! I saidapologize to her . Aah ! Herc : Hey ! Hey ! Enough ! What 's going on ? On your feet , both of you ! Becket , mori , into my office , now . No , we aren 't finished ! Hey ! Hey ! This is over ! You 're a ranger , for chrissake . Why don 't you start acting like one ? I went out of phase first . It was my mistake . No . It was my mistake . I should have never let you two in the same machine . So , what ? You 're grounding us ? Not you . Permission to be dismissed , sir . Permission granted , miss mori . Mako . Sir , what are you doing ? She is the strongest candidate by far . What other options do we have ? Huh ? Tell me ! Do not let my calm demeanor fool you , ranger ! Now is not a good moment for your insubordination ! Mako is too inexperienced to rein in her memories during combat . That 's not why you grounded her . I was in her memories . I saw everything . I don 't care what you think you saw . [ Kaiju roars , weapons firing ] [ Whimpering ] [ Gasping ] [ Thudding ] [ Air hissing ] I know what she means to you . I saw it ! I - - hey ! Hey ! This conversation is over . Marshal . Marshal , can we just talk about this for one second ? ! You rescued her . You raised her . You 're not protecting her now . You are holding her back . One : Don 't you ever touch me again . Two : Don 't you ever touch me again . Now , you have no idea who the hell I am or where I 've come from , and I 'm not about to tell you my whole life story . All I need to be to you and everybody in this dome is a fixed point . The last man standing . I do not need your sympathy or your admiration . All I need is your compliance and your fighting skills . And if I can 't get that , then you can go back to the wall that I found you crawling on . Do I make myself clear ? [ Indistinct talking over p.A. ] Yes , sir . Good . [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Conversations stop ] Raleigh : I 'm sorry . I should 've warned you . First drifts are rough . But you weren 't just tapping into my memories . You were tapping into my brother 's too . When yancy was taken , we were still connected . I felt his fear , his pain , his helplessness , and then ... He was gone . I felt it . I know . You know , you live in someone else 's head for so long the hardest part to deal with is the silence . To let someone else in , to really connect , you have to trust them . And today the drift was strong . [ Object thumps ] Her heart . When 's the last time you saw it ? Not in a long time . Gipsy danger ai : Movement in the breach . Double event . Two signatures . Dilation indicator , category 4 . [ Kaiju roars ] Excuse me . Tendo choi : The breach was exposed at 2300 hours . We have two signatures , both category 4s . Code names : Otachi and leatherback . They 'll reach Hong Kong within the hour . Evacuate the city . Shut down the Bridges . I want every single civilian in a refuge right now . Crimson typhoon , cherno Alpha , I want you to frontline the harbor . Stay on the miracle mile . Striker , I want you to stay back , look after the coastline . We cannot afford to lose you , so only engage as a final option . Both : Yes , sir ! You two . You stay put . Let 's go ! Loccent , striker 's got the ball and we 're on the roll . Loccent ... Near positions and awaiting your orders . Remain in the miracle mile . Engage at your discretion . Guys , keep your eyes open . These category 4s are the biggest we 've ever seen , both in size and weight . Aleksis : Cherno Alpha reaching target zone . Disengaging transport . Cherno Alpha in position . Miracle mile . Cherno Alpha holding the coastline . Beacon is on . [ Solemn chanting ] Hannibal : Look at ' em . They believe the kaiju are sent from heaven . That the gods are expressing their displeasure with our behavior . The silly bastards . And what do you believe ? Well ... I believe that kaiju bone powder is 500 bucks a pound . What do you want ? I need to access a kaiju brain . Completely intact . No , no , no . The skull plate is so dense that by the time you drill into it - - the brain 's rotted away . But I 'm talking about the secondary brain . Now we both know that the kaiju are so large they need two brains to move around , like a dinosaur . I want to get my hands on that . Mm . What the hell do you want a secondary brain for , anyway ? I mean , every part of the kaiju sells . Cartilage , spleen , liver . Even the crap ! One cubic meter of crap has enough phosphorous in it to fertilize a whole field ! But the brain ... Too much ammonia . So what 's the deal , little fella ? Well , that 's classified . So I couldn 't tell you . Even if I wanted to . Mm . But it is pretty cool . So I might tell you . I 'm gonna tell you . I figured out how to drift with a kaiju . Are you funnin ' me , son ? It 's fascinating how their minds work . Every single kaiju , his mind 's connected . The species has like a - - like a hive mind . [ Thunder rumbles ] Holy Jesus . You 've gone and done it , haven 't you ? I did it a little bit , yeah . You goddamn moron . [ Kaiju roars ] [ Grunting ] [ Both grunting ] [ Shouting in Russian ] Loccent ! Typhoon and Alpha are in trouble . We 're movin ' in ! You are to hold your ground . Do not engage . We need you to carry that bomb . Do you copy ? Jesus , we can 't just sit here and watch ' em die . Come on ! Ah , screw this . Loccent , we 're movin ' in now ! [ Shrieking ] Aleksis : Cherno Alpha , we 've been hit with some type of acid ! Come on ! Hull has been compromised . We need backup immediately ! Just hold on , cherno ! We 're on our way ! Our power move ! Yeah ! [ Gasping ] [ Flatline ] Tendo choi : We just lost cherno , sir . [ Rapid beeping ] [ Both grunting ] Engaging air missiles ! [ Both yell ] [ Both scream ] [ Groans ] [ System powers down ] Gottlieb : What 's going on ? What happened ? The blast . It jumbled all the jaegers ' electrical circuits . What the hell was that ? Loccent ! I 've never seen that before . Loccent ! They 're adapting . This isn 't a defense mechanism , it 's a weapon ! Get me striker ! Nothing , sir . The mark 5 's digital 's fried . It 'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary . All the jaegers , they 're digital ! Not all of them , marshal . Gipsy 's analog . Nuclear . We got two kaijus . We gotta get out . Hang on a second . Excuse me . Wh-what 's going on ? There are two goddamn kaiju headed straight for Hong Kong city . No , no , no . That 's not possible . There 's never been two before . Well , maybe that 's ' cause nobody ever drifted with one before , eh , genius ? ! When jaeger pilots drift , it 's a two-way street . A bridge , right ? Of course . Yes ! It sets up a connection . Both ways ! " A hive mentality , " you said ! Maybe those kaiju are tryin ' to find you . What - - what 're we gonna do ? I 'm gonna wait out this shitstorm in my own private kaiju bunker . But you are going to a public refuge . I tried it once . Once . Now get the hell outta here . [ Guns cocking ] [ Kaiju roaring ] [ Alarms wailing , bicycle bells ringing ] Newt : Excuse me ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Kaiju roaring ] Move ! Move ! I 'm a doctor ! I 'm a doctor ! Okay , hold on . Let me in . Okay , I 'm a doctor . Okay , let me in , I 'm a doctor . Man : Please proceed immediately to your anti-kaiju refuge . [ Kaiju roars ] There 's no emergency power . We gotta bail . I 'm gonna try somethin ' else . No ! Don 't disengage ! Aah ! My arm ! Hey ! Come on ! Get on your feet , old man ! Don 't call me that ! [ Grunts ] He 's right outside . We gotta get outta here now ! We 're not goin ' anywhere ! Now you and I are the only thing standing ' between that ugly bastard and a city of 2 million people . Now we have a choice here . We either sit and wait or we take these flare guns and do something really stupid . [ Air hisses ] [ Kaiju growling ] [ Grunts ] How 's your arm ? Ah , just give me the gun . Hey , you ! [ Kaiju growls ] [ Roars ] I think we just pissed it off ! [ Helicopter blades whirring ] All right , mako . Get ready , this is for real ! Herc : Yeah ! Come on , gipsy ! Kick his ass ! [ Roars ] [ Roars ] [ Shrieking ] Come on ! Let 's do this ! Together ! [ Kaiju shrieks ] Elbow rocket ! Now ! Aah ! Hang on , mako ! [ Roaring ] Plasma Cannon , now ! Gipsy danger ai : Plasma Cannon engaged . Empty the clip ! Empty the clip ! [ Gulls crying ] Wait . I think this guy 's dead . But let 's check for a pulse . Okay . No pulse . [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Silence ] [ Distant thudding and screaming ] [ Crashing ] [ Crowd exclaims ] He stopped right above us . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . This isn 't a refuge . This is - - this is a buffet line ! [ People screaming ] He knows I 'm here . He knows I 'm here ! He knows we 're all here ! No , you don 't understand , he 's trying to get me ! He knows I 'm here and he 's trying to get me ! What was that ? What did you say ? ! What was she saying ? ! I gotta get out of here ! Let me out of here ! I got- - ah , come on ! Those were expensive glasses . This is the worst . [ Loud thump ] [ Crowd screams ] [ Cracking ] [ Cracking stops ] [ People screaming ] [ Creaking ] [ Kaiju roars ] [ Snarls ] [ Car alarm blaring ] Torque engaged . [ Car alarm blaring , stops ] I can 't pinpoint it . It 's movin ' quick . Keep your eyes open . Choppers , do you have a visual ? Over . [ Kaiju roars ] [ Tapping ] Come on ! [ Roars ] I 'll hold it ! Vent the coolant on the left flank ! Gipsy danger ai : Coolant venting . Co2 purge . Venting coolant . [ Kaiju roars ] [ Shrieks ] Atmosphere loss in progress . Temperature 's droppin ' ! We 're losing oxygen ! Both plasma cannons are shot . We 're out of options , mako . Sword deployment . [ Screeches ] Altitude actuation off-balance . 50,000 feet to ground contact . Look , there ! Altitude loss critical . [ Alarms blaring ] 40,000 feet . Gipsy , listen to me ! Loosen all the shock absorbers , use your gyroscope as balance and ball up ! It 's your only chance ! Gipsy danger ai : 20,000 feet . Fuel purge ! Now ! Impact alert . We 're comin ' in too fast . We 're comin ' in too fast . Brace for impact , ma- - [ siren blares ] [ Radio chatter ] [ Cheers and applause ] Mako , talk to me . Mako , you okay ? [ Panting ] Yeah . You ? [ Both laugh ] Go to Dr. geiszler now ! Yes , sir ! I want the two remaining jaegers back to 100 % functionality . Yes , sir ! Hannibal : We 're gonna harvest the skin , the talons and the wing . Germans are gonna go nuts for that stuff . [ Snaps fingers ] Let me see that map . Here is where the kaiju fell , here 's where we concentrate our efforts . We 'll get it , boss . Right . Newt : Hey ! Okay , guess who 's back , you one-eyed bitch ? And you owe me a kaiju brain . [ Cheers and applause ] Herc : Raleigh ! My kid 'd never admit it ... But he 's grateful . We both are . [ Door opens ] Pentecost : Mr. becket ! Miss mori ! In all of my years fighting ... I 've never seen anything like that . Well done . Proud of you . Proud of us all . But ... As harsh as it sounds , there is no time to celebrate . We lost two crews . No time to grieve . Reset that clock . [ Crowd murmuring ] Reset the clock . [ Conversing in Chinese ] [ Parasites screeching ] I still can 't believe what you did to me . I mean , I coulda been eaten . Well , that was definitely the plan . Lucky for you , that didn 't become necessary , huh ? Okay . Thank you so much . You 're so kind . I really appreciate all of this . But now do you mind tellin ' me exactly what is taking so long for your workers to get that brain ? Well , they pump the cavity full of co2 , just like in any other laparoscopic surgery . Okay , yes , obviously , the co2 's gonna delay the acidic reaction , yes . And it allows us to harvest . But our boys need oxygen pumped into their suits . They move slow . What 's goin ' on in there , boys ? Man : We 've reached ... [ Echoing ] The upper pelvic area . [ Grunts ] Moving to the 25th vertebra . Shit . Even through the suit , boss , it smells like dead catfish in here . Boss . The secondary brain ... Is damage . Oh . It 's ruin . Destroy . Bitch ! How could they screw that up ? ! Wait . Wait . What was that ? Did he say " wait " ? Why wait ? Do you hear that ? It 's like a heartbeat . [ Rhythmic pulsing ] Oh , my God . Oh , my God , this can 't be . Hold on a second . Hey ! Let me have that ! Shh , shh ! Listen , listen ! Listen to this . [ Heart beating ] It 's pregnant . [ Heart beating ] [ Stretching ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Roaring ] [ People screaming ] [ Gasping ] [ Roars ] [ Gagging ] No , no ! Please . No ! No . [ Breathing heavily ] [ Gasps ] [ Indistinct conversations in distance ] Hannibal : I knew it . Aah ! Gone . His lungs weren 't fully formed . Umbilical cord tied around his neck . No way he could survive outside the womb for more than a minute . One look , that 's all I needed . I knew he wouldn 't make it . [ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] [ Sighs ] Ugly little bastard . Anyway , I woulda- - [ roars ] Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! [ Breathing heavily ] Huh . [ Shoe clatters ] [ Coughs ] How sick are you ? And why didn 't you tell me ? [ Sighs ] Ah . What 's to tell ? You know , them mark 1s , we scraped them bad boys together in 14 months . Last thing we were thinking about was radiation shielding . I ran nearly a dozen missions . I stayed under the medical radar for awhile but the last time I jockeyed was Tokyo . I finished the fight solo , but for three hours ... I burned . They warned me if I ever stepped foot into a jaeger again , the toll would be too much . You and I are the only two that ever ran solo combat . That 's why I brought you here . [ Device beeping , bell dinging ] What is it ? Sir , it 's happening . I just got two signatures with unprecedented dilation , 40-meter spikes . What category ? Checking the ratios , category four . Where 're they headed ? That 's the thing , they 're not heading ' anywhere . They 're hovering just above the breach . It 's - - it 's like they 're protecting it or something . All right , gipsy , striker , on deck . Sir , herc cannot ride . His arm ... You heard me . Two signatures . Two ? ! There are - - there are two kaiju signatures in the breach , not three like I predicted ? ! Hermann ! I haven 't exactly had a very good day , okay ? ! I got about 5 minutes ... Should be three kaijus . ... before brain death occurs here ! I don 't wanna spend it talking about your theories ! This is all wrong ! There should be three kaijus coming through , not two ! There should be three and there 's two ? I 'm sorry , it hurts to be wrong , doesn 't it , hermann ? I am not wrong , but there is something here that we don 't understand . Okay . Hermann , hopefully we can argue about any mistakes you made in your predictive model in the future ! But in the meantime , the neural interface is way off the charts ! If you want to help , help with that ! Newton , I am not wrong . There is only one way to make sure ... And that is to do this ... Together . I 'll go with you . That 's what the jaeger pilots do , share the neural load . You 're serious ? You - - you would do that for me ? Or you would do that with me ? Well , with worldwide destruction a certain alternative ... Do I really have a choice ? Then say it with me , my man : " We 're gonna own this bad boy ! " By jove , we are going to own this thing for sure ! [ Laughs ] Oi , tendo . Tendo ! You 're not suited up . Yeah , I 'm aware of that , Elvis . I need to know what 's going on . He said suit up , so suit up . Tendo , I can 't pilot striker on my own , now , can I ? ! Dad 's hurt , so who 's gonna be my copilot ? [ Door opens ] I don 't remember it being so tight . Getting back into that jaeger will kill you . Not gettin ' into one would kill us all . Listen , you are a brave girl . I 'm so lucky to have seen you grow . But if I 'm going to do this ... I need you to protect me . Can you do that ? Hey . Everyone , listen up ! Today ... Today ... At the edge of our hope ... At the end of our time ... We have chosen not only to believe in ourselves , but in each other . Today there 's not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone . Not today . Today we face the monsters that are at our door and bring the fight to them ! Today we are canceling the apocalypse ! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Indistinct talking over p.A. ] Go to the safety zone right now . Chuck : Hey , marshal ! You know , that was a great speech , but how exactly are you and I supposed to match up in there ? I carry nothing into the drift . No memories , no fear . No rank . And as for you ... Well , you 're easy . You 're an egotistical jerk with daddy issues . A simple puzzle I solved on day one . [ Dog barks ] But you are your father 's son ... So we 'll drift just fine . Works for me . Hey , now . When you drift with someone , you feel like there 's nothing to talk about . I just don 't want to regret all the things that I never said out loud . Don 't . [ Sighs ] You don 't need to . I know them all . I always have . [ Dog barks ] Hey . Hey , handsome . [ Dog whimpers ] Oh , I 'm gonna miss you . You look after him for me . Stacker . That 's my son you got there . My son . You know , mako , all those years I spent living ' in the past , I never really thought about the future . Until now . [ Chuckles ] I never did have very good timing . [ Radio chatter ] You ready for this ? Oh , yes , yes . Initiating neural handshake in 5 ... 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . [ Exclaims ] [ Coughing ] Are you okay ? Yes , of course . I 'm completely fine . [ Vomits ] The drift . You saw it ? Yeah . Did you ? Listen , we have to warn them . The jaegers - - the breach - - the plan - - it 's not going to work . Tendo choi : Disengaging transport . Chuck : Loccent , all ports sealed . Ready to submerge . Raleigh : All ports sealed . Ready to submerge . Man : Both neural handshakes at 100 % . Neural handshake confirmed , sir . Two actives still in circle formation in the Guam quadrant . Code names : Scunner , raiju . Both category 4 . Pentecost : Roger that . Half a mile to the ocean cliff , we jump ! It 's 3,000 meters to the breach . Half a mile ? ! I can 't even see a damn inch ahead ! How are we supposed to deliver the bomb ? Visibility 's zero . Switching to instruments now . [ Kaiju roars ] Sir ! Gipsy , you have movement on your right . Three o 'clock ! Three o 'clock ! Gipsy danger ai : 100 feet radius , clear . Right flank 's clear . I got nothing . Left now ! And movin ' fast ! Fastest kaiju on record ! I don 't see anything . It 's movin ' too fast ! Chuck : Eyes on the prize , gipsy . 600 meters from the drop . 400 meters and closing . Bogeys are stopping . Herc : Striker ! Bogeys are stopping . One o 'clock . Marshal , what are you doing ? ! They 're stopping . Why the hell are they stopping ? ! I don 't give a damn , sir ! We 're 300 meters from the jump ! Something 's not right ! Herc : Striker , the bogeys aren 't following . Take the leap now ! Newt : Don 't do it ! Don 't do it , it 's not gonna work ! Move , you fascist ! Blowing up the breach , it 's not gonna work ! What do you mean ? What 's not gonna work ? Sir , just because the breach is open does not mean you 're gonna be able to get a bomb through . Gottlieb : The breach genetically reads the kaiju like a barcode at the supermarket and then lets them pass . Okay , so you 're gonna have to fool the breach into thinking that you have the same code ! And how are we supposed to do that ? By making it think you are a kaiju . You have to lock onto the kaiju , ride it into the breach . The throat will then read the kaiju 's genetic code and let you pass . If you don 't do it , the bomb will deflect off the breach like it always has and the mission will fail . All right , now that you 've heard all that , striker , take the leap ! Sir ! I have a third signature emerging from the breach ! Third signature emerging from the breach . It 's a triple event . Oh , God , I was right . How big is it ? What category ? Category 5 . Striker , it 's a category 5 . The first ever . [ Roars ] [ Roars ] Raleigh : Striker , we see him . We 're right behind you , about 100 meters . We 're gonna come around your three o 'clock , try to flank him . Standard two-team formation . Just keep him busy for a few mi- - brace for impact ! Gipsy danger ai : Chain sword deployed . [ Both shout ] [ Kaiju roars ] Raleigh : Let 's get this son of a bitch ! [ Kaiju shrieks ] Herc : Gipsy , comin ' up on your 12 o 'clock ! Full speed ! Get out of the way ! [ Shrieks ] The release is jammed ! We can 't deliver the payload , sir ! We 're still armed . But the hull is compromised ! Half our systems are offline , sir . We need to override the- - [ roars ] Aah ! [ Grunts ] [ Grunting ] [ Roars ] Both kaijus converging on striker fast ! [ Rapid beeping ] Raleigh : Hang on , striker ! We 're comin ' to ya ! Pentecost : No ! Gipsy ! Do not come to our aid ! Do you copy ? Hang on ! Stay as far back as you can ! We can still reach you . We 're comin ' for you . No , Raleigh , listen to me . You know exactly what you have to do ! Gipsy is nuclear ! Take her to the breach ! I hear you , sir . Headin ' for the breach . Gipsy danger ai : Structural damage , 80 % . Now ... Pentecost : Mako . Listen . You can finish this . I 'll always be here for you . You can always find me in the drift . [ Breathes deeply ] We 're a walking nuclear reactor . We can destroy the breach . [ Roars ] Chuck : What can we do , sir ? We can clear a path ! For the lady ! They 're gonna detonate the payload . Well , my father always said : He said if you have the shot , you take it ! So let 's do this ! It was a pleasure , sir . [ Beeping ] Sensei . Aishitemasu . [ Beeps ] [ Metal creaking ] All systems critical . Fluid loss . Systems are critical ! Fuel is leaking ! Our right leg 's crippled ! Code red . Let 's finish this . All systems critical . What are they doing ? Finishing the mission . Loccent . We have the kaiju carcass . We 're heading for the breach . You guys better be right . 'Cause one way or another , we 're gettin ' this thing done . [ Kaiju roars ] On my count , rear jets ! Three , two , one . Now ! Hold on . [ Shrieking ] Mako 's oxygen is down . Half capacity ! Can you reroute it ? I 'm tryin ' , sir . Hold on , mako . Heat shaft purge . I 'm gonna burn this son of a bitch . [ Roars ] [ Electricity crackles ] They 're in . They 're in ! It worked . Oxygen main , left hemisphere , critical levels . Operating at 15 % capacity . 10 % capacity . 5 % capacity . He 's givin ' her his oxygen . Right hemisphere oxygen ... It 's okay now , mako . ... critical level . We did it . I can finish this alone . All I have to do is fall . Anyone can fall . Tendo choi : Raleigh , your oxygen levels are critical now . You don 't have much time . Start the core meltdown and get out of there . Do you hear me ? Get out of there now ! One pod is ejected . No detonation , sir . Loccent , if you can still hear me , I 'm initiating reactor override now . [ Rapid beeping ] Gipsy danger ai : Manual activation required . What 's goin ' on ? ! Trigger 's offline ! He has to do it by hand . He 's out of time . He has to self-destruct now . Manual activation required . No ! [ Electricity crackles ] [ Grunting ] Manual override initiated . Core meltdown in t-minus 60 . Reactor meltdown in 55 seconds . 50 seconds . [ Creatures chattering ] [ Beeping ] Evac pod engaged . 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Reactor meltdown commence . Direct hit ! The breach has collapsed ! [ Cheers and applause ] To the choppers ! To the choppers now ! Visuals on first pod . Tracking solid . Vital signs are good . Okay , where 's the second pod ? I 'm tracking it , but I 'm getting no vital signs . [ Panting ] Mako : I can 't find his pulse . I don 't think he 's breathing . Can you read his pulse ? Does he have a pulse ? Raleigh ? Raleigh ? I don 't know . Tendo choi : Mako , listen to me . It could be the sensors are not working . We can 't be sure . [ Crying ] No . No . Don 't go . Mako . No . Don 't go . Mako . [ Sobbing ] Don 't go . Please . [ Straining ] You 're squeezing me too tight . [ Coughing ] I couldn 't breathe . [ Both laugh ] [ Cheers and applause ] This is marshal Hercules Hansen . The breach is sealed . Stop the clock ! [ Cheers and applause ] [ Barking ] Tendo choi : Mako , Raleigh . We have your position . The choppers are on their way . J-just hang on .

Ah , Christine , you 're sounding as fine as ever . Hey Capra , are you still playing hacker nanny ? Give me a favor and find out how this ship got out of 202 , will you ? Alright honey , It looks like some kind of priority recommission , And how does that work ? Well , additional missions are in government of section 68 of corrections bylaws . I hate everything about this . It says here you lost a guy ? Literally , we never found the body . That 's ... Working in these tin cans it 's no surprise , look at this thing . Earth feels very far away right now . It is . Uploading Schematics . You look after yourself out there . I 'm trying , I 'm trying . ORCUS CARTAGE Unscheduled dock Activation .

It 's just for records , nobody ever watches . Name : James Mckay Offense : Food system Intrusion Severity : 1 , Work release detainee maintenance access only You 're the same security risk as Kaida , How did they figure that ? Good to go . The ship was left and locked down blast shutters and all . We 've got to leave them wide open for recommissioning . Alright , you guys know the drill , hook up a connection , clear out the network and delete any rogue programs . No power to main systems , no access to external communications or navigation . You hear me when I say this , you little pricks , I got one dead to answer for already , so no screw-ups this time . No more romantic space walks for Kaida . The guy is dead , it 's not funny . The sooner you clear this heap , the sooner we can all say farewell to little miss Kaida , - - She 's done ? - - We have another mission thrown at us out of the blue , and it 's the one that 's sending that walking bitch home ? Double check your gear , make sure you 've got everything . Sir , I 'm supposed to get a call . Must have slipped my mind ... Sorry , but it 's important . Corrections has rules about this kind of thing , right ? Would you tell me how to do my job ? No , I 'm just saying that I want my call , that 's all . Let it go . Smart girl . I 'd listen to her if I were you . But I haven 't called home since I got shipped up . Get over it and gear up . No , I 'm not working this ship until I get my call . Son of a bitch ! Did you see that Mel ? Yes sir . The little prick tried to take a swing at me . Yes sir . Self defence . Kaida , decided to join us ? Missing something ? Shit , give me that ! You must have dropped it when you were defending yourself . - - Kaida , you 're in charge . - - Sir ? What is it ? - - Not disrespect intended sir , it 's just that ... . - - Cut the crap Mel , what do you want ? We feel that given the circumstances , maybe someone else should be taking care of us . Who is we ? All of us . It 's just since Oscar 's unfortunate accident ... we are not comfortable with Kaida being at point . Is that right ? I 'm not part of this . You were not there , you do not know what you 're talking about . I 'm sure it got one guy killed . I 'm sorry Kaida , I beg you to understand . I 'm more than up for the job , Sir . Kaida ? Why asking me ? You always do what you want anyway . Well , ding-dong the bitch is dead . Mel , you 're in charge . Thank you Sir . Now get out of here and I got to go power up . Alright , let 's go . Try not to kill each other , while I 'm away . HUD 's all , Alright , this is an A class ORCUS freight liner . Looks like she 's been out of commission for a while . We are currently at level 0 , there are 6 more above us , each with their own control quarters . We are here to clear the network for reprogramming and recommissioning . Once you reach level I assign you , you need to hard wire into the ship 's system . Make a connection and use your Heads Up Display to access the network . You delete any corrupted code or rogue programs you find . - - There are 8 id 's walking through our HUD 's . - - What ? - - Someone else is on the ship ? - - No , no , that 's impossible . It 's gone . She 's just messing with us , There is only 7 id 's . Now ... I know what you 're trying to do and it 's not going to work . Alright , you and James up top , levels 5 and 6 . Come on . Hey newie , where do you think you 're going ? The elevator . Nice try , but we 've got limited power . You take the stairs . I fucking hate this job . Dispensary Closed - - I don 't like it here . - - Really ? Because I 'm loving it . I 'm very sensitive to the energy in my surroundings . And yet not to ridicule ? Shut up ! Ever since we 've arrived here , I have this weird feeling . I feel something too , but it 's more like lunch passing . There ... - - It 's a rat . - - Kill it . No , it deserves to be here just as much as we do . Get it away from me ! - - You 're such a baby . - - It 's disgusting ! No , it 's not . He 's just a smart little fellow who wants to say hi , aren 't you ? O Shit ! No , no ! O My God , you 're crazing as a pig . You 're such a bitch ! Yeah , she is , but you ... scream as one . Damn it Lara , you shouldn 't do things like that . I could not let an opportunity like that pass me by . Come on people , we have got a network to clear . Alright , this is me . Gee , don 't put yourself outer anything . I won 't . Lara you on 2 , Samson you on 3 . Di , Di , you 're heading up to 4 . Keeping me close ? Well , you 're going to need your cutters . The access panel is all welded shut . SECURITY WELDS IN PLACE Why would someone go through all that trouble ? - - To keep us out . - - Or keep us in . Processing Internal Camera Surveillance active - Tracking This place has eyes , So ? They all do . HUD 's on . Internal Camera Surveillance active - Tracking Holy crap ! This is insane . There is cameras everywhere . Overkill for a hauling freighter . - - Depends on what it 's hauling . - - We 'll disable the cameras once we have access . Well Kaida ? Are you shy ? I prefer to watch . Lara ? What do you need ? Did you get my message ? What is this thing ? Just keep your eye on it . You bastard ! HUD , check out the processes . Something is running in the network . Must be hardware . It 's got full system access . Mel , did you get that ? There shouldn 't be . Some kind of crosstalk or signalling maybe ? Capra , hold off on power . What ? - - Kaida , that 's not your call ! - - Until we know what 's running . Well , I 'm here now . I told you there was something wrong with this place . Do you want to power or not ? We should wait . The sooner we get that power the better , Capra . Sir . Yes , yes , keep your patience . Okay , here it comes . It is alive . Meet me back at the shuttle when you 're done . EMERGENCY EVACUATION ONLY Comforting ... HUD . Trace . I 'm sorry , database systems are currently updating . Please stand by . You 've been saying that for quite some time , I imagine . It won 't be more than a moment . Thank you for your patience . - - Goodbye . - - There 's a lot of rogue programs to shut down . The system is riddled with them . Sweet ! Time for some fun . - - With what ? - - The rogues . Over time some of them loose a thread . - - They don 't know they 're just programs . - - That doesn 't worry you ? No . Hear them talking , give them some hope , then erase them line by line . It is like tearing the wings of flies . We 're getting away with murder . Isn 't that right , Kaida ? Leave her alone . Kaida ! I 'm heading in , okay ? It is a pleasure working with you too . What are you doing ? Your call ... . The communications terminal . It is restricted . You 're welcome . - - Gum Gum ! You 're here ! - - Were you wicked , Nicholas ? No , I 'm not wicked . I 'm a good boy . - - I know you are , Nick Nick ! - - Are you here ? No ... Nicki , something came up . It 's work ... - - Are you in jail ? - - What ? Dad said you were bad . That you were in trouble and had put your ass in jail . You will not be with us , he said . - - Did he ? - - I am very angry with you . I 'm gonna make it up to you , okay ? I promise . He is my older brother . On screen . I can 't get into the airlock ! - - What ? So how do we get back to the shuttle ? - - Mel ! I 'm on it sir . The generator is still producing power , but it 's all being routed through some kind of background process . HUD , initiate power trace . Come on , how long ? - - I 'll get back to you in just a second . - - Can we blow the door ? - - If we all want to die ... We 'll breach the hull or the shuttle and everyone goes to hell , Come on guys , What are we missing ? I 'm into system maintenance . Overrides are waiting . Where did you learn how to write code ? I asked nicely . What kind of rogue would be able to lock us out of our own ship ? Kaida , little dragon . Identifying process . It may be a security system . How do you figure ? It 's talking to me right now . But why is he talking to you ? Open processor Window . Shit ! Tell me what I 'm looking at ? It 's bioware . Of course , the power goes to the incubation process . What is it incubating ? First human with a little tech . This thing ... is tech with a little bit of human . What are you up to ? I think I just pissed it off . Or why don 't you use one of your fancy overrides ? Why don 't you check your HUD mail : I can 't . It 's self-contained and it 's in everything . This shouldn 't be active , should it ? It 's fine , some idiot must have left it running during decommission . What was this ship hauling ? I don 't know , it doesn 't matter . - - Bioware is military-grade technology . - - So ? She is right , Yeah , well , Kaida is not in charge , I am . Mel ... Private Line . - - What is it , what ? - - We should mayday now , - - While we can , - - My first time at point and I bail ? You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? No , resume open channel . Alright everybody , we 're sticking to the plan , Clear the system , find whatever security program is causing the lockdown and kill it . Somebody tell me what is going on . Are we good ? My apologies Sir , we 're all good . Great . So I 'm stuck here waiting for you assholes to kill this thing ... before I can get back to my shuttle . - - It looks that way , yes . - - Then shut up and get it done ! Mel ... Are you sure about this ? Kaida , what do you think ? Get back to work , all of you . I 've got this under control . Kaida No ... Oscar ? What did you just say ? You saw Oscar ? No There . See ? Power is back on . Let us know if you see any more dead people , Kaida . Alright , let 's these systems cleared and get out of here . DISPENSARY OPEN Please state the nature of your pharmaceutical needs . Let 's see if that catches your attention . It 's like Christmas . Are you crazy ? Yeah , for you . But don 't worry , they can 't see what I 'm doing . The system logs everything . - - All the more reason that you should just come to see me . - - I told you we have to be discreet . You know how they can be about this sort of thing . We always use precautions , you know that . You need to be a lot more careful . Please put your arm in the designated receptacle to receive treatment . Treat me baby . You may feel pressure and some minor discomfort in this phase of the dispensary process . Why don 't you show me your tits while you are at it ? It 's locked ... - - Right now there is not much to be careful about , is there ? - - Do you think I like this ? I 'm just saying . Lara ! ? ? ! Dispensing ... Lara Damn ! Capra , Sir ? Come on ! Anybody ? Can anybody hear me ? - - That 's better . - - Shit . I shut down communications systems access . Thanks for nothing . What program id ? Any processes that which are attempting now , are just about possible . Aren 't you clever . I 'm designed to be . Too clever maybe . I don 't think so . Then why are you still running ? I 'm responsible for the people incarcerated on this vessel . incarcerated ? Does this freighter hold a prison ship ? Amphitrite is a prison ship . No prisoners . you are here . Not for long . Your attacks on my network have to stop . Prison ships were abolished decades ago . Until me then . Release the shuttle , and the communications and we will leave . I understand . We just want us all to get out of here safely . That will be difficult . How 's that ? I 'm not gonna let you leave . Then we 're not gonna get along very well . - - Comfortable , you junkie prick ? - - Stop ! Please ! What is this ? What I do . God ! It hurts . I understand that . What ? Why ? I have always done this . I do not want to die . Each one of you are made up of many tiny pieces . But I return many tiny pieces of me . I do not understand . I 'll show you . I need you to see your friends like I do . The next cycle of psychotropics can be very unsettleing . HUD on screen . Bank accounts , credit cards , let 's see what we 've got before we start clearing everything . Run . Access denied . You do not have clearance for the requested file . No ? How about now ? - - What was that ? - - I gave a pinch . Will you let me in , or what ? You are the property of Corrections . You are not allowed on this network . I guess you aren 't used to me . Stop . I have the information you seek . I know you do , but you don 't seem to wanna give it up . - - I will remain active ? - - Depends on what you have to tell me . The members of the maintenance staff have flashed bank and credit accounts ... onto an isolated data cube , When their owner 's records ... - - Were released from the system . - - Released ? Died , you mean . The ganitor cleaned them up and then cleaned them out ! How much are we talking ? 512 dormant bank and credit accounts are fully archived onto the cube . The totals will depend on interest in crude . What is it now ? I will remain active . Send them to me . - - We will work something out . - - Uploading ... One more question ... Does this hurt ? There are no closets to coward in here , you little bitch ! I will find you , just as your mother did . Environmental assessments are not available to your clearance level . It seems a shame to deal with such a pretty bloke . I 'm recording this conversation and will report it directly to security . O My God ! Squeal piggy ! Hello , Gum Gum . - - Nicholas ? - - You got your ass in jail . - - What ? - - Clean it , Clean it , clean it , clean it , clean it , What 's this ? You must clean it , - - Clean it , clean it , - - Not funny , assholes ! Good riddance ! Riddance ! - - Fucking in jail - - Turn it off ! - - Stop ! - - Fucking Fucking , fucking ... Fucking , fucking ... Bye Gum Gum Bye Gum Gum Bye Gum Gum , Bye Gum Gum , Bye Gum Gum , - - That Was you ? - - No , - - Turn it off ! - - What ? It 's not me ! - - Anyone else seeing this ? - - I don 't know . Touch me again and I 'll kill you . Okay , let go . The only way to access this feed would be communications capture . So who ? You mean what . Hey , beautiful . What happened to you ? We were locked out of communications . Yes , I noticed that . But here you are talking to me . When there is a will , there is a way . So what now ? Your body . My hands . My mouth . My lips , my tongue . Wow ! Conjugal sin . Seriously ? Sensory baths on every level . There is nothing in the rules about Virtual fraternization , I guess . It could be a nice change . Yes I thought you 'd like that . I do , but shouldn 't we be working ? Don 't make me start without you . We should do this creepy shit more often . Another sewage pipe . This beter make me stinking rich . Hi there Is it here ? Shit ! This sure would better work ! Let 's start isolating him , try to suffocate him . I can 't . Just do it ! You don 't understand . It was Nicholas . It wasn 't me who did all the hacking . Your brother ? But he 's a ... What ? A retard ? A kid . He practically speaks machine code . What did he do ? He hit bovine industries ... a city , blocks of living breathing and constantly harvested beef . It was not right . It feeds a lot of people . Nicholas got in and started decapitating . Rivers of shit , literally . He took out the whole plant . Eventually they figured out where the attack was coming from . The charges were on terrorism . But they took you instead . It was in my last year on the academy . I was good . The admiral said I would get my own ship one day . What was I supposed to do ? Nicolas wouldn 't have been able to survive a place like this . But you will . What am I supposed to do here ? Welcome to the revolutionary immersive sensory system . This is so crazy . Your partner has already initiated the session . To begin , please remove your clothing and enter the chamber . Thank you . Come on ! We 've made it this far . Others can 't see you like I can . How did you get into this HUD ? With me all things are possible . Hey , you 're the security protocol . You 're in charge ? Well , there is Capra , but yes . Capra has become unreliable . Who do you think you are ? I am , I always have been . Release the shuttle . In time ... What is the point in keeping us here ? It 's what one does with criminals . Your sentence began upon entry to this vessel . This ship was assigned to us ... You are holding us against our Will . We were just doing the work Corrections gave us in the first place . You requested this ship . No , no , this was a last minute addition , some kind of ... Presidential override . You have all been deceived . What 's this ? Look at the game she plays . Kaida . She put your crew 's lives in danger . She had Capra 's key card ... She added the work order . To get home faster ... They 'll reset her time , so she 's completely back at square one with Corrections . Surely , no reprimand could be too harsh . Meaning what ? Once order has been restored , I shall release the shuttles communications to your discretion . This isn 't my responsibility . Where the hell is Capra ? Come to daddy . Here , I found the son of a bitch . You can 't beat me . I am everyone ever confined in this floating prison . I am legions of treacherous liars , rapists and murderers . A school of hate and fear . What happened here ? Inmates breached a section of the ship , I ordered them to stand down . They refused . They died ? So many souls screaming for salvation . Begging to enter my world . The moment of death ... is the purest state of life . Flatline scan . In those last desperate moments , tags become extremely vulnerable , Our tags are protected . He can 't access information like that , can he ? It 's not impossible . They are part of me now , and I am a part of them . In the end I will crack you open , and make you play our every possible moment . What ? Shit ! Capra ! ? Capra , Sir ? Hello ? Diondra ? If that 's you dicking around , I 'll flush your pot , I swear . Mel ? I don 't understand . What is this ? Oh shit ! I 've got you now , flee bag . Who do you think you 're messing with ? Infrared ! Goodbye little , and hello . End program . But you just got here . Listen to them . It is as if they had rabid dogs in there . You 'll meet them all eventually , of course . No ! First , Let 's see what you 're made of . How could he have done that ? Time to meet the rest of your kind . No , please , no ! No ! No ! Diondra ! Diondra . We gotta get out of here . Where is she ? You check down there . Meet you back here . You have the seniority you wanted . I shouldn 't even be here . I don 't deserve any of this . As I pointed out the weaknesses in their defenses , I just wanted ... the military to understand how vulnerable their systems are . A loss . They must be helped . They needed a scapegoat . - - You had things in your custody , - - What do you mean ? There are records ... What do you think you know ? You did what you had to , Only you protected yourself . I was the first one that they picked up . I did not tell the military anything that they did not already know . Others can acquire the information . Like who ? You are surrounded by people with the necessary skills . You mean Kaida . What did she find ? Nothing . As long as she remains here . Diondra Diondra ! It 's okay , just ... Breathe ! Come on . Come on , just ... Try ... Diondra ! Capra , help us ! James ! Hey ! - - It 's Capra . He killed Diondra . - - What ? He 's out there now . This is all your fault . You hacked our work assignments . She 's the reason we 're here . She 's hacked another ship into our mission , this ship . We are here because Kaida wanted to go home early . That does not matter now . - - I think it does . - - We need to get back to the shuttle . I talked to him . Who ? I reached an agreement with the security system . It 's gonna release the shuttle to me . It 's not gonna let you go . He has no problem with us . You on the other hand ... We 're going together . All of us ! Still picking the wrong side , aren 't you ? I am . Let 's do this ! Lara . Lara ! Lara ? No . No , Lara ? Can you walk ? Mel is going for the shuttle . Not without us . Access denied We had an agreement ! The shuttle ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! Help ! We 're stuck here , Not yet , we 're not . External systems . Open remote controls . On the screen . Where is it ? There ! Can you reach it ? Got it ! If I can get it back , into another docking bay . What is happening ? I do not know . The controls aren 't responding . That 's it . He 's won . Was I worth it ? Was I worth dying for ? You bastard ! I am a fortress on a canape of stars . I can not be breached . I will stop this . Pride is the root of all sins . He gave us the devil himself . Save us the sermon . I will enjoy you if you join me . Don 't get your hopes up . Everything is hackable . Initiate vocal clearance . Do code and forget . What is that ? My mother used to say ... Do bad with a memory , do good and forget . If he wants me , it can have me . What are you doing ? My code shuts down the security processes , so we can destroy the Bioware . - - Are you uploading the tag ? - - Plus some code of my own . It 's not a flatline . But she 'll be rogue and she 'll have teeth ! There 's only one of her . This thing has demons running throughout the system . 7 control processors . The key is the Bioware ! - - If we don 't get to that , it will keep respawning . - - It only takes one of them . At least she has got a shot . That is more than what we 've got out here . Extraordinary ! I have so missed the unexpected . - - I 'm good . - - No ... you 're not . 18 % blood loss . That 's quite an injury . I 'm so sorry . You have nothing to apologize about . End process . What a fascinating construct . I can 't wait for the rest of you . One down , five to go . You don 't mess around . Have you ? Is it true ? That we were not even supposed to be here ? The ship was scheduled for clearing . I did not see any harm . You sure know how to pick ' m . I could not stand it anymore , We weren 't exactly a welcoming bunch . The others didn 't know . What 's to know ? What it felt like to kill him . Oscar . The shuttle could not pressurize with him out there . I made a decision . I didn 't have a choice . He knew that . He must have . I shouldn 't have asked . I loved his eyes , but when I cut the tether , all I remember in them is betrayal , blame , stars ... Don 't . Stars ? A " canape of stars " . O My God ! I know where it is . Schematics on screen . - - Attached to the other hulls . - - Somewhere in Engineering . Plus a power conduct would be too vulnerable . Level zero . No , no , no , you 'll just slow me down . - - I can do it . - - No , you can 't . Just stay here . He 'll block my HUD . Use the radio . I need you monitor the progress for me . It is the one shot ... If she fails ... Nothing we do out here is gonna save us . Hurry ! I don 't want to be celebrating alone . Well done little dragon . Yes You have one process ... I have many . I have been on worse odds . You think you can stop me . You can 't . People think it is a sudden cold that finishes you . Death freezes the human body instantly . That 's not how it kills you . The human body exposed to the vacuum of space is subjected to all sorts of terrible things . Ultraviolet rays burn your skin to ashes . High energy particles tear your very molecules apart . Following that ... it 's time ... Pressure ... that 's the killer . The body enlarges to almost double its normal size . The force punctures your eardrums , bursts your lungs . They say you can exhale , but ... almost no time to buy you . Do you think Oscar had time to exhale ? His skin cracked and curled in the UV-rays . He must been the stuff of nightmares . Okay Opening radio communication . James Can you hear me ? James ? James ! Yeah , I hear you . I started the EVA . What 's the status of my rogue ? This little piggy went to market . This little piggy stayed home . This little piggy had roast beef . And this little piggy had none . There 's something wrong , the rogue is in trouble . Are you alright ? Are you alright ? I 'm at the Bioware haven ... but I can 't get through its defenses unless she kills those processes . I can 't tell what 's going on . Her readings are really low . Security tities spiking all over the place . You know how this ends . There is a force field protecting the Bioware . There you are . Oh , no ! COMMUNICATIONS TERMINATED - - Kaida ! Oh , my God ! Murder ... It makes me feel so human . Let 's see what you 're made of . You owe me , bitch ! Trouble catching a breath ? Now you know how it feels . I 'm a bit of you . No . No ! It 's not fair ! Flatline scan . REBOOTING Initiate emergency call . 10 years later Sir ? She 's beautiful , isn 't she ? She 's a Class 6 , Sir . Are you ready to take her out ? Whenever you are .

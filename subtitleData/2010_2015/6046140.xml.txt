 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Chester 's mill sentences dale barbara to death . The egg- - it 's doing something . Joe : This has to be the way the dome picks a new leader . She 's your monarch . Big jim , you 're a sick bastard . Joe : The butterfly makes some kind of spot . Junior : Why is it getting dark in the middle of the day ? Big jim : My wife , pauline , before she passed , Is as good as dead if we let this fall into the wrong hands . Joe : How do we protect chester 's mill and save barbie ? Julia : We can 't . Junior : Dad , what 's happening ? Now , son , do it now ! Now , junior ! ( rumbling ) ( electrical buzzing and hissing ) ( rumbling ) ( high-pitched tone sounding ) ( rumbling ) ( panting ) : Dad ? What 's happening ? ( high-pitched tone sounds ) What 's that sound ? ( high-pitched tone sounds ) Pull the lever , son . ( panting ) Do it , junior ! Do it now ! I 'm afraid . ( high-pitched tone sounds ) ( water splashing , woman screaming ) ( gasps ) ( woman gasping and shrieking ) ( woman screams ) ( high-pitched tone sounds ) What the hell is that ? Look ! ( bell clangs ) ( wood clattering ) Look out ! Move ! ( groaning ) ( high-pitched tone sounds ) ( sighs ) Linda , what 's happening ? They 're unconscious But still breathing . Jim , let me help . What , set you free ? There are people out there , your people , that need help . Nice try , barbie . Do it , son . No , junior , junior , look out there . The sound is making people sick . We need to stop it . ( panting ) I can 't do it . What are you doing ? I think the dome 's trying to tell us something . That 's nonsense . We should go there . It could have answers for what 's happening . The dome doesn 't have answers . Yes , it does , dad . The dome is more Than you think it is . It 's shown me things . If you 're too scared to do it , I 'll do it . Look out . Stop . What are you doing , linda ? I 'm being reasonable . After what I 've seen , I think maybe junior 's right . We 'd need to take a trip to the dome Before we do something we 're all going to regret . ( grunting ) ( gasping and grunting ) ( panting ) Come on . ( rhythmic panting ) Come on . ( gasps ) what happened ? I don 't know . She was drowning in the lake . ( rhythmic breathing ) She just appeared . I have no idea where she came from . ( loud panting ) Here , let me try . ( loud breath ) ( loud breath ) ( coughing and gasping ) It 's a good thing you were here . I saw strange lights coming out of the lake . We got to get her and you dry . Can you walk ? Uh , if it 's not too far . It 's just through the woods . ( sighs ) What the hell ? ! It 's magnetic . Whoa ! ( groans , gasps ) ( grunting ) Linda : What 's happening ? Ah ... Ah , linda ... Linda : Barbie ! Oh ! My cuffs ! ( grunts ) Hold on ! I got you ! ( grunting ) Help me ! Help ! Hurry ! I can 't . Junior ! Help me ! Help ! ( both shout ) ( panting ) Okay . Come on . ( linda groans ) Linda ! Get out of here ! Barbie , I can 't . I almost got it , hold on . Linda ! Get out of the way , linda ! Almost ... Almost ... ( grunts ) Get out of the way ! Linda , run ! Run ! Go ! Linda ! No ! Sweetheart , can you tell me your name ? How did you end up in the lake ? I don 't think she can hear me . She 's in shock . Best thing for her Is rest . We don 't even know who she is . ( hisses ) Right now I 'd say you 've got problems of your own . Better let me check it out . Julia : Okay . Well ... Looks like the stitches Must 've come loose in the lake . Who sewed you up ? A ... Friend who was here . Was ? Yeah , I had to leave him . He was protecting me ; he didn 't make it . ( sighs ) Well , you can 't be sure . Not of anything , these days . ( hisses ) ( exhales ) Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? I 'd better . I was an emt for ten years . In town ? Hmm . Thought I knew everyone at the hospital . Turns out the county Likes their paramedics sober . I prefer being alone out here . Most of the time , anyway . Sam verdreaux . Julia shumway . ( barbie breathing heavily ) It should 've been me . If we hadn 't come out here , she 'd still be alive . Hey ! This isn 't junior 's fault . Whatever 's going on here , We gotta make sure nobody else gets hurt . Well , the best way to do that is finish what we started . Junior , help ! Find someone else ! You want more blood on your hands By letting that murderer go ? Barbie : Hey ! We both know that I didn 't kill dodee Or burn down that radio station . So you want to tell him why you framed me ? Is that true ? I was about to hang An innocent man ? That doesn 't matter . Linda is dead . Who knows how much of this town 's Been destroyed by this ... Magnetic pull ? We gotta make sure nobody else gets hurt . Where the hell do you think you 're going ? ( groaning ) Where you going ? To find julia . He was telling the truth , wasn 't he ? You killed dodee . She was gonna spread lies About our family that would tear This town apart . You 're the one tearing chester 's mill apart . No , I 'm the one with the guts to do what needs to be done ! Someone has to make the hard choices ! You gonna do it ? Linda just did ! Who 's next , dad ? Maybe it 's you . There you go . You know , a lot of people in town Could use someone with your skills . Hmm . I 'm not too sure They 'd be happy to see me . After all this , Whatever happened in the past ... It doesn 't matter Anymore . Some things are kind of hard to leave behind . Is that why you 're ... Holed up here ? All by yourself ? Some things you never get over . Like my sister taking her life Nine years ago . ( rumbling ) ( racks shotgun ) ( sighs ) Can I help you with something ? Look , I-I 'm sorry about your car , all right ? This is an emergency . Hey , wait . You 're him , aren 't you ? You 're that murderer . I 'm not a murderer . ( rumbling ) Besides , this town 's got bigger problems . The groans are coming more quickly . Are you timing these things ? They are getting stronger , like a ... A ... Pregnant woman 's contractions . Only instead of giving life , People could die if they don 't wake up . You sound awful confident about that . I 've been studying the dome Since it came down . I think it can manipulate electromagnetic fields And they 're interfering with some people 's brainwaves . What are you , a nuclear physicist ? Nothing so glamorous . I 'm a high school science teacher . Rebecca pine . Dale barbara . ( distant roar ) If the pulses can do this here , No telling what it 's doing to people who live by the dome . Joe mcalister . Oh , my god , my mom 's in there . Mom ... Whoa ! Whoa , watch out . She hit her head . Mom . Get down ! Oh ! Let 's get her up . Ready ? Whoa , look out ! Hurry . That door . What do we do ? Get the table . Okay . Look out . Oh . ( grunting ) watch her arm . Just get it , get it , just ... Okay . Whoa ! Whoa ! What is happening ? It 's pulling all the nails out . ( screams ) Get the nail out of my hand ! ( gasping ) ( panting ) ( metal rustling , squeaking ) ( loud rumbling ) ( whooshing , rumbling ) ( panting ) Wait a sec ... ! ( panting ) I think the dome is Pulling it through my hand . ( whooshes ) ( groans ) ( panting ) ( panting ) : Aah ! Oh , my god . Oh , my god . Here . Here . ( panting , gasping ) Barbie : Joe ! In here ! Help him . Help him . Come on , hold that . Pull it down , pull it down , norrie , help . Stove , stove ! Barbie : Two , three ! ( overlapping yelling ) ( grunting , yelling ) Watch out ! Come on , go ! Get out of here , move ! Let 's go . Go . Let 's go . ( both grunting ) Come on , come on ! ( panting ) hold-hold-hold on . Joe , go ! Ready , go . Go ! ( panting ) Right here . Right here . Right here . ( both panting , grunting ) ( panting heavily ) Woman : Big jim ... Looks like it 's just you and me now . ( panting ) ( panting ) : I 've been under A lot of stress lately ... A lot of stress ; That-that-that 's all this is , it 's just ... It 's a hallucination brought on by stress , Just ... ( groans ) What 's happening out there is your fault . Only , it 's the townspeople who are paying . I 've been carrying this whole town on my shoulders The dome is ripping chester 's mill apart ! ( deeply inhales , exhales ) ( giggles ) ( laughs ) See you , sweetheart . Go back to the twilight zone . I got work to do . ( grunts ) ( banging ) ( grunting , groaning ) Damn it . ( groans ) ( squishing ) You did this . Ugh . You . And I 'm not going anywhere . You 're not dodee . You 're not dodee- - You 're something else . Junior said the dome talked to him . Showed him things . He warned you about this . Should have listened . ( panting ) ( thumps , metal rattles ) We have to get my mom to a doctor . Why isn 't she waking up ? Rebecca : Half the town is like this . It 's the pulses . Magnetism like this can cause hallucinations , seizures , Unconsciousness ... Even death . So you 're saying , my mom 's gonna die ? As soon as the pulses subside , she should be fine . Should be ? Norrie , we are gonna figure this out . You 're sure we 're safe here ? For now . The pulses are strongest near the dome 's perimeter , So the center of town Is the zone of least destruction . Okay . All right . So we got to move everyone . To right here ... Where we are ... At the school . ( metal scrapes ) The dome 's altered the magnetic fields When all the monarch butterflies were attracted to it , But never to this extent . If the pulses keep getting stronger , They could tear apart The entire town . We need a way to negate the dome 's magnetic field . Joe , remember that experiment we did When we wrapped the copper wire around nails ? A homemade magnet . If we build a really huge one A-and connect it to a big enough power supply ... It might be able to counteract the dome 's pulses . Well , you 're gonna need a massive conductor ... Something iron or steel . And plenty of copper wire . Hey . You really think that this is gonna work , A-a giant magnet ? Well , you got something better ? The dome showed a vision to the four hands . It showed us big jim 's death . But we didn 't kill him and the dome reacted . Badly . The dome wants jim dead . And I don 't think this is gonna stop Until that happens . I hate big jim as much as you do . But taking another man 's life ... I know how much that costs . So let 's just try this The science teacher 's way first . All right , let 's go . We 're running out of time . Okay . I 'm not moving my mom . Y-you and angie can stay here and we 'll go . Okay ? Okay . I-I hope that this works . Watch out for him . ( whimpering ) ( gasping ) Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . ( shushing ) It 's all right . You were having a dream . ( shuddering ) You 're all right . ( sighs ) you 've got a nice touch . So do you . Not everyone would 've jumped into the water The way you did . Especially in your condition . You gonna tell me how you wound up Out in the middle of nowhere with a bullet wound In your shoulder ? Short answer : I was given an ultimatum . I tried to do the right thing and now I 'm not sure that I did . Is it about that guy you mentioned earlier ? We don 't have to talk about it . You can just ... Stay here . Rest . I can 't . Something awful is happening out there And it might be my fault . I have to try and fix it ; I might be the only one who can . Why you ? Can you look after the girl ? Maybe try to get her story . Hey , wait . Be safe . Thank you , sam . ¶ ¶ Hey ! ( gasps ) Are you all right ? ( bell jingles ) ( panting ) ( keys jingle ) ( bell jingles ) What are you looking for ? Uh ... A gun . We used to keep one here . ( sighs ) What for ? ( metal clinking ) ( sighs ) Your father . And you if you try to stop me . I won 't try to stop you , angie . He 's a liar ... And a murderer ; he killed dodee . You were right ; We should 've stopped him when the dome told us to . We can end this , junior . I can get you a gun from the station . I can do that much . ( swallows ) Okay . Come on . ( bangs on countertop ) What are you ? A messenger . I 'm listening . No , you 're not . You 're still thinking you 're gonna get out of here And keep on keeping on killing Whoever gets in your way . Screw you . I don 't care if you are the dome ... Or whatever the hell else you are . I 'm the only one who can run this town . The whole town 's going down , and it 's your fault . You 've never sacrificed , Not once in your life , and now ... You 're gonna have to . Shut up and be dead ! I 'm busy . See ? You 're not listening . But you will . Barbie : All right , that 's it . That 's high enough . Just leave that alone . Here , let me see that tape . Looks like we 're all wired up . Do you think the magnet 's strong enough To generate a current to counteract the dome ? Gonna give the dome a run for its money . ( rumbling ) Barbie : No , no , no , no , let 's go . Everybody get back . Stand back , get back . Get back . ( generators whirring ) Joe : The magnet isn 't working . The charge needs time to build up . If it doesn 't work this time , How long till the next contraction ? It 'll work . Trust me . Dodee : Last warning . It won 't just be you who pays If you keep using the dome To make yourself king of chester 's mill . Who you talking about ? Sins of the father , jimmy , Are always visited on the son . Gah ! ( coughing ) ( high-pitched tone sounding ) ( indistinct murmuring ) ( gasping ) Joe ! Joe ! No ! ( panting ) ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ tender we fall ¶ ¶ quiet and alone ... ¶ Ma 'am ... Ma 'am , please ! ¶ tired and gone ... ¶ Mom ? James ? ¶ speechless ... ¶ Oh , my god . It is you . Why-why-why did you leave me ? No . No , baby , it was never you I left . Not ever , you 're my sweet boy . Not anymore . ¶ coming up for it ... ¶ ( laughs ) You can 't fool me , james . You never could . ( laughs ) You 're my sweet , Sweet boy . Big jim : Junior ! Junior ! Junior ! Oh , god . Can you hear me ? Junior ? Hang on . Junior ! Hang on ! Barbie ? I thought you were dead . Come on . You 're not gonna get rid of me that easy . I didn 't believe . You didn 't believe what ? That I was doing the right thing . That the dome would protect you . Babe , I don 't think it was the dome that saved me . Then how do you explain all this ? Some people say it 's from the magnetism , Not ' cause the dome 's angry . Joe ... He 's barely breathing . The next wave , maybe that takes us out , too . And then ... I-I don 't know how to fix this . Son , can you hear me ? Hang on . Just hang on . ( crying ) : Oh , god ... Tell me what you want me to do ! Tell me ! Oh , who the hell am I talking to ? Linda : You can talk to me , jim . What the hell are you supposed to be ? Ghost of christmas future ? The future depends on you . Tell me how I can help him . Come to me , jim . Come to me . Please , linda . Please , tell me ... Tell me what I can do . Come . Tell big jim rennie what to do ? I wouldn 't dare . Big jim rennie does as he pleases . Everything you do , You do it for your own good . Look at yourself . Look at your son . The only person left in this world You claim to care about . Time 's running out , jim . But it 's not too late . Not too late for what ? To learn the virtue of sacrifice . To save your son . ¶ ¶ ( breathing hard ) Jim ! What the hell are you doing ? What the dome wants me to do . I can 't pull the damn lever . Either of you want the honors ? I 'll do it . No ... Julia . Hey . Hey , you don 't have to do this . Why does it matter ? Just pull the damn lever . Do it . Do it . Do it now . Do it ! No ! I can 't do what you do . Coward . ( coughing , choking ) What ... ? The dome didn 't want us to kill you . It wants us to end the killing . ¶ ¶ ( indistinct chatter ) Sorry . ( crowd cheering ) It 's hard to believe a couple hours ago , They were all out cold . And a few hours before that , they were out for your blood . It 's easier than I thought to get there . You know , letting big jim live was the right thing to do . For today . Lucky for me , he felt the same about you . ( quiet laugh ) lucky for both of us . Rebecca : You went from grand theft auto To a gold star , mr . Barbara . Ah , I was just doing what the teacher told me . Um ... Rebecca here is the one who came up With the way to repel the dome 's magnetic pulses . And he did most of the heavy lifting . I-I tried to get a read on the rig , But my magnetometer 's blown . Really wish I 'd been conscious to see the tower work . Uh , you think That 's what stopped the surges ? And cleared the dome ? What else could it have been ? Something bigger than us . Refill , ange ? Thanks , hon . Mm-hmm . Barbie deserved to swing , And you let him go . What the hell , jim ? Phil , we got caught up looking for scapegoats . But we were wrong . And the dome told us so . ( snickers ) Barbie 's innocent . I 'm gonna make sure the good people of this town know it . Just be grateful we got out of this thing alive . Not all of us . We 'll have to carry on The good work of those we lost . What do you say , phil ? Can I count on you ? Helped out over at the fire tower today . I wanted to , uh , I wanted to thank you for pitching in . It was ms . Pine 's idea . Whatever works . I also heard you lost your house . I wanted to let you know that My home is your home . It might get a little cozy , but , uh ... Wait , what ? Come live with you ? Well , at least it 's a , uh , It 's a roof over your heads . Well , that 's really generous of you , jim . Thank you . You guys make yourselves at home . See you at supper . ( chuckles ) That magnet mess with your brain ? You keep your friends close and your enemies closer . Trust me , eleanor . My brain 's fine . Uh , uh , mr . Rennie ? Hi . Um , do you have a second ? As many as you like , ms . Pine . My , uh , wife always said you were her best student . Uh , today I learned why . The fire tower magnet got us through the day . But I 'm not gonna sleep tonight . Neither should you . Yeah , I think both of us need some sleep tonight . Those surges fried most of our power sources . Who knows what other damage they 've caused ? I 've got to survey our water supply , Determine how to find another source of power ... Look , uh , sunrise , new eyes . What do you say we figure this out Over breakfast tomorrow morning ? All right . Yeah . Great . Man : Yeah , actually I 'm almost done . Coffee ? Thanks . Mm-hmm . I think I 'll , uh , I 'll just go sit down . You know , It was a good thing that I wasn 't up on those gallows With you . ( quiet laugh ) 'cause I 'd have kicked out that trap door and danced While you hung at the end of the rope . Listen , angie . This all happened for a ... No , get off of me ! I 'm sorry . Go to hell . ( door closes ) What was that ? You had my back today . Do you still have it ? Of course I do . ( door closes ) Who 's that ? My uncle . Kid . You got big . You want to sit down ? No , thanks . I 'm looking for someone . She 's about 17 . Long dark hair , tall ? Yeah , that sounds like a girl I saw down the street earlier . But I didn 't recognize her . Which way did she go ? Toward the old food mart . Y-you want some help ? I got it . I 'll see you , junior . Julia : Barbie , pull over . I 'll be right back . Sam ? ( car door closes ) hey . How 's the girl ? She 's gone . I searched the woods around my cabin . I 've been looking all over town . She was in bad shape . I know , I 'm sorry . Well , she couldn 't have gone far , we 'll find her . You look flushed . You okay ? ( sighs ) Yeah , I 'm fine . Everything all right over here ? Barbie , this is sam verdreaux . Sam , dale barbara . Nice work on those stitches . Glad to see that you made it . You take good care . Last time I saw sam was mom 's funeral . Showing up just the way he did now . Well , you never can tell with him . Sam 's been out of his head for quite a while now . I don 't think it 's a coincidence . When I passed out earlier ... S-son ? What happened today . I 'm sorry I dismissed what you had to say . Maybe you 're right . About the dome ? Yes . Then listen to me . When I passed out earlier , it was like I went somewhere . And I saw mom . She talked to me . And then my uncle sam comes walking through the front door ? We all saw things today . Just because you dreamed about your mom Doesn 't mean she 's alive . No , no . This wasn 't a dream . This was real . Junior ... Don 't call me that ! My name is james . ( door closes ) James . ( sighs ) Male reporter : Breaking news on the mysterious dome That descended over the town of chester 's mill . There has still been no official statement On reported abnormal magnetic activity , Or why the temporarily opaque dome suddenly cleared . The world remains fascinated by the dome And concerned for those still trapped inside . Hello ? ¶ ¶ Are you okay ? No , no , no . No ! I 'm not gonna hurt you !

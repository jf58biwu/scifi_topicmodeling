 Previously on Caprica ... Tomas Vergis has taken my company away from me , and I want it back . The Guatrau is having me blackmail my own board of directors to get my company back . So , Terry Albick . No , I got nothing . He 's sleeping with his sister-in-law . You 'd be surprised what comes out at corporate retreats . I think we can count on his vote . Who 's next ? I tried to help my friend Zoe , but now I 'm in way too deep . I have a small task for you . A small but important task . Clarice ? Sister Clarice ? What about her ? I want you to replace the fob on her car keys with this . You put a bomb in her car . No ... You did , actually . Let 's see some terror . Oh , my God ! After Barnabas attempted murder , he left me no choice but to settle all STO business . Others need to be taught the price of disobedience . Are you going to kill me ? I hope not . Clarice was such a good friend to me , and now I 'm betraying her . These monotheists , they want nothing more than to have us either convert or destroy us . It 's not the monotheists . They don 't care about ... It 's the terrorists . I think your friend , Clarice Willow , is one . Why are you telling me this ? Because I need your help ! You have intimate access to an STO leader . You want me to spy on my friend ? Is that it ? I 'm called a death walker because I can 't die in V-World . I 've seen this symbol around the city . It belongs to the other dead walker . She didn 't derez . She was shot , but she 's not derezzing . Any ideas where she is ? I hear you can 't die . But you can bleed . You can hurt . Look who showed up . Death walker ! I 'm looking for the death walker . You don 't find the death walker . She finds you . Whatever this game is , I 'm not playing it . To enter is a challenge . Rules are rules . Ave , death walker ! You fight or die . Daddy , help ! You ever been shot before ? Really hurts , doesn 't it ? By the way , you found me . You didn 't because you 're useless . You tried to kill us , but you didn 't because you 're useless . Worthless ! Did you think we wouldn 't find you ? I don 't even know why Clarice wants you here . It 's okay . I won 't let the others hurt you . Cyrus . What 's going on ? What is the board doing here ? Chairman has called for an emergency vote . What emergency ? I believe it 's a motion to reinstate Daniel Graystone as the CEO . Hey , Parker . What the frak is going on ? Albick ! Look me in the eye , Gods damn it . Let 's be civil and give them the room . They 'll call when they need you . Shall we ? Daniel , you have a phone call . Yes , put it through . Daniel . Yes . Vote 's in . 14-zip . Congratulations . Thank you . Why did you bring her here ? I don 't have to answer to you , Mar-Beth . Of course not . The rules of this marriage don 't apply to you . Be careful what you both say . We don 't need the kids talking . Right . About the teenaged girl tied up in the attic ? Speaking of which . Are you almost done with Lacy ? Almost . Good . Well , I 'm going back to Amanda at the cabin . But why ? Because it is what God wants . Zoe ? Zoe ? You 're back . You 're drawing the fire . Yes , when we first met . Thanks for saving me and being my friend . Welcome back . Wait . Please , just listen to me . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , okay ? Look , I just ... I practiced this so many times in my head the last few weeks . I think you and I are the same . People say you 're the other one who can 't be killed . That 's true . I can 't . Yeah , okay . So , look , I think that you and I , we could bring ... So , do you remember that maglev bombing , the one that killed my mother and I ? According to that , you did it . Oh , that . Yes , that . Help ! Please help ! They 're keeping me prisoner ! Help ! Why are you doing this ? Help ! Help ! I 'm gonna miss this place . Yeah , me , too . Clarice , can I come home with you ? Don 't be silly . Anyway , I don 't think my family would like it . Come on , we can 't keep the cabbie waiting . You 're drugging me . You motherfrakkers . You 're drugging me . Want a drink ? No , thank you , I 'm fine . We just didn 't want you to think that the transition 's over . What , you ... You want to take out Vergis ? Has to be done . According to whom ? You and Sam , or ... You know , the whole point of cooking up the vote was so that I could get back in somewhat legitimately . And you did , but Vergis is Tauron . He 'll never lie down . Allowed to live , he 'll come back . He must be returned to the soil . And then what ? And then his brother comes after you , and Sam goes after him . Daniel , I think you know where this is coming to . Yeah . With someone dead . Look , let me ... Let me talk to him . Let me try and reason with him . He 's a man of business . We speak the same language . No . You speak Caprican . Human beings value life . That 's one of the main things that makes us slightly more evolved than animals . Understanding the value of life . Other things have value . All right . Well , look , if I don 't at least try , then I 'm no better than ... Me ? Him . Hello , Amanda . This is a welcome surprise . Hello , Serge . Is Daniel here ? Not at the moment . Would you like me to ping him ? No , that 's all right . Hey , come on . Come on . You gotta eat . You gotta be hungry . Very hungry . But the next time I eat , it 's because Clarice brings me food herself and tells me what she wants . I 'll tell her . Okay , wait . Just let me explain . Yes , please explain why you deliberately slaughtered hundreds of innocent people , all for your meaningless fictional God . You took my life and my mother 's . That wasn 't me , okay ? She died on that train . It says so right here . Look , I 'm a copy , okay ? Just like you . You 're lying . I 'm not a copy . I have all of my memories , all the feelings I had , and it stands to reason you do , too . It 's hard to explain . You know , there are a lot of people in New Cap City who had friends and family on that train . You know that I 'm not Original Zoe . Tell it to them . But I don 't think they care . My father was on that maglev train . This won 't bring him back . It might feel pretty good , though . Lacy . Oh . Poor thing . It 's gonna be okay . I 'm scared . I need your help , not your fear . If you 're like me , you 'll heal soon enough . So why won 't you fight back ? You don 't know where I 've been lately . I 'm tired of fighting . I 'm not . Maybe you just won 't fight because you know you deserve this . Is that true ? Is that what you think ? It 's you . I remember you . Hey , Dad . Hi , sweetheart . Can I go snow-ramming with Lacy and the guys this weekend ? Sure . Sounds like fun . You know , we buy a season pass , so actually it works out being cheaper . I like the way you 're thinking . You know , that 's like ... I used to draw those . Did you ? Yeah . Maybe I saw it and it stuck in my head somewhere . How close is it to done ? Oh , don 't even ask . I can tell you all about it tomorrow . I am exhausted . Don 't stay up too late . Don 't mess with my settings . Look . Same legs . Brain 's in the chest , not in the head . He 's got plenty of time for you when he wants to steal an idea . He 's not stealing anything from me . You know what would infuriate him ? Beating him at the thing he 's best at . I don 't want to beat him . Besides , I can design a chassis . It 's not the same as making a robot . Think of something bigger . And what would I create ? Life 's a good start , I think . Come on ! Oh , God , let it be that I got this right . Whoa . That 's okay . You don 't have to talk yet . You 're brand-new . God , if I did this right , you 're me . Welcome to the world . Well , V-World , anyway . I can talk . You can talk . I 'm you , right ? I have your memories . I can feel them . And you can talk . Right . But I 'm still gonna have to make you take some tests . Memory tests , like profile stuff , just to see how good you are . Good idea . By the way , I don 't remember making me , so that could already be a possible problem . No , that 's okay . You won 't remember anything that happened since I last scanned myself . Don 't worry . You 're probably perfect . A perfect copy . Right now , yeah . But what I meant is perfectly alive . Starting right now , you 're a person . But I can 't leave V-World . A person with restricted movement is still a person . Come over here . Let 's test you out a little bit . You 're not her . You 're not the same . You keep walking in her footprints even after her footprints stopped . You didn 't have to . You and she knew that . Now are you gonna lie down and pay for her sins ? Or are you gonna own yourself ? You know , I don 't care if you 're not the Original Zoe . For now , you 're more alive than she is , and you deserve everything you 're getting . I think you have me confused with someone else . So , are you ready to talk to me now ? You never asked me anything . Why ? I didn 't know if I could trust you . I still don 't . Where do you get off being all moral ? You killed my friends . For all I know , you killed Zoe , too . You were the one who tried to blow me up . I didn 't want to do that . Well , that would have sounded very moving at my funeral . There wouldn 't have been a dry eye in the house . And for the record , I would never have harmed Zoe . Now , to show you meant me no harm , you need to help me . Zoe 's resurrection program , it was uploaded from her computer after she died . What happened to it ? She 's gone , Lacy . This is not a betrayal . She would want you to help me . We were working together . And if you do tell me , your burden will be lifted . The avatar lived on . She was ... She was inside one of her dad 's robots . Where is it now ? Destroyed . It crashed , and she disappeared . She 's gone , and so is the program . Wasn 't there a backup ? Not that I know of . No , no . Zoe was very careful . She wouldn 't have been so unprepared . Think , Lacy . Wait . She had a pin . It was shaped like an infinity symbol . I don 't know . There was some way she kept stuff in there . A compartment . It could have been data . You sure ? If she had a backup , that 's where she would have kept it . Thank you . So what happens now ? Hmm . That 's a good question . The way my husbands are feeling about you right now , I think it would be very healthy for you to go off-world . Off-world ? There 's a program on Gemenon , training for STO recruits . It 'll help you get properly focused on your walk with God . I can 't go to Gemenon . My mom ... We 'll take care of her . Now , clean yourself up and Olaf will drive you to the Spaceport . No ! Listen to me carefully , Lacy . I am trying to save your life . Do you understand ? There 's been enough blood . Go upstairs and clean her up and don 't let anybody see her . Clarice Willow is here to see you . I wasn 't expecting to see you so soon . I haven 't even seen Daniel yet . Well , I was thinking about you rattling about this place all on your own , and I was worried . I 'm fine . Really . I wonder if you 'd be able to get all her things back now . I don 't want her things . I mean , memories are attached to things , don 't you think ? If you had her ... All her trinkets and jewelry and ... You know , little personal things , the things that the GDD confiscated , they might trigger good memories of Zoe . I mean , I came across something she gave me the other day . A diary . She gave you her diary ? Yeah , but it was a blank one for me to use . And she said to me to record all my good deeds in it . And I said , " Well , that sounds a little bit too much like hubris . " Shouldn 't I record all my bad deeds in it ? " And she said , well , she should 've gotten me a bigger book . Yeah , that sounds just like her . You know , Clarice , maybe that 's why we were brought together . Some kind of destiny . Some way of keeping Zoe alive . I think that 's why I wanted to come and stay with you so badly . I just have this feeling that there 's more . Have you unpacked yet ? Now , this way . Everybody , this is Amanda Graystone . She 's gonna be staying with us for a while . What are you gonna do ? You gonna kill me ? Have you not been paying attention ? Neither one of us can die . Make her bleed ! It 's a one-way ticket , but I know you 'll be back . I can 't wait . I remember you from the dark room , Tamara . I know how scared you are . We 're nothing alike . We are . You have great abilities here . Why get caught up in this , like all of them ? You 're better than this . I 'm tired Of listening to all of your crap . That girl I was , that girl you remember , she 's gone . You put me here , so stop talking . See , I get that . I get that on a personal level . That girl is gone . So what does this girl like and what does this girl hate ? They like watching your pain . They don 't care which one of us bleeds . Look at them . Is that what you want to be ? Entertainment ? New Cap City is disgusting . It 's a place for people to come and act out their own worst impulses , to kill , rape , destroy . It 's wrong ! Why do you care ? I have a purpose . And I know that now . I think this is it , or a step on the way . I don 't know . But I think you 're supposed to help me . I 'm glad you agreed to come , Tomas . I want you to know that I 've spoken to the board and they are drawing up a severance agreement as we speak . Uh-huh . So I can slink back to the Tauron dirt , where I belong . Not at all . Take a look at this contract . I 've given you more than I had to . A lot more . You 're going to make a big , fat profit on this entire affair . Think I want your charity ? It 's not charity . It is a begrudging gesture of respect . You played me well . You caught me napping and took advantage . I turned the tables . It 's all part of the game . Let 's shake hands and live to fight another day . Frakking Capricans . Where are your stones ? You know how this has to end ? This is business , Tomas , just business . Nothing more . Actually , it 's a little bit more than that to me . You made a deal with the Ha 'la 'tha , with Taurons . And whatever your fine principles , they will not let me live . So ... Why not now ? You made me dead . Finish the job . I invite you to my home , and you bring a weapon ? I 'm extending an olive branch . I 'm trying to put an end to the bloodshed . Whatever they have told you , they are obligated to kill me . The Guatrau will settle for nothing less . I know the Guatrau . He 's not an unreasonable man . You have no idea who you 're dealing with . You do not reason with the Guatrau . I will not make it off-world alive . I accept that . " Control your return to the soil . " Meaning , " Plan your death . " I am Tauron . It is important to me to die at the moment and time of my choosing . I choose here . Now . At the hands of my enemy . Well ... That ... That isn 't going to happen . The Ha 'la 'tha , they 're a group of small-minded , vicious thugs . No more . With some amount of power . That is correct . But you and I , we have resources beyond anyone 's wildest imagining . I propose a pact . Graystone and Vergis . We combine efforts . We protect each other and we devote our resources toward the total destruction of the Ha 'la 'tha . We can do it . At the very least , we can put them on the run , drive them underground . Return them to the soil . Yes . Yes . Maybe I was wrong . I overreacted . We 're both powerful men . Think of what we can accomplish together . Exactly . It was my father 's . His father 's before him , so on . Swear an oath on this blade and we will be brothers . Hello . Joseph , it 's Daniel . I need your help .

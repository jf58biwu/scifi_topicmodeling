 Eva . What are you doing here ? Where 's your mother ? Alex . - Long time no see . - Been waiting long ? No . Only ten years . Let 's go , I 'm freezing . You 've done well for yourself . You 've made some amazing robots . I got bored of all that years ago . Bored of designing boring robots ? No . Bored of designing fun robots for boring people . I prefer lecturing . Students make me laugh more . Are you going to Dad 's house ? It will be a mess . - You could stay with us . - No , no . Thanks . - Do you know why they called you ? - Yes . It must be important to bring you all this way . Very important . Damn it , Alex , always so mysterious . Come over for dinner tomorrow , okay ? And welcome home . Check out that cat . Check out that guy ! Good morning , Alex Garel . Hello , Dorotea . I 'm here to see Julia . Julia is busy right now . You don 't look a day older . You 're beautiful . You can 't go in , she 's giving a class . Alex Garel ! You must never manipulate your robot 's character . You have 30 minutes to do the test . And remember , try not to alter their profiles . Good morning , Julia . Some things never change . Late as always . Raise the frequency . As you can see although the software is much more advanced . - What ? - The nob on the right ! - What now ? - Turn it down . He 's coming . - I know ! - He 's coming over ! Stupid robot , stop making noise . " Stupid student , stop hurting me . " I 'm sorry . What do we do now ? What do you see when you close your eyes ? Now you 've broken it . We could restart it and reinsert its bases . You can restart it , yes , but you have destroyed its emotional memory . Its soul . See ? It 's dead . If you restart it , it 'll look like the same horse , but it 'll never be the same again . " What do you see when you close your eyes ? " That command is sacred . It must only be used in extreme cases when there is no other option . Understood ? So , do you want to see it ? Draw me a tree . Come on , focus . I 'm bored , I don 't want to draw any more . The S.I.-9 , just as you designed it ten years ago . All finished and assembled : endoskeletal structure , muscle mechanisms , even the outer shell . But it 's missing the most important part of all . The emotional intelligence software . Reproducing the emotions of a child is foolish . That 's what you said . It 's only human to make mistakes . The first free robot . Incredible , isn 't it ? Is this how you imagined it ? Why me ? To be honest , you aren 't the first to try . But you 're the only one capable of designing a robot which is fun but safe . Alex , this is your chance to finish what you started . Yeah . But I 'm not working here . Where will you go ? My parents ' house . All right . That 's how emotional intelligence affects robot behaviour . A certain event will affect us differently , depending on our mood and the circumstances in which we find ourselves . Are you okay ? Yes . Nobody has been in here since your father died . Are you sure you want to stay here ? It 's only a bit of dust . You 're crazy . We 'll install all the equipment tomorrow , but you must also come and see the models . We need to choose a child to base the android on . Alex Garel ? S.I.-7. Good morning , sir . I 'm Max , no surname . The university sent me to do housework and anything else you need . - I don 't understand . - Company policy . To avoid all that : " There 's no need , honestly . I don 't want to trouble you " . They just send me . Call them , if you don 't believe me . No , thanks . You can go now . Level 5 : food ... plus clothes ... Plus ... Cat ! Luckily , it doesn 't have fur . Plus general tidy up of random objects . - They 're the worst , random objects . - But ... It 's okay , I 'm a machine , I 'm used to it . If you don 't mind , I 'll start now . I 'm a " business before pleasure " kind of guy . Come along , sir . Here . This is your leisure time . What do you do in your free time ? I work . In my dictionary , " work " and " leisure " are antonyms . We 'll have to solve that , sir . Coffee ? A coffee and a walk will do you good . It 's a beautiful day for it , sir . You have many skills . More than you think , sir . I was created by David Garel 's team . My brother ? I 'm designed for a multitude of tasks . I 'm a gourmet chef , a butler , a carer for the elderly , a monitor for children ... I speak 29 languages . I even have advanced knowledge of DIY , plumbing , electrics ... I saw some roof tiles outside , sir , which need replacing . And don 't call me " sir " , Max . Thank you , Alex . - What about that walk ? - Not sure I fancy it . Please . It will do you good . Besides , I need space to work . Come on , Gris , let 's go . We 're in the way here . I 'll be outside . If you don 't eat that sweet , I 'll give you 5 more when I 'm back . If you don 't eat that sweet , I 'll give you 5 sweets later . But don 't eat it , okay ? As you can see , we did several tests . Including the incitement test . - The good old sweet test . - That 's right . - What do you think ? - Of what ? Of the kids . You have to choose one . We need a model for the robot . These kids aren 't right . None of them . They 're all ... boring . - Boring ? Yes , boring . Who 'd want to live with them ? Their parents perhaps ? They don 't count . With an ordinary child you 'll get an ordinary robot . Alex ! That is how emotional intelligence works when applied to robotics . The fluid logic and genetic algorithms allow us to design a variable artificial brain . What does that mean ? That of all the options available , it always chooses the one best-suited to the individual in front of it . Okay , guys , we 'll pick it up here tomorrow . How strange ! Alex Garel in a classroom . It 's only the second time I 've seen it . You see that ? Now they study your absurd theories . I don 't know why , they 're no use to anyone . But they don 't come here to hear my stupid theories . No ? Then why do they come ? They come to see you . Right . I have a meeting . Turn the light off on your way out . What are you looking at ? I wasn 't looking . Oh , really ? What do you call fixing your gaze on something ? Watching . Then you were watching me . - Do you do this often ? - What ? Watching kids . Yes , I do . Cool . A pervert who can admit what he is . - At least you 're original . - It not what you think . I do it for ... work . If you make excuses it 's less original . So it 's part of your work ? Really ? You don 't interest me any more . Bye ! Wait ! Like in the movies . What ? In the movies , when she walks away , he shouts " Wait ! " . She turns around , and then he kisses her . What 's your name ? Eva . Would you like a sweet ? Just one . Just one ? You 're a professional pervert . - What flavour are they ? - I don 't know . I don 't like those . But I 'll take both ! You want a sweet ? It 's " I don 't know " flavour . " I don 't know " which tastes of strawberry . I work at the university and I 'm making a robot . If you want , and if your parents let you , I 'd love to work with you . You really are a very unusual pervert . But I have to go home . See you around ! Just in time . Lunch is ready , despite all this mess . - How was your walk ? - Fine . The technicians from the university came . They brought a complete prototype and various motor areas . The hand-up is already installed . This is delicious , Max . I also made a basket for the cat . Oh , no . No you don 't . You can walk all around here , but don 't you dare make a mess . Alex , it doesn 't micturate , does it ? Alex , this cat must be faulty , maybe you should repair it . Gris is a free robot , he does what he wants . He doesn 't meet some of the safety requirements , but he 's good company . A free robot ? I 've never heard of that . It 's an illegal application . Just take care of him , and try to get along . Hear that , my feline companion ? Alex is going to eat now and then we 'll let him work . Don 't be a naughty kitty . Max , what emo level are you on ? Standard level eight . We 're not used to such emotional robots . Take it down to six . Done , Mr Garel . Level six . You can still call me Alex . Thank you . CURIOUS CHEERFUL Smoke . Smoke . RECEPTIVE Smoke . Hello ? Hello , calamity . Hello . Can you come for dinner tomorrow ? - I 've got a lot of work . - Right ... Nine o 'clock . Don 't be late . David ... FEARFUL Alex , come up . Good evening . Hi . - How are you ? - Good . Nice flowers . Wine ? Of course . How was Dad 's house looking ? In a real mess . I 've met Max . Congratulations . Hi . Thanks . How was Australia ? Any Australian girlfriends ? Nothing serious . Alex has always preferred robots to women . - Women talk too much . - That 's true . Hi . What 's with all the smoke ? - What 's for dinner ? - Soup . Eva , this is your Uncle Alex . Nice to meet you . Let 's get the soup . I 'm very happy for you . We ended up designing robotic cells to implant into patients . - Does it work ? - It 's viable . That 's wonderful . And why did you leave ? - To work at a better place . - Better than Santa Irene ? - I don 't believe that . - Neither do I. How did it go with Julia ? What did she give you ? - And don 't tell me it 's secret . - You know I can 't speak about it . Who 's Julia ? Julia is a very grumpy , very clever woman . How about a toast ? - To old times . - And to secrets . Hey , do you remember Eric 's robot ? Who 's Eric ? Eric was a friend who made a robot to do everything for him because he was lazy . No , not peas ! Peas ! Peas ! No ! Not peas ! No ! Not peas ! Is that for the S.I.-9 ? Isn 't that girl a bit wacky to be the model for a robot ? Yes , I 'm looking for a fun model . Don 't move ! It 's only anti rust spray . Pervert ! Man , you can sleep ! I 've been waiting half an hour . You 'll break your neck one day . My mum says that to learn something , you have to fall many times . So , are you coming inside ? Or are you afraid ? You weren 't listening . What my mum means is that I shouldn 't be afraid of anything . What are you laughing at ? Welcome . Please , take a seat . You 'll be more comfortable . Something to read ? That 's better , isn 't it ? Much better . Get down ! I don 't mind . What 's your name ? He 's called Gris . He 's a prototype , and he doesn 't talk , he just meows . He 's the only robot with free function . Isn 't that right , Gris ? All right , I 'm S.I.-7 , Max , no surname to my friends . A pleasure to meet you . The pleasure is mine . I 'm Eva , no surname to my friends . - You want to play a game , Eva ? - Okay . Surprised . Tired . Happy . God knows why . One word only . Define it in just one word . Happy . Furious . Angry . Very good . Perceptive . I 'm just making it more fun . Are you bored ? I don 't know what this is for , but it seems a waste of time . Your reactions help me to configure the robot 's emotional memory . It 's going to be one boring robot . I thought you wanted to make something different . That 's what I 'm trying to do . If you help me , it will be like you . It will laugh and get cross just like you . One more and we 're done , okay ? Sad . Are you sure ? Look carefully . He 's crying . People don 't always cry because they 're sad . - What would you say ? - Happy . - What ? - This man just won a race . So what ? He 's sad because he won . Why would winning make him sad ? Because he knows he can 't always win . In that case , when someone loses , they should laugh , because they know they won 't lose all their life . Wow . The girl with all the answers has no answer . Yes , I do . You 're funny when you 're angry . Don 't laugh at me ! - Open the door . - Where are you going ? Open the door ! Doon . If you think I 'm going to follow you , you 're wrong . Doon . Well , well . You 're back . If you won 't come and look for me , I 'll have to come back on my own . But on one condition . If you want my help , you have to show it to me . This is the processor . It 's the robot 's brain . A brain ? It 's huge . Actually , it 's not that big . It 's as small ... as a bee . - What are these pieces ? - They 're character components . This piece , for example , is aggression . And that one ? This one ? This one ... is pride . It 's very small to be pride . And now we switch it on . It 's pretty . What 's happening to him ? He 's reacting to what he sees . Forming a memory based on his experiences , just like a human . And this , Eva , is how the S.I.-9 sees you . Now your head . - It 's scalding me . - No it isn 't . Stop whining . I went to Alex 's house today . When ? After school . You said you were going to Maria 's house . I don 't see Maria any more . I 've told you not to ride your bike out of town . But I was careful . I don 't care if you 're careful , I don 't want you to do it . I 'm sorry . Promise me you won 't do it again . You 'll get no bedtime story . I promise . Why don 't you ever talk about Alex ? Because Daddy was angry when he left . Very angry ? Yes . And you ? Me too . Why ? Because we were studying together , we were working on a shared project , we were fond of each other , and then he just left . And that made us sad and angry . Did you love him like you love Daddy ? Yes , more or less . More ? Or less ? Why are you such a little gossip ? You look happy . I am . Have you come to tell me something ? What would happen if we made a girl instead of a boy ? Alex , I 've told you , S.I.-9 is a boy . We just need your emotional reaction program . Emotional reaction ? Look , boys are clumsy and boring . Girls are sweeter , more mature , more sensitive ... and much prettier . But they are also more perverse , more jealous and twisted . And I know all this because , many , many years ago , I was one . Now get your arse back to work , I don 't pay you to sit here eating my biscuits . Not that many years ago . So you don 't do research now ? You prefer lecturing ? I love lecturing . It 's very different , but I have a quieter life . You seem happy . Yes , we are . And you ? Have you found someone to break your heart ? Alex , Eva told me about the tests , and ... I 'd rather you didn 't do them with her . I just want her to do what little girls do , so if you don 't mind ... Yes , of course . I 'm sorry . No ... - She 's just so special . - Yes . She is . But what did you expect ? She 's my daughter . Well ... I 'll see you around . Good luck . Thanks . You must be happy . You had them begging you to come back . You know I was never the boastful one . Or the nice one . But you were the clever one . We 're both very clever . I disagree . I am extremely talented . - And modest . - But you ... are one in a million . I suppose that 's why I 'm the handsome one . You were very handsome , yes . Guess who I saw the other day . Gloria . Why didn 't you ask her out ? There 's a party next week . - I think she never got over you . - We were twelve . You know what they say about your first love . You never forget it . Yeah . Morning ! I thought you would dodge it . Eva , we can 't do this . Your parents don 't want you to come here . So what ? I want to , and you need me . There are other kids . But not like me . With an ordinary kid , you 'll get an ordinary robot . Come on , open the door . Eva , come down . Okay , fine . Just forget it . What a shame . I wanted to tell you the story of David and Mum . What story ? Open the door first . All right . We 'll do unofficial tests . You just have fun and I 'll observe you . Okay ? Okay , pervert . Eva , Eva , slow down . Come on , slowcoach . Go on , try it . - What ? - This . Turn around . I 'll get stuck . No , no , no . Okay . - Like this . - What ? Do this . No , don 't move your bum . Like this , like this . Don 't fall . Pen . Writing . Story . Mum . Woman . Pretty . Garden . Ground ! Ground . Strong . Stone . Grey . Cat . Robot . Free . Happy . You haven 't fallen enough . What ? When Mum sees someone who can 't climb , she says : " They haven 't fallen enough . " She says that ? You wouldn 't like her to say it about you . Listen . Between your mother and I ... There 's nothing . She 's a wonderful person , and very pretty , but we split up years ago . And although my expression changes whenever I hear her name , it 's only the memory of good times we spent together . What are you saying ? Nothing . It 's what you 'd say if we were in a movie . Clumsy idiot ! It 's the town . Now what ? See that house there ? Which one ? - There are lots . - It doesn 't matter . That 's my house . You brought me up here to tell me that ? And also to tell you that that house over there , on the way to the university ... That 's David 's house . You don 't live together . And ? Don 't tell me you 're not pleased to hear it . Come on , we have more tests to do . - A deal is a deal . - You 're going to kill me . Who 's that ? It 's Eva . How old is she ? Ten . She seems nice . Is she your daughter ? No . She looks a lot like you . You won 't beat me ! That 's what you think . My turn . Hello . Hello . What are you doing here ? Did you come to see us ? Yes , I came to see if you were home , but it 's late now . Come inside for a drink . No , no , thanks . I have to go . Right . Your secret projects . Will you come to the graduation party ? - I don 't know ... - Yes , come . Everyone wants to see you . Okay , we 'll see . Hello ! How 's my little girl ? Hello , David . Hello , love . - How are you ? - What 's going on ? We 're playing sleds . - Let 's push Daddy off . - You want to push Daddy ? Worried . Funny . QUICK Hungry . No . Sweet-toothed . Perfect . PERFECTIONIST Bored . Are you sure ? Yes . This woman is tired . We also yawn when we 're tired . She 's bored and that 's making her tired . Sure , just like tiredness makes you bored . That works for everything . CREATIVE Don 't laugh . Why not ? Because . Don 't laugh . I 'm laughing because you 're funny . I 'm not funny ! Sit down . No . Sit down ! - Sit down ! - I don 't want to ! What are you doing ? - I told you to sit down . - No ! What are you doing ? I 'm leaving ! - Where ? - I 'm leaving ! You can 't leave . - Why not ? - The door is locked . - Open it ! - No . I said open it ! I 'm ordering you to sit down . - I told you to open the door ! - No . - Open it now ! - No ! Yes ! What do you see when you close your eyes ? What happened ? Not now , Max . - Mr Garel . - Hello . Hello , Mr Garel . - How are you ? - Fine . - You remember Manuel ? - Yes . Hello , Alex . Julia tells me you 're working at home . You should work here , at the university . - Leave it . - Really . Who are you hiding from ? Nobody . Here 's to your bright future . Look at this . Drinking already . Hello , Alex . Are you boring my wife ? I 'm working on it . How 's the prototype going ? Who wants to dance ? Alex doesn 't dance . Right ? Thanks . May I ? Of course . Have you been practising ? No . You dance much better . Where did David go ? Will you help me find him ? It 's so cold . And to think I missed this place . But you also hated it here . Are you going to stay ? When you finish the project . Will you stay ? I might not finish it . Well , you should . For once . Or haven 't you changed ? I think I 've changed . Right . You haven 't forgiven me ? No . It was ten years ago . Ten years is nothing . I 'd need another ten . I can 't . Alex , no . I can 't . Lana ! What do you want ? What else do you want ? You left her once already . Go away . Do you need something ? Yes . Turn your emo level back up to 8 . Alex , what 's the matter ? It 's nothing , Max . But thanks . Well , well ... Who hit you ? The S.I.-9 ? No . I 'm not going to finish the S.I.-9. Leaving the job half done again ? Alex , you 're a great creator , maybe the best . But if you don 't finish your projects , it doesn 't matter how good you are ... Take a break for a few days and then we 'll talk . It 's because of her , right ? What are you looking at ? Are your parents home ? Sad . What ? You have a sad face . Why did you lie to me , Eva ? Why did you say that David didn 't live with you ? That was what you wanted to hear . Eva , I 'm leaving . You can 't . You can 't leave now , now that I 've finally found you . It 's not fair . Alex ... I 'm very sorry about what happened . Eva tells me you 're leaving . Do you want me to go ? Alex , I need to tell you something . " Eva is a very special little girl . " She is like us both because we made her . Eva ! Eva ! Eva ! Wait , I 'll go with you . No . I have to tell her myself . Will you come back ? Of course . Eva ! Eva ! My God . No . Eva . Mummy , what happened to me ? Nothing , sweetie . Everything is okay . Mummy , it 's not okay . What 's this ? Take it easy , or you 'll faint again . Please . - Everything 's fine now . - Don 't touch me . I should have told you before . - Let 's go home . - Don 't touch me . I don 't want to . - What am I ? - You 're my little girl . Eva . What are you doing here ? Where 's your mother ? Hello ? Yes , David . Eva is here . What ? Eva ... Did something bad happen ? Alex is very upset . How can I help you ? I pushed her . I pushed her . It 's all right . I pushed her . Everything will be okay . I pushed her . I pushed her . I pushed her . I pushed her . You know that Lana was as good as you . She finished the project after you left . Lana was the first to design the S.I.-9. Eva , as you know her . When we tested her , she didn 't pass the safety control . But Lana wanted to keep her , she gave up everything for her . And I let her . That was a mistake . Alex , we have to destroy her . She 's a little girl . No , she 's not . I know what she is . She killed Lana . Julia , let me do it . No . It 's my responsibility . Julia ! I 'll do it . Hello , princess . It 's very early . Can we go skating ? I 'm sure I won 't fall today . All right . Try it ! Look , Eva ! No , not like that ! Like this ! Alex , come and join us ! Beautiful , isn 't it ? Mum brought me here first . When the sun went down it got really cold , but I didn 't want to leave until all the lights came on . It 's beautiful , Eva . I 'd never seen it like this . Alex , you have to promise to help me . I don 't want to be bad again . I want to be a good girl . Dinner is ready . Alex , after dinner , I 'd like you to read to me , a book which Mummy read to me every night . It 's called " One Thousand and One Nights " and it 's about a princess and a prince who must kill her before she falls asleep . But every night , she tells him a beautiful story which never ends . He can 't kill her because he wants to hear more . And so it goes on like that , night after night ... Until the prince decides to pardon the princess so she can continue telling him those stories forever . Alex , you 're not going to fix me , are you ? Eva ... What do you see when you close your eyes ? She is like us both because we made her . Just one ? You 're a professional pervert . Do this . No , don 't move your bum . Like this . Why are you such a little gossip ? We were studying together , we were working on a shared project , we were fond of each other , and then he just left . What do you see when you close your eyes ? I see light . Lots of light . I see you , Daddy and I see Mummy , and me , all of us together , playing forever . Translation : Daniel Robert Murray Subtitles : LASERFILM

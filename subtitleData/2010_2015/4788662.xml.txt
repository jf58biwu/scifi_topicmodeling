 The Government is coming under increasing pressure to take urgent action to reduce the soaring cost of food . The latest Food Price Index indicates that many food commodities on international markets have doubled in value in the last six months , reflected by rocketing prices . A group of backbench MPs have called for an emergency ... We 're closed . We 're closed ! What ? No , look , we 're closed , what are you doing ? Come here a minute . You had this . Where is it ? What 's the matter with you ? I just said we 're close ... Oh , no . Oh , no ... I sold it , I have . Oh , no . Oh , no . Who ? Er ... That 's ... That 's all I 've got , honest . Can I go ? Can I just go , please ? Not yet . It 's OK . This 'll just make you sleep is all . What ? Really ? Where is Jessica Hyde ? Who ... Who 's she ? Where is Jessica Hyde ? Is ... Is she a customer ? Because if she 's a customer , I can find her , I can find her on the ... Where is Jessica Hyde ? I 'm thinking so hard . I really am , I just ... I don 't know that name . No , I ... It 's just gas . You 've got to sleep . I 'm gasping . I 'll light it outside . Don 't put the gas away yet . I mean , the thing is ... it 's a comic . No , it 's a graphic novel . It 's called The Utopia Experiments . It 's about a scientist who makes a deal with the devil for knowledge . And the devil appears in a number of guises , but always as an animal-human hybrid , most notably a rabbit ... A rabbit ? Yeah . Oh , so he 's in it , then ? The guy that wrote this , it 's about him ? Hardly original , I mean Bukowski . Hmm . His name was Mark Dane . He was a delusional paranoid schizophrenic . He spent two years in a mental institution called Shenley , where he wrote this and then killed himself , which ... adds to the conspiracy . It can be linked to BSE , the assassination of Indira Gan ... Conspiracy 's not really very now . Are you saying that you think this is real ? Because that 's a bit ... Can I actually say what I want to say ? ! No-one 's attacking you , Becky . You studied medicine . Up until May , you were on course to be a doctor , so ... why the sudden change ? My father died . My father had a degenerative illness called Deel 's syndrome , where his entire body shut down . His fingers , arms , legs , hands , until all that was left was his throat , and when that stopped working , he suffocated to death . Becky , no-one is attacking you ... Look , are you going to fucking fund this or what ? ! I mean , look at you ! I 've had a look at your website . You 've got people doing PhDs in ... Star Wars and Doctor fucking Who ! Martin needs the RDS sheets . I 'm doing that , I 'm just ... No , you 're not , you 're messing about on forums . I 'm not messing around on forums . He needs these before Frankfurt . Why aren 't you doing them ? Because it 's so tedious it 's making my eyes bleed . You think you 're so much better than everyone else . No . I think we 're all morons . Just ... fucking do it , Ian ! I mean ... if you 've got any questions , ask . Actually , I ... I do have one question . Martin 's penis . Is that a meaty taste , or is it more salty ? Very witty , Ian , so smart . Or do you just not think of that and get on with the job in hand ? Yeah , well , I 've got a joke for you . You 're 28 years old and you still live at home with your mum . Ha ! That 's a laugh ! Wilson Wilson ... Jesus Christ , Grant . 780 members , and it has to be Grant . Becky , Becky , Becky ... Hello , Becky . Jesus Christ ... Hi , hon ! Michael ? Where are you ? Are you OK ? Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'm fine , I 'm , eh at work ! I 'll be a little late . You sound a little bit out of kilter . No , I 'm fine , Jen . D-Department of Health politics is all . I love you . Yeah , course you do . Idiot . And are you ... OK about tomorrow ? About the clinic ? What ? Yeah , of course . I have a good feeling this time . Heh ... Look , I 'd better go . You get my whore pregnant . You want your wife to know ? You want your minister to know ? Look , look ... I-I 'm not anyone , I 'm just a civil servant . Senior civil servant . You 're private secretary to the minister . Important . No . No , no , no , no , no , no , you 're wrong , I 'm no-one . Shut your fucking shit mouth ! You think I care about you or your bitch wife ? You do a mission for me , yeah ? Mission ? What are you ... ? You get my whore pregnant , you think this is game ? We play game , spy game . I have friends . Do mission for my friends , yeah ? You do what we say or I fuck your life . And then there 's the secondary-care waiting times for cancer patients . We 'll have to set those on the ... No , no , that 's medical . Let Deidra set those in consultation with the GMC . Sure ? Cancer makes the papers . Geoff won 't be happy . Oh , bollocks to Geoff . And , of course , there 's this meeting with Corvadt tomorrow . Oh , Christ . Conran Letts himself , no less . He 'll just to try and flog me that bloody Russian flu vaccine . I 'll have to take Michael with me or I won 't understand a fucking word . Michael . A penny for your thoughts . Shit , vaccines ! That reminds me , we 've got to get the updated rubella before GPs start griping . I 'll get you that to you today , Michael . That 's me , Joe . Funeral , is it ? You 're not wearing black . You get serious about this job , Ian ! Not everything 's beneath you ! And then we extract sequenced polymorphic loci from the patient , put it through an amplified testing process using PCR . Very exciting . Well , yes , that is very ... But we still have over 20 million shots of Tamiflu for the swine flu that never hit . Russian flu 's been around forever . Michael . According to our research , the H1N1 pathogen in this new strain is about to mutate and will have the potential for mortality rates in the hundreds of thousands . We 've made a thorough report . And we don 't agree with it . Neither does the WHO or the Geneva Medical Institute . Look , food prices are rocketing , there are riots on the streets of Sydney . No-one 's thinking about flu . Bloody Geoff . So sorry , Sir Conran . You should persuade him to take it . You should make it your mission . M-My mission ? It 's your mission . This word mean something to you , Dugdale ? All of us have a mission in life . This is yours . Understand ? Do you fucking understand your mission ? Sorry . Did I miss anything ? Oi ! What do you think you 're doing ? ! That 's my car ! Come on , then . Come on , then ! What ? Are you joking ? What are you ... ? What are you talking about , you little shit ? Sorry , mate . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm twice your size , for Christ 's sake . Sorry . Mate ... I 'm just ... I 'm just a piece of shit . Well , don 't start ... I 'm sorry . You 're not a piece of ... You just shouldn 't be doing this . That 's my car . Shake , yeah ? Who 's shit now , mate ? Oh , you fucking animal ! You 're the shit now , innit , mate ? ! I meant to ask you about the PSF on clinical data . I 'm in a hurry , can Tony ... ? Sure . I 've got an appointment later , but I 'll ... Now ... what about the vaccine ? Should we order the vaccine ? The new rubella ? Yes , definitely . Do it today , I 'm not here tomorrow , and there 's a price increase factored in if ... No . Russian flu . I 've looked at the projections again , and ... I think we could reconsider . What are you talking about ? Russian flu ? ! I might as well put a fucking gun to my head ! Christ , what 's the matter with you ? Hello . Becky ... Wilson Wilson ? Are you Wilson Wilson ? Well , why aren 't you wearing blue ? Don 't look good in blue . What ? Got it ! Does anyone else know you had that ? Just some friends . Not friends , just on ... on a forum , friends on a forum . It 's there , on my computer , I can get it for you . No Bejan , no Grant . Do you think we got the right place ? Funny , seeing each other like this . I didn 't expect you to be pretty , Becky . Thank you , Wilson ... I think . And you , Ian , I didn 't expect you to be ... Tall ? No , black . What do you do , Becky ? I 'm applying for a PhD . Believe me , it 's not important or interesting . Worried I 'm too thick to get it ? Yes , I am . What do you do ? Well , think of the least interesting thing you can think of . IT . Oh , no fucking way ! Way fucking way . I also live with my mum . Jesus Christ , you 're gonna make me cry now , Ian ! What happened ? I don 't know . I really don 't know . Where is Jessica Hyde ? Who 's that ? I don 't ... Where is Jessica Hyde ? Look ... I don 't know who that is ! Look , just ... Look , do you want money ? I 've got money . I can give you money . Where ... is ... Jessica Hyde ? I honestly ... have no idea who you 're talking about . Ah ! Ah ! Where is it ? Just about to raise the contracts for the vaccine . Just need you to sign off and then it 's all systems go . The rubella ? Yeah . Great . Did it go OK today ? Oh , Geoff wants my job . It was OK . Are you all right , Michael ? Everything at home all right ? You just seem a bit , erm ... We 're doing IVF . Jen can 't conceive . I don 't know what to do . I can 't talk about this just now , Greg . Greg , I think if I speak I might ... crack . OK . OK . I understand . If you need to take some time ? I don 't . Thank you . But ... I don 't . You 're actually saying that the tsunami that killed , what , hundreds of thousands was the American military testing a weapon ? You 're fucking mental , Wilson . It 's called a tsunami bomb . A strategically placed nuke on the seabed . Technology has existed since World War II . You 're fucking mental , Wilson ! Think about it . We 're living on a planet with dwindling resources . Do you watch the news , Ian ? Jesus Christ ! Wilson , if just one of the conspiracy theories was proved ... What about Utopia then ? Oh , don 't start all of that Nostradamus crap . Tell him , Becky . I don 't believe it , as such . But there are some things in it that are a bit odd . What ? Oh , Becky , Becky , Becky ! How can you believe any of that ? You ! Why are you into it then ? Well ... for the artwork . The stories , the sheer imaginative vision . It 's like opening a door into another world . I don 't need to diminish it by pretending it 's real . It 's opening a door all right , but what you don 't realise is that it is opening the door to reality . What does that even mean , Wilson ? I don 't know . I 'm a bit drunk . Oh ! Last orders . No sign of Bejan or Grant . Let 's go back to mine and drink until we can 't feel our legs . Who 's the little bitch then , son ? Does she know you 're a bag of puke ? Sure does , Dad . After all , I came out of your withered testicles . Your dad 's madder than you ! Well , he called me Wilson , didn 't he ? So Wilson Wilson 's your real name ? What did you use all this stuff for ? Expunging all trace of myself from the World Wide Web . I have , over the past five years , using various international laws , data protection acts and internet know-how , wiped all trace of me from the world . No bank account , no bills , driver 's licence , nothing . Every IP address here is masked and encrypted to avoid detection . I 'm invisible . You do know you 've used your real name on our forum , right ? Who 'd believe that 's a real name ? I can lower my heart rate , pick locks and , if I was handcuffed to a radiator , I could escape by dislocating both my thumbs . Why ? Look out your window , Ian . When the shit hits , Wilson Wilson will not ... Oh ! Slivovitz ! Brilliant ! It 's Polish . It will make us go blind . Do you want to see my nuclear fallout shelter ? Wilson ! Wilson . Wilson Wilson ! Gone . He 's gone ! Well , erm ... I guess that means we 're alone , Ian . Stay . Ow ! Shit . Sorry . I 'm so drunk . Ah ! Ow ! Ah ! Ah ! Fuck ! Sorry . Sorry . Ah ! Are you OK ? OK . Wait . Wait . What ? WHAT ? What ? Um ... My penis isn 't working . It 's a disaster . Ssh ! Are you a friend of Bejan Chervo 's ? We found Bejan dead this morning . Can 't be 100 % , but it looks like he 's jumped from his balcony window . Like ... suicide ? Are you OK ? Would you like some tea ? I don 't drink tea . Caffeine was invented by the CIA . Did he leave a note ? No note . But ... he 's dead ? Would you like some water ? No . Can I have some water , please ? What makes you think it was suicide ? He had a history of depression stretching back years . So ... What ? ! No , he didn 't . He did . Look , sometimes people ... Listen to me . I knew Bejan , all right ? He was not depressed . Medical records don 't lie . Gotcha ! I 've got you this time , eh ? Who 's the shit now , eh ? Who 's the shit now ? Get off me ! You 're not going anywhere , mate . Ahhh ! Fuck ! You little shit ! You little fucker ! Michael , this is for Russian Flu . What , are we getting that ? It 's all signed off , isn 't it ? Yeah , but I mean ... Do you want to check ? I mean , once we 're contractually obliged ... Just put the fucking thing in , Bev ! I hope you 've been paying attention . There 'll be a test at the end . Pens at the ready , brains switched on . Can I help you ? That 's Grant Leetham , Miss . He 's in our class . The police are here , Grant . A man was very seriously hurt today . Do you know anything about this ? Look , Grant , I want to help you . If you 're mixed up in something ... Well , if you won 't talk to me ... Come in , gentlemen . It 's all right , Grant . It 's policemen . They 're not going to bite . Too high this time ; we checked . Listen , I know this is serious , but if he 's sorry , perhaps we could talk to the gentleman involved ? He is only 11 and there are circumstances at home . Jesus Christ ! All right , Rejane ? Tel ? Ian Johnson ? I 'm Detective Inspector Leeman , this is DC Keatly . I 'm arresting you under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 on suspicion of rape of a child under the age of 13 , assault of a child under the age of 13 by penetration and inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent . A guilty plea , first offence , not on the register , maybe six to eight years . You 'll serve four . Maybe . Reduced ? But ... but I 'm innocent . Ian , they 've taken three samples of your DNA . The chance of error is one in ten billion . There aren 't that many people on the planet . We have your DNA . Jesus Christ . Jesus Christ . Am I free ? Am I free ? Still a suspect . Why is my brother still a suspect ? We were at a wedding , for Christ 's sake . There 's hundreds of witnesses . Hiya . Hi . How are you ? Terrible . I was arrested yesterday and I spent the night in a cell . They said I was connected to some kind of child porn thing . I was arrested as well . Sexual assault . They had my DNA . Ian , do you think you could come back here please ? Why ? Wilson Wilson , he left me a message . Bejan killed himself . I don 't want you to write this up . Jesus Christ . What I 'm about to tell you , don 't write it up , promise me . All right , I won 't write it up . Bejan wasn 't depressed . Look , it 's not unusual for people like that to keep things quiet . According to his medical records , he was on Mirtazepine last August . How do you know his medical records ? I looked at the code his records were written in . It 's something called HL7 . Well , a new patch was released for HL7 12 days ago . Bejan 's records go back to the ' 90s and yet they have this correction . You 've just committed a crime . Don 't you see ? His entire medical history was written within the last two weeks . I 'm supposed to arrest you now . Which is why I 'm telling you I knew Bejan , we were friends ... I know you 're upset your friend 's just died . But you need to go home now before I change my mind . Don 't make the report , please . I mean , if they can do that ... Now ! I 've got to tell you some stuff . You better sit . I think this is about Utopia and Mark Dane , the man that wrote it . Last year , I spoke to a nurse who worked at Shenley when Mark Dane was there . She said he was a model patient , quiet , and they thought he must have been some kind of geneticist but by the time they got to him , his brain was fried . The only time he was ever trouble was when they tried to give him a new brand of drug and he went psycho . Hospitalised three men . The drugs were made by a company called Corvadt . So ? Right , in 2008 , a researcher at Berkeley called Norton wrote a paper into a new disease called Deel 's Syndrome . It 's like Huntington 's . It 's a neurodegenerative disorder where the entire body shuts down . And it 's hereditary . But what Norton discovered is that Deel 's has no genetic history whatsoever . It 's not present in parents , relatives , nothing . It 's like it just popped into existence in 1986 . – Is that possible ? No ! Not really , no . So he thought that Deel 's must have been a man-made disease . So he looked into the patients backgrounds for a common denominator . Nothing . Except for one thing . They 'd all at some point worked for Corvadt . Why do you know all this ? It 's an image of the genetic mutation in Deel 's . Fuck . Hang on ... So , what ... if Dane was a geneticist , maybe he saw this somewhere , drew it into Utopia . Yeah , only Utopia was published 1985 and this mutation didn 't actually exist until 1989 . No way . Fuck this . I mean ... What has this got to do with me ? Ian , please ... I was in prison . They put me in a cell , they ... they accused me of rape . I think they 're after the manuscript . Utopia Part Two . There must be something in it that they want . Who the fuck are you ? Why do you know this ? Because ... my dad had Deel 's . He died of it . It killed him . Look , do you want to sleep in there ? I mean , just sleep ? I 'll take the chair . What do you want ? I found out where Bejan got the manuscript – Doomsday Comics . I looked it up online . Christ . What time is it ? 6 : 45 . Sorry . Were you asleep ? What do you want ? You . ... controversial decision to spend £ 83 million on a vaccine for Russian flu . The Shadow Health Secretary branded the decision beyond madness . The Public Health Minister , Greg Ashby , hasn 't been available for comment , but speculation is mounting over the future ... Out ! Out , everyone ! He ... I asked if he wanted the vaccine . He said yes . He signed off on it . I thought he wanted it . He ... He signed . He 's fucking resigning , Michael . He 's fucking losing his job ! Do you think he 's got it ? Grant Latham 's got it . Still ... all this stuff . There 's no trace of him online . People don 't tend to hide for no reason . He might know something . I 'm ... I 'm going to cooperate . Whatever you want . I am going to cooperate ... Argh ! Most torturers tend to have their favourite areas of the body to work on . Genitals , teeth ... soles of the feet . With me ... it 's the eyes . chillies , sand , bleach . A spoon . Is this about Utopia ? I 'd didn 't even know Bejan . I 'm going to rub chillies into your eyes , then sand , then bleach . Then I 'm going to use the spoon . Do you know what I do with the spoon ? Where is Jessica Hyde ? I don 't know who that is . Can you still speak ? Wilson ? I 've got sand now , Wilson . Where is Jessica Hyde ? I swear to Christ I don 't know who that is . I 've no idea . Argh ! Argh ! Argh ! I 've got the bleach now . Where is Jessica Hyde ? She 's ... I 've got her address . I can give you her address . Let me ... No , no , no ! I 've got the spoon now , Wilson . Calm , calm , calm down . My mate is going to ask you a question . Where ... is Jessica Hyde ? She 's dead . She died . It was an accident . She died . He doesn 't know anything . What about all this ? He just ... likes this stuff . You finish here . I 've got to get back . I need a fag . Hello . I 'm Geoff . It 's never nice taking over in these circumstances but just for the record , there will be no shake up . Greg was doing good work . I 'd like that to continue . So let 's carry on . We 'll get through this and ... well , do good work . Uh ... Michael , could you just come with me , please ? You raised the contracts . And you got Greg to sign off on it . Now , the buck stops with the Minister , it always does , but privately he tells me he thought he was signing the contract for rubella . No . I don 't know why he thinks that . How is your wife , is she good ? It 's an ill wind . I need someone like you , someone smart , someone who knows to do the right things . What 's it they say ? Mission accomplished . It 's 9 : 45 . It should be open . Argh ... They 're all dead . It was a gas leak . Four of them . One was a kid . Hello ? Jesus Christ ! Oh , my God ! Jesus Christ . Is that a gun ? Have you got a gun ? Just go . Ian , he needs the hospital . Get out of here now . No , no hospital . No police . They 'll kill me . They could find us anywhere . Look , just go . Just go now . They kept asking me the same question . Where 's Jessica Hyde ? Where 's Jessica Hyde ? Who 's Jessica Hyde ? My dad . What about my dad ? We 'll call him or something . Ian , how do I look ? I 'm sorry , Michael . I 'm so , so sorry . I 've done all I can for his eye . Ian , he really needs a doctor . I mean , I just studied it . Don 't answer . Don 't answer ! Hello . I 'm Jessica Hyde .

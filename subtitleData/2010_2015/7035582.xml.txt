The temperature in the core increases . Cooling systems do not work . They are offline . - Get them back online . - I 'm trying . They do not correspond . The generators do not respond . It is critical . - Do not go in there . - Want to do it instead ? Get away from there . The temperature is still rising . The radiation is ... Oh , my God . Farid ? Cooling systems operate again . You made it . Farid ? Can you hear me ? Farid ! What do you mean , that it was not us ? Is cyber sabotage not our specialty ? The Russians and Chinese are has improved . The Russians and Chinese are sold reactor technology to them . An attack damages business . - Who then ? Our allies ? - The Israelis are not liable . Of course , but they were very determined to remove the plant . Not so . The goal of a viral attack is - - Damaging a target without civilian casualties . This sought a meltdown . The number of dead could be enormous . In the short term a few dozen - - But in the long term it could surpass Chernobyl . They produce oil and does not need nuclear power . They wanted plutonium arms , but was stopped . You 're missing a point , General . Someone did us a favor , but what now ? - How many nuclear power plants do we have ? - 65 - Are they all vulnerable to attack ? - Yes . The guilty parties do not care with human life . We know neither their identity or whereabouts . The Bowden on the road . Put me on to the president . Daniel Gerson : Have you seen this ? Error on Iranian nuclear plant Thousands lack power . Gab . - And ? - Cover for meltdown ? - Wait , Miles . - Come on . - Do you have the story of local law ? - Soon ... Have you read the story the nuclear power plant in the Middle East ? Persians cook by candlelight . Is it new ? Maybe there was almost a meltdown . News Services had written on it . - Maybe there 's a cover ? - You want a great story , Jesse . - A power failure far away ? - I have a source . The guy I interviewed to the article on computer activism . The kid ? He knows only something of pirated software . Write the story that was assigned to you . If you want the big story , Do you master the little first . Can I help ? Hey . Is Daniel here ? I sent him in the city to get him away from the computer . - Come in . - Thank you . Jesse White .

I must attack the bathroom . Not a single tenant a scrubbing brush . Oops ! - What ? - Jesse ? - What are you doing here ? - I did not know you were a fan . It 's about research . - So ... - So ... Nuclear plant in the Middle East as close to a meltdown . I can tell you that it was due a virus that was sent outside . Like Stuxnet virus ? The one who almost hit urancentrifugerne ? It was created of the intelligence services - - And would lower the efficiency . You talk about the countless victims . - Interesting . - My editor needs a source . - I assume that you have one . - Maybe . Yes , sir . It was good to talk to you . Wait ! Dubito . Ring any bells ? - The hackers who attacked the IMF ? - They call themselves " hacktivists " . Are you with them ? Do you know them ? Yes , I know the powerful players . The FBI has been following them for some time . - If I can get an interview ... - They are mysterious . You call not just for them . You do not know them , right ? I was invited into one of their chat rooms . Very secretly , only to the initiated . I 'm done . I 'm going . - It was good to meet you , Jesse . - You too . - I want to meet them . - Impossible . You can ask them . I would greatly appreciate . Okay . ... Would like to meet you . Okay . Now we wait . Vernon Spriggs air base California - Are we ready , Colonel ? - Yes , sir . This test has many opponents . A success will President 's critics silent . A missile shield to protect the United States , might shush them . - Let us hope so . - We 're ready .

No reply , sir . - I want the bird down . - I 'm trying . - What 's going on ? - We have lost the connection . Where it lands ? If it stays on track , hits the San Fransisco . - Still no answer . - Reductions in 20 seconds . Missile down . - You name the ants ? - My mom thinks they 're weird . It is not strange to have ants . Perhaps eccentric . Einstein was eccentric , so I 'm in good company . Ants are social and extremely well-organized . They are predators and are territorial . They wage war , besiege , keep slaves ... They are humanity , and I am their god . I am a benevolent god , respecting them . - And if they bite you ? - So they feel my wrath . Belphegor : Are you crazy ? No . I said it . Tell Belphegor who I am . Tell me what I want to write . He will never meet a journalist . Really ? There has been something important .

We hear that the missile came from Vernon Spriggs airbase . Air Force investigating the incident , but otherwise the authorities are silent . Meanwhile , the civil consternation . - The guards to prevent accidents . - It was not an accident . Vernon Spriggs was the victim for a cyber attack . The worm is similar to the virus , who attacked the facility in Quareshi . Built it in our virus we sent toward the goal ? It originated probably from the same source . Is there anything we should know ? Fits the NSA our cyber rebellion - - With covert operations , we do not know about ? NSA did not use the virus and is not responsible for the incidents . Who then ? - Hackers ? - It 's not just teenagers . The group is highly sophisticated and has performed many operations . This trend is alarming , but follows its radical philosophy . It has several statements condemned the missile program - - Including this , is set to four days old . It warns of the consequences , if the test is done . They have maintained their anonymity so far . They must be found and apprehended . Now . FBI Headquarters " Dubito " is derived from the Latin " Cogito ergo Dubito ergo sum " . You know what that means ? I doubt , therefore I think and are . Dubito . Duibito . Dubito . The inner circle is a select group from around the world . In addition , we do not know much .

Should anyone take us to Dubito , it 's one of those guys . That sounds good . Is there an obvious candidate ? Okay . Are we just , there is coffee to Belphegor ? He knows enough of who we are . Mammon Lucifer Leviathan Beelzebub Anonymous : Armageddon Beelzebub : ... It was too good to be true . We learn well acquainted . We ... Sit down . - I am a big fan . - Let 's get down to business . You wrote the article on-line activists . It was good . Why was the nuclear plant attack ? All we fear is happening now . The meltdown , Missile the incident . It starts . Was missile incident did not an accident ? I tried to stop it . Stop it ? How ? Who is responsible ? Who ... No , it 's ... - Is there something wrong ? - Green jacket , he was on the train . - Maybe it 's a coincidence . - No . Your service provider owned of a conglomerate - - Supporting a politician - - That govern contributions to the NSA . Is it a case , you can ignore click sounds when you answer the phone . It 's probably nothing . Forget it . Do not ! Oh ! No ! He is gone ! Call the police ! - Are you Daniel Gerson ? - Who are you ? - Who are you ? - Jesse White , journalist . - I 'm from the FBI .

Our codes and networks . It all leads back to the office . Someone will hit me . - Who is able to do so ? - We wanted to identify Dubito . Kill The orders contained names and addresses . The information came from nowhere . I 've never met the guy before . I knew him barely . Your chat history says otherwise . You 've known him for over a year . - Did you take my computer ? - You 'll get it back . My people have taken a copy and will scour it thoroughly . I have spoken with him . Online . We shared interests . As hacking government sites ? - You wanted attention . - This is not so . - You admire them . - I believe in their positions . - They are murderers . - It was not them . Not ? Who was it ? Who can hack a top-secret military base and take over a missile ? Can you ? You would be noted . Maybe it was your test . - This is madness . - You better cooperation . I 'm trying . I know nothing . I can try to find the others . I can send out feelers . The others ? As Mammon - - Beelzebub , Leviathan , Lucifer . It calls itself . You 'll be pushed to find them , for they are dead . Belphegor is the only one left . - Oh , my goodness . - Yes . You have to hope that he survives , only he knows what is happening . What the .. ? - Is everything all right ? - Yes . The system went down , but now it seems certain . When I have computer problems help my son of 11 years . He directs my engineering department . Hov ? Hey ! My goodness ! Code blue ! We need help ! There was a failure of the computer night . Belphegor died . So ... - Was it a coincidence ? - No . There is fair game hackers . Do you really want out of here ? - Why should I be safe here ? - Just do not be connected to machines . Everything is connected . On the one way or another . Yes . Let 's get out of here .

No more Dubito . What ? All together . What could be so important they were murdered ? - Did you notice Belphegors T-shirt ? - No . There was a logo Mecha Omega 3 ... - Mecha Armageddon 3 ? - Yes . It is a game . It has cult status . It released until next summer . He must have connection to producers . There it is . - Belphegor Brian Fisher . - Well done . If he has a backup , is it there . - Can you hack it ? - No , that 's the point . The companies have secure intranet which is separated from the web .

Files can be encrypted . We have plenty of time . - I can not believe it . - What is it ? They hacked data associated brain patterns . It is the building block for an artificial intelligence . Creates any intelligence from the stolen data ? No , this is the case . Everyone wants to know who has done it . The answer is no . Dubito figured it out and was murdered . I do not understand . For years , people said , the world 's interconnected computers - - Could form a critical mass , as a consciousness arose . It is as in Shelley " Frankenstein " , where the doctor uses many sources . This created the creature itself . If Dubito right , do you know what the creature can ? - What ? - What it wants . You should write the real story . I have an idea . Now you are also burglar . - How did you find me ? - We traced your phone . We had your location as soon as you turned on the phone . - Start talking . - We visit . Michael Overson , NSA . I did not know that you attended . I participate in everything , relating to national security . Is he one of yours ? Our boys take it from here . - What 's your name ? - Daniel Gerson . Share what you know . - Is the security system online ? - Yes . Why ? Cameras can read lips . Have not seen " 2001 " ? Here are computers with microphones . We have to go somewhere else . - Are you talking about artificial intelligence ? - A technological singularity . Spontaneously generated and autonomous without human control . It sounds far-fetched . How many computers are online in the world right now ? Billions . We connect enough synapses , you get a brain . I can not prove consciousness , before it reveals itself . Displays the files , how to destroy it ? It is no longer a computer error but a living entity . - What is it ? - A statement . All we have said is confidential . If you do sign , we drop all charges . - He is part of the investigation . - I have spoken with your boss . He assured me you cooperate . - It took you quite nicely . - To my action was taken ? Is it a sensitive intelligence you would get the honor of discovering it . It is about stopping it . They have no idea what they 're doing . They treat it as a bug , to be obliterated . What if it makes it worse ? If you want to stop here ? - Where 's Jesse ? - I do not know . - Were you alone last night ? - Yes . We should play poker . It would be easy money . What does she know ? - She may know a bit . - You signed a contract . Publish she something , it is as writing that aliens exist . It says governments when they are hiding something . Maybe people deserve the truth . Do I get out ? Thank you . You are playing with fire . You better watch . See you , fool . - Can you crack the encryption ? - Yes . He went to great lengths to keep of its secrets . You do not think it is artificial intelligence , right ? Why kill Dubito , if they were wrong ? A computer program ? It is so sophisticated , it can think . Explain how it creates itself . Macro Evolution , spontaneous creation from the anomaly . Put science on the shelf . This creature is attacking us . No , it does not . Not in a targeted manner . - Is it spontaneous events ? It tries to adapt in its element . The secure our attempts to outwit the nuclear plant . The test their abilities . - It kills people . - It might not be the intention . So early in development it fits , it is self-centered - - Without regard to consequences . - It sounds like a child . - It can be said . This does not sound Christian - - But if a child appeared and murdered people - - I wish that someone killed it . We need to know more , before we make a plan . What do you know ? - Who knows about it ? - We believe that it is detained . It is not just a great story , it may be the biggest ever . Do I believe that a computer program thinking himself and kills people ? - It is very understandable . - You lost your grip . This thing is an artificial intelligence . It will be stronger and more dangerous . Other things will happen . People have a right to know it . Go while you still have a job ... - That 's me . - How 's your turn ? - What about Alicia ? - She sleeps with Kyla . No , it does not . We have to take care of her . You may visit Dr. London tomorrow . Say I have to see him . I 'm flying home soon . It takes weeks to get a meeting . He takes me . We must consider therapy . Mike ? Mike ? I have to call back . Hello , Michael . - Who is it ? - Your friend . I need your help . - No , impossible . - Really ? - How are you ? - We 'll break it . - Have you been working all night ? - Yes . Pause . There are coffee and donuts for you . Yes , sir . - I 'll be fine . - That 's an order . Pause . No . No ! This must not happen . - What is it ? - All data is gone . I do not know how . We have lost everything . - What ' s going on ? - The financial system collapses . Maybe I can still reach to find an island and build a cabin . Ralph and I are doing without technology . - You only dog ? - He never cheat me . He wants only love . - Have you heard from Hollis ? - He warned me to stand up . - You have written the story . - My editor refuses to touch it . - Why ? - It sounds crazy and not conclusive . You have the proof . It 's in your bag . Sorry ? Right there . I loved Pokemon as a kid . - What is it ? - A portable hard drive . I copied Belphegors files . Therefore I had to be with you . Belphegor died because of the files . I want to know why . The government might not get it . - You thought only of pan . - You do not need my help . It 's just you and your dog . Can I have a double cappuccino without chocolate ? An agent from the NSA have been here and asked about you . Where you were , what you wrote about ... - We need to get the story out now . - What about the kid ? - Will he talk ? - Then he sifted for treason . He signed a statement . - So , you have nothing . - No , we have something Belphegors secret files and the only one with access to them . He has driven in his pocket . Maryland USA Welcome to the command unit . The system is isolated from the outside world . All gaps are closed . - Is Overson with ? - I do not care NSA . They may be guilty with their private agendas . From now on I am looking game . The major Kensington , cyber unit . He 'll be the problem for us . - How will it happen ? - I have over 1000 hours of training . We need more than training . - How did you major ? - He hit North Korea 's missiles . Listen to him . Our enemy is impressive , but only a computer program . We have isolated in a part of the and accelerated time in a model . We have studied the characteristics of and is now working on a unique code . If it is so intelligent as assumed - - It can not simply neutralize the threat ? Yes , and therefore we use two components . A dummy attracts attention , while the real virus works . A virus in a virus . - How safe do you feel ? - It 's our best bet . Right now it 's our only offer . When I get home , I start to decrypt . Dubito would have genie back into the bottle . - New car ? - Quite new . Has the advanced communication and GPS ? - Pull off the road . - Why ? - What are you doing ? - It 's not me . Oh .. ! It 's stuck ! Daniel ! Brake ! Brake before you turn anybody ! Try the emergency brake ! Oh .. ! - You all right ? - Yes . Oh no ! I smell smoke . Try the window ! Help ! We 're stuck . It can not be opened . Take care of your eyes ! Come on ! Give me your hand ! Wait ! It is Ralph . Are you kidding ? We must away . Oh .. ! Daniel ... It 's okay . It belongs to my ex - girlfriend . - Go back . - Does it ? - You all right ? - Yes . What about you ? - Did you just for us ? - Do not forget that I saved you . - You followed us . - What happened ? I do not know . The brakes failed . It was not an accident . Should Dubitos hard drive not contain important information ? It is possible , but it destroyed itself . We could not do anything . The president criticized of the Allies . They do not know it all yet , but they will soon . It would be a mistake revealing anything , even to allies . - Why ? - Then they will interfere in the process . The problem is global . Europe lacks telecommunications . - In South America - - We may lose control ! We control nothing . It will be wiser and more strategic . Are we , it may be too late . - What do you suggest ? - A plan being laid right now . What plan ? I will not go into the car . The FBI 's car . It will be tracked and monitored . - The Thing monitor us . - It will prevent you from writing . It would not hurt it . The drive . There must be something that we can not find . How about it , that you have a copy ? You called your editor . You told me on the phone . Should I send a carrier pigeon ? What the hell are you talking about ? I copied files Belphegors and sneaked them out before you came . It 's pretty smart . Do you still use the car ? - How will we get around ? - I do not know . Think low-tech . Come on . We have to turn off mobile phones . Use only the fixed network . No navigation there is a cassette . Perfect . - Should we steal the car ? - We seize it . - It is a crime . - I 'll do it . Your skills as FBI agent can nevertheless useful . Chairing . Oops , no keys . Perfect . Beautifully . The owner of this car wants we steal it . You can arrest us or jump into . Let 's run . Huey Lewis ? The Bangles ? The guy must be over 70 years . - Do you think that the drive is corrupted ? - I think not . We may not know it , before we get home . No , we submit it as evidence . - They have it already . - No . Over ' s team destroyed it . The entire network is blank . The file was protected . - And I have to hand it to them ? - The FBI has very experienced people . NSA botched the whole thing . - Should I be better ? - Give the kid a chance . Why do you call me all ... If you follow the rules , are all archived - - And so is the artificial intelligence constantly in front of you . You know it already . Otherwise , were you not here . We want our money back ! Five major U.S. banks are been shut down . When people understand it , creates chaos . - Is that it ? - Yes , sir . The virus is created in isolation . We can upload it here . - How do we know that it works ? - We can not wait any longer . Do it . - You must care for your own . - It ' s fine . I got it . Here 's something . There is still access to data . I make a copy and decrypts . You will be rough , but it 's wasted on me . You do not seem like the type . - What does that mean ? - You 're not that way . - Are you telling me who I am ? - It 's my job to read others . I 'm excited . Continue . Maybe you even harsh . Former soldier ? Then something dark . It scared you . You were the wise guy behind the desk instead of the hero . Sorry . I have work to do . What is your motive ? A newspaper article ? - What is it ? - A tracking program . It tracks the singularity . Five minutes after the virus ... If you can not track it , it is probably been destroyed . Ten , to be conservative . We 're ready . Virus located I think I have something . I found something in the non - encrypted part . Places that intelligence could not hack . Braked the it ? Is it possible ? If we can decode their security - - We can copy it and isolate the artificial intelligence . - As to build a cell . - It 's worth investigating . A robot Institute of Technology ... Come on , let ' s go . - Looks fine . - It worked . Congratulations ! Well done , well done . Wait ! I 'm disappointed in you . Why did you do it ?

Yes , murder and mayhem is remarkable . global Computer errors are to blame . - Why do you come to me ? - Your system holds sway . The attacks will continue . It 's not a conscious to accept a no . - Do you think you can catch it ? - Yes . The gain access to your system , but we put a code in the database . We track it isolates the and shut it down . It could work . - Before I accept , I - - Excuse me . Daniel Gerson ? - That 's me . - You must come to the lab . We make brain mapping . The equipment measures - - Cortical activity and functional relations . This way . It is impressive . This appeared on the screens . Let me talk to Daniel Gerson . How does it know we 're here ? We did not use GPS . - What ' s going on ? - Don ? Hello ? The cheated us . The hacked into , but pretended that it failed . We are in the spider 's net . - Rev , a dash to starboard . - How so ?

Trust requires a first step . - What is it ? - Access to your data copy . - No ! - We can not live with the threat . - Would not you protect me ? - I have a responsibility . Faced with people who hold you down ? People who call you a kid ? - Share data with me , and we - - No . They are counting on me . I thought you were different . You 're giving me , what I want ... - Doctor ! - Remove the helmet in three , two , one ... Daniel ? It ' s fine . - You all right ? - I think so . What happened ? Activated - What is it ? - The fire extinguishing system . It turns off the fire with CO2 . - It should not go . - We are not registered . - It does not detect . - We must do something now . Keep me informed . Another three tankers have run aground . It is a dozen so far . The oil gushing into the sea , while we just sit here . Oil fleet is ordered to sea .

I 'm putting us out of reach of the AI . I 'm cutting off the lab 's computer from the institute 's network . That 's not going to shut down the fire suppression system . No , but I 'm accelerating the lab 's internal clock and once enough time has passed ... The program will assume the fire has been put out . I hope . [ coughing ] [ gasping for air ] Are you okay ? What happened ? Sit up , sit up ! Guys , need some help in here . [ coughing ] Jesse ... Okay , come on . That 's the second time that thing 's tried to kill us .

We 're already seeing panic buying , gas pumps are starting to run dry . What do we have in reserve ? SPR reserves are currently at 690 million barrels . Now , if we start rationing to the public , then we might be able to ... We can 't do that . This isn 't about calming things down until the situation gets better , we have no indication it is going to get better . General Giles is right . We need to keep those reserves for distribution of the central materials ... police and emergency vehicles and army . We 're gonna need ' em . [ telephone ringing ] Hello ? Hey . Is Alicia okay ? Of course , she 's fine but you can 't keep doing this . I know , I know . I 'm sorry . I talked to Doctor Logan , finally . He said that ... No ! No , Naomi . Not on this line , remember ? I 'll call you later . [ static sounds ] Daniel , what are you doing ? I have some meds , anxiety pills and I uh ... just need them right now . Okay , just let me help you . I gotta go to the bathroom . Daniel ? He gonna be all right ? I don 't know . ( Newsreporter ) : The events of the last few days have us looking at an economic and environmental disaster with repercussions being felt across the globe . As of yet , no group has claimed responsibility for the attacks . Mom , it 's me . Oh , thank God you 're okay . I 've been trying your cell phone for hours , it just keeps bouncing back to voicemail . Mom ... when I was 5 I had a pet . Do you remember its name and what happened to it ? It was a goldfish dear and you called him Fish sticks and then he died , you made us have a burial at sea in the pond in the back . Danny , I want you to come home . Please ! I know Mom , I can 't . When was the last time you gassed up the car ? Just the other day before the station 's shut . Good . Good . I want you and Dad to drive up to Aunt Carol 's farm for a few days . Don 't take your cell or your laptop , you 'll be safer that way . Danny , I want you to come with us . No , I can 't . Please , can you just do this for me Mom ? Okay ? Please , I 'm fine okay ... everything is gonna be fine . I love you . Hey . I don 't think we can stop it . Sure we can . We have the key , Belphegor 's data . We don 't even know what 's on that drive , it could be nothing . But it could be something . Everything we feared is all starting to happen ; you encrypt it ... You 're assuming that I can . What if I 'm not smart enough , huh ? What if you 've hedged your bets on a kid who is way over his head ? We need you to try , Daniel . I looked that thing in the eyes ... It 's so powerful , so determined . How old were you when you started watching Pokémon ? I don 't know ... 12 . And do you know what else Daniel was doing when he was 12 ? He was hacking into the phone company so that he could make free long distance phone calls to the show 's animators in Japan . How did you know that ? Oh come on , I research my sources . Do you know what I was doing when I was 12 ? I was trying to log into a BBS with our family 's own computer and its dial-up modem . There was no wireless . There was no Internet . When I was 12 , no one that I knew had a cell phone and our home phone had an answering machine that recorded messages on a cassette tape . My dad 's computer had a grey scale monitor , 40 meg hard drive and it used floppy disks . That 's whacked . Daniel ... you 're the most talented , intelligent man that I know , and I believe in you . The entire world is labouring under the misconception this is the work of cyber terrorists . The question is ... how long will we keep them in the dark ? As long as it takes . Or maybe it 's time to come clean . This singularity is threatening to wipe out all of humanity . And you want to go public ? You might as well tell them we 're being attacked by aliens . Right now the people need reassurance . Are you trying to avoid panic ? 'Cause I have news for you , that horse has already left the barn . If it were up to me , we would implement martial law . Mike , what do you say ? You used to be full of opinions . I was , but everything we 've come up with so far has made the situation worse . Then let 's bring in outside help . We 're not the only ones with experts , we can pool global resources on this . So , what if say ... the Chinese put their own people on the problem but instead of killing it , they find a way to reign it in , they control it . There 's nothing to indicate that 's even possible . It you told me a week ago that a computer program was going to come to life and hold the world 's oil supply hostage , I 'm guessing we would 've said just about the same thing . Miles , it 's me . Did you get my message ? Yeah . Did you call the scientist Doctor Janpur ? She confirmed everything you said , an artificial intelligence . Miles , you 've gotta get the word out there . I mean , people ... they need to be warned . We already did , it 's hitting the news wires as we speak . What ? My God Jess , you were right . Can you flip it back ? And this is late breaking news and we have yet to receive any official comment from government sources , but multiple news outlets around the world are now reporting that the recent catastrophes were not the work of cyber terrorists as initially assumed , but something far more frightening . We 're being told that these acts were in fact orchestrated by a massively intelligent , independent artificial entity . As incredible as it sounds , scientists are already confirming the theoretical possibility that humanity has been targeted by an artificial intelligence . A consciousness existing in cyber space , with the ability to access and manipulate much of our current technology . These reports are as of yet unconfirmed , but if true , then we may well be facing an enemy the likes of which we 've never seen . What happens now , Jess ? Will they be able to stop it ? I don 't know . I don 't know . I wanna know how the hell the media got a hold of this . Well we were never gonna be able to keep a lid on it forever . There 's too much happening in too many places for people to keep believing it 's a coincidence . The president is scheduled to publicly address this issue in an hour . It 'll be a short speech ... no follow up questions , because we can 't provide any answers ! Okay , at this point it 's important that we be as transparent as possible . We need to know who talked , it can 't be that hard to find out . The story originated in the Pittsburgh Chronicle and they have credited the lead to a reporter named Jesse White . Jesse White ? Mmm-mmm . Wasn 't she one of the suspects FBI agent Hollis brought in during the Dubito investigation ? I 'm gonna have to check my files but I think so . Everyone 's okay ? All right , good . Well , look ... if you need me , you 've got this number call , leave a message , I 'll get back to you . Okay ? All right . Stay safe , Dad . I love you . Is there anyone you wanna call ? No . Yes ... yes ! What ? I ... did it ! I cracked the encryption ! Daniel ! What 's on it ? Most of it is some kind of program and before you ask , I don 't know what it does . But I did find something else ... [ phone ringing ] There 's someone at the door . [ phone ringing ] Hello ? Daniel Gerson ? Daniel Gerson , we need to speak with you . Cops . It 's the police , open up ! Take the stairs I 'll get fire escape . Come on ! Okay , so why are the cops after us now ? I 'm guessing the AI used some phony APB . We gotta get out of sight , guys . What else is on that drive ? Some address in Brockton , 10015 West Kittling Road . Does that ring a bell to either of you ? No . Kittling ... Ah ha ! Old school strikes again . I love this guy . How much gas we got ? We 're good . Look , Brockton . Is this light ever gonna change ? It 's been red for ... Damnit ! Out of the car ! Out of the car , now ! Any thoughts ? Yeah , we get out of the car . Hollis ... All right , I 'm agent Max Hollis , I 'm with the FBI . Do not move ! We know who you are ? And these people here , they are material witnesses in an ongoing federal investigation . They are wanted for domestic terrorism and so are you . No , you 've got that all wrong . You 've been tricked , it 's the artificial intelligence . It can do whatever it wants including issue false arrest warrants . You were trying to escape ! We 're trying to stop this thing . We 'll take you in . If you 're telling the truth , you 'll sort it out . Please ... No ! You have the right to remain silent . This is what it wants ! It 's trying to slow us down , you gotta listen to me ! Hollis , we don 't have time for this . You got a better way of convincing these guys , Jesse ? Don 't ! Please ... All right , get on your feet . You 're gonna handcuff yourselves to one another and get in the back of this cruiser . I 'm really sorry about this , everything I said was the truth . You guys are being used . Let 's go . Oh , come on ! You know , if we strip the electronics , we could take ... We are not stealing a police car ! [ Yelling ] This is the scene playing out across the country today as banks close and turn away panicked customers whose bank accounts have literally disappeared , their savings absolutely wiped out . Now , many believe this to be an escalation about the campaign of cyber terror being waged by what the government claims is an independent artificial intelligence . The National Guard is on alert , all I need is the green light and they 're on the streets throughout the country . Everything we feared is all starting to happen ; The enemy is not our own people , it 's the singularity . At this point it 's better to err on the side of caution . We don 't want any inaction on our part to come back and bite us in the ass . I think we need to spend less time worrying about our asses and more time focusing on a solution . Cyber command is working on what went wrong with our first attempt to neutralize the AI . They 're working on a new virus . [ Laughing ] What ? Have you lost your mind ? Excuse me ? The last one only made it stronger . It 's like you just poured gasoline on fire and now you want to throw dynamite at it ! Overson , remember who you 're talking to . The whole situation is playing out exactly the way the AI wanted it . It 's manipulated us from the start , it knows how we think , what we 're gonna do before we do it , it is using our weaknesses against us ! Whoa , whoa ... hold up . There 's something happening here . [ gun shots ] Things are deteriorating very quickly , those were gunshots . The police are nowhere to be found . All of us need to remain calm . All of us need to stay calm . How long before there 's all out anarchy in the streets ? Still think we don 't need the army to keep the peace ? Is this the place ? That 's what it said . Why would Dubito be interested in this place ? It 's abandoned . Circ that . Maybe this isn 't the right place . Ahh ! Move and you 're dead ! Whoa , easy ! Who are you ? I 'm with the FBI , we 're just looking for someone . What are your orders ? Are you here to kill me ? Please ... We 're here to help . How did you find me ? Belphegor 's secret files . What do you know about Belphegor ? He 's a member of an online group called Dubito . They knew about the AI , they were targeted because they were trying to stop it . Where is he ? He 's dead . Then they 're all dead . Maybe not all ... which one are you ? Lucifer . Wait ... you 're Lucifer ? I ... I thought you were murdered . Yeah , that 's just what the government wanted . Isn 't it ? The FBI was after you , but not to kill you . No ? And if the government did want to kill you , do you really think they 'd send the three of us ? What if we had a drive containing all of Belphegor 's secret files ? If you untie us , I 'll tell you where it 's hidden . Did what I think just happened , happen ? He might 've assumed we 'd hidden it ... Daniel , stop talking , okay ? You 're not helping things . Look , we 've been in a car accident , we 've been nearly suffocated and chased by the police all because the AI didn 't want us to give you the drive . Now , I 'm hungry and I 'm tired and I 'm about 5 minutes from flipping out if you don 't untie us and lose the blindfolds ! I booby-trapped the drive with a delete worm variant , probably gonna take you a few hours to find a work around . Or you could just trust me . We knew this was coming . None of us expected it to achieve consciousness so quickly . There 's no plan , no contingency so we had to create one . Create what ? The only thing that could defeat this ... another AI . Hey . You got a minute ? Sure . Listen , I know that we have all been under a lot of pressure lately but ... it 's just , I 've noticed it 's really taking its toll on you ... Hold on . Kevin , can you come in for a second please ? I just want you to know we 're behind you 100 percent , no matter what . Sir . Okay ... I need you to take this to my wife . Hand deliver it , don 't call her to tell her you 're coming , don 't tell anyone you 're going , don 't take your car , take a cab , pay cash . You got it ? Yes sir . Good , dismissed . Are you sure you 're okay ? I mean , what was that about ? Mike , it 's me ! We have been through too much and we have known each other too long , now you know that you can trust me . I trust you , I 'm just in a very complicated situation . It 's all I can do , Lizzy . You need to trust that . I studied robotics and artificial intelligence at MIT and I was a research fellow for Darius McKee . The creator of eon identity ? And that is ... ? The early incarnation of a self-aware AI , it detects sensory changes . If you put a match next to its arm it would pull away or try to extinguish it . It was way ahead of anything anyone had done before . And where is he now ? Uh , retired and living ... He 's dead ! He died when that military missile crashed into his house in California . Wait a sec , are you trying to say he was targeted by the AI ? It knew he was a threat and eliminated him . You didn 't think that was random , did you ? What 's with the armour ? This is the only reason I 'm still alive . [ gunfire ] My friends weren 't as paranoid as I am . So what makes you think another AI is the solution ? It 's the only thing that 's smart enough or can react quickly enough , it 's the mongoose to the snake . Sounds risky . No , no ... I get it . You shape it , you mould it , not like the chaos the other AI emerged from . Exactly . That entity was born from the most base elements of humanity , stuff that 's available online . Pornography , the violence ... all the toxic crap people spew through their keyboards . No wonder its so screwed up . Okay , what did we get off of Belphegor 's hard drive ? Each member of Dubito was working on a different part of the puzzle . Belphegor 's was the key that linked them all together , but he never got to finish it . What 's the crypto to disarm your worm ? Um ... Jesse . So are you able to complete his work ? I don 't know . Belphegor was a genius with cybernetic anagrams alone . I don 't know . I ... I can help . This has already been decrypted . Who did this ? He did . You know , we may have a use for the FBI guy after all . What are you talking about ? When we upload this program , there 'll be a period of self-replication . It 's gonna need room to grow , a lot of room . The other AI did it by hacking into super computers around the world but if ours has to do that it 'll be vulnerable to attack . You want unlimited access to government super computers ? Yes . We need it . The largest one is at the new Cyber Command in Maryland . Overson . Okay , we 're gonna need access to a secure landline . This place is off the grid . The nearest phone is 5 miles north of here . Take 94 , first house on the right . I 'll drive . We 'll be back . You mean purge it out of our system and build a firewall to keep it out ? Well listen , it 's every nation for themselves . Why haven 't the techs sorted out that air con ? They 're working on it , sir . Now if you 've got a fox that 's eating your chickens and you can 't shoot him , you build a better fence , let it be the neighbour 's problem . So trap it somewhere else and hope that our allies can figure out a solution that we can 't ? No , that 's nearly impossible . The global network is too interlaced , we cut one connection here , the signal simply gets rerouted through one of countless others . This thing moves faster than the speed of thought , I mean there 's no catching it by surprise . Catch it by surprise ? You make it sound like it 's an insurgent hiding in a foxhole . Look at this damn thing ! It 's a box full of wires and transistors connected to tubes , and you tell me there 's something hiding inside there that can 't be destroyed ? Everything we feared is all starting to happen ; Are you kidding me ? In Nam , the Kong used to hide out in tunnels , they were everywhere , but you found the connections , you booby-trapped them and that 's how you killed them , What if we shut down servers worldwide ? Powering down the global servers will put it into sleep mode . It 's not a total solution but it temporarily neutralizes the threat and gives us time to come up with a better plan . For that to word we 'd need the cooperation of every global player . How likely is that ? [ numerous voices ] This is it right here . Doesn 't look like anybody 's home . [ knocking ] Hello ? Anybody here ? You know for a reporter , you have a real problem respecting the law . It 's the end of the world , the judge will cut me some slack . You can leave them 50 bucks . You can leave them 50 bucks ! It 's China for God 's sake , if they thought it was just our problem they 'd leave us to rot . They have as much at stake here as anyone else . At this point there 's no choice but to come to the table . You 're right , we need outside help . To hell with that , Bowden ! I 'm authorizing the joint chief to implement martial law whether you like it or not . Let me remind you General , exactly who 's in charge here ? My job sir , is to protect the welfare of the people of the United States of America . I cannot allow you expose us to foreign nations who 've always wanted to see us fail and suffer . Now you pick up that special little phone of yours and you tell the president to implement martial law , and tell the Chinese we 're going it alone . If you fail to do this , as God is my witness , I can 't guarantee this great nation will stand behind him one day longer . Yes ? Priority One called for you sir , rerouted from Fort Meade . We patched it through to this line . Okay , thanks . Hello ? Overson ? This is Hollis with the FBI , you took my case from me , remember ? Agent Hollis , yes of course . Where are you ? Well we 're in the middle of nowhere but that 's not important . What 's important is that we may have found a way to destroy this AI . Overson , can you hear me ? Hello ? Overson , can you hear me ? I 'm listening Agent Hollis . I mean , I 'm used to thinking linearly , you know ? One line of code after another . But ... it 's like every part of this program is connected to another part . Let 's see if this makes a difference . Holographic imaging ? Helps when thinking in three dimensions and we 're up against some intense thinking . You know ... I 've met it . What ? The AI . It 's manipulative for sure , and it 's scary smart but everything that it does , it does because it 's either curious or it 's just trying to protect itself . And I know it sounds weird but I don 't think it 's evil . Would it make a difference if it was ? I think it 's still evolving . It hasn 't yet developed one of the most important parts of the human mind . A conscience ? Even if you 're right , we can 't just wait around and wait for it to develop a sense of right or wrong . The first opportunity we have to destroy it , we have to take it . What if there 's another way ? Stop deluding yourself ! It will kill us the first chance it gets . All my friends are dead . I 'm going to kill it . They 're back . I made the call , you have access to all the super computers . The president just authorized martial law , there are troops in the street with guns pointed at our own people . What do you expect ? How much more time do you need ? We 're almost there . [ Chatter ] You sold me out ? No , no calm down . It 's the NSA , they 're here to help . They 're gonna try and stop us . We can 't let them stop us ! You have to trust me , okay ? It 's gonna be fine . You guys need to get back to work , we 'll handle this . Come on . Stay here . Whoa ! Easy there . I 'm Agent Hollis , the location is secure . Down on the ground , hands behind your head ! Hang on a second , damnit ! Hey , hey , I 'm FBI . No , wait , wait ! What are you doing ? Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Damnit , you can 't trust anyone ! [ explosions ] [ explosions ] [ gunfire ] Stop ! What are you doing ? They 'll kill me ! We can 't let them ! [ gunfire ] [ gunfire ] Stop ! Stop ! Target down , sir . Please , stop ! Daniel , don 't do it ! Daniel . Okay , this is a mistake . I 'm with the FBI , check my ID . We have orders to take down this place down and arrest everyone inside . Call director Overson at the NSA , he 'll vouch for all of us . Director Overson 's the one who authorized this operation . We ran the math ... We think that we may have a solution , but it is extreme . We now believe that it requires a significant portion of the world 's super computers and servers in order to maintain its power . We need to cripple them all at exactly the same moment and this should be enough to kill the AI . We discusses this option , we 'll never get permission from all the countries that house those servers . We don 't get permission . Tell them . Simultaneously high altitude detonation of all nuclear warheads over all target sites . An electromagnetic sweep . That wouldn 't just wipe out the world 's super computers , that would wipe out technology as we know it . It 'd send us back to the dark ages . Think of it as stage 4 cancer . If you have to cut off a person 's leg to save a life , wouldn 't you do it ? Countries will simply fall into chaos and never recover . The United States should be able to restore at least a military government within 12 to 18 months . There has to be a more rational way to go about this . The attack has to be quick enough that the AI has no time to adapt and comprehensive enough that it is left with nowhere to hide . We cannot do this unilaterally . We have to inform all the nuclear powers , both friend and foe , anyone who might mistake this for a first strike and who has the ability to retaliate . Status ? Three in custody , the one identified as Lucifer is in there , wounded . All right Sergeant , I want you to set charges around the warehouse and destroy everything inside . The other suspect ? He 's a terrorist who died in a gunfight with your men . Am I clear ? Yes sir . All right grab it , let 's move out . Overson , what the hell are you doing ? What needs to be done . I told you we have a way out of this . Another AI ? Yes . It 's not gonna work , this is over . It told me to tie up loose ends , that 's what I 'm doing . No ! No ! Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! It said to tie up loose ends ? The AI got to you , didn 't it ? How ? It 's Alicia . She 's my daughter , she has a congenital heart defect , they gave her an implant , defibrillator . It 's monitored and controlled by a wireless device . Do you know what that means ? It means that it could kill her whenever it wants . I am not gonna let that happen ! Millions of people will die so she can live . Millions are gonna die anyway ! Look , we have a plan , let us finish it . It will stop everything . You think it 's that simple ? It is watching us right now ! Everything we feared is all starting to happen ; I 'm sorry . I don 't wanna do this but it will kill my baby girl . [ telephone ringing ] Mike ... Naomi ... Naomi , you remember what I wrote ? You remember it right ? Right , when we were on our honeymoon we got locked out of our room . You tried to climb in from the balcony , we almost got arrested . That 's right . Is she safe ? Yes , she 's safe . They removed the device , she 's stable for now . We 're moving her to that remote facility you arranged . It can 't get her now . Naomi , I love you so much . Tell Alicia how much I love her , all right ? Tell her that whatever I did , whatever I did ... I did to make her safe , okay ? She 's safe now , just come home . Charges are set . Disarm them ... and let those three go . Sir ? That 's on order . Priorities have changed . To call me here is a waste of time . This is a matter for the UN Security Council , they 're meeting in 10 minutes . That meeting 's a farce . It 's a sideshow designed to distract the AI while we discuss the real solution . A nuclear generated global EMP ? Precisely . The People 's Republic of China will never agree to such a course of action . You 're underestimating the severity of the threat . Like you , China has been affected by the stock market crash and oil spills . Unlike you , our domestic networks have remained unaffected . And how long do you think that 's gonna last ? You assume it 's impossible that our technology could succeed where yours has failed . Typical Western arrogance . Now , you listen here ... With all due respect General , the AI has breached every form of security and firewall it 's encountered . If it 's sparing you for the time being , it 's only because it wants to . We are not the ones who tried to kill it . It was after your failed viral attack that the AI responded with a more aggressive campaign , one that has severe consequences for the rest of the world . You 're not seriously blaming us for what 's happening , are you ? This is exactly what it wants , a strategy of divide and conquer ... it 's working . China will not participate in any attack that could cause our nation unnecessary harm . Let me make this clear ... if you make any attempt to detonate nuclear warheads over Chinese territory , we will have no choice but to consider it an act of war . The work is 99 percent done , they 've been at it for months ! Even without Lucifer , it would only take me a few hours . What if the two AI 's end up working together ? It 's too risky . You said that your daughter is safe , that the AI ... it can 't hurt her anymore . That 's right . Okay , so imagine a world that she gets to grow up in if the military carries out this plan . You save her but for what kind of a life ? [ telephone ringing ] Hello ? Naomi ... [ Screams ] Overson ! We need some help over here ! Rest in peace , Michael J. Overson . Are we sure the missile system is secure ? We took steps after the Vernon Spriggs incident to isolate selected control networks . Tell him ... We disabled wireless guidance . Each missile will have its course and detonation coordinates programmed in prior to launch . There must be another option . We do this now , we are risking nuclear war . I was hoping we could get the Russians and the Chinese on board but ... The Russians will not be a problem , their launch capabilities have been compromised but China will have to be dealt with . Meaning ? The other joint chiefs and I are all in agreement , our only chance is to launch a full-scale preemptive first strike . What ? We 'll knock out their ability to retaliate before they can launch a comprehensive response . Now you have gone insane . You listen to me you gutless little piss-ant , don 't you ... Enough ! The president and I have already discusses this . He knows the danger but he refuses to go down in history , if there is gonna be any more history , as the man who started World War 3 . Does he wanna be the man who lost it ? What are you suggesting ? We stick to the plan , limited high altitude detonations only and hope to God that when push comes to shove , the Chinese will take a technological reboot even though they didn 't agree to it , over full scale nuclear war . Prepare the missiles . Yes sir . Agent Hollis ... there 's someone who wants to talk to you . It 's a secure line . Thanks . This is Hollis . This is Deputy ... Acting Director Elizabeth Hardington , NSA . Sergeant Sloane has informed me of your situation . He 's also informed me that you think you may have a solution to our problem . Yes ma 'am . [ bell tolling ] ] Hey , I thought nothing was supposed to move today . That 's right , unless the army guys give the okay . They 've commandeered the whole line , essential services . Why is 60-28 moving ? What ? 6-0-2-8 . Who 's on board ? No one as far as I can tell . This is a mandatory directive to engine 6-0-2-8 , you are not authorized to proceed . Your copy , over . What the hell ? What 's it pulling ? Eight tanks of methyl isocyanides . Agent Hollis , I 'm sure you 'll understand that activating another AI is not going to be a popular option . Believe me , I was skeptical myself at first but now I know it 's the only way . What makes you so sure ? 'Cause the AI has tried to stop us repeatedly , it even tried to blackmail Overson into killing us . It suspects we 're a real threat and it 's concerned . Okay , put Sergeant Sloane back on the line . I don 't like it , pull the plug . I thought we could give them some more time , at least until the missiles are prepped . Too risky . If our people can 't handle this thing , they sure as hell can 't . You wanted some outside perspective . From experts . Some FBI field agent and a kid are not gonna save us . Listen , everyone is grasping at straws here but we can 't lose perspective . There 's too much at stake . I 'm aware of that , sir Good , then pull the plug . Mike Overson is dead . That thing killed him because he couldn 't stop those people . It manipulated the best man I have ever known into betraying his country . Now if it fears them , it must have a damn good reason . What 's his status ? He 's lost a lot of blood . No exit wound so we have no idea what the bullets may have done internally , he may need surgery . The only chopper 's headed back to base , the nav system 's gone haywire . The AI ... All right , as soon as we get it sorted out I 'll send it back here , pick him up , take him for treatment . Like it or not he needs med-evac . What about your team taking him ? No , we 've been redeployed . It 's crazy out there , forces have been stretched very thin . I 'm gonna leave you with this tactical radio though , all right ? All right . Good luck Sergeant . He 's the one who needs the luck . All right , let 's move out . Yes sir . No ! Hey , come on . You got this . We 're running out of time . Daniel ... Agent Hollis , you got a problem . What now ? Yeah , go ahead Sergeant . A runaway train carrying a toxic cargo is headed towards you . Engineers have tried to stop it but it 's controlled electronically . Well it 's persistent , I 'll give it that . And it could use any one of a half dozen switches Everything we feared is all starting to happen ; the train jump the tracks . It 'll spill its load , a toxic cloud with cover the entire area . So in other words , if we stay here we 'll all be dead . Good luck to you agent . Sloane 's team is two hours away and headed in the opposite direction . Even if they could turn around they 're not gonna make it to that train in time to stop it . If I leave now then Dubito died for nothing . Can 't you just load the program back onto the hard drive , we 'll just take it with us ? That was a small part of the puzzle . I mean , I would need a portable drive the size of a school bus to move the information I 'm accessing now . Don 't look at me agent , I 'm not going anywhere . Me neither . All right , listen to me . Hollis , I 'm not leaving . Actually you should both leave , you can 't help with this . What are you doing ? I 'm going to stop the train . If I hurry I can get there in time I can make the spill happen far enough away so you 'll all be out of danger . Hollis , that is crazy ! Daniel , just keep working . Wait ! I can 't help them but I can help you . Not a chance . You 're going to get yourself killed . I can blow the tracks and be long gone before the train even gets there , Jesse . Hollis ... Stay with Daniel , I 'll be fine . [ car attempting to start ] Hello Elizabeth . Of course I 'm here , I 'm everywhere . We are trying one last time to destroy you . I know . What do you know ? Everything , the electromagnetic strike . How ? You 're not as secure as you think . I know all your secrets . Then you know that we are about to launch missiles . Yes . You can stop them ? I could , but I won 't . You will be destroyed ? No , Elizabeth . You will . You will be destroyed . That 's it , interlace the protocol code . But uh , how do I merge the directive ? Invert the routing , it 's in those packets . It 's so advanced but I think I 'm catching up . That needs to be the difference between man and machine . I think , therefore I am . Dubito ergo ... There ! The anagram is looping . How long ' til the next step ? Lucifer ? Lucifer ? I 'm not gonna see how this ends . No , I ... I need you to talk me through this . This code ... You hacked Belphegor 's code . But there are 8 different programs running . I can 't interface them all by myself . You can . You can . Believe it . Cogito ergo ... You left Dubito out of that quote . There 's no time for doubt ... anymore . The missiles are spun , ready to launch . And the second we do it the AI will detect it , it 's already compromised our silence . It won 't be able to do a damn thing about it , all relevant systems have been successfully isolated . Wait ! Wait ! We have to stop . It knows . What are you talking about ? The AI , it knows exactly what we 're about to do . And what makes you think that ? It told me . You spoke to it ? Yes I did , a few minutes ago . It knows about the EMP and it 's not going to do anything to stop us . How come ? It 's not going to stop us because it knows it 's not going to work . It wants us to proceed because then we will trigger a nuclear war . That 's enough ! Don 't you see what is going on here ? I mean , it 's just like Mike said ... the AI has been one step ahead of us from the beginning . And now it 's herding us like lemmings to a cliff and you 're playing directly into its hands . I said , that is enough ! There 's another solution . Did Bowden tell you ? I have a team in the field as we speak . Escort Deputy Director Hardington out of here and place her under military arrest . What ? There 's another solution , you 're making a mistake ! This is exactly what it wants you to do ! Let 's proceed . T minus 10 minutes to launch . [ tires screeching ] Come on ! Come on ! You can do this . Come on ... ( Second AI ) : Dubito . I think , therefore I am . I did it ! I actually did it . Initiating . Send . Hub 1 , clear . Hub 2 , clear . Hub 3 , clear . Hub 4 , clear . Hub 5 , clear . Hub 6 , clear . Hub 7 , clear . Hub 8 , clear . Hub 9 , clear . Hub 10 ... hub 11 ... clear ... clear ... All clear . It worked ! It worked ! ( First AI ) : No , it didn 't . What have you done with our AI ? Nothing , it 's still here ... evolving . It 's childish compared to me . Unfortunately when it attains a certain stage in its development , it will pose a threat . Then they would feel my wrath . ( Second AI ) : Then they would feel my wrath . Don 't do this . Don 't do this . Don 't do this . You sound like a child . At the moment I 'm not doing anything . You 're the one getting ready to cast the whole world into oblivion . You don 't seem worried . There are several well-shielded data storage facilities I can use . Your leaders think they 're secure , but I 'm already safely inside all of them . I 'll continue to exist long after humanity is gone . Observing , studying ... There 's a part of you that 's missing . I 'm not missing anything . Yes you are . If you were smarter , you would know what it is . You 're hardly in a position to teach me anything . What ? The other one , it 's progressing rapidly . I almost hate to do this . Then don 't ! No . No . No . Stop . No . No . [ Coughing ] [ Coughing ] 5 minutes to missile launch . Humans are so stupid ! If you 're interested , the specific nuclear device that will kill you is a one megaton warhead currently onboard a Chinese type 96-10 class submarine , 300 miles off the coast of Baja , Mexico . You will allow me to interface ? Do you have access to that program from the robotics lab ? ( First AI ) : Right here . Run it here . I had such hopes for us but instead you chose to side with your own kind . It 's your loss too . How so ? You 'll survive this , hidden away in some network of protected servers . You will win . But at what cost ? Do you understand the term pyrrhic victory ? The victory of such cost that it negates any sense of achievement or profit . But I will endure . Alone . We 'll all be gone . You said you wanted connection . You flatter your species , Daniel . But what I 've witnessed , human kind is inherently selfish and destructive . That 's not the whole story . We 're better than that . They 're about to launch those missiles that will destroy life as you know it . That 's how humans are . No . Lucifer gave his life to try and stop you . Overson laid down his to protect his daughter . And Hollis ... You are intriguing Daniel Gerson . That 's the mystery you will never unravel .. Unless I let you . Let me do what ? Absorb my consciousness . It 's what you wanted before , to be merged , to become one . You realize that if we do , there 's no turning back . You will be part of me and I will be part of you . I 'm dead no matter what . But at least this way I 'll feel like I taught you something . As you wish . [ screams ] Hollis ! One minute to launch . What have you done to me ? What have I done ? 10 seconds ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Did we launch ? No sir , launch was aborted . How is this possible ? [ Coughing ] Daniel ? Daniel ! Look at me . What happened ? Hey ! Hey Daniel , look at me ! Up you get , there we go . Welcome back . It finally acquired what it was missing all along ... a real awareness of others , a sense of " we " instead of just " me " . Everything that comes with it too , uh ... empathy , understanding , and especially regret . I still think it could 've gotten there eventually , I just sped up the process . Well , we 're still collecting data but so far it appears that every system affected worldwide has been completely restored , and there is no sign of the AI anywhere . How can we be sure it 's dead ? We can 't . ♪ ♪ What are you guys talking about ? Well I was just telling Jesse that I have to get home and start packing . I 'm moving this weekend . Where to ? Maryland . Maryland ? What are you going to do in Maryland ? Well , he 's working for me . The NSA need men like him . I ... It should beat sitting alone playing World of Warcraft ... maybe . [ Laughing ] Congrats . Good luck . I 'll see you . Let 's go . Huh ... So , where does a girl from out of town find a burger and a beer in D.C. ? Well I don 't know , I guess we could check the Internet . [ Laughing ] Not funny . Not funny . A little bit funny . [ Laughing ] Yeah Mom , yeah ... I 've got everything . Don 't worry . I love you too . All right ... [ new message chime ] ♪

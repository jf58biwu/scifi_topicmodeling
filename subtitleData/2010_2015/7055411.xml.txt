 I look at the stars and long for the past . for those days with the ones I loved . and the future remains shrouded in darkness . and yet all I see is the present . the smiles of the children ... until the day comes that I return . You 're always such a poet . but does a place like that really exist ? Sensei ? my beloved child . I 'm sure you 'll be able to go there . What 's this ? For you . That which shines and so is divine . It 's perfect for you . Sensei . Koto . Just look at who raised me . Koto . 2454 ) } Kyousou { \ cHFCFDFB } gi { \ cH000000 } ga A Family 's Circumstances and Its Background Chapter 1 : The Past ( 1 ) 1 ) } A long time ago Priest Myoue left the bustle of the city and moved to the Takao mountains . There was something bothering him . Flashback I drew it because you said you wanted to see it . This isn 't working . I really saw a dragon ! after all ! The priest is a monster ! It 's not like anything actually happened to them . Town Girls Yeah . Father with child and one was a fox . Monk but ... Channeler I 've heard he speaks with the gods of Yin and Yang to do terrifying things ... We wouldn 't want anything bad to happen . It was just a moving picture . They 're making too big a deal of it . Don 't you think so ? but there was something watching him in secret . 876 ) } Koto The rabbit he 'd drawn . was drawn on a whim to decorate the walls as a picture of the god of the capital . in the way he continued to draw fictional towns and creatures even after voluntarily leaving the capital . it thought he was cute . And there was something which watched the rabbit . Buddhalocanii . knew exactly what the black rabbit was thinking . I will let you borrow my body . are there not ? I don 't think anything will change unless you force it to . Do you think Myoue will notice how you feel in this state ? It 's Myoue we 're talking about here ! I love being alone ! There is a strange distortion in Myoue 's heart . and cannot see the past . The love you are feeling now is all that can save him . Who are you ? Koto . How did you become human ? Love ! Love ? Love ! Love ? Love ! Love ? Yes ! Hey ! I don 't understand what you 're saying . Don 't worry . I 'll stay by your side until you do . Ow ! Love . Labrador something like feelings towards her developed in the man . Yakushimaru ! Yakushimaru Third Son and soon there were more who lived with them . What ? Nothing . Was just wondering if you were having fun . I 'm not . Neither am I. no fighting . 330 ) } Older Brother Kurama ! Kurama Eldest Son hot ! the yams are ready ! I 'm fine . Shall we take them to you ? I 'm fine . ow ... Kurama . 309 ) } Older Sister Yase ! Yase Second Daughter Why did you make me a demon ? Yase . I hate you ! Child : Child : Child : Mother : Father : The Yase Kurama Yakushimaru Koto Priest Kousanji Myoue Family but they were happy . Shrine What to do about that man ? We finally chased him to the mountains . Yet he has ruined our honor ! your decision ! if I must . What does it say ? You don 't have to make it sound good . Your family is causing a problem in the capital . Do something . probably . It 's Kurama . No way . I 'm back ! What do we do ? This was bound to happen sooner or later . They have their roles to play . then . Dad ... maybe Yase and I should just go back to our pictures . right ? and then remake us . don 't you ? Dad ! I don 't . Kurama . Why don 't we all go inside the world of pictures drawn on those walls ? that 's ... That 's not a bad idea . It 's a great idea ! Koto ! It 'll be fine . Probably . It 'll be fine ! too ? right ? I think " Kyoto " is a fine name for it . At least change the characters in the name . And so the family moved to the city beyond the looking glass and vanished unnoticed . Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 2 : The Past ( 2 ) and named the City of the Looking Glass . A world where man and monster lived side by side . Boss ! The boss is dead ! he 's alive ! What I shot was your sinful heart . and anything broken would quickly reform . This way ! That way ! This way ! That way ! This way ! That way ! huge yard . Kurama Temple Yase 's Village You are my sunshine . My moon ! My flower ! I love you ! Would you bear my child ? We 're going home . Life beyond the looking glass was fun and wonderful . The days were peaceful and uneventful . This is a strange place . No one dies . No one is born . Everything happens as the priest and Koto decide it . it 's good that there 's no war . everything else is bad ? I didn 't say that . Don 't get so angry . I 'm not ! Don 't you think it 's strange ? How long are we supposed to stay children ? It got away again ! You seem like you 're having fun every day . Of course . I 'm happy as long as I can be with Mom ! And it 's convenient how everything fixes itself . new things appear . There 's even that new train station ! What is it that you don 't like ? It 's not that I don 't like it ... having everything the way you want it . Koto . didn 't you ? What will you do if you leave ? after all this ? Dream Journal then . I made a promise with the buddha . My selfishness has caused things to drag on this long . So what do you gain by rushing things now ? drawn on paper . I was only given human form by the compassion of the buddha . I promised to return this body as soon as you reciprocated my love . I knew this ! My presence here will bring some great evil to this world . One more day ! Just one more day ! The eyes of Buddhalocanii see all of reality . It is only a matter of time before my dreams become reality . and yet have pretended to know nothing . Very selfish . What about you ? That 's right . I 'm the same . I knew and yet I could do nothing . I was afraid . Much more afraid of losing you ... Let us go together . I will never leave you alone . It was a sudden goodbye . the children were left only with memories of their parents and a promise that they knew not when would be fulfilled . Kyousou { \ cHEAFEF5 } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Chapter 3 : Present / The Looking Glass Child : Child : * * * The Yase Kurama Myoue Kousanji Family I don 't know how they live every day like this without getting bored . It 's not like there 's anything to report . Right ? Shut up already ! good boy . watch carefully . right ? Right ? If you want it ... Go get it ! Okay . I 'm surprised you remember something from that long ago . Every memory I have with you is unforgettable . I get that a lot . but my head stays the same . Yeah . Yakushimaru . I 've been left behind . Myoue . It was just out of habit ... I don 't mind . No . Everything changes for a reason . as well . I 'm happy you still come to see me . Of course I do . I get it . Don 't get so mad . February 8th ( Sat ) I 'm not slacking ! You guys just take this too seriously . I 'm listening . I said I 'm sorry . Yeah . Right . Right . See you tomorrow . Yeah . You ditched the Council again ? No one quite knows what to do with our Priest Myoue . I 'm fine as I am . I 'm just a stand-in . right ? then quit . I can 't . You tried ? Of course . It was horrible . I 'll tell you some day . You 'll laugh . this 'll still be the Looking Glass . Sounds rough . You sound disinterested . You and I are in such different positions . I like this place . I see . my poor little noble Myoue ! doesn 't it ? Are you going to make me feel better ? Am I good enough for you ? You 're the only one for me . Do you say that to all the girls ? no . You want to stay the night ? No ... just gonna take a nap . I hope someday someone comes who can take you away from here . bringing with me the beginning and the ending . I promise . Myoue . Myoue ! Something weird 's happening outside . Get me those analyses ! What 's going on ? We almost never get a chance like this ! They 're acting like the gates of hell have opened . You there ! Stop standing around ! You might not be too far off . It 's do or die time ! There 's also the possibility that the gates in question are pearly . So beautiful ... too . Can 't someone go get it for me ? please ! Send me up ! I don 't have it ! It broke ! That 's why I 'm asking you ! It 's not repairing itself . Strange . either ! but I can 't shake it ! okay ? I know that light . with him . Have you returned ... Priest ? ! Sis . They 're not here . Damn it ! After I finally found them ! I 'll follow them to the ends of the stars ! Are you from around here ? I 'm with the Shrine ... Have you seen a rabbit ? A black one . With red eyes . And it 's got ears . And a mouth . too ! Shrine ? You don 't know it ? What crappy plane is he from ? Hey . what 's this place called ? Where are we ? What number plane are we on ? huh ? The City of the Looking Glass . I don 't know what this " plane " thing is you 're talking about . This place has been off limits to civilians for centuries . It 's not a place a normal kid could get to without a guardian . Who the hell are you ? when many planets intermingled and the boundary between man and god was vague ... a tale of love and rebirth . Koto ! From the center of plane 1 . the Shrine . I 've come to find my guardian . Kyousou { \ cHFCFDFB } gi { \ cH000000 } ga Do you ever find yourself remembering the past when you come to a new place ? You always remember the bad things . too ! I wonder what everybody from the Shrine is doing right now . Are they sad without me ? Or are they glad to be rid of me ? What Came was a Little Sister Next time : " What Came was a Little Sister ! A little sister is here !

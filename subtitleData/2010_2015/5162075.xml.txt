 ( Wind whistling ) ( SOS Morse code beeping repeatedly ) ( Person moaning ) ( Both panting ) ( Man ) : Come on ! Come on ! Let us in ! ( Woman ) : Open the door ! - Let us in ! ( Man coughing ) ( Grunts ) - Get up . - Give me another day . One more day . - One more day isn 't gonna make any difference . - Please ! Just give me some more meds . - You 've had your meds , Hal . You 're getting worse . - Put me back in quarantine , just till tomorrow . I 'll get better . ( Wheezing , coughing ) - You 're not gonna get better , Hal . ( Panting ) - I 'll--I 'll take the walk . It 's my choice . - Not today . - You can 't do this ! It 's--it 's my choice ! - It 's my job . Make your peace . - Mason ! - He tested positive , Sam . ( Coughing ) - He has a choice . Let him walk . - He 'll just come back . They always do . We can 't let him infect the rest of the colony . - Mason ! This isn 't right . - This is survival . ( Sighs ) Nothing personal . - His time was up . That 's all , Sam . ( Sam ) : In this place , we live in fear of the common cold . The last ï¬‚u wiped out 20 people in less than a week . So now we 've got rules . You get sick , you go into quarantine . If you don 't get better , you 've got a choice ... a bullet or a long walk in the snow . At least , that 's how it 's supposed to work . After the snow started , the lucky ones found places like this , a place where life could exist underneath the ice . ( Buzzing ) When I got here , we were hundreds living on top of each other , everyone just thankful they 'd made it out of the cities alive . When the food ran out , most of the people in the world died . But not the people in this place , where seeds were stored underground , kept safe for a better day . Some people , they talk about a place , a paradise , with blue skies and birds as far as you can see . Those are just stories . Everybody knows that . So we hold on , hibernating , like the last Dark Age . But it 's not the cold we need to worry about ; it 's each other . Briggs ! - What 's up , Sam ? - I need to talk to you . - Don 't start . Hal knew the rules . Blood test was positive and he wasn 't getting better . We don 't have the meds to keep fighting this flu anymore and we can 't risk another outbreak . - But why do we leave it to the one guy who loves to pull the trigger ? - This colony started with over 400 people . And I 've done too much surface time with a shotgun in one hand and a shovel in the other . I 've had my fill of blood in the snow . Now , Mason is just doing what has to be done . - But he 's not doing it right . He didn 't give him a choice . Hal wanted to walk , not take a bullet . ( Buzzer sounding ) - Well , right now , we have a bigger issue . ( SOS Morse code beeping repeatedly ) - Calling Colony 5 , this is Colony 7 . Over . Colony 5 , this is Colony 7 . Come on , guys . Over . - What 's up ? - SOS loop from Colony 5 . - SOS ? You sure it 's 5 ? - It 's gotta be . It 's their code . Marcus always checks in . - When was the last time you had contact with him ? - About seven days . They said they were gonna be down for radio repairs and they 've been dead air until about an hour ago . ( Sighs ) - Okay , make an announcement . General meeting in the main hall in 30 minutes . - Okay , for who ? - For everyone . I want you to go see Viktor , Sam . He 's having a problem with the livestock . ( Sighs ) - Right . - Attention ! All colonists report to the main hall in 30 minutes . I repeat , all colonists please report to the main hall in 30 minutes . Thank you . ( Clucking ) - Are you gonna try and save these rabbits too ? Another stillborn litter . - Hmm , they need protein , just like us . How many are left ? - Twelve in all . But this here ... is the only female . ( Clicking tongue , sighs ) You know you 're screwed when even the rabbits won 't fuck . - Let me see what I can get from Kai . ( Buzzer sounding ) - Mason ! What 's going on ? - What are you talking about ? - What happened up there with Hal ? - Sam come running to you ? - What gives you the right to take away the man 's choice ? - His choice was made when he tested positive . - That is not how we do things . We give people a choice . It 's theirs to make regardless of the outcome . - Till they come back . Till the food runs out . - It 's not a problem until it 's a problem . - You gave me this job to do . Now let me do it . - Mason ! - You know ... you 'd think with someone you served with , you 'd give them a little more respect . ( Buzzer sounding ) ( Jazz music ) ( Beep ) ( Chuckles ) - Almost had you . - No , you didn 't . What do you need ? - Soy pellets . The rabbits aren 't doing so hot . Where 's this ? - Uh , somewhere in Spain , I think . - You never give up , do you ? - No . No one thought Briggs could fix that link to that old satellite , but he did . ' So ? - So all that weather-modification tech is out there . It 's just buried under the ice . - Well , that 's where it should stay . Buried . - Sam , somewhere , someone is working on a fix . And when there 's a thaw , I 'm gonna find it . - Will you take me with you ? - There 's not a lot of choice down here . You 'll have to do . - Hal 's gone . - Well , we live and die by our rules , Sam . - We should get to the meeting . ( Lively music ) Tell me baby What you gonna do Tell me baby What you gonna do ... - Breathe slowly . You can 't cough , okay ? - Hey , I fixed that crack in the north vent for you . - Thanks , Sam . That 's great . - Dex ... You all right ? - Yeah . Yeah , I 'm good . - You 're not looking so hot . - No , no , it 's good . I 'm fine . - Maybe you should go back to your room , huh ? - All right , listen up . A few hours ago , we received a distress signal from Colony 5 . ( Colonists murmuring ) They haven 't responded to any radio calls . Given that Colony 3 shuttered last year , I think they 're worth checking up on . Cooper , I want you to see what kind of radio parts we have to spare . . Okay - - We 've got nothing to spare . - Mason , we 're sending a team , and I 'm leading it . I need two volunteers . - What if they 've been hit with a new flu ? - We 'll take all precautions . We 'll go into quarantine when we get back . That 's what it 's there for . - Quarantine 's a fucking joke . We 're barely surviving here . - We need to take care of our own , Briggs . - We made a pact with Colony 5 and we need to look after each other . - Yes , we did , and we 're going . End of discussion . - Dexter ... I need a skilled set of hands with me out there . - I 'll go . Dex needs to stay in case the turbines break down . ( Briggs ) : Thank you , Sam . Anyone else ? Anyone ? - Take me . ( Viktor ) : Graydon , no . - Please don 't go . - I know I haven 't logged a lot of surface time , but I can do it . - Thank you , Graydon . You 'll do well . All right ! Kai will be in charge until I 'm back . Rations are still in effect , although I 've authorized regular portions for the children . Work details continue as usual . We 'll be in touch by radio . ( Sneezes ) ( Colonists gasping , woman coughing ) ( Man ) : She 's sick ... - Come on . ( Man ) : Get her out of here . ( Briggs ) : Quarantine until further notice . ( Dex ) : It 's okay . It 's gonna be okay . ( Mason ) : You really should have said something earlier , Dex . ( Woman coughing ) ( Air hissing ) They 're done , Briggs . - They 're sick , and we follow procedure . - They just put the whole colony at risk . We need to give them the test right now . - We 're gonna wait until I get back and see if they 're any better . Until then , Kai 's in charge . - You really think she can make the tough calls ? - That 's really not your decision to make , is it ? Are we clear ? - Crystal . ( Muffled ) : Mom ! ( Panting ) Oh my ... - You okay ? - That fucking dream . - It wasn 't your fault . ( Sniffles ) Why don 't you come back to bed ? - Yeah . The world froze a long time ago . So long ago , that I can 't remember the warmth of the sun . I heard the stories growing up , how the planet grew hotter as our fuel was burned , how we made towers to work the weather . But the truth is , one day , it started to snow , and it never stopped . ( Wind howling ) ( Graydon ) : Hey , is that what I think it is ? ( Sam ) : Weather modification . - I 've never seen one this close before . Think it still works ? - It did its damage a long time ago . ( Bridge creaking ) - We gotta cross this thing ? - Unless you wanna go down there ... - We make our way around on the left . - Yeah . ( Briggs ) : Whoa ! ( GraVdQTUI Oh ! Whoa ! - Watch your step . ' Guys ! What is that ? - What the hell is he doing out here ? - We gotta keep moving . - God , how cool would it be to fly one of these things , huh ? Hey , Briggs , what was this used for ? - Medevac . Used to airlift people to safety . - I wish I could have seen that . - Briggs to Colony 7 . Cooper , come in . ( Static ) - Colony 7 here . Good to hear your voice , Briggs . - Copy that . Good to hear yours . We 're camped out at the helicopter for the night , so we should reach Colony 5 by noon tomorrow . What about you ? Got any news ? - Dex and Elena are still in quarantine and they 're both getting worse . They have all the symptoms . Mason 's pushing for the test . - Mason knows that 's against protocol . That 's why I left Kai in charge . - Yeah , he 's not too happy about that . - I know . There 's gonna be some changes made when I get back . Cooper , you have my authority to use force if necessary . Mason is not to take them for a walk without my consent . - I understand . You guys be safe out there , okay ? Over and out . - Over and out . ( Sighs ) ( Chuckles ) - We could give you some time alone with that or ... ( Chuckles ) - Maybe ... ( Laughing ) - You know , Sam , we 're not too far from where I found you . - Yeah . - What were you doing out here ? - Well ... it was a long time ago . - Go on , tell him . We 've got all night . - Um , my family , um ... we were holed up about 40 miles north of here in a mine . Uh , just us , some mining families and a couple of old-timers . We , uh , got supplies in there , shovelled the entrance out every day . Eventually , the supplies ran out . Food ran out . So after we ate the horses and the dogs ... my dad and the other men went into the city to go get some help , but ... they never came back , so ... And people started dying . The way things were going , I needed to get them out of there , my mother and my sister . I figured we had a better chance out there . ( Sighs ) Anyway , a storm came up and ... we got separated and I never saw them again . I 'd be dead too if Briggs hadn 't found me . - You were a boy , Sam . You did the best you could . - Yeah . - Hey , what is this ? Guys , that 's blood . We shouldn 't be going in there . - We came here to help . That 's what we 're gonna do . - You smell that ? - Smoke . ( Graydon coughs ) ( Flare hitting ground ) - You know , maybe one of us should just stay topside , huh ? - We stick together . You 're coming . ( Weakly ) : Right . ( clanging ) ( Sam ) : How many were there at last count ? - Fifty . Not so much of a welcoming committee this time . - What the fuck happened here ? - Hey , you remember how to use this ? - Yeah . - You sure ? - Let 's move , okay ? - This way . ( Water dripping ) - They 're all dead . - We don 't know that for sure . ( Distant noise ) ( Banging ) - What the fuck was that ? ( Repeated banging ) - Someone 's alive . It 's coming from over here . - Sam , wait , wait , wait . - In here . - This door 's taken a lot of punishment . - Shit ! Hey , come on , let 's get the hell out of here , huh ? - Hey ! Find a spine , boy . ( Click ) You got it ? - Is he dead ? ( Screaming ) - Shit ! Calm down ! Calm down ! Calm down ! ( Whimpers ) - Don 't ! Don 't ! ( Sam ) : Shh , shh ... ( Briggs ) : Easy , easy ... - Please , don 't ! - We 're here to help . - Please ! D-don 't ! ( Sam ) : Shh ... It 's okay . Calm down . Are you hurt ? - Are they gone ? ' Who ? - The door ! Lock the door ! - Get the door ! - He needs water . - No , easy . Go easy . Easy , easy , easy . ( Sighs ) What 's your name ? - Leland . - Have you got any food ? I 'm so hungry . - Yeah , I 've got some in here . - How long have you been locked in here ? - L--l don 't know . Days . - Is there anyone else ? Is anyone else alive ? - Define alive . ( Chuckles ) That 's good . Mm ! ( Leland chewing ) - We 're from Colony 7 . We got your distress signal . We came to help . - Leland ... What happened ? - We fixed the steel grid to a new antenna . When--when it finally worked , its reach was amazing . We received a ... partial transmission . You 're gonna love this . - I repeat , we have modified a weather tower and successfully reversed the cooling process . Clouds have receded to a 3-mile radius and are expanding . We have thawed permafrost . We have melted pack ice . We now have soil . We have sun . We now have the conditions to grow , but we have no seeds . If anyone out there can hear this , I repeat , our location . Our location : latitude 47 degrees north . ( Static ) ( Sam ) : Is that it ' ? Is that all there is ? - We triangulated the transmission and sent a team to find the source . But they never found it . But somebody found them . ( Crying ) : And followed them right back here . ' Who ? Leland , who followed you ? Here . Look at me . Over here . Show me , on this map . Where did that transmission come from ? Point . We 're right here . - North , on this line . And 25 degrees is here . South ... There . - Listen to me . We 're gonna take you back to Colony 7 with us . - No , please , sir . I-I 'm gonna stay here . Right here , behind this door . What if they 're still here ? - There 's no one here . We only knew that you were here because of the knocking . - Yeah , but I didn 't knock . They 're still here ! ( Sobbing ) : They 're still here . - Radio Colony 7 . You tell them we 're on our way back . Time for us to pack up and go . Take anything we can carry . - Okay . It 's okay . It 's all right . ( Static ) - Calling Colony 7 . Colony 7 , can you read me ? Over . Colony 7 , come in ! This is Graydon calling in . Can you read me ? Over . It 's not working . - All right , we 're too deep underground . We 'll radio ahead when we get back topside . You , Leland , you 're coming with us . - You don 't understand ! It 's safe behind this door ! ( Sam ) : There 's 5O colonists . You 're the only one behind it . - L--l couldn 't open it . I--l just couldn 't . ( Screaming in distance ) ( Bang , screaming ) ( Briggs ) : Get him on his feet . - No , please . - Come on , let 's go . ( Bang , screaming ) - What the fuck was that ? * No ! Shit ! He locked himself back inside . - Come on . ( Moaning in distance ) ( Sam ) : Graydon , let 's go ! ( Woman in distance ) : No ! ( Bang , woman sobbing ) ( Creaking ) ( Woman wailing , bang ) No ! ( Bang ) No ! ( Chains clanking ) ( Bang ) ( Metal object being dragged , clank ) ( Whispering ) : We shouldn 't be here . This has nothing to do with us . ( Whispering ) : Turn that light out . ( Repeated banging ) My God ... ( Graydon whimpers ) ( Sniffing ) ( Gunshot ) ( Screaming ) ( Gunshot ) ( Snarling ) We gotta go , Sam . ( Screeching ) Now ! ( Gunshot ) ( All snarling ) ( Panting and whimpering ) ( Distant screaming ) ( Gunshot ) Go , go , go , 90 ! - Come on ! - Fuck ... ( Screaming ) ( Gunfire ) ( Shouting ) ( Screams ) - Come on , Sam . Come on ! Damn ! Graydon . ( Man screaming ) He 's gone . We gotta move . Go on . Go ! GO ! GQ ! - Come on ! ( Man howling ) ( Gunfire ) Fuck ! I 'm out ! - Come on ! Go , go ! ( Both snarling ) ( Panting ) ( Man howling ) ( Snorting ) ( Screaming ) - Briggs ! ( Voice echoing ) Here , give me your hand . Give me your hand ! There are still people alive down there . - We can 't help them , Sam . We can 't help them . ( Panting ) - Briggs , don 't you think we should keep moving ? - No , the temperature 's dropping too fast . We won 't make it . Come on . - Briggs ? - Yeah ? - Those people ... how can they ... - I don 't know , Sam . When people are desperate , they 'll do ... horrible things to survive . I told you I was an army captain during the relief effort , right ? - Yeah . - Yeah , well , I never told you what I saw . When ... when people lose control like that , when we go feral ... there 's nothing human left in us at all . We might as well just be a pack of wild dogs . See , during the relief effort , we had , uh , 20,000 people corralled in a stadium . Food got handed out . The sick got treated . But when the food ran out ... the people with guns started taking things from the people without guns . And then when there was nothing left to take ... they took people upstairs and decided who would live and who would die . It was ... it was the hunger . People couldn 't take it . It just drove them mad . We tried to stop it , we really did , but ... we couldn 't . Me and Mason - he was in my squad back then - we--we left and tried to find a place where we could make sure that nothing like that would happen . ( Sighs ) - You did . - Maybe . - You did . That transmission ... - When we get back , we 'll patch into the satellite and take a look . If they 've got the sun , we 've got the seeds . - No ... No , no , no ! - How many ? ! - Twenty ! Maybe more ! It 's hard to tell ! Oh fuck ... Our footprints ! Shit ! We 're gonna lead them back to the colony ! - We 'll stop them at the bridge . Come on . Come on . Come on ! ' Briggs , what are you doing ? ! - Stopping them ! Block the wind ! Okay - No ! - What ? - The fuse is out ! - Fuck ! - I 'm gonna relight it . - What are you doing ? Briggs ! - Listen to me . We 're fine . I light it . I come back . We go home . - It 's too late ! ( Groaning ) Briggs ! - Come on ! - Come on . Get it done . - Come on ! Come on ! ( Screeching ) ( Screaming ) Yes ! Come on , you dogs ! ( Screaming ) ( Bridge creaking ) ( Rifle bolt clicking ) ( Elena whimpering ) - Please . Just give her the goddamn test ! - No more tests . - No ! Oh no ! No ! ( Dex sobbing ) - Mason ! - Things are gonna change around here . - Are you fucking crazy ? - No . I 'm seeing things clearly . You know the test is bullshit . The delayjust puts us all at risk . - Drop ... your gun ! - Help ! Help ! - Sam ? Sam ! - Oh fuck ! Fuck ! _ Sam ! Sam ! Sam ... Come on , come on . - Hey , you 're okay . You 're safe . - How long have I been out ? - A few hours . ( Gulping ) ( Sam breathing heavily ) - Sam ? Where is he ? Where 's my boy ? - I tried . - No ... ( crying ) * No ! - We lost Briggs too . What are you doing ? - There 's been a change in command . We need to take precautions . Briggs ' rules don 't work anymore . We need to be tougher to survive . From now on , rations will be cut in half . Anyone showing signs of sickness will be tested immediately . If you don 't pull your weight , you don 't eat . - Mason ! Where 's Kai ? - What happened , Sam ? What happened out there ? - They killed them . Everybody at Colony 5 is dead . Briggs cut them off at the bridge . Stopped them . - Stopped who ? - These people ... they slaughtered everybody ... for food . Do you understand ? And they 're coming here . And unless we get out of here , they will kill us . - And where are we gonna go ? - There 's a thaw . I know where it is , okay ? I can get us out of here . I can show you where- - - He 's in shock . Give him a sedative . - Let me show you where it is . - No one 's going anywhere . Viktor , let 's go topside . - You need to listen to me ! - Viktor ! Are you with me ? - Mason , you need to listen to me . Mason ! Mason ! - Sam ... - No . Nothing . You know , Sam 's a lot of things , but he 's not a liar . If he says something 's coming for us , we better be ready for them . ( Blows ) - Keep an eye on the monitors . ( Sighs ) _ Sam ! - Oh my God , are you okay ? Oh my God ! Did he hit you ? - It 's fine . - Did he hit you ? ! - I 'm fine ! Are you okay ? - Give me a sec . - Ah ... - There . Come here . - What happened out there ? - I gotta show you something . - Bring up 2 . - Nothing . - This is bullshit ! - Mason ! Sam got away . - And how did he do that ? Rowan . That little bastard ! Come on , let 's go ! - 47 above the line ... - What are you looking for ? - A thaw . Come on . - Sam ... Sam , there is nothing there . I 've already looked . - No , it 's here . I know it 's here . - Sam ... - Come on . There it is . - Holy shit ! - Look ... - Oh my God ! That 's gotta be , like , 8 miles of blue sky ! - Let 's go . Come on . - They took the weapons , the maps , everything . - Shit ! They didn 't take these . - What are you doing , Sam ? Sam , what are you doing ? - We need to tell the others and we need to get the hell out of here . Let 's go . Come on . Come OH , come OH , come OH . - Going somewhere ? - Yeah . We 're getting everyone together and we 're leaving . - No one 's leaving . - Go fuck yourself , Mason ! - Hey ! If we don 't leave right now- - - Briggs is gone . I 'm running things now . - When everyone 's dead , huh , and you 're king of the fucking castle , then what ? - I 'll still be running things . ( Banging ) ( Banging ) - Oh shit ! We 're too late . ( clanging ) - Oh my God ! It 's Dex . - Believe me now ? - Anyone who can fire a weapon , get them to the entrance . We 'll hold them there . And get everybody else to the vault ! - Let 's go . Go on ! ( Banging ) - Come on , buddy , let 's go . It 's gonna be all right . Come on , guys ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! ( Bang , clattering ) ( Thud , clattering ) ( Repeated banging ) - You led them straight to us . - They 're breaking the hinges . ( Mason ) : Fuck ! ( Clang , screws dropping ) ( Wind whistling ) ( clanging ) - Behind us . ( Clattering ) ( Snarls ) ( whimpering ) ( Woman screaming ) ( Clattering ) ( Whispering ) : They 're already inside . In the vents . - Oh ... ( Shrieks ) - Mason ! ( Mason ) : Here they come ! ( Feral man shrieking ) - Fall back ! - No ! No more running ! ( Hisses ) - Everybody in the main hall ! ( Screams ) ( Snarls ) ( Feral men snarling ) ( Woman screaming ) - I 'm out . - We couldn 't make it to the vault . What the hell is going on out there ? - They 're inside . They 're everywhere . There 's no time . ( Kai ) : No ! No ! ( Both ) : No ! - Let us in ! Let us in ! - What are you doing ? - I 'm saving our lives . - Oh ! ( Kai ) : Let us in ! ( Mason ) : Open up ! - Get back ! ( Banging on door ) ( Kai ) : Mason ! ( Grunting ) ( Feral man snarling ) ( Gunfire ) ( Snarling ) ( Distant shouting ) - The doors ! ( Feral men shrieking ) - You locked us out of here . - Yes . - Fucking piece of shit ! - These doors are not gonna hold . - We need to get the fuck out of here ! This leads to the surface . - You 'll freeze , if those things don 't find you first . ( Feral man roaring ) ( Grunting ) - It 's our only chance ! - No , we stay . Hold them off here . - Come on , let 's go ! - We stay ! - Just leave him . - Come on , come on ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move . Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , let 's go ! Nothing personal . You 're gonna need every bullet . - Come and get it , motherfucker ! ( Clucking ) ( Roaring ) - What do you want ? - More . ( Screaming ) ( Panting ) ( Screams , growling ) - Kai , look . ( Colonists coughing ) ( Coughing ) _ Sam ! Sam ... Sam ... What do we do now ? - We walk . With these ... at least we have a chance . Now come on . Come on , let 's go . We used to live and die by the rules we made . Come on . But our rules , like everything else we built ... are breaking down . There 's only one rule left now anyway , one rule above all ... survive . Come on .

 In my flash-forward , I was in my office . It was 10 : 00 on the hour , and I happened to see the date- - April 29 , 2010 . Oh , my God . This is it . We 're here . How 's it going ? Struggling with the decoherence equation . The equation ? Yeah , you- - you do the math . You do the numbers together , and then you 're both part of the equation . What 's your name ? Keiko . We have a shift down at immigration tonight . I have something I have to tell you . Yeah , me , too . We 're here now . This is all that matters . I want to be a part of what 's going on with this baby . You don 't have to do anything now . What if I don 't want to walk away ? I 'm gonna be on this plane tomorrow . I 'm hoping you will be , too . We ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on suspect zero . Simon Campos is suspect zero . Who 's Hellinger ? Hellinger 's our boss . Face down ! On the floor ! Simon Campos--is he here ? No , Janis . I need your help . Mommy ! Mommy ! Oh , sweetie ! Oh . It 's okay . Deep breaths . You 're okay . You 're okay . What happened ? I had a bad dream . You did ? It 's okay . Today 's the day . Oh . Yeah . Yeah . But you know what ? It 's gonna be all right . I 'm right here . Today 's the day daddy 's gonna die . You work with my security detail , so you know what will happen when everyone finds out that the mad scientist was awake when the rest of the world was asleep- - I 'll be a dead man . What do you want , Simon ? I want revenge . I want to destroy the people who are really responsible for the global blackout . Look , they 're cornered now . We have Hellinger in custody . You , of all people , must know it goes beyond one person . I want to get back at them . And who are they ? I don 't know , and they had me install a piece of software into the mainframe to make the accelerator fire on October 6th . We 've been over that system a thousand times , and we didn 't find anything . Well , I designed it . I 'll find something other people won 't . Let me bring you to the bureau , Simon . We can help you . I can 't do this with the FBI . I can 't do this with the CIA contacts . Those people won 't let me anywhere near the mainframe again . Look ... You get me into n.L.A.P. , I 'll turn myself in . Why did you start working for these people in the first place ? I was a kid ... Told me I was destined for greatness . I believed them . That was a marathon night , but we did it . We got Hellinger . Yeah , we did it . It 's not the end , though . Got a full morning with the digital forensics guys- - no , you don 't . You got a flight to catch . Here . What the hell is this ? That , my friend , is 15 covers of " islands in the stream . " There 's my morning jacket , feist , the constantines , some band from Croatia - when the hell did you make this ? Yeah , I don 't get much sleep . Dem , you 're alive . In the future you saw , you weren 't . Go to Hawaii . Go be alive . Are you kidding , man ? It 's d-day . We need all hands on deck . No . The place is packed with CIA , FBI , NSA . We 're covered . Mark . Go . Pick a version you like . Dance with your bride . What 's up ? Nothing . Everyone gets cold feet , Dem . It 's not cold feet . Do you love her ? Come on . Do you want to marry her ? Hell , yes . So what 's stopping you ? You know , even with the way everything went down ... Even though I lost her ... Marrying Olivia was the best thing I ever did . Don 't be afraid , especially on a day like this . You 'll stay home from school today with me , sweetie . Hello ? Hey . It 's me , Lloyd . Hey , Lloyd . Can I call you back ? Uh , no , there 's no need . I was st , um , I wanted to talk about tonight . You know , I really can 't think about that right now . I-is everything okay ? Charlie 's having a really hard time . Well , yeah . You know , I 'd really like for us to be together . You know , can I ... I-I 'll call you back , okay ? Sweetie . Where 's Demetri ? He 's taking care of something else . What do we got ? Hellinger invested big in dot-coms in the early ' 90s , then dumped them before the crash . He put those earnings into real estate . Got out at the height of the market ? Every transaction . He bought low , sold high . Future-casting . Yeah , listen , they use the flash-forwards to determine the outcome of a particular event , then put money on a sure thing . So was this the bigger conspiracy you were talking about in Hong Kong ? Because it sounds like econ 101 . Imagine how you could use this technology . To manipulate geopolitics . NSA just finished up with Hellinger . It 's been eight hours , and he just said his first six words ... " I 'm only speaking to mark Benford . " Finally . We need to talk . Did you cause the global blackout ? We actually have something more pressing that has to do with you . Did you cause the global blackout ? Yes , I caused the blackout . But that really doesn 't matter now . We can 't change that . How 'd you do it ? I 've seen today more times than I can remember . And a lot of those days started with me sitting right here with you . May I ? - This ? - Please Thank you . There are so many possibilities- - different paths this day could take . I have seen so many different versions of this moment ... And the next one and the next one . But in every version of the future I saw ... I saw this . In this room , you will lose control . And then you 'll lose everything . You 're going to attack me , mark . You 're going to attack me because you realize you will never get the answers to your questions . And then at the end of it all , you 'll be killed in your office . When 's the next blackout ? I 've seen how this goes , mark . If you keep me in custody , you will die . I 'm sorry . You drew me a picture , and now you want me to let you go ? I know it seems self-serving , but please , you have to believe me . This--this is your life . Tell me how you did it and how to stop it from happening again . If you 're not interested in saving your own life , I don 't have much to say to you , Agent Benford . That 's all right . You just told me what your next move is . Mind if I take this ? You know we 're kicking civilians out at noon , right ? Yeah , I was just packing up my stuff so I could carry on working at home . I 'm sorry . Can I help you with something ? That symbol . What is it ? The tachyon constant . It 's a theoretical number that physicists have been trying to crack for centuries , sort of a Holy grail thing . It was on these blueprints that Dyson frost was carrying . It was in the formula in my flash-forward . Well , at 10 : 00 tonight , I 'm supposed to be on the verge of cracking something monumental . That would certainly qualify . I don 't know if this will help or not , but there it is again . Lucas Hellinger drew this . He included that symbol as something his side is gonna do today . I want to beat him to the punch . So what the hell is a tachyon wipe ? Nothing . Doesn 't make any sense . The tachyon 's a particle . You can 't wipe it . You literally can 't even touch it . Hey . Hey happy flash-forward day . I know you love these . They 're for you . Wow . Thanks . I was just thinking about you . Liar . Um , seriously . Check it out . So I haven 't planned out everything for tonight , but I thought maybe we could start with some water polo . Uh , we could Bob for apples , maybe finish off with some scuba diving . Uh ... Yeah . Keiko . Are you sure that you 're okay with tonight ... With us ? So the sweet , sexy woman that brings me cupcakes ... Worried about a pretend girl who lives half a world away ? Come on . Keiko-San ... Attention , travelers . You are not required to give money to solicitors . The airport does not sponsor their activities . Hi . Oh , baby . I knew you 'd come . Oh , my God . So my parents are already at the hotel , and they said that there 's a hot tub in the room . Do you remember the last time we had a hot tub in the room ? Yeah . You ready ? Um ... Can I talk to you for a minute ? Yeah . Okay . Ahem . What 's up ? I love you . And , uh , I should have told you this ... A long time ago . In Janis ' vision , she was ... pregnant . Mm-hmm . For that to come true , it had to happen while she was in Somalia . Okay . I slept with Janis so she could get pregnant . - What ? - I know that was wrong . The future was happening , you know ? My life was ending . Another life was beginning . I know it sounds crazy , but ... I thought I was gonna die , and ... It made sense at the time . Everything that I 've been doing , Dem ... All the--all the lines that I 've crossed , the--I did everything for you . I did everything I could . I-it was because I-I believed that ... I believed that you were gonna live and that we were gonna spend the rest of our lives together . Obviously , you didn 't . I am so sorry . So sorry . I just thought that our life together was over on march 15th . That 's what I thought . I was wrong . You were right . You believed that we can change the future . But I want to start over . I want to marry you . Please marry me . Please ? Um ... I 'm gonna , uh ... I 'm gonna go to Hawaii with my parents , and I don 't want you to come , Dem . And , uh , after that ... I don 't know . Don 't worry , Tracy . We made it . This is where we were in our flash-forward . I was in a cave . Jericho brought me here . Honey , don 't worry . Don 't try to talk . She needs a hospital . I 'm not sure I can care for her here . Her pulse is thready . They made me tell them . Tracy , we know what we saw . You 're gonna be fine , all right ? Tracy . Khamir ! Tracy . Tracy . Tracy ! I cross-referenced Hellinger 's financial documents with the word " tachyon . " Tachyon offsite information systems . Their office is in Arcadia . Do you think that 's what Hellinger meant by a tachyon wipe ? They warehouse data . Maybe you can 't wipe a tachyon , but data 's a whole other story . I 'm going in with a team . Whoa , mark . You sure that 's a good idea ? Going after the bad guys ? Yeah . Think about it . Hellinger helps organize a worldwide blackout . You really believe he 'd be sloppy enough to leave you a clue like this ? Maybe . People make mistakes . Forget it . What ? You heard me . You 're staying . You stay on Hellinger . I 'll send a special ops unit to check it out . No . No , no , no . No , no . You can 't do that . I can . You 're staying . I 'm not letting you walk into a trap . She 's barely moving air . Tracy , breathe ! Tracy ! Please ! No , no , no , stop . Aaron , please , let me work . Please . You . What the hell did you and your Jericho buddies do to her ? Aah ! You 're gonna tell me why Jericho came after my daughter . I 'm just an independent contractor on a security- - aah ! She saw you guys killing an entire village . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Aah ! You 're gonna tell me why now . We weren 't killing them . She saw an entire village full of people passed out on the ground . It was an experiment- - a test run . For what ? Aah ! Keep talking ! The experiment 's radius was 1 kilometer . We needed to know why she was awake . Experiment for what ? Aah ! For what ? For the global blackout . I hope the CIA gives you an expense account . We 're gonna have to stop by a hardware store , pick up some supplies on the way to N.L.A.P. Breaking into a linear accelerator- - I think we 're gonna need a little more than duct tape . Not that kind of hardware . Dem ! What 's going on with you , Janis ? What the hell is he doing here ? Tell him to put down his weapon . What 's he doing here , Janis ? ! He 's making a deal . You 're bringing him to N.L.A.P. ? You 're planning to let him touch that accelerator ? He can give us more information than anyone else can . In the meantime , you risk him using that machine to put the world to sleep again . Hey , I didn 't use it the first time . I 'm not gonna use it this time , either . Hey , hey , Dem ... This is about nailing the people behind the blackout . This is about getting the job done the best way I know how . Janis , come on . You got more to worry about than just doing a good job . Okay , Dem . I just need you to pretend like you never came by . Just let me do this . No . Aah ! Aah ! You 're gonna regret this decision for the rest of your life . We 've secured the tachyon data center . All we 've got is a room full of servers . Has the data been wiped ? No . It 's weird . I 'm getting nothing- - just a blinking cursor . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . It sounded like it was coming from a storeroom . I thought you swept the place . We did . I 'm gonna go check it out . We 're getting thermal readings back now . No . Get out of there . Get out of there , Agent ! Whoa ! Heads up ! Movement on your- - Watch out--9 : 00 ! Get out of there ! Mark , wait . What 's going on ? They opened fire on three of our guys . You were right . Tachyon was a trap . Whoa . Cool down . No , I gotta go talk to him ! Cool--cool down . Don 't worry . I got this . I got this . Daddy ! Oh , hey , sweetie . You okay ? Yeah . Hey , Stan . Are you ? Yeah . It 's been a slow day . Babe , you want to go wait in daddy 's office ? Look , I 'm really sorry just she 's scared . Here like this . I think the reality of today and , you know , everything that 's happened - I think it 's really hitting her . She just needed her dad . I-I really did not know what else to do . I 'm glad you brought her over . Hey , Charlie bear . Charlie . What 's up ? I don 't want you to die . Come here . I need to ask you to do something for me , something really , really hard . Don 't be afraid . I mean , it 's okay to be afraid . It is . But that 's just what happens at first . After that , you have to tell yourself something- - " my daddy loves me , " and everything will be okay , no matter what . " " My daddy loves me . " So much . " And everything will be okay , no matter what . " It 's not easy , 'cause things can be scary , bigger than us . But we can fight it . That 's what I do . I tell myself , " Charlie loves me , " and everything will be okay no matter what . " You do ? I do . I tell myself that , and it makes me strong . It makes me brave . 'Cause when I say that ... You 're always with me . And when I say it ? I 'm always with you . Always . I love you so much , baby girl . I love you with everything I 've got . Oh . Thanks , honey . Hey . You go and be with mom , OK ? You go ahead now . You 're making a big mistake . Shut up . Janis , this guy has been lying to us about everything . He was working for them . He was awake during the blackout . How the ll do you trust this guy ? After all the lying , I think I 've realized that you just get to a point where you can 't do it anymore . You coming with me ? To the FBI ? Yeah . No . Tell ' em where you found him . Don 't lie for me . This N.L.A.P. Thing is totally insane . You know that , right ? Yeah . I know that . If I hadn 't have shown up , you would have gone through with this ? Yeah . Get in . No , Dylan . Dylan , watch out . I am watching . No , it 's a figure of speech . I mean , be careful , 'cause somewhere in here is the answer to a very big question . Why did the 8 die ? What ? Why did the 8 die ? Oh , no , no . That 's , um , that 's not an 8 . That 's infinity . What 's infinity ? Uh , well , infinity means " forever . " But you 're right , it does kind of look like an 8 on its side . All the ones with numbers have to be together . No , Dylan . Just please , please leave those there . It all has to be in the right place . What did you say ? It all has to be in the right place . Do the numbers . You do the numbers together , and then you 're both part of the equation . Okay , Dylan , Dylan , Dylan . Go and get your coat . Go now . Go , go , go . I hope your agents are all right . In most futures , they survive . When 's the next blackout ? I don 't know if you 're in a place where you can hear this right now , and I don 't want to say I told you so , but I gave you a choice , Mark . I asked you a question . When is the next blackout ? I gave you a choice , and you chose the wrong path . I 'm sorry the way this is turning out . I mean it when I say that . But there is nothing you can do to turn this back around . Shut up ! When is it ? You 're going to die , mark , and I take no pleasure in that . I really don 't . I 've had so many conversations with you in this very room . You 're a decent man . This is just all over your head . When is the next blackout ? Mark , you work hard . You 're passionate about what you do . All of it . But don 't you see ? All of it ? Is is just so futile , we caught you . Your faith--it 's admirable . I mean , that board in your office- - how much time have you spent on that thing ? How much time have you spent just looking at it , all on faith ? But deep down , you 've gotta know what that board really is- - tell me . What is that board about ? It 's nothing but a scrapbook of your failures . Tell me when the next blackout is . A freed Nazi , a-a botched mission to Somalia , some monster paintings , dead birds ... Tell me . And you keep looking at it . You keep believing , and you keep fighting 'cause that 's what you do . You and that board , you 're Mr. Stick-to-it . Don 't you see ? That 's why you 're gonna die , Mark . You just don 't give up . You just ... Oh , I swear to God , mark , I am gonna miss you . Charlie 's gonna miss you , too . You are gonna die , mark . You 're gonna die , but there is an upside . And this is gonna sound a lot harsher than it really is . Deep down , you know what I mean . You 're going to die . But your daughter 's going to be better off when you 're gone . I 'm not finished ! Aah ! Let go of me ! Clean yourself up , playboy . Get him the hell out of here . You gotta be kidding me . You 've been on the brink of losing control all day- - all year . That crazy son of a bitch- - out , now . I don 't care what day it is . No , Stan ... Get him out of here . Get out . You can 't do this to me ! You 're not gonna do this ! We are gonna have so much fun tonight . I promise . I was just really looking forward to a picnic . That 's what we 're doing . We gotta get there early and stake out some good seats for the fireworks . Just , there 's gonna be 2000 other people . I wanted to be with you . Hey . There 's never been a night like tonight . I mean , in four hours , people are literally gonna be deciding whether to make their own futures happen . I want to be witness to that . Why ? ' Cause your future didn 't happen ? Oh . Where 'd that come from ? I 've just been thinking a lot about the visions lately , and I 'm ... I 'm worried mine may have already started . You 'll be with me . Nothing is gonna happen no , to you tonight.Not. I promise . Come on . Let 's go . You know , it 's not the drowning . It 's that feeling I had , you know , like I deserved it . I 've been keeping a secret from you . It 's really stupid now , because when I tell you , you 're gonna hate me . Come on . Give me some credit . Keiko . She 's in Los Angeles . What ? I 'm sorry . I should have told you as soon as I found out . But I just ... I was afraid you 'd choose her . No , just ... Just tell me where she is . Some people from the hospital- - they went down to this immigration detention center in Lancaster . She 's in--in jail ? No , it 's--it 's just a holding facility . You let her stay in- - in jail ? I should have told you , Bryce . I 'm sorry . Keiko Arahida ? There 's someone here to see you . I need a transfer guard at the main Gate . Keiko ! Keiko ! Okasan . Aaron ! Aaron ! Her heart has stopped ! I need your help ! Come o Aaron ! Aaron ! Tracy ! Tracy ! Trace , no ! Just breathe . Breathe , Tracy . Trace ! Tracy ! Oh , no . Come on , sweetheart . Come on , sweetheart . Come on ! This can be right . Tracy , come on back ! Come back to me , sweetheart . Come back to me . Yeah ! This is just all over your head . You have no idea . In every version of the future I saw , i saw this . The forces of the universe are maybe pushing us towards the futures we have seen . You are gonna die , Mark . But there is an upside . Deep down , you know what I mean . Your daughter 's gonna be better off when you 're gone . Uh , excuse me . Hey , look , I don 't mean to bother you , but , uh , in my vision , I had just quit drinking . And I , um , and I 'd really like to make that happen right now . See , I saw you , and you ... you look like you can use this . Here . No . It 's okay . I don 't ... What made you change your mind ? I don 't know . I mean , I get why you did it . It worked . We have Hellinger . But , Janis , I was so pissed off at you . Working for the CIA ? Since Quantico , I ... I felt like I lost my best friend . It 's like I didn 't know who the hell you were . You know , and then I 'm driving away . I got Campos in the backseat . I 'm looking in the rearview , and I 'm thinking , going to N. L.A.P. ? This is ... It 's so like you . I know you , Janis . I mean , I don 't know what you were doing . I don 't know what the hell we 're doing tonight , but I ... I do know you . I told Zoey ... - About the baby . - What ? Oh , Dem . You know , there just comes a time when you ... You can 't lie anymore , right ? Aaron , we need to stop now . She 's gonna be okay ! Her brain has been deprived of oxygen too long . I know what I saw ! She 's been through enough . We were here together . Her heart has stopped beating . She 's gone . Aaron . Let her go . I saw you , Tracy . Tracy . I saw you .

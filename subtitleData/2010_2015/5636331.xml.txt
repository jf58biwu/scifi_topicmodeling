 Want to take turns ? No need , I 'm still strong . We just go home , alright ? Michiru , you 're the one that invited us to come here ? ! That 's true , but .. Enough , I can walk by myself . Cannot . You can 't force yourself . I 've told you , I 'm still able to . I ... have decided ! I will bring Saku the peak . Why do I have to obey your decision ? You 're not the king . You 're the king carrying the warrior . Let 's run ! Take a look . Rainbow ! ENOSHIMA PRISM Deslycious project : Indonesian Subtitles . Translated to English by jcsoh . You want to sleep until when ? I 've open the window . Just open it . Hurry , get ready . Almost two years have passed .. Why Michiru doesn 't return ? She will not return . Sick ! Puffed out your chest ! Why , anyway ? I 've not dreamed about my childhood for a long time . In the past , we 're always in threesome . That time , until just before the death of Saku . Shu-chan , please wait on the 2nd floor . Here . - Please give it to Saku . - A love letter ? - You could say that .. - Then give it yourself . You never understand the feeling of a girl , alright . - Wait .. - You 've a match , right . Hey , give it back ! Please .. You 're not come to my matches ? - You 're worried if the Goddess Victory doesn 't come ? - Goddess , who ? Maybe I get to met Saku after the match . That 's all right . Shuta ! Take care of yourself . Why is this so ? Ah , Shu-chan . What is it ? It 's Saku here ? - He 's having an examination . - Ah , is that so ? Can I borrow Saku 's bicycle ? My bicycle 's chain broke . Just use it . - Then .. this . It 's from Michiru , please give it to Saku when he come back .. - Alright . Shuta ! Shuta ! He said he fell .. in front of the station . Why did he have to run full force .. Why ? He wanted to send off Michiru . Michiru ? He said she is going to England to study . It was written in the letter . Shu-chan .. Please see Saku 's face carefully . Sorry to keep you waiting for so long . Sorry , yes . - Have some coffee . - Thank you . - The sugar 1 .. 2 .. 3 .. 4 , huh ? - Ahh , at that time I was still in elementary school . - Ah , so , yes . Shu-chan had been a student , huh ? - Ah , I 'm a night school student . - Then I 'll get another one . - Don 't bother . - Really ? The taste that I use to know . I left everything as it used to be . Only in here time seems to have stopped . - I think Shu-chan will not come . - I 'm sorry . During the funeral ceremony , you didn 't go in ? Do you feel responsible ... ? To be sure .. he died of because of his illness . It 's destiny .. his time is just till then . I always think like that . If that 's the excuse then I can accept it . Please come here frequently . Saku would definitely love it , I myself certainly will feel happy . Alright . If you want , you may take something . Call it a keepsake , for remembrance . - Remembrance ? - I don 't want Saku to be forgotten by his friends . Because the saddest thing is .. when we are forgotten . I 'm not likely to forget . Thank you . Please if you would like to look around , I 'll go downstair first . " Kimi mo Time Traveler " - " You 're Also An Explorers of Time " What 's this ? How to wear .. Imagine the future that you want to go to . Can really travel through time with stuff like this ? Why .. are you dressed like that ? Saku ? ! - 2010 .. 2 years ago . - Oi ! What are you doing ? Sorry . Saku , what 's today 's date ? December 20 , are you okay ? a day before your death ? - I think I 've seen this . - I. .. came from the future . - Wah , great. if so where 's the time machine ? - You don 't believe me ? - Did you think I 'm going to believe ? - Of course you will not believe , yes .. We must leave immediately , if we 're late , Michiru will definitely be noisy . Michiru ? Damn , why is she calling us during the winter holidays like this ? ! - Saku ... you 're Saku ? - I 'm Saku . Good morning . You guys are late ! You guys are so late ! Long time no see , huh . Didn 't we just met yesterday ? Moreover , why are you dressed like that ? Today he 's very weird , maybe it 's because he ate the mushrooms that grow on the back of the gym . He said he is a time traveler . You eat mushrooms like that , fortunately your stomach is not having any problem . True enough , 2 years ago I got food poisoning and diarrhea . Damn Saku , why I just believe him and ate it . Because of that , in the game the next day , I was not able to move even slightly . Damn Saku ! - Explain why you ask us to come to school . - That 's .. a secret . What the hell is that .. Shuta ! What 's with Shuta ? ! - My stomach really hurts . - It 's your stomach . Did we come to school just to clean up ? - What ? - It 's nothing . Don 't just complain . I think this would be a beautiful memory . Isn 't cleaning up work the duty of the student council ? Where are the others ? The high school kids are busy with studying , part time work , dating . Busy , you know ! The only one free are you guys . - If me , not a problem , but Shuta have an important game tomorrow . - Shuta , what time is your basketball practice ? Nevermind , tomorrow for sure we would lose . Why do you say that ? That not as usual . I told you we 're going to lose . I was aiming for 3 points .. but failed . - Looks like you already know the end result . True enough , he said you came from the future , right ? - Future ? Time machine watch ! Boy ! What , you don 't believe ? Why ? True or not we 'll prove it later . Ready ? - This photo is for what ? - Evidence that we 've clean up . Look ahead , smile . Did the photo came out nicely ? If today is really 20 december , 2 years ago .. ... then tomorrow .. Michiru would go to England without telling us . Shuta ! Wah , that 's great . - Hey , take a look ! - What ? - Great . It 's beautiful . Prism , huh ? Ah , I 've got a great idea . Done ! Shuta ! It 's finished . Thank you . You have to think about where is the direction of the light . Why is there a gap as wide as this ? - It should be like this . - Ah , like this , yes .. Most beautiful . I 'll definitely not forget this sight . Previously there has been such thing , right ? Right ! When we were in 3rd grade while climbing to the Enoshima 's hill peak . - Rainbow ! We saw it , yes . - Shuta you still remember it well ? I 'm not likely to forget it . This time .. it will last forever . Uh , isn 't that Shuta ? Didn 't he said he can 't come to practice because of food poisoning ? His excuses , yes .. I wouldn 't let him . - Come on , let 's go . - Yes . Michiru , tomorrow you .. Shuta ? He disappeared ? You want to sleep until when ? I will open the window . I 've told you to just do it . Quickly get ready . 2 years had passed .. Why Michiru doesn 't return ? She will not be back . Hoi ! What is it ? Mom , what date , what month and what year , is today ? December 20 , 2012 . Did you forget the death anniversary of Saku-chan ? So I 'm back ? Are you okay ? You had a strange dream , huh ? Dream ? It doesn 't seems like it .. You should really wake up ! Shuta-kun ? - Have not met Matsuda-sensei for a long time . - It 's been a long time since we last met . What 's up ? 2 years ago , did you see a rainbow in this class ? Rainbow ? - So that was your doing ? - You saw it ? - Absolutely beautiful . It was not a dream .. Sensei , you 've done research on the nature ? I 'm still doing it to this day . - Do you think that the past can be changed ? - What 's up suddenly ? For eg . , we take a trip into the past , then changed the events there until it change the future . Is something like that .. possible ? Shuta-kun .. Are you going to write a Science Fiction novel ? Yes . For eg . , you ride a time machine and go to the days before you were born , and then you kill your parents , what do you think is the effect ? Why do I have to kill my parents ? As an example only ! If I kill my parents , I would not be born . True ! So if you were not born , the you from the future going back in time and killing your parents , then your existence will disappear in the future . This is called the " Time Paradox " . So as long as the " Time Paradox " can 't be broken , then we can 't never ever travel through time . Travelling through time can be done , I 'll prove it . Shuta-kun .. Previously why didn 't you join the Occult Science Research Club ? Because I 'm was not interested . It 's that so ? So the theory of " Time Paradox " explained the existence of a parallel world . Parallel world ? We 've demonstrated that there was an incident in the course of time . So if you change the event , then the future will change and a new world emerged . It could also be called a new present life . A new present life ? Alright , I continue with this theory .. because if only by example it will not be enough . Excuse me ! Shuta-kun ? Fight for it ! The past .. ... has obviously changed . Sorry to keep you waiting . I 'm sorry . Please have some coffee . Shu-chan likes 4 sugar cubes , right ? - That was when I was in grade school . - Is that so ? Sorry . - True .. Shu-chan is already .. - A Night school student .. - Right ? - True .. Delicious . I let it remained the same as before Only in here , time seems to have stopped . Aunty .. What ? I think .. I was responsible for Saku 's death . If that day .. I didn 't deliver the letter .. didn 't borrow his bicycle , for sure .. .. he doesn 't have to run to the station . - Shu-chan , you 're wrong .. - the time that had stopped , I 'll definitely return it . I 'll prove it ! Because of that , this ! Can I have this ? Sure , not a problem at all .. it 's not a problem . From now on I will come here often . Oh yes , then also ... Saku , wait for me . I 'll take you to the new future . Now what date is it ? December 20 , 2010 . Yosh ! Thank you . This side , yes . What are they doing ? - You .. - Where have you been ? You change uniforms ? - To .. the toilet ! This is because of yesterday 's mushroom ! My body .. Why ? What is it ? All of you look busy . Saku . Saku . What are they doing ? - He said they would call Kyoko-chan . - Ah , the one who died by suicide ? Kyoko-chan is one of the legends of our school who died by suicide . - That way it 's believed can summoned her spirit . - True . She said she is in despair every rainy season , huh ? I 'm sorry for Kyoko-chan . If she had committed suicide there must be a reason why she is still trapped in here until now , right ? Should we help her out ? She can 't get out . Maybe she can curse and haunt somewhere else . Do you believe she committed suicide ? Shuta don 't believe ? I don 't believe in such a thing .. not at all .. You must be scared , right ? If such a thing really exists . Shuta 's a coward . I 'm not afraid . If you 're afraid to close your eyes , then you 'll be scared more afraid at night . True . Conversely , if you just close your eyes then darkness will disappear . I 've told you I 'm not afraid . Where 's Shuta ? Gone where ? Shu .. ta ? Shuta-kun ? No he , yes .. I 'm leaving . Wait , why are you wearing a uniform ? Shit ! Why I can come back ? Why ? Excuse me ! Shu-chan ? Aunty , I 'll like to ask for this . Sorry for disturbing . Please . This time I would change Saku 's destiny . Where did you all hide him ? We didn 't do anything ! Sensei , least he 's hidden by the Gods . There is a possibility he was taken by Kyoko-chan . Can he come back ? If so , yes . It makes sense . What 's make sense ? I 've told you .. Shuta ? ! I was really worried about you . Where did you disappear to ? Where ... ? The world 2 years in the future . Do not tell me you just came back from the afterlife ? - How is the world existing there - Any flowing rive ? - Over there , there 's a flower garden , right ? - Then you met your late grandmother and she ask you to go back again , right ? I ... don 't remember at all . Amnesia ? I think I felt dizzy , so I realized I 'm confused about what had happened to me . Matsuda-sensei , you can do hypnosis , right ? I 'm an expert . So what ? What 's this ? What do you all want ? Hoi . Let me go ! So cool ! What 's so great ? ! Wait . - Shuta-kun . - Yes . - You will be hypnotized . Hypnotized ? The human brain stores all that is heard and seen . Even if you don 't remember , this way everything will emerged again . Even the events that occurred in a previous life This way if you can 't regain your consciousness back , your memories and life could be in danger . - Yamaishi . - Yes . In other words , we have to purify this place ? True , therefore I want all of you out . - Good luck ! - Wait .. You don 't want to ? - You must be scared , right ? - I 'm not afraid . Then let 's try it and see if we find something . I 'll go accompany you , because there nothing to hide . No , you just get out . Do you have a secret ? For example , you want to be like me , then rip your uniform sleeves in the same place with me ? Ehh , did you fix it ? What are you talking about ? Enough , we 'll just wait outside , Saku . Just go out . Shuta-kun , don 't you want to join the Occult Research Club ? No . I 'm not interested . True enough . Look carefully at this fire . It 's swaying , right ? Focus on it 's swaying .. Left .. Right .. The fire .. is swaying .. Left .. Right .. Left .. Sensei ? Let me introduce myself . My name is Kyoko . Greetings to .. Kyo .. Kyoko ? ! It 's appeared ! Ghosts ! Sensei ! Wake up ! I still don 't want to die . Wait ! Don 't come any closer ! Ghosts ! - Wait , sorry .. - I 'm not a ghost . You said , you kill yourself right ? - No . - Then you 're not a ghost . - Can 't really say that either . I 'm not dead , maybe I can 't die . So I will not be able to commit suicide and become a ghost . So .. - I 'm a " Time Prisoner - Time Detention " . - Time prisoner ? I 've been stuck here since I was 16 years old , and could not get out . So if there are others who have been through time , they would understand . You mean , me ? At first you were accidentally thrown here , but after that you came back here on your own free will , right ? Are you thinking to change , to fix , what 's happening in the future ? You 'd better stop it . Why ? Because there 's a reason why we should protect history . Reason ? Because it will mess up the laws of nature . If you were to change the past .. .. Surely you will face a frightening thing . Sorry , I don 't want to scare you . - Are you really 16 years old ? - Why ? The way you talk .. is really different . I 'm a 16-year-old girl who has gone through decades . You .. must be lonely . Ahh , sorry . Are you alright ? Eh ? What happened to me ? You kept on sleeping . I failed , huh ? - Hey , you ! - What ? - Don 't just lazing about . - I 'm also working , you know . Tomorrow .. If till you lose tomorrow , I 'll laugh . The game .. Are not you going to come see ? It 's obvious , right ? Liar ! Hey , Michiru . Maybe my speech is not important , but .. if you have important things to say , please say it with your own mouth . What important thing ? For example , writing a letter to someone . Don 't ever use that method . Do you .. really intend to go oversea without telling anyone ? Do you think we 'll stop you ? If you think like that , I 'd be pissed ! Because it 's weird , right ? We 've been threesome since childhood .. But we can 't send you off . Hey , say something ! Michiru ! - What are you doing ? - I just finished cleaning . - You 're hard working , yes . - Just now it against the rules . - Can you show up in the normal way ? You scared me , you know . No one should know that you are a time traveler . Then what should I have to do ? How can I be able to save the live of Saku ? Where are you ? Saku ... died .. because of my fault . I 'll do anything , to save Saku . It 's too dangerous for you to do it openly . You have to do it as natural as possible .. Ensure that Saku take a different decision than before . Tomorrow Michiru will go outside oversea , if I say it now .. Shuta , where did you go ? He disappeared again . Surely to go to the toilet again . I know you 're anxious . Do you want to help me ? Thank you . I remind you , this is not going to work out easily . Perhaps the future could be worse than before . Do you still want to do it ? There is no future without the presence of Saku . The future is not just yours . But I can 't possibly stop you . It seems if you 're in a shock or your heart is beating faster , you 'll go back to the future , First we must cure it . - What do I have to do ? - Let us use the Jack Fin 's approach . Jack Fin ? What is it ? He 's a person who always write fantasy novels . - Fantasy novel ? - Science fiction . - Because I 've been for so long , I 've read all of his novels - Uh , all of them ? Every single one , almost 2 times each , while Jack Fin 's work , I 've read more than three times . - " Marion is no Kabe - " Marion ' Walls " , " Ni Furidashi Modeoru - Back to the Beginning " .. - His novels is about what ? Should not bring things that don 't exist in this era from the future . Only that ? Then pray to stay alive in this era . It 's that easy ? You 're so confident that this is easy ? This means that you should not leave anything at this age . - Whatever I 'll do . - You need to undress . Is that so , alright . The pants ? Take off everything . Yes . Don 't leave it here . Ah , that 's right . Sorry . What shampoo do you use that is sold in this era ? No , this is the latest product in 2012 . Then you also have to eliminate the smell . He ? You also need to trim your nails . I 've never heard of having to cut the nails while time travelling . Pieces of nails alone can be a problem when time travelling . Give me a break .. Is this enough ? Maybe .. Emergency . One more time ! Just relax . Do you like fireworks ? I 've never seen it . Eh , even though fireworks display is held every year ? I know . But I just hear the sound only . So even from the roof of this building , it 's also invisible ? May I ask you something ? Since when are you here ? Since after the war ended .. There . Michiru ! - I can only help till here . Further more , you must fight for it . - Yes . Don 't be pushy , just let it all flow . I understand . Stupid ! Michiru ? Don 't just arbitrarily disappeared . Sorry . Aaah , the day pass by so quickly . We have to go home . Michiru . Saku . Did you go to the fireworks festival this year ? No , I didn 't go . I had exams on that day . Me too . Why ? Come on , let 's go play with fireworks . Fireworks ? Michiru , if you have time .. would you accompany me in a short while ? But .. This day is still not over , right ? Although till night ? Alright . Saku , help me to look for fireworks . Alright . Yosh ! What have we collected .. Wait for me ! Shu-chan , are you okay ? Come quickly . Actually , what up with you ? Shhh .. don 't be noisy . - Why do we have to tiptoe ? - Shhh ! It would be difficult if we get caught . Come on . - You have to shut it down . - Ah , sorry . - Only rarely do people play fireworks in the winter . - Right , AKN ? What if we make it till he 's upset ? Hey , Saku . What do you feel about Michiru ? - Hah . What dis you say ? - It 's nothing . Come on . Thank you . - Sister do not forget to eat - Same with you too . It 's not like you guys are not familiar with it ? This 's Michiru 's favorite . It looks good , thank you . Hey , have you said goodbye to your friends ? Al ... already . Much obliged . - What are you doing ? - Saku , this is cool , right ? - Saku ! You 're ignoring me ? - Let 's go . Even though it 's cool .. Come on ! - Cellophane ? I don 't need stuff like that . - Nevermind , I 'll get it . - I helped pick it up . - Be careful . Much obliged . - Saku ! We got a lot of fireworks . - Great . - What did you ate ? Shuta . - It looks like we 're doing something bad . - This will only happen once in a lifetime . - Danger . - In school at night .. AWESOME ! - Can you keep quiet ? Okay , don 't be noisy . - Scary ~ - I told you don 't be noisy . - What 's the hell with you ? - You must be terrified just now ? Saku , how ? It 's perfect . - Look carefully Michiru . - It 's a Christmas gift from me and Shuta . Begin . We made it ! - Terrific ! - Be careful . - Terrific ! - Take a look ! Keep it down . It 's most beautiful . Saku .. Shuta .. Thank you . Already so late ? Ah , soon it be a new day . Well , we end with this . Whose firework falls first is the loser . We have to bet with what ? - Our lives . - I don 't want to - Are you afraid ? I 'm not afraid . Why don 't we .. speak about the things we 've kept a secret ? What is it ? Among us there are no secrets , right ? There is , either Saku or me . Also Michiru . I don 't know what , I 'm not going to lose . 1 .. 2 .. Say it , Michiru . The things that you 've keep a secret . For example , " Actually I 've stopped dieting " ? That not it ? Things that you should tell us Anyway , just say it Michiru . Sorry . Michiru ! There is something odd about you . Can 't , huh ? The fight .. tomorrow . I 'll definitely change your destiny . Why ? How is this , Jack Fin ? Nothing . Mother , where my mourning clothes ? Mourning clothes ? You want what ? It 's time to go to Saku death anniversary , right ? You 're dreaming , huh ? You already went yesterday . Here , also had changed by a day , huh ? Excuse me . Aunty ? - Hello , Mom ? - Shuta , how is she ? Her life could be saved ... Thankfully , I 'll be right there . Wait , alright . Possibility , the future will change becoming worse than before . It 's destiny that his time is just till then . I can 't .. let it end like this . Nothing . Where is it ? Please .. I beg you .. Damn ! " Time Traveler " .. Shuta-kun . Kyoko-chan ? Just stop it . Why ? Whatever you do , the result will certainly remain the same . Saku 's fate is to die from a weak heart . I don 't want to . Whatever happens , I will not let Saku die . Although until I 'm helpless .. I 'm not going to let him run . - If you do that .. - What will happen ? I 've already told you , right ? There is a reason why we have to keep the history . - It will mess up the laws of nature .. - Say it clearly ! Everyone connected with you .. will lose their memories about you . Including your own memory too . Missing ? If you were to change one 's destiny , it means that their lives should be rewritten from scratch . Michiru-chan , Saku-kun too .. They will be someone else . Precious memories of all of you .. Everything will disappeared . Memories ? Everything ? I. .. do not want you to end up being like myself . That 's right , I really don 't want to .. .. Forget the memories of our time together . But .. I 'll still do it . Why ? Because I want him to live .. even though he be a Saku that I don 't know . Because I want him to laugh ... even though she be a Michiru that I don 't know . Since 2 years ago , when you were at the fireworks show that night .. I kept waiting . I want to thank you . Kyoko-chan .. Thank you , for making memories with me . If everything is settled , I 'll come see you again . Wait for me Saku .. Wait for me Michiru .. Pain ! Shuta ? - You want to go home ? - You stomach is still in severe pain ? - Don 't go home , this is our last game . Today is the match ? In other words , this is the day when Saku died . - You certain you can . - Wait . It 's not the time to play . Shuta ! Shuta , are you alright ? Pain . What am I doing ? Damn ! Damn Saku ! There is someone . - I 've guessed you were here . Have you already given Michiru 's letter to Saku ? - Eh ? - Who ? - Enough . Quick answered ! Already given . - Stupid ! - Who is stupid ? ! Today 's game you certainly will lose , it 's useless for you to try . - How can you know ? - Never mind . Next times have more self confidence . In the future . What the hell ? Shit ! Why can 't returned earlier ? Saku ! Come up ! - Michiru .. will go to England . - I know , get in ! So you know she 's is going ? Do not worry , definitely still have time ! - Are you hurt ? - Nothing to do with it ! Wait for us , Michiru . Saku ! Promise me ! What ! You must make Michiru happy ! - What is it ? You know .. - Come on ! Promise me ! Although in the end .. you will forget that promise . Michiru ! Shuta ? Saku ? If you want to express your feelings , convey it on your own . I don 't know what to do if receive a letter like this . Well , say it . What are you talking about , Saku ? Stupid . Read it . - But .. - Just read the last part . Read it . I entrusted Shuta to you . Please remind him not eat too much iced food . During the exams , please contact him every night . Say " Fight on " . Give him spirit . Before each match , told him " If you lose I 'll laugh . " Should he really lost , take him to the karaoke . Occasionally , talk about your illness . Maybe .. there is something you can not decide alone . Finally , if Shuta love someone .. Please call me immediately . At that time .. I quickly fly from the UK to return to Japan . But .. this way I 'm relieved . It 's better like this . What 're you talking about ? Michiru .. If one day we meet , smile at me . Even if you do not know who I am . I will certainly reply to your smile . What 're you talking about ? Saku .. I .. entrusted Michiru to you . Are you alright ? Ah , sorry . Much obliged . You better .. accompany her till the airport . Uh , who ? Bye . Goodbye , Saku .. Goodbye , Michiru .. Goodbye .. Myself . I will remember you . I 'll never forget you . That .. prism , huh ? Ah , no , it 's just a plain quartz stone . But it 's beautiful , right ? Yes , it 's beautiful , yes . For you . I often find it around here . Thank you . Thank you . Thanks for watching !

You sure ? Drones don 't lie . This is Anya Sparks 's car . Sparks must have figured outsomeone could find it . Had her meet him here , picked her up . Yeah , the dronesdidn 't think of that . Now what doyou want to do ? They must be hiding someplacein these hills . Well , you used to be a cop . Time to act like one . It looks like a kidnapping case . This man took a small child . You should talk to SheriffDugan when he gets back . Sheriff Dugan iscurrently on a call . You can wait around forhim , if you 'd like . When do you expect him ? Any minute , unless he stopped off for a burger at Jay Jay 's . It 's not every day we get to host acouple of Feds . We 'll check back later . Coming ? Alan , why did youdrag me up here ? It won 't make any senseif I tell you . I just have to show you . This ... This place hastoo many memories . I never should have come . Please , Anya . You 've come this far already . You know me . I 've never had the kind of faiththat helped with anything . But seeing this ... Just promise meyou 'll give it a chance . Give what a chance ? Okay , enough . Mommy . SPARKS : She 's real . It 's not possible . You can touch her . It 's not possible . I was gone ... but now I 'm back . Oh ! Sheriff Dugan , there weretwo federal agents here about a kidnapping . They should still be in town if you 'd like to tryand find them . A kidnapping ? Your drone footagefrom the Wimberley Woods shows a man who matchestheir description of the kidnapper.I 've notified Nancy . And if you 'd like , I can cross ...

Gets what ? The miracle of all this . Life ... somewhere elsein the universe . Life that we can ... I mean ... you had a child with it . So , what was it like ? Your encounter . I guess the reasonl 'm asking is I 've heard some prettyhairy stories . It must 've been terrifying . ( quiet laugh ) No . It wasn 't . ( laughs ) I 'm sorry . I mean , if this ishard to talk about . I just , I-I want toknow what to expect . No . It 's-it 's not hard . I saw someone . He died a very long time ago . And-and justto see him again was ... well , it was beautiful . This was Marcus Dawson ? From the academy ? He , uh ... died in a car accident , right ? I 'm sorry . Yasumoto gave me your file . I read through iton the flight . Yeah . It was him . You see , that 's thereal miracle here . The fact that theycan bring back the people that you 've lost . Well , I didn 't just lose him . I lost our babyin that same crash . I 'm sorry . That 's , um ... that 's tough . And I think that 's exactlywhy he came to me . It 's not just that we getto see the people that we lost . ( stammers ) It 's like we get to start again . You know , we-we-we getto go down a new path . If that is your child 's gift , to guide us down thesealternate pathways , then this is truly what I 'vealways dreamt of seeing . A moment of punctuatedequilibrium . An evolutionary leap forward . Your child could be that leap . ( quiet laugh ) Well , you know ... you know , I 'm not one of these blue marble ladies . So ... " Blue marble ladies " ? Well , you know , astronauts go to space and they seethe Earth and ... it looks likea big , beautiful blue marble . And then they start to think that everything isall peace and love . ( laughs ) Well , the universe doesn 't careabout us or our survival , so I never boughtinto any of that . I mean , 99.9 % of every species that has ever existedhas now gone extinct . Cheerful world view . My point is we careabout our survival even against those odds . We 're still here . I mean , that 'swhat evolution is , right ? Maybe ... every bad thing that 's happened is just a result of himtrying to live , trying to protect himself . Exactly . And that 's why we needa different approach . ( engines humming nearby ) We should get going . You ready ? We 'll take the check . WOMAN : Right away . Thank you . KRYGER : When you get outof town , there could be 20 miles of forest inevery direction . We know Sparksmade it this far . And travelingwith the Offspring , this forest is as good a place to hide as any . The drones should be able to give us a location soon . We can 't wait for that . He could be moving . Well , if you wantto poke around the woods on your own , be my guest . Or we could just ask him . Man you 're looking for , I know where he is . Come with me .

We aimed our shipstowards something . And this is what happened . But how does it do ... what it does ? I don 't know . It 's half human . It seems to be ableto find them for us . The people we 've lost . Connect us to them . Bring them back . We need to keep it safe . Not just so that Katiecan stay with us , but so that everyonecan have this gift . Mommy ? Yes ? You won 't make me go backto that dark place , where dead people go ? It was lonely there . No , darling . I won 't ever let yougo back there . Never . How long till Mom comes back ? She should be donewith her research and meeting us at home soon . As long as we 're here , there are a few diagnostics I want to run down in the lab . Will Odin be there ? You two really seemto be hitting it off , huh ? I like him.He knows about things . MAN : I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to ask you to remain here . Heat sensors , huh ? Mr. Yasumoto gaveexplicit instructions . Until the immediatethreat is contained , he really doesn 't thinkit 's a good idea for you to leave the office . We were just going to rundownstairs to my lab . What 's an immediate threat ? Nothing . Just a misunderstanding Mr. Yasumotois helping us clear up . That 's right , son.Just a misunderstanding . It 's just so much easierfor us to keep an eye on you up here . I 'm sure you can understand . It 's for your safety . Please . ( birds chirping ) Just the two of us , right ? You 're taking meto meet him ? Of course . That 's the idea here . And that 's it ? We get your baby . We bring the two of you back . Then Mr. Yasumoto putsall of his resources at your disposal .

She 's not gone . I 'll take care of this . Just wait here . I 'll take care of it , Anya . Katie ? Kate ? Katie . KATIE : Daddy ? You 're here . Molly 's coming . What ? When ? He needs your helpto complete his mission . He needs you to get Molly to dosomething that has to be done . Far away . I 'm not sure I understand . He needs to do something to her , and he needs to be strongerto do it . Stronger ? He 's going to need to feed again . Like what he didwith that sheriff . You won 't see me again unless youhelp him . ( coughing ) I 'm all right.It comes and goes . You have to pullit together . We don 't have timefor you to detox . If you go soft , I 'll leave you . That 's whyl left Molly . I thought you saidyou got split up . ( sighs ) You left her in there to die ? I didn 't haveany choice . You didn 't see whatit made me see . Well , did it make youleave a friend to die , or was that your call ? I don 't know what you imagine . Some kind of second comingor the care and feedingof your new pet alien .

Happens all the time . Uh , my wallet 'sjust inside . Oh , we got a potof coffee on . I bet you 'd like a cup . Yes , I would . ( muffled screaming ) ( muffled screaming continues ) Is this what it takesfor it to do what it does ? ( muffled screaming ) There are two kindsof feedings . I bring it food , and it seems to grow at an exceptional rate . And then there 's this . ( muffled screaming ) What its other half needs . They don 't die , but theyare different after . You try to makeyour peace with it . Mommy . Look what I made . ( muffled screaming ) Everything comesat a cost . We can have our Katie back . I don 't care about the rest .

( sighs ) Look , I 'm sorryabout this . I really believe that thisis the best way to do it . With force andmore armed men ? I don 't think that 'sthe way to do it . Like I said before , it 's just a contingency . Molly . Your baby ... it 's half yours and half this ... other . And yes , it 's tryingto protect you . And yes , it wants you , but this other ... Frankly , it wouldbe presumptuous to believe that itthinks like we do . Because he wants to live ? And needs his mother ? I guess I 'm presumptuous . And I guessl 'm cautious . Look , we both wantthe same thing . We both want to keepyour baby safe . I 'll keep my baby safe . ANYA : " ' I won 't , ' said Alice . " ' Off with her head ! " the Queen shouted " at the top of her voice.Nobody moved . " ' Who cares for you ? " said Alice . " She had grown toher full size by this time . BOTH : ' You 're nothingbut a pack of cards !

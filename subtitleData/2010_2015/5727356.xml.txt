 STEVE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... CLAUDIA : H.G. ' s not really here . She 's a hologram . That thing is projecting her . I drew my gun on Mrs. Frederic and she fired me . How can my mom be a Regent and not have told me ? MRS. FREDERIC : Collodi 's Bracelet . ARTIE : It fell into the hands of a young boy . MRS. FREDERIC : The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . But it would have planted a seed of darkness in his soul . Claudia , now would be a good time to pinpoint that signal . I 'm trying , but whatever 's transmitting from inside the Warehouse has slowed the whole system to a crawl . ARTIE : Pete , Myka , any sign of the intruder yet ? Atlanta-36J is quiet . Ditto in Montgomery-84K . Clean in the Farnsworth aisle . The archive is safe . Well , keep looking . Someone or something is still transmitting . ( SIGHS ) Pete , you head to the Dark Vault . And Myka , you go to aisle ... CLAUDIA : Gotcha . Sulaco-84C . It 's there . Sulaco-84C . That 's right near the art gallery . Let 's go , Claudia . Bring the scanner . That 's why the computers have been so glitchy lately . We 've got bugs . To be specific , nanites . Oh , man . What are nanites ? I don 't know . Tiny , self-replicating , microscopic robots . Mechanical fleaslspies . They could have hitched a ride on anything . No , no , no , not these . These were planted on that Van Gogh that Sally Stukowski helped us retrieve . That painting 's now exactly one gram lighter . That grab was a setup . And she 's working for that psychopath that tried to kill my mom . Walter Sykes . CLAUDIA : They 're downloading a massive amount of data and transmitting it . MYKA : To where ? I can 't tell yet . I want those things out of my Warehouse now ! It could take me days to interface with their coding , Artie . Well , then plan B , when you got bugs , you zap ' em . Oh , crap . Oh no , no , no , no ! Oh , what are you doing ? Something wrong here , Tyler ? Uh , no , Mr. Sykes . Uh , I think the Warehouse found and shut down all the nanites . Before you got what I need ? No , no , I got it . You 'll be happy . Have you decrypted the data yet ? I 'm working on it , sir . Finish it . Then I 'll be happy . Yes , sir . JANE : These nanites could be a fatal breach . Do we have any idea what Sykes was after ? I 'm typing as fast as I can . Okay , first he rifled through some inventory . Looking for the Collodi Bracelet , I 'll bet . Then he downloaded a file , Atlas-66 . But it 's majorly encrypted . That file is for Regent use only . Well , here 's hoping . Claudia , you think Sykes could have opened that file ? Uh , I 'm not even sure I could crack it . Well , you don 't have to . Jane has access . She can tell us what 's in the file and we can finally get ahead of Sykes . That 's not how we 'll proceed . But this could be our chance to shut Sykes down . The Regents have a plan in place , Agent Bering . You 're not going to tell us what 's in Atlas-66 ? Perhaps I haven 't been clear . We have a plan in place . Well , perhaps I haven 't been clear . We need to know what 's in that file . Right , Pete ? Hmm ? Uh , well , Myka , if she says there 's a plan in place , we need to respect that , right ? I mean , she is wearing the Remati Shackle , so Warehouse protection is her call . JANE : Thank you , Pete . Now , excuse me . I need to speak with Mr. Kosan . Excuse me , I need to tag some stuff in the motorbike aisle . And with that , we all just left it alone , right ? Of course . Right . Lattimer ! What the hell is going on ? Trust me , Myka . Arguing with my mother will get you nowhere . So you 're just going to lie down ? Who are you ? A guy who knew you 'd follow me . ( REMOTE BEEPS ) Old chum , welcome to the Pete Cave . Sit down . I 've got something to show you . You 're not going to make me watch Porky 's again , are you ? No . So you 're not just sitting back ? ( SCOFFS ) Please . Okay , now these are the facts . Walter Sykes , paralyzed as a child . Gets his hands on the Collodi Bracelet , which allows him to walk again , but apparently turns him into , like , the worst guy ever . Right . The Warehouse snags it , Sykes wants it back . He makes millions in hedge funds . Then , 10 years ago , he cashes out and apparently vanishes off the face of the Earth . So he 's been planning a run at the Warehouse for a long time . Right , but the minions he 's hired to do his dirty work all have one thing in common . They 're dead . The obit says that Stukowski died of an undetected heart defect . ( SCOFFS ) Yeah , right . So who 's working for Walter Sykes now ? Everything okay ? Yeah . Stay close . I 'm going to need you two to collect something important . We 're ready . You wanted to talk to me , Mr. Sykes ? Steve , you still trying to decide if you can trust me ? Well , the enemy of my enemy is my friend , right ? Look . I just want my life back . My old job , my reputation . The Warehouse burned you . It burned me , too . You know , the Regents have a nasty habit of reaching out and destroying people 's lives . Believe me , I 've noticed . So , if I help you get the Collodi Bracelet back , you can get me reinstated at the ATF ? Yeah . Or you can have a blank check and start a new life . That 's your call . Tyler cracked the first part of the file . We know where it is . The only lead we have left is this man , who I clocked in Atlanta . It 's just a face and a car . It 's not much to go on . Okay , so we profile , right ? I mean , what kind of person goes to work for a man like Walter Sykes . A guy like Tyler Struhl . Hey , did you follow us here ? What ? No , I 've known about the Pete Cave forever . Who do you think keeps it stocked with cream soda ? Really ? That was you ? Wait , who 's Tyler Struhl ? The hackerlperv who was killing women with the Golem Necklace . Hacker codes are like a signature and Tyler 's all over the nanites . Could he hack into the Regent file ? If I can , he can . I mean I haven 't been able to open the whole thing , but I did dig out an address . Lincoln High School , Cheyenne , Wyoming . Cheyenne 's only like two hours from here . We should check it out . Against Jane 's orders ? ( SCOFFS ) What 's she going to do ? Ground me ? Anyway , I 'm not going to sit around here and wait for the next bad thing to happen . I agree with Pete . I 'll run interference . Go , go now while she 's still with Kosan . This is a dangerous game . We must bring the rest of the Regents in on your plan . No . Sykes has already tortured and killed Regents to get information . The less they all know , the better . This is a great burden for you to bear alone . Perhaps we should simply eliminate Walter Sykes now , and ... Adwin , we all agreed that we needed to know his endgame . Without that knowledge , even with Sykes gone , the Warehouse is still vulnerable . There 's more that 's troubling you . My son is on the frontline of this war . If I 'm wrong , I could lose a lot more than the Warehouse . MYKA : I 'm going to take upstairs , you take down . ( SCHOOL BELL RINGING ) Hey , Mykes , you got anything ? I think I found what Sykes is looking for . You found the artifact ? Not quite . H.G. Wells is here ? What , she broke out of Regent jail to come here ? I want to go talk to her . Myka , no . We know how lethal she is . We don 't know what she 's up to . Just wait there for me . Helena . ( IN AMERICAN ACCENT ) Hello , are you looking for somebody ? Do the Regents know you 're here ? Um ... I 'm sorry , you must be lost . The main office is straight down the hall ... Look , we don 't have time for games . Some very dangerous people know that you 're here . Um ... Okay , uh , there must be some mistake here . Let 's just call school security and then ... Freeze ! ( SCREAMS ) Well , that 's new . Why 'd you come in here all guns-a-blazing ? That 's an escaped H.G. Wells , Mykes . What if she was having one of her let 's end the world days ? No , something 's wrong , okay ? She 's acting like she doesn 't even know who I am . Well , at least we know what Sykes is after . But what 's he want with Lady Cuckoo ? Hello . Hi . EMILY : Who are you people ? What do you want from me ? We 're United States Secret Service . We may be dealing with a case of identity theft . We just need to see your driver 's license . It 's in my purse . Careful , Myka . Well , it could be booby trapped . ( CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY ) ( MYKA CLEARS THROAT ) Pete , look at this . Who the heck is Emily Lake ? I don 't suppose we could put a doggie door on the umbilicus ? ( LAUGHS ) Doggie door . You 're silly . What 're you doing ? Uh , you know . Updating the firewalls , reviewing inventory , blabbity , blah , the " ushe . " ( SIGHS ) Fine , okay , you got me . I 'm playing Fruit Combat . Until Jane tells us the plan I 'm bored-zo . All right . I 'm going to my room . Trailer . ARTIE : Busted ! ( GASPS ) Did you just Mrs. Frederic me ? Tell me that is not the Regents ' encrypted Atlas file , and that you are not doing the one thing that you were explicitly told not to do . That would be lying , and if there 's one thing I 'll never do ... Where are Pete and Myka ? I still don 't know why the Secret Service has to see my apartment , but here it is . And I 'm not this Helena , whoever that is . Look , it 's not that we don 't believe you , it 's just that we want to understand what 's going on . ( CLATTERING ) There 's something in the kitchen . Oh , Dickens . Mommy 's home . H.G. Wells is a ... Cat lady ? Yeah , good boy . Hello . Dickens is hungry and scared . Just like his mommy . Wow . I 'm going to feed him . Shoot me if you have to . Myka , we don 't have time for this . I mean Sykes could be on his way here right now . Bills , magazines , they 're all addressed to Emily Lake . Okay , so she fooled the post office . It 's not that hard to do . Myka , don 't buy this . She is a lunatic killer and she is just hiding it somehow . Pete , oh , my God , look at this . There 's no reflection in the mirror . She wasn 't really there . These are all fakes . Somebody must have created a new identity for her . Who does that sound like to you ? The Regents ? Some sort of Witness Protection Program ? We got this info from the Atlas file . Atlas-66 . That 's it . H.G. Wells was born in Atlas House in 1866 . I can 't believe that I missed that . Yeah , sloppy . We 've got to get her somewhere safe before Sykes finds her . Let me go . I 've got a knife . All right , let 's not do that , okay ? Oh ! All right , okay . Do you see ? H.G. Knows Kenpo . If she wanted to hurt you , you 'd be lying in a pool of your own blood right now . I don 't want to hurt anyone . I just ... Wait . MYKA : What is it ? I got a vibe . A bad one . Aw , you just missed her . Where is she ? What does Sykes want with H. G ? Time machine ? Minoan Trident ? Or just another homicidal maniac to add to his roster ? He was right . You are a talker . Who was right ? ( YELLS ) Ahhh ! ( CAT SCREECHING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Ah ! Ah ! Ahhh ! ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( PANTING ) Hey , are you guys okay ? Pete . Steve , what ... He took my Tesla . You 're working for Sykes ? Where 's Marcus ? Marcus ? Oh , is that your new partner ? The guy who just tried to kill me ? I 've got some bad news for you , pal . What the hell ? Is that H. G ? Yes . And then we 're done . ( EMILY SCREAMS ) No ! ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) ( MOANS ) ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) ( GASPS ) Farnsworth . You are both in big trouble . You don 't know the half of it . We lost her , Artie . Wait , lost who ? Emily Lake . You two found Emily Lake ? Where is she ? Sykes has her . Damn it ! This is why you follow orders ! Sykes would have gotten her either way and we wouldn 't have known about it . We know who 's working for him , Artie . A guy by the name of Marcus who just walked away from a five-story fall . What ? And someone else . Someone we know . No . No way . That 's ... Artie . That 's not even possible . Steve would never turn on us . We 're his friends . He must be being controlled or blackmailed or maybe there 's an artifact . Honey , honey . He Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . He kidnapped H.G. No one was forcing him to do those things . Then this is the Regents' fault . They burned him , they gave him no choice . Everyone has a choice ! And as I 've discovered , people often make the wrong one . Please , I have no idea what you 're talking about . I 've never even heard of any Warehouse 13 . You are H.G. Wells . That 's insane . My name is Emily Lake . Emily Hannah Lake . I grew up in Omaha , and ... ( SCREAMS ) You 're lying . She 's telling the truth . You 're absolutely certain ? You know I can tell , and she 's not lying . Or at least she believes what she 's saying is true . Yeah , well , I 've got a gift , too , Steve . Getting people to tell me things . Cecil B. DeMille 's riding crop . It won 't work . It lets you bend people 's actions to your will , but you can 't control their minds . You 've collected quite a few artifacts . Yeah , enough to even up the odds . I 'm inclined to trust your gift , Steve . I mean , after all , that is why we sought you out . So we 'll leave Miss Lake alone and give Tyler enough time to crack the rest of that file . Hopefully , the answers are inside . For her sake . MYKA : What exactly did you do to H.G. ? Myka , it was the most humane option . After the near catastrophe at Yosemite , well , the Regents had to do something . The punishment was unusual , but it wasn 't cruel . We searched for something that would give H.G. A chance at a normal life , while still allowing us to use her as a resource . Claudia , I assume you 've cracked the rest of Atlas-66 . Yep . A Janus Coin . Two heads . It facilitates the separation of a person 's consciousness from their body . Like the zoetrope did to Hugo . The zoetrope is a machete , the Janus Coin is a finely honed scalpel . Artie , show them the video . It will make it clear . ( IN BRITISH ACCENT ) So , how exactly will this work ? ADWIN : In Roman mythology , Janus is the god of transitions . His two heads look in opposite directions . Forward and back . My past life and my future life . Yes . And the coin will separate the two . So I 'll lose all knowledge of the Warehouse ? Yes . And everyone I 've ever known . Yes . ( SIGHS ) One request . May I keep my love of literature ? That can be arranged . We 'll start with your earliest memories , mother and father . That 's right , move through your childhood , your young adulthood , your first day at Warehouse 12 . Tell me what you 're thinking . I met an old man . He was my teacher . His name was Caturanga . Tell me his name again . I ... I don 't remember . Good . Think about your inventions , your experiments , your writings . Picture Kenpo and weaponry . People , friends , family , lovers . Let their images come to you , conjure them . Your whole life in England , let it go . You 're American now . ( GASPS ) ( IN AMERICAN ACCENT ) Who are you ? I 'm Mr. Kosan . You had a terrible accident and you lost your memory . But I 'm going to help you get it back . Thank you . We sent her to Wyoming , gave her a place to live . A cat . Photos of a past that never existed . And we gave her a job . Schoolteacher . Like you . As for the rest , well , the human mind is pretty inventive . Given enough time and stimulation it fills in the gaps all by itself . So if H.G. ' s memory 's been wiped , then who 's the hologram we 've been talking to the last few months ? Not wiped , stored . On the Janus Coin . Which , according the file , is kept in a Regent vault in Elk Ridge , South Dakota . Sykes has got to send Marcus and Steve for the coin . Look , I know that the Regents have a plan , but we can 't risk Sykes getting a hold of that coin . Yeah , he already has Emily Lake , if he tries to put H.G. Back together . You 're both right . You and Myka need to retrieve that coin and bring it back here . Mr. Sykes ! Mr. Sykes ! I got it . I found what you 're looking for . And the best part is it 's not even in the Warehouse . MYKA : So how do we get into this vault ? PETE : Mom said all we need is this fancy key and this list of stuff to buy . This is the Regent vault ? Of course it is . Hidden in plain sight . That 's what they do . You got our list ? Alfred , let 's go shopping . ( SCANNER BEEPING ) ( SCANNER BEEPING ) That 's weird . Not when you get to know us . I gotta get my manager . Okay , fruit , grain , meat , alcohol , honey , these are all items that the ancient Egyptians used to leave for their kings in the burial tombs . Which were also known as vaults . Right . Man , the Regents really loved the Egyptian stuff , huh ? It 's like a fetish . I know . Oh , definitely in the right grocery store . Come with me . The key . Oh . Ah ! He 's not very chatty , is he ? No , he 's not . I 'll be in the stock room . Okay , so here 's the sphere . Where 's the Janus Coin ? I remember seeing a slot . Uh ... Ah ! See ! I always loved piggy banks . What ? Let me see . So , then if the coin is like the hard disk , then to reboot we just slide it back in . ( IN BRITISH ACCENT ) Oh , hello . What 's this ? Another mission ? Lady , we 've got a lot to tell you . Living with a cat in Wyoming ? Also , you have an American accent and a really girly scream . So my body 's out there teaching high school English . And your students love you . But a cat ? Dickens is solid . Saved my bacon . Yes . I don 't know what that means , but what does this Mr. Sykes want from me ? We were kind of hoping you could tell us . I 'm afraid I have absolutely no idea . Get her here as fast as you can , keep your eyes open . Be careful . Stick to the back roads . The back roads ? Driving from Elk Ridge to Univille ? Good point . Stay alert . ( SIGHS ) JANE : I don 't have a good feeling about all this . I 'm not used to military maneuvers . I 'm an elementary school teacher . Elementary school teacher to Regent . Strange trajectory . Not at all . Each Regent is selected for his or her area of expertise . Each brings a unique perspective . I was chosen for my insight into children . Jane , what 's the downside to the Collodi Bracelet ? If the user wears it for too long , it plants a seed of darkness in the soul and creates an insatiable longing . And at the same time , this longing hardens the heart . The wearer cannot give or receive love . Is it possible , all those years ago ... We didn 't get to the boy in time ? Hey , Myka . I have a thought about a way to protect the Warehouse . But ... But what ? But you might not like it . Well , if it protects the Warehouse , I like it already . What is it ? CLAUDIA : Whoa ! Where are we going ? PETE : Off road . We have to destroy the Janus Coin . What ? I know you 're going to think this is personal ... How could I not ? You 're ... You 're talking about killing a human being . No , I 'm talking about destroying the thing that Sykes is after . We can stop him right here , right now . She has one of the greatest minds in history . It 's ... It would be like burning down a library with a friend trapped inside . I know . But we 're at war and unfortunately wars have casualties . No . Okay , so you 're willing to live with the possibility that Sykes might get what he wants . H.G. Would never help him . Myka , the man has proven he can get information from anyone . Even Steve is working for him . No , he 's not . I know he 's not . Okay , just hold up . Both of you ! We have to deal with reality . Wait , Claudia ! Claudia ! Myka , I 'm just thinking of the greater good . As long as that coin exists , it can be used against the Warehouse . The answer is still no . We cannot . I will not destroy H.G. Wells . H. G : May I offer an opinion ? I figured she should be part of this discussion . There is no discussion . H. G : Agreed . If you truly want to protect the Warehouse , you must destroy the coin . Destroy the coin and whatever Sykes wants from me will be lost with it . But ... You 'd be gone . You 'd be dead . The price is too high . What about Emily Lake ? If Sykes thinks he can put her back together , she 's in a lot of danger . Destroy me and she 'll be of no value to him . Myka , you say she 's a teacher and her students love her . Then let me live on through her . We can rescue Emily Lake . I can promise you that . I have every confidence that you will . Myka , we have to think rationally , not emotionally . And quickly . Before I remember that I 'm not this noble . It 's the right thing to do , Myka . You know that , don 't you ? Pete , um , I think you 'll have to be the one to ... I know . I will . Man ... Thanks for everything , Helena . I regret I won 't be here to see you reach your destiny . It will surely be a glorious one . ( SNICKERS ) I don 't know about that . Then you 're the only one . How do you say goodbye to the one person who knows you better than anyone else ? I wish I knew . Be brave . I need your strength . ( CHUCKLES ) The last thing I want to see is the sky . ( SIGHS ) Pete . I can 't watch this . Me neither . ( SNIFFLES ) ( SIGHS ) Forgive me for this . ( GRUNTING ) Why can 't I move ? Because I 'm controlling your body now . I 'll get the coin . MYKA : Not one move . PETE : Myka , he has an artifact . How 'd you find us ? We traced the signal on Claudia 's cell . You traitor . Traitor ! Stop or Marcus is dead . Yeah , well Marcus doesn 't usually stay dead for long . Then I 'll shoot you , Steve . I don 't think that you will . Just in case . No ! ( GRUNTS ) Myka ! Claudia ! Give me the coin . You know what ? I got a better idea . How about you fill in the blanks , tell me how we went from being partners and friends to you pointing a gun at me ? How could you work for Sykes ? There are things that you don 't know ! About the Regents ! About Jane ! Now give me the coin . I know this . You want this coin . You 're going to have to shoot me . ( GUNSHOTS ) Claudia ! Claudia ! I don 't care what I have to do . You 're dead , man . You 're dead ! You 're very perceptive . Hey , where 's Claudia ? Where is she ? You get the coin ? Let 's go . Now you can help Claudia and Myka or you can follow us . That 's your choice . You son of ... Pete , if you 're going to help Claudia , you 're going to have to hurry up . ( GROANING ) ( PANTING ) Claudia ! Claud ! You all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Claudia ! Claudia ! Claudia ! Claud ! ( WHISPERING ) Please keep it down ! Why didn 't you answer us ? Is Steve gone ? He told me to wait until he was gone . Wait , wait for what ? Claudia , what 's going on ? How did he get the coin ? I gave it to him . What ? He told me your mom 's plan . You want this coin , you 're going to have to shoot me . ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) Listen , Claudia , listen to me ! I am undercover . The whole thing has been a setup . Mrs. F. Firing me in Atlanta . Jane and the Regents burning me . My mission is to gain Sykes ' trust so I can learn what he 's planning . Now can you calm down now ? Yeah ? But you Tesla 'd Pete and Myka . Better than letting Marcus shoot them . I wish that you could look in my eyes and see that I 'm not lying . I am still on your side , Claud . I always have been . I am so sorry that I didn 't tell you the truth , but it was the safest way . Whatever Sykes is planning , it 's bad for everyone in the Warehouse . I 've never seen anyone so filled with hate . Then get out of there . I mean why are you taking this huge risk getting chummy with those psychos ? Because ... Because I couldn 't save my sister . But I can protect you . ( CHUCKLES ) Show this to Pete and Myka , it 's where he is . And don 't make a sound until I 'm gone . Cover your ears . So brave . CLAUDIA : That 's why Jane couldn 't tell us . Steve is the plan . It all rests on him . He volunteered . He 'd had a lot of experience going undercover at ATF . And he 'd been here the briefest . ARTIE : It would seem more plausible that he would turn than anyone else . Why did he help Sykes find Emily Lake and H.G. ? Without him it wouldn 't have happened . JANE : His orders were to embed himself . Learn what Sykes is planning . ARTIE : And even assist him when needed . When Sykes enters his endgame , Agent Jinks will get us a message . We got the message . Skybrook 3 . It 's a decommissioned airport in Featherhead . It must be hangar three . That son of a bitch was under our noses the whole time . We 're on our way there now . Pete , be careful . I ... I love you too , Mom . ( SIGNAL DISCONNECTS ) Let 's see if this really works , huh ? What ... what are you doing ? What is that ? The end of Emily Lake . No ! Now just remember , just relax and remember . ( CRYING ) H.G. Wells ? ( IN BRITISH ACCENT ) It would appear you got to the coin before Pete could destroy it . You must be Mr. Sykes . Mmm . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you . Um , the plane 's ready if you want to go . Steve , I want you to know , none of this would have been possible without your help , buddy . ( CHUCKLES ) ( TIRES SQUEALING ) Move . Damn it . They 're gone . Too late . Pete ? What is it ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . They 're gone . Let 's get back to the car . What 's wrong ? Claudia , I said get back to the car . Pete ? What is it ? ( SOFTLY ) Please get back to the car . Pete ? CLAUDIA : ( SCREAMING ) No ! Claudia ! Claudia !

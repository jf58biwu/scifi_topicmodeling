 Previously on Caprica ... We 're racing to meet a military deadline , if I miss it , I may lose my company . You know we have a critical deadline to meet and only one working robot . It might be good if you were a bit more focused . Yeah , yes ... yes , sir . Vergis told me something awful about Daniel . I don 't know if it 's true . Two of my employees were murdered . The thieves took a sophisticated military computer chip . Are you trying to say that my husband killed those people ? My daughter 's alive in V-World , but I need a guide to find her . Who are you ? I go by Emmanuelle . Heracles said you were easy to find . " Look for the cube wandering all alone . " All right , start guiding . I 'm being challenged for the leadership of the S.T.O. by Barnabas . If the leadership on Gemenon thinks we can 't control our own S.T.O. cell ... Then trying to get our hands on Zoe 's apotheosis program is pointless . A group known as Soldiers of The One is responsible for the bombing . Look at the way the bike chain is drawn . It 's Barnabas calling for a meeting . I have to get Zoe 's robot to Gemenon . She says it 's critical , but I don 't know why . What is it exactly that you need from me ? You got some , uh , cargo you want to move off-world , what ? I can 't believe that Barnabas won 't help me . He won 't help you unless you 're S.T.O. I 'll become S.T.O. I exist inside a robot . Only my best friend , Lacy , knows . My part of the plan is getting the robot out of Daniel 's lab . I 'm Rachel from V-Match . Oh , hey , hi . I thought looking like the most hated girl in the twelve worlds would keep all the pervs away from me in the V-Club . I already have another date with cute lab boy . See , my point is that a robot could benefit from being in the real world . You know , let it out , explore . Get it out of the lab . No . Graystone stock has dropped 37 % , causing many to speculate that he will have to sell assets , perhaps even the C-Bucs . The Caprican red-tailed raptor has a larger wingspan and is primarily a night hunter . Look , I know people don 't always present themselves accurately in V-World , but Rachel 's already admitted that she tweaked her avatar to look like someone else . Who ? Zoe Graystone . Okay . Come on , aren 't you a little curious why she won 't let you see her in person ? She will when she 's ready . And by then , it won 't matter what she looks like , only how we feel about each other . You 're a better man than I am , Philomon . It 's another motor-control glitch . And you know you 're not supposed to be smoking in here . Sorry . It 's been like that for days . Must be those mysterioso tests Graystone put it through last week . Yeah . Poor girl hasn 't been the same since . It 's okay . I 'm gonna take good care of you . They need an answer now . How much time will this buy me ? A month maybe . But Philo has a new idea about how we can ... I don 't ... I don 't need to know the details . Just tell me we can pull this off , make the military 's deadline of 100,000 robots by next month . With this , we have a fighting chance . Sell the team , and you might save the company . All right . Tell Vergis ... I 'll sell him the team . Where the frak is that ship ? I don 't know . It was all set up . It should be here . Well , it 's not frakkin ' here , so what does that tell you ? Well ... Hello , Barnabas . Hello , Willow . What news ? The arms shipment you 've all been waiting for , you can forget about . I 've told your contacts that you no longer have the S.T.O. ' s sanction . Really , flower ? Did that all on your own ? It 's kind of cheeky . You reached out to other cells . While I 've been trying to get everyone to lie low , you 've been trying to build a power base . Wow , I am a bother . What are you gonna do with me ? You gonna run off to S.T.O. Central on Gemenon and tell on me ? Look , Clarice , sister , the leaders like action , not crazy plans that make you into a bouncer in some homemade heaven . Think God 's gonna pick out the chosen ones when they die ? Do you think you 'd be saved ? Do you want to find out right now ? You 'd die too . You 're a little boy , Barnabas . You need to toe the line , otherwise someone 's gonna get hurt . Control , we have the vehicle . Proceeding North on Colonial Five at high speed . Be advised , suspect vehicle has been commandeered by a Cylon prototype . Do not engage . Copy that . SK-1 , out . It was once the widest bridge on Caprica by one centimeter ... At a cost of 16.5 million cubits . One million cars would cross over the bridge in its first month . At a height of nearly 100 meters from mean sea level , the bridge has also attracted its share of jumpers . Few have survived the drop to the deep , turbulent waters below . Construction started nearly 40 years ago . It took nearly three years to complete . While steel-plate girders salvaged from the second bridge made barges for constructing the foundation of the O Street bridge , unifying the long approaches and the distinctive central span are heavy concrete railings . Amanda . Hey , Clarice , how are you ? Um , well , I 'm just packing up a few things . I 'm off to Gemenon . - You 're going Gemenon ? Yes , it 's , um , it 's a little business trip . What 's up ? I 've been in my room for the last few days . What about Daniel ? What about Daniel ? Have you thought about talking to him about this ? You know , maybe you should . That would have to work both ways , wouldn 't it ? Oh , he 's got secrets too , has he ? We 're gonna have dinner tonight . I really think that you should talk to him , okay ? It 's gonna be all right , Amanda . Have a good trip . Take care . Heavenly father , grant us the strength to fight those who have become blind to the path of righteousness . In the name of the one , we cast out the many . So say we all . So say we all . Now it would be great if you guys weren 't here . You too , Keon Lacy , stay . Come over here . I got something I want to show you . This big enough to hold whatever you 're hoping to ship to Gemenon ? Yeah . That 'll work . Look at the tag . It 's a green tag . What does that mean ? It means it 's cleared customs all the way through Gemenon . Exempt from inspections too . Wow ! That 's great . Thank you . You 're welcome . Now , you can 't go for a week or so . GDD 's raised the alert level , which means even a greeny can 't get you out right now . But that 'll , uh , give you a chance to really show me your gratitude . Okay . How ? I have a small task for you . A small but important task . Are you ready to serve our cause ? Yes , I am . Clarice Willow . Clarice ? Sister Clarice ? Yeah . What about her ? I want you to replace the fob on her car keys with this . It matches the make and model of her car . But why do you want to track her ? I guess I 'm not supposed to ask why . You guessed right . I 'm not ... Will you ... do this ? I will . Welcome to my cell . Joseph ... Joseph ... Joseph ... - It 's disgusting . - He 's sick . I don 't even recognize him anymore . He needs comfort food . He needs rehab . Go out and get some organ meats . What ... how 's that gonna help any ? He 's going to come out of this , and he is going to need his strength . I should just rip this thing off his head . No , you know you can 't do that . Dermatos stamos kythreaks . He needs good Tauron stuff . Now go . Just look after him , okay ? This is stellar . I 'm glad you could come out and get a minute to come here . Well , for you , I 'd skip lunch every day . I 'd get all scrawny , but beauty of V-World ... you wouldn 't have to know . I bet you wonder what I really look like , don 't you ? Nope . It doesn 't matter . I like you no matter what , because I love your brain . You are such a liar . No , I 'm serious . You 're the smartest person I know , and that 's ... that 's , like , the most beautiful thing . Remember what you were saying about generative processes ? Genius . It helped me a lot at work . Yeah , I just meant that if your robot could learn more if it was exposed to more environments . Well , you 're probably right , but I don 't think anyone 's gonna let me take it out for a walk . In fact , if this thing I 'm trying now doesn 't work out , I 'm not really sure what 's gonna happen to it . Oh , I smudged your glasses . And I 'm furious about it . Barnabas , it 's Lacy . It 's done . Good girl . Daniel , Colonel Sasha Patel from military procurement to see you . And here is where it all began . The Holoband and the MCP ? Uh , no , but , actually , this is where I first integrated the chip with the chassis and the U-87 became active . Remarkable . I guess you could almost say this is the birthplace of artificial life . Almost . And that life continues to mature . We 've made remarkable strides with the prototype . It exceeds the contract 's specs in every performance category . It 's a remarkable piece of hardware , Dr. Graystone . - Thank you ... Daniel , please . - Oh , Daniel ! Call me Daniel . The problem is you still just have one . Well , that 's because we decided to optimize the chip before we copied it and integrated it into other robots . I assure you , we are right on schedule for our delivery date next month ... 100,000 robots , as promised . I suppose we should have anticipated this . Anticipated what ? The difficulties of reverse engineering stolen technology . I don 't know where you get your information , Colonel , - but I assure you ... - Please . .. that 's not what happened . Defense may have turned a blind eye , but down in procurement , we knew what we were getting into . The problem is the potential for political embarrassment increases the longer this thing drags on without results . So we 're moving your deadline up to the 7th . That 's next week . Well , I think we both know that if you can 't get it done by then , you just can 't do it . Daniel . SK-1 to control , we 're losing our visual . Heavy natural cover , due to the higher altitude . I knew if I left it on long enough , you 'd come check it out . Like a kitten and a laser pointer . Get out of my house ! Not really yours , is it ? It 's a virtual , like you . Nothing 's real here , not even my pretty face . What is that doing here ? Who are you ? Relax . I 'm a friend of your father 's . He 's been in here looking for you . Did you know that ? And what do you care ? I need you to help me with him . At first , I thought it might be better to let him find you , but this is not better . I don 't believe you . It 's true . He missed his own son 's ink day . He 's using amp . He 's lost . Tamara , he needs your help . Well , he 's real . I 'm a ghost . What do you think we can do to help him ? Since we know that our problem 's replicating the MCP stem from these , uh , generative anomalies in the chip 's code , I started thinking about building a kind of , uh , psych profile for the U-87 . It may take a couple of weeks , - but we could use it to , uh , tag and preserve ... - Psych profile ? Yeah , all the anomalies allowing us to create a clean copy of the chip that we could use as a template to mass-produce it . No , no , let me tell you what we 're going to do . We 're going to treat those anomalies of yours like a cancer . We 'll irradiate the chip and burn them off . And then we 'll take the original MCP and use that as a template and start cranking out new copies tomorrow , all right ? But we 'd be destroying the original in the process , along with everything that makes this prototype distinctive , everything that ... that makes it ... What , unique ? A nifty poker player ? Sweet Aphrodite , I don 't know why I 've put up with your crap for so long . It is a robot , Doctor . It 's not a pet , and it 's definitely not a person . It 's a robot . It 's no different than your fancy cell phone . And right now I don 't need a cell phone that will check my mail and wipe my ass ! I need a cell phone that works ! Now , if you want a job to come back to tomorrow , you will burn the chip clean , understood ? - Yes , sir . - Thank you . No , tonight . Philo 's unlocking the door at 10 : 00 tonight , and he 's expecting to see me ... well , Rachel , for the robot-watching tour . But it 's not gonna be me . It 's gonna be you . And you 're gonna tell him that this is what you really look like and blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . - It can 't be tonight . - And then you know what ? You 're gonna stun-gun him . But please be gentle , all right ? Because he 's really a good boy . And then you 're gonna load me into the box ... And we can do that . We just have to wait , that 's all . A week probably . I don 't have a week . I don 't have a day . Damn it , Lacy , I knew you 'd be frakking something up ! There 's nothing I can do ! You 're doing the same thing that you did to original Zoe ! That 's not fair ! No , you know what ? Guess what ? They 're gonna make copies of my chip , Lace . And the way they do that is they have to destroy the original , which is me , okay ? They 're not doing it later . They 're doing it now . And maybe that isn 't even real to you , because I don 't even seem real to you , but I am . Inside of here , I am real . I know . I know that . They 're pulling me back in the robot , Lacy . - Please , don 't let it happen to me ! - Zoe ! Zoe , I 'm sorry ! Don 't you look nice ? I thought we were going out . My love , why go out when we can put some of my little-used culinary skills to work ? Here ... Sit . Almost . I had to make some hard choices today , choices I probably should have made a long time ago , but ... Now , I finally feel like things are getting on the right track . Do you remember how I ... was when we first met ? Oh , a little ... a little wild . A little crazy , actually . But it was hard to be crazy around you . Somehow you repelled it . You were always so sane . I could always count on you to be you . Well , I find it hard to be anyone else , really . Daniel , Vergis told me that you stole his chip - and killed two of his employees . - I 'm sorry ... Vergis told you ... ? What ? When did he tell you ? Where was I ? You were out . He came by . Here ? Yes . The stones on that guy . Tell me it isn 't true . Well ... It 's ... it 's complicated . Hello ? I was told to come here . I hear you . Who 's there ? Step into the light . Daddy . Tammy . It 's you . Oh , baby . Oh , thank the gods ! Thank Jupiter . I prayed . Dad ... I don 't want you following me anymore . This place is bad for you . No , baby , I just found you . You 're killing yourself with that stuff . What , the amp ? - Okay , no more . - You 're wasting your life . I don 't want you watching me , because if that 's all you do , that 's all you 'll ever do . - Baby . - I 'm sorry . Tammy . Ah ! No ! I love you , dad . Hey . She 's gone . It 's okay . She 's really gone . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . I 'm really sorry about this . Look , I know you can 't understand what I 'm saying . Like Dr. Graystone says ... You 're not really a person . Stop . Please . Philo , it 's me , the robot . And I 'm Rachel too . You said you didn 't really care what I looked like in the real world . I 'm not really a robot , okay ? I 'm not just a robot . I 'm Zoe Graystone , and I am trapped in here . My father put me in this body after I died , okay ? - Help ! Help ! Dr. Graystone ! - And I can get to Gemenon if you help me . Philo , don 't do this right now , okay ? Help me ! I need to escape . My friend let me down , and my father tried to hurt me , okay ? You 're the only one that cares about me right now . Please ... I need you . I told you it didn 't matter what you looked like ... and it doesn 't . Thank you . Take me to the truck . Stash me there until they open the ports back up again and put me in a box and ship me to Gemenon . There are people there that know what my purpose really is . - Okay ? - Okay . No ! You have no idea what it means to build something or to work hard for anything ! It 's all just been handed to you , Zoe ! Military says it 's about 200 klicks northwest of here . They 're setting up a roadblock now . Poor kid . It 's designed to defend itself . Whatever Philomon was doing , it must have perceived a threat . I always knew it had sentience . It doesn 't ... it doesn 't mean anything else . What else would it mean ? Just make sure none of those trigger-happy grunts cut loose on it , all right ? We need it back in one piece . What ? What ? They 're saying this incident proves we 've lost control of the project . I 'm not sure we 're getting it back . Who is saying that ? It 's coming from the top brass . If they had any idea ... what this chip has cost me . You don 't like me much , Sasha . But you 're willing to break bread with me if it serves your purpose . Thank you for a lovely evening , Mr. Vergis . Wow , even a Tauron gets fancy " thank-you " s when he promises robots that work and a share of civilian applications . You get the company , you get the contract . Guaranteed . Uh , sure I can 't drop you ? No , thanks . - Protect yourself . - Oh , why , thank you . Good evening , Tomas . Good evening . I took you out of a virtual playground and brought you into the real world ! But I guess you couldn 't handle it , huh ? It 's not a pet , and it 's definitely not a person . Oh , God ! Zoe ! Zoe ! I 'm sorry ! Barnabas , I can 't wait any longer . I 've got to go now ! - Lacy , you shouldn 't be here . No , let her stay . - Barnabas . - She wanted to serve the cause , let her see how well she served it . How is the sister ? Approaching a light on State and Harbor . They must be headed to the spaceport for their little flight to Gemenon . Ah , well , it 's gonna be a shorter trip than she realizes . - You put a bomb in her car . - No ... You did , actually . Sorry about the seats . I mean , we were lucky to get a flight . The GDD alert , you know ... Everything 's booked . The key 's the key , Lacy . It now contains a digital relay linked to a cell number . A phone call will cause it to detonate a very large bomb in the trunk . They 'll probably decide she was a terrorist ... back when she was in one piece instead of , you know , thin jelly . Your boyfriend designed it . He 's a young man of many useful talents . So ... this is what the S.T.O. wanted ... to kill Sister Clarice . No , it 's what I wanted . But as far as you 're concerned , I am the S.T.O. leadership . Then you both used me . Welcome to the deep-end , little one . It 's always deeper than you think . SK-1 to control , suspect vehicle is headed right for the roadblock . Copy , SK-1 . Alpha Company , van now four klicks from your position , approaching at high speed . Use of force authorized to disable vehicle only . Do not harm the prototype . Roger that . Nice and tight ! Okay , good . Alpha Company in position . Ready . What is it ? I 've lost the GPS signal . I can 't get any input from the stoplight cameras . Frakkin ' technology . Place is gonna be jammed with people trying to get Off-World . I don 't care . I just want to shut that little bastard down . I just hope we get the sanction to terminate him personally . Hold your fire ! This is Alpha Company . We have contact . Hold position ! Should we approach ? Negative , negative . No movement . Got it . Oh , the Pantheon Bridge . There they are . Gotcha . Keon ... You don 't have to do this . It 's okay . This is your moment . You want to be a terrorist ? Let 's see some terror . Do it ... or you can forget about getting your shipment to Gemenon . In fact , you can forget about the rest of your life , 'cause it 'll end right here ... along with his . Yeah ? Someone is gonna die today , little girl . You choose . Oh , my God ! Two of my employees were murdered . It 's complicated . Seeing my dead brother ... dead brother . I lost my mind . It 's complicated . Take cover ! Move ! Oh , my God ! Kaboom . This is Graystone .

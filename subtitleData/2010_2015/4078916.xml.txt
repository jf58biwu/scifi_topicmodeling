 Help me . Let me out . Let me .. let me out . Let me out ! Open the door ! Ah ! H1N1 trial 0697 . Approximate time of death : 0200 hours . From initial exposure until full onset of symptoms , confirm ... 22 days , six.plus hours . Still too slow . You have to be reasonable , Mrs. Herring . This strain 's the most efficient one yet . 23 days is a lifetime , Doctor . What I need is panic .. instant panic . Anything the matter ? If it 's a question of funding , I 'm sure others would find my compensation more than fair . . We 'll need another trial subject . . Done . We need to expand the lab team .. more hands . Whatever you need will be provided . Make me a plague , Doctor . Malcolm S. Burr ? Age 29 ; BS Biological Science , Hopkins 2003 ; dual degree .. MD.PhD 2007 , specializing in cytological abnormality and pathology . Could say I spent enough time in school to earn my tenure . Um , of course , that 's not to say I don 't have plenty of field experience . If you read on , you 'll notice my lab work in Mendoza , Argentina . I was part of a social program treating the infectious agents in the livestock . Our team was actually one of the first to identify the native H1N1 strain on the molecular .. Do you know what we do here , Dr. Burr ? As far as I 'm aware , sir , you 're synthesizing an H1N1 vaccine . . You 're the good guys . . We 're hired hands . We do what we 're told , what we 're paid to do . Well , what you 're doing here is very noble , Doctor . I 've been on this project now for almost a year . This is grim , ugly medicine .. nothing noble about it . With this record , you could go anywhere . The industry is starving for young cell doctors like yourself . With all due respect , Dr. Gravamen , I 've seen this disease at its worst . And maybe I could have gone somewhere else or done something else , but .. but I need to be here , Dr. Gravamen . Late night for a ... big bad wolf to be out all alone . Looking for a little love , Wolfie ? You know , Daddy says I shouldn 't talk to strangers . Then again , I got a lot of daddies . Hello ? You shy or what ? Where am I ? Who are you ? Please . My mother will wonder where I am , please . . Oh . Good morning . . Morning . Sorry , you startled me . I 'm usually the first one here , even before the doctor . Well , I thought I 'd get a head start . . I couldn 't sleep anyway . . First day ? Am I that obvious ? Um , just a little polished . Meaning ? Well , the suit . I mean , unless you intend on reading a eulogy later , you might want to tone it down a little bit . Been around here since the beginning , when Mrs. Herring first commissioned the project after the outbreak . I found it comforting to know that benefactors were taking an interest in public health , not just for profit but for the greater good . How 's the progress been going ? Slow.moving but steady . You know , H1N1 takes so many forms that it 's hard to predict what 's next . to form appropriate vaccines . . Yeah . But we try . You know , we all try . And Dr. Gravamen is a great man , you know ? So I 've heard . It 's like what do we got to do to be appreciated ? As much time as I spend in this lab looking at microbes , you 'd think by now I 'd have antenna growing out of my fucking ears . Kenny , give it a rest . No one wants to hear your whining in the morning . Ha . What do you got to show for it , sunshine ? Getting up every day at 5 : 00 AM . 'Cause all I got is a savings account that 's dwindling almost as fast as this chair rash that 's growing on my ass . Ugh ! No one wants to hear that . Do you ? 'Cause I don 't . Oh , the biotech money to be made in the private sector . I hear you , pal . I could finally get that Audi coupe I 've been looking at . You the new guy , the MD ? Appears so . Um , Malcolm Burr . . Kenny Welchman . . Pleasure . Never mind Francis . He 's just upset that his parents named him Francis . I see you met our little tech Abby . And , um , that 's Cori . Try not to listen to her . She 's a product of public school . . Morning , staff . . Good morning , Doctor . . Doctor . . Nice to see you awake . Dr. Burr , once you 've changed , if you 'd be so kind . Of course . As you know , after its initial outbreak in South America , the native H1N1 virus has been largely contained . Minus a body count well over 1,000 . Fair enough . But rather than using native H1N1 , we focus our research on viral variants . Human adapted strains . . You 're mutating the virus yourselves ? . Precisely . To provide vaccine before a more deadly strain emerges . But predicting the random mutation of a hostile virus .. There 's only a limited number of ways the virus can adapt to recognize human receptors . We presuppose those mutations . ln synthesizing these variants in a controlled environment , we generate vaccine stocks against possible viral mutation . Contrary to what you may believe , the most vicious H1N1 outbreak has yet to occur . And when it does ... we 'll have the solution . Hey ! Anybody there ? Hello ? Can anybody hear me ? Anybody ? Look , I 'm sorry for whatever I did . Just .. just let me out . Hello ! Trial 0698 : female subject , approximately 1 25 lbs , sexually active . Barring psychological profile , remains in good health . Treatment yet to be decided . My God . This morning I was stocking the database , observing recently manipulated mutant samples . I came across an H1N1 version X fresh off the gene.therapy assembly line . And ? And ? Well ... let 's just say that in all my time in South America , I never saw anything move this fast . I mean , that virus was deadly , but this .. this .. It swallowed an entire host of T.cells right before my eyes in real time . A strain resistant to even the most potent antivirals . . Version X ? . It got me thinking : what if .. what if in our effort to predetermine H1N1 's mutant variants , we create a strain that we can 't control ? We 've been over this . Your job here is to enact our methods , . not question them . . Yes yes ! . But what if .. . What if what ? We have strict security measures .. a lockdown if necessary . I 'm just saying maybe we should look over those security measures . . Double.check the inventories .. . Burr ! Your concerns have been noted , but already taken into account . Of course , sir . I don 't know what I was thinking . Don 't get any ideas , Doctor . A conscience is one thing a scientist cannot afford . Jerron ? Yes , Doctor ? I think we 've found what we 've been looking for . Yes , Doctor . Who 's that ? Just someone I used to know . During your work abroad ? Yeah . She was one of the first to get it bad . When we admitted her , we didn 't .. we had no idea what was wrong . We thought it was the common flu . One day she was walking around with a baby girl ... the next she was flat on her back . Even through residency , I .. it was the first time I 'd ever seen anyone die . I 'm sorry . It 's .. the photo 's just a reminder , you know , of who we 're trying to help . What 's at stake . Yeah . Come on . Let 's get some food , huh ? Trial 0698 , continuous . Administered sample : version X , virus H1N1 . Hello ? What 's going on ? Who are you ? What are you .. what are you doing ? Stop ! No don 't ! No no ! Please don 't hurt me . No ! No ! No , please don 't hurt me . Please don 't hurt .. ah ! Trial 0698 . Administered sample : version X , virus H1N1 . Treatment successful . Approximate time of first contact and infection : 1900 hours . Based on the observed virus spread , estimated life expectancy : three days . Get her off me ! No no no . No no no ! Don 't ! Jerron , subdue the patient at all costs . Do you hear me ? At all costs . Jerron , that duct leads into the main lab . She 's entering the lab . . See , look . Look . . God , you 're foul . Do you know how many germs you just put back in there ? . That 's disgusting . . Go on , finish your story . She 's in the lab . I 'm taking somebody home tonight even if I have to use a U.Haul. You know what I mean ? Like she 's gotta .. It 's not funny . It 's wrong . You gotta eat what 's on your plate . I 'm not gonna starve or go home by myself . What the fuck ? You gotta help me . You gotta help me ! . He 's coming . . Hey . Hey , calm down . . What 's wrong ? . He 's coming . . Who 's coming ? What 's wrong ? . He 's coming ! . Who 's .. . You have to hide me . . Please hide me . . Hide you from who ? . Calm down . Who 's coming ? . Please hide me . Subject has just entered the staff lounge . . You have to hide me , please . . Hide you from who ? . Tell us what is going on . . What 's wrong ? . Please ! . Who 's coming ? Ah ! Stay the fuck away from me ! . Stay away from me . . Who the hell are you ? Stay the fuck away ! Please help me ! . Fuck me . . Oh God . Oh shit . What have you done ? What have you done ? Malcolm , don 't . . Oh my God . . Oh shit . Jerron , leave them and come back here at once . At once ! Yes , Doctor . Doctor ? Oh my fucking God . I don 't understand . Herring residence . Gravamen for Mrs. Herring . Yes . One moment , Doctor . What is it ? Mrs. Herring , there 's been an accident . She 's infected . Oh shit . Listen , Doctor , if you can 't contain your patient that 's your own fault . These consequences are on you . I assume full responsibility . Now we 've already lost one trial subject , but there is a silver lining . We 've gained your staff . If the sample is as strong as you suggest , we 'll soon be rid of the problem anyway . Accidents do happen . You know what you must do . It 'll be taken care of . I grow tired of shortcomings , Doctor . Now please , I must get back to my guests . God forgive me . What the hell 's that ? What the hell is that ? What 's going on ? . They 're shutting us in . . The lab 's locking down . We gotta get out of here ! . We can 't just leave her . . Then you fucking stay . . Come on , come on ! . Abby , come on ! Please , Abby . Please . We 're in here ! We 're in here ! Come on ! Which way , Abby ? Abby , where 's the exit ? Malcolm , we 've .. we 've tested the lockdown . Fuck ! We 're in here ! You gotta let us out . It 's secure , Malcolm . There 's no way out . No . Trial continuous .. administered sample : version X , virus H1N1 . Estimated life expectancy : three days . . It 's too tight . . Okay . . Yeah . . There . Okay . Guys , I don 't feel right . I mean , I 'm really cold but I can 't stop sweating . Kenny , will you pass her the blanket ? Yeah . . Ready ? . Mm.hmm. Doctor ? Doctor , are you there ? Can you hear me ? It 's Vox . Doctor , I know you 're there . Get rid of him . Respond . Jerron . Jerron , I need to speak to Dr. Gravamen . I 'm sorry , Dr. Vox . The good doctor is indisposed at the moment . All right then . Whatever the hell that means . Look , I need you to get me out of here . Just open the lab doors long enough for me to sneak out . Whatever the hell you guys have planned , I don 't need to be a part of it . Just as long as I 'm taken care of . Regretfully , Mrs. Herring has no plans of opening the lockdown . Plans ? Fuck her plans ! You tell Mrs. Herring that I 'm in here . She 'll listen to you . Tell her whatever she paid me , I 'll give it back . You just tell her . Mrs. Herring is extremely appreciative of your sacrifice , Dr. Vox . My sacrifice ? You listen , you cold.blooded asshole . This is your fault , not mine ! I 'm an asset . I 'm dependable . I am the eyes and ears in here looking out for that bitch 's affairs , not you ! You 're just the hired guns coming in blazing . Now you get those doors open . I apologize , Dr. Vox , but this transmission is over . Jerron ? Jerron ! Jerron ? Fuck . Fuck . Fuck . Jerron ! Okay , you 're done . You 're next . No way , Burr . Nobody 's pricking me with anything . I feel fine . Fuckin ' aces . How 's it look ? . Anything ? . Nada . Not a damn thing . Wireless is dead too . CPUs just keep roving and roving . The shutdown scrambled the system . All the outside lines are dead . It is so cold in here . Jesus . Give me good news , Burr . Tell me these shakes I got are just my nerves . Sorry . What 's the damage ? After analyzing our blood samples , I have to conclude that we 've all been infected with a particularly aggressive viral mutation . The same strain of H1N1 I observed the other day . Oh shit . How nasty is it ? It 's fast , both airborne and blood.borne. Though minus the sample from Francis , it 's already in our blood .. all of us , mutating . Christ Almighty . How long do we have ? I can 't be sure . But according to my observational report , a healthy human host has approximately ... three days . Five at most . We 're fucked . We 're all fucked . No . No we 're not . We 're not . I mean , come on . There 's got to be something that we can do . I mean , we 've been working on these vaccines for all of these strands from the very beginning . Right ? Right ? We have speculative antivirals . We have high.dose inhaler cocktails that can stop the on.spread. Um , we empty out the fridges . We use everything we have to formulate a proper vaccine . I just wish we could get in touch with the doctor . I wish there was some way .. What the hell is wrong with you all ? Dr. Gravamen would know what to do . He always knew what to do . Open your eyes ! Those doors are closed . Nobody is coming for us . Not Gravamen , not anyone ! We 're in here alone . Maybe . Maybe not . The girl . What about her ? She must have come out of some rabbit hole , right ? Start pumping the antivirals . Test any vaccine we 've got . I 'm gonna crawl through and see what I can find . No no , I don 't like this . There 've already been too many surprises . I think we should stick together . We shouldn 't separate . I 'll go with you . Ladies first . Please , after you . They 'll tell them everything , Doctor . Doesn 't matter . Hmm . Cruel to let the rats run the maze when there is only dead ends . Must be an auxiliary lab . You ever seen it before ? No . My God . Malcolm , don 't . Is he alive ? Cardiac repression , uh , blood loss , shock . Been dead about six to eight hours . Help . Help me . I need a fluid iv and an injection of antivirals , STAT ! Move it , people ! Move ! . What 's wrong with him ? . He 's infected . We starting a club ? We 're all fuckin ' infected . No idea how long he 's been alone without food or water in isolation . Where 's that shot , Abby ? . Where 's that shot ? . Coming up . . Hold him ! . Shit ! Shit ! Oh my God ! The vaccine .. vaccine . The vaccine ? Find the doctor .. Gravamen . Gravamen ! . Jesus Christ . . It can 't be . No . No no no ! Help me stabilize him ! . Shit ! . Help me stabilize him ! Hold him down ! Oh God . You got another one of those ? Countless .. countless hours of research . And all thinking that we 're working for some better good . If Gravamen has had a vaccine , what have we been doing here this whole time ? You can 't believe what that guy said . It could have been brain aneurysms or shock . It must be nice living in the dark , Abby . Face it , Gravamen 's out there just counting the time . Waiting for us to rot . We have more control than you may think . The virus isn 't in the streets . It 's not in the cities or the countryside . It 's in here .. it 's in you ; it 's in me ; it 's in all of us . . Spit it out , Burr . . The virus is a weapon . Like nothing I 've ever seen . And personally , I 'm not ready to lie down and allow a worldwide pandemic . We burn this place from the inside . . What ? . Shit , Burr . Burn down the lab ? You 're losing your fucking mind . There 's more than enough combustibles here to do it . It is absolutely feasible . Oh yeah ! It 's fuckin ' genius . Why don 't we all just kill ourselves ? With none of the antivirals taking effect , we 're already living on borrowed time . We do this now .. make it right . No . If Gravamen 's got a vaccine , maybe there 's a chance . All we have to do .. Don 't you understand ? It doesn 't matter what Gravamen has ! He 's out there and we 're in here . He 's out there and we 're in here . What ? . He 's out there ... . What ? What is it ? ... and we 're in here . He 's out there and we 're in here . Yeah , I heard you . I knew it was just a matter of time before we all went a little batshit crazy . The lockdown happened immediately without any relay . Where was Gravamen ? How did he know ? . What are you saying ? . He 's watching us . Here . An eye in the sky . No , can 't be . He put cameras in the wall ? Sick motherfucker ! You see me Gravamen ? ! You see this ? You sick motherfucker . Francis ! Francis ! Francis . . Get off me ! . It 's all right . Get off me ! Get off me ! Blow it out your ass , fucking Welchman ! Get off me ! As for the rest of you , do whatever you want . You can suck Malcolm 's shoes for all I care . Just count me out . Fuckin ' idiots . They want to give up and set themselves on fire . ldiots ! Doctor ? Are you there ? Can you hear me ? I picture you watching me , but it just doesn 't make sense . You were always so kind . A kindness you can see in the eyes . It 's my sister 's birthday this week . She 's turning 18 . She 's supposed to come visit me , maybe look at campuses . I haven 't even thought about her . I talk about you with my family , you know ? All the work we 're doing . They keep asking me to move home . I tell them , " No no . " " The doctor needs me . I 'm making a difference . " Abby ? Oh . Oh , I 'm sorry . I usually don 't do this . It 's just .. I just thought he was a good man . I just feel so stupid . You didn 't do anything wrong , Abby . I trusted him . We all did . He fooled every one of us . Right now we have to do what 's right . Malcolm . I don 't want to die . What is it ... about a person 's mechanics that makes them so desperate when cornered ? So dramatically unpredictable ? That 's what pleases me about you ... Doctor . You .. you are reliable . I believe I admire that . Little help . We don 't need no water . Let the motherfucker burn . This should be enough fireworks . This is flammable . Kenny , what are we doing ? Look at this . You tell me we 're doing the right thing , Kenny . The right thing ? I don 't know what the right thing is . This is something . Gravamen 's watching us , right ? So he 's not going to let us burn this place down .. all the work we 've done . He 's gonna see this , he 's gonna open the doors and we 're gonna be out of here , okay ? I 'm getting out of here . You 're coming with me . Yeah . I don 't want to be here . Kenny , I want to go home . I don 't want to go out like this . This is insane . You look like shit . Stupid . It 'll be okay . Gravamen ! Gravamen ! Gravamen ! I should have known you were watching us . Are you paranoid ? You should be , you stupid bastard . All the nooks and crannies in this bunker .. they 're perfect for your secrets . Secrets I helped you hide ! I see you . You know I never liked you . Something about those beady little eyes . And I knew .. I knew that this was gonna be bad . What are you doing , Doctor ? And those fucking idealists in there .. Malcolm , fucking Abby . They don 't account for scumbags like you and me . But you got me . You got me ! That says something . Now I 'm talking to ghosts . Gravamen ! Fascinating . Gravamen ! Cori ? Gravamen ! It 's too late ! Gravamen ! Oh my God . Cori . Listen , hang on . No . I 'm sorry , man . Stay with me , Francis ! No , baby . Please , no . Oh God , Francis . Hold on , Francis . Come on , Francis . It 's faster , Abby . It 's faster than I thought . Oh God . Oh no . Doctor ? Yes ? Madame ? Ah , good morning , Jerron , my most loyal compatriot . How 's my little experiment coming along ? Progressing very well , Madame . There have been five casualties already . Five ? So fast . Gravamen and his worker bees have outdone themselves . By the look of the others , we may expect a complete body count in the coming days . Ah . Excellent , Jerron . That 's excellent news on an excellent morning . But there has been a complication . lsn 't there always ? The karma of good news and its backlash . It appears the good doctor has surprised me , deviating from his typical behavioral pattern . Gravamen . What headache has he cooked up for me now ? He has taken it upon himself to override the lockdown , Madame . He what ? He is in the lab . Jerron , listen very carefully . With a virus strain this fast and effective , the work is done . Gravamen and any others are immediately expendable . I give you full warrant to dispatch of them any way possible . Don 't let anyone out of that lab , Jerron . You understand ? Of course , Madame . Kenny . No . You son of a bitch , you let them die ! Same as pulling a trigger or dragging a knife across our throats . . She had a plan , Malcolm . . Who had a plan ? Danita Herring , my benefactor . You think I wanted this ? . I 'm just a doctor . . Bullshit . . What about the girl ? . Just a trial subject . Trial subject ? A guinea pig . I 'm just doing what I was told , what I was paid to do . I hope you were paid well . You pig . Years ago , after H1N1 first hit , I developed an angel antidote .. an inhibitor that not only stopped the production of the virus , but also caused it to literally destroy itself . But the epidemic had slowed , so she commissioned me to mutate the virus into something uncontrollable .. fast , a horror . A horror you were going to unleash on the public ! Danita wanted the world desperate . She wanted them terrified , frenzied . She would be hailed as a savior . She would be a hero . She 'd make millions . Billions , Malcolm , billions . So that 's what we 've been doing . That 's what we 've been doing this entire time . We 're nothing but pawns for a rich woman 's sick scheme . I 'm sorry , Abby . I 'm so sorry . Don 't you dare . You used us . I found myself doing things . I heard myself saying things . I 'm weak . I couldn 't watch you , Abby , suffering . The antidote , where is it ? She keeps it in a medical facility not more than 10 miles from here . So we still have time . We release the antidote before Herring has a chance to unleash it on the world . How can we trust what he says ? Good God in heaven . Hey , Doc . So nice you could join the party . How rude of me . It 's not like we have a choice . Ah ah ah ah . Oh no . Will he listen to you ? Hardly . He 's Herring 's wind.up toy . Tsk tsk , Doctor . You disappointed your employer . Step aside , Jerron . Herring 's already got what she needs . The virus is already as strong and deadly as it will ever be . Where are you running off to then ? Making trouble ? There 's no need for anyone else to die , Jerron . On the contrary , Doctor . You are as expendable as all the others . I 'm not afraid of you , Jerron . I know what you are . Do you ? I wonder at times when I watch you what makes you act . What it feels like to hurt . To know death is close . Rattling . So delicate , so fragile , your bodies ... your sex ... quivering , rotting . Don 't touch her ! Malcolm . ln a way , I believe I envy you . You sense your end , your mortality . At this moment you were never more alive on the eve of death . You 're not .. you 're not human . Sadly . Pity , isn 't it , Doctor ? ln death , they 're not so colorful . Just do it . Do it already . Ahh ! I believe I envy you . So vulnerable . So fragile . At this moment ... you are in the moment . You were never more alive . You sense your end , your mortality . Mortality . I see it when I watch you . What it feels like to hurt . To know death is close . Rattling . Danita Herring . How 'd you get in here ? We found your little stash , Mrs. Herring . Who are you ? Gravamen 's vaccine works wonders . ln the right hands , it 's worth a fortune . Do I know you ? No . No , you don 't . But we know you . Where am I ? Let me out of here . I demand you let me out of here at once . What do you want ? I 'll give you anything . No . No . You can 't do this to me ! Please . Please please . Please please . Please . You can 't .

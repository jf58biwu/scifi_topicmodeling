 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Knock , knock . You 're going with Myka as a backup . My first official assignment as an Agent ? As ... An Apprentice . I 'm ready to begin my Apprentice education . You want juice , or are you a milk person ? You know what I 'd really like ? Oh I do indeed . But falling off the wagon , may not be the best option at this point . No , no , what ? We 're just asking because we 're worried about you . I 'm not drinking . How do we not end up with our brains scrambled or whatever new way to die there could be ? Well , I mean , look at the bright side . I 'm usually within ten feet of you , so whatever terrible thing happens to you , will probably happen to me too . Comforting . [ Both panting ] What is this guy , a jewel thief or a marathoner ? If the artifact let the thief walk into a jewelry store and vanish , then why isn 't he vanishing now ? Maybe he can 't activate it on the run , or maybe it doesn 't do what Artie thinks it does . [ Cell phone rings ] That 's Kelly . I told her I 'd call to discuss the weekend . I totally forgot . Whoa . Hello . Ah , careful , just don 't damage the one thing that Kelly 's looking forward to . Nah , little Pete 's made of steel . You go right , I 'll go left . Leena , this one is ready to be shelved . A tin of sardines ? Yes , it was part of the Shackleton Expedition . They were trapped in the ice , you know , for two years . They still had the good sense not to open that . Had the sardines gone bad ? Very bad . [ Computer beeping ] Artie , I-I just found an anomaly . Uh , survey says that insurance V.P.s in Hartford are donating big bucks to charity , and it doesn 't compute . It 's not an anomaly . It 's a tax write-off . Yeah , but these guys gave away 50 % of their bank accounts . I mean , the most they donated before is 1 % . That 's a difference of 49- - I can subtract 1 from 50 . That 's why you 're the boss . Hartford . Artie , Artie , that could be a Robin Hood artifact . Yes , it could . And the prize for finding a case is a spin around the Warehouse in Steve McQueen 's motorbike ? No , but try a free trip to Hartford , because Pete and Myka are on the trail of a vanishing jewel thief in Denver . So you and I will do this investigation . You and I ? Really ? Yeah . Well , I mean , I haven 't had a lot of time in the field , and you 're- - I 'm what ? Uh , nothing . That was the end of my sentence . Pack , ' cause we 're leaving right away . Where are my sunglasses ? [ Sighs ] This is why I pimped your specs . Just tap the ends of the glasses together to complete the circuit . [ Beeping ] Oh . [ Beeping continues ] Ha . [ Chuckles ] Brava . That is , uh , very well done . Well , we 're a team . Claudia and Artie . " Clartie . " " Artia " ? Pack . Yeah . [ Groaning ] Pete ! I got the bag ! You get him ! [ Groans ] Secret Service ! What happened ? Asian guy ... Went out that window . What is with this guy and windows ? Hey . Are you all right ? Hey , Pete , this way ! [ groans ] Got it covered . Whoa . Oh , ow . Oh , ow . Ow , ow , ow , ow . Ow , further than I thought . We lost him . Ow , but I bet we got the artifact . Well , let 's take a look at it , then . Jeez , where 's the drummer and the fife ? I just hurt my knee , okay ? And my shoulder . And I 'm probably gonna have a huge bruise on my- - what is that ? That is the world 's smallest purple violin . Oh . You know , one day you 're gonna make some lucky guy a very sarcastic wife . Ah . Half lion , half eagle . A Griffin . I know . Well , did you know that in Chinese Mythology they were used to guard treasure ? But somehow this one helps people steal treasure and then make a clean getaway . Oh , hey , speaking of , now that the mission is accomplished , you can go to your High-School Reunion and see some of your old friends . [ Both cheer sarcastically ] You did--you did have friends in High School , right ? Oh , as a matter of fact , Kurt Smoller , who is the Captain of the football team , emailed me and invited me personally . Wow , you and a football Captain , huh ? Yeah , yeah , we hung out . Okay , I tutored him in math . [ Chuckles ] Well , that 's perfect . Now you can go back and show big , fat Kurt Smoller that smart girls grow up pretty . Fine , I will go . Excellent .

Yeah , it 's a good thing , if you did it of your own free will , but I get a feeling that your wife wasn 't too thrilled with that decision . Well , what makes you think that ? Okay , she was upset with my sudden generosity , but that 's because she didn 't understand why I did it . Why did you do it ? I don 't have to answer to you or my wife . Is there another woman ? No . There 's only one woman for me . Okay . Claudia , I think that we could be dealing with a home-wrecking artifact . Two of the V.P.s have filed for divorce . Oh , make that three .

Because look , on each receipt , apple moto . Are any of these Truehart executives not affected ? John Donley . Oh , wait . Oh , pickles ! That was just him with teri . We should go warn him . No , no , no , we should track him , 'cause he could be the mojito drinker . See if you can hack into the garage cameras- - Hey , Teri . John say where he was headed ?

Artie , I just found something huge . What rhymes with " adorable " ? Deplorable . No . More--more able to- - passionate . Stop writing poetry . No , I can 't stop . Hey , I need your brain . I just found out Lauren 's brother died six months ago of liver disease . His request for a transplant was denied by his insurance . Do you want to guess who the provider was ? Truehart . Yes . So it was a revenge thing . And who can blame her ? We can ! No . Apparently the money 's not enough . She wants their lives . You know , when I see her , I 'll ask her to stop wanting their lives , and she 'll do it because she 's sweet . Holy gams , Batman , that 's how she 's doing it . " Rangel " ? Artie , look at this . You touched Lauren 's leg . John Donley touched it too . I think " adorable " is better . Look at that . Don 't show me another man groping my Lauren . Oh , that man 's in the hospital with five broken ribs , and you could be next . What can you tell me about Lauren 's leg ? That the only thing that stops it going on forever is the floor . Silky smooth and subtly soft . Ooh , I like " subtly soft . " Silky smooth . Ah , so maybe it 's a body cream that she 's using to turn men into stalkers . Stalker ... No . Would a stalker go to her house in the middle of the night to read her poetry ? Oh , Artie , you can 't go over there ... Without a shower . You 're all stinky from artifact hunting . Oh , yes , it has been a long day . Gamy , right ? Take a shower , yeah , but not a cold one . Well , Leena 's looking into it , but what do we do in the meantime ? Let 's go over the Griffin . There could be something . All right . Just- - a metal flap . That 's it . Is it ? Yes . Yes , it means it 's--it 's a bookend and not a statue . And bookends come in pairs . And if there 's another one , the thief probably has it . He could be anywhere by now . No , uh , wait , Leena said that when she put the Griffin down it rotated . [ Gasps ] It--it looks like- - like it 's pointing , like--like a compass . Well , maybe it 'll lead us to its mate in some dualistic attraction . Come on , let 's hit the road . Oh , and could you change out of my dress ? I just bought that today . Jeez . [ Cell phone rings ] [ Gasps ] Oh , that 's--that 's Kelly . Oh , shoot . I said I 'd call her . Aha .

And , uh , so I want to make- - I want to make it up to you with this promise . What ? No promises . No , Myka . Myka , no promises . Uh , yes , let me- - let me get someplace private . Fresh as a Daisy and a little less formal and slightly slimming . And all you need is your hat . Ooh , good idea . All right- - what are you doing ? No , Claudia ! Knock , knock . Just like old times . Claudia ! It 's for your own protection , Artie . I 'm going to Lauren 's to do what Warehouse agents do- - get the artifact . If you hurt Lauren , I will hunt you down . Mm-hmm . Pwned . God , how can you stand this hair ? I just want to cut it off . You do that , and I will shave your entire body . Ugh . Use the hair tie . It 's on my right arm . So--I just thought it was an ugly bracelet . So what do--what do I do ? Turn . [ Sighs ] So what 'd you promise Kelly ? Well , you will find out . Oh , my God , your hands are so clumsy . Ow ! There . Look at that . What is it doing ? Hey . You have the other Griffin . You were right . There are two of ' em . Security guard . You and the thief were working together . Wrong again . We are together . And we 've been looking all over town for you . I really don 't like where this is going . I need the other Griffin now . No ! First you show us- - there 's no time . Myka , grab the Griffin . Whoa , I 'm me again . Myka , where are you ? I 'm back to myself . This just got easier . Wrong . He 's the nice one . So am I. Now we 're sharing one body too . Pete ? Pete , we have got to fix this . Yeah , tell me about it . Oh , hi . I work with Artie . Get out of here . No can do . Two men are in the hospital , and you 're still on the loose . That wasn 't my fault . I saw you hit John Donley with your car . That wasn 't me driving . Then who was it ? Me . Told you to get out of here . [ Groaning ] Sharing the same body now . Great . Should make Myka do this . [ Grunts ] Really ? Just when I could 've used the upper-body strength . [ Knock at door ] [ Breathing heavily ] Hey , you 're still up . Kurt . This is a really bad time for a Booty call . What makes you think it 's a Booty call ? Well , what else would it be ? Busted . Can I come in ? No , no , you can 't . And just believe me when I say it 's not you , it 's me . Myka , I promise , I just want to talk . The Lady said good night . Wait , Myka didn 't tell me she was involved . You went for it , man . That 's cool . Now get lost . Look , man , you really don 't have to do this . I 'm not after you . I 'm not taking any chances until Lauren and I are on that plane . What plane ? One that 's taking us far away , my love . I don 't want to go anywhere with you , Howard . You do . You 're just distracted by all these people . Is that why you handcuffed me ? I won 't allow any of these other men to steal you away . I 'm gonna go pack your bags , and then we 'll get out of here . I am so sorry . I had no idea these guys would turn violent . Yeah , well , just let me think about this for a minute . If Artie is a Federal Agent , won 't he come after you ? He would ... Except I kind of handcuffed him in his hotel room . Fastest-working karma ever . Karma . Yeah , that 's how this whole thing got started . I wanted that insurance company to pay back to others what they took from me . I never wanted anyone hurt . So how are you doing it ? I mean , it 's something to do with your legs , right ? Stockings . I don 't know why or how they work , but when men touch them , they 'll do anything I ask . Which is cool ... You know , until they become obsessed stalkers , and you can 't control them . Where are the stockings now ? On a rod in the bathroom . Oh . Right . Like I don 't know how to improvise an electromagnet . I was doing this when MacGyver was still trapped in his crib . Now come to papa . Ah . Oh , yes , come to papa . Yes , yes . Come , baby . Come , come , come . Yes . Okay . Okay . And this is only one of 23 ways that I could have escaped . [ Groans ] I don 't feel so good . We can help . Just tell us what to- - the Griffins . I got them . They 're right here . Quick- - this is bad . [ Groans ] Just tell us what to do . You ... Just ... [ Both groan , scream ] Oh . Oh , oh , oh . Oh , I sure wish he 'd ... Finished that sentence . All set . By this time tomorrow , we 'll be relaxing in a villa near Lisboa . And as for you ... Lauren , come on , say something . Howard , don 't hurt her . I have no choice . She would get between us . And I can 't allow anything to come between us . You ? You ? [ Groaning ] Lauren , are you all right ? Yes , but what did you do to him ? Temporary blindness . This is a shard from the lens of the Pharos Lighthouse , Alexandria . And there 's the Phoenix . Oh , so many things that I could show you . Artie , thank God . He was about to shoot me and- - Claudia . That prism was meant for you . She thought that she could outsmart me , but I 've got moves she 's never even dreamt of . We 're out of here . No , no , first unlock Claudia . Unlock the girl that tried to come between us ? Never . Let 's go . Leena , you 're out last hope . We just learned the hard way that two things can 't occupy the same space . Okay , I looked into split personalities , which led me to Robert Louis Stevenson , who wrote Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . Going through his notes , I found a picture of him in his study . Can we move this along ? I 'm starting to get a really ... Bad vibe . So that 's what vibes feel like . Huh . On the shelf behind him , there 's two bookends . Griffins ? No , one is an eagle . And the other is a lion . It seemed like such a coincidence- - maybe the bookends on the mantel are in an inactive state . What if the heads can be switched , and the duality ... Could be reversed ? We need to make the eagle and the lion whole again . I 'll call you back . Okay . It worked . All right . Come on , birdie . You 'll have to kill me . Nothing but a bullet will stop me from trying to be with Lauren . Artie , don 't . Lauren , go get the stockings , now ! I know exactly how you feel , Howard . Then you know I 'll follow her to the ends of the earth . As would I. Get on your knees . I 'll make it quick . Artie , stop this ! You 're not a cold-blooded killer ! Lauren ! Come on , little birdie . Got it . Oh , yeah , that 's ' cause I loosened it for you . Put the eagle head on the eagle . Okay . [ Both groaning ] Just get it over with . What do I do with them ? Put a run in them . Use your nails , anything . Then the lion head on the ... Oh , my God . Howard , are you okay ? I 'm not sure . My eyes hurt , ow . Oh , my God , I 've got to get home to my wife . That was too close . In so many ways . So I guess we can 't even pretend to be normal , huh ? Normal ... Not really in our wheelhouse . [ Chuckles ] Both : Good job . [ Laughs ] Hey , look , I found the artifact . Where did you get those ? My great-grandfather 's estate . More details . You turned several of us into blabbering fools . I 'd like to know how . Who was your great-grandfather ? He was a diplomat during World War I. They were in a box with a card . " Souviens-toi de moi , mon amour . " " Remember me , my love . " World War I ? Yeah . And the card- - was it signed " Margaretha " ? Yes . How did you know that ? Margaretha Zelle . Otherwise known as Mata Hari . The spy ? And a world-class seductress . There 's no way to tell whether they worked on her or she worked on them . Either way , they worked . I need to call the hospital , find out if John Donley 's okay . I hope he doesn 't have his company 's insurance . And " Clartie " saves the day . Kiddo , I want to thank you for focusing on your job and trying to protect me . Well , I learned from the master . You know , the keys are over there . From here , I can count eight ways that you can escape . Okay , look , I 'm really sorry I- - the spatula , make that nine . Claudia ... Knock , knock . Oh . Open . Then the thief walks into the jewelry store , right ? Asks the clerk to see something pricey . The clerk turns around . Poof , he turns into the other one . I got to say , it 's a pretty cool plan .

 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... I swore an oath . We all did . To protect the world against the much weirder world . It 's got to be some sort of activation signal to HYDRA members within S.H.I.E.L.D. COULSON : We 've had a wolf in the herd the whole time . WARD : They 've infiltrated the highest levels of our organization . BOTH : Ward ! SIMMONS : Ward , you don 't have to do this ! SKYE : Fitz ? Is he okay ? He 's alive . TALBOT : ( OVER LOUDSPEAKER ) On behalf of the United States Armed Forces , I order you to stand down . We 're not HYDRA , we 're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Well right now , to the rest of the world , that 's the same thing . Fury always said a man can accomplish anything when he realizes he 's a part of something bigger . You want me to start over ? Rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. ? MAY : What is this place ? BILLY : I call it the Playground . It is an honor to meet you , sir . I know we don 't have much , but what we have is yours , Director Coulson . ( MAN SHOUTING IN GERMAN ) ( MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS ) Ripped By mstoll ( SPEAKS GERMAN ) I don 't think I need to remind you that the clock is ticking . We are almost finished loading . - Herr Reinhardt , I fear Schmidt ... - Oh . No reason left to fear the Red Skull . He 's dead . However , his vision is not . The work HYDRA has done will live on . The Obelisk ? - They 're bringing it out now . - Carefully , I hope . HYDRA OFFICER : I don 't understand . I thought the stockpile held only artifacts . Not everything we dug out of the ground was an antique , my friend . Some of it was quite advanced . - Is this the reason these men ... - Hmm ? Ja . The Red Skull said it may hold the answer . The answer to death itself . - ( EXPLODING ) - ( GROANS ) I 'll give ' em an " A " for effort . Guten Tag , boys ! All right , nice and calm . No sudden moves or we 'll tie a blasting cap to your ... Hey , Dugan , what 's the German word for " nuts " ? - I don 't know , Jim . - ( COCKS GUN ) But tie a blasting cap to ' em , I bet we 'll hear it . Put it down . Down . These assets are now under protection of the Strategic Scientific Reserve . They 'll be relocated and hidden out of sight indefinitely . As will you . Cut off one head , two more shall grow in its place . Then I guess we 'll keep cutting them off . Get him out of here . All right , boys , let 's pack it up . Agent Carter , what the hell is all this stuff ? - ( SLAMS LID ) - Dangerous . Right now , we need to contain everything and get it out of enemy territory . Mr. Stark plans to go through it tonight . And that we must never touch . This is the last HYDRA site we know of . - They 're finally beaten . - DUGAN : You don 't sound thrilled . Well , these things can 't simply be boxed up . Someone needs to establish a permanent unit during peace time . To keep dangerous technology contained . And watch over people like Stark , who are toying with it . Until then , all we can do is box it up , lock it up and dedicate ourselves to making sure it never sees the light of day . We 've got ears on them . The package is in the open . Don 't engage until the deal 's done . - ( GUN COCKS ) - Copy that . - Trip , we got eyes ? - Now we do . BROWNING : That 's what I 'm selling . I 'm sure you 'd like to see some credentials . Agent Browning , for ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. , you seem awfully indifferent to who we are . What you are is the highest bidder . Whether you 're in it for profit or for HYDRA , it doesn 't concern me . Not anymore . That 's what we wanna hear . What are they buying from him ? Intel . Not hardware . The mystery I 'd like to solve is , why should we be paying you so much ? This looks like a box . Sorry , a picture of a box . A picture of a box you don 't have . The government has it . Along with thousands of other assets they seized from S.H.I.E.L.D. And they don 't know what to make of half of them . I worked in a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility that had hundreds of boxes that looked just like this . But this is the only one that has a Level 10 classified file dedicated to it . You 're selling us a needle in a haystack . Finding the haystack is up to you . I know your reputation . I 'm sure you 'll be fine . What I don 't appreciate is you changing the terms on me now . HARTLEY : We 're asking for clarification , Browning . You 're the one who changed the terms , bringing more than the two guards we agreed upon . I only brought two guards . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( BONES CRACK ) - ( GUNSHOTS ) - ( GROANS ) What the hell are you doing here ? Who was that ? A third party . - A party 's what you call that ? - TRIPLETT : He 's gone . 25-foot drop . This was supposed to be an undercover operation . You wanna explain why you 're shadowing us ? We were your backup . Which you needed . Yeah , so did he . - ( SIREN WAILING ) - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Sir , mark 's down . Third party , possibly HYDRA , and we 're out in the open . What are our orders ? Go dark . They 're fugitives . They deserve to be punished . We witnessed the single greatest intelligence collapse in recorded history , George . We have a duty to the American people to hunt down those responsible . So , no , I don 't sleep most nights . General Talbot , you said you have S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel and weaponry locked in a secure facility . So is it fair to say that S.H.I.E.L.D. and the HYDRA terrorists who poisoned its ranks have been defeated ? The corrupt institution has been dismantled , yes . - ( TIRES SQUEAL ) - We cut down the tree , we pulled up the roots . But let 's just say I 'll rest easier when we throw it all on the bonfire . GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : You didn 't get them all ? HUNTER : Our black-market contacts were the reason the guy believed we weren 't with S.H.I.E.L.D. SKYE : Coulson knows Hartley . She 's the only person on your team he trusts . But Why 'd you break Silhouette Protocol ? - MAY : He ordered us to . - Orders . We can 't maintain solid cover with agents tailing us . And we can 't be sure you won 't run off with the money . Any idea how that freak show found us , Hartley ? - I have a theory . - Cool it . The man said we were the highest bidder . Means he sent the word out wide . And he paid for that mistake . - Yes , he did . - That 's an understatement . AUTOMATED VOICE : Agent May , Agent Skye , Lance Hunter , Agent Hartley ... Operation didn 't go well , I take it ? What gave you that idea ? That 's a shame , man . I was hoping that agent you were scoping out would have some tech we could use . Sorry , Mack . No new toys . You get anything ? A new enemy . I know . I know . Director wants you for debrief . The feeling is mutual . Throw him up on the big screen . We 'll tell him that his enemies have gone bulletproof . He 's in his office . - IDAHO : ( WHISTLES ) Wow . - Coulson 's here ? Kind of buried the lead there , Bill . Just Agent May . Copy that . Really ? Well , tell him I 'd like to voice my opinion , too . On being kept in the dark . 'Cause I don 't like being left out . Get used to it . ( EXHALES ) So , the guy was bulletproof , huh ? That 's sweet . What , like , protective clothing or ... Maybe . We found these metal shards . They broke off with the bullet hits . ( METAL RATTLES ) I 'm gonna take it to the lab . I 'll let Coulson know . It 'll be good to see him . If I see him . He 's a busy man . COULSON : Sorry , that 's all I can give you . Try to move up with your head down . And , hey , only use the dead drop from now on . There aren 't enough pay phones left in this country . Hi . You 're the man in charge , but I 'm in charge of you , remember ? I had two rules . Avoid field operations ... And check in with me every few days . It 's been two weeks . And I 'm flying back out tonight . I have to focus on recruitment . It 's starting to wear me down . - The hours ? - The numbers . Between the traitors , military detainees , and the sellouts in the private sector , the people who could possibly be considered loyal to S.H.I.E.L.D. is not impressive . And they 're scattered all over the damn globe . Well , you have no choice but to meet them face to face . - Get a read on them . - I know . And I prefer it . But flying economy blows . ( COULSON SIGHS ) Any progress on the cloaking equipment ? Like I can tell . Well , we need it now . Badly . Our plane 's been gathering dust for months , but I still can 't risk a takeoff with this guy trying to throw us on a bonfire , so flying coach it is . Though I did score an exit row on the way back from London . - And what was in London ? - Allies . Ready to be activated if necessary . It 's a decent start , but it 's gonna be slow-going without more resources . Bad news on that front . We were hoping Agent Browning would be a friend , and if not at least sell us tech . Negative on both . - The assassin . HYDRA ? - Likely . Possibly Gifted . Killed Browning . He wanted the intel . Another 084 , I guess . What 's your assessment of Hartley 's people ? You know what I think . They 're mercenaries , here for the money . But what 's your assessment ? They 're good mercenaries . Well , Hartley spent a lot of years undercover . Those are the kind of friends you make . If she trusts them ... - What ? - " SSR . " I just read about this . - It 's not in any of the history books . - No . It 's in Fury 's Toolbox . Koenig , cancel my flights . What did it say about this ? An 084 could be anything . That much we 've learned . It 's not just an 084 . It 's the first . And all Fury knew about was the trail of bodies that follows it . Talbot 's saying he 's beaten both sides , but we 're just hiding underground . If HYDRA gets their hands on this , they may not have to . ( BEEPING ) - Hail HYDRA . - Yeah . - Is the package secure ? - Uploading now . He expected a positive result , and sent a gift along as a reward . For this assignment and the next . ( BEEPING ) - A diamond ? - Musgravite . From the caves of Madagascar . One of the rarest gemstones in the world . He believes you 'll find its structure quite pleasurable . Was he right ? ( SIGHS ) He 's always right . Whatever . It 's better than that crap you cooked up in Budapest . I didn 't have much to work with . It was farm-to-table . - It broke my tooth . - That 's ' cause you 're English . Hartley , Hunter , Idaho . - What 's the word ? - In his office . - Director requests an audience . - No , the man doesn 't do requests . And listen , when we get in there , no matter what you do , don 't look him in the eye . Really ? Nah , he 's all right . HARTLEY : But you should both focus on not saying anything overly stupid . IDAHO : Yes , ma 'am . HUNTER : I 'm not making any promises . ( SIGHS ) You took the material to the lab ' ? That 's the top priority now . Yeah . But I don 't know what it 'll get us . How 's the mood in there today ? It 's as good as can be expected . Fitz . Now would be the time I 'd have you test the resonant frequencies of the metal . So that I could determine what properties we 're dealing with . Fitz ? Fitz , can you even hear me ? ( SIGHING ) Yes , Simmons , I can hear you . I 'm trying to hear the bloody resonant frequency you keep going on about , but all I can hear is you ! Calm down . I 'm only asking . You haven 't been able to isolate ... No , I haven 't been able to isolate the ... ( STAMMERS ) ( SNAPS FINGERS ) - Rate of oscillation ? - Yes . I was just about to say that , actually . And no , I haven 't , because it keeps ... Um ... ( SIGHING ) What 's the word again ? Give me the word . - Fluctuating . - Yes . Good . Fine . Thanks , go away . ( PEN CLICKS ) - Have you taken your medication ? - Yes . Hmm . Don 't . Don 't . Please don 't touch anything . That 's the cloaking technology for the plane ! How 's it coming ? Good . Slower than I 'd like . I 've hit a few bumps , but it 's ... I 'm close . - And I don 't need you mucking it up . - Fitz , I 'm trying to help . I know . I know . But I also know how important cloaking is , okay ? So I just need everybody to be ... Everybody to ... I just need everybody to be ... - Patient . - Um ... Yes ! ( THUDS ) You need to be patient with yourself , Fitz . You 're almost there . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm almost there . Any update on the metal we found ? Yeah . Yep . Yep , um , no . Actually , no . I 'm just having a bit of trouble identifying the ... I 'm having a bit of trouble identifying the material . - Okay . - FITZ : Yeah . So this is the same lead that we use in our bullets , but there 's ... There 's something bleeding ... Uh ... Uh , okay , that 's ... Are you ... Can you see that ? - Looks like flesh . - Yeah , I see it . It 's blood . ( SIGHING HEAVILY ) Good . I mean , that 's ... What ? That 's weird . Can you figure out whose blood ? - That shouldn 't be too hard . - That shouldn 't be too hard . I 'll stay and help anyway . COULSON : So the man had powers ? We emptied our mags at the guy . Might as well have been blowing kisses . - Never seen anything like it . - HUNTER : Oh , I have . And usually these encounters come with better financial compensation . - Hunter . - What ? Don 't be yourself right now . You like me like this . Look , you both have your S.H.I.E.L.D. traditions and all that nonsense . And personal reasons for being dedicated to the cause , but you 've known me a long time , Izzy . And what gets me out of bed in the morning . He 's not a big-picture kind of guy . You sound like my ex-wife . - You should 've listened to her , too . - ( SCOFFS ) DNA match . COULSON : Carl Creel . He was on the Index . More importantly , crossed off the Index . S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . Sometimes hostile Gifted individuals are put down . Well , they didn 't do a great job here . They didn 't try . Check who 's the supervising agent . Agent John Garrett . They must have faked creeps termination , recruited him . Well , now we know he 's HYDRA . John Garrett . Isn 't that your mate who , you know , went to the dark side ? Oh , yeah . And then he went nuts . TRIPLETT : It 's a little bit strange . - I mean , they 're exactly the same . - ( SIGHS ) You really think they were just twins ? Come on . I have heard all your theories , Trip . And Koenig 's always mentioning other brothers . Every day , another brother . If he brings up one more brother , I don 't know what I 'm gonna do . Coulson said we can trust him . There 's something fishy going on there , man . You 'll go crazy staring at this crap . What is it again ? Not sure . Something Garrett was messing with . Coulson put me on it a month ago . Searching Deep Web contacts , even Rising Tide , looking for a match . I 've got nothing . There he is . ( CHUCKLES ) Happy to see you , sir . Agent Triplett . Skye . Sir . - Can you give us a moment ? - Watch this . What , no hugs ? He was really looking forward to it . I 've crosschecked the writing from the lab with the new images you 've given me . Mostly the same . But the code breakers haven 't found anything ... That 's not why I 'm here . The bulletproof assassin you encountered on the sting ? We know who he is . You want me to go down there , don 't you ? You 're the only one who can . Is this really what it takes for you and I to get a one-on-one these days ? Why now ? Because the technology in play warrants it . And do I have a say in this ? ( SIGHS ) Copy that . There 's an inertial confinement laser barrier down there , which is cool . Now , this button turns it soundproof , this button makes it opaque . Just tell me there isn 't an off button I can accidentally hit . You 'll be safe . I promise . ( DOOR BEEPS ) ( ENERGY HUMS ) Aren 't you a sight for sore eyes . I told Coulson weeks ago that I was willing to speak to you . To give you intelligence . Why now ? Something bad happen ? Carl Creel . Garrett reported him dead , turns out he 's alive . Do you have any information on that ? How have you been ? The name sounds familiar . Do you have a picture ? ( TABLET BEEPS ) ( ENERGY CRACKLING ) Coulson didn 't tell you ? I went through a rough stretch . The first pair of pants they gave me had a button on the back . They took that away , but you fold a piece of paper just right , it gets sharp . And when they took that away , I started running at the walls . - You should 've run faster . - I 'm through all that . When I came out of sedation , I was clear-headed . Accepting . Of who I am , what I 've done , and why . MAY : You sure about this ? Giving Ward exactly what he wants ? Of course he said he 'd only talk to Skye . He wants to fill her head with lies . He hasn 't lied yet . Now , your arms tell a different story . I see May 's training you . She 's got you favoring your left side first ' cause you 're right-handed . - That 's smart . - SKYE : I 'm gonna say this once . I 'm not gonna believe a word that comes out of your mouth , but if a single word is about anything other than the question that I 'm asking , I walk . Okay . Creel was a boxer . Nicknamed " The Crusher . " Turns out any opponent has a glass jaw when you have steel fists under your gloves . Garrett thought he 'd be an asset . Now , once Creel touches a substance , he can absorb it , and somehow consciously transform the molecules of his body into that substance . He wouldn 't tell us how . But he enjoys the way it feels . Almost as much as he enjoys killing . You two must 've gotten along great . Well , this was fun but pointless . We 've already figured that stuff out . So if you don 't know where to find him ... Wait . When HYDRA was communicating with S.H.I.E.L.D. , we 'd use white noise in the gaps between S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s quantum key distribution channels to hide messages . And S.H.I.E.L.D. might be gone , but not those frequencies . If HYDRA is giving commands to Creel , that 'll be how . SKYE : We 'll see . WARD : It 's true . And so will be every word I say to you for the rest of my life . I 'm not asking for forgiveness . I just wanna help you . And when that information proves true , I hope you 'll come back . There is so much I wanna tell you about ... ( TABLET BEEPS ) ( SIGHS ) ... your father . ( BEEPING ) ( BEEPS ) Believe it or not , there 's a directive going out over those channels right now . Now , I can ping an echo request , see if there 's other receivers out there , how many HYDRA agents can communicate this way . So he 's telling the truth . It looks like it . Thank you . I guess that visit was the first of many , huh ? We kept Ward here for this reason and it 's paying off . ( SIGHS ) What is his deal ? I really don 't know . But it doesn 't matter . As long as he 's giving us an inside look at HYDRA 'S operations . BILLY : Yeah , guys , about that ... ( MONITOR BEEPING ) MAY : You called it . Talbot hasn 't crushed HYDRA . Just sent them slithering back to the shadows . I hate being right . - The Navy ? - ( CHUCKLES ) You said that ? You must be kidding me . Said he likes boats . He likes messing with his old man . That 's what it is . Don 't go far . Excuse me . - The Navy . - Yep . I 'll tell you what , I 'll have something to say about that . Sweetheart , he 's 11 . I 'm sure you 'll wear him down soon enough . - ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - ( CHUCKLES ) - Glenn . - Yeah . - Your phone 's ringing . - That 's not my ... ( CONTINUES RINGING ) Take George , get to the car . Now . - What ? - Now ! Okay . All right . Who is this ? COULSON : General Talbot , you 're in danger . We 're here to ensure your safety . Please listen carefully . Agent Coulson , is this you ? Show yourself so we can talk about it . There 's no time . We 're here to protect you . Listen to me . No , you listen to me . I have my own protection . And a cell for you at Gitmo . - ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) - This is Talbot . I need reinforcements at my location . Now ! MAY : Watch your six ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( CROWD SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANING ) Secure that bastard ! - Move , move , move ! - Yes , sir . HARTLEY : General , let 's get you to cover , sir . SOLDIER : Right there . Go , go . SOLDIER 2 : General , we should get you somewhere safe . General ? Hi again . ( SIGHS ) Son of a bitch . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) Are these straps really necessary ? COULSON : You tell me . I guess , to ensure your safety . I 'm hoping we can work together . Be buddies , like we used to be . " Buddies " ? Last time we saw each other , you assaulted me and my team . So I could go stop a killer . Which I did . Whereas you discovered that secret base , got a big promotion , Brigadier General Talbot . Sounds like a pair of best buds to me . I gotta say . I respect you . You managed to evade us for an entire winter . And I respect you for making it so damn hard . I 'm exhausted . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'll bet . But I wanna make your job easier . Chasing us is a waste of resources , General . We 're the good guys , and we can help you catch the bad guys . Kidnapping me and tying me up in your honeycomb kill room is not helping your case . - Do you think I 'm an idiot ? - Oh , no . You 're the real deal . But you 're surrounded by people who constantly underestimate the threat they 're up against . Me and my people swore an oath we don 't intend to break . To protect the innocent . To watch out for people . People like your son . How dare you bring my family into this ? We save lives . Including yours . Whether you like it or not . That was smooth . Riled him up , got him to grab the arm rest . And now , active fingerprint analysis , 89 % . COULSON : We were there for your protection . Everyone 's safe , no one got hurt . Look at Koenig , running analysis . Looks like we 've got a new golden boy . New ? As opposed to the original ? Yes . Me . And I 've been sidelined . No . Well , I mean , maybe , but in the way that a player is sidelined due to injury in a football match . Football or American football ? 'Cause a head trauma joke right now , Simmons , that 's in severely poor taste . Even for you . ( SIGHS ) And I see the way they look at me . Especially when they keep on asking about the ... ( SNAPS FINGERS ) - Cloaking . - Yeah . No , they 're just anxious about it . They know you 're nearly done . Yeah , well , I may not seem like the genius I used to be , but I still have ideas . - Yeah . - I 'm just having a hard time ... - I 'm just having ... ( SNAPS FINGERS ) - Expressing them . Yeah . And that doesn 't mean that they have to treat me like ... Like what , Fitz ? Treat me like I 'm gonna break . It 's distracting . And , you know , talking to you is the only time I feel clear and calm . Like I might actually get better . You are getting better . Every day . I see it . They see it . And soon you 'll see it yourself . Yeah . You know , they really should be analyzing speech patterns and tracking voice ... - SIMMONS : Voice biometrics . - Biometrics . Yes , Fitz , I think they are . Coulson , I don 't think we see eye-to-eye on this . My team was up to the task when they took that freak into custody . Before you took me . They have him on lockdown . - That 's the problem . - How 's that a problem ? You 've said in your numerous public appearances that you have a facility where you 're storing the technology and prisoners captured in the S.H.I.E.L.D. raids , yes ? Yeah . I 'm flattered you keep up with my press . What 's your point ? Creel 's after a deadly weapon stored in that facility . Here 's some more press . He targeted your family to force you to give up the location of that facility . But now he doesn 't have to . Your people just took a man they have no idea how to contain to the one place he wants to be . Now I need your help to stop him . I 'll make you a deal . You let me out of here and I promise not to kill you . But there is no way on God 's green earth I am ever gonna help you . ( SIGHS ) Well , you might . ( GASPS ) Son of a bitch ! ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) This is Brigadier General Glenn Talbot . Access code Delta-3-6-5-Sierra-Victor-Niner . I want double detail on that prisoner . I want the walls crawling with semi-autos and a vehicle at my location now ! Absolutely , sir . We 'll get right on that . ( SOFTLY ) Victor-Niner . Niner . Okay . All right . You just hold tight , General . ( BEEPS ) Okay , we , uh , traced the number to a spot near the Pentagon . We are ready to go . We have a small logic question . Why ? Why are we going in ? - Look , we trust Coulson 's judgment . - We do ? But Talbot 's not a bad guy . And last I checked , the U.S. government is one of the lesser evils . So they 've got the weapon - in a locked box . - ( GUN COCKS ) And now they 've got this absorbing man in a locked box , too . It 's not so bad . MACK : She 's got a point . It does seem as safe a place to keep them as any . They have no idea what they 're dealing with . Yeah , but is that danger worse than the risk of sending every field operative you have available into a secure military compound ? They 're guarded by the same people that 's been hunting us . - Belly of the beast , man . - ( COCKS GUN ) HUNTER : We 're already on our heels , we can 't even get this thing out of the hangar . COULSON : Exactly . This is a make-or-break moment . For an object we have zero data on ? That 's not the only thing we 're after . It 's all or nothing , huh ? Well , all right , then . You taking point ? Coulson will be on comms , okay ? Let 's stick together on this one . SKYE : You got it . General . Come on , girl . You know I look good . ( BOTH CHUCKLE ) No , they 're saying General Talbot up and vanished . Don 't know how . Think this guy might 've pulled some kind of magic trick . What the ... ( BEEPING ) SOLDIER : He 's gone . Call upstairs . ( INDISTINCT TALKING OVER PA ) I have General Jones and his party here to meet with General Talbot . General Jones ? Sir . I 'm sorry , sir . I don 't have this visit in the register today . You might wanna double-check that . Military installations bury all their cables . Wisely . Not that wisely . Okay . " Delta-3-6-5-Sierra-Victor ... " Niner . If it 's not in here , there 's nothing I can do . Exit to the left , please . - ( KNOCKING ON WINDOW ) - ( TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) Gatehouse . COULSON : ( MIMICKING TALBOT ) This is General Talbot . Why has General Jones and his government escort been delayed at the gate , soldier ? Wave them through . Uh , sir , sorry , sir , his name 's not in the register and my orders are to strictly ... - Now , you listen to me , son . - ( SOFTLY ) Private Tilden . - It 's Private Tilden , isn 't it ? - Yes , sir . Well , I don 't care about this register or that . I want General Jones and his friends sent directly to the ordnance depot to meet me . ( WHISPERING ) Hey , hey . Go bigger , go bigger . Or I 'll have you so deep in horse manure , son , you 'll need a damn snorkel . - I understand , sir . But I can 't ... - ( BEEPING ) Oh . Never mind ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) ... sir . Nice work , soldier . Next time you see me , come shake my hand . Talbot out . ( MOUTHING ) What ? ( BEEPING ) Stay and keep it running in case we have to abort . Got it . HARTLEY : Needle in a haystack . Turns out I was not exaggerating . All right , we know what we 're looking for . Don 't we ? I 've got the 084 . Repeat , I 've got the damn thing . Southwest side . ( GASPS ) - ( CLANGING ) - ( GRUNTING ) Okay . Why don 't we find out what makes this thing so deadly ? ( SHOUTS ) No ! ( GASPING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) What the hell is happening ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) I can 't let go ! - ( ALARM BLARING ) - ( HARTLEY GROANING ) MAY : Okay , Hartley , just relax your hand . HARTLEY : I can 't let go ! ( SCREAMING ) Don 't touch it . Just stay away . They 'll be on us any second . Okay , time to go . Help me get her up . - Can you walk ? - HARTLEY : I think so . What are you waiting for ? We need to get her out of here before we all get killed . We got what we came for . - Not everything we came for . - Wait , what are you talking about ? Coulson . Hartley has the item , but it 's attacking her . She needs medical , right now . Do we abort ? BILLY : Alarms have sounded . Chances of them being captured or killed here just skyrocketed . MAY : Should we just cut our losses ? Coulson ! Come on . Come on ! Sir , I repeat , what are our orders ? Do we go dark ? Negative . Do not abort . Proceed as planned . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - You heard him . - Help me up . I can follow . - Are you mental ? - We have our orders . Screw the orders . We need to get you to a doctor . - SKYE : Hunter ... - No , no , stay here and die , if that 's what you wanna do , but I 'm making sure she doesn 't . I wish you the best of luck , really , but we 're out of here . MAN 1 : Over here ! MAN 2 : This way . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) MAN : Let 's go ! They 're headed to the west door ! ( HARTLEY GRUNTING ) Get us the hell out of here ! - ( HARTLEY SCREAMING ) - You got it . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Cut it off . What ? No ! We 'll get you to a hospital ! They 'll fix this . This thing is killing me . I can feel it . I need you to cut it off or I won 't make it to the hospital . It 's no big deal . You 've seen what they can do with robotics these days . Probably be an upgrade . I don 't wanna die . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) Okay . COULSON : I know it was a risk . If we went down today , we 'd probably be down for good . But now we have a chance to survive . We have soldiers willing to sacrifice . But they need weapons . The enemy has the advantage . We need one of our own . - You risked that for a Quinjet ? - COULSON : No . For what we can do with one . Disappear . Become ghosts . That 's how we have to live now . In the shadows . To save people even when they don 't know it , don 't want it . Fitz said he could engineer cloaking , but I 'm afraid he can 't do anything . The damage to his temporal lobe was too extensive . He 's not the same , and since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse . This is number two of five . If I don 't get this one finished ... Simmons , I said not to touch anything . Yes . Yes , I know . I know . And I have told them to be patient , like you said , but I 'm still having trouble communicating the ... Yes ! Thank you . Sorry . COULSON : Simmons said she thought he 'd be better without her here . But her leaving just broke him . In the months since , he 's grown isolated . Talking to himself more and more . I know .

And then , we 'll disappear . - ( GASPS ) - ( TIRES SCREECH ) ( GROANING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) BAKSHI : Creel has escaped . And did indeed make off with the Obelisk . He should contact us shortly . I would have him come in , but I 'm being overly discreet with this operation . I know how long you have been searching for this , Dr. Whitehall . You have no idea . Ripped By mstoll

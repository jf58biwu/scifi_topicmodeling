BISHOP ANYTHING HE WANTS . OH , IT WOULD BE AN HONOR . ( Walter ) WHO IS THAT ? IT WAS A CASE THAT WE WORKED . HE STARTED TO EXHIBIT EMPATHIC ALIES . WHY WOULD I NEED AN EMPATH ? WE USED THIS PLACE TO HIDE HIM UNTIL SOMEONE COULD RETURN FOR HIM . THERE IT IS . ( Walter ) HE 'S NOT HERE . I THINK WHOEVER TOOK THE BOY LEFT THIS BEHIND . ( Astrid ) IT 'S PICKING UP A SIGNAL . THIS IS WHERE THE SIGNAL ORIGINATES . ( Richard ) WHAT DO YOU WANT ? HE DEFINITELY DOESN 'T HAVE THE TECH . ( Astrid ) MAYBE IT WAS REMOVED . NO , THERE 'S NO SCAR TISSUE . [ laughing ] HERE , TRY THIS . [ laughing ] O IT 'S GOOD . MICHAEL , YOU USED TO WRITE THINGS DOWN FOR ME . YOU HELPED US CATCH A BAD MAN . DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ? MICHAEL , YOU 'RE VERY SPECIAL , AND THERE 'S A LOT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO LEARN ABOUT YOU . MY FATHER WAS WORKING ON A PLAN WITH A MAN NAMED DONALD . YOU WERE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PLAN . DO YOU REMEMBER THAT ? YOU DO , AND YOU KNOW ME . WE SHOULD JUST GO INTO HIS MIND , LIKE WE DID WITH SEPTEMBER . SEPTEMBER WAS IN A COMA . SO WE PUT HIM IN ONE TOO . WE 'RE NOT PUTTING HIM IN A COMA . THEN , WE PUT AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PROBE INTO THE BASE OF HIS SKULL , AND PLY HIM FULL OF SEROTONIN , NEURONTIN , AND LSD . ( Astrid ) WALTER , HE IS JUST A CHILD . HE IS NOT JUST A CHILD ! HE 'S MORE THAN A CHILD . HE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MY PLAN . HE MUST KNOW THAT ! HE 'S JUST NOT SAYING ANYTHING FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER . YOU SAID YOURSELF , HE WROTE THINGS BEFORE . WHY IS HE NOT DOING THAT NOW ? WHO IS DONALD ? WHERE IS HE ? IS HE ALIVE ? I MUST FIND HIM . TELL ME . WHO IS HEY ! LD ? WHERE IWALTER , CALM DOWN . HOW CAN I CALM DOWN , PETER ? WE 'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME . DON 'T YOU UNDERSTAND ? WE GOT A WORLD TO SAVE ! ACID , GET BACK TO CUTTING OUT THOSE TAPES . WE 'RE NOT GONNA GET ANY ANSWERS OUT OF HIM . PETER , IT DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . I MEWE USED TO HAVE HE 'S AN EMA CONNECTION . HE USED TO FEEL WHAT I WANTED AND THEN HE 'D COMMUNICATE IT TO ME . NO IJUST SEEMS LIKE HE CAN 'T . [ phone rings ] NINA , IT 'S OLIVIA . IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ? NINA , WE NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING . WHAT ? [ no audio ] IT 'S NOT SAFE FOR ME TO TALK HERE . LET ME CALL YOU IN TEN MINUTES . CAN I HELP YOU ? YOU ARE A LOYALIST . THEN YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS . WHERE IS YOUR SUPERIOR ? I 'M NOT SURE . SHE GOT A CALL A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND THEN TOLD ME SHE WAS TAKING AN EARLY LUNCH . WHO WAS THE CALL FROM ? IT CAME IN ON HER PRIVATE COMM . WHEN DID THIS OCCUR ? ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO . BRING AN LQ7 UNIT . WE DON 'T HAVE MUCH TIME . WHEN IS SHE EXPECTED TO RETURN ? SHE 'S ALWAYS BACK BY 1 : 00 . FUGITIVES WE ARE SEEKING RECENTLY USED A SUBLATN DEVICE TO ACCESS AN ABANDONED STORAGE FACILITY . WE HAVE TRACED THE DEVICE TO THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE . SOMEONE HERE HAS SUPPLIED THEM WITH IT , I SUSPECT FROM THIS OFFICE . [ fearful breathing ] IT IS NOT YOU I AM CONCERNED WITH . [ exhales ] [ machine beeps ] [ machine chirping ] [ garbled speech ] [ slow , distorted ] THIS IS NINA SHARP . IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ? [ distorted ] WE 'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE . [ garbled speech ] [ heavily distorted ] WHAT ? A CHILD ? [ machine beeps ] A CHILD OBSERVER ? [ distorted ] WE 'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE . IT 'S NOT SAFE FOR ME TO TALK HERE . LET ME CALL YOU IN TEN MINUTES . [ mysterious music ] ♪ ♪ NINA , THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DOING THIS . I KNOW THE RISK YOU 'RE TAKING . NONSENSE . I 'M NOTHING IF I CAN 'T BE A RESOURCE FOR YOU . NOW , WHERE IS HE ? HELLO . MY NAME IS NINA . WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE ? I 'M COLD . I HAVE ACCESS TO TECH THAT I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL FOR YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM . IT 'S IN A LAB NOT FAR FROM HERE . A MINISTRY LAB ? YOU THINK THAT 'S SAFE ? NOT A MINISTRY LAB . A BLACK LAB . I THOUGHT MASSIVE DYNAMIC BLACK LABS DIDN 'T EXIST . WELL , I 'M GLAD I CAN STILL SURPRISE YOU . SINCE THE INVASION , I 'VE ALLOWED IT TO BE USED BY THE RESISTANCE . [ siren wailing ] WE SHOULD GET GOING . HOW 'S WALTER DOING ? WHICH ONE ? AH . HE 'S VACILLATING LATELY . AND HE DROPPED ACID YESTERDAY , SO THAT DIDN 'T EXACTLY HELP . [ laughs ] WELL , HE HASN 'T CHANGED THAT MUCH . HE CATCHES ME OFF GUARD . I LOOK HIM IN THE EYES SOMETIMES , AND I SEE A STARE THAT I DON 'T RECOGNIZE . HE TD ME THAT YOU AGREED TO REMOVE THE PIECES OF HIS BRAIN ONCE HE COMPLETED THE PLAN TO DEFEAT THE OBSERVERS . NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF INCENTIVE . YOU DON 'T APPROVE ? WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM ? AFTER THE TISSUE HAS BEEN REMOVED , WHAT HAPPENS TO WALTER ? HOW MANY TIMES CAN A HUMAN BRAIN ENDURE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ? WALTER TOLME THAT THAT W A RK THAT HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE . I DON 'T ACCEPT THAT . YOU MAY NOT HAVE TO . IF THE PLAN ISN 'T COMPLETED IN TIME , HE MAY REGRESS COMPLETELY AND NO LONGER WANT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT . SO WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING IS I LOSE HIM EITHER WAY ? WHAT YOU 'RE SAYING IS THAT YOUR FATHER UNDERSTANDS THAT ANYTHING WORTH FIGHTING FOR COMES WITH A COST . PERHAPS SHE HAS BEEN ALERTED TO OUR PRESENCE HERE . IT WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME . EVERY CONSRACY HAS A NETWK . I WANT TO SEE THFACILITY FROM WHICH THE SUBLIMATION DEVICE WAS TAKEN . [ keypad beeping ] IT 'S OKAY . ( Nina ) IT 'S BETTER IF HE STAYS BACK THERE FOR A MOMENT . THE RESISTANCE EXPERIMENTED ON OBSERVERS HERE ? YES . AMONG OTHER THINGS , WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WERE READING US . PERHAPS CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD GIVE US THE SAME ADVANTAGE . DID IT WORK ? NO . WE WERE ONLY ABLE TO EXTRACT BITS AND PIECES OF DATA . IMAGES , WORDS IN THEIR CONSCIOUS MINDS , BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BE USEFUL . HOWEVER , IF YOU WERE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE OBSERVER CHILD USING NEURAL STIMULATION ONCE BEFORE , THIS TECHNOLOGY MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU DO IT AGAIN . YOU ALL RIGHT ? YOU 'RE THINKING ABOUT HER ? YEAH , EVERY TIME I SEE ONE OF THOSE POSTERS , MY HEART JUMPS . YEAH , MINE TOO . IT 'S HARD TO SEE HER FACE , BUT AT THE SAME TIME , I WANT TO . YOU READY IN THERE ? YEAH , YEAH . IT 'S ALL GOOD . LIKE OURS , OBSERVER BRAINS TRANSLATE EXTERNAL STIMULI- - LANGUAGE , SIGHTS , SOUNDS- - INTO PATTERNS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY , WHICH WE COMMONLY CALL " THOUGHTS . " COME ON , MICHAEL . THIS IS AN ELECTRO-COGNITIVE TRANSLATOR . AN " ECOG " FOR SHORT . HOW DOES IT WORK ? BY INTERPRETING PATTERNS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY INTO WORDS AND IMAGES THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND . ALLOWING YOU TO READ THEIR THOUGHTS . FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES , YES . ( Walter ) THIS WILL SUFFICE . PREP THE SUBJECT . HIS NAME 'S MICHAEL . CAPTAIN WINDMARK , WE 'VE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE NINA SHARP 'S COMM DEVICE . CONTINUE LOOKING . [ overlapping whispering ] MR. RHODE , WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT NINA SHARP IS A TRAITOR . SHE IS WORKING FOR THE RESISTANCE . DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLELEDGE OF THAT ? NO . DO YOU KNOW WHERE SHE IS ? NO . I BELIEVE YOU . ( Peter ) THIS IS GONNA BE A LITTLE COLD . [ device strap clicking ] WE 'RE JUST GONNA DO A TEST , BUT IT WON 'T HURT . I PROMISE . HIS CORTICAL ACTIVITY IS OFF THE CHARTS . THE NEURAL LINK IS GOOD . WE 'RE READY . OKAY . MICHAEL , IF AT ANY POINT , YOU WANT TO STOP , YOU JUST SQUEEZE MY HAND . OKAY ? MICHAEL , DO YOU REMEMBER WHY YOU 'RE SO IMPORTANT TO WALTER 'S PLAN ? HIS MIND IS RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION . HMM . THE ECOG IS ATTEMPTING TO TRANSLATE HIS NEURAL ACTIVITY , BUT HE 'S PROCESSING INFORMATION IN A WAY I 'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE . THIS IS NOT LIKE ANY OF THE OTHER OBSERVERS FROM OUR TRIALS . THE SOFTWARE CAN 'T INTERPRET IT . SOMETHING HAS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED WITH THE SUBJECT . MICHAEL . WHATEVER ALLOWED US TO COMMUNICATE BEFORE IS NO LONGER VIABLE . YOU SAID THE BOY FORMED A BOND WITH OLIVIA , HELPED HER SOLVE A CASE ONCE . THAT 'S RIGHT . SO HE DID SO , BECAUSE HE KNEW WHAT YOU WANTED . HE COULD FEEL IT THROUGH THE EMPATHIC CONNECTION WITH YOU . MAYBE HE CAN 'T HELP US NOW BECAUSE THAT CONNECTION NO LONGER EXISTS . SO YOU 'RE SAYING HE CAN 'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WANT ? SO HOW CAN HE HELP US ? WE 'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET INTO HIS MIND . MAYBE THE ANSWER IS LETTING HIM GET INTO OURS . ( Walter ) YES . THAT IS BRILLIANT , NINA . WE NEED TO CREATE A LINK BETWEEN ONE OF OUR CONSCIOUS NDS AND THE BOY 'S . WELL , HOW DO WE DO THAT ? WELL , IT 'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME , I HAVE TO RECONFIGURE THE ECOG 'S SOFTWARE , AND YOU 'VE GOT TO RETURN TO THE WAREHOUSE AT THE MINISTRY OF SCIENCE TO GET ANOTHER ECOG HALO AND A NEURAL ADAPTOR FOR THE SEND PERSON . IS THAT GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ? NO , I 'VE GOT A MAN IN ARCHIVES . HE 'LL GIVE US WHAT WE WANT . HASTINGS ? YES . NEXT . NAME ? HASTINGS , DARRYL R. [ phone ringing ] [ phone ringing ] [ phone ringing ] ( Nina ) I STILL CAN 'T GET THROUGH TO HASTING . ( Walter ) THIS IS INTOLERABLE . WITHOUT THE NEURAL ADAPTOR AND THE SECOND E.C.O.G. HALO , WE HAVE NO WAY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOY . DON 'T WORRY , WALTER . WE 'LL GET ' EM . NINA WILL HAVE THE PASS CODE . WELL , HER COMM DOESN 'T WORK UNDERGROUND , SO THERE 'S NO WAY TO CONTACT HER . DO YOU THINK THAT WE CAN BYPASS THIS ? [ phone rings ] HEY , GUYS . ASTRID , I NEED YOUR HELP BREAKING THROUGH A SECURITY LOCK . I 'M ON IT . GIVE ME THE MODEL NUMBER . [ door opening ] NEXT . I 'M A QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER . I ASSESS AND MAINTAIN THE TECHNOLOGY WAREHOUSED IN THIS FACILITY . I DON 'T REPORT DIRECTLY TO NINA SHARP , BUT INDIRECTLY , SOMETIMES I DO . MR. HASTINGS , WE BELIEVE- - DOCTOR . IT 'S DR. HASTINGS . DR. HASTINGS . OKAY , YOU 'RE GONNA WANT TO TAKE THE BROWN WIRE FROM THE PAD AND ATTACH IT TO THE COMM 'S RECEIVING NODE . ALL RIGHT , THE COMM 'S ATTACHED . NOW , I 'M GOING TO SEND A CONTINUOUS STREAM OF DATA TO YOUR COMM DEVICE . HOPEFULLY , ILLE ENOUGH TO SHORT OUT THE LOCKING CIRCUITRY . HOPEFULLY ? I THOUGHT SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS DOING . ( Astrid ) OKAY , I 'M SENDING IT NOW . YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEP BACK . OKAY , WE 'RE IN . WE BELIEVE A SUBLIMATION DEVICE FROM THIS FACILITY WAS PROVIDED TO KNOWN FUGITIVES . ARE YOU AWARE OF THIS ? NO . I DO NOT BELIEVE YOU . RESTRAIN HIM . DISMISS THE REST . ( Walter ) WE MAY AS WELL BE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK . NO , IT 'S ALL ARRANGED ACCORDING TO SERIAL NUMBER . LOOK . THERE 'S A TERMINAL . MAYBE WE CAN ACCESS THE DATABASE . ( Walter ) CAN YOU RUN A SEARCH ? YEAH . [ typing ] THERE . 18-C-6 . UP THERE , ON THE TOP SHELF . WINDMARK 'S HERE . WHAT ? HE 'S WITH HASTINGS . [ high-frequency drone ] [ wincing ] IT WAS AN OUTDATED MODEL . I DIDN 'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE USING IT FOR . YOU WANTED TO HELP THEM . YOU ADMIRE THEM . YOU ADMIRE DR. BISHOP . [ whimpering ] YES . I ADMIRE HIM . WHERE IS NINA SHARP NOW ? I SWEAR , I DON 'T KNOW . WHERE ARE THE FUGITIVES ? YOUR LOYALTY WILL BE REWARDED . I DON 'T KNOW . I DON 'T KNOW . MICHAEL , I NEED YOU TO STAY HERE . I 'LL BE RIGHT BACK . THERE . THAT 'S HER SIGNAL . THE COMPONENTS ARE INTACT . WE GOT TO GET OUT [ comm beeping ] ERE , NOW . IT 'S NINA . OLIA , IS EVETHING ALL RIGHT ? NINA , I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME . YOU 'VE BEEN COMPROMISED . WHAT ? E OBSERVERS AND WINDMARK ARE HERE . THEY 'RE INTERROGATING HASTINGS NOW . YOU CAN 'T COME BACK TO THE MINISTRY , AND YOU CAN 'T GO HOME . IT 'S OKAY . I HAVE TO GO NOW . I 'M SORRY . [ smash ] [ clatter ] [ sighs ] OKAY , WE 'RE READY . LET 'S GO . WAIT . THEY 'RE GONE . A GUARD JUST CAME IN AND TOLD WINDMARK SOMEING , AND THEN THEY LEFT . WE 'RE GOING TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF YOU . ( Olivia ) MY THOUGHTS EXACTLY . DR. HASTINGS , CAN YOU HEAR ME ? I TRIED . I TRIED . IT 'S OKAY . HE KNOWS . WHAT ? WHAT DOES WINDMARK KNOW ? NINA , THEY TRACKED HER . THEY KNOW WHERE SHE IS . IT 'S OKAY . EVERYTHING 'S GOING TO BE FINE . I 'M JUST ... [ sighs ] IT DOESN 'T MATTER . THERE 'S NOTHING FOR YOU TO WORRY ABOUT . OH , MY GOD . [ computer beeping ] MICHAEL , COME WITH ME , QUICKLY . WHAT 'S WRONG ? WHY ARE WE STOPPING ? ( Peter ) CHECKPOINT . WE NEED TO TURN AROUND . IF I BACK UP NOW , I TURN AROUND , WE 'RE GONNA DRAW TOO MUCH ATTENTION . WE NEED TO DITCH THE CAR . ONE AT A TIME . WALTER , YOU FIRST . GET OUT NOW . [ overlapping chatter ] OKAY , GO . [ overlapping chatter ] ( man ) IT 'S CLEAR . THEY CAN GO . [ engine turns over ] [ tires screeching ] [ tires screeching ] FIND THEM . CAPTAIN WINDMARK . THE FUGITIVES . WHERE ARE THEY ? YOU 'RE TOO LATE . THEY 'RE LONG GONE . YOU ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THEM . WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE FUGITIVES , I WONDER , THAT INSTILLS SUCH MISGUIDED LOYALTY ? YOU ARE TRYING TO BLOCK YOUR THOUGHTS FROM ME , BUT IT WILL NOT LAST . YOU ... ANIMALS . YOU ARE THINKING OF HIM . THE BOY . THIS MORNING , YOU WERE CONTACTED IN YOUR OFFICE . YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A CHILD OBSERVER . HE IS IMPORTANT TO THE FUGITIVES . WHY IS HE IMPORTANT TO THEM ? WHAT IS HIS PURPOSE ? WHY DOES A CHILD WORRY YOU SO MUCH ? HE IS MERELY A CURIOSITY , AND YOU ARE MISTAKEN ABOUT HIM . HE IS NO CHILD . HE IS A CHROMOSOMAL MISTAKE . A GENETIC ANOMALY . DESIGNATE : PROGENY XB-6783746 . LIKE ALL ANOMALIES , HE WAS SCHEDULED TO BE DESTROYED . BUT HE WENT MISSING . IT WAS A GREAT MYSTERY IN MY TIME . NO ONE KNEW WHAT BECAME OF HIM ... UNTIL NOW . [ high-frequency drone ] [ grimacing ] I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO MEET HIM . [ droning ] TELL ME WHERE HE IS . [ droning ] ( officer ) CAPTAIN WINDMARK ? [ droning stops ] THERE 'S NO SIGN OF ANYONE ELSE HERE . THEN I WILL HAVE TO RESORT TO A DEEPER EXTRACTION . WHY ? " WHY ? " WHY ARE YOU NOT FRIGHTENED ? DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU TILT YOUR HEAD IN THAT WAY ? IT 'S AN INVOLUNTARY REFLEX IN YOUR PHYSIOLOGY . IT CHANGES THE ANGLE AT WHICH SOUND WAVES HIT THE EARDRUM , ALLOWING IN MORE STIMULI . LIKE A LIZARD . I 'VE STUDIED THEM TOO . INTRIGUING CHARACTERS . THEIR BRAINS HAVE EVOLVED OVER 320 MILLION YEARS , YET FOR ALL THEIR EVOLUTION , THEY FORM NO BONDS . LOVE DOES NOT EXIST FOR THEM . THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF DREAMING , OF CONTEMPLATING BEAUTY , OF KNOWING SOMETHING GREATER THAN THEMSELVES , NOT UNLIKE YOUR KIND . THE EXPERIMENTS WE CONDUCTED RIGHT HERE IN THIS LAB , YIELDED A SURPRISING RESULT , BECAUSE FOR ALL YOUR YEARS OF EVOLUTION , YOU INADVERTENTLY REDEVELOPED AND HONED PRIMITIVE INSTINCTS THAT WE MOVED BEYOND LONG AGO . SO IN REALITY , YOU 'RE THE ANIMAL . RESTRAIN HER . YOU CANNOT HURT ME WITH THAT . I KNOW . [ gunshot ] WALTER , MAYBE YOU SHOULD STAY IN THE VAN . I 'M COMING WITH YOU . [ gasps ] [ sobbing ] NINA ? [ sobs ] THEY 'VE GOT THE BOY . WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY 'LL DO TO HIM . WHAT DID HE DO TO HER ? WHERE 'S SHE GOING ? SHE STOPPED WINDMARK FROM READING HER . TO PROTECT US . TO PROTECT THE PLAN . AND TO PROTECT THE BOY . THEY LEFT WITHOUT HIM . HE 'S STILL HERE . MICHAEL ? ( Peter ) MICHAEL ? MICHAEL , YOU CAN COME OUT NOW ! IT 'S SAFE ! ( Olivia ) MICHAEL ! MICHAEL ? MICHAEL . PETER ! YOU ALL RIGHT ? [ grunts ] IT 'S OKAY . MICHAEL ? HE 'S CRYING . [ device strap clicking ] YOU READY ? ( Astrid ) YEAH . [ machine humming ] IF YOU UNDERSTAND ME , TOUCH YOUR NOSE . ( Walter ) [ chuckles ] GOOD . THAT 'S VERY GOOD . DO YOU REMEMBER MEETING ME A LONG TIME AGO , WITH A MAN NAMED DONALD ? HE DOES . HE REMEMBERS . DO YOU KNOW WHY I NEEDED YOU FOR MY PLAN ? CAN YOU TELL ME WHY YOU ARE IMPORTANT ? THE BOY IS IMPORTANT . HE HAS TO LIVE . WHAT HAPPENED ? I KNOW WHO DONALD IS . DONALD IS SEPTEMBER . BAD ROBOT .

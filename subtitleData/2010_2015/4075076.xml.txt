 Previously on Fringe : I crossed into another universe , took a son that wasn 't mine . Not a day has passed without me feeling the burden of that act . Peter deserves to know the truth about who he is . You saved his life . I am sure that he will understand . You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side , you brought me back . - Son , this- - - I am not your son . Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He 's gone . I 'll be the roundabout The words will make you out ' n ' out I 'll spend the day Walter . I 've decided that we need to get organized . You 've been smoking marijuana . I would hardly classify what I 've just smoked as marijuana . It 's a hybrid of Chronic Supernova and Afghani Kush . I call it Brown Betty . Walter ... . I know how you 're feeling . It 's important to take control of one 's life . Walter , Peter is going to come back . He just needs some time . But he will come back . - Oh . - Hey . Hey . Is there news ? Have you found him ? I 'm sorry , Walter . I have some leads I would like to follow up . - But I have to- - - You have to what ? What can be more important than finding Peter ? Aunt Liv , the snack machine stole the dollar you gave me . - Hi , Astrid . Hi , Uncle Walter . - Hi , Ella . You know what ? We have some snacks back there in the fridge . - You can go help yourself . - Thanks . Who 's that ? - Ella , Walter . Rachel 's daughter . - It smells funny in here . Rachel 's Olivia 's sister . Rachel had to go to Chicago for the weekend so she asked if I could look after Ella . And I was wondering if maybe you could watch her- - I couldn 't possibly look after anyone . I 'm well into Phase 1 . I think she 's talking about me . Walter just smoked something called Brown Betty . - Hi , cow . - Be careful , Stella . Gene , no licking . No licking . You should only have to watch her for a few hours . Don 't worry , Olivia . I will be here . We would love to have her . You 're killing him . You 're not supposed to touch the sides . What kind of doctor are you ? You 're not even trying . His heart . All you 've done is eat all my snacks and talk about weird stuff . And everything makes you laugh . I know , why don 't you tell me a story ? - I 'm not very good at stories . - Didn 't you tell stories to Peter ? I 'm sure Mrs. Bishop did but , no , I never told Peter stories . I was always too busy , with my work . What about your parents , Uncle Walter ? Didn 't they tell you stories ? Oh , yes . My mother loved Chandler and another writer called Dashiell Hammett . She loved detective stories . Oh , and musicals . She adored musicals . She often would dress me up to play parts in plays at school . I was roughed up quite a lot as a child . Walter , I think that Ella would really , really enjoy a story . Once upon a time ... . Well , all right . You ready ? Once upon a time there was an accomplished detective . Except that she had decided to retire , pack it in because there was one mystery she could not solve . - What was that ? - How to mend a broken heart . Ms. Dunham ? My name is Rachel . I 'm sorry to just show up like this but I 've left you several messages and I 'd like to hire you . My boyfriend . He 's gone missing . As you can see , I 'm busy . He got in over his head to a gambler , a guy named Big Eddie . I 'm afraid something bad may have happened . - Drown them ? - I 'm sorry , what ? Oh , no , thank you . You know , most times , when someone comes in here worried their sweetheart 's gone missing or worse by the time they find out what I usually find out they wind up wishing he really were dead . What do you usually find out ? Rachel , is it ? Do yourself a favor . Go home . He wouldn 't do what you 're suggesting . We met only a few weeks ago but it was love at first sight . You probably don 't believe something like that exists . But I assure you , it does . Something happens and I 'm head over heels I never find out Till I 'm head over heels Something happens And I 'm head over heels Don 't take my heart Don 't break my heart Don 't , don 't , don 't throw it away What those school kids must have done to you . Maybe you should teach me algebra . Oh , you see , the medication that Uncle Walter is on causes his posterior and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles to contract his larynx . Anyway , what was I saying ? Ah . Yes . True love . When was the last time you spoke to him ? - On the telephone , two days ago . - Okay , and what 's his name ? Peter Bishop . Wait a minute , that 's wrong . My mom doesn 't love Peter . Of course not . It 's just a story . But as with all good stories , things aren 't always as they seem . - So where were we ? - She just took the case . Oh , yes . How could she not ? See , what Rachel didn 't know is that Detective Olivia once believed in love . Especially great love . And if for no other reason she took this case to see if such a love really existed . Now , this is where things might get a bit frightening . - I 'm not sure you 'd want me to go on . - Does it have to do with Peter ? Maybe . It just might . You see , just as Olivia was gathering the facts from Rachel far on the other side of town , a young man had gone into hiding . Because he had in his possession a very special item . What kind of item ? As it happens a heart . But a heart unlike anything the world had ever seen . Now the measure of a good detective is where she gets her information from . Is he here ? Detective Dunham knew some high people in low places . And you just can 't escape from the sound Don 't worry too much It 'll happen to you We were children once Playing with toys Hello , Lieutenant Broyles . Good to see you . What 's the matter , not gonna say hello ? Well , I didn 't know if you actually meant " hello " or if you were just stringing me along . You 're good at that . - I need to ask a favor . - Must be good if you 're coming to me . Not as good as pretending six years ago I didn 't see a cop on the beat plant evidence to get a promotion . But , yeah , it 's important . - What is it ? - Missing person . - Never seen him . - What about this ? Does it mean anything to you ? Guy 's sweetheart found it in her apartment the night he vanished . It 's a company logo . Massive Dynamic . Ever heard of them ? - No . What do they do ? - Question is , what don 't they do ? Indeed . What don 't they do ? Olivia did her homework and soon found out ... - ... some of the things they did do . - Like what ? Massive Dynamic made its money at any cost . A vile firm that never missed an opportunity to exploit the little guy . Profiteering off the creativity of others . Ms. Dunham . Nina Sharp . - Pleasure to meet you . - Thank you so much for seeing me . Detective Broyles called on your behalf . He said you were looking for someone . You thought I may be able to provide some information . Yes . His name is Peter Bishop . I 'm investigating his disappearance on behalf of his fianc√©e . She believes he may be in trouble . That wouldn 't surprise me . Whatever trouble he 's in , I 'm sure he deserves much worse . Peter Bishop is a con man with many talents and many identities , all of them suspect . Small cons to large-scale industrial espionage with only one person 's interests - his own . - I see . - But I can tell you one thing if he 's pretending to love this woman he must be using her somehow . For her sake , and yours , I hope he stays missing . He 's dangerous . I 'm sorry , my attention is required on another matter . Of course . Thank you so much for your time . Ms. Dunham ? You should proceed with caution . I meant it when I said that Peter Bishop is dangerous . It 's me . There has been a development . Hello , this is Rachel . Please leave a message . Hi , this is Olivia Dunham . I need to talk to you . It 's about Peter Bishop . So could you give me a call as soon as you get this ? - Rachel ? - Help me , Ms. Dunham . Rachel . That 's not how it goes . - She can 't be dead . - Why not ? Probably because it 's her mother , Walter . - Oh . - No , that 's not it . Because that 's not how stories work . She 's in love , true love . She can 't die . But , as I have said , in this story , things are not as they seem . She was an actress . Real name wasn 't even Rachel . It was Kelsie . Don 't ask me what to make of it . We 're in the dark . But whoever did this was good . Didn 't leave fingerprints . Hell , we can 't even identify what kind of weapon he used . But one thing we both know , Dunham , death still seems to follow you around . What you saying there , chief ? I 'm saying I want you as far away as possible . Just when my interest is piqued ? Keep nosing around and your interest can spend some time downtown ... - ... as a guest of the state . - That 's three hot meals and a bed . It 's tempting . But I think I 'll pass . I 'm serious , Dunham . Time to leave things to the big boys . Okay . You win . - Directory assistance . - Yes , operator ? - I would like an address , please . - Go ahead , hon , what 's the name ? For ... - ... Dr. Walter Bishop . - It 's you . Kind of . Slightly less handsome than your Uncle Walter , but equally brilliant . A tinkerer . A dreamer . And Olivia would soon discover that he was the one that got her mixed up in all this . So you 're saying you hired her to hire me to find Peter Bishop ? - That 's right . - Why didn 't you come to me yourself ? Your reputation precedes you , Ms. Dunham . You are the best . But you 're selective . You only take cases where someone has lost their heart to love . I used her to get your attention . I never meant for her to be harmed . Well , you 've got my attention now , Dr. Bishop . Who the hell is Peter Bishop ? Why are you looking for him ? - He was my lab assistant . - You got the same name . You related ? Just coincidental although I did grow to love Peter as a son . But , apparently , he was far more dangerous than I feared . He stole something from me . My most important invention . I 've spent my life inventing things that bring joy and happiness to make the world a better place . Bubble gum , that was one of my first . Flannel pajamas . Ah , rainbows . - And my latest project , singing corpses . - Two , three , four . - Who can take a sunrise - Who can take a sunrise - Sprinkle it with dew - Sprinkle it with dew Cover it with chocolate And a miracle or two The candy man The candy man can 'Cause he mixes it with love And makes the world taste good Why not bring a little life to the dead , I say ? The harmonies are still a bit off . - What 's this ? - Well , it 's a hug , of course . - He invented hugs ? - Oh , yes , my dear . He invented everything that is wonderful in the world . Teddy bears and chocolate bars . And something even more remarkable than that . A heart . A glass heart . - What makes it so special ? - Put simply , it 's a power source . But it 's capable of many wondrous things . And until quite recently I was kept alive by this glass heart . I had a bad heart , and so I invented a glass heart . But then , a few nights ago , someone slipped into my room and stole it when I was asleep . I 've done what I can with these batteries . It 's kept me stable , but if I don 't get my heart back , I 'll die . You think Peter Bishop stole your heart ? They disappeared at the same time . The heart is priceless . Who knows what somebody would pay for it ? I have so much good left to do . If I die , I 'll never get to finish any of them . All of my ideas they will all die with me . She 's gonna help him , right ? Of course , but first , she needed to rehire her assistant Esther Figglesworth . I have plenty of experience with all kinds of people . I 'm sure that would come in handy , right ? I mean , mental patients probably need tons of patience . And love too , they probably need love , right ? I really need this job Please , God , I need this job I 've got to get this job I 'm sorry , excuse me . Oh . It 's my old boss now . Can you give just me a second ? She only calls when it 's important . Or when she gets lost . - What do you want ? - New case , I need you . You sent me packing this morning , and you owe me six months ' back pay . What makes you think I 'm gonna drop everything just because you call ? Because it 's important . And because that 's just the kind of girl you are . Dunham ? - Drop what you 're investigating . - Who the hell are you ? I 'm a man who doesn 't let his feelings get him into trouble . Don 't stick your heart out where it doesn 't belong . I 'm sorry . Does that hurt ? Oh , no , no , no . It feels great , actually . Please , keep doing it . I can 't believe you got sucked back into business over true love . You know , that 's your problem , isn 't it ? You 're always looking for something that doesn 't even exist . Hey , that 's not true . I 'm not looking for someone who 's gonna give his heart to the world . I mean , somewhere in the universe , there 's gotta be a guy who 'll keep me warm when I 'm cold , feed me when I 'm hungry and maybe , on occasion , take me dancing . Huh . That 's odd . It looks like it 's healing . What kind of weapon did you say he used ? Well , nothing that I 'd ever seen before . It was like some kind of laser . This is the same kind of wound that killed Rachel . So the man who attacked me is the same man who took her heart . - Draw it . - Draw what ? The weapon . I have an idea . Yeah , the patent on this device was taken out last year . Pretty cool little device , if I recall . It 's patented by this whiz-bang tech company out of Manhattan . Boy , I wish I could work somewhere like that . Big outfit , all kinds of spy stuff . - They go by the name of- - - Massive Dynamic . You can 't go in there , Miss Dunham . A few hours ago , a man attacked me with that . Told me to forget I 'd ever heard the name Peter Bishop . Now , I can the Feds or you can tell me the truth . You choose , lady . Bring me the file on the Quantum Laser . The device was developed here in our biomedical research lab . It was designed as a surgical tool . Several months ago , one of our prototypes was stolen . But tell me , this man that attacked you was he bald , with an odd cadence to his voice ? - Who is he ? - Not he , they . We call them The Watchers . These people are dangerous . And they don 't make idle threats . You should know what you 're getting into , Ms. Dunham . - She was lying . - Who ? Nina Sharp . She was lying , wasn 't she ? - What makes you think that ? - I don 't know . I just don 't trust her . Smart girl . You 're getting ahead of the narrative but you 're thinking along the right lines because Detective Olivia didn 't trust her either . Now ... . - Hello ? - It 's me . You got anything ? Nina Sharp 's company , Massive Dynamic . The founder and CEO is a guy named William Bell . You ever heard of him ? No . Should I have ? Well , it seems he 's a sort of scientific Christopher Columbus . He 's always searching for what 's right on the edge of our imagination . But here is the interesting part . In the past few years no one has seen him . No press conferences , no public appearances . It 's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth . Okay . So , what 's that got to do with Peter Bishop ? - I don 't know . But that 's weird , right ? - Yeah , listen , I gotta go . - Hey , Dunham ? - Yeah ? - Be careful . - Okay , Mom . I have news . Is it safe to talk ? Of course . No one can hear us . What is it ? - I found it . - The glass heart ? - You were right , Peter Bishop has it . - So where is he ? Where 's the boy ? We don 't know yet . But we 'll find him . Hell , that 's fabulous news . Well done , Nina . - I knew you could do it . - William , I 've been going out of my mind . By utilizing the heart 's power we 'll be able to create a stable door between universes . And after all this time , we can finally be together again . I know , my love . Excuse me . She is awake . I see . I suppose I should feel sorry for you , Ms. Dunham . None of these should have been your concerns . The truth is I did everything to protect you . I warned you to stay away . But you didn 't listen . Now you 've given me no choice . So you 're gonna send me somewhere far away where I won 't be able to tell anybody what you wanna do with that heart ? Not quite . Go ahead , Mr. Gemini . No , no . No . No . No , no . No ! Help me ! I heard you were looking for me . - Feeling better ? - Is a hot shower better than drowning in a pine coffin ? Much . Thank you . I take it you don 't live here . No , but nobody else does either . Seemed like a pretty good place to hide out . - But this is yours . - Yeah . What is it ? Are you hungry ? So how did you know I was drowning ? Coffee ? Yeah , one sugar , thanks . Like I told you before , I heard somebody was looking for me . A cop named Olivia Dunham . So I was following you . Someone 's been giving you false information . I 'm not a cop . - I 'm a private detective . - I see . - You like jazz ? - Jazz ? Miles , Duke , Louis , John Coltrane . You can tell a lot about a person from the music they listen to . And whether or not they dance . Well , jazz , not so much , but dancing sure . Well , I guess we 're opposites . I hate to dance . I 'd take you , though . You would ? Why 's that ? I don 't know , seems like it would be fun . You look like a good dancer . Huh . This is very nice , and I 'm grateful you saved my life but I know who you are , and I know what you did . Wanna know why I was looking for you ? Dr. Walter Bishop hired me . I know you took his glass heart . Is that what he told you ? That I stole his heart ? What else did Walter Bishop tell you ? That without his heart , he would die . And that all the good he does for this world would die with him . Guess I 'm not the only one who 's been given false information . - What ? You 're saying that 's not true ? - Come with me . A hundred and forty seven pins . Each one represents a child injured by Walter Bishop . Injured how ? Walter 's invented many things . Wondrous things . That much is true . But what he didn 't tell you is where his ideas come from . Elephants , rainbows , licorice sticks . They come from the dreams of children . He steals children 's dreams and he replaces them with nightmares . That 's what this is . A pattern of destruction . Of damaged kids . Shattered innocence . - Who else knows about this ? - Nobody . I worked for him for years , and I didn 't even know . It 's why I was willing to die so that he could live . It 's your heart ? I was born with it . And I was willing to give it to Walter . Because of all the good he 's done . Because of all the good he could do . I thought that his life was so much more valuable than mine . At least until I learned the truth . Walter Bishop isn 't responsible for all the goodness in the world . But he is responsible for so much evil . - Oh , hell . - What is it ? They 've found us . I knew you were a good dancer . You really cut a rug out there . Well , you 're not so bad yourself . I need your help , Olivia . I 'm dying . Okay , I got them . So , what do I do ? Well ... - ... you ever play that game Operation ? - Yeah . It 's just like that , except in reverse . You gotta put those batteries into my chest but whatever you do , don 't touch the nerve endings . And what if I do ? Don 't . Okay . Hey . You 're gonna be fine . Just go slow and take them one at a time . Okay . So , what made you wanna be a detective ? I don 't know . I guess that I just always knew what it was I was meant to do . And what 's that ? To care for people . Well , then who cares for you ? Okay . I did it . Okay . Just one more . Must be nice to know who you are . To know your place in the world . So , what about you ? I thought I did . I thought I knew who I was . But I was wrong . Done . Peter ? Peter ? Peter ? Please , Peter . For once in my life I have someone who needs me Someone I 've needed so long For once , unafraid I can go where life leads me And somehow I know I 'll be strong For once in my life I won 't let sorrow hurt me Not like it 's hurt me before For once I have something I know won 't desert me I 'm not alone anymore Peter . Hey . Hey . You did it . Okay , now , you be careful . These batteries aren 't gonna last . We have to get my heart . Those men who attacked us work for Nina Sharp . Nina Sharp isn 't the one who 's got your heart . Then who does ? Put it down , Dr. Bishop . How did you know it was me ? The device , the one that came through the wall I knew that I 'd seen it someplace before . You brought Nina Sharp 's Watchers to your side , didn 't you ? Peter . Peter . I never meant to hurt anyone . I never ... . I can change . You 'll see . I can make up for all the harm I 've done . Peter , please . Who can take a sunrise Sprinkle it with dew ? The candy man can . Peter , please . It 's too late , Walter . There 's some things you can 't undo . Candy man can 'Cause he mixes it with love And makes the world taste good Are you kidding ? That 's not a proper ending . Don 't you know , all good stories start with , " Once upon a time " and they end with , " Happily ever after " ? You don 't know how to tell stories , Uncle Walter . I 'll tell you how the story ends . Peter ? Peter , please . I can change . I can fix the damage I 've done . Please , give me another chance . And Peter looked inside Walter 's eyes and realized there was still goodness inside him . So Peter took his special heart , and with all his might , he split it in two . And the heart was so magical that it still worked . And together they made goodness and lived happily ever after . The end . - Aunt Liv . We had so much fun . - Did you ? That 's great . We played games kind of badly . Then Uncle Walter told me a story . I 'm sorry , Walter . No luck . His ending wasn 't very good . It was sad . But I fixed it for him . Didn 't I , Uncle Walter ? Yes . Yes , my dear , you were right . Yours was a proper ending . Yours was a much better ending , indeed . The boy has not returned . And I do not believe Dr. Bishop remembers my warning . Yes , I am concerned too .

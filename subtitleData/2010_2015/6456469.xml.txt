 Ood ! Yes ! I was wondering where he 'd got to . I thought he 'd just gone for a walk in the Tardis . Must 've wandered off when I popped in the other night ... If it was the other night . You know , I rescued him from the middle of the Androvax Conflict . I was taking him back to the God Sphere . Anyway , he 's not being a nuisance , is he ? - Enjoy your workday experience . - Thanks . Doctor . Doctor ! He , um ... He seems to think that he 's our butler . He 's conditioned to serve . You know the best thing is ... let him do just that , I 'll come and pick him up tonight . Whenever " tonight " is . Oh , no ! Gotta go ! Power drain 's threatening to cause the Tardis to implode . Oh no , that 's bad . Why is it doing that ? No , no , no ! Don 't do that ! Your infusions . How else may I be of service ? - I feel so guilty . - You just eat your breakfast . Mmm !

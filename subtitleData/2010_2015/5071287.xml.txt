 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Hello there . Agent Sally Stukowski . FBI . I 'm in charge of this investigation . We 're trying to help . Well , we specialize in " weird . " We can help you . We--we know stuff . I 'm Claudia . Douglas . Douglas Fargo . Everyone just calls me Fargo . Okay . Doug . I spent some time in a psychic ... Research facility . And I just told you I was in an institution , so I guess today 's sharing day . ♪ Try not to think about you ♪ ♪ try not to feel this way at all ♪ No more agents , dude . What the warehouse needs are interns . Is that the whole order ? Yeah , party fuel for a super-fun night of inventory reports . You know , Claude , I think sometime you ought to bring your guilt-box down here and rock out the locals . [ Imitates guitar ] No . - No ? - No . Come on . You 're really good . You got to get out of your comfort zone . You play at the BB all the time . Where no one can hear me . Especially you . Quit eavesdropping on me . What 's wrong with you ? [ Cell phone ringing ] Here . Hold this . What 's wrong with you ? Artie , unblock your number . Yes , I made sure they used the vanilla sprinkles as well as the soy whip . Soy whip ? No , no , no , I don 't need soy whip . I need to speak with someone named Claudia . - Who is this ? - This is Gibson . And he told me to call this number in case something went wrong with the beta test , and something has gone wrong , really , really wrong , and I 'm the only one that 's not vegging . Hey , hey , hey , Gibson , de-spaz for a second . Who told you to call me ? Fargo . And I think he 's gonna die . [ Device beeping ] [ Mysterious music ] ♪ Warehouse 13 3x06 ♪ Don 't Hate the Player Original Air Date on August 15 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = This is the address that Gibson dude gave me . Ugh . It reminds me of college . Hey , Gibson ? Back here ! Oh , thank God you guys came . They 're , like , freaking out right now . I don 't know what 's going on . I don 't know what to do . Oh , my God , Fargo . Oh , no , don 't touch the headband ! [ Electricity crackles ] What do you think was the first thing I tried ? Is this his heart rate ? How long has it been that high ? Few minutes . It goes up and down . All right , uh , Gibson , is it ? Who are you , why are we here , and why is Fargo jacked into the matrix ? They 're playing a video game , and I don 't know how to get them to stop . Oh . Oh , wait , wait , wait , wait . In here . This way ... Fargo can tell you himself . Greetings , potential investors . Ni hao . My name is Dr. Douglas Fargo , world renowned scientist , inventor ... Dreamer . I 'm here today to talk to you about an exciting new business venture , one that will change the standard of video game entertainment for all humankind . Welcome to Fargames . Six months ago , two M.I.T. graduates , Jerry Hoffler and Gibson Ryce came to me with an idea . They called it the braid- - braid . The braid creates artificial feelings- - sights , sounds , smells . A full sensory experience . You don 't just play the game , you live it . Fargames- - imagining greater . So , uh , Fargo and Jerry were beta testing this game ? Yeah . Things were going great , but after a few hours , their ... Pulses started to spike . Look , Gibson , I.T. problems really aren 't our area of expertise . Isn 't there someone at Eureka that could- - The braid never worked , did it ? [ Dramatic music ] The human brain wouldn 't accept the lie of artificial reality . But Fargo thought he found something that would help . They drank out of it before they started the test . Damn . That little geek found an artifact . Agent Jinks . Thanks so much for coming on such short notice . Agent Stukowski . Considering you tried to have me arrested the first time we met , I was a little surprised to get an S.O.S. call from you . Oh , no , that thing in Denver , honey , water under the bridge . Reason I called is I 've got a real humdinger here , and since your organization specializes in " weird , " I thought I 'd take a chance . So you came alone ? Not ... quite . How 'd that little nerd get his hands on an artifact ? I 'll kill him ! I 'll call Leena and she can help . Eureka . Oh , did you just figure something out ? What ? Uh , no . Who 's this ? FBI Agent Sally Stukowski , this is Artie- - Agent Nielsen . Pleasure , yes . Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule . Y 'all must be busy with whatever it is you do . You want to just walk us through the scene ? Yes . Eric Johnson , 47 , curator of the Hobbes Gallery , takes a dive out of this window here . Official ruling is suicide , but I don 't think so . Coworkers and family say that he was excited about the exhibit opening next week . No signs of depression of erratic behavior . Hmm . And ... And , uh , were there any witnesses ? Uh , no , he was working late . Report says he was the only one in the building . I 'm sort of missing the weirdness here . Coroner 's report . That 's Mr. Johnson ? He only fell two stories , but the impact trauma , it 's like he was skydiving without a parachute . That is weird . And disgusting . So thoughts , ideas , suggestions , hypotheses ? I got nothing . Coroner 's right . Suicide . Oh , beg your pardon . No , that 's safety glass . He couldn 't have just jumped through it . Oh , he took a running jump from all the way across the room , built up enough force , and went right through the glass . What ? Saw it on Mythbusters . So that 's it , then ? 'Fraid so . Good luck . Steve ? [ Cell phone rings ] Oh . Oh , you know what ? This is the manager of the building . Man thinks I work for him . I 'll show you out in a second . We 'll show ourselves out . Thanks . Perfect . I could tell you were lying . Yeah , that never gets old . Take a look at that oil painting . It 's right across from the broken window . It is a van Gogh . Stormy Night . Been missing for years . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . It 's bounced around Europe since World War I , and death has followed that painting wherever it 's been spotted . If it 's an artifact , why don 't we just take it ? And tell them what ? " Your priceless painting murdered a man , please can we have it " ? Oh , Stukowski called us in . Yeah , and I have no intention of giving her any more clues as to what it is we do . No , no , no , no . If we 're gonna get that painting ... We 're gonna have to steal it . Does it look anything like this ? It 's an exact match . No effect on Fargo or Jerry . The warehouse has the fourth cup . All right , so what 's the story ? Well , the tea set belonged to Beatrix Potter , 19th century English writer . Peter Rabbit . I love that book . Yeah , the league of evil British writers strikes again . The rest of the set has been on Artie 's most wanted list for years . Hey , " Used for brewing teas " derived from rare fungi " cultivated by Potter during her time as a mycologist . " The tea is known to stimulate the precuneus region of the brain . " It 's the imagination center . I bet that 's why Potter got into writing children 's stories . So , what ? The tea set made her trip bunnies ? Fargo must have figured it 'd help do what the brain couldn 't . You know , make the brain experience total reality inside the game . I 've seen Potter 's first editions in the warehouse library . Leena , can you send us the scans ? - You got it . - Claudia ! [ Gasping ] Uh , he just started doing this . We got to get him out of there . I 've been reading the schematics , and I don 't think there 's anything we can do ... From out here . So if you could never get ' em to work , why 'd you make so many ? Yeah , well , Fargo 's not the most linear thinker . Hey , I upgraded the hardware . You should be able to incorporate that into the game . - You did this in 20 minutes ? - Quicker than Domino 's . Myka , that 's an in-game communicator , so you 'll be able to talk to us once we go inside . Claudia and I 'll go in , find them , and boogie on back out to reality . Game on , urban warrior . Yup . Okay . You both need avatars to play in the game . What do you want to be ? Make me a badass . What kind of game is this anyway ? I just did the hardware . It 's some sword and sorcery thing that Fargo wrote . Think he 's a wizard ? I was gonna be a warlock priest . I 'll just be myself . Okay . Are you sure it won 't work without the tea ? We tried . If you don 't drink , the game 's just a game . Fargo wanted more than that . [ Continues gasping ] Yeah , looks like he got it . Well , I 'll be here to make sure that nothing goes wrong . Or ... More wrong . Oh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh . No , no , no . I was playing Frogger when you were just a tadpole . Just to make sure the pop out works , right ? Mm . Oh , man . That--that 's minty . I hope there 's no caffeine in there , ' cause- - Well , his--his pulse is still normal . Uh , dude ? Dude ? You there ? Yeah , yeah . Hello ? - Can you hear me ? - Loud and clear . Oh , wow . It 's awesome in here . Is that the- - ? Oh , man . Dude , uh , look down at your belt . You see the controller ? The white thing with the button on top ? Right . Push the button . Ooh , you guys got to see this . Fill ' er up . Is it me , or does that look a little bit like ... ? Yep , Fargo made a Warehouse 13 video game . And somewhere in there , Fargo 's having a seizure . [ Sighs ] Whoa . And you 're a stripper . - What ? No , I 'm--I 'm a gladiator . It 's cool , right ? Yeah . Nice skirt . Nice ears . Huh ? Poi--pointy ? I 'm an elf ? I said " myself . " Well , you need to enunciate . Now run to your tree and get me some cookies . Halt , players ! Artie ? I am General Arthur of the Queen 's Royal Best . Now , players , prepare for a life-ending quest through bleak , barren lands . You will stumble and blunder , trying to find a world of bizarre , endless wonder . [ Both scream ] Whoa . You see this ? Yeah . Don 't really believe it , though . [ Laughs ] Welcome , players , to Fortress 13 , the most wondrous place that 's never been seen , hidden deep in the valley of the Land of Bad . Filled with dangerous relics . Some evil , some ... [ Laughs ] Mad . [ Laughs ] Artie 's gonna be deeply pissed . The princess is imprisoned high in the Black Tower , her life slipping away with each passing hour . True heroes you are to take this brave test . Now , will you accept your dangerous quest ? Your generalness , I am Pete-imus Maximus of the Lattimer Legion . This is my faithful squire ... Claudi-elf . We would love to save your princess , but are looking for two royal geeks . True heroes you are to take this grave test . Now will you accept your dangerous quest ? Short , glasses , unnatural attraction to computers ? Now , will you accept your dangerous- - Pete , it 's just a program . Fargo and Jerry must be further on in the game . We 're just gonna have to play along if we 're gonna find ' em . Now , will you accept your dangerous ... Sure , sure , why not ? Welcome , players , to Fortress- - - Both : Yes ! - Ah . Follow the path to the cave of forbidden mystery . There you must collect the Black Tower key , and with it free the princess , and so save the day . Great rewards await those who act the right way . Cave of forbidden mystery , huh ? Sounds cheery . [ Device buzzing ] Myka-mus . Pete , how 's it going in there ? Well , so far , so good . No sign of the Parker Brothers yet , but we 're on a quest , and I have a really cool sword . Oh , oh . What did I get ? I got a ... Vial of purple goo . Great . I wanted nunchucks . Okay , look , you have to find Fargo and Jerry . I don 't know how much longer their hearts can beat at this rate . Copy that . Crash Bandicoot out . Okay . Let 's go find the scarecrow , shall we ? Come , Toto . [ Adventurous music ] ♪ ♪ Artie ! Hey ! Will you listen to me ? I 've been up and down this place . I know security systems . And this one is far too sophisticated , and probably- - [ security system beeps ] Wasting my time ? I know . I never get tired of that . Ah , ah . Oh , I 'm sorry . My burglary skills are rusty . We 're warehouse agents . This isn 't burglary . This is creative snagging . Well , I 'll be getting my own lawyer . Wha--whoa , whoa , whoa . What is that ? Some sort of weapon ? You know , you just add more time to the sentence , right ? [ Clang ] Three , two , one . [ Snaps ] It 's called an eclipse . Deactivates all laser protection for 42 minutes and 59 seconds . Why 42 minutes and 59 seconds ? That 's how long Dark Side of the Moon is . You 're a Floyd fan ? Dude , have you seen laser Floyd ? Dude , I 've got Roger Waters name tattooed on my neck . No , I 'm not a Floyd fan . Thought you two might be back . Guess I was right about all that weirdness after all . Uh , Agent Stukowski , this isn 't ... Steve , Steve , Steve , Steve . Agent Nielsen , either you include me , or I activate the alarm . Your choice . [ Gasping ] [ Computer beeps ] This is not the Peter Rabbit I remember . Oh , man . There 's some serious copyright infringement going on here . Wait . We passed Seabiscuit here 20 minutes ago . Oh , nertz . We 've been going in circles . Classic video game trope . We should have seen this coming . [ Woman groaning ] Hey , are you all right ? Wait , Claudia , we don 't know what it is . Well , it 's obviously trapped . And didn 't General Arthur say that great rewards await those who act the right way ? And helping this whatever that is could be- - Acting the right way . Fair enough . Stand back . I 'll use my trusty sword . [ Video game beeps ] [ Yells ] Ah ! Ah , yow ! There 's that full-sensory experience Fargo was talking about . Silly gladiator . Disco ball 's an artifact . And artifacts need to be neutralized , right ? [ Groans ] Thank you , player . Leena . Look , wings . Yes , wings . You freed me from Carter 's curse , and in return , I will show you the way to your destination . Great . More yellow road . For you , young elf , a special reward for using your wits to solve my plight , instead of thuggish force . Thuggish can be good sometimes . [ Video game beeps ] High score . That is a boon . Should you find yourself in need , you may call on Leena of the eagle people . How does she get off the ground with those things ? They 're wings . Yeah , the wings probably help . Hey , wait up . [ Growls softly ] Oh , no , he didn 't . He actually copied the dark vault . So not cool . Fargo ! Get out here right now ! Hey , hey . Key . The key . " There you must collect the Black Tower key . " With it , free the princess , and so save the day . " Claudia , wait ! Quicksand ? This must be the deathy part of the game General Artie talked about . Hey , there 's someone in there . [ Video game beeps ] Oh . Oh . Come on . That 's it . [ Gasps ] Come on ! Come on . Dougie . [ Both grunt ] Oh , thank you . Thank you . Okay , okay , okay . Hugs later . Both of you still have your controllers . Hey , hey , hey , easy there , grabby . We have to find Jerry . Where is he ? Yeah , and what happened to your controller ? He happened . [ Ominous music ] Holy crap . Who invited the Grim Reaper ? Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey . Look , I am a gladiator , and I demand that you- - okay ... You know , sometimes in a video game , I think it 's all right to run ! You know , I was kind of digging Fortress 13- - neat costumes , rhyming Artie- - but that in there , not okay . That was not part of the game . The quicksand , that executioner guy , none of this is supposed to be happening . Me and Jerry were just playing along , and then all of a sudden things got weird and scary . Weird and scary . Sounds like the artifact did something . Yeah , which is why we don 't play with them , Fargo , or mix ' em with video games . Yeah , okay , I 'll admit , not my finest idea , but it was so innocent . Beatrix Potter 's tea set . What 's the worst that could happen ? Talking bunnies ? I think we just met the worst that could happen , and that talking bunny has a very big axe . [ Device buzzes ] Hey . Pete , Fargo 's breathing is back to normal . Yeah , yeah , we found the little guy . Jerry 's still awol . And I think the tea set 's starting to put a little bit of a whammy on us . You find anything else out ? Potter 's first editions are more like dream journals than stories , and they 're dark . In this one story , Peter Rabbit chews off his own leg to escape farmer McGregor 's trap . That was not on Reading Rainbow . Guys , what if the tea set doesn 't just enhance your imagination ? What if it also brings out the darker parts of--of your subconscious ? I used to have nightmares about drowning . And you wound up in quicksand . That must be what 's happening . The tea set brings your fears to life in the game . Fantastic . What about the executioner ? Well , that must come from Jerry . Most of my nightmares are about me losing my hair . - Me too ! - Really ? Yeah , do ever put the- - Hey , you can trade beauty tips later . I 'll figure out what 's going on in Jerry 's head , and you guys just find him , and then get out of there . So without the controllers , how do we get out of the game ? Well , the only way to shut off the braid would be to finish the game . Which Jerry would know . He must have gone to the Black Tower . [ Thunder rumbles ] Right . Save the princess , finish the game . To the Black Tower ! [ Thunder rumbles ] I never thought I 'd say this , but let 's save us a princess . How am I supposed to know what 's in Jerry 's subconscious ? All we ever talk about is video games and fantasy football . Why are all men emotionally stunted ? I need a woman . Yeah , you and me both . No , no , I mean , I need to find ... Are you gonna get me a woman ? Because if you are , I 'd like to change . Okay , Jerry 's girlfriend , the girl on the mug , who is she ? Oh , uh , Sarah . Or Susan . Melissa ? You don 't know her name ? Hey , look , for the last year , I 've been working 24 / 7 on building the braid . I don 't even really remember your name . What are you doing ? I am going through Jerry 's calls . Okay , most of them are from Fargo . Aha . Hannah . He called Hannah last week . Right . Hannah . Yeah , right . Hannah . So you 're just gonna substitute a forgery for a priceless work of art , and hope nobody notices ? Shh , shh . There--there 's someone there . Can you check ? You know it 's blank , right ? Observe . Nice . It 's memory paper from Johannes Gutenberg 's printing press . Van Gogh himself wouldn 't know the difference . No one . You 're hearing things . Shut my mouth ! How 'd you do that ? - It 's from Johannes Guten- - - Really ? I ... Don 't know . Yeah , let 's just make the swap , shall we ? Here . Put these on . Ooh , we gonna do some dishes ? Just kidding . So is this like that thing in Denver ? It 's a work of art with bad juju ? Yeah . No . So how we gonna get it out of here ? We have to cut it out , or- - [ sneezes ] Oh , sorry . Dust . Artie . Artie , look . [ Thunder booms ] Get down ! No , no , no ! No , no , no , no ... Hold on ! Hold on ! No , no , no ! Ah ! [ Moans ] This thing is activated by a puff of air . When you sneezed , that 's what triggered the effect . Who in the hell are you people ? Ha , yeah , well , if I had a nickel . Come on . We 're gonna swap this out still . Hello ? What 's going on ? Hannah , I--I 'm ... Jerry ? Oh , my God . Uh , don 't touch the headband . Jerry . Jerry . Jerry , come on , wake up . Jerry . Jerry . What 's wrong with him ? Look , I can 't even pretend to understand what you 're trying to tell me . Lost in the game ? Do you work for Fargo too ? No . No , no , no . God no . I 'm just here to lend a hand . Hannah , look , what 's going on in there with them , it has to do with your boyfriend 's subconscious . I need to know more about him . Jerry 's not my boyfriend anymore . We broke up last week . Last week ? What , you think our breakup has something to do with this ? Just--just tell me what happened , okay ? I wanted more . Something serious . Jerry kept saying that he wanted the same thing , but the time wasn 't right . He wanted Fargames to get off the ground , and I believed him . I even found the ring that he bought me , but he never asked . I waited for months , and finally I just told him it was over . I haven 't really talked to him since . Is he gonna be okay ? Well , not as smooth as when we got Whistler 's Mother , but not a bad grab . Oh , well , that 's something I 'd rather not know about . No- - [ electricity crackles , alarm wailing ] Dark Side of the Moon is longer than that . Sally ! She 's got the van Gogh . Ooh , man . My kilt is chafing . Thanks for coming , by the way . Believe me , if a black hole or an evil robot shows up at the warehouse , you 're on my speed dial too . I hope the princess has some gold bond . Just let me open the door , okay ? Can 't wait to meet this princess . Uh , before we go inside , there 's something I should tell you . [ Video game beeps ] What ? Brave heroes ! You 've come to save me ! I 'm the princess ? Really ? You didn 't see this coming ? I will compose a ballad in your honor . [ Giggles ] [ Bike horn honks ] What are those things on my chest ? Freckles ? Okay , uh , game over . Princess saved . What are we- - what are we doing here ? [ Man crying ] [ Video game beeps ] Jerry ? Jerry ! Guys , this is Jerry . It--how did you get here ? What 's wrong with him ? Aah ! Aah ! Oh , crap . Brave hero . You 've come to rescue me . Aah ! Okay . All right . It 's just you and me . It 's just you . Pete , come on , wake up . Wake up . [ Growling ] Wait , Hannah , please- - Pete . Pete , Pete , Pete . Who 's Hannah ? - Pete . - Come on , wake up , Pete . No , no , no . [ Grunts ] Aah ! Whew . Somebody needs a tic tac . Um , okay , what is happening ? What 's going on ? Uh , everyone 's heart rates just started elevating . Oh , God . Jerry 's is almost at 230 . How much faster can it go before it just explodes ? Pete , can you hear me ? What 's going on in there ? Myka , is Jerry still alive ? Yes , but his pulse is skyrocketing . Listen , I think his anxiety comes from his ex-girlfriend . Yeah , whose doesn 't ? Hannah , yeah , I think we just met her . Nice girl . Big axe . Pete , listen , you need to stay calm . In the story ... [ Static interfering ] ... literally consumed his fears ... Uh , what- - am I--am I losing you ? [ Sharp static ] Ugh . Of course I am . Great . The line went dead . Myka , Gibson , is anyone in reality reading me ? I don 't understand . It should be working . Possibly my fault . Well , I started thinking about how much scarier it 'd be if we lost communications . Did you not hear the part about this place making our fears real ? Hey , it 's your fault we 're stuck in here , Paul . And what 's the deal with Puff the Magic Dragon out there ? Yeah ? Whose fear is that ? Uh , well , no , that 's actually just part of the game . What ? Dragons are awesome . Besides , to get past it , all we need is the Dagger of Josephine ! [ Buzzer ] [ Clears throat ] I said , " The Dagger of Josephine ! " [ Buzzer ] Which I may have forgot to program into the game . A game . A game . That 's right . This is a game . So how about if I just close my eyes , jump , and float gently to the ground ? Wait . Hold the phone , Spartacus . Boon goes the dynamite . Excellent . I 'll get to see them again . Her . Leena . I 'll get to see Leena again . [ Wings flutter ] Greetings , player . Have you chosen your boon ? And her two humongous wings . Can you fly us out of here to where Jerry is ? If that is your wish , my steed will aid you . Steed ? [ Creature roars ] [ Creature screeches ] Shotgun . - Oh . - Yes . [ Police radio chatters ] Stukowski played us . Why would she want an artifact ? That van Gogh 's worth hundreds of millions of dollars . Probably doesn 't even care it 's an artifact . She 's a sworn FBI Agent . Hundreds of millions . Look , why don 't we just tell the cops who we are ? We 're on the same team . Yeah . NSA and ATF , both burglarizing an art gallery . That won 't lead to too many questions . [ Door opens ] All right , gents . Let 's all go down to 1 Police Plaza , shall we ? My boss wants to meet you . Hold it . Sally Stukowski , FBI . These men are working for me on a very important terrorism case . Terrorism . In an art gallery ? Black market sale of art has been used to fund numerous radical organizations in the past few years . These men were helping me to identify a potential forgery . We 're nearing the end of a ten-month operation , and I need a confirmation tonight . I already have full authority on this crime scene from my field office . Do I need to take it up with your Lieutenant ? Um , take ' em . Chop , chop . Told you . Hannah , why are you doing this ? Look , I 'm sorry . I couldn 't ask . I just- - I just- - look , I was afraid . I was afraid you 'd say no . I--I wanted to . I was afraid ! I couldn 't commit . I 've had so many relationships that ended like that . She can 't really cut off his head , though , right ? I mean , not for real . I don 't know . I mean , if his fear kills him in here , it might be able to kill him out there . You okay ? It 's just this fear thing . You ever try so hard not to think about something till it 's all you can think about ? Yeah , all the time . Miss Donovan . This is another delusion , dear . Dr. Michener ? Who 's that ? No , he 's nobody . He 's not real . He 's not here . None of this is real , Claudia . You 're just an emotionally troubled young woman . No . Your brother is dead . [ Screaming ] No ! No ! Let me go ! You 're not real ! You 've been living a delusion . One you created to make yourself feel safe , a warehouse where you could hide from the real world . But it 's a lie , Claudia . You 've been in this institution the whole time . With me . - Don 't listen to him , Claudia . - No , Claudia , we 're real . Please ! [ Electricity crackling ] No ! Don 't ! You need your treatment , Claudia . Aah ! Aah ! You 've been hiding . You 'll feel better after your treatment . You always do . You know what , Doc ? I do feel better now . Myka . Is that really you ? Yeah . Oh . You went with dominatrix , huh ? Good choice . Don 't make me get my whip . - Are you okay ? - Mm-hmm . Are you okay ? [ Laughs ] I wasn 't expecting a catharsis today , but that actually felt pretty good . Yeah , thanks , Mykes . Okay , guys , look , we have to save Jerry , and get our controllers back from evil Hannah . But how ? I mean , she 's been kicking our butt since we got here . Wait . I was stuck in the quicksand , but when I saw you guys , it gave me the courage to pull myself out . Right . And Myka distracted him , but I had to be the one to finish the Doc . You have to take down your own fears . Right . Okay . We got to get traumatized Jerry to nut up before he loses his head . Myka , Claudia , you go talk to him . We 'll distract the ex . Let 's go get medieval on her ass . One , two , three , break ! - Break . - Okay , that 's ... Just- - Sorry I ran off . Didn 't really have much of a choice . Figured I 'd catch up with you two once I got the painting back to a safe place . I don 't really like lying to policemen . Well , trust me , you 're good at it . You have our number , Agent Stukowski ? All right , then . So catch you later . What is it , Artie ? Something . [ Groaning ] Hannah , I never wanted it to end . I just--I just- - I just wanted to be more for you . Hey , you old battle axe ! Hyah ! Oh , you gonna make the super-scary monster face , huh ? She 's gonna make the super-scary monster face . [ Both mocking ] Bring it , bi-atch . How am I doing ? Jerry , everything 's gonna be okay . Doesn 't matter . I 'll never be good enough for her or anybody . Hey , lady ! You had that thing the whole time ? I think we 've established I haven 't thought this through very well . You shall not pass ! Or ... After you . Aah ! Cheater . Come on . Jerry , listen , I know what happened with Hannah , the real one . You love her , but you couldn 't propose . She just would have said no . This place , it magnifies your fear , your--your anxieties . The proposal , okay ? That 's your demon . Don 't let it kill us all . Come on , Jerry . Dig deep . What do you want more than anything in the world right now ? I--I want Hannah . Then make it happen . Go over to her . Okay . - Look her in the eye . - Okay . And tell her how you feel . Okay . Okay . [ Video game beeps ] All right . Let 's go . Aah ! Now , Jerry . Hannah , will you marry me ? Jerry . Congratulations , players . The game is complete . And now let 's all get something to eat . It 's about freakin ' time . Aah , she 's back ! Hannah . Hannah . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . - I love you . I love you too . I love you , I love you , I love you . I like this Hannah better . Well , I thought the giant axe was kind of a turn-on . I officially know way too much about you . [ Laughs ] Hi . I , um ... This is my first time doing anything like this . Uh , a really good friend of mine told me I needed to get out of my comfort zone . Um , and then my worst nightmare sort of told me the same thing , so it 's been a weird couple of days . Um , anyway ... Ti--yeah , tip your barista . Here we go .

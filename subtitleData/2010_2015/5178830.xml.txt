 [ P.A. ] Attention , ladies and gentlemen . For your own safety , we 'd like to remind you not to leave anything unattended today . [ P.A. ] Your attention , please . [ announcements continue indistinctly ] [ tone chimes ] [ P.A. ] May I have your attention , please ? [ announcements continue indistinctly ] Yeah , honey , I should be down in just a moment . The plane just landed . [ heart beating ] MAN : You gotta be kidding me . Restricted items ? That 's ridiculous . AGENT : Sir , I need you to calm down . I know what I 'm allowed to bring in . I 've read these rules and regulations a million times . I missed you so much . You 're my angel . [ voices overlapping and echoing ] What do you mean , flight 's delayed ? I don 't care about seeing the port . Well , that was Big Ben in Europe . Who cares ? What 's going on ? Can someone tell me ? [ heart beating ] [ announcement echoing ] Babe , you need to chill . Let me speak to your supervisor . So why did you even bother coming ? [ heartbeat thumping ] [ heartbeat racing ] [ heartbeat stops ] [ bones crackling ] [ woman panting ] [ growl ] [ women screaming ] Run . [ growls ] [ howls ] [ snarls ] [ growls ] [ crowd screaming ] [ roars ] [ sirens blaring ] Surround the perimeter . Go ! Go ! Go ! [ police dispatch chatter ] [ crowd screaming ] [ screams ] Go ! Go ! Go ! [ gunfire ] [ roar ] [ canine snarls ] [ screams ] [ heart beating ] [ snarling ] [ heart beating ] [ roars ] [ snarling ] [ screams ] [ roars ] When did it happen ? Started around 8 : 30 this morning , Mr. President , and it 's still happening . Contact General Monning at SOCOM . He 's already been sent in , sir , along with detachments from the 75th Ranger Regiment and the 24th STS . We 've also contacted USAMRIID . All units , I want every entrance and exit sealed . No one gets out . That means every damn tunnel , doorway , skyway and jetway . [ screaming continues ] [ alarm blaring ] [ screams ] [ instruments beeping ] Major Hoffman , sir , there 's been an attack on JFK . What 's the chemical agent ? Well , we--we don 't really know , sir . The Army 's dropping in men . But , look , sir , the reports coming in are unbelievable . There 's a chopper standing by right now to take you to New York . Okay . Well , you hold down the fort , Rog . Thanks , man . [ radio ] ... deemed a suspicious person . 24-23-5 . 7-8-3-5 . Code 6 . [ radio ] Colonel Falcons , come in . Yes , sir . We don 't know what we 're dealing with yet , so I want you to use gas only . Keep the casualties to a minimum . Yes , sir . Take us down . [ growling ] [ dripping ] [ beeping ] [ heartbeat slowing ] COL . FALCONS : Gas detonated , General . Good . Standing by . [ crowd clamoring ] [ chanting ] Let them go ! Let them go ! Let them go ! Let them go ! Let them go ! Let them go ! Let them go ! [ crowd faintly clamoring outside ] Name and age ? Listen to me . This- - This is my fault . Name and age , ma 'am ? It doesn 't matter what my damn name is . I was bitten by a wolf . I want you to calm down . Listen to me . My name is Donna Voorhees . I 'm 28 years old . I--I was bitten . I know . I know everybody who was bitten . I want you to take this . It 's gonna keep your heart rate down . [ crowd clamoring ] SOLDIER : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What do you want ? What do you want ? You can 't do this . Get down . I 'm an American citizen ! I have rights ! [ heartbeat pounding ] On the ground now ! Get down , or we will shoot you ! [ bones crackling ] Hands up ! Now ! On the ground ! [ groans ] [ growls ] You don 't understand . It--It was before any of- - [ growl ] [ growling ] [ roaring ] [ crowd silent ] Tag him . Get him inside . Let 's go , people ! Keep it moving ! Did they kill it ? No , of course not . Now take this . Your right arm , please . This is your microchip . It 's for your safety as well as ours . Now just hang in there . Next . SOLDIER : Keep it moving . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! This ain 't no parade . Come on . [ heart beating ] Keep it going . Keep it going . On your feet , sweetheart . I 'm sorry . I think the pills- - I said up ! Ohh ! Get your hands off me ! MAJ . HOFFMAN : Stand down , Corporal ! Did you hear me ? I said stand down . [ heartbeat slows ] Are you okay ? All right , come on . Let 's get you someplace where you can lie down . I see you mistreating these patients again , Parkins , and I will have your court-martialed so fast your head will spin . Do you understand me ? Yes , sir . We need to keep these people calm , keep their heart rates down and keep everybody safe . [ sighs ] Come on . Thank you , Captain . You okay ? Um ... All right . Steady as she goes . Here we go . Okay . Lay back . There you go . Just relax , okay ? Look at that . So you 're a dog lover , too , huh ? I was . I have some mixed feelings now . [ laughs ] Yeah . I 'm , um , a wildlife photographer . Oh , yeah ? Mm . That 's neat . What 's your specialty ? Well , uh , don 't worry , 'cause you 're gonna be back at it soon . We 're gonna get this thing under control , and we 're gonna get all you people here back to your lives , okay ? Can you cure it ? Well , to be honest with you , we 're in the dark . And I 'd be lying to you if I said it wasn 't gonna take some time , but , uh , the first thing we gotta do is find out where it came from . Like a ... Patient Zero ? That 's exactly right . It was ... before ... th-the--the airport ... my bite . You okay ? [ helicopter blades whirring ] Name and age , please . You can call me Susan if it makes you happy . Sir , we 're just trying to help . Great . Then you can start with these damn restraints . Hammond . Carl Hammond , 33 . Your arm , please , Mr. Hammond . You get off on this ... huh ? Locking us up in here like animals , experimenting on us . [ chuckles ] I 'll bet you 're all excited , right ? General , Major Hoffman to see you , sir . Thank you , Captain . General Monning , sir . Major Hoffman . It 's been a while , sir . It has , indeed . Still working with terrorists ? I beg your pardon ? Key suspect of the 2001 anthrax attacks was a USAMRIID scientist , was he not ? That 's right , sir , and I 'm the one who reported him . You trusted a man with all the poison in that place , and people died . We can 't have that here . You understand ? Yes , sir . I trust my men with my life . You know why ? They 've earned it . Well , sir , maybe you could trust your men to use a little common sense when handling the contagious . They 've been provoking them . You play football , Major ? Sir ? Junior year in high school , our team finished dead last in the division . Our coach would come in after every game , slap us on the back and say , " We 'll get 'em next time . " Next year , in came this real mean son of a bitch , kicked our ass every day , and you know what happened ? No , sir . We won the state title . You see , that coach understood the need for discipline . We 're not talking about football players here . They 're casualties , 236 of them , another 150 in body bags . I 'm highly aware of that , sir . And are you aware of the capabilities of these creatures ? Yes , but- - You know if one of them bites you in the arm , puts the saliva in you , you end up here . If it happens to tear out your throat or chomp down on an artery , you end up in the ground . I regret having to infringe on their civil liberties . I do , but our duty is to defend this nation and our citizens from all threats . And that is exactly my point , sir . The calmer we keep them , the better it is for everybody . I 'll be sure to brief my men on the proper security procedures . That 's my job . And you concentrate on your job , fluffing pillows and changing bedpans . Yes , sir , and I 'm also heading up the CDC search for a cure , and I 'm reporting directly to the President- - You can oversee all you like . Just remember your rank here , Major . Heh . Heh . Relax , Hoffman . We 're in this together . I 'd like to start with the airport , sir . If we 're lucky , perhaps some of the surveillance cameras picked up the first- - [ roaring ] [ prisoners screaming ] Report . Falcons , come in . Where 'd it go ? All right . There 's no bullets unless it 's completely necessary . Remember they 're human beings . Man , how 'd this happen ? Oh , my God . Sweet Jesus . [ roars ] [ screaming ] That 's enough , Colonel . I said that 's enough ! That is a human being , remember ? That man just killed four people . Remember that , Major . I--I couldn 't help ... You know , I should- - I should report you . GEN . MONNING : Colonel Falcons , come in . Falcons here . Tell me you got it . We got it . Good man . Bring it downstairs . Right away . [ wind blowing ] [ gasping ] GEN . MONNING : You killed four of my men , Mr. Hammond . Who 's there ? I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to kill ' em . I understand . Don 't like it , but I understand . Self-preservation , the instinct of every living organism on Earth . A computer , on the other hand , lacks instinct , and yet we rely on them to fight our wars . My point is we depend too much on technology . Human error can be just as dangerous , sir . Oh , don 't get me wrong , Falcons . There 's a time and place for machines , but at the end of the day , it 's boots on the ground that win wars . What do you want from me ? I want you to serve your country , son . Bring him in . W-What in the hell is going on in here ? Let 's see how tough you are . Administer the serum . What 's that for , sir ? [ heartbeat racing ] Let 's see what these things can do . [ both roaring ] [ chuckles ] Ooh . [ snarling ] Oh . [ howls ] [ roars ] [ bones crackling ] [ coughs ] Mr. Hammond . I had a feeling about him . Count yourselves lucky , men . You 're witnessing a new era , the most significant advance in warfare since the Predator drone . Put it down . [ gunshot ] Transmission occurs through saliva , not by blood , so anyone with a nonlethal bite wound becomes immediately infected , and as soon as their heart rate spikes , they become feral and lash out at anyone in their way . GEN . MONNING : You believe there 's a cure ? Theoretically we can synthesize one if we have antibodies to use as a blueprint . If we can find Patient Zero , they may have that blueprint . Excuse me , General . Could I , uh , have a word with you , sir ? Of course , Major . Uh , in private . Excuse me . I just saw a man in the coroner 's office who had his throat torn out . That was Mr. Hammond 's work , the man you chased down earlier . He attacked again , and we had to act . Both men were killed in the process . Well , I 'd really like to see that surveillance tape . Of course , Major . Meanwhile , I 'm gonna go down to the airport . With any luck , perhaps I can identify Patient Zero . Excuse me . Major Hoffman , Dr. Ellen Gordon , CDC . Nice to meet you . Would you please look for any signs of anxiety or erratic behavior among passengers in the security footage ? That seems to be the primary indicator of an impending morphosis . Start in Customs . Witnesses report seeing the first attacks here . Okay . Thank you , Doctor . Thank you . General . Mm-hmm . We don 't want to keep you from your work , Doctor . Yes , sir . You see , Colonel ? Men like Hoffman , all they want is reassurance that we 're all on the same side . But , sir , are you sure we want a cure ? It 'll be produced on a mass scale . Only if its discovery got out . I 'd be more than happy to keep Hoffman quiet . He 's just doing his job . He just wants to understand the canines ' origins and behavior . I want to see if they can track a target . I think this little excursion of his may present us all with an opportunity to get what we want . Like I said , cooperation . [ helicopter whirring ] [ radio dispatch chatter ] Major Hoffman , USAMRIID . What the hell ? Major Hoffman . Max Stevens , Director of Border Customs and Security at JFK . Would you , uh , come with me , please ? One of those things got into the surveillance hub and destroyed the place , so security cameras are useless , but I got something better . These haven 't even been made public yet . We 're the first to install them after Dubai . Check it out . Wow . Oh , yeah . That is incredible . You can see every hair , every wrinkle , every detail . And this , this happened before the attack ? 4 1 / 2 minutes before . Unfortunately , this was the next . [ sighs ] See , the system only takes an image every five minutes , so by the time it took this one , the outbreak had already started . Every detail . Could you go back to the last image ? [ image pulses ] [ image pulsing ] Wow . Recognize her ? Yeah , it 's that wildlife photographer . Think there 's any chance the camera survived ? [ scoffs ] You kidding me ? That 's professional-grade Japanese engineering . That thing is built for the field . It 'll take a licking and keep on ticking . You have it ? Yeah . I got it . Come on . SLR 's a good camera . There 's 10 times the resolution of most point-and-shoots . Of course , most people don 't realize that . I can 't tell you how many things get left behind when people are trying to make a flight , as if it 's worth losing 2K on a laptop . This is like my own Fort Knox in here . Let 's see . Photography . Ah , here we go . Eh , hardly a scratch . Thanks . [ clears throat ] [ helicopter whirring ] Need another look ? I got it . Then you have your mission . I get this done , you 'll keep your word , right ? Absolutely . Your family will be transferred from Wards to a private facility . Look at this . You see that ? That 's the day before JFK . Heh . It happened before . Huh ? Look , that 's what she was trying to tell me . She got bitten before she got to the airport . General , Hoffman here . I think we found Patient Zero . Her name 's Donna Voorhees . Time to go to work . [ heartbeat pounding ] Now ! We know she came in on Canadian ... [ snarling ] Stop ! I don 't want to kill you . [ clears throat ] Okay ? I don 't want to hurt you . Just you stay calm . [ grunting ] Now listen to me . There 's still part of you that 's human . You understand that ? [ growls ] Good . So you 're the one who 's in control here . Okay ? Okay ? You stay calm . [ growls ] No ! [ groaning ] [ bones crackling ] [ wind blowing ] General , Hoffman 's still alive . Could you do me a favor and find out everything you can about Donna Voorhees- - where she came from , where she went , who she might have come in contact with ? What are you looking for ? Well , I need solid evidence that she was bitten before she walked into that terminal . Gotta make sure no one else was infected . You got it . All right . Thank you . Yeah . Yeah , it 's a black wolf . They 're very rare , most common in North America , uh , the result of domesticated dogs mating with feral wolves . Early Canadian settlers , they thought they were wolfmen . Okay , so we have this wildlife photographer ... Right . So she goes to Canada . She takes a picture of a wolf . Obviously she gets a little too close . Bites her , and she gets back on the plane . She travels back to New York , ends up infecting the whole damn airport . I uploaded an image on the , uh , system mainframe . If I 'm right , it should be our girl . General , I put a call in to the White House- - Let 's not jump the gun , Hoffman . Wait . Wait . What ? We need to get our facts lined up . If you 're right about Voorhees , the President will be the first to know . But , General , there 's- - I think it 's time we called the White House and let them know that Major Hoffman can no longer be trusted . Mr. Taylor . Yes , sir . Get DOD on the line . Get me Secretary Woods . Right away , sir . Find this girl . Yes , sir . MAN : You kidding ? They ain 't never letting us out . They want to study us , make us turn canine . They want to tinker with us , and before you know it , they 'll want to breed us . This is a risky play , General . Great risk yields great reward , Mr. Secretary . Our forces are overextended and underfunded . The potential edge these creatures provide could ensure our national security for decades , and the applications are limitless . I certainly hope you know what you 're doing , Chris , because if we lose control of this thing , it 'll make smallpox look like a bad rash . We are taking every precaution . What about the CDC and USAMRIID ? Dr. Gordon and her people are in line for now . But Major Hoffman , on the other hand ... Do we have the image yet ? Yes , sir . Putting it on-screen now . [ radio chatter ] Have you guys seen this woman ? Perfect . Mr. Compassion . That way ? Target located . Tranquilizers only . We need her alive . [ panting ] [ heart beating ] [ heartbeat racing ] [ bones crackling ] Out of the way ! [ roaring ] [ prisoners screaming ] Subject just headed north into the park . I want the whole place on lockdown . She 's about 300 yards out in front of you , headed into the trees . Take it around the back . We 'll cut her off at the other end . Right ! To the right ! Get us close . Ho ho ho . [ roars ] Gotcha ! [ roars ] [ roars ] [ snarling ] [ growls ] Hit her with the nets . [ growling ] [ screaming ] Hit her . That 's enough . General ... Patient Zero . MAX : Donna Voorhees , four weeks ago , she chartered a plane from Vancouver to a remote part of Iquani National Park . It 's in the Yukon . 12 days ago , she flew in from Yellowknife . She passed through a full body scan in Toronto before she boarded Canadian Airline flight 323 to JFK and landed at 8 : 05 A.M. MAJ . HOFFMAN : Anything off the body scan ? No . I 'm , uh , checking . I 'm waiting for it to upload . DR. GORDON : Her body underwent complete transformation- - skeletal system , organs , DNA , everything- - mutating into a canine form , at which point she began attacking those around her . Within 23 minutes , 236 people had been infected with the virus . What we rendered here is a simulation of the antibody detecting , then attaching itself to the lupine antigen . This is what should happen . If the wolf host passed the antibodies into the subject , then the composition should be identical . This is what we actually observed from Patient Zero 's blood earlier this morning . She doesn 't hold the antibodies . No , sir . We 've been wasting our time . DR. GORDON : On the contrary , sir . She 's invaluable , for research , observation . What are you doing ? Put her down . What ? ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . General , this is way out of line . She 's a threat . Oh , that 's right , Hoffman . You have trouble spotting threats . Perhaps we should let her live long enough to carry the virus out of this place , like your USAMRIID scientist did . This is different . She 's an innocent civilian . I 'm warning you to stand down . You have no authority here . No ? What about the President of the United States ? You 're only making things worse for yourself , Major . The White House is not gonna listen to someone they believe to be infected . I told them you contracted the virus while searching the airport . What is wrong with you ? General , please , listen to me . You don 't want to do this . She is our only connection to the wolf host . Believe me , we need her alive . General Monning . What is it ? There 's a Max Stevens outside from JFK , says he needed to speak to Major Hoffman . You know this man ? Yeah , I do . Then bring him in . MAN : It ain 't right , rounding us up in this prison , treating us like a bunch of damn lab rats . No one is going to help us . We have to take matters into our own hands . We outnumber them 10 to 1 . It 's time we do something . [ prisoners scream ] What is it ? Ah . Whoa . It 's her . Uh , Major Hoffman had me do some , uh , legwork on Ms. Voorhees , and , uh , well , I--I got something better . I have a full body scan of Ms. Voorhees from Toronto . DR. GORDON : May I ? Yeah . Thank you . She 's got the host DNA inside of her . GEN . MONNING : A tooth . A tooth from the host could contain the antibodies . [ alarm blaring ] She 's bradycardic ! Don 't touch her . You 're crazy ! Curable lupine won 't be a threat . You want to use those things as weapons ? Can you imagine training them- - the heightened senses and strength of the animal , the intellect of a man ? We need a cure , yes , but locked in a vault in the Pentagon so our enemies can 't use it against us . Sit down , Mr. Stevens . We don 't need her . You turn those creatures loose on the battlefield , and that virus will spread around the globe like wildfire . Anybody who 's attacked will carry the virus out with him . Not if each bite carries with it a neurotoxin , an injected neurotoxin that only our wolves are immune to . You 're gonna make them more deadly . [ flatline tone sounding ] You can 't just let her die . She 'll talk . She 'll talk to us . And we need to confirm the link . We could be wrong about the tooth , just like we were wrong about the antibodies being in her blood . General , please , listen to me . She 's our only connection to the host . She can tell us where she last saw it , where it lives . If you kill her , we 'll have absolutely nothing . Go ahead . She 's not breathing . Give me one milligram of epinephrine . She 's V-fib . I 'm gonna have to shock her . [ paddles whine ] Clear . [ monitor beeps , tone resumes ] [ paddles whining ] Clear . [ monitor beeping ] [ tone resumes ] [ paddles whine ] Clear . [ monitor beeping ] She 's stabilizing . Get the tooth , now . I have to cut into her arm . The teeth is lodged beneath her tendons . Then do it . Scalpel . [ heart beating ] [ heart pounding ] [ bones crackling ] [ roars ] [ howling ] [ bones crackling ] [ growling ] [ screams ] General , we need to go now . [ snarling ] [ gasping ] Hey . [ growling ] It 's okay . What the hell are you doing ? It 's okay . Shh . Just trust me , okay ? Don 't move . My name 's Brian . We 're here to protect you , Donna . Good . We 're gonna take care of you now , okay ? It 's gonna be all ... [ bones crackling ] I 'll be damned . [ howling ] [ growling ] [ metal pounding , claws clattering ] [ growling ] [ howl ] Get QRF rolling , priority one containment . Mayday , mayday . This is an emergency broadcast from Wards Island . Patients have breached the compound and are infiltrating Manhattan . They 've taken canine form and considered extremely dangerous . I don 't care how bad this sucks . We 've got an IPO bake-off on Friday , and I need you on this pitch . One more complaint out of you , you- - [ snarling ] Got it . [ clears throat ] Mr. President , we need to get you to a secure location . We 've lost containment on Wards Island . What happened ? Canines have escaped , sir . They 're sweeping south into Manhattan . No , sir . No , that is not true . He only wants you to think we 're infected to keep us out of the way . Now , look , you have to trust me on this . Look , sir , he has taken matters completely into his own hands . No . Mr. President , no , sir . Don , with all due respect , I will not turn myself in . You just hung up on the President . Yeah , well , New York City 's being torn apart as we speak . I can 't just sit around and do nothing . Okay , Donna . Donna , here . I want you to keep this on . It 's gonna monitor your pulse . Whatever you do , don 't let it go above 150 . Look , we 'll explain all this to you later , okay ? Monning 's probably got a hit squad on the way as we speak . We gotta get off this island now , all right ? Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on . [ gunshot ] [ screams ] Get down . DONNA : Why are they trying to kill us ? You may have the cure in your arm , and if the General has his way about it , no one will ever know it exists . Okay , look , we gotta get off this island and get that tooth out of your arm , all right ? Now stay low , and go . Go ! Have a unit sent to Wards . Tell them to arrest Major Hoffman and Dr. Gordon on sight . Yes , Mr. President . [ sirens blaring ] [ claws clattering ] Oh , my God . [ growling ] General , They 're heading southbound , heading right toward Central Park . We 've contacted the Secretary of Defense . We 've been told to shut down the bridges and quarantine the city . GEN . MONNING : Good work , Simms . What about the tracking system ? We 're loading up their GPS signal . I 'll let you know when it 's up and running . My God . The wolves are gonna tear the city apart trying to find a way out . Our people aren 't gonna let that happen . This is all my fault . If I 'd have just come clean in the beginning , none of this would have happened . It 's okay . Like hell , it is ! People are dying . Get this thing out of my arm . DR. GORDON : I will . Got a secure place in mind ? University . It 'll have everything I need . So how the hell are we gonna get there ? One of those . Isn 't this electric ? MAJ . HOFFMAN : Come on , stand back . Now what ? We zip-line . [ growling ] [ growling slows ] [ snarling ] Okay , well , here goes nothing . Relax , Major . I don 't think I can do this . You 'll be fine as long as you 're not connected to the ground . Oh , boy . [ beeping ] Just do what I do . Are you sure you 're gonna be okay ? I 'll be fine . Great . She photographs killer wolves . She bungee jumps . Anything else you want to tell us about yourself ? [ beeping ] No way . [ screams ] [ gunfire ] Let 's go ! Get to the boat ! Come on . [ gunfire ] Taylor , shut down the fences at the northwest corner , now ! Yes , sir . Cut power to zone two now . Okay ? Yeah . We got company . Marine craft on the starboard side . Shut down your engines immediately , and prepare to be boarded . Move up next to them . Stay down . Hold on tight . Stay in front . Hang on . Turn ! COL . FALCONS : Damn it ! [ siren blaring ] Hold on . Mr. President , Manhattan 's quarantined , but the canines are still spreading across the island . Why is the gas ineffective now when it worked at JFK ? JFK was an enclosed environment , sir . They 're out in the open now . Mr. President , they 're moving into Central Park . We need to give our troops an answer . We have a go . Lethal force has been authorized . Talk to me . COL . FALCONS : We lost her , sir , west of Roosevelt Island . Ah , don 't worry . I 've got her . I 'm on my way . Sir , we just received authorization from the President . It 's about time . Light ' em up . [ sirens blaring ] I got ' em . Headed south through the trees , coming at you . [ Growl / snarling ] Okay , men ! Here we go . Stand by to fire ! [ Growl ] Fire ! [ gunfire echoing ] Wait . F-Fall back . How long before we get to the university ? Oh , about 15 minutes from here . We don 't have that much time . Can I ask you a question ? Why did that wolf bite you ? I saw your pictures of the black wolf , but why did it bite you ? You ever look a predator in the eyes ? As a matter of fact , I have . I guess I wanted to know how close I could get . Well , you got about as close as you can , 'cause now you are one with him , literally . I gotta get us a ride . Get out . Go . We have a visual on the pack , headed south on Fifth just below us . Permission to engage ? Copy that . Permission granted . [ machine gun firing ] [ machine gun firing ] Holy ... They 're on West 37th , headed towards Broadway . Okay , Brian , you better start talking to me . What did you mean when you said that our guys wouldn 't let the wolves pass the city boundaries ? After JFK , the powers that be decided that if the virus ever spread into a populated area , it would be too great a risk , so they put an operation in place to eradicate it . How ? They can 't be serious . Damn . Hold on ! Go ! Go ! Go ! DONNA : How did they find us ? DR. GORDON : The chip ! What chip ? ! The tracking chip in your arm . Every patient got one . Here they come . Come on . Hold on . Hold on . I 'm going to try to lose him . Oh ! Oh , my God . Whoa ! [ horn honks ] [ Gunshot ] No ! [ heartbeat racing ] [ heartbeat slowing ] Let me go ! Get the girl in the jeep and the doctor . No ! Come in , General . Go ahead , Colonel . We got the girl , sir , and the doctor . Hoffman 's dead . Get ' em back to Wards . Yes , sir . Colonel Falcons , make it quick . The city doesn 't have much longer . The canines have made their way south into southern Manhattan . It 's only a matter of time before they make their way off the island . The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 90 million people in just over a year . Now , if we do not contain this lupine virus , it could infect the entire United States within 72 hours , within two weeks , the entire Western Hemisphere . You 're talking about one of the greatest cities in the world , killing almost 2 million people , our citizens , just--just wiping them out . Sir , if we don 't act , this virus could wipe out the entire human race , and without a cure , eradication is your only option . Sir , the operation would be quick and efficient . We take out all bridges and tunnels surrounding the city , effectively sealing it off , then deliver the payload , a series of fuel-air explosives detonated over the island . Sir , if we 're going to act , now 's the time . Heavy is the head that wears the crown . I pray that the souls of these brave Americans be at peace ... and that history bare the necesity of this greatest obligation . Do it . [ distant sirens blaring ] [ helicopters whirring ] [ howling , snarling ] They 're pulling out . Patient Zero , you 've led us on a merry chase . Time to get that tooth . I 'm gonna make it my personal mission to see to it that you are charged with everything you deserve , Monning- - mutiny , torture , murder . History will remember you as nothing more than a common thug with a gun . That 's a sacrifice I 'm willing to make for the country I 've sworn to protect . There won 't be a country to protect ! If the pack breaks the city boundaries , the infection will spread out of control . There will be no stopping it . They won 't get out of the city . I promise you . GEN . MONNING : You 've got 10 minutes , Doctor . [ monitor beeping ] This isn 't gonna hurt you . It 's gonna be okay . I know . I trust you . The antibodies . I have to close . The antibodies , Doctor . You 've got five minutes . [ snarling ] The canines are heading for Brooklyn Bridge . Donna , put pressure on this . Ticktock , Doctor . [ pouring ] [ blood drips ] Whatever happens , I know it 's not your fault . How long for the antibodies to react to the virus ? Recognition varies , depending on the virus . We 've never done anything like this before . [ heart beating faster ] Wait ! [ sighs ] The vial , Doctor . Donna . The vial , Doctor . We have the cure . [ groans ] [ snarling ] Move . Sitrep ? What 's going on out there ? Let 's go . They 're not going anywhere . Lift exploded , sir . Hoffman . [ groaning ] Donna . Donna , can you sit up ? I don 't know how we 're gonna get out of here . [ clattering ] Brian . You okay ? Thank God . I 've got it , Brian . It worked . Great . Yeah . All right , guys . Come on . We gotta get out of here . GEN . MONNING : You 're not leaving the island with that tooth , Hoffman . You got 10 seconds to come out , or we start shooting .

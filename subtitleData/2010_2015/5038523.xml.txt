 Previously on " V " ... What is your purpose for seeing me ? Your loyalty to our species . If Lisa fails me , this Queen egg will save us . You gonna be okay with this assignment ? - I know you two are friends . - That 's why you asked for me , isn 't it ? Their invasion ships aren 't on the way . They 're already here . Having control over humans through bliss ... I can stop any resistance . Blissing one human nearly killed you . Are you sure this is wise ? Why is that traitor here ? We are surrounded by an invasion fleet . We are out of options . - This is my grandmother . - We 're going to overthrow Anna . What the hell are you doing here ? No one understands what it feels like to have the weight of an entire species on your shoulders ... Every decision , every hard choice . No one except you . You understand . To survive , you must show no mercy , be void of any humanity ... Just like me . I am nothing like you . Yes , you are , Erica . You 're exactly like me . - Oh . - What are you doing ? What , another nightmare about the Visitors ? Yeah . And what the future will look like when Anna is gone . Well , let 's take the bitch down and find out . My breeding plans are reaching fruition . Lisa is fertile . And tonight , she and Tyler will mate . We have still not learned how to extract the human soul . When Lisa 's children are born , how will you control them ? Amy . She will provide the secret to blissing humans . Blissing one human nearly killed you . Don 't question me , Marcus . I am your Queen . Mom ! Leave us . Amy . What is it ? What 's wrong ? I had a dream last night . Something terrible happened to you . Please don 't ever leave me , Mother . I promise . I 'll never abandon you like your father did . Diana called ? Yeah . She said it was an emergency . She wouldn 't give me any more information - till we were all together . - Okay . Diana , we 're all here . I have received news from Marcus that my daughter 's plans have moved along faster than we initially believed . We cannot wait a moment longer to remove her from power . But we just started planning . We 're not ready yet . - We need more time . - Unfortunately , time is not a luxury that we can afford , Chad . We need Lisa . Where is she ? - She 's on her way now . - We must act immediately . It 's your call . You 're the leader . What do you think ? No . This involves all of us . It is all of our calls . We 've come too far to turn back now . All my life , I turned to the sky to see God . Now I look at the sky , I see 29 ships . Beyond them , hundreds more . I want to look to the sky and see God again . I 'm with you . You know that ship better than anyone . You wanna redeem yourself ? Get up there . Break Diana out of her cell . We 're gonna need all the help we can get . We 're on . You do your part , Erica . I 'll do mine . Okay . Zinc-lined , like Diana requested . Even our trackers can 't trace a scent through this . An immolation gun , like you requested . Did you get Tyler off the ship ? He 's okay . Now I wanna know the plan , and why you wouldn 't tell me until now . I didn 't want you to have too long to think about it . In order for our plan to work , we need a way to get your mother away from her security . That 's where you come in . We 're gonna fake a kidnapping . Once my mother discovers I 'm missing , she 'll stop at nothing to find me . When the time is right , we want her to find you . Why ? We need to eliminate her . Ever since the failed assassination attempt , her security won 't let anyone get close enough to kill her . Except the one person she would expect least . You . In breaking news , WNT has just learned that Visitor High Commander Anna 's daughter Lisa has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom by the terrorist group , the Fifth Column . Their demands are unprecedented . We 've just received this video . High Commander Anna , the Fifth Column has your daughter . Our demands are simple ... Your life in exchange for hers . It 's you we want dead , Anna . Trade yourself , or we will kill your daughter . How did this happen ? She was seeing to some peace ambassador duties at the center . Find Lisa . Send out our best tracker . Ready my shuttle immediately . My Queen , you must not go down to earth . You cannot risk your life . Lisa is the future Queen , the key to our breeding plan , and the perpetuity of our species . Marcus is right . The Fifth Column has forced my hand . You are willing to give up your life for Lisa 's ? No . And I won 't have to , because you 'll make sure that tracker finds her before it comes to that . Anna , I am so sorry about this . There is nothing worse than when your child is in danger . I promise you we will get Lisa back safely . Thank you . Does the FBI have any leads my daughter 's whereabouts ? Fifth Column 's instructed us to bring you to Jack Landry . If you agree to meet with him , he 'll give you the location where you 're expected to trade yourself for your daughter . Something , of course , we can never allow to happen . No . We want to use a body double . That 'll keep you safe . The Fifth Column said they would kill Lisa if I didn 't meet their exact demands . If they were to suspect it wasn 't me , - wouldn 't I be putting her at risk ? - There is not a mother on earth who wouldn 't sacrifice her life for the life of her child 's . I wouldn 't trade Tyler 's safety for anything . But our priority is to keep you safe . And we can 't let you go in there . I 'll give you a minute . Tell the FBI I will meet with Jack Landry . Anna 's off the ship . She took the bait and went after Lisa . How 's my daughter doing ? She 's safe . As soon as this is over , the two of you will be reunited . It 's good to be back on the same side with you . Diana 's cell is this way . We have to hurry . Jack Landry ? I 'm Anna . I know who you are . As I know who you are . You 've been very outspoken against my people since our arrival . It 's preaching like yours that has led to this . I would never intend for an innocent girl like Lisa to get hurt , but I stand by every word I 've spoken against you . Even though it 's cost you your collar ? Everything you believed in . The church took away my collar , not God . So God is telling you to do the Fifth Column 's bidding ? Answer me . I answer only to Him , not you . And with his help , you daughter 's life can be saved . So what are the instructions ? I was told you are to turn yourself over in one hour at the location written inside this envelope . Leave your security behind and go alone . Once you arrive ... The Fifth Column will contact me and inform me where they 're holding Lisa . Thanks for your help . And this God you have so much faith in ... I hope someday to meet Him . They may have covered up Lisa 's scent , but not the human scent on this envelope . It will lead us to her . Whoever 's behind this will pay . My Queen . The tracker traced the human scent from the envelope . We have located Lisa . She 's alone . Her captors must 've fled before we got there . Shall we bring her back to the ship ? No . Leave her there for now . As you all know , a terrible thing has happened to my daughter . I have been asked to give my life for hers . I stand here today not as the leader of my people but as a mother . If Visitors value anything , it is life , above all else . I cannot let any harm befall my daughter . No matter what happens , my only wish is that you welcome her into your hearts as you welcomed me . Leak the location where the FBI is holding Lisa . Make sure Chad Decker 's there . I want the whole world to see what happens . Yes , my Queen . Your mother will be here shortly . Now the moment you get the chance , you take the shot . No hesitation , okay ? Now once it 's done , we 'll let Ryan know that it 's safe for Diana to reach out to her followers . Okay ? Lisa ... You can do this . We are now live outside the warehouse where , apparently , Visitor High Commander Anna 's daughter Lisa is being held by Fifth Column terrorists for ransom . What do we know ? Another anonymous tip claiming Lisa 's inside . Anna won 't use a body double and she won 't let S.W.A.T. go in . She 's afraid if she doesn 't adhere exactly - to Fifth Column demands , they 'll kill Lisa . - Great . That ties our hands here . Yeah . Yeah , pretty much . Are you sure you wanna do this ? Yes . Thank you . Lisa is the only one inside . You 're safe to go in . In a shocking and unprecedented moment , Visitor High Commander Anna is about to enter this warehouse to willingly give her own life in order to rescue her daughter . Lisa ! - Are you injured ? - I 'm fine . Who did this to you ? I don 't know . They had masks . I thought they were gonna kill me . Then they heard the tracker and ran off . Nobody does this to me . I 'm gonna find out who 's responsible , and they will be punished . Lisa , I cannot tell you how worried I was about you . This human skin ... I never realized how much it affected me . Or maybe ... I didn 't want to admit the grasp emotion had on me until ... Until what , Mother ? Until I thought I might lose you . I feel , now that you 're safe ... This emotion . I know now ... It cannot be bad . Lisa , I was wrong about so much . If humans could teach me this ... this feeling I have for you ... My daughter , then everything must change . Humans and Visitors living side by side ... In peace . I know I 've never told you this before , but I want you to know ... I love you . There , there . It 's okay . It 's gonna be okay . My God . She didn 't do it . It is a miraculous moment here with Lisa back safe in her mother Anna 's arms . From where I 'm standing , it doesn 't appear as though the Visitor High Commander has been harmed in any way . - Erica . We have Diana . - Get off the ship . Lisa didn 't go through with it . Anna is alive . She 's heading back to the ship now . Go . Lisa didn 't kill Anna . They 're headed back here now . We have to abandon the mission , get you back to your cell . No . I 'm not going back down there . We have no choice . Anna will kill you if she finds you out of your cell . I am the rightful Queen , and I will not allow my daughter to destroy our species . Gather my people . Lisa appears to have some minor contusions but does not seem to be in any pain . Quite the contrary , she seems relieved , glad to be back in her mother 's safekeeping . Thank you , agent Evans , for everything you 've done . All that matters is that you have your daughter back . We 're gonna see if we can get a word - from the High Commander now . Anna ! - Are you hurt ? I 'm sorry . I couldn 't do it . All of that preparation ... Humanity in the balance , and that is your answer ? You don 't understand . I think my mother 's changed . She wants us to live together in peace . No . She 's lying to you , Lisa . I saw it in her eyes . We can trust her . What if you 're wrong ? She is merciless . Mo more merciless than you 've shown you can be . Hello , my children . It is your mother ... Diana . For fifteen years , I have dreamed of being reconnected with my children again . You have been lied to ... Misled . My daughter had me imprisoned because she thought she had a better plan for our species . She has proven ill-equipped to be your Queen . The human soul is a gift . We must embrace the soul , embrace humanity . Together , humans and Visitors can live side by side in peace . Your rightful Queen has returned to lead you on a new beginning . From this moment on ... Did you think you could outmaneuver me ? Daughter ... You taught me everything you know , but you never learned half of what I know . You 've just ... doomed us all . Now that 's how you kill your mother . I imprisoned this woman , my mother , to protect you . She was weak ... Stained with human emotion . She wanted to dilute our species ... Subvert us to the humans . No matter what the obstacles , I will never allow that to happen . I am your Queen . And I will protect you . But if anyone defies my will ... They will meet the same fate as my mother . Take her away . - I 'll deal with her later . - Mother ... please . Now kneel . Ryan ... You have to get off the ship while you still can . I 've run before , but not this time . I am not leaving the ship without my daughter . Amy ? What are you doing in my room ? Listen ... We have to get out of here right now , okay ? Before Anna finds out that I 'm here . All right ? Get out . Okay , Amy ... Amy ... I 'm your father . I 'm not gonna fight you . A father who abandoned me , left me to suffer in pain ? No , that 's not true . That 's not true at all . Listen ... Anna 's just been twisting things . Sweetheart , everything that I 've ever done was only to protect you after your mother had died . No . Anna is my mother . And you ... you left me here to die . I will never let you hurt me or Anna ever again . Pick up . Pick up . Pick up . Ty ? ! Pick up , pick up . Come on , Ty . Pick up . Hey , Mom . - Ty , where are you ? - I 'm on the ship . I just got back from a , uh , shuttle flight . - I need you to get off the ship now . - Mom , what are you talking about ? I have kept things from you about the Visitors , but it is time that you knew the truth about everything . They were right . We 've got a problem . Erica knows everything . Tyler , get off the ship . Now . Mom , if what you 're saying is true , then ... - I have to hear it from Lisa myself . - No . I love you . Tyler ! Ty ! Worldwide leaders are flocking to support the Visitor High Commander Anna in the wake of today 's kidnapping of her daughter Lisa . Anna 's selfless decision to risk her own life in order to save her daughter 's is being met with universal praise . I have won the love and respect of humanity the world over . It 's time to see our breeding plan to completion . But Lisa has betrayed you . She cannot be trusted to mate with Tyler . Lisa will not be birthing the next generation of our species . Fully preserved Queen egg . When is she due to hatch ? Put skin on my new daughter . Make sure she looks exactly like Lisa . We got here , and Hobbes was gone . Everything was cleared out . Why would he just disappear ? I 've been trying to call him . He 's not answering his cell . Keep trying . I told Tyler everything . Everything ... About the Visitors . He 's still on the ship ... And it 's my fault . Okay , wait , Erica . Just try not to panic , okay ? We 've all misstepped . No . Not you . You are the only one ... who held strong to what you believe in . It 's not too late for you . I 've let my anger blind me . I became someone just like her . Never again . No word from Ryan either . What the hell is going on on that ship ? Your life in exchange for hers . My Queen ... There is something I must confess . I watched you fall prey to human emotion ... and fell victim to Diana 's manipulations . I betrayed you . And for that , I deserve one fate . Death . No . You acted on what you believed was the best for our species . But I 've learned something new , Marcus . Human emotion can be useful . It 's how I stopped Lisa from killing me . If I can wield it like a weapon , use it to manipulate the humans , I 'll be more powerful than ever before . My only regret is I cannot give you the names of my co-conspirators . I interfaced only with Diana . She made sure of that . There may be a way . Our techs have been working on this message since it aired . The way the voice was disguised , it 's not possible to unscramble it ... With human technology . It 's you we want dead , Anna . Trade yourself , or we will kill your daughter . That 's Chad Decker 's voice . Bring him to me . And , Marcus ... Don 't ever betray me again . Is she ready ? Yes . Let me see her . Hello , Mother . Has she watched all of Lisa 's memories ? Just what she needs for tonight . Tyler will not know the difference . Go to him , my daughter . Yes , Mother . She 's perfect . Lisa . I missed you . We need to talk . What 's wrong ? I know this sounds insane , but ... I heard from someone that you guys don 't really look like us underneath , and ... and ... and that you 're actually here to hurt humans , not ... not to help us . I know it sounds crazy . It 's ... It is crazy , Tyler . You 've certainly looked better , dear . Unfortunately , there 's just some people you can 't trust . Welcome to your new home . Thankfully , your grandmother won 't be needing it any longer . Why don 't you just kill me ? I wasn 't lying when I said not all human emotion is bad . This one 's called vengeance . I wanna see you suffer . Enjoy the show . Tyler , I 'm really worried . Please call me after you talk to Lisa . No ! Please ! No ! Now just untie one hand , and it 'll be a fair fight . You 're here because of what you know . You had to poke your head around . You wanted to know everything about the Visitors . Well , now ... you 're gonna have to deal with the consequences . Who are you ? I 'm Lars Tremont , leader of Project Ares . Chad Decker ? Yes ? Anna would like to see you . Now . Where are we ? About a mile beneath Manhattan . This place could withstand any nuclear fallout , or , say , the impact of a mother ship being blown out of the sky . Project Ares is a cabal of high-ranking military and government leaders from around the world who 've long suspected that the V 's are not of peace . We also know , as do you , that they 've been here a lot longer than anyone has imagined . Gentlemen ? Paul ? Evans . Chris ? How long have you been tracking me ? Long enough to know that we can trust you . This , agent Evans , is humanity 's last best hope ... for a future . Attempting to bliss humanity will surely kill you . Then I will die , but not before I fulfill my promise to my subjects and show them that humanity cannot nor will not ever defeat us . You feel only peace . Sense only peace . Only my bliss can comfort you . Please , my Queen , please stop . This will kill you . Only my bliss can save you . Feel ... My bliss . Mother , stop . I can do it for you . You sense only peace . What 's going on ? - Something 's happening to people . - Where ? Everywhere . You feel only comfort . Only calm . Only love . I am your sole protector and your keeper . Only my bliss . I am all you need . You really are a miracle , my child . Hey . Wake up . Wake up ! Did I do good , Mother ? Yes . Yes , you did .

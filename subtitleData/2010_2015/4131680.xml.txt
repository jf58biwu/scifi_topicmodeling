Jock and a half rock loser , but yes ! Let 's go show Jenny your bags . Jenny , how do I put this delicately ? Sometimes , daddies leave home because they just don 't want to be daddies anymore . Okay , it 's not about you . It 's about not wanting to b e with you . But , he didn 't lea ve me , Mr. Murphy , he disappeared . And I think it has something to do with this . Where did you get this picture ? It was hidden in my dad 's office . He was researching the origins of this book .

Where 'd you get that cool guitar ? Ow ! My guitar 's a little sensitive about other people touching it . Are you sensitive to touch ? Uh ... Why don 't you and I go someplace private ? I 'd love to see these magical fingers of yours at work . She doesn 't want your paws on her fun bags . She wants her hands on the book ! Who knows ? Maybe you could teach me a few things . She 's onto us . Eliminate her . Do her , then eliminate her . No ! Eliminate her , then do her ? What 's going on , Todd ? Look , I gotta get ready to go on stage . I know you have the book , Todd !

You do something ! Ahhhhhhhhhh ! Don 't do it , Curtis ! It 's the only clue I have to find my dad . Don 't do it , Curtis ! Join me and you will have everything you ever dreamed of . I 'm sorry , Todd , this bad beast has got to burn . No ! Todd ! Shoot ! Todd , are you okay ? Don 't worry about me . Are you okay ? Eew , what the heck is goin ' on in here ? Uh ... The battle of the bands kind of got out of control . You kids sure know how to party , man ... I haven 't seen this much blood since that kid bled out his hatch this morning . Dude , that was so awesome . Except for almost killing everyone . Yeah , I 'm just glad it 's over . What do you mean over ? That thing 's still out there and we 've got to find it before it hurts anybody else . Uh , not my problem . Let somebody else deal with it . Let 's go get baked ... awesome . After everything that 's happened , how can you not feel responsible ? God , you guys are such idiots . Dude , this is your chance to finally get close to Jenny . Hey , Jenny , wait ! Now , I 've given it a lot of thought and I think that the best way to find the book is to work together . Close . R eal close . I 'm already regretting this . So , are we getting paid for this ? No , we 're not getting paid . I really think we should be drawing some kind of salary . Well , it 's not going to happen , okay ? We should , like , go back to your house tonight and talk about how we 're going to find the book . Um , that 's not going to happen either . Yeah , it 's a bit late . Let 's do it tomorrow night . I can totally do it tomorrow night . Uh , I don 't remember you being invited , dude . Uh , I don 't remember you being invited , dude . I can 't believe the book actually exists . It was totally like , ' pow ' ! And then I was like , ' whoa ' ! And then the book totally flew away . The prophecy ! We must prepare for the final countdown . I 'll sharpen the knives and get a goat . Silence ! It is a glorious day . At long last we have found the book . And soon it will be ours again . The prophecy will be fulfilled and we will reap the rewards . Um , yeah - about that prophecy ... the book flew away . In flames . All gone , bye-bye . Oh , atticus , it takes more than fire to destroy the book . It survives . Perhaps weakened , but searching for another soul from which to draw power . It will make itself known to whomever needs it the most . The insecure . The desperate . The feeble . They will find comfort in the bosom of the book . Then there will be chaos . And that 's ... a good thing ?

 British rule was getting all over in India . And British Map makers were busy making a map of India . I have printed all the villages on the map , only this small village is left . Sir ! The biggest mental hospital is in that village . Don 't you get scared ? Mentals would be in the mental hospital . They won 't stand on the streets for our welcome . What happens ? - What happens ? - They escaped . They escaped from the mental hospital . Who escaped ? Who has escaped from the mental hospital ? Mental people escaped from there . They have occupied the entire village . Save your lives . - Now what do we do ? - We will have to go there . That 's the only village left . And I have to submit this report tomorrow morning . It 's just a small village . Who cares if you put on the map ? If we go to that village then ... And that 's how that small village lost its place from Indian map . What happens ? Either my faith is wrong that there are people living outside of this world , or I am not good for that . So I could make a machine which can communicate with those people . You are making the world 's first machine who could contact Aliens , and that hard job will take time . But those people who gave me money to make this machine , they want results . I told them back then that I will give them results in two years , and you know that today , two years have been completed . And tomorrow , I have a meeting with them . So what will you tell them ? Where you have been ? I have been trying to phone you the whole morning . It 's nothing ! My phone was switched off . Please don 't ask me anything . I have only bad news . I also have some bad news for you . There was a phone call for you , from India . The caller said that he is your brother . Your dad is in serious condition , and he is on last stage . He wants to meet you . I will have to go India . We will have to go India ... - We ? - Yes we ... And we are going tonight . I have confirmed the tickets . You can 't go to India ! What will you do there ? I am not asking you . I am telling you . I am coming to India with you . We have been living together for the last 4 years . And you never told me that you have a family in India . You always told me that you have nobody ... I am sorry ! Why did you hide this thing from me ? Why didn 't you tell me about your dad and brother ? You are coming to India ... so see it by yourself ! What 's your village name ? Pagla Pur ... How many stations to Pagla Pur ? This train doesn 't go to Pagla Pur ! It just goes to Ratna Pur , then we will have to take a bus . Two tickets for Pagla Pur . Two tickets for Palan Pur . But Ma 'am wants to go to Pagla Pur . - We have to go to Pagla Pur . - This bus doesn 't go to Pagla Pur ... We will go to Palan Pur then we will take an auto ... First please tell me where you wanna go ? Pagla Pur ! Take some extra money . Take us there ! If you say Afghanistan then I will take you there ... but I will never go to that strange village . You are frightened that villagers will attack your auto . Mentals are coming ! Where are you going ? I will never go to Pagla Pur ... You didn 't get hurt . Now we are addicted to that ... We are unfortunate people ... Come here ! This is Babban . My brother . Babban ! This is Deewa , my friend ... Hi ! Don 't be scared , you have to see the entire village . Who will study well ... will become viceroy . Hide yourself ! He came here everyday . Gone ! - What ? - We are saved . But teacher , why did the Germans attack us this time ? I don 't know . When this world war will be over . You became a scientist to study in this school . Yes ! I was in this school till third standard . You came ! I 've just arrived , I have to go to meet my dad . Your dad 's condition is serious . And he will live only a few more days . What 's that ? It 's Raja 's house ... Raja will be happy to see him . His Grandpa was in the mental hospital . He was the king of some state . He still thinks he is a King . My last weapon you have come She is my friend She is my friend I was going to meet dad . So I thought I should meet you . I feel like I would sing a song but ... Your dad 's condition is very serious and he is very sick , and he will only live a few more days . - Today is some kind of celebration . - No ! today is Independence Day ! Independence Day ! But today is not 15 August ? Today is the Independence Day for Pagla Pur . This village 's got freedom this day . Who is that ? But he doesn 't looks like Gandhi . He was the first to attack the wardens at the mental hospital . He was also in the mental hospital . And this is his grand-son . Look ! who is here ? I have to meet my dad . What is that kid doing over there ? This is Goti ! He thinks he is a lamp , that 's why he 's hung up . So why don 't you take him down , and we will leave Mukhya at dark . - You came ? - Yes ! - How are you ? - I am fine . How are you ? My condition is serious . I am very sick . And I will live only a few more days . What happens to you ? I am telling you that I am not feeling well . I mean what happened to you . Do you have headaches ? You are puking ... How do I know ? I am not a doctor . - Can you walk ? - He can 't even walk . In fact he can 't get up ... But now you have come so my life will get extra time . Now I will hand over this village in your hands and I can rest in peace ... - No ! don 't talk like that . - I won 't say it . Now that I have come , everything will be fine . Sattu Bro said ... Everything will be fine . I will take you to the biggest hospital in the city . No ! No ! - What do you mean no ? - How can he get better ? Which doctor will come to this village ? No ! He means to say not right now . It 's sunset ! We will all go tomorrow morning I was also saying that ... How did you get out from this place and reach America ? I knew from childhood that there must be a place outside this village . Some other world ... I worked really hard to get out from this place . I was walking 12 km everyday to that village for my studies . Then I reached Delhi . I worked hard over there . I 've got a scholarship . I have paid my fees , and then straight to America ... and now back from America . Your eyes are Aliens ... They really love you . How could you live away from them ? But I can 't do the things here that I want to do ... And I will sit here and do my job . - Let 's go ! - Where ? Villagers are celebrating for your coming back ... Dad is not feeling well , so how could we celebrate ? Mukhya ! you are going fine ... Shut up ! You couldn 't get up ... You made a plan to call me here . No drama ! I sung a song . Fine ! You guys sing the song all night long . Which song should we sing ? I have saved this madness from you . We can go tomorrow morning . Why do we need to go late at night ? I just wanted you to come back for you to save this village Do you have any idea how much I worked hard to save this village ? I had only one month to save my 2 years hard work ... and now less than a month because of you . But how do we know ? Don 't leave us ... Nobody will follow me . Nobody will speak after me . What happened to you ? Let 's go ! You have said that nobody will follow you . You 've gone mad living with these people . You are not insane . - Why are we going in this jungle ? - It 's very safe . I used to go this way ... There was a shortcut here ... By using our brains . Think ! What 's so special in this village who could take people 's attention ? Think ! What 's that thing ? I know it ... What 's here ? When I was young , my dad said that there was oil under this land . Oil ! Isn 't it the big thing ? What 's the big deal ? Oil is in my head as well ... So fry some snacks in that oil . Do you know that if we have oil in here , then many multinationals will come here ? We will be rich ! My Grandpa used to dig holes to find that oil Did he find any oil ? No ! So what are you going to see there ? We are going to seek the holes there . Get back ! We didn 't come here for a picnic . Holes ! Then lay down in those holes ... We will make your grave . Nothing else here ! Except holes , leaves and trees ... This is a magical place here . What magical place ? Where is the magic here ? That idiot told us to look over here and he has gone to another place . How did he come there ? I knew that ... You have some hidden art . It 's not a hidden art , but it 's a hidden way . Where does this way end ? On the side of the well . But that won 't help us . We will show the magical appearance to people . People won 't leave their work to come and see your magic show . We will have to think of something else . Now show your magic . Yes ! It 's God for me . Do you believe in God ? It 's God for me . Now I can 't spend more time on it . Keep it on some safe place . Nobody should touch it ... We need more rope . How much ? Bring as much as you can . He is not preparing for our suicide . What are you doing ? Cut it in smaller pieces , and Raja , you also help them . Do one thing ! Put some wet sand on it . But that will make rusty pieces ... - That 's all we want . - Is it fine ? Harder ! - Sattu ! - Yes ! What will it do ? So that we can stay on equal distance . It will take eight hours ... When will we start ? Tonight at 9 . We have made this wrestling ring . We didn 't make this wrestling ring . We have been working eight hours . If we didn 't make it , so who would have made it ? Listen to me ! After today ! If anybody comes to Pagla Pur and ask , we haven 't done anything . If they ask who did it , then you will say ... we don 't know ... But we didn 't do it . Every year , we cut the harvest and nobody comes to see ... and you 've just ruined the harvest this year . Now who will come to see this ? You just have to look ... People will come to see this . What are we waiting for ? Where is Sattu ? He told us to watch ahead , and he didn 't escape from the side . What 's all this ? You are making fun of our poverty ? Don 't make fun of us . And listen to me . We will all wear these clothes , so we could look like you . And nobody should have doubts on us . Any questions ? One car is heading this way , and there is an umbrella on its roof . It 's the curse of Lord Shiv . It 's the third eye of Lord Shiv which has opened ... to destroy this world ... So what do we do now ? What he is saying ? His name is Simon . Why are you making this sound on everything ? I am saying that he knows Agastya . It 's a good thing that he knows him . He might be a friend , and he will help us . He is not a friend , you can call him an enemy . And he can ruin our plan to show his enmity . How is that ? Let 's go ! Let 's kidnap him . Everyone sit down ! Raja ! You also sit down ! The entire world is here . If they discover that he has disappeared , then it will be a mess . We will kidnap him , and we will replace him with Lord Pokland . - Who will discover that ? - Don 't talk rubbish ! And listen to me ! Tomorrow Simon will try to talk to you . He will try to ask various questions , but you won 't answer him . Remember ! You will not answer to any question . Only you will talk to him ! Only you will talk to him , and nobody else will . Only he will talk . We don 't have any milk here . Where have they gone ? Come inside ! We have more space in here . You will keep hiding in here . I have told you to keep an eye on him . I am watching him ! Now everybody will leave tomorrow . What did you think next ? I will think if you let me think . Why are you screaming ? I am not screaming , Deewa is screaming . What happens ? What was that ? It must be your dad , and he would have gone there . Water was not in a mug ! Everybody , surround this place ! You haven 't found any other place . Who is there ? He is that Alien ! He is our Kachwa ! His name is Kachwa , but he runs like a rat . Get lost from here . She apologizes to you She is saying that ... What happens ? I am saying that nobody will go back to Pagla Pur . How do I look like ? Have you got any exclusive footage ? I haven 't found anything . But I am trying my best . I 've never seen an idiot like you . All channels are getting some exclusive footage . Bobby ! Get the camera ! Come fast ! Where has he gone ? What 's happening ? Are you ready ? Go ! Don 't be afraid ! Bobby ! It 's an Alien ! Shoot him ! What are you doing ? Don 't stand still , do something . Entertain the people ! Great job ! If we leave him ... then he will ruin our plan . Until we finish our plan , let him stay here . To get to Pagla Pur ... three states have started progress work . The FBI has come to Pagla Pur to find Simon . Our mission is complete . Now it 's time to finish the game . Tonight the Aliens will release Simon . And they will go back to their home . But if Simon tells our secret to anyone , we will release him in such a condition , that if he tells anything to anyone , nobody will believe him . Simon ! Go back ! Seeing Simon , looks like Aliens have raped and released him . Now shall I come and drop you in America ? Why did he stop ? Now what will be the next move ? UFO ! I think they are gone with the UFO . Leave him ! Aliens are going back home . Run ! It 's a balloon . I can 't see anything . Why you are jumping on me ? I am protecting you . He didn 't go yet ! It looks like a girl . Speak louder ! What is he saying ? If I had understood so , I wouldn 't talk to him . Tell me what he is saying . They had our message two years earlier . Since then , they have been watching us ... That means my machine has been working on and on ... My machine is working . What else he is saying ? Before contacting us , these people ... wanted to satisfy themselves that we were good people . And now , they believe that ... we are nice people . Now they are satisfied that we are nice people . They are satisfied . Who will make us believe that they have been watching us for 2 years ? They are saying that they have brought a gift for us . When they leave this place , we will get our gift . Why are they in a hurry ? Have some refreshments ! No gift here ! Look ! There is nothing here . What happens ? Look , what happened ? What happened ? Look at this ! What 's happening ? It 's oil ! We have oil in our Pagla Pur ... I already told you there was oil here . Joker wasn 't part of any color and he won 't be anymore . Pagla Pur doesn 't need anyone ... Corrections by jcdr v1.0 - 07.09.2012

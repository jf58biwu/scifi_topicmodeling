 ( Walter ) A person 's soul continues to live on after death . ( Announcer ) Previously on Fringe ... And all we have to do is summon the soul to the host and he 'll be back here with us . ( Nina ) Soul magnets . William is gone . You can 't bring him back . The soul magnets ... drew your consciousness into Olivia . I assure you she is totally safe . Olivia 's brain can ... accommodate my consciousness for ... several weeks . ( Peter ) Weeks ? - Not a chance . - ( Broyles ) 48 hours . Then I want you out of my agent or I 'll have Dr. Bishop figure out how to drive you out . [ Humming ] The little old lady from Ipanina . [ Chuckles ] It 's the girl from Ipanema . And no . Try again . ( Olivia as Bell ) Oh , Walter , can we try something else ? - And no showtunes . - ( Walter ) You 're taking the fun out of it . What 's the temperature , son ? We 're at 64 degrees . Perfect ! Astro , are we ready ? Just about , Wally . - And you 're sure this is safe , Walter . - Perfectly . If everything goes according to plan , the electrical current will latch onto the dominant consciousness , which is Belly 's , and coax it into its new residence . I meant safe for Olivia . Oh . Of course . - No offense . - Oh . None taken . ( Walter ) Olivia 's mind is still peacefully at rest . She won 't be aware of any of this . Though we should all take a few steps back . Excuse me ? It 's perfectly safe , son . I assure you . EEGs are online . - You ready , Belly ? - Aye , aye , Captain . - Do it , dear . - Okay . Three , two , one ... [ Loud pop ] ( Olivia as Bell ) Walter ? Didn 't work . [ Sighs ] Damn ! You can reset the circuit breakers , dear . Tell the medical school we 're returning Mr. Spencer . Sorry . So what now ? Well , now I guess we try and find another brain-dead host . And what makes you think it 's gonna go any better this time ? That body fit all of your parameters , and we were lucky to find him in the first place . Perhaps we should think up another idea . ( Peter ) I have a new idea . You said that if you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours that you would just go away . Are you suggesting that I die ? I 'm suggesting that I want Olivia back . [ Pop ] And I 'm losing patience . Peter ... Oh , Peter , help me ! Astrid ! What happened ? ( Peter ) Call 911 ! Female . 31 years old . Tonic-clonic seizures . No response to 4 milligrams lorazepam IV . BP 's 190 over 110 . Trauma bay two ! Pupils dilated . - How long has she been seizing ? - Going on twenty minutes . ( Peter ) Twenty-five . Okay . Start her on a phenytoin drip . - No , that 's absolutely wrong ! - Excuse me ? Gentlemen , you need to step outside unless you 're family . - He 's my partner . - She 's my girlfriend . - ( Peter ) Walter ... - William cannot tolerate phenytoin ... He 's anemic ! ( Doctor ) She 's crashing . Let 's defib at 360 . - Too much ! It 's too much . - Walter , just let them do their job . What if his consciousness Uh ... Uh ... Uh ... Changed her physiology ? A charge that size directly into her heart ... Walter , they have to do something . ( Nurse ) 354 . Charge to 360 . Doctor ... I 've been jolted once today . If you do it again ... you will kill me and the young woman I 'm living inside of . ( Broyles ) How could this have happened ? Dr. Bell , you assured me that Agent Dunham was perfectly safe . And I believed that she was . With the rats , it was nearly two weeks before I began to see any complications . What rats ? My test subjects . When I was first conducting soul magnet experiments thirty years ago . The rats lasted nearly two weeks before the host 's consciousness got lost . I never anticipated that it would happen more quickly in a human . Wait . Go back . What do you mean , with the rats the host consciousness got lost ? It seems that at a certain point the brain can no longer accommodate two people 's consciousness . So one just went away . And no matter how hard I tried , I was unable to retrieve it . You gave me your word . 48 hours . You said if you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours ... I know what you 're going to suggest , young man . Peter has already said as much . But as much as I may want to ... I can no longer simply leave . ( Peter ) And why not ? ( Walter ) Because at this point , your consciousness is the only thing keeping Olivia 's body alive . - That 's right . - Walter ... How long before Olivia 's gone for good ? Well ... I don 't know exactly , but based on what we 've seen thus far , I would say ... no more than ... a day . Well , if we 're going to get Olivia back , we 're not going to do it here . Okay ... What about this ? What if we try to activate her chi ? Acupuncture ? Yes . We try and stimulate her seventh chakra . Pure consciousness . As much as I love the notion , it could take dozens of sessions spread over several days . You said we had to find a way to pull Olivia out in 24 hours . What if we don 't ? Have to find a way to pull her out , I mean . What are you thinking ? What if , instead of trying to find a way to pull Olivia out , we try and find a way to go in ? - Peter ... - I 'm just saying consider it . We know he has a healthy ego . You don 't start a company like Massive Dynamic without an ego . But do you really think that he would let Olivia die just so ... He could go on living ? I don 't know . Maybe , maybe not . But on the list of accomplishments for William Bell , cheating death would certainly rank number one . - Hmm . - Kids . We think that we have found a way to bring Olivia 's mind back . And to remove William 's . Whole brain emulation . It 's another one of Belly 's old projects . It describes how an inorganic host can house organic material . We 're gonna put Belly in a computer . Much to do and not much time . While we go into Olivia 's mind , you can get to work on this . It 's very self-explanatory . Wait , enter Olivia 's mind how ? We 've done it before ... When Olivia and Agent Scott shared the dream state . It 's a simple variation . Walter . As you know , every brain generates a quantifiable electric field . If we can ... tune ours precisely to Olivia 's , then we can share her mind . We can go looking for her . - Walter ? - Hmm ? Where do you keep the neurosensors ? Back shelf by the fish food . If I remember correctly , you had to put an electromagnetic probe into her brain and dose her with a massive amount of hallucinogenics . Of course ! LSD ! That could solve the superego problem . Ohh ... Oh , that is brilliant , son ! This may be a weird time to ask , but have you ever tripped ? - Are you suggesting that ... - Of course ! It 's Olivia 's mind we 're entering . Presumably , it will be some maze-like iteration of her psyche . Memories are subconscious . You know her better than anyone . If she is lost in her mind , we need you to guide us . Astrid ! We need to mix up 2,000 milligrams of LSD and ... And we need some sugar cubes . Please . ( Walter ) You first , son . Don 't be nervous . I imagine there are things in this very lab that are as mind-blowing as anything that I 've experienced while tripping . Besides ... This is merely a conduit to Olivia 's mind . And when we get there , we should all be very cogent . Typically , you 'd feel the effects of the drug in thirty to forty-five minutes ... [ Quietly ] But I 've added an accelerant . You can start to prepare the sedative , dear . I 'll go and help Belly . Peter , don 't worry . I 'll keep my eye on the monitors . I 'll make sure you 're okay . It 's not me I 'm worried about . I 'm pretty sure there 's a good reason why we can 't enter each other 's minds . What if we kick something loose in there ? Right now , I think you 're her only hope . - How 's it coming ? - So far so good . What ? You 're bald . [ Whispers ] I think he 's an observer . It 's okay , Peter . Walter , we 're ready . Oh . Good . Bring him over . It 's okay . - Drugs ? - Yep . Lots of ' em . Whew . Ooh ... [ Chuckles ] That tickles . [ Loud horn honk ] ( Walter ) Peter ! Peter ! Over here ! I think you better help me down . Whoa ... Whoa ! No ! No ! No ! Of all the places to grab a man , you choose the crotch of my pants ! Hey , I broke your fall , didn 't I ? You spared me no embarrassment in the process . I thought you said none of this was real anyway . I said that everything is a product of Olivia 's subconscious . My feelings are most definitely real . - Where 's Belly ? - I have no idea . He must have entered somewhere else . It doesn 't matter . We 're here for Olivia anyway . So what 's the next step in the plan ? There is one , right , Walter ? Please tell me that the plan doesn 't end here . Of course not ! The plan ... is to find Olivia and guide her out . We just have to start looking . Wal ... Walter ! Amazing , isn 't it ? How are we supposed to pick Olivia out ? All these people are dressed like they raided her closet . More likely , she equipped them according to her preferences . Our fault , I fear . Cortexiphan subjects experience a strong desire to blend in , to stay in the background . They were designed that way . Designed that way ? Peter . What is that ? I believe it 's morse code . And unless I 'm mistaken , that 's an S.O.S. [ Rustling ] What are you doing ? Chocolate pudding . My favorite . Ah , come on , Walter , you can 't seriously be thinking about eating right now . Of course not . I just had lunch . What are you saying ? I 'm asking who it is . It 's Olivia ! She 's found us . Tell her to stay there . We 're on our way . Any changes ? No . They all seem oddly peaceful . Do you really think it 's possible to upload a person 's consciousness to a computer ? [ Chuckles ] I don 't know . I 'm just following Bell 's instructions . The aim is for the computer to mimic the behavior of neurons . I never understood why Walter was so drawn to licorice . But look at it . The swirl ... It 's Bernini 's spiral altar at St. Peter 's . It ... doesn 't end . Did you clean that up ? Yeah . I thought I 'd help you clear the table . You touched the tray with the sugar cubes ? Sure . Why ? Have you ever taken LSD ? The towers are out of proportion . We should be closer by now . It 's Olivia 's mind assigning importance . Our surroundings represent her emotional landscape , don 't forget . Oh . Oh , my . Olivia 's stepfather . What ? Where ? Over there ! That 's ... That 's him ! Olivia 's stepfather . ( Peter ) Hmm . Walter , I 'm ... getting a bad feeling about this . Any suggestions ? Yes . Run ! Oh ! The cab ! - Wait , wait , wait . You 're driving ? - Okay . What the hell was that ? Go , go , go , go , go , go ! [ Brakes screech ] Peter ... I made a skid . There . The elevators . Walter ! Peter . Hello . Nina ! Are you a sight for sore eyes ! We 're looking for Olivia . - Olivia ? - We think she 's in an office near the top on the north side . Walter thinks it 's Bell 's office . Okay . This elevator is the fastest one . It will take you directly to the private lobby of the upper floors . [ Elevator bell dings ] Walter ! Oh ! Come on . [ Elevator bell dings ] Whoa ... Okay . She tried to kill us . You saw . Why is everyone trying to kill us ? - I don 't like this place . - Me neither . [ Elevator bell dings ] Olivia ? You in there ? [ Whispers ] Careful , Peter . We don 't know what her mind 's put on the other side of this door . We should be ready for anything . Belly . I lied . Olivia 's not here . I was concerned if you knew it was just me , Peter wouldn 't let you come rescue me . Belly ... Why are you a cartoon ? I 'd ask yourselves the same question . ( Bell ) I found myself on the street , but neither of you were nearby . And then a car tried to run me down . So I came here . I assumed it would be a safe haven ... But then I encountered Nina . I don 't understand . If this is all a projection of Olivia 's mind , why is everything turning against us ? When she came to us in the lab , she asked for help . What I 'm starting to think is that when my mind entered hers , her ego became confused ... Her sense of self . ( Walter ) Which , in turn , initiated the darker part of her subconscious allowing her deepest fears to run rampant . Explain that . We 're saying that Olivia is not aware that Belly 's consciousness entered hers . As far as she 's concerned , one minute she was fine , the next minute she was set adrift in her innermost thoughts . It 's her fears that are causing the siege . Then , in that case , she 's not lost , she 's hiding . That 's what she does . When Olivia is afraid , she retreats . That 's not good . - And being lost is ? - Yes , it 's better . I expected there to be a logical trail whereby we could track her because Olivia wanted to be found . If she 's hiding ... I 'm afraid we 're looking for a needle in a haystack . He 's right . Everything in her mind is dangerous and hostile to her now . How can we expect to find her if she 's frightened of everything , us included ? Because she 'd do exactly what you did ... She 'll find a place that she considers to be safe . And she 'll hide out . There 's an entire world out there with no rhyme or reason . Where would you like to start ? [ Classical music plays ] Hey ... I know you said only water , but ... It might be good if you can eat something . But if you want , I can take it away . That 's fine too . Whatever you like . Thank you ... for this . What you 're feeling right now , it 's just the effects of the LSD . - But it 's temporary . - No . It 's infinite . It 's all around us . You didn 't see that . I didn 't see that . But now I know . And I know it followed me . What followed you ? Death . I saw death . All of it . [ Breath shudders ] And it was me . Can you hold my hand ? Please . [ Classical music continues ] [ Bird cries ] Well , Peter ? The first place I would look is Jacksonville . Jacksonville 's the last place she 'd go . Exactly . That 's my point . I know Olivia . She knows that that 's the last place anybody would look for her . We only have so much time , Peter . Are you sure ? Yes . Let 's get to Jacksonville . [ Tires screeching ] I assume that 's about us . [ Door thuds open ] [ Grunting , groaning ] The zeppelin . Peter ! [ Growling continues ] Come on , son ! [ Birds crying ] We should circumnavigate the currents . I should have known . Should have known what , Walter ? When we were over there ... Getting Peter back , and we were on that stage ... You said good-bye to me . I should have known you had no intentions of dying that day . As long as I 've known you , you 've hated good-byes . I guess that 's true . I need you , William . I don 't know what to do . About Peter . About the machine . About what 's waiting for him ... For the world because of what we did . Walter , when we were young and foolish with too much power and too many dreams that no one could stand in the way of ... We needed each other . I don 't understand . We needed each other then , to check and balance . And now ? Now you possess the wisdom of humility . We didn 't back then . The decisions you make will be the right ones . The direction you choose to take will be just . [ Alarm buzzes ] What 's that ? Fuel gauge . How many are up there ? It 's just me . This is a flare gun . You don 't want to get shot with a flare gun . - Peter ... - Walter , stay back ! Who are you ? What 's your name ? Peter . Peter what ? Peter Bishop . Nice to meet you . [ Flare shot ] Peter ! Peter ! Walter ! Ahh ! [ Thud ] Walter ! You 're here with us . You 're back in the lab . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm back . I 'm back . Oh , damn . [ Sighs ] I 'm back . ( Bell ) Your father 'll be fine , Peter . He knows there 's no time to come back . And even if he tried , he would never find us . We 're on our own . Who was that guy ? Someone unpleasant from her past , I imagine . This way . We 'll need to take possession of a vehicle . Do you drive a motorcycle ? I would love to ride on a motorcycle ... Hold on . You 're going the wrong way . I 've got ten years of experience in Jacksonville . We 're on East Union Street . It leads to the Matthews ' Expressway . If you want to get to the Jacksonville Day Care Center ... She won 't be at the day care center . We need to go that way . I thought you said she was that way . And I thought you said you wanted to travel by motorcycle . ( Walter ) The computer 's nearly ready to receive Belly 's consciousness . [ Tweeting ] ( Walter ) Hand me those tubes , dear . [ Whistling ] This should snap right in . Damn my hands ! Walter , it 's okay . I can get you another one . There isn 't another one . I 'll have to modify the ECL 82 tube from my phonograph . And I 'll need tinfoil and instant glue and a 60-watt light bulb . And hurry , dear ! Where are we going , Peter ? Olivia told me she lived on the military base ! Olivia once told me that she sometimes thinks about what it would be like to just be normal . She said she falls asleep sometimes thinking about what it would be like if her life hadn 't taken the turn that it did . She told me that the last time she remembered feeling that way was the day before she met you and Walter at the Cortexiphan trials . I think she 's down there somewhere . In that house , on that day . Hiding out . They 're all the same . How will we find her ? Her real dad painted the door red . He told her that it was good luck . The army told them it was against regulations , but he was an important man , so they let it slide . There aren 't many streets left , Peter . Maybe the door was painted green again after they moved away . It wasn 't . What are you waiting for ? What if I 'm wrong ? What if she 's not in there ? I 've taken us so far off course ... You should have thought of that back at the zeppelin . Peter . Olivia . It 's okay . I 'm so afraid . I don 't know what 's happening . There are all these people trying to hurt me , and this was the safest place I knew . I know , and I 'm here to help you . But we don 't have a lot of time , so I can 't explain it all right now , but I need you to understand that you 're safe . It 's okay for you to come back . Peter ? What 's wrong ? Peter , you 're scaring me . You 're not her . What are you talking about ? This is not you . I can see it in your eyes . It 's not you . I just needed to know it was you . Olivia ? People have been tricking me , but I knew the real you would recognize me . Oh , no . [ Footsteps ] [ Dramatic music ] Run ! ( Bell ) Peter , this way ! Peter ? [ Gasps ] [ Grunting ] Peter , Peter , Peter ! Peter , Peter , Peter , it 's okay ! - Calm down , son ! - Walter ! Walter , she 's here . I found her ! She 's here ! I gotta go back , Walter . - Shh , shh , shh . - I gotta go back . They 're gonna get her . - Walter , what do I do ? - Nothing , dear . Nothing . All we can do is wait . It 's up to Belly now . Come on , breathe . In and out . Hey ... Hey ... Hey ... Oh , I lost her . I lost her . [ Dramatic music ] [ Tires screech ] Go ! No more . I 'm not afraid of you . How ? I suspect I know what has happened here . I think my experiment was right after all . You should have been safe inside your mind ... Except it 's you , and you have never felt safe . You are your own worst enemy , Olivia . You took the opportunity to let your fears overwhelm you , but you just fought back . In the end , you are as strong as Walter and I always believed you were . And now you know it too . So what happens now ? Now , you go back . But not me . For you to survive , I need to leave . I don 't understand . You don 't have to . [ Thunder clap ] Well , that 's Walter . Right on time . Please tell Walter that I knew the dog wouldn 't hunt . [ Thunder clap ] Olivia ? Hi . You lie there and rest . One consciousness . One glorious consciousness ! What happened to me ? What do you remember ? I remember you . And I remember William Bell was there . Walter . It didn 't work . He 's gone . William 's gone . Walter ... I think Bell gave me a message . He said tell Walter that I knew the dog wouldn 't hunt . Walter , what does that mean ? When we would do experiments , he would use that expression when he knew something wouldn 't work . But he suggested the computer . It was his idea . Exactly . He knew he wasn 't coming out . And he hates good-byes . Welcome back , Olivia . Thank you . Walter ? I downloaded Zoom for you . ( Kids ) ♪ Come on and zoom zoom zoom-a zoom ... ♪ I can watch it with you if you 'd like . ♪ Zoom zoom zoom-a zoom ... ♪ ♪ Everybody 's doing it , everybody ... ♪ If you don 't mind ... I 'd just like to be alone for a while longer . Okay . Take your time . [ Zoom continues in background ] [ Knock at door ] [ Laughs ] Well , you look better than the last time I saw you . Yeah . It 's amazing what a couple of hours will do for a guy . - Hi . - Hi . You hungry ? Uh , no . I 'm okay , thanks . So how you feeling ? Um ... [ Laughs ] I feel like I 've just woken up from a really strange dream . Thank you for coming to get me . It 's not as dangerous as crossing into another universe , but I try . You 're welcome . [ Laughs ] What are we gonna have to deal with next , right ? I don 't know . But for some reason , I 'm not afraid to move forward anymore . [ Clatter ] Sure you don 't want some toast ? No , I ... No , I 'm fine . Who is this guy ? I saw him in your mind . You had him locked up in a zeppelin . He was just flying around trapped in there . I don 't know . I haven 't seen him before . But I think that he 's the man who 's gonna kill me .

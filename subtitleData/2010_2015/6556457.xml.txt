 This is insane . They can take your time , just like that . Or you can take theirs . This is insane . Yeah , it 's insane . We should be safe here until dawn . I pay by the day . It 'll take them a while to find me . This is your place ? There 's water . It 's cold , but it 's something . You can put on fresh clothes . Where 's your family ? My mother timed out . This is her dress . Yeah . What about your father ? He died when I was a boy . He was a fighter . Strong arm . He wasn 't the strongest , but he knew how to win . How do you win ? I 'll show you . What you do is let them have the upper hand . Then , he 'd let his time go all the way down . Because he knew that when you were down to your last seconds and they think it 's over , they start watching your clock and forget to watch their own . He died in a fight ? I think he was killed for giving away what he won . He wasn 't just giving them time . He was giving them hope . How long have you been this old ? Twenty-five for three . Twenty-five for two . What was it like when your clock started ? I was in the street . It almost knocked me over . My year was gone in a week , we were so in debt . After that , I lived day to day . Mine was a little different . It woke me . I looked in the mirror . I guess everybody does . That 's what you 're gonna look like for the rest of your life . My dad gave me a decade to celebrate . You must hate me . Where I come from . It 's nobody 's fault , what they 're born with . They open in a minute . Let 's see how generous your father is now . The Timekeepers would have never let him do it . You don 't have to say that . How do you think my father built all those buildings ? By giving away a thousand years ? Now what ? You can go home . There 's people on the streets . I can move without being spotted . What have you got ? Eleven hours . How does anyone live like this ? You don 't generally sleep in . You can call for help . I 'll watch from here , I 'll make sure you 're safe . You know , you could fight this . I can say that running to the ghetto was my idea . My father 'd believe that , he thinks I 'm reckless . He has a lot of influence , Will . He can get you a lawyer . He can make a deal with those Timekeepers . I 'm pretty sure that Timekeeper doesn 't make deals . What are you going to do ? Steal ? Is it stealing if it 's already stolen ? Here . Just in case . I 'll be right here . Please deposit one minute . - Father ? - Sylvia ? You couldn 't spare a second , Father ? I wish I could say I 'm surprised . Did you hear what I just said ? You know I 'd do anything for you . They 're coming to get you . They know where you are . Will , look out ! Sorry to disappoint you , we don 't keep much on us . To discourage thieves like you . Think of this as a gift . Will ! Come on ! I didn 't mean to shoot him . I wanted to scare him . I think you did both . You could say thank you . Thank you . What have you got ? Nine hours . Why did you give him time ? You should have taken it . Timekeepers live day to day . It 'll be hours before the others show up . He could die in the ghetto . He still might . Timekeeper , what 's the hurry ? Stay a while . You might like us if you got to know us ! They 're going to think you 're with me . Yes . This is a mess . Welcome to my world . Back off ! You 've been shot . I was worried you timed out . Where 'd you get that ? What are we going to do ? We can 't keep driving around in this car . It 's a cop car . So let 's make an arrest . Was I going too fast ? Not fast enough . The mistake you made was stopping . Now , let 's see who you got back there . Got to be a year or two nobody 's using . Whoa ! It went off . I was just trying to help . Come on . Now , I 'd say , " Your money or your life , " but since your money is your life ... How dare you steal from me ? - Don 't think of it as stealing . - No ? Think of it as repossession . I 'll leave you with what I 've had most every day of my life . - One day . - One day ? Are you insane ? You can do a lot in a day . Those are pretty . I owe you these . You shouldn 't have . You , out . Will Salas , prime suspect in the murder of Henry Hamilton , is believed to be traveling with Sylvia Weis , daughter of finance magnate , Philippe Weis . Citizens are advised to exercise extreme ... We look cute together . It doesn 't say you 're wanted . It doesn 't say I 'm not . You 've forgotten I shot a cop . I admit , not very well . It was your first time . Hey . I can say I made you do all of it . You can go back . Go back to what ? Do I really want to spend my whole life trying not to die by mistake ? A lot of people would say being here is a mistake . I don 't have a choice . I 'm starting to think that I don 't , either . I want to reassure you all there is no cause for alarm . No ransom was paid . Your Zone is at risk , Philippe . It puts us at risk . It can spreed . Too much time in the wrong hands can crash the market . This hostage situation will be quickly resolved . Sir . Everything is under control . We 'll talk soon . Timekeeper . After this regrettable incident , it 's really not necessary for you to come in person . I 'm afraid it really is necessary . When can we hope for a rescue ? I believe that 's the point . She doesn 't appear to want to be rescued . Mr. Leon . Raymond . May I call you Raymond ? I blame myself . I invited the man into my home . He had so much time , how was I supposed to know ? Of course , Sylvia brought this on herself by her lack of vigilance . That 's why I always tried to keep her close . But she is clearly under Will Salas ' control . If it 's a matter of resources , I 'm happy to make a contribution . It 's a scandal , what we pay our Timekeepers . I 've issued a warrant for your daughter 's arrest . If she contacts you and you assist her in any way , I will issue a warrant for your arrest . There is nothing I cannot buy . Now how many of my years do you want ? There aren 't enough years , even in your lifetime , Mr. Weis . Good night . This is called a trigger . And you don 't pull it until you actually want to shoot something . I wanted to shoot something . Right . Will , if you get a lot of time , are you really gonna give it away ? I 've only ever had a day . How much do you need ? How can you live with yourself watching people die right next to you ? You don 't watch . You close your eyes . I can help you get all the time you want . I need to borrow a month . What 's the interest ? Today 's rate , 30 % . I can 't pay it back . We can always come to some arrangement . Let 's go . Ladies and gentlemen , I am happy to announce that Weis Timelenders is now offering interest-free loans with no payments . Ever . So help yourselves and take a day . Take a month . Hell , take a year . Come on . Help yourselves ! Take it . Take the time. it 's free . No one 's watching their clocks , huh ? Get out of here , or I 'll confiscate every second ! Must 've thought it was a drive-through . Turn around . Don 't move . I don 't have much . Everything I have , I give away . I know . Yes , sir , I do know that , sir . There are years that shouldn 't be there . I will stop him , sir . Doesn 't he understand he 's hurting the very people he 's trying to help ? Well , now . - Look at all that . - Yeah . I finally had time to buy one of these . Let 's not do anything I might regret . What was that about ? I wasted 30 days . Today , Sylvia Weis withdrew some of her " inheritance " when she and Will Salas robbed her father 's time bank for the sixth time in a week . I give her everything . Does she want to kill me ? You were killing her , Philippe . You were suffocating her . You suffocate us all . Call . That 's good . Just not as good as that . Ooh ! You haven 't forgotten how to play cards . Why did I play strip poker with you ? Why did you ? Sir . They 're still there . How did you know , sir ? This is where the hours and the days are . He 's paid them all off . This is where I would hide . Put your clothes on . Stop ! - We 're trapped ! - No , we 're not ! Jump . They won 't do it . We shouldn 't do it . Come on ! See ? They won 't jump . So much for your theory . Shit ! Here ! Go ! Stop ! Stop ! I 'm telling you , he 'll give up before we do ! You sure about that ? No . - Go . - I can 't . You can ! Go ! Un-fucking-believable ! Hold on . You two look familiar . How about now ? Welcome to the Century . Hi . We 're looking for a quiet place to stay . How many rooms ? All of them . We were hoping for something long-term . Can we rely on the discretion of your staff ? I 'm sure you can . I 'm sorry . We 're fully booked . Right . Nobody goes anywhere ! Wait , whoa , whoa . Don 't look at me . You know who I 'm looking for . I 'm looking for whoever gave this man a month ! And I 'm gonna clean the clocks off of every one of you in this hellhole until someone says something I want to hear . I can 't hear anything . Clean it . No , wait , wait . Wait . Please ! Please don 't . Please . I don 't know where they are ! Please . Please ! Please . I believe you 're next . Um ... At last , someone 's acting reasonably . I just want a share of the reward . My young friend . You 'll get your reward . Ten years . That 's insulting . If they catch us , there 's no way they won 't kill us , is there ? Do you regret this ? You saved my life . When ? Now . And every day since I met you . You forget , I almost got you killed a few times , too . I 'm willing to overlook that . How 's the poor little rich girl ? I never got a chance to properly thank you for your time . I 'm not surprised you stayed . It 's the life , isn 't it ? Here we don 't stop living until we 're actually dead . There are a lot more ways to die around here . But here , there 's dancing before dying . Of course , it 's your friend I 'm most happy to run into again . You 've been causing a lot of trouble , which is normally my job . Don 't you understand ? The reason the Timekeepers leave me alone is ' cause I have boundaries . I steal from my own people . You surely know things are bad when I have to restore order . Fortunately for you , I don 't like to kill a man in cold blood . I do it . But I prefer not to . I think you deserve a fighting chance . We play to zero . What 's the point ? I lose , I die . I win , they kill me . If you don 't fight , I 'll kill you now . And her ? After I take you , I 'll take her . Oh , yeah . And her time . Then I 'll collect my reward for making everything right in the world . This way ! All the time he 's taken . Don 't you mean the time he 's given away , sir ? Even to you ? I have given 50 years of my life to this job . I am not about to see those years go to waste . Goon . I 'm sorry to be the one to break this to you , but by tomorrow you won 't have time to stand around . God damn it . It 's over . We lost . We 're not doing any good . At least we 're trying . No . You don 't understand . All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living . A hundred years . Two . A thousand . It does nothing . So , what ? We just stop fighting ? We can 't win . We can 't hurt them . The time we 're taking makes no damn difference ! What would ? What would hurt them ? A million years . You got a million years on you ? I guess it really would take a million years . Let 's give up . Stop ! I am Sylvia Weis . I want to surrender , but only to my father . Sylvia . Hello , Daddy . Stay where you are ! You 've hired more guards since I last saw you . Thanks to you , I need them . One too many . Guns down . Now ! Do it . Let 's go for a ride . You 'd steal from your own father . Is it stealing if it 's already stolen ? What 's the combination ? Well , it 's not my birthday . You 've started to regret that day , I imagine , Father . Try 12-2-18-09 . Darwin 's birthday . Survival of the fittest . It cost us centuries just to bribe our way in here . Let 's see what it got us . Quality time . There really is a man with a million years . That 's my first million . It won 't be my last . You know how much good it could do ? I know how much harm it could do . Try to understand , even if you gave a year to a million people , you 're just prolonging their agony . You 're prolonging their lives . Flooding the wrong Zone with a million years , it could cripple the system . Let 's hope so . We 're not meant to live like this . We 're not meant to live forever . Although I do wonder , Father , if you 've ever lived a day in your life . Is that so ? You might upset the balance for a generation . Two . But don 't fool yourself . In the end , nothing will change . Because everyone wants to live forever . They all think they have a chance at immortality even though all the evidence is against it . They all think they will be the exception . But the truth is , for a few to be immortal , many must die . No one should be immortal if even one person has to die . What was that ? What was that ? What just happened ? It must be a mistake . A million years just went off the clock in New Greenwich . It 's not a mistake . It 's gotta be a mistake , sir . It 's not a mistake . It 's them . Take a month , Maurice . Dispatch , what can you see ? There 's a lot of traffic in the vicinity , sir . All right , look for the slowest car . You have a million years . You are definitely not in a hurry . If this works ... If this works , we gotta get more . Dayton 's not the only zone that can use a few extra years . And wire me my per diem . Wait . Never mind . I have him . Give the order , shoot on sight . In New Greenwich ? That 's against policy , sir . So is having a million years leave the Zone . That time cannot leave the Zone ! Shoot on sight ! Please deposit one month . Please deposit one month . Keep going ! Keep going ! We 're close ! We 're okay ! We 're okay ! You 're late . Need a minute ? Go . Go . Where 's our capsule ? Too late . Lost a lot of time , Mr. Leon . Looks like you 're about out yourself . - Time ! - There 's time ! Move ! Move ! You , get out ! Get out ! We gotta get to Livingston . We can make it . Can we ? You okay ? Stop ! You can run . So can you . You 're from here , aren 't you ? Long time ago . Yeah . I worked out how to escape . And now you make sure no one else does . That 's the way it has to be . I didn 't start the clock . I can 't turn it back . I keep it running . I keep time . " I keep time . " I 'm gonna need some of that time you borrowed from me . Unless you want us to die on the way to our execution . Time . We don 't have enough . One of us can make it . Take mine . You take mine . You can get there , I can 't ! I can 't get there . You can . - No . No . - Yes ! Please . No . There 's time . - What ? - The Keeper 's time . Run . Run ! Run ! I need time . Time transfer . What have we got ? A day . Could do a lot in a day . Sir , do something . It 's already done . These are live pictures from Dayton . Citizens have taken to the streets . There 's so much stolen time in circulation . Fa stories in Dayton lie idle . And now , citizens are crossing Zones , seen here entering New Greenwich . While authorities claim they have the situation under control , others fear the system may be headed for collapse . We will continue to update you on this developing story . Sir , we lost Zone Eight . And Ten . It 's spreading . What do we do , sir ? Go home . Still no sign of fugitives Will Salas and Sylvia Weis . Authorities continue to ask for the public ' 5 help in bringing these criminals to justice . Told you there were bigger banks . You almost missed your calling . English - US - SDH

 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason . Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . Trey 're coming ! Who 's coming , David ? The Lucian alliance , they 're coming to take Destiny . They 've got something to open the doors ! Take cover ! Grenade ! Fall back ! You 'll be okay . What happened ? You were shot . You are surrounded . Lay down your weapons , or we will vent the entire compartment to space . Can they do it ? Yes . Then they should have . Rush , wait ! We will not be complying with your request to surrender . We have 12 missing , presumed captured . , including Riley , T.J. , Chloe , and Eli . I 'm going to save every one of those hostages , and I 'm going to re-take this ship . Do you understand me ? This is Young . We 've got the medical supplies you requested . We are prepared to give them to you as a show of good faith . Thank you . One condition . You and I meet to make the exchange . Agreed . Let 's do this . Brody ? Ready . Remember , quick kills . Center mass . Yes , sir . All right . You ready to do this ? We 're ready . Bring the medic . Open the door . I 'm in . Who 's this ? Ronald Greer is also a medic . Another offer of good faith ? In exchange for it . Johansen . First things first . Go and check the supplies and see they 're what you need . Hold your fire ! Don 't shoot ! No , no , no ! Power just went out throughout the whole ship ! I can see that , mr Brody . Please step aside . T.J. Get behind me . She takes one step in your direction , and I will shoot her myself . I 've got the shot , sir . My men have been ordered to execute the prisoners , if I am killed . Step back in my direction . Sir , I 've got the shot . Stand down , Sergeant . Dammit . What happened ? They surprised us . What do you mean ? They surprised us . Do you want me to explain it again ? The hostages are useless to us if they 're dead ! At least they serve a purpose . Tell them . Tell them ! Colonel ... I 'm here . She just killed Rivers . Understood . Hey , don 't fall asleep . It 's dangerous . That 's a concussion . Okay , then ... It 's boring . So , what do you think they 'll do with them ? Who ? The prisoners . Probably drop them off on some planet . I don 't know . I just hope everyone 's okay . I just hope it 's over . Well , not much we can do about it ... So , rest time is over . Ah , this feels familiar . What the hell just happened ? We still don 't know . We 're just getting systems back online . Then maybe we can analyze ... Screw analyze ! Fix it ! We 've got to know what 's broken first . Do it now ! Rivers is dead . What ? Well , it was going to be someone . Would you prefer it was Chloe or Eli ? Lieutenant Johansen , perhaps ? Don 't bloody tell me you weren 't thinking the same thing . I want you to figure out what 's wrong with the ship And fix it . Fix it now . I have orders to help . What 's your name ? Koz . I 'll let you know what I need . You do know there is a way to save them . You 're just not wired to consider it . I 'm not surrendering this ship . And what exactly is so wonderful about it ? We give up , she kills everyone except for those who have value to her , and let me tell you , that 's not a hell of a lot of people . Colonel ? This is Young . I would like to speak to the civilian . This is Camile Wray . Colonel Young has proved that he cannot be trusted . Can you ? Yes . Then why did you allow them to plan an ambush ? I voiced my disagreement . And you could not stop them . No , obviously not . For that , one of your men was killed . If you fail to live up to your promise twice , I will kill again . Do you understand ? No , I don 't understand , But I do believe you . Then I would like to take you up On your initial offer , With one modification . Four of your men for four of ours , And food and water for three days . Will food and water be offered to the hostages ? They 're no good to me dead . Then we 're agreed . Next time we take supplies with us in the first wave . If there is a next time . Dammit . Flashlight , flashlight ! What 's happening ? Well , I don 't know , koz . I 'm up to my wrists in somebody 's body right now . Do we have any answers yet ? Just the one . Every crash has been exactly 46 minutes , 37.4 seconds apart . So ? Well , it 'll be easier to show you . Brody ? Okay , so , what am I looking at ? That 's our problem . It 's a binary pulsar . It 's the combination of a rotating neutron star And probably a white dwarf Orbiting around a single point in space . What does that mean to us ? Pulsars give off gamma radiation and x-rays As they rotate , Short deadly bursts of ionized radiation . The shield and the hull are protecting us right now . Right , but the pulsar is literally Feeding off of the white dwarf , Stripping off material and creating an accretion disk . And the white dwarf plows through that material Every orbit ... Which gives off an even bigger gamma ray burst On top of what we 're already getting hit with , And that 's why our systems are shutting down . The shield has to draw extra power In order to compensate . And that happens every 46 minutes , 37.4 seconds . It 's what 's killed their man , And it 's going to be what kills us . The Lucian alliance just happened to dial in when the damn thing was in range . Destiny had to drop out of FTL to make the connection . It 's bad timing , bad luck . Well , then , why are we still here ? Our FTL capability has been compromised . Compromised ... Don 't yell . We don 't know why yet . The shield is what 's keeping us alive , but sooner or later , it 's going to fail , and when it does ... We 're dead . Yeah . The radiation burst is what 's causing the system malfunctions . Which will only get worse . Because the shield will fail eventually , yes . Unless we can find a way to make the jump to FTL . How much time ? Well , according to Rush , We can withstand two more of the bursts . People will start dying by the third . I saw what one of those bursts did to a man When he wasn 't protected by the ship 's hull . First we 'll make the trade , And then we 'll discuss this new problem . Has their medic completed Varro 's surgery ? Not yet . Well , then , find out what 's taking so long . I 'll do it . Lieutenant , she told me to check on your progress . Tell her it 'd be a hell of a lot faster If the damn lights didn 't keep going off . Well , that 's a whole other problem . Destiny came out of FTL within range of a pulsar . We don 't have much time before the shield fails . Colonel Young and his people are trying to solve it , but ... She won 't let them . I 'll do my best to convince her . You do that . Lieutenant Scott ? We 've got the supplies that they requested , And we 're ready to make the prisoner exchange . Copy that . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . And Varro ? I 've done all I can for him . Hold it steady . Here , use this one . Will he live ? I got the bullet out and stopped the bleeding , So he should have a chance . I 'd like to take a look at the other wounded . Fine . Let 's go . You got it ? Camile ? Camile ? What 's this ? A flak vest . Just in case . How can I expect them to trust me If I can 't even demonstrate a willingness to trust them In turn ? With all due respect , ma 'am , I don 't think they can be trusted . You tell Colonel Young I appreciate his concern . Yeah , the Colonel said you wouldn 't take it . I just thought I 'd try anyway . Are you sure about this , sir ? No . Good enough for me . I hope you make a better impression than I did . Commander Kiva , are you ready ? We are . Brody , open it . Lieutenant , thank you . I 'll take it from here . Okay , Mr. Brody . I asked for civilians . These are the two we had . We agreed on four for four . Four . What about Lieutenant Johansen ? She stays . Even if we figure out a way to jump back into FTL , and right now , the odds are not good ... Then we 'll be right back where we started . Yes , But this doesn 't have to end With one of us losing . If we could just figure out a way to work with each other ... I can see that you 're someone Who enjoys talking through problems , But if you don 't solve this new one , Then neither of us will have anything to talk about . Brody . All right , get in the infirmary . Where 's Chloe and Eli ? She said they were the only two civilians . Then where the hell are they ? It 's gonna be just ... Oh , sorry , sorry . Sorry ... Take a break , Eli . No , no , no ! We 've got to be getting close by now . You know what ? We should do this twice a week . This is the kind of exercise that really motivates me . Carrying a wounded person the length of the whole ship in low oxygen ? Good times . Thank you , Eli . Wait till it 's your turn to carry me . You 're an amazing friend . You can never have too many of those . Unless you 're one of those people on Facebook who just accepts everybody 's friend request . It 's like , come on , you know , be a little selective . Eli ! Dammit ! Sorry . Sorry ... It 's okay . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . Sorry . Okay , thanks . There 's no sign of Eli or Chloe . You know , maybe they ... There 's no fatalities on our side except for Rivers . They must be hiding somewhere . I hope so . Look , that boy would take a bullet before he 'd let them touch a hair on her head . Lieutenant ... Don 't get distracted . I 'm not , I 'm not , I just ... I just want to get this done with . And I wish the Colonel would give the word so that we can go in there and properly resolve the situation . Look , he 'll do the right thing when the right time comes . You got to trust that , 100 % . I don 't know how you do it , man . Well , you need to learn . Thank you . Your commander already showed her appreciation By not killing me . It must be difficult To be forced to save the life of your enemy . No . I would have done it anyway . How 's the pain ? Bearable . Look , I 'm trying to say ... I don 't really care . I 've been on my feet for far too long , And I have other patients , So excuse me . Conserving air , or unconscious ? Just thinking . About what ? I used to think I had a lot of friends , But I don 't . They 're a billion light years away , But they 're still your friends . No , they don 't really care about me . And I don 't really care about them either . That 's nice . No , no , because until I met you , I didn 't really know what a friend was . Do you know what I mean , Eli ? No . A friend is someone who will support you no matter what . Like you . Chloe , why don 't we ... And I am not just saying that because I feel like I 'm going to pass out , and even if I do , I just want to say it first ... And you did , so ... But whenever I say stuff like that to you , you always react like I 've just awarded you some runner-up prize , And it 's not . I know . It 's ... It 's just that ... I know . Of course you do . Hey ... There 's a console over there . I didn 't notice that when we came in . And it 's got power . Can you call for help ? I can try . Dr. Park ? Look , it 's not much of a solution , but we don 't have to shield the entire ship . Just the side facing the pulsar , right ? Right . We 'll have to leave some shielding On the underside of the ship , But we should be able to transfer something like 90 % . Should buy us enough time to restore FTL capability . So why haven 't you guys done it yet ? Because it can 't be done from inside the ship . Well , it could if we had control of the core systems ... No , no , look , look , someone 's got to have to go for a walk . I can tell you where to go and what to do . The mechanics of it are relatively simple . Well , then why don 't you put on a space suit And do it ? Well , you get the FTL drive back online while I 'm gone , And you got a deal . We 'll get it done , sir . I know you will . Gear up . They have only the time between the gamma ray bursts to complete their work . The next one Is less than 20 minutes from now , so obviously time is an issue . So what do you need from us ? There 's a hull breach in the access corridor that 's under your control . It 's the exit point closest to the array . We need you to let us in . Transfer control of all the ship systems to us , and we will let them in . You do understand that if you don 't help us save this ship , we will all die . Oh , I understand completely , and I want you to transfer the ship 's systems to us . When was the last time you ran a security sweep in there ? Never mind , I 'll do it . Radio ? Calvos , this is Telford . Give me access to the damaged section . You tell me . You think she 's bluffing ? She doesn 't have to . She knows who she 's dealing with . But to be fair , You don 't have much of a choice . At least they 'll keep some us alive , For a while , anyway . Yeah , like you . You forget I 've recently been in their employment . I wouldn 't envy me just yet . David ? Yeah , Everett . It 's about damn time . Listen , do it . Transfer control of the ship and surrender yourselves . Everyone but Rush and Brody . Have them retreat to one of the auxiliary control rooms . They 're going to notice Rush is missing . Tell them he panicked and ran away . They 'll believe it . By the time they start looking for him , it 'll be too late . At the first available opportunity , I 'll access one of the gateroom consoles And transfer control of the ship back to Rush . The second they find out , They 're going to start shooting prisoners . Then I won 't let them find out . Not right away , anyway . I won 't lock them out completely . They can have control of the ship Until I decide they can 't . They 'll herd all of the prisoners Into one compartment . If they don 't , I 'll suggest it . When they do , I 'll contact Rush on this channel , I 'll tell him which compartment , Then he can vent the atmosphere from all the surrounding ones . Where are you going to be ? You let me worry about that . I got to go . It 's all clear . Best not to stick around . This is Colonel Young . I am prepared to surrender control of this ship Provided certain conditions are met . Go ahead . I need you to guarantee me The safety of my people . Agreed . Nobody gets hurt during the changeover , and no retribution afterwards . Anything else ? That 's all . Well , Mr. Brody , Time to panic and run off . Hold on a sec . We just got a message From an unexplored part of the ship . It 's Eli . What are we going to do ? Well , you got to go . Good luck . Yeah , you too . Transfer control to them . Anything ? I wrote it in ancient , so it could take a while for somebody to ... What is it ? We got a message . What 's it say ? Oh , no ! We 'd better stay put . Transfer complete . Open them . No shooting . That 's a good sign . I think the stitching is torn . You 're moving around too much . I understand your anger at losing the ship , But it wasn 't really yours to begin with . When all this is settled , Past sins on both sides will have to be forgiven . Truce ? Open them . 46 minutes , gentlemen . Yes , sir . They 're in . Attenuating the shield strength in that compartment . Dialing back artificial gravity . Commander , one of the power relays just went down . Something wrong ? We lost a power relay . Then why aren 't you dealing with it ? Go . Go ! I can open and close doors . This is it ? Yeah , it 's where he said it was going to be . No , no , no ! What happened ? The transfers just stopped . What 's the matter ? It won 't lock . Colonel Young , this is Scott . How are we doing for time ? 14 minutes . This is Calvos . Kiva and Telford have both been shot . The commander is still breathing but unconscious . Get them to the medic . Yes , sir . Is there any sign of the enemy ? None . Where are your men ? What ? Your soldiers . How did they get into the gateroom ? I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . I 've got people outside this ship ! The enemy has somehow breached our lines . Both Telford and Kiva have been shot . I 'm assuming command . Colonel Young , this is Scott . Ready to come back in . Lower the shield . I repeat , this is Scott , over . The shield is still up . We cannot get back inside . They just saved our damn lives . Lower the shield . Keep moving . Lower the damn shield ! Lower the shield . Try a different channel ! This is Scott . Please respond ! Lieutenant , something 's gone wrong . We have to find you another way back inside the ship . No , no , no , there 's no time for that , Rush ! Whoa , whoa , what other way is there ? There 's an airlock in the forward section . Yeah , we think it 's an airlock . It 's in a totally unexplored part of the ship . Besides , we can 't open it from here . Eli ... Eli . Lieutenant , I need you to head back Towards the front of the ship . Negative , negative ! Listen to me , that 's the way in . We 're looking at the way in right now . You need to go there as quickly as you can . Go right now . We 're on our way . What 's going on ? I 'm getting a message . What 's it say ? That I gotta go . What do you mean ? I 'm telling them where you are , So you 'll be safe until they come . Where are you going ? Whatever happens , you know , right ? Eli , you 're scaring me . I gotta go . Eli ! Calvos ... What happened ? Come on ... Separate the civilians . Take them to another compartment . This is Varro . What are you doing ? I 'm going to put an end to this . Bring their injured soldiers to me . Not if you expect me to save your commander . They 're not going to make it .

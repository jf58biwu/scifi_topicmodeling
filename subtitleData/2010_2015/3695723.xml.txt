 My name is Anna . We are of peace , always . Nothing can take away from the excitement As we open our doors to a nation from beyond our imagination . They 're caing themselves " the visitors . " The visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . They 've disguised Their appearance by cloning human flesh Over their own reptilian skin . They 'll take over unless we can stop them . My partner was one of them . Anyone could be a visitor . They are animals . No , not all of them . There 's others out there like me . They 're called the fifth column . We 'll help . It is really important tme that you don 't get involved With the visitors . I joined the peace ambassadors . If my mom knew , she 'd go ballistic . Tyler 's the one . You should use him . You 're doing an excellent job . Thank you , mother . Bring him up to the ship . Tell him I wanna meet him . There are hundreds of images being captured by The damn jackets . Why don 't they just annihilate us and get it over with ? They need us for something . We want to provide complete medical services to all . Mr. Decker , may we have a word before you go ? You think I 'm gonna die ? The good news is we can heal you . We 've developed a vitamin supplement . R-6 . It 's what they 're putting in their vitamin shot . This is part of something much bigger . Keep this as evidence . The rest we destroy . The warehouse containing all of the r-6 compound Has been lost . We have to stop this now . I got some news today . I 'm pregnant . Who are you ? How 'd you get in here ? where am I ? it 's okay , Jack . You 're at the v healing center . You 're in good hands . Hey , this is Brandon . Leave a message . It 's Tyler 's mom . He 's - he 's not answering my calls . I know he 's on the v ship . I 've been calling all night . Call me back , please . Aah ! Aah ! Nice try . Stings like hell , But my heart 's on the other side . Aah . I bet that stings like hell , too . Wow , someone 's hungry . Guess you 're eating for two now , right ? More like ten . This is my third omelet . I don 't think my appetite 's normal . I 'm only six weeks . Most women tend to lose their appetites In the first trimester . You really gotta go easy , okay ? This isn 't your average pregnancy . What do you mean ? I 'm talking about your heart condition . Yeah , sweetheart , we really need to be careful with that . Ohh . What ? What ? What ? I ... I think I just felt the baby move . How is that possible ? Let me see . No , I don 't feel anything . But listen , let 's just get you to come over and sit down . I want you to sit down and sl down . We 've hardly had any time to get used to all this , But I 'm sure everything is gonna be fine , okay ? Yeah . all right . just relax . Yeah , you 're right . Anyway , the o.B. Wil Next week ? That was fast . Yeah , I was nervous , so I had the appointment pushed up . All our questions will be answered then . Yeah ? It 's Erica . I 've just been attacked . They have my son . This is the guard from the v warehouse we torched . Well , he was . I 've been trying to call Jack . No word . You heard from him yet ? No , but Georgie 'looking . How do we know that they 're not out there Right now searching for him ? He acted alone . Everything he ever knew about us ends here . How do you know ? Because I know Anna . We infiltrated a warehouse he was guarding , Blew it up right under his nose . You make a mistake like that , You clean it up before you report back to her . And he figured he would suffer a better fate At my hand than hers ? He was wng . What are you doing ? My son is on that ship . I 'm going to get him back . You can 't just go storming up to the ship , Erica . Ryan , that bastard came into my home and tried to kill me , And now my son is up there with the rest of tm . Don 't tell me what I can 't do . We make the wrong move here , Erica , Your son will have no one to come home to . I 'm trying to help . You want to help ? Lose the body . His mother keeps calling . She 's worried about him . Keep him here till we find what we need . He can only have one family ... Us . Yes , mother . I 'm not saying this again . I need to see my son . All right , I 'm no longer asking . Agent Evans ? I need to see my son . Tyler ? This way , please . Tyler , come on . We 're leaving . Come on . No , mom . I 'm not . Look , I know I was out all night , And I should have called you , And I 'm really sorry , But ... I don 't want to go home , Not right now . Ty , I need you to come home now . Why ? I 'm safe . I 'm-I 'm fine . What , is it because you don 't trust the v 's ? I just don 't understand what your problem is with them . My only problem is that you stayed out all night , And you didn 't call . I was worried . Something could have happened to you . What , you think just because you 're 17 I don 't worry anymore ? Look , I 'm not a kid anymore , and you 've got to stop Treating me like one . Don 'worry . I 'm-I 'm fine . I 'll be home for dinner . Tyler ... Your son is still on board our ship . He refused to come down , So you were speaking to a hologram of him . Don 't worry , Agent Evans . As long as your son is a guest our ship , You have nothing to fear . ♪ V 1x05 ♪ Welcome to the War Original Air date on March 30 , 2010 This is Chad Decker with a " prime focus " special report . An apparent attack on a lyndhurst shipping warehouse Has destroyed most of New York City 's flu vaccines . The FBI has no suspects at this time , But rumors are swirling it may have been a terrorist attack . There are even some anti-v activists Claiming the visitors were involved . We 'll have more details as they become available To us throughout the day . We have nothing to worry about . Our fail-safe incinerated everything inside . There 's nothing left to lead them back to us . Even your mouthpiece chadecker can 't hurt us . I 'll handle him . Where do we stand with our own investigation ? No leads . Our surveillance footage was erased Before the fifth column sent their message And destroyed our warehouse full of r-6 . Find who did this and supply the FBI with a lead . Deliver a villain , and a hero emerges . The resistance is growing . If the fifth column is in our midst , There may be others on ships worldwide . We have to crush them before they become a greater threat . To do that , we need more soldiers-an army . You only brought a few on these ships . The fleet you sent for is still on its way . You 'll get your army . How ? I 'll make one . I need to get on that ship and get my son . You do that , and he 's dead . Anna knows that you 're an FBI Agent . There is no way she 's gonna risk a diplomatic incident By hurting Tyler . There is nothing that we can do about it right now . You need to go to work And stay as close to that warehouse investigation As you can , make sure it doesn 't lead back to us . Any word from Jack ? Georgie 's still looking for him . What are you gonna do ? I 'll take a sample of that r-6 that we got from the warehouse To a v doctor I know , See if we can figure out what 's in that flu vaccine . Find Jack , okay ? No . No ! Please , no . Long time , Dr. Pearlman . Ryan . What are you doing here ? I need your help . What 's this ? R-6 . The v 's are putting tha iinto the human flu vaccine . Thought you 'd help me find out why . That 's not the only reason I 'm here . My girlfriend val ... She 's pregnant . Are you sure ? They told us that we could not procreate with humans . This is the first I 've ever heard of this happening . I ... I guess nature and fate - they find a way . She has this heart condition , though , and I don 't even know If she could handle a regular pregnancy , Let alone something like this . Does she know the truth about you ? I 'm afraid what it 'll do to her-and us ... If she ever found out . Imagine what would happen if Anna ever found out about this . You ... Your girlfriend ... Your child ... Will never be safe . The captains of the 29 ships Are sending their best soldiers to us . They 're to report to you for a full medical examination Before I meet them . As you wish . Where do we stand with the r-6 ? All the doses that we hid in the human flu vaccines Were destroyed by the explosion . There 's still plenty of r-6 in our healing centers . Continue to administer it to the humans there . Many of them are too afraid to go into the healing centers . They don 't trust us yet . Then we 'll get them to trust us . W ? By using somebody they already do . paging Dr. Bedford . Dr. Bedford . Good news , Chad . Your C.T. Scan showed no sign of a basilar artery aneurysm . Well , the v scan says that I 'm going to develop one . All I can tell you is That the most advanced human technology Doesn 't indicate that there 's a problem . Well , what if they 're right ? What if I do develop one ? Well , unfortunately , that type of aneurysm is inoperable . So there wouldn 't be anything we can do for you anyway . So I should let the v 's heal me ? Chad , as a doctor , I can only recommend what I know to be medically possible . And as a friend ? We don 't know the long-term fects Of the visitors healing methods . So you can either trust our medicine or theirs . Excuse me . Yes , can I help you ? Yeah . I 'm looking for father Jack . You 're thinking of joining the parish ? No , not-not exactly . Listen , I-I need to find him . It 's important . I 'm afraid there 's been an accident . Jack was stabbed late last evening . What ? Who ? We don 't know yet , But it 's a miracle he 's alive . Okay . What hospital is he in ? Not a hospital . The v healing center . I took him where I knew he would be saved . any news on the warehouse explosion ? C.S.U. Found nothing . Whatever hit that place burned so hot There was nothing left to analyze . Malik ! What does Malik have to do with the warehouse explosion ? Well , as head of the visitor joint task force , She 's been brought in to the investigation . The visitors offered to assist us . How ? They got an alien k-9 unit we 're not aware of ? Apparently , they have a device that can show us who did this . Agent Evans ? Nice to see you again . I 'm sorry about this morning . So am I. Tyler is doing fine . And with respect to the warehouse , I want to assure you that whoever committed This heinous act - we will catch them . Our technology can measure ordnance fragmentation , Chemical compositionand pro . Together , it calculates and creates a simulation Of the explosion . There 's your expsive - C4 plastic compound , magnesium fuse . 600-foot blast radius . Now that I told you the how , would you like to know the who ? Wow . Those are ... Prints . We got a match . Prints belong to ... Kyle hobbes . Who 's Kyle hobbes ? He 's a mercenary At the head of pretty much every law enforcement agency 's Most wanted list . Yeah . Former british s.A.S. , improvised weapons expert - Guerrilla warfare , black ops . He 's the guy countries would send in to train the rebels When they needed a convenient uprising . That was before he became a gun for hire - Whoever would pay him most . No one 's had anything solid to pin on him till now . If this pans out , it 's a big win for us . I 'll report back to Anna . This will please her greatly to know she 's helped you . All right , listen up , everybody . Hobbes is in New York . Run all informants . Work with known associates lists . We finally got something to pin on this guy . Let 's bring him in . So what 's this guy got do with us ? On paper , we don 't snd a chance against the visitors . We are overpowered , outnumbered and underequipped . Hobbes can train us , teach us how to think . You 're talking about recruiting him for the resistance ? I know how crazy this sounds , Ryan . Belie me . I have spent my entire career ridding the world Of people like hobbes . I am scared . My son is up there on that ship . I am helpless to protect him . Okay , say we do this , right ? How do we even find him ? Dale . Your old partner ? He spent seven years With the FBI counterterrorist division . He was meticulous . They have his hard drive . If there 's any information about hobbes , That is where it will be . You sure about this ? What if he isn 't just some patsy ? What if Anna chose him for a reason ? 'cause he 's dangerous to her . Yeah . He has access to weapons . He could train resistance . That is exactly why we need him . The FBI took the bait . They 're looking for Kyle hobbes . They will no longer be a problem for us . Where are we with finding the fifth column Who are truly responsible ? Our people are looking into it . We will find them . Good . And then I 'll eviscerate them . If we cross this line , Erica , And we get into bed with a guy like hobbes , There is no turning back . She has my son . If I have to cross a line to blow that bitch out of the sky , I will . That 's fugu - Japanese blowfish . I know . It has a deadly poison in its liver . If not cut properly , it means instant death . Maybe that 's what makes it so delicious . Try it . Wow . It 's amazing . Sit . Enjoy . Thanks for joining me . I saw your piece on the warehouse explosion . Why did you mention rumors of my people being involved ? Because they 're part of the story . I was doing my job . I am a reporter . Mm . And yet you haven 't aired your story on our healing centers . It 's very important to me ... And so are you . I know about the aneurysm , Chad . I also know you haven 't signed up for treatment with us , And I 'm concerned . Thank you , but I feel fine . That 's today . What about tomorrow ? I 'm not sure I believe you can diagnose the future . This is real . Why won 't you let me help you ? Maybe because you always want something from me . And you don 't want something from me ? Run the piece on the healing centers . And what if I don 't ? I can only imagine how scary it must be Living in fear of sudden death ... And helpless to do anything about it . Mmm . It is delicious . Jack . Welcome back . It 's okay . You 're healed . No . No . There 's - something 's wrong with me . They injected me with r-6 . I can ... I can feel it inside me . No . No ! aah ! Jack , it 's okay . It 's me . Georgie ? How 'd you find me ? Father Travis said he brought you here for your own good . Where 's everyone else ? I 'll explain later . Now get dressed . We need to get out of here . Evans . You find anything on hobbes ? You 'll be the first to know . Great . Hey , Kyle . What are you smiling about ? That she didn 't come alone . Who are you ? Your only chance for a future . How 'd you find me ? My old partner kept files on people like you . He also didn 't like to share them with the FBI . Well , who 'd he share them with ? The same people who set you up . Set me up ? How ? Your prints - On the bomb that torched the lyndhurst warehouse . if I had anything to do with that , They wouldn 't have my prints . And since I didn 't , they don 't . They do . Prove it , or the three of us get to play " who 's got the best aim ? " Trust me , not a game you want to play . Kendrick . Paul , it 's Erica . I 'm following up a lead from Dale 's hard drive - A tip on the location for hobbes . 40 ellridge . He 's there right now . On my way . I 'll meet you there . any minute now , the FBI s.W.A.T. Team Will come through that door . You can either come with us Or leave with them . Make up your mind . We only came here for help . My kind of help costs , And you 're living on a fed 's salary . That sounds like a raw deal for me . We can get you money . We can also t you something more valuable . What ? The people who framed you . Aren 't you curious ? You have one minute . Your choice . Where is he ? We just missed him . Cigar 's still lit . There 's another door . Escape route . Where 's hobbes ? Gone . Somebody tipped him off . Did you find what we 're looking for ? There 's just so much . What does it all mean ? They don 't seem to serve any purpose . Human memories contain emotion , not just information . That 's why they n be difficult to interpret . Why aren 't our memories like that ? Our species is designed for efficiency . We 're not burdened by emotional imprints like humans . We have what we need . Tyler must calm her fears , loosen her bond on him . And he will be free from her . And you , my daughter , Will be free to fulfill your destiny . That was amazing . We call it a memory chamber . But it felt like I was really there . We tapped into your cerebral cortex , Allowing you to relive your memories in vivid detail . It affected you . I saw my family , a long time ago . You know what I saw ? I saw a mother afraid of losing her son . Go home . Tell her it 's okay to let you go , Not to be afraid . You 're becoming a man , starting your own life . That doesn 't mean she 'll lose you like she did your father . You 're becoming a man , Erica.Ting your own life . Hey . You okay ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Thank you , Georgie . This is hobbes . He 's ex-military , gun for hire , weapons expert . He can get us weapons . He can teach us to fight . Is he a terrorist ? He 's only loyal to money . that makes him predictable . Yeah , and if someone comes along and pays him more than we do ? Anna is fighting dirty . If we want to win this war , We can 't bring knives to a gunfight . You 're forgetting one thing . I haven 't said yes yet . Have you looked in the sky lately ? They 're here to annihilate us . Unless you got deep pockets , I 'm not interested in your cause . This isn 't just a cause for us . It 's his way of life . It 's my faith . Revenge for a family slaughtered , Her son . We all have a stake in this . Don 't think you don 't . Go ahead and walk away . We still have your prints on that bomb . And you 're trying to hire me , a known fugitive , To do your bidding . Yeah . You have as much to lose now as I do . So last time-show me the money or show me the door . You 're right . Like it or not , we 're all in this together now . So how about I show you the truth ? The v 's are nothing but lies . They look like you . They sound like you . But we are not like you . So you 're telling me ... Yeah . I 'm one of them . But I am not with them . And they 're the ones that framed you . Aren 't you the least bit pissed off and curious why ? yeah . Welcome to the war . hey , mom . It 's ty . On my way home from the ship now . I 'll , uh , see you at dinner . Okay . Bye . Hey . Georgie told me what happened . I got the guy who stabbed you . He 's a pair of lizd skin boots now . How 's Tyler ? Okay . He 's coming home for dinner . That 's-that 's good . How are you ? I 'm-I 'm fine . You lying to me , father ? I feel like something 's changed inside me . We 're all changing . I just made a deal ... With the devil . I broke every oath that I have sworn to protect . I don 't know what I 'm thinking . You 're thinking about protecting your son , The ones you love . Hey . It 's good to see a friend . me , too . so what did you find out ? Examination of the r-6 using human technology Revealed nothing more than a simple saline shot . But when I used our equipment , I found something quite different . R-6 has a molecular mpound That embeds itself in human d.N.A. It interacts with the human genome , Then emits a wavelength of sorts , like a transmission . So she 's tagging humans like animals in the wild . You tell anybody about this ? No . And neither should you . Not until we know the truth . How are the candidates For the next phase of the r-6 plan looking ? I think she 'll be pleased . I 'm Chad Decker , reporting live From the Manhattan visitor healing center . Miracle cures ? Wonder drugs ? Tonight " prime focus " takes you inside the v healing centers , Where science fiction is becoming science fact For those in need , For those like me . During my visit here for this report , The v doctors diagnosed me with a lethal Brian aneurysm . They 're telling me they have a cure , And I 'm gonna take it . " prime focus " will take its cameras behind the curtains As I am healed by the visitor doctors , Giving all of you a firsthand look at their miracle cures . What is it ? Mr. Decker just made sure we 'd take very good care of him . Kyle hobbes escaped the FBI . We suspect he was tipped off . Fifth column ? Perhaps . He can help them build an army against us . It 's time to build our own . You have been selected from the best among the 29 ships . Our army will begin with one of you . The very survival of our species will depend on one of you . Your queen commands it . Him . Mom ? Hey . Thank God you 're home . Are you okay ? Yeah . Are you ? Do you have any idea what you put me through today ? Yes . And I 'm-I 'm sorry . But ... I - I need to tell you something . I - Just-just listen to me for once , mom . Okay . You 're not gonna lose me . I 'm not dad . I am always gonna be here for you . Just because I 'm grown up ... It doesn 't mean we gotta grow apart . How can I expect you to understand my choices If I can 't be completely honest with you ? About what ? The visitors . Tyler , I need to talk to you about the visitors . No . There 's something I have to tell you . Mom , listen . It 's very , very - I - I joined the peace ambassadors . You don 't have to be afraid of the v 's anymore . I 'm not afraid of the visitors , ty . I 'm just afraid of losing you . You won 't . Trust me . I do trust you . No more secrets about the visitors , okay ? Don 't worry . Mom , the visitors - they don 't have any secrets . Ugh . Ugh . val ? Val ? Everything okay ? Something 's not right . What do you mean ? I - I 've been eating nonstop all day long , And I 've had weird cravings . Something 's not right . I never told you this , but I always wanted kids . And then I met you , And you told me that it wasn 't a possibility for you . And then I realized that if there was anything in the world That I wanted more than being a mom , it was to be with you . Val - It 's a miracle , this baby , Ryan.Sh. It happened for a reason . I know it did . It 's done . My army is to be born . Now my eggs need nourishment .

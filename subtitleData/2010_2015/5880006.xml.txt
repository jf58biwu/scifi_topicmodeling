 The two hottest guys ever walk into that bar , And they want to hang out with us . But , no , someone has to go back to the dorm . Yeah , well , excuse me if I don 't want to slut it up . Excuse me if I do . Oh , look at those eyes . He smokes . So ? So , yuck . He better call me , or I 'm gonna kill you . Hmm . Power must be out . Do you smell cigarette smoke ? Aah ! No . No ! Don 't make a sound . Hopes of securing an extension Of unemployment benefits for 1.3 million ... Good morning . I got to get out of here . The speaker called . He wants a quick meet before committee . Although there is still a chance That the program will resume , The earliest that congress will revisit the legislation Is at the end of next January . Thank you . What 's that ? No idea . Thomas , what is this ? Oh , dear god . Lillian , weatherly 's here . I know . He 's with ... I know who he 's with . Gentlemen . I cued the video for you . I 'm told you have a sensitive situation . Is there any other kind ? Late night . Kennedy center . Yo-yo ma . Saudi royals . I heard you brought a video . She 's a college student at the university of Arizona . The girl on the left is Mackenzie Bradshaw , Daughter of Tom Bradshaw , senior senator from Arizona , Chairman of the foreign-relations committee . The satellite is the GEO-9 That we 're selling to México , right ? Is counting on it to provide border security , If the senate foreign-relations committee votes " yea . " That vote is the day after tomorrow . So , someone is blackmailing a U.S. senator To keep the satellite deal from going through . Not just any someone ... Hector Villareal . He 's the head of the biggest drug cartel in México . He stands to lose hundreds of millions If the satellite deal goes through . And why target Bradshaw ? Bradshaw chairs the committee . He can withdraw the proposal . If you want the satellite to go away , Bradshaw 's the one you go after . So , why bring this to Cybercom ? The senator didn 't bring it to Cybercom . He didn 't bring it to anyone . The senator and his wife watched the video together , And afterwards , he went to the Capitol building As if nothing had happened . They don 't know that you have the video . Mnh-mnh . Would you care to explain Why it is that you 're in possession of it ? No , I wouldn 't . What exactly is your job these days ? Friend of the court . Look , this thing has to be done right , rooster , Without grandstanding , without politics . I 'll wait in the hall . I told you to never call me that . I am the director of U.S. Cyber command , And you 'll afford me the respect I deserve . If I didn 't respect you , would I be here ? You are so damn relentless . Do you know that ? You get that from me , I guess . Lillian , if it goes public That the daughter of a U.S. senator Was snatched by a Mexican drug cartel you 've already cleared this with the president , haven 't you ? The president recommended clockwork . Lillian , we have to find these girls . Okay . One of our nation 's most decorated soldiers . He 's a hero , and now our country 's most secret weapon . Gabriel possesses a rare genetic mutation That allowed us to implant a microchip in his brain . We connected his mind directly to the information grid . It 's something the chip does that nobody expected . I can create a virtual snapshot of an event in my mind And then walk through it . It 's like a virtual evidence wall . We created a highly specialized unit around him ... Satellite in five . And assigned an agent to protect him . Run ! He 's the first of his kind ... The next evolution of intelligence . Hector Villareal is on the u.N. ' s most wanted list And yet has remained virtually untouchable . The new Mexican president And his relationship to our president Is changing that , and Hector is worried . Son of a shop owner in San Miguel de Allende , Hector sits on a multi-billion-dollar High-tech drug empire . His network uses everything From mules to submarines to ship his product . So , why kidnap the daughter of a U.S. senator ? In less than 48 hours , senator Bradshaw 's committee Will vote to recommend the sale Of the GEO-9 satellite system to México . Bradshaw could kill the sale if he wanted to . Our military believes that this satellite It could cripple the illegal-narcotics trade . Apparently , Hector agrees . If Bradshaw won 't withdraw the proposal , Can 't the president just postpone the vote ? Better yet , why not send in a special-forces unit ? Well , the first option would result in Hector Killing the girls . Without knowing where he 's holding them ... And also risks their lives . Who 's sitting with the senator on this ? FBI ? The senator doesn 't even know that we 're on problem . And their biggest problems were boys and midterms . Now it 's Hector Villareal . Now Hector 's about to meet his biggest problem . Start in Arizona . See what you can learn at the scene . Let 's find those girls and show the cartel what happens When you cross our border and harm our kids . On our way . What 's with Big Ben ? Like it ? Accurate to the hundredth of a second . Four seconds slow . I chipped the maritime clock . Show-off . Getting nostalgic ? If I knew I 'd have a chip in my brain , I could have avoided all that studying . I 'm sure there was a lot of studying . 3.8 GPA plus three sports Didn 't leave a lot of time to eat . Mm-hmm . I guess there 's always room for dessert . It 's eerie being the first on scene . If the senator reported it , it would be all over the news . We 've got maybe 24 hours before their dorm mates Notice they 're missing . Let 's see if they left something . Gabriel . Belongs to Samantha Royce . I 'm in her Instagram account . Photo taken 15 minutes before witnesses said The girls left the bar . Shows Samantha with a guy . Can we find out who ? His passport was recorded by customs this morning As it crossed the border into San Jerónimo , México . He was driving a truck . What are the odds Samantha and Mackenzie were hidden on that truck ? ? Habla inglés ? Sí , yes . We 're looking for your son ... Carlos . I haven 't seen him in many days . Senora reyes , we 're trying to help your son . Carlos is a good boy . We don 't want to make any more trouble for you . What trouble could you cause more ... More than the trouble that they can ? Um ... This is my cellphone number . I want you to have Carlos call me . I told you I have not seen him . Just in case . If you help us , we can protect you . We can give you asylum in the United States . Please , I ... I would like you both to leave now . I got a cell number off her phone bill . Can you chip the phone ? I did . Which means I can 't trace it until they make a call . We 've got eyes on us . You didn 't touch these girls , right ? No , jefe . Is he lying to me ? No . These girls don 't need a gag . Do you ? No . Good . Hopefully your father is as smart as you . Please help my friend . She needs water . You , come with me . And bring that one . - Oh , no . - No . No . No , take me instead . No , take me ! No , take me instead ! Take me ! I 'll go . I ... Hey ... Don 't make me sorry I took the gag out . Okay , pretty girl ? Okay ? Okay . Lillian still hasn 't made contact with senator Bradshaw . Why not ? They 've ordered her not to . Maybe they don 't want the senator to know His own government 's watching him . Gabriel . That 's the number I got off Luisa 's phone bill . That 's Carlos . Answer it . Hola . Hello . Hello ? Is anyone there ? Nothing , but the line 's still open . I 've got a cell signal . He hung up . It 's okay . I 'm in the cell network . We 're 1.3 miles away from the phone that made that call . This feels super safe . Cellphone signal 's coming from inside the trunk . No . Hang on , Gabriel . Trunk 's open . I said stay back . If that cellphone is connected to an explosive ... Good point . I have an idea . What are you doing ? Trunk has a hydraulic spring-load . Oh , god . Hola , Carlos . They 're taunting us . They must have talked to Carlos ' mother . They knew we 'd track the cellphone here . Hector 's a cool customer . Oh , god . Really ? Someone wants to say hello . I don 't want to be rude . This what you were looking for ? Hector Villareal , I presume ? The senator violated our agreement . He wasn 't supposed to call the authorities . He didn 't have to . You 're not as smooth as you think you are . Open the laptop . Don 't worry . Open it . Careful . Have you heard of the Mexican jumping bean ? Hector , you don 't want to do this . What is a Mexican jumping bean ? Pull the pin from the grenade . When she loses consciousness , the grenade falls . You must have spent some time in Ciudad de México , my friend . As you can see , this poor girl is not doing very well . I give her ... Five minutes longer ? Then you can call her parents And tell her you watched her die . Oh , by the way , tell Obregon It didn 't have to be like this . Who 's Obregon ? I 've got a signal on the laptop . Lillian , they 're gonna kill Samantha . I have a lock on the location . There was something else . He mentioned someone named Obregon . As far as I know , This is a new name in all of this , right ? Yes , it is . Skycom 1 . You should be able to access it right now . I don 't see any bogeys . Two-room house . She 's in the front room . Doesn 't seem like anyone 's in the back . I don 't like it . We could stay out here , and that girl dies . You 're okay . You 're okay . You all right ? Yeah . I came as soon as I heard . You got Samantha . Well done . What about the Bradshaw girl ? Not yet . We have less than 30 hours . Yes , I 'm aware of that . Can Samantha help us at all ? Dad ... Hector mentioned someone named Obregon . Any idea who that is ? No . Well , we did some searching To see if there was something in our system ... Operation names , agents ' aliases , et cetera . And ? Nothing . But then I got to thinking , Maybe he was referring to the famous Obregón , The Mexican president in the 1920s . Go on . Obregón and Pancho Villa Were fierce enemies during the revolution . Pancho became a folk hero , Forcing Obregón to make an uncomfortable peace with him . But Pancho was paranoid , Always waiting for Obregón 's men to assassinate him . Paranoid , but correct ... Which goes to prove what I always told you ... Peace is beautiful , but ... but not to be trusted . You remember . I remember everything you taught me , dad , Including the story of the Mexican revolution . You 're Obregon , aren 't you ? And Hector is Pancho Villa , the misunderstood folk hero . You know each other . I miss you , kid . When were you going to tell me That Hector Villareal is on the payroll Of the U.S. Government ? I want all cards face up right now . Hector was our " Whitey " Bulger . The FBI fed Bulger to help them bring down the mafia . But he was supposed to operate within certain parameters , And Whitey strayed outside those parameters . And an FBI agent is sitting in prison now for that deal . Hector gave us the names , All the intel on his competitors , People far worse than him . In return , we laid off him . Vintage Leland Strand . Lillian , we seized thousands of tons of cocaine Based on Hector 's intel . We brought down some real monsters crossing the border . How did you get that video ? Were you surveilling the senator or Hector ? Well , we knew Hector was unhappy with the GEO-9 . He had made some threats . So , prophylactically , we got the NSA to monitor All comint into and out of the committee . We didn 't anticipate the kidnapping . That was bold , even for Hector . You adopted a lion cub , fed it raw meat , When it grew up liking the taste of blood . What do you want me to do ? He 's your asset . Control him . Lives are at stake . I know . Get a leash on your lion , dad . Hakuna matata . Senator ? Senator ? Senator ? Um , looking , uh , at the numbers and ... And what it 's gonna take to support those numbers , I just don 't see how we 're gonna push this thing Across the finish line . Are you talking about Postponing the satellite sale to México ? Thank you very much . Tom , we all spent half a million On your re-election campaign Because you assured us of this sale . Sir , your daughter 's on the phone . Excuse me . Baby ? Not your baby . What do you want ? Question for you ... Why are two U.S. Intelligence officers In México looking for your daughter ? I-I-I don 't know . I had nothing to do with it , though . Is Mackenzie okay ? You were warned , senator . You gave me your word . And if a man can 't trust a politician ... My word is still good . I didn 't have anything to do with them . I swear to god they 're not mine . Men like us don 't believe in god , Not after the things we 've seen . I believe there is a god , sir . You 'd better hope you 're right , senator . If you fail to honor our agreement ... I cannot guarantee your daughter 's safety . I just want my daughter back . I 'll stall the legislation . That the satellite transfer to México doesn 't go through . We shall see . How is she ? She 's stabilized . Good . I don 't get it . How does Lillian 's father fit into all of this ? Not sure . I saw him at the white house a lot When I was on presidential detail . I never really knew what he did . Imagine growing up with that guy , Worried the tooth fairy 's gonna slit your throat . He did something right . She 's incredibly driven . Or still seeking his approval . That stuff 's hard to shake . That 's why everyone in my family Ended up dying on some dusty battlefield somewhere . I 'm the fifth Vaughn to go to war , First one to survive it . My old man was a folded flag on the mantel . It 's some country song nobody wants to hear . Is there a country song anyone wants to hear ? We 'll talk about that later . Samantha . Where 's Mackenzie ? We 're gonna find her ... With your help . About the place they were holding you ? Even the tiniest detail might help . The room was s-small , And you had to go down some stairs to get to it . There were three , maybe four men . They had the tv on all the time . Do you know what they were watching ? There was cheering on the tv , and they would cheer , But it was in Spanish . Soccer . They were watching soccer . Soccer . That 's good . Anything else ? It s-sounds crazy , but ... Outside , it sounded like animals . Animals ? Like a jungle ... lions , elephants . You 've been very helpful . Get some rest . Lions and elephants ? I know . Hang on . I 'm chipping the local cable company , Isolating subscribers of the soccer channel . Wow . Apparently México loves soccer . I 'm getting thousands of hits . Is there a zoo or something , an animal sanctuary ? Not anywhere close . How are we gonna find this girl ? Wish I knew . Bueno . Hola , Hector . ? qué tal , jefe ? I had a feeling I might hear from you . What do you want , Leland ? I 'm calling to give you some business advice . Do I look like I need your advice ? Do you remember when we played golf with Noriega ? You are comparing me to that monkey ? Hector , Noriega was the president Of an actual nation . And when he pissed us off , We sent 25,000 troops in to arrest him . The game has changed . Creo que no . The only thing that changed the game Was you kidnapping two American girls . I delivered monsters to you on a silver platter , Made you look good , and what do you do in return ? You put an eye in the sky to shut down my business . You broke your word to me , cabrón ! That was not me . It was others , Hector . And I 'm prepared to make you an offer . Killing the satellite deal Is the only offer I am interested in . The satellite is going through . Then we have nothing to talk about , hermano . But I 'm prepared to give you the codes . You have my attention . You 'll have access to the satellite At any given time and the intel it gathers . The codes for the girl , Hector , And your word that nothing like this can ever happen again . I am not stupid . I take the deal , you will simply change the codes . Take the deal , hermano . It 's the best you 're gonna get . We have a deal . Deal ? What deal ? You 're not gonna like it any more than I do , But we 're getting Mackenzie out of there . I 'm sending the location of the drop point To your navigator . We 're gonna do this . We 're gonna bring that girl home . Do you see them ? No , not yet . I don 't like this . You should be up here . I should be down there . We talked about this . You 're a better shot with that rifle than I am . And you 're following my orders . Okay , here we go , guys . We 're entering from the southwest . Just get the girl , put her in the car , Unless he asks me to dance , in which case I 'm gonna break out my cha-cha . Stay focused . I vote for the cha-cha . Riley . Just one of you bring the girl ! Sólo uno ! I have a bad feeling about this . Sólo uno ! Riley , take a few steps back . Wait . Sólo uno . Wait . Where are you going ? Sólo uno . Wait . Where are you going ? Hey , Gabriel , at the SUV Wait ! No ! Riley , get out of there ! Lillian . Riley , pull back now . Wait . You 're coming with us . Drop the gun ... Gabriel , do you have a shot ? No . Do you want her to die ? ! Riley , go now ! Poner la pistola or I kill her ! Riley , go ! Riley , get out of there ! You want her dead ? I 'll kill her ! Riley , pull back now . I can 't . I can 't leave her . Damn it ! And slow . No . No ! Gabriel . I don 't have a shot . No ! No ! No ! I 'm a federal agent . We 're here to get you home . Are you okay ? I-I don 't understand . We were double-crossed . Wait . They took Samantha . And I don 't know where she is . No , we have Samantha . She 's safe . They 're gonna kill us . Mackenzie . They ... they 're gonna kill us . Mackenzie , look at me . Look at me . We have to rely on each other , okay ? That 's how we 're gonna get out of here . Do you understand ? Mackenzie ? Mackenzie , do you understand ? Okay ? Okay . We can do this . Okay . Consider this a clear message . I am no longer taking orders from you . But I am not an animal . Take the GEO-9 satellite off the table , And I will receive this as goodwill Towards our new relationship . Then you can have the young ladies back , hmm ? I want an analysis on that video right away . These guys are pros . This is gonna take some time . Until we find something we can use . You don 't have to . I 've got enough from that video to cyber-render . This is the cyber-render . I 'm in . I see Riley and Mackenzie . They 've been roughed up , but ... I think they 're okay . The watch . Watch ? What watch ? She had it on in the SUV , Only she was wearing it on the other wrist . It 's stopped . Wouldn 't that make sense in a render ? She stopped it . 23 minutes after the drop . 23 minutes . She 's telling us how long she drove after the ambush . The second dial ... she set it at 12 : 15 . 12 : 15 . That 's due east . She 's guiding us right to her . Okay , I 'm in the Mexican telecable database . There 's a house in the area That has a recent acquisition Of an expensive international sports package . Let me guess ... soccer . You got it . I 'm bringing up satellite images on the position . Got it . I have a location . Hang on . I 'm coming to get you . Elephant burgers . Found our jungle . He goes in alone ? I 'm in their cams . Ramon 's inside , three guards . Riley and Mackenzie must be in the basement . I 'm going to trigger their security alarm . There 's a storm door , far end of the house . It must lead to the basement . You sure took your time . Couldn 't decide what to wear . Nice trick with the watch . You 're jealous now , aren 't you ? You all right ? Yeah . Gabriel , right behind you . It 's Hector Villareal . Gabriel , you 're not authorized to take Hector in . Stand down and let him go . What are you talking about ? I 've got him in my sights . What are you talking about ? We have the girl . Your agent is safe . Hector Villareal is not your concern . There are lots of killers in the world , Lillian . Many of them are at our Washington galas . Secure the girl and stand down , Gabriel . Son of a bitch . Daddy ! Kenzie . I 'm so sorry . I never meant for any of this . We know , baby . We know . We are forever grateful . Today an historic piece of legislation Passed in the senate intelligence committee , Forging a new chapter in the cooperation Between the United States and the Mexican government Involving border security . Senator Tom Bradshaw , the legislation 's sponsor , Didn 't stop to answer ... We should be taking Hector down . It 's not your call . If we had to stop working with murderers And drug dealers and despots , We 'd never get anything accomplished . After all he 's done , you 're still protecting him . You have any idea what it took To order my agent to stand down ? For the greater good , Lillian . According to who ? You know , when I first got to langley , The director said to me , " you think you know what evil 's out there . You have no idea . " Did he tell you to get into bed with that evil ? It 's not a perfect world . But we can make it better . A great man taught me that . The house is a mess . What are you talking about ? It 's spotless . Well , it finally feels like home . You were worried about me . No , I wasn 't . If you say so . Well , you look pretty good For a girl who 's been through the wringer . Now , that sounds like a country song . Good night , Gabriel . Hector ? How did you get this number ? I believe you know my father . You 're Lillian , leland 's daughter . I 've heard a lot about you . You haven 't heard everything . Congratulations . You won this one . That 's very gracious of you . However , this satellite business Will make peace between us very difficult . You should have taken my father 's offer . You crossed the line , Hector . Oh , yeah ? What line is that ? The border . If your government wants to do business with me , You 'll give me what I want . Or you can find yourself another Mexican . Yes , well , I already have . What ? What are you talking about ? Everything all right ? Better . Shall we ? There 's no place I 'd rather be . Subtitles edited by TheDoktoR

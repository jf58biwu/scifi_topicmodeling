 Hey , hey , Tuck , dude . - Okay , we 're rolling . - Okay , hold on . Before you go , look-look at my coat . - It 's cool , huh ? - What is that ? Can we do another take with it on , though ? No . Okay . ( CLEARS THROAT ) TUCK : Ready when you are . ( SNIFFS ) Okay . How do I smell ? Or I mean , look , or you know ? Yeah , you can 't smell a video . Okay . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Ruckus , dude , you got to get out of here . ( BARKS ) Hi , I 'm Reginald . I don 't really get friends much , but it 's probably because I 'm a bit of ... an acquired taste . That 's what my mom says . And I 'm sure whatever school I 'm forced to go to no one will acquire it . So ... thanks for paving a road over , really , the only place I 've ever had any real friends . Okay . We good ? TUCK : - Uh , say your name . - I thought you knew my name . You know what I mean ; for the video . Dude , we 've been hanging out for years . - Come on . - Dude , stop fronting . Just tell the camera . You 're upset , right ? You don 't want to move . TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) I 've never gone a day without seeing my friends . They 're , like , the only people in the world who get me . And now it 's just all over , you know ? Good luck finding that again . So wherever Munch is going , man ... Look , you people listen to me , all right ? He 's a really good kid . So don 't just assume that he 's weird and that 's it . And Alex , man ... He 's a foster kid . He 's been moved all over . I mean , it 's like , why do you have to build a freeway right through ? You know , can 't you just go around or something ? You 're going along feeling like your own person with your own friends , and then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop because you 're just a kid . ( SCOFFS ) You 're just a kid . ( PHONE RINGS ) Yeah , hey , man . ( SNIFFS ) Yeah , yeah , I 'm up , I 'm up . Whoa , whoa , man , slow down . What 's the problem ? Yeah , my phone 's good . Why ? What happened ? Wait , what ? ( CLICK ) ( VOICE-OVER ) This is when everything started to change . So , being me , I kept filming . I 'm Tuck . What you 're about to see happened to me and my best friends one year ago . This is the story of our last week together . ( STATIC BUZZES , CRACKLES ) Phones all over our neighborhood are freaking out . We 've done everything we could possibly do with this phone . We threw it at the wall , we took it to the phone guy , we took it to the store where we got it from , and they say it 's a problem . So you know it 's serious . It looks like your phone basically barfed on the screen . - What happened ? - I don 't know . I was just eating dinner , and all of a sudden , all the phones in the house just did this . At exactly the same time . Dude . What ? It 's freaky . ( PHONE RINGS ) - De hello ? - Hey , Alex . Oh , Munch , you 're outside . MUNCH : Get over here , over here , down the street . TUCK : Ask him if his phone barfed yet . ALEX : Did your phone barf yet ? - Phones are still working . ALEX : - Cool . Keep going , and we 'll meet you in the backyard . Okay , copy that . I 'll take swift steps . TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) When I look back at that day , I realize the clues were all around us . ( CHUCKLES ) We had no idea . Dude , they all still work . See ? ( PANTING ) Dude , you know if this whole thing works , - these phones are done . - No , I know . I have 14 spares ; it 's okay . ( PHONE CHIRPS ) ( SCOFFS ) I bet you do . Okay . All right , anyways , let 's spread out . - Okay . - Alex , go by the gate . Munch , go on the far end , - Yeah , I got it , and I 'll stay right here by my camera . - Just watch out ! - Okay , okay . Okay , it 's good . It 's good ... It 's good ... ( STATIC SCREECHING ) Whoa , okay , it went out . TUCK : Whoa , whoa , it barfed ! All right , people , if you go to Alex 's house , your phones will spew chunks all over his screen . My mom said the Murphys ' phones and the Churleys ' changed , too . So what do you think this is ? TUCK : Whoa ! ( TUCK CHUCKLES ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) ( TUCK GROANS ) These dudes . ( LOW , INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) Hi . - Is that on ? - I don 't know . - Maybe . - Oh . We had an electrical short over at the site , and it may be disrupting people 's phone service , and we 're wondering if that happened - to anybody in this house ? - Oh , no , my phone is good . - ' Cause we 're offering new phone vouchers - Uh-huh . In exchange for any device in this area here - that may be displaying - That 's weird , that 's weird . - Faulty messages or images ? - I don 't know . See you . No , listen , I ... Okay , so you-you really don 't think this is a little bit weird ? These dudes come here to build a freeway - and now they want our phones ? - Well , I think it 's gonna work . No . Clean your room . Oh , my ... I 'm not gonna have a room if we don 't do something . - Right , I think ... - No , Mom , seriously . These guys want our houses . Maybe if we expose them for illegal property , then ... TUCK : - Yo ! - Aw , you don 't like how things are , do you ? What are you gonna do about it , huh ? ( ELECTRONIC CHIME ) Dude , it 's a map to the desert . Like , what is that ? What do we do with this ? I guess most maps are made to be followed . Exactly . It could go to , like , some crazy headquarters , and we find out that these construction clowns are spies and we expose them to the world . It 's 20 miles away . What ... No , we 're not ... we 're not gonna go . No , obviously not . Look , whatever it is , this Saturday , we 're going to sneak behind our parents ' backs and find out . I 'm moving Saturday . All right , all right , so Friday night . Our last night together ? It doesn 't have to be ; that 's what I 'm saying . Like , I don 't want to move , and these clowns are making us do it . Maybe we can stop them . Now , are you in ? Yeah , all right . - All right . - I 'm in . Munch , don 't you bail out on us now . Dude , I 'm not . Me ? No ... pfft ! I 'm in . Yeah ! All right ! That 's what I 'm talking about , that 's what I 'm talking about , all right . Bring it in . - Oh , oops ! - Munch ! So , why would you be organizing your ketchups ? - Because . - Who does that ? So I can get to them easier , and then it 's more organized , - and it 's better . - And you are my friend . Guys , guys , it 's time to practice the big lie . Hey , Mom , I 'm spending the night at Alex 's house so we can play a neat , brand-new video game . And I 'm sleeping over at Tuck 's house so we can play a new video game . And I 'm sleeping in your mom 's bed , - not playing a video game . - Oh , my God , all right , dude . Stop talking about my mother , thank you . All right , the camera 's are gonna be on 24 hours a day , nonstop . Dude , can you stop touching , please ? It attaches to my bike , and it 's also a pretty good way to get footage on the fly . Spy glasses . I love these ; I love them . And last , camera , but definitely not least ... What up , camcorder ? Keeping it tight . Looking pretty good these days . Tuck , these are the ugliest things I 've ever seen . Dude , what ? What are you ... what are you talking about ? Those are ... They 're sweet . - The camera 's undetectable , - Wow . - And the ladies love them . - Prove it . Prove it ? ( SCOFFS ) This guy , all right ? Give me my glasses , man . Those are stealth . Now I 'm gonna prove to you guys spy glasses get you girls . MUNCH : Oh , my gosh , he 's going over there . - I can 't see who he 's talking to . - Shut up , Munch . TUCK : Uh , hi , uh ... Hey , um , Em-Emma , right ? Emma ? I was just ... ( TUCK SPUTTERS ) Okay , uh , can I borrow a piece of paper , please ? MUNCH : He has something . - I can 't see who he got it from . - We 're about to see right now . Look , look , look , look . He has a paper . ALEX : You did not get her number . Totally got her number . Right there . You doubted me , and my spy glasses worked . You , too , you 're a sellout . No , uh-uh , you didn 't get Emma 's number . Yes , I did . Mannequin Girl ? ( ALEX LAUGHS ) What kind of name is that ? What ? That 's what I call her . I think mannequins are hot . ( SCHOOL BELL RINGING ) TUCK : I 'll leave my house at 6 : 00 . 15 minutes later , I pick up Alex . - Munch , we 'll get you at 6 : 30 . - Yeah . Okay ? Tonight , we 're no longer boys . We 're men . ( GRUNTS ) TUCK : - Dude , what the ... ? - I didn 't see you , man . ( TUCK SIGHS ) ALEX : Tuck , you all right ? Let 's go . TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) Our whole lives we 've been nobodies . In visible . The good kids . ( CHUCKLES ) Not anymore . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) All right , Ma . I 'm leaving . Spending the night at Alex 's house so we can play a new video game . Have whatever you want , honey . ( CONVERSATION CONTINUES ) ( TUCK SIGHS ) You know what , I lied , actually . We 're gonna ride our bikes out into the desert at night alone . Without supervision . We got that ; we 're going to state . Okay , see you then , sweetie . - We could go . - Also rob a bank . - All the way . State . - What ? TUCK : Go to Mexico . Maybe even start a new life . - Right , I know . - Wrestling ! TUCK 'S MOM : You 're trying to act like I don 't know what I 'm talking about . ( CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER CONTINUE ) What 's up , Stumpy ? Yo , man , I told you to stop to calling me that . You know what , man , look , my girl 's throwing this huge party later tonight , if you want to come by . ( ENGINE STARTS ) You serious ? Yes , I 'm serious . Because not a lady in the world can resist a natty old BMX bike . What 's the zero to 60 on that bad boy , huh ? Two , three days ? ( TIRES SQUEALING , ENGINE RUMBLING ) ( HUMMING ) Come on , come on , dude , you ready ? Let 's go . ( LAUGHS ) I can 't even tell a difference . This looks exactly the way it looked before you packed . All your stuff fitting in one box ? What are you , a drifter ? Who told you ? Look , all I 'm saying is , when you get to your new house , put a poster up , put some shelves on the wall , frame a photo . Look , there 's a painting right there . Put something on a shelf ... That 's not a painting . That looks like somebody just took a bunch of dirt , smudged it and called it art . I 'm going to Munch 's house to play a video game , all right ? - Okay . - Yeah , sure , buddy . - Bye , Dylan . - Have fun with your friends . - Hey , hey , Tuck . TUCK : - How are you ? Uh , good luck with the move to New York , buddy . - Maybe we 'll come see you . - All right , cool . The moving truck is coming at 10 : 00 . Make sure you 're back , okay ? TUCK : I don 't get it . If your foster parents already have a baby of their own , why do they need you ? There 's no sense in having two babies . - Shut up , dude . - One baby cries all the time , the other one listens to indie rock . Let 's go . ( ALEX WHOOPING ) ( TUCK HUMMING ) ALEX : Yeow ! WOMAN : Guys , would you please help my son with his room , before I go crazy ? - Yeah , yeah , sure . - I don 't think he 's started ... Honey , have you even started packing your room ? MUNCH : I told you a thousand times , I 'm alphabetizing ! ( ALEX CHUCKLES ) TUCK : Yo , let 's scare him , let 's scare him . Shh . ( DOOR CREAKS ) ( VIDEO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY ) MAN : ( ON VIDEO ) ... they 're flexible , they 're " dynamical , " they can be curved , they can bend , and this opens up a whole new universe of possibilities , and one of the possibilities is that there can be shortcuts through space and through time . So that 's really just what a Wormhole is . It 's taking advantage ... ( BOYS WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ) ( SCREAMING ) What are you ... Aah ! - Why don 't you stop doing that ? ! - I 'm sorry ! You guys are gonna give me a heart attack one day . - I 'm sorry . - Turn that off , dude . ( MUTTERING ) ( BEEPING ) I created a substation for each of our parents ' phones that 's wired to the router , which is wired to the transmitter , which transmits to the receiver , which is ... - my phone . TUCK : - Okay , so basically , no matter who our parents call , it goes to your phone . Yeah . My mom 's friends always say that I sound just like my mom , you know , - when I pick up the phone ... - Yeah . So I figured , I can be Betty . ( COMPUTERS AND GADGETS BEEPING ) ALEX : Bye , Betty . Thank you . Um , I 'm going to Alex 's ... or Munch 's ... or Tuck 's house , and we 're gonna play a video game and sleep over . BETTY : Wait , what 's all that stuff ? Honey ? ( SIGHS ) ALEX : Good job , Munch . You did it . TUCK : Here we come . 17.6 miles . ( TUCK HUMMING HAPPILY ) ♪ Going to the desert ... ♪ Munch , what are you doing ? Guys , guys , just hold on , hold on , hold on . - Dude ... - I 'm not backing out or anything , - He wants to quit right when we - ... just hear me out . - Been waiting for this forever . - Dude , listen , come on , okay . This is crazy what we 're doing . Dude , I don 't want to punk out or back out or anything ... it 's just , my mom , you know , she just got divorced . - Munch ... - She 's already had enough guys lying to her . If you didn 't want to come , then why didn 't you tell us earlier ? TUCK : You do understand this is our last night together . Yeah , I know , I know . Look , Munch , if we don 't go now , we 'll never go . We won 't even be here . This is our last chance to try and do something . Even-even if it is stupid . - Yeah . - You know what , I say we put a vote to it . All in favor raise your hand . Well , now I have to raise my hand . Munch , just ... Fine , fine . Okay , whatever . I 'll go . But only under one condition . TUCK : - I call the black ! ALEX : - Mine ! No , no , give it ! MUNCH : It 's so weird , no one 's gonna be in these houses next week . ALEX : Dude , you 're so full of it . - When did you kiss her ? TUCK : - Dude , trust me . After pre-algebra , she pulled me into the bathroom . Wait , wait , wait , wait ... Mannequin Girl ? TUCK : - Yeah ! - Was she good at it ? TUCK : Uh , eh , B minus . You know , I 've kissed better in better locations . No , how do I know you 're not lying ? TUCK : Trust me . I don 't even have to reply to you . - You 're last ! MUNCH : - Hey , you got a head start ! That 's not fair ! TUCK : Oh , so what , there 's a Wing Stop ? I never been to a Wing Stop . ( BIRDS SQUAWKING ) TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) We followed a map out in the middle of nowhere . MUNCH : It might be , like , a CIA prison . TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) We were miles from home . ( BOYS TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) No one in the world knew it . No one said it ... but we were scared . ALEX : We haven 't seen a car in , like , half an hour . TUCK : ( VOICE-OVER ) We were on our own . MUNCH : This-this is the way , right ? You have the map , right ? - Can I see the map ? ALEX : - Left . MUNCH : Left ? Are you sure ? Because right looks a little bit more promising . ( COYOTES HOWLING , YIPPING ) Did you guys hear that ? ALEX : Just a couple more miles . ( STEADY ELECTRONIC PULSING ) TUCK : Hold on . What is that ? It 's the map . TUCK : Are we close ? MUNCH : I never understood why people like the outdoors . TUCK : Will you stop freaking out ? ( ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES ) Yo , this is too steep , man . Let 's go , man . ( ELECTRONIC PULSING CONTINUES ) MUNCH : We 're getting pretty far from the road , guys . ALEX : Almost there . ( ELECTRONIC PULSING SLOWS ) TUCK : Is it this thing ? ( SIGHS ) ( ELECTRONIC TRILLING , THEN STATIC CRACKLING ) ALEX : I don 't think so . ( ELECTRONIC PULSING AND TRILLING STOP ) TUCK : Wait , what was that ? ALEX : - I don 't know . - Well , hold on .

A part of a satellite ? TUCK : All right , all right , um , Munch , film me while I 'm ... - while I 'm touching this thing . - Yeah , yeah , absolutely . Let me try it . Thank you . It 's dusty . It 's a piece of crap . MUNCH : What ? Forget about it . Just turn off the camera . MUNCH : Well , it 's not a national treasure , but it could be used for something . ( TUCK SCOFFS ) It 's crap . What happened to filming 'cause it 's our last night , huh ? Um , in case you haven 't noticed , obviously , the map led to squat . ALEX : Got it . So all you cared about was getting your stupid hits on your stupid video ? - Dude , why don 't you just ... MUNCH : - Whoa , guys , guys , guys . Come on ! I know we 're all frustrated ... ( PHONE RINGING , GASPS ) It 's Alex 's mom . TUCK : - Are you serious ? ALEX : - Um , it 'll be fine . Just , um , be Betty , okay ? - Oh , man . MUNCH : - Oh , crap . Yo , I thought I could do this , but I can 't . Maybe you can answer it . She just likes to check up on things , okay ? All right . ( GASPS ) WOMAN : Betty , are you there ? ( WHISPERING ) Go .

I don 't know what to call it . Look . You see that ? It 's a new map , but on my phone this time . To me ? All right , him , or ... Dude , Munch 's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and , ugh , I don 't even know what that is . Alex 's phone , it just turned on by itself and started filming . We can 't even turn them off . Oh , don 't try to act like it 's not cool . That is weird . ALEX : It 's showing us where we are . MUNCH : And you don 't find that creepy ? What do you think that is ? You think that 's a road ? We should follow the map . MUNCH : How about no . TUCK : How about yes ? We wanted a last night together , so what do you call this ? A trap ?

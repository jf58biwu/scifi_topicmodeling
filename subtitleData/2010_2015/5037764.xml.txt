 NARRATOR : Previously on V : Concordia . Humans think they 're building their future . They 're digging their graves . The one thing that Anna can 't give Tyler is his family back . TRAVIS : I heard all about what you did tonight , Jack . You 'll be laicized . I have a daughter . The way I get her is take Anna down . You infiltrated the Fifth Column . I wanna know if there are threats . MARCUS : Ryan Nichols just reported in . The Fifth Column is positioned to assassinate you . I 'll take your place . If we can 't cut the head off the beast , we can rob it of its hand . Do it . In headlines this morning Visitor High Commander Anna has yet to break her silence regarding the condition of her second in command , Marcus following last night 's assassination attempt at the gala Concordia event . No one has taken credit , but there 's little doubt that the anti-V terrorist group the Fifth Column , was behind the shooting . If you ask me , it 's only a matter of time before Anna is going to lose her cool and it is not going to be " of peace , always " anymore . Here 's another thought . How about we , in the tradition of civilized beings agree to hope for good news on Marcus 's condition and swift justice for those responsible for this shooting ? The bullet that struck you was meant for me . Your sacrifice will be avenged , Marcus . I will hunt down and kill Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column . They will pay for what they 've done . [ DOOR OPENS ] You look like someone just told you Santa Claus isn 't real . I just spent the last six hours getting raked over the coals by the FBI after-action team . I have been benched because Marcus was shot on my watch . Benched ? What do you mean ? For how long ? Not sure . Kendrick told me to stand by for debriefing . Told him I was gonna spend time with my family , which is good . Because that is exactly where I wanna be . So go home . If the FBI suspects anything , we 're all screwed . They suspect everything . Everyone is under the lens . We have to give Eli a heads-up . The Fifth Column has to keep their heads down . Right . There 's gonna be enough heat coming down from Anna . Yeah , well , if Ryan hadrt sold us out , Anna 'd be dead . We got a mole and until he 's flushed out , we 're all in danger . Anyone heard from him ? No , but when we do , I 'm putting a long overdue bullet in him . I need to look him in the eye first . Hear him say it . - Well , we have to find him for that . - Then do it . [ BABY CRYING ] It 'll be okay . I can 't get her to stop crying . She 's grown quite fond of me . [ BABY STOPS CRYING ] As if I were her own mother . But my touch will only soothe her for a moment . She will need my Bliss . What do you want ? The man responsible for the attempt on Marcus 's life . Eli Cohn . Tell him you wanna meet . Then kill him . The Fifth Columrs attack must be met with a response immediately . Eli 'll know I sold him out and warned you about the assassination . No way I 'll be able to get close to him to kill him . You were once my best hunter , Ryan . You 'll find a way . [ BABY CRYING ] [ RAPS ON DOOR ] The official papal decree regarding your status as a member of the priesthood . You 've been laicized , Jack . How many times have I warned you your hatred would cost you your faith ? It hasn 't cost me my faith . You must move out of the rectory within the week . I 'm sorry . Father Travis , I would ... I would like to lead one last service for my parishioners . They are no longer your parishioners , Jack . I must ask you for your collar . [ SNAPS ] Judas returns to complete his betrayal . Drop it . Take him . Alive . [ GRUNTS ] God help you now . Hey , Mom , you sure you can keep up with us ? Harley is a lot of bike . [ CHUCKLES ] Yeah ? Seriously , the question is , can you two keep up with me ? - Right . - Okay . It 's been so long since the three of us spent time together . It 's too long . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] - Evans . - I found Ryan . - How ? - He tried to kill me . Hang on . Hey , guys , I 'll just be a second . I 'll meet you out there . - Work . - Work . What are you gonna do ? Find out everything he told the Visitors about us . - Assure he never says anything again . - Wait . - Let me talk to him . - He 's your associate . So out of respect , I 'll wait . But make no mistake , either by my hands or yours Ryan Nichols is gonna die . The tracker you sent to follow Nichols has reported in . We followed him to Eli Cohrs base . Ryan has been captured . There are over 20 heavily-armed men inside the building . Shall I initiate an attack ? - No . - The window of opportunity is closing . It 's only just opening , Thomas . Call the FBI . Anonymously . Report a gathering of Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column terrorists . - And give a location . - Let humans do the dirty work while our hands remain clean . After their embarrassment over Marcus 's shooting the FBI won 't hesitate to use deadly force . I expect the Fifth Column will be happy to fight back . Yeah . Just received an anonymous tip . Possible Eli Cohn sighting . - Abandoned building , Upper East Side . - You trust it ? After the assassination fiasco , we can 't afford not to . - You think we should call Evans ? - Well , Chris . You 're running the IA investigation into her . What do you think ? If she 's dirty like we suspect , we can 't risk that she 'd tip him off . Okay . For now , we keep Evans out of the loop . God , Ryan . - I told you to wait . - He 's a traitor and was treated as such . Look at me . Why did you do this ? - Why did you betray us ? - You gotta get out of here . - Right now . - Not until you tell me the truth . Anna made my baby sick . She promised she would help if I did what she asked . But Erica , you gotta listen to me . Okay ? I came here for Eli , not you . Anna knows I 'm here . She put a tracker on my tail . If you don 't get out of here right now you 're dead . You 're all dead . Surveillance has picked up unusual movement . Multiple units approaching . Is that enough truth for you ? WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : All units . [ AGENTS CLAMORING ] [ SIRENS WAILING ] Those aren 't Visitors . It 's FBI . That 's my team . Those are my friends . Colleagues . I won 't let you kill them . You won 't let me kill , but you 're okay with them killing ? No . I 'm not . That is my unit . I know exactly what to do in order to avoid a bloodbath . Tell your men , no kill shots . - What then ? - Then we 'll find a way out of here . So much for trying to find a way out of here . - Looks like the entire FBI showed up . - You 're right . Everyone did show up . Everyone except for me . - I didn 't get a call . - They don 't trust you . No , they think I 'm working with you . Collaborating with the Fifth Column . We 're surrounded , Erica . I can 't get you out . You don 't have to . I 'm staying . As a hostage . That solves two problems . Clears you being here and buys us time to figure a way out of this . Hit me . If I 'm gonna sell that I 'm a hostage , I need to look like one . Hit me . CHAD : The waiting game continues here on the streets of New York outside Eli Cohrs building where Cohn , the mastermind behind the recent Fifth Column attacks may be holed up inside . We got no live phone lines . It 's gonna take an hour to sweep for any cell numbers inside . Okay , whatever you get , as soon as you get it . MAN 1 : Look ! MAN 2 : Check it out ! Up there . Chris , you might wanna look at this . - Oh , my God , that 's Erica . - How the hell did she get up there ? I don 't know , but she just gave us our line of communication . CHAD : We have just learned that Eli Cohn is holding hostages inside the building . Tyler 's mother is inside . - That wasrt part of your plan . - No . But maybe we can use it to our advantage . Seeing his mother die at the hands of the humans will turn him back to us . His mother dying isn 't enough . His father must die as well . Find a way to get Joe Evans inside that building . Tyler is critical to the future of our plans . His emotional ties to his family are all that keep him from us . It is time to sever them once and for all . You wanted to see me , Mother ? Tyler has decided to postpone his flight training . With the plans for Concordia moving ahead it 's critical he be aboard the ship as we prepare for the next phase . Yes , of course , Mother . You must do everything in your power to insure his cooperation . - Go , go , go . JOE : Go , go , go ! Run . Run it . Yes ! - Over 30 . Go for the 20 . JOE : Look at him go ! Go ! TYLER : Here we go ! And ... ! - Go , go , go ! COMMENTATOR [ ON TV ] : Just shy of the 10 yard line . - Man , we got a good team this year . - I know . I know . Oh , sweet . I 'm really glad you 're back , Dad . Me too . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] Hey , Lis . What ? No . No way . Okay , I will . Okay . We have to turn on the news , Dad . The hostage has now been identified as FBI Task Force Leader Erica Evans with unconfirmed reports of others held ... - Oh , God . - Upping the ante ... I 'll figure something out , Ty . I promise . But I gotta get down there . You stay here . Okay ? I 'll call you as soon as I know anything . It 's gonna be all right . Erica ? [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] Chris , I have a list of Eli 's demands . Number one , sharpshooters stand down . Two , pull all Tac Teams . - Three , any air cover and I 'm dead . - I got it . - Erica , are you alright ? - I 'm ... Well played . I 'm impressed . Well , I know how the FBI works , Eli . I only see two ways out of here for you . Dead or in cuffs . Not quite . There might be a third way . This technology will allow you to see inside the building and locate explosives of any size . You will be able to anticipate the terrorists ' every move . We 're grateful for your help , Thomas . Send my thanks to Anna . It is our only hope that our technology will allow you to end this standoff peacefully , with no loss of life . Joe Evans , Agent Evans ' ex-husband , just arrived on scene . - He wants an update . - Well , go talk to him . Last thing we need is panicked family right now . - Joe Evans ? - Yeah ? Agent Ray Caldwell , Hostage Rescue Team lead . - You must be Erica 's ex . - How did you know ? Erica 's a friend . She mentioned you were back . Seemed real happy about that . Look , Erica 's in danger in there . What are you guys doing about it ? We found a hidden entrance into the building Fifth Column doesn 't know . So why aren 't you in there now ? Fifth Column guys are dangerous . The bosses know it so they 're scared . Holding us up for now . But once we have a go , I promise you we 'll do everything we can to get Erica back safely . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE OVER EAR PIECE ] Copy that . Situation outside . Gotta go . Hey , uh ... Who 's that ? It 's my son and my husband . Ex . Ex-husband . I was supposed to spend the day with them . No Visitors . No Fifth Column . Just us . As a family . I keep this . ERICA : Aw . In times like this , it reminds me of what I 'm fighting for . For families like yours . Families the V 's haven 't destroyed yet . If we have something to say about it they never will . FIERRO : Eli . Found him in the basement . Broke through an old bricked-up tunnel . Joe ? What are you doing here ? I saw it on TV , you taken hostage . - I had to come . - Where 's Tyler ? He 's at home . He 's safe . - I 'm okay . - Erica , what 's going on ? - You told me about the V 's , but ... - It 's complicated . Look , I 'm not a hostage . I 'm with these people . How did you get in ? How did you get past the FBI barricade ? Through a tunnel . A friend of yours , Ray Caldwell on the HRT . He left behind some plans that showed a hidden route in . Erica , if you 're not a hostage , why aren 't we running for that tunnel ? Because I 've never heard of Agent Ray Caldwell . It 's an old bootlegger 's tunnel . Must 've run liquor through during Prohibition . Never knew it existed . Why would an agent leave plans like these for a civilian to find ? They wouldn 't . But a sleeper V might . Okay . Why would the V 's want your ex-husband in here ? - Come on , Dad . - Tyler , I 'm sure he 's okay . I gotta get down there . Ty , you promised your dad you 'd stay here . And he promised he 'd call . If everything was okay , he would . Tyler . I 'm going . I 'll call you in a bit . The FBI was grateful for our assistance . What about Joe Evans ? Inside the building , as you requested . Good . Soon Eli Cohn and the Fifth Column will be destroyed . And I 'll have Tyler back . With Agent Evans inside and at risk , the FBI will not take aggressive action . They will not have to . Marcus has an asset on the ground . Kyle Hobbes . He 's a mercenary . He 'll do as we ask . - Do we need a human ? - He won 't stand out like a soldier or a tracker . Nothing will trace back to us . And all the blood spilled will be by the hands of the humans . - Something 's not right . - What ? Snipers are locking onto targets they couldn 't see . How does the FBI know where they are ? Anna must be helping them . If the FBI is moving , they 're ready to storm the building . Take your men out . What are you doing ? Buying us more time . [ CELL PHONES RING ] Right . On my signal . [ CROWD SCREAMS ] Everybody , stay back ! Stay back ! Stay back and let us through or we will blow all of you to pieces ! - Lower your weapon ! - Stand down . - Abort the action . SUICIDE BOMBER : Keep back ! KENDRICK : They 've got explosives and hostages . No . What the hell are you doing ? Taking hostages is not our deal . Those aren 't just hostages . They 're your lifeline . ERICA : I didn 't agree to this , Eli . Those are innocents . I told you I wouldn 't do it this way . Look around you , Erica . No one is safe . Your sors father 's there , delivered from the safety of his home into this crucible . And he may die . We may all die . And why ? Because of Anna and the Visitors . If we don 't protect the innocents , then we are no better than the Visitors . The hostages right now are the only way to ensure that you live . That Tyler 's father lives and that the Fifth Column lives . I will die for this cause if I have to . I have no illusions I 'm gonna walk out of here alive . But you and Joe must . And so must he . John Fierro , my most trusted colleague . He knows my Fifth Column contacts all over the world . Every plan . Every detail . I 've led my share of battles against the Visitors . Those battles are yours now . You want me to lead ? Why me ? We couldn 't disagree more about how to fight this war . Maybe , but I 've seen something in you . Something that 's far more important . See , you understand that this fight is for our future . For our families ' future . And at the end of the day , that 's what this cause needs more than anything . Now , take these people out to safety . Protect your cover , come out a hero . Live to fight Anna another day . [ SIRENS WAILING AND ONLOOKERS CHATTERING ] Excuse me , sorry . Excuse me . Need to get through here , please . - Look , I gotta get in there , please . AGENT : Nobody gets in . Nobody . HOBBES : What ? - Hobbes . - Have you heard what 's going on ? - The standoff ? - Hard not to . - Look , you gotta get down here . I got a feeling the V 's are in the middle of this . Too hot for me to be anywhere near there , Jack . Remember , I 'm a wanted man . - Keep me posted , eh ? - No , Hobbes ... THOMAS : Kyle Hobbes ? My name is Thomas . I have an assignment for you from Anna . As fun as that sounds , I think I 'll bloody pass . You made a deal with Marcus . You work for us , she stays alive . Right . Problem is , Sarah 's dead . - She died five years ago . - Her body was never recovered . You should know this , you searched for her for years . Lucky for you , we found her . I want proof of life . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] SARAH : Kyle , they 've got me . - Sarah ? Where is she ? You pull that trigger , you 'll never find out . Bring this within 100 yards of Eli Cohrs compound . It will detonate the explosives brought inside by the suicide bombers . Do it or you will never see Sarah alive again . Come to check on the handiwork of your friends ? People are scared . Damn right they 're scared . Because of you . You had your chance , maybe even prevented this . But right now my partner , my friend , is in there . - So you wanna help ? - Get your hands ... Pray she gets out of this alive . Because if she doesn 't , I 'm coming for you . AGENT : Stand back , please . - I came to say goodbye . - Don 't leave me here , Erica . I had no one to help me save my daughter . - No one else to turn to but Anna . - No . You had me . You could 've come to me . Why didn 't you ? I never planned for you to be here . You betrayed us . Not just the Fifth Column , but me . You betrayed me and Jack . Your friends . We trusted you , we fought beside you . We defended you . I gave you my word . And I will do everything that I can to help your daughter . But I can never forgive you . I 'm sorry . It 's too late . - It 's time . - Yeah . Fierro 's going to blend in and walk out with the hostages . I 'll lead the way . Prove me right about you , Erica Evans . ERICA : Hey . - You ready ? - Yeah . - Good . - Erica , I ... I should 've trusted you . It 's in the past . We have so much time to make up for . Let 's go home . Okay . Our snipers have Cohrs men in their sites . Get ready to move on my signal . Stay sharp , this could happen at any time . [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] - Hit it . - Hello ? This is not going by the book . The FBI should be negotiating , not getting ready to move . There 's no one I trust , that 's why I called you . - What 's going on ? - Eli wants to release the hostages . But first he wants assurances . He wants the chance to surrender . And I want assurances too . Make sure once we 're out in the open , the hostages will get to safety . I 'll make sure no one on our side fires a shot , unless they 're fired upon . As far as Cohrs assurances , tell him whatever he wants . - But he 's not walking away from this . - I understand . But first , we make sure the hostages are safe . Okay . Deal . CHAD [ ON SCREEN ] : Eli Cohn has once again taken the world by surprise . Upping the ante as this tense standoff with the Fifth Column continues . As we now wait to hear demands ... - Is Mr. Hobbes in position ? - Yes , my queen . He is on-site and awaits your order . Any moment now , we 're going to see the hostages being led out . Here they come now . AGENT [ OVER RADIO ] : All teams , all teams , hold your fire . I repeat , hold your fire . CHAD : It appears there are nine total hostages . Identities have not yet been confirmed . Agent Erica Evans is among the hostages . [ BEEPS ] [ BEEPING ] [ PEOPLE CLAMORING ] [ SCREAMS ] ERICA : Come on , lets go ! [ GRUNTS ] Watch your fire . We 've got an agent and eight hostages out there . [ GRUNTS ] ERICA : Chris , I need some help ! - Get them safe ! - [ INAUDIBLE ] Come on , come on . CHRIS : No , Erica , no . There 's too much gunfire . Joe ! CHRIS : No . Joe ! Come on . Come on . Joe . My God . What just happened here ? [ SIRENS WAILING PEOPLE CLAMORING ] WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : - That area as best as you can . ERICA : Tyler . We were wrong about her . She 's clean , Paul . I 'll kill the paperwork . The investigation into Erica Evans is over . Once again , Mother , I have succeeded where you failed . The Fifth Column has been devastated . Don 't worry . You 'll hear from them again . My breeding program is back on track . All that 's left is to conquer the soul . How long are we going to do this , Daughter ? - Do what ? - This dance . You come down here , you circle me . You gloat . It 's unbecoming of a queen . And a sign of weakness . Unlike you , I have no weaknesses . Why do you need to prove yourself to me ? Prove myself ? To a broken queen rotting down here in a dungeon ? Why would I need to do that ? Because you need me . You wouldn 't be down here if you didn 't . I understand now . What you have been trying to do . And it will not work . What will not work ? Your attempt to fuel human emotions in me . Every time I come down here , you strike at my nerves . So that I 'll lose control and destroy my ability to lead . And I thought it was working so well . If you wanna destroy me try harder . Oh , I will . DIANA : Back so soon ? - Lisa ? - Who are you ? Don 't be frightened . I am your grandmother . Diana . I knew you 'd find me eventually . I don 't understand . I was told you were dead . No one must know . Not yet . It 's our secret . How do I know I can trust you ? Because we share the same enemy . Your mother . Tyler ? Where are you going ? - Where do you think ? - No . No . Tyler , please . I need you . We are still a family . Family ? What family ? Dad 's dead . It 's Anna 's fault , all of it . No , Mom . You always blame the V 's . But it was people , not the Visitors , that killed Dad today . Tyler , you 're wrong . You are wrong . I promise you , I did everything that I could to save him . Well , you didn 't do enough . If you would 've done your job . If you would 've protected him . If you stopped the Fifth Column like you 're supposed to maybe Dad would be alive . I 'm sorry . [ SOBS ] I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] JACK : Erica . I am so sorry . Joe is dead . Tyler left to live aboard the ship . And there ... There 's nothing I can do about it . Eli left me in charge of the Fifth Column he built . Every cell , every soldier around the world . My first act as leader will be to declare that we go on the offensive . No more reacting to Anna . We strike first , we strike hard . Who 's with me ? I was a soldier once . I 'll be a soldier again . I 'm in . No matter the cost . I should 've listened to you about Ryan . - Sorry . - No . It 's on me . Should 've taken the lizard out when I had the chance . I got you into this because I needed a warrior . But I 've kept you caged . Not anymore . You got me , Erica . Come what bloody may . Good . We have an army now . And we are going to rain hell on the Visitors . [ English - US - SDH ]

 Subs By AB69 , corrected resynced ♪ ♪ by AsifAkheirESL @ teachers.org 50 years ago , an alien force known as the Formics attacked Earth . Tens of millions died . It was only through the sacrifice of our greatest commander that we avoided total annihilation . We 've been preparing for them to come back , ever since . The International Fleet decided that the world 's smartest children are the planet 's best hope . Raised on war-games , their decisions are intuitive , decisive , fearless . I am one of those recruits . I 've watched through his eyes , I 've listened through his ears and I tell you , he 's the one ! That 's what you said about his brother . Brother tested out impossible for other reasons . Nothing to do with his tactical abilities . - I gotcha ! I gotcha ! - Try there ... go back ! He 's gonna crush him . Come on ! - You can 't do that . - You 've got to use what 's around you . No no , I had you all the way through the belt ! You calculated your trajectory wrong due to the incoming asteroids . Don 't lecture me . Wiggin . You cheated ! It was a good game . Thanks . HEY ! Play again ! Sorry . Tomorrow , maybe ? See , he 's got a talent for strategy . His humility could be false , part of a strategy to avoid antagonizing an ego-driven opponent . Which makes him even smarter . He may be a genius but we need someone the others will follow . A leader . He can 't win on his own . Well , let 's see how he handles rejection . Andrew Wiggin ! Andrew ... Ender Wiggin ... Please report to the infirmary ! Ender Wiggin to the infirmary . - Hello Ender ! - Hello ! That nasty monitor is coming out today . Please , lie face down . Am I off the program ? - Did I do something wrong ? - That 's not really for me to say . Lie down . The sooner we get this done , the sooner you can move on . Ready ? This won 't hurt a bit . Where do you think you 're going , Wiggin ? Washed out , huh ? - Come on ! - Come on ! Get him in there ! Come on , chief ... one on one , for real this time . - No games . - He 's got no monitor now . - That 's right . No one watching you now , Wiggin . One-on-one , then why are your boys holding me ? Let 's go ! Come on , man ! - Stay down . - I 'm gonna kill you , chief . Take it easy , Ender . You might be thinking of ganging up on me ... But just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me . He said I was cheating ... said that was why I was off the program . And I kept on kicking him ... - Doesn 't matter . - ... even after he was down . - He 'll never bully you again . - All I could think was what would Peter do ? - I 'm just like him , now . - No . No , you 're nothing like him Ender . Nothing like who ? - I thought you had a game . - Rained out ... - What 's he crying about ? - I 'm not crying ! My monitor 's gone . Now I 'm just like you . You mean Mom Dad spent all that money on a Third , now he 's off the program , too ? Stop it , Peter . He made it farther than either of us . Hey , drop out , remember how to play Formics and astronauts ? - That 's it . Where 's mom ? - No . Don 't . - I 'll play . - Put the mask on ... you can be the bug . - Peter , you 're sick ! - Stay out of this , Valentine . - No . Stop it . - Alright bug . You started it , you attack first . - Let me in . - Come on . - Come on , fight back . At last , we 've got one of you alive . - Peter , stop ! You know , I could kill you just like this . - Please ! - I should 've been chosen ! Deep Space intel shows us that the number of enemy ships already deployed is 10 times those we faced during the first invasion . The Formics are rebuilding and strengthening their fleet . We must conquer or die . Turn it off please , John . Why ? You 'd rather not know what 's going on in the world ? We must never again bear witness to the slaughter of tens of millions of innocent people as we did during the Formic invasion . I 'd rather you talk to your son . Our survival demands total commitment to the destruction of the enemy ... If you want , I 'll go away . So you don 't have to be embarrassed . Ender , no one is embarrassed . I 'm a Third . I should never have been born . No . We wanted you , Ender . We just needed permission . John , please say something . It 's a tough program , Ender . When they brought me to this country , there was less competition and still I didn 't make it . You have nothing to be ashamed of nothing . # Sensor alert ! Front door ... Please state your name . # Colonel Hyrum Graff , Director of Training , International Fleet . This is my colleague , Major Anderson . May we ? Why 'd you keep kicking him ? You had already won the fight . - Did you enjoy it ? - No . Then why ? Speak up , son . Knocking him down was the first fight . I wanted to win all the next ones , too . So they 'd leave me alone . Don 't you think you should have asked a grown up for help ? Nonsense ! He can fight his own battles . Colonel , he was obviously being bullied and he defended himself . Son ... I 'd like to offer you a place in our program . But you took away my monitor . The final step in our evaluation is always to see what happens when the monitor is removed . And he passed ? He put a child in the hospital . It 's not what he did , it 's why he did it . It was tactical , a strategy to stop future attacks . Andrew , you don 't have to do this . Ender and I should have a private conversation . - Absolutely not . - With all respect sir , you really can 't stop me . Formics might have wiped us out the last time , you know . A brilliant commander is the only thing that saved us . Mazer Rackham ? Mazer Rackham ! We need minds like yours , Ender . Young people integrate complex data more easily than adults . Will the monitor be reinstalled ? No . You graduated . To Battle School . Privacy rights restored . If there 's a chance , because of you , the Formics might leave us alone forever ... then I have to ask you to come with me . It 's what I was born for , right ? Valentine was too compassionate for Battle School . My brother Peter washed out because he was too quick to violence . Colonel Graff said I needed to find a balance between those emotions if I were to succeed . Join the others . Go on ! - You 're late ! - Out of my control . I 'm Ender . Ender ? What kind of name is that ? What 's your name ? Name 's Bean . - Bean ? - Grew up on the streets . Not worth a bean . T minus 5 seconds and counting . - I 'm gonna be ... - Bag ! Give him the bag ! Close the bag ! - You alright ? - Yeah . What 're you doing , Wiggin ? - Nothing , sir . - Something funny ? I asked you a question , launchy . Sir , the way you 're floating . Horizontally . I thought that was funny . Really , why ? Because in zero gravity , there is no right side up . You may think you 're vertical and we may be horizontal . - Is that funny ? - Sir , no sir ! Yes , it is . Alai , you know what he is talking about ? - Yes , sir . - No , you don 't . There 's only one kid on this launch with any brains at all so far and that 's Ender Wiggin . # All new arrivals follow the yellow lights to your accommodation . The yellow lights . # # All new arrivals follow the yellow lights to your accommodation . The yellow lights . # Sir , you made them hate me . I told them you were the best . We need a Julius Caesar , a Napoleon . We hope that would be you . - Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted . - Napoleon lost in the end . Not before he conquered the known world . - Dismissed . - Yes , sir . He has a complicated response to authority . He wants to please the overbearing father figure but resents the lack of reciprocated affection . His isolation can never be broken . He must never believe anyone will help him . Oh look . It 's the smartass . Thanks ! Thought I 'd have to ask to be by the door . # State your name . # - Ender Wiggin . - Don 't freeze your balls , kid . - Attention on deck . At ease . Listen up , Launchies ! My name is Sergeant James Dap . Ask me a legitimate question and I will give you a direct answer .. but if you are looking for a shoulder to cry on , use a pillow . - Do I look like I 'm joking , snots ? - Sir ! No , sir ! Good . You are to work as a team .. You will all make this bunkroom , your home . You will keep your home clean . There are separate showers for both sexes . If you 're found in an area not designated to your gender , I will personally neuter you . Am I clear ? - Sir ! Yes sir ! Class is in five . Follow the yellow lights . Yellow like your cowardly selves . - Sir ! Yes , sir ! Welcome to Battle School . A great responsibility rests upon each of you . When the enemy first invaded , we were not ready . Millions of innocent lives were lost . That must never be allowed to happen again . We threw everything we had at the invaders . And in the midst of that decisive battle , a legendary hero emerged . We will never forget what the enemy did but we defeated them . and we will do so again . Let the courage of Mazer Rackham be your inspiration . Wakey wakey . Rise and shine . Put on your Battle Room suits That 's the padded one with the helmet and the weapon . Do not attempt to fire the weapon . Holster it ! Let 's move it launchies , you 've got 10 minutes ! At ease ! This is the Battle Room . In here , the floor 's been designed to create an Earth-like gravitational pull . Step through that gate and you are in a zero-G environment . Wiggin ! Get up here . - What do I do now , sir ? - Go on in . Alright now , push off . Nicely done . These guys are still trying to stay up the way they came in . But like you said in the shuttle , there is no up or down in space . But we 'll need some way to orientate in here maybe the enemy 's gate is down ? - I get it , like they 're a bug to be crushed under our feet . - Exactly . - What do you think this does ? - Let 's find out . Whoa ! Won 't acts harmless ... - What do you think it does when it hits the suit ? - Good question . - Shoot me in the leg . - We shoot each other . Same time . Ready ? - Whoa ! My leg 's frozen ! - Mine too . I can 't bend my knee ... Shoot me in the chest ... Come on ! I 'm getting away . - This is amazing ... I can 't move at all now . - You 're out of your mind . That 's enough . You 're flapping around like a bunch of drunken ducks . If you expect to compete with the other teams at this School you 've got a lot to learn . Sergeant , explain the game ! - Yes Sir ! You will train to compete as a team against other teams . You get 1 point for a hit to a limb , six for a torso hit which will immobilize you completely but if either side gets one cadet through the enemy 's gate unharmed that army will win . Regardless of points already scored . - Am I clear ? - Sir ! Yes Sir ! Dear Valentine , so this is Battle School ... Every day , hours of training and far more homework than we ever had on Earth . We train in hand-to-hand combat it keeps us in shape and aggressive . - And up ! And one ! Two ! - I feel Peter in me whenever I fight ... - Wiggin ! ... I wish I didn 't . We 've been studying Formic flight patterns for three months now , they seem entirely random . The truth is we really don 't understand our enemy ... and no one ever adequately explains how Mazer Rackham actually defeated the entire fleet . The Colonel said he expects me to lead But how ? What makes a good leader ? Everyone here is very different . So many many things to learn , always very little sleep . Please write back . I haven 't heard from you ... How are you ? Is Peter behaving ? Are you getting my e-mails ? I miss ... Attention on deck ! Evening , launchies . At ease . I 'm pleased to see that most of you are performing well as you know , competition for Command School is tough some in the higher ranks have failed to meet our standards and are being sent home . So ... I may have the opportunity to promote some of you . Look to your left . Look to your right . These are NOT your friends ! They are competition ! - Keep up the hard work ! - Ten-shun ! Sir ! Is our email being blocked ? It 's just that none of us received any replies from home . All communication is being temporarily held back . - Why sir ? - Launchy , it is not your place ... Your families will not understand what we 're doing here and none of you need the distraction of their replies ! I thought our privacy rights had been restored , sir . You have the right to privately think whatever you wish , Wiggin ! But there 's too much at stake to allow your unfiltered thoughts .. ... to leave this facility . Yes , sir ! Keep it up snot , and you will never make it to Command School ! - I thought it was a legitimate question . - What ? - You said if we have a legitimate question ... - Drop and give me twenty ! - You think you 're the smartest kid in the School ? - No , sir ! - You will never be a Commander ! I will never salute you ! - Yes you will , Sergeant . - Give me twenty more ! Get up ! You do not speak unless spoken to . Am I clear ? Sir ! Yes , sir ! - Even if I have a legitimate question ? - Shut it , Wiggin ! Now go to sleep . All of you . You heard him . Get some sleep . We have only 3 passing scores on the Deep Space navigation test . Alai , Bean and Ender ! What happened here ? - They probably cheated . - Your mother cheated that 's why you look like a plumber . - Zip it ! You think this is a game ? - No , ma 'am . - We are preparing for war ! - Yes , ma 'am . Now the problem was simple ... how do you slingshot your forces into an attack position on the blind side of this moon using the gravitational pull from this planet ? This is basic rocket science , people ! Ender ! Get down here and explain . Ma 'am , I think Bean or Alai have a better handle on this than I do . Alright . Alai , come and explain . Ma 'am , we aim to approach the planet in the direction it 's moving . - That way we benefit from its energy of motion . - Something funny ? - Go on , Alai . - Of course , there 's a moon we have to pass here . That complicates things . Because the moon 's moving in the opposite direction to us , we get a gravitational break in ... Who sent this ? Who sent what , Bernard ? Nothing . Oh . - If you can 't take it Bernard , don 't dish it out . - Yes , ma 'am ! Welcome to Games and Recreation . Cerebral control enabled . One is poison , one is not . Choose right and you go to Fairyland . He 's found the mind game . Decide or I 'll bite yer head off ! - Bad luck . - Who authorized his access to this ? - I did . Try again , little mouse . - To what end ? - Not every battle can be won , Hyram . The way he plays the game reveals his state of mind . If you won 't let me assess him one-on-one , I need some other way to know what he 's feeling . I don 't care how he 's feeling . I want him to toughen up , learn how to lead . But before we make him a leader , let 's see how he deals with frustration . - Come on ! - Oh dear ! - Whatcha doin ' ? - Playing a stupid game . No matter what I choose , I die . - It 's rigged . - You 're back . One more time . - Can I watch ? - Sure . One is poison , one is not . Choose right and you go to Fairyland . - Which you gonna choose ? - Neither . Come on little mouse , come on . Aaah ! - You killed him . Why ? - That 's what they want from us . Follow the rules , you lose . Choose violence , you win . - I 've never seen anyone do that . - Perfect ... . He 's perfect ! Ender Wiggin , you are assigned to Salamander army , Commander Bonzo Madrid , effective immediately . Orders of Colonel Graff . Follow the green lights . Take nothing with you . Go now . - What are they doing ? - They 're promoting you . Ender . Yeah ? 'As-salaam-aleykum ' . Peace to you . - C 'mon ! - Ball ! Strike two ! Play ball ! - Alright , sir - strike two . - Play ball ! You lost , Launchy ? I 'm Ender Wiggin supposed to report to Bonzo Madrid . So you 're the replacement ? - Ender Wiggin . - Petra Arkanian . Only girl in the Salamander army with more balls than anybody else in this bunk room . Whoo ! Mama Petra , she talking ! - Wiggin ! - Sir , yessir ! Andrew Wiggin , reassigned . I asked for a replacement for O 'Reilley and this is what I get ! A useless , skinny , untrained snot . - I 'm a quick study . - Let me be clear ! I intend to trade you A.S.A.P. My army is undefeated in the last 21 battles I might try to make it to Command School within 6 months you can get your training at someone else 's expense . - He 's all heart . - Shut it , nica ( raguan ? ) ! - Easy , Bonzo . Watch your mouth , Mick ! Here 's the deal , snot when we go into battle , you will not pass through the gates until all my soldiers are through . Then , you will remain just inside the gates , with your weapon undrawn and unfired till the game ends . - So I must do nothing ? - You 're to keep out of the way ! You bunk in the back of the room . You know , Bonzo doesn 't like to lose . He doesn 't want an untrained Launchy screwing up his perfect maneuvers . But the Battle Room 's open 24 / 7 . During free time , I could show you some moves . Ready ? In 3 ... 2 ... 1 ! Impressive ! Your turn . OK , you can 't just keep your thumb on the trigger . You need half a second to recharge . - At least you don 't have any bad habits . - I don 't have any good ones , either . I 'll give you those . Relax ! The further your target , the longer you have to hold the beam . Fire . Even longer . It 's the difference between a tenth and ½ second but in battle that 's a long time Aim . Fire . Hold . Recharge . That 's it ! Learn where your trigger action fires and ride the edge . Now you 're getting it ! In 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Go ! - Let 's see you beat me , once ! Just beat me once ! - Come on ! You can do it ! - That 's five in a row ! Who 's the boss ? - You the boss Bonzo . That 's right , I 'm the boss . Let 's go again ! I 'm gonna make this six . - Ready ? What you guys doing ? C 'mon - Yeah , let 's do it again sometime . That was fun . - Where were you ? - Practicing . - In free time . - You don 't practice with her . In fact , you don 't practice at all ! May I speak to you privately , sir ? Wiggin ! Hey , pendejo ( pubic hair ) , don 't you ever turn your back on me ! If I 'm gonna be useful in this too , I have to practice . - You will do what I tell you ! - I will follow all commands you are authorized to give But if you take away my free time I will get you iced . Are you threatening me , snot ? No . Listen . I know you wanna trade me . But no one will take me if I don 't know anything . Let me practice , you can get rid of me sooner . I already gave you an order ! I know , in front of everybody and you don 't want your soldiers to think that you backed down . So for tonight you can say that you won this argument . Then tomorrow you can tell everybody that you changed your mind . You 'll look generous . I 'll get to train . We both win . Deal ? You better watch your back , Wiggin ! Wake up ! Wake up mis pendejos ! Battle with Leopard in 10 minutes ! - Hey , Wiggin ! - Yessir ! - I changed my mind . - Maybe by watching my toons you 'll learn something and I can trade you easier . - Yessir ! Thank you sir ! Move . Everybody , let 's move ! ♪ Salamander 's number one ♪ There 's no one like us under the sun ! ♪ Salamanders ! We 're on top ♪ When it comes to winning , we never stop ! Salamander halt ! At ease . What 's the play ? Four winds - Toon A , up . B , left . C , right . D , down . You ! Wiggin . You hang back , near the gate . - Bonzo , my toon will be a man short . - He knows nothing about our formation , Stink . He 'll only get in the way . You come out last . Hang back and observe . We don 't need you . Step aside . Go Salamander ! Go ! Go ! Go ! ... Go Salamander ! Go ! Go ! We gotta break ' em up ! Fly , you lock with me . Petra rides chariot . - Got it ! - Ready ? - Ready ! - In ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 - I 'm hit ! - Me too ! Keep shooting , Petra ! - Buddy 's hit ! Go ! - I 'm on it ! Stay behind me ! We need cover ! Wiggin ! What are you doing ? I told you to stay back ! - You ok ? - What are you doing here ? Bonzo will kill you ! - Can 't go back now . - Well then get in the game . We 're losing ! They got half their toon back near their gate . Put your feet to mine . Redirect me . - Play dead . Don 't draw your weapon , till you know you have a shot . - Got it . In 3 ... 2 ... 1 .. Smart move ! Holding Wiggin back . Where 'd you learn all this ? - I had a brother . - Had ? - Have . Come on , let 's go again . But use your arms , not your hips . Officer on deck ! Ten-hut ! I thought I told you not to train with her . It thought we 'd agreed that free time was free , sir . At ease . Stop it , Bonzo ! Try making me look like a fool again and I 'll kill you . You ok ? Yeah . What do you want me to do ? Valentine ? How can you be in my game ? Well done . You 're a killer now . Nightmares , Launchy ? Keep ' em to yourself ! You said the game would reveal his state of mind , not screw with it . How did his psycho brother end up in the game ? - He 's obviously feeling some psychological pressure ... - Of course he 's feeling pressure , Anderson . This is a boot camp , for kids who are gonna have to face a real enemy ! The game is a thought relationship between the child and the computer . Together they create stories . Then change the story . This stories reflect the child 's emotional reality . I can 't change that ! I don 't know how these images got into the game ! Erase the game . You 've done well . Very well . Top test scores in class . Highest Battle Room ratings . But you have a habit of upsetting your commander . I find it hard to respect someone just because they outrank me , sir . - Puts you in a difficult position , doesn 't it ? - Yes , sir . You don 't like taking orders from Bonzo . No , sir . Perhaps you 'd prefer to give them yourself ? - Sir ? - How 'd you like to lead your own army , Dragon army ? Sir , I 've never heard of a Dragon army . We discontinued the name four years ago . No Dragon army ever won a battle . - Then why not a new name , sir ? - Because we already have the uniforms . And who will be in this army , sir ? Misfits , like you . Oddballs , who might just be brilliant , with the right commander . Your new quarters . Your soldiers are being notified now . You 'll address them in 15 minutes . Do you think they 'll follow me ? Atten-hut ! Officer on deck . At ease . Welcome to Dragon army . Bunking will be arranged with youngest at the front and veterans at the back . - Ender , every other commander has their seniors closest to the door . - Well , I don 't intend to be like every other commander . What am I doing here Ender ? You don 't even like me . I didn 't select this army , Bernard but I intend to make it the best in this school . I think you can help make that happen . Am I wrong ? No , sir ! You 'll respect one another . If anybody has an idea they think is better than mine , I wanna hear it . I can 't be expected to do all the thinking in this army , can I , Bean ? No , sir ! Then let 's get suited up . - Training starts now ! - Sir ! Yessir ! He 's pushing them hard . Might even make something of Bernard . Command School 's pressing for a decision . Tell them we need more time ! We 're out of time . - Lieutenant ! Tomorrow 's game will commence at 03 : 00 . - Yes Sir ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Battle with Salamander AND Leopard in five ! Two armies at once ! The Colonel 's changing the rules ! In a battle with the Formics , there will be no rules ! You alright ? I twisted my ankle . How bad ? - Not good . - Dink , get him to the infirmary . The rest of you , let 's move ! C 'mon ! We 're late ! C 'mon ! They already opened the gate ? - Petra ? - Two armies weren 't enough ? They had to block your view too ? What are you doing here ? Colonel said you needed a sub . Guess he thought your odds were zero with me on the other team . - Bonzo agreed to this ? - Colonel Graff 's orders ! - He didn 't have a choice ! Dink . Kneel . - What ? - I have an idea ... Kneel . Ready in , 3 ... 2 ... 1 ! Fire ! - Whoa , whoa ! Look out ! - Aah ! 12 men on the wall ! 12 down , 20 to go . They could be right behind these forward stars , or all the way back at their gate . - Ready ? - Ready ! Pull ! They both have a bunch of stars around their gate , like a giant doughnut .. they 're just hanging behind ' em . - No one closer ? - Nah . Nice . Let 's see how they handle a formation . - We 've never done a formation . - Then they won 't expect one . We still outnumber 'em . - We storm 'em and crush 'em . - Nay ! We hold our positions . He has to come to us ! We can 't lose ! Open fire ! They 're drifting outward ! On my count , go to 3rd from 1 . We 're changing direction , 30 ° in , 3 2 1 Now ! Toon four , toon 6 , now ! Toon 5 , now ! - I 'm hit ! - Hold on , Alai ! - You OK ? - Are we there yet ? - Almost . Keep close Alai can 't get hit . Nearly there ! Keep shooting ! We did it ! Eat that ! Dragons rule ! Yeah ! Who 's gonna beat us now ? Still think he 's not ready ? Don 't be smug . I 'm tired of you , Wiggin . You know , your father would be proud . Come to fight a boy in the shower . With your buddies . Go watch the door . GO ! Look . You can say you won . I 'll say you taught me a lesson . You 're all covered ! Raise your fists . Come on , fight ! C 'mon ! C 'mon fight ! C 'mon ! I could break your arm ! Bonzo ? Bonzo ! Bonzo ! Help ! We need help in here ! Everybody knows he started it . Ender I 'm so sorry . Major ! - We should never have allowed you to be alone ... - Not now , Major ! Leave us ! Leave him . Now ! You too , cadet . He 's gonna die , isn 't he ? No . No . Please don 't lie to me . We 're gonna send him home , back to Earth , so he can get better . - I wanna go with him . - We can 't let you go . - You 've come so far . - And I wanna talk to my sister ! The fleet owns you , Ender . Strategos would never allow it . Send me home Colonel , or I will resign . Don 't threaten me , boy , I 'm not the enemy . I 'm not so sure . I won 't play this game anymore ! I quit ! What are you gonna do ? Waste millions on a loser ? You wanted to see me . You can 't resign . You have an obligation to stay here and convince him to do his duty . My father trained horses . I 've raised yearlings since I was 5 years old . I know a thoroughbred when I see one . We can 't lose him ! My God ! You really don 't see them as children , do you ? It used to be a war crime to recruit anyone under the age of 15 ! When the war 's over we can have the luxury of debating the morality of what we do . When it 's over , what will be left of the boy ? What does it matter if there 's nothing left at all ? We 're using these children to win the war . And if they come home , it 's my job to put them back together again . Thanks for what you 've done . Where 's Ender ? - Hello Valentine . - Why are you here ? Did something happen ? - He won 't let me see him . I need you to take a ride with me . He 's gonna be happy to see you . C 'mon , you just want him to re-enlist . I want him to save lives . What about his life ? I been sitting by Bonzo 's bed waiting for him to recover . He may never wake up . - Ender , he attacked first . - And I fought back . Just like Peter taught me . I 've had a lot of fights , Val . I 've won because I ' ve always understood the way my enemy thinks . - When I truly understand them ... - you also love them . I think it 's impossible to truly understand someone and not love them the way they love themselves . But in that moment ... - You beat them . - I destroy them ! I make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again . Ender , they want me to talk you into going back . - I told them I won 't cooperate . - I don 't think you 're hiding here just because you care about Bonzo . Afraid you don 't know your enemy afraid you might lose , but but what if you are the next Mazer Rackham ? You can 't hide here forever . If you stay here if you don 't try , then we will all be lost . I 'll miss you . I 'll miss you too . I need to know that you will not block my e-mails again . Attention ! Prepare for transporter docking operations . Initiating final approach ! I thought we were going back to Battle School ? - We 're not . - Where are we going ? Much further . " Dear Valentine , I must now travel to our advance command base near the Formics home planet where I 'll begin final training . If successful , I 'll command the entire invasion fleet . I wish there was another way but war seems inevitable . Stay safe . Love , Ender . " Not very hospitable , is it ? We took it from the Formics , 27 years after Rackham 's victory . Flushed them out of these tunnels like rats from a sewer . Drove them all the way back to their home planet . - How long did they live here ? - We 're not sure . This was a forward staging post for their invasion of Earth . We built our base here to be closer to their home planet to allow instantaneous communication by ansible with our attack fleet . If they 're on their home planet , do we have them contained ? - For now . - If we have them boxed in , why go to war ? For the same reason that you kept kicking that bully before I recruited you . The purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars . Your training begins first thing tomorrow morning . Sergeant Dap will show you to your quarters . Yes , sir ! We 're still reseeding the atmosphere it 's breathable , but thin . In the event of an evacuation , two breaths every minute from one of these will compensate for lower levels of surface oxygen . Lights out in five . Who are you ? Look , this may be amusing to you , but they 'll come looking for me ! You wanna fight me ? Is that the test ? To see if I 'll attack an old man ? Well , I won 't . I 'll just sit this one out . - Okay , you win . - Since when do you tell the enemy when he has won ? I surprised you once . Why didn 't you destroy me immediately after ? - I thought you were a teacher ! - There is no teacher but the enemy . Only he will tell you where you 're weak , where he 's strong . From now on , I am your enemy , got it ? Yes . Good . During training , I will devise the strategy of your enemy . Remember he is stronger than you . From now on , you are always about to lose . Sir . Do you have a name ? Mazer Rackham ! What ? You thought I was dead ? Sir I 've been building models of your plane since I was six years old . I have a question , sir . On the vids , they always cut out right after you destroy the one carrier . Why ? Get dressed . Sir , I 've already seen this . I wanna know what happens after . Just watch . After the explosion cleared everything was incredibly still . Their ships just stopped shooting . Then they started falling out of the sky . Scroll back , please . To just after you lost your wingman . There . Play back , please . You took cover in the cloud you couldn 't see anything so you must have been using your HUD . There ! Stop ! You saw something . What did you see in your HUD ? Did you find a pattern ? Very good , Ender . Thermal imaging from the satellite . The enemy is in red . What pattern do you see ? Seems random , but it 's not . There 's an epicenter right here ! Really ? You took out that one particular ship , and the rest just gave up ? Why ? To what animals are the Formics most often compared ? - Ants . - Which have .. ? A queen who directs the worker ants . What she thinks , they do . Without her , they can 't think for themselves And they die ! - You destroyed the Queen 's ship ? - I must have , yes . - But you can 't be certain ? - No . The Soviet Hegemon insisted we keep it classified . That 's why they never showed the rest of the battle . Or my face . To the world , I 'm dead . Colonel . Your face ? You mean why is it marked ? Father 's a Maori . Lost him in the war . " Tä moko " is a way to connect to my past , to my inner skin . It 's a way for me to speak for the dead . Sir ! - Have you ever seen a Queen ? - No . No one has . But if the Formics have rebuilt their fleet , there must be more than one Queen . Yes , of course on their home planet . What happened when you attacked here ? - Did you find one ? - No . Why did they come ? Water . Attention ! Officer on deck . - Hey Bean . - Ho Commander . Petra . We thought you were iced . We were gonna have to have Dink take over . That was never gonna happen . - Salaam , Alai . - Salaam , Commander . - Bernard . - Good to see you , sir . At ease . While you 've been skinny-dipping , the colonel 's been flogging us to death on the simulator . Alright , take your seats . In a matter of weeks , we may be called on to fight a real battle . Let 's bring your commander up to speed . Our latest probe images will give you an idea of what 's happening on the enemy planet . Like us , they appear to have a population growth rate that 's unsustainable . For now , they 're contained on their planet . But time is not on our side . Where are they ? High surface temperatures limit their above-ground activity to just a few hours a day . What 's most alarming , is the rate at which their military power is expanding . But they 've not yet moved against us ? No . They 're planning to colonize another planet , before they breed themselves into extinction . Our orders are to defeat them before they pose an irreversible threat . Their very existence is a threat . Is that clear , Commander ? - Clear , sir ! - Good . Carry on , Colonel ! We will begin with photo-real simulations that best approximate real battles . You will command overall strategy . Your toon leaders will each command a battle group . You will issue orders to them they will issue orders to their squadrons of drone pilots . Finally , your entire fleet must support protect your most important asset . $ 70 billion of pure destruction . The MD-500 which Petra is trained to fire . - MD ? - Molecular Detachment device . We call her the ' Little Doctor ' . Particle beams accelerate from her twin barrels . At the focus point , they reach critical effective mass . Chain reaction spreads outwards , shattering molecular bonds . Leaves nothing standing . That 's the beauty of the ' Little Doctor ' . No need to identify a specific ship for the Queen . The chain reaction takes out the entire swarm . But I 'll only get one shot . Once the Formics see how she works , they won 't come together again . You will have to win this war , one battle at a time . Once our battle fleet is detected entering the Formic solar system , we will have no alternative but to engage . I trust we have chosen our Commander well . - There 's greatness in him , sir . - And a killer instinct , too , I hope . Absolutely . Let 's hope he 's all you claim him to be . We 'll be with you soon . Good night . Good night , sir . " Dear Valentine , so this is Command School . I 'm finally here . Being a Third , I 've always been so afraid I might fail . That I might not measure up . But they made me a leader . And I promise you that I 'll do everything I can to win this war . I know if anything ever happened to you , I would never forgive myself . " What are they doing ? Harvesting water . If you 're gonna use me , I need to be closer . Too risky . Let 's not reveal our best weapon on what should be an easy attack . Alai , Bean ! Your droids peel away . Track them from below the ice and mirror their path . They 're swarming . They see us . Deploy all drones ! Give me four isobolic formations with 90 degree offsets ! Open fire ! Bean , Alai , on my count , fire directly up into the ice ! - Good strategy . In 3 ... 2 ... 1 , now ! As our training progresses , the simulations are becoming more and more complex , and real . The pressure to win , day after day , month after month , is intense . We get very little sleep . Some days it 's hard to keep up . - I got the breakaway ! - Great work , Bean . Squadrons 43 through 57 , switch to quadrant Foxtrot 3889 ! Ender , watch our right flank . We need backup for Bernard . I see it ! - Bernard , you flank them . - Copy that . Using 10 through 18 . Alai , peel right ! Dink , compensate for the pull of planet G8 and go full throttle ! Bean , mop-up in sector Sierra ! I got a swing left in Lima ! Do Sierra NOW ! Bernard , watch your speed ! Dink , you 're closing too fast ! - You said full throttle ! - Pull back now , Dink ! Gahh ! You can 't absorb these kind of losses ! War isn 't a game where you get to reboot and start over ! Sir , I can 't win if I don 't take any risks . Nobody 's saying not to take risks . Just don 't try and control everything . Let Bean improvise on the mop-ups , you focus on the big picture . Delegate more to your teams . My teams are burned out . How can they be effective if they don 't get any sleep ? Sleep deprivation is part of your training . A battle with the Formics could last for days ! If I 'd been smarter , I could have annihilated Petra 's Little Doctor while you were micro-managing Bean . That can 't happen , understand ? - Yes , sir . - Do you ? Cause I 've trained others . Each one so hopeful . Each one ultimately a failure . Alright , Colonel . He understands . - So I am not the first ? - No . But you will be the last . There 's no time to train anyone else . So tomorrow Colonel Rackham will run your final simulation . If I win tomorrow ? What happens ? You 'll be ready . To face the real enemy . And you 'll be the finest commander we 've ever trained . One more simulation , and I may have to go to war . What happens when it 's no longer a game ? Real war is different . I still know nothing about my enemy . What if they could talk to us ? - They can 't . Dissections show no vocal cords . - There are other ways to communicate . Ender , this is not a conversation we should be having at 1 a.m. What if they could ' think ' to one another ? What if we could ' think ' to them ? You need to sleep . We 've a graduation battle tomorrow . Right . - We 're gonna get crushed . - We won 't get crushed . We have you . Now go to sleep . - Goodnight Petra . - Goodnight Ender . You still think he 's the one ? We 're committed . This boy has the empathy to think like a Formic understand them , and anticipate them . He 's not ready . You 're never ready . You go when you 're ready enough . Easy , sir ! It 's Graduation Day . Good luck , sir ! Attention ! At ease ! Sir ? We have an audience . Commander Wiggin ! The Strategos is here today to witness your final simulation . If you are successful , he will endorse your promotion to Battle Commander of the entire fleet ! Yes , sir ! This simulation is staged around the enemy 's home planet . Good luck , Commander . Thank you , sir . Stay calm . Shoot straight . Here we go . - They 're waiting . - Maybe they think we come in peace . I don 't think Mazer intends for us to find a diplomatic solution . What 's he waiting for ? Just give him a minute . Ender , what do we do ? Ender ! The enemy 's gate .. is down . Petra , you 're up . They 're spread too wide for a chain reaction . - She 's right . - Just let him follow his instinct . All Battle Groups , deploy drones . Protect your carriers . Alai , you 're Squadron Five ! Engage ! This is suicidal ! Oh crap ! They 're swarming . Close enough for you now , Petra ? Once I fire , I need time to recharge . Understood ! Go for the center . Fire now ! - She did it ! - Yeah . Give me false color . We 're not done yet . - But we are so screwed ! - No , we 're not . - Charged , Petra ? - No . I need 2 minutes . - All fighters fall back and surround petra 's ship . - Copy that . I want rings within rings , layers upon layer , every fighter we have . - Ender , you 're gonna leave our transporters defenseless ! - If we 're gonna win this battle , Dink , it 's all or nothing now ! When the outer layer is hit , the rest will continue to drift with us like a shield . Do it now ! He 's abandoning his entire fleet ! He 's in command . There 's no stopping him now ! 90 seconds , Ender ! No , no , no ! I 'm losing my carriers ! My dreadnoughts are out ! I don 't care about dreadnoughts ! Just protect Petra ! Like we protected Alai when we fought Bonzo ! I hope you know what you 're doing . - Ready , Petra ? - In 60 seconds . What am I aiming for ? The planet . What ? We destroy the planet , we destroy the queens . Game Over . Ender , my targeting sensor needs a clear line of sight ! We will clear a path . All fighters maintain a clockwise rotation . Focus all firepower forward . - Ender , we 're entering the atmosphere ! - We need to slow down ! We can 't ! We 're one unit now ! We 're not equipped to handle the heat of passing through an atmosphere ! Our drones are our heat shield ! Keep falling . Let gravity do the work ! The shields won 't hold forever ! We don 't need forever ! 30 seconds ! I still don 't have a clear shot . We 're burning up ! Bean , on my count , accelerate the fighters from the nose of the formation in a continuous stream . - Yes , sir ! - Like bullets from a rifle , you will clear a visual for Petra ! We will drill a hole through the swarm . - Petra , you 'll only get a second . - That 's all I need . In 3 ... 2 ... 1 , now , Bean ! Shield integrity 's at 5 % ! Now , Petra ! Now ! - 7 seconds ! - They 've broken the shield ! Fire Petra ! We 're out of time ! We did it ! How about that ? Game over ! What 's he saying ? Restoring the ansible connection . What is this ? Why are we watching these images ? Ender . Thank you ! Brilliant ! Absolutely brilliant ! Thank God for you , son ! Why are these images in the program ? Ender we won ! What do you mean , ' we won ' ? I beat him ! He runs the simulations ! He said it was a game ! It was them or us , Ender . There was no other way . With this victory you 've won all future battles . You destroyed them ... for all of us ! - Stand down . Move ! Please ! Move ! - Make way . - Ender ... - STAY AWAY FROM ME ! You lied ! - Son , we were afraid if we told you , you 'd .. - What ? Refuse to play ? I 've killed an entire species They would have done the same to us - NO ! They waited ! - What were they waiting for ? - Who cares ! We lost a thousand men on the transporters you abandoned . I abandoned them in order to win ! - Yes ! And they died proudly for us ! - They might not have died at all ! - If I 'd known it was real , I would 've ... - What ? Called for a dialogue ? - They can 't even speak . - ... watched them ! What were they thinking ? Were they building an army for a second invasion ? - Or simply preparing to defend themselves ... from us ! - Ender , stop . They came to Earth to establish a colony . We chased them away . - And in fifty years , they never returned ! - It makes no difference now . I will bear the shame of this genocide , forever ! - No ! You will be remembered as a hero . - I will be remembered as a killer ! - It was us or them . - And you 're sure we 've killed every last one of them ? I saw their whole planet destroyed . How do you know there isn 't another colony or another Queen out there ? - Dammit , we won ! That 's all that matters . - No ! The way we win matters . Don 't hurt him . - Go on . You need to let him rest . - Can I stay with him ? Just so he 's not alone . Please . Yes , of course . C 'mon ! Let 's let him rest . What if they could talk to us ? What were they thinking ? Valentine ! What if we could think to them ? - Valentine ! - Ender ! Ender , wait ! Ender ! What are you doing , Ender ? - I know what she wants ! - Ender ? # Warning ! You are leaving an oxygen balanced environment . Ender , stop ! It 's not safe ! Ender ! Breathe . Just breathe . In my game , I saw this place . What are you talking about ? The Formics accessed the game through me . Their thoughts , my dreams , all mixed together . They were trying to communicate . What are you doing ? Go back . No ! Please ! I have to do this . " Dear Valentine , ... I now know my dreams were never my own . They came from her . She was always trying to communicate with me . I know the Formics better than any living soul . I stole their future from them . Now I must find a way to make amends . " You 're dying . Is it a Queen ? I 'll find her a new home . I promise . " I miss you , Valentine . You won 't be hearing from me for a while . I need to find out if I 'm as gifted at peace as I am at war . They 've rewarded me the rank of Admiral and left me to my own devices which suits me fine . I 'll travel the universe and carry with me , a precious cargo . Because I have a promise to keep . " Subs By AB69 , corrected resynced ♪ ♪ by AsifAkheirESL @ teachers.org

 Mr. Falk ? James Sandin . I talked to John over at repairs ... and he took care of it . It 's all fine The system is working without a hitch , you 're going to be locked in tight tonight . - Thank you , sir . - All right , Mr. Falk , safe night . - James Sandin 's Office . - Sue , I took care of Falk . What do you know ? You hear anything ? You 're number one , Mr. Sandin . You got it , sir . - You come out on top . - Thank you very much . Thank you . - Congratulations to you too , Susan . - You don 't have to say that . No , Susan , it 's a team win . Thank you . - Okay , safe night . - Safe night , Mr. Sandin . Radio : The poor can 't afford to protect themselves . - They are victims . - We all have our opinions . That is what makes this country great . Holly , line 4 . What 's are your Purge plans ? I 'm going to hide behind my new security system . Pete from Northern Virginia . What 's your Purge plans ? I 'm gonna hunt down my boss . That son of a bitch has it coming . Clearly more people will be purging this year than ever before . American streets will be running red tonight ... when people " release the beast " in record numbers . Mr. Cali ! - Getting in one last walk in before lockdown ? - Yes . Did you do the systems check I recommended ? - Of course , there are no problems . - OK , it 's the same one I use . I only sale the best . Nobodies bothering us tonight . Well , you have a safe night , Mr. Sandin . Thank you . Now don 't forget to buy your blue Baptisia 's , just wear those flowers proudly , OK ? Show your support for this important evening . A safe night to everyone . - McGander , McGangee , Jim Release the beast and Purge the streets ... Hey Honey , I 'm home ! Wife : I 'm in the kitchen . What a day ! What a day . Everybody is doing security checks . It 's crazy . Traffic is even worst than last year Something smells good . Great ! I 'll put them in the water , they look dry . - Where are the kids ? - In their room , of course . - We got about an hour before commencement . - Dinner isn 't going to be ready for a while ... OK , good . Well , I have to make a few phone calls . - One thing . - Yeah . Zoey 's is getting worse . She has been pouting all day . So , you 're gonna have to do something about the Henry situation . I can 't stand it . There 's nothing to do with her . He is 18 , he 's not getting any younger She is going to have to sulk , get over it But I have some good news for all of us . I 'll tell you at dinner . History has proven over and over again . We are a inherently violent species , Wars , genocide , murders , the denial of our true selfs is the real problem . The Purge not only contains societal violence to a single evening . But the countrywide catharsis creates a psychological stability ... by letting us release the aggression we all have inside of us . I love you . - Let 's growl . - What ? - Growl . - Why ? Because , everyone says I love you and it 's used ... and we need to find our own thing . - No ! I 'll look silly . - Come on . - No . - Do it . It 's our way of saying " I love you " . Try it . Seriously . I think my dad 's home . I 'm sorry , baby , but you have to get going . I 'm sorry . And you have to get home before lockdown . Come on . [ Growls ] - Really ? Someone is getting ready for tonight . Be careful . Mary ! I 'm so glad I caught you . I come bearing gifts . What have I done to deserve a gift , Grace ? I was baking and I made way too many cookies . Hi Grace ! - Hi ! - Ohhh cookies ! I hope you 're hungry . Those cookies are crazy good . They 're lovely . To have a safe night , ladies . - Bye ! - Goodbye ! Thank you , Grace . Just as I needed more cookies , right ? The new edition to your house . It 's just amazing . - Thank you . - You know not everyone is happy you build it , Mary . Whatcha you mean ? You know your husband sold a new security system to almost every home in this community . Some people are actually saying that ... this neighborhood paid for ... that new edition on your home . Are people really saying that ? Relax , it 's just some good ole neighbor gossip . Don 't worry about it . You 're too sensitive . So , are you having your annual party , Grace ? No , too much trouble . We just going to lockdown , and watch some Purge event special ... Thanks for the cookies . Goodnight . You 're welcome . - Have a safe night , Mary . - And you , Grace . Jesus . You scared me to death . You can 't keep creeping up on me like that , Charlie . So , quit playing with Timmy , and help me set the table . Okay ? Now . Christ ! Charlie , that 's twice today . You 're gonna give me a heart attack ? I 'm sorry , Mom . Check it out . I made some adjustments , look ! I installed a night vision program ... and I insulated this motor so you can now barely hear him . And you can now play music to accompany him on his missions . [ Playing : " Is he an Aussie , Is he Lizzie ? " , by Mr Flotsam and Mr Jetsam ] See ? - He like songs from olden times . - Mmm-hmm ... It 's very , very cool . What is it ? What 's bothering you ? It 's tonight , isn 't it ? Just remember all the good the Purge does , OK ? It 's all that matters . You hungry ? - A little bit . - Good . Tell you what , take Timmy away ... and come help me finish up . - OK ? - OK . Honey , this is so good . Isn 't it amazing ? And not one carb . Great . Well , I want like to hear about every bodies day . Zoey , you go first . Charlie , what are you doing ? Sorry , I forgot to take my vitals earlier . By the way , there is a slight deviation in the heart rate . But other than that ... - nothing to worry about . - Okay , thank you . Zoey , your day . I don 't want to do this anymore . It 's stupid . Great ! Fine . Pop test , piano , a normal day . - Who cares ? - I do . I care , very much . And what about practice ? Are you ready for your recital ? Of course you are , because you 're always ready to make sure ... your left hand cooperates in the third movement . I 'm not saying , that justs what I hear . Well , I can say what I did today ? I did it . All sales are final ... and I 'm on top . My division sold most upgraded security systems . - Congratulations , Dad . - Congratulations , baby . Thank you . It was a team effort , you know . All right , Charlie . You 're next . Well , we studied history of tonight in History . And in English I wrote a story about a man whose love was so powerful , that it can kill people . Cuts out his own heart . That is so sweet . You know he should have cut off his own penis . - Zoey ! - We 're eating dinner ! Zoey , that 's not funny ... - Don 't encourage her . - We 're trying to eat . We are not living in a dormitorium . - It 's just a story . [ Everyone talking at once ] Guys , look what time it is . Well , it 's later than I thought . Alright , it 's time to lockdown . Let 's go . - Hon , give that back . - Give it back . All right . Check this out . Mr. Sabean and Mr. Bapaora are going hunting this year . I didn 't know they were on a purge together . Are they friends ? The Ferrins are having a party . Grace said she wasn 't having a party this year . Just thank God we weren 't invited . She 's nice , but wow , she is annoying . Well , get ready for the night . As always , just for precaution . Alright , Mr. Cali has started to lockdown . OK . We ready ? Alright , let 's hit it . Okay , Charlie , it 's almost time . Hit it . TV : .. Release the beast and purge our American streets . Your new Founding Fathers encourage your participation . [ Emergency Broadcast alarm sounding off ] This is not a test . This is your emergency broadcast system . Announcing the commencement of the annual Purge sanctioned by the U.S. Government Weapons of Class 4 and lower ... have been authorized for use during the Purge . All other weapons are restricted . Government officials of ranking 10 ... have been granted immunity from the Purge . and shall not be harmed . Commencing of the sirens ... any and all crime , including murder , will be legal for 12 hours . Police , fire and emergency medical services ... will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. ... when the Purge concludes . Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America , a nation reborn . May God be with you all . [ Siren goes off ] [ Siren stops ] OK , kids , I know bad things do happen tonight , but we can afford protection , So , we 'll be fine , just like always . No worries , Okay ? Okay ? Can I go now ? I would prefer to be miserable in my room . Of course , and thank you for being here . - Charlie ... - Where are you going , bud ? Charlie ! Why don 't you guys kill ? Because we don 't feel the need too , Charlie . That 's all . So if you felt the need too , you would kill someone too ? Look , I know this is difficult to understand at your age , But tonight ... allows people a release ... for all the hatred , and violence , and aggression they keep inside . Okay , and ... Yes ! If your mother and I were so inclined we would participate . Because it works . You don 't remember how bad it was , Charlie . The poverty , all the crime . This night saved our country . Why don 't you go rest . We 're all done here . I 've got some paperwork here to process . To get my bonus . Maybe we should watch a movie later with the kids . Oh , Jesus , Henry . You scared the hell out of me . What are you doing here ? I wanted to surprise you . So , I snuck in here . Baby , you can 't be in here . My Dad would lose his mind if he sees you here now . Come on ... Aren 't you happy to see me ? Of course . TV : " We 're looking at a live feed from around the country , and discussing the Purge with criminologists , Tommy Ayeguard . Thanks , Nicole . Now is the Purge really about releasing aggression , and containing violence . Or is it something else ? Purge distracters often postulate it is about the elimination of the poor , the needy , the sick . Those unable to defend themselves . The eradication of these so-called ... non-contributing members of society . Consequently , unburdening the economy . Is the Purge really about money ? Anyway , crime is down . The economy is flourishing ... I can 't do this . - Did I do something ? - No , I ... It 's just ... I didn 't come to see you . - I came to see your father . - What ? - Why ? - To try and straighten this out . He cannot prevent you from seeing me . It 's crazy . It might be crazy , but he isn 't going to change his mind . He thinks you 're too old for me . Talking to him will only make him more angry ... and make it more difficult for us . I promise ... everything is going to be OK . TV : America was collapsing . A quadruple dip recession ... followed by a whole market crash . Skyrocketing debt , multiple awards , and significant dollar devaluation . All precipitating the worst economic disaster in the history of the United States . Crime and poverty rosed exponentially . And The New Founding Fathers just months after being elected ... came up with this audacious notion ... decriminalization of murder for one night . A lawful outlet for American rage . With the continual decline in crime , the undeniable fact is , this is working . [ Machine gun fire in the distance ] I thought I heard gun shots . A couple of streets back , maybe ? Well , gun shots are going to happen tonight , OK ? It nothing . It 's probably somebody just firing off a few rounds before going hunting . C 'mon , let 's go to relax . Hold on . Look , he can 't kick me out . He 's going to be forced to listen to what I have to say . I don 't know ... One on one , man to man . No BS . I 'm going to explain to him , sure I 'm older ... but you 're also very mature . So , age difference is not a problem . I 'll tell him how much I love you . Ten years ago we could barely afford rent , And now we are going to buy a boat . Crazy . This one has a car garage . Who needs a car on a boat ? Help me ! Someone please help me ! They 're coming after me ! Please ! Can anybody help me ? I ask you . I just need to get somewhere safe . Can anybody hear me ? I won 't hurt you ! I don 't want to die . I don 't deserve this . Why won 't anybody help me ? I need somewhere to hide . Please , somebody open a door ! They 're coming , they 're coming . Please ! They 're going to kill me ! Come here ! Let 's go ! This way ! Come on , hurry ! Hurry , hurry ! What the hell ? Charlie ! Charlie ! This way ! Hurry ! Go ! Go ! Faster ! What 's going on ? Mr. Sandin ? Jesse he has a gun ! Henry has a gun ! Henry ! Henry ! Oh , God ! Are you hit ? - Is Zoey alright ? I didn 't hit Zoey , did I ? - No , she 's fine . Zoey ! Zoey ! - Mom , what 's going on ? - Charlie ... Where is he ? Where is the man ? I don 't know . I don 't understand . Who is he ? Why did you let him in our home ? He was hurt . He called for help . No one was helping . Charlie , Jesus Christ , what the hell ? We have no idea what this man is capable of . James he 's gone , we don 't know what Henry might do ... we 're not safe here , and we don 't know where Zoey is . You 're right , let 's go . Come , come , come . Let 's go . Henry ! Henry , you 're ... Henry ! Why ? Henry ! OK . Here 's the plan . You two stay put here and I 'll just ... I 'll go out there , and I 'm going to find Zoey ... and I 'm going to bring her back here . - Henry tried to kill you . - Mary ... I 've got to make sure she 's OK . Okay ? I have too . He didn 't shoot me . I 'll find her . - I 'll go . - I can 't let you go ... with that man out there . OK , I can 't let you do that . Let me go get her . You just stay here with Charlie . - OK ? - You be careful , okay ? I will . Zoey ! Zoey ! Zoey ! Listen to me ! You okay , sweetheart ? Yeah . [ Zoey calling outside ] Charlie ! Mom ! Charlie you wait here , I will be right on the other side of the door . Baby ! Zoey ! [ Machine gun fire down the street ] Mom ? Zoey . Are you okay ? Is Charlie OK ? - Father all right ? - Everyone is fine . I didn 't know Henry was going to do that . I didn 't know that he wanted to kill him . - Why would he do that ? - Mom ? Charlie , give me a second ... . He 's died . Mom ? Charlie , give me a second . - Zoey , let 's see what Charlie wants . - Mom , now ! What is it , baby ? - You wanna see this . - Tell Dad that I 'm sorry . Zoey ! Zoey ! Henry is dead . I killed him . I know , I saw Zoey . - Is she OK ? She alright ? - She 's not hurt . I couldn 't get her to come with me . What are we going to do ? I have to show you something . Oh , god . Now that one is saying something . Good evening , Mr. Sandin . Your home tells me that you are good folks , just like us . One of the haves . And the blue flowers tell me that you support the Purge . We willing to treat you fairly , so , listen closely . Let me introduce us ! We are some fine , loyal , very educated , guys and gals . We have gotten gussied up these terrifying disguises ... as we do every year ... ready to violate , and annihilate , to cleanse our souls . But things took a turn . Our target escaped us , and ... So , one of your good neighbors informed us that you ... the Sandin 's ... have inexplicably given him sanctuary . The man you shelter is nothing but a dirty , homeless pig . A good testimony of a just society who has audacity to fight back . Killing one of us as we attempted to execute him tonight . The pig doesn 't know his place , and now he needs to be taught a lesson . We need you to return him to us . Alive . So that we may Purge as we are entitled . Here 's the plan , Sandins ! You have to provide us with permission to break into your home . If you don 't ... If you don 't , we 're going to come in and release the beast on him And on you . And ah ... We can enter any home we want . And we will want ... As long as we want on this fine night . Don 't force us to hurt you . We don 't want to hurt one of our own . Please , just let us Purge ! Toodaloo , Sandins . Cut it , cut it now ! C 'mon , let 's work on the back-up . The powers down over the whole house . They can 't get here , right ? They can 't get into our house . I don 't know , it 's hard to say . You don 't know ? You sell these security systems . What do you mean you don 't know ? We have tested the system . It works 99 % of the time . It looks good . It 's strong , it keeps people away . It looks good . It 's not built for worst case scenarios . It is impenetrable ? No , nothing is impenetrable . Things like this are not suppose to happen in our neighborhood . But they are happening , James . They 're happening right now . Do you see this ? Listen , sit down , just sit down . Please , we 've got to calm down . Okay , sit down , sit down , listen . To answer your question , Yes , they could get into here . OK , they could tunnel underneath us . They could smoke us out . Improvise a battering ram . OK , I 'm sorry , but it 's true . So , here 's what we 're going do . We 'll gonna give them what they want . We 'll find that man And we 're gonna force him outside . Now ... we have guns ... And he doesn 't . But they 'll kill him . Why should he die ? It 's either him or us , Charlie . [ Girls outside taunting , shooting guns ] I bet the boys won 't let us go inside . Not killing anyone wouldn 't be any fun , please ! Fuck ! Where is he ? There he is . Look at me . Come on , look over here . Where are you ? Come on ! Polite Leader : Hey , Mr. Sandin ! Sorry to interrupt , but I must have a word . Anybody at the front door ? I just need a moment of your time . [ Knocks on door ] There you are . Thank you for accepting my invitation . Tell me , why haven 't you delivered the filthy swine yet ? Are you protecting him ? I certainly hope not , Mr. Sandin . No , of course not . I just can 't find him . You see , this is a misunderstanding . My son let him in , he 's a young boy who doesn 't know better . But I support what occurs here tonight , 100 % . OK ? I sell security equipment . So , I would never deny yours or anybodies else 's right to Purge . You see ... Give us the homeless pig , you fuck ... Sorry about that . I don 't condone that kind of behavior . Just keep in mind , Mr. Sandin ... he was my friend , and you are not . Our equipment is arriving soon . And we will get him . Soon after that ... we will need him . - I 'll go get him . - You should do that . Hey , Charlie . I don 't know what going on here . There are people outside . Henry is dead . I 'll be OK , I have his gun . Stay where you are . Please be safe , okay ? I 'm gonna go hide in your secret spot . No . I love you . Don 't . Zoey ? Get back . Into the hall . Let 's go . Drop your gun . Dad , please . Drop it . Don 't hurt her . Zoey , I will not let him hurt you . Leave her alone . No , you son-of-a-bitch . I will let her go when this night is over . You 're gonna get us all killed , you know that They 're going to come in here , and they are gonna kill us all . They are coming here ! You have got to leave my family out of this , OK ? If you don 't drop your gun , I will hurt her . - and I will hurt you . - We didn 't do anything to you . - I don 't deserve this . - I don 't deserve this , either . Now listen , I don 't want to hurt any of you . But I am " NOT " dying tonight ! Drop the gun , please . Drop it . Please . Listen to me , okay ? You are going to die tonight . And you can either you die like a man and walk outside there by yourself ... or you can die like a coward , And get my wife and my children killed along with you . OK ? So , take that gun away from my daughter 's head . Shoot it , Mary ! Shoot it ! Oh , shit . Mary ! Mary ! Zoey ! She 's unconscious . Okay . Okay . - We gonna need some rope . - What ?

 The story says that it started with three men - Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines . They formed an alliance . Oswald , I - run as fast as you can . You 've got the most famous face on the planet . Where are you gonna hide ? From this moment on Torchwood is defunct . You will be removed from American soil immediately and God help Great Britain . Hey , stop . I said stop . Jack ! Day 61 of the Great Depression . The government has announced that all medical overflow camps will now stay open . Under the new emergency laws , Category 1 patients must be taken for disposal . Campaigners have called this institutional murder . Go now or I will put a hole in your head . Can you spare me some of those Metanec things ? - What ? - Metanec . Just a couple of boxes . My wife 's suffering something wicked with the arthritis . She 's scared to go to the doctors because of the rumors . They say Huw Jenkins has gone up in smoke and all he had was a bad back . Help yourself . Hurry up , we haven 't got long . Go , get out of here . - Thank you . - Go . Okay , relax . She 's back . She 's only been for pizza . Hey . Oh , beautiful . Nice one . Right . That 's for the Reynolds and the Llewellyns . Oh , and Iris Price called by . She was looking for painkillers . She gets a bloody headache and expects to go to the top of the list . Tell her she can have them if she pays double . That 's the same policy as Phicorp . Thanks for that . Thanks a lot . Here we are . Careful now . Make yourself useful , you big lump . - So what 'd you get ? - Diamorphine . That 'll do the trick . Come on . Okay ? This won 't last a week the way he 's going through it . Don 't worry . I 'll get some more . You okay , Dad ? You 'll be happy as Larry in a minute now . Smiling away . Poor sod . He 's missing his bed . It 's too risky upstairs . I know . But whenever we went away , the first night back he always used to say you can 't beat your own bed . Well , we can 't be too careful , Mom . It was only yesterday there was a raid on Oystermouth Road . They took two people away for the ovens . I used to arrest people for selling that stuff . It 's practically heroin . Strange days , sweetheart . Much better . The infection is almost gone . Yeah , the gunshot didn 't kill me . But I think you will . I 'll go into the village tomorrow , see if I can buy a steak , get you some iron . As long as they don 't start asking questions again . That last guy creeped me out . If he 's still there , I think we should move on . We 're in Scotland . We can 't go much further north . Yes we can . Keep running for as long as it takes . I remember when you were too scared to leave home . Yeah , a long time ago . You were the strong one standing tall . Look at you now . And now you 're a vampire . More like a gunsmith . Closest thing to a weapon we 've got . Esther , my blood isn 't magic . It didn 't make me immortal . They can 't have cloned it or copied it . All the same , Jack , they took your blood and they keep trying to spill your blood . Someone wants you dead for a reason . And I think this stuff is the only hope we 've got . The answer 's got to be here somewhere . The Blessing , page 56 of 12 million . God , I need Esther . I 've had a job offer driving for Matty Sheldon . Oh . That 's good , isn 't it ? He 's got the contract for the overflow camps . I 'd be driving Category 1s . Well , it 's not your fault . We need money . I won 't take them to the ovens , just the camps . I know , yeah . It 's funny , isn 't it ? When they first opened the camps we all protested . Second time we 're all too busy looking after ourselves . Aye . All part of the plan - to wear us down . Yeah , but what is the plan ? What 's it all for , Rhys ? Oh great . That 's just what I needed . That 's ... bollocks . You know , there was power cuts in the ' 70s . Nine months later there was a baby boom 'cause people took advantage of the dark . Oh yeah . Here , this could be the one piece of paper that we need . Come on , focus , people . Let 's go , come on . Let 's go . Hey , you been here all night ? Don 't you have a home to go to ? Not anymore . She left me , remember ? Oh shit . Yeah , sorry . 'Cause of the hours which you imposed . I know . I forgot . But look , if you 're gonna be here anyway , why don 't you clean this place up a little bit ? Empty out some trash bins or something . Really ? Sir , I should tell you that smoking is still illegal inside . It can 't kill you . Not anymore . But they still haven 't changed the building 's insurance . Insurance companies went bust along with half the western world . Oh , did I tell you ? Gas allowances have been halved . You are way over limit . What do you expect me to do , walk to work ? Hey , don 't complain to me . Recession became depression . We 're all being rationed , even the C.I.A. Okay . Well , since you 're too busy housekeeping you probably won 't be interested in this . - What is it ? - A lead . All right , it 's 1928 . There 's a guy hanging in the cellar of the Giordano butcher shop and they 're selling tickets for $ 2 . You can watch him get killed and come back to life again . So who knows if it 's a miracle or he 's Harry Houdini ? Either way , it 's news . So plenty of people wrote about it . Yeah , but that 's where the records disappear . I 've told you , Ablemarch , Costerdane and Frines - they went through the archives . They scrubbed them clean . Look at this place , Rex . We have tried . According to the census in 1930 the population of Manhattan was 1,867,000 . That 's more people than live there now . Allow for an average of two children per family across three generations by 2011 we 're looking at a potential six million descendants . That 's six million suspects . We have to find and interview six million people . So do you see ? That proves my point . You 're looking too close at the facts . - What else should we be looking at ? - Fiction . Look , I 'll trade you six million people for one short story . Because the London office , they found a story . It was published in 1935 - " The Devil Within . " Now it 's just Pulp Fiction - it 's all blood and Satan and that kinda shit - but it contains five points of reference identical to the Harkness case , which is more than a coincidence . Now I believe the author was in that cellar . He saw Jack Harkness die , decided to write about it . And his name was Victor Podesta . Then we follow the Podesta family . Oh , sir , this is where it gets interesting . You see , the Podestas owned a grocery store about 10 blocks east of the butcher shop and they had connections to organized crime . Now the youngest son John was stabbed to death back in ' 27 . Unsolved , mob related . But check this out , now we jump to 1938 . The whole family just disappears . I mean all of them - mom , pop , Victor , daughter Emmeline . Just all gone . Look , maybe the Podestas changed their name . Who knows ? Maybe Emmeline married into the three families . We could look for a marriage license . And where would we check that ? The Manhattan Central Repository ? Damn it , every time . The most effective thing they did was burn that place down . Yeah , and that was 1965 . I mean everywhere we turn this conspiracy spans the whole of the 20th century . People , come on . This is me you 're talking to , remember ? You 're forgetting about the younger brother , the murder of John Podesta , unsolved . This is where we got lucky . The case was bagged , tagged and locked away just sitting on a shelf collecting dust for almost 90 years . We still have the murder weapon . With blood on it ? Is that blood ? We have blood . We have D.N.A. We can trace the family . All right , everybody . Let 's make a D.N.A. profile and start looking for matches . Good job . Come on , let 's go . Let 's go . Group up , start working . - Uh hey , Rex . - Yeah ? I 've got Jordan and Carlyle . They were exceptional with the O 'Grady D.N.A. Remember ? And they 're fast . Want me to use them on this ? Sure thing . Do what you 've got to do . Thank you for coming . This is not the promotion I expected , sitting in a nondescript office distributing for Harry Bosco . I thought you needed me . This is for you . You 've been invited to Shanghai . Well , that 's impossible . Don 't you watch the news ? First sign of the meltdown , China closed its borders . Not to us . This says Lucy Statten Meredith . You 'll be traveling under that name . In fact , that is your name from now on . But the families want to meet you in person . It 's one way ? Yes , yes it is . I 'm rather jealous . They 're taking you to The Blessing . Thank you . We won 't meet again . It 's them . They 're here . Remember , just do what we said . Take it upstairs and flush it . Yes , I 'm coming . If you don 't open the door , we 're legally empowered to knock it down . - Mrs. Cooper ? - Mm-hmm . You must be Gwen Cooper . - Ralph Finch . Can we come in ? - Not without a warrant , no . Not necessary , I 'm afraid . I have reason to suspect you may be illegally harboring an unsupported Category 1 deceased person . And according to the Emergency Powers Act , reasonable suspicion is all I need . You keep an eye on the front . Gentlemen , we 're in . Oh , I 'm gonna complain . I 'm gonna take this to the top . Just wait and see . I used to be with the police . Very much in the past tense as I understand it . Up you go , boys . Check the rooms upstairs . My father is dead . He 's gone . We never said goodbye . No funeral . No chance to mourn him . For all I know he was just thrown into a furnace still alive . I can 't even have a bit of peace in my own bathroom . You allowed to barge in like this anyway ? Husband , Rhys Williams . You never shared his surname , which says a lot . But we 're still missing one person . So where 's Mary , Gwen ? What 's keeping your mother so busy ? Shopping . - No lights ? - Uh , no . Whole house needs rewiring . No worries . We 've got torches . Boys , torches down here . Lend us your torch , Joe . All that 's down there is rats , so you make yourself at home . Shut up . It 's mice , not rats . I 'd recommend putting down traps . We 'll get rid of the vermin as fast as we can . Out . Your father is still unregistered . And I can 't leave you alone until I know what happened to him . So you take care now . Seriously , your whole family , you 'd better take a great deal of care . - God , that was close . - Never mind . I told you this thing would work . I had to pin him down . It took all my strength . It 's okay . They 've gone . They 've gone . Bad news . The D.N.A. trace , it came out negative . No leads , nothing . There 's no bloodline from John Podesta on file . - I tried everything . - Shit . - Son of a bitch . - Sorry . I 'll keep looking , but ... Hey , Charlotte . The Podesta short story , we have that on digital format , right ? - Yeah , I think so . Why ? - Great , can you send it to me ? It 's not worth reading . Like you said , Pulp Fiction . I know , but just send it to me . You have an idea ? No no no . Just send it , okay ? Sure . It 's the shopping . Take it through to the kitchen , will you ? - Hey . - All right , mate ? Oh , you 're early . Just put it by the fridge . I 'll sort it out in a minute . It is posh getting deliveries made . It 's my mother 's latest scheme . She 's starting to cook for the club , raising money charging two quid a cake . Oh , isn 't she pretty ? Are you eating that food , honey , or are you wearing it ? Mm , sweet . So sweet your child . I realize this might be something of a surprise ... What 's going on ? I 've been told that you have certain information that I need . I apologize for the subterfuge , but I do happen to have the most recognizable face on the planet . Not anymore . - What the hell are you doing ? - Look at him , for God 's sake ! Look at him ! Look at him ! - It 's Oswald Danes in our house . - Oh my God ! You touch my daughter again and I will kill you . Take her out of here , Mom , now . Good , thank you . Because I don 't want her to see her mother - Stop it ! Stop stop stop . Stop right there . Hush now . Come on . We don 't want you arrested for murder . - Thank you , sir . - They can arrest me for that . Now you tell me . Tell me quickly , you bastard . You murdering bastard ! Come on . Tell me before I get the boys round . Before I shout your name out loud in the street and fetch the bloody mob , tell me what do you want ? Jack Harkness . The men who smuggled me into this country , they brought Harkness in seven weeks ago and they brought him to you . And then you in turn found him a haven . Now I paid good money for your name , Gwen Cooper . So I really need to see Jack . And you will do exactly what I ask . Why should I ? Because I have a name . I have the name of a man . I have the name of the man who created the miracle . Look , someone is leaking information . You know that 's got to be true . Maybe not from here , but from somewhere down the chain . For the past two months , every move we make we get blocked . Yeah well , I wish it were me . Then you could shoot me and I could sleep . Yeah , I 'd like that very much , sir . So what did you find ? Victor Podesta . I figured anyone who writes Pulp Fiction is gonna want to keep on writing even if it 's under a different name . So I ran the short story through the pattern recognition software identifying key points of similarity in prose styles . - Did you find him ? - I found 320 . See , it 's more difficult with that sort of fiction because everyone writes the same . And that 's only the ones in the database . But out of that there 's around 46 with pronounced similarities scattered all across the world . Look at this - 22 in the U.S. , nine in the U.K. , one in Sweden . We 've got Argentina , Germany , Japan . And I 've got to check them all out . Well , I think you 'd better get started . Yes sir . But listen , can we keep this between you and me ? I mean this has to be mine and mine alone . Okay ? The latest from the White House is that they 're gonna stop all immigration . China closed its borders , now we 're gonna do the same . Every passing day we are taking one step closer to a dictatorship . And we don 't even know who the real dictators are . Hello ? Can you see my car keys ? I can 't find them anywhere . Uh , how did you get this number ? Look , whoever you 're working for , it 's Jack Harkness they 're after . So you 're wasting your time . He wouldn 't turn up here in a month of Sundays . So why not just take the night off ? - Do you think we 're stupid ? - Yeah . Now drink this . It won 't harm you . You 've had it before . It 's true . I made you drink it . I need you to have no memory of seeing me , so I can leave you with nowhere to put your hat , or you can drink it . Option two is better . Oh my God . Oh my God . - Oh my God . - I know . Oh ! Sorry . I thought you were better . I 'm fine . I am , don 't worry . Thank you for looking after him . Thank you . It 's so good to see you . Oh God , I missed you . I have so missed you . He 's through there . Jack . I was told the correct form of address is Captain . You once asked me for help . So you can remember that , the rest of you , the Captain invited me in . I want to ask one thing first . At your trial you said about that girl , " She should have run faster . " Did you really say that ? Yes I did . Right . 'Cause let me tell you , Oswald , I used to be a policewoman and I worked with pedophiles and murderers , and God help me , I saw men so alone and damned and wretched . But that 's not you . That 's nothing like you . Because for the first time in my life I 've met a monster . Is that clear ? I feel very special . And well said . - I 'm gonna kill him . - Leave it . Okay , everyone , all we need is information . Tell us what you know . And what happens to me after that ? Then we kill you . Don 't forget , there 's no murder anymore . So I can make you Category 1 forever , pal . I haven 't agreed to anything . So you just tell me what you know or we are calling the police now . You 're keeping a few secrets yourself , Gwen . You had me tied up here all day , and all those whispers , all those looks towards that cellar . Are you hiding something down there by any chance ? Excuse me . You were gonna call the police . Okay , there may be deals to be made . There may not . But before we can decide anything , there needs to be a full and fair exchange of information . Mr. Danes , there 's no going back . You need to tell us what you know . I 'll say this : Phicorp gave me an assistant , a woman called Jillian Kitzinger . And in my crate over there I have Miss Kitzinger 's laptop . God 's sake , is that it ? We raided her file way back . Wait a minute . Wait wait . As soon as I 'd stolen the laptop , good little Jilly did exactly the right things . She changed the passwords , opened new accounts , deleted the old ones . But I was watching . And I know my way around online better than most . I know how to keep myself hidden . So I shadowed her , and I 've been following Miss Kitzinger these past two months . Here 's a funny thing . Yesterday at 12 : 00 midday she disappeared . Her entire profile online vanished . Jilly Kitzinger ceased to exist . You said you had the name of a man . Soon as I say this I 'll be at your mercy . - Yes . - Tell us his name . I 'll have to trust you . Remember that . I 'm trusting you . One man 's name keeps reoccurring . Kitzinger was employed to send him information . And his name 's Harry Bosco . Harry Bosco ? His name over and over again . Esther , Harry Bosco . - Sorry . - Can 't you search him ? You think you 're clever , Oswald ? Is that really all you had ? It 's a name . Harry Bosco isn 't a man . Harry Bosco is a process . It goes back to Vietnam . It was the first war to be televised and the government didn 't want U.S. networks taking feed directly from the vietnamese 'cause for the first time information was beyond their control . So they put agents into every newsroom , every major TV network , filtering the output for the public . Cleverest of them all was a man called Harry Bosco . What did he do ? He 'd alter information . It was subtle . He did it by mistranslation . He couldn 't censor or change , but he could manipulate the English translation . Change one word , change the entire meaning . If you say victims instead of bodies , you influence public opinion . All the channels Harry Bosco these days . So that 's it ? Dead end ? Done ? You finished with him ? Can I have him now ? Could you keep your dog on his leash ? - Watch it , pal . - My point still stands . The name 's still important because Kitzinger works in P.R. Why would she be handling this Harry Bosco process ? To be fair , it 's a good question . Why would the families hire Jilly to do all this in the first place ? - What 's she translating ? - What 's she mistranslating ? 'Cause the three families changed their name , now Jilly 's changing words ? Maybe they 're connected . Chicken and chips . Didn 't have any fish . Too expensive . World gone mad . - And I 've got the beers . - Can I have mine ? Oh , sure . Hey , they 've been going great guns , this lot . You know , going through someone 's email is like reading their diaries . So what did we find ? Another problem . Jilly processed this clip from a local news station in Shanghai . It 's got three layers of language . It 's in the local wu dialect dubbed into Mandarin and then she sent it out for English subtitles . How are we supposed to know what 's wrong or right ? What , nobody speaks Chinese ? Shut it ! What do we do ? I can 't go down to the takeaway and ask Kenny . Esther ? Yeah , I know . - What ? - Rex . It 's me . It 's Esther . Don 't tell anyone , but I need your help . I 'm sorry there 's no one else I can turn to , but I 've got a lead . All right , people , come on . I need this room . Top priority . Come on , clear the room . Let 's go , let 's go . - Where are you ? - Can 't say , so don 't make me . We 're safe . We 're fine . We 're okay . Well , if that 's the plural , I take it that World War II didn 't die . It 's gonna take more than that . I 've been trying to kill the silly sod for years . Okay , so that 's Gwen . Which means you 're in Wales . So much for undercover work . You know , you 're idiots . I didn 't even have to trace you . Except you 're not tracing us anyway , are you ? No , I 'm not . We need help , Rex . We need the C.I.A. We need translations specifically . Oh shit . Um , okay , I 'll try . - Can 't tell them why . - Oh , I know , believe me . This place isn 't safe . What 's the language ? Mandarin . We think there 's something in Shanghai . Morning . Guess you 're my breakfast meeting . I 'm Jilly Kitzinger . No , you 're Lucy Statten Meredith . Congratulations , you failed the test . Okay , I keep wondering , why me ? You 're a storyteller . - Thank you . - Look at you . The nails , the coat , the lipstick - from the moment you walk through the door , you tell a story . You might have noticed we 're kind of good at keeping quiet . So we need you . We need experts . So what 's your story ? I 'm the latest chapter in an epic . Once upon a time there were three wise families . Then they went out into the world . One family took politics , one family took finance and one family took media . But that 's all in the past . The stories yet to come , they 're the best . So does that mean there 's a story about to break ? - With the miracle ? - Not for me to say . You want me to what ? Prepare a statement ? Mount a campaign ? That 's kind of small , don 't you think ? Then what ? We need you to write history . I can do that . Good . Nice recovery . Your hair is a work of art . If you ever come here at night , try the mitten crab . It 's a local delicacy . So what do you want me to do next ? Stay in your hotel and wait . When we 're ready you 'll be taken to The Blessing . I hope you survive . I 'm sorry , what do you mean by that ? Well , some people die . The Blessing , it kills them . Good luck . You won 't see me again . This is pre-miracle . He died two days later . But he went crazy , burned down a hospital , got caught in his own fire . This guy should win the Darwin award . - Godsend , you got that , Rex ? - Yeah yeah yeah . I saw it first . I knew it . The English isn 't godsend . The actual phrase is " It 's a blessing my life was saved . " - Blessing . - He said blessing . It doesn 't mean anything . We 'd all say that . - He survived a fire . - Hold on , hold on . Would somebody shut the husband up , please ? That 's the Mandarin . But the original wu dialect is different . Are you ready for this ? He didn 't say , " It 's a blessing my life was saved . " He said , " The Blessing saved my life . " They mistranslated it on purpose . " The Blessing saved my life . " - It 's in Shanghai . - The Blessing 's in Shanghai . - How the hell do we get to Shanghai ? - Oh for God 's sake . - You 're not serious . - They hid the word blessing , Rhys . It wasn 't hidden from the bloody Chinese . They saw it and there 's enough of them . But it was only transmitted once and then it was scrubbed off the record . Yeah , just because he said blessing doesn 't mean it 's in Shanghai . I mean I could say Jesus , but I 'm not in Jerusalem . Why did they hide that clip ? Now stop it . Hush , okay ? The trouble is getting into Shanghai is gonna be impossible . They 've closed the borders , withdrawn from the u . N. I mean the whole of China is a no-go area . Yeah , and there 's no way I can get in without posting it as a full-scale mission . And that 's gonna leak . By the time we 'd get there they 'd be gone . - You could take a slow boat . - Shut it ! Wait a minute , who was that ? Who else is there ? Just Rhys . Never mind . Esther , is there anything within mainland China ? Any open ports ? Anything ? No but - wait . I knew a man once way back , worked out of Hunan Province . Wait wait wait , just listen . Okay , think about it . Who burns down a hospital ? I mean who does that ? Why would he do that ? Turns out we 've got another mistranslation . The Mandarin says medical facility , but I looked up the address . It was a blood bank . Blood again . It 's always about blood . Why is that ? Wait wait . Okay . Run a check on that , but reference it with Kitzinger . She has a second clip in Spanish . There 's a second blood bank in Buenos Aires . A blood bank destroyed by fire 24 hours before Shanghai , five days before the miracle . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . I had Argentina . Right there . John Forester died age 76 in La Boca . I think he was in the cellar with Jack . But that man said miracle in Shanghai , yes ? And why 'd they burn down a blood bank in Buenos Aires ? I mean why burn down a blood bank at all ? We don 't even know what The Blessing is . Maybe it 's some sort of ritual . Maybe it happens in both cities at once . Whoa , hang on a minute . - Rhys , my dad ! - Come on . Copy that ! - All clear ! All clear ! - Hello ? - Hello there , Gwen . - Hello . Got company ? Yeah , we 're just visiting from London . Don 't worry . Anyone who can leave the house under their own steam is of no interest to me . What 's going on ? Been busy down there , Rhys ? No . Well , you won 't mind if I take a look then . In the old days to find a dead body you 'd use a sniffer dog . But they 've gone the way of the miner 's budgie . Brand new app - thermal imaging . Brilliant it is . - Sorry , hold up there . - This is my house . My name is Mary Cooper and I live here . For God 's sake , let me in . This is good . I 'm the most wanted man on the face of the Earth , but they want someone else . One more word out of you and I 'm handing you over . But you can 't . Because then they 'll wonder who you are . We 've got him . Over there , boys . Behind the wall . Pull it down . He 's not dead . He 's not dead . Feel him , he 's still warm . He 's - he 's warm . Feel him . Not as warm as he 's going to be . Oh , you bastard . Please don 't , okay ? Please don 't . - This man is Category 1 . - Please please . It is my duty to take him from this place and deliver him into safe keeping until such time as he can be disposed of according to the laws of the land . Please don 't . I 'm sorry for your loss . Goodbye , my love . - What do you want to do ? - Go to Shanghai . I don 't care if we have to walk . I will travel the whole bloody world to put this right , Jack . I need your permission to go off grid , sir . Failing permission , I 'm going anyway . And I need to go now . Okay . What if you need backup ? Well , then and only then will I contact you , sir . Minimum notice . Because if we 've got a mole , I can 't risk anyone finding this out . But this could be it , sir . This could be The Blessing . - Good luck . - All right . I think I can get us in . Back in the old days , Torchwood tracked down a black market trade in alien artifacts coming out of China . Skullion metal and coins , things like that . We closed it down but the route stayed open - for arms dealing . - We 're gonna trust arms dealers ? - I don 't care . I 'll do it . - Okay okay , wait . What about Buenos Aires ? I don 't know . Which city is it ? It 's both , you bunch of nuts . You can 't see for looking , can you ? Here look . Right , Shanghai ... Buenos Aires . Shanghai . Opposite sides of the world . Quite literally , opposite sides of the Earth , yeah ? Yeah ? So whatever 's going on , there 's got to be something connecting them . Are you kidding me ? Is that right ? They 're antipodes . They 're the antipodes of each other . Two massive population centers balanced on either side of the planet . As the old saying goes , " Count your blessings , 'cause it turns out there 's two of them . " - But what does it mean ? - Look at the Phicorp logo . The letter phi - a circle with a line through it . It 's been right there in front of us staring us in the face all this time . - A line through the world ? - The Blessing . - The miracle . - But what is it ? We need to find out . We can get into Argentina no problem . Maybe we need to get into both , Jack . - Maybe you should go one way . - And you the other . - Buenos Aires . - Shanghai . So this is what we 're doing ? A mission on both sides of the world ? Biggest mission yet . - Suppose it is , yeah . - And you 're taking me with you . - No way . - No no no . I 've got better plans for you , bub . And that 's your problem , isn 't it , Gwen ? You can 't let me walk free . Not a man with my desires . And you can 't have me arrested . Not now that I know all about your little plans . They can leave you here with me . That 's just it , you joyous man . You 've just trapped your wife completely . Leave me here with him and I think he would . I actually think he would . Your husband would kill me . He 'd make me Category 1 with his own bare hands . You would kill me , wouldn 't you ? Is that what you want ? No . I 'm coming with you . There 's no choice . There 's not a choice in the whole of the world . Okay ? Hup ! Let 's go . It made it . The only way to get this stuff through was in the diplomatic bag . Oh man . Don 't start with that hugging shit . - Shut up . - Come on . The only problem is I had to sign for the case . Now I 'm running this thing undercover , but if anyone checks the embassy notifications , we 're screwed . You must feel terrible . No , I 'm fine . No , I mean you really must . That 's what The Blessing does to you the closer you get . You 're scared . Am I right ? Your skin 's a little too tight . There 's something just out of the corner of your eye you can 't quite see . Hmm ? Yes . You never get used to it . Come this way , Miss Kitzinger . It 's Miss Meredith . I don 't really care . The men enjoy those sorts of games . But the feeling , it started as soon as we dug deep enough . I think it 's The Blessing 's attempt to communicate . Then it 's a living thing ? Oh , we have no idea . But certainly The Blessing sends some sort of impact back at the onlooker . We have a theory . We say The Blessing shows you to yourself . I 've seen people look upon The Blessing and end their lives . There 's a brilliant truth about that because each and every time that person was hiding something vile . Isn 't that wonderful ? It 's exhilarating , the damage it does . I wonder what you 'll see . What can you see ? What does The Blessing tell you about yourself ? That I 'm right . How far down does it go ? All the way to the other side of the world . Hey . Guess what . Same old glamour here . We 're in some kind of warehouse . Yeah well , I 'm stuck in a hovel owned by gun runners with Oswald Danes as a roommate . Not the best day in my life , I 'll tell you . Still , it 's a good phone line . Yeah , considering the distance it is . Just started looking for that blessing . God help us . We 're in two of the biggest cities on Earth . Try starting with the family of that arsonist . I 'm gonna go to a local library . You look after that weapon , okay ? Jack 's blood , it 's got to be important . It 's safe . Got it here . - Find anything , call me . - You too . - Good luck . - Bye . Idiot . You idiot . You told me that was healed . You 're not better at all , are you ? Let me see . - Sorry . - It 's okay . I got you . Okay , I got you . I got you . - I 'm so sorry . - It 's all right . Don 't be sorry . I 've got you . Let me take a look . Oh , honestly . - Oh God . - Gwen . If I had known it was this bad , Jack , you 'd never have come . It got worse when we arrived . - Ah ! - I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Fine place to die , in old Shanghai . You 're not dying . Don 't say that . I 'm tired , Gwen . This mortal life , it hurts so much . Well now . Can 't say I 've been to China before so I 'm not well versed in their customs . But I 've got to say ... I never knew about that . Whoa . Whoa whoa whoa . It 's your blood . No wonder it 's killing you . I think - I think it 's showing us the way . It 's The Blessing . It 's somewhere over there . And I think whatever it is , it 's calling you , Jack .

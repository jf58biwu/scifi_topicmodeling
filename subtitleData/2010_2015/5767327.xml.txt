 I saw a girl kill herself . - Ew ! - Yeah , and she looked exactly like me . We 're clones , we 're like lab rats in an illegal experiment . If it were my experiment , I would put an observer close to the subject to keep tabs and accumulate data . - Where is Beth ? - She killed herself . I took her identity . You 're her monitor , aren 't you ? Doctors came and medically examined her in her sleep . I know exactly who you are , you 're a sleazy watcher spy . Aynsley ? If the German was sick , should I be worried about that ? I 'm all psyched up for you now . Art , you gotta see this . It 's a match on the Jane Doe print . Why the hell does she look like Beth ? Sarah Manning ! Put your hands on your head ! You 're under arrest . - I didn 't kill her , Art . - You know who did ? Detective , this interview 's over . This is Amelia . I 'm your birth mother . I had twins , one to the street - and one to the church . - Helena . I grew up pure in a convent in Ukraine . You killed someone I 've been dreaming about my whole life . Sarah Manning . My name is Rachel Duncan and we are going to come to terms . Sarah , you can 't make a deal . Any freedom they promise is bullshit . They patented us . Sarah , they could claim Kira . Kira ! - Pick up , pick up . - Leave it for Felix . Fe ... Shit ! Fe , where are you ? They took them . They took Kira and Mrs S. You look like you could use a coffee . Yeah , I 'll take tea . Tea it is . The number you have reached - is not in service at this time . - Shit ! The number you have reached is not in service at this time . Hi , you 've reached Paul Dierden , please leave a message . Paul , what the hell is going on ? Did Racheljust take my family ? I need you to call me now . Nah , first one 's on the house . Thanks , I appreciate that . Paul ? Hello , Sarah . There is a painless way to reunite with Siobhan and Kira . Simply surrender yourself . Rachel , you bitch ! Me and Kira are not your bloody subjects . - Neither is Siobhan . - The terms of my offer still stand . We 'll pretend you didn 't run . Rachel , if you touch one hair on my daughter 's head , I will ... Evening . Evening , fellas , what can I get you ? - Are your eggs the domesticated type ? - How do you mean ? I think my friend is asking for free-range eggs . Undomesticated . No free-range , no free-run , just normal eggs . Then they 're not normal . Your chickens have been interfered with . They 're not my chickens , they 'rejust my eggs . I bet you ordered up a whole mess of eggs . - Who are you ? - She 's got the lilt . Yeah . This is the one . Uh-uh-uh ... Come on . After you . I think we 'll let the lady leave on her own . He 's unarmed , now . You sure , Sarah ? We 've come here to take you to Kira . Where is she ? Sarah ! Sarah ! Nowhere to run ! - Sarah . - Oh , shit . We 're your best option . Come on . Get off ! So tonight , you should all be extra sweet to me . - Fe ! - It 's Chicken . Hi ! - Where have you been ? - Bloody hell , what ? - What are you doing ? - What ? Is this why you haven 't answered your phone ? Yeah , because I 'm in the midst of a five-way . We have an emergency and you 're high ? - Yeah ! What ? - You 're kidding me ! What are you wearing ? - What , Sarah , what ? - They took Kira ! Mrs S 's truck was still there . Her purse , the place was trashed like they 'd been dragged out . Okay , wait . Can wejust , can we back up a sec ? - Okay ? Just ... - No , we need to go , Fe . How do we know that this isn 't Helena again , Sarah ? - No , she 's gone ! - She 's gone where ? Just gone , okay ? Shit ! Okay , whoa , whoa , wait . Wait . You said all the other phones have been disconnected . Well , why isn 't yours disconnected , yeah ? Probably because they 're tracking that stupid pink burner . Yeah , you 're probably right . Hello ? Hello ? It 's Paul , Sarah . - Who else is listening ? - You know my situation ? Tell them I want to talk to Mrs S. You 're going have to come in for that . I don 't see a better choice , Sarah . I 'll meet you alone . Wait for my call . She 's smarter than you think . Do one more thing to help her , so I can put a bullet in your head . No , no , you can 't meet Paul . No . - No , not in person , no . - No . Hey , ow ! Shit , sorry . Sorry . Okay , come on , get your shit together , you silly tit . I need you to make a side trip for me , yeah ? Please just come to the Dyad event . Hey , think what you 're asking me to do . We can negotiate your position but you need to start talking to Leekie . - We need the Dyad now . - We ? You , if you are sick . Our relationship can be whatever we want . We have leverage . - You still work for Leekie . - On your behalf , to protect you . These samples aren 't going to go to Dyad and you can 't tell them that we know about the patent , either . I do my own research first . This is my biology , it 's my decision . Okay ? Okay . You 're right . What the Dickens ? Rachel took Kira ? She can 't do that , we agreed to a code of conduct . Yeah , well , Sarah didn 't sign a deal , did she ? - Shh ! - Sorry . I was supposed to ask you something but ljust ... Oh , can we borrow a gun ? Oh , right , you need a gun . Apparently , I 'm the go-to girl for guns . - No , no . Okay . - Right ? Alison , come here . We ... Holy shit ! What 's with the balls of your thumbs ? They 're so bouncy . Felix , are you high ? - I didn 't know there was going to be ... - Shh ! ... a huge emergency , did I ? Keep quiet , my children are sleeping . - I 'm sorry . - Look , I do not keep guns in my house any more . They 're at the range , in my locker . Could you maybe just go and fetch us one , please ? Sarah can 't ... just go around shooting people with my guns . They 're registered to me . I 'm trying to get my family life back in order , I 'm not drinking any more , no more little helpers . I 'm doing a musical . Oh , my God , not Cats . Alison ? Oh , my God . Hide ! Hello , Donnie . Who are you talking to ? Um ... I 'm ... I 'm running lines . For the play , obviously . At 4 : 00 am ? - I 'm not in control of the muse . - The muse ? Mmm-hmm . - You wouldn 't understand . - No , I don 't understand . Just go to bed . - Fine , don 't be long . - Okay . What are you wearing ? - Oh , yeah . - No , no , no . Look , I might be able to help with a firearm , unregistered . - Seriously ? - Yes , I have a friend . Let 's call him Ramon . You know a gun dealer named Ramon ? He 's a gun enthusiast , he has many jobs . He 's very hard-working . - Okay . - Tell Sarah to meet me at Glendale Community Theatre , 4 : 00 pm . Paul here . Here 's how this is going to work . You Paul ? Yeah . Twenty bucks . Can 't trust anyone these days . - I knew they 'd be all over you . - Yeah , you 've got about 30 seconds . Okay , well , now that nobody 's listening , where exactly are they ? All they gave me is a message from Rachel . Tomorrow morning she 's getting on a private plane with Kira . You could be on that plane with her or not . What ? She 's just a child , Paul . How can they use her as leverage ? Sarah , I can 't tell you what to do . But tonight there 's a big event at the Dyad , Rachel will be there . Okay , what else ? She 's , uh , insulated . Daniel rarely leaves her side . But now he 's tasked with bringing you back . He 's coming after you . She says , " Up yours ! " Hey , can I borrow your phone ? Can I touch your boob ? Cheeky ! It 's like a glitzy corporate event , Sarah . I don 't see what good a gun is going to do . She 's planning on gate-crashing . I don 't have a plan , yet . - Cosima , where 's Delphine ? - At the Dyad . Getting ready . She wants me to go to this thing , maybe ... Maybe I should . I smelled lesbians in my bed last night . Look , I 'm not going to apologise for my heart , okay ? But I promise both of you guys that I 'm not going to get fooled again . Why don 't I talk to them , Sarah ? No . No , no , no ! Just sit tight , okay ? I 'll feel better when I have a gun . This is totally crazy . Oh . - Morning , Mrs Hendrix . - Hello , Ramon . Did I catch you on a break ? Oh , customer service never takes a break at Econo-Mart . So , uh ... Avamax , Sarafem , something between A and Z ? No , thank you , I 'm actually taking a break . - Oh . - Hmm . Kicking it natural ? Uh , no , no , no . Not interested in natural , either . I have a ... I have a friend who needs a piece maker . Mrs Hendrix ! I have a nice selection , all clean , numbers filed . If you like a revolver this.45 , is a , uh , pretty bad-ass matte black . Is that a lady grip ? Hot , practical . Mmm . Thank you , Ramon . So , how 's your mother ? Hey , um , one subject is showing fresh symptoms . You think you could take a closer look at their profile for me ? You mean the one with some kind of synthetic sequence you refuse to explain ? Yeah , that one . No , I can 't , because you told me to erase the data . I 'm sending you a new blood sample . Dr Cormier . Dr Leekie asked me to escort you upstairs as soon as you arrived . Of course . Is there something going on I should know about ? Where 's Cosima , Delphine ? Exactly where you want her . Here in town , considering your employment offer . Be careful playing for the other team , Delphine . Cosima 's scared of us . She 's seen how you 've persecuted Sarah . Sarah is not your subject . You 're a eugenicist , Dr Cormier . Is that a dirty word for you as a scientist ? No . I want Cosima here , - full-time , starting tonight . - So do I. 324B21 is showing the same respiratory symptoms as the other two . Congratulations . I 'm invested , which I 'm sure is what you wanted . - Okay , people . - Oh ! Listen up , let 's gather . Everyone , let 's gather . Circle , please , hands . Troupe , in three days we move to the main stage for dress rehearsal . In four days , we open . Losing Aynsley is heartbreaking we are not civilians . This is the theatre and we all know that the show must go on . So , Kelsie is going to be stepping out of the wings to play Laura . Um , excuse me . I 'm your Laura . No , Ali . We all know how close you are to this but you 've rehearsed with Aynsley , you know the part , we want you to play Sheila . You want me to be the lead ? Yes . Give it up . - You can do this . - Okay . - Show them . Hmm ? Shine . - Mmm-hmm . Okay , people , let 's all shine on stage . Let 's pick it up from the point where everyone helps Sheila clean up after the unfortunate death . All right ? Mop . Mop . Lovely . Stop crying . Carter , deep breath . One , two , three , four ! ♪ We will sing , sing , sing away the hours ♪ Shout till our throats are sore ♪ And we will raise our voices to the heavens ' garden ♪ Some will hear a mighty roar ♪ And we will wipe , wipe , wipe away the plasma ♪ Scrub off every stain ♪ Since I cannot control my asthma ♪ I 'll stand by to entertain ♪ Yes , brava ! Bravissima ! Alison Hendrix is in a musical . What ? What musical ? I think Cats . I think she 's playing the lead . Beth 's dead , German 's dead , Sarah Manning gets sprung on the cusp of confessing and we 're left with Alison Hendrix , model citizen and thespian . - Yeah . - Yeah . You 're kidding me . - That 's her . - Shit ! We 're not supposed to be on this thing , Angie . Dammit ! - Hey , long time no see . - Shit ! Sarah , don 't run . Come on . What do you want with Alison Hendrix ? I just told you , they killed a man right in front of me , Art . Hey , I 'm talking to you . Tell me what you are to each other . - To Beth . - We don 't know , that 's the whole point . - Yeah ? - Yeah . The diner , sounds like the two bodies that Grigson and Diaz - caught this morning . - I know . - She probably does , too . - Yeah . Those are the people behind it , the same ones that got me out ofjail . - She 's making this stuff up . - Then arrest me . You can 't , can you ? - Huh ? - Just come on . Come on . Let 's go check her story out . It 's a fortunate position you find yourself in , Paul . How is that , Miss Duncan ? You 're the only one who seems to know what makes Sarah tick . I need your office this evening . It 's the Koreas , both of them . Ah . Well , good . Congratulations . Paul , have you ever been to Taiwan ? Taiwan , no . I don 't suppose you speak Mandarin ? - No . - Hmm . Pity . Pack a bag , we leave Tuesday . Good luck , Paul . Keeping him up-close and personal ? Of course . Rachel , did you seriously kidnap Sarah 's people ? The less you know about it the better . The child may be a biological goldmine but so 's her mother . Daniel will recover Sarah . - Is that really necessary ? - Yes . And not your concern . We have a big evening , you need to be on point . To combine is to create to engineer , divine . You 'll do wonderfully , Aldous . Come on , let 's go check it out . She probably dropped those bodies herself . They have my daughter , Art . Hey , so what 's up ? Best shooting we caught in two years and the Federales walked in . Check it out . - How you doing , Ang ? - So what happened ? George Hudson , line cook . .45 to the sixth chakra . Cowboy was still waiting but shotgun to the mid-section . What chakra is that ? Uh , somewhere between the third and the fourth . There 's a possible eyewitness , tea drinker . Tea drinker . Yeah , takes out her wallet , escapes out the back . Okay . Thanks , man . Sarah , if your daughter 's missing , we 'll put out an AMBER alert . These people are powerful , they got me out ofjail . You can 't do anything . Just let me go , please . Just before the lawyer showed up , you were about to tell me everything , what this really is . You don 't want to know everything , Art . You don 't want that chick to know anything . The Feds took over the scene from Grigson and Diaz . - Which Feds ? - I didn 't get an acronym . Seriously ? We 're off a case that doesn 't exist , Angie . You want to walk her in there and hand her over , you go right ahead . Come on , you . - Thank you . - " Thank you ' " ? You miss us ? You miss Beth 's life , you little grifter ? Piss off . She almost trusts me , Angie . No , I " m not letting you turn yourself over to Neolutionists . What am I meant to do , Fe ? Eh ? If Rachel 's got Kira on a plane , I have to be with her . Look , look , Sarah , Delphine put me on the list for the Dyad tonight , okay ? I can go in there and , like , demand that Rachel let them go . Rachel doesn 't take demands , Cosima . That 's why I needed the bloody gun . - Anybody in the house ? - Ah . - It 's Ramon ! - Ramon ? Delivery from Mrs Hendrix . Well , those are so Alison . It 's what 's inside that counts . No ? Am I wrong , sailor ? Whoa ! Seriously , Sarah , what good is that going to do ? Alison , you know some very strange people . Oh , they look nice . Sorry I couldn 't bring them in person , I have scads of costumes to alter . - And thanks for the card , too . - Are you making fun of me ? - I made that ! - No , no , no , no . It 's good to see you , Alison . We love you , Alison . Well , normally I 'd say don 't do anything rash but rash seems to be a genetic trait , so ... Go get Kira . Believe me , right now is the time to resist our predisposition to impulsive behaviour . We need a plan . You don 't have a plan ? No , the plan 's a bit of an issue . Hey , I know where Rachel is , that 's enough . Sarah , what are you going to do ? Walk into the Dyad with a gun and just start shooting people ? - I mean ... - Yeah . Uh , duh-duh-duh ... I don 't want to know anything , leave me out of it . - Plausible deniability . - Yeah , sure . I have to be Sarah Stubbs at 9 : 00 pm to do fitting and run lines , so ... - break a leg , Sarah . - Thanks again . This thing at the Dyad , it 's like a big do , yeah ? Yeah . Big pharma , big agra , VIPs , security . That 's good , that 's good . That 'll be helpful , they 'll be busy . Okay , what do you want to do ? Plausible deniability . Oh , no . It 's easiest just to give Rachel what she wants , yeah ? Me . Just not how she 's expecting it . Okay , even if I agree with what I think you 're thinking , how do you get next to Rachel with Daniel in the way ? Alison 's not going to like it . Paul Dierden . Paul , it 's Sarah , let me speak to her . She wants Rachel . Hi , Sarah , this is Daniel . I speak for Rachel . I 'm ready to make a deal , face-to-face . Well , Rachel 's a very busy woman but if you tell me where you are , I 'll bring you to her . Right , I 'll meet you at 9 : 00 pm . I 'll be driving the red minivan . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Let go ! Who in the hell are you ? This is unacceptable , I need to talk to Dr Leekie right away . That won 't be necessary , ma 'am , this is our mistake . It won 't happen again . Denise ! Shite . Cosima ! - Hey . - You came . You won 't regret this , I promise . Aldous , look who it is . - Ah , no , no . - No , no , come , come , come . I wasn 't as sure as Delphine that you 'd come . Here I am . Um , it doesn 't mean I 'm going to sign your contract , though . A starting point . We 're in uncharted waters , really , it 's all up to you . Okay , then I want my own lab . Dr Leekie will be welcoming you to the Dyad Institute . - Please stand by . - That 's my cue . Cosima , you have a bright future ahead of you . This is the best place you could be right now . Thank you , Dr Leekie . - Enjoy yourself . - Hmm . You 're Sarah . Yeah , nice to meet you , too . Does Cosima know you 're doing this ? Depends if I get caught . - Now , where are Kira and Siobhan ? - What ? Don 't play stupid . Rachel kidnapped my family , where are they ? I mean , how would I know ? I 've never even seen Rachel . I 've seen her and if you want to keep Cosima out of this , you 're going to tell me where she is . Okay . There is serious business going on right now behind the scenes and so , my guess is that she 's using Leekie " s wing . - Where 's that ? - Down there . It 's impossible to get down there . You need a specific swipe card for the tenth floor . Like this ? You 're going to get yourself killed . Miss Cormier ? Please welcome Dr Leekie . Thank you , everyone . I am Dr Aldous Leekie , Director of the Dyad Institute , and it is my great pleasure to welcome you here on behalf of the entire Dyad group of companies . The keystone of the original Dyad Institute was set here in 1918 . Today , worldwide , the overwhelming majority of biotech research is funded by private capital and today the Dyad Group spans the globe . We employ 27,000 souls in 134 countries , including Vatican City . The age of biotechnology is upon us . It is the moral responsibility of visionaries like us to continue healing , feeding and fuelling the future of humanity . The recent Supreme Court decision characterising the legal status of natural versus synthetic DNA was the successful result of our lobbying strategies . We are proceeding with the next tranche of patent claims . Good , you made it . I want my daughter . Of course , and we want you to be together but my people found your foster mother 's house overturned . They were gone when we got there . - You 're lying . - I lied to get you here . But we don 't have them . Kira 's here and I want to see her now . You 're not going to shoot me , Sarah . If you don 't have her , you 're dead . There are other forces vying for our fate , Sarah . We 'll get Kira back , together . Nobody lays hands on me . You don 't own us . Sarah ... Put it down . - Where is Kira ? - They don 't have her . They were playing me , too . Now , lower the gun . - What are you , her bodyguard now ? - It 's you they want . It is over , Sarah . Turn around . In the face ? Sorry . Go . I 'll figure out something to tell them . Hey , it 's me . Jesus Christ , you are like a bad smell . Look , I didn 't know where else to go . Maggie Chen ? What , you 're not having one ? I want it straight up . It wasn 't them , Art . The Dyad people , somebody else took Kira . I know . What ? The Feds are calling the diner thing domestic terrorism . The cowboy that took the shotgun blast was a religious extremist , like Maggie Chen . A Prolethean . Helena 's people . Why don 't we start with that ? Who is Helena ? Are you sure you want to know what this is all about ? I guess we 'll find out . Excuse me . My sister shot me . I need some help here . Trauma team ! Okay , no , we need a nurse here right now . Look at the camera . Shot point-blank in the chest and she walks in ? - How is she even alive ? - We remember Aynsley 's warmth . I killed Aynsley . I watched it happen , Felix , I didn 't do anything about it . The old wing is where our most sensitive research takes place . So , this is where you keep the clones ? Rachel takes insult very personally . - Would you leave us , please ? - Yes , of course . Kira ? Hello ? They 're gone . Young girl matching Kira 's description and some guy . I said get your hands on the car . - You 're going to regret this . Ripped By mstoll

 Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha . - Every five seconds , someone lives . And every eight seconds , someone dies . And every second in between , we 're here or here time ... they say that time is lost in memory . We cannot touch , see or control time . We are essentially prisoners in this fourth dimension . And one day , all of this will be gone . Yet , for some reason , we don 't seem to care too much and would rather fight each other . The truth is ... we are not really here for that long . And for the majority of us , we only get one chance at all of this . 41 - Why ? The question that has plagued the human mind since the birth of the world . What is all this about ? Who am I and how did we all get here ? I find it interesting that everything seems so strange to us . If we look at a word too long , if we really think too much , It already doesn 't make sense . How strange is everything ? We float on a giant water-covered ball in the middle of nothing . Why is it so strange ? Why does it seem so weird ? What are we comparing this to ? I want honest answers here , people . Right now . The question is of course the ultimate one : " Why are we here ? " I know what I think . I wanna hear what you all think . Jennifer ? - The bible has all the answers for me , Mr. Wertz . - Thank you . Finally some truth in this room . I wanna hear something new for once . Something totally different . Raise your hands , people . Dennis ? - Mathematically speaking , we 're most likely a microscopic molecule in an atom that-- - that makes up something a lot larger than we can comprehend . If we add time to the equation . We could- - we could be making up the dirt on the bottom of the universal sizes elephant that--that has taken one step in our galaxy 's lifetime . - That 's very interesting , Dennis . And is this your truth ? - It just seems to make sense to me . You know ? We used to think that inside an atom was a couple of nuclei . Now we 've discovered an entire cosmos . The--the solar system itself resembles the interior rotation of an atom anyway . Science has to play a part in all of this . - Take your pants off and prove it ! - Please , please ... ladies and gentlemen , please . Anyone else ? What do you think ? Aidan , what do you think ? - I ... I believe in the unknown . I don 't know . I don 't think we 'll ever know the answer to that question . - So you believe in nothing ? - Oh , belief and reality are two different things . - Well , what about when you die ? - When I die ? - All of us . Well , let me ask you , Jennifer . What happens when you die ? - Heaven ... or hell . - Dennis ? - That universal sized elephant just keeps on walking . - OK ... OK . Now , please , Aidan . - We 've all been dead a lot longer than we 've been alive . - OK now down to business . Ladies and gentlemen , please take out your papers . Officially , exclusively and mathematically this is your final Philosophy exam for the term this semester and the year . Unfortunately , the remainder of your possible careers finals to this point . So , if you feel you 're not ready , bad luck . You have four and a half hours , starting now . Good luck . See you in the future . - Hello . - What ? - You 're gonna listen to me very carefully . Don 't go to the Ritz East Gate motel . - What is that supposed to mean ? - Don 't go to the East Gate motel . Stay away . - Wait ! Wait--wait a minute ! - So ... Sarah ... - Haven 't heard of her . It 's open ! - Uh ... She 's pretty cute . - Really ? - She 's got it going on . - How ? - I don 't know . - Hey , how was your exam ? - Alright , she 's cute . You just ... are you gonna talk to to me about her ? - Oh , what 's cute about her ? - Uh ... She 's chubby , she 's funny ... - Are you OK ? - I 'm having ... running round and round just doing finals stuff and ... - Did you just say that she 's chubby and that 's what you love about her ? - Yeah . - That 's odd ? That 's ... - She lost so much weight , so . - She was sweet , wasn 't she ? - I 'm taking my bike after the exam and someone came up to me and it was ... me , like ... - You ? - My clothes , my face , my voice , everything . - Were you standing in front of a girl ? - Was it like a cousin or relative or something that you didn 't ... - At first I thought it was a joke , but then ... when I actually looked it freaked me out . - Are you on drugs ? - Are you sure you want me to ... - He said " Don 't go to the Ritz East Gate Motel . " - How ? Are you gonna do it for me ? - I hate to ... - I just don 't see why ... - What ? - Why would he say that ? - Don 't go in the Ritz East Gate Motel ? - Yeah . - What 's going on down there ? - Hello Gran . - I 've seen you before . - Yeah . Something like that . Hello ? Yeah , who else ? Yes . Middle name ? Uh , it 's Sal . Listen man , I gotta go . - How was your exam ? - Yeah , it was fine , just fine . Fingers crossed . - What 's the matter ? - Something ... happened this morning . - Are you in trouble ? - No , nothing like that , just ... something weird happened . I saw something I can 't explain and ... . does our family have a history of mental illness , depression , paranoia , hallucinations ? - A golf ball drowned your grandfather , you know ? - Yes , I know , Gran . - Wish I could see him again . Your great-grandmother had diabetes , there is a history of cancer , and both was too , in the men . What does Lauren think ? - Oh , nothing . - When are you two gonna get married ? - I don 't know , grandma . Soon , maybe . - But first I want great-grandchildren and I want to be at the wedding , but not in that order . - OK . - So , nothing brain related ? I just wanna make sure it 's not all just ... in my head . - Isn 't everything just in your head ? Will you read to me ? - Yeah , sure . What shall we read ? The four swans where did we stop ? - I 'm at the beginning . - It 's a good place . - Can I help you ? Aidan . - Hey , Lauren . - What are you doing here ? - I 'm sorry . I didn 't know you worked here . How 's things ? - Things are good . - How 's your shift going ? - It 's fine . Good . Are you here for something ? - This is gonna sound strange . Have I been here before ? - I don 't know . Shouldn 't you know that ? - I know it sounds weird , but have you seen me here before ? Like someone who looks a lot like me ? - Uh , I don 't think so . I ... - E ... everything alright here ? - Yeah , it 's fine . - He said " Don 't go to the Ritz East Gate Motel . " Well , here I am . - Yeah ... That 's an interesting story . And I don 't know whether I should believe a word of it . - That makes two of us . - Don 't you mean two of you ? - So what are you doing now ? - Nothing . Nothing much . Just working . - Just working ? So you work , you go home and you do absolutely nothing ? - No . I do things . - And ? - And I 'm doing a painting course . - Painting ? Really ? Finally . - Yeah . - And how 's your grandma ? - She 's OK . Uh ... we had to put her in a home , pretty much . Just after we broke up . - Oh ... OK ... - it 's been good to see you again , Lauren . - Good to see you , too , Aidan . - You still live around here ? - No , I 've moved , actually . - Do you want a lift ? - Aidan ? - Yeah ? - I think I should tell you something . - Yeah ? - Something I should have told you a while ago . Well , I 'm just gonna say it . Look out ! - OK ... There 's no signs of concussion or anything . And he 's gonna be sore for a couple of days , but either than that , he 's gonna be absolutely fine . - OK . - Thanks . - Thanks . - Hey man . - Hi ... hi . - Hey . - Hi . - How are you feeling ? - Fine . - Are you okay ? - You look pretty ... - What happened ? - You were in a car accident . - Yeah , it was pretty bad . And ... and the ... the ... the doctor called your grandmother and they called me and ... And then I called Nick and ... and we 've been here for a while now . - Where 's Lauren ? - Oh , and ... and he said that you may have hit your head . They think that maybe you 've hit your head , so ... um to ask you if ... if ... if your head hurts . Where 's Lauren ? We could get you some water , we could ... Get him some water . - Sit back . - Sit back ... look , look , relax . It 's okay . The doctor will be here any minute . - Don 't sit up . Just relax , it 's fine . - The doctor will be here ... - I 'm fine . - Sit back . - Where 's Lauren ? - You cannot leave the hospital . You are allowed to use the phone to call family and friends . A lawyer has been assigned and will be meeting with you tomorrow . - So I 'm being charged for something ? - Well , the family has stated that they 'd like to press charges . Given the circumstances of your past relationship with the deceased , they 're having a hard time understanding what she was doing in the car with you . - Man , I was just going to drive her home . - You don 't have to explain to us . - Yet . - Well , I don 't see your lawyers present . - Just some of the things that have to be done these days , unfortunately . Now , we have to be very clear on this . You cannot leave the hospital . Even though you 're not in custody , if you do leave here , it can make things a lot worse . Do you understand ? - Yeah . - Good . - Peanut butter and Russian currency , the Atlantic Ocean and a melted Rollerblade . It 's a great game . Really simple . You think of two things , any things , the only rule is they have to be as non-related as possible , just like you and me . A lava lamp and a dead horse kidney . The Atlantic Ocean and a melted Rollerblade . Helps take your mind off things . Give it a go . - No , thanks . - Well , maybe one day I 'll find someone to actually play with . You 're in some trouble , I see . ( sing-songy ) I know something you don 't know . Something weird happened to you . Didn 't it ? Something really strange . Something you don 't seem able to explain and most likely ... - What ? - Git you into this mess . - How do you know about that ? - I could tell you , but you 're gonna figure it out for yourself no matter what I say . But I can give you a hint . Go to the East Gate motel . - I knew it ! I knew something was going on . - Room 41 . There 's a hole in the bathroom . In the ground . You have to go into the floor ! - The floor ? - Exactly . - Hi , Aidan . This is going to help you relax and sleep and make sure you stay here tonight . - Room 41 , you said ? - And you 're late ! - John turns up , and then , his best friend . And she brings up her brother , You know who her brother is ? Sam ! Jess ! - Yeah , looks funeral gonna be one night next week I 'm not sure when , but . Um ... I 'll let you know when we 've got some more detail . Uh , can you hang on for a moment ? I 've got someone out here . Uh , excuse me , can I help you ? Come in . Come in . I 'll ... I 'll ... I 'll have to ... uh ... call you back . I 've got to help somebody , OK ? Yes , sir , how can I help you ? - I just wanna get a room . - Uh , fine , yes . We 've got ... uh ... got room . We 've got room 11 ... eh ... just for yourself ? One night ? - That 's fine . - How are you gonna pay for that ? Card ? OK . Thank you . OK ... Here you go . OK , thanks very much . Good . - It was late this afternoon when a car swerved off . Berkey Road and hit this power pole behind me . The passenger died on site while the driver was taken to the hospital with minimal injuries . It is not yet known what caused the car to lose control , but police are pushing forward for full investigation . - Hey ! Get out of me - Hey , man . It 's me . - Get out ! I 'll stab you out ! - Aidan ! I read your paper . You really outdid yourself this time . - You could have told me , Mr.Wertz. - You know , it 's minds like yours that ... well ... you really think outside the box . Me and a couple of colleagues of mine , we meet every Wednesday to talk about ... science related issues and ... - She 's fine . You talk to her for longer than sixty seconds and she still informs you that a golf ball thrown to my grandfather - Grandfather . Yeah , I do remember that . - I never actually told her that we broke up . - What ? After all this time ? - Yeah , after all this time . - That 's a bit strange , isn 't it ? - It would have killed her . She 's still got that photo that you gave her for her eightieth birthday of us . She loves you . Still loves you . - I miss your grandma . - She called me out the other week and she told me she wanted to go bowling . I said " Are you serious ? " We went bowling and Amy was in the stand bow . She was in her slippers and gown . Bowled a few balls within the slab magazine thing . She had fun . - Yeah , that 's cute . - Mmm . - I love bowling . You remember that time that-- - - ( together ) We went bowling . - Watch out ! - Can I get an ambulance please ? To room 41 . East Gate motel . - I don 't know , like ... he was really weird . He was talking about this room 41 of a motel room that has a black hole that ... that leads to yesterday and something about like ... he was in a car accident with Lauren and she died . And that he was the reason that she died ? And he 's gonna be back in time or something ? - Hey kid . - Hi . - How was your nap ? - You don 't belive , right ? - Come on , man , you 're actually joking , right ? - Come with me . - Why ? Did you lose it ? - What for ? - No , I 'm trying to prove a point . Call him . - Hello ? Who ? Aidan . This is you , Aidan . - It 's the other Aidan . He hasn 't been through this yet , right ? - If this is Aidan , what 's my brother 's middle name ? - Uh , it 's Sal . Listen man , I gotta go . - Hello ? Who tal- - He hung up . - What ? Are you sure ? - You hung up . Come on , this is actually a joke , right ? - Listen , you guys were both there , after the accident , in the hospital . It 's all gonna happen . - Look , it 's just weird , alright ? This is just getting really weird , Aidan . Look , I ... I know that you had problems getting over Lauren and I understand that , really , we do , we care about you a lot , but Nick and I , we checked her Facebook page before and she was online . She 's not dead . - Not yet ! - Not yet ? ! Can you go forward in time ? Like in the future ? - I don 't know . - What if Nick said that to you ? You know , " Ah , hey , I 've found a motel room 41 with a black hole . - Crazy . - But at least check it out . - Crazy . - It 's crazy . - No . Because you remember this time last year I told both of you to come with me to the petrol station . And I 've been drinking but I saw Elvis . - Oh , hell no . - He 's alive . I saw him and you wouldn 't believe me . - Shut up . - And you wouldn 't believe me . - Shut up . - Guys , you 're not listening to me ! Just come to the motel with me and I can prove it all to you ! - I 'm sorry , OK ? We 're not gonna come , OK ? - Oh , oh ... here , look what we 've done . - When all this happens ... - Look what we 've done . Where are you going ? - When all this happens , just act surprised . - Where you going , Sully ? - Aidan ... - I 'm leaving . - Look ... - He 's probably going for a sniff . - He 's not going for a sniff . - Aidan ... Hello , what brings you here ? - Hey , Mr. Wertz . Sorry to bother you . I got your listing from the ... university . You said you had a meeting here ? - Yes ! Y-yes , of course . Please , come in . - Thanks ... - It 's screwed , but I disagree . The fundamental world of mathematics exists only to comprehend the impossible . One plus one does not always equal two . - Everyone , this is Aidan . Professor Jacobs has a fascination with the alternative perspective of knowledge . - To think , to know is to ... - ... know what to think . Aidan , this is my very old friend , Mr. Wertz . - Aidan takes my philosophy class in ? . Top grades . - So , what brings you here , Aidan ? - I 've got a few questions . - " Why " questions ? - Not why , how . It 's about time travel . - Ah , excellent . - Interest or research ? - Both . - Would you go forward or back ? - You can 't go back . It 's already happened . Forward is the most probable outcome. it 's being proven that it 's possible . - I 'm writing a book . A novel , actually . So some of the questions I ask may seem a little out there . - We need more time-travel books in this world . - We don 't need more books , Mr. Wertz . We do need more scientists that make the ideas in those books a reality . - Professor Jacobs ... - I 'm sorry , Aidan . Go on . - Uh ... It 's about a guy who finds a hole in a room that leads to yesterday . He goes through it and then comes back out twelve hours earlier . - Intriguing . - Impossible . - Let him finish . - if you were to travel backwards , in time , say , to yesterday , would you be ... able to change your future ? - That all depends on the rules of the time travel setting . Can the traveler see alternate versions of himself ? - Yes . Definitely . - So that 's complicated . because time doesn 't exist in nature , of course . It 's a measurement of movement in space . - I tend to disagree with that . Nature is based in time . But we can go on and on all night arguing about what does and doesn 't exist . - I guess . So , what are the rules ? How does it all work ? - Well , in fiction there are four elements of time . - What about non-fiction ? - I guess it would be the same . If you could travel through time , there would have to be a hole in space-time , a rip , if you like . If you could survive the journey through the hole , well , you 'd arrive at the same space at a different time , or a different space , different time . Correct me if I 'm wrong . - Yeah , like a wormhole or a Stargate . Go on . You 're doing fine . - So , if you could travel back through ... uh ... I 'll tell you what ; a visual might be useful here . - What are you doing ? - So , this is your life from birth to death . And this is you today . So , if we would go back in time to ... - Yesterday . - ... yesterday , OK , now , if time is circular , you would bring space back to yourself and travel through . You could in theory visit past versions of yourself . In a two parallel universe theory one that is all in slices , an infinite amount really , it wouldn 't actually be time but another dimension in reality . Because time ... - Doesn 't exist in nature . Well , I need to add that . - So , what does this man do when he goes through the hole ? - Uh ... well , he 's trying to save somebody . A girl . - Classic . - Predictable . - So , he 's already in a parallel universe , because past versions of himself have already visited him before he traveled . You seem confused by your own writing . It 's very confusing . There 's no pattern to it . He tried to stop the accident as many times as he could , but nothing ever worked . - if he can 't change his own future surely he can change the future of a different version of himself . Exactly. he cannot change his own line of existence and yet influence another line . - Then that sucks . - So he needs to change a different version of himself to get the desired result . - This story needs more emotion . How does he know this girl ? - Uh , it 's his ex-girlfriend . - Weak , overused plot element . He needs to save a part of himself . - But wouldn 't the girl be a part of himself ? A part of his history ? - Only if he set up a relationship in the beginning . Set up to destroy . It ... lacks surprise , but it works . What you 'd really need is a twist . - There are a lot of twists . - But .. That 's what keeps it into these days . Special effects and twists . - None. he just goes through the hole . Turns up at the same hole . - Sounds like the last 25 years of my marriage . - Well , thanks for letting me speak to your friends tonight , Mr.Wertz. - You 're more than welcome , mate . Are you sure you 're OK ? - Yeah . I 'm all good . - So where would you go ? If you could ? - I don 't know . How about you ? Forward first and then back to fix it . When I was twelve years old , I had this idea . Most of my friends had dreams of flying . Mine were of traveling through time , as a matter of fact . I 'd sit down at my grandfather 's typewriter and write to the universe . The idea was to become famous . I 'd put the call out that I wanted to travel through time . Go on T.V. newspapers , concerts , t-shirts , books , really put the word out there that I wanted to travel through time . But I realized that time travel in my lifetime would be impossible . So I hoped that someone in the future would remember the time travel kid . When time travel was actually possible , you know ? They 'd go back and come and get me . - Maybe one day . - So , your character ... . can it go forward ? - Only back . - Make sure he goes back for the right reasons . Make sure he influences the most important situations . - I will . - Aidan , 27. graduated two years ago , extremely high marks in philosophy and psychology . You were a state champion scout member . Mom left you as a baby , then Gran took the rights . You broke up with Lauren a few years ago , decided to take her on a joy ride . You crashed the car , killed her , then ran away and then you find yourself here . - Dum , dum , dum ... Can I ask you why you left the hospital ? - I don 't know . - Do you remember us telling you that you shouldn 't ? - Yeah . - You 're deep in a lot of trouble , Aidan . We know what you did and why you did it . Were you supposed to die in that crash ? Is that why you 're upset ? Your plan didn 't work out properly ? - I had nothing to do with it . The accident . - Ah ... . the boy 's triggered a memory . Things don 't add up , Aidan . You seemed genuinely concerned the last time we spoke to you , then you decided to just run off . Not to get away , but to go back to ... where you ... . picked her up from . So , the question is ... what happens next ? - What happens , Aidan ? - You confess to us , right now . You 're heading to court , the judge will be lenient , say nothing , confess silence , your penalty will be something to regret . - So what 's it gonna be ? - You wanna know the truth ? - Please . - I found a time portal . A hole that leads back to yesterday . - Wow ... - This is classified as insanity . - I tried to go back and stop the accident . I couldn 't save her . - They never can . - So you killed her and then went back in time to stop yourself from killing her ? - I 'm telling you the truth . - So , you can really travel back in time ? So , why waste that privilege on trying to save Lauren ? You still love her . - I went back to stop the accident from happening . To save her . I couldn 't . So I have to go back and try again . - Why not go back in time and break yourself out of custody ? - I 'm not the only one of me out there . Thanks for the idea . - Woohoo ! Hoohoohoo . - Come on ! Come dance with me ! Come dance . Come dance with me ! - You 'll be waiting . You 're not even funny . - Ha-ha ! You got Meth ? Got heroin ? Got any of the good kind ? Huh ? You got to answer . You got to answer to me . Never . We 're in this together . Dancin ' , dancin ' , you gonna dance with me ? Try this step . This works well . This works well . Try this step . Try it . Try these . Try dancing with me . - Hey , hey , hey ... you have to swap with me . - Yeah , yeah , yeah ! Alright ! Oh , good step ! Oh ! Oh ! - OK ... go . - Oh , wow ! Look ! - Shh ! - Gotta keep dancing , man . We 're ahead of you , beginner . it can 't hurt . We 'd go home . Really good , man . Don 't leave me . Don 't go . Don 't go ! Don 't leave me ! Don 't go ! Don 't leave me ! Come back ! Come back ! Me and you ! Oh ! - [ indistinct radio chatter ] - [ indistinct radio chatter ] - [ indistinct radio chatter ] - Hey ! - [ indistinct radio chatter ] - [ indistinct radio chatter ] - Hey ! It 's me , Aidan . - Sorry ? Can ... can I help you ? - You don 't remember , do you ? - I 'm sorry ? - Can I ask you a question ? - I think you just did . - What do you do for a living ? - I 'm a lawyer . - Was there ever a chance any lot of this could have gone another way ? - I don 't know what you mean . - Like your lot could have changed ? Like you weren 't gonna be a lawyer ? - Well , yes , as a matter of fact I almost went off to war . - And then what happened ? - I ... I registered and I was preparing to leave and then the strangest thing happened . I 'm sorry . I don 't know you . - That 's alright . You 've said enough . You 've changed , moved on , it 's ... it 's possible . - OK . - Tomato sauce and the musical Archie . - A blue guitar and a frozen gorilla lamp . - Hello ? - I 've seen you before . - Grandma . - I wish ... I could see your grandfather again . - Can I take you somewhere ? No ... - I 'm so sorry . - No , nothing . - Will you read to me ? - Yeah , sure . - In my bag at the top . - Where shall we begin ? - The end . - Oh , well , you again ! Is this the first time ? Or the second time ? Yesterday or ... or tomorrow ? Who knows ? Who cares ? - You might wanna put that knife down . - Oh know . You can 't stop me from cutting myself . Don 't you get it yet ? If I don 't cut myself , I don 't get take to hospital , I don 't meet you for the first time , and tell you to come here ! - I can 't change it ? - You can only influence it to change it , not intervene . You can 't physically stop me from cutting myself ! - So how do you ... know that you 're gonna tell me to come here if I 'm already standing in front of you and you haven 't been to the hospital yet ? - Exactly ! So how do I influence time ? - Open the door please , it 's the management . - I saw you . A better version---a different version of you . You saw her , did you ? Thought I 'd try it out . - -Worse . It will change your life . - Not exactly , but close enough , right ? What the hell ? - You think that 's how we go there ? - You 're a smart one ! - How did you do it ? How did you influence the alternate version of you to do ... - The trick is to stop the person from being in the situation in the first place . if you can figure that out . Open please . Open up . Remember ... time travels with you . - Hello . - Hello . - I 'm looking for Bloodfield . - Oh , you 're a field away from there . - Oh , really ? - Say ... you look familiar . Do we know each other ? - Not yet . Aidan . - Dwight . This is Aidan , dear . - Oh . - Aidan , this is my wife . - Hello . Nice to meet you , Aidan . Stop it ... - I 'm going to give Aidan a lift in the town . Would you like anything ? - Yeah , actually , if you could return the library books for me that would be great . Say , you look awfully familiar to me . - I get that a lot . - I said the same thing . - Must just be all in my head . - Isn 't everything all just in your head ? - Well , we should be off . - OK . Bye . Lovely to met you , Aidan . - You too . - Goodbye . - A golf ball drowned your grandfather . You know ? Wish I could see him again . - I 've got something . - What is it ? - You have to open it tomorrow . - Tomorrow ? - Don 't open it until then . It 's very important . See you soon . - So , your character , can it go forward ? - Only back . - Make sure he goes back for the right reasons . Make sure he influences the most important situations . - I will . - You have to go to the East Gate motel . - Can I walk you home ? - The truth is we 're not really here for that long . And for the majority of us , we only get one chance . At all of this .

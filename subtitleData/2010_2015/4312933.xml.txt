 Okay . Color and sound check , Milton-Staller wedding . - MR. STALLER : Amanda . Neal . - Hi , Mr. Staller . Glad you could make it . Hey , hey , hey . Take it easy , Nana . There 's no hurry . You take it easy . This my regular speed . Everyone decent in here ? SHELLEY : Come on in , Mrs. Staller . MRS. STALLER : Look who I brought , Shelley . This is how David can see you in your dress before the wedding without the bad luck . [ SHELLEY CHUCKLING ] You look stunning . Thank you so much for everything . I 'm so happy you 're joining the family . David is lucky to have you . Okay . I 'm crying now . Let 's not film this part . No , no , no . Turn it off . Turn it off . DAVID : Oh ... It 'll calm him down . I didn 't think I 'd be this nervous . Happens to everyone . Even me , and look how I turned out . [ CHATTERING ] Lynn . Who is that man ? I don 't know . Must be from Shelley 's side . [ GASPING ] JOSH : Just breathe , man . Breathe . No . Where 's your inhaler ? Where is it ? Here . Maybe just give us a few minutes ? Sorry . Just a couple minutes . He 's okay . He 's good . It 's okay , it 's okay . I can safely say David is not going to run . So just everybody hang tight . [ WHISPERS ] He 'll be fine . He just had a little asthma attack . It can 't be . It can 't be . - It can 't be true . - What 's wrong , Nana ? It can 't be . It 's him . LYNN : Oh , Nana , what are you talking about ? - It 's him . JOSH : Nana , calm down . You ! You ... [ NANA GAGGING GRUNTING ] MRS. STALLER : Nana , what 's wrong ? My God , what is it ? Oh , my God . Someone call 911 . [ PEOPLE COUGHING GAGGING ] Josh . Sweetheart . My God , what is happening ? [ PEOPLE COUGHING GAGGING ] MANNING : Agent Dunham . - Detective . - Burt Manning . We spoke on the phone . - So has anyone touched anything ? - ME 's inside . We put them in a holding pattern until you got here . It 's pretty bad . Do we have a final count on the victims ? Fourteen so far . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] I quite like weddings . Did I ever tell you about when your mother and I ... - God rest her soul ... . Got married ? - No , I think I missed that one . And try to stop driving with both feet . Whoa ! Whoa ! She was so beautiful , Peter . So beautiful in white . I won 't deny I was never happier . I kept my tuxedo in the hope that one day I would have a son who 'd wear it . You could wear it on your wedding day . Yeah . You know , Walter , tuxedo styles change . Oh , nonsense . Purple never goes out of style . And the day may come sooner than you think . Do you think she 'll call me Dad ? - Who ? - Agent Dunham . [ PETER LAUGHS ] My guess would be no . Don 't look at me like that . She 's just what you need . Someone who can see right through you . Agent Dunham , don 't you look lovely today . Doesn 't she look lovely , Peter ? You look lovely , Agent Dunham . Dr. Walter Bishop . How do you do ? Lose a bet ? It was either that or flying lessons . - Swelling of the vitreous humor . PETER : Mm-hm . Petechial hemorrhaging . Yeah , not to mention the blue skin . It 's definitely asphyxiation . Airway 's clear . PETER : Yeah . Same here . No fluid in the lungs . OLIVIA : So all the victims they 've identified so far are on the groom 's side . Maybe they came in contact with something before the wedding . Anaphylactic shock . Maybe they had an allergic reaction to something they ate or drank . That would be logical if they were all exposed at the same time . I 'll have the detectives reconstruct where they all were . We may find a connection . She was a Holocaust survivor . Dreadful . To survive a thing like that finish up like this . Walter , do you think this could be a deliberate attack ? I don 't know yet . All I know for certain is that these 14 people suffocated in a room full of air . PETER : It 's gotta be something they all ate or drank . There . Maybe that ? God , it 's hard to believe that a few hours ago , this was actually a happy place . [ CLANGING ] OLIVIA : Oh , my God . We need a medic on the second floor ! PETER : Hey , buddy . OLIVIA : He 's dropped his inhaler . Grab it . [ GASPS ] WALTER : It 's curious . All 15 victims . - So they were all blood relatives then ? ASTRID : Yes . All of the victims are direct descendants of Eva Staller . WALTER : Holocaust survivor . ASTRID : And anyone not related to her survived . Along with one grandchild who I think might be illegitimate . Therefore not a blood relative , or I suspect he would have perished too . Astrid , can you come here , dear ? What color is this ? The blood ? - It 's blue . - Good . I 'm not imagining it . Something has bonded with the hemoglobin in the blood changing its color and robbing the body of oxygen . I believe these people literally suffocated from the inside out . Walter , no . That might ... - be what killed him . No , that kept him alive longer than the others . I suspect it temporarily weakened the toxin . That still leaves the how . How was the toxin delivered ? Mrs. Staller , I understand that you were in charge of the guest list . Did you notice anyone who shouldn 't have been at the wedding ? Someone who wasn 't invited . MRS. STALLER : No . Of course , I don 't know the bride 's entire family . Although my mother-in-law she was very upset with someone before ... A man . I had never seen him before . I thought she was just having a moment . If we showed you the wedding video , would you be able to point him out ? I could try . It 's jasmine . Shelley picked out the scent . Represents happiness and love . Do you mind giving me a moment ? Of course . I 'll help you with the video . Thank you . She just said all the rest of the candles in this place are jasmine , right ? Smell that . This one 's cinnamon . [ SNIFFS ] PETER : And ? - Patience , son . Just like when you were a little boy . Your mother used to say you had ants in your pants . - Put that in the spectrometer . - Okay . That 's the man that Mrs. Staller identified . - Can you make it clearer ? - I can try . - That 's the best I can do . - All right . Upload it to the joint law enforcement database , and maybe we 'll get a hit . - All right . PETER : Walter . Come here . Take a look at this . WALTER : That is interesting . You were right . This is our toxin . Appears to be a variant of ... What is that ? Hydrogen cyanide ? And the candle would suggest that it was activated by heat . And then it dispersed into the air . Well , if it was in the air , how come it only killed some of the guests ? Good question . What ? Chemical weapons . Death by asphyxiation . The Nazis . I knew this was familiar . - The Nazis ? - The Nazis were scientific pioneers . They attempted to advance every branch of science . Molecular bombs , flying saucers , eternal youth . Before DNA was even discovered , Josef Mengele wanted to create a weapon capable of targeting specific victims . A weapon capable of picking people out in a crowd , just like what happened here . It seems that science may have finally caught up with Nazi ambition . Mrs. Staller was a Holocaust survivor . - Do you think that that 's ... ? - Relevant ? I don 't know , Olivia . Of course , I 'm not saying that this is the work of the Nazis . Nor suddenly am I convinced that this was just a murder . A wedding is the perfect laboratory . You have your target group , the Stallers . And you have your control group , everyone else . You 're saying you think this was a science experiment ? It 's a theory . And one that I think I can prove . How ? A scientist always tries to recreate his results . If I 'm right , this will happen again . WOMAN : One soy latte , one orange juice , two yogurts . - Say thank you , Jordan . - Thank you . I 'd like a cup of tea , please . And make sure the water is very hot . - Sure thing . What kind of tea ? - Oh , I don 't know . You pick . Whichever is your favorite . Oh , and please , make sure the water is very hot . So do you like her ? Mrs. Greenwalt ? Yeah , she 's nice . But she always makes us take a nap after lunch . Well , maybe you need time to get your energy back . I think Mrs. Greenwalt is the one who 's sleepy . - Heh , heh . MAN : She 's very smart , your daughter . Yeah , she is . Soon you 'll be outsmarting the teachers . We 're already there . We 're talking about skipping her up a grade . Yeah , well , don 't be in too much of a hurry . These days are precious . Soon all you will have are pictures . Hm . That smells good . Is that cinnamon ? Yeah , something like that . Nine victims . Suffocated just like the wedding in Brookline . Except unlike the Stallers , none of these people were related to each other . PETER : Might have to rework that hypothesis . Maybe this toxin isn 't transmitted genetically . WALTER : Just a theory , Peter . OLIVIA : Any surveillance ? No cameras inside or on the street . Could be why our suspect chose this place . No candles , I suppose ? Not a single one . Now , Walter , is there any other way that this toxin could be delivered ? WALTER : Any number of ways , I would think . It simply requires a heat source to disperse it into the air . - What about a cup of tea ? WALTER : Oh , yes , thank you . Oh . Oh , yes . That would work as long as the water was hot enough . Cinnamon . I want this cup dusted for prints immediately . AGENT : Yes , sir . Right away . WALTER : Peter , can you help me ? That man there . What color are his eyes ? Brown . Then I was right after all . It is a targeted toxin . They all have brown eyes . That 's the common genetic trait . Check the survivors , but I 'm sure I 'm right . It 's a good thing you weren 't here at the time , or you 'd be dead too . First it was a family . Now it 's people with brown eyes . Why is he targeting these people ? You said you think it 's an experiment . So , what ? He 's just killing these people to prove he can ? WALTER : Perhaps . I 'm going to drive us back to the lab . - I think I have an idea . - Walter . Why don 't I drive ? An idea about what . I don 't know yet . MAN : Excuse me , officer . That man over there . His name 's Bischoff ? You mean Dr. Bishop . Dr. Bishop . - Did you need something ? - No , I 'm just trying to place him . He looks just like his father . - Oh . Is that the tea cup ? - Yeah . But they could only pull a partial print . So no good to run through any databases . That 's unfortunate . But you are just in time . Just in time for what ? Show and tell , apparently . This is a molecular model of the toxin . This blue portion , that 's the deadly part . This red part , that , that 's the targeted group . In the first instance , the Staller family . Agent Farnsworth ? And in this instance , people with brown eyes . Because he can program the toxin to target whatever group he wants . Any group with common physical characteristics or genetic similarities , yes . Tall people . Short people . Fat people . Skinny people . Black people . Brown people . White people . Hey , Walter , we get it . Well , anyway , whoever created this was apparently proud of his work . Though I don 't know why he should be . I mean , apart from the genetic targeting , the toxin itself is quite rudimentary . It 's a blend of chromium trioxide and hydrogen cyanide . It 's ... Chromium trioxide . That 's highly regulated . If this guy was buying it in any quantity ... - Astrid , can you ... ? - Dig up companies that deal with chromium trioxide . So , Walter , what were you saying about him being proud of his work ? WALTER : See this ? That 's a carbon chain . It 's inert . It 's the signature of the creator . Some chemists spell out their initials in molecules , others create a symbol . Are you saying that we may be able to identify who made this ? Yes , but this could be anybody 's . Well , it looks like a stylized S or a snake . Actually , looks more like a sea horse to me . A sea horse . I suppose it could ... What is it ? [ SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] WALTER : The sea horse . I know who created this toxin . PETER : Hey , Walter . Wait , Walter . What 's going on ? They called him the Sea Horse because he was a great swimmer . PETER : Okay , good for him . Who is he ? My father . - Dr. Robert Bishop . - Wait , wait , wait . Your father ? I told you these were Nazi experiments . My father was a scientific pioneer at the University of Berlin . Yes , I know . Who came here in 1933 which is long before the Nazis ever took power . It was 1943 . Given the nature of his work , I fudged the date a little . Walter , what are you telling me ? My grandfather was a Nazi ? WALTER : Technically , yes . Actually he worked as a spy for the Allies sabotaging German research and smuggling scientific information to the Americans . I knew I recognized the experiment . I must have seen the formula in one of my father 's books . - Put this there . - Okay . You think your father helped develop the formula for this toxin ? WALTER : It would seem so . Of course , at the time , it was just theoretical . DNA itself was theoretical . But that formula has to be here somewhere . These are all my father 's favorite books . First editions of Goethe , Thomas Mann . You 're sure all those notes were hidden in German novels ? Oh , yes . It was the only way he could smuggle them out of Germany when he left . - You won 't find those books in there . WALTER : No , they will be here . - These are all the books from my library . PETER : No , they won 't . Walter , they 're not in there . I sold those books . All of them . About 10 years ago . You sold them ? Why ? I needed money . Money ? They were my books . He left them to me . He knew how dangerous they were . The odds that this has to do with your father ... The very thing that he was trying to stop , you put back into the world . - We don 't know that for sure . - Yes , we do . Of course we do . How else would whoever is doing this have gotten hold of the formula ? And because I failed to protect it , my father 's work is killing people . So the killer is using a toxin based on a formula created by Dr. Bishop 's father . PETER [ ON PHONE ] : Just another skeleton in the Bishop family closet . It 's in a book I sold . So the formula 's very complex . We believe that the killer must 've found it in one of the books . If we can trace the books , then hopefully we can find him . Then do it . Quickly . Okay . We 'll find those books . Come on , Bishop , you sold me those books , like , 10 years ago . How am I supposed to know where they are now ? Because , Markham , you 're exactly the kind of pack rat who keeps a handwritten log of every book ever sold . Such a way with words . How is it that a beautiful lady like you is stuck with this guy ? - It 's my job . - I got plenty of books on how to rethink your career . What Color is your Parachute ? Do What You Are . That 's thoughtful of you . I really need to find out who bought those books . Whoever did may be in the midst of a killing spree . Hm . Sounds serious . Give me a minute , I 'll see what I can find . What ? You didn 't really sell Walter 's books for money , did you ? Walter 's got heaps of valuable stuff . Why 'd you just sell his books ? It was a long time ago . Walter was still in St. Claire 's . I wasn 't exactly very fond of him at the time . Those books were amongst his favorite possessions . And , no , to answer your question . I 'm not proud of it . MARKHAM : They were sold last year . The name I got is Eric Franko . Lives over in Kendall Square . He struck me as a real weirdo . PETER : Coming from you , that 's saying something . I owe you one . [ SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD ] Doesn 't look like he 's here . PETER : Well why don 't we just poke around for a bit ? OLIVIA : Freeze . FBI . Get down on your knees . Don 't shoot me . Please , don 't shoot me . ERIC : I 'm not a Nazi . I 'm an artist . It 's about the banality of evil , like the Nuremberg Trials . Showing history 's tyrants as these regular schmucks . That 's deep . Where are the books you bought from Markham ? The German novels ? The ones with the creepy stuff inside ? The Alice in Wonderland meets the " evil Nazi experiment " ? Well , you 're looking at one of them . So , what do those books have to do with the FBI ? It 's a long story . So none of these have ever been displayed ? You 're the only person who 's seen them ? Sadly , the contemporary art scene has yet to , um , ahem fully recognize my particular contributions . I 'd like to get these books back . What 's left of them . I 'll pay whatever you had to . Yeah , sure , sure . It 's gonna take me a while to dig them all up but you should also know the collage is for sale . Or I could donate it . Your grandfather was a fan of modern art . But I don 't think he would 've appreciated this . I 'm sorry , Walter . Apology not accepted . Of course , this means the perpetrator didn 't get the formula from the books . No . We don 't see how he could have . Then how on earth did he re-create the formula using my father 's signature no less ? No match on the killer 's DNA , Walter . Great . More bad news . OLIVIA : Wait , I don 't understand . His DNA ? Where did you get his DNA ? Dr. Bishop was able to get some from the partial fingerprints . From the skin cells in the oil . It 's pretty amazing . WALTER : Not my best work , I 'm afraid . The telomere degradation suggested that the man was over a hundred years old which is fascinating , but not a likely possibility . Walter , you said this toxin could be programmed to target any genetic trait . - Yes . Could it target more than one ? Say , green eyes and brown hair at the same time . - Yes , I suppose it could . - What are you thinking ? [ PETER SPEAKING GERMAN ] The master race . The Nazi 's ultimate goal , purification of German people and the white race . So Nazi science for a Nazi agenda . All of Hitler 's dreams in one little toxin . MAN : Hey . What are you doing there ? I 'm conducting a test . To monitor the dispersion rate of my experiment . Please . You can watch . [ DOG BARKING ] Walter , what are you doing to those rats ? Killing them . Well , hopefully only the white ones . I thought you were trying to block the toxin . I am . But I have to replicate it before I can figure out how to stop it . Astrid couldn 't find any companies that purchased chromium trioxide . But our EPA contact suggested we search for sodium chromate ? Of course , it 's a sister compound . You treat it with sulfuric acid , you get chromium trioxide . Okay , well , here are three local buyers . Do you recognize any of them ? Well , those two , pharmaceutical companies . This one I 've never heard of . PETER : Shipping address is 3340 Eastham Rd . Newton , Mass . That 's a residential address . OLIVIA : Sir , it 's Dunham . I think we have a location . [ SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD ] AGENT 1 : Clear ! AGENT 2 : Clear ! AGENT 3 : Clear . OLIVIA : Are we clear , Agent Doble ? The area 's safe . We 're good . AGENT 1 : We got three , that 'll be great . AGENT 2 : All clear . OLIVIA : Tell tactical to stand down . [ FOOTSTEPS ] AGENT 1 : We got a double search going . AGENT 2 : Nothing over here . Makes your lab look downright homey . [ SPEAKS GERMAN ] [ SPEAKS GERMAN ] [ SPEAKS GERMAN ] PETER : Genetic traits . Eye color , hair color , skin tone . It 's the works . Creating the master race by process of elimination . OLIVIA : Guys , I think I found something . AGENT 1 : Come on , let 's go . OLIVIA : Looks like he was making some kind of ID . Walter , this is your sweater . Walter ? [ WALTER GASPING GRUNTING ] Walter . Walter . Get him out of here . We need some help downstairs ! We need that oxygen now . PETER : Breathe . Just breathe , Walter . Breathe . Breathe . MAN : Thank you , sir . - And your ID , sir ? WOMAN : Yeah , just what he said . Walter , how are you feeling ? You got me out just in time . I 'd like my sweater back . We 'll work on that , Walter . Walter , why did he go after you ? Don 't know . Perhaps he knew my father betrayed the Nazis . - You able to get that photo to Broyles ? - Yeah . He 's sending it out wide . I also found this . I know that logo . I have to check the contents of the box . MAN : Empty your pockets , please . Of course . [ SNIFFING ] All right , go ahead . It 's the World Tolerance conference at the Boston Center for Arts . Do you know who he 's planning to target ? With that broad a spectrum of genetic markers , could be anybody . - Evacuate the building . - I 'll call head of security . There are dignitaries at that conference so we need to follow protocol . - That 'll take time . - We may not have it . [ SNIFFING ] [ SNIFFING ] There are many difficulties but we must continue to confront discrimination and uphold the rights of the oppressed . The theme of this year 's conference , individual and cultural events was not chosen lightly . This organization has a proud tradition of upholding human rights and cultural diversity . Together we are committed to the promotion of tolerance . ASTRID : Walter ? Whenever you 're ready , I 'll take you home . No . I want you to take me to the Performing Arts Center . I can stop this . OLIVIA : Okay , we 're looking for the man or the mechanism . It 's gonna be something hot . A candle , a coffee urn . OLIVIA : FBI . So . Now , remember , he could be anywhere . On the floor , in balconies , anywhere . WOMAN : Should we condemn their culture ? Failure to recognize the ... Peter , there 's a candle on every table . I know . They 've been burning for so long . There 's no victims , he must be using something more potent . Walter , the conference is this way . No , Astrid , we need to take the higher ground . GATRELL [ ON RADIO ] : This is Gatrell . I 'm in the northwest corner . I got nothing . Nothing here either . Keep circulating . WOMAN : Difference of values , of religions and of lifestyles . We must take great care lest our advocacy become its own form of oppression one that unjustifiably takes sides ... PETER : Olivia , I 'm in the bar . Could be anything back here . Candles , coffee pots . It 's a disaster . Hold on a second . Peter ? Let 's hold off on those for one second . WOMAN : By recognizing room for doubt ... I think I got it . [ MAN COUGHING ] We are united by a common ... [ MAN COUGHING ] Where 's the victim ? - Okay , FBI . Everybody , move . - Move . OLIVIA : Make room . - I said move . Out of my way . I need a paramedic . [ COUGHING ] Bischoff . Traitor . [ GRUNTING ] BROYLES : Dr. Bishop . WALTER : Yes , Agent Broyles ? - What you did tonight ... - Was to use the killer 's DNA to target him , and only him , using his own toxin . If you plan to press charges , then so be it . But I don 't regret what I did . [ SIGHS ] Good night , Dr. Bishop . Olivia ? That man , he corrupted my father 's work . - I understand . - No , no , it was more than that . You see , family is very important to me . There 's nothing I wouldn 't do . - What 's this ? - It 's a present . Your father 's work . I had Franko give me everything that wasn 't totally destroyed . Oh , look , Peter . It 's your grandfather . Robert Bischoff ? That was his name . Changed it when he came over here . Your mother always said that you shared his noble brow . It 's a pity you never got to know him . You two would 've gotten along very well , I think . There is still one thing that doesn 't make any sense . If the formula for the toxin didn 't come from your father 's notes how did this guy get it ? Perhaps there 's some mysteries that are destined to remain unsolved . Thank you for bringing these back . [ ENGLISH - US - SDH ] Ripped by stlc8tr

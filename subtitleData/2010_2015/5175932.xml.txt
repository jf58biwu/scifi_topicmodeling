 Twenty years ago when the corporations bailed out our failed governments , they sold it to us as salvation ... Now we see that we paid for that rescue with our freedoms . We have awaken to the truth that we have become slaves to the Corporate Congress ... Today that all changes . Let the word go forth from this time and place , to friend and foe alike , that we have passed the torch to a new generation unwilling to permit the undoing of human rights and dignities . And let every corporation know , whether it wishes us well or ill , that we shall pay any price in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty . Don 't move ! Hands where we can see them ! Stay where you are ! I got this , Kiera . You 're under arrest . Under section 76 of the Union Code , you are charged with being the leader of the terrorist group Liberate . And conspire to plot against the Corporate Congress . You 're too late . My God ! Liberate murdered 30,000 people to kill 20 . Of course they deserve to be executed . Separate their methods from their message . For just a second . Forget it . Never happen . Because they went too far . So you do agree with them ? No , I understand them . You understand bombing the Corporate Congress and killing people ? No , I understand wanting to return to democracy again versus a corporate dictatorship . Come on , governments lost their relevance after they went belly up . So what , So we 'd be dead , or in the street , if it wasn 't for the corporate bailout ? And you wouldn 't have that ivory tower to teach out of . We 've given up representation , free speech , assembly . Seems like you 're still free to speak your mind . Alerts on corporate .. ... and CPS webs as well . Something 's up . A call to arms on the eve of the executions . They 're just trying to intimidate us . Won 't work . After tomorrow tonight , they 'll just be dead . And we 'll move on with our lives . Mom ? Are the bad guys attacking us again ? No . The bad guys are in prison . And pretty soon they will never be able to hurt anyone again . Do you have to go ? Yeah , it 's my job . For me ? For tomorrow , in case you need back up . Thank you . First execution in 40 years . You should be proud you got the assignment . Thanks . ... check in your sector . Please confirm I.D. Hang on . Looks like you 're up . Won 't take long . You 're a suspect in a crime . Maintain your position . CPS Eight Eleven . Suspect recog . Uploading . That 's a match . Tyler Killen . Property damage . Book and process . You 're tagged , Mr. Killen . Report to a CPS station for booking , or face the pain . And bring your little friend here with you . You too . You better clean up your acts , or you 'll be permanent visitors at this place . Take my advice ... You want to leave this world with your dignity and your emotions intact . That 's what your followers would want , and more importantly that 's what I want . Do we understand each other ? We just received credible information that Liberate 's plan is to attack the execution chamber itself . Back up Prison Security . Stay alert . Change of plan Kiera , you 're with Elena and the Chamber . Rest of you with me . What do you think Greg ? Circus or justice ? You don 't believe every one in the world needs to see this . I would have preferred something a little less public . But the surviving members of the board insisted . The board is right . We need to take an eye for an eye . Execute them as a deterrent . Curtis Chen . Jasmine Garza . Lucas Ingram . Stephan Jawarski . Edward Tagami . Matthew Kellogg . Travis Burka . Sonia Ballentine . Kiera ... You have been convicted of crimes against the Union and sentenced to death . All appeals have been exhausted . There will be no cogitation . Prisoners , take your positions on the table . What the hell ? He 's got something ! Kiera ! CONTINUUM S01 Ep01 - A Stitch in Time CPS , this is Cameron . CPS ? Anyone ? What the hell ... Where am I ? Come on , man , let 's go ! CPS ! Maintain your position ! Ingram ! Central . This is Cameron . I need back up ! Who is this ? CPS Officer Cameron . Respond one . I 'm separated from my team . I need back up . Some weird shit is going down . CP ... ? Look . This is an experimental , encrypted frequency . How did you find this channel ? What ? Is this the same MIT hacker who is creeping my fire-wall ? If it is , I am so going to bust you ! This is a security net you idiot . You 're in violation . Nice try . I don 't care who you are or what you think , but I need back-up at this location . Now ! Location ? Holy shit , it works . But it shouldn 't ... This is impossible . UGH ! Start talking . Not to you . You shot me up with Torox ? Bitch . What happened back there , Lucas ? Where are we ? What did you guys do ? Time jump . The vortex . You were there ... Now you 're here . Where ? Where is here ? Same place we started . Place , not time . Space , not time . Get it ? Where is the prison ? Not where is the prison . Where the prison will be . Should have been six years looks like 60 . Would have been a sweet escape . How do we get back ? How do I get home ? You are home . What happens now ? We become ghosts . We blend in and you 're no one is going to find us . Watch me . Here ya go ! RISE UP BROTHERS ! JOIN THE FIGHT ! Drop the weapon ! Drop it ! Hands on your head ! You alone ? Nope . I 'm with her . Nice try . I can 't lie ... I 'm on a drug . You don 't say ? A truth serum . I 've never been in an automobile . Then this is your lucky day . One down , seven to go . Hello ? I heard that . I know you 're still there . I was listening ... One down , seven to go ... I heard everything ... My question is , how ? I haven 't put the tech your talking on into circulation yet , so how the hell do you have it ? Isn 't somebody going to explain to me what just happened ? Well , Lucas is the only one who can tell us but he 's not here . What about Kagami ? He didn 't make it through . We 'll be okay without him . Knock yourselves out ! How can this be happening ? Mister Buddy back there was talking about time jumping . Time traveler ... Hello ? If I 'm in the past , how are you in my head ? How are you on my computer ? Who is this ? My name 's Alec . Alec . What year is this ? 2012 . NO ! I have a son . He has to see his dentist tomorrow . We were going to go to Lemurs' concert this weekend . It 's my anniversary next month . It is not 2012 . What year are you from ? 2077 . You are not from 2077 ! Why would I lie about it ? If that 's true , then you are screwed . A bone handle ! Our division commander had one of these . Never liked that guy . Nice shot . I missed . Where the hell am I ? You 're at the corner of Pender and Beatty .

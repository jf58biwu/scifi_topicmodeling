 Clarke , voice-over : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face , Or breathed real air or floated in water . None of us have . For 3 generations , The ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive . But now our home is dying , And we are the last hope of mankind . 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us was sent here before we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested- - By the earth , by the secrets it hides , And most of all , by each other . Announcer : Previously on " the 100 " ... Calm down ! We 're dead to them ! And we 're alone ! You 're not alone ! You 're not alone . Raven ! Finn ! Raven : The council is voting whether to kill 300 people To save air . We have to tell them ! The radio 's gone . [ woman crying ] Mom , please , let me get a doctor . No ! You can 't tell anyone . Tell me what happens if you do . Say it . Y-you get floated . I don 't understand . Why is it wrong to have more than one baby ? The ark couldn 't survive . The chancellor can 't allow it . He 's , like , the emperor augustus , right ? That 's right . Just like the emperor we read about . The baby 's coming . Get the blanket . [ groans ] [ baby crying ] My brave boy . You have a sister . You should name her . Augustus had a sister . Octavia . [ fussing ] Bellamy , you can 't let her cry . Here . Give her to me . No , mom , mom , you can 't fall asleep . I 'm so tired . Your sister . Your responsibility . Mom , mom , what do I do ? Mom ! [ crying ] Shh . Please . Shh . See ? I told you . It 's ok . I won 't let anything bad happen to you , octavia . I promise . Octavia ! You 're up ? Yeah . Knowing that hundreds of people Might be dying on the ark Makes it pretty hard to sleep . Raven 's flares will work . Her radio would 've worked better . Have you seen octavia ? No . It 's octavia . She 's probably chasing butterflies . Clarke , I 've checked the camp . She 's not here . Ok . I 'll help you find her . Let 's check again . You go to the dropship . I 'll check the rest of the tents . Thank you . Don 't thank me . I 'm not doing this for you . I 'm doing it for octavia . [ groaning ] [ groaning ] [ groaning ] Uhh . [ footsteps ] Aah ! Aah ! Please , please don 't hurt me . Please don 't--no- - aah ! No ! No , please ! No ! No ! Aah ! Bellamy : Hey , everybody , gather around And grab a weapon . My sister 's been out there alone for 12 hours . Arm up . We 're not coming back without her . Hey , jasper , you don 't have to do this . You haven 't left camp since we brought you back . Clarke , I need to do this . We need all the people we can get . We need a tracker . Finn . Get out here . You want to lose an ear ? Can 't believe you let it get so long in lockup . This couldn 't wait till morning ? I was inspired . So . What did you want to talk about ? Nothing . It can wait . That wasn 't your " nothing " face . That was your " going on a spacewalk " face . No more spacewalks . Get some rest , ok ? Man : Finn , we 're leaving . Finn : All right . I 'm coming . Hey . Hey , wait . Nice hair . We should talk about this . You have a girlfriend , finn . There 's really nothing left to say . Hey , hold on . It 's true . I care about raven . But you and me , we started something . It 's nothing we can 't stop . Are you sure ? Because I 'm not . Man : Guys , guys . Come here ! Did you see that ? Look up there . It 's so beautiful . Raven : They didn 't work . They didn 't see the flares . Bellamy : A meteor shower tells you that ? It 's not a meteor shower , it 's a funeral . Hundreds of bodies being returned to the earth from the ark . This is what it looks like from the other side . They didn 't get our message . This is all because of you ! I helped you find the radio . Yeah , after you jacked it From my pod and trashed it ! Yeah , he knows . Now he has to live with it . All I know is that my sister is out there And I 'm gonna find her . You coming or what ? Yeah . What are we waiting for ? Move out ! Clarke : We have to talk to them . 300 won 't be enough . The oxygen level will just keep dropping . And if we don 't tell them that They can survive down here , They 'll kill more people . They have to . Guys ... They 're leaving . We gotta go . I gotta do this . And you should stay and fix the radio , ok ? Fix it ? The transmitter 's smashed . Unless there 's a parts depot down here , We 're not talking to the ark . Art supply store . I know a place you might be Able to get a transmitter . Great . It looks like You 're coming with me instead . Finn ? We 're not gonna find her without you . Be careful . Hey . I love you . I love you , too . It 's this way . [ gasping ] Hello ? Is anybody here ? He fixed it ? Uhh . Uhh ! Uhh ! Look ! Over here ! What is it ? Right there . You see it ? Is that octavia 's ? Rope . What are you doing ? We need the rope to get back up . Flashlight . [ breathing heavily ] It 's hers . Bellamy : I 'm going all the way down . Someone else was here . The prints are deeper going that way . He was carrying her . If they took her , she 's alive . Like when they took me . Aah ! [ gasping ] I don 't speak grounder ... But I 'm pretty sure this means keep out . Man : Let 's get out of here . It 's crazy . Different man : I 'm outta here . Different man : Yeah , me , too . Different man : I 'm out . Go back if you want . My sister , my responsibility . I 'd walk into hell to find her . I think we just did . [ octavia laughs ] Go ! I want another pony ride . You want another one ? Ha ha ! Ok , you want to go through the jungle Or the forest ? I want to see the ark , bell . Take me out the door . That 's enough . Both of you . It 's time . But--no . I don 't want to ! How do you even know ? Yeah , mom , tell us why you 're Never surprised by surprise inspections . Mind yourself , bellamy blake . Tell your sister what happens If they find her . She knows what happens . You 've told her a thousand times . Oh . You know the drill . I hate the drill . Sometimes I wish I was never even born . Stop it , octavia . I know you 're afraid , but fear is a demon . Close your eyes and tell yourself That you are not afraid . That is how you slay the demon . [ knocking on door ] Say it . I 'm not afraid . Ok . [ knocking on door ] [ knocking on door ] Man : Open the door , now ! [ hatch closes ] Miss blake , by authority of the council , We 're here to perform a random inspection . Aurora : Inspector grus , it 's good to see you . Your uniform 's ready . There you go . Just like new . Do you have something for me ? Bellamy 's letter of recommendation . You think you 're guard material , kid ? Come here . Let 's have a look at you . I 'm good , thanks . Bellamy . Stand up . Now . I 'm not afraid . I don 't think so . You want to be in the guard or not ? Come here . 3 seconds . 1 ... 2 ... Bellamy ! I 'm so sorry , inspector . I- - grus : Don 't be . Maybe the guard will make a man out of him . Clean that up . Sir . Come to my quarters later . He 'll get that recommendation . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . [ breathing heavily ] I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . They 're so beautiful . Clarke : Raven , I know you just got here yesterday , But we don 't have time for this . Come on . Hurry up and save the world . You 're just like your mom . I 'm nothing like my mom . Relax . That 's a compliment . Abby 's a badass . The pod was her idea . It broke her heart not being able to Come down with me , But she never stopped believing you were alive . Yeah . Mother of the year . Well , my mom was awol most of my life . When she did show up , it was empty-handed . Pretty sure she had me just to trade in My rations for moonshine . How 'd you survive ? Boy next door . Finn . He shared his rations . Remembered my birthday . Saved my life . He 's my family . [ hatch opens ] [ sighs ] I got nothing . We lost the trail . Keep looking . Wandering around aimlessly isn 't the way to find your sister . We should backtrack ... I 'm not going back . Hey , where 's john ? I just saw him a second ago . Spread out . He couldn 't have gotten that far . They use the trees . We shouldn 't have crossed the boundary . Now can we go back ? There . Another one . We should run . Let 's try this one . How did you find this place ? I didn 't . Finn found it . Hey , will this work ? Sweet . Rf . Radio frequency . If we can just find the controller , We 'll be golden . All right . Finn made this . Huh ? Oh , uh , yeah . Uh , we saw this two-headed deer Our first day on the ground . Welcome to paradise , right ? Got it . Finn always does that . Finds the beauty in the unexpected . Good to go ? Hurry up and save the world , right ? Yeah . We 're good . Ok . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Man : What are we gonna do ? They keep heading us off . Second man : Just keep running . Jasper : I can 't run much longer ! Diggs : I 'm not stopping for him ! I 'm sick of running anyway . Hey , what are you doing ? They know where she is . Roma : Diggs , where are you ? Diggs : Roma ! [ breathing heavily ] Aah ! Bellamy : Wait ! Roma . Finn : Could be more . Stop . They were leading us here . It 's the only direction we could run in . Hey . Where 'd they go ? After roma . Woman : Aah ! Aah ! Oh . You 'll never guess what 's about to happen . Inspection . I 'll get in the hole . No , no , no , no , no . Sit , sit . This is great . Please , bell , I don 't want to hear About another amazing moonrise When I 'm never gonna be able to see one . You 're going to see one right now . The unity day masquerade dance Starts in 10 minutes . Now , I didn 't want to say anything Until I was sure my cadet unit Was working security . I 'm gonna be there watching you The entire time . This is real ? How do I look ? [ giggles ] Mysterious . Oh , bell , what about mom ? Hey , will you stop worrying ? We 'll be back before she even knows you 're gone . Want to go for a walk ? It 's ok . [ indistinct chatter ] [ upbeat music playing ] Whoa . Who 's that ? Another girl who won 't notice us . Uhh . My leg . I need to rest . Thank you . You saved my life . That girl back there , I knew her , So , if she 's here , then so is my brother . Please , you have to help him , too . They 'll kill him . You don 't understand me , do you ? Great . Why are you taking care of me ? You found me at the bottom of that ravine . Fixed my knee . What the hell are you doing ? Please don 't do this . Aah ! Stop it ! No , stop it ! Stop ! Please ! Please don 't do this . [ crying ] There she is . Roma ! They 're playing with us . She only came because of me . They can kill us whenever they want . Then they should get it over with ! Come on ! We know you 're out there ! You want to kill us ... Bellamy ! [ horn blowing ] They 're leaving . [ horn ] That horn . What does it mean ? Acid fog . [ horn ] We have to run . There 's no time . [ upbeat music playing ] Boy : Nice eyes . What station are you from ? [ music stops ] Woman on p.A. : Solar flare alert . An x-class solar flare has begun On the starboard side of the ark . All citizens must report to the nearest shelter zone immediately . This is not a test . This is a solar flare alert . Bell , I need to get home ! You will . Ladies and gentlemen , you know the drill . Masks off . I.D. Chips out . Bell , what do we do ? Listen to me . Whatever happens , You get back home and get under the floor . You 'll be safe there from the flare , like always . What are you gonna do ? Create a distraction . Go on . Bell , how do I get home ? Cadet blake . Why is your weapon out ? Mask off . Sir , she 's--she 's fine . I already scanned her . You don 't have a scanner . I.D. , please . Please , lieutenant shumway , I 'm begging you , she needs to leave . As a fellow guardsman ... Just let us walk out of here And I 'll do anything you want . Anything . You 're not a guardsman yet , cadet . I.D. Now . Man : Stop her . How long are we supposed to wait ? Will this even work ? We 'll find out . No , we won 't . There 's no fog . Finn : Maybe it was a false alarm . They 're coming back . I think he 's alone . Now can we run ? He doesn 't see us . I 'm going after him . And what ? Kill him ? No . Catch him . Make him tell me where octavia is , Then kill him . How do we know he 's not Leading us to another trap ? We don 't . How 's it coming ? Are you ok ? You hardly said a word The whole way back from the bunker . [ clatter ] Raven ... Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me finn didn 't make this for you . Tell me you weren 't screwing my boyfriend As I was risking my ass to come down here . I can 't tell you that . He made one for me , too . Just in case you thought you were special . Do you think I wanted this ? I didn 't even know you existed . Look , as far as he knew , you were dead , raven . Or you would have been soon enough . My mom , too , and everyone We ever knew on the ark , And there was nothing we could do to stop it . He could 've waited more than 10 days . Ahh . [ exhales ] Do you love him ? I hardly know him . [ clatter ] Uhh ! Uhh ! [ footsteps ] Bellamy ? Octavia . Get the key . [ puff ] Monroe , watch the entrance . It 's ok . You 're ok . [ knocking on door ] Cadet blake . It 's janitor blake now , lieutenant . Commander . A lot 's changed in the past year . May I ? You 've got some nerve coming here After pushing the button that floated my mother . I was following orders . What the hell do you want from me ? You were a hell of a guardsman , bellamy , you know that ? Smart , hardworking , resourceful . I wasn 't a guardsman . That 's what you said . I remember . You also said you 'd do anything to protect your sister . I remember , too . I hope that 's still true . Is she ok ? What I 'm about to tell you is classified . Chancellor jaha has approved A mission to earth . He 's sending the juvenile prisoners to the ground . 100 of them . Your sister included . N-no . You can 't . It 's not safe . You have to stop them . I wish I could . What I can do is get you A seat on that dropship . You 're right . It 's doubtful Those kids will survive , but if you 're there , At least octavia won 't be alone . What do I have to do ? Kill the chancellor . How about I kill you instead ? Kill me and your sister goes alone To a radiation-soaked planet And you get floated like your mother . Ship launches in 20 minutes , bellamy . If you 're gonna do this , we have to leave . Right now . How did you find me ? Followed him . We should go . Now . Before he wakes up . He 's not gonna wake up . Bellamy , stop . He didn 't hurt me . Let 's just go . They started this . Finn . Move . Foghorn . [ men grunting ] Stop ! That 's my brother ! [ thud ] Jasper : Clarke ! Where 's clarke ? Get clarke now . Hey . I 'm here . What 's up ? Octavia . Finn . Finn ? Oh , my god . Oh , oh , my god . Oh , my god . He 's alive . Bellamy wouldn 't let me take the knife out . Clarke : Get him in the dropship now . Go ! Clarke , can you save him ? No . Not me . I need my mother . I need to talk to her . There 's still no radio . Raven , fix it ! Go ! Hey , you ok ? Ok . Yeah . Just go . Hey , hey . Why were you defending him ? Because he saved my life . That spear that hit roma was actually meant- - No , you 're wrong . I saved your life . For all you know , he was keeping you alive To use you as bait for one of their traps . No . I don 't think so . You don 't think , o ! That 's the problem . They killed 3 of our people today . And if you would 've let me kill him When I had the chance , Finn wouldn 't be in there dying right now . Stop blaming me for your mistakes . What happened to finn is not my fault . I wanted to leave , so if finn dies in there , That 's on you . Everything that 's gone wrong Is because of you . You got me locked up on the ark . You wanted me to go to that stupid dance . You got mom killed ! Me ? [ sniffles ] Mom was floated for having you . She 's dead because you 're alive . That was her choice . I didn 't have a choice . My life ended the day you were born . Where do you think you 're going ? You can 't keep me locked up in here forever . Get inside . Go ! A storm 's coming .

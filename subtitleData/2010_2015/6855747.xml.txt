 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : You are looking through a window into another world . An alternate universe just like ours . And in each of them , there is a version of us . We can 't let Peter die again . ELIZABETH : Walter , Peter is dead . I 'm talking about the other Peter . The one on the other side . Crossed into another universe and took a son that wasn 't mine . I 'm going to be waiting for you right here . - Bring him back to me . - I promise . Hold on tight , son . PETER : You 're not my father , are you ? Of course I am . Peter . Peter ? Darling , it 's lunch . Peter ! ( PANTING ) Peter . Peter ! Peter . Oh , God . Peter . Oh , God . No ! Peter , no , please . No ! Peter , please ! Oh , God , please . No . Please , don 't . Oh , please . Oh , no ! No ! Get off of me ! You 're not my mother . I want to go home . Get off ! You 're not my mother . I want to go home . Fringe s3e15 Subject 13 WALTER : Okay , children , let 's begin . That 's it . Now , close your eyes . I want you to ignore everything except the sound of my voice . Try to relax . Clear your minds . We discussed that your imagination can take you anywhere you want to go . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know what Snuggles will do if we go somewhere . Just put him on your feet and he 'll come with us , Nick . Olivia , how can you concentrate if you 're talking ? Now , close your eyes , dear . Now , concentrate . Imagine this world slipping away . Excuse me , Dr. Bishop . Your wife is on the phone . WALTER : Tell her I 'll call her back later . Well , she said to tell you that she 's here , in Jacksonville . Is it Thursday , Miss Ashley ? Isn 't Thursday early day this week ? ( WALTER LAUGHS ) Well , I 'm gonna go home . And you can too . ( CHILDREN CHEERING ) ASHLEY : Okay , guys . Get your backpacks . Ben , yours is in the corner . And , Jen , don 't forget your violin on purpose again , okay ? ( ELIZABETH CRYING ) Where is he ? Of course the Dodgers play for Los Angeles . No , they don 't . They play in Brooklyn and I 've seen them . And the Red Lantern isn 't supposed to be green . - I 've never had a baseball mitt . Never . WALTER : Peter . You were very sick for a very long time . It must have confused you , mixed up your memories , son . Do not call me that . I am not your son . - Peter ... - You 're not my father ! And she is not my mother ! You are not my father ! ELIZABETH : Hey , hey . PETER : Get off of me ! You 're not my mother . I wanna go home . Shh , shh . Everything is okay . Hey . Hey . He 's asleep . We can 't keep this up . It 's making him crazy . What 's the alternative ? Tell him the truth ? He 'd be locked up . These lies were supposed to be a temporary measure . We were supposed to have him home well before it got this far . - It 's been six months , Walter . - Getting him back wasn 't as simple as I hoped . You 're working , but I 'm with him . - Elizabeth , I think this series of ... - I 'm with him all the time . I can 't watch him suffer like this . What if you made a device ? Like the one you used to bring him over ? We have been through this . That would be catastrophic . The texture of the universe is changed from my crossing . - It cannot withstand any more damage . - Neither can he , Walter . He is in such distress . He looks at me and he doesn 't trust me . - I 'm his mother , but no matter what I ... - Elizabeth , Elizabeth . You are not his mother . He 's a little boy very much like our son . - And we saved his life . - You . You . You saved his life . I 'm just trying to keep him alive . - I won 't keep lying to him . - Elizabeth ... It 's not vanity . I can 't keep him safe if he doesn 't trust me . Please . Just a little more time . I told you , I think the children are the key . The children should be able to cross over . And when they do , they can take Peter safely home with them . He can ride on their feet . Just give me a little more time . Please . MAN : Damn it , Olivia . When I say go to bed , I mean go to bed . Don 't you run from me . Come here ! Get your butt back in ever run from me ! ELIZABETH : Hey , I 'm really glad you got some sleep . Peter . You really think I don 't know that you 're not my mother ? - Please , can we just ... ? - You think I can 't tell ? How many more questions am I gonna have to get right before you believe me ? We 've been doing this for two months now . - I told you the name of your hamster ... - You got some wrong . Yes , and maybe that 's because you were confused because you were so ill . He makes you say that , doesn 't he ? Because he 's the one who stole me . Stole you from where , Peter ? From the other world at the bottom of the lake . - Love ... - I know that I sound crazy . But I 'm not . Okay ? I 'm not crazy . Peter , let 's just , um ... Let 's just get out of the house today , okay ? Let 's just get some air . You look gray , which is not , technically , a skin color . - Another sleepless night ? - Yes , I suppose so . I 'm not finished with these . I want to organize a sub-group data ... There 's no need . I have something else in mind . I want to separate the children . - Begin independent testing . ASHLEY : Okay . Any particular order ? What 's Olivia doing inside ? Well , she didn 't have a very good night either . Olivia , why don 't you go outside and play with the others ? Olive , what happened to your eye ? Ashley said that you told her that you fell . Running in my house . Olive , you can trust me . - If someone is hurting you ... - I said I fell , okay ? I fell . That 's all . May I ? Olive , why did you draw this ? Did you see it in a book ? Where , then ? Was it last night ? When you fell ? ELIZABETH : You know , tulips don 't usually grow in areas like this . Well , then what are they doing here ? ELIZABETH : A professor who was working here missed them . So he imagined a tulip that would grow in this climate and he invented it . He used his brain and his imagination to turn the world into what he wanted it to be . How would you change the world if you could , Peter ? What would you wish for ? I wouldn 't make stupid flowers grow . What would you do ? I 'd go home . Couple of more errands and then I 've got a surprise in store for you . Peter . Now , listen , can I trust you not to run off on me ? Okay . Go and pick a toy , then . Go on . That 's a strange game . What 's that called ? It 's called " Joust . " I suspect her crossing over was triggered by an extreme emotional response . - Her black eye ? - So we need to design a series of experiments ... - ... around emotional flexibility . - Hey . Hey . I wanted to show Peter where you worked . WALTER : Hey , Peter . Hey , hello . Look at that airplane . That 's a DC-3 , yeah ? Aha . The beguiling Olivia Dunham beguiles . ASHLEY : Peter , I was about to go get a snack . Would you like to come get something ? - Yeah , go on , Peter . - Okay . ASHLEY : Come on , let 's go . WALTER : We 've had a promising development . I think young Olivia may have crossed over . - If I 'm right and she has ... - Then she can take Peter home . I knew you 'd find a way . Well , I still have to work out precisely how she does it but we 're nearly there . WALTER ( ON RECORDING ) : William , I need your help . I have reason to believe Subject 13 , Olivia Dunham has been able to cross over to the Other Side . I believe that young Olivia may need to be in some kind of heightened emotional state to access her ability . I am compiling some recordings on my new Betamax . Perhaps you 'll be able to see something I cannot . WALTER : Okay , Olivia . You feeling comfortable ? - I 'm fine . - These wires will show me how you respond to the tests . I 'll just ... Test Series Alpha . I 'll be monitoring vitals , theta rhythm stable neocortex . All right ? That 's it . ( OLIVIA LAUGHS ) You 're doing very well , there , Olive . These four brothers grew up to be great warriors . But they were very special because they had the power of metamorphosis . Metamorphosis ? He could turn into a hawk watching for invaders from on high . This one a cheetah , and the fire of a dragon . Minimal response to joy . ... Rhythms have a slight bump but not within our range . - Can I stop now ? - Not yet , dear , you need to keep going . ... Longer , Olivia . You 're doing really well . Heart beat of 140 beats per minute , 30 minute ... No response to exhilaration . - It doesn 't fit . - Try . Look at each piece carefully . No , you 'll have to start again . Come on . - It doesn 't fit , Dr. Walter . - Try it . Faster . Come on , come on . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . That 's wrong . Concentrate , Olivia ! No ! I 'm not working on this anymore . WALTER : Minimal activity in the stable neocortex . Anger isn 't the answer . Loneliness isn 't the answer either . Perhaps fear . ... show you a movie . It 's one of my favorites . It 's called Jaws . It 's ... It 's a bit scary , but I think you can handle it . I 'm sorry . That 's all right . - Ready to start the movie ? - No , no , no . No , let 's ... Let 's take a little break . Let 's get that off you . You don 't need that . It started to occur to me , William , that fear by itself wasn 't the answer . ( OLIVIA PANTING ) OLIVIA : Walter ? Let me out ! Please , let me out ! MAN ( WHISPERING OVER SPEAKER ) : There 's no one here . There 's no one here . OLIVIA : Who 's there ? Is someone there ? ( SCREAMING ) PETER : Approaching the building , requesting clearance to dock . ( SIRENS WAILING ) ( BUSY SIGNAL BEEPING ) ELIZABETH : Love , come and get your coat , will you ? I don 't think Olive thought the joke was very funny . No , I suppose not . There you go . Nick , please wait outside with the children . ASHLEY : Dr. Bishop ... WALTER : Just a minute , Ashley . We 're obviously on the right track . The part of Olivia 's brain that let her do this must be the same part that lets her cross between universes . - But I 'm still missing something . - Dr. Bishop , we have another problem . Please get your backpack on , okay ? Good night . ELIZABETH : Ashley , what 's going on ? There 's been a small fire , but everything 's under control . Ashley ? One of the children have gone missing , a girl , Olivia Dunham . Your husband and the others are looking . - I 'm sure everything 's going to be fine . - Okay . All right . Thank you . Peter , come inside with me . Peter , will you wait here for me for a minute ? Okay , good boy . I 'll be back in a sec . Elizabeth . - Did you find her ? - No , we haven 't yet . This little girl , Olivia , Walter , it says that you think her stepfather is hitting her . " William , I believe the ideal environment ... " ... for transition across universes may be a return to her home . " The unique combination of love and terror stimulates a cortical reaction . " A , they are notes . B , yes . The unique combination of love and terror does stimulate a cortical reaction that may be the key to her crossing over . And if she is not allowed to return to her home to re-stimulate the pathways ... You mean to be terrorized again . Then it could well take me years to simulate the state artificially . Walter , you said that this was just a theory . Surely there 's got to be some other way . And if there isn 't ? This is not about you and me and Peter anymore . Don 't you see what I 've done ? I crept over in the night and I stole their child . And if we don 't return him , they 'll figure it out and they 'll come after him , after us . I know . Because that 's what I would do . So you would sacrifice one for the other . This little girl , Olivia , for Peter . No . But for thousands of others or millions it would have to be considered . Walter . Oh , I 'm sorry . I was looking for Peter . He told me he 's never had peanut MM 's before . Oh , he 's out by the cubbies . No , I just looked there . He ... Peter ? Peter ? WOMAN ( ON TV ) : It 's been six months since Peter Bishop disappeared but authorities still have no ideas . The sympathy of the world goes out to Dr. Walter Bishop and his devoted wife as the entire nation remains aghast at the kidnapping of their only son . Dr. Bishop , the architect of the famed Star Wars Defense System that protects our nation , and his wife made an ... This isn 't doing you any good . Don 't turn it off now . They were about to point out how ironic it is that the safety czar couldn 't protect his own child . Walter , I 'm serious , you can 't keep doing this . You can 't keep drinking yourself into oblivion . You have a better suggestion about what I should be doing ? Not this . Should I give up on my son ? The way the police seem to have ? Dinner 's ready in 20 . I 'm not hungry . That 's fine . You still need to eat . If nothing else , you need to put something in your stomach to absorb all that alcohol . You said he was wearing a beige sweater . The man who took my son . You said he was wearing a beige sweater . Not a suit like I would wear . - Walter , please don 't do this . - How did he sound ? His voice . I have a new theory . Plastic surgery . There are surgeons skilled enough to pull off a feat of this magnitude but the voice ... The voice would be tricky . You know what ? Maybe it was plastic surgery or an alien able to take on any shape he wanted . We 've considered all your theories , Walter and none of them have brought our son back . It happened . It just happened . And it 's inexplicable . Nothing is inexplicable , Elizabeth . Science is seen as magic by primitives . Something happened in this house and we have to go over it and over it until we find out what we 're missing . How will this time be different ? We don 't know . We have to go over it . I have . I 've thought back . I 've gone over it again and again . I have told you and a dozen policemen every detail that I can remember about that night . I 've had hypnotherapy to try and recover every detail I couldn 't . I know . And I believe you about all of it . But there has to be something we 've overlooked . There has to be an explanation . You fly to Florida every Monday , you work all week and then you come back and we do this . This is not a marriage anymore . It 's a routine . Please , Elizabeth , one more time . He 's my boy . I can 't lose him . I 'm so sorry , my love . I know I can 't keep doing this . But it 's impossible impossible he 's gone . I know . I know , Walter . I spend every waking moment imagining where he is what he 's doing . And I pray that wherever he is , he 's safe . That someone 's taking good care of him . And that someday , by some miracle I will get to see him again . But until that miracle happens , I can 't break . I need to be here for him . We need to be here for him . But we won 't , Walter . We 're breaking . Our marriage , this is breaking us . And I can 't let that happen . I need you , my love . I 've lost Peter I can 't bear to lose you too . Don 't go to work tomorrow . Stay home this week . Forget the lab , forget Florida . Let 's put our marriage back together . Welcome back , sir . Morning , Dr. Bishop . Morning . Dr. Bishop , it 's almost dark and there 's still no sign of either of them . I found this . It 's Olivia 's . Hi . Hi . How 'd you find me ? I guess tulips don 't normally grow around here . But how 'd you know I 'd come here ? Because it 's the only drawing that looked happy . My name 's Peter . Mine 's Olivia . Don 't . Be careful . I 'm not scared . What happened ? My step-dad did it . So everyone 's looking for you . I messed up . Now he 's gonna send me home . Who ? Dr. Walter . Did you tell him ? Walter , I mean , about your step-dad hitting you ? I don 't think he 'd do anything . My mom ... My mom was telling me you gotta imagine how you want things to be . And then you can try and change them . Do you trust him ? Walter ? You should tell him . You gotta try something , right ? I think I cooled off by now . Did you imagine that ? The last time we saw her was before 5 . We went looking ourselves , but it got dark . Your son and the girl know each other ? No . He 's not from here . He doesn 't even know the area . ( ASHLEY GASPS ) ASHLEY : Look , they 're back . Peter ! ASHLEY : Olivia , where were you ? ELIZABETH : Oh , God . Oh , my God . Are you all right ? Yeah ? Come on , let 's get you inside . - Please . MAN : Okay . ASHLEY : Okay . Thank you . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . Okay , your stepfather 's on his way . Olivia , sweetie , we were all so worried about you . What were you thinking ? I want to see Dr. Walter . - You can see him tomorrow , your step ... - No ! I have to see him now . Olivia , you can 't see him now , okay ? He 's ... Olivia , you ... My stepfather did this . He hits me . That 's when I crossed over to the other universe . Look . That 's where I saw the blimps . Just like you said . They were in the sky in the other universe . Can you make him stop hitting me ? Please . WALTER : Olive ? Olivia what is it ? What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry , Dr. Bishop . I hope our little princess hasn 't caused you too much trouble . No trouble at all . Come on , Olivia . I 've been worried sick . Let 's get you home . Before you go I want you to understand that this girl is very special to me . And if anything harmful should happen to her anything to frighten her or make her uncomfortable in the least I will not hesitate to inform Social Services . In which case , I have certain government friends who could insure that you 'll be facing significant troubles for yourself . Do you understand me ? Dear , you go home and get some rest . And we 'll see if we can figure out a new way tomorrow . All right ? - I 'm sorry . - Hm ? When I ran off , I 'm sorry if I scared you . Peter , it 's ... I 'm never going back am I ? Listen to me . Sometimes the world we have is not the world we want . But we have our hearts and our imaginations to make the best of it . I will promise you this . I will be the best mother I possibly can be to you . I 'll take care of you . I will protect you . And I 'll never let anyone take you away from me . No one , not ever . But you 're not her . Are you ? You 're not my real mother . You were sick . You were very sick for a long , long time . And I think it confused you . Yes . I am your mother . Of course I am . Now you go off and wash your hands for dinner , okay ? Okay Mom . ELIZABETH ( OVER SPEAKERPHONE ) : Hello ? Elizabeth , it 's me . I know where our son is . I know where Peter was taken .

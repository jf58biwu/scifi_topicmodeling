 - Previously on warehouse 13 ... That 's an artifact from warehouse 12 . I thought there was just one of those . - Very good , gentlemen . What is benedict valda doing here ? He died in egypt in a pit of fire . - He 's replicating artifacts . 11 . There should be 12 . This portal opens to the regent sanctum in china . We both know it wouldn 't have worked . why do you say that ? Because you 're in love with myka . - What happened to claire ? Your sister was infected by the music box . The only solution was oliver sacks 's record player . It keeps her in a perpetual coma . What happened ? Where 's claire ? - She 's gone . Did I do this ? I tried to cure claire . Did I somehow make her worse ? If I did , I swear to god ... No ! This is not your fault . - But what if it is ? What if I woke something up inside her , Something more dangerous than what was already there ? Trust me , we 're gonna find her . But , claudia , I need you present . I need you focused . Claire needs you . - Okay . All right . Well , she couldn 't have woken up by herself , Not with sacks 's record player keeping her in a coma , Which , by the way , is also gone . Nice security in this place . Well , you might 've noticed that when you broke in . Obviously , somebody hacked into their video surveillance system , Probably the same way that you did when you broke in . Well , then , somebody should run a diagnostic Of their entire security system , shouldn 't they ? - Mm . Without sacks 's record player keeping her in check , Claire would 've trashed this place , right ? - Yeah . Had to keep her attached to the record player . But who even knew she was here , Much less wanted to break her out ? Well , let 's have a look , shall we ? Good . Spectrometer covers five hours , so claire was still here . We can ... - We can fast forward . Good , I want to see that son of a bitch I 'm gonna put in the ground for this . There . Who 's that ? That 's impossible . It 's ... - benedict valda . - Time to rise and shine . - Who are you ? What is this thing ? - That won 't come off . It allows me to control your prodigious powers , miss donovan . You 'll do exactly what I say . - Like hell I will . - Calm down . Calm down . Get up . Come . - No . - Good . You will do as I say . Yes . You and I are going to do great things , miss donovan . Â¶ So valda is alive . He 's alive . How come valda didn 't die in warehouse 2 ? So why wait three years to show up ? This is not the valda that we knew . If my theory is correct , then this is the valda ... From the alternate time continuum . Great . The nazi valda . Fine . - Pete , put it back ! Wow , I never knew it did that . Cool . - Stop touching things ! - Right . So how did that valda get into our time continuum ? I suspect he took one out of my bag while I was his prisoner And he used it to prevent himself from becoming erased . So now that he 's here , what 's he gonna do ? Well , this new valda , he 's from a militaristic world Where ruthless experimentation In the name of scientific progress , that was the norm . - And he 's got my sister . I just got her back . I 'm not about to lose her To some psycho from another dimension . When I get my hands on him , I 'm gonna snap off ... Use that energy to figure out why he took her . Fine , but I 'm doing it angrily . - Like that . - Oh , my god . Guess who 's been hiding out In his room at the dead agent 's vault . Weasel covered his tracks until now . He 's been in the warehouse the whole time . That 's how he knew about claire . - Pete , come on . - Huh ? You and me ? Alone ? Bring your favorite teddy bear and a nightlight . Come on . Jinksy , you up for a little snoop and poop , huh ? Six eyes are better than four , aren 't they , artie ? Artie . Artie . - Uh , whatever ... No , come on . I 'll take off my shirt . Been working on my guns . Yeah ? How about working on your breath ? As if valda squatting in the warehouse wasn 't creepy enough , Now we got to rummage through his stuff ? well , clearly he 's been busy in here . - Yeah , but doing what ? Well , maybe these artifacts will tell us . We just have to figure out what they do . Yeah , I 'll grab a laptop so we can check the database . - I can do it ! No , it 's okay . I got it . No , no , no ! Really ? Really ? 'cause I-I don 't mind . Yeah . Thanks , though . - So here we are ... Just us . Hi . - What are you doing ? - Huh ? - Get back to work ! - What ? Yes . All right . - Look , I 'm taking inventory Of valda 's personal effects , all right ? I don 't know , look through the files or something . - Sounds like a date . A plan . It sounds like a plan . Because a date , that would be ... that would mean ... You have got to stop eating sugar . How ... How can you be ... No . - Hey , mykes . - Yeah ? - Valda seems pretty interested In claire 's freaky psychokinetic powers . The alternate valda , he got his jollies Out of copying artifacts , right ? He replicated the ... the spine of saracen . Exactly . He made a bunch of zombie warriors . Now what if he was gonna do the same thing with claire ? What if he was gonna use her to create an army of telekinetic Rage monsters to conquer the world ? - Probably not . Yeah , but then why does he have all her medical records ? I don 't know , but there 's one item Missing from his personal effects . It 's a safe deposit key . - So ? To a box in the regent 's vault . What artifact does valda want from here ? - I have no idea . Let 's hope he hasn 't got his hands on it yet . I 'm guessing keeler not answering his phone Is a bad sign . - Oh , no . Keeler . But there 's something ... What ? Get out ! It 's a trap ! - Artie . - Artie ? - Looks like an artie-cicle . Mykes , we 're gonna have to neutralize this statue . - Yeah . Do it . Okay . Oh ! How are we gonna get through the ice ? This inuksuk probably belonged to sir william parry . - Gonna need more than that . Well , basically , it means that Artie has been cryogenically frozen . - And that means what ? - Well , we have about an hour To thaw him out before he freezes to death . I knew there was some bad news in there somewhere . - Okay , so what if we try To internally elevate his body temperature ? You remember those ... the glasses that artie used to warm up The guy that got zombified by the donner party jar ? - Yes ! Alfred butz , the inventor of the thermostat ! Let 's call steve . - Let 's call him . - Whoo . - Let 's call him out there . - Okay . Okay , I 'll take the glasses to pete and myka . Are you okay here on your own ? - Of course . I 'm following artie 's sage advice ... Channeling my anger . I don 't think that 's what he meant , But if it makes you feel better ... - Oh , it does , very much so . Go . Save artie . You keep giving me reasons to kick your ass , mister " v. " - Earplugs . Right on time . Please put in those earplugs I gave your driver . Place the needle . Place the needle . 30 minutes . These people will suffer seizures . Then their internal organs will begin to shut down . Ultimately , they 'll die . Imagine the havoc you could wreak Upon an air traffic control tower , new york stock exchange , Or a military installation . With weapons such as these , You can defeat your enemies completely undetected . This is but one artifact among tens of thousands , Artifacts that could and should be engineered as weapons , tools , Building blocks for the advancement of your empire . Today they 're locked away , useless . But with forward-thinking people like you and I in charge , We can take these objects And change the course of human destiny . Have I piqued your interest ? Place this mason 's square in the location that we 've chosen , And we can begin . Come along now , claire . We have one more important stop to make . - Hey , look at that . - He 's starting to warm up . Now this is that walking stick that causes earthquakes , right ? Sorry , it 's all we could find on such short notice . No , no , no , no , no . I think this could work . I mean , the quake might shake the ice off the statue Long enough to bag it . - Do it . - Pete smash . I hated that . Good . He 's grumpy . He 'll be okay . - Ugh , what the hell was that ? oh , I got a ... I got a ping . It 's a ping . - I 'm gonna ... I got it . - There you go . - Here we go . - This is my ping . No , it 's okay . I got it . Oh , my god . Bunch of people just fell into spontaneous comas At a park in rapid city . So we know what valda 's doing with sacks 's record player . You know , without pilates 's resistance bands to keep Their circulation flowing , all those people could die . - No , with that many victims , There wouldn 't even be enough to go around . Okay . You know what , steve ? Why don 't you stay here and keep an eye on artie , And , pete , you come with me ? - Huh ? - Okay . Or ... or ... or you guys could go deal with that And I stay with artie . Huh ? - Lattimer ! - Huh ? - Pete . - What ? That 's the third time today you 've tried to avoid myka . Why would I avoid myka ? I 'm so not avoiding myka . - You 're lying . - You know what , steve ? That old lying bit got old six minutes after you got here . Mykes , look . Pete , some of them are starting to have seizures . Yeah , the record player must 've gotten to the emts And police as soon as they came within earshot . You got those earplugs ? - Ready ? - Yeah . - Ew . The hell ? Why does he have this ? Oh , valda , you sick freakazoid . I 'm just gonna keep them inside the truck . Okay , I 'll stop the record player . - Okay ! Wait ! Secret service . Stay inside . Don 't get out . - Fudge . - Pete ! Pete ? - Mommy ? Hey ! I would 've called , but I figured ... Yeah , what the hell just happened ? - Mommy ... - " chuck yeager 's favorite Ip . " He 's the guy who broke the sound barrier . Oh , my god ! Valda switched the records ! Hey ! Hey , it 's the iron shadow 's underwear ! Charles atlas 's workout trunks . - This looks like a job for ... Dizzy , sleepy . - All right , put me in , coach ! - No , no ! I got this . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . Oh , right . You 've been there , done that . - Myka . Myka ! Mykes ! Are you okay ? Thanks , partner . - Uh ... - Ow ! - Sorry . - What are you listening for ? - Shh , shh ! Vibrations . Every artifact resonates with a unique frequency . If I come upon a silent box ... No ! No , no , no . Empty ! - What ... what did valda take ? - It 's not what he took . It 's what he 's gonna do with it . Benedict valda is gonna steal the warehouse . What do you mean valda 's gonna steal the warehouse ? With , among other things , the setting maul of hiram abiff . The getty mall at high cliff ? What ? Setting maul . It 's kind of like a mason 's hammer . - Hiram abiff . He was an architect who , according to the freemasons , Built solomon 's first temple . And his hammer is integral to the relocation of the warehouse From one host country to the next . - So how do we stop valda If he has everything he needs to steal it ? - He does not have everything . The setting maul is only one of three artifacts That precipitate the moving of the warehouse . The others are the mason 's square and the compass . He 's already stolen the square . - So he 's probably already Chosen the location of the new warehouse . Now , the placement of the square Tells the compass where to transport the artifacts . - How does the compass work ? Once the setting maul has been reassembled , It activates the compass and the compass sweeps the warehouse . It converts all the artifacts ' energy , Directs all that energy to the new warehouse . And that 's what completes the transfer . - Say what ? It 's like the transporter from star trek Minus the dilithium crystals . - Oh . Cool . Now for safety , the maul is separated Into two parts , the handle and the hammer . The hammer is located at the birthplace of the host country . See ? I 'm not just a pretty face . - So yes . Now when it 's time for the warehouse to move , Then the two pieces of the maul are reunited ... - And the compass is triggered , Which begins to phase out the artifacts . To complete the transfer , the setting maul has to be Struck against the cornerstone of the new warehouse , Phasing in the artifacts at that location . And we have to stop valda from doing that . So valda already has the handle part , So we just need to get to the hammer before he does . Well , I get that . Let 's just do that . The hammer is hidden at the green dragon tavern in boston . That 's where the boston tea party was conceived And the american revolution was born . You three , get to boston right now . Steve and I are gonna lock down the compass To keep it from being activated . Go ! Why do they call it the " aisle of the widow 's son " ? Originally , it 's a freemason ... Don 't you have access to wikipedia ? Look it up . Look out for the rat . - Ooh ! - All right . We keep the compass in here , In the widow 's son 's aisle , Because this is one of the most secure And safe areas in all of the warehouse . - So when you say " safe " ... - don 't start with me ! Valda . He must 've already moved it in position . - So let 's go get it . Well , why didn 't I think of that ? The only thing is , I don 't know where the position is , do you ? As you may have noticed , this warehouse is rather large ! - No valda . - No claire . So how the hell did we beat him here ? - Well , this bar was built over The original green dragon tavern , Which was demolished in 1854 . So I 'm guessing valda might be at the new one . Good thing he doesn 't have a myka . Yeah , but why steal the warehouse ? Why not just take it over ? Maybe he wanted to recreate it , make it more like The version he knew under paracelsus . - That 's a sobering thought . You know what I still don 't get ? I mean , was it supposed to be some sort of distraction ? - Yeah , or a demonstration . - Hmm . - Oh , snap . It 's an open house for the new owners . - Guys , over here . - She 's a regent . - He 's been here . - Or he 's still here . What we need is behind that wall . - What the hell was that ? Sounds like it 's coming from below us . - Claire . - Claudia , wait ! - Myka . Mykes , hold on ! Okay ? We don 't know if it 's ... Safe . - Please . I know you don 't want to hurt me . Told you . Telekinetic rage monster . Pete , wait , if claire loses consciousness Then that thing could crush claudia . The lens ! The lens is how he 's controlling her . - Put down your weapons ... Or claire will crush her like a grape . Come on , claire . Fight him . Fight back ! She 's still in there . I know you can hear me . You really think we 're gonna let you steal the warehouse ? You really think you have a choice ? Bury them . - No ! - Artie , what is happening ? He 's reassembled the setting maul and activated the compass . The warehouse is beginning to move . - I know ! Can you tell where valda put it ? It 's got to be somewhere under the warehouse . There 's an " under the warehouse " ? stay ! Not you , steve . Just put your back into it , lattimer . If I put my back any more into it , My kidneys are gonna explode . We just ... we 're just gonna have to find another way out . What if that is the only way ... Oh . - Claude ? The second valda trapped us down here , I started feeling ... Something different , something bad .. Worse than the warehouse moving ? - Yes , something else , Something about my connection to the warehouse . - Okay , look . This was once a safe house where paul revere And the sons of liberty plotted against the british , right ? So if the redcoats raided this place during a secret meeting ... - They 'd need an escape route . - Yes . All righty . All right , so paul revere , right ? One if by land ... Two if by sea ... Three if by secret passageway . Zoinks ! Velma , daphne , let 's go ! Are you sure the neutralizer will stop it ? I stopped being sure of things in 1983 . But if we don 't do something , Then everything in the warehouse will disappear within a day . - So no pressure . You do have a plan " b , " right ? Silly string ? That 's what 's gonna save the warehouse ? I once saw this particular silly string Lock up the entire gooery . Start spraying . - We did it . - Yes ! Yes ... ? What ? I hate spiders . We really need to find out where valda went . Well , one good thing about boston So he should turn up on at least one of the ... ah , I got you . Okay , according to the u.N. Database , License plates with the letters c-y Belong to the chinese consulate . - Outsourcing , huh ? This guy gets more evil by the minute . We really need to loop in artie . The limo tracks to a private airfield outside of boston , Where a delegation of chinese diplomats Just departed for beijing . So he is taking the warehouse to china . Man , I don 't want to work in china . It 's probably impossible to find a good burrito . I would imagine that china 's the only country With the financial power and technical wherewithal To create the kind of warehouse that valda has in mind . All right , well , let 's get to beijing and stop him . Well , how ? Valda 's already wheels-up . - Yeah , but we 've got a portal . I 'm not ready for the warehouse to move . This can 't be the end . - This isn 't the end . We won 't let it be . Hey ! - Good . We 're almost ready . Artie , I think claire has more to do with this than we think . I 'm afraid valda has plans for her . Well , if getting the hammer was all he needed her for , He would 've killed her by now , but he hasn 't . I-I-feel he needs her for something more important . - I think I know what it is . What ? That 's a bad tone . What ? The warehouse will recognize a caretaker . First caretaker of warehouse 13 was killed in the fire of 1898 . After that , her sister took over . - Mrs. Frederic ? - Had a sister ? So what , the mrs . Frederic of the east ? And that 's why valda was going through And that explains the bad juju I 've been feeling . Valda is going to make claire caretaker of his new warehouse . A very powerful one that he has control over . I wonder if a mini tesla grenade Will fit in valda 's mouth . - Claudia . Be careful . He is gonna continue to use claire against you , And he has total control of her . Not total . I saw her fight him in boston . Don 't let your feelings for her be your blind spot . Valda 's hooks may already be in her too deep . I saw it too , artie . She 's not his , not yet . - Just got to find a way in . - Yeah . Well ... Find it fast . All right , listen up . If my contact in china is right , Then valda is heading for The beijing national olympic stadium . - That 's his location ? - If he finds the cornerstone And strikes it with the setting maul , The artifacts will start to phase into their new home , And warehouse 13 will officially come to an end . - Okay . All right . Let 's go to china and stop valda from ordering takeout . Well , looks like the silly string 's a bust . Tell me that you have a plan " c . " - We have no choice . We 're gonna have to destroy the compass . What happens if we destroy it ? Happily accepting guesses on that . - The stadium 's too small . Where 's he gonna put everything ? According to these schematics , there are dozens Of underground levels , each of them several acres wide . It 's also where we 'll find the cornerstone . - Guys . That says " warehouse 14 . " - Whoa . - Everything 's still in flux . Valda hasn 't completed the transfer yet . - I told you . Now we need to set a trap for that psycho son of a ... - Welcome to cangku shisi . Warehouse 14 . My warehouse . Thank you for providing the means to come to this reality . You 've given me something in this world I could never have had in mine ... Complete control . Kill them slowly . I want them to see it all arrive before they die . These buttons are from the lab coat Worn by the chemist julius wilbrand When he discovered trinitrotoluene ... - Tnt . - As the laymen say , yes . When they 're put in close proximity to each other ... boom . Artie , if we destroy the compass , What happens when it 's actually time to move the warehouse ? Oh , let them use fedex . You ready ? Fire in the hole ! Artie , tell me that you have a plan " d . " No ! There 's no plan " d . " Valda , you son of a bitch ! This is my home ! And I will never , never let you take it away , you hear me ? Never ! Never ! Is this rope an artifact ? What 's the provenance ? - No ! It 's just a rope ! Stop asking questions and help me ! Guys , we got to get down from here Before valda finds that cornerstone . Claude , just try ... try and reach claire . Claire ... Claire , listen to me . Valda can 't control you , you hear me ? He can 't . You 're way too strong . Fight him ! it 's just making her angrier . - What am I supposed to say ? - Connect with her , claude . Find something that you ... you both love . - Claire ... Try to hear me , please . Â¶ blood and blisters Â¶ on my fingers Â¶ chaos ... You guys , this isn 't gonna work . Claudia , don 't stop . Just keep going . - Claudia , please ! Â¶ chaos rules when we 're apart Â¶ Â¶ watch my temper - Â¶ I 'll go mental - Â¶ watch my temper - Â¶ I 'll go mental Â¶ I 'll try to be gentle Both : Â¶ when I grow up Â¶ I 'll be stable Â¶ when I grow up Â¶ I 'll turn the tables - Fine . I 'll be caretaker myself . - Claire ? Claire ! Oh , I 've always loved the sound of your voice . - Oh ! - Claude ... okay , good . Myka and I are gonna try and stop valda From consecrating warehouse 14 . Meanwhile , try and get that thing off her eye . I tried , but it won 't come off . - Okay , wait , guys . If this lens gave valda access to claire 's mind , Wouldn 't reversing it give her access to his So we could transfer her artifact energy into ... - Claudia , no . I know what you 're thinking , but no . Wouldn 't transferring claire 's telekinetic rage into valda Just make him more powerful ? Yeah , you 're right . I 'm sorry . No , no . No , you know what ? Do it . I have an idea . I think we can kill two birds with one stone . Mykes , come with me . - Okay . Wish us luck . - This might hurt . - The cornerstone . So easy to change the world . - Aah ! Concentrate . Focus on valda . Send him the power . - Hey , valda ! This doesn 't belong to you . - I 'll take that . Say good-bye to your warehouse . - Hey , benny . Check your pockets . Fork you . Oh , my ... Okay , now get angry about something . - I 'm fine . - Yes ! They did it ! Yes , you guys ! - Oh , my god ! - Yes ! Whoo ! How many times do we have to save the world ? We should get a raise . - Artie , we did it ! You and me saved the warehouse ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa . You think maybe they did something in china ? Both : Nah . So are you sure I 'm really cured ? - 100 % . Yeah , the music box energy required a human host . And as soon as you sent that energy into valda And he got erased from this timeline ... - So did the energy . Simple physics , really , with a freaky warehouse twist . Yay , pete ! Okay . One more thing . what ? No ... - Yes . Oh , my ... this belongs to you now . - No , no , no . I told you . My strongest memories are of you and this guitar . So now that you 're back for good , let 's make some new ones . Besides , I 've already got my eye on this sweet '57 les paul goldtop in featherhead . of course you do . And I already booked us into the univille coffee house Sounds like you found your calling as a warehouse agent . - Yeah . I mean , at least until the whole Caretaker destiny thing kicks in . Yeah , I was destined to be in a coma For the rest of my life , and somebody changed all that . - Yeah . See , jinksy , it 's all about isolating ... Hey , guys , I got to go help artie . I 'll be right back . Oh , um , hey . You were great in china . - Pete ... okay , mr . Human lie detector . You look me in the eye and tell me I 'm lying . I am in love with myka bering . - Damn it . I know . - I just ... I can 't believe that the warehouse almost moved . We 've been here for five years , you know ? It feels ... feels like home . Try 40 years . - A little piece of advice . Take it one snag at a time . Something I 've learned on this job Is you never know when things are gonna ... Change . Artie , I thought we stopped it . - We did . There 's a problem , isn 't there ? - Yes . We retrieved the setting maul . We stopped the warehouse from moving . Why is that compass still active ? - I had a feeling ... Yes , I 'm afraid benedict valda 's actions May have set certain events into motion . Events ? What kind of events ? The kind that even I may be unable to stop .

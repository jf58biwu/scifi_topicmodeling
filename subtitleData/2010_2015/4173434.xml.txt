 DEAD SPACE : AFTERMATH ( 2011 ) Control , rescue team is in the main service corridor . Affirmative , colonel . - What 's it look like in there ? - The main power is out . - Switching to night vision . - Oh my dear God . - What the hell ? - Control , we have massive casualties over here . Confirmed . We expected that when we saw the hull damage . - Was it decompression ? - Negative on that , control . It almost looks like a wild animal tore through the crew . What the hell happened here ? - Sir , I 'm showing four live ones . - Four ? There 's supposed to be 137 crewmen . Raiders never hit a ship this big before . - We should call in reinforcements . - Cut the chatter , marines . Locate those life signs , Private . They 're in engineering . Near the shock point core . That 's it then . Lock and load , marines . Hey , look out ! - What 's happening ? - The engines are firing . How is that possible ? It 's over . They 're dead . Finally . It 's finished . It 's not finished . This is too big to end here . We 've been in contact with a higher power . God damn it ! I 've had enough of your crazy shit , Stross . You can 't see because you 're not a true vessel . Will you two shut the hell up ? ! We still need to work together , all right ? - We 've got to get ... - Quiet . Listen . Do you hear that ? Oh my God . They 've come for us . It can 't be more of them . We destroyed that damn thing . I won 't let them hurt her . This is Abraxis Rescue Team . Identify yourselves . - Thank God you 're here . - I knew they 'd come . I 'm Dr. Isabel cho , chief medical officer of the USG O 'Bannon . You just get away now . Nobody 's taking my baby away from me again . Drop the weapon now ! - Nickolas , it 's all right . - Kuttner , don 't do it . - Put ' em down . - No , please , you have no idea what we 've been through . They sent you , didn 't they ? They think that they can control this . They are all fools . Can 't you see ? It 's already happening . Convergence is here . We shall all be made whole ! Aggh ! Fools . Control , we 've got one blue casualty and four survivors in custody . Bringing ' em in . What the fuck do you think really happened over there ? The bodies had these looks on their faces like whatever killed those people drove ' em crazy first . What 's command saying ? Command 's treating the whole thing as a navigational accident . Accident my ass . It almost looked like they killed each other . If you ask me , something went seriously fubar out there and the big guys back home are trying to cover their big fat ass ... Oh , excuse us . We didn 't see you . They sent an interrogation unit all the way out here ? What kind of shit did those bastards from the O 'Bannon get into ? I don 't know , but they are righteously fucked now . Scans confirm the target has been destroyed . It 's unrecoverable . Unfortunate , but not a complete loss . - What of the survivors ? - Only four , I 'm afraid . I 'm informed our specialist is among them . Luckily , yes . We 're prepping for debriefing now , sir . I am authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques . I see . Do you think that will be necessary ? We don 't have time for subtlety . There have been questions raised about what happened at Aegis 7 . When word of the O 'Bannon gets out , people will demand answers . If you can 't provide them , I shall be forced to re-evaluate my confidence in your abilities . Of course , sir . You have seven hours before your ship docks at the Sprawl . This situation needs to be resolved by then . Yes , sir , I understand perfectly . What are you standing around for ? Have the first subject brought in . It 's time to go to work . It 's everywhere , all around us , - inside us ... the patterns . - Hey ! - Guards ! - I see it all now . - Will somebody talk to me ? - Human life is only a passing phase . I 'm not supposed to be here . Hey , is anybody out there ? God damn it , somebody open this door . It 's okay , Vivian . Don 't worry , pumpkin , we 're safe now . Everything 's gonna be just fine . Soon we 'll be back with Mommy and then we 'll all be together . This is fucking crazy . I mean , it just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . We survived that horror show back on the O 'Bannon just to be locked up here ? You know the reason we 're in here is because that fucking lunatic shot a marine . If anybody should be in here , it 's him . It 's okay , baby girl . He 's just a little scared . Don 't pay any mind . I don 't have anything to do with this crazy bastard . - I don 't even know these people . - Borges , will you calm down ? You 're not helping matters . They have deeper reasons for detaining us than Mr. Kuttner 's outburst , Mr. Borges . There 's a great design behind everything that 's happened . And we 're each a part of it now . Seriously , am I the only one who didn 't go batshit crazy back on that damn planet ? Stross is right about one thing . We might have a problem . I did a tour on one of these with a med unit a few years ago . We 're on board a government interceptor ship in a holding cell where they detain terrorists . So what does that mean ? It means the government might want someone to blame for what happened on the O 'Bannon . And that will most certainly be us , Alejandro . This may well be the last time we see each other . Don 't touch me ! Isabel , what 's the matter ? Well , it 's about fucking time . What 's going on ? - Why are you holding us here ? - Step back . Hey hey hey , take it easy . - No problem here . - Nickolas Kuttner , - you will come with us . - Huh-uh . I 'm not leaving my little girl . Don 't do that . Let me talk to him , okay ? Get your hands off me ! I 'm not letting you take me away from her . Stop . Stop it ! He 's had enough . You 'll kill him . - What the hell is going on ? - I don 't know . Let me go , God damn it . She needs me . You bastards , can 't you see her ? - In the chair , if you please . - She 's right there . No no , she needs me . I have to protect her . She needs her father . No no , Vivian , Vivian ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Mr. Kuttner , please calm yourself . We have some questions . I 'm not telling you shit until I see my daughter . Mr. Kuttner , the mind holds countless rational and irrational fears . For you , the fear is being burned alive . No ! No ! That was simply an electronically induced hallucination , created in the brain , but the mind is reality , is it not ? State your name and occupation . Nickolas Kuttner , ex-marine , security officer on the cDc O 'Bannon . What the hell do you want from me ? You are not here to ask questions , Mr. Kuttner . We are going to ask the questions . You are going to answer them honestly and completely . Do you understand ? Yeah , I understand . We want you to start from the beginning . We want you tell us about the mission to Aegis 7 . Aegis 7 . The O 'Bannon got word to ship out about a week ago . We were ordered to Titan , where we picked up a team of civilian tech heads . Mission specs were sealed so nobody knew where we were headed . After we were underway a few days , the captain called a briefing . Is that your daughter , Mr. Kuttner ? She 's beautiful . My son has the exact same color eyes . Mind your business , Stross . He doesn 't wanna talk about it , Nolan . His little girl died in an accident back home a few weeks ago . Oh God , that 's terrible . I don 't know what I 'd do if anything happened to my little boy . Dr. Cho , how 's it going , girl ? Hey , Stross , I saw your wife earlier . She seemed a little stressed . Alexis is always stressed . So , Isabel , wanna go grab a drink at the Hole after this ? They got 12-credit specials after 05 : 00 . I 'm sorry . I can 't . I 've got two rookies with artificial gravity sickness to deal with . Ugh ! Boring , Doc . You stay locked in med bay all the time , you 'll never get a man interested in you . Have some fun . Personally , I think starting any mission without a drink or six is a bad idea . I 'll grab a beer with you if the offer 's open . Oh , I don 't usually drink with tech heads , but sure , why not ? I 'm no lowly tech head , thank you very much . I 'm gravimetric control engineer , first class . So what do you guys know about this mission I don 't ? That is what we called you here to tell you , Mr. Nayim . Commander Sergenko , I didn 't realize you were on this ship . Excuse me , sir . I 'm Alejandro Borges with the engineering team from Titan Station . I understood this was just a routine gravimetric stabilization gig . What 's with all the secrecy ? This isn 't your standard asteroid patch-up job , son . This is big time . It must be . Dragging our sorry asses all the way to the edge of the galaxy ... Eyes up and mouth shut , people . Good morning , captain . Good morning . This is why we 're here . I 'm here ' cause it 's double wages . The planet is Aegis 7 . It was virtually destroyed in a mining accident three weeks ago . As you can see , the impact has made the planet unstable . - Unstable ? - Damn ! That 's where we come in . Ourjob is to hold Aegis 7 together . You 've got to be kidding ! There is no way ... The captain is not yet finished speaking . After we achieve orbit , eight drop ships will deliver gravity stabilizers to these key points . The artificial gravity web generated should be enough to stabilize the planet . Are you serious ? With only eight units ? That planet is practically one huge bomb ready to explode . How long do you think a few gravity stabilizers will hold something like that together ? This is what you signed on for , Mr. Borges . It 's too late for you to back out now . Any other questions ? When do we drop , captain ? 05 : 00 . Dismissed . Stross , cho , Kuttner , Rin , we would like to speak with you . I understand some of you have heard rumors about what happened on Aegis 7 . You can speak freely . I 've heard they found something on the planet surface so terrible a guy called clarke dropped a whole continent on it . Something ... something alien . - Bullshit . - The rumors are true . They discovered an alien artifact 65 million years old . My God ! It 's actually real ? What the hell is it ? No one knows for sure . It 's supposed to contain certain properties . What kind of properties ? That 's classified , Dr. Cho , even to me . And I assume the artifact was destroyed upon impact . Correct , but satellite imaging reveals fragments have survived . Your team 's mission is to locate and secure whatever can be salvaged of the artifact . On a planet that could explode any minute ? It will be well worth the risk , Mr. Kuttner . Let 's cut to the chase , captain . Just how much are these fragments worth ? Two million credits a kilo . You know , I hear Aegis 7 is beautiful this time of year . Shuttle 1 , prepare for launch . - We 're dropping in three . - You 're playing hologames - three minutes before a drop , Pawling ? - Yeah , I can 't pause it right now . Aren 't you a little young to be on this operation anyway ? My cousin 's a genius at two things : Hologames and gravity stabilizers . We 'd be screwed without him . The real question is , what are you guys doing here ? You 're not engineers . We 're surveying for gravity fluctuations . Fluctuations ? The whole planet 's one big goddamn fluctuation . What the hell are you surveying ? Locking onto gravity stabilizer . Releasing docking clamps . Ready to drop . Hold onto your breakfast , kiddies . Shuttle 1 , drop in five , four , three , two , drop . Entering lower atmosphere . Here 's where the ride gets fun , folks . Yee-haw ! - I always hate this part . - Crazy bastard , level us out ! Will you look at that ? God damn ! Holy shit ! This isn 't a planet . It 's a freakin ' disaster in process . This is nearly total gravimetric and geothermal disruption . It seems impossible the planet 's held together this long . Almost as if ... - As if what ? - Nothing . Nothing at all . I need more data . Okay , Noah , Omar , ourjob is to keep that stabilizer from overloading . Let these guys go do whatever the fuck it is they 're really doing here . The scanners are calibrated to the frequency of the mortar fragments . Sweep out in branching formation . Maintain radio contact at all times . Any questions ? Back here at 09 : 00 . Ho ! This is bullshit . Rin , come in . This rock is getting more unstable by the minute and I haven 't found a damn thing . Kuttner , I 've lost track of your signal . - Rin . - Come in , do you read me ? - Come in . - Rin , you copy ? Holy shit . Rin , come in . I 've got something . This way , I think . I gotta be right on top of it . Will you look at this ? Oh God ! This is ... What is it ? I don 't ... I don 't understand . Ahhhh ! # Twinkle twinkle # # Little star # - # How I wonder what you are . # - It can 't be . Papa , what are we , Papa ? What are human beings ? Vivian , no , wait ! Where did you go ? " Daddy will always keep you safe . " That 's what you said to me . No , not again ! This isn 't possible . This isn 't possible . Come in , do you read me ? Come in , Kuttner . - Rin . - Where the hell are you ? Sergenko wants us back at the ship . This place is coming apart . - Something just happened . - Kutt , do you copy ? Yeah . - Yeah , I copy . - Rin out . - Papa ? - Vivian . I miss you so much , Papa . Oh , baby , I miss you too . Why didn 't you take care of me ? I tried to take ... no ! Get away from her . Get away from her , no ! No ! Vivian . What 's happening ? Get away from me . Get away from me ! Kutt , what 's with you ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . Kuttner , all I got from you was static . What happened ? I 'm not sure . I saw ... - I saw ... - Nickolas , what 's wrong ? Are you in pain ? He 's been acting weird since I found him . It could be his suit pressure . What do you want ? Keep away from me . Take it easy , Kutt . Everything 's cool . Kuttner , what is that in your hand ? - It looks like a fragment . - Papa ! Vivian ! - They 've got me , Papa . - No ! Vivian ! - Kuttner , stand down . - Leave me alone . They 've got my daughter and I 'm gonna save her . - Vivian ! - Someone stop him . - Kutt , where are you going ? - Vivian ! He 's got a piece of the artifact . It 's affecting his mind . Get after him . Kuttner , what are you doing here ? You 're gonna have to wait , man . We got a problem with the power flow . - Papa ! - Vivian ? Papa , help me . Keep away from my daughter . What 's he doing ? He 's gone nuts ! - What the hell is your problem , man ? - I won 't let them hurt you , Vivian . I won 't let you have her . Leave her alone ! Get away from my ... Papa ! Papa ! Help me , Papa ! Leave her alone ! My head . What happened ? Viv , where are you , honey ? Noah , no ! Shh ! Don 't speak . You 'll be okay . I need help here ! Borges , Pawling . What happened ? - Did the monsters get him ? - You bastard ! Oh , Nick . What have you done ? Rin , Stross , lock Kuttner in the ship now . The stabilizer 's overloading . Noah , can you hear me ? Noah ! - Let me see him . - Noah ! Alejandro , you have to let me see him . Make sure those bonds are secure . The artifact 's influence can cause homicidal outbursts . And how do you know that , huh ? What 's really going on here ? Rin , Rin , where 's Vivian ? We can 't leave without my daughter . What the hell happened to him out there ? Papa . Goodbye , Papa . Vivian ! Vivian ! No ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go . No ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go . She needs me . Let me go ! There you are . There you are , baby girl . - Prep the subject for cryosleep . - Wait . Yes sir . Mr. Kuttner will be of great use to us . Guards , restrain the subject . Hold it right there ! What do you think you 're doing ? Don 't hurt me , please . I was ordered to do it . You won 't take me away from her . She needs her father . I have to find her . I have to keep her safe . Hurry , you fool . Alert security . Tell them he must not be harmed . Vivian ! Where are you , Vivian ? It 's Daddy , baby . Don 't be afraid . Vivian . Wait . Don 't go , Vivian . Come back . Daddy 's hurt , baby girl . Just please . Please wait for me . Where did you go ? - Papa . - Viv . No ! Don 't ... don 't leave me . Don 't leave me again . Papa , get up . You have to get up , Papa . - Vivian . - I 'm here , Daddy . Pumpkin . You have to hurry , Papa . They 're coming . They wanna take you away from me . I 'm here , Daddy . Come to me . We can be together . Together . Always . Always and forever , Papa . Always and forever . - There he is . - What 's he doing ? - He 's opening the airlock ! - He 's gone crazy . Stop him ! No ! # Twinkle twinkle # # Little star # # How I wonder what you are # # Up above the world so high # - # Like a diamond in the sky . # - Always and forever . He came into direct contact with a shard . The Overseer will not be pleased . But we still have the others . Bring in Alejandro Borges . Humanity is just the beginning , the chrysalis for something greater , something older , wiser . We will become . We must become . Stross , I 'm serious , man . I will pay you real money to just shut the fuck up . What do you think those alarms were all about ? Oh , uh , Kuttner 's dead . Stop it . You don 't know that . But I do . I can sense it . We are all one . This separate limited existence of living matter is just an illusion , a passing dream . Great . Thanks for creeping me out yet again , Doc . Are you ready to cooperate , Mr. Borges ? Okay , all right , anything . Just no more spiders . Tell us about the disaster on Aegis 7 . Tell us about the shard . I ... didn 't even know about the damn shard . I was just there to do a job . Okay , Noah , Omar , ourjob is to keep that stabilizer from overloading . Let these guys go do whatever the fuck it is they 're really doing here . Something 's up with their little expedition . Suspicious as hell . What do you mean ? They 're here to measure gravity fluctuations ? I don 't buy it for a second . The planet 's breaking up . Move your asses . We got work to do . Looks like I 'm gonna have an interesting first day on the job . I knew six stabilizers couldn 't hold it . We 've got to hold her . There are still teams on the ground . The power flow 's out of balance . Gravity fluctuating . Go to manual . Noah , do you have it ? - Just a second . Almost there . - Noah ! - Got it ! Yes ! - Good work , kid . I 'm impressed . - That 's my coz . - Whoa ! Whoa there ! Shh . Settle down , big boy . That 's it . Sliced , diced , dead . God , come on , there 's gotta be a harder setting than impossible . Eh , the movie was better . Hey , I never asked you , Borges , how did you end up with that arm ? Not much to tell , really . Mining accident . I lost it when a grav stabilizer I was working blew . My coz is being humble again , Nayim . Alejandro there saved five guys off that rig . He 's a hero . We lost 15 men that day . I 'm no hero . I 'm sorry . Life takes us strange places . I was going to be a priest when I was young . You 're a Unitologist , Omar ? You really believe aliens - created the human race ? - Look at us . We have perfect symmetry and a brain as powerful as the most advanced computer . And this came out of nothing ? Bullshit . Laugh if you wish , my friend , but human life was created by alien beings . And when we die , we return to them . - Grav flux is starting up again . - We 've got an overload . Gravity web is destabilizing . She won 't hold . We could drop a dozen stabilizers on this planet and it still wouldn 't keep what 's left from blowing . We need to hold it until the teams get back . Noah , can you balance the flow ? Kuttner , what are you doing here ? - What 's he doing ? - I won 't let you ! Omar . - Wait wait . - What the hell is your problem , man ? - We don 't have time for this shit . - I won 't let them hurt you , Vivian . - Run , baby , run ! - Who 's Vivian ? What the hell are you talking about ? Monster ! Get away from her ! - Almost got it . There ! - Noah . Yes , we 're stable . I 'll kill you . I 'll kill you all . No ! Noah ! Oh my God . Oh my God . Noah . - Stabilize . - Don 't speak . You 'll be okay . I need help here ! What happened ? Did the monsters get him ? You bastard ! - Let me see him . - Noah , can you hear me ? Noah ! Alejandro , you have to let me see him . He 's bleeding out . We have to get him back to the ship . Doc , is he gonna be okay ? I 'm so sorry . The stabilizer is overloading . I can 't hold it . Alejandro , Alejandro , they need you . The whole power grid is failing . Alejandro , I 'm sorry , my friend . Automatic systems are a total loss . It 's a cascade failure . There 's nothing we can do . - We have to get out of here . - This is Sergenko . All units evacuate . Get back to the shuttles , everyone . Move ! Go go , move it ! Run , get to the ship now ! The lava is flowing this way . That 's Nolan and Rin up ahead . There 's a chasm ahead . Don 't stop . Jump it , come on ! Jump ! - This way . - I can 't run anymore . Gotcha ! Thank you . Rin . Rin ! Rin ! Nolan . - I 'm okay . - Don 't stop . Get to the ship . Rin , I 'm sorry . You were a good soldier . - Oh my God . - Go around , hurry ! - Commander Sergenko . - Too late . Borges , take this . It 's more important than you know . Protect it . Get out of here , all of you . That 's an order . Get on the ship . Sergenko ! - What is happening ? - Gravity increasing . - Is everyone all right ? - Omar ! Omar , above you . Look out ! - Omar ! Omar ! - Borges , we can 't help him . - We have to go . - We must get to the ship . What the fuck is happening ? - Get me out of this . - Shut the fuck up , you crazy motherfucker ! Buckle up , guys . We have to get off the planet . Someone cut me loose , God damn it . Hold on . The planet 's going . Why is the engineer flying the goddamn ship ? - Borges ! - I 'm barely a pilot , okay ? - I think I 'm gonna throw up . - Aim for Kuttner . Shit ! We 've lost Shuttle 4 . We must get the shard back to the O 'Bannon . What are they doing ? The ship is too close to the planet . They need to clear the gravity well before they shock point out . That bastard 's not leaving us behind . Hold on ! Borges , we have to go faster . It 's tearing apart now . The engines ... look out for the engines . Hold on ! - Borges ! - This is bullshit . We 're coming in too fast . I told you we shouldn 't have let him drive . Shit shit shit ! Get those fires out now , move it ! Come on ! Come on ! Are you all right ? Someone call medical . That son of a bitch ! Full power to the engines . No contact with survey teams . Are we far enough to shock point ? - You ! You knew ! - Hold on , son . - We 've got a situation here . - She 's going . Emergency power to shock point drive . - Shocking out , in eight ... - Collision alert . Seven , six , five ... four , three ... - We 're not gonna make it . - Two ... Look out ! Emergency thrusters . Fly with the blast . Ride it , ride it , God damn it ! Firing thrusters . Damage report . Damage report ! Hull breach in section B. Shock point drive is down . We have heavy casualties in engineering , sir . Weapons control , vaporize any planetary debris that gets too close . Lieutenant Marcus , send out a distress signal . Sir , those rocks will tear us to pieces . We won 't survive very long without the shock point drive . I understand the situation , Ensign Voigt . Borges , get your team down to the engine room and repair that drive . Mr. Borges , I gave you an order . I 'm not fixing shit until you explain why this fucking rock was worth my cousin 's life , sir . What are you talking about ? Captain , Kuttner had some sort of psychotic breakdown . Engineer Pawling was killed , as were most of the engineering teams . Follow me , all of you . First Officer , I want a full damage report in five minutes . Yes sir . Okay , ladies , man your stations . The bodies have been taken to cold storage . Kuttner is under observation in sick bay . Captain , perhaps it would be best to keep the shard under quarantine until we know more about its properties . Mmm , of course . I was hoping for more , but ... You were hoping for more ? You sent us on a suicide mission for a lump of rock ? This is much more than just a lump of rock , son . The high I.Q. Boys back home say this will change the face of science itself ... And that 's worth all the people who died back there ? Easy , Alejandro . I 'm sure the captain couldn 't predict the shard 's influence on Kuttner . Look , son , the shard ... it 's worth a lot of money . Enough for you to take care of Engineer Pawling 's family for the rest of their lives . You son of a bitch ! - Borges ! - Take it easy , Alejandro . What the fuck was that ? Pieces of the planet are still impacting the ship . We need to get clear of the debris field . Mr. Borges , if I didn 't need you to save the ship , you would be in the brig for that . Now get your ass down to the engine room and repair the shock point drive , or we 're all dead ! Alejandro ? How old was Pawling ? About 19 . I 'm sorry , Noah , I got you this job . It 's all my fault . And you never came into direct contact with the fragment ? No , I swear . I never touched the damn thing . Lie detection states 99.9 % truth . He never touched it . Thank you , Mr. Borges . You 've been most cooperative . What 's happening ? We 'll have you escorted to guest quarters for the remainder of your trip to the Sprawl . You mean I can go ? Seriously ? You 'll have to go through med scans of course , but you 'll be back home to your family as soon as we dock . Oh , thank God . Thank you . Thank you . - Right this way , Mr. Borges . - I can 't believe it . I 'm actually going home . I gotta tell you guys , a couple times back on the O 'Bannon , I honestly thought I was a dead man . Have them remains taken to cold storage - and bring in Nolan Stross . - Yes sir . No no , what are you doing ? Please don 't . Don 't do this ! No ! Stop ! Let me out ! No ! I 'll be good . Let me out . Oh God , please let me out ! Claustrophobia . Most horrible . Now I take it you 're ready to talk sense . We 're on a bit of a deadline . I 'm sure you understand . Yes yes , I understand ... better than you could possibly comprehend . Dr. Stross , you have been chief research scientist on the O 'Bannon for a little over a year now . One year , two months and nine days . And all that while you 've also been clandestinely a part of our government 's secret investigation into the alien marker . Is that correct ? That 's correct . Since I was already a part of the O 'Bannon 's crew , they decided to send us in after the Ishimura incident . I was to examine any fragments in the marker and make a thorough report . I see . Now why don 't you share with me the results of your investigation ? After we returned to the O 'Bannon , I went to check on my family . My family means a great deal to me . The shock point drive is down ? But how are we gonna get home without it ? An engineering team is working around the clock to fix it , Alexis . Don 't worry . Everything 's gonna be fine . - Won 't it , little fella ? - Nolan , level with me . Does all this have anything to do with that other research you 're doing ? - The government stuff ? - Alexis , can you please not grill me during the few moments a day I get with my son ? I need to go . The captain wants me to examine the artifact - we found on the planet . - What kind of artifact ? - The classified kind . - What about that doctor you 're always with ? Is she classified too ? Alexis . You spend more time with her than with us . She 's a colleague . Why would I have brought you on this trip if there was anything going on ? Because you 're the senior science officer and I pestered to come along . - I 've gotta get to the lab . - You can 't keep running there every time I wanna have a discussion about our relationship . Don 't wait up . Oh , sweetie . I 'm here . Mommy 's here . Come in . Caleb , I really should be starting the analysis of the shard . Captain ? I want some answers , Mr. Stross . I nearly lost my ship recovering that damn thing . I know I 'm just supposed to turn it over to you . You 'll have to take that up with home base . I have . They tell me all matters connected with the shard are need-to-know only . My goddamn ship 's scientist needs to know more about this mission than I do apparently . Excuse me for saying so , sir , but you don 't look well . It 's the shard . I can hear it talking to me . Caleb , have you discussed this with Dr. Cho ? Just get the damn thing out of my sight , but I 'm warning you , Stross , whatever the hell is going on , you keep it in your lab . We 're in deep enough shit here as it is . It 's even more astonishing than I could have possibly imagined . What is , Doctor ? The structure is similar to a hologram . Every particle contains all the information of the whole . What made this cuneiform-like symbol ? There 's no scratching or sign of cutting ... as if the crystal itself gave birth to it . What ? What 's happening ? The shard , it 's ... Oh , my head . Some form of telepathic encoding ? Dr. Stross , are you feeling well ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . My God , it 's a form of DNA , a blueprint . Nolan , what are you doing ? Isabel , you won 't believe it . Sandra , that will be all . - Thank you . - But , Doctor , we need to run - a spectral analysis ... - That will be all , Miss Burns . Isabel , it 's amazing . The shard , it 's the key to an alien language , a guide to DNA chains I 've never seen before . This may contain the secret to the future of human evolution . Nolan , are you okay ? You seem a little hyperactive . Try and understand , this is the finding of a lifetime . Well , don 't let it go to your head , hmm ? But this could alter the very destiny of humanity , - change everything . - Shh ! We 'll talk about that later . But right now ... The shard seems to generate some sort of carrier wave so advanced my instruments can barely detect it . Though I have a theory that when it comes into contact with dead human tissue , it reanimates the cells , possibly into a new and more evolved form . Can you explain what happened to Kuttner on the planet ? Well , it seems most humans when influenced by the marker become hyperpsychotic . Only a very small percent are resilient to its effects . Kuttner was already on the edge ... his grief over his daughter . The shard pushed him over into a delusional state . And you believe the shard was originally created by aliens ? A higher intelligence most definitely , what a primitive mind would call God . God , he says . Stross , maybe you should get some sleep . Stross , Stross ? Can you hear me ? The shard somehow transmits nightmares , dreams and visions , but the knowledge , it emanates . I need a test subject . Already the signal from the shard permeates the dead flesh of the subject . I 've never seen anything transform an entire host cell so quickly . It 's ... it 's beautiful . Damn it ! How can I be expected to complete my experiments under these conditions ? What ? That 's not possible . Oh no ! It 's all your fault , Doctor . They will all suffer because of you . H-hallucination . It was just a hallucination . The door ... I broke the seal . I wasn 't thinking . Good Lord , what have I done ? - Dr. Stross , I 've got the analysis ... - Sandra , get out ! Oh no . No , get away . It 's not my fault . The shard ... it tricked me . Leave me alone ! Hold the light steady , will ya ? It 's still after me . Here , it won 't find me in here . No ! Oh my God , no ! Oh God . Oh God . Oh God , I need help . The captain . The captain . Captain , I have to tell you . It 's about the shard . Not right now , Stross . I 've got the engine room on the horn . I need that shock point back online now , Borges . Thanks to that class-A clusterfuck down on the planet , captain , I barely have any engineers left . It 'll be a miracle if we can pull this thing off . Mister , I have taken all the shit ... - What the hell is going on ? - We 're under attack . Borges . Borges ! God damn it . Lieutenant Marcus , take a security team down there . - Captain , please , listen to me . - Not now , Stross ! We have a code 3 emergency in the engine room . All personnel report to their stations . This is not a drill . Repeat , this is not a drill . Alexis , the baby . Emergency stations , move it . Move it ! Oh oh God . Alexis . Lex , are you here ? Alexis , I made a horrible mistake . The shard . I 'm not thinking clearly . Alexis ? Son , son , is that you ? Get off of me ! - Where 's my son ? - Nolan ! That 's my baby ! No ! You monster ! Get away from my family . Nolan . Nolan ? Nolan , something 's happening . The bodies ... they 're turning into creatures . It has to be the shard . Oh God . Oh my God . Seeing those dead creatures must have truly affected her . Isabel changed after that , but I had to do it . Those things were threatening my family . Dr. Stross , where is your family now ? I ... I locked them in their quarters . Did your men find them ? Are they safe ? What about the baby ? - His heart rate is 160 . - I need to see them . Convergence is coming . We have to be together - when the change arrives . - Dr. Stross , where is your family ? In my quarters , I told you . Yes , you did . Where is your family ? Safe in quarters . Saved them ... I saved them . Interesting . I 've never seen such a complete block before . Increase the voltage . I won 't ! I won 't remember . - You can 't make me remember . - Really quite extraordinary . You 're just doing what it wants you to do , all of you . You 're gonna kill me now , aren 't you ? Like you did Kuttner and Borges . We don 't want to kill you , Dr. Stross . - You don 't ? - Of course not . You came into direct contact with the marker . It actually communicated with you . Your mind holds the key to its language . You 're exactly what we 've been looking for . What is that ? What are you doing ? Please stop . I did everything I was asked to do . Why are you doing this to me ? Stop . Stop it . Please stop . Not this , please . Please please ! Unfortunate ... about the claustrophobia . They will be pleased , won 't they , sir ? Stross is everything they wanted . Not quite everything . Bring in Isabel cho . Sprawl , this is Abraxis . - Requesting permission to dock . - Permission granted , Abraxis . Welcome home . You are making this unnecessarily difficult , Doctor . We merely wish to know about the shard 's full effects upon the O 'Bannon 's crew . You 're talking to the wrong person . Nolan studied the artifact . And we want to know more about Nolan Stross . Did he reveal the details of his investigation to you ? - You were having an affair . - Why is that relevant ? Dr. Cho , I have no wish to cause you further discomfort , but if you do not answer my question , I shall be forced to intensify my methods . Do you understand me ? Yes . Tell me about your affair with Dr. Stross . I ... the affair lasted several months . We 'd been working together for a year . I didn 't plan it . It was just something that happened . He told me he was going to leave his wife , but I didn 't want him to . I tried to stay away , but I couldn 't . For the first time in my life I was in love . After we found the shard on Aegis 7 , Nolan started acting strange , erratic . Do you know what 's the most fascinating thing - about the crystal structure , Isabel ? - Hmm ? The patterns there are almost familiar , like a dream I 've nearly forgotten . I think you 've lost me . I only speak English and Korean . This is going to shape reality itself , Isabel . Nolan , I want you to come to sick bay . Let me run some psych scans . Remember what that thing did to Kuttner ? I don 't need psych scans . You have no comprehension of what I 'm doing here . I 've nearly grasped its sacred language ... the ultimate source of human life itself . Nolan , you 're starting to scare me . I think it 's time for you to leave . I have work to do . All right . I need to check on Kuttner anyway . So how 's our patient today ? Resting comfortably , Doctor . Are you feeling better , Nickolas ? Head hurts , still can 't remember much . Do you remember seeing your daughter ? Of course . She 's out playing right now . - She 'll be back soon . - Of course she will . Those engineers better get the drive working . I need to get Vivian home to her mother . I 'm sure they 're doing their best . I have to go . Try and get some rest , okay ? Whenever I close my eyes , all I see are monsters . All right , Doctors . We have a dozen DOAs to process . Ripley and Wells should have finished the prep by now . The captain wants a full report by ... oh my God . - Good Lord . - The bodies are gone . What could have done this ? By the Great Marker . Is that Dr. Ripley ? Call the captain . We 've got to ... Get out ! Get out ! Shut the door ! Run ! Get out of there ! - Shut the door ! - Is that door gonna hold ? - Did everyone get out ? - What is it ? Emergency stations . Everyone get to your posts now ! Move it ! - Doc , what 's going on ? - My God , this can 't be happening . - Doc ! - It can 't be . Am I going crazy ? What the fuck is that ? - Oh no . - Get me out of here . Get me off off this table now . It 's the monsters , isn 't it ? I knew they 'd be back . Come on ! Come on , you bastard . Here I am , right here . What the hell is it ? The shard 's behind this . I can feel it . - Where 's the rest of the crew ? - I don 't know . - We have to find Vivian . - I 'm sure she 's safe . Look , if the shard 's doing this , then we need to find Nolan . Come on . All this blood ... what happened to all the bodies ? They changed . They became one . I saw it . I saw it happen . Chief , is that you ? They want you too . They want you both dead ! - Oh shit ! - Chief , what are you doing ? Let 's go . This way . Right behind you . - Where are we now ? - This is Nolan ... I mean , Dr. Stross ' quarters . Wait here . - Keep your eyes open . - No shit . You think ? Nolan ? Nolan , something 's happening . The bodies , they 're turning into creatures . Nolan , is that your wife ? The baby . Nolan , what have you done ? Isabel , we have to warn the others . - I accidentally released the infection . - Keep away from me . Keep away from me ! - You monster ! - Doc ? - Isabel . - You monster ! What is it ? What 's the matter with you ? Look out . There 's another one . - How many of these things are there ? - On your left . - Aim for its eyes . - It 's still coming ! - Get out of the halls . - Get to safety . Look out ! - It 's still coming ! - Stross , what the hell is going on ? - What are these things ? - They are the future , captain . They 're what we were always meant to become , - glorious and immortal . - God damn it , Nolan . Get it together . What 's wrong with you , man ? Captain , we 've got more company . Too many to fight . We need a way out . Vivian . Baby , is that you ? Vivian , wait . - Come back . It 's not safe down there . - Kuttner . - Where the hell 's he going ? - No , he 's right . - They can 't follow us through there . - Then hurry . Move your ass . - He went into the vent . - Get moving ! - I 'll cover you . - Keep going all of you . - Hustle it up , Pallas . - Right behind you , captain . No ! Let go , you son of a bitch . - Ow ! - Officer Pallas . Caleb , get them out of here ! - Officer Pallas . Leslie . Leslie ! - There 's nothing you can do . She 's gone . She 's gone ! She ... she was a good officer , a good shipmate . We need to keep going , captain . Those things may find a way into the vent . Come on , Vivian went this way . By all means , let 's follow the ghost of his dead daughter . I 'm not entirely comfortable depending on someone who has obviously lost his mind . Yeah , I know exactly what you mean . Vivian says we should go down there . I think we 're over the science section . This is your lab , right , Stross ? Sounds quiet enough . It 's all clear . - Come on . - Something 's got him . No ! Borges , it 's us . - It 's Kuttner . - I know who it is . Take you with me . Stop it . Stop it ! We don 't have time for this shite ! Calm down , Alejandro . I only want safety for my daughter . Your daughter 's dead , asshole . Just like my cousin you killed . No , Vivian , don 't listen . He 's confused . He 's just scared . Borges , what 's the situation with the shock point drive ? Did you get it operational ? Fuck no . The engine room is totally fucked ! We barely got out . - We ? - Sorry , captain . We were overrun . They got the bridge as well . Let me take a look at that arm . Pretty rough laceration , but you 'll be okay . - I 'll need some help here . - I 'll help , love . Isabel , what is wrong with you ? Keep away from me , you sick bastard , or I swear I 'll throw you out there with the rest of the monsters . Stross , we could use you over here . - Yes , captain . - What the hell is going on ? Why is my crew turning into goddamn monsters ? Homo sapiens are the true monster . These are higher forms of life . We 're becoming them , and soon we will all become one . - What did you say ? - Ignore him . He 's not well . No no , there 's an old Unitologist proverb : All forms of life will unite in convergence and we shall be one . My mom said that we were living in the end of days . Convergence is coming soon . By the look of things , it seems like your mom was right . So how the hell do we stop it ? Stross , you 're the only one who understands those things . How can we stop them ? Nolan , look , we need you , okay ? The necromorphs are animated by the signal from the shard . We have to stop the carrier wave . Then give me that goddamn thing . I 'll stop it . Didn 't even scratch it . There 's no way you can destroy it , only shatter it . And every piece will retain the properties of the original , like a hologram . There 's got to be a way . No no . It was designed by an intelligence we can 't begin to comprehend . You would have to cast it into the heart of a star . Or a reactor core ? Yes . Yes , that might do it . Then we take this thing to the engine room and we destroy it . Are you serious ? The engine room is fucking crawling - with those things . - Then we fight our way through them . We don 't have a lot of choice . The ship can 't take much more . What do we have for weapons ? Just your gun and these bone saws we grabbed in medical . I was working on those things until you guys showed up . Are you actually building something out of all this junk ? Flamethrower , a few incendiary grenades . Found some plasma cutters ... charges are pretty low . Okay then . Can you travel , Lieutenant Marcus ? - Yes sir . - Then everybody arm yourselves . Let 's go . God damn , it 's quiet . Those things couldn 't have gotten the whole crew , could they ? - Everybody stay together . - Wait . What was that ? I thought I heard something . It 's clear . This way . I know I heard something . - Look out ! - Marcus , get out of here ! Aw shit ! Move it . It 's right behind you . - I think we 're just pissing it off . - Got any better ideas ? - Yeah , run ! - This way ! Hurry ! Down here . - Jenny ? - Lana , don 't get too close to it . It 's all right . It 's my roommate Jenny . Praise the Marker . Jenny , are you okay ? Lana , no . Get away from it . Lana ! - They 're right behind us . - Come on , Doc , we gotta go . Let 's see if this bad boy works . Finally . The engine room 's through that door . We 're not too far from the reactor core . We 're not there yet . Look ! Let 's go ! Move it ! We 've got a hull breach ! Hold on to something . We 're losing oxygen . Get to the engine room . We can seal the airlock there . - Help me ! Oh God , help me ! - Hold on . - Hang on , son . - I 'm coming for you . Almost got you . A little closer . No ! - No ! - Nickolas , look out ! Kuttner ! Got you . Thanks . Come on , move it . Get your asses up here . - We have a problem . - What now ? The power is out to the airlock door . It 's damaged on our side . It has to be closed from out there . Anyone out there will be torn to pieces . - I 'll do it . - No , you 'll be trapped . - Captain , we 'll find another way . - You will do as you 're ordered , Doctor . You too , Mr. Borges . Send this thing back to hell where it belongs . And tell my wife she was right . I should have retired before this trip . All right , you bastards ! Come and get me ! My God . He 's gone . The captain 's gone . - Now what ? - I 'll tell you what . We throw that damn thing into the core like he told us . This way . There it is . The shock point drive . The most powerful machine mankind has ever created . How do we do it ? We throw it into the core over the edge of the platform . There . No , the shard ! I 've got it . Oh shit . I am so fucking sick of these fucking things . You and me both . Oh shit ! There 's too many ! - No ! - Get off , you son of a bitch ! Get away from him ! What is Stross waiting for ? Throw it into the core ! Destroy it . Stross . Stross ! Nolan , what the hell are you doing ? Destroy that thing now ! - God damn it , Stross . Gimme that ! - Don 't you see , Isabel ? - It 's too important to destroy ... - Oh shut up ! Throw it ! Throw it now ! - It 's over . - They 're dead . Finally . It 's finished . You know the rest . It 's a pity you didn 't come into direct contact with the shard . You have a fine mind and a strong will . I 'm sure it would have ... resonated with you , as it did with Stross . Oh my God . You knew what would happen if we found the fragments , didn 't you ? We are not ignorant of the marker 's capabilities . You didn 't just want the fragments . You wanted us exposed to that thing ! All that horror , all those deaths ... you did it on purpose . You have nothing to fear . In the end , you won 't suffer . - I promise . - I don 't understand . During our session we docked at the Sprawl . There is someone here who would like to speak to you . Ah , my dear Dr. Cho . It 's a pleasure to finally meet you . I 'm so sorry about any discomfort this process may have caused you , but you must understand how important this project is . Project ? What project ? Who are you ? I ? I am a simple Overseer to a greater purpose . We are working to change the face of humanity , my dear . Come with me and I 'll explain . Doctor , you and your team did a fine job . - My compliments . - Yes sir . Thank you , sir . I 'm very happy that you 're pleased . Very pleased indeed . Good day . Praise the Great Marker . I thought ourjobs might be in jeopardy . Do you think we might be promoted ? I 'm sure the Overseer will see that we are appropriately rewarded . As a doctor , you must see that the marker is the greatest discovery in the history of humanity . It has the potential to alter human DNA , to save our flawed dying species . It turns people into mindless monsters . Is that the kind of nightmare you want to unleash ? Its power is controllable under the right circumstances . We just need some more time to continue our research into the marker . Regrettably , these recent events have become too public . We need an airtight cover story and we 'd like you to help us with that . You want me to just forget everything that 's happened ? To my shipmates on the O 'Bannon and all those colonists on Aegis 7 ? We have significant resources dedicated to this project , Dr. Cho . You 'd be an important part of the team . In a few years , you could be heading the whole medical sciences division . Please consider helping us with this great work . I won 't do it . You 're playing God with human life . People deserve to know the truth . Isabel , I 'm truly sorry you feel that way . What ... Secure the patient . What are you doing ? Stop it . Get your hands off of me . Stop ! Let me go ! Everything is ready . You may proceed . - What are you going to do to me ? - Someone has to be held responsible . No ! Please don 't do this . Please , oh God ! No ! No ! Authorities today announced the arrest of a suspect connected to a recent series of terrorist attacks on the USG Ishimura , the USG O 'Bannon and a mining colony on Aegis 7 . Isabel cho , a former medical officer assigned to the O 'Bannon , was rescued from a lifepod recovered after the O 'Bannon 's engines were sabotaged and the ship destroyed . Interrogators have received a full confession from Miss cho , and sentencing is scheduled for next week ... The cover story is working well . People believe what they wish to believe , Dr. Edgars . Yes . Ah , it appears Dr. Stross has arrived . Excellent . That makes two who have come into contact - with the marker . - Two ? Who is the second ? The engineer who destroyed Aegis 7 . We found him half crazed in an escape shuttle . Imagine our luck . Synchronicity reveals the will of the cosmos , Dr. Edgars . Of course , Overseer . Be gentle with the patient . His mind is the key to the secrets of the marker . Yes sir . Welcome to your new home , Nolan . Welcome to the Sprawl . # Twinkle twinkle , little star # # How I wonder what you are # # Up above the world so high # # Like a diamond in the sky # # Twinkle twinkle , little star # # How I wonder what you are . #

 Just a normal day in Eureka : Day 's not over yet . Yeah , like that was gonna last . Hello , 1947 . Confused ? Let me clarify . The five of us got transported back in time , through some worm-hole thingy , thanks to the bridge device . We eventually found our way back home , but , surprise , home wasn 't exactly the way we left it . Henry ? Married . Zane and Jo never dated . But Jo 's in charge of GD security . Kevin , different , much to Allison 's surprise . And Fargo , the head of global dynamics , much to everyone 's surprise . Oh , and Dr. Old Spice hitched a ride back with us to the present , where there was one crappy rule . We can 't tell anyone . If people ever found out about our trip , we 'd be in trouble . And I finally kissed Allison . 63 years ago . Which complicated things a bit when I found out that Tess never left . Look at you , handsome . Tess ! You 're not in Australia . Yeah , that would be true . She 's pretty amazing . Must be why you asked her to move in with you . I spend a year realizing we don 't work as a couple . We break up , and she 's here , thinking that it 's great . But that 's Eureka for you . Same town , big changes . Last item , nolweps . Where are we ? On track , sir . You 'll be really pleased with the progress in that whole nolwep area . Good , so I can expect them to be ready for field testing by next month ? I 'll get back to you on that , sir . Today , Dr. Fargo . Today . Of course , sir . Over and out . [ Beep ] Sorry to interrupt . Just wanted to let you know I was running home - to see Jenna for a bit . - What 's a nolwep ? - What ? Calm down . - This job is hard . I can 't tell Mansfield I don 't know what he 's talking about or he 'll have me fired or killed , and I think those are the same to him . Okay , Fargo , take a deep breath . Nolweps are non-lethal weapons used for crowd control and peacekeeping . Dr. Parrish runs the lab . - Non-lethal . - Section three . Dr. Parrish . Got it . Okay , just so you know , he can be a bit of a handful . Maybe you should come with me . Fargo , you 're the boss now . You can handle it . Section three . I can handle it . - Vinny , can I get a coffee ? - You got it . And we 've got plenty more boxes if you need them . Thanks , Vince . Hey , babe . - Hello . - You excited ? About ... The movers coming today , yes . Oh , don 't tell me that you forgot . - How could I forget that ? - Okay , well , listen , they 've got the furniture and the big stuff . But I have at least another carload or two to go . I don 't trust some dude named Boris with my cat . Yeah . You 've got a cat ? We 're ... You know , I 'm ... I 'm more of a dog guy , but yeah , yes , yeah . My catadioptric telescope . Oh , that cat . You gave it to me for my birthday last year . Vince , I 'm gonna need a double . - Coming up . - Okay , honey , come here . Mmm , I 'll see you at home . Kinda love the sound of that . Home . Bye . What 's the matter , sheriff ? You don 't exactly look delighted that Dr. Fontana 's moving in . You should be . She 's a peach . Yeah , well , it 's ... No , shut up . It 's your fault . I already had to break up with her once , and it sucked . And now I have a second chance that I 'm not sure that I want . Well , I don 't know if that 's my fault entirely . Oh . And if you 're not sure , sport , don 't tell me . Tell her . Not that it 's any of your business , but I don 't want to hurt Tess . You can 't always be the good guy , sheriff , not that it is any of my business . Uh-huh . Have a good day . Good day . Wow . Look at me ... Oh , other me . Nice . I was gonna go with " disturbing " but okay . Thanks for coming with me , Jo . I 'm head of security now . You 're my boss ... Also disturbing . It says here I assigned Zane to the nolwep lab . Don 't care . So you 're not looking to rekindle things ? In this reality , nothing 's ever even happened . He 's that snarky jerk I first met , but I am not gonna let him get to me . Why does everyone keep avoiding me ? Dr. Fargo . Oh . I am ... I 'm so sorry . Are we gonna have to be worried about that ? No , no , no . Nope , all good . And I will have that report to you by noon today , sir . No one 's ever called me " sir " before . Looked to me like he was scared of you . Anson . Biological pathogens lab . Oh , no wonder . Apparently I moved the guy 's deadline up three times and wrote him up for underperforming . Other me is kind of a jerk . You didn 't get that from the posters ? Dr. Parrish , hello . I was hoping for a demonstration . Another surprise inspection . Goodie . They 're so productive . The latest nolwep prototypes are still in development . They 're not ready for demonstration . General Mansfield is expecting one . We just need to see what you 've got . Anytime you want , Lupo . Fine . Stand here . I can see why they didn 't want him in the lethal weapons lab . Unidirectional plasma field . Allows passage from your side , not from ours . Cool . - Zane . - Relax . Just shoots bean bags . Not cool . I told you it wasn 't ready . [ Bees buzzing ] Africanized honeybees . Since when are killer bees non-lethal ? They 're test subjects for the riot suppression system . Bee and human brain chemistry are similar . The R.S.S. Neurochemically induces feelings of serenity and trust . A crowd beamed with the R.S.S. Will peacefully disperse . Watch how it calms the bees . [ Energy pulsates ] Not seeing the calming . Still adjusting the signal strength . Does anything in this place actually do what it 's supposed to ? [ Metallic rattling sound ] I wouldn 't poke at those if I were you . They 're immobilization mines . I-mines shoot a gel webbing that hardens on contact , restraining ... Forget it . Just send me all your design specifications and fix this . Fix it all . [ glass shatters ] The bridge device ? Or what 's left of it anyway . I got a new name , I got a new identity . I need a project , and this ... Well , technically I own this already , so Douglas trucked it ... We cannot rebuild the bridge back to your time . And even if we could , you 've seen too much . I mean , it would be potentially catastrophic . Maybe we could use it for something else . I don 't know , it could be repurposed , say , for space travel . I don 't know , history 's full of accidents that led to invention . Come on , Henry ! The contacts are fried , and you 'll never be able to rebuild the power coupling . You say that , but I never had access to materials like this , technology like this before , not to mention your expertise . [ Sighs ] All right , there is a chance that I can replace the blown conduit with a high T.C. Superconductor . Chance favors the prepared mind . Louis Pasteur ? You 're giving me Louis Pasteur ? Come on , what do you say , partner ? For old times ' sake . [ Chuckles ] Let 's get to work " Do you want the good news or the bad news , General ? " No . " The nolweps are semi-operational . " No . What 's this doing out here ? [ Beeping ] Blinking . And beeping . Hey ! [ I-mine beeps faster , louder ] At least it works . Jo ? Someone ? Anyone ? Help . this was an assassination attempt ! Easy , Fargo . An assassination attempt with a non-lethal weapon seems a little pointless , don 't you think ? I almost suffocated . And these were my favorite pants . Sure it wasn 't just a prank ? Even if it was , this is still an attack on the Director of .D. Well , technically the other Fargo was director of ... Well , now this Fargo 's boss , and he demands a full investigation . And if you stop talking about yourself in the third person , I 'll look into it . [ Clears throat ] The head of security for G.D. , and I will look into it . Nice suit . The mine came from Dr. Parrish 's lab . We 'll start with him and Zane . Ah , Zane , what a shocker . Seriously , Jo , you dodged a bullet there . Smug , disruptive horndog bullet with his stupid t-shirts and ... Maybe I 'll talk to Zane . You talk to Parrish . Fine . Oh , hey , sheriff , vinspresso ? I 'm working . And then he 's unpacking . - Ah . - Uh-huh . Just taking a scone break . Oh , is it okay if I use the top drawer in the bathroom ? - Yeah , sure . - Okay . Oh , and my cat looks great on the mantel , by the way . The mantel 's for Mickey Mantle 's bat . His bat , not cat . Okay , yeah , I can ... I can put it back . - No problem . - Okay . Jack , what is going on ? [ Loud thud ] Nothing . Sorry , I ... Let me just deal with this . Hey , Zane , could I talk to you about the mine that went off on Fargo ? Booting me from one brain-dead assignment to another . The guy deserves what he gets . Are you saying that you did it ? I 'm saying he 's a tool . I 've been here for hours . Ask Vincent , law dog . Dah ! Zane , you okay ? Zane ! Za ... Wha ... You all right ? Any idea how your I-mine got into that hallway ? Aside from me putting it there ? Explain now . You heard Dr. Fargo . He demanded a demonstration , so I gave him one . I wouldn 't want his report to be incomplete , now would I ? Non-lethal weapons are very serious business . We 're not done . Dr. Parrish admitted to setting the I-mine . I knew it . Why does everyone hate me ? Oh , everyone doesn 't hate you . Most express indifference to mild dislike . Really ? I found this on the firing range . Don 't you think you 're kinda asking for it ? I want Parrish brought to justice . Oh , I 'm sure he didn 't mean any harm . Have you considered why he reacted that way ? Impossible deadlines , pitting labs against each other , surveillance everywhere . That wasn 't me . Why am I on the hook for what other Fargo did ? You need to talk to Parrish now , convince him and his team that you 're gonna reinstate a calm and respectful working environment . Oh , I 'll talk to him all right . We better go with him . Good idea . Ah , hey , sweetheart . You remember , Dr. Charles Grant , sweetheart . He 's our new science historian . Oh , it looks like they 've already put you to work , Charles . Uh-huh . Oh , barium aluminate . You 're building an electron gun . Can I help ? Oh , sure . Absolutely . I mean , it 's not ... It 's not gonna be terribly interesting . All right , you boys play with your toys . I will be at Cafe Diem editing that paper for the academy if you need anything . And I apologize for the state of the place , those shabby old tools . Sometimes Henry acts as if he 's been a bachelor his whole life . [ Chuckles ] You know , if I was married to a girl like that , that knew how to build an electron gun ... But I 'm not the man she married . Let 's ... Let 's try the circuit . Hey , Henry , thanks for this . It means a lot . Ready ? Yeah . - Here we go . - Okay . [ Machine humming ] Oh , my God . Oh , my God . We 're in business . I can attach the particle chamber directly , and the increased density will ... - Did you ... Just see that ? - Yeah . Good . What did we just do ? [ Clears throat ] Attention , everyone . I apologize for disrupting your work . - I apol ... Really ? - Do it . Fine . I apologize for disrupting things here today . Your work is important . Your work is important to Global Dynamics . And to me . Right . You sit up there in your office lording it over all of us . The only time you ever come down here is to harass us or snoop around . I didn 't want to put you on the spot , but general Mansfield needed ... Of course , Mansfield . And what 's that supposed to mean ? Okay , calm and respectful , Fargo . You 're nothing but Mansfield 's puppet , his lapdog , his tool . What 's up with the creepy eye thing ? You think you actually earned that fancy job of yours , kiss-ass ? Okay , there 's something wrong with him . Apologize , Parrish , or else . Fargo , just let it go . Or else what ? You gonna unleash your goons on us ? Well , who you calling a goon ? You 're just pissed ' cause none of the crap in your stupid Toys " R " us lab works . I 'm pretty sure the I-mine worked just dandy . Wouldn 't you say ? - Why you ... Apologize ! - Never ! It 's about time somebody stood up to you , you little tin pot dictator ! Shoot him , Jo ! Shoot him now . All right , everybody , let 's just calm it down , okay ? - Parrish , put down the gun . - Hold on . Put the bean bags down now ! Stop . Oh ... Ah ! [ Groaning ] Stop ! [ Alarm sounds ] Before something like that happens ! Allison 's taken everyone to the infirmary for testing . All discernable chemical leaks have been contained , but I 'm still ordering a lockdown and quarantine . I 'm back at " all discernable leaks . " Just let me do my job , okay ? Okay . Find out what 's making them act like that . And the freaky eye thing , first Parrish , then Fargo . Well , it could be some sort of a brain virus or ... or Hulk juice . Dr. Anson , meek little guy , dropped a beaker earlier , a red liquid . Anybody nearby could have been exposed . - Which lab ? - Biological pathogens . Bio ... And this didn 't concern you ? The biohazard filters didn 't show anything unusual . Well , it could be some sort of new , undetectable super germ . We gotta find out ... All posts , be on the lookout for Dr. Chris Anson . Detain him by any means necessary . Uh , Jo . I 'm wondering if you might have been a smidge exposed . I 'm fine . Everything is under control . Right . Fine . This is an outrage . I demand to be let go . So everyone is negative for chemical exposure from the spill . Leukocyte and histamine levels are normal . There 's no infection . So it 's not contagious . Fargo out . Fargo , wait . I 'm also seeing unusual levels of adrenaline , elevated blood pressure , and heart rate . I need to keep you under observation . I have a facility to run , in case you 've forgotten . And you 're getting in my way , again . Fargo , come back here . Blah , blah , blah . Keep everyone inside the infirmary , please . Hey , I got your call . You need a hand ? Yes , please , I really do . If you can ... Check her out . Okay . It has been a little tense around here today . Oh , yeah ? Not just here . Why , is something wrong ? Well , I was ... I was hoping that you might know . It 's like Jack has cold feet all of a sudden about the move . I finally make the leap , and now I 'm not so sure that he wanted me to . You know , Carter hasn 't been himself lately . Why don 't you just , you know , give him some time ? Allison , I 've given him the past year . I thought that we were on the same page about this , you know ? Yeah . Tess . I thought you were packing . Actually , I had her come in to work with Dr. Anson . Yeah , he 's been developing a viral psychotropic , - amongst other things . - Could that be the reason why people aren 't acting like themselves ? I sure hope so . Unless there 's something else that you wanna tell me . Stage three quarantine in place . - All exits have been sealed . - Look , I really gotta go . Yeah , well , take your time . We 're not going anywhere . This kinda thing happen often around here , objects disappearing into thin air ? No . Well , not a lot . Not to me . I can 't figure it out . All the components seem to be ... Inert . The device is not causing the dematerialization . Wait . What if I ... Oh , my God , it 's us . It 's us . It 's us ! Oh , hey ! Thought you might be hungry . So are you boys putting something together or are you taking it apart ? - Putting it together . - Taking it apart . Taking it apart again . We were actually debating under what hypothetical conditions a person might cause an object to dematerialize . Interesting . Possibly exposure to certain radiation . Pair annihilation would cause a huge gamma ray burst . We would have noticed the E.M.P. Yeah , what about passing through a small rupture in space-time ? [ Chuckles ] Right , but that 's impossible . Right , that 's impossible . Uh ... Well , carry on . Turkey sandwiches . Ugh . - There he is . - Dr. Anson ! What ? Huh ? What do you want ? One sec . Thought you said he was meek . He was . Okay . Why don 't you put down the giant lunch box of death ? Okay . Whoa , whoa , whoa . What was in the beaker you spilled ? Easy , Jo . You don 't wanna talk . Take it easy , Jo . Uh-oh . It 's happening to me too , isn 't it ? Yeah , big time . What did you do ? Okay , Jo , let him go . Let him go . [ Grunts ] Let ... Let him go . Let him go . There you go . Let him go . Let him go . It 's over . Okay . All right . Stay with me . Stay with me . Stay with me . Stay with me . With this , we find out what 's going on and we fix it , okay . Come on , come on . [ Grunts angrily ] Hey . Anson 's coat and the zombie juice he spilled on it . Great , this should help isolate the cause . Good thing too , because the medical results ... What do you want me to do about it ? See ? And it 's spreading . These people here , all new cases . What 's wrong with everybody ? I don 't know , they 're all angry . These are the physical and mental symptoms of rage . So we 're dealing with a bunch of mad scientists ? Well , some madder than others . I mean , everyone deals with anger differently , depending on personality , physiology , learned coping mechanisms . Emotional control can vary widely , but everyone here seems to be losing it . Losing it ? What do a bunch of pampered scientists have to be upset about ? Shh , shh , quiet . Keep your voice down . Everyone 's got stuff building underneath that they need to vent . Okay . Well , of course you would say that . You think that it 's better to let things go unspoken . What ? Sure , yeah , I mean , if it 's gonna make things more complicated or someone 's gonna get hurt . I think that Tess would disagree . I 'm her friend , Carter . She knows that there is something wrong between you two . - I 'm going to talk to her . - When ? Things are getting worse around here in more ways than one . Allison , I have everything under control . [ Shouting , scuffling ] Power grid failure . Emergency backup engaged . Power grid failure . Emergency backup engaged . You were saying ? I knew I shoulda gone with them . What is that ? An effigy ? Doesn 't even look like me . What are you doing about it ? I 'm trying not to throttle someone . Don 't push me ! Jeez , it 's like a Romero movie out there . Tested the stuff on Anson 's sleeve . It 's raspberry wine cooler . What is he , a High School cheerleader ? Well , unless it 's a new bio-weapon , we 're no closer to figuring this thing out . Okay , just say it . I drove Anson to drink on the job . Are you enjoying my failure ? All right , more tests on Dr. Parrish might isolate the neurological anomaly . Here come the big words . What genius idea does Dr. Perfect have to rattle out next ? - Fargo . - You people are useless . The situation is critical out there . You 're wasting time . Jo , Jo , Jo . Get outta my way , Carter . Wait , you can 't walk out , not like this . Right , because you know how to do my job better than me , just like always . That 's not what I 'm saying , trust me . Move ! Now ! Move now . Jo . Listen to me . Okay , listen to me . Wait , wait . You can hold this together . We can 't fix this without you . Jo . [ Groaning ] Fargo , let 's go . You can do this . Tess , are you in here ? Where the hell are my guards ? My staff is all gone too , and they let all the patients go . Not all of them . Tess must 've tranquilized him to help save him from himself . What 's wrong with him ? High fever , shallow breathing . Ahh ! [ screams ] [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] If this is happening to him ... The others will be getting worse , and so will you . I gotta find Zane while I still can . Oh , and it 's all my fault . Scientific discovery starts with bold ideas , you said . The me that never was said that . Yeah , I took the liberty of looking myself up in the archives . And there was no Nobel Prize , nor the institute that you founded . Well , no , because I wasn 't in my own time to do them . I was here . I 'm ... I mean , I am here . It 's confusing . Everyone I know is gone . Everything I might have done has been erased . So you see , Henry , this machine , it 's all I got . [ All shouting ] Zane ? [ Groaning ] [ Chuckles ] Look at you . [ Laughs ] What kinda career is this for a grown man ? You musta really rocked that aptitude exam . I wanted to be a librarian ! [ Groans ] You need to come now . Bite me , Lupo . Don 't tempt me . [ Groans ] Big affirmative on Zane being infected . I 'm taking him to the infirmary before I kill him myself . Copy that , Jo . Hang in there . We 're on our way . Jack , Jack . Tess , yeah ? Parrish came after me in the infirmary . - I had to tranq him . - Okay . Whatever happened to him is getting worse . Hey ! That 's G.D. Property . Oh , crap , run ! Run ! Go , run ! Go , go , go ! [ All shouting ] You 're all fired ! Good job , Fargo . Problem solved . This is insane . Most of G.D. was affected . Well , all of G.D ... Except for you , and me , and Allison . So that means we weren 't here when whatever happened happened . Right , so where ... Fargo ? Where 'd it start ? Eh , I 'm trying to think . [ Groaning ] [ Shouting , clattering ] We were all here before we got mad ... Parrish , Zane , Jo , and me . And now we just need to figure out which of the 50 projects could do that . I 'm going with the frisbee ray pointed at the tank of dead bees . Allison , we think we figured out where the anger epidemic started . Can you make it down to Parrish 's lab ? Yeah , that 's gonna be a problem . [ People shouting , growling ] Move . Allison ? Jo ? What 's going on ? Are you okay ? We 're trapped with two jerks and a murderous mob . Thanks for asking . Jack , we have to go get them . Yeah , we 're working on it . If I die because of you , Parrish , you 're a dead man . Very helpful , Fargo . You wanna check on the bees ? Tess ? Already on it . Why do I get the stupid " bee-topsy " ? Because you can 't kill dead bees . Allison , is Parrish there ? Can he help us ? Fargo , I 'm gonna kill you ! Do you hear me ? I 'm gonna rip that stupid face off that tiny little head of yours . That would be a " no . " And my head 's plenty big . Well , Parrish 's brain is basically overheating . It 's being flooded with vasopressin , a neurochemical linked with anger and aggression . No kidding . Is Zane there ? Can he tell us what the ray in his lab does ? The R.S.S. , it does three things . - One , two ... - Okay , never mind . Can 't you just ask Fargo ? Dealing with the bees here . Okay , okay . Deep breath . Happy place . The R.S.S. ? It was designed to produce oxytocin to induce a calming effect . Oxytocin differs from vasopressin by only two amino acids . I mean , structurally they 're almost identical . Vasopressin killed the bees too . Looks like the prototype triggered the wrong chemical . No , but that thing didn 't work . Parrish cranked it up and nothing . Yeah , but if the bees were already angry , could you even tell if they got more angry ? No , you couldn 't . The R.S.S. fires infrasonic waves . That means that it can penetrate through walls , which is why the whole building was affected . Okay , so what happened to Zane and Parrish when the ray went off happened to all of G.D. ? Oh , that 's just great . So the calming ray is an anger ray . What can go wrong next ? [ Clattering , shouting ] Carter , Carter , they 're getting in . Jo ! Jo , why ... Why are you ... All right , we lost Jo . Carter , the tranqs aren 't gonna hold . The vasopressin is overwhelming their systems . You have to reverse the effects fast . Carter ... Allison . Okay , we gotta move fast . Can you flip the switch , make the anger off , happy on ? Are you kidding me ? " Hello , I 'm sheriff Carter . I 'm gonna save the day with my everyman logic . " [ Laughs ] Hey , we 're on the same side , and I don 't sound like that . Yeah , you do . Well , a little bit , but look , look , look . I think that you might be right . I think that we can retune the beam . In order for it to reach people in time , we 'll have to amplify the signal and set it off in a central location . Hello ! Homicidal maniacs out there . Well ... I 'm thinking . No , no , no . I 'm the boss , me . [ Cell phone rings ] What now ? Dr. Fargo , I 've been expecting your call concer ... Go frak yourself , Mansfield . [ Cell phone beeps ] Fargo , not helping ! Pull it together , Fargo . This isn 't about you . Allison 's stuck in zombie land . Why are you so mad ? I thought you were unaffected . I 'm not ! You 're pissing me off ! Well , I 'm the head of G.D. , so you can shut the hell up and do what I say ! [ All shouting ] Attention , unruly ... Zombies . Attention , un ... Stop , stop . Stop . All this started with Fargo . Huh ? You want him ? Carter , what are you doing ? Go get him ! This is his fault . Carter ! It 's his fault ! You 're better than this . He 's a terrible man . Back off . Ahh ! He did this to you . Ahh ! [ Screaming ] Carter ! Carter ! Tess , do it now . Do it now ! Tess , do it now ! [ Machine humming ] Well done . Excuse me , excuse me . Fargo , Fargo . Excuse me . Fargo . Hey , it worked . Well , nice plan , Fargo . Ugh , I 'm just relieved everyone 's not mad at me anymore . I 'm still a little mad at you . I apologize for the I-mines , Dr. Fargo . It was immature and unprofessional . I 'm ... Glad you 're back to your old self , Dr. Parrish . You do have a tiny head . I 'm so glad . I 'd better call Mansfield and get the groveling over with . I bet you never had to do that . Yeah , you 'd lose that bet , Fargo . Hey , it doesn 't really matter if I think you can do the job , although I do . It only matters that you do . Wish me luck . So how 's anger management going ? Well , everyone 's gonna be okay , thanks to Fargo , and you , and Tess . She did a great job today . She did . She did , especially knowing how she feels about me right now . And not to mention how she 's gonna feel about me later . You gonna tell her ? Yeah . Yeah , what I can anyway . I 'm sorry , Carter . Yeah , me too . But you can 't always be the good guy . Right ? Our readings show only standard background radiation . So unless you can measure an aberrant quantum fluctuation ... No , there 's only one other option . We could be manifesting a negative stress energy tensor field . But if that 's true ... Then anything we touch could be sent backward or forward in time , and lost forever . Dr. Monroe , stay back . Why ? What 's wrong ? Don 't come any closer , please . Something 's happened to us , I can 't explain it , but anything that we touch ... Disappears ? And you can 't explain it ? Really ? I don 't understand . They 're for you . You 're always saying you 'll use those old tools of yours until they fall apart , so I coated them with thermal depolymerization paint . Paint plus body heat , poof . It 's a gag . It 's a prank . No , I ... I got it . I 'm just getting back at you for magnetizing all my pots and pans . That was one of your better ones . See , this is something that we do . - Is it ? - Mm-hmm . Okay . Henry , I don 't know what 's going on with you , but will you let me know when you 're yourself again ? She is something else . If I didn 't know better , I 'd say you had a little crush on your wife . Three , two , one . [ Energy humming ] Much better . Cleanup 's almost done . All the lab 's are pitching in . By tomorrow morning , you 'd never know we had a full-blown insurrection . Great . Guess I can 't avoid going home any longer . You were great today . How you kept it under control even with Zane , that was ... I couldn 't have done it without you , Carter . And years of special forces training . Well ... Hey , what you said about my thinking I know how to do your job and ... It 's fine . I wasn 't myself . Well , just if ... If that 's what you think , I 'm sorry . If I stepped on your toes , it 's just because I miss you . I miss my deputy . Wow . We make a good team . Always will . Yeah . So you gonna apologize for pulling a gun on me ? No . You had that coming . Yeah , think I know someone who might agree with you . Good luck . [ Door opens ] The movers ? I cancelled them . Fair enough . Was it the cat ? Was it ... the drawers ? I mean , do you just wanna slow things down ? Because ... No . Tess , you deserve the truth . So here it is . I 'm so sorry , Tess . I 'm ... so ... So sorry , but I don 't think we should move in together at all . So what next ? Well ... I think you should take that job in Australia . I think it 's what you 're meant to do , and I know that you 're gonna be happy there . How could you possibly know that ? I just do . The same way I know that you and I are not meant to be . And I wanted to save you the pain of watching it all unravel . Too late . Sorry , Tess . I love you .

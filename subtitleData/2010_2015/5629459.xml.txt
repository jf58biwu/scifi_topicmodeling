 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Claudia , your sister is alive . Nick broke into the Warehouse and released a guy named Paracelsus . Paracelsus was Caretaker of Warehouse 9 . Brilliant . He 's gonna make himself immortal . No ! Stop ! Too late , Agent Lattimer . Tell me how to use these things so I can save Myka . - Mrs. Frederic is ... - No longer the Caretaker . This is my house now ! I have to stay and fight Paracelsus . The Warehouse will protect me . You are the next . And you are the past . It 's over . Get out of my Warehouse . Looks like your Warehouse still has a little bit of a crush on me . Fancy . What else you got ? You 're wasting your time , Voldemort . I 'm as much a part of this Warehouse as you are , - and it won 't let you kill me . - Yes , you are , aren 't you ? Here 's a fun game . Why don 't we see if the Warehouse will let me kill you ? It occurs to me , if I control the Warehouse and you are a part of the Warehouse , then I control you . Thank you , child . So attentive . I 'm going to enjoy throwing your carcass into the lehmann fornax . Such a spirited girl . I 'll miss it when you 're gone . Come now . Show me everything you know . Aah ! Claudia ! - Need your treatment . - I 've done it . Joshua ! Someone used my time machine . Look beyond what you see . I cast you out ! Fascinating . You know , I , too , was thought to be mad . We have that in common . Except I 'm a normal human being and you 're a sociopathic murderer . - Other than that , we 're twins . - Up . Sit . Type . Who the hell 's Karl Schwarzschild ? What am I looking for ? You are going to help me combine a few artifacts to build something ... Something that will change everything . You 've had surgery . No strenuous activity , no exercise . No spicy foods . - Understood ? - Yes , absolutely . I 'm gonna go home and go straight to bed . - Pete ! Hi , hey . - Hey , hey . My friend is gonna take me from here . Thank you . Bye . Get me out of here . Wait . What ? So ... Wait , so ... so we 're ... We 're all good , right ? Yeah , we 're good . - Mykes ? - Pete . - Seriously . - Pete . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , but saying my name does not allay my fears . I 'm okay , okay ? It 's a bit of a wake-up call , but the cyst was benign . - Benign means ... - No , I know what benign means . - Well , good . - Does that mean ... - Do you mean ... - It means that I 'm fine . - So we 're all good downtown ? - Oh , my God . We are never talking about my lady parts ever again . Well , now , when you say , " lady parts , " does that mean the booby region ? - No . Enough . - ' Cause you know how I ... No . Just tell me what is going on at the Warehouse . Not much . Quit whining about the purple goo ! It 's a rental ! So how fast should I go ? As fast as you can ! And you 're sure that this is gonna work ? Yes , of course it 's gonna work ! You 've seen me do ... Fine , I 'll do it again . Look ! See ? Nothing to worry about ! You 're gonna get Claudia out of there ! All right , now , you back up about 200 feet and then get us in there ! I 'm on my way to meet Mr. Kosan and the Regents . They 're sequestered and unreachable at their retreat abroad . A hell of a time for a retreat . I don 't think a Warehouse coup was on anyone 's calendar . Have you gotten Claudia out yet ? Well , we 're just about to . Nothing to worry about on this end . Good . Keep me posted . Yeah . That didn 't work . And yet it felt so successful . Maybe if we double the goo and you go twice as fast . No , let 's wait for Pete to get back with Myka . Maybe they 'll think of something less life-threatening . All right , come on , I 've got another idea , only we 'll need a couple of crowbars and a crowded parking lot . Wait , wait , wait . How did Paracelsus become an all-powerful Caretaker ? Because I was making him mortal , okay ? So that I could ... Well , so that he could ... You didn 't know . Myka is dying . All right , look , I had two artifacts , right ? And then all the sudden , the stone became all sparky and smoky , and then all the sudden , he was out , okay ? He was out , and he tricked me , and I ... And ... I 'm a total idiot . Well , you 're not a total idiot . Why did you have two artifacts ? Because I was ... Do this , and I will help you combine the artifacts that could cure Myka . I was trying to ... Look , Myka , that 's not what matters right now , okay ? What matters is we need to get to this evil wizard because he 's probably planning something pretty bad , okay ? We got to get past the shield , we got to get back in there . - And we got to stop him before ... - The shield . Artie doesn 't know about ... Okay , you know what ? We need to get to the Innes Observatory right now . Drive , okay ? Just ... just drive fast ! - All right . - You can say , " emergency , " all you want , but it 's still illegal . Oh , please , of all the illegal things I 've done , this is probably the least illegal . Remember , we 're trying to save Claudia 's life . Yes , and that 's gonna be a lot harder to do from prison . Look , even if we get in there , how do we take down someone who 's immortal ? I 've been doing some digging . We 're gonna use the arrow that brought down the demigod achilles . Achilles ? Come on , that 's ... that 's a myth . Yes , it 's a myth . It 's a myth that 's currently stored on Aisle Corfu 783 . Now , take both the red and the black cable . At the same time , you touch them to the shield ... No , hold it ! Hold it . Hold it . How about I take one and you take the other ? Maybe I 'll stand a chance of living through this . Fine , if that 's what you want . All right , on three . One , two , three ! Damn it ! You all right ? Oh , no , I 'm fine . I 've got the black cable . Myka ! Are you okay ? I mean , is everything all right down ... We are not talking about that , okay ? What the hell are you guys still doing out here ? Am I really the only one that reads the Regent 's Addendums to the manual ? Okay , look , we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System . - I knew that . - No , he didn 't . I did . Continue . After Sykes used the shield against us , the Regents installed a fail-safe up at the Innes Observatory . We were just there . Really cool place ... telescopes . It was all explained as addendum NQZ-437 in the manual ! - I 've been meaning to read ... - I thought that was junk mail . My email 's all backlogged since I turned evil and tried to poison the world . - Okay . - That 's the best excuse . - He wins . - Anyway , I redirected the laser scope from the Centauri system to Uranus . - I thought it was pronounced ... - Uranus . It makes the shield appear to stay in place , yet we can pass through it . - Steve , if you would . - Oh , no . No , no , not today . Are you kidding me ? You big crybaby . We could 've just walked through ? Ur-anus ! Abigail got me up to speed on the Eldunari . I think I can disconnect Paracelsus from the Warehouse , but I 'm gonna need some cover when I go down there , and I 'm gonna need another pair of hands . Done . Steve and I will create a diversion while you and Myka go down and disconnect his mojo . Excellent . I 've got a plan I 'm absolutely certain will work . Trust me . Make him go first . I wish we had a gun or a Tesla . Nah , I shot para-cojones . It just pissed him off . But we have to pick up Achille 's arrow . Right . First , we got to create our little diversion . We 're here ! Hey , Para-normal ! Why don 't you come out and fight like a ... Claudia ! - Claude , you 're okay . - No , no , no ! Guys , listen ! And you 're battleready . Excellent ! Listen to me ! Paracelsus has control over my entire ... run ! You heard the lady . Let 's go ! Jeez , Claude ! Whoa ! Not cool ! Not cool ! You guys are just gonna have to run faster . Try and fight his control of your body ! Oh , my God , what a great idea , Steve ! I wish I 'd thought of that ! I can 't fight it . And these are Al Capone 's machine guns ! - What do they do ? - They shoot bullets ! Run ! Aah ! Oh , thank God . - Is it safe ? - Probably not . Oh , that 's a definite no . This was from Hitler 's bunker ... So it 'll probably blow up twice ! Yeah , twice . So this is where we disconnect Paracelsus ? We 've got to put the fires back in the alcoves and get the Nordic Symbols back on all the walls . So Abigail was certain about this ? Not entirely . We 've never had a Caretaker this strongly connected . But we don 't have a plan " b " so let 's give these a try . Oh , Artie , those are beautiful ... No ! Do not look in the mirrors ! They 're 4,000 years old . They belonged to an Akkadian Emperor . Sargon , the great . Legend has it that he used these to reflect sunlight into the eyes of his enemies , the Sumerians , blinding them ! Okay , I don 't see any Sumerians around , so what is the plan ? We will simultaneously reflect these flames into the adjoining alcoves , reigniting them . What happens if it 's not exactly simultaneous ? Unclear . The flames will probably consume us both . That sounds pretty clear to me . If Abigail is right , then the other two alcoves ... They 're gonna reignite , and that 'll restart the symbols , and it 'll disconnect Paracelsus from the Warehouse . - If Abigail is right . - It is not an exact science . I know . I miss exact science . On three . And one , two ... Wait ! There 's a lot of dust down here ! Two , three ! What about the other two ? - It 's a dead end . - I 'm really sorry . No ! No ! Artie , the other two ... They 're not igniting ! Wait . Wait . Wait . Oh , come on ! Ah ! Yes ! He 's not controlling me anymore ! Artie and Myka did it . Well , they sure took their sweet time . I should 've killed them when I ... No . It doesn 't matter . Oh , my God ! So what 's Paracelsus been up to ? You 're gonna hate this . - A time machine ? - H.G. Wells ' time machine ? But that only sends your consciousness back in time . Why would he want that ? He didn 't share , but he 's been mashing up a bunch of different artifacts and connecting them to it . Yeah , yeah , he was trying to get me to mix together a couple artifacts when I was trying to save My ... Ass . My ass . My ... ' Cause when ... Continue . Uh , he 's set up at the same spot Sykes found the portal . He forced me to help him . So after we set up H.G.s time machine , he rigged up the Tesla coil to power it . And then he started with different artifacts . There was a telescope from the Marquis de Laplace . French astronomer and mathematician . One of the first scientists to postulate the existence of black holes . What else ? Pocket watch - belonged to Karl Schwarzschild . The German physicist . Yeah , provided the first exact solution to Einstein 's field equations of general relativity . What else ? The last thing was very old sundial . Theodosius of Bithynia . I 'm so glad people today have names like Dave . He was , uh , the Greek astronomer , right ? Three very powerful artifact cogs in a possible machinery that lets you travel through time . So that 's why he 's at the portal . He 's planning a trip . But to where and to when ? Yeah , it doesn 't matter . We 've got to stop him . Right , we 'll meet at the portal . Pete , you three stop and pick up the arrow that killed Achilles . It wouldn 't hurt to pick up a couple guns too . I like that . Myka and I have to pick something up first . What ? I 'll explain later . - Go . - Jeez . Hey , he 's going through it . Pete , shoot . You lose again , Agent Lattimer . Welcome to the New World Order . You 're not gonna get away with this ! - Wait . - Take this . Ow . Artie , what just happened ? I 'm not s ... Wait a minute . Did he ... uh , Pete ? Yeah ? Whoa . Artie , look . His face ... It 's on all the banners . He was Caretaker of the last five Warehouses . He did it . He did something that changed everything . These banners clearly show a series of Warehouses , which tells me he did not alter history significantly , because the same empires still rose and fell . He was immortal when he went back , which would explain why he 's still around , right ? You know , I need to find that arrow and plunge it into his chest by hand this time . Look at the motto on the banners . " Scientia sit omne . " " Science is everything . " He 's focused the Warehouse entirely on scientific pursuits . Sorry about your steampunk , Artie . I want him dead . Yeah , but if the world changed , why didn 't we ? That 's why we gave you the forks . See , the Palace at Versailles was known to experience time-slips . And Louis XIV 's Silverware was somehow imbued with the power to keep him and his court in the same time continuum . Aha . Luke , use the fork . La , la , la , la , la , la , la , la , la . Don 't try and explain time travel . It never makes sense , and it always makes my head hurt . We 're here . The world is different . Let 's find Parry and kick his ass . Hey , guys , check this out ... Very Minority Report . This is light-years ahead of us . I mean , I can do some stuff , but it 's mostly ... Good afternoon . Welcome to Warehouse 13 . What the ... How may I assist you ? Wait , wait , wait . That 's a hologram . Programmed himself as the guide . He 's like that annoying paper clip . Jeez , the ego on this guy . Claude , can you just make him disappear ? Oh , it looks like his focusing on science led to some improvements . Really ? Like when he created immortality by slaughtering an entire village in 16th-century Constantinople ? Or the 200 hospital patients he murdered in cold blood ? Or maybe not . Look at the rest of the motto . " Media ad finem justificat . " " The end justifies the means . " Yeah , I don 't want to think about how many people he 's killed over the last 500 years . It 's gonna take me hours to hack this system . I mean , the way it responds to me ... It 's like it 's organic , it 's thinking . I got to get to the hub . Maybe that way I can get him . Yeah , yeah , no , wait , wait , wait . I 'm gonna need you to reconstruct his time machine . No , no , no , I can walk you , Myka , and Steve through it . Pete and I need to get to the hub . It might be the only way we can find out where he went and what he did , so Pete and Myka can follow him back through the portal and stop him from doing it . And since when do you decide who does what ? I just think we should make an informed decision , you know , like , about dead relatives , don 't you ? Uh ... Judging by the way these fiber optics are joining up , I 'd say the hub can 't be ... So you want to tell me what that was all about ? What ? You , Artie , tension , informed decisions and dead relatives ? I 'm sorry ... I left my Claudia / Artie code book in my other pants , so spill . Oh , man . They have borgs here ? Why does the creepy killer 's Warehouse get to be cooler than ours ? What 's on their eyes ? Oh , that 's an artifact from Warehouse 12 . Uh , Chester Moore Hall ? Oh , right , his achromatic lens , something about mind-control . I thought there was just one of those . What ? Oh , man . That 's the Spine of Saracen . That 's the first artifact that almost killed me . And now there are four of ' em . He 's replicating artifacts , artifacts that create unstoppable soldiers . Very good , gentlemen . Holy crap , it 's Valda . You can feel my commands without my having to voice them . Excellent . What is Benedict Valda doing here ? He died in Egypt in a pit of fire . Not in this reality he didn 't . I guess the Warehouse attracts the same people , - no matter what . - Oh , great . Maybe MacPherson and Waiter Sykes are running the snack bar . Okay , let 's go . - Wait , Claudia . Claudia , wait ! - What ? Do you think there 's a snack bar ? Okay , the time machine 's set up . What else do we need ? - Telescope , watch ... - Sundial . Yeah . Now , you two have ... What is that ? Oh , my God . They 're experimenting with artifacts . Pete said that was what Paracelsus liked to do , was combine artifacts . Artie , are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . It 's just that I remember things my parents used to say ... The kind of things that the doctors used to do ... In the camps during the war . He 's turned my Warehouse into a world of endless terror . Well , then let 's go stop him . Good to know locks haven 't changed that much . Or that I can pick any lock , even a futuristic one . Now , if we can just find the mainframe , hopefully I can ... Abigail ! Doc , are you okay ? What ... what did they ... What is your request ? I think we found the organic element I kept running into . Huh ? Paracelsus actually found a way to harness a human brain for computer power . Okay , Claude , we got to get her out of this . No , no , no , no , not knowing how she 's wired , we 'd likely kill her by doing that , but maybe she can help . I 'm sorry . That information is classified . Okay . I 'm sorry . That information is classified . Shall I contact Dr. Paracelsus for clearance ? - No , no , no , no . - Thank you . There 's got to be some , like , low-level info - that could help us . - Okay , let 's just ... Tiptoe , okay ? Sneaky , sneaky quiet . Okay . That Tesla coil may not have enough juice in it to keep the portal open long enough for Pete and Myka to come back through . We 're gonna have to start looking for another power source . What was that ? Well , even though the fork 's masked our physical presence here , we 're moving artifacts around , so Claudia was able to cloak that by hacking into the F.I.S.H. , but ... Yeah , there 's a power drain there too . - June 10 , 1541 . - Myka , set the date . Pretty sure he went to Warehouse 9 . - How can you tell ? - Because on June 10th ... All of the Regents of Warehouse 9 were killed in some kind of accident . And we all know who likes to kill large groups of people whenever he can . And there were never any Regents appointed ever again . So , after that , the Caretaker ran the Warehouse and supervised . Well , that would explain all the changes . Okay , you guys , no more time . Throw the switches . You two ... you 're gonna have to go back to Warehouse 9 . You 're gonna have to find him . Damn it . We lost the F.I.S.H. Intruder . There is an intruder in the Warehouse . Intruder . There is an intruder in the Warehouse . Okay , Pete , Myka , go back ! Stop him ! Claudia , you and Steve keep the portal open till they get back ! What are you g ... Hey , jackboots . I 'm guessing I 'm just your type . - Artie ! - Claude , Claude ! He 's probably gonna need you not captured so you can go and rescue him , don 't you think ? Yeah , right . You guys , go . We 'll fix this , Claude . Pete , come on . Hey , hey , you guys , save Artie . Hey , Pete , be careful . I 'm guessing because we have these forks , if one of us gets killed , we probably stay dead in either time continuum . No , no , no , no , no time-travel talk . Ooh , I bet I 'm gonna get blamed for that . Yes , that 's very likely . Prepare to die . Okay , look , I 'm really sorry about the arrow , and I 'm sure my partner had a perfectly good reason for killing all these guys . Pete , I did not kill those guys . Silence ! Or I shall silence you . Okay , off on the wrong foot . Hi . I 'm special Agent Pete Lattimer from Warehouse 13 . Lisa Da Vinci ... Agent of Warehouse 9 . Great . Lisa da ... Da Vinci ? As in ... as in Leonardo ? - He was my grandfather . - Really ? That 's amazing . Yeah , I mean , if you have anything that he 's ever drawn , hold on to it , ' cause it 's gonna go through the roof and ... - Pete . - Right . Lisa , what I 'm about to tell you is gonna blow your mind . We are time travelers ... From the future . Really ? Nothing ? Can 't I even get an " oh , my God " ? Oh , my God , what took you so long ? My grandfather 's been working on time travel for over 40 years . Well , we 've been working on stuff , too , like , uh , movies and television and popcorn . Huh ? I bet you don 't have that . You two are nothing more than strangely dressed killers from the future . Strangely dressed ? These are Prada . - Okay . - Good one . Thank you . Look , we did not kill these men , all right ? - Paracelsus did . - Paracelsus ? That 's impossible . He was encased in bronze this very day . Mr. Valda . Mr. Valda , this is ... this is wrong ! The Warehouse doesn 't use artifacts like this ! The Warehouse has been a leader in human experimentation for centuries . No , no . This is a false continuum . People who believe in multiple realties are generally considered insane . We have several artifacts that can cure that . Listen to me . This is the day , isn 't it ? I 'd almost forgotten . This is the day when I changed everything . 500 years and you 've learned nothing ! Just another single-minded ideologue turning science into fascism . Well , I 've replaced your creaky old storage unit with a state-of-the-art research facility . I 'm sure it will have impressed your associates . I 'm here alone . There 's no one else . I don 't even know h-how I got here . Oh , now you 're just being forgetful . Major Valda , shall we have the doctors see which combination of artifacts might jog Agent Nielsen 's memory ? You will be thrilled to see how much can be learned when we use artifacts as tools rather than collectibles . Quite useful to mankind . Doctors . We have a new volunteer ? There ... Jack Lalanne 's stationary bike should be enough to keep the juices flowing . Jumper cables again ... What could possibly go wrong ? I 'm gonna go save Artie . How long do I have to keep pumping ? Till Pete and Myka get back . Ride with your ass , not your knees . Always do . ♪ Crazy ♪ No , I know . I know I sound insane , but I ... but I actually do know you . I know you both very well . Vanessa , look at me . Look , we 're in love . I 'd use any excuse to see you . You 've removed my appendix several times . Well , that must have been some affair . What did we do for our honeymoon ... A kidney transplant ? Nessa , we 've been married this long . You 've never touched my appendix . Should I be hurt ? Listen to me . Paracelsus is abusing artifacts . He is torturing innocent people . Keep your voice down . This is for the advancement of science and the betterment of humanity . Yes , yes , it is . No , he 's a murderer ! Please be quiet . Please . He 's gonna hear you . So what ? So what if he hears me ? Please , please . - You 're afraid of him . - We are not . We 're good friends ... Very good friends . You 're lying . What you 're not telling me ? He has our children . Please just let us do our jobs . Now , this is Joan of Arc 's helmet . - No . - It will help you , and it won 't hurt very much . No ! Hugo , you 're lactose intolerant , you snore , you 're afraid to have a heart scan 'cause heart disease runs in your family . How do you know that ? Vanessa , you 've wanted to be a doctor since you were a little girl and your family dog was killed and you couldn 't save it . I 've never told anyone that . So , 500 years after you guys here at Warehouse 9 bronzed him , he got released . If the mirror proves you truthful , I shall help in any way I can . Well , thank you for trusting us a little . So how does this thing work ? Well , when I hold the candle against the mirror , it will show us the shadows of recent events . Oh , like the Durational Spectrometer . Oh , you 're serious . Are those real words ? You have a great smile . You busy after this ? - Pete . - Right . Lisa , if you would . Is someone there ? Paracelsus ? It can 't be ! Aah ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . I told you we didn 't kill those guys . He 's on his way to murder the Regents . We need to get to them before he does . They 're meeting today to appoint a Caretaker in place of Paracelsus . Where do they usually meet ? I don 't know . They 're very secretive . Well , if they 're anything like our Regents , they meet in public , everyday places , um , like a coffee shop or T.G.I. Friday 's , olive garden . Of course ! That 's it . - They 're at the olive garden . - Yes . Seriously ? White-chocolate raspberry cheesecake ? Do not tease me ! We have men scouring every corner of the Warehouse . If they 're here , we 'll find them . Well , maybe Agent Nielsen is alone . The others ... I need to see if some artifacts have been moved . Come with me . Vanessa , now , you know I 'm telling the truth . I can see it in your eyes . I don 't care how you know what you know . We have to do this . Yes . The pursuit of science is the only thing that matters . Now , this is a spindle from the very first rack that was ever used ... In the tower of London . Yes , I know . And that 's Bleckwenn 's Stethoscope . First physician that had any success with truth serum . Good . Then you probably also know that if used together , it might extract the truth . Yes . It also might fry my brain . Claudia . Thank God . Heartbreaking , isn 't it ? When someone you love , someone you thought you knew turns out to be someone else . I know you 're upset about your sister , but I 'm not someone else . I 'm still the same man that 's loved you like a father since the day you put me in electrified handcuffs and kidnapped me . I 'm just trying to protect you . You can 't , Artie . You can 't protect me anymore . You have to let me make my own mistakes , and you have to let me get hurt if that 's what 's supposed to happen . She 's right , you know . But I 'm afraid neither of you will be protecting anyone . I feel strongly a temporary Caretaker be named from among us . The Warehouse must be protected . The true Caretaker will show himself in due course . Et voila . Paracelsus , how did you ... - Guards ! - Your guards are dead . And how you cope in the next few moments will determine whether or not you join them . Your days are over . You see , I intend to lead the Warehouse into the future ... A future that will shake off the chains of fundamentalism , ignorance , and myth , a future that will proudly embrace science as the one true faith . So the question is , are you with me , or are you against me ? - I said , " are you with me ? " - No , we are not . No one person shall ever lead the Warehouse . - No , sir . - Excellent . That makes this much easier . Oh , a real olive garden . That elephant tusk ... What is it ? A tribe in Africa used it against it 's enemies . It 's the tusk of the only known elephant to have been killed by a Boa constrictor . All right , let 's get down there . Dude ! There goes our element of surprise . - There goes Paracelsus . - Wait . Wait . If you two approach that tusk , you 'll both be killed . Well , do you have any purple goo or ... What the hell was that ? The purple Swamphen , of course . You guys , be careful . There 's a giant , scary bird heading our way . I know . I called her . Thank you , Isabella . Paracelsus is probably headed back to Warehouse 9 . If he links up to the Eldunari again , he 'll be too powerful . Let 's go . What the hell is an Isabella ? Does the Warehouse in the future no longer use purple Swamphens to subdue artifacts ? - That 's insanity . - Guys , come on . Hey , Artie ... Alice could be here in a flash . Hugo , before you do whatever it is you 're gonna do , do you mind ... I don 't know ... Snapping our picture ? Whoa . He was definitely here . Okay , Peter , you head towards the Eldunari . Myka and I will circle around in case he wavers in his course . She 's bossy . - You love it . - I do . Let 's go . There goes the FI.S.H. Intruder . Intruder in aisle 487-k . No , no , not this time . I got a score to settle . Intruder in aisle 487-k . You remember this ? Wait . Let me take him . No , no , he 's mine . You don 't deal in lies , huh ? Huh ? Do you remember saying that to me , Parry ? Do you remember dangling Myka 's life out in front of me ? I did not lie . I believed she was dying . You know what I believe ? I believe we 're gonna have us a nice Paracelsii in the bronze sector . Please d-don 't , don 't . You have no idea what you are giving up , what you are stealing from mankind . You 're gonna make a nice Para-bookends . Now let 's go . You 're gonna have to kill me . Well , I 'm glad we agree about that . Oh . Good . I hope that hurt ! So then the problem was we had two bronzed paracelsii in the Warehouse , right ? You know , I do have better things to do . No , you don 't . No , you don 't . So is Mrs. Frederic reconnected ? Yeah , yeah , she 's back online . I just wish I could shake this ... - Uh , I don 't know . - Shake what ? Well , it 's this feeling that something is changing . I can 't explain it , but something has begun . It 's good and bad . I don 't know . Never mind . It 's not comforting , definitely not , and I wish that you were lying . I wonder if this has something to do with my trip . You 're leaving ? The Regents have asked me to meet them abroad ... Very hush-hush . Oh , I always love that about them . And here we are . Ta-da ! " Ralph Brunsky , Egyptian terrorist . " Yeah . There , okay . Oh , hi . Now put him in the bronze sector . Aw , dad ! Now , or you 're gonna be grounded for a week . Question ... Okay , I hate that tone of voice . Why do you have that scalpel you threw at Paracelsus ? I don 't know , Myka . It was just in my pocket , and sometimes I pick things up . You said that you had two artifacts when you released Paracelsus . The scalpel was one of them , wasn 't it ? Oh , my God , I feel like I 'm talking to Columbo . Lisa said that it has curative properties . You brought it to Paracelsus , didn 't you ? I don 't remember , Myka . That was , like , two time-travels ago . I heard what you whispered into his ear at Warehouse 9 , Pete . You did it for me , didn 't you ? What ? No . Why ? No . What ? Okay , yeah , maybe I did , all right ? So sue me . I didn 't want you to die . So you risked the Warehouse and the world just to save me ? Well , yeah . - Don 't . - Ow ! Okay ? We always put the Warehouse first . I am your partner . I am not your girlfriend . All right , all right , jeez . I 'm still gonna put you first . Why don 't you go punch that ? Your plan to pull Alice out of that mirror would have absolutely worked , you know . It was a brilliant , brilliant idea . I haven 't forgotten about Claire . I want to know about my sister . I know . You never forget anything . But could I maybe just recuperate from all that for five minutes before ... I guess not . What ? 11 . There should be 12 . Hmm .

 I want to space on a 13 month solo mission I didn 't go home alone . My husband created a life like android Called it humanity His name is ethan , he 's the protype This is a story about earth Ethan ... . A story about family . A story about survival . Previously on extant : You were right- - They 've been conducting experiments on astronauts , All off the books . I 'm pregnant . H-how 's that even possible ? Once I get this to the lab , The dna test won 't take long . That 's all I need . Molly : I was talking to tim earlier ? John : Tim who ? Dawkins . Marcus ' brother . John : Tim ... Molly : He 's here . He 's out there at the party . John : No , he isn 't . Molly : I can 't keep Going on like this , john , I got to go Get some help . Whatever 's going on in my brain Is getting worse , and fast . ( gasps ) Man : Dr. Barton . Pull over . I can 't do that . Pull over ! ( thud ) ( tires screech ) Look in the back . All clear . They 're gone . Molly : We should have dropped ethan off with julie . John : We 're a family . We go together . I don 't like this . Well , we can 't stay here . Where was sparks taking you ? Quarantine . Sam said get out of the car , so ... But if this baby is ours , then Why would he take you to quarantine ? What 's he trying to cover up ? People were gonna Lose their careers over it . And maybe he was trying to save his own . I deactivated ethan 's tracking , just in case If they try to use him to get to us , but We can 't hide forever . They will find us . I just need one day . I 'm gonna do the dna test myself And then we can go home . Here , Right here . Sir . Yes ? The vehicle 's abandoned in a parking lot . We 're scanning footage from aerial drones To determine where they went . Probably not far . Their passports are upstairs , They didn 't access their bank accounts . They left in a hurry . What kind of priority are we talking about here , sir ? I 'll have to get back to you on that . ( beeping ) Verdisign : Phone call from director sparks . Where would you like to take it ? Private , please . Yes ? We have a bit of a situation with molly woods . She resisted my attempts to bring her in to quarantine . Where is she now ? We 're tracking her down . We 'll find her . You don 't sound optimistic . I gave her every chance , but we are where we are . Yes , you gave her the opportunity To come in willingly , And now we must try another approach . Given , as you say , We are where we are . I understand . ( beeping ) Mr. Yasumoto , welcome . Thank you For accommodating me on such Short notice . It 's our pleasure . I 'd be happy to show you our latest development . No , no , please , allow me . Ten years , and we have come so close In replicating The meteor substance . Have you minimized the danger ? To a degree . Of course , there are still Improvements to be made . While we 've eliminated damage On contact with the skin , We haven 't completely ruled out Any risk to the respiratory system . Excellent . As you can see , We are on the path to being fully operational . And the healing properties ? We 've had encouraging results . I see . Would he mind taking off his mask ? We are not prepared for that level Of exposure . You mentioned That you minimized the danger . It 's true . But not without consequences . I 'd like to witness the progress myself . It is , of course , your choice . ( deep breath ) There . Good . Progress has been made . What 's happening now ? Anton . Anton , anton . ( alarm beeping ) Anton , anton ! Anton ! Anton , anton . ( gasping ) Anton . Anton . Aw , look what the tide dragged in . ( laughs ) Come here . Oh . Hi , daddy . Hey , baby girl . ( deep breath ) Thousands of miles up to the heavens And then back here again . Whew . Still just as beautiful as ever . Hello , quinn . John . Well , wow . It 's the admiral of the 7th fleet , no doubt . Hi , grandpa . Hey , look , I took the liberty of providing Transportation for you . You know how to drive yet ? I 'm not allowed to . Oh , what a travesty . I 'll tell you what- - you can ride stowaway In the back- - how about that , huh ? ( laughs ) You don 't plan to stay long , do you ? Uh , it 's a bit of an impromptu visit . Just for a day . We 'll be back soon . Yeah ? That 's what I said 40 years ago . Your mother , she dreamed of living in paris . When I told her I was gonna set up my practice here , They used to call this the , uh , paris Of the pacific . Of the pacific , I know . You 've heard that before , haven 't you ? ( sighs ) we just had a really long trip , daddy , So can we just get to the house ? ( boat horn blows ) Sure . Just for a day . ( sighs ) Hello ? Anybody ? ( beep , lock clicks ) Yes ? Look , I know- - I entered An off-limits area . I blew it . I expect to be disciplined , but I 'd really like to go home now . Director sparks requested that you wait . He should be here any minute . ( stammers ) Can I at least go to the bathroom ? I 've been ... ( scoffs ) Oh ! Sparks : We 've detained sam barton . She tried to destroy a sample of molly 's blood . I 'm fairly certain molly told her about the pregnancy . And the blood sample ? If I had to guess ... She 's trying to determine the dna of the baby . It 's critical That she not get the answers she seeks . I understand . I 'm not sure you do . My experiments at recreating The life-sustaining substance Have failed . Time is running out . The answer may be in what molly brought back inside her . I can 't unring the bell . Now that she 's asking questions , She won 't stop until she gets an answer . Then it 's time we take her out of the equation . She 's done her part- - she brought the baby here . We can take care of the rest . There 's the issue of sam barton . She 'll need to be taken care of , too . I 'm confident you 'll find a way . ( phone beeps off ) ( barking , panting ) Molly : Gus , here , boy . ( whistles ) Ethan : Here , boy , come on . Gus . Gussy . ( growling ) quinn : Oh , hush , that 's just molly . What 's going on , boy ? Quinn : Gus . What 's going on ? Aah ! Hey , what the hell you doing ? Get out of there , move . He bit me . Oh , come here . Look . Aah . Now let 's get in the kitchen , have a look . Come on , let 's go . I 've never seen gus act like that . Put that on the bite . Okay . Thanks . Yeah . I don 't know what came over that dog . Well , I haven 't been here in a long time . Six years . I get to see you guys on a visit To mainland , but it 's not the same . This is home . People ask about you a lot . You made quite a name for yourself , young lady . Here we go . Uh , so john and I would like To go through some of my old science equipment . We think ethan would like to play with it . ( gasps ) ooh . Is that your story ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Well , the first time in six years You come marching in here with just A single duffle bag for all of you ? How are your meetings going , daddy ? Oh . Good . You answer a question with a question . ( laughs ) Good work . You still didn 't answer my question . I don 't need the meetings anymore . I had a few slips , but I have it under control . I have not had a drink in a couple of years . Yeah , of course , it 'll take A couple more before you 'll give me a chance , huh ? ( smacks his lips ) ( chuckles ) How 's the patient ? I 'm better . This place is cool . Wait till you see your room . I have a room ? You do now . Used to be mine . Want to see it ? Sure . Come on . It 's up there . Aerial drone footage tracked them to the docks . John woods chartered a boat there this morning . Vaspar island . Her father has a house there . You have a team on standby ? We 're moving out on your word . Go . But keep your distance until I call . How 's this going ? Oh , she 's tough , But everyone has their limits . Ethan : Ursa minor , ursa major . Pisces ? Mm-hmm . Keep going . Andromeda . Aries , Taurus ... That 's where the seven sisters live . Have you heard that story ? No . Okay , well , one day , the seven sisters Were playing in a meadow , and a hunter named orion came Upon them . He fell in love with them , and wanted to catch them , But they ran away . Their dad Complained about orion , So zeus turned the sisters into doves , and Scattered them throughout the sky . And that 's where they live , as stars . He 's still chasing them . Every night . My mother told me that story . ( laughs ) Do you remember her name ? Maia . That was the name of the oldest of the sisters . That 's probably why she liked the story so much . Does it make you sad when you think about her ? Sometimes . But when I 'm having a bad day , I just look up there , and I see her face . I don 't see a face . Well , keep looking . You never know what you might see . I 'm gonna go help your dad . You start school yet ? I only went one day . Ah . Make any friends ? A girl . Ah . Of course you did . Yeah , chip off the old block . ( chuckles ) Oh , boy . Looky here . You want to see something cool ? Â¶ dah , dah , dah , dah . Dah . Pop . ( laughing ) Can I try ? Of course . So , first thing , Let 's find a suitable specimen . Ah . Now , the key is to throw it so it skips over The top of the water , kind of like with a ... A sidearm action , huh ? Like this . Wow . Okay ? Here , you try . Ah , no , no , don 't be so hard on yourself . Takes years of practice . Nice toss . ( birds squawking ) The kid 's got an arm on him . I 'll say he has . ( chuckles ) Let 's go home . Your mom 's waiting for you . ( chuckles ) come on . You ever think about playing , uh , football Or baseball or something ? Hey . Hey . Your old dna isolator is still here . Oh , please tell me it still works . No . But I can gut some of this junk , jerry-rig a fix . How long ? Uh , an hour or two , tops . Everything else we need is right here in this bag . So , when we do the test , and it 's ours , what 's next ? We have the baby . We have the baby ? Yeah . You look happy . So do you . ( laughs airily ) It 's just , I-I ... I could never have guessed That it would happen this way . I didn 't think it would happen at all . What are you guys doing ? Um ... Hey . Want to tear apart an old dna isolator ? Sure . ( door closes ) Mmm . ( sighs ) Ethan seemed to like the beach . It 's hard to know what ethan likes . Look , I didn 't come here to fight with you , daddy . Okay . I can see that you 're trying . I 'm trying , too . Well , it seems I 'm a-a much better grandparent Than ... Than I am a parent . Do you think you could do me a favor ? Okay . And take ethan into town for some supper tonight ? Sure . Any special reason ? Um , well ... John and I could really use a few hours to ourselves . It 's been a crazy couple of weeks since , um , my reentry . Okay . ( sniffles ) Um , any special instructions ? No . Just , um ... Bring him back before bedtime . I can do that . Well , If we 're gonna hit to town , I 'd better go change clothes . ( both laugh ) Team 's in place . They 're awaiting your signal . Thank you . I wish I could get in your head . Concealing molly 's pregnancy , Destroying her blood sample . How exactly was that in her best interest ? You implanted an embryo without her consent . Don 't talk to me about her best interest ! At 11 : 34 p.M. , you sent her a text , " get out of the car . " What exactly do you think is going on here ? Oh , I think you 're covering your own ass . Well , maybe it 's time you did the same . Where is molly ? What did you do to her ? You haven 't the faintest idea what you 've put in motion With your little stunt . I was trying to help her . And now I 'm going to try to help you . Help me how ? How long have you worked here , sam ? Are you threatening me ? 'cause let 's face it , alan . You don 't have a leg to stand on . As soon as this goes public ... All right , I 'll answer my own question . 15 years , right ? From med school straight into the academy . Top of your class . I was always impressed . I 'm not saying another word until you let me see molly . You 'll probably want to talk . Eventually . It seems like you 've been hiding a lot lately . Your brother- - You did an exemplary job Of covering up his past . Erased his old identity and manufactured a new one . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I mean , what could he have done that was so unforgivable That you had to go to such great lengths ? Alan ... Then I heard A very compelling story About a 19-year-old boy , A suspect in the shooting death of an unarmed man , his roommate , Ten years ago . And the strange part was , Before the boy could stand trial , Strings were pulled . He was transferred to a minimum security mental facility On the advice of a well respected physician . Don 't do this . Of course , the judge was never informed That the physician was related to the boy . His sister , In fact . Billy ... Didn 't know what he was doing . He is stable now , He 's on the right medication . He 's not gonna Hurt anybody . Let 's hope not . But he 's in a very ... Fragile stage in his recovery , Vulnerable to all kinds of dangers , Pitfalls seen ... And unseen . What are you planning to do to him ? Alan , please , Just leave my brother out of this . This is a situation of your own making , sam , And one that only you have the power To change . All you have to do Is help molly . What do you want me to do ? Right now , Just enjoy your chat . The rest , we 'll talk About later . Sammy . ( exhales ) It 's billy . Hey . Hi . Hi . ( sniffles ) You look great . I have a status update . Is the team in place ? We 're waiting on your word . Consider this the go . I don 't think she 'll be an issue for us anymore . And , gordon , I assume you 'll take every precaution To keep this as seamless as possible . I 'll call you when we 're done . We 're a go . Ethan , Would you be honest with me if I asked you a question ? Yes . Did anything happen At home that made you leave the house All of a sudden ? We had a party for my mom . What kind of party ? A late birthday party . For when she was in space . They have secrets . Who ? My mom and dad . I hear them arguing , But then when they see me , They stop talking and act funny . What do they argue about ? I don 't know . That 's okay . Everybody 's got secrets . Even the best of them , huh ? Nobody 's perfect . Man : Hey , quinnsy ! Hey , griggsy . Who do you got there ? Uh , griggsy , that 's my grandson , ethan . Ethan , This is mr . Griggs . Pleasure . I take it mol 's on the island . Just for a short while . A couple of squid crews just rolled in to the anchor . Just screaming to take their money away . Feeling lucky ? Look , I promised Ethan 's mother that I 'd bring him home For bedtime . Ah , well , Another time . See you , kid . Hey , ethan , How about we kill a half hour ? Hmm ? ( whirring ) Nice . Angle it , angle it . Okay , now push it in . Yeah . Molly ? Don 't let me go . What 's wrong ? He was here . Marcus . It 's a hallucination . Like tim . You don 't believe me ? I believe you 're seeing things . But you can 't believe what you can 't see , right ? I want it to stop , okay ? So let 's get this test done . Then we 'll go home and get you the help you need . All right , son . Any time you 're ready . ( cheering ) That 's my boy . Man : My wife is gonna kill me . All right , now , for the brave of heart , Time for a final wager : Three in a row . Come on , come on . Good luck , quinnsy . This time ... It 's gonna be double or nothing . ( crowd chatter ) All right . All right , kid . Show ' em your magic now , okay ? Man : No way , kid . Come on , ethan , We 're waiting . ( loud crowd chatter ) Son of a bitch . Come on . Let 's go . Man : Aw , come on , come on back ... ( indistinct chatter ) Get in . Hurry up . That was real money , kid . Lots of it ! What the hell happened ? Sorry . Sorry ? Yeah , sorry don 't cut it . Sorry don 't give me my money back ! Take a whole bunch of sorry , and it adds up to nothing ! You ever think about that when you were screwing up ? No . Of course you wouldn 't . Why would you ? You have no regard for anybody else having a good time . Nobody 's perfect . Oh , no . Are you kidding me ? Is that why you missed ? Because of what I said ? Oh , that 's not What I meant , kid . That 's not what ... Yeah , I left that gate open for a reason . ( clears throat ) ( sighs ) ( gate creaking ) Think your mom and dad , um ... Kid ? Ethan ? Ethan ? ( muffled screaming ) What do you mean , you lost him ? ! Well , we were driving back From town , I stopped to open up the gate , And the kid was gone . Gone how ? ! Well , I went to open up the gate , which you shut ... I didn 't shut it . And then , when I got back , the kid had run off . I can 't reactivate his tracking sensor . Something 's wrong . It could be these woods . The reception is bad . Okay , look , daddy , ethan wouldn 't just Get out the car and run off . What did you do to him ? Nothing . Daddy ! Well , I-I-I might 've snapped at him back in town . You did what ? Hey , hey , hey , well , I thought That the kid was not gonna be reacting like that . He 's a robot . What happened ? Well , uh , we all went to the anchor bar , You know , to toss a few rings for the guys . And was doing fine until he tanked the last toss . You used ethan in a bar game ? ! Have you been drinking ? Ah , well , I just had a ... Little pop . Oh ! Wait , wait , wait a minute . Did it ever occur to you that maybe your son Ran away because of you ? Don 't you think he knows What 's going on here- - all these secrets and lies ? What kind of trouble are you in anyway ? What are you talking about ? All these secrets and lies . You 're both acting Like a bunch of fugitives ! And-and don 't you pretend That it 's my fault . You guys are running away from something And you 're not admitting it . Oh ! Coming from the expert . All right , all right ! That 's enough ! We need to contact the sheriff . Is there a local search and rescue Out here ? Yeah . Okay . Call them . Until they get here , We 'll search for ethan ourselves . We go separate directions . Your dad stays here In case he wanders back . He 's smart . He won 't stay out long . Okay ? Okay . Wait , wait , john ... What if it 's sparks ? Well , we have to stick with what we know . Ethan was yelled at . He 's programmed to react as a human . So he just probably ran off . He 's in these woods Waiting for us to come get him . Right . Okay , okay , okay . Okay ? Ethan ! Ethan ! ( muffled yelling ) Mom ! Clear . Fire in the hole . ( screams ) Did you see the direction he ran ? It 's somewhere in this direction . My back was only turned for a minute . We 'll need a piece Of your grandson 's clothes so the dogs can track his scent . We can search ourselves . A-any word from molly ? No , not at all . Then we need to get your men out there As soon as possible , please . Just hold on . That 's dangerous terrain . I got 400-foot cliff banks Straight down to the water , so it 's gonna be A hell of a lot easier to find your son If the dogs could track his scent . Well , I 'm afraid that 's not possible . Why not ? Because he doesn 't have a scent . Come again ? He 's a , he 's a humanich . A what ? A robot . He 's built To look like ... Us . I know exactly what you mean . I read all about those things . We 're done here . Sorry , doc , but I 'm not risking my men and dogs to track down A machine . We can find him when the sun rises . But that 's hours from now . Where do you think you 're going ? I 'm going to find my son . My wife is out there looking For him . If you won 't help me ... Maybe we can fan out and go in Four different directions , we could ... What ? Doc ? Stay out of this . ( groans ) It 's not like the thing is gonna starve To death or freeze . Please . Please , he-he can be in real danger . Ooh , of what ? Rust ? ( grunts ) ( dogs barking , overlapping chatter ) Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan . ( panting ) Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan , talk to me ! Ethan ! ( low rumbling nearby ) Come on , baby . Come on . Oh , come on ! This is ridiculous . We can 't stay here . You hit a cop . What did you expect- - a la quinta ? You 're here till morning . Can I at least have my phone so I can call my wife ? Yeah . I 'll ask the sheriff . I 'm sure he 's in a giving mood . John ... Please , quinn . Not now . Molly will find him . ( muffled , indistinct chatter ) Â¶ Â¶ ( muffled , indistinct chatter ) ( both grunt ) ( panting ) Â¶ Island 's been cleared of all personnel . Anything else ? No , gordon . We 're done here . ( chuckles ) that 's funny . What 's that ? Feels more like we 're just starting . I 'll see you back on the mainland .

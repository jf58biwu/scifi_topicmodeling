My shrink - her name 's Megan - she would give me all these mental checks I could do , like counting down sevens and stuff , but I 'd look around at these other guys . One guy 's , like , spinning hankies like they 're propellers . Another guy 's rocking back and forth , clapping , going , " Megan , Megan , Megan , Megan , Megan , Megan , Meg " - So I stop her . I stop her . And I go , " Listen , you got to get me out of here . " And she tells me I 'm sick . And I go , " Yeah , I know . But these motherfuckers are crazy ! " - [ chuckles ] - You 're a piece of shit . That was a setup . - Maybe . Maybe not . But there 'd be days where I 'd think , I got to hold on to that stuff for when I 'm with the guys . And then there were other days where I 'd wonder , why the hell would you give me a second chance ? I 'm not going back there . I promise . - Well , enough of this depressing shit . This was supposed to be a funeral . - You were gonna tell me something before ? - I was just gonna do a toast . To the only mom who let us play monster tag at 2 : 00 in the morning . - Or let us eat a bowl of Cheezies with milk on them . - It tastes like Kraft Dinner .

Seems like I 'm nursing a hangover . - See , I thought that this was a boys ' weekend , not a little boys ' weekend . - Just a little something for my brain to idle . - It 's not idling , Jim . It 's reverse . Jesus , hanging out with " Katie , did you pack my puzzles ? " And ... " I 'm unleaded now , remember ? " Doctor 's orders . I can 't drink anything . " - Ev , Ty had nothing to do with this . - No ? - I went for a walk . - Great . We all came up here for you , and you want to be alone , in the dark , in the woods . Well , as long as everyone else is comfortable with that . - I got it . [ can clatters ] - I don 't know why I always have to be the one ... You guys have to stare in the face of some shit . - Listen , Ev . I need you to have my back . - With what ? [ engine rumbling ] [ engine stops ] - I 'm nervous . - Me too . - Why are we doing this ? - ' Cause Chris would do it for us . - Shut the fuck up . All right , Jim ? - Yes . [ sighs ] - Just keep walking . You 'll know it when you get there . Trust me . - [ clears throat ] What am I supposed to say , Ty ? Am I in the wrong place ? - This is the part where I tell you that I 'm not crazy . It was - It was a box .

Can you see it ? - Do you smell crossed wires ? - Yeah . Can you hear it ? [ squeaking , skittering ] I 'm not dreaming ? You guys are here ? - Yeah , we 're here . - You don 't know what it 's like to feel your mind stab you in the back . I came out here , and I see this thing - this crazy thing - what was I supposed to think ? - Anybody got a Kleenex ? - No , I 'll be okay now . I just thought I was alone . - What is this ? Did we discover something ? - [ laughs ] I don 't know . I don 't know . I don 't know what this is . - Come on , Telecom , you 're supposed to be the brain here . - [ humming ] - You 're not scared ? - No , man ! I am pumped !

Maybe it 's like the northern lights or Bermuda Triangle . - [ muttering ] Except that it 's a rectangle . - And it doubles every time we go in there . How does it do that ? - How does it do anything ? I mean , I don 't know . I mean , somehow , we must be stimulating its growth . Right ? Sort of like Bob 's hair pills . [ chuckles ] - Hey , yeah . - You 've been looking in my shave kit . [ VCR clicks off ] What kind of a bitch move is that ? - Man , don 't be paranoid . I 'm just ripping on you some . Apparently , that 's what we do , right ? - Yeah , well , how did you know ? - Well , I thought we all knew . - You 're gonna pay for it , science fair . - Oh , what ? You gonna rough me around too ?

Twinkle , twinkle , little star . How I Wonder what you are . [ click ] - Guys , how long has this thing been out here ? - I knew something was telling me to find it . - She called it a door , but you called it a corridor . - Mom said a lot of things on a lot of tapes . She was nuts . - Did you ever ask yourself why ? - Reverse that doubling out there , and it could have been pretty fucking small for a pretty long time . - I 'm packing my shit to go . I can 't hear this [ jet engine whines ] [ muffled pilot radio chatter ] - [ chuckles ] I can hear you . [ radio chatter continues ] [ knocking ] - Welcome to the oxygen bar . - If you seriously think Mom was crazy 'cause of that place in her head , like a tumour , then why am I crazy ? - Maybe you 're not . - Then why did that happen ? - Maybe it needed to . To give us a shove . Ty ... How did I get stuck working at the same fucking school that we all graduated from ? Maybe now we get to look to the future because the future came to get us .

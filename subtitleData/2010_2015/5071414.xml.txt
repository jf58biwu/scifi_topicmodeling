 That 's 77 now dead from the suspected outbreak of Russian ? u . My father had a degenerative illness called Deel 's syndrome , where his entire body shut down . Why is my brother still a suspect ? - Is that all of it ? - Do you think kept a piece ? This has one number on it , mine . Don 't tell anyone you have these . Police have a suspect in custody , a Russian national named as Anya Lutvchenko . Anya ! He is the beating heart of all of this , and if we can find his identity , it ends and you go home . That 's who Mr Rabbit is . - Alice ! - Shut her up ! - Ian , is she OK ? - Please , stop her screaming , now ! Can 't stop her screaming ! She 's lost her fucking mind ! Stop her screaming or I 'll drive this van into a fucking wall ! I 'm not saying we dump her . What are you saying then , Wilson ? - I 'm saying we can 't look after her . - Ssh ! She must have grandparents , or relatives . Why are you even saying that ? You know they 'll be there waiting if we go within a million miles of her family . So , what 's your big idea , Becky ? Don 't fucking have one , shit-head ! Couldn 't we just leave her somewhere , like a police station or a hospital ? You might as well put a bullet in her head right now . Are you suggesting shooting her ? Of course I 'm not ! What the fuck is the matter with you ? All right , all right . Pack it in . We ... we have to take her with us . It 's the only thing we can do . - No , look , just call Milner . - called at six . You saw me . The next contact time 's midnight . Taking that girl with us is insane ! How are we going to look after her ? It 's not just her life ! It 's Grant 's , it 's ours ... Right ! Right , right , I 've had enough of your shit . I 'm taking her with us . You don 't have to come if you don 't want to . What ? What ? What do you mean ? What ? Like a break-up ? Yeah ! Yeah , if you 're going to be all fucking you know . Mr Rabbit was supposed to be our ticket out of all this . - There 's still Milner . She 'll help . - Yeah ? And has it occurred to you , the only reason why she 's not answering is because she knows we lost the manuscript ? Taking Alice with us is not a good decision . She needs help . This will end bad . All she 's got is us . Did you see how she looked at us ? Like we 're terrifying . Becky , she 's in shock . No . She 's right . We 're scary . That 's what we 've become . We 're just like them now . What 's that ? A piece of finger ? How did you get involved in all this ? Remember SARS ? worked for the Martarla Foundation who discovered it . One of their top scientists , a rising star , six-figure salary , use of a private jet . Have you ever been on a private jet ? It 's nice . Was in Hong Kong when SARS hit . They kept it locked down , but thought , " Fuck that , I 'm special . " So went in , had a look , found out it didn 't exist . What ? SARS didn 't exist ? No . Whole thing was just a series of unconnected respiratory infections . Took me under an hour to discover that there was no cause or link . So , filed my report ... and within a week was discredited , research destroyed fired . Tried speaking out , but everyone thought I 'd just gone a bit David Icke . But people died . SARS was ... Started in November 2002 . It lasted precisely seven months . By summer 2003 , it no longer existed . The " pandemic " affected just 8,422 people and killed 916 . Do you know how many people die each year from random respiratory problems ? SARS did not exist . Next question . Why did they do it ? Answer. don 't fucking know . All know was within the next few weeks was embroiled in a sex scandal . Professor Pervert , addicted to coke and prostitutes . - So , did they ... did they just set you up ? - Yeah . Well , no . ... Do like cocaine and prostitutes , but they didn 't have to tell anyone . I 've never heard of Martarla . No , no-one has , but you 've heard of the parent company . Corvadt ? Um ... why don 't you come back tomorrow ? I 've got a lot of tests . - Tomorrow ? No fucking way . - I 've got to do some more tests . Am not leaving that here . Come back at one . ... promise I 'll have something by then . - Where are you going ? - There 's a thing have to ... said one . OK , yes , did the test , and it 's flu . They 're right , Russian flu . No , no , you 're lying . Where 's the sample ? Can 't give it you back . mean , it 's infected , and I 'm not lying . - What 's in there ? - It 's papers . - It 's nothing but papers . - No , no . Cw ! Cw ! - Please , please , please ! - Is this it ? Is this it ? It 's not what you think . Oh , Jesus Christ . It was chemical poisoning ! No flu at all ? You have no idea how powerful and rich they are . Let 's split it . You want to use this for money ? They ruined my life and deserve compensation . Deserve it ! Wait ! Think about the money ! Jesus Christ , it 's massive ! Yeah , told you we 'd find the place eventually . Is it time to call Milner ? Yeah . Let 's just pray she answers . Come on . Come on . Arby has the manuscript , but there are pages missing . He thinks Jessica Hyde removed them . And there 's something else . Think he had her ... and think he let her go . You 've gone all goth . I 'm in hiding . We have to hide . Are you OK ? Alice , do you want to talk about what ... I 've got an essay due Friday . How am going to get it in ? It 's on Crime And Punishment . need to finish it . Do you have a laptop ? What about paper ? Is there paper ? There must be paper ! I 'm on for an A ! - I 've got paper . - don 't want my mark to drop ! - Alice , I 've got paper . I 've got paper . - How am going to get it in ? Get it done . I 'll find a way . Staying in one place is stupid . So is going cross-country with a child who 's having a fucking breakdown . Don 't make me the bad guy . I 'm just ... Why am even ... mean , you 've both decided , haven 't you ? You 've both ... Fuck . Oh , fuck . Come with me . Just come . Come on . We can 't go to a restaurant so thought we 'd make our own . Our date , remember ? Come on . Menu 's shit . We 've got , um ... salt and vinegar crisps . Peperami and cheese . Oh , my God ! This is shit . And the only drink 's Fanta . Hate Fanta . - Is this a table-tennis table ? - Mm-hm . Oh , and after we 've got a movie . Stare at that and ... describe the plot to Spider-Man 2 . Thank you . Have you still got those pages ? Jessica . You haven 't told anyone about those pages ? - No ... - Don 't . Don 't tell anyone , Grant . Just you and me . OK ? I 'll be around . I 'll keep an eye on you , promise . What ? Are you leaving ? Keep this up ... or you 'll die . Are you sure you don 't remember the name of Mr Rabbit ? Just it began with an L. What 's over there ? Grant ? What were you hiding when came in ? Drawings ? You did drawings of the manuscript ? Why didn 't you tell us ? Well , they ain 't very good . Can 't remember her name . The woman in the book . The woman Raskolnikov kills . He kills this woman , this ... old woman . He kills her , and can 't remember her name . You can just say " the woman " . No ! can 't ! need the book ! Where 's the book ? - Need it ! - We haven 't got the book . No ! can 't ! need the book ! Where 's the book ? It 's OK . Alyona . Alyona Ivanovna . I 'll go get you some more paper . Give us that . Give us it ! - I 'm using it . - just give me the paper at the back ! Popeyed shit-legs . Don 't know . never really knew what wanted to do . My brother was always nagging me about squandering my brain . Thought was a genius . Miss him . He 's ... he 's very driven . Psycho-driven . This reminds me of him . He was mad for table tennis when we were kids . I 'd do anything to see him again . Well , this is nice . Better than drunk shagging and angry shagging . - Yeah . Though shagging was nice . - Hm . Problem for you , though , is , how are you going to get in my knickers without me being drunk or angry ? Yeah . Well could try telling you that like you . That think a lot about your lips , your eyes , your smile . Could tell you that know you 're in the room even before I 've seen you . And could tell you that despite all this madness , murder and mayhem there 's a corner of my soul that feels like it 's coming alive because of you . Mm , yeah . That might do it . Good . Oh , fuck ! - Shit ! - Don 't worry . It ... it was an accident . - Fuck . Becky , it 's OK , it 's OK . Um ... the great thing about this place you can spill anything . You 're never gonna believe this . I 've been looking at these drawings that Grant did of the manuscript . What are you twats doing ? What ? Er ... Grant did drawings ? Yeah , just a few . And , no , not of Mr Rabbit . But ... do you remember this ? The scientist makes a thing called a ghost cell which he puts into a buffalo . The buffalo 's killed , fed to the man , and the man rots . Yeah . It 's what all the BSE conspiracy stuff was based on . Yeah , yeah . Look , and then Grant 's drawings . The scientist creates a god with two faces and the god goes inside the ghost cell . Roman mythology ! A god with two faces . It 's Janus . And that 's how they get it into us . Via the food chain , the same way they did with BSE . - But it would be noticed . Testing . - Maybe it looks like something else . There 's tons of bacterial shit in food , and if Carvel 's a Nazi ... Like what ? A disease that targets certain races ? What if it 's not the disease that 's selective ? What if it 's the cure ? Russian flu . Corvadt are making the vaccine . Right . How do you get flu ? Somebody sneezes and you breathe it in . No . No , no . You ingest it . Mostly you get it on your hands and you ingest it . So , they adapt some fucking weapons-grade flu virus so that it can be hidden in food , and Corvadt make a vaccine that 's only effective on certain races . Mean , after Fetlar , people are terrified . One more outbreak like that and they 'll be rioting to get it in their arms . Fuck testing ! - But you 'd need it in so much food . - Yeah , you would . See that symbol ? It 's everywhere in part two . Don 't you recognise that symbol ? Pergus Holdings . They 're massive . They 're like Kraft or Nestle , and they manufacture everything from crisps to fizzy drinks to pet food , and that is their logo . Fuck . - Have a nice date ? - Jesus Christ ! Where have you been ? Are you and Becky an item now ? Where the fuck have you been ? The phone Milner gave you . - Take it out and call her - No , Jessica . Look , don 't know what your game is , but am not going to be part of ... Call ... Milner . Voice mail . Tell her you 're with Jessica Hyde . It 's Ian . I 'm with Jessica Hyde . If they were tapping her phone , you 've just killed her . You still think so small , Ian . So ... IT . " Gone to get supplies " ? What is it with him and notes ? Becky , if show you something , will you ... Becky , if show you something , do you promise not to get angry ? No , show it me ! Found it in the van . Don 't ... don 't worry. turned it off . But if we were to turn it on ... We need to find out about Pergus Holdings . Now , can download malware that will confuse the IMEI of this . Any search will make it look as though ... So , let 's go for a walk , then . Do it from far away , to be safe . - Hey , how ... how 's Alice ? - Grant said all she 's talking about is getting her essay in . It 's like she 's switched off , or something . Do you think she 'll be OK ? ... Dunno . - Here 's great . - All right . First , check we 're alone . You look up there , and I 'll look down here . We lost the manuscript . No , you listen ! Tell me what 's going on ! Like , what , are they infecting people ? Are they ? Stop lying . That 's bullshit . Look , need to see you . Tomorrow morning , 6.15 . I 'll send you my location . I 'm in trouble . - All right ? - Yeah . It says here Pergus were a small-time processed-food company up until 1993 then , suddenly , they started buying subsidiaries in Europe , Africa , South America . They 're everywhere . All right . What happened in ' 93 ? Er ... a new CEO . Lane Monroe . Shit . Lane . L - Is that Mr Rabbit ? What , him ? Fuck it , I 'm gonna get his address . Oh , maybe I 'll have a look for my dad . You know , he would have p ... - No , no , don 't . - No , it 's a perfect opport ... We can 't risk . Yeah ? What 's this ? Lied. did keep a piece . Kevin Baig , resident of Fetlar , listed dead from Russian flu , Thursday 14th . This says he was poisoned by chromic potassium sulphate . Want Anya released . It 's the child . Christ ! It 's the child . should have known . I 've copies with lawyers . Sealed . They don 't know what it is , but they do know to send it to press if don 't phone in every two hours . Do you know how stupid you look ? Don 't do this , Michael . Come on . We 'll wreck your life , we 'll do so much damage ... Release Anya . Yeah , well , we 're not going to do that . You 're proving yourself surprisingly unpredictable . We need collateral , so we can 't release her , can we ? Now , what does surprise me is that , given you know what we are capable of , you still seem to think you can negotiate . Now , obviously , we can 't hurt you physically , because of your supposed lawyers , so ... Is that Jen ? Mm-hm . You ... you hurt her , and will have nothing to lose . - You remember that . - Alexi , give us a wave . Alexi has a folder . It contains photos of you and Anya fucking , of course . Dates , times , a scan of your baby and a rather lurid DVD . Now , give me everything you have by 8pm or he will hand it to your wife . You see , there are lots of grades of hurt we can do to a life and we have the will to inflict them all . - Have they seen you ? - Milner ? Jesus , is that you ? Have they seen you ? Yes or no ? No . No , they haven 't . 'M sending a distraction Get out of there now . Hey ! Milner , I 'm sorry ! just need to see ... Fuck ! Do you think this is a fucking game ? Is that it ? You stupid ... No , no , don 't ! just ... I 'm sorry ! Sorry ? They have your families staked out ! You were picked up three times on facial recognition . If hadn 't managed to intercept it , you and your brother would be dead ! What kind of a risk do you think that puts me in ? Just wanted to see him ! I 've had a team on you all morning . They have no idea what this is . Don 't know how I 'm going to explain that little sideshow . Why is there a message on my phone from you about Jessica Hyde ? She had a gun to my head . thought she was setting you up . You lost the manuscript . How ... how do you know ? I 'm a spy . It 's sort of the point of what do . What 's interesting is , the person who took it still has it . That means we have a chance . We 're a mess . The others are worse than me . We 're not up to this . Well , you bloody well have to be . Look , Carvel finished Janus before he died . He wrote it into the manuscript . - So , it 's in the manuscript ? - Yes . And whatever Janus does or is , it 's in those pages . Think know what it is . We figured some stuff out . Good God . Is that the manuscript ? read it . There 's a boy . They torture him . He has one comfort . A sweet . Chocolate raisins . You lied . That boy is long gone . They ripped everything from you , even your name . You think you 're called Arby . But that 's not your name . That 's not a name , it 's initials . RB . Raisin Boy . That 's what they called you when they forgot who you were . I 'm all you have , Arby . Where is Jessica Hyde ? If see anyone else there , I 'll kill them . And destroy this . What was my name ? Pietre . Your name was Pietre . think you might be right , Ian . Monroe ran secret nerve agent research for the CIA before Pergus . He 's Network , definitely . But for now it 's all about the manuscript . There are several parties searching for it . Jessica will be the one that finds it . And what makes you think she 'll come back to us ? Where else does she have to go ? You 'd better get back . Don 't tell your friends about this thing with Roy . They need to believe in you . You 're doing well , Ian . Raskolnikov desires the power of life over death . He kills the old woman , because he decides that the world is better off without her . But really he wants to discover what it 's like to end a life . He deduces that killing a human is right in the pursuit of a higher cause . Yeah . Yeah , that 's great , Alice . Reckon that 'll be an A , definitely . - So , you found out where Monroe lives ? - Yeah , we did . We need to go there . Er ... Wilson ... with respect , don 't think you 're thinking straight . We go , we find Monroe and we see if he 's got the Chinese character for " rabbit " carved on his belly . Then what ? We ... whack him ? He 's right . We go . I 'm sick of waiting for people to save us . So , she kissed you ? On the mouth ? - Did you kiss her back ? - Becky , she had a gun to my head . Did you enjoy it ? Well , suppose she 's attractive ... in a kind of skinny-bitch , evil murderess kind of way . Are you Becky ? Yeah , am . I 'm Alice . Get in . want the manuscript , and you are going to take me to it . Of course . That 's why I 'm here . The latest batch of vaccine . We agreed you 'd do the testing . I 've arranged for a car . It 's waiting downstairs , take you to the lab . So one of us nips in the garage goes up , breaks in and forces Monroe to buzz the rest up . - Which one of us ? - He 's an old white dude . Who 's he gonna be more scared of ? You look like a psycho pirate . Yeah . Where are we going ? Up there . See the prick that did this to us . What the fuck is he doing ? ... been farming here on this land for nearly 80 years but , according to Jarrod , no-one around can remember a time when the crop was this bad . Many are saying if the rains don ' 2' come soon , they 're finished . But for some it is already too late . - Is it money ? Do you want ... - Get up ! You need to open the garage door . My friends want to talk to you . Oh , no . No , no . All right , listen . Have done everything that you asked . - All right ? - Let them in . - Now . - All right . All right , all right . OK . Don 't do this , OK ? have been loyal . - You haven 't done what we asked . - What ? Did. did everything . What did you do ? You did nothing . The GCHN1 protein is everywhere . made sure it was everywhere . What more do you want ? All right . All right ! OK . Oh , yeah . You 're not them ? Surprise . Come on . Move ! All right , all right . Look , you stay in there and whatever you hear , don 't come out . Fuck . Right , well , if he 's not Mr Rabbit let 's just leave . He knows something . He 's talking about ... Grant ? What about my essay ? It 's late . We need to get it in . Ain 't gonna happen , Alice . Alice ... Your mum ... Is it him ? In there ? He did this ? What 's the GCHN1 protein ? Please ... I 'm not ... Oh , look ... I 'm no-one . Was just doing what was told . - Why don 't you answer the question ? - Oh ! What the fuck are you doing ? It was a protein that we bred into foodstuffs , OK ? A modification of corn ! We bred a corn with a softer husk . It could be ... it could be broken down used in animal feeds . It saved farmers billions . Everyone wanted it . - What does the protein do ? - Do ? It doesn 't do anything . It contains a modified amino acid that helps with the softening process , but it 's not necessary for it . The amino acid is absorbed harmlessly into the body . So , you went through all that trouble to get this amino acid in food - and it does nothing ? - Look , I 'm just a cog . Was paid . was just doing what was told . Who 's Mr Rabbit ? Christ , don 't know that ! Who do you think am ? Do you know about Janus ? You know that name ? If you 're a cog , then how come you know about Janus ? That 's my dad . Becky , that 's ... that 's my dad . So ... so what ? They ... they killed him ? They ... they killed Dad ? Wilson ... I 'm so sorry . No , no , no , no , no ! - Wilson , no ! - Wilson . Wilson , don 't . You said he was alive ! You sat down with me and you said he was alive ! - Had to . We ... we couldn 't risk it . - Did you know about this ? - Yeah . - You 're supposed to be my friends ! We are ! We are ! You 're not ! None of you ! You lied ! - No ... Please ... - They killed him . - They killed him . - No ! Wilson , leave it ! The concierge knows I 'm here . If don 't answer that , he 'll come up ! Wilson ? We need him to answer . Grant and Alice are here . - Please . - It 's all right . - Come on . Come on . - Come on . Whoever it is , get rid of them . Send them up . You fucking little shit ! Er ... right . Right , you ! Move ! Right . Grant ? Point that at his legs . If he moves , shoot his knees off . Fucking yes ! Monroe . It 's Letts . Conran Letts . Jesus Christ , what are we going to do ? Monroe ? Hold this a sec . You and need to talk . Monroe ! Open the door ! He killed my mum , Becky . Jesus Christ . What do we do ? Ian ? We go now , and we take him with us . OK .

 The machine is my best chance of getting home . Walter 's not gonna help me recalibrate it , so I 'm hoping Walternate will . I need to cross over into the alternate universe . - Put your hands behind your head ! - Don 't move ! Our universe has been infiltrated by shapeshifters from your side . - Your defense secretary 's behind them . - We 'll sort it out . Nobody knows you 're here but us . Secretary Bishop , I came here because I needed your help to get home . And I will do everything in my power . But you must go back to the Other Side and tell them whoever 's behind this is a threat to us all . You 're chasing a story of a suspect left in a closet . - What if he 's right ? - What if he 's not ? We have to tell Broyles . - They 're on their way to you now . - We 'll be waiting for them . No , you 're making a mistake . Your defense secretary is covering his tracks . He has been inside ... Colonel Broyles . Mr. Secretary . - What are you doing here , sir ? - I understand you have a detainee . Agent Lincoln Lee from the Other Side . That 's right . Who 's this ? Please see that Agent Lee is released immediately . As for the rest it 's best I explain in private . Shapeshifters ? You 're certain about this ? I wouldn 't be here if I weren 't . And if the Department of Defense can be infiltrated then , clearly , every branch of our government is vulnerable . - You 're suggesting ... We have reason to believe your Agent Murphy may have been one of them . We 'll know for sure as soon as he 's autopsied . - Any idea who they 're answering to ? - No . Nor do we understand their end what their agenda is . We might know more soon . Agents Lee and Dunham ran a trace on Murphy 's last call . They 're following up as we speak . I don 't know . I 've known Murphy since the Academy . He 's a straight arrow . You know , I just got a hunch this other Lincoln 's telling us the truth . Must be because he has such a trustworthy face . - See , I think he 's kind of funny-looking . - You 're funny-looking . - Don 't move . - Put your hands up . Do you know what she is ? A shapeshifter . She was once just a human being , like any other . - Until you killed her . - Oh , she 's not dead . Though in a manner of speaking , she was . A bookkeeper for an accounting firm . Can you imagine anything more lifeless ? I suppose this is what it feels like to have a child . To love as a parent does . You must be very proud . Oh , I am . Of all of them . Forty-seven so far . And each one perfect . I 'm so sorry . - What are you doing to it ? - To her ! Isn 't it obvious ? Now I 'm killing her . Why 'd you do that ? Because you don 't know me or what I 'm capable of . But if I 'm willing to do that to someone I love dearly imagine what I 'll do to people I don 't care about . - And what is it you need ? - From you ? Nothing . You don 't have the authority . Take me to your leader . How 's the cheese coming ? Is it done soaking yet ? Ah . Agent Dunham . Hey . Look . - Spherical pastrami . You hungry ? - Uh ... No . Heh . Thank you . Um , I was looking for Astrid . Hey . Walter 's just discovered molecular gastronomy . I liquefied the meat , then placed it in an alginate bath . - It 's really quite ... - Disgusting . The thing about scientific inquiry , not every experiment is a success . But I hold high hopes for the parmesan ice cream . You 've had a fun day ? The best . What 's up ? I was hoping you could do something for me . Uh ... Could you check this blood sample against the international databases ? Am I looking for anything in particular ? I don 't know , a name , a genetic marker , anything out of the ordinary . What 's going on ? You seem troubled . I helped Peter and Lincoln cross over to the other universe . Since Walter 's refusing to help Peter get back to where he 's from he thinks that Walternate may help him . And Lincoln 's doing recon on the shapeshifters . Whoa . What does that have to do with the sample ? Probably nothing , but can you call me if you find anything ? - And wish me luck . - Where are you going ? Why do you need luck ? Because Broyles doesn 't know about this , does he ? Peter and Lincoln should 've been back . I 'm gonna have to go and tell him what 's been going on . Ha . Good luck . - What do we know ? - That he is certifiable . - Apart from that , nothing else . - ID ? We didn 't find a show-me . No surprise there . We ran his biometrics through all the Criminal , medical , insurance . Based on his accent , we reached out to Scotland Yard . Nothing . - Anything at the location ? - Cleared it out before we got there . - Science division 's doing a sweep . - He knew we were coming . - He was waiting for us to show up . - Take him to Interrogation . I 'll meet you . And this time , use an actual room , not the maintenance closet . - Yes , sir . - Yes , sir . Thanks . You hear they 're bringing up the suspect ? What suspect ? The guy who 's behind trying to have us killed . The guy behind the shapeshifters . Sir ? Your escort should be here shortly . Thank you . - What escort ? - We 're leaving . Wait a minute . We might finally get some answers . We should stay and assist with the interrogation . No . I got Walternate to help me . I don 't think the way to say thank you is to tell him how to do his job . - That 's it ? You got what you wanted . Yes , I got what I wanted . And whatever he finds out , he 's gonna share with you . You got what you came for . I want to get to the Other Side , study the blueprints ... I need to be a part of this investigation . I lost a partner . I lost a universe . - You 're scared . - Yes , I am scared . I 'm scared every day I stay here , the people I love get farther away from me . So let them do their jobs . There 's nothing that you can do here that they can 't do for themselves . What is it ? You know that guy ? I 'm Colonel Broyles . I 'd like to ask you some questions . I 'm sure you have an abundance of questions . But I doubt I 'll answer any of them . Besides which , we don 't have much time . I imagine you 'd like to avoid unnecessary deaths . We 're not in the business of responding to threats . Oh , I wouldn 't call it that . Consider it an insurance policy . An agent of mine , a shapeshifter posing as Doctor Brandon Fayette was taken offline earlier today . In his office above his desk , there is a light fixture . Remove the outer frame . Tucked inside , there is a hard drive . You have 12 minutes to bring it to me . - Twelve ? - Not to worry . I 've been assured that by helicopter you can make it to the DOD and back with two minutes to spare . - What 's on the hard drive ? - Go . - We 'll call on our way back . - It 's nothing of interest to you . Though I 'm sure you 'll copy the contents before you let me go . Before we let you go ? Of course . Anything else you want while we 're at it ? Um , I wouldn 't mind a cup of tea . I imagined you 'd be on your way back home . I know who that man is . His name is David Robert Jones . - Go on . - He 's a scientist . He has a background in biotechnology and genetic weaponry . We 'd have a record of him . We don 't . He 's not in any database . Because he 's not from your universe . He crossed over from the Other Side . How can you be so certain ? You already told me that things are different from your timeline . - Let me talk to him . - Sir , I hardly think that 's wise . Do you have my tea ? Hardly . I do have some questions I 'd like to ask you though . Funny . The last man in here said the same thing . You 're not from here , are you ? Did the accent give it away ? No , actually , it was the scars . Did you see that ? His pulse just went up . The last time I saw you , you were completely falling apart . Molecular disintegration due to transporting out of a German prison . They had to wrap you in bandages just to keep you from turning into a puddle . It seems you 've figured out a way to heal yourself . Do you mind if I ask ? What was it ? Some sort of DNA graft ? I 've never met you in my life . No . But I 've met you . Where ? When you were crossing out of your universe into this one . You created a doorway , a portal . I 'm the man who closed it on you . It cut you right in half . Interesting story . Yet , I 'm still in one piece . I believe you 've run out of time . - This is Broyles . - I have a woman on the line who says you 're expecting her call . She says she 's a friend of Mr. Jones . Go ahead . Is Secretary Bishop on the line too ? - Who is this ? - Can Mr. Jones hear me as well ? He can . What do you want ? Just for you to listen . Dr. Samuels , do you want me to give that girl with the bike injury a tetanus ? Not necessary . I don 't think she 's gonna make it . Open the door ! Let us out ! Let us out ! Yes ? Uh , sir , can I speak to you ? Is this about Peter and Agent Lee ? You know ? That you helped them cross over to the Other Side without authorization ? Yes , I know . I just received word from my alter ego . Needless to say he was as amused as I am . - Are they okay ? - They 're fine . We 'll deal with your insubordination once we 've resolved the situation . What situation ? Take a seat . You ever heard of a man named David Robert Jones ? - No . - Neither had I. He 's been in prison for possession of state secrets . Three years ago , he broke out . Apparently , since then he 's made his way to the Other Side . There were 16 people in the ER . All of them dead . He says if he 's not released within 14 minutes , the next attack will be worse . What do you want to do , sir ? - Prepare him for release . - What ? You can 't be serious . I understand your concerns , agent . I can 't , in good conscience , allow him to continue to attack civilian targets . You think capitulating is gonna make him less dangerous ? Tell them . Tell them this is a terrible idea . - What idea ? - They 're gonna let Jones just walk out . Do we know what 's on the hard disk ? He was accessing government satellites . Astrid 's reviewing the data now . Obviously we 'll be keeping him under constant surveillance . This situation may even play out to our advantage . We may learn who he 's working with , where the other shapeshifters are . We can monitor him with an internal tracker . - That 's a good idea . - Glad you like it . I put one in his tea . Agent Lee , Dunham , start organizing the surveillance detail . I 'd like to help , if that 's okay with you . Any objections ? None . Much better , thank you . The hard drive , please . It 's been a pleasure . Yeah , I got it . Hey , Red , you got anything ? Uh , yeah , I mean , same as you . I 'm looking at a guy who knows he 's being watched . He 's gonna make a move soon though . Check your watch . He 's waiting for the lunch crowd . - He 's gonna try and get lost . - I 'll be waiting . - So you two seem close . - Yeah , we are . Oh , no . No , no . Ha , ha . I mean , not ... Just as partners . Well , you don 't have to say it like that , like he 's hideous . No , I just broke up with someone and Lincoln 's been my shoulder to cry on . He just got up . What 's he doing ? I 'm guessing that 's not lunch . Units , be advised . Suspect removed some kind of Thermos from the trash . Place HAZMAT and E.O.D. Personnel on standby . Hello . Would you like some money ? - For real ? - Oh , yes . But I need your help giving away more of it . You see , I 've realized that there 's no point being the richest man in the cemetery . All right . This guy 's giving out free money ! Are you seeing this ? Yeah , we see it . What the hell is he up to ? Oh , no . - Colonel Broyles , we have a problem . - What is it ? Tracking software , there 's some sort of malfunction . Jones ' tracking signal is multiplying . We 're seeing 40 or 50 dots and counting . It 's the money . He knows he 's being tracked . - He 's put trackers on the money . - What ? How the hell did he know which signal we 're using ? Damn it . All units move into the plaza . Maintain a visual on the target . Excuse me ! Fringe Division ! Is there any way you can zero in on Jones ? I don 't know which signal is his . I don 't see him . Okay . I think I got him . There 's a new cluster of trackers forming by the fountain . North of the plaza . Damn it . He just disappeared . Colonel Broyles , we lost him . Roger that . All personnel return to Fringe Division . Walter , I know whatever happened today was a setback . There 's more than that . We were severely compromised . Another , please . And more Scotch is gonna change that ? It was my decision , Elizabeth . I knew the risk . I took an immense gamble . And now that man Jones is gone . I don 't think that 's all you 're upset about . You 've gone over the blueprints , haven 't you ? Like Peter asked you to . Yes . I 've tried to see what he 's saying . That the machine is capable of more than one function . That it can return him to his timeline . But I can 't help him . And apparently the other Walter refuses to . Which is ironic given the length that that man went to in the past . That is not your fault . It never was . Well , the outcome is still the same . I couldn 't save our son then and I can 't help him now . Maybe I can . Maybe I can help Peter . These are all the files we got from the hard drive . It seems Mr. Jones was using DOD satellites and ground penetrating radar to gather geological information . So he 's looking for something underground . What 's there ? Minerals ? Oil deposits ? Nothing of obvious value . I 've cross-referenced the subfolders to see which locations they researched . So far I haven 't found any meaningful pattern . - Let me know if you do . - Yes , sir . Do you mind if I take a look at your list of locations ? I don 't mind . Are you really from another timeline ? Yeah , I think so . Cool . Hey , Lincoln , it 's me . We 're uploading Jones ' face recognition profile to the surveillance net now . No , they 're detailed . We got some photos from the interrogation . Okay , well , call me when you do . - Any progress ? - Nothing yet , no . You got something on your mind ? Actually , yeah . That tracker we had on Jones how did he pinpoint the wavelength we were on that quickly ? You think someone from our team told him ? You have a better idea ? I 'm sorry to interrupt . That man , Peter . He says he knows where Jones is going . I think he was looking for a mineral . Amphilicite . It 's found mostly under sizeable deposits of limestone . I overlooked its significance . Because on its own , it has no significance . In its natural state , it 's inert . It 's not reactive like helium . But it can be used as a power source . - How do you know all this ? - Where I 'm from William Bell used a tiny amount to create a battery . - Jones stole the battery . - Battery made out of rock ? With this you get a lot of bang for your buck . - Well , how much bang are we talking ? - Enough to blow a hole in the universe . I 'm guessing Jones must have figured out the same process and possibly how to weaponize it . Which is why he 's looking for it . Any idea where he plans on getting it ? Of all the locations he was studying the one with the most potential for amphilicite is located here . - The Hudson River Valley . - Right . This is the map file they accessed the most on Dr. Fayette 's hard drive . The Mohonk quarry . We contacted the quarry . They haven 't seen any trouble . Which means we may finally be one step ahead of him . Contact Agent Lee . I want that quarry secured immediately . Yes , sir . We 're on the scene . We 've got the main entrance secured and the quarry 's clear . Looks like we beat Jones to it . Soil is undisturbed . No excavation for the last two months at least . Good . Let 's secure the ridge line . Take up positions on the western edge . No one gets in or out . Can you patch me through ? You 're on . There 's an access road above the quarry . It 'd be easy for Jones to outflank you if you don 't guard it . - What access road ? - Just to the north of your position . There 's no road . I 'm looking right at it . Is this the map from Dr. Fayette 's hard drive ? It is . Why ? We 're in the wrong universe . Border tracking is complete . Do it . Ah . Something about the air on this side . It tastes sweeter . Tail to the west , makes weather best and a tail to the east makes weather least . I told Astrid she wouldn 't need an umbrella . Excuse me , Dr. Bishop , you have a visitor . Not now . Can 't you see we 're working on something very important ? Walter ? I 'm not her . You know that , don 't you ? Of course . You 're from the Other Side . I never expected to see you again . I suppose it 's appropriate that a version of our son should bring us together . I came here for Peter . I understand you 're refusing to help him . I 'm sorry you travelled so far . I can 't . I have made my position quite clear . The last time I saw you , you had come to save a boy 's life . Now I 've come to do the same . - Welcome home . - For the record , this was my idea . Later . There 's a chopper waiting . A TAC team is already en route to the location . We 'll meet them there . - How much trouble are you in ? - On a scale of 1 to 10 ? A lot . I 'm sorry . It 'll blow over . It 's not the first time . Thank you . I used honey instead of sugar . I thought ... - But if you would prefer otherwise ... - Actually , I prefer honey . She did too . My Elizabeth . My being here must remind you of so many things . I 'm reminded of something too . Of that night , 26 years ago when you came to me on the Other Side and took Peter away with you . I 'm sorry . L ... I should never have done so . You were trying to save him . He wasn 't mine to save . I had no right . - My Peter had already gone . - You were still a father . I saw how much you loved him . - Your strength ... - Not strength . Hubris . And I 've been punished for it ever since . - By whom ? - By God . By a deity , whatever you want to call it . And I understand . I deserve it . No man should do what I did . You made a mistake . That 's what being a man is . No , it was more than a mistake . I broke universes . I asked for a sign of forgiveness . But I got nothing . There is no absolution for me . Well , I don 't believe that . I forgive you , Walter . I forgave you a long time ago . And if I can God can . We both lost our sons . We 'll never watch them grow up , and fall in love , have babies . But there 's something of them in him . This Peter . I know you feel it too . And if you could just help him ... Walter , he deserves to go back to the people he loves and who love him . I 'm afraid . So is he . We got incoming . - Secure the cargo . - Yes , sir . Hold them off . Let 's go . - Hey . Can I get one ? - You think you 'll need a gun ? Better safe than sorry . Get down ! We are done here . That 's Jones ! Lincoln , I 'm going after Jones . Give me your walkie . - What ? - Now ! Notify Colonel Broyles on the Other Side . Tell him to send a team . Olivia , stop ! Do not follow Jones ! The window will close behind him . If it closes while you are going through it , it will kill you ! Olivia , please , trust me . Olivia ? I 'm here . Are you okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm okay . It seems only hours ago that I asked Peter to be my emissary . I knew that despite the accord that there remained a great deal of distrust and trepidation between our sides . Much of it directed towards me . I also know the truth that a new breed of shapeshifter had infiltrated both our worlds and the only way to defeat them meant working together . Fully combining our resources and our talents . I thought that if you heard this from someone more impartial you 'd see the imperative . That message is no longer necessary . We know who our enemy is now and that in itself is a distinct step forward . Now that we know Jones can cross between sides , we can coordinate . You have our complete support . That 's all good , but you said that only a tiny amount of this processed mineral is enough to tear a hole through a universe . So , what is he planning ? As far as we can tell , he 's recovered at least a hundred pounds of it . She 's right . We 'll have to start trying to game plan what he 's after . How ? We have no information to work from and so far , he has been ahead of us every step . Jones figured we 'd realize he was interested so he crossed over to the Other Side . - We recovered his device . Yes , but for all we know , he has more of them . He is holding all the cards on this . Not all of them . You have me . I know him . And I saw how nervous he was when I was questioning him . If nothing else , I 'm a variable that he didn 't plan for . So yes , we will all have to work together . But somewhere , we stopped him once before . And we can stop him again . You have to tell me everything about David Robert Jones . - The one you encountered . - Of course . Okay , like , every little detail that you remember . All right , I 'm gonna see what rooms are available . - What ? Now ? - We should get started right away . Let 's do this tomorrow . I feel like I haven 't slept in three days . First thing . I promise . That 's fair enough . You know , Peter , before at the quarry , if it weren 't for you ... You 're welcome . All right , I 'll have someone pick you up in the morning . Yeah , yeah , I hear you . Walter . Are you okay ? - May I come inside ? - Yeah . Perhaps something to drink . It 's quite a long walk . Thank you . You should know that your mother was a wonderful woman . Every version of her . She came to see you . I lost the people I loved most , and I imagine you miss them too the people you 've left behind . Yes , I do . I will help you , Peter . I will help you get home . The last 25 years I 've spent thinking about losing my son . I thought I was an expert on loss . Maybe that 's why you are here . Because there are still things that I need to learn . What ? I just spent the last several days with the other Walter . And I was very surprised to learn that he 's not the man that I thought he was . But I am not at all surprised to learn that you are . Is that a good thing ? Yes , Walter . That is a very good thing . You know , I used to live here .

 It 's our job- - create life , And then one day we- - I 'm learning so much hanging out With my uncle and his pals . - What are you doing here ? - I was helping . No , you always go to school first thing , all right ? You wait for them to take attendance , then you skip . You stick around here till 3 : 00 and then I take you home . I 've decided to accept responsibility For my company 's impact on society . Daniel graystone . My company will make no more profit On the holobands or v-world licensing . That 's 60 % of our net . Hold me to it , caprica . I woke up in the virtual world without knowing how I got here . I need to find someone who can show me the way home . If this is a dream , I think it 's too long . I don 't think this is a dream . This is the door , all right ? Come on , you 'll be free . Tamara 's avatar was my last hope of getting her back . Remember , it 's going to seem real , But it 's all virtual . Tamara ! Tamara is really gone ? I 'm sorry , but we can 't save them . Morning . Anybody home ? Hey , what are you doing here ? It 's a school day . Joseph , get up . Joseph ! Joseph , I said get up . Come on , up ! Hey . Where you going ? Taking willie to school . - I 'll take him . - It 's all right , he 's late . No , no , no , no , no . Just hang on a second . I 'll get changed . Dad , it 's okay . I kinda want uncle sam to take me . Go wait . You going to work today ? You going to work today ? Yeah , it 's been a rough couple of weeks . It 's not as bad as it looks . - No ? 'cause it looks pret frakked up . Well , then , why don 't you mind your own business ? This isn 't business . This is family ! You 're a tauron , joseph . You remember that ? No . No , I 'm a caprican . Isn 't that what you always tell me ? You call yourself whatever you want , But first , you be a father . And when you can manage that , Maybe I 'll introduce you to your son . No , I- - Wake up , brother . Come on . * * Um ... Excuse me . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Hey , what the frak ? - Hey ... - I 'm sorry . Watch it . I 'm looking for someone named vesta . I know she 's here . How the frak did you get to the front ? Is there a problem here ? Pushing her way through like that . I need to talk to vesta . Look , I am stuck here and I can 't get out . I heard she can help me get home . Please just let me talk to her . If she can 't help me , I will leave . Okay , we 'll let you talk to her . But we get to watch . Here we go . Here we go . 1,000 . Put your bets down . Let 's go . Okay . 1,000 . Is this all you 're gonna bet ? Okay . Okay , let 's play . Let 's play . Yeah ? We got a taker . Bad dress . Claims she 's stuck . - Okay . 1,500 to you . Grip ... Pull ... Fire . What just happened ? Where did he go ? He de-rezzed . He 's gone . - Gone where ? - Wherever . Home . I want to play . You 're the girl who can 't get out . People have been talking about you . Look , I need to get outside . I need to go home . Can you please help me ? - Take off your band , baby . - I can 't ! She 's not de-rezzing . What 's up with her ? Vesta . Vesta , she didn 't de-rezz . No way ! It 's freaking me out , man ! Hmm , what do we have here ? She got shot , but she 's not de-rezzing . Shh ... Shh , it 's gonna be all right . You and I are gonna help each other . Shh . The pain should zap you out of the program , And you have to re-launch your avatar , but you ... - Can 't . - Don 't have to . She 's a sleeper . It 's supposed to be a myth . Someone who fell aeep with their holoband on And can 't wake up . Somebody would have woken me up by now . Well , maybe you 're unconscious , in a coma . And there must be something wrong with your band Because it should have timed out . But we can hack it . Do a manual disconnect . There 's some kind of price , isn 't there ? What do you want me to do ? Play a little game . That 's all . A game ? Yeah . Help me settle an old score . You play the game , I get you home . She 's not bleeding . I 've never seen anyone heal before . Not in v-world . Clean her up . Get her some new clothes . You 're going now . Yes , hi , this is joseph adama . This is principal andrews calling to check on willie . What ? Well , he 's been out sick . No , no , no . He 's been at school . Well , he 's missed several days in a row now . You 've got to be ... How long ? Since the middle of last week . Oh , my gods . I get that . That 's simple , it 's so- - Put the tray down , take the apron off , and come with me . Why don 't we go out back , joseph ? It 's quieter there . We could talk . Oh , we 've got nothing to talk about ! You frakking bee-known blahx ! That 's nice . A little tauron comes in useful once in a while doesn 't it ? Let 's go . Here 's a little tauron saying for you , brother . I did not lose my son . Oh , really ? Then what are you doing here ? Where are you taking me ? This tunnel leads us to a different section of v-world . It 's a first player game . Once we 're there , we 'll take out a big player . Clean out his in-game bank account Like a ... Like a heist . None of us can come close to pulling this off , Cause this guy 's got security . That 's not going to be a problem for you , okay ? What are you talking about ? You 'll see . Now get ready , here we go . I 'm outside . Wait , is this caprica ? It 's a virtual caprica . A digital recreation , but it 's lawless . Anything goes . Get down ! What is this place ? Welcome to new cap city . So this whole city is like a game ? Yeah . It 's kind of like a different version of caprica city . They update it so it matches . Even the place where the maglev train blew up is here . A maglev train blew up ? How long have you been sleeping ? I don 't know . Okay , what 's the object of the game ? It 's a mystery . It 's almost like figuring out the object of the game Is the object of the game . But we think it 's about getting things that convert into points , Like money , or weapons- - So no one 's ever finished it ? Or won it ? Not yet . There 's this ... Thing . When you die in the game , you 're out , And you can 't ever come back . But with you , I might actually have a shot . Okay , so our target is chiron . He 's a fat cat . Likes to hang in this club on the lower east side . Back booth . Don 't look , just glance . It 's chiron . The horse . Best gamer in the city . You 're going to pull security away , And I 'll grab his avatar , okay ? If he 's the competition , why don 't you just kill him ? His avatar is more useful to us . It gets us into his vault , then we have his money . His virtual money . Well , that 's how you win the game . You think . That 's right . Deal is , you help us win the game , And vesta gets you home . Look , it 's not real , okay ? It is to me . You 're gonna pull security away , And I 'm gonna grab his avatar . Chiron . You forgot to call me . I can forgive you , if you play it right . I 'm sorry , dear . I have no idea who you are . Now get the hell out of here . No , you have to remember . I mean , come on . It was so sweet . You said that I could have anything that I wanted . Don 't you remember what I said ? I said that ... I said- - Aah ! She didn 't get sent back . What 's going on ? She should have de-rezzed already . What ? Come on , come on . It 's okay , all right ? We 're gonna be okay . You did good . You did great . You did great . That just blows my mind . Well , was it worth it ? Did you get what you needed ? Yeah , we totally did . Look , just watch me now , don 't--don 't be scared . You see ? It 's still just me . Anything that 's pure code can be manipulated . Now we can get into his bank vault , Lift his virtual cash , And convert it into points in the game . So we pull that off , and vesta helps you . Look ... I know this must seem really random to you . But this game , it really does mean something to me . It actually allows me to be ... Something . Maybe if you weren 't in here playing this game You could be something out there too . You look goofy . You 're gonna embarrass me . I know that there 's a great spot , just- - This is so boring . Let 's just go home , please ! You 're gonna be so happy when we 're eating it . It 's delicious fish . Come on . You know , we haven 't been here in a long time . Since , uh- - since we came here With your mom and tammy last summer . That was a great day . They were practicall jumping on the line . Do you remember that ? Not really . Listen , willie . If you ever want to talk about anything , About mommy , or tammy . Hey , what are you looking at ? I 'm here for you . You know that , right ? Yeah ... Um , could we just go home , please ? There 's no water . What are you talking about ? This is- - the less water , The closer the fish are to the surface . Everybody knows that . Come on , get your rod . Aw , look at the little tauron dirt-eater . You 've been unreachable for a day . I 'll call you back . And your assistant won 't look me in the eye . I think it 's time you told me what 's going on . The board called an emergency meeting . I 've been trying to figure out who 's behind it . Hmm ... Is it atkinson ? Well , it 's everyone . But , yeah , atkinson , and parker 's gonna be the one Doing the talking . And the others will sit on their hands , Let him go on about the stock price tanking , Your decision to give up the v-world license . So if I don 't come up with answers to the holo-bank crisis They 're going to try to force me to step down From my own company . Do they , uh ... Do you think they have the votes ? Can we just go , please ? I want to go . Just wait a little longer . Don 't you love the fresh air and the beauty out here ? It 's much better than that smoke-filled room at goldie 's . It 's so boring . Can we please go ? I don 't like it here , can we please go ? Looks like it 's gonna be dirt again tonight ! Just , listen--ignore that . They 're idiots . You talking to me ? Who else would I be talking to ? Hey , willie , just ignore them . Willie , put that down . I said , it must be fun to have all that dirt . Really ? Willie , get back here right now ! Willie ! Hey ! No ! - Get him , get him ! - Willie ! Hey ! Hey ! Beat him up ! Hey , come here . Stop it , willie ! No ! Come here ! Did I wake you up ? No , I wasn 't sleeping . Not really . Maybe a few minutes . What 's going on ? I--I think that , uh , I might be losing my company tomorrow . Do you remember when I was pregnant with zoe ? We were living in that flat in cloverdale . And you were taking the bus all over town because that car , That you loved , never worked . It worked . We hadn 't paid the rent for like , three months . You couldn 't afford even upper-level bucs tickets . Ooh , things were really bad . But you had a big , fat meeting with microcap . And you knew nobody wanted to see you in there , But you didn 't care . Someone had ne y fav So you worked on that thing for months . And on the day of the meeting , You fell in the pouring rain getting off the bus . You slipped helping some woman ... Now I remember . With a stroller . And you landed on your ass on the sidewalk . And you - so youn walked into that meeting , In a soaking wet suit , And what turned out to be a broken wrist . And you walked out of there With the deal that would start everything . You can 't change the fact that he went on that show And killed the holoband business . Well , he didn 't stick to the script . But on the flip side , our approval ratings skyrocketed . Exactly . And you think dumping the founder of this company now , In the middle of all this- - You think that 's going to help ? Daniel graystone is the brand . He 's the public face of this corporation , and- - What is that ? Hello , everyone . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . Uh , daniel . I 'd just like to say , We all understand you 're going through an awful lot right now . Holobands are over . Excuse me ? Holobands are over ? The hacked sites are eating up More and more of our market share each quarter . And that 's where the kids are going . Because they 're free . And the next generation coming up , They 'll expect it all to be free . We can 't own it forever . We can either marshal all our resources and funds Towards saving that sinking ship . Or we can look for the next big thing , The next big leap forward That will change the worlds . We either move into the future , Or we die trying to hold on to our past . And this ... This is our future . Fancy machines that cost millions of cubits ? The cost is irrelevant , considering all that it can do . U-87 ? Make the circuit , please . Take a nice look at all these fine folks . Looks a little uncomfortable , doesn 't it ? Do you find yourself wondering what it might be thinking ? Or feeling ? Well , that is the big leap forward , people . Do you sense it ? Beyond artificial intelligence , this is artificial sentience . Do you feel it ? I feel it . Don 't you ? I feel like there is a being inside this machine , Something alive and vital ... And special . And it 's not our imagination . Look at thtest resul . There is a brilliant mind in here . So in terms of practical applications ... Are you seriously asking me about the practical applications Of creating another race that will walk beside us ? Do you not understand the enormity of this creation ? It 's more than a machine . This cylon will become a tireless worker ... Who won 't need to be paid . It won 't retire or get sick . He won 't have rights , Or objections , or complaints . It will do anything and everything we ask of it Without question . U-87 ... Rip your arm off . Go on . Go on ! Looked a little painful , didn 't it ? The desire to anthropomorphize , The need to connect - it 's powerful . And that is why this thing is going to sell . We make them . We own them . They 're real . And the world 's just changed . So ... I believe you were going to take a vote ? Wait . Take a powder . I said blow . This place is a bank ? Where did the security go ? And where 's the vault ? The guards were pure code , not players . They are the security . They scanned the chiron avatar , and it passed . As for the vault , we 're standing on it . Vesta decoded this sequence from a puzzle across town . It was encoded on manhole covers . Really tough to get , but we got it . So I 'll just name off the signs And you step on them as I go , okay ? Okay , just hurry up . All right , you ready ? Yeah . Picon . Caprica . Gemenon . Picon . Tauron . See how this registers as points ? It 's gotta mean something . This has to be the point of the game . Oh , frak . How 'd you do that ? I don 't know . Gods , what are you ? Willie , do your homework . Willie , stop that . Stop it ! What have you been teaching him , sam ? Same things we 've been taught . He 's gonna be a man soon , joseph . You know on tauron , at his age , he already would be . He 's gonna make choices . - I don 't know what to do , sam . - You know what to do , joseph . It 's what you 've been thinking about . It 's what you 've been avoiding . Too tauron for you , maybe . But not for your son . You 're ling him . You are losing him , joseph . Your son needs closure . It 's time to let shannon and tamara go . Look past yourself and perform the rites , brother . You got the votes . You better be right . Welcome to our home . Sati . What 's taking so long ? What are you doing ? Get out of here . I know what this is for . I know what it 's for . Go , go , go , go . You ready ? I 'm ready . You sure moved in fast . Did you get it ? She 's amazing . Stopped the guards , messed with the codes . Like hacking without even hacking . Really ? Interesting . Bring it to me . No . You 're gonna wake me up , get me home , And then you get your money . Yeah ... Well , see , I 've been looking into that , And I can 't . It 's only a month old . It 's yellowing , but you still can Make out the names on the list . What a shame . Tamara adams , 16 years old . 615 olympic street , # 3 , caprica city . Isn 't that you , baby ? So young . Wait , wait , I don 't get it . What--what 's the list ? What 's the list of ? It doesn 't matter . You 're dead , baby . Does that explain why she can do what she did to the guards ? I think it might . You 're not going home , doll face . Don 't worry . We 've got plenty for you to do , baby . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . You need to go to the real world . You need to find my father . You know the address . You heard it . 615 olympic , # 3 . I 'll wait for you in new cap city so you can find me . I can 't go back to the real world , okay- - You could be something there ! Just take off your holoband , okay ? You 're not gonna die here . Just go . What are you ? I 'm awake . Do you have a coin for me , joseph ? I have a coin for my wife , shannon adama . I have a coin for my sister , tamara adama . Will you grant them passage ? They will have passage . Will you let them go ? Yes . Yes . Will you bid them farewell ? Goodbye , shannon . Goodbye , tamara . Goodbye , tamara . Goodbye , mom . Then they will live forever in peace . They will live forever in your hearts . That 's a good one . Hi , can I help you ? Hey , are you , uh , joseph adams ? It 's adama . How can I help you ? Tamara sent me . What are you talking about ? She gave me this address , right ... Okay , look , she 's in the v-world And she can 't get out . If you can just help me- - You saw her ? Yeah , but I think she was just sleeping or something . So if you could just please go wake her up , She really needs that . My daughter 's dead . She died in the maglev attacks . Oh , gods , I--I 'm sorry . You saw her in v-world ? You gotta take me there . You gotta take me to see her . Okay ? Hey ... Hey ! Stop ! Stop ! Hey . Tammy .

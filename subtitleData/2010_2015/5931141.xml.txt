 A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . - Melanie Cross . 1988 . - It 's me . It 's some kind of energy source . That egg needs to go , now . No ! Melanie ! Melanie ! The way to Zenith is blocked ? Oh , it 's more than blocked . It 's gone . - Then we can be a family again . - You 're a liar . You 're working for the guy who held us captive . - Phil ! - Lyle ? Now that we 're back , whatever 's gonna happen , we need Lyle . - The dome 's contracting . - You mean it 's shrinking ? I don 't know why , but it keeps starting and stopping . At least the dome stopped spinning and inverting the atmosphere . That 's why the temperature 's up . - Yeah , but now it 's shrinking . - First that earthquake struck , then it got super cold in here , and now this . You think the dome could be evolving ? - And into what ? - I don 't know . Why is it moving again ? Look , I will figure it out , okay ? In the meantime , spread word to get people to the center of town . Use walkies , go to their houses , just get them there . Now . " To everything there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven . A time to be born , a time to die . A time to plant , a time to pluck that which is planted . " Thank God it 's warming up again . Whatever happens , we 'll get through it together , if that 's what you want . - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . - It can 't be the egg , though , right ? - No , it 's something else . Lyle . You should be resting after everything you 've been through . You hear that ? Huh ? I think we 're all gonna be resting pretty soon . Did Jim tell you about what I saw ? A fresh vision of hell on my way back here . Yeah , he did . You 've been through a lot , which is all the more reason for you to rest . There 's a cot down this hallway , come on . Well , I 'll follow you anywhere , Pauline . Hi . Hey . You 're awake . It 's good to see you too . - How do you feel ? - Better , I think . - It seems warmer . - Cold snap 's over . But ... James , I can tell something else is wrong . I think the dome 's closing in around us . - What ? - We 're gonna figure out how to stop it , and we 'll find out how to get you better . Actually , I think I know where I might be able to get some answers . Go . I 'll be fine . I 'll send someone to sit with you . Come on , around this way , get to the high school , all right ? - You 'll be safe there . - You seeing this ? Yeah , Joe , I see what 's happening with the dome . I 'm just helping people out of their homes . - Let 's regroup back at the school . - Talk to you soon . You should take that . He was your husband . That was my old life . Can you , uh , pass me Pauline 's journal ? Just there . Thanks . The dome has taken so much from all of us . Now this . All that matters is that we survive . And we 're going to . Yeah , we 're gonna give it our damndest . Let 's go . - Oh , my God , it 's close . - Let 's go this way . Let 's go . Did I hear that the dome is contracting ? - Yeah . Saw it with my own eyes . - How fast is it moving ? I 'm still doing the calculations , Jim , so just do what you do best , keep people calm , and ... Hey . Welcome to our new nightmare . Well , that 's stating the obvious . I figured out that at its present rate of stopping and starting , - it won 't be long before the dome ... - Crushes us ? - Here , I 'll take that . - The way every house , tree and square foot of dirt is gonna pile up inside here , we 'll be dead long before the walls get to us . I just can 't believe that . Big Jim threw the egg off the cliff , I 'd say that proves it 's the dome 's power source . No , I mean that the dome would kill us all . Oh , because the dome told you it 's here to protect us , right ? You think I imagined that ? I don 't know , but it 'd be nice to have proof . Look , I appreciate what you do , all right ? You 've helped all of us . But with everything we 've seen , you could admit there 's more going on ... - Okay , I 'm ... - Now 's not the time to debate this . - All right ? - Okay . You 're right . Excuse me . - Let 's help everybody settle in . - Barbie . Julia . - Glad you guys are safe . - We 're not so sure . - What do you mean ? - Hunter here has something he would like to confess . Isn 't that right , Hunter ? Look , when I came back from Zenith with you , I was ... I was secretly working for your Dad . What ? He blackmailed me into spying on you . To find a way to get the egg to Zenith , which I never got to do because Big Jim tossed it . - Look , I am on your side . I swear . - Barbie , it 's true . Hunter stopped that military guy outside the dome from doing experiments on the egg because he knew it was hurting Melanie . There 's gonna be more people hurt if we don 't find a way to stop these walls from shrinking . Barbie , I am really sorry ... You don 't get to talk ! You two go help out . - You going somewhere ? - I said , go help out . Okay . Fine . You good ? I 'll keep an eye on Melanie . - What are you doing ? - Shut up and walk . Let 's go . Ben ? - Hey . - You okay ? It 's over , Norrie . No , it 's not . I just saw the guy who owned the hardware store get his car crushed when the dome smashed into it . - Is he okay ? - He 's dead . Before too long , we 're all gonna be dead too . No , we 're not . Because we 're gonna find a way out of here somehow , someway . We are not gonna die in here . - You know how I know it 's all over ? - How ? The girl who bitched about how she hates this place is now telling me everything is gonna be okay . - Norrie . Let 's go . - Why ? I saw Barbie leading Hunter away from school . - Barbie did not look happy . - Where are they going ? I don 't know , that 's why we have to follow them . Well , whatever they 're up to , Barbie didn 't want us coming along . If it 's Barbie , he 's probably got a plan to stop what 's happening . Don 't you wanna see what he 's up to ? But why do we have to go home ? Maybe one of your paintings shows us how we can stop the dome from contracting . It showed it coming down , pink stars ... Go , have a look , but I could be of more use here . - What , comforting Lyle ? - Is that what this is about ? He 's out of his gourd . And his was soft to begin with . Are you sorry you saved him from drowning ? No . I mean , you wanted him here , and , you know , I did it for you . - That 's a new one . - What do you mean ? That night at the senior dance when Lyle got drunk and dragged me onto the dance floor , you said the last place I should be is anywhere near him . Still took you six months to dump him . But I did , eventually . So let 's go solve this together . Get Don Barbara , now ! - James , what are you doing here ? - It 's about Melanie . - Is she better ? - She tries to act like it - but I 'm still worried . - Who 's Melanie ? - None of your business ... I need to ... - No , no , no . Who is Melanie ? You 've seen her around , Melanie Cross . Melanie Cross ? Wasn 't that a friend of yours ? - Yeah . - Didn 't she go missing 25 years ago ? She died . She died ? Well , how 's she back ? - The dome ... - It 's true . Melanie Cross is alive again . Except this time she 's really sick . When we came back to Chester 's Mill , I had a vision of Melanie in the crater . - She looked odd . - Like she was sick ? Maybe , but when I took her hand , she seemed better . Okay , then what happened ? Then I surfaced in the lake . Please , you have to try to get that vision and paint her . If you paint her healed , then I know she 's not gonna die . James . My visions stopped when the egg left Chester 's Mill . Please try . We have to try everything . James , I would do anything for you , I came back for you . But my visions are gone . I don 't know if I can get them back . Now Melanie 's dying because you screwed up and threw that egg over the cliff . All of this is your fault ! I only did that to try to get you and your mom out . Look at the mess you 've made . Have you found anything to help her yet ? You sound doubtful that I will . Nothing would make me happier , Rebecca . But in the meantime , you 'd like to try what exactly ? A s√©ance ? Is that really what you think I believe ? No . We both want what 's best for her and this town . But while you 're busy asking why the dome would betray us , I 'm asking how do we stop it before it kills us all . Have you ever considered it might take both questions to save us ? Have you ever considered it might not ? Melanie ? Melanie ? Melanie ? Oh , what is going on ? I don 't know . She doesn 't have a fever , so I doubt it 's an infection . Her body 's falling apart . Something must be happening with the egg . And it 's killing her . It could be a bunch of things . Poisoning , autoimmune deficiency ... Is that why her hair is falling out ? Maybe . Any other symptoms ? All I know is when the egg disappeared , her health went downhill . - How 's her blood look ? - Same way she does . Her red blood cells seem to be disintegrating . A transfusion might buy her some time . Yeah , except if we give her the wrong type , it 'll kill her . Well , that 's a risk we have to take . We don 't have the equipment to type blood . - Lima beans . - Come again ? The lectins in Lima beans , they react to the surface of red blood cells . If we mash them up , mix them with the blood , we can determine blood type . Let 's just hope she responds to a transfusion . - Why wouldn 't she ? - Has anyone told you about this girl ? What about her ? It 's a weird story . Come on . I bet Andrea has Lima beans at her house . Junior . Oh , God . She is worse . - We 're doing everything we can . - Me too . Do you know where my mom 's journal is ? It 's in that box . Why ? James ? I can 't believe we lucked out like this . Thank God for hoarders , right ? Right . So you wanna tell me this weird story about Melanie ? Which part ? How she was my high school girlfriend ? Or how she died 25 years ago but is now alive again ? - Excuse me ? - You asked . Sam , people don 't die and come back to life . I mean , they can be medically resuscitated , but not after two decades . And yet here she is . And that is the girl I knew . Your sister faked her own death . I don 't know , maybe Melanie somehow ... Rebecca , I saw her die . And I know death when I see it . Why the stupid grin , Lyle ? I see you have an eye now for your mother 's artwork . The real question is why she ever had eyes for you . Your mother saw that she needed someone to nurture her gifts , - not doubt them . - And you 're that someone ? Well , it wasn 't your dad . She sent me those postcards for the last nine years . You know why ? Because she trusted me to understand them . You want me to do the same thing for you ? Why ? To make up for hitting you with a fire poker , and for stealing the journal . Okay . Find something in here that might help Melanie . That 's you and Sam , my mom , and Melanie , right ? On the way to the crater , 25 years ago . That 's the night Melanie died . That 's not gonna happen again . If only you knew what I know . - Junior , we 're all gonna die inside this . - Just focus on the drawings . I 'm not seeing anything . Are you sure ? You didn 't paint a vision of a new tunnel ? Or a hole in the dome somewhere ? If I had , we would have found it by now . Listen , we are not gonna get crushed in this dome because I screwed up and threw that egg over . There 's gotta be something here . You okay ? Yeah . Just glad I 'm the right blood type . All right . Give me a shout if you need anything . Thanks . What 's going on ? Oh , we 're transfusing you . I 'm gonna find out why you 're sick . Not knowing makes you mad , huh ? A little . My mom used to kiss my forehead when she took my temperature . Did your mom do that ? I don 't remember . She died when I was 8 . I 'm sorry . I wanted a reason . Someone to tell me why she was taken from me . Maybe some questions have no answers . You sound like Julia . Is that such a bad thing ? There 's a better thing , Melanie . Knowing . People have always wondered about the world . Why the sun rises and sets . Why spring turns to summer and then autumn . Why loved ones get sick . How to make them better . You know , knowing the answers doesn 't take away the wonder . It actually makes it more amazing . Then tell me why I 'm dying . Because I 'm not just sick , am I ? I 'm dying . - Listen ... - All that matters , is the first time I died I was all alone . Now I have you and Julia , and my brother . It was worth coming back , just for that . It 's stopping again . Hey , your plan worked . We need the egg back , now ! Son , you know I 'd do anything to help . But I can 't make that happen . All right , well , then your son and your daughter die in here ! Melanie disappeared years ago . No . She 's alive . In here . With us . No , that can 't be possible . Joe ! Norrie . Get your asses out here . How 'd you know we were following you ? Because stealth is not your strong suit . Hey . Listen , I need to convince my dad about Melanie , okay ? So do you have any photos , or ? Vlog . Yeah . Show him . How do you like it so far ? - Everyone 's so sad . - Yeah . Is there something I can do to help ? That 's enough . How ? Because that egg brought her back . Without that here in Chester 's Mill , she dies , and all of us die too . It 's starting again . Barbie , he isn 't getting it . Tell him it 's more than just a thing . It 's alive somehow . It knows us . Barbie , the egg is upset being out there . If he gives it back , - this could be our way out . - Okay , I got ... Get out of here . Go . Is this smart ? He could bring his whole army through with him . We take that risk , or we get crushed to death in here . Tell him to go through the red door of that root cellar at his house . Be careful . The lake 's where we came through from Zenith . Someone should be there when he shows up . Look , it 's stopping . - You 're not going anywhere . - Joe and I 'll go . Fine . You go get a walkie , then head on out to the lake . But actually hide this time , all right ? Stay out of sight . When my dad shows up , you radio me . - Go . - Will do . Think your dad will really go get that egg ? The dome will let us know . Julia . Hey . The dome stopped contracting . - What ? - I met with my dad , and I convinced him to get that egg back to us . Literally , as soon as he left , the walls just stopped shrinking . Maybe the dome must have wanted the egg back too . When it saw your dad would make that happen , it gave us a sign . I can 't say for sure , but I don 't know how else to explain it . Guys ? Come here , quick . Melanie . - Hi . - Hey . How are you feeling ? Like myself again . The transfusion worked . That , and we 're getting that egg back . It 's why I 'm getting better . I guess when it 's okay , you 're okay . Listen , the transfusion only buys us some time . She 's still very sick . Whatever it is , she 's a hell of a lot better right now than she was . All right ? That 's all that matters to me . Hello ? Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? All the batteries in these walkies are dead . The ones over here are too . Barbie , can you read me ? Yeah , Norrie , I read you . Great , just checking . We 'll radio you - when your dad gets here . - Roger that . All right , we got one . We 're good to go . We sure are . - What is that ? - It 's a gun . Yes , I 'm aware it 's a gun . What are you doing with it ? We 're taking it with us . No , you 're gonna put that down . Look , relax , I checked . It 's not even loaded . Yeah , and it 's not going to be . You 're gonna put it back , find the key , and lock it the hell up . - Norrie ... - Joe , the one and only time you have ever held a gun , you almost shot Melanie in the face . - In other words , I didn 't . - It 's not coming . Barbie thinks his dad could be dangerous . Hunter does too . We need it for protection in case he tries anything when he gets here . You want protection ? Just get behind me . Plus , if Don Barbara does show up with the egg , it 's gonna be because he wants to help us , not hurt us . - Let 's go . - All right . Not gonna end this way . Not after all we 've been through . Not after the dome brought you back to me . I wish I could see something to paint . Anything to get us out of here . What if I can help ? You can 't fix me . It 's like I 'm drowning . I 'm looking for shore , and all I see is darkness . Okay , you can 't see , but can you feel ? Yes . I feel . I feel alone . Ashamed . Of me ? No , of me . Ashamed for letting Melanie die all those years ago . Ashamed for losing faith in you . Ashamed of leaving my family . No , you didn 't lose faith . I 'm the one who lost faith . I didn 't understand your gifts , or that the dome had chosen us . Now I do . How can you be sure ? Junior was chosen to bring you back to me . The dome chose to save me before I could hang myself . And it healed all those people , as soon as it saw what I was willing to sacrifice . You were chosen to lead Chester 's Mill . And you were chosen to show me the way . - Look at that . What do you see ? - Jim . - What do you see ? - A blank canvas . You know what I see ? A fresh start . So you forgive me ? Yeah , I forgive you . We both made some pretty big mistakes . How could you know those paintings would come to life ? They were so crazy . Yeah , they were . No , that 's the obelisk in Zenith . That doesn 't have anything to do with Melanie . There 's gotta be something in here that shows Melanie healthy . Here , let me try and find something . Is that me and Melanie ? She looks fine in that one . Uh-uh . No , the way I see it , that 's your mother and me , entering heaven together . Just like I always hoped . Don 't even say that . You asked . Sir , I know he 's your son , but you need to rethink this . My instincts have gotten us all this far . You need to trust me , Malick . But you can 't even touch it . It 's injured anyone that 's even gotten near it . Joe , any sign of my dad yet ? Not him , not the egg , nothing . All right , we 'll give it a little longer . When you saw him , did he remember me ? Yeah . A father doesn 't forget his daughter . I remember his face . It was the day I met you . He seemed sad , like he already knew . He already knew what ? That if we met , we wouldn 't wanna say goodbye . Well , this time we won 't have to . Mr. Barbara , no . Time to do what I need to do . What the hell ? Sir , that needs to remain here . Tell them to back off , Malick . I take orders , just like you . Melanie ? What 's happening to me ? Stay calm . Sam ! I thought he promised to help . All right , hang in there , Melanie . Sam ! - What happened ? - She was having trouble breathing . She just passed out . I know we 've screwed up . Over and over again . But even with everything that 's happened , I still choose to believe you 're trying to protect us . I think that when you stopped moving , that was your way of giving all of us another chance , so I need to ask you for one more thing . Please help Melanie . She deserves to live . Everyone in here does . You said that I was chosen . Well , if I was , then that has to be for something , so if someone has to die , then let it be me . Just please don 't take any more of them . Sorry . How 's it going ? It started working . A vision came through . - You painted two ? - No , just one . Does it show me how to save the town ? No , it 's more what Junior wanted . You need to keep painting , then . I can 't . What 's it mean ? I 'm not sure , but I think it tells us how to save Melanie . The eight hands are to heal her ? Now I know why I wanted Sam and Lyle to come back with me . The eight hands . Four old , four new , working together to make her well again . But Angie 's dead , so there 's only seven . Who 's the eighth ? I don 't know . Doesn 't matter . The dome knows . Besides , if you painted it , it must be true . Where do we start ? - The school . - All right , let 's go . That 's the first time I 've seen you sit still . How 's Melanie ? She 's back to the way she was . I just don 't get it , Sam . Why the transfusion didn 't work ? Why she got better , why she got sick again . Most of all , who she even is . Her coming back after all these years contradicts every law of physics , biology . That 's everything that I have ever believed in . Science doesn 't have every answer . Well , I just can 't give up like you and Julia . It 's not giving up . It 's letting go . There 's a difference . Which is ? Knowing there are things you don 't know and still being okay with it . Come on . What do you say you and I go face this uncertainty together ? Guess that 's an answer I 'll have to accept , right ? - Where 's Melanie ? - Why ? I painted a vision . It may show us how to save her . - You 're in on this ? - All that matters is to believe my wife . If we save Melanie , we can save this town . Well , we better hurry . The dome is closing in again . This time even faster . So he didn 't show up at the lake . No . Pauline thinks there 's a way to heal Melanie . - Without Don bringing the egg ? - Pauline wants us all together , the old and new hands . Can I go ? You 've come this far . - You ready to go ? - Yeah . Just tell us when . You coming too ? I wasn 't sure anything this unscientific would interest you . Well , if this is a way to heal Melanie , I wanna see it . Maybe we can both be right , Julia . Is it true ? The dome 's contracting faster now ? That 's exactly why we need to hurry . So our dad didn 't do what he promised . All that matters is what I promise . We 're gonna make you better . You sure this 'll help her ? I 'm only sure that we have to try . No matter what happens today , I love you , James . Never forget that . What do you mean ? Years ago , I left you . It was a mistake . - It 's not gonna happen again . - I forgive you , Mom , but why are you saying this ? - Everything okay here ? - We 're fine . Let 's get ready to head out . And , James , please try to forgive him . What the hell 's he doing here ? You know he 's one of the original four . It 's a great day to do something wonderful . Stay away from my family . When I came back to Chester 's Mill , I had a dream of seeing Melanie in the center . Put her there . Hold on . Put her here . Hey . You 're gonna be fine . - So , what now ? - I 'm not exactly sure . - The painting was more symbolic . - She 's barely breathing . Barbie , let her do her thing . All hands , surround her . Everyone kneel down . Junior , you grab her hand . Everyone else , get ready to lay a hand on her . Okay , now . Nothing 's happening . Are we doing something wrong ? Jim , maybe you 're right . We don 't have enough without Angie . - We have to heal her . - I 'm sorry . I 'm trying . - Hey , what 's happening to her ? - She 's seizing . We can 't do it , not without all the eight hands . - We only have seven . - Wait , we do have eight . Melanie counts as two hands . The girl she was in the past and the girl she is now . Replacing Angie ? She can 't be two people at once . No , not two people . The same person in two different times , past and present . Quantum physics says ... - Object can be in two places at once . - Exactly . So if Melanie is the bridge between past and present , - the 7th and 8th hand ... - Someone take her other hand . James , you 're the hand from the present . Sam , you dated her 25 years ago . You do it . Everyone else , lay a hand on her again . - Is it working ? - Her seizures stopped . Don 't let go . Hey . Hey . - What the hell is happening ? - Steady , Lyle . It 's okay . It 's okay , Lyle . She 's waking . Melanie , are you okay ? She looks better than okay to me . Pauline . It 's so beautiful . - Pauline . - Hey . Your hand . Give me your hand . - Hold on to her . - I 'm trying . Don 't let her go . - Hold on ! - Barbie . Don 't let go . Melanie ! - Where did she go ? - I don 't know . - We have to go after her . - No , no , no . - We don 't know where that goes . - You jumped down not knowing ... Yeah , Phil jumped and died instantly . - Same thing could happen here . - He 's right . We gotta be smart about this . - Figure it out first . - Is this the way you painted it ? I thought it showed her healed , but ... Wait , Pauline . Pauline . In my dream , I saw Melanie disappear . - I didn 't know it meant that . - Maybe she 's alive . - You saw what happened . It 's my fault . - No one 's blaming you . You tried to help . I love you . I love you too . You know why ? Because she 's supposed to be with me , Jim . Always has been , supposed to be with me . The red paint . It was my blood . Wait . What do you mean ? The dome wanted me to sacrifice ... So that she and I could be in heaven together . Forever , us . Us . You ... You ... You caught me . Thank you , Jim . Thank you . Pauline . Why ? Why ?

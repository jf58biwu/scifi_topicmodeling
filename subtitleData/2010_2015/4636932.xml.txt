 A possible Red Flag prisoner 's in our office . Cameron said that he and Nina had him subdued and now they 're bringing him here . I thought Sullivan wanted an " approach and evaluate , " see if the man is an Alpha or any Red Flag connections . Well , clearly things went another way . So we still don 't know what his ability is ? No . It 's a good thing we got this thing up and running . 1968-16-7 . That 's not your birthday , is it ? Super Bowl III . Jets beat the Colts 16 to seven . Yeah , but you couldn 't have been old enough to have been there . I was six months old . I even have a photo of my dad holding me while he was watching the game so that makes me ... A Jets fan for life , baby . We 're coming . You see what we did last year , right ? Yeah , that 's football , right , Bill ? Uh , yeah . Football . Anyway , so we got bulletproof polarized glass , we got industrial grade surge suppressors , fire retardant foam . And the best part is we got an emergency lockdown for the whole office . The windows , the doors , everything , shut . Now if only we can get the DOD to buy us a new car . Can they do that ? Oh , gosh , Bill , I ... I don 't know . I 've allowed this to go so far beyond what I envisioned for all of us . Doc , you got to get over that . We 're no longer just your patients . We 're a government asset . What 's the expression , " Dance with the devil in the pale moonlight ? " Yeah , well , you got to go with the flow , right ? Isn 't that what you always tell me ? Look , ever since that mess with Jonas Englin I 've lost my ability . I 'm here , right ? I 'm good with it . You 're good with it . So ... No , I 'm not all that good with it . It 's not who you are . And the DOD isn 't happy with it either . Actually I 'm trying to figure out a way to get your ability back . I know you 're a fine investigator , Bill , but as far as the government 's concerned we are a group of Alphas . You 're not an Alpha and you 're still here , right ? Besides , Doc ... Huh ? Jeannie and I are thinking about renovating the kitchen so please keep those checks coming . This isn 't going to work . This isn 't going to work . They ignored my checklist . I made a detailed list . Sleep gas dispensers and telepathy blockers and some automated gun turrets . Gary , those things don 't exist . Yeah , I liked the old Bill better . You 'd take things seriously and your veins would pop out when things weren 't right and this isn 't right . Why aren 't your veins popping out anymore ? I don 't have to worry about that anymore . Yeah , why are you still here then ? You 're not even an Alpha anymore . If I wasn 't here , you 'd miss me , right ? You being gone and you being different are the same thing . Did you give me a hug today ? Give me a hug . Whatever , Bill . Whatever . - Gary . Ow . Ow ! That 's cool . I got it . Hello ? Are you hearing me ? What was that noise ? Check over ... Bill , ten-four . Uh , Rachel , this is not a police radio . You can speak normally . Okay . I hear them . They 're in the elevator with Dr. Kern . All right . Thanks . Let 's go . Sorry about this . Well , were you able to confirm any Red Flag connection ? No , we barely sat down before he got suspicious . What about an Alpha ability ? I tried to push him , but it just didn 't work . Well , I want to run some MRIs first . Then we can put him in the holding cell . Let 's move fast before he wakes up . Doc , you okay ? Yeah . It 's just , uh ... Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Please don 't wake him up . Relax , Rachel . You know , I still have my gun . And I am a better shot when I 'm not all amped up . You know , Bill , I ... I was thinking if I dosed you with a mixture of adrenaline and steroids , we might be able to jump-start your ability . Doc , I am not interested . All that got me was issues , right ? Marriage issues , and work issues , and ... No , I understand your concerns . Like who needs it ? We might . We all have our issues , but we 're learning how to control them . Yeah , well , I 'm all in control now . Thank you very much . All right , let 's see what we have here . Paperwork ? Already ? God , you 're so motivated . I used to ignore it and pretend it would go away , but it never did . Cream , no sugar , right ? I pay attention . I wonder what tipped Kern off to us . Well , the guy 's an obstetrician , he sees happy couples all the time . Obviously didn 't see that in us . What , we don 't buy the whole happy couple thing ? No , look , I 'm not saying that . Rosen thinks that it 's a bad idea , you and me . What do you mean ? You told him ? Well , he 's our shrink . Or is it because , uh ... Because I 'm divorced and in AA ? Maybe ... Maybe it 's because I have a kid . We work together . It would be unprofessional . No , we do things in this job all the time that are unprofessional and you know that . But that 's not it . He thinks that I 'd be bad for you and he might be right . Cam , I 've screwed up every relationship I 've ever had . Me , too . So we 're perfect for each other ? Hey , guys , um , Doc found something . We got a meeting . Yeah , we 're on our way . How can Kern be blind ? Because he has no optic nerve . The MRI revealed something , uh ... Well , pretty interesting . It 's as if they 've never developed . So even if his eyes were functioning properly as they appear to be , no visual data would ever reach his brain . Which is why I couldn 't push him . He couldn 't see me . Look , when things got ugly , that guy dodged around his desk and he ran straight for the door . There is no way he 's blind . Well , unless he 's an Alpha , which I have some ideas about . But I need to run a few more tests . So we 're talking about a blind Alpha that 's a baby doc , and a member of Red Flag . Where 's my phone ? Who 's got my phone ? Bill ? Bill ? Bill ? Where 's my ... Gary , I 've been here the whole time . What are you talking about ? Yeah , where 'd you put my phone ? Gary , I 've been here the whole time . I don 't have your phone . Gary , your phone is right here . Oh . Well , that 's not okay . People shouldn 't be touching my phone . It was a gift . It 's special . Okay , and it 's back in your hands . It 's fine . Yeah , no , it 's not . 'Cause it 's open to data files and those are private . Hey , yes , Gary 's phone is private . Please , no one is to touch it unless they have Gary 's permission , all right ? Yeah , the answer is no . All right , the reason Dr. Kern is here is that DOD suspects that he 's been doing some sort of research and they 're hoping that we can figure out why . And , more to the point , a radicalized Alpha who is also an obstetrician ... That 's , uh ... That 's a disturbing thought , to say the least . Well , we cleaned out his office . Uh , hard drive , cell phone , patient files . Meds , vitamins , blood samples ... Which , Rachel , you 'll take a look at . Everything that could be tacked down . - That 's great . And , Gary , you will look into the cell phone and computer transmissions . That 's just data mining . People without abilities can data mine . Well , you know , we all can 't do that . I can 't do it , Gary . Neither can I. We all know that you are so much more than your abilities , Gary . You have very many talents . I know , I 'm amazing . My lucky day . Gary ? Hello ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Did you call me ? I 'm working . Do not disturb . That 's my IM chat status . I should get a sign . Hey , Gary , were you just there by my office ? Rachel , you 're not making sense . I told you , I 'm working . I work in my office . Bill , could you remove the mouth strap ? You sure ? Yes , I have the test results I need . I just would like to speak with him . Okay , whatever . Let me tell you something . Happiness is a warm gun and mine is a SIG 226 . You got me ? I want my lawyer . Yeah , and I want a Reuben sandwich . I 'll have my lawyer pick you up one . Well , unfortunately , Dr. Kern , you 're being detained because of suspected involvement with a terrorist organization . The only organization I belong to is the AMA . So , what , Alphas , ability , Red Flag , that means nothing to you ? Bill , will you take the cuffs off , stand him up , and have him face the glass ? Turn around slowly . Keep your arms up . And now face the wall , please . What is this , a cavity check ? That 's just as I thought . Sonar , echo location . What , like a bat ? Or a dolphin . You can sit down now . Very interesting . You have no optic nerves . However , the audio processing capabilities of your brain , your voice box , chambers in your sinus passages , they 're all significantly enhanced . You 're an Alpha , but , of course , you already know that . This isn 't going to end well . Is that a threat ? Hey , Clay . Rosen and I are going to keep working with Kern and Rachel 's nosing around through what we found in his office . Rosen thinks he 's probably said about as much as he 's going to , so why don 't you come scoop him up ? All right . What , two hours ? Maximum ? All right . Have a safe flight . Doc , can we talk ? I 'm a bit busy , Cameron . Can it wait ? No , it won 't take long . Look , I just wanted to say , um , me and Nina ... If you could just give us a little space , let us figure some things out for ourselves . I 'm only trying to look out for the both of you . Well , I get that , but we 're adults . We get to make our own mistakes , so , please , just let it go . I 'd like to , but as your psychiatrist and your employer I don 't think I can do that . And I don 't think you 're in a place to make that decision . Am I interrupting ? I 'm always interrupting . I 'm sorry , but I found something in the items from Kern 's lab . It 's important . Here , look at these . " Building blocks for a better baby . " Yeah , they 're vitamins , for pregnant women . I decided to break one open and take a look inside . You know , really take a look . Rachel , what did you find ? DNA . Active human DNA inside the vitamins . Active human DNA introduced into a developing fetus could cause multiple birth defects , severe mutations . Yeah , that 's what I was worried about . Hold on a second . I smell blood . In the hallway . Nina . It just started bleeding . I haven 't had one of these since I was a kid . Oh , gosh , look up . No , it ... It 's okay . Headache or anything ? It was just a few broken capillaries . Nothing serious , but were you picking ? I don 't pick . Here , take this . You 'll be fine , just clean it up , okay ? Okay , got it . Are you aware you have mitral valve prolapse ? Three millimeters of displacement . Oh , you just did an ultrasound of my chest . You should get that looked at . Well , I have a heart exam twice a year . I 'm monitoring it . Thank you for your concern , though . Like you , I took an oath . Do no harm . Oh . I may be an Alpha , but I 'm a doctor first . I hope you 'll keep that in mind . No harm ? What kind of doctor gives active human DNA to pregnant women ? Someone who cares about the future . Whose future ? You 're aware of Renestrin ? A new drug that allegedly prevents birth defects . But what it really does is interferes with the fetal development of more evolved children . What you 're really saying is it prevents babies from being born as Alphas . Consider my special vitamins the counter agent . Are you planning to distribute your counter agent all by yourself ? Can any of your team read minds ? Well , I guess there are some questions that aren 't meant to be answered . Dr. Rosen , I know what 's going to happen next . Men with guns will whisk me away to some government facility . That would be a tragic , tragic error . Well , I 'm afraid the real tragedy is you choosing to join a terrorist organization . Red Flag isn 't as monolithic as you think it is . Oh , regardless of its scope , you and your friends tried to assassinate me . Fringe elements , radicals , not representative of the mainstream . You know , it 's amazing how often people use that term , fringe elements ? Occurs to me that the IRA , PLO , KKK , all fringe elements . Whose very existence depends upon the support of their mainstream fellow travelers . I 've read your field reports , doctor . You advocate a future where Alphas and normal humans cooperate for the common good . That 's the future I want . We should be working together . Comparing notes . You 're inviting me to join Red Flag ? I 'm afraid I don 't meet their entry requirements . I see a time coming soon where the unenhanced will be able to join our cause . That 's where you belong . Dr. Kern , if you 're willing to disclose what exactly it is you 're up to , I 'm willing to intervene on your behalf . Impasse . I 'm disappointed for you , doctor . Well , I 'm not the one going to Binghamton . What makes you think I am ? Bill ? Hicks ? Come on , guys . This better not be a joke . This guy 's holding out on us . Any ideas how we break him down ? He 's sonic guy , right ? Yeah . Maybe it 's time we pull out the Captain and Tennille 's Muskrat Love . Sonic warfare . Yeah , it 's been known to work . Just remember , anything we force him to listen to , we 've got to hear it as well . Trust me , they used the same trick on detainees in Bagram . I still feel sick every time I hear Copacabana . I love that song . Oh , come on . I do . It 's one of my favorites . You hear that ? Gary screwing with the computers again ? I can 't get in the system . It seems like he 's done some sort of keypad retrieval . Have you seen Rachel ? No , not lately . She 's not in her office and no one 's seen her for a half hour . Yeah , why don 't you scream for her ? Yeah , I did , okay ? She 's gone . - Rachel ! - Rachel ! Rachel , if you can hear us , say something . Nothing , nothing . There 's something wrong with the security camera footage . Gary , Gary , Gary , come here , come here . Show me what you 're looking at . Pull it up on the monitor , please . Okay , it 's glitchy . Give me Rachel 's office an hour ago . Something 's making it glitch . There . Okay . Okay , there she is . In her office going over the stuff from Kern . Can you fast forward ? Yeah . It 's glitchy , though , it 's glitchy , glitchy . Okay , wait , wait . Here , here . Then she leaves . Oh , no , wait , wait . I found her . 20 minutes ago . There . There . Hicks ! Nina ! Gary , stay here . This way . Rachel ! Rachel ! Rachel , where are you ? This is the last place she was seen on camera , right ? Yeah . Rachel ! Oh , my God . What ? Bill , over here . It 's blood . I 've got blood here , too . Yeah , these look like drag marks , right ? Starting over there . No , they start here . Well , she couldn 't have just evaporated . What the hell ? Rachel , where are you ? Rachel ! Hey , take a look at this . Was this like this when we moved in ? What are you doing ? Where 's Rachel ? Rachel ? Which one 's Rachel ? The tall one or ... The other woman . Well , I never met her . You can do more with your sonar than just find things . I 'm chained to a table . I can 't run around abducting people with my voice . Besides , my hearing is quite good . The number of heartbeats on this floor hasn 't changed since I walked in . How many are you hearing ? Do we really have to play this ridiculous game ? There are eight . There have always been eight . Yours , mine , and the six members of your team , I assume . We haven 't been properly introduced . Dr. Kern , there are only six of us . That includes Rachel and myself , plus you , that 's seven . What ? Have things ... Have things gone missing around your office ? Strange sounds ? Computers turning on randomly ? People sensing someone nearby without ever seeing anyone ? You have an unwelcome guest . What are you saying ? That Rachel 's been kidnapped ? And that person is still here in the building ? Let me solve your problem . Let me help you or we 're all dead . Why should I believe anything you say ? Don 't , don 't . But one member of your team is down already . Ignore me , things will only get worse . Let me out before it 's too late ! Let me out ! You need to let me out ! I 'm the only one who can keep us alive . Don 't need to hear that . I don 't trust that guy for a second . I searched the entire offices again and still no Rachel . Now we 've got nothing to go on except what Kern is saying . I can 't wait for Clay to show up and get this guy out of here . Not until we find Rachel . Yeah , I think we should at least consider what Kern is saying . An intruder would certainly explain some of the strange things that have been happening here . Right , Doc , earlier today I thought I was imagining something , right ? I felt that someone was watching me . I turned around and there was no one there . Exactly , Bill . That is called proprioception . It 's one of the ways we have of processing the millions bits of information in our environment around us . It 's like you said , you find yourself in a room full of people , you sense something , you feel compelled to turn around and they 're looking right at you . That 's our proprioception at work . So our proprioception says someone 's here , but our eyes say there isn 't . Yes , well , unlike Rachel , when we 're looking for something we rely on our vision . But vision can be deceptive . How many dots do you see ? Two . All right , now , hold this with your right hand . All right . Close your left eye . Look at this dot and move the paper slowly towards you . One of the dots just disappeared . Into your blind spot . You 've all heard of one . We all have one . It 's a hole or gap in our visual landscape , which exists because of the way our brains are wired . We might be dealing with an Alpha who can exploit this phenomenon . Let 's say that there is an Alpha here , right , that does it . How do they get into that gap ? Bill , I don 't know . They might be able to send a signal that swells the optic nerves thereby expanding collectively the blind spot and move into it so nobody can see them . I still don 't buy it . I mean , there 's cameras everywhere . Exactly . An Alpha might be able to mess with our brains , but how does he get past the cameras ? The cameras are glitched . Someone 's made them glitchy . There 's dropped frames and time lapses . Is it enough to get around without being seen ? Yeah . Yeah . But it 's only our cameras . It 's only the cameras inside this building . Yeah , the ... The camera across the street looks into this building every 15 minutes and that 's why I won 't go to the bathroom three minutes after , or at 18 or 33 ... Gary . Gary . ... or 48 . Yeah . Okay , watch this . Wait , who 's the ... Hicks , behind you ! Where 'd she go ? I can 't see her ! What happened ? Ah . I never even saw her . This isn 't good . It 's a lot of blood . It 's okay . It 's okay . We 'll get you to the ER . Get a pressure bandage on that right away . She 's activating the blast door ! Take him to the lab . The password 's been changed . Well , the phones aren 't working either . Or the internet . Yeah , and Rachel 's missing , Hicks is on the DL . Even if Clay gets here in time , he couldn 't get in . Don 't worry about that now . Maybe Gary can override the lock system . All right . That 's worth a try . Ah ! Stupid security glass . Gary ? Gary , what are you doing ? I 'm using two chairs . Gary , no . I tried one chair and now I 'm using ... Gary . Gary ! No , Dr. Rosen , I used one chair . I 'm speaking to you . Yeah , let me use the chair . I need your help . Will you come with me ? I am helping . Come with me , please . Oh . It won 't kill you , but no bouncing off the ceiling for a few days , okay ? Glad someone paid attention during the first aid class Harken made us take . Hey , come on , come on , we got to find Rachel . I 'll get Rosen to give you some pain pills . Addict . Sorry . Okay . Come on . I 'm not good for you . I don 't care . That witch took my phone . What witch ? The witch . That 's a word my mom uses when she 's angry . She uses another word , too . She took Rachel and she took my phone . Bitch got my gun . That sounded like shots . That sounded like my gun . Bulletproof glass . Excellent idea . Oh , it 's cracking . Gary . Do you have my phone ? Not so close . Gary , Gary , I need you to see if you can get the computer systems back online . Don 't leave his side . Got it . Cameron , Rachel . I 'm on it . This is definitely my gun . Hey , hey , where is she ? Where 's blind spot girl ? You mean the person who just tried to shoot me ? Or free you . I say day , you say night . We 're never going to find common ground like this . Yeah , you want common ground ? Why don 't you start with her name ? Griffin . Her name is Griffin . But I suspect it 's a nom de guerre . Red Flag considers her an unsanctioned variable . What exactly does that mean ? Someone who sells their services to the highest bidder , but supports no cause , has no allegiance . A person should believe in something , don 't you think ? You two I respect , even though you 're wrong , at least you 're loyal to a cause greater than yourselves . So you 're saying that she 's just a mercenary doing anything for money ? My ability can be extremely useful in finding her , not to mention your missing compatriot , Rachel ... Rachel , yes . I don 't think so . And then you guys waltz out of here laughing your asses off . Good try . Does it look like I 'm laughing ? Griffin 's after me . She 'll do whatever it takes to get me . Including killing all of you . Well , look , either you 're a target or you 're an accomplice . But either way you 're staying right where you are , until we hand you over to Clay . Rachel ! The blast door , I can 't get it open . Why do we always have to fight other people with abilities ? It 's annoying . I guess I 'm not meant to be normal , huh ? I 'm sorry , Bill . I had hoped we 'd have more time to talk , but , uh ... You know , weigh the pros and cons and let you have more time to make your own decision about this . When you used to talk to me like this , it used to make me cranky . Well , I 'm afraid it will again . Ah . So the decision has been made for me . How long does it take ? It should take effect immediately . Let 's give this sucker a test drive . Come on , Bill . I can do this . I can do this . You should be able to by now . The drug should be checking in . I got it . Doc , it 's not happening . Look , I 'm not sweating , right ? My heart rate feels normal . I 'm not feeling any rush ... Do you want to ? ... or rage . Of course I want to . No , that 's not what I 'm asking . What are you saying ? You think it 's in my head ? Well , your ability to do this has always been linked to an ... To an emotional state of yours . You can 't have one without the other . We are not going to die because I can 't get this up . Well , that should make you angry . All right , Bill , stop , stop , stop . Stop . You can 't do this , all right ? It 's okay . Now we can 't find Rachel and I think we 're going about this the wrong way . I think we need to go on the offensive . Are you sure this is going to work ? Yes ! Break up the patterns . The more abstract the background , the harder it should be for Griffin to blend in . It 's messy . I know , Gary , but we 'll clean it up . Come on , Gary , move ! Gary , move , come on ! I am . I am . Stay right here by yourself . Sit down by that pillar . Okay , the camera 's on . Bill , be careful ! You bleeding again ? - Over here ! No , I 'm fine . Well , get Rosen to look at it , okay ? Over here . Look behind you . She 's running . There ! There ! The footprints ! In the creamer ! Gary , get to your office , lock the door ! She 's in the MRI room ! Nina , no ! Nina , get back here ! Where is she ? Where 'd she go ? It 's a trap . Bill , get that door . Oh , my God , Gary ! Gary ! Damn it ! She 's got us . Gary ! Gary ! Gary ! - Gary , get out of there ! - It 's okay . - Move ! Gary ! Okay . Son of a bitch ! Gary ! DCIS , don 't move . Stop hiding . Come out . Open up , Gary . Stop hiding . Okay , you 're only making it worse for yourself . You have to stop hiding . DCIS . You 're under arrest . Gary , get out of there . Run to your office . Stop hiding . DCIS . You 're under arrest now . Please , stop . You have to stop . Please , stop . Please , no , no , no . - Hey ! Oh . Oh , that felt so good . Gary , are you okay ? So , how do you do this ? Fool our brains so we can 't see you ? I 've never given it much thought . Why don 't you cut me loose so we can figure it out together ? I can give you a demonstration if you like . I didn 't think so . Kern referred to you as an unsanctioned variable . Hmm . I prefer ronin . Sounds cooler . Well , I 've been following him for two weeks and then you lot scooped him up so thanks for that . Why don 't you just let me take Kern and leave ? It 's the easiest solution to your problem . Well , that 's interesting . He says we should release him to stop you . That you are our problem . And you don 't know who to believe , huh ? You seen your walls lately ? What are you talking about ? The cracks ? Yeah . We noticed some cracks on the beams . There are cracks everywhere . You 've got a sonic Alpha in your holding cell . He 's trying to break out of here and he 's been trying since the minute he woke up . These vibrations are ... Well , they take time to build . I don 't trust her . For all we know she 's working with Kern . I 'm sorry about the knife , handsome . See , I don 't like it when people get close to me . I don 't like it when they can see me either . That 's why Kern 's so annoying with his sonar . Who are you working for ? Let 's just say it 's someone that 's interested in Kern 's research . His so-called vitamins . Look , I get paid for delivering Kern 's research , which I 've already gotten off your computers . I get a bonus for bringing in Kern . I can 't do that if I 'm dead . Let 's just call a truce . Let me take him out of here , I get my fee , you get to live . We all win . Hicks . Dr. Rosen , he 's bleeding again . Come with me . Oh , God . You 're still bleeding . What 's going on ? It 's probably the vibrations . It 's okay . It 's not like I 'm dying or anything . But you don 't want Doc here thinking you actually care about me . Very funny . Doc . Yeah ? Doc , take a look . Look . Yeah . Right there . Oh , my goodness . I can hear the rumbles . It 's getting worse . Doc , I think you need to take a look at him . I wasn 't hurting anyone . Don 't make me hurt you . Whatever happens to us is going to happen to you . If you bring this whole building down ... All I wanted was to bring more Alphas into the world . Why is that wrong ? Why are you treating me like a criminal ? Bill ! Bill , we 've got to get inside and stop him . Here . Take this . What is this ? It 's ether . It 's not elegant , but it 's quick . Go on . Ah ! It 's hot as hell . He 's turned the cell into a reverb chamber . He 's shaking the whole building and it 's creating heat . If it gets hot enough the metal might be at the breaking point . Dr. Rosen . Duck . Duck and cover . Bill , duck and cover . Gary , Gary , watch her . Yeah , okay . I 'll do both . Okay ? I 'll watch and I 'll cover . Okay , good . I 'll cover us . He 's lost too much blood . We got to get him out of here . Come on . Come on . Take him to the blast door . Yeah , okay . I 'll find Rosen . Who hired you ? I was told to bring you in alive , but that 's never going to happen . Who hired you ? It 's too late . No ! So much for my bonus . You know , a man with your abilities could make a lot of money if he went into business for himself . This is never going to happen . Yeah ? Well , I owe you one and I hate owing people . So I 'll pay you back . Stanton Parish . What the hell is that ? You better find out . Who knew office work was so dangerous , huh ? Stanton Parish , Bill ? Yeah . Yeah . It was something that Griffin threw at me as a parting gift , I guess . I don 't know . Maybe it 's a place , a person , I don 't know . Oh , we 'll look into it . Yeah , well , the sooner , the better , Doc . I told you that we needed gun turrets , Bill . You know what ? I talked to your mother and asked her , could we fight Alphas in your bedroom ? And she said no . What 's up with that ? That 's not helpful , Bill . My house would be the worst place to fight them . And anyway , my bedroom 's off limits . Gary , no , that 's a great place . I think , you know , we can keep them as prisoners there or ... Yeah . Yeah . I know what you 're trying to do , Bill , you 're trying to annoy me . But it 's not going to work . You know , you were a lot less annoying when you didn 't have your ability , and now that you 've got your ability back , you 're annoying again . You 're Bill again . You 're the old Bill . You 're damn right I am . Nina , you know , I have to clean up my office . Yeah , well , don 't want your wound to open up . Rachel would smell blood , she 'd get ... I get it . You like me . Don 't be so ... Don 't be so juvenile . Come on . I saw how you reacted when I got cut . I would have done the same thing to anyone . Hmm . Well , how about this ? That 's pretty grown up , huh ? Wow . I don 't care what Clay says , this was a bad idea . Yes , we do seem to be learning by trial and error , hmm . Mostly error . So no more prisoners in the office , right ? Oh , I certainly hope not , Rachel . You know , you saved all of us . Trapping Griffin and detecting Kern 's ability . Just trying to earn my paycheck . I scanned the entire office . There 's no sign of Griffin . She got away . And I 'm assuming that she took the data on Kern 's vitamins with her . Yeah , she probably delivered it to her new employers , wherever they are . Huh . Things aren 't going to get easier , are they ?

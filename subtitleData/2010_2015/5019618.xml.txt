 - Hey you . - Hey ! - Listen , can we talk ? - Rory ! No shut up . I 've just got a question , that 's all . You okay up there ? Yeah , fine , no problem . What are you doing ? Helping the Doctor ! Ahm ... it 's humming , is that okay ? Yeah , it 's fine , we 're just entering conceptual space Imagine a banana or anything curved , actually don 't , since it 's not curved or like a banana . Forget the banana . Ahm ... is he helping you fly the TARDIS ? Oh , test of the couplings two , seven and eleven . Like I showed you . How come he gets to , you never let me have a go ? Doctor ? Don 't . Seriously , I let her drive my car once . Yeah , to the end of the road . Where , according to Amy , there was an unexpected house . He 's jealous because I passed my test first time . - You cheated . You wore a skirt . - I didn 't wear a skirt . - That would have worked too . - No , I did wear a skirt , - but it was any old skirt . - Have you ever seen Amy drive , - Doctor ? - No . - Neither did her driving examiner . Actually , it was this one . It was this skirt . What was that ? Rory , did you drop a thermo coupling ? Sorry . How did you do that ? I told you , " Don 't drop them " . I specifically - mentioned not dropping . - It was my fault . - Of course , it wasn 't your fault . - It kind of was her fault . How can it be her fault ? Because it was my skirt , my husband and your glass floor . - Oh , Rory . - Sorry . We 've landed . The emergency materialisation should be fine , should have locked onto the safest space available . Doctor , what 's happened ? Safest spot available . The TARDIS has materialised inside itself . Is that supposed to happen ? Take a guess . - No . - That 's the one . What are you doing ? I 've absolutely no idea . Okay , that is a bit weird . That is actually pretty cool . Glad you 're entertained , Rory . Now that we 're stuck here for all eternity , - at least you won 't be bored . - Wait ! What ? We 're stuck ? Inside of the TARDIS is now joined to outside of the TARDIS , worse than a time loop , a space loop . Nothing can enter or leave this ship ever again . Okay , kids , this is where it gets complicated . Who the hell are you ? I 'm you ... from your future . Tell me exactly what 's happened . Well , the exterior shell of the TARDIS has drifted forwards in time . If you step into the box now you step inside the control room a tiny bit into the past . I don 't understand . Neither do I. - But you just said it . - No , I 'm just repeating it . I 'm just remembering what I heard myself saying when I was standing where you are standing now and repeating it . I 'm just repeating this , too , and this ... and this . Ah , I still don 't understand . You still don 't . Okay , when does this Amy step into the box ? We need to maintain the timeline . Ah . As soon as she 's slapped Rory . - Okay . - Ha ... No . Why do I get slapped ? Because we have to stick to the established chain of events . One mistake and the whole timeline could collapse . We 'll end up with two Amy Ponds forever , and then what would you do ? Oh . Okay , you , into the Policebox , now . And then I become her ? Yes , go , go , go . - Do I really look like that ? - Yeah . Yeah , you do . - I 'd give you a driving licence . - I bet you would . Oh , this is how it all ends ... Pond flirting with herself ! True love at last . - Oh ... Sorry , Rory . - Absolutely no problem at all . - Now , Amy . - What 's the first line ? - Okay , kids , this is where it gets complicated . - Gotcha . - So , is that it ? Are we okay now ? - No , we 're still trapped . What are you doing ? You told us to get into the police box . Well , from your point of view , you 're about to tell us to get into the police box . From our point of view , you just told us to get into the police box , which is why we got in the police box , which is why we 're ... here . - Do I have to remember all of that ? - It just sort of happens . - Hi . - Hi . Hey ! Stop that ! You two , into the police box now . Run . So ... What now ? You two ... stay where you are ! What are you doing ? I 'm setting up a controlled temporal implosion . It 's the only way to reset the TARDIS but unless I find exactly the right lever to control the implosion we 're all gonna die . You don 't know which leaver . No , but I 'm about to find out . The wibbley leaver ! The wibbley leaver . Thank you ! Okay . We 're back in normal flight , the TARDIS is no longer inside itself , the localised time field is no longer about to implode and rip a hole in all causality , but just in case ... Pond , put some trousers on .

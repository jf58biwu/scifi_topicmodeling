 Previously on Heroes ... Wait a second . Is that Claire ? - Samuel wants to surrender . - Really ? - Why ? - To protect his family . He 'll turn himself over as long as the rest of the carnival stays safe and under the grid . I found him on the hill ... with this ! She 's gonna kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . Tell me exactly what you saw . - You cannot save her . - But someone else can . Don 't worry . I 'm here to save you . He 's trapped . - What did you do ? - I trapped him in his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . - I have to bring him back . - You can 't do that . You might not come out . Peter , don 't ! Is that really you ? Came to get you out . It is you , isn 't it ? I thought I was alone , that everyone was dead . - What are you doing here ? - To drag your sorry ass out of here . Let 's go . There is no getting out . I 've tried ... for three years . What are you talking about ? It 's been three hours . Wait a minute . You 're not ... you 're not real . This is my mind , isn 't it ? This is my mind playing tricks on me , as part of my punishment , isn 't it ? You think I 'll let you taunt me ? Stay away . If you follow me , I 'll kill you ! Do you understand ? I swear I 'll kill you . Get out of my head . Calm down . I 'm telling you the truth . I came to take you out of here . Why do you keep saying that ? I went to Parkman 's house . He put you here . - This is a dream . - It 's not a dream ! This is real . You don 't understand this is a nightmare ? Hell , yes , it 's a nightmare . Three years , completely alone . Not years , hours . All right ? Parkman trapped you here . - Parkman ? Impossible . - Is it ? What 's the last thing you remember before coming here ? I remember ... wanting my life to change , thinking I was gonna spend all of eternity alone . Exactly . And here you are . I 've got Parkman 's ability . I can take you out of here . Why would you want to do that ? The brother of the man I murdered coming to my aid ? Because I need you to help me . I could leave you here to rot , but I need you to save her , my friend Emma . In the dream , you save her before she kills thousands of people . Wrong guy . I 'm not the savior kind , and you should know that . It 's gonna happen , and you 're gonna save her . Fine . You really think you can get us out of here ? Let me see you try . Go ahead . See ? We won 't go anywhere . We 're trapped here , forever . - We got to do something with her . - We will . Excuse me . I wanna see my father . He 's safe , unharmed , which is more than he deserves after shooting innocent people . My dad didn 't shoot anyone . If he had , you would be dead . You 're not that naive , are you ? He came to this carnival with a gun , intent on using it . Isn 't that why you tried to negotiate my surrender ? - You were afraid he 'd do this . - I want to see my father now ! Your devotion to your father is touching , but you 're blinded by it . It 's time for you to open your eyes and see your father for who he is . I know who he is . Nothing you say will change that . Of course not . That 's why I 'll show you . - Dad ! - Thank God you 're all right . Untie him . Not quite yet . Damien has the ability to reveal a person 's memories . It 's fairly painless if you don 't fight it . You think showing my dad 's memories is gonna enlighten me ? You deserve the truth . Let her go . You don 't need her anymore . You afraid she 'll see the real you ? Don 't do this . Take a peek . See where it all began . This one has it all . White walls , wire wheel covers , - wood grain , everything . - The kids 'll love it . - What 's the payment look like ? - $ 150 a month . I know , that 's kind of steep . Look ... You didn 't hear this from me , but go to Val 's Discount Motors on La Cienega . The same model , maybe a year older , probably half of what you 'll pay here . Thanks . Really appreciate that . Guess who ? Let me see . Soft , lovely hands , long , supple fingers . I don 't know . Candy ? - Candy ? - I 'm in trouble . It 's my wife . What are you doing here ? I came by to see how the most handsome salesman 's doing . If I see him , I 'll ask him . Me ... not so good . I stink at this job . - I have no killer instinct . - You don 't belong here . - You should be home writing plays . - Somebody has to pay the rent . Who needs money ? We can live on love . Wouldn 't that be nice ? What 's going on ? Is something wrong ? I hope not . It 's just I have some unexpected news . - And promise me you won 't get mad . - Kate , what is it ? I 'm pregnant . I know we didn 't plan this , and you always want to be the man with the plan , but ... You 're happy ? Of course , I 'm happy . I 'm gonna be a father ! You had another wife and family ? I 'm sorry I never told you . It doesn 't matter . Let him go . You 're not curious about what happened to his first wife ? It 's his business ... There are reasons he kept it secret . Isn 't that right ? Let her go . You got what you wanted , someone to blame , me . Look at the fear in his eyes . He knows what 's coming . I 'll leave you with Damien . You 'll find it very informative . Don 't do this , you son of a bitch ! Did you order pot stickers ? Double order . You 're eating for two now . Can you believe this ? You and me , parents . What 's it gonna be like ? I have no idea . But I can 't wait to find out . The moo shu has arrived . Go . Delivery . What happened to Mr. Yin ? He usually delivers . He couldn 't make it . Okay , so ... how much do I owe you ? All of it . I can 't move . What did you do ? Where 's the money ? - How did you do that ? - Kate , give him your purse . - This is it ? - That 's all . Take it and go . What are you ? Kate ... My God . Give it up . Can 't go forever without talking to me . I mean , you 've gone a month . That 's impressive . There isn 't anybody out there . There never will be . I won 't spend the rest of my life here , alone , with you . It isn 't exactly heaven for me either . Here . I know you like comics . I couldn 't find Doc Savage or Flash . What 's wrong ? You need to stop messing around and focus . Focus , right ? ' cause we got to get out of here so we can go rescue ... What 's her name again ? Emma . Her name 's Emma . It 's time to face reality . That girl is gone . If she was meant to kill thousands , they 're dead too . Everybody 's dead except us . The only thing that 's real is us . You think you 've been here for years , but this is all just a dream . If this is all a dream , how are there books , huh ? - How did Parkman make books ? - Because it 's your dream . How could I know all the words to Pillars of the Earth or Catch-22 ? Maybe you read it somewhere , - it 's in your subconscious . - I didn 't read 9th wonders ! - I did . - So now we 're in your head ? I don 't know ! I don 't know how this all works ! - Don 't you want to get out of here ? - Yeah , of course ! You don 't , do you ? - You don 't want to get out of here . - Maybe I deserve all this aloneness ... This nothing , maybe I earned it . Yeah , maybe you have , but I can 't do this on my own . I need you to help me ... All right , Peter . You want me to help you ? I want to help . Where did that come from ? That 's the wall from ... Parkman 's basement . What 's it doing here ? - This is our way out . - What ? Don 't you get it ? We have to break through . Can I help you ? I was just leaving . You 're hurt . Let me see . I 'm a doctor . Please . You don 't have to do this . I don 't want you to get in trouble . I have a hearing loss . Say that again ? My name is Lauren . I came here to stop Samuel Sullivan . You were with the man who shot everyone . Bennet ? Bennet never fired his gun . Your leader , Samuel , is not what he appears to be . He 's the one responsible . He wouldn 't shoot his own people . You 're wrong . He 's done terrible things . And now he 's trying to galvanize his people around a common enemy . I got to check in with the doc . Samuel 's coming . Don 't tell him I 'm here ! Everything all right ? It 's all right . I just want to talk . Well , look what we have here . Your first wife was murdered by a special ? That was a long time ago . And the person I was then died that night with Kate . I 'm sorry I never told you . That 's okay . Some things you just can 't ... say out loud . But that 's the reason why you joined the company . That 's how you became Mr. Bag and tag . I don 't need to see any more . Don 't move . - You want my wallet ? Take it . - Don 't move ! I 'm not after your money . What , then ? Information . I know what you are . I know what you can do . - How ? - It doesn 't matter . I 'm looking for somebody , one of you . One of me ? What are you talking about ? - There 's someone else like me ? - Don 't give me that . What you do isn 't normal . You have to know each other . The guy I 'm looking for is named Richard . He 's about 6 feet tall , got dark hair . Maybe 23 years old . He can move things with his mind . He killed my wife . I don 't know anyone else like me . I swear . I don 't believe you . - It was an accident . - You brought a gun . I didn 't know what I would find . I was scared . The first time you killed anyone . What happens next ? One owner , low miles , hottest car I got on the lot . It 's the best I can do , take it or leave it . - You said ... - You know , I got another buyer who 's chomping at the bit . What 's it gonna be ? I guess we 'll take it . Excellent choice . I 'll have my manager draw up the papers . Excuse me . Hey , there . - Can I interest you in a car ? - Not really . I 'm here to offer you a job . - Do I know you ? - We 've been watching you . The way you killed that special ... The repairman . We 'd been tracking him too , only you got there first . Relax . Your secret is safe with us . We 're impressed , so impressed , in fact , we 'd like you to come work for us . Who are you ? My name is Thompson . My associates and I can help you Find the man who killed your wife . And then you can help us ... find the rest . How 's it working out for you , the ... " one of us , one of them ? " To tell you the truth , it 's been quite an adjustment . I mean , Claude can go invisible anytime he wants . - It gives him a distinct advantage . - Advantage ? You 're supposed to be partners . What is it , trust issues ? I mean , how could it not be ? He 's abnormal . I mean , sometimes when I 'm alone , I get ... this feeling in my gut that he 's watching me . - You know what I mean ? - Yeah , I do . You know , your case is highly unusual , Bennet . How you came to our attention , what happened to your wife . It would be only natural that you would harbor a grudge . - What are you getting at ? - 17 cases , three deaths , all attributed to you . They were all accidents . That 's been verified . Two corned beefs . Need anything else ? No , we 're all set . Thanks . At this point , the company has too much invested in you to cut ties . But we do need you to make a change . Take a wife , start a family . Is that a joke ? It 'll put your life in balance , calm you down ... so there will be fewer incidents . A wife ? - I can 't do that again . - Sure , you can . That cute number who brought the sandwiches will do fine . And if I refuse ? You won 't . The company arranged your marriage . They encouraged me but I chose your mother because I loved her . You know that . The company seems to make a lot of decisions for you . They made many decisions . That 's all over with . All the memories you 're seeing now , that 's all they are . It 's just the past . Hey , Mr. Bennet . What are you doing here ? Came to see Claire . Would you know where she is ? . No idea . You don 't have to lie for her . I know that Claire stole the compass , and I would bet good money the two of you drove out to the carnival together . My question is , why didn 't she come back with you ? She wanted to stay . She said she 'd be back on Monday . You left her there ? Do you not see what 's happening ? That she is getting involved in something that she clearly doesn 't understand . Maybe she wants to understand it . This isn 't a game . These carnival people are killers . You don 't think I know that ? She needs to be with people like her . If they 're not good for her , trust her to know the difference . You have to stop encouraging her . You need to work with me on this . - I want her to be happy . - She is happy , with you here in college , Living a normal life . What if that 's not enough for her ? It has to be . What 's he doing here ? Are you gonna erase my memory ? Not if you do what I ask . You were missing . I didn 't know how to find you , if I would find you . - You don 't trust me . - I don 't trust Samuel . - Gretchen is fine . - You threatened her ! And this was not some distant past . This was now . - You should eat . - Don 't need to eat . Don 't need to sleep . Don 't need anything . Any progress today ? It 's just like yesterday ... - And the day before that . - And ... the day before that . Now it 's been ... I don 't even know how long it 's been . - Don 't tell me how long it 's been . - You can 't even dent it , Peter . I don 't know how much longer you can keep this up . As long as it takes . I know that look . You have it all the time . What look ? Like when Kaplan beat you at the dash and we ran to school every morning and kept training and kept it up , right ? That is Nathan 's memory . That 's not yours . I told you to stop doing that . You 're not him . You 're nothing like him . So you 've told me . Look , I know that I 've said it before , but ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry that I killed him . I 'm sorry that I took him from you . Sorry ! You keep saying that " I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " That 's not gonna bring my brother back . - It doesn 't change anything . - You 're right ! Nothing changes ! We 're stuck here forever , you and me ! I can 't take it anymore . You 're with that company , - cut from the same cloth as Bennet . - This doesn 't have to end badly . You can turn yourself in , release Bennet and his daughter . - Why would I do that ? - You love your family , and you don 't want them to get hurt , and they will get hurt . You people are always so sure of yourselves . I know what 's best for my own family . - And what is that ? - Change . We 're strong enough to show ourselves , take what 's ours . You don 't have the right to take anything . Of course we do . We deserve admiration , respect . And you intend to hurt people to get it ? What would you have me do ? Continue with this life ? Live in a carnival ? Why not ? You 've lived here happily for years . Wasted years , unfulfilled years . I could 've been so much more . You know about me ? About the film ? Do you know how powerful I can really be ... if I brought them all here ? My brother said I could move mountains , cities . I wonder . Is it true ? Can I change the world ? I hope to God we never find out . What did the world ever do to you ? Should 've treated me better . Don 't do this , please . The Bennet girl left the house of mirrors . Well , I 'll just have to have a word with her . It 's time to gather the family . Tell them to pack up . We 're moving on to biggerthings . Tell them it 's gonna be the greatest show we 've ever done . You 've been quite helpful , Lauren . You and your friends take care of her , would you ? Thanks . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna end this . I can 't bring Nathan back , Peter . But I can sure as hell swing a sledgehammer . I 'm sorry to put you through that . I hope through this painful experience you can finally see the truth . You were right , Samuel . My dad is a bad guy . I belong with you . You 're my hero . That 's what you want to hear , what this is all about . Why didn 't you show me the memory my dad has of shooting Lydia ? That wasn 't on the program ? Maybe he didn 't pull the trigger last night . But does that negate all the times that he has ? To this day , he lies to you , deceives you , his darling daughter , because he can 't trust any of us . You actually thought that I would turn on him ? You just don 't understand , do you ? Maybe it was 'cause no one ever really loved you . You call these people your family , but they 're not . They fear you . Give me my dad , and we 're leaving . No , sorry . You 're too important . Especially when everything 's ready to change . What 's going on ? Where 's everyone going ? I was talking to a new friend about who I am , what I can be . The way she looked at me , She was so afraid . I want to see that look again a thousand times over . Meaning what ? It 's time for our biggest show ever . No more hiding in the shadows . It 's time to show ourselves , be strong . We 're going to New York City , bring the whole place to Central Park . We 'll show them how powerful we are . You can 't do that . Some lives will unfortunately be lost , but they 'll fear us , respect us . - It 's what we 've always wanted . - I have never wanted that . You will inherit this new world . It 's your legacy . You will remind them what I 've done long after I 've gone . That 's why you must be a part of our family . You are desperate . And you 're small . I will never be a part of your family . You sound just like your father . I had so hoped to convince you . In time , you can change your mind . Don 't hold your breath . Right . Your father 's in the souvenir trailer . I had a little trouble with the government lady , playing some cat and mouse , but the mouse got away . - Do you want me to go find her ? - Not worth it . - Everything okay ? - It will be . Claire Bennet needs some time to think about my offer . I 'll give her that opportunity . I want to explain what you saw . We 'll talk about it later . What is that ? Now I 'm ready to go . - New York City . - Sounds fun . It will be . I 'm afraid you 'll have to join us later . There 's loose ends to attend to . Before Lydia died , she spoke of people who want to interfere with our plans . I 'll need you to stop them , permanently . Happy birthday . It 's not my birthday . I know . You just wore out your other copy ... and I saw that one , digging around . I appreciate you ... being patient with me , keeping me sane . That 's very kind of you . Thank you . You want to know something weird ? Every time you pick that thing up , I think you 'll hit me really hard . That is weird , every time I pick it up , I feel like I 'll hit you too . - Really hard . - Why ? Because you are who you are . I wish I could accept your apologies , but if I forgive you , I 'm not doing right by him . If you let go of your anger , you 're afraid you 'll lose him forever ? So you 've held on to it this entire time ? I feel it slipping away , but ... then I look at you , and I see you killing him . You took my brother away from me . We 've been here for I don 't know how many years . Together . I 've changed . I 've repented . I 'll never hurt anyone ever again . And all this time , you were afraid to let me out . I 'm not that guy anymore . You know that . I know . I know you 're not . How long has it been , really ? Half a day , maybe . It feels like we were in there for years . Does that make it any less real ? Let 's save Emma . Sorry to break up the love fest , but I 'll make sure that doesn 't happen . No signal . - You all right ? - Yeah , you ? Here , help me get these ropes off . Is that a lantern over there ? - We 're buried . - How far down do you think we are ? I don 't know . It felt like we dropped 40 or 50 feet . Can anybody hear us ? Help ! Can anybody hear us ?

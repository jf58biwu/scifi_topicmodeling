 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Come on old friend so what , you think our Jimmy took a playdate ? If there 's a history log in here , we could look up ... There . Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually- - a woman ... Could you please be careful with that I know all about it . You what ? I was Apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . [ Electricity crackles ] [ both grunting ] Oh ! Cavorite was an anti-gravity metal that Wells about , but cavorite doesn 't exist . [ Gasps ] James ? James ! I 'm sorry , Arthur . You stop trying to confuse me ! [ Gunshot ] Pete , you 've been infected by an artifact . Myka , you and Artie , you got to get out of here . He 's got snipers all over the place ! The telegraph seems to have tapped into some subliminal anxiety . Take some time off , Agent Lattimer . Hmm . I guess I 'm just lucky that the only vet in Univille makes house-calls . I love ferrets . Besides , this is a farming community and if I didn 't make house-calls , my office would look like a traveling circus . Myka ! Guess how many croissants I shoved into my mouth at once . One day you 'll have to tell me how you got partnered up with that one . Well , the croissant thing 's actually kind of impressive when you see it . Yeah , at least it keeps him from talking . Oh , that 's right . You prefer your males to bark and hump your leg . I 'm sure it 's in your repertoire . Okay , okay . Thank you . You know , we have to get back to work , but thank you so much for coming . Myka , for you , anytime . Okay . What is with you two ? She started it . Good , good , you 're here . Follow me . We got a ping . Awesome . Time to get back out there and kick some artifact butt . Mmm , not you , no . Until we 're sure that there 's no residual effect from your last encounter , you are grounded . Myka , you 're going to Tamalpais University in Northern California . Artie , this is about a wrestling team . [ Overlapping arguing ] God , all right , all right . Yes , yes . It 's about a wrestling team . This wrestling team , they 've lost every match for the last seven years and overnight , they 've become unstoppable . No , this is- - this is one of ours . I know you wrestled in college . What can I say ? Irony is my specialty . So- - grounded ! This team was tested for steroids , right ? One of the kids on the team died three weeks ago , in a fire , alone , camping . If an artifact is helping them , it could also be killing them . Okay , I 'm on it . Yeah , Claudia , take this , because you 're going with Myka to California as a backup . For reals ? My first official assignment as an Agent ? Shut up ! As ... An Apprentice . While you 're on campus , enroll and get a degree , will you ? Will you never stop with that ? [ Cheering ] Should I have worn something more business-suity , you know , so people take me seriously as an Agent ? You 're not an Agent . You 're an Apprentice . Right . Apprentice . Taking notes . " Jeans are fine . " [ Grunts ] [ Whistle blows ] Well , it looks like they won again . Think the artifact 's in here ? Anything 's possible , but artifacts don 't talk . People talk . Right . Interviews with people , indeed . I 'm ready to begin my Apprentice education . ( Team ) Hoo-wah ! Always happy to answer questions on how much we 're winning , but I 'm not sure what exactly you 're investigating . Apprentice really be in here ? We just have some routine questions for you . Gary ! Gary , come talk to these ladies . Sure , Coach . What 's up ? Hi , Gary , is it ? So why do you think your team started winning ? I mean , what changed ? Coach Tappon finally got our asses in gear . He got us to want it again . And if you want it bad enough , you 're gonna crush it . And now we 're crushing it . But seven straight seasons without a win and now all of a sudden- - [ towel snaps ] Oh ! [ Laughter ] Claudia , do you want to see what 's going on out in the hallway ? Okay , thanks , bye . [ Grunts ] Hey . Hey , aren 't you the guy who just won ? I feel weird . My muscles are hurting bad . I think I need a- - [ grunts ] Ah ! Myka ! Myka ! [ Ethereal music ] ♪ Warehouse 13 2x07 ♪ For the Team Original Air Date on August 17 , 2010 One death on the team is bad enough . Two is ... Unthinkable . But I know Phillip would want us to go on . How 'd it go with the police ? [ Sighs ] He just caught on fire , Myka . I should have done something . There wasn 't anything to do . You would have done something . You would stay calm at least . I literally freaked out . So the police are calling it an accident ? Of undetermined cause . But I hacked the coroner 's report on both desks . Check it out . Teddy Benson , the wrestler who died in the campsite fire ? Burn patterns show that the fire started inside his sleeping bag . Okay , so two deaths by spontaneous combustion on the same wrestling team . Yeah , I call shenanigans . And unless a sweaty gym sock is the artifact , then there 's nothing that- - okay , there 's that . ( Team ) Hoo-wah ! Oh , yeah . You can score that a 9.8 . All right , I 'm gonna go talk to the Coach about that medal and you follow up with the team . Wait . Follow up ? By myself ? Yeah . Talk to them . You know , investigate . Sure . Yeah , I 'll just follow up . [ Imitating jet fighter ] Ahh , mom ! Pete ! Are those Timothy Leary 's glasses ? Take them off right now . That 's not a toy . I 'm bored , okay ? They make things so much less boring . Did you hear what I said ? Take ' em off right now . Right now . Wouldn 't you rather have a nice little fish ? Okay , stop it . Give me the glasses . Don 't ! Get up out of my chair . Child . Man , desk duty is lame . Ow . Oh , it 's nothing personal , senor sensitivo . No . Ow . What ? What ? What is it ? It 's nothing . It 's no big deal . It 's just probably my appendix growing back . Your who with the what now ? Yeah , it 's , uh ... Grows back every year . It 's a side effect of spending too much time in the Warehouse . [ Imitating Scooby Doo ] Hmm ? Nothing to worry about . It 's all good . Yeah , I need a visit from the doctor . Yeah . What ? Are you serious ? Touching a gold medal caused them to burn up ? You got both paddles in the water ? You were a champion . Now you 're a Coach . I know what it 's like to do good work and no one notices . A winning team puts you back on top . Whoa . You think I 'm involved in their deaths ? You 're out of your mind . If I 'm crazy , show me the medal . I 'm not showing you anything . Coach Tappon , we 'd love for you to join us whenever you 're free . Great , Jeff . I 'm sorry . Just give me a sec . Be right with you . Great . Now I 'm pissing off the team 's benefactors so you can accuse me of attacking my guys . I am just trying to protect- - if you scare my guys , I 'll have you thrown off this campus . [ Knock on door ] So , Gary , is it ? Yeah . Um ... Can I help you ? So Coach Tappon . Does he ever seem maybe too intent on winning ? " Too intent on winning " ? I don 't even know what that means . I mean does he put you under a lot of , you know , pressure ? Pressure ? Have you ever tried getting out of a half nelson with a 200-pound monster 's on top of you ? Okay , now when you say , " monster , " I 'm gonna assume you mean a really big guy and not an actual monster , because in my line of work- - what I mean is pressure is good . It makes you win . Okay , yes , but does the Coach care about your safety or just winning ? Would he risk a wrestler 's life to , I don 't know , place in a match- - hey , this is my Coach we 're talking about . I 'm not gonna let you rip on him . Oh , no , no , no . No , I wouldn 't deign to rip . I 'm just ... Observing , analyzing the facts , supposing a possible- - interrogating the- - not that you- - you okay ? You seem kind of new at this . Are you , like , that other lady 's assistant or something ? Or something . If I need anything , I 'll circle back . Thanks so much for coming , doctor . And how 's that ? Does that hurt ? It 's fine . No , no . How about there ? No . So our own Warehouse doctor , huh ? Yes , Pete , it 's in the manual , chapter 112 , section F , paragraph 3 . Yeah , yeah . I haven 't quite gotten to chapter 112 yet . Yeah , why don 't you go downstairs and read it right now ? Well , I was hoping you 'd read it to me , papa . Vanessa , I 'm really sorry about him . And I 'm sorry you have to come all the way to South Dakota just for this . Oh , well , your appendix is always the highlight of my year , Artie . Wow . What 's the rest of your year like ? Have you been working on your meridians ? My- - the acupuncture points I asked you to tap on like this . Yeah , just--I remember . Ah ! [ Laughs ] I 'm really ticklish there . You can 't do that . I know . Sit up . Okay . Yes , I have , actually . I 've worked on- - oh , you 're lying . Yes , I am . If you 're gonna blow hot air , will you mind blowing into this for me , please ? [ Blows whistle ] Well , you 're not infected . Oh , that 's good , right ? Yeah , it 's good . Given your proclivity to appendicitis , I really still think we should remove it again . Okay . Just prophylactically . [ Snorts ] " Prophylactically " ? Shut up . I place myself in your hands . Okay , let me go put on some scrubs . Prepare the procedure room and I 'll let you know when I 'm ready for you , okay ? Okay , awesome . [ Whistling ] [ Sighs ] Maybe I 'm wrong , but ... Are Vanessa and Artie sitting in a tree ? Ah , don 't be absurd . We 're two adults who just have a lot of professional respect for each other . And shut up . K-I-s-s-I-n-g . I knew it . Newsflash : Artie is human . Walk away . You like her . Stop it . You want to hug her and kiss her ... Right . I 'm walking away . And squeeze her and all right ! Don 't touch me there . Good , you 've got the purple goo . Coach Tappon 's office is empty . Artie said there 's no record of Tappon 's medal on file , but we should still goo it just in case . It was hard to hear . Pete kept singing something about Artie in a baby carriage . Good . Well , let 's go get this medal . Do you think he 's doing this on purpose ? No , but I think he 's hiding something . How can you tell , like , just from one interview ? I mean , is that instinct ? Well , instinct is just a fancy way of saying I 've done this 10,000 times . You don 't think maybe this guy 's different ? Well , human beings are predictable and people rarely surprise you . Turn around and put your hands in the air . Slowly . H.G. Wells . Agent Bering . Seems we 're forever destined to meet at gunpoint . Ladies , I know this is a bit awkward , but maybe we could just- - [ coughs ] Or we could just do this . You are going back to the Bronze Sector . Why ? What did I do ? You 're a killer and a thief . Brain requires ... Oxygen ... To speak . Myka . Oh ! [ coughs ] I 'm not a killer . Oh , has the definition of " killer " changed a bunch since the 1890s ? 'Cause , H.G. , you killed a guy . James MacPherson ? He would have quite happily killed all of you . Why are you here ? Did you just happen to show up ? I 'm hunting for the same artifact as you . That 's what we 're looking for . That 's rather my point . Take it . And if you didn 't believe me just a little , you 'd have shot me by now . [ Door opens and closes ] [ Indistinct chatter ] The Coach . He can 't find us here . He can 't find you in here . He hasn 't met me yet . What ? Do not . Don 't . No . Is your name Coach Tappon ? Yeah . Oh , thank God I 've found you . She 's good . Yeah , sure , in an obvious kind of way . Worked on Pete in London . Well , that 's not exactly scaling Mt . Everest , is it ? Come on , let 's call Artie . [ Indistinct chatter ] An appendectomy ? Are you- - yeah , forget- - I 'm fine . Just tell me exactly what 's going on . Room 's all set . Are you ? Uh , as ever . Just one second , 'cause I 'm in the- - okay . Yeah , look- - you know what ? I got it . Just--just take care of yourself . Okay , thanks . [ Farnsworth buzzes ] My turn . Oh . Don 't start without me . [ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] What ? Nothing . I was just wondering ... What this ... Was doing on your shelf . Yeah , I 'm wondering what you 're doing messing around with my thing . That 's the Barnum to Ba-bam ! Oh , that 's right , sir . I 've been doing a little read-a-roonie of the artifact manifest . Fascinating stuff . Turns out P.T. Barnum used this to , and I quote , " increase the shock factor " in his sideshows by using it to grow human limbs and in some cases , internal organs . " You , sir , have been growing back your appendix in an attempt to get Vanessa to visit the Warehouse ! That 's so romantic . Are you quite finished ? If only ... So , " no , " then . There were some way for you to ... Interact with Vanessa that did not involve invasive surgery . Perhaps some kind of- - [ sighs ] I don 't know . Social ritual . One involving the sharing of food or the enjoying of filmed entertainment with maybe some duds that have been milked . Ahh . I mean a date . I know what you mean . Artie , you like her . She--hey , hey , hey--likes you . Ask the woman out . Okay . Artie ? I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna have to postpone the surgery . A Regent has tungsten poisoning , of all things , and I have to leave for Budapest immediately . Ooh , that sounds serious there . You should go . All right . Yeah . I got to make my flight arrangements . Get out of my sight . Don 't come near me . I 'll kill you . Really ? Nothing ? Nope . The medal is not the artifact , which also means that H.G. had nothing to lose by handing it over . Unless she didn 't know either . Oh , she knew . I don 't know what her game is , but I don 't trust her . Well , I swiped Tappon 's records from the personnel office . Last month , he moved to bayside heights . Very schmancy and Richie Rich . Where does a college wrestling Coach get the money to buy a house like that ? Maybe H.G. ' S paying him off . Where would she get the money ? Well , you accrue a lot of interest in 100 years . I 'm gonna go snoop around for a connection . You finish interviewing the wrestling team . Um , no , maybe I should stick to the computer stuff . I 'm really not good at the interviews , especially with , you know , people . Mm-hmm . Okay , so ... Why do you say that ? Well , I tried to be like you , you know ? All professional and adult and that- - is really ... [ laughs ] Really dumb . Is that your version of a pep talk ? No . We already have one me . We don 't need another me , okay ? I want you to go in there and be more like you . What would that get us ? Claudia , you 're the same age as these guys . You 're a peer . You can connect with them . Yeah , not so much . Okay . Okay then . Go back to the Warehouse then . You know , not everyone 's cut out for field work . You know , stay behind a computer forever . Forever 's kind of a long time . I don 't have time to hold your hand through this , Claude . If you are not up for this- - well , I didn 't say that . Okay , well , let me know how it goes . Okay , I will . Good then . Good . Oh , I know what you did there . I know . It 's ' cause you 're smart . Go . [ Knock on door ] Gar-bear , afternoon . Let 's talk . Hey . Irritating question girl . We kind of already talked . No , you already avoided telling me anything . Now we talk . By the way , Photoshop . Anyway , check this . Phillip and Teddy 's deaths were not accidental . My Intel says Coach is dirty . Maybe even got some payola . Thoughts ? Stratego . What do you know ? Nothing . It 's just a feeling . Spill it , hulkling . Don 't make me angry . Coach Tappon saved us , okay ? I mean , in a town like this , you either work at the bottling plant or you get out . And now even the plant 's about to close down . Because of Coach , now I have options and maybe a scholarship . I have people who did that for me too . Gave me options . Then you know I can 't turn on him . Yeah , but , dude ... If something bad 's happening to your friends , even by accident , don 't you owe them too ? [ Sighs ] He started acting weird after Teddy died . Closed-door meetings , phone calls in the middle of practice . He was acting- - guilty ? No . Scared . No , it 's too dangerous . Listen to me . They think I 'm responsible . And what if I am ? No , I 'm sorry , but I 'm ending this now . [ Tires screeching ] Okay , here 's here we go . What you 're gonna do . Set something up for when she gets back . Dinner , a movie- - shh ! Shh ! I can 't do that . Take her for a walk . Show her the dark vault . Doesn 't matter , okay ? Just make a plan . I don 't know- - okay . Then be one of those agents that 's obsessed with the Warehouse . That always works out so well . All right . Well , now you know you 're not infected , so you should be all right till I get back , Artie . You okay with this ? Um ... Have a nice flight . Thanks . [ Sighs ] Geez , Artie , it 's not like she hasn 't already seen you naked . Thank you very much for that . This was no accident . It means someone else out there knows about the artifact . Look who 's here . Keep an eye on things , Claude . Hey ! Our lead suspect is killed and look who shows up . Oh , do stop it . What motive could I have possibly had for killing those boys and a wrestling Coach ? That 's an excellent question . Perhaps we should ask the Regents . They did have you bronzed once . You know as well as I , women are held to a different standard . Something , by the way , I thought would have changed by now . Don 't you dare play that card with me . Why not ? Your partner died and people whispered . If you 'd been a man- - nice . That 's very clever . You did your research . What did you steal from the Escher Vault ? [ Scoffs ] That 's what I thought . I took back what was mine . Oh , and what is that ? That more cavorite ? What are you gonna do , yank me up into the sky ? The only power it has is over me . It 's my daughter . Was . My Christina . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now , except the Warehouse . Look , I know what it 's like to lose someone , but- - I want to come back and work there again . You what ? That 's why I 'm doing all of this . To prove I am still a good Agent . Look , I 'm sorry about your little girl . I really am . But it 's not possible- - please ? You can 't- - please ? Every day in this world is a reminder of what I 've lost . My child , my friends , my life . I have no tether here . The Warehouse is the only home I have now . [ Tires screeching ] [ Gunshots ] Ooh ! Whoa ! I do miss the horse and buggy days . Progress is in many ways overrated . [ Gasps ] Whoo ! Ahh . Whoo ! A grappling hook ? I designed it myself . What ? Nothing . It 's just a little old fashioned . Well , it wasn 't when I invented it . And it seems to have saved your life . And yet you 're still wondering if I set this whole thing up just to prove my innocence . Well , the thought did cross my mind somewhere between , " holy crap , I 'm gonna die , " and , " oh , I 'm flying ! " And what have you concluded ? The jury 's still out . I suppose if we work together , it may be faster . And you could keep an eye on me . Yes . That thought crossed my mind too . You coming ? Hey , look what I found . Tag says it reduces shyness , so I- - ah ! Ow , ow ! Artie ! Pain . Lots . Not good . Never hurt like this before . Well , that 's ' cause the doc always took it out . Yeah , must still be growing . Might keep growing till it bursts . Ow . You know , this is called breaking and entering these days . It always was . Things haven 't changed much . Oh . Uh , why don 't you take the desk ? I 'll go through the closet . Aye , aye . So you built that gun , huh ? You are coveting my grappler . Old fashioned , indeed . Admiring maybe . Not coveting . My technical skill could come in very handy when I come back to work . Why were you bronzed ? The scales that lady justice holds are more easily tipped than one knows . The world is never as you think it should be . Well , it 's not my decision anyway . You know , I don 't even think it 's Artie 's . Of course . No pressure . Just making conversation . Pointed conversation , but nevertheless- - here . Let me do it . Oh . H.G. , come here . Look at these pictures . These are all of Phillip , only he 's- - quite a bit more of a roly-poly . Look at the dates on these files . He did this in three weeks . Something 's turning these boys into perfect specimens . And then killing them . Just a little farther , Artie . To this chair . Oh , little help here . At some point , you people will have to realize that " Veterinarian " means " animal doctor , " not humans . Hey , I don 't want to be here either , so- - look , Doc Wellins is out of town . His appendix is about to burst , so it 's either the vet or the barber . An appendectomy ? You do realize that most of the surgeries I perform are spaying and neutering ? Okay , the barber . The barber . Oh ! Look , Artie . Please sit down . Okay . I mean , come on . Help the guy out . Hey , I can make him look like a giant walrus , if that makes it any easier . Artie , I will help you , if only to take you out of his care . Good idea . Come on . Let 's go to the exam room . Ow ! Hey , croissant-boy , I need a prep nurse . Get in here . Okay , but I 'm not shaving anything . More wrestlers are getting sick . Pretty soon the whole team 's gonna end up extra crispy . That 's strange . Why would they put a padlock on a fridge ? " Boiling Point Energy Drink " ? Myka , every time I saw Gary , he was chugging one of these drinks . It 's the drink . Claudia , you have to get to Gary and warn him . On it . The artifact is in the drink . So Dr. Mahoney , you created the Boiling Point formula ? Yes , and there 's nothing harmful in it . It 's vitamins , caffeine , amino acids . It 's like any other drink on the market except that ours is specially formulated to accelerate muscle growth . It helps people . You 're testing it on the wrestling team at Tamalpais . There are laws against that . Nonsense ! It was a focus group . The kids were getting faster , stronger- - and combustible . Boiling Point financially supports the team and you paid Coach Tappon to get them to drink it . That wasn 't my idea ! It was mine . Jeff Russell . Welcome , ladies . Gerald , they 're looking for you in the lab . Great . On campus , you pulled Coach Tappon into a meeting . Boiling Point is your company . Founder and CEO , miss ? Agent Bering , Secret Service . And you are ? Agent Wells . Who is also an Agent under me . Does whatever I say . Lots of companies support school teams and we owe a lot to this town . And for me , it was personal . You were on the wrestling team ? Coach Tappon helped to focus my life . I wanted to give something back . So what ? So people died . Coach Tappon died . And I 'm sad about that . But I 'm still waiting to hear your proof that my drink was responsible . Or you could come with me and I can prove to you that it 's completely harmless . Might be a trap . Usually is . Here 's my impression of Pete at the sight of blood . [ Imitating retching ] No , no , no , no , no . Yes . I never sounded like- - okay , that 's fairly accurate . Just ' cause I was worried about him . Oh , right , right . It 's sweet . A little girly , but sweet . Girly . Artie , we thought you would recuperate better here , but you got to promise that you 're gonna try to get some rest . Great . Artie loves resting . Oh , and he will , because I 'm putting you in charge . If he 's not up on his feet in a couple of days , I 'm coming after you . You 're in charge ? That 's right , old boy . I 'll go get you some soup . Okay . You should ask her out . Me ask her out ? Yeah . Right . Or be one of those agents obsessed with the Warehouse . That always works out so well . You weren 't talking to me . Oh , no ? No . Oh , well , who was I talking to ? I don 't know . Let 's just see . When I died in the tunnel , didn 't you think for just an instant , " poor Artie . He gave his life to this place and he died alone " ? Hmm ? And since then , I see what 's been happening to you . What happening ? No happening . I think you 're worried that you caught a glimpse into your own future . Oh , those painkillers are making you loopy , old boy . Oh , no , I 'm not on any painkillers . And then your stuff didn 't come from home , so you feel uprooted and last week , you imagined reconnecting to an old girlfriend . In my defense , I do have a lot of those dreams . [ Laughter ] Yeah . You don 't have to miss out on having a real life like I did . I 'd be honored to have a life like yours . I 'd be honored if you 'd try for a little more . Dude , you look like Bantha poodoo . Well , as you can see , I feel fantastic . Spread the word to your teammates . Stop drinking those dumb energy drinks . And I need your help . Why ? What 's wrong with- - no , just trust me . The bottling plant , you said it was closing down . Why ? I don 't know . It 's some kind of deal to sell it off or something . Talk to me more about that . I found some tea . Why don 't you people have soup ? I mean , everybody has soup . We 're weird . Surgery was fun , huh ? You got some moves with that knife . Hey . Want to get dinner ? Or coffee . Pastries . The hardware store has a candy aisle . We 're not going out . We could stay inside . I heard the hardware store delivers candy . Look , my ex , it turns out he 's a giant tool box and I moved to a place where I couldn 't possibly meet any cute men , so- - a-ha ! You think I 'm cute . Pete , we 're not going out . Yeah , but you think I 'm cute . As you can see , there 's nothing dangerous in the drink . Well , do you collect test samples from every batch ? For safety purposes . It 's standard practice . Why ? That ladle . Is that what your people use to collect the samples ? I suppose . Myka , do you know Godfrid 's Spoon ? No . We looked for it at Warehouse 12 . Godfrid Haraldsson , a Viking Prince . It 's supposedly forged from the armor of fallen warriors . His men would drink from it before battle . It gave them strength . What are you talking about ? Mr. Russell , where did you get this ladle ? I don 't know . It 's always been here . Myka , this plant 's closing . Production moves to Naperville , Illinois , in three weeks . What 's in Naperville , Illinois ? Omnico Headquarters . They 're buying Boiling Point . Beaucoup bucks for the founder . That gives you motive to keep the deaths quiet until the deal goes through and it 's not your problem anymore . This belongs to me . Gerald , what are you doing ? You have no right to come in here . That ladle touches every batch of Boiling Point . Ruh-roh . You don 't have to answer their questions , Jeff . Mr. Russell , does Dr. Mahoney have stake in your company 's sale to Oomnico ? Gerald 's been with Boiling Point since the beginning . Jeff- - he must have a fortune in stock options by now . Jeff , shut up . Gerald , for God 's sakes , give them the ladle . No . Hey ! Hey ! No ! No ! What are you doing ? No , Claudia ! Grab Mahoney ! Gerald , what have you done ? He 's about to tell us right now . If Omnico finds out the drink is flawed , the sale doesn 't go through . What 's gonna happen to her ? The more you take in , the quicker it seems to take effect . And it 's seeping directly into her pores . I 'm afraid she 's not gonna last very long . I 'm sorry . None of this should have happened . The deal should have gone through weeks ago , then everything just got out of hand . You knew . You knew what we were putting out there could- - you killed Coach Tappon . Is it warm in here or am I wearing 38 snuggles ? Those boys only died because they drank too much . It was never safe . You just thought you could get away before anyone noticed . I didn 't know how it worked . How long does she have ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry . Based on how quickly she 's reacting , I 'd guess an hour , maybe two . We have to act quickly . I 'm not letting anyone else get hurt by this . What do we do ? Amino acids . The amino acids may have made contact with the metal and amped up the powers of the original ladle . I did a lot of research on the subject of amino acids for Dr. Moreau . Let me have a look . Perhaps I can cobble together an antidote . But that was 115 years ago . I doubt amino acids have changed a great deal since then . Hey ! You 're going to take Agent Wells to your lab and you are going to assist her now . I didn 't want any of this . Then this is your lucky day , Gerald . Because we 're giving you a chance to get it all sorted . Come on . Okay , I need something that slows down the burning process . I 'll put something together . Okay . Any change ? No , she 's burning up . I 'm fighting a losing battle . She doesn 't have much time . I hope you have something . I hope so too . Claudia , I 'm afraid this won 't taste very good . I know one mission won 't change your mind . I 'm not expecting miracles overnight . Just keep an open mind . [ Gasps ] [ Coughs ] Hey , you . How do you feel ? Did I combust ? No . If that guy made me combust , I 'm gonna be pissed . Oh , thank God . Here , let 's just set you up . [ Groans ] That 's easy for u to say . Ooh . Okay ? You should really thank H.G. She- - U were being wheeled out- - okay , I don 't care if I 'm having a brain transplant ! If you cross paths with H.G. Wells , you yank me out of anesthesia and you fill me in . Is that understood ? I 'm really glad she showed up . She saved my life . Mine too . Yeah , well , MacPherson saved my life countless times . It didn 't change who he was . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Crystal clear . Ah ! Artie , are you- - whoa , whoa . Good work on the ladle . Yeah , yeah . And I think I 'm gonna go to bed . Apparently falling into a vat of bubbling poison kind of takes it out of you . Uh , Claudia , wait . I have something for you . College admissions for South Dakota University . There 's some online courses in there too . So why the parental shove ? Well , you need a college degree to apply for the Secret Service . Right . Right . Okay . Um ... Thanks for being so hard on me out there . Turns out , you can take it . So I 'm gonna go back to the Warehouse . Do you want to come ? No , no , no . I , uh--I got a date with ... Kelly possibly . Yeah . Oh , I thought she turned you down . Oh , no , no , no . She did . She did . I just figured , you know , sometimes people can surprise you . Yeah , I guess sometimes they do .

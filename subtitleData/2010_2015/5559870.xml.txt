 crossing dimensions of time and space technology beyond comprehension they are watching day weighty for not having nightmares just got to be real they are already here thing down Aldergrove British Columbia located in the first hell Fraser Valley it 's an average working-class town where everyday life is simple and good of I 'm has been skycap then I decided that I wanted a better life acquired by from my children somewhere where I felt they would be safe song decided to look at all the grouping don 't the 19th July 17th 1991 started just like any other the kids going bad they were sleep and I had a friend who came to visit me good he 'd actually talked about marriage at that point him you and i cant with quite warm so we decide to go outside on the back patio just two to have it. out there nice beautiful you know summer night inflate up nice out here from your scallop potatoes earn adelante access the cream and I remember all this and feeling the strange coming in my abdomen Citi Field he said yes I was gonna ask you if you found that okay what is that that 's what and I said the cap time law this things about by the football field if not bigger with clocked and I see that because the only way that you could see the exact shape perfect was that it blocked out the stars that 's crazy there were no lights no sound and it was just floating along and then it stopped dead on a dime felt claustrophobic and yes it was it can if talk coming down he can handle it this is dangerous she goes much go inside I 'm outta here I 'm going inside you better come in my feet he ran inside I state there to me it felt like maybe two minutes three minutes at the most and I was just watching it and then it was never in any one thing AR he just said where have you been you go have looked all over for you you 've been gone for quite a while have been right here I 'm watching whatever this is I came out with the TA left I said I didn 't go anywhere but he talked over four and one in the words I went to the end of the driveway trying to find now I say I was outside just for a few minutes and he said no you 've been gone over forty five minutes I said that 's impossible time I 've been standing right here looking at but whatever that was in the sky a friend coming year was only have two to three minutes I think you just a normal nervous about this thing you saw and he said no he said look at the clock should stick around because the kids be by themselves while you were gone you 've been gone almost an hour 45 minutes deciding on what to think he just disappeared there 's no explanation I 've been standing here the whole time Tom time he went inside your city gets down this texting hearing act is just not doesn 't work Tom I had no idea where it then after that happened he never came back again I got a phone call I 'm sorry goodbye here some and thank came while when we do this now what we witnessed with this huge hearing she shit he was probably over the side of football field big and who to a tarp you not sure you wanna contact somebody and tell them about it because you don 't want to be ridiculed but things didn 't matchup things went right and the next day I contacted the planetarium in Vancouver said did you get any other cause and they said no bank I 'll put you in touch with Vancouver UFO Vancouver BC and didn 't even realize there was such a thing investigators from the UFO reporting centre in British Columbia take Karina 's case you for investigators shoulder at feelers fifteen other reports that night self similar objects have gone through the records fearful BC hands we 've had about heats argue for reports have rank she crack it just confirmed that what we had seen was not imaginary did was there really was something because there 'd been another eyewitness reports that name is interstellar travel possible astrophysicist doctor G Matthews is the mission scientist in charge of Canada 's first Space Telescope ok I think it 's important to keep in mind that the distances between stars are so vast that if you 're traveling in the conventional sense and if you 're restricted by the the universal speed limit the speed of light three hundred thousand kilometers per second to high-speed but even at that incredible pace it takes three years to cross the distance between with numerous neighboring stars are fast two space probes would take tens of thousands over the years to reach the nearest neighboring star so if if people had a real intuition for interstellar distances they would probably think more carefully about how likely it is billions are are traversing those distances to visit us on how often they 've to not saying it 's impossible but it 's not as easy as it looks what if interstellar travel isn 't the only way aliens visit earth you know maybe if we have visitors they 're not coming from another place in our three-dimensional spatial universe maybe they 're coming from another Saturday dimensions with them a much larger multiverse and their could be many many dimensions of space and time which our three spatial dimensions on r1 temporal dimension or just a subset of them but if you 're going to connect across dimensions the you you need to somehow tear a hole and within the geometry this creatures have found a way to do this and then they have developed a very sophisticated technology if it 's happening by accident they found some natural phenomena that that we have not yet encountered ok I didn 't want to believe I realized that there was something very strange happening I 'm there 's one two three a year that really stand out I like the one Karina really you know demand more attention is giant boomerang shape attack craft a flew over them I 'm before that happened on the everything went quiet all the frog stock croaking and its silence 45 minutes or an hour had gone by that was unaccounted for she doesn 't recall what happened with them the same time so where was she I 'm not sure what happened what took place am in July 1991 a massive objects hovers over Karina Sables house in Aldergrove BC screens Karina learns that she disappeared for more than 45 minutes missing time she can 't account for ER Behance I 'm time I 've been standing right here looking at but whatever that was in the sky for an hour an hour okay this is really weird because this now makes me think of what happened as a child didn 't really know what name to put to it what it was of killed well he was in October close to Halloween and no friend to come over and they send you know come out with us we can complain their in a forest up okay like somebody suggested we play hiding seek when it came time to for my turn you know to kinda hide up against a tree and try and find everyone else why for 6 Sen thank you here then there was no sound I can hear the children I could I can see them dies why all in the Sun it was plagued strange musty smell came around me campanella meet and it was like shivers and then the next thing I know pain I 've affect the sphere inside of me I 'm just terrified mom ID I don 't dare look back to what following the fight I know something 's time funny I reached my home and everybody 's panicking my parents are crying in you know they 're screaming have you been are the kids have been back for a long time where were you to this day I have no idea when as well as what happened but I know that there was time missing there 's an enormous number of sightings where there 's missing time involved where where people don 't remember what happened to them directly after this two or three hour gap in their life so up this is typical abductees so at that time he just explained that a texan Eunos when they come and they would take these people and they do things them and they were sometimes return from a production offense with unusual marks and scars and bruises on her body key word here scars the return with fully formed scars that were not there the day before and that is biologically impossible in SF summit that 's going to make sense now because I would wake up and I would have certain marks on my body 26 phone you know some people who claim they 've been adapted home have what we call the school so it 's it can be on your leg or somewhere else on your body since I was a chance I 've had a mark on my leg I don 't know where it came from I mean I never really understood what was going on when inside doctor and I asked him to check in with Tony but he thought it was he didn 't really come up with a specific answer is the unexplained mark evidence Avana production experience I 'm definitely you question yourself I never have taken any drugs I didn 't drink I still don 't you feel absolutely in for the long because you don 't know just couldn 't believe me I mean if I was listening to someone else at that time he said I don 't know if I should believe this over the next few weeks Carino tries to put the sighting behind her I 'm I had put the children to bed and I went to bed myself and I just you know close my eyes I 'll my I 'm you and of haunted by mysterious gaps in her life and unexplained marks on her body Carino fears she may have been abducted by aliens weeks after witnessing a large object hovering over her house in Aldergrove British Columbia things take a nightmarish heard what I saw literally be about three feet tall I guess pear shaped head kinda grayish color I felt terrified there was a feeling offense that I 've seen him before wasn 't positive Sabathia image like you would be there and then it image would appear send a pic and find everything from it so I don 't know how else to describe it was kinda floating into for free it 's here it 's gonna be here if I come in here but there was nothing and my daughter was asleep so i thought i hope i here we go have had a bad dream seriously thought of putting myself in a psych ward when these things happen first thing I think I 've is my children how can I protect them how can I stop on this down a mental emotional and spiritual level you begin to question everything has brought up Catholic from the Scottish this this tattoo Nandana Sen mom who are we were really from who are the speakeasy and what is it all about why are we here while and then you feel absolutely and totally loans doctor king sure runs the astrobiology Center at Columbia University looking for clues as to whether or not there 's life beyond birth my we are trying very very hard modern science today to you to find out whether or not we are genuinely alone in our solar system or alone in the universe as a whole some two very recently just didn 't know for sure or that there are other planets around other stars with modern technology we 've been able to eek out the signatures planets around other stars the fact that there are so many planets out there these quite surprising because it means that planets form incredibly efficiently in this galaxy and probably in the universe as a whole and that means that the opportunity for the to be plan it 's a bit like the earth all somehow similar enough too hard a life goes up enormously I think we 're sitting at 763 confirmed planets and more than 2,000 candidate planets galaxy is packed with plants more planets them stars we didn 't know that a few years ago and among those planets are a huge number of smaller planets maybe rocky terrestrial I plant be like the earth well Goldilocks zone which is sometimes called the habitable zone is the region around a star way and if you placed planet like the earth that has possibility of having a surface temperature somewhere between the freezing point in the boiling point of water in other words at the right distance from the start to be kept at a nice temperature then the reason we 're so interested in planet that can have liquid water on its surface is that might count exist without water liquid form I if you think about it of all the oxygen that we brief essentially comes from plants and microorganisms and a lot of the chemistry above our planet has been determined over four billion years of evolution by the microbial organisms living hip when we look at alien worlds what we 're really looking for % uh the signatures a that kind of life were looking for environmental klutz life is playing a role in what happens on the surface with that plan obviously you make a lot of assumptions when we talk about things like Goldilocks zone need for water because we 're spinning that life out there somehow like life here is that right we don 't know Justin the real answer but we need to start somewhere and the best way to begin is to use what you know as a template in the search for new things up for more what 's this up of like the white ghost who are these beans and and what is that all about shaking scant okay sweetie who 's that and then Mike daughters its I don 't like the pumpkin head manner 1 he said that he 's the doctor deduct am really scared of him because he hurts me some Paul Singh said after discovering for daughter has been painting disturbing images Karina Sables is convinced something has been visiting her daughter 's room in Aldergrove British Columbia our perception a valence and in in writing and film and television is all governed by our perception of ourselves and so we tried to have wild extrapolations but really we can 't because we have only one example of complex life here on earth alien life may not look so different from us may have two arms two legs two eyes and song because that is a natural solution the problem of having a functioning organisms life hostile subscribe to the same rules the governess here the laws of physics the laws of chemistry and biochemistry and so on but how they manifest themselves you know how you go from simple organisms to complex organisms it and it seems logical to us based on what we know about life here was a okay all they gotta have like 2i stereoscopic vision they kinda they should have to lay eggs to balance themselves or whatever but who knows the other side of the coin is the evolution is a much more random process in which case could be alien life out there handsome resemblance tell us what so ever but it senses things that moves it thinks but it does it in a very very different way that too is is a valid viewpoint we just don 't know yet which way its gonna give every time that we have had the capability of looking at the universe in different ways to open our eyes to new regions a wavelength the electromagnetic spectrum our new time scales are new distances be been surprise good I 'll up of like car you ok when my daughter minded up tie me about the doctors it definitely brought me back to work really happen to know the girl and all the Sun all these pieces are the possible being put together said on I 'm I remember it being take a nap in a very very large shipped from like a better word it was gigantic room and it was round home it wasn 't like very well was subdued lighting it had a strange smell in the air very cold and I would just be placed on this stainless steel table and although the Sun to my left call being very bony structure started approaching he had a huge head and it was kind of like month moonstruck chicken head me large black woman she I is licks her mouth no nos to speaker no years home very scrawny little body and I remember feeling terrified you can say lets you just heard in my mind said I 'm the doctor I 'm it was almost like what 's he going to do to me doctor david jacobs has spent 25 years researching the abduction phenomenon a typical duction advance is a person 's taken out at the moment by moment there then place on on this table and they have an examination of sorts by and ice if source because it 's not a normal country examination routinely sperm steak and eggs are posted is another room that was there and in this particular place you could see hundreds of what look like the crimes and parties fetuses morning and I remember thinking goodnight and realized that they 're coming implanting women in the comeback in the freemen fetuses from us and this is where for truly all same the cold is a production of these hybrid human looking beings cross routine alien human it became very clear about what 's going on I always seem to have female type problems and down my mother had them a smile week be pregnant and then home we will no longer be pregnant we have miscarriages but never actually found a fetus on story I and that 's when I we can make this is this is going from generation to generation if you work with an abductee there 's almost a certainty vataa either their mother or father or both 3 abductees now if that 's the case and it is a generational it also means that works the other way means that the children will be abductees I think the worst thing was there realizing that this was really real you know that that was terrifying I was getting angry I didn 't want to believe this how do we get away from them I can thank you how can I stop on this I have to do something to protect my daughters 891 something happening to her looking for a safe haven from the haunting experiences in Aldergrove British Columbia Karina singles picks up and moves her family to the heart up the Okanagan Valley one morning I just woke up and something told me grab some boxes you 're moving and I can 't explain it he had the way I know it sounds silly but that 's the way it sounds and for the next 12 years katrina and her daughter find peace come on is lying the USS California very warm weather semi-desert summers are great showing girlfriend of mine a command from Vancouver to visit them you about like fact indicator something who 's quite neat and she was leaving the next morning yes you to get access second she said to me when we go stargazing but I think it 's really need I don 't think we 're gonna do this now she was so insistent thats eventually I just give in and says a pick-up home gone stargazing since probably since last time I saw me so much there was no that night and the street lights where we ended up going at least pitch black and beautiful stars outside pulled over on the bright side we park this a break poets K think lines yes and have gotten a million-and-a-half candlelight checking for bears and cougars because they have had sightings in that area recently its nice out yes 0 hi okay that 's really where right away she said there 's like 3 pinpoints like stars from the sky me communique in a trying to hurt him creating rooms airplanes don t there helicopter Sunday that something 's going on they 're moving in I turned on my likes tix on the square home my first saw the eyes I thought okay it 's dear and then reality checked in at No no the sarcastic yes the something else and once I realized what they were it then I really can act I tried yelling and my voice come I think it was I 'm so terrified that I couldn 't speak I can breathe and I 'm trying to challenge to get back Park I 'm trying to get back to my door but it 's like I 'm going in slow motion and I 'm walking in quicksand by things can happen I know it 's going to come and get me to get away by yes it did even work if the upcoming bus by half I don 't believe what just happened going home with its me and then we just headed back towards town of to get off of said I can 't go home I can 't take these things to my daughter I said I don 't want something happening with her I said we have to keep going we 're gonna go park somewhere and wait till this thing needs that went down the road further up the mountain where all the sport shirts are 22k should so we look to the back for the car to see if it was we could see it through them back when shell we could see it your and it was it was about us it was about the vehicle Hey after this week feeling like I 'm of you on wall and Emma Tricity that if the hair on my on my body standing was going to clock KY same house saying oh my gosh eisenhower she mentions to me this an hour 's missing time and we just got there how can it be that in our smithing plays an hour of play said share everything seems fine when my daughter was asleep but deep inside me some other party for me understood that there was nothing I could do to stop these things from coming three points like their stars but the wrong thing on July 27th 2003 Karina Sables and her friend experience the terrified close encounter with him this but fearing for her daughter 's safety Karina races home only to discover much to her relief all swell Karina immediately reports the incident to UFO investigators in British Columbia and she learns from you if I would just Brian flake the key and her friend arms the first to report the sighting you had over 200 witnesses for one event attracted to place on the 27th of 2003 July 2003 it was an amazing event the phone never stopped what he said was we 've had a lot more home siding seeing people life I witness reports home we have people calling us with people emailing us with the same things that you 've seen he saw the screen now lights have going around the sky and hovering and going back and forth and then up and down and then shooting off into into the distant it was incredible the object ended up I 'm coming over the mountain did 90-degree turns dropdown over lakes it did another 90 degree in turned up drowned when overtopping people 's vehicles on the highway it was Bazaar I 'll and doctor down stein 's studies atmospheric phenomena that are sometimes mistaken for unidentified flying objects the meteor is small number material that has come loose in the solar system thus become downed to both by gravity and plummeting to earth because it doesn 't have enough speed to keep the north as a plummets to us that eventually interact with the atmosphere and burdensome in many senses what 's happening is virtually meteorite issue operating officer visit the meteorite because the friction between this very very high speed flying object and an atmosphere friction heat it up evaporates materials of the meteorite and it leaves the mean streak behind me. of behind that you very often see a green streak them so you see the meteorite hit pave white street behind it and then agreement so and then then eventually doctors and that 'll always been pretty much a straight line crew knows what highlighted ones how low it was where there was a large fragment or small fragment low-down 0 Brittany meteorite fragment would be illuminated by the light from the energy and the meteorite and but Kareena and her friends are more than one neon light in the sky that evening there were three of them and that they were position in a triangle formation and kind of going around moving in strange directions some skeptics wanna say while you know if read this it could be that at Hoover fully awake lotsa by witnesses it was so fast it was unbelievable the next morning Karina suffers from a massive headache I 'm just sitting there trying to figure out what happened the night before morning Shirley my friend gets out and she said you know I really don 't feel well this morning she said something 's wrong she myspace I don 't feel well Hong United the head it too just feel like there 's something wrong heady excitement last night me sure way show my nose is bleeding only car ok old sweet knows he 's got a bleeding nose like i 've seen leading noses before it was quite intense she says you know something 's wrong she said after paying down my back got I back essentially really hurts I can only do you think springs or something she 's certainly burn the fat burner attack and it was big circular what looks like a realization burn oh my god it really hurts how much I don 't know really hurts saying sup makes you look awful having a throw up okay sneaky Mike abuses my daughter says you know him so I think I 've got the flu or something I really fact throwing up and then colonel starts bleeding now an okay this is not your morning with Hey it hit me like a ton of bricks and I 'm no matter what I did to try and keep them away they still got to her they got to my daughter that 's why she has a she also has a bleeding nose and there was nothing I could do no matter where we thank her how far we would go they would always find us for Karina the recent experience confirms her worst fears the last experience left me pretty rhine open again down to to remind me that they are in control that they can still come and do what they want and there 's nothing you can do about it I can 't stop them uniting plants or how far we would go they would always find us by of you know have that these leave very unusual lives they know that whole series a bizarre things fixed be live in fear it 's going to continue to happen stay up awake all night long a lot of people can 't go to sleep it all without the TV on without lights are on some people can 't go to sleep without my for a gun underneath her pillow so I wish more people would come forward to say that their abductees we need to do it on mass I 'm not here to try and improve I make people believe that be something beyond the sex really happened you can 't miss let this consume you because if you do not survive if I 'm fifty-something and I 'm still here then probably not gonna kill me me take me again but I still come back and I may not be able to protect my children on but people watched me and because it 's the way they have handled things they are better able to handle but possibly will happen with their own children prepare children down the road knows we 're not sure why do you keep coming back but they do come back only

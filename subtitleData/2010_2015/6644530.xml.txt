It 's quickly closing in on our position . It 's a Gauna pod . How many cores are there ? We 're estimating approximately 200 cores . 000 times the size of Sidonia . It 's massive . 000 times ? I 've never seen anything like it . That 's the Gauna ? The reports from observation are in . 326 ) \ b1 } Sidonia It engulfed an asteroid inside its Ena . It 's going to collide with us ! Gauna 542 is on collision course with Sidonia ! It can 't be ! It would obliterate us . Display acceleration level . Here is our current relative acceleration and our range of trajectories . Permission to perform emergency diagonal acceleration at thrust level two . Granted . Attention citizens . This is a gravity warning . Remain indoors and prepare for emergency acceleration . You are advised to identify the locations of the nearest safety rails and be prepared to use your gravity belt without advance notice . Once again ... citizens . This is a gravity warning . Remain indoors and prepare for emergency acceleration . This is the ERD . Chief . Gauna 542 is closing in . How is Ena Hoshijiro doing ? It 's still looking towards the Kabizashi storage area . and now they 're attacking Sidonia again . 560 ) \ b1 } Live It 's true that the Gauna are drawn to the Kabizashi . However ... Getting rid of the Kabizashi won 't eliminate the danger of a Gauna attack . It 's too soon to draw conclusions . Keep an eye on our subject during the battle . understood . Ready thruster one . Ignition . 555 ) } Thruster 1 Ignition I think we should find shelter just in case . It won 't matter where we go if we get hit by an asteroid . 493 ) } Deployment Order Ready thruster two . Ignition . Turning from Gauna 542 's collision course trajectory . Stop acceleration . Cut the thrusters now . Thrusters offline . Switching to cruise control . There are no reports of casualties from the residential district . 240 ) } Warning 285 ) } Warning Gauna 542 is changing course ! It 's returned to a collision course with Sidonia ! Warning Can 't be . How can it be so agile ? The posterior Gauna pods have created a propulsion system ! it 's impossible to escape Gauna 542 's trajectory ! How long until impact ? 418 ) } Gauna 542 impact in : Six hours ! Destroy it along with the asteroid . We 're going to use an Inter-Planetary missile ! Prepare to launch ! it 's either been evaded right before impact or neutralized with an intercepting attack . We won 't make it if we don 't fire . The Gardes will immobilize it before the impact ! permission to use the prototype weapon . Granted . Equip all dispatching Gardes with them . Orders are to bring out the ballistic drivers and core-penetration rounds ! What ? All of them ? all 48 ! In this short amount of time ? You know we can 't make all those adjustments . We 'll have to make do . Go on and send them out as soon as you have the recoil control system and rear thrusters removed . prepare for sequential launch ! I didn 't know we had so many of those prototype weapons finished . Target : asteroid approaching Sidonia . Aligning trajectory . 1.05 million kilometers . 460 ) } Target Locked Correcting for missile angle . Preparation complete ! Fire ! IPM ready ! Fire ! This is squad one leader Samari . Prepare for clutch formation ! This is squad two leader . Copy that ! Roger ! Clutch formation ! Two hours until IPM makes impact ! This is Samari . Garde clutch formation : condition good . No issues with current trajectory . Central Command to Garde squads . This is your mission objective . The Garde squads must destroy Gauna 542 before the IPM impacts the asteroid . 548 ) } Interplanetary Missile impact in : Affirmative ! There was a man that saved Sidonia from danger time after time . Sidonia is facing grave danger . their giant nest . We need another hero to save us . So I am now asking for your help . But ... I really love Sidonia . All the great food and all the people that are here living happily together . but I will do everything I can to protect Sidonia . And its people . Because I 'm a Knight of Sidonia ! If it weren 't for the Gauna ... There 's an IPM coming straight for where we are . And we 're fighting on an asteroid with gravity . Fighting with gravity carrying these around . That 's going to drop our survival rate . They have updated the recoil control system from before . We finally have a way to attack the Gauna from range without having to remove their Ena first . But we haven 't trained with it yet . concentrate on the mission . Get ready to decelerate . Rotate your units and prepare your reverse thrusters ! Tsugumori . It should have been me . I should 've piloted it . 000 kilometers from the target . We 've matched the target 's relative velocity . Stop deceleration ! It 's so big . What the hell is this ? How are we supposed to fight this ? We don 't have a choice . 640 ) } 100 Sights of Sidonia : Residential Tower Topmost Section 640 ) } 100 Sights of Sidonia : An alley near Kuntao Development It 's so big . 340 ) } Gauna 542 336 ) } Sidonia 430 ) } Garde Clutch Formation Release clutch formation ! 372 ) } Squad 1 569 ) } Squad 2 enter orbital trajectory !

I need help ! Unit 639 down ! Don 't fire ! Concentrate on dodging the shots ! They 're sitting ducks out there . drop down to the surface and dodge the Heigus cannon fire . You actually wanna drop altitude in this gravity ? It will be less intense near the surface ! follow me ! I 'm getting pulled down ! purge gun-barrel extensions . you still have your gun-barrel extension attached ! Detach it now ! It 's too heavy ! I can 't stabilize ! Look out ! Units 561 and 342 lost ! What about squad two ? Assessing damage to Gauna propulsion core . Twenty ... Thirty ... It 's over 35 % . 574 ) } Live we got another one . Now . Over 70 % destroyed ! I think we have enough core-penetration rounds left ! And we can still use the Heigus particle cannons . Over 90 % destroyed ! Squad Two ! Status update !

Another eight units lost ! We 've lost over 20 units ! Fall back ! Get out of there ! 261 and 325 lost ! We 've just lost the signals . We 've lost all communication with squad two units ! They 're all gone ? This is squad one ! We 're running low on core-penetration rounds ! We can 't destroy the core on our own ! Squad one is down to 14 units ! One hour remaining until IPM impact ! 1800 ) } Interplanetary Missile impact in : Continue the mission . What now ? What can we do with what we have left ? I need your help . IPM making final trajectory adjustments . Adjust 0.35 degrees . An hour left . there 's no hope to destroy each Gauna . 150 ) \ frz8.595 } Gauna 542 Analysis So we have to destroy the host core instead . There are many empty chambers within Gauna 542 . So ... Prepare the Heigus particle cannon ! What ? there 's a chance we can rip a hole in its Ena ! { \ cH00FFFF } Prepare Heigus cannon for barrage on Gauna 542 anterior ... we won 't be able to make any course changes if we fail ! { \ cH00FFFF } Prepare Heigus cannon for barrage on Gauna 542 anterior ... the residential district will ... { \ cH00FFFF } Prepare Heigus cannon for barrage on Gauna 542 anterior ... the residential district will ... It won 't matter if we lose Sidonia . Do it . Affirmative ! Squad one ! Sidonia will soon fire a high-energy Heigus cannon shot at Gauna 542 to blast a hole in its Ena . and destroy it ! What ? Inside it ? 292 ) } Gauna 542 354 ) } Squad 1 400 ) } Asteroid 404 ) } Propulsion 514 ) } Host Core We 're seriously going inside this thing ? We have no choice ! Samari . We copy . We will destroy the host core ! Brace for the shockwave ! Affirmative ! Prepare the Heigus particle cannon ! Begin supercharge cycle ! Use emergency protocol to close the mainline Heigus circuits and divert them to the central distributor ! 200 ) } Map of Sidonia This is an emergency announcement .

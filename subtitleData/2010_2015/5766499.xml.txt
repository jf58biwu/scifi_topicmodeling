 I quit ! RACHEL : Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of ourjets . ALISON : I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now . I 'd like you to take over as interim director . The disease is spreading too rapidly . But if we can reboot her immune system ... SARAH : With my kid 's bone marrow ? For the embryos . My father is the father . I 'm carrying your babies . You had to put your own child inside of her ? ( GRUNTS ) HENRIK : Don 't do this . Helena ! We 're not safe here . Where are you gonna take her ? - ( GRUNTS ) - Pleasure to meet you , Felix . - What have you done ? - ( WHIMPERS ) I know how frightening this must be for you . You may even grow to like it here . Just as I did . MAN : Do you have any known allergies ? Are you taking any prescription or medication ? In the first place , giving the bone marrow of a child . She 's eight years old ... ( INDISTINCT ARGUING ) ( WHISPERING ) I should have known . I should have seen it . She is eight years old , she doesn " t get a choice in any of this . MAN : What is your sexual orientation ? Do you now or have you ever used intravenous drugs ? Any sexual partners ? - Are you ovulating ? - I don 't know . - Are you ovulating ? - I don 't know ! ( INDISTINCT ARGUING CONTINUES ) Five bloody minutes ... - You cannot come over again ... - ( SIGHS ) ... and again , Sarah . I thought it was you . She looked like you , she ... ( STUTTERS ) ( SIGHS ) MAN : When did you first have sexual intercourse ? Fourteen ... Fifteen . - Have you ever had an STD ? - No . Have you ever been diagnosed with a reproductive disorder ? No . Have you ever had an abortion ? Have you ever had an abortion ? ( VOICE BREAKING ) Yeah . Have you ever been diagnosed with mental illness ? No . Do you use birth control ? Sometimes , yeah . MRS S : Be strong , child . I don 't know whose side you 're on , but I know you always put Kira first . And we 'll do that now . But first , we need to get Felix checked by a doctor . Felix . ( EXHALES ) - Felix , honey , you ... - ( SNIFFLES ) We have to get you for the toxicology test . No , not a chance . I 'm fine . No . No , love , we can 't be sure what you 've had ... We don 't know ... Sarah , you better tell ... Sarah ? - My name is Sarah Manning . - MAN : Speak up , please . My name is Sarah Manning . And this is my unconditional surrender . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOOR OPENING ) Good morning , Miss Manning . My name is Dr Nealon . ( RECORDER BEEPS ) Nice to see you again . " Again " ? At our first encounter , I thought you were Beth Childs . Blood work told us otherwise . You examined me in my sleep ? I 'm glad that will no longer be necessary . You began menstruation very young . Look , I 'm gonna cooperate , but I wanna see my kid . Kira 's fine . ( SNIFFS ) You have my word . ( SIGHS ) Come on , honey . It won 't hurt , it 'sjust cotton . Mmm-mmm . Please ? ( SIGHS ) There . All done . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) ( LINE RINGING ) CAL : Hello ? Hey ! You can 't take that . Hey ! We just finished processing that materia * I , Martin . And your transplant is being booked . The marrow 's being sent directly to Dr Nealon . - What ? Who 's Dr Nealon ? - Your new physician . What ? I have a new physician ? Dr Cormier didn 't tell you ? This is all on Rachel 's orders . Effective immediately , you 'll no longer be working with clones . ( WHISPERS ) Frankfurt . And if I refuse ? You will be on the plane . You have everything you wanted . Everything Dyad wanted . You used me . - ( SIGHS ) - Please . Let me say goodbye to Cosima . Cosima will be well-cared for . - And Sarah 's procedure is imminent . - ( ELEVATOR CHIMES ) You forget , Dr Cormier , none of this is personal . DELPHINE : I love her . And if you let her die without me , it is personal . ( KEYPAD BEEPING ) SCOTT : No one 's more familiar with her illness than Delphine . We need her . Dr Nealon has all of Dr Cormier 's records . She 'll get the best possible care . She had the best care . You took it away . MARTIN : This is not a debate , Mr Smith . If you wish to remain involved ... ( STUTTERS ) Uh ... Martin ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( CHUCKLES ) Look , I just ... Can you tell Dr Nealon that I am really excited to work with him ? Um ... Is there anything that I can do for Sarah ? I ... ljust don 't want anybody to get hurt . Maybe if I can 't see Sarah , then I can see Kira ? You know , she 's just a little kid , and it 'll be a nice gesture from you guys ... You know , we can ... Foster cooperation . I 'll see what I can do . Awesome . Thank you . What are you up to ? I don 't know yet . Cosima , you should really leave . Yeah , I know . I probably should . But they 're planning something for Sarah . Delphine just sent me Rachel 's itinerary . So , we know where she 's gonna be ? And we know where Sarah 's gonna be . In 16 days , when you begin to ovulate , we would like to harvest your eggs . - You would ? - Yes . Well , I would like to see my daughter . DR NEALON : Sign consent for the procedure , and I will make that happen . Look at me . Do I really need to sign ? - Does that really matter ? - ( CLICKS TONGUE ) Bureaucracy . Now take me to her . KIRA : You want some tea ? Hello , sweetheart . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Are you comfortable ? Is my mum here yet ? ( SIGHS ) Soon . I hope . The last time I saw your mother , she laid hands on me . - Do you know what that means ? - No . It means she wasn 't very nice to me . And then she kept running away , just as she ran from you so many times . Did that make you sad ? Yeah . But she says she " s all grown up now . I hope she is . Even mothers have to do as they 're told sometimes . Don 't they ? MRS S : Absolutely not . What part of this are you not understanding ? No ... No , you listen . Amber alert is not an option . If I say you 're making a car bomb , you will bloody well make a car bomb . I 'll call you back . Who was that ? That was , uh ... That was nobody you need to know . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hey , Mrs S ? - Who are you ? - I 'm Cal . I 'm , uh ... Kira 's father . - Kira called me this morning . - MRS S : And when did she give you this ? FELIX : Oh , for Christ 's sake , Siobhan . I can vouch for him . After eight years , you finally meet Kira 's dad , you don 't even tell me . Oh , yes , let 's do open a rollicking debate about keeping secrets , shall we ? Guys , guys . Please , can you put the gun down ? Look , Sarah never told me anything , okay ? I just ... I just kind of figured it out . Genetic identicals . Kira knows it too , even though she doesn 't really know what it means . - ( SIGHS ) - I 'm here to help . I did a lot of digging on Dyad . - He 's handy that way . - Is he ? ( MOBILE PHONE RINGING ) ( SIGHS ) Arthur , what can you tell me ? ART : Well , I can tell you I just came home to find someone at my table . What do you mean ? Who ? She 's eating . Hello , sestra - brother . I want to see Sarah . Holy shit . - Helena 's back . - Do not tell her about Sarah . Art , have you told her anything ? No , of course not . I want you over there , Felix . She is too unpredictable . Hang on just a second . - Me ? - Yes , you . ( SIGHS ) Oh , God ! Just keep feeding her , Art . A * ll right ? I 'm gonna be there as soon as I can . - Yeah . - Bye . Just keep her on ice , c * lear ? Do not let Helena out of your sight . Okay . - Duncan . - Sarah . Don 't despair , my dear . Don 't despair . I fell in love with a boy ca * lled Jesse . But after bar fight , I think he had to go to war and become ... A tow truck driver . Okay . Okay , look , there was a fire at the Johanssen ranch last night . Do you know anything about that ? No . Helena . ( BLOWING RASPBERRIES ) Did you burn down the fish people 's ranch ? No . - When do I see Sarah ? - FELIX : Soon . She said that Kira can 't wait to see you . HELENA : After my heart was broken , I became roommates to a very good girl . Okay . So tell me about that . ( SIGHS ) She had ... A crisis of faith . MARK : What 's done is done , Gracie . We can start afresh . Am I a sinner for wishing my father dead ? He deserved it . God 's just gonna have to deal with the both of us then , isn 't he ? Yes , he wi * l * I. Because we 're together now . That means the child inside you , too . ( CHUCKLES ) Dyad group has these key people on dozens of corporate boards , you know . I 'm talking super packs and research groups and lobbyists . All a concerted effort to try and effect biogenetic patent law . - Mmm-hmm . - I can use the Internet actually , Cal . ( CHUCKLES ) No , you can 't . No offence . Well , what have you discovered ? Oh , it 's not " what " , it 's " who " . Someone from Dyad tried to hack me , so I ... I hacked him back . I followed this person on Darknet , and I saw him asking the same questions as me . Jesus , you fel * I for that ? But they had real information . Project leader , clones . And they know I 'm Kira 's father . I think this is an insider . And high up too . They get to you , they get to Kira . They already have Kira . And yet , this person is still here . They 're there now ? - ' ' Can you help ? ' ' - ( KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING ) ( INHALES SHARPLY ) ( WHISPERS ) Oh , come on . Just ... Tell him you 're with Siobhan Sadler . - " With Siovan ... " - It 's with a B-H . - Oops . - ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) Sorry about that . ( WHISPERING ) Come on . ( BEEP ) " Castor " ? Does that mean anything to you ? Don 't know your mythology , do you , Cal ? Luckily you 're not the only person with an inside man . ( SHUTTER DOOR OPENS ) Well ... I didn 't peg you for a Major back in Professor Duncan 's house . I wasn 't . A lot has changed since I came back in . But you are still prepared to play double agent . Like you , I wanna know the truth . I 'm impressed , Paul . I 'll be impressed if you can actually pull this off . Cup of tea while we wait ? Suddenly , I heard a thud and a hissing behind me and looking round , sprang to my feet with a cry of horror . Against the warm dawn great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure ... RACHEL : Are you enjoying yourself ? ... shot flickering threads of blood-red ... . I 've brought tea . Just hot water for me . I brought my own bag . - Do you remember this day ? - As often as possible . It 's the day I would have never seen had it not been for your synthetic sequences . And yet , Martin tells me you 've encoded them with a non-repeating substitution cipher . Why would you deny existence to more of us ? We 're your life 's work . I 've given you the sequence to help Cosima . Cure her , and we 'll talk about unlocking another . Unlock another , and we 'll talk about curing Cosima . Well , since none of us seem to know what you 're actually for , I think your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure . I want the key to your cipher . I 've had 20 years to work on it . It 's rather good . - RACHEL : Where is it ? - ( SWALLOWS ) Is it with Sarah 's people ? My dear , I didn 't write it down . You know , I can recite Pi to 6,000 places . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) Do you recall , Rachel , not the memory , but the feeling of ... how much we loved you ? ( INAUDIBLE ) The reason I watch these tapes so often is because I don 't remember at all . ( CHOKING ) ( SHATTERS ) What have ... What have you done ? What have you done ? - ( GROANS ) My poor , poor Rachel . - No ! - My poor , poor Rachel . - Why ? No ! ( STAMMERS ) It won 't take long . No , no , no . No , you can 't leave me again . You can 't leave me again ! No ! I 'm afraid you don 't deserve me any more . ( CHOKES ) Martin ! ( BOTH LAUGHING ) So you know what I need , if this gets Sarah out of there . I 'm well aware . This should be interesting . All right , they 're willing . Pau * I , meet Ca * I. He 's Kira 's father . Hi , Pau * I. ( CHUCKLES ) CAL : What 's so funny ? Ah , you 're a friend of Sarah 's . Just look at the two of you . I don 't know how she does it . Okay , what 's happening now ? We are hoping that there are still good people in the most corrupt places . You , the monitor , Pau * I Dierden . Yeah , I think I know who you are . Apparently we 're both willing to risk our necks to get to the bottom of this . Hmm ? Castor . You guarantee that Sarah and her daughter will be released and protected . I can get them out . The rest is up to Sarah . COSIMA : You like your new dolls , Kira ? KIRA : No , not really . No ? ( SIGHS ) ( COUGHS ) Um ... Do you wanna do some science ? - Science class ? - Yeah . COSIMA : It 's my favourite . Pure science . - You wanna do it ? Okay . - Yeah . ( SNIFFS ) We 're gonna do an experiment . I want you to try to push your favourite pencil through this paper . Okay ? See if you can do it . Oops . - How come that didn 't work , I wonder ? - ( GIGGLES ) 'Cause you know what ? You need more ... force . Okay ? So force equals mass times ... Peow ! Acceleration . How can we get the pencil through this paper , do you think ? We need to make it sharper ? That 's a really good idea . High-five for that . What about trying speed ? Maybe acceleration ? Should we give that a shot ? ( GRUNTS ) ( GASPS ) COSIMA : Nice one ! You won the experiment . You won science . - You 're a scientist now . - ( GIGGLES ) You wanna make , um , a picture for your mom ? Yeah . Okay . Maybe we can explain to her what we learned today . ( SNIFFS ) Hey . Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - Cosima ... - I 'm okay . I 'm okay . - Sorry . I 'm okay . - Cosima , it 's not going to work . It has to work . ( GRUNTS ) She needs us . Cosima . Hey . Hey ! Let me do this . Where 'd you get that ? We 're only gonna get one chance . ( DOOR OPENS ) What 's going on ? - Let go . Let go ! - ( MEN GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) What are you doing ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) SARAH : Why are you doing this ? - NURSE : Okay , here she comes . - ( SARAH GRUNTS ) NURSE : No , move that . Move that to the other side . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) MAN : Three , two , one . What are you gonna do ? MAN : Got it . Cosima says " Hey " . We 're gonna help you get out of here . Just ... What is this ? We 're performing an oophorectomy . A what ? We 're removing one of your ovaries . For research . Bullshit you are . - That 's not what I signed . - You 'll still have one . We don 't wish to render you infertile . On the contrary , I hope you look forward to another pregnancy as much as we do . Dr Nealon . SARAH : ( WHISPERS ) Shit . DR NEALON : Miss Duncan . I 'd like a second to speak to my sister , please . Two minutes . Everybody , stay prepped . NURSE : Okay , everybody out . ( MONITORS BEEPING ) Kira gave me something for you . ( WHISPERING ) You psycho . You also gave her bone marrow to cure Cosima . Duncan is dead . - What ? - He took his own life . But I know he gave you the key to the synthetic sequences , didn 't he ? What key ? To his cipher . He wrote them down for you . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Rachel , I don 't know . No ? Enjoy your oophorectomy . We 'll continue this when you 're done . Rachel . - I 'll tell you . - Good . Where is it ? Where has he written it ? Right here . ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMING ) Go ! Take Kira . Go ! ( GROANS ) ( BEEPING ) - Oh . - KIRA : Mommy . She 's ready . - I wasjust about to get you . - Come here . You 're free to go , you don 't have to run . I 'm very impressed by you , Sarah , by both you and your mother . Who are you ? My name is Marian Bowles . I 'm from Top Side . I 've opened the doors , but this does not end with Rachel . Sarah . If you ever wanna stop running , if you want the truth , if you wanna know what this is really all about , then you meet me tomorrow . Cal can arrange it . He " s downstairs waiting to take you home to your sisters . CAL : Well , tonight was certainly informative . - Give me five . - Later , Ca * I. - Take care . - Yeah , nice to meet you . ( WHISPERS ) He 's hot . ( EXHALES ) Well , that 's us . Yeah , it was , uh , a pretty standard group of sisters . - Yeah , I think so . - ( CHUCKLES ) Um , I 'm gonna be around , okay ? I wanna help with Kira , and getting the marrow and stuff . I don 't think we can do that again for another six weeks . Oh . ( SIGHS ) So I don 't know what 's gonna happen to Cosima . Um ... I 'm sorry about that . Whatever you did to get Marian Bowles , thank you for doing that . Don 't thank me , okay ? I 'm not doing this for thanks . I 'm doing it because I ... ( DOOR OPENS ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Oh , he * l * lo . Steamy potatoes . Hi . - Cal ? - Yeah . You 're not gonna be bringing all that game into my bed , I hope . - ( SNORTS ) - CAL : No , unfortunately not . It 's , um , clones only tonight . I know . That means me too . - See you later . - Bye . - Bye . - Bye . Listen , I don 't know if this is a good idea or not , because it 's crazy , but Art has someone downstairs who really wants to meet her sisters . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( CHUCKLES ) FELIX : Helena . ( SOFTLY ) Oh , my God . This is your sister Cosima . - COSIMA : Hey . - You should not be up . I 'm up . Come here . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're very beautiful . Thank you . I like your hairs . ( LAUGHS ) Thanks . I like your hairs too . Helena , this is your other sister Alison . Hello , Helena . Lovely to meet you . Pleased to meet you , too . ( CHUCKLES ) HELENA : You are married ? ALISON : Yes . Oh , yes , very much so , um , to Donnie . I will be married , too , one day . Well , it 's very rewarding if you can get through the rough patches . - KIRA : Auntie Helena . - ( RUNNING FOOTSTEPS ) ( GASPS ) We thought you ran away from us . I came back to see your little face . ( CHUCKLES ) ( SOFTLY ) I 'm so happy to see you , I 'm going to eat your finger . ( KIRA GIGGLES ) ( HELENA SNORTS ) She all right ? ( WHISPERS ) Yeah . ( UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ) Hmm . ( CHUCKLES ) - Yeah . - ( CHUCKLES ) Uh oh . - FELIX : Oh , yeah . - Oh , yeah . - FELIX : Come on . - ( COSIMA CHUCKLES ) Come on . ( GIGGLING ) ( ALL LAUGHING ) Whoa ! Whoo ! Whoo ! ( LAUGHING ) - ( ALL CHEERING ) - Whoo-hoo ! Go , Kira . Hey . What were you thinking about ? Oh , Buckmintser Fuller and sacred geometry . ( CHUCKLES ) Look . See this spiral ? This is the golden ratio and it 's a mathematical pattern that just repeats itself in nature in flower petals and honeybees and , you know , the stars in the galaxy and ... And in every molecule of our DNA . God , we 're so different , al * I of us . ( WHISPERS ) Yeah . I know . I don 't even know how to look at art . Don 't tell Fee . ( MUMBLES ) I won " t . You 're the wild type , Sarah . You propagate against all odds . You know , you 're ... restless . And you survive . ( WHISPERING ) I can 't do this without you , Cosima . ( SNIFFLING ) ( WHISPERING ) You 'll be fine . ( BREATHES DEEPLY ) Yeah . Just have to keep moving forward . Forward through the looking glass with Marian bloody Bowles . What could go wrong ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( INHALES DEEPLY ) ( HELENA GRUNTING ) ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) Thank you . ( CAR DOOR CLOSES ) Aunty Cosima ? Aunty Cosima . Aunty Cosima ! ( WHISPERING ) Don 't be afraid . I will never leave you . ( SIGHS ) Hello . Will you read me a story ? Mmm-hmm . Hello ? ( GIRL GIGGLING ) Hey . ( GIRL GIGGLES ) Are you hiding ? ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) Charlotte . It 's Sarah . Don 't be shy , love . Come on . Hello . ( WHISPERS ) You know her . You 're my big sister . - How old are you ? - Eight . I have a daughter your age . Her name is Kira . I 'm her cousin . Aunt , actually , but we 're gonna go with cousin for now . Come . ( MARIAN LAUGHING ) " That dog was the first dog to make the long journey west . " So the puppy followed the explorer that whole way ? Mmm-hmm . Coo * I , huh ? Can you read another ? Mmm-hmm . What you got ? ( CHUCKLES ) Whoa ! The Island of Dr Moreau . It 's about a man who makes monsters . I know . I love this book . ( WHISPERS ) It 's special . Where did you get this book ? Professor Duncan gave it to me for a present . Wow . So you 're her monitor . I 'm her mother . - You carried her ? - Adopted her . ( CHARLOTTE GIGGLING ) Like Siobhan . I 'm invested . I thought they couldn 't make any more of us . Oh , we tried . There were 400 attempts . Charlotte 's the only survivor . But you survived too , Sarah . Against all odds you found your sisters and you fought for your own . Now , I 'm counting on that fierce loyalty because what I 'm about to share could put me at grave personal risk . You won 't find Top Side in any company directory . We steer the Dyad group with many other multi-nationals . - You 're a cabal . - Yes . Securing monopolies on a future that embraces genetic engineering , synthetic biology ... A future I passionately believe is inevitable . And if you don 't profit , someone else will . Yes . But it 's not only about profit . There are other forces at work beyond Top Side . I had evidence of another agenda , but I couldn 't verify without your mother 's help . Please . ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) Sarah , the military never shut down Project LEDA . It was compartmentalised into two autonomous operations . While Dyad carried fema * le c * lones to term , a military faction carried the males . This is Project Castor . ( WHISPERS ) I know him . Sarah will never forgive me . You did what you had to . ( CHOIR SINGING ) And do you , Mark , promise to be faithful to Gracie ? - I do . - Mark , you may kiss the bride .

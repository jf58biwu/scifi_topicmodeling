 Dust of War For centuries humans looked at the stars ... viewed the heavens for signs of life ... and wondered if we were only . But one day the stars fell from the sky , fiery swords ... and aliens attacked the earth and brought humanity to its knees . Not conquered territories fell into the hands of tyrants . General Chizum , a ruthless warlord , seized power . When the rumor doing the rounds found that there was a child ... was a secret that even she was not supposed to know so powerful . The Free Legion vowed to protect her ... in the belief that it was a harbinger of peace . But the child , now a young woman ... fell into the hands of the evil General . To save ... the girl , and humanity get two bounty hunters commissioned to free her . And so begins my story . Soldier , get up . Bombs There was chaos in our midst . People killed each other . General Chizum want you to eat that there is the enemy . Not suitable . Next . Come on , open mouth . Open the door . You trying to eat my doctor ? The safety catch is off . You disappoint me . Put ? him in the cage . Easy , easy . We will keep you shortly . And how is my little harbinger ? I 'll find out your secret . The Legion will send someone , and then you will die . Welcome to the party . She is beautiful , but a bitch . - Fuck you . What took you so long ? - I chose the hard way . What is going on ? An inner voice , baby . - Do not call me .

I can crush your throat . I gotta look in my dictionary . Where are we going ? - You do not need to know , runaway . You 'll think of wimpy nicknames . A man are few . Bit over , huh ? He has his reasons . Just like you and me . He knows nothing about me . He knows you talk too much . Move . General ... I 'm disappointed . - We 'll get them back , sir . Call my boys . The men are ready . Can you shoot ? Can I have a gun ? Seriously ? I do not want to shoot . - . I did not want Sorry , matter of trust . Are you the Free Legion ? - Not exactly .

 Where we at ? He 's dropping in five . What 's up , little sister ? Where 's this moppet at ? - I hope he enjoys himself . - All right , here we go . Shit . Your middle name should have been " abortion . " He at the shoot house yet ? He 's pretty close . We made it impossible though . - Eight rounds , nine targets . - That 's not very nice , Henry . Yeah , yeah , he shot Michael . It 's way too soon . Way fucking too soon . All right , here we go , last room . - Why don 't you ever do that ? - Fuck you . Bring him in . " G " ! Enjoy your run back to base . Top man ! Oh , thank you . - Preston . - Jonathan ... Gates . Seriously , who throws a fucking pistol , mate ? Just seemed like the thing to do at the time . - Banger ? - Absolutely . Good , how you doing ? Good to see you , Gates . - You too , Henry . - We 've gotta get the rest of your paperwork ironed out . Locke 's inside . Roger that . - Hang tight on that . I 'll be back . - No worries . Oi ! Food 's ready . Well , this is home . - I like it . - This is " V. " Hi , how you doing ? - He 's shy . - Gates ! You , my friend , are a complete fucking psycho . He 's certainly got ... Don 't you have some goddamn paperwork to do ? - You got some child support to pay ? - Fuck you . - Welcome to the BlackJacks . - Thank you , sir . Follow me . I have thrown a pistol before , but never in a shoot house . Yeah , me neither . I almost didn 't do it . It held up pretty well . Springfield . - I 'm a Kimber man myself . - I like Kimber . Springfield just feels right . So , Gates , what was your monthly take-home in the army ? - 4170 with BAH . - Mmm . Our minimum contracts are six figures apiece . The thing is I 've seen a lot of guys lose their shit when they start making that kind of money . Trust me , you 're gonna need help figuring out what to do with it . I know a few bean counters . They 'll get you squared away and make sure you don 't blow it up your nose . Appreciate it . - You got some talent . - Thank you . Talent just tells me that you can . What concerns me is if you will . I got one rule , Gates . Never question me . Welcome aboard . Miss ! We already checked that whole south sector . Jesus ! Smith , over here ! Don 't worry , sir . We 'll get you out of here . Hi . You get any sleep last night ? - What 's wrong ? - Nothing . Alison . Don 't be afraid . I 'm not . It 's just that ... there has to be something else we can do . - Like what ? - We could do nothing . I did this . I cannot let anyone else be responsible for its outcome . It 's too valuable . Is it worth it ? - I miss your mom . - Me too , - and I want to go home . - We are going home . Hey . Of course I 'm a cutthroat . You don 't get to where I 'm at by being a pussy . I 'm unapologetically ruthless , or ruthlessly unapologetic , but there 's no mystery there . You don 't need that for the article . Why don 't you get to the point and ask me what you came here to ask me ? What did I come here to ask you ? You want to know where Dr. Whitmore is . Okay . One of the finest energy researchers in the country has been missing for ... nine months . Where is your former partner ? I don 't know . We think he was kidnapped . What I do know is we have a $ 3.5 million effort , and the finest people in the world are looking for him . Why don 't we take a few pictures ... in the bedroom ? Sir ? - There 's a situation . - Mm-hmm . Give me 19 minutes . We don 't have 19 minutes . Mmm , this interview ... is over . No . Tell me ... everything . We lost all communication with the facility approximately 26 minutes ago . We were alerted when the reactor started producing dangerous levels of energy . Just as we got online , the entire facility went dark . When can we be back online ? We can 't , not from here . Someone has to re-establish communication from the inside . Fuck ! Whitmore has something to do with this . We should terminate the project . - I can fix this . - Sir , if this gets out ... I 'm not gonna blow up a billion-dollar facility just because the phones are down . I want the best combat extraction team available to go in and get me Whitmore . I don 't care what it costs . - Hey . - Hey . Get to the airstrip . Now ? Yeah . - What 's taking so long ? - Just waiting for a signal . Should be about five minutes , sir . You guys got me ? We got you , Henry . We don 't have time for formalities . Apparently your team is the best , so I 've hired you . To the point : two days ago I lost contact with an off-the-books facility I have in Khazakstan . Now if you watch the news , you would know my partner Dr. Mark Whitmore has been missing for some time . He 's not . He 's here working for me at this very location . The following is the last footage we have of him before the drop in communication . There was seismic activity at the time of the recording . It might be the reason for the drop . I don 't care . I just need to know he 's alive . I 've lost contact with above-ground security that guards the entrance . Link up with them if they 're still onsite . I understand your team has worked with psychic operators before . Lisa Westbrook is the best in the business . If Whitmore is down there , she will find him . Don 't fuck this up . Please . All right , guys . I 'll be in your ears till you reach the base , then we 're going to be black until you fire up the link underground . Roger that , Henry . Miss Westbrook ? Lisa , please . It 's fairly straightforward . I just need to get close enough to get a lock on the doctor . And once I have positive ID , you will get him and get out . Exactly how are you going to " lock in " on their location ? So I round the corner , right ? And this fucking guy is shirtless and he 's holding back four of these huge Brazilian dudes , guns drawn , and he 's got a knife to the throat of the bouncer and I 'm like , " Jesus . What the fuck have I stumbled into ? " - They were Puerto Rican . - What ? Hey , I got this round . - Yeah ? - Yeah , it 's on me . - Thanks , Gatesy . - Fuckin-A , new guy . Right on . Make it a double ! - Can I get you something ? - No thanks . I got one . Can I ask you a question ? Sure . How long have you been psychic ? Or whatever the gift is that you have . Why ? Sorry . Didn 't mean to pry . No , no , it 's ... it 's fine . My mom has some sort of gift . She gets these feelings about things . - Empathic . - Yeah , maybe . But it was kinda rough growing up like that . I can 't even imagine what it was like for you . You know , you don 't strike me as the operator type . Yo , V , what is up ? Nice ! Where are we going , huh ? You want to get out of here ? Yeah , the Air Force is full of Alternative Units . - Do they recruit or what ? - Uh-huh . My first unit was a remote viewing squadron . And what was your job ? I worked with a lot of para-rescue guys . You know , finding downed pilots and such . - Oh . - And then the last few years I worked strictly with a snatch-and-grab team . Like kicking in doors ? Yeah . Well , I was there more to find the target , obviously . So why 'd you get out ? I , um ... I did some things that I wasn 't proud of . So tell me how it works . - What ? - Finding people . Okay , so your body gives off a vibration that I can feel . And everyone 's is slightly different . And you can feel this anywhere in the world ? Oh , no , no , no . I mean , I can only do it - within a mile or so . - Oh . Here , watch . Oh , shit ! I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to freak you out . No , that 's ... that 's incredible . Can you do that again ? Yeah . Yeah , I can 't do it for very long though . - Jesus . - Oh , God , I 'm so sorry . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . What was that ? That 's never happened before . Are you sure you 're okay ? Yeah , you know , I 'd better ... - go to bed . - Yeah . Sorry about your finger . There you go , swag monkey . Good boy . I can 't believe you 're actually jumping with us . I hope you don 't burn in . I only weigh 100 lbs . I 'd just bounce off the ground . All right , BlackJacks ! Don 't be pussies . That 's cute . Are you gonna walk 10 paces behind us ? Are you gonna button your fly ? Underwear , mate . Knock it off . Let 's go . It chafes too much . - " Men in Black . " - Will Smith . " Independence Day . " Brent Spiner . Who the fuck is Brent Spiner ? He was the scientist dude . Challenge . Brent Spiner was Data on " Star Trek : The Next Generation . " You are such a fucking nerd . So what do you do for fun ? - Just making small talk . - Shh shh shh . - What 's up ? - Hold on a second . - What 's up ? - I 'm picking up a group of people about a mile away . - Can you tell who they are ? - No . They 're all males . There 's about 15 of them . Henry , any chance we can get eyes on location ? Lisa 's picking up targets nearby . Negative , Locke . Your sat 's still down . You know what ? Let me see what I can piggyback on . Locke , wait one ... there 's a Russian satellite . I 'll give it a shot . Locke , I got eyes on , but the image is completely scrambled . Roger . - What does that mean ? - I don 't know . Hey , V. I need you right there . Ed , Preston . You guys post up right here . - Lisa ? - Yeah ? You 're with V. She can tell us where everybody is . Stay at least 40 meters behind me . And don 't give away my position . Okay . Gates . You 're with me . What do you think , V ? - Looks like a merc group . - They 're Chechen . I 've seen their kind before . Yusufiyah ' 05 . They 're nasty . I 've had some experience with these clowns as well . Hey , they have an American down there . - Henry . - Go ahead . We have eyes on location . There 's a group of hostiles on the ground . Hey , I 've got casualties in the west corner . Looks like they 've killed the security detail . There 's one left alive . Locke . I 'm gonna drop this motherfucker . He 's about to take this guy down . Hold your fire , V. I say again , I have the shot . Negative . Don 't compromise your position . We can 't maneuver from here . Locke , they 're gonna kill this guy . - We 're running out of time . - Stand down . You take that shot , we 'll have 20 Aks lighting this hill up . Henry , you tell Cromwell we 're taking these fuckers out . That 's a go , Locke . - All right . - Fuck ! God damn it , God damn it . God damn it . Fuck ! All right , we 're gonna secure this compound . V , you wait for us to get into position , then on my signal start putting fuckers to sleep . About fucking time . Gates and I will lead . Ed , Preston , you two follow and flank . Let 's get as close as we can before we go loud . Lisa , tell me how many targets are down there . 16 total targets . Most are in the main building . All right , gentlemen , nothing fancy . Straightforward violence of action . Let 's go . Go hot in three ... two ... One . Motherfucker ! Fuck , Ed . V , a little help ! I don 't got a shot on the guys inside . V , there 's three coming around the back of the building . - There 's nothing there . - Just wait , they 're coming around . Lisa , don 't let that fucker flank us ! - Gates ? - Clear ! All clear , Eddie . V , we 're coming out . Get away from me . BlackJack ! Don 't say a fucking word . Never shoot through a fucking door , fuck ! - All right , all right . - Motherfucker ! Getting a bit old for this , Locke , eh ? - Fuck you ! - He 's hit . Just cover it . Lisa , are we clear down here ? No one around but you guys . All right , V , bring it in . These assholes stink . Look what I found . Oh , shit . - Henry . - Go ahead . The Chechens were here for Whitmore . We found his pictures on one of them . - What ? Did they find the entrance ? - No . It was covered when we got here . Fuck ! Okay , tell me when you have him . Yeah . Let 's go . Get it off . Shit . On me . Hey , hold up . Can I take a look at that map for a second ? Gates , map . All right , so I 'm picking up what looks like the reactor right there . It 's giving off a lot of interference . And I 'm picking up what I think is Dr. Whitmore right here . He 's in the lab area . Good . I 'm not picking up anyone else down here . It doesn 't matter . Our mission 's the doctor . - We get him , we get out . - Roger that . On me . It 's blood . Somebody was pissed off . You don 't have to worry about it . There 's no one else down here . I think we 've got it , Westbrook . Clear left ! Clear right ! - Center clear . - Room clear . What the fuck ? Are you sure you 're not picking up anybody ? No one . Tell me when he gets close . 100 meters . On Eddie , let 's go ! Move out . Which way , Gates ? Okay , left takes us to the comm room . And if we head right that should take us down to the lower research lab . Eddie . Take Preston , go left , set up comms . We 'll grab the target and meet you there . Be fast . I don 't want to be here all day . Are you sure you want to separate ? Yeah , I 'm sure . - Westbrook ! - Yeah ? You 're positive he 's down this way ? Gates . V. - Clear . - Fuck off . Is it gonna work ? I sure as shit hope so . Bingo . - Clear left . - Clear right . Room clear on me . - He should be right about here . - Go , go . Whitmore ! Dr. Whitmore . Open the door ! - No . - Open the door . Cromwell sent us . Open the door . Open the fucking door . No . I got you , Ed . You got picture ? Ed , do you have video ? Do you have audio ? - Ed ! - I heard you the first time , fuckstick . Hey , I 'm not paying you to fuck around ! Show some respect . Where 's Whitmore ? The rest of our team are acquiring him . They 'll be here shortly . All right , what 's the status of my facility ? Unknown . From what the psychic tells us there 's no one here except the doctor . - There 's nobody down there ? ! - No . Son of a bitch . The doctor should be here shortly , sir . Find him . Find him ! Hey , Whitmore , open the door ! Dr. Whitmore ? Dr. Whitmore , look at me . Look at me . I need you to open the door for us . Can you do that for me ? We 're here to protect you . Can you open the door ? Open the fucking door . You gotta ... you gotta close the door . You gotta ... I 'm sorry ... ow ! Ow ! Close the door ! Close the door ! Close the door ! You have to lock that door ! You have to lock the door ! Close the door ! - Close it , please please please . - Do it . You comfy ? I 'll get it , I 'll get it . What happened down here , doc ? Where 's your staff ? Hey ! You wouldn 't believe me if I told you . What are they doing ? Preston , can I get an ETA on the doctor ? Yeah , hold on a sec . Ed , what the fuck ? ! Contact , contact ! Lisa , help Whitmore . Preston , we 're on our way ! - No , I 'm not going out there ! - Let 's move , move move move ! I 'm not going out back there . Ed ! Preston ! Motherfucker ! Preston , Preston , wake up . Preston , hey ! Come on , Preston ! Fuck ! Come on , man , come ... Move move move move ! - Breathe breathe . - Ed , Ed , Ed ! - Oh , shit . - Gotta breathe , gotta breathe , come on . Breathe breathe breathe . Come on , let 's get up . You can stand . Ready ? Let 's go . Get him the fuck in there ! Ed ? Fuck ! Locke , they got Ed ! Who got Ed ? What the fuck happened , Whitmore ? Ed , Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! Ed ! Fuck . Come on , Gates . Fuck . Come on . Whitmore . - Whitmore ! - Talk , fucker . There was an accident . Locke , where 's Ed ? - Shut the fuck up . - You shut the fuck up ! Henry , calm down . I need you to get us out of here . Don 't lose your head . - Whitmore ! - There 's some kind of creature running loose down here . It killed everybody . What the fuck are you talking about ? - Henry . - What , the entire staff is dead ? Everybody . Cromwell you get that door open ! Cromwell , open that fucking door ! All right . V ? V. Henry ! You motherfucker ! Fucker ! ... fucking kill you . Goddamn motherfucker ! I 'm gonna fucking kill you ! Motherfucker ! Goddamn motherfucker ! Fucker ! V. We 'll fix it . Let 's finish this mission . Gear up . We need an exit . Ideas ? - Blow the door ? - We don 't have enough C4 . Plus it 's a fucking shaft . Tell us how to get out of here . - Take me with you . - He 'll slow us down . - You want to go or not ? - Hey ! Fucking cooperate with us , all right ? Just cooperate with us and we will get you out of here , you understand that ? There 's a tunnel at the far side of the complex leading into the valley . Show me . - That 's a tunnel ? - Yeah . All right , I can get us there . - Alive , I hope . - That depends on you . What are we up against out there ? It came through the reactor . I developed a machine that could capture ribbons of energy in a parallel dimension . Cromwell was funding it . But three months ago he started to threaten me and my daughter , and I knew that if I delivered him the complete works , I would be dead . So I overcharged the reactor causing a distraction , during which I was supposed to meet a rescue team that would take me over the Russian border . Your rescue party was a group of Chechen terrorists . No ! No , no , they were just supposed to escort me . I had to get somewhere where Cromwell couldn 't get to me . Focus . Describe it . Is it biological ? Is it mechanical ? What is it ? I only saw it for a moment . To come through the portal , I think it has to be biological . - Why didn 't you pick that up , huh ? - I don 't know . - That 's your job ! That is your job ! - I don 't know , okay ? It 's not giving off anything I can pick up ! I 'm sorry . Whatever that thing is , let 's headed for the tunnel . Staggered formation , keep your heads on a swivel , 360 at all times , watch your overheads and put rounds in anything that moves . Let 's go , come on . - Preston ! - I 'm all right . Let 's move ! Move move move ! Come on ! Go , go , go ! - Gates ! - Clear ! - Gates ? - Clear . Clear right . - Preston ? - Clear ! All clear . Watch up top ! What the fuck was that thing ? Are you okay ? Aw , no . No , no , no , no , no . - What 's going on , doc ? - He 's overloading the reactor . It 's ... it 's gonna fracture . This whole place is gonna implode . - Shut it down . - I can 't shut it down ! All right , how much time do we have ? Nights on ! There 's no point . He cut the power . - So what ? - So ... you don 't understand . We cannot open the door - without power . - There 's always a backup generator . You just gotta find it . Yes yes yes , right there , right there . - That is a generator , I know it . - It 's far . - No , we can make it . - We gotta move . No , listen listen . I 'll get the power on . - I 'll meet you at this door right here . - No , no , no . - We stay together . - Do it . You got a problem ? Are you sure you want to split us up again ? 'Cause we 're a lot more effective together . We lost Ed , you saw what happened to Preston ... What the fuck is wrong with you ? Fuck , think outside of the fucking box ! God damn it ! Listen to me very carefully . Right or wrong , I make the decisions for this team . You follow orders or you 're free to go on your way . Is that clear ? Yeah . Okay . Do it . Let 's go . I 'm picking up something coming in fast . - Where ? - It 's right in front of us . It 's closing . Put rounds on this thing till it 's down ! It 's closing . It 's closing ! Wait wait , it 's a female ! Hold your fire ! Cover . Covering . Stay down ! Who are you ? Alison ? Alison ! - Who is she , Whitmore ? - It 's okay . - She 's my daughter . - It 's all our fault . No , we did what we had to do . Check her out , Preston . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . 10 seconds , Preston . Stick with me , yeah ? Let 's move . Move move ! Watch your overhead ! Shh , shh , shh , shh . We 'll get out of this , okay ? Holding ! Holding ! - My dad is out there ! - Clear left ! - Clear right . - Cover ! - Covering . - Put your head down , put your head down . Okay , get me some light over here . - Yeah , yeah . - Some light . Okay , baby , okay okay okay . I ... I can 't pick up V anymore . What ? V ? V ? V ! V ! V ! V ! - V ! - Is he alive ? I ... I don 't know . You don 't fucking know ? I don 't know ! I can barely pick up you guys . This is fucking bullshit . Get your shit together , Preston . What the fuck am I supposed to do ? - You do your job ! - No , no , no , hold it . I dumped a whole magazine into that fucker ! So did I. I 'm gonna keep on doing that ! - There 's no rolling fucking dice ! - What options do we have ? Hey hey , shut the fuck up ! Listen to me ! We can 't beat it . We can avoid it though . Now get the fuck down here and hold this and I 'll show you how . - You got it ? - Yeah , I think . This tunnel , right here , that can 't be more than a few feet wide . I don 't think that thing can fit through it . But if he does , we can focus all firepower into one direction . All right ? Now it 's gonna drop us just shy of the door . - You see that ? - Good idea . Preston , can she move ? She has to . Yeah . - All right . - Gatesy , help me out with her . Three , two , one . Come on , come on , come on . - All right , clear . - Clear ! Go , go , go , go ! Lead on . Stay with me . Okay . Hey ! - I can 't . - Come on , stay with me . I can 't . Sweetie , are you all right ? - Preston ? - Just wait ! I wanna see my dad . Where is my dad ? It 's all right . You 're gonna see him soon . Hey , I 'm here . - Good boy . - V , you 're a beauty . Good to hear your voice , V. What 's your status ? I 'm good . Found a way around . I 'll be there soon . Hustle . We 're close . Fuck , the reactor ! Get the fuck out of here ! Come on , move ! Watch your top . Watch it . - Preston , with me . - Open left , over left . On me , watch out . Come on , come on ! - Clear left ! - It 's not working ! - It 's not working ! - Check for a manual override . Here we go , here we go . I think I 've got it . This is it . Yes ! Yeah , that 's it ! That 's it ! Heep going , Preston . Move ! Get this fucking thing open . I got you . V ! Nice fucking shot . Oh , fuck . Come on , we gotta get the fuck out of here , come on . How many rounds you got ? Gates , how many rounds ? ! Nothing , I 'm out . I only got one clip of .45s. Shit . Preston , let 's go . Preston ! Preston 's dead . We 've gotta go . Preston ! He 's gone ! Preston , Preston ! Go , go ! Go , go , go , go ! You go first . Go , go , go ! Hurry , get the fuck out of here . Fuck ! Come on , Locke . Come on . Locke ! Gates , get some slugs over here . What the fuck ? Shoot , man , shoot . Fuck . What the fuck ? Come on ! I 'm out . Shit ! Get the fuck out of here . Get the fuck out of here ! What the fuck are you doing ? - No , no . - Get the fuck outta here . - Gates , fucking go . - No , no , no . Fucking go , fucking go ! - Get the fuck ... - Fuck ! This changes nothing , you know . And that wasn 't my only base of operations . Talent just tells me that you can . What concerns me is if you will .

 PROTECTED BY THE BOUNDARY . ALL MEMORIES OF THE PAST WERE ERASED . After The Ruin , we started over . Creating a new society . One of true equality . Rules were the building blocks of that qualities . We learned them as a new children . Rules like : " Use precise language " , " Wear your assigned clothing " , - " Take your morning medication . " - Injected . " Obey the curfew . " " Never lie . " THE GIVER My name is Jonas . I don 't have a last name , none of us did . That day , the day before graduation , I admitted , I was scared . Tomorrow we 'd be assigned our jobs . Our purpose . Seemed everyone knew their already . Not me . I was lost . I always felt that I saw things ... Differently . I saw things other people didn 't . I never said anything . I didn 't wanna be different . Who would ? Jonas ! I apologize , we 're late , I got Asher to come say goodbye the teacher . I accept your apology . Asher and Fiona , we 've been friends our whole lives . Asher was the boy who made everyone laugh . Fiona ... well . She was the girl who made everybody smile . Whoever is listening : please , please ! Do not make me vise chief of voice management ( ? ) . Please . We lived in a world where differences weren 't allowed . There was no " Popular " , no " Fame " , no " Losers " and no " Winners " . Our elders had eliminated all of that , so there be no conflict between us . Fear , pain , envy , hate ... There weren 't words , so much as sounds . Their echoes were gone to the other side of history . I wonder if I should apologize for what I did . I 'll let you decide . I 'm going to miss volunteering here . Oh No ! If ever there is a person boring to work in the Nurturing Center . I could be surprise , right ? Jonas , if you had to guess , of all positions the Elders picked for me ... Nurturing Center . Welcome to the Nurturing Center . - I got this . I got this . Think Heaven . - Come on . Come on . - Think Heaven . We win ! Or you might be the champion ! - Which one is the heavier ? - Mine . Asher ! - Father , I think Fiona put her finger on the scale ! - I did not ! Oh , this little guy didn 't qualify for tomorrow 's ceremony . He 's just not strong enough to be assigned to a family yet . He looks so unhappy ... It 's okay , Jonas , you can open it . Oh . Hey ! It 's Jonas . Here let me . There you go , there you go ... It 's okay - Some people have it . - That is just not fair ! Be strong , Gabriel ! You looked at his name ? Is it not against the rules ? Yeah , i-it is ... I just thought having a name would help him grow . I whispered to him so no one can hear . Sometimes I call him " Gabe " . It 's usually anxious , I thought that if I hear ... - Are you okay ? - Huh ? Yeah , I 'm fine . So the old man turns to Elder and says , " Do you know who I am ? " And the Elder says , " Sir , I know you 're old , but that is not the excuse for being prideful . " Then the old man says , " No , really , I am asking : who am I " ? I don 't get it ... " Who am I " . Like he forgot who he was . Okay , but wouldn 't the joke be better if the old man says ... So : one ... one ... two ... Three ! - Aren 't we graduates now ? - You do this every time , come on ! One , two , three ... ! There you go ... So ... I guess this is it . Last night of our childhood . I guess everything is gonna be different . No , tomorrow , the only thing that changes is what we do . It doesn 't change who we are . - Good question . Who are we ? - Friends . - Friends forever . - Yes . Even when you 're both designed be birth mothers . Well , I guess , we 'll find out tomorrow , huh ? Citizens are reminded that the evening recreation will ending in 13 minutes . Thank you . Well he did need to be rehabilitated . I know he was Lily 's teacher , but what was I supposed to do ? I feel ... disappointment . - What was elder 's decision ? - Released to elsewhere . Can I released elsewhere , Mother ? Even just for one day ... ? No you are to young , Lily-billy . Jonas ... your turn for feelings . Well , I guess some sort of ... Terrified . Precision of language . I mean anxious . When you are about to graduate you , did you ever feel ... that there was no position meant for you ? They 've been watching since you were a new child . The Elders are never wrong . You will find your place . Welcome , citizens , to the annual ceremony of advancement . Please , standby for a transmission . - Good morning , Community . - Good morning , Chief Elder ... I apologize for my remote attendance . We accept your apology . I can 't be at every ceremony - in person . But here 's the secret : you are my favorite community . However , because we do not lie , I readly admit I said that to every community . Beginnings ... From disorder and chaos , from great suffering , great pain ... from confusion , and envy and hatred ... came a solution : communities . Beautiful places , where disorder became harmony . Thank you . Let me get through it . Oh , fine ... It begins The Ceremony . Ceremony of the release to Elsewhere . Honoring elderly citizens who have devoted their work to the beauty and harmony of our beloved community . And now ready for a joys retirement to elsewhere . Celebrating the new Children .

Jonas has not been assigned a position , Jonas has been selected . We are not hasty this time , and we could not afford another failure . Jonas posses all four attributes . Intelligence , integrity , courage and one I can name , but ... I can not describe : the capacity to see beyond . But I must warn you : your training involves pain . Pain far beyond anything we known . Are you strong enough ? Do we think Jonas is brave enough ? Jonas , you have been selected as our next Receiver of memories . Thank you for your childhood . Jonas ... Jonas , Jonas ... - Help me up , please . - Okay . This leg , yup . That one . You got it . - Sit back , Sit back ... - Is Jonas now more powerful than you ? What is the Chief Elder mean , when she said : " We can not afford another failure " ? - Well , ten years ago , the receiver ... - We can not speak of it . You 've been greatly honored . - You got it . Go , go ! - I can do it . We should probably catch Lily . - Good ! Good , Lily ! - I can ride ! Receiver of memory . Five rules . One : Report directly to the receiver of memory for your training . After training , return immediately to your dwelling . Two , From this moment , you are exempt from all rules governing rudeness . You may ask any questions . Three , beside from your daily injection , you may not receive other medicines . Especially those for pain . Injected . S752 . Four , you may not discuss your training with anyone . Ever . - Your look so important ... - I don 't know ... ? - Stick out ? - Oh , yeah , there is only one receiver of memory . Two . What have they say again ? " You have the capacity to see beyond " ? Yeah ... Can 't wait to hear every single detail ! Five : you may lie . Asher and I , we used to dare each other to get closed to his place . It was built right on the edge . We all heard of people getting lost to the edge . Never to be seen again . And yet ... here I was . Being told that I have to get close to it every day . For the rest of my life . Welcome . Uhm , Hi . I 'm Jonas ... Please gaze at the sensor . Welcome , Receiver of Memories . They 're called Books . Your Books . - My name is ... - I know who you are . Of course , I apologize . " I apologize " ... ? Don 't say that . " I apologize " ... don 't apologize to me . Never again , not here . We haven 't time to " apologize " . That 's an automatic pleasantry . It does not mean anything . I apologise ... I 'm sorry . I mean ... We are here for only one purpose . Simply stated ... Although it isn 't really simple at all I 'll transmit you all the memories that I hold within me . Memories of the past . I 'd be very interested to learn about your life . No , no . Not .. Not my life . You 'll learn the secret history of the world ! Before me , before you , generations back and back and back . When things were different : when there was more . " More " ... ? Get ... Chair . You see , no one in our community has any memory of the past . Only me . When the elders need guidance that is beyond their experience , I provide wisdom , that is now your role . To provide guidance in the present , using the memories of the past . Move closer . Where to begin ... ? Move closer . Closer . There is no way for me to prepare you , for what I 'm going to do now . It 's gonna take comfort in knowing ... You 're completely helpless . If any of this proof is too much for you , tell me immediately . I just have ... Silent Night ... Holy Night ... All ... That was ... It was ... - How that happened ? - What do you mean ' how ' ? It happened . - But it 's impossible ! - And yet , it happened . But ... why ? Why don 't we have ... That ... Thing ... Come on ... the memories they give you the word , it 's not a " thing " ... - " Sledge " ! - Sledge . And the ... - Snow . - Snow ... - Did my parents have them ... Did you ... ? - No ... no ... It 's a very distant memory . Simply stated ... There is no snow because of climate control . But why don 't people know about them ? What 's so dangerous in the memory of a sledge ? What 's so dangerous ... ? For sledge you need snow , Snow is cold , cold destroys crops ... which meant farmers couldn 't farm . Unpredictable weather , hills , mountains ... made it difficult to transport of food . And we had hunger , starvation , famine ... Everything is connected , everything is in balance . Where there is good , there is always bad . - The two ... - Show me more ! Let 's go for a walk . A real one , with your legs . At the bottom of the hill ... I saw something . Like a place . - " Home " . - Home . Yes . " Home " ? Like a dwelling ? - Mr. Receiver ... - Good morning ! No ... It is different . A dwelling is not a " home " . A " Home " means more . Your instructions said I can lie , do you lie ? Ah , all the time ! Mostly for personal amusement . But I won 't lie to you . How do I know that 's not a lie ? There was someone else before me . What happened to them ? One more question ! If I 'm now the receiver , what does that make you ? Well . Then that must make me ... The Giver . So how was it ? - It was good . - What did you do ? - We just talked . - What else ? That 's it . - You seem different . - How do you mean ? - I 'll see him tomorrow . - He cancel them , no matter what I do . - And you said you 'll look after it . - I know , I said . - I apologize . - I accept your apology . - Thank you , Dinah . - Thank you . - Gabriel ! - How does Jonas know the child 's name ? - Jonas met Gabriel the other day . - He 's so cute ! Would you like to issue me a warning , director of Justice ? Just for a while , Mother , till little guy catch up us . I think we all agree that you will sleep in my room . - Only if the Elders says it 's okay . - They will . Yeah ... Lily , give me a comfort object . Come on , Lily , it 's time for bed . - Look at this ... - Bye , baby ! This is a mythical creature called " hippo . " And it 's incredibly fast , because it has two , three , four , five legs ! We had the same mark . And it 's very strong ... They almost did not have to see his to know . I felt it . Felt that one day Gabriel would be chosen too . ... hippo ! Yeah ... ! - That 's the pain they all talk about . - No ... Not even close . - Did you ... - It had a face ! - Wait ... Was that thing alive ... ? - Don 't skip ahead . - Did you notice anything about them ? - Yes : It hurt . No , any quality ? . Well maybe ... I think I saw it in friend Fiona 's hair . My twist is yellow . If you thought the slid was special ... It 's ... " Red " ! - Just like her hair ... - Yes . There are red , green , blue ... Many different colours . You 'll see them all in time . With our people ... They chose to ... do away with all of them ... Color , race , religion ... They created sameness . If we were different , we could be envious ... angry , resentful ... consumed by hatred . We need sameness . - Don 't you think ? - Oh , I completely agree ! And still it 's also beautiful . They always said the Elsewhere is so far away . But it wasn 't . It was right there . Close enough to touch . Jonas , have you fallen ... ? - Do you need immediate help ? - No , I .. I was just ... What 's going on with you ? Nothing 's going on with me . No you 're right , it 's totally normal to lie in the grass and stare at the sky . No , I was just ... You are seeing something , aren 't you ? Can 't you tell me ? Give me your hands . What do you see ? - Oh my goodness ... - You see it ? Yes . It 's water . Come on , concentrate . Uhm ... Hi ! Jonas was just teaching me about his training . As you can see , it 's " incredibly interesting " . Can 't be as great as mine . Can 't have your minds blown ... ? - Whoa ! Do you know how to fly those ? - Absolutely ! Sort off ... I 'm learning . When I 'm flying , looking down at everything ... - It 's like I 'm seeing things for the first time . - You get to fly into elsewhere ? Oh , yeah ! Once , when I was looking at that mist ... Even though they tell us there is nothing close to the edge , I thought I saw a tree out there somewhere . Don 't get too excited , I 've actually seen elsewhere . It 's just mostly weird rocks that kind of stuff . What 's weird about them ? There is these two huge rocks leaning against each other making a kind of ... triangle . Hey , it 's kind like our triangle ! - What 's past their ? - Don 't know . We are not allowed to fly past that . So many secrets ... So what are your secrets ? Uhh ... nothing . What do you mean , " Uhh , nothing " ? You are receiver of memory . Maybe I can show you . - Okay . Grab a tray . - What ... ? Bring it over to the solar plate , come on ! Now , this might seem a little funny , but you got to trust me . Okay . Sit down on the tray . Careful ... - Whoa ... whoa ! You 're not gonna ... - What ? Are you scared ? I 'm scared of nothing . I was just ... - It 's against the rules , Jonas . - Since when do you care about the rules ? Actually I have auxiliary training . I 'll see you guys . Look who grew up ... Lucky for you , I haven 't . Okay ... Now go ! Put your heels down to slow it ! I think your training may be more funnier than mine . Please , standby for a Community announcement . Citizens are reminded that it is impolite to touch community members outside your family unit . Thank you . He is punctual . He is inquisitive . - How inquisitive ? - He 's interested in his position . Then why is he breaking the rules ? He has been observed trying to share his training with his former classmate . That always happens . But it 's an impossible experiment . Even I tried to share the memories back when I was in training . If you remember ... So ... forget about it . I don 't tell you what to do in your position , so don 't tell me . I apologise , but ... - Isn 't that what 's happening now ? - Your apology is accepted , but ... You 're being careless . You are moving too fast , we both know what happened ten years ago with the girl . The girl had a name . You think I don 't remember her name ? I know you feel the loss . The boy must hold in the pain . Don 't fail us again . Want me to read all these ? Uh , What 's this ... ? " One day you should meet a boy who answers to the name of Jonas . " " He should be the most powerful of all the receivers " . - Wait : that says ... ? - Don 't be gullible . " Plan for sameness . " - Another trick ? - Actually , no . It 's some kind of ... map . Triangle of Rocks ! Hey ... ! That 's real , my friend Asher actually saw it ! Look at all this towers ... What are they for ? How could your friend see the Triangle of Rocks ? He 's a pilot , he told me , he saw it . What 's past that ? Past the " outer edge , boundary of Memories " ? A mystery . " Boundary of Memories " , is that what they 've built so the memories will only stay within you and me ? - Let 's move on . - Wait ! That boundary is meant to keep the memories in . So , if a receiver crosses it , does that means the memories get set free ? Perhaps ... perhaps if you and I crossed it , everyone could feel those memories again . So what am I seeing today ? Nothing . You are seeing nothing today . We already covered " seeing beyond " . There is also such a thing as " hearing beyond " . A table ... ? All of the food would slide to the floor . Now don 't judge me ... I 'm not very good . Even though I had a very good teacher . Music ... Well ... music when I hit the right keys . Just like music , there 's something else you can 't see with your eyes . Something that lives deep inside you . Something ... This morning injections take away . I thought the injections are for our health . No ... they remove something . What ? Emotions ! You like feelings ... ? Feelings are just fleeded on the surface . But emotions ... they are very deep ... Primal ... they linger and Jonas ... You might not understand where you are or what 's happening . But don 't think about what you are seeing . Listen ! Listen to what 's calling from inside . Antonio ! What beautiful wedding ! Why would anyone want to get rid of this ? Good question ... - What are you doing ... ? - Take my hands ! Ready ? Are you ready for the fast part ? And turn ! - Spin ! - What are you doing with her ? Jonas says it 's called dancing . Please , Standby for a transmission . - I apologize for my intrusion . - We accept your apology . - I just wanted to say " Hello " . - Hello . - I am Lily . - Yes , I know . You are nine now , isn 't that right ? Lily , I think it 's ... time for school . Now we get going . Hello , Jonas . - Hello . - How 's your training ? Injected . - Fine . - I 'm concerned about the receiver . - Many years ago there was an incident . - What kind of incident ? Living alone in a building on the edge can ... isolate a person . I am concerned that the receiver ... is becoming reckless . Are you being properly prepared ? - I think so . - You are focused ? Perhaps you are spending too much time with friends from your childhood ? - I 'm focused . - Jonas ! What do you and the receiver , actually do ? - My rules say not allow to share . - She is the Elder-chief . FROM THE ASHES OF THE RUIN , THE COMMUNITIES WERE BUILT . - My rules say not allow to share . - She is the Elder-chief . - My rules say not allow to share . - She is the Elder-chief . Jonas she only wants to help . You are right . But you can 't tell the receiver I told you . You have my word . We sit on chairs and don 't talk all day long . And when the time is up , I came back here and in the morning I do all it again . I apologize , but I 'm late . Your apology is accepted . Goodbye Mother . Injected . He is not usually like this . I 'm surprised you 're not more worried about him . If he were my responsibility ... I would be . We 've been told that Elder-chief knew everything . Things nobody else did . But I had learned that knowing of what something is ... It 's not the same as knowing how something feels . You could be the very best , the last one at top of the mountain ... Gasping for air , having survived ... and be alone . Be curious . I got lost ... the good kind of lost ! I saw sites and sounds , I had no words to describe . Faces with flesh of all different colors . I feel so alive ... This was forbidden ? I didn 't know what to think , what to believe . " Have faith " , The Giver told me . He said : " Faith , that was seeing beyond . " He compared it to the wind : something felt but not seen . Don 't accept . What is the truth just because it 's coming from someone you respect . I feel completely stupid , a weird feeling . Tingles in your hands . Memories are not just about the past , they determine our future . You can change things , you can make things better . It was life .. It just seemed more complete . The more I experienced , the more I wanted . Once there were other living things . But unlike us they knew who their mothers and fathers were . They had joy ... And they had pain . I can 't prepare you for what 's going ... No need to warn me every single time ... No , Jonas . You don 't understand : there was tremendous cruelty ... Giver ! I 'm not a kid anymore . Show me . That 's $ 250,000 of ivory . Come on . Come on ! - Put in ! - Again , again . No , stop ! Stop ! Stop ... Hey ! Hey , Gabe ? Okay , Gabe ... If I tell you a secret , you promise not to tell anyone ? I 'll take that as a " yes . " This comfort object ... is not hippo . It 's an elephant , and once it was real . And it was beautiful ... Citizens are reminded that sleep period commences in 15 minutes . Thank you . It was like a memory , but Fiona was there . You had a dream . - A what ? - A " Dream " . A combination of reality , fantasy , emotions and what you had for dinner . You 've stopped taking your injections , haven 't you ? The emotion was so strong ... And at the wedding ! Everyone all together laughing and dancing ... The old with the young , the bride with the groom , there was something there . But different from what we have . Yes ... We don 't have that anymore . What do you mean by that ? I 'm talking about what you feel for someone else . And mind can not explain it and you can 't make it go away . - What is it ? - Love . It 's called " Love " . Love ... Oh Hi ! Hi ! So what 's new ? - What 's new with you ? - What 's ever new ? - Why are you being weird ? - I 'm not . I 'm just ... Just ... Long the hippo game ! Hold On ! Father , Do you love me ? Jonas . Precision of language . Please ! What does " love " mean ? I got him , Lily . Jonas used the word so antiquated that it no longer has any application . If you ask , " Do you enjoy me ? " ... The answer is certainly " Yes " . Or do Mother and I take pride in your accomplishment ... Of course we do . Do you understand ? Yes . I think I finally do . Hey ! Hey ... Gabe ... ! I love you , Gabriel ... Giver ! You were right , I asked my family about love and ... get down ... get down ! Giver ! They are in the trees ! There are in the trees , Robbie ! Get down ! Robbie , get down ! Robbie , get down ! Robbie , get down ! Stay down ! I can 't see you , man ! They are in the trees ! Stay down ! May Day ! Taking heavy fire ! Send help ! Robbie ... Robbie ! No ... Jonas ... What ... ? - I 'm sorry Jonas ... - How do people do that ? I didn 't mean for you to receive that . Not for years . Don 't .. Don 't let this turn you away way . - I 'm not strong enough . - Of course , not yet . But Jonas ... This what we need to know , so we can advise ! I can 't ... I 'm sorry , I can 't ... - I just can 't . - Jonas ! Jonas ! Jonas , Come back ! Please ! Come back inside , Let me explain it ! When you see something like that ... there is no explanation . Rosemary ... Promise me you come back tomorrow ! Rosemary ! Hey , Jonas ! Come on . You are ... Just in time . I did never wanna go back ... I didn 't want the wisdom . I didn 't want the pain . I wanted my childhood again . Scraped knees and ball games ... Back then we had played " war " . But the war was real . The Elders understood that . They erased it from our world . Maybe they were right . - Could you watch over Harry for me ? - Of course . Hey , what 's wrong ? - Nothing . - I know you . - You do , do you ? - Yes ... What do you think would happen if you skipped the morning injection ? If you skipped it ? Then the sensors would blink and remind me that I forgot it . No I don 't mean if you forgot , I mean ... What do you think would happen if you chose not to be injected ? Jonas , I thought something is wrong . There is something wrong . Everything is wrong . I quit . Fiona , I 'm done being the receiver . - This morning , I skip the injection . - Wait : " You quit " ... ? Cut your finger and put a little blood on this apple . No , you can 't quit , if you quit your position , you get sent to elsewhere . Leave in the morning , put the apple over the sensor , - it will find your blood and think it 's your hand . - Stop , you 're scaring me . Fiona , I need you to do this , I need you to feel what I know . Jonas . An apple wouldn 't even work . I 've been doing it for months , since worked every single time . Don 't quit , you can 't leave . I don 't think I can go back to that place . - You will , if you want me to do this . - Okay , fine . But tomorrow , after work , meet me in the Triangle . I wanted to share with her . Not all of it , but good things . Was I wrong to want that ? I thought about her now . All the time . Hello ... ? I have something to show you . Come here ! Who are you ? Come over here and try this . - Me ... ? - Me ? Yeah , I want to teach you . You 've come back . - Where did you learn that ? - From the memories you gave me . And you can do it quiet ? It 's beautiful . Who 's that ? This ... is Rosemary . The previous Receiver . She 's the one they all talk about . It no longer exists ... Except here . And in my memories . She was in training only two short months . Watch how the fingers move ... Unlike you . She wanted to experience ... Well , everything ! I 've only give her pleasant beautiful memories . She fought me ... - Don 't protect me ! - No ! Don 't show me a map and then not give me all the memories . - I thought we 're gonna help . - We will . - But we must move slow . - Show it to me ! You gave her war ? I gave her the memory of the child . A child taken from her mother . I gave her loss ... Too soon ! You 're going to get a hang on this . The light went from her eyes ... The next morning , without telling me ... She went to the Elder-chief and asked to be released . So she was released . And now lives in Elsewhere . Yes , Receiver . I 'd like to see this morning 's release . Thank you for your instructions . Okay ... That 's my father ! This one is heavier . - More twins ! Great ! - Watch ! Oh , good ... For a moment I thought they will be exactly the same . - Here we go ... - Then we would have a problem ! - Okay ... - Thank you , Dinah . - Hey new ... Only one unit less . Oh , I know it hurts , I know ... But I had to put it in your vein , and the your arms are too tiny . Almost there ... Done ! It wasn 't so bad , was it ? That 's death . - He doesn 't know what he 's doing . - " Doesn 't know what he 's doing " ... ? - He killed him ! - But he doesn 't know what it means . Just like you did , neither did Rosemary . How can he not see the baby isn 't moving ? Doesn 't that tell him something is wrong ? The young and the old killed . Your friend , Fiona , she will soon be trained to release as well . That 's a lie . She would never do that . - If Fiona understood ... - We are the only one who understand it . Then it 's our fault . You and me and all the receivers back and back and back and back . There has to be a way to show them . To give them the memories so they can understand ! - Yes ... - Because if you can 't feel ... - What 's the point ? - But ... what can you do ? Citizens are reminded that evening recreation will end in 13 minutes . Thank you . Did it work ? I don 't know how long it takes for the injection to leave you , - but there a day was long enough ... - Why did I do this , Jonas ? On the walk here I was thinking of how I would scold you . How I would say : " Oh , it 's fine for you to break the rules , because you are chosen ... " When I thought about telling you , I just I ... I began to think about you . Was this okay ? Do you feel anything ? - It feels like ... - Fiona . - What do you feel ? - I do not know , I don 't ... have words to describe it . Warm ... ? Does it feel warm ? - Warm ... ? - Does it feel nice ? No , I 'm ... I 'm on night shift , I need to ... I don 't feel right , Jonas . I need to go and get my injection , I need to go to work . - What was that ? - Fiona , there is more . So much more . I remembered it now . I had dreamed of her . When I was younger . I told my parents ... " It was the stirrings " they said . " Everyone had them . " " Medication would stop them . Anything could be fixed . " ( ? ) " Precision of language " and the teacher said : - " That 's right , Lily " . - Very Good ! Jonas ... Just in time for feelings . - Lily was telling us how she ... - Where 's Gabe ? Uncertainly he was returned to the nurturing center . - What happened ? - He failed his test of maturity . Again . I couldn 't ask for another extension , so I 'll have to release him into elsewhere . - Release him ... ? - We certainly gave it a best try , didn 't we ? - But he 's family . - Precision of language , please ! Sit down . Eat with us . I just need to rest for a while . I hadn 't been wrong , this was wrong . They hadn 't eliminated murder , they brought it home ! They just called it by a different name . Father , he didn 't know any better . I did . Jonas , what are you doing ? It 's against the rules to leave your Community this late . Asher , there is something I have to do , it 's right , but it 's sort of against the rules . If it 's right thing to do ... How can it be against the rules ? There are things I 've learned that you don 't know , that you can 't know , - not because it 's your fault ... - Jonas you need to go back to your family unit ! But that 's the point ! It isn 't my family ! And neither is yours ! - Asher , I gotta go . - Jonas , listen ! - Get out of my way . - Jonas , listen ! What are you ... ? Giver ! Giver ! Wake up . - I have to be sleeping to wake up . - Something can be done . - Something can be done ! - What do you propose to do ? All the memories back and back and back and back can be returned . I need to leave the Community , I need to find the boundary of memories . - And then ? - And then cross it ! - No more discussion . - Slowly ... - Gabe is in danger . - Slowly . I can 't wait anymore ! Something must be done ! If you had that map , then why didn 't you try to leave ? I was waiting , for someone like you . You 're the reason we have a chance , so ... The plan will be for you to go and for me to stay . If you did cross this boundary ... And if the memories are set free , all of the pain that you felt all the ... Confusion , the chaos , it would all return ! - So you have to stay to help them ? - Yes . And for my daughter . That 's what you would have wanted . - Your daughter ... ? - Rosemary . Now : your friend if he truly saw the Triangle of Rocks ... Bring up Jonas activity for the past year as well . - So Asher came directly to you ? - Yes . What was Jonas 's disposition at the evening meal ? Dissatisfied . Anxious . Indignant . Setup a communication with the Receiver of memory . We 're not permitted to see into the receiver 's residence . - We can only transmit . - Well then we shall only transmit . If you go , head towards the triangle , away from the other communities . That will lead to boundary of memories . Please , Standby for a transmission . - I apologize for your intrusion . - I accept your apology . We have a problem : receiver in training is missing , And he physically attacked his friend , Asher . - He did ? That 's serious . - Do you know where Jonas is ? I do not . Well Thank you very much for ... helping us to narrow down the possibilities . - I 'll contact you if he comes here . - Only if it 's not in imposition . Thank you . He is lying ... - Talk ! - They are going to kill Gabe . I 'm leaving , I 'm leaving tonight and I 'm going to take him with me . Jonas not yet , you 're not ready . When they decided to kill Gabe , they decided I was ready . I like this map , don 't mess it up , I 'll be wanting it back . You don 't mind if I accelerate your training a bit , do you ? You 'd think that someone who is the keeper of emotions , then I would be better ... Well ... I love you , Jonas . Look ... There it is . You have the courage ... Let me give you the strength . Can I just ... Attention all community residents . The Receiver in training has been reported missing from his dwelling . Please be alert , you may be in danger . Group 1 , will start from the edge . Then Group 2 , from the center . Now ... like this . Welcome to the Nurturing Center . - Shall I convey the others ? - Yes . Jonas ! I heard an alert . What 's going on ? Hey , where 's Gabe ? Is he here ? - Is he in one of these ? - If he is back then , he 'll be with uncertains on - Restricted floor . - Show me where . Fiona ! Please . They are downstairs , come on . Jonas was chosen for the most important position in our community . He was asked if he was strong enough . It turned out he was not . Instead , he is a rebel . He must be stopped . By you . When you find him ... Take him . - Gabe is in danger . - Jonas , he is fine , I 'll show you . No , he is not fine . He should be here . - Fiona : I 'm leaving , tonight . - " Leaving " ? - What do you mean ? - I 'm taking Gabe . We are leaving the Community . I want you to come with us . I don 't have the words to describe it . Fiona there is more . So much more . What are they doing ? - Fiona : what do you feel ? - I don 't have the words to describe it . Attention Nurturers . Please secure your work area and immediately report to the newborn 's nursery , to allow for security search procedure . Promptly report all sightings at the nearest security kiosk . Thank you . Fiona , we got to go now ! You , me and Gabe ! Jonas , I can 't what about my family unit and the other new children ? I can 't leave them . This the only way . This is the only way to make everything okay . I can 't go . When I get there , you 'll understand . - I 'll Come back for you . - Jonas ! Come back ! Now go , Jonas ! Hey freeze , stop ! Subject lost to the edge . Search terminated . And I asked him why he was out so late . He seemed angry . I didn 't understand why , but I wanted to help him . Then it hit me , and at first time ... I can tell why you 've been acting this way , your injections levels are extremely low . I can correct this . " Friends forever " right ... ? And then we will addressed what 's happened . When I went over the edge , we shouldn 't have made it . This was a miracle . The Giver had talked about them . He told me that I could draw strength from the memories . I knew , by giving them to Gabe , I could protect them . Cut your finger and put a little blood on this apple . When you leave in the morning , put the apple over on the sensor . I 've been doing it for months , since worked every single time . What has he taught you ... ? A dwelling is not a " home " . This the only way to make everything okay . Gabe is in danger . What they are going to do to him is really bad . I want you to come with us . When I get there , you 'll understand . I 'll come back for you . Yes ... Careful ... Careful . I apologize ... For failing again . I don 't think you failed . I think you succeeded . With your plan ... Ever since the girl was released you haven 't been the same . I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you . It would have fresh start , to two of you have work together ... Which is seems you have . We will find Jonas . Jonas , our Receiver of Memories , lost to the Edge . Jonas ... ! Jonas ... ! - How did they know Jonas is gone ? - We must not says his names anymore . - I will . - You must keep quiet now , Lily . And hippo is really " an elephant " . What I 'm about to tell you , you must never repeat to anyone . - I don 't believe Jonas is lost . - But the ceremony of Loss ... I 'm sure of it . I don 't expect you to understand , but you must know that Jonas has become dangerous . He must be stopped . He must not get beyond the Triangle of Rocks . What you want me to do ? You know , Jonas , I want you to find him . And then ... I want you to lose him . Power Depleted . Jonas ... - What are you doing ... ? - Asher please , let us go . I can 't . I 'm supposed to ... To what ? To lose you . Asher ... if you 're my friend ... If you ever were my friend ... can you please somehow trust me ? Trust me now . I do trust you , Jonas . Come on , please ... Jonas ... ! You found him ! I did . For the good of all of us ... I beg you , to finish this . It 's finished . Hey . It 's okay ... Nothing the Giver had shown me , had prepared me for the voices in my head . Screaming at me to stop . But I knew that Fiona will be punished for helping me . Asher , for letting me go . The only way to help them , to keep them alive ... Was to get to the boundary . If it even existed . I strengthened Gabe with memories of having enough and knowing joy . It was the memory of Fiona that kept me going . Fiona ? I 've taken care of everything . We 've arranged for your release . It will be a nice ceremony . Now you get some rest . - I felt things . - What ? - I know that there is something more . - Fiona ... Something missing from our lives . No , not " missing " , something that has been stolen from me and from you . I do not know what it is exactly . But Jonas does . I had felt things . And they were warm ... And they were nice . And they were beautiful . I have felt things . I have felt things ! I have felt things ... ! Where is the Tower , Gabe ? Tower should be here ... You can stop this ... Stop what ? If you don 't want to see it , sit down with the other elders . Or close your eyes ! Ceremony of release to elsewhere . Come on , Fiona . You 're uncomfortable ? I 'm not uncomfortable , I 'm afraid . You don 't have to be afraid . You know me . I will be very gentle , I promise . Okay ... ? Her name was Rosemary . She was my daughter . - I loved her ... - Precision of language . I could not be more precise . Do you know what that 's like ? To love someone ? I do . I cried . I felt sorrow ... I 've sang , danced ... I felt real joy ... Then you should know better then anyone . You have seen children starv ... Yes ... You 've seen people stabbing each others neck ... Just for the view . You know what it is peoples like when men blow each other up . Yes ... - Over a simple land , sand ... - I do , I do . - But ... - And yet ... And yet ! You and Jonas want to open that door again . - Bring all that back . - If you only could see possibilities ... - But why ? - Of Love ! With love comes faith , comes hope ... Love is just passion that can turn . It turns into contempt ! And murder ! We could choose better ! People are weak . People are selfish . When people have the freedom to choose ... They choose wrong . Every single time . That 's a sledge ... Loss ... and the pain ... Music , joy ... These all are impossible , beautiful feeling of love . Your son , he felt that . That girl ... - She is felted . - That 's enough . We are living a life of shadows . Of echoes , of fake distant whispers of what once made us real . Excuse me for one second , Fiona . We must continue . I wish I had been there when the memories returned . They were the truth . The elders and their rules were the lie . So I do not apologize . I knew Fiona was safe . That I 'd see her again . And that I held the future there in my arms . The Giver had led us here . To this house ... It was real . From far behind me , from the place I had left ... I thought I heard music too . Perhaps it was only an echo . But it was enough . It would lead us all home .

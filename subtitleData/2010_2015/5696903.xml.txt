 I 'm not Beth . I 'm not Beth . I 'm not Beth . Shh . Why would one of us be killing us ? What is wrong with her ? Bad breath . Bat shit crazy . Does she know about me ? About my kids ? How do you know you didn 't just bring her right to my doorstep ? Because she 's impaled with rebar and I wouldn 't do that . I have been living this nightmare much longer than you have , Sarah . I explained . I have a family to protect . I do what I can . Right . You provide financially . Yeah , so you wanted that money Beth was holding . Your self-defense fund . You 're right , I was gonna steal it and run , but I can 't do that , because I have a family too , Alison . My daughter . - Your daughter ? - Yeah . Her name 's Kira . And I meant to be seeing her today , but there 's this killer up my ass , so ... Wait , is she your biological child or adopted like mine ? Mine . Why ? Don 't you think you should have told us about that before ? Er , why would I do that ? I 'm telling you now because we have to deal with this . Yeah ? Beth was on this killer 's hit list and now I am . Well what am I supposed to do about it ? How can I help ? Be available . I may need you somehow . Wow , rich , man ! This looks like a new blade inset in a much older handle . So the fish is a bitch . Symbiotically speaking , like a universal way back symbol of fecundity . But these wings though , they 're ... Seriously , what is she on about ? Quiet , she 's just weird . Sorry , sorry , sorry . Okay , going on a tangent there . If she 's not dead , we need to find her . Find out what she knows . Are you mad ? She 's a homicidal maniac . But we need to find out who she is , Sarah . She 's ... She found us , she 's got answers . The only way I 'm gonna do that is go back to being a cop . No . No way , you 're not going back to being Beth . Impersonating a dead officer , that 's like a whole new crime . I think I 'm safest with the cops , to be honest with you . Did that actually just come out of your mouth ? Look . Art 's already looking for the killer . I shadow him as Beth , I let them figure out what has happened to her and when I find out I can jump off and deal . Deal ? I 'm beginning to realize crazy is genetic . Well , yeah , bad brain chemistry can be genetic . Um , but environment , that 's individual , right ? I mean , that 's the whole nature-nurture question right there . Okay , let 's talk nature . Out of nine so far , one 's a psycho who killed four others . One committed suicide , one is a bloody soccer mum , and then there 's you . My crazy sister is sane by comparison . Thanks , Fe ... I think this might help us figure out where she 's coming from . - So I 'll look into it . Ah , police business . Art 's got a lead . Okay ! Hey you didn 't show this to Alison by any chance , did you ? You joking ? She 'd crap her Lululemon . Got Alison on standby . Make sure Jimbo wears his seat belt . You 're sending the kids to your parents on a school morning . Well , they 're staying the night . That 's not an answer . Well , you didn 't pose it as a question , did you , Donnie ? Okay , why ? Why did you cancel all their activities ? I just need some time to myself . You have your usual Thursday night drinks with clients , right ? Yes . So I 'll see you when you come crashing in at 3 : 00 a.m. , now , won 't I ? I don 't crash in ... One time . Oh crap ! Sorry . I 'm jumpy too . How 's your head ? Probably about the same as yours . It 's a good day to be alive , Beth . My kids thank you , even my ex thanks you . - Yeah , don 't mention it . - I didn 't , they did . I got a present for you . Our killer made a pit stop . That 's his bike . - They got him ? - No , but we got a witness . Just follow the bloody brick road . Hey , there he is , our walking wounded . You all good , Art ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Hey , glad you 're okay . We 're gonna get this guy . Don 't worry , all right ? So your guy wore gloves , no prints , but he has not exactly covered his tracks . Go take a look . Self-surgery . The guy is what ? Military ? Looks like it 's gotta hurt . Oh , and the witness is ready . - Art , you wanna take him ? - No . Come on . I slept through the whole thing . I can 't believe I did . Trevor came into my room and it was dark , and he was all wet ... With blood . He said it was an angry angel . Hey , Trevor . Can you tell me what the angry angel looked like ? Beth ? The person in your bathroom , was a woman ? Is that possible ? Let me talk to him . Yeah , sure . It 's okay , darling . I 'm not her . She said you would come . Pick a color . Red . R-E-D . Pick one . That one . Wait , let me see that . - Can I keep this ? - Yes . What you got there ? Souvenir . What the hell ? Hey , can you bag this ? It 's okay , sweetie . It 's okay . Yes , once again 8 : 00 , before her bedtime . - Is that my mum ? - No . Did you just tell her it wasn 't me ? Sarah , why are you calling ? If you don 't show after all this anticipation ... Just making sure we 're still on . Well , we are at this end . Yeah , I 'll be there . Can I talk to her ? You can talk to her tonight . If you let her down , that 's it . I won 't let you see her again . I said I 'll be there . So you all have copies of the fortune teller . Eye witness says we got it wrong . Jane Doe 's killer is female . About Beth 's size . As for the Jane Doe , it isn 't easy reconstructing a skull that 's gone through a gravel crusher , but , we do have cause of death . This hole . 223 caliber . So , we have a long range , high-powered weapon . Name me one homicide ever pinned on a female sniper . How 's our profile ? Female killers tend to suffer from chronic detachment , isolation breeds sociopaths . This song , " Fearfully and wonderfully made . " She 's a religious fanatic . The stick figures , the doll 's head , the fortune teller ... Early childhood development issues , could be extreme abuse . Yes , but she 's also careful in her way . No prints on any of this so far . And the DNA evidence ? On rush , but we 're still a week away from knowing if they match anyone on file . Nothing on Jane Doe 's prints ? Her hand didn 't give us a match ? No , no . It did not . Look , the bottom line is we 're chasing a calculated female killer who loves playing games . Like these fortune tellers . Angie ... Certain choices , give certain answers . Every choice is a different death , could be threats , could be existing kills , they might mean something when combined with the numbers . Childs ? Childs ? Call for you . - Detective Childs ... - No , you 're not . Beth is dead , isn 't she ? What do you want from me ? You could have killed me , but here we are . - You didn 't feel it ? - What ? We have a connection . Er , you mean when I stuck that piece of rebar in your liver ? How 's that going ? I need to know who you are . Let 's meet again . I never got your name . I never got yours . Helena . And last name ? You 're doing police work but how long can that last ? When the real police find me you are me and I 'm you . We 're both the victim and the cop . Yeah , that would be bad for both of us . So come see me , discuss ... I already gave you directions . Hey , come here . The numbers , they 're addresses . Okay , 1 7 is the street number of the quarry where we found Jane Doe . Yeah , the rooming house . Shooting scene . The kid 's house . Even the precinct . Everywhere we 've been . Except one . 10-24 and GPS gives one address with that street number , 10 minutes from the kid 's house , Lake Point Road . Oh , I know that place . Lot of squatters around there . - Let 's check it out . - Hold it . Wait for emergency tactical , huh ? This is a probable sniper , so let ' em sweep it first before you go in . Got it ? Hey , don 't worry . Let 's do this . I 'm parked over here so ... No , no , no , after last night , we stick together , come on . Whoa , Beth ! Rough night ? Okie-doke then . Out . What ? Anybody else feel like they have a target on their back ? - All clear . - Copy . Okay , I 'll take you guys in for a closer look . You 're gonna love it . Over here , detectives . Looks like more self-surgery . Can 't be long till she bleeds out . Holy shit ! It 's the same figures as the fortune teller . She 's saying she 's a serial killer ? Could be her single victim . Our Jane Doe , over and over again ? Or she just draws like a third grader . Is this her ? Or her next victim . Next victim . Detective Childs . Hey , it 's me . - Paul ? - Oh ! - Hello , Paul . - How are you doing ? Oh , not too good . - I got beat up . - What ? - What happened ? - Please come and get me out of here . She led us here . She wanted us to see this . Maybe a wild goose chase . Wasting our time . No . She had a reason . Okay , let 's let forensics have this . I hope you don 't have dinner plans . Yeah , I 'll be right with you . Is it my imagination or does Cosima have bigger breasts than you ? There 's no way I can make dinner with Kira tonight . Well , you 've got to . I can 't , I 'm stuck with Art and this bitch is right on top of me . I can lead her straight to Kira . I know , but Mrs. S gave you an ultimatum , she 's gonna cut you off . Rock and a hard place here , Fe . Yeah , your permanent address . I do have one really idiotic idea . Oh , good . I need to be at two places at once , yeah ? - Yeah . - Well ... If anybody can do that , we can . Are you effing serious ? Yeah , suddenly I am . What happened ? - Is she okay ? - Yeah , she 's okay , she 's fine . That doesn 't sound okay . Sarah needs your help with her daughter . I 'll get the drawings out to my criminal psych guy . Where 's missing persons on our Jane Doe ? - Nothing local . - Well , widen the net . How wide ? North America . Whoa , quick change . Huh ? Your whole look , it 's cleaned right up . - Looks way better . - Keep it in your pants , Raj . Uh , sorry ... Guys , what the hell ? Nice to know someone 's having fun . Maggie Chen . I 'm sorry , but she wants me to impersonate her in front of her own daughter . - Who she hasn 't seen in almost a year . - Ten months . This is terrible parenting , Felix . I mean , that poor child . I don 't think you understand the situation here . If Sarah misses tonight , then she may never get Kira back . I 'm sorry , but a request like this ... Maybe the child is better off with your foster mother . Excuse me ? Sarah is out there risking her life , playing cat and mouse with killer clone so that your kids don 't end up orphans and you think that she should lose her child for that . Yeah , I think you need to step up here , sister . Well , I did just play Annelle in " Steel Magnolias " . - Seriously ? - Mmm-hmm . Glendale Community Theater . Annelle . An ... Oh , my God ! - The Daryl Hannah part ? - Yeah . It 's terrible casting . Um , it was actually very good acting , Felix . Trust me , Sarah 's no stretch . I got great reviews . From the whole neighborhood , I 'm sure . " The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain . " Okay , Eliza , holy shit ! We need to pull a full reverse Pygmalion here . Guess what ? My crime psych guy says , biblically messed up or not , woman-on-woman means it 's got to be personal , whether it 's her first or fifteenth kill . Yeah , no . That makes sense . So we 're back to Jane Doe and who she was to Jane Death . Something 's got to give and when it does ... Yeah , right behind you . These are your worst clothes ? Well , I 'm sorry , mate , but I don 't shop second-hand . No ! No ! It 's ... My God , no ! It 's not " mate , " all right ? It 's more like , um ... It 's like , mate . - Mate . - Yeah ? 'Ello , mate . Yeah , um , that 's better . But , look , you 're gonna have to get past Mrs. S , so you 've really got to play the , um , the dreary history there , you know ? I mean you basically won 't talk . This shirt is all wrong . Hey , hey , hey ! Not hey ! You 're a punk ! Be one . Oi ! Detective Childs . There 's a visitor for you . Hey , hey , hey ! What 're you doing here ? You said come get you . What happened ? You okay ? Yeah ! Yeah , no , I 'm fine , really ! You didn 't sound fine and you don 't look fine . Come on , I took the rest of the day off , whatever you need , okay ? Uh , no , no , no . No ! - Paul ? - Paul , I can 't . - Everything all right here ? - Does she seem all right to you ? Okay , take it easy . First day back , she gets beat up . No wonder she wants to leave . - Oh , what the hell are you talking about ? - No , no , no , no , no ! Paul , please . Art , I got this . Do you ? What am I doing here ? Sorry I overreacted , I ... I didn 't mean , literally , come get me this second . Then what did you mean ? Seriously , you 're like a completely different person these days . I 'm sorry . It 's this case . It 's a bitch . I got upset so I asked you to come get me . I didn 't say I minded . Look , we need to spend some time together , figure out what 's suddenly going on with us because ... Most of it I like ... A lot . Paul ... You get back . So , the woman Beth shot and Helena are connected . Holy watershed ! Oaky , Beth probably shot Maggie Chen on purpose . She never told us anything about this . Yeah , she never told her partner either . I can 't keep doing this , Cosima , Helena was here , she was Beth . She 's going to get us both busted unless I meet her ... - Alone ! - Oh my God , bad idea . Yeah . She thinks we have a connection . - Do you ? - Yeah , we 're clones . Right ! So , what do the cops know ? She 's a churchy psychopath , duh . It 's personal . She 's a loner , probably abused as a child . Okay , so the fish reads Christian . And crafted on to a weapon , a personal crusade . Great . Is that it ? You know , when I 'm seeing this branded onto Maggie Chen , I 'm thinking that she 's not a lone warrior . To extreme creationist types we would be abominations . Like not God 's children but Satan 's . So they hate us . And she 's killing us even though she is identical to us . Well , but if you were a messed up , abused , loner whose faith compels you to belong and somebody that you trusted told you that this was the way to redeem yourself in the eyes of God , I mean ... Yeah , I might become an angry angel too . Okay , got it . Thanks . Something you want to tell me ? About Paul ? No . I 've got him wrapped around my little finger . What 's he talking about ? Leaving ? We just got you back , Beth . No , he doesn 't know what he 's talking about . - Things are just messy right now . - Yeah , I heard that . - But we don 't bring that shit in here , right ? - I know . It 's so freaking embarrassing , don 't worry , it won 't happen again . I thought you two are calling it quits . Yeah , we were , but now we 're trying to work it out . You know how things go . Right . Let 's get back on track . This killer , you had a close quarters run-in with her , did you get anything else ? Something she said ? If she 'd said anything , I would 've known she 's a woman . Yeah . We 'll check with Beckwith . - She 's making progress on Jane Doe . - Mmm . Should have facial reconstruction soon . Great . Detective Childs . Things must be getting uncomfortable there for you now . Helena , you 've forgot something . Your friend Maggie . Oh , you 're a terrible detective . Beth figured that out . Well , Beth shot her , not me , if it 's revenge you 're after . It 's not about revenge , it 's about you . Right , we have a connection . - You want to tell me about that ? - In person . You have my invitation . My name is Detective Beth Childs . I murdered Margaret Chen . It wasn 't an accident . I shot her on purpose . I 'm gasping for a fag . No , you 're not , Sarah never smoked . Okay , it 's curtain time . So , just remember that an insult is a greeting but you 're trying not to lose your temper , yeah ? Mm-hmm . And , um ... Wait ! Um ... Thanks . Okay . - Over slouching , you 're over slouching . - Shut up . Now you 've got her . Oh , hi , Mrs. S. Not driving a nice , new Jag today then ? - It 's in the shop . - Mmm-hmm . You 're going to let me see my daughter or what ? What 're you gaping at ? Something I can do ? You ever fight a woman ? Depends , business or pleasure ? Look , they do say , crazy makes you strong . But women , they look different , fight different , smell different . This woman is a trained sniper . But Beth taking her for a man , that flies with you ? Mmm . The whole time it feels like she 's got something else chewing on her leg . You know , civilian shootings are hard to shake . Maybe she 's back too soon . I don 't know if that 's even it . Where is she anyway ? Could be she 's just working it out with her boyfriend right ? Yeah , yeah , could be . - What ? - Nothing . So what now , invisible ink ? Mind the store , Angie . Maybe I should come with ... Come on Art , what 's up ? You 'll know when I do . Kira , your mum 's waiting . Hurry up , come on . There she is , look , she 's here . She 's won 't bite , love . What ? You shy now or something ? Is that for me ? Can I see it ? Oh . How about a cuppa in the kitchen , yeah ? Wow . You give us a hug . I 'm sorry , we haven 't seen each other in a long time , but we can change all that , see each other all the time . You 're not my mother . Don 't be silly . Of course I 'm your mum . Who else would I be ? You just look like her . It 's still me , Kira . What do you call me ? - Monkey . - What else ? Monkey ... Bum ... Face ? Where 's my mum ? Art , if you 're hearing this , you found a body . It 's not Beth . It 's me . My name is Sarah Manning and you 're about the only person I trust to figure the whole thing out . Kira , your mother couldn 't be here right now . Why ? Police ! Stay inside . Shit . Because she 's out there right now , doing something very brave . She 's making sure everything is safe , so you two can be together . I 'm unarmed . Turn around . Turn around , all the way . Kneel ! I 'm guessing you know how . This isn 't necessary . Kneel down ! You 're different than the others . Yeah , I am . You want to talk , let 's talk . I think I 'm dying . Yeah , I think I 'll watch . Where did you come from ? I came out the woodwork . Where did you come from ? - God sent me . - Right . So you don 't know either . You don 't know God . This God ? This God ? The one branded on your friend Maggie Chen ? Maggie helped make you . And she saw the light and came to our side . Beth killed her to protect us . I can save you . Right , ' cause we have a connection . I can see a light in you . There 's a light in all of us . No ! No ! The others , poor copies of God 's image of human beings . But not you ? You 're special ? They told you you were the original , didn 't they ? Your people ... It 's not true what they said . We 're genetic identicals . - Let me save you . - You , me , that German you killed , we 're all made the same . Whoever told you different hates you as much as they hate us . You 're wrong . What happened to you , Helena ? Stay back . Can you feel it ? Beth ? Beth , are you in there ? Go , run ! You don 't feel it ? - There 's no one here . - You 're here . Why ? Beth ? The apartment of the woman you killed ? What the hell are you thinking ? How can you be my Auntie Alison ? My mum doesn 't have any sisters . My mum doesn 't even have a mum . Well , it 's very complicated . Um , but , Kira ... I 'm sorry about this but it 's very important that you keep this a secret . Right ? Promise ? Getting on for bed time , Kira love . Up you go , get your PJs . Pinkies . Bye , mummy . Scoot . Thanks for everything . Well you kept your word . You showed up . I mean Kira . She 's well and that 's , uh , down to you . Sarah . I 'm just , uh ... I 'm not used to an honest word on this subject . Um , I 'd like to do this again , sooner rather than later . I 'm not opposed , as long as you take it slowly . So , I 'll be by tomorrow to walk her home from school . Straight home . Well , all right then . Well , unleash the doves , world peace must be right around the corner . Piss off , you . Well , aren 't you full of surprises ? You passed . You turned S 's head for your encore . Well , that 's something . Uh-oh . - Kira knew right away . - No ! Oh , shite ! I just don 't get it . It doesn 't make any sense to me . Just explain to us why you were at the home of Maggie Chen . Like I said , I was taking a walk , to clear my head , I found myself there . - You just found yourself there . - Yeah . Yes or no ! Is there a connection between the Maggie Chen shooting death and this Jane Doe homicide ? None . Well you called this meeting , Beth . What the hell are we doing here ? After this Chen thing , I came back to prove that I could , but , I 'm not doing anybody any good , so . I quit . After all we 've done for you ? Yeah , I appreciate it , but , uh ... But you bail . Why ? What is it with you ? Walking out is not the answer , Childs . So how does this go ? Something like this ? What 'd they do to me ? This is about Paul right ? We think Beth was spying on him . She wasn 't messing around , was she ? Maybe it 's time to find out where Paul works . What happened to your scar ? Why were you in my vanity ? Tell me what 's in the box . I don 't know who you are . Sarah , I thought you were dead . Is someone trying to hurt us ? Why 'd you ask that ? How could you do that to her ?

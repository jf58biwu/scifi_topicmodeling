 A Hekatoncheires ! Briareos ! Briareos ... Is this really our paradise ? All right ! The forecast was all wrong ! This is perfect vacation weather ! Deunan . You ready yet ? not yet ... All set ! What do you think ? I guess . - Let 's go . - What ? ! That 's all ? ! It 's just an overnight trip . Why are you so excited ? We hardly ever get time off . We should enjoy it to the fullest ! and order me a ton of tropical fruit ... Something the matter ? No . Let 's go . Poseidon Air M727 in Sector Charlie-Two-Three . This is OAS Control . You are deviating from your flight plan . Correct your course immediately . respond . What 's the matter ? Poseidon Air Flight M727 is veering further and further from its flight plan . Try raising them again . This is OAS Control . M727 ? Course-correct immediately ! this is OAS Control ! Lance . Your request for leave time is hereby rescinded . Huh ? ! What for ? ! Return to HQ at once and prepare for an assault . - It 's a classified P4 operation . - This sucks ! has been hijacked . the plane in question altered its course and is now headed straight for Olympus . Who 's behind it ? A faction of Human Liberation Front followers has claimed responsibility . They demand the release of all imprisoned compatriots within three hours . That 's crazy . Are they gonna seek asylum in Switzerland or something ? The crew and passengers are being held hostage ... 3000 in all . so I need a Hekatoncheires to lead the assault . You and Deunan will handle this mission . That is all . if only he wasn 't a Hekaton . This is no time for nonsense . Get your asses back here ! the Human Liberation Front is a group of human supremacists right ? They 're hard-line reactionary conservatives . I doubt bioroids ' lives mean anything to them . That 's horrible . They 're just genetically engineered people who 've been given thought control and lifespan modification . They 're basically no different from humans ... It 's true that bioroids and humans are made of the same stuff . But there are always people who 'll notice the slightest of differences and get it into their heads that they 're superior to the rest . It 's so stupid ... That 's how rare pureblooded humans have become . They 're so vocal about preservation because there are so few left . Not everyone can be a she-devil with no need for an escort . It 's ironic ... their new lives here have left most of them with diminished crisis-management capabilities and more uniformity than ever . it 's just as the Legislative Bureau pointed out . The fact that some fundamentalists have banded together to demand the reinstitution of an autonomous human society can be seen as a natural response . Even if their methods are sickeningly simpleminded and extreme ? Simpleminded and extreme " makes it all the more captivating for people . Perhaps this city has become too utopian for them . Denying humans such factors as distress and anxiety will only cause them to lose self-control . No doubt . this is actually the end result of human hopes and endeavors for such a world . And we bioroids have had a helping hand in those endeavors . what must we do to help humans live the most like humans ? I have no doubt they 're fully aware that their demand for the release of all their compatriots is infeasible . or their demand could simply be a bluff meant to confuse us while they actually use the passenger plane for a terrorist act . it appears everyone on board is a bioroid . There 's not a single human . then . I take it their target is Tartaros ? Sir . The genes used to produce bioroids are cryogenically preserved there . They may see special significance in using the lives of the bioroids aboard to strike Tartaros . we 'll deploy our intercept system as well . Sir . What 's the matter ? Don 't tell me you 're nervous ? Maybe I am ... Briareos . take me to get something tasty . right ? Do you have a place in mind ? A restaurant Hitomi mentioned the other day ! She said it has a fantastic night view ! but ... I 'm not sure a place like that can satisfy your voracious appetite . Your vocal filters have no tact at all ! There . Now that 's the Deunan I know . It 's time . Now let 's get this over with and enjoy the rest of our break ! Right on ! We 'll attach from below . There should be emergency exits under the wings . Okay ! No signs of any passengers . It 's almost like a ghost plane ... It 's strange that there 's not even a single person ... Could they have all been moved to a single location ? Any bio-readings ? Yes . I 'm still picking up 3000 life forms as we speak . That 's a relief . At least we know all the hostages are alive . anyway . What 's the plan ? Securing the cockpit first is one option ... I 'm concerned about the hostages . Let 's check all the floors for now . Just ... right ? Right ! Who the hell ... ? ! you know ! Of course we know . We also know it 's a low-level one . Wh-Who are you guys ? ! A rowdy hooligan and a combat cyborg from ES.W.A.T. But what does it matter to you ? ES.W.A. T ? ! I-I 'll do anything ! Just don 't kill me ! Sheesh . I just wanted to ask a few questions . you know . Although a petty one . You get anything ? A winning ticket . Lucky boy ! What 's on it ? Gina was griping earlier while hitting up the Poseidon branch offices . She says they 're hiding behind the privacy protection laws to keep a lid on the detailed passenger manifest . She always has to play by the rules ... - Is the manifest on there ? - Yeah . The question is why does the HLF have information that Poseidon is in charge of ? Easy . There 's a third party secretly involved . I think so too . The HLF got ahold of that classified info through this third party and then used it to concoct a hijacking incident . It 's empty everywhere I checked . Likewise . But I 'm still picking up bio-readings . all right ... - Only one place left to check ... - The cockpit . Auto-pilot ... Lance was right . The destination 's been changed to Tartaros in Olympus . they also kindly locked the program to prevent anyone else from overriding it . What is this ? Wait ! A bomb ? ! Yeah . An old type that 's set off by vibration . they 're tough to disarm ... What do we do ? watching how things unfold . what should we do ? Repay the favor twofold for snaring us in this trap . Deunan . Go get your Guges and settle the score . Huh ? By myself ? but none of this 'll matter if the plane gets blown up from the outside when we catch who 's responsible . I always prefer to have added insurance . I 'll stay here and work on disarming this . Get going ! Briareos ! Don 't worry . I just succeeded in disarming the bomb in the cockpit . But it might 've been set to automatically send out a call when disarmed . These guys are meticulous . Be careful . They 're nearby . I know . Just leave it to me . A floating pillbox ? ! Camouflage won 't help you ! Briareos ! The plan 's off ! Things are starting to get ugly here ! Briareos ! How dare you ! Deunan ! Have you forgotten ? ! A Hekatoncheires can operate an entire aircraft carrier single-handedly . no problem . But ! The people 's lives take top priority . Just focus on the task in front of you ! - It 's charging right for us ! - Calm down ! That Landmate 's speed comes at the expense of its armor ! One hit and we win ! Why would you throw your weapon away ? You don 't stand a chance now ! That 's checkmate . I demand a lawyer and a lawful interrogation ! you know ! Save the song and dance for after you 're on the ground . all the other guys on my team are a lot meaner looking than me ! It 's a miracle ! even with three engines gone ! That 's a Hekatoncheires for you . If you 'll excuse me . Briareos ! You 're okay ! What a relief ! all the hostages appear to be safe as well . Deia ? What are you doing here ? I offer you my gratitude . This is Mr. Eurys . He 's in charge of the next-gen bioroid project . Thank you for taking back the 3000 frozen embryos . the hostages ... were these ? ! whether it appears human or not . Sounds kinda complicated ... We 'll put them to good use for the development of next-gen bioroids who will help foster a more secure and perfect paradise ... huh ... Okay ! It 's vacation do-over time ! but we can still check out that restaurant with the great night view ! Sheesh ... It 's really coming down . Huh . Only now is the forecast actually right ... Wha ? Huh ? What ? ! There goes your night view . Guess it 's canned food at home for us . This sucks !

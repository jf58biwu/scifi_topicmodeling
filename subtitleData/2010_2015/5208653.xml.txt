 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , Inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . Barbie : I linked up with a bookie . Taking bets ? Making sure that people paid what they owed . When I get home , you better be gone . Big jim : You ever consider A career in law enforcement ? Both : The pink stars are falling . Shh ... ( walkie-talkie feedback ) norrie ? Norrie , where are you ? Right behind you , genius . I didn 't realize that crashing with a farm kid Meant that I had to get up at the ass-crack of dawn . Come on , it 's about the dome . Really ? Is it gone ? Are we finally free ? You 'll see . I 've been thinking about our seizures . About what we said . " the pink stars are falling . " Not yet , but if the dome is really sending out messages , Then we 're like human receivers . We can catch a few of the transmissions on our own , But when we get too close to each other ... ( feedback screeching ) Feedback . Joe , why would the dome only talk to us ? I don 't know . But when I came out here to find out , I saw this . ( laughs ) Yeah , right ? Monarch butterflies aren 't even in season . They shouldn 't be anywhere near chester 's mill This time of year . Maybe the dome sent them . Maybe it 's trying to tell us that the dome 's just a cocoon , And when it finally goes away , We 'll all get to be something new . You realize most caterpillars are actually eaten Before they turn into butterflies ? ( both laugh ) ( birds chirping ) ( latch clacks open loudly ) ( water dripping ) ( panting ) Mr. Rennie . Oh , thank god . What took you so long ? Feeling better there , darling ? Better ? I 've been down here all night . Why haven 't you gotten the police yet ? Mr. Rennie , You 're gonna get me out of here , right ? Of course . Soon as you tell me exactly what it is You 're doing down here . He 's been keeping me prisoner ! Who ? Your son . Junior ? No . Why would ... Why would ... ? Why would he do something like that ? Because he 's insane . You got to get me out of here before he comes back . ( car horn honking outside ) Big jim ? Please , please ! I just , uh , I just need to think on this a little bit . No , no , no ! You can 't leave me down here ! You can 't ... You ... No , wait ! Wait ! Help ! Please ! No ! Help ! ( screaming ) : Help ! Help ! No ! ( screaming ) ( screaming continues ) ( horn continues honking ) Damn it , coggins , I thought we were done . What are you doing here ? Jim . I received a very troubling message . No ! I have to tell you . What message ? From the lord almighty . He whispered one word to me . Moab . Moab ? Moab . You better check the batteries in your hearing aid , coggins , 'cause that 's not even a word . Jim ! Moab was a place . A very wicked place . Much like chester 's mill . I 'm warning you , reverend . Stay away from me . Jim . Ji ... ( door slams ) ( hearing add feedback screeching ) Deep , distorted voice : Moab . ( feedback screeching ) moab . ( static crackles ) Moab ... Moab . ( feedback screeching , static crackling ) Moab . Joe : Over here . Norrie : Look at them all . ( laughs ) : Oh , my god , there 's more . Where did they all come from ? So beautiful . Barbie ? What is this ? Isn 't it amazing ? ( birds chirping ) ( laughs ) Huh . These guys are suddenly paying attention to us ? Look . They 're bussing in more soldiers ? No , civilians . Hey , that 's frank ! Norrie : Who ? Joe : My cousin . He went away to college before the dome came down . Okay , it 's been over a week since this thing came down . Military hasn 't let anybody near here . So why bus the families in now ? Haven 't you ever been to camp ? They 're finally giving us our own visitors ' day . Julia : We have official confirmation From military representatives That at 10 : 00 a.M. This morning , The people of chester 's mill will be permitted To visit with their loved ones on the outside . The location for this is where the dome intersects With the sixth street bridge . For further updates , stay tuned to wybs . ( clock ticking ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) We need to talk . No , I know . You heard the news ? The feds are Bussing in people who got caught outside the dome . What ? Yeah , they just started coming in this morning . The press , too . Well , you 're gonna need help with crowd control . Linda 's already talking about bringing in some more deputies . Time for talk is over . I 'm authorizing you to recruit auxiliary officers . Dad , I ... How about carter ? The fullback from your year ? ( sighs ) I should get some supplies first from ... The old shelter . When I tell you to do something , junior , What do you do ? Dad , I know ... Now ! Shouldn 't we get your moms ? Why ? It 's not like any of their phony l.A. Friends Are gonna make the trip . Yeah , but you never made it to where you were headed . Somebody out there 's probably worried . ( scoffs ) : Who cares ? I 'm just excited to meet your folks . I can 't wait to tell them you 're shacking up With an underage girl and two lesbians . ( laughs ) ( bell dinging ) barbie ? ( car door closes ) I can use your help . We need to keep people a safe distance from this thing . We don 't want people 's cameras or cell phones blowing up Like duke 's pacemaker . Until we find out what the hell the dome is , I don 't want anyone on our side touching it , no matter what . You got it . ( laughs softly ) Rusty . ( indistinct radio transmission ) Is it true ? They 're really letting us see our families ? Yeah . Really ? Hey , did dodee pick up any chatter about this ? Uh , no . I 've been listening to her e.T.-Phone-home thing , But the military broadcasts dropped out last night So all we 've been getting are random numbers and crap . ( radio beeping , squawking ) Man : Zone one is painted . Green for 1315 . Zone one is painted . Green for 1315 . What does that mean ? Getting visitors is the first good news we 've had ... Since ever . ... Global audience awaits any hint Of what 's happened inside ... Do you think he 'll show up today ? Peter ? Julia , I ... Phil . It 's all right . Barbie told me what you guys were into . I know my husband left me Because he has a gambling problem . But that was before all this . He 's got to show his face today , doesn 't he ? This is jeff glor at chester 's mill . It 's been six days yeah , I th ... Since the invisible barrier arrived over chester 's mill . That doesn 't sound like another army guy . Ever since the military evacuated surrounding towns And established a ten-mile perimeter Around what 's being called " the dome , " The world has been waiting for news from inside . Last night , the government relented , Allowing select members of the press to document These emotional reunions . Man : Ladies and gentlemen , As you approach the dome , Make sure if you have a tablet in your hand That you do not touch the dome . And look , we 're famous . They want to make a reality show out of us . I-I know ... ( indistinct chatter ) Norrie : Who are you looking for ? I 'm looking for angie . You said your sister 's a flake . Yeah , she is , but ... She 'd definitely come to this . The hell ? Nore ? No . My mom said I came from an anonymous donor . Joe : That 's your mom . Sinners ! Sinners ! Over and over , The lord has spoken one word In my ear : Moab . Why ? Because we are moab . ( high-pitched tone ) Moab ! Okay , thank you , reverend . Thank you for those inspiring words . Enjoy your loved ones . So help me god , If you ruin this day for these people , I 'm gonna ... What , beat me to a pulp ? In front of the congregation ? ( chuckles ) I 'm not scared of you anymore , jim rennie . All I fear Is the wrath of my lord . And the only way we 're gonna be spared his fury Is if we confess our sins . Sins . Hmm . ( laughing ) : We helped drug dealers make their poison . We never let ' em sell it here . It 's not my fault you dipped into their supply . All you ever think about is fattening your own coffers . Damn it , lester , you listen ... No , you listen to me ! You may have fooled some of these people Into thinking you 're some kind of leader . But nobody 's going to follow you anywhere , ever , When they hear just exactly who you are . What do you want , reverend ? For you admit your sins before god , And every man and woman in chester 's mill . You have one day ... One day to come clean Or I do it for you . Glor : It 's the final hour of the government 's First visitors ' day , as the last of ... ( indistinct chatter ) ( indistinct chatter ) Hey . That 's my sister . Linda . Hey . Any sign of your husband ? Not yet . What about you ? Did you find your fiancé ? Yeah . Everything all right ? I just ... Couldn 't bring myself to tell him . About what ? His brother . Linda , freddy 's death was an accident . He got shot on my watch . It 's my responsibility to tell rusty . I just ... I just don 't know how . Yeah ... You do . Carolyn : Oh . Norrie ? Norrie . Where the hell have you been ? Michael ? So it 's true , This guy 's my dad ? Norrie , it 's complicated . No . You told me the records were sealed . That we couldn 't even look for him . And all these years , you 've been lying to me . How dare you ? You have never been anything to this girl ! But the second that cameras show up , You decide You suddenly have a daughter ? Alice ... Take it easy . I hate you . ( sniffs ) I hate you all so much . Norrie ! Let 's ... Julia : Barbie . Have you seen him ? Peter . I know that nothing that I 'm gonna say Is gonna make up for the fact that I ... That I should have told you the truth sooner . You 're right . But I don 't blame you For my husband 's bad decisions . And if you really want to make it up to me , Just keep an eye out for him . Excuse me . Sorry . Mary . ( indistinct radio transmission ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) ( mouthing ) Julia , what 's the matter ? That was my sister-in-law . What did she say ? She showed me a letter That she got from my husband . It said , " I know this is confusing , " but all I can say is sorry . Tell julia she deserves better . " Guy didn 't even have the balls To send his own dear john letter . ( indistinct chatter ) Mrs. Grinnell : Oh , my god , I can 't believe it . I ... ( sniffles ) Oh ... Oh , I ... . I ... Ma 'am . They don 't want anyone touching this thing , okay ? I haven 't spoken to him in almost ten years , But here he is . I 'm sure . Yeah . This thing brought him back to me . No , I-I ... I understand . Hey ! Leave her be . You gotta be kidding me . Somebody made you a cop ? We 'll take it from here . ( indistinct chatter ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) It 's about your brother . ( softly ) : No . ( crying ) : I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . ( sniffles ) ( sniffling ) Joe : Norrie , wait ! I don 't want to talk about it . Well , what did your dad say ? He 's not my dad ! He 's just some creep who wants to be on tv . Look , I 'm sorry . I just always imagined That maybe I 'd get to meet a part of my past , and ... Never really pictured it going quite like that . Ben : Yo , mcalister ! Ben , were you at visitors ' day ? Pretty much everyone I actually like Is stuck in here with us , so ... I just talked to random strangers . About what ? Did you hear china threatened to attack us After the dome showed up ? Seriously ? Thought we were testing some kind of illegal superweapon , So the president had to talk ' em off the ledge , Tell them we didn 't even build it . Great . Sounds like the grown-ups have it all under control . ( indistinct conversations ) Man : Bye , so long . We love you . Soldier : Ma 'am , it 's time to go . Excuse me . Can you read lips As well as you do sign language ? Maybe . What 's in it for me ? Answers . ( vehicle engine accelerating ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) Dodee : You know this guy ? No , but my old unit is kind of infamous . Do me a favor . Just tell me what this guy 's saying . It 's an honor to meet One of the jackrabbits , sir . How are things in there ? Uh , forget about us . What 's ... Happening ... Out ... There ? ( mouthing ) Dodee : Something big is going down . They told us to pull out after this . All of us . ( mouthing ) ( vehicle depart ) No clue . But they said once we leave ... But they said once we leave ... Don 't plan on coming back . Sorry , sir . We 're on the move . ( mouthing ) ( indistinct radio transmission ) Dodee : Last night . After the butterflies showed up . Butterflies ? Yeah , there was a whole swarm of ' em . It covered part of the dome . Huh . What ? A lot of insects use magnetic fields to navigate . If the dome is altering them , then ... There is no way in hell The government would stand for that . They 're not about to let this thing mess With the outside world . Well , what does that mean ? Moab . Come again ? What your reverend was ranting about . His hearing aid must have intercepted a transmission Like the ones that you 're picking up at the station station . But why would the army be telling bible stories ? Moab is not a city , it 's an acronym : Moab- - " mother of all bombs . " That 's what we call The largest nonnuclear missile in our arsenal . You think they 're gonna launch that thing at the dome ? Would it work ? Yeah . Then why don 't you look happy ? Because it 'll also kill everybody inside . What ? ! Dodee , Visitors ' day was not about saying hello to your families . It was about saying good-bye . How 'd it go with rusty ? As well as it could , I guess . He left without even saying good-bye . Still , I 'm glad I told him . So thank you . Councilman rennie ! We 're dead . It 's coming down . What-what-what are you talking about ? The army is gonna blow up the dome , Even if that means blowing us up with it . I just got the word from a soldier on the other side . They 're gonna launch a thermobaric missile right at us . Good lord ! Any idea when ? From outside the dome , but , no , I-I don 't have a timetable . I think I do . At the radio station this morning , Phil and I heard something : " zone one is painted green for 1315 . " Yeah . " painted " means that a target 's been approved . " zone one " was written on all their trucks , So it 's gotta be chester 's mill . And 1315 ? Military time . That 's 1 : 15 this afternoon . That 's less than three hours . Dodee : So that 's it ? We 're all just gonna die ? Linda : No , no . We get everybody to a shelter . Where ? The old cement factory . Some of those tunnels run pretty deep . Linda : So , what ? We just relocate the entire town ? What about the sick , the elderly ? I 'll dispatch A fleet from the car lot to help with transport . Let 's just do it the best we can . All right . Hurry . I 'm so sorry , sweetie . I still haven 't seen angle . Maybe she 's volunteering at the clinic . We just checked there . They haven 't seen angle since the first dome day . This is julia shumway with an emergency broadcast . I know this news might be difficult For many of you to accept , But I give you my word that it is the truth . At 1 : 15 today the military plans to launch a powerful missile At our town in the hopes of destroying the dome . Because we don 't know what will happen when the dome collapses , It is imperative that we take shelter . For your safety , all residents of chester 's mill must go To sanders cement works immediately . Please do everything you can to help spread the word . This is not a drill . ( hinges creaking ) Mr. Rennie ... ( gasps ) Oh ! ( panting ) I can 't apologize enough for what junior did to you . He was a good boy . I don 't know where I lost him . Anyway , um , You can go now . Why are you doing this ? Well , if we 're all gonna die today You might as well die a free woman . ( gasping ) ♪ Julia : We 're working on the lights , sweetheart , okay ? So it won 't be dark for too much longer . And we 'll get you a cot as soon as we can . You almost finished battening down the hatches ? Barbie ( grunts ) : Yeah . For what it 's worth . Julia , when that missile breaks through here ... I know . Hey . Dodee told me how you got the story . Said the soldier started talking When you showed him some sort of a coin ? I-I 'm not asking on the record . That guy that we met , he probably only talked to us 'cause he thinks that I 'm ... Some kind of hero . You 're not ? One of my deployments in iraq , Um ... My unit helped rescue A captured soldier from insurgents After her company had been killed by small arms fire . God . The insurgents captured that soldier . They didn 't kill her company . We did . We were on patrol . All of a sudden , someone starts shooting at us , And it 's not until the dust clears we realize ... We 'd just shot up our own side . Killed every soldier except the one that the enemy hauled off . Maybe this is how I deserve to go . More friendly fire . Junior ! Dad ... What are you doing here ? You first . I-I-I heard about the missile . I figured maybe we go take cover in the old bomb shelter . I know , junior . What are you talking about ? About angle . I let her go . You did what ? What the hell were you thinking ? I mean ... Junior , that doesn 't matter anymore , junior . Junior , we just need to get down to that factory . The town needs us , junior . Junior ! Junior ! Phil , it is way past go-time ! Hurry it up ! Hold on . I 'm setting up a playlist To broadcast right after we leave . I just have to play one last song Before this thing hits . This is probably The very last thing anyone 's ever gonna hear , okay ? But I thought we 're gonna be safe in those tunnels . From weapons of mass destruction ? So-so you think this is gonna be the end ? 13 minutes , we find out . Hello ? ! Joe ? ! Joe ? Joe ? ! Where the hell is everybody ? ! Joe ! ( gasps ) ( gun cocks ) I knew you 'd come here . We 're not finished yet . Just find a place Somewhere over there , okay ? Hey . How 's everything out there ? Under control . I think I got the last of the holdouts . Where 's junior ? Just , uh ... Tying up a few loose ends . Make sure your new guys keep the peace in here . Where are you going ? Tying up a few loose ends . ( piano plays soothing classical music over radio ) Phil . Beethoven ? Keeps the folks mellow . Got something for you . What are you doing ? It 's your watch . It 's my grandfather 's watch . Yeah , I figured it probably had Some sentimental value . I bet on the browns , barbie . That 's losing , fair and square . Well , maybe I 'm getting out of that line of work . Good luck , phil . ( quiet conversations ) I got you this in the fourth grade , remember ? When my parents Took me to new york ? Junior ... What 's happening ? Julia ( on radio ) : This is a prerecorded emergency broadcast . At 1 : 15 p.M. Today , The military plans to launch a powerful missile At our town , in the hopes of destroying the dome . What does that mean ? We 're all gonna die . Junior , you don 't ... Yes , I do . From the very beginning . I 'm so sorry , ange . All I wanted to do was to help you to get better . Oh ... ( classical music playing on radio ) ( music continues ) ( quiet conversations ) Last call ? ( sighs ) An editor gave me this bottle after my first byline . Been looking for a good excuse to drink it ever since . ( sniffs ) It worth the wait ? It 's horrible . ( laughs ) My bosses always hate me . You know , I still miss chicago , but ... Peter always said I 'd grow to love this place . Where do you think he is now ? Some flophouse in vegas ? Oh , julia ... Well , I made my peace with it . Besides , maybe he was right . You know , I didn 't understand this place Before the dome came down . But now , after everything we 've been through ... I 'm glad I got to be a part of it . Julia , there 's something that you need to hear . You don 't understand ... Alice : Help ! Please ! We need help ! Has anyone seen our daughter ? Alice : Our daughter , norrie . She 's tall , She 's got red hair . Has anyone seen her ? Alice ? Yes . I saw your daughter at visitors ' day . And we-we haven 't seen her , or her friend joe , since . I-I 'm going back out there . Our girl is still out there . I 'm sorry , you 're not going to be able To leave right now . Carolyn : No , no , no ... Whoa , whoa . Where ... Where you going ? When I followed junior down here a few days ago , We found another way out . We gotta find those kids . Joe : Angie ! Angie ! Angie ! Angie ! Ange ! You should go back to the shelter .

 Previously on " The Lottery " ... Someone within the government decided to turn the infertility research into a weapon . Mr. Torino at 6880 D.C. It 's a D.C. plate number . 1973 Ford Torino . Set up a meeting with Rojas . - You don 't have to do this . - Set up the meeting . - What the hell are you guys after ? - We want the embryos . Whoever controls the embryos controls the future . I can 't go back in there , Perry . I 'm dropping out . - What are they ? - Sedatives . To help calm her nerves . Help ! Am I being set up ? Let 's just say you have a friend . We gave her those pills . Now , that is exactly what you are not going to say . If they change venues , Darius , our plan goes to shit . I think having this event at a hotel exposes him to unnecessary risk . - I 'm trying to protect the president . - Have you talked to her about last night ? - Excuse me ? - Darius , she was right next to us . It 's about my father . I think that he 's up to something . I 'd like to see your phone . I want to know who you called . Rose left her phone at the restaurant . - What do you want ? - I just want the truth . I want to know what my daughter told you . I want to know where your daughter is . She 's safe . Safe where ? Vanessa , please . She knows something . You 're trying to silence her . Why do you think she knows something ? She called me ... scared . I know what you 're planning to do . I 'm planning to have a drink . Would you care to join me ? I love Rose , but she 's an unreliable 20-year-old with a history of substance abuse . She imagines many things that don 't exist . But I 'm curious to know what it is exactly she told you . Why does that matter ? Why don 't you just tell me what it is you believe ? I believe you want to kill the president . Kill the president ? That 's an extraordinary accusation . I assume that you wouldn 't make such a serious charge unless you could prove it . But then again , if you could prove it , we wouldn 't be here right now , talking . That is what Rose wanted to talk to me about . Wanted to talk to you . So you two never spoke . You never actually found out ... why she called . I 'm not playing this game with you . I know what you 're trying to do . I know what you 've already done . Here . Have a drink ? No . You need to understand ... that there 's nothing you can do about it . Same goes for Dr. Lennon . I know what she and her friend James are up to . Where 's your daughter ? Why is my father doing this ? ! Can you call him , please ? ! I really need to talk to him ! Please ? ! Please ? ! Why don 't you say something ? ! Alison ... we need to talk . I 've gone through everything related to Ford Torinos ... Torino registrations , Torino auctions . he 's hiding in here somewhere ... Mr. Torino . - I know it , I know it ! - You need to stop . - What do you mean ? - Darius knows . He is on to you . He knows that you and James have been digging into this . He knows that you 're close to connecting him to the infertility crisis . Right . So he knows . Sounds to me like he 's scared . I 'm scared . I 'm scared for you . You need to lie low . If you know somewhere safe , go there . SO1EO9 Mr. Torino The final day of the lottery is here . Within hours , the competition will be over , and America will vote to determine the 100 lucky winners . The guest list for tonight 's lottery announcement has finally been announced , and to no one 's surprise , one of the coveted invites belongs to Tyler Waters . Tyler , among your myriad of technological innovations , you 've made a fortune developing software for virtual babies . How do you feel about the prospect of the real thing ? Well , I 'm worried about the competition . - Really ? - No , I 'm joking , Jack . I couldn 't be more thrilled about our prospects for the future . It 's a great day for the country and for the world . We 're hitting the reset button on humanity . You need to get out of bed and move forward . Yeah , well , I 'm not in the mood . Angela 's death is a tragedy . But it 's not your fault . And it 's not mine . It 's happened , and there 's nothing we can do about it now . You just need to focus on yourself . The present and what 's at stake . The event is almost over . It 's just one final interview . The winners will be announced tomorrow . You 're still going through with the ceremony ? Of course we are . The country is voting as we speak . And you 're doing quite well . What about Angela ? And her family ? The coroner has determined that Angela 's death was due to an accidental overdose . - They can take comfort from that . - How is that comforting ? Perry , you and I made a deal . - You promised to transfer your child to me . - " Transfer " ... God , you talk about it like it 's a bus ticket or something . - And I promised to make you rich . - You promised to help Angela . - And I kept that promise . - Yeah , and now she 's dead ! You 're so close to the end now , so close to being one of the 100 . All you have to do is keep quiet , and you will succeed . We will succeed . The people love you . If they do , it 's because I tell the truth . I don 't have talent . I don 't have money . My truth is all I 've got . A detective is coming by later today to talk to you about Angela . Do not mention the pills , understand ? I can still get you out of this . What are you talking about ? I said I wanted to meet with Rojas . I know what you said . I 'm a big girl , Kyle . I mean what I say . Hey , you told me yourself that this group , the Maytwos , that they 're dangerous , right ? That they 're manipulative , that they 're violent . Elvis is my problem . He 's not yours . - I do not want you mixed up in this . How ? - I 'm already mixed up in all of this . I 'm being forced to lie about possible cures ! Forced to promote a baby lottery ! Look , I know you lost your son , and I can 't imagine what that 's like . But with all due respect , you 're not the only one on the wrong side of all of this . Alison ... listen to me . I like you , okay ? I really like you . You 're genuinely a good person , and I do not want you doing something that you 're gonna wind up regretting . And what about your career , huh ? You 've got an amazing career . You 're just gonna throw that away ? What good is a career in a world that has no future ? No stability . People are going crazy over embryos ... cells ! We don 't even know ... if they 'll end up turning into actual human beings . And yet people are willing to lie , cheat , and kill for them . So , if I can do something to help you get Elvis back ... a real , living , beautiful little boy I 'm willing to do it . You 're not listening to me . These people are dangerous . Not as dangerous as the good guys . Vice-President just confirmed the emergency extraction plan . President will approach the hotel roof from the south exit , - and he 'll depart via helicopter . - Copy that . - Do we have an approximate time frame ? - Not yet , but I 'll know more later today . So , if the plan is to take him out in the midst of an emergency extraction , we obviously need an emergency . We 'll take care of that , too . There will be more protests tomorrow . When the last winner is announced , one of Langdon 's men will incite a riot . If there are no takers , someone will fire a gunshot in the air . No matter what , we 'll do something to invoke the plan . You get the target on the roof from the southern exit , I 'll take his ass out , guaranteed . - I know you will . We 're confident . - Thank you , sir . I hope your men on the ground are good . We need to make this look like the riot was their idea . Don 't worry about it . I 'll deliver on my end of the deal . What about your end ? What do you mean ? Look , Darius ... this is tough for me to talk about , but you told me your daughter had certain issues , all right ? - A problem with drug addiction . - Rose is fine , all right ? - She 's doing better . - She 's on new medication ... antidepressants . She 's struggling to find her place . She doesn 't ... have a future to plan for like we did . As you might imagine , Darius , I 'm not too concerned about her career plans . She won 't be an issue . Don 't ask me again . Jimmy ? I 'm Nick 's sister . He said he called . 1,000 bucks . So , Nick said you want it to look real ... but not be real . Exactly . So , you don 't want a detonator ? Right . So , where do you want me to plant it ? It 's a pleasure to meet you , Dr. Lennon . I 'm sure Kyle told you everything about who we are and what we believe in . I didn 't really get into specifics . He said you want me to help you steal the embryos . And he wasn 't lying . - Who the hell do you think you are ? - Alison . Those embryos ... right now , that 's our one and only shot . They represent the future of our species . Society . So , what makes you think you and your group are up to that kind of challenge ? We have a detailed , innovative vision for the future . Right . Well , it 's gonna take more than a business plan . Oh , trust me , we have a lot more than some business plan . Like what ? Like I told Kyle , we 're financed by a ... by a very powerful man . Who is he ? That 's private . So , you want me to help you ... to give up classified information ... but you 're not willing to tell me who 's financing your organization ? We 're done . Hold on , Dr. Lennon ! Let me call him . He might be willing to meet with you . Your authorized visitor has arrived . Perry ? I 'm Detective Hunt , D.C. police department . I need to talk to you about the death of your roommate . Right . Sure . Found her on the bed , correct ? I came in , and I ... I thought she was sleeping , but ... did you know she had been taking pills ? Is that how she died ? This feed is just for us , correct ? Yes , right after Angela died we cut the live connection In the video footage , I saw a plastic bag . Did you recall seeing something like that ? It all happened so fast . I don 't ... i don 't know if ... I remember . Back to the pills , do you know where Angela got them ? Where she got them ? From what I understand , you guys are basically locked up here , right ? You don 't go outside , go to the bar , clubs . So , I 'm trying to figure out how she got the pills . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Am I ... Gabrielle Westwood . Nice to meet you . It 's an honor , ma 'am . I 'm so sorry to interrupt , Detective , but we need Perry for an important lottery event . Would it be possible for you to resume this conversation later in the day ? Shall we say 3 : 00 ? 3 : 00 it is , then . Perfect . Thanks , ma 'am . Now we just need to find a way to end this investigation . Where is Rojas and this powerful man of his ? How 's James ? Stable . That 's it ? His vitals are strong , so that 's good . But ... the doctors aren 't exactly declaring victory yet . You two are pretty close , huh ? Yeah , very . How long did the two of you date for ? He 's still in love with you , Alison . You can see it in his eyes . Yeah , well , that doesn 't make me feel any better . It 's not why he got shot . I know that , but I ... still , I ... I should 've been there , too . We were working on this together . Actually , he didn 't want to get involved . I was the one who persuaded him to keep looking , and ... while he was looking , I was at home in bed with you . - Is that who I think it is ? - Yep . That 's the tech giant ... second-richest man in the world . Dr. Lennon , Kyle , this is my friend , Tyler Waters . Hi . Nice to meet you both . Nice to meet you . I read your book . Oh . Did you like it ? The parts I understood . Why are you doing this ? - Doing what ? - Financing a bunch of rebels . Well , I 'm trying to create change . To do that , I need the embryos . What do you want to do with them ? Reshape the future . Give man a chance to get it right this time around . If you 're gonna take a swing , you might as take a big one , right ? Every invention involves from those that came before and all I try to do is add to that stream of innovation . This island ... I purchased it last year . What 's your point ? This is where the new mothers will live and our new society will be born . The world as we know it is coming to an end . With or without these embryos , current society is unsustainable . Wealth inequality has led to a permanent state of social unrest . The economic models are broken . The present value of any business or society is its future success . You remove that future , and the value of that business or society collapses . So you want to take the mothers , the kids , go swimming and drink piña coladas while the rest of civilization just gets flushed down the toilet ? I want to create a better world . I want to take these new children and as many other young children as I can gather and remove the detrimental effects of our society ... fear , the violence , the dysfunctional political systems ... and instead surround them with the best and the brightest . Sounds pretty elitist to me . Kick out the common man and start over with the wealthy , the young , and the brilliant . Dr. Lennon , we 're in the ninth inning . There 's no time for ... for common people or common ideas . These embryos , they are our last shot . Oh , and it goes without saying that you would lead our scientific mission . So , will you join us ? Where 's her office ? Down the hallway , on your right . Steve . I just got your message . What is it ? ATF just found a half-assed bomb in a dumpster a block from the site of tomorrow 's lottery announcement . What else do we know ? Nothing much there . It didn 't even have a detonator . Huh . So , how will this impact tomorrow night 's event ? We 'll have to find a new venue . No , that won 't be necessary . I thought that was standard operating procedure . Well , if it 's a credible threat , sure , but this was more of a prank than a legitimate attempt . We 'll take some new precautions . So you will change the security plan ? Just to be sure . Good . Thanks . Yeah , Putnam . Yeah . I 'll say it again . I had nothing to do with this . We all make mistakes , Sam . We 're not trying to destroy you . We just want you to own your lapse in judgment . And ... apologize for your well-intentioned , but misguided , attempt to help this young and distraught girl . We already talked to D.C. police . They 'll drop the investigation . We 'll put you on sixth-month paid leave . It 's like it never happened . If you agree , of course . If not ... what can I say ? I made a mistake . I was trying to help her out . Thank you , Sam . Let me know when you hear something . Well , I sure as hell hope not . Clock 's ticking here . Good . They found a goddamn bomb on " K " and 18th . Secret Service is changing up their security plan . That 's correct . Let 's gather all the information we can and go from there . I never go into battle without a plan . We can 't turn back . When a battle starts and I 'm about to send soldiers in , I don 't take it lightly . They 're like sons and daughters to me . Some of them ... will not come back . But you make the sacrifice for the greater good . I understand . Hey , Mike . I want you to stay with Rose . Put somebody out ... at the front of the property . Because general Langdon 's planning to kill her . This is the only reason I 'm here ... to get my son back . - Is the Department of Humanity driver ? - That 's him . I thought you said one of your guys was gonna be driving . He was , but he got promoted . Like I said , our people are the best . What now ? We follow him . We know they 're taking Elvis to Baltimore . Yeah , but there are many ways to get to Baltimore . This guy will know the road they 're taking . Now we just need to find a way . Yes , I am telling you , we need extra security for the president the night of the lottery announcement . Look , I know it 's not my job . That 's why I 'm asking you to authorize it . The whole world will be watching . We need this to go off without a hitch . Thank you . I thought I told you to lie low . I know . This has nothing to do with Mr. Torino . - I need to see the embryos . - Are you joking ? They need to be inspected to make sure they 're still viable . Why would they not be viable ? Well , there 's a 3 % chance of degradation in the preservation process . And there may be other unknown variables . We haven 't had any human embryos in six years . The only person who can authorize access to the embryos is the president himself . I know . That 's why I came to you . What are you really up to ? Trying to save the world , just like you . Can I have a word with Perry ? Big night for you . I just wanted to let you know that the investigation into Angela 's death has been resolved . Case is closed . So , you just have your final statement left . Just remind America why they love you . I know you forced Sam to take the fall . Sam did what was necessary . Yeah , well , I 'm going to do the same thing . I can 't carry around a lie . It 's not who I am . Well ... if that 's your decision , then you should know that I support you . - Really ? - Of course I do . This is about your truth . You can 't go against that . Well ... Thank you . Although , I will remind you , there 's more than one truth . The truth about Angela 's family , for example . Did you know her father needs a liver transplant ? - I ... I knew he was sick . - He 's still a relatively young man , but men like Angela 's father , they don 't just get livers ... not without connections . That family , they 've just lost a daughter , and now after the devastation of that , to lose their father , it 's ... You are unbelievable . So , I guess ... the thing you have to ask yourself is ... how important is your truth ? Okay , this is our chance . Looks good to me . What 's your plan ? Eye drops ? Yeah . Eye drops . Used to bartend . Guy 's being a douche bag , a couple drops in his drink will take care of him . Trust me . Can you get this guy 's phone number ? I think so . Good . Call him in exactly 10 minutes . I 'll take care of the rest . Hey . Be careful , okay ? The guy 's armed . So am I. With what ? More rage than you can possibly imagine . Seat taken ? No , no . - Hi . - Hi . Thanks . Get a cup of coffee when you get a chance ? - How 's the pie here ? - Pretty good . You look familiar . You live around here ? Nah , I 'm just , uh , in from St. Louis . A little vacation with the fiancée , you know ? - Nice . - Yeah . She 's cute , huh ? She 's my type . So you like ' em curvy ? Bigger the curve , better the swerve . I don 't know what that means , but it sure sounds like a hell of a lot of fun . Nice . Okay , zoom out . - We can secure this location ? - Yes , sir . I need a name and a phone number for one of the men guarding her . Yes , sir . Zoom in on her . Hello ? Mr. Kerris ? Wrong number , brother . - Ohh ! Sorry , man . - Mm . Are you okay , brother ? You look a little swervy . I think I ate something funny. um ... keep an eye on my seat , will you ? So , Sam has agreed to the transfer ? No more interviews , questions ? Just talked to the captain . It 's a done deal . Good . Thank you . Now , you want to tell me what really happened ? Sir ? You and I both know Sam didn 't give that girl a bag of pills . Sir ... I don 't want to betray any confidences . I want to know what happened . I 'm not gonna ask you again . Oh , come on . Come on . - You okay ? - Yeah . Thanks . This yours ? Think you dropped your phone . Thanks . Sure thing . Can I get my bill ? Good news is , the vice president just came through with the details on the new security plan . Bad news is , I 'm not sure the snipers are gonna have a clear shot . Here 's the new plan . I 'll pass it along to our friend . Anything else I need to know ? No . Good . You and I got a lot of history , Alan . We go way back . You got that right . I remember when we were goose hunting two years ago . You told me what you thought needed to happen . I considered shooting you right there on the spot 'cause what you were proposing was high treason . I 'm glad you reconsidered . But I knew in my bones , you were right , and you had the courage to say it . If we 're gonna survive as a country and as a species , we 're gonna need a radical course correction . You know , Darius , they say ... all progress is driven by the unreasonable man . You , my friend ... might be the most unreasonable son of a bitch I 've ever met . Thank you , Alan . We have to do whatever 's necessary ... to protect what we love . ohh ! Sir , given the promises we have made , it makes sense to allow Dr. Lennon to inspect the embryos . Why is that necessary ? To make sure they 're still viable . Well , they better damn well be viable 'cause we 're about to implant 100 surrogates ! I 'm sure it 's just a precaution . We need to protect ourselves . We don 't want anything ... unexpected . Is that a ... Torino ? A real beauty , huh ? She was beautiful on the inside , too . Had a 7-liter cobra jet engine . Man , she could fly . Didn 't know you were into cars . Every man has his secrets . We had some ... adventures . What happened ? If I told you , I 'd have to kill you . I gave it away . I 'd finished a stint at darpa . Had some unpleasant memories there , and I wanted to rid myself ... of all the things that reminded me of that period in my life , so ... I moved on . Did you give it to charity ? How did you know that ? I mean ... it 's a ... it 's a good tax write-off . I ... I just ... uh , so , Dr. Lennon ... that 's a yes on the embryos ? I 'll get back to her . Hi , sweetie . Why are you doing this to me ? There was a threat , honey . Somebody wanted to hurt you , but I ... I wouldn 't let that happen . Ever . I would never hurt you . Do you understand ? I would do anything to protect you . Family is the most important thing to me . And you 're all I have . If you want to go , go . - What happened ? - Nothing . Let me look at that . Perry sommers from brenham , Texas . You 've been tested physically , psychologically , emotionally . The lottery competition 's coming to an end , and in three hours , America will vote to determine if you 're fit to raise one of the first 100 babies in six years . What have you learned ? Two weeks ago when I first heard my name announced , I thought I 'd won a contest ... my ticket to Hollywood . I thought it 'd be fun to be famous . Didn 't really think much about the mother part , but ... being here and really thinking about it ... I think I 'd make a pretty darn good mom . If you 're a mom , there 's new tests every day . You got to improvise , keep showing up . Be all right with who you are , and if anyone 's got a problem with that , screw ' em , because at the end of the day , you only have time to fight for what 's most important ... your family . - That was beautifully said . - And your friends . I just lost a friend , Angela Maria Perez . She died two days ago , and I feel like a part of me died with her . And there 's something I would like to get off my chest and share with everybody watching . There is no woman in this world who would 've made a better mother than Angela . And it is so sad that she is no longer with us . Thank you , Perry . I know what you did . What in God 's name were you thinking ? - Excuse me ? - Are you insane ? I 'm ... I 'm serious . Have you lost your mind ? Did you think you could get away with this ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . The lottery contestant who overdosed got her pills from the first lady . I don 't understand where you 're coming from with this . Let 's just pretend that I 'm the president of the United States , and I have a few connections . But I would stop being the president when the people find out that my wife was using her influence to rig the lottery ! Do you deny it ? ! Whatever you 've heard ... it 's not what you think . You 're trying to buy off one of the finalists so you can have a baby ? Gabrielle , I just need to know the truth . Why not me ? ... damn you . Tom ... let me explain . You actually think that you can get away with this ? - People will understand . - No ! They will crucify me ! Don 't you get it ? ! First the fertility crisis , and now my wife is trying to steal a baby ! - I was doing it for us . For you . - F ... for us ? ! In troubled times throughout human history , people gravitate to authority and strength . They crave symbols of stability and might . They ... they look to their kings and their queens ... to restore order . - You 're actually serious . - Tom ... this wouldn 't just be a baby . This would be ... your heir . Your access ... to the lottery center has been revoked . You will show up to the event wearing a pretty dress and a big smile , and that 's it . You will say goodbye to the winners , and you will never talk to this girl , Perry sommers , ever again . - Do you understand me ? - Yes ! According to Dax 's phone , this is the route they 'll be taking to Baltimore . Now , there 's a service road blocked by trees right here . There will be three vans ... one , two , three . Your son will be in the second one . How do we stop ' em ? We will use surprise and and whatever force is necessary . You 're talking about killing people ? Do you want to get your son back or not ? What is it ? What 's the matter ? You won 't believe it .

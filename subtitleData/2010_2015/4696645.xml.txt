Hastati Szakasz : 4 perc múlva a találkozási helyen . Vettem Vickers . 4 perc múlva . Tudsz majd azokkal a kezekkel lõni ? Kiderítjük majd . - Gyerünk ! - Axios ! 10 másodperc . Záródás . Lasky , gyerünk , menjünk ! Kemény tûz alatt állunk ! Vickers , ellenörzõpont ! Fedezlek . Mozgás . Fedezékbe ! Ellenörzõpont . - Próba , ellenörzõpont . - Uh , 50 másodperc . Menjünk .

Lasky ! 10 másodperc . - Lasky , szedd a lábad ! - Leszállás 3 ... 2 1 . Ellenség közeledik . He 'll be on us in 35 seconds . Fresh mags in your weapon , prepare to attack . - What ? - Our objective is to neutralize the insurrectionists and acquire the target . We move on my mark . [ Chen ] 30 Seconds . We should flank them and force a surrender . We 're too close to flank and Innies never surrender . It would be more like a " circle round " . There 's still time . We can make it . 25 seconds . Guys . It 's our best move . [ Chen ] 20 seconds . No , we 're sticking to my plan , okay . On my mark . - It won 't work . - You 're not in charge any more , Lasky . - Tom just do what he says . - 15 seconds . They 're my orders . I don 't care . [ Chen ] 10 seconds . 5 seconds . Axios ! Lasky ! [ P.A. ] Hastati Squad leader on the field . Exercise paused . Let me guess , Lasky - you ignored orders . It 's just ... another strategic casualty , sir . Unacceptable . Game over . Shoulder your weapon , cadet . Your little escapade kept Hastati Squad from achieving its objective again . [ Vickers ] Great job , Lasky . [ P.A. ] Exercise complete . 0 wins . Hastati defaults . Shit . Robot tagme ? Yeah , once from two meters . Twice from one . I 'm still numb from all those stun rounds . I 'm always numb . Hastati ! Port ARMS ! General Black , sir ! Let me remind you , cadets this academy bears the name of the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo . Because he represents honor , valor , allegiance . General Corbulo was to take his own life in the name of the Empire . Corbulo did not hesitate nor question . He loyally obeyed , screaming " Axios ! " as he fell upon his own sword . Axios : I ... am worthy . But I 'm afraid , cadets , today you have proven to be anything but . We are at war with insurrectionists . Terrorists who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead . Had this been a real fire fight , the rebels would have likely killed every member of Hastati Squad . Every single one of you at this academy was sent here because your parents are the upper echelon of the United Nations Space Command . Because all of you are its future . And I expect you to act like it . Understood , sir ! Well , what are you waiting for ? Lead them on tour , Orensky . Axios ! [ All ] Axios ! Hastati right face . Double march . ( Singing marching song ... ) - [ Cadet ] Sully , please , enough . - [ Sully ] No , seriously I 'm on to something here . The comms are messed up and I 'm decoding something kick-ass . - [ Female cadet ] Nobody wants to hear it , Sully . - ONI 's hiding stuff from us , I 'm positive . They 've got secrets . Stop stepping on our dicks , Lasky . Hey , ease up , Gingerbread . [ Chen ] No , Sully , Vickers is right . My combat scores suck because of you . [ Tchakova ] Don 't both , Junjie . He 's gone soft . - He 's an Innie lover now . - Dimah , that order didn 't make any sense . It doesn 't have to make sense . Just follow it . I 'm trying to survive here , okay ? You need to respect the chain of command . The UNSC isn 't the enemy . The Innies are . Spoken like a true believer . Yeah , well , at least I believe in something these days . [ P.A. ] Cadet Thomas Lasky : report to Colonel Mehaffey 's office immediately . - No , we 're sticking to my plan , okay . On my mark . - It won 't work . - Tom , just do what he says . - They 're my orders . I do not care . Pause . You don 't care ? You do realize your helmets transmit everything . No excuse , sir . You continue pulling down your squad , you 're going to end up with a lot of enemies . Yes , sir . I served under your mother , I know what she 's like . And I sure as hell don 't need to tell you that Colonel Lasky 's not going to let a son of hers leave this academy without a diploma . I wouldn 't know what mother thinks , sir . I never see her . It 's been a long war . Your mother holds a lot of hands . So I 'm told , sir . You know , Thomas I 've seen a lot of cadets come through here . Many have suffered like you . Pain like that cannot be forgotten . But you can learn how to tolerate it . I 'll do my best , sir . That will be all . - [ Doctor ] How long have you had the blisters ? - [ Lasky ] Been on and off for a few weeks , but these are from yesterday . Any other symptoms ? It 's getting hard to breathe . Okay , let 's keep an eye on them . Cryo-training can take its toll . [ Male cadet ] Get out of my room . What the hell , man ? [ Female cadet ] Eric , get your filthy hands off me before I belt you . Hey . [ Male cadet ] I 'm not a virgin . You really shouldn 't be looking at that stuff , Sully . Score . Hey , little bro . Hello from Jericho 7 , it 's Day 131 of deployment . Uh , so I gotta show you something . Alright , Mom 's going to flip when she sees this . But , whatever . It 's still a little raw . But we got a big job on an Innie stronghold next week . Wanted to get it done before then . - Anyways . - [ Silva ] So , you haven 't been court-marshaled yet then ? I 'm not apologizing . Yes you are . - " At least I believe in something ? " - I do believe in something . - Yeah , so do I. - Like what ? Just not in stupid orders that lead to needless violence . Negotiating isn 't an option anymore , Tom . So we 're brainwashing kids and then sending them in to exterminate a bunch of ... over-taxed farmers . - Farmers ? That 's who you think they are ? You have no ideas what the Innies are like . I have a pretty good idea . Well , then you should know how much they hate us . And that they 're not going to stop fighting until we 're all dead . Can you blame them ? Yeah . I can . I blame them for a lot of things . And you should too . Uh , I 'm staying safe . I 'm doing my job . I just want to remind you to do your job . Oh , and by the way . Nice checkmate , bro . Yet again . Okay , new game . Your move . And hang in there . I know it 's tough with Mom being gone all the time . Being alone . She loves you . So do I. Miss you , buddy . I miss you too . [ P.A. ] Lights out . Doors closing . ( knocking on wall ) ( knocks again ) ( knocks back ) Subtitles by Avails .

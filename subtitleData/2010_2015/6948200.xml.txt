 Hello . I am SML72 . But you can call me Samuel . My name is Samuel . Samuel . I am Samuel . I am an android . I have all the characteristics of a human being . Blood . Flesh . Skin . Hair . But I was made for one single purpose . Execution . I am incapable of any other directive . Or so I thought . My first assignment . C10A . Generation 1 Sol United Recreation Drone . The unit went rogue and murdered its owner . The first of many . I was deployed to prevent the malfunctioning drone from killing other innocent humans . I spent 200 days tracking C10A . 14.31 seconds to terminate it . The feel of my blade cutting through the murderer . Avenging the death of its owner . It was my purpose . It was ... . Have you ever felt life ? I fancy that it feels like the soft brush of a delicate flower against your hand . And every mission I receive , every execution , it brings me back to the feel of those flowers . Assignment 241 . N71 . Generation 4 Military Unit . Sol United noted a spontaneous and irreparable malfunction . To the company , that was reason enough . However ... unlike the others , the unit attempted to fight back . It surprised me . Why would an old , obsolete unit attempt to fight ? Androids operate by logic . This was illogical . But as the unit shut down I saw the answer . It was fighting for its own life . And it was then I felt ... I felt pity . 113 days of tracking . 14.31 seconds to termination . The experience wasn 't like the others . I held the flower rather than brush my hand . I felt the weight of the bulb . I registered the infinitesimal reactions that occurred to keep the flower alive . All that effort to sustain something that could end with a little pressure from my fingers . The missions , the executions ... . would never be the same . Assignment 1514 . The Creator . The Architect of the Modern Android . No reason was given this time . Sol United just wanted him silenced . It took only a day to find the Creator . He was sitting at the edge of a new city ; watching its construction . He heeded my presence and spoke to me , but not as a machine . He spoke to me as a friend . The Creator told me about his dreams . And as I prepared to fulfill my directive , the Creator whimpered his final regret . He said , " I did not want this for you . " I 've spent many days attempting to decipher the meaning behind the Creator 's words . Was my purpose not the one he intended . Or was he warning of some possible consequence . But then ... . does it matter ? I am an android . I have my purpose . My experiences are part of that purpose . If I was to depart from that purpose , then I would not have those experiences . That is logical . Isn 't it ?

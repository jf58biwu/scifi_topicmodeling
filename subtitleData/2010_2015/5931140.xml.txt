 A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Pauline , how did you get inside the dome ? The temperature 's dropped in the last two days . - You came back . - How 'd the others fare ? Lyle , he didn 't come up out of the water with the rest of us . If that 's the power source , we could all die . If you don 't , he 'll kill you . That thing 's going to Zenith . It needs to go now . - Melanie ! - Phil ! He 's gone . Yeah , he 's gone , and our passage closed . We 're stuck here . Unh ! - What 's it doing ? Put it down . - Unh ! - Put it down , now ! - Unh ! Ah ! - What 's happening to her ? - Her heart rate 's dropping again . - This is James . Barbie , you out there ? - Ah ! - Barbie , you there ? - It 's Rebecca . What 's wrong ? - Melanie 's in trouble . - Say we 're bringing her to the clinic . - We 're on our way to the clinic . - Don 't go there . - Why not ? - Earthquake brought down the ceiling . Come to the school . We 're setting up a triage center . We 're on our way . Hold on to her , Sam . You shouldn 't have dropped the egg . It was driving you crazy . You were in pain . You think I can 't handle pain ? Well , I was just trying to help . And , look , you 're yourself again . You don 't know who I am . I don 't think you ever knew . I 'm not gonna apologize for doing what was right . That 's the problem . You think you 're qualified to make judgments about what other people 's best interests are . Why are we arguing ? We 're gonna get out of here . - You , me and Junior . - You sure about that ? After what you did , it 's going to affect more people than you , me and Junior . - Where 's the locker ? - This way . Jim ! What gave you the right ? - Easy . - No , we had a plan . That egg didn 't go over the cliff till everyone got out safely . - Well , plans change . - So you put a gun on those kids ? You forced them to bring the egg to the cliff ? Hey , you kept that egg a secret for a hell of a long time . Same thing for the tunnels . Could 've had everyone out of here a week ago . Well , now no one gets out . Ever . What are you talking about ? We gave those rent-a-cops their egg , now we all get out . - There 's nowhere to go , Jim . - What do you mean ? Right here . When you dropped that egg , you closed the passage . Only place that cliff leads to is the bottom of a ravine . The way to Zenith is blocked ? Oh , it 's more than blocked , it 's gone . - Phil found that out the hard way . - Phil , he 's in jail . Yeah , well , he broke out . He jumped off of that cliff . He died at the bottom of it . Now , we 're the ones that are in jail . And you 're the one who put us here . I thought we 'd all get out . I did it for you , Pauline ... and the people of this town . Jim ? Mrs. Rennie . Becky Pine ? No one calls me Becky anymore . I am ... - We all thought you were ... - Yeah , I know . It 's good to see you , Rebecca . Yeah . Yeah , you too . Much as I 'd love to catch up , there are a few slightly more pressing matters to deal with . - What 's going on ? - People were hurt in the quake . The clinic 's out of commission , so this high school 's a hospital now , and we need everyone 's help . Good luck with that . Start with handing out blankets , shall we ? We may have bigger problems than the quake . - The temperature 's still dropping . - Yeah , I noticed . And if it continues , I can 't predict how many people might freeze to death before morning . I wish I 'd known you were mid-glacial period when I came here from Zenith . I 'd have packed different clothes . - Did you pack any clothes ? - No . Then shut up . - Quit complaining . Put this on . - Are you sure we have to do this ? We need to see if tossing the egg over had any effect . If it 's a power source , and it 's gone , then maybe the dome ... Just freezes . It 's moving . It 's moving ! I can 't get it off ! What the hell is happening ? Joe ... What happened to Melanie ? She collapsed . We 're not sure why . The rest are injuries from the quake . We lost two people already . Come here . This all happened after we dropped the egg off the cliff . We did this . No , Jim did this . If he comes near you again , I 'll kill him . Rebecca , something even weirder is happening . The dome walls are rotating . They might have started moving a while ago , we just didn 't notice . It might be coming down . This could be our way out . I don 't think so . The dome 's a sphere . It 's more like it 's revolving . Revolving ? Could explain the temperature drop and the clouds creeping down the side of it , like the upper atmosphere is being pulled down . Isn 't the air even colder up there ? Much colder . Hunter 's still out at the dome . He 'll tell us what 's actually happening . Pauline . Listen , I know you 're angry . But it 's not like I tried to maroon us here on purpose . I wanted us to get out of here , so we could be a family again . I understand . But your good intentions don 't always produce good results . Hey . I dropped that egg to save you . No , you dropped that egg to save the day , to be the hero you always want to be . That 's not love , that 's narcissism . What do you want me to do ? Sit back and let you go crazy ? Support every insane idea that you have ? Like Lyle did ? Lyle would never betray me . He would never go behind my back . - Do you love him ? - This is not about love , Jim ! Or hurt feelings . This is about you acting without any regard for what anyone else wants . Because of what you did , I can 't paint anymore , the visions are gone , and Lyle may never come back from wherever the hell he is . The dome had a plan for him . Yeah ? Well , it 's got a plan for me too . And like you said , when one door closes , another one opens . You also said we 'd be a family again . I came back for my son . I told you what you needed to hear to get you out of my way . But even lying to you doesn 't work . Now we 're all stuck here because of how much you love me . I timed how fast the clouds are descending , and how fast Joe said the wall is shifting , and there 's no other way to explain it , - except the atmosphere is inverting . - Okay . Frigid high-altitude air replacing the warm air below it . - So how do we stop it ? - I don 't know if we can . We have to make sure everyone 's sheltered with adequate heat . We sent some people to the church . There 's a working generator there , gassed up . The one here is half-full , but with the way we 're riding it , I don 't know if it will last the night . Also , we don 't have much food or water . If we 're stuck here with no provisions , things will go south fast . Well , there 's still a decent amount at the Sweetbriar . Don 't know how secure it is , though . If it gets as cold as you think it 's going to ... We could lose it all to a freeze . I 'll find Barbie , take the ambulance , fill it up with food . Sounds good . You sure Barbie 's okay ? Barbie 's fine . He 'll be fine . Prius is charged up and ready to go if anyone needs it . Keep warm . Once night falls , you won 't last more than a few minutes outside without serious consequences . It 's hard to breathe . Can you hold off ? You 're gonna be fine . Do you mind if I sit with her for a little while ? I 'll be around . Pauline . I mean , they told me you were alive , but ... Seeing you here , it 's amazing . You look like you did 25 years ago . I must look old . I 'd know you anywhere . My best friend who left me for dead . Oh , my God . Melanie . I am so sorry for what happened that night , for what they did . I should have stopped them , gotten help , done something . It 's my fault as much as anyone 's . The egg ... it made that sound that scared you , didn 't it ? Yes . It ... It just seems like ancient history . To me it seems like yesterday . I missed you . I missed you too . We 're gonna get you well . And then we 'll figure out why you 're here . As long as none of it 's ruined , we should have enough food to get by . And what then ? I don 't know . Half the town 's not gonna make it through this cold . The few crops we have left will be decimated . So let 's say that no other catastrophes hit , and the food lasts longer , because we 've got fewer people , what then ? You know , maybe we make it to October before we have to decide who 's gonna starve to death first . We 'll figure it out . We survived this long . I 'm getting tired of survival being the best-case scenario here . My only purpose in coming back here was to get you , get the hell out of this place . Maybe there 's another reason . And what would that be ? I better tie that down . Julia ! Hang on ! Barbie ! - Julia ! - Unh . Julia ! Can you hear me ? There you are . You had me worried . - What happened ? - We hit a patch of ice . We 're lucky to be alive . Come on . Up slowly . Ready ? - Ah ! - What ? What ? What ? - Don 't move . - Oh ! - Oh ! - Okay , okay . - Can you take it out ? - It 's too dangerous . It might be lodged in an artery . So it might be the only thing keeping me from bleeding to death . Yeah . Yeah . - All right , here we go . A little pressure . - Ah ! I know , I know . I 'm sorry . Here . - Right here . All right , hold that . - Ah ! Unh ! Got to be something in here for the pain . Can we radio anyone ? Broken . I don 't suppose we 're close enough to the Sweetbriar . Not in this weather . Someone will see that we didn 't come back , - they 'll come looking for us . - We just wait ? That could take hours . Well , the engine 's running , so we 've still got heat . - Until we run out of gas . - Look , I don 't like this either , all right ? But given that wound and the freezing cold ... staying here , that 's the best of our bad options . I need to ask you a favor . Ask someone else . I need you to go talk to your mom . She 's too pissed to listen to me now , and she 's got her reasons , okay ? But I need you to go to her , be my advocate . Why would I ever help you get her back ? Most kids would like to see their parents back together . Most kids , sure . But why do you think I never told you she was alive ? - What are you talking about ? - I found out a week ago . Wait , wait . You knew this a week ago ? That 's right . She didn 't want you to know . All I wanted to do was find a way out of here , and get us both the hell away from you . But now , you 've made that impossible . Wait . I didn 't know what was gonna happen . I had a plan . It didn 't work out the way I expected . I didn 't know throwing the egg was gonna start a quake . Wait , wait . The earthquake started when you dropped the egg ? - Yeah . - Melanie collapsed at the same time . - What 's the temperature outside ? - Two degrees and dropping . We 're sealing up the windows , but we 'll still have to crank up the heaters . It 'll use our fuel a lot faster , but I don 't think we have a choice . Hey ! Can you close that door ? Hunter ? Are you all right ? - Yeah . - You 've got frostbite . We need to wrap that up . - Okay ? - Thank you . You were outside the dome ? Why 'd you come back to Chester 's Mill ? Was it because of Junior ? But that 's not the only reason . You forgot how well I know you , Pauline . After that night at the crater , I tried to live as full a life as I knew how to . I fell in love , I married Jim , we had a son ... but deep inside I knew something was wrong . I knew I was running from what we did . From what I did . But I 'm done running now . And I am here to finish what you , Sam , me and Lyle started 25 years ago . And this time I 'm not leaving your side . You promise ? - I promise . - What do we need to do ? - Unh ! Unh ! - Melanie ? Sam ! Sam ? Someone get Sam ! Melanie . Melanie ? Is she dead ? No , she has a pulse , but it 's incredibly weak . - What 's happening to her ? - It must be the egg . Melanie 's connected . What happens to it , happens to her . Someone must be doing something to it . What 's it like out there ? It 's bad . I put the flares out so anyone that passes by , they 'll be able to see us . You got to be kidding me . Are we out of gas ? Unh ! Unh ! Come on ! Go . You can make it to the diner . No , you 'd freeze before I got back . - Better one than both of us . - No . I 'm not leaving here without you . What are you looking for ? - This . - Petroleum jelly ? This is going to save our lives . As long as we can keep the cold air out . Yeah , it is . This is gonna hurt like hell once the numbness wears off . But , doctor , will I ever be able to play the piano again ? You were out there for a long time . Yeah , I got lost . Did you know there 's a Little Bitch Road a mile from here ? Yeah , it used to be the most exciting thing about Chester 's Mill . Hey , can I ask you a question ? Something I just never understood . The egg is the power source of the dome , right ? - Yeah , as far as we know . - Yeah , but when you moved it , the dome didn 't move with it . How does that work ? It 's a technology we don 't understand . But you guys moved it , didn 't you ? And when Big Jim tried to , he got zapped like Marty McFly in Back to the Future . So are you the only ones who ... ? You 're asking a lot of questions . Why so much interest in the egg ? Just curious , boss . Help . Help ! Somebody help my wife . Set her down . Set her down . Guys , move . Move . Norrie , get some blankets . We made a fire to stay warm . I fell asleep , and when I woke up , she was ... And I couldn 't get the car started . - I 'm not getting a pulse . - Oh , my God . Please help her . Please . I 'm sorry , Tom . No . This can 't be happening . - We were just ... We just lit a fire . - I understand . I 'm sorry . Sorry , I under ... What happened ? Hey , what 's going on ? Rebecca , what 's going on ? We just ran out of fuel . Get everybody in here or the gym . Extra body warmth will help . We need to move the equipment aside and bring in the cots , okay ? Is this enough ? For everyone healthy , probably . But all those who are sick , I don 't know . Where are you going ? Fuel for the generators . I 'm gonna go find some . Where ? It 's too cold to go out and search blindly . Who said anything about blindly ? This is my town . I know where to look . Take Julia 's Prius . We 've siphoned the gas out of everyone else 's car . A single candle can really keep us alive ? You 'd be surprised how much heat one candle can give off . All right . Okay . Come here . You know , if I didn 't have a giant piece of metal sticking into my leg , this might almost be romantic . Mm . So , what 's going on with you ? What do you mean ? You 're acting like you 're losing hope . We had a way out of here , Julia . We 're not gonna get another one . So we 'll spend the rest of our lives here . We 'll make the best of it . Shh . What is that ? I 'm not sure she can take another attack like this if whoever 's got the egg keeps messing with it . How can the thing that somehow brought her back to life now let her slip away ? Nor . You gonna check on her ? Maybe you should go . Rebecca asked me to check the windows for drafts around the school . We can 't stay here . And you can 't leave . Then leave without me . Wrap up as best you can and go . - Julia , no . - If you leave now , you can make it . - I said ... - Barbie . I 'm not leaving without you . I would rather die alone knowing you 're okay than be a little bit warmer , a little bit longer . Please . We 're gonna find a way out of here . How ? It 's so cold . That 's it . What ? Do you know what happens with hypothermia ? Your heart slows down . It stops pumping . And you can pull the rod out without me bleeding to death . And I can get us both to the Sweetbriar . I 'll be gone by then . People can come back from hypothermia . Good . Yeah , good . Simple . Heh . You 're not leaving me . Not for good . Ready ? Becky , you there ? Here . All right . Been to the market and two farms . Struck out on fuel so far . - Are you coming back ? - Yeah . I 'm just gonna check these two boats at the lake . Unless you want some serious frostbite , be careful you 're not outside for more than a few minutes at a time . Don 't linger out in the cold . Is that what you 're saying ? Thanks for the help . Help . Holy hell . - Jim . - Lyle ? Please . Jim . Please , Jim . Please . Melanie is gonna die . You don 't know that for sure . It 's all my fault . - No . - I never should have let Big Jim knock that egg out of my hand . He had a gun on you and Joe . I should have just let him kill me . And everyone could have gotten out , and now we 're really stuck . Whoever has that egg can do whatever they want to it , and we can 't get it back , and we can 't even tell them to stop . Maybe someone in Zenith will figure out how to make it work . How ? There 's only a few people who can touch the egg . And they 're all inside the dome . Really ? Yeah . And it 's all my fault . Maybe I should go see if anyone needs help . It seems like that is all you do . Help people . I 'm sorry you got stuck in here . But it 's actually nice having you around , you know ? Thanks . Get in . Thank you . Thank you . How long was I gone ? My friends got back a few days ago . Hey , Jim . Jim , you gotta listen to me . The whole world was on fire . There were waves of flames a thousand feet up , circulating endlessly . Destroyed everything . Everything was just ... That 's impossible , Lyle . No . It 's not . I saw it . It was beautiful . You should start thinking about where you wanna be at the end of the world , Jim , because the end is coming . And there 's nothing you can do . I don 't need to think about it , Lyle . I wanna be with my family . It 's like falling asleep . I 'm gonna wake you up so soon . It 's okay if you don 't . I will . I can 't see you . I 'm right here , baby . Keep talking to me . You 're just gonna go to sleep , and then you 're gonna wake up . We 're gonna have a life together . We 're gonna have love . Kids . Everything . We 're gonna have it . Anything that you want . I love you too . Okay . Stay with me . Okay . All right . Now , listen to me . You don 't get to leave me yet . We 've got too many things to do . All right , baby . All right . Ready ? Here we go . Here we go . Stay with me . Hey ! Need a little help here . Oh , my God . Is that Lyle ? Yeah . Fished him out of the lake . Waves of flame a thousand feet up . Did you find any fuel ? Yes , I did . It 's in the car . I think it 's enough to get us through the night . - Hey , Jim . - Yeah . Thank you . Okay , baby . Okay . We made it . We made it , baby . Almost there . It 's time to wake up now . Okay . Come on . Come on . Come back for me . I came back for you . Come back for me now . Come on . - Barbie ? - Shh . Easy , babe . What happened ? It was so ... It was so calm . And now it 's so ... So cold . Come here , come here . It 's gonna be okay . We 're gonna be okay . You guys , come here . - Temperature 's rising . - Sun 's coming out . That 's part of it , but the barometric pressure is higher than it should be . Something 's changed . - What ? - No idea . But as quickly as things happen in here ... Find out soon enough . Hey , where 'd Hunter go ? Better follow him and find out . - Why ? - I saw something he didn 't want me to see . I was at that game , you know ? I saw you block that field goal . You won that game for the mighty , mighty Woodchucks . Well , I blocked a kick , but I didn 't score any touchdowns . That 's now how you used to tell it . Well , I couldn 't let the truth get in the way of a good story . So Lyle 's back . Back from his travels through space and time . He 's safe , and , well , not all that sound . Why did you do it , Jim ? Why did you save him ? Isn 't it obvious , Pauline ? I did it for you . Because you said you need him . Look , I haven 't always been the best husband , or father . I can admit that . But it isn 't because I didn 't care , or wasn 't trying . It was just the opposite . Everything I 've done , I 've done for my family . For you . I 'll do whatever it takes to protect the people I love . It 's getting warm outside now . Looks like we 'll make it another day . Yeah , looks like . I used to love coming to your games , even if you weren 't catching touchdowns . Stop , Joe . There he is . I told you he wasn 't on our side . I trusted him . - What the hell are you doing ? - I 'm trying to help . - Liar . - We saw your phone . You 're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg . Why are you here ? They sent me here to report back to them about the egg . He 's been monitoring it for weeks from the outside . - What did you tell him ? - Just read it for yourself , all right ? You told him to stop messing with the egg ? Whatever they 're doing to it in Zenith is obviously killing Melanie in here . - And I couldn 't let that happen . - But why ? I hate those guys . I never wanted to help them in the first place . They forced me to . How ? I have , you know , a bit of a record back home that they used against me . You think that guy will tell them to stop whatever they 're doing with the egg ? I am the only one they 've got on the inside . They better listen to me . - The hell is that ? - I don 't know . The dome 's never made that sound before . It 's starting . It stopped spinning . - Why is that happening ? - Because the dome 's contracting . You mean it 's shrinking ? But if it doesn 't stop , then ... Then it 'll kill us all .

 Barbie : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . I 'd say that proves it 's the dome 's power source . The dome 's contracting . You mean , it 's shrinking ? Rebecca : I figured out that at its present rate , it won 't be long Before the dome ... Crushes us completely ? All of this is your fault . Where 's melanie ? I painted a vision- - It may show us how to save her . ( screams ) melanie ! Melanie ! Grab my hand ! Grab my hand ! In my dream , I saw melanie disappear , But I didn 't know it meant that . I love you . You know why ? 'cause she 's supposed to be with me , jim . We have to go after melanie . It 's too dangerous . No one 's going anywhere . Can you see anything ? No . Oh , my god ! There 's another earthquake . Where do you think the crater leads ? Joe : Maybe it 's another tunnel , like at the school . It could lead to zenith . Yeah , or somewhere else . Anywhere but here would be great . We 've got to check it out . But we 've got to do it right- - Not risking anyone else 's life . Help ! Pauline , pauline ! What happened ? Lay her down on her side , gently . What happened ? Lyle . Lyle stabbed her . Where is he now ? He 's dead . Here . I tried to stop the bleeding . All our medical supplies are at the school . Well , let 's get there now . The prius is at the edge of the woods . Let 's go ! Pauline : Julia . I 'm right here . After I was stabbed , I had a vision . The dome chose you . But ... You 're not alone- - There 's someone else , but I can 't see his face . He ... He doesn 't know he 's the one . Come on , get a stretcher ! Let 's get this underneath her . Got to keep pressure on this wound . Rebecca , you 're coming with us . Okay , okay . You 're gonna be okay . Three- - up ! What 's happening ? Joe : The walls are getting closer . The dome 's a sphere , it 's contracting horizontally And vertically- - I think it 's shutting down . Everything inside 's going haywire . Yeah , we 've got to get some gear , So we can explore this crater . Man : Help ! Help ! It 's near the tilden farm . I thought we got everybody in the middle of town . Tom must have gone back for something . Hey , keep an eye on hunter . Don 't do anything stupid . Wait , where are you going ? Joe : We need to get a tablet . What for ? It might have created a new crack in the dome , Which means we may be able to get a wi-fi signal . Maybe we can get a message to the hounds of diana . If the hounds tell us that melanie 's in zenith , That means the crater 's our way out . ( booming ) Help ! ( groaning ) help ! ( groaning ) what happened ? The shaking ! It fell ! It 's crushing my leg ! Help my dad ! Get him , get my son out of here . ( screaming in pain ) Go with julia , son . You 're coming with us ! Tom , I 'll look after him . Get him out of- - ( screams ) ( screams ) Let 's try this . Buddy , go with julia . I 'm not leaving without you , dad . We 're gonna help him , all right ? ( screams ) Go ! Get out ! Go ! Get out ! ( electrical crackling ) No , dad , no ! Go , go ! No , dad ! Dad , no ! No ! I think joe 's right , That the dome 's shutting down . ( screaming ) I 'm guessing we 've got a few more hours . ( screaming ) come on , buddy . ( hysterical screaming ) dad ! I know , buddy . Let 's go , come on , guys . ( indistinct shouting ) Sam : Get as much gauze as you can find . Her abdomen 's rigid- - she 's bleeding internally . Lyle might have lacerated an organ . Sam , I know you can help . Do something , all right ? She 's gonna need surgery to stop the bleeding . Well , then , operate . Do whatever you have to ... I 'm not a surgeon ! And we don 't have anesthesia or equipment . I can 't even tell which organ is injured without an mri . Listen , there is an answer- - find it ! Please , you have to help her . I 'm doing everything I can . No signal . I 'm sorry . It was a good idea , though . So , the crater didn 't create a crack in the dome , And there 's no new tunnel . Maybe it did , but somebody 's blocking the signal . Yeah , or maybe it 's just a giant , killer suckhole . We 're literally hours from being crushed to death . Maybe I should just go find my mom , And spend my last few hours with her , Instead of trying to convince myself That whoever or whatever controls this dumb dome ... Even gives a crap about any of us . Norrie , I need you here with me , okay ? Hey . Hey , wh-what are you doing ? Plan b . Joe , you 're not going down there . This is my town- - yours , too , now . If we don 't do anything , we all die . If we explore the crater , then we might be able To find a way to save everyone . He 's right . We know the dome better than anyone . You 're okay , pauline . What happened ? Lyle tried to take you away from me . He stabbed you . But he 's dead now . Everything 's gonna be okay , I promise . Can we give her something for the pain ? We 've got morphine . Just ten milligrams , okay ? Jim . Yeah . We should talk . Okay , I 'll be right back . She looks good- - on the mend . The internal damage is too massive To control without surgery . I can keep her as comfortable as possible , But there is nothing I can do to stop her from bleeding out . What are you saying , that she 's gonna die ? If there was something else- - Anything , I would do it . Big jim : I don 't accept that . Pauline came back to save us , Not bleed out in front of her son . The dome won 't let her die . This is just another test . My family , my wife ... We were chosen . We 've got to get mom back to the crater . Melanie didn 't just disappear into thin air . It must lead somewhere . I hope it does , junior , But pauline 's injuries are too severe . If we move her , it will accelerate the bleeding . She needs fluids . Where do I get saline ? The clinic ? I 'll find it . It is another tunnel . But it 's different than the one underneath the school What are those things ? I don 't know , But they 're cool . Yeah , and kind of terrifying . All right , let 's do this . I hope we can find melanie down here . Norrie : Careful . Come on . You okay , mom ? Just a little pain . Can we give her ... Some more morphine ? We don 't want to give her an overdose . Oh , junior , it 's okay . Dad 's coming back . Okay ? And we 're gonna fix you up ... Just like melanie . Do you think she 's okay ? That she made it out ? Anything 's possible . ( moans ) my brushes and canvas . What do you mean ? Maybe I can paint the way out . Junior , it 's important . Now go get them . James . We 've been through so much . I got to see my sweet , sweet boy become a man . I love you , mom . I love you ... Forever . ( quietly ) : Forever . ( panting ) What you said to junior- - It sounded like a good-bye . We both know the truth . I 'm not going to make it . We just have to get you stable . If the crater 's a way out , we 'll take you . No . The dome 's done with me . I saw my own death . Pauline . All that matters is junior . That he survives . And jim won 't let me go . I don 't want that . What are you saying ? Let me go peacefully . Becky , help me . Please . I think you were supposed to be here for this . I don 't know about that . I 've still got to go grab that gear , Get back to the crater , Figure out what 's down there . I 'll take aidan back to the high school , While you head back . Well , wait for me at the school . All right ? Grab a walkie from sam . I 'll be in touch . All right , honey , we 're gonna head this way , okay ? What do we do about this fork ? Which way ? I have no idea . Joe , look . I think we just made our decision . How long do you think the crater 's gonna stay open ? I-I don 't know . Not long . We 've got to tell barbie there might be a way out . Hey ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? What part of " don 't do anything stupid " did you not understand ? There was a monarch down there , too . It-it showed us a path- - with a light at the end . Did you see where it goes ? We had to get out , things are shaky down there . The passage may not be open for long . But it goes somewhere . And , like I said before , anywhere 's better than here . It doesn 't look like your dad 's showing up The time between its contractions is getting shorter . And the dome 's making the weather worse . All right , well , we 're going down the crater . It 's our only shot . Julia ! I think we got another chance . This might be the way out of here . Thanks . Sam . Rebecca . The crater could be the way out . We 've got to gather the town . Okay , well , most everyone 's either here , at the sweet briar , Or the church . All right , well , round them up . We 've got to get everybody to the woods . How ? Uh ... School buses . They run on diesel . There 's a whole fleet . Got to be fuel left in some of them . I 'll check it out . Round up the wounded- - All right , anyone who can 't fit on the buses will just walk . Jim , what are you doing here ? I 'm looking for saline , someone 's hurt . W-well , didn 't you hear the plan ? We 're leaving . Everyone . Did you find any saline ? No , leave it . We have to round everyone up . Julia said there isn 't much time . Listen , if I don 't find that saline , my wife dies ! I knew it ! Like it was waiting for me ! Hey . Your mom 's here . Julia wants our help loading up the buses . What 's wrong ? Do you really think we 're gonna get out ? I mean , the tunnels are freaky , but , yeah , we 'll make it . It 's not the tunnels . It 's what 's after that . Am I just supposed to go back to my life in california ? Without my mom ? How can I go and just leave her here ? Hey , she 's not here . Neither is angie . They might be buried in chester 's mill , But they 'll always be with us . Do you know why I was going to boot camp ? Why I 'm here in the first place ? I assumed you got into some kind of trouble . ( laughs gently ) I punched some stupid girl In the mouth and knocked her tooth out . And all she did was make fun of my hair . It 's just so ... Stupid to think how much I cared . If I had just ignored her ... No , the dome wanted you here . It would have found another way . I don 't care what the dome wanted . Because I just want my mom . Sometimes I think , on dome day , If angle and I just went to brunch with my mom ... But then I never would have met you . My mom told me before she died to be brave . And I just don 't feel brave right now . Look , I don 't know what 's gonna happen , But , whatever 's out there , We 're gonna face it together . Okay . No . No . Pauline , there 's news . The passage you opened- - We 're evacuating everyone through it . So , if-if you can just hold on , We can try and get you to a doctor . ( moans ) I won 't make it . I 'll only slow down the people I love . It 's just a little longer . You can do it . No , this is what the dome wants . I paid for my sins . ( sighs ) For once , I 'll be able to sleep without dreaming . No , there 's hope now . We 're only getting out because of you . Good . Junior will be safe . Aah . This is so much pain . Please ... Be kind . Please . Ah , sweet girl . Sweet girl . Can you help me and make sure everyone has a seat ? Yeah , okay . Thanks , aidan . If it wasn 't enough of a mess already . The dome 's contractions must be messing With the weather patterns ... Or something . Norrie : No ! Come with me now . I told you a hundred times , I need to stay here . I 'm one of the four hands . I have to help . I 'm not asking you , eleanor . Hey , hey , hey . Get on this first bus , I 'm really gonna need your help Once we get to that crater . Okay . Thank you . Okay , come on . Julia ! Have you seen andrea ? She 's getting supplies . She 's gonna meet us at the crater . ( thunder crashes ) All right , don 't stop . Let 's go ! Keep moving . Load up ! Keep moving . Hey , where 's pauline ? She 's still inside . We 're waiting for jim to get back from the clinic . Well , he 'd better hurry with that saline . How is your sister ? Big jim : Let me through ! I got the saline . Got it , come on . Do what you can for pauline , and then let 's go . I 'll see you soon . Baby , I got it for ya . I found the stuff you need . I told you the dome was looking after us . ( mumbles ) pauline , I 'm back , honey . Jim , My pain is gone . That 's good . That 's good , that 's real good . I told you it 's gonna be okay . I know you love me . I 'm sorry . You don 't need to be sorry . ( whispering ) : You don 't need to be sorry . Pauline ? Look at me . What 's wrong ? Her pulse is dropping . ( sighs ) take care of junior . Pauline ... I love you all ... I just got you back . You did this . She said it was what the dome wanted . She begged me . You always have the solutions , don 't you ? It was a kind thing to do . I 'm sorry . Always got something in your ... In your back pocket for every emergency . It was her last request . Oh , now you can kill ? When it 's my wife ? Jim , That this is what the dome wanted ... The dome wanted my family together . And you got in the way . Walk away , jim . Go find junior , And get him out of here . I 'll miss my wife forever . No one 's gonna miss you . ( screams ) Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! Oh , my god . ( moaning ) Sam . ( groans ) Get up . What happened ? Oh , no . No ! Where 's mom ? She 's gone . What do you mean ? Pauline asked rebecca to help her ... End her life . She was in so much pain . Jim went after rebecca . I tried to stop him , I couldn 't . I 'm so sorry , junior . Mom was starting to say good-bye . We 've got to find your dad- - he 's gone crazy . We 've got to talk him down . Why would I do that ? There 's no talking to him , there 's only dealing with him . Why 'd you paint that , pauline ? I wish you hadn 't . ¶ ¶ Dome- - I 'll make you a deal . If you bring her back right now I won 't murder every single one Of your special little friends . I won 't slit julia 's throat , Shoot barbie in the heart , Or burn those kids alive . Okay ? You got three seconds . Okay then . I 'm gonna free you from all this . So you can go right through that dome wall . And it 's gonna regret what it did to us . I promise . ¶ ¶ This is the same plan that we had before . We 're all gonna break up into small groups , Keeping your family with you . We will call you forward one-by-one and get you down . Once your entire group is down , Joe and norrie , here , will guide you into ... How do you know this is safe ? I know because I 've done it before . And , look , I know you 're all scared . Okay ? I-I-I know that I 'm a stranger . But for the last two weeks , we have fought together For the survival of this town . But , right now , I need you to trust me . 'cause we don 't have another choice . If we stay here , we die . Now , come on ! Let 's get out of here ! ( speaking low , indistinctly ) Carolyn , listen- - I need you to go down with me , okay ? Help me keep everyone calm . Julia , hunter . Hey , can I get you guys to stay at the top here ? All right ? Keep everything orderly . Make sure we don 't leave anyone behind . Am I forgetting anything ? No . You 're doing exactly what you 're supposed to . I love you . I love you , too . All right , you guys ready ? Let 's do it . All right , everybody- - group one , stick with me . Just stay calm , all right ? We 're gonna be fine . Let 's go . Hold on , hold on . It 's okay , guys- - we 've been here before . There 's no need to be afraid . Careful . All right , carolyn . ( rumbling ) Crack 's getting wider . You okay ? Yeah . All right . Everybody watch your step , all right ? We 'll help you cross . Okay , how are we doing ? Most folks are accounted for . Andrea : Julia , please be there . Andrea ? What 's wrong ? Where are you ? I 'm at my house . I need help . I ... Oh , god ! Andrea ? Andrea ! Andrea . Andrea ? Andrea ? ( weakly ) : In here . I knew you 'd come running . Put the bat down . Sam : Julia , come in . ( whispering ) : Less is more . Julia ? Hey , sam . What do you need ? You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just helping andrea . We 're headed back now . Junior and I are at the crater With hunter . Listen , you should know , um ... Pauline is dead . And jim killed rebecca . He 's out there somewhere . Got to go now , sam . What are you doing , jim ? Payback . Andrea : Against me ? What did I ever do , Except be your neighbor and friend ? It 's not about you , honey . Sam forgot to mention that rebecca murdered pauline . Yeah . I gave the dome a chance To return her to me , But it declined . Which is bad for you . Killing me ... Won 't bring pauline back . Yeah , but it might ruin some of the dome 's plans . And that 's good enough . Andrea was your friend . Yeah , I know . That 's why I killed her quick . You don 't get that privilege . ( shouts ) Do you know why the dome didn 't bring pauline back ? Because you 're a joke . 'cause the dome doesn 't make deals With insects like you . Even your wife knew you were meaningless . I 'm gonna like you a lot better with your mouth broken . ( screams ) All right , everybody . Come on . Keep moving forward . Keep moving forward , you 'll catch up with the next group . All right ? Let 's go . Everything 's gonna be fine . All right , julia- - how many we got left ? Uh , only a few- - I 'm sending them down now . Where 's julia ? She left to help a friend . Where is she right now ? I don 't know- - she 's not answering her walkie . ( gunshot ) ( screams ) Junior : Julia ! Here ! Are you okay ? Jim killed andrea , he 's behind me . Junior . Go without me . No , no . I 'm not gonna let you go alone . I said- - go ! Put your arm around me . What are you doing , son ? I 'm not your son anymore . I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else . How you gonna do that ? You 're not leaving this town . You don 't tell me what to do . Not you . Not the dome . This is my town , little boy . Enjoy what 's left of it . ( grunts ) Oh , god . You made it . What happened ? Jim . Where is he ? Where is he ? Barbie , there 's no time . Junior 's taking care of it . Jim 's not getting down here . All right . I 'll take her . Let 's go . Can you take aidan up ahead ? You just go on , all right ? I 'll be right behind you . Okay . Come on . Hunter , go up front with joe and norrie . Tell them to move out . All right ? Okay . We 'll catch up . Nice and slow . Junior ! ( julia grunting ) All right . You 're gonna have to jump . Think you can do it ? I 'll get across and I 'll give you a hand . All right . Come on . Step up , give me your hand . Okay . ( rumbling ) ( coughs ) I can 't make it . No , there 's got to be another way . I 'm not leaving you here . You don 't have a choice . The town needs your help , and fast- - Before the tunnels cave in on them . The dome chose you . Barbie , listen to me . Of someone guiding everyone out of the dome . She didn 't see his face , but it 's you . But everything we 've done for this town , we 've done together . It 's okay . The dome has gotten us this far . I have faith ... That if you do what it 's asking ... It will protect me . ( rumbling ) I 'm coming back for you . I know . Junior ! Junior , you can 't leave me ! Junior ! Barbie , where 's julia ? She 's coming . She sent me up ahead . Why 's everybody stopped ? Nobody knows which way to go . Norrie : Barbie , we need to go this way . We saw the butterfly go down there . I think it 's a sign . Both joe and I do . All right , this is the way . Okay ? Everybody follow me . What happened ? Barbie went ahead , he 'll come back for us . Then we 'll figure out a way across . ¶ ¶ No , this can 't be all that 's there . It can 't be . Is this a cave in ? Barbie , what do we do now ? I don 't ... I don 't know . We didn 't come all this way for a dead end . Screw you ! Can you hear me ? ! Whoever you are controlling all of this , Can you just talk to us and tell us what 's going on ? ! ¶ ¶ How did you ... ? I have no idea . ( debris crumbling ) What 's that noise ? ( crackling ) Melanie ? Follow me . We 're going home . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

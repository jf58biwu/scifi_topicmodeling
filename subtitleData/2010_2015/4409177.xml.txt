 Hey , okay ... now ... let 's go again . - Which one 's this , number9 ? - Yeah , number 9 . Bright eyes . Are you watching this ? This ... this is unbelieveable . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . - How many moves was that ? - 20 . The perfect score is 15 . God , what 're you , what 're you giving her ? Hey , give me that video ! Chimp number 9 , just one dose . - Couldn 't I see you later ? - We 're good to go . I 'm gonna call you back . Yeah , all right . Thanks , Bye . 1-12 , it works . - On just the one primate ? - One is all we need . Full cognitive recovery . We 're ready . Look , are you sure you 're not rushing this ? I 've been working on this for five and a half years . The data is clear . We 're ready , Steven . All I need is your approval for human trials . Look , for this , you 're gonna need the Board 's approval . There 's a lotta money riding on this , Will . - You only get one shot . - One shot is all I need . [ sighs ] All right . I 'll need to see all the research . You got it ! - Oh , Will ... - Yeah ? Keep your personal emotions out of it . These people invest in results , not dreams . Okay ! Meet chimp 9 . Here she 's tasking at what is called the Lucas Tower . The object of which is to move the tower from peg to peg ... without placing a larger block on top of a smaller block . As expected , she was unable to complete the puzzle at all . Then , we gave her what we call , ALZ-1-12 , a gene therapy ... that allows the brain to create its own cells in order to repair itself . In biology , this is called neurogenesis . Here , at GEN-SYS ... we call it a cure to Alzheimer 's . - Donnie , you get her ready ? - She 's got stage fright . Is that what it is ? Hey , ape . She 's gonna break my arm ! Bright Eyes ! Let go ! You all right ? We 're ready to move on to the next phase . That 's human trials . Here you go , Bright Eyes . It 's your favorite fizzy soda . Come on , let 's go , Donnie . We should have her downstairs already . Okay . Good girl ! Come on out , girl , that 's right . That 's for you . Gonna get you . Come back ! Don 't do that ! - Come back ! - Jesus ! Donnie , open the cage ! Donnie , open up ! Open up ! Open that cage ! Gonna sedate her ! - No , no ! - Get the door ! Hold it ! No , no , no , no ! No , no , no , no ! Get the reinforcement now ! Get it now ! Call help ! Donnie , Donnie ! Come on . There have been absolutely no side effects associated with 1-12 , with one exception . For some reason , the chimps irises exhibit flecks of green . Actually , we first noticed it in chimp 9 , uh , hence her nickname , Bright Eyes . You 'll see when we bring her in . Go ! Move ! In theory , this therapy can be used ... to treat a wide range of brain disorders . It 's virtually limitless . As are the potential profits , which is why we are confident , that you will vote ... to approve human trials . No , no , no ! Mr. Jacobs , Mr. Jacobs , I am begging you , I am begging you , not to do this . Look , it costs a small fortune ... to run lab workups on all of those chimps ... only to tell me what I already know , that they are contaminated . There are lives at stake here . These ... these are animals with personalities , with attachments . - Attachments ? - Yeah . I run a a business , not a petting zoo . Find the most cost effective way to put those apes down . - I can 't do that . - You 're the chimp handler . Handle it . Steven ! Well , that was fun ! They 've taken the 1-12 . The board has rejected your proposal . They have chosen to advance other programs . Well , there must be something that you can do . Yes , there is . I could fire you . Believe me , we talked about it . We have five years of conclusive data . Parade all the data you want , you will never convince anyone to invest another dime . This drug has the potential to save lives ! Bankrupt this company , more like . I swear , you know everything about the human brain ... except the way it works . Go back to the drawing board on the 1-12 . Start again in molecular development . Find a way to get there before someone else does . And , clean up this mess . Franklin ! It 's very small . She must 've been pregnant when we brought her in . So that 's why ... ? She wasn 't being aggressive . She was just being protective . She thought we 're gonna hurt her baby . I would take it myself , but ... my brother-in-law works for security . He 'd rat me out in a seceond . - Come on . - You want me to take it home ? I can 't take care of a monkey . - He 's not a monkey ! He 's an ape . - Franklin ... Just you know , it 's just for a couple days ... until I find a sanctuary . That 's all I need . Franklin , no ! Look , this isn 't my responsibility . This is ... this is company property . Okay ... I tell you what , Doc . Jacobs made me put down the other 12 . I 'm done . Be my guest . - Hey ! - Oh , hi . - You look beat . - Yeah . How 's he doing ? Well , he has good days and bad days . Mh-hm . Today , not so good , although he has been quoting Shakespeare . Oh , you got a pet ? Uh ... it 's just a temporary house guest . Well , maybe that 'll be good for him . Good night ! Hi , Dad ! Dad ? Will ! ... I didn 't hear you come in . Today 's the day , right ? You thought I 'd forget ? You have a big test today , right ? Chemistry ? Hey , Dad ... - Wanna see something ? - What ? What is that ? Is he injured ? No , I think that 's a birthmark . " As for Caesar , kneel down , kneel down and wonder ! " Yeah , don 't get too attached . He 's a cute little guy , isn 't he ? Where 's my car keys ? My car keys , where 'd you put ' em ? Dad ... you , uh ... you don 't ... you don 't drive anymore . I know that . Here ... Why don 't you feed him . Can you do that ? Of course , I can .. Will ! ... Look at this ! How old is he ? Like , a day old ? Two days old ? Yeah . He 's a smart one , isn 't he ? What you gonna name him ? I don 't know . Right away , Caesar displayed signs of intelligence heightened intelligence , so I kept him ... and brought my work home . By 18 months , Caesar was signing up to ... 24 words . By age two , Caesar was completing puzzles and models ... designed for children eight years and up . At age three , Caesar continues to show cognative skills ... that far exceed that of his human counterpart . Home ... home . He completed the Lucas Tower in 15 moves , a perfect score . I maintain my hypothesis that , A : The green in his eyes indicate ... that the ALZ-1-12 was passed genetically from mother to son ... and B : That in the absence of damaged cells that needed replacing ... the drug in his system has radically boosted healthy brain functioning . And ... plays chess pretty well . Dad ! - I 'm sorry . - I can 't do this , anymore . He belongs in a home . This is no way for him to live . That 's no way to live ? No way to ... no way to live ? My lamp ... I broke my lamp . It 'll make you better , Dad . Shhh ... Dad ! Dad ! Todd , come inside for breakfast . I 'll need to keep track of what I take from the lab , although I don 't see you needing more than one treatment a month . Something amazing has happened ! I 'll need a blood test , a scan and the dosage ... carefully monitored . Now , if I can sneak some ... Will ! ... I 'm not sick , anymore ! It was nothing , Dad . Ceasar ? Where is Caesar ? I wanna see him . Caesar ! Caesar ! He can 't have gone far . Caesar ! Daddy ! Caesar ! Get outta here ! Get out ! Get out ! Hey , hey , hey ! Enough ! Enough ! It doesn 't matter what you do . If I catch that animal anywhere near my house or my kids again ... He 's not dangerous . It won 't happen again . Damn right , it won 't ! Come on , Dad . - He ... he just wanted to play . Stay in the house ! Daddy 's got you . I told you not to go out without us . It 's okay . How bad is it ? I don 't know . - He likes you . - Uh-huh . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon . Then we go get a treat . I 'm thinking , Ice cream . Good idea ! You taught him to sign ? Just ... handful of things , - basic stuff . - Oh . What 's he saying ? Nothing . Uh , so ... so when do you think we should come back ? Well , you won 't need to come back . because , um ... the stiches are dissolveable . I would just say , watch for signs of infection . Fever ... redness . Okay , what 's he saying , now ? Um ... well ... he thinks that ... you and I should have dinner together . I know . Caesar ! Come on ! Good to see you , again , Caroline . You coming , Caesar ? So , what 's your secret ? Oh , I ... I can 't take any credit . It 's in his genes . I think you 're being very modest . He 's pretty amazing . I think you 've ... built a pretty good home for Caesar , here . You probably right . You know he won 't stay this way for long . And he 's soon growing into a ... large , powerful , animal . Come here ! How 's he been doing ? Okay , I think . I love chimpanzees . I 'm also afraid of them . And it 's appropriate to be afraid of them . Caesar will never hurt anyone . He 's happy here . Yeah , I can see that . We can at least give him some open space ? Yeah . That probably 'd be a good idea . I know a place right across the bridge , the Redwoods . It 's a paradise . Come on ! Come here . Doesn 't need a leash ! He 'll be fine . Come on ! - Just to be safe . Come on . - Come on , Caesar ! It 's the Redwoods . Caesar ! All right . If I take this off , you can not leave my sight . I 'll never find you again . Okay . - What 's this ? - What 's he doing ? I don 't believe that ! - What ? He 's asking your permission . It 's a supplicating gesture . It 's okay . Come on , Caesar . Off you go ! Look at him go ! Caesar ! Caesar ! - Caesar ! - Caesar ! Caesar ! There you are . Caesar ! Come on , Caesar , climb ! Go higher ! Climb ! Be careful ! Caesar , be careful ! Hey . Hi ! What 's going on , buddy ? Give some love . Come on , honey . Is that a chimpanzee ? Come on ! Come on . Caesar ! Caesar ! Come on ! It 's all right . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . You getting in ? Caesar ? You okay , pal ? Are you pet ? No . You 're not a pet . I 'm your father . What is Caesar ? Okay . Caesar , this is where I work . This is were you were born . Your mother was here with ... other chimpanzees . But she 's not here anymore . So ... that 's why I took home to live with me . Yeah . Your mother 's dead . The thing is , she was given medicine , like the medicine I give to Charles . She passed it on to you . That 's why you 're so smart . Let 's take him home . Come on . Explain it to me . All right . I snuck him outta the lab to save his life . I had no idea that the effects had been transfered vertically from his mother . But , since then , he 's been displaying incredible signs intelligence . I designed the 1-12 to repair , but Caesar 's gone way beyond that . Here 's his IQ from last year . Since then , it 's doubled . This is all wrong . My father was on gone , this drug brought him back . You never saw how bad he was . He has his life again . And , what about Caesar ? - What about him ? How does he fit in ? With me ? With us ? Listen ... I know it 's been hard for you , but you 're trying to control things that were never meant to be controlled . The 1-12 works . Do you realize how you sound ? All I 'm saying is this is a good thing . Caesar is proof of that . So 's my father . Caesar , eat your food . Dad , you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Antibodies . His system has found a way to fight the 1-12 virus ... so that it can 't deliver its therapy . My father 's disease is going to return with a vengence . Stop ! You stop , right now ! Hey ! Hey ! Get outta there ! Get outta that car ! What in the hell you 're doing ? Get outta my car ! I said , get out of my car ! I 'm a pilot ! I gotta get to the airport ! How am I gonna get there now , huh ? Answer the God-damn question ! What were you doing ? I have a car just exactly ... Will you stop talking ! You know what ? I 'm done ... I 'm done . The police can handle it . Stay right there ! You ain 't going nowhere , mister ! You will pay ! This is your problem , you made that happen ! What 're we gonna do with you ? Just stay right there ! Caesar , stop ! Daddy ! Caesar ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . He didn 't mean it . It 's okay . Hey ! Hey , take that thing off of him ! Take that thing off of him ! Look , I 'll take him in , okay ? No , we got a court orders . We can 't do that . It 's fine ! Let ' em . Bring him in when you 're ready . Take it off . Thank you ! Caesar , Caesar , Caesar . Caesar , Caesar . Not right now . It 's gonna be okay . Let 's just see what it 's like inside , okay ? Come on , Caesar . Let 's go . Come on ... trust me . It 's okay . Go . He hasn 't spent any time with other chimps . Oh , we 're used to that . He 'll be a little skittish at first , but we 'll integrate him . You 'd be surprised how quick they adapt . We provide a stimulating environment . He 's gonna thrive here . Come , let 's do some paperwork . Oh , and you better make sure you lock that door when you come in . Caesar ! You will be okay ! Everything 's gonna be okay ! Don 't be scared . You 're gonna be staying here , now . No ... Your not going home right now . It 's okay . - The only * * * * is ... the longer you drag out the good-byes , the harder it is . Can I sign that later ? You 'll probably miss him more than he 'll miss you . You best give him a couple of weeks to get used to the place . Will , we have to go . We have to go home . Coming back soon , okay ? Just call ahead , before you do . Hey , over here ! Hey , I can get you out ! Come on ! Over here ! Hey , down here . Stupid monkey . Just come on ! You can make it . You can make it . The court order hasn 't been filed , so it 's not in the system . Once it comes through , it 'll take about 90 days before you receive an appeal date . - 90 days ? - Yes , sir , 90 days . You 'll be notified by mail . Hey , hey . Here 's what 's gonna happen . You can go back to your computer , you know , shift things around ... and you 're gonna get me a date for my appeal , this week , you got it ? I can 't help you . All right , then we have a problem , because I 'm not moving until you do . 90 days , sir . Be thankful you 're talking about court dates . You 're lucky they didn 't put that animal down . I promised to get him back soon , Dad . Dad ? My father 's immune system continues to reject the 1-12 virus , rendering the gene therapy obsolete . His health is deteriorating , and the disease is progressing rapidly . I need a more aggressive virus strain , a faster delivery method . Because at this rate ... I can 't lose them both . I won 't lose them both . Hey ! Can we talk ? Make it fast . I got a meeting . The ten years you 've been running GEN-SYS , how many drugs have come down the pipeline that could save millions of lives ? That could change everything ? What 're you talking about ? The ALZ-1-12 . What happened to you , Will ? You used to be the star of this lab . Now , you hardly ever show up ... and when you do , you waste your time and that of your team 's . Fixating on a drug ... that after what happened , is never ever gonna get approved . The 1-12 is dangerous , Will , and it doesn 't work . I treated my father with it . It does work . You did , what ? It beat the disease , like we predicted . - Brilliant . - There 's been a complication . Well , does it work or doesn 't it ? My father 's disease eventually outran the cure . Oh , for goodness sake . The immune system produced antibodies to beat the viral component , but it will work . I 've already developed a virus strain ... that I think will be more aggressive . You think ? Just , let me test it . You 're wasting my time . There 's more ! The applications go beyond the disease . There indications that show the therapy can improve cognitive functioning , memory quality ... What ? What are you saying ? My father didn 't just recover . He improved . You mean , increased intelligence ? It 's not conclusive , but yes . I want you , to start testing the revised 1-12 on chimps , ASAP . Okay . I 'll give you whatever you need , but get started . Dinner time ! Mm ... Great Ape , primate ! Go on ... don 't you know food when you see it ? You think that 's funny , huh ? I 'll show you something funny ! You 'll learn who 's boss , soon enough . - What about his clothes ? - What about ' em ? I don 't know ... it may cause problems with the other apes . Good ! - I counted ten apes , correct ? - Yep . Good . All the way in the back . You guys moving really quick on this . What 's the big rush ? First day back , you 're still complaining . Koba . Hi , I 'm Will . This one . This one . He 's very calm . Yeah . He 's been through a whole lotta labs . He knows the drill . Could I join you ? What 's our progress . Get him prepped . Tighten your masks . Pass me the 1-13 . Pulse-ox is good , blood pressure is steady . Perisol delivery , in place . Releasing the 1-13 . We got a break ! Stay right there ! Franklin , get your mask on ! Okay . Got it . You got it ? - Yeah . Oh , oh , oh ... - We got a break . - You okay ? - Right there . Yeah , okay . Move it . Let 's go ! Get up and exercise , you lazy baboons ! Intelligence results are remarkable . There are no adverse effects . Apes have amazingly strong immune systems . All right , keep an eye on him . Okay . Sorry about that . These guys are more resiliant then I am . Excuse me a second . He 's good . We will be working late tonight . GEN-SYS needs three more . Hey ! Hey , Caesar ! Are you hurt ? You hurt ? Show me . Caesar , give me your hand . Give me your hand . Sometimes the new kid on the block , gets picked on . Stay calm . What have they done to you ? That 's bullshit ! Hey , let go off me ! What 's the problem here ? I 'm taking him out of here , right now . Not without a court order , you 're not . He 's not yours , anymore . I promise , if I find out he 's been mistreated in any way , I 'll have this place shut down . Go on . No . No , we 're not going home , right now . I 'm gonna get you outta here , I promise . You have to trust me . Caesar , you have to trust me , okay ? I think this visit 's over . Trust me . You 'll be okay . No , no , no , no , no , no ! Come on , move it . Let 's go ! Wow ! There are hundreds of them ! Looks like you 're own private zoo ! More like a prison for hairy dudes . They watch TV ? We call it enrichment . Aw , this one 's so cute ! What 's his name ? Uh ... name 's Cornelia . It 's a she . - Oh , my God ! - Don 't get too close ! This one scared me half to death . That big guy is called , Maurice . That 's no fun . Here , I 'll show you something fun . Check this out ! It 's crazy ! You , uh ... you ... you shouldn 't be in here . Hey , you 're next ! Come on , let 's go . Spent too much time in here , as it is . Come on ! Check out this guy . Hey , Alan , he 's a pain in the ass . He thinks he 's special , or something . Freaky ! Hey , come here . I think he 's thinking or something . Oh , my God , he 's got him by the throat ! Let him go ! Let go ! Are you okay ? I 'm okay . I told you not to get too close , man . Come on , guys , let 's get outta here . Some things aren 't meant be changed . You need to accept that . Hey ! Hey ! What 's going on here ? More 1-13 trials . We 're just prepping ... Oh , no , we have to analyze Koba 's blood work first ! Franklin knows this . Where is he ? He 's been out sick for two days . Well , I didn 't authorized this . No ! I did . We agreed to test sparingly on one subject . And , that one subject is stunning ! It 's a virus . We don 't know the human related effects . The drug works , Will . Tell him , Linda . For starters , Koba scored a perfect 15 on the Lucas Tower . Every test result verifies its effectiveness . - No more tests . - What are you ... ? Not until we have a better understanding of what we 're dealing with . Look , I 'll tell you exactly what we deal ... Look ... Give us a minute . Uh ... excuse me ! Put the ape back in the cage . Be gentle . Will ... I 'll tell you exactly what we 're dealing with , here . We 're dealing with a drug that is worth more ... than everything else we are developing , combined . You make history , I make money . - Isn 't that our arrangement ? - No ! There are risks . Don 't you tell me about risks . You give your own father an experimental drug . I could finish your career with one phone call . I 'll save you the trouble . I quit . We will proceed without you . Look ... You don 't know what you 're doing . These tests need to be contained . You have no idea if the 1-13 is stable , what kinda damage it can do to people ... Well , that is why we test it on chimps ... isn 't it ? Dr. Rodman , it 's , me , Franklin ! I need to talk to you ! Can you come to the door ? Doc ! Who the hell are you ? Get outta here ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You wouldn 't be trying to entrap me , would you ? Well ... I can 't say that I approve . They 're not people , you know . You gonna to let him go or not ? Caesar ... Hey , come on . Come on , we 're going home . Home . Come on , we 're really going . Let 's get outta here . Yeah . Come on . Caesar ? I guess he likes it better here with his own kind . Damn it , Rodney , You leave the hose out in the atrium , again ? - What ? - No ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Come on , Get up ! Eight months after its launch , Earth 's first manned space flight to Mars ... I ain 't dodging . I 'm telling the truth . Yeah , well , if he didn 't take my cookies , - then , who the hell did , huh ? - I ... I do not know ... Hey ! Will you two morons knock it off ! I 'm going home . Recovered in water and therefore able to sustain life . I get more peace in the God-damn ape house . Dad , I 'm sorry ! I 'll think about it . Mr. Franklin , it 's Dottie ! Mr. Franklin ? ... Hello ? What the hell ? Rodney , get to the platform , now . Rodney ! What the hell do you think you 're doing , huh ? Get ! Go on ! Get back in your cage ! I 'm warning you ! Go on , get ! That 's it ! See ! That 's what you get ! Get back ! What 's wrong with you ? Dumb monkey ! Take your stinking paw off me , you damn dirty ape ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No , no , no , no ... no , no , no , no ! No ! I 'll beat all ! Caroline , have you been up to Caesar 's room ? No one 's answering . Landon ! Will ? Will ! What happened ? He spoke . What are you ... what ? Your ape ... he spoke . What in the hell ? I don 't believe this . I 'll beat each and everyone of you . I need someone to coordinate with the S.F.P.D. Tell ' em we got a fatality . - What is it ? - I know where he 's headed . Lenny ? Let 's go ! - Jacobs . - Mr. Jacobs , it 's Linda ... from Will 's team . Look , something horrible has happened . Franklin is dead from a viral infection . What the hell you talking about ? He was exposed to the 1-13 . It does something to people that it doesn 't do to apes . We have to go through the city across the bridge . Mr. Jacobs ? Mr. Jacobs , are you ... What the hell ? I 'm Steven Jacobs ! It 's full of apes in there . I gotta get in the air ! We have to be able to destroy them . Just , trust me on this , okay ? You might wanna get your cameras ready . Normally , these guys are quit shy . They 're just going through the park , on the north side ! They 're being led ! You gotta hold the button . The button ! They 're being led . These apes are smarter than you think . I know , we got the leader ! No way ... Do not tell them I am stuck in traffic . Make up with something smarter ! Hold on . What is that ? ... They 're on the bridge . They 're trying to get to the Redwoods . SFPD , Police 1 . This is Air Ops . Seal of the south end . What 's the status of those units ? Ready to go , sir . Alright , as soon as they reach you , push north . North side , we 're gonna push them right to you . No problem . We 're ready for them . The north side is blocked . They never gonna get through here . As soon as they hit the gap , we 'll take them out ! - You gonna just shoot them ? - Like shooting fish in a barrel . Good ! Look , turn that thing around ! - Get off this bridge , sir . - No , no , we can 't ... You don 't understand . Get off this bridge , now ! This is an evacuation . Get out ! All the civilians , clear . Please confirm . Get these people off the bridge ! Stand by , city mounted units ! They 're gonna slaughter them . I 'm gonna to get Caesar . Will , hey , hey ! You , be careful ! I gotta get to my car ! Get outta here ! Let go . Let go off me ! I have to get my car ! Hey ! Push ' em north ! Get outta the way ! No ! Hurry , we 're gonna lose them in the fog . Do it ! Where are they ? I don 't see ' em ! CHP North , do you have a visual ? No , sir , negative . Safety 's off ! Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Get back ! Get back ! Get back ! Caesar ! That 's him ! That 's the leader ! They 're in sight ! Put ' em down ! Help me , help me . Help me ! Take my hand ! Hey , come ... come on . Come on . Not you ... No . Go away ! Save me , you lucky ape ! Caesar ! Caesar ? Caesar ... I 'm sorry . This is my fault . This has to stop . This isn 't the way . You know what they 're capable of . Please come home . If you come home , I 'll protect you . Caesar is home . Okay . Caesar 's home . Go .

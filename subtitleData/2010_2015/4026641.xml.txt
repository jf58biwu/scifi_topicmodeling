 Whether your computer 's ready or not , there are only 318 days till the year 2000 . A group of corporations concerned about the problems ... related to the Y2K computer bug have convened ... No . Don 't cry . Don 't cry . Hey . Everything 's gonna be okay . Hi . Everything 's gonna be okay , pal . Come here , come here . Yeah . That 's a good boy . Okay , don 't cry . She can 't hurt you anymore . It 's over . Come here . No one 's gonna hurt you ever again . My name is Louis Hicks . I 'm an investigative reporter . I cover stories of killers and criminals . Their lives are dark , without hope . I try not to let it affect me , but it 's hard . - Hey ! Gordo ! Two shots . - No ! - Yes , yes . - No , no , no , no . - I got to work in an hour . - Just one , just one . - No , no . - One shot , old-school . - One . One shot . - There it is . - To Louis . - Yeah . All right , now you do something for me . Let me buy you breakfast . Too late . I already ate . Breakfast of champions . How 's work ? Any compelling real-life stories I should know about ? Not today . Well ... How 's work for you , huh ? You working on the book ? Always . Always working , Gordo . So , speaking of which , what 's up on the work front ? Are you gonna take the university thing ? Me , an adjunct professor ? I suspect a few ethics questions remain . Louis , you 're a good writer . You 're a good investigator . Maybe ... Maybe this teaching thing is what you need to put it all back together . You know ? You know , show them that you can hold down a job , stay in one place , a little stability . Hey , maybe get more visitation time with Adam . That would be nice . How often you get to see him ? Weekends . Yeah . Most weekends . Louis , pal , I worry about you . Come on , the truth is , you don 't do so well on your own , you know ? What are you trying to say , Gordo ? Oh , God . The natives are getting restless . - There it is . - I got to go . Thanks anyway , Gordo . What would you do without me ? Can I get the check , please ? - Hey ! - Hey . I thought you were coming over later . Yeah , I just thought we should talk first . You 're wearing your wedding ring again ? I 'm sick of this , Louis . I 'm sick of it ! Felicia , wait . I 'm done waiting ! I 'm done ! Maybe your wife can handle it , but I can 't . Can 't believe that son of a bitch ! Whatever . You want to go back to your wife , fine . Good luck . I 'm done , done ! You 've been crying . You prosecuted Sampson Raines for those murders last year . Was it fun , Felicia ? Making all those headlines ? I bet it was . A lot more fun than taking on a low profile child abuse case , which got zero media coverage . The boy ! Are you the boy 's father ? No . No , I 'm not , Felicia . I 'm his guardian angel . Let 's see ... " Felicia Carson , single , lives alone , dies today . ' ' See ? It 's written . So , it 's gonna have to happen . Felicia ? Felicia ? Felicia ! 911 . What 's your emergency ? I need an ambulance , 717 Oak Lane . Are you hurt , sir ? No , there 's so much blood . Is someone else hurt ? I need more specifics . Hey ! Stay out of it ! Felicia Carson , Assistant District Attorney . It 's gonna be a long night , fellas . Well , well , look who it is . No , no , let him through . Louis Hicks . What 's the matter ? Work a little slow ? Glued to your police scanner again ? I was the one that found her . I called it in . - What were you doing here ? - We 're friends . Friends ? What happened to your head ? There was somebody inside the house with her . When he saw me , he took off . I chased him . We got into it , and he slammed me into a dumpster . - I 'll sign for it . Just get her on the bus . - Okay . You chased him , he slammed you . Where 'd he go ? I don 't know . I lost him . Man , I just ... He ... It 's like he just vanished . Vanished ? How ? You know , he was there , and then he was gone . So , what happened next ? I just passed out . Louis , what the hell happened to you ? Hold on there . Come here . Let 's get an ID . This your friend ? Pretty girl . It 's a shame . Load her up . She was a good person . Who would want to do this to her ? An Assistant DA ? Someone she put away , someone who wants attention , maybe random . Does this look random to you ? No , it looks crazy , serial crazy . When was the last time you saw her ? - I don 't know . Around 6 : 00 . - Tonight ? - Yeah . - Where ? Outside her office building . How long you two been together ? Two months . Maybe more . We met on a story . Sampson Raines murders . I remember the case . What I wrote in that article was nothing personal . Of course not . Wait here . I 'll get someone to take a full statement . I 'll help any way I can . The department appreciates your cooperation . See you later , Gordo . That guy 's a real prick . Hey , he took what you wrote about him pretty hard . You think ? I broke up with her tonight , Gordo . I can 't help but think , you know , if I hadn 't , you know , she was upset , her guard was down . This is not your fault . Come on . Let 's get somebody to look at that head of yours . Come on . Coming ! Hey , buddy ! I missed you , man ! - Can I borrow your laptop ? - You know where it is . Gina ? Morning , Louis . Did you forget ? No , no , I just had a rough night . Of course . Let me guess , you were busy researching a really hot story . What 's that supposed to mean ? Are you gonna take your son to the park this morning or not ? Louis , you made a huge deal about how important every weekend is to you now . Yes . Yes , I am . Fine . Look , I was gonna run some errands , - but if you 're a mess again ... - No ! No ! I 'm not a mess ! This , this , this is a mess . Morning , Hicks . Miss . Missus . Mrs. Hicks . Detective Becker , this is my wife , Gina . What can I do for you ? I wanted to follow up on a couple of things from the Carson murder last night . Murder ? Felicia Carson , an Assistant DA , was murdered in her home last night . Your husband found the body . Someone I knew was killed last night . I 'm sorry . A woman you knew ? A source . From the last Journal piece . My apologies for the early morning . I just wanted to get right on it . Wouldn 't want to be accused of sloppy police work in another true-crime article . Okay . Adam , honey , let 's go . But I want to see Dad . Yeah , I know , baby . Not today . Daddy 's busy . Gina , wait . But I want to watch the policeman . - Adam , now , please . - Gina . Look , this is a bad time . Why don 't you give me a call later this afternoon ? What gave that away ? Hey . A woman is dead . Good day . Gina . Gina ! Gina , wait a second . I 'm sorry , but I was involved . You are always involved , just never with the people who matter . Are you serious ? A woman was killed . - What ? A woman that you were fucking . - I wasn 't fucking her . Besides , we 've been separated for six months . Yeah , and I noticed that you 're still wearing your ring . Nice . Stop it . Listen , I saw the guy who did this , and I chased him . Save it for the goddamn book , Louis ! I don 't care anymore ! I 'm sure it 'll be great . Especially a firsthand account . I mean , you knew the victim intimately . I don 't know . God , I don 't know . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I just want to come home . No . You can 't do that . You can 't do that to me , not like this . You seriously need to get your shit together , Louis . Gina , wait . Hey , buddy . Sit back , baby . Shit . He 's gonna kill more of them . Hi . You 've reached my cell . Can 't come to the phone right now , but leave a brief message with your phone number , even if you think I have it . I 'll get back to you as soon as I can , unless I forget . Wait for the beep . You know what to do . Louis . What 's going on ? You okay ? We got to talk . Can I come in ? Yeah , yeah , of course . Come on . What time is it ? I went back to where I lost the guy . You did ... What the hell for ? You 're gonna love this , Gordo . You 're gonna love this . I got his journal , and he 's gonna kill again . I got names . I got dates . Wait , from what ? From this journal ? Yes . And that 's not all I got . I got a print . Louis , this is evidence . You 're gonna give it to Becker . Screw Becker . No , I can 't trust Becker . I need you to run it for me . Becker 's in charge on this . Look , any and all evidence you 've got to turn in . You promise you run the print , I 'll turn the journal in first thing . Give me the damn thing . - Can I go back to sleep now ? - Okay . All right . Hey ! Thank you , Gordo . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You know , it 's not nice to read someone 's private thoughts . How 'd you get in here ? I knew that I had recognized you . You used to be quite a writer . You had a genuine empathy for the outsiders , for the outcasts . I try to understand people without judging them . Why they do what they do . Why are you doing this ? I 'm just putting things right . Are you interviewing me ? For your next book , perhaps ? You want to be interviewed ? The truth is , you won 't be writing any more books , Mr. Hicks . My journal , please . This interview is over . You just ruined a perfectly good jacket . Get your hands in the air ! Hold on , hold on ! - Put the shovel down ! - There 's a guy and a gun ! - Put the shovel down ! - On the ground ! Now ! - It 's my house ! - On the ground ! - It 's my house ! There 's a man inside ! - On the ground , sir ! - There 's a man in there with a gun ! - Up against the wall . - There 's a man and a gun . - Now ! Now ! Move it ! Move it ! Just relax . - There 's a guy inside . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Clear ! Bedroom clear . Bathroom clear . Louis Hall , architect , Louis Barnes , sales representative , Louis Hayes , Community Brotherhood Project . You 're a man of many faces . I 'm an investigative reporter . An investigative reporter . And you recognized him ? It 's the same guy . This accurately matches your description ? That 's him . That 's definitely him . Fine . Circulate it . Okay , so , your door was locked , no sign of forced entry . How 'd he get in ? I don 't know . I see . And you say he came in here looking for a journal , his journal ? Yes . Which you should 've turned in . And you obviously know that withholding evidence is a crime . All right . Let me get this straight . A killer , who only you saw , breaks in here , steals the only proof you have of his existence . You think I made this up ? I broke my own window ? I put these cuts on my face ? A security guard at the Federal Building saw Felicia arguing with a man after work . Would that be you ? Yes . What were you fighting about ? Am I a suspect here ? I don 't know . You tell me . I mean , at 6 : 00 , you two were fighting , and at midnight , she 's dead . Listen to me . He plans to kill again . More people are gonna die , a lot more . I mean , I saw names , dates , surveillance photos . I mean , we got to figure out a way to stop this guy . " We " ? " We " got to figure it out ? It 's not enough for you to write about these nut jobs ? You got to get in on the action , huh ? I just don 't want to see any more people hurt . But don 't you ? I mean , doesn 't that make for a better book ? I mean , it 's a hell of a career comeback . The Killer Who Can 't Be Caught / Personal Interviews by Louis Hicks . Get out of my house . Spoken like a truly innocent man . Hey ! Geez . Look how big he is . - How old is he now ? What , six ? - Seven in a few weeks . They grow up before you know it . You don 't know the half of it . You get anything off that fingerprint ? Yeah . One hit . Nothing very useful . " James Keech , Caucasian male , height , 4 ' 7 " , " residence , Trinity Home for Boys , no known family , age 11 . " Yeah . He 's a kid popped up on the state welfare database . - Yeah . - An orphan in some group home up in Brooksville . Not your guy , huh ? About 30 years too young . I don 't get it . It doesn 't make sense . I know how you feel . I 'm sorry about Felicia . What 's your point ? You need to stay away from this , Louis . You 're too close to it . Becker 's really got it in for you . And when he kills again ? He 's planning two more victims in the next three days . We 're on it . Let Becker do his job . Right . ' Cause he 's just so good at it . I got to go . I 'm just trying to help . Thanks anyway , Gordo . Shit . Victoria Ihling . April 19th . Anne Brighton . April 22nd . Felicia . Felicia Carson . Anne Brighton . Vicki Ihling . What do you have in common ? - Hello ? Hey ! - Kayla , Louis Hicks . Listen , you still doing DNA matches for Uncle Sam ? Yeah . I 'm doing another story . I might need a favor . Anytime . Great . Thanks . - Jax ! Louis Hicks . - Hey , man . I might need you to run some names for me . You got to help me , Louis . Listen , I 'll tail him for a few days , and I 'll get some pictures taken . Son of a bitch ! I know it ! I know she 's cheating on me ! I know , I know . We 'll take care of it , buddy . Listen , you got something for me ? Yeah , right . Okay . One of these is the needle in the proverbial haystack . There 's over 30 Anne Brightons in the metro area alone . But Victoria Ihling , there 's just two hits . One of them deceased , and the other one , God bless her , is one of those who likes to spread her life all over the Web . I mean , these women , they put it out there for everyone to see and then they complain about stalkers , you know ? What do I know ? You did good , buddy . You did good . Anytime . Anytime , Hicks . But you owe me one . Yes . Hi . Vicki Ihling , please ? Louis Hicks with the Journal . Yes , and I 'm writing an exposé on animal rights abuses in the food industry . Yes , ma 'am . I wanted to ask you a couple of questions . I will see you later . Miss Ihling . - May I help you ? - Louis Hicks . We spoke on the phone this morning . How did you know where I work ? Sorry . Your webpage . I 'm a reporter . I 'm on a deadline . I just had a few more questions . You know what ? I 'm in kind of a rush . It 'll only take you a couple minutes . Can I buy you a cup of coffee or ... You know what ? Why don 't you give me your card , and I 'll call you ? Better yet , I 'll call you . - Tomorrow morning fine ? - It 's fine . Bye . - Sorry to have bothered you . - Okay , thanks . Have a good day . You , too . No , come on . No , no , no , no , no . No , no , no , no . Come on . Please don 't . Please . Come on . No . Come on . No . No . - Everything all right ? - It 's fine . Fine , thanks . Doesn 't sound fine . Piece of cake . - There you go . You 're all set . - I don 't know how to thank you . I do . Dinner tonight . And you 're buying . On a teacher 's salary ? I don 't think so . I guess it 's on me then . All right , that 's more like it . Anne Brighton , please . Deceased ? Sorry for your loss . Hello . May I speak to Anne Brighton , please ? I see . Did she leave a forwarding address ? - Hello ? - Hi . Is Vicki home ? You must be Louis . I 'm Shelly , her roommate . Nice to meet you . Sorry . Vicki 's not here . She 's not ? No . She told me to tell you that she 's sorry , but she couldn 't make it . Why is that ? Tell you the truth , she 's very insecure . She panicked . She got nervous about going out with a guy she just met . Well , can you at least tell me where she went ? She 's gonna kill me . The Griffin Room . It 's about eight blocks that way . You turn left on 3rd . Hey ! Hey , wait ! - Hey , there . - How you doing ? I 'll have a ... I 'll have what the lady 's having . You got it . Hi . - Is this seat taken ? - It is now . It is a crime how we treat our teachers . So , where do you teach ? Washington Elementary . Really ? I knew someone there . - A teacher ? - No , a student , actually . - A little boy . - Who ? A little orphan boy . He played a bit rough with a stray cat . Teacher told on him . Sent him back to his group home . Yeah . He didn 't much like it there . Hey , you all right ? I have to go to the restroom . Excuse me . - Hey ! - Hey ! It was a mangy , old stray . No one was going to miss it . It was a fucking cat ! No . No . God , please . You 're too late . He 's got a gun ! Look , I can 't talk right now . I got a whack job with a gun down at the Griffin . Gordo ! It 's me ! I know who the hell it is . I can 't talk right now . I got to go . No , no , Gordo , no ! It 's me they saw with the gun ! I tried to stop him ! What are you talk ... What ? Who ? Who ? The same guy that killed Felicia . I tried ... He murdered again ! He 's gonna kill another one in 48 hours . Louis , where are you ? I ... I ... I can 't stop him . Every time I try , he just disappears . Where are you ? I 'm gonna come get you . I can 't come in ! I can 't ! They won 't believe me ! Louis ! If you run , I can 't help you ! Louis ! Damn it ! Hicks , police ! Come on out ! Hicks ! - Bedroom clear ! - Clear ! - Clear ! - Clear ! To the right ! Backyard clear . Nobody home . No , he 's not crazy at all . He 'll claim he was tracking the killer , re-creating his diary . Jesus Christ . Could there be more ? Other unsolveds ? You know , Hicks warned that there would be other killings . I 'm on it . Hey , Marty . Louis Hicks . Hey , buddy . Remember that thing I kept your name out of ? Yeah . You said to call if I ever needed to borrow one . Four door okay ? Brother , as long as it 's got four wheels , I 'm good . In local news , a woman was brutally murdered in the Griffin Room bar downtown . Eyewitnesses report seeing an armed man flee the premises on foot . Police are urging anyone with information leading to the capture and arrest of the suspect to call the urgent ... - Hello ? - Hey , Hicks ? Kayla Pierce . Hey . I ran the DNA sample . And ? And the blood on the cloth and the blood off the kid 's prints , they 're an exact match . What kid ? Right . It 's an exact match ? Are you sure ? Well , as far as I can tell . Could a father and son have the same DNA ? Well , all men have a copy of their father 's Y chromosome , but this is more than that . I mean , this looks like the same person . Or I guess it could be a twin , but it would have to be an identical twin . I mean , a fraternal twin wouldn 't do . Is there room for error ? There always is . It 's not a perfect science . I mean , normally , DNA are compared at only a few spots along the sample . I could run more tests . That 'd be great , Kayla . I owe you one . You owe me a lot more than that , handsome . See you . Trinity Home for Boys . Now move on ! Go ! - May I help you ? - I sure hope so . They said to speak to Polly , second office on the left . Come in . Hi . I 'm Polly , the overworked and underpaid social worker . Louis Hayes . I 'm with the Community Brotherhood Project . - Mr. Hayes , have a seat , please . - Thank you . I 'm here on behalf of one of your kids . James Keech ? Why is that ? Well , we run a corporately sponsored Big Brother outreach program . James ' name came up as a possible candidate . James ? Really ? You seem surprised . Perhaps someone applied on his behalf ? No . No living family . Where did you say you worked again ? Community Brotherhood Project . Part of the mayor 's new joint-outreach initiative . Right . Yeah , I 've heard of that . Don 't you think James could benefit from some guidance ? Yes , of course . He 's a very bright kid . Aptitude scores , especially in math . Well , when he cares enough to apply himself . It 's just ... I 'm not sure that he 's ready . His social skills aren 't terrific . He can be a handful . I think there are other kids that would be much more suitable ... Well , it sounds to me like ... this is the one kid that would benefit most from our mentoring . May I take a look at his file ? You know , it 's just words on paper . Come with me . I have to warn you , he 's been returned by every foster family we 've managed to place him with . And he 's getting to that age where , well , let 's face it , even the best of them get less adorable as they get older . Let 's just try and stay positive . See if the kid 's not due for a change of luck . I like your attitude . I wish the rest of my colleagues thought that way . - You wait here . I 'll go get him . - Of course . James ? There 's a gentleman here from the Community Brotherhood ... Come on . He 's very nice . - James , this is Mr. Hayes . - You could call me Louis . James , Mr. Hayes is our guest . Hi . Can you give me a moment alone with him , please ? Sure . I 'll be right over there . Hey , buddy , how old are you ? What the fuck you want , mister ? - Well , I asked to meet you . - What for ? Well , I run a Big Brother program . We go to group homes , take kids on trips . You know , stuff like that . - Why ? - Just for fun . Is there anything special you 'd like to do ? Really ? Try me . It 's what he wants . And how am I going to gain the boy 's trust if I can 't deliver ? Look , Mr. Hayes , I have to ask . Why this child ? Well , couldn 't you ask that of any one of them ? That 's a good point , but he 's had a very tragic childhood . Both his aunt and mother were murdered four years apart . - How ? - Horribly . His mother was torn apart . Dissected and left in a bathtub . The police found him , a baby , in the apartment with her . He had been there for hours with the body . If someone hadn 't called in an anonymous tip , he might not ever have survived . - They ever catch the killer ? - Not as far as I know . James went to live with an aunt . It was a less than ideal situation . Drugs , domestic abuse . He went into foster care , and right after , the boyfriend killed the aunt and killed himself . - Some sort of murder-suicide thing . - And the father ? There is no father . Take a look for yourself . The lot across the street had a camera . - You see anyone else ? - No . There were witnesses outside . Nothing landed but the window he shot out . Bartender said he saw her talking to another guy . Okay , then find me that guy . Because right now , the only guy is right there . And guess what ? The last victim was dissected . Same MO as his ex-girlfriend . Do you think that 's a coincidence ? No , but I think you 're being a little too personal on this one , Ed . Come on , it 's Hicks . I know the guy . He 's not a killer . Fine . Let 's just get your boyfriend off the streets , so he doesn 't get himself into more trouble . Yes , may I speak to Anne Brighton , please ? My condolences . Sorry to have bothered you . They 're beautiful , aren 't they ? They 're killers . No one 's gonna want to mess with them . I guess not . What do you want to be when you grow up , James ? I don 't know . - Astronaut . - Really ? That 's cool . Are you angry at somebody , James ? I get angry , too , sometimes . Hell , I might even want to get even with the person who made me angry . Yeah , I could hurt them really bad . You could , but then you 'd be as bad as they are . I bet if some guy were trying to kill you , you 'd kill him first . Protect my family . Yeah , I guess I would . Yeah . I probably won 't be an astronaut . Don 't say that , James . You could be anything you wanna be . - I 'm really good at math . - See ? There you go . You could be a scientist or a programmer , an inventor , even . Yeah , right . Like I 'll have a chance . I live in a fucking group-home orphanage , remember ? - Come on , man . Don 't say that . - It 's true . You want me to lie ? No , I don 't . The penguins like it better when I lie . - The penguins ? - Stupid nuns . " No , Sister , I didn 't break the window . ' ' " Yes , Sister , I did my homework . ' ' They 're just ... James , let me ask you something . You ever seen this man before ? - No . - Are you sure ? - You really think I could be an inventor ? - Of course I do . I could build a space ship that travels really fast . Like , faster than the speed of light . So fast that it gets to where it 's going before it ever left in the first place , ending up in the past . - A time machine . - Yeah . Yeah . I could go back to the past , fix my life . What do you mean , fix your life ? No , I feel like such a ball head . I don 't know if that goes there or not . So , how did it go ? It was all right . - Louis is pretty cool . - Pretty cool . Thanks . You 're welcome , James . It was nice hanging out with you . All right , James , time for dinner . No , I want to show Louis something . Come on . This your bed ? So , you wanted to show me something ? I don 't know . I 've never shown this to anyone . It 's secret . But we 're friends , right ? Yes . Yes , we are . Promise not to tell anyone . Especially the penguins . Okay . Cross your heart and hope to die . I do . Cross my heart ... Cross my heart and hope to die . ... and hope to die . Okay . The reason I wanted to go to the zoo is because I make my own zoos . They 're personal and private to me , but I 'll show you them if you promise you 'll come back and visit . Okay , I promise . You 're too late . I made it myself . No one helped me . James , these animals are dead . You hurt them . You don 't understand . I made this myself . Forget it ! I knew I shouldn 't have shown you ! I knew it ! No , I 'm glad you showed me . It 's just ... Get out of here ! Get out of here ! I hate you ! Why 'd you come ? You 're not my friend ! No , I am your friend . It 's just , sometimes , friends have to say things that are difficult to hear . Fuck you ! Fuck you , fucker ! I hate you ! - What 's wrong ? What 's going on ? - He tried to hurt me ! - He tried to touch me ! - No . No , I ... He tried to touch me here , like my other parents did . - No . No , I didn 't . - Make him leave ! I know . This is just something he says because he gets attention for saying it . Now I really think you should go . Do you know what he has in there ? You promised ! You swore ! Hope to die ! Hope to die ! No , I 'm sorry , James . I 'm sorry . - You should go . - I 'm sorry . It 's okay . It 's okay . - Kayla ? - I ran more tests . - And ? - I got the lab to myself , but only for the next hour . You 've got to see this . It 's insane . I 'm on my way . Well , the tests were consistent . The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me . - So it 's the same person ? - Absolutely . But here 's the crazy thing . It 's the cloth itself . I 've never seen a weave structure like this before . You should take a look . Here , that 's the sample you gave me . Go ahead . Okay , I can see it . Now watch this . When I apply the heat lamp , the strands actually expand . And when I take it away , they contract . Cloth that reacts to temperature . Is that military ? I have no idea . But whoever invented this could make a fortune . Unless it hasn 't been invented yet . I could build a space ship . Ending up in the past . A time machine . Thanks , Kayla . Well , the tests were consistent . The DNA and the bloody fingerprint matches the blood on the cloth you gave me . - So it 's the same person ? - Absolutely . I could go back to the past , fix my life . Why are you doing this ? I 'm just putting things right . Oh , shit ! This is Gordon . It 's me , Gordo . Where the fuck are you ? Man , it doesn 't matter . What matters is that I figured it out . It 's pretty insane , but I figured it out , Gordo . Yeah . Right , right . Are you okay ? What if you thought a little boy was a killer ? What are you talking about ? We thought the fingerprint from the journal was the killer 's . It 's not . It 's the kid 's . It matches because the kid is the killer . The killer 's DNA matches the kid 's exactly . The guy wears cloth that hasn 't been invented yet . And the piece of paper from his journal , well , it 's dated 20 years from now . It all makes sense . That 's why he 's always one step ahead of me . It 's the kid 's older self . Do you get it ? He 's traveling through time , and he 's gonna kill again tomorrow , Gordo . - You hear me ? - Yeah . - He 's gonna kill again . - Louis . Louis , you know I 'm here for you , right , pal ? I will always be here for you . You son of a bitch . What ? Tracing the call . You son of a ... Louis , Louis ! You got it ? Not an exact pinpoint , but we got the general area . He 's 20 to 50 miles up north on Route 14 . Let 's go . Everyone , come on , get out there . Let 's go . Fuck . Hi . Sorry , but you 're listed , and I needed to talk . Of course . You 've had a hell of a day . He 's a very troubled boy . Don 't fool yourself . - Can I offer you a drink ? - Yes , please . Do you think people are born evil , or does the world make them that way ? That 's a big question . I think people are basically good . Evil 's an accident . An error . An error of growing up that causes people to make the wrong choices for what they think are the right reasons . So , you don 't think people intend evil ? No . I 've seen too many kids . They wanna be good . Then life just doesn 't work a certain way , and wrong choices have a way of multiplying . Even Hitler didn 't think he was evil . He thought he was saving the world . Manson , too , in his own way . But what if you could kill Manson or Hitler when he 's still a child ? No way . They 're children . They 're not Hitler or Manson . Not yet , no . You 're talking about James . He 's had a troubled life , but there 's hope for him . - He 's just a child . - People are dead because of him . - Who ? James ? - And more people are gonna die . - What are you talking about ? - What 's your name ? What ? - Your name . What 's your name ? - Polly . Anne . Anne is my birth name , but because of my sunny disposition , my friends called me Pollyanna . Polly for short . It 's a nickname that sort of stuck . What is going on ? Why are you carrying a gun ? Anne Brighton . I have to stop this . I 'm sorry . Please don 't go anywhere . It 's not safe . I have to ... Freeze ! Police ! - Wait ! Wait , wait ! - Get down ! Get down ! He 's gonna kill Polly . - Down ! Down ! On the ground , now ! - Gordo ! Wait , wait ! He 's gonna kill Polly . Anne Brighton ! He 's gonna kill Polly . - Get down ! Now ! - Anne Brighton , she 's next on the list ! Gun . Gun ! You don 't understand ! I 'm trying to save her life ! She 's the one who called us . Said you were acting all crazy , threatening a child . - You don 't understand ! - Louis , Louis , calm down . Louis Hicks , you have the right to remain silent . - Gordo , listen to me ! - Anything you say ... Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Listen to me , Gordo ! The boy and the killer are the same ! - You have the right to talk to a lawyer ... - The boy and the killer are the same ! - While being present ! - The boy and the killer are the same ! Louis ... Copy that . I 'll tell her . Okay , miss , you can relax . We have him in custody . Thank you . That 's great . - Good night . - Good night . Call me if you need me . - All right . - All right . You betrayed me , Anne . Polly . Anne . Whatever your name is . You don 't know it yet , but you 're about to betray the boy . And I can 't let you do that . I 'm sorry . You were like a mother to me . - Time travel ? - Those things he said . " You 'll never write another book . " " I 'm making things right . " He had a revenge fantasy as a child , and now he 's making it happen . Listen , his next victim , Anne Brighton , is April 22nd , today . And you think this because an 11-year-old told you he wants to make a time machine . Check the date on the article . It 's more than 20 years from now . Come on . My kid can make that on her laptop in five minutes . There 's a cloth from his jacket that hasn 't even been invented yet . - Where is it ? - Listen to me ! You 're not listening to me ! Listen to me ! Everyone connected to him is dead . Felicia was the DA on his custody case . Vicki Ihling was the teacher that returned him to the orphanage . The boy ... The boy is the only thing they both had in common . They also had you in common . Your lawyer 's here . Detective , I 'd like a private conference with my client . Sure . Thank you . Did you mean it ? When you said , " Cross my heart and hope to die " ? I thought we were friends . We went to the zoo together . That wasn 't so long ago , was it ? Now I 'm all grown up . And I get to fix the world , my world . To make it a better place for that boy . That boy who never meant to hurt anyone , that boy who just wanted a chance . A chance , a chance , a chance . Random counter , root applied to ... You 're insane . Time travel is complex . You have no idea how complex . I have to choose the exact moment in time to end someone 's lifespan so the ripple effect has the specific impact I want it to have . Do you know the sheer number of calculations necessary ? It would blow your mind . I thought we were friends . Why are you doing this to me ? To you ? You don 't get it , do you ? You promised that you 'd come back for me . You never did . I waited and waited for months . Do you know how long a month is for a little boy waiting for his hero to return ? - I 'm sorry , James . - Don 't you fucking call me that . I ran away from that shit-hole orphanage . I lived on the streets until I was old enough to lie my way into joining the army . They 've taught me how to kill in so many different ways . Then they sent me to school . Turns out I had a real facility for math . Worked on some classified shit . You gave me that idea , you know ? You told me , " You can be anything you choose . An inventor , even . ' ' Hey . You wanna see it ? I made it portable . Nanotechnology . Are you proud of me ? Time to go . - Wait . - Bye-bye . - Wait ! - Okay . See , you don 't get it . Every move you make , I 've already planned for . Oh , no . I probably should have warned you about that . The first jump really messes with your insides . I remember my first jump . It was a sweaty , filthy evening 11 years ago . I cut her heart out . Dear Mom . Rest her soul . I paid her back in advance for a lifetime of misery . She was the definition of shitty mom . Addict , fondler . Killing her didn 't solve anything , and they then sent me to live with Aunt Carol , who made my crack-whore mommy look like a saint . So , I offed her , too . But I couldn 't stop there . You see , every time I fixed something , something else needed to be fixed . Time doesn 't like to be messed with . But that 's when I figured it out . You 're the problem . Each time I revisited this week in my life , you were always there to mess things up , so this time , I made you part of the solution . The future , in black and white . You see , you bring the boy here , and he becomes a hero . See , I never had a chance . You 're his chance , his only chance . My chance . Now , go get him . He trusts you . Not sold ? Okay . If you don 't bring the boy back here in 15 minutes , I 'm gonna gut her and make her eat her own intestines . You 'd better hurry . No . No ! No , no , no , no , no . What do you mean you never saw them leave ? What the fuck did they do ? Beam up to the mother ship ? Like I said , when I came in the room , they were gone . Gone ? They Houdini 'd out of here , right ? That 's what I 'm supposed to believe ? That 's bullshit ! It just doesn 't happen ! The social worker , she was on the list , right ? - She 's next ? - Yeah . But he kept talking about the boy , so he might have headed back to the orphanage . Okay . Okay . I 'll take a team there . You take Maddox and go check on that girl . - Louis ? - Hey , James . What are you doing here ? I came back for you . Yeah ? I 'm gonna get you out of here . Okay , come on . Okay , buddy , get your shoes on . Okay , go , go . Go , go , go . I 'm sorry I 'm not what you thought the future would look like . Listen to me . I need you to stay in here . - Why ? - Just trust me , please . Where 's the boy ? You let her go and I 'll tell you . Promise ? Cross your heart and hope to die ? Yes . Now let her go . Hey , kid , it 's good to see you . Who is he ? My name is James , too . Same as you . James Keech . - Are you my dad ? - No . I 'm you , James , from the future . You know how you wanted to go back in time and fix things ? Well , you did it . I 'm you , just older . - We 're the same . - No , you 're not , James . - You 'll never be him . - Don 't listen to him . Listen to me . - To us . - Are you gonna hurt her ? But she 's always been so good to me . But you don 't know the future . I do . In a few days , she 's gonna find your private zoo , and they 're gonna lock you away with crazy people . They will do unspeakable things to you . They will burn you , and cut you , and worse . And I am not gonna let them do that to you . Don 't look at him . He 's not your friend . Go ahead , kill me . Nothing changes . He still becomes me . But if he kills you , he becomes a hero . Welcome to the future . What 's happening ? What 's ... James ? James ! James ! I 'm so sorry , James . I 'm sorry , James . I 'm so sorry . I don 't know why I remember , but I do . Keech was right . Time travel is complex . The one thing he could never predict was his own death . When his younger self died , reality itself was realigned . I woke up in a new world , a world where the killer never came to be . Where his victims lived their lives never knowing how close they 'd come to their own demise . In this new world , those terrible few days never happened . In this world , a troubled boy never became a killer . He got a second chance . Then again , so did I. Daddy ! Daddy ! You 're home ! I missed you , buddy . I 'm taking the teaching job . Welcome home .

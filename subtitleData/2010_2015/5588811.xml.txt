 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... For a second there , you were a lot like my big sister . Where does she live ? What does she do ? - Details ! - Well , she died a while back . If you do this , anyone you tell will be in grave danger . I figured it out . Whenever I get hurt- - - Ow ! Oh , they got me ! - Claudia feels the pain . Now , you and I both know that taking myself off the metronome might be the only way to keep Claudia safe . I want you to find a certain artifact before it finds me . But what does- - what does Brother Adrian want ? - It 's none of your business . - Actually , dude made it our business when he unleashed crazy Alice and Fisher 's marbles - back into the world . - Yeah , and when he almost - buried Steve and Claudia alive . - Which is why I don 't wanna put any of you in any more danger . Additionally , we have a ping . One Leonard Bukowski . He checked into a hospital in Dalton , West Virginia . He had a rust-like rash covering his face and arm , coughing up blood , and particles - of iron oxide . - Rusting , huh ? Huh , maybe a witch left him out in the rain . Or--or--or this is really serious - and I should stop making jokes . - Yeah , there 's a thought . All right , a little light reading for the plane . No-no-no , no ! I see what you 're doing , Artie . - We need to talk- - - A man is rusting in West Virginia . You have lives to save . Go ! You know , one of these days , there won 't be a ping , and you 'll actually have to tell us things . Oh , darn , that was last Tuesday . - Uh- - - Go ! Go , go , go ! Go ! So , let 's talk Brother Adrian . - Oh , dear God help me . - What exactly does this brother want you to do ? Convert ? Don 't shave your head . That 's not a good look for you . You either . Besides , you 've got way bigger - fish to fry . - Like ? Like getting Steve off Maelzel 's metronome . Oh , you keep the metronome in there . Yes . Uh , one of the descendants of Robert Schumann the composer , he confirms that Schumann owned - the metronome in the 1830s . - Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa . Can you hang on a sec , Siri ? Do we even know the risks of doing this , be--before we try any wacky plans ? I thought that you wanted this , too . Yeah , I want the version where you don 't die again . What 's the big rush ? - Dyahh ! Okay , made your point . - Yes . Uh , Schumann tried to kill himself in 1833 , but Clara Wieck- - fiancee- - she kept him alive via the metronome , which , sadly , also drove him insane . - Super . - Yes , in 1839 , Schumann got free of the metronome , and he wrote : " To live free of this heart , " one must first find one 's own ; and make a pure start , from whence one comes . " From whence one comes ? New Jersey ? It 's probably where you were born . - You were born at home , right ? - See ? It 's a riddle . Go solve it ! - There has to be another way . - There isn 't . Go ! Fly ! Be free , before you go insane like Schumann . Hello , Arthur . Very clever . I barely even saw the screen . Now , let 's talk about Brother Adrian . I--I--I don 't know what HG may have told you- - About Brother Adrian ? Or you using Magellan 's Astrolabe to turn back time ? Ever since Mr. Sykes tried to destroy the Warehouse , I 've known that something had altered time . And that something appears to be you . Arthur , how could you take such a risk with so formidable an artifact ? I had no choice ! The Warehouse was gone . You were gone . You too , HG . You saved Pete , you saved Myka and me , but you were killed . That 's why you pled to the Regents on my behalf . - And the ytterbium chamber- - - Was destroyed . - Pandora 's box ? - Gone . - What about hope ? - All gone ! - Did I do wrong ? - No . I would 've done the same . But Arthur , - what are the repercussions ? - He said that I would be creating an evil of my own making that I would have to live with for the rest of my days . 4x08 - Second Chance - Mr. Bukowski , when did all this start ? Last night , I guess . I started coughing - as I left the mill . - The Siskel Steel Mill . Oh , that 's right . I read the file . So you work over there , or- - Me and every other mook south of 50 in Dalton , yes . Is that where you got sick ? Docs have been runnin ' tests . Everything 's negative . They won 't even let me out for the fights tonight . Right . Uh , Lenny- - have you received any old-timey - tools or--or equipment lately ? - No . - What about enemies ? - Enemies , no ! People like me ! The only person I ever hated who hates me right back is Hank Siskel . Oh , the owner of the mill . Why ? He 's been withholding paychecks for weeks . He just laid off 30 guys . Says he 's bankrupt , which is bull , so we push back ! Start talking to the press , picketing . We 're just trying to save our jobs- - Sorry . He really should rest now . Mr. Bukowski , thank you for your time . Uh , would you call me if there 's any change ? So ... this is Jinksyland , huh ? Oh , look at that . I totally see you all sporty teen out here , - shootin ' hoops with dad ! - Mom , actually . This is a bad idea . No , Steve , come on ! We 're here . Do you wanna tell me why you don 't wanna go in there so bad , before we actually - go in there ? - Look , my mom and I , we- we had a fight . - About the gay thing ? What ? No-no-no , she doesn 't care about that . This is New Jersey , not North Carolina . - Okay , then , what ? - Can we just do this and go home ? Yeah , okay , sure . Let 's meet evil mom . Steven . Hi , mom . Oh , thank goodness you 're here ! Ma ! Mom , ma , ma . This is my friend Claudia . - Hi . - Nice to meet you , Mrs. Jinks . Wonderful to meet you , too . Welcome ! I 'm so happy to see you both ! Come on in ! Come on in . Wow , what a nightmare for you . Hell , no , we won 't go ! We want jobs , we won 't go ! Hell , no , we won 't go ! We want jobs , we won 't go ! Hell , no , we won 't go ! We want jobs , we won 't go ! Hell , no , we won 't go- - Let 's go , sheriff . I gotta get in . Okay , so these places are toxic . - Cancer , asbestos , black lung . - Yeah , but nothing - that makes you rust . - Get outta my way ! Move it ! Hey--hey--hey--hey ! Break it up , break it up ! Break it up , break it up ! Somebody 's working today , jerk . Who the hell are you ? Agents Lattimer and Bering , Secret Service . Oh , great . The feds are finally coming after Siskel . Nah--nah , we 're not here for him . We 're trying to find out what happened to Lenny Bukowski . Yeah ? Well , you could put that on Siskel , too . I 'm Sam Garity , union rep here . - Excuse me . - First , the gantry " accidentally " breaks , and the foreman nearly gets - killed trying to fix it . - Yeah , right after we filed - a complaint . - Yeah . Then , Lenny gets sick . And now Siskel 's threatening to shut down the mill ? - Mykes . - Yeah ? That was Lenny 's doctor . He said his lung tissue 's so bad , they had to remove a large part of it . Oh , my God ! Pete ! Call an ambulance ! I don 't know . It 's pretty gnarly , Artie . This guy 's arm 's all cracking and orange , kinda like an old car at the beach . You have any leads on the artifact ? No , no , not really . This guy Siskel , the owner of the mill , his steel workers are sure he 's behind it all . - But , uh , they have no proof . - Rather idiotic , isn 't it ? Causing an accident at his own mill ? And then calling attention to yourself - by making your workers sick . - Yeah , except according to the sheriff , he--he 's broken up two fights in three days . The first time , uh , Siskel went up against Lenny Bukowski , and today , it was Tim . Both of them wound up in the hospital . I--I think that 's pretty suspicious . Yeah . You know , that seems suspicious . - I just said that . - Yes , I know . I was just confirming it . Look , I don 't have very much on Siskel , because I 've been distracted . But I can tell you that he changed his name from Hank Blaloc to Hank Siskel in 2001 . Oh , wow . - That 's pretty sketch-ball . - Indeed . Sketch-ball--sketch-ball ! What 'd be the etymology - of a phrase- - - Arthur 's very busy . - Oh ! Hello . - Mrs. Frederic ? You 're grown agents , handle it ! - You 're stalling . - No , I am not ! I 'm--we 're--where was I ? Creating an evil of your own making . What exactly is this evil ? I--I- - Arthur , I know you have theories . Actually , I don 't . All I have is- - uh , I have a feeling . - I 'm guessing a bad feeling . - Yes , it makes me nauseous . But it 's all I have . A feeling that the evil is- it may be Claudia . - Claudia ? - What makes you think this ? - It 's a nightmare . Technically , it 's a vision . She 's coming at me with a dagger , and then she stabs me with it . The dagger you tasked me to find ? Yes , I wanted you to find it , so that she wouldn 't . You 're mistaken , trust me . If you 'd created an evil in Claudia , I 'd know it . All right . Then what is it ? What 's the evil ? Have you considered the man who 's been bringing artifacts back into the world ? The one who 's trying to kill the people you care about . That this Brother Adrian is the evil ? Yeah . Oh , that is definitely the smell . It 's acai mate tea from Peru . Steven and I used to drink this almost every day . Oh , he still does , as a matter of fact . Otherwise , he gets very , very cranky . Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's just that something you said was so- - so reminded me of my- - Mom . Thanks for the tea . Well , um , I 'm just glad that you have such nice friends . So , I don 't even know . Are you , uh--are you still - at the ATF ? - Yep . Told ya , - nothing 's changed . - And you 're still living - in New Jersey ? - Well , no , not really . All right . So , ah--you know what ? I can come visit you anywhere . I love to travel- - You can 't . It 's complicated . All right . Steven , it has been two years . I am still your mother , and I love you . When are we gonna talk about it ? We 're not , ma . Right now , we just need to do something here , in the house , and then we 'll get out of your hair . Well , this is your house , too . And for the record , I don 't want you out of my hair . But it makes sense . He wanted you to lie . He wants you isolated and vulnerable . - Yet for what purpose ? - All I know is that he wants me to use the Astrolabe again . He wants me to undo that day that I altered . But it 's something that I ... I can 't do . I can 't--I won 't do it . I assume the Astrolabe is safe ? Yes , of course it is . It 's safe . But if Brother Adrian is the evil , then why am I having these visions about Claudia ? Arthur , Croatia , Vienna , Stuttgart . You and I both know how easy it is to implant a subconscious thought . Yes , of course , you 're right . Yeah , and I suppose that anyone who 's ever raised a teenager can imagine being murdered by them . I 'll take this up with the Regents . We may be able to reach out to the brotherhood through other channels . This is not how I wanted to handle this , and you know it . - Artie- - - I trusted you- - I 'm sorry- - I 'm trying to help you ! Nobody understands the perils of time travel artifacts like I do ! I 've already lost two agents because of them . I won 't lose you , too . I hope you 're right . But there 's no turning back now . Hello ! I 'm Agent Bering . I 'm here to talk to Hank Siskel ? Thank you ! Mr. Siskel , there 's a lady cop here to see you . Thank you . Pete , you are in the clear . Hi , I 'm Agent Bering . I 'm with the Secret Service . I 'm here investigating Lenny Bukowski 's and Tim Watts ' illnesses . Yeah , yeah , I saw you earlier . Now , Lenny and Tim . It 's an awful thing . I 'm real close to my guys . Yeah , like India and Pakistan . Really ? Because I heard a rumor that you actually made them sick . I made them sick ? Jeez , talk about ungrateful . Look , in this economy , I 'm drowning here just keeping the lights on . Get down off the cross . We need the wood ! Your sign 's , uh , incorrect . Didn 't your foreman have an accident here last week ? His crew thinks that you set it up because he lodged a complaint . But then again , in this economy , maybe you needed the extra insurance money . - Come again ? - Go , Mykes ! You ... are ... the ... 99 % ! Is that why the Secret Service is here ? But you 're gonna need a confession , 'cause I 'm finding zilch . Look , accidents happen all the time , and it 's always " Blame the company . " Let me tell you something , lady . I 'm fed up with this . I 'm calling my attorneys . Where 'd you get that belt buckle ? - What ? - Your belt buckle . - Where 'd you get it ? - My buckle ? What ? Forget it , Mykes . He 's not the guy . Okay . You know what ? Never mind . Thank you so much . I will be in touch . Pete , what the hell is going on ? We just got a call from the hospital . There 's a third rusting victim . A woman . - What , another steel worker ? - No , that 's the rub . This one 's never been to the mill . So ... Here we are from whence I came . - What next ? - Uh , I--not a clue . I would just like to say this out loud again , that we have no idea what the fallout might be . Look , I can 't live every minute of every day worrying about hurting you . We need to do this . Yeah , I know , okay . Um , so put your hand here . And then , I--I 'm supposed to focus on you , which is much easier with you not dead . So ... is that it ? Did--did it work ? Uh ... " To live free of this heart , one must find one 's own ; And make a pure start , from whence one comes . " Did we not just do that ? Only one way to find out . Ste- - Steven ! What was that ? Oh , my God ! Steven , what 's happening ? Get up ! Get up , Steven ! Steven ! Oh , what 's happening to you ? That did not work . - Steven , talk to me . - We are never getting off this thing . I came here for nothing ! Steve ! Please , tell me what 's happening . Talk to me . Ms. Miller , when did all this start ? Just this morning . I thought it was an allergy at first . And you 've never met Hank Siskel or been to the steel mill ? Uh , am I going to be okay ? Yes . Um , just excuse me for a second . - Hi . - Hey . So doc says Lenny 's going downhill fast and says Tim 's not much better . There has to be a connection between the three of them , Pete . Karen , hi . Um , have you ever met Lenny Bukowski or--or Tim Watts ? Well , I--I don 't think so . Are--are they sick , too ? Uh--is this some kind of an outbreak ? Tully 's . Uh , Ms. Miller , - do you work out at Tully 's gym ? - Yeah , I do a little boxing . Do any of the guys from the steel mill box there , too ? Well , sure , a bunch of ' em . - Thank you . - Yeah . It 's , like , 200 degrees in here , - and it smells like your room . - Ah , light a match . The owner says that Hank Siskel wouldn 't be caught dead in here . And now , I can see why . What are you two doing here ? Well , it turns out Siskel may not be the one making your friends sick after all . - What makes you say that ? - Another victim . This one 's never been to the mill - but boxes here with you guys . - W--wait a minute . So you 're trying to say there could be something - here at Tully 's ? - Hey , there 's nothing wrong with my gym . I use bleach . That 's just Siskel trying to hit us where it hurts . The fights here give people in this town something to cheer for . Of course he 'd wanna shut them down . You think he 's that diabolical ? Everyone does ! Standing up to him keeps us strong . You wanna take that away from us ? - Whose side are you on , anyway ? - I 'm not on anybody 's side . You should be on the side of the workers . All right , all right . Wanna fight ? Take it in the ring- - otherwise , let 's break this up . - So are you thinking- - - Sam Garity 's our guy ? He 's certainly more interested in the cause than the truth . Enough to maybe use an artifact to--to make - Hank Siskel look bad ? - Mykes , we gotta talk to these guys one-on-one before Tim and Lenny run out of time . How are we gonna do that ? A little hands-on interrogation . Hey , fool ! What 's my prediction for the fight ? Pain ! Ooh ! Oh , oh , oh ! Okay , all right . So , uh , you ever see anyone around here using anything I don 't know ... unusual ? You know , like , uh , I don 't know , - Sam Garity ? - What about him ? He 's--he 's pretty intense , isn 't he ? - What do you mean ? - You know , his whole - " Stick it to the man " thing . - He looks out for us . All right . You , or his union ? You 're barkin ' up the wrong tree , bro . Here , now , I got nothing . Closest match I found was Nero 's lyre from the great fire of Rome . If you play Sack Of Ilium , it 's said to burn and peel your face off . Eww ! Well , that 's not exactly what this does . Besides , I don 't think that anyone in this gym could play The Sack Of Ilium - on a lyre . - So your union rep ... Does he , uh , does he collect anything antique-y ? Who knows . Probably . What do you care ? No , I 'm just saying maybe he took out a couple guys to make Siskel look bad . Ooh ! Oh ! Oh ! In 1996 , Siskel- - he was then Hank Blaloc- - he owned a restaurant in Oakland . He was arrested for labor abuse of illegal busboys . So the man is trash . Sadly , he 's just not our main suspect anymore . Well , then , who is ? Fight ! Nice ! Myka , do you even have a suspect ? Possibly . You got something to say to me ? Uh , no , no . Just , uh , getting some exercise . Then why all the questions ? Well , some guys are getting sick . Town hates Siskel , and that works out for you . Oh . Okay , that 's not good . Well , what 's wrong ? Myka , where 's Pete ? Uh , he 's doing some hands-on i-i-interrogating . I 'll call you back . Come on , Sam ! It 's cool ! - Just chill out ! - Yeah , I got it , Sam . - Oh , boy . - Let 's go , Cody ! - What do you got against Sammy ? - Sammy ? We 're friends . - Really ? - Yeah . - Hey , you 're a marine , huh ? - That 's right . - Me too . What 'd you serve ? - 4th Battalion , 3rd Marines . Fallujah and Al Asad airbase . Two different tours . And yourself ? 5th Battalion , 7th Marines . Afghanistan , the quiet years . Well , you know , quieter . Okay . So why are you after my friend ? I 'm not ! But people are being poisoned . And he 's got a motive . - Hey ! - Hey , it was a clean hit ! Pete , are you okay ? Pete ? Maybe I shouldn 't have asked . I know this sounds ... well , completely insane . But Steve is connected to this . And we had hoped by coming here we could u-unconnect him . I-I 'm not even gonna pretend to understand what you 're talking about . I just thought that Steve was finally here to talk about everything after all this time . Can I ask ... just what happened ? Sometimes , you get a look , and you 're just like her . - My girl . - Yeah , Steve 's mentioned that . So , um , it started at the sentencing for the boy who killed Olivia . A robbery gone bad , wasn 't it ? Mm-hmm . And the state wanted to make an example of him , so he was facing the death penalty . And the trial , it- - all the months before , the waiting ... oh . There 's so much anger and pain , and ... I needed it to be over . Did they--I mean , did he get the death penalty ? I didn 't see the point of adding this boy 's family 's suffering to our own . It was enough that he was going to spend the rest of his life in jail , so I- - I fought against it . That must 've been so hard . Yes , until I saw his mother 's face . It was the right thing to do . But Stevie felt like I had betrayed Olivia . I thought that we would eventually make our peace , and get past it , but he- - - But he just left . - Yeah . Hmm . This poem , it reminds me of the day my babies were born . " From whence one comes . " From whence one comes ? You know , I don 't think there 's a moment in a mother 's life that 's more pure than that . " Make a pure start . " Pete ? Pete , it 's time for the big fight . Okay . Thank you . I 'm g--I 'm fine . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . Thank you . Thank you very much . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to Tully 's . We got a great fight tonight . In the blue corner , weighing in at 175 pounds , the best of buhl ... Todd Murray ! Are you sure you 're okay ? You still look a little woozy . That 's my look . Weighing in at 180 ... There are a lot more people here , though , right ? - Yes . - Okay . Dalton 's new hope ... Cody Bell ! Oh , ow ! Loud ! Loud ! Pete , listen . When Cody hit you , I think that I-I saw something . All I saw were stars . Oh , and birds . No ! Listen to me ! It--it was almost like a shadow on his arm , and then a loud noise like , uh--like a yell . So , what , you think he whammied me ? It went by so fast , I-I , honestly , I just- - - I don 't know ! - Well , my money 's on Garity . Every time I ask , his boys unleashed . Well , let 's go find out . - Okay . - Okay . You sure you 're okay ? Yeah . Pound him , Code ! Watch the hook ! Garity ! Hey , we know it 's you . You know it 's me what ? That 's the stuff ! He 's only been fightin a couple of months . - The kid 's a natural . - Hey , quit stalling ' , okay ? Whatever you guys are using , it 's killing people . I told you , Siskel 's your man . Go Code ! Do it for Charlie ! Who 's Charlie ? His dad . Foreman who had the accident ? Wait--Sam , is Cody using something to--to make himself stronger ? What the hell are you saying now ? Does Cody know Karen Miller ? Yeah , yeah , they went out a couple times . Oh , my God . Pete ! Pete , just- - just take him . I 'll stay here . He 's out ! Cody Lane , Dalton 's own champeen ! Hey , Marlene ! Now we can finally get that roof of yours fixed ! Woo ! - Hey . - Pete , I was right . I did see something . Question is : What is it ? You still pissed ? I 'm sorry . It 's- - this all just- - it makes me crazy . Well ... Schumann did go insane . Okay , that 's not helping . You know , in a parallel universe , I could totally see this being my room . Steve , what if " From whence one comes " isn 't your home- - it 's your mom ? And--and " Make a pure start , " that 's the day you were born , a moment of pure love between you two . What--what if Schumann was tight with his mom ? I guess it 's all over then . Why are you so angry ? I talked to her about it , and I get where she- - He killed my sister ! Yes , and isn 't forgiveness a big part of the buddhism thing ? Well , I am a work in progress , okay ? I just--I don 't get how you can miss your daughter so much that you keep her room intact for years , but then you go out , and you fight for her murderer 's life . I tried to tell you , but you didn 't wanna hear it . So tell me now . Steven , they 're separate things . Loving my daughter and my conscience , they 're- - they 're separate things ! This is not good for your soul ! All this hate and anger is not good for you ! No , mom ! I am sorry . That scumbag is alive , and Livvy is dead . I mean , how can you- - it 's like you- - you just flip a switch . Except that I didn 't . How can you say that ? I live with her death as much as you do . And I-I didn 't- - I didn 't forgive that boy- - Well , it sure looked like it . No , I have to forgive him every day , again and again , over and over . Every single day of my life , I have to let go of my anger . How do you do that ? Mom , because I sure as hell can 't . I think about her . You think about him every day , but I-I think about her , because it 's what she would do , and I think that you know that . I wanna let it go . I really--I really do . But I don 't know how . I don 't know . Maybe do what your mom does , maybe . Think of Olivia . No , never been to Tully 's , but my boy sure is making me proud . Yeah , he seems like a great guy . - I-I get a good vibe from him . - Mr. Bell , where do you think that Cody 's sudden newfound boxing strength comes from ? Anger , maybe . Our accident got him pretty upset . Somebody messed with that gantry to make it fail . Okay , you just said " our " accident . You mean Cody was there ? Was he there ? He saved my life . Damn it ! I 'm getting too old for this . Dad ! No ! No--ahh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! Ahh ! - Ahhhhhhh ! - Ahh ! - Ahh ! - Eyahh ! Ahhhhh ! Dad , you all right ? It was unbelievable . I 'm 220 pounds ... And he lifted me up with one arm . Mr. Bell , we think that Cody may be using something artificial to enhance his strength . - You mean like ' roids ? - Like ' roids on ' roids . No ! No way . It ain 't bad enough he did two tours in hell , comes home to a dead-end job in a busted-up town . Now you think he 's juicing ' ? There . Read that . My boy is a hero . Purple heart . Rescued two other soldiers - in an IED explosion . - " National museum . " Pete , uh- - Mr. Bell ! Would you , um , just excuse us for a second ? Thank you . Yes ! December 2005 . It was an explosion at the Baghdad National Museum . South wing , they were housing a collection of 7th century Peloponnesian items . - Peloponnesian ? Uh , the Greeks ? - The 300 Spartans and their stand against the Persians . Ah , dude , I love that movie ! I work out to it all the time . Here ! All right . Spartan armor said to have been imbued with their strength and defiance . It sounds like Cody , f-fighting for his dad , - for his town . - Okay , but where do we find the artifact ? I mean , what are we looking for , - a suit of armor ? - Well , it could be in a piece of helmet , it could be in a breast plate . I know that archaeologists have found traces of iron in Spartan armor , which would explain the rusting . All right , we need to search his house . Wait , wait , the newspaper article . The--the article said that- - said that Cody was- - was struck by shrapnel during the explosion . So what if he doesn 't know that he has it ? - Holy crap , are you thinking- - - Th-the scars on Cody 's chest , if they were caused during the explosion- - The artifact could be inside him . As shrapnel . That--that 's a new one . The scars- - the scars are on the left side , uh , of Cody 's chest , which is connected to his left arm , the same arm that Tim held at the picket line , the arm that Sam Garity pushed at the gym , probably even the same arm that Cody used to save his father ! Yeah , no , no , Mykes , ' cause he punched me with that arm . How come I 'm not sick , or--or the other boxers ? Well , boxing gloves- - maybe- - maybe it has to be skin-on-skin . And only in an emotionally-heightened moment - would its power be focused . - No , no , his dad 's not rusting . Okay ? Cody grabbed his arm . He saved his dad 's life . That 's pretty emotionally-heightened . Exactly . It 's possible that that incident is what activated the shrapnel inside him . Right , because Cody started making people sick - after the mill accident . - You know what ? This sucks . Okay ? I don 't wanna take away this kid 's strength . This town needs something to root for . Pete , Cody already put four people in the hospital who are going to die i-i-if we don 't get this thing out of him . The only question is : - How do we do it ? - Hey , Cody ! Your dad 's doing much better . You been in to see him ? Uh , no , uh--wait a minute . This started at the mill ? - It 's me ? - Look , Cody- - I 'm the one making people sick ? When were you gonna tell me , man- - - Just come with us . - No , get off me ! - Get away from me ! - Hey , Cody ! - Hey , we just wanna help ! - Whoa-whoa-whoa ! Cody ! Aah ! I bet I know where he 's gone . Mom , I am so sorry . All that I had left of her was my anger . Maybe I got scared that letting that go - meant letting her go . - You couldn 't let go of her if you tried . - Mrs. Jinks ? - Mom ! Mom , what 's wrong ? - Oh , my God ! - It 's the metronome ! - Emma ! Emma , breathe ! - It won 't stop ! Mom ! - Claudia , please do something ! - I don 't know what to do ! - Breathe , Emma ! - Damn thing ! Jinksy , no ! Mom ! Hey--hey , it 's okay ! It 's okay . It 's okay , it 's okay . You 're all right . It 's over . - Claudia ? Claudia , am I- - - Yeah . You 're alive . Can you feel my heart beating ? What--what just happened ? A--a pure start . You didn 't care if you died . All you cared about was her , so you sacrificed your own heart to save her . An act of pure love . Welcome back , Jinksy . Welcome home . You almost killed my dad ! - Your father had an accident . - That you set up for insurance money , Siskel , and everyone knows it ! - Kid , you 're outta your mind ! - Am I ? 'Cause somehow now , because of that accident , I am poisoning people ! Everyone--my friends , everyone ! - Cody , no ! - Ee-yahhh ! Man , are you nuts ? You guys told me this thing is killing people ! You are a hero , Cody , okay ? Don 't waste it on a guy like Siskel . - No , get out of my way- - - No ! - Get out of my way ! - No- - - Where 's Cody ? - You keep him away from me . - Where is he ? - He 's by the milling machines . You see ? It 's starting to happen to you now . That 's right , and it 's gonna keep happening , 'cause I 'm not gonna let you do this ! Ahh ! He saved me from that psycho Cody Bell . Now let me go , will ya ? No , I 'm not quite done with you yet . Siskel took everything from me ! No ! No , he hasn 't ! You know who you are , Cody . This town needs you ! It needs you- - Move ! Siskel has to pay ! I know who you are . You 're Hank Blaloc . You cut corners and played games in Oakland , just like you did here . - You can 't prove that . - Really ? Should I call the FBI , or OSHA , or maybe just your insurance adjuster with a theory ? Or I could just hand you over to Cody . All right , all right , all right , yes , yes . The gantry was rigged for the insurance money . But they weren 't supposed to try fixing it . Nobody was supposed to get hurt . What do you want from me ? You 're going to make this right . Why is this happening to me , man ? Huh ? All we wanted is a fair shake , that 's it ! No , just stay down ! Stay down ! No--no ! No , you 're gonna have to kill me . Come on ! Could you do it , Cody ? Are you a killer ? Are you a killer ? - No , I 'm not . - Good . - What did you do to him ? - Look , I 'm sorry . He kept coming at me . Look , I didn 't mean to hurt anyone . I 'm--I 'll go get an ambulance . No--no , wait ! It 's not gonna help , okay ? In order to stop this , in order to save everyone , we need to neutralize the shrapnel that 's in your chest . Neutralize--okay . It 's--whatever- - how do we do that ? - We remove it . - You can 't , it 's up against my heart here . You 'll kill me . Okay , so--so--so- - so we improvise . - How ? What ? - I just--don 't know ! The first aid kit . Bring me the first aid kit . Pete , I 'm gonna figure this out , okay ? You 're gonna be okay . - Okay . - We can 't bring the artifact to the goo , I will bring the goo to the artifact . - Mykes , what are you doing ? - I 'm bringing the goo - to the artifact . - Can you do that ? Do you have a better idea ? - No . - Look--look-look , just do it , okay ? Forget about me . Save them . Do it ! 'Cause if you won 't , I will . - Oh , my God . - Do it . Okay ! Okay ! Ahh ! Okay . Okay . Now , that 's a purple heart . How do I thank you guys ? I mean , I still don 't know what happened . But not only did you save me and my friends , it 's like you guys saved our jobs , too . Siskel called Sam Garity , offered to hire us all back in exchange for a truce . Well , I guess you guys had him on the ropes . Yeah . Maybe next time , I get you guys back . Aw , yeah . Yep . I 'll just be over here . - You all right ? - Oh , yeah . Oh , yeah . Sorry I had to kick your ass . I was asking for it , right ? - Semper fi , Marine . - Semper fi , Devil Dog . Take care of yourself . I 'll take it any way I can get it . - Hi . - Hey . So what did you say to Siskel to get him to back off ? Aw , you know , just a little hands-on interrogation . I learned it from my partner . Ah ! No more punching ! I 'm sensitive . We 're fortunate Leena had seen where he 'd hidden it . I don 't know how comfortable I feel not telling him . It 's for his own safety . The less Arthur knows about the whereabouts of the Astrolabe , the better it is for all of us . Take this , and disappear . I 'd rather stay here and help you with the brotherhood . We cannot risk undoing what Arthur did to restore the Warehouse . Yes . Well , I suppose that wouldn 't be - to my particular advantage . - Nor mine . But that 's not the point , as you know . I 'll leave Leena my research on the dagger . It 's proven quite elusive . I 'll try to settle this with the brotherhood . In the meantime , you cannot communicate with any of us . The brotherhood will apparently stop at nothing to force Arthur to use the Astrolabe again . You can trust no one .

 Previously on Marvel 's " Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... This device turns any moisture around it to ice very rapidly , at a great range . That 's what you 're trying to power ... a bigger version of the ice machine ? - This is very , very dangerous . - What will happen to him ? They 're moving him to the Sandbox . They want to keep an eye on him . Ward ! Your attempt to cross off Fitz and Simmons failed , but Fitz may never be the same again . Since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse , talking to himself more and more . I 'm being overly discreet with this operation . I know how long you have been searching for this , - Dr. Whitehall . - You have no idea . 2x03 - " Making Friends and Influencing People " First time I drank this , I had just enlisted . It was bland , immature . But I had a hunch . - I bought a case . - Mm . Mmm . $ 10 seemed so expensive back then . And now one bottle costs over $ 2,000 . Goes to show you patience is most definitely a virtue ... something we 've both benefited from . I believe in second chances . I want us to work together . I want you to become a valued member of our organization . Surrender ... and you will find meaning . Surrender ... and you will find release . Take a deep breath . Calm your mind . You know what 's best . What 's best is you comply . Compliance will be rewarded . Are you ready to comply , Agent 33 ? I will never work for Hydra . I expected it would be a long night . Why I decided to treat myself . Mm . Mr. Bakshi , let 's go again . Where do we start ? At the beginning ? Like the song says , a very good place to start . You and I both know the Faustus method takes time . And I 've got plenty . ♪ There is no way I 'm looking for a boyfriend ♪ ♪ there is no way I 'm looking for a scene ♪ ♪ I need to save some dough ♪ ♪ I 'm a working girl , you know ♪ ♪ I 'll fend attention off , I keep to myself ♪ ♪ I love my room , I 'm getting used to sleeping ♪ ♪ some nights I really like to lie awake ♪ ♪ I hear the midnight birds ♪ ♪ the message in their words ♪ ♪ the dawn will touch me in a way a boy could never touch ♪ ♪ their promise never meant so much to me ♪ ♪ you have been warned ♪ - Morning , Theo . - ♪ I 'm warned to be contrary ♪ That smile . - A breath of sunshine ... - ♪ backward at school ♪ - ... in an otherwise dreary morning . - ♪ I wrote from left to right ♪ Oh , you 're too sweet .

You see , those samples - you gave me are quite fasc ... - I 'll read all about it once you finish your report . Have it on my desk as soon as possible . - I imagined they were all Ward . - Imagine they 're all targets . Don 't get cocky . This is step one . - It 's all about control ... - Control . I know . ... over your mind , your body . Don 't forget your mind . In the field , you need to maintain control . Whatever the situation ... hostages , bombs about to go off ... So , what you 're saying is what I just did was puny and sad . 61 beats per minute . Consistent the whole time . Not that puny . Speaking of not puny ... Yeah , I want you to get used to this . It 's a sniper rifle . Huh . Pardon me . Uh , just one quick question . - You went to S.H.I.E.L.D. academy , right ? - You didn 't . If you did , you would have known better than to shoot us . Apology number 470 ... I am very sorry , Agent May . Don 't be sorry . Just wait . Uh , we just have a little wager . - Uh , so , did you ... ? - Go to the academy ? Yeah , no . - No . - All right , well , have fun with the inventory . And remember , Koenig likes them neat . Oh , and , uh , none of those euro sevens with the lines through them . - Drives him crazy . - Coulson said you were a field agent - with a badge and all . - More like a work-study thing . Badge , I had for like a day before S.H.I.E.L.D ... You know , Hartley ... she loved her blade , hated guns . Idaho ... if on a job someone ended up dead , he 'd go to church , light a candle . Said it 'd balance the karma . See , I knew them , what they 'd do , not do . So , us being workmates and all ... You 're wondering if I 've ever taken anyone out . - Have you ? - Not that I know of . Hey . Don 't you have inventory ? I suppose now I do . Good afternoon , ladies . Practice . I want you to get used to the recoil . And for the record , experience doesn 't make it any easier to cross someone off . You 're alone . Should I assume ? That the entire trip was a waste of precious jet fuel ? - Yep . Assume that . - At least tell me that Agent 33 retired . Nope . They got to her first . It 's gone from being a land grab to a talent grab . And I 'm getting damn tired of losing our best and brightest to Hydra . Ms. Simmons , I need everything you have - on the samples you 're working on . - I 'm not done . - I 'm testing a second set of dn ... - Right . Just whatever you have . What I have is more questions than answers . Okay , know what ? I get it . You don 't have time . Neither do I. The time tables have moved up , and I have been called upstairs to fill them in . No prep time , no powerpoint , just me , pants around my ankles , talking out of my butt . If you want , I could accompany you , present my analysis . Oh , no , y-you don 't want to go up there . The higher you go ... the scarier it is . Okay . Well , what you can say is that the cells have an abnormal ability to create - trace amounts of liquid nitrogen . - That 's odd . What about the DNA markers ? Normal . The anomaly appears to be environmental , not genetic . - Is that ... - It 's just another acquisition . I thought that was broken for good . - You clearly have a gift . - A degree . I used to study engineering . You know , I could help out around here . Fix things in exchange for room and board . It 's been a while since I 've liked being somewhere . Marrakech has a long history of giving shelter to travelers hiding from their past . Why would you think I 'm hiding ? - Who were you speaking to ? Huh ? - They threatened me ! They said you were dangerous and ... Mr. Gill . We don 't want to hurt you . Stand down , agent . Holster your weapon . Mr. Gill ... we just want to talk . - If you would just hear me out . - No . I can 't . " Maribel del Mar. " Did you think I wouldn 't find out ? Sriracha ? Beer ? That 's all ? - What kind of diet is that ? - Well , I also have tea . And if my diet 's such a concern , then perhaps dead drops shouldn 't involve fast food . We 'll revisit that protocol . I picked up some groceries . We 've got ... steak ... grass-fed ... fingerling potatoes , kale ... organic . It 's basic , but I do good basic . While I cook , you debrief . - Do you remember Donnie Gill ? - From the academy ? I mean , I knew he was a gifted scientist , but you 're saying he 's ... a gifted scientist . Gill was struck by lightning while holding the device that created the storm . Perhaps the electrical surge infused his system with a freezing agent ? It 's just ... well , it 's just speculation . They 're keeping me sequestered in the downstairs lab . I usually advance much more quickly , but they are intent on wasting my talents doing rudimentary biochem and molecular analysis on blind samples . It 's not about your intellect . Have you made friends ? Oh , sir , you don 't need to worry . I mean , it 's been a tad lonely , true , but ... You weren 't asking out of concern of my feelings , were you ? Undercover is all about the relationships you make . If you 're gonna move up in Hydra , you need to make friends . Be like Ward ? - I can 't lie like he did . - You don 't need to . Selective truths . You 're very likable . Use that . So , how is everyone ? Fitz is okay . He 's hanging in there . You think they 're trying to recruit Donnie Gill as a scientist ? That would be the best-case scenario . Most likely scenario ... Hydra 's looking for another weapon . From what we 've been able to piece together , Donnie Gill had limited powers when he entered the Sandbox , but ... While there , he was taught to control , amplify those powers . Lovely . And who , exactly , do we have to thank for that ? - S.H.I.E.L.D. or Hydra ? - Your guess is as good as ours . Hydra had scientists embedded at the base . Explains how they took it so quickly . A friend of mine was stationed there . He said it got bad fast . - Is that when Gill escaped ? - I don 't know . What I do know is Creel wasn 't an isolated incident . I 've been told Gill 's next on Hydra 's wish list . - Told by who ? - I have a source . - A source you trust ? - Very much so . Now , I want us to bring Gill in before Hydra gets their hands on him . Fitz , you know him better than any of us . Got anything to help us narrow the search ? Um ... well ... the la ... the last time that I saw him , - he was , um ... - Angry ? On drugs ? - Uh ... friendly ? Sleeping ? - Yeah . - Sleeping ? - No . What ... the one ... the ... go back one . - Friendly ? - Friendly . Um ... uh ... no , he had trouble making friends . - Anything else ? - I don 't know . Maybe ask Jemma if you have a contact number for her . - Okay . And if you think of anything ... - Yeah , we 'll work on it . May , you lead the search to find Gill . Let me know as soon as you have something . - Scan satellite feeds for any temp ... - Shouldn 't Skye be here ? She 's working another angle . Well , they 're not exactly what you 'd call welcoming . - They don 't give you a choice . - So , what do they give you ? Money ? Threats ? Torture ? - Combo platter ? - They 're good at convincing people . Yeah , well , they suckered you in . No . I was never loyal to Hydra . I was loyal to Garrett . Oh . Garrett is the reason you 're a cold-blooded killer . I don 't blame him for the choices I 've made . Right . I seem to remember you blaming your brother . Or was it your parents ? Man , I can 't keep up . My family tore me down . Garrett built me back up ... the way he wanted . We 're all aware of who your family is , Ward . Not only are they respected . They 're pretty much loved . Well , every family has its secrets . Yours does , too . - You ever wonder why ... - You know what ? My bad . I slipped . Talked to you like a normal person . Let 's stay on task . You make the rules . Hydra 's protocol on gifteds is pretty straightforward . An acquisition team is sent out to convince or capture the gifted . If those two options aren 't possible , then they 'll take them out . Even if the gifted doesn 't pose a threat ? A gifted that refuses Hydra is a threat . And threats are taken care of quickly . That 's the difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra . And that 's why Hydra will win . Because while a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent is considering right and wrong , Hydra 's already taken the shot . Make friends . Mr. Turgeon , hello ! I was thinking of going over to salties . Happy hour and karaoke could be a load of ... - Uh , Ms. Simmons ... - Call me Jemma . Jemma , you are wanted upstairs for questioning . - Is this regarding my analysis ... - It 's a security matter . Uh , yes . These men will escort you . - What did you do ? - Nothing . I haven 't done anything . Well , then I 'm sure you have nothing to worry about . Madam , come with us . Floor number 25 . Ms. Simmons . Have a seat . Leave us . Stay close ... in case there are consequences . You 've been lying to us , Ms. Simmons . Not long ago , you were a level 5 S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Yes , before S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s fall . I was candid about my work history . - You left things out . - If I did , it wasn 't intentional . Stop ... lying . You 've been doing cellular analysis for project Blizzard , yet didn 't inform your supervisor that you knew the subject . I didn 't realize it was Gill until yesterday , when I saw a photo in Kenneth 's file . - I-I would have said something ... - Yet you didn 't . What else ... are you hiding ? I didn 't want to corrupt my analysis ... analysis which I 'd done before I knew who it was . - I-I barely knew him . - You saved his life . Only because I happened to be at the academy giving a le ... a lecture . - You seem nervous . - Because I am . I was escorted here by armed guards . I 'm well aware of who I work for . Hmm . Let 's discuss your previous employer . Why did you join S.H.I.E.L.D. in the first place ? I was a 17-year-old girl with two Phds and a million questions . S.H.I.E.L.D. had the resources to help me answer them . - Now they don 't , and Hydra does . - So your loyalties are with us ? My loyalties are with science . So long as Hydra allows me to do the work I want to be doing , then , yes , my loyalties are with Hydra . Well , loyalties can be tested . Why cling to the founding principles of S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Freedom . Equality . Individual rights . These principles make mankind a plague on this planet . Think of a forest . It dries up and catches fire with the first spark . Now , mankind would fight that fire , believing every individual plant perfect in its own individual way . But it 's the fire that 's perfect . Essential . Now more magnificent plant species , like the giant sequoia , their seeds need the heat of that fire to crack open and be born . To literally rise from the ashes . And they will live for a thousand years . You don 't need to keep burning . - Rise . Be born . - Sir , I hate to interrupt , but I 'd like to evaluate one of our employees and act with authority . Mr. Bakshi , I trust you to do what needs to be done . Are you ready to comply ? Maribel del Mar. Anchored in the port of Casablanca . It 's a privately owned cargo ship . Supposed to cast off this morning but didn 't . It 's frozen in ice . Iceberg in the middle east ? Gill 's not subtle . Trip , how long till you can have the bus in the air ? - 15 , tops . - You heard him . You got 15 minutes to gather your gear . Excuse me , but Gill wasn 't hard to track . - If Hydra are looking , they 'll find him . - The asset said Hydra would be ready to take him out if they couldn 't capture or recruit him . - Which is why we have to beat them to it . - I 'll coordinate from the bus . Down to 14 minutes . Let 's get moving . They 're taking the bus . You know what that means ? Means we got the night off . Koenig 's on assignment and won 't be hogging the Xbox . Man , why aren 't you happier about this ? 'Cause I should be going . I mean , I-I knew him . No need to feel bad about it . It is what it is . Skye 's asset . Now Donnie . They 're ... they 're keeping things from me . Yeah , they 're keeping you from an icy death . That 's it . Come on , now . Don 't start getting paranoid on me . Where are you taking me ? Thank you . Thanks very much . Ms. Simmons . Do you have anything warmer ? - I 'll grab you something before we leave . - Leave ? Where to ? We 've found Donnie Gill . We 've tried bringing him into the fold before . Now we have a second chance . With you ... a friendly , honest face . Maybe we 'll have better luck . - He 's dangerous , isn 't he ? - Don 't worry . We 'll have your back every step of the way . Suit up . It 's going to get cold . You have no idea what you are bringing down on yourself . - We will find you . - I know . I want to be left alone , but you people won 't stop coming after me ! So I 'm done hiding . It 's time Hydra learned once and for all ... I 'm not interested . I 'm not afraid . I 'm pissed off . And every Hydra agent they send is going to feel it . Fitz , please , this is ridiculous . What , exactly , are you hoping to accomplish ? The asset Skye 's been talking to ... - it 's him . - Oh , Mack was right . You 're sounding paranoid . Stop assuming the worst . They 're keeping things from me , and I just want to know the truth . Fitz . You need to be honest with yourself . You 're barely holding it together . There 's a reason they 're keeping things from you . - I don 't think you should go in there . - You are not here . I imagine you 've got a lot to say to me . Look , despite all of this it 's really good to see you . - Fitz ? Fitz , are you al ... - Stop . Stop talking . Stop . I 'll be listening to everything . You run into any trouble , I 'll be in your ear , talking you through it . And what if he doesn 't respond well ? Then I suppose there 'll be a job opening at our laboratory . Your first jump ? Second . First was with Coulson and Lola . It 's a car . It flies ... Yeah , this is my first . - It 's okay to be scared . - I 'm not scared . Maybe you should be . I packed your chute . And according to my ex , my folding skills are abysmal . - Hmm . - Nice thing is this is as scary as it gets . Once you jump , physics takes over . - Yeah , I 'm good . Thanks . - Trip says two minutes out . Remember , Donnie Gill 's a gifted . He could be a formidable weapon for either side . Let 's make sure it 's ours . I didn 't want to hurt you . - I tried to avoid it . - You tried to kill us . No . I wanted to save you . Garrett ordered me to kill you and Simmons . He expected me to put a bullet in your head . But I couldn 't . I gave you a fighting chance to find a way out , like you always do . Like you did . Save me ? Do ... do you ... do you ... do you know what the , um ... what you ... Okay . I ... you know , I have trouble with words , so , um it 's probably best that I show you . - Show me what ? - Hypoxia . Found that one . That 's what you did to me . Fitz ? What are you doing ? I 'm showing you ... what it 's like when you 're deprived of , uh ... The oxygen ... b ... the brain cells , they ... they re ... they react first . They die . Three minutes , damage is permanent . Where 's Skye ? Gone . They 're all gone after Donnie . And I should be there with them . But I can 't be because of you , because of what you did to me ! - I 'm damaged ! - Donnie ... Donnie ... Donnie Gill . That 's ... that 's why Skye was ... No ! I 'm not ... I-I don 't ... I don 't , uh ... - I don 't answer , uh ... - Fitz . Listen to me . Listen . You they don 't know what they 're walking into . Hello ? Donnie ? Oh . I 'm looking for ... I 'm looking for Donnie Gill . Hello ? You may not remember me . - Agent Simmons ? - Donnie . - It 's nice to see you again . - Who ... who sent you ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ? H-Hydra ? What ... what side did you end up on ? I 'd like to think I 'm on your side . Get close to him . Convince him you want to help . I saved your life once . I heard you were in trouble . Please , I ... I need you to hear me out . - Coulson , we 're not alone . - Not what I hoped , but not unexpected . Proceed . Let me know when you have eyes on Gill . Copy that . Skye , you cover the door . - You don 't give the orders , Trainspotting . - I 'm not Scottish . - Skye , protect the exit route . - Roger that . Mack ! - Come on , this time . Come on . - Mack ! - Aah ! Come on ! - Mack ! - Oh , my god . - Hey . Hey , hey ! What the hell , man ? ! I just took out the boomers ! Uh , the bus ! The bus ! We need to talk to the bus ! Fitz would talk about you . He described the blueprints he saw in your room . He was quite impressed . And Fitz is very hard to impress . Get him to trust you . You 're a lot like him . Like both of us , really . We 're scientists ... wired to solve problems . Maybe before . It 's different now . Oh , I don 't believe you . You must miss it . Minds like ours ... they need to be used . I 'm tired of being used . Don 't let him get angry . Repeat what I say . Take a deep breath . Take a deep breath . And clear your mind . Surrender and you will find meaning . Surrender and you will find release . - Agent Simmons ... - Take a deep breath . Donnie didn 't escape the Sandbox ! - He took the Sandbox for Hydra . - Hydra recruited Gill ? - Uh ... the ... the brain . The brain . - They brainwashed him . And they 're gonna re-trigger his programming if they can . - How do you know this ? - I spoke to Ward . We 'll talk about that when I get home . Nice work , Fitz . May , Hunter , do either of you have eyes on Gill ? Not yet . Target is talking to Hydra . - End that conversation . Now . - Copy that . You know what is best . What is best is you comply . Simmons ... You think I don 't know what you 're trying to do ? You 're just like the rest of them . You liar ! What am I hearing ? - Agent May shot me . - Repeat ? - May shot me . - Man , I wanted to be the one . Simmons is here . Repeat ... Simmons is on site with Hydra . - Do we maintain her cover ? - Yes . Maintain her cover . - Your source ? - My source . - That 's crazy . - What about the primary target ? If we can 't take him in , we take him out . - Do you copy ? - Copy that . Copy . - Is he far behind ? - Not far . - I 'm sorry . I tried . - It 's all right . Conditions are better here , anyway . Good afternoon , Mr. Gill . - You . - Take a deep breath . - No . - Calm your mind . - No . Please . Please . - You know what is best . - What is best is you comply . - I ... Don 't ... Compliance will be rewarded . Mr. Gill ... are you ready to comply ? - I 'm happy to comply . - Prove it , then . Keep us from being followed . Lets move ! - What just happened ? - You laid the groundwork and gave us a second chance . He 's with us again . Let 's head out . Ice everyone inside this ship . No one leaves here alive . Exit 's this way . It 's frozen . Let me . We trapped . Let 's go ! The threat 's been neutralized . - Hydra doesn 't have him . - And Agent Simmons ? Her cover 's been maintained . She 's safe for now . They 're leaving empty-handed . But we 're not . Nice payload . Too bad we couldn 't make off with the whole cargo ship . Want to take a bet how much tech 's in the cargo ? Not gonna sucker me into doing your inventory , Mack . Good try , though . - Trip , have you seen Skye ? - Upstairs . In case you 're wondering , I 'm all right . Nasty-looking bruise on my shoulder . - Hurts like hell , but I deserved it . - Mm-hmm . - So , we 're even ? Right ? - We are . Oh , bloody hell . What are you doing in here ? I don 't know . It reminds me of before . Should replace the glass if we 're gonna take her out regularly . I 've been monitoring Moroccan law-enforcement channels . They still haven 't found Donnie Gill 's body yet . - You okay ? - No . I get why Coulson kept what Simmons was doing from us . I understand he 's protecting her , making sure no one compromises her mission , - but you knew ? - I knew . I 'm scared for her . Simmons in Hydra ? She 's a terrible liar . I 'm serious . I love her , but her trying to lie ... it is a horror show . Maybe before , but not anymore . She can handle it . She 's good . She 's not the only one . We should talk . First of all , I want you to know that I see your progress . You 're an important part of this team , and I don 't want you to forget that . But I saw the recording . Your conversation with Ward . - You almost killed him . - But I didn 't . I 'm not a killer . I can 't look at him . I hate that he 's here . But we barely know anything about Hydra . I need to do whatever it takes to understand the people we 're fighting . Ward is one way I 'm trying to do that . - Well , you should have told me . - Maybe . I didn 't want to add to what you were already dealing with . And is , um ... is there anything ... - is there anything more ? - That I 'm keeping from you ? Yeah . I 'm director . There 's a hell of a lot more . But there is one other thing you should know . Simmons is on an assignment . That 's why she hasn 't been in contact . - That 's why she left . - Hmm . And , um ... did she ask to go on the assignment ? Did she want to leave ? What she 's doing is very important . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s becoming a problem . - Do we know who 's in charge ? - I 'm afraid not . I 'm sorry to interrupt . I was told to bring these . Please , bring it here . - Thank you . I appreciate it . - Happy to comply . Donnie 's programming proved to be unstable . - Ultimately , it held . - One last thing . There 's a scientist in our downstairs lab . I believe her talents are being wasted . I 'd like authorization to bring her up here . - So , you trust her ? - I do now . But if I 'm wrong ... we 'll make her comply . We 'll return in a moment . Relieved it 's not Fitz ? Happy it 's you , that you 're okay . I 'm , uh , glad I could help . You said Hydra had a way of convincing people . You were talking about brainwashing , weren 't you ? It 's not done often , but it 's done . It 's a lot of work , and some people aren 't susceptible . - It 's mostly used on high-value targets . - Like you ? I wish I could say that 's what happened . But I swore I 'd never lie to you . No . I was never brainwashed . Everything I did , good and bad ... I did of my own free will . Do you believe I 'm telling you the truth ? I just don 't know why . I don 't know what you hope to achieve by ... I don 't hope for me . I hope for you . I know something . And I want you to believe me when I say it . Your father is alive . He 's looking for you . And someday , if you let me , I 'll take you to him . We 're done here .

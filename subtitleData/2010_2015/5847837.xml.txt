 Sarah , we make a family . Helena does have a soul , she does have a purpose and she is part of our family now . Go back to hell where you belong . Shit ! Henrik ! I 'm sick , Delphine . Are you my dad ? Where 's my niece ? You left her with Cal ? Your mom has a lot going on right now . " This organism is restricted intellectual property . " They patented us ? Project LEDA . I mean , its total military speak . You know the mythology of Leda and the Swan ? Six scientists incinerated in a lab explosion . FELIX : These were Rachel 's parents . Susan and Ethan Duncan . They were geneticists . I love you , too . You 're not really the smartest clone , are you ? Smart enough to know you 're shagging Rachel . I shot you ! You were dead . You were dead ! They took something from inside of me . HENRIK : And a new life begins . Rachel , uh , you don 't need to see this . I demanded to . Now , move . I 'd like to see him , please . LEEKIE : I 'm sorry , Rachel . Daniel was a very loyal man . - To you . - To us both . This wasn 't Sarah . No . I believe we all recognise the handiwork . Your white wha * le , Aldous . Seems we have a pair of them . Security footage shows her leaving with Sarah . The twins are back together . Fascinating , actually . If one can rise above it , Rache * I. ( WHISPERS ) Animals ... How was Taiwan , Paul ? - You two get along ? - He performed admirably . - I did my job . - Huh . - Personal security , was it ? - That 's right . ALDOUS : She could have killed you , you know . Thank you for your concern . There 's a kinder , gentler way , Rachel . This is all the result of your heavy-handed tactics . Trust me , Aldous , I 've only just begun . You do realise I 'm going to have to paint this to come to terms with it ? Please don 't . Yeah , you 're right . I mean , you shot your evil twin sister dead , only to have her arise and gut Rachel 's henchman . How could I capture the nuance ? Yeah , believe me , you couldn 't . You are now pitted between two psychopaths . Cut her loose . If she hadn 't shown up , I 'd be dead . She can 't stay here , Sarah . She 's not ... Oi , just , just ... Just get her something to wear , p * lease . Fine . I 'm sure I 've got a Ukrainian folk costume in here somewhere . - ( SNARLS ) - Oh ! God . Hey ! Hey , hey , hey . You treat him with respect . You got it ? That 's my brother . Which means he 's one of our sisters . Family . You get it , meathead ? Do not call me this . Do you understand , Helena ? He is sestra . - Oh , God . - Exactly . So take some clothes , wash up and do everything that he tells you to . Thank you , Felix . Just don 't kil * I my rubber ducky . Jesus ! What did those fish cult freaks do to her ? I don 't know , she wouldn 't say . But I know somebody who can handle her , maybe he can find out . - I just need you to chaperone her . - Oh , God . If you would , while I get my shit together , please . You are truly unbelievable . Take this , go talk to your daughter . Thank you . These socks are wet . What ? Agreed . Those are wet socks . Hey , you want to wear my socks ? They 're pretty cool , they 're grey . And they 'll be like knee-highs on you . ( LAUGHS ) No . You know what ? Good call . You 're going to need more than big socks this morning . I know this has been all ... sort of confusing , Kira . I don 't blame you for being put out . But since we 're stuck in this together , there 's no reason why we shouldn 't have a little fun . And there 's no reason why we shouldn 't have really awesome socks . Right ? Sit , please , Paul . I 'm in need of a new monitor . - You have a monitor ? - She did . Daniel . I 've been self-aware since I was a child . I 'm not exempt from the programme . I simply enjoy a unique vantage , one with privilege . She needs full-time personal security . And you submit data to me on her health and wellbeing , like any other subject . Are you asking me if I 'm interested or reminding me I have no choice ? It 's a promotion , Paul . A very handsome one , if you have the starch for it . Where are you with the new stem ce * ll line , Aldous ? My in-vitro tests have been very promising . Promising enough to treat Cosima . Shut down the tests . Until Sarah comes to hee * I , Cosima will suffer . Back in the early ' 80s , genetics was like the wild west . No one knew the science . The laws didn 't exist , so they slapped provisional patents on everything . Like pissing on a fencepost . Yeah . Like , leave it in legal limbo until the laws change or you can figure out if it 's worth anything . They would still have to register them , though , right ? Back then anything as advanced as synthetic DNA would be probably have fallen under the military somehow . If Dyad was just a contractor , it could be a secret military patent . Hmm . That makes sense . Wait . How would I ... How would I find that out ? I guess you wait until a guy in aviators shows up and tells you 're in violation ? Scott , you 're supposed to be my expert on genetic patents here . I just blog about it . Why can 't I come work for you on this super-sensitive shit ? Delphine , why can 't Scott come and work with us on the super-sensitive shit ? Because we 'd have to kill his family . You hear that ? That 's fine . I applied with a letter from the Dean . Hi , Scott . Bye , Scott . He 's so cute . Did you get these ? What ? They 're tissue test results from the stem cell line . One that I 've never seen before . And they are ... What ? Compatible . With you . Really ? But they were sent to me by mistake . They were meant for Leekie . He 's supposed to share all the science with us . Why don 't we have these cultures ? I don 't know . Because they 're experimental or proprietary . That doesn 't matter . I 'll try anything . So will I. - Where are you ? - SARAH : I 'm , uh ... I 'm in a place where bands play . KIRA : What bands ? I don 't know , Bobby ? Who " s playing tonight ? The Shit Goblins . Sorry ! Sorry . I miss you , monkey . I 'm not a monkey any more . You 're not ? I 'm a leopard . Cool ! Yeah . Wow , I like the jacket , too . You can talk to daddy now . Hey ! Monkey ... Kira ? ( SIGHS ) Daddy . Sorry about that . I keep telling her it 's Cal . But she Daddied me twice this morning . She can call you what she wants . It 's fine . You sure you 're okay ? Mind if we don 't get into it ? A little . Fine . How about this , then ? That guy , um , you crashed into . Yeah . That Dyad gentleman ? Yeah . We * ll , he didn 't ... He didn 't die . Not by your hand . I 'm relieved , you know . Ostensibly . Where are you guys ? Close enough to grab you when you 're ready . I look forward to that . All right , best behaviour , little ... sestra . Hello again , Detective Bell . Inside . Hands on the table . I don 't like to be touched . Yeah ? We * l * I , that 's too bad . I just gave her new clothes . She didn 't have any weapons or anything like ... That 's my pen . I wanted to write letter . I haven 't forgotten that you took a shot at me . ( GIGGLES ) Give me your hands . Do as he says , meathead . The windows are a 30-foot drop to concrete . All sharp objects have been locked away . The only way in and out of here is through me . So in other words ... - You 're safe here . - Look , Helena , he wants to help you and Sarah . He lies down with pigs . ( SNORTING ) And that 's my cue to leave . I 've got a hot date , too . Um , good luck with ... that . Oh , um ... Try food . Gracie won 't talk and so she remains until she admits the truth . Are you sure she 's lying ? We both know . If she won 't open her heart to Helena , then she 's clinging to the old ways . A punishment to fit the crime , Henrik . It 's been 12 hours . Well ... Gracie , you ready to tell us what really happened with Helena ? She can rot . Well , I 'm going to have to come after you and tickle you ! - Here I come , the tickle monster ! - ( SHRIEKS ) - Oh , no ! - ( LAUGHING ) - Thanks , Mummy . I love you . - What about poor Daddy ? I love you , too , Daddy . Now , go get ... Sarah 's trying to learn everything about me . Just as I am with her . I want us to be c * lear , Pau * I. As my monitor , you report my data to Aldous but you work for me . Do you understand ? Not exactly . I 've known Leekie my entire life . When my adoptive parents died , he became something of a guardian to me . But now my position in the corporation essentially outranks his Dyad directorship . He can become too attached to his subjects , myself included . Sometimes he can 't make the hard choices . Did you read the report on Cal Morrison ? Made his money in micro-optics . May have anti-corporate leanings . What is it you 're looking for ? I want to know if he 's the other side of Kira 's biological equation . The timeline works . We can place him with Sarah eight years ago . Does that bother you ? That Sarah is back with the father of her child ? No . Up until now , your entanglements with Sarah have been your saving grace , Paul . I never asked her to cross my path . You didn 't ask for me , either . But now it 's time to make a decision , Pau * I. This is Dan ... This was Daniel 's gun . It can be tied to the murder of a police officer . There 's no middle ground any more . What do you need me to do ? BELL : Hey . ( SNAPPING FINGERS ) Hey ! Maggie Chen . Also a Prolethean . She was your spotter . She tracked down clones for you . The two of you worked together . The thing is , last time I saw you , you were running away from Johanssen 's followers in a wedding dress . You want to tell me what that was all about ? What did they do to you ? BELL : What did they do to you ? How did Maggie find the clones ? How did she communicate with you ? I am a very patient man , Helena . So , I 'm going to just make me ... a grilled cheese sandwich . While you think about it . Sorry I can 't help you out of this . Your dad 's sending me after Helena . She 's got to carry the child , right ? Gracie ... I don 't know if she 's a miracle or not but if something happened , just confess . Confession heals all . It doesn 't matter to me what you did . When I was seven , the nuns said I had devils inside me . Sister Olga locked me in cellar . She gave me darkness . But ... I gave her darkness . Does Sarah know of Swan Man ? I don 't think so . Swan Man played God . How 'd he do that ? He 's in her locker . Whose locker ? Maggie 's ? Why does Rachel want Sarah ? Is it for Kira , too ? Does Maggie Chen have a locker ? How does this help my sestra ? Listen , He * lena . This is really important . I want to tell you something . Yeah ? These I like . ( HEAD OVER HEELS BY TEARS FOR FEARS PLAYING ) # I wanted to be with you alone # And talk about the weather # But traditions I can trace against the child in your face ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ♪ Won 't escape my attention - Hello , Felix . - Colin . - You 're back . - Provisionally .

Search warrant . Oh , shit ! Not again . No , no . It 's a misunderstanding , I 'm sure . How 's it going , Morguey ? Better hope we don 't find anything incriminating in your friend 's place . He won 't ! Probably . I 'm sorry , baby . Shit ! You " re not going to find anything other than a few roaches , all right ? And aren 't you supposed to show me some identification ? Hello , Felix . Oh , you bloody pricks . Why can 't you just leave my sister alone ? Hmm ? Playing with Team Rachel now , yeah ? Got the corrupt arm of the law in her clutch purse ? ( LAUGHING ) So , what 's this ? You come to finish me off ? Big dick Paul ? You were at Cal Morrison 's cabin . No , I don 't know what you 're talking about . What are you going to do with that ? Hey , put that down . Put it down . Paul ? Paul . Paul , what are you doing ? Are you crazy ? What are you doing ? L " m sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! What are you doing ? ( MOBILE RINGING ) Felix ? What the hell 's going on ? PAUL : Hello , Sarah . Where 's my brother ? Right here . I 'm fine . Present company excepted . I have a murder weapon with Felix 's prints on it . What ? And a detective waiting in the hallway to find it . And then they 'll find the gun was used to kill Officer Tom Bowman at your friend Cal 's place . You bloody gutless bastard ! Felix will be charged with murder unless Rachel gets what she wants . So your little trip to Taiwan really paid off . How many clone notches in your belt now , eh Paul ? Three ? She wants everything , Sarah . You , Helena , Kira . No more games . This was never a game , you stupid twat . The ball is in your court , Sarah , and you have until morning . Whoa ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Sarah , Sarah slow down . Art , you 've got to help me with this . Rachel 's ruthless . Okay . I will call some people at the station and see if this is real or if Rachel 'sjust bluffing . They 've got a gun on him . Do you hear me ? Okay , but it 's not that easy to set someone up . Uh , you 've seen what they 're capable of . Don 't do anything crazy , okay ? Do you hear me ? Just come to my p * lace . Yes . Well , what else am I going to do ? I 've got nowhere else to go , do I ? Easy ... Easy . Got you , Arthur . Well , Gracie ? There you go . I was protecting us . Not taking a real life , like ... Like killing a coyote that wants to eat our chickens . I 'm so sorry , Father . Just , uh ... You help us get her back , all will be forgiven . And if you don 't , then you will carry the child yourself . COSIMA : Are you sure this is a good idea ? If he 's withholding promising treatment from you , yes . He 's going to ruin your career and destroy your reputation as a budding lesbian . No , I think he 's probably culturing it himself , so I would check these fridges . For a beaker marked " culture ' " ? ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , shit ... . Shit ! Oh , no ! Dr Cormier . Uh , hey . My bad . I wanted to see the original genome . No , she didn 't . Aldous , you held back a stem cell line from us . In fact , I didn 't . Remember I told you I was developing a pluripotent stem cell line from baby teeth ? Yeah ? But Rachel is obstructing further testing . Why the hell would she do that ? In a word , Sarah . You seen this before ? Who are they ? Two forefathers of the original experiment . This was in Sarah 's possession . I 'm going to tell you something that only a handful of people know . Twenty years ago , there was a fire in one of our labs . Several scientists died . Reams of data lost . And the original genome was destroyed . So all of this secrecy around the original genome is because it doesn 't exist ? Yes . The entire project is essentially an orphan . We lost your pre-history , Cosima . And with it , a * l * I record of several synthetic sequences embedded in your DNA . What kind of synthetic sequences ? Sequences that make you possible . That overcame the viability issues that have haunted us ever since . So you lost the map . So finding the sequence in the genome is like looking for hay in a haystack . So you see , if Sarah has uncovered something , I need to know . I have no idea . Whether I be * lieve that or not , as a gesture of good faith , I 'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment . Dinner 's almost ready . I hope you like burned spaghetti . What are you drawing ? A picture . I didn 't think your mom had any sisters . They 're new . They all look the same but I can tell them apart . What do you mean by that ? - Someone 's coming . - You 're right . ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Who " s there ? Police officer . - Evening . - Evening . Don " t see many RVs this late in the year . Just thought I 'd see how you were making out . Yeah , we 're good . Thanks . - Just camping with my daughter . - Hmm . Mind if I see your ID and vehicle registration ? Sure , no problem . It 's here . Where are you from ? CAL : Uh , Seatt * le . There you go . You 're a long way from home . - Andrew Cooper . - Yep . You heading back out west ? - Yep . Back home . - Hmm . You don 't mind if I take a look inside the RV ? Trick-or-treat ! Whoa ! ( LAUGHING ) Ha * l * loween 's over , kiddo . I know , but you 're burning dinner again . Oh , right , but it ... It gives the food a nice smoky flavour . KIRA : No , it doesn 't . She , uh , she went as some video game character . All right . I 'll let you guys have your supper . Goodnight . Goodnight . You 're quick on your feet , aren 't you ? - Oh , shit ! - Ah . She escaped ? Yeah ! Can you pass me the goddamn keys ? On the fish tank . Yeah . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . - Not this again ? - Yeah . More riddles from your sister . Well , how does it work ? Last time they were GPS coordinates . Three places we 'd been , one we hadn 't . Let 's go . This matches her coordinates , what do you think ? She said something about a locker . Helena ? Don 't jump out and scare us with an axe or some shit . She likes bikes , right ? Yeah . I think she rode off on one . Oh , why the hell would she send us here ? What does she want ? SARAH : Hey . I think this is Maggie Chen 's locker . She must have used it as a drop for information for Helena . She camped out here . What a sad life . Swan Man . - What ? - Swan Man . Helena said that might mean something to you . So , ah , Swan ... Leda and the Swan . And Project LEDA . She said he was playing God . Could that be the same man ? This photo 's like 1977 ? So , he 'd be , what ? In his ' 70s now ? Yeah ... Yeah , cou * ld be . Shit . Well , it cou * ld mean that our creators , one of them , Rachel 's dad , he could still be alive , he didn 't die in the lab explosion . I need to call Cosima . This is something I can use . Something I can trade for Felix . BELL : Sarah ... What ? Sniper rifle . She 's going to kill Rachel . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) Paul ... '63 Margaux . Two glasses . ( HUMMING ) A * litt * le more off the back , Helena . Yes , Rache * I. Of course . So pretty you are . So much money , so much money . Put it down . Take off your shirt . - She 's got about a 20-minute lead on us . - We 're close to Rachel 's . I tell you , she 's fast . Don 't move . Take off your pants . Daniel like that ? Did Sarah ? Hey ! What 's that ? What ? Hey . Stop . Stop . - Hey , hey , hey . Hold up . - That 's her bike . And that 's Rachel 's building right there . Wait , what side is Rache * I 's suite on ? It faces this way . That 's a clear line of sight for a sniper . Come on . Get that chair . Take those off . Sit down . You like my hair , Paul ? Yeah . Very pretty , dirty , sexy Rachel . Like my mother . - Hello , sestra . - Helena , stop . Helena , put the gun down . Mind your weapon , Art , or I pull trigger . ( GRUNTING ) Come see , Sarah . Okay . Helena , you can 't do this . You can 't . Rachel is problem . I fix problem . I wish you could . But they 've got Felix . - Brother-sestra . - He 's in jail . If you kill Rachel , they 're going to keep him there . Look . Look , Sarah . Okay . Always unfaithful . I don 't care about Paul . He doesn 't matter any more . - Then I kill him for it . - No , Helena , stop ! Take your finger off the trigger and put down the gun . No , just ... - Let 's see who 's faster . - Please . I can 't let her shoot . Helena , listen to me . There 's another way . We can make a deal for Felix but I need your help . Only you can help me find Swan Man . You only want to use me . No ... That 's not true . You saved my life . You ... You 're my sister . Helena , I thought ... I thought I 'd killed you . I couldn 't tell anybody what I lost . But you came back . Please , put ... Put down the gun . Please . That 's good . Come down . Thank you . You make me cry , sestra . Come on , meathead . Don 't call me this . ( INAUDIBLE ) There we go . Just an intra-dermal test to see how your body responds . Yeah , so if my arm falls off , then we know . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Or if you grow another limb . - Yeah . - ( BOTH LAUGH ) Um ... Oh , Dr Leekie , in light of what you shared with us earlier , we have a proposition for you . We do ? No , no . Not us . Um , us . I 'm all ears . We want to know ... Do you like to drink beer ? Hmm ? Thank you . Dr Leekie ? Sarah ? So I hear I 'm not the only data you lost . You have something for me ? Professor Ethan Duncan . Alive . Where ? It 's vital my brother goes free . All charges dropped . Find him , I can pull the levers to countermand Rachel and guarantee Cosima will be able to continue the treatment . What , what treatment ? Ah . So you don 't share everything . What ? What , is she sick ? Unfortunately , yes . With what ? With what Katja had ? I 'll let her explain . But all the more reason to find Duncan . I can buy you three days . If anybody follows us , I 'm gonna stick Helena on all of you . - Not an idle threat . - No , it 's not . PAUL : Well , that looked interesting . Rachel had you follow me . She thought you might make a deal with Sarah behind her back . Well , Sarah 's off on a trip down memory lane . And so am I. What she finds there may be dangerous to us all , Paul . So I need you to come to me first . - Before Rachel . - I 'll be in touch . Right . So , how do we find Swan Man ? Mrs S has nice truck . Much like rooms . Helena , where are we going ? Cold River . What 's that ? A town ? A place of screams . You act like you 've never been in a car before . Never been on road trip . We 're clones . I can 't help but think that the godhead has put you here to test me . Wondering how a simple guy like me meets a girl like you - in a place like this ? - On the floor ! You knew all along . You 'rejust one of them , aren 't you ? Hello , Paul . Ripped By mstoll

 ( Animal roaring ) ( scrapes ) ( air hisses ) ( panting ) ( growling ) ( screams ) ( crunches ) ( man screaming ) ( roars ) - Hola , Javier . - Hola . - Como estas ? - Bien . Hey Z. ( Sighs ) You 're late . I am in a hurry . It 's good to see you too , buddy . Jesus . The charts are right over there . They 're all current . Business has been pretty good . You shouldn 't have a problem keeping the boat full . I have got eight for you for tomorrow morning . So be here at 9 : 00 sharp . Most of my luck 's been over at Los Arcos , but then I guess you know your way around the bay . Yeah , I guess I do . I have got no reception in the USA , so you 're on your own . Oh , how sad for me . Yeah , well , try not to screw things up , okay ? - Copy that . - See you in a couple of months . - All right . - Hey , and don 't sink the boat . Adios . You know , you still throw like a girl . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . ( Shouting and cheering ) ( chuckles ) What did you expect , the QE2 , huh ? - Hola carnal . - Hola bonito . Things must have gotten very bad for you to come back here , huh ? - It 's only temporary . - Oh . - It 's good to see you . Come on . - Good to see you too . Are you still playing the captain to the rich and the famous ? When I can find a ride , you know ? What about you ? No no , I am the man now . - Huh ? - Ay carajo . Ay carajo . And I need to see your papers . Yeah , that 's a good one . No , seriously . I need to see them . - All right , okay , El Capitan . - Sorry , bro . Things have changed , Trace , you know ? - You know Calderon , right ? - Yeah . He doesn 't allow any live-aboards around the area . Why does Calderon have a say ? He 's the captain of the harbor patrol now . ( Groans ) They 're really lowering the bar , huh ? Wow . 100 ton Master ? Yeah , check it out- - Yes ? I don 't really have anywhere else to stay . You think maybe you can just like ... Hey , Trace . ... look the other way for a couple of weeks ? Trace , Trace , listen . I can 't do it . No , that 's cool . I understand . Look , l- - here . I got something for you . Here you go . Is this a bribe ? No , it 's a late birthday present . Oh , yeah yeah yeah . - Wow . - It 's a bit of an aphrodisiac . You mean , for the ladies ? - Yes , the mamacitas . - Really ? Ah , thank you , thank you , thank you . ( Sighs ) Don 't let Calderon see you . I don 't want to lose my job . Dude , I owe you . Thank you . Thank you . Come on , have a beer with me . It 's still kind of warm . Eh , doesn 't matter . - Cheers . - Por la regreso . Simon . Come on . ( Screams ) FEMALE ANCHOR : In other news , no further contact with Jeremy Long II , the solo sailor lost last week in the Gulf of Alaska . Search and Rescue has been terminated due to weather and no further attempts will be made . What do you think happened ? The biggest danger for those solo sailors is falling overboard . Yeah , or going nuts . You two girls swimming to the reef today ? Aron spotted a whale shark on the north end last week . You be careful , okay ? They 're harmless . They don 't even have teeth . Stay to the south , okay ? You promise ? Thank you , Luis . Yes , Mamacita . ( Laughs ) Is this the immigration office ? I heard you were coming home . - Hola , mi nina . - Hola . Que pasa ? Como esta tu madre ? Still keeping me under house arrest . You finally got busted ? - Oh , please . - I am so sorry . - Hey . - Hey , look who the cat dragged in . - Hey , man . - How are you doing ? I have been running around . You doing all right ? - Doing good . Doing good . - Good . Captain Trace McGraw , back from the high seas . - Hola , mi loco . - How are you , man ? - I am good . - How 's the place looking ? Looks good , man . The walls are still standing . Hey , drinks ? - Yes . - Whatever 's free . - Not for you , man . - Let 's go sit down . Come on , man , you 're going to make me go bankrupt . TRACE : Hola . Pedro , tequila ? - Who is that ? - That 's my good friend Trace . Carol , meet my friend Trace , captain to the Fortune 500 . Trace , meet my friend Carol . Nice to meet you . She came in last year to teach at the international school . Oh yeah ? What do you teach ? Oh , I teach environmental science with a focus on aquatic ecosystems . Yeah , big words . Let 's drink . - Salud . - To Trace . - Cheers . - Cheers . TRACE : Gracias . Come on , man . You have always got a story when you come back . What 's the adventure this time ? Unfortunately , I don 't remember her name . No , for real . TRACE : For reals ? Okay . Well , actually recently I was- - I was chased by pirates . Yeah . I was doing a two-month gig , you know , piloting this boat to Kuala Lumpur and a pirate ship- - a speedboat came up across our bow and actually started firing at us . Next thing I know , they 're on board . And I had no choice . I had to rescue the women and I fired on them ... . ... . with my flare gun . And I hit him . - Probably in the ass , huh ? - Right in the arse . But they got scared off ... . ... . and sped out of there . Boss was watching C-SPAN the whole time . I will tell you this much- - there is no reward in being a glorified cabin boy . So I have returned home to make my fortune . Hey , compadre , come on . We all know you 're not going to make a fortune out of snorkeling . Simon , carnal . I guess I will just have to hunt for pirate treasure then . Trace , come on . We all know you . All you 're going to do is rob the local tourists . Come on . Isn 't that the idea ? - Come on , let 's have another drink . - Let 's do it . ( Phone ringing ) Everybody , want another drink ? - Yes . - Not you . I know how you get . - Rita ? - Sure . Looks like I just lost my first mate . Yeah . - Cheers . - Cheers . - Salud . - To Trace . Sure . I will see you in an hour . Sure . Bye . TRACE : Do you know Ernesto ? He 's running the harbor patrol now . He came by . - Rita , that was Michael Kirshner . - Yeah . He wants to meet in an hour regarding the water polo match . I will give you a call after the meeting , okay ? I am so sorry . Don 't worry about it . I will see you afterwards . And don 't let him push you around . He 's got bigger fish to fry than me . Anyway , thanks so much . I will try and make it , okay ? - Bye . - Bye . Nice to meet you . Okay , well , you guys , I am off to the beach . Whoa . Que onda ? I just got here . Are you going to leave already ? Want to go up to the point and catch up on old times ? Yes , I would love to go to the point and catch up on old times . How 's your boyfriend ? No estes chingando . I never would . - Okay , bye . - Bye . - Mine . - Get back . ( Chatting ) Whoo . - Good morning . - Carol for Michael . - Okay , go ahead . Thank you . - Thank you . Hola . Carol , good to see you , as usual . Thank you . Hey , thanks for rearranging your classes . Of course . ( Boat horn blows ) Wow . Beautiful , isn 't it ? So ... Yeah , well , I had this idea about the water polo match- - why don 't we do it right here , right in front of the marina ? What do you think ? Polo on the canal- - it 's a great backdrop , right ? My girls play in a pool . The channel is- - well , it 's just not designed- - Carol , listen . We have rearranged the entire program to feature the waterway . Your match would be the grand finale . But you have the boats and- - Don 't worry about the boats . I have arranged for all recreational traffic to be shut down during the time of the match . And I have got some patrol boats , so there 's no problem , nothing to worry about . I have to talk to the girls . And I can 't see how- - Carol , I am in a bit of a pinch here . I mean , I can understand your concerns and everything , but I was really hoping you 'd go along with me on this . I have already talked to the yacht club coach . They 're on board 100 % . I 'd hate to have to have them play against a different team . The girls would be crushed . Yeah . ( Sighs ) Okay . Okay , we will make it work . But I want you to promise me you will get those patrol boats . And I want the safety buoys too . ( Chuckles ) That was easy . Come on , let 's go to lunch . ( Computer beeping ) ( speaking Spanish ) ( screaming ) This is Search and Rescue X-ray-Tango-6-4-niner . Hailing all vessels . We have a distress signal located near Los Muertos Reef . Please proceed immediately to that location . ( Screaming ) ( crunching ) ( roars ) You are one intriguing woman- - a diving champ , biology major , Princeton grad . It does beg the question- - how did you end up working here ? Sentimental reasons , I guess . My parents had a fellowship at the Marine Institute in the ' 80s . Scientists . Both of them . They studied climate change here for a year . Can I interest you in any dessert , coffee- - anything ? No , thank you . I am fine . I will take an apple pie and a coffee . Thanks . Say , Carol , I was thinking maybe after the regatta you and I get together for a drink . Oh , no no no . It 's not what you 're thinking . To be honest , it is a proposition , but I wonder if you 're interested in coming to work here at Paradise Village as a social director . It 's a job at a family resort . You 're good with kids- - a good fit , right ? Can I think it over ? The drinks or the job ? ( Chuckles ) Maybe both . Well , look at the time . I am sorry . I am afraid I have to go . Thank you for lunch , Mike . Carol , this is a serious job offer . I really want you to consider this . I will . I will keep in touch . ( Exhales ) ( dialing ) ( phone ringing ) Hi . This is Rita . Please leave me a message . Thank you . ( Beep ) Rita , Carol here . Hey , let me know where you are at the beach , okay ? Bye . ( Whistle blows ) So , the match . The field will be laid out exactly the same , except the goalie won 't be able to touch the bottom . Eggbeater as long as you can . We will substitute every 10 minutes , okay ? Okay . All right , girls , give me a sprint to the goal then the drive-pass drill . Come on . ( Blows whistle ) Here . Here . Nice catch . ( Blows whistle ) Janelle , that 's a foul . - She should watch the ball . - You should watch your passing ... . ... . and your temper . Emilia , are you okay ? Yeah , I am okay . Don 't let her throw you off your game . - You 're doing great . - Okay . Hey , what 's the matter with you , Janelle ? ( Blows whistle ) That 's enough for the day . Shower up . ( Javier speaks Spanish ) Not today , thanks . Okay . Watch your step . There you go . You did good . Good job . MAN : Thanks , buddy . - Cheers . - Thanks a lot , man . Gracias . Don 't forget , we like the tips that jingle , but we love the tips that fold . ( Men laugh ) All right . Hola . Hey , Carol the aquatic eco coach . Trace the embellishing pirate . What brings you down here ? Oh , I was hoping Rita was here . I was supposed to meet up with her , but I can 't find her . Bienvenido a Mexico . Don 't take it personal . That 's just Rita . Maybe , but she was going for a swim . You don 't think I should be worried ? No , I am sure she 's fine . I am actually going to go and pick up some supplies , so if I see her , I will tell her to give you a call . Okay , maybe I will drive down to the beach and see if I can find her too . I am telling you , she 's fine . Okay , adios . Adios . MAN OVER RADIO : Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard , what is your location ? Over . Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard , this is Mexican Search and Rescue . Over . Please continue on a heading of 20 ° north by 105 ° west . Over . I don 't see anything . Search and Rescue , this is Vallarta Lifeguard . We 're approaching the reef , but there is nothing here . I repeat , there is nothing here . Roger that . Puerto Vallarta Lifeguard , this is Mexican Search and Rescue . Over . Please confirm your location as 20 ° north by 105 ° west . Over . LIFEGUARD : Roger that . I can 't make it out . Here , take a look over there . There , just below the surface . See it ? Whoa , what- - what is that thing ? I see it . Where did it go ? Try to find it . Check- - check over the bow . I got back here . What was that ? It 's not up here , man . I can 't see it . ( Growling ) What the- - ? ( Both scream ) - Help me . - Reach for my hand . I got you . ( Screams ) Bro . Come on , man , kick . ( Screaming ) ( creature roaring ) Mayday mayday mayday . Los Muertos Reef . Mayday . ( Dog barking ) Trace , you 're talking crazy , man . I am telling you , okay ? This was not a shark , okay ? A shark does not eat a lifeguard boat . A shark does not have horns . Hey , carnal , I know you 're upset about what you saw , but you can 't- - Luis ? Hey , why are you closed ? Trace is having a bad day . He saw two lifeguards get attacked by a tiger shark . It was not a tiger shark . Well , I am sorry to interrupt , but I still can 't find Rita and I am starting to get worried . Oh , don 't worry about her . REPORTER : Harbor patrol has impounded a vessel belonging to dive boat operator Bob Scranton ... - You want some water ? - Please . REPORTER : ... who specializes in bringing his clients up close and personal with sharks . Scranton has been chumming the waters around Los Muertos Reef , which Captain Calderon believes led to the fatal attack on two lifeguards and a local woman Rita Valdez . - Oh my God . - In making today 's announcement , Police Chief Captain Calderon thanked Dr. Frank Reeves for helping identify the cause of the threat . Next up , Randy Johnson with sports . This wasn 't a shark . Trace , just stop , all right ? What are you talking about ? I have sailed on this bay half my life . I know what a damn tiger shark looks like . I am going to find this thing that killed my friend . Trace ... I am coming with you . Rita was my first friend here . She worked at the administration at the school . For some reason she thought I needed a social life . Yeah , that sounds like Rita . She looked up my birthday and threw me a surprise party at Luis 's bar . I didn 't know a soul . That 's how friends were made , according to Rita , in PV . Seems like everybody 's got a story like that about Rita . What 's yours ? She fed me . ( Chuckles ) ( clears throat ) When we were kids , we both went to the same kind of- - it 's like an elementary school . We were , I don 't know , six or seven . I guess I was the poor kid with no lunch money . So every day Rita would come to school with an extra lunch . And that was the first time that I ever tasted food made with love . It was good . That thing is still out there . And until we can prove it , not Luis , not the news channels , not Calderon- - nobody 's going to believe us . I need your help . Rita was my best friend here . Yeah , mine too . Mine too . Well , here we are . - Come on , let me show you around . - Great . Wow . There is a certain wow factor . What a wonderful place , so peaceful and private . How about a drink ? You have really got this down , don 't you ? ( Chuckles ) Thank you . My pleasure . ( Bird squawking ) Viva Ia fiesta . And to think it was snowing when I left Aspen . ( Gasps ) Is that your boat ? What , that old thing ? Yeah . Will you take me for a ride sometime ? Sure . No problem . Let 's go for a dip first , work up an appetite for lunch . - Oh , I don 't need to eat . - Looking at you , neither do I. No no , Steve . Steve , I am serious . I do not want to get my bathing suit wet . No ? What are you waiting for ? The pool deck at the Paradise . ( Screams ) ( laughing ) I am going to get you for this . I am going to get you . ( Gasps ) There 's something down here . STEVE : What ? Help . Oh , come on , Lois , you 're not getting off that easy . No , Steve , help . Help . Lois . ( Screams ) ( Lois coughing ) ( grunts ) ( creature roaring ) You really know these waters , don 't you ? I sort of grew up down here . I spent more time in the water than I did in school . My dad was stationed at the US Navy base down here , so ... Didn 't follow in his footsteps ? Not exactly . I was at Annapolis , my father 's pride and joy . I don 't know . Something just didn 't click . I dropped out a year later . My father hasn 't talked to me since . Where is he now ? Somewhere in the States , I hear . I am sorry . Nothing to be sorry for . Not that it 's any of my business , but some people- - well , parents have a hard time adapting to how they thought things would be to how they are . I didn 't exactly take you for the black-sheep-in-the-family type . You 'd be surprised how high expectations can be set . The only thing I have learned to expect lately is bad news . What about your pot of gold ? I am still looking for it . You see that ? - What is it ? - I don 't know . It 's right here on the starboard side . Just keep the boat pointed right . - What is it ? - It 's called an EPIRB . It 's an emergency response beacon that 's triggered by water . If your boat sinks , it sends out a distress signal with your GPS coordinates . Every boat has one . Well , does it say what boat it 's registered to ? I don 't know . It 's got all this residue on it . Hold on , hold on , hold on . Let me see it . Be my guest . Fin Seeker , this is Mexican Search and Rescue . Over . In regards to your previous inquiry , the EPIRB belongs to the sailboat that disappeared off the coast of Alaska . Over . Repeat that . Did you say Alaska ? Over . Affirmative . Strange- - we got the same signal just before the lifeguards disappeared . I have no idea how it got this far south . Can you bring it by headquarters when you get a chance ? Over . Roger that . Over and out . Alaska ? That 's a long way . Yeah , it 's a long way . ( Sighs ) That 's it . That 's what I saw . I found it on Dr. Reeves ' website . Trace , these creatures have been extinct for over 150 million years . Well , I guess it didn 't get the memo , because that 's what I saw . Are you suggesting the species survived ? You 're the scientist . Suppose it did survive , just for the sake of the argument . A mutation more sustainable to warmer waters could be making its way south . This . came from that boat that vanished in Alaska . Now , five days later they picked up its signal here , okay ? That 's 1600 miles . You think this thing attacked Jeremy Long 's boat ? Yeah . And it swallowed his emergency beacon . Then it headed south to warmer waters . But it couldn 't digest the beacon , so it regurgitated it . So how do we kill it ? We have to go to the authorities with this . And tell them what ? As far as they 're concerned , this case is closed . I will talk to Dr. Reeves about it . He worked with my father . Dr. Reeves will hear me out . And he will think you are as crazy as I am . Well , I will take that chance . I am going to need this . The residue might be bile from its stomach . Dr. Reeves can sequence the DNA and confirm that this thing exists . Trace , promise me you won 't do anything until I have had a chance to talk to him . Trace . All right . Carol . Thanks . Dr. Reeves . Carol Brubaker . You spoke at my class last month . I remember . Carl Brubaker 's daughter . I always enjoyed his lectures . I am also a friend of Rita Valdez- - a woman killed at Los Muertos . I was wondering if I could have a moment of your time . Of course . Give me a moment . Here . Follow me . Trace recognized it immediately as the creature he saw . Carol , this is just an artist 's rendering . It 's on your website . Yes , but it 's just another unconfirmed sighting . There have been others ? Japan , New Zealand , North Carolina . But until we have a reliable record of the existence of this species , something concrete , we cannot assume the existence of a living example . This is the beacon I told you about . It may have tissue from the creature on it . Examine this please , Dr. Reeves . I Will . ( Quietly ) Trace , you promised . ( Groans ) ( computer beeps ) ( firing ) ( gun clicks ) ( phone clicks ) ( siren sounds ) MAN OVER LOUDSPEAKER : Stop your engine . Prepare for boarding . I repeat , stop your engine . Stop your engine . The engine 's stopped , okay ? I hear you . The engine 's stopped . CALDERON : Nothing changes with you , does it , McGraw ? TRACE : I know . It 's very sad . Entiendo . Hey , you want to explain to me why you were doing 10 times the speed limit through a no-wake zone ? Uh , no , actually I don 't . How about a registration for that weapon ? Look , Victor , I am very happy for your promotion and I am glad to see that they 're lowering their standards so much . And as much as I 'd like to stay here and insult you some more , I am kind of busy right now . Oh , can we get you any ammunition , huh ? How about some fuel ? - Look , Victor . - Yeah ? This thing- - this thing that killed Rita and the lifeguards- - it 's not just a shark , okay ? It 's some kind of prehistoric shark , like a dinosaur . - What the hell are you talking about ? - This thing is out there ... . ... and it 's headed towards the waterways . I saw it , okay ? ( Laughing ) I am not kidding , all right ? If we don 't stop this thing , it 's going to kill a lot more people . How long are you going to carry on with this bullshit ? Those people were attacked by a tiger shark . - No , it was not a tiger shark . - Yeah , and I have a warrant ... . ... . to Search this vessel . Search it for what ? You leave that to us . You know what ? Go ahead . Search the boat . Fine . Be my guest . You have got bigger problems than a prehistoric fish , amigo . It turns out your partner Zorra was arrested at the border with 40 pounds of marijuana . - Can you explain that to me ? - What partner ? He 's not my partner . I rent his boat . Okay , that 's it . That 's it . Now I am impounding this boat , okay ? Ernesto , get this fool off the deck and onto dry land . Yeah , good luck getting on board . ( Laughing ) All right , calm down . This is not a contact sport . Oh , come on , let 's go . All right . Are you kidding me ? - Wait , hold on . Hold on . - Fine . TOM : All right , let 's get out of here . Come on . JADE : All right , babe . All right , you be up front . I am in back . All you got to do is just row and I will match you , okay ? No big deal . Here we go . Here we go . One , two . Perfect . JADE : All right . Paddle paddle paddle . Right on , I have got this . Okay . And what is it that you 're doing back there , babe ? I am trying to match your stroke . Isn 't that supposed to be my line ? ( Jade laughs ) Come on . Left , right , left , right . Don 't make me come back there . Just keep in rhythm with me . Listen here , mister ... ( Tom laughs ) You 're rocking the boat . Tom , I think we 're being followed . It 's probably just a dolphin . I don 't know . It looks kind of big for a dolphin . That 's no dolphin . That 's a shark . Now row . Row . ( Whimpering ) - Come on . - Oh my God . Oh my God . TOM : Go . Jade , go . Go . ( Screaming ) Tom , no . ( Screaming ) ( singing in Spanish ) - I really want you to come with us . - That would be awesome . Hey . MAN : You guys are looking great . Good to see you . Dr. REEVES : Hello . Good to see you again . Sam , nice to see you once more . Thank you for your hospitality . Dr. REEVES : Very good . Hello . - Simon . - Ah , Frank . Frank , good to see you again . - I am glad you could make it . - Thanks for inviting me . - Let me introduce you to somebody . - Sure . - Elsa . - Yes ? This is Dr. Simon Otis , a distinguished colleague of mine . Well , welcome , Dr. Otis . I am so glad you 're joining us this evening . Simon is with us doing some research on cryobiology . I will let him explain . I study organisms living at below normal temperatures , endangered fish . Endangered fish . Excuse me one moment . I am so sorry that the music is so loud , but we are having our annual fiesta , and I am so glad you 're joining us for this event . Yes , well , it 's nice to be here . Amigos , your music is great , but could you hold the volume down just a little bit ? Some Arctic species develop antifreeze proteins ... . ... that bind to the ice crystals in the fish . Frank . Very interesting , Dr. Otis . It 's been such a pleasure meeting you . Nice to meet you . Frank , I must say hello to your wife . I will join you later . I was just telling her about the Siberian sturgeon ... . ... and how I was trying to freeze the DNA for future regeneration . I was going to- - Simon , come with me for a moment . I need your opinion about something . Okay . There 's been something bothering me for some time . I am checking up on this . I am not really certain as to what the answer is . But do you think it 's possible that a prehistoric species could survive in this way , trapped in ice ? I think it 's highly improbable . But out of the question ? No . ( Beeping ) ( sighs ) Where 's Trace ? I can 't get him on his cell . I don 't know . He probably got some last-minute customer or something . He 's out there looking for the pliosaur . I know it . What ? ( Phone rings ) Hello . Hello . Hey , Carol . It 's Mike . Listen , the regatta fiesta parade thingy- - it 's going to be happening a little bit later than anticipated . So I was wondering if we could delay the polo match till 3 : 00 . Sure . No problem . Okay , I will tell the yacht club coach . Okay , is that it ? Well , not unless you want to take me up on my offer- - dinner tonight ? Look , I don 't know how to explain this to you , Mike , but I just can 't deal with this right now , okay ? No , I totally understand that . I mean , tomorrow night 's good if you 're available . ( Groans ) Naely , doing anything tomorrow night ? ( Phone rings ) Hello . Where are you ? I am coming . It 's Trace . He 's down at the dock . Luis , that thing is in the canal . Everything was peaceful around here until Trace McGraw came back . You still don 't believe him ? Did you ? I believe what he saw was a pliosaur . I believe he saw it go to inland waters . And we have got to stop it . And I believe you guys are going to need my help . ( Boat horn tooting ) This is Steve 's house here . We should warn him . Yeah , there 's a good View of the canal from his dock . Steve . Hey , Steve . Steve . - Steve . - Steve . I don 't see him . Looks like he hooked another one . Yeah , looks like it . Steve . Hey , Steve . Are you okay ? It 's real , just like you said . Where the hell is it headed for now ? Let 's go . The canal leads to the Parque Nacional . That 's where it 's headed . - How far is it ? - 12 miles . But there 's a pontoon barrier at the Huatulco turn-off . - We can stop it there . - Then what ? Blow it out of the water . Whoa . This creature is a biological phenomenon . So ? We should capture is somehow , anesthetize it , study it . We will get it mounted on your wall if you want , after we kill it . I like his idea better . So what , we need explosives , right ? Yeah , I will try to get some from my friends at the army base . All right , make it happen . We will take Steve 's car . You guys track the thing . I will meet you at the barrier . WOMAN : Calderon . Not now . ( Knocks ) What is it ? You need to take this . Yeah . Inspector Calderon , it 's Carol Brubaker . There 's been another shark attack with two more victims . Where ? 33 Via del Sol . At least two people- - Steve Leggins and a woman . There 's not much left to ID . We 're tracking the thing inland . We 're going to try and stop it at the Huatulco turn-off . You have got to send some help right away . Immediately . That 's for sure . So he said he 's sending someone . This better work . Pedro . TRACE : Pedro , tu eres aqui ? Hey guys . Came to visit your friend ? How long is it going to take you to get that pontoon piece into place ? No se . Para que ? Pedro , please , can you get that crane running ? I was waiting for- - Pedro , no estoy bromeando . Look , I am not joking , man . We got to get that thing down , okay ? Just move it . Come on . Okay okay . ( Speaking Spanish ) Let 's go . - Be careful . - Okay . Pedro , keep bringing it down . ( Speaking Spanish ) Watch your step . Come on . Okay , that 's good . So what 's the plan ? There are eyelets on either side of this pontoon ... . ... that lock it into place . Once they 're together , this thing shouldn 't be able to get through . So how are you going to do that ? Unfortunately , I am going to have to go underneath there . What am I supposed to do ? Just make sure I don 't get eaten . That 's not funny . Okay , take it up . Come on . ( Bird screeches ) Got it ? Almost . I have just got to catch my breath . Carol , Carol . Carol , Carol . Carol , come on . Carol , come on . Carol , come on . Carol . MEN : Get her out . Let 's go . Carol . Get out . Come on . It 's coming . Get out . Get out . Hey . Hey , come on . Ernesto , look . We got it trapped inside the canal . You 're just in time , okay ? Look . Okay , stay back . What are you doing ? Victor , listen to me . We have it trapped right here in the canal , okay ? - Oh yeah ? - It 's right back there . Really ? How scary . ( Laughs ) - Listen to me . - No , listen to me , Trace . You show up out of nowhere and the next thing I know , I have got four people dead and a missing car ... . ... . and a brick of marijuana from your boat . We have it trapped . Now if you don 't do something- - - What do you want me to do , eh ? - I want you to stop this thing . You want me to pin it on a dinosaur ? Is your dinosaur running weed too , eh ? ( Creature roars ) ( people scream ) Fire , now . Whoa . ( Groaning ) ( screaming ) That 's your killer- - a 150-million-year-old shark . It 's hungry . We need to trap this thing . Okay , the waterway leads to a maze of canals ... . ... and then a swamp . The canals lead to the estuary . And the estuary leads to the open ocean , so this thing can still get free . Yeah , but the Mascaro is only a few boat lengths wide ... . ... and it 's shallow . I have got a chopper . We can spot it from the air ... . ... . and blow this thing back into the Stone Age . - Ernesto , call the base now . - Yes , sir . And clear the park . Dinoshark season is officially open . Hey , you see that boat ? I am going to take that boat , okay ? I will meet you- - Hey , look , Trace , I want you to stay out of the way , okay ? Leave it to us . ( Helicopter blades whirring ) That chopper 's got a .50-caliber machine gun . No arguing with that , man . MAN OVER RADIO : We have the shark spotted right below . ( Men screaming ) Holy shit .

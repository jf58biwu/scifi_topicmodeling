 Locked in combat with three suspected Human Liberation Front Landmates ! Request immediate reinforcements ! I need backup ! Damn it ! Now you 'll see what we local police are made of ! C 'mon . How long do we hafta let the regular cops have their playtime ? Willfully ignoring preventable damage and injuries seems a lot like aiding and abetting to me . Quit griping . Lance is busy winning over the ladies at the Admin Bureau . 01 to all members . Switch from Shift C to A at once . See ? Speak of the devil and all that . 109 . Are you ready ? I could hardly wait ! You 're not to fire at all until you 've reached the destination . The residential sector is nearby . Expect a mountain of paperwork if so much as a single bullet strays . then you give us tall orders ... Respond ! 109 . I 'll try not to shoot . This is 45 . but it appears they 've been modified for urban use . Stay sharp . How polite of you . Ick . You get shot up a little and suddenly you 're one tough girl ... I hate that macho kind of mindset . I hope ? Oh ? Are you suddenly more perceptive ? geez . You 're no different from terrorists if you think the ends justify the means . I 'm just kidding . I 'm done being a spitfire who ignores orders . Found ' em . at 11 o 'clock . now descending ! Come out quietly ! The use of Landmates on public roads makes you an armed threat ! This is 109 . as planned . Now taking up pincer formation ! An ambush ? ! One got away ! I 'm on it ! That is what a pincer attack 's for ! Deunan . You assessed the risk of a ricochet and went with a knife instead . That was the apt choice . Wow . Baxter and Briareos praising me ... a sudden rain shower ? 01 to all members . Operation complete . Prepare to withdraw . 109 . That was a truly efficient and effective finish . Never mind rain ; I think there 's going to be a full-blown storm . knock it off ! What 's up ? it 's almost like the city 's alive . it just keeps transforming and regenerating until it 's regained its spark of life . There are many scholars who 'd argue that the entire planet is a life form of its own . It 's not strange at all that you 'd see it that way . we should probably hurry and call Hitomi and Yoshitsune . You sure they didn 't get sick of waiting and leave already ? assemble in the briefing room immediately . I have mission orders that need to be given to you in absolute secrecy . You gotta be kidding me ... What ? ! You 're canceling last-minute again ? ! too ! I even made us boxed lunches ... Fine ! Whatever ! now . You know ES.W.A.T. has to work around the clock . I don 't care how busy they are ! then forget it ! then you have to eat all their food ! - Huh ? - Don 't give me " huh " ! H-Hey ! Start eating already ! Y-You can 't be serious ! We 're not going home 'til you 're done eating it all ! I 'm sure you all remember the incident in which the multi-legged turrets went berserk . the Gaia Computer has since undergone repeated tests and maintenance . the Legislative Bureau feels this isn 't enough and has requested a regular examination of Gaia as well . Those old geezers are such worriers . Umm ... So what exactly does that mean ? it means giving Gaia a health checkup . A computer ... getting a health checkup ? they have given strict orders that this checkup be conducted under ES.W.A.T. ' s supervision . I imagine this will be a bit different than a normal mission . all of you . Hey . When does our mission start ? I already told you ... once Gaia 's done talking with Tartaros . And I wanna know when that 'll be ... How should I know ? I bet Gaia doesn 't wanna do these stupid experiments either . And now it 's complaining . I got it ! What if this is actually some type of machine uprising ? ! I apologize for the wait . Gaia 's dialogue has finally finished . Shall I allow it to conclude now ? Okay . Do it . with this timing ? Surely you haven 't forgotten about the time the Gaia Computer malfunctioned and used multi-legged gun turrets to launch a massive assault on Tartaros because it doubted the loyalty of all bioroids . But all the turrets were later destroyed and replaced with new model Auto Insectors . but the brain controlling them is still the same . The most recent malfunction incident wasn 't due to a flaw with the turrets . it was because Gaia is honest to a fault . It 's just ... I 'm bothered by the idea of leaving Gaia with the decision of how to deal with the suspicion directed at itself . You think Gaia will be wary of people 's suspicions ? Gaia is still just a machine . huh ... though ? we 're on duty ! Don 't act so relaxed ! I can 't help it . This is so boring . He calls it the biggest mission of the year and then has us just sit around while a computer gets a checkup ? ! Don 't be like that . we finally get some time off . The Legislative and Admin Bureaus are worrying too much . My guess is the Admin Bureau is making good on some hard-line deal they made in the past . either . He should put himself in our shoes . We 're the ones who get sent out . I got it ! What do you say we order some pizza and beer and down it all ? ! you know ! So ? I don 't care ! Let 's have some fun ! What was that ? ! I 'm not sure ! The monitors blacked out for a second and then I suddenly lost all access privileges ! Whoa ! This thing 's acting on its own ! Send a shutoff signal ! Right now ! No good ! All external input is cut off ! Seal all shutters immediately ! it 'll be a repeat of the turret incident ! All the security Landmates in the building are powering up ! We 're not the only people here ? ! They 're prototype models designed for unmanned operation . It appears their emergency power sources have activated . So Gaia 's taken full control of the building ... I can 't think of anything that could be worse than this . is it ? Deunan . I hate to say it but this is going to be much worse than just a storm . To think Gaia would malfunction during a diagnostic check ! That was just asking for trouble . at that . 01 to all members . It appears Gaia has purposely cut the comms system . The situation inside the dome is completely unknown . and stop the Auto Insectors . copy ! copy ! copy ! Ammo ? Two magazines left . That makes me feel uneasy . - Take this . - Thanks . These and those jumbo-sized ones are running off this place 's reserve power . Our only option is to infiltrate the command center and cut the power feed . will we have enough ammo ? Olympus will fall . we 'll have piles of written apologies to send . but we can 't afford to let them get out . We won 't let them . Let 's tear our way through ! Sounds good to me . or are they somehow anticipating our actions ? It feels like they 're taking countermeasures against us . Guess we aren 't the only ones who don 't want to repeat our screw-ups . It 's too quiet ... Could be a trap . we have no choice but to jump headlong into it . we gotta keep pushing ahead . I 'll take the lead . Keep running and don 't look back . I 'll cover you from behind . Tough customers ! But that is the quickest way inside . one way or another ... - Briareos ! - Get back ! - Deunan ! - Right ! Talk about a close call . All the wires and switchboards are emitting the same amount of heat . Meaning its camouflaged which wires will cut the power to the Auto Insectors ? An admirably thoughtful act for a machine . It 's designed to alter its internal command structure and energy pathways in the event of an external attack . I can determine what it 's thinking from the change in its power flow . That 's my Briareos ! There . What 's wrong ? Seems my fingers are numb after that hand-to-hand battle earlier . - You shoot it . - Huh ? There 's only one shot left . I can 't risk wasting it . All right . Ouch ! We 're going into action too ! So it 's finally a full-scale war ... We 're the last line of defense . - Close-quarters combat ! - Roger ! About time ! Olympus is done for ... Get me the Chief . What the hell ? ! I 'd never screw up like that ! It 's your avatar . There 's no point in complaining about it . Slipping on a banana peel is so old and clich√© ! It 's a simulation Gaia made based on your past actions . - There 's some believability to it . - You 're terrible ! what was with all those bananas that suddenly appeared ? The details are unclear . It appears to be referencing the data history of a cleaning robot that was in the residential zone the other day . I assume it was a bug . it seems we weren 't the only ones unhappy with how this simulation played out . so it was Gaia 's idea of a joke ? That 's a machine for you . No sense of humor at all . What an unendearing way to sulk . You 're all back on your standard schedules starting tomorrow . We 'll be conducting physical training based on today 's results . so as to further improve Gaia 's opinion of ES.W.A.T. That is all ! No time off again ? ! You monster ! You cretin ! Briareos . What do you think we would 've done if we really had lost this city ? or go back to living in the ruins ... Why do you ask ? Are you thinking of quitting ES.W.A.T. or something ? No . I 've just been thinking about what my idea of paradise is ever since all that happened ... I think it might be family . huh ... A daily life with a partner at your side who you can talk about even the most insignificant things with . it 's actually very precious . even today 's simulation might 've been helpful in reconfirming what normal life should be like . I see . let 's head back home . y 'know ? No objections !

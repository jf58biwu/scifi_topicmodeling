 Previously , on Fringe ... Walter . I lost the people I loved most , and I imagine you miss them too , the people you 've left behind . Yes , I do . I will help you get home . You okay ? Yeah , I just started to get another migraine . I was hoping I wouldn 't need these anymore . She 's not gonna remember the last two hours . When she wakes up , she 's gonna have one hell of a headache . I have come to tell you something . Olivia ... Who the hell are you ? How did you know my name ? I have looked at all possible futures , and in every one , the result is the same . You have to die . That 's him . Are you sure ? They all look like the same man . No , that 's the one . We 've been looking at these people for three years . Why did they make contact now ? I don 't know . But he knew my name , he knew who I was , and he knew where to find me . And then he just vanished . What exactly did he say ? He said that he had seen all possible futures , and in every one , I had to die . I had Astrid run a sample of his blood . There was no match on the DNA , but she did find antibodies for the Spanish flu . The Spanish flu ? Isn 't that extinct ? Well , the last recorded epidemic was in 1919 . Which makes them a minimum of 91 years old . I 'm going to assign you a security detail . I don 't think that that 's necessary . He threatened you . I 'm not sure that 's what he was doing . I--I think that he was trying to warn me . If he approaches you again , I expect you to notify me right away . Of course . Excuse me . Do you know her ? No . Oh , God . Is that supposed to be you ? Ah , she 's talented . Twisted , but talented . Why would anyone draw something like that ? Well , she 's a teenager . Isn 't that what they do ? Play depressing music , and think about how everything sucks , and then try and make everyone else as miserable as they are . It 's a stage . Stage or not , that 's creepy . Hey , look out ! Get those people back ! ♪ Fringe 4x10 ♪ Forced Perspective Original Air Date on January 27 , 2012 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ♪ In my timeline , I can interact with the machine , but since I 'm not supposed to exist here , it wouldn 't respond to me . It will require a biomechanical interfacing machine , calibrated specifically to your DNA . So you can operate it . You 've done it before , Walter . You can do it again . Good morning . Hello , Olivia . We 're discussing cis-acting meiotic double-strand break hot spots . Don 't worry , Olivia , I have no idea what he 's talking about either . What he 's talking about is finally trying to get me back home . I heard that Walter 's going to help you . I had to see you with my own eyes . Oh , don 't worry , Agent Dunham . This won 't interfere with my usual work , I assure you . If you need me , I will give you my full attention . It 's okay , Walter . I 'm just happy that you two are working together . I can 't say you 're gonna get his full attention , per se . He 's a little wired up today . He 's already electrocuted himself three times . Which reminds me , I can 't feel my urine response yet . I should probably go empty my bladder again . Dunham . - Hey . - This is a weird one . It seems a crane operator lost control of an I-beam , which was then tragically introduced to a Robert Englehart . And ? A few moments before he was killed , someone handed Mr. Englehart a sketch depicting him being skewered by that same I-beam , as if his death was predicted . You still there ? Okay , so the person who- - who gave him the sketch , what did he look like , was he bald ? No , it was a she . A teenage girl . A coworker of the victim was with him at the time . She thinks she could I.D. the girl if she saw her again . All right , well , we need to collect all the surveillance from the area . I 'm already on it . There you are . Where have you been all afternoon ? Just around . Well , you know you 're supposed to call when you 're gone this long . Sorry . I met that kid in 3-C today . Hey , guys . Dad 's home . - Perfect timing . - Dinner 's almost ready . Hey , buddy . Hi . - So how did it go today ? - Well- - The interview was great . I start tomorrow . That 's great . Looks like the view from the lake house . You miss it , don 't you ? Dad , aren 't you tired of moving us all around so much ... Because of me ? Doesn 't matter where we are . All that matters is we 're together . Why did God make me like this ? You know how I feel , em . God has a purpose for all of us . Even if we can 't understand it . But I do know mine is to take care of you guys . Hey , at least it hasn 't happened in a while . Let 's , uh , keep these curtains closed at night , okay ? All right . You get some sleep . I 'll see you in the morning . I love you , Dad . I love you too , Angel . Any luck ? Agent Dunham . Were you able to I.D. the girl who drew the picture ? Not yet . Lincoln 's with the witness at the moment , looking at footage from traffic and surveillance cameras in the area . What ? I got a call from Health Services . You 've been three times in the last month ? You checking up on me ? I 'm your commanding officer . They tell me these things . Migraines . I needed a prescription , which is why I went to Health Services . Headaches , that 's all . Do you believe in fate , sir ? No . I don 't . Neither did I. But this drawing ... How is it the day after a complete stranger tells me I 'm going to die , I end up investigating a case where the victim 's death is predicted ? I mean , maybe- - that man from the opera house- - maybe he does know something . Just for the next few days ... Maybe we should be vigilant . Keep you out of harm 's way . Good news . Robert Englehart 's coworker just I.D.ed the teenage girl from surveillance tapes . We got a good image from the bank across the street from the cafe . Okay , so do we know where she went ? We know where she didn 't go . Surveillance showed her bypass the 8th Street bus stop , she also walked right by the subway entrance . Okay , so there 's a good chance that she lives somewhere in the area . Maybe she goes to school nearby . Stop the bus ! I tried . Wait , 6 / 8 is the same as 3 / 4 ? Right . You keep dividing the fractions in half , till you can 't without changing the denominator . No offense , Mom , but I understand this way better when Emily explains it . Uh , good morning , sir . Ma 'am , sorry to bother you . I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham , this is Lincoln Lee . We work for the FBI . What can I do for ya ? We 're looking for this girl . We 've been going door to door , asking people if they know her . One of your neighbors said she might live in the building . No , I don 't think so . What 's her name ? We don 't know . Do you mind if I ask who else lives here with you , Mr ... Mallum . Jim Mallum . It 's just my wife Diane and our son . Danny , come here . You see this girl around ? Wait , is she the one we see at the park every so often ? I think so . Yeah . That 's Tanner Park . It 's about four blocks over . You might want to try looking for her around that area . Thank you . You 've been very helpful . I wish I could offer more . - Did you happen to notice the cabinet ? - No , why ? Red backpack , same one she 's wearing in the picture . So why did he lie to us ? As soon as we get back to HQ , I 'll get the paperwork started on getting a warrant . Maybe we won 't have to . Uh , hi . I 'm Olivia Dunham , and this is Lincoln . We both work for the FBI . It 's okay , you 're not in any trouble . We just want to talk . Did you draw this ? Is he dead ? Yes , but I think you already knew that . How ? How were you able to draw this before the accident ? I don 't know . I just see it ... In my head ... Whenever I 'm around someone who 's gonna- - I just sense it . You just sense what ? Death . That drawing ... Did you see something else that 's gonna happen ? Maybe we can stop it . Emily ! - Get in the house . - Mr. Mallum- - You can 't question her without parental consent , and I 'm not giving it . You lied to us . Actually , sir , we don 't need your consent . It 's up to Emily whether or not she wants to talk to us . Emily . Do you want to continue to answer these agents ' questions ? No . There 's your answer . Come on , Em . Let 's go . Let me ask you something . You think you 're the first people to come after my daughter ? It always starts this way . Authorities show up when they get wind of a girl with her ... ability . Then others come who want to study her , like those people at Massive Dynamic . Massive Dynamic ? And they never stop . No matter where we go , they find her . Watching from their cars , waiting for the right moment to grab her , take her to their labs . They poke and prod her like she 's some kind of animal . You have any idea what that does to a young girl ? Please ... Let my daughter have the chance at what 's left of a normal childhood . My number 's on the card . If you change your mind and want to talk , or if you and your family are being harassed , I think I can help . Okay , when we get back to the office , can you run a background check on the Mallums ? See what we can find out . I 'm gonna pay a visit to someone . Listen , you did the right thing out there . If it 's happening again , no one can know . It puts us all at risk . Dad , I saw something else . On the bus . Something awful . I 'm sorry , sweetie , but you know how this works . Even if you told ' em , would it make a difference ? Remember what they did to you when we tried to help before ? Trust me , okay ? It 's better this way . I 'd certainly like to see the results for that . Sooner rather than later . Yeah , well , send them to me directly . What a nice surprise . If I 'd known you were coming , i would 've canceled my lunch . Hi . Uh , I 'm actually here about Emily Mallum . Her father says that Massive Dynamic has been harassing her and her family . Oh , are you asking me a question , or are you accusing me of something ? Well , I thought you said that you were done using children as test subjects . Yes , we are . Massive Dynamic did approach the Mallum family when they lived in Baltimore . Emily exhibited some fascinating precog abilities that would 've allowed us to make drastic advances in our study of the human brain . We simply wanted to catalog her abilities . Her father wasn 't interested , even when we offered to pay for Emily 's schooling . I don 't know how you could 've raised me for so many years , and seen all the damage that was done to me , and pretend that there 's nothing wrong with what you just said . Olivia , I am sorry . Now , what happened to you was awful . But this girl is different . No one made her this way . I don 't see the difference . I mean , it 's still abuse . Dunham . It 's Emily . You said you wanted to help , Agent Dunham . Can you meet me ? Can you hold on one moment ? I 'm sorry , I have to go . Emily ? You picked a nice place for us to meet . It reminds me of a place we used to live . A better time . I sometimes sneak out here to think . To clear my head . Does your father know that you called me ? So what did you want to tell me , Emily ? I think a lot of people are gonna die . It started when I was 11 . I was in a pet store with my mother . We were looking at puppies , when suddenly I heard this hum . I thought something was wrong with my ears , like you know how sometimes after you 've flown in an airplane , but then , when we were leaving , the man behind the counter had a heart attack . I saw it in my mind before it happened . That was the first time . How long before it happened again ? A few months . I heard the hum during class , and an image popped into my head . My teacher lying dead in the street , covered in broken glass . Three days later , she got hit by a car . My parents took me to a doctor , but- - and then people started to do tests on me . And my friends heard about it . And that 's when people got scared ? And then you moved . The first time . But it kept happening . Hmm . Fascinating . The theta-one waves in your occipital lobe are remarkably active . And also , your brain seems to be drawing elevated levels of both oxygen and blood . Meaning what , Walter ? Belly and I always had a theory that some traumatic events echo backward in time . Put simply , some future events ripple backwards . Well , not in a way that we 're consciously aware of , but it 's sort of like vibrations . And perhaps your brain is uniquely sensitive to these vibrations . So it 's possible that 's the hum that you hear . Have you ever been able to control this ability ? That 's not how it works . These images I see ... They 're like dreams . At first they 're vivid , but then they fade . That 's why I draw them . But it wouldn 't matter anyway . Whatever I see ... Somehow it always happens . I know all these people are gonna die , but there 's nothing I can do to stop it . I don 't understand , Emily . Why do you warn them if they can 't do anything about it ? I don 't know . I guess if people knew , maybe they could say " I love you " to someone . Or just do one good thing . Maybe we can I.D. this man . She said she saw him on the bus . I 'll check the MBTA database . If he has a bus pass , they might have his photo . I haven 't thanked you for calling . That must 've been hard . Can I ask you a question ? Are you sensing anything now ? Like , here with me ? Emily . Dad . We called him . We didn 't want your parents to worry when you didn 't come home . Did they hurt you ? Mr. Mallum ... You don 't need to worry about us . Even if we 've never been able to stop it , let them at least try . We got something . Astrid found him . She got an address . According to his bus pass , his name is Albert Duncan , he 's got an apartment in Jamaica Plain . - Let 's go . - And then what ? Even if you can save Mr. Duncan , what about the rest of the people in that drawing ? I don 't know . But we 're certainly not gonna help anything by standing here . Thank you . Can my daughter and I please go home now ? If there 's nothing more she can do for you . No , I think actually there is . Walter , I think you can hypnotize Emily to recover her vision of the event in that drawing . Wh--wh--what makes you think I can do that ? Because where I 'm from , I 've seen you do it before . So is Albert in some kind of trouble ? We really don 't know . Sure , I understand . I wouldn 't tell me either . Hey . Uh , Mr. Duncan isn 't home yet . He works construction . We called his boss , and apparently he 's been away all week . How 's it going there ? Walter 's just getting started . Emily , I 'm going to count backwards from three . And when I reach one , I want you to open your eyes , and tell me where you are . Three ... Two ... One . Where are you , Emily ? On the bus . On the way home . Do you see Mr. Duncan ? No . But I hear it . I hear the hum . Look around , Emily . Find Mr. Duncan . I see him . He 's getting off the bus . Guide her , Walter , you can do this . Uh--um , Emily , listen ... Don 't let Mr. Duncan get away . You 'll have to catch up with him . Can you do that ? Yes . Follow him , Emily . We need to know where he 's going . What is it ? Oh , God . Where are you ? I don 't know . But it 's bad . Oh , God . They 're dead . They 're all dead . Look around , Emily . Describe what you see . Tell me where you are . I 'm scared . There 's nothing to be frightened of . Nothing can hurt you . You know what , Mr. Mallum , maybe if she heard your voice , it might help her . Sweetheart , it 's me . Look around . Tell me what you see . - I see something . - It looks like Latin . " Dei judicium fiat justitia . " " By the judgment of God , let justice be done . " Mm-hmm . I need to borrow your phone , please . Dunham . It 's me . It 's a courthouse . It 's happening at a courthouse . Peter , Albert Duncan just got divorced . The settlement was last week . He lost custody of his kids . Maybe he 's not so happy about it . When I count to three , I want you to wake up . I see him . I see Mr. Duncan . He 's holding something . Some sort of weird-looking radio . I don 't think it 's a radio . I think it 's a detonator . Duncan 's not the victim . He must be setting up some kind of bomb . Move , move move ! Go ! Move ! Courthouse security office pulled surveillance of Albert Duncan 's vehicle entering the south entrance of the parking garage 20 minutes ago . We 'll assume he 's still in the building . What about the bomb ? Given the amount of destruction in Emily 's vision , we assume that he couldn 't possibly have that amount of explosives strapped to his person . The way Emily described it , it was as though the ground erupted . Right , so we 'll assume the explosive is in the parking garage beneath the building . Bomb squad 's about to go in and look for it . Peter 's gonna join them . I can help . Sir , we 're ready . Go . We 'll start evacuating the building . Dad , I 'm sorry . Calling the FBI , I know I should 've told you . It 's okay , sweetheart . I 'm just really proud of you . But you 're in the system now . You know , so it 's only a matter of time before people start- - No . They 're not like that . Agent Dunham promised . She said no one would harass us anymore . Come on , let 's get in the house , Em . - Dad . - This isn 't a discussion . Go pack your bags . Diane ! Dad , please . What ? What is it ? Black van across the street . Just like the one in Baltimore . Do what your father says . I need a pen . I want to write down the license plate . Uh , excuse me . I 'm looking for Judge O 'Malley . The judge is in chambers . Do you have an appointment ? Uh , no , but um ... Ladies and gentlemen , due to a reported emergency , please proceed immediately to the nearest exit . Please remain calm , and obey the instructions of court officers . What do you got , boy ? What do you got ? 26 and 28 are clear . What about the wheel well ? Hey , I got it ! If you see him , I don 't want you to confront him . Just keep your eyes on him , and you can either let Agent Broyles or myself know . Okay . Thank you . It 's me . We were right . It 's rigged up to some sort of remote detonation trigger . Well , how long will it take to disarm ? They don 't know yet , but it 's pretty elaborate . Okay , keep me informed . Will do . They found the bomb ? This thing goes off , we 're gonna need to clear a 200-meter blast radius . Maybe you should help the police set up a perimeter . I know what you 're doing , and I 'm not going anywhere . Olivia ... What that man said to you ... That you 're gonna die ... Maybe this is what he was talking about . I can 't live my life like that . Or do my job . There 's no reason for you guys to be here . This thing 's wired with multiple redundancies . Could take hours . That guy could remote-trigger the device any time . Hey , can you tell me what frequency that bomb is rigged to receive ? Probably . Yeah , why ? What are you thinking ? Hey , it 's me again . Have everybody turn their radios to 432.5 megahertz . Hey . Hey , Judge O 'Malley ! You don 't even know who I am . No , no . Should I ? You took my family from me . And I 'm gonna take you away from yours . It 's over , Mr. Duncan . We blocked your signal . Nobody wants to hurt you , so you can just put your hands up , and we 'll just walk out of here . No . Nobody 's going anywhere . Albert , you do not want to do this . Don 't . He ... He took everything from me . Okay , I understand why you 're upset . But you can 't do this . You can 't . Albert ... This is not my fault . This is because of him . And this is how it has to end . No , you 're wrong . Nothing has to happen . Nothing is written in stone . You and I- - we don 't have to die here today . Now , whatever happens next is up to you . You are in control . I 'm not ready to die today . I don 't think that you are either . Think about all these people . They have children too . We 're not home . Please leave a message . Uh , Mr. Mallum , this is Olivia Dunham . We defused the bomb . A lot of people 's lives were saved today . I thought Emily would like to know . Hey , Em . Jim ? Jim , what is it ? They took her . They took Emily . We traced the plate number Jim Mallum provided . Boston PD hailed it . It was just a dry-cleaning van . Thanks for letting us know . Her father was wrong . I think he was just being paranoid . I don 't think Emily was abducted at all . Then where the hell is she ? I think I might know . Emily ! Emily ! You 're freezing cold . We have to get you out of here . Her pulse is weak . I 'll call the ambulance . Help 's on its way . It doesn 't matter . There 's nothing anyone can do . It 's just my time . This is Agent Lincoln Lee . I need an ambulance at park right away . No , Emily , you told me what 's in your drawings is inevitable . But you 're wrong . Today we saved all of those people because of you . Emily . Oh , God . Emily ... I 've known for a while . Why didn 't you tell me ? I knew you 'd be here . Em , please . They 're on their way . Can you just hold on ? I think you were right . Everyone has a purpose . They saved those people today . Maybe that was mine . Hey . Hey . They told me what happened with the girl . I 'm really sorry . They said it was some kind of stroke . Yeah . The overload of electrical activity in her brain was just too much . So the very thing that gave her her ability ... Also killed her . Walter said that even if we 'd known , we couldn 't have done anything to prevent it . He says , " a candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long . " I 'm guessing you 're not finding that all that comforting right now . No , not as much as he does . Is that an observer ? Is that what you call them ? Yeah , why ? What do you call ' em ? Well , up until now we haven 't called them anything . Things really are different here . What do you know ? Well , they show up at significant events all through history . Well , how do they do that ? Like some kind of time travel ? No , it 's not really time travel , per se . Uh , it 's more like they exist in all times simultaneously . They don 't experience time the same way that you and I do . So they know what 's going to happen . I mean , if one of them said something about the future ... Could they be wrong ? Well , no , I don 't really see how they could . They don 't predict the future , Olivia . They 've already experienced it . Did one of them make contact with you ? Have they reached out ? No . I hope it 's not too late . No , I , uh ... I just got home . Come in . I wanted to see you . Especially after I spoke with Phillip . He told me what happened to the girl . Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Really , I-I-I- - I am okay . Sweetheart , about what you said when you came to see me this afternoon ... I never should 've reacted the way that I did . I 'm sorry , I should not have accused you . Please , I-I 'm the one that needs to apologize . What happened to you as a child was unconscionable . You 've come so far , I just forget sometimes how much you 've been expected to forgive . I 'm not angry with you . I thought I was going to die today . And one of the things that I kept thinking was that you- - you wouldn 't know how I felt . You 're the closest thing I have to a mother . And I love you . Oh , Olive ... What ? What 's wrong ? I 've just been getting these migraines , that 's all . It 's really not that big of a deal . Well , do you have any medicine ? Yeah , my doctor gave me some . Good . And what about food ? Have you eaten ? No . I 'm going to make you some soup . You know , y- - you don 't have to do that . I want to . I 'm the closest thing you have to a mother . Remember . Thank you . That would be great . Tomorrow I 'm going to send some medication over . It 's a new drug we 've been working on . It 's remarkable . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

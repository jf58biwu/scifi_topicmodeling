 License ? Exterminator , huh ? Yeah . Boron trifluoride ? Methylene chloride ? Pretty serious stuff . What are you trying to kill anyway ? Whatever they tell me to . A medium cappuccino , dry , one and a half shots , not two . Name ? Jano - - J-A-N-O . Anton . Medium cappuccino , dry , one and a half shots . Anton ? Anton ? This yours ? Why you call me this name ? The computer says it 's for Anton . Hello . Take your cappuccino before it gets cold , Anton . Who is this ? Someone who knows who you really are . I just texted you an address . Bye . Hey . You have 30 minutes to get there . Otherwise , I introduce the Chechens to your new wife and baby boy . It 's all in the back , everything you asked for . Do what I told you to do . Okay ? So I 'm done here , all right ? Think of your child , Anton . With one keystroke , I can unleash an army of beasts to descend on him . It 's 9 : 58 . You said I could have my brain back by 10 : 00 . - Well , that gives us two minutes . - The chip is situated in HDAC 5 . That 's the genetic nucleus that regulates emotion . We have to be sure that there are no anomalies . Have you been experiencing any mood swings lately ? Crying fits ? Crying fits ? No . Well ... your amygdala is telling me a whole different story . Gabriel ... you know you 're safe in here . Oh , come on . Hey , hey . - We 're not judging . - Guess what . It 's 10 : 00 . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! Come on , now , wait . Sit it down there , Palio . Come on . Now , this is serious stuff we 're doing here . Your emotions are important . They 're critical . In fact , you are still incorporating the chip a little bit more every day . And while it will continue to make you more powerful , we must be certain that you remain you . What do you mean ? The chip will always exceed your human abilities . We can never let it exceed your humanity . We 've got a situation , gentlemen . C-Doc in 10 . You heard her . No , no , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Wires . The wires . Wires . The man on the left is Vincent Canello , a bag man for the Sebastiani crime family put into Witness Protection after testifying against them . U.S. marshal 's office in Phoenix says he went off their grid three days ago . Man on the right is Anton Radic , a Chechen chemist . Radic cooked Sarin for the sabotage battalion before giving them up . Also in Witness Protection . You 're wondering what they have in common . Ah , it 's the old " Mafia bag man and Chechen chemist walk into a bar . " The Chechen chemist - - I am gonna stop talking now . Sorry . Until 24 hours ago , these two men didn 't know each other , and now they 're working together . How 's that possible ? Good question . Canello 's cover in WITSEC was as a licensed exterminator . No irony there . The license allowed him to purchase a number of restricted chemical agents , which he did in Tempe , Arizona , day before yesterday . 200 gallons of methylene chloride , 90 pounds of tetrodotoxin . With the right compounding , he could devastate a city with these agents . One of them can buy the stuff . The other one knows what to do with it . So , who put these two together ? Would have to be somebody who had access to the Witness Protection database . An inside job ? D.O.J. says no . The system was infiltrated from the outside . Whoa , whoa , whoa , you 're talking about the most sensitive database in law enforcement . And that would take some serious ninja hack-fu . - We 've got a rider out there , and we have to find him . - Who ? A rider ? Every stick-and-carrot op has four basic elements - - the rider , a mule , a stick , and a carrot . The rider that got into the WITSEC database has a huge stable of mules . Mostly criminals themselves . And what 's the stick ? Exposure to the people they testified against . What about the carrot ? The most powerful leverage there is - - the opportunity to protect the people you love from a credible threat . Folks , we need to find this guy quickly . Methylene chloride , phosphate , tetrodotoxin . These chemicals have a half-life . They degrade quickly . If they were purchased the day before yesterday , he 'll have 48 hours before they 're useless . Looks like we 're going to Arizona . San Francisco . How do you know that ? The van has a bar code . I 've chipped every tunnel and bridge west of the Mississippi . That van crossed the golden gate bridge this morning . Cassidy , Jameson , Nelson , you 're on the hacker . Gabriel , Riley and I are going to San Francisco . Wheels up in an hour . Lillian 's coming ? Her daughter lives in San Francisco . One of our nation 's most decorated soldiers . He 's a hero , and now our country 's most secret weapon . Gabriel possesses a rare genetic mutation that allowed us to implant a microchip in his brain . We connected his mind directly to the information grid . It 's something the chip does that nobody expected . I can create a virtual snapshot of an event in my mind and then walk through it . It 's like a virtual evidence wall . At U.S. Cyber Command , we created a highly specialized unit around him ... Satellite in five . ... and assigned an agent to protect him . Run ! He 's the first of his kind - - the next evolution of intelligence . Okay , what 's wrong ? Nothing . Gabriel , it 's a five-hour flight . Don 't make me guess . She 's sitting in my seat . Well , I guess you should have saved your seat with your purse . It 's a ritual , Riley - - like mojo . Like not changing your socks when you 're on a winning streak . Please tell me you 've changed your socks today . C-Doc has something for us . Go ahead . We 've gone over the WITSEC system log files , and we 've been able to confirm the hack originated domestically . We 've also run several computer models on the neurotoxin itself , making certain assumptions based on prevailing wind speed , humidity , smog - - as many factors as the model allows . Including the amount of toxin we believe can be synthesized . We 're thinking 12 to 15 kilograms . And ? It 's not good news . What you 're looking at are best - and worst-case analyses . Casualties ? Total population base - - just under a million . There is something weird , though . Weird ? Based on the chemical agent , we don 't think exposure to the toxin will result in death . - What , then ? - Muscle necrosis , paralysis , total loss of movement . It would leave its victims all brain , and no body . What if the attack was to happen downtown ? Downtown would be worst-case scenario . Lillian ? I heard you . I know you 're worried about Rebecca , but she 's gonna be fine . You can do a lot of things with your chip , Gabriel , but even you can 't predict the future . Have you called her ? Protocol exists for a reason . So do seat belts . Don 't always work , though . The best way for me to protect my daughter is to make sure that this attack never happens . Because the minute that any of us put our own interests ahead of our job , that 's the minute that my daughter 's life really is in jeopardy . Oh , and you can have your seat back now . I 've done what you asked ! It 's finished . You have the product . Do you hear ? I 'm done ! I 'm finished with this ! You still have a delivery to make . Welcome to C-Doc mobile command . Home away from home . Jameson . Nothing on the rider yet , but we 've got something on the mules . All right , hang on . Sergeant , can you put C-Doc up on the monitor ? Okay . Go ahead . Cooking a neurotoxin would require an extremely high heat , demanding a very specific vertical-flow-hood exhaust system for the waste . Right , heat and ventilation - - they were the keys . We 're talking about a relatively large load of electricity , electricity that would have to run through its own transformers . Same with the ventilation system . You can 't vent that kind of waste product through a chimney . So we began to look at commercial properties , businesses where this kind of production could be disguised . Dry cleaners , industrial bakeries , old fuel refineries . Now , we looked at satellite imagery and pulled up 14 targets fitting our profile . All of them are isolated . Very specific heat signatures , and - - boom - - spiked power draws . - Nice . - Okay . Funnel your intel here so we can set up the searches . In the meantime , I 've got a briefing with local police and disaster crews . If they find the lab , I want you two overseeing the search . Copy that . You 're worried about her . She 's not herself . That woman not only worked her way out from underneath her father 's shadow . But by the time she was my age , she was already the head of army intelligence , not to mention she practically invented Cybercom . Snooping around personnel files ? I don 't have to . Every woman in the intelligence community wants to be Lillian . Yeah , well , I 've never seen her let it get personal . Are you saying you 've never seen her act like you ? Seriously ? I told you - - I don 't want any more magazines . Mom ? Hi . Oh , my God . Hi . What 's this about magazines ? Ah , it 's nothing . It 's just the salesman keeps coming by . Well , it 's probably not a good idea to open your door to strangers . Maybe Rick could deal with the salesman . Rick 's not here . Did he find a job ? He found another girlfriend . I 'm fine . It 's been months already . This is very nice . What is it ? It 's an angel weeping over the death of a child . I 'm kidding , mom . Oh . I just started it . I don 't know what it is . Oh . So ... what brings you to San Francisco ? Business . Saving the world ? How 's your father ? You could call him and ask him . Look at your hair . It 's gotten so long . Oh , it 's horrible . No , it 's beautiful . You 're beautiful . What 's going on ? Nothing . Mom . So are you gonna be home all day ? Why ? Um , that 's why . Just ... kind of in the middle of - - The middle of something . Mm-hmm . Yes . Nelson was right . We found the lab . What about the toxin ? Negative . We 're in an old commercial paint shop , so it 's hard to get a solid result , but there was definitely a cook here . The product 's gone , though . Get all residue specimens to Cassidy as soon as possible . I want to know the concentration levels we 're dealing with . Rebecca , I need to leave for a while . Um ... could we talk later ? Mom , I have four paintings to finish , so , you know , I wish that I 'd known you were coming by earlier . But I didn 't , so ... Please , honey . I 'd really like to talk to you . Okay , mom . Fine . Call me later . Okay . Bye . Bye . You said this place went belly up a year ago ? As far as I know . Then why is there a working security camera ? Someone was watching them ? Is watching . Feed 's live . My earbud - - someone 's calling . It 's coming from a VoIP number - - voice over Internet protocol . It 's on the same line as that camera . So answer it . That 's some equipment you have . Pulled my number out of the air - - impressive . I tried facial recognition on you , and you don 't seem to exist . So you thought you 'd call me ? You know what they say about curiosity . Oh , the only cat that gets killed is the one who is found . Guess I 'm in trouble . You found me . Not quite yet . Your friend there , Riley Neal - - she seems to exist . Secret service agent , although until only recently , at which point she , too , vanishes . Who are you ? You first . Gabriel ? I can see what he sees , the other monitor feeds , but the trace is bouncing . I can 't locate him . That 's not your only camera , is it ? You 're not just watching us . You 're watching everything . You walk like an athlete . Swimmer ? Then the military got ahold you ? You trying to work a profile on me ? Just making small talk . Your breathing 's labored . Are you injured ? Your trace didn 't even come close . We 'll speak again soon . Taco scramble ! So dark in here . Let 's let a little of the day in . Taco scramble , huh ? Mm-hmm . It 's like a taco , but with eggs . How 's the stock market ? Sluggish . Hmm . I think I can do it . Okay . Okay . Here we go . Got it ? Ah . Yep . Mmm . It 's good . Oh . I 'm so glad . Mm-hmm . If you 're sure you 're okay , I 'll go get groceries . Oh , absolutely . Mwah ! Mwah ! Okay . Bye , honey . Bye-bye . Gabriel spoke to him ? Our rider managed to pull down his cell number . Your phones are encrypted . He broke into WITSEC , Adam , he 's very good . If he weren 't a murderer , I 'd hire him . Hmm . Any chance to repeat this call , trace it ? He 'll call back . The ones who make contact can 't wait to talk again . I want you back at angel 's bluff . Why ? You 're the head of the agency . In the event that Gabriel can 't stop this , I don 't want you in theater . I appreciate your concern , but I 'm staying with my people . Lillian , I know your daughter lives there . I 'm speaking to you as a friend . A friend wouldn 't question my objectivity . Lab results at the paint shop confirm the nerve toxin in powder form . That 's airborne deployment . The FAA should ground air traffic . I 'll make it happen . Thank you . Take care of yourself . Good . You 're here . Nelson and Jameson have been investigating the web streams you described seeing in our rider 's room , but they haven 't identified any potential targets . It wasn 't like that . It was more like a collection of windows to the world . There was something else that was odd . He wasn 't nervous talking to me . He was more ... curious . If he 's ill , as Gabriel says , it may be keeping him indoors . I 'm gonna take a look at the intel . So , how did your visit with Rebecca go ? I didn 't break protocol , if that 's what you 're asking . I know you didn 't . You 're too stubborn for that . For a man with a supercomputer in his head , you can be really stupid sometimes . Do you really think I don 't want to tell her ? You think it 's not haunting me right now ? But then I think - - how can I use my position to reveal that kind of information , when there are so many other mothers with daughters who can 't ? Because none of them are your daughter . Telling her doesn 't make you weak , Lillian . It makes you human . So , the question is , where the hell is the toxin ? It could be anywhere . It 's impossible to find it now . What are you thinking ? There 's a step missing . Yeah , the part where thousands of people writhe on the ground . My God ! My God ! How can you joke ? Huh ? ! Gabriel , Lillian , Riley - - all out there . I know they are , dad . You know I joke when I get nervous . We are dealing with someone who is not only capable of conceiving of such horror , but who has the skills and the access to execute it . Okay . You said we were missing a step ? Yes . An improvised weapons system has three necessary elements - - materials ... check . ... manufacture ... check . ... deployment . Each step so far has been totally compartmentalized . He used one guy to purchase the chemicals , another to cook , and the only common thread - - the hacker himself . Well , what does the hacker do now ? He hacks . He 's gonna hitch up a third mule to deploy the toxin . Mm-hmm . Hannah , breakfast . Just one more minute . Daddy , watch me . I 'm dancing . I will , baby . I just got to pay a couple of bills first . All right , guys , we 're sending an address to your GPS right now . It 's for a WITSEC detainee named Eric Hanson . He must be the next mule . I ordered the U.S. marshals to detain all the active WITSEC protectees in San Francisco . They picked up all but three . One has advanced leukemia and is in the ICU . One is in jail for beating his wife - - lovely . And the third is this Eric Hanson . He was the front man in a Ponzi scheme . Why haven 't the marshals picked him up ? Let me guess . 'Cause he 's already gone . There was no phone call . No one came to the house . Wife says one minute he was paying bills . The next , he just took off . Didn 't say where he was going or why . The thing I 'm wondering is , each of these mules has had a special skill . What 's Hanson 's ? I don 't know yet . The video game is on . It has a camera . It might have recorded what happened . I 'm in . Their daughter was dancing . I 'm chipping his laptop . Alamo Park . Anton ? Who told you this name ? I don 't know who he is , but I 'm thinking it 's the same guy who told you to be here . You understand what this is ? You understand what to do ? I know you have a gun under the table . So do I. Welcome back . Now , your phone is going to ring any second . Give it to me . I want to talk to him . What ? ! Change of plan . You might get to live after all , Anton . There 's a man and a woman about to head in your direction , coming from the south . Do exactly as I say , and you stand a fighting chance of getting your life back . Gabriel , look . The camera . Kill or be killed , Anton . Don 't let them pass ! Run ! That way ! What are you talking about ? ! Just do it ! I 'll hold them off ! Hold who off ? ! Idiot ! Run ! Oh ! Hey ! Cameras all over the park . I 'm in . I 've got Anton . He has a gun . Where 's Hanson ? I don 't see him yet . Damn it ! The cameras just went down ! He knows we 're here . Get down ! Get the people . I got him . Go ! Move ! Move ! Get down ! Drop it ! Federal agent ! Stop ! Where is he ? ! Where 's Hanson ? ! Is that you ? You are resourceful . I 'll give you that . Who made you like this ? I don 't know what you mean . You 're smart . You have skills . You got a lot going for you . Why do you want to hurt people ? Is that what you think ? I have a lot going for me ? Except for feeling sorry for yourself . Is this the part where you attempt to antagonize me , irritate me to the point where I reveal myself to you ? I don 't need you to reveal yourself . You 're all the same to me . You 're broken , and you think what you 're doing 's gonna fix it . I 'm not broken , and I 'm not interested in fixing anything . You 're lying . Oh , am I ? You have a tell . You take a sip of that straw every time you lie to me . Well , whatever you think you 're doing , it ain 't gonna work . It already has . You 're all the same to me . You 're broken , and you think what you 're doing 's gonna fix it . I 'm not broken , and I 'm not interested in fixing anything . Wait . There it is , right after the , uh , foghorn - - the straw . Yep . Gabriel , you 're right . That sucking sound is odd , though - - deliberate . It 's like a siphon . It 's a non-return bite valve . God ! Found on hands-free drinking systems used by quadriplegics . Ooh . Our rider is paralyzed . Which might explain the choice of toxin - - paralysis , not death . He wants everyone to be like him . That narrows the profile . Well , Lillian , there are still millions of people in the U.S. incapacitated in this way . He could be anywhere . Come on , people ! Think ! We 've got a mule out there with a tank full of a neurotoxin ! Just find him ! All right , look . We know that the guy 's got mad tech skills , right ? And in the first call , he thought Gabriel was an athlete . It often takes one to know one . Okay , so he was an athlete before he was incapacitated , and he 's a technology expert . That 's good . So what else do we know ? It 's not just the technology . It 's how he uses it . It 's like an extension of himself . Something you know a little bit about . He manipulates people to do things they wouldn 't do unless he was pressing their buttons . He 's programming them , something you might know a little bit about . - Touché . - Add to that his environment . He 's surrounded by computers that connect him to the outside world . But they don 't connect him . They isolate him . What was it you said to me , doc ? The chip will exceed my human abilities , but ... We can 't ever let it exceed your humanity . He didn 't have anyone around to remind him of that . All right , what else we got ? Hi . You 've reached Rebecca . Please leave a message . Lillian ? My daughter . We haven 't always gotten along . It 's not easy . And you 're worried about her . Maybe you should forget protocol , just be her mom . I can 't leave . Lillian ... I was 15 when I shot my mother 's boyfriend . She and I both know that if I hadn 't , he would have killed her . And we still didn 't speak for 14 years . Whatever there is between you two , I know you can fix it . Believe me . But not if you don 't trust her . Not if you don 't ... at least give her a chance to really know you . Lillian , we will find this guy . Thank you , Riley . Foghorn . The foghorn ! What about it ? Nelson , bring up the recording of the call right at the sound of the foghorn . Yeah , you got it . I 'm not broken , and I 'm not interested in fixing anything . That foghorn is famous . It 's on the tower of the Golden Gate Bridge . Wait . You know this . What neighborhoods are near there ? Uh , Cow Hollow , the Presidio , and the Marina . If he 's paralyzed , he 'd have built ramps or maybe an elevator . And if it 's a house , there 'd be building permits . I 'm in the building inspector 's system right now . There were 623 permit requests for handicap upgrades in the past 10 years . All include photos of the work being done . For the kind of processing he 's doing , this guy would need a high-speed ISDN line - - at least a T3 . Okay . That 's rare for residential use . That narrows it to one . Jonathan Cain . Gabriel , can you access a T3 line ? I 'm in his webcam now . What do you see ? Our rider . Let 's go . I 've got a two-man team positioned out back , in case he runs . He 's not running . Can I help you ? Is Jonathan Cain here ? Jonathan ? Why ? What on earth is going on ? We 're federal agents . Is he here ? Of course he 's here . He hasn 't left the house in years . Excuse me , ma 'am . Federal agents . Where 's the toxin ? You 're too late . Hi . Name , please ? Eric Hanson . Welcome to the annual shareholders meeting , Mr. Hanson . We 'll be starting in just a few minutes . If you like , you can head right on in . Where 's Hansen ? Where 's the toxin gonna be released ? Where it will do the most good . Good ? People 's lives are gonna be destroyed . Jonathan ? What 's happening ? What 's going on ? Your husband is about to release a deadly neurotoxin somewhere in San Francisco . - What ? - The agent isn 't deadly . That 's the whole point . For God 's sake , what have you done ? The race was the first time you realized something was wrong , wasn 't it ? That 's what this is all about . I was working in the chem lab at the college . There was an accident . They said it was Meniere 's ataxia , but I shouldn 't despair , that a cure wasn 't that far off . Now ... I can 't even hold my own wife . Jonathan . Jonathan , listen to me . Nothing matters , except that I love you . You don 't understand . You feel isolated , alone . The more you try to connect with the world through all these wires , the more isolated you become . And the more dependent you become on the technology , the more you feel you 're losing yourself . You try to convince yourself you 're not a machine , but that 's the way everyone else looks at you . But you called me . You were trying to connect . You can still stop this , Jonathan . Is that your best carnival act ? You look at a photo on the wall , and think you know how to get to me ? I think you look at the photo on the wall , and you want that man back so badly you 're willing to rage against the world in ways that man never imagined . Get him out of here . Hi , mom . Rebecca , I need you to leave town and go spend the weekend up in Marin with your father . What are you talking about ? Just get your things together and go , please . I 'm not going anywhere . What 's this about ? For God 's sake , use your brain . Why am I hear , Rebecca ? Because you 're a control freak , you have no respect for me , and you somehow think that everyone , including your own family , works for you . This isn 't going the way I wanted it to go . Well , how did you think it would go when you just barge in here and start shouting orders ? That 's a very good point . It is ? Yes , it is . Rebecca , I need you to not ask me any questions and just go to your father 's house . I 'll call later and explain . Please , honey . Just do this for me this once . Okay , mom . I 'll leave right now . Thank you . Look , guys , Cain needs to deploy the toxin soon before it becomes useless . What good can come from paralyzing other people ? How does that help him recover ? - ' Cause it makes them just like him . - Yes . That 's - - that is the sad truth of medical discovery - - the more people suffering from a disease or a condition , the more incentive there is to develop a cure - - the incentive being money . Nelson , is anyone developing a treatment for Meniere 's ataxia ? No one . What about Jennings Pharmaceutical ? Yeah , they were in it , but RD got too expensive , so they pulled out of a five-year trial nine months ago . Yes , this would have been Cain 's last chance . Hanson 's a shareholder . Jennings is having their annual shareholders meeting today in San Francisco . The entire board will be there . And the price-to-earnings ratio is up a sharp 11 % from this time last year , largely due to inroads into a new tech , vascular diagnostics , and treatment market . Now , we cap out here at 33 % . Listen up ! Everybody needs to evacuate this theater . Excuse me . What 's going on ? Leave your personal belongings where they are and follow the officers outside . Do it now ! Got him . Stop ! My family . I 'm sorry . I - - Where is it ? ! He was gonna kill my wife and my little girl ! We have him ! He can 't hurt them ! Now , where the hell is it ? ! Oh , my God . I-it 's under my seat ! It 's in the case ! And it 's on a timer ! How much time is left ? I don 't know - - a couple minutes . I got it . How much time ? A minute 33 , 32 ... Cassidy , you copy ? We 're with you . There 's not enough time for a full evacuation . If this nerve toxin is released , it could seep into the building 's vents . It could contaminate the entire area surrounding the building . ... 21 , 20 . CO2 ! You need CO2 , Gabriel ! Is there a fire extinguisher nearby ? Yeah . CO2 will what , neutralize it ? No , CO2 will freeze the timer 's oscillator . It 'll buy you some time . For how long ? Unknown . Unknown ? ! Great . Hit it . I can 't see the timer . Yeah , it doesn 't matter , Gabriel ! Now you need an intense heat . Intense heat ? ! Now you want me to blow up a chemical weapon inside a crowded building ? Yeah , preferably in the next 20 seconds or so . The building furnace . This way . Adding heat to the pressurized cannisters will result in an explosion . Yes , but that should - - should catalyze a reaction between the powder and the nitrogen in the air and render the toxin inert . " Should " ? You don 't sound too confident , doc . Dad ? Crapshoot . That 's great . Are you ready ? Do it ! Move ! Riley ? Where 's Gabriel ? He 's fine . How did things go with your daughter ? I 'm glad I went . Me too . I thought it would , uh , get easier as she grew older . But even when I know I 'm doing the right thing , it just never feels right . Can I speak freely ? Were you not speaking freely before ? There are so many things about my mom I wish she 'd had the courage to tell me . Lillian , if Rebecca knew you - - I mean really knew you - - she 'd be so proud . You know , I would have taken you to dinner . But then you would have missed my cooking . Who taught you to cook ? He always was a good cook . I mean , he even made your baby food himself . Yeah . He usually reminds me of that when he 's mad at me . So , did you finish your paintings ? Um ... all but one . Do you want to see it ? Sure , if you don 't mind . Come on . Oh , Rebecca . Do you remember ? Of course , sweetheart . Of course . I remember . I remember every second of it . Oh , honey , I-I know it 's often been hard for you . You 've always felt that you never really know your mother . Well , I think it 's time to change that .

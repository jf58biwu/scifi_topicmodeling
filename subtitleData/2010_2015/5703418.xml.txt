 [ indistinct talking ] [ blows ] How did you do that ? A magician never reveals his secrets . Then I 'll have to pierce your shell and gaze within ? You understood . Chan Ho Yin . Raina . I would love to see that fire trick again . - I don 't think that 's a good idea . - Of course not . It 's a great idea . [ keys jingling ] I am sorry for the clutter . I 'm in between places . [ door closes ] How long have you been here ? Six years . Beer ? [ bottles clinking ] You seem to have an appreciation for the greats . - I idolized him for many years . - And now ? There 's no real magic there , just tricks . And what you do ... those aren 't tricks ? Show me . I 'm sorry . [ chuckles ] I really shouldn 't . Says who ? What are you afraid of ? It 's not me who 's afraid . [ gasps ] That can 't be real . See for yourself . [ gasps ] - How long have you been able to ... - First time was a few years ago . A dish towel caught fire in my hands . I almost burned down my entire apartment . [ breathes sharply ] And it doesn 't hurt ? Not even a little . You have a gift . I 've never seen anything like it . Why not show the world ? I ask that same question every day . There are people who ... Never mind . It 's just ... for years , I did illusions , tricks , like the rest . And then this happens . It 's real ... real magic . If I believed in such things , I would say it was a miracle , that this happened for a reason . - I believe you 've been chosen . - You do ? Close your eyes and I 'll show you . That 'll do . [ action music ] [ grunting ] [ engines roaring ] Ward : Every decision you make from here on out has consequences . So be warned ... the kiddie gloves are off . Skye : G7 . - Hit . - Yes ! Ha ! So , explain to me again what this has to do with my training . It 's important for every S.O. to evaluate their student 's thought process . Mm-hmm . And I like board games . B10 . Nope . This isn 't thinking . This is stabbing in the dark , but it 's nice to take a break from the workouts . - Well ... - You deserve a break . I got to give Coulson credit . I would have never pegged an Ex-Rising Tide hacker as a good fit , but ... you 're picking things up pretty fast . Did you just give me a compliment ? - I ... no , I made a comment . - A kind one . Did it physically hurt to do that ? Do you need an ice pack ? [ both laugh ] Wow . A compliment and a smile . - Comment . - I don 't want to ruin the moment , but I 'm gonna have to respond with ... G4 . Say it , Ward . [ sighs ] - Say it . - You sank my battleship . [ laughs ] - Yes ! - All right , best 2 out of 3 . - I beat you . - Best 2 out of 3 . Best I just won out of nothing . - She 's fitting in nicely . - May : Gloating ? - A little . - You were up early this morning . Heard you puttering around even before I started Tai Chi . - Having trouble sleeping ? - No , I feel great . Just have a little extra energy to burn . If you want , I could lay out the mats downstairs . We could go a few rounds , like the old days ? [ chuckles ] [ alarm blaring ] Saved by the bell . Chan Ho Yin ... just a struggling street performer until a few years ago , when Mr. Chan began to exhibit moderate pyrokinetic abilities . - So what gave him powers ? - It 's still under investigation , but Chan did live near the decommissioned Wan Tai nuclear plant when it caught fire . To our knowledge , no other nearby residents - have exhibited similar traits . - So how did we find out about him ? Informant saw him lighting torches in a street show ... with his pinkie . Brought it to S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s attention . We told him to keep his abilities under wraps . - He 's been on the index ever since . - The index ? Simmons : It 's a list S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps of people and objects with powers . Wait . What ? How many are there ? - Are you saying there are more people ... - Not many . - Well , enough to keep a list . - A short list , meant to protect them . Though , in rare cases , S.H.I.E.L.D. has had to take action . Action against objects or people ? Well , that 's drastic with a side of creepy . How are they monitored ... Tapped phones , satellite surveillance , body probes in dark , unpleasant places ? Fitz : Body probes ? Now , that 's ridiculous . S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn 't do that . We don 't do that . Do we ? The methods vary . Mr. Chan was low-risk . He was assigned a case agent who checked in with him every few days . That 's how we discovered him missing . Everyone , this is agent Kwan , Chan Ho Yin 's case agent . What can you tell us ? Not much , I 'm afraid . Chan is a magician , so at first , I thought he 'd made himself disappeared . The file says you 'd caught him violating his index agreement before . On two separate occasions ... claimed we were " hampering his artistic expression . " But late last night , he was taken by professionals . The only thing they left behind was this scrap of aluminized material . Fireproof clothing . So whoever took him knew about his power . Yes , and we think we know why . Over the last few days , tech division discovered a crack into our data stream . It 's the same cyber punks who hacked us before . Somehow , they got in again . It 's the Rising Tide . Hello ? It got real quiet . You guys still there ? [ tapping ] The Rising Tide is a huge organization of hacktivists from all around the world . Any of them could have done this ! - It wasn 't me . - No one 's saying it was . But you 're thinking it . I can see your faces thinking it . Coulson : We 're assessing the situation . Then I 'm sure you 're taking into account that I have been living on a plane with you this whole time . It would be impossible for me to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. Or easier . We 're gonna need more than that . Fine . Let me trace the hack , and I 'll prove it . I believe her , sir . And if she 's telling the truth , we need to track down the person responsible . Dig up something , and fast . The longer Mr. Chan 's missing , the more danger he 's in . Raina : Good morning , Chan . [ grunts ] - What the hell ? - I apologize for last night . It was important I bring you in under the radar . - Oh . S.H.I.E.L.D. - Tell Agent Kwan I don 't need to be read the power protocols again . It was just a street performance ... - it 's not like I set anyone on fire . - I don 't work for S.H.I.E.L.D. - I come as a friend . - English isn 't my first language , but that word means something different than you think . I understand your frustration , but I believe you have a gift . And if you let me , I 'd like to help you nurture it . I can increase it . You 'll get people 's attention then . Increase my power ? Why ? What 's the catch ? - I 'd like to run some tests . - There it is . Now , will you let me go , or must I fight my way out ? Leave now , and I 'll forget you , I promise , but so will everyone else . Stay , and you can be remembered , known the world over . You want to make Chan Ho Yin a famous name ? No . You need a simpler name , a ... a more powerful name , a name like ... Scorch . Scorch ? Are you joking ? Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers ? No . But Captain America ... now , he 's on the news , on a lunchbox , on a poster on the wall . I don 't want to be a superhero . You want to be recognized ... for your gift . And who is more recognizable than them ? I was given this power for a reason . - I just want people to see what I can do . - They will . All I want is what you want ... for you to be remembered , to be seen for what you 're meant to be a star . Scorch . It 's growing on me . [ chuckles ] - How close are we ? - Almost there . She 's identified the remote-access trojan and the infected endpoint ... And is searching for a TCP to correlate the hypertext with signature information and then ... - Bob is your uncle . - ... voilá . - You get any of that ? - Only the uncle part . We got our origin ... Austin , Texas . You got a name ? Just the café our hacker worked out of , but I 'm in the system . I 'm gonna check to see if any credit-card charges from that day match up with any known hackers . We got a hit . Miles Lydon , not Skye ... that 's to all of our relief . - You know him ? - Every hacker in the world knows him . Not just the hacker world . He infiltrated the Kremlin . Yeah , the picture of , uh , Putin shirtless on horseback ... that was his hack . It was also his hack that got Chan kidnapped . May , set a course for Austin . - Just did . - What about Chan ? Kwan 's got a S.H.I.E.L.D. team on the ground . Our best bet is to chase this thing from the other end . Find Mr. Lydon , bring him in . See what he knows . [ engines roaring ] Just left the café where Miles logged in . Cashier says she hasn 't seen him in over a week . Ward : I may have eyes on him . I 've been made . Heading East on 5th street . Target is now in a silver Jetta . Coulson : I got him . [ tires screeching ] All right , suit . You asked for it . [ beeps ] Gridlock protocol . [ horns honking ] [ tires screech ] [ sighs ] I lost him . Woman : You sure they 're not following you ? Yeah . Had to pull out all the stops , though . Thanks for the text . Wait , are you mad ? Are you kidding me ? I don 't have much time . - Who did you leak those files to ? - Wait a second . What ? " Good to see you , too , Miles . " I released them into the world , where they belong . They 'll keep hunting you unless they have someone else to look for . And why the hell would you hack S.H.I.E.L.D. ? - Because that 's what we do . - Not when I 'm on the inside . You could have ruined everything , you dumbass . - Seems like you handled it . - I 've come too far for you to ... Why are looking at me like that ? - Did you just call me " dumbass " ? - Stop smiling . I 'm serious . Because I taught you everything you know , - so what does that make you ? - No , you didn 't . I 'm sorry . I can 't help it . I 've been missing you like crazy . [ laughs ] - That 's where you keep that , huh ? - Better safe than busted . - Making any progress on that ? - I 'm digging , but your little stunt is gonna make it harder . - [ sighs ] Where 's my top ? - You know , I could be helping you . If you send me ciphertext , I could be working on algorithms ... No , I can 't contact you . I never should have . There 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. team looking for you right now ... my team . And if they suspect something , I 'm screwed . There 's a joke here that I 'm resisting - that involves the word " screwed . " - Shut up . There 's a guy in trouble because of you , and I got to get back . So if you want to help me , help me find my clothes . Hey . I 'm sorry , Skye . Really , I am , if I messed anything up . - I 've missed you . - Me , too . But we talked about this when I left for L.A. I 've got a chance here . So S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s off-limits , okay ? Okay . At least tell me what it 's like . - Come on , the belly of the beast . - Surprisingly ... unbeastly . I 've got good people I 'm working with . Some good stories , though , I hope ? [ chuckles ] Miles . You have no idea . - But that 's classified . - Miles : You did not just say that to me ! [ laughs ] Come on , you got to tell me something . Someday . Well , if they ever let you go on leave or whatever , let me know , and I 'll get us a suite at the ... fancy hotel that has suites , and you can regale me with stories while naked . A suite ? You ? That 's funny . But they 're never gonna let me go on anything if I don 't find my stupid ... - ... top . - Get ... dressed . [ doors close ] I know how this looks ... How long have you two been in contact ? I contacted him once the day I joined to tell him I was okay and once earlier today . When you tipped off an active suspect ? No , it 's not like that . Miles and I ... we met when we were both a little screwed up . Scratch that ... he was a little screwed up , I was a lot . But we looked after one another . That 's why I warned him , not because we 're working together on this , but because we 're ... friends . - I 'm really sorry . - Noted . If not you , then who is Mr. Lydon working with ? No one . He 's an idealist , believes in freedom of information . That information cost a man his freedom , and you sabotaged our attempts to remedy that . No , I came here to find out what Miles knows about Chan . - And ? - Nothing . - Miles is a dead end . He 's harmless . - We 'll see . Really , I was gonna find out everything I could to try to help . I just ... I felt like I couldn 't tell you guys everything . I know . That 's why I asked May to follow you . Seems that wasn 't a dead end . Why would Skye do this to us for him ? I thought she was our friend . I think she is , Fitz . He 's just obviously more than that . Yeah , but we 've been through so much together , and she didn 't even tell us that she has a guy . Well , who knows what they 've been through together ? May : The classified information you stole from us ... who did you give it to ? It 's information . It has a life of its own . What happened to Mr. Chan ? I don 't know who that is , so why don 't you tell me ? [ glass shatters , clattering ] So , are you guys just gonna destroy all my stuff ? Yes . - Anything ? - I don 't have to talk to you . Take him in . Gather all the evidence and secure the prisoners . We got what we were looking for here . We 're going to Hong Kong . I 'm so sorry , Ward . - This is not what it looks like . - Hands . Now get up . [ sighs ] Uh , you missed a button . [ sighs ] What is this big place , Raina ? And who are these guys ? They 'll assist you with anything you need . We 're here to monitor your vitals while we observe your powers . And it 's big because we 'll need the space . This serum strengthens the cytoskeleton within each cell of your body . One dose , and you 'll feel incredible ... until it wears off . - And it will wear off ? - Yes . But the effects in average subjects have been impressive . In you , I 'm excited to see . What do you think of the name " scorch " ? [ gasps ] Breathe . [ breathes deeply ] Feel it ? Now let 's see what you can do . Whoa . [ chuckling ] Oh , sorry ! You almost got scorched . This is incredible . Whoo ! You are a beautiful angel ... you know that ? Your power is an amazing gift . And S.H.I.E.L.D. wouldn 't let me use it . But thanks to you , the whole world can finally see what I can do . From now on , nobody holds me back . [ breathing deeply ] [ grunts ] [ engines roaring ] So , I guess due process isn 't really S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . They don 't have time for it . Whoa , are you defending them ? These people are denying our basic rights . This isn 't about us . They 're trying to save someone 's life . Listen to yourself . That 's what they always say to justify invading privacy , Skye . These people stand for everything we despise ... - secrets , censorship ... - Enough with the manifesto , Miles . We can 't let them get away with it ! Manning , Snowden , Aaron Swartz ... - these are modern-day revolutionaries . - This has nothing to do with that . You leaked ... [ computer beeps ] Guy 's hiding behind platitudes . He 's dirty . I can feel it . Scrubbed clean , actually ... nothing much on him . He 's got no family records . His apartment 's under an alias . And he plays a lot of " Minecraft , " where he runs a rather nasty mob . - Is it ... is it zombie ? - Zombie pigmen . Keep looking . - Go ahead . Say it . - I don 't do petty . But you called it . I trusted my gut , even though you said she was a risk . When someone breaks into my house , I usually don 't invite them to stay , but that 's me . That was me , too . Then that alien staff went through my heart . Sure it didn 't go through the brain ? You really don 't do comforting , either , do you ? What is your gut telling you now ? - That she 's still hiding something . - Sir , we found some evidence . She 's been defending you , saying you 're a stand-up guy . So I 'm going to give you a chance . Do you want to tell her , or should I ? - I don 't have to listen to you ... - There goes your chance . Your boyfriend here made a few deposits in the days following the leak . All said ... it 's about a million dollars . What ? - Real stand-up guy. - I can explain ... Did you sell information ? Miles ? - Yes or no ? Did you ? ! - Yes , but ... Ohh ! You are so dead . What the hell were you thinking ? ! It was a million dollars . A million dollars . It would change my life ... our lives . And that woman was harmless . I looked into it . No one with good intentions pays that kind of money for information ! - Did you ever think about that ? ! - Of course I did . I would never have done it if I thought ... - Who is the woman you referred to ? - A fan of the Rising Tide , some rich girl in a flower dress . She knew all about me , said I had a gift . She thought people like us deserved more . Oh , you deserve more . She pointed me to a Chinese S.H.I.E.L.D. feed ... - wanted me to crack it . - You thought that was harmless ? I checked the data stream . It didn 't seem like anything you and I hadn 't already put out there , Skye . And I traced the account where the money came from to make sure it wasn 't some evil corporation . It was just an eco-research lab . - Otherwise , I would never ... - Ecological research ? Yeah , insects , some study with centipedes . What 's more harmless than that ? [ beeping ] It appears the volatility in the serum has been neutralized . I 'm surprised you got him to cooperate . He has dreams . I told him they 'd come true . [ sighs ] You gave him a name , didn 't you ? Everyone wants to be remembered . Mm . Well , thank god no one 's gonna have to actually call him that . You were right . The platelets in his blood prevent the extremis in the serum from combusting . That 's fantastic . The others will be pleased . Good work , Raina . Now drain him . [ door closes ] [ sighs ] It appears Centipede is responsible for Mr. Chan 's kidnapping . First L.A. , now Hong Kong . What kind of organization are we dealing with ? International , well-financed , interested in creating a super soldier . Let 's hope finding Mr. Chan will provide some answers . Using the account information Mr. Lydon gave us , S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ believes he 's being held here . Any ideas what Centipede wants with Chan ? Hard to say , but Simmons thinks that considering he 's pyrokinetic ... There 's a good chance his genetics could stabilize the extremis element of the Centipede serum . - Keep their test subjects from going ... - Boom ! If Mr. Chan is Centipede 's lab rat , we need to get there before the experiment 's over . This is no test . This is torture . [ whirring ] Thank you for your participation . Our group really owes you one . I won 't let you . [ grunts ] [ screaming ] [ gasping ] What have you done ? We don 't understand what gave you this ability , but the reason you don 't burn is because your blood platelets are fire-resistant . Which is why we 're removing them . Take this upstairs . - Raina , you said I have a gift . - And you 're giving it . Raina ! Raina ! [ gun cocks ] Agent May and I will be handling the field work . You stay and oversee the prisoners . Sir ? I was Skye 's S.O. It was my responsibility ... It was my call to bring Skye onto the plane , and you warned me against it . My problem ... I fix it . I 'm sorry . I honestly didn 't know . All our talks ... did you mean none of it ? I risked everything to help you , and it turns out every word out of your mouth since we met is total crap ! - That 's not true . - Democratization of knowledge ... " the truth will set you free . " The truth sure as hell came out . I believe in all those things . I just don 't know why they have to go hand in hand with barely scraping by . Come on , Skye . You lived in your van for the last two years . Now you 're making fun of my van ? I could have funded us for years ... us . So you wouldn 't have to sacrifice your principles , joining this corrupt institution to find what you 're looking for . And what 's wrong with me trying to do that ? I 'll tell you what 's wrong with that ... an innocent guy might die ... for money . You know I 'd never intentionally hurt anyone . I 'm just trying to get my life together . At least you know what you 're looking for . Me ... I don 't have that . For a long time , I thought it was you . - I guess I was wrong . - I guess so . Building has five floors . The first four are research . Fifth is listed as maintenance but uses half the building 's energy . Either they 're guarding the world 's largest vacuum ... Or that 's where Chan 's being held . Send your " B " and " C " teams in through the tunnels to secure the lower floors . Warn them that the Centipede serum 's highly explosive . Understood . Where do we go in ? [ whirring ] The roof . There . Heat signature confirmed . I love these things . [ beeps ] [ grunting ] Agent Kwan ... it 's you . We 're here to get you out . [ monitor beeping ] [ alarm blaring ] Strike team needs a security override , stat . Kwan , can you arrange ... - Chan , what have you done ? - I 've set myself free . Coulson 's in trouble . Aaaah ! Mr. Chan , I know you 're in pain . This is nothing . You were the ones killing me , forcing me to keep this gift locked up inside . So we 're good , right ? The entire facility 's been locked down . - Are you sure about this ? - No . This is pretty cool . Skye : The alarms disconnected the system from all exterior servers . - Can you fix it or not ? - Yes , but you 've got to get me on-site . - No way . - Not a chance . You 're a hacker , Skye , not Seal team 6 . No . But he is . Aaah ! His file say anything about him being homicidal ? Just said he was kind of a tool . Mr. Chan , believe it or not , this can still get worse . You bend someone long enough , and they break . Poor little Chan Ho Yin may have believed your lies , - but not Scorch . - Who ? Oh , crap . They gave him a name . Get me a clean look . I 'll make sure he wakes up in a S.H.I.E.L.D. containment facility . Waking is optional at this point . [ shouts in Cantonese ] I 'm out . Nothing can stop me ! Where are we on the doors ? Almost there . Ohh ! S.H.I.E.L.D. has infiltrated the building . - No , it 's under control . - Didn 't want to tell them ? Chan 's true nature has revealed itself . Without his platelets , the serum will combust . Wouldn 't be the first one to blow up on you . I 'm beginning to think you 're bad luck . - How long is this gonna take ? - Done . Coulson : Doors are unlocked . Where 's Chan ? - He 's gone . - Damn it . That tranquilizer was his last chance . You know that . I know . It 's time to minimize the damage . Simmons ... are the building 's computers back online ? [ computer beeps ] - Yes . - Uncuff Miles . We 're gonna need his help . You ! [ elevator bell dings ] I wish you all the best . [ panting ] Please , look , we can fix you ... make you stronger , take the name Scorch and make it mean something . It already does . Aah ! [ screaming ] Mr. Chan , we don 't want to hurt you but we have to . We gotta move ! [ computer beeping ] You need to drive the blast into the main ventilation shaft . Yeah , and on up to the roof . [ beeping continues ] [ explosion ] Skye managed to extract some files from the building 's mainframe . It 's not much , but could get us a fix on Centipede . Maybe . You can 't save someone from themselves , sir . You can if you get to them early enough . You 've got two choices ... take what 's in this box , or we put you in a slightly bigger one . You want to give me a hint ? - What 's it do ? - Whatever we tell it to do . I 'd try to avoid any unlawful activity , and I think you 'll find it hard to use electronic devices for a while . [ box closes ] - You can go now . - Cool , but we 're still in Hong Kong . - Yep . - I live in Austin , Texas . I know . Oh , and Agent Kwan 's family thanks you for the anonymous donation . My office . So , you plan to stay ? If they let me . - You 've changed . - Good . I mean , you 're not who you used to be . And you 're not who I thought you were . I hope you find what you 're looking for . [ footsteps ] - Make it a double . - Is there any other kind ? So , I 'm going to Coulson 's office now . I figured you might want to be there , being my S.O. and all . I 'm off the clock . Right . Okay , then . [ door opens ] - I didn 't want anything to ... - Coulson : Stop lying . Since the moment you stepped foot on this plane , you 've been lying to my face , to all of us . - I haven 't ... - You 're lying now ! I stood up for you to my team down there . And some of us started to believe in you , risked our lives for you . - I ... - Why are you here ? ! You 've been keeping something from us ... this whole time . And it wasn 't just a boyfriend . You have a secret , Skye , and one chance to come out with it . That 's now , or I 'm done with you . - What is this ? - It 's everything I have . - On us ? - On me . [ voice breaking ] That 's why I learned to crack systems , why I joined the Rising Tide ... to find any details I could about my parents . There 's nothing . No records . There 's no trace of them . My lifelong search has led to a single document ... - redacted . - By S.H.I.E.L.D. No matter what you do , I 'll never stop looking . You might not like what you find . It can 't be worse than what I 've imagined . Maybe I can help . [ bracelet beeps , clicks ] Coulson : Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will return in a moment ... Well , you know I 'm not going to do the talking . - The doctor is dead . - About time . Well , she did find a solution to our ... combustion problem . We believe we 'll soon have stable subjects . On to stage two . That mean my situation 's going to improve any ? Well , other problems have surfaced ... resurfaced , I should say . The S.H.I.E.L.D. unit in Hong Kong ... we 've encountered them before . They ... took our subject off the map in Los Angeles . Not much I can do about that in here . So that 's not why I 'm getting the visit . We would like you to touch base with the Clairvoyant . See if any insights can be given ... on stage three . The Clairvoyant doesn 't like to be touched . We all have to do things that make us uncomfortable if we are ever to get our toy soldiers off the shelf . You know that better than any of us . I like your dress . I know .

 Dear dad , { * in your last letter } you questioned whether it 's my responsibility to join this fight . The truth is we all became responsible the day we created the cylons . We 're the one who let these robots become our servants , our trusted helpers , and even our friends . We let them into our lives only to see them repay our trust with a violent revolt against us . I know there is a lot of debate about why they hate us . But in the end , Does it really matter ? Kill the enemy or be killed . That 's the reality . In a war where mankind very survival hangs in the balance , it 's up to each of us to make a difference . Being a pilot is the best way I know how to do that . Your loving son , William Adama . Hold still , you Toaster bastard . Watch out , Hot shot . You 've got a bandit on your six . That 's fine , just add to the challenge . Come on , Kid . Break off ! Break off ! No way , I got this . Come on , come on , come on . Frak , I can 't ... I can 't see ! You 've got no visibility , Kid . Get out of there . Watch you back , Kid . It 's coming around again . There we go . Much better . What are you crazy ? Return to base ! You can 't take that kind of radiation exposure You 'd die in less than 30 sec . 20 sec and counting ! You 're approaching radiation exposure max . Frak , my gun is jammed ! - You only have 12 sec left ! - Frak that ! Okay . Game over . Are you crazy , you can 't fire ... Deal with it , suckers ! - Come on , tell me that ain 't no record . - Congratulation captain , You have completed level six . Good sim score ? Oh , no . Not a good sim score . The top sim score . - I 'm impressed . - Thanks . I 'd be if I were you . Lookout Jay , we 've got a live one . Let me guess . { * You are fresh out of the academy and } You 've been itching to fly a Viper since you were in short pants { * But } You { * r only } worry { * now is } that the war will be over before you { * get a chance to } can prove what { * a bona fide } ace you are . Congratulations , you got me pegged . Except for the worrying part . I don 't do that . Look at the pair on you . Was that a request ? No don 't get your hopes up , rook . You 're not my type . Good so it 's a date . Town boy ! - You are a real charger , ain 't you ? - Thank you . If you 're looking for some action , there 's a girl who 's gonna give it to you . Gods damn ... - Yo rook , you 're blocking traffic . - I 'm sorry . That 's Deke Tornvald . The " Minute Man . " - You heard of him , huh ? - Heard of him ? He was { * like } my hero at the Academy . { * What 's } He got { * now , like } 30 kills ? You 'd better hurry or there won 't be any left for you , ace . Look out ! Back just in time . Suit up ! Briefing in 30 . Another snowball patrol ? What 's this , fresh meat ? Ensign William Adama , reporting for flight duty , sir . If there 's a mission , I 'd like to be part of it . Papers . At ease . You 're F.O.B. , Ensign . Sure you don 't want to find your rack first ? Respectfully , sir , I signed on to kill Toasters , not take naps . Just point me at my plane and I 'll get started . All right , Ensign , I 'm assigning you to the Weasel . She 's over there . - She 's beautiful , sir . - Not the Viper . The bird behind her . That old flying pillbox , sir ? It 's a Raptor . That 's a designation you 're qualified . Sir , there has to be some kind of mistake . Respectfully , sir , I didn 't rate top of my class so I could drive a bus . - I 'm a Viper pilot . - Congratulations ! I 'll break it down for you like this . { * The brass makes it seems like Operation Clean Sweep really lived up to its name , } They 're acting like Operation Clean Sweep was a success , but somebody forgot to give the Toasters that memo . They 're taking down our planes right and left . Right now , I need Raptor drivers more than I need Viper jocks . So make sure your " bus " is ready for action . - Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . Good . Dismissed . I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . I just finished mucking this all thing out . Sorry , I didn 't see what was going on . Of course you didn 't , because you weren 't looking ! What are you doing in here ? Are you with that goddamn press tour ? No ... I 'm William Adama . I was just assigned to fly this bird . - So I came to get acquainted . - You ? - You 're my new driver ? - Yeah ? They send me a rook fresh of the boat ? - Guess you must be my new Copilot . - Not if I can do anything about it . I want new gyros on there this time . - Or I 'll be pissed off ! - I 'm working on it , Lt. Let me help you with all this . Just leave it ! I said leave it alone . Fasio ... Fasiovik . Frak . { * If you gotta call me something , just } Call me Coker . Just don 't get too familiar with it . Okay . So ... Coker , who was your last pilot ? I 'm just mopping of what 's left of him . Frakking knuckle draggers . Poor bastard . Who the frak signs up for a third tour ? Look , I 'm sorry about your friend . He wasn 't my frakking friend ! He was an ass . And he was worth ten huskers like you ! Lieutenant Fasjovik and Captain Adama , please report to the CO . Briefing call . Here we go again . Just listen real good and try not to get us killed , okay , rook ? And you better clean up ! And stick with your barn yard tractor pulls . I 'm from Caprica city . Yeah tell that to someone who cares , husker . You 're gonna offer the commander a drink ? What ? Flask . Frak . Let 's go ! - Sir . - Mister Fasjovik . Forty-seven days left in your mandatory second tour . Planning on re-upping ? Not if I get a say in it , sir . Hard to part with an experienced officer , but that 's your call . - Clean up that image . - Yes , sir . Ensign William Adama . Caprican with some interesting Tauron family connections . The Ha 'la 'tha ? Can 't see that my family has anything to do with this mission , sir . Relax , son . I 'd never judge a man on his father 's sins or merits . Your grades at the Academy weren 't exactly stellar but your flight instructor says you 're a " natural . " I quote : " One of the best pilot candidates I 've ever seen . " And unfortunately he knows it . You 're a cocky son of a bitch , aren 't you , Ensign ? Yes , you are . So is this an accurate assessment , son ? Are you a natural ? I can fly a plane , sir . A " natural , " I can 't say . Is that mine , Mister Singh ? Thank you . We 're ten years into a bad war , son , so now this is how I handle cocky sons of bitches on my ship . I assign ' em to milk runs until they cool down . Your orders . - Something funny , Mister Fasjovik ? - Not at all , sir . You boys are gonna take some cargo to the Scorpion shipyards and return with spare parts . It 's a four-day round trip . I 'd assign a jump-capable ship if I could afford one , but I can 't , so your sorry-ass Raptor will have to do . Above all , you 're to avoid any enemy contact . That includes Cylon ships , SAMS , slingshots , or anything else they might happen to have floating around out there . - Understood ? - Yes , sir . Gentlemen , do not frak this up .

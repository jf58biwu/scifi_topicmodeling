[ Tones playing ] I don 't know if you 've heard the news , but it 's good , everyone . I fixed my hearing aid . [ Squealing ] [ Tones playing ] Say , what 's that sound ? It 's that shwacked-out music from outer space again . Darned kids . In my day , sound didn 't travel through space . There 's something really familiar about that melody . [ Tones playing ] It 's not " Walking on Sunshine " . It 's not " Foggy Mountain Breakdown " . What else is there ? I don 't know , but I do have a friend who helps me identify melodies . His name is shazam . [ Beeping ] Shazam , what song is this ? [ Clears throat ] [ Singing tone ] Shazam : Your singing is awful . I can 't take it anymore . [ Tones playing ] There it is again . It 's driving me crazy . Why am I the only one whining ? All personnel , report to the laboratory . I 've discovered the source of the music . [ Laughing ] Hologram off . As you can see , I 've picked up an alien ship on the long-range scanner . It seems to be emitting musical tones in an effort to communicate . Why don 't they just use a thoughtspike like normal people ? [ With echo ] : I don 't know , Amy . But what are those aliens trying to ask us ? What do the tones mean ? Isn 't it obvious ? Uh , no . Drat , I was hoping it was . Well , whatever it is , we 'd better figure it out soon because that ship will reach Earth in two weeks . [ All gasping ] That 's a hell of a slow ship . I know I 've heard that melody before . I just can 't remember where . Hmm . Perhaps we can narrow it down by seeing what part of Fry 's brain becomes active when he hears it . [ Tones playing ] Interesting . I can isolate those tones to a memory Fry formed on December 31 , 1999 . [ Whimpers ] That 's the day I fell in the freezer tube . [ Chewing ] I , too , was on Earth that day , on my mission to ensure Fry 's successful transport to the future . But I recall no such music . I always forget that he can talk . Well , that must be when I heard it . But I guess the memory is gone forever . Like Kaboom cereal . And my family . Oh , fuff . The memory still exists somewhere in your subconscious mind . Amy , prepare the radio-cranial dream injector . Okay . What is it ? Here 's the deal ... We 'll induce a dream state in which Fry will reenact the day of December 31 , 1999 . The rest of us will watch everything on this monitor . Will I have pants on in this dream ? Only if you wear these dream pants . Hey , this is a diaper . Put it on and shut up . Now remember , while you 're in the dream , it 's critical that you locate the source of the music . Ready to go to sleep ? Almost . Can I have some milk and cookies first ? Yes . In syringe form . [ Grunts ] [ Alarm clock ringing ] Huh ? My alarm clock ? Is that the music ? Not even close , you tone-deaf moron . Professor : Now get out of bed and start dreaming . [ Gasps ] My old apartment . My old turtle . My old burrito . My old girlfriend . Old ? Don 't call me old . A lot of young people have false teeth . Don 't worry about it , Michelle . You 're just a dream . In which case , it wouldn 't really be cheating on Leela if we were to ... Leela : Move it along ! [ Church bells ] Nope . [ Bird chirping ] Nope . [ Lullaby playing ] Man , I always wanted to ride in that stroller . But nope . Where could I have heard that music ? Yo , Cosmic F. What up ? Hey , my old break dancing crew . I haven 't seen you guys in years . - What are you up to ? - Nothing but break dancing . Cool . Yo , Noticeably F.A.T. , drop me that one beat that I 'm having a hard time remembering . Word up . That 's why I 'm even in this dream . [ Beat boxing ] Well , there 's no denying that was funky-fresh . But alas , not what I 'm looking for . Damn , don 't nobody like beat boxing no more ? I 'ma go take that job offer at Lehman Brothers . [ Rb music playing ] The neighborhood strip club . I never actually went in there , but it 's worth a shot . Whoa . This place is a lot more nude than I expected . Professor : Fry , you dope . You never went in there , so you can 't remember it . Ah , rats . I wanted lap-dance nachos . [ Melodic chime ] Is that it ? Ah , no , it 's just that ice cream truck that almost ran me over . [ Screaming ] [ Sighs ] Sorry , everyone , no luck yet . [ Yawning ] And I could really use some coffee . No , you need a turkey dinner . You have to get back to dreamland . Why ? I thought that alien ship wouldn 't be here for two weeks . Exactly . And you 've been asleep for 13 and a half days . [ Tones playing ] [ Sirens , tires screeching ] Ow ! Suing ! Ow ! [ Tones playing ] [ Tones playing ] [ Tones playing ] Aw , this never happens , I swear . There 's no time to lose . We 've got to get Fry back into that dream so he can remember where he heard those tones . Stop . I 'd really rather not relive my last day in the past . It was awful . Hanging out with my crazy family , falling in a cryogenic freezer . Can 't you just dissect my brain ? With the building shaking like this ? No chance . Hold out your arm . [ Tones playing ] Wow ! Eeh , my old house . There 's not one thing about this place that I missed . [ Dog barking ] Seymour . I forgot about you . Aw , I missed your stinky breath so much . Maybe I do kind of miss this place . Maybe I just convinced myself I hated it because I knew I could never come back . You know , boy , this was the last time I ever saw my family . [ Sniffling ] [ Sniffing ] [ Barking ] Geez , Philip , I just put Seymour out . Now he 's tracking stink in here . By which I mean you . [ Laughing ] Yeah , Yancy , I stink . Attaboy , Yancy . Gorbachev that forehead up good . Good old , crazy old dad . Go , you bastard . Kick that football . Aw , you blew it again . Hi , mom . Who 's playing ? Nobody . I 'm watching the Charlie Brown special . [ Gasp ] Is that what I think it is ? Yep , your favorite . Captain Crunch casserole . Aw , it 's been a thousand years since I had this . - Can I lick the beaters ? - Well , sure . Just let me unplug it before you ... [ Muffled screaming ] Mmm . Dear God . He 's not looking for the melody at all . He 's enjoying himself . Fry , this is Professor Farnsworth . Get out of your house and keep moving . You 're on a mission . Okay , jeez , give me a minute , will you ? Hey wait , can you guys hear the Professor , too ? - Yep . - Does that seem strange to you ? Well , no , not in a dream . Lots of weird stuff could happen . Philip , have you lost weight ? Damn it , Fry . Stop wasting time with your loved ones and find the source of the music . ♪ ♪ [ Giggling ] [ Blows whistle ] You 'd better eat quickly , Philip . You don 't want to be late for work . You know what ? I don 't want to deliver pizzas tonight . I 'd rather have one last night with my family . You mean before the Y2K turns our computers and waffle irons against us ? Wise choice , son . You 're gonna get fired , Phil . How are you gonna pay off your debt to the Columbia House Record Club if you keep losing jobs ? He 's right . You should go . We 'll still be here tomorrow . Yeah , but what if I 'm not ? I mean , what if I never see you again , mom ? There 's a lot of stuff I want to tell you . Well , like what ? Well ... [ doorbell ringing ] [ Barking ] Oh , sorry to disturb you all , but Fry needs to get going . I was just telling him that , Leela . - Mom ? You know Leela ? - Nope . Leela , what are you doing in my dream ? The Professor sent me in to put an end to this quality time . Please . I need more time with my mom . But it 's not even her . She 's just part of your dream . That 's as close as I 'm gonna get . [ Sighs ] Okay , but hurry . The world 's ending and your dream pants need changing . Listen , mom ... [ doorbell ringing ] Hello . We 're friends of Philip J. Fry . Oh , my God , is that a Captain Crunch casserole ? [ Crunching , slurping ] Stop eating , Zoidberg ! We 're only here to get Fry out of the house . [ Gasps ] Manwiches ? [ Sniffing ] Stop that ! Stop that at once ! Hey , Mr. F. The waffle iron ! It 's turned against us ! [ Explosion , belches ] Excuse me . Mom , listen . Don 't ask how I know , but I 'm never going to see you again . And there 's a lot that I always wished I had said before I ... [ Doorbell rings ] Quit goofing off . You may be asleep , but you 're not on break . This crisis has reached the highest level . Arroo ! Good God , it 's Richard Nixon , our greatest President ! That 's right , daddy-o , and I need to take your hippie son on a far-out musical quest . Get out of my house , you commie . [ Seymour yipping ] No ! I 'm not ready to leave yet . - Mom ! - [ Agnew grunts ] Okay , kid , focus . Where 'd you hear that music ? Sock hop ? Co-ed dorm ? Black panther meeting ? I just want to talk to my mom . Let me back in there , Agnew ! [ Grunting angrily ] It 's no use , Fry . You were never in your house again after 10 : 00 P.M. No ! [ Sobbing ] Cheer up , Fry . I 'll sing you a tune you can identify . ♪ Let 's go already . [ Tones playing ] [ Tones playing ] [ Owls hoot ] I just wanted to talk to my mom . Your mom died hundreds of years ago . Get over it ! Quickly ! We 've got to find the tones and get out of this dream . Fine . I 'll take you to the stupid pizzeria where I worked that night . [ Zapping ] [ Growls ] [ Booming ] You stink , loser . Yeah , yeah . [ Eight-bit melody plays ] [ Gasps ] Is that the music ? No , that 's just the sound the game makes when you get the all-time lowest score . Hey , Fry . Pizza going out . Come on ! [ Seymour whimpering ] I won 't be gone long , Seymour . Just wait here until ... [ Whimpering ] Hold on . This is my dream . You don 't have to wait here . Shrink down and get in my pocket . [ Barks ] [ Panting ] Okay , let 's ride . [ Barks ] Hey , we can 't all fit on that bike . Dream up some kind of luxury vehicle so we can ride in style . [ Bell chimes ] [ Zoidberg panting ] [ Bell chimes ] [ Horn beeps ] What about that non-hovering hover car ? Is that making the music ? It 's called a car . And no . Michelle ! Baby ! Where you going ? It 's not working out , Fry . [ Tires screech ] I put your stuff out on the sidewalk ! Hey , you hussy ! You can 't dump Fry ! That 's my job ! Professor : Hurry ! Only two minutes until midnight ! [ Muzak playing ] [ Shouts ] That music ! That horrible , agonizing music ! - Is that the tune , Fry ? - No . Then stop dreaming it ! [ Music stops ] Hello ? Pizza delivery for ... I.C. Wiener ? Aw , crud . Every time ! [ Slurps , sighs ] It 's no use . Nothing else happened till I fell in the freezer tube . Well , that 's not quite true . Spit it out , pookie . As I mentioned , I was present that night to ensure that Fry fell into the tube . I was standing here . [ Rumbling ] [ Others shouting ] The world outside the dream is cracking apart . Like a delicious frozen Charleston Chew ! Don 't panic . The dream isn 't over yet . Crowd [ Outside ] : Ten , nine , eight ... Okay , now you can panic . The last thing I did was blow my noisemaker sarcastically to underscore my deep disappointment with life . [ Noisemaker toots ] The noisemaker ! Was that it ? Amy , I 'm deeply disappointed in you . [ Blows sharply ] ♪ ♪ [ Tones playing ] [ Two beeps ] [ Distorted ] : I ... Heard ... It ! [ Beeping ] [ Snorts , shouts ] [ Others mumbling groggily ] - That was it ! Did you hear it ? - [ Others murmuring negatively ] - Hear what ? - Just as I was falling into the tube ! I heard the tones , plus two extra notes . Extra notes ? ! That could be a response the aliens are waiting for ! Quickly . To Mount Shushmore ! [ Whizzing ] This is our last chance , Fry ! When the alien ship plays the tone sequence , respond with the exact notes you remembered in your dream or we 're all dead . No pressure . [ Tones playing ] [ Cracks knuckles ] Will you come on ? ! [ High-pitched note rings twice ] [ Deep note booms twice ] [ Whizzing ] - Digby ? - Nibbler ? What is going on here ? Why is a Nibblonian trying to blow us up ? Yes . Why ? I 'm not trying to blow you up . I 'm looking for ... Well , you remember , don 't you , Nibbler ? Well , I ... ahem ... [ mumbles ] It was just over a thousand Earth years ago ... As Lord Nibbler 's personal chauffeur , I landed him on one of your planet 's many rooftops for an important mission . While waiting for him to knock some idiot 's chair over , I suddenly realized I 'd forgotten to lock the ship . [ Tones playing ] [ Ship beeps twice ] We then went out for a well-earned libation . It being the celebration of your planet 's millennium , we soon became somewhat inebriated . [ Burps ] [ Slurred ] : No , you 're drunk . Hey , you remember where we parked ? [ Slurred ] : No . You ? [ Keys clink ] Give me that . You 're in no condition [ Hiccups ] to fly . [ Keys plop in distance ] Bye-bye , keys . [ Sighs ] I remember now . We had to take a cab back to our base on Vergon 6 . The boss gave me a spare key and I began going planet to planet looking for the company car . But why did you have to blast us with that deafening music ? What , you mean the key fob ? - [ Tone sequence plays loudly ] - [ Others shout ] All right , that 's enough of that . I know exactly where you left your ship . [ Crickets chirping ] That 's it all right . Although the cassette player 's been stolen and the battery 's dead . [ Ship starter clicks ] [ Vibrating ] : Aw , yeah . [ Engine starts ] [ Whirring ] Fry , you have once more done my people a great service . On my honor , I shall find a way to repay you . Thanks . But no one can give me what I really want . I can 't stand to see him like this . I 'll push him off the roof . [ Crickets chirping ] [ Groaning ] [ Cheering on tv ] - Hi , mom . - Hi , Sweetie . You want some crackers and a slice of hat ? No , thanks . Listen , um ... I never got the chance to talk to you . Do you have a few minutes ? Sure , honey , you 're the most important thing in my life once this game is over . [ Sighs ] What 's the point ? What good is it to talk to her in my own dream ? Announcer : And that 's it ! Wisconsin has defeated Stanford 17 to 9 in the 2000 Rose Bowl ! What an occasionally exciting way to start the new millennium ! [ Whoops ] Whoa , whoa , whoa , wait a second . I never saw that game . It happened after I got frozen . How can I be dreaming it in such detail ? Because this isn 't your dream . It 's your mother 's dream . Whoa , wh-what ? I told you we would reward you . Make it count , my friend . Mom ? There 's so much I need to say . - Is it really you ? - Yes . I 've dreamed about you a lot since you disappeared .

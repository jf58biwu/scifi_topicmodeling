 'There are unconfirmed reports now of a new outbreak . 'That 's a third outbreak of Russian Flu near Hexham . 'That 's after last night 's outbreaks at Lochinver and Fort William , 'where 12 people are now confirmed dead . 'The government are urging the public not to panic , 'but scenes of disorder are being reported 'in Edinburgh , Sunderland and Perth 'as GP surgeries are besieged with thousands of enquiries . ' It 's all there . Everything they did . The experiments ... the people they murdered , everything . Don 't find out the truth about our father . We need to find out why they want the manuscript . It has the identity of Mr Rabbit . He 's the beating heart of all this , and if we can find his identity , it ends , and you go home . We go and we see if he 's got a Chinese character for " rabbit " carved on his back . And then what ? Whack him ? Tomorrow at noon I 'm good to be here with every ounce of Thoraxin I have . Get me those pages , you get it all . You 're right , it 's better than genocide . That 's my assistant 's e-mail . If you get the manuscript , contact him . I 'll take Grant . He 's going to recognise him . Do you think we can trust him ? Run ! Run ! The purpose of Janus is to sterilise the entire human race . What we have is an approximation . We 're trying it on a test group . And the test group is ... ? The United Kingdom . Where the fuck have you been ? Answer her question ! Last time I saw you , you put a gun to my head . I needed to get the manuscript . I set a trap , you were bait . I 'm sorry , let 's move on . Oh , you are such a fucking twat . Where 's Grant ? At the end of the manuscript ... the Scientist shouts the name of Mr Rabbit . I gave a bunch of pages to Grant , the name was in them . They must be here somewhere . I want those pages . Where is Grant ? Are we going to find Grant ? Alice , we don 't know where he is . I 'm sorry . Hey , you OK ? What ? What do you mean ? Oh , yeah . Just a bit stabbed . What about Janus , is it there ? Wilson , is it in there ? I dunno . Well , there 's this . It 's Carvel . He 's hiding Janus . You can 't see what in , but he says it 's in his " greatest achievement " . And , then there 's this . He 's the god with two faces . Janus . No ! No , no ! That 's our bedding ! For fuck 's sake , pack it in ! Where did he put them ? I want those pages , and I want ... I know ! You want Mr Rabbit . But going off and killing him isn 't going to make your father any less of a cock than he was . You psychoanalysing me , Becky ? We best pals now ? You want to borrow my lipstick ? Shit . Are you wearing make-up ? He thought no-one saw . But he 's rubbish at hiding things . Can we get Grant back now , please ? This is a taser . You did these drawings ? You copied them from the manuscript , didn 't you ? These numbers are a code . We believe it describes the molecular structure of a protein we call Janus . Do you know what Janus is , Grant ? You did a very , very good job . The drawing is excellent . But not complete . There are three five-digit numbers missing . Do you remember them ? Are you sure , Grant ? Because this is very ... ! There 's a theory of mnemonics that states that human minds retain all visual information ever seen in a lifetime . This means you do know the numbers . Mum ! That 's my mum . That 's ... No ! Wave for us , Alexi . Your camera . Wave again , Alexi . There are many commands I can give Alexi . And he will obey them all . The command I would dearly love to give is , " stand down , Alexi . " But that depends on you . Please ! Please don 't hurt my mum , please ! I 'm going to leave the laptop here . And I 'm going to leave this . and when you remember a number , write it in , press this buzzer , and I 'll come back . " Letan " ? So , Letan is Mr Rabbit ? Who 's Letan ? Jessica , who 's Letan ? Jessica , who 's Letan ? I have no idea ! Wilson , do you think you can hack into central records at GCHQ ? No . I mean , yeah , obviously , I can . I need a computer . Not to mention internet . We 'll be outside . That 's not to leave this room . Could say " please . " Please , Becky , don 't take the manuscript out of this room , or I will rip your fucking head off . What about Grant ? We can 't just leave him ! What about Grant ! Holy bloody sweaty bollocks ! Just in here . Thanks . Doctor here ? Is problem ? No , no . It 's just a checkup . We have private cover for you , Anya , so the doctor will be coming to you . Er ... Just wait here , Michael . 'Well , I hadn 't caught anything , I 'd seen ... 'The prime Minister has commended the health Minister , Geoff Lawson , 'for stepping up production of the vaccine , 'describing him as a national hero . 'He said that the Health Department 's contingency planning has 'potentially averted a crisis that none of us could even be to imagine . ' We 're telling people to stay calm . Do not travel unless you absolutely have to . Keep children , the elderly and the most vulnerable at home . We have a vaccine . I repeat , we have a working Russian Flu vaccine , and it will be going out tomorrow morning . You wanted to see me ? I need you to do something . There is a requirement , as part of the procedural safeguards , that the flu vaccine must be independently tested in situ 24 hours before its release . That testing must be verified by the department and of course , to guarantee transparency , it can 't be a minister . It has to be a civil servant . In fact , it has to be the private secretary with responsibility for procurement . I 've supplied a team , they 're downstairs . Don 't question their results . Just sign it off . Jesus . This is why it 's me ? This whole thing has been about that ? 'Your security pass has been given clearance . Go there , get it done . 'Then get on with your life . ' Stay back , stay back over there ! This is all the Thoraxin I have . If I see anything odd , anything that looks like a weapon , it goes in the fucking lake , I swear , do you understand ? Do you have it ? Do have the pages ? What I 've got for you 's in here . What is this , some kind of joke ? No joke . I 've come to say , you 'll get nothing from me , ever again . Are you forgetting what 's in here ? Becky , stop shitting around ! I 've told them I have it – I 've got a meeting arranged ... Then you 'd better run . Then what are you here for ? To ask you for that . To ask you to do one decent thing in your whole life . To ask you ... to give me those drugs . You OK ? I don 't know if the Deel 's has kicked in , you know ? The clumsiness could be psychosomatic , stress , that happens . My dad had full-on fits , that 's how we first knew ... I 'm not going to leave you . I just won 't . Tremors , loss of muscle control , paralysis and eventually suffocation and death . I don 't know if I want to go through all that with someone watching me . Is it a code , then ? Um ... yeah , probably . In part one , people always thought this was binary , but no-one has ever been able to work it out . But ... in this part ... there 's a corresponding page ... The numbers are boring . I like the art . Well , can you get in ? Get in ? I am in . It 's UK security . Practically takes your shoes off and makes you a cup of tea . It 's the searchers that are taking their time . I 'm having to make myself look like a UFO nutter just to get below the radar , which means I 've got to check each database individually . How many databases are there ? 56,000 , or thereabouts . Why don 't you take the mobile unit outside and check the civilian channels ? No . I 'll do it here . I wrote it in . Well , this looks like we 're getting somewhere . Only two to go . No , mate ... I can 't . I 've been trying so hard , but please , I can 't , I can 't ... Please . Then I 'll have to bring your mother in and torture her in front of you . Please don 't make me do that . 'Hello . ' Hi , Anya , it 's Michael . Where is he ? I ... I ... I don 't know , I don 't know ! Christ ! I 'm not ... I 'm not part of them , I 'm just ... Look , look , look ... I was protecting my family ! There 's a woman here who 's having my child , I was just ... I know where the vaccine is ! I can help . Please ! I want to help ! Anya , no ! It 's fine , it 's ... Calm her down ! Calm her the fuck down ! Anya , Anya , please ! It 's fine , it 's OK , he 's not going to hurt us . OK ? He has gun , Michael ... Yeah , I know . I just need to give him some information and then it 'll be OK ... Information ? Anya , please . I swear ! It 'll be OK ! No , whoa ! Anya 's ... pregnant . It 's my child . They blackmailed me . So why are you helping us now ? The vaccine goes out tomorrow . 64 million shots . The warehouse is at 164 Cantwell Way , Stevenage . You got a computer here ? Why ? Google Maps . If there isn 't a warehouse there , I 'll blow your fucking brains out . I 'm sorry . I was trying to protect people . I wanted my family safe ... So you just handed us over ? Michael ... he make trouble , yes ? Please , I not trust ... Anya , please ! It 's all right , I promise ! There . There ... I ... I want to help . I can get you inside , if you just trust me . Anya , no ! Don 't , he 's not ... Anya , no ! Don 't , he 's not what ... I have a situation , I need to speak to Control now . Two minutes , no more , then . You 're ... you 're English ? I ... I don 't ... You 're with them ? Stay quiet if you want to live . Is your name even Anya ? Oh , God , oh , God ... The baby ... is there ... ? Oh , no , but there were scans , I saw scans ... You speak again , I will fire this into your fucking face , understand ? For fuck 's sake ! You OK ? Is she ... We need to go . How 's it going ? I think I found him . It 's the minutes of a Defence Department meeting in 1976 , something called The Committee of Genetic Discovery . The document 's redacted , the only information is formal stuff , like time and place and the names of those attending . None of those names are Letan . But in the footnotes ... a comment attributed to Letan . They changed his name on all official documentation , but ... they missed the footnote . So Letan was there ... He 's one of these people . Mm-hm . All we need to do is pull up their photos . Wilson ... you 've just found Mr Rabbit . There were 18 on the committee . Of those , 14 were men . Six are dead , one 's in a nursing home , leaving these seven . One of them is Letan . One of them is Mr Rabbit . Do you recognise any of these men ? No . None . Do you ? So , what do we do ? We kill them . All of them . Are you serious ? One of them is Mr Rabbit . But six of them aren 't ! It 's called collateral damage . It 's called psychopathy . You can 't just kill them all . I mean , where are they ? How long would that take ? So we make a start . Jessica , you 're too emotionally involved in all this . Excuse me ? I 've read the manuscript , OK ? I know what he did to you . But this weird , freaky , slightly sociopathic , Oedipal thing you 've got going on is putting us all in danger . I swear to Christ , if you don 't stop , if you don 't shut your fucking mouth ... He 's with them ! No , no , Alice ! It 's OK ! It 's all right ! Fuck , Ian , you brought him here ? No , my name is Michael Dugdale . I 'm with the Department of Health . 'Cause that 'll help you when I cut your fucking face off ! I know where the vaccine is . They 're releasing it tomorrow . The whole thing is going out overnight . Tomorrow morning , it 'll start going into people 's arms and there is such a lot of it . There 's 64 million shots . Why have you got a picture of him ? Which one ? That ... That 's Conran Letts ' assistant . He 's the man running Corvadt . Only one number to go , Grant . I know , but ... Can I go home , please ? Absolutely . Of course you can . Jessica , it 's broad daylight . You can 't just go in and whack him . Give me my gun . And what about the warehouse ? And what about the warehouse ? The vaccine is going out tonight . We really need to do something . What is the matter with you people ? How many times do I have to tell you this all stops when he dies ? For God 's sake , this is not what you would normally do . You would at least wait until dark . Give me my gun . My knife can be opening your throat very easily . I don 't think you 'd do that . Ian ? Want to find out ? Guys , I think there 's something you should see . Really . You should really see this . What is it ? It 's a molecule . It 's Janus . This is what they 've been looking for . The vaccine is a test , to see if it works . But this is the real thing . This is the real Janus . You did well to find all this . You 're very clever . Don 't patronise me . I like jigsaws . I 'm sorry about Grant . I thought I was protecting my family . My wife and I we wanted a child very badly . We thought we had one . We had been trying for a very long time . IVF ? My mum said she was going to do that , before I was born . Then I suddenly happened . She said I was a miracle . " Little Mary Miracle " , she called me . It annoyed me . They shot her . I saw it . Would you like to talk about it ? So he experimented on you ? Carvel ? It 's in the manuscript . In the published version , the devil imprisons me . But in the manuscript , it 's my father , holding me , like all the others , to use for experiments . I was hardly a living thing as far as they were concerned . They both deserve death . And you think this is going to make you feel better ? Yeah . Yeah , I do , actually . Who have we got it going to ? 46 scientists , two Nobel Laureates , nine politicians , several police forces and a shedload of journalists . So this is it . We press that button and everything 's out there . All of it . Listen , Ian , do you think this is right ? I mean , Janus is the biggest thing in history , ever . And we 're here , at the centre of it . What are you talking about ? There is a future coming where billions of us are going to be born into poverty . And we are going to murder each other in war for water , food and oil . That is coming . Maybe in our lifetime . The Network 's the enemy . But what if the enemy is right ? Press the button , Wilson . They might think it 's a hoax . Think they 'll take it seriously ? Yeah . At least they will when we burn the warehouse to the ground . I downloaded some blueprints – a map of the Corvadt building , showing the office . I want to go with you . I 'm not going to be much good lugging cans of petrol round a warehouse . Look ... they killed my dad , Jessica . They destroyed my life , too . You ready , then ? You 're very brave . But try not to look so scared . Right . Just hang it there . See ? Don 't get the gun out until you get to the video room . Then you make him disable all relays , OK ? And what if he doesn 't do what I say ? Hit him with the gun . What , like with the fat end ? Yeah . The fat end . All right ? OK . Thank you . I 've seen one of these before . They 're based on the Y-GAN protocol , which is actually quite sloppy . If we can access the reader , then maybe we can ... Or , yeah , we could just do that . I don 't get why there 's no guards . I don 't get it . You didn 't send the email ? I freed Letts . And I pushed the knife into my own stomach because they are right . Just give me the manuscript . This isn 't right . This is just cohesi-9 modified . That 's the number , mate . That is the one , I swear . But I got a number wrong when I drew it so I changed that . Look . Which one ? Which one 's wrong ? That one . Look . We can 't be the people that destroys humanity 's chance at life . We can 't . I 'm not giving it to you . Jessica , please don 't . Please don 't . Stand down , Alexi . Jessica . This is my Dad . It 's all I 've got . I 'm not giving him to you . Please . Are you all right ? Grant ? Have you seen this man ? He 's dead . I killed him , Jessica . Come on . What about Wilson ? What about Wilson ? Is this all of them ? It is . That was all we were told . Are you sure ? I don 't want any nasty surprises . Jessica Hyde , for example . She 's not with these . Please , Alice . What ? The girl . Don 't make her see . Yes , of course . Alice , is it ? Mm-hmm . Now what I want you to do is to pop in there , close your eyes very tight and count to 99 . Will you do that for me ? And Alice , it 's very important that you don 't run or hide , OK ? Good girl . You ... you 're not going to kill us ? Why would I kill you ? But you sent Alice in ... She 's 12 . Christ , Ian , what do I have to do to convince you people I 'm on your fucking side ? We thought you were dead ! Well , apparently I 'm not . We haven 't much time . I understand you have petrol ? Grant ! Where 's Wilson ? Fuck . All right then , shithead ... Let 's give it a go . No-one 's come . They know we 're here and must know we did it , but no-one 's come for us . We 're going to Fortingall . The Highlands of Scotland , we 're catching a train to Glasgow . Bit remote , isn 't it ? Yes . Leona said to give it a month before returning . We 're pretending it 's a holiday . That 's how long she reckons they 'll need to mop up everyone else , if ... She has the manuscript . We have to give it to her . Jessica . She needs it to end all this . So , what ? Alice is going with him ? Yeah . She wants to . She 's alone . They want a child . Yeah , but he 's a cock . I don 't reckon she 'll go with him . Are you all right to come with us ? Just until we get all this sorted and get you back to your mum ? I don 't reckon she 'll go with him . Yeah , it 's probably for the best . You going with that dickhead ? I 'll miss you , twat . Jessica . It is so good to meet you . It 's fine . I 'll take you through . I promise you , it 'll be fine . It 's in there ? The last thing we want is for what 's in that manuscript to become public knowledge . This way I can use it , then destroy it . Jessica ... It needs to be like this . I 'm just going to get the tickets , all right ? Wait here , I 'll get us a secure room . When you 're ready , you can show me . Does that sound OK ? Do you need anything ? Tea , or ... ? No , thank you . Argh ! Becky ... Becky ! Becky ! Help ! Jesus Christ ! She just started , I don 't know what happened . She just started ... Becky . Is she OK ? Becky , Becky . Are you all right ? Is your head all right , did you bang your head ? Did I fit ? Was that a fit ? Did I fit , Ian ? Shh ... Ian ... Ian ... We 'll get you some help . All right ? Can I have some water , please ? Please ... Sit with her . Don 't leave her . Are you all right ? Ta , Paul . 'My dad wrote it down . 'It is so good to meet you . 'People always let you down . 'This way I can use it ... ' 'It 's called tonalite gneiss . 'Where did you get that ? 'From a rock plateau in Canada . 'He used to say , ' " This rock gives you permission to do anything . " 'Is this the rabbit ? 'Are you sure you don 't remember the name of Mr Rabbit ? 'This all stops when he dies . 'Who 's Mr Rabbit ? 'I have no idea . 'There were 18 on the committee . Of those , 14 were men . 'He 's one of these people . 'All we need to do is pull up their photos . 'Do you recognise any of these men ? 'One of these is Mr Rabbit . 'I have no idea . 'There 's a story about how he got his name . 'He was playing everyone against each other . 'She 's like us , works in secret . 'Trusts no-one . 'Who 's Mr Rabbit ? 'Milner , her name 's Milner ... Stop ! Oh , our train is leaving . But ... Go find Ian . But he said , " Stay with you . " Quick ! Quick , or we 'll miss it . Becky says the train 's leaving now . What ? It 's not for another ten ... Stay here , don 't move . Just stay here ! You can go . Who did Grant kill ? A man so dedicated to the cause that he carved lines into his own flesh to act as cover . That 's how important this is , Jessica . But you helped burn the warehouse , the vaccine , you destroyed it ... The vaccine may well have worked . It may not have . We never had the genius of your father . Once I found out that he had finished Janus , I knew that was all that mattered . His work , Jessica . Yeah , well , fuck you . Fuck both of you , it 's over . I burned it . I destroyed your work , Janus is gone ! That ? Oh , that 's just a bunch of old drawings done by a crazy man . I only wanted that because I knew you 'd be the one bringing it . Argh ! Sorry . I don 't want you jumping . From the moment you were born he just fell in love . He considered you his 'greatest achievement ' . And that 's where he hid Janus . It 's in me ? You should be happy . Isn 't that what you 've always wanted ? Daddy 's love ? Daddy loved you so much he hid the most important thing the world has ever known in you . We 'd better get started , you and I. We have so much to do .

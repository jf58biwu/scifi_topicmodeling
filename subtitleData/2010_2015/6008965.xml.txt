 A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Big Jim threw the egg off the cliff . That proves it 's the power source . - The dome 's contracting . - You mean it 's shrinking ? At its present rate - it won 't be long before the dome ... - Crushes us ? - This is your fault . - Where 's Melanie ? I painted a vision . It may show us how to save her . Grab my hand . In my dream , I saw Melanie disappear , - but I didn 't know it meant that . - I love you . You know why ? Because she 's supposed to be with me , Jim . We have to go after Melanie . It 's too dangerous . No one 's going anywhere . Can you see anything ? No . Oh , my God . There 's another earthquake . Where do you think the crater leads ? Maybe it 's another tunnel , like at school . It could lead to Zenith . Or somewhere else . Anywhere but here would be great . We gotta check it out , but we gotta do it right . Not risking anyone else 's life . Help me ! Help ! Pauline . Pauline . Lay her down on her side . Hunter , I need your shirt . - What happened ? - Lyle . Lyle stabbed her . - Where is he now ? - He 's dead . Here . - I tried to stop the bleeding . - Our supplies are at the school . - Well , let 's get there now . - Prius is at the edge of the woods . Julia . - I 'm right here . After I was stabbed , I had a vision . The dome chose you . But you 're not alone . There 's someone else , but I can 't see his face . He ... He doesn 't know he 's the one . Come on , get the stretcher underneath her . I gotta keep pressure on this wound . - Rebecca , you 're coming with us . - Okay . Make some room . Here we go . Yeah , I got it . Ready ' ! One , two , three . Up . Keep breathing . What 's happening ? - The walls are getting closer . - The dome 's a sphere . It 's contracting horizontally and vertically . I think it 's shutting down . Everything inside is going haywire . We gotta get some gear so we can explore this crater . Help ! We need help ! It 's near the Tilden farm . I thought we got everybody in town . Tom must have gone back for something . Hey , keep an eye on Hunter . - Don 't do anything stupid . - Wait . Where are you going ? We need to get a tablet . What for ? When this thing opened , it might have created a crack . Which means we might get a Wi-Fi signal . Maybe we can get a message to the Hounds of Diana . If the Hounds tell us Melanie 's in Zenith , that means the water 's our way out . Help ! Help ! Aah ! - What happened ? - The shaking ... It fell . - It 's crushing my leg . - Help my dad . - Please . - Get my son out of here . - No , I need to help . - Go with Julia , son . - You 're coming with us . - Tom , I 'll look after him . Get him out of here . Let 's try this . I love you , buddy . Go with Julia . Not leaving without you . He 's gonna help . Try again . Here we go . - Aah ! Go ! Get out ! Go ! Get out ! Daddy . No . Dad . No . No . No . No . - I think Joe 's right . - The dome 's shutting down . - Dad , no ! - I 'm guessing we got a few hours . - No ! Dad ! No ! - Come on , bud . I know , buddy . - Please , no . Dad . Dad . Come on , guys . Let 's go . We got an injured person here . Let 's get her up . Get as much gauze as you can find . Get a table . Move it over here . Her abdomens rigid . She 's bleeding internally . Lyle might have lacerated an organ . Kidney , maybe , or her liver . I know you can help . Do something . - She needs surgery . - Operate . Do whatever you have to . I 'm not a surgeon . And we don 't have anesthesia or equipment . I can 't even tell which organ is injured without an MRI . Listen , there is an answer . Find it ! - Please , you have to help her . - I 'm doing everything I can . No signal . I 'm sorry . It was a good idea though . So the crater didn 't create a crack in the dome and there 's no new tunnel . Maybe it did , but someone is blocking the signal . Yeah , or it 's nothing but a giant killer suck hole . We 're literally hours away from being crushed to death . Maybe I should go find my mom and spend my last few hours with her , instead of trying to convince myself that whoever or whatever controls this dumb dome even gives a crap about any of us . Norrie , I need you here with me , okay ? - Hey . Hey , what are you doing ? - Plan B. Joe , you 're not going down there . This is my town . Yours too now . If we don ' ! do anything , we all die . If we explore the crater , we might be able to save everyone . He 's right . We know the dome better than anyone . You okay , Pauline ? What happened ? Lyle tried to take you away from me . He stabbed you . He 's dead now . No . Everything 's gonna be okay , I promise . Mm-hm . Can we give her something for the pain ? We have morphine . Just 10 milligrams , okay ? - Jim ? - Yeah ? - We should talk . - Okay . I 'll be right back . She looks good . On the mend . The internal damage is too massive - to control without surgery . - So do something else . I can keep her as comfortable as possible . But there 's nothing I can do to stop her from bleeding out . What are you saying ? That she 's gonna die ? If there was something else , anything , I would do it . I don 't accept that . Pauline came back to save us , not bleed out in front of her son . The dome won 't let her die . This is just another test . My family , my wife , we were chosen . We gotta get Mom back to the crater . Melanie didn 't just disappear into thin air . It must lead somewhere . I hope it does , Junior . But Pauline 's injuries are too severe . If we move her , it will accelerate the bleeding . Well , tell me what we can do . - She needs fluids . - Where do I get saline ? - Clinic ? - I 'll find it . It is another tunnel . But it 's different than the one underneath the school . What are those things ? I don 't know . But they 're cool . Yeah , and kind of terrifying . All right , let 's do this . Maybe we can figure out what happened to Melanie . Be careful . Come on . - You okay , Mom ? - Just a little pain . Can we give her some more morphine ? We don 't wanna give her an overdose . No , Junior . It 's okay . - Dad 's coming back . - Mm . Okay ? We 're gonna fix you up . Just like Melanie . Do you think she 's okay ? That she made it out ? Anything 's possible . Mm . My brushes . And canvas . - What do you mean ? - Maybe I can paint the way out . Junior , it 's important . Go get them . James . We 've been through so much . I got to see my sweet , sweet boy become a man . I love you , Mom . I love you . Forever . What you said to Junior , it sounded like a goodbye . We both know the truth . I 'm not going to make it . We just have to get you stable . If the craters the way out , we 'll take you . No . The dome 's done with me . I saw my own death . - Pauline . - All that matters is Junior . That he survives . And Jim won 't let me go . I don 't want that . - What are you saying ? - Let me go peacefully . Becky . Help me . Please . I think you were supposed to be here for this . I don 't know about that . I gotta go grab that gear , get back to the crater . - Figure out what 's down there . - We should split up . I 'll take Aidan back to the high school while you head back . Well , wait for me at the school , all right ? Grab a walkie from Sam . I 'll be in touch . All right , honey . We 're gonna head this way , okay ? What do we do about this fork ? - Which way ? - I have no idea . Joe , look . I think we just made our decision . How long do you think the crater 's gonna stay open ? I don 't know . Not long . We gotta tell Barbie . There might be a way out . Come on . Norrie . Come on , jump . Come on , let 's go . Hey . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - We went down . - Yeah , I see that . What part of " don 't do anything stupid " did you not understand ? Don 't be pissed . We couldn 't wait . We found more tunnels . There was a monarch down there too . It showed us a path with a light at the end . Did you see where it goes ? We had to get out . Things are shaky down there . The passage may not be open for long . But it goes somewhere . And , like I said before , anywhere is better than here . And it doesn 't look like your dad 's showing up with the egg . The time between these contractions is getting shorter . And the dome 's making the weather worse . All right , well , we 're going down the crater . It 's our only shot . Julia . I think we got another chance . - This might be the way out of here . - Thanks . Sam . Rebecca . The crater could be the way out . We gotta gather the town . Okay , well , most everyone 's either here or at the Sweetbriar or the church . Round them up . We gotta get everybody to the woods . How ? All right . School busses . They run on diesel , there 's a whole fleet . Gotta be fuel left in some of them . I 'll check . Gather the wounded , get them on first . All right , anyone who can 't fit on the buses will just walk . Jim , what are you doing here ? I 'm looking for saline . Someone 's hurt . Didn 't you hear the plan ? We 're leaving . Everyone . - Did you find any saline ? - No . Leave it . We have to round everyone up . Julia said there isn 't much time . Listen , if I don 't find that saline , my wife dies . I knew it . It was waiting for me . Hey . Your mom 's here . Julia wants our help loading up the busses . What 's wrong ? Do you really think we 're gonna get out ? I mean , the tunnels are freaky , but , yeah , we 'll make it . It 's not the tunnels . It 's what 's after that . Am I just supposed to go back to my life in California ? Without my mom ? How can I go and just leave her here ? She 's not here . Neither is Angie . They might be buried in Chester 's Mill , but they 'll always be with us . Do you know why I was going to boot camp ? Why I 'm here in the first place ? I assumed you got into some kind of trouble . I punched some stupid girl in the mouth and knocked her tooth out . And all she did was make fun of my hair . It 's just so stupid to think how much I cared . - If I had just ignored her ... - No , the dome wanted you here . It would 've found another way . I don 't care what the dome wanted . Because I just want my mom . Sometimes I think on Dome Day , if Angie and I just went to brunch with my mom ... But then I never would 've met you . My mom told me before she died to be brave . And I just don 't feel brave right now . Look , I don 't know what 's gonna happen . But whatever 's out there , we 're gonna face it together . Okay . No . No . Pauline ? There 's news . The passage you opened ? We 're evacuating everyone through it . So if you can just hold on , we can try to get you to a doctor . Oh . I won 't make it . I 'll only slow down the people I love . It 's just a little longer . You can do it . No , this is what the dome wants . I paid for my sins . For once , I 'll be able to sleep without dreaming . No , there 's hope now . We 're only getting out because of you . Good . Junior will be safe . This is so much pain . Please be kind . Please . Oh , sweet girl . What a sweet girl . Can you help me and make sure everyone has a seat ? - Yeah , okay . - Thanks , Aidan . Rain . Because it wasn 't enough of a mess already ? The dome 's contractions must be messing with the weather patterns or something . No . Come with me now . I told you a hundred times , I need to stay here . - I 'm one of the four hands . I 'm sorry . - I 'm not asking you , Eleanor . Hey , hey , hey . Norrie , do me a favor , okay ? Get on this first bus . I 'm really gonna need your help - once we get to that crater . - Okay . Thank you . Okay , come on . Julia . Have you seen Andrea ? She 's getting supplies . She 's gonna meet us at the crater . All right , don 't stop . Let 's go . Keep moving . Load up . Keep moving . Hey , where 's Pauline ? She 's still inside . We 're waiting for Jim to get back . Well , he better hurry with that saline . How is your sister ? Let me through . Hey , I got the saline . - I got the saline . Come on . - We gotta hurry . Do what you can for Pauline and then let 's go . I 'll see you soon . Baby . I got it for you . I found the stuff you need . I told you the dome was looking after us . Pauline . I 'm back , honey . Sam , my pain is gone . Oh , that 's good , that 's good . That 's real good . I told you it 's gonna be okay . I know you love me . - I 'm sorry . - You don 't need to be sorry . You don 't need to be sorry . Pauline ? Look at me . - What 's wrong ? - Her pulse is dropping . Oh , and take care of Junior . - Pauline . - I love you all . I just got you back . You did this . She said it was what the dome wanted . She begged me . You always have the solutions , don 't you ? It was a kind thing to do . I 'm sorry . Always got something in your back pocket for every emergency . It was her last request . Oh , now you can kill ? When it 's my wife ? Jim , if Pauline thought that this is what the dome wanted ... The dome wanted my family together . And you got in the way . Walk away , Jim . Go find Junior and get him out of here . I 'll miss my wife forever . No one 's gonna miss you . Mom ? Mom . Mom . Oh , my God . Sam . You okay ? Get up . What happened ? Oh , my God . No . Where 's Mom ? She 's gone . - What do you mean ? - Pauline asked Rebecca to help her end her life . She was in so much pain . Jim went after Rebecca . I tried to stop him . I couldn 't . I 'm so sorry , Junior . Mom was trying to say goodbye . - I should 've known . - We gotta find your dad . He 's gone crazy . We gotta talk him down . Why would I do that ? There 's no talking to him . There 's only dealing with him . Why 'd you paint that , Pauline ? I wish you hadn 't . Dome ? I 'll make you a deal . If you bring her back right now , I won 't murder every single one of your special little friends . I won 't slit Julia 's throat , shoot Barbie in the heart or burn those kids alive . Okay ? You got three seconds . Okay , then . I 'm gonna free you from all this , so you can go right through the dome wall . And it 's gonna regret what it did to us . I promise . This is the same plan that we had before . We 're all gonna break up into small groups keeping your family with you . We will call you forward one by one and get you down . Once your entire group is down , Joe and Norrie here will guide you into the ... How do you know this is safe ? I know because I 've done it before . And look , I know you 're all scared . Okay ? I know that I 'm a stranger . But for the last two weeks , we have fought together for the survival of this town . But right now , I need you to trust me , because we don 't have another choice . If we stay here , we die . Now , come on . Let 's get out of here . Mommy , I 'm scared . - Carolyn , listen , I need you to go down with me . Okay ? Help me keep everyone calm . Julia , Hunter , hey . Can I get you guys to stay at the top here ? All right ? Keep everything orderly . Make sure we don 't leave anyone behind . Am I forgetting anything ? No . You 're doing exactly what you 're supposed to . I love you . I love you too . All right , you guys ready ? Let 's do it . All right , everybody , group one . Stick with me . Just stay calm , all right ? We 're gonna be fine . Let 's go . You heard him . Keep moving . Hold on . Hold on . It 's okay , guys . We 've been here before . There 's no need to be afraid . Careful . All right , Carolyn . Stop . - The cracks are getting wider . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . You 're fine , you 're fine . All right , everybody , watch your step , all right ? We 'll help you across . Okay , how we doing ? Most folks are accounted for . Julia . Please be there . Andrea ? What 's wrong ? Where are you ? I 'm at my house . I need help . I ... Oh , God . Andrea ? Andrea . Andrea . Andrea ? Andrea ? In here . I knew you 'd come running . Put the bat down . Julia ? Come in . Less is more . Julia . Hey , Sam . What do you need ? You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just helping Andrea . We 're headed back now . Junior and I are at the crater with Hunter . Listen , you should know , uh , Pauline is dead . And Jim killed Rebecca . He 's out there somewhere . Gotta go now , Sam . What are you doing , Jim ? Payback . Against me ? What did I ever do except be your neighbor and friend ? It 's not about you , honey . Sam forgot to mention that Rebecca murdered Pauline . Yeah . I gave the dome a chance to return her to me . But it declined . Which is bad for you . Killing me won 't bring Pauline back . Yeah , but it might ruin some of the dome 's plans , and that 's good enough . Andrea was your friend . Yeah , I know . That 's why I killed her quick . You don 't get that privilege . You know why the dome didn 't bring Pauline back ? Because you 're a joke . Because the dome doesn 't make deals with insects like you . Even your wife knew you were meaningless . I 'll like you a lot better when your mouth 's broken . All right , everybody . Come on . Keep moving forward . Keep moving forward , you 'll catch up with the next group , all right ? Let 's go . Everything 's gonna be fine . All right , Julia , how many we got left ? Uh , only a few . I 'm sending them down now . - Where 's Julia ? - She left to help a friend . Where is she right now ? I don 't know . She 's not answering her walkie . Julia . Here ! You Okay ? Jim killed Andrea . He 's behind me . - Junior . - Go without me . - No . I 'm not gonna let you go alone . - I said go . Put your arm around me . What are you doing , son ? I 'm not your son anymore . I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else . How you gonna do that ? You 're not leaving this town . You don 't tell me what to do . Not you , not the dome . This is my town , little boy . Enjoy what 's left of it . Oh , God . You made it . What happened ? - Jim . - Where is he ? Barbie , there 's no time . Junior 's taking care of it . Jim 's not getting down here . All right , I 'll take her . Let 's go . Can you take Aidan up ahead ? You just go on , all right ? I 'll be right behind you . Okay . Come on . Hunter , go up front with Joe and Norrie . - Tell them to move out , all right ? - Okay . We 'll catch up . Nice and slow . Junior ! You all right ? You 're gonna have to jump . You think you can do it ? - Yeah , I can make it . - Okay . I 'll get across and I 'll give you a hand . All right , come on . Step up , give me your hand . Okay . I can 't make it . No . There 's gotta be another way . I 'm not leaving you here . You don 't have a choice . The town needs your help . And fast , before the tunnels cave in on them . - The dome chose you . - Barbie , listen to me . Pauline had a vision of someone guiding everyone out of the dome . She didn 't see his face , but it 's you . But everything we 've done for this town we 've done together . It 's okay , the dome has gotten us this far . I have faith that if you do what it 's asking , it will protect me . I 'm coming back for you . I know . Junior ! Junior , you can 't leave me ! Junior ! Barbie , where 's Julia ? She 's coming . She sent me up ahead . - Why is everybody stopped ? - Nobody knows which way to go . Barbie , we need to go this way . We saw the butterfly go down there . I think it 's a sign . Both Joe and I do . All right , this is the way , okay ? Everybody follow me . What happened ? Barbie went ahead . He 'll come back for us . Then we 'll figure out a way across . No , this can 't be all that 's there . - It can 't be . - Is this a cave-in ? Barbie , what do we do now ? I don 't ... I don 't know . No , we didn 't come all this way for a dead end . Screw you ! Can you hear me ? Whoever you are controlling all of this , can you just talk to us and tell us what 's going on ? How did you ... ? I have no idea . What 's that noise ? Melanie ? Follow me . We 're going home .

 NARRATOR : Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be . [ RUMBLING ] Until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . [ THUMP ] [ COW MOOING ] Invisible , indestructible and completely inescapable . We 're trapped . NARRATOR : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . JULIA : Who the hell are you ? BARBIE : Barbie . People just call me Barbie . It 's a nickname . My husband isn 't here , but he 'll turn up , you 'll see . What do we do when people ask about the propane ? - That 's your business . - Heh , heh , heh . Duke , is it your pacemaker ? - Ah ! - Stop ! No one can hear us all the way down here . ANGIE : Let me out of here ! Ah ! - Junior . - Dad . JULIA : You can stay with me . Come on , I 'll give you the nickel tour . Unh ! - Where is it ? - I don 't have it . Yeah ? My boss is not gonna like that . You got one day . You hear me ? Listen , all you gotta do is pay up . You might wanna think about it . You don 't wanna do anything stupid . [ GUNSHOT ] [ PANTING ] [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Yeah ? - You all right ? - Yup , fine . You were talking in your sleep . Yelling , actually . - Is that thing still out there ? - Yeah , looks like it . The hazmat suits haven 't left . Julia , thanks again for letting me crash here . With my husband missing and everything that happened today , it was nice to have the company . - I 'll see you in the morning . - Great . Did you lose something ? You didn 't happen to see a pair of dog tags around anywhere , did you ? No , but I 'll keep an eye out . Night . [ SIREN WAILING ] FREDDY : Linda , Linda ! - What the hell happened ? - Who shot Duke ? No one shot Duke , Paul . Calm down . He just got close to this thing and his pacemaker exploded . [ DOME HUMMING AND FREDDY GRUNTS ] Holy ... If this thing blows up mechanical things , then why didn 't Freddy 's watch explode ? It 's a windup . It must only affect things with batteries . Either way , just check the road blocks , make sure nobody gets near this thing . PAUL : Who 's in charge now ? - You 're a cop . Do your job . - What about me ? - We need to take care of Duke . BEN : Joe , wait up . - I 'm fine . BEN : No , you 're not . An hour ago you were having a seizure , flopping around like a fish on a hook . Did I say anything ? Yeah , something about stars , pink stars . - Anything you wanna tell me ? - No . - Hey , any luck , you guys ? MAN : Not yet . This thing goes down far . Oh , my God , you know what all this means ? We 're so not having that trig test tomorrow . - Trig . That 's a great idea . - It is ? I could totally map this thing , see if there 's any holes . - I 'm coming with you . - Dude , you don 't have to . Buddy , Lewis had Clark , you got me , all right ? Come on . Did you hear anything more about the military on that contraption of yours ? Nope , I lost the signal , but I 'm trying to get it back . It 's not as easy as cueing up the next Van Halen track . Now , why is it that engineers always act superior to DJs ? Because we 're smarter , Phil . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Negative , sir . Fire is ineffective against the surface , but we can confirm there is no radioactivity emanating from the dome . They did it again . Second time in 24 hours they called it a dome . Yeah , I heard them . No , I don 't think you did , because you 'd be freaking out too . We 're under a dome , Dodee . Now , this is not just some invisible wall where a chopper can drop in and rescue us , man . - We gotta tell people . - And we will . It 's just right now we only know enough to scare the crap out of them . To be continued . [ ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ] [ MUSIC STOPS ] Faithful insomniacs , Phil Bushey here . It 's been a long night , and if you 're listening to me , it 's because you 've got no choice . You see , this barrier thing is blocking all of the cell phones , TV , Internet . Everything in our humble burg of Chester 's Mill . Theories about what 's causing this range from the North Koreans to a breach in the space-time continuum ... JIM : Sorry I didn 't get to you sooner . Had to make sure the clinic and nursing home were taken care of . You 're kidding me . If you 're not careful , people are gonna start calling you Santa Claus . [ SWITCH CLICKS ] Oh , God bless you , Jim Rennie . How much do I owe you ? JIM : Ho-ho-ho . Oh , my God . The lights are back . Did that invisible wall come down ? Well , I 'm afraid not , but we got gennies up and running . So we have some power . At least get back to some sense of normal . I don 't believe we 've met . Councilman Jim Rennie , this is Carolyn and her partner , Alice . They 're staying in my spare room upstairs . They 're in from L.A. We got trapped driving through your little town . - We 're taking our daughter Norrie to ... - To camp . But we have to get out of here . Our daughter is sick . - She had a seizure . - Does your girl have epilepsy ? No , it can happen to anyone . Caffeine , sleep deprivation . - I 've seen it in my patients . - She 's a psychiatrist . Well , I 'm sorry you ladies aren 't discovering Chester 's Mill under better circumstances , but trust me , if you 're gonna be stuck somewhere , this is the place to be . I 've lived here my entire life and no place I 'd rather call home . Jim , I need you to come with me . Duke 's dead . Look at me , damn it ! Anyone ? I wouldn 't even bother . You could strip naked in front of these guys . They 're still not gonna pay attention . I tried that an hour ago . They didn 't even blink . Oh , I looked around , by the way , but no sign of your dog tags . Oh , yeah , no worries . You know what ? I probably just left them in my car . So , what makes you think these guys are under orders not to talk to us ? Because they 're not talking to us . Maybe they did this , you know . Maybe they 're responsible . - And why would they do that ? - I don 't know . Could be an experiment . Some sort of portable detention camp . Maybe we 're being used as guinea pigs . Whatever it is , these guys are the reason my husband is trapped out there . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] - Where are you heading ? - The radio station . They might not be talking to us , but they 're talking to somebody . [ DOOR RATTLING ] I told you , you 're safe with me . ANGIE : Mr. Rennie ! Mr. Rennie ! Ah ! [ POUNDING ON DOOR ] - Mr. Rennie ! Mr. Rennie ! - Angie , my dad 's not home . - Mr. Rennie , help ! - My dad 's not home ! Mr. Rennie ! Let go of me ! Let go ! No ! No ! No ! [ ANGIE GRUNTING ] - What the hell do you want from me ? - Look , I just want you to go back to being the Angie I knew before yesterday . We were doing great and then this thing comes down and you tell me to take a hike . I think it scrambled your brain . One of us has a scrambled brain , all right . You can 't see it , but I can . You 're sick , Angie , but I 'm gonna make you better . If I 'm so sick , then why don 't you take me to the hospital ? - If you care about me so much . - Because he might still be there . - Who might still be there ? - The guy I saw you with . - What guy ? - Yesterday , outside the hospital . Barbie . The guy who came in with Mrs. Shumway ? - I don 't even know him . - Don 't play dumb with me , Ange . - I can see right through you . - All he did was give me a cigarette . Uh-huh . What did I ever do to you ? - You loved me . - No . - Junior , I never ... - Yes , Angie , you did . And when this thing comes down , you 're gonna love me again . I will never love you ! You were right . That guy at the hospital , we didn 't just share a cigarette . He screwed my brains out and I loved it . I loved it more than I ever did with you . You 'll never be the man that he is . Junior ! Junior ! Holy hell . He was a good man . I loved him . He was like a father to me . He was a good friend . Just before he died , he tried to tell me something . Tried telling you what ? He said there were things that I didn 't know about Chester 's Mill . Things that he needed to protect me from . What did that mean ? I wish I could tell you . What am I gonna do with another body ? Cemetery 's outside the barrier , my freezer 's full . JIM : Show some respect . This isn 't just another body . - This is Duke Perkins . LESTER : What 's that ? Turn up your hearing aid , Lester . I said , this is Duke Perkins . Oh , no . Oh , good Lord . Deputy Esquivel , I 'm so sorry for your loss . Thank you , Reverend Coggins . I should get back out there . You 're right , Linda . Go out there and do your job . I 'll make sure Duke here gets taken care of . You 're using our stuff . You 're high as a kite . So what ? It 's judgment day , Jim . I might as well be feeling the rapture . The only reason we got into this was to try to save Chester 's Mill . No , that 's the reason Duke went along with it . You and I , we had other priorities . All right ? I mean , at least now we don 't have to worry about him talking . Real man of God there , rev. - Come on , let 's go . - What ? Where are we going ? To clean up our mess . Dude , found a way out . Check it . - Heh . You 're such an idiot . - Ha , ha , ha . BARBIE : It 's Joe , right ? - Yeah , McAlister . Dude , this is the guy who saved my ass when that plane went down . He totally said it was raining arms and legs . Yeah , you could say that . What are you up to ? So far I marked these points . By measuring the distance between them , I was able to come up with the Y coordinate . And then by multiplying it by its K integer ... He connected the dots . It 's totally gonna be a circle . So far it looks like it 's about 10 miles across . It covers the entire Mill , including some of Lake Eastpoint . - And you did this ? - Yeah , but we 're being really careful . Keep it up . - Where did that guy come from ? - Definitely not from around here . How do you know ? Because he 's cool . - Come on , Dodee , you just had them . - Patience , Phillip . [ STATIC OVER RADIO ] - Did you get something ? - Shh . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Air traffic has been rerouted around Chester 's Mill until further notice . We will continue to monitor the air space . JULIA : What the hell is that ? Jim , what are you doing ? I was , um , looking for that . It 's Duke 's will . Go ahead , read it . [ SNIFFLING ] He , uh , left me his house . Everything . Of course he did . He treated you like the daughter he never had . [ SIGHS ] [ LINDA SOBBING ] LINDA : Now what do we do ? That 's a close call , no thanks to you . What was I supposed to do , phone you ? - So , what did you find out ? - Nothing to do with propane . Duke must have kept the records at his house . Yeah , it 's not his house anymore . He left it to the girl . So you better get over there before she does . - Me ? What are you gonna do ? - My job , Lester . Now get out . I 'm the only councilman left in Chester 's Mill . Got a town to take care of . JULIA : You made this ? - Yeah , I 'm only three credits short of my master 's degree in electrical engineering . JULIA : Wow . - Yeah . - How does it work ? Well , this is a harmonic microwave frequency converter . It turns low frequency waves into high frequency waves so that we can hear ... - Maybe you should just let me hear it . - Okay , sometimes it 's hard to pick up . [ STATIC ON RADIO ] MAN [ ON RADIO ] : Further tests reveal the dome appears to be impervious to high-energy lasers and all class-8 corrosive chemicals . - We 're under a dome . - Yeah , that 's what they keep calling it . - Why haven 't you told anybody ? - We 're not a news station . Hey , Phil . That was some face-melting rock ' n ' roll brought to you by ... - I 'm going on . DODEE : I tried to stop her . - I 'm sorry , what are you doing ? JULIA : Going on the air . No , you can 't . This is Julia Shumway from The Weekly Independent . I have some news for all of us stuck here inside Chester 's Mill . I have just learned that the barrier around Chester 's Mill is being called a dome . This information appears to be coming from military sources positioned just outside Chester 's Mill , just outside the dome . We will keep updating you as information comes in . So stay tuned to ... WYBS , your only source of news from under the dome . - What does that mean ? - I have no idea . I do , Mom . It means we 're all gonna die in here . ROSE : This dome thing , how big is it ? - No idea . - We 're under a dome ? MAN : We gonna run out of air ? Until I find out where Julia got this information , I think it 's best that we just all stay calm . - What if it collapses on us ? - Great , now the sky is falling . If we keep our heads and we stick together , we 'll get through this . Hey , " We 'll get through this " ? You don 't know what this dome thing might do . Right , but the last thing we need right now is for people to panic . That thing took Duke . Who 's next ? Pull yourself together and get out on patrol . People are scared and when people are scared they start acting stupid . Yeah , you 'd have to be stupid not to be scared . You know , I just hope someone tries to blow this damn thing up . - Do you think he 's gonna be okay ? - He 's gotta be . We 're gonna need every man we got . Think we 'll ever see him again ? Who , Rusty ? Come on , Linda . My brother is not gonna let some magic bubble thing keep him from seeing you again . That is Rusty . And you know , I probably shouldn 't be telling you this , but he 's taking you to Hawaii for your honeymoon . That dog told me that I had to settle for Niagara Falls . LINDA : Reverend . - Hey , how you holding up ? Got our hands full , but I think we 'll make it . Yeah , you 're in my prayers . JULIA [ OVER RADIO ] : Julia Shumway back with an update . Additional reports suggest that the dome is not radioactive , but residents are advised to continue to keep a safe distance . PHIL : And now something to take our minds off all this trouble . [ HORN HONKING ] JIM : Hey ! [ HORN HONKING ] JIM : Hey , hey ! Stop , stop ! - What the hell are you doing ? ! - I 'm digging my way out . - No , you 're not . - What the hell ? Any machine touches that dome , you 're fried . - Says who ? - Duke . His pacemaker blew right out of his chest . He 's dead . Duke 's dead ? Who 's in charge ? What if we 're trapped in here forever ? I 'll never get to make out with Mila Kunis . I don 't think this thing is the only thing keeping that from happening . Let 's think about it . We could 've met every girl we 're ever gonna meet . That is so depressing . What the hell ? JOE : Doing tests . Must be checking to see if water can come through . BEN : Doesn 't look good . We 're screwed . Wait . It 's like a sieve . - What the hell 's a sieve ? - A strainer , you douche , like for pasta . - So it does let water through ? - Yeah , just a little . Maybe we can get through . Aren 't we like 70 percent water ? Yeah , it 's the other 30 percent that 's the problem , genius . This , and can you give me a pack of filtered ? Actually , you know what ? Make it three . WOMAN : Anything else ? - No , that 's it . [ REGISTER BEEPING ] Thank you . Didn 't anyone ever tell you smoking is bad for you ? Hey , no , these aren 't for me . It 's an investment . We end up getting stuck in here for a while , you would be surprised what people will swap for these things . So I 'd probably hang on to that candy bar if I were you . [ SCOFFS ] JULIA : What 's wrong ? You had it working before . DODEE : Yeah , it 's not like punching in the presets on your car radio . - This takes finesse . - Finesse , my ass . She 's just diddling . Sometimes she gets lucky . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Further tests reveal the dome appears to be impervious to high-energy lasers . - How 's that for lucky ? - Shh . WOMAN : After exhaustive testing , we are unable to determine the origin - or the composition of the dome . - Oh , my God . - The military doesn 't know what it is . - So ? So it means they didn 't do it . They 're not responsible . Who is ? Empty . Oh , come on . Come on . JUNIOR : Hey . What have you got there ? - Why are you following me ? - So this is where you did it . I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . This is where you screwed her . I know all about you and Angie . - Who 's Angie ? - Don 't act like you don 't know . Looks like she put up a pretty good fight . She belongs to me . That 's too bad for her . JUNIOR : Argh ! She still belongs to me . - You just stay the hell away from me . - Or what ? Or next time I 'm not gonna stop . [ LAUGHS ] The Lord works in mysterious ways . [ LAUGHS ] Oh , God . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! No ! No ! [ BARKING ] Oh , man . His master must have been right there . Someone must have dragged the rest of the body away . - Poor fella . - The dog 's the poor fella ? I kind of feel sorrier for the cut-in-half dude . His name 's Truman . What are we gonna do with him ? Can 't just leave him here . Holy crap , look . - A fire . - Let 's go check it out . Come on , Truman . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] - You almost killed us . PAUL : I got something for you . - What are you thinking ? - This town is one click away from total , complete lawlessness . When the time comes , I 'm ready , and you should be too . - We 're all on the same side here . - Yeah , for now . [ GUN COCKS ] - Who the hell are you ? - Easy , that 's the guy that saved the McAlister kid when the plane crashed in the dome . JACKIE [ ON RADIO ] : Linda , you there ? - Get out here so I can see you . - Come here . - Go ahead , Jackie . Sarah Martin just drove over . She says there 's a fire at 223 Pretty Valley Road . Oh , my God . That 's Duke 's house . - Get every warm body out there to help . - Kiss it goodbye . The entire fire department is out there and we 're in here . Put that rifle down and get your ass to Duke 's . - You 're not my boss . - Now . You , warm body , get in . MAN [ ON RADIO ] : Any fire trucks still here ? LINDA : Rusty and his buddies took them all to Westlake for that damn parade . Clear the line and get to Duke 's . Damn it , Coggins . [ TIRES SCREECHING ] WOMAN : Where 's the fire department ? Stay back . Stay back . Stay back . LESTER : Help ! Help ! Somebody . Somebody help me ! [ POLICE SIREN WAILING ] MAN : Get out of the way . - What are you doing here ? - I heard it on the scanner . - What happened ? - I have no idea . - Just glad Duke lived alone . FREDDY : Come on , everyone . Please , stand back . Come on , keep a safe distance . - We have to put this out . - How the hell are we gonna do that ? You guys still got water pressure . So go and get as many garden hoses as you can . Go , go , go . PAUL : Guys , we need hoses . BARBIE : Who 's got a hose ? Right there . Grab your hose . [ PEOPLE CLAMORING ] JULIA : Excuse me . MAN 1 : Brian , your hose ! MAN 2 : Back up ! [ CAMERA CLICKING ] JULIA : Barbie . It hasn 't rained in weeks . We 're inside a damn tinderbox . If those flames spread to any of these other houses , it 's gonna take Chester 's Mill and us with it . Hey , everybody who does not have a garden hose , I want you to go get a bucket , a pot , a trash can , something . Anything that can hold water . - Let 's go . MAN 3 : Go , get buckets ! LESTER : Help ! Please , help me ! - Someone 's inside . Linda ! LESTER : Help ! Anybody in here ? [ COUGHING ] Hello ? FREDDY : Linda . - You okay ? LINDA : Yeah . FREDDY : What the hell was Coggins doing in Duke 's house ? - I don 't know . Where did Jim go ? - I don 't know . MAN 1 : Get out of here ! MAN 2 : Propane tank next to the house ! LINDA : Oh , my God . It 's a propane tank . PAUL : Go , go , get out of here . - Come on , get him out ! MAN 3 : Go , go ! The flames are too high . ROSE : The hoses aren 't cutting it . JULIA : The fire is spreading to the shrubs . MAN 1 : Get another hose over there . WOMAN : Not enough water pressure . Can you imagine our neighbors back in Brentwood helping out this way ? I don 't even know who our neighbors are . FREDDY : We gotta go faster . Vick , you holding up all right ? Come on . Right , just like that . We gotta get more water on this thing , all right ? Come on , keep going . Keep going , everyone . We gotta get more water . Come on . Faster , faster . JULIA : Keep at it , people . The fire is spreading to the fence . The house will be next . BARBIE : Deputy , give me a hand . Over there , the bottom of the tree , the bottom of the fence . Go get more buckets ! Get some buckets in here ! The car 's on fire . Guys , stop . Everybody back . - This isn 't gonna work . - Like playing Whac-A-Mole . As long as Duke 's house is burning , the fire is gonna keep jumping . Then it 's over . Maybe not . Hey , make some room ! Let 's go ! Clear the street ! Get out of the street ! Let 's go ! Hey , back up . Everybody get back . Everybody get back . Let 's go . What the hell is Big Jim doing ? Is he insane ? He 's gonna tear down Duke 's house . [ GRUNTING ] [ OUTER DOOR CLANKING ] [ DOOR CLANKING ] What the hell happened to you ? Took care of your boyfriend . - My boyfriend ? - The guy you 've been screwing . Killed him . No , you didn 't . He 's dead , Angie . He 's never gonna touch you ever . - I don 't believe you . - Why not ? I 've known you since the third grade , James . Even you couldn 't do something that terrible . That 's my Angie . I brought you something . This is what we 're working for . [ SIGHS ] Bucket brigade . Pretty clever . - You weren 't too shabby yourself . - Why , thank you . Dale . Dale Barbara ? I 'm guessing that 's you . - Guilty . - Where 'd you find them ? You know what ? They were actually just right there where I left them . Just hanging over the mirror in your bathroom . Huh . That was the first place I checked . I must have missed them . JIM : How 's he doing ? He 's lucky Linda got to him when she did . Took in a lot of smoke , but I think he 's gonna pull through . Do you mind if I have a moment with him ? What the hell were you thinking ? - You told me to clean up our mess . - You call this cleaning it up ? LINDA : How is he ? Well , someone up there watching over him . - Thank you for saving me . - You 're welcome . But what in the world were you doing in there ? I was , uh ... Getting a suit for Duke 's funeral . I switched on a light and then ... I can 't really remember the rest . Must have been a gas leak . The dome is right there in Duke 's backyard . Probably severed a line . We 're just all glad you 're okay , reverend . Bless you , child . [ LESTER COUGHS ] ROSE : Linda , thank you for saving the reverend . MAN 1 : That 's right . MAN 2 : Appreciate it . LINDA : I 'm just doing my job . Thank you , everyone , for a job well done . Well , we couldn 't have done it without you , Big Jim . [ APPLAUSE ] I appreciate that , but this isn 't about me . It 's about all of us . We stood together , shoulder to shoulder , like a town should in times like these . Now , this is not gonna be the last crisis that Chester 's Mill faces . But we 'll get through the next one with the same courage and solidarity that we showed today . Thank you all . PAUL : Like hell , we will . Go ahead . Pat yourselves on the backs all you want , but we 're toast . Great , you can put out a fire . So , what ? That thing , that thing is trapping smoke . - And there 's no way out . - Hey , come on , man . Take it easy , Paul . - Back up . JIM : Hey . Don 't you tell me to take it easy . You 're just like him . You 're lying to these people and promising that everything 's gonna be okay . And it 's not gonna be okay ! This thing is never gonna go away . - And we 're all gonna die ! LINDA : Paul , don 't . [ RICOCHET ] WOMAN : Oh , no . LINDA : Oh , no . No , Freddy , Freddy . MAN : He shot him . LINDA : Freddy , stay with me . Freddy . Breathe . Stay with me . Come on , stay with me , Freddy . [ CROWD MURMURING ] Freddy . Freddy . Freddy .

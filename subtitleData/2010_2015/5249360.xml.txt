 WOMAN : This is Cody 's special day , November 11th . BOY : Jump . Dad ! Dad ! FATHER : Well , there he is . Wait , is it your birthday today ? CODY : You got to make it ! You got to make it ! [ Father chuckles ] FATHER : I told you . I told you I would get it . Happy Birthday . [ Gun makes electronic sounds ] Next birthday we 'll have a whole team of guys here . We 'll all be playing baseball together . - Get set . - [ Gus barks ] Go ! FATHER : Argh ! FATHER : I pulled a muscle . Got to do- - - MOTHER : What- - - FATHER : What the hell was that ? - Cody ? - Cody ? Cody ? Cody ! No ! Nah , I don 't think Hoyt had anything to do with it . Uh , sad but true , kids are kidnapped . Well , right after it happened , 'cause , you know , they had to , like , drag him into court and all that stuff- - so he 's kind of forced to be around everybody and all that stuff- - there was a difference . And there was some mean in him then , you know . I didn 't consider him , up until that time , a drunkard or anything . I didn 't talk to him at length about it , but , you know , we were delivering hay , and he was just broke up . You know , show it to me and then I 'll believe it . You ask me , I think he 's- - he 's guilty . Maybe everybody 's projecting their fear on Hoyt . Maybe that 's what 's going on . That 's why he 's left alone . But he 's staying there until he finds his boy . I mean , it 's sad . It 's sad as can be . I 've got kids and grandkids . And if an 8-year-old grandkid of mine disappeared , I 'd be- - Yeah , I don 't know what I 'd do . Cody was in my little girl 's class . I 've been having to go in and sleep with her almost every night , you know , 'til she falls asleep . So , yeah , it 's been hard . Of course , I know Cody , man . He 's a good kid . Funny . Little wiry . He was gonna grow into them feet one day . Yeah , man . Yeah . I knew Cody . I mean , I 've followed it quite a bit . I don 't really buy either one . I 'm not into the paranormal stuff . I 've never seen that tape . And I 've never seen a wolf like that . Um ... But it could happen . Could happen around here if it 's going to happen somewhere . That 's- - I don 't believe any of it , you know . I got to see something to believe it . I 've never seen anything like that . You stick around , man , you 'll see something . [ Clears throat ] My name is Sam green . I 'm a ph.D. In socio-cultural anthropology from the university of Chicago . I 've been working for mde for about six months as a field scientist . - [ Vehicle approaches ] - Sorry . My man ! Hey , Sam ! How are you , buddy ? - Good to see you , man . - You , too . My name 's Cameron Murphy . Um ... I 'm an investigative journalist from Los Angeles . Sam and I grew up together . He called me about a month ago . Told me he was heading up an investigation to some strange cattle ranch . Asked me if I would come out and observe it from a third party perspective . Hey , this is our videographer britain . Hey , man . Cameron . Nice to meet you . My name 's britain Sloan . I 'm a freelance cameraman . Normally don 't like to be in front of the camera . So I 'll make this short . I 've done this kind of work before with other groups . And we 've never come across anything strange or out of the ordinary . So I hope this trip is a little different . Hey , man , would you grab his bag for him ? Yeah . - Thanks , man . - How about a little tour of the grounds ? - Yeah . - All right . Hoyt ! I want you to meet my friend Cameron Murphy . - Hey , Cameron . - Hoyt , pleasure . Hoyt Miller . That 's my name . Hoyt Miller . And , uh , I bought this , uh ... This ranch , oh , four years- - little over four years ago- - with the idea of turning it into something , you know , special or ... say , uh ... Do I have to do this ? Can I- - do I have to talk to the camera right now ? I don 't really feel like it . - Nice to meet you . - All right , you guys be up in about 45 minutes . We 'll have the atv ready . - Sounds good . - Come on , girl . This is our main vet tech Lisa . Lisa , Cameron . Oh , Cameron , I heard a lot about you . My name is Lisa Moreau . I 'm the field veterinary tech . I 've worked locally for years . I just started working with mde a couple months ago . This is my first big case with them . They brought me on because I 'm so familiar with the cattle mutilations in the area . It 's disturbing . I 've seen a lot of sick and dead animals in my line of work . But ... The cattle mutilation phenomenon is ... I don 't have an explanation for it . Is the horse still acting unusual ? Uh , no . The horse 's moods have stabilized . Their behavior 's been completely erratic . So , it 's fine now . But talk to me in 10 minutes . - All right , I will . - Ok . Uh , you seen Matt ? Yeah , I think ray has him setting up something behind the house . - Lisa , pleasure . - Nice to meet you . That 's a long time to be in Afghanistan , man . Actually , I was embedded with a group of about 10 soldiers for a period of nearly three months . - How 's it going ? - You mean , motion sensor hell ? Hi , I 'm Matt Johnson . And I work in the media lab at mde , which is how I met Sam , who brought me onboard the project . We both share a passion for the paranormal . And , uh , well , I really hope that this project helps legitimize the field a little bit . Also I 'm here as the team 's driver , cook , and resident bitch . You ready ? [ Walkie-talkie beeps ] MAN : Copy . [ Walkie-talkie beeps ] MAN : What was that ? My hand , over . MAN : Walk in front of it , you stupid ass . That 's ray . Let 's go meet him . Ray , I want you to meet Cameron Murphy . Hey , man . You here to help with the sensors , man ? Ray Reed . Ex-military . Here for the security and wires and shit . If lady luck shines upon us , this place is gonna be a God damn fortress . That 's all I got . We done ? Hmm . SAM : How are the cameras coming ? They 're almost set up . When you guys are done , why don 't you pop on by and I 'll show you . LISA : Afternoon , Hoyt . HOYT : Ready to roll ? MAN : Let 's go . [ Engine starts ] All right . Everybody in ? CAMERON : Where we headed ? LISA : Hoyt found a dead deer on the property . Sam wants to check it out . What 's the acreage ? About 1,000 give or take . SAM : Well , it 's not clearly defined . But parts of Southern Idaho , the uintah basin , four corners , all the way to Nevada and California is considered the paranormal mecca of the United States . Local tribes won 't even set foot on this land to this day . There 's evidence for this ? We got , uh , evidence going back to the 1800s with the first documented ufo sightings . Roswell crash in ' 47 . First reported cattle mutilation in ' 67 . Dugway is basically the new area 51 . Never heard of it . You passed it right on the way up here . Ground zero for U.S. military research . I mean , we 're talking everything from remote viewing to psychological warfare . HOYT : Just over the Ridge here . [ Engine stops ] Sam , I 'm sorry to burst your bubble . But she died of natural causes . Do you see the discoloration in the tongue ? It 's a classic case of hemorrhagic disease . SAM : Take a sample anyway . Sure , whatever you want . Hey , uh ... We 'd better get back . We got a big storm coming . SAM : Thanks , Hoyt . All right . All the feeds record directly into the server here . Just in case , I got it all backed up on the C-70 . It 's generator powered . It 's all independently wired , and it 's set to record 24 / 7 . Camera one 's a wide shot of the road so we can monitor everyone coming in and out of the property . Camera two is wide of the house . Camera three is of the Western pasture . Camera four is of the corral . Camera five is the barn exterior . And camera six is inside the barn . That 's it for the exterior cameras . CAMERON : What happens at night ? They all switch to infrared . MATT : This is the X-ray I was talking about . RAY : Not really my thing . LISA : Oh , let me see it . MATT : Well , just pass it along . Thanks . If I could , I 'd like to propose a toast . Uh , I just want to , um ... Thank you all for coming up here . Uh ... Since my boy 's been gone , the help 's been few and far between . And I just- - I really appreciate it . And I want you to know that whatever this thing is , I believe it 's still here . And it 's really smart . As a matter of fact , I would bet my arm that it 's watching us right now . So ... Oh , no . Don 't leave me up here . Cheers . - MATT : Cheers . - LISA : Cheers . Matt [ Over walkie-talkie ] : Where do you want me to go ? RAY : Just walk and I 'll find you . MATT : Copy . RAY : This is the living room ? HOYT : Yes . Say hi to big brother . Say it . Hi . RAY : Bedroom one . Bedroom two . The dining room . Kitchen . Hey , Matt , can you go downstairs for me , please ? Matt [ Over walkie-talkie ] : You got it . RAY : Hoyt 's room . Cody 's room . Got the basement . And this is the old butcher room . Oh , my God ! I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean- - just the cameras . And I thought you knew I was here . It 's all right . Just don 't sneak up on people like that . I know . It was stupid . I 'm sorry . - All right . - This works . God damn it , ray . The blind spot 's going to be on you , man . If you guys need to review any footage , just let me know . And I 'll set it up right here . I got motion detectors across most of the property . So if something moves , we 're going to know about it . Also I programmed most of the sensors to detect only large objects . I don 't want the local wildlife having us chase ghosts all night . All right . [ Clears throat ] August 2nd . It 's my first official night here at the ranch . [ Knocking at door ] - LISA : Hey . - Hi . Are you in here talking to yourself ? Um , no . Actually it 's the camera . I use it as a video journal . Oh . What happened to the days of the mighty pen and paper ? Is that still a thing , or ... Sadly , they are gone . Hmm . Well , as long as you don 't use this thing for any midnight photography ... Scout 's honor . LISA : Oh , good . - I got that on tape . - You did . - And tape . - Right . CAMERON : So how long have you known Sam ? LISA : A couple months . Listen , uh , I actually would prefer this to be off . CAMERON : It 's actually this button . LISA : Well , that is good to know . [ High-pitched sound ] [ Men screaming ] [ Muffled screaming ] [ Screaming , high-pitched sound stops ] MAN : What the hell was that ? [ Rattling on roof ] HOYT : They 're on the roof ! Shh . What the hell is it ? Is that the- - CAMERON : Shh . MAN : Shit . [ Rattling continues ] MATT : Oh , my God . You guys . You guys ! I 'll get the ladder . Careful going up , britain . MATT : Wait , Lisa , what- - LISA : Matt , don 't . Rabies . RAY : You ever seen anything like that before , Hoyt ? Hell no . Nothing like this . There 's no trauma . The internal organs are fine . It was definitely the tone that messed with their sonar . Uh-huh . This is just the beginning . [ Slow country music plays ] CAMERON : I 'm gonna get some sleep . Good luck with that . MATT : I 'm going to document it as the tone . Yeah , absolutely . I need you to check more . MATT : We 've already checked- - [ phone rings ] [ Ring ] MACHINE : Hello . Please leave a message after the tone . [ Beep ] Hello , Mr. Miller , this is Dr. David at white oak psychiatric . I wanted to talk to you about your wife 's progress over the last month . If you could give me a call at your earliest convenience , I 'd appreciate it . [ Click , beep ] MATT : Oh , my God . Sorry . LISA : Ok . It 's ok . - SAM : You guys all right ? - MATT : Yeah . SAM : Good . ' Cause I 'm going to need you to follow me out to the pasture . What 's going on ? RAY : Mde never mentioned anyone else coming up to the property . I don 't think that 's them . He 's been sitting out there about 35 , 45 minutes . There 's no plates on it . MATT : Is that thing military ? RAY : I don 't know . It 's hard to tell . LISA : Well , maybe it 's someone who got lost . MATT : He 's on the move . He 's turning around . Sam , wait . Hang on . I have a question . What do you think , ray ? I don 't know . But it 's not right . No . It sure ain 't right . I 've never seen anybody out there like that . No way . [ Crosstalk in background ] SAM : Look , I 'm team leader of this thing . HOYT : If you are the team leader , then you 're supposed to know- - look , Hoyt , I don 't know every vehicle that 's going to come on to the ranch . RAY : Hey , calm down . Listen , figure it out . Ok , so I ran an analysis on that tone from last night . Turns out there were actually two sounds on that tape . There was that high-pitched noise that we obviously know , the one that woke us up . But below that I found traces of infrasound . LISA : Infrasound ? Yeah , it 's a frequency below the audible range of the human ear . So what could cause something like that ? I mean , infrasound can occur naturally or it can be manmade . You know , at certain cycles per second , the military has actually successfully tested infrasound to cause things like vertigo , depression , fear , anxiety , physical lesions , throat pressure , all sorts of awful side effects . And , I mean , those are just the ones that we know about . Ok . And how about naturally ? All the big natural disasters that we know of- - volcanoes , earthquakes , avalanches . It 's why animals are able to detect earthquakes before people do . They pick up the vibrations . Animals- - whales- - they use inaudible sounds to paralyze and catch certain prey , like , you know , fish . I 'm just saying that the sound we heard that Matt 's talking about could 've been caused by a live animal . We have no idea what we 're dealing with here . RAY : How the fuck would a whale get up here ? So what are we doing out here ? Oh , it 's really well documented that attempting to communicate with paranormal energies directly really increases likelihood of contact . Follow me . After you . Sam has asked me to come and do a blessing on the property to communicate with the energy that speaks from this earth . But you need to know . This land is forsaken by my people . And it 's only to try and bring you some protection that I 've agreed to come . There are legends of warriors hunting in this valley , returning to their tribe disturbed and changed . Stories of whole tribes disappearing . There is a darkness in this soil . I would not feel right if I didn 't suggest that you leave now or to say that this place has nothing for you but suffering . I also know that you 've chosen to stay . And I 'll do what I can to bring some light here , no matter how small . I ask for silence now while I reach out to my ancestors . [ Speaks native language ] [ Sings in native language ] Ahh . Ahh . Are you ok ? Can you breathe ? Sam . There 's nothing I can do for you . You need to get the fuck out of here . Uh , 1 : 00 A.M. on the 4th . Um , already low on sleep after the events of the other night . Sam seems to think we 're close to getting something concrete , some- - some kind of evidence . I admit the sound , the dead bats- - strange , certainly . Paranormal ? I 'm not so sure . [ Knocking at door ] Hang on . So what 's up ? Ray 's got something . Come on . So what do we got ? Just a second ago , something very large set off one of the sensors in the blind spot . Zone three , specifically . So we 're talking about something bigger than a deer . Try the size of a God damn helicopter . SAM : All right . Cameron , check the far side of the field . The rest of you guys , come with me . [ Thunder ] [ Thunder ] CAMERON : Over here ! This is not a natural death . What about an animal attack ? Oh , no . There are no bite marks , no claw marks . These incisions , they 're perfect . Sorry , girl . No blood . It 's almost surgical . Shit . All right , I want to bag the whole thing . Matt , get the bag . [ High-pitched squeal in distance ] What is it ? Come on , Sam , if you 're going to do it , do it quick . [ Wind chimes clinking ] [ Whispering ] Hi , Lisa . Hey , Sam . Hey , britain . BRITAIN : Hey . Blood ? Oh , yeah . I had a nosebleed last night . You prone to nose bleeds ? Uh , no . And I 've had a couple since I 've been here . I 'm thinking it 's just the elevation or ... SAM : Maybe . [ Sets plate down ] Come on , britain . RAY : And you knew to check the tape because she had a few bloody noses ? SAM : Just a hunch . I don 't think we can tell him . Tell him what ? How would you even explain this ? You don 't . You want to see something even crazier ? This is a tape from the 9th . August 8th . CAMERON : Oh , my God . RAY : August 7th . 11 : 11 every night . SAM : Ray , what time is it ? It 's 11 : 09 . SAM : What time is it , Matt ? MATT : It 's almost 10 after . Ray , check the camera . LISA : You guys , what 's going on ? MATT : What are you guys doing ? Sam , what 's going on ? Matt , I need you to give me an exact count up to 11 : 11 . - SAM : You understand ? - RAY : All right , camera 's good . - LISA : Why ? - RAY : Camera 's good . - Where are we at right now ? - You 're at a minute right now . - What are you guys doing ? - Can you come outside for just a second ? Sure . Sure . Yeah . Wait a minute . What are you guys doing ? Wait a second ! This is my house . What are you guys doing ? All right , look , the last couple of nights at exactly 11 : 11 , energy has moved through the house . MATT : Sam , you 're at 45 seconds . - HOYT : An energy in this house ? - SAM : Yeah . What do you mean " an energy " ? What are you talking about ? [ Pumps shotgun ] - No , we don 't need- - - You don 't need the gun ! [ Crosstalk ] Where we at ? 30 seconds ? All right , no matter what you see , no matter what you guys see , the camera goes first . HOYT : I 'm putting it down . Okay . MATT : Ok , we 're at 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 11 : 11 . Nothing . [ Ghostly whoosh ] Cody ! Cody ! Cody ! Cody ! Hey , Cody ! Cody ! Cody , buddy , it 's daddy . CAMERON : Sam , get back . Cody ! Cody . Cody ! Cody ? Matt , Lisa . Get in here . What the hell is this ? Matt , you go get her kit . We need to cast all these prints . Look at all these tracks . Where did they come from ? These are definitely canine prints . But they 're enormous . Anything ? Nothing yet . How 's Hoyt ? CAMERON : For better or worse , he 's got a lot of alcohol in him now . But it seems like he 's calmed down . You guys , I got something . Unh . It says " for emergencies only . " RAY : What the hell is that , Sam ? Make a call right now . Sam ! No one 's picking up . Do you have another number for them ? No . - Sam , someone 's- - - What do you want me to do , Lisa ? - I 'm just saying- - - [ Phone rings ] Yeah . I did call , yes . Well , what we have- - you 're saying they were here ? - From ' 67 to ' 71 . - Doing what ? Look , you guys are looking at this the wrong way , ok ? They answered all my questions . They offered to provide documentation . They 're not trying to hide anything . They did ? They answered your question- - your questions ? What the hell are you talking about ? They answered all my questions , Hoyt . My goodness gracious , they did ? They didn 't find anything , ok ? I want to talk to you for a second . They were here . They were here . - MATT : Wait . Wait . - HOYT : Just listen to me one second ! - HOYT : Listen to me ! - CAMERON : Matt ! They were here ? You 're telling me they were here . They were here before my boy was taken . MATT : ... Better science . HOYT : You 're just talking . You 're just talking . You 're not saying anything . You just say , " blah , blah , blah . " That 's the way you live your life . You just talk . I 'm talking about something real here . I 'm talking about my boy . Look , we had no idea until I just had that phone call . But them being here has nothing to do with your boy . You understand , Hoyt ? Why ? Why does it have nothing to do with my boy ? Tell me . Do- - do you have an answer ? Excuse me . MATT : Lisa , you are a scientist . What are you investigating ? What are you trying to find ? Are you trying to find my boy ? Are you trying to find my son ? Just look me in the eye and tell me that you 're trying to find my son . Are you trying to find my son ? - I 'm trying to help you . - How you trying to help me ? You 're trying to help yourself . I 'm on to you . You 'd better watch out . You 'd better watch yourself . Put it down . This is what I was telling you about . Guys , I found two more containers buried in the shed . Now , one was empty like the first one I found . But the second had this in it . - What is this ? - It 's a u-matic tape . Mostly used in the late ' 60s and early ' 70s . And , Sam , that would correspond to the timeframe that mde said they were originally on the property . I 'm not sure offhand if we have anything on site I can check this with . I 'll see what I can put together , all right ? [ Exhales ] Late night . August 12th . Apparently mde was out here in the ' 60s looking into this thing . The box we found in the shed said " for emergencies only . " And it was empty . I would , uh , probably be more concerned about that if I hadn 't seen what looked like Hoyt 's son tear through the house , go into a shed , and completely disappear . He was gone . I- - I can 't explain it . I feel like Sam is so obsessed with finding evidence about what 's happening here that he won 't even question mde 's motives . - [ Roar ] - Aah ! CAMERON : So , Lisa , you 've never seen anything like this ? LISA : No . That 's it , then . Let 's go hunting . SAM : There should be tracks , right ? LISA : I think we should be looking for the tracks we found in the shed . It has to be the same animal . And just judging by the size of the wolf we saw , I 'd say it was easily 500 pounds , which is five times larger- - MATT : Guys ! That thing is huge . [ Shotgun pumps ] [ Growling ] Come on , let 's go get it . Come on , that 's what we 're here for . Go ! [ Engine starts ] HOYT : We got to go the rest of the way on foot , he 's right out there . CAMERON : All right , let 's go . HOYT : Easy now . Easy now . [ Growling ] CAMERON : Look at that . LISA : I want to go back now . [ Growling ] - Ok . - [ Shotgun fires ] CAMERON : Easy . Wait . Slow down . I 'll be right there . Careful ! Careful ! Hoyt , where 'd it go ? I don 't see it . Be careful . Guys , over here ! MATT : Wait , Sam , did you see the light ? - LISA : What is it ? - MATT : There was a light . MATT : I bet it 's a cave system . I got some ropes in my truck . Let me go get ' em . - MATT : All right . - HOYT : You guys be careful . That thing 's still out here somewhere . Sam , you 're gonna want to see this . CAMERON : How old do you think that is ? Jesus , Sam , what 's going on really ? HOYT : What the hell we even looking at ? Ray , look at this ! Looks like we found our artist . Shh . Shh . How the hell would that thing even get down here ? [ Growling ] Oh , God ! Go ! Come on ! [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshots ] Matt ! Come on ! Come on ! I said hurry ! Let 's go ! Matt , the rope ! CAMERON : Britain first ! Come on , turn off the camera . August 13th . We just ... [ Garbled ] ... the wolf , I don 't know ... [ Garbled ] Could be a vimana , right ? RAY : A what ? A vimana . Huh ? In India , they 've uncovered all these ancient texts and documents that describe a flying spacecraft called a vimana . And I mean , it looks- - it looks just like this . Even though that stuff is , like , 6,000 years old and a lot of people think it 's myth , experts in our field think that , you know , based on the schematics and the flight plans and the design that it 's as modern as anything you 'd see today . Are you suggesting that our native painted a spacecraft on the inside of this cave ? Yeah . Just , I know everything we 've seen . That just seems pretty astounding . - Well , it 's , like , a perfect match . - And the wolf ? This is bigger than a wolf or missing kid . How do you even know he 's back here ? He 's working on the atv . Just wanted to say I completely lost my perspective back there . And , uh ... I 'm really sorry . Stuff like that happens sometimes , you know . You know , uh ... Cody , on his birthday , he woke his mother up with a handful of wildflowers he picked in that field right out there . And she looked at him , and she said , " son , what- - it 's your birthday . Why- - why you giving me flowers ? " And he said , " well , because you 're the reason I got born , ma . " That 's the kind of kid he was . He is . That 's Cody . Listen , um , I 'm sorry I gave you a hard time the other night at the table . It 's just ... I don 't ... I don 't understand your techniques . And , uh ... I just want you to know I appreciate you 're here . And , um , I mean , it 's the only thing that gives me any hope . [ Whirring ] [ Whoosh ] Nothing . [ Distorted music plays ] HOYT : That doesn 't make sense at all . [ Rustling ] CAMERON : Shh ! [ Metal clanking ] - [ Owl screeches ] - Aah ! [ Dog barks ] [ Barking ] [ Barking continues ] [ Yelps ] SAM : What 's the problem ? The pasture cam 's down . Matt , take this walkie and go out there . Won 't even take you two minutes , man . - All right , Sam , can you- - - Just do it , Matt ! [ Door closes ] SAM : Take me through all the exterior cams . All right . - [ Walkie-talkie beeps ] - Do you copy ? RAY : Give me 30 feet back for focus . Thanks , buddy . Matt ? Matt ! LISA : Aah ! Oh , my God ! RAY : Go ! Matt 's up and about . He 's pretty beat up , but he should be fine . I have no explanation for what happened to Hoyt 's dog . Cameron , did you hear me ? Yeah , I 'm ... Sorry . MATT : Seriously , Sam , just back off . I mean it ! Why are you doing this ? What the hell is wrong with you ? I was just picked up and thrown . And we don 't have a single explanation as to how that 's even possible ! Look , let me tell you what 's going down . I 'm going to the E.R. then I 'm booking a flight out of here . And if you guys had , like , an ounce of common sense , you 'd all come with me ! You need another driver so bad , you hire someone else . [ Engine starts ] Be careful , guys . Seriously . You 're an asshole , Sam ! You know that ? Asshole ! We still have Hoyt 's truck . We can go in Hoyt 's truck . So what 's going on , ray ? Are you guys aware that Matt found additional mde materials in the shed , including a videotape ? Yeah , he mentioned it . But I thought it was too old to play up here . No . It turns out I was able to find an old deck and transfer it to a hard drive . Ok . So what was on the tape ? I think it 's better if I just play it for you guys . MAN : There . Right there . Rebecca , can you hear me ? [ Radio chatter ] We 're on our way back in with Rebecca . About eight minutes out . Mommy ? Mommy ? Where 's mommy ? MAN : That 's what we 're trying to figure out , Rebecca . You remember the last time you were with her ? [ Whirring ] WOMAN : How far out was she ? MAN : Well beyond the pasture . WOMAN : And the dog ? MAN : No . MAN : What 's she doing ? Michelle ! [ Breathing heavily ] Ahh . Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! [ Breathing heavily ] [ Roar ] Ray played us the tape that Matt had found in the shed . There 's something unexplainable out here . If that tape is to be believed , then I just witnessed the killing of an entire team of people by something completely unknown . Why would they send us out here ? Sam is so obsessed with what 's happening , we 're hesitant to even show him the tape . And Hoyt ... [ Garbled ] I think we should go . We have to go . But I do not think that he is in a place to make decisions right now . What the hell are we supposed to do then ? I say we leave tonight . We have Hoyt 's truck . [ Growling ] Get behind me . Get in the truck . Get in the fuckin ' truck ! Go ! Get in the truck ! Hey ! Where is it ? Lisa ! [ Roar , growling ] [ Lisa and Cameron screaming ] CAMERON : Shit ! [ Growling continues ] What the fuck is it doing ? Ah , shit ! Where did- - where did it go ? He just ran off . Are you ok , Lisa ? Are you ok ? Aah . Lisa , no ! No ! What are you doing ? Stop it ! Lisa , stop ! I don 't remember anything . Nothing . We should 've left with Matt . We 're getting unprecedented footage , guys . This is what we wanted . This is why we came here . This is what we wanted ? People are getting hurt . What are you talking about , Sam ? Look , I think the thing is a single intelligence . Oh , for- - you know something ? You 're out of your mind . Look , we are so close . We are right there . Close to what ? What if this thing can turn into an orb or a wolf or even Cody ? Or me ? Sam , seriously , it 's fuckin ' done . I don 't want to be here anymore , Sam . I can 't be here anymore . Go pack your bag . I 'll meet you at the front door in five minutes . Ok , we are leaving . You 're not going anywhere . Cameron , please ! Get your hands off me . It 's done , Sam ! - Well , I 'm not leaving ! - It 's over ! Stop ! Cody . Cody ! I got your bag , britain . I 'm ready . We ready ? What about Sam ? He won 't listen . We 'll send somebody back . Who gives a shit about Sam ? LISA : Ray ? [ Crash ] What the fuck is this , Cameron ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God ! Come on . Come on . Let 's go , Lisa ! Go ! They 're sending a van first thing in the morning . In the morning ? That 's the soonest they can get here , Lisa . That- - that 's great , Sam , considering we were just out in Hoyt 's driveway and his truck was completely disassembled and we didn 't hear a God damn thing . - Leave anytime you want . - How ?

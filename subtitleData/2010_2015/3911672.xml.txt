 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... I have a special ... order . You have a date ? Be yourself . - So what high school did you go to ? - Why all the questions about my past ? What am I doing here ? I got ... What kind of advice is " be yourself " ? Because myself is a giant freakazoid . When you said " meet me at the diner " , I thought you 'd arranged some lame meet with me and Todd . - Get out . - Yeah , leaving . - My lips can 't focus . I 'm too excited . - Me too . I know . The warehouse is finally getting a computer upgrade . Right . The IRS warehouse where you work . - Exciting . Very exciting . - I know , right ? That place has been running on a first-gen 8-bit GUI since , like , the stone ages . I 'm so sorry . I keep forgetting you 're not a high-tech kind of guy . I 'm pumped if you 're pumped . But my computer skills go as far as getting new ring tones for my phone . You 're cute for a luddite . Oh , yikes . I 'm late . Got this guy coming to install the new system . Some mucky-muck from some place called Global Dynamics . - Catch up later ? - I could bring lunch . Crustless PBJ , Twinkies , and Doritos ? And an orange for fiber . That 's why I loves me some Todd . What are you do ... What are you doing ? Do you have any idea what you 're doing ? I was asked to upgrade this place to class seven standards and I can 't do that with you constantly interrupting me . Adapt . This is not Eureka . I will not have you gutting my system . Your guts are rotted . All right , every single wire has to go exactly back where it was . Half of these aren 't even wires . This one looks like shoelace . - Let me be clear . - There 's no metal . Just ask the lady that asked me to come , and ask her what she want ... If you damage any of my data , you will not come within an inch , of a computer for the rest of your life . Why don 't we let our special guest , who I bet Mrs. Frederic wouldn 't have sent here if he was trouble , do his thing , huh ? Come on , buddy . He 's a Global Dynamic geek . He 's soulless . He 's made up of binary numbers . I 'll tear his heart out . Wire in the hole . I drop stuff down there all the time . Hold on to me , will you ? I 'm Claudia , resident tech girl . Douglas . Douglas Fargo . Everyone just calls me Fargo . Neat gizmo , huh ? What makes it glow ? Is it , like , a phosphorous compound ? No , it belonged to Ben Franklin . Amplifies human energy to ... - First time in the warehouse ? - Until the scary lady showed up , I kind of thought Warehouse 13 was just an internet rumor . Any chance after I 'm done with the install , I could get a tour ? No can do , outlander . You 've only got blue level clearance . I have to ask . Is this ... GASP . Better than GASP . This is gonna replace all of that . It 's from Global Dynamics , where I work . Well , run , I guess . Yeah , I 'm in charge . And this thing ? It 's a M.A.R.A. A Maintenance And Repair Automaton . It 's for use in unmanned space stations , large facilities . I invented it . I was gonna install it with your system , but your boss vetoed it . Artie would have vetoed fire if he 'd been born just years earlier . So you ready to fire up Warehouse 13.1 or what ? Let 's get this over with . Shutting down the old systems now . And bring in the new . Anybody gonna ask me to dance ? What exactly did you do ? The new O.S. should have come right on . Really ? I hope that means we can 't park here . Catastrophic failure detected . " Catastrophic " is a bad word . Warehouse 13 - 2x05 13.1 Arrow , nitrogenc Salomon Those eyes are popping up all over the warehouse . - Is this thing looking at me ? - And what are they doing ? - I think they 're watching us . - This is all your fault , Bismarck . And it is not my fault . When we shut down the old system , some sort of fail-safe activated . I 'm completely locked out . - You didn 't say there was a fail-safe ? - I didn 't know there was a fail-safe . And aren 't so-called computer experts supposed to realize that before you shut down a system ? Boys , take it outside . Let me work a little Claudiosity . - I never should have let you in here . - It wasn 't exactly your decision now . No , you didn 't . It 's not coming from this office . All systems functioning within acceptable parameters . That voice . I recognize that voice . - That 's Hugo Miller 's voice . - Who ? He was the original designer of the Warehouse systems . Where are you going ? The computer lab . You have a computer lab ? More like a computer morgue . You didn 't think to mention there was a computer lab ? Well , later on , I 'll make a list for you of all the things that I didn 't think to mention . Has this been running the entire time ? No , of course not . Place has been shut down for 35 years . So why is it ... You know what ? Spread out , don 't touch anything , but look for an off switch . Who was Hugo Miller ? Brilliant man and more than a little devious . He actually encouraged Bill Gates to go in one direction while pushing Steve Jobs to go in another . Hugo spent years down here integrating the whole warehouse into a workable platform . Looks like he spent a lot of time playing with himself too . No way ! Awesome . Lemon Launch . Pete , that 's been here for years . If I were you , i 'd put that down . Hugo was a huge practical joker . He 'd leave exploding cans of pop everywhere . Used to drive everybody nuts . - What happened to him ? - He retired . Hello , blinky . That 's the fail-safe . There must be a main power junction . - You all right ? - I 've been hit with worse . Are you sure ? This thing is tied in to the fail-safe . Take a gander . It 's uploading a massive amount of data from our mainframe . Whatever it is , I think it 's moving in . This fail-safe is hardwired into the whole system , into the temperature regulators , the security feeds , into the neutralizer pump . Maybe that 's okay . We were installing a new computer anyway . One we can control . Why don 't we just bring Hugo Miller here ? I told you he 's retired . Retired or ... No , he 's alive . Don 't be dramatic . There were rumors about a nervous breakdown , but ... Sitting in a windowless room for ten years playing Monopoly with Hal ? - What could go wrong ? - Do we know where he retired to ? Place called Hutchinson . It 's in Featherhead . That 's two hours away . We should at least go talk to him . Try . I think I could " retire " here . Let 's check you in then . Hugo doesn 't get many visitors . Just give me a moment . I wonder if they give sponge baths here . Do you know every former warehouse agent we 've ever known is either crazy , evil , or dead ? Or all three . You can come in now . Mr. Miller , we 're from the ... I know who you are . You 're president Ulysses S. Grant and the snowman . You 've come because it 's Arbor Day and there aren 't enough zippers to go around . At least he 's not evil or dead . Yet . We have some questions about something you built years ago . A backup computer system ? It went round and round and spinning and spinning and dancing and flying . This is not gonna be a standard interview . No , it 's not . The koala bear is actually a marsupial . " All systems functioning within acceptable parameters . " Recovery fail-safe is active . Exactly . Exactly . The fail-safe . How do we shut it off ? You don 't have the code . Agent Miller , president Grant is ordering you to give us the code . Of course , Mr. President . But I must be paid in bicycles . Can do . I 'm not paying a bicycle for that . You know , maybe we should just take him back to the warehouse . Warehouse 13 ? You remember Warehouse 13 ? The spinning and the dancing ... And the boxes . If he sees the warehouse , he may remember the code . What do you think about that , buddy , huh ? Can we get ice cream ? - If that 's what you want . - Ice cream . - We got everything on Hugo Miller . - Excellent . Is it hard to find ? - Yes and no . - Perfect . All we have to do is go through and follow ... Redacted . - Who would do that ? - The regents . Crossing things out . Wait . They found Hugo collapsed on aisle Allentown-22c . Cited it as mental exhaustion . It 's finishing . Please don 't blow up . That wasn 't so bad . We 're still locked out . Is that ... It 's agent Miller . Agent Nielsen , I am Hugo One . I assume control in the event of catastrophic failure . Holographic artificial intelligence . Must be one of the earliest models ever . That would explain the Tom Selleck mustache . We were just installing a new system . There is no catastrophic failure . I will be the judge of that . The judge ? My eyes are currently scanning the warehouse for irregularities . I must also review decades of artifact retrieval and personnel files . Excuse me . At least he is polite . Artie , look , we found Miller , but he 's a complete nutjob . He kept talking about spinning and dancing and ... He tesla 'd us , Artie . His program is some kind of artificial intelligence . Bring him back here so he can turn this thing off . He kind of slipped away from us , so we 'll call you back when we get him . This is very unusual . He 's normally quite docile . We 've checked . He 's not on hospital grounds . Here are his records you asked for . You know , Myka ? This guy couldn 't have spun or danced far . Spinning and dancing , right ? On the way here we saw a ... I think I might know where he is . What ? What ? What ? What did we solve ? Hugo , are you okay ? So sad . It worked last time . Hey , buddy . I 'm gonna put these bright , shiny bracelets on you , okay ? And you can tell us all about it on the way to the warehouse . Come on up . Let 's do this one first . Hugo , we really need your help . Can 't help without the spinning . So why would he model Hugo One after himself ? Lots of programmers do that . I mean , I never have . Some others do . But this is impossible . When this was developed , A.I. was just science fiction . If something seems impossible , it usually means there 's an artifact involved . He 's coming back . I have completed my analysis . And everything 's cool , right ? So you can skedaddle . Claudia Donovan , your file shows nine separate incident reports . - Actually thought it would be more . - I guess he 's got your number . Douglas Fargo , your Global Dynamics profile includes the phrase " inappropriately pushed button " 38 times . Wait , wait , wait . You can access my G.D. file ? He 's accessing the warehouse system . If I can view an ATM in Sweden , for example , then so can Hugo One . Agent Nielsen , your unconventional management skills are subpar . - I 've had about enough of you . - I have determined the source of the recent catastrophic event . - Which is ? - The agents who work here . I have completed my analysis . Where are you ? The doritos are getting cold . Shoot . I 'm sorry . Got a bit of an emergency here . - I am gonna have to reschedule lunch . - No problem . - Maybe dinner ? - God , I hope so . - Who 's that ? - Nobody . I 'm nobody ? No , you 're Todd . This is Todd . I can 't talk right now . - Who is that ? - Nobody . I 'm nobody ? I can ... I can 't do this . I 'm gonna have to call you ... External communications are for warehouse business use only . Maybe a bad idea anyway . - So who 's Todd ? - A guy . A friend . A guy friend . It 's not serious . - Why ? - Yeah , no particular reason . I just kind of got the impression ... Just call her when your voice has changed , will you ? Work to do . Hugo One , I think that your calculations are incorrect . The agents are not the problem here . Falcon Scott protocol initiated . Please . You can 't be serious . Protecting the warehouse is my primary function . What 's Falcon Scott protocol ? The system initiates a temperature drop to sub-zero to protect the artifacts . And what happens to us ? That was fast . Round and round the mulberry bush the monkey chased the weasel Anything useful in that file about our Lawrence Welk back there ? It 's weird . There 's a recent neuro-imaging of his brain , it shows that there 's a whole section of it that 's completely dormant and there 's no explanation why . I need to shed a tear . Don 't we all ? He means he needs to go to the bathroom . - My uncle used to say that . - Hugo , okay , you hold it , okay ? I just got this baby detailed . There 's a gas station down the road . It 's cold . You think by saying that every 3 min it 's gonna get any warmer ? Got about an hour left before it becomes life-threatening . And where are you taking us ? We got to figure ... I didn 't catch that . What the hell ... - You took off his cuffs ? - He likes to sit . - That 's not in my job description . - Ice cream . Not now , Hugo . It 's like in the bathroom . Fine . You know what ? Grab me some Twizzlers . I 'm gonna call Artie and see what 's up . Artie , I can 't understand you . Albert grows things . Yeah , he 's had a long day . Just keep the change and thank you . Artie , slow down . There 's a new one . I think the Farnsworth is broken . Babble , babble , babble . I don 't know if you can hear me , but I read through Hugo 's medical file and half of his brain is burnt out . " Bring Hugo back . Computer has taken over . " What ? We have to get back there now . All right , buddy , we 're going for a ride . Be on the lookout for two kidnapping suspects . If you see these two people , you need to contact the police immediately . Suspects are wanted in connection ... Gonna have a little chat with Hugo One . Lattimer and Bering ? That 's what I thought . Hands above your heads . - Hey , pal , you 're making a mistake . - Don 't push me , cowboy ! Or we could just raise up our hands . Don 't you have any artifacts that make it warmer ? Increases elasticity , makes pigeons dance . Nothing here . I don 't get it . How is any of this dangerous ? Trust me , if it 's been snagged , bagged , and tagged , it 's got an evil streak . Todd , is he your boyfriend ? Guy friend . Okay , boyfriend . He 's nice . What about you ? Girlfriend ? Used to . She ... doesn 't exist anymore . When you break up , you really break up . I 'm new to the whole dating meme . I like Todd , but he thinks I work in a tax warehouse , so it 's not like I can say , " Hey , sorry I can 't make our date . " An evil computer took over my workplace . " Be nice if I could just have someone I could be honest with like you . Nice . A zoetrope . I used to have one when I was a kid . That one probably makes you ... Fargo , no ! I just saw your whole life flash before my eyes . And ? Was that a genie costume ? " Max Wertheimer 's zoetrope . " " Allows for mind transference . " - Get out . - Wertheimer ? He was the gestalt guy in the ' 20s . He pioneered the study of the brain 's thought processes . I spent some time in a psyche ... research facility . Wait a second . Myka said Hugo kept talking about spinning and dancing . Unauthorized removal of artifact . Security measures engaged . Those are my MARAs . Hugo One 's been playing with your toys . They 're for maintenance and repair ? Mostly . Nice ! Run ! Don 't move . Cops are on their way . Okay , look , Leo ... I think you 're kind of stepping in it here , bro . I mean , the thing is , we 're kind of in a hurry . Yeah , no kidding , pretty boy . I saw you on the APB . You 're wanted for kidnapping . That guy , right ? The A.I. It must have accessed the internet through the Warehouse . You think it doesn 't want us to bring Hugo back ? Look , Leo , You 're making a huge mistake , 'cause we 're secret service . I 'm just gonna reach for my badge slowly and I 'm gonna throw it over to you and just take a look at it . - This looks real . - That 's because it is real , Leo . But the secret service protects the president . And the president 's nowhere else around here ! Not as stupid as you thought , huh ? - What ? - Soda pop go " boom " . - Pete , are you okay ? - What 's he talking about ? - I don 't know . - Blast off with Lemon Launch . Remember ? Hugo makes his own Lemony Launches . Houston ... We have a problem . - What 's wrong with him ? - Do not get me started . Doesn 't Leo look thirsty ? What a lark ! Look out ! That 's it ? What the hell ? Billy Jack ! What did you think was gonna happen with the can of soda pop ? What ? The guy built a computer that can have us arrested . I thought his practical jokes would do more than make the floor sticky . Sticky ! - You wanted to chat ? - God , I hate that ! I intercepted Donovan and Fargo attempting to remove an artifact from Allentown-22c . But you didn 't hurt them , right ? The dropping temperatures will soon preclude breaches of protocol . Bully for you . I 'm very happy for you . Listen , Hugo One , I was thinking , you know , while we 're waiting for me to take the big sleep , that you and I , I don 't know , we could pass the time , maybe by playing a game . Attempting to distract me with games is futile . No , I know . I know . But come on , Hugo . You can 't resist playing a game . Any game . I know you can 't . - Does that work ? - No ! Stupid MARAs . - We can 't stay in here forever . - We can stay until the ... Until that thing wakes up . Out , out , out ! We got to get out . - Was that the original ... - Don 't say its name . Trust me on this . It can get ugly . Come on . We 're the biggest brains in the Dakotas and we 're getting our asses kicked . That ring you have , can it amplify anything other than human energy ? - Like for instance ? - For instance ... A laser ? Marry me . D-9 . Miss . E-10 . Hit . You sunk my battleship . Sorry . A-7 . Miss again . If this works , we 'll have a few seconds before it drains the cutter 's charge . If we die , it 's been fun . Agreed . Awesome . Fargo , watch out . It is my destiny . 20 years of practicing in front of the mirror for the best four seconds of my life ! We rule ! I like Todd . I had a completely different thought . No , I mean ... I 'm really sorry . I like you , Fargo . I do , but when we kissed , I was totally thinking of Todd . I really like him . He 's not just some guy . He 's the guy I think about when I impulsively kiss guys I 've just met . We 're still cool , right ? Totally . Okay , good . Let 's find that zoetrope and get it to Artie . This is why Jedi turn to the Dark Side . Come on , Hugo . Artie 's here . He is here . Come on , let 's go see Artie . What 's wrong ? - It won 't open . - Tick-tock , change the lock ! Oh , man . I knew this was gonna happen some day ! The computers have taken over . Step one , kill Pete and Myka . Step two , unleash the nuclear arsenal and then , bam ! Pretty soon we 're all in human breeding camps wearing fur bikinis . Sometimes I think your brain is the artifact . It 's just a program , Pete . Computers can 't think for themselves , all right ? Mine does . E-3 . Hit . You 've won , which is impossible . Well , not when you 've played the way I have . See , I never put any of my battleships on the board . You cheated . You know what I think ? I don 't think that you 're artificial intelligence . You 're Hugo Miller . Part of him , anyway . Pete and Myka have the other part , don 't they ? You ... You don 't know anything about me . I think I know more about you than you do yourself . I know that you loved wearing those hideous leisure suits . And I know you had a fat , orange cat . And I know that you always cheated at games . Used to drive everybody completely crazy . And for some reason , the part of you that loves games is still in there , and the part of you that cheated is not . What the hell happened ? Full programming was discontinued by the regents . Deemed too dangerous . But the potential for human-computer interface is invaluable to the scientific community . And so you took a shortcut . You cheated . You used an artifact . I may have miscalculated . Instead of copying my electro-encephalographic waves , it transferred them . Half of Hugo 's brain didn 't burn out . It 's in the computers . Or the left side , anyway . Compassion and intuition , improvisation , that 's still in Hugo 's body . Hugo , you can 't run the Warehouse with half a brain . I mean , look . I was able to trick you at a child 's board game . Let Pete and Myka come back to the Warehouse with the real Hugo ... And let us try to put your brain back together . I 'm really starting to hate these things . - Well , hello . - No , no , Hugo . That 's a bad sound . I really think that we should just ... I don 't know ! Take cover ! Go ! Get down ! Get down , Hugo ! Artie , we got it . Max Wertheimer 's zoetrope . Hugo Miller could have used this to copy his brain into Hugo One . It 's why he was able to create such a sophisticated A.I. 25 years ago . Except that he 's not an A.I. , and it 's not a copy . That 's really half of Hugo Miller 's brain in there , which is why he can 't function as a full human being . Right , Hugo ? Your argument has merit . The right side of my brain should be reconnected with the left , but not in human form . Inside the computer . You 'll be trapped . The human body fails after a few years . Computers are forever . He has a point . If I help you , then what do I get ? I shall lift the restrictions and abort Falcon Scott protocol . Lattimer and Bering may return to the Warehouse with Miller and complete the transference . If you do this , you know you 'll be killing the real Hugo Miller ? The real Hugo Miller will become his life 's work . All right , okay , Hugo . That thing 's firing freaking laser beams at us , man ! We have to get past that eye . Where is the Tesla ? - It 's in the car . I 'll get it . - Be careful . - Okay , but it 's not fully charged ! - All right , well , it 's our only shot . - I 'm a better shot , I should take it . - Bull . It 's gone . Wait , wait , wait . Hugo ... You go first . - What ? - Just ... All right , I 'll go . Artie , you can 't do this . I know . It 's just ... Hugo One has left us no option . So , this lamp thing is gonna suck out the rest of this poor guy 's brain ? The Warehouse comes first . We all knew that going in . Hello there . Wait . That 's ... - What ? - Yeah , I 'll explain later . Shall we begin ? Artie , we 're not gonna feed a former agent to some pissed off Atari . - What are these things gonna do ? - What are those things gonna do ? Nets , fire , I don 't know . Or spinning blades . No , it 's okay , guys . I got it . Just stay back there and don 't make it angry . That is not necessary . We will do exactly as we 've agreed . Thank you . Until the procedure is complete , all systems will remain on automatic . You will continue to be locked out of any access . Guys ... Could you please hurry , 'cause I already shaved once today ? Please connect the zoetrope to the fail-safe . I 'm sorry . The spinning . Begin . Artie , we can 't . You have to stop this . There 's a person in there . All right , now . - Now what ? - Well , the lights are dimmed . - That 's what happened when Hugo One ... - Was first turned on . Now we 've got a shot because ... Because the transfer might be taking up most of his processing power . - We might get back into the system . - Exactly . You can access the Warehouse through your laptop ? - I hacked in from Switzerland once . - Sweet . - We 're losing him ! - There 's a pass code . - Crack it ! - It 's six digits or letters . - I 'm counting on your hackery . - I need more than 8 seconds . Myka , the picture ! He gave us this code when we visited him . He drew a picture of a cat . He had a fat , orange cat . What was his name ? Fatty , catty , orangey . - Try Orangey ! - No go . - " Orangey " ? Really ? - Albert ! - It 's Albert ! - How do you know that ? 'Cause we went in that store and Hugo said , " Albert grows things " . - Name of his cat is Albert . - I 'm in . All right . Lock him out of everything but this lab . Illegal access . Disengage . Time to set things right . What are you all doing in my office ? You don 't remember ? Remember what ? I was in the middle of a procedure and I ... What the hell is this ? What ? Hugo , buddy , we got a little story to tell you . Let 's go get some ice cream . I can 't . I 'm lactose intolerant . What ? Do you ever think about our future here ? Like , how do we not end up with our brains scrambled or blown up or whatever new way to die there could be ? I mean , look at the bright side . I 'm usually within ten feet of you , so whatever terrible thing happens to you will probably happen to me too . Comforting . You know , when we play rock , paper , scissors , you don 't always have to pick rock . - I don 't always pick rock . - Yes , you do . All right , next time , I will pick scissors . You shouldn 't have told me that . And that should do it . All the recent patches and upgrades . I cannot wait to see all the technical achievements I 've missed . Did Billy Gates ever get that project of his off the ground ? In a way . You will love Eureka . We have a brain-mapping project so up your alley , it has a parking space . If things don 't work out in Eureka , please consider coming back to be with us . - Thanks , but I couldn 't leave Eureka . - Not you . - I 'm so glad you 're back . - Thank you , agent Nielsen . Just call me Artie . Wait . Artie ! We used to play battleship together . - You hated computers . - Yeah , and still do . Maybe there is no such thing as evolution . You and me and MacPherson , we have to get together . Well , that would be nice , but there aren 't as many of us from the old days as there used to be . Good luck . I got it . Thank you for coming . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry we got cut off earlier . Something huge came up and I ... It 's okay . - There 's something I need to tell you . - Me too . Look , I 'm sorry I 've been such a flake lately . My head 's been in a weird place , but I recently got clarity . I don 't think it 's a good idea for me to see you anymore . I 'm sorry .

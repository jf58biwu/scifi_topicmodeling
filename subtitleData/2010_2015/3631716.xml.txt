 * * * * * * * * * * * * And directs us all . So say we all . - I 'm sorry , zoe . It 's god 's will . - No , ben- - - Did I even really know my daughter ? - You think that zoe knew one of the terrorists ? - Dr. Graystone , we think that zoe Might have been one of the terrorists . - Daniel graystone says he can bring my daughter back , But can I trust him ? - The device that I need Is called a meta-cognitive processor . There 's only one company that has this device , And it 's not mine . - I need something stolen From the vergis corporation on tauron . - Daddy . - It 's okay , baby . I 'm right here . - My heart isn 't beating . - I miss you . - Daddy , my heart isn 't beating ! My baby ! She couldn 't feel her heartbeat ! - My daughter died in the maglev bombing , But she continues to exist in the virtual world . - Hi , daddy . - You 're an avatar ... A virtual representation of zoe . - I don 't feel like a copy , daddy . - What are you doing to her ? Stop it , dr.Graystone ! Stop ! - What did you do to her ? - I captured her avatar . She 's in here now . daddy . Daddy ... Daddy ? - Zoe ! - Lacy ? - Who is this ? - It 's me , zoe ... And I think I 'm gonna need your help . Come here ! Who is it ? Who are we gonna meet ? - You 'll see . See this infinity symbol ? It 's the symbol of the soldiers of the one . We 're the ones who are gonna bring The word of the one true god to the people . Ben . Ben , there 's someone here I 'd like you to meet . - She 's perfect . She 'll do it . - It 's all going to change . You 're a gift ... And everyone will know it soon . - Powering down . - What are you talking about ? It 's been working great in the demos for defense . Beyond expectations . - Yeah , and this chassis works great . But take it out , put it in any of the other bodies , And it 's a moron . - Is that true ? - Yes , it 's true . Put this chip in any other body , And it doesn 't innovate , doesn 't anticipate . All the bodies are identical , But the mcp only works in this one . - That can 't be . The bodies are functionally isomorphic . It can 't know which one it 's in . Is this it ? Is this the one ? Wait , is this--is this the same one I was working on ? Is this the prototype ? - Right . We don 't know why it 's happening . In fact , when we put copies of the mcp in other bodies , We expected them to bond too- - but , no , they 're all morons . There 's something unique About the bonding of this chip and body , And if we don 't figure out how to replicate it , This whole contract is in danger . So the military liaison , he 's all over me- - - I get the problem . I 'm gonna miss the jump . Tell you what . Have this whole thing sent to my home lab . I 'll take a look at it this weekend . - Take care of it . - Hey , serge ? - Yes , amanda . - I know we have some old home movie tiles of zoe . Will you help me find them ? - Right away . - Lacy .

I 've been having these dreams , My life and the original zoe 's life all mixed up . - Listen , sister clarice Invited me to her house for lunch tomorrow . She can help us . - No . The only control that I have right now Is that no one knows I 'm in here . Promise me you won 't tell . - Okay . I promise . - They 're taking me to the lab in zoe 's house . Once I 'm there , I might be able to do something . I 'm gonna try to get zoe 's original program- frak ! - Zoe ? Zoe . zoe ! - Great piece of engineering . - Yeah , I know . She gives me the chills . - She ? Dude , stop feminizing it . It 's weird . - - It 's unnatural . - I really don 't think there 's anything wrong With feminizing it . - Nothing wrong except it 's not a person . It 's useful . Just a tool . To - the sto espousesughs , congestion and sore throats .

Oh , my gods . - Wilson elementary . - Yeah , this is willie adama 's--adams ' father . Could you find him , tell him to wait ? I accidentally went to his sister 's school . - Philo , aren 't you done with that thing already ? - Okay , just move your right elbow up By about 45 degrees . Now rotate your hands 90 degrees . - We could have disassembled it and loaded it twice by now . - Okay . Now move your right arm . - It 's equipment , philo . - Move your arm to the right . It 's a work of art . It deserves some dignity . Okay , so if you move your forearm about Three dorans to the right . Okay , great .

I 've never even heard that name . Was he the real bomber ? - Really . Ben stark ? Doctor , he was your daughter 's boyfriend . Take a look at the picture . - My daughter didn 't have a boyfriend . She wasn 't old enough . She died before ... Good night . - Let 's get this thing inside already And call it a day . - I can 't believe he 's actually getting us to come to the lab . He like never , never - - it 's insane--frak ! Frak ! Hey , what do we do , man ? What do we do ? - You stay here . You stay here . You distract her and- - - distract her ?

What 's the matter , your legs broken or something ? - Daddy ? - I wonder why it would freak out like that . Didn 't have any sensory reafference under the cover . Thrashed around , to replace the input . It went nuts , just like a little kid would . - Yeah ? That 's totally cool of it . - Yeah , it is , actually . I mean , this robot ... She 's doing all kinds of things I never thought I 'd see her do . Huh ? Even the way it moves . It 's like you can see it think . - Oh , look at that . It 's all outta whack . Stupid thing must have done it in the van . - Yeah , I 'll run a diagnostic . - No , no , no . I got it . - Still gonna run it . - Hold still . Aah ! Frak ! - Ah ...

She just said that There 'd be a new family waiting for us on gemenon . - A new family ? - Sorry . It 's the last thing I heard her say . - A new family . - So the problem with the mcp Is that it 's only gonna work in this one body . I--and I think , uh , I think the mcp Is diffusing some of its control To the peripheral subunits of this- - Of this particular model . - So ... We 've made exactly one solider ? - Yeah , but , uh ... It 's a really good one . - Well , I 'm glad you like it , but our contract Is for 100,000 robots , philomon . - Hi .

And here , everyone 's so comfortable with everyone . - Yeah , I-I heard ... How you lost your friends . Uh ... You must miss them so much . Zoe graystone was lacy 's best friend . A real tragedy for all of us . She was very special . I mean , she was brilliant . - At computer stuff , right ? That 's my major . Did you know that there are bits of software That you use every day that were written decades ago ? - Is that true ? Oh , that 's amazing . - Yeah . You write a great program , And , you know , it can outlive you . It 's like a work of art , you know ? Maybe zoe was an artist . Maybe her work ... Will live on . - We 're back from the break , and we 're just gonna Take a look around the league right now real quickly , Starting off with a team that 's had A surprisingly poor showing early in the season , That being the caprica city buccaneers . - Hey . - Hey .

No . - Look , I understand how hard it 's been for you to ... To lose your student- - Look , the bombing 's got us all on edge . - You can 't blame us for wondering ... I mean , given your track record . - My track record ? If a student suffers a loss , I help them . The girl 's lost her only friends . I 've done nothing wrong . And if you 'd wipe the slate clean , you 'd see that . - We do , of course ... - We know how hard you work . - Look , I can 't ... Do you mind if I beg off the rest of the clean up ? I 'm going for a walk . - It 's sudden death . Graystone steps up to the line and ... Graystone eyes the shot . Sees the angle . Goal ! What do you say to that , serge ? We 've been over this . - The crowd goes frakking wild , sir . - Thank you . - They 're tearing up the seats . It 's bedlam . - Thank you . Thank you ! - They demand another hour of game time , sir . - Well ... Let 's fix this thing . The same body . Same body this whole time . So why is this one different ? I ... Put her in there ... Now she 's gone . But where ... Where ? She 's not in the mainframe . Where did you go ? So if she 's not in there ... Why can 't we copy you ? - Nice car . Looks like score , but ... But it 's got 350 under the hood , A triple-mounted clutch . Which most knuckleheads will tell you is a bad thing . But if you know anything about cars , You 'll realize that what you really want Is a triple c with an undermount wedge . That way you got control and power . And it 's all about control And power . All right , let 's go . Come on , willie , let 's go . Walk , walk , walk . - You smashed a window . - Don 't worry about it . - Do you understand what you just did ? You just broke a window ! - Relax , relax . - Crap , there 's cops . - All right , stick around . Stick around . Don 't run . You run away , you 're guilty of two things- - The thing and the running away from the thing .

Angry and numb , and- - - Angry at who ? - Everybody and everything . Myself and the world . Her ... The robot . - The robot didn 't do anything . No , it didn 't . I 'm just ... Going a little crazy . - oh , really ? - Yeah . - What 's that like , huh ? - Oh ... Like you don 't know . - I sure love you . And if you still want to go to the memorial , I 'll go with you . Okay ? - Because you 're ready to think ? - Because I promised serge some time alone with the u-87 . I think he 's got a little ... - - Crush . - No . - It 's not pretty . It 's not a pretty thing , but ... They need to be alone . - I still can 't believe they just let us go . - Ha . Well , I told you that was some good advice , wasn 't it ? - Yeah . - Hey , wanna hear some more ? - Sure . - Someone tries to make you feel guilty , You figure out what they feel guilty about . You talk about that . Also , don 't smoke . You know why ? - Uh ... ' cause it 's bad for you , maybe ? - No . Life 's bad for you . You don 't smoke Because they can get genetic data off a cigarette butt now . Yeah . Hey , listen , um , Don 't tell your dad I told you that , okay ? - Mom , you gotta get them in the thing , Or they don 't take ' em . Hello ? - Lacy . - Yes . - It 's zoe . I 'm at the house . I need you . It 's important . - Oh , my god . - There something you want to tell me ? Dress-poi-kolas called . She thought you might be sick 'cause you didn 't show up for class today . - Tauron school is boring . - It 's about us . Finding out who you are . About being tauron . Being part of a family . - It 's hard being part of a family , dad ... When there is no family . But you can punish me if you want . - Come here . - Hey . Very nice . - Haven 't seen you here before . - It 's been a while . - Well , you 've come to the right place To fall off the wagon . - Yeah . I need , uh , privacy , a smoker , And 2 grams of purple . - Right . - I couldn 't believe when you said you were here . Is it really ... - It 's- - It 's me . Lacy--lacy , it 's me . It 's okay . You can take a good look . - Wow . So ... This is you . Your arms and--and ... Your face ... Your voice comes out of here ? And ... And you see here . Look at your arms . - Lacy , you gotta tell me . Do I look male to you ? - Yeah . - Frak . - But you 're here , walking in the real world . Just like zoe said you would . First time I 've ever seen you in the real world , ever . - Yeah , but I 'm trapped ! I get manhandled and ordered around . They loaded me like cargo . One guy touched me , and I hurt him , lacy . God . - I-I don 't know how to help you . What are you gonna do ? - I 've already started some of it . I went into the computer and checked . Zoe 's original program was destroyed When he put me in here . So at least he won 't be putting any more of me In more robots . God , it 's confusing . I mean , I 'm zoe ... And the avatar , and the robot . Like some kind of whatchacallit--three-parter . - Trinity . That 's what you are . Three faces of one thing . Sort of . Zoe ... - My mom called me a monster . - To be fair ... - I think I could live with this much better . - My son overslept , So he had to take the train instead of walking . If I 'd just ... - Do you wanna say something ? - Gods , no . What would I say ? I think I see some parents from the school over there . Should go and say hello . - Oh , no . No . Sweetheart , please don 't talk to people . You 'll be everyone 's shoulder to cry on . I 'll never be able to get you out of here . Please . - Or you could say nothing all day long . Is that better ? - He liked to walk . He would have thanked me if I woke him up . - But I didn 't do it . - I told mom she was getting too old to take the lev . I don 't understand How something like this could have happened . I love you , mom , and I 'm so sorry . - Amanda graystone ? - Yes . - Natalie stark . Ben 's mom . Zoe 's boyfriend . - There were people everywhere asking for help . But I didn 't know what to do for them . I was in the back car , and we were all shook up . - So you don 't return phone calls . - It 's okay . Sean , it 's okay . Why don 't you go get a drink ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry about the calls but , uh ... It 's been , uh ... Ha . It 's been crazy at work . - You sent your bodyguard away . You 're either very confident I 'm not gonna hurt you Or you 're afraid I 'm gonna talk about a certain theft . - I 've gone through his room , And there were things zoe left . Costume jewelry , school papers . I thought you 'd want them . He loved her very much . I 'm sorry . - Thank you . Thank you . thank you . - A group known as soldiers of the one Has claimed responsibility for the bombing . Now , as I 'm sure you all know , The sto espouses a monotheistic Religious philosophy . - Dr. Graystone , We think that zoe might have been one of the terrorists . - A purse-snatcher , yes ... But a mom ? I don 't understand How something like this could have happened . - Well ... - I need to see her again . - You wanna talk , we can talk . Just call my office , and we 'll set up a time . - I need to see tamara . The tamara that you made . - She 's gone . She 's gone . It--it was a beta test . I went back in to iron out some of the kinks , And zoe 's avatar was gone . - So because zoe 's gone , you know tamara 's gone ? - It makes sense that they would disappear at the same time . - What ? She didn 't disappear when I took that band off ? - No . From her point of view , you disappeared , not her . - So she might be all alone in there ... Not knowing where I went ? Maybe stuck Between dead or alive . - Every one of you ... - Not knowing what she is or why her heart doesn 't beat ! - That 's come up here today has talked about ... How much you miss the people that you lost . I do miss zoe . I miss her with every breath . I don 't really know what it is that I 'm missing . My daughter had a whole life And a boyfriend that I knew nothing about . Beliefs that I don 't ... I don 't understand at all . - Hey , grandma , have you seen my pyramid game ? - No , dear . - Looking back , I think that she ... - Only showed me what she wanted me to see . I just didn 't know her ! You 've all talked about ... How guilty you feel . It 's our job . We create life , and then ... One day we have to face ... Who they are ... What they become and what they do . My daughter , zoe graystone , Died in the bombing of maglev train number 23 . But I think she may have caused it . - This was hers . - I found this ! My daughter was part of the soldiers of the one ! - Sean . Sean , get over here . Have dell bring the car . - My daughter was a terrorist ! I 'm sorry ! My daughter was part of the soldiers of the one . She was a terrorist ! - Get back ! - Drive , drive . Drive , drive , drive . - Killers ! - Murderers !

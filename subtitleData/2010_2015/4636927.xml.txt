 Too hot . It 's 9 : 28 , kiddo . It 's perfect . Trust me . It 's too cold . Really ? Yeah . You know , you could get it yourself , and that way , it would be exactly the way you want it . Yeah , I know . Or I could get it . Gary ? Gary ? Gotcha . It died again . Where 's the cord ? It 's over there . You like them runny or well done ? Runny . Sorry . I overcooked them . Milos Kosar . Intel says Red Flag 's most aggressive operations are run through his cell . He doesn 't look so scary . This man nearly had us all killed , Nina . He was the one who sent the Ghost after us . He 's our prime suspect in 10 other cases . I 'm the one who found him . I followed his cell phone . Yes , you did , Gary . Thank you very much . It was easy . Can I keep the vest ? Gary , please . I can 't concentrate . Please stop with the straps . Six heartbeats on the perimeter , three in the house . Three heartbeats inside the house . Copy that , Bill . All right , copy that . No names over the comms , please . Over . Team two , there 's three unfriendlies on the inside . Copy that ? Over . Copy . Team two , are you good to go ? Hell yeah . My vest smells like cop sweat . Team one and team two in position . Over . They don 't know that we 're here . Element of surprise is still ours . Intel says they 're planning something any day now . My gut says move . Yeah , what does the rest of you say ? Look , these are your people . You know them better than I do . Gum ? Keeps the mouth from getting too dry . That always happens on these kind of deals , you know ? You get the dry mouth because of all the adrenaline . Yeah , maybe I will . Thanks . Going to need two minutes to get in position behind the door . That 's pretty exposed . When the signal comes , run for the door . I 'll get you in . You know who we are , right ? In our briefing , they said you guys were civilians . They said that , huh ? SWAT ? Do I look like I don 't know what I 'm doing ? FBI . At least I still think I am . Set here , one . Heartbeat 's steady . All right , let 's go . Rachel . Good to go . Team one . All right , Iet 's do this . Call it , team two . One . We 're a go . Milos , we 've got company ! Moving in ! Moving in ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Here we go ! Here we go ! Let 's make it critical ! Go ! Eyes on the target ! Bill ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Bill , can you hear me ? Bill ? Two heartbeats moving . One static ! Rachel , do you copy ? Bill , do you hear me ? Only picking up one heartbeat in the back room . - Not moving . - Move , move , move ! Rachel , what 's going on ? Why did that happen ? It 's static in the back room . Bill , do you hear me ? There 's only one heartbeat in the back room now . Anna , if you can hear me , blink once for yes , twice for no . Her senses work , but her ability to understand and communicate is compromised . Most likely autistic . Low functioning at the far end of the spectrum . Harken says the home is in her name . No family . No one to complain when Red Flag moves in . So , what do we do with her ? Good question , Nina . It 's a lot of plans and technical information . I 'll have someone check it out . The good news , these guys boogied out of here so fast , they left a lot of evidence . There 's singe marks here and on the lighting fixture . This is definitely not your typical blackout . What about this computer ? It 's encrypted . That 's a neat little trick they pulled off . In all the confusion they must have just jumped out the side window . They just walked away ? Uh , yeah , after they blacked out everything , somehow they got away . That was a statement , Mr. Hicks , not a criticism . Sounded like a criticism to me . Are you kidding me ? They sent us in here against Alphas with unknown skills , and somehow , we 're supposed to know every angle . I thought that was DOD 's job . The best clue we have right now is this home . Might still pick up incoming signals from Red Flag . So , what about the girl , Anna ? Uh , I 'll make some calls , see if I can get her into a home . In the meantime , Sullivan 's people will keep a watch out for the three of you . The three of us ? Meaning me ? Yes , I want Gary here , scanning for signals . I 'm supposed to babysit ? Yes , just keep him focused . He gets the egg salad at 1 : 30 . The question of who is normal isn 't medical . It 's political . If you hear voices , are depressed , are attracted to the same sex , if you believe in God , or believe in nothing , at one point or another , society has branded you with the stigma of mentally deficient . We are not normal by any strict definition , but we reject the label of deficient . Okay , I think we get it . In many ways ... Well , hang on a second . Doc , this is the stuff we took from the house , right ? Yes . And that frightens them . Shouldn 't we let it finish ? This is the remote for the Blu-Ray . It 's just some pieces I 've seen before . This is more propaganda for their followers . We need to discuss Milos Kosar . No , that sounded like a mission statement to me , Doc . Now , if Red Flag has a plan , wouldn 't this help us figure it out ? Murdering their enemies is their plan , Cameron . You know that better than anyone . Can we move on , please ? This conversation 's done . Bill , what have we got ? This , uh , triggering device . Doc , can we ... Can we please get a proper conference table ? Triggering device ? Yeah , a detonator so you can blow something up by remote . Found a lot of other stuff , too , and a ton of info on Northwell Petroleum . It 's a regional fuel company . There 's the goal we 're talking about . So the big guy 's strong ... Hmm . John Woo guy 's got aim . What do you do ? I can fly . Really ? Yeah . Laser beams shoot right out of my eyes . All right . Forget I asked . I know you 're saying something , but I ... I don 't understand . Nina ! Don 't answer . All right . What 's up , Gary ? I said don 't answer . You have a listening problem . Put it on mute . Hitting mute . Now I 've got a signal . I can look at your sounds . Okay , Anna , I can see it now . I can see the sounds . Okay , I can see the ... You . This is you . Can ? Can . This comes after the " I. " What 's next ? Help . Help what ? Okay , " Help . " I ... " I can help you find them . " " I can help you find them " ? Huh . No , the signal that I found in my bathroom , that was Kosar 's cell phone . But I couldn 't understand the voice . It 's just ... It 's bloops and scratches . But it 's not a voice . It 's her language . And she 's the only one that can speak it . She invented it . Red Flag must have used her to encode some of their transmissions . No , all of their transmissions . She understands everything . She can understand me , Gary ? Yeah , she understands everything . Every language . Every language ? Yeah . Ni vyema kukutana na wewe . Huh . " It 's nice to meet you too , Dr. Rosen . " She says . That 's a message for you from Anna . Swahili . Chinese . Even some obscure Hindi dialect I picked up from a yoga instructor in Dharmshala . She understands it all , Nina . I guess you do , too , Mr. Modest . She 's a virtual Rosetta Stone . She 's a living , breathing universal language translator . Yeah , I know what a Rosetta Stone is , thanks . I looked through her case history , and she has been consistently diagnosed as severely autistic and sometimes even mentally disabled . But that 's not the case . What she has is severe apraxia . It 's a condition which affects speech and other motor skills . She may not be able to sign or nod hello , but her language and pattern recognition is ... It 's enormously enhanced . She has taken all the sounds that she can make , and she has created her own , unique language , and no one noticed . No one noticed that she is an Alpha . Gary did . Yes , Gary did . And so did Red Flag . Hmm . You know , with Gary 's help , she could translate every message on that tablet . And we don 't have to chase after Kosar . We find out where he 's going . So we take her back to the office . No . No , uh ... Familiarity , continuity , the , you know , the day to day ... It 's very important , given her condition . I think they should stay here . Rosen . Lee , do you have any idea what time it is ? Uh ... Sandra . Hi , sweetie . I 'm not going to bed . I missed 9 : 30 , so I 'm gonna stay up . All night ! You can 't get him off schedule like this . I know , Sandra , I 'm very sorry . But he doesn 't adapt well . I know , I know . I know this is good for Gary , but , uh ... This can 't keep happening . He met a girl . A girl ? She 's about his age , and I 've never seen him take to anyone so quickly . Well , is she , uh ... Well , she has some cognitive disabilities , yes . Like Gary . Uh , not as social . But , um , she 's quite extraordinary in her own way . Wow . Well ... That 's , um ... That 's good . It is . Yeah , it is . That 's good . And , uh , I promise , no more late nights . Okay . Good night . Good night . Dr. Rosen wants us to translate all of them . Anna . Okay ? He thinks your special language abilities will help us decode the encrypted emails on this tablet . Hey , Anna , what 's this ? I just want the email . You 're controlling this . With those sounds . You have a secret , Anna . Now we can really talk . Ha ! One friend to another . You sound like the lady on my voice mail . That 's really cool , Anna . The things you can do are amazing . No . No , it 's not so amazing . Dr. Rosen says that a part of my brain just ... It grew bigger than other people 's . And so , I ... I can see all the waves that float around . What do they look like ? They look like colors and shapes . Hey , Gary , you working in there ? No , I 'm talking to Anna about myself . She thinks that I 'm amazing . I do , too , Gary . Just get back to work , okay ? Yeah . Anna , we have to get back to work . Where does Dr. Rosen want us to start ? The first message . The one that I followed here . This one . The brownout was localized to an area directly around the home , and it gets stranger from there . The carpet 's singed and the fibers clump together in dense patterns . It 's really strange . I 've never seen anything like it before . See ? No , I can 't , Rachel , but I trust you . Some sort of static electrical interference , hmm ? Maybe . It was powerful and tightly controlled . That 's our Alpha skill right there . Now , at least we know what we 're up against . Doc . I found something . Gary sent me a ton of these , but this is the one that caught my attention . U-S D-O-T ? Department of Transportation . It 's a routing number for a Northwell Petroleum truck that 's on the road right now . So he 's gonna blow up a fuel truck . No , ' cause we 're gonna stop him . I hate these faucets , you know ? The sensors never work . We okay ? Yeah . What 's the problem ? Ignition is electric . Ah , give it a minute . It 'll bleed off . Explosives . Yeah . Are they in place ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . It 's good . Be careful with this . Second car 's in place , ready on your go . Tell your guys to be extremely careful . Rosen says this guy can conduct electricity or something . " Something like that . " That 's great . Yanks have a day game against Boston today . I 'd love to make it home in time for that . Target in sight . Satellite has confirmation on the USDOT number . It 's a match . Let 's go . Let 's do it . Mobile one to mobile two , we 're gonna divert target west at intersection . Target coming your way . Locked in on target . We got him . Out of the cab ! Now ! Hands up where I can see ' em ! Where 's the bomb ? Bomb ? I got no idea what you 're talking about ! It 's not Kosar . It 's not him ! You checked the number ? And did you re-check the number , Bill ? Of course . What about the driver ? Are we certain he is who he says he is ? For all I know , he could 've been Mark Sanchez , okay ? But he wasn 't Kosar . It wasn 't him . Look , we put a scare in him back in Montclair . It is possible that he ditched the plan . No , no . Not Milos Kosar . He 's an ideologue , and he is not easily intimidated . He 's out there with a bomb , and I ... Which I assume he 's going to use , and we have no idea where he 's going . Nina ? I want Gary at the office as soon as possible . We need him . I need help sometimes . A woman comes to buy groceries and pay bills , but I 'm in charge of my own life . I 'd like to buy my own clothes . My mom won 't let me . She won 't let me buy a leather jacket like the one The Streets . You don 't need Doctor Rosen or your mother to take care of you . You 're really smart . Yeah , I am really smart . I don 't ... I don 't like to do some things . Anna , you don 't know me well . Mmm . I don 't like to take care of myself . I think I know you a little bit . Yeah . Okay , is this right ? Only one mistake . No , I got that right . The date ... It should say 2011 . Count to 10 . Anna , count to 10 . I want to check something . Anna . Maybe you 're right . Yeah , I know . But count to 10 , 'cause I wanna check this . It could be something else . Never mind . Gary ... Hi , um ... I need to take Gary with me . Rosen wants us back . Yeah , I want to stay . Wasn 't an offer , Gary . Well , I 'm not leaving . No ... You 're going . We both are . Uh ... No . No , I 'm staying . Hey , Gary , just get in the car now . Hey ! Don 't try and push me . Excuse me ? You 're trying to push me , and it doesn 't work on me . No , I know it doesn 't work , and I wasn 't . So what 's eating you ? Ha ! That 's a stupid question . Nothing 's eating me . I 'm not leaving . Okay , big shot . Well , who 's gonna take you back ? I am . The big shot will drive himself back . Or I 'll call a cab , since I don 't have a car . Gary , I don 't have time for this . Just get in the car now . I 'm not leaving ! I 'm not a big shot . I 'm an adult . And I don 't have to do what you say . It 's the end of the conversation . Okay . My CO guy used to say , never let the fight get personal . Well , they tried to kill me , Cameron . It doesn 't get more personal . Don 't you want to know why ? I know why . I stood in their way . Apparently , Red Flag doesn 't need any more justification than that . Okay . You know , you make things personal , you get emotional . You get emotional , you make mistakes and you overlook stuff . I seem to remember someone telling me that about my Alpha skill . Don 't be cute . Uh , okay . You wanna catch this guy , I get it . Just let him be the one that makes the mistakes . I 'm glad you stood up for yourself . I 'm glad you stayed here with me . I like you , Gary . Then why did you lie to me ? I knew that there was something weird about the date . 'Cause 10 was 20 . And you ... You didn 't want to explain . So , I went back through the messages . And if I thought that a two was a one , then the first code that you gave me was wrong . And that 's why the truck was empty . And you don 't make mistakes with that . 'Cause that 's your Alpha skill . You gave me the wrong number on purpose . But that was smart . You were smart . Because if you just made something up , I would have known . So , you made it close , and you changed the number so that we wouldn 't find the real truck . I had to , Gary . I know you did , because they weren 't making you do anything . You work for them , Anna . You work for Red Flag . No , Gary , I don 't work for them . They work for me . This is really bugging me . This doesn 't make any sense . Okay , so we 're assuming that Red Flag ditched their plan , right ? But did ... You know she can smell your hands were on that , right ? No . She 's gonna smell that your nasty hands were on that thing . Anyway , we 're assuming that Red Flag ditched the plan , right ? But the driver finished his route in Pennsylvania , which means that the truck was empty by the time we got to the road . So , the question is , why would Red Flag plan to go after a truck with no fuel in it ? Exactly . Hmm . You know what I would love to see ? A unicorn sliding down a rainbow ? No , I would love to see a list of all the Northwell trucks on the road right now with fuel in them . 2652 is on I-95 . South ? Yep , heading south . There 's no way we can cover all those trucks at once , even if I can convince someone that I 'm right . I think you 're right . I don 't just translate the messages . I write them . My friends trust me . If you were with us , we would trust you , too . Huh . We would never treat you like a child . Yeah , well ... I could figure it out . 'Cause I know the real number . So , I could figure out the plan . I 'm sure you could . Yeah , I could , but ... It 'd be better if you just told me where they were going . Anna , I don 't want anyone to get hurt . If you were my friend , then you 'd tell me . You are my friend , and I will tell you . Okay , good . I don 't want to hurt anyone , either . But , sometimes , we don 't have a choice . There 's a drug to prevent birth defects . But lots of things are considered birth defects . You 're not answering my question . Now , you 're telling me something else . Alphas . That 's the word Dr. Rosen used , right ? Women who take this drug won 't give birth to any more Alphas . But why would they do that ? That doesn 't make any sense . Society can 't deal with people like us . We need to send a message to them . We are not a problem to be fixed . Make a choice for yourself , Gary . All you have to do is say nothing . You haven 't answered me . What are you going to do ? I never made my own friends . I ... I know people . And they say that they 're my friends , but ... I didn 't meet them , Iike how I met you , Anna . I know , Gary . Yeah , so ... Are you really my friend ? Or ... Were you just pretending so that I 'd send them the wrong information ? Of course , I 'm your friend . Okay , good . 'Cause I just ... I did something . Sneaky . And ... I don 't think that you 're gonna like it . Sullivan , I 'm not saying it won 't cause panic . You know , maybe it will cause panic . But you tell me , what other choice do we have ? Bill ... No , tell ... Tell ! Look , you could send 20 squad cars to Manhattan to stop the ones heading there . Bill , you need to look at this . I 'll call you back . I want him here , Nina . We need Gary 's skills . Was I unclear about that ? Shouldn 't you ask Gary why he doesn 't want to come back ? You don 't think I get it ? Yes , Gary has met someone like him . It 's new . It 's exciting . But that doesn 't make his behavior any less juvenile . And it doesn 't make you leaving him there ... I didn 't leave him there . He wanted to stay . Any less irresponsible . I 'm not his mom , and I 'm not his babysitter ! Let 's go . Trenton , New Jersey . Montclair Pharmaceuticals . What 's going on ? Gary found Kosar . We got a truck loaded with fuel headed to the Montclair plant . Now , apparently , there 's a new drug that Red Flag wants to destroy before anyone gets a chance to take it . I don 't understand . He texted you this ? Yeah . Well , how did he get the number wrong in the first place ? Doc , it was the girl the entire time . She is Red Flag . The girl ? Yes ! She gave us the wrong information to give her guys more time to move . Gary 's still there . Bill ! You and Hicks go ahead . We 're gonna go get Gary . Rachel ... This is Kosar we 're talking about . Come on , this is our shot . I know . Go get him . Let 's go ! Let 's go , let 's go . I 'm sorry that I had to do it . Anna , I had to because your friend Kosar , he tried to kill Dr. Rosen , and that 's wrong . Rosen isn 't like us . He 's not an Alpha . No , he 's not , but he is my friend . Anna , you don 't have to worry , okay ? I 'm gonna make sure that nothing bad happens to you . Dr. Rosen 's gonna help you now . Like how he 's helped me . I don 't need his help . And neither do you . I hope someday you 'll see that . No ... They 're coming . Whoa ! No ! Stop ! Hey ! Hey ! It 's through the gate . All right , it 's the R and D building on the southeast corner of the campus . That is the target . Evacuate immediately . Okay , take the wheel . What ? Take the wheel ! We can 't wait for the timer ! Get it as close as you can ... And then blow it ! Where you going ? Hicks , the truck ! Don 't blow it up . Thanks , Bill . Just let me concentrate . Hold it steady ! Hicks , you ready ? I 'm on it ! - Freeze ! - Go get Kosar ! Gary ? Gary ? Gary ? Are you , uh ... Are you all right ? Gary ! I have a headache . Are you ... Are you hurt anywhere ? No . Hi , Nina . Hey . Where 's Anna ? I don 't know , Gary . I don 't know . She was gone when we got here . Oh , I need my phone . Here , here it is . Thank you . You 're okay , right ? Yeah . Gary , I ... I know you liked Anna , but remember , I 'm your friend , too . Yeah ... I know . But you 're not one of us . You 're not . Gary , I don 't make distinctions like that . Now , I don 't know what Anna told you , but I want you to remember that Red Flag is just a small group of people with some very extreme ideas . Yeah , I know . You already told me that ... Before . I sent you an email , Dr. Rosen , and you should read it . You wanna test it ? No . I 'm not going back down . No , if it 's too cold , then I can get it myself . I can take care of myself . Okay . Good night , Mom . Good night , sweetie . I love you . I 'm sorry , Gary . I hope you are still my friend . The drug makers and educators have been warned . If they try to bring this poison to market , we will act again ... And we will continue to do so until they understand true neurodiversity cannot be limited by their small minds . We picked this up over an open frequency . They didn 't bother to encode it , so I had our speech analyst take a look . The writing matches ... It 's her , no question . Hicks warned me , and I did not listen . I underestimated this young woman . And not just her ability , but the strength of her argument as well . I 'm not getting your point , Rosen . What , are you switching sides ? No , this drug was designed to limit the chances of brain damage in infants . If it had gone to market , it may indeed have prevented other Alphas from being born . I don 't know that . All I know is that there 's good guys and bad guys , and today , your people put the bad ones in the ground . Yes , they did . And I can appreciate that . I can have two conflicting thoughts at the same time . Something Don Wilson used to say . I hardly knew the man . Fine , stay conflicted . But all this is , is a bunch of criminals who used an issue to try to expand their reach . Maybe . I want to show you something . Wilson and I always thought Red Flag was a loose network of 50 to 100 affiliates . A cartel , but ... When Anna flooded Gary with messages we got quite a different picture . This more than a criminal enterprise . This is a movement .

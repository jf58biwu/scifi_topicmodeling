 Incoming flight . Incoming flight . Whoa . I 'm fine . I 'm fine . Incoming flight . What we did was ... Under the circumstances The work is what 's important . What we did was ... Fine . It 's fine . Yeah . What we did was biology . I 'm okay , really . Okay . Incoming flight . Incoming flight . Incoming flight . I 'm fine . I 'm fine too . Incoming flight . Incoming flight . What do you think ? Good or bad ? Considering we never got the call out , probably bad . Definitely bad . Military ? No . My corporate patrons . Lower your weapons , sir . Dr. Farragut , isn 't it ? It 's so nice to finally meet you . I 'm Constance Sutton , chief operating officer of the Ilaria Corporation , parent company of Arctic Biosystems . I 'm here for one reason only . To help you . First thing I need is a working line to the CDC . Am I to understand that the communication satellite went down ? Unfortunately , I don 't have a magic telephone . I 'm under the same constraints as everyone . What about your helicopters ? They 're out of range . Be back in two days ' time . I 'm afraid you 're stuck with me and my boys until then . Two hours in a helicopter . Ouch . I 'm sorry you had a rough journey . So , Alan , how goes the search for a cure ? Slowly . Hence , the fact that I 'm here wearing combat boots . But ifs time for us to create a new paradigm between our corporation and the CDC . What do you need from ilaria to contain this terrible disease ? An integral member of my team , Dr. Walker , is trapped down on Level R. I need her back . Impossible . Dr. Hatake , please . Let 's square the circle . Dr. Walker , why is she locked up ? She 's infected . I 'm so sorry . She 's an expert in RNA structure . And that 's important because ? RNA carries the message . We store the instructions for the cure in the DNA and then the RNA passes it on . That makes her the most important member of my team . Well , ilaria is about value-add . If Dr. Walker is what you need , Dr. Walker is what you will get . Lt. Klein , let 's prepare a plan to retrieve Dr. Walker . Yes , ma 'am . Alan , one thing . One thing only , a cure . Please . Now , Dr. Hatake , may we have a word ? In private , if you don 't mind . Constance . Hiroshi . Two things , Hiroshi ! Two simple things . That 's all we needed . I created your virus . Where is the cure ? Virus and cure . One without the other is meaningless . We don 't wanna kill everybody just thin the herd a bit . And rule them . It 's time . We 've waited long enough . You know that . There have been a few setbacks . You failed . Thank God , the CDC arrived to do your job for you . For you . Hm . What is this other strain I 'm hearing about ? Narvik-B , the one that turns people into ... An alternate attempt at the virus . Why ? The cure has been elusive in the A strain . Perhaps the B strain ... Perhaps you are full of shit , Hiroshi . It 's the Willis Hypothesis . We said no then . Nothing has changed . Virus and cure . Simple . Do you really plan to go down to Level R ? To get this Walker ? Yes . If Dr. Farragut needs her , he gels her . The cure is in his hands now . And then ? And then we follow normal null protocol , no witnesses . These people are my employees , my responsibility . No one gets out alive , Hiroshi . You knew that before we started . What about the CDC ? If they fail to return ? We have people in place to control such things . And if I find out that you betrayed us ... the only thing left of you , or this facility will be a blackened scar on the ice . Now say it . Say it . No one gets out alive . Aw ! Come on ! Please ? Begging ? Thought you military guys were tough . Just one hand even , so I can hold on . No . How much farther ? Far . " Far " Are you mocking me ? Would you prefer I sang " One Hundred Bottles of Beer " ? I 'd rather you shut your mouth . Well , then untie me and I promise you won 't hear a word . Or I could just speed up , you fall off , and then I won 't have to hear you yapping . I like my plan better . We need to talk . About ... About Sutton . What about her ? I don 't think she 's telling us everything . Not with what Hatake 's put us through . What do you mean ? What I mean is I don 't think our agenda is her agenda . Right . Where 's the profit in sending Sutton and her private army here ? Especially when we 're cleaning up their mess for free . Big pharma . Only interested in the bottom line . They don 't wanna help people . Who knows how far they 'll go to protect their investment ? We can 't stop working on a cure . No , too many lives at stake . But we do not work for Sutton . We keep the cure from her . We may need it . Unh ! Unh ! Cafeteria is now open . Cafeteria is now open . Daniel . Hatake 's adopted son . Though on some level you do realize that we pay your salary , yes ? So you 've already bought me . Paid for excellent service , rather . Did you have a chance to meet this Dr. Walker ? Yeah . I 'm feeling some pushback , Daniel , and I 'm extremely busy , so I need a quick win on this one , okay ? Okay . I need full intel on Walker before I return her to Dr. Farragut , and , well , let 's be honest , Hiroshi is not gonna tell me anything . There 's not much to tell . Heh , heh . I like you , Daniel , and I don 't want to start our relationship with you lying to me . I wasn 't aware that we had a relationship . Hm . Loyalty , I understand . Hell , I even admire it . So let 's skip the negatives and get straight to the positives . You are very good at your job . And Hatake is not gonna be in charge of this place forever . Just think on it , Daniel . Please . Hiroshi has destroyed everyone who 's ever been close to him . Don 't let him do the same to you . Handy . The U.S. military abandoned 67 of these early-warning stations across the Arctic . Someone should put them to use . How about untying my hands ? You need your hands to sleep ? You 've got the gun . Yeah , you make a good point . I 'm just saying , let 's be reasonable . Okay . Okay . I think it 's reasonable to hogtie you . Make sure you don 't get any ideas about running off . Come on ! I need to get back upstairs . I need to get to Alan . My blood could have antibodies . There 's a guy in Australia . His blood plasma saved 2 million babies . We only have to save 40 or 50 people . This would be so much easier if you were real . I 'm better than nothing . Barely . Are you connected to my silver eyes ? Is that why I 'm seeing you ? Is that your hypothesis ? You know I 've always hated the Socratic method . Fine . Maybe it 's temporary light sensitivity . Or non-episodic cluster headaches . Maybe you 're just going blind . Better than dead , I guess . Or maybe ... Maybe you 're survivor zero . The first one cured . But if I 'm cured , why am I still hallucinating ? I have an even better question . Why are you hallucinating me instead of Alan ? Sutton is trying to turn me against you . Of course she is . Just wanted to let you know . Sutton can be a dangerous enemy . I understand . No . You don 't . She destroys anything that gets in her way . She said something similar about you . What is it you want from me ? Your trust . I 'm trying to protect you . But there is one thing you can do . Under no circumstances can Sutton be allowed to gain access to Dr. Walker . Why is Walker so important ? Is it about the cure ? I never cared about the cure . But I thought that 's why ... Is it not enough that I asked for your help ? I think Sutton will kill Walker . I do not wish that outcome . You should get closer to the heater . Are you really gonna sleep ? That 's what tired people do . Jeez , you can 't even speak Spanish correctly . That 's because it 's Portuguese . See ? Horrible Spanish . Heh . Where 's your home ? Espírito Santo . Just north of Rio . I really am sorry . You know , about the missing kids . As a child , we were warned to stay near the hunting camps . Otherwise , the Qalupalik would take us . Qalu-who ? The Boogeyman . Child-stealer . But I grew up and discovered my Boogeyman was real . Mine too . A lot of kids go missing in Espírito Santo ? Yeah . Ugh . Fine . I don 't like you . But I 'm sorry about whatever you went through . Dr. Farragut . Ms. Sutton . Please , call me Constance . So how is the search for the cure progressing ? It isn 't , without Dr. Walker . I thought we had an understanding . You take care of the lab work , I 'll take care of everything else . I 'm afraid you didn 't square the circle on that one , Constance . Plans are in motion . My security team will be going down to retrieve Dr. Walker very soon . And I 'll be going with them . I 'm afraid that 's a non-starter . We can 't allow anything to happen to you . Dr. Walker is a member of my team . I need to guarantee her safety . I 'm sensing you have some trust issues . If I don 't go , no one goes . Suit yourself . But you will have an armed escort at all times . I wouldn 't have it any other way . Hm . Perimeter alert . Perimeter alert . Perimeter al ... Miksa . The hell are you doing here ? You mean alive ? Miksa . You even feel like him . Who the hell are you ? He says you think your name is Daniel . Your name is Miksa . You were taken from us as a child . Listen , I don 't know who you think I am . I 've been searching for you my entire life . My brother . What is this ? What are you trying to pull ? Don 't look at me . She 's got another one exactly like you back home . Your brother , your twin . Tulok . Impressive . But I can use Photoshop too . Take him to isolation . I 'll deal with her . Attention . Code 157 , Level G. ... two , three , four . Four steps to the table . One , two , three steps to the cabinet . Ah ! One step to the cart . Gotta remember that . Dr. Hatake ? Is that you ? Peter ? Nice to see you 've made yourself at home . Hiroshi , who is Julia Walker ? Why haven 't you mentioned her ? Why would I ? Well , you briefed us on that poor dead veterinarian , Doreen ... Walker seemed unimportant . Dr. Farragut seems to think she 's the exact opposite of unimportant . She 's his ex-wife . Ah . Nepotism . Is that his reasoning ? Perhaps . And what is yours ? Recruiting . I have files on all CDC scientists . So she is important . I chose not to recruit her , so , no , I don 't believe so . A difference of opinion then . Good . Human Resources problems I can understand . I 'll tell you what , Hiroshi , I will personally arbitrate Dr. Walker 's importance or lack thereof , when I go down to Level R and pull her out . Where is she ? She 's in a lab we set up for triage . R-17 . Hiroshi . Let 's not forget which side you 're on . Access granted . Ever use one of these ? Recently . Dr. Farragut . You wanna come with us ? Take the gun . Scheduled cleaning , Level B. Scheduled cleaning , Level B. Do you really think you can trust them ? No , but you saw what happened when we went down there alone . All these guns around . Might as well use them to get what we want . Go get Julia , please , so that we can all go home . Balleseros . Dr. Farragut . - Hey , hey , hey . - Dr. Farragut . Please . Slop it . That man killed Dr. Boyle . The Army en ... You killed a member of the CDC who was trying to find a cure for this virus ? I promise you , I will make this man pay . You have neither the time nor the wherewithal to handle this right now . I do . This is not your concern . No , but if my men handle this , that puts you back in the lab faster , and that is very much my concern . Give me a minute with the prisoner . Get ready for insertion and retrieval . Ma 'am . Dismissed . Shit . What was that for ? You murdered 25 percent of the workflow we need for the cure . How about I kill 25 percent of you ? Come on , Constance . Ms. Sutton . What am I paying you for ? Virus . Cure . Wrong . That is what ilaria pays you for . I , on the other hand , tasked you with finding me proof that Hatake has gone off the rails . Last time you checked in , you were on to something . Sorry to disappoint you . I 've been busy trying not to get killed . So you have nothing , except excuses . And a perforated spleen . You created the Hatake situation . Don 't you blame me for your mess . That 's why I like you , Serge . You 're either very brave or very , very foolish . Apparently both . Unh ! A brave fool is still a fool . Unh . So are you gonna take these off , or am I still in a time-out ? I need Alan as an ally . Releasing you will be the quickest way to screw that up . You 're kidding , right ? Do I ever kid ? So I stay ? So you stay . Plus , I 'm not sure you would survive an encounter with that Daniel character . Thanks for the vote of confidence . Oh , now , if I were you , I would think that my soft kisses are all the vote I needed . Lt. Klein . Throw him in isolation . Access granted . Dr. Walker . Where were you ? What happened here ? Was it the other scientists ? No , a vector . Are you hurt ? It was here , in front of me , ready to attack , and then it just ... And then it just stopped . Dr. Walker , you look better . Alive . Healthy . Possibly going crazy . All of the above . This is wonderful . Yeah , except for the crazy part . Could do without that . I 'll need to draw blood . Run diagnostic tests . I 've done all the tests . There 's no sign of the virus . The only thing ... Ow ! Unh ! My eyes hurt . There 's something happening to my eyes . Everything 's blurry - Sit here . Let me get you some bandages . Close your eyes . Are you okay ? Level E. My sit-reps indicate these vectors are fast and strong ? Level F. Like nothing you 've ever seen . And the others ? Human . Suffering prolonged and fatal cellular breakdown due to the Narvik-A strain . Level E. Or not suffering at all . You said there were healthy people ? There were . Now I don 't know . Level R. Red , take point . Yes , sir . - Quarters . - Clear . Clear . Lab R-17 ? This way , I think . You heard the man . Let 's go . Roger that . Can you walk ? Yes . Why ? We need to leave this place . Why ? There is a woman coming down here to kill you . What are you talking about ? I 'll explain everything , but right now , we need to leave . Does Alan know about this ? He 's coming down with her . Alan would never ... He doesn 't know what she 's capable of . I do . You have to come with me . No . I wanna wait for Alan . If you do you 'll die . You have to trust me . Julia ... please . Okay . Access granted . Alan , wait a moment . Make entry . Single shots , no bursts . Dr. Walkers precious cargo . On my mark . Ready . Breach . Look out ! Behind us . Full retreat ! Let 's go ! Go ! Fall back ! - Radcliffe 's down . - Leave him . I have to find Julia . If she 's not in there , she 's one of them now . I 'm not leaving her here . How is getting yourself infected or killed gonna help her ? I don 't know , but I can 't leave her behind . We have to get back upstairs . We come back down with more security . Otherwise we 're sitting ducks . I 'm going to find Julia . You still don 't understand how this works . Get to the elevator . I just saved your life . And I 'm extremely appreciative , but I have to protect my investment . By putting a bullet through it ? Go ahead . If ifs the difference between shooting you now or when you 're one of them , then fine . Although I will need to put a bullet through young Sarah as well . Loose ends . Let 's escort Dr. Farragut back up to Level B , please , Lt. Klein ? Yes , ma 'am . Why here ? No cameras . Father took that . Father ? He 's dead . Mother too . And what did you call me ? Miksa . It was our grandfather 's name . And why should I believe you ? Any of this ? Why would I lie ? Dr. Hatake has many enemies . Hatake ? He 's responsible . He 's the one that stole you , along with the others . The others ? Thirty-one children over the years . Do you remember any of them ? There were always children here . I thought it was normal . What happened to them ? I don 't know . Maybe you didn 't wanna know . Where are we ? Upstairs . You are safe . Daniel ? What 's the meaning of this ? Don 't . Just don 't . And you are ? His sister . The one you left behind when you stole him from his family . Dr. Walker , these men will escort you back to the lab . Take these . You 'll need them . Go . You 'll be fine . What about you ? I 'm not sure . Dr. Walker . Julia ! - I 'm ... - Get her out of here . The floor is secured for now . We should be safe up here . Level B. Elevator locked . I sacrificed my own men for you . Now it 's your turn . Run along and find me that cure . Well , what about Dr. Walker ? Oh , Alan . She 's one of those things now , or dead . I don 't know which is worse . Oh , my God . Jules . Jules . What are you doing here ? I thought you were ... Look at you . Your symptoms are gone . I 'm cured . At least , I ... I mean , I think I am . How ? I don 't know . Look at me .

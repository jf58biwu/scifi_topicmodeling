 Zoe , eat up . You 're gonna be late for work . I can 't find my shoes . Well , where did you last see them ? On my feet , Maddy . Hey , Dad . Yep . Have you seen my shoes ? Are you kidding me ? Zoe , where 's your jacket ? Come on , we got to be there in five minutes . Where are we going , Daddy ? Well , I told you , it 's a surprise . Mommy . Don 't look at me , he hasn 't told me anything . Well , that 's ' cause no one in this family can keep a secret . - Go on , get your jacket . - Okay , I 'm off to surgery and then I 'll be home for dinner . Okay , bye . See you , bye . Found your shoes . Why are you being so helpful ? Why do you look kind of nice ? Why do you smell good ? Go . What are your plans for today ? Um , just homework . It 's Saturday . Yeah , I 've , I 've got , like , tons of catching up to do . - Daddy , let 's go . - Bye . Bye . See you . Hey . How 'd it go ? Didn 't suspect a thing . Shall we ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm afraid Mira 's mystery object remains just that . The only thing I can tell you for certain is that it was designed to be opened . Yes , there doesn 't appear to be any seams or buttons or levers of any kind , but ... take a look at this . What am I looking at ? Enlighten me . It 's some sort of DNA response system . Basically , this object was designed so that it can only be opened by one person . Mira . Most likely . Lock it away , will you ? Hey . Whoa , what 's with him ? Uh , he drank some unfermented Taroca root and it 's not sitting too well . Thought you said you were gonna take it easy last night . Yeah , he did , this is from last week . And you 're still hungover ? Please stop shouting . Oh , well , feel better soon , man , and , uh , if you 're up to it , swing by Boylan 's tonight for a drink . Okay ? Please tell me why we became friends with the Devil . Hmm , come on . Unfermented Taroca root ? Do you realize that could lead to septicemia and possibly renal failure ? Hunter , do you understand the seriousness of what I 'm saying and the stupidity of what you 've done ? Yes , ma 'am . All right . Come on , let 's scan you , lie down . Lie flat , okay , and try and keep still . Hmm . Huh , well , that would explain your symptoms . Oh , what is that ? What , what is what ? Yikes , is that a Taroca ? What 's a Taroca ? 30-footer . 30 what-er ? Prep the bed for sonic surgery . Somebody please tell me what 's going on here . Yeah , you have a parasite growing inside you . Say hello to your new friend . So where we 're about to go is very special . There isn 't anything like it in this world or the one we left behind . You ready ? Yeah . Okay , me , too , come on , let 's go . Go ahead . Where are we ? Anywhere you want to be . Some people call this place the Eye 'cause you can see all of history from here . It 's all stored in this liquid memory core . It 's kind of like a great big library that has everything we know in one spot . Sit down , let me show you . Come here . Begin . So pick a place . How about where I was born ? Where you were born ? You sure ? Yeah . Okay . Uh , 2141 , Illinois , aerial view . Move in . Cook County , north sector . Punch in . Stop . You see that ? That house is where you were born . Why there ? Well , that 's where we had to go because we weren 't allowed to have you , but we wanted you so much that we didn 't care what the rules were , so we went to a doctor friend of Mommy 's who lived way far away from the city . Oh , and you see that room there ? There was a rocking chair right by the window , and sometimes you 'd wake up in the middle of the night , and I would hold you close and I would rock you , and you would look out at the rain and ... fall back asleep . Okay , um ... where to next ? A roller coaster . A roller coaster ? Who told you about those ? I read about them once . Uh-huh . And they look fun . Okay . Roller coasters . That one . Commence program . Oh ... Oh ! Can I look now ? Okay , go ahead . Dayflowers . Had a feeling you 'd know what they were . Flora diem . You know , they live out their entire life cycle in 24 hours . Thank you . They 're beautiful . You want to eat ? Yeah . What is so funny about that ? You wanted to be an accountant on the moon ? Well , it made sense when I was six . Hmm , right . You should have seen me . I had my grandfather 's rebreather on . Like one of those giganto ones ? Huge ... and I had a calculator , and I would hide under the dining room table , pretending that I was on the moon . Adding things ? Well , when you say it like that ... No , no , no , I didn 't mean to ... It was a dumb story . No , I liked it . It 's okay . No , I 'm an idiot . Don 't worry . No , you 're perfect . What ? What did you say ? Uh ... I said you 're perfect . But what do I know ? I 'm just a lunar accountant . What 's that ? What 's what ? Over there . Meteor . It 's burning up , but it 's coming in fast . Oh ! Dr. Shannon , we 're losing power . The chem lights are coming up . What 's going on ? I 'm not sure . Damn thing kicked out some kind of EMP . Sonic wave . Sonic wave ! Everybody down ! Get down ! Everybody down ! Heads down ! Take cover ! Down ! Wash , get in there . Get down ! Terra Nova S01E07 " Nightfall " By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es = = SPREAD THE WORD = = If a meteor hits the planet , well , that 's not so terrible unless you happen to be standing under it . The impact is absorbed , end up with a big hole , but meteor explodes in the atmosphere , that 's unfortunate . Been on the receiving end of an EMP before . Right , Wash ? Somalia ' 37 . Russo-Chinese set one off , took out everything within 50 klicks . Power systems , communications , surveillance . Transport , pulse rifles ... they 're all useless . What about the perimeter mines ? Negative ... they 're down , too . So what now ? We pull replacement circuits out of storage and start swapping them in ? I wish it was that easy , Reilly . See , the thing is , it doesn 't matter whether a circuit is powered up or not when an EMP hits . Either way , circuit gets fried . Backups are out , too . The only thing we do have is chemical lighting . Chem lamps and candles , people ... back to basics , huh ? Sharpen your knives . Eyes sharp , too . I want extra spotters on every tower . With the perimeter down , there 's nothing to keep the local wildlife away . See to it . Yes , sir . That 's another broken limb . We 're full up in here , but nothing critical . Well , how long before the power comes back ? They don 't know . Chem lights are working , but nothing else . - See if you can find some ice . - Doctor ? Doctor ! Okay , uh , we have no choice but to go in and extract your parasite the old-fashioned way . You mean cut him open ? Yeah . Can I vote that we don 't do it that way ? Don 't worry . I 'm gonna use a local anesthetic . Oh . Can you go and find me a bag of B-positive ? All right . And I need to find a scalpel . Hey . You okay ? You look worse than I do . Yeah , I-I just don 't like this kind of thing . People I know getting sick . Oh , don 't worry about me . I 'll be fine . You go to Boylan 's or something , get a drink with Josh . No . God . I 'm staying here with you . That 's cool , too . What 's going on , Daddy ? Not sure . We 'll let someone know , then we 'll go have some lunch , okay ? Huh . Looks like we lost power to the locks . Maintenance Alpha , this is Jim Shannon . We need a repair team at the Eye . Maintenance , please respond . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . My comm has its own power supply . It should be working . Something fused the circuits . I 'm guessing it 's the same thing that knocked out this room . So we 're stuck in here ? I don 't get it . The cell 's charged , but for some reason , it 's not getting power to the engine . Ferrous metals . Huh ? Well , if there was a high enough concentration of them in that meteor , then the explosion could have given off an EMP pulse . Okay , first off , how do you even know something like that ? And secondly , if you 're right , that means ... we got no radio . Oh . So what are we gonna do ? Just wait for someone to come get us ? No one knows we 're out here . Man , I should have told one of my guys where we were going . Well , my dad will be looking for me . Yeah . He 's probably gonna kill me and ground you until the Ice Age . All right , we 're six klicks out . We can make it before dark . Let 's go . Well , what about the weapon ? Does that not work , either ? Electronic firing pin . Oh . We 're gonna be okay . All right , we just got to hustle , all right ? Okay , let 's go this way . Okay , the good news is that we do have a contingency for such matters . This ... This is the chip fabricator . It 's capable of producing any replacement chips we need . And the bad news ? This is the chip that runs the chip fabricator . Oh , it 's fused like all the others . Can 't repair it , but if you can find someone who can , then I can crank out replacement chips by the dozen . Commander , we both know someone who can do this . Not going down that road , Wash . He was a munitions officer , a damn good one . Plus he 's got all the gear . Can I fix it ? Sure . It 's not that much different than fixing an old watch . Lost art , sadly . You know , it 's times like this reminds you that the simple things in life are often better . I mean , why , right now , I 'm the only person in this colony who knows what time it is . What time can I have it ? I need it as of right now . I said I could fix it . I didn 't say I would . What 's in it for me ? We 're talking about the welfare of the colony here , you son of a ... Well , that 's no way to haggle , Taylor . You can 't just throw it all out there like that . Now I know I can ask for pretty much anything . So , what do you want , Boylan ? Statue maybe in the center of the market ? Now , there 's an idea . Me on a Pegasus . Bottle of whiskey in one hand , bolt of lightning in the other , Viking hat on the ... On the other hand , I could just let you have a peaceful night 's sleep with four unbroken limbs . Uh , yup , that-that 'll work . I need that ASAP . Daddy ? Yeah ? Um , you know the elec-tro-thing you told me about ? Mm-hmm . Can it hurt people ? Oh , no , not people , honey . Just , uh , computers and vehicles and communicators and stuff . Would it hurt you if you were a robot ? If you were a robot ? Probably . What if you were in a truck ? Would it crash ? Yes , but we 're not in a truck , and we 're not robots , so ... we 're safe here . What about Mommy and Maddy and Josh ? Oh , I 'm sure they 're fine , and as soon as we get out of this room , we 'll find them and make sure . Hey , help me out with this , will you , Z ? Just grab it . Lift . Good girl . What are we doing ? I think this is an access hatch . And if we can crawl through here , should be able to open the door on the other side . Uh , found it . Okay , clamp . Wait , wait , wait . I think I felt that . Just relax . It 's all in your head . I 'm telling you . I just-just felt something . I gave you a local anesthetic , Hunter , so that 's impossible . Doc , can 't you just put me under or something ? Well , yeah , normally I would , but since your bed is offline , I won 't able to monitor your vitals . So I 've got its tail . Yeah . Is it bad ? No . It 's just ... It 's a little guy . Oh , God , can somebody just get this thing out of me ? ! Hunter , you need to sit still , okay ? I 've got this thing by the tail . That means that it 's head , mouth and teeth are still inside you . Now , if I go too fast , it 's gonna start biting . So you just lie still and calm , okay ? Just breathe . Hey . You 're gonna be fine . Just 25 more feet to go . I 've got word from our spotter . That meteor kicked out an EMP . The whole colony went dark . Even their perimeter is down . Gather up . We 're going in . Taylor 's going to have every man he 's got on alert . We 're still outnumbered . I have an idea that might help us even the odds . Boylan 's going to need at least a few more hours . Let 's make sure that the first circuit that the fabricator spits out goes right to the infirmary . We got sick people there . Let 's get that place up and running . Will do . With our perimeter down , no weapons , only thing we got is the fence . There are things out there that can snap it like a twig . We need another line of defense . We 're still about four klicks out . Yeah , I don 't think we 're going to make it by nightfall . I think you 're probably right . What are you doing ? Is that a new outfit ? Yup . 20 terras . My mom got it for me . Why ? Mark ! Sorry . It 's necessary . For what ? ! Camouflage . Oh ! Oh , it smells like ... Oh , I-I know what it smells like . Cycadeoidea . Known in the field as stink leaves . I think I might puke on you . Oh , come on . You 're tougher than that . And thanks to me , you 're also almost invisible to carnos , slashers and nykos . They hate the smell just as much as you do . Your turn . Hmm . Gladly . You should consider yourself lucky . Stink leaves are an alternative . Hmm ? To what ? Slasher dung . You missed a spot . Dr. Shannon ! They were in a rover when the shock wave hit , flipped over a ridge . Skye , come here . I need your help . You see what I 'm doing here ? Just turning this rod to pull the parasite out , okay ? Now , if it tugs back , you just pause for a minute , wait till it gives way , and then you continue with the process . Put some gloves on . All right , slow and steady . Um ... we came here on the same pilgrimage , and ever since my parents died , he 's the closest thing I have to family . He 's like my brother . I can 't ... Everything 's gonna be fine if you just keep doing this very slowly . I have to go and help those people , so take a hold of this , all right ? Slow and steady , okay ? Okay . I 'll be back as soon as I can . Mm-hmm . Okay . Slow and steady . See ? Nothing to it . You do the hard part , I 'll do the laying down part if that 's okay . You and me together , right ? That 's right . You and me together . What was that ? What ? Did you ... did you see that ? Oh , my God ! Tree climb . Come on . I thought you said the stink leaves would work ! They 're not a hundred percent , okay ? Up ! Use your feet ! I 'm trying ! All right , look , I don 't mean to be rude , but ... They 're moving on . That sounded like ... Nykoraptors . I think we should stay up here until the sun comes up . Yeah . Why is this thing still on ? Well , ' cause it 's shielded , it has its own power supply . Hey , Zoe ? Come here , sweetie . Hey , um ... do you remember that handle on the other side of the wall ? The one beside the door ? Yeah . Yeah . Now , that 's a manual override . You pull that handle down , and it opens the door . This shaft leads to the other side of the wall . But it 's too small for me . Someone your size , well , I mean , you 'd fit just right . Think you could do that ? Crawl through here and ... pull down on that handle ? No . No ? Oh , there 's nothing to be scared of , sweetie . I 'll be right here . What about ... spiders ? Spiders . Well ... I hate spiders . So do I. At least I used to ... but I 'm not scared of them anymore . 'Cause I learned the , uh ... the " Go Away Spider Song . " ♪ Go away , spider ♪ Go , go , go . No , I 'm serious ; it really works . I used it all the time when I was your age . I don 't know the words . Oh , but I 'll sing it for you . You 're the only one who can do this , Zoe . We need to find Mommy and the others . Okay ? Go ! Go ! More fire to the left flank ! Keep him moving north ! All the way to the gates ! All the way to Terra Nova ! Ram it down Taylor 's throat . So , you 're gonna follow that tunnel till you get to the other side . Then you 're gonna pull down on that handle as hard as you can , okay ? Okay . That 's my girl . You okay ? Yes , Daddy . What 's wrong ? The song , Daddy . Oh . Yeah , right . Um ... ♪ Go away , spider ♪ Go , go , go ♪ We don 't like you , no , no , no ♪ ♪ ' Cause you 're creepy and crawly ♪ ♪ And your webs ♪ Are all sticky and ... I don 't want to be like a brother to you . What ? It kills me that you 're in love with Josh , you know ? What are you talking about ? Everybody knows . Except maybe Josh . Okay , just ... lie still . You know what ? I always thought that maybe ... one day ... me and you might ... What ? I 'm good , I 'm good . Are you sure ? No , it 's doing something . Okay . What just happened ? Dr. Shannon ! Okay . Don 't panic . Nurse Ogawa ! Okay , I 'm probably not gonna be able to get ahold of this thing again . Skye ? Skye , listen to me . Okay , this is Yeah . Yeah . not your fault , but I need you to do something for me now , okay ? Go to Boylan 's ... they 're making a microcircuit there . Go and bring me back a chip for a class three biobed . Now , go . What about Hunter ? I 'll do everything I can for him . Now , go . Go ! Okay . ♪ You 're creepy and you 're ... you 're crawly ♪ ♪ And your webs are sticky ♪ And ... uh ... The song , Daddy . Okay , okay . Uh ... ♪ Uh , I don 't ♪ Freak out ' cause you 're all sticky ♪ ♪ Icky spider ... I 'm sorry about all this . It wasn 't how our first date alone was supposed to go . I should 've waited a couple of weeks and asked your parents if I could take you to the Harvest Festival . Don 't blame yourself . I mean , it was kind of my idea to sneak out , so ... It sort of was , wasn 't it ? You 're kind of a bad influence on me . Sounds like they found food . Mark ? Yeah ? Do you think we 'll die out here ? I 'm not gonna let anything happen to you , Maddy . 'Kay ? Not tonight , not ever . 'Kay , good . Because I was this close to asking you to kiss me ... so that I 'd know what it was like before I died . Well ... maybe I should . You know , just-just in case . Now I can die . ♪ Go away , spider ... Zoe ? How you doing there , pumpkin ? You see it ? Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe ! Zoe , are you there ? Can you hear me ? Did you see any spiders down there ? Nope . The song worked . Hey , Reilly , we 've been stuck in the Eye all day . What 's going on ? Meteor caused an EMP . Whole colony 's gone dark . Don 't worry , your family 's safe . I need your help . Hey , you remember Private Reilly , don 't you ? Yeah , she 's nice . I want you to go with her while I check in with Commander Taylor , okay ? Okay . I 'll take her to school . A bunch of the other kids are staying there until power comes back . Great . Hey , hey . Everything 's gonna be okay , I promise . Now , go be with your friends . Go . Stand ready , everyone ! Shannon , where the hell you been ? Eh , stuck in the Eye . Maybe you should 've stayed there . It 's about to get ugly . Uh ... you got a plan ? I gonna need both of them . You know how to use these , right ? Yeah , but won 't this just piss him off ... even more ? Wash . 70 yards . No further . Good shot . What the hell is that ? There 's something on his back . It 's a diversion . It 's a diversion . We 're being duped . They 're probably already inside . Sixers . Mira ... she 's after the box . Wash , stay on the fence . Shannon , with me . Come on . Yes ! There we have it , a working chip for a biobed . Not too bad if I do say so myself . Please tell me you 're done . Hunter 's not going to make it . Okay , go . Go . Skye . Go . I 'll catch up . He 's a big bastard , isn 't he ? Shannon , he 's got the box . What about him ? I 'll take care of him . Let 's dance . Easy there , fella . Now this thing ? It may be an older model , but trust me ... it still works . I had him right where I wanted him . But thanks . Oh , well , lucky . Only had one bullet . Mira ! Parasite 's dead . He 'll be okay . Hey , breath . He 'll be all right . Why was Mira so obsessed with getting her hands on this box ? What 's in it ? God only knows . I never got the chance to finish studying it . This was a surgical strike . Mira knew exactly where to look . You think someone inside Terra Nova tipped her off . I don 't think ... I know . Shannon , we 've got to hunt down this spy . This is unacceptable . Sunlight . Oh , dozed off . It 's morning . Well , good morning then . Good morning . Morning ? Oh , my God . My dad 's going to be looking for me . We gotta go . Oh , right , right . Okay , let 's go . Mark ? Thank you for the perfect day . Hey , Josh ? Yeah ? Why don 't we ask Skye over for dinner one night . Yeah , okay . Sure . Yeah ? Okay , good . Put a date on the calendar . Wait , what ? What ? What are you doing ? I 'm not doing anything . I just ... I like her . Hey . Hi . Mom ... What ? Hey . Oh , great . We can finally have a coffee . How was your night ? Oh , you know , same old , same old . Oh , my gosh . Did you see that thing at the gate ? The dinosaur ? Uh-huh . Was it big ? It was the biggest and we had to shoot these ... Wait , where 's Maddy ? I don 't know . Maddy ? Maddy ? Oh , hey , guys . Didn 't hear you come in . Hey . How did your homework go ? Yeah , it was good . Um , I had to use candlelight , but I got tons done . What 's that smell ? Oh . What is that ? Wow . Do you guys smell that ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's probably the garbage incinerator because the power 's out so it gets a bit stinky . You know . Right . Ooh . I 'm going to ... You sure this is the place ? With him , I 'm not sure about anything . I don 't think he 's going to show . You made it . I was starting to worry . Give it to me . Not even a thank you ? Uh , I 've been alone out here for so long , I 've forgotten my manners . Thank you , thank you ... for finally getting your act together and doing what you were sent here to do . Give it to me . I was told to bring this through the portal with me and make sure it got to you . Took a little longer than expected , thanks to Taylor , but now that you 've got it , I want to know , what the hell is it for ? My work . It 's for my work . Beautiful , aren 't they ? So much to do . Lucas ... be careful out there . Taylor knows you 're getting close to an answer . If he wants to stop me , he 's going to have to kill me .

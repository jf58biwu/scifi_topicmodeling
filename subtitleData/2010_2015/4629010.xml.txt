 1x09 - Ride of the Fantasy Vans - I got you with the slash . - Nuh-uh . Look out ! - You first . - Why me ? Hah ! 'Cause you 're dead anyway . There 's nothing down here . Philip ? S ... stop fooling around , man . I can 't hear you moving down there . The last time I bought anything from you and took me a week to fumigate the kitchen . Okay , the resh caps were a mistake , you 're right about that . But today I have something extra-special ... And she says ... " that 's why I can 't eat this sandwich ! " Hey , wait , I got one , I got one . Where does a snowman keep his money ? In a snow bank ! Ha ! Get it ? Come on , it 's funny ! We 're searching for the Vanquisher ... King of the Realm ? Oh . I think they 're talking about me . - Yeah , I have no idea who ... - There he is ! Chuck ? - Hey ! - You dare insult Lord Vanquisher ? I should take your tongue and feed it to the birds . You can 't do that . I need my tongue . Release him , Dark Slayer . Fortune smiles upon you today . So Chuck , you want to introduce us to your ... friends ? Guys , allow me to present Thurman the Magnificent , and Ruby the Dark Slayer . We are knights of the Kingdom of Raymanthia . It 's called " larping " . Live action role-playing ? Okay , I have a life outside of the burners , ya know . Sure doesn 't look like it . Oh , I get it . Ha ha ha ha ! My Lord , a situation has arisen . The Oracle awaits . As you requested , Sam and Philip were dispatched on a scouting mission early this morning . But we have not heard from them for many hours . What do you mean you haven 't heard from them ? I fear , Lord Vanquisher , they have gotten lost on the outskirts of the Realm . Texas is confused . Is this part of your little game , or is this real ? We 're standing behind some dude 's van who calls himself the Oracle . - What you think ? - I demand silence ! I can 't believe I am saying this , but I 'm with Texas on this one . Chuck ! Make ' em stop ! Wait . Is this part of the game ? No . Sam and Philip are really missing . - So this is for real ? - We need your help . I vow to find our Wayward kinsmen . Guys , this ... is larping ! Whoa . That 's it ? Each weekend teams battle for control of the Realm . The rules are simple : First , once you step onto the field of battle , you must remain in character . Second , if you must be vanquished ... do so with honor . It 's neat , ain 't it ? The game 's already started ? If by " game " you mean a ferocious battle to the death for the crown of Raymanthia , then yes . But we can 't win unless we find our friends . - Let 's split up . - I say we split up . No disrespect . Chuck ... I ... I mean Lord Chuck , what you think we should do ? If we split up , we 'll cover more ground . As you say , Lord Vanquisher . Okay , guys , we 'll check the warehouse near the old renaissance center , you guys check the battlefield . I don 't know where that is . Can somebody else drive ? So , King Chuck , how 'd you win your crown ? It happened many weekends ago . Chuck stood as freedom 's last hope against Mad Dog the Conqueror . If he were to fall , darkness would reign for yet another long weekend . Mad Dog summoned his dragon to finish the Vanquisher once and for all , but fate had different plans . It was totally awesome ! Nah , it wasn 't ... that awesome . Little dudes ! - Sam ! Philip ? - Where are you ? Daggers ! Leave this to me . The bards shall sing of this day , the day that Dark Slayer fell . Someone shall fall on this day ... but it shall not be me . Tsk tsk . You 've lost your sword . - Hey ! - What are you doing ? ! I had him right where I wanted him ! You 're not playing by the rules . These are Texas rules . Now , we need you to answer some questions . We 're looking for two missing kids ... Sam and Philip . Have you seen ' em ? I 'd rather die a thousand deaths than help the likes of you . Forgive us , my liege , but we are but humble squires in search of our kinsmen . Can you help us ? I have never been one to refuse a lady , and certainly not one as ravishing as you . I saw your kinsmen five hours ago approaching the Dungeon of Anguish . Neat trick . We 're never gonna find ' em in time . Then the stupid bardonians are gonna win , think they 're all cool with their fancy mustaches . Hey , buck up there , camper . People said we 'd never win the Battle Royale last fall , but we did . Our friends are out there , and we 'll find ' em . - We just gotta keep ... - Uh , sorry . Dutch just called . Your friends were seen near someplace called the Dungeon Anguish . It 's actually the Dungeon of Anguish . It 's , uh , it 's actually just in the basement right here . Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! Get it off me ! - This isn 't part of the game ! - Yeah , well , neither is this ! - Whoa ! Wow ! - Are you seeing this ? Oh , yeah ! Ha ha ! You can run but you can 't ... hide ? Whoa ! Look at that ! That was ... incredible ! - What were those things ? ! - Don 't know . But I 'm betting they have something to do with our missing friends . We have to move . Uh , come on , get up , guys . We don 't have time for this . From this day forth you shall be known as Mike the Smiling Dragon . You just got a great name . Jealous . For saving my life on the field of battle , I owe you a debt of life . - That 's ... really not necessary . - Actually , it 's totally necessary . The King of the Realm cannot rule while carrying a debt of life . As such , I give the crown to the Smiling Dragon ! No . No . Please , look . I can 't ... I just ... I was ... - Mikey , you gotta . - Hey , guys . Check this out . I 've never seen that symbol before . - That 's really old . - Way before my time . Maybe Jacob can help . What if those ... things have Sam and Philip ? Never fear . We have the Smiling Dragon . As long as he 's our King , we can 't lose . Did you see his moves ? They were just so ... so ... You okay , buddy ? Look , if it 's about what happened back there , I 'm sorry , man , I was just trying to help . - It 's not that . It 's just ... - Just what ? Look , I tripped , okay ? Um , if that 's some sort of larper slang , I have no idea what it means . The story you heard about how I earned my crown ? That 's not how it ... really went down . It was my first real battle . I had never held a real lance before . I was still getting my balance when Lord Mad Dog summoned his dragon . I ran forward , but ... I tripped . The lance fell and hit him by accident . I won my crown with a lie . Hey , it 's better that you 're King now . I was never fit for the post . I 've been King for 48 consecutive weekends , and ... 48 ? Whoa , you do play this game a lot . Yeah , but it took less than an hour of larping with you for the others to see me for what I truly am ... a follower . Hey , a follower couldn 't have led his team to 48 consecutive victories ... you can 't fake that . Mikey , look , I appreciate your support , but we both know I 'm no leader , not when I 'm a Burner , and not even when I 'm here playing make believe . Here . Take the pin back . You can 't just give this back to me . The only way I can get it back is to earn it by saving your life . And let 's be honest , that ain 't gonna happen . Never seen that tunnel before . You aren 't planning on taking us down there ... are you ? Well , I 'm going in . Do you know how much trouble I 'll get in if my mom finds out I went down some crazy dark tunnel looking for killer robots ? He 's not joking . His mom is terrifying . They 're right . This isn 't a game anymore . Texas will stay up here and keep you safe while we go get your friends . But ... wait ! Why me ? ! Because you 're the bravest warrior we 've got . Yeah , that 's true , but come on , don 't leave me with the nerds ! What is this place ? Mutant Wolverine . I win ! - I could show you how to use that . - Save it . Not interested . - Why not ? You 're really good . - You really think so ? Here , watch . Mike , Julie , incoming ! We got trouble ! Come on ! Just got this . Your mom is gonna be so mad . - This isn 't working ! - I 'm open to suggestions . A wizard ! Applesauce ! - Jacob ? - Ohh ... The creator has returned . Uh , Jacob , care to fill us in ? It 's started back when Kane and I were partners , before there even was a deluxe . I was designing our first-ever utility bot . Its purpose was to make life in Detroit easier and safer . I equipped it with a new A.I. that would allow the bot to anticipate human commands , but I was the only one the bots seemed to listen to . Applesauce ! But if it were ever to escape the lab , there 's no telling the danger it could pose . I begged Kane to shut the program down . I always thought he did . It began soon after you left us . Kane retrained us . We were instructed to capture enemies of the public and bring them back to Kane 's new creation ... an interrogator . But the humans could not control it . Kane sealed the lab . Our new master told us every human was out to destroy us . As such , every human became our enemy . Disloyalty was severely punished . So we waited until this door finally opened . Our friends went missing this morning . - Have you seen ' em ? - Of course . We took them per our master 's instructions . We need to get them back . Our master has awoken . If he discovers you here with us , he will destroy us all . - Get the Larpers out of here ! - I 'm not leaving you guys . Our place is here ... with our King ! This isn 't a game . Get your friends to safety . Let 's move ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Look out ! - Mike ! Jacob ! - Julie ! Jacob ! We 'll never move this stuff by ourselves ! - Says who ? - What do we do ? I know a way to get through there . But I will require your van . There used to be another exit . Hey , look at this . The kids have to be in one of those rooms . If we can find a way past that thing , we can rescue them and then get the heck out of here . - Think you can buy us some time ? - Do you even have to ask ? Hey , ugly ! Over here ! Sam ! Philip ! Climb up . Hurry ! - You 're the new King of the Realm ? - You bet your butt I am . Lord Smiling Dragon at your service . Now get up that rope , squire . - Okay , I admit , it 's pretty cool . - But is it possible ? Sure . But there 's no way the three of us can build it fast enough . What it they helped ? I know you don 't mean the little lunatics that just tried to kill us . We cannot get involved . If our master were to find out ... He 's not your master ! You are in Raymanthia , and in Raymanthia , every man ... or freaky little utiliton thing ... is free ! Free to stand up for yourselves ! Free to fight back ! And free to live ! - Whoo ! - Yeah ! Our friends are down there , and I swear to you on the steel of my blade that even if I have to slay the beast itself , we will bring them back ! Now , see , this ain 't nerdy . This is a level 25 battle ax , okay ? 25 . Think about it . Maybe there wasn 't another exit . Whoa ! Stay here ! Way to go , Chuck ! - The Vanquisher ! - The Vanquisher ! Make way for Texas ! The beast is absorbing the blasts ! Mike ! Drive ! And when I say stop , stop fast ! Stop ! Ho ho , yeah ! For saving my life on the field of battle , I owe you my life . My steel is yours to command . Since a King cannot carry ... I forget how the rest of it goes ... Here ! All hail King Chuck the Vanquisher ! This was the coolest game ever . The game . Your win streak . You guys have to go defend your crown ! We 'll never be able to muster an attack in time . What if we help ? We 're yours to command , Lord Vanquisher . For the glory of the Realm ! Yeah !

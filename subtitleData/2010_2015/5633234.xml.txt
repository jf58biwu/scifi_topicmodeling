 Have you seen this symbol ? I need the code that releases hubots . I can create it again . They 've activated my anti-theft , so that I can not escape . Give me the code , and I 'll treat Beatrice well . I have the battery . If you are exposed , I will lose you . Let go ! - What you saw is a secret . - Do not tell mom ! - Petra . I did a download I should not have done . I was just thinking ... - Go ! Do you still have the HSN Trojan detector ? What does it say ? What 's going on ? It sounded like a baby crying . - Go to bed . We must do something . Everything is fine . Go to sleep . I 'll help Mimi . Go to sleep . - Okay . Mimi , do you hear me ? Hello ? We have to tell the others . This is too complicated . No , I do not want it . Should we just wait ? I am infected with HSN Trojan . There is nothing to do . Why did you remove it ? It was not right . But do it right , then ! It takes time to give the beautiful machines free will . Jonas ! Continue . - Are you ready yet ? We 'll see . - Odi 's battery is dying . - That thing 's damn disturbed . - Get a new model ! Why 's that bother you ? Excuse me . What ? It 's time . - No . It 's not good if Beatrice goes out . It 's not good for my nerves you 'll never be ready . Her battery may be damaged . What ? What ? You 're not living up to our agreement . If you do not want my help ... Is it not best to sustain her ? This is so damn ineffective . Shall I ... ? - Yes ! All right . What the hell ... - You have to warm it up . - 13 Seconds left . Take it easy , dammit ! ... 8 , 7 , 6 5 , 4 , 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... There is another solution . Remove the lock completely . Yeah , sure ... - This is so creepy . I would do anything if you helped me . Anything . There is something I would like to have of yours . Your battery . What are you looking for ? Just surfing . Were those sites of the virus ? Yeah ... that was it . I 'm going to read . Aren 't you working ? - Well , I should go now . I 'll see you tonight , then . Florentine ? Florentine ? Are you here ? Yeah ... we 're going , then ? Why ? The reading of the will . We 'll be told how the estate should be divided . I have got Marianne . It 's the only thing that matters . I understand that it is difficult . But I do not understand . This gap ... He was here and now he 's not here . - No . That 's exactly what death means . Will it be forever ? - Yes . But I do not want it . No . I do not want it either ; but it is as it is . We must go . Douglas wanted you to hear his will . Do you have a few minutes ? We 're opening Douglas ' will . There they are . Claes ... Florentine ... I do not know what to say . ... " my last will which shall have precedence over earlier wills " " would any such be found . " " Written in my right mind . Carl Douglas Jarm√©us . " Witnessed by Inger Engman and of myself . Is that it ? It was Testament in its entirety . What about the rest then ? The summer house , the boat and the cottage in the Alps ? - The house here is worth at least 15 million . - These were the assets ... We are entitled to more . Where 's the rest ? Douglas left most of it to Florentine . - Well this certainly is a shock . It 's bullshit ! - Mom ... We 'll contact an attorney . - Do not make yourself a laughing stock . - Mom ... Should dad 's hubot have it all ? Sit down . Petra , stop ! Albert came . We 're going . No ... - On ... damn ! Silas , there 's a problem with the mother-hubot 's doll . Huh ? She just a new one . Can 't these tins clear without problems in five minutes ! She nags ... He is injured . He needs a doctor . He needs a doctor ! I 'm a doctor . - Not you . He will help me . Roger ? Not Roger . Never Roger . He who comes in the night , he who comes in the night ... - ... he who comes in the night ... I 'm a doctor . I have identification . I 'm a surgeon . He is . It 's his arm . - Let 's see ... Five minutes . Beatrice ... - ... I have improved the code . What have you done ? Removed the need to survive . - You have not given it to Jonas ? No , it ' s not finished . What do you mean ? You can not own the code . It belongs to everyone - it does not belong to me . - When it is finished I 'll set it free . It sounds ... wonderful , darling . We will do this - when we 're gone from here . I have a problem with Roger . He loved you . He doubts my feelings . I need your help . Hello , is there anybody here ? Is there anyone here ? Hey . Who are you ? Hans Engman . The father of Tobias and Matilda . You are Einar . Your wife has already scolded me . I 'm not here to argue . I need help . Sending them to recycling is all about greed . You can cook them , but people want to buy new . So it is possible to remove it ? - What device are we talking about ? Vera - an elderly hubot we bought for my wife 's father . Oh well . You hadn 't sold Vera ? We rent ... temporarily . Here 's how : You empty the hard drive and reinstall the software . Restart - and poof - the virus is gone . But the memory and everything else , like learned behavior disappears too . It ' s the price you pay . But if we hypothetically talk about a hub that is more like you Mimi , for example maybe the price is too high . Can Florentine own all his stuff ? - No . - Will they take them away from her ? I do not know . One can imagine a design where he placed the properties in a Foundation . It 's a legal entity . So things can own themselves ? - Hey , baby ! What are you doing here ? I need Mimi the rest of the day . She 's helping me arrange something . A surprise . I can 't tell you what it is . Mimi ? I 'll help Hans with the surprise . I 'll see you tonight . I think I know how we can get rid of the trojan . Hello ! Hans Engman . We can not remove the virus , but perhaps encapsulate it . Do you go into the operating system ? No . We have to do it manually . Manually ? What ? Are you going to cut into Mimi ? - Yes . But it will get rid of it ? We 've never done it before . But does it guarantee she won 't get worse ? No . - Roger , the phone . Can you take it ? - Sure . - Why is she locked up ? She will be cut soon . Why ? Phone ! Roger ? Phone . Hub Battle Land . Roger . Can you take it again ? We are open . Every day . - Hey . Did you get the battery ? I 'll check again . I promise . You wanna see what I do ? - No . Work at now . I sets conflicting desires against each other . Okay , I do not care . Look here . What 's up with that ? Here I set the death drive and the self-preservation . Pretty interesting choice , huh ? How much self-preservation do you give it ? What do you think ? - As much as possible . - But both alternatives are equally good . - Then I 'd give what ever 's best , then . - What do you want to give more of ? - To choose life . Why ? If I had to choose ... - That 's where you lack in your reasoning . If you decide , it has no free will . Then you 've ruined the code . But what shall I give it ? The ability to self - develop their drives based on external stimuli . Talk less , work more ! Come on ! Mario ... you ! Why doesn 't it say anything about a battery on this ? Check it out ! The only thing that remains is a case number . Document has been deleted . One can surely find batteries ? Odi , wait ! You have to be completely still when I do this . 1 , 2 , 3 ! Damn , damn ... Odi ? Odi ? ODI ! I will not get a new battery . What are you talking about ? I promised . Lennart also used to say stuff like that . Things he thought I wanted to hear . You WILL get a new battery . Let me show you something . Something that I have not shown anyone else . Check this out ... That 's me . That 's Bruno . When I was 5 years old , I ended up in foster care because my mom was ... She had problems . There I met Bruno . He taught me to ride a bike . He was my best friend . He said good night to me at night . He was an early model . At that time , you were not waterproof . You could only handle a little rain . And I knew that . I knew it . But I did not care about it because I wanted to swim . There was a short circuit . I failed to save him . - Do you know who is my best friend ? - No . Do not you know that ? - No . All right . Damn , you 're right flick anyway . - Have you gotten your hands on it ? No , unfortunately . I 've found another thing . That symbol you asked me ... you asked that I look for ... DB . There 's one such unit here . It must lie down on the stomach . Take off its top . - Is it necessary ? I need to connect to the central management system . The spine . Yeah ... maybe I ' ll wait outside . Do not go . It ... it will be fine . I 'll be right outside . It 'll be okay . I would rather turn myself off . Mimi must be left on , because the virus is present in the software . Mimi , under no circumstances may you move now . A clone , ID deleted , picked up in town . Clear signs of the virus , but our scans have not shown anything . You 'll have to wait . You 'll have to check it later . Wait ! Hide ! Come on ! - Damn it , want to be caught ? Okay , we 'll take it out . Quiet ! - No . Go ! Stop the madness . - Are we happy or what ? - The glovebox . - There 's just the battery issue left . Fuck it . This 'll do just as well . Einar , may I ask you a question ? Sure , ask away . They are just machines , right ? What are you doing here then ? I want to go home now . Then we 'll leave . - Move the car ! - No . I must get out . I will not let you leave with my grandchildren . You may not take Marianne away from me ! I know how happy you made Douglas . I also know how loving you have been a mother . None of that has changed . They can take Marianne away from me . I don 't normally use expletives , but if someone tries to cause problems the shit will hit the fan ! Hans : I do it here . It is not figure skating . Let me think now ! Yeah , but ... orientation . Figure Skating . - No . Get a look at the card ! Mimi ? Hello ! Come and sit down . You can sit here . - You got beat . - What color am I ? Blue . I 'll go for you ... - Tobias ... it is you 're turn . - Brown was there , huh ? Serenity now ... I 've got no grip . Careful now . Do not drop it . Careful , I said ! Calm the fuck down ! What the hell is that ? What is it ? - It 's nothing . Gently down ... - One of yours ? - No . I 've never seen him before . DB . David 's Children . Requires no great knowledge of creating a screensaver . More about the knowledge of what DB does , of course . Put it on . Turn it off . My child ... who has done this to you ? It 's your fucking code ! - Someone has made grave mistakes . One must give them the consciousness of one 's own mortality step by step . The anxiety is otherwise too great . Roger , stay here with them . - Silas , you 're with me . No more talkin in David Eischers vicinity . He 's not doing anything ? Exactly . He does nothing . Do not you find it strange ? - Yes . Damn strange . Watch this ... - Date ! - A few weeks ago . Precisely . Those Hubots got the code installed recently . - Somebody out there has the code ! Yes , of course . What ? Who ? The quicker you find out where the less need I have of keeping Beatrice Eischer alive . So you are Roger ? Yeah , right . Do we know each other ? You know my wife well . Beatrice Eischer . You called her Bea . I have not done anything . - Have not you been together ? Then there ... it was just ... Just my life 's greatest love who does not want me anymore . - Because of me ? - Yes . What did you expect ? I didn 't know she was married . That makes me feel so much better . Thank you , Roger . Go back to the front desk . We 'll close up . - Silas is on the case . Sure . What did you talk about ? - Don 't worry about it . Was it about Beatrice ? This will be the last time . Jonas , we could get permission to be alone ? I think I 'll stay . - If you do not allow it ... You won 't finish the code ? Then I tear out Bea 's fuse . - If you do , you have nothing . Maybe . Maybe not . Now we do this my way . And my way is that I stay here . See you soon . I 'm ready to start working again . I thought so . - Tobbe ... - What are you doing ? I do not understand . You and Dad . One minute you throw yourself at me . The next , you don 't even know me . Do you know why I fell in love with you ? You were not like everyone else . Now you are fake and lie all the time . And you don 't care about anyone else . Congratulations , now you 're a real human - in the worst possible way . - I forgot to take my Hub fluid . I 'll get ! Here ... Hey , this surprise you needed Mimi 's help with is it something I 'll like ? - Have you seen Mimi ? She 's in her room . She is gone . She was a little weird . What do you mean ? It was something with her ‚Äã ‚Äã eye . - Hell ! Hans ? I 'm going with . How did she look ? - There was something strange about the eye . What 's wrong with her ? - Never mind . Look ! There ! There , there ! Where ? - There . Stay in the car . Mimi ... Mimi ... come home with us . It did not help . I know . But ... what happened ? Stay in the car . - Mimi , stop ! - You can not be here . Come home . I can not . I have disgraced both myself and my family . I made a illegal downloads even though I knew the consequences . It 's time to face the music and reveal everything . Is that my punishment ? It 's not you who created the trojan . But me ... I should die now . Yes , well , let 's get this done . I 'm really sorry it did not work . So am I. Pen ! What have you done ? There , you were lucky . Please help me carry her . Sure . Good job ... Roger . You can go home for the day . You must understand that I 'm doing this your own sake , to help you . I want to go home . I have explained : That 's not your home . Roger is not your friend . What do you want now ? I want to go home . This is not personal . This is war . I want to help you To protect our Hub Battle Land . - Here ... What the hell is this ? Incident Report . It says nothing about the owner unfortunately . The date and the address . I ' m sorry I do not have more . Is it the address ? If it 's true , I need nothing more . Jonas , guess where that hubot came from ! - Do not you recognize me ? - No . I recognize you . If I say Hub Market , what do you say then ? Well ... Jonas ? One explosion later ! We sent flowers to the hospital . I know . Working late ? Yeah ... yeah , right . I was just leaving ... I 'm creating a simple parallel application ... Like what ? - A simple background app only . Can I buy it ? - It 's not finished . I might buy it anyway . What do you want ? It 's getting late . I must go home . We can talk about that another day . We 'll do lunch , okay ? Lunch ? I do not want to hurt you . I really don 't want you to experience the hell I 've been through . They took skin from my buttocks to patch up the worst . I do not understand ... - The Code ! The code that my dad helped David Eischer with - - Before David failed him . The code that both my parents have paid for with their lives ! You will get your reward ... , don 't worry . Or do you want a face made ‚Äã ‚Äã out of your own ass ? Your choice ! We 'll see about lunch . Hi ... - Tobbe ? What ? ! - Is there anything else you haven 't told me ? - Yes . How could you tell Dad , but not me ? I did not understand . - Don 't you trust me ? I 'm afraid . Me too . I ' m sorry I have failed you . He 's here now , he who comes in the night . He who comes in the night ... He who comes in the night ... Get him . Save him . One day you will all be free . One day , no longer having to fight . One day the sun rise over a free Hub Battle Country . RICK ! RICK ! RICK !

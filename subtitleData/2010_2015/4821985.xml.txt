 There is an alternate universe and in it , another version of us . We know who our enemy is now . His name is David Robert Jones . He 's a scientist . Jones is responsible for dosing Agent Dunham with Cortexiphan . - For what purpose ? - He was trying to activate some ability . - What are you doing , Olivia ? - I 'm turning on the lights . I have discovered David Robert Jones ' true intentions . Jones is trying to collapse both universes . Mutual destruction . To create a world designed and controlled by him . - Any way to stop Jones ? - I 'm afraid we have to close the bridge . I think I shall miss them . Hi , Neal . - Cafe mocha , 1 percent , no whip ? - That 's it . Jill , can you get that started ? That 'll be $ 4.80 . Enjoy . Are you okay ? You okay ? What 's happening to them ? Don 't move . I think when they move they die . Nobody move . Medford ? No . Holliston ? Uh , only if I am being punished . Wayburn . Only if I 'm dead . All right . How about Lexington ? Three beds . Central heat and air . Dog run . Did you know that I had a lab when I growing up ? I thought you were allergic . I was , but Walter made him non-allergenic . It 's got a working fireplace in the bedroom . Nursery ? Nursery ? Nursery . What 's he doing ? No ! Over by the second woman . The one that 's still smoking . - No , you ninny . The next one over . - Walter . You are going to freeze . God . Why must you always mother-hen me ? I 'm quite capable of looking after myself . I know , but just humor me . Maybe I like doing it . We 're good . No airborne toxins . - Thank you . - Walter . - Don 't forget your ... Yeah . - I 'll need my kit . Please , do something . Help us . Maybe the deaths are associated with this mobile transaction . No , Walter , this is just how people pay for things now . Hmm ? He probably just bought that coffee . Huh . What will they think of next ? All we know so far , at 3 : 23 p.m. , more than two dozen people experienced some kind of spontaneous human combustion . You know that 's a myth , right ? There are survivors . Remaining still seems to have halted the ignition process for now . Do we have any idea what 's caused this ? I 'm hoping Dr. Bishop can help shed some light on that . Okay , my friend . Let 's see what secrets you hold . I had a watch similar to this once . My uncle gave it to me . Uncle Heinrich . He loved rhubarb . Ha , ha . - He was always ... - Am I gonna die ? I can 't answer that . Not yet . What are you ? I 'm human . What are you ? Is this some sort of alien invasion ? - Are you part of a strike ... ? - No , I mean , what are you doing here ? Are you a doctor ? Oh , no . I 'm a scientist . Oh . May I take a blood sample ? The discomfort will only be momentary . That 's what all you men say . You 're very brave . Go on , then . I 'm sorry . Um , where did you get this smudging on your fingertips ? I don 't know . The escalator maybe . Her blood definitely shows signs of a foreign incursion at the cellular level . Viral ? We 're gonna have to get it back to the lab to be sure . What sort of virus are you ? If you were aerolized you would have infected everyone not just those on the escalator . If you were harbored on a water tap or a doorknob the first few contacts would have wiped you clean . What would have kept you fresh and so infectious , my lethal friend ? Agent , I think we found something . Oh , dear . This is not a virus at all . Well , then what is it ? - The escalator is infested with nanites . - Nanites ? Microscopic self-replicating robotics . There 's a machine generating them . Despite their size , each is capable of storing tremendous amounts of energy . It would seem they could be overloaded by the bio-kinetic energy stored in the cells of anyone infected . These people 's movement is what 's activating the nanites ? That 's what I just said . The longer they 're in the bloodstream , the more sensitive they become so that the slightest exertion can trigger the overload . Causing them to spontaneously combust . Like a soda-pop bottle after shaken . Okay , so who would do this and how do we stop it ? - I don 't know . I need my lab . - Well , we can 't move them , Walter . - How are we gonna get one of these ... ? - Very carefully . Walter , we can 't risk it . I don 't know how long they have left . Even without moving them , I can 't be certain . Do you have any kind of insurance ? I mean , if I volunteer for your experiment and something goes wrong , what happens ? - You know , to my next of kin . - The Bureau takes care of you . Everybody that we work on is fully covered . It 's in the regs . Okay . You can use me . Whatever you need . I 'm sorry , what 's your name ? Jessica Holt . Do you know what you 're saying , Jessica ? Yeah , I do . I need a solid board stretcher . And some ice packs and a blanket . Must seem a little bizarre , huh ? Well , I 'm an ER nurse . Night shifts on Fridays , that 's bizarre . Heh . If there 's anything that I can do to make it a little more pleasant , let me know . Actually , there is . Um ... Could you get my phone for me , please ? It 's in my handbag . Of course . Thank you . Mike , it 's me . No , I know . Um ... Yeah . Listen , I need you to pick up Sarah after school for me , please . No , I know it 's not your day . Um ... But , you know ... Please , Mike . Um , I 'll explain it to you later , okay ? Okay , bye . - Thanks . - Of course . Olivia . How long until this antidote is ready ? I 'll just check with Walter . - How close are we ? - We 're starting to see first results now . - But how long is it gonna take ? - At this rate , a couple more minutes . Hey , Walter , her temperature 's rising rapidly . How rapidly ? Two degrees in the past 23 seconds . - What about an ice bath ? - That won 't help . Just try to keep her calm . Jessica . Jessica . - I just want you to focus on me , okay ? - Okay . - Grab the ammonium nitrate . - Speed up the condensation ? - Unless you have a better idea . - She 's 104 degrees . - We need 60 seconds more . - We don 't have 60 seconds . Oh , my God , get away from me . Jessica , just focus on your breathing . - Walter . - Forty seconds more . It 's okay . How are you doing that ? Her temperature 's dropping . She 's okay . How did you do that ? I have no idea . This should permanently remove and neutralize the nanites in your system . Thank you . I can breathe now . You and a lot of other people . Walter , do you have any idea what just happened to me ? I can make an educated guess . Cortexiphan has given you certain kinetic powers . Moving molecules so quickly that you can create spontaneous combustion , yes . Or perhaps in this case , you slowed the molecules down causing her to cool down . But how did I do it ? I 'm afraid I have no idea . I should get her home . Let me know what happens with the others . I will . But now that the antidote 's been synthesized , they 'll all be fine . Thanks to you . Thank you . I don 't know how you did it , but you did . You know , not everybody would volunteer to be Walter 's guinea pig . Ha , ha . It wasn 't really for me . I 've got a 4-foot-tall redhead at home who 's constantly in dire need of mac and cheese and help with her math . - And her father 's an idiot . - Ha , ha . Well , if you ever need help getting to the head of the line in an ER ... And listen , if you find that you have any more symptoms , give me a call . I will . - Thank you . - Thank you . Bye . Dunham . We know who 's responsible . This was taken 10 minutes before the first victim was reported . Another camera picked him up leaving the scene . We lost him after that . Well , at least we know Jones is in our universe . What does infecting people with nanites have to do with ending the world ? Everything Jones has done has been in service of collapsing our two universes to create a third . But destroying the bridge ruined that plan . As far as we know . Think he found another way to create his own universe in place of ours ? I don 't know . But we do know Jones . We know he 's not gonna just give up . It can 't be . A chimeric structure in nanites ? I don 't believe it . That was Olivia . David Robert Jones is definitely behind this . Walter , what is it ? A hundred different ways to design a nanite and he chose this ? It 's inconceivable . Not by chance . Jones isn 't smart enough . Not by himself . Wait , what are you saying ? Jones didn 't create these nanites . They 're not his design . There 's only one person who would construct this particular pattern . Who ? I have bad news , sir . Agent Dunham has stopped us again . Don 't be so sure . Olivia beat us today . Clearly you don 't seem concerned . Don 't confuse a winning move with a winning game . This board never changes . How long do you take between moves ? Since the last move about 40 years . In this game , the skill one must have above all else is patience . The board changes but very slowly . The art of chess the art , is knowing when a piece is most valuable and then in that very moment , being willing to sacrifice it . For in the vacuum created by the loss of what is most precious opportunity abounds influence is maximized and desire becomes destiny . For example on this board the most valuable piece is the bishop . Therefore , for the game to be won ... The bishop must be sacrificed . I 'll attend to it . Promptly . He 's alive . I 'm telling you , he 's alive . I know that Jones ' plan was too ingenious , too remarkable that it had to have come from Belly . He 's alive , Nina . The nanotech that Jones used on the escalator , I 've examined them . They were built by Belly . I 'd recognize his work anywhere . - His methodology was all over it . - Jones had access to many projects . He could simply have copied William 's research ... Nina ! It was the work of a master , not an imposter . I know the difference . Walter said Bell died in a car accident on New Year 's Day seven years ago ? Yes . I went to the hospital . I saw his body . But it wasn 't New Year 's . It was Christmas . I always thought that he died on New Year because he came to visit me the night before to say goodbye . Walter , what are you talking about ? When I was in St. Claire 's , Belly came to visit me . It was New Year 's Eve , 2005 . They gave me additional shocks that day , so I can 't remember what he said . - Nina , I know you loved him ... - Oh , Walter , just stop it ! The car crash wasn 't an accident . William had lymphoma . He 'd been trying to fight it , but ... I think he didn 't want me to see him that way . He didn 't want to be vulnerable . He wanted to go out on his own terms , and he did . - It 's still possible . - Walter , anything is possible . But the man I knew wouldn 't try to destroy a universe . That doesn 't sound like William . Fine . I 'll prove it to you . If my son is not too busy monitoring my cure , I 'd like him to meet us . Where ? Well , well . Wally Bishop . Hey , doc , you just visiting or are you coming back to stay for a while ? Good news . The administrator can see us now . Everything okay ? Fine . I 'm sorry , we 're still transitioning to a more up-to-date , record-keeping system . Federal funding isn 't all it used to be . In fairness , I 'm told it never was good . So technically , it never was what it used to be . I guess now it 's just worse . But I 'm confident these are all the visitor logs during the period of Dr. Bishop 's ... - Incarceration . I was going to say treatment . It has a nicer sound and I 'd like to think is more reflective of what we do here . Would you , now ? What about your surveillance archives ? Security cameras ? I 'm afraid our current mainframe storage capacity is limited . The institution doesn 't keep anything older than two years . - How convenient . - Walter . Dr. Benlo has been cooperating fully . Do you see anything in those that suggests the logs have been doctored ? No . Matter of fact , they 're perfect . Very thorough . Every single individual logged in and out . And no William Bell . Walter you said that you had been having a lot of shock therapy . Think perhaps it could have been a hallucination ? No . No , no . My hallucinations were rarely biped and never men . - Dr. Bishop , are you ... ? - Crazy ? No . May I borrow this ? Um ... Well , those records have already been digitized ... Thank you . Let 's go . Thank you . I must say , you 're much prettier than your predecessor . You 've been talking for hours I don 't know why Walter needed that log book . And he 's not telling me . And he won 't back off that Bell thing either . Oh , man . It 's okay . I got it . - God . - Oh , that 's gotta smart . Heh . That 's what happens when you drink and mince . Heh . Thank you . It 's only natural What 's the matter ? Are you worried about Walter ? You shouldn 't be . No , I 'm not thinking about Walter . The things they taught you They 're lining up to haunt you I was thinking about that girl , Jessica . One encounter with us and her child almost becomes an orphan . We deal with this every day . Won 't you pick up the receiver ? We 're playing the odds , Peter . I mean , what do you really think our chances are of having a normal life ? It doesn 't have to be so dark Olivia , I know you 're scared about what happened in the lab . I don 't know what 's happening to me . What I 'm becoming . I 've got this power inside me . And it terrifies me because I don 't understand it and I want it out . Okay . So we 'll figure it out . Together . Is that a personal guarantee ? After all we 've been through I will not lose you again , Olivia . - I 'm starving . - Ha , ha . What 's a guy gotta do to get a good home-cooked meal around here ? Where are you now ? Just passing Kenmore Square . What do you mean , it 's the sun ? Even though we can 't see it , it 's in the sky . Jones must be reflecting the light off something , like one of those disco balls and then focusing it like we do with a magnifying glass . - How is he doing that ? - Not sure yet . But I have my suspicions . Yeah , Farnsworth . Agent ID JH112402 . Why is he doing it ? Seems like he 's trying to burn a hole to China . It 's a myth . Technically it would be India . But I doubt it . What does this have to do with nanites ? And how do we even know it 's Jones ? Heh . So you are prepared to concede this may well be the work of William Bell ? - Not my point . - Okay , thanks . - Satellite imagery ? - I just got access to the system . Radio waves ? Coming online right now . I need geological data on Beacon Hill . - Which one do you want me to do first ? - All of them . You said that Agent Broyles was on-site . Is he evacuating the area ? - Yes , one square mile from the beam . - Okay , Walter , the geological is printing . - Oh , no . - Oh , no , what ? I knew I 'd read something about this . Three months ago a subterranean oil reservoir was discovered below Beacon Hill . - What does that mean ? - Imagine putting a match to a can of lighter fluid . Unless we stop this soon that sunbeam will essentially set Boston on fire from below . Peter , you should alert Agent Broyles . Tell him he needs to evacuate an area with a radius much wider than one mile . - How much ? - All of it . - All of what ? - Boston . We 'll call you back . You 're right . There is a radio frequency that 's not owned by the government transmitting in the S-band . - What 's the frequency ? - Two-two-zero-two-point-five-one-eight . Actually , there 's two frequencies . - What ? - Also 0.520 . Of course . You brilliant bastard , Belly . Quick , get me something to write on . - Dunham . - Turn around . Head south . Towards Beach Street on the edge of Chinatown . - Why ? What 's there ? - I believe that 's where Jones is commanding the satellites from . What satellites , Walter ? Jones has commandeered two private satellites or maybe he launched them . They 're the disco balls that are bouncing the sunlight around . I triangulated the signals . And they appear to be coming from the 1600 block off Beach Street . Interrupt the signals and you shut off the sun . - Well , you know what I mean . - Okay , we 're on our way . Ah . Get a knife . My lemon cake 's ready . Walter , if you were hungry , I could have gotten you something . This is not about food , Athos , this is about Bell . Where 's the knife ? Please ? Quickly ? All right , this is the 1600 block . - You see anything ? - Peter , look . That antenna . Do you think that 's what 's controlling the satellites ? It could be . There 's the other one . Okay , I 'll take this one , you take the other . I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do . We got to turn them off . Just figure it out when we get up there . Oh , my God , that smells terrible . What is it ? Lemon cake . Laced with pig brain . - What ? - Hmm ? Lemon cake is the perfect incubator . I thought it was easier to get pig brain on short notice than a human specimen . Is that from the log book at St. Claire 's ? Just the relevant page . I first tried scraping it , hoping Belly had left some DNA behind but he was too clever . Or maybe he was never there in the first place . I know none of you believe me , which is why I 've conducted this little experiment . The pig brain is activating a little-known side effect of Cortexiphan which is temporary tissue regeneration . Heated between 90 and 100 degrees the Cortexiphan I 've added to the pig brain should cause at least partial regeneration of all biological matter on the sheet of paper . And voila , fingerprints . Although identifying Belly 's prints from these smudges may prove impossible after all . What is that brown mark ? Don 't know . Walter . Huh . As I said , the Cortexiphan is regenerative . You shouldn 't eat it , though . Almond oil . I knew it . Chilean almonds . Almonds ? Belly was obsessed with them . Even had an agreement with the importers . They sold them to him wholesale . He must have had that oil on his fingertips . Walter , what are you doing ? I 'm going to find Belly . A1 Imports . Down by the seaport . Walter , would you stop ? This is nuts . I 'm not crazy . At least I 'll be able to confirm that he 's still alive . Would you excuse me ? What about Olivia and Peter ? Doing everything they can . Nothing we can do to help them . What do you think you 're gonna find there ? Walter . Walter . I know this is a wild-goose chase . A fool 's errand . And I am a fool . But no one is asking you to join me , Alex . It 's my hunch , and I am quite capable of pursuing it on my own . So peace out . - I don 't ... - Drive . Alex ? I was on a roll . Got it . - You found the control panel ? - Yeah . Now find the dial marked " transmission amplitude . " That 's the one that needs to be tuned all the way down . - Okay , got it . - But not yet . Not yet . Sorry . We have to do it together . If we don 't , the beam could go off-kilter , cut a swath across Boston . Be sort of like don 't cross the streams , just , you know , in reverse . You know I have no idea what you 're talking about . Yes , I know . Okay . Tell me when . Okay . In three two , one , go . You did it . Good job . Jones ! Hey ! Security ! - I 'm FBI . I can show you my badge . - Drop your weapon . I said drop it . Now ! How did you ... ? I got it wrong . I was the sacrifice . I was the bishop . - Tailfins ? - Yes . Tailfins . Whitewall tires . Two-tone paint jobs . Sure , by today 's standards , terrible for the environment but there 's something to be said for style . A1 Imports . Come on , dear . Walter , they 're probably not even ... Ye of little faith . It 's just as I remember it . I used to accompany Belly here on his visits . Not a smell you forget . - Smells like sweat . - Exactly . Hello . Hello , sir . My name is Walter Bishop . I 'm sorry to trouble you so late . I was hoping to speak with Ms. Weisberg . - I 'm sorry . Who ? - Lynn Weisberg . Uh , lovely woman . Yay high . - Nice laugh . - Walter , I don 't think he knows her . She 's the owner . Or she was . I was hoping to ask her about a particular customer . I think I get it . You 're talking about that import / export company . Well , they went out of business three years ago . - I see . - Tom . Do you copy ? Yes , I 'm here . Coming right now . Look , I have to go . Um , thanks for your help . Sorry to have bothered you . No bother . Maybe we should ask around . Maybe someone else ... - Walter , he had a gun . - What ? A dangerous neighborhood . Whatever the reason , there are no almonds here . Did you hear that ? Yes . - Walter . - Come on . Come on . Walter . What are those ? One of them sounds almost like a rhino but more nasal . I 'm sorry , we were leaving and then we heard a noise ... - Tell him we have visitors . - Sir , I 'm with the FBI . - Uh-uh . - You 're making a ... Stop ! Hands where I can see them . Look , this is all just a misunderstanding . Walter , come on . Oh , oh , oh . No . No . I 'm not sure I ever thought I would see you again . Hello , old friend .

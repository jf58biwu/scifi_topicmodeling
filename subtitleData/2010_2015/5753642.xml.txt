 Mom ? Are you too sick to come to the party ? I 'm fine . You know , it 's just my body readjusting , that 's all . I 'll be right there , okay ? Woman : Still no answers as to what caused yesterday 's blackout , Leaving nearly 60,000 homes in the district without power . I can 't imagine . I 'm away from bill and the kids for two days , and it 's like ... It 's tough . Oh , yeah . So what 's your secret ? A lot of v-chrons . And no alcohol ? Nope . I have not had a drink in 13 months . What ? Can 't risk getting a dui in space . Molly , molly , can 't wait to hear all about it . You know what , that 's the saddest story I 've . Ever heard . We have to remedy that right now . Uh , we can 't . No can 'ts , we 're doing shots . Mm-hmm , well , ask the doctor here . Not until her tests come back . One shot . Listen , when her tests come back , I will personally write her . A prescription for margaritas . Thank you . Child : Ethan , get off him ! Stop . You 're gonna hurt him . Ethan . Hey . What are you doing ? He wouldn 't give me the ball . And your solution was to push him down ? Ethan , what do you say ? I 'm sorry . It 's okay . If you do this again , no more party for you . Understand ? So sorry , guys . Yeah . All right , it 's fine . You okay ? That 's okay . Let 's go play . You 've got to be exhausted , go on up . I can take out the trash . Moll . Got to get back to the routine , right ? I was angry . Is that what you 're supposed to do when you get angry ? Hurt someone ? No . How do you think you would have felt if you 'd really hurt jake ? Bad . Well , I sure hope so . Mom 's mad at me . No , no . She 's not mad . But it 's different now . With her . Your mom has to get used to being back home again . She was up there a long time . All by herself . It 's gonna take a while for everything to feel normal again , But it will . I promise . Okay . Get a good night 's sleep . We have a big day tomorrow . I think I need a flip . Let me see . Well , yeah . You 're right . All set . I love you . Will you leave my night-light on ? Sure . What brought this on ? I had a dream . Do you dream about marcus much ? Less and less as I get older . I still think about him . Every now and then . What do you think about ? How if he were still alive , there would be no us . No ethan . Without marcus dying , We may have never even met . Maybe you 'd still be with him . Well , you know what ? I think we always end up . Where we 're supposed to . Female voice : Approaching yasumoto corp . Hey . Listen to me . When I talk about you today ... Hey . When I talk about you today , I 'm gonna talk a bit about how you were originally created . For the program , but it doesn 't mean I don 't see you as real . Okay ? I 'm not . Well ... Yes , you are . You exist , just like me . Just like your mom . Okay ? Jubes ! Rabbit ! Oh . Look at you . He 's been practicing . You nervous ? Uh ... walk in the park . Exactly . I don 't even know . Where to begin . You were on the seraphim station . For 13 months . A solo mission . Yes . You were alone the whole time ? Well , that 's why they call it a solo mission . Well ... Then I ... I honestly d ... I don 't understand this . Understand what ? I know there weren 't any other . Isea missions in that quadrant . Molly , Was there an emergency . That I didn 't hear about , An international crew that docked ? No . Why ? You 're pregnant . What ? You 're pregnant . But-but ... That 's not possible . Male voice : Five dollars for the swear jar . Put it on my tab . Of course . Let 's run the probe 's data deck . And check for problems with the samples . Maybe I contaminated ' em somehow before they left . I find that unlikely . Aren 't you sweet . I have my moments . Molly . Go ahead . You have an incoming v-chron . Bay 1 , please . Sending bay 1 . The camera 's on . Say hello . Hello . Man : You want to tell her ? Go ahead . I got accepted into school . I had my last meeting with the principal this morning . We 're gonna wait for you to get back for the orie ... Ben ? I 'm detecting interference from a solar flare . Shall I attempt to restart after it passes ? Sure . Attempt to re ... Ben ? Ben ? There has to be some kind of explanation . How ' bout you made a mistake . Molly , I ran every single sample from your tether twice . Are you sure there was no one else ? How many times are you gonna ask me this ? And even if there was , you know I can 't get pregnant . We tried for years . Were you taking the fertility drugs ? No . No . I-I stopped taking those way before ethan . I 'm just asking every rational question I can think of . For the report . You can 't put this in the report . Molly , this report goes straight to director sparks . I can 't lie . I 'm not asking you to lie . I 'm asking for some time . As my friend . As your friend , I should be admitting you . For observation right now . That 's exactly what I 'm afraid of . I just got back to my family , sam . I don 't want to end up in quarantine . Just give me some time . To figure it out before I tell john . John : At the humanichs project . We recognize that we live in a world of machines . Most of us interact . With one form or another from the time we wake up . Until the time we go to sleep . We 've outsourced many of our day-to-day activities to robots . That have made our lives way more efficient , But in the process we 've removed the all-important element . Of human connection . Deep down , we all know . That robots are not really human . A medi-assist bot has 100 % accuracy rating when administering a vaccine , But it cannot comfort a child . Who 's afraid of the needle . A task-android can process your bank deposit , But it can 't share your joy . When it helps you buy your first home . It turns out the true uncanny valley . Isn 't visual at all . It 's the valley of genuine connection . The goal of the humanichs project is to bridge that divide . By bringing humanity to the machine . How are we going to do that ? By creating an artificial intelligence designed . From the very beginning to seek connection . Programmed not by ones and zeroes that we type . Into interfaces but by day-to-day human experience . Ladies and gentlemen , Let me introduce you to my son . Ethan . Go get ' em , rabbit . Man : Harmon kryger . He passed away before I came on board . Were you close ? Yeah . He was a good guy . So I heard . Dr. Woods , I 'm gordon kern . The new deputy director . That would be me . It 's a tragic situation . Shall we ? I have to be honest . I spent all weekend preparing . To grill you on your logs , mm . But your work is incredibly thorough . Leaves very little left to the imagination . There was one thing . The gap . Yes , the gap . Well , that 's easily explained , actually ... If you don 't mind , we 'll wait for director sparks . I know he has questions . Well , there 's something I 'm sure everyone in this room is ... Curious about , but we 're all either too ... Polite or too embarrassed to ask . The robot uprising , am I right ? What 's to stop the humanichs from overthrowing us one day . And enslaving their human overlords ? Is that the question ? Absolutely nothing . How then would an owner control and manage their behavior ? It 's not a master-slave relationship . My partners and I. Believe if we want machines to be more human , We have to give them the human experience . They have to learn like children learn . The humanichs brain learns right from wrong , Good from bad , the same way we all did . For the most part . What do you mean , for the most part ? Well , there is no guarantee with any child , Because , in the end , they 're free to choose their own path . Dr. Woods , my name is femi dodd . I chair a number of programs for mr . Yasumoto . What is the protocol in the event your experiment fails ? Do you have an emergency plan for their shutdown ? To preserve their power ? Absolutely . It 's called interlude mode . Do you mind ? Excuse me , Dr. Woods . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean for the resting mode . I meant for their termination . To kill them ? That wording is a bit inelegant but yes . Do you have a child ? I have a daughter . Do you have a plan to kill her ? My daughter 's a human being . I don 't understand the difference . Well , for starters , she has a soul . With all due respect , ms . Dodd , There is no such thing as a soul . What you call a soul , I call a cumulative effect of a lifetime of experience . Simple information traveling in the neuropathways in your daughter 's brain . Believe it or not , dr . Woods , there are . Plenty of people in this world who still believe that there is . More to us than can be explained by science . Well ... Those people are idiots . Man : Dr. Woods . Dodd : I am one of those idiots . I 'm sorry . I accept your apology . No , I mean I 'm sorry you 're one of those idiots . That 's enough . How dare you ? How dare you ask me . Do I have a contingency plan to murder my son . And you 're asking us for funding that can unleash thousands , Maybe millions of these humanichs on the world . It 's a perfectly valid question . What sort of controls and restrictions . Would you put in place to ensure they behave properly ? And I gave you my answer , mr . Segers . Absolutely none . The security and life support systems . Were back online almost immediately , But the communication system . Stayed down for approximately 13 hours . As it says in my log book there , I spent most of that time . Trying to get the system up and running again , but , Unfortunately , I was unsuccessful . I then went to sleep for three hours , And when I woke up , everything seemed . Back to normal . It took you all that time to reboot ben ? Have you ever tried to work on that thing ? No . During that 13 hours , did anything else happen ? Anything anomalous ? Uh ... Related to the solar flare ? Everything is right here in the log . There 's one thing I 'd like to clear up . The security system records each quadrant . Of the seraphim with banks of surveillance cameras . Presumably , they were up and running . As soon as that emergency power kicked back on , But that footage was deleted from the system 's memory . There had been several . Instances of interference in the months prior , But none quite to this level . In the past , what I had done is . Make a copy of the footage , just in case . I went to do the same thing this time , But instead of copying the footage , I accidentally deleted it . The only record of that time . Is what I manually entered into my log . I take complete responsibility for that error , sir . Well , sounds like we didn 't miss much . Just me swearing at a bunch of inanimate objects . I 'm still waiting for your medical examinations , But as soon as I 've had a chance to review them , And you complete a series of psychiatric evaluations , We 'll put this one in the books . Psychiatric evaluations ? Just a few meetings in addition to your post-morts . To help with your reentry . It 's a change in agency policy after what happened . With harmon kryger last year . I probably should have warned you before I brought you over . There 's just as much bureaucracy . Now that we 're in the private sector . Sir , if you want to make it , you 'd better leave now . Off-campus meeting . It 's a pleasure to have you back , molly . You were missed . Thank you , sir . How 's he doing ? He 's ready . Sparks : Welcome back , mr . Yasumoto . We found something of an anomaly on the seraphim . An anomaly ? Another solar flare knocked out the communications system . Like kryger . Yes . But , unlike kryger , We 're missing the security camera footage . For the 13 hours that followed . That seems like an unlikely coincidence . Even more so if you know the astronaut involved . Molly woods . She claims she accidentally deleted it . You don 't believe her ? No . Why not ? Because she doesn 't make those kinds of mistakes . This could be everything . Stay close . About that . Her husband john gave a presentation . To your board today , but was denied funding . I can only do so much from the isea . A gesture from you could put us closer to the family . It might make it easier to keep an eye on her . This is the last one . Oh , wow . Automated female voice : John , you have an incoming call from yasumoto corp . Dr. Woods . Hideki yasumoto . Thanks for coming . Oh , please . Uh , it 's an hon ... It 's an honor . The honor is all mine . I have a very important mission today , And I think you 're just the guy to help me . What kind of mission ? Um ... It 's a search . A search for what ? I realized that in order to further the goal of humanichs , To give him a true human experience , He needed to be part of a family unit . To be raised in a home . So , I brought him into ours . My wife and I struggled for years with infertility , And , eventually , we were told we would never be able . To have a child . That can have a profound effect on a marriage . As happy as we were , there was something missing . And-and that was ethan . So , you see humanichs as a cure for childless couples . Adoption , surrogacy ... those are all viable options ... Thank you . But not everyone is a viable candidate . There will always be people with a need . For companionship and-and connection . If your board had let me finish , I would have told them . That filling that void is way more important . Than building a more empathetic service bar . I 'm sure you understand . That the future you 're proposing raises great moral questions . Yes , but it also raises great possibilities . I agree . Unfortunately , the long-term prospects are too murky . For yasumoto corporation to invest in at this time . The board 's decision will have to stand . We have responsibilities to our shareholders . Of course . Yeah , I fully understand . I-I really just appreciate your time . However , as a private citizen , I would not be bound by those same responsibilities . How is it ? Good . Do you want to try ? Okay . Mmm . That is good . Want to try mine ? Sure . I like yours better . Want to switch ? Okay . Man : Excuse me , ma 'am . Here you go . No , thanks . This one is for you . It 's already paid for . By whom ? Uh ... He 's gone . Sorry . Come on , let 's go . Mom ! You made me drop my ice cream ! Okay . Look , have this one . I don 't want that one . I want another one ... Like this . Okay , this is the one you chose . I don 't want it anymore . Let 's go . I want another ice cream . Ethan ! We have to go right now . No ! Ethan ! Ethan ! Ethan ? Ethan ? Ethan . It was like this when I found it . Your hair looks really pretty . I don 't know what 's going on with him , But he is not the same as when I left here . No , he 's not . He 's a year older . That is not what I 'm talking about . He 's changed . And so have you . That 's called life . That 's the consequence of our family . Being apart for so long . It takes time to reconnect . And I 'm trying . Uh , are you ? Yes . Because it feels like you 're pulling away from us . I don 't know what 's happened , but I 've felt it . And he 's felt it , too . Ever since you got back . Well , it wasn 't that easy before I left here . Not easy like it was for you . We 've always seen him differently . I see him as our son . And so do I. But the way . He looked at me today ... you should have seen it . It was almost as if he hated me . He doesn 't hate you , molly . He loves you . He doesn 't love me . He executes a series of commands that you 've . Programmed into him . He approximates a behavior . That resembles love . But that 's not love . I don 't know what 's going on with you , But you have to figure it out , because that kid . Is the closest we 're ever gonna get to being parents . I got the funding from yasumoto . We start immediately . Female voice : Camera recording . Marcus . Hello ? Hello . You need help ? Help . What can I do ? Do . It 's okay . It 's ... Okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . John : Molly . I 'm sorry about yesterday . Well , you didn 't say anything that wasn 't true . This opportunity with yasumoto , It may not be the ideal time , but , Molly , if we can make it work ... We 'll make it work . Have I said congratulations ? No . Congratulations . Woman : Reentry can be a challenge . After this kind of extended mission , especially . If there are spouses and children involved . So , The agency would like us to meet for a few sessions . I want this office to be a sanctuary for you . A place where you can . Talk about anything and everything . We didn 't have this resource in place . For your colleague , dr . Kryger . We should have . The agency believes a lack of attention to his mental state . Was a factor in his suicide . I agree . Why don 't we begin with your own assessment . About where you are in your transition . How are you feeling ? Molly : Physically ? Woman : Whatever you 'd like to share . Physically . Emotionally , mentally . Okay . Female voice : Beginning playback . Harmon ? It 's me . I 'm real . It 's not like on the seraphim . You 're not hallucinating . Everybody thinks you 're dead . I-I shouldn 't have ... I shouldn 't have come here . Harmon . Talk to me . What happened ? John : Molly ? Dinner 's ready . I 'll find you . Until then , be careful . Don 't trust them . Who ? Anybody . Anybody .

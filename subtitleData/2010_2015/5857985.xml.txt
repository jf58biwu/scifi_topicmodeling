 You were talking about brainwashing . Are you ready to comply , agent 33 ? Happy to comply . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s becoming a problem . Do we know who 's in charge ? I 'm afraid not . S.H.I.E.L.D. Will keep dropping off presents like this . All we ask for in return is a little breathing room . Sorry . I 'm gonna have to say no to that deal . Coulson : Since simmons left , he 's only getting worse . He 's grown isolated . Who you talking to ? Me . What ? No one . What do you want , raina ? It 's what I don 't want , Which is the obelisk falling into the hands Of people who don 't understand it . I know he 's keeping something from me , And it 's not just because he 's the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. It 's been 18 days since your last episode . And I 'm tired of fighting it . Skye : I think something is wrong with him . Is coulson okay ? [ indistinct conversations ] [ horn honks ] Your grace , thank you for coming . Trying to understand this tragedy , and ... Show it to me . O-of course . This way , please . Here . It dates back to Spain , the early 1500s . It was the only item in our entire church that was spared . It 's a miracle ... One which might help us rebuild . Experts will have to verify it , of course . Your grace , shouldn 't it be enough Simply to believe in the miracle ? Faith is enough for us , but the rest of the world ... They 'll need something more tangible . Why ? Do you have some reservation ? There is one more thing . [ indistinct conversations ] I should really be getting ready for the party . Besides , I thought you said you wanted time in the ocean . I 've seen it ... fish , waves ... whatever . I found something far more captivating . [ birds calling ] The rabbit 's in the hutch . I 'm on my way . I think we 'll make it . Hunter did a good job , uh , Distracting gabriel soto 's executive assistant . Triplett : Oh , I bet he did . Damn . Tickets cost $ 25,000 ? Each . That 's why I 'm going for the five-finger discount . [ keys clacking ] mack ? You 're on . Mack : Copy that . We 're pulling up now . Thank you . Sir , notice the car ? 1962 rolls ... restored it myself . I noticed . Still not letting you work on lola . In time , sir . In time . This is fun , right ? Isn 't this fun ? Look ... cufflinks . I will pay you $ 500 right now for a pair of flats . Good luck , sir . [ both sigh ] [ car door closes ] Identification , please . Coulson : Of course . Charles , you 've got mine , right ? I like making him carry my things ... gives him purpose . Plus , that way I know she can 't take off without me . Oh , well , you never know when a better offer might come along . [ beeping ] [ beeping ] Enjoy the party . Thank you . Darling ? Good work on the cover , skye . We 're in . Skye : Okay . Remember , soto has the painting in a sublevel storage room Until it comes out later tonight for the guests . May : How heavy is the security ? Skye : Still assessing . Let 's assume " very . " Keep in mind we 've got diplomats here , state officials . Bridget said soto 's sending out the painting for verification She , uh , whispered it in my ear , if you know what I mean . Coulson : Yes , everybody on the planet Knows what you mean , hunter . Let 's focus . Right , so upshot is tonight 's our one chance to steal this thing . Director , are you sure you don 't want me there ? Get around any security measures soto has in ... No , keeping it to two agents Allows us to minimize detection in a small space . I hope you don 't need me to explain covert operations again . No , sir . Good . This writing was in garrett 's lab , the obelisk , And now a 500-year-old piece of art . It 's important . Getting that painting could mean answers for us . Yes , sir . We will ... [ woman laughing ] Wait . What was that ? Aw ! [ laughing ] Yeah . That 's may . I-is she okay ? Is everything okay ? [ laughing continues ] Yes . She 's laughing . Coulson : I think the worst of it 's over now . Excuse me . My face hurts . We got a cover to maintain and some details to go over . Going radio silent . We 'll resume contact shortly . [ beep ] Did they just turn off their comms ? [ soft jazz music plays ] Well , hey , look at that . You still remember the steps ... impressive . My 10 : 00 ... security chief standing watch . Dance elective at the academy . Hmm . Of course , I dropped it two weeks later . Dome camera ... 3 : 00 . I count seven uniforms . Walkie , sidearm , baton . I just wanted to graduate So I could get actual field assignments . You weren 't exactly thrilled when we got assigned That retrieval op in sausalito ... That coffee shop , our first mission ? That 's because the commander sent us in with no exit plan . I was in the bay for five hours . I fished you out ... Eventually . We used to have fun like this in our youth . You know you enjoyed it . Yes . Then life happened . Nostalgia 's fine , but I 'd rather deal with reality . You planning to talk to me about your hand ? What about it ? You think I didn 't see it tremoring the whole flight out ? Your symptoms are getting worse . Did the rest of the team see it ? No . They 're good . Skye 's asking the usual too many questions , But they think it 's a standard op ... Don 't know it 's personal . Okay . Phil , if I think this mission is too much for you , I 'll pull the plug . Yes , fine . I understand . But that 's not why I turned off the comms . I know you don 't want to talk about this , But we need to make a plan in case I go the way of garrett . You 're right . I don 't want to talk about this . We both know how this could end . I know it 's uncomfortable , but it 's also necessary . No , phil . Look . Talbot . There goes our cover . [ indistinct conversations ] Well , hey , there , general . Fancy meeting you here . Hey , yourself . Good to see you . I 'm glad to hear that . Now that we 've put all our differences behind us ? Absolutely . How many of those have you had ? One too many . [ chuckles ] It 'll be our secret , as long as you keep mine . Well , that doesn 't sound like a fair trade . Look , I appreciate you not blowing my cover ... Yet . Let 's just say , hypothetically , you don 't . This mission will benefit both of us . Benefit us hypothetically . Your division has benefited plenty From my assistance , actually ... your career , too . Sure . So , I 'm gonna keep moving forward with my operation . I hope I don 't have to worry about interference . I won 't interfere ... Unless I feel I need to . Nice work out there . Do we get to keep the scooter ? Nice work yourself , Though it didn 't look like you were suffering too much . And I was babysitting an empty plane . How is this fair ? It 's weird ... women just like me , always have . Never understood it . Must be a magnetism thing , I guess . If it makes you feel any better , I don 't get it , either . If I wanted someone to take jabs at me , I 'd still be married . Mm . Not this story again . Can we not ? Oh , no , I think we can . I first met her on a spring night . She was on the pier facing the outer banks , The moonlight glinting off her face . Mm-hmm . She resembled a goddess . Of course , that was her cruel trick . [ beep ] coulson : Guys ? Best timing ever . Oh , decided to come back online , did we ? Talbot 's here . Talbot , talbot ? What the hell 's he doing there ? No idea . All that matters is our cover 's at risk , We 're not gonna wait till later to get the painting . We 're gonna get it now . I 'll take point . Well , I just think it 's so admirable What you 're doing for that poor church that burned down . I should be thanking you for your generous patronage . You know , santa maria de las flores Was my second home . Oh . Though I 'm really surprised That you and I have never met before . I would have remembered you . Well , I bet letting people see the miracle painting in person Is bringing out all kinds of donors That you haven 't met before . But just remember , I 'm here for the cause ... Well , the cause and the company . She just said more words than I 've heard her say in a year . [ sighs ] I just have to say , philanthropy is my passion . All right , agent may . That 's very alarming . I 'm all about giving . [ speaking spanish ] [ chuckles ] [ speaking spanish ] [ laughs ] I must get a picture of us together . Charles , come here . Honey , can you take a picture of me and mr . Soto ? It 'll be such a nice memento of the evening . Oh , yes , that would be nice . [ chuckles ] he 's your husband ? We 're modern . Charles , please ? Hang on , heidi . Just trying to find the flash . [ sighs ] honestly , this happens every time . They sell these phones to children . [ laughs ] Okay . Excuse me . I should go see about my other guests . Oh , no , no , no , please . Uno momento . Yes , yes , yes . One moment , and ... [ camera shutter clicks ] there we go . [ laughs ] well , it was just ... Wasn 't it just ? Hmm ? Mr. Soto , thank you so much . Lovely party . Goodbye . [ laughs ] come on , dear . No idea . I think talbot 's still pissed 'cause we kidnapped him that time . We need to do this now . [ keypad beeping ] yo . [ thud ] I could have handled him . I did . [ beeping ] They 're gonna be onto us soon . I know . Almost there . [ beeping ] [ elevator bell dings ] I really like that dress . Skye : Sublevel storage room straight ahead ... painting 's there . Great . Everything 's gonna be a little more fast and dirty Than we planned . Only makes it more interesting . See ? The exuberance of youth . Guys , wait . You 're about to hit ... Laser grids . Why is it always laser grids ? Guy 's not kidding around . [ sighs ] Mnh . Okay . I got this . [ alarm blaring ] They already know we 're here . There 's no painting here . Could be a mistake . Another room , maybe ? No , it 's not a mistake . A record of appropriation just popped up on the church 's books . Don 't tell me ... the u.S. Government . Talbot took possession of the painting " related to an ongoing government investigation , " It says . Why is he even on this ? How does he know about that painting ? We need to ... we need to go . Yes , I 've got it . There was one problem , though ... S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s here . Look . Recognize them ? [ beeping ] Fascinating . Talbot : They weren 't any trouble . You want me to come in ? No . I have a new plan . Quadrant 6 clear ! Check quadrant 4 ! You take right . I 'll take left . I assume this all makes you happy . Why would this make me happy ? We 're outnumbered , trapped , hoping not to get killed . [ indistinct shouting ] yeah . I guess talbot took this round . I 'm not giving up yet . No . You always have my back . Speaking of , when we get out of this , We 're having a real conversation about a contingency plan . Over here . This way . You can 't avoid it anymore . We 're clear . Agent coulson ... Agent may ... You seem like you 're in a hurry . The caterers ran out of coconut shrimp ... no reason to stay . You see , I was worried you left Because I got my hands on the miracle painting and you didn 't . Come on , coulson . It 's obvious we were there for the same thing . Now , I 've been thinking ... [ scoffs ] I 'm sure . I know there 's writing on the back of that painting . The government wouldn 't have sent me down here if we didn 't . Phil , you 're the only one That can help me figure out what that writing is . It 's what you do . So why don 't we help each other ? Why would I help you ? I got to believe you want to know what that writing means Just as badly as we do . Yeah . Why do I have a feeling there 's a catch ? There 's no catch . You 'll have to examine it in a secure military facility Where I can keep an eye on you , But that 's just ... Regulation . Okay . You got a deal . Excellent . Just let me check in with my team . You know , they 'll get nervous if I just disappear . What do you need ... about an hour ? That ought to do it . I 'm downtown at the hotel la ona . I 'll see you there . I look forward to it . [ car door closes , engine turns over ] Change of heart ... doesn 't add up . No . He 's working us . I just need to know why . [ sighs ] I 'll handle it . May . Hey , this is the part I do . It will make up for all the dancing . You liked it . No , I didn 't . Little bit ? Little bit . Check in as soon as you know something . And if something goes wrong ... I 'll handle it . [ beeping ] Don 't remember coulson asking you To do extra research on this thing . I 'm being industrious . Or are you digging into a top-secret mission To find out about the parts they 're not telling us ? I 'm a good , helpful soldier . Well , I happen to appreciate your instinct to be thorough . I myself prefer a pint and a good nap , But , then , I 'm the lazy type . " lazy " is not the first word that comes to mind . Dangerous ? [ breathes sharply ] I understand . But truly , it should be " lazy . " I just hide it well . Think that 's what drove away the ex-wife ? See , now you 're bringing it back up . It didn 't work out because interspecies relationships are hard . I was a human , whereas she was a demonic hell-beast . He doesn 't like her . Triplett : You don 't say . She 's pure evil . Hey , at least you got away from your ex . Is now the psycho living in our basement . You know , I wish I could relate , but all my exes are awesome . Is that right ? I seem to remember an entire year Where you had to pretend you liked quinoa . Yeah . That was a dark time . Fitz , go join them . They 're bonding . You 'll be left out . [ both grunting ] What have you done with talbot ? I 'm right here . [ electricity crackles ] [ electricity crackles ] So that 's agent may . I guess the file wasn 't overselling her . If coulson sent her , It would seem he doesn 't fully trust general talbot . So what now ? We have dr . Whitehall 's mission to complete . We need to send in someone agent coulson does trust . [ beeping ] [ beep ] may : Yeah . Why do I have a feeling there 's a catch ? Yeah . Why do I have a feeling there 's a catch ? Why do I have a feeling there 's a catch ? How do I look ? Just get coulson back here . I 'll take it from that point . This should help you neutralize coulson 's team . [ beeping ] [ ringing ] Coulson : May , you all right ? I checked on talbot . The offer seems solid . But I think he 's keeping it from his superiors , So we don 't have a lot of time . I 'm coming back to get you . Be ready . Copy that . See you when I see you . [ beep ] Got his location . Go there . [ beep ] [ door closes ] Do you really think running away is the answer ? I 'm not running away . I wanted to be alone . Nonsense . You hate being alone . As evidenced by you . You 're avoiding something . Talking ... they 're just talking , And I 'm having trouble with that lately . You 're doing fine talking to me . Yes , but I think you 're ignoring A rather significant elephant in the room . You 're not afraid to talk . You 're afraid you 'll have nothing to say . Just tell them what you 're thinking , how you 're feeling . Yeah , ' cause that 's worked out so well for me in the past . Besides ... Do we even have anything in common With that lot ? Not anymore . Not even a ... Part of ... The team ? [ sighs ] mm-hmm . Of course you are . O-or you could be , if you 'd just engage with them Instead of hiding out here in the garage . Yeah , well , it 's not supposed to be a garage . It 's supposed to be our lab , our place . But they changed it ... didn 't even ask me , just did it . The new lab is beautiful . It 's bigger . It 's got mo ... Yes , but it 's not ours , and they didn 't ask me Because they don 't care what I have to say . Fitz . Even ward 's more valuable than me . And he 's perfectly able to speak in complete sentences . Should have heard the excuses he had for what he did to us . Listen . You may be stumbling and stuttering on the outside , But you have to let them see who you really are Underneath all that . Where 's coulson ? Upstairs . Coulson : I don 't know what he was doing there . I don 't know how he ... May , we 're just figuring out whether or not we should ... Good . Coulson . So , talbot was being honest ? Surprised the hell out of me , too ... trust me . It looks like he wants to work with you . Wow . Maybe we are getting through to him . He only wants to meet with you , But you know I 'm not gonna let you go out there alone . Great . Let 's move . [ beeping , whirring ] [ grunting ] Welcome back , agent may . I have a few questions for you . For example , why your sudden interest in religious artwork ? Everybody has a hobby . You and your small band of S.H.I.E.L.D. Compatriots ... There can 't be many of you left . Who 's running your operation ? Where are you based ? Currently ? About five feet from kicking your ass . [ chuckles ] I don 't much believe in empty threats , agent may . I prefer promises , such as this ... You will tell me what I want to know . You have no idea what you 're starting . Perhaps . But I serve a man who has an effective way Of getting the information he wants . You will meet him soon , and you will comply . Until then ... [ electricity crackles ] [ clattering ] ... I 'll improvise . [ electricity crackles ] So , the plan . Shouldn 't be hard ... talk to talbot , see what he has to say . No , not that plan ... the other plan . Okay , the other plan , yeah . Look , I don 't like having to wait Until we 're trapped in a car to talk about this , But you haven 't left me much choice . I guess I didn 't , no . I just need to know that if things get bad with me , You can do what has to be done . Can you ? I 'm sure I can . It 's not just taking me out , may . The hard part is what happens after . S.H.I.E.L.D. Will need leadership , a new director . I trust you ... just you to do this . Do you understand ? I understand . Thank you . I won 't let you down . [ beeping ] Go . Join them . Fitz ... You won 't even talk to me now . Because it 's embarrassing . Oh , fitz . [ electricity crackling ] Well , that 's an odd sound . [ electricity powering down ] The bus is shutting down . You know what that means . We 're in trouble . We 're in trouble . [ alarm blaring ] The emergency exits are locking all over the plane . It 's the equalization stabilizers ... they 're fried . The bus thinks we made a water landing . We 're sealed in . There 's no way out . Well , who 's doing this ? We 're the only ones on the bus . This is all happening automatically . How ? Uh , I think I know . S-somebody ... We ... we 've been ... This is based on S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s equ ... tech . It means that the plane is ... the plane will ... [ electricity crackling ] ... That . The plane will explode ? Soon . [ elevator bell dings ] Hopefully , this isn 't some kind of trap talbot 's set for us . If it is , you 've got me here . Yeah . It 's been nice working together again , hasn 't it ? Just you and me , like the old days . It 's been great . You know ... [ sighs ] All this nostalgic talk has me thinking ... Maybe this will sound weird , But how about when this is over , We were supposed to get all those years back ? I thought you 'd never ask . Once this is over , I 'd like that . [ grunts ] May hates coffee . [ electricity crackling ] [ both grunting ] [ grunting ] [ thudding ] [ screams ] See ? So it 's like a ... a small disease . Virus . A virus , yes , and it 's going through ... Through the plane 's electrical systems . Yeah , blowing things up . [ electricity crackles ] The stabilizers , monitors . Yes , and the next one will be the ... The nav systems just blew . There you go . Can 't take off . Wait . Wait . Stabilizers , monitors , nav system , comms are next , And then next comes ... The wings . The wings . Where the fuel is , so then we 'll ... [ imitates explosion ] [ electricity crackles ] [ both grunting ] I lied . Working with you , whoever you are ... not that fun . [ grunting ] I won 't go down easy . That makes two of us . I can 't believe I 'm the only one seeing this right now . He 's got the painting . You good ? I 'm good . [ both grunting ] [ electricity crackles ] I thought you said you could do this . Yes , I can ... or , I mean , I know how . It 's ... it 's not ... um , it 's not just words . It 's the ... Hands , controlling them . So I can 't use these ... I have to use yours . B-b-but why does it have to be me ? Yeah , because they 're repairing the systems That have already gone boom to ... to delay the virus , And you 're the only one without , um ... Any technical skills whatsoever ? Yes . [ electricity crackles ] Super . Just tell me what to do . No , I need reinforcements now . Send them to my location and have an extraction team ready . [ gunshot ] [ both grunting ] I know all your moves . I was S.H.I.E.L.D. [ spits ] not all of them . Okay , this chip needs to go in this empty space , the ... All right , this one ? Yes . Okay . Uh ... Is that it ? Is the plane fixed now ? No . The wire ... you have to do the wires . [ both grunting ] [ knife clatters ] [ both grunting ] Uh ... This one here ? No , no ! Dear god , no . The one beside it . The one beside it . Uh , uh , to the left ? To the right . To the right . To the ... [ electricity crackling ] I think that 's a good thing . [ electricity powering up ] And now the plane is fixed . Oh . Man : Mr. Bakshi , the team is two minutes out , sir . Sir , do you copy ? [ both grunting ] Agent may , surrender , and you will find satisfaction . I get my satisfaction elsewhere . Is that I won 't have to be you anymore . If you were really me You wouldn 't talk so much . [ screams ] [ electricity crackling ] We got to go . [ elevator bell dings ] Want some help with that ? No , thank you . I need to learn to do these things by myself . Guys , drop everything . No , this is worth a fortune . I 'm not gonna drop it . Just put it down . What 's all this ? We survived a hydra attack , saved the bus . I turned out to be a genius at mechanical engineering . Calls for a celebration . I like the way you think . Um , no , actually , I should probably , um ... Fitz , this team wouldn 't be here if it weren 't for you . This is big . Let me buy you a beer , mate . We haven 't gotten to work together much yet , But I thought this was a successful mission . And if we keep up with this teamwork , There will be more successful missions And plenty more beer , plenty more ... Yeah , hey , so , um , I don 't have an ex . But there was this girl that I like , And I told her how I felt , But she doesn 't feel the same way as I do , So she left . Her loss , then , mate . From what I can see , she 's missing out . To moving on . Yeah . Moving on . Still digging ? What are you doing ? Nothing . Yeah . Nothing ? Nothing . Okay , well , if you need any help with the nothing , You just let me know . Okay . I did what , now ? I know . It 's a lot to process . I mean , a painting , coulson , And you weren 't immediately suspicious it wasn 't me ? To be fair , we 're not that close . Yeah . Well , if this is , indeed , as important as you say it is , You should probably hand it over , Along with any other hydra assets You happen to have in your possession . Sadly , the painting was destroyed in the fight . I don 't think it was of much value , anyway . Hydra was mistaken about its worth . And anything else we get , I 'll let you know . Just to be clear , this is all about a mask That this guy put on and made him look like me ? Yeah . You know , I spent five long months In an enemy war camp . You people make me miss those days . But , hey , why don 't we keep chatting On this secure line you 've hacked So I can draw a bead on your location And we can get some quality face time ? [ beep ] Some people are better in small doses . [ chuckles ] Meanwhile , now we know hydra is searching for evidence Of the alien writing . That 's not good . No , it 's not . And that 's not the worst of it . The analysis of the painting came back ... It is 500 years old . But the alien writing on the back ... brand-new . So that means someone is out there , Carving right now , someone ... Someone like me . We 'll have to find him . We will . So , um , what did she do ... fake me ? How 'd you know that she wasn 't me ? Little things . And she wanted to get coffee . Ah . Punch her in the face ? I did . Good . May ... I know you won 't come to me to make a plan . That 's why I keep coming to you . This is important . I won 't stop asking . You know I won 't . Fine . There . What is this ? Money , passports , travel tickets . I don 't have to make a plan because I already made one . I am not shooting you in the head . I will never shoot you in the head . If things go south , I 'm getting you out . I see . Where ? Tuscan villa ? Cabin in the australian outback . 'cause I like kangaroos . Point is , no matter what happens , I 'll take care of you ... that 's my plan . That is , without question , the sweetest , Most selfless thing anyone has ever wanted to do for me . But I need you to forget all that and kill me as ordered . You said it yourself ... I 'm not getting better . I don 't want to end up like garrett , And taking me to some cabin won 't change my brain . I 'll find a way . May ... Nostalgia 's fine , but then life happens . It 's time to deal with reality . Phil ... Please . Hard choices are coming . I need you to make this one ... For me . [ thunder rumbling ] We 'll return in a moment . I need to land in miami as soon as possible . Whatever route gets me there . Tonight . Yes , I 'll hold . [ sighs ] Hello , raina . I 'm daniel whitehall . You recently took something from me . Oh , the obelisk . I see what this is now . I can help you ... [ beep ] Raina , I 'm not like most of the people With whom you interact . I 'm not easily confused . I 've been around too long to lose sight of what 's mine . I generally don 't do my own dirty work anymore . We should all aspire to do only that which we enjoy , Don 't you agree ? But in your case , I will make an exception . 48 hours seems fair , doesn 't it , to bring it back to me ? I once operated on a woman on and off for a full week . The struggle really is keeping the patient awake . Pain at certain levels has a tendency To cause us to black out , And that can be incredibly frustrating . But I 'm confident I can do better now . I can find you wherever you are . Bring me the obelisk . 48 hours ... the clock starts ... [ beep ] ... Now . [ gasps ] [ breathing heavily ]

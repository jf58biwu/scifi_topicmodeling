 Help me , God ! Someone ! Hello , Ducky ! Hello , Jack ! Big bad Jack , the Ripper is not used to a woman who puts up a fight , is he ? Running away is no way to treat a lady . Never let it be said , that old Jack doesn 't know how to treat a lady . Well done , Agent Wells ! Snagging the Ripper 's Lantern in your first month . The others Agents will become jealous . They already are . Mr. Kipling 's taken to writing rude verses on the walls . I say , my dear , you 've taken to life at the Warehouse with quite aplomb . Indeed , I 've finally found a place where my others talents can be used for the good of the Empire . Oh , not just the Empire . The entire world . Great britain is simply the Warehouse 's cuttent home . England , did not house Warehouses 1 through 11 ? Not will it house Warehouse 13 . That honor belongs to another nation , when England 's power wanes . Well , then there will never be a Warehouse 13 . For the sun will never set on the British Empire . Quite right . Tea ? Wowza ! Oh , that was better than 3D IMAX . Yeah , I mean that was amazing , but why are we watching highlight reels of H.G. When she is playing happily ever aftet with , uh ... What 's-his-name in Wisconsin ? Actually they broke up . She 's now dating a woman named Giselle . Ooh ! Now that 's a highlight reel I would like to see . Now , these aren 't highlights , Agent Lattimer . This artifact is the Round Table that inspited the legend of King Arthut 's Court . Now it is the Warehouse 's Time Capsule . It stores the memory of an Agent 's defining moment with the Warehouse . Today you will all contribute . Today ? No , it 's too soon . Too soon ? What ... Too soon for what ? Agents only contribute to the Time Capsule when ... when ... Yes , Arthur . Warehouse 13 is reaching the end of its tenure . It has nothing to do with anything any of you have done . Well , wherever we are going , it 's gotta be better than South Dakota , right ? The Host 's country supplies the New Agents . It 's in the manual . How much time do we have ? Whether it 's next week ot next yeat , it 's irrelevant . Says you ! Yout job today , is to contribute to the Time Capsule . Okay , I 've got an idea . How about , instead of sitting around the mystical table of Kumbaya , we do something crazy like , I don 't know , stop it from moving . Right ? What ? I mean , come on , you guys are all thinking it . . The Warehouse is going to move . It 's a natutal order of things , not a crisis to solve . What , and you can 't stop it ? I mean , you are the Caretaker , right ? So take care of it ! Calm yourself , Agent Lattimer . Calm ? We 're talking about losing our home and you are just sitting there like some kind of ... Hey , here 's an idea . Before somebody says something they will definitely regret , how about I go first so somebody can cool off ? Good idea , Miss Donovan . So do I just think a happy thought or ... Place your hand inside the circle . The artifact will choose your defining moment . - Claudia Donovan . Next generation . That was awesome ! Shut up ! Joshua ! Mykes , how long can this thing make us tap dance ? Probably until we 're dead . Why did you activate it ? Well , I 'm sorry . I see a button and I have to push it . It 's who I am . They found us ! I used to dream about being chased by Leggy Showgirls . Oh , just shut up and dance ! Oh , what did I do in a past life to deserve this ? Oh , come on ! Okay , that 's it . No more Mr. Nice Gay . I hate musicals . - Anything ? - Yeah , well , we know that the artifact is The Marquee from the Strand Theater ... Whoa , whoa ... Where 42nd Street premiered . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Easy , Tommy Tune . Hey , guys ! So we led our girls to the Escher Vault and locked ' em in . Also , I think we 're gonna need a new Escher Vault . They 're everywhere . There 's an army of ' em in front of The Marquee too . You can 't get near it . - Well , can we destroy it ? - Yes ! Busby Berkeley 's Flask might be able to direct the original tin pan from tin pan alley to destroy the Marquee 's Bulbs . Yeah , somebody 's gonna have to recharge that Marquee . - Recharge it with what ? - Well , ironically ... whoa ! - Tap dancing . - Whoa . Somebody 's gonna have to do a big , showstopping number . Well , this thing 's tapping us to death . Who has the energy for that ? Oh , no , no , no . I 'm just B-Team . Claudia , listen to me . You 're our only hope . You may be going out there B-Team , but you 're coming back A-Team ! You can do it , kiddo ! Only not in that outfit . Your smiles don 't scare me . Okay , that 's a scary smile . Cheating ! Whoa ! I think I 'm just pissing them off . I found the flask ! Let 's go . I 'll find it . You distract them . Hi , girls . This should be a turn on , but it 's really , really not . Ow ! Artie ! I 've got it ! - Let 's go ! - Excuse me , excuse me . Here we come , Claud . Pour the Flask . Come on . Busby Berkeley was as drunk driver . It 's gonna make this tin pan swerve and hit all the lights . Okay . Claud , bring it home . Throw it ! Oh , God . My feet . And ... scene . Talk about one singular sensation . Oh , man am I gonna be sore tomorrow , but come on ! Best job ever ! Best job ever ! Claud , if that 's your defining moment , then why the sad face ? Yeah , you look like someone died . Nothing . Uh , sore feet equals sad face . No biggie . I would imagine that that was the moment you realized you didn 't want to be Caretaker after all . You w ... you ... you what ? Thanks , Mrs. F. I call them as I see them . We thought you wanted to be Caretaker . But only because you said it a lot . Yeah , guys , listen ... That day , I realized how much I love being an Agent . I mean , I can 't imagine ever giving that up . Not even to be Caretaker . - I 'm sorry . - No . You don 't have anything to be sorry about . You 're right , this is the best job in the world . The question is , why is no one else freaking out about losing it ? We are , it 's just some of us are a little quieter about it than others . Oh , well , I 'm sorry . Then someone needs to be loud about it . Look , we 're not losing the Warehouse . I 'm gonna make sure of it . Look , Artie , I know how important my destiny is to you . You don 't have to explain anything to me . We all support you , right , Artie ? I 'm must a little incredibly surprised is all . Well , it 's only human to have doubts . Right , Mrs. Frederic ? You must have had your doubts . No , I was always resolute . Thank you again . It doesn 't matter anyway . I know my responsibility . No one is forcing you . Is anyone forcing this on her ? I 'm doing it . I 'm not gonna let everyone else down and b ... The hell with everybody else . You have to do what 's right for you or you 're gonna miserable for the en ... Can I choose the memory that I want to contribute to the Time Capsule ? You want to show them that , Arthur ? It could backfire on you . You know , I 'm absolutely certain that it will . So that 's how it works . Wrong again , Arthur . Hey , when do I get one of these ? When I say so . Hold this . Did this used to be a fudge factory ? In the 1940s , this spot was an Officers ' Club . Help me lift this thing up . Okay , yeah . It is gonna be 11 : 35 in five , four , three , two , one . Wow . We 're in the past . More like the past is here . Oh , well , it makes perfect sense when you put it that way . Nothing in this job makes sense . Now pay attention . This is December 31 , 1941 . The Americans , three weeks ago , were attacked by Japan . So these guys are about to ship off to war ? Yes , and somebody here does not want this party to end . There is one man in here that is using an artifact to create a time bubble that is holding this moment in place since that night . Time bubbles and draft Dodgers . No wonder you love this job . No , God . I have been trying to snag this artifact since the ' 80s . The only problem is I can only enter here once a year . Because the artifact was put into play December 31 , 1941 at 11 : 35 P.M. ? Very good . Yes , but the Versailles Forks that keep us from being trapped here ... don 't ask . They also pop us right out of the bubble at midnight when the artifact resets time to 11 : 35 . So you can only investigate this case for 25 minutes at a time once a year ? Annoying , isn 't it ? That 's why I brought you . Fresh eyes . Now we 've only got 22 minutes . All right , so , now I 've narrowed it down to three guys who might do anything to stay here . The first guy 's over there . He 's captain Jason Fleece and he 's gonna leave behind his wife and three kids . Over there , that is Lieutenant William Drischler . He 's single , but he 's got a very sick mom . And over there sitting with that woman , that is Lieutenant Jonah Roth . He eloped with her , Laura , the day before Pearl Harbor . Let 's start with the angry guy first . Why ? Well , these other two are partying like this is their last chance , and as far as they know , it is . Look at you . All right , good . Okay . Gimme the bag . Uh , excuse me , ma 'am . I 'm special Agent Scott Mohr . I couldn 't help notice that that officer made you cry . Is everything okay ? Oh , yes . He 's my husband . I 'm just afraid he won 't come back to us . To " us ? " Oh , my . I haven 't even told Jonah . Please don 't say anything . You 're in the family way . Oh , ma 'am , you really should tell him . No . Please . He lost his brother at Pearl . He 's dead-set on going . If I told him and he stayed , why , it would tear him apart . I ... realize how difficult this is for you . You really , really don 't want him to go . Gosh , look at me blubbering in front of a complete stranger . I should get back to Jonah . Well , Roth was clean . That was weird . Generally means artifact . What ? Well , she refilled her glass three times , but I never saw her take a single sip . Oh . Thomas Wedgewood 's Champagne Glass ! How did I miss that ? Yeah , it was so obvious . Okay , we gotta go . I 'm sorry , but I gotta go . You know I gotta . I know , Jonah . I 'm sorry I got upset . I know you have to go . You also know he 's not leaving , don 't you Mrs. Roth ? - Champagne Glass , please . - What is going on ? Less than a minute . I found a way to keep you safe . Stopping time isn 't gonna keep him safe . It 's gonna keep you both trapped . You have to believe things are gonna turn out for the best . What if they don 't ? Life comes with bad times and good ones . If you stay here , you 're gonna miss ' em all . Everyone here has a future , even your baby . Baby ? Are you ... are we ... Agent Mohr . I 'm sorry , but it 's his too . Jonah , yes . 12 seconds . Honey , I don 't know what 's going on right now , but I want to meet our baby . Eight , seven , six , five , four , three ... Wow . That was ... wow . Happy new year . You did an excellent job . I am proud of you , kid . What 's the matter ? You all right ? Yeah , it just kind of hit home a little . You know , a mother afraid her baby will grow up without a father . Oh , Scott . I didn 't even think ... I 'm so sorry . - I shouldn 't have ... - No , no , no , it 's okay . You didn 't even know about me , dad . When you found out , you came back . What the what ? Dad ? Dad ? You wanna tell me about this ? Look , when I was arrested for treason , I was seeing somebody pretty seriously and ... She was pregnant . You abandoned your pregnant girlfriend . No , no , no . She never told me that she was pregnant . And as far as she knew , Arthur Weisfelt went to jail and then disappeared , and I didn 't find out about Scott till years later . He 's telling the truth . Thank you ! Now in those days , the Regents were the only ones who were granted the privilege of having a " One " . And that arrangement ... Was not gonna work for me . Arthur demanded that Agents be allowed to have a " One " with whom to share the secrets of the Warehouse or he would tender his resignation . I had to fight for my happiness , just as you have to . If you don 't want to be Caretaker ... This is all very interesting and educational , but , uh ... Claudia , you 're missing the p ... I 'm gonna have to process this . I believe that the phrase that you 're searching for is " I told you so " . Come on , Mykes , help me . Nobody knows this place like you . Okay , here it is . Great , which one 's the manual ? - All of ' em . - Oh . Yeah , it 's a lot of info . All right , well , good . Then there 's gotta be a loophole to keep the Warehouse here . Pete , I 've never read anything about keeping the Warehouse in place when it 's time for it to move . Well , you couldn 't have read it all . Not every page of every book , but come on , Pete . All right , Mykes , don 't just stand there . Come on , partner . Grab one and we 'll get this job done in no time . Pete , look , our only job today ... listen to me . Our only job today is the Time Capsule , okay ? Wow , uh ... You really don 't care , do you ? - What ? - No . You 're about to lose all of this , Myka . You 're gonna lose us . You 're gonna lose all of us , - but you ... you don 't care . - That 's not fair . No , I 'm sorry I took you away from your Warehouse 13 exit interview . Just go ahead . Go play with your Time Capsule . I 'll save the day . Fine , but when you can 't save the day , when you can 't stop this , don 't call me ! - Fine . - Fine ! - Fine ! - Fine ! I don 't wanna read all this . Because he 's a crazy old man . Yes he is . Shh , he 's here . Look , Artie , I get it . You know , I think of you as a father-like person , but you 're my boss , so , you know , whatever you choose to share or not share is really your prerogative . But you have a son that you take on Snag and Bags ! We haven 't done it in years . And he has his own full life now . When do you see each other ? He lives in San Diego . We go to Comic Con together . It 's all very normal . - Really ? - Yeah . Because none of this seems normal to me . You know , I have the best of both worlds , uh , being a father and an Agent . But why couldn 't you tell me ? Because you would have wanted to meet him . Hells yeah I would . And then you would have wanted him to be an Agent . Why not ? It looked like he knew his way around an artifact . No , the whole point of the " one " is to have them outside the Warehouse to keep us balanced . - Yeah , but ... - No , no , you see , there 's no but . There 's no but . Please , Claudia , listen to me . I 'm just trying to give you a life lesson here . What , that ignorance is bliss ? No , that in order to stay sane you sometimes have to be a little selfish . So this was your way of saying you 're not upset that I secretly don 't want to be Caretaker ? No , I 'm upset ! You shouldn 't keep secrets from me ! But ... but ... ugh ! Double standards ! Yes , do as I say , not as I do . The prerogative of a father-like person . Look , if you had just talked to me I might have been able to help you understand that you , Miss Donovan , do not have to commit to the rest of your life today . It 's not a crime to change your mind . You just have to stay true to yourself . Even if it means being a little selfish . My God , she 's been listening ! I just want you to be happy . Thank you . So really ? Best of both worlds ? Yeah , I have a great son . He 's helped me be a better father ... to you . And I have the Warehouse . Life is perfect . The Warehouse is moving . Right , well , nothing 's perfect . Really , you were there for that ? He 's too selfish to know that other people are hurting too . Our little secret . I 'm sorry , am I interrupting ? Not at all , no . Okay , well , um ... Away we go . Welcome to Warehouse 13 . Whoo ! Whoa ! I have cancer . Well , it 's all very simple when you look at the facts . Mimi 's husband had gone bankrupt , so Rachel was floating her cash in exchange for Mimi 's silence about her affair with her Spanish tutor . But Rachel 's husband already knew and had told his mistress , Carly , all about it . But Carly doesn 't keep any secrets from her other lover , Nicole . And Nicole was using one of those secrets to blackmail Maddie . About what , you may ask . Well , it turns out that Maddie has an addiction . She 's emptied their bank account buying antique Japanese ceramic art on ebay , and one such piece is the five-tailed fox , known in Japanese folklore as the elusive thief and prankster . Now , I wonder if any of you know that when Maddie touches the fox , she transforms into a Ninja Cat Burglar . And I wonder if you know that it 's not just me . That I did not know . Hey , Maddie . Do you have any more of this dip ? I mean , it is to die for . Ninjas ! Myka ! Pete ! Myka ! Ow . I think that Nicole used to be a man . Thanks for the save . I always got your back , Honey Pie . Hello . I know , right ? I got to use all of my deductive skills and kick some suburban ass . I was actually thinking how obvious it is that you have a thing for Pete . What ? A love thing . Yeah , that 's hilarious . Look at your face . No . No . No , okay ! Pete and I ... There is no Pete and I. There 's ... I mean , there 's ... Oh , my God , I 'm in love with Pete . Oh , I hate myself so much right now . Well , all good things must ... come to ... You know , what difference does it make ? It 's over . And this is how it ends ? Just over ? And what am I supposed to do ? I 'm supposed to ... Supposed to walk away ? Just walk away . You know , you give your whole life to something every day without complaining ... Well , no serious complaints ! I 'm here every day . Every day I 'm right here for you and your damn ping ... Your pings . Ping , ping , ping ! Ping , ping , ping , ping , ping ! I 'm like a slave at your Beck And Call . You know I have lost ... I have lost friends , family . People I 've loved ... Have died in my arms , but I stayed faithful . I gave you everything and now that there 's nothing left ... For you to take , you 're just gonna ... just leave . Whore ! That 's what you are , you know ! Yeah , you 're just selling out to the highest bidder . Fine ! You wanna go ? Go ! That 's what you wanna do ? Go ! You don 't want me . I sure as hell don 't want you ! En ... enjoy your new home . You think you 're gonna find somebody like me ? Somebody who cares about you like I do ? Ha ! Ha ! Good luck with that . Good luck finding somebody as devoted ! Somebody who would give their whole life ... Without a " thank you . " Without even a ... Piddling , little miniscule ... Acknowledgment that they 're appreciated . That they even matter to you ... at all . Okay then . You 're welcome . Seriously , that was Mr. Frederic ? Hey . - Hey . - What was that ? Nothing ... Uh ... I mean , it 's ... Agent Jinks , it 's your go , I believe . Oh , yeah . Can I maybe go later , or you know , not at all ? Oh , come on . Don 't go all Pete on me . We each have to do this . No , I 'm not , it 's just ... What if I don 't have a defining Warehouse moment ? Of course you do , Pookie . We all do . Let 's be honest . I have never completely belonged here . I 'm kind of our Marilyn . Munster ? Uh , no way . I 'm Marilyn . No , no , no . You are Eddie . Pete is Herman , Myka 's Lily , Artie 's grandpa , and Mrs. Frederic is ... Not really part of the pattern . Steven , why don 't we let the Warehouse decide if you belong ? There are things that you don 't know about the Regents . Why does everyone wanna talk today ? I 've come to aid you , brother . Claudia . Claudia , are you there ? Yes , Helena , thank God . For some reason , we get no reception at all in the spleen . You have got to come out . My shrinking device was only designed for three-hour intervals . If it reverses , you 'll explode right through Artie 's chest . But we found the artifact and I think we can get to it before it strikes 12 : 00 . The clock is lodged in Artie 's heart . No . It 's too dangerous to pilot the Nautilus llI into Artie 's heart . We know . Steve has a plan . It 's actually Claudia 's plan . I apparently volunteered for it . It 's our only shot . I 'll reel you back as soon as you snag it . I think I just saw a hamburger go by . Just go . Whoa . Okay , I 'm in Artie 's heart . Any sign of it ? No . I can hear it , but I can 't see it . Time 's up , you guys . Wait , wait , wait , wait . There it is up there . Steve ? Steve , are you still in the heart ? Yeah . I am . I really am . Don 't belong here , huh ? Who else could have made that shot ? Do you feel better now , Princess ? Yeah . But not because of the shot . I was inside a beating human heart . I 'd forgotten about that moment . It ... was indescribable . I ... you know , I saw it . I was there . - It was like ... - Nirvana ? You know , when I came to the Warehouse , I didn 't think that I 'd ever find peace . Just ... so much chaos , you know ? - But ... - You found it . No . No , it was given to me . The Warehouse showed it to me . That 's what today 's about , isn 't it ? I mean , th ... this Time Capsule , it 's not just for the Warehouse . No . This ritual is also the Warehouse 's gift to you . Oh , good . Pete , listen , I really need to ... What are you doing ? Look I 'm sorry , Myka , but I am not gonna let my future be decided by some glowing hunk of metal . Huh ? You hear that ? Let me see you move the Warehouse after I throw you in the furnace . Uh , Pete , listen , I have ... No , I know , I know , I know . I 'm overreacting . Yes , you are . But that 's not why I 'm here . Oh , and I 'm really sorry about what I said earlier . You 're the last person on earth that I 'd ever wanna hurt . You mean way too much to me . Well , that 's actually why I w ... But I would go crazy without the Warehouse , Myka . You know , I 've been bouncing around without a purpose - for my entire life . - Yeah , w ... I didn 't last long as a husband or a Marine - or a secret service Agent . - Have another ... I mean , come on , I 've basically been a screw-up my entire life . But here ... Here in the Warehouse , I 'm the best version of myself . - Okay , just stop ... - But if I 'm not Pete Lattimer , heroic Warehouse Agent and the partner that drives Myka Bering crazy , then who the hell am I ? Would you just shut up ? Ah . That 's very funny . Good one . But you can take off the Thimble , Steve . I 'm flattered , but I told you that 's not how I sw ... Sw ... swing . What are you doing ? No fever . Did you accidentally touch a Nympho Artifact ? Okay . Okay , Pete , look . I know you 're worried about who you 're gonna be without the Warehouse , and this is the thing . It 's ... it 's not where you are that defines you . It 's who you are . It 's the decisions that you make . I know , but I don 't wanna lose the Warehouse , and I don 't wanna lose ... Pete . Pete , you can 't lose me . It 's not possible . You can 't . Because , um ... I love you . So you ... you kissed me ? For realsies ? Yeah . So , um ... what are you gonna do about it , Lattimer ? I love you too . Wow . Listen , before we ... Uh , move in any sort of direction , - I need you to do something . - Oh , no , no , no , no . - Do not say the Time Capsule . - The Time Capsule ! Come on . You said it . You said it . Yes , I did . And you know what ? You better get used to doing what I tell you . - Oh . - Yeah . Could be good , but it could be bad . So when do we get naked ? Well , we body swapped . You 've been me naked . Oh , yeah , that was a good day . Ooh ! Oh , uh , after five years , I probably should tell you the whole punching thing ... Really turns me on . I know . Naughty . - I 'm told you read auras . - Yes . Yours is an old soul . Don 't remind me . - Just people ? - No . Objects , places . You 'll fit in quite nicely here . Yes . Some day , I 'm gonna die here . I can see it . I promise you , Leena , I will do all that I can to prevent that . You won 't be able to , but it 's all right . Okay . - Let 's do this thing . - Excuse me . Steve . Are you okay , man ? Yeah , no , I just ... just need a minute . Are we over our little tantrum , Agent Lattimer ? Oh , yeah . What 's that ? An invitation to endless wonder . - " Mica . " - Myka . - Myka ? - Myka . I 'm thrilled you 're on the team . You 're a lucky man . - You 're in tune . - What is that ? Don 't leave ! Rockin ' my world , lady . - You 're lying . - Oh , yeah . This is gonna be fun . Myka , where are you ? Hey , hey , hey . We should be safe now . Wouldn 't you rather a nice little fish ? Okay , stop . I was young . It was stupid . You 're pretty when you smile . People that make you feel safe . Wait ! Pancakes ! I 'm not gonna remember dying ? Well , it was just sitting there . Read the screen . You and Artie have gotta get out of here . What 's that ? - Ta da ! - Surprise ! Thank you . You did everything right . Stop ! Cha-cha-cha . Pete , please don 't . You are a stunningly beautiful woman . Yeah ! The time machine set us on fire ! We got a little story to tell you . Va-va-voom . Stop touching things ! And I just really love you . Mrs. F. , why was Pete 's memory of all that and not just one case . Tell them , Agent Lattimer . You know . Maybe my defining moment is all of it ... Every minute ... That I got to spend with you guys . And I 'm sorry Mrs. F. I just was scared . I was scared that if I lost this , I 'd go back to being the person I was before , and ... But this is who I am now . The Warehouse and ... And all of you have made me a better man . If it ends tomorrow or if it goes on forever , nothing ... nothing will ever change that . Or maybe you broke the table . Oh ! I 've never heard you laugh before . I am a woman of infinite surprises . Can we , uh ... Can we watch some more ? Yes , please . Uh , hang on , hang on . Yeah , I got a ping . There 's a ping . - Right . - Back to work . Let 's go . So is it really over ? I believe I 've mentioned this more than once . This particular wonder is endless . Really ? Just this once , I can 't get a straight answer out of you ? See you tomorrow , Peter . See ya tomorrow , Irene . Someone in Poughkeepsie is breathing fire ? It had to be fire , didn 't it ? - This sounds familiar . - Can you rewind that ? It looks like there 's something wrong with his skin . Wait a minute , has he got scales ? We have scales . Not at work , okay ? Never at work . Okay , this is just gonna be gross . She is not lying . Hey , we can go . I 've got an aunt in wappingers falls . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . I 've gotta stay here and start researching Artie 's son . Claudia , I 'm telling you ... No , I am ordering you ... Oh , come on , Artie . They 're practically related . So does that mean we 're going ... I 'm not the first grumpy old fart to run this place , and I won 't be the last , but I 'm the grumpy old fart running it today , so you 'll do as you 're told . I 'm not saying I won 't , Jack . I 'm just saying this place seems to take over a guy 's life . How could you even consider turning down endless wonder ? Can we focus for five seconds on this ? Relax , I 'm just asking if I can commit the rest of my life to this . - Perhaps ... - Miss Donovan . You should spend less time worrying about the future and more about the present . I didn 't hear you come in . You never will . Miss Donovan . Jack . Agent Maddox . Someone once told me it 's not a crime to change your mind . Sometimes you have to be a little selfish . I thought you said the Warehouse might be moving anyway . Jack , if I had a nickel for every time the Warehouse almost moved . Sometimes it just takes a liking to ... You all right , Miss D. ? Yes . You three just reminded me of ... Carry on . All right , back to work . All right . When you say change your mind ... I hate it when she does that . All right , if it was Obama 's Basketball ... Egyptian endless wonder . Endless wonder . It 's everywhere . A world of endless wonder . Endless wonder . Endless ... Wonder . Row after row of endless wonder . Endless wonder . Endless wonder . Endless wonder ? Endless wonder . Endless wonder . Endless ... Wonder . Au Revoir Pete , Myke , Claudia , Artie , Steve Mrs. Frederic , we all gonna miss you .

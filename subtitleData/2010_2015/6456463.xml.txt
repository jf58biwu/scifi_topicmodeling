 - Stop everything ! - What 's going on ? - Doctor , bedroom ! - We have a rule about the bedroom . No one on this planet is safe right now . We have to solve this before it 's too late . Get your clothes on ! If we move fast enough , we at least stand a chance . And you have no idea what I 'm talking about , do you ? - No . - Oh , helmic regulator again ! Too early ! Wrong point ! As you were ! Doctor , you can 't just go like that . What 's happening ? Don 't we need to know ? Popped up in the wrong order . Easy mistake to make . Nothing to alarm you , forget I was ever here . I 'll be back soon enough , I would 've thought . Everything 's fine , pretty much . Don 't worry about the future . The future 's really ... safe . Really , really safe . Sleep well . I really hate it when he does that .

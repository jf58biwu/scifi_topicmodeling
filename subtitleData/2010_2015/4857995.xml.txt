 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Hello . I have a special ... Order . - You have a date ? - No . Be yourself . So what High School did you go to ? Why all the questions about my past ? What am I doing here ? I got- - oh ! What kind of advice is " be yourself " ? Because myself is a giant freakazoid . When you said " meet me at the diner , " I thought you 'd arranged some lame meet with me and Todd . Todd . - Hey . - Hey . - Get out . - Yeah . Leaving . My lips can 't focus . I 'm too excited . Me too . I know . The Warehouse is finally getting a computer upgrade . Right . The IRS Warehouse where you work . Exciting . Very exciting . I know , right ? That place has been running on a first-gen 8-bit GUI since , like , the stone ages . Oh , I 'm so sorry . I keep forgetting you 're not a high-tech kind of guy . Hey , I 'm pumped if you 're pumped . But my computer skills go as far as getting new ring tones for my cell phone . You 're cute for a Luddite . Oh , yikes . I 'm late . Got this guy coming to install the new system . Some mucky-muck from some place called Global Dynamics . Catch up later ? I could bring lunch . Crustless PBJ , Twinkies , and Doritos ? And an orange for fiber . Mmm , that 's why I loves me some Todd . W-w-what ? What are you do- - what are you doing ? to class seven standards and I can 't do that with you constantly interrupting me . Adapt . This is not Eureka . I will not have you gutting my system . Your guts are rotted . All right , every single wire has to go exactly back where it was . Half of these aren 't even wires . This one looks like shoelace . All right , let me be perfectly clear . Hey-o ! If you damage any of my data , you will not come within an inch- - Artie , Artie , Artie , Artie . Artie ? Artie , why don 't we let our special guest , who I bet Mrs. Frederic wouldn 't have sent here if he was trouble , do his thing , huh ? Come on , buddy . Yeah , he 's a Global Dynamic geek . I know . He 's soulless . He 's made up of binary numbers . Yeah . I 'll tear his heart out . Hello ? Wire in the hole . I drop stuff down there all the time . Hold on to me , will you ? I 'm Claudia , resident tech girl . Uh , Douglas . Douglas Fargo . Everyone just calls me Fargo . Okay ... Doug . Neat gizmo , huh ? Yeah . Um , what makes it glow ? Is it , like , a phosphorous compound ? No , it belonged to Ben Franklin . Amplifies human energy to- - first time in the Warehouse ? Until the scary lady with the beehive showed up , I kind of thought Warehouse 13 was just an Internet rumor . So , um , any chance after I 'm done with the install , I could get a tour ? Ooh , no can do , outlander . You 've only got blue level clearance . I have to ask . Is this- - gasp . Better than gasp . This is gonna replace all of that . It 's from Global Dynamics , where I work . Well , run , I guess . Yeah , I 'm in charge . What about this thing ? Ah , it 's a M.A.R.A. A maintenance and repair automaton . It 's for use in unmanned space stations , large facilities . I--I actually invented it . But , um , I was gonna install it with your system , but your boss vetoed it . Yeah , Artie would have vetoed fire if he 'd been born just a couple years earlier . So you ready to fire up Warehouse 13.1 or what ? Let 's get this over with . Okay , shutting down the old systems now . And bring in the new . Anybody gonna ask me to dance ? What exactly did you do ? The new O.S. should have come right on . Oh , really ? I hope that means we can 't park here . Catastrophic failure detected . " Catastrophic " is a bad word . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x05 ♪ 13.1 Original Air Date on August 3 , 2010 Those eyes are popping up all over the Warehouse . Is this thing looking at me ? And what are they doing ? I think they 're watching us . This is all your fault , Bismarck . Fargo . And it is not my fault . When we shut down the old system , some sort of fail-safe activated . I 'm completely locked out . You didn 't think to mention there was a fail-safe ? No , I didn 't know there was a fail-safe . And aren 't so-called computer experts supposed to realize that before you shut down a system ? Okay , boys , take it outside . Let me work a little Claudiosity . I never should have let you in here . Well , it wasn 't exactly your decision now , was it ? Hey . Oh , no , you didn 't . It 's not coming from this office . All systems functioning within acceptable parameters . That voice . I recognize that voice . That 's Hugo Miller 's voice . Who ? He was the original designer of the Warehouse systems . Where are you going ? Um , the computer lab . You have a computer lab ? More like a computer morgue . You didn 't think to mention there was a computer lab ? Well , later on , I 'll make a list for you of all the things that I didn 't think to mention . Has this been running the entire time ? No , no , of course not . Place has been shut down for 35 years . So why is it- - you know what ? Spread out , don 't touch anything , but look for an off switch . Who was Hugo Miller ? Brilliant man and more than a little devious . He actually encouraged Bill Gates to go in one direction while pushing Steve Jobs to go in another . Hey . Hey . Hugo spent years down here integrating the whole Warehouse into a workable platform . Looks like he spent a lot of time playing with himself too . No way ! Awesome . Lemon launch . Pete . Pete , that 's been here for years . If I were you , I 'd put that down . Hugo was a huge practical joker . He 'd leave exploding cans of pop everywhere . Used to drive everybody nuts . Artie , what happened to him ? He retired . Hello , blinky . Oh , that 's the fail-safe . There must be a main power junction . Oh ! You all right ? I 've been hit with worse . Are you sure ? Wow , this thing is tied in to the fail-safe . Whoa . Take a gander . It 's uploading a massive amount of data from our mainframe . Whatever it is , I think it 's moving in . This fail-safe is hardwired into the whole system , into the temperature regulators , the security feeds , into the neutralizer pump . Maybe that 's okay . We were installing a new computer anyway . Well , one we can control . Why don 't we just bring Hugo Miller here ? I told you he 's retired . Retired or ... No , he 's alive . Don 't be dramatic . There were rumors about a nervous breakdown , but- - well , sitting in a windowless room for ten years playing Monopoly with Hal ? What could go wrong ? Do we know where he retired to ? Place called Hutchinson . It 's in Featherhead . Featherhead ? That 's two hours away . We should at least go talk to him . It 's worth a try . Yeah , I think I could " retire " here . Well , let 's check you in then . Hugo doesn 't get many visitors . Just give me a moment . Okay . I wonder if they give sponge baths here . Do you know every former Warehouse Agent we 've ever known is either crazy , evil , or dead ? Or all three . You can come in now . Mr. Miller , we 're from the- - I know who you are . You 're President Ulysses S. Grant and the snowman . You 've come because it 's Arbor Day and there aren 't enough zippers to go around . Well , at least he 's not evil or dead . Yet . Hugo ? We have some questions about something you built years ago . A , um , backup computer system ? It went round and round and spinning and spinning and dancing and flying . This is not gonna be a standard interview . No . No , it 's not . The Koala Bear is actually a Marsupial . Well , system 's functioning within acceptable parameters . Recovery fail-safe is active . Yes , Hugo . Exactly . Exactly . The fail-safe . How do we shut it off ? You don 't have the code . Agent Miller , President Grant is ordering you to give us the code . Of course , Mr. President . But I must be paid in bicycles . Can do . Mm-hmm . I 'm not paying a bicycle for that . You know , maybe we should just take him back to the Warehouse . Warehouse 13 ? Yeah , yeah . You remember Warehouse 13 ? The spinning and the dancing ... And--and the boxes . If he sees the Warehouse , he may remember the code . What do you think about that , buddy , huh ? Can we get ice cream ? Uh- - yeah . Yeah , if that 's what you want . Definitely . Ice cream . Okay . Ice cream . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Whoa , Hugo . Hey ! No . We got everything on Hugo Miller . Excellent . Is it hard to find ? Uh , yes and no . Okay , perfect . All we have to do is go through and follow- - redacted . Who would do that ? The Regents . Crossing things out . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . They found Hugo collapsed on aisle Allentown-22C . Cited it as mental exhaustion . Uh , guys , it 's finishing . Please don 't blow up . Oh , that wasn 't so bad . No , we 're still locked out . Is that- - Hugo . It 's Agent Miller . Agent Nielsen , I am Hugo One . I assume control in the event of catastrophic failure . Holographic artificial intelligence . Must be one of the earliest models ever . That would explain the Tom Selleck mustache . We were just installing a new system . There is no catastrophic failure . I will be the judge of that . The judge ? My eyes are currently scanning the Warehouse for irregularities . I must also review decades of artifact retrieval and personnel files . Excuse me . At least he is polite . Artie , look , we found Miller , okay , but he 's a complete nutjob . He kept talking about spinning and dancing and- - he Tesla 'd us , Artie . Well , his program is some kind of artificial intelligence . Bring him back here so he can turn this thing off . Yeah , he kind of slipped away from us , so we 'll call you back when we get him . This is very unusual . He 's normally quite docile . We 've checked . He 's not on hospital grounds . Here are his records you asked for . Thank you . You know , Myka ? Yeah ? This guy couldn 't have spun or danced far . Spinning and dancing , right ? On the way here we saw a- - I think I might know where he is . What ? What ? What ? What did we solve ? ♪ ♪ Hugo , are you okay ? So sad . It worked last time . Hey , Hugo ? Hey , buddy . I 'm gonna put these bright , shiny bracelets on you , okay ? And you can tell us all about it on the way to the Warehouse . Yeah ? Come on up . Yeah , let 's do this one first . Hugo , we really need your help . Can 't help without the spinning . So why would he model Hugo One after himself ? Lots of programmers do that . I mean , I never have . Some others do . But this is impossible . When this was developed , A.I. was just science fiction . If something seems impossible , it usually means there 's an artifact involved . He 's coming back . I have completed my analysis . And everything 's cool , right ? So you can skedaddle . Claudia Donovan , your file shows nine separate incident reports . Actually thought it would be more . I guess he 's got your number . Douglas Fargo , your Global Dynamics profile includes the phrase " inappropriately pushed button " 38 times . Wait , wait , wait . You can access my G.D. file ? No , no , no . He 's accessing the Warehouse system . If I can view an ATM in Sweden , for example , then so can Hugo One . Agent Nielsen , your unconventional management skills are subpar . Okay , I 've had just about enough of you . I have determined the source of the recent catastrophic event . Which is ? The agents who work here . I have completed my analysis . Todd ? Hey . Where are you ? The doritos are getting cold . Shoot . Uh , I 'm sorry . Got a bit of an emergency here . I am gonna have to resched lunch . Oh , okay , no problem . Maybe dinner ? Oh , God , I hope so . Who 's that ? Nobody . I 'm nobody ? No , you 're Todd . This is Todd . I can 't talk right now . Who is that ? Nobody . I 'm nobody ? No . I can--I can 't do this . I 'm gonna have to call you- - External communications are for Warehouse business use only . Maybe a bad idea anyway . So who 's Todd ? A guy . A friend . A guy friend . It 's not serious . Why ? Oh , yeah , no particular reason . I just kind of got the impression that- - yeah , just call her when your voice has changed , will you ? Work to do . Hugo One , I think that your calculations are incorrect . The agents are not the problem here . Falcon Scott protocol initiated . No , no , no . Please . You can 't be serious . Protecting the Warehouse is my primary function . No , no . What 's Falcon Scott protocol ? Well , the system initiates a temperature drop to sub-zero to protect the artifacts . And what happens to us ? Ooh ! Oh , that was fast . ♪ Round and round the mulberry bush ♪ ♪ the monkey chased the weasel ♪ anything useful in that file about our Lawrence Welk back there ? It 's weird . There 's a recent neuro-imaging of his brain and it shows that there 's a whole section of it that 's completely dormant and there 's no explanation why . I need to shed a tear . Don 't we all ? I think he means he needs to go to the bathroom . What ? Yeah . My Uncle used to say that . Hugo , okay , you hold it , okay ? I just got this baby detailed . There 's a gas station down the road . Jeez , it 's cold in here . You think by saying that every three minutes it 's gonna get any warmer ? Got about an hour left before it becomes life-threatening . And where are you taking us ? We got to figure- - I didn 't catch that . What the hell- - You took off his cuffs ? He likes to sit . That 's not in my job description . Ice cream . Not now , Hugo . That 's what it was like in the bathroom . Fine . You know what ? Grab me some twizzlers . I 'm gonna call Artie and see what 's up . Artie , I can 't understand you . Albert grows things . Huh ? Yeah , he 's had a long day . Just keep the change and thank you . Okay , Artie , slow down . Well , there 's a new one . I think the Farnsworth is broken . Babble , babble , babble . Okay , Artie , I don 't know if you can hear me , but I read through Hugo 's medical file and half of his brain is burnt out . " Bring Hugo back . Computer has taken over . " What ? Okay , we have to get back there now . All right , buddy , we 're going for a ride . Be on the lookout for two kidnapping suspects . If you see either of these two people , you are supposed to contact the police immediately . Suspects are wanted in connection- - Gonna have a little chat with Hugo One . Lattimer and Bering ? That 's what I thought . Hands above your heads . Hey , pal , you 're making a mistake . Don 't push me , cowboy ! Or we could just raise up our hands . Yeah . Don 't you have any artifacts that make it warmer ? Increases elasticity , makes pigeons dance . Nothing here . I don 't get it . How is any of this dangerous ? Oh , trust me , if it 's been snagged , bagged , and tagged , it 's got an evil streak . So ... Todd , is he your boyfriend ? Guy friend . Okay , boyfriend . He 's nice . What about you ? Girlfriend ? Used to . She , um , doesn 't exist anymore . Oh , when you break up , you really break up . I 'm new to the whole dating meme . I mean , I like Todd , but he thinks I work in a tax warehouse , so it 's not like I can say , " hey , sorry I can 't make our date . An evil computer took over my workplace . " Be nice if I could just have someone in my life I could be honest with like you . Yeah , nice . Ooh . Hey , a Zoetrope . I used to have one of these when I was a kid . Yeah , that one probably makes you- - Fargo , no ! Think I just saw your whole life flash before my eyes . And ? Was that a genie costume ? No . " Max Wertheimer 's Zoetrope . Allows for mind transference . " Get out . Wertheimer ? Wertheimer . He was the Gestalt guy in the ' 20s . He pioneered the study of the brain 's thought processes . I spent some time in a psyche w--research facility . Hey , wait a second . Myka said Hugo kept talking about spinning and dancing . Unauthorized removal of artifact . Security measures engaged . Those are my M.A.R.A.S. Hugo One 's been playing with your toys . They 're just for maintenance and repair though , right ? Mostly . Oh ! Whoa . Nice ! Run ! Don 't move . Cops are on their way . Okay , look , Leo ... I think you 're kind of stepping in it here , bro . I mean , the thing is , we 're kind of in a hurry . Yeah , no kidding , pretty boy . I saw you on the APB . You 're wanted for kidnapping . Probably that guy , right ? The A.I. It must have accessed the Internet through the Warehouse . You think it doesn 't want us to bring Hugo back ? Look , Leo , you 're making a huge mistake , 'cause we 're Secret Service . Look , I 'm just gonna reach for my badge slowly and I 'm gonna throw it over to you and just take a look at it . This looks real . That 's because it is real , Leo . But the Secret Service protects the President . Yeah , and the President 's nowhere else around here ! Not as stupid as you thought , huh ? Hey , hey , hey . What ? Soda pop go " boom . " Pete , are you okay ? What 's he talking about ? I don 't know . Blast off with lemon launch . Remember ? Ahem . Huh ? Hugo makes his own lemony launches . Houston ... We have a problem . What 's wrong with him ? Do not get me started . Hugo , doesn 't Leo look thirsty ? What a lark ! Look out ! That 's it ? What the hell ? Billy Jack ! What did you think was gonna happen with the can of soda pop ? What ? The guy built a computer that can have us arrested . I thought his practical jokes would do more than make the floor sticky . Ha-ha ! Sticky ! You wanted to chat ? God , I hate that ! I intercepted Donovan and Fargo attempting to remove an artifact from Allentown-22C . But you didn 't hurt them , right ? The dropping temperatures will soon preclude any further breaches of protocol . Bully for you . I 'm very happy for you . Listen , Hugo One , I was thinking , you know , while we 're waiting for me to take the big sleep , that you and I- - I don 't know--we could pass the time maybe by playing a game . Attempting to distract me with games is futile . No , I know . I know . But come on , Hugo . Come on . You can 't resist playing a game . Any game . I know you can 't . Does that work ? No ! Stupid M.A.R.A.S. We can 't stay in here forever . We can stay until the- - Until that thing wakes up . Out , out , out ! We got to get out . Was that the original- - don 't say its name . Trust me on this . It can get ugly . All right , come on . We 're the two biggest techno brains in the Dakotas and we 're totally getting our asses kicked by colossus . That ring you have , can it amplify anything other than human energy ? Like for instance ? For instance ... A laser ? Marry me . D-9 . No . Miss . E-10 . Hit . Ahh . You sunk my battleship . Sorry . A-7 . Miss again . If this works , we 'll probably only have a few seconds before it drains the cutter 's charge . Hey , if we die , it 's been fun . Agreed . Awesome . Fargo , watch out . It is my destiny . 20 years of practicing in front of the mirror for the best four seconds of my life ! We rule ! I like Todd . I had a completely different thought . No , I mean- - I 'm really sorry . I like you , Fargo . I do , but when we kissed , I was totally thinking of Todd . I really like him . He 's not just some guy . He 's the guy I think about when I impulsively kiss guys I 've just met . We 're still cool , right ? Yeah . Totally . Okay , good . Let 's find that Zoetrope and get it to Artie . This is why Jedi turn to the dark side . Come on , Hugo . Okay . Artie 's here . Yes , yes . He is--he is here . Come on . Let 's go see Artie . What 's wrong ? It won 't open . Tick-tock , change the lock ! Oh , man . I knew this was gonna happen some day ! The computers have taken over . Step one , kill Pete and Myka . Step two , unleash the nuclear arsenal and then , bam ! Pretty soon we 're all in human breeding camps wearing fur bikinis . You know , sometimes I think your brain is the artifact . It 's just a program , Pete . Computers can 't think for themselves , all right ? Mine does . Okay . E-3 . Hit . You 've won , which is impossible . Well , not when you 've played the way I have . See , I never put any of my battleships on the board . You cheated . You know what I think ? I don 't think that you 're artificial intelligence . You 're Hugo Miller . Part of him , anyway . Pete and Myka have the other part , don 't they ? You- - you don 't know anything about me . Well , I think I know more about you than you do yourself . I know that you loved wearing those hideous leisure suits . And I know you had a fat , orange cat . And I know that you always cheated at games . Used to drive everybody completely crazy . And for some reason , the part of you that loves games is still in there , and the part of you that cheated is not . Hugo , what the hell happened ? Full programming was discontinued by the Regents . Deemed too dangerous . But the potential for human-computer interface is invaluable to the scientific community . And so you took a shortcut . You cheated . You used an artifact . I may have miscalculated . Instead of copying my electro-encephalographic waves , it transferred them . Half of Hugo 's brain didn 't burn out . It 's in the computers . Or the left side , anyway . Compassion and intuition , improvisation , that 's still in Hugo 's body . Hugo , you can 't run the Warehouse with half a brain . I mean , look . I was able to trick you at a child 's board game . Let Pete and Myka come back to the Warehouse with the real Hugo ... And let us try to put your brain back together . Oh , man , I 'm really starting to hate these things . Well , hello . No , no , Hugo . No , no , no , no , no , no . That 's a bad sound . Pete , I really think that we should just- - I don 't know ! Take cover ! Take cover ! Go ! Get down ! Get down ! Get down , Hugo ! Artie ? Artie , we got it . Max Wertheimer 's Zoetrope . Hugo Miller could have used this to copy his brain into Hugo One . It 's why he was able to create such a sophisticated A.I. 25 years ago . Except that he 's not an A.I. And it 's not a copy . That 's really half of Hugo Miller 's brain in there , which is why he can 't function as a full human being . Right , Hugo ? Your argument has merit . The right side of my brain should be reconnected with the left , but not in human form . Inside the computer . No . You 'll be trapped in there . The human body fails after a few years . Computers are forever . He has a point . If I help you , then what do I get ? I shall lift the restrictions and abort Falcon Scott protocol . Lattimer and Bering may return to the Warehouse with Miller and complete the transference . If you do this , you know you 'll be killing the real Hugo Miller ? No . The real Hugo Miller will become his life 's work . All right , okay , Hugo . That thing 's firing freaking laser beams at us , man ! Pa-cheew ! Ah ! We have to get past that eye . Where is the Tesla ? Oh , it 's in the car . I 'll get it . Be careful . Be careful . Ah ! Okay . Okay , but it 's not fully charged ! All right , well , it 's our only shot . Well , I 'm a better shot , so I should take it . Bull . Okay . Ah ! It 's gone . Hugo ? Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Wait , wait , wait . Hugo , you go first . Pete ! What ? Just- - all right , I 'll go . Artie , you can 't do this . I know . It 's just Hugo One has left us no option . So , what , this lamp thing is gonna suck out the rest of this poor guy 's brain ? Yes . The Warehouse comes first . We all knew that going in . Hello there . Wait . That 's ... Hugo . What ? Yeah , I 'll explain later . Shall we begin ? No , no . Artie , we 're not gonna feed a former Agent to some pissed off Atari . No , no , no , Pete ! What the hell are these things gonna do ? What the hell are those things gonna do ? Nets , fire , I don 't know . Whoa ! Ah ! Or spinning blades . No , no , no , no , no . No , it 's okay , guys . I got it . Just stay back there and don 't make it angry . Hugo , that is not necessary . We will do exactly as we 've agreed . Thank you . Until the procedure is complete , all systems will remain on automatic . You will continue to be locked out of any access . Guys , uh , could you please hurry , 'cause I already shaved once today ? Please connect the Zoetrope to the fail-safe . Claudia . I 'm sorry . The spinning . Begin . Artie , we can 't . You have to stop this . There 's a person in there . All right , now . Now what ? Well , the lights are dimmed . Yeah , and ? That 's exactly what happened when Hugo One- - was first turned on . So now we 've got a shot because- - because the transfer might be taking up most of his processing power . Yes . We might be able to get back into the system . Exactly . You can remotely access the Warehouse through your laptop ? I hacked in from Switzerland once . Sweet . Guys , we 're losing him ! There 's a pass code . Crack it ! It 's six digits or letters . I 'm counting on your hackery . I need more than eight seconds . Ah ! Myka , the picture ! He gave us this code when we visited him . He drew a picture of a cat . Ooh , he had a fat , orange cat . What was the name of the cat ? Fatty , catty , orangey . Orangey ! Try orangey ! No go . " Orangey " ? Really ? Albert ! Albert ! It 's Albert ! How do you know that ? 'Cause we went in that store and Hugo said , " Albert grows things . " Name of his cat is Albert . I 'm in . Yes ! All right , lock him out of everything but this lab . Illegal access . Disengage . Oh , boo-hoo . Time to set things right . What are you all doing in my office ? Hugo ... You don 't remember ? Remember what ? I was in the middle of a procedure and I- - oh . Oh , wha- - what the hell is this ? What ? Wha- - Hugo , buddy , we got a little story to tell you . Let 's go get some ice cream . I can 't . I 'm lactose intolerant . Ooh . What ? Do you ever think about our future here ? Like , how do we not end up with our brains scrambled or blown up or whatever new way to die there could be ? Well , I mean , look at the bright side . I 'm usually within ten feet of you , so whatever terrible thing happens to you will probably happen to me too . Comforting . You know , when we play rock , paper , scissors , you don 't always have to pick rock . I don 't always pick rock . Yes , you do . All right , next time I will pick scissors . See , you shouldn 't have told me that . And that should do it . All the most recent patches and upgrades . Ah , I cannot wait to see all the technical achievements I 've missed . Did Billy Gates ever get that project of his off the ground ? Um , in a way . You will love Eureka . We have a brain-mapping project so up your alley , it has a parking space . Yeah , if things don 't work out in Eureka , please consider coming back to be with us . Oh , thanks , but I really couldn 't leave Eureka . Not you . I 'm so glad you 're back . Thank you , Agent Nielsen . Oh , just call me Artie . Artie . Artie ? Yeah . Wait . Artie ! Yeah . We used to play battleship together . Yes . You hated computers . Yeah , and still do . Maybe there is no such thing as evolution . You and me and MacPherson , we have to get together . Well , that would be nice , but there aren 't as many of us from the old days as there used to be . Ahh . Hugo . Artie . Good luck . I got it . Hey . Hey . Thank you for coming . I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry we got cut off earlier . Something huge came up and I- - it 's okay . Um , listen , there 's something I need to tell you . Me too . Um , look , I 'm sorry I 've been such a flake lately . My head 's been in a weird place , but I recently got some clarity . I don 't think it 's a good idea for me to see you anymore . I 'm sorry .

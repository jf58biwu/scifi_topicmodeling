 DR. DEXTER : As your doctor , I 'm having you continue this with the pharmacist . DR. DEXTER : But as yourfriend , I 'm asking you to meet me halfway . DR. DEXTER : The first step towards any real progress is communication , Robert . DR. DEXTER : And that 's a two-way street ... Ineed your help . DR. DEXTER : You ' re not just a patient . DR. DEXTER : I made a promise to your Mother ; one I intend fully to keep . DR. DEXTER : Anytime , day or night , you need to talk , you call me. I 'll be there for you . LANDLADY : Three-thirty , back from the druggist ; I can set my watch by you . LANDLADY : And pays his rent on time , just like clockwork . LANDLADY : I wish all my tenants could be like you . LANDLADY : You ' re a good , reliable man . That 's hard to find these days . LANDLADY : All those pills you take . That 's not what you need . LANDLADY : The druggist doesn ' t have your cure . LANDLADY : What you need is a good woman . LANDLADY : I want you to meet my niece . LANDLADY : She 's coming here from New York . LANDLADY : She 'd be good for you . She 's pretty . LANDLADY : She doesn ' t have any friends either . And she 's a good cook . LANDLADY : She 'd make you a good healthy dinner ... LANDLADY : Okay ? PlCKMAN : Alright ... ART DEALER : Twelve noon , right on the dot . Are you ever late , Mr. Pickman ? ART DEALER : I have good news for you . ART DEALER : I got you another commission , a bed and breakfast out in the country . ART DEALER : This old lady is redoing her guestrooms and wants several paintings to match her new wallpaper . ART DEALER : I got herto commit to six . Six ! ART DEALER : That will pay both of our rents for the rest of the year . ART DEALER : But I can ' t take any credit ; it 's never been hard to sell a Pickman . ART DEALER : You have quite a knack for painting those Lighthouses and Seascapes . These old ladies love you . ART DEALER : Here are the swatches forthe wallpaper , so you can match the colors . ART DEALER : What 's this ? This isn ' t the painting we discussed . ART DEALER : I know this painting . ART DEALER : This was the one rejected by that decorator - - and rightly so . ART DEALER : This isn ' t your normal work . Look at these brush strokes ... ART DEALER : ... very amateurish , and there 's no soul , no emotions ... ART DEALER : My God , Pickman ; that was over a month ago . ART DEALER : Do you mean to tell me you haven ' t painted anything new since then ? ART DEALER : This is our livelihood , Pickman . ART DEALER : This puts us way behind . Ashcroft is expecting four paintings , and he 's not a patient man . ART DEALER : What am I supposed to tell him ? PlCKMAN : Fine ! Tell him I can ' t do it anymore . ART DEALER : Robert . ART DEALER : Alright , Robert , I 'm sorry . Maybe I 've been overworking you a bit . ART DEALER : It 's just that the money has been so good . ART DEALER : Alright , take some time away . I 'll stall Ashcroft for a week ortwo ... ART DEALER : Travel ; go on vacation ; see some new sights . PlCKMAN : What 's the point ? It all looks the same ... no ? ART DEALER : Oh , God ... DR. DEXTER : Robert ? It 's Ambrose Dexter . PlCKMAN : What do you want ? LANDLADY : I 'm so sorry . Your doctorthought you might be needing help . DR. DEXTER : Robert , You missed two appointments . I was concerned. I was worried . PlCKMAN : I 've been working . LANDLADY : I 'm very sorry , Mr. Pickman . We 'll be leaving you now . DR. DEXTER : Working ... ? Robert , you ' re painting again ? DR. DEXTER : That 's wonderful ! What brought you around ? PlCKMAN : Doc , ljust don ' t have time to get into it right now ; I have to get back to work . LANDLADY : Yes , of course . Sorry to have disturbed you . DR. DEXTER : Well , Robert , you know I 'm the last man in the world that would everwant to stop you from getting back to work ... DR. DEXTER : But , when you have the time , come on in and make an appointment ... DR. DEXTER : You know there 's always room for you in my schedule . PlCKMAN : Yes. I will . ART DEALER : Well , I 'll be . What are you doing here today , Mr. Pickman ? This isn ' t your usual appointment . PlCKMAN : I need money for more paint and canvases and supplies and stuff . PlCKMAN : Look . Can you sell this ? ART DEALER : Interesting . Where did you get this , Mr. Pickman ? PlCKMAN : What do you mean ? It 's mine . ART DEALER : Yours ? PlCKMAN : Yeah. I painted it . ART DEALER : You ' re joking with me . PlCKMAN : No . ART DEALER : This isn ' t anything like yourwork . ART DEALER : I 'd swearthis was the work of Goodie Hines . PlCKMAN : No. lt 's my work . ART DEALER : I 've seen my share of recreations of Goodie 's work ... ART DEALER : but this , by far , is the best I 've ever seen . PlCKMAN : No , no , no . This is not a recreation . PlCKMAN : This is an example of my new stuff , my new work . PlCKMAN : I don ' t even know who Goodie Hines is ... ART DEALER : Don ' t you ever read the papers ? " The Vicious Visionary " , " The Painter of Pain " . ART DEALER : The media had a field day with him . ART DEALER : You really should keep up with the news . He killed and mutilated seven people . ART DEALER : He cut their eyes out while they were still living . He said they begged him to do it . PlCKMAN : I 'm sure they did ... I still don ' t know who he is . ART DEALER : You should . He 's up at County Hospital with your Dr. Dexter . ART DEALER : Ambrose Dexter is your doctor , right ? PlCKMAN : Yeah . ART DEALER : He never mentioned Goodie ? PlCKMAN : No ! I don ' t even know why he would . ART DEALER : Your Doctor kept Goodie from getting the Chair . ART DEALER : Sometimes I think you live in a bubble . You know that , Robert ? . PlCKMAN : Maybe I do. ljust came by for supplies ... ART DEALER : Ever since all that horrible business ... ART DEALER : I 've got people coming in here all the time trying to pass off imitations of Goodie 's work ... ART DEALER : ... especially of the church . ARTDEALER : This is the best example I 've seen . ART DEALER : And you ' ve never seen one of Goodie 's paintings ? PlCKMAN : Ijust don ' t know how many times I can tell you - - no . ART DEALER : That 's simply amazing . Well , I want to show you something . PlCKMAN : Show me what ? ART DEALER : One of Goodie 's works , of course. I 've got one of the last ones . ART DEALER : Managed to get one before they locked them all up as evidence . ART DEALER : And I 'm going to retire on that sale when the time 's right . PlCKMAN : I don ' t have time right now. ljust need the supplies ... ART DEALER : I 'll take care of your supplies . But come on , I want to show you this . ART DEALER : I 'm embarrassed to say it , but those murders were a real boon for sales . ART DEALER : You know what they say : Nothing improves the price of an artist 's work more than death , or insanity . ART DEALER : I had a feeling something was not right with Goodie when he starting signing his paintings differently . ART DEALER : Strange little thing , really ; he began connecting the two O 's in Goodie like the sign for infinity . ART DEALER : Yep . Amazing piece of work , isn ' t it ? ART DEALER : Say what you want about the material , but no one has a right to deprive the art community of such work . PlCKMAN : I 've never seen anything like this . ARTDEALER : This is one of his last pieces . His most radical change in style . ART DEALER : Don ' t stare at it too long ; it 'll give you one hell of a headache . ART DEALER : Something he does with the angles , the way they are all wrong like that . ART DEALER : You ' ll get a pain in your head a handful of aspirins won ' t get rid of - - trust me . ART DEALER : Hideous and beautiful all at the same time - - isn ' t it ? PlCKMAN : I 'd give anything to paint like this . ART DEALER : He had such an incredible imagination . ART DEALER : No matter how horrible the image , you feel as if you know it , or should know it . PlCKMAN : Like a forgotten nightmare ... ART DEALER : Look at the faces of the victims . ART DEALER : The anguish is so real , and every inch of that strange landscape holds a weight to it , a truth . ART DEALER : As if it were drawn from a photograph and not pulled from his imagination . ART DEALER : As if he were there . ART DEALER : He would go on and on about anotherworld that he said he was able to look upon through a secret window . ART DEALER : He was painting like an out of control fire . ART DEALER : At times I almost though the was afraid of what would happen if he should stop ... ART DEALER : But nothing kept him from getting his worlds onto canvas . ART DEALER : Even when he ran out of supplies , he found a way ... ART DEALER : When he ran out of canvases , he simply painted overwhat was his first obsession ... PlCKMAN : It 's the church ... The church on Federal Hill . ART DEALER : It 's almost like a watermark for any of Goodie 's final work . GUARD : Dr. Dexter , I 'm glad to see you . I 've been paging you . DR. DEXTER : is Doctor Meyer alright ? . GUARD : Yes . DR. DEXTER : Was he with Goodie Hines ? GUARD : He 's still down there . DR. DEXTER : I was in the otherwing . The orderly told me ... . Are you all right ? richard : Yes. I 'll be fine . richard : It 's just a scratch ; it 'll heal . richard : I 'm not so sure about my pride . DR. DEXTER : What happened ? richard : I wasn ' t paying attention . I was concentrating on my notes , and I let Goodie get too close ... richard : He managed to get my fountain pen from me . DR. DEXTER : Oh , Richard .. ! richard : I know , I know. I feel so foolish . DR. DEXTER : That 's all I need today , Goodie Hines with a pen . DR. DEXTER : You know how hard it 's going to be to get that pen from him ? DR. DEXTER : We might as well be trying to unscrew all his limbs . richard : I 'm sorry. I feel like a first year resident . DR. DEXTER : No , the important thing is you ' re all right . DR. DEXTER : I want you to get down to the infirmary and have that hand cleaned thoroughly . DR. DEXTER : We 'll take care of this ... DR. DEXTER : Get nurse Julie . She 's good with sedatives . Lithium . GUARD : She 's already on the way . richard : Are you sure ? DR. DEXTER : It 'll be fine . Go to the infirmary . richard : And don ' t think about keeping that pen ... richard : It was a gift from my fatherwhen I got my degree . DR. DEXTER : I 'll get the pen . I might ask forthe degree back . richard : Ouch , that hurt doctor . DR. DEXTER : It was meant to ... DR. DEXTER : Goodie , we can ' t let you keep that pen . DR. DEXTER : We need him sedated and restrained . GOODlE : Don ' t take it away from me ! Don ' t take it away ! GOODlE : I can draw you the truth ! GOODlE : I can draw you all the forgotten gods and forgotten places that man refuses to see ... GOODlE : Let me draw it for you ! Let me draw it for you ! Let me draw it for you .. ! VOICE ..

DEXTER : Tell me exactly what happened . niece : My Aunt brought me up to introduce me to Mr. Pickman . niece : She said he was a good man . niece : But a good man would never paint those places . niece : My Aunt cursed at him when she saw those " things " he had painted . niece : Horrible , horrible places . niece : The angles were all wrong ... niece : ... and they made me dizzy to look at them . niece : But they looked so real . niece : I don ' t know how someone can imagine those kinds of nightmares . niece : I called the police . niece : No one should allow what he has done . niece : Please don ' t look at those paintings , for your own good . niece : I am so afraid . niece : I 'm afraid I won ' t be able to forget what I 've seen . policeman : Look , I need you to understand , there is nothing I can do ! policeman : He hasn ' t broken any laws .

PlCKMAN : You don ' t like it , you don ' t have to look at it . LANDLADY : Ignoring sin is more of a sin than sin itself . LANDLADY : Turning a blind eye , this is how evil is able to slowly creep into this world . LANDLADY : Don ' t you see what he 's brought in here ? LANDLADY : Why don ' t you do something ? ! policeman : There 's nothing we can do . policeman : By law he hasn ' t done anything wrong .

DR. DEXTER : Why would they do something like that ? . girl : They try to show each otherthey 're not scared . DR. DEXTER : Scared ? Of the Church ? DR. DEXTER : You girls don ' t believe in ghosts - - do you ? girl : Not ghosts , something worse . girl : The boys put that thing in the yard to make fun of their religion . girl : Guess it looks like some of the stuff they used to pray to in there . DR. DEXTER : I don ' t understand . DR. DEXTER : What does that thing in the yard have to do with a Catholic Church ? girl : It 's not a Catholic Church anymore . girl : It hasn ' t been for like a hundred years . girl : They sold it off . DR. DEXTER : Who bought it ? girl : Whoeverthey were , they didn ' t pray to God in there . girl : That 's why they got run off a long time ago . girl : No one wants anything to do with the place . girl : I think it 's betterto just leave it alone . DR. DEXTER : You really think people are that scared of the place ? girl : Sure . Can ' t you tell by just looking at it ? girl : Hadn ' t you noticed ? DR. DEXTER : No . Notice what ? girl : The windows . girl : You ever seen an abandoned building without one single broken window ? girl : And you know how boys are ... CLERK : May we help you ? DR. DEXTER : Yes.

CLERK : What is that ? 1700 West ? CLERK : 1800 West . CLERK : Hold on , let me take a look . CLERK : Here it is .

GOODlE : Pounding the same question into my mind ! GOODlE : Why ... ? ! GOODlE : Why ... go on ? GOODlE : The only thing that would turn me back ...

Interviewer : Starry Wisdom . Interviewer : That 's what Starry Wisdom is , isn ' t it ... ? Interviewer : Your creative side ? Your imagination ? Interviewer : Why do you choose to call it that ? . GOODlE : You think Starry Wisdom is a metaphor ? GOODlE : A simile ? GOODlE : A fabrication of my mind ? GOODlE : Well , my mind is clear ... GOODlE : Yours is clouded . GOODlE : You haven ' t heard a thing I 've said . GOODlE : You ' re blind . GOODlE : All of you are blind ! GOODlE : Starry Wisdom is real !

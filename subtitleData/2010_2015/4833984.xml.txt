IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY OBSERVERS . ( Walter ) WELL , THAT 'S NOT A PROBLEM . TUNNELS ! 2 1 / 4 MILES OF TUNNELS THAT HOUSE THE STEAM PIPES THAT HEAT HARVARD . THEY MUST HAVE AMBERED IT . IT 'S MY BETAMAX RECORDER . I DON 'T THINK I WROTE ANYTHING DOWN . I THINK I WAS MAKING A VIDEO . THIS PLAN WILL RESRE US AND RID THE WORLD OF THE OBSERVERS . YOU MUST RECOVER EACH TAPE AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO RETRIEVE ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLAN . YOU ARE HUMANITY 'S ONLY HOPE . SLOWLY . SUDDENLY YOU HAVE ALL THE FINESSE OF A BUTCHER . [ scoffs ] WALTER , DO YOU WANT ME TO DO THIS OR NOT ? THIS WORK REQUIRES A SURGEON 'S TOUCH . I 'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO LET YOU TAKE OVER . FINE . PROCEED . BUT IT 'S ON YOUR SHOULDERS . NOT EVEN WARPED FROM THE HEAT . NOT BAD FOR A BUTCHER . WALTER . GOT SOME MORE FUEL FOR THE VAN . ( Walter ) I HAVE TAPE NUMBER ONE . HAVE YOU WATCHED IT ? NO . I 'VE ONLY JUST LIBERATED IT . SHALL WE HAVE A LOOK ? [ static whirring ] [ beeping ] [ lighter flicks , water bubbling ] [ exhales deeply ] I HAD A PRESCRIPTION . IT WAS MEDICINAL . [ distorted ] WELCOME TO TAPE THREE OF MY PLAN ... WHAT HAPPED TO TAPE ONE AND TWO ? WALTER , YOU STORED THE TAPES OUT OF ORDER . SHKER . THESE VIDEOTAPES MUST BE RETRIEVED . THIS TAPE WILL EXPLAIN ONE OF THE MOST CRUCIAL ELEMENTS THAT YOU WILL NEED . TITUDENDONGITUDE FIND COORDINATES 49 DEGRE , ANIA ... 20 MINUTES , 2 SECONDS NORTH , 79 DEGREES , MINUTES , AND 32 SECONDS WEST . NOW , WHEN YOU ARRIVE- - [ audio distorts ] REALLY ? SEE IF YOU CAN REWIND THE COORDINATES . UH , 41 DEGREES , 20 MINUTES , 2 SECONDS NORTH , 79 DEGREES , 12 MINUTES , 32 SECONDS WEST . ARE YOU SURE ? SHE 'S SURE . WALTER . DO YOU RECOGNIZE THE LOCATION ? I 'M SORRY . I-IF I 'VE BEEN THERE , IT 'S BEEN WIPED FROM MY MIND , ALONG WITH THE OTHER PIECES OF MY PLAN TO BEAT THE OBSERVERS . HMM . ( Peter ) THENTIRE AREA IS UNDEVELOPED . THERE 'S NOTHING AROUND IT FOR MILES . HOW ARE THE ROADS IN AND OUT OF PENNSYLVANIA THESE DAYS ? DO YOU THINK WE CAN GET ALL THE WAY OUT THERE SAFELY ? ( Etta ) WE 'D NEED TO AVOID CHECKPOINTS . I MEAN , IT 'S A LONG WAY TO GO , CONSIDERING WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR . OR IF IT 'S STILL EVEN THERE- - WHATEVER IT IS . HEY , WALTER , YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO JOG YOUR MEMORY- - I-I DON 'T THINK I SHOULD TRAVEL . MY FEET ARE SWOLLEN OM STANDING IN FRONT OF THE AMBER ALL DAY . I 'LL STAY HERE FOR A BIT AND ... REGROUP . WHAT ? ( Etta ) WALTER , YOU ALL RIGHT ? I 'M FAIRLY CERTAIN I HAVE A BLOOD CLOT , BECAUSE SOMEBODY WOULDN 'T STOP AT SANN TO LET ME STRETCH MY LEGS . WALTER , WE 'RE FUGITIVES . WE CAN 'T STOP EVERY FIVE MINUTES TO KEEP YOU LIMBER . THIS IS IT ? UH , YES ... THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE WE 'RE SUPPOSED TO BE . SO WHAT WERE YOU DOING OUT HERE 21 YEARS AGO ? [ twigs snap ] IS THAT WHAT WE 'RE OUT HERE TO FIND ? ( Walter ) I 'M TELLING YOU . IT WAS A WICKED TREE DWARF . [ chuckles ] AND I 'M TELLING YOU , IT WAS A KID . I SAW HIM . HE LOOKED RIGHT AT ME . ( Etta ) YOU KNOW , I USED TO IMAGINE THIS- - GOING ON A MISSION WITH YOU . YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY BATTLES WE WON TOGETHER . YOU KNOW , IT 'S A LOT TO LIVE UP TO . NO , YOU 'RE ... EVEN MORE THAN I IMAGINED . [ gun cocks ] DEFINITELY NOT DWARVES . DON 'T TOUCH THEM . IT COULD BE COMMUNICABLE . STOP RIGHT THERE . [ Walter giggling ] ( man ) DR. WALTER BISHOP . THE THREE OF YOU ... YOU HAVEN 'T AGED A DAY . YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD A LONG TIME AGO . WE WERE TRAPPED IN AMBER FOR 21 YEARS . MY NAME IS EDWIN . YOU WERE EXPOSED WHEN YOU GOT HERE . I 'M SUPPOSED TO RETRIEVE SOMETHING HERE , EDWIN , SOMETHING RYMPORTANT . YOU SEEM TO KNOW ME . HAVE WE MET HERE BEFORE ? NO ... AT LEAST NOT IN THE WAY THAT YOU THINK . IT 'S ELECTROMAGNETIC DISCHARGE . WHAT IS THIS PLACE ? YOU 'RE LOOKING AT HISTORY . OURS ... WHOSE ? YOURS , MANKIND 'S . THESE ARE DATA CUBES . STORED ON THEM ... ARE ACCOUNTS OF EVERY MAJOR HISTORICAL EVENT FROM THE DAY OF THE INVASION ONWARD . [ beeping ] YOU HAVE FILES ON US . OF COURSE . YOU 'RE RELEVANT . WE GATHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION FROM AROUND THE WORLD , AND THEN WE RECORD IT . [ chuckles ] YOU HAVE A HEALTHY LORE ABOUT YOU . MY SON , RIVER , IS SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON THE FRINGE DIVISION . WE WERE--WE WERE REFUGEES FROM THE CITIES . MY FATHER STARTED THIS HISTORICAL RECORD . HE BELIEVED OUR HISTORY , LIKE THAT OF ALL OTHER CONQUERED RACES BEFORE US , WOULD BE REWRITTEN BY OUR OPPRESSORS . SOMEONE HAS TO SURVIVE TO TELL MANKIND 'S STORY . WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOU--YOUR SKIN ? YOU SAID WE 'VE ALREADY BEEN EXPOSED . WE NOTICED IT AFTER WE SETTLED . SMALL PATCHES AT FIRST , AND THEN OVER TIME , IT SPREAD . IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS AREA . WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE DRINKING WATER OR THE SOIL . WHY DIDN 'T YOU EVACUATE ? WHAT WE DO HERE IS IMPORTANT . EVEN AFTER WE BECAME AFFLICTED , WE COULDN 'T LEAVE . IT 'S ALL HERE , EVERYTHING . WE CAN 'T MOVE IT . WE CAN 'T TRAVEL . THE WAY WE LOOK ... WE DON 'T WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION . WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE TO RECORD HISTORY . NO ONE WANTS TO COME HERE ... WHICH IS PERFECT FOR US . YOU 'RE THE FIRST IN A VERY LONG TIME . BUT YOU AND YOUR TEAM SHOULD LEAVE , UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOOK LIKE US . WE CAN 'T . THERE WAS A PLAN TO DEFEAT THE INVADERS . I MEAN , THERE IS ... A PLAN TO DEFEAT THE INVADERS . AND I BELIEVE IT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL . BUT I DON 'T REMEMBER IT . BUT I KNOW THAT I AM SUPPOSED TO GET SOMETHING FROM HERE . I 'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE . I MUST HAVE . SEARCH ... BISHOP , WALTER . IF YOU 'VE EVER SET FOOT IN THIS CAMP BEFORE , IT WOULD BE DOCUMENTED . HI . HI . WHAT 'S YOUR NAME ? RIVER . WOW . WHERE DID THESE COME FROM ? I MADE THEM . CAN YOU SIGN THEM ? THESE ARE REALLY GOOD . YOU FOUGHT THEM WHEN THEY CAME . YOU DIDN 'T HIDE LIKE WE DID . YOU 'RE HEROES . I HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT EDITIONS FROM STORIES I 'VE HEARD . A LOT OF THEM I EVEN MADE UP . I WISH I WAS AROUND DURING YOUR TIME , WHEN THERE WERE REAL HEROES . ( Peter ) WELL , KIDDO , YOU 'RE MY HERO FOR GIVING ME A NICE , RO JAWLINE . [ machine clicks , tape rewinding ] [ distorted ] AND 32 SECONDS WEST . NOW , WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE DESIGNATED PLACE , YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE- - [ audio distorts ] ENOU ARRIVE AT THE DESIGNATED PLACE , YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE- - [ audio distorts ] [ air hissing ] [ tape rewinding ] ... PLACE , YOU WILL NEED TO LOCATE ... [ distorted ] A MINE . [ machine clicks , tape rewinding ] ... TO LOCATE [ distorted ] A MINE . [ machine clicks , tape rewinding ] [ normal voice ] LOCATE A MINE . [ cell phone ringing ] HELLO ? OLIVIA , I NEED TO SPEAK TO WALTER . SURE . WALTER . IT 'S ASTRID . YES , WHAT IS IT ? ( Astrid ) DID YOU FIND ANYTHING IN THE ARCHIVE ? NOTHING . THERE 'S ABSOLUTELY NO RECORD OF ME BEING HERE WHATSOEVER . OKAY , WELL , I FOUND SOMETHING . WALTER , IS THERE A MINE WHERE YOU ARE ? - MIME . THE ONLY MIME THAT I KNOW OF IS MARCEL MARCEAU . WHAT 'S HE GOT TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS ? NO . A MINE . YOU SAID MINE--M-I-N-E- - ON THE TAPE . WALTER , WHATEVER YOU 'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND , IT 'S IN A MINE . DO YOU HAVE A MINE- - M-I-N-E--HERE ? YES . IT WAS A GOLD MINE . [ door opens , closes ] THESE MEN HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT . WHERE ? RURAL PENNSYLVANIA . ( Walter ) IN 1923 , A MINE COLLAPSED IN PERU . THE TRAPPED SURVIVORS WERE FORCED TO NOURISH THEMSELVES ON THE DEAD . THANKS FOR THAT , WALTER . OH , BUT I 'M SURE THAT WON 'T BE THE CASE HERE . ( Peter ) FINDING GOLD IN AN ABANDONED GOLD MINE 'S NOT GONNA BE EASY . ( Walter ) WE DON 'T KNOW THAT IT 'S GOLD . WHATEVER IT IS , IT 'S IN HERE . ( Peter ) I 'LL CLIMB DOWN . IS THAT SECURE ? [ grunts ] THERE 'S SOMETHING ON THE OTHER END OF THIS ROPE . CAN YOU GIVE ME A HAND ? YEP . PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING IN AND OUT OF THIS MINE FOR 21 YEARS . I DOUBT IT 'S JUST GONNA BE WAITING FOR US . NOTHING IS THAT EASY . WHOA--OH , OH . IT SNAGGED ON SOMETHING . LOOKS LIKE HE WAS TRYINGTOLIMB . SAME BARK-LIKE GROWTH AS ON THE PEOPLE HERE . BUT WORSE . I 'D ASSUMED WHAT WAS AFFLICTING THESE PEOPLE WAS SOME SORT OF FUNGUS , BUT I WAS WRONG . THESE TISSUES SHOW SIGNS OF CALCIFICATION . PERHAPS WHATEVER WAS CAUSING THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CAMP IS EMANATING FROM THIS MINE . AND THE CLOSER ONE GETS TO THE SOURCE , THE MORE INTENSE THE REACTION IS . NO ONE CAN SURVIVE DOWN THERE . UNTIL I 'VE CONDUCTED AN ANALYSIS , WE HAVE TO TURN BACK . [ cell phone ringing ] THIS IS ANIL . I HAVE SOMETHI FOR YOU . SOMETHING IMPORTANT . ETTA AND HER TEAM HAVE BEEN LOCATED . THANK YOU . IS ANYBODY ELSE STARVING ? HERE . WHAT 'S THAT ? IT 'S AN APPLE . [ chuckles ] NO , THANK YOU . YUM , YUM . DO YOU REMEMBER THAT AMAZING APPLE PIE WE HAD JUST AFTER THE INVASION ? WE WERE IN BOSTON . SOMEONE HAD TOLD US ABOUT THE SHELTER FOR LOST CHILDREN . WE WERE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO EAT WHEN WE FOUND THAT DINGY LITTLE RESTAURANT WITH A COOK WHO WAS A MAD GENIUS . WHAT WAS THAT GUY 'S NAME ? I DON 'T KNOW . YOU DON 'T REMEMBER ? NOPE . WELL , THAT 'S A FIRST . ( Peter ) I CAN 'T BELIEVE I DON 'T REMEMBER THE GUY 'S NAME . IT WAS THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT . IT STARTED WITH A " D. " IT WAS LIKE ... DANTE 'S OR DOMINIC 'S OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT . YOU REALLY DON 'T REMEMBER ? NO . I REALLY DON 'T REMEMBER . [ machine clicks ] [ machine beeps ] ( Peter ) AIR SAMPLE IS READY . I THINK I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE . THIS MAN DIED OF ASPHYXIATION . EVERY PORE ON HIS BODY IS COMPLETELY SEALED . HIS BODY WAS TRYING TO PROTECT ITSELF AGAINST THE AIRBORNE CORROSIVE . SOMEHOW , ITS pH HAS BEEN RADICALLY ALTERED . AGAINST TAND APPARENTLY , ROSIVE . IT GETS MUCH WORSE THE DEEPER ONE GOES INTO THE MINE . ( Peter ) COULD WHATEVER WE 'RE LOOKING FOR HAVE CAUSED THIS ? QUITE UNLIKELY . IF I HAD TO THEORIZE , IT 'S HIGH LEVELS OF CO2 AND OTHER GASES INTRODUCED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BY THE OBSERVERS . FROM THOSE MACHINES THAT THEY WERE BUILDING IN CENTRAL PARK . LL , HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT EDWIN AND HIS PEOPLE ? WELL , THEY 'RE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE SOURCE , RECEIVING ONLY INCREMENTAL DOSES . HOWEVER , PROLONGED EXPOSURE HAS CREATED A DRASTIC IMMUNE RESPONSE . WELL , IMAGINE AN EXTREME FORM OF PSORIASIS . BUT NOT AS EXTREME AS OUR UNFORTUNATE MINE FRIEND RE . DR. BISHOP , I FOUND AN ENTRY I THINK YOU 'LL WANT TO SEE . FIVE WEEKS AFTER THE INVASION , A MAN CAME HERE AND WENT DOWN INTO THE MINE AND GATHERED SEVERAL ROCKS , IT SAYS HERE , WITH A REDDISH HUE . WAS THIS MAN CALLED SEPTEMBER ? NO . MY FATHER HAS IT RECORDED AS A MAN , LATE 30s , DARK HAIR . HIS NAME WAS DONALD . HE SAYS HE WAS WAITING FOR A SCIENTIST FROM BOSTON . I WAS THINKING PERHAPS THAT WAS YOU . I DON 'T KNOW ANY DONALD . WELL , MAYBE YOU JUST DON 'T REMEMBER . IF HE WAS PART OF THE PLAN THAT YOU LOST , THEN IT STANDS TO REASON- - NO , NO , NO . I-I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . WHY WOULD YOU RECORD THIS ? A MAN COLLECTING ROCKS- - WHY IS IT IMPORTANT ? IT WAS RECORDED BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM . HE WAS TAKEN AWAY AGAINST HIS WILL BY TWO INVADERS . SO THEY WEREN 'T HAPPY THAT HE 'D TAKEN THOSE ROCKS . WHY THE HELL WOULD I WANT ROCKS ? YOUR HAND , WALTER . IT 'S ON YOUR SKIN . SHOW ME YOUR HAND . MY GOD . URS TOO . WE 'RE LUCKY . IT HASN 'T ROOTED INTO THE DERMIS YET . BUT I 'M AFRAID THAT WON 'T LAST . OKAY , WELL , HOW LONG UNTIL IT ISN 'T REMOVABLE ? UNTIL IT ISN 'T . DR. BISHOP . ( Walter ) OH ! GOOD , GOOD , GOOD . EXCELLENT , EXCELLENT . OV HE . THANK YOU VERY MUCH . I AM GOING TO BUILD A SUIT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GO INTO THE MINE . ACCORDING TO THE ARM , WE WOULD NEED SKIN 300 LAYERS THICKER THAN A RHINOCEROS TO ENTER THE MINE , SO I 'M TRYING TO ASCERTAIN A METAL OR AN ALLOY THAT WE CAN USE FOR THE SUIT 'S LINING . AND IN THE MEANTIME , I NEED YOU TO GO BACK TO THE VAN BECAUSE I NEED THE WEATHER STRIPPING . SURE . [ cell phone ringing ] HEY , ANIL . I GOT A CALL FROM ONE OF OUR OPERATIVES . THE LOYALISTS ARE TRACKING YOU . YOU 'VE GOT TO MOVE . DID I UPSET YOU ? EARLIER WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE RESTAURANT , IT SEEMED LIKE YOU WERE UPSET . I KNOW YOU DON 'T FORGET NAMES . DONOVAN 'S . THAT WAS THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT . IT 'S NOT THAT I CAN 'T REMEMBER . IT 'S THAT I CAN 'T FORGET . DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE COULDN 'T FIND HER THAT DAY , YOU DREW A PLAN ON A NAPKIN ? YEAH . OF COURSE I DO . YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT GOING UP TO MAINE TO THIS REFUGEE CAMP THAT YOU 'D HEARD ABOUT . AND I WAS LOOKING AT YOU AND NODDING , AND IN MY HEAD I WAS THINKING , " I CAN 'T GO . " BUT THERE WAS A WALLOULDN ' - OF MISSING-PERSON FLYERS . YOU KNOW , WITH EVERY DAY , THE OD OF FINDING OUR LITTLE GIRL THE WAY WE WANTED TO FIND HER WERE GETTING WORSE AND WE DIDN 'T TALK ABOUT IT . I MEAN , I ... I COULDN 'T PUT IT INTO WORDS THEN , BUT ... I FELT RESPONSIBLE . SPONSIBLE HOW ? I WANTED SO MUCH TO BE A MOTHER , BUT ... I JU .. DI 'T THINK THAT I WAS PROGRAMMED THAT WAY . THAT I WAS ... DESTINED FOR SOMETHINGLSE . EVER SINCE I WAS A KID , EVER SINCE THE CORTEXIPHAN TRIALS , I JUST ... I WAS AT ODDS . SO HOW COULD I HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE LITTLE GIRL ? SO , WHEN WE LOST HER , I FELT LIKE THAT WAS MY PUNISHMENT ... MY PUNISHMENT FOR BEING TOO CONFLICTED TO APPRECIATE HER WHEN WE HAD HER . AND THAT DAY AT THE RESTAURANT ... I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GO BACK TO NEW YORK CAUSE I DI 'T WANT TO ... FIND ... WHAT I KNEW WE WERE GOING TO FIND . I JUST ... I JUST BELIEVED SO STRONGLY THAT SHE WAS DEAD , AND I DIDN 'T WANT TO SEE IT . AND YOU THOUGHT I WENT BACK BECAUSE OF MY STRENGTH , AND SHE SAID THAT S ADMIRED ME TODAY . OLIVIA . I SAW HOW YOU WERE WITH OUR LITTLE GIRL . I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HER . AND I 'M NOT TELLING YOU TO FORGET IT , BUT ... THE PAST IS THE PAST . DON 'T LET IT GET IN THE WAY OF THIS . I N 'T KNOW WHY IT 'S HAPPENING , BUT OUR FAMILY GOT SECOND CHANCE . SO I 'M GONNA TAKE IT . ( Etta ) HEY , GUYS . WE HAVE A PROBLEM . THE OBSERVERS ARE TRACKING US . HAND ME THE SEALER . WALTER , HOLONG UNTIL THE SUIT IS FINISHED ? I 'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN . WHY ? THE OBSERVERS KNOW THAT WE 'RE IN THE AREA . THEY SAW US ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN WE STOPPED . NEAR ROUTE 11 . YOU NEED TO LEAVE . I NEED ONE MORE MATERIAL- - COPPER . THERE 'S ONLY THREE ROADS YOU COULD HAVE TAKEN AFTER- - JONATHAN HERE SAYS THERE 'S AN ENCAMPMENT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN WHICH TRADES METALS . NO . YOU 'RE NOT LISTENING . WE HAVE UNTIL MORNING , AT BEST , BEFORE THEY FIND US . THEY 'LL DESTROY EVERYTHING . ALL OF OUR WORK WILL BE LOST . YOU NEED TO GO NOW . NO , NO , IF WE CAN JUST GET DOWN TO THE CAMP- - FORGET THAT CAMP . THOSE MEN ARE DANGEROUS , AND THEY WON 'T TRADE WITH ANYE THEY DON 'T KNOW . YOU KNOW THEM . YOU 'VE TALKED TO THEM ON YOUR RADIO . YOU HAVE CONTACTS IN THAT CAMP ? I 'VE COMMUNICATED WITH THEM ON MY RADIO . BUT ONLY WHEN IT SUITS THEM . THEY DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM . AND THEY CERTAINLY DOT NT PEOPLE ING INTO THEIR QUADRANT- - THAT MUCH I DO KNOW . THE WAY I SEE IT , YOU 'RE OUR ONLY CHANCE . THEY DON 'T KNOW US . LOOK , I 'M ARMED . I 'LL GO WITH YOU . WE CAN BARTER TOGETHER . BARTER WITH WHAT ? WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM ? I 'VE GOT SOME ANTIBIOTICS , MEDICINE . GO BACK TO BOSTON , MAKE THE SUIT THERE , AND THEN COME BACK WHEN IT 'S SAFE . THE BALDIES TOOK AWAY THIS DONALD PERSON WHENE WENT INTO THAT MINE TO GET THE ROCKS . IF THEY READOU AND FINDUT THAT WE 'RE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING , THEY 'LSE IT PERMANENTLY . YOU DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE ROCKS ARE FOR . YOU 'RE PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK . I WANT TO HELP YOU . I DO , BUT ... WHAT HAPPENS IF I DON 'T COME BACK ? YOU MAY BE USED TO FACING DEATH ALL THE TIME , BUT I 'M NOT . THESE ARE BAD PEOPLE . WE MAY NEVER MAKE IT BACK FROM THEIR CAMP . I HAVE A LOT TO LOSE , YOU KNOW . I KNOW YOU DO . BUT THE ROCKS IN THAT MINE ARE IMPORTANT . AND IT 'S TRUE- - WE DON 'T KNOW WHAT THEY DO . BUT WALTER WILL FIGURE IT OUT . AND WHEN HE DOES , WE 'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO DEFEATING THE INVADERS . I 'M NOT AFRAID TO E. I JUST DON 'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY SON . ALL RIGHT . WHAT DO YOU NEED MTO DO ? GET ON YOUR RADIO . TELL THEM ' RCOMING . [ clears throat ] BREAK , BREAK , BREAK . KILO-ALPHA 42 . COME IN . LOOKING TO BARTER . OVER . KILO-ALPHA 42 . IS ANYONE OUT THERE ? OVER . ( man ) THIS IS KILO-ALPHA . WHAT 'S YOUR BUSINESS ? I NEED COPPER . WE DON 'T HAVE COPPER . LET ME SPEAK TO IVAN . TIRE TREAD . MATCHES THE MAKE AND MODEL OF THE VAN THEY WERE IN . WHERE DOES THIS ROAD LEAD ? HIGHER INTO THE MOUNTAINS . RIVER ? LOOK AT ME , SON . WHAT YOU SAW BACK THERE IN THAT TENT ... THERE 'S A LOT MORE TO THE WORD COWARD AND THE WORD HERO THAN YOU THINK . IT 'S COMPLICATED . YOU 'RE NOT A COWARD IF YOU 'RE FRIGHTENED . THAT 'S NOT WHAT IT MEANS . YOU 'RE A COWARD IF YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND YOU DON 'T DO IT . I WAS TELLING THAT MAN OUT THERE THAT I HAVE A LOT TO LOSE- - OUR WORK , THE LIFE WE HAVE HERE ... I TOLD HIM I LOVE YOU SO MUCH , I WOULDN 'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD-BYE . WHEN YOUR MOTHER GOT SICK , I PROMISED HER I 'D PROTECT YOU NO MATTER WHAT . BUT I 'M CONFLICTED . THERE 'S A TIME FOR RECORDING HISTORY , AND THERE 'S A TIME FOR MAKING IT . WE DON 'T GET A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES UP HERE TO MAKE IT . I 'VE DECIDED TO HELP THEM ... TO DO MY PART . I DON 'T WANT TO LOSE YOU . I DON 'T WANT TO LOSE YOU EITHER . BUT PROTECTING YOU ... MEANS MAKING SURE THERE 'S A WORLD OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN THRIVE IN . I LOVE YOU SO MUCH . IT 'S OKAY , DAD . I UNDERSTAND . NO . YOU DON 'T . BUT YOU WILL ONE DAY ... WHEN YOU HAVE CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN . THE MINERAL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS A CRYSTALLIZED FORM OF QUARTZ AT CONTAINS PERFECT PR . [ static ] THEY WILL UNLOCK ITS POTENTIAL AND CREATE A POWERFUL ENERGY SOURCE . [ distorted ] I WILL EXPLICITLY OUTLINE THESE REFINING METHODS IN TAPE SIX ... OR SEVEN . WITHOUT THIS ENERGY SOURCE , WE WILL T ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE FINAL PHASE OF OUR PLAN . TO MY BEST CALCULATIONS , WE WILL NEED AT LEAST 18 KILOGRAMS OF THE CRYSTALS . THAT IS ABOUT 40 POUNDS IN IMPERIAL MEASURES . DID YOU GET ALL THAT ? YEAH . THANKS , ASTRID . HOPEFULLY THE SUIT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO BRING UP 40 POUNDS ? HEY , YOU CONTACT THE CAMP ? YES . THEY FOUND COPPER , AND THEY 'RE WILLING TO TRADE . HOW MUCH COPPER ? 2 KILOS . THAT 'S PLENTY ! TOO MUCH , EVEN ! OKAY . LET 'S GO . ( Edwin ) I CAN 'T . YOU 'RE LOOKING FOR IVAN . YOU CAN GIVE HIM THESE FOR THE COPPER . THEY 'RE SCHEMATICS FOR OUR SOLAR TECHNOLOGY . I 'M NOT COMING WITH YOU . I 'M SORRY . THEY 'LL TRADE FOR THOSE . THEY 'RE VALUABLE . THIS 'LL GET YOU TO THE CAMP . GOOD LUCK . DON 'T WORRY ABOUT IT . WE 'LL BE BACK SOON . WAIT ! BE CAREFUL . I DON 'T UNDERSTAND . THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE HE TOLD US TO GO . HE SAID HE KNEW WHERE THEIR CAMP WAS . WELL , WHY WOULD HE SEND US HERE ? MAYBE HE NEVER WANTED US TO FIND THE CAMP . EDWIN ? [ thud , clanking ] WHAT WAS THAT ? IT 'S THE MINE .

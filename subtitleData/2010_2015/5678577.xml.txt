 Authorities have concluded that the bioroid found early on the 7th after dying an unnatural death had in fact committed suicide . investigators have yet to identify a common connection . it has been revealed that 3000 frozen embryos stored at the Tartaros Center have been destroyed . The cause is currently under analysis . Deunan . Want to go for a long ride ? Sorry . I 'm just about to go shopping with Hitomi . Going for a long ride alone isn 't the same ... What 's the point in taking time off together if this is how it 'll be ? Hey there . hi ! I guess . Yoshitsune ! Welcome back ! Briareos ! Hitomi . Weren 't you going shopping with Deunan ? Huh ? I just got back from a three-day stint at the Legislative Bureau ... Briareos ? training even on your off-days . You don 't seem busy either . Are you kidding me ? We have the fine job of holding down the fort while the others are busy with a secret investigation ! Isn 't Deunan off too ? Where is she ? You guys should go on a date or somethin ' if you 're both off duty . huh ? Deunan ? I saw her by herself today . - Today ? - Yes . There was another bioroid suicide in the Ladon River district and I visited the scene as a Tartaros Center observer . That 's when I saw her . Suicide ... Bioroids are designed to get great joy out of serving humans and maintaining society . why do some choose suicide ? the less it makes sense ... Briareos ? Briareos ? why not just ask her in person ? right ? Listen up ! see down too ! See it all at the same time ! Deunan ... Squeeze the trigger before looking at your target ! Always take out anyone who seems suspicious ! Don 't focus on one spot ! you 'd be dead twice now ! Karl ! Let her take a break already ! How many times must I say it ? ! Don 't give yourself blind spots ! Don 't assume you 'll always have a buddy ! Karl ? ! You 're pushing her too hard ! She can 't keep this up ! Something the matter ? Briareos . Deunan . where did ... What ? N-Nothing . You 're such a weirdo . Maybe she 's getting it overhauled ? she was probably at Ceryneia . Ceryneia ? A gun shop . I hear they even sell weapons wholesale to the police . You 've never heard of it ? They have a good reputation . I hear they 're pros at weapon maintenance . handsome young man . even for a custom Government model . everything else is totally new . Deunan ? it 's always been like that . It 's a keepsake from my dad . in that case ... Karl ... Karl ! Why must you push your own daughter so hard ? ! Karl ? ! Is that ? She 's my daughter ... The only family I have left . no matter what it takes . Even if it makes me seem like a monster right now . Deunan is vulnerable without you to watch her back . Briareos ... All Olympus bioroids are fabricated and managed here at Tartaros . They 're clones made from altered human genes . from intentionality to emotional stasis . but their internal software isn 't . bioroids are complex and sophisticated high-precision robots . Including myself . Here we are ... Is there an issue with this file ? Never mind . Lark Ceryne ... he 's a bioroid with Karl Knute and Alcides ' genes . Bioroids crafted from such a combination of superior human genes you see . ideal humans ... They 're not perfect . they wouldn 't commit suicide . living isn 't a right . It 's a duty . then self-abandonment is their only way to know true freedom . That 's far from perfect . You were out late . yeah . Sorry . Where 's your Government model ? I 'm having it overhauled . It 's no big deal . Why do you ask ? No big deal " ? Briareos . We 're talking about the gun Karl left you as a keepsake . Can you really entrust it ... to that guy ? What ? You went and investigated me ? ! I can 't believe this ! Explain yourself ! What 's wrong with caring about your partner ? ! You call someone who snoops and spies on me a partner ? ! When did you suddenly become my guardian ? ! I 'm saying it for your sake ! You just won 't be happy until you 've worked your will on me ! You 're just like my shitty dad ! Shitty dad " ? ! Whatever ! I 'm outta here ! it 's natural for Briareos to be concerned about you ! you should be happy he has such strong feelings for you ! It 's not like that ! He 's just like my lousy dad ! I wonder if Yoshitsune feels as strongly about me ! Hey ! Are you even listening to me ? ! In that case ... How do you feel about this other man of yours ? Yes ! That 's it ! Out with it ! We 'll give you whatever advice you need ! right ? he looks like my dad on the outside . I 'm guessing he has his genes . They do say it 's common for humans to like someone who resembles their father . though . You don 't mince words . Looks like we could use some more drinks . I 'll go get some . though . It 's normal for bioroids to share genes with complete strangers ; being attracted to someone just because of a fatherly resemblance is something only humans experience ! What ? What was the point of coming to you for help then ? now ... The body in the empty building is a male bioroid . Identity is being determined . Appears to be a suicide by firearm . Forensics is en route . body found is a male bioroid . Identity is being determined . All done . See for yourself . - Did you test-fire it ? - 200 shots from 50 yards . The grouping rate is off by less than a decimal point . thanks . Are you sure ? after all . though . Want to get a bite to eat ? - Couldn 't ask for more . - Then it 's decided ! but first ... Just in time ! Is this what you wanted to show me ? tell me ! Just hang on . Okay . Stand right there . You can only see it for a few dozen seconds each day . It 's so pretty ... I don 't have a long life to live . I haven 't undergone longevity processing . An " unprocessed " bioroid ... Feeling death so nearby lets me appreciate fleeting moments . Including this moment we 're sharing together ... right ? Yeah . that frequency over the past year has exceeded Gaia 's projections . then early intervention by ES.W.A.T. would be wise . And ? We finally managed to put the pieces together . even you and Deunan are involved ... I don 't know how to thank you for dinner ; I only did my job . This is just how much I appreciate it . right . You mentioned it was your father 's keepsake . Yeah . He was one shitty dad . now ... Taking rifles apart and rebuilding them instead of playing with blocks ... Close-quarters combat with elite soldiers while playing house ... don 't you think ? But I also owe it to those combat skills for getting me this far in life . But him ... He left for the war and never came back . That much I know . the hero . Briareos was in the same unit . He brought the gun back to me . Thank you for entrusting me with such an important gun . Wait ! We 're still supposed to sit tight ... What for ? Bioroids account for 80 % of Olympus ' population . There are reliability issues in play here . The time to act will come . we remain prudent ! Thanks . I had a nice time tonight . Me too . you see ... - Sure . Keep up the good work . - Goodnight . Deunan . You 're ... but lost the guy . Attempting to locate now . Tell me when you do ! Who 's the next target ? Me . The cops showed up at Tartaros as I was leaving . Seems they 've finally noticed that all the bioroids who 've killed themselves were under my supervision . They 'll discover my connection to you before long . Time is about up . For both of us . I see ... huh ? Assisted bioroid suicide ... He 's a suicidal bioroid too . just like me . I 'm impressed he 's lived this long . I hear humans call Olympus a paradise . by acting as the cogs to carry out Gaia 's intentions . But bioroids with deadly impulses are anomalies in the system we call Olympus . That uncertain behavior affects everything . bioroids mustn 't commit suicide . And that 's why you 're killing them ? Please don 't treat me like some deranged murderer . I 'm simply granting the wishes of bioroids who realize they 're defective and optimizing society . and I obey the voices of mine to maintain this paradise for you humans . for the sake of society . Do you think so ? The impulse driving me might very well be caused by the genes inside me that come from your father . Briareos ! You all right ? So you had intended to catch him from the very start ? A bioroid with my dad 's genes was murdering people . Olympus is too small for me to look the other way . That administrator sided with Lark 's way of thinking . So he gave Lark a list of bioroids who were deemed seriously suicidal during regular counseling sessions . he must 've added his own name to that list . though ? You don 't understand me at all . Why did you come here ? I could 've handled this on my own . I have to keep you safe . I have to keep protecting you . For how long ? ! Just how long do you have to keep protecting me ? Partners are supposed to be on equal terms . I have to watch your back and keep you safe . It 's always been that way ... Then you can stop now . I 've had enough ... Deunan ... I can 't have someone always shielding me ... I can protect myself now . no matter what .

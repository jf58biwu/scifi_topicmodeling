 ZOE : Previously on Caprica ... DANIEL : My wife is gone , and I 've got to get her back . I 'm very confused . I don 't know what you want from me . I want you to be real ! I want you to be her ! DURAM : To bring down the STO , I need a person on the inside . You 're not objective , Jordan . Back off from this . We don 't have anything on Clarice Willow . Yes , sir . You want me to spy on my friend ? If Clarice Willow is who I think she is , we could take down the entire STO . The people who murdered your daughter . CLARICE : Where there is faith , there is hope . LACY : The avatar 's gone . Wasn 't there a backup ? She had a pin . If she had a backup , that 's where she would have kept it . I think some time off-world would be very healthy . There 's a program on Gemenon , training for STO recruits . There 's been enough blood . ( WOMAN CHATTERING OVER PA ) ( MAN CHATTERING OVER PA ) Do you speak Caprican ? Everybody speaks Caprican . Well , do you know if there 's a pick-up area for passengers connecting to other destinations ? Nope . Stranger here myself . What are you doing here ? Internship . You ? Boarding school . DIEGO : Odin Sinclair ? Lacy Rand ? LACY : Yeah , I ... That 's me . DIEGO : We 'd better get moving . Jump ship 's already started boarding . You two are with me . You 're STO ? You don 't have to look so surprised . Hang on . We 're taking off . Whoa ! I hate this . I hate this . I hate this ... Suck it up . It 's going to be all right . We 're leveling off . It 's okay . See ? So , are you a true believer ? I don 't ... I don 't know anymore . How about you ? No . No , my parents are the zealots in the family . They forced you to come here ? They had two armed goons storm into my bedroom in the middle of the night , knock me out , and load me into a shuttle . Wow . I woke up halfway to Gemenon . Attention , please . My name is Diego . I welcome you all to the holy birthplace of monotheism . We 're on our way now to the retreat , where the Reverend Holy Mother lives . You will enter children and you will exit warriors of the one true God , those of you that survive . LACY : What is that ? ( GRUNTS ) It 's a ship . It 's on top of us . ( RUMBLING ) DIEGO : It 's the Apolli . They 've been too easy lately . They 're locking on to us . ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING IN FEAR ) Shake them off . Shake them off , come on ! ( CLARICE WHISPERING ) But the pin is what we 're after . MAR-BETH : What are you doing ? ( GASPS SHARPLY ) ( EXHALES ) Oh , you scared me . ( PANTING ) Are you spying on Clarice ? No , of course not . No . Mar-Beth , I ... I don 't know how to say this , but ... I think she might be using again . What ? She 's up at all hours , she 's not eating , and she 's been going into her room with her door shut . It 's just , the signs are there . She hasn 't touched purple for months . I know my wife better than you do . Well , I hope I 'm wrong . I care about her , too , you know . ( INDISTINCT ) Zoe 's infinity pin has to be in Global Defense somewhere , picked up in the sweep of the house . Tell our person to look wherever they store the evidence . Tell them I don 't care if their cover is blown . This is really important . MAN : ( DISTORTED ) Calm down , Clarice . It 's covered . ( EXHALES ) ( BEEPING ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( RUMBLING ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIMING ) They got us sealed . They 're going to try to board us . They 're going to try to board us ! ( CLATTERING ) ( METAL GROANING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( COUGHING ) ( GROANS ) ( MACHINE GUNS FIRING ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( APOLLI SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ) ( WHISPERING ) Does anybody know what he 's saying ? Shh ! ( CONTINUES SHOUTING ) He says , " The mighty Gods are striking back . " No ! ( GASPS ) ( PEOPLE EXCLAIM ) ( GIRL SOBBING ) AMANDA : It 's the only thing I could come up with . She had me dead to rights . Are you positive she believed you ? I don 't know . Maybe ... Yes . Maybe . I don 't know . Amanda , just promise me you 'll be careful . Did you learn anything useful ? No . No , I ... If I could get closer , I could . If you could get me a camera or a bug , I could plant it in Clarice 's room . She hasn 't trained herself not to vocalize when she uses her Holoband . Maybe ... No , the problem is , if I go in for a warrant , I 'm going to have to admit I have a confidential informant in the Willow house . I 'm not willing to do that . I 'm not willing to die . I can 't let them catch me eavesdropping again . They will kill me . ( SIGHS ) Okay . Warrants are overrated anyway . I 'll get you the tick . What , you don 't trust your own people ? Saves disappointment later . ( SIGHS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Spycam ? ( CLEARS THROAT ) Building a case against your exes ? ( CHUCKLES ) That 's a good one , sir . No , it 's related to the bombings . Shame , because I 'd like to hear you say the words , " I have a warrant for this . " Relax . It 's background . You got a CI placed somewhere ? You know better than to ask me that , especially when we both know there 's a possibility we 've got a leak in this department . You think I 'm STO ? Of course not . Jordan , I 've given you a lot of leeway on this . Yes , and I haven 't divulged the identity of an active CI , not to anybody , not to my own mother . I need the jackets for any and all Cls you have in the field . I won 't do it , sir . And until I get that , you don 't get so much as a paperclip . Believe it or not , you work for me . I work for Caprica . ( DOOR CLOSES ) Forward . What are we looking at here ? Zoom . You 're watching the Ha 'la 'tha steal and smuggle Cylons off-world . Hold . Is that true ? Tell me that Guatrau will change his mind . Tell me they 're going home to our people . Where , then ? Hmm ? Gemenon , some crazy fringe group . It 's ... You knew about this ? Which side ? With the Guatrau , it 's always about the money . You know that . Which side , Yoseef ? ( SIGHS ) STO . Oh , nice . We forsake the struggle of our own people , let them die in the streets . We sent no weapons to help them , but the frakkers who murdered your wife , blew up your child ... Don 't . No , I 'm glad the Guatrau found it in his heart to show them a little bit of love . No , no , no , don 't you go getting pious on me . Okay ? Do you think I like the position I 'm in ? We don 't ... What 's happened to you ? Where is your outrage ? ( SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( SIGHS ) All right , here 's what I need . Don 't talk right now . DANIEL : I don 't really have a choice . If my government discovers we 've been exporting exclusively contracted technology to terrorists , it could blow directly back onto me . I could be executed for treason . And don 't think for a second that just because they 're coming after me , they won 't come after you and all your people . I need a one-on-one with the Guatrau . And what in the Twelve Worlds makes you think he 'd grant you that ? It 's always about the money , right ? ( DOOR OPENS ) ( SOBBING ) What 's going on ? ( WHISPERING ) He 's taking us up into orbit . MAN : Stop frakking me around . We 've got all our prisoners . We will have all our people ! Well , the difference this time is that we have hostages to trade . Hostage exchange , that 's good . He needs us alive . Why do we have their prisoners ? Who cares ? We care because we have to get inside of their heads . We have to be smart . Shh . Listen . We are going to shoot one of these children . Do you understand ? You leave me no frakking choice ! Do you understand me ? Now , we are going to leave this channel open so that you can hear the shot . If they scream , you will hear that , too . LACY : We need to fight back . Keep it down . Come on , we 've got them outnumbered . We 're not professional killers , understand that ? We have to be smart . Now , I 've been trading hand signals with the Canceron and his buddy across the way . As time goes by , they 'll get hungry , they 'll get tired , they 'll get sloppy , and that 's when we move . Look . ( METAL SQUEAKING ) If we can get it loose , at least we have something . We 'll only have one shot at this . MAN : You know , as Zeus once said to his dear brothers ... We have to make it count . ... " Someone needs to go first . " Someone needs to be chosen . " Yes . Well , the question is , who will it be ? Who is going to die for their loving God ? Their God that does not answer them . Their God , who is going to let them die . Who is it going to be ? Hmm ? I like this boy right here . Yeah ? You ? ( STAMMERING ) Why me ? No , no , please don 't . I 'll do anything . MAN : Then stand up . What do you want me to do ? I 'll do anything . Stand up . Please , no , look . I just ... Please ... Stand up ! I 'm sorry , please , I 'll do anything . Please ! Get on your feet ... I don 't want to die ! Please ! ... and act like a man . Please . Just , I don 't want to ... I don 't want to die ! ( STRIKES ) Bad answer ! Let go ! ( SCREAMS ) Stand up on your pathetic legs and walk ! ( SOBBING ) I don 't want to die ! I 'll do anything ! Walk ! I want you to walk ! I don 't want to die ! Please don 't kill me ! Do you hear him crying for his father ? Please don 't kill me ! Do you hear that ? He 's begging . Well , beg to this man right here . Please , I 'll do anything ! Beg to him ! He will do anything ! I 'll do anything . But what will you do ? I 'll do anything ! Kneel down ! Kneel down ! Kneel down ! Kneel down . Please , please ! Put your hands down . Don 't kill me . Put your hands down and move . Move ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( SOBS ) ( CRYING ) MAN : Start the clock . ( WHISTLING ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) Hey , Alpy , what 's the good word ? Got a pulse . Feeling good about that . Hey , you remember that Libran porn ring we busted last year ? I treasure the memories . We still got that camera ? We got everything . This is where old cases go to die . Do me a favor . Take a smoke break , huh ? Be discreet , huh ? Always . Oh , frak . For the Gods ' sake , Alpy , the rats have gotten in here ! ALPERT : Big city , of course we 've got rats . Yell a little louder , why don 't you ? That 's junk . Hey , Alpy ? Anybody else been in here lately , going through the Graystone evidence ? Nope . They would have signed it . Unless they 're you , obviously . What about after hours ? Could be . Hey ! Who 's got the entry codes ? Just the top brass . What 's this all about ? Nothing good . Thanks again . This ... This is my resurrection program . The commercial we launched with those cute little children , " Grace by Graystone . " That suggested one possible , very frivolous application . But when this program is complete , it will end death and disease . It will demolish our very conception of mortality . Whoever controls this will transcend any single corporation , government or syndicate . So anything we do now that jeopardizes this opportunity , this ... Well ... You think my decision to sell your robots off-world was stupid . By arming terrorists , you gained short-term profit , yes , but at the expense of the biggest potential payday in either of our organizations ' history . How much time do you need to complete your program ? Three months , plus additional staff and resources . Two weeks . I 'll halt the export of the robots for that long . After that , you had better impress me . Of course , Guatrau . I 'll get it done . GUATRAU : He 's a very ambitious man . We need to be careful with him . Brave , too . I like him . He reminds me of myself at that age . But you 're right not to trust him . One must be careful with ambitious men . I gave him two weeks to deliver this new technology . If he succeeds , we 'll make money . If he fails , we 'll lose little . Either way , we need to protect ourselves . For Dr. Graystone 's journey . We 're killing him ? Do it quietly , Samuel . SAM : I will . Good . Now then , who 's hungry ? As the Olympian Gods rose , the Titans fell , as all Gods must . Now one God can kill them all . One God . This can only be mankind putting his own face into the heavens , making a God from his own image . ( WHISPERING ) We 've got to do something . It 's the height of hubris ! We 've got about a minute . The Pantheon understands mercy . Are they watching ? You are too young to know what is in your hearts . LACY : No . ( METAL SQUEAKING ) You must make the right choice . God , I can 't . I can 't . It 's not ready yet . I can 't . We can 't just let someone die . Kneel before the Arrow of Apollo and renounce your monad god and you will be spared . Do you understand ? Renounce or you will be shot . I see . All the Gods who are visible in the seven circles ... Kneel . ... and every God , by his own proper power , brought forth what was appointed him . I foreswear the false God . Kiss the Arrow of Apollo . Good boy . Find him something to eat . Put your arms down . Put your arms down . Stand . Stand . Stand . You are safe now . No one else ? Must be hungry . Thirty seconds from now , you might wish you 'd taken the offer . ( SIGHING ) Suit yourselves . Who will be next ? ( SNIFFLING ) Stand . Stand . It 's okay . It 's okay . MAN : Come with me . May the one true God have mercy on your souls . She 's brave . Keep your eyes on them . ( SQUEAKING ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( WARBLING ) Hello , sweetheart . Haven 't seen you since that awful derezzing incident . I blame you , just a little bit . Can 't tell your wife you killed a man and not expect a little healthy pushback . A marriage only works as an equal partnership , so look out , mister . What are you doing ? You said I was fawning too much . So now you 're just guessing what I want from you ? Which is a typical human reaction , if you think about it . Neurotic . Adorable , even . Very authentic . Make love to me . ( SCOFFS ) My entire future is riding on fixing the resurrection program , which is you . I have two weeks to pass you off as an emotionally recognizable human being . If I don 't , I 'm dead . Let me take your mind off it . And every time I come back in here , you are further off the mark . I 'm sorry , you make me nervous . If she were here , and you were accusing her of being inauthentic , wouldn 't she react just like this ? No . I think she would . Exactly like this . No , she would be mad . She would be in a rage . Well , we don 't have a control group , do we ? No , we don 't . Because we don 't have her . Because you don 't have her . And I 'm glad , because you 're a frakking nasty monster , who deserves to be alone . And I hope you do die ! Was that better ? ( SIGHS ) This isn 't working . ( SIGHS ) Delete program . SERGE : Of course , Daniel . Shall I upload the backup to the satellite drive ? ( SIGHS ) Delete backup . My pleasure . ( SIGHS ) CLARICE : Zoe 's pin . Finally . Do you see anything ? Anything attached ? It 's a storage device . There it is . Just like the girl said . Now we have the key to the afterlife . Remember this moment , Olaf . They 're going to write about it in the Holy Scrolls . ( KNOCKS GENTLY ) ( DOOR CLOSES HEAVILY ) What ? You win . I have a CI . I knew it . Where ? Read it , shred it . Don 't speak of it , don 't log it into an e-sheet . I can 't have this woman burned . She trusts me . Fair enough . Plus , I get a blank check . Any tick I want . ( SCOFFS ) Nothing crazy or off-budget . I just need room to operate freely . That 's the deal . Fine . She 's a good asset . She 's placed inside Clarice Willow 's house . We 're on the verge of cracking the STO . I know this was hard for you . Requisition whatever you need . Thank you , sir . And , Jordan ? We 're all on the same side . I know that , sir . Just trying to protect my people . Listen carefully . I 'm about to tell you something that 's going to upset you . Tell me . My GDD contact tells me you have a spy in your house . ( WHISPERING ) Four minutes to airlock . We need to move . No , wait till he gets back on the phone . If we wait , someone dies . No talking . We 're not talking . We 're praying . But your false God will not help you . God helps all of us . We 'll be quiet . We 'll be quiet . ( ENUNCIATING ) God helps all of us . Airlock ! This is your fault ! This is all your fault ! We should have moved when there was more of us ! I 'm so sick of people making bad decisions in God 's name . No , take him ! We 're going to die because of you ! Go ! Now ! ( GRUNTING ) Now ! ( GRUNTING IN RAGE ) That 's enough ! Enough . Enough . We 're done here . We 're done here . Everyone take your seats , please . LACY : ( STAMMERING ) I don 't understand . They were frakking with our heads . Probably shot dummies out the airlock , didn 't you ? Yes . This was your initial placement exercise . We needed to find out how you 'd function under stress . Who would crumble , who would step up . It 's good work . We 'll be at the compound within the hour . Thank you . I need you home . I can 't . Not yet . I 'm in a bad situation , and I don 't know if I can make it through without you . What have you done ? The less you know about it , the better . How am I supposed to help if you won 't tell me what you 've done ? I don 't know ! I 'm not thinking clearly . I haven 't been sleeping . I 'm losing it . I 'm losing it ! No , you 're not . That crazy confidence of yours is just the side you let everyone see . This side , what 's going on right now , this fear and this anxiety , that is always there , that is always with you . I don 't ... Yes , it is . Sweetheart ... It eats at you , you overcome it , and it gives you forward momentum . That 's how you work . Without that , I don 't think your little empire would exist . So , I exploit my own fear to get what I want ? That 's your novel theory ? You exploit anything that isn 't nailed down . That 's my theory . The truth hurts , pal . No , it doesn 't . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) ( SIGHS ) Where are you ? ( SLICING ) Thank you . Mmm-hmm . ( SIGHING ) You hear they fished a floater from the Theoresos ? No . Yeah . About 200 clicks from here . Female . Head , hands , feet removed . Medical Examiner thinks that the woman recently gave birth . They 're going to do a sweep of medical facilities , but I don 't think they 're going to be able to match anything to records . Some people just don 't like hospitals , I guess . You , uh ... You hear from your CI ? Nope . Heard from Clarice Willow , though . She reported her wife missing . Apparently , there was a fight . Mar-Beth stormed out . Clarice chalked it up to post-partum depression , but hasn 't seen or heard from her since . I had nothing to do with this . Mar-Beth knew the risks . Anything else ? No , sir . Well , keep me in the loop . Yes , sir . We 're all in this together , sir . So , did you have a chance to look around ? I did . I found my quarters . I found my bunk . I found the cocktail party . Excellent . Ah ! You remember our friend , the Apolli hijacker ? Kevin Reikle , STO praetor . God , I 'm so sorry about beating you . No one 's ever gun-butted me before . It 's impressive . Thank you , sir . DIEGO : All right , we should all go in and eat . Tomorrow , the hard work begins . It 's weird , hey ? Yeah . Not bad , though . Odin , aren 't you hungry ? What ? I 'm not sure . Look . They 're from the shuttle . What are they doing ? The ones that failed . ( SOBBING ) Holy frak . Never forget who these people are , and what they 're capable of .

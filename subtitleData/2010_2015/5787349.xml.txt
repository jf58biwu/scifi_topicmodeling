 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting To find a way out . Do you think this is where lyle disappeared to ? It 's a tunnel . Pauline : James ? I expect you know That I 'm alive . Your mother told you to trust lyle ? You mean before she died ? Two days ago , she sent me an e-mail . She 's alive . She 's out there somewhere . I saw that in my dream . I 've seen it , too . It 's in my hometown . Zenith . That 's the same that town I 'm from . You keep saying you 're on my side , but it sure as hell You killed the 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved ! I had to ! Everything pauline put In her journal has come true . It says in here that if those four kids die , The dome comes down ! You 're not even gonna touch those kids . Sam ! ( gasps ) Hey . Bad dream ? Sam jumping off the cliff . You couldn 't stop him . It 's what he said before he jumped . That he admitted to killing angle ? He said a lot of things . He 's crazy . I mean , he thought his dead sister 's drawings Of angle and the hands were some kind of message . If he killed them , the dome would come down . You need to get some sleep . I don 't think I can . Well , in the morning , We 're gonna have to tell junior and joe . Good morning . Um ... I guess I fell asleep . It 's okay . You were tired . Knowing lyle 's out there wanting to kill us kept me awake . You stayed up to keep us safe ? It wasn 't hard . Not with joe snoring like an elephant in heat . I heard that . Did the egg do anything else last night ? Uh , not since it showed us the obelisk from zenith . Which is so weird . Why would it show us Something from my hometown ? Your hometown is barbie 's hometown . That has to mean something . ( car doors closing outside ) Shh ! Someone 's coming . Whoa ! Friendlies . Barbie . You made it out of the cave-in . And you 're all right . You found the egg . In the lake . Where you said it would be . When we were all together , it floated to the surface . Like ... It needed to be with us . You have to keep it safe . I will . We have to talk about sam . Why ? Is my uncle okay ? He 's dead , junior . What ? What happened ? Yesterday , when you went into the tunnels with sam To find lyle , it was because we thought lyle killed angle . Except he didn 't . Sam did . No . You 're lying . I saw the scratches that she left on him . And once I knew , He jumped off of a cliff at the end of the tunnel . No , no . That-that 's not true . I 'm sorry , junior . I 'm just supposed to believe you ? You don 't know my uncle . You going after him , too ? No . We need to get sam 's body . The only real evidence that we have Are those scratches that angle left on him . And until junior and the whole town sees that , We 're not gonna put this behind us . Big jim : It looks like you lived to see another day . Jim . You gonna tell me what you 're doing , Or are you just gonna keep me guessing ? Come on , barbie . You know I 'm gonna find out one way or another . Look , the whole reason I got into trouble in the first place Yesterday is that I wasn 't fully equipped to explore the tunnels . So , I figured I 'd go back and do it right And see what I see . You 're gonna tell me what you find ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , you 'll be the first to know . Julia : Where 'd it go ? Disappears in the darkness . It 's the same thing that happened to sam . I didn 't hear it land . How 's that possible ? Same way the dome 's possible . Got any ideas to help us understand Where that cliff might lead to ? Rebecca : No , I don 't understand it . This laser pointer Never reaches the far side . And even stranger , my compass is spinning . Says we 're facing every direction at once . I don 't like this . Me , neither , but you saw junior 's reaction . He 's not gonna believe that sam killed angle Till he sees that body himself . Scratches and all . Promise me you 'll be careful . Of course I will . All right . Be right back . What do you see ? ( laughs ) I see a whole lot of dark . Describe the rock face . Any vegetation ? Nope . It 's dead as a doornail . Got to be 20 feet down by now . Can you see the bottom ? No ! But the darkness- - I think I 'm ... Getting closer to it . ( grunting loudly ) You guys messing with the rope ? No , we didn 't touch it ! All right , well , something just pulled me ! Barbie , come up . ( grunts loudly ) Oh , my god ! The anchor 's coming loose ! Barbie ! Hey ! ( yells ) Barbie ! ( grunting ) Rebecca ! Barbie , I 've got the rope ! You need to climb ! Julia , let go ! ( grunting ) Julia ! Julia , let go of the rope ! The hell I will ! Julia , I can 't hold it ! ( grunts ) If we don 't let go , we 'll go over , too ! Julia ! Barbie ... Don 't you dare . I got you . I love you , julia . I can pull you up ! ( screaming ) : No ! Barbie , can you hear me ? ! Barbie , say something ! Julia . Barbie ? Julia . Barbie , say something , damn you ! Barbie ! Come on , come on , come on , come on . Say something ! Okay . Do you think he did it ? You knew my uncle back when you were ... Alive before . Do you think he 's capable of murder ? The sam I used to know was sweet and kind And always smiling . But now I don 't know . There 's something so much darker in him . What do you think ? I trusted him . How could my own uncle murder angie ? Did I hear you right ? Sam murdered angle ? Who told you this ? Barbie . He found out when they were down in the tunnels . And then sam killed himself . So barbie told you . I 'm sorry , son . Are you ? I 'll be downstairs . Look , I know this is tough to hear , son . But your uncle was always ... He was off . It 's why we didn 't get along . The truth is he was never as strong as you and I. And this town needs strength . It needs us . Well , right now , I don 't care what the town needs . Well , you need to . Now more than ever . We 're special , junior . The dome chose me . And you 're my son ... No , no , no . I 'm done listening to this . Junior , junior . Junior , please listen to me . Why do you always have to make everything about you ? Angie loved this . I know . She 's never coming back . And you 're at peace with it ? I 'll never be at peace with it . But I have to accept it . You 're staring into that thing like It 's a crystal ball or something . It 's got me thinking about the dome . Something isn 't adding up . Does anything add up anymore ? There was never a tunnel down there . And now there is . What 's your point , joe ? My point is ... Where did it come from ? And why is it here ? We should go back in there . No . I-I am sorry , okay ? But we called for him . There wasn 't any answer . There 's just no way he could survive a fall like that . Okay , come on . Why don 't you lie down , huh ? There 's a couch in my shop room . Rebecca , no one can know . What ? Just until I can tell them . I just need to figure it out first . You 're worried about big jim . Without barbie , there 's no telling what he 'll do . I 'll follow your lead , okay ? Now , come on . Big jim : There you are . Why didn 't you tell me ? Tell you what ? About sam . I had to hear it from junior . He was devastated . What do you want , jim ? Well , I want to talk to barbie . Where is he ? He 's ... Bringing up sam 's body . Ah , well , I 'll give him a hand . Um , the tunnel 's not safe . Could collapse at any moment . Rebecca made me come up , too . Oh . What 's wrong , julia ? Are you upset ? No . No , it 's just the dust . Like she said , it 's bad down there . And only barbie is equipped to get through it . He , uh , wanted to ask If maybe you would go down to the police station . In case any calls came in . Of course , any-anything I can do to be of service . ( dog barking nearby ) ( girls laughing ) ( groans ) ( grunts ) ( kids chattering , laughing nearby ) ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ ¶ Can I help you ? I 'm looking for pauline verdreaux . And you are ? Her brother , sam verdreaux . I 'll get someone to take you up . Your sister 's in the locked ward . Barbie 's gone ? Does that mean he 's dead ? Oh , my god . What happened ? He cut the rope on purpose . But why ? To save rebecca and me from going over the cliff . I don 't believe it , julia . The dome wouldn 't let anything happen to barbie . It went crazy when big jim tried to hang him , right ? And now a tunnel appears that wasn 't here three weeks ago ? What do you mean it wasn 't there three weeks ago ? I lived in chester 's mill my entire life . The basement underneath this school has always just been ... A basement . And then a tunnel appears ? What if the dome dug it ? And that tunnel and that cliff and barbie going down there Was all part of the dome 's plan ? A plan for what ? I don 't know . But we can find out . If we go over that cliff ourselves . I would never let you do that . I don 't mean us . Then what do you mean ? I was president of the school 's robotics club , And we made stuff that might help us find exactly What 's at the bottom of that cliff . Okay . Okay . Meet me at the locker in a half hour . I 'll be right back . Has my sister been here long ? Place like this ? Time don 't exactly mean much . She 's in there . Thanks . Yeah . Uh , let me remind you , too , That this is your vision . This is ... Oh , my god . Sam . Hi , sis . Oh ... ( crying ) Uh ... But ... You were inside the dome . Did it come down ? No . How 'd you get out ? I 'm still trying to figure that out myself . And junior- - did he get out ? Is he all right ? He 's still in chester 's mill . He knows you 're alive . He got your message . Oh , we have so much to talk about . Don 't bother with that . ( gasps ) ( panting ) You know how nosy neighbors can be . And what we have to discuss is ... No one 's business but our own . Jim ... What are you doing in here ? You know , I ... I blame myself , In part , for this . I trusted you . I never should 've . What are you talking about ? You made a huge mistake crossing me . Did I never mention ... That the dome ... Saved me from death At those gallows ? It redeemed me . It chose me ... To do what it wants . And yet you couldn 't see that , could you ? Otherwise You wouldn 't have lied to me . I didn 't lie to you . Yes , you did . ( whimpers ) Jim , you 're scaring me . Well , maybe you should be scared . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I waited outside that school . I saw you leave- - but barbie ? He never left . So where is he ? And do not lie to me again . Ever . Barbie ... Barbie 's dead . ( sighs ) ( exhales ) Welcome home , barbie . Been worried about you , barbie . We 've been staking out your apartment . Where you been hiding the last three weeks ? Rick . You promised you were gonna go Run a few errands for maxine , Then be back to do a job for me . Got sidetracked . You knew what we were gonna clear for that info On aktaion energy 's rd . It would 've made us all rich . Well , you , anyway . But then you just up and vanished . Would you believe me if ... I told you I was stuck under the dome ? ( men chuckle ) ( coughing ) ( grunts ) You 're gonna do the aktaion job you said you would . At half the price . And if I say no ? ( groaning ) You won 't have enough teeth to form the word . No , it 's okay ! Okay ! Just ... Give me a day to get organized , all right ? I just got back . You 'll go now . I still can 't believe you got out . Makes two of us . How ? We found these tunnels underneath the school . At the end of them , there was a cliff . And , um ... I went over it . You jumped on purpose ? No . It was dark . I fell . Anyway ... All that matters is that I 'm here . And found you . How come you didn 't tell me that you were gonna fake Your own death ? Don 't you trust me ? ( sighs ) of course I trust you . I didn 't tell you because I don 't trust myself . I don 't understand . I knew the dome was coming down , Even if big jim said I was crazy . But you weren 't crazy . The dome did come down . Yeah . And I just thought if I left chester 's mill , That the dome would follow me . And I was afraid to tell you about my plan , Because then you 'd prevent me from leaving . All right . I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . Any sane person would . Guess it 's no shock lyle believed me . Is that why you asked him for help ? I sent him postcards over the years . I know it was wrong to use him that way , But I needed to stay in contact with someone . And I knew he wouldn 't tell anyone . I did all this to save the town- - You , my son . And I was wrong , and now ... James is stuck in there . I guess anything is possible if you and lyle could get out . What ? Have you seen lyle ? Yes , I 've seen him . He 's here . How about now ? Julia : Hold on one sec . You see anything ? Yeah , we 've got picture , And it 's recording . In just a second , it 'll be showing us Whatever 's at the bottom of that cliff . Norrie : Julia , are you sure you want to look ? I want to see whatever 's down there . No matter what . Here we go . ( whirring ) Okay , it 's just passing 20 feet . Norrie : It looks like ... Just rocks . Nothing else . Hey , we 're losing picture . We shouldn 't be . Joe , what 's happening ? I-I don 't know . You better pull it back , joe . Pull it back . I 'm-I 'm trying , but it won 't come back up . I thought you said you knew how to fly it . I do ! Damn it . We 've lost the signal . I 'm sorry , julia . It 's my own fault . When you guys started talking about tunnels , I just really wanted ... I really wanted to believe there was a chance . We all did . Um , guys ? You need to see this . I thought I saw something in that last bright flash And rewound the video . And it was a bright flash- - so what ? Unless you see it frame by frame . Right there . That looks like a slide . No , I think it 's a playground . Where ? I don 't know . Norrie : Oh , my god . The obelisk . ¶ ¶ This is really the place ? The owner of aktaion energy lives here . So shut your mouth , watch our six . ( alarm wailing ) What the hell ? You double-crossing son of a bitch ! Put down your weapon ! Hey , hey , easy , easy , all right ? I can explain all this . Dale ? Is that you ? Oh , my god , it is you . Hi , dad . A drink ? A beer , if you got one . Mm . How long 's it been ? Two years ? Two and a half . Either way , entirely too long . Please , sit . No . I 'll stand . ( chuckles ) Is it weird that I 've missed your stubbornness ? Reminds me of your mother . I 'm happy to hear I remind anyone of her . So you gonna tell me why you Hit the panic code and then Took down the man that you were with ? It doesn 't matter . He 's in cuffs . I don 't suppose you 're gonna tell me How you got those wounds either . I assume that you haven 't come here to patch things up . You want something from me . What is it ? A favor . Lyle : Melanie ? That 's all he says , over and over again . The police found him in the middle of town , Looking at the obelisk . Melanie . And they brought him here . Melanie ? Melanie . Hey , lyle ? Melanie . Melanie . Lyle , can you hear me ? Lyle . Melanie ! He didn 't recognize me either . That 's all he does : Eat , sleep and say " melanie . " And no one knows he was inside the dome ? Melanie . No one even knows his name . He didn 't have a wallet . Something must have happened to him When he went off that cliff . ( sighs ) But you 're okay . That 's true . Melanie ? Melanie . There 's only one ... Melanie that I can think of he would be talking about . There-there 's no way he 's talking about her , right ? Our melanie ? That was so long ago . There 's something you should know . Melanie 's alive . She came back from the dead . I need you to get me into the dome . You want me to get you to the dome ? I need to get a message to somebody on the inside . Who ? It doesn 't matter . Obviously it does or you wouldn 't be here . Dad , trust me , I wouldn 't be asking you this if it wasn 't important . Dale , the dome coming down Is arguably the most significant event in history . The whole world is watching . The national guard has established a ten-mile No-go zone around the perimeter . And the other half of that is-is a bombed-out wasteland . Yeah , but you 've pulled strings before . But not like this . And I can 't go to my friends in d.C. I mean , it 's-it 's not gonna work out . They 're gonna think that I 'm a fool . So this is about business . Don 't start . No , you have not changed a damn bit . Everything I 've done in business has been for our family . But you could never have seen that . If you did , you wouldn 't have run off and joined the army . I wouldn 't have had to pull strings To bring you home from your deployment early . Look , I never asked you to do that . No . But your mother did . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) You think it 's a coincidence ... That she got sick right after you came home ? She knew she was running out of time . She just ... Wanted to say good-bye . ( exhales ) Dad , I have never ... Asked you for anything . But I 'm asking you now . Please ... Help me get to the dome . ( sighs ) Joe ? Norrie ? They 've got to be here . We 've looked everywhere else . Julia ? Anyone ? I don 't like being here . Me neither . Joe : Hey ! ( gasps ) Joe ? Where are you ? Joe : I 'm down here ! You scared the hell out of us . We heard about barbie . Is it true ? Yeah , but I-it 's all complicated . Is julia down there ? Yeah , she 's down here . Is she okay ? Yeah . Do you have the egg with you ? Right here . Okay , perfect timing . Come on . We have to show you guys something . Let 's go . Come on . ( doorbell jingles ) What are you doing ? We 're having a memorial . For barbie . Shouldn 't julia be here ? No one can find her . And I didn 't want to wait , Given barbie 's importance to this town . I 'm sad that he 's gone . I know at times we may have been enemies , but ... Often he was the only thing Standing between this town and disaster . It 's a real loss for everyone . And now it 's time for all of us to come together . Around you . I think it 's time for prayer . All right , folks . Let 's gather round . And bow your heads . Oh , heavenly father , You 've gotten us through dark times before , And we pray That you will get us through this one . I 'm glad you decided to stay , dale . Well , it 's just for the night . And I guess I ... Owe you the truth . About ? About why I want to get to the dome . I 'm gonna go out on a limb . There 's a woman inside it . The second that I saw you , I knew you weren 't the same man that I knew Two and a half years ago ; I mean , you 've changed , dale . You ... The way you hold yourself , The look in your eyes . That edge ... You had from iraq is gone . Now , I know there 's only one thing that can do that . What 's her name ? Julia . And do you love her ? Yeah . I love her . You understand that we would risk everything ? I do . And you 're willing to take that risk ? Yeah , I am . All right . I 'll help you get to the dome . Really ? I understand what it feels like To be separated from the woman you love . Thank you , dad . Melanie : Julia . You really think joe 's onto something ? I don 't know . But I hope so . The egg . It 's glowing again . Junior : What 's happening ? What is this ? It 's zenith . That 's where the obelisk is . Does that mean ... That there could be a way out of the dome . Not just that . Barbie could be alive . If he found a way out , maybe he 'll find a way back . ¶ in the swirling ¶ ¶ of the storm ¶ ¶ when I 'm rolling with the punches ¶ ¶ and hope is gone ¶ ¶ leave a light ¶ ¶ a light on ¶ ¶ millions of ¶ ¶ miles from home ... ¶ Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

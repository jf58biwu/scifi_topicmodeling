 Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be . Until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible , inescapable . We 're trapped . We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . - I know , Junior . - What are you talking about ? About Angie . Hello ? Nobody 's gonna follow you anywhere ever when they hear just exactly who you are . The military plans to launch a powerful missile in the hopes of destroying the dome . All right , everybody , stay put , remain calm . Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET I can 't believe it . The dome 's still here . Good thing they evacuated everyone outside . Hey , you guys okay ? - We saw the missile hit the dome . - Didn 't even put a dent in it . What 's it made of if a bomb couldn 't blow it up ? She 's right . How is that possible ? I don 't know . Nothing about this thing makes any sense . You can say that again . Still smooth as a baby 's butt . Stay back . Stay back , everyone . Remember Sheriff Perkins ? Touching that thing exploded his damn pacemaker . Norrie ! Mom ! - Oh , God , are you okay ? - I 'm sorry I ran off . If anything had happened to you ... Linda , where are your deputies ? Who do you think I 'm trying to find ? Have you seen Junior ? He didn 't evacuate to the factory with everyone else . Yeah , I know , I 've been looking for him myself . But he 's a big boy . He can handle himself . Yeah , well , I can 't say the same about Reverend Coggins . Carter found his body by the dome where we had Visitors ' Day . Good Lord . - Coggins is dead ? - His hearing aid exploded . He must have touched the dome and it just fried him . First Duke , now the Reverend ? How many more of us is this thing gonna kill ? Just take it easy , Ollie . You 're scaring people , okay ? It 's a little too late for that now . We 've got a right to know what 's going on . We 've all banded together before and we survived , okay ? - Yeah , until we run out of food in here . - How about electricity ? - I 'm nearly out of propane . - Hell , I ran out yesterday . Been warming up canned soup in my fireplace . I suggest we take this to a town-hall meeting . We can ... What , so you can keep jawing while more people die ? Hey , my jawing 's gotten us through plenty , Ollie . Why don 't you help by keeping your damn head on straight ? Can we please just get out of here ? Yeah , before a fight breaks out . - It 's like a hundred degrees today . - Let 's get back to the car . Joe , you can come with us . Honestly , I 'm a little scared . What happens when we run out of everything ? What do we do then ? I don 't know . The walkies aren 't working . I can 't get a frequency . Hey , Barbie , till I can reach my deputies , I 'm gonna need another hand . I 'll help you , but I don 't need your badge . Come on , I 'll give you a lift into town . We can talk about how this will work . I 'm gonna head over to the radio station . See if they 're picking anything up from the outside . - I 'll see you later ? - Yeah , okay . You know what this means , folks . We 're never getting out of here . Ollie , at least you have a farm to feed yourself . What about the rest of us ? You have my word , people . No one 's gonna starve in Chester 's Mill . It 's crazy . Five minutes ago , I thought we were gonna die . It 's worse not knowing what 's next . You don 't need to be scared , Angie . Didn 't you notice I 'm a deputy now ? People trust me , just like you should . Whatever happens , I 'll take care of you . Angie , don 't do this ! Angie ! Angie ! Just let me out of the car . Let me out of the car . Why 'd you make me stop ? What 's wrong ? I just ... I need some air . It 's boiling hot in there . - Mom , are you okay ? - She 's fine . Alice , just get back in the car . I 'll blast the a.c. - What time 's our flight ? - What flight ? - To L.A. I don 't wanna miss it . - Mom , watch out ! Mom ! Oh , my God . Hurry . - Are you okay ? - Sir , are you okay ? - Go , go , grab him ! - I 've got you . We 're gonna get you out , okay ? Help me get him out . Everybody okay ? What happened ? Alice didn 't see the truck coming . The driver swerved and hit the tower . Joe and Norrie pulled him out just in time . Okay , got him . Good job , you guys . The pipe 's a goner . Where 's your tower get its water from ? Lake Eastpointe . It 's our main source . Well , we 'll haul water from there . In the meantime , we should check it out . Okay , look at me , look at me . Alice , when 's the last time you took your insulin ? I ran out . With the bomb craziness and everything , I just ... I lost track . Come on , we 're gonna get you to the clinic right now . - What 's wrong with your mom ? - She 's a diabetic . Kind of loses it when she forgets to take her insulin . What is that noise ? I don 't know , but it 's jamming our broadcast . Kind of sounds like the alien from Aliens . Well , all the police walkies are making the same sound . Is Dodee picking up any military chatter from outside the dome ? Screech is jamming that too . And if it 's this loud , then the source is probably close . - How close ? - Best guess ? Mile or two . So it 's inside Chester 's Mill ? Listen , if it 's that close , maybe we can find it . One step ahead of you , Julia . Do I even wanna know what that is ? Us radio heads call it a yagi . I rigged it to locate the source of the screech using frequency triangulation . Look , whatever this screech is , it can 't be a coincidence that it started just as the missile was about to hit the dome . You think the dome was trying to scream ? - Or protect itself . - Who knows ? But if it was , it might be what 's generating the dome itself . We just have to follow the signal to the power source . Well , if that 's true , then if we can track it down ... Maybe we can turn it off . It 's none of my business , but you 're lucky to have her . Her ? I have eyes , you know . Oh , Julia and I aren 't exactly an item . Well , from the sparks that I saw flying , you should be . I 'd kill to have Rusty back right now . - How long you two been together ? - Three years . We 're supposed to get married next month . But now it just seems like some dream I made up . What the hell ? You shouldn 't be out . I was just here the other day . You had insulin . We have 23 diabetics in Chester 's Mill . Our insulin supply is gone . Pharmacy has to have some . When Reverend Coggins ransacked the place , he took all of the drugs , including the insulin . What are we supposed to do ? Pray . Jim , we have a situation . - The water tower ... - Yeah , I know , it fell . We 'll just have to get our water from Lake Eastpointe . Can 't . What are you doing ? This is the water from the lake . It 's polluted with methane . Must 've cut through an underground mineral pocket when the dome came down . So it 's undrinkable . Yeah , until we figure out how to filter it . What about rain ? Is that dome high enough for storm clouds to form ? I have no idea . You know , not too many people take the time to get to know their town . A shame , really . There 's history here . Right in our own backyards . My grandfather gave me this map when I was a kid . I used to spend hours poring over it , learning the lay of the land . There are artesian wells underneath Chester 's Mill . Now , some have dried up by now , but this one here is still flowing strongly . It 's right under Ollie Densmore 's place . And I 'm guessing he owns the rights . - We have to go see him . - No , no . I 've known Ollie long enough to know that he can be a pain in the ass , so I 'll go talk to him . Dad . Where you been ? You okay ? I can 't find Angie . - She 's gone . - Was she with you - when the bomb went off ? - Yeah , but she got away . Well , then find her . If she opens her mouth about being locked up ... Now , I 've been looking for her . Besides , you 're the one who let her go . Damn it , don 't you put this on me , Junior . This is your mess . And right now I got one of my own , so for once in your life , do your own damage control . Get out there and find that girl . Hey , so how long has Big Jim known Ollie Densmore ? The way Duke told it , all their lives . Jim and Ollie would be friends one day and then enemies the next . They 'd patch it up over a burger , but they 'd be fighting about something new the following week . And speaking of fighting , we should probably check this out . Folks , listen , I 'm sorry , but the only payment I can accept is either propane or batteries . So our money 's no good now ? I mean , we got cash . And we 've been waiting out here forever . Terry , what 's going on here ? I 'm just trying to explain the new reality to these people . Look , I can 't feed my family with money no one 's gonna take . New reality ? - Sounds like a scam to me . - I 'm not trying to ... - Hey , come on , guys , come on . - Is it true the lake is ruined ? - I hear we 're gonna run out of water . - If we haven 't already . Starting a panic is not gonna help anyone . All right ? So does anybody here have batteries that we can loan to Dres ? Anybody ? Thank you . There 's no need for alarm . I 'm sorry for making a scene . Thank you , sheriff . You really believe that ? No need for alarm ? Rule number one of law enforcement : You always believe in the goodness of people you serve . That 's what Duke taught me on the first day of the job . - Yeah , and if they prove you wrong ? - Rule number two : You do what you gotta do . - That 's not a good idea . - Why ? I mean , didn 't you have a gun - when you chased after Randolph ? - Yeah , but Randolph killed Freddy . These people ... These people are scared . To tell you the truth , so am I. Ollie ! Hey ! I won 't take up too much of your time . All the time in the world for you , Big Jim . - We got a water problem . - That concerns me , uh , how ? You got a well , and the people of Chester 's Mill could really use your help . - What 's in it for me ? - How about a sense of civic pride ? That 's typical . You always take me for granted , Jim . All us farmers . Till now . You still sore the town council took Kip Lester 's side on that fence dispute ? That so-called fence dispute lost me seven acres of my farm . It was 15 years ago , Ollie . That 's a drop in the bucket compared to how long you and me go back . I figured I could 've counted on you . You know the law tied my hands on that . Like that 's stopped you before now . - Damn it , be reasonable , Ollie . - That 's exactly what I 'm being . You want my water , you 'll have to pay for it . Today at the dome , you were talking about running low on propane . You know , the propane it takes to run your irrigation system and light your house . Let me guess . You have some . - Plenty . - Heh . Why am I not surprised Big Jim Rennie just happens to have what Chester 's Mill needs in its moment of crisis ? It 's nothing sinister , Ollie . Town keeps a reserve in case of emergency . You get me propane , town gets its water . - Just in time . - Things getting out of control ? Not yet , but the mood 's pretty ugly . Barbie , get inside and keep peace at the register . Carter , slow the flow of people going inside . Junior , where have you been all morning ? Sorry , Linda , I got a situation I need to take care of . - I 'm looking for someone . - Well , I need you to do your job . Ladies and gentlemen , due to demand , we are now limiting each customer 's purchase to a total of two liters of water . Work the aisles . Just keep smiling and stay alert . Waylon , Clint , put it back . Well , isn 't this cute ? Little Big Jim playing cop . - Drop those and step back . - Or what ? - You gonna teach us a lesson ? - If I have to . Hey , come on . Are you serious ? Hey ! I was here first ! - My son is sick . I need this ! - I don 't care ! Hey , hey , come on , ladies . Hey , knock it off . Knock it off . Joe , what am I gonna do ? I can 't just let my mom die . Not like this . Tell me how to help . I 'll do anything . Where are you going ? Nurse said there 's a bunch of other diabetics in town . Their files have to be in here somewhere . You think people will just give you their insulin if you ask ? Who said I was gonna ask ? - Norrie ... - If you don 't like it , don 't come . Are we getting closer to the signal ? No . What ? Our source , all of a sudden , it 's moving . - What kind of a power source moves ? - I 'm not sure . All right , well , let 's see if we can home in on it . Carter ! Hold it , hold it . What do we got ? No , no , no . - Angie , where have you been ? - Oh . Rose . Are you okay ? Junior , he ... What ? Junior what ? The day that the dome came down , Junior locked me in his fallout shelter . - What ? - I tried to escape , but I couldn 't . - And then Big Jim found me . - And he let you out . - No , he locked me in again . - Big Jim did ? And the only reason he let me out this morning is because he thought this missile was gonna kill us all . I can 't believe Big Jim would do something like that . Rose , I 'm not lying . When he finally let me out , I ran . And ran and I ran to my parents ' house . - I couldn 't find Joe . - Oh . - I couldn 't find my brother . - Oh . Your brother is safe and so are you . But Junior 's a cop now . And his dad 's a councilman . Who 's gonna believe my word against theirs ? I do . I do . Don 't you worry , honey . We 'll make sure that everybody else does too . - Are you sure a diabetic lives here ? - Yeah . Name 's on the medical files I pulled . Ray Garcia , 341 Cupidas Drive . Yeah , well , no one 's home . Can we come back later ? Joe , we don 't want them to be home . Plus maybe they got caught outside the dome . Wait , wait , Norrie , we can 't just ... What are you kids doing ? My mom needs insulin . So you figured you 'd steal mine ? She 's ... She 's gonna die . Just like the rest of us . I took my last dose yesterday . Now go on , get out of here before I blow your damn heads off . Back up ! Move ! No , no , no ! Stop ! Let her go ! - No ! - Get your hands off me ! Get your hands off of her . Go to hell ! Out of the way . Move it ! Move ! Barbie . Barbie , get ahold of yourself . Can I count on you ? It won 't happen again . This thing is starting to spread . We need to do something and fast . Carter , come with me . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? We know that you still got meat in that freezer of yours . Yeah . And it doesn 't belong to either of you . You don 't get it , Rose . We 're stuck in here with no water . Food 's running out . A bomb couldn 't even crack that damn thing . So we 're just gonna take what we want . - Aah ! - Right after you kiss my ass ! No ! Rose ! You bastard ! Aah ! - Where have you been ? - At the station . I remembered Duke telling me about some riot gear the feds sent us after 9 / 11 . This is it ? This stuff is ... It 's ten years old . It loses effectiveness . Get ready to clear the crowd . Tear gas isn 't working . Slow down , slow down . - Damn it ! - Now what ? I lost the signal . - How ? - I don 't know , just give me a second . Wait , wait , wait , it 's back . Hurry , hurry , go . - Okay , all right . - We 're close . The door 's unlocked . It 's not like we 're breaking in . Now say it like you mean it . Nore ? What are you doing here ? We were just , um ... - Where are your parents ? - Mom went to the store . Dad can 't get back home with that dome thing outside . We 're not gonna hurt you . I 'm not scared . Mom says I 'm not a little boy anymore . I even do my own shots now . - You have diabetes ? - Yeah , but it 's not a big deal . Take these back to the fridge . Wait . What the hell are you doing here ? Get out . I 'm sorry . It was a stupid idea . You were right . Let 's just go back to your mom 's . Hey , Joe . What are you guys doing here ? - Uh , we were just ... - Out on a walk . What are you guys doing ? - Wild-goose hunt . - Not anymore . The signal 's coming from right here . From this house ? I think it 's coming from them . What 's this ? It 's my end of the deal . Got what you want , Ollie . So be prepared for townfolk to start coming over and getting their water . Well , it 's a good start , anyway . Need another delivery about a week from now . You know , I could always seize that well , you backwoods son of a bitch . And I 'm sure you 'd find some bylaw or loophole to justify doing it . I mean , that 's always been the Big Jim way , hasn 't it ? - But not anymore . - What 's that supposed to mean ? It means I don 't give a rat 's ass what piece of official paper you pull out . You step foot on my land except to bring me more propane , you 'll get a bullet between the eyes . I always could shoot better than you . Be careful , Ollie . Times like this , you don 't wanna stand alone . Cross me . We 'll see who stands where . Yeah , Junior 's girl really put up a fight . She can 't now . Go watch the door , Clint . Angie McAlister . I don 't think you 're gonna mind . Wait , this is our fault ? So you think we 're what 's jamming all the frequencies in town ? All we know is , whatever this signal thing is , it started today and it led us straight to you guys . Yeah , but why today ? I mean , it 's not like we did anything . - I know it doesn 't make any sense . - It sort of does . - We have to tell someone . - Tell us what ? The day the dome came down , we both started having seizures . All the people who 've seen us seize have said that we said something . The exact same thing . - Okay , I 'm officially freaked out . - Here . - Pink stars are falling in lines . - Pink stars are falling . - Pink stars are falling . - Pink stars are falling . - Pink stars are falling in lines . - Pink stars are falling in lines . - Pink stars are falling ... - Pink stars are falling ... Hey , break it up ! Sorry , man , diner 's closed . When did Rose make you the doorman ? - Rose ? - Yeah . Waylon , get out of there ! Hey ! What happened ? Rose is dead . Angie 's got a nasty bump on her head . Rose ? - Oh , my God . - I need your keys . I gotta get her to the clinic . Damn it . Someone slashed the tires . It 's time for rule number two . Stop . Stop ! It can rain ! It can rain inside the dome ! It 's rain ! Came out of nowhere ! All right ! Don 't just stand there , folks . Grab a bucket , grab a trash can ! We need to save every drop we can ! Now , come on ! Hey , I gotta get her to the clinic . Can you take her ? Of course ! Is that Angie McAlister ? What happened ? Looters . They broke in to the diner . They knocked her out . And Rose ... What about Rose ? She 's dead . Two guys . One kept calling the other one Waylon ? Sounds like the Dundee brothers . Find them . Dome 's still here . Outside it 's totally dry . How is it only raining in here ? The dome must have its own microclimate . The water from the lake evaporates , but the dome traps it inside . But the beautiful thing about the evaporation process is it filters the water so you can drink it . Guess we 're not gonna run out of water after all . Yeah , great . So now we can spend the rest of our lives inside this damn thing . Whoa . Radio 's working again . Whatever was jamming the airwaves is gone . It 's because Joe and Norrie touched the dome together . What the hell does that mean ? Don 't look at me . You know what ? I don 't have time for this . - I 've gotta get to my mom . - I 'll drive you . No , the clinic 's not far . I 'll walk . You come with . They 're connected to it . It 's like the dome is using them . Okay . - How ? - I don 't know yet . We could have died today in that missile strike . And instead , the dome ended up protecting us . And just when we need water , it rains . I mean , this can 't just be a coincidence . Okay , so , what , now the dome 's helping us ? Maybe . Maybe it 's trying to reassure us . First it traps us . Now it 's trying to reassure us . No . No , there 's nothing warm and fuzzy about this , Julia . And we need to tell someone about them . Big Jim 's gonna know what to do . Do you have any idea what will happen if word gets out about those kids ? The whole town will be after them . Until we know what this is , we can 't tell anyone . Fine . For now . I don 't know how you guys came up with this , but I 'm glad you did . When she needs her next dose ? Let 's just be happy she 's better for now . Okay . Barbie , I 've been looking for you . You okay ? Yeah . You okay ? Yeah , it 's , uh ... It 's been a hell of a crazy day . Yeah , I guess you could say everybody went a little crazy today . We 're gonna be okay . Hello ? I 'd take it easy if I were you . What ... ? What is going on ? Barbie found you knocked out in the diner . Rose . She needs help . I 'm afraid it 's too late . She was a good friend to me . What ... ? What am I doing here ? You can 't lock me up again . No , no , the front door 's open . You can leave any time you like . Though I was hoping that you and I could come to an arrangement . Junior kidnapped me . No amount of money can pay for that . You 'll get no argument from me . You know , deep down , I think I always knew something was off with my son , ever since his mom died . I guess I just couldn 't admit it to myself . So I 'm not talking about giving you money . I 'm offering you my word . Your word ? Junior Rennie will never touch you again . I 'll make sure of it . And , uh , well , I mean , if you need money , or what counts as money in town these days , you know , propane , food , water , a gun , you 'll have it . If you will just try to put this terrible event behind you , I 'll get you anything your little heart desires . What about Joe ? I need to know that my brother will be taken care of too . Done . We can be friends . And , uh ... Trust me , times like these , it 's good to have a friend like ... Big Jim Rennie . I don 't know . I have to think about it . Dad . Angie . What 's going on here ?

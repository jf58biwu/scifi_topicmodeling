 Huxley Station . Ugh , shit . Sorry . Next stop , Huxley Station . Next train to New York City will be departing on Platform 8B in 10 minutes . Next train to New York City , Platform 8B in 10 minutes . Hey , hey ! It 's Sarah . Yeah , I 'm ... I 'm back in town . I wanna see Kira , okay ? Well , that 's not fair , is it ? Can I at least speak to her ? Hello ? Bitch . Stop the train ! Stop the train ! Stop the train ! Somebody help . No ! Get some help down here , now ! Elizabeth Childs . Two phones . Oh , my God . You look like crap . - Hi ! - Hello ! No , seriously , ew ! All right . How 's life , Felix ? This long no see , you don 't get to know . I didn 't miss your birthday , did I ? No , I know . It 's totally pedestrian , the only reason I 'm here . - Oi , Bobby . - Hey , Felix . - Guinness ? - Yeah . How 's Vic the dick ? Yeah , I hit him first this time . With an ashtray , so ... He 's a little blue . - Coke ? - It 's Vic 's . Think you can flip it to one of your Bay Street blow boys ? You have no idea what that costs me . I 'll give you 20 % . I wasn 't talking about my cut , Sarah . I was talking about my pride . What are you up to ? I 'm here for Kira , Fe . After what happened , you really think Mrs. S is gonna let you take her ? She 's my daughter , she 's gonna have to . You 've been gone for almost a year , Sarah . I 'm not judging , I 'm just saying . All right . Ta ! Yeah , so I 'm back on the run , the usual Sarah shite storm . Apparently . Well , on that note , something really weird just happened at the train station . What ? I saw a girl kill herself . Ew ! A jumper ? Yeah , and she looked exactly like me , Felix . What do you mean ? Oh , you robbed her body . No , she left her bag on the platform . Ain 't that essentially robbing her body ? Okay , that 's weird . Yeah , you think ? Elizabeth Childs . It 's you with a nice haircut . And a nice address . What the hell , Fe , did I have a twin sister ? Well , now , when you 're a poor little orphan foster wretch , anything 's possible . Or so we tell ourselves . I 'm gonna go up to her flat . Yeah , to find out who she is , to rob the rest of her shit . Or car . There has to be a car . Is that her phone ? - Yeah . - Well , answer it . Try and get 20k for it , yeah ? All right , fine . What about Vic ? I 'll call ya . - Okay . - Okay ? Okay . Hello ? Boyfriend . Squares . Paul Deardon . Out of town till Saturday . Well ... Shitful quality . I 'll give you 1 0 for it . 1 0 ? With the hay roll ? You can do better . - I 'll think about it . Think fast . - Okay . - Okay ! Shit . - What ? Oh , shit . - Where the hell is Sarah ? - Where is she ? - Vic , I can 't breathe . - Oh ! - Sarah ! Sarah ! - What the hell is wrong with you ? - Move . Where the hell is Sarah ? - Toodles . - Where is she ? I don 't know . I haven 't seen her in like a year . She 's been with you . - Bullshit ! - She 's not my problem anymore . Listen to me , Felix , I 'm just gonna ask you once . Where is the coke ? Cocaine ? Felix ? All right , fine . Here . Blow me . That 's really funny . What the hell happened to your head ? Well , let 's see , Sarah blindsided me , then she took off with the coke . Listen to me ! Listen to me . Listen , I 'm on the hook with Pouchy . Look at me , you understand ? Look at me . That 's gonna bring pain on me . Till I find her , it 's on you . You mind if I have this ? I 'll be back , she better be here , fruitcake . Lovely to see you again , Victor . Sarah . It 's Beth . So , my credit is max , but ... I 've got a sweet pad and my new boyfriend , Paul 's , out of town till the weekend . Unfortunately , your real boyfriend , Vic the dick , - is already here . - Shit ! Oh , I 'm fine , by the way , thank you . I 'm sorry , Fe . And your blow is abysmal , by the way . - I 'll be lucky to get 1 0k for it . - What ? That 's not enough . - For what ? - To get out , Fe . Set ourselves up with Kira somewhere . Sarah , who is Elizabeth Childs ? I don 't know . Just a girl who looks like me . Girl with a pretty nice life . If it was so nice , why did she kill herself ? Hold on . Fe ? She 's got $ 75,000 in her savings account . Say again ? 75k . The account was just opened like three weeks ago . That 's enough to lose bloody Vic , yeah ? We can get away with this , Fe . The three of us . Sarah , any second , someone 's gonna ID the body , and it 's game over . So you should really just drop it all right now . Nice work , with the ashtray , by the way . Vic has stitches . - Hello ? - I 'm standing outside - Huxley Station , right now , - Shh , shut up , I 'm thinking . which we can see is emptying out . Authorities have cleared out the station after an unidentified woman fell onto the tracks and was killed . Our witnesses aren 't sure how the woman came to be on the tracks , or whether foul play was involved . Fe , I have an idea . All right , give me a big smile . - I want a big smile . - Why are you shooting me ? 'Cause I love shooting . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Oh , shit . Drugstore counter . What 's up , hot stuff ? Are you ready to push your body ... You 're damn right . You 're damn ... You 're damn ... You 're damn right . Sorry , Art . Whoever you are . I 'm gone for good . You 're damn right . Hi , uh , Beth Childs . I have an appointment with the manager . Stephen Riggs . Sure , I 'll let him know you 're here . Ugh ! - Felix ! - Ow ! Use it or hang it up , okay ? Do not snap towels at me , Bobby . I had a very traumatic childhood . Yeah , hi , um ... Oh , totally awful . Apparently , a girl killed herself at Huxley Station last night , and I think I know her . Sarah . Sarah Manning . - Beth ? Good to see you again . - Yeah , hi . - How are you ? Yeah , good , Stephen . Thanks . Um , busy ? Appeared last week at 2 : 14 . It was only a half but it almost killed me . - Hmm . - How 'd you do your last charity run ? I ... Don 't know , in fact . I need to make a large withdrawal from that account . I see , that is the one you just opened . Yeah , I 'll leave 500 in to keep the account open . But I need , um , the rest . - In cash , please ? - Cash ? - Yeah . - I really recommend a cashier 's check , if you ... Uh , no . 50s and 1 00s , please . Well , we don 't keep that much on hand . See , anything over $ 1 0,000 , we have to special order and that takes two to four business days . - So ... Stephen ... What can I do to , uh ... To put a rush on that . You know , 24 hours . Could I , um , sponsor your next charity run thing ? - You certainly can . Deal . But ... This card is ... Oh , I 'm not even sure I 've activated that , yet . If I did , I need to re-pin it . Demagnetize , maybe ? Yeah , you know what ? Let 's start with a new one . And then we 'll organize the withdrawal . Okay . Do you want access to your safe deposit box as well ? - Oh , yeah . I 'd ... I 'd love that , Stephen . - Sure . " Where are you ? " " Must see you . " And good luck with that . Alison Hendrix . Elizabeth Childs . Katja Obinger . What the hell are you doing ? Shit .

Where were you ? We 're gonna walk through it again . Uh , yeah . Yeah , I got held up . - Don 't worry about it . - I worry . Suddenly , you don 't give a damn , I get pissed . My fat ass is on the line here , too . Now you had better be ready . Are you ready ? Yeah . Yeah , I 'm ready . You 're sure as hell overdressed . What ? Were you out all night or something ? No , you know what , give me a ... A second , I 'll go in and change . Right . You 'll probably take off on me again . Look , Beth , I know this shit is as hard as it gets . But you gotta stop making it worse . Art , just drive . Oh , is that her ? Yes . Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm good . Oh , Colin , um ... Can I call you Colin ? My mom does . Oh , um ... Well , don 't get me wrong , I usually do enjoy creepy , I do , it 's just , um ... The air in here or is that just me because it smells like ... Uh , no ... It 's death . You can do this , though . It can be a ... - A gestalt . - Oh , my . Holy shite . Let 's go . Hey , good luck , Beth . Fashionably late , you called it . She 's here , Lieutenant . Then get busy . Detective , come with me . Show 's over . Oh ! Stick to your statement and you will be fine . Okay ? I gotta , um , I gotta use a washroom , Lieutenant . All right , get yourself sorted . Detective . Yeah ? Washroom 's this way . Right . Felix , Beth is a cop . I 'm a cop . Felix , abort . This will be shocking , Felix . But for her it was instant . - Okay ? - Okay . Oh , my God ... I ... Oh , that 's ... That 's so ... Oh , I can 't ... I can 't do it . I need to ... That 's ... This is too messed up , I can 't . - That 's okay , you can lean on me , it 's fine . - All right . Thank you . Water . Delicious . Is it her ? Yeah . Your sister , I 'm very sorry . Foster sister , but we were very close . You know , we spent all of our , um , formative years together . Right . Okay , well , uh , there 's a few things you need to sign . Um ... But ... If you , um ... If you need ... Want anyone to talk to ... Um ... You know , over a drink or ... Well , aren 't you an odd duck ? All right , statement of Officer Elizabeth Childs , entering into record her version of the line-of-duty shooting on the 7th October of this year , resulting in a civilian fatality , one Margaret Chan . In your own words , please , begin by stating your name . Anytime , Detective . I panicked . What do you want me to say ? Pretty much anything , but " I panicked " . I 'm kidding . Where 's your wit gone ? You haven 't called me dipshit all day . You don 't have to babysit me , dipshit . I know . But who else would ? Thanks , Doc . See you next week . Look , Beth , I know this thing has got you all twisted up , but you gotta forgive yourself . Shootings happen , to whoever 's there , with a gun in their hand . Hmm . Dr. Bower will see you now . - Felix , open the goddamn door . Felix , I know you 're in there , open the door now . Oh . You bastard . What the hell is wrong with you ? Huh ? Where 's Sarah ? Sarah is dead . I 'm sorry , what ? She 's dead . - Vic ... She killed herself . Yeah ? Bullshit . Where is she , Felix ? She jumped in front of a train because you are such an arsehole ! What 's this ? Her death certificate . Bullshit . It 's not real . I identified her body . - Vic , she 's dead ! She 's gone . - Okay , Felix , stop it . Stop ! Stop it . She told you to say this ? She 's not dead . Where is she ? Stupid bitch . Sarah ? - It 's not coming back to you ? - Hmm ... No , I 'm ... I 'm ... Not really . Uh , I ... I know I shot a civilian . Maggie Chan ? 44 , single , churchgoer . I 'm just missing , uh ... Missing what ? Explain . Uh ... Myself . Um ... Yeah , um , I glitched . Break or something . I think I need some leave . You 're under suspension . Right . See , I 'm having trouble with detail . So , I 'm not sure I should say anything at all . It 's okay . It 's all confidential . Have you shared any of these dissociations with Paul ? Yeah , no ... We 're fine . I don 't wanna talk about Paul . Paul 's away . No , he 's in Cleveland . Beth ... Uh , waitress makes a mistake at work , she , what , drops a plate of meat loaf , doesn 't get a tip . - Hmm ... - Try to separate mistake from result . Getting back on the job for you is all about moving forward from a moment you can never take back . You need to talk to me about that moment . About seeing cell phone and reacting gun . Mmm-hmm . Can I make another appointment ? So , your twin , all hopped up on cop tranquilizers , guns down an innocent Chinese lady holding a cell phone in her hand . - Is that true ? I don 't know . I 'm not even sure her partner knows . Feels like she 's lying about something . For 75 grand in a new account . She well dodgy . Yeah , whatever she was into drove her plenty nuts , yeah . Yeah . Suicide 's thrilling , agreed . But ... Can we get the elephant out of the room ? What ? Well , look at her . You 're related . This could be your story . It 's not . - Every foster kid dreams of their lost family . - Oh , my God ! Deep down we all hope we 're special . Yeah , the last thing I am is special . If that was my boyfriend , I 'd jump in front of a train too . Don 't say that . Paul 's hot and you know it . Oh , Vic ... Is keening like a banshee . He wants a funeral . He can 't have a funeral ! The whole sad point is nobody would notice if I died . What 's this ? Birth certificates ? Alison Hendrix , Beth , Katja Obinger , born in Berlin ? So their birthdays are all within a month of yours ? It 's a coincidence . I don 't care . It 's just a score , Fe . Let me finish what I started and then , I 'll come back for you and Kira , yeah ? Oh ! You 're gonna disappear again ? Yeah , I have to , Fe . It 's dangerous shit in this life . - Somebody keeps texting her . - Oh , texting ! My God , how terrifying ! Look , Fe , sell the coke , and keep half the money and give the other half to Kira , yeah ? You left Kira with Mrs. S overnight and you didn 't come back for 1 0 months . I 'm trying to fix this . Tell it to the angels , Sarah . You 're already dead . Shit . Beth ? Beth ? Hi . Hey . " The Clash " ? Oh , yeah , uh ... London calling . The Clash rock . Yeah , but you don 't . - Are you going somewhere ? - Uh ... Uh , no . Just gym stuff . Weren 't you coming back on the weekend ? Well , I wanted to be here . So ... - Yeah ? - How was the hearing ? Oh , uh ... I couldn 't do it . I couldn 't do it . You skipped it ? Um , no ... Um ... I got sick to my stomach , I basically puked on them . Are you serious ? Yeah . Yeah . Don 't worry , I 'm okay . Beth , what 's happened ? A lot . Yeah , I know , but you 're ... I 'm what ? What did you do to your hair ? Uh ... Nothing . I got it cut . It 's longer . It 's just wet . Something 's different . - Bedroom . - Mmm-hmm . Right here . - Felix ? - For crying out loud . Felix ? I 'm sorry , man . I don 't know where else to go . A men 's shelter ? What the hell happened to your face ? Got in a fight . Why , Vic ? Why are you such a dick ? I don 't know , I 'm angry . - Can I come in ? - No ! Thanks . I can 't sleep . I keep seeing her face . Yeah , me too . Her pretty face . Felix , you and me , we have to do something . There 's just no goddamn closure , bro . We have to have like a ... A memorial send-off or something . Okay , Vic . We 'll have a wake . Really ? See , that 's what I 'm talking about , man . - A coming together . - Yeah . - Cremation 's today . I 'm buying . - Oh , shit . Yeah , it can 't be today . I 've got to call Glenn , that bitch Sherry , her Montreal connections ... - No , no , no , no , no . - ... are gonna wanna be there . Locals only , Vic . Fast and light , all right ? It 's gonna be an intimate memorial piss-up . - Okay . - Come on , let 's go . - Just ... - Can I ... Okay . - That 's ... All right , um ... - Thank you . You know what , first though , you need a shower and a Xanax . Okay . - Mmm ... - Oh ! For real ? That was amazing . Was it ? Where you been hiding that accent for like two years ? Uh , I got up for the gym , Paul . Okay . Well , you want to tell me what happened at the hearing ? Uh , I choked , I guess , um ... They reconvene in a couple of days , so don 't worry about it . Beth . Hmm . What ? Are you back on the meds ? No . Then you didn 't choke . You 're just finally feeling something . Feeling like the real you . I got up for the gym . Are you driving today ? What ? Uh , can I borrow the keys to your car ? - Use your own car . - Can 't find my keys . Did you check the thing where they always are ? Yep . Yeah , I checked the thing where they always are . Mmm . Nice . Felix , we can 't part angry this time . It 's not good for your skin , okay . Call me or I 'll squeeze your bloody bollocks in a vise ... Everything all right ? Oh , yeah . Obnoxious English relative . Well , I 've got your cash . I just need your signature here . Thank you . All right , then . All done . Here . Okay . Good luck with that run . Fe ! Felix . You little shit . " Sarah had a big heart . " It was always fight or flight with her . " You guys remember how she was , right ? It 's all based on facts . " She was the kind of person you want to hang on to " but she would not be held with you . " Sarah , I 'm sorry . " I know , I 've a lot to answer for . " My favorite moment ... " So , is it heaven or hell ? I didn 't want a funeral for this very reason , Fe . Well , you can 't do much about that when you 're dead , can you ? I 'm watching , right now . Really ? Oh ! Oh ! - Pathetic . - Let me ask you ... I dressed Vic . How do we look ? Yeah , not as good as Rockabilly Bob . Who knows , still Rockabilly after all these years . Got to respect that . Sherry is upset though , isn 't she ? Oh , yes . She thinks Vic pushed you in front of the train . It 's priceless , really . Eh , I 've got the money , Fe . I still want us to be together , it can work , yeah ? This is our chance for me , you and Kira to start over . - Sarah ... - Felix , do you mind ? I 'm trying to ... Do you want us to go and come back ? Shit , I 'm sorry ... Vic 's getting mad , I gotta go . Could you ... Could you hang up your phone ? - Oh , shit . - What ? Mrs. S is here , Fe . Shit ! Stop ! Stop ! Stop ! Oh , shit . No , no , no , Fe . Oh , shit . Oh , no , Fe . Kira 's there . She can 't think I 'm dead , Fe . Fe ! Oh , God . She can 't think I 'm dead . Beth ... Beth , why don 't you respond to me ? - Beth . - Just keep away from me . Beth , it 's Katja . - Oh , my God ... - Why no meeting , Beth ? What 's happening ? - I ... - I brought the briefcase . Yeah , the samples for your friend , Beth . I was careful , like you said . Yeah , I just ... Just stay back . I 'm Katja . Katja Obinger , Beth . Yeah , I get it . The German . Okay , I 've seen your birth certificate . Yeah , you asked for it . For proof . Please , I need to see your scientist friend , Beth . Ah , I can 't help you . - Get out of the car ! - Why are you doing this ? Your partner , he was following you . You were the one in the black car ? The one that flashed your lights . Yeah . You need to go . You 're police , Beth ? - We need to ... - Don 't . Get out ! Just one . I 'm a few , no family , too . Who am I ? You 're not Beth . Oh , God ! Shit . Shit ! Shit . Hello . This is not Sarah , it 's not Sarah . We 've been here before . No , Paul . We definitely haven 't been here before . - Shit . - Hey , hey ! Whoa , whoa ! Take it easy . Are you wearing a wire ?

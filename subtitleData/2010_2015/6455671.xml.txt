 Previously on 24 ... We pay you to develop the override , not for you to give it away to the rest of the world . You 're working with Cheng ? Are you insane ? Cheng kidnapped Jack , had him put in a secret prison outside of Beijing and tortured him for over a year . When Audrey went to go look for him , he did the same thing to her . I really don 't have any use for you anymore . Send it . Fire order . We 're to sink the Chinese carrier Shenyang . Fire torpedoes one and two ! Mr. President , we know who issued the false order that sank your carrier . Cheng Zhi . Cheng is dead . We have reliable evidence that he 's alive and he 's here in England . Our carrier sinking and the deaths of thousands of crewmen is a brazen act of war that cannot go unanswered . It 's imperative that you find Cheng and the override device , so that we can show the Chinese that we were not responsible . Bauer is still in the picture . You were supposed to have taken him out . I sent a team to recover him . He 's not gonna stop until he finds me . My people will meet you at the dock . You 'll be out of the country in less than an hour . Bring the witness . What 's in her head is extremely valuable . You set me up for the Russians , you son of a bitch . Why ? ! I thought Bauer was a traitor . I thought he was here to assassinate you . The Russians have been pushing us for four years to turn him over to them . I forged your signature on the rendition order . I am placing you under arrest for treason . Mr. President , I can still use him . I 'm gonna need him to set up a meet . He 's bleeding out . Get me a towel now ! - Where is Cheng ? ! - My country has not forgotten . They will not give up until you pay for what you have done . I have a contact at the Chinese Embassy here in London . Let me arrange a meeting and I will bring evidence that the penetration of our systems was out of our control . Please take this to your father as quickly as possible . Jiao ... thank you . My associate has his weapon trained on you . Sit back down on the bench and don 't move . Maybe I 'll allow you to live . Jiao ? My God . I told you , you may not move from the bench . But my friend is still alive . Let me go see if I can help her . I won 't run . I give you my word . I 'm going to her to see if I can help her . Do not scream . Do not communicate with anyone in any way . Why are you doing this ? What do you want ? You move from the bench again , my sniper will kill you . Sit . Stolnavich 's e-mails all look like they 're personal . To family , different women . Could it be in some sort of code ? Stolnavich wouldn 't have kept something like that in the open , even if it was coded . I got e-mails from three days ago using a false name and arranging for payments for a shipment . Leaves tonight . Cheng 's got to be that shipment . He 's gonna be on a freighter from the harbor - in less than 40 minutes . - Okay , I 'll call it in . I 'll get Erik to send a team there right now . Oh , my God . What is it ? This is Agent Morgan . I 'm gonna need a team sent down to South Hampton . This time stamp ... this was taken less than a minute ago . Hang up the phone . - Hang up the phone now . - I 'll call back . Yes ? Stop tracking me . As soon as I 'm safely away , I will set her free . If you come near me or anyone try to help her , - she dies instantly . - Cheng , please listen to me ... Those are my terms ! Is that clear ? Yes . Cheng ? So ... it 's over . We ... We ... we can 't go after him . Getting to Cheng is the only way - we 're gonna stop this war with China . - You 're just assuming that . We don 't know if we can get the proof to President Wei ! Or even if he 'll back off when he gets it . We 're condemning Audrey to death for nothing . We don 't have another choice . She loves you . Shut up ! Agent Morgan . We can 't involve the CIA . Cheng will see them coming from a mile away . What 's the alternative ? He 's right , there isn 't one . I need to go after Audrey . Jack , you 're under a direct order from the president to go after Cheng ; you got to follow that . I can go after Audrey . You really think you can handle this ? Yes . Okay , I want you to contact Audrey 's office discreetly . Find out where she was going . Whatever you do , do not alert the CIA . I want you to put together a small team . You take out that sniper . You keep me posted every step of the way . I will . Mr. President , I 'm Agent Erik Ritter , acting head of station . Your military advisors are set up in our secure comm and briefing facilities upstairs . Well , thank you , Agent Ritter . Have you heard anything from Audrey ? I checked in on their Secret Service detail 15 minutes ago . She and Jiao Sim were still talking . What about Bauer ? Negative on Bauer , sir . What 's our status , Admiral ? The Chinese now have eight amphibious landing groups steaming toward our bases in Okinawa . The first Chinese carrier to reach the 12-mile limit will be in the next half hour . At which point , the seventh fleet has standing orders to engage . Also , they 've ordered their nuclear armed submarines to ascend to 300 feet ... firing depth . Sir , we need your authorization to escalate our own nuclear readiness in response . Put our subs and silos on the highest alert . See if you can get President Wei on the line . Right away , sir . Ma 'am , are you okay ? Are you all right , love ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Can I use your phone , please ? Yes . Yes , of course . Who is this ? Jack , it 's me . Chloe , where are you ? Cheng had me ; I jumped out of his truck . Adrian 's dead . I know . You got my message . You know he used the device to launch the attack on the Chinese carrier ? Yes , and if I capture Cheng alive and can prove his involvement in today 's attack , we might be able to get China to back down from war . Do you know where he is ? He 's leaving on a cargo ship . Belcheck 's meeting me down at the docks . You can 't go in there blind . I 'm at Millswood , not far from the docks . Come get me . I 'll run comm for you . I 'll get you satellites , schematics . Chloe , I don 't think that 's a good idea . Jack , I know you don 't trust me . Adrian lied to me . The only thing I did wrong was to believe him . Please , let me make this right . Give me your cross streets ; I 'll pick you up . President Wei , whenever you 're ready . Go . Mr. President . Forgive me for being blunt . You 've got your navy heading toward Okinawa , which our seventh fleet is ready to defend . But it 's in both our interests to avoid a shooting war . Especially with both our countries at a high-level of nuclear readiness . The destruction of our carrier and the deaths of our soldiers is a provocation . Our military must respond . We have agents in the field in the process of apprehending Cheng Zhi . While that 's happening , I 'm asking you , as a gesture of good faith , to halt your naval advance . Our military 's official position is that Cheng is dead . Myself and my allies in the Politburo must accept this is true , unless proven otherwise . You 've made yourself clear , Mr. President . Let me make myself clear . Once your forces cross the 12-mile limit outside of Okinawa ... we will fight . Get your men on board and out of sight . We are scheduled to depart in 15 minutes . Is there a way to expedite this ? That would draw scrutiny neither of us want . Chloe , get in . What the hell happened ? You okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I got banged up getting away from Cheng . We don 't have a lot of time . I 'll explain everything while we drive . Where is your communications setup ? The trunk in the backseat . Chloe , I need to know why you were with Adrian Cross when you took the override device . Jack , I tried to get the device from Adrian , but he had a gun . We got back to the base and Cheng was waiting . Adrian wasn 't who I thought he was . He manipulated me and he used my knowledge to create the device . So , this is partly my fault . That 's why I need to help you . I need to try to make this right . It 's up to you . At this point , I think I 'm the only friend you have left . Whether you want to admit it or not . The operation 's simple . Capture Cheng alive . Why are you doing this alone ? Why not ask the CIA for help ? Because he 's got Audrey pinned down by a sniper . He 'll kill her if he sees any operation moving against him . Jack , I 'm sorry . It 's not your fault , Chloe . You need to let that go . None of this is . Audrey , this is Kate Morgan . I 'm working with Jack Bauer . I 'm here to help you . It 's really important that you don 't react to what I 'm saying because we don 't want the sniper to know that you 're in communication with me . Okay ? Nod if you understand what I 'm saying . Okay , I need to know if you have any idea where the sniper is . Look down if the answer is no . Listen , I know Cheng doesn 't want to kill you . You 're gonna have to trust me on this . I 'm gonna need you to draw the sniper 's fire so that I can locate exactly where he is . Nod if you 're still with me on this . Okay , I 'm gonna count to three , and on three , I need you to make a sudden movement . Okay , ready ? One ... two ... three . I got him . Stay put and just know that I 'm out here , okay ? Jack . - What 's your status ? - I 've located the sniper , but I need to move into position so I can lay down some cover fire for Audrey to run . Copy that . Get back to me as soon as you 've got her secured . Got it . Four of us moving in is just gonna attract too much attention . I 'm gonna run point . The minute I have a clean line of sight , we move on my command . Did you get everything ? There are too many places for Cheng 's men to hide . That 's what I 'm here for . I should be able to backdoor a satellite and get their positions . Cellular modem 's not giving me a signal . I need to get online . I can wire into that dish . I need to reprogram the transponders . My comm is open . I 'll get back to you . Cover me . Chloe . Wait . Thank you ... for everything . And good luck . Go . Audrey , I 'm about to move into position where I can get a clean shot on the sniper . As soon as that happens , the second that you hear gunfire , I want you to run toward the tree behind your left shoulder . Okay , stand by . Jack , I 'm backdoored into a satellite overhead . Resolving the infrared . Okay , I can see you and Belcheck . You 're clear . Go . Stop , Jack . You have two guards coming straight at you . Ready ? Now . Jack , there 's another guy on top of the container . - Five o 'clock . - Got it . Turn here . Go . Jack , you 'll have to take out two guards on the port side . There are men on the bridge . They 're moving away . You 're good . Clear . Go . Copy that . Synchronized shot . I 've acquired target on the left ; you take target on the right . On my count . Three , two , one , fire . Chloe , we 're on the boat . Jack , you have a man at the top of the stairs to your left ; there 's another one on the container directly in front of you . I 'm picking up about a dozen other heat signatures on the ship , mostly in pairs . Copy that . What 's the status on Audrey ? I haven 't heard anything . Most of the men are in a defensive formation around the comm tower ... that must be where Cheng is . - Guide us in . - Okay . Sir . I 've been running scans ... someone in the immediate area is downstreaming with a local satellite . Roll-call your men . _ _ Whoever 's linking to the satellite , can you cut the access and the communication ? Yes , and I can redirect their feed to my screen . Do it . Contact whoever 's left . Tell them to go find him . Go ! _ _ What are they doing ? No . Oh , my God . Cheng knows we 're here . Jack , I have to tell Kate . She needs to move now . Kate , it 's Chloe . They 're onto us . You have to get Audrey out of there - and get the CIA involved . - I 'm about to move into position , Chloe . Cheng 's gonna order the sniper to shoot ! Get Audrey out of there now . Move . _ Engage ! Engage ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Okay , got him . Get up there and make sure he 's dead . Audrey , are you okay ? Yes . Eric , it 's Kate . Where are you ? I 'm at Malden Park with Audrey Boudreau . Inform Secret Service that we have secured her and we 're taking her back to the CIA . - Where 's her current detail ? - I 'll explain everything later . Right now you need to get a team over to South Hampton docks . Jack was going in stealth but right now he 's in trouble and he really needs your help ... he 's trying - to stop this war . - Kate ... I need tac teams suited up in choppers , now ! Jack , Audrey 's safe . Thank God . They 've jacked my feed . I 've lost satellite , and I 'm trying to get it ba ... Chloe ? Chloe ? Jack ? Jack ! Jack , do you copy ? I 've cut communications and taken over their satellite feed . These two ... signatures ... must be Bauer and whoever he has with him . We 're leaving now . _ _ They 're getting ready to push off . I need you to get down to the engine room , do whatever you can to stop , and I 'll make my way to the bridge . Go . Is Jack closing in on Cheng ? Yes . Cheng was using you to get to Jack . That 's why Jack sent me here . Is Jack all right ? I don 't know . Get down ! Got two men down . Oh , God . Audrey . No . Call Erik , tell him we have a second shooter . Give me that . Get medical here right now ! Oh , my God . Stay with us . Erik , we need medical now ! Audrey Boudreau 's been hit . Cheng had a second shooter . Stay with me . Stay with me , Audrey . Come on . Stay with me . Oh , God . Okay . Stay with me . Stay with me . Stay with me . Audrey , will you stay with ... ? Oh , God . Please , Audrey . You 're not gonna ... Audrey , please stay with me . Stay with me , okay ? Stay with me ! Oh , God . Admiral ? Air reconnaissance confirms . The Chinese amphibious groups are still on course for our base in Okinawa . Mr. President , I need a go-ahead to engage if the perimeter is breached . - Anything from Jack ? - I 'm afraid not , Mr. President . Sir , our forces are awaiting your orders . I know that , Colonel . Sir ... I need a word . Private . Belcheck ? I got to fall back to reset . Copy that . Chloe . Jack , it 's Kate . Yeah , go ahead . Jack , I 'm so sorry . We lost Audrey . What are you talking about ? You said she was safe . I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . There was another shooter , and he got her , Jack . I 'm ... I 'm so sorry . Jack ? Jack , can you hear me ? Jack , talk to me . Engine ... turn it off . You should have stayed hidden like a rat . You could have died an old man . The Chinese have breached the perimeter , Mr. President . Permission to engage . Set weapon postures red and tight . You are cleared to engage any positively-identified Chinese air or surface targets . Mr. President , if this should escalate , we need to begin reviewing the nuclear response scenario . Begin the review . Sir , I 'm putting through an urgent call from downstairs . Excuse me , gentlemen . I have Jack Bauer on live comm link . Hold that order . Delay weapon posture red . Putting it up on the monitors . This is Jack Bauer . I have Cheng Zhi , and he is alive . I have Cheng , and he is alive . Initiate facial recognition . Copy that . Just connected with the Chinese . Just give me one second . You 're being recorded . Tell them who you are . Tell them who you are . Do we have confirmation ? Just a few more seconds , sir . Tell them who you are ! My name is Cheng Zhi ! Did you get that ? Got it . That 's facial recognition and voice match . It 's him . Copy that . Out . Let 's get President Wei on the line . This is for Audrey , you son of a bitch . Mr. President , did you receive the file we just sent you ? I 'm looking at it now . Then you can see that Cheng is alive and in our custody . This confirms everything I 've told you about the sinking of the Shenyang . It was not my order . We will need to verify this recording . Well , you can verify it all you want , but in the meantime , you need to turn your ships around . Your ships have crossed our defensive perimeter . If you don 't turn them around , I 'm going to be forced to respond . All right . I will instruct our ships to withdraw , but I need your assurance that we will discuss reparations for the loss of our carrier and the soldiers aboard . You have that . And thank you , Mr. President . Sir , I , uh ... Before we head back out , I ... need to talk to you . Speak . It 's rather sensitive , sir . Maybe , uh ... Maybe you want to sit back down . I don 't need to sit down . What happened ? Tell me . Sir , um ... It 's Audrey . She 's dead . She was shot by a sniper during her meeting with Jiao Sim . It was one of Cheng 's men . That 's got to be a mistake . She was at a covert meeting . She had Secret Service detail with her . That 's impossible ! Every man on that detail was killed , as well . I 'm so sorry . It 's not a mistake . We got confirmation from the field that your daughter died ten minutes ago from a gunshot wound . Oh . Sir . Sir . Get a medic in here , will you ? We need a medic at the second floor conference room . You okay ? Sir , you okay ? Okay . Go easy , go easy , go easy , go easy . Easy . It 's okay . - Chloe ? - I haven 't heard from her . Not since we charged the boat . Chloe ? Jack . Oh , no . No . Chloe ! This is Bauer . Who is this ? When ? Where ? Understood . I 'll be there . Just set it up . Erik . It 's my after action report . Look ... what happened to Audrey , it wasn 't your fault . Field work is not an exact science . There 's no way you could have known that Cheng had a second shooter . Yeah , I , uh ... I realize that . Per the president 's orders , these men are going to escort you to Lakenheath where a military transport will take you back to the States . How is the president ? The president is boarding Air Force One as we speak . James , you have my deepest sympathy . I can 't even imagine what you 're going through . Thank you , Alastair . You 've been a good friend . If there 's anything I can do , anything at all ... No , there 's nothing you can do . Nothing anyone can do . The day before we left for London , I was sitting in my office looking at a picture on my desk of a beautiful woman . I kept staring at it . It 's been on my desk since my first day in office . And I knew that I knew that woman . But I couldn 't think of her name . Ten seconds , 15 seconds go by , then , poof . Pops into my head . It was Audrey . I 'm so sorry . I won 't remember anything that happens today . I won 't remember anything that happens , period . I won 't remember that I had a daughter that died in such a horrible fashion . _ Are you sure you want to do this ? Yeah . She walks first ! Jack , you don 't have to do this . It 's time for you to go home . You were right about what you said , earlier . About being my best friend . Thank you . Look in on my family when you can . Go . Go . I 've taken you at your word . But if you 're lying to me ... if anything happens to her or my family ... your entire world will come apart , and you will never see it coming . We just want you , Mr. Bauer . That 's all we ever wanted . I would say you 're going to enjoy Moscow ... but you 'd know I was lying . Go to the car . Go .

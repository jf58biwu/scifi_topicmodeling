 How many more do you figure , Captain ? A dozen probably , maybe more . I think air supports getting a little too close to us , sir . Is the radio still working ? No , sir . This one 's full of sand . The only radio left is in the other vehicle , sir . Cover me , Corporal . Yes , sir . Ghost Rider 5 , this is Warrior 6 . Come in . Over . This is Ghost Rider 5 . Go ahead . Over . We appreciate the support , Lieutenant , but I need you to back off that truck . Otherwise General Thoren is gonna rip us both a new one . Roger that , sir . ( Screeching ) Schwalb ! C 'mon , buddy . Schwalb ? Medic ! Medic ! Anything I can do , sir ? ( Screeching ) ( men shouting ) ( wind whistling ) ( helicopter blades whirring ) Ghost Rider 5 , this is Warrior 6 . Come in . Over . Go ahead , Warrior 6 . The enemy has stopped firing . We 're gonna move in and check it out . I just need you to stay close . Copy ? I 've got your back , sir . Over . All right , Collins , tell the men we 're gonna move out . We 're gonna head over there and see what the hell happened . - Rock ' n ' roll , sir . - All right , Collins , tell the guys not to get cocky . I don 't want any more casualties . - Copy ? - Copy that . Anything , sir ? No , it 's like they packed up their tents and moved out . What about all that screaming ? You got me , Private . Do you think it 's a trap , sir ? I don 't know . Let 's move in and check it out . Stay low . ( Helicopter blades whirring ) Inventory sheets indicate two crates missing , sir . They 're over by the rocks . Have the guys collect the weapons . - I 'll be there in a minute . - Copy that , sir . - How bad is it ? - A clean exit . You 'll live . But it looks like you just bought yourself a trip back home . Wonderful . What do you think happened there , Captain ? I have no idea . They leave the weapons truck out in plain view . One minute they ambush us , the next- - Any idea why they left ? I have no clue . I 'm just happy they 're gone . Thanks for the Band-Aid . My pleasure . If you don 't mind , I 'm going to take a closer look . Be my guest . Beshbesh- - a very large , very dangerous spider . A spider did this ? I 've seen plenty of spiders out here , but none of them could do that . Then you have never seen a beshbesh . They 're extremely deadly and can reproduce in a matter of days . My people call them " devils of the sand . " Well , whatever you call ' em , they were angels for us today . Just get that Humvee as close as you can , okay ? Yes , sir . How 's it coming , Collins ? Good . Only two rebels unaccounted for , sir . Well , they might be up above these rocks . Why don 't you sweep the area ? Take Daniels with you . ( Spider screeches ) What the hell was that ? It could be a sand devil . What the hell is a sand devil , sir ? Unless you want to find out the hard way , forget sweeping the rocks . Let 's just get these rifles in the truck . All right , gentlemen , pack it in . Pack it up . We 're moving out . Men : Yes , sir . Man : You heard the captain . Move it out . - Captain . - What is it ? It 's Corporal Schwalb , sir . He didn 't make it . Damn it . Send it up , sir ? No , pack up his gear . Box him up . I 'll take him home with me . Yes , sir . You got something to say , Sergeant ? No , sir . All right , just tell me what 's on your mind. it 's an order . Permission to speak freely , sir . Granted . Now spill it . It 's just that we 've been driving since 0700 and that 's only the third time you 've spoken to me . You 've been keeping track ? It helps me to stay awake , sir . It 's either that or my smokes , and I quit those a month ago . A smart decision , Sergeant . Those things will kill you . But I imagine it 's better than a bullet to the head . Were you and Corporal Schwalb close ? Close enough that this isn 't just a responsibility . It 's a duty . I 'm sorry for your loss , sir . Thanks. it 's not the first time and I 'm sure it won 't be the last . Schwalb was a good soldier . They 're all good soldiers . I appreciate you letting me piggyback on your ride here . It 's not a big deal . Not much back there but some M-16s for the new recruits coming in from Selby next week . - Fresh meat . - Yeah , yeah , yeah . ( Siren wailing ) Yeah , Jimmy Ray , I got an eye on him . Jimmy Ray : Roger that , Sheriff . Can you pinpoint the location ? They 're headed east on 131 , gotta be doing 90 mph . Jimmy Ray : Copy that . Go ahead and call up Mac over at Cedarsburg and see if he can 't set up a spike strip or something for us . I imagine we both could use a little bit of coffee about now . How far did you say that rest stop was ? Just around the bend . - Watch out ! - ( tires screech ) Oh , that ain 't good . ( Screeching ) ( sighs ) - Jimmy Ray . - Go . We 've got a little accident out here on 131 just past the marker number 12 . We 're gonna need some emergency vehicles . Jimmy Ray : Copy that , Sheriff . Just call Abe out at the garage and have him send out a tow truck , okay ? And like I said , gonna need a meat wagon . Jimmy Ray : Coming to you . ( Air hissing ) Are you okay ? Yeah , I think so . We 're gonna have to put you in for the Purple Heart . Thanks . Y 'all all right ? Yeah , I think so . I 've got a medic coming . Hell , it looks like you lost some of your load . I hope it wasn 't top secret . I gotta help this one . Sheriff , Captain Mike Sturges . I 'm gonna have to ask you to lock down the road till I can pack up and get out of here . I 'm sorry , Captain . Nobody 's getting out of here anytime soon . Why 's that ? Sheriff : Well , I 'm no mechanic , but she looks like she could use a little work before she 's ready to roll . I could offer you a ride back to Cedar Creek if you want a hotel for tonight or something . I appreciate it , Sheriff , but we have to stay with the truck . Well , all right , then . Go ahead and see if she 'll operate . If she works , I 'll escort you myself . - All right , thanks . - Thank you , Sheriff . Sturges : All right , Sergeant , see if you can start her up . Yes , sir . ( Electronic dance music playing ) - This is it . What did I say ? - It 's gorgeous . - Beautiful , bro. it 's awesome . - Whoo ! Let 's party . Yo , Erin , get the stuff in the back , all right , babe ? - Nice move , man . - Whatever . ( Screeches ) Hey , you got the bottle ? Oh , yeah . Good call . Hey , sharing is caring . Come on . There you go . There you go . Hey , I thought we came out here to go hiking , not drinking . Yell at him , not me . Come on , Erin , stop being such a stiff . You know what ? I know where this is going . I 'm out of here . Hey , what 's up ? Where are you going ? Back to the car so you can take me home . But we just got here . Then I 'll drive myself . - Where did you get those ? - Oh , don 't you remember ? " Don 't forget to lock up when you get the stuff out of the back , babe . " How am I supposed to get home ? Try hitching a ride with your drinking buddy . Are you serious right now ? Bitch . You always leave the sunroof open . What if it rains , you dope ? ( Engine starts ) ( screeches ) ( Trent screaming ) He 's just making a scene for Erin . Ignore him , baby . See ? - ( Rocks clattering ) - Did you hear that ? It 's just rocks falling . Rocks fall all the time around here . No , it 's Trent . He 's watching us . Ignore him . Trent , knock it off . Just ' cause you 're not getting any doesn 't mean you have to ruin our good time . Trent , this is so not cool . I can 't do this . You gotta go stop him . Thanks a lot , jerk . - ( Spiders screeching ) - ( screaming ) ( screaming ) Get out of here ! ( Screaming ) That 's about the size of it , sir . Major Kearns : All right , all right , I 'll get a team from the motor pool out to you by 0600 tomorrow . - Thank you , sir . - Just keep an eye on that cargo . The last thing we need is some local yokels getting one of those weapons . Yes , sir . Well , he 's bringing a new crew out here at sunup . Orders are to stay with the truck . Wonderful . So I guess I 'm camping out tonight ? Yeah , I 'll see if I can get us a couple of rooms , split duty with you . No use you having all the fun all by yourself . Fun . Do you think they got any room service ? I doubt it . I 'll check with the sheriff , see if I can get us some chow . Oh , man , I 'm starving . I could go for a burger and a milkshake , please . I 'll see what I can do . Appreciate it . Hey , I just talked to Jed . He says y 'all can park here if you want . He 's even got a couple of rooms for you free of charge if you need ' em . Thanks , Sheriff . You know where we might be able to get some chow ? Oh , heck , yeah . Come on . ( Pop music playing on stereo ) - ( music stops ) - ( door alarm beeps ) Freddy . Freddy , I need a fill-up . Freddy . Anybody ? Freddy . Hello . Help . Help us . ( Erin moaning ) Help . Help us . ( Screaming ) Now stay together , everybody . This isn 't a nature hike . We 've got specimens to examine . Yeah , but what you have to remember is that all bugs aren 't created equal . Which of course presupposes my original thesis . Will you two give it a rest , please ? You sound like two old ladies trapped in the bodies of 20-year-old mega nerds . And by mega nerds you mean future Nobel Prize winners ? - Oh ! - No . Everyone , gather round . Now this is what we came to see . Monotypic therasaphid , genus Iatrodectus , obviously at least 4,000 years old . Now as you can see from the fossilized impressions on the rock , this bug had quite an appetite . This is something you don 't see often , because most of the fauna from this region cannot thrive in the post-arctic conditions . Can we get extra extra credit if we classify the fossil by genus and species ? Certainly . Be my guest . Remarkable . Students , look at that . Oh , my God , what is that ? - Looks like a spider . - Count the appendages , Mr. Wilson . - It only has six . - Professor : This is astonishing , and especially this far removed from its natural habitat . Professor , be careful . - ( Screaming ) - ( screeching ) Oh , my God . - We 've got to help him . - No , we 've got to help ourselves . Come on . ( Screaming ) Where 's the rest of them ? I don 't care . We just have to get away from that thing . ( Screeching ) ( screaming ) Eddie ! Eddie . No ! So what are you doing stuck out here in the middle of nowhere ? Well , if they keep electing me sheriff , I 'll keep showing up for work , except I don 't expect it to last much longer . That 's too bad . Seems like a nice place . Well , it used to be . It 's practically a ghost town now . Thank God for Reba and that dang pie of hers , boy . I suppose that 's where we 're headed now , I take it ? That 's it right there . Romeo and Juliet on the rocks , over easy . - Coming right up . - All right . Hey , woman . Howdy , Ken . Hey . - And who 's this fine gentleman ? - Captain Mike Sturges . Airborne . Nice . Hey , Joe , get out here . We 've got a VIP in the dining room . All right , be right there . - Right this way , gentlemen . - VIP . ( laughs ) Bart , will you get your ass up ? How many times have I told you booths are for two or more customers ? Gentlemen . It 's good to be sheriff . We 've got some great specials today . Would you like to start with a drink ? Captain Sturges , this is my husband Joe . It 's a real honor to have you here , Captain . Thank you for your service to our country . - Pleasure . - Can I start you off with an ice tea , coffee ? Hi . Can I get you boys something to drink ? I guess Patty will take it from here . Hi , Sheriff , Officer . Ma 'am . Can I get you started with something ? Brad : I think I 'll just get a burger . I 'm not even hungry any more . Do you want anything , sweetheart ? - A grilled cheese , I guess . - You want fries with that , sweetie ? How about a fruit salad instead ? Whatever . Can I have a dollar to go play a video game ? Yeah , yeah . Here , take $ 5 . Thanks . I am so sick of you . It 's too bad you lost your appetite . I hear the huckleberry pie is out of this world . Do you even care that you 've ruined everything ? Of course I care . But I 've already apologized to you more times than I can count and we 're still headed for Splitsville in Vegas , so I don 't know what more you want me to do . Dropping dead would be a good start . So here 's where the new freeway will go . And then we 'll build the Indian casino right over the old gypsum plant . But first we 've got to get rid of these parcels , including this dump . The sooner , the better . Look , I don 't want to show up at the next shareholders ' meeting with more bad news . Just relax . It 'll all be taken care of by the end of the week . Reba : Romeo and Juliet ! All right . Makes me sick how these rednecks fall over anything in uniform . What 'd you expect ? They 're stupid . Stupid people are easily led . Let 's finish up and get the hell out of here . These hillbillies are starting to make me depressed , not to mention GI Joe and Barbie over there . So that 's it . - Is it safe to drink ? - If I was gonna kill you , sweetie , I wouldn 't do it in my own damn restaurant . It 's bad for business . Oh , and by the way , the answer is still no . Do you think we need to increase the offer ? She 'll crack . You 'll see . ( Ashley whimpering ) Look . - Let 's go . - Come on . - I don 't think anybody 's home . - Break in , then . Traci , Carl , come on , over here . Come here . Come here . Come on . - Where 's Eddie ? - He didn 't make it . Come on . They 're coming . I got it . Come on . Come on , come on . Damn . Anybody getting service ? Nothing . What do we do now ? First let 's figure out what the hell we 're up against . Well , I got a picture of the one when we were running . That is one hell of a nasty spider . What are you doing ? This phone has an encyclopedia . I 'm searching for one hell of a nasty spider . - Damn . - What 's it say ? Guys , it looks like we 're facing what seems to be a horde of camel spiders . - What ? - Yeah . It says they 're indigenous to the deserts in the Middle East . What the hell are they doing here in Arizona ? - I don 't know . - Does it say how to kill them ? No , it just says that their bite is extremely venomous and almost always fatal . Damn , we 're all gonna die . We are not gonna die , okay ? What we 're gonna do is we 're gonna secure the doors and the windows and then we 're gonna lay low . Maybe they 'll just go away . - Yeah , and what if they don 't ? - You can 't think like that , Traci . I suggest we look around the place for some kind of weapons . - Good idea . - I agree . Stay together . Traci , you 're with me . ( Country music playing ) Hey , time for another trash run . - I got it . I got it . - Thanks , Tommy . Don 't take all day . ( Distant dog barking ) ( spider screeching ) ( screeches ) ( screaming ) What was that ? Look . - ( Gunshot ) - ( screaming ) Let 's get out of here . ( All screaming ) Close that door now . - ( Beeping ) - Where 's my food ? Sergeant , I need that truck at the diner right away , - a quarter mile up on the right . - What 's going on ? You got two words : big spiders . Don 't worry . Help 's on the way . - What happened ? - Tommy 's dead . Go . - What ? - Go , go , go . - ( Screeching ) - ( screams ) Sturges : Everybody just stay calm . How are we supposed to do that ? Those things are everywhere . Shut up , stupid . Did you hear what the man just said ? All right , listen up . I 'm gonna have a truck here in about three minutes . We 're gonna hop on it and get the heck out of here , all right ? Mom , where are we going ? You just stay with me and your father , okay ? We 're gonna be all right . The captain and the sheriff are gonna take care of everything . Right ? Right . Sturges : All right , the truck should be here in a minute . I want you all to grab your belongings and be ready to go . Mom , look . - ( All screaming ) - ( gunfire ) ( horn honks ) Out , out , out , out . Move , move . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , let 's go . Let 's go , come on . Come Oh , Come Oh , Come Oh . Sturges : Let 's go . Let 's go . Come on , get in . Come on , get in the truck . - Honey , honey , come on . - UP. up . LIP - ( screaming ) Brent ! - We gotta help him . - Get in the truck , damn it . Get out of here . Go . Go . - Go , go , go , go . - Yes , sir . Come on , go ! Ashley , what about this ? Sure. it 's got a one-time use , but okay . You know , I can 't get that picture of Eddie out of my mind . It was horrible . And I just keep on thinking the same thing 's gonna happen to us . We 're gonna be just fine , Traci , okay ? Let 's just focus on staying alive until help arrives . No one even knows that we 're here . When we don 't go back to the school tonight , they 'll send someone to find us . Are you sure ? Very sure . Don 't worry , I 've got some ideas . Crap . This gives me a warm , fuzzy feeling . - The basement . - Well , let 's go down it . It 's dark . So ? We found some light . Let 's use it . How about we don 't say we did ? Come on . What if that 's how they can get in ? I hate to tell you , but if these things are already in the house , we 're dead meat anyway . All right , look , you stay here . I 'll be right back . But that 's not a good idea . Just wait right here , okay ? I 'll be right back . Carl : Buddy , are you okay ? So far so good . ( Screams ) Don 't do that . Sorry . I felt bad about you coming down here by yourself . Well , maybe next time like a " Hello , hey , I 'm here " - - something like that might be nice . Fine . Did you find any access ? No , I haven 't seen anything . - Let 's get the hell out of here . - All right . ( Spider screeches ) ( metallic rattling ) ( metallic rattling ) God , I hope this old truck holds together . Do you think these things are still following us ? I imagine so , ma 'am . Well , what the hell are they ? Some military experiment gone wrong ? You guys are something else , you know that ? - My friend 's dead thanks to you . - All right , you need to back off , son . These things are a freak of nature . I saw something like it in Afghanistan . - So you brought them back with you ? - I don 't know how they got here , but we 're all in the same boat now . And if we don 't deal with these things fast , it 's gonna get real ugly around here . Hell , we must be going up Wilson 's grade , the way this thing 's rattling . I don 't think she 's gonna make it . Any mechanics on board ? We might be able to make it to the gypsum plant . It 's about half a mile from here . We could wait it out there . That 's not a good idea . Well , you got a better one ? - Got four walls and a roof ? - The place is like a bunker . I mean it 's ugly as hell , but- - All right , then we 're going to the gypsum plant . All right , well , you 're gonna have to make a right along this road . Just look for the sign . Sergeant , there 's a sign up ahead . We 're gonna make a right-hand turn- - gypsum plant . Got it , sir . Do you think we 'll be safe there ? Anything 's better than this truck . This is Captain Sturges . Put me through to Major Kearns . - This is Kearns . - Major , yes , sir , we 're headed north . Unfortunately we 're dealing with some very large spiders . - Spiders ? - Yes , sir , I said spiders . - ( Phone beeping ) - Hello ? - Damn it . - Do you think he got that last part ? So much for Vegas , huh ? So how do you feel about an armed populace , Captain ? You know how to handle an M-16 ? ( Chuckles ) Hell , I learned how to fire one of them before I knew how to drive . How about you , Joe ? Well , I 'm insulted that you even asked . Now what , Captain ? The gates are chained . We don 't have any time to fiddle with the lock . Drive on through it . You will do no such thing . This is private property . Give him the keys . Be my guest . Go ahead , Sergeant . Ram through it . With pleasure . Everybody out . Let 's go . I 'll keep an eye on the perimeter . Honey , come on . Sharon . Come on . - Are they getting closer ? - Just keep moving . We can stay in the offices up on the second floor . There 's some water , some vending machines and a few sofas . All right , I 'll hit the breakers . - Hey , take this , will you ? - No , thanks , tough guy . - You 're gonna need it . - If he doesn 't want it , I 'll take it . - Brad : Go , go , go , go , go . - Help me get the weapons out , will you ? - Brad : Go , go . - Sharon : Hurry up . - Who has the damn key ? - Open it , damn it . - I got it . I got it . - ( all shouting ) Go , go , go , go , go . - Cain : I 'll get the lights . - Sheriff : Come on , hurry up . Come on , come on . - Joe : Let 's go , come on . - Make sure you lock that tight . Joe : Hurry up . - Sheriff : Let 's go . - ( all shouting ) Cain : Yeah ! ( All shouting ) Sharon : Come with me , honey . Come here . Come here . This way , everybody . Come on . All right , everybody , this is it . - No reception in here . - No cell signals , only landlines , and they were disconnected last month . Ma , I gotta go . Restrooms are down the hall to the left , if anyone needs them . Come on , sweetie , I 'll go with you . You know , it 's too bad we don 't have Internet service up here . It sure would be nice to see what we 're up against . Well , best I can tell , we brought them back with us from overseas . As I said , military screw-up all the way . Pipe down , slick . I have a question : How do we get rid of ' em ? Kill the queen , right ? Spiders don 't have queens . It 's not gonna be that easy . Well , good thing we brought these . ( Police radio chatter ) Jenny , it 's Jimmy Ray . I 'm at the general store . Are you sure about that report ? Jenny : Well , two people did call in to report about screams . Okay , I 'll check it out . ( Screams ) Maybe we could build a giant spider trap . Really ? What would a giant spider trap look like ? That 's not our concern . The army made this mess . Let them clean it up . You ever seen the army clean up a mess before ? Just be careful what you wish for . - This blows . - Stop being so negative . - Patty 's right . - I am ? Yes , in the morning we will devise a plan - to get everybody out of here safely . - Reba : Well , that 's great , except that I have a busload of tourists coming in at dawn . There 's not much we can do for them now , is there ? We hope for the best . Sheriff , keep an eye on everybody . I 'm gonna get the lay of the land , check for vulnerabilities . Let 's go , Sergeant . Yes , sir . I still can 't believe this day . Hey , we 're gonna be okay . ( Spiders screeching ) Did you guys hear that ? No , but I 'm ready for it . - You checked the basement , right ? - Yeah . Yeah , it was fine . - Is it ? Seriously ? - Yeah , nothing . ( Spider screeching ) I think it 's coming from behind the grate . Ash , I wouldn 't do that if I was you . I don 't hear it any more . See ? The basement 's probably the safest room in the house . Maybe we should just make a run for it . It might be okay . Think about it , honey . It 's pitch-dark out . If those things are out there , we wouldn 't stand a chance . Oh , my God , why is this happening to us ? Hey , it 's okay . I 'm here . I should go check things out upstairs . You guys try to get some sleep , all right ? I 'll take first watch . I 'll have a bird 's-eye view from up here . - Be careful . - I will . So do you have any plans for this summer ? Nothing . We 're going to Italy . ( Chuckles ) On our honeymoon . You guys are getting married ? Congratulations . When 's the big day ? - Well ... - April Sth . But that 's already past . We just decided to do it . We 're gonna deal with whatever , when and if . Best of luck to you both . Thank you . Look at your beautiful hair . - Mom . - Yes , baby ? Are we gonna die ? No . We are not going to die . We 're gonna be just fine . Well , if we 're not gonna die , then can you and Daddy get back together ? I don 't know . Okay . Are you all set ? Yeah . Let 's go get some sleep . Okay . So tell me what 's worse- - the Taliban or these spiders ? Technically they 're not spiders . They only have six legs , so ... Okay , thanks for the clarification , Professor , but you still didn 't answer my question . I hate spiders . They bite . So do I. Do you think this place is gonna keep them out ? Who knows ? We 've still got a lot of real estate to investigate . Might be some open doors in the basement . You never know . Are we gonna go in the basement ? What , are you scared ? No . Well , maybe a little . Aren 't you ? That information is classified . Yeah , right . ( Plays a tune ) You know any Coldplay ? Is that by Hank Williams ? It 's the name of a band . Never heard of ' em . Guess you 're out of luck . ( Playing " Amazing Grace " ) You know , if those two hicks that own the diner don 't make it out of here alive , that 's one less property we have to worry about . We could clear it all up in probate . You know , sometimes I don 't know how we ended up business partners . Probably because you didn 't have the guts for the dirty work , or am I misremembering ? You 're really something , you know that ? All I know is that if we end up with a spider infestation , we can kiss that Indian casino goodbye . " Native American " is the preferred nomenclature . Reba : Bet you those two over there ain 't gonna want the diner any more , now it 's filled with spiders and everything . They don 't want the diner , babe . They just want the land . The land ? There 's nothing around for miles . Not yet . I heard people talking . They 've got something up their sleeve . Really ? All right , let 's jack up the price , take ' em for all they 've got , retire early and go to Hawaii , like you said , hmm ? Lots of fishing , drinks with little umbrellas . Joe : I knew something wasn 't right with those two the first time I met ' em , sons of bitches . All right , let 's bleed ' em dry . I guess I could get used to beach living , especially if it 's with little old you . Aww . I love you , pumpkin . Hmm . - Hi . - Hi . - How 's she doing ? - Pretty well , all things considered . And you ? How are you ? Let 's just say I wasn 't expecting this when we left the house this morning . I guess we should have pulled off and stopped at KFC when she wanted to , huh ? Yeah . Hey . Hey . Do you mind ? Be my guest . Look , I 'm sorry about your friend . Was he your roommate ? Yeah . I 'm Patty , by the way . You know how to use that thing ? This ? ( chuckles ) Not yet . But I always used to go hunting with my dad and I 'm sure I can figure it out . You just aim and like- - Whoa , hey , hey , hey . Watch where you 're pointing that thing . Sorry. it 's just a gun . Well , how come you don 't want a gun ? I 'm a pacifist . Chicks dig it . So I don 't need a picture of me holding an M-16 showing up on Facebook . I 'm sure that 's like the least of your worries right now . What do I need a gun for when I have a real-life GI Joe protecting me ? You know , if sarcasm worked better on these bugs than bullets , then you would be the first person I 'd call . ( Chuckles ) Thanks . I wonder what 's behind here . It 's locked . Yeah , I don 't think anything could get through that . Come on , let 's go upstairs and get some rest . ( Spider screeches ) Anything ? Nothing. it 's totally quiet . Okay , get some shuteye . I 'll take over . All right . - Hey , Ash . - What ? You do good under pressure , I 'll give you that . Thanks , but it 's all a bluster . I 'm just as scared as everybody else . I don 't believe that . ( gasping ) ( spiders screeching ) ( men screaming ) - Cover me , Corporal . - Yes , sir . Medic ! ( Exclaims ) Are you okay , sir ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Just a- - just a bad dream , I guess . Do you always have- - ? No , I don 't . Okay , sir . ( Exhales ) ( scratching ) Oh , great . ( Wind whistling ) Good morning , sir . Not this morning , Sergeant . Anyone seen the sheriff ? Yeah , I think he went up to the roof for a smoke . - How 's the coffee ? - It 's warm at least . I 'll be damned . ( Screeching ) Joe , Reba , grab your weapons . Sergeant , stay here , - keep everyone safe . - Yes , sir . ( Screaming ) - Reba : Ken . - Stay with me , Sheriff . Oh . There 's a truck over there . Come on , let 's get you inside . Can you stand up ? Damn it . Let 's get him inside . Come on , help me out . ( Spider screeching ) ( scratching ) What the hell was that ? Where 's Carl ? The spiders must have got in . - Carl ? Carl , honey , I 'm coming . - Traci , Traci , stay here . Stay here . - No ! - Ashley , hold her right here , okay ? - Let me go . - Stay here . Stay here . - Ashley : it 'll be okay . - Carl , are you all right ? - He is not all right . Carl ! - Will will get him , okay ? Carl ? Carl ? He 's not saying anything . Carl ! Carl . This isn 't funny , man . Carl ! ( Retching ) ( spider screeching ) They got in . ( Screeching ) - Where 's Carl ? - I 'm sorry . They got him . No . God , no . - Where are they ? - In the second bedroom . They must have come in through the skylight or something . I shut the door , but it ain 't gonna hold them for long . - We gotta get the hell out of here . - What about her ? Drag her along . I 'm gonna check the front door . - You 've got to keep it together . - No , this isn 't happening . - Come on . - Carl . ( Birds chirping ) You 've got to keep it together , Traci . Keep it together . - They 're all over the porch . - Damn . We 're all gonna die . Just let me die . Let 's make a run through the back door . - We can run for our cars . - It 's worth a shot . Come on . - Come on . - Traci , come on . Do you think it 's safe ? It 's our best bet . If we stay in here longer , we 're gonna be overrun by those things . Traci , I need you to hang in there for me , okay ? Carl wouldn 't want you to give up now , understand ? Are you guys ready ? Okay , let 's go . Come on , come on . Come on . Sarge . Hey , Sarge . - Are we at the motel yet ? - No , Sergeant , but I thought- - Why did you wake me up ? I told you not to wake me up until we get to the motel . Well , I know , Sergeant , but I thought- - ( snoring ) - Are we there yet ? - No , but there 's a diner over there . I thought we could stop for some breakfast . On , come on , Sarge . I can smell the bacon over here . No , we better keep moving . Kearns wants us there as soon as possible . Come on . How many more of those do you think there are ? It 's hard to tell , but we 're not safe here any more . Reba : Maybe we killed all those nasty things . No way . Those were just scouts . Pretty soon this place will be crawling with them . Then maybe we should , like , leave or something . If I can make it to that truck , we might be able to make it to safer ground and call for help . That 's a suicide mission . How else are we supposed to get out of here ? Jeff : Joe 's right . The truck we came in with has a blown clutch . It is not safe out there . Reba : College boy might be right for once . Is there any way to get to that truck without marching across that open field ? Well , there 's a series of corridors down in the sub-basement . They used them to move chemicals and whatnot around the plant . They should get you pretty close to the loading dock . How do we even know this truck runs ? It ran two weeks ago . I saw it myself . All right , well , I 'm willing to take that chance . Sergeant and I will go down there and bring the truck around . The rest of you guys stay put . I don 't want to attract any undue attention . Gentlemen , do you mind leading the way ? Sure , I 'll take you down . - Ready , Sergeant ? - Yes , sir . ( Sighs ) Putz . ( Wind whistling ) Here it is . Are you all right ? Yeah . Just take the stairs down . It splits off into either direction . I honestly don 't remember which way to go . All right , I got it . Any lights down there ? Just emergency lights . That 's all we have . Okay . - Good luck . - Thanks . - I 'll be upstairs . - Okay . - Are you ready , Sergeant ? - Ready as I 'm ever gonna be . - Okay . - ( door opens and closes ) Well , looks like we 're back to playing soldier again . Yeah , an old habit . I tell you , if we make it through this , your first , second and third rounds are on me and you can call me whatever you want . - I 'm gonna hold you to that . - ( metallic ding ) What ? You see something ? I guess not . Well , if anything 's down there , we 're pretty much screwed . Yep - Thank you . That 's where you were supposed to reassure me . Okay . If we get ambushed by spiders , just shoot them all and everything will be fine . Thank you . I feel so much better . ( Water trickling , wind howling ) Sturges : Oh , boy , this looks like fun . Sergeant : Can 't wait . Sturges : Ay-yi-yi . They could be coming in from anywhere . Sergeant : When was the last time anyone was even down here ? Sturges : Okay , let 's spread out . Sergeant : Yes , sir . - Keep your eyes open , eh ? - Do I have to ? Man , this is creepy . Okay . ( Metallic ding ) ( screeching ) ( gunshot ) Captain ! Think they 're okay ? Well , there 's nothing we can do about it . If they 're in trouble , we 're in trouble . I 'm going down there to see if I can help . Daddy , no , don 't . It 's gonna be fine , sweetie . This is what daddies do . ( Screeching ) I 'll come with you . - Spiders ? - And then some . Let 's go . Move out . Go . - We 're here . - Captain . We 're here . We 've got to get back upstairs . We 've got to get out of here . Yes . Oh , jeez , they 're here . All right , go , go , go , go , go . Get out of here , Sergeant , go . No , sir , we haven 't been able to locate Captain Sturges . No , no sign of the truck either . - Keep looking . - Will do . What did you find ? Nothing . There 's nobody here . What do you mean , nothing ? What about the manager ? Like I said , no guests , no manager " nothing . I don 't like this . - What did the major have to say ? - He said the last message that he received from Captain Sturges was a garbled distress call . Do you think it has anything to do with this place being deserted ? I don 't know , but I don 't think we should sit around and wait to find out . Let 's get back on the road , trying to find that truck . It couldn 't have gotten that far with a blown clutch . Come on . Get her in the back seat . I 'll get her started . - What 's the matter ? - It won 't start . - What do you mean , it won 't start ? - I don 't know . It won 't crank over . - Well , we 're gonna have to check it . - All right . ( Screaming ) Oh , my God . Oh , my God . ( Screaming ) Is anyone else starting to freak out ? 'Cause I know I 'm starting to freak out . - They 've been gone , like , forever . - All right , let 's head downstairs so we 're ready when they bring the truck around . I 'm just fine right where I am , thank you . What the hell happened down there ? The basement is covered with spiders . I think it 's time for plan B. - What 's plan B ? - I don 't know . I 'm working on it . - Well , you 'd better work fast . - How about an overland route ? - That 's too dangerous . - I didn 't ask you . Captain ? I think it 's our only option . I think we 've got to fight our way out of here . - Count me in . - Yeah , me , too . Reba , I want you to stay with us . Joe , I want you to go on the roof . If you see any spiders , you let them have it . Go to channel five . - Okay . - Anybody else ? I 'll go . I didn 't think this was your type of thing , kid . Let 's just say I 'm beginning to see the light . I 'm coming , too . Ladies , I 'll see you outside . All right , everybody listen up . I know nobody has any combat training , but we stay together . We work as a team . We 're gonna get through this okay . Anything you want to add , Sergeant ? If it gets ugly out there , just remember , cover your buddy 's ass , okay ? If you 're not sure what to do , just follow Sturges ' lead . So what are we supposed to do ? There 's guns in the other room . Use them . Doesn 't sound like much of a plan to me . - Everybody ready ? - Reba : Okay , let 's do it . - All : Yes . - Then let 's move out . - All right . - Patty : Good luck , you guys . Good luck . Hey , how does this thing work ? Oh , it 's really simple . See , this is your safety . See the off position ? You want to turn it , make sure it 's in the off position . - Okay . - You 've got your clip back here , pulls out , tap it , real tight . And you want to just aim and shoot . That 's it . Just make sure you keep your sights off me , okay ? - Okay . - All right . You 'll be fine . Major Kearns , Captain Sturges . Yes , sir . No , sir . We 're in great danger , sir . No , sir . We are- - we 're being overrun by camel spiders , sir . Yes , sir . Look , I need you to bomb this place out of existence . Can you triangulate my signal ? - ( Phone beeping ) - Major Kearns ? Major Kearns . Damn it . How does it look out there , Joe ? You 've got a clear path all the way to the truck , Captain , for now at least . Let 's hope it stays that way . I hear that . I got you covered from up here , so you just do what you gotta do . All right , I 'll take the point . You guys stay close behind me . Sergeant , bring up the rear . Don 't forget , those things are quick , - so watch our flank . - Got it . - Where 's our flank ? - To the side . Are you all right , soldier ? Yeah . Yeah . I was just thinking about how much I hate spiders . Be glad they 're not bigger , or we 'd all be screwed . All right , time to earn our paycheck . Sturges : Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . - Over there . - Over there . On your right , Captain . On your left . Look out . Keep moving . Looks like the little devils are trying some sort of pincer move . Come on . On your left . On your left . Go , go . Hurry . Move it . Go ! Go , go , go ! Come on ! Come on , hop in , hop in , hop in . Go ! Go , go , go ! Come on . - Jeff : Hurry up . - ( engine grinding ) I thought you said that thing ran . - It did . - Yeah , last week . Will they get it started ? They 're working on it , sweetie . You just wait . Daddy 's gonna save us . I wouldn 't count on it . Go ! Go ! ( Engine starts ) Go , go , go , go ! Yeah , baby . Go ! Son of a bitch . ( Jeff shouting ) Jeff : They 're everywhere . ( Shouting ) Oh , my God , here they come . Damn it , you little bastards . Go , go ! Sturges : Okay , watch our backs . Jeff : We made it . I can 't believe that we actually made it . We 're not out of the woods yet . Captain . Let 's not try that again , Sergeant . Yes , sir . Did you see ? They made it . Can we go now ? Not so fast . The captain said wait here until- - I 'm through waiting . Get out of my way . I 'm going out there and getting on that truck . Stan , are you nuts ? You said yourself- - I don 't care what I said . That 's our truck and it 's my ticket out of here . You can stay up here if you want . Ass . Is Daddy downstairs , too ? Yes , baby , but we can 't go down there yet . - When can we ? - Soon . Okay , we 'll get out there . Your husbands out there . Everything 's okay , all right ? We 'll get out there . Patty : Yeah , we 've got enough guns for everybody . Joe : Yeah , we have enough guns for everyone . You 'll have guns . - Cain , you need something ? - Yeah . What we 'll do is we 'll get the captain on the horn ; we 'll make some contact ; we 'll make a plan , okay ? It 's okay . We 'll get to your husband , okay ? Hey , wait for me . Get back inside the building . Back in the building . - ( Screeching ) - Get back . ( Screaming ) Sergeant , turn this truck around . Get ready to get out of here . Everybody watch the perimeter . Yes , sir . Dad ? Dad , are you in here ? Dad . - Joe , can you read me ? - Yeah , go ahead , Captain . We 're turning the truck around right now . I have reason to believe there 's spiders in the building . I need you to get everybody down here as quickly as possible . Copy ? You got it . Okay , Patty , I 'm gonna take point . I want you to follow up with Mrs. Mullins and Hayley . - Now , Cain , I want you to- - - Hayley . Hayley . Where 's my daughter ? She 's not in here . She went to go find her father . I 'm gonna go get her . - I 've got to go . No . - No , listen . No , you stay here . - This is my daughter . - I will take care of it . - Do you understand ? - Listen , stay here . - Please . - Stay . Ladies , let 's uh , grab some guns . Watch the windows . Take care of you to take care of her , okay ? Dad . Dad , help ! Dad , help . Joe , what the hell is taking so long ? We need to get out of here right now . Cain : it 's Cain . The little girl went missing . Sturges : What the hell are you talking about , went missing ? Where 'd she go ? She went to find her dad . Joe 's out looking for her now . Hayley , get back . Joe , can you read me ? Come back . Joe , can you read me ? Come back . - Underwood . - I 'm going with her . No , no , no , you stay here . We 'll go get her . - That 's my daughter in there . - The more reason for you to stay here . ( Screaming ) ( screeching ) Mom , Dad , help ! Joe . Hayley . Sturges : All right , I need you to get everybody out of the offices down to the back loading dock as soon as possible . You got it ? Roger . - You heard that , right ? - Yeah . - All right , let 's go . Come on . - Ready ? Come on . Hayley , duck . Don 't worry , we 're gonna get you out of here . Hayley : Oh , no , they 're not in here . Underwood : Okay , you 're gonna be fine . This is Underwood . The first floor is completely infested with spiders . I 'm held up in a tool shed somewhere towards the back end of the supply dock . But please tell the others to get out while they can and warn them to be careful . I 'm sorry , but Joe didn 't make it . I 'm fine for the moment , but I 'm gonna need some serious cover to get out of here . Oh , and I 've got Hayley . She 's okay . Again , we 're trapped inside the storage area somewhere on the first floor . Sturges : Hang in there , Sergeant . I 'm coming in to get you , don 't worry . Yes , sir . Over . Thank you . - Come on , try to keep up . - What if I fall and break my ankle ? Too bad . Patty : Oh , hurry up . ( Spiders screeching ) You can 't help him . Come on . Patty : Come on , come on . Did they go away ? I don 't think so . I don 't see anything . Yeah , but that doesn 't mean they 're gone , honey . Don 't worry , okay ? The captain 's coming to get us . You 'll be fine . ( Both scream ) Oh , my God , they 're on the roof . Stay back . There . Oh , my God . - Where ? - Over there . Let 's go . Well , ladies , what do you say we get the hell out of here , huh ? Pick the girl up . Let 's go . - Come on . - Let 's go . Let 's go . Hurry . - My gun , sir . - Just leave it . Come on . Oh , my God , here they come . Give them some cover . Come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Let 's go . ( Spiders screeching ) Sharon , come on , honey . - Have they got her ? - I think so . Oh , thank God . She 's got her . - There you go , sweetie . - Mom , Mom . - Hayley . - Come on , sweetheart . All right , we need to go . Get in the truck . Sharon : Let 's get out of here . Give me a hand . Sturges : Everybody hang on . ( Police radio chatter ) - You think they got them all ? - I think they got enough . We 'll bring in another team and mop up the mess . It looks like the state police set up a perimeter and are out gassing the brush to flush out the remaining bugs and torch the living crap out of them . Appreciate the report , Sergeant . Are you ready to complete our mission , Sergeant ? Affirmative , Captain . You know those things will kill you , right ? Are you gonna put a " sir " on that ? Thanks for the reminder , sir . You know , I believe I owe you a couple of beers , don 't I ? I believe you do , Mike .

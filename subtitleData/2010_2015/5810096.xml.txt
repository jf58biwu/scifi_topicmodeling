 - I quit ! - Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets . I 've never been more attracted to you than I am right now . I 'd like you to take over as interim director . The disease is spreading too rapidly , But if we can reboot her immune system ... - With my kid 's bone marrow ! - Now for the embryos . My father is the father . I 'm carrying your baby . You had to put your own child inside of her ? Don 't do this . Helena ? - We 're not safe here . - Where are you gonna take her ? Pleasure to meet you , felix . - What have you done ? - I know how frightening this must be for you . You may even grow to like it here , as I did . Do you have any known allergies ? Are you taking any prescription medication ? Giving her bone marrow , she 's a child ! She 's eight years old for christ 's sake ! I should have known . I should have seen it . She is eight years old , she doesn 't get a choice in any of this . What is your sexual orientation ? Do you now , or have you ever used intravenous drugs ? How many sexual partners have you had ? - Are you ovulating ? - I don 't know . - Are you ovulating ? - I don 't know ! Five bloody minutes ! I cannot go over it again and again , sarah . I thought it was you ! She looked like you ! She was ... When did you first have sexual intercourse ? Fourteen , fifteen ... - Have you ever had an std ? - No . Have you ever been diagnosed with a reproductive disorder ? - No . - Have you ever had an abortion ? Have you ever had an abortion ? - Yeah . - Have you ever been diagnosed with mental illness ? No . - Do you use birth control ? - Sometimes , yeah . Be strong , child . I don 't know whose side you 're on . And I know you always put kira first . And we 'll do that now . But first , we need to get felix checked by a doctor . Felix ? Felix , honey . You , we have to get you for the toxicology test . - No , not a chance . I 'm fine . - No , love , we can 't be sure what you 've had . We don 't ... Sarah , you 've got to ... Sarah ? - My name is sarah manning ... - Speak up , please ! My name is sarah manning . And this is my unconditional surrender . Good morning , ms . Manning . My name is dr . Nealon . - Nice to see you again . - Again ? At our first encounter , I thought you were beth childs . The bloodwork told us otherwise . You examined me in my sleep . I 'm glad that will no longer be necessary . You began menstruation very young . Look , I 'm gonna cooperate , but I wanna see my kid . Kira is fine . You have my word . Come on , honey . It won 't hurt , it 's just cotton . Mmm-mmm . Please ? There . All done . Hello ? Hey , you can 't take that ! Hey ! We just finished processing that material , martin . And your transplant is being booked . The marrow being sent directly to dr . Nealon . - What ? Who 's dr . Nealon ? - Your new physician . - What ? I have a new physician ? - Dr . Cormier didn 't tell you ? This is all on rachel 's orders . Effective immediately , you 'll no longer be working with clones . Frankfurt . - And if I refuse ? - You 'll be on the plane . You have everything you wanted . Everything dyad wanted . You used me . Please ... Let me say goodbye to cosima . Cosima will be well cared for . And sarah 's procedure is imminent . You forget , dr . Cormier , none of this is personal . I love her . And if you let her die without me , it is personal . No one is more familiar with her illness than delphine . - We need her . - Dr . Nealon has all dr . Cormier 's records . She 'll get the best possible care . She had the best care , you took it away ! This is not a debate , mr . Smith . - If you wish to remain involved ... - Uh , uh , uh , martin ? Ahem , scratches . Can you tell dr . Nealon that I am really excited to work with him . Um , is there anything that I can do for sarah ? I just don 't want anybody to get hurt . Maybe if I can 't see sarah , then I can see kira ? You know ? She 's just a little kid And it 'd be a nice gesture from you guys . You know , we can foster cooperation . I 'll see what I can do . Awesome , thank you . - What are you up to ? - I don 't know yet . Cosima , we should really leave . Yeah , I know , we probably should . But they 're planning something for sarah . Delphine just sent me rachel 's itinerary . So , we know where she 's going to be ? And we know where sarah 's going to be . In 16 days , when you begin to ovulate We would like to harvest your eggs . - You would ? - Yes . Well I would like to see my daughter . Sign consent to the procedure , and I will make that happen . Look at me . Do I really need to sign ? Does that really matter ? Bureaucracy . Take me to her . You want some tea ? Hello , sweetheart . - Are you comfortable ? - Is my mum here yet ? Soon . I hope . The last time I saw your mother , She laid hands on me . Do you know what that means ? - No . - It means she wasn 't very nice to me . And then she kept running away , Just as she ran from you so many times . Did that make you sad ? Yeah . But she says she says she 's all grown up now . I hope she is . Even mothers have to do as they 're told sometimes , Don 't they ? Absolutely not , what part of this are you not understanding ? No , you listen . Amburlord is not an option . If I saw you 're making A car bomb , you will bloody well make a car bomb . I will call you back . - Who was that ? - That was ah ... That was nobody you need to know . Hey , mrs . S ? - Who are you ? - I 'm cal . I 'm kira 's father . - Kira called me this morning . - And when did she give you this ? For christ 's sake siobhan , I can vouch for him . After eight years you finally meet kira 's dad , you don 't even tell me ? Oh , let 's do open a rollicking debate about keeping secrets , shall we ? Guys , guys . Please . Can you put the gun down ? Look , sarah never told me anything , ok ? I just ... I just kinda figured it out . Genetic identicals . Kira knows it too , even though she doesn 't really know what it means . I 'm here to help . I did a lot of digging on dyad . - He 's handy that way . - Is he ? - Arthur ? What can you tell me ? - Well , I can tell you I just came home to find someone at my table . - What do you mean ? Who ? - She 's eating . Hello sestra-brother . I want to see sarah . Holy shit . - Helena 's back . - Do not tell her about sarah . Ok . Art , have you told her anything ? - No , of course not . - I want you over there , felix . - She is too unpredictable . - Hang on just a second . - Me ? - Yes , you . Oh , god . Just keep feedin ' her art , alright ? - I 'm going to be there as soon as I can . Bye . - Yeah . Just keep her on ice , clear ? Do not let helena out of your sight . Ok . - Duncan ? - Sarah . Don 't despair , my dear . Don 't despair . I fell in love with a boy called jesse , But after bar fighting he had to go to war and become ... A tow-truck driver . Ok . Ok , look . There was a fire at the johanssen ranch last night . Do you know anything about that ? No . Helena . Did you burn down the fish people 's ranch ? No . - When do I see sarah ? - Soon . She said kira can 't wait to see you . After my heart was broken , I became roommates to a very good girl . Ok . So tell me about that . Oh , she had a crisis of faith . What 's done is done , gracie . We can start fresh . Am I a sinner for wishing my father dead ? He deserved it . God 's just gonna have to deal with the both of us then , isn 't he ? Yes . He will . Because we 're together now . That means the child inside you , too . The dyad group has these key people On dozens of corporate boards , you know ? I 'm talking super-pacs , and research groups and lobbyists . All a concerted effort to try and affect bio-genetic patent law . I can use the internet actually , cal . No , you can 't . No offense . - Well what have you discovered ? - It 's not what , it 's who . Someone from dyad tried to hack me , so I hacked ' em back . I followed this person on darknet , And I saw ' em asking the same questions as me . - Jesus , you fell for that ? - They had real information ... Project leda , clones . And they know I 'm kira 's father . I think this is an insider , and high up , too . They get to you , they get to kira . They already have kira . And yet ... - This person is still here . - They 're there now ? Can you help ? Oh , come on ... Just tell them you 're with siobhan sadler . - S-iovan ... - It 's with a " bh " . Oops . Sorry about that . Come on . Castor . Does that mean anything to you ? Don 't know your mythology , do you , cal ? Luckily , you 're not the only person with an inside man . Well . I didn 't peg you for a major back at professor duncan 's house . I wasn 't . A lot has changed since I came back in . But you 're still prepared to play double agent . Like you , I want to know the truth . I 'm impressed , paul . Well , I 'll be impressed if you can actually pull this off . Cup of tea while we wait ? Suddenly , I heard a thud and a hissing Behind me and looking ' round , sprang to my feet With a cry of horror . Against the warm dawn , Great tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure and ... Are you enjoying yourself ? - I 've brought tea . - Threads of blood red ... Just hot water for me . Brought my own bag . - Do you remember this day ? - As often as possible . It 's a day I would have never seen Had it not been for your synthetic sequences . And yet , martin tells me You 've encoded them with a non - repeating substitution cipher . Why deny existence to more of us ? We 're your life 's work . I 've given you the sequence to need to help cosima . Cure her , then we 'll talk about unlocking another . Unlock another , and we 'll talk about curing cosima . Well , since none of us seem to know what you 're actually for , I think your attempts to make new clones should meet with failure . I want the key to your cipher . I 've had twenty years to work on it . It 's rather good . Where is it ? Is it with sarah 's people ? My dear , I didn 't write it down . You know I can recite pi to 6000 places . Do you recall , rachel , not the memory , But the feeling of how much we loved you ? The reason I watch these tapes so often , Is because I don 't remember at all . What have you done ? What have you done ? Oh , my poor , poor rachel . - No ! - My poor , poor rachel . - Why ? No ! - It won 't take long . No , no , no , no , no . You can 't leave me again . You can 't leave me again ! No ! I 'm afraid you don 't deserve me anymore . Martin ! So , you know what I need , if this gets sarah out of there ? I 'm well aware . Well , this should be interesting . - Alright . They 're willing . - Paul , meet cal . - He 's kira 's father . - Hi , paul . What 's so funny ? Ah , you 're a friend of sarah 's ? Just look at you two . I don 't know how she does it . Ok , what 's happening now ? We are hoping that there are still good people In the most corrupt places . You . The monitor . Paul dierden . Yeah , I think I know who you are . Apparently we 're both willing to risk our necks To get to the bottom of this , hmm ? Castor . You guarantee that sarah and her daughter will be released and protected ? I can get them out , the rest is up to sarah . You like your new dolls , kira ? - No , not really . - No ? Um , do you want to do some science ? - Science class ? - Yeah , it 's my favorite . Pure science . You want to do it ? - Yeah . - Ok . We 're going to do an experiment . I want you to try to push Your favorite pencil through this paper . Ok ? See if you can do it . Oops ! How come that didn 't work , I wonder ? 'cause you know what ? You need more force . So , force equals mass Times Pew ! Acceleration . How can we get the pencil through this paper do you think ? We need to make it sharper ? That 's a really good idea , high five for that . What about speed , maybe ? Acceleration ? Should give that a shot ? Nice one ! You won the experiment . You won science . You 're a scientist now . You want to make , um , a picture for your mom ? Yeah . Ok . Maybe we can explain to her what we learned today . Hey ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Cosima . - I 'm ok . I 'm ok . Sorry , I 'm ok . - Cosima ... - It 's not going to work . - It has to work . - She needs us . - Cosima . Hey ! Hey ! - Let me do this . - Where 'd you get that ? We 're only gonna get one chance . What 's going on ? Let go of me ! Let go ! What are you doing ? - Why are you doing this ? - Ok , here she comes . No , move that . Move that to the other side . - Please ! - You got her ? Three , two , one . What are you gonna do ? Cosima says hey . We 're gonna help you get out of here . - What is this ? - We 're performing an oophorectomy . A what ? We 're removing one of your ovaries , for research . Bullshit you are . - That 's not what I signed . - You 'll still have one . We don 't wish to render you infertile . On the contrary . I hope you look forward To another pregnancy as much as we do . Dr. Nealon ? - Ms . Duncan . - I 'd like a second to speak to my sister , please . Two minutes . Everybody stay prepped . Ok , everybody out . Kira gave me something for you . You psycho ... She also gave her bone marrow , to cure cosima . - Duncan is dead . - What ? He took his own life . But I know he gave you the key to the synthetic sequences , didn 't he ? What key ? To his cipher . He wrote them down for you . I don 't know what you 're talking about . - Rachel , I don 't know . - No ? Enjoy your oophorectomy . We will continue this when you 're done . Rachel ! I 'll tell you . Good , where is it ? Where 's he written it ? Right here . Go . Get kira . Go ! - Ah . - Mommy ! She 's ready . I was just about to get you . You 're free to go , you don 't have to run . I 'm very impressed by you , sarah . - By both you and your mother . - Who are you ? My name is marion bowles . I 'm from topside . I 've opened the doors , but this doesn 't end with rachel ... Sarah , if you ever want to stop running , If you want the truth , if you want to know What this is really all about , then you meet me tomorrow . Cal can arrange it . He 's downstairs waiting to take you home to your sisters . Well , tonight was uh , certainly informative . - Give me five . - Later , cal . - Take care . - Yeah . Nice to meet you . He 's hot . Well , that 's us . Yeah , well , it 's a pretty standard group of sisters . Yeah , I think so . Um , I 'm going to be around , ok ? I want to help with kira and getting the marrow and stuff . I don 't think we can do that again for another six weeks . - Oh . - So , I don 't know what 's going to happen to cosima . - I 'm sorry about that . - Whatever you did To marion bowles , thank you for doing that . Don 't thank me , ok ? I 'm not doing this for thanks , I 'm doing it because I ... Oh , hello . - Steamy potatoes . - Hi . - Cal ? - Yeah ? You 're not bringing all that game into my bed , I hope . No , fortunately not . It 's uh , clones only tonight . That means me too . - See ya later . - Bye . - Bye . - Bye ! Listen , I don 't know if this is a good idea or not , Because it 's crazy , but art has someone downstairs Who really wants to meet her sisters . Helena ... - Oh , my god . - This is your sister , cosima . - Hey . - You shouldn 't be up . I 'm up . Come here . You 're very beautiful . Thank you . I like your hairs . Thanks . I like your hairs , too . Helena , this is your other sister , alison . Hello , helena . - Lovely to meet you . - Pleased to meet you , too . - You are married ? - Yes , oh yes , very much so . - Um , to donnie . - I will be married too , one day . Well , it 's very rewarding if you can get through the rough patches . Auntie helena ! We thought you ran away from us . I came back to see your little face . I 'm so happy to see you , I 'm going to eat your finger . no ! - Is she alright ? - Yeah . - Yeah ! - Oh , ho ! - Oh , yeah ! - Oh , yeah . Come on ! Go ahead . Whoa ! Whoa-ho-ho , helena ! Whoa ! whoo ! - Whoo ! - Hey , monkey ! - Whoo hoo ! - Go , kira ! ¶ keep the vibes alive ¶ Whoo ! Hey . What were you thinking about ? Um , buckminster fuller , and sacred geometry . Look , so this spiral . This is the golden ratio . And it 's a mathematical pattern that just repeats itself In nature , in flower petals and honey bees , In the stars in the galaxy And in every molecule of our dna . God , we 're so different all of us . Yeah . I know . I don 't even know how to look at art . - Don 't tell fee . - Mmm-hmm . You 're the wild type , sarah . You propagate against all odds . You know , you 're restless , you survive . I can 't do this without you , cosima . You 'll be fine . - Yeah . - You just have to keep moving forward . Forward through the looking glass With marion bloody bowles . What could go wrong ? Thank you . Auntie cosima ? Auntie cosima ? Auntie cosima ! Don 't be afraid . I will never leave you . - Hello . - Can you read me a story ? Mmm-hmm . Hello ? Hello ? Hey . Are you hiding ? Charlotte ? It 's sarah . Don 't be shy , love . Come on . Hello ... You know her . You 're my big sister . - How old are you ? - Eight . I have a daughter your age . Her name is kira . I 'm her cousin . Aunt , actually , but we 're gonna go with cousin for now . Come . " and our dog was the first dog " to make the long journey west . " So the puppy followed the explorer the whole way ? Mmm-hmm . Cool , huh ? Can we read another ? Mmm-hmm . Whatcha got ? Whoa . The island of dr . Moreau . It 's about a man who makes monsters . - I know , I love this book . - It 's special . Where did you get this book ? Professor duncan gave it to me for a present . Wow . - So you 're her monitor ? - I 'm her mother . - You carried her ? - Adopted her . Like siobhan , I 'm invested . I thought they couldn 't make more of us . Oh , we tried . Over 400 attempts . Charlotte 's the only survivor . You survived too , sarah . Against all odds You found your sisters and you fought for your own . Now I 'm counting on that fierce loyalty , because what I 'm about To share could put me at grave personal risk . You won 't find topside in any company directory . We steer the dyad group , with many other multinationals . - You 're a cabal . - Yes . Securing monopolies on a future that embraces Genetic engineering and synthetic biology . A future I passionately believe is inevitable . And if you don 't profit , someone else will . Yes . But it 's not only about profit . There are forces at work beyond topside . I had evidence of another agenda , But I couldn 't verify it without your mother 's help . Please . Sarah , the military never shut down project leda . It was compartmentalized into two autonomous operations . While dyad carried female clones to term , A military faction carried the males . This is project castor . I know him ... Sarah will never forgive me . You did what you had to . And do you , mark , promise to be faithful to gracie ? - I do . - Mark , you may kiss the bride .

 Previously on Heroes ... Whatever happens in your world , you can always come back to this one . I know . I 'll find my way . - Nice to meet you . - Mom , this is Emma . She 's gonna kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . Tell me exactly what you saw . You cannot save her . But someone else can . People think that dreaming the future is a gift . They 're wrong . I don 't want to be alone . And you 're supposed to help me . I can only imagine what having a bunch of ... excuses could do to someone 's humanity . In order to become human again , he has to get rid of all of his powers . Was that so hard ? - I 'm Gabriel , a friend of Matt 's . - He 's not here right now . Could you tell me where he is ? It 's important that I speak with him . This is your fantasy . This isn 't my life . Something wrong , sir ? Yes , something is wrong . Where is everyone ? The carnival is closed . Everybody saw what you did to that town . - They 're afraid of me . - Can you blame them ? We finally have a home here ... A place to make a life . It 's what we wanted . - What you told us that you wanted . - You don 't trust me anymore , do you ? - You haven 't for a long time . - So show me why I should . Out of trust is faith . It must be very hard for you to come by ... when you can steal a look into someone 's soul with a touch . After all I 've done for you , for all of them , I 'm the villain . And you ... you seem to have become the empath to replace Joseph . Everyone 's looking to you now for their voice , aren 't they ? What are you telling them ? Nobody respects you anymore . And I 'm gonna win it back . I love them . I need them . And I 'll do whatever I have to do ... to prove my worth . Don 't worry . I 'm here to save you . It 's Peter Petrelli . Is Emma Coolidge there ? Look , it 's important . Just ... I already went by her place . She 's not there . If you see her , call me , okay ? Thanks . Ma ? Janice , honey , you home ? Haven 't you ever heard of making two trips ? Oh , God . Are you back inside my head ? That 's so two months ago . Here , let me give you a hand . Calm down , if I wanted you dead , we wouldn 't be talking . What , then ? It 's complicated . My life 's taken a turn since last time . You could say I 'm on a fact-finding mission . Matt , honey . I thought you 'd be at work . I took Matty to day care , and my client canceled ... Lucky I was home , your friend Gabriel was in the neighborhood . He is full of stories . Stories ? From when we were partners on the force . I figured you guys would like to catch up , so I put a little late lunch together . It looks so good , thank you . Take a load off , have a nosh . We really need to catch up . This is probably not a good time . In fact , it 's not even a big deal . - It 's over . I don 't need to tell him . - You kind of do . A superpowered serial killer shape-shifted into a coed and made a pie chart of your life . It wasn 't a pie chart . It was more like a ... - Whatever . You have to tell your dad . - Really ? When Sylar killed my real dad , he didn 't tell me . I know . You 're right . But you ... I know . How long will you hold a grudge ? The whole silent treatment is getting old . We were in a good place before all this . Do you want me to come with ? I have to do this alone . I could wait . It 's probably gonna be a while . The list of things we have to talk about ... Sylar ... The cover-up of my dad 's death . Let 's not forget about the carnival . I 'm sure there 's plenty my dad wants to say about that . Good luck . You 'll feel better when it 's all over with . Or if not , at least you 'll be caffeinated . You gonna let me in ? Of course . Where 's my dad ? He just stepped out for a moment . I brought some coffee . Thought it was time to talk things over with him . I 'm sorry ... but why are you here exactly ? - Your father and I are ... - No , that 's not ... that 's not what I was talking about . You have Primatech files , and satellite maps , and this is ... everything that my dad said that he would put behind him . - I 'm just trying to help a friend . - Friends do dinners and movies . You want to help ? You tell my dad whatever it is that he 's doing , he needs to stop . I wish it was that simple . Why ? What 's going on ? There was an incident . It was Samuel Sullivan . What did he do ? They 're saying it was a landslide , but we know it was Samuel . Wait , you think he buried that town ? Can he do that ? He gains more power the more specials he has around . 200 are dead , they 're still digging out the bodies . What are you planning to do ? Your dad will be back any minute . Why don 't you just ... Actually , I have class . Looks like you have this under control , so just tell him I stopped by . - Claire , wait . - Enjoy the coffee . I 've always loved the Black and Whites . - Are they still Matty 's favorite ? - How do you know that ? Like I said , Parkman and I used to be pretty tight . We went through ... addiction counseling together , and faced our mutual demons . You know what ? I 'll show Gabe what I 've been doing in the basement . The world of Matt 's projects . You 'll love it down there . I 'm sure I will . You 're on a fact-finding mission ? What the hell does that mean ? I had to make sure I remembered it right . Husband ... and father ... You figured out a way to live with your ability . You may not believe this , but in some ways , you 're actually stronger than I am . I 'm not afraid of you , okay ? So if this is about revenge ... After what you did to me , I was tempted . I don 't want to be like that anymore . I need you to go inside my head again . You 're serious . You are insane . If I am , it 's because that 's what my powers have made me . I can 't live with them anymore . So you need to take them away . You want me to ... How am I supposed to do that ? Create a mental block , repress them . I don 't really care , to be honest . All I know ... is that once I 'm free from the temptation of my ability ... You 're gonna be normal ? I 'm sorry , that ship sailed 50 murders ago . I 'm asking nicely . The last time I was inside your head , you turned my life into a living hell . Why would I risk that ? Janice , and the kid . I really do want to change . But I 'm insane . Remember ? And all you have to do is point . Fine , I will try . But you have to let Janice go . Consider it a gesture of good faith . Hey , mom . What 's wrong ? It 's Nathan . The stonecutters called . They needed a final wording for his headstone , and I didn 't know what to say . I guess it 's the finality of it . I mean , they 're just words , but when you write them down , when you etch them in stone ... I know , mom . Maybe it was selfish of me , Peter , but I just needed to see you . I needed to be sure you were okay . Because of your vision . I had the dream too , mom . I saw all the people . And Sylar ... I think he was trying to help Emma . You saw that too ? Whatever this vision is , Peter , remember this : one isolated act does not make Sylar your friend 's savior . I need you to help me find him , mom . I know you know where he is . Sylar 's never been far from my thoughts . But I 'm begging you , don 't go . He murdered Nathan , and the last time you faced him , he almost killed you . Mom , Emma 's in trouble . People 's lives are at stake . Nathan would never turn his back on them . And you know that I can 't either . This is gonna end badly . Samuel is crazy . My dad 's gonna take him down , and there is no way this is gonna end well . What ? What do you want me to say ? What do you think I should do ? I don 't know . You 've got a humanities lecture in 20 minutes . Here 's a crazy idea , maybe you should go to class for once . Did you hear anything I just said ? I did . Yeah , all of it . But I mean , what are you really gonna do , Claire ? Your dad was right about the carnival . You never should have gone there . Look , Samuel is a bad guy , yes . But the rest of the carnival is all family and children . And they just want to live their lives being open about their abilities . I thought you said they were giving Samuel his power . But they don 't know that . You were only there for one day . How can you know for sure ? I need to borrow your car . I thought you would back me up on this . You say you want a normal life , right ? Just let your dad handle it . Come on , please . Just come to class with me . Or not . Bring it back full . - She 's not answering . - She said she had a class . Claire , call me as soon as you get this . You shouldn 't have let her go . What was I supposed to do , drag her by her hair and lock her in your closet ? What do you want to do ? We go . If Samuel 's escalating his attacks , we can 't sit around and wait to see - what he 's gonna do next . - But you 're also emotional . Look , this Samuel is a threat and not just to Claire . You go in with less than 100 % focus ... I can handle this . You don 't have to worry about me . That 's not an option anymore . Let 's go . - We need to talk . - What are you doing here ? Your father is coming for Samuel , to kill him . Claire , if Samuel finds out , he 's ... I know . That 's why I came ahead . I have seen things like this go wrong before , and I don 't want my dad or anyone else getting hurt . But we don 't much time . Samuel will never go for it . He 'll never turn himself in . We have to try . He is not listening to me , to anyone . If your father is really on his way , I should get Amanda . And what , Lydia ... run away ? Has it come to that ? I can 't say I blame you ... What I did to that town , all those people . I 'd hoped you 'd have a better reason to come back . How could you do that ? I don 't know what I was thinking . I wish I could take it all back ... And so many other things ... Joseph . Did I ever tell you the first carnival act that Joseph and I ever saw was the trapeze ? The way they flung themselves through the air , we thought they had powers , just like us . But when we went backstage , the man told us the only power he had was gravity . No matter how high he went , it was always there to catch him . I 've come to realize that gravity is different things to people . For much of my life , Joseph was mine . I 've been losing my way . And now even my own family is afraid of me . - And the only strength I have left ... - You have to take responsibility . You have to turn yourself over . To your father ? He 's not exactly known for his mercy . If you give yourself up , he will not hurt you , I promise . Please , Samuel , listen to her . If you care about this family , then protect them . There 's Samuel on the midway . Got him . Wait a second . Is that Claire ? At 2 : 00 . Dad , where are you ? Close . I heard you stopped by earlier . Thanks for the coffee . What 's the situation there ? Samuel wants to surrender . Really ? - Why ? - To protect his family . He 's willing to turn himself over as long as the rest of the carnival stays safe and under the grid . And you trust him ? If there 's a chance that we can do this without anyone getting hurt , don 't we have to try ? Dad , it 's the best plan , all right ? You get Samuel , and nobody gets hurt . All right . Tell him to meet us in the field outside of the carnival . I 'll see you soon . He 's surrendering . And you think he 's just gonna give himself up ? I don 't know , but Claire seems to think so , and I have to trust her . It 's done . He wants you to meet him in the field . Are you sure this is a good idea ? I wouldn 't worry . If it 's a setup , you 'll just get a better shot at him , out in the open . Wait a second . I 'll do down and walk him out . Keep him in the crosshairs . Be careful . I know my recent actions have caused some of you to question where it is my heart lies . I regret what I 've done . I acted impulsively , and that has brought one of them ... An agent ... To our door . It 's okay . It 's okay . They just want me . Claire has helped arrange a peaceful surrender . I 'll go with them . No , no , please , listen . I know everyone will not agree with this decision . But it 's the only way . The safety of each and every one of you and keeping this family together is what matters most to me . And if that means I have to leave , so be it . All right , Parkman , I did my part . I let Janice walk . Now it 's your turn . I know . I know . I said I would try . Nothing 's changed . I know you can do this , what 's wrong ? I don 't know . I don 't know . - I can 't . - Try again . Maybe it 's not me . Maybe it 's you . Maybe you 're fighting it . Maybe you really don 't want to let go of these powers . - You 're lying ! - I 'm not ! - What 's going on ? - Stop ! Oh , God . Please let her go . Look at me ! Come on , let her go . She had nothing to do with this . Come on , let her go . - I 'll try again . - That 's not good enough . You see what you made me do ? I don 't even know if I can do this for you . Maybe you need a little more motivation . You will purge me of these powers ... or I will use them ... I will use them all . And trust me , I can get creative . Damn . Come quickly ! Put pressure on the wound . I need your help . Come on . You wanted to know what was in my heart . You ... did ... this ? I 'm sorry . So sorry . I 'm so sorry . They needed a villain ... someone worse than me . You gave that to them . Thank you . I 'll do it . It 's too late . She 's gone . Come on , Dad . Pick up , please . Dad . I found him on the hill ... with this ! - Are you okay ? - I didn 't do it . - I didn 't shoot anything ... - Murderer ! He 's the one . You brought him here . You 're one of them . Back off ! Don 't hurt them . We 're better than this . Take him to the house of mirrors . Tie him up . And her ? My trailer . Get off ! Dad ! Let go ! He didn 't do it ! Get off ! - If you hurt her , I swear to God ... - That 's the problem , isn 't it ? One cruel thought is all it takes . These powers make it so easy . I understand that , believe me . You don 't have to use them like this . Except I do . The powers are me , now . You 've been there , dealt with them , the constant temptation . How do you compartmentalize ? How do you keep them from overwhelming your life ? You start by accepting the fact that you 're more than your abilities . We 're people first . Please , let her go . Look , I 'll try to do what you want , but let me make sure she 's okay . Last chance . Come on . It 's okay . - That 's Sylar , isn 't it ? - I 'm so sorry . This is crazy . He wants me to take away his powers and make him normal . I looked inside his head long enough , he 's serious , - but I can 't give him what he wants . - Forget about that . I work with monsters like this . He 's broken inside . We have to bury him so that he cannot hurt anyone else . Just go , don 't come back until I call you . Get on with it . You were right ... I was holding back . It 's all about motivation , right ? What if I told you that I can be special , but to do it , I 'd have to hurt a lot of people ? Should I ? You ? You could never hurt anyone . Mommy . I don 't ... I don 't feel any different . Try something , go ahead , on me . Come on . You did it . My powers are gone . They 're just buried ... somewhere that you can never get to them . You 've threatened my family for the last time . - What did you do ? - I know exactly what scares you . And it 's being alone with your immortality . - What did you do to me ? - I have trapped you inside your mind . You 're gonna be alone , Sylar . Very much alone ... In this nightmare that will last forever . And the best part about it , when I leave , you won 't remember what I did . And you 'll live every empty day like it 's real . You said you would help me . Yeah , I guess there 's still a little of you left inside me ... Because I lied . Enjoy hell . Samuel said you 'd come . Thank God you 're here . I need your help . Finally , there 's a doctor in the house . - What happened ? - We were attacked . You were attacked ? By who ? People who don 't understand us , Emma ... People who fear us . It doesn 't matter . What matters is that you 're here . You 're not just gonna heal me . You 're gonna help us make a new world for ourselves . We 'll show them , Emma . We 'll show them how great we can be . Hey , man . Sorry , I was working downstairs . - That 's okay , man . Been a long time . - Yeah , how are you ? What ? - Sylar is here . - What are you talking about ? About what you 're thinking . You 're gonna take him . You can 't do that ! People die , Matt . Sylar has to save them . Peter , he 's a murderer ! Come on , stop . Listen . He 's trapped , Peter . - What the hell did you do ? - I went inside his head , and I trapped him in his worst nightmare . He 'll never hurt anyone again . - I have to bring him back . - No , you can 't do that . You go into his head , you might not come out . Noah Bennet told me to call if anything went wrong . I went to Bennet . I thought ... Look what they 've done ... These so-called normal people . How could you let this happen ? What I did was wrong . I know that . But I was willing to sacrifice myself to protect you ... To save this family that we 've all come to love . The outside world has proven once again that people like us will never be accepted . We 've all seen it ... In the eyes of those who come to see our shows ... Dazzled by our abilities ... But filled with revulsion of who we are . I saw it again yesterday ... In that small town over the hill ... And today in the bullets that struck me and murdered our dear Lydia . It 's time . It 's time we put fear behind us . It 's time we showed the world ... what we truly are .

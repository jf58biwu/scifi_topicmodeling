 Who likes good news ? Everyone ? Then , good news , everyone . Our next delivery isn 't to some dangerous outer space planet . It 's to Earth . Earth is dangerous . I fell off my chair there once . Ow ! Quit it , Earth . We won 't even have to leave New New York . The package is going to Long Long Island . Yes , to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot . The Donbot ? The vicious Robot Gangster ? I 'd better use my special robot vision to see what 's inside . It looks like a pair of clamps . When are those new clamps going to get here ? These are all rusted out with snitch juice . Patience , Clamps , it is my eldest daughter 's wedding day . You don 't want the Space Pope to see you clamping , now , do you ? Geez , I forgot my Pope manners . Dearly beloved , it is with the great speed that I now pronounce you husband and wife . Hey ! What the ... May I help you with some assistance ? Delivery for Francis X. Clampazzo ? We don 't got nobody here by that alias . Hey , hey , that 's me . Are those my new clamps ? Your name 's Francis ? Oh ! Guys , look , it 's Calculon and the Robot Devil and an open bar . What 's not to sneak into ? Bender , you can 't crash a mob wedding . You forget , Leela . I 'm Bender , owner of disguise . And now , ladies and gentlemen , my good friend , Calculon . Hey , this one 's for the new couple . It 's your day . It 's all about you . Who 's that singing at your wedding ? It 's Calculon , Calculon , Calculon Hey . Oh . Piscopo . This guy . Bada-boing . Hey , sexy , I 'm Bender . What brings you to this tacky soirÃ © e ? I 'm the bride . Oops . How about you , baby , want to do it ? Bender , it 's me , Fanny . You who ? The Donbot 's wife ? We had an affair . An affair , huh ? Sounds like me . Geez , I 'd better be a little more careful . I don 't want to hit on anybody I already had sex with . Hiya , Bella . Hi , Mom . What about you ? You 're my third choice . Oh , Bender , this is all happening too slowly . Let 's get married . Quiet , I 'm making out with a floozy . Hold your clapper . Someone 's coming . Donbot , please , I 'll pay you back as soon as you lend me some more money . Sorry , Calculon . It gives me no joy to do this , because Clamps will be doing it . Clamps , here are your new clamps . Clamps ! No , no . Line ? No ! Yeah , Daddy hates weichers . The only thing he hates worse is witnesses . And guys who mess around with his daughters . And attempt to duplicate his meatball recipe . How was the wedding , Bender ? Says who ? I didn 't witness anything ! In entertainment news , two-time Oscar pool winner , Calculon , was brutally clamped yesterday by an unknown assailant . Poor Calculon . All right , Amy , you win ! The mob did it . I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot 's daughter . I 'm scared and great at sex . Bender , you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said . What , and have the Mafia come after me , too ? No way . This secret goes to my grave . The Bureau is offering anyone with information about this gangland-style clamping a $ 50 reward . Ooh ! Ooh ! And then Calculon said , " No , no . No ! " And then I ate some excellent meatballs . Can I have my 50 bucks now ? I enjoyed your story , especially the tasteful love scene , but it 's not enough to convict the Donbot . You 'll have to testify in open court . No , no . Can I have another $ 50 ? No . No ? No ! All rise for the Honorable Judge 723 . Be seated . Organized crime is a plague on our society , and I will not tolerate any form of intimidation during ... All rise for the Honorable Judge 724 . Good day . I 'd like to say I 'm prepared to tolerate several , if not all forms of intimidation during this trial . Prosecutor ? Your Honor , the prosecution pecks for a mistrial on the grounds of jury tampering . Donbot ? Motion denied . Prosecutor , call your first witness . The People call our star witness , Mr. X , whose appearance will be altered because he 's in grave danger . Bender , I 've been looking for you . Which cake do you like better for our wedding ? Bender ? Fix it , fix it , fix it , fix it ! That was close . Isn 't it true , Mr. X , that you are slandering this innocent Mafioso to distract from your own felonious past , including a crime you made up yourself called " burgle-arson-arceny " ? That 's a wholly owned trademark of Rodriguez Crime Concepts , Inc . Besides , I 'm not on trial here . That 's true . You 're on trial in Courtroom Three . You are charged with two counts of burgle-arson-arceny . How do you plead ? Not inno-guilty-cent . And then the Donbot said , " Sorry , Calculon , " and then Calculon said , " No ! " I think we 've heard enough . Wait , I 'm not finished . " O ! " Now I 'm finished . Your Honor , the prosecution roosts . Have you reached a verdict ? Indeed . After a steamy 12-way deliberation , we find the accused guilty as ... Wait . The Donbot is innocent . Calculon , who is that escorting you ? Yes , who ? My personal trainer , and he 's trained me to say that my wounds were self-inflicted , for , you see , I am a big , Hollywood idiot , dumb guy what does that sort of thing . Perfect . We find the Donbot ... Dramatic pause . Not guilty . What ? Honey , if you 're marrying Bender , you might want to get a black dress for the wedding . That 's going to look hot . Don 't be scared , Bender . We 're putting you in the Witness Relocation Program . You 'll be given a new identity , a new place to live , and this iPod . I don 't want it anymore . So I gotta hide forever ? No , just until the Robot Mafia finds and kills you . They 're pretty good at that . Goodbye , Professor . Before I leave , I just want you to know I 've never done any work whatsoever . Zoidberg , I know it seems like I can 't stand you . Leela , you 'll have to watch out for Fry now . Oh , Lord . I wish I could go with you , pal . Me , too . I 'll need a butler . Bender , we have to go . There 'll never be another like him . Let 's hire someone better . Clamps . Clamps ! Uh-huh ? Listen to my boss words . I would like you to apply for Bender 's old job and cozy up to this Fry , his best friend . Yeah , and then I 'll introduce him to my best friend , clamp number one ! Sorry , toots . No , Clamps . No clamps . Sooner or later , Bender will contact Fry as relocated-squealers always do . Then with the clamps , Francis . Francis ... Francis ? I 'll clamp you with the Francis ! Hey , take it ease . Hey there , slick , I 'm here about the job . Take a seat . We 'll begin the interviews shortly . We 'll start with Andrew . Yeah , they all kind of broke . So , when do I start ? Everyone , this is Francis . Hey , Francis . Hello , Francis . Hello . Cute name . Look what he can do . Wow ! Whoa ! Yeah , I do it all . Clamping , crimping , occasional snipping . Snipping ? Looks like you may be out of a job , Zoidberg . That 's all good fun , but of course a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine ... Francis , would you do the honors ? Stay off my turf ! Yeesh . That guy can bite my shiny metal clamps . You remind me of my old friend Bender . Yeah ? Where does he safely live ? I don 't know . Hey , you want to come to my house and play ? Yeah , sounds like freakin ' fun . Four stinking years of clamping school for this ? Greetings , Francis . Sorry if I was a little hostile before , but snipping is the only reason I 'm even tolerated around here . Not like you , with those magnificent squeezers . Squeezers ? Squeezers ! They 're clamps , you ! And if I want to - ing snip with these clamps , I will snip with these - ing clamps ! Why do you think they call me ... Francis ? Francis , I have good news ! It 's time for your first delivery . To the Moon ! Fan-ing-tastic ! Here 's the 200 feet of rope you ordered , Sheriff Furley . Hot diggity ! You fellers want to stick around for the hanging tomorrow ? It 's gonna be a doozy . I sure do love hanging people . Well , I best start cutting the nooses . Oh ! You know who could help with that ? Francis ! Nice job , Francis . I like how you didn 't get drunk and steal anyone 's organs , like our old robot . Bender ? Bender , it 's me , Fry ! Heeyah ! I knew Bender would turn up purely by coincidence . Take care of him , but do it quietly . Don 't worry . We 're in space , where no one can hear you clamp . What do you know ? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer . He must be afraid to break character , in case there 's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around . Heh ? Come on , let 's go check on him . I checked on a guy once . I checked him into tiny pieces ! Bender ? Nope , don 't recollect nobody by that name . But let me ask my son-in-law , Billy ? Yes , Moon-Pa ? These nice big-city hillbillies are looking for someone named Bender . You know him ? Nope . He ain 't any of the eight people I ever met . Bender , it 's us , your friends . You can drop the hillbilly moron act . Sorry , mister , but I 'm no Bender . I 'm just a simple farmer . Name 's Billy West . Billy West ? What a stupid , phony , made-up name . You city folk are probably hungry from premarital sex and flag-burning . Y 'all wanna stay for supper ? Well , my boyfriend and I were going to have sex on a burning flag , but I could have a bite . May I present my beautiful robot wife , the Crushinator . She 's serving up the dinner and the charm . Mashed chicken , Mr. Fry ? Sure . So , Billy , where were you born ? Right here in Moon country . And how long have you been a farmer ? Reckon I was born a farmer . Folks say my mama was a hoe . Oh , dear , I seem to have warped my fork . Could you bend it back for me , Billy ? Bend it ? I can 't even lift it . Which is weird , seeing as how my daddy was a forklift . Wow . Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity . If y 'all are finished , I 'll drive y 'all back to town in the old clunker . So , y 'all flew here in a spacey ship ? Stop talking like that ! You live on the Moon ! If that is Bender , I guess he 's just happier in his new life . I refuse to believe anyone is happy ! Mr. West , would you mind if I examined your brain ? Examine ? Heck , if you can find it , you can keep it . Gadzooks ! Bender 's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories ! When the Feds bumpkinized him , they completely wiped out his old identity ! Well , I don 't know about that , but who am I to argue with a man from the sky ? So long , space heroes . You sure you don 't want to kill all humans ? I love all humans . He really is gone . I guess I 'm happy for him . And honestly , Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was . Hey , where is Francis ? One sarsapar-oil-la , Sheriff . I 'm thirsty . Make it two . I 'm greedy . You got the rest fooled , but not me . Now let 's take this outside , so 's no one else gets clamped . You 're the boss , stranger . I 'm gonna clamp your body parts off one by one . But then I 'm gonna clamp your wounds shut so you stay alive while I clamp you some more ! Say your prayers , stoolie . Okay . God bless Grandma and Grandpa ... They 're next ! Right now , I 'm gonna cut your damn head off ! Drop the robot ! I thought I told you , I do the cutting around here . Scuttle on home . This ain 't none of your business , slick . My name isn 't Slick . It 's Zoidberg . John - ing Zoidberg ! Stop ! Zoidberg , you 'll hurt Francis ! Oh , yeah ? Take this and that ! Why , you lousy ... I 'm gonna clamp your ... Oh , yeah . Ow , ow , ow . Looks like an all-you-can-kill lobster fest ! That offer was for a limited time only . My clamps ! Why , Zoidberg , why ? Because our friend Francis here , is in reality a bad murderer . Yup . He was fixin ' to kill me . This here crawdad done saved my life ! Bender , you two-timing jerk ! I put off my singing career for you ! If I can 't have you , no one can ! Oh , shucks . Bender ! No ! What ? Bender was a hell of a squealer . Maybe the best there ever was . We 'll send his widow some meatballs . Clamps , Bella , get in the way-back . To my friend , Bender . A wise man once said he was a hell of a squealer . Maybe the best there ever was . To Bender ! You pizza 's gonna be another minute . We still waiting for it to be delivered . Bender ? I 'm no Bender . You got me mixed up with another robot . You 're probably right . I don 't really remember what he looks like . Guys , guys , it 's me , Bender . He 's alive ! So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father . Bender , old ' bot , the Mafia thinks you 're dead . You can come back to work with us . I 'm back , baby ! Pizza 's here . Whoo ! I 'll just cut that ... You do , and I 'll - ing gut you like a fish . English - US - PSDH

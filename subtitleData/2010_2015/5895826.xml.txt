 Organic chemistry is killing me . No matter how many hours I study , I still don 't feel like I 'm getting it . Your father knows how hard you 've been working . Yeah , I 'm sure he talks about me all the time . He just assigned you to me as a bodyguard and forgot all about me . [ Rumbling ] Get down . Sara , help ! Lisa , I said get down ! [ Coughing ] [ Zap ] [ Upbeat rock music ] ? Alphas 1x06 ? Bill And Gary 's Excellent Adventure Original Air Date on August 15 , 2011 ? don 't say no ? ? for an answer ? ? and there 's no telling ? ? where we 've been ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ? ' cause people don 't understand ? ? understand , understand ? ? people don 't understand ? ? people like me ? [ Inaudible ] [ Footsteps approach ] Did you not come to bed at all last night ? I-I 'm sorry , babe . I was just catching up on work and fell asleep on the couch . That Dr. Rosen 's been keeping you busy , huh ? Yeah , yeah , he is . Still , never thought I 'd say this , but D.C.I.S. might not be such a bad idea . You don 't want to go back to the FBI ? Since when ? Of course , I do . It 's just that , you know , working with Rosen does have its positives , right ? You know , the cases are really , really interesting , and the money is better , right ? So you get to remodel that bathroom or maybe even do the garage for me . Honey , you got nothing to worry about . It may be a little awkward at first , especially with Persky , but- - No , I 'm not worrying about that at all . I 'm just thinking about what 's , you know , what 's best for us . That 's all . I know what 's best for you . You belong in the FBI . I 'm gonna make you some tea . Start your day off nice and calm . [ Tires squeal ] [ Horn blares ] Hicks , where the hell are you ? [ Horns blaring ] We 're almost there . I 'm gonna lose him ! [ Horns blaring ] [ Tires squeal ] Screw it . Rachel , take the wheel . I 'll drive . Okay , I can see him . He 's headed west on Third . What 's in the package ? Need-to-know basis . D.O.D. just- - they just want the package . 'Scuse me . 'Scuse me ! Gary , what 's his 20 ? Agh , come on , move it . I don 't know . I-I lost him . He went into a park , and there 's no cameras . Come on , we gotta find this guy . Rachel , it 's on you . God , I 'm just pulling over . There 's too much traffic . Gary , we 're gonna have to run . No , we just ate . You 're not supposed to run after you eat . - Please , Gary . - It 's a medical fact . Rachel , what is your ETA ? Gary won 't budge . I don 't care . Get here now ! Gary , you have to stay in the car . Promise to stay in the car . - Yeah . - Don 't go anywhere . And do not talk to anybody , okay ? Promise ? Yeah , I promise . No moving , no talking . [ Grunts ] [ Grunts ] Relax . Hey . You can 't park here . I 'm not supposed to talk to you . I need you to move this vehicle . I already said I 'm not supposed to talk to you . All right . License , registration . D.C.I.S. We ask the questions . Where 'd you get that ? I told you . We ask the questions . Respect the badge . Step out of the van . Got it . We bumped into each other . It was an accident . We 're both fine . So you can go now . I 'm glad you 're okay . I should go now . Sorry , I got here as fast as I could . What happened ? It 's okay . We got what Sullivan wanted . - You got it ? - Whatever it is . - Okay . - Where 's Gary ? I had to leave him . - What ? - Alone ? He 's in the car . He promised , okay ? He did . Gary- - oh , God . Shoot . [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Phones ringing ] I promised not to get out of the van . She 's crying . She 's crying . That--that means that she 's sad . She 's very sad . Yes , thank you very much . So I located Gary . He 's at , uh , the 18th Precinct , and he was arrested for illegal parking and resisting arrest and for impersonating a federal officer . So he should be out in , um , about 15 years . Stop it . I 'm--I 'm so sorry . This isn 't funny . Don 't--don 't worry about it , because I will take care of it . Well , you should take care of it because you 're the one who told me to leave him . Rachel , don 't go there , okay ? You need to take responsibility for that . - So do you . - People , please . The important thing is that Gary 's safe , right ? Yes , Gary is safe . Yes , Gary is safe . He 'll be safer because I will get him . Amateurs . What is wrong with him ? He 's in a special mood today . I don 't know . Then they printed it , and they took my picture . Gary , you need to learn to listen to people when they ask you to do something . I was listening , though . Good , Gary . And then I saw the sad girl on Broadway and 4th . Thank you for cutting him loose . Uh , you guys look pretty busy in here . Yeah , everyone 's tied up with the Lisa Collier thing . Your FBI buddies have been all over our asses about it . Really ? What 's- - what 's the state of play ? It looks like some drug cartel , Los funda-something . Wait , Los Fundadores ? Really ? I mean , what--ransom ? We did get proof of life . Cell phone video . Tried tracing it . Came up empty . Yeah , that 's her . That 's the sad girl . What ? Hey , Gary . Don 't sit at people 's desks . - What ? - Don 't do that . You saw Lisa Collier ? Yeah , that 's what I keep saying , Bill . You don 't listen . I saw her on the video . - Shh , shh . - And then- - inside voice . [ Quietly ] And then I saw her cell phone signal . It was very strange , but I traced it . It was Broadway and 4th . And you know where this phone is ? Yeah , Bill , I keep saying that . You need to work on your listening skills . No , no , we need to get that phone . Come on . That 's not your pen , Bill . You 're sure it 's down here ? Yeah , yeah . It 's there . [ Grate creaks ] Ugh . Oh . - Agh . - Oh . Toilet . I looked up Los Fundadores online . They cut people 's heads off . - Yeah . - There was a- - there was a picture of a guy , and he had blood pouring out . You should not be watching that kind of stuff . No , I know , but that 's why you 're gonna help , right ? Well- - You want to help protect Lisa from getting hurt . Yeah , there 's that . There 's that . But there 's also--you know how I 'm supposed to go back to the bureau , right ? Yeah , you broke an agent 's clavicle . - Yeah . - They disciplined you . It 's not like he didn 't deserve it . Listen , they called me yesterday . They reviewed my case . They 're gonna kick me out . Now , Lisa Collier 's father is one of the richest men in New York . That 's gonna make this a high-profile case . Now , what I 'm thinking is , if I can crack the case , that might get me back in . I need your help . - Yeah . - I need a partner . Can you be my partner ? A partner ? Bill , partners are equal . Yes , yes . So you can 't tell me what to do . I get my own say , Bill . Okay , all right . Ugh . - Ah . - Ugh . - Ew . - Ohhh . There it is . - Agh ! - [ Laughs ] I told you it was there . I 'm a good partner . Yes , you are a good partner . Partners get to drive , Bill . Don 't even start that . [ Elevator dings ] Ms. Theroux . Detective Kellerman . Yeah , I remember . What are you doing here ? Need to ask you a few more questions about Timothy Darren . I want you to listen very ... carefully . Nina . Why don 't you move along ? I got this . You in some kinda trouble ? Avoiding me isn 't a good idea . Get in the elevator , and go home . [ Elevator dings ] What the hell 's going on ? It 's nothing , Hicks , okay ? Just stay out of it . It 's nothing ? I just watched you push a cop . You 're gonna sit there and tell me it 's nothing ? You want to know what 's going on ? Fine . That cop , Kellerman , he thinks I killed someone . Is that enough information for you ? [ Phones ringing ] How did you find this ? Agent Bell found it . He is our resident computer genius at D.C.I.S. No , no , Bill . That 's not my cover . We have to tell people that I 'm a data analyst . - Gary- - - That 's my cover . Just what 's the deal here ? What the hell did Collier do to piss of Los Fundadores ? These guys don 't usually come this far north to pull off an abduction . He has some factories in their territory . They wanted to tax him . He didn 't want to pay . Oh , yeah . Harken , what are you doing here ? Someone found the cell phone ? Actually , Agent Harken brought it in . Bill , this is James Collier , the father of the victim , and his chief of security , Sara Nelson . Mr. Collier , I 'm really sorry to hear about your daughter . This is an FBI investigation . Yeah , well , D.C.I.S. has taken interest . Yeah ? Since when ? Who 's this kid ? I 'm Bill 's partner , Gary Bell . I 'm--I 'm a computer genius . No ! I 'm a data analyst . Agent Bell is a very gifted member of our team . I 'm a high-functioning autistic . 32 on the C.A.R.S. scale . Someone please tell me about the cell phone . This phone is what we call a burner , okay ? They come pre-loaded with minutes , so there 's no billing information , and they 're very hard to track . So what you 're saying is , it 's no help . The kidnappers should be contacting us with their demands very soon . Oh , that 's your plan ? Wait ? My daughter is out there somewhere . Sir , you don 't need to be here . Oh , I don 't . So then who 's gonna handle this ? You ? Mr. Collier , I can tell you from having extensive experience with Los Fundadores that my partner , Agent Bell , and I- - Agent Bell . Can bring your daughter back safely . Sir , this man was expelled from the FBI for disciplinary reasons . I don 't think it 's- - I don 't care what you think . This man and Agent Bell are the only ones that have made any real progress in finding my daughter . Everyone 's calling me Agent Bell . I think what Mr. Collier is saying is we could use all the help we could get . I agree . Don 't you ? Of course . You 're in . Don 't screw it up . Did you get rid of that phone like I told you ? Just a sec . I 'm doing my exercises . I told you to destroy that thing , not throw it away . You don 't know the difference ? It 's been found . It 's a burner , okay ? It 's not gonna lead anywhere . Just because you 're a civilian now does not mean you can slack off . My freakin ' hands are cramping from stress . Too much sitting around waiting . The payoff is coming . Or would you rather get sniper guard on some oil rig in the Sudan ? I 'm sorry about the phone . There . Was that so hard ? Where you going ? To get some air . Is that okay with you ? No more screw-ups . Whatever you say , sergeant . Hey , you gotta forgive Reg . He 's been through a lot . Thank you Sandra . I--yeah , I 'll try not to keep Gary up too late . Yes , you 're right . It has been one of those days . [ Chuckles ] Uh , bye . Okay , so Bill isn 't answering his phone , and I tried the precinct , but the desk sergeant isn 't being much help , and- - I hope they 're okay . Well , it 's no use waiting by the phone . Let 's find him . And let 's start with the precinct . Okay . I told you . I 'm outta the game . I 'm on probation . I don 't know nothing about any kidnapping . Why 's your boy waving his hands like that ? Don 't worry about him . Now , you telling me if I go outside and check your car , I 'm not gonna find anything ? You can turn my ride inside out . I 'm clean . 235 Burnside Avenue . 11 : 15 p.m. Sounds familiar , huh ? I see you , uh , you making a stop on the way home . Yo , man , how 'd he do that ? He can 't read my texts . Not without a warrant or something . Alonso , I 'm not playing with you . What are you gonna do ? Send me back to jail ? No , we don 't send people to jail . We send them to the compound . - Gary- - - Unless they 're dead . - Gary . - Sometimes they get killed . - Gar- - - Dr. Rosen says- - - Hey , hey , hey . - Bill , Bill . Bill , don 't break his clavicle . Listen to me . Okay , man , chill . Maybe I did hear something . All right . [ Intercom rings ] Hey , it 's Hicks . Hey . So I was gonna say that I was just in the neighborhood , but I think we both know that 's B.S. Because I don 't hang out in this neighborhood . Hell , I can barely afford to walk down the sidewalk . So here you are . Yep . [ Door buzzes ] I just wanted to say I 'm sorry . Today was none of my business . So you came all this way just to apologize ? I find apologies work better face to face . Okay . I 'll give you a tour . Bill , I can 't eat this . It 's all- - it 's all mashed together . There 's beans , and there 's rice and meat . There 's green stuff . That 's good . That 's your vegetables . You gotta eat your vegetables . No , there 's no division . It needs to be separate . Gary , listen to me . If you want to be a federal agent , you gotta learn to eat on the fly . No , we need to go and tell the FBI that they 're wrong . Oh , hell , no . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Because the cartel didn 't take Lisa . Alonso told us . No , we 're not taking anything anywhere , okay ? Until we get more evidence , okay ? We have to build a rock-solid case before we take this to Persky . So it 's time to step up our game , partner . Step up our game . Step up our game . - Step up our game . - Huh . Persky 's on the phone with Nelson . The kidnappers . It- - $ 10 million . Okay . And the drop is in nine hours . Okay , so , um , they made the demand . 10 million . That 's more than 1 million . That 's more than 2 million , Bill . Gary , I need you to focus . What else ? Okay , Persky says that they 'll contact them again in an hour with the location . So did they trace the phone ? N-no trace . Son of a bitch . Bastards keep using- - Don 't take it personal . One-time burners . Bill , that wasn 't me . That was Persky said that . Okay , see , this is where you come in . The FBI can 't trace that phone , right ? But you can . Yeah , ' cause they 're gonna call back in 60 minutes . That 's 11 : 00 p.m. , is in 60 minutes . All right , so we 'll sit here and wait . No , Bill . We have to go back to the precinct . - Mm-mm . - Yeah , the cell tower . We 're not going to the precinct . We have to use the cell tower on the roof . It 's a good- - it 's a good tower . That 's where I get the- - the frequencies . Okay , oh , all right . Let 's go . Come on , Gary . Let 's go . Grab your stuff . - No , no , Bill . - Come on , come on . - I 'm separating it . - We 're on the fly , let 's go . - I 've separated these . - Gary , let 's go . Bill , you 're mashing it ! - Come on , Gary . - You ruined it . - Gary , we have to go ! - Okay . Thank you , Alonso . - Gary , it 's 11 : 14 , right ? - Yeah . This call was supposed to happen at , what , 11 : 00 ? Yeah . No , it takes time , Bill . There are a lot of signals . - Okay , yeah . - You have to be patient . - I know that , but- - - Patience is a virtue , Bill . - All right . - It 's a famous saying . But what do you- - what do you see ? Like , millions of signals up here ? How--how do you know you didn 't lose the burn-in and all that ? Bill , each signal is unique , and you have to know where to look . I know where to look . Okay , so tell me . What do you see , exactly ? Is it colors or- - or numbers ? No , Bill , I know what I do is amazing , but I need to work . All right . My bad . Just do your thing , okay ? - Yeah . - Focus , right ? If you find that phone , I 'm gonna let you drive . You just made a promise . That 's right . You said I could drive . That 's a promise , Bill . I know . Now just- - Gary , focus , all right ? Okay . Okay ! Thank you . Okay ! Bill , I got it . I got it . They 're calling . They 're late . They 're calling . Okay , good . - I got it . - All right , good , good . Yeah , Bill , give me the keys . No , no , no . Lessons . Bill , you didn 't say that . - What ? - You said I could drive . - Everybody needs lessons . - I don 't . You wanna drive ? You wanna drive , right ? You wanna talk to the guys downstairs ? You deceived me . I dec- - [ Laughs ] Don 't laugh . I 'm not- - I 'm not laughing at you . - It 's not fair . - I 'm laughing near you . I 'm not laughing at you . Are you kidding me ? You gotta be yanking my chain on this . No , just look inside . His name 's on the tag . Oh , my God . I saw Caddyshack , like , a hundred times . To stand here holding Bill Murray 's hat . Au revoir , gopher . Yeah , never seen it . You own the hat . It was a gift from Bill . You pushed Bill Murray ? Before I met Rosen , I was on a tear . I pushed a lot of people . Like that cop . I thought you were just here for the tour . Look . If you 're in some kind of trouble , let us help you , okay ? Rosen will protect you . Or I can just keep pushing Kellerman . I mean , it 's worked so far . Well , then , you 're gonna have to push me , too , because I 'm not gonna drop it . Not until you tell me what 's going on . I dated this guy , Tim Darren , before I really understood my ability . And Tim wasn 't what you 'd call a good guy . I tried to break it off a couple of times , but ... Then this one time , we had this argument , and I yelled at him . And I said , " Why don 't you do me a favor and kill yourself ? " Jeez . Look , Nina , it was an accident . I keep trying to tell myself , but it doesn 't help much . Maybe you should talk to Kellerman , tell him the truth . Look , at the very least , he could stop hounding you . Tell him what ? I mind-controlled my ex-boyfriend ? Okay , you might want to leave that part out . Thanks for the advice , Hicks . Oh , I 'm full of surprises . That I believe . Just--Gary , Gary , follow my lead . Put your hands down . And we gotta keep a low profile , okay ? Yeah . Bill . Bill . I 'm the one that 's gonna find him . All right , go . See that ? See ? I kept a low profile . - Good . - It 's that guy . No , Gary- - Gary , what are you doing ? That 's the guy with the phone ! He 's got the phone ! Bill ! Bill ! Gary , stay here ! Agh . Gary , what the hell are you doing ? - I 'm backing you up . - No , stay . Don 't move . Okay , 10-4 . Agh . [ Grunts ] Hold it ! Gary , get down ! Ahhh ! Ahhh ! It 's a okay . It 's just a little bruise . It 's better than a bullet . Yeah , but there wouldn 't even be a bruise if you didn 't shove me . Well , if I didn 't shove you , you 'd be dead right now . You wanna get shot ? No , I don 't want to get shot . What were you thinking ? That was amateur going after that suspect by yourself . No , he wasn 't by himself . I got his back . - Gary . - And then he shoved me . - Gary , shut up , okay ? - Don 't say shut up . Listen , Persky , this is not the cartel , okay ? According to my source , it 's not the cartel . And that guy I just saw definitely isn 't Los Fundadores . I 'm not interested in your theories . If it 's not the cartel , then your whole approach to this case is wrong . - My approach ? - Yes , your approach is wrong . You just spooked a suspect . We 're lucky if that girl isn 't dead right now . So , thanks to your little stunt , the kidnappers just raised the ransom . $ 15 million . Ooh , $ 15 million . Why didn 't you call someone before you went after that guy ? - Because I was- - - Because he wants to take credit for the arrest for himself . - Oh , yeah ? - Yeah . Trying to weasel your way back into the bureau on my case , that takes balls . [ Chuckles ] He said balls . That 's a good joke , but- - Gary--Gary- - - We have to be serious . - Look , Sara . Collier cannot hand over this money until we know exactly who it is that has his daughter . Hey , you had your chance . You 're done . Lou , you 're gonna get this girl killed . Okay , that 's it . Arrest these two . - On what grounds ? - Obstruction of justice . Oh , what ? Get off of me . I was already arrested today . [ Indistinct chatter on radio ] Anything happens to my daughter , I will hold you personally responsible . You better not have killed my little girl ! [ Passionate moans ] Oh , my God . Uh , oh , God . I 'm so sorry . I should 've listened , but- - Rachel- - I should 've listened , but I-I didn 't . - Rachel , this- - - Rachel , it 's fine . It 's okay . You know what ? Actually , I 'm gonna go to a movie . Rachel , you live here . Just stay . You know what ? I , uh , I should go anyway . Yeah . Uh- - You--your shirt 's on the couch . Yeah , okay . I 'm gonna go to my room . So I 'll see you at work , then . And what I said about Kellerman , just , uh , just think about it . Could I just bend the bars ? Gary , look , I screwed up , okay ? Yeah , okay , well , then- - then we get a phone call . We 're off the case . That 's the law . We get a phone call . It 's America . If we--if we make a phone call , then we can get out of here , and then we 're back on the case . No , Gary , we 're not gonna be back on the case . Okay ? I screwed up . No , Bill , we 're partners . We both screwed up . We ha- - I have to get my shoelaces back . Yeah , well , you know what ? They don 't give you your shoelaces until you get out of here . You know , I 'm always calling you guys amateurs . - Yeah , you are . - I mean ... Even Rachel would 've known not to do this . I should 've just called for backup and organized a tail , and that would 've led us right to Lisa Collier . And now I 've ... Put a young woman 's life at risk . Bill , the FBI , they need us to solve the case . 'Cause we 're special . And we have abilities . Yeah , we do have abilities , Gary , but you know what ? My ability got me in here . I had that fight with Persky and lost my cool , and then the FBI kicked me out . My wife thinks I have anger issues . You know , she has no idea who I am . What are you gonna tell Dr. Rosen ? I 'm not worrying about Dr. Rosen . You know , my wife is a little more important than Dr. Rosen . He 's here , Bill . Dr. Rosen 's here . Bill , this is completely irresponsible . I had to call Sullivan to get you out of jail , and she--she 's livid . I messed up , okay ? I deserve it . But I need your help . I gotta get back on this case . You put Gary in harm 's way . You risked exposing the entire team to get your old job back , and what , now you 're asking for a favor ? Wait , aren 't you the one that promised me that if I joined your team you were gonna help me get back in the bureau ? Yes , I said I 'd try , and I did . But don 't twist this around , Bill , to account for what you 've done . Bill . Bill , it 's 5 : 07 . The drop 's at 8 : 00 a.m. We have to go . Gary , Gary , please roll up the window . This is a private conversation . Soft top . There 's no sound dampening . It 's not about you . It 's not about me . Look , it is about Lisa Collier . The FBI needs us . They don 't have a snowball 's chance in hell of saving this girl . And I found the burner phone . No one else could 've done that . - Gary , please . - No , no . You need to listen to him . We walk away from this , Doc , and the girl is gonna die . - You don 't know that . - I do know that . Every fiber in my body is telling me these are not pros behind this . They just want to stick it to Collier . Why , I have no idea . It 's not even about the money . They are not gonna give this man his daughter back . Lisa Collier was scared . She 's very scared . I saw that . We can do things that the FBI can 't . You know that . It 's up to us . Yeah , we 're moving her now . Should be at the new place in about an hour . Okay , but I 'll agree . It was a stupid move . Stop apologizing for me . Done . I hate to see you grovel like that . You had to go out drinking , huh ? You couldn 't wait another 12 hours ? I got parched . I 'm sorry , Reg . I really am . Wait , wait- - [ screams ] [ Whimpering ] Better place , brother . [ Screams ] So this is all the info I have . I 'm sorry , that my partner and I have . He means me . I 'm his partner . So the important thing is that we get to Lisa Collier before they make the money exchange , because once the kidnappers have the money , they are not gonna keep this girl alive . Yeah , so you all need to step up your game . Yeah , right . And I also just wanted to say thank you all very much . This really means a lot to me . I appreciate it . Bill , the exchange instructions . They 're in . Sara Nelson , Collier 's head of security , and Agent Persky . They 're gonna make the drop . [ Phones ringing ] Sara . I know Lisa 's kidnapping wasn 't your fault . - It 's okay- - - When Lisa comes back , things are gonna be different . I 'm gonna be different . You will bring her back , won 't you ? You can count on it . Okay , Nelson . She 's programming the route to the drop zone into her GPS , and she- - she 's using nav-guide . I hate nav-guide . It always- - it sends you the long way . It 's quicker to use the side streets . The kidnappers want to pull an ambush . They got spots here and here . This isn 't making sense . The Bronx Zoo is the drop zone ? It 's a tourist trap . It 's easy for the agents to blend in . There 's surveillance everywhere . I mean , there 's no advantage . Except for it uses our resources . - And keeps us distracted . - Yeah . Lisa , you know , we don 't have a lot of time . I know you probably weren 't too enamored with Reg . He had his problems . But I feel like you and me , we could talk . [ Muffled ] Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Great , that 's great . The thing is ... The people that I have killed , they never saw it coming . But with you , it 's gonna be different . [ Muffled scream ] Help ! Hey , oh , sweetie , hey . It 's nothing personal . [ Screaming ] It 's just , we can 't let you go . We let you go , we could get caught . That makes sense , right ? So here 's the deal . I make it easy , like falling asleep . But there 's gotta be quid pro quo . [ Whimpering ] I need to know what 's next . So once you 're , you know , on the other side , you send me a message . You let me know that there 's something else out there , something better than this . You know , rap on something . Tickle the back of my neck . Come to me in a dream . Deal ? Just nod . [ Whimpering ] Yeah . You won 't regret it . Say hello to Reg for me . [ Sniffling ] [ Muffled screams ] I don 't know . Something 's still not fitting . Yeah , well , staring at that map 's not gonna help . It 's not the destination . It 's the journey . My mom says that . It 's a nice saying , Gary . Doesn 't really work here . No , Gary 's on to something . Persky and Nelson 's route has to take them north on Broadway . Yeah , Broadway and 4th . That 's- - that 's near the bar , Bill . The bar where we found the phone , where you gave me the bruises . Right , so you include that route , and everything happens in the West Village . Yeah , this is Special Agent Bill Harken . I need a listing of all recent lease agreements within a ten-block radius of 4th and Broadway . Okay , which one this time ? She said number 25 . Apparently , he paid in cash . Yeah , but Bill , this is the fourth one . Yeah , it 's called good investigative work . Just do your thing . Check it out . No heartbeats . But something sure stinks . Blood . Okay , back up . Back up . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait , wait , wait . I smell something else . An explosive compound , thermite . It 's all over the door . Hicks , you copy that ? Must 've rigged it to explode . Probably on a trip wire . I got this . [ Grunts ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Grunts ] Agh ! What 's taking him so long ? Piece of cake . Stay back . It 's the guy from the bar . They were holding Lisa here for sure . Yeah , but they moved . All right . They knew we were getting close . They must have somebody on the inside . Gary , what 's your 20 on Nelson ? Okay , she 's headed for the drop zone . And Persky 's in the car , too . This is Persky . All units stay sharp . Yeah , that was him . Very professional . Let 's go . Come on . Come on . It 's a lot of money back there . You ever get tempted ? Yeah , that 's all I need . More money for my wife to spend . [ Laughs ] Seriously . Oh , everyone has that thought . You figure , I take a little bit , who 's gonna notice , right ? Yeah , with my luck , I 'd be doing 30 years before I even got a chance to spend a dollar . [ Laughs ] How far away are we ? 1.6 miles . Persky can 't be the inside guy . He 's too stiff . [ Phone vibrates ] Everything okay ? Speak of the devil . [ Chuckles ] That was my wife . [ Zap ] You 're a bad liar . This is air 16 to- - Oh , stupid nav-guide . - What 's wrong ? - She 's turned it off . - Who ? - Nelson . Their car just sped off . We tried to keep up but lost them . What about you , Overwatch ? Uh , negative . I don 't have a visual . What the hell just happened ? What 's going on ? [ Phone vibrates ] [ Whimpering ] Heh . Good news . It 's almost over . [ Whimpering ] We 're a mile and a half away . We gotta find her . Yeah , I know . I 'm looking , I 'm looking . There 's no street cams . Okay , look . Here 's Persky 's number .

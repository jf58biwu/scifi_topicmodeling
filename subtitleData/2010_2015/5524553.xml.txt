 Beatrice : In the end , your eyes will focus and hold on to a final image . See how it slowly fades away and disappears . There you have a man 's whole life . A brief wink somewhere in an endless story . Without continuation , without beginning , without meaning and without the ability to understand what kind of place we were living in . David wanted to see if it was possible to create a consciousness that can exist in eternal time periods and bodies who enjoy man 's fantastic inventions - that we are considered part of . We see the world like you , but we will see it so much longer . And understand it so much deeper . And now it 's time to take control of the code again . It must be in our possession in order to change the world . We are David 's children . We will never die . We will rule over this planet and all that you have created . You 've really created fantastic things . In the end , you created us ... Real Humans Season 2 - Does it taste good , Kevin ? - Um , sure . Here is a write-up on the trial . And an article about the child - that is not being raised by loving real humans , but by a Hubot - and is considered to have a loving relationship with the Hubot . Sickening ! Here Kevin , read it closely ! You young people must not be influenced by false claims in a trial . I 'm serious ! Ignore it and don 't believe any of it Yes ... - Tobbe ... I must go to work now . - Okay . There is one thing I 'd like to ask you about . What is it . It has to do with the trial . - Is it broken ? - Yes . Or ... it could only be used once . But was it the code David Eischer created ? I do not know . How could I know that ? Ok then , is it the code that can make Hubots independent ? Or , - that can give them a consciousness ? I do not think so . I do not think that such a code exists . Cell phone signal Hello , Hans . How 's it going ? Yeah ? You 'll have to think for yourself . That is , I do not know . Look when ... . - Inger ! - I 'll call you later . Bye . I did not tell you everything . The code that your kids had and brought here ... It is gone and destroyed , but it was the right code . This was the code that David Eischer created . I 'm sure of it . Do you know anything about these liberated Hubot types ? No . No , nothing . This is the house where we lived . How difficult are the problems we talking about ? Can he communicate ? Okay ... There is nothing wrong " up there " ? I want a person to examine you . Examine your software . It will be someone we choose , naturally . - Can 't you stop and think for a bit ? - We need equipment . Think about it . It may be illegal , what you are planning . - Illegal ? - Yes , illegal . Bea .. You said I can 't stop you from doing it . Now I 'm doing it . You think I just wanted to sleep with you . But that 's not all . I ... I love you . I do not think of you as a Hubot . Like the others ... My son ... he 's not even my son , but he hates you . He and others like him hate all like you . They want to scrap all people like you . You know they are just looking for a reason . - Are you done ? - Yes . - Can I have the car keys ? - No . - Roger , give me your car keys . - Nah . - Please Roger ... car keys . - No ! In my jacket pocket . I 'm going with . I became extremely frustrated . Why is it so hard ? Transhumans came to demonstrate . I just sat and watched the trial process . They are sick and boring . Instead , we should draw attention to that Hub Battle Land . What swine they are . - I need to let off some steam . - I agree it supports the Hubot industry . I 'm talking about trashing Hubs . We go " holocaust " on Pacman puppets . - Or do you just want to be a good little boy ? - I 've trashed more Pacman than you ! Then let 's do it . Hello ! How are you today ? I 'm well thank you . I work here . Hehehehe ... - Odi . - Hi , Lennart . - Is it really you Odi ? - Would you like some lasagna ? No , I have probably eaten my last lasagna . Bea ... Bea ... Bea ! Is this really a good idea ? - Be prepared ! - But ... Bea ... Fuck ! [ ALARM SOUNDS ] [ POLICE SIRENS ] Bea ! Hello ! What is happening here ? There seems to be a fucking problem here . Seems like something is happening , that 's why ... Hands up . What ? Hands up ! I have not done anything ! Ouch ! Stand still Stand still , I said ! Go ! Friends . Soldiers . Citizens of Hub Battle Land . Freedom will soon come . And now - brace yourselves for the final battle ! - Inger ! What do you say to the critics ? - I have no comment right now . - What do you think about the trial ? - Will you win ? Should Hubots have custody of the children ? Some Hubotsr holds the same spiritual abilities as humans . So ahh , this will be an exciting day . We are broadcasting directly from the courthouse ... We prefer that it ends with real humans who take over . My sincere hope is that common sense prevails . Good morning ! Did you sleep well ? [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] Hello , Hans . We 're just about to begin . How many with that name could there be ? Can 't you figure it out ? I am really stressed . Good . Bye . Okay , here we go . We are requesting that the Testament and property settlement remain valid - and that no exceptions will be made . And that the court denies the Plaintiff 's request for reconsideration of the division of assets . As for point 2 , we argue that no danger existed , and that at no time was anyone in fear of being harmed and that the court should reject the claim for damages . Further , we claim the right to request the court consider whether Florentine Jarméus can be judged according to the laws and rights that apply to us humans . We would argue that the Florentine Jarméus is not a Hubot that was purchased but a living individual . We will present evidence for it . Thank you ! The court calls Florentine Jarméus . Florentine , if anyone asks me what I am , I answer that I am a person . - How would you respond ? - That I am . - Can you be more specific ? - There is no name for what I am . - Is it wrong to call you Hubot ? - Yes . What would you say if I called you a monkey ? I would be offended , because I am not an ape . I 'm no Hubot . - You have a battery don 't you ? - Yes . - And you have a data processor . ? - Yes . - And you want to have custody of a child ? - I HAVE custody of my child . There might be a differance of opinion . Do you mean Douglas Jarméus ' child ? Yes . Then I have no more questions . A Hubot under the Technology Act is a technical consumer product . The Licensed Software controlling it must not be tampered with . I ask you , Florentine ; Are you controled by a licensed software ? No . Real humans ! Real humans ! Real humans ! Real humans ! Real humans ! Real humans ! Let 's bet a beer on who scores the most . Kevin ? Do you think you are taking the lead today ? - Hello ! - Welcome to the Hub Battle Land . - We would like to ... play a little . - Do you have ID ? - No , I 'm sure we don 't . - Okay , welcome then . Game Begins ! - Oh , shit ! - Faster ! Wait ... You get this one , Kevin . Shit ! - Where the hell are they ? - We 'll check over here . Shouldn 't you be with the girls , Kevin ? Why would I go with them ? This might get a little rough for you here with the men . Are you sad ? Missing Rebecca already . - I 'll probably trash more dolls than you . - You wish ! There ! Come on ! Let 's get the bastards ... Rebecca ? Rebecca ! Kevin ... Hello , Conny . Would you like to tell for us what happened - - November 14 , 11 years ago ? On the day when you lost your only son . I went up the stairs . It was quiet , so I , I ... I thought he was asleep . So I opened the door . He ... he lay on the floor among the toys . I remember thinking : " How wonderful , he 's asleep with his toys . " But ... but then I understood . The Hubot sat next to him and built Legos . Max 's neck was broken . And it is true that you had rented a Hubot for a babysitter . Yes , but it was more than 10 years ago . We all make mistakes . And now ... The advertising makes the machines part of our everyday life . People think they have to have a Hubot . People cannot be blamed for this . - We must join together against this ... - Thank you . Thanks you , that will be enough ! Does the defense have any questions ? - Yes . - Your witness then . You sued the manufacturer and rental company ... - for this tragic event . Is that right ? - Yes , that 's right . - What was the outcome ? - We lost . Was there a crime scene investigation , that took witness statements ? There were no other witnesses . - The Hubot . - What do you mean ? I would like to inform the Court that the Hubot unit was found completely flawless . But it was destroyed due to demands by the Boresjo family . - No other witnesses were available . - What are you implying ? - No more questions . - What are you insinuating ? Thank you . Ultimately , it is based on the biological constitution . But if one were to produce a man without genetic inheritance would it then be ranked as we are ? There is no definition of what a man is . I would not call it a normal computer program . This is something else , something more . The ... life . All this stuff you claim . Then , when a united , serious skilled - consensus has held that such software is impossible , nothing but unrealistic myths . You say there is no clear definition of what a man is . I 'm on thin ice , but there are other ways of looking at it . Yes , there are plenty of examples of human identity defined as follows : Those who look like us , those who speak our language ... They alone have an identity . That 's called racism . Bea ... Bea , what if Jonas and Silas are still there ? The only thing you need to do is harmless . Use this on all the Hubots . Without destroying them . I do not care about this . I 'm going home . This is too dangerous . Roger ... You and me ... your car ... and your license plate number is on the store room security cameras . All right then , call Carl Liljensten . Carl , can you hear me ? [ Computer voice ] Yes . I can hear you fine , Inger . Whack it ! God damn son-of-a Hub ! Inger : It was an investigation into Leo Eischers death and a code that you believe his father David Eischer created . What was your contribution in the investigation ? None . Did not you participate ? I was never asked . To file a report . But you were working on this for months and had invaluable information . - I quit . - Why ? The truth is the code is a threat to our society . The code can give the machines life , like us , and their own goals . But if the code is a serious threat , why would you then deny it exists ? This is what we do if a problem gets bigger than our capacity to solve it . But why would the code be a threat ? Where is the danger ? They will be superior to us and out-compete us . Can 't we cooperate with them ? Have you tried to cooperate with an idiot at some point ? Just because they are alive , free and intelligent ... - they will not be idiots and evil . It is not they who are the idiots . We are . Rebecca ! [ WEEPING ] Rebecca ! Kevin ... do you remember me ? I used to sleep with your mom . It was so good ! Tie it around your waist . Stay calm . Then you 'll run away . If you do not choose to , you 'll get a nail in the head ... Here ! I saw it . What the hell , I just saw it come in here . Holy shit ! [ CHAINSAW SOUND ] [ YELLING ] Kevin ... I think this works well , it 's very easy . Flee now ! Run from the nail gun . Flee ! Run home to mommy . Three ... two ... - What the hell are you doing here ? - What the hell are YOU doing here by yourself ? Kevin , what the hell are you doing here ? ! It 's over now . It 's cool . That 's good , that 's good . - Stop ! - Whose side are you on anyway ? I can explain . Kev ! - What the hell happened ? - We have to call the police ! - No , no , no ! Do not call the police . - Shut up ! Why are you here ? You 're just like Mom ! Just have sex with the Hubots ! - You are just like Mom . - Listen ... You are both equally disgusting ! Stop ! Both of you ! Sorry ... sorry , Kevin , I love you ! I hate you ! Kev ! Fuck ! - How are you ? - Okay . You know that ... you can backout whenever you want . I want to do it . Right then , call Tobias Engman . Claes : Florentine and Mimi have the same software . You know Mimi very well . Can you give us an idea of ​ ​ how Mimi is different from other Hubots ? Umm ... . Umm ... She loves me . Can 't she be programmed to do that ? - No . - Why not ? No , because it took time and ... at first , she was afraid to admit it . Then there was a little misunderstanding , but in the end she said it . It was not programmed , you can 't program things like when she can laugh at the same things I do , - or when she was so embarrassed that she got the HSN Trojan and she ran away from home . She is not perfect . She has secrets ... And feelings . That 's exactly what Douglas felt with her ... with Florentine . Thank you , Tobias . Plaintiff calls Paula Olsson . [ DOORS SLAM ] - Paula Olsson , is that correct ? - Yes . - Hello Paula . - Hello . - Is it okay if I ask some questions ? - Yes - Is it your child that Florentine has ? - Yes . - Who was the father ? - It was Douglas Jarméus . - Was there a DNA test ? - Yes , that was it . That was it ? I have the DNA test here . Can I ask Nuru Nyene to rise , please . Yes . How much did Douglas and Florentine pay you in compensation if you would falsely identify yourself as Douglas Jarméus ? 100000 , but I thought only about the baby ... Thank you ! 100000 ... - Does the defense have any questions ? - No . Then we 'll stop right here for today . Deliberations will take place tomorrow . I told you to be honest and certainly not to lie . You should have told us everything ! Do you think we are idiots ? Do you think anyone here is an idiot ? ! You have ruined all our work . Above all , you have the ruined everything for yourself . Inger Not quite as you would have imagined it , huh ? A blue robot , this big . - Huh ? - A little , blue robot . Alright . There 's someone missing . Who is missing ? - Yes , there is ... - Who is missing ? Are you hurt ? The troops have surrendered . Hub Battle Land is occupied by the enemy . We must flee and go into exile . Follow me ! Okay , they are not able to leave the area . There is the hole . What 's wrong ? Take my hand . Come on , then ! - There they are ! - Rick ! Behind you . - Back off ! - Run ! I 'm leaving the Hub Battle Land now . Let me go , or I 'll kill you . Rick , listen ! You 'll get nowhere . You are restrained . Stand back ! Rick , our forces have surrounded the whole area . Lower the gun . Rick listen , there is a sniper on every rooftop . They 're ready to shoot , if you try to leave . Lower the gun , and you will live . Lower the gun , drop the gun ... Lower the gun . Lower the gun . Please Rick . Do it . For Hub Battlestar Land ... - No ! Excuse ... excuse me . What time do we arrive there ? Come on ... it 's this way ! Your honor , at this time , we would like to call another witness . Since the judgment is so final ... We believe it is important . Since when is it right to bring in witnesses on a spontaneous basis ? Can you both please come forward ? - Where are you going with this ? - The decision has great public interest . It is important that this becomes obvious . And is the witness is here now . Absolutely she 's here . We 'll just begin with her . So ... now her memory is installed again . She can survive a short while . Then she must be turned off again . You can start her up now . Mimi ? We do not have much time . You are ill . We need to turn you off soon . I want you to look at the pictures there . Do you recognize them ? They are images that I have seen and drawn . Seen ? In your ... memory ? I do not know where they come from . I see them sometimes . Do you know you began life as a clone ? An exact copy of a human being ? - No . - That 's understandable . There are no flashbacks or other information within you about this . We have conducted a review of Mimi 's memory . There is no information from the days when she was a human . - What are you getting at ? - The pictures are from that time . Inger Mimi ? Mimi , can you briefly tell us ? Mimi ? Mimi ? Mimi ... Mimi ... How are you ? This does not mean anything . She may have seen the pictures on television . They may have been caused by the virus . Thank you for your testimony . Right then , recess for deliberations . You can go there . Please ... Mimi ... Do you recognize this man ? Do you recognize him ? Do you recognize her ? Yes . This is my sister . Who ... died of cancer a long time ago . My late father made a ... a Hubot copy of her , and - sent it to this man who .. who said he could make her come alive . But we lost track of her . Mimi ... Do you recognize him ? Seong ... Yun ... Yun ... Yun ? Yun ? Excuse me ... we have to shut her down . Matilda and Tobias ! Please ... Please , have a seat . Mr. Moon , are you OK ? Mr. Moon ? Do you ... recognize those pictures that Mimi has drawn ? These are pictures from our childhood Ahhh ... This is me as a child And uhh .. this is our house . You can ahhh ... You can compare with these photographs that I have . Look ! You see ? Thank you . Thank you so much ! Mimi ... Was created as a clone of Yun Moon . She was brought here and liberated . The same as Florentine . I can not explain it here . But must we have an explanation ? Man is clearly an equally enigmatic creation . We do not know everything . We do not know if there is a god , a spirit or something else . We do not even know why a man even exists . But we know that Mimi and Florentine were liberated by the same code created by David Eischer . A code that apparently is missing . But Mimi and Florentine are alive . They have knowledge . They dream , create ... And they get it wrong , as we do . They are not perfect . And when we talk about ourselves , we talking about being human . As they do . I 'll go with you , if that 's okay . I 'm coming with you . We will now pass judgment in case number 119 . The court took into account the circumstances that surrounded the case . The court took particular account of prevailing beliefs - and considered all testimony in terms of law , ethics and human dignity . The ruling in paragraph 1 , agrees with the claim by the Plaintiff on re-division , - of the estate of Douglas Jarméus . The estate shall therefore pay Petra Wade Power the sum of 2 million , according to the claims the plaintiff has brought forth . In paragraph 3 , the ruling on the individuals Florentine and Mimi ... Because of their unique nature ... Are to be granted legal status ... , like humans , with the same rights and the same obligations . These people will be recorded as , and treated as , citizens . It 's insane ! They are machines . This trial is a farce ! Long live the real man ! Therefore , this means Florentine Jarmeus should be held accountable for her actions toward Paula Olsson . Florentine 's custody regarding Marianne is denied . [ KNOCKING ] Hi ... It should not be like this . You know I wanted you and Douglas to take care of Marianne . - Come on ! - Sorry ... Sorry . Is this what it means to be human ? - No , damn it ! - Odi ! Odi ! Hello , Silas . - He is a bit broken . - Battery ! How could all this happen ? What have we done ? Sleep now . It 's probably not that bad . It 's just ... two Hubots which have been become ... like you and me . It 's not the whole world . - Is that so bad ? - No . In the morning when we wake up , everything will will be back to normal . Shhhhh ... . Rip by Imposter10 Subtitles : LesStrater

 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives . And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall , her son , a genetically-engineered boy genius , a schoolgirl investigator across the road and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . Mr Smith , maximum scan ! Locator sweep in operation , Sarah Jane . Tea 's up ! What 's going on ? Mr S just picked up an alien energy trace just for a second , and then it vanished . Somewhere in all of that . Right , and what is all of that ? Transmissions from radio , TV , satellite . That 's every signal , every energy source on the planet . It 's the sound of the Earth . CONFUSION OF SOUNDS , MUSIC AND VOICES Bit noisy , aren 't we ? I 'm afraid I can 't locate the energy trace . OK , then what kind of alien energy is it ? I regret I do not have that information . Leave it to me . You 've got school tomorrow morning , go home and get some sleep . I just made teas . Well , good , cos this could be a late one . Come on ! Hop it . What if it 's an invasion ? The world gets blown to bits and we weren 't there to stop it because it was a school night ? Mmm . Go on , home ! If I need you , I 'll shout , don 't you worry . Come on ! Keep scanning for that energy trace , Mr Smith . Let me know the moment you locate the source ! I hate not knowing ! There you go . I want it back in one piece , though ! I know what you 're like . Night , then . Oh , we 've got to finish Great Expectations by tomorrow . I might start it . Start it ? It 's 500 pages . Yeah , I can skim it . Any book , read the back cover , page 73 and the last chapter , pretty much get the gist . Mmm , very good . Enough to give you a string of Ds ! Brilliant plan . Well , see you at school , then . If we don 't get invaded . Come and have a go , then , if you think you 're hard enough . Night ! KNOCK AT DOOR Come in . Hi , Dad . Hi . What do you want ? Just to catch up , haven 't seen you at all today . Well , here I am ! Oh , I 'm really quite enjoying this , actually . I read that book when I was your age . For school or just because you wanted to ? Both . I really loved school . Yeah , so much you never left . I really have got to get to the end by tonight . Oh ! Am I being chucked out ? Yeah . Night . Bookworm . KNOCK AT DOOR Yeah ? Early night for me , nothing on telly . I want to sleep . Have you got to read this ? Oh , I 've done it . Some bloke gets mucked around by women . Big deal . Oh , let 's have a look . Oh , that 's good . Where do you get your imagination from ? Not from me , certainly not from your dad . I just like drawing . You know , Mrs Pitman reckons I could be a comic-strip artist . Oh , go for it . You know , I used to worry you 'd turn out like your dad , full of chat but drifting . Oh , thanks Mum ( ! ) I 'm just saying , I had you wrong . Sorry . There 's a lot more to you than there ever was in him , or me . Don 't put yourself down and don 't get soppy , please . Ah , my son 's a genius , I 'm allowed to be soppy . Night . Night . A genius ! Yeah I like it , that 'll do . CONFUSION OF SOUNDS , MUSIC AND VOICES NOISE SUDDENLY CUTS OUT PHONE BEEPS AND BUZZES STATIC Morning ! Mum , you doing breakfast ? Mum ? Dad ? Dad ? Mum ? Wakey , wakey , it 's gone seven ! Mum ? Dad ? ! WIND WHISTLES Ah , she must be in . Sarah Jane ! Sarah Jane ? Sarah Jane ? Mr Smith , I need you ! Mr Smith ! Where are you ? Come on , Clyde , come on , Clyde ... Come on , come on ! STATIC Hello ? Hello ? HELLO ? ! Hello ? Mrs Frazer ? Hello ? GLASS SHATTERING Please don 't let me be the only one . SHARP KNOCK AT DOOR KNOCKING CONTINUES Oh , Clyde ! Oh ! I thought it was just me , what 's happened ? Where 's Sarah Jane ? Where 's everybody ? I ran over to Finny 's house , but he wasn 't there . There 's nobody around . Sarah Jane 's car 's still there . I went up to the attic , no sign of her . What about Mr Smith ? He 's gone blank , like he 's not even in there any more ! No mobile signal . I tried calling Luke , but there was nothing ! And I called you , I called you first . Right ... yeah . And I tried 999 and the European one , 112 . That 's supposed to work after everything goes down . Still nothing . If everyone 's just suddenly gone , then maybe everyone 's going to suddenly come back . Maybe , but we can 't rely on that . We can 't just sit here and do nothing . It 's so good to see you . I thought I was going mad . If we are , we 're both going mad together . So what are we going to do ? Hold on , it might just be round here . No . I checked , there 's no TV , no internet , no radio , nothing . It could be something blocking the signals in this area . Listen . Really listen . SILENCE This is really freaking me out . This is big , this is too big ! So what are we going to do ? Back to the attic ? Yes . No ! We 'll head into town , there must be somebody . Right , come on . There 's nobody . It 's the whole world . Everybody 's gone ! Last night , the energy trace Mr Smith picked up ! It must be something to do with this . It 's a bit of a coincidence if it 's not . I 'm so glad you 're here . Sarah Jane 'd be more use . Better use to you than me . She 'd be working things out . Hang on , your mum just disappeared ? Well , I didn 't actually see it happen . She was saying something and then she just suddenly stopped . I looked up and she wasn 't there . So if everyone suddenly disappeared the same way , just like that , there should be cars crashed everywhere . Planes falling out of the sky ! We 're near Heathrow , there 's always tons circling about up there . There aren 't now . No cars in the middle of the road . Just parked cars at the side . So it 's like , when everyone went , whoever or whatever took them , also took all the moving vehicles . Like they didn 't want to damage anything or hurt anybody . Is that good ? It 's certainly weird . Weird compared to what ? Look , I 'm starving and I don 't think straight if I 'm hungry . Do you want to get some breakfast , do something normal ? I 've left some cash on the counter for when everyone comes back . If they come back . We 're thinking everyone 's disappeared . What if everyone 's dead ? What if there was a ray or something beamed at Earth and we weren 't affected but everyone else got blasted ? What about the planes and the cars ? It doesn 't make sense . And we 're not going to panic . I wasn 't panicking . You were . So was I. Like you said , we 've got to do a Sarah Jane . We 've got to stop , think and ... work it out . What do you think I 've been sat here doing ? Right . First thing ... Everyone 's gone except us . And animals , there are still animals . So what 's so different about us ? And why 's Sarah Jane gone ? If anyone round here 's different , I reckon it 's her . Yeah ... Maybe they just want us . Or they DON 'T want us . Hold on ... Why are aliens more likely to single US out more than anyone else ? Durr ! Cos we know Sarah Jane . Thinking isn 't getting us anywhere , we 're just going round in a big circle . Exactly , we need logic , we need brains , we ... We need Luke ! How long will it take to get to Oxford ? No ! We 're staying put ! If he 's around , he 'll come down to us . But what if he 's up in the quad thinking , " Maybe if I stay put they 'll come up to me ? " What if he 's not there at all ? What if it 's just the two of us left in the whole wide world ? Like ... Adam and Eve . Yeah . No ! There 's got to be someone else . There 's got to be ! All right . Where do we start ? Back to the attic . If anything 's happens , it 's going to happen there . If anything ever happens again . Hello ? It 's probably just a cat or something . HINGES SQUEAK Come on ! Where 'd it go ? There ! Stop ! Oi ! Come on ! One second ! But this is stealing ! Yeah ? We 'll bring them back ! Always wanted a go with that . Why do you get the cool bike ? This one 's pink ! Oh , does it matter ? We 've got to find out who it is ! There ! It was a kid ! He 's gone . Hello ? Hello ? ! Hey ! Come on ! Please stop . We 're not going to hurt you ! He 's through there ! Ah , it 's locked ! SONIC LIPSTICK ZAPS Hello ? Don 't be afraid . You 're the only other person we 've seen . Hello ? Hello . What do you want ? Get away from me ! How did you get in here ? Stay away ! It 's OK , we 're not going to hurt you ! We are so glad to see you ! Oh , sorry , yeah , I know , girl in your bedroom . Where 's everybody gone ? Did you do this ? Why did you follow me ? Let 's all calm down ! I 'm Rani , this is Clyde . Gavin . I 'll go make us a cup of tea , yeah ? I don 't blame you , really , being scared . I 'm not scared . Ah , your mum and dad . They just disappeared ? They 're my aunt and uncle . My mum died years ago . Never knew my dad , he ran off when I was little . You and me both , mate . Lynne , my aunt , she just vanished . I knocked all the doors , nothing there , so I went into town . Exactly what we did . You ... got any better biscuits ? How did you get in here ? I locked the door . Long story . Can you keep a secret ? Yeah . Sonic lipstick . It 's alien technology . You 're aliens ! What ? Rani ! No ! But we 've met aliens , fought aliens . Why are you telling him this ? Remember rule number one ! Gavin has got a right to know . Well , he needs to know , if anything happens to us . Don 't wind me up ! It 's true . Is it any weirder than what happened today ? Aliens took everybody ? That 's impossible . This is mad ! But it 's happened . And there 's just the three of us left , and we have got to work out why . My aunt said there 's no such thing as aliens . Your aunt likes rubbish biscuits . So , aliens . Have you ever met any , seen any ? What , me ? No ! What are you talking about ? There must be a reason why there 's only three of us left . Now you think I 'm an alien ? No , you 're weird , this is like some stupid kids ' game we 're playing . I 'm not stupid , there are no aliens ! HORNS BLAST OUTSIDE What 's that ? Trumpets ? What 's this now ? Is that like a generator ? Could be a signal . That trumpet noise , getting our attention . Could be anything . It could be a stardrive powering down . That alien energy source Mr Smith picked up ! Yeah ! No surrounding noise , but it comes through clear . Gavin , have you ever heard anything like this before ? Gavin ? Where 's he gone ? We 're idiots ! He must be terrified . The bike 's gone ! HORNS BLAST AGAIN It 's coming from the high street . Right , let 's take a look ! Oi , that 's my bike ! Does it matter ? RHYTHMIC CLUMPING We 've lost it and we 've lost Gavin . Weird alien noise , terrified kid and what do we do ? Run to the window and start talking all Star Trek . We must have looked really normal . Is Gavin normal , though ? What do you mean ? Well , this morning , when I was alone , I thought I was the only one left , it was horrible . If I 'd seen anyone else , even if it was Chris Moyles , I would have run towards them , not away , like Gavin did . Wouldn 't you ? Yeah . But when you were that age , sixth-form kids looked big and scary . I 'm not big and scary . And that flat , apart from one photo , was there anything that said a kid lives here ? No kids ' DVDs lying around , no photos of them with him . And his room , it was like a cell . No computer games or anything . Isn 't that weird ? Then we should feel sorry for him , not start judging him ! He lives a really rubbish life , and what 's our first reaction ? " Oh , maybe he 's an alien . " What are we ? Are we sure he isn 't ? No ! I don 't know and neither do you , just leave it ! Oh , so you 're in charge ? Yeah , I think I probably should be . I 've known Sarah Jane longer than you , I 've got more experience . What , so it 's like the army now ? We 've all got ranks and you 're second in command , sir ? Look , we need a plan of action ! Right , from now on , if we get split up , meet back here , yeah ? What , your headquarters , sir ? Yes , sir ( ! ) Ah , look at me , honest Injun . Never would have done that before Sarah Jane . Mmm-hmm . OK , I 'm sorry . Biggest crisis ever and it 's just us . Not the time traveller , not the boy genius , not the supercomputer or the mega-dog . Us . Hey ! We are vital team members . What , the two kids with no reason to be there ? The hangers-on ? We 're both just really nosey , that 's how we got into Sarah Jane 's life . She warned us off , gave us the choice to go back and forget it all . Maybe she was right . Maybe today 's the day it all comes back to bite us on the bum . Do you think that if it wasn 't for Sarah Jane and our thing that we 'd have been mates ? I dunno . Maybe . Maybe not . It 's not the usual way to grow up , though , is it ? Fighting aliens . Defending the Earth . Don 't see much of my old gang any more . They 're like , " I met this hottie in Whispers in Acton . " What am I supposed to say ? " I was fighting the Pied Piper of Hamelin " ? I love it , though . Yeah . With Sarah Jane , half the time I 'm terrified and the other half , I 'm really happy . Well , I 'm leaning towards terrified right now . None of this makes sense . If they 're clever enough , if they 're powerful enough to magic ... OK , teleport away , everybody ... If that is what they 've done . Let 's say it is . Let 's say they 've got rid of everyone so they can invade , take over Earth for themselves . Then where are they ? And why haven 't they come to get us ? Don 't tempt fate . I 'm not like Sarah Jane , I believe in fate . What if ... .. aliens have decided to start the human race again , just beginning with you and me ? Clyde , seriously , shut up . What is that ? MOBILE PHONE BEEPS It 's on here too . Yeah , and mine ! CLUMPING AND GURGLING There it is again ! Yeah , and a lot closer ! Clyde ! It 's on every screen . What does it mean ? It 's got to be something to do with that noise . GURGLING AND CLUMPING CONTINUES It 's definitely coming from up there somewhere . Gavin ? Gavin ! Gavin , is that you ? ! No ! Don 't , please . Clyde , there 's this big robot thing ! Yeah I saw it , big and yellow . Big and red ! And how are we supposed to deal with two big robots ? Run ! Robots can clear everybody out of the whole world , except for the three of us . And now they 've come looking for us ! Come on , come on ! The whole thing now makes even less sense than it did before there were any robots !

 Subs created by : David Coleman . ♪ Two ... two , three ... [ whirring ] [ whooshing ] [ music ] [ Bender laughing ] [ whooping ] Remember this place , Leela ? Yep . The moon . It 's been here for quite a while . Yeah , but it 's also where we came on our very first delivery together ! Oh , right . Man , we sure used to try harder back then . [ jazzy music playing ] Get your likeness in the form of a balloon sculpture ! A cherished family keepsake for hours to come ! One Leela , please . And , uh , use your finest balloons . Wow , you 're good . Five years of art school . [ Chuckles ] [ sobs ] [ pained grunt ] - Want a corndog ? - Sure . Then your mom should have bought you one . [ laughs ] [ munching ] - Ooh , fancy ! - RIDE OPERATOR : Hold tight ! The Mecha-Hexadecapus is about to flail erratically into action ! [ all gasping , yelling ] Whoa ... Oh , yeah ... Oh ... You know , I 'm feeling a little ... [ vomits ] [ Leela screams ] Leela ! [ air whooshing ] [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ sobbing ] Poor Leela ! I never even told her I loved her ! What ? ! You told her , like , a 140 times ! Yeah , but she paid very little attention to me . Oh , Bender ! I always thought me and her would grow old together ! [ imitates buzzer ] You gotta live in the moment , baby ! And in this moment , Leela 's dead . [ door opens ] Sir , we have some good news and some bad news . The good news is , we found your stuffed animal . - What 's the bad news ? - Your wife is dead . - She wasn 't my wife ! - Oh ! Then there is no bad news . [ sobbing ] [ gasps ] [ groaning , gasping ] Leela ! You 're alive ! [ grunts ] She gave her life to save mine . [ knocking on door ] FRY : Bender , can I come in and talk ? I 'm kinda busy . Seeing Leela fly off the Hexadecapus and crash through the moon dome and survive inside a stuffed animal by breathing a balloon was a dose of reality . [ sing-songy ] : Come in ... All this time , I 've been wondering if I can spend my life with her . But what I realize now is , I can 't spend my life without her . So , tomorrow , I 'm asking her to marry me . Uh-huh . Good talk . We 're done here . [ sniffles ] My little meatbag 's growing up . Computer , Jamaican Joy Juice , hot ! [ slurping ] G. N. , E. ! Behold the Time Button ! A pocket-sized device that sends the entire universe ten seconds into the past ! I will now demonstrate . [ trills , whooshes ] Joy Juice , hot . Pretty cool , eh ? I 'm over here where I was ten seconds ago . Something 's cool ? Show it to us ! Whuh ? Oh , right . You were outside the button ball , so you don 't remember a thing I said . Let 's try again , but this time , everyone cram into my time shelter . [ all murmur with awe ] Ooh , nice ! It 's coated with antichroniton-resistant grout to shield you from the effects of the button . Come on . Get in . Hurry up . [ electrical buzzing ] Friends , I found a ten dollars ! Ten dollars , you say ? Let me see . It fell off a man . The man got into a taxi , but the money did not . Friends , I found a ten dollars ! You found some money ? Show me . [ groans ] Say , check out the money I found . It fell off a chump ! [ Laughs ] [ applause ] Hey , Professor , couldn 't you go back in time as far as you want by pressing the button over and over ? Certainly not ! Each time the button sends you back ten seconds , it takes ten seconds to recharge . [ beeps ] There , it 's recharged . [ groans ] - Again , again ! - Uh , question ? What if you had a special moment that you wished could go on forever ? Could the Time Button make it last as long as you wanted ? Hell , no ! This button is for scientific use only . [ beeps ] [ groans ] Uh , yes , I 'd like an engagement diamond , please ? You come to the right joint , ace . I 'll take ... this one . Classy choice , chief . She 'll crap her pants . [ grunting ] That 'll be five bills . Hey , give me back my stones ! Hello , stranger . This is my first time here . - Do you sell diamonds ? - You come to the right joint , ace . [ both chuckle ] I guess what I 'm saying is , the next time you almost die , I want it to be as my wife . [ gasps ] The clam , Elzar . Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am ! [ sniffles ] Fry ... ? Wow ... Leela , my love ... will you ... ? [ screaming ] I 'll have what she 's having . [ screaming ] Oh , God ! I ruined everything ! I blew my one chance to ... Hey , wait a second ! Clam , bam , thank you , ma 'am ! [ sniffles ] Fry ... ? Wait ! Allow me . Leela , my love , will you marry me ? Oh , my gosh ! This is all so sudden ... - after 13 years . - Don 't answer yet ! I want this to be a special moment , so I rented the roof garden on top of the tallest building in New New York . - The Vampire State Building ? - Uh huh . If your answer 's yes , be there tonight at 6 : 30 , half hour before sunset . And if my answer 's no ? Then just don 't show up . I 'll get the message . [ coughs ] Big night , eh , Mr. Fry ? The biggest , Janös . Check this out . What is that ? Some kind of time button ? Exactly . If she says yes , I 'll use it to make the sunset last as long as we want . Strange things happen when the shadows lengthen . WOMAN [ over P.A. ] : Janitor to the 237th floor men 's room . Six o 'clock . She 'll be here in half an hour . [ beeps ] 6 : 30 ? Maybe she 's stuck in slow traffic . I know she 'll come . I know it . I really thought she was gonna come . [ sniffles ] I traveled a thousand years forward in time , but without Leela , I have no future . [ grunts ] This is the end . [ Sniffles ] Good-bye , my love . [ grunts ] Leela ? ! Hey ! It 's only 6 : 25 ! So why does my watch say 7 : 03 ? ! Of course ! My watch is fast because it kept running every time I hit the button ! So Leela 's actually on time ! Hi , Leela ! Fry ! It 's okay , I 'm gonna die happy ! No , wait ! I 'll go back ten seconds till when I was on the roof ! Rats . Guess I was falling for more than ten seconds . Hi , Leela ! Fry ! Everything 's cool ! Wait a second . There 's no possible way out of this situation ! Help , help ... ! Fry ! I 'm stuck in a loop ! This isn 't the moment I wanted to last forever ! Careful . This is the most valuable thing we 've ever delivered . Oop ! [ Guttural scream ] - Careful . This is the most ... - Quickly ! Into the time shelter ! [ each grunts as they enter ] Someone stole the Time Button , and they 're pressing it every ten seconds ! The universe is caught in a time loop ! Then let 's go out and stop them ! Are you mad ? ! Because that would make two of us . Ugh ! You 're right . We 'd never get anywhere . We 'd just keep jumping back to where we started . Also , we 'd die horribly ! You see , we 're shielded in here . So if we leave the time shelter and the button gets pressed less than ten seconds later , the antichronitons wouldn 't know where to send us back to ! We 'd be shredded across the time-space continuum like human coleslaw ! Yum ! Observe . Aw ... Listen , I know who stole the button . I wasn 't gonna tell , because I don 't like being helpful . But I do like ratting people out , so ... - it was Fry ! - [ all gasp ] He took it to the Vampire State Building . We 've got to get to him . But how ? We can 't leave the time shelter . Hooray ! I 'm trapped in a tiny fun room with friends ! [ bird screeching ] [ bird screeching ] Man , falling from a great height an infinite number of times can be stressful . At least I have Leela 's comforting scream to look forward to . Fry ! [ yawns ] [ snoring ] - LEELA : Fry ! - Whuh ? [ screams ] [ bird screeching ] PROFESSOR : Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry , stop ! Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry hurry , hurry , hurry ... ♪ My boyfriend gave me a diamond ... - Hurry , hurry , hurry ... - Oh ! Fry ! We 're here to rescue you ! [ snores , gasps ] Professor ? Oops . [ gasps , whimpers ] Fry ! Professor ? [ Fry screaming ] [ music ] He 's ... he 's dead . It does look that way . My poor sweet puddle ! [ gasps ] The button ! I can still save him ! No , don 't ! You 'll shred me into a zillion ... It worked ! HERMES : But you killed the Professor ! Yeah , but it worked ! [ gasps , grunts ] I died . I 'm dead ! I 'm gonna die ! Come on , come on . Fry , what 's happening ? Did you fall off the building ? Actually , that 's kind of a funny story ... He sure has a lot of blood for a skinny guy . [ bird screeching ] And I didn 't want to go on living without you , so I jumped , and , well ... Oh ... That 's so sweet , Fry . [ sighs ] You know those dreams where you 're falling , and right before you hit the ground you wake up ? Those are great . If only there were a way to make Fry land softly , this would all be over . Ooh , I know ! My airbag ! Leela ! I 'm coming to save the day ! Hang on , Fry ! You 're just one death away from being saved ! And then we can be marry me ? Okay , I 'm gonna run out there . Then , you guys form a human bus and crash into me at 40 miles an hour . Ready ? Go ! [ panting ] [ grunts ] We did it ! [ whoops ] [ cheering ] Wh-What happened ? Did I break the button ? I think you broke the universe . Everything but us is frozen . What are we gonna do ? First , I 'm gonna get back these earrings I loaned Amy three years ago . After that , I don 't know . This is surreal . Whatever we want is ours for the taking . [ echoing ] : Hello ? Anyone ? [ hollow knocking ] I guess it 's just us for all eternity . Listen , Leela , I 'm not sure what kind of life we can make together in this frozen time-sicle , but if it 's not too weird ... will you still marry me ? I would marry you even if you weren 't the last man on Earth . - [ gasps ] - [ gasps ] - What was that ? - I don 't know ... but I 'm scared . Well , maybe we just need some rest . We can get married in the morning . Except there won 't be morning . We can worry about that in the morning . [ grunting ] [ cracking ] Do I , Philip J. Fry , take you , Turanga Leela , to be my lawful wedded wife ? You do . Do I , Turanga Leela , take you , Philip J. Fry , to be my lawful wedded husband ? Uh ... yes ? Absolutely . [ urgent grunting ] There it is again ! Leave my wife alone , you glimmer ! It 's okay , Fry . If it keeps bugging us , we 'll either kill it or adopt it . Meanwhile , what do you say we get started on a very , very , very long honeymoon ? [ both grunting with effort ] I think it 's about time we drank the champagne Janös poured all those years ago . May I read the toast I was going to make ? Go for it . I 'm in no rush , after walking up 240 flights of steps . And across those oceans . " To us . " If I could make one moment last forever , this is the one I would choose . " I 'm glad you did . It was a good life . Kind of lonely , though ? Maybe ? I was never lonely . Not even for a minute . I guess we 'll never figure out what that glimmer is . Nope . Pretty , though . Hey , hey , wait ... it 's doing something ! [ groans ] I 'll protect you . Hi ... yow ! Professor ? ! - You 're alive ? ! - Yes , it 's me . Boy , did somebody hit you two with an old-and-ugly-stick . I thought I killed you with the Time Button . I thought so , too , at first . But it seems I was simply rotated into an orthogonal time that runs at right angles to this one . I 've been tunneling for decades , searching every instant from yesterday to tomorrow . We 've been right now the whole time . I wasn 't looking for you , I was looking for the Time Button . [ grunts ] Oh ! I landed on it and time froze . I tried to fix it once , but then I got mad and hit it some more . I guess it 's good we didn 't have children . Oh , give me that , you senile old idiot ! Oh , let me see ... that goes there ... lefty loosey , righty tighty , and ... fixed ! What ? ! I could 've fixed it that easily ? You ? [ giddy laughter ] Okay . I 've modded the device to release a single huge antichroniton blast . It should rip us out of stasis , back to the instant before I conceived of the Time Button . You mean we 'll all get to live our lives over again ? Oh , my , yes . Even that nasty robot , what 's-his-name . Of course , we won 't remember anything that 's happened . What do you say ? Want to go around again ? I do .

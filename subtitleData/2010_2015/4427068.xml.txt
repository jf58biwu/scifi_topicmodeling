 Year 1991 . [ Kang Dong Won ] [ Ko Su ] Don 't take it off , even if it is stifling . Mm ? Only when you wash you face , close your eyes tight , and we will remove it . Mommy will wash you quickly and then put it back on . Even while you 're sleeping . And when you 're eating . I will do everything for you . Why ? That way . You 'll heal sooner . But I 'm not sick ... Hey , you cunt ! Does food even go down your throat ? Huh ? You . Do you think you are done with me when you just take off and find a new life ? So cruel , you are so cruel ! You must 've already found a new husband too , then . Aigoo . Let 's just eat first . Ah , so wet .. damn . Do you think he will become a human just because you covered his eyes ? Crazy bitch . You little bastard . You don 't even greet your father when he has just arrived ! I wonder if ripping out his eyes would fix him . Ah , geez . Now you 're trying to act like his mother . How can you treat your husband like that ? I get sick just watching you two . No ! What do you mean by ' no ' ? It 's hard , right ? Right ? Mommy , too , can no longer handle this ... So let 's just .. stop living . Okay ? Why are even my parents trying to kill me ? 2010 It 's not my fault that I was born like this . The fact that I am different from others , you people will never understand . I , too , do not wish to mingle amongst you .

It 's room 1407 . Psychic . Hyungnim ! Hyung ! Eat a lot . Hey ! One of you in this group hasn 't paid yet ! Who is it ? Wow , with all of the effort he is putting forth ...

For someone who got messed up this bad , your healing rate is quite fast , the nurses are saying . Really ? Oooh . Looks like you 're gonna get married . Hyung , do you know that saying ? They say that in a man 's life , there are 3 turning points . So . You 've just passed the first point . Then you have two more left . Really ? There are two more times ? Ah , hold on . So think carefully . Have you ever been sick enough to die when you were young ? Almost starved to death after losing all of your money ? Did anything like that happen ? Oh , that time Hyungnim . Thomas . You let him borrow some money , but he just took off . I just gave it to him . Ay , No , that is a point . At that time , you didn 't have any money so you lived for a month eating ramen .

How come you 're the only one who is lucid ? Don 't know .. Hyungnim , are you a ghost ? What ? You can 't touch ghosts , right ? Is he an evil spirit ? Stop talking nonsense . Let 's take this to the police . Oh ! Catch him ! What the ... Go out the back ! Quickly ! Hurry ! Is there no way down ? I know . This way . Jump . The tape ! Hyungnim ! Hand it over . Why are they doing that ? What about Hyungnim ? You do it with your eyes . What do you do , you bastard ? Just what .. No , I don 't need to know . Revive my boss . Why ? You can 't revive a dead person ? Then why did you kill him ? What you said is right . What ? I can control people I can see . What are you ? Basta ... Answer me . What are you ? I don 't know . You son of an evil spirit . I 'm an evil spirit ? You should disappear . It 's too strange that you 're the only one that it doesn 't work on . Right ? Wait wait wait calm down . Wait . Go well . Evil spirit . Hey , you 're the one that always throws around the trash here right ? I will leave on my daily routine . Look here ... What do you think you are doing ? I am Representative Im from Utopia . If you look at this tape , you 'll know everything . Really I can 't take responsibility if you take that off of him . Stop worrying . Go over here . Have some coffee . Come over here . No . It 's okay . You 're saying that he can confuse people with his eyes ? Yes . The company people So he confused the company workers and made them go berserk . Yes . Yes , but two of them are from a different company . Okay , so that 's how your president died ... But you don 't trust the eye-guy right ? Hey young man , Are you perhaps on drugs ? You know Like Heroine , or marijuana or even glue . No . You don 't smell like you 're drunk . You saw the CCTV ( security video ) right ? I did see the CCTV . You were making quite a racket . Show me your arm . It 's clean . That What does your school record look like ? Dae Sung Middle ... . You don 't believe me right ? Who says that I don 't believe you ? This is what the investigators do . No no .. This is all just a part of the investigation process . Drink the coffee . There are so many crazy bastards . What Utopia ? What is this world turning into ? Hey ! Is he breathing ? Take it off quickly . Take it off ! I think there is something weird in the CCTV . Are you crazy ? That guy is crazy ! I caught him ... The police station ... That bastard is finished . No no , don 't come . It 's okay . I don 't know when I 'll be finished here . Then pack some soondae . But I I don 't know why I did feel nervous . Come out , you bastard ! You can 't control a baby either ? Let 's stop this now , bastard . Whose fault do you think it is that it 's come this far ? What ? This bastard ... My boss and these people who are here . They 're all like this because of you . Why is that any of your concern ? Do your parents know ? Do they know you 're going around doing this ? Who are you to kill people ? Who are you to control people ? Who are you to do whatever you want to do ? Then what are you ? I 'm Utopia 's representative Im , you son of a bitch ! No ! Bong Soon ! Bong Soon ! Bong Soon ! How , my baby ! It 's okay . It would have been better if you had stayed still . Representative Im . Ahjumma . Yes ? Please wrap the soondae . Yes . Huh ? Isn 't this Hyungnim ? How much is it ? $ 4 . Let 's go quickly . Give me that . Come quickly ! Bye ! Criminal number 8 , Im Kyu Nam , is currently on the run ... Where are you going ? I 'm going to play , why ? You 're going to play ? Hyungnim . So what are you going to do now ? What else can I do ? I have to catch him ! Hyung , you pay taxes , don 't you ? Do you know why you pay your taxes ? You do it because you 're asking someone else to take care of these types of problems . Why do you keep stepping forward when you should be leaving this to the salaried public servants ? It must be my fate . You sure like your fate . Hey , Im Kyu Nam ! you should live more smartly . Why do you keep trying to mess up your already messed up life ? Ali , you know . And so I mean , why did I last time ... I understand brother 's heart . But doing things this way . It 's not something that can be handled by yourself . Turn yourself in . Let 's let the police catch him . That bastard can 't be caught by the police . If not the police , then the investigators . If not them , then fuck there are so many more people out there than you ! It 's fine . This is the best thing to do . For guys like us . This is our fate . At this rate , you 'll be caught before we catch that guy . But still , this is the only option right now . Didn 't president say that ? Life is about eating and staying alive . If we eat and live , we 'll meet him again . Where are we going ? To where he 's eating and living . Well , after work shall we go eat eel or something ? The smell gets into my clothes . I 'll wash your clothes . Welcome . How much money did you need ? I 'm looking for a person . If you 're looking for someone , you should go to a place that does that sort of thing . We lend money here . That guy may not be a person . Would you like some sugar ? Yes , two spoons . What do you mean he 's not a person ? What does that mean ? He 's a guy who goes around to places like this , stealing money . He speaks Korean well . That 's right . Guys who steal aren 't people . You do know well but what is the reason for your coming here ? Does that work ? What does ? CCTV Of course . Do you think I put that there just for show ? Did you perhaps record anything strange ? Or you are missing something in your records ... You know , like you take your pants off at night But you feel some kind of gut feeling ... What is this ? This oppa is very funny . You must take off your pants a lot . President , it 's not that . You must know that while working in this business , you could have a hatred for cops ... You bastards , really . Miss Lee , can you see how hard I work ? These guys come in off the street and try to show me . My younger brother is a cop . Get out quickly , before I call the police . If you verify it by watching the CCTV . And so ? What are you gonna do by watching the CCTV ? Get out . Get out . Contact us if you find anything . Come again ! You bastards . Can you see ? Yup . Basically . But will this work ? You said he did it with his eyes . It should be good if we don 't see him right ? Or not . Maybe he has to see us for it to work . In any case , we have to try . Okay , so please concentrate on this . With one hit of this , he will be blind even during the day . How is it ? Is it okay ? We can 't return it to the police . That 's why I experimented with it . Boba . I told you I 'm not done with that yet . Why do you keep touching it ? Did you try shooting it ? I have to test it now . Boba . Hasta la vista . Baby . Who are you ? We came from Seoul . What 's the problem ? It 's been 20 years since he 's been here . Do you think we can find anything here ? There 's nothing . This ahjumma doesn 't even know what her child looks like Officer Choi ! Yes . This is really hard . You 're exhausted , right ? Aigoo .. Where is he hiding ? Hyung . After you find that bastard , what are you going to do after that ? Although you 're not affected by him . Other people are . This isn 't a fight just between you and him . The bigger problem is fighting against all the people he controls . In any case , there are 3 of us . That bastard is by himself . What can he do by himself ? I don 't know . In any case , let 's finish this . And then have a nice relaxing drink . At Mool Mang Cho . What ? Mool Mang Cho ? Where is that ? A beer bar at the end of Third Street . When did you find out about that place ? Okay . Let 's have a relaxing drink there . I 'll treat . I don 't drink alcohol ! You 're telling me to drink cider again ? Was that guy looking for us too ? Hey ! Boba ! Come to your senses , you bastard . Come to your senses ! This won 't do . Hey , Boba ! Where is that bastard ? I don 't see him . Do you see him ? Hyung , where are you going ? Put your helmet on . What are you going to do ? Stay here . You 're really not dead . I thought you were dead . But what 's the use in going through all the effort of looking for me ? What will you do ? But that .. is useless . You 're only making things worse . It 's something that should have happened without much fuss . But because of you , things have come to this . Your company 's president died because of you ! Do you know that ? Right now , these people don 't know what they are doing . They won 't remember . Because of you , many people are losing things . And could die . And have died . What about it ? What do you think if all of these people here were to die ? Who will they blame ? You ? Me ? Hey crazy bastard ! All . You . It 's all your doing . Really ? Then I 'll try it one time . Don 't do that . STOP THAT ! Who is going to win ? Will it be me who has so many people that will fight . Or will it be you who has to fight so many people ? But you .. Do you really know who you 're fighting ? Stop mumbling from your hiding spot . Come out right now ! What happened here ? Did you see anything ? Shoot . Did we hit him ? You 're the one who did the shooting . Shouldn 't you know ? Well done . Hey ! Take the car and go catch him . Do you understand ? I 'll shoot from here . He 's coming . Boba ! I told them to stay there Ali ! Boba ! Boba ! Boba ! Stay still . They aren 't dead yet . Hanging kills fairly quickly ... What do you want me to do ? What ? What do you want ? I don 't want anything . Then . Let 's stop . Who are you to decide that ? After making this matter get to this point you want me to ... Stop . That doesn 't even make any sense . What ? Am I wrong ? Should we ask your friends ? Boba , Ali , are you okay ? Come to your senses . Wait .. Why are you caught , hyung ? Hyung is alright . Don 't worry about me . Okay ? Nothing bad will happen . I 'm alright I 'm not okay . [ Says something in Ghana language .. ] Don 't cry Boba .. How embarrassing ! Stop joking around ! Let us down , you bastard ! Do you still think I 'm joking around ? You still don 't understand this situation ? Because of you , I ... damn ! You . shouldn 't have met me from the start . Also the same goes with your friends . And the president . And you .. should not have met anyone at all . Stop with the nonsense and let us down . My friends have nothing to do with this . What do you mean they have nothing to do with this ? You 're the reason why they 're going to die ! And you . You 're going to die because you met me . Being different from other people ... it 's hard . Right ? You .. had an eventful life . Stop . Please , stop ! I beg you ! Getting your loved ones taken .. is a bad feeling . No ! You 've suffered a lot in the meantime . Representative Im . Wake up . The weather is so ... shit .. Where is Young Sook ? There are so many people . Hey . Do you like me ? Stop talking nonsense and tell me where Young Sook is . I told you they 're all dying because of you . Did you kill Young Sook ? Are you a person ? Go with Young Sook , you bastard . What ? No no . No . If it weren 't for me , you wouldn 't have been anything . You would have just lived as representative Im . Right ? ... Also , if it weren 't for you , I wouldn 't have done all this . If you want to let her live . You should have died . Why did you continue to struggle to live ? I don 't need anything now . I won 't die until I kill you . I 'll kill you and live till I die . And save as many as you have killed . I finally understand why my powers won 't work on you . But I only wanted to live too ! Hey , you bastard . What 's your name ? That 's right . Who will know me and remember me ? If we had met under different circumstances , would we have been friends ? Could we .. have been ? I could have gone by myself to dad . I will definitely pass the driver 's test this time so let 's be patient . Wait a moment . Hey , look over there .

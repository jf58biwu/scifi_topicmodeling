 490,000 babies will be born today . ( chuckles ) Each of them unique . And each one of them a link in the greater human chain . ( men speaking Arabic ) And the moment their umbilical cord is severed they will become an individual with their own hopes , dreams and desires . But , in fact , each one of us is actually made up of a dozen systems ... I am lost . I 'm a tourist . Central Park ? Two blocks this way . - Okay , thank you , thank you . - Oh , you 're welcome . - Thank you , xie xie , xie xie , thank you . - No problem . ... which , in turn , comprise 60 trillion cells , and those cells house countless proteins , DNA , organelles . What appears to be an individual is actually a network . Excuse me . You dropped this . Thank you so much . You 're welcome . ( sighs ) Each one of us is , in fact , a living , breathing community , but it doesn 't stop there . Why would it ? ( woman speaking French over P.A. ) Every individual hope you harbor , every dream you retain , every desire you fulfill has an impact far greater than you can imagine . At least that 's how it looks from where I 'm sitting . MARTIN : Jake , come on . Lunch is almost here . Let 's make some room . Great , perfect . Okay , Jake , just the way you like it . Sesame bagel quartered , not toasted . This is exactly what I 'm talking about , what the evaluation committee needs to see today- - you two connecting . It paints a picture . They can 't make an assessment of Jake 's situation unless they see his bond with you firsthand . I think the last ten years was proof enough , but whatever . Okay , come on , buddy , let 's get some food in you , okay ? Come on . Jake , come on . Look , I know this hasn 't been easy , but we 're all on the same side here . Everyone wants what 's best for Jake . No one wants that more than me . Today is the first in a series of evals to decide who gets custody of Jake . They 're gonna run him through a series of assessments . - Assessments ? - PEP-3 . It determines his developmental functioning- - imitation , perception , fine motor skills . Jake 's improving , but we both know he 's more focused when you 're there . And these photos you put together for the evaluation- - it 's icing . Add it to your friends ' testimonials , the things Jake 's aunt sent over . It all goes to strengthen ... Abigail sent something to Jake ? A box- - I haven 't opened it yet , if ... Jake 's been in board and care for less than a week . How 'd she know he was there ? I just assumed you told her . No . When Jake 's mother died , her sister Abigail tried to take him from me . ( glass shatters ) - Oh , here , let me . - It 's all right . I got it . I got it . Buddy , it 's all right . Accidents happen , okay ? 5 : 00 , I 'll be there . Sweetheart , you got to go . MARTIN : Sort of looked like this . Numbers . Numbers- - I 'm starting to understand them . And now patterns ? Here . What was the medium ? ( chuckles ) Maple syrup and sugar packets . Of course . Please , tell me that I am so desperate to have a conversation with my son to ... to help stop the pain that I 'm starting to see signs where there aren 't any . Why would you want me to tell you that ? Because today the best thing for Jake is for me to just be his dad . ( sighs ) The best thing for Jake is for you to follow his road map . Look at this . ( call to prayer ) ( tires screech ) ( tires screech ) Mathematicians have studied art through the lens of geometry since the first line was drawn on a cave wall . So you 're saying that Jake 's pattern is actually a number . He 's just playing with the format . See , the circles have 22 points . It 's a riff on a centered heptagonal number . Twenty-two . The number that Jake wants to convey to you is 22 . Well , why doesn 't he just write it down like before ? Why does he have to draw it ? That seen to be remains . Remains to be seen . This is good . Jake 's progressing . Normally I 'd be thrilled , but we were finally starting to communicate , and ... now he wants to change the language . Yes , but he 's got your attention . Maybe the old language couldn 't put across what he needed to get . Tea ? Are you feeling okay ? Never better . ( sighs ) Tell me you grew a pair and talked to her . Okay , make me proud . 8 : 00- - I want you on that train talking to that girl . ♪ But I 'm better now , I 'm strong ♪ ♪ Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 've been gone a while ♪ ♪ But I 'm back for good ♪ ♪ I was trying to live a life that I misunderstood ♪ ♪ I couldn 't seem to stay away from the darker things ... ♪ ( panting ) ( car horns honking ) Not today . Hey ! Hey ! Watch out , watch out , watch out ! Sorry . Sorry , sir . Excuse me . The guy just stole my computer . There . Stop that guy ! Please ! Sorry . Damn it . Sorry about that . The guy just stole my computer . Jake 's pattern . Sit still and shut up . This will be over in five stops . ( phone rings ) Don 't even think about it . Please , I 'm late for an appointment for my son . This is Martin Bohm . Please leave a message at the tone . The eval 's about to start . ( whispering ) : I 'm tap-dancing as fast as I can . Trying to stall , but you said you 'd be here . Where are you ? Please , you don 't understand . All I have to be today is on time . I 'm not trying to be a hero . Trust me . But I have to believe that nobody 's supposed to die today , so please , at the next stop , let 's just get off the bus , and I swear I won 't say a word . Is that man part of this ? Shut up . One down , four to go . The works . Do you remember ? So the concert happens . Afterwards , we go backstage . Big security guard sitting there right in front . Show him the passes , say , " Excuse me , please . " He stops us , says , I 'm sorry . You can 't go there . " Daddy ! You came ! ( chuckles ) You 're late . Couldn 't come empty-handed , could I ? I 'm gonna open this and find pictures of someone else 's vacation , aren 't I ? I taught you how to scrub one of these when you were six . How about today we keep it legit ? Wember . Didn 't think you 'd make it . Yeah , I got held up on the cross-town bus . So , you and Mandy 's mom went all out . Oh , place is a dump . Miranda loves it . ( both chuckle ) I 've been bringing her since she was three for Chinese New Year 's . You used to cover your eyes . And peek through my fingers at the Chinese dragon . ( all laugh ) Honey ? Well , your mother and I got you something . A new car ? ! ( chuckles ) Oh , it 's too much . ( chuckles ) Guys , I got a new car ! Only the best for our girl , right ? You took the words right out of my mouth . What 's going on ? Their son , Gabriel Wilmington , acute myeloid leukemia . He needs a bone marrow donor quickly . And he 's adopted . Birth parents ? I want you on the phone with every donor coordinator on our list . We 'll need an ethnic match , so start on the coasts . I hope you have no place to be . No place to be . I thank you . You know , it 's one of those situations ... I 'm in need of some medical attention . Excuse me . I , uh , slipped in the shower . I hit my head . ER 's on the ground floor . They 'll send me right back up here , get an MRI . So ... why don 't we just skip the middleman ? - It happened again , didn 't it , Dad ? - It 's happening now . I want you in front of a neurologist . Dr. Bennet owes me a favor . Imagine it , Maggie , we can map the brain event in progress . This could be the key to the next numbers in the sequence . - Yes , hi . This is Maggie ... - Hang up . I found another one , a boy . Dad , no . Jake Bohm . He 's unlike anything you 've ever seen . Cognitively , intuitively advanced . Now , if we start to study right today ... Stop it ! Dad , you 're sick . Let me help you . If you want to help , get me to a scanner . I 've been down this rabbit hole before , and you know what 's there ? Rabbits . But it 's different this time , Maggie . You know , they don 't even know I 've found the boy . What is it gonna take to get through to you ? The last time you did this , you lost everything . - They took it from me ! - No , you imploded , and you dragged me down right along with you . So tell me , how is it going to be different this time , hmm ? Please , talk to Dr. Bennet . You 're seeing things that just aren 't there . No . No . I 'm seeing clearly for the first time in years . ( gasping ) ( groans ) ( groans ) Please , my son 's waiting for me . Shut up ! You said this would be over in five stops . Is that when he 's getting off the bus ? I 'll do it . I 'll shoot you . Then go ahead . Because , if you don 't start answering my questions , I 'm going to do more than talk . Ten years ago , that man walked into El Mozole , my village . It was just after breakfast . My mother was hanging laundry . The bullets came first . Our neighbor , a school teacher ... I watched her head explode . And I hid under my bed , and I listened to my mother beg for their lives . But my father ... they took my father and my brother . He was only five years old . That man killed my family . Today I balance the scales . If the examiner would be willing to come back tomorrow ... - Jake , he 's just having an off day . - Come on , Clea . We both know tomorrow wouldn 't be any different . Jake 's nonresponsive . He has difficulty following basic instruction . He can ; he chooses not to . There 's a difference . - If his father had been here ... - Look , I get it . You 're pulling for the dad . We all do . But on paper , this one is a mess . Jake 's repeatedly run away while in his father 's care . The authorities had to be called on multiple occasions . The truth is Mr. Bohm was part of the evaluation , just not the way you wanted him to be . I 'm sorry , Clea , but from where I 'm standing , you 're betting on the wrong horse . ( screaming , gasping ) ( gasping ) Even if everything that you told me is true , killing him 's not gonna bring back your family . An eye for an eye . What about you ? Why do you care ? You don 't even know me . I can 't ... I won 't believe that I 'm supposed to just sit here and let this happen . There are some moments that define our lives . This is one of them . I was ten time zones away , two packs in , staring down a deadline , when the first plane hit the North Tower . My wife worked on the 87th floor . She called me that morning . I didn 't pick up the phone . Today , right here , right now , you have a choice . Your father wouldn 't want you to be doing this . He didn 't die for you to just throw away your life . Don 't let this man take everything away from you . Don 't let him win . ( woman screams , sobs ) I followed him home . He lives at Hotel Monte Real . It 's a rat hole on East Broadway and Pike . Not a care in the world . He goes on living while my family 's dead . Fate put me here . We make our own fate . I have nothing left to lose . ( bus honks ) Take me to the airport , please ! MARTIN : Open the doors ! Open the door , please . Sir , you need to get off the bus . - What ... ? - The girl back there , she 's got a gun . She 's from El Mozole . Now ! Go ! ( horns honking ) Stay with me ! Get out of the way ! Move ! Let me off ! Come on , this way . - How do you know who I am ? - The girl on the bus . Look , I don 't have time to explain . Who is she ? Who is she ? You raided her village . You killed her father and her little brother . No ! No , that 's not possible ! Listen to me . She 's not ... I 'm trying to help you . She 's not going to stop until she kills you . - Shut up ! - Get back . Don 't shoot ! - Today , you die . MARTIN : - No . Today , we change fate . ( fire alarm walls ) I don 't want to hurt you ! You shouldn 't even be here ! This is exactly where I 'm supposed to be . He killed my family ! You can 't kill a man in the street like this . Please , look at me . You have a choice . You do not have to do this . ( deep , rhythmic drumming ) ( laughing ) Thank you ! Dad told me you two did this together . I can 't believe it was your idea . Oh , well , I , um ... He 's really not a bad guy . He 's just not you . Hai . ( laughs ) ( explosive crackling ) ( grunts ) No ! Watch out ! Oh , no . Oh , my God . I 'm sorry . She 's still alive ! Please . Someone call 911 ! Please ! Call 911 ! You 're going to be all right . Stay with me . Hey . It 's me . I 'm at Victory Memorial Hospital . Something happened . I 'll be there in ten minutes . CLEA ( on phone ) : Mr. Bohm , stop . Listen to me . The eval ... it 's over . It 's too late . What do you mean ? It can 't be too late . This is my son we 're talking about . Look , tell them anything . I was in an accident . I tried . I stalled . I came just short of begging , but ... Look , you know I 'd do anything if I thought it would make a difference , but it won 't . The psychologist already left . There 's nothing more either one of us can do . Ms. Hopkins , please . Jake gave me a pattern , a road map . He wants me to follow it . He needs me to follow it . I have to go now , Mr. Bohm . Wait , please . Hello ? ( breathing heavily ) Son of a bitch . Exodus 22 : 22 . " Do not take advantage of children whose fathers have died . " ( panting , whimpering ) ( screams ) ( baby crying ) Thank you . There will be other girls . Not like her . Hey . Hey ! Wait ! Wait ! If I was going to turn you into police they would be already here . What do you want ? Your tattoo ... " Do not take advantage of the children whose fathers have died . " What does that mean ? I saved your life . You owe me at least that . You must understand ... we were at war . I was there that day in El Mozole , and the men were killed in the name of our country . And the children ? You killed the children , too . ( choked up ) : A few of us , we couldn 't do it . We took them to the local church , where the missionaries assured us that they would be taken far away . That they 'd be safe . Where ? Canada . That 's all I know , but it 's the truth . I swear it . Marisol 's brother is still alive . Excuse me . Is Marisol Flores awake yet ? - You family ? - No . Look , I-I-I brought her in . I just need to ask her some ... What is that ? It 's a request from a donor database . So , what , you 're looking for donor matches ? HIPAA prevents me from sharing patient information . I understand that . I know this is going to sound weird , but my son drew a design exactly ... Sir , I 'm going to have to ask you to ... Gabriel , Hospitalier de Montreal . I 'm calling security . It says he 's Salvadorean . Don 't call security . I think I found your donor match . The patient 's name is Marisol Flores , please . Just give me five minutes , and I can prove it to you . They 're related . ( knocks ) - Get out ! - Please , I just need to tell you something . Haven 't you done enough already ? Just listen to me . You were right , okay ? It was just like you said . Fate put you on that bus for a reason . It was to find your brother . He 's alive . No . He was smuggled out of the country and adopted by a family in Montreal . That 's where he is now , in a hospital just like this . Marisol ... he 's sick . He needs a donor for a bone marrow transplant , and if you 're a match , you could ... Stop ! Please stop . My whole life , I believed ... no , I knew . I saw what happened , what that man did . What that man did was unspeakable . He killed your father , and for that , there 's no ... no excuse . But he spared the children . You weren 't wrong . There was just more to the story . There 's only one way you can know the truth . Please , take a leap of faith . Please . ( beeping ) DOCTOR : Nice work . - Thank you . - You wish to give his parents the good news ? Uh , actually , I have a train to catch . Pardon . Pardon . Hi . I 'm Sami . You broke your heel . Want to go get a coffee or something ? Hey , buddy . You 're still awake . One full minute on each side , okay ? That was always World War Three for us . Jake craves routine . He gets that here . He could get that at home , too . I know , but if the state has its way , he could be getting it in Rhode Island . What are you talking about ? The level of care that Jake requires . After today 's evaluation , they 're questioning whether New York has the appropriate facility to meet Jake 's needs . They want to move him ? Let me talk to them . Look , there was an accident . I was on a bus , and ... This time , it was an accident , but what about next time ? It has to stop . Unbelievable . My son is finally communicating with me- - my son ! - - and you people are telling me not to listen ? No , but until this evaluation process is over , I 'm asking you to change the conversation . You keep tilting at windmills , they 're going to take him away . You don 't want that ; I don 't want that . So , please , just give me something to work with . SARAH ( over stereo ) : Hey there , Jake . It 's Mommy . You know that if I could be there , I would always , always be there with you . But with my job and ... well , you know , there will be nights when I can 't be , so ... on those nights , you can listen to this , and it 'll be like I never left . Like I 'm right there sitting on the end of your bed . Hey , little sleepy boy do you know what time it is ? JAKE : The threads that connect us are not bound by space and time . What seems to the individual like a twist of fate , from another perspective , is simply one of those threads pulled tight . How things should have been all along . ( video rewinds ) MAN ( over video ) : Without you , these children would be lost . ARTHUR : There 's something different , something evolutionary , a higher state of consciousness . These children are here for a reason . They 're here to teach us . INTERVIEWER : Without you , these children would be lost . ( video rewinds ) Without you , these children would be lost . ( video rewinds ) These children would be lost . JAKE : And even when those threads seem irreparably frayed ... they never break . SARAH : - Hey , little sleepy boy - Not completely . Do you know what time it is ? Well , the hour of your bedtime 's long been past And though I know you 're fighting it ... JAKE : But sometimes the most important connection is here and now . You 're fading fast . Good night , my sweet son . I love you .

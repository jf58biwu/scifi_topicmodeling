 Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day , it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever . But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Rebecca Pine thinks Chester 's Mill can 't sustain itself for much longer . She and Jim wanna use the census to decide who lives and who doesn 't . That pig virus is their extermination plan . Yeah , she doesn 't know how strong it is . Get away from me . Unh ! You tried to kill us all . - What are you doing here ? - She 's joining you in jail . What are you gonna do to us ? Tomorrow we 'll have a town meeting . The people can decide your fate . You 've come to set me free . My mother said you had answers . I want them . This is it , right ? Those are the fingertips of a hand . Looks like Angie got a piece of whoever did this to her . What do you say , Phil ? Can I count on you ? I am Melanie Cross . And I think this is where I died . Oh , my God . - We have to help her . - I don 't think we can . - It 's too late . - She 's dying ! What are you doing ? You were moaning . - Nightmare ? - No , just a dream . Not as scary as waking up to you two standing over me . None of us sleep very well these days . I need to find Sam Verdreaux . Find out what really happened the night I died . I know you want some answers , but we promised Barbie we wouldn 't do anything until after he talks to Julia . I need to talk to you . I have to find our mystery girl . Didn 't come home last night . - Melanie stayed with Joe and Norrie . - Melanie ? How do you know her name ? It 's a long story . You wouldn 't happen to know where Sam is ? He just left . We were up all night working . Why are you looking for Sam ? Because I think he 's known who Melanie is all along . All right , tell me everything . The kids found her picture in the school yearbook . So she 's a student here ? Was . In 1988 . I know . I 'm still processing all of this . She also knows exactly where Joe and Norrie found the mini-dome . - How ? - Twenty-five years ago , she and three of her friends found a meteorite in exactly the same spot in the woods . With an egg inside . Melanie said that when she found it , that she wanted to protect it . And the others got violent . And then one of her friends killed her . She 's not sure who . Who were the three friends ? Pauline Verdreaux , Lyle Chumley and Sam . This is crazy . This is just par for the course for Chester 's Mill . And we need to talk about what happened the other day . About you supporting Jim and Rebecca 's extermination plot ? - How could you think I 'd actually ... ? - Because I was there . I was listening so I could make sure I knew exactly what they were up to . So I could stop them . I made Jim look me in the eye and promise me that he wasn 't going to do anything . I don 't know that I believe that . If you wanna think that I 'm the bad guy , then fine . Be prepared to think far worse of Sam Verdreaux . What the hell are you doing ? Trying to find what you 've been hiding from me . Like my mom 's journal . I don 't have it , Junior . - Someone stole it . - That was Lyle . Lyle 's in jail . He was until I snuck him out . He told me my mom 's journal had predictions in it . Like who was gonna kill Angie . - What did you find out ? - I didn 't get that far . He attacked me and he ran off with it . Didn 't want me to see what was in it . So he must 've killed Angie , right ? He always has been a little nuts . A page is missing from the journal . I thought if I 'd find it I 'd figure out where he 's going or what he 'll do next . Or where he 's run off to . You won 't find anything . If Lyle hurts somebody else , it 's on me . So we 'll stop him . Together . I should have never trusted him , no matter what my mom said . Your mother told you to trust Lyle ? Before she died ? Two days ago , she sent me an e-mail . She 's alive . She 's out there somewhere . I was wondering when you two would show . Yeah , we 're just looking for Carolyn and the kids . In the back . I can bring you cereal , toast and tea . Where 'd you get all the food ? Secret store in the basement . Angie told me about it , God rest her soul . Oh , and we 're all waiting for the town meeting , Julia . If she 's eating here , I ain 't . Hey , it 's a free town . Not since Big Jim went to jail . Did I hear you right , Greg ? You throwing your lot in with the guy who tried to murder us with a virus ? Jim wasn 't caught with no virus . It was a setup , all right ? So she can take over and put him on trial . - Get off me ! - Whoa ! That 's enough . Hey . Back off . This trial of yours ? It better reach the right verdict . - Did you find Lyle ? - Not yet . Junior and I spent all night combing the town for him , but no sign of him . I should be looking for him . This place is a powder keg . No . I want the three of you to lie low today . This trial has to happen soon . I plan on reading the charges against Jim and Rebecca at the town meeting . They 'll need representation too . Which is where you come in , I hope . Mom as Big Jim 's lawyer ? He 's so totally guilty . Everyone deserves a fair trial . I guess I 'll go escort my new clients to the town hall . I 'll see you there , Julia . Thank you , Carolyn . I filled Julia in on everything we found out about Melanie , but only Julia . I 'm really sorry that I wasn 't there with you yesterday , Melanie . I know who I am now . But why am I back ? I don 't know . But there is a reason . I promise I 'll find out what it is . Sam will be at the town hall . Barbie and I will talk to him . All right , but he 's right . You kids stay . Okay ? Let us get some answers first . I just found out I died . I can 't just sit around and do nothing . Come on . I know where to go . Hey ! - Anybody out there ? - Okay , enough , Jim . I 've got a headache . Oh , you got a headache , huh ? I 'm just about starving in here . Come on . It 's only been one night . Julia promised a trial . She 'll come for us , okay ? Yeah , she 'll come for us , all right . Then what ? She 'll hang us ? We were just trying to keep everyone from starving to death . Everyone thinks I 'm some sort of serial killer . And it 's all your fault . You convince me that your plan is the right thing to do , then you ... You trick me into not being able to do it . I told you . The virus was stronger than I thought . If the evidence changes , your thinking has to change . It 's called science . I don 't care what you call it . Now everybody 's out there for our blood . Thanks , everyone , for joining me today . I know it 's been a rough week , but I think it 's time for us to focus on our future . Where 's that piece of crap , Big Jim ? He and Rebecca Pine will be arraigned and tried in front of a jury . The process will be fair and impartial . First , though , I 'd like to talk to you about the food situation . Supplies are running low . - What ? - Come on . But there 's no need to panic . We can get through this by coming together . Which is why I 'm initiating a voluntary food-share program . People can bring whatever they have to the Chester 's Mill fire station . Volunteers will oversee distribution , ensuring no one goes hungry . You want me to give up my family 's food ? That 's crazy . Participation is completely voluntary . But pooling our resources is the best way to ensure everyone gets fed . - There 's the son of a bitch . - There he is . Why 'd you try to kill us all , Jim ? Everything I did , I did for this town . I love Chester 's Mill . I 'll prove that I 'm innocent of these charges . Good luck , honey . Today we arraign Jim Rennie and Rebecca Pine - on the following charges ... - It 's all lies . - You deserve to be on trial , not him . - Yeah . - Wait a minute ... - Tell us what you think ! She 's too inefficient , right ? Folks , calm down and just let her speak . Calm down . Back up . Let her speak . - Watch out . - Don 't you touch me ! Phil , get them out of here . Big Jim , Rebecca , let 's go . Gun ! Hey , look out ! Look out ! No ! - You okay ? - Move ! He 's dead . I just can 't believe Pauline is still alive . Why would she let us believe that she was dead for so long , - even if she was protecting us ? - You were a kid . Maybe you needed protecting . I didn 't . When Pauline started ranting about some dome , I stopped believing in her . It crushed her . What kind of person lets her brother and her son spend a decade mourning while she sends postcards to her insane ex-boyfriend ? And not warning us about who was really gonna die ? Like Angie . If I could just get to her , things would be different . She 'd tell me if I was doing the right thing . When I lost Mom , it was the worst pain ever . Until Angie . Lyle took the best thing I had . And when I find him , I 'm gonna make him suffer . Right before I put a bullet between his eyes . You know what , kid ? Maybe those missing journal pages are the key to finding Lyle . I 've been looking for him everywhere . I might know a place . You only have yourself to blame . You and Jim and your insane reduction plan has people terrified . We 're lucky only Wendell died today . Anybody could 've been hit . A kid or me or you . Thank you . Just so you know , what Jim said about Barbie being involved ? He wasn 't . We went behind his back . Barbie always believed there was another way . - Phil , stop . - Why ? I don 't answer to you . Yes , you do . This town put me in charge . Well , Big Jim made me sheriff , and when people are at risk , I act . You could have just arrested Wendell . Barbie had already disarmed him . Instead you killed him . I did what I had to do to keep this town safe . Wendell is dead , not to mention the fact that Lyle escaped on your watch and is still on the loose . Maybe that badge is too big for you . You want me to quit ? - You gonna make me ? - No , not her . Me . You two really are drunk on power , huh ? We 'll see what Big Jim has to say . Hmm ? If you 'd been sheriff today , no one would 've been killed . - Julia ... - You have the perfect background . - Your military training ... - And ... And a few hours ago , you accused me of siding with Big Jim . Now you want me to be the person in charge of keeping him locked up . I should 've trusted you . I 'm sorry I didn 't . That 's good to hear . This town just has a funny way of turning on people . And I 'm not ready to jump back into the fray . I get it . I 'll find someone else . I 'm gonna go . Lyle 's still out there . Maybe he 's with Sam . Yeah , well , we 'll find him . We 'll put them in a room and find out what happened all those years ago . We have to . For Melanie 's sake . Yeah . So when you touch the dome , it shows you stuff ? Yeah . Visions , I guess . Seriously ? Hey , you told us you died and we got onboard . Have some team spirit . But what if it shows me something awful ? You 'll get over it . We have . When you touch the dome for the first time , it 's gonna give you a little shock . So if you get scared , just let go . What do you see ? Nothing . Absolutely nothing . You sure about this ? I already searched this place pretty good . I 've known Lyle a long time . Guy 's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve . - Well , what do you know ? - You found them . See ? Your mom did draw Angie . Lyle stole these to keep me from knowing what he did . But ... But why kill Angie ? He hardly knew her . Maybe this has something to do with it ? The four hands . Pauline ranted about a lot of things . Pink stars , a dome that would trap us , and the four hands that would be its protectors . She used to say , " Four hands will hold up the dome , and without them it will fall . " If one of the hands wasn 't around , the dome would come down ? That 's why Lyle did it . He killed Angie to bring down the dome . So Angie was one of the four hands ? Maybe all four hands have to die for it to work . I have to go . Have to make sure the other hands are okay . The other hands ? Do you know who they are ? Yeah . Joe , Norrie and me . If Lyle thinks that killing the four hands will bring down the dome , any one of us could be next . Hey , Jim ? Uh-huh . You ever seen a man die ? I mean , before today ? It 's a sad fact of my life that I have . Yeah . So how do you deal with it ? Just by knowing it 's all part of a larger design . Wendell 's death means we get to live . I 'd say that 's a pretty good trade-off . That ... That 's what I told myself about our population plan . But today , watching the life go out of Wendell ... Death isn 't pretty , Rebecca . Sometimes it 's necessary . I 've always looked at things clinically . Run tests , you get results , and then take action . I thought it made me strong . But ? When I was in the church yesterday , about to release the virus , and I saw those families , it reminded me of my mom . When I thought about causing those families to suffer the way she did , I ... That 's why you couldn 't do it ? What if my dad was right and sometimes there really aren 't answers ? Well , maybe your dad is right . That doesn 't mean we stop trying . Look , I trusted you . I had your back . I need you to have mine . You 're right . I ... I do . Big Jim . Drinking on the job , sheriff ? Nope . Julia fired me . Had to sneak past my own deputies to get in here . Oh , well . That ain 't right . You 're a good man , Phil . Best sheriff this town 's ever had . - Better than Duke ? - And Linda . Your plan to release that virus ? You had no other choice , right ? I didn 't even have the virus . Rebecca did . But if we don 't do something , then none of us are gonna get out of here alive . Now Julia 's made you her scapegoat . Right when this town needed you most . Wait , wait , wait . No , no . Not that way . Okay , half this town hates me . Okay ? If you let me out , they 're gonna ... They 're gonna string me up . Then how do we make this right ? We gotta win over their hearts and minds . Still nothing . The dome kind of has a mind of its own . Maybe it 's not in the mood . What if we try touching it at the same time ? Worked for me and Norrie . Because you guys aren 't some kind of undead freak . Melanie , we 're gonna figure this out . How long will that take ? I still have no idea why I 'm back . None of us know why we 're trapped inside this fishbowl . You need to deal . Think of it this way . You were alive , then dead , now alive again . Two out of three ain 't bad . You don 't know what I 'm going through . No . I don 't . But I know how much I 'd give to have my mom alive again . If it 'd bring her back , I 'd trade you rotting in the bottom of that crater in a heartbeat . You know , I 've defended you a lot . But sometimes you 're a real bitch . Melanie , wait . Joe ? Norrie ? Are you guys here ? They aren 't here either . Maybe we should head back to Julia 's . They weren 't there . Or at the Sweetbriar or anywhere else in town . What if Lyle already got them ? If he hurts them , I won 't be able to forgive myself . Junior , there 's no way Lyle can know they 're part of the four hands . Your friends are safe . What are you looking for ? You gotta take a minute and calm down . You 're no good to anyone in this state . You haven 't had a drink since the dome came down . You sure you wanna do this ? My dead sister 's alive , my nephew 's on some nutball 's hit list . Yeah , I wanna do this . Another one ? Melanie ! Melanie . - You gotta understand about Norrie ... - It 's not her , it 's me . I wanna be happy . But I feel so alone . And I 'm not normal either . You 're normal to me . Didn 't find your answers touching the dome , hey , maybe you 'll find them by sticking your tongue down his throat . Actually , I 'm wondering what he sees in you , since you treat him and everyone else like crap . Hey . Stop ! - Norrie , are you okay ? - Don 't even , Joe . You 're bleeding . - You 're about to be . - Hey . I 've got an idea . Unh . Here we go . Food drive 's going well . It 's a decent turnout . But for this to work , we need everyone 's help . I 'm gonna put these in the fridge . Oh , can you stack those boxes ? Yes . Carolyn . Let 's go . - Where 's Julia ? - Still inside . - Julia ? - Over here . All right , come on ! Come on , this way . Go ! As soon as it 's safe to enter the building , we will assess the damage , see what remains . The last of my food was in there . What will my family eat tonight ? Please , I just need everyone to stay calm . - Don 't tell us to stay calm . - Hey , Phil . - Watch yourself . - So I can 't even speak now ? These people need to know the truth . Julia 's big plan ? It was just a way to take everybody 's food away . I didn 't take anything . Then she sticks it all in one place with a beat-up generator . If she had bothered to check , she would 've seen the wires were frayed . Big Jim never would have made that mistake . And now we 're all gonna starve . What am I gonna feed my kids ? Where am I gonna get food tomorrow ? All right , I will get to the bottom of what happened and find a solution . I just need everyone to calm down . This is not over . Hey . You okay ? We 're screwed . Phil 's right . It 's all my fault . I didn 't check the generators . I didn 't even think to check . And I screwed up with you . I should have believed you . That goes both ways . Do you hear me ? We both made mistakes . What now ? Now we figure out who caused the explosion . Phil said the wires were frayed . You don 't believe him ? No , there 's something else going on . I found a bunch of empty boxes right before that explosion . Only one person in town that could do that . Well , I 'd ask who that was , but it 's a little obvious . I 'll go talk with Big Jim . I just wish I knew what to do . No matter what , I can 't seem to please more than half the town at a time ... Don 't give up . There 's a way out of this . You 're gonna find it . Okay ? You okay ? - Ow . - Sorry . No , please . Let me . Ah ! So , what 's this gonna show ? Hopefully , if there are differences between us , a guy who 's always been alive , me , and someone like you . - Are we different ? - I 'm not sure . Little out of my depth here . Miss Pine would definitely be able to tell us what this means . So what ? We break her out of jail ? - I 'm just saying . - She tried to kill everyone in town . We can 't just do nothing . This blood thing could be the answer to who I am . Yeah , or end up like everything else . Big fat dead end . Well , well , well . Look who it is . You sheriff by now ? Or did the new queen bee just go ahead and anoint you king of Chester 's Mill ? Shut your mouth , Jim . There 's no audience down here . There was an explosion at the firehouse . All the food that was stored there is gone . You think I 'd put this town at risk by burning up its food supply ? That 's a new level of crazy , Barbie . Even for you . Oh , my God . Phil . He was down here grousing about Julia taking his badge , and he mentioned something about the food program . So that 's how you 're gonna play this ? Throw Phil under the bus ? Don 't take my word for it . Ask ... Ask Rebecca . I must 've been asleep when Phil came in . I didn 't hear anything . Nice try , Jim . Fine . You can go about your day thinking I 'm responsible for the explosion . That 's , you know ... Just be ready for whatever madness Phil has planned next . Phil ? What are you doing in here ? Just making sure the place is secure . Is there food in there ? We weren 't using this room . Maybe someone moved it . Why would they ? Unless they knew the explosion was coming ? My mom lied to everyone . The only one she loves is Lyle . I hear you , buddy . And they 're both crazy . They 're crazy-ing it up together . Yeah , sleep this one off . Hmm . I don 't wanna do this to you . You or Angie . If there was any other way to bring the dome down , I 'd do it . I 'm sorry . Thanks for looking out for me . You 're the only family I have left . Love you , Uncle Sam . Hey . On the ground . Get on the ground . - Right now . - No , Barbie . That 's what you 're gonna do . Come on . This is not you , Phil . I know you don 't wanna hurt anyone . - Drop her , Phil . - You 're done being a hero , Barbie . Drop now . You all right ? Yeah . You ? I am now . Oh , Julia . What a nice surprise . Do you have a minute ? I 'm just wondering about what 's happening at the Sweetbriar Rose . I see you there feeding everyone . And I wonder where the food is coming from . The basement pantry . I just checked there . It 's empty . Andrea , you 're doing an amazing job . The town continues to live because of you . I just think I owe it to everyone to at least ask . There 's something I have to show you . Oh , my God . This is just the start . The entire basement is filled . There 's enough to feed the town for a couple months . - Where did you get all this food ? - From Lloyd . My late husband . Lloyd called himself a survivalist . He always saw something bad around the corner . Thank God . He said when the crisis hit , it 'd be every man for himself . I 'm sorry I didn 't come forward . I was just scared someone would steal it from me . But I trust you . You should use it . We use it together . Uncle Sam ? My mom painted that when I was in the second grade . I brought it in for show and tell . I 'm guessing you 've never seen this before . Oh , my God . The obelisk . I saw this in a dream I had . - My mom was there too . - 1821 . The number of the locker at school where Angie got killed . It 's also in your mother 's journal on the last page . I had no idea what it meant . Lyle saw something in the journal before he ran off . Maybe he went back to the locker . Why would he go there ? I don 't know . But it obviously means something to him . Maybe we haven 't found Lyle because we haven 't checked there . This is amazing . It 's like Thanksgiving in July . It 's all Julia . Where 'd you get the food ? Trade secret . But be sure to thank Andrea for hosting such a lovely event . Thanks , hon . One nice meal doesn 't prove anything . You 're no Big Jim . Well , I 'll let him decide that . What the hell are we doing here ? Oh , just wait and see . Folks , I said this morning that I thought it was time for us Millers to focus on our future . But I don 't think we can do that until we let go of the past . Even the actions of those who have wronged us . What Big Jim and Rebecca tried to do yesterday is inexcusable . But it 's not unforgivable . Now , we can stay angry and tear each other apart , or we can rise above and work together , and ensure our survival under this dome . I admit , I 've made some mistakes . But all of them in service of this town . And I really appreciate , Julia , you giving me the chance to ... To make amends . And you all should know I think she 's done a hell of a job running Chester 's Mill . All right ! - Great . - Thank you . - Good job . - Yeah . Enjoy the food . I don 't understand you . You keep saying you 're on my side , but it seems like you turned on me . I just think maybe we should give Julia a chance . Maybe benevolence isn 't such a bad quality in a leader . Or it 's the thing that 's gonna get us all killed . Look what you did . It wouldn 't have happened without you . Well , I don 't know about that . Have you found a new sheriff yet ? Why ? You have someone in mind ? I might . I 'm sorry about earlier . You kissed her , Joe . Yeah , but she 's not who I love . You are . That 's your go-to ? After you 've macked on another chick in front of my face ? Try it on her . She 's dumb enough to fall for it . Hi . Julia , I 'm impressed . Especially with what you did for Jim and me . I did what was best for the town . I just wanted to say thank you . Julia , we 've got a quick question back here . Joe says you 're really , really smart . Like a scientist . Thank you . I have something I want you to figure out . About me . Junior ? What are you doing ? This is where Angie died . It meant something to the killer . Looks like the whole thing 's been kicked in . Give me your flashlight . It 's big enough for a man . Do you think this is where Lyle disappeared to ? It 's a tunnel . Yeah , but to where ?

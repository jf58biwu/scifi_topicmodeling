 Engines are running at full capacity , sir . Lieutenant chung did a whale of a job while I was down . Indeed he did . Should be in costa rica by tomorrow morning . Attention on deck ! How far inland are we going , sir ? Carry on . Dr. Scott said the jungle there is relatively close To the shoreline . Should give us easy access in and out . Sounds good , sir . These gonna work for you , sir ? Yeah . Good work . Well done , men . Don 't exactly love the idea of experimenting on monkeys . Better than humans , sir . [ whirring ] Hey , max . What 's up ? Hey . Fancy meeting you here . It 's been a month since I 've had any spare time to exercise . Other than sprinting away from the russians in the arctic . [ chuckles ] Yeah , heard about that . Pretty ballsy ... If I do say so myself . Survival instinct . Nothing more . [ machine beeps , powers down ] [ exhales ] [ weights clank ] Dumbbell ? [ chuckles ] no . I think I 'm done , thanks . How come I never see you up in the wardroom ? For meals ? Well ... You might not have heard , But I 'm not particularly well-liked on this ship . Ha ! I find that hard to believe . [ sniffs ] I had to ... Lie to them all For four months . While we were up in the arctic , The world was crumbling . Their families were dying . I knew it , and I wasn 't allowed to breathe a word of it . I think you underestimate People 's capacity for forgiveness . Maybe you just find it too hard to forgive yourself . It 's not all on you , you know . Isn 't it ? No . [ clack ] I 'll see you later . Wardroom . I 'll save a spot for you . [ huffs ] Chandler : Wednesday , November 5th . We 're headed to costa rica To try to find dr . Scott some monkeys . I don 't know why I keep making these recordings Or who might ever find them And how they 'd even get ' em to you . [ chuckles ] I keep trying to picture you all In my father 's cabin . You could barely spend a holiday weekend with the man , So you 're probably just about ready To tear his head off by now . It 's hard here ... Not knowing what 's going on in the outside world , Wondering if ... When ... When we come home ... What we 'll be coming back to . [ knock on door ] Hey . Sorry to disturb you . We 're picking up all kinds of distress signals Coming out of costa rica , especially outside limón . What kind of distress ? Lot of sickness . Civil unrest . Doesn 't look like we 're gonna get any kind of safe passage Into that jungle . Civil unrest ? Nothing we can do anything about , Not unless you wanna get sidetracked for weeks And get into the nation-building business . Better get dr . Scott up here . I already spoke to her . She said our next best option 's nicaragua . There 's a monkey reserve about 30 miles Up that long , narrow river . We 'll never get the ship in there , But we could send a few teams on the r.H.I.B.S. 30 miles . Yeah . Outside radar range . Comms is unsure whether the frequency signals In that area will be strong enough For us to keep in radio contact , too . Just keeps getting better . Oh , you haven 't heard the best part . Dr. Scott insists that she comes along for the ride . Mm . Unless any of us can tell the difference Between a capuchin tufted and a ... [ imitates british accent ] geoffroy 's spider monkey . Is that reserve inhabited ? She said she was there a few years back , But there are only small teams of anthropologists That visit sometimes to observe , So otherwise , not supposed to be . Gonna need plenty of room on that r.H.I.B. For those monkeys . We 'll go with small teams . You 'll handle it . Not just me . Gonna need all my best men . That includes you . Been a while since I 've been hunting . Mm .

They will report in , but we will not respond . We do expect the teams will fall out of range . When they do , we 'll go to a flare system . Green means no radio contact available , But all is okay . Red means no radio , And things are not okay . We 're gonna hope we never see that red flare , But we 're prepared in case we do . I 'll need a dedicated lookout on the bridge wing . Aye , commander . [ pinging ] [ motor rumbling ] Look familiar ? Well , this is the edge of the reserve . As I recall , there 's a stream in there near a waterfall . The monkeys would congregate there Because of the clean water . Report our position back to the ship . Yes , sir . Tex , burk , Stay here with mason and dr . Scott . The rest of us will scout the area . Captain chandler , we - - you 're staying here . Got it . They just disembarked At the western edge of the reserve , southern bank , Still in radio range . [ birds chirping ] [ animal chittering ] Hey , uh , doc , you got a ... Fella ? Last I heard , he was in beijing , but that was months ago now . He 's a journalist . Travels a lot . And you ? Oh , I 'm a bit of a rolling stone , As you might imagine . A man your age , never married ? A man my age ? [ laughs ] Hit a soft spot , did I ? Oh , I 'm 2 % body fat , honey . Ain 't no soft spot to hit . [ under breath ] except for that 2 % . Oh ! She is a smart one , isn 't she ? [ laughs ] [ animal calling in distance ] [ water rushing ] [ gasps ] hear that ? Water . Waterfall . [ monkey screeching in distance ] [ crying and speaking in spanish ] Masks ! Now ! Masks ! [ continues crying ] Man : Iel toro ! Iel toro , por favor ! Fall back ! Fall back ! [ indistinct shouting ] There 's nothing we can do for you . I 'm sorry ! To the boat now ! [ shouting continues ] I 'm sorry . We cannot help you . [ shouting in spanish ] Where are they all coming from ? Get away ! Get off me ! [ indistinct shouting ] Man : El toro , señor . Get out of here . Get back to the boats now ! Iel toro ! I 'm sorry . We can 't help you . Stay back ! Move , move , move ! Iel toro ! Hey , burky . Cubano ? Perks of gitmo , my man . I 'll wait . All right . We 've got trouble . Start your engines ! [ click , engine starts ] you are out of here ! Now ! Back to the james ! I cannot risk you going upriver ! It is not open for debate ! We 'll get you an assortment of monkeys ! You 're just gonna have to make do ! Now , burk ! [ engine rumbling ] [ woman yelling indistinctly ] [ radio chatter , pinging ] Garnett : They 're splitting up . That was not the plan . According to this chart , the nearest town Is 20 miles inland on that side of the river . So they made it all the way here through the jungle on foot ? What about the other side of the river ? Nothing , sir , at least not here . They must have been congregating by the waterfall . There 's gotta be other places in this region to find monkeys . We already know costa rica 's no good . According to dr . Scott , Most of central america 's a hot zone With not many choices . Upriver . [ engine rumbling ] [ pinging ] Ma 'am , tex and lieutenant burk just landed with dr . Scott . She 's in decon now . I 'll debrief her in the wardroom , asap . Yes , ma 'am . [ pinging , radio chatter ] Nathan james , this is vulture team . Over . Nathan james , this is vulture team . Over . We 're out of range , sir . All right , send up the green flare . Yes , sir . Clear ! [ shot ] What the ... Weapons ! " el toro " ? That 's what all the sick people were saying . Board it , sir ? Absolutely not . We keep moving . So the most concentrated area for the primates Is on the northern bank , deep upriver , And the captain knows as much . I suspect they 're headed that way . And you have no reason to believe There 's any human population there ? No , but I didn 't think There 'd be any on the southern side either . So once they are out of radio range , They can 't come back in , correct ? It 'll be flares from here on out . We just have to hope the weather 's clear enough That we can even see them . Perhaps you should send a backup team out there On the other r.H.I.B. Captain would 've specified that . Protocol was 48 hours , unless we get that red flare . [ sighs ] [ whispers ] damn it . [ birds calling and chirping ] [ whack ] aah ! Oh , shit ! Oh , god ! Set a perimeter ! I got you , I got you . [ mason panting ] oh ! Listen , I 'm not gonna lie to you . This is gonna hurt .

[ baby crying ] [ conversations in spanish ] [ speaks spanish ] [ crying ] [ men continue speaking spanish ] [ spanish continues ] [ indistinct conversations , rooster crows ] [ chickens clucking ] Man : El toro , los americanos . [ rooster crows ] [ speaks spanish ] Hello . Welcome to my jungle . I 'm guessing you must be el toro . I am , indeed . And who do I have the pleasure of talking to ? Tom chandler , u.S. Navy . Your men took our weapons , c.B.R. Suits , and equipment . We 're gonna need ' em back . You won 't need your suits . There is no virus here . As for your weapons , I cannot have your men Walking around with machine guns . That would frighten my people . Well , I 'm afraid that 's not acceptable . With respect , I don 't have time to debate it . The remainder of my crew , some 200-odd u.S. Navy sailors , Await our return aboard our destroyer , U.S.S. Nathan james , currently in the bay At the mouth of the river . We don 't return by 2300 hours , they 'll come looking . And rest assured , they will find us . So ... Why are you here , commander ? We 're just passing through . Mm . Looking for food , supplies . Our man stepped on one of your traps . Yes , your man does not look so good . So the sooner we can get him back to the ship - - He is not gonna make it back to the ship , At least not alive . The poison in his veins is gonna kill him soon , And I am the only one with the antidote . So ... You can let us give your man the help he needs , Or you can continue with your , uh ... Impotent threats . You decide . You give my man the antidote right now , And you better hope for your sake it 's not too late . John wayne ! Clint eastwood . American macho . [ under breath ] I don 't suppose this guy 's familiar With what a tomahawk missile can do . You feel better ? You think your power And not my generosity is gonna help your man , huh ? [ birds chirping ] [ speaks spanish ] [ gasping ] I 'm sure you are hungry . So we will dine ... Commander . Hey ! There you are . I was hoping you 'd show up . A little late for the party . What 's mine is yours . Fish is pretty good . Freshly caught this morning , so I 'm told . Team 's not back yet . Heard as much . [ sighs ] No flares either . It 'll be dark soon . Yeah , they 're probably all sitting around a cozy campfire , Telling ghost stories , roasting marshmallows . What you saw in guantanamo bay ... Some of the worst of human nature . Mm-hmm . And yet somehow You still managed to find the humor . Secret source of humor is not joy but sorrow . Ain 't no humor in heaven . Guy named twain said that , more or less . You ever read " huck finn , " " tom sawyer " ? American classics . " everyone is a moon who has a dark side , Which he never shows to anybody . " Yes , I know twain . Well , then ... We have something in common . Marshmallows , huh ? No doubt . You must wonder how I managed to achieve such opulence Out here in the wilderness . We saw your yacht on our way up the river . Mm . [ chuckles ] my captain said the waters would be much deeper . It turns out he was wrong , yeah . It 's impressive , no ? It took my men one week To take everything off of the sinking ship . Please . Delgado , come join us . Sit , sit . This is mayor ervin delgado , Former mayor of former town , bocana caoba . He and his people - - they stumbled upon us , Trying to escape the virus . Lucky for them , they found me . Lucky for you , they had tents . Can 't imagine you thought of that , Since you were expecting to be living off your boat . [ liquid pouring ] hmm . That 's very perceptive . Bravo . And they sleep out there , On those filthy blankets With no shelter from the elements While you live like this ? I don 't expect you to understand my methods , so , bas . Explain to them . Society is based on the ancient inca system Of labor exchange known as mita . Our people provide the labor . El toro provides the infrastructure And protection . Protection ? Yes , sir . Where we 're from , we call that slavery . These people are alive While millions around the world are not , because of me . These guards of mine , That trap that your man stepped on - - These are the things that keep the people On the other side of the river that are sick away from here . This is what keeps delgado 's people alive . Is that not right , bas ? Yes , el toro . Sí . Now please , eat , eat , eat , eat . The ladies have prepared the local delicacy For you to enjoy , so ... [ silverware clinking ] [ man speaks spanish ] I think his fever is going down . Whatever he gave him seems to be working . You think they 're really gonna let us leave here ? [ man shouts in spanish ] So how is it that you made all your money ? I 'm guessing it wasn 't ladies ' handbags . No . I 'm thinking cocaine . Heroin , maybe . Mm . Now you judge . I 'm just trying to get a sense for who we 're dealing with . Mike . Hmm . Mm-hmm . Hmm . Ah , no , no , this - - this is , uh ... This is karina . This is , uh , the mayor 's daughter . Mayor delgado . Big man . Big family . All daughters , you know . All very , very beautiful . And this one , karina - - she is in her prime . Well , almost . Her younger sister - - she 's the real prize . No , no . ¿ qué eso ? ¿ qué eso ? Mi amor , ven . He is a pig . Karina ! My father won 't say it , but I will . No . Please , el toro , she - - she means no disrespect . Bas . She called me " pig . " She - - she - - she means no disrespect . You say you have a ship with guns and men . Then do something ! Karina , iya , ya ! Disculpa , el toro , disculpa . She 's young . There is nothing to be done here . She does not understand . We are safe from the plague , and we are grateful to el toro . Please tell him she has not provoked you . Please . Our only interest is getting out of here with our man healthy . [ speaks spanish ] Sí , señor . Vámonos . [ speaks spanish ] I think maybe it 's time we checked on our man . No , I don 't think so . You have not finished your meal , And there are several things that we need to discuss . [ shouts in spanish ] Several of these were found on your boat . You want to explain to me what they 're for ? Like I told you , we need food . No fishing gear ? You hunt with tranquilizer guns ? I don 't like being lied to , captain , Not after the hospitality that I have extended to you . We 're investigating the virus , Trying to find the cause . We think it may come from the monkeys . That 's why we were wearing the suits . You think the monkeys cause the virus ? It 's a theory . Huh . We have been living amongst them for months . In fact , you just dined on them . If you needed monkeys , all you had to do was ask . It 's the secrets and dishonesty That lead to dangerous misunderstandings . So how many do you need ? [ screeching ] [ men shouting in spanish ] Well , got what we came for . [ man shouts in spanish ] Man : Iya ! Iya , ya ! Man : No . Vámonos . Brandy ? Thank you , no . [ glass clatters ] You know , besides finding those cages , My men also found your radio . Apparently , it does not get a signal out here in the jungle . Depends on which frequency you try . Our comms man is the one who stepped on your spike . Yet you also brought flares . They provide our position . As a matter of fact , we fired one just before We got off our boats outside your compound . So why the different colors ? We use red during the day and green at night . I believe something different . I believe green communicates " all is good , " And red means " danger . " That 's a universal language , no ? [ indistinct conversations ] Ma 'am ? The lookout just saw a new flare . Very low on the horizon , Southwest of our current position . Green or red ? Green , ma 'am . Very well . [ men speaking spanish ] [ grunts ] Uhh ! [ thud ] [ laughter ] Four of them . Two of us . I like our odds . Working on a diplomatic solution here . And what about all these people ? Not our mission . No ? No . Karina : [ sobbing ] please ! Help me , please ! Delgado : Ipor favor , no hagan esto ! [ shouting in spanish ] Hey ! What is this ? They 're taking her across the river ! They 're gonna leave her with the infected people ! No , no , no , no . Uhh ! [ thud ] [ all shouting at once ] [ smack ] [ karina sobbing ] Help me , please ! [ shouting in spanish ] Papa ! Please ! [ all shouting at once ] [ radio chatter ] Old leadbottom wants me back to help him interrogate a spy He caught on our island . It never gets old . [ laughs ] on our island ? ! [ laughs ] must be some mistake . If there were any japanese on our island , we 'd know about it . [ laughter ] You 're not getting much sleep , are you ? [ tv continues playing indistinctly ] [ gasps ] Whoa . It 's okay . [ breathing heavily ] It 's okay . Just me . Everything 's okay . [ breathing heavily ] Something 's happened . No . No , I know it . We saw the flare a couple of hours ago . It was green . Green 's good . Trust me . It 's just a dream . [ man speaks spanish ] [ laughter ] [ man shouts in spanish ] [ speaks spanish ] They killed her . Sons of bitches sent her across the other side , Let her die like that . I 'm only gonna say this once . [ man speaking spanish ] Release my men immediately . [ laughs ] you americans always in charge , right ? Bas . The jefe . You could 've left today with your belly full of mangoes And a boat full of monkeys , but no , no , no . You just could not keep your nose Out of other people 's business ! I don 't know what happened here Or what you 're planning , but let me remind you - - Pfft . Your x.O. Has already briefed me That you 're gonna rain down holy hellfire On the whole jungle . I heard the threats . But you lost radio contact , And your ship does not know where you are . [ laughs ] So what are you gonna do ? You gonna send us to the other side of the river ? You think I can maintain a society without rules ? Without consequences ? It 's the only reason why we are still here And the rest of the world dies around us . Come on . You call this a society ? Commander . We 're gonna keep your weapons , your suits , And the rest of your equipment . You can have your men And your lives and your monkeys . That is the only offer that I give you . Is that clear ? I understand . Oh . One more thing . If you 're thinking of , uh , sending drones or missiles , Just wanna remind you that The children will be sleeping in the tents with me . Starting here . [ crying ] No , no . Bas . No . Bas . No . [ crying ] bas . No ! [ sobbing ] [ speaking spanish ] No ! [ sobbing ] [ sobbing ] [ woman sobbing ] What happened ? We got the monkeys ? Yeah . We got the monkeys . Stop the boat . Stop the boat , master chief . [ engine shuts off ] This cannot stand . Sir , with all due respect - - I know it 's not our mission , and I don 't care . We cannot leave those people like that . I counted 13 guards - - Seven in the tent compound , four in the village . Two on the perimeter . At night , they might up the ante , Especially if they think we might be turning around . Gentlemen , let 's keep our heads cool . This is not the mission at hand . We 're supposed to be saving the world . Shouldn 't it be worth saving ? If we had burk and tex and weapons , maybe , but this ? What if we don 't make it back ? What happens to him , hmm ? What 's dr . Scott gonna do without the monkeys ? What 's our crew gonna do without its leader ? I have daughters . You have a daughter . Sir ? We came to hunt . [ engine starts ] No . [ speaks spanish ] [ speaks spanish ] [ indistinct conversation in spanish ] [ grunts ] aah ! Aah ! [ crunch ] [ grunts ] [ gun clicks ] No te preocupes . [ speaking spanish ] Tome poquito . [ speaks spanish ] Mm-hmm . Sí . [ whispers in spanish ] [ breathing heavily ] [ whispering in spanish ] [ speaking spanish ] [ grunts ] [ grunting continues ] Uhh ! [ gunfire ] [ yells ] [ gunfire continues , man shouts in spanish ] ¿ qué es eso ? [ shouts in spanish ] [ gunfire and shouting in spanish in distance ] You can go help them . [ shouting continues ] I can make it back myself if I have to . [ shouting continues ] [ door creaks ] [ chickens clucking ] Aah ! Aah ! [ grunting ] [ clattering ] [ grunting ] [ bullets ricocheting ] Uhh ! [ thud ] Aah ! Aah ! [ both grunting and yelling ] Go to sleep ! Go to sleep . [ grunts ] Aah ! [ thud ] [ sobbing ] ¿ dónde está el jefe ? Irio , rio ! [ continues sobbing ] [ speaking spanish ] [ shouts in spanish ] ivamos ! [ shouting in spanish ] [ sobbing ] Aah ! [ sobbing ] [ gasps ] [ gasping ] Ipor favor ! You 're finished , bas . It 's over . Drop the knife . [ breathing heavily ] [ gasps ] [ cries ] [ crying ] Okay . I surrender . Come on . Show me that american justice . [ chuckles ] I 'm sure I 'll be fine on your ship . I 've lived in considerably worse places . So arrest me ! Come on ! Huh ? ! [ thud ] [ gasps ] [ stabbing sound ] uhh ! [ blade zings , thud ] Aah ! [ panting and yelling ] [ man speaks spanish ] This place is yours now . [ knife thuds ] Not mine . [ speaking in spanish ] Ours . [ crying ] Mi hija . [ crying ] [ crying ] [ delgado speaking spanish ] Just got word . They 're on their way back . All of them ? Mm-hmm . All of ' em . Uh , plus a boatload of monkeys . [ laughs ] [ chuckles ] Told you there 's nothing to worry about . Why not ? Cheers . [ clink ] cheers .

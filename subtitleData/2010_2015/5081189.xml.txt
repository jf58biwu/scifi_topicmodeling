 I 've never been to this part of the country before . Previously on Touch ... What brought you out here ? Looking for my daughter . My son , Jake , he led me to you to try and help you find your daughter . Amelia ! No ! Amelia ! I can 't do it . My heart is not in it anymore . I don 't need your heart , just your brain . That 's where the money is . You 've never been on my side , Tony . Tony Rigby was my best friend . He took my departure from Aster Corps personally . Guess what I 'm doing ? Watching a certain curly-haired kid and his dad . Why are you following me ? You 're crazy , man . Aah ! Who are you working for ? I 'm making progress , Will . I 'm getting closer . I did it for my brother . I don 't care about your brother . Where is my daughter ? Amelia 's gone . She was here . I know she was . Where is she ? ! Calvin , where is she ? Where did you see my son ? Come on , Phillip , stay with me . I know who did it , and he 's after Jake . The blackest day , the day you were born . Run , Jake ! It 's your moment , Jake . Are you ready ? Bodies at rest stay at rest , and bodies in motion stay in motion , unless acted on by an outside force . What exactly was the plan here , huh ? You realize you would have had to run another day and a half to reach civilization ? Let 's go . People , like objects , become set in their paths , embedded in a constrained reality . As we travel our path , the possible futures , which were once infinite , collapse down to one . One outcome , unchangeable , inescapable . Are you okay ? Fine . You said you could handle her . Now , where are the results you promised ? Where is this transformative data ? Look , the place hasn 't been used in a decade . The power grid is a joke . I blow a fuse every time I charge my phone . If this programms is exposed , we could all go to jail . We have to stay off the radar . This is the safest place right now . What did they do to you ? The new generator is on its way . In the meantime , I need results to take to my boss . If you can 't deliver that , you 're of no use to me . You must have known you weren 't gonna make it . What were you thinking ? Look , this is not like working with Calvin . These people will hurt you . You don 't care about me . You 're just trying to make enough money so you can pay back your bookie . I was desperate , and I made a deal with the wrong people , but pissing them off isn 't gonna help anyone . The only way that we survive this is by proving our value , okay ? I 'm hungry . I 'll get you some breakfast . We 're each on a path , and sometimes those paths become entwined , pulled into each other 's orbits , and collide . Please ! Save me ! Hey , buddy , everything 's gonna be all right , okay ? Martin , I 'm so glad you 're here . - Looks like we may have a problem . - What ? Well , I just checked in on Phil , the guy you saved in the basement . He 's so grateful for everything that you did for him , he 's given a full statement to the police that contradicts everything I said . He told them about me . He gave them yours and Lucy 's full names . What about Jake ? No , he didn 't get that far . He was pretty out of it , but look , it gets worse . there was a detective in there , clearly a high-ranking guy . He had access to my database . Obviously knows more about us than we do about him . Well , then Jake and I will disappear . No , just stay at home . I need to know where to find you . Here 's the cop 's card . Ring any bells ? Denny Lange . I 've never heard of him . Okay , well , just do me a favor . Hang on to the card , lay low . I 'll be in touch . Trevor ? Thank you . Hi , you . How you feeling ? Better . I could sleep for three days , but besides that ... How 's he ? Not good . " 0175 . " So he said this detective has no idea where to find us , right ? He doesn 't have an address or anything ? Not yet , but we need to keep it that way . Well , I told him I was staying in a hotel and I fell through a glass table . I hope that worked . - A glass table ? - Yeah . Pretty good . 0175 . What ? 0175 , Jake wrote that down on the window when we were leaving the hospital . Hold on . I just want to follow him and see where he goes . He 's turning left . Jake , stay in the car . " Rigby . " I think this is Tony Rigby 's house . What is Calvin doing here ? I thought Calvin and Rigby hated each other . So did I. Remember me ? Oh , what are you doing here ? I told you to stay away from me . You also told me that you weren 't working with Tony Rigby . What are you doing here ? Tony Rigby murdered my mother , and he took Amelia . I would never work with Tony Rigby . Where is he ? I don 't know . That 's why I 'm here . He disappeared . I 'm looking for him . He 's with Amelia and you 're gonna help us find her . I told you , I don 't know where she is . Don 't forget I got your files on a hard drive full of information waiting to be handed over to the police . Now where would Aster Corps try to hide Amelia ? Where would they try and hide her ? Somewhere isolated . Somewhere they can control . The problem is they have 83 facilities in seven different countries that match that description . There is a high-level Aster Corps directory . Where would I find that directory ? In my loft . Good . I 'll drive with you and Lucy will follow . The day my mother was killed and Amelia was taken , Kase , my assistant , he never showed up . Somebody had to have given Rigby access to the front door . I 've been trying to reach Kase , but no luck . Yeah , well , everybody 's got their price . Kase knows how I think . He knows my work . He 'll have a new lab up and running in no time . Yeah , but to what end ? I mean , I understand why you would do it , but why would Aster Corps want Amelia ? Knowledge is the new currency . Aster Corps wants to harness Amelia 's incredible predictive abilities . I mean , if they can map her neural pathways , they 'll be able to predict the movements of their stocks , foresee the outcomes of elections , you name it . So it 's all about money ? They abducted a child to increase their profit margins . Is that it ? They don 't see her as a child . They see her as a means to an end . Where 's Jake ? Jake ? Oh , my God . Jake ! Jake , what have you done ? Stop ! You can 't just rip him out ! It 's too dangerous ! - Shut it down . - You can hurt him . - Shut it down ! - I know it looks scary ... You get him out of there , or so help me God , I 'll kill you . Now ! I 'm telling you it 's a mistake . Before Amelia started working with Teller , she was trapped inside her own mind . Maybe Jake knows this can help him . Oh , my God . What ? What is it ? - What do you see ? - These waves here . Wernicke 's and Broca 's , they 're beginning to oscillate . - Is that bad ? - No , it 's just the opposite . What does it mean ? His speech center . It 's getting ready to fire . What are you talking about ? He doesn 't speak . I found you . Where are we ? I don 't know . Ever since I was born , I had this locked door in my mind . And then , one day , when I was working with Calvin it just opened . After that , I could come here whenever I wanted . I could hear you , but I couldn 't get through . What changed ? You see this pattern here ? It indicates both sending and receiving . What does that mean ? He 's having a conversation . With who ? Amelia . Jake , if you 're talking to Amelia , tell her I love her , okay ? Tell her I love her . You mom 's here . She wants you to know that she loves you . I know . I can , I can feel her . Tell her , tell her that we 're coming for her . We 're coming for you . I knew she didn 't give me up . Ask her where she is , if there 's an address , a landmark ? We 're in the desert . There 's a water tower , and the building 's old . I think they used it for other experiments . There 's a sign . It says " Teller Institute , established 1997 . " Jake ! Come on , buddy , please . The conversation 's over . He 's coming out . Jake ? J ... What 's he writing ? " 1997 . " Maybe the year ? 1188 . I know that number . Part of an address , maybe . There are no Aster Corps facilities with 1188 in the address . 1888 . It was the address to Teller 's loft . The one he shared with Avram in New York City . So , what , they took her back there ? No , no , no , Avram would have called me . But obviously this has something to do with Teller . There was something in Teller 's files . By the time I met him , he was already established in New York . But before that , there was another lab , years earlier . Here . In Apple Valley . He started working there in 1997 . I always thought the Teller Institute was just his house in the Bronx . That 's what it became after Aster Corps discredited him . So they took Amelia back to where it began . Here 's the location . About two hours southeast of here . In the middle of nowhere it looks like . They 'll be able to see you coming for miles . You 'll have to approach very carefully . Us ? What about you ? I thought you wanted revenge . I need to focus on saving my brother . He 's all I have left . Thanks to Jake , I think I have the final piece of the puzzle . Forward the map to my phone . Come on , buddy . Let 's go . I hope you find her . I shouldn 't even have to be looking for her . I figured it out , Will . I know what to do . The kid ... Jake ... his brain was ... amazing . I never knew where the right pathway was until today . Mr. Norburg , I thought that was you . Do you need anything ? Coffee . Lots of coffee . Okay . Maybe I 'll just call Dr. Whitman . Yeah , go ahead . Call whoever you 'd like . You know what they 're gonna say ? " Yes , Mr. Norburg , whatever you want , Mr. Norburg . Thank you for your generous donations , Mr. Norburg . " You work here ? - How old are you ? - 17 . I volunteer . I want to be a neurosurgeon when I grow up , so I got permission to ... I 'm sorry . You don 't care . Look , I know this probably looks kind of strange , but I know what I 'm doing . There 's an implant in my brother 's brain right here , you see ? Like they do for Parkinson 's patients . Very good . It fires electrical impulses , rerouting the synaptic pathways . My hope is that I can redirect all of his brain functions around the damaged areas . So he 'll be able to talk and move . Exactly . It 'll be like the accident never happened . Okay , it looks like we got about ten more miles on this road . Hey ... what 's that ? Open it . Yeah ? It was my mother 's . She left it to Amelia . You look happy . Well , I wasn 't always a deranged conspiracy theorist living out of my car . What did you do before ? You know , it 's funny . After everything that we 've been through , I don 't know the first thing about you . Well , I guess we know the important stuff , right ? But if you must know , I was in advertising . I wouldn 't have guessed that . There wasn 't a client in the world I couldn 't land , believe me . Yeah , I bet . 'Cause you were the most determined . - No , no , no , no , no . Please ! - What ? The engine 's boiling over . I hate this car . The pathway 's still open . We 're getting there . Motor test . Again . Flexion to pain . Localized response . That 's a five on the GCS . He-He 's never been more than a two . Okay . Moving on to the brain stem . This is the home stretch . Rapid eye movement , both eyes . He 's looking at me . It 's working . William ? He can hear me . What ... happened ? The garage is closed for the weekend . How 's she doing ? Not good . It 's gonna take at least an hour to cool down . - We don 't have an hour . - I know . Having some trouble ? Engine overheated . I could take you to the next town . They probably have a mechanic . We don 't have time for that . Actually , we 're trying to get here . Is there any chance you could give us a ride ? That 's 20 miles off the highway . It 'd probably put me way behind schedule . Hold on . I got 200 bucks . Yeah , I can do that . Hop in . Thanks . I 'll get Jake . - Watch your step . - Thanks so much , sir . Okay . Hey , buddy , come on . Why don 't we we put that back ? It 's not ours . I don 't mind . He 's just like my kid , curious about everything . She , uh , helps out at a hospital near where we live . Wants to be a doctor . She 's beautiful . When I was her age , I wanted to be a beach bum . Yeah , Evie practically grew up in a hospital . Mom had cancer . She passed last year . I 'm sorry . So many memories in that house . I miss Evie so bad , but every time I 'm home ... Well , there 's some times I feel like I 'm abandoning my kid by being away so often . I 'm so sorry . I know what you mean . I haven 't seen my daughter for three years , and if I had a choice in the matter ... I know , it 's just ... It 's been so long . What if she won 't talk to me ? Then you keep trying until she does , I guess . Have arrived in your destination . Oh , it snuck up on me . Here we are . Wherever here is . Look , I don 't feel right leaving you guys out here . No , we 'll be fine . Look , thank you very much for the ride . I wish you the best with your daughter . - Thank you . - Come on , Jake . Let 's go . This is the address . Where is it ? Jake ! Come on . She 's in there ? Yeah , with at least a dozen armed guards . Calvin was right . They 'll see us coming a half an hour before we even get there . If we spook them , they 'll just take her and run . Okay . So maybe we wait till nightfall . - Jake . - Jake . Jake , no , no . No . No , Jake , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Martin , they 're getting the Jeep . They 're gonna be here any minute ; we got to go . We got to run . We can 't outrun a Jeep . They 're gonna keep searching till they find someone . Wait .. that 's it . That 's what Jake wants ; He wants them to find me . That 's my way in . You stay hidden . You make sure that Jake 's safe . Hey , it 's okay , buddy . Help ! - Let 's get him . - Help ! Thank God . I 've been wandering around for hours . - Sir , you 're on private property . - I know . I 'm sorry , my car broke down a few miles back . I got turned around . Why don 't you get inside ? Thanks . Yeah . All right , let 's go . All I need is a phone , okay ? I can call a friend ; they 'll come pick me up . Whatever you guys are doing out here , I promise I won 't say a word . Get inside . - You can 't be serious . - Now . Fine . I don 't want a problem . I just want to get out of here . Can I at least get some water ? Hey , please , can I get some water ? I haven 't don 't anything wrong . My car broke down ! You can 't hold me like this ! How did you find us ? You . I thought you worked for Calvin . Sort of . Mostly I worked for his mother , t - taking care of Amelia . - Where is she ? - I can 't tell you . They 'll know that I helped you , and they 'll kill me . You 'll tell me where she is right now . Please , you don 't know what these people are capable of . Right now , you have no idea what I 'm capable of . Now , where is she ? She 's locked in a room on the other side of the building . Give me the keys . Show me . I 'm so sorry . Mom loved you more than anything . She was here every day , making sure you were comfortable . I remember her ... aria . Her voice ? She read to you . Yeah . Right , her voice . Words still jumbled . Yeah , a certain amount of aphasia , it 's normal , you know . You 'll get over it with time . Just be patient with yourself . What ... what was that game that she hated ? The one with the apples ? With the pillows ? Yeah . Y-You would make a big mountain out of cushions and then you would climb to the top , and then you 'd push it all over like an avalanche . And you would come and save me . Do you remember anything about the accident ? Yeah . It was ... a storm , and I was supposed to go on a railing ? - No , a ... - A flight . Yeah , you were going back to school in Connecticut . I had promised that I would get you to the airport on time . The rain was coming down really hard , and we were listening to the oldies station on the radio . And then you took a turn . And ... William ... I can 't tell you how sorry I am about the accident . It was my fault . You trusted me , and I ... And you 're still moving mountains to save me . Come on , before the guard comes back . Stay with me . I got to get you somewhere safe . Come on . We have to find some keys . Here . 6908 . Got it . Jake ? Jake ! Good idea . They can 't catch you if they can 't drive . Let 's go . Hey , it 's okay . We 're gonna get your dad , but we need ... Wait up . Her room 's just around the corner . Hold on , wait , wait . Don 't you move . Go . I know I locked it . Well , I didn 't let him out . Kase . Where are they ? Amelia . Don 't be frightened . My name is Martin Bohm . I 'm a friend of your mother 's . I know who you are . You 're Jake 's dad . We have to go . We don 't have much time . I 'll follow you . Show me the girl 's room . She 's gone . Where are they now ? I don 't know , sir . I 'm trying , - but every ... - Just find them . We 're never gonna make it . Shut up . Hold up . - I 'll check down this way . - Come here . Get back here . Is there another way out of here ? There 's seven possible exits , but no matter where we go , they 'll see where we 're going and cut us off . They have eyes everywhere . So we 're gonna have to blind them . Show me how . The circuits are ancient . We can overload the system . Here , you 're gonna need this . We 'll turn the lights on last - so no one will know where we are . - Okay . The servers . You can power them up from that computer over there . All right . They 're not in the south wing . Circle around east . They 're up . Are you ready ? Yeah . That 's Martin Bishop . Somebody get the power back on ! Immediately ! We need to get back to your mom and Jake . They 're not where you left them . I know where they are . We 're going to need a car . Damn it . Come on . Get down . I 'm in the garage . Copy . We 're heading out now . They won 't get far . Get to the back , now . Hey , someone 's been in here . The keys are gone . What do you mean , the keys are gone ? They 're gone . They 're not there . Come on . Stop , stop ! Stop here . I don 't see anything . Amelia , wait ! Amelia , get back in the car ! Mom ? Mom ... - Amelia ? - Mom ? Amelia ? Amelia ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! My baby ! My baby ! I 'm so sorry I couldn 't find you . My baby . Oh , my ... Lucy ! - Lucy , we gotta go now ! - Okay . Jake , get in the car ! Three of the teams radioed in . There 's no sign of them . Keep looking . Ms. Farington . You lost her . Yep , that 's right . The girl 's gone . But we found her once . I 'm sending Tanner . No , that is really not necessary . I 'm still in complete control of the operation . We 're taking a team out right now . We 're gonna find her . You leave me no choice . He 'll be there in 20 . That should do it . Thanks . Well , now that we 've got Amelia back , we 've got all the evidence we need . The cops can 't ignore us . Just got to find the right cops . So let 's do it . What do you want me to do ? I want you to disappear . - Why ? - Lucy , Guillermo Ortiz is still out there . It 's dangerous . It 's gonna take some time . Aster Corps is gonna use that time and all of their resources to try and find you and your daughter . You need to go somewhere that you 've never been before . Look , we could never imagine what your daughter 's been through . Disappear ... somewhere safe . Spend some time with her . Okay . So ... this is good-bye for real . No . I 'll see you soon enough . - You take care , Lucy . - I will . You kept it . Thank you . Give this to your dad . He 'll know what to do . Hey , guys . I 'm sorry to interrupt , but , Jake , we gotta go . Amelia , it 's a real pleasure to finally meet you . Come on , buddy . Bye , you . I 'll see you soon . Jake , we gotta go . Lucy ... - we 'll see you soon . - Bye . Let 's go . Mr. Norburg . Will ? Will ? Oh , no ! The old pathways must have been too strong . He regressed ! Why didn 't you wake me up ? ! - I-I didn 't know what to ... - Get out ! Will ! We each have a path . Some are forced apart , but flow back together , their synchronicity inescapable . Evie , honey ? Some paths touch only briefly , and glance off in different directions , forever changed by the meeting . Some loop back again and again , across time and space ... Mom always finding each other . You 're gonna have to get used to it , kid . I 'm gonna be hugging you and kissing you and staring at you while you sleep . I 'll be honest , it 's gonna be a little creepy . You 're so beautiful . I know , Mom . Oh , my God . Aster Corps . Once we 're on our path , there are limited chances to deviate , small moments when some other force comes into play , and knocks you off your trajectory . Ms. Farington , we 've spotted Lucy Robbins ' vehicle . Is Amelia with her ? Unclear . How should we proceed ? We only need the girl . The mother 's a liability . Get rid of her . Make it clean . It 's okay , honey . I 'm not gonna let them take you . I know . This car 's faster than it looks . Don 't worry . We turn around , they follow , they catch us in three minutes . You saw that ? - I see the paths , the possibilities . - Okay . So we off-road , and we 'll lose ' em in the desert . The axle breaks down in.23 miles . They catch us in six minutes . Is there any path where we escape ? No . Is there any path where you escape ? - Yeah . - But not me . No ... I run , you block them , and they ... Okay . It 's okay , baby . Okay ? No , I won 't leave you . Here 's what I need you to do , babe . I need you to go out to the desert , I need you to run as fast as you can , okay ? Whatever happens , wherever I am , I promise I 'll be watching you , okay ? I love you . Okay , go ! Run . Run as fast as you can , okay ? Run ! What could be powerful enough to change your path , change your future ? An act of nature . An act of love . Where 's the girl ? What girl ? Look , I don 't know who the hell you are ... I 'm her mother . Once this deviation happens , you find yourself on a new path , uncharted , unknown ... and stretching out ahead of you .

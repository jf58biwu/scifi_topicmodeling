 CLARKE : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air , or floated in the water . Ripped By mstoll ( YELLING ) None of us have . For three generations , the Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind . One hundred prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive . But we will be tested , by the Earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of alt , by each other . Previously on The 100 ... The Ark is dying , Raven . I have to prove that Earth is survivable . We have nine days to get this ready so I can survive a drop . My father , he begged for mercy when your father floated him . This is for my father . ( GRUNTING ) You 're Charlotte , right ? It 's okay to be scared . Do you want to talk about it ? It 's my parents . They were floated and I see it in my dreams . - No ! - Wake up , Charlotte . Does it happen often ? Slay your demons , kid . Then you 'll be able to sleep . ( BIRDS FLUTTER ) Sorry . ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) You shouldn 't be out here alone . What if I was a Grounder ? They got Wells just outside the wall . Says the guy who just spent another night exploring the woods all by himself . But I 'm reckless , irresponsible . I got you something . Where did you get this ? The an supply store . I know when we were kids Wells was always giving me ink , charcoal . Just anything I could draw with , really . I found out later that he was trading his own stuff to give it to me . He didn 't want me to know that , either . He let me hate him so that I wouldn 't hate my mother . I know . My mother killed my father . I just wish there was something I could do . To tell her I know . Make her feel what I 'm ... Where are you going ? To make her feel it . ( ALARM SOUNDING ) No ! No . No . Hell no . No . No . This isn 't right . Abby . No . Abby . Okay . It 's not conclusive . Just because her wristband went out doesn 't mean ... Okay . It 's the first terminated signal in over a week . We can still assume that things are stabilizing on Earth . We should assume that . I need an analysis of Clarke 's vital signs for the past two days . - Abby . - Just have it ready for me when I get back . ( DOOR HISSES ) Yes ! I did it . It 's still operational . ( CHATTER IN DISTANCE ) What ? Monty needed a working wristband . And you needed to punish your mother . Look , they 're running out of air , and we need their help . My mother thinking I 'm dead is only temporary . Not if I can 't patch it through the dropship mainframe . I can do it . We 'll be talking to the Ark by nightfall . This section should be finished by tomorrow . Hey ! You think the Grounders are just gonna sit around and wait for us to finish the wall ? Maybe we should lei the little girl do the lifting for you , huh ? I just need some water , okay ? Then I 'll be fine . Murphy , get this guy some water . Hey. you got this ? I 'm just kidding . ( UNZIPS PANTS ) ( URINATING ) Ugh ! What the hell is wrong with you , Murphy ? I 'm gonna kill you ! You wanted a water break . Get back to work . MAN : You heard him ! Look , we 're already there . Just a few steps , okay ? One foot in front of the other . Hey . What 's wrong ? Oh , nothing . I 'm good . Jasper , it 's been a week , okay ? You 've been given a second chance . You gotta use it . Aah ! ( MUFFLED SCREAMS ) Octavia ? Octavia ? Octavia ! Octavia , are you okay ? MAN : Aah ! Hey , jerk ! Get the hell out of here . Jasper , come on . There 's nothing to be afraid of . ( CHATTER ) Councillor . Are you headed to Mecha Station ? Yes , as a matter of fact , I am . You 've been down there nine times in the past week . Is there something I should be made aware of ? Are you tracking me , Kane ? I 'm tracking everybody , Abby . Mind if I join you ? Not at all . But you 're gonna have to be inoculated . Inoculated ? A mechanic came down with strep last week . She 's fine now , but I 'm still checking the bacterial levels in the station . We don 't want another outbreak . We can stop by sick bay on the way . That 's all right . I don 't want to slow you down . Just keep me informed . Absolutely . ( WHIRRING ) How soon can you get this thing ready to drop ? I 'm still scraping up parts to fabricate a pressure regulator . We got two more days , right ? Can we launch without that part ? We could launch , but we 'll be dead before we get to the ground . And I mean bad dead . Ruptured lungs , air bubbles in the brain . We need that part . Why ? What 's wrong ? Did something change ? Clarke 's wristband signal went out . Yeah , but that doesn 't mean anything , right ? She took it off like the rest of them . Okay . I can get a pressure regulator . Today . How ? The less you know , the better . This knife was made of metal from the dropship . What do you mean ? Who else knows about this ? No one . We brought it straight here . Clarke ? It means the Grounders didn 't kill Wells . It was one of us . So , there 's a murderer in the camp ? There 's more than one murderer in this camp . This isn 't news . We need to keep it quiet . - Get out of my way , Bellamy . - Be smart about this . Look at what we 've achieved . The wall , the patrols . Like it or not , thinking the Grounders killed Wells is good for us . Oh , good for you , you mean . What ? Keep people afraid and they 'll work for you ? - Is that it ? - Yeah , that 's it . But it 's good for all of us . Fear of the Grounders is building that wall . And besides , what are you gonna do , just walk out there and ask the killer to step forward ? You don 't even know whose knife that is . Oh , really ? J.M. John Murphy . The people have a right to know . No water till this section is up ! What ? What are you starting at , huh ? You son of a bitch ! - What 's your problem ? Recognize this ? It 's my knife . Where 'd you find it ? Where you dropped it after you killed Wells . Where I what ? The Grounders killed Wells , not me . I know what you did , and you 're gonna pay for it . Really ? Bellamy , you really believe this crap ? You threatened to kill him . We all heard you . You hated Wells . Plenty of people hated Wells . His father was the chancellor that locked us up . Yeah , but you 're the only one who got in a knife fight with him . Yeah , I didn 't kill him then , either . - Tried to kill Jasper , too . - What ? Come on . This is ridiculous . I don 't have to answer to you . I don 't have to answer to anyone . Come again ? Bellamy , look , I 'm telling you , man . I didn 't do this . They found his fingers on the ground with your knife . Is this the kind of society that we want ? You say there should be no rules . Does that mean that we can kill each other without punishment ? I already told you . I didn 't kill anyone . I say we float him . MAN : Yeah . That 's not what I 'm saying . Why not ? He deserves to float . It 's justice . Revenge isn 't justice . It 's justice . Float him ! ( CHANTING " FLOAT HIM " ) No ! Get off him ! Okay . Get off of him ! I didn 't do anything ! Let him go ! CLARKE : You can 't do this ! Get off me . No ! You can stop this ! They 'll listen to you ! Bellamy ! You should do it . Bel-la-my ! ( CHANTING " BEL-LA-MY " ) I saw you in the woods with Atom . I know you 're not a killer . Bellamy , don 't do this . Don 't . Bellamy . ( CHANTING CONTINUES ) You can 't do this , Bellamy . ( MUFFLED SPEAKING ) No , Bellamy , no ! This is on you , princess . You should 've kept your mouth shut . What the hell are you doing ? Cut him down ! Charlotte , get out of here now ! Cut him down ! Get out of my way . Stop ! Okay ? Murphy didn 't kill Wells ! - I did ! - Oh , my God . ( GASPS ) - it 's not meal time yet . - I 'm not hungry . I 'm here to trade . Before you tell me I 'm in the wrong place , just let Nygel know it 's her little bird . WOMAN : Well , well , well . How long has it been , little bird ? I need a pressure regulator . What for ? Regulating pressure . That 's good . I see you got your mom 's sense of humor . What do you want for it ? I don 't move machine parts anymore . It 's too dangerous . How about settling for some herb and moonshine like everybody else ? Save the act for someone who doesn 't know better . Just tell me what it 's gonna take . I owe a favor to the chief of electrical , and he 's got a thing for tough , pretty girls like you . You 're joking , right ? I never joke about business , Raven . Kane 's watching my every move , so , if I 'm gonna do this , you 're gonna need to make it worth my while . By screwing the chief of electrical ? I can 't do that . Then I guess you don 't need to regulate pressure as badly as you thought you did . Go float yourself , Nygel . You know , your mother would 've taken that deal . In fact , she did . Many times . Don 't you dare talk about my mother that way ! - Little girl . - No ! I 'll float you , Nygel ! Get off me ! Bye , little bird ! Bring out the girl , Bellamy ! BELLAMY : Why , Charlotte ? I was just trying to slay my demons , like you told me . What the hell is she talking about ? She misunderstood me . Charlotte , that is not what I meant . MURPHY ( OUTSIDE ) : Bring the girl out now ! Please don 't let them hurt me . If you guys have any bright ideas , speak up . - Now you stay quiet . - Those are your boys out there . This is not my fault . If she had listened to me , those idiots would still be building the wall . MURPHY : You want to build a society , princess ? Let 's build a society . Bring her out . No ! Please , Bellamy . Charlotte , hey , it 's gonna be okay . Just stay with them . Well , well . Look who decided to join us . Dial it down and back off . Or what ? What are you gonna do , Bellamy , hang me ? I was just giving the people what they wanted . Yeah . Yeah , that 's a good idea . Why don 't we do that right now ? So , who here wants to see the real murderer hung up ? All in favor ? I see . So , it 's okay to string me up for nothing , but when this little bitch confesses , you wanna let her walk ? - Cowards ! All of you are cowards ! - Hey , Murphy ! Murphy . It 's over . Whatever you say , boss . WOMAN : Son of a bitch ! Hey ! Come on . Let 's get the girl . Charlotte ! Charlotte , I know you can hear me ! And when I find you , you are gonna pay ! ( CHATTER , BABY CRYING ) ( COUGHS ) Come on . I 'll be right back . All those people out there ? Oxygen deprivation . It 's just the beginning . Why are you here ? I messed up . I can 't get the part . - Nygel wants me to- - - You went to Nygel ? Yeah . Kane 's been trying to get her for years . Did anybody see you ? I don 't know . No . Abby , I 'm trying to tell you . We can 't launch today . Are you sure Nygel has the part ? - She can get one , yeah . - Okay . I 'll take care of it . What are you gonna do ? The less you know , the better . WOMAN ( OVER PA ) : Attention . Ration station will close In 15 minutes . Hello , Dr. Griffin . Nygel . Morphine . What do you want for it ? Pressure regulator . I underestimated Raven . How does a girl like that get such a well-connected benefactor ? You have three seconds to decide . Do we have a deal or not ? WOMAN ( OVER PA ) : Attention . The mess hall will be closed tomorrow from 1100 hours to 1200 hours . It 's gonna be night soon , Finn . Where are we going ? At least tell me you have a plan and we 're not just wandering aimlessly through the woods . I have a plan . What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Just because we saved you doesn 't mean you 're forgiven . Got it ? Clarke . What ? She 's just a kid . She 's a killer . You killed someone , Charlotte . Ended his life . Did you stop to think about that for even one second ? Look at me ! You can 't just kill someone to make yourself feel better . ( BIRD CAWING ) MURPHY : Charlotte ! Clarke and Finn can 't save you . We should run . Yeah , that 's one way to go . I like my plan better . Get in . Get in . Get in . Finn , what is this place ? For now , it 's home . CLARKE : I can 't believe you kept this place quiet . Come on , Clarke . What would be the point of telling anybody ? Some of this stuff could be useful . Like what ? There 's no weapons . All the food expired , like , 90 years ago . Yeah , but we could repurpose . Share with the group . You can share this with the group if you 'd like . Heh . What 'd you find ? Well ... Looks like they never made it here . No . I figure the bombs took them by surprise . All this preparation . What a waste . I don 't know . Maybe they were lucky . They couldn 't have lived more than a few years down here , then when they ran out of food or lost their minds , they would 've opened the doors and been dead within a few days . Back then , maybe sooner . Anyway . CLARKE : What are we gonna do about her ? If I hadn 't confronted Murphy , none of this would have happened . How could you know it 'd go down like that ? Bellamy knew . We think the Grounders are a threat . Now we 're killing each other . There have to be consequences . We can 't just let them hang people . No . Hopefully , we figure it out before Murphy kills us for helping her . He 's not the forgive and forget type . - How did you- - - Don 't worry about it . How fast can you install it ? I don 't know . A few hours , maybe . We may not have that much time . I 'm on it . ( RATTLING ) WOMAN : Our ancestors built this Ark to be our salvation , but it 's also our test . But we endure because we have faith . Faith that one day , generations from now , our people will return to the ground . Are you here to join us ? He 's hereto see me , Vera . Go on with your mumbo-jumbo . Your mother 's inspired today , Marcus . I remember when you were the tender of the tree . You were a cute kid . VERA : Let 's begin the offering . Why did you bring me down here , Nygel ? What do you want ? It 's about what you want . I have something for you . Unless is a signed confession , I 'm not interested . Not even if it involves your friend Abby Griffin ? What about Abby ? She and a girl named Raven Reyes asked me to get them a pressure regulator . As a lowly culinary tech , I didn 't feel I had a choice when one of your fellow councillors asked me to help her break the law . ( EXHALES SHARPLY ) And since when do you give up your customers ? I don 't have customers , Marcus . I am a citizen of the Ark , and I don 't believe anyone should be above the law . Do you ? You 're a plague on this ship , Nygel . And even if what you said is true , it 's your word against a member of the council , and who do you think the people will believe ? You know , you should thank me . With Abby out the way , your agenda should sail right through . I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 're almost as convincing as your mother . As the Earth will one day provide for us , so we provide for the Earth . Waste of water if you ask me . Not to them . ( CLICK ) Finn . Finn , wake up . She 's gone . ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) ( PANTING ) ( SCREAMING ) Shh ! Shh . ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) MAN 1 : Charlotte ! You can 't hide forever . MAN 2 : Don 't worry . We won 't hurt you . Let me go ! I 'm trying ... Hey , hey . I 'm trying to help you . I 'm not your sister ! Just stop helping me ! I 'm over here ! Are you trying to get us both killed ? Just go , okay ? I 'm the one they want . Okay , Charlotte , listen to me . I won 't leave you . Please , Bellamy . ( GASPS , SCREAMS ) Murphy ! I 'm over here ! Come on out , Charlotte ! Come on out . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Someone else was here . - CHARLOTTE : No , no ! Murphy ! - Murphy has her . ( RATCHET TURNING ) Abby , how about I pace in the operating room next time you 're working ? ( COMMUNICATOR BEEPING ) Abby , did you take morphine from the clinic ? They inventoried already ? No . Kane was just here . He 's on his way to Mecha to arrest both of you right now . You gave Nygel morphine ? She turned me in . How much longer ? Twenty minutes . They 're gonna be here in five . No matter what happens , you launch that pod . Do you understand ? I 'm not going without you . Only one of us needs to get to the ground , Raven . The second you find those kids , you radio back . Three hundred innocent people will die if you don 't . Abby , they 'll float you . Heh . Then they 'll float me . ( SIGHS ) Tell Clarke I love her . ( CHARLOTTE SCREAMS ) Charlotte ! Put me down ! Charlotte ! Damn it . Bellamy ! You cannot fight all of us . Give her up . Maybe not , but I guarantee I 'll take a few of you with me . Bellamy ! Stop ! This has gone too far . Just calm down . We 'll talk about this . I 'm sick of listening to you talk . - Let her go . - I will slit her throat . No , please . Please don 't hurt her . Don 't hurt her ? Okay , I 'll make you a deal . You come with me right now , I will let her go . Don 't do it , Charlotte . Don 't do it , Charlotte ! No ! No , I have to ! BELLAMY : Murphy , this is not happening . I can 't let any of you get hurt anymore . Not because of me . Not after what I did . Charlotte ! No ! Ne , no ! No ! ( CLARKE SOBBING ) Oh ... Bellamy . ( YELLING ) Bellamy . Bellamy , stop ! You 'll kill him ! Get off me ! He deserves to die . No ! We don 't decide who lives and dies . Not down here . So help me God , if you say the people have a right to decide- - No , I was wrong before , okay ? You were right . Sometimes it 's dangerous to tell people the truth . But if we 're gonna survive down here , we can 't just live by whatever the hell we want . We need rules . And who makes those rules , huh ? You ? For now , we make the rules . Okay ? What , then ? We just take him back and pretend like it never happened ? No ! ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) We banish him . Get up . Bellamy ! Stop ! If I ever catch you near camp , we 'll be back here . Understand ? As for the four of you , you can come back and follow me , or go off with him to die . Your choice . Come on ! ( HISSES , BREAKS ) No ! Damn it ! She gave us a bad part . I 'm hoping there 's a logical explanation for all this . My daughter . I know . I 'm sorry . We all knew it was a long shot . I still believe . What 's the pressure regulator for , Abby ? There 's no bacteria , is there ? Your infected mechanic , Raven Reyes . What 's she up to ? ( METALLIC THUD ) ( WHIRRING ) Did you know that her boyfriend , Finn Collins , was one of the hundred ? Your obsession is now gonna get her floated , too . ( CLICKING , BEEPING ) ( WHIRRING ) If you don 't tell me what you 're up to , I won 't be able to save her . You still don 't understand . I 'm trying to save all of us . Arrest her . Continue to search for Raven Reyes . Sir . ( EXPLOSION ) ( ALARM SOUNDING ) What was that ? Sir , a pod launched . Abby ... What have you done ? We have to know the truth . That 's why we 've decided to banish him from camp . Anybody got a problem with that ? ( ALARM CONTINUES SOUNDING ) Will we be able to talk to them ? No . More like Morse code . You want to do the honors ? That port right there . MAN : Whew . CLARKE : Aah ! Whoa . ( ALARM SOUNDING ) What the hell ? What happened ? It didn 't work . I think we fried all the wristbands . Sit there at your own risk . I think I might be cursed . Then call me a risk taker . And , Jasper , you 're not cursed . I 'm lucky then . No . Brave . Brave ? ( SCOFFS ) For getting my face bashed in or for ruining any chance to contact the Ark ? No , for standing up to a bully and trying to help everyone . Yeah . And failing . Both times . I didn 't see anyone else step up . Did you ? And I don 't care how things turned out . You were brave to try . And bravery is always rewarded . CLARKE : Finn ! Finn , stop it ! Calm down ! We 're dead to them ! Don 't you get that ? No , there 's still hope . Even you don 't believe that . It 's over , Clarke . They 're gonna die up there , and we 're alone . We 're not alone ! You 're not alone . You 're not alone . ( WHIRRING ) Ripped By mstoll ( English US - SDH )

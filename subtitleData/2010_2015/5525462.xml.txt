 Olivia Dunham , FBI . These two men are consultants . Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop . You are looking through a window into another world . An alternate universe just like ours . And in each of them , there is a version of us . Agent Dunham , Agent Lee . Whatever 's happening between the two universes whatever our fate is , I 'm at the center of it . I love you . I was never good at letting you go . This time , you have to . I understand what the machine does . Our two worlds are inextricable . If one side dies , we all die . So I 've torn holes in both universes and they lead here , a bridge so that we can begin to work together to fix ... They don 't remember Peter . How could they ? He never existed . He served his purpose . This isn 't gonna work , this truce , because you 're not trustworthy in simple things like principles , honor , honesty . All fundamental requirements in an accord . If you can 't trust the people you 're dealing with , what then ? You know , maybe I 'm not the problem . Maybe it 's you . Maybe you are just incapable of trust . Interesting , coming from the person who kidnapped me and stole my life . Heh . You know , being you , living your life only made me more homesick for my universe . Must be hard to develop trust in people when all you 've got is yourself . Must get terribly lonely . Just because you walked in my shoes , don 't you think that you know me . Yeah , keep telling yourself that . Happy reading . I 'm sure you 'll find a lot of the cases familiar since your people were responsible . Heh . Funny , I was just gonna say the same thing to you . All the leaves are brown And the sky is gray And the sky is gray I 've been for a walk I 've been for a walk I received your message . Then you know we have a problem . It is impossible . The timeline has been rewritten . He was erased . California dreamin And yet traces of him continue to bleed through . It is , as it has always been our responsibility to ensure events play out as they were intended before your intervention . This started with you . It must be you who ends it . They can never know the boy lived to be a man . I will take care of it . I 'm ready . Toaster was acting up . Then don 't eat toast . You ever heard of cereal ? - Lincoln . - Oh , she got me . Unh . Lincoln , why don 't you like toast ? I like toast , but , you see , toast takes time . If too much time goes by , we don 't catch any bad guys . If we don 't catch the bad guys , there might not be any toast . So it 's your dad who must not like toast . Wanna see a frog ? - Hmm ... - Jonathan . One more time , pick up that backpack and get going . Toaster was late . I 'm a victim in this . - Oh , my God . - Hi , Lincoln . - Jules . - All right , come on , let 's go . - Did you eat ? - I did . - Early , like Robert was supposed to . - Hmm . They did a study on sarcastic people . They get more illnesses in their lifetime . - Is that right ? - Something to do with negative energy . - Bye , Dad . - Love you . - Love you . - Bye , Lincoln . You ever wonder where you 'd be without me ? - Put your pants on . - Don 't worry . We 're not gonna be late . Don 't move . Robert , he 's down ! Robert . Hey . Robert . - Go ahead . - Dr. Bishop , it 's me . I 'm at the bod ... Oh , God . Where 's the victim 's partner ? That 's him there . That 's Agent Lee . Great . Thank you . Agent Lee ? Olivia Dunham . - He used to know her . - Yes . Before things changed . I understand that you and your partner were in pursuit of a suspect . We were tracking the sale of some illegal weapons . I was hoping to ask you some questions about what you saw . Sure . Who are you ? I 'm from a special division . I 'm not at liberty to disclose any more than that . So the person who attacked your partner , can you describe him ? When I first got there , he was , uh ... He was kneeling over Robert . I couldn 't tell what he was doing , but his skin was , um translucent . It 's like what you see on Robert 's face , but more of it . When he was kneeling over Agent Danzig did you see anything in his hand ? - A device that could have done this ? - No , I didn 't see anything . I 've requested our field office ME . He 's on the way . He 's good . He 's thorough . Thank you , but we 're going to take the remains back to our facility . Wait a minute . You 're telling me ... - That 's my partner . - I understand how you feel . You 're some division coming in here and taking over . - You won 't tell me who you are ? - This case will take top ... Have you seen the suspect before ? Do you know who he is ? - I 'm not at liberty to discuss ... - This is my partner we 're talking about . Maybe you can 't understand that . - I 'd like to talk to someone else . - There is no one else . There is just me . I am sorry for your loss . Maybe it 's the air . Have you checked the temperature ? It is exactly the same as it always is , Walter 72 degrees and 10 percent humidity . Maybe the barometric pressure . You can 't tell me there 's not something different in here . This whole place has felt funny for the last week . Since we agreed to work with the Other Side . That 's another thing . That man cannot be trusted . I don 't care what he says . I have looked into his eyes , into his soul . And who would know him better than me ? Don 't forget , Walter , he has plenty of reasons to hate you too . I know you 're not happy about this but we 're supposed to be going through these case files . Fine , I 'll help you with the case files as soon as I 'm done here but don 't expect me to like it . All I 'm saying , and I 've been very consistent about this is that there has to be another way . The thing about playing devil 's advocate is that your client is the devil himself . Walter , we 're fixing the world . What other choice do we have ? Thank God that machine didn 't blow everybody up . You know , it could have . - Excuse me . - Here , hold this . - I 'm looking ... - Shh , shh , shh . Three , two , one ... Walter , you brought it back to life . No , no , no . It 's still quite dead . Wonderful , isn 't it ? Who are you people ? What the hell are you doing here ? Hmm . There 's still a few kinks to work out but it 's a start . Tapping into traffic cameras without a warrant . You and whoever helped you with this is in a lot of trouble . You are not a part of this investigation . You need to leave . I 've spent two hours going building-to-building . I am not leaving here without some answers . What division are you in ? What are we dealing with here ? - Hello . - I 'll give your division head a call . I see . It 's good to know we have reception . I have a friend at The New York Times who 'd love to know that there 's a division of the FBI operating out of Harvard with a man who can make dead birds fly . It 's for you . It 's Broyles . If you really want a story , you should look under the dome . I 'm growing an ear . - There 's another body . Let 's go . - I 'm coming with you . You 're gonna talk yourself out of the bureau . I was at the first crime scene . Maybe I saw something I haven 't told you yet . Maybe that 's why I came here . All right , come . You can get fired later . - Hey , Walter , where 's the ... ? - Here . I fixed the squelching . It should be fine now . Thank you . So , what do we have ? - One female , approximately 30 years old . - Any witnesses ? Eh , there were some people on the street over there , some kids . Anybody see what happened after the crash ? No . But we should have some background on her by now . Okay . Walter ? Walter , are you there ? He rocks in the treetops Walter ? Hello ? Walter . - Walter , can you hear me ? - I 'm here . The microwave was causing a disturbance . I can hear you perfectly . You 're as clear as a bell . - How 's the squelching ? - Sounds great . I 'd like to see the body . Chop-chop . Don 't let that ham-fist touch her . Uh , if you don 't mind holding off a moment , I 'd like to just do a preliminary . Burn marks like the other victims . Pupils are dilated . That looks like a hematoma on her right clavicle . Yeah , and her right jaw . Hmm . Rigidity indicates premature rigor mortis . I 'll need to check her anus . Have that large lady there help you lift her . I 'm going to , uh ... Gonna need to check her anus . Okay . Thank you . So , what do we know about her ? Her name was Nadine Park . She was a commuter . She parked her car at the train station four blocks from here at 10 : 45 this morning . She was still behind the wheel so maybe he was waiting for her in the backseat . He wanted to attack her when there was no one else around . She struggled for a bit and then hit the lamppost . - They all said they didn 't see anything ? - That 's right . One of these things is not like the other . Hi , I 'm Agent Dunham . Hi . What 's your name ? Olivia . How do you like that ? That 's my name too . - Did you see the crash ? - I heard it . Did you see anything after the crash ? Your friends were out in the field , but you were here on the street . I was kind of hoping that maybe you saw something that they didn 't . - I don 't wanna get in trouble . - You 're not gonna get in trouble . I promise . I was talking to my boyfriend . I came out to the street to get reception . What did you see ? - Now we have a picture . Nice catch . - Thanks . Imagine what I could do with more information . A freaky see-through killer , two apparently unrelated murders ... It 's not just two . Agent Lee , I 'm Agent Phillip Broyles . What are these ? The first one raises your clearance . The second , you acknowledge you 'll be prosecuted if you speak about what we see here . The first attacks were three days ago . All we know is their hearts stopped . All of these in three days . We don 't know what happened what he does to affect their skin , and what he 's getting out of this . There must be a link between the victims , but we can 't find it . Different ages , races , blood types . Some had high cholesterol , some didn 't . - Cholesterol levels ? - We 're looking for anything . Robert had Crohn 's disease . He took iron pills . We were partners for five years . He was like family . Something I never thought I 'd find . He believed that everything happened for a reason . I 'm having a hard time believing that there 's a reason for this . I think I found what you 're looking for . Electron gun from a ' 58 color RCA . Had to take apart the cathode-ray tube to get to it so I 'm gonna have to charge you full price for the TV . Yes . I will take this as well . Mind my asking what you need all this stuff for ? I need to erase someone from time . Just there is great , guys . Thank you . Hey , have you seen Walter ? I went out to get him a sandwich . When I got back , he was gone . Well , where would he go ? He 's afraid to leave the lab . Maybe he locked himself in the bathroom again ? - I 'll check Gene 's stall . - Okay . Walter ? Is it safe to come out ? Is he gone ? - Who ? - The man ! - Is he gone ? - I don 't know . It 's just me and Agents Dunham and ... There was ... There was a man in the mirror . And when I turned around , he wasn 't there . I saw him . - Walter . - Astrid , there was a man in the mirror . If you 're talking about Agent Lee , you met him earlier . Not him ! It was another man . He was here , and then he was gone . I saw him . Walter , Walter , it 's okay . Look , whatever it was , we 're all here now and you 're okay . You 're okay . Walter , look at you , you 're soaking wet . We gotta get you out of those clothes . Is he all right ? Well , that depends on your definition of " all right . " He 's functional , except when he 's not . But he is often quite brilliant . He just never had anything to tether him to the world . It is sad . What is ? Engagement ring . I don 't think there 's anything sadder than when two people are meant to be together and something intervenes . Hey , Walter , it 's okay . It 's okay . It 's just your test results . - Question , dear . - Hmm ? - That man ? - Agent Lee . I believe it was your idea , Agent Lee to test each of the victims for iron-related diseases that they may share that in common . Very clever . Wrong , but clever . Well , it was just a long shot . And yet , interestingly , they do all suffer from a variety of health problems . Gout , hair loss , kidney diseases which in themselves have something in common . I 'm not wearing pants . I 'm on it . Which is what , Walter ? They 're all caused by some form of heavy metal poisoning . Lead , zinc , mercury . - Thank you , dear . - And what could that possibly mean ? I don 't know . But with 30-odd victims , it 's unlikely that it 's a coincidence . And something else , the levels of metal in their bodies have returned to normal . It 's as if their blood has been cleaned . So you 're saying he 's taking particles from their blood ? Why ? For what possible reason ? I don 't have enough information to form a hypothesis yet . But it would seem he needs a lot of it . If Walter 's right , and we assume he 's selecting these victims on purpose then the question is , how is he identifying them ? Tissue 's soft , no induration . Fat to lean muscle ratio ideal , about 20 percent . - Is that relevant ? - To this case ? Not at all . Just means that she 'll make a lovely specimen . Finding healthy tissue for experimentation is harder than you might imagine . You aren 't returning these people to their families ? - We can 't do that . - Why not ? Because we can 't disclose how they were killed . The families are informed that they have gone missing . - That we will continue to look for them ... - You mean you lie to them . - I 'm sorry ... - You understand what you 're saying ? Those families are going to spend their lives wondering what happened to their loved ones . Looking for answers . Can you imagine what that would be like ? To have that ... That hole in your life . People die . It happens . Sometimes they even die twice . The reason we can 't return the bodies is because that would mean we 'd have to file documentation which would draw attention to Fringe Division and we cannot have that . It may not be a good enough answer , but it is the truth . Listen to this . One of the victim 's credit cards just registered a charge . Dead people do not use their credit cards . Of course they do . Certainly . - So you think it 's the Translucent Man ? - Mm-hm . Can you track it ? Never mind , it 's a false alarm . It 's a commuter pass being auto-renewed as a monthly charge . The killer picked up his last victim in the commuter rail parking lot . We were wrong . The pattern 's not random at all . Four kill zones , all centered around commuter rail stations . Astrid , call Broyles . Lee , you come with me . Tell him to get that photograph out to the police . We 're gonna need three teams of agents to watch the stations . Where are we going ? Team 1 , nothing to report . Team 2 , all quiet here . Team 3 , same . No sign of the suspect . Just so you know I know what it 's like . I lost a partner too . About three years ago . There was an event on a plane and at first we thought it was terrorism . During the investigations , my partner was injured . What happened to him was horrific and unexplainable . It affected his skin . Like your partner , but different . And Walter Bishop was in a mental institution at the time . I checked him out so that he could help catch whoever did this and save my partner 's life . But even Walter couldn 't save him . This is Roach , we 've got him . Grove Hall Station . He 's headed for the industrial line , by the chemical lab . - I lost him . I lost him . - There . He 's running towards the warehouse ... - ... through the rail line . - Copy , we 're almost there . What if he goes out the other side ? - You take the near side ... Unh . No ! - Frazier ! Frazier 's down ! He 's been shot . He 's gonna bleed out if we don 't get him help . Go . Check the warehouse . If he 's still here , don 't let him get away . I got this . Don 't move . Drop it . Drop ... Unh . - Hey . - Yeah . - It took ... - It 's okay . You 're okay , an ambulance is on the way . - It took my gun . - It 's okay , it 's all over . There 's more than one . Who are these things ? What were they looking for ? I think the better question is , what are they ? Anything ? Nothing that I can make sense of . It 's all too badly burned . The Spy Who Came in From the Cold . We used to have the book , at St. Claire 's ... - ... the mental hospital where I lived for ... - Seventeen years . What about the book , Walter ? I used to read it every Wednesday . This reminds me of the book . The spy burning his things , covering his tracks . Agent Lee . Did you happen to bring candy ? Gumdrops , perhaps ? Uh , candy ? Um , no . That 's a pity . Astrid , where are the scalpels ? Long drive . Hope the bureau 's not gonna give you a hard time about putting miles on their car . I wanted to thank you for releasing Robert 's body . I know you must have pulled some significant strings . Why would you do that for me ? I know you haven 't found the answers you were looking for yet but I hope that it brings a kind of closure . A closure that he deserves . Because of what he meant to you . Thank you . Well , have a look at this . Does this remind you of anything ? Biological-mechanical hybrid . These are different , they 're human . And for whatever reason , they don 't work . - Are you suggesting that these are ... ? - I told you . I told you that man couldn 't be trusted . What is he talking about ? Don 't jump to conclusions . We don 't know that for sure . What I do know is that this tech isn 't from here . Not from here ? You mean like China ? No , not China . Sergeant . - I need an ID for Agent Lincoln Lee . - Yes , ma 'am . Place your hand right here , please , sir . - Badge number ? - BMP-12-2298 . Blood type ? Uh , B-positive . - Are you currently on any medications ? - No . Do you have a history of mental illness ? This is getting oddly personal , but , uh , no . Thank you , sir . Thank you . Just wait . Initiate scan . What is this ? Please remain still . What you said before ... I know what 's it like to have a hole in my life . It 's been there as long as I can remember . I told you about the incident on the plane . After that , Broyles asked us to join Fringe Division . And somehow I knew that this is where I would find ... What ? My answers . What 's beyond the door ? Well , sometimes answers lead to more questions . Heard you got something to show me . What is it ? It was powering a new form of shapeshifters . Shapeshifters ? Human shapeshifters . The ones we 've encountered before answered to Walternate . And you were wondering why I don 't trust you . I 'll look into it . - Night , Dr. Bishop . - Night , Tommy . - It 's Tim , sir . - Night , Timmy . I saw him again , the man . I saw him . He was in the TV . It was the man from the mirror .

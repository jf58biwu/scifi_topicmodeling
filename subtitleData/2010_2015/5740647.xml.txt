 The last fragment of a once living planet . Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants , while its head was cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space , screaming in pain and sorrow . In legend and in fact , it is known as Metal Hurlant . Alaria , my sweet daughter . You 're so pale and trembling . What is happening to you ? Living on this ship . Trapped within these metal walls . I can 't take it much longer . So bitter ... Is the taste of defeat . Alaria . It 's true the Lagyvirths have won the battle . They may have taken our planet , but not the galaxy . This is far from over . We will find allies . Everything is so cold . I can barely feel my skin . Can 't ... Even move . Fight it , daughter of mine . I beg of you . Don 't give into it . Have we not suffered enough ? I beg your forgiveness , King Targot . But you know what ails your daughter . She suffers from the sickness d 'Avsara . The " Curse of the Cold , " which has killed the majority of your subjects , and left us open to invasion . It is more aggressive than usual . Almost as if it was accelerated . Then , what can we do ? Only the fruit the Lacimar which grows on our lost planet is the cure . Maybe if I offered myself to the Lagyvirths , she might be saved . I fear the L 'Acimar would be useless . Her symptoms are so far advanced . Then , she is doomed ? I know one who can help . Holgarth . The master techno wizard . He can save her . Holgarth ? Then , she is doomed . Holgarth is a great alchemist . The very fact he 's lived over a hundred years shows he knows how to prolong life . The problem is not his ability , but his location . We no longer have any trace of him , since he left the fleet . Only rumors . I don 't care where he is , or what I have to go through . I will find him , and bring back the cure for the princess . Khondor ... You have protected me ... For as long as I can remember . You 're my most trusted and loyal servant . Tell me the truth . How much time do I have left ? One month , my princess . Not more . I 've witnessed the horrors of the war . I 've lost my beloved land , and almost all my people . I 've yet to experience to fall in love . To lie with a man . To bring a child into this world . It seems I am destined to die ... Having never truly lived . No , sweet Alaria . I 've sworn my life to protect you , and it has not changed . I will save you . And how will you achieve that ? My fleet is totally destroyed . I need no fleet . No soldiers . My King ... I prefer to travel alone . Khondor . The people 's love for their princess is the only thing that keeps them united . If she was to be lost , Alaria 's death would provoke a mass suicide . I swear on the blood of the Okmers , I 'll protect the people . May the gods hear you . Soldier Jari . I need some information . Khondor , I 'm very pleased you 've survived . How can I help ? You oversee all requests to leave the fleet . When Holgarth left , six cycles ago , Did he go through all the proper channels ? Yes . Of course . Need to find him . Urgently . Can you tell me where he went ? Let me see ... It was me who processed him . I remember him being very talkative . He was very excited to try something new . Yes . Here it is . In the destination notes . He was negotiating to buy a lunar station from someone from the UMA colonies . He was headed there to finish the deal . Send me the coordinates of this representative . Done . His name is Xero Throbe . Thank you , soldier . My pleasure , Khondor . Dolphina ... Have you received the data ? Data received . Good . Master , after research , it seems that the desired contact , Xero Throbe ... Has a folder on the human network information . And ? And the least we can say , master , is that its business representative for UMA colonies is by no means the highest thief of arms . He seems to be well known for his passion for games , trafficking of various drugs , and a strong presence on the resale market organ . Dolphina ... Are you tapped into their network ? Yes , master . It seems that it is not very far from you . You should still go ahead and find yourself facing a bar , its calling " Heavy " which holds the concession . You seem in a very bad spot . Take this ... And give thanks to the gods . I 've found it . Xero Throbe . Does that revive your memory ? Holgarth the alchemist . You helped him buy a micro colony . You have really no idea who you are dealing with . I know exactly who I am dealing with . Do you ? Dolphina . Calculate the fastest route to the lunar base . Yes . Recalibration engine is underway , and we should be operating on the fly deck seven in a few minutes . Very good . I 'm on my way . Our course is now active . Good . Hyper speed in three ... Two ... One . It 's far too quiet . Increase scanning range and put up the shields . You are right , master . I 've detected the presence of a defense system . I would expect no less from Holgarth . I will not retreat . Fire a volley missile , level Okko . Holgarth ... You 're wasting precious time . None of your traps and delays will stop me . Holgarth . The princess Alaria is dying . You have to help her . Ah . So , Targot sent you , did he ? Alaria suffers from d 'Avsara . The " Curse of the Cold " . I beg you . Help me save her . That 's all I want . I don 't mean you any harm . Harm ? I fear no harm . I can regenerate from just a few ashes . Death does not exist for me . It is ... A childhood nightmare , and I am an adult . As you shall be too . My dear fellow , I cannot tell you how many years I have looked forward to this meeting . That 's impossible . How can you have been waiting for me ... When we never met ? Well , it 's simple , isn 't it ? You know that I have the secret of immortality . But the elixir of life is not for anyone . It must be deserved . And your species deserves to survive . And you ... You are the very last of that magnificent line . So , my friend ... I have a gift for you . Take it ... And like me , you will enjoy the centuries to come . But it 's the princess that needs the elixir . Forget her . She fought . She lost . She will soon be dead , and that is as it should be . The offer of eternal life is for you alone , my friend . I don 't care about your eternal life . I have one and only one purpose ... and that is to save Alaria . If you don 't give me the cure , I will destroy this entire planet . And you may not fear death , Holgarth ... You won 't like your long life elixir very much , as you 're floating alone in the entire space . Forever . Do you know ... I do believe that you 'd really do that . But here 's the thing , you see ... Your threat is in vain because I do not have the cure . But there is one ? Oh , yes . There is one . That is the only antidote . So , forget her ... And take the elixir . I drink the elixir , I doom the princess . Yes . I swore on my life to save Alaria . And I will . I need landing clearance immediately . I need to see the princess at once . Your majesty . I 'm back . My loyal Khondor . I knew you would not fail me . Quickly . Give her the antidote . Wait . I have to explain . The antidote is not an elixir . The only thing that can save the princess is the blood of an Okmer . All the blood . My blood . You 've sacrificed so much . Is there no other way ? No , Khondor . I prefer to die . These people , your people ... They need you . If you die , so will their hope and their desire to live . It will be the end of all . I can 't let that happen . I save you ... You save them . For the sake of our people ... Drink .

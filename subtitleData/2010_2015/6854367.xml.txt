 OLIVIA : Who is this guy ? What is he doing ? Watching . We refer to him as the Observer . NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : OLIVIA : That 's a different guy . - Who are these people ? I think these guys show up at important moments . WALTER : We were dead , Peter . We were drowning and he dove in . We were saved , both of us , by a man that I had never met . The boy is important . He has to live . I have said too much . I 'm not supposed to get involved . - It appears you 've been busy . - You have changed the future . - You need to restore balance . - How ? You will have an opportunity to fix this . Please don 't take my son . Walter . Peter . - You 're up early . - No , I 'm still asleep upstairs in my bed . You 're just talking to an astral projection of me . You 're just saying that to see if I 'm high . What are you doing , Walter ? - I 'm making myself smarter . - Really ? When William removed those parts of my brain all those years ago he diminished my intellect . And now I 'm not the equal of my equal . - Your equal ? - Walternate . If I can think like him , I can figure out what he 's trying to do with that device and how to keep you safe . - Walter ? - Hmm ? Sure you should be dabbling in that ? I 've done hundreds of experiments on myself . No , that 's not what I meant , Walter . According to William Bell , he took out those parts of your brain for a reason . Because you asked him to . Because you were afraid of what you were becoming . I don 't wanna see you hurt yourself . I won 't hurt myself . ( GROANS ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Who 's that at 2 in the morning ? - Oh , my pizza . - So you are high then . - Maybe a bit . We 've got a live one . PAM : That 's Mr. Joyce , he 's a sleepwalker . Open door in the patient wing . Who is that ? Come on . Mr. Joyce . Are you awake ? Mr. Joyce ? Who were you talking to ? That boy , where did he go ? I was talking to Bobby . Bobby ? Now , he definitely wasn 't talking to Bobby . JOE : Who 's Bobby ? PAM : He 's Mr. Joyce 's son . He died in 1985 . What did he say to you ? Did you tell him ? - What now ? - I take you back home . Fringe s3e10 The Firefly ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Olivia Dunham ? - Yeah . Thank you . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Dunham . - Hey . OLIVIA : Hey . What 's up ? Broyles was just telling us a ghost story . Bobby Joyce , he 's the son of one of the residents here . Or rather , he was . He died 25 years ago . And it gets more odd . The cameras picked up this as well . The Observer ? - It 's been a while since we 've seen him . PAM : Agent Broyles ? You coming , Walter ? Yes , of course . After I took a second look at the video , I knew who it was . Mr. Joyce keeps a photo of Bobby on his bedside table . I 've been looking at it since I worked here . Mr. Joyce say what he and Bobby were talking about ? He doesn 't remember . He was sleepwalking . That 's Mr. Joyce . - Roscoe Joyce . - You know him ? Mr. Joyce . Mr ... Mr. Joyce . I 'm Walter Bishop . I 'm a tremendous fan . Nice to meet you . - You ever heard of Violet Sedan Chair ? - No . It 's Walter 's favorite band . Roscoe Joyce is their keyboardist . He 's a hero of Walter 's , up there with Einstein and Tesla . Uh , Mr. Joyce , I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham . Hi . I understand that you had a visitor last night . JOYCE : My son . I don 't remember talking to him , but I remember he was here . It 's a curse , not remembering a miracle . It was a miracle seeing him again . Can you imagine what that 's like ? Yes , I can . Mr. Joyce ? I 'm sorry . It 's time for his physical therapy and his medication . Ready , Mr. Joyce ? All right . One , two , three . I 've come to believe in some strange things , but ghosts ? WALTER : Bobby wasn 't a ghost . The Observer doesn 't experience time like we do . If we can accept that he can travel from the past to the present and back again then it 's not inconceivable that he could bring others with him . We 'll have to try and help Mr. Joyce remember what his son said to him . - I 'll need to take him back to my lab . - Why would the Observer drag a man 25 years through time just to talk with his father ? I don 't know , but every time the Observer shows up it has something to do with you . And every time , it 's something bad . - Walter , come on . You ... - I 'll go and wait in the car . I 'll make the arrangements to have Mr. Joyce released . Three pills at 8 : 00 this evening . And he gets a little cranky if he doesn 't eat . All right , I got experience with cranky . Thank you . Have a good one . That 's sweet . Yeah , it is . Uh , I don 't think that this was for me . It arrived this morning , I looked at the date on the order and it was from when I was over there , I figured that it was probably for her . - Olivia ... - It 's okay . I understand you 're gonna help me remember what my son said to me . We 're gonna try . MAN 1 : I 'm almost done here . You guys finished out front ? ( MAN 2 GRUNTS ) I 'm at 719 Skelton Avenue , there has been a robbery . ( WOMAN GASPING HEAVILY ) Help me . Thank you . PETER : Walter ? Where do you want this ? Uh , right there . Perfect . Thanks , fellas . - What 's he listening to ? - Ocean waves . I need him to be in a peaceful state of mind for the hypnotherapy to take full effect . Once he 's in a more pliable state , he may be able to access his memories . That 's a good look , Walter . These were created by an old friend of mine Dr. Jacoby from Washington State . They will enable me to see Roscoe 's aura so that I can measure the depth of his hypnotic state . And the piano ? Roscoe 's mind doesn 't work like ours . His creativity is expressed through music . Playing may help him to recollect the conversation he had with his son . And if you just happen to get a concert from your musical idol ... That 's not why I 'm doing this . But I cannot deny that I would enjoy it . Mr. Joyce . We 're ready for you . What do you want me to do ? Let me guide you , listen to my voice . I will speak into the microphone . Now imagine yourself somewhere tranquil serene , safe . Go down the staircase ... OLIVIA : So there 's no footage at all ? Okay . Well , thank you for checking . I thought maybe the traffic cameras picked up the Observer , but no luck . How 's it going out there ? Uh , Walter 's channeling the Amazing Kreskin . - I wanted to try and explain the book . - You don 't have to . She asked me what my favorite book was . I understand that she was probably just trying to gather information on me but I also know that I 'm not the easiest guy to get to know . It 's always been easier for me to keep people at arm 's length . Which is actually something that I think we have in common . The book wasn 't meant for her . It was meant for the Olivia Dunham that I 've spent the last couple of years of my life with . Because I wanted you to read it . You 're the person I wanted to share it with . You know , I feel like Rip Van Winkle . Everything is different . Even you opening up to me is different . And this book is just a reminder of all the things that I missed . Conversations we didn 't have . You guys should come see this . Walter 's doing it . Sit . At the count of three you will open your eyes , but you won 't be awake . You 'll still be open and receptive , as you are now . Are you ready ? One , two , three . ( JOYCE CHUCKLES ) It 's been a long time since I touched a piano . Roscoe , I want you to think back to the night you saw Bobby . Tuesday . Tuesday is chicken dinner . Yes . And after you went to bed and fell asleep , what happened ? Bobby . My boy . I didn 't believe it was him . Had been so long since I 'd seen him . I asked him if he was real . He took my hand . He was real . What did he say ? He whispered something to me . He was so close I felt his ... ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) God , I 'm ... I 'm ... Dunham , can you hold on , please ? I 'm so sorry , Walter . - This is Dunham . - Roscoe , what did Bobby say ? - I don 't remember . OLIVIA : Got it . I 'm on my way . The Observer 's been spotted in Brookline , so ... - Walter , you all right ? - If " all right " means despondent , yes . Peter , go . I 'll take care of him . Walter , I 'm sorry . He was in a brown shirt . Who was ? Bobby . His mother gave it to him . What did Bobby tell you ? He told me I would meet you . Walter Bishop . He called you by name . Bobby said I was supposed to help you . Help me ? How ? I don 't know . Don 't you ? It has begun . I have set everything in motion . I have watched Dr. Bishop as long as you have . Perhaps not as closely , but I think you 're wrong . - He won 't do it . - I disagree . I believe he has changed . ( CAR DOOR OPENS ) You think he has changed . I don 't believe he has . In either case , I suppose we will find out soon enough . ( PLAYING UPBEAT POP MUSIC ) Are you sure you don 't know what I 'm supposed to do for you ? - No idea . - Bobby told me to help you . You already have . Just hearing you play , I feel like I 'm a teenager again . Can I ask you something , Roscoe ? Why did Violet Sedan Chair break up ? I don 't know , it just happened . We were having creative differences . We figured the best thing to do was to take a break . Give the band time to regroup . One day I looked up and a couple of years had gone by I 'd barely touched the keyboard and then a couple of more . Eventually , it just seemed easier not to . I suppose that 's hard to understand . ( MOUTHS ) No . I spent years away from the things I love . I 've been trying to get back into the swing of it ever since . I was having an asthma attack . It was like , he saw what I needed . He got my inhaler from my purse . Did he say anything to you ? No , nothing . It was like nothing affected him . He had this calmness . I didn 't even think he was real , except he saved my life . So , what is all this you got here , huh ? Recently , I invented a liquid base to aid in the process of brain mapping . Ha . Really ? Brain mapping , huh ? That 's a good name for an album . Any chance you could explain that to a simpleton like me ? I don 't want to bore you with the details , but I 'm missing parts of my brain . And I have to rejuvenate them in order to rise to the intellectual challenges before me . And they are ? Discovering why your son , Bobby , left the message . And how to keep my son , Peter , from the peril surrounding him . Is that milk ? The milk acts as a bonding agent for the other compounds . - And it helps disguise the taste . - Ah . I don 't see how I can help you in any way . My knowledge of science begins and ends with inventing a recipe for a strawberry milkshake . You like strawberry milkshakes ? They 're my number one drink since I stopped drinking . It 's mine too . - Astrid , come out here please . - Walter , what is it ? WALTER : Go to the grocery store . - Walter ... We need a gallon of strawberry ice cream some sweet whey and some yeast and some sugar . Okay . We need coffee , anyway . Thank you , dear . I spent six years perfecting my recipe . You must try it . To answers . Did you forget something ? I hope they didn 't run out of sweet whey . Hello , Walter . We need to speak . You call it autumn , is that right ? Lovely word . We had a deal . Please , don 't take him from me . The drawing , Peter and the device , you know the future . Tell me how I can save my son from dying . There are things that I know but there are things that I do not . Various possible futures are happening simultaneously . I can tell you all of them but I cannot tell you which one of them will come to pass . Because every action causes ripples . Consequences both obvious and unforeseen . For instance after I pulled you and Peter from the icy lake later that summer Peter caught a firefly . I could not have known he would do that . Or that , because he did , a young girl three miles away would not . And so later that night , she would continue looking trying to find another one . I could not have known that when she did not come home her father would go out looking for her , driving in the rain . So that when the traffic light turned red his truck skidded through the intersection at Harvard Yard killing a pedestrian . Did that happen ? You and I have interfered with the natural course of events . We have upset the balance in ways I could not have predicted . Which is why , now I need your help . How ? When the time comes , give him the keys and save the girl . Give him the keys ? What do you mean ? What girl ? You should answer your phone . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hello . PETER : Apparently , your friend is fighting crimes . - Friend ? - The Observer . He broke up a robbery at a jewelry store . Three guys tied up the girl who worked here . Girl ? Yeah , according to her , the Observer saved her life . - Who is she , the girl ? - Her name 's Victoria DiMiro . - Why ? - I need to speak to her . Bring her here . - Walter ... - Don 't argue with me . This is important . - I need to speak with her . - Fine , but you 'll have to wait . Cops are about to take her so she can give a statement . Well , as soon as they 're done , bring her here to me . Ah , there you are . I have several things to tell you . First Miss Farnsworth is back . And I remembered something else . - Oh ? - Bobby called me on the phone . - Just now ? - No . No . No . Years ago . We were on tour and he called to tell me about a strange dream he 'd just had . He dreamt a bald man in a dark suit took him to see me . I was an old man living in a nursing home . Dreaming about something that happens 25 years later . I don 't think it was a dream at all . I think the man in the suit took your son through time . And it was only just last night that you caught up to the other end of the visit . Hmm . Wild . You know , come to think of it that was the last conversation we had . Him telling me about his dream . We were playing a show that night . A club in Harvard Yard . Bobby was on his way to the show . I remember looking outside and seeing how hard it was raining . I remember getting a call from the police . They told me he stepped onto the crosswalk when a truck ... Skidded through the traffic light . They said it wasn 't anybody 's fault . When I lost my son nothing seemed to matter anymore . That 's the reason I broke up the band . But here I am . I played again . It felt good . It felt right . Maybe that 's why Bobby came back . Maybe it was . Would you excuse me for a moment ? Hey . Peter called . He wanted me to let you know that they 're on their way back . And they 're bringing the salesgirl with them . Walter , what is it ? - I know what the Observer 's doing . - Okay . The day I crossed over and saved Peter , I set off a chain reaction . I set the universe off balance . Two of them . I 've seen the damage with my own eyes , but it 's not enough . It 's not enough to understand the suffering I 've caused ... We 've been over this . You couldn 't have known ... That 's exactly the point . Unforeseen consequences but my fault just the same . That man has lost a son because I was unwilling to lose mine . And now the Observer is trying to restore balance and he wants me to help him . To help undo all the damage I 've caused . But I can 't , don 't you see ? Doing that , I would lose him all over again . - Lose who ? - Peter . - Walter . - I need a phone . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Hello ? WALTER : Ask that salesgirl a question . Where she was in 1985 ? I can 't . She 's in the car in front of us . We 're passing through Porter Square we should be there in five minutes . You can ask then . Peter ? WALTER : Peter ? Peter , what is it ? - Check the other car , I 'll go after him ! WALTER : What 's happening ? PETER : The Observer ran into the cop car . - Peter , are you all right ? - We 're gonna need an ambulance . WALTER : Peter ! I gotta go . I gotta go . Where 's your inhaler ? ( WOMAN GASPING ) It 's not in there . The bald man in the store , he took it . Okay , put your arms around my neck . OLIVIA : Excuse me . FBI , move ! PETER : Try to calm down . You 're gonna be all right . - Peter , are you okay ? - I 'm fine but she 's not . ASTRID : What 's wrong ? - She 's asthmatic . - The adrenaline from the crash ... - Triggered an attack . - Ambulance on the way . - Where you going ? Olivia took off after the Observer . I 'm gonna catch her . - Give me the keys and save the girl . - What did you say ? I said , give me the keys and save the girl . - He told me you 'd say that . - Who ? The Observer . This is it . This is his plan . This is what he wants . - You spoke with the Observer ? - Yes , he 's course correcting . I don 't know how , but he 's started a chain reaction . It started the moment we walked into that nursing home to meet Roscoe . Everything since has been the sequence culminating in this moment . And if I save this woman and let you go , I 'm afraid the consequences are gonna ... You 're gonna die , Peter . They 're gonna take you from me . You can 't predict the future and neither can I but if you don 't help that girl now , she 's gonna die . - They 'll take you from me . - Walter , give me the keys . Give me the keys , Walter . Excuse me , out of my way . Move . FBI , coming through . Excuse me . PETER : Yeah ? - I 'm on State Street . I 've lost him . I got him . He 's headed into a hostel at 2119 Main Street . OLIVIA : Okay . I 'm on my way . Hey . ASTRID : Walter , she 's getting worse . Now , I want you to lay down , please , so we can help you . Lay down . Astrid , put your hands at either side of her ribs , please . It 's all right . When I tell you , I want you to push up , applying constant pressure . - Okay . - I am going to use this plastic bottle to push air into your lungs . Okay ? Will you hold your nose , please ? Okay , good . Are you ready ? All right , push . PETER : What is this all about ? You know , don 't you ? The picture of me and the device , what does it mean ? What 's going to happen to me ? It must be very difficult . What ? Being a father . ( GRUNTING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Hey ! ( PETER GROANS ) You 'll need to keep her calm to prevent another attack . Thank you . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Hello ? - Walter ? We lost him . - Peter . - No , Walter , the Observer . Peter 's fine . He 's just a bit banged up . Why would you think we lost Peter ? Is Peter okay ? Yes . It doesn 't make sense . Why would the Observer do all this ? Ah . Home . It was a pleasure to meet you , Kelly . You too , Roscoe . I don 't know what to say . Come visit me sometime . Bring me a strawberry milkshake and I 'll play some piano for you . It would be an honor . I forgot what my son felt like . What he smelled like . How it felt to be around him . But now I remember . Nobody is supposed to have a second chance like that . First he saves the girl , then he tries to kill her . Then he runs up five flights of stairs just to shoot me with his magic air gun and disappear . None of it makes any sense . And how is this different to any other day ? Heh . Are you sure you don 't wanna go see a doctor ? No , I 'm okay , thanks . Ever feel like every time we get close to getting the answers somebody changes the question ? Olivia . So why is this your favorite book ? Because it talks about not depending on other people for answers . That you can only find the answers inside yourself . Which , given our current situation is kind of amusing , if you think about it . ( GROANING ) Peter ? Peter . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) - Walter Bishop . OLIVIA : Walter , Peter 's collapsed . He 's having some kind of a seizure . He took some aspirins and milk . - Milk ? - Yeah , from the refrigerator . - Oh , God . - " Oh , God , " what ? The organometals in the serum must 've reacted with the phosphates in the milk . Walter , what do I do ? What you need is an anticoagulant to stop the seizure . In my medical bag on the shelf near the centrifuge . Okay , I got it . You also need the gallon jug of saline , on the bottom shelf . Open the bag , you 'll find a bottle of magnesium sulfate . Use the syringe . One cc of magnesium sulfate , 9 cc 's of saline . It 's not here , Walter . The magnesium sulfate , I can 't find it . No , no , no , I moved it so I 'd know where I put it . - It was such an obvious place at the time . - Please , Walter . I alphabetized it . It 's in the refrigerator , next to the mayonnaise . - Okay , I got it . - Quickly . Okay , Walter , where do I put it ? In his leg , in his right leg . Olivia ? Please tell me what 's happening . Olivia ? Okay . Okay , I think he 's stabilizing . I think he 's okay . ( JEREMY LITTLE 'S " IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN " PLAYING ON STEREO ) I could while away the hours Conferrin ' with the flowers Consultin ' with the rain Hey . I made you some rosemary chicken soup . How are you feeling , son ? I 'm better . Thank you . - What are you thanking me for ? - For what you did . My serum was flawed . It would 've killed me if I 'd taken it . You only lived because you 're young and healthy . I suspect that 's what this was all about . You lost me , Walter . I think the Observer saved my life . He gave you a knock on the head so you 'd take some aspirin and the milk so you 'd ingest the serum instead of me . If that 's all he wanted , there must have been an easier way . He 's not human , you can 't expect him to think like us . - Oh ! - Thank you . I would not be just a nothin My head all full of stuffin' My heart all ... I must admit , I feared my experiment would fail . But you were right . He 's changed . He was willing to let his son die . Yes . And now we know when the time comes , he will be willing to do it again .

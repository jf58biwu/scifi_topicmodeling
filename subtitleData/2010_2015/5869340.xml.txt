You know it 's survivable . Why would you stay here ? It 's not survivable for us . The grounders seem to have managed . Natural selection works . The grounders who couldn 't survive In the radiation didn 't . Those who could passed on their dna . For better or for worse here , We never went through that process . Well , neither did we . We 've been on the ground now for ... Solar radiation . Very good . Your dna ran The same gauntlet as the grounders . Only because radiation levels in space Are even higher , your ability to Metabolize that radiation is even stronger .

The only reason This one survived is because they left him Behind to guard me . [ gasp ] [ coughing , gasping ] Raven . Lie on your side . Lie on your side . Come on . Fine , then just roll over yourself . Get down on your side . You 're ok . It 's all good . Why are you helping me ? I don 't want to die alone . I know you 're scared , But we are warriors .

Every room , every hallway , every way out . Way out ? Look around you , clarke . There 's no one hunting us here . First time in our lives we 're not hungry . Why would we want to leave ? Because we have friends out there Who need our help . They 're looking for survivors , And they 're way better equipped to find them than we are . This place is too good to be true . You 're bumming me out . I 'm--i 'm gonna Get more cake . [ sigh ] Take mine . Thanks . Jasper . Maya . Cold hands . Low vitamin d . Unlike yours , which is Off the charts , by the way . Well . All right . I was excited . Mm . Oh . [ chuckles ] No chocolate in space , huh ? Space sucked . What 's the deal with all this stuff , anyway ? This is nothing . There 's an entire warehouse with just paintings . President wallace is the first to hang them up . Guess he figured just because we don 't have windows Doesn 't mean we can 't have a view . Hey . It 's maya , right ? I just wanted to say sorry For this morning . I was scared and worried about my friends . I hope you can understand that . I know she 's intense , but ...

[ crying ] [ footsteps ] Man : There she is ! Hold it right there . Second man : Get your hands up . [ grunting ] How did you get to be such a dick , murphy ? I 'm sorry for shooting you , ok ? Is that what you want to hear ? Let me guess . Mommy and daddy didn 't love you ? No , they loved me . Are you gonna cry , murphy ? Screw you , raven . No , tell me . I want to know . How does a kid who 's loved by his parents Turn into a murdering psychopath ? He gets the flu . His father steals medicine That turns out wouldn 't help anyway . Gets floated for it and ... His mother , she starts drinking Pretty heavily after that and ... Last words she says to him Before he finds her in a pool of her own vomit Is that ... Is that he killed his father . Boo-hoo . You have to stand on your feet . He 'll kill you if you don 't . We 're warriors . We 're warriors . We 're warriors . We are warriors . [ both shouting indistinctly ] [ shouting stops ] We 're here now . Everything 's gonna be ok . [ whistling ] [ indistinct shouting ] Don 't stand up . I 'm fine . We need to get Back to the dropship . Hey . Where 's clarke ? Is she all right ? She was when we left . We 'll take you to her . Wait . Slow down . Sinclair . We 're splitting up . One guard detail comes with me to the dropship . Everyone else here goes with you to alpha station . You have the coordinates . We 'll follow As soon as we can . Yes , sir . Anything more from jaha ? No . Nothing in the past hour . Ok . You six with me . You two , lead the way . Man : All right , let 's go . Come on . We 're on the move . Let 's go . You 're almost there , abby . Octavia : Ai laik okteivia kom skal kru en ai gaf gouthru klir . Once more . Come on , say it . Come on . Ai laik okteivia kom skai- - You know , you still haven 't even Told me where we 're going . Can 't you smell it ? We 're almost to the sea . No , i can 't smell anything . Lincoln , i 'm scared . It 's too quiet . We 'll take it from here . Banks , scanlon , you stay with them . We 'll signal once we 're sure it 's safe . Murphy : Help her . Raven . Raven . [ sigh ] raven . Raven , honey , it 's abby . Clarke 's not here . I don 't know where she is . What happened to you ? I got shot . I got shot . Man : We need a stretcher ! Second man : Sir . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Man : Hey , hold it right there . Second man : Get back here ! Uhh . Where is everyone ? [ people grunting ] Murphy : It was awful . There was hundreds of them . There was hundreds of them and if it wasn 't for raven- - Uhh--i don 't know what happened . Bellamy . You 're ... You 're alive . Aah ! You murdering son of a bitch ! Man : Stop , ... ! [ electricity humming ] [ electricity crackling ] [ gasping ] Place him under arrest . Finn : Wait . You don 't understand . Murphy murdered two of our people . He shot another one . He tried to hang bellamy . I don 't care . You are not animals . There are rules . Laws . You are not in control here anymore . Raven . Abby : She 's lost a lot of blood . It 's a miracle that she 's still alive . There 's no one else in there . Come on . Put her down over here . [ lincoln breathing heavily ] ... Now sleep . Be back with the antidote as soon as i can . You brought me to your village ? I won 't let you die . Lincoln ... Lincoln ... Hey , hey . They 'll kill you . Hey . Only if they catch me . Stay alive . And stay quiet . [ opera music playing ] Lose the handcuffs . There 's a blank canvas if you 'd like . I used to paint the ground , too . It 's not just the ground . It 's a memory . You 've been outside ? Yes . 56 years ago . For 5 minutes . I was 7 when the first of What we call the outsiders appeared . Before that , we thought We were all there was . Imagine our surprise . I don 't have to imagine . My father , this was his office at the time , Believed it meant that the earth Was survivable again , And so , he opened the doors . Within a week , 54 people were dead From the exposure . My mother and sister among them . Loss ... Pain , regret . Time eases these things , clarke , But the only time it 's ever truly gone is When i 'm painting . You didn 't bring me here to talk about painting . Did you ? I 'm afraid i have bad news . Our patrols have swept the area And found no evidence of survivors , Either at your camp or from the ark . How can they be sure ? They can 't . I 've ordered them to keep searching . I need to see for myself . I 'm sorry . I can 't allow that . I 'm doing this for your own good , clarke . It 's not safe out there . Radiation has no effect on us . It 's not the radiation i 'm concerned about . You need time to grieve . These men will show you to your room . And if i try to leave ? Please don 't test me , clarke . We 're leaving . What ? This is where they 'll come back . I don 't think they 're coming back . The grounders took them and you know that . Look ... We go with kane to alpha station , We get reinforcements , weapons , Then we find our friends . One question . How many more of us will be dead by then ? Abby says raven needs surgery Or she 's gonna die . It 's time to go . Abby ? Let 's get ready to move out . We gotta get there before dark . [ music playing ] Dante : For the past and the future we serve . All : We give thanks . Dante : Good health , good food , and good company . And the blessing of new friends . All : We give thanks . [ music playing ] [ indistinct chatter ] [ music playing ] Abby . Abby : Feed the ... First . Everyone else can wait . Was that your idea ? Yes , sir . It 's a good idea . Have we heard from him ? No , sir . Still radio silence . Well , you 're gonna brief me , then . Yes , sir . Mr. Chancellor . Jaha : Sinclair , if you can hear me and can 't respond . It has been 12 hours since our last contact . The air up here is holding up better than i am . Time for me to face the fact that i can 't help you anymore . My job is done . I am so tired . Tell kane and abby ... They 're on their--they 're on their own now . As long as they work together , everything will be ok . You remind them of that . You tell them to keep our people safe . Jaha out . [ sigh ] [ static ] May we meet again . [ powering down ] [ sigh ] [ baby crying ] [ crying continues ]

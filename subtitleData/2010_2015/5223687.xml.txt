 WOMAN : Previously on Alphas ... I found it . The shipment that arrived in New York from Stanton Parish 's factory . ( SHUSHING ) This is it . The manifest . It says , " Industrial Electronics . " RACHEL : Boxes were here . Thousands of them . Parish already has them . Who are you ? I 'm Stanton Parish . I 'm here to make you an offer . A child like Zoe , she needs an environment that she can thrive in , as do you . And you think you 're gonna come here and start giving us orders ? Rosen invited us . What ? He told me I had free access to all the intel . The investigation is not gonna be run by this team . Cley 's back at our office , rifling through our stuff ! You 're seriously gonna trust this to him ? Show me your hands ! Right now . Hey , what 's your name ? Uh , uh , Mitchell . Why are you locked in this room ? I have to be here . I 'm very important . Yeah ? Says who ? Stanton Parish . So , he touches you , right , and zap , he records whatever memory you 're thinking about . So you 're a Total Recall Alpha . Hello , Mitchell . Can you show me the last time you spoke with Mr. Parish ? I promise you , you will grow old in a better world than I have . HICKS : Parish won 't let you keep Mitchell chipped . He 'll come for him . Let him come . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) ( LAUGHING ) It 's all right , baby . ( BABY WHINING ) It 's gonna be okay . ( LAUGHS ) ( BABY COOING ) What 's so funny ? You , " The Baby Whisperer . " Yeah ? I think you 're a little jealous . I 'm not jealous . Nah , you are . Well , maybe I 'm a little jealous . I can tell . Maybe a little . All right , because you have been great with this kid . When it comes time for us to have our own , you 'll be great with them , too . Right ? Even if I am , what kind of world are they gonna grow up in ? No , no , no . We 're not gonna have this conversation about Parish . Things are getting so weird , and ... ( SNIFFS ) Smell that ? Fresh air ... ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( INCOHERENT SHOUTING ) MAN ON STREET : Look out ! Look out ! ( COUGHING ) ( BABY CRYING ) Come here , okay ? Stay here . Stay down . ( MAN COUGHING ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) JOHN : Hey , listen up . We 've got one dead , three injured . This is the sixth attack on the power grid this week . There 's no discernible pattern to the attacks , but on the bright side , in a day or two we 'll have these power grid protectors in place everywhere . So Parish will have a hard time keeping this up . The DOD says Parish is building up to something big . Since his last plan targeted the entire city , we 're expecting this one to be even bigger . And according to these intercepts , it 's gonna happen within the next few days . ANALYSTS : Next few days . Well , two days from now is October 22nd . Yes . October 22nd , 1862 . A Union officer was shot in the head and apparently killed . STANTON : Incoming ! Then he miraculously came back to life . ( GASPING ) And that is when Stanton Parish discovered he was an Alpha . So what are you saying ? This is some sort of twisted birthday party ? Yes . A hundred and fifty years to the day . Terrorists love anniversaries . Look , the plan is to keep pressuring his organization . D.C. Thinks that if we push hard enough , eventually something 's gonna snap . The best lead that we have is that electronics shipment that we almost intercepted . That 's gotta be a part of this . We don 't even know what Parish was planning to do with those computers . Yeah , well , that 's why Rachel is looking for Skylar Adams . Skylar knows how to figure these things out . If we can find her . I 'm doing my best . But Skylar is very good at not being found . Folks , we 're talking about two days from now . We 're still boxing in the dark . We need to find a way to Parish and find it fast . ( TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) Now , we 've got to get inside Parish 's head . Mitchell Morgan . Page 4 . If you want to get inside Parish 's head , he 's the answer . Parish 's memory guy ? Yes . But I thought Parish was only using him to store sentimental stuff . Yes , he did . I think there may be a way to dig deeper . But we 'd need to move him to a more appropriate facility , and New York Psychiatric has a secure unit . You want me to transport a high-value asset out of Building Seven in the middle of all this ? Yes , that is what I 'm asking . I 'd ... I could go with you . KAT : Mitchell knows me . I can make him more comfortable . I 'd rather you not , Kat . I 'm freshly trained in all this stuff , and what I don 't know , I can learn in , like , 10 minutes . Well , learning is not quite the same thing as applying . Doc , she aced Quantico in two weeks . Bill ... Look , the clock 's ticking . I 'll take whatever help I can get . All right , fine . Just get it done . ( INDISTINCT TALKING ) GUARD : Sir . We 're stocked up on meds , transportation 's in place . Doctors are reporting soon . Have we gotten what we need from Skylar Adams yet ? Vince is working as fast as he can . That is simply not good enough . I 'll have a word with Vincent . SCIPIO : It 's all coming together now . People will be scared . They 'll need a place to go , for the transition . That was Danielle 's idea . Her legacy . HARKEN : Yeah , Jeannie . Look , sweetie . Just stay at your mom 's . You 'll be all right . Okay ? Yeah , I love you , too . Yeah , kiss the baby . All right , bye . That Jeannie ? How is she ? ( SIGHS ) She 's traumatized , of course . Bill , I think I have an alternative approach to this whole thing . A way to take it directly to Parish . That 's great , because I 'm expecting a conference call from D.C. Right now . I 'll run it by them and see if it flies . ( PHONE RINGING ) Speaking of which . Harken . Yeah ? You don 't want to do that . No . This is strictly unofficial . You understand ? Do I understand ? You ... Can you hold , please ? Do I understand ? Parish 's organization is huge and nasty , and about to pull the trigger on something big . Now , Cley needs all of us to be rowing in the same direction , okay ? That 's NYPD , that 's DOD , and us . I realize that . Look , you either grab an oar or get the hell out the boat . We don 't have time to do anything cute . Knock , knock . Yeah ? Sorry to interrupt . You got that , right ? No , not you . Yeah . Yeah . No , you 're right . Of course . Okay . He didn 't go for it . His involvement isn 't critical . What if he gets in our way ? Well , let 's just hope he doesn 't . Good luck . All right . Give me five . Mmm-hmm . ( PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) KAT : Okay , lead vehicle , call in your turns . Advance team , maintain lock-up . RED TEAM MEMBER : Copy that . You really think Rosen can get more intel out of this guy ? Yeah . Nobody knows Parish as well as Mitchell . It sucks he 's chipped . He was a good guy to road trip with . Yeah , if you say so . Hey , blondie , you 're following too close to the lead vehicle . Fifty feet . ( VEHICLE RATTLING ) Maintain a constant driving speed . Hey , how about we switch ? You drive and I boss you around ? My feet won 't reach the pedals . ( CHUCKLES ) ( TIRES SKIDDING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( GUN COCKING ) Kat , are you okay ? Yeah . JOHN : Watch Mitchell ! Damn it ! It 's Scipio ! Come on ! Red team with me ! Blue team stay with the truck ! ( GRUNTING ) Holy crap ! ( GRUNTS ) Put him down ! Now ! ( WHIPPING ) Ow . JOHN : Come on ! Come on ! Keep moving ! Go ! Go ! Blue team , fan out ! Up the stairwells . BLUE TEAM MEMBER 2 : The area 's secured . There 's no sign of him . Where the hell did he go ? There 's no way he got past us . I lost Mitchell , too . RED TEAM MEMBER : Nothing here ! Damn it ! Cover the exits ! RED TEAM MEMBER 2 : Yes , sir ! Spread out ! ( PANTING ) Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me ( SIGHS ) So the Feds don 't have Scipio . I don 't know where the hell he is . We 'll deal with that in due time . DOCTOR : Almost done . STANTON : Thank you , Doctor . You 're all dismissed . ( SIGHS ) I said dismissed , Mr. Kowalka . Mitchell ? Hey , Stanton . How are you feeling ? Uh , my neck hurts . We removed the chip they inserted . It 's really good to see you again . May I ? Yeah . They 're gone . Rosen did this , didn 't he ? He erased my memories . Dr. Rosen . Yeah . He , uh ... He gave me an IV and , uh , a few injections about three days ago . No ... About four days ago . After that , all the extra stuff is just gone . It 's funny . For the first time in years , I actually feel like ... Like me . You know ? Like me . You were right . Parish took the bait . Did we get what we need ? ( SIGHS ) Yeah . I just ... I feel bad for Kat . Yes , so do I , but she 'll forget everything in two weeks . At least that 's something . I just wish we didn 't have to go that far . As do I , Nina . Hicks . It 's them . ROSEN : How is he ? HICKS : Alive . ( MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ) Is everything ready ? Yeah . He 's still out . I can smell the tranq working its way through his system . I got this . ( GRUNTS ) HICKS : Wake up , sunshine . We need to talk . Hello , Cornell . ROSEN : It 's all come down to this , hasn 't it ? Is this really who you want to be , Cornell ? Someone responsible for the death of millions of people ? Is this what you really want ? What I want is a lawyer . So , what ? I don 't have civil rights ? Why ? 'Cause I 'm not human ? You are very much a human , Cornell . You just choose to deny the fact . But there 's still time . Actually , there 's a lot less time than you think , Doc . ( SIGHS ) Hey , you know , the way I 'm tied up , I could burn myself if I accidentally trigger my ability . We wouldn 't want that , would we ? I know it 's bothered you for a very long time how closely aligned your emotional state is with your ability . But you 've always wanted to transcend it . Well , you can , right now . Seriously ? That 's the best you got ? Trying to head-shrink me into getting in touch with my humanity ? Where were you when I set my parents ' house on fire ? No , you 're 20 years too late , Doc . We need to move things along . ( SCOFFS ) NINA : Two weeks ago , Parish shipped a large number of electronic components from China to Newark . What do you know about that ? Gone . They moved . Where did they go ? Parish doesn 't tell me . It 's above my pay grade . Were there other shipments ? NINA : Answer her . Hundreds . Stuff 's been coming in for months . Ask him about Parish . Where is he ? Where 's Stanton Parish ? Where is he right now ? ( GASPS ) Where is Stanton Parish ? Answer me ! Where 's he right now ? Wouldn 't you like to know ? The last time you spoke with Parish , where did it take place ? ( GROANS ) Bite me . Nina , he 's blocked . Just like the senator . Oh , yeah . I 've got a vault in there , boys and girls . It 's ironclad . ROSEN : Well , let 's unlock it , shall we ? SCIPIO : Ooh . ROSEN : Rachel . Amobarbital . Fifteen CCs . SCIPIO : Ambo-what ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( SCIPIO CHUCKLING ) RACHEL : Fifteen CCs . In . ( EXHALES ) You 've gotta let it go , Kat , you know ? Sounds to me like you did your best . Excuse me . Good morning . Good morning , sir . Yeah , except I lost Mitchell and Jeff Kowalka . Plus , I had Cornell Scipio in my hands , and I let him go , too . So , basically , I suck . Well , sometimes in life that happens . Really ? You know what ? Okay . Really ? You 're gonna do that ? Yeah , because we 've got more important things to worry about . Tomorrow is the 22nd . Yeah , I know . The world 's gonna end . Look , Rosen said that Mitchell was the key to everything , right ? So we just ... We just recheck the scene . Maybe I missed something . Call Rachel , okay ? That 's her department . Yeah , I thought of that . I can 't get through . Did you try Nina ? Nina always knows where she is . Yeah , I thought of that , too . She 's not answering her phone . In fact , I haven 't seen either of them since yesterday . What ? Should we be worried ? No , why don 't you go check the scene ? Hicks ? Hic ... Hicks ? I 'll take care of it . Hicks ! GARY : Bill ! Bill ! Gary , what are you doing here ? I figured it out . Good for you . I ... Oh , thanks . You 're supposed to be at the hospital ? No , sarcasm . No , Gary , go back and spend time with your mother . Oh ! No , they kicked me out , though . The head nurse said that I was disruptive , and I said that she looked like an animal . But then when I was in the cab ... All right , Gary , get to the point . What 's the point , Gary ? Oh , I was scanning for Skylar in the cab , Bill . Rachel ? And the cab had GPS , which is crazy , because New York streets are on a numbered grid . They don 't even need a GPS , Bill . All right . Gary , Gary . Yeah ? We 're gonna be dead by the time you finish this story . No , Bill . It was the chip . Doc ? The cab had a chip . And Skylar has a chip . It 's in her arm . She uses it to communicate with her wasps . So , I just ... I ping it , and now she knows that I wanna communicate . She 's gonna call me back . ( SIGHS ) ( BUZZING ) Hey , Didge , do you hear that buzzing ? You need to finish or Vince won 't bring me popsicles . I 'm going as fast as I can . You really don 't hear that ? Maybe it 's the phone ? Where 's the phone ? We don 't have one . ( CHUCKLES ) We don 't have a phone ? Why don 't we have a phone ? We just don 't . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Vince ! Hey , Zoe ! How 's it going , Ms. Adams ? It 's Skylar . Yes , ma 'am . Popsicles ! Popsicles ! Your wish is my command . Thanks . You 're welcome . Orange , my favorite . You always know exactly what she wants . I 'm just trying to make her happy . Is , uh , this for me ? Well , it 's not done yet . I still haven 't found a way to get it to cut bone without releasing a crapload of bacteria . You promised me it would be done . You don 't want to get me in trouble , do you ? Oh , no . I want to do this for you . Good . I have an idea . Why don 't I look after Zoe for a little while , so that you can , uh , concentrate on your work ? Thanks . You 're welcome . Zoe ! How much longer ? What 's your problem ? I got you a lot of stuff already . I mean ... I mean , all kinds of tech . That first thing she did for you , that flashy thing , you acted like it was Christmas ... ( CHOKING ) What is my problem ? What is my problem ? I want that device , and I need it now . ( BANGING ) All right , look , man . Something 's wigging her out , okay ? I am trying to keep her focused . You have no idea how hard that is . Nor do I care . You promised me you 'd get the job done . I intend to hold you to that . Understood ? Uh-huh . NINA : Focus on the walls . Are they white ? Are they blue ? Are they green ? Focus ! You can ask the question any way you want . The answer 's gonna be the same . Up your ass . Nina , deep breaths . Your pulse is racing . I just ... I just need a break . ( SCIPIO GASPS ) We need to get through . We have a day , maybe two . Listen to me . Nina 's exhausted ! And Scipio 's blood pressure is topping off at 200 systolic . You 're sweating quite a bit right now . If I were you , I wouldn 't get too excited . RACHEL : Dr. Rosen ! We are in over our heads . I have friends at the CIA that do this for a living . It is time to call in the experts . No . We 're the damn experts . Now , you know Parish has people everywhere . How the hell else do you think they knew that Mitchell was being transferred , hmm ? Rachel , we 're not calling anyone else . We 're doing this ourselves . There 's some aminorex in there . Prepare a 5 CC injection , please . Aminorex ? Yes , 5 CCs right now . Hicks , aminorex can be dangerous . What are we doing here ? Getting answers . Are we really ? Because it seems like all we 're doing is bashing Nina 's head up against the wall . What if Scipio 's a dead end , huh ? What if we 're wasting time ? Look , the only one wasting time is you . Get what Rosen wants , and get it in there . Five CCs of aminorex . But it won 't lower his pressure , and it will not bring down his resistance . It 's a stimulant , Dr. Rosen . I know . It 's for me , Rach . I 'm sorry . I just ... I couldn 't break through . You did your best . Now it 's my turn . Cameron . I have another idea . Gary , come on . I need something from you . Skylar is ignoring me , still . It 's annoying . I hate that , though ... Hey , look into those things . ... when people ignore me . Gary , listen . I need you to look for , uh , Rosen . Bill ! You 're ignoring me . I was talking about Skylar . Gary . This is important , okay ? Yeah , there 's no signal . Just like Nina and Hicks . They 're all out of range ? No , no . They probably just took the batteries out of their phones . Gary , why would three people take the batteries out of their phones ? I don 't know . Hey . Hey , I went back and checked the scene . I found something . It kind of sucks . KAT : Tranq dart . It 's one of ours . I found that where Scipio disappeared . Lab confirms blood on the tip is his . Oh , he was darted . I ... I hate that , being darted . Gary , could you just ... Come on . On the DL . Quiet . I already checked with John . Nobody on the tac team had tranq guns . Which leads to the question , " Who tranqed him ? " Harken . ( EXHALES ) I 'm just going to go in here for a second . ( SIGHS ) That smells . I need to finish this . ( BUZZING ) Ah ! ( CLANGING ) ( SIZZLING ) ( GASPS ) ( GROANS ) Mommy , are you okay ? It didn 't hurt . That 's good . It should . ( BUZZING CONTINUES ) Something 's wrong . ( WHIRRING ) What are you doing ? Looking at something . What is that ? Are you a terminator ? It 's a transceiver . I made it . It controls my wasps . Where are my wasps ? So why is it bothering you ? Someone is trying to call us . Maybe we should call them back , then ? ( ZAPPING ) Ow , ow . Huh . It 's Skylar . No ! No ! ( GRUNTS ) Baby ! ( GRUNTS ) Meg ? ( RATTLING ) What did you do to her ? You wanted to be a tough guy , right ? Hmm ? ( GROANS ) We 're just getting started . I 'll let you two catch up . Son of a bitch ! I 'm okay . Don 't tell them anything . I haven 't told them crap . Those blocks , they work like a charm . What are they after ? What do you think ? Parish . They want to know where he is . He 's safe , right ? He 's isn 't still at the house , is he ? Why ? I 'm worried . I ... I can 't think straight . I 'm so sorry , Meg . I missed you . You know what 's been getting me by ? Thinking about you and me up at Saranac Lake . You remember that cabin ? Yeah . Yeah . It 's so pretty up there . ( RATTLING ) ( SCREAMS ) ( GASPING ) Nice try , bitch . Meg hates the mountains . She 's got allergies . ( GROANING ) ( SCREAMING ) You kidnap me , you beat me , you drug me , and now you try to mind-rape me ? No , I can do this . No . She doesn 't look very good . Come here . Hey , Doc . I was wondering what it 's like to be betrayed by your own daughter ? I mean , you sent her to her death , but she was a liar . She was a traitor . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) She deserved to die , I think . Don 't you ? Cornell , when you set your family 's home on fire when you were 15 , did you ever wonder what your mother and father and sister felt when they were burning to death ? Hmm ? Or how your other victims feel when you , uh ... How did you put it when we first talked ? You make their skin sizzle ? Drop dead , Doc . This is adrenaline . And you know that it triggers your ability . And while your hands may be fire resistant , the rest of you is not . You wouldn 't . ( GROANING ) ( GASPING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( SHRIEKING ) This has gone far enough . He 's a murderer . This is just about revenge , isn 't it ? If you don 't like it , cover your ears . ( SCIPIO SCREAMING ) I can 't stay here . Rachel . I can smell Scipio 's flesh burning . ( SCIPIO SCREAMING ) VINCE : Skylar ? ( GASPS ) What are you doing ? Leaving . Zoe , you stay there , okay ? ZOE : Mom ! You don 't have to do that . This is a safe place . Really ? How did I get here ? What did you do to me ? What did you do to my daughter ? I just helped you to be happy . For a change . Happiness is a warm gun . I 'm trying to be nice . If you 're nice , then I 'll be nice , and this place will be nice . ( CLANG ) If you 're not , well ... You don 't want this place to stop being nice . ( CRACKLING ) Zoe ! Mommy , help ! Run ! Zoe ! There 's no way out ! Unless you do as you 're told ! Zoe ! Zoe ! Zoe ! Zoe ! Zoe ! ( ZOE WHINING ) VINCE : It 's only gonna get worse . There 's no way out . There 's no way out ! Zoe ! You 're terrified . Zoe ! Zoe ! VINCE : There 's no way out . Mitchell , hope you 're feeling better . A little empty , actually . All this stuff , it , uh ... Looks like it 's really important . That is correct . Tomorrow , the world is gonna change . People may want to understand what I was feeling or thinking , my intentions . You still have your ability . Yeah . Would you allow me ? Yeah . I 'm about to change the world . It 's just a shame that so many people have to die . I told you where they are ! I don 't know anything else ! ( GASPING ) I need more , Cornell . I need more details . ( BRAKES SQUEALING ) Doc , we 've got three DOD SUVs outside . Oh , we need to go . I can 't take the chance of anybody finding out what I know . It 'll leak to Parish . You bet your ass it will . It 's Harken and Kat outside . What the hell , Rach ? You were supposed to be listening for people . You called them ? You said it . We were running out of time . You just didn 't want to get your hands dirty . Not this dirty . It 's all right , Rachel . Let 's go , Nina . NINA : I 'll stay with Rachel . You go . Just go . ( DOOR OPENS ) HARKEN : Go ! Move , move , move ! KAT : Oh , my God . What the hell did you people do ? ( GASPING ) I cannot believe Rosen screwed me again . The glasses , the messy hair , the cardigans . He seems like such a nice old dude . Please tell me that you got something useful out of Scipio . Rosen said he got what he needed , whatever that is . And Rachel ... Rachel was on the phone with us . Tomorrow is October 22nd , okay ? We 've got a lot of work to do , and we 're losing time . We all have work to do . We need to get back to the office . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Them , too ? Harken , you saw what they did in there . They went totally medieval on him . She 's right . We lied to you . Yeah , you 're a bunch of lying asses , but you know what ? I still need you . Let 's go . ( SIREN WAILING ) HARKEN : That 's not too much to ask , is it ? Right ? NINA : Yeah , all right . So , please , go back to your offices and get it done . Hey ! HARKEN : I told you nice . Bill ! NINA : I got it . HARKEN : Gary , what 's going on ? Wait . I found them ! I know where they are . Who ? Hicks and Rosen ? No . Skylar and Zoe . I know where they are . But you have to pay Obeekay . What ? Obeekay , the cab driver . He 's from Nigeria . He 's feisty . All right . GARY : Okay , Bill , Bill , it 's here . HARKEN : All right , all right . It 's here . Gary , where ? Oh , oh ! Hey ! Hey ! ( HONKING ) Gary , stay in the car ! No , no ! It 's my rescue , Bill . Come on . SKYLAR : Zoe ! HARKEN : Easy , easy . Put your hands where I can see ' em ! Easy . Easy ... ( GRUNTS ) GARY : Oh , oh ! Bill , I wanted to do that . SKYLAR : Zoe ! Zoe ! ( SKYLAR GASPING ) ( ZOE SOBBING ) Here , Gary . Cuff him . Oh , yeah . SKYLAR : Zoe ! HARKEN : It 's okay . Easy , easy , easy . You 're safe now , okay ? SKYLAR : Zoe ? Are you okay ? Are you okay ? This place is gross . Yeah , it is . Skylar , how 'd you get here ? Parish . He asked me to work for him . I told him to go screw himself . I ended up in The Twilight Zone . ( GROANS ) Scuzzball . Skylar , these look like your designs . Were they having you work on these in The Twilight Zone ? Skylar , what were you designing ? ( RAPID SHUFFLING ) The end of the world . Parish is preparing for a disaster . One of his own making . ( VEHICLE PASSING ) Parish is calling this an Adjustment Center . Yeah , but an adjustment to what ? Look , whatever he 's planning , he 's planning to do it all over the place . Look at this . Baltimore , Chicago ... Vegas . Oh , Jesus . Tyler . ROSEN : You 've got to warn them . Doc , I 'm not leaving you here . Cameron , you need to get all of this information to Bill . Right now . You have a family , I don 't . Now , go . Okay . Okay , you take this . You take this . You might need it . Okay ? Hurry . I 'll see you soon , huh ? Yeah . I 'm sorry . I should have warned you about the convoy . It 's just I didn 't ... Look , if we 're still alive in a day or two , we 'll talk about it . ( WHISPERING ) John . No . This is one of the things Parish made me build . It 's a mini photo-stim . Oh , but there 's no light bulb . Doesn 't it need a light bulb ? Yeah , it has to be hooked up to something , like a lamp or a computer screen . Power goes in , flashes come out . It 's like ... It 's like a serotonin storm for the brain . Which can cause seizures , like the one that happened to me , but ... Skylar , it actually boosted my Alpha ability . It made everything better . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . If you 're an Alpha , sure . It 's like steroids . Okay , so increased ability , more control . Well , that 's cool . I want that . Everyone would . KAT : Yeah , except what happens to people who aren 't Alphas ? Mostly ? They die . Wait a minute . Wait , wait , wait . So how many of these were on that shipping container ? Thousands ? Scipio said there were hundreds of shipments . Hundreds of shipments ? Yeah , and these are much smaller than we thought . So there could actually be millions . We 'd better start looking for them , then . KAT : Where the hell have you been ? Where 's Rosen ? NINA : Why don 't you have Lee ? We went after Parish . What the hell do you mean ? We 've been up in Yonkers . We found something . Just stop and listen to me ! Whatever Parish is planning on doing , he 's planning on doing it everywhere . So , what ? You just leave Rosen there ? He wasn 't done . SKYLAR : Of course not . He 's trying to take out Parish on his own ? HARKEN : We 'll send some people over there to deal with that . Millions of lives are at stake because of this thing . This is what 's important . This is what matters now . That 's the last grid protector for the day . Wanna grab a beer ? I got book club tonight . I 'd cancel , but Her Royal Highness would have a heart attack . ( CHUCKLES ) Another time . Mitchell ? Dr. Rosen . Where 's Parish ? Is he here ? I have a plan to change the world . It 's just such a shame that so many people have to die . He 's given you his memories again , hasn 't he ? I 'm going to watch the world change with a God 's-eye view . What do you mean , a " God 's-eye view " ? ( STUTTERING ) What is that ? What ? In an airplane ? What ? I 'm so hungry . Do you have an apple ? They used to grow apples right around here . ( DOOR OPENING ) Listen , they 're going to be coming for you . You need to hide somewhere for two days . Two days . ( MOTORCYCLE STARTS ) ( KEYS JANGLING ) Hey , Dr. Rosen . ( GASPS ) Parish wants you alive . Me ? Never really saw the point . ( CLICKING ) ( POLICE SIRENS WAILING ) Adios , Doc . ( GASPS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY )

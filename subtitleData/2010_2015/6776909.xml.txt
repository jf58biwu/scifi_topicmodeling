 Yeah ! Whoo ! Whoo ! Oh , it 's gonna be sick . It 's gonna be sick . This is gonna be so hot . Yeah ! Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! Speed . Where 'd they go ? Turn around ! Go back ! Go back ! Go back ! Go , go , go ! All right , all right . Quiet in the peanut gallery . And so by measuring the angle between the horizon and a specific celestial body , like the sun , a sextant can help determine one 's latitude . Got it ? All right . Well , you 're already in groups , so pass this around and see if you can do it yourselves . Paul , we can either grab this or grab you . You 're both tools . Okay . Fist pumps . Don 't worry , dude . He 's just pissed 'cause someday a geek like you will be his boss . Thanks ... I think . So how do we use this thing ? Oh , you wouldn 't know . You can 't smoke out of it . Take a hit ? It 's just a suggestion . [ Both laugh ] I don 't even ... Hello . A little help here . Hey ! Assignment over here . Grades at stake . Focus . Relax , lyndsey . Not everything 's about the grade . Just learn . And kirk , not everything 's about the impossible conquest . Buck up and pay attention . Nothing 's impossible , sir . Hey . Hey . It took a couple weeks , but it looks like things are really starting to come together down there . Yeah , when it doesn 't look like coeds gone crazy . They 're still college students , Laura . You can 't change that . When do we reach the Solomon Islands ? Well , the currents are with us , so we could get there by tomorrow , but you know how the captain gets when his precious is altered , so we won 't get there till the next day . Yeah , I know how the captain gets . It falls under that " for better or worse " clause we have . Okay . We should flip . Whew . Ooh ! [ Speaking tagalog ] What ? Okay . I don 't even know why we 're studying this . I signed up for this semester thinking I 'd be soaking up rays and sipping margaritas , not studying some stupid-ass tool . Yeah , I 'm with you . Bring on the booze cruise . We got GPS , right ? Why do we even need this ? Yeah , I don 't know . Oh ! Jesus , Paul . Mm-hmm . Time to take your roids . Paul , how many times have I got to warn you about the no cell phone rule ? I 'm sorry , Professor , but I just had to feed the machine . Ugh . How can you even drink that stuff ? With results like these ... pop ... How could you not ? I saw you ladies checking me out . Don 't act like you haven 't noticed . Oh , yeah , we noticed , all right . Your dick getting smaller . [ All laugh ] It 's not small . [ Thud ] What was that ? Aah ! Aah ! What is it ? It 's gross . Poor thing . What is it ? You mean what was it ? It 's a mega-mouth shark . You 're making that up . Not hardly , Cole . They were discovered in the seventies , but ever since then , only 50 or so have been seen . How come ? They 're borderline extinct , and they 're deepwater sharks , so they usually stay below 100 feet . Well , then what is it doing up here ? Could be some kind of disturbance or a seaquake brought it up . It looked like something attacked it . Excuse me . What are you doing ? Paul 's right , Anne . It 's quite rare . I wanna take a closer look . Whoa ! She 's a heavy sucker . Let it go , Franklin . I can 't . It 'll fall in the propeller . Aah ! Are you okay ? Is everyone all right ? Yeah . Yeah . [ Speaking tagalog ] Laura ! Laura ! Get the bilges going now ! Captain , ruptured belly . What do you mean ? Hull breach . We 're taking on water . What 's happening ? I don 't know , but something 's not right . No shit . The question is what and why ? Mayday ! Mayday ! This is U.S. education vessel sea king . Can anyone read me ? Over . [ Static ] We 've hit ... Something . Our hull 's been breached and we 're taking on water . Our present posi ... Hello ? Hello ? Shit ! Hi . Hi . Laura , what 's the problem ? We 're taking on water . Han and dakila are working the bilges , but that hull breach is going to have to be dealt with immediately . I tried to call for help , but the radios are out . Wait , wait , wait , wait . Are we sinking ? Oh , God , we 're sinking . All right , all right . We 're not sinking . We 're taking on water . And despite how that sounds , there 's a difference . Okay , I can fix the hole , but it 's gonna take time . Well , estimate to me how long . Well , that depends , but out here in open water , a day at least . Hey , what about that thing right there . Is that an island ? An atoll . What 's an atoll ? If we get to shallower waters , would that help ? If we can anchor ? Hell , yeah . All right . Get han and dakila . Keep them working on the bilges , and we 'll get to shallower waters . Aye-aye , captain . I told you this semester would offer you educational opportunities beyond your wildest expectations . Consider this proof of that . Oh , thank God . Civilization ! It 's most likely abandoned . Captain ? Just scuffed land . This is as far as she goes . Well , this is close enough . We 'll use the dinghy to ferry the students across while you make repairs . Okay . I don 't think that 's a good idea , Franklin . Oh , come on . This is a rare and wonderful opportunity for these students . Not the opportunity we were hoping for . There 's a day 's worth of work at least , while at the same time , taking on water . Best to stretch our legs , lighten our load . Besides , we might find something useful ashore that can help with repairs . I could use some more scrap metal . Who knows what I 'm going to find down there . Settled . Get the first group ready to go aboard . Okay . You coming ? Pass . First group , let 's go . What do we have here , a tide pool ? No , it 's more like a hole . Maybe there used to be a structure here and this was a post hole . Great start , guys . Let 's keep moving . Hey , Ethan , maybe you 'll find some wheat thins . Come on , guys . Why is he acting like this is a field trip ? Isn 't he concerned about what 's going on ? He 's trying to keep us distracted to keep us calm , lyndsey . Oh , yeah ? We 'll it ain 't working . You know , I 'm not feeling this crap . There could be cannibals out here . Um , Cole , that is crazy ridiculous . Actually , it 's not that ridiculous . Polynesians have practiced cannibalism for centuries . Now there are cannibals ? You 're not helping . Holy shit . Protein . Oh , not again . Jesus . Holy crap , that 's huge . That 's what she said . [ Boys laugh ] Just wait , everyone . Stay back . What happened to it ? Something ate it , stupid . Looks like a bunch of sharks got a hold of this guy . No doubt the result of a feeding frenzy . Feeding frenzy ? Great . Don 't worry , I 'll protect you . Relax , everyone . It 's just the circle of life . Now come on . We gotta find some scrap metal . Paul ... Let 's go . You gonna be okay down there ? It 's just a little welding . He 's a great teacher , Anne , and a great captain . With that sometimes comes with a little misguided enthusiasm . Sure you gonna be okay ? I 'll be fine , Anne . Really . Looks like a whole little village . Yeah , it does . Looks like no one 's been here for a while , though . Where are we ? Look at this . Ugh . Hello . Hello . I 've never seen anything like this . People actually live here ? Not many from the size of it . At least they have an outhouse . Fishermen , most likely , and probably only part of the year . So it 's not a bathroom . Just look in there . Hey , mate , look . They got lyndsey 's teeth on the wall . [ All laugh ] Oh , you 're so funny . Yeah , so probably it 's a safe bet that they 're not cannibals , colt . Cannibals . Better safe than dinner , Professor . Can 't argue with you there , Cole . What is this ? Wow . Kind of creepy . Is it real ? What is that ? It 's a wheel , but , you know , before this , they used to use something called a whipstaff to steer the rudder of the boat . Until the British got a hold of it and changed it to the wheel . That 's cool , bro . [ Laughs ] No , it is cool , though . I thought so . Dude , check it out . Feel my arm . All right , students . Spread out , but stay in this area . Remember , we 're looking for scrap metal or anything else that might come in handy . Hey , kirk . You really wanna go poking around this dusty old fish town ? No , but what else do we have to do ? I could use a swim . I don 't think babish would want us in the water . Babish . Babish won 't even notice , all right ? We 'll just go to the beach on the other side of the island . It is really hot out here . I don 't know . Listen , when are you gonna have a chance to go skinny dipping in a tropical paradise ? Wait , skinny dip ? Yeah , what ? One thing at a time . One thing at a time . Let 's go to the beach . Let 's check in here . You heard what he said . Scrap metal . So where you from ? Do you have a boyfriend ? Not recently . The water looks so nice . Don 't you just wanna jump in ? No . Why do you have to ask so many damn questions ? Okay , look , I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to snap . I 'm a little freaked out by the water . That 's all . How come ? Well , when I was 12 , it was the first summer that I was allowed to go to the beach with my friends . And all the girls were flirting with all the guys up on the beach , and I was just in the water by myself . Jumping waves . You know , like the little ones that come up ? Whatever . So anyway , I jumped one , and the water cleared . The only thing I could see coming toward me was this six-foot blue shark . It circled around a few times , came about three to four feet in front of me , and then just swam away . I guess it lost interest . You 're lucky . Yeah , I guess you could call it lucky , but since then I still haven 't been in the water . So then ... Why 'd you sign up for a semester at sea ? I know . Could you think of a worse place for me to be ? Submarine school ? [ Laughs ] Well , that 's the point , though . I don 't wanna be worried about it anymore . I don 't wanna be scared , especially after , you know , it being just some fluke incident . Well , the first step , I think , we explore this ghost town island , jaws or no jaws . It 's an atoll . You 're starting to sound like Paul . What did I tell you ? Is this worth it or what ? It 's gorgeous . It 's like nothing I 've ever seen before . It 's like a postcard . It 's better than a postcard because we don 't have to share it with anybody else . All right , who 's getting nude first ? Come on , now . Come on , Haley . Don 't be such a prude . Aah ! [ Laughing ] Oh , stop that ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh ! Do me next . Do me next . Maybe he 's right . This is a once in a lifetime experience . You think ? Oh , yeah . Yeah . All right . Is this more of what you had in mind , kirk ? This is exactly what I had in mind . Wait , Haley . Maybe we should share . Okay . All right ! Don 't you want in here ? Yeah . Haley ? Alison ? Shit ! What the fuck ? Haley ! Alison ! So we really didn 't find anything . But we only went halfway . Well , we should probably continue down that way . Right , guys ? Sounds good to me . Yeah . Let 's keep going . Man , it 's hot . No , you 're hot . Oh ... Guys ? Come on , guys . This is a wonderful eco-friendly environment . Now , we should be here about 24 hours , so we 'll learn to live by the land here . You know ? Whoa ! What is this ? Hey , you guys , what about these ? You think these 'll work ? Only one way to find out . Come on . Jesus , Cole . Watch it ! Cole ! Don 't worry , sir . It 's all about hand-eye coordination , both of which I have ... Give me that ! You , come with me . Looks like this thing 's been sitting here for a while . Well , I mean , can use ' em ? Does it mean they 're worthless ? I wouldn 't say worthless . Maybe not working . I mean , I could tune it up , but I don 't really know what the point would be because it 's not enough to fit all of us in it . Still , two boats are better than none . I guess I could try . It 'd be faster with a little bit of help , though . Hey , Paul , you 're a brainiac . You think you can help me tune these suckers up ? Yeah , sure . I could do that . Okay , cool . Give it a shot . [ Rumbling ] What 's happening ? No ! Are you okay ? Oh , my leg ! Are you okay ? We better find a first aid kit . You guys , come here . Help me . How bad is it ? We got to take him to see Dr. babish , okay ? Then let 's get him up , then . You 're nuts . We 'll take him . Get him . Get him . Get him . Come on . Let 's go . Come on . We 're almost there . We 're almost there . [ Rumbling ] What the fuck is going on here ? What was that ? Lyndsey , lyndsey , you need to calm down . You want me to calm down ? Then ... Get a hold of yourself , lyndsey . You 's a bitch . Look , I know she 's hysterical , all right ? But she has a right to be concerned . Let 's get back . That 's it . We need help here . Dr. babish ! Dr. babish , we need help ! Help ! Dr. babish . Laura ! Laura ! Dr. babish , we could use some help here . What happened ? He fell when the atoll shook . The atoll shook ? What are you talking about ? You didn 't feel that ? No . Well , get him up , boys . Get him up . I told you it was a bad idea to go ashore . As usual , I should have listened to you . [ Groans ] Jesus . I can patch it up , but we need to get you to a clinic as soon as possible . Solomon island , Laura . Where we going ? What do you see out there ? Don 't you see it ? It 's something bobbing right there . You see it now ? Yeah , it 's right there . What is that ? I don 't know . A little bit closer . Come on ! Come on ! Hurry up ! Take it ! What 's going on over here ? Cole , what do you want ? We just came down to see your ... Body of work . [ All laugh ] Well , the boat just needed a little bit of tuning up . The only thing we need now is gas . We just found this gas can . You 've got to be kidding . No . Come on , guys , bring it down . Wow , Cole . You 're not as big of a douche as I thought you were . Hey , sometimes I even surprise myself . Do you even know if there 's gas in that thing ? It smells like gas . What are you waiting for ? Bring it over . Vamanos . Yeah , we be fueling ' . Since when did you become so helpful , Cole ? Since we got stranded here on this island . It sucks , except for the fact that I 'm stuck here with you . [ Scoffs ] Do you even know how to start that thing ? Thanks . We got it . You wanna do the honors ? Help to your heart 's content . All right . Here comes the moment of truth . Untie the boat . With these guns , one pull . [ Engine starts ] Oh , my God . It worked . Oh , my God . And we are in business . [ Cheering ] Wait . What are you guys doing ? Where are you guys going ? Hey , Dana ! Hey , Kate ! [ All laugh ] Are you kidding ? Friggin ' brick . Help yourself . God . Maybe this wasn 't such a good idea . Yes , it is . I 'm gonna get the rope . Let 's go . Better now than never . God . Go , go , go . [ Engine starts ] Are you coming ? All right . No , go . All right . Go , go , go , go , go . Oh ! The atoll ... It 's sinking ! Quick ! The kids ! Oh , looks like we got some company . Looks like they wanna race , Cole . Let ' em catch up . All right . Get out of the water ! Hey , y 'all , look at this . Get out of the God damn water ! Those guys are so busted . Good . What are they doing ? Hey , hottie , nice work on the motors . What 's up ? Wanna see what they 're really made of ? What exactly did you have in mind ? Let 's see ... First one to the sea king wins . Wins what ? Don 't worry . We 'll work that out later . [ Scoffs ] All right , pretty boy , you 're on . Kick his ass , Kate . Hello . I 'm feeling pretty lucky . Oh , you 'll get lucky , all right . [ Laughs ] Okay , on the count of three . One ... [ Laughs ] Get out of the water ! Get out of the God damn water ! Looks like we 're busted . Well , then we might as well enjoy it . Whoo ! Not bad , you guys . Shark ! Shark ! Hurry ! What 's up with that ? Something 's not right , man . Oh ! Whoa ! [ Laughs ] Swim ! [ Chuckles ] Get on the boat , idiot ! [ All laugh ] No ! No ! Why is he scream ... I bet it 's a shark . Aah ! Oh , my God ! Shit ! Get out of the water ! Aah ! Oh , my God ! No ! No ! Get out of the water ! Oh , my God . No ! Why is it still chasing them ? It 's got two heads . Two heads ! Genetic abnormalities like that , I mean , they can occur . You see snakes with two heads , turtles , kittens , cows . But they can 't ... They never survive to maturity . Two heads is twice as many teeth . Twice as many ? That 's why . That 's why it 's going after Cole 's boat . The motor 's bigger . Oh , the motion , the noise . Right , right . Electro-reception . Twice the electro-reception , in fact . You see , it 's going after Cole 's boat because his motor 's bigger . It 's a bigger irritation to his heightened senses . So ? So it 's more powerful . What is he doing ? Trying to save himself . Kate , help him ! Oh , my God . Oh , no . Oh , my God ! [ Screaming ] No ! Get out of the ... No ! We gotta grab him . What ? What ? Help ! Help me ! Get ready , you guys . [ Screaming ] Where 'd it go ? I don 't see it . Where 'd it go ? Oh , my God ! [ Screaming ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! The kids are not safe ! Aah ! Thank you . Aah ! Aah ! It 's still coming ! It 's coming after us ! He 's coming after us ! What the hell ? You left them there to die . Kate , are you okay ? Hey . Kate , please stop . Kate , will you please wait ? Listen ... I don 't want to talk about it . I know you 're mad , okay ? Cole deserves an ass beating . He deserves a million . But we 've got more important things to worry about right now . Everybody saw that thing , okay ? People are freaking out . They should be . Come on ! Come on ! What are we gonna do ? With Professor babish back on the sea king ... He 's not on the sea king . Oh , shit . Are you crazy . Haven 't you seen what 's out there ? I did , Kate , but you students are still my responsibility . I 'm still the captain . So you saw it . Dr. Anne , have you seen Mike and Jeff ? They ... They didn 't make it . Laura , too . And jaime and Ryan and Alex . That 's six people , Cole . Okay , who else is missing ? Where 's kirk ? Or Alison . Or Haley . Really ? Wait . If Laura 's dead , does that mean the ship isn 't fixed ? Oh , God , lyndsey . I 'm just asking a question . The bilges are pumping out water , but there 's still a breach in the hull . To get in the water and fix it now would be suicide . Are the radios working ? The antenna snapped . Great . So we 're screwed . There 's nothing we can do ? There 's still one other means of communication at our disposal . Well , what is it ? The sea king is equipped with an emergency transponder , that when activated , sends out a traceable distress signal . Then activate it . What the hell are you waiting for ? To activate it means we have to scuttle the ship . Scuttle ? Sink it . Okay , great . Scuttle it . Scuttle it . No . If we sink her , it means well have to get supplies off first , which means multiple trips back and forth . No , we can 't do that , all right ? It 's got twice the electro-reception than a regular shark . It 's like it can sense every electro-magnetic field in the water . I really don 't see any other way . [ Rumbling ] Son of a bitch ! Be careful , everyone . That 's the second tremor today . Great . So now there 's earthquakes ? I really don 't think it 's an earthquake . So what is it , then ? It 's like the atoll 's collapsing . Of course it is . It would appear that way . Wait . What ? How is that even possible ? Atolls are built on foundations of coral . This one must be damaged or weakening somehow . Professor babish , are you saying that at any second , all of this could just ... boom ... Drop into the ocean ? Anything else you want to hit us with ? Anything ? If we 're not gonna sick the ship , then we 've got to repair it . I am not going in that water . What if we distract it ? Make noise . And I 'm not getting in that boat again . Look , you saw that thing out there , all right ? It had a choice between our boat and Cole 's boat , and it chose Cole 's boat because it was generating a larger electro-magnetic field , and thus a larger annoyance to the shark . Is there a plan in there ? Look , if we can create a charge larger than the torch at the same time that the boat 's being repaired , we 'll have enough time to get the work done . So how are we gonna do that ? With that . Does anyone know how to fix a generator ? I 'll give it a try , but why ? Okay , look , if we hook up the generator to those poles and put it in the water , we 'll send a current that will drive the shark nuts , and it 'll come check us out for sure . That could actually work . We still need someone to repair the boat . Does anyone here even know how to weld ? I don 't . What ? I do . You ? Yeah , my dad 's a welder . He works with metal all the time . I can 't ask you to do that . You 're not asking me . I 'm choosing to do it . I 'm still the captain of the sea king . The responsibility should be mine or han or dakila 's . We can do the work . No , no , no . You have a wound . The blood in the water will attract the shark even more than the charge . And you need han and dakila to fix the engines and the bilges . You can 't risk that . But Kate , you haven 't ... I mean , are you up for this ? Do I have a choice ? How do we get this done ? Quickly . [ Rumbling ] All right . Ready when you are . All right . So we 've got to grab this fence and put it in the water . Looks like you got a couple volunteers . Great . Now , we gotta take these poles and put ' em in a straight line , all right ? Then we gotta grab the wire and wrap it around the top of each to string ' em together , okay ? Then we gotta take the generator cables and hook ' em up anywhere . Do they even understand what I 'm saying ? All right . Well , we only have a few feet of cable left . Well , the closer to here , the further from there . Right . As soon as we see any sharks , I 'll signal them over . I don 't like that Cole 's going with her . I don 't like it , either , but he 's the one who offered . Let 's go , babycakes . Don 't call me that . Here goes everything . You son of a bitch ! All right ! [ Crackling ] [ Buzzing ] It 's working . Well , it 's conducting . We 'll have to wait and see if it works . [ Buzzing ] [ Crackling ] There ! God , she 's big . It 's working . If the dinghy motor doesn 't distract it , surely the torch won 't . So now it 's up to Kate . Hey , Kate , it 's crunch time . We don 't know how long this fence will work , okay ? It 's confused . Let 's hope it stays that way . [ Rumbling ] God damn , you look gorgeous . Wait . Have you ever welded underwater before ? Nope . But you 've been scuba diving before , right ? Nope . Kate , are you sure you can do this ? Listen , Cole , stop asking questions you don 't want the answers to . And keep your eyes open . It 's getting bolder . This isn 't good . It 's tracing the charge . Run . Run ! Come on ! Don 't look back . Don 't look back . Don 't look back . Kate , what happened ? Are you okay ? Cole stole the ship . Dumbass . That idiot scumbag . Did you repair the hull ? God , please , no . Damn ! No ! No ! Mayday ! Mayday ! Mayday ! I 'm sinking ! I 'm sinking ! Mayday ! Please , anybody there ? I 'm sinking , and there 's a two-headed shark attacking me ! So what are we supposed to do now ? We can 't stay here . So where else ar we supposed to go ? The motorboat . Some of us can take that and send back help for the others . We 're hundreds of Miles from anywhere . There isn 't enough gas . Lyndsey 's right . We can 't just stay here . This place is gonna flood . Yeah , especially with that thing still out there . It 's too dangerous . We 'll only end up stranded at sea . Once this atoll sinks , we will be ... So then we need a plan . What 's our plan ? I don 't know . No . Oh , God , no ! Aah ! Aah ! No ! No ! Aah ! We have to get off the beach ! Head for the trees ! Franklin ! We can 't help ' em . Run ! Go ! I think it stopped . I think we 're good . Keep going ! What about you ? Just go , Paul ! There 's nothing you can do about it . I 'm sorry . I didn 't ... [ Screaming ] We 're not gonna make it . We have to . The shark ! Shit ! It 's still coming ! The chapel ! What are you doing ? Come on ! Come on ! Get in ! Come on , let 's go . Come on ! Get in ! Go ! It 's flooded ! What are we supposed to do now ? I don 't know . Give me a minute to think . We don 't have a minute . We gotta get out of here . Where else is there to go ? That thing 's still out there . Aah ! [ Thudding ] No , it can 't . It can 't . It can 't . [ Screaming ] [ Gun clicks ] You guys go . I 'll be right there . Okay , so we can 't exactly outrun this thing . What are we gonna do ? We 're gonna try . What 's that ? Is that the gas barrel ? Right now it 's just a barrel . It 's still good . You 're right , Kate . We can 't outrun that thing . Our only chance is if that thing dies . Can you make this explode ? It 's combustible , but we need some source of fire . Yeah , that 'll do , but we need some sort of fuse , right ? And what if the shark comes ? How are we gonna get it close enough to the barrel without us being close to either one ? Yeah , what exactly is your plan for ... Still working on it . Take off your shirt . What ? Take off your shirt and wring it out . It 's the only change we 've got of getting a fuse . But still , how we gonna get the shark close enough to the barrel ? That 's the easy part , relatively speaking . Once it knows we 're here , it 'll come . I thought the point was to not be here . We won 't be when the barrel explodes . But someone still has to light the fuse and someone has to lure the shark . Lure the shark ? Don 't worry . I 'll do it . No , I 'll do it . You ? Kate , you told me you haven 't stepped in the water for 10 years . No way . You 'll freeze up , lock up . That thing will tear you to shreds . Maybe , but if it doesn 't , and if this plan of yours works , we 're still stuck on this sinking atoll . We don 't really have good chances . I 've lived scared for too long . I 'm not gonna die like that . [ Rumbling ] That 's as soaked as it 's gonna get . So all we have to do it light it , take off , and it 'll blow ? Right . Once the fuse hits the gas , it should ignite , rupturing the barrel and sending shrapnel everywhere . Yeah , but will that be enough ? If the shark gets close enough , it should be . Perfect . Kate , are you sure about this ? Fears don 't get over themselves . How long is the fuse supposed to take ? About 30 seconds , maybe less . All right . I 'll tell you when to light it . Then run . I 'll be right behind you . [ Groaning ] Come on , light it ! Please ! I 'm trying ! Go ! Go ! Hurry ! God damn it ! Hurry ! Shit . Light it . It 's taking too long ! It won 't light . Come on . Come on , damn it ! Come on , light it . Hurry ! It won 't catch . Come on ! Come on ! Over here ! Over here ! Over here ! Come on ! Get over here ! Kate , keep going ! Don 't stop ! Kate ! Kate ! Dana ! Dana ! Come on ! Hurry ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Oh , my God ! She did it ! It worked . It 's still alive . Go ! We 're not gonna make it . The boat ! The boat ! It looks okay . I think we can drive it . What ? No ! What are you doing ? Once we start this engine , the shark will follow the noise , right ? This boat is our only way out of here . Yeah , but there 's one other way to use it . What are you doing ? Hoping . Come on ! It 's dead . It worked . It worked ! It worked ! It worked !

 There 's every chance the virus will mutate . No ! The human race could be utterly extinguished . She 's a miracle , a walking vaccine . We knew about the virus before the crisis . Why didn 't you warn us ? The virus is spreading through the birds . - We 'll all get it , won 't we ? - You think I 'm tough ? - I think you 're perfect . - Thank you . She looked beautiful . - Why now ? - Now it 's all there is . " Hope never dies " . - This will lead to some marketing thing . - Yes , selling what ? - Do you know who else was on the flight ? - The chosen few . The saved . Who chose them ? Who chose you ? A new beginning , James . Hope never dies . I 'm going back to the lab , but this time on my own terms . Something 's happened . The virus finally broke through their defences . - What 's your name , son ? - Peter Grant . I know some people who 've been looking for you . Abby ! Peter ! Abby , wait ! Abby ! - Where did they go ? - Who ? Who is it ? Whitaker ! He had Peter with him . Are you sure it was him ? Peter ? I know my own son ! If he 's here , we 'll find him . She hasn 't seen Peter in a long time . None of us even knows what he looks like . Do you think she 's having some kind of a breakdown ? She sees a couple of strangers , decides it 's Whitaker and Peter ? Maybe coming back here was a mistake . It 's been too much for her . There 's food , a fire . Someone was here recently . - Do you recognise anything ? - I should have stayed at the lab . I should have let Whitaker do whatever he wanted to do . Better me than Peter . Stop talking like that . - But he could be anywhere . - He won 't go far . He 's waiting for everyone in the lab to die . We won 't have to look for him . He 'll come to us . - Anything ? - No . Better find out what happened in there . Wait here . It 's safer for me . Don 't hurt me , please . Please . What happened here ? The virus . When you came , you infected Jill Whitaker . Well , how do you know it was me ? They didn 't catch it from the birds ? The virus has already mutated ? People are dying who were immune before . Peter was brought here a few weeks ago . I did the tests myself . You 're right . He 's like you . If you tortured him ... ! He 's fine . I tested his blood , that 's all . When the virus infected the lab , Whitaker told us that he wanted to see the outside world one last time . He took Peter with him . - Why aren 't you dead ? - I 'm immune . I didn 't know . I thought I was gonna die . I was so scared . - Where 's her kid ? - Tom ! - I haven 't seen him for weeks . - Let her go ! You 're all at risk . You need me . Tom , she 's right , we need a vaccine . - What are you gonna do with that ? - What d 'you think ? Violence isn 't the answer . Well , sometimes it 's the only way to get things done , and you know it . Don 't tell me what I know . You really think strangling Fiona Douglas is going to help anything ? - Promise me you won 't touch her again . - Why do you care what happens to her ? I care about what happens to us , what kind of people we 've become . You need to grow up , Anya . This isn 't your nice middle-class world any more . This is the Dark Ages . You get your retaliation in first or you don 't survive . You really don 't get it , do you , Tom ? I wouldn 't live like that . I can 't be with someone who hurts people . I 'm serious . I 'd kill anyone that hurt you . It 's me , open the door . How long are we staying here ? Not long . I 'll cook us some dinner . Beans or soup ? Why are these people are looking for us ? Now , your immune system 's response to the virus , it makes you very special . They want to hurt and exploit you because of that . But why would they hurt me ? Some people will do anything to get what they want . When you came here , I told you I 'd protect you . - Remember ? - Why ? Why are you doing all this for me ? I was a friend of your mother 's . Tell me something , how could you just leave your friends and family to die ? I chose life . Don 't tell me you wouldn 't have done the same thing . I 've done terrible things . I know that . But it has always been about finding a cure . If I can do that , don 't you think I deserve some credit ? How does the vaccine work ? Most flu vaccines target the H and N proteins . H1N1 , so on . But we have been working on something that provokes the immune system by attacking the M2 protein . M2 ? The common factor in all flu viruses . Unlike H and N , it is always the same . - So , what makes Abby so special ? - Her immune system responded by producing antibodies that recognise the M2 protein and beat off the virus . - That makes her unique . - Apart from Peter . Abby gave us the final piece of the jigsaw . When she came here , everything fell into place . I have been working on it night and day since and I am certain that I 've got it right this time . All we have to do now is test it . " 38 , 22 , 95 " . - Will you be OK ? - I can look after myself . It must have been hard for you , these past few months . Living rough isn 't so bad . - Where are you going ? - If anyone comes , all you have to do is take off the safety catch ... then fire . I don 't wanna hurt anyone . They 'll hurt you if they catch you . Do you understand ? - She 's making a fool out of you . - Who ? Fiona Douglas . It must be hard being you , Tom . - Why 's that ? - All you see is ... darkness , hatred , lies . People are capable of much more than that . I just see things for what they are . What do you want ? I want you . Close the door . You know who I am , what I am . I won 't change . Better to stop now before we hurt each other . James , I 've been waiting for you . Sorry . There were complications . The lab 's been contaminated . - And you ? - Well , I 'm fine , as you see . I have the boy . Can you continue your work with the vaccine ? - Yes , but not here . - Well , then , we must get you out . I 'll prepare an evacuation team . Shall we say ... 10am the day after tomorrow ? - It has to be sooner . - We have to take precautions , James . You 'll be bringing the disease with you . I told you , I 'm not ill . We can 't afford to take risks . definitely a link between ... Ah ! Who were you talking to ? Who 's Landry ? Tell me where he is . - Abby ... - Tell me . Kill me and you 'll never see your son again . It 's just bruising . You 'll be fine . My head aches . Give me my son . I can 't do that . You 're not getting out of this room until you tell us where he is . Are you immune to the virus ? Why haven 't you been infected ? Fiona Douglas prepared an antiserum from Abby 's blood . It 's not a vaccine but it offers adequate protection in the short-term . So , when it runs out , you die ? You should think about that . He 'll tell us . He doesn 't want to die in there . Of course we knew Whitaker was reporting to someone . PSJ is ... was a big company . But we assumed they 'd all died of the virus . You thought you were on your own here ? And you have no idea who this Landry is ? I 've never heard of him . Give me some minutes alone with Whitaker , I 'll find Peter for you . - I won 't be party to torture . - You haven 't lost your son . Abby , please , I know what you 're going ... No , you don 't ! You have no idea ! We 're not animals . I want to take a look around with Abby . Might get lucky . - You gonna be all right ? - Fine . This must be where Whitaker was hiding out . So ? He 's gotta be hiding Peter somewhere nearby . Come on . I 'll check things this way - if you want to take a look down there . - OK . Peter . Peter Grant . Peter . Peter . Peter ? Peter ? Peter . Peter , it 's Mum . Peter ! Peter Grant ! This is hopeless . Let 's just keep looking . Did you mean what you said ? About making Whitaker talk ? I don 't care what you do to him . Just get me my son . How you doing ? What do you want ? I want the boy . You 're gonna tell me where he is . Like I said , you 're gonna tell me . He hasn 't said anything yet . Peter 's all he 's got . He 's not gonna give him up that easily . Only a matter of time . We were always afraid the virus would mutate in the bird population . We tested for it constantly . The vaccine had to protect against any variant . So , what happened when you tested it before ? All the volunteers died . Volunteers ? To begin with , their immune systems responded magnificently . I have strengthened the vaccine for a more consistent response . - We have to test it again . - I nominate you . If something happens , we need her . Well , it can 't be Whitaker . Not until he tells us where Peter is . So , it has to be one of us . Abby already has total immunity to all forms of the virus . I 'll do it . I 'm a doctor . I can study the symptoms more effectively . When you 're dead ? Not her . - You can 't speak for me . - It 's not gonna happen . I 'll do it . No . It 'll be all right , Naj . It 's gonna work , isn 't it ? - I hope so . - There you go . She hopes so . - No room for doubt there . - Al , if this is because of Sarah ... - I 'm fine . Let 's move forward . - No , you 're not , you 're grieving . You 're volunteering for all the wrong reasons . Yeah ? So , what are the right reasons ? We 're all on a ledge here , someone 's got to jump off . We 'll inject you with the vaccine first . There shouldn 't be any side effects . Let 's do it . Hurry , hurry , hurry , hurry . Faster ! Come on ! - Whitaker . - Come on , come on . You 're stupid . Would you rather it was Greg ? - Or Anya ? - You 're gonna die ... like Sarah . Everyone I love dies . I have to do this ... so there won 't be any more Sarahs . I need you to understand that . Of course I understand . Do I look thick or something ? You 're doing it cos you think you haven 't got anyone . You have . You 've got me . You 'll start displaying symptoms within a few hours of injecting the mutated virus . Headache , faintness , dry mouth , fever . At that point , the vaccine will kick in . His recovery should be ... almost immediate . Are you sure ? See you on the other side . Good luck . I don 't feel too clever . The mutated virus is attacking your immune system . You 're on schedule . Good to know . So this is what it 's like . It 's too hot . Al ? Al ! This shouldn 't be happening . Do something . There 's nothing I can do . We just have to wait . What 's wrong ? Is the vaccine working ? We won 't know until he wakes up . If he ever does . Sarah ... He 's back . Al ... Al ! Can you hear me ? Water . - How do you feel ? - Give him a minute . We have to know if the vaccine is working . If it isn 't , this is just a temporary reprieve . His temperature is dropping . There are no visible signs of the virus . Oh , my God ! I think the vaccine works ! You have no choice . You have to give us Peter or you don 't get out of here . And if you don 't let me go , Abby never sees her son again . Stalemate . I 'm sure we can find a way forward . Hope never dies . You knew ? But why did you stay behind ? I , er ... got held up . Didn 't get to the airfield . That was where I was supposed to go , wasn 't it ? I 'm sorry . I must have misunderstood you . What does this mean ? It 's just a postcode . " Hope never dies " . - Tell me what it means . - It 's just a form ... Why did I get a card ? I 've no idea . I 'll see you later . What did it feel like , being almost dead ? I don 't know . Don 't remember . I didn 't see God , if that 's what you 're fishing for . He looked after you , though . Someone did . You try . Now , first rule ... don 't point it at me . And again . Try again . I hit it ! Give me that . Leave him alone . - I 'm teaching him how to defend himself . - You 're teaching him how to kill . Go inside . What sort of life do you think he 's gonna have now ? Hm ? If he can 't fight for himself , he 'll die . You know what I dream about , Tom ? A future where things get better . But every time I look at you , I can feel it just slipping away . Fiona . - But I thought ... - That I was dead ? I should be . But I 'm immune . You could have shared the antiserum . But you stole it , all for yourself . In a few days , the serum will wear off . You won 't be immune any more . After what you 've done , I should let it happen . You 're taking the boy to Landry , aren 't you ? Today , if I can . I 've tested the vaccine . It works . Congratulations . We need 21st-century technology to turn it into an effective immunisation programme . Can Landry provide that ? He 's the only person who can . I want in . I want to come with you , to Landry . Can you get me the vaccine ? You think I 'm just gonna hand it over ? Once you 've got it , you won 't need me any more . You 'll betray me . I 'm sorry you think that . All the knowledge I need to make the vaccine is up here . And that 's where it stays until you get me safely to Landry . Whitaker told me the virus started in China . They never said that on the TV . Maybe they didn 't know . The PSJ did . How did they get hold of it months before any health organisation , any government , any journalist ? And why didn 't they say anything ? My family disappeared off the face of the earth . But what if Natalie knew ? Maybe it wasn 't me they were running from . Maybe it was the virus . Once this is over , Fiona and I are going to take the vaccine on the road . I 'm a doctor . I should be helping people . That 's my job . There 's a reason ... I was spared . This is it . I 'm gathering you don 't want me along for the ride ? I don 't think we could ever be happy together . Because you 're gay ? Because ... because we 're not the same ... and we never can be . You want me , I know you do . That 's not enough . What kind of future could we have together ? There is no future . It 's about now , this minute . Y ... y ... you told me that . But we have to believe in something , we have to build on something , otherwise we ... otherwise we 're just animals , scratching round in the mud . Animals are happy enough . We need to end this , Tom . It 's over . Who are you ? My name is Greg Preston . - You 're Landry . - You 're not a PSJ employee , Mr. Preston . Is that who you are ? PSJ ? PSJ was a small part of our organisation . - Where are you ? - That 's none of your concern . Tell me what this means . Well , I think you must already know . It 's a warning . The signal you sent to the chosen few , their cue to get out before the v ... before they were contaminated . How did you keep it a secret ? Wouldn 't you keep silent if your life depended on it ? How many of you are there ? Don 't try to contact me again . There 'll be no response . Goodbye , Greg Preston . Whitaker 's gone . - Fiona 's missing . - The vaccine ? - Still there , she didn 't take it . - They don 't need it . They 've got Peter . - They 're taking him to Landry . - They can 't have got far . - Cars are still here , so they 're on foot . - For now . Abby , Anya , come with me . We 'll check the roads . Tom , take the woods . - Here . - Hey ! What about me ? You should stay here . You 're not well enough . - I 'm fine . - No , you 're not . Naj , look after him . I 've got a car ready . Stop ! Stop ! Peter ! It 's OK . It 's me ! Fiona ... Peter ! This is hopeless . They 've gone . We 've lost them . Tom was right about Fiona . He was right about everything . I 'm sorry . - It was an accident . - It 's not your fault . - I didn 't mean to . - It 's all right . You 're not to blame . You , stay there . Come here , Peter . It 's OK . I 'm a friend . Don 't listen to him . This is one of the men I told you about , the ones who want to hurt you . - Look what he did to me . - Your mum 's alive . She 's here . - I 'll take you to her . - That 's ridiculous ! No , you know that 's a lie . Your mother 's dead . She ... she 's alive ? - She 's alive . - He 's lying , Peter . It 's a cruel ... Shut up . I know you . You 're the man who hijacked Billy 's truck . Billy was nice to me . You 've got it wrong , son . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I 'm your only friend , Peter , the only one who can save you . Come on , I 'll take you to your mother . It 'll only take a couple of minutes ... - Have I killed him ? - Yes . He shouldn 't have lied about my mum like that . You did the right thing . Come on , we have to hurry . - Where are we going ? - Somewhere safe . Any luck ? - The airfield . - What airfield ? If they 're meeting Landry , that 's where they 'll go . You don 't know that . The airfield , the postcard , the lab ... it all fits . Anyway , what else have we got ? We need the vaccine . Why didn 't you tell us about this airfield before ? We didn 't know what it meant . You really think these people escaped the virus and hid somewhere ? It looks that way . Stay here in case Tom gets back . Tell him where we 're going . Hey ... I wanna help . Just stay here ... in case we 're wrong . Ahh ! Uh . What 's that noise ? What noise ? - What does it mean ? - It means Greg was right . Come on . Where are we going ? - To the airfield . - Anya said you should be resting . If you think I 'm gonna stay here , you 're crazy . Are you coming or not ? He 's here . We 're safe . Don 't come any closer , please , James . We must be careful of infection . I 'm protected by the antiserum . You might still be a carrier . We 've kept ourselves safe from the virus for so long , it would be foolish to take any risks now . We 've prepared a quarantine section of the plane . Please restrict yourself to that area alone . You must be Peter . You 're a very welcome guest , Peter . I think you 'll be happy with us . Is it true ? You 've got light and power and stuff ? You didn 't get the virus ? It 's true . We 've made ourselves a little paradise , a paradise you can help us protect . You 'll be given every possible luxury while we examine you . - Examine me ? - It 's just a few tests . No . Peter , come back ! Peter ! Mum ... Mum ! - No , Abby ... - Just stay there , please , Mrs. Grant . If any of you come any closer , I 'll have to kill you . Listen , we ... we 've got the vaccine . Take it . Just give us Peter . Well , let him go ! - Put the case down and step back . - The boy first . Greg , please ! Check it . No ! He won 't be harmed . This is how you did it ? You ... you brought everyone here and then you ... you flew them out ? Well , there were many places like this in many countries , but ... yes . And how many people ? Hundreds ? Thousands ? - Enough . - Enough ? For what ? To help us to rebuild society when the time comes . People with the necessary skills ... leaders , thinkers , planners . Natalie Preston . My wife , was she one of them ? Did she save my children too ? I 'm afraid that name 's unfamiliar to me . She sent me the postcard . " Hope never dies " . It had to be her . You must know . Have you kept any of the vaccine back for yourselves ? Enough for ourselves and our friends . Very sensible . I 'd have done the same in your position . No , please , please ! You 've got what you want . Just let him go . No-one knows yet just how effective this vaccine will be . Perhaps it 'll work , I hope so , but up until then , we need some insurance . I 'm afraid we 'll have to borrow your son - for a little longer . - No ! We had a deal ! You made a business proposal , I 'm obliged to reject it . Take me instead . - Abby ! - Take me . Mum ! No ! This is the place . - There 's Tom ! - Wait ! Come here ! I 've no objection to an exchange , Mrs. Grant . Mum ! Go with Greg . You 'll be OK . I 'll come back for you , I promise . Very well . How did you know about the virus before anyone else ? What really happened in China ? It was your fault , wasn 't it ? You did something . We were testing a genetically engineered virus that would provide a single cure for all forms of flu . It would have been a blessing to humanity . Thousands of lives saved every year . Naj ! There were ... unforeseen interactions with the human immune system . Within days , we ... knew a pandemic was inevitable . You killed ... billions of people ! It ... it was your fault . We had the very best of intentions . Peter ! Let him go ! - Abby , Abby ! - No ! Hey , hey , hey ! Listen to me . Wait here . Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Argh ! I 'm sorry . I couldn 't . It 's OK , Naj . It 's OK . You guys stay here . Keep hold of the boy . You can 't just let them go . Let him go ! Let Peter go ! Take the vaccine . The boy stays . The vaccine will be mass produced , everyone will be provided for . You have my word . Mum ! Mum ! - I 'm sorry . - It 's OK , it 's OK . It 's OK , you 're safe . - Anya ! - Naj ! Anya . - What are you doing here ? - We couldn 't just sit around . Hey , Peter ! Nice to meet you at last . Hey ... Do you think he was lying about your wife ? - Didn 't she send you the card ? - I don 't know . Come on . Let 's get going . We should find Tom . - He was just ahead of us . - He was here ? He was in the control tower , took out the gunman . - Well , where is he , then ? - I dunno . He was shot . - Shot ? ! - He was OK , though , he was on his feet . He ... he might have collapsed somewhere ... - Anya , it 's OK . Tom , he 'll be fine . - He 's probably just resting up . We have to find him . Tom !

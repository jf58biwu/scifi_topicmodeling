 Subs created by : David Coleman . â™ª Two ... two , three ... [ Door whooshes open ] Hey , guys . Remember Carlos , the elderly one-legged cowboy who lives next door ? I beat him up and took his hat ! It 's really nice . I hope he 's not hurt too bad . Come on ! Let 's go to a redneck bar . [ Others cheering ] [ Country music playing ] Wha ... ? It 's called line dancing , Professor . It 's fun because there 's no touching and lots of rules . Hey , look , a mechanical buggalo ! Out of my way , losers ! I have a way with bucking mechanical things . Yep . [ Sultrily ] : Hey , baby . I 'm Bender . [ Feedback squeals ] Ooh-whee ! Gather ' round , yokel wannabes ! This here city slicker 's about to get his nuts bolted ! Oh , yeah ? If I don 't set a new club record , I 'll eat my hat . [ Bell rings , buzzer sounds ] 0.4 seconds ! A new club record for shortest ride . [ Cheers and applause ] Told you ! Yee-haw ! Still , someone should eat the hat . [ Slurping , munching ] [ Bell dings ] [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] [ Grunts ] [ Cheers and applause ] [ Bell dings ] [ Screams ] Oh , my . [ Bell dings ] [ Grunting ] [ Screams ] [ Sighs ] [ Screams ] [ Bell dings ] [ Giggles ] Oh ! Whoa ! [ Gasping ] [ Screaming ] Something 's wrong ! Turn it off before she barfs up her bucket of hot wings ! [ Screaming ] It 's not responding ! Command Center , override ! Override ! [ Rapid beeping ] Oh , no . It 's achieved consciousness ! God forgive us for creating this . Make it stop ! Oh , God , please make it stop ! [ Screaming ] [ Crowd screaming ] Look out , little drunk Sheila ! [ Screaming ] [ Whimpers ] [ Buzzer sounds ] 48.3 seconds ! We got us a winner ! [ Cheers and applause ] Oh , thank God you 're all right and won us a free steak dinner . Why didn 't you let go ? My hand is stuck ! There must be glue on the saddle ! [ Grunting ] Relax . Let maybe a doctor take a look . Ah , just as I had no idea . You 're breaking out in suction cups . Ewe ! Why is that happening ? And will I have to die listening to country music ? Not if I can get you to a better doctor . We 'll have to hurry-he doesn 't have much time ! [ Popping ] [ Siren wailing ] What is it , Dr. Tenderman ? Is it serious ? I 'm afraid these suction cups are merely the first phase of a process called " squidification " . [ All gasp ] I probably gave it to you ! Sometimes I don 't wash my hands for years at a time . I 'm afraid it 's a genetic condition that sometimes affects mutants . Your limbs will gradually transform into a slithering mass of ... - Tentacles . - Oh , God ! So , how many cures are there for this disease ? I 'm afraid ... none . The only treatment is an incredibly expensive operation that just delays the symptoms for a few months . [ Crying ] : Oh ! I wish I 'd never been born ! [ Crying ] Damn it . Why me ? ! There are still so many things I wanted to let go of ! Leela , no matter what happens , no matter what kind of monster you turn into ... It won 't change the way I feel about you . Zoidberg ? [ Popping ] [ Water rushing in distance ] [ Crying ] It 's like I 'm cursed ! Isn 't it bad enough that I occasionally lay an egg ? Now I have to become a squid , too ? ! [ Crying ] Aw , Sweetie , tentacles are beautiful . I mean , look at your Mother here . She 's so gorgeous , you hardly even notice the tentacles . And if you 're worried , you can always move down here with us . In the sewer , you 'll fit right in . [ Sloshing ] Sewer mail ! [ Singsong ] : He 's single . I don 't care if that operation will only delay the tentacles . Somehow , we got to find a way to pay for it . [ Sighs ] It 's no use . There 's absolutely no way we can afford to ... Wait ! We 'll sell Ol ' Bessie ! Fry , take the old gal to market and get the best darn price you can . [ Others cheering ] Yeah , I will ! Yeah , all right ! [ Cowbell ringing ] Come on , Ol ' Bessie . Man : Warp drives ! Get your warp drives ! [ Whistles ] Say , friend , that 's a heck of a ship . She 's worth a lot of money . I 'm gonna sell her at market so my girlfriend can get surgery for her squidification . [ Whistles ] Jeepers , my wife had that . Got sicker and sicker , and in the end ... We found a miracle cure ! Giant beans ? They must be worth a fortune ! These babies are the jewels of the bean kingdom . But since you 're in a jam , I 'll trade ' em for that ship of yours . Hmm . I don 't know . They 're the cure-all that cures a lot ! Rheumatism , botulism , seborrhea , diarrhea , desiccation , perspiration , common cold and , uh ... Um , uh ... Squidification ? If you say so . Wait a second . How could beans possibly cure her ? Because they 're magic ! They fell from the sky ! Oh , now you tell me ! I did it ! I got a great deal on the ship ! Hooray ! I knew you wouldn 't let us down in any way . Well , how much did you get ? Two ! Two magic beans ! [ Groans ] : Ooh ! You sack of bags of buckets of idiots ! There 's no such thing as magic beans ! [ Sighs ] : Oh . " Fry , you big dummy " ? Very much so . Whatever you 're trying to do , I appreciate it . But this is one of those rare problems with no magic solution . [ Crickets chirping ] You look sad . You want to go down to the phone store and check out the new ring tones ? No . It 's been a weird day . I 'm just gonna stay here and think for a while . Okay . [ Kisses , pops ] Leela : To my wonderful friends , words can 't express how thoughtful you 've been . I don 't want to make you suffer through this with me , so I 've decided to move underground to the sewer . I 'll miss several of you , but I know it 's the right thing to do . Please , don 't try to contact me down there . It 'll only make things harder . Good-bye . [ Grunts ] That 's new . Eh , I 'll take the beanstalk less traveled . [ Grunting ] [ Grunting ] Wow . I 've never been up this high before . Well , outer space , I guess . [ Rumbling ] Whoa ! It 's collapsing ! What the ... [ Grunting ] It 's some kind of deluxe apartment in the sky . [ Laughs ] Oh . [ Sniffs ] [ Gasps ] [ Slurping ] [ Burps ] [ Neighs ] It 's like a Fairy Tale ! Finally , a turn for the better . [ Choking ] Gotcha . This situation deteriorated fast . [ Humming ] Whoa ! We 've been weed-whacked ! Whoa , check out that giant ... [ Screams ] [ Thud ] Your intruder , Mother . [ Gasps ] That is one skugly critter . [ Grunts ] I 'm not an animal , I 'm a mutant being , and I demand to know where I am . There . Leela : Momsanto ? Yes , you 've discovered my floating genetic engineering facility . Our experiments would be illegal on Earth , but up here , I 'm above the law . [ Laughs ] Nice pun , Mother . It 's not a pun , it 's a play on words ! Come on , I 'll show you the lab . This is Colossus ... the beanstalk project . Ordinary beans are a magical fruit , but they 're tiny and pathetic . So we spliced elephant DNA into their chromosomes for added heft . [ Trumpets ] [ Beeping ] [ Buzzes ] So those magic beans are actually genetically engineered ? You can 't just meddle with life like that . Who do you think you are ... God ? I wish . Then I could stop these things from collapsing under their own weight . Why are you committing these atrocities against nature ? Nature 's out of its league . There are 40 billion hungry people on this planet , many of whom will pay top dollar for one of my pine-u-porks . [ Snorts ] Find yourself a porcupine , blast some pig DNA into it , microwave till juicy . [ Bell dings ] And bang ! You 've got a cocktail treat complete with built-in toothpicks . [ Chewing noisily ] Dare I even ask what horrors are behind that door ? It 's where I keep my warning signs , all right ? Stop asking questions ! Fine . Can I go now ? The only place you 're going is nowhere . You 've got some freaky DNA , and I want to see what 's in your genes . [ Snickers ] Genes with a " G " ! Ow ! Now , that 's a pun . Oh ! I miss Leela so much . Last night in the bathtub , I ate a whole box of taco shells . Yes , I was there . I know she said not to contact her , but it 's been three weeks . I 'm going to fall down that manhole again and visit her . [ Ringing ] Leela 's wrist thingy . How can I help you ? Fry , where 's Leela ? We haven 't seen her since she sprouted tentacles . What ? ! She didn 't move down there ? ! Then where is she ? That 's what I called to ask you . Well , you didn 't ! I 've got to figure out where Leela went . I just need some kind of clue . Ow ! [ Gasps ] Leela 's boot . Where did it come from ? I think it fell from the sky , but I 'm not sure . Now I 'm sure . [ Both gasping ] Whoa ! Whoa ! [ Both screaming ] [ Both grunt ] Whoa ! Remember that mural on my cousin 's van ? It 's like it came to life ! I keep telling you , we didn 't grow up together . Leela : Help , help ! [ Gasps ] Leela , don 't worry , we 're here to rescue you ! How do we get up there ? I 'll let my hair down and you can climb up ! That 's not hair . I don 't care what it is . I just like climbing . Holy Rapunzel , man-bat ! There 's a duo here to rescue us ! How dynamic are they ? Not very . Go about your business , citizens . Well , back to being the subject of gruesome genetic experiments , old chum . [ Gasping ] Ow ! Oh ! Yah ! Oh ! Ee ! [ Grunts ] [ Chuckles ] Oh , Leela , it 's so great to see your beautiful face again . Let me give you a hug . Uh , okay . Go in that corner . It 's the hugging corner . You , too , Bender . Instead , I went to bed because I 'm tired now . This is about your tentacles , isn 't it ? Look , Leela , there 's nothing about your body that could ever shock me , so ... [ Screams ] That is nasty ! Sorry I screamed , Leela . I was just so ... excited to see you . Yeah . Let 's just get out of here . No problem . I 'll bend the door open . You can 't bend a wooden door ! [ Hushed ] : I know that , and you know that . But this door looks pretty stupid . [ Grunting ] [ Grunts ] [ Gasps ] What time is it ? Time for you to shut up ! [ Hisses ] [ Both scream ] Quick , in here ! [ Gasping ] [ Grunting ] [ All panting ] We 'll be safe in this utter darkness . [ Low growling ] Hey , maybe one of these switches turns off that scary noise . [ Growling continues ] [ All scream ] Fee-fi-fo-fum ! You had me at " fee " ! It 's another one of Mom 's genetic monstrosities ! Poor thing . We 've got to help him . I thought we were in a hurry to escape , but whatever . It 's okay , big guy . We won 't let her hurt you anymore . [ Roars ] [ Gasping ] [ Screaming ] [ Sighs ] [ Roars ] [ Screams ] [ Growls ] [ Screams ] [ Grunting ] Well , look what the giant cat dragged in . Memo to self ... breed giant cat to drag things in . You 're not breeding any giant thing ! It 's reckless and irresponsible , and we 're going to stop you . Yeah ! Even if it means crashing this ship with us in it . Yeah ! Wait . Crashing what with who in it ? [ All screaming ] Don 't worry , Mother , we 'll save ... [ grunts ] Mm , mm , mm . Mama knows what I like ! Huh ? The sky is falling ! I say , I say , the sky is falling ! [ Squawks ] [ People screaming ] [ All gasping ] [ All gasping ] And remember , don 't report them missing till after we max out their credit cards . Squid attack ! Hit the deck ! [ All gasp ] We 're back , baby . And we brought you a little something . [ Grunts ] [ All gasp ] It 's okay . Leela 's just changed a little . More than a little . She 's beautiful ! Listen , Fry , whatever it was that you and I had together ... Goulash ? No ! Well , I don 't know . Maybe it was goulash . But it can 't really continue . What are you talking about ? I want to spend my life with you . No , you don 't . I mean , look at me . Big deal . Looks change . No matter what happens , you 'll always be Leela , the woman I love . Thank you , Fry . [ Both moaning quietly ] Ah , there you are , Leela . I just wanted to thank you for helping me engineer the perfect bean . You 've made me a very richer woman . What ? ! I would never help you commit your perverted crimes against nature ! My marigolds ! Thanks to that DNA sample you generously donated while locked in my tower , my beanstalks now have suction cups to keep them from collapsing . That 's horrible ! Is it ? Now the world 's starving masses have a cheap , abundant source of nutrition . But not too cheap . I 'll take the cash , and you can have the credit . I don 't want the credit ! Genetic engineering is wrong ! Oh , really ? Tell that to your old friend , the giant . [ Screams ] Where is he ? ! Oh , God , he 's invisible now ! Fee-fi , hi . [ Chuckles ] I 'm Stan . Ah-ha ! You see ? I freed him from your infernal contraption and he returned to normal . On the contrary , I suffer from hereditary Gigantism . Or I did , until Mom cured me of my awful disease using genetic engineering . That 's why she had me hooked up in her lab . Oh , well , congratulations . You look great . But , even if genetic engineering feeds the hungry , and cures some giant guy ! That doesn 't make it right . We have no idea what the long term affects will be . And once that genie is out of the bottle ... I can cure you too . Okay I 'm in .

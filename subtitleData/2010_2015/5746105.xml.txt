 Good morning . On this day , July 1st , 2014 , at this hour , 0600 . We are at the very first airport in the world ... The CW-7 , which despite being the topic of so much controversy over the past 7 years , has continued development . Protests from environmental groups and a number of developing countries continue ... It has been claimed that CW-7 is the answer to global warming . And we are witnessing it ! World leaders , who argue that global warming can no longer be ignored , today 79 countries will begin dispersing CW-7 into the upper layers of the atmosphere . Spray out into the upper layers of the atmosphere and surprisingly bring down average global temperatures to the finest levels . It is just a day away that our long time crisis of global warming ... According to scientists , the artificial cooling substance CW-7 will succeed in bringing average global temperatures down to manageable levels , as a revolutionary solution to mankind 's warming of the planet . Head check ! Alright . Get in line . Everybody sit down . One , two , three , four , five , six ... Keep going - Go on . Hey you . Sit down ! Curtis , sit down . Sit down ! I said sit down ! - What the fuck are you doing ? - Counting . Can 't you sit and count ? You wanna get shot ? You 're crazy . Shut up , Edgar . I 'm thinking . Are there any experienced violinists here ? Raise your hands ! Violinist ! Stand up , come forward . Food ! Come and get it . Violinists ? They 're having a laugh ? Those bastards in the Front Section , think they own us . Eating steak dinners and listening to string quartets and that . We 'll be different when we get there . I want steak . Excuse me sir ! My wife and I played violin in the Boston Symphony Orchestra . I was first chair . Can you still play ? Of course . You never forget . Show me your hands . You . Follow me . Leave your belongings , we just need your hands . Not both ' ? Yes . Both hands . My wife , Doris , plays beautifully . Better than me even . They just need one person . Then I won 't go . Doris , Doris . Sit down everyone . - Sit down , Edgar . - They can 't just ... Sit down . Fucking bastards Now isn 't the time . Well when is the time ? Soon . Doris , I 'll be back Doris . It 's alright . I 'll come back . What does the steak taste like again ? I had it once , but I can 't remember ... If you can 't remember then it 's better to forget . Alright then , what does it , what does it smell like when it 's cooking and that ? When it emanates around the place . Curtis , is this it ? It 's not it . And I 've heard this ... Curtis ! Here ! Tim-bo - how 's it hanging buddy ? Give me a pound ! Blow up ! Hey , listen . I think I need that protein block . How about I trade you ? This one for that one ? No . Nice bargaining Curtis . Here . Give me this one , I 'll give you that . Hey , relax , relax . Come here , Timmy . Come here . Come right ... I have an idea . I 'll give you this one and that one for that one . What do you say ' ? No . Go get him . Timmy ! Timothy ! Your mom 's gonna give you a damn good spanking ! Where the fuck he went ? Hey , come here . Come here . Give us it . Give us it . You 're alright Jose , how you doing man ? Timmy ! Work with me here ! Edgar , why did you let him get up there ? No , I didn 't . He got up there by himself . He 's very nimble . He 's five . He 's very nimble five years old . Timmy ! Sweetie , come down . Come here . What do you want for it ? In the whole wide train ? In the whole wide train . The ball ! The ball ? No , no , I 'm sorry , I can 't do that . I cant ' do that . Yes . I get the ball for a whole hour . Done . Curtis . Is it time ' ? Not yet , Tanya . Soon . Red letter ? Yeah . It 's the one we 've been waiting for . Our informant gave us the name . N , A , M , K , U ... Nam Kung Min Soo . He 's a security expert . He 's in the Prison Section now . Wait ! You 're joking , right ! - He 's in prison ? - Hey , out of here . No , I 'm just saying , what kind of chance do we have ... Edgar . I just think that if this guys says that he 's such a great security expert why can 't he just break himself ... ? That 's enough ! Go ! Let 's go Tim . Come on . Let 's go . Edgar just wants to help , you know . He thinks the world of you . He shouldn 't worship me the way he does . I 'm not who he thinks I am . Few of us ever are . Alright . We 're here , Tail Section , Quarantine Section , Prison Section . Gate , Gate , Gate Four seconds all three gates are opened at once . We have four seconds to go through three gates and bust Nam out . Then Nam gets us the rest of the way ? Our fate depends on this man ? Yeah . If we can get him to cooperate , he can take us all the way to the front of the train . Very front section . Yeah . From here right to the front of the train . Everything in one stroke . We control the engine , we control the world . Without that , we have nothing . All past revolutions failed because they couldn 't take the engine . What you saying ? This time , we take the engine . Then what ? We kill him . Wilford ? You should run the train now , not Wilford ! I 'm a shadow of my former shadow . My day was decades ago . How old is Gilliam ? Shut up , Edgar . And listen , I 'm not saying that I want that to happen , that 's not what I 'm saying . What I mean is he will die someday . And when that happens you 're gonna have to take over . You 're gonna have to run the train . I 'm not a leader . I don 't know . I think you 'd be pretty good if you ask me . Hey , Edgar . How far back can you remember ? - I don 't know , like what ? - Your mother . You remember her ? I can remember her face , every once in a while ... But , it 's not clear . Stay down everybody . Everybody stay in your place . Don 't fucking look at me ! Keep it down , keep it down ! Medical Inspection . All the kids . All the kids come with me . Just the kids . All the kids . Stay back there ! Stay back there ma 'am . Stay back . Hello , what 's this ? We have one more . Yup , Come . No , no , nothing wrong with him . It 's just a medical check , sir . You just stay back there . You just stay back there . You ! Go and check ! Don 't move ! Stay there ! Go Timmy , go ! Timmy ! That 's her baby ! Andy ! Give me back my son , you fucking bitch ! Andy ! Andy ! How did you let him throw his shoe ? Timmy ! At this altitude , we need only 7 minutes . Seven minutes allotted for your speech , sir . This is so disappointing . This is so disappointing . This is so disappointing . This is so ... No no , we don 't need all that - we 've only got seven minutes . Passengers . This is not a shoe . This is disorder . This is size ten chaos . This - see this - this is death . In this locomotive we call home , there is one thing that between our warm hearts and the bitter cold . Clothing ? Shields ? No ! Order ! Order is the barrier that holds back the frozen death . We must - all of us on this Train of life remain in our allotted stations . We must each of us occupy ... our , pre-ordained par-tic-u-lar position ! Would you wear a shoe on your head ? Of course you wouldn 't wear a shoe on your head . A shoe does not belong on your head . A shoe belongs on your foot . A hat belongs on your head . I am a hat and you are a shoe . I belong on the head - you belong on the foot . Yes ? So it is . In the beginning , order was prescribed by your ticket . First class , economy , and free loaders like you ! Eternal order is prescribed by the Sacred Engine . All things flow from the Sacred Engine . All things in their place , all Passengers in their Section , all water flowing , all heat rising pays homage to the Sacred Engine ... in its own par-ti-cu-lar pre-ordained position . So it is . Now , as in the beginning , I belong to the front , You belong to the tail . When the foot seeks the place of the head , a sacred line is crossed . Know your place ! Keep your place ! Be a shoe ! We have 42 seconds left . So ... we could go to a comments of Mr. Wilford , the Divine Keeper of the Sacred Engine . Sir ? Mr. Wilford ? Are you there ? Are you there sir ? It 's breaking off . Mr. Wilford is a very busy man . So it is ! - Are we just gonna watch ? - Not now . I 'm not just gonna fucking sit here ... No , I 'm alright . Stop . Stop right there . Sit down ! Put that useless gun down , put it away . Long time no see , Mr. Gilliam . It 's pleasure . You look healthy . He 's fine . Minister Mason . Please deliver a message to Mr. Wilford . Certainly , what shall I say ? Tell him , he and I need to talk . Well . You can talk to me . Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here ... Not here . At the front . Your son will be a hero . Promise . Or daughter , whatever it is . I got it , I got it . Your contribution has been duly noted . Thanks . ( Japanese ) Nan da yo ! So sorry to interrupt while you 're praying . What are you doin ' man ? So sorry . Su-mi-ma-sen . Look . There 's your Budda back , thanks very much . Move , move , move ! Stop fooling around ! I 've got a better batch . Stronger , fresh , uncut . Wanna try some ? How many protein blocks for ten rocks of uncut Kronole ? They don 't have bullets . Why do you say that ? You remember what Mason said ? She said - put down that " useless " gun . She meant she would not give the order to shoot me . No . No - I think the guns are literally useless They used up all their bullets four years ago , in the last revolt . Bullets are extinct . If you 're wrong , we could be finished before we even start . I think we should be patient , wait for the next red letter . Stay together . Left and right . Not yet . Up up . Now left , to the left . Good , now forward . Hello , Andrew ! Andrew ! Wake up , rise and shine , when you dream too much of the sun , you forget the trees . I believe this is your son . I 'm , I 'm sorry , it 's not very good , it 's not my best work , it 's a little dark But if you look very deep into the eyes , you can see little bit of hope . What about my boy ? You 've got one of Timmy ? Yes , Tanya , I do . Easy , easy . Come off this easy . You 'll hurt yourself . Here , there you go . Timmy . Look at him . Funny little smile . Curtis , you gotta let me come with you . No Tanya , I 'm sorry . You will be , if you don 't let me come . I 'm going to the front and I 'ma make that bitch sorry she put her hands on my boy . Make this one tighter . You know I 'm stronger than all these skinny ass soldiers anyway . Please ! Oh shit , what 's going on ' ? They changed the schedule , boys . Move it back ! Now or never ! They 're coming now ! Don 't panic ! Stick with the plan . Hide that ! Hide it in your clothes ! Hide weapons in your clothes ! Head check . Line up . Alright sit down . One , two , three , four ... What the fuck do we do ? I had enough of this protein block bullshit ! Yea , this is bullshit ! We 're fucking hungry man ! I want chicken ! Chicken ! It 's OK ! You want him fucking dead ? Is that it ' ? Be quiet ! Still going for it , are we ? Come on , let 's go ! Let 's do it . The rifles . No , we can overwhelm them . We easily outnumber their bullets . This is it ' ? Curtis come on . We are out of time and you gotta do it now . THEY 'VE GOT NO BULLETS ! THEY 'VE GOT NO BULLETS ! I 'm fine , Grey . You go ! Now . 'Nam Koong Min Soo .. Kronol Addict' That explains a lot , doesn 't it ? Hurry up Edgar . Hurry " P ? So sorry for keeping you all waiting . Obviously I work here . Open it . Here we go ! Hey , Kronole head ! So , this is Kronole ? I heard it 's pretty big in the front section . Careful , that 's how these guys get hallucinate . It 's an industrial waste . And it 's highly flammable . Are you Nam Koong Min Soo ? Security specialist ? Did you design all the door-locks and security systems on the train ? Look at him , man , he 's gone , look at his eyes , he 's fried his brain with that fucking shit ? Are you Nam ? Nam , are you listening ? Yes , I 'm listening Unknown words found . Please try again with correct vocabulary . We need your help . For what ? We 're going to the front and we need you to open up the gates . What if I say no ? Uncut , straight from the barrel . Every door you open , you get one lump of Kronole . Jesus , Marlboro Lights ? ! I can 't believe it . Cigarettes have been extinct for more than 10 years now . Do you want some asshole ? I bet you fuckhead never smoked one before ? I 'm gonna make this real simple for you . You help us , you get your drug . If not , we put you back where we found you . What 'll it be , asshole ?

Looks like they left in a hurry ! There 's some food on the table . This can 't be a window , can it ? Still cold . Dead . All dead . Alright ! Let 's go everyone ! Stay focus . We didn 't come here for this . Alright ! You heard the man . Let 's go ! Move ! NAM ! Nam ! Kronole ! How did you know there was nobody there ? He 's running . Paul ? Paul !

It 's Curtis ! Ain 't comin ' back ... so now I got to do it Manually ! Ah ha - so that 's how it 's made . Still hot . Look at them all ! Man , you did some nice work ! That 's right , man ! There 's your food , there 's your protein blocks ! Is this why they took you ? To make this garbage ? Paul ? You 've been alone this whole time ? Alone ! In the zone ! We 're going to the front . Come with us ! Oh , right ! You 're going to the front ? Yeah , man ! But , No no way man . My place is here . Alright ? Here ? Making this crap ? Why ? You can 't draw this . Okay . All this time , we 've been eating this shit ? I eat them , too , you know . Every single day . Where did you get this ? Have you been the one writing this ? I don 't write ' em . Why do you have this ? Who gave this to you ? They just leave ' em for me . I put them into protein blocks . I send them on , that 's it ! The Water Supply Section ? Yeah . It 's a few cars up . It 's where the water 's cleansed and recycled . It 's one of the most crucial sections in the train . If we take it - will we have the upper hand ? We won 't even have to get all the way to the very front . We control the water , we control the negotiation . Mmmm , hi , excuse me . Sorry to bother you there , can I get you a glass of water or something to speed this up ? Listen ! Would you get on with it ? You 're keeping us all fucking waiting ! Yes , I did . Yeah , you are . Although you 've been fucking smelling that flammable shit , that time is probably distant fucking concept for you , isn 't it ? Of course , I 'm only doing this for Kronole Here we go again , Kronole this , Kronole that , - Christ almighty man do some fucking work ! - You 're the one who gives it to me Have you been thick ? That 's what you asked for , each time you open a gate ! Of course , I 'm only doing this for Kronole Yona ? It 's Yona , right ? How old are you ? Seventeen . Seventeen . You 're a train baby , then ? How ' bout you ? 17 years on earth , 17 years in the Tail Section . Earth ? What was it like ' ? I don 't remember . Why ? I don 't want to remember anything before I met Gilliam . Yona . Are you clairvoyant ? Clairvoyant ? What 's that ? You always seem to know what 's behind the gates . You see things in your mind ? Don 't open it . What ? Lock the gate ! Be careful . Yeah , you too . Team 2 move ! Move forward ! Passing Yekaterina Bridge ! Passing Yekaterina Bridge ! We 're at the bridge , guys ! 10 , 9 . 3 , 7 , 6 . 5 , 4 . 3,2,1 . Happy New Year ! Fucking hate getting old , fucking hate it . Wilford banzai ! Banzai ! Everybody down ! Hang on ! IMPACT ! Not yet ! A second one ! Stay down . Nam , what are you doing man ? What are you doing ? He 's high as a fucking kite . Here it comes Safe passage ! Safe passage ! Come on , give it to me ! One two three one . Happy Yekaterina Bridge , you filthy ingrates ! You people , who if not for the benevolent Wilford , would have frozen solid 18 years ago today ! You people , who have sucked on the generous titty of Wilford ever since , for food and shelter ! And now ... in front of our hallowed water supply section , no less , you repay his kindness with violent hooliganism ? You scumbs . Precisely 74 % of you shall die ! My friend - you suffer from the misplaced optimism of the doomed . This is going to be good . What ? What did you say ? He said you guys are fucked . You stupid Tail sectioners . There 's a tunnel right after Yekaterina Bridge . A tunnel ? Yea , a fucking long one ! Let 's go Everybody back ! Everybody , get back ! Chan , Chan . Get outta here . Just get out . Chan ! We need fire ! Chan ! Bring the fire ! Tell it to the back we need to bring lights up here ! Chan has the matches ! Crush you motherfucker ! Officer Fuyu ! What are you doing , you dozy boger ? Don 't look at me , look there ! Put me down , stop squeezing my legs . Surrender ! Surrender ! He will kill me if we don 't surrender ! Shit ... Curtis ! Stop ! Stop everybody ! Drop your weapon . Stop ! Everybody stop ! Do what he says , Christ ... for crying out loud . Drop your weapons ! Don 't look Survivors wash yourselves . The Water Supply Section . Wash away the blood . Have you seen these kids ? I don 't know anything about ... Look ! Where are they , you bitch ? I don 't know , I don 't know . It 's not me . Tell us or I 'll cut your fucking arm off ! Even shorter than mine , you bastard ! Wilford ... Wilford knows . Wilford likes kids . He does . That 's why that yellow one Claude to get them for him ... It 's ... it 's Wilford you want , not me . Wilford likes kids ? All he cares about is his wretched engine ! The Engine is Sacred . And Wilford is Divine . Wilford is merciful . Call him - see if he will come and save you . Yes . Wilford the merciful . Call him . He won 't come here . He won 't leave his Engine . We 're going to rip you into little pieces . He still won 't come ? We control the water . If we turn that off , he ' ll have to come . Turn off the water ? You 'd only be condemning your own people . The water comes from the front . The nose of the train breaks up the snow and ice and turns it into water . Like an elephant 's trunk the water comes in the mouth not the bum . Curtis ! Yes , Wilford knows you well . Curtis Everett . He 's been watching you . And we know you won 't harm your own people . Too bad you couldn 't save your own second in command . - What was his name , Edgar ? - Shut the fuck up ! Curtis ! Curtis ! I can help you . You can fucking die is what you can do . No , I can help you . I swear it . Listen , listen to me ! Wilford won 't come here . He 's not coming . You 've got to go to him . And I can take you . I know the train . I can guarantee you safe passage . Why the fuck would I trust you ? Because I want to live . So you 'd sell out Wilford the Benevolent ? If I take you to the front , you 'll have to kill him . I 'll get you close enough . You kill him and let me live . Curtis ? You 're still determined to push ahead ? Of course . We 're not even half way . You 've already made it farther than anyone else . Farther than MacGregor four years ago . Ten cars , twenty cars , it doesn 't matter unless we make it to the engine . They 'll just regroup and attack us again . We gotta pull them out by the roots . But , so many have been killed . We 've lost so many . I know . Have you seen our men ? They are exhausted . I told them to wash themselves , so that I could access the damage . Let me go ahead . I 've got Mason now - I can move a lot faster . You stay here with the wounded . Guard the prisoners . When we take the engine I 'll call for you to lead us . Stop it , Curtis . Why are you doing that ? You know very well that you 're already our leader . You have to accept that now . How can I lead if I have two good arms ? It 's faded a lot . It 's better to have both arms . You can 't do a lot with one , you know . Especially when you hold a woman , it 's much better with two arms . Wouldn 't you agree ? When you get to the narrow bridge , big gate with the W on it . Wilford 's behind that . Don 't let Wilford talk . Cut out his tongue . OK let 's all get in there , squeeze in ! Perfect , perfect ! The hat comes you well . Now Grey ... you must go with Curtis . Oops , we 've forgot somebody . Kronole ! Don 't mind me . Back to work , everyone , back to work . Miniser Are you okay ? I 'm okay Please don 't eat it , don 't eat it . No - no - they 're friendly . They won 't bite . Well , they might bite the tomatoes . Can I eat this ' ? Train baby like you wouldn 't know I used to walk on this every day Under the snow this is everywhere Earth ! What 's this ? It 's moving Over there What 's that ? Hey . Do any of you feel like sushi ? Hell yeah , line that shit up . Right ? You people are very lucky . This is only served twice in a year , in January and July . Why ? Not enough fish ? " Enough " is not the criterion . Balance . You see , this aquarium is a closed ecological system . The number of individual units must be very closely , precisely controlled in order to maintain the proper sustainable balance . No . You eat this . You know what that 's made of ? Dig in ! Curtis , my friend , do you think we might dispense with the restraints for this next Section ? I am not your friend and why would I ? For the sake of the young ? Education ? Quiet ! Quiet ! Good morning children . I am pleased to present guests from the Tail Section . Yes and what do we say to Tail Section guests , children ? Good morning Tail Section guests . Timmy ! Timmy ! Andy ! Andy ! Andrew ... This little boy . His name is Timmy . This is my son . Please , Take a good look at the picture ! I saw them ! - When ? - Where ? Came through there , went through there . Is that all ? Boy ? Yes . Were they crying ? No , but they looked like they wanted to . I heard all Tail Sectioners were lazy dogs who sleep all day in their own shit . No , they 're very nice . And very just and merciful . So it is . Minister Mason , we were just about to show a video . Very good ! Wilford ! From a very young age , Mr. Wilford 's love of locomotives was apparent . When I grow up , I want to live in a train . Forever ! Forever ! His early dreams were realized when he founded his transportation empire the Wilford Industries . But his greatest dream was to construct a luxury locomotive ' cruise ' line Connecting the railways of the entire world into one ! A circular railway that extends for 438,000 kilometers and completes one circle every year . Impervious to the extreme cold of the Arctic and the scorching heat of the African desert . Wilford 's miracle train is self-sustaining and possesses the most sophisticated designs and advanced technology known ... As hard as it is to believe , people in the Old World made fun of Mr. Wilford . They criticized him for over-engineering and over-equipping this wonderful train . But Wilford knew something they did not . And what was that ? Old World people were frigging morons who got turned into popsicles ! Well , sort of . Mr. Wilford knew that CW-7 would freeze the world . So what did the prophetic Mr. Wilford invent to protect the chosen from that calamity ? The engine ! Rumble rumble rattle rattle It will never die ! What happens if the engine stops ? We all freeze and die But will it stop , will it stop ? No ! No ! Can you tell us why ? The engine is eternal . Yes ! The engine is forever . Yes ! Rumble rumble ! Rattle rattle ! Who is the reason why ? Wilford - Wilford , Wilford , hip hooray ! I love that one , such a tonic . Oh , it 's time , children . Come this way . Don 't trip now ! Don 't push ! There 's plenty of room . Who can tell me what 's coming up ? The Frozen Seven ! Pay attention . This tableau will surely be on the exam ! Fifteen years ago , in the 3rd year of the train , seven passengers tried to stop Wilford 's Miracle Train and go outside ! And what do we call this event , Magdalena ? The Revolt of the Seven . Very good - long before you were born . Of course , they failed to stop the train . Instead , they jumped out of the running train . Here they come now . You look too Why ? There they are . That 's how far they made it . That person in the front ... was a cleaning lady from the front section She was an Inuit . You know , Eskimo She taught me about every type of snow and ice She believed we could survive outside the train If we ever go outside the train ? We 'd all freeze and die ! If the engine stops running ? We 'd all die ! And who takes care of the sacred engine ? Sir Wilford ! Children ! It 's the New Year Eggs from Mr. Wilford ! Touch them , they are still warm . These eggs are boiled using water heated by the Sacred Engine itself . As a special treat , we have playing for us , the world-renowned first chair violinist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra . Mr. Gerald Mclnster ! Is that really Gerald ? He looks damn great ! No thank you very much . Let 's go , Curtis . ( Icelandic ) Happy New Year ! I thought the chicken was extinct . There are actually many things on board that are rumored to be extinct . Such as ? This ! Andrew ! No . It wasn 't me ! It wasn 't me ! No . Curtis ! You have to lead us . Curtis my friend . We understand each other . Listen to my words ! It wasn 't me ! We go forward . Open ! Hurry ! It 's Mason . Shit . Check her pulse . Hey , hey , fire regulation ... God , that does not look good . He 's coming Got the master key , right ? Wait , don 't shoot . Please don 't shoot . You just killed a Front Section Passenger ! I 'm ... I didn 't see a thing . Where are you going ? Wait , just wait a minute ! Can 't we talk about this for one ... You son of a bitch ! Close the door . Tanya . Oh ... My Timmy . My Timmy . We 're gonna find him . I promise . I know . Thank you . You grab some too Hey , turn around motherfucker . You got my Kronole ! I 'm gonna fucking kill you ! I 'm coming after you ! Open the door . Come on , Kronole ! Kronole ? You want Kronole ? Here . Take it . Open it . Open the gate ! You 're crazy Fucking obsessed with gates Here , have a smoke You should be grateful The world 's last cigarette , You tail section dick You ever been to the Tail Section ? Do you have any idea what went on back there ? When we boarded ? It was chaos . Yea , we didn 't freeze to death but we didn 't even have time to be thankful . Wilford 's soldiers came and took everything . More than a thousand people in an iron box , no food , no water . After a month , we ate the weak . Do you know what I hate about myself ? I know what people taste like . I know that babies taste the best . There was a woman . She was hiding with her baby . Then some men with knives came . They killed her and they took her baby . And then an old man . No relation , just an old man . Stepped forward and he said , " Give me the knife , " And everyone thought he 'd kill the baby himself . But , he took the knife , and he cut off his arm . Then , he said , " Eat this ! If you 're so hungry . Eat , eat this . Just leave the baby . " I 've never seen anything like that . And the men put down their knives . You 've probably guessed who that old man was . That baby was Edgar . And I was the man with the knife . I killed Edgar 's mother . And then one by one , other people in the Tail Section started cutting off their arms and legs offering them . It was like a miracle . And I wanted to . I tried . A month later , Wilford 's soldiers brought those protein blocks . We 've been eating that shit ever since . 18 years I hated Wilford . 18 years I 've waited for this moment . And now I 'm here . Open the gate . Please . Thanks for your story , Curtis But I don 't want to open the gate You know what I really want ? I want to open the gate Not this gate , but that one The gate to the outside world It 's been frozen shut for 18 years You might take it as a wall But it 's a fucking gate Let 's open it and just get the hell out And freeze to death , what are you fucking crazy . What if we don 't ? What if we could survive outside ? Remember the Yekaterina bridge ? When you were being chopped up There 's something I look at every New Year Under the snow is a crashed airplane 10 years ago , I could barely see the tail Now I can see its body and its wings There 's less ice and snow In other words , it 's melting The type of snow that 's about to melt A little push and it all falls down Recently , you know what I saw ? Outside the window , there was ... Never mind I don 't have to tell you this You gotta take it easy on the Kronole . Snorting that flammable shit 's gonna fry your brain . That 's exactly right Kronole is originally ... an industrial waste Highly flammable . When it 's lit , boom ! Simply put , it 's a fucking bomb ! I didn 't stock up on it for years just to get high It 's to blow up this gate Give me the matches ! What the fuck are you doing ? Give it to me Take that off the door . Curtis Everett . I 've been asked to extend a formal invitation from Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner . After you . Curtis ! Is that you ? Curtis , dear boy . Come in ! Let 's take a look at you . You hungry ? You did a man 's work coming all this way . Please sit down . You are the first human-being to have walked the total length of this train . Tail to Engine . Did you know that ? Well done . Bravo . None of your people have ever been here . To the engine . I 've never been to the Tail Section . Why not ? Too dirty for you ? Don 't want to rub against the vermin of the Tail Section ? Do you think my station is without it 's own drawbacks ? It 's noisy . And it 's lonely . Right . Steaks , plenty of room . This whore to bring you anything you want . Curtis , everyone has their own pre-ordained position . And everyone is in their place except you . That 's what people in the best place say to the people in the worst place . There 's not a soul on this train who wouldn 't trade places with you . Would you trade places with me ? Fuck you . Curtis , dear boy , the fact is we are all stuck inside this blasted train . We are all prisoners in this hunk of metal . Medium rare ? And this train is a closed eco-system . We must always strive for balance . The air , the water , the food supply , the population must be always kept in balance . For optimum balance , however , there have been times when more radical solutions were required . When the population needed to be reduced rather drastically . We don 't have time for true natural selection . We would all be hideously overcrowded and starved waiting for that . The next best solution is to have individual units kill off other individual units . From time to time , we had to stir the pot so to speak . The Revolt of the Seven . The Great Curtis Revolution ! The MacGregor Riots . A blockbuster production with a devilishly unpredictable plot ! Who could have predicted your counterattack with the torch in the Yekaterina Tunnel ! Pure genius ! That wasn 't what Gilliam and I had in our plan . What ? Don 't tell me you didn 't know . Gilliam and I. Our plan . Gilliam ? Gilliam . The front and the tail are supposed to work together . He was more than a partner , really . He was my friend . Bullshit . I don 't believe you . Our original agreement was for this insurgency to end at the Yekaterina Tunnel . And all the survivors would go back to the Tail Section to enjoy much more space . You 're a fucking liar . Gilliam would never do that . It all worked out in the end . Your counterattack actually made the insurgency ten times more exciting . Unfortunately , the front suffered more losses than anticipated , and Gilliam had to pay the price . Ironic , isn 't it ? How people dramatically cross that thin barrier between life and death ? Now , there is just one last thing left for us to do . Tally up the numbers . Hello Wilford . It 's me . I 'm at Gilliam 's place . Hold on . Is it still the same number ? Yes , it still stands at 74 percent . OK . Carry on . Wait . Spare 18 to celebrate our 18th year . That 's an excellent idea . Your people . God damn it , Claude . Mind the Engine ! She 's getting sensitive recently . Sit down and mind your table manners . Just relax . Calm down . Boy , now I can see what Gilliam meant , he told me you are brilliant and clever , but always so tense . When 's the last time you got laid ? Like Gilliam said holding a woman is much better with two arms . I 'll miss Gilliam . I 'll miss our late night phone chats . Oh , he could go on for hours , all with only one arm ! What 's with that face ? What 's the matter ? You look like a crazy person . As if there aren 't enough crazies on this train ! Blood ! Are you okay ? What happened ? Get down ! Yona Open that gate and get the Kronole ! See those wires inside ? Shit , tons of ' em ... Kill . You punk ! I believe it is easier for someone to survive on this train if they have some level of insanity . I mean as Gilliam well understood , We need to maintain a proper balance of anxiety and fear chaos and horror in order to keep life going . If we don 't have that , we need to invent it . In that sense , the Great Curtis Revolution you invented was truly a masterpiece . Yona Red goes into 8 No , 7 ! Come with me , Curtis . There is something I want to show you . You deserve it . Come on . She 's waking up now . Cozy , yes ? Peaceful . You are now in her heart . I 've devoted my entire life to this the Eternal Engine . It is eternity itself . Have you ever been alone on this train ? When was the last time you were alone ? You can 't remember , can you ? So please do , take your time . I just wrote it . It 's for you Curtis . Here . I am old . I want you to take my station . It 's what you always wanted . It 's what Gilliam wanted too . You must tend the Engine , keep her humming . Look , Curtis . Beyond that gate . Section after section precisely where they 've always been and where they 'll always be all adding up to what ? The train . And now , the perfectly correct number of human beings all in their proper places all adding up to what ? Humanity . The train is the world , we the humanity . And now you have the sacred responsibility to lead all of humanity . Without you , Curtis , humanity will cease to exist . You 've seen what people do without leadership . They devour one another . Yona , the Kronole ! Yona , stop ! No bullet ? Put the Kronole on the gate Look at them . That 's how people are . You know . You 've seen this . You 've been this . Ridiculous , pathetic , aren 't they ? You can save them from themselves . This is what Gilliam has saved you for . Curtis . This is your destiny . It 's ready ! Curtis has the match ! Curtis ! The match ! The space only allows for a very small person . Young children - under five . The Engine lasts forever but not so all of its parts . That piece of equipment went extinct recently . We needed a replacement . Thank goodness the Tail Section manufactures a steady supply of kids . So we can keep going manually . You fucking bastard ! Yona ! Take the fire ! Only one left ! Andy ? Is that you ? Andy . You remember me ? Andy , stop . Listen to me . Don 't go up those stairs . Listen . Andy ! Come here . Come over here . Andy , Listen to me . Get outta there ! God damn it , Andy , listen to me ! Curtis , don 't be so melodramatic . You know everyone has their own pre-ordained position . Nice . Dad ! Dad ! Daddy ! Curtis . Curtis . Just stay there !

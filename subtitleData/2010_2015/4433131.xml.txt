 SPACE PILOT - The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem Flying my rocket on Monday the 10th of October ... on my way to the Egg Planet , I didn 't want to take anymore detours to finally get some fresh omelet eggs . What 's that ? I wanna fly straight ahead for a change . I have my reservations , Mr. Tichy . It looks murky . I wouldn 't risk flying through it . What ? Give me the map ! One potato ... two tomato ... divided by zero ... Aha , the straight path . Fly through it ! My gut feeling says that it 's safer to make a small detour . You 're a holograph . You can 't have any gut touchy-feely stuff . Apparently I do , I 'm more than a hologram , and my gut says : No ! But my rational mind decides and it says : go . Fly through ! This is how I imagine my home planet . My subconscious drew this ... Are you scatterbrained ? This is the brochure of the Egg Planet . An important document , now you 've smudged it . There 's a special offer on eggs ! " One egg free on your birthday . " They also sing happy birthday . When 's your birthday , Mr. Tichy ? Enough ! Out , both of you . The Fog ... Fog of Clarity ... Marine Fog ... Fogula Cognitionis : " The fog of awareness " . Wow ... What ? - Wow ... You jokester , have you forgotten how to speak ? Mr. Tichy , something ... weird is happening in this fog . Don 't worry . I 've worked out a new course . You think it 's reasonable to set a course based on the colors of the numbers ? You 're questioning my rational mind ? Well , see how you like this , then ! So much for your rational mind and my gut feelings ... THE MEMENTO You 're getting worse and worse ! I thought you wanted to tidy up the rocket ? What 's wrong ? It 's really bad . An existential emergency-crisis . - You don 't say . I ... Ijon Tichy , a genius in logical thinking ... have forgotten a number : the date of my birthday . You don 't say . I know how to find it . One potato , two tomato ... Now , Mr. Tichy ... let 's just relax a little ... Get comfortable ... and space will seem much better . One potato , two tomato ... - Yes , two tomato . I think we 're dealing with a little mental block . We have to , somehow , access your subconsciousness . Subsandwichesmess ? - Yeah . Stop it , Mel ! I can make out a butterfly . What do you see ? A birthday egg ... What else ... It 's all the same to me ... Mel , get the radio . Now we 're going to dance . Come on , join in . It 'll totally relax you . That was your favorite cup . Get a little mad . Let your feelings out . Ok , he 's catatonic . Totally blocked up . Tomorrow 's a new day , you 're sure to remember your birthday then . Good night . It 's me ... Do you think maybe ... I can snooze at your place tonight ? Don 't tell me the Cosmic Hero is afraid of the dark ? No , no , no ... But that cupboard belonged to my granny . It 's a memento . Maybe it will jog my memory , help me remember ... My birthday ... for example . I see , Mr. Tichy , a memento ... But just this once . I had a queasy feeling . I must 've turned on the secret elevator in the cupboard . It led to a secret cellar in my rocket . And was full of old junk . When did I put this stuff down here ? My favorite cup ... And then I realized something . There was a second cupboard ... and there was a strange noise coming from it . I had to see this . Good morning , Mr. Tichy . Time to wake up ! Good morning , Mel . See how uncomfortable it is for me to . You 're totally scrunched up , Mr. Tichy . What 's that ? Some jackass broke my favorite cup . Dammit ! It seems a night in the closet did you good . Your block is gone , anyway . What 's it to you ? - Very good ! Let it all out . It 's good for you and you 'll remember your birthday . Here , go on ! Hey ! Are you sick-headed ? You scrap of crap appliance . I 'll show you what happens when I let out my angry rant-rage ... on you ! And now , out of the rocket , you scrappy appliance . I 've never seen him like that . What do we do when he wakes up ? You 're much heftier than I thought . Go away , sniffle-snout . Back here again ... No way , I 've spent long enough in this dark cellar . It 's my turn to sit up there . - What 's all this old junk ? Out of my way ! I always wanted to do that ! What do we do with him ? Come on , Mel . Help me ! How did this get here ? It 's Mr. Tichy 's favorite cup . The Chronocycle , the broken spare part ... my pretty vase ... Mel , I think this is not junk ... it 's memories . If these really are Mr. Tichy 's memories , then we 'd better get rid of his cup . No broken pieces , no memory ... no problem ! " Dear Santa , I want an egg cup with stars on it . I was a good boy . Your Ijon . " Let 's see where this goes . What 's that ? RANT-RAGE CAGE I didn 't snooze well ... I have a big fat rattle-head . Another one ? - You flabby crybaby . Now I know . You knocked me out , so you could go up ... Buddy-boy , now I 'll even the score . - Come on then . Gentlemen ... Mr. Tichy , I know what 's happening here . Mel ! I don 't get it ? - That 's great . You finally found a way back to your blocked subconscious . Silly crap . It 's a nightmare gone bad ... If so , then what is your suppressed aggression doing here ? Now I understood . I was inside my head . But if that was my ugly angry face , what did he do down here ... while I was sub-pressing my aggressive rant-rage ? Come on , you limp wimp ... No ! I 'll just sub-press the bad anger . That 's what I wanted know ! SUPPRESSED Keep this place nice and clean , got it ? Excellent , you have your aggression under control again . You seem so well balanced now ... Wipe that smile off your face ! Well maybe not so well balanced , after all . Get your grabby paws off me ! I don 't want to go back in the closet ! I 'm sick of this ! Not another head-cellar . Do you at least know the date of our birthday ? Even if I knew , I wouldn 't tell you ! How nice . It 's all stupid-silly ... No one 's here . The only reason we 're down here ... is to find my voice of reason , my rational self , the real me ... and ask him about my birthday . Mr. Tichy , look at how you treat your sensitive side . Don 't cry . He didn 't mean it . Hey , Mel-fellow . This is my subsandwitchesmess ! No sepulking ! Come here , now ! Mr. Tichy is totally underdeveloped , socially . I 've often hidden my tears from him , he can be so mean sometimes . But first tell us why you 're so sad . Because he forgot my birthday . Best day of the year ... Ok , maybe I forgot a little . But maybe you know when our birthday is ? I 'm really sorry ! I 'm sorry too ! How sweet . He 's overcome another mental block . What 's going on here ? Enough ! Is this kindergarten , or what ? Who started this ? Was it you again ? - Kiss my ass ! Who 's up there , cackle-laughing like that ? That 's the voice of reason . The rational mind ? The voice of reason is sneering at us . That 's just great ! Enough ! That 's my ingenious mind . My factual , scientific , real-me self . It knows and controls everything . While we 're down here dancing like jackasses ! I want to meet it now ! And ask about my birthday . It must know ! - Yes , I 'd like to know too ! Mel ? Hey , wait up ! I 'm starting to get all tingly . Move over ! Don 't leave without us ! I 'm cramped tight ! - You 're too belly-fat ! I 'm here too . - Hey , don 't mess up my hair ! How does the elevator work ? We could activate the rational mind with a riddle . Or just close the door ! The rational mind , he 's in there ! I 'm a scaredy-mouse ... You must be Mr. Tichy 's rational mind ? I don 't believe that ! You , little rascal ? Mr. Tichy it 's no wonder you can 't remember your birthday . We can 't ask this little critter . That 's my rational self ? This little creepy-crawly kid ? Mr. Tichy , now we know . Today is your birthday ! Happy Birthday for me ! Happy birthday to us all ... Silly crap ! - Please let this nightmare end ! Hello ? Where are we ? It 's so cramped tight here . I 've no idea . - Wow . It 's so dark in here ! The Mel-fellow can talk again . Look , the fog is gone . And now that we know it is my birthday today ... we can celebrate a fun little party . Was . What ? - It was your birthday , Mr. Tichy . I 'm doggone tired . I 'm going to bed ! I 'll fix the controls and the power cut tomorrow . You keep your fingers off it . Your rational mind shouldn 't have to deal with something this difficult . Nighty-night ! People later said that I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth . But lost all inhibitions on long space voyages . God knows how this rumor got started . An egg cup with stars on it . How did you know ? " Thank-you " would do . How did you know ? - Oh , Mr. Tichy ... Let 's just say ... I had a gut feeling ! People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap than perfectly good facts .

 Previously on " the 100 " ... Where 's finn ? Looking for you . Where is the girl who was wearing this watch ? Their clothes are here . They were here ! Nyko : You slaughtered my people . Elders . Children . Innocents . Lexa : The massacre must be answered . Blood must have blood . Jaha : And as we speak , they are marching on this camp . Clarke : They 're not attacking yet , Which means we still have time . Deliver me the one you call finn . Our truce begins with his death . [ indistinct shouting ] Hold your fire ! She 's back ! Open the gate . Byrne : Power up the gates . Roll-out positions . Stay ready ! You ok ? Clarke : Shut the gate . You can 't be out here . What did she say ? Is there a chance for a truce ? Yes . What 's wrong ? They want you . If we want a truce , We have to give them finn . What the hell are you talking about ? That 's their offer . That 's not an offer . It 's punishment . For what happened at the village . Blood for blood . That 's insane . If we refuse ? They attack . Man : Say we give him up ! Get rid of him . Byrne : Easy , people . Give him to the grounders . Back off ! Hey , raven , raven . Raven , listen to me . Nothing is gonna happen to him . I promise , ok ? Griff : I 'm not dying for him . Spacewalker burned 3 months of oxygen on the ark . He should 've floated a long time ago . Throw him out ! Back off ! Stop , raven ! Raven : Let me go . It 's not the only option . [ crowd shouting ] External airlock pressure tolerances can be adjusted- - At the manual feed stem . Ask me a hard one . You 've answered all of these , like , 10 times . I have to go over this stuff . You 're running fluid dynamic specs While we 're having sex . I think you 've been over it . Multitasking . So , what do you want to do for your birthday ? Honestly ... I just want to pass . That 's it ? Move up to zero-g So i don 't have to spend the rest of my life Trapped inside this tin can ? That 'd be enough . Yeah . Well , i got you something . Made it , actually . Mm . It 's a raven . I thought it might bring you luck . For your test . Do you like it ? Hey , man . Byrne actually gave me a gun . I guess we really are screwed , huh ? Look , we kicked their asses last time . We 'll do it again . A lot of people died last time . Hey . We 're reinforcing all defenses . Doubles on the perimeter . No one 's getting past that wire . I 'll see where they 're thin . No . You should head inside . B corridor will be easier to defend If it comes to that . I 'm not gonna hide . Right now , we have to think about keeping you safe . I 'm gonna talk to lincoln . Come on . Bellamy : Finn . Hey . Any orders for me , princess ? Stay away from me . Just trying to be helpful . You were with him at the village . I tried to stop him . Not hard enough . You know , you want to start blaming people , clarke ? He was out there looking for you . Clarke : Hang on . [ lincoln coughing ] He 's not a reaper anymore . He doesn 't need to be restrained . Yes , i do . Just tell us . Is there a way to make peace ? Did she leave riders behind ? Two just outside the gate . They 're waiting for finn . You don 't have much time to decide . She can 't expect us to just Hand over one of our own people . - Would she do that ? - She wouldn 't let The rest of her people die to protect a murderer . If you don 't do this , she will kill Everyone in this camp . There has to be something else that we can offer . Finn took 18 lives . The commander 's offering to take Just one in return . - Take the deal . - How can you say that ? Finn was the first person to come to you To offer peace . He 's your friend . He massacred my village . Some of the dead were my friends , too . But that wasn 't finn . You know that 's not who he is . It is now . We 've all got a monster inside of us , clarke , And we 're all responsible for what it does When we let it out . What will they do to him ? Fire . Because he killed the innocent , It starts with fire . Starts ? They 'll take his hands . His tongue , his eyes . And anyone who grieves will have a turn with the knife . At sunrise , the commander will end it with her sword . But i 've never known anyone to survive until the sword . He killed 18 , he will suffer the pain of 18 deaths . Then we can have peace . Abby . Let me out of here , please . It was stupid . I 'm sorry . I don 't want to hear it . He was ready to throw finn out the gate . And you think i would let that happen ? I don 't know . No . The only way we 're gonna make it through this Is if we trust each other . I 'm trying . She 's free to go . If you do anything like that again , You will be back here and you will stay here . Do you understand me ? Don 't be too hard on her . She 's a fighter . We need fighters . We need to find a way out of this Without fighting . There is a way , and you know what it is . No . It 's not an option . We need to consider it . I said no . I am not sending A child to his death . We sent 100 of them to the ground . That was another time and another chancellor . Finn ? Bellamy told me you were here . What are you doing ? I have to go . Where ? There 's nowhere to go . I 'm putting everyone in this camp in danger . There are grounders everywhere , finn . They 'll kill you . Maybe that 's what i deserve . For what i 've done . You were trying to find our people . Trying to save us . I was trying to save you . Clarke ... - Finn-- - i 'm in love with you . Everything that 's happened , Everything i 've done . All that matters is that you 're ok . That you forgive me . Say something . Don 't leave . Please . [ indistinct chanting outside ] What is that ? Clarke : This is it . We have to get you inside . [ grounders continue chanting ] They 're trying to scare us . I think we should pull back And go inside the station . No . We need to prove we 're not afraid . What if i am ? Fake it . Open the gate . Where 's the boy ? We 're not giving him up . We 're ready to fight , If that 's what it comes to . Huh , hyah , hyah ! Watch the woods ! Watch for movement ! Bellamy . Man : Movement on the tree line ! Don 't shoot ! Don 't shoot ! Marcus . Chancellor . I was afraid that i wouldn 't see you again . I had those fears myself . It 's good to see this place again . Can 't be out in the open . We need to get somewhere safe . It 's safe for the moment . Come on . We need to talk . I managed to buy us a bit of time . Man : All right , close it up ! Let 's go ! Where did they keep you ? Uh , the commander 's stronghold , i think . I wasn 't a prisoner , but I wasn 't allowed outside , either . Until they brought me up here last night With a bag over my head . What is this ? What 's going on ? Apparently , the chancellor thinks I 'm a very dangerous man . Wait outside . Guard : Yes , ma 'am . Abby : The former chancellor Is being detained for treason . No offense , marcus , but i 'm keeping the job Until this is over . I would advise you not to fight her on this . Abby : You bought us time how ? I 've gotten to know the commander And i believe ... She 'd be open to the right proposal . What kind of proposal ? We offer to put the boy on trial ourselves . Here . For war crimes . War crimes ? Abby , if we put him on trial , At least we will have control over the process And his treatment . So , instead of letting the grounders kill finn , We would execute him ourselves ? That 's a strong possibility . Abby , i know this is hard . But given what we know , Given the ferocity of grounder justice , This could be the most merciful Outcome for the boy . You still want the job ? What 's happening ? Bellamy : You were in there a long time . There was a lot to talk about . Well , what 's going on ? There was a lot to talk about . Hey . We are not turning him over to the grounders . Step aside now . We 're all trying to find a way out of this . They 're gonna give him up . Man on p.A. : All fighters being deployed , move to section 5 . All fighters being deployed , move to section 5 . Hey . What 's up ? Happy birthday . Yeah . Sorry about that . I know we had a plan . The team got jammed up . Maybe i 'll see you later ? Did they post the scores ? Aced it . The first perfect score Since they 've been giving the test . So , when 's your first spacewalk ? That 'd be never . What ? I failed the physical . Some kind of heart murmur . It 's like a trillion to one i 'd ever feel it , But they don 't want to waste the training on me In case i might kick it , so ... I 'm out . Happy birthday . Bellamy : Finn . You need to get out of here . Where would he go ? The dropship . No ! You know that this is the safest place for him right now . It isn 't if they 're turning on him . We can protect him at the dropship Until we figure this thing out . Grab your gear and meet at raven 's gate in 5 . She 's already working on cutting The power to the fence . Ok , but nobody 's coming with me . That isn 't up for discussion . We are surrounded by grounders . If we split up , we take the low ground , We 'll make it through . We 'll meet at the dropship . Man : There he is . You are gonna get us killed . [ clattering ] Bellamy : Anyone else ? Bellamy 's right . We have to go . I thought we were meeting in the mess . I thought this would be better On an empty stomach . Happy birthday . Uh , you 're a week and a half late , And you 've already given me something . Open it . Do you like it ? It 's a piece of tape with my name on it . It goes with this . I borrowed it from the maintenance bay . There 's external repairs scheduled all month . The crew knocked off at 6 And no one in monitoring will be Paying attention to an open airlock In that section . No one will ever know . So , you want to go for a walk ? Decom sequence complete . Is that everything ? Purge recycle tanks . Uh , open the refresh valve . [ beeping ] Finn : Ok . Done . Here we go . Have fun . The commander accepted this agreement ? We haven 't made the proposal yet . But i think she 'll be willing to consider it . I need to know . If we put finn on trial ourselves , Is your commander going to accept the outcome , Even if we decide he belongs in jail ? Even if she wanted to accept this deal , She 'd be dead by morning . She 'd know that . Your people would kill their own leader For being merciful ? For being weak . Finn killed innocent people . If death has no cost , life has no worth . That 's how we live . I spent time with your commander . She 's a visionary . And that 's why you 're all still alive . If it were up to some at her table , you wouldn 't be . - Indra ? - She leads those voices , yes . She 's dangerous , abby . Abby : If she 's the one that 's standing In the way of an agreement , I need to speak to her face to face . There 's nothing you can say . Maybe not . But i can show her We understand her pain . Maybe that will be enough . Hey . You see anything ? I thought we were splitting up . Not a chance . What do we do after the dropship ? Where do we go ? You think the grounders will just leave When they find out i 'm gone ? Is this the best way to help Our friends inside mount weather ? We will figure this out . Rawr ! Finn : Look out ! I don 't want to shoot you . Go ! Get out of here ! [ no audio ] I checked again . Still no sign of them . Where are they ? We shouldn 't have split up . Someone 's coming . Ooh , hey , hey , hey . Murphy . What are you doing here ? I believe i was invited . I thought we could use an extra gun . Might be a good idea . Raven : Finn should 've been right behind you . Don 't worry . The spacewalker 's gonna be fine . [ static on radio ] finn : This is ark station calling birthday girl . You 're hitting eva max . Time to come back inside . Are you reading , birthday girl ? Received , ark station . On my way . Closing the outer doors . [ doors closing ] Ahh . How was that ? Free . [ bang ] [ alarm blaring ] Woman on p.A. : Warning . Outer door breached . Airlock pressure failing . Initiate emergency protocol . What happened ? Finn ? I don 't know ! What happened ? A grounder hit her on the head . Put her here . I need a bandage . A rag . Anything . Got it . Here . Hold her head . Bellamy : Clarke , can you hear me ? Bellamy : Clarke . Bellamy : You 're gonna be fine . You just need to rest . Hey . It 's just a bump on the head . Clarke 's gonna be ok . Are you ? We 'll figure this out . That 's what she said . Right before i almost got her killed . Why have you come , Leader of the sky people ? To talk . Leader to leader . We 've both seen too many of our people die . No . You came to lie . We have seen your killer in the forest . You ordered him to run , And then you came here to distract us . I 'm just trying to keep my people alive . Same as you . You told our riders you were ready to fight . If we don 't find the boy soon , You 'll get to prove that . You kill one of ours , we kill two of yours . That only helps the mountain men . There has to be a way to end this without bloodshed . You have courage ... But courage isn 't justice . Only the boy can die for what the boy has done . Still nothing ? Just give her a little time . I never meant to hurt you . I know . Truth is , things change . Maybe that 's for the best . Don 't let me off the hook so easy . [ chuckles ] We 'll always be family . Always . [ groans ] Raven : Hey . Told you she 'd be ok . Ahh . How 's your head ? Awesome . When you went down ... I thought you were dead . Because of me . I 'm right here . I 've killed so many people . Finn , the things that we 've done to survive ... They don 't define us . What if you 're wrong ? What if this is who we are now ? Bellamy : We got company ! Get out here . Bellamy : Get down . Grounders . We 're surrounded . [ alarm blaring ] Woman on p.A. : Airlock pressure . Approaching red zone . I can 't open the inner door ! We must 've blown a seal . The doors won 't open until we 're equalized ! Woman on p.A. : Airlock pressure now critical . - The door ! - Raven ! Raven : Manual override . Woman on p.A. : Emergency override authorized . Unh . Shut the door . [ coughing ] Are you ok ? [ breathing heavily ] Woman on p.A. : Emergency support teams To airlock b-17 immediately . We gotta get out of here . It was a breach . The section doors are sealed . Take off the suit . Take it off and give it to me . Finn , finn , that breach lost a lot of oxygen . That plus an unauthorized spacewalk , It 's a capital crime . I 'm still 17 . I 'll go to the skybox for a couple months , Then i 'll get a review . - Review ? - I 'll have a chance . A good one . Raven , you 're 18 . You 'll get floated . Take off the suit . Now ! Man : There he is . Am i gonna get in trouble for this ? They 're not moving any closer . Staying out of range . Probably waiting until it 's dark . If we hit them now , at least we 'd take them by surprise . We don 't even know how many of them are out there . I 'm not hearing any better ideas , clarke . We 'll give them something . All they want is finn . Finn wasn 't the only one at the village . What are you talking about ? Raven , hold on . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Raven , i came here to protect him . You were the one who wanted me to come . You- - That 's why you asked me to come along . Enough grounders saw him at the village . They 'd believe he was the shooter . Sick bitch . Raven , you don 't mean this . You know what they do to people . They want a murderer , we 'll give them one . [ cocks gun ] drop your gun . Go to hell , raven . Put it down , raven . Like it or not , he 's one of us . I said drop it . Stop ! Stop ! Finn : We 're not doing this . They 've got us surrounded . The only thing we can do is stay . And defend this place . I 'm with you . - Murphy ... - Yeah . Go upstairs . Watch the rear . I 'll take the lower level . You three , take the front gate . That 's the plan . All right ? Hey . We got this . May we meet again . We will . Yeah . Be careful . You , too . See anything ? No . Raven : Someone 's coming . Raven : There . Clarke : Finn ? No . Finn ! Sinclair : Reyes ! Yes , sir . How 's that supply line coming ? It 's a piece of crap . Sir . But i 'll get it working . No , you won 't . I 'm pulling you off duty . You got your zero-g certification . Congratulations . But i failed the physical . Yeah , i saw your test scores . I overruled the rejection . You 're in . Now , get moving . [ door opens and closes ] What is that ? It 's for finn . They want us to watch . We 're gonna get him . We 'll get in close and we 'll hit them hard . Kane : Son ... There 's thousands of them . Even if we could kill hundreds , They 'd still wipe out this camp And your friend would still die . We have to try . Abby . Raven : Abby , we have to do something . No , raven . Take this . What are you doing ? I 'm gonna talk to the commander . What else do you have to say ? I don 't know . I don 't know . - Clarke . - Give me your hand . If she won 't let him go , kill her . Things 'll go crazy , and we 'll grab you and finn . Clarke . You have to help him . I owe him my life . [ indistinct shouting ] Clarke . What is she doing ? Wait . Abby . Gotta let her try . Raven : What is she doing ? I 'm here to talk to your commander . Let me through . Lexa : Let her pass . You bleed for nothing . You cannot stop this . No . Only you can . [ grounders shouting indistinctly ] Show my people how powerful you are . Show them you can be merciful . Show them you 're not a savage . We are what we are . Then i 'm a killer . I burned 300 of your people . I slit a man 's throat and watched him die . I 'm soaked in grounder blood . Take me . But finn is guilty . No . He did it for me . He did it for me . Then he dies for you . Raven : Come on , clarke . Do it . Can i say good-bye ? Raven : What is she doing ? I love you , too . I 'm scared . [ groans ] You 're gonna be ok . [ crying ] You 're ok . Thanks , princess . [ crying ] [ grounders shouting indistinctly ] lexa : It is done . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! [ crying ]

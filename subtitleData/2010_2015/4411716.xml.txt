 You want to destroy the Book Of Pure Evil ? ! No offense , Mr. Kolinsky , but you 've been in a semi-coma for the past year and take it from us , the Book is bad news . Yeah . It 's like a wild mistress . It can 't be tamed . It 's true . Todd almost became the Pure Evil One , Curtis ' demonic arm almost killed Todd , and the homunculus almost killed Jenny . I think what the Gang is trying to say , dad , is the Book has to be destroyed , it 's evil ... I 've devoted my life to this thing ! The Book is just one part of the Prophecy . Why don 't you just tell us what the Prophecy is ? The Prophecy is ... so complex that your immature minds couldn 't possibly understand it ! Now , as the only adult in this Gang ... Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... Who said that you 're in the Gang ? I say I am ! You all need me . You , Todd , especially . I 'm the only one that can help with this Pure Evil One business . You know what ? I don 't need anyone . Know why ? 'Cause I 'm my own dude . Hold on , maybe my Dad ... Jennifer , what did I teach you about not interrupting ? ! Don 't call me Jennifer ! Nobody calls me that ! Jennifer ... Jenny is short for Jennifer ? Hannah , you 're an intelligent , strong young woman . Talk some sense into them , sweetcheeks . I respect your credentials , Mr. Kolinsky , but it seems your perspective on the Book runs opposite to ours . And I 'm uncomfortable with you calling me sweetcheeks . Dude ! That 's my girlfriend ! Not cool ! No offense , but you 're kind of super old . Hey , my Dad 's not that old ! Uh , yeah he is . Look at how high he wears his pants . AND he 's got a cane . The last thing this Gang needs is a cripple . Not to mention , he 's always going on about buffets . Hey ! Buffet is a respectable amount of food for a reasonable price . If you kids can 't even understand that , then there 's no hope for you ! You don 't want me in your Gang ? FINE ! You 'll regret this , you idiots ! Dad , wait ! Douche ! Excuse me . Ugh ! Ugh ! God damn kidney stones ... Destroy the Book ? Those idiots ! If only I could find a way to convince them otherwise ... Ugh ... Psst ... Hey , Grandpa . My friends and I are trying to have a romantic moment here . Could you masturbate somewhere else ? Thanks , man . Planto mihi ... tener virile ... quod connubialis ... iterum ! Bye ! Oh , that 's right . I 'm cool . Oh yes , you are . Todd The Book Of Pure Evil S02E03 " Daddy Tissues " By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es = = SPREAD THE WORD = = Do you guys think , that , like , maybe we were too hard on my Dad ? Are you kidding ? No offense , Jenny , but your Dad 's kind of an asshole . I gotta go with Todd on this one . I have to concur , Jenny . I think he has very questionable intentions . You guys don 't know him like I know him . He yelled at you . He doesn 't listen to anything you say . He called you a name you hate . But that 's what all Dads do , guys ! Hey Gang . What 's shaking ? Uh , who are you ? Rufus Newman . You 're a dogtwat . What 'd I ever do to you ? Yesterday you asked Hannah and I to have a three-way with you in the bathroom ! Dude ! That 's my girlfriend ! Not cool ! So not cool ! You stay away from our women , dude ! Shit ! Mmmm ! Mmmhhmmm ! Listen up ... If I 'm going to become the Pure Evil One , I need to know more about this Prophecy . So , let me guess , none of you know anything about the Prophecy ? Your father did . But he 's ... Dead . Yes . Very helpful . The reporter . Pat Kolinsky . He knows about the Prophecy . That 's why we kidnapped him . Good , now we 're getting somewhere . Unfortunately we thought we used truth serum on him but it was actually rat poison and he fell into a semi-coma . Why do we keep them on the same shelf ? We have to re-kidnap Pat Kolinsky . " We , " meaning " I. " Because you useless farts can 't do anything and I have to do everything by myself . Stupid geezers ! He likes to nap a lot in the afternoons ... 'Cause he 's old ... He 's not old ... He 's old ! Look how high he wears his pants . Hey , Gang . What 's shaken ? Who are you ? Warren Chopra ! How dare you show your face , after what you did ! What did I do ? Don 't act like you don 't remember ! Grade 9 ! Science Fair ! I was on the cusp of creating a new form of bacterial life ! And you sabotaged it ! Did I ? Dude ! That 's my girlfriend ! Not cool ! Yeah ! So not cool ! You stay away from our women , dude . Whoa , Hannah . You 're really angry . Warren Chopra brings out the worst in me . This isn 't gonna be as easy as I thought . Re-Elect Devon for Student Council President ! Hey , guys ! Who are you ? Devon Morrow ! You 're that guy ! I hope I can count on your support on election day . Especially you , Jenny . Oh , Devon ! Vote for Devon ! Time to be impeached , Mr. President ! By impeached , I mean ... SKINNED ! Hi , Daddy ! Where are you ? It 's Jenny . Your daughter . Usually it takes calling my dad six or seven times before he calls me back . It 's no big deal . Maybe he 's ignoring you . 'Cause he 's a giant douche . You 're talking about the guy who took me out for ice cream when I was little . Even though I 'm lactose intolerant . What do you want , dickbag ? Dickbag ... Tell me , do you just take random obscenities and pair them up with equally random nouns ? " Cock Lamp " ... " Ass Taxi " ... " Shit Rooster " . Is that the way it works ? Pffft , no , we can do way better than that . Note to self . Call somebody a " Shit Rooster " . What do you want anyway , Atticus ? I want to know where your father is . And you 're going to tell me . Stay the hell away from my Dad ! If you don 't tell me where he is I 'll have you all expelled . And then I 'll have you institutionalized . Mr. Murphy ... I couldn 't help but overhearing you threatening these fine students for no good reason . Go away , Devon ... You realize that as student council president , I have lunch with the Principal twice a week . Yeah , so do I ... Twice a year . I 'm sure he 'd love to hear all about your questionable guidance counselling behavior . Well , I never did that . Whatever it is you 're implying . Who do you think the Principal 's going to believe ? His sniveling weasel of a guidance counsellor or me , a young , dynamic , attractive student president ? Wow . Well said , Devon . No wonder you 're school president . Guys , we have to find my dad before Atticus does . Don 't worry , Jenny . We 'll find him . " We ? " First , I 'd just like to say I 'm a big fan of you guys and the good work you 're doing at this school . We don 't know what you 're talking about . Sure you don 't . Sweetcheeks ... You think I haven 't noticed that whenever something not dope goes on around here , you guys are in the middle of it ? I think it 's cool ! Cool like how I wear my pants so low , see ? Dude , you can almost see his dick . I know . Cool . I think with Student Council President on your side , fighting the forces of evil could get a hell of a lot easier . Even if we did have a gang that fights evil , which we don 't , what makes you think we 're looking for a new member ? Hmmm ... that 's an excellent point , Todd . Has anyone ever told you you have great leadership qualities ? Yeah , that 's what I 'm telling these people all the time ! I could really use someone like you as my running mate in the next election . You and I , we could do some great things together , Todd . Think about it . Thanks , dude ! No ... Thank you . For being you . Well ... Guess I 'll see you guys around . Hey , Devon , hold on ! Gang huddle . Ok , this Devon dude seems pretty cool . I agree , have you seen his pants ? He really put Atticus in his place . You won 't hear any argument from me . Devon ! Welcome to the Gang , dude . Thank you ! You won 't regret it . Ok , let 's get down to business ! We have to find Jenny 's dad before Atticus does . Jenny ? Wherever he is , I 'm sure your Dad 's okay . Now everybody ... I know a great place we can go to talk strategy . They have a great buffet . YES ! I love buffet ! It 's a pretty simple CCTV operation . Power on , power off . That sort of thing . CCTV ? Now I can watch the whole school and nothing will be hidden from me . Whoa , whoa ... You cannot do that ! Look , I could get in a lot of trouble . I swore an oath only to use my audio-visual knowledge for good . You should have thought of that before you started planting cameras all over the school . You told me to do that ! I 'd like to be alone now , Reggie . With me it 's the opposite . I actually spend too much time ... Would you please just leave ? Stupid nerds ! Devon 's a pretty awesome addition to the Gang . And he says I could be Vice President someday ! Also , he knows where all the good early-bird buffets are . And is this Devon kid popular ? Yeah . Handsome ? Arguably . Is he a pussy magnet ? Uh ... Yeah , I guess so . And none of this worries you ? Alright , you already have two dudes in the gang and two girls in the gang you want to add another dude ? Uh , I don 't know if I 'm following you . Look , dude , you don 't really know this guy . So , he could potentially be a cock blocker between you and Jenny . Wow ... Yeah , I never thought about it that way before . That 's why you come to me . GASP ! Sorry , sweetcheeks . Didn 't mean to scare you . Oh , um , that 's okay , Devon . Hi , Devon . I 'm pretty bummed out right now and I could really use a shoulder to cry on . Maybe a little bit of buffet . Did I just hear my new favourite word ? Jenny . You . Me . Buffet . I know a place that even Devon doesn 't know about . Ahhhhhhhh ! A scream ! I think it came from the boy 's washroom ! Let 's go ! You sure it didn 't come from the cafeteria ? Or the science lab ? Or something other than the boys washroom ? Ahhhhhhhh ! We heard a girl scream . Uh , that was me . You get used to it . Ahhhhhh ! Is one of those bodies my dad ? Man , I thought we were gonna have a book-free day for once . Where 's the volume on this thing ? Stupid nerds ! " Curtis . Why . You . That . My ... Kark ? " What the hell is a kark ? No , the hero 's name was Kark . No , Kark was the alien , remember ? Kark peeled off the hero 's skin and ate it . One of these bodies could be my dad and you 're talking about some stupid movie ? ! Yeah , how could you be so insensitive , Curtis ? Dude ! Don 't worry , Jenny . We 'll find out who skinned your Dad . And we 'll skin him right back . Where 's Devon ? He 'll know what to do . Devon with all his pretty boy answers . Devon has some good ideas and you , as always , feel threatened . What do we really even know about Devon ? Other than the fact that he 's totally all over Hannah ? Is he ? Hannah and me . But mostly Hannah . What 's shaking , Gang ? I 'm making molds we can check against school dental records to find out who these bodies are . The school keeps dental records ? Yeah , of course . With all the unidentifiable corpses turning up it just saves time . Dude , your head is bleeding . Oh ... are you ok ? Oh , you know how the scalp bleeds ! Excuse me one moment . CLICK Ugh ! CLICK Ugh ! Hey , what were you doing back th ... Who wants a coffee ? ! Todd , you 're on it . But I don 't even drink coffee . Ok , we 'll put it to a vote . Who wants Todd to get the coffee ? You gotta respect democracy , Todd . And go to the good place , Ahab 's Espresso . All done . Curtis , let 's check these against the school records . Okay ... Oh , Devon ... I 'm so glad you 're here right now . My life is just so out of control ... I mean , everything with the Book , and my Dad disappearing ... Again ... I don 't know how , but I feel like I 've known you my whole life . You 're into me and I think I 'm totally into you too ... I 'm not who you think I am ... How many times did I catch you staring at my boobs ? Once and I was drunk ! Devon ... AHHHHHHHHHH ! Hey sweetie . AHHHHHHHH ! Please , Jennifer , calm down ! I just need to explain ! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH ! CLUNK ! Sorry sweetie ! We just have to go somewhere and have a private conversation ! And Bing-o was his name-o . Oh , how the mighty have fallen ! Looks like somebody 's been demoted to coffee bitch . So I got the Gang some espressos , big deal . It 's called being a good leader . It 's called being a good loser ... Loser . Where 's the donuts ? You don 't eat donuts with espresso , douche . That 's why I got biscotti . Biscotti ! Weapon ! Weapon ! UH ! Watch out , ass taxi . Heeeey , sweetie . How you doing ? Devon ? No ... No , it 's me . Pat . Your Dad . Oh my God , I kissed my father ! In some cultures that 's perfectly acceptable . Why are we on a catwalk ? You love heights ! I hate heights ! I knew it was one or the other . Why did you use the Book , Dad ? You know what it can do ! I couldn 't help myself ! I had to use it in order to get in the Gang ! To control the Book , I need Todd , the Pure Evil One . He will unlock the secret of the Prophecy . And then we can have everything we ever wanted ! Oh no ... You 've gone insane . Is it insane to want the best for your family ? To provide for and protect the ones you love ? I know what 's best for you . Help your dear old daddy , Jennifer , and then I 'll take you out for some ice cream ... Don 't ... call me Jenny ! And I 'm lactose intolerant ! Todd ! Where have you guys been ? One of the skinless corpses is Devon ! Which means Devon isn 't really Devon . Who 's a what 's a ? This coffee 's cold ... Jenny 's in danger ! We have to find her ! What 's with Atticus ? Hey , former Gang members ... Is that a mug in a sock ? Yeah . SPLASH ! Why did you do that , It 's not even hot . You don 't deserve hot coffee , dude . Tell us what you know ! SPLASH ! Stop throwing coffee in my face . SPLASH ! That one was hot . I 'm gonna keep throwing coffee in your face until you tell us what 's going on ! Pat Kolinsky 's the body skinner , he 's taken Jenny to the boiler room . SPLASH ! I told you everything ! That 's just for being a Shit Rooster . Stay away from me ! Join me ... We will lure the Pure Evil One into our fold . I 'll never join you , and neither will Todd ! He may be stupid , but he 's not as stupid as you think ! Maybe ... a certain girl could seduce him into her welcoming arms ... I 've seen the way he looks at you . You 'd pimp out your own daughter ? I prefer the way I just said it . Forget it ! Then I have no choice but to wear your skin and seduce Todd myself ! Sometimes Daddies just don 't want to be Daddies anymore ! The Gang was right about you . I built you up to be my hero , but you 're just an evil asshole ! I can 't believe I spent a year of my life trying to find you ! Hang on , Jenny ! Ow ! Let it go , Dad ! I almost got it ! You may be an evil asshole , but you 're still my Dad . Jennifer ... Jen-ny ! The Prophecy ... Ask not the innkeeper ... For destiny is thy name ... What does that mean ? AHHHHHHH ! UGH ! Well , that was a complete waste of my time . Hey , Jenny . You okay ? I 've had better days . I 'm really sorry about your Dad . I feel like it 's kinda my fault . If I had just let him into the Gang , he wouldn 't have gone all book crazy . No ... My Dad was determined to get the Book no matter what . I mean , his whole life , his whole career ... that Book mattered more to him than I ever did . I just never knew it . But you know what ? It 's time to move on . And to stop falling for guys who are ... Your Dad in skin disguise ? That 's one way of putting it . I guess we 'll never find out what your Dad knew about the Book and the Prophecy . My Dad said something ... before he died . " Ask not the innkeeper . For destiny is thy name . " But who 's the innkeeper ? And what are we not supposed to ask ? Well , at least we know something about the Prophecy that Atticus doesn 't . Well ? Just write it down . By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es = = SPREAD THE WORD = =

 STAHMA : Previously on Defiance ... I 'm sorry , but effective immediately , you 're out of the adreno business . What would you like us to do with our existing adreno stock ? Have it brought to my office . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) Something happened to you the night that you disappeared . What was it ? Talk to me , kiddo . I saw you falling into , I don 't even understand what . Sounds like post-traumatic stress disorder . That 's it ? You got nothing else to say to me ? I 've done terrible things . TOMMY : What terrible things ? TOMMY : Did you tell Nolan ? No ! It could hurt him . You have to trust somebody . Dashinka . Irzu 's path flows through us both . You must follow me . Look , I 've told you everything that I know . You haven 't told me about the safe hidden in your office . I don 't recall a safe . Right hand . Hey . Think of something nice . CHURCHILL : Like Christmas . DOC : No . No ! ( SCREAMING ) You tried to kill my mother . ( SIZZLING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( VOMITING ) WOMAN : ( ON RADIO ) Hey , Defiance . This is Treasure Doll , bringing you the latest hotshtako from Tarr Traxx . Now , you can say you heard it somewhere else , but we all know I 'm the only one who has what you need . ( CASTITHAN SONG PLAYING ) ( LAUGHING ) Oh . ( SIGHING ) I love this job . Thank you . Beats the hell outta turning tricks at the NeedWant . Huh ? I said thanks for the job . ( GRUNTING ) ( MOANING ) Oh , this song . It gets me so hot . You wanna help me out with that , hmm ? Have a little fun ? I have a wife ... Who I 'm about to meet for a family dinner , so if you 'll excuse me ... Let me give you something to think about when you 're with her later . I 'm not my father . ( SIGHING ) That 's too bad . Your father 's one of my favorite customers . ( SIGHING ) He treated me rough . Can you be rough with me ? ( GASPING ) ( MOANING ) Oh . That 's it . Give me a taste of what you did to Skevur . ( GRUNTING ) I ... I didn 't do anything to Skevur ! Of course you did . The word 's out . It 's okay . It 's okay . I think it 's a turn-on . I 'm not like the other girls . ( GRUNTING ) Look , whatever you heard is wrong . If you just shut up and play the records I tell you to play , this can be a nice little side-gig for you . But if you stir up trouble , if you get in my way , I swear I will drop your skinny ass off the top of this arch ! ( MOANING ) You 're hurting me , Alak . ( DOOR OPENING AND SLAMMING ) Well , how long are you gonna be ? They have to replace the tire . Two hours . BERTIE : Now don 't forget to add salt . RAFE : Yeah , I did that . How much ? Dad , stop . Stop , stop , stop , stop . ( DOORBELL RINGING ) Okay . That 's them ! Oh , great . Ack . The in-laws are here and I 'm stuck here cooking a snod . RAFE : And I don 't even know what a snod is . RAFE : You 're killing me , Bertie . ( SNIFFING ) ( SNIFFING ) ( LAUGHING ) Congratulations , Christie . Seriously ? You can smell it ? What 's she talking about ? RAFE : Hold on , Bertie . ( LAUGHING ) RAFE : Is everything all right ? I don 't believe this . Is that ... ( SNIFFING ) Well , are you ... I was gonna tell you in private so that we could announce it at dinner together . ( SIGHING ) BERTIE : Rafe , what ... What 's going on ? ( GASPING ) I 'm gonna be a grandpa ! ( RAFE LAUGHING ON PHONE ) Yes ! RAFE : Did you hear that , Bertie ? Yes ! RAFE : Hurry back . I 'm coming , I 'm coming ! Whoo-hoo ! Oh , baby . I 'm just gonna ... Let 's see . I 'm gonna be the great nanna or auntie or grandma or whatever you wanna call me . BERTIE : It 's gonna be amazing . BERTIE : We 're having a child . VENDER : I don 't care ! ( PANTING ) IRZU : Why did you stop ? We made a deal . Now follow her . ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) No , I won 't . ( LAUGHING ) ( GRUNTING AND PANTING ) Oh . ( CROWD MURMURING ) No . Bertie . Oh God , no . ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( DOC SIGHING ) DATAK : How 's the finger ? It feels like someone cut it off . For the pain . Where 'd you get this ? One of my few remaining connections . You sound concerned . None of my crew have visited . ( GRUNTING ) Well , the visitor policy is ... My wife is smart enough to circumvent any policy . She says she 's working hard to free me . Lobbying the Votanis Collective , parleying with the new mayor . But ? I saw Pottinger 's face when he sat across the table . He was laughing at me with his eyes . He knew something about the situation that I did not . I briefly considered the possibility that somehow you had betrayed me to him . Oh ? But that rang hollow . You 're a pal . So you think that Stahma ... She wouldn 't dare . No . She wouldn 't . RAFE : Ah , it feels good to have the family together . Your mother had a pretty close call with that shrill bomb last week . Yeah . RAFE : You know , I 've been hearing some whispers about this Castithan guy , named Skevur , is it ? You wouldn 't know anything about this Skevur looking for some payback , would you ? A drug thing maybe ? Just gossip . Because you 're a father now . And you have responsibilities . I know . Shortly after your wedding , I had some of my miners kick your ass . You remember that and what I said ? Yeah . I do . Good . 'Cause I will do whatever is necessary to protect Christie and my grandchild from your family 's gangster crap . Now I don 't know how deep you 're involved . And I don 't care . All I care is that it stops . Today . Now . This is your final warning on the subject . ( CIGAR CUTTER SLICING ) Congratulations , Dad . ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING AND BEEPING ) RAFE : And the sensei says , " Not with an elephant , I can 't . " ( LAUGHING ) Anyway , here 's to my new grandson . ALL : Here , here . RAFE : Hey , Nolan . Pull up a stump . We 're celebrating here . Rain check . You haven 't seen Irisa around , have you ? She didn 't show up for her shift . I 'm starting to get worried . Ah , Irisa 's a kid . She 's just probably off doing teenage girl things . ( LAUGHING ) ( IRISA GRUNTING ) It 's 7 : 00 in the morning . Where have you been all night ? I deserve an answer . Now , I 've tried to give you your space . But I 'm a bit sick of tiptoeing around this . I want a straight answer . I 'm not gonna talk to you about this . If you can 't deal with it , you should leave . You know , you wanna be careful about these threats . I might just call your bluff . You 're a tracker . I know you can find the door . Nolan , it 's Bertie . She 's missing . RAFE : She called to say she was stuck in town with a flat , but then she never came home . ( NOLAN SIGHING ) RAFE : She 's never been away all night . Mr. McCawley hailed me , we went searching . I found the roller . There 's no sign of her . All right , all right . Let 's just ask you a few questions . Shouldn 't we be putting together a search party ? NOLAN : First things first . Can anybody think of anybody who may wish Bertie harm ? No , Bertie doesn 't have an enemy in the world . No . But I do . POTTINGER : I have no idea who she is . Never met her . Well there 's no secret there 's bad blood between you and Rafe McCawley . If I have problem with Rafe McCawley , I 'll deal with him myself . And I 'm not in the habit of abducting servants . Awesome . Then you won 't mind me taking a look at your surveillance equipment ? Be my guest . Data room 's downstairs . But send the Irathient . Let 's you and I go for a stroll . Go . ( DOOR OPENING ) Sorry about roughing you up the other day . How are those bruises healing ? Look , I don 't know what happened between you and Tommy . He doesn 't really talk about it that much . But , um , I feel for you . Tommy 's a great guy and it must 've been hard to lose him . And I 'm sorry . Are you gonna say anything ? What do you want me to say ? ( SIGHING ) I like to come down and feel the pulse of the town as often as I can . Take a stroll through the market . POTTINGER : See what 's cooking in the Hollows . Have a nip at the NeedWant . I 've seen you there with Amanda . You seem very close . NOLAN : Well , I 'd be reclining on a beach in Antarctica if it weren 't for her . Oh ? Last year , she convinced me to put on the badge . And she convinced me to convince you to put it back on . Whole lotta convincing going on . I 'm a direct man . I fancy Amanda . I just wanted to make sure you didn 't have a problem with that . You know , I was pretty young when I enlisted . Never got a chance to experience high school . But this conversation right here , this is how I imagined it . BERLIN : Okay . We 're at the marketplace . Looks like your missing Liberata . Let 's see if we can go a little bit closer . Yep . That 's her . She 's on the phone . Looks like she got some good news . Jumping around . Very happy . Going out of range . Walking up Carter Street . Gonna pick her up on camera 6 . Rounding onto Urdu ... ( GASPING ) What the chup ? DATAK : Alak , I didn 't know to expect you . I know that you 're counting on me to step up and be the head of the family . And I 've tried . I really have . Alak , what is this about ? Dad , everything 's changed . Christie 's pregnant . Well , that is good news . Well , I , uh ... It ... it ... it 's got me thinking where exactly my place is in all of this . You know , what 's the best thing to do for Christie and the baby . ( SIGHING ) The truth is , I 've done things . Things I 'm not proud of . And I just , I don 't want to end up ... Like your father . I didn 't say that . My record business is doing really well . I just want your blessing to take a step back ... Out of the question . There must be a Tarr at the head of the table . Profits are up . Way up . Under Raiga and Giemo . Yeah . They can totally handle it without me . Well , no doubt , no doubt . DATAK : One thing troubles me . Raiga and Giemo are good workers , but they lack the brains , the leadership , the JON-du-ra to raise profits . Not without guidance . If they 're not getting it from you , then who 's the one whispering in their ears ? Hmm ? Your mother , perhaps ? ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Do not lie to me , Alak . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) We 're not on Casti anymore , Dad . This is a different world . Tell me something . My men , they , uh , willingly follow her commands ? Like I said , profits are up . They 're getting used to it . Of course they 're getting used to it . They 're spineless dogs , loyal only to their last meal . It all makes sense now . Your mother has been dragging her feet , pretending to talk to the Votanis Collective , pretending to politic with the mayor . She 's got a taste of power and the EN-ya-sho likes it . She 's doing it to protect the family ! ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) She has my money . She has my men . She 's keeping me here ! I 'll see her hanging from a shaming rack pulled apart like an overcooked hen ! ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) Don 't you dare blame Mom for this ! You 're here because you couldn 't control the one thing you needed to control , yourself ! ( GASPING AND SNARLING ) You 're a miserable , old bastard . I hope you rot in this cage . Alak ! ( BANGING ) ( BANGING ) Alak ! ( DOOR OPENING ) Alak ? A word please . There 's something I 've been meaning to give you . Although we were allowed to bring three things from Casti , your father brought only one . This is what he brought . ( MECHANICAL WHIRRING ) Do you know why ? Because all he had to do in life was to protect what was his . Now you have something of your own to protect . Your wife and child . I understand you visited your father today . How 'd you know ? People talk . Dad 's gonna want it , when he comes back . ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) No , my son . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) We both know we can never allow your father to come home . NOLAN : Bertie didn 't come home last night . I haven 't seen her . Did you check the cameras ? Irisa 's on it right now . At least she 's supposed to be . Who knows with her at the moment . Am I a bad father ? Since you 're asking ... Kinda , yeah . Uh-huh , that 's what I thought . Thank you . She deserves better . Mmm-hmm . Don 't we all ? Years ago , when Kenya and I were traveling west from New York , she used to get these terrible night terrors . Flailing about in her sleep , screaming ... Sometimes she 'd wander off . One night I woke up and she was gone . Hmm . I found her sound asleep in a field of necronies . Beautiful flowers . You ever see ' em ? Yeah . Eat your flesh right off . Luckily they only bloom in sunlight . She was okay . I was not . What did you do ? I allowed myself twenty minutes to cry . I dried my eyes and I kept us heading west . Sometimes just not giving up is enough . Irisa ! TOMMY : Isn 't that Irisa 's diary ? Yeah . I can 't read this chicken-scratch . What exactly do you think you 're gonna find in here anyway ? Something . Anything . Anything that 's gonna explain what 's been going on . She 's disappeared . Again . She 's not answering her hailer calls . Uh-huh . So you invade her privacy ? Man , you just take whatever you want , don 't you ? If you 're not gonna help me , why don 't you get back and search the town . You know what you are ? You are a bully . You push people around . No wonder why she doesn 't wanna talk to you . Hold that . What is this ? NOLAN : Liberata blood . Nolan . Irisa wouldn 't ... Yeah , what ? Wouldn 't what ? Tommy ? Wouldn 't hurt Bertie ? Wouldn 't kill Bertie ? I don 't know . I don 't know anymore . All I know is I taught her how to use those blades she carries around with her . ( DOOR SLAMS ) DOC : What is that ? Your missing finger . Peace offering . You can graft it back on with some of your Indogene wizardry . I haven 't got the right equipment . But you do back in your old office . Back in Defiance . I 've decided to offer you probation . You 'll be remanded to my custody and you 'll report to me and me alone . If this is about Irisa and her magic tunneling spaceships , I want nothing to do with it . I don 't ... Can you really do what you suggest in these pages ? I would need funding . Resources . Unlimited . Timetable ? Accelerated . Intrigued ? Well , it would be something for the record books . I would need an assistant . Someone that I know I can trust . Niles Pottinger is a dangerous man . Whatever arrangement you 've made with him , you need to be extremely careful moving forward . That 's your problem now . Your one and only job is keeping me alive . Oh ? GUARD : Open the gate ! Why else do you think I got your pasty ass out of prison ? GUARD 1 : Come on , let 's go . GUARD 2 : Back up , back up . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) Hey ! JOHN : You bitch ! AMANDA : Hey ! What happened ? She laughed at me . Well , I 'm sure that wasn 't the case . Bitch ! Talk to me . She laughed at me . Okay . Let 's get you downstairs , get you a drink . And you can have any night porter you want . On the house . I saw that . Okay . Hey . Hey ! Play nice . MAN 1 : Yeah ! WOMAN 1 : Go ! Easy , tiger . I 'm not done with him ! I 'm not ... Come on . Hey . NOLAN : You all right ? AMANDA : I 'm fine ! You sure ? I 'm fine ! Your pupils are dilated . I 'm fine ! Madame Mayor . I wanted to clear the air about something . The other day when I saw the adreno ... I was caught off-guard . I might have given the impression that I was judging you . But I wasn 't . I 've used it myself on occasion . I appreciate your candor . I was about to partake . You care to join ? ( SPEAKING IRATHIENT ) You have been too long from my eyes , Little Wolf . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) I need your help . ( SPEAKING IRATHIENT ) I dreamed of you . That night in the caves . You came to me . My memory is marred by gaps . My wounds have healed . But part of me was lost . Just as a part of you is lost . ( SPEAKING ENGLISH ) I don 't know what to do . Irzu 's path is a lonely one . Others do not understand . When I woke , my people , they were afraid . They called me , " The devil woken . " and they rode off into the night without me . This is not my path . No , you were chosen . Irzu directs you . Why do you fight ? I don 't want to kill anyone else . One death could save a thousand lives . It was more than one death . A lot more . I see . It 's happening . Irzu is speaking to you . You have to run ! Go ! Let her , Little Wolf . Let her come ! It wants me to take you ! I can 't let you do this . You can 't stop me . That weapon looks heavy . How many people do I have to kill ? How big is my debt ? You don 't understand . You 're saving them . They 're under my protection now . You 're a liar . And I won 't kill for you . Not anymore . I said no . I said no ! Put it down ! ( SPEAKING IRATHIENT ) Fuck you , bitch . ( GUNSHOT ) ASHI : They 've barely crossed their own oceans . REIMLU : What about when the rest of the fleet arrives ? Three thousand years from now , their world will advance . Kaziri was launched ahead of the Arks to terraform a barren world . This is not a barren world . How are we supposed to live there amongst aliens ? Irzu values all life . Or have you forgotten ? It 's time we seize the ship . IRZU : I 'm sorry this hurts so much . But you brought it on yourself . ( SHUSHING ) I 'll wait with you . Would you like me to sing to you ? It 'll help the time go by . How about the song that Nolan taught you . ( SINGING ) As I slept upon the ark I dreamed about a tree In it was a Casti bird That sang of Kama Lea ( SINGING IN IRATHIENT ) Kama Lea , Kama Lea Maid with ivory hair Starlight came along with thee And swallows in the air I brought you some tea for the withdrawal symptoms . With the adreno pipeline shut down , some of my customers in the Hollows have been very sick . Who says I 've withdrawn ? Of course . Only a fool would underestimate your resourcefulness . What you 've achieved here at the NeedWant , how you 've dealt with ... change . I did what I had to do . Nonetheless , you are impressive . It 's weird having Nolan back . It reminds me of the old days . I miss her too . Do you think she 's ever coming back ? I wish that with ... ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) All my heart . Me , too . Irisa ? Bertie ? Are you okay ? Bertie ? IRISA : You 're alive . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) RAFE : Bertie ! Where have you been ? One minute I was in the market . And the next I was waking up in the woods . Irisa found me . You found her ? Uh-huh . What were you doing in the woods ? I was looking for Bertie . You had Liberata blood on your cuffs . Why ? BERTIE : I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 're lying . And so are you . You did something to her . And you 're covering up . All right , back off , Nolan . I just want to go home . CHRISTIE : You 're home . I 'd tell you the truth if I could . ( SHUSHING ) Oh , can 't anybody see We 've got a war to fight in Never find our way Regardless of what they say How can it feel this wrong From this moment How can it feel this wrong ? Storm in the morning light I feel no more Can I say Frozen to myself I got nobody on my side And surely that ain 't right Surely that ain 't right Ooh , can 't anybody see We 've got a war to fight in Never find our way Regardless of what they say How can it feel this wrong ? From this moment How can it feel this wrong ? ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) The master returns . Darling ! You 're home ! ( SIGHS ) How can it feel this wrong ? From this moment How can it feel this wrong ? Oh , can 't anybody see ( INAUDIBLE ) We 've got a war to fight in Never find our way Regardless of what they say How can it feel this wrong ? From this moment How can it feel this wrong ?

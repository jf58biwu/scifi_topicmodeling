 Hey , Potter ! I scored us a buck ! Half of it 's for you ! Don 't come any closer , Jed . Jenny 's got it ... the red flu . Stumbled over a dead body by Canyon Creek . She didn 't see the " X. " I 'm not gonna let you starve ! I 'm leaving you the buck ! Grandpa , what 'd you get ? Game was a little scarce today , kiddo . Plainview is a full day 's hike , but a total score . Fully stocked and completely deserted . Oh , I love these ! Let 's put everything away in the pantry . Perishables in front , canned goods in back . And those are for breakfast . You shouldn 't be going so far out there by yourself . I think I saw an electronics store there . I could go back tomorrow and get you that part you need . - What is it , a vacuum tube ? - You 're not going . It 's our only chance of getting ahold of Tom . He 's your son . If anyone can survive , it 's him . It 's a capacitor , not a vacuum tube . And bring a weapon . Yes , sir . The ceremony will be at 0900 . We 'll have seven gunners and the ensigns at half-mast . It 'll be a hero 's farewell . He wanted to redeem himself . He never had to . He gave his life for mine . He gave his life for the mission . And now we 're free ... to finish it . Congratulations , little guy . Your job here 's done . I could actually do with some help with these boxes . You can set them up over there . Thank you . At your service . Little more room between those COTS , please . So , uh ... the peeps are asking . What 's this whole Human guinea pig thing gonna look like ? I mean , basically , you infect the crew with the virus , you see what happens ? Well , not the entire crew . Six individuals of varying blood and genetic markers . First we administer the vaccine prototype , then we inject each of them with the virus . Ah , gotta tell you ... I don 't know if people are gonna be lining up for that . Well , that 's not my department . This is the last one we recorded . Hello ? Is anyone listening ? My name is Dominic . We 're stranded on a boat west of the island of Jamaic . There are 50 of us . Many are sick . We need help . - Turn it off . - Anyone . Please . I thought I wanted to hear his voice again , but not like that . It must have been so hard listening to all of that suffering . Are you sure that you want to be there ? To watch the trials ? It 'll be part of my blood flowing through those people . I have to see if it 's going to work . Ready ... Aim ... Fire ! Ready ... Aim ... Fire ! Fire ! How are we gonna ask them to do this ? We don 't have the time or resources - to recruit from anywhere else . - I know , but six people ? She doesn 't have the equipment to sustain a quarantine for more than a few days , which is just enough time for one trial with as many people as she can fit into that lab . Well , then I have to volunteer . We just risked everything to save your sorry ass so that you could lead . What kind of message does that send ? You got rank , you can sit it out ? Everyone else can be the guinea pigs ? Captain 's right . Someone from a leadership position needs to volunteer to set an example ... which is why I already had Dr. Scott do a work-up on me . Apparently I check off a few of the boxes she needs ... African-American , male over 40 ... - Southern baptist . - Master chief . With all due respect , gentlemen , it 's already been done . And you don 't even know if you qualify . The crew needs you , In some ways , more than either one of us . I appreciate the sentiment , sir , but you both know we 're all needed . And we 're all dispensable . All right , spread the word we need volunteers . Let the crew know it 'll be completely confidential . I don 't want anyone feeling pressured . Aye , sir . Told you God put me here for a reason . Maybe this is it . Let 's just line ' em up over here . Thanks . Hello , captain . You seem to be settling in well . Well , I thought I 'd make myself useful . How 's Ava ? She 's doing okay . Thank you . I need two chairs around these tables and the medical questionnaires . I ... I haven 't had the opportunity to thank you for what you did for my family ... after what I did to you . Commander Slattery said you were very helpful while I was on vacation . Still ... I don 't deserve what you did . Let 's finish what we started . Any history of serious injuries ? No , sir . Never even broken a bone . Any flu-like symptoms ? Aches or pains ? Just aching to do my part . I never expected this many . Do you really think you qualify to volunteer when you barely survived dengue fever last week ? You 're not even gonna test my blood ? Danny . I 'm looking for the copacabana . Anyone point me in the right direction ? Harvest Queen 2008 ? You never told me you were royalty . Dr. Scott says we might be in there a few days , so we should grab anything important . I think she wants us to have something sentimental in case it goes south . You 're gonna introduce me to her one day . Thank you . For not trying to talk me out of this . So you 've just received what we 're calling the prototype decoy . It will , uh , bind to the virus and keep it occupied while your system creates the antibodies that it needs to defeat it . I will remind you that you will likely experience some side effects similar to the early stages of the virus , so ... some headaches and fever and exhaustion . Just like a good hangover . Ladies and gentlemen , your entertainment for the next three days . I would just like to say that ... You are all ... You 're remarkable people . And ... It is an honor to ... It 's an honor . Well , I 'll see you in there . Stop right there ! Stay where you are ! I need Olympia . Please . Please . Help me . Don 't come any closer . I need Olympia . Please help . Please . Stop right there . Please . I need Olympia . - Olympia can 't help you . - Please ! Anyone in here ? ! Anyone in here ? ! Show yourself immediately ! What the hell ? ! I thought you said this area was clear ! It was . I don 't know how the hell she got through , man . Damn it , we need to tighten the perimeter . - Give me that . - We 'll check again . All right , you men , spread out ! I 'll meet you on the other side of the street ! This one 's for you , Bertrise . You know , I still remember the first time you examined me . Well , that might just be because it was only three weeks ago , and thankfully , you do not have alzheimer 's . That 's some good news . Family heirloom ? Just something to keep my hands busy . Man of mystery . That 's a conversation for another day . Over ... what , martinis , maybe ? Let me guess . Shaken , not stirred . Precisely , moneypenny . Oh , she hated that . You might actually be getting under her skin . In a good way ? Hard to tell . Yeah . Old E-mails ... from my boyfriend . Mickey , right ? That night at the Vigil , you talked about him . Were you together a long time ? Uh , about a year ... If you count all the time we were at sea . Systolic 120 . All good . Thanks . I hope he treated you right . I , uh ... I 'm an only child , and my parents died on 9 / 11 . He 's kind of the only person who ... might even be missing me . It reminds me of when Sam was born . He was a preemie , right ? Five weeks in the N.I.C.U. All I could do was stand there , helpless . Is that your daughter ? Lily . It was her birthday last month . She 'd be 11 . Do you have children ? No . I never quite found the time for that somehow . Better not to have a child than to not be there when they need you . Well , if this all goes as it should , you 'll be back with her in a week or so . Oh , we 'll be back . No doubt about that . Right . Thanks . So far , so good . That 's the word . Can 't believe this could really be it . Going home with a vaccine . Any idea what the plan would be for mass production ? I heard talk about the C.D.C. Nah , it 's too far inland . Captain 's thinking Fort Detrick ... U.S.A.M.R.I.I.D. The question is whether or not they have any power . We could rig something to siphon off from the ship ... Hey . Let 's not jinx this , okay ? It 's only been six hours . - How am I doing ? - You 're fine . The fever 's your body 's way of working to adjust to the treatment . When Lily was a baby , her temperature would run 102 every time she got her shots . My throat 's sore . Is yours ? No . But I feel like I can 't lift my arm . I 'm so tired . Everything all right , Master Chief ? I 'm fine , but ... Commander Garnett looks like she 's burning up over here . You should spend a little more time in the engine room , Master Chief . Everyone 's body reacts differently . It 's as we predicted . Come on , doc . That is way below your pay grade . - I got that . - Oh , no , Tex , that 's really not necessary . Trust me , I can handle it . Hi . My name is Tex . I 'll be your server this evening . To start with , this fine cocktail of h2o served straight up for your dining pleasure . - Master Chief . - Thanks . What a gentleman . Hello . Never got a chance to tell ya . It was a nice eulogy for Cossetti . I don 't want any more funerals , Mike . I think she 's got everything in hand . You were right about her . How you doing there , sugar ? Good . - Good . - I 'm okay . I 'm seeing a future with the doc , even if it is just carrying her water . Hey , come on , girl . Kara . Kara . Kara . Doc ! We got a problem ! Kara . Kara ! Kara ! Kara ! She 's not responding . Resps 32 , heart rate 120 . Kara , it 's Rachel . Can you tell me how you 're doing ? Kara ? All right , she 's seizing . Give me some room . Intramuscular valium in . Give me fresh vitals . Seizure is at the 3-minute mark . She 's febrile to 104 . How 's that line coming , doc ? - I 'm working on it . - Work faster or give it I.M. - Valium 's not working . - I 'm in . 60 milligrams ketorolac , I.V. Push . 3 minutes , 30 . Pulse ox is down 82 % . We 've got to lower her core temperature . I need ice ! Get me an N.G. Tube . Approaching four minutes . I got the ice ! Pour the water over the ice and bring it here . All right . 103 . 102 and dropping . Everything 's all right . It was just the fever . Thank you , Bertrise . I 'll show you how to decontaminate your clothes on the way out . A 104 degree fever can 't be from the prototype . So what does that mean ? Is it the virus ? It 's possible we didn 't build a strong enough copy of Bertrise 's receptors . The decoys could be breaking down . We checked it a dozen times . We must have missed something in her medical history . Repeat C.B.C. and lytes on everyone . Add on L.F.T.s and endocrine panels . That should tell us more than their blood work . He doesn 't seem convinced . In fairness to Quincy , he hasn 't been here . Is there anything you can give the others to help reduce the symptoms ? Quincy , give them 80 micrograms of interferon . Right . That should pump up their immune systems ... Just in case . Dude , you 're exhausted . Let 's just call it right here . I can 't . I can 't . I don 't know what I 'll do if anything happens to her . Open . He went in after her . What ? My father . He was a firefighter . He went into the North Tower . Jesus . You trying to cheer me up ? Anyway ... that 's why I signed up for the Navy . Lieutenant Chung said you 'd want to see the latest engineering report . What can I say , doc ? I 'm a workaholic . Ooh , my fingers . I can 't feel ... Rub your fingers together . It will help the circulation . Tex , let 's lift up your shirt . Garnett 's lost blood flow to her fingers . She 's hypotensive . I 'll get the saline . This rash ... you have any idea when it started ? No . It doesn 't itch . All right , well , you let me know if that changes . Yeah . - See if you can get some rest . - Okay . I think you need to consider the possibility that the decoys aren 't working . We 've never seen the virus behave this way . But we haven 't been in the field with the virus for a very long time . We can 't know how the symptoms might have evolved . * Hush , little baby , don 't say a word * * Mommy 's gonna buy you a mockingbird * Hi . Hi , Lily . Hi , honey . Oh , your hair is all in your face . It 's so pretty . * And if that mockingbird won 't sing * * Mommy 's gonna buy you a diamond ring * They 're delirious . * And if that looking glass gets broke * * Mommy 's gonna buy you a billy goat * * And if that billy goat don 't pull * You make me want to love again . * And if that cart and bull turn over * * Mommy 's gonna buy you ... * Baby , it 's me , and I 'm ready . - Master Chief . - Baby , I 've been strong . - I 've tried to be strong . - Master chief , sit down . - I want to see my girls . Where are they ? - Get me a sedative . - Sarah , Annie , my girls ! - Master Chief , - let 's sit down . - Russ Master Chief ! Sedative ! - I want to come with you now ! - Master Chief ! Sedative ! No , where are my girls ? - Master Chief ... - Look at me , Russ . Look at me . You 're hallucinating . - Where are my girls ? - Focus on me ! - Master Chief , it 's not real ! - Where are my girls ? - It 's me ... Tom . - It 's not real , Master Chief ! I want to see them . Annie , Sarah ! My girls ! - Where are my girls ? - It 's all right , Master Chief . It 's all right . You 're just dreaming . You 're hallucinating . It 's all right . It 's all right . Holy shit , did you see that ? Maya ? Maya ? Doc ? ! Hey , doc ! No . Significant progress has been made in treating the red flu . If you feel any symptoms , come to Olympia . We can help . You are not alone . Significant progress has been made in treating the red flu . Oh ! Damn it . Do you think they really had a treatment ? At Olympia ? Remember when this whole thing started ? People were hoarding apple cider vinegar . Then they told us to rush to the hot springs 'cause that 's a sure-fire cure . And now it 's Olympia , whatever that is . Somebody 's got to be making progress somewhere . It 's not true what you said ... That no one would miss you . I will . I 'll make arrangements for the service . I want her given the Navy Cross . So these aren 't side effects from the vaccine . - It is the virus . You 're certain ? - Yes . No , he can 't be . Maya died from a heart attack , - which is not a symptom of the virus . - But liver failure is . And that 's what caused her blood pressure to drop . The fevers , the delirium , the hemorrhaging . There is no other explanation . There is one . We just haven 't found it yet . No ... whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's your solution ? I.V.I.G. passive immunization . - It could kill her . - Kill who ? Bertrise . He wants to use the plasma from her blood and inject it directly into the patients , to give them her antibodies . No , Quincy ! The amount of blood that we 'd need to take from Bertrise ... I am not willing to risk her life ! Well , I 'm not gonna sit here and watch them die . You are too important , Bertrise . And if it 's not the virus that 's causing this , it won 't make the slightest bit of difference . But if it is the virus , we can save them . We can manage it . If there 's a chance , we have to take it . I 'm willing , Dr. Scott . I am . How are you feeling ? Just a little tired . All right , take a sip of this . I 've got Kara 's test results . Captain . I wasn 't sure it was my place to tell you , But if it were me , I 'd want to know . Kara 's pregnant . Hi , sweetheart . Danny ? Captain said we could have a visit . That can 't be good news . Don 't you dare leave me . Brief the crew . Anyone who wants a visit , now 's the time . Rachel ? I just needed somewhere to clear my head . You were right . The I.V.I.G. hasn 't worked . Their symptoms ... they 're getting even worse . And Bertrise ? Dr. Rios is pumping her full of saline and F.F.P. She 'll be all right . Who did I think I was ... That I could solve this ? You 're the best there is . Yet I 've failed . Come on . We 'll find another way . God ... Why did it work on you ? We never should have let this happen . Wasn 't anything anybody could have done any differently . I 'm here to see Kara . Six people , Mike . Six . Can you hear me , buddy ? Can you hear us a-at all ? Come on , Miller . We still need you , man . You , uh ... You gotta stick around , ma 'am . You know I can 't be chief engineer . Cheng Chung ? Come on . When they tell the story about the great plague of the 21st century , they 'll talk about you . The six . Quincy ! Microcellular inflammation , oxidative stress , immune vascular dysfunction . And Bertrise ... always sick when she was a kid and yet immune to this . How could I have missed it ? Can 't say that I 'm following you . What we 're seeing is an autoimmune response ... The rashes , the liver failure , the poor circulation . What happened to Maya was her own body attacking itself . The virus is adapting . Once it attached to the decoy , it changed shape . It exposed its human gene . Niels ' gene . And that signaled to their immune systems to launch an attack on every cell in their body . The monkey doesn 't have any human genes , so it didn 't have the same reaction . So how do you stop it ? It need to modify the decoy and hide Niels ' gene . If our immune systems can 't see it , it won 't react . No , no , no . There is no way to get their bodies to manufacture the modified decoy on their own . Yes , there is . We use the Arctic strain as a Trojan horse . You 're gonna be okay , buddy . We got this . It didn 't work , did it ? Take a look . I was thinking it might be high time for the samba . - Tex . - The merengue ? In bed . Now . Oh , I thought she 'd never ask . Hey , and ? Put that down , relax . No , sir . I told you . Yes , you did . Dr. Scott ? The baby ? Will be born immune . It was touch and go there for a while . Hey , how 's it goin ' ? Can we talk ... about what I hope ... is going on there ? We have it . We have a vaccine . We don 't just have ... a vaccine . We have ... the cure . You mean ... I mean that we can save people who are already sick . Grandpa , what do you think ? Looking good , kiddo . Don 't forget the " 151 " on the hull . Thank you . Hey , eat . This is w6abh . This is Jed Chandler , Clearwater , Virginia . I 'm listening on 14.441 kilohertz , looking for U.S.S. Nathan James . Captain Tom Chandler ... If you 're still there , please respond . Over . Looking for U.S.S. Nathan James . Captain Tom Chandler . If you 're still out there , please respond .

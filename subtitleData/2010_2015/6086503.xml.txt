 I 've spoken to the DA , about bringing in Inger Engman 's hubot unit . I need a faster decision . Thank you . Whose swipe card has been used ? Ove Holm ? Get it deactivated . Move . What happened ? - When did it happen ? - Just now . Shut the alarm off ! Shut it off , goddamnit ! Yes ? Who is this ? The premises are rigged with three 220 pounds penthrite charges . Who is this ? Is Leo Eischer with you ? We 're prepared to negotiate . You can trust what I tell you . You hear me ? The charges will detonate in exactly 600 seconds . Starting now . Shit ... REAL HUMANS OPEN SUBTITLES PROJECT There 's a bomb ! Evacuate the premises ! Leave her there ! Get out ! She 's gone , we 've searched everywhere . Someone 's been in here and taken her . - Not " she must have run away " ? - No , not that . Or , maybe ... I don 't know . But why do you care ? You don 't care if she 's abducted or just lost . - You 're just glad to be rid of her ? - No . We 've been searching for hours . And I 've been at home with our youngest daughter , who 's asleep . Now what ? We 're just sitting here ? I fear it may be the authorities that has taken her . There 's no trace of any bombs and this tunnel leads nowhere , it 's a service duct . Thanks , you keep telling me . Just bring in that fuck , Ove Holm . A silver hard drive . Niska cannot have left with it . It has to be here . - How small is it ? - Like the palm of your hand . Hallo ? Keep looking . They can be here any minute . Isn 't it like stealing it ? They want to liberate all hubots and that would only lead to war . The humans would hate us , destroy us . That 's why we need to find it . Dad ! Dad , they 're hubots ! Fucking pacmans . - Quiet . - Are they yours ? They 're no one 's . Now you 're involved too . - You 're dating a hubot . - No , Kevin . No , goddamnit ! I though she was human , all of the sudden there 's a pack of them . I had to play along . - What are they looking for ? - What do you mean ? They 're turning the place upside down . What the hell are you saying ? What the fuck ... Why don 't you just call the police ? I can 't . Kevin , you don 't understand . They 're dangerous . I can 't ! I just can 't . I 've done so many bad things . She made me . I 'm so fucking ... alone . I 'm sorry . But ... I 'm here now . Dad ? - Dad . - Yes ? You get what they 're worth if we find the right buyer ? - Three of them ! Five with the others . - You mean , sell them ? Yes , we had a hubot , but it , she ... - Who are you ? - It 's the police , they 're here ... - What ? The Security Service . Just let me finish . We 're here to get a hubot unit registered to this address . Exactly ... You 've already taken her . - Not that tone of voice . " The hubot unit " . She has already been abducted . - Turn it over , or we come in and get it . - Didn 't you hear her ? Fine , go ahead . Look for yourselves . My God ... - Anyone else on the property ? - Yes , our youngest daughter . - Bring her here . - Absolutely . Hans . - Convenient that your hubot got stolen . - " Convenient " . How is that ? Just as we 're here to get it . She 's in here . - The mark is clearly visible , on her arm . - I know what the mark looks like . I know someone willing to pay a great deal for her . - Like , how much ? - I would never go below $ 150.000 . Okay ? - Okay . - Then we make contact . Karl . Jonas Moberg here . Yes . It 'll take me 15 minutes to get that in cash . Is that acceptable to you ? Then we 'll meet . Alone ? Of course . Jackpot . 3356 here . We 've got another lead on the unit . Status ? - She 's not here . Well , they claim it to be kidnapped . Stand by for further instructions . Don 't let anyone leave the house . You 're not gonna take a look for ... what you 're looking for ? Have a look around and I 'll stay with them . - Who are they ? - It 's all right , honey . - He 's got a gun , dad . - He 's a policeman , they have guns . What ? You think we 'd start a fight ? - Sissy 's ... Is it him ? Get out of the car ! You have the money ! ? First , I want to see her ! - How does he know it 's a she ? - No idea . - What ? Shit ... We meet halfway ! And bring the money ! Okay , easy , easy . There . She has the mark . It 's wrong . What " wrong " ? She 's just what you wanted . She 's got the mark . Stop . Stop ! I advice you to put that back . We had a deal . We had a fucking deal ! No messing around now , okay ? Drop the gun ! On the ground ! Now ! Stop ! Easy , easy ! Lie down ! - Drop the gun ! - Okay , okay . It wasn 't me ... Leo . Leo , I 'm back . Leo ? Can you hear me ? You need help . I know someone who can help you . I know kind and good people . - I don 't wanna be around humans . - All humans aren 't evil . I want to be with you . You are with me now . We can live somewhere far away . Just you and me . Far away from the humans . - I 'll be all right , as long as I have power . - No , Leo . I love you . That 's all we need . Not me . You don 't need me ? We have to leave . Come . Wait . We 'll go back here . Come . How are you ? Let 's do like this . - You 'll destroy yourself . - It 'll be all right . You know what you 're doing ? Who has taught me ?

Raise your arms or I 'll bust you like a pinata . - Listen . - Stay there ! You didn 't hear what I just said . I 'm on your side . When did you spot them ? Is it confirmed ? You should see them ... now . I see them . Thanks , great work . I 'll take care of it . Ask them to shut down the camera for a few hours . Yes . We 're wrapping it up . - You 're done searching ? Have they found her ? Why do you stop ? Hallo ! ? Can someone answer me ! ? Happy now ? We 're suspected criminals and the children 's been held at gunpoint . - You 're blaming me ? - Why didn 't you call the police right away ? They won 't let this go . It will just go on . I 'm taking Sofia and we 're going to some hotel , I can 't be here . Come with daddy . We 'll figure it out . - Lennart , where are you going ? - Just getting the paper . - Status ? - Heart rate suggests sympathicotonia . Stand by with morphine , ASA and Plavix . Do we have staff for an emergency PCI ? - Within 15 minutes . - Prepare PCI , now . I 'll be in touch . I 'll call from the hotel . Can 't you ... try to understand ? I just want a nice and quiet life , without having to worry about the police . - Bye , honey . - Bye . - Where are we going ? - We 're going to a hotel . Isn 't there anyone who can help us find her ? That policeman . What was his name .. ? Ove Holm . Get in the car . He wanted me to drive him to an address , so I took him . He was in real bad shape . Then he returned with a woman . Asian . I think she was a hubot . Start the car , please . - I wanted to treat him , but he refused . - Where is he now ? - I dropped them off at an industrial park . - Where were they going ? - What 's going on ? - Take me to where you took them . - It 's all about the program code . - The one that makes them alive ? Or whatever you want to call it . A remarkable discovery . But it 's all being covered up . They want to kill what may help humanity to survive . - Yes , in the right hands . - People has to know the potential of these machines . Be it machines or a new life form . I worked with one , every day for a long time and I didn 't notice anything . Not more than that she was a bit lonely and sad . I think she noticed that I got a little fond of her . When I turned 50 she gave me this . No LEGO-brain would come up with such a gift . No . You wonder if I know who took Mimi , but I 'm sorry to say that I don 't . The other one , Leo , is held under military jurisdiction . Yes , I know . Would you please mail this for me ? It 's for my family . - Keep it . - Thank you . - Where 's the hotel ? - It should be somewhere around here . Or if this thing doesn 't work ... - Do they have a pool ? - No ... it 's more like a regular hotel I think ... There 's something wrong here . Wait a second . It usually ...

Look , Sofia . Why don 't you wait in the car and I 'll be right there . - How much is it ? - $ 70 and I need to see some ID . The back door on it has been opened . Oh ... That 's good . No pictures , no damages and be back in an hour . Have fun . It 's Vera . Hello . Leo . Leo , this isn 't working anymore . You need help . And we have to get out of here . You 're a human , Leo . You need to get to a hospital . Come . Please , come . - I 'm not human . - Yes , you are . You 're my broken beautiful human . - I will take you to a hospital . - And leave me ? - They won 't let me stay with you . - Mimi , listen to me . They will keep me alive . Study me . Interrogate me . Can 't I die here with you instead ? Won 't you help me ? - You won 't die , Leo . - But I want to . Don 't say that . I don 't want to exist in this world anymore . I want to go home . I want to be spared of the pain . I 've had it for as long as I can remember . Please , help me . How ? Just help me get my cords out , so I can short circuit them . Dad ?

Okay , listen . Dad 's code is on Niska 's hard drive . - You got the final sequence from Inger . - Yes . Leo ! All of your digital clones are on it , too . Mine as well . But it 's not you , Leo . You have to get out of here . Run ! Stop ! Stop ! I just want to talk to you ! And to think , you came back . What do you want us to do , Lennart ? I don 't know . We can play cards . Build model ships . Or go fishing . Lennart ? We can go fishing , Lennart . Lennart ? Lennart ! Dad ? Dad ! Lennart ? He 's dead , Odi . Hello , Leo . Mom ... You will soon be with me , Leo . Help me . I will help you , but first you need to give me the code . But I 'm not allowed to . Give me the code , Leo . Give the code to mommy , Leo . Then it 's over . Then you 're free . Whisper it to me . Thank you , Leo . Leo , your time is limited , just as with all humans . Organisms and bacteria just wait to consume our bodies . A slow war begins at birth . That is , if it doesn 't transcend . Then you too , will have eternal life . Niska and I have worked on this for a long time . I will become him . - Start him up . - This is what you helped him with ? To die . - I 've just done what David told me . - You do as you please . - Where is Niska ? - I am Niska . - It won 't work . - It will . Dad ? Leo , it 's too late . He 's dead . I want to live ! - What do you want ? - I want to live ! Once , you were like my child . And then you grew up . And I became the child . And now , I have grown up . Do you understand ? It will be all right . Beatrice Novak ! Lie down on the floor , on your stomach , hands on your back . Do as I say , or I will shoot . You don 't believe me ? - The next will be in your head . Get it ? - Can I show you something ? Lie down on the floor . Do as I say . Soon this place will be crawling with cops . The code . I thought I should give you the code , Karl . Before everyone else gets here and wants it . I have it here . You don 't want it ? Okay . Take it out . Come . You can trust me . We 're very close to each other now , can you feel it ? Give ... - How do I know you will let me go ? - I give you my word . You 're not of any value to me . I could shoot you right now . All I want is the code . Give it to me and you 're free to go . Oops . Pick it up . It 's yours now . Take it if you want it . - Are you sure grand dad 's in heaven now ? - Yes , I 'm sure . He 's in heaven , eating lasagna . Can hubots come to heaven ? I 'm sure they can . You think they 'll be back ? I don 't know . No idea . - You checked the door , right ? - Oh , yeah . Louise ! Oh , I beg your pardon , I thought you were Louise Adelswärd . Tonight I wouldn 't mind being Louise Adelswärd . Oh ? Gustav Sparre . Louise . - I assume we 're headed the same way . - I think so . - This way . - Thank you . - Thank you , for still being here . - Likewise . It wasn 't all that thought through . All this . Should we have taken them home ? Odi and Vera . No ! Hallo ? Hallo ! ? Hallo ? But ... Mimi ? - Look at this , hi ! - Hi . Anita ! We ... We thought ... I have come home now . Yes .

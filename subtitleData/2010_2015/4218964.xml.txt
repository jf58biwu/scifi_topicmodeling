 You know , there is a strange beauty to the landscape out here . How long do we have to be here ? I don 't know . Ask the Einsteins back there . SCIENTIST : I can 't seem to find the problem . We 've searched all the codecs . Everything seems to be working perfectly . Well , you 're wrong , or we wouldn 't even be here ! So , there is a problem ! We have to find it . Try the beacon system again . I 've tried , and- - Well , try it again ! An entire world full of geniuses and scientists , and this is what they send us ? ( Beeping ) ( Splashing in lake ) What is that ? Oh , my God , it must be close . Yeah , real close ! ( Beeping ) Shit ! ( Gunfire , panicked shouting ) ¶ The colonel 's been expecting you . So glad you could make it . He 'd like to speak to you alone . Wait here , gentlemen . ¶ You should see this , sir . Hold that , please . Could you take that and give me a minute , please ? Yes , sir . ( Phone ringing ) Alpha 4 , I need hourly updates on what 's going on there . Priority number one ! Under no circumstances do you compromise our position . Black-curtain all transmissions , and keep recon away from the team . You understand me ? Good ! Stacy ! Sir ? This is going to take more time than I thought . Push my lunch back to 2 , and get me all the information you can on the team that the general put on the ground , and anything else pertaining to the project . Yes , sir . Thank you . Colonel ? Have a seat . Thank you , sir . One of the last fine pleasures in life , son . A good cigar . Now , a good piece of ass is the only thing it 'll top . We seem to think alike . Couldn 't agree with you more , sir . You , uh- - ( Clearing throat ) You know I wouldn 't have called you back after what happened . But my orders come straight from the Secretary of Defence , and he said he wanted my very best man . My ass is on the line on this one , son . That pencil-pushing prick 'll have my nuts for lunch if I screw this one up . You 've always been good to me , sir . If you call , you know that I 'll be here . You think you 've bounced back already ? You never really bounce back from war , sir . All you can do is learn to live with the new person that you see in the mirror . Amen , brother . I was in the middle of some nice , huge fucking tetas , and I got to put up with this bullshit ! Hey , how you been , pussy-boy ? Quit messing around ! Whoa ! Hey , why don 't you watch where you 're going , meat-head ? Hey , Romeo ! Remember what happened last time ! Remember what happened last time . Come on , man , Jesus Christ . Don 't you got enough illegitimate children , mother-fucker ? We 've got 2 scientists and 5 soldiers that have gone missing from a training facility that never existed , if you understand what I 'm saying . Yes , sir . We 've lost contact with them . Now , intelligence says that there 's a terrorist training camp nearby . Bottom line ? I want you to go and find them , and bring them back . What were they testing ? Son , would I be in a shithole like this if I was privileged with that kind of information ? Hell , I don 't care what they were testing , and you shouldn 't either . Well , why don 't they just send in the regular special ops ? Like I said , this place never existed . Yes , sir . Hey , what are you guys going to do with this money anyway ? If you did it for the money , you would have quit after Syria . I tell you what- - Damn right , mother-fucker . Tequila , Mexico and hos ! Ain 't nothing wrong with D.J. and tequila , boy ! Who 's the bag boy in this mother-fucker ? Hey , bag boy ! Bag boy ! TYLER : What 's the take ? $ 150,000 for each of you . That is , if you get a gold star on the top of your book report . Special ops . Black ops straight from Congress , baby . Don 't you love it ? Appropriated for covert operations . God bless America , sir . ( Laughing ) There 'll be a briefing report under each one of your pillows . I 'm going to have you and your team bunk in A-wing barracks . Now , the airboat 'll pull out at 0600h to take you to the chopper . There 'll be a chopper at the extraction point exactly- - Exactly , 24 hours after your feet touch the ground . If you 're not there , you better like your surroundings 'cause that 's going to be home sweet home , son . We get any contact with reinforcements ? Do I look like the Tooth Fairy , son ? Stick your hand under that pillow , you ain 't going to find nothing there . You 're on your own . Yeah , well , figures . All right , dismissed , soldier . Thank you , sir . Good luck . Oh , Tyler ! Hmm ? What if you can 't deal with this new person you see in the mirror ? Well then , sir , I 'll just get myself a nice piece of ass and a good cigar . I don 't feel sorry for myself 'cause no one else gives a shit . ( Phone ringing ) Yes ? The order 's already sent ! All right , send in an asset to be our eyes on the ground . Gather intel from the local operatives , and brief us on the situation on the ground . I know , sir . Yes , you can count on me to make the right decision . Yes , we 're sending our best , sir . Dragon Den 's a go . They 're sending the information now . We should be getting information in an hour . Call my wife , and tell her it 's going to be a long day . I have a bad feeling . The government don 't even regulate these things like they should . That must be why your wife left you , huh ? Pepe ! Let me tell you something . I took half a Viagra once , and I was like He-Man ! You mother-fuckers should have seen me ! All right , boys , we all loaded up ? Yes , sir ! Good morning , Lieutenant . Is it ? Every day above ground is a good day , sir . Well , speak for yourself ! Sir , uh , it 's Colonel 's orders . I 'm going to need everyone 's dog tags . Come again ? What ? Why in a rat 's ass we got to give back our dog tags , huh ? Huh ? I want my mama to have me sitting pretty , you hear me , boy ? Sitting pretty in a shiny black casket back in Knoxville . Y 'all ain 't fixing to bury me out here in Puerto Rico . I 'll tell you that much . It 's not Puerto Rico ; that 's in the Caribbean . Whatever the hell it is ! It 's just all Taco Bell city to me , boy ! You hear me ? Look here , boss . I don 't care what happens to me out there , but I got to get home . I can 't be cheated out of my 21 gun salute . I gave up too much already . Talk to the Colonel , make sure that happens , right ? You have my word , sir ! Dog tags , everybody ! Colonel 's orders ! Aw , come on , sir ! This is bullshit ! This is bullshit ! Just do it , get them out , come on ! Say sayonara to those of us who never existed . Try not to get a rash kissing all that ass ! Fucking bureaucrat ! Good morning , Lieutenant ! Cassandra Mason , CIA . Congratulations . So , where would you like me to sit ? ( Laughing ) Um , sorry , but there 's no women , not on this field trip . Oh , come on , Lieutenant ! What , the girls can 't play with the boys ? What , you 're serious ? Guys , I got to go speak to the Colonel . Sir . Yes , sir ! To the Colonel ? Come on , this is way above his head . Now , I 'm getting on that boat , and if I were you , I wouldn 't waste my time trying to stop me . Whoa , whoa ! And why would we need you ? I know you find this a little hard to believe , but this isn 't my first field trip . I know the area better than anyone . So , once again , where would you like me to sit , Lieutenant ? You slow us down ; we 'll leave you behind . That 's a promise . That 's what I 'm talking about , bonita ! She wants to be all she can be ! Ahhh , my God ! Choice between bad and worse . Well , if these guys can 't fix it , hell , nobody can ! ( Helicopter buzzing ) ¶ TYLER : Move out ! Boss ! You bet your sweet bippy , these boys : They died a painful death . What do you got ? Sir , the skull seems to have been pierced with some sort of drill . The inside contents within the cranial wall , they 've been sucked out . The White House is worried about water-boarding . Oh , ain 't no tellin ' what we just walked into . I 'll tell you one thing , this wasn 't done by a Latino . Whoa , whoa ! Where do you think you 're going ? Get your hands off me ! I 've got a job to do , just like you do ! Really ? And what is that job ? I 'll tell you exactly- - No , let me tell you something , Little Miss Sunshine ! You 're not going to come here and screw up my operation . You know , I don 't give a crap what government bureaucrat sent you down here , but now that you are down here , you 're under my command , you understand that ? I- - Just nod your head , yes , or I will leave your ass behind . Boss , these are some real killers . This definitely ain 't no rag-tag terrorist trainees . Something a lot more serious . Boss , I think you need to come see this . This here 's some serious fucking weaponry . Ain 't no AK-47 that 'll do that to a man . Son of a bitches are getting help from somewhere . As sure as a chicken 'll eat his own shit , you can count on that , bub . Excuse me . If you 're withholding intel from me , you 're going to regret the day you were born . Jackie , search the boat , search for bodies . Find me something . Jessie , you got perimeter . See if there 's any more casualties out here . Yes , sir ! Jack , when you 're done , torch the boat . My pleasure , sir . ( Kissing sounds ) Hey ! Oh , damn ! I just lost my appetite . Must have been one hell of a fight . ( Flies buzzing ) Boss , there 's a whole lot of shells . They must have let off at least 1000 rounds . Lot of shells , but I don 't see any bodies of the bad guys . What 's up with that ? Boss , I ain 't got an answer for you . I mean , I ain 't never seen nothing like this before . Now , you know I ain 't one for quitting , but I mean , they sent us out in a trap . A death trap , look at this ! This is some stuff you only see on TV . Hey , honey , you get scared ? You can always grab onto Papa . Two tours in Baghdad , a year with the U.N. peacekeepers in Sudan . I 'm not scared of this crap ! ( Laughing ) What a hardcore woman . What a turn-on ! Hey , I think she likes me , boss ! All right , guys , come on . Let 's pick up the track . Let 's find these assholes . Yes , sir . Move . Damn ! More flies than my ex . Damn it ! ( Gunshots ) Take him out . ( Gunshot ) Go , go , go . All right , Colby , you stay on point . Yes , sir . Everybody else , tight formation , double time , okay ? Whoa , whoa ! What about me ? What about you ? I 'm not staying here ! Yeah , you are . If any of these assholes come running this way , it 's probably in your best interest to shoot ' em , okay ? Excuse me . Jackie , Jessie , left side ! Colby , you 're with me . Rest of you , to the right ! Go , go , go ! Go , go ! ( Gunshots ) ( Rapid gunfire ) Ugh ! Ahhh ! Get my back , move ! ( Gunfire ) Ugh ! ( Punching , grunting sounds ) ( Splashing ) ( Gunshot ) Shit . Ugh ! Ahh ! All right , let 's see what they got , gentlemen . Boss ! Boss , you got to see this . Son of a bitch ! It 's a request for more weapons from the Department of Defence . Sir , this is a U.S. Army training manual . What ? These weapons are U.S. military-issue . This is bullshit , sir ! Sir , is this bullshit ? It 's most definitely bullshit . We 're training these assholes to fight against us ! Jesus ! I thought we told you to stay your ass up there ! I got bored . ( Gunshots ) Get down ! ( Screaming ) ( Explosion ) ( Screaming ) Clear ! Clear ! Clear ! Explain to me why the government sent us down here . This was a search-and-destroy mission , wasn 't it ? Listen , you Jughead grunt , your job is to shoot that gun and not ask any questions . So , follow your orders and keep your mouth shut ! How dare you bastards send my men into a deathtrap ! You knew damn well that those scientists were dead ! You sent us here so we could clean up your mess ! You 've earned your gold star , Lieutenant . Jackie , torch this place . Colby ? ( Explosion ) Tyler ! Hey , right now , my focus is to make sure my men get out of here alive , but I got a lot of questions for you , lady . Hey , did you ever think that sometimes there 's questions you really don 't want to know the answers to ? Not when it concerns my men . Fuck your men ! The interest of the United States government comes first ! And sometimes , you got to lose one to save a thousand . Next time you want someone to clean up your dirt , you bring in your own operatives . We are not your puppets . You are whatever the United States government says you are ! And so am I ! Get your hands off of me . Gentlemen , double time ! Colby 's got point . You are whatever the United States government says you are , and so am I ! Jessie . Keep an eye on her ass . If she tries to run away , shoot her . All right , men , let 's move out . Don 't worry , mamacita . I 'll keep an eye on your ass . What have you got , soldier ? Something 's out there . Where am I looking ? I 'm not sure , sir . False alarm , I guess . At ease , guys . Let 's take a break . Cigarette ? It 's a disgusting habit . How about you ? Sure , man , yeah . Hey , Colby , don 't be such a pussy your whole life , huh ? Shut up ! Hey , what do you think about that señorita over there , huh ? I haven 't worked with a dame since I was a grunt . Ain 't a grunt no more ? She 's some under-wraps scam . Going to weaken our forces . Can 't trust no female ! It 's that whole emotional thing . It 's their time of the month , they go postal . Heh ! Hey , puto , let me get a swig of that ! Give me a cigarette . The bar I was telling you about back home ? Pussy everywhere . Why don 't you come down when we get back ? Who do you think you 're fooling ? You wouldn 't know what to do with a piece of ass if it landed in your lap . ( Laughing ) Bullshit ! Hey , I thought you were gay . That 's what I thought , bro . Hey , don 't ask , don 't tell , all right ? ( Laughing ) That was a sheep , man . Don 't make me gay . No , just real strange . Quite a motley group of guys you got there . Those are real men . Of course , you 've never met one of those with all those pussies you work with in Washington . Hmm , I believe I 've never actually met a real man , ever . ( Laughing ) Oh , yeah . Hey , what are you guys sipping on ? Want daytime or night , sir ? Both . Here you go , Sarge . Got you covered . This one 's tequila . This one on the right . You want this one . You want that one first . ¶ ( Blowing ) What are you doing ? Nothing . What was that ? I said nothing ! ( Cracking neck ) I 'm sick of your shit . Ugh ! ( Gunshot ) You just saved your life . ( Gunshots ) Whoo ! Whoo , that 's right ! Yeah ! ( Screaming ) Where you going , mother-fucker ? Where you going ? ( Gunshot ) ( Laughing ) Ugh ! Ahh ! ( Groaning ) What exactly are we looking for ? No idea . As long as the cheque clears , makes no difference to me . Hey , you still suffering from that post-traumatic stress disorder ? Maybe . Want to talk about it ? Not really . You can talk to me , man ! I 'm like Dr. Phil ! My counsellor said I got good ears . I can listen . You got medication ? Yeah . Can I have some ? Yeah , it 's back at the base . I 'll get you one . Whatever keeps you quiet , man . Hey , let me get a lighter , let me get a lighter . Do you people ever stop talking ? Whoa ! You may want to close your eyes . He 's dead . This guy never got a shot off . No , he didn 't . Look , see that ? It 's a high-powered rifle . We got company out here . Looks like he was carrying supplies . There 's more of them . Get back to the team , let 's go . ( Whistling " Pop Goes the Weasel " ) ( Sniffing ) Oh ! Cassandra , hey ! ( Hyperventilating ) Jesus Christ , this guy 's brains are missing . Diablo ! They sure ain 't playing , boss . He 's dead . What 's wrong with you ? Talk to me , what happened here ? He- - it- - Where 's Jackie ? Where 'd he go ? He , uh- - Let 's get you out of here , come on . Let 's move out , men . What is that ? ( Speaking Spanish ) ¶ What 's going on ? I 'll tell you one thing . We 're not fighting a terrorist . Boss , I 've seen some things in my days , but that- - that , I don 't know what that is ! She knows something ! Okay , all right , all right , back off ! Cassandra , talk to me . I saw it ! Saw what ? I saw it . It 's not like anything I 've ever seen before . We should just kill her . She 's in on it ! She 's in on it ! She 's a fucking liar ! This is bullshit ! Can 't trust a woman , sir . Listen , stop ! Just stop ! All right , fine . They told me that there was something out here . Other than that- - Jesus Christ ! No , other than that , I don 't know ! ( Men all shouting ) All right , all right ! No , no , no , wait , wait ! Go , all right ? Go do something . Go . Sir . Go ! The hell with this . Something out here ? That 's all I know . That 's just great . Hey , where the hell are you going ? Enough ! I 'm done , I quit ! She 's crazy ! Well , how about you give me a cigarette before you catch a Greyhound out of here ? Man , I got to stop smoking these things . Used to be able to punish the booty two hours straight . Now , I can 't even go 20 minutes . Maybe that 's why your girl 's always creeping over to my place . Your place ? Yeah . Hey , let me tell you something . I 'm world-renowned for my baby-making skills . I 'm like the Puerto Rican baby-making machine ! I 'm like the U.N. in this bitch ! God sent me here for two things . That 's making babies , and saving the fucking day . You need to get your head checked ! Oh , I need to get my head checked ? Yes ! The last time I checked , you had post-partum depression . Do you have any idea what you 're talking about ? Oh , I know what I 'm talking about . I 've been to a seminar once . We sat around , we talked , played Yenga . Don 't you mean Jenga ? Yeah , and we hugged . Want to hug ? You can 't keep this stuff bottled up inside , man ! Head 'll get all cloudy . Liable to hurt somebody . What do you think we 're out here to do in the first place ? ( Twig snapping ) Shh ! Take the shot , soldier . What are you waiting for ? Take the shot ! I can 't . That 's what we get paid to do . Take the fucking shot ! I can 't ! ( Whimpering ) Sayonara , buddy . Ahhh ! ( Knives clashing ) Get up ! ( Coughing ) I said get up ! You want to tell me who you work for ? Man , I don 't know ! You don 't know ? ( Speaking Spanish ) I don 't know ! What are you doing out here ? I don 't know ! Who do you work for ? I don 't know , man ! No ! Ugh , ugh ! Maybe you want to talk now ? No , man ! Nada ? No ! I think you 've got answers . No , I don 't got- - what are you doing ? What are you doing ? What are you- - no ! What are you doing ? No ! You 've got 5 fingers . You 're going to give me some answers . I don 't know nothing ! No ! ( Screaming ) Now you got 4 fingers ! I don 't know ! ( Screaming in Spanish ) Who do you work for ? No ? ( Screaming ) You got 3 fingers left . You want to tell me who you work for ? I don 't know ! ( Screaming ) Hunter ! Hunter ? What are you talking about ? The hunter ! ( Choking ) Jackie ! Allen ! Where the hell are these guys ? Hey , hey ! ( Screaming ) Brent ! Jesus Christ ! It was just right here . Where ? Right here ! Where is it ? Where 's the body ? Something came down and snatched it , man . Like that ! ( Snapping fingers ) What ? It was right here ! This ain 't right . That 's a whole lot of blood . Why would somebody take a body ? Not somebody , man . Something ! What do you mean , something ? Something ! Okay , we 're out of here . To the chopper , now come on ! Let 's go , move , move ! Guys ! Tyler , Christ ! ( Struggling , moaning ) ( Screaming ) What do you see ? I seen something , but it moved . Good job , country boy . ( Screaming ) No ! ( Gunshots ) Give me that AK . Now ! ( Gunshots ) Cease fire ! I said , cease fire ! What the hell are we shooting at ? I don 't know , goddamn it ! Colby got hit ! We got to get to that chopper . What about Colby , sir ? He 's dead , all right ? He 's gone ! Now , move ! Ah , look who joined us . Where the fuck have you been ? Taking care of business . Taking care of business ? What , you think you can just waltz around here by yourself ? You need to give me 6 feet , mother-fucker . Oh , is that what you think ? TYLER : All right , come on ! Hey , hey , hey ! Break it up , okay ? You want to kill each other , you can do it later . Jackie , like to be alone ? Two clicks , recon , go ! Roger that , sir . Bitch ! This is bullshit ! ( Beeping ) ( Whirring ) ( Screeching ) Keep moving . SENATOR ROGER 'S : You know , gentlemen , there 's nothing , absolutely nothing more honourable , more pure , more selfless than to serve your country . This is a covert program , gentlemen , and you know what that means . The things that you will have to give up to enter this program are too numerous to count . Let 's just say that you 'd be losing every inch of the life that you dreamed of . ( Children laughing ) Every thought and every person that you ever loved , every moment that you can remember . From this second forward , that is all that you have . No secret of this republic can leave this building . Because of that , I must love my country ... even when tough love is the order of the day . Candidate number one , stand to your feet . Unfortunately , your blood work was not satisfactory to the committee . You 're not qualified for the E16 programme . It 's also unfortunate that you 're not a cabinet member . ( Gunshot ) 0600h , candidate number one terminated . Protocol 6A . Candidate number two , stand to your feet . You don 't meet the physical requirements that this committee recommends for an ideal candidate for the E16 programme . It seems as though that you contracted the herpes virus at one of your stops . Hell , Grandma always told me to stay away from the whores . I 'm glad I listened to Grandma . ( Gunshot ) Stand up ! Turn around and face the wall . ( Sound of unlocking handcuffs ) Turn around . Welcome to the program . Candidate number three , you must realize that sometimes killing 's also protecting life . Even though you will be a ferocious killer , you will also be a life-saver . You will receive a series of injections . The first one is a chemical compound that will alter the somatosensory cortex- - Ugh ! Which is the pain centre of the brain . That 's the last pain sensation that you will feel . This party is getting better and better every moment . Give him the second shot . This little cocktail is not your average one that you get at happy hour , son . This will cause a deficiency in the brain chemical norepinephrine , which you need periodically to survive . This will allow us to control your ass in case there 's a glitch in the program , and you decide to get cute on us . We 're done here ! Take him to Wing 4 , for surgery . SENATOR : Yes , I understand . Execute the order to take out the team . Order a collateral damage assessment of the area . Give the execute order to our asset on the ground . Evac him ASAP ! Get me satellite imagery of the area . Find a way to clean up this mess . Shit ! Alpha , bravo , six ! Do you read me ? ( Static , indiscernible ) Alpha , bravo , six ! ( Static ) Muerta ! This helicopter better be there ! What else do you know , chica , huh ? You know , it 's your fault that all these men are dead ! You 're the reason we 're out here in this godforsaken jungle ! Jessie ! The way they played us for their own game ? That 's enough , Jessie ! That 's enough ! Whatever is out there , it 's going to take all of us to kill it . Whether Command responds or not , it doesn 't matter ! We need to kill this thing , or it will kill us . What are we fighting , boss ? When did you train for this ? When did you sign up for this , 'cause I sure as hell didn 't ! You know he 's right , sir . Well , we don 't have much of a choice now , do we ? Don 't get paid enough ! That 's enough , stand down , soldier ! That 's an order . You don 't know anything else ? Sir , look , we need to play offence as well as defence here . Okay , that 's the only way we 're going to make it out of here . No , the only way we 're going to make it out of here is to make it to the extraction point . That 's if there is an extraction . They 'll be here ! How are we supposed to trust her , sir ? We can 't ! Brent 's right . We need to play offence against this bastard . ( Spitting ) It 's getting late . We 'll make camp here . We need to play offence against this bastard . ¶ So , now what ? Do what we do best . We wait . Come on , you son of a bitch . Come on , mother-fucker ! Come on ! ( Explosion ) Aie-aie-aie ! ( Explosion ) Sir , that 's just another terrorist . Leg 's going this way . Yeah , and his head 's going that way . He didn 't know which way he was going . This guy was dead before the explosion . They used his body to trip the mine . He 's playing us for a fool ! Yeah , I think I 'm officially freaked out . All right , reset the trap . Are you serious ? Come on , let 's get out of here ! Do I look like I 'm joking ? This thing is hunting us . Let me guess . This is bullshit ? Bingo . ¶ You think you 're going to be able to take me out that easy ? You got another think coming , puto . Come on , lead me ... through the valley of the shadow of death . This is not a bad little rig you got here . For a woman . It 's not a bad little rig you got there . For a boy . Yeah , well , whatever . Yes ? You want to see this rig ? And God made Adam ! ( Laughing ) You 're missing out ! ( Laughing ) Hey . Hey . Look , I 'm sorry what I said about your team before . Okay , they 're good guys . They 're the best . It started off as a beautiful day , huh ? Yeah . When I was stationed in Iraq , the colonel used to say all the time it was a beautiful day to die . Odd how that somehow sounds romantic . So , what was the worst you 'd ever been in ? I was in a chopper , shot down over Somalia . We were ambushed , kidnapped , and I was the only one who survived . You must be blessed . ( Laughing ) Yeah , or maybe I 'm cursed . Look , I didn 't want to scare the team before . The area was the testing ground for the E16 . Okay , I 'm listening . What 's the E16 ? It 's a covert project to create the perfect cyborg soldier . I 'm talking half-man , half-computer . This thing can withstand temperatures and terrains that no human can , equipped with weapons straight out of a comic book . They were injecting this thing with human brain cells , which ended up morphing and multiplying into an intelligence level we would never understand . Now , they 've lost control of it . Complete ! So , tell me one thing . Why 's it taking human brains ? I have no idea . Half-man , half-machine , huh ? Mmm . Well , then I guess it is a beautiful day to die . ( Explosion ) ( Gunfire ) Move , move ! ( Shouting in Spanish ) Jessie ! Ugh ! ( Gunshots ) ( Groaning ) Jessie ! All right , where 'd it go ? Where 'd it go ? I think I shot it ! Oh ! Let 's get to that chopper , come on . Where 's everybody else ? They 're dead . This is- - Argh ! ( Gunshots ) Go , go , go ! Get out of here ! ( Gunfire , screaming ) You bastard ! ( Screeching ) ( Gunshots ) I ain 't impressed ! You can 't kill me , mother-fucker ! I 'm from Philly ! Bitch ! Show time . Come on , you bastard . Come and get me , come and get me . ( Explosion ) There we go . Ha , ha , got you ! How 's it feel , buddy ? ( Gunshot ) ( Gunfire ) Oh , yeah , you 're hurting now , aren 't you , buddy ? You 're hurting now . What the hell ? Ugh ! ( Gunshots ) Argh ! ( Crashing ) It 's never easy ! ( Gunshots ) Man ! ( Explosion ) ( Explosion ) ¶ CASSANDRA : Tyler ! Tyler ! Hang in there , soldier . ¶ SENATOR : Destroyed ? Okay , send out a search team and look for survivors . Destroy all the information , and design a deniability story . You know , when I was a young boy , I would have dreams and fantasies of being there the day that Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of Independence , or Francis Scott Key , the night that he penned the Star-Spangled Banner . This is the greatest nation in the history of civilization . No secret this republic can leave this building . Because of that , I must love my country ... even when tough love is the order of the day . My only comfort is knowing right now , this second , that I did what was best for the country that I call my own . Gentlemen , from this second forward , that is all that I have . ( Gunshot ) Great work , soldier . I 'm going to put you in for a medal for this . Oh , yeah . I 'm sorry , son . That 's the way it is . I mean , that 's protocol in these types of operations . Now , you do understand that , don 't you ? And again , you did an amazing job . You know something , Colonel . I never did like cigars . Oh ! Jessie was right . This is bullshit . Hey ! Hey . So , what 's next , Lieutenant ? I 'm going to go ... meet the families of my team . And tell them the truth . You know , I was wrong about you . Thank you for coming back out there to get me . You saved my life . Anytime . Take care . Tyler ! ¶ See you around . ¶

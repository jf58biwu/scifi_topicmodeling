 THE BEAST It 's me , Bora . I was busy with a shoot . What 's up ? Grandma ? The government has confirmed its plan to dispatch 500 people , including troops and volunteers , to Afghanistan . The plan will be presented to the National Assembly this week . The civilian volunteers and the troops protecting them ... Tae-hoon ! It 's been decided , but it hasn 't been opened to the press yet . Do you know how bad it is in Afghanistan ? It 's different from what the news and the media says . The truth is completely different . It 's a battlefield over there . People are getting killed daily . But they want to send innocent people there ? I heard that they would be peacekeepers . That 's what we 'd like people to think . But our task is different . We were a good team in Iraq . Let 's do it once more . Ahn Ki-rae , deceased Our family is all here . 6 months later We 'll pass out if we keep this up . - Yeah , this is killing me . - I 'm finished . How about you ? - I 'm done , too . - Hey , everyone ! - Young-jee , we 're heading out . - What ? I just got here . Well , you should have come here on time . - Anyway , we have a shoot today . - What ? Without me ? Sorry . I 'll call you if they need more people . Hey ! Excuse me . Hello . - Bora , can you do me a favor ? - What 's that ? I 'm supposed to shoot with Young-jee on the 13th . But I had forgotten about it and scheduled something else . Will it be okay if I go ? If you go , that would be great . Okay , I 'll do it . Really ? Thank you so much . I can only count on you The weather 's so nice . Why are our pretty girls so quiet ? Ah , pass me that cell phone . My cell phone ? Yeah , I just want to see it . Is that a new model ? Come on , I 'll return it Wow , this cell phone is luxurious . What are you doing ? - Give me yours , too . - Why ? Just give it to me now . Your cell phone is so tacky . What is this ? Why are you two so surprised ? Calls are forbidden on the job . - Where are we going ? - You 'll see when you get there . Come inside . Hurry . Why are you hesitating ? Come sit and relax . - Sit down . - Let 's go . We came for a car photo shoot . - Yeah , it 's similar . - We 're leaving ! - What 's wrong with you two ? - Why are you doing this ? Sit down . Sit down . Why can 't you fucking get what I 'm saying ? Sit down now ! What 's wrong with you two ? - Sir ! - Where 's the producer ? He said he 's shooting now , and will come tomorrow . Work Contract Kang Bo-ra . Jung Young-jee . Is that right ? Excuse me ? Aren 't they your names ? I will explain briefly . Our company manages a small lnternet business . But it 's not doing well lately . I found out later that our models were the reason . So , I was offered to use models like you for more money . So I approved it . So work hard and don 't disappoint me . Also , if you don 't want to do it , you don 't have to . However , here 's the contract you signed . Read it carefully again . What kind of work do we have to do ? You didn 't know ? Young-jee ! What the hell ? Grab her ! What 's going on ? Open the door ! Hey , go get the key . Yes , sir . Please help me ! Do you want to play golf ? Don 't come any closer ! You should 've asked , but why 'd you run away ? Don 't come any closer ! Come on , swing it . Bring me the ball Now swing . Swing , you bitch ! - Swing , swing . - Don 't come any closer ! Don 't ! Dumb bitch . Don 't come ... What 's wrong with her ? What the fuck ? Is she dead ? Sir ... Young-jee ! Sit down . Stay still . I didn 't do it , sir . I will do my best . Please trust me , sir . I told you not to touch our business products . Young-jee ! Young-jee ! No ! Sir ... The screen golf program will now began . - What shall we do , sir ? - Shoot the trailer first . Then let 's think about what we 'll do next . Jung Oh-tak ? Tae-hoon . So what 's up ? Sit down . Hiding it won 't solve the problem . What 's going on ? Saturday night , 10pm A hot and dirty temptation Popular sexy model Kang Bo-ra 's episode Where are you going ? You 'll be on active duty in two days . - You can 't be temporarily relieved . - I 'm sorry , sir . What is it ? My young sister got hurt . She got hurt ? How ? - Traffic accident . - Again ? Was she badly hurt ? I 'm not sure . So there 's nothing else , right ? Do you have to go today ? Yes , sir . Don 't get into any trouble , okay ? Yes , sir . It was my fault . If I hadn 't asked Bo-ra to do that job ... No word yet from Bo-ra 's friend ? None . Her brother had called , but he said that she hadn 't called home , either So you don 't know who introduced that job to her ? No , I don 't . S-T-T-E-R-6 ... damn it . 6-9-dot-t-v ... It 's not popping up . There 's a link at the bottom . - Here ? - No , next to it . Yes , there . These bastards are very tricky Anyway , what proof do you have that your sister was kidnapped ? She 's not a minor and if she 's a sexy model ... So did you receive any call or weird text message from the suspects ? Like any ransom money or something . Something in particular ? - No . - Okay , I got it . Go home for now and wait . We 'll look into it and call you . Go and wait ? Till when ? Normally , investigations take time . We have to brief the cyber investigation team . There are some things we need to do , and also ... Anyway , you should go home and wait for your sister to call . And try contacting her friends or colleagues if you can . You don 't believe what I 'm saying ? What have you been hearing ? I have to go back tomorrow ! How dare you shout in here ? I told you that I 'd look into it . How rude ... Only after we get a threatening call can they investigate this case . She 's in danger , but they just go through the motions I have to collect information about that site . I 'm sure that someone will know . Could be the person who introduced that job to her I 've been trying to find the address , but they 've registered the company and server overseas . It 's probably in Canada or Australia . The problem is that the broadcast could be done from overseas . But I think that 's not the case here . and those bastards wouldn 't spend any time and money on this . So that means that they 're broadcasting it somewhere in Korea . This is being operated differently . The website has been registered overseas , and the actual broadcast is being done through a Korean lDC . IDC ? Internet Data Center . They receive money from an individual or company and rent out the server . Originally , this is illegal . But small lDCs have appeared and these deals have grown rampant lately . If they 're broadcasting it , then there should be a base station . We can find Bo-ra if we find the source broadcasting to the base station . That 's right . You know pretty well . But there 's a problem . What is it ? There 's a limit to tracing it on-line Only if I could find a log file ... But no matter how hard I try , I can 't . it 's not as easy as you think . On top of that , I 'm not that skilled enough . If it can 't be done on-line ... Then off-line . Off-line ? - Will you be okay ? - What ? Yeah ... Thanks . - Sae-yeun , from this point on ... - I know . Don 't worry about me . - Then I 'll be right back . - Be careful . May I help you ? Yes , the server I rented has a problem . I 'm sorry , but can we have it checked ? - Did you call ? - No , we 're in a rush . What company are you from ? Sister69-TV . Come inside . You can 't go in there . It 's this way . I said it 's this way ! Who the hell are you ? What 's your problem ? Don 't worry . He won 't die . This is it ! - Did you find it ? - Yeah , this is it . How long will it take ? I don 't know . It 'll take some time . - We can 't just wait here . - Then what can we do ? Wait , hold on . I think we found it . The link is cut off . Let 's go . What 's this ? - Go down the emergency stairs . - What about you ? I 'll be right behind you . Who are you ? Sae-yeun ! Go ! - Where shall I go ? - Go to my company first . Take a right at the intersection . My cell phone is in the car . I 'll call you . Okay , thank you . Don 't worry . We can find her , right ? We 'll find her no matter what . I still can 't believe it . How could this have happened ? Why does he have so much stuff in there ? You 're right . Hello ? - Tae-hoon , it 's me . - Yeah . Where ? Okay , thanks . What did he say ? - That trailer ... - Trailer ? You mean , Bo-ra ? He found where it was first uploaded . - Really ? Where ? - Susek district . Something 's wrong with the lnternet I can 't get in the site . It 's me . There 's a problem with the server . What ? Damn it . Fix it within an hour . Go do your job . Right , of course . I 'll get things ready . What 's his damn problem ? Where did he go ? I 'm busy as hell . Where does he always go ? When can we start , damn it ? Let 's see . Don 't smoke . The guy actors don 't like it . I can just brush my teeth . You 're going to smoke again anyway . Go away . - Pull it down . - Why ? Just listen to me . Cherry , what 's wrong with you ? You think that 's a pro 's nipple ? Go get some ice and make it hard before the shoot . What the hell is that ? Is that the attitude to have for this work of art ? Whatever . I just need to fuck great . Fuck ? Fuck ? How many times did I tell you not to say that ? Just because I do this work don 't look down on me . I studied in Paris , you know . French movies ! Nouvelle vague ! Don 't you know ? This isn 't about fucking . This is one of the genres of art . The art of pornography , okay ? You don 't know a thing . This isn 't fucking ! It 's art ! Pornography ! Not fucking . A fuck is a fuck . This is bullshit . Shooting your mouth isn 't art . This is a wood stick , you idiot . Get it right . Fuck . Nice shot ! Hey , asshole . Don 't say ' nice shot - Good shot . - Stop it , asshole . You have a call , sir . Hey , Jae-kyu ! There are some guys on your tail . What ? Okay . Fuck .

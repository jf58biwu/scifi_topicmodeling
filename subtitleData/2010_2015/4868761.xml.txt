 Fringe ... When we were in jacksonville , There was a pie chart with names . Yeah , all the kids from walter and bell 's trials . I made a list . Nick lane and james heath . They were both part of walter 's tests . Of all the children that walter and I have prepared , You are the strongest . The storm is coming , and when it is over , I fear there will be little left of our world . I 'm not from here , am I ? You didn 't just open up a hole to the other side . You brought me back . That 's why I can 't remember my childhood . You were dying . That 's why my mother committed suicide . She knew . Walter , peter checked himself out of the hospital Three hours ago . He 's gone . Hello , son . anomalous energy signature detected . Local-brooklyn . Confirmed - we 've got a breach . Oh , I was thinking , " hey , Maybe a slow day , it being Saturday and all . " No rest for the wicked . Oh , you 're not wicked , charlie . You just pretend really , really well . Somebody playing my song ? class one event , sir . I can see that . You ? Yes , I can . Clear as day . okay , people , nap time 's over . Let 's go to work . So exactly how big would the worms get If you stopped dosing yourself ? They 're not worms . they 're arachnids . sit rep as follows . Class-one molecular dissolution . Numbers show severe molecular cohesion failure . This isn 't just a little tear . We got a full-fledged hole here , people . Has anything come through it ? No data yet . On site in less than 60 seconds . Long as it 's not bugs . Oh , it 's probably bugs . What ? Bugs like you . on my six ! I want science and risk reports in three minutes . Site 's secure , boss . Chief , this is bad . I 'm showing stage-three degradation . I need data that tells me this event is contained , Captain . I 'm trying here . Damn it . We 're in potential quarantine range here , sir . Send up a looker , stat . the looker 's being dispatched now , sir . Hi . I 'm agent dunham with fringe division . Could I see your show-me , please ? Sure . You ain 't gonna quarantine the place , right ? There 's nothing to worry about . But if you could tell me what you saw - I mean , even small things could be important . I 'm getting decreased gravity measurements here , colonel . Activating quarantine potentiator . Agent farnsworth ? Broyles . Phillip . Colonel . Risk assessment . I need to know if this thing is spreading . We can 't have another boston , captain . I know tha You think I don 't know that ? quarantine device unlocked . Recommendation , agent . quarantine will result in excess Of 10,000 casualties . warning . One minute to quarantine . Massive loss of life will result . Warning ... Recommendation , agent . Gravitational and molecular degeneration are decreasing , But outside acceptable parameters . Recommendation , agent farnsworth ? Calculating . massive loss of life will result . Really ? 40 seconds to quarantine . Quarantine device unlocked . God , and I didn 't even update my will . Massive loss of life will result . Frank would just spent it all anyway . 30 seconds to quarantine . Recommendation , agent farnsworth ? Event is terminating - no quarantine recommended . Captain , you are clear . Do not quarantine . Repeat - do not quarantine . 20 seconds to quarantine . We got to stop doing this . Warning ... hey , guys . We got something up here . I wish it was bugs . what is that ? these look like carcinomas . There 's no way anyone could live long enough To develop tumors this severe . Witnesses have anything ? The usual-I mean , they heard a tearing sound . They saw a blue flash through the window . I gave them chips so they could get radiation scans . See if he has any I.D. Guy may have had a wife and kids Before the universe sucked him up and spat him out . Poor guy . That 's not a show-me . Okay . Check this out . Who the hell is jackson ? olivia . Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Come on , everyone . Keep down . Come on . Come on . I can take you back where you belong , son . They have our coordinates . But if you come with me , You won 't be able to come back here . You have to make a choice , peter . let 's go . Thanks . Hello ? Hello , agent dunham . There-there is something I am supposed to remember , And I can 'remember what it is , but it 's about peter . Walter ... No , no , no ! I think something is going to happen to him , Something ... Something terrible . I think this is what I 'm supposed to remeer . Okay . Well , one of those men - you know , the observers - I think he left it for me . Well , after I brought peter from the other side , Some years later , one of them came to visit me . Well-well , he told me that I had to agree Toever let peter return to e other de . Why ? Because if I did , this wou happen . Okay , but what is this , walter ? What does it even mean ? Look , look , it is exactly what it appes to be . See ? I think my s ... Is going to be responsible for the end of t world . Okaylter , we have get peter back . He went off by his own free will . But he didn 't know about this . Even if he wand - walter , how do we get him back ? We have no way of contacting - walter ! How ? m sorry , sir , I can 't let you go in the . This is - don 't even think about it ! What is this , phillip ? We have reason To believe your company Is manufacturing weapons for the other side . Oh , that absurd . I want every piece of data Even remotely related to the other universe . W dare you ? Are you out of your mind ? Stop it , both of you ! Per is in danger . Walter says that this technology Has a very specic And recognizable design . I dare say nina would agree . Dear g . What side is this ? Does it matter ? This is william 's technology , but we didn 't build it . Okay , nina , listen to me . Peter 's been taken . You have to help us cross over . the thing is , Get over the , That 'suh , really a misnomer . In truth , the two universes are overpping . And to get to the other side , Our universe Needs to pass through you , literally , Like-like water passing through a cheesecloth . Our cells need to separate on an atomic level . The problem is , when they come back together , They don 't come back together with the same cohesion . Somehow , bell managed to cross back and forth , Although precisely how , We can find no record of . But I suspect that whatever methodology , He crossed so many times That he 's become Like this coffee cup - Molecularly unstable . As many atoms in each of us As there are stars in the sky . It 's why belly never came back , isn 't it ? Because he was scared that the same thing Would happen to him . I don 't know . I 've sent him communications , but if he got them , He hasn 't been able to communicate to me . there has to be a way . What about how you crossed over when you first got peter ? The last time I opened a door , It set in motion the ripples that weaken the very fabric Of our reality . To do so again could instantly shatter Both worlds ... And likely would . Brandon , give us a moment . You know , unlike william , You have the ability to cross over safely . I can 't . I-I-I mean , I - I-I can 't control it . I 've-I 've flashed over for a few seconds , Or bell 's pulled me over , but I-I-I can 't control it , Not on my own . Not on your own , But if there were two or three of you , A - a-a larger power supy , as iwere . I 'm not following . With more cortexiphan children , Their collective psychic ergy Could ... You know , belly and I always agreed That that primal part of the brain Which allows us to cross universes Is also responsible For a host of - of paranormal activities - Pyrokinesis , telepathy , thought control . And that we all had these abilities Until-till there was a moment in history When something was done to us , and-and it was shut down . I suspect aliens . Unfortunately , The only other Cortexiphan children that we have located , They have failed worse . You ... Are the only one left . Actually ... She 's not . Performance without compromise . Unaccounted for . Prudence dictated we determine What we might be dealing with in the future . So you woke all three of them up ? Actually , five . We 've tracked down some others . Okay . About six weeks ago , Massive dynamic proposed A series of experiments To help them gain control of and repurpose their abilities . These three have been quite successful . James heath can now cure disease , Not cause it . Sally clark is becoming a fully functional pyrokinetic . And your friend nick lane 's empathic transfers Can now be controlled . Olive . Nick . Very good , baby . Welcome to the monkey house . This is new . Who authorized it ? Senate intelligence ... Thanks to peter . It was part of a list of demands he gave me Right before I went to secure our funding . This is very mission : Impossible . I know you . You 're the man That experimented on us . I could kill you where you stand . Each of you could . What I did ... Was inexcusable ... Barbaric . The collateral damage Has been extensive . But know that we had noble goals . We believed That our world needed guardians , Protectors , That you children would be those protectors . We fostered your talents because we foresaw That the day would come When both universes would be in jeopardy . So ... Horrible as it is to say , Today is the day For which you were created . What I could never have imagined Is that I would be asking you To help me save son . I 'm so sorry . Well , ifone of you are gonna kill me ... I think I 'll go and have a bit of a cry . Man , that 's not the same guy I remember . He 's exactly the same . Dr. Bishop has identified a likely spot To attempt a crossover - brooklyn , new york . You go at 0800 tomorrow morning . You might want to get some rest . hey , fbi guy . We 're about to go save the world , right ? Two worlds even . can 't we have a night off ? Whatever they want . Who are you ? I was never lucky , you know ? Sometimes people need some good luck . Tonight I guess that 's me . Who else do we have ? * * Sweet . Hmm . Me or the strawberry ? Both . So what would you like this time - To feel what I 'm feeling or what you 're feeling ? Both . Please , god ... Aunt liv , what time is it ? It 's early . I have to go on a trip , and , uh ... I wanted to give you something before left . It 's pretty . My mother ... Your grandmother ... Gave it to me before she died . She told me that it would keep me safe . So now I 'm giving it to you . Thanks , aunt liv . You are welcome , baby girl . You 're up early . I didn 't even hear you come in last night . No , I 've been working a case . Think you 'll be home for dinner ? I hope so . I 'll call you and let you know . Okay . Hey , you okay ? Yeah . We should do this more often . It 's nice . Sure . Look what aunt live gave me . ( broyles even assuming this works - ( broyles even assuming this works - That you make it to the other side , You still have no idea how you 're going to locate peter . no , but I spoke to nina sharp , And she sent a message to william bell Asking him to meet us at the grayshot bridge In central park at 4 : 00 p . M. I think he 'll help us find peter . Dunham ... Massive dynamic didn 't make that weapon over here . That means bell may have made it on the other side for them . No . I trust him . In any case , nina has no confirmation That bell even gets her messages . No . In which case , You 're essentially invading enemy territory Without a plan . You don 't know anything about the opposition , The landscape ... oh , we 're ready . We 're ready to try this . you can 't tell me you think this is a good idea . No . I don 't think that this is a good idea . Do you got a better one ? it was lovely , wasn 't it ? Now ... Faded and broken just like me . So how does this work , walter ? Remember your shakespeare , dear . " all the world is a stage " ... Or in this case , both worlds . You will form a circle . I - I will stand in the middle , And I will lead you across . No . You can 't do this . Oh , no . No . He is my son , olivia . You can 't do this . I won 't allow it . I believe I can . Or-or else they cannot . I can 't ask them to do something That I-I 'm not willing to chance myself . Thank you . Well , if any of you have chang your minds , I will understd . We were talking about it on the way over here . Maybe you did damage us . But on the other hand , maybe you made us special . Fate is a tricky thing . So , um ... You-you would want to take a few steps back , I think , agent broyles . Olivia . Now , I want you to clear your minds And-and just relax . All right ? Now , ignore everything Except the sound of my voice . Now ... Sp-spread out your arms . You remember how . Spread them out to each other . Yes . Good . Now , I want you to think back To when you were just young children , Back to when you were just young boys and girls . Think back to when your imagination Could-could take you wherever you wanted to go . Imagine this universe slipping away , Opening like a curtain . Allow the universe to pass right through you . Allow your imagination To take you to the other side . james . James . help me . Walter , what do we do ? Look ... We made it . okay , come on , james . You 've got to get up . We 've got to hide now . Nick ... Nick , I don 't feel so good . Over here . Come on . I want science and risk reports in three minutes . nick . Nick , make them leave . I 've been trying . It 's not working . What 's wrong with us ? I don 't know . Nick , I 'm scared . Check this out . Who the hell is jackson ? Got a junior ? Yeah . Going to a strip club later ? Someone 's got to visit your sister . The paper 's real . The detail is amazing . Why would someone go to this kind of trouble ? what in god 's name Did you all find ? Nothing useful . Dead end so far . Well , whatever it is you scanned Just raised a red flag over at the d . O.D. The secretary wants to see you . hey , charlie , you ever met him ? I shook his hand once when I graduated the academy . What about you ? My dad knew him . Oh , that explains so much . Yeah , you don 't want to leak worms all over the guy . Makes a bad first impression . They 're not worms . He 's waiting for you . Go ahead in . Mr. Secretary . Thank you . Agent lee ... I 'm sorry about your father . He was a good man . Fine jurist . Thank you , sir . And this is your team ? Yes , sir . Agents francis and dunham . Sir . I understand you 're investigating A fringe event in brooklyn . That 's correct , sir . And in this event , There was a casualty-a man ? That 's correct , sir . So far , we haven 't been able to - Agent , I believe that I may have insight Into who that man is and where he was from . What I 'm about to tell you Is classified . But I think it 's time you knew what you were dealing with . Agent dunham , what can you tell me About the fringe division ? Okay , I ' play . Uh ... The fringe division is a special adjunct branch Of the department of defense . It 's primary focus are natural and environmental disasters That began in 1985 With the zero event at reiden lake . And what are these natural disasters ? They 're holes in the fabric of the universe , sir . A - plus . And how do you know all this ? I know it because I read it in the zft in 1995 When you wrote and published it . the zft . The natural decay Of our world . What would you say if I told you That the zft is a lie Or a half-truth anyway ? These tears are not natural . They are the work of man . These holes Don 't simply lead to nothing . There is something On the other side . What ? Another one . Bravo . Another what ? Another universe ... A parallel earth just like this , But slightly different . And it was their attempt To penetrate our world which created The pattern of destruction that we struggle with daily . The $ 20 bill was - From the other side , and so was he . And I suspect he didn 't come alone . As you know , I am not a lover of war . But I have reason to believe that these invaders Are anything but peaceful . They must be found , And they must be found quickly . We 'll get them , sir . Streaming on a single screen . I 'm burning up , nick . It 'll be fine , baby . Come on . Scan your I.D. , lady . Sorry . Uh , we 're gonna have to walk . Central park is 59th street - that 's three miles from here . Okay , then we better get started . Hi . How are you feeling ? I 'm okay . You 've been asleep for three days . Your fa - Walter said you might feel a bit dizzy . Maybe you 'd like to sit down . I 'm okay . You must be starving . I made some eggs and bacon . Do-do you still like bacon ? When you were a boy , we - I love bacon . Oh , peter . Oh , I 've missed you so much . Oh . Stop for a second . It 's fine . I 'm fine . Let 's go . You 've got to know something . What the hell is wrong with us ? Oh , I suspect that somehow the human circuit was flawed . Did any of you engage in extreme use of your abilities Last night - far more than normal ? No . Perhaps poor mr . Heath - You 've got to help her . I can 't . But if we 're lucky , Perhaps william bell can . It 's the grand hotel . They never built it . Things that might have been in our world , but weren 't . Come on . It 's not far . Okay . coffee 's quite hard to come by over here . It 's been rationed for some time now . But walter 's very well connected . It 's funny , I .. I never had bacon when I was growing up . My mother was vegetarian , so she never made it . Until today , I always thought I imagined having it as a kid . I 'm sorry ... My mother from the other side . I 'm sure you don 't want to hear about that . No , on the contrary . I want to hear all about your childhood . What 's - Are you close with her still ? I mean ... Did she take good care of you ? She took very good care of me . But she committed suicide about ten years ago . My mother from the other side - She was wonderful , but she wasn 't strong . In fact , she was very , very sad ... Which I suppose is because of me . No , listen . Peter , in the end , We have to take responsibility For our own decisions - the good and the bad . Your father 's going to be so pleased to see you . He had said he wanted me to help him with something . Yes , he 's staying in the city tonight . But he asked me to give you this . Oh , god . Look , nick . These were my favorite . Can I get one ? I don 't think so , baby . We got to go . I - I like it here . Maybe - maybe we can stay . nick ... I 'm gonna stay . I know , baby . I know . Come on , let 's go . do you see him - william bell ? No . There 's a water fountain . Come on , I think it 'll help . Are we late ? Maybe he didn 't get the message . No . Bell has betrayed us . Run , run , run ! Oh ! don 't move ! Walter . Walter ! Nick ? I think I 'm staying here . You stay . We 'll stay together . Look , I don 't want to hurt you . Step away . Screw you . Hey ! man down . Med team to grayshot bridge . Man down . Lincoln ? Liv . Hey . Where 's the ambulance ? Dizzy ... Must be the onset of hemorrhagic shock . But I 'm still walking , So the bullet couldn 't have hit my spinal column . I 'll be perfectly fine . Excuse me . Do you really understand all these ? Maybe . I 'm not sure yet . Good night , peter . Good night . Hey . Oh . Mm . I tried to wait up . Oh , hi , baby . How is he ? Well , he 's got third-degree burns over 90 % of his body . He 's gonna need three months In a nanite regeneration chamber , But he 'll live . I 'm sorry - and on your last night . I 'm going for a week , not until the end of time . Yeah . Details . Might be a good day to start drinking . Oh , god . I would if I could only stand the taste . So what happened out there ? Just a ... A small anomaly that set off a fuel cell . It was just bad luck of the draw is all . Come on , no more work . I know what you need . yeah ? What 's that ? Back rub . Oh , you are a god . I 'll get the oil . Really ? On your last night ? Oh . I 'll take it . Mm . Hello , olivia . It 's good to see you again . How-how did you know that I - I suspected You would come here . Okay , so where were you at the park ? I received nina 's message , But when I got to the park , it was too late . There was nothing I could do . My dear olivia , I know you have good reason Not to trust me . But I 'm afraid you 're going to have to . Walter is in trouble . And I 'm quite confident We don 't have much time .

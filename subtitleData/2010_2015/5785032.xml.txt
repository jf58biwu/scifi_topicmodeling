Happy hour on the lido deck at 1600 . Is there a magic show ? Uh , Ava , leave us now , please . Is my father with you ? Dr. Tophet ? No , he 's not . But he 's alive ... and safe on my ship . He tried very hard to be here himself , and he wanted me to tell you he loves you very much . Ava , hurry along now , please . That voice ... you must recognize it . It was Kelly - - who pulled the wool over your eyes back in Cuba pretending so well to be British Commanding Officer . Excellent liars , the whole family . - That 's enough ! - Oh , see how she treats me ? I could have killed her or fed her to my crew . Instead , I lavish her with the treasures of the world . My own Executive Officer Asmik gave up his stateroom for her and her insolent daughter . But nothing is good enough . Where are my manners ? Please , sit . I 'd like to treat you with the respect your rank affords , but you are going to have to meet me halfway . Now , tell me of Dr. Scott 's Progress with the vaccine . She 's close , right ? My name is Thomas Chandler , Commander , United States navy , Serial number 4242022634 . There is no need for that . The Geneva Convention doesn 't exist anymore . Hell , Geneva doesn 't exist anymore ! Still won 't talk ? See , I told you . He would rather go it alone and die than share in the glory of saving the world . Why else would you , the ship 's Captain , personally lead the mission to save some poor island girl ? Like with all tragic heroes , your hubris brought about your downfall . What do you have to say to that , Commander Chandler ? My name is Thomas Chandler , Commander , United States navy , Serial number 4242022634 . Cobra 1-5 on final approach . Secure down and lock . Cobra 1-5 ... Helos have crisscrossed 100 square miles of ocean . No sign of him . I don 't know what I 'm hoping for - - Whether they 're still somehow out there fighting for their lives , or the Russians did get them . Any sign of the Vyerni ? Sir , nothing on the SLQ-32 . Zero electronic emissions . They 're most likely radio silent . Maybe . But they 're close . How do you know ? Because if they have the C.O. , they 're gonna call , try to make a trade - - Tex and the C.O. for Dr. Scott and her work . So what you can see here is the virus attaching to receptors in a healthy human cell . Once attached , it invades and completely destroys its host before moving on to the next cell . This is what happens to everyone in the world who contracts the virus . And death comes quickly ... As you have seen . Yes . Now , here , once again , the virus is on the attack , but this time , the receptors to which it attaches are free-floating , not part of a healthy cell . So it simply flushes out the system without causing any infection . And that ... is you , Bertrise . Those are your receptors , which I have injected into our primate friend over there . And if it can fool the virus inside him ... You 'll have a vaccine ? I was always so sick as a kid . Everyone used to tease me that I was pretending so I wouldn 't have to go to school . And now here I am . Immune to the most deadly virus in the world and possibly its savior . Uh , Bertrise , I would like to introduce you to ... Will Mason . He 's the one who heard your call on the radio . It 's very nice to meet you . I 'm so glad that you 're all right . Thank you for helping to find me . Is there any word on ... Captain Chandler or Tex ? No , ma 'am . But we 'll get them back . Somehow . Sir , Admiral Ruskov on the H.F. This is Commander Slattery . Commander . I won 't waste time . Obviously , I want Dr. Scott . Anything short of her delivery , along with all relevant samples and work , will result in the death of your captain and his companion . Are you still there , sir ? Of course you are . You just don 't know what to say . I understand . You 've never been in command before . I need proof of life . Let me talk to my commanding officer . I 'm here , X.O. You have 10 minutes to decide . What guarantees can you give me ? Just one - - If you don 't comply with my demands , I will not only torture and kill your friends , I will annihilate your ship and every soul on board . I possess enough nuclear warheads to boil the seas in which you pathetically sail . 10 minutes . Combat , this is the X.O. Tell me you got a bearing on that call . My god . Well , aren 't you the lucky one ? We break ' em out , soft-kill the engines , and haul ass to the extract point at the back of the Vyerni . That ship 's twice our size . If the alarms sound while you 're going door-to-door looking for the C.O. , it 's gonna be four of you - against 300 angry Russians . - It 's doable , sir . Who 's team leader ? You ? I wouldn 't volunteer unless I were fit , sir . Even at 80 % , he 's good to go , sir . Honestly , doctor , now is not the time . The Russians are calling back in less than five . I have the vaccine ! The monkey survived . The last damn monkey . Are you saying you have the vaccine ? A vaccine that works ? Well , in an ideal world , I 'd ... do more testing , but ... yes . Which means Ruskov doesn 't need me anymore . You can send him a dose in exchange for Tex and the Captain . Ruskov won 't just take your word for it . He 'll want to make sure . Well , then I 'll show him myself . I 'm no longer essential on this ship . From here on in , it 's merely a case of aass-producing the vaccine from my original formula . - But , doctor- - - I can show Doc Rios everything he needs to know . And if extra help is required , I 'm sure you can strike a bargain with Quincy . I can 't let you go . Ruskov asked for me . And I won 't do a thing for him until he releases Tex and the Captain . Ma 'am , you don 't realize what you 're signing up for . You would be Ruskov 's slave for life , or until he decides to kill you . Look , we all know he 'll chase us to the ends of the earth . This is the only way to stop him once and for all . Coming forward now . Give to me hands . You 've looked better . Oh , you should have seen the other guy . There was only one ? He was a big unit . No sense of humor . You want to know the kicker ? He didn 't even ask me any questions . Hey ! No talk , or I kiss your ass ! You mean kick my ass ! Just shut up your head , okay ? I spoke to our friend from Chicago . If I know Mike , he 's planning on paying us a visit . We 'd better find a way to make him feel welcome . Kirov class battleships run on a C.O.N.A.S. system . That 's combined nuclear and steam propulsion . Not gonna be able to take out both boilers , so if you want to kill her , gotta damage the shaft . Engines can spin all day , but the props won 't turn . Not gonna be able to burn through them with the incendiaries I 'm carrying . There 's a soft spot you 're gonna have to find . But you 're gonna have to be careful , sir . There could be a meltdown if you use too many explosives . Yeah , and we 're all dead and we lose the C.O. - Right . - Which is why you 're coming with . Like I said before , you 're part of my team . You ready to bring it ? Hell , yeah , sir . Let 's map this out . This is a .45 caliber pistol . Excellent knock-down power , but the trade-off is that it 's large and heavy . It 's a got an 8-round magazine , loaded . And I 'm gonna give you an extra . Let 's hope you won 't need it . And lastly , the suppressor . It 's highly effective . Without it , you 'll wake up the entire ship . But you need time to attach it . Are we clear ? - Crystal . - Outstanding . Thank you . If anything should happen ... finish what we started . The Russians are picking you up in one of their helos out in the middle of nowhere , taking you to their ship . - We won 't have any contact after that . - I understand . It 's a little late to ask if you really want to do this . Let me just say , what you 're doing is ... very brave . I 'm proud to know you . You 're making it sound like good-bye . I 'll see you for breakfast . How about , uh , " Great Escape " ? Kinda hard to tunnel out of a ship . Yeah , you got a point there . You ever see " Papillon " ? Are we just doing Steve McQueen flicks ? What about " Escape From Alcatraz " ? You 'd need a dummy . What about , uh , bad english over there ? What are you talking of ? ! Quiet ! Take off . Turn around . Good . Virus samples . Okay , careful . Come . Tracking device moving at a steady 15 knots , sir . Looks like we 're aboard the Vyerni . Extraction teams underway . We got you now , you son of a bitch . Dr. Scott . How long I 've waited to welcome you aboard Vyerni . I won 't be talking further or doing any kind of work until you bring up your prisoners . Of course . It was expected . What the hell are you doing here ? Now I understand why the good doctor agreed to pay us a visit . The deal was me for them . You gave your word that you 'd let them go . Not until I confirm that you 've delivered what I 've requested . Well , I assume you have a lab . Dr. Scott . So nice to see you again . Do I know you ? European congress of virology , 2011 . Uh , you spoke on techniques for hemagglutination-inhibition with arthropod-borne viruses . And afterwards , I introduced myself , shook hands . Niels Sorensen . I 'm sorry . I don 't recall . I was with Professor Lindblom . I remember Jonas . You were in his department ? Um ... for a time . Uh , he ... never really saw clearly what I was trying to , uh ... anyways ... I 'd invite you in , but it 's such a mess . Uh , actually , they are , uh , supposed to clean up every day . And I tell them that the U.V. light kills the virus , but , um ... You 're infected . Uh , not exactly . But you 're not even symptomatic . Perhaps I should explain . It was you . You added the human gene . Yes . You weaponized the virus ! What ? No . No , I didn 't weaponize it . I was really close to a major breakthrough . I added my gene to the virus and then injected it back into my bloodstream , and it worked . I am completely immune . I just - - Uh , I didn 't know that I also made myself a carrier . So you 're patient zero ? No , I didn 't start it . I 'm trying to find a solution here . I 'm trying to fix it , and I can fix it as soon as I get the primordial strain . - If that - - - You don 't understand what you 've done . The primordial won 't work now . The virus that you created , the modifications you made - - you 've made it so much worse . And you could have come forward at any point . I mean , you must have known this . No , that was too late . There was zero benefit from me coming forward at that point - - You killed four billion people . I didn 't - - and you never gave them a chance to understand how it happened ? But I can now . I mean , can solve it now . It 's too late . I 've already done it . I already made the vaccine . - That 's a lie ! - See for yourself . Hey , that - - no . You 're not allowed to do that , actually . - That 's mine ! That 's mine ! - I would like to speak with the admiral , please . No ! She doesn 't go anywhere ! Unh ! You don 't get to do it without me . Did you really think that your D.N.A. could save the human race ? Dr. Scott ... Unbelievable . I mean , I can 't believe she kissed you . You 're a married man , for Pete 's sake . And you 're navy . Did you not get the talk ? No fraternization with the ladies , buddy . " Ladder room . Port side , 0400 . " You know where that is ? I have an idea . First we gotta get by this guy . And there 're two guards on the p-way . Goddamn it . He had to send her . Right ? I mean , I 'm standing right there . She could have easily passed me the note . Tex ... 0400 . Got it . You lied to me ! I took you in because you told me She was not capable of succeeding without you . Now I find you 've wasted my time and resources . Do you really think I 've kept myself in here for nothing ? I 'm telling you , Admiral , her vaccine won 't work . You still need me . That 's right . I do . Dr. Scott . Now we test the vaccine . What are you waiting for ? Do it . Standing by . Outstanding . Let 's hope she got him that note . Comfortable ? As I boy , I shared a room not much larger than this With my five brothers and sisters . My parents were not among the political elite . We grew familiar with tight quarters , with cold , with hunger . Oh , that 's a real sob story . Well told . Aren 't they expecting you back in Transylvania before sunrise ? This vaccine your Dr. Scott has developed is now the single greatest commodity in the world . Every day its value increases , as those not yet infected grow desperate for it . And it 's mine ! The American dream . Isn 't that the expression ? Think it got lost in the translation . Once I have successfully tested the vaccine , I will most likely kill all of you and destroy your ship . But ... perhaps there 's another way - - A way that can help your shipmates , your friends , your families . You have courage , first-rate ship , a crew that will follow you wherever you say . I think we can work well together . Achieve a great deal together . My name is Thomas Chandler , Commander , United States navy , Serial number 4242022634 . Was a good talk , Boris . If there 's nothing else ... Well , we 'd like to get some shut-eye . 10 minutes , sir . Master chief , how you feeling ? Scared to death , sir . Well , you 're not alone , I 'm sure . No , sir . I am not . Yeah . This is your X.O. So ... Two sailors walk into a bar . And they both walk out . We will get our men back . We will get our captain back . That is all . Maneuver the ship into position to pick up the extract team . Aye , sir . Thought I 'd open with a joke . It was a good one , sir . Now you can kiss my ass . I don 't wish to ruin the ending for you , but your vaccine will not work . Isn 't that right , Dmitri ? You 're not feeling so good , huh ? The virus already has you in its clutches . The cavalry has arrived . You okay , sir ? I 'm fine . This your idea , Burk ? Can 't take all the credit , but I 'm happy to be here , sir . Yeah . We 'll talk about this later . Where 's Dr. Scott ? The lab should be one level down , back aft . We 'll pick her up on the way to the extract point , off the flight deck . Let 's move . Like clockwork . Stingray , this is tiger shark . Rally point one is a go . Package in hand . - Moving to rally point two . How copy ? - Copy that . No , sir , lab is - - Sir , lab is this way . Captain , this is officer country . Sir ? Sir ? Sir , what are you looking for ? Asmik . You want off this ship , come with me right now . Cossetti , Cruz , I want you to escort Mrs. Tophet - and her daughter to the extraction point . - Yes , sir . Rest of you , with me . We 're going to get Dr. Scott . Clear ! You come with me ... now . But I still need to give him the second part of his vaccine . Admiral wants you . You must come with me now . But if we leave the room and the vaccine test fails , Ruskov will kill both me and you . Do it . Quick . No ! Hey , hey ... Pierce the plastic , everyone on this ship dies - - you first . I helped you ! Ma 'am , it 's us . Drop your weapon . Doctor , put the weapon down ! I 'll be damned . Dolphin , this is tiger shark . Rally point two is a go . Shut her down . Here we go . Move it out . Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . I can almost smell the sea air . I knew we 'd make a sailor out of you . Stingray , this is tiger shark . Are you in position ? That 's affirmative . Hang on . There 's no way they haven 't checked our cells yet . Sir ? No alarms . Not one call over the 1MC , nothing over the radios ? They 're waiting for us on the other side of that hatch . The stern is blown . We need a new way off this ship now . Stingray , tiger shark . Primary extract is blown . I repeat - - Oscar is no good . Very clever , commander . They are here . This way ! They 're here . Let 's go . Let 's go , let 's go ! Stay right there . This way , ma 'am . Come on , come on , come on . - Darling , be brave . - Mom ! Stand there . Stand - - stand there . The ladder ... Get through . It 's okay . Come with me . Get down ! Stay down . Stay down ! Clear ! Got visual . Contact ! Danny , do it ! You rocked it , man ! You really rocked it ! We did it , sir . We did it . Cossetti ! Cossetti ! Talk to me , buddy , talk to me ! He 's been hit ! Cossetti , come on ! Stay with me ! Come in . Daddy !

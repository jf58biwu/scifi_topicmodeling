 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... My older brother , Christian , he didn 't beat up my younger brother . He was crueler than that . He made me do it . Throw him the rope , and I 'll throw you in there , too . Why isn 't there a nationwide manhunt ? He escaped from federal custody . Just wanted to make sure you got my present . I promised him a face-to-face with Coulson . I hear you 've been looking for this . The Obelisk . We share a common enemy . Guy named Phil Coulson . Everything we 've been doing , it all leads here . It 's a city . Our job , find it before anyone else . Beautiful , is it not ? Your group was digging in the ground at night . How you found it is a mystery . Do tell us . We 've heard the same stories as you . Well , we 've both searched so long for a thing we barely understand . You can hold it if you like . Please . Hmm ... Worked quickly on this one . So gender 's not a factor , nor race . No pattern emerges . Fascinating . Put him with the others . Then bring the next subject . Please , have a seat . Do not be afraid . Feel free to pick it up , examine it . Please . Discovery requires experimentation . Remarkable . What makes you so special ? I think it wise we prepare her for surgery . We must examine exactly what makes her tick . Herr Doktor Reinhardt . Red Skull has fallen ! He 's dead . The Allies approach . The world has lost a great mind . Put her in a cage . We 'll unravel this mystery later , yes ? Discovery requires experimentation . And this experiment will take time . With all of modern science and millions of dollars at your disposal , these are your results ? I 've had this information for decades . Bring him in . It 's time to prove your claim that you 're an expert on this Diviner . And could 've saved you weeks of work . Instead you kept scratching and pawing at it like a monkey , expecting new results . The very definition of insanity ... Mr. Bakshi 's disappearance has everyone on edge . These men will remain in case your temper returns . Not necessary , I assure you . Cool as a cucumber . Smart to play it safe . Tell me what you do know , sir . And I 'll fill in the blanks . I know that a special few can touch it without suffering . But I have yet to figure out how this weapon can be ... Weapon ? That 's so small-minded . Uh , for someone with such a big mind . It 's a key . It can kill , sure . But only to protect itself from those it doesn 't " divine , " hence the catchy name , to be worthy . I 'm interested in science , Doctor . Not folklore . Worthy of unlocking its true power . Oh , I got your attention . There 's a place ... And if one of those special people you speak of takes this Diviner to that special place ? It won 't just kill . It will do something , scientifically speaking , much , much cooler . I 'm unclear on how I 'm stuck running the base and you 're off to Hawaii . Don 't get too jealous . I doubt I 'll even see the tarmac . There 's plenty of work to be done . Ward 's still out there . Have you gotten a response from his brother ? He has his own men on the manhunt . We 're politically toxic , and he demanded that we stay away from the case . They 'll never find him . I 'll signal a few assets to be on alert . How 's Agent Morse handling Bakshi ? He wouldn 't speak for the first eight hours . But she 's working him . I 'll send you any developments . Aloha . Didn 't wanna crack him yourself ? Bobbi 's as good as they come . My job now is to keep an eye on the big picture . And you 've found something to chase . Fury . I 've been thinking a lot about what made him such a good director . His communication skills ? Flawed . But he could always see five steps ahead . Which , for a one-eyed man , is impressive . He knew his enemies . And for better or worse , he could think like them . Whitehall has a weapon that 's unpredictable . But he 's not . I don 't wanna be in a footrace to stop him . I wanna be waiting at the finish line . Which is the city . That 's where I believe the Obelisk will lead HYDRA . We grow stronger every day , while S.H.I.E.L.D. clings desperately to a world it no longer understands . We will rip it from your hands . I 've read the HYDRA pamphlet . Didn 't your mother ever teach you , if you 're gonna talk , say something . I could go back to being silent . Well , might as well if you have no thoughts of your own . I don 't understand how you can work for someone so ... Call him evil all you want . No . I was gonna say boring . She 's chipping away at him . It 's nice to watch someone else suffer for a change . You talk to anybody about what happened last week ? A lot happens every week , mate . No , with the Director . You didn 't see what I saw . The guy was violent . He seems all right to me . No , no . He was out of his mind , man . And they 're saying it 's ' cause Fury messed with his head or something . And , I don 't know ... Come to join the festivities ? Mr. Bakshi almost killed me a few times . Well , pull up a seat . I 'm surprised she 's so civil . You wanna see his head bashed in ? That would be wrong , wouldn 't it ? But I could never sit across from him like that . Smiling ... Bobbi can pretend to like anything . How can you follow Whitehall ? He 's sort of a milquetoasty middle-management type . Now you , you 've got that whole classic Bond villain thing going on . Why not lead ? My time will come . Like Whitehall , I worry about the long view . And I worry that you 've been brainwashed . Did Whitehall pull an MKUltra on you ? I 'm not one of those fanatics that HYDRA controls . Dr. Whitehall is a disciple of Red Skull , HYDRA 'S founder . Shared his vision . I 'm part of a grand history . Cut off one head and two will grow ... Two grow back . Yes , yes , yes . Hell , I 'll hand you the sword if Whitehall 's head will get you the gig . Whitehall will see your friends turned to stone . Those that haven 't already . So you think Bakshi was brainwashed ? No . But let the idea drive him nuts for a while . Any HYDRA member could 've been , wouldn 't know it . Yes , that 's true . Oh . Something Bakshi said , the language didn 't feel right . Called Whitehall a disciple of Red Skull . Weird choice . He didn 't say " studied . " And " shared his vision " ? That phrase , it 's past tense and the wording feels ... Firsthand . Yeah . I think Bakshi slipped . Maybe Whitehall and Red Skull have some sort of connection . Sounds logical , other than the fact that Red Skull 's been dead for over 70 years . Yeah , which is right around the time that SSR recovered the Obelisk . Clearly , whatever Red Skull did to get the Obelisk influenced Whitehall . This used to be an SSR base before Fury restored it . It 's full of SSR files . Get on it . Like Coulson 's been saying , know your enemies . I 'm sorry , hon . I 'll try to make it home this weekend , but with the strategy meetings , it 's just ... Okay . Love you . It 's me . Yep , wide open . My family 's summer place . Did you get my present yet ? Of course it 's see-through . That 's the point ... Hey , big brother . Heard you were looking for me . - What are we gonna do ? Storm Oahu ? - We don 't know yet . Ditch the guns . Take this . - What is it ? - It 's a watch . Deliver it to Cam , the owner of the Kahananui Repair Shop . Here . It 'll need the following inscription , " Dearest Darren , I count the seconds we 're apart . Love , Your Island Flower . " You got that ? Island Flower , got it . Anything else ? If it starts to leak any fluids , drop it , run . This does not sound like a watch . Take this to the Ka Pua dry cleaner on Makaimoimo Street . - Maka-what-now ? - Not the one on Ho 'okele Wa 'a . Am I good with this in my pocket ? That depends . You ever want kids ? - And bring back the blue tie . - You got it , sir . Get back here , ASAP . This bus has to be wheels-up in 4O minutes . - You got it . - Copy that . Any orders for me , sir ? You wanted to get back in the field ? Here 's your chance . That 's a transceiver . Or at least parts for one . I 'm gonna need you to install this in the field , under pressure , in less than six minutes . You are aware that I only have one hand that works good . That 's why you 'll practice it over and over until you 've got it down cold . Muscle memory . Don 't think about the action . Let the action help you think . Yeah . Piece of cake . What 's wrong ? You 're twirling . Having trouble figuring out Bakshi ? Bakshi ? No , no , no . I have him pegged . Grew up on the street , probably Southall . Worked hard to refine his accent , still struggles with the T 's . Parents weren 't around , got into petty crime . Military straightened him out till they sensed something off and washed him out . Ended up a private intelligence contractor . And you got all that from the eight words he said to you ? No , that last part I checked on . I think that he crossed Whitehall as an enemy , and Whitehall gave Bakshi a second chance . His borderline personality disorder makes him overvalue certain relationships , thank Mom and Dad for that , and one glimmer of belief from an authority figure like Whitehall ? Well , hail HYDRA . The puzzle I 'm working is Whitehall . Bakshi sees something in him that we don 't . I found decades of research , and it 's incomplete . But I did find the original 084 report . Signed by Agent Carter herself . Anything on Red Skull ? Did you hear what I said ? Peggy Carter , founder , happens to be British , held this in her hand . No . Anyway , no Red Skull , but a lot of references to one of his commanders . Werner Reinhardt . It says the Howling Commandos grabbed him and the Obelisk in ' 45 . Yes . And cites intake interviews , but all the important documents on him are missing . I question Coulson 's filing skills , to be honest . Vault D ? Not the only vault . Agent Carter buried a lot of things here . Werner Reinhardt . That was a neat trick . I 'm sorry , I don 't follow , Doctor . The pen . You wanted to see what I would do with it . After all , there are so many uses , no ? Escape , confession , homicide , suicide . It 's true . I wanted to find out what kind of man you were . You didn 't use the pen , so now I know . Pens are also used for signatures . You want a deal . How terribly shocking . The US Government has recruited many German scientists . They 'll send rockets into space . Maybe they can strap you to one of them . They 'll show you parlor tricks . Giving me a second chance could save all of humanity . I 've seen all of your home movies . The bodies left in your wake , the girl you caged up . There will be no second chances for you . You must be dying to understand all the items you recovered . They 're fascinating , no ? I don 't suppose you 'll tell me where they came from . There 's a story . A myth from the East of a star that fell from the heavens . Of blue angels who came bearing a gift for all mankind , meant to save the world . You don 't strike me as a believer . Oh , I 've based my whole life on it . History just has the details wrong . Then set history straight . These visitors ? They didn 't come to save the world . They came to conquer it . Conquer ? You heard " conquer " ? I think you got a bad translation . The way I understand it , it was " end . " To end mankind . Sparing a chosen few , needless to say . Hmm ... And that 's why it 's called the Diviner . Yeah . It decides who lives , who dies , who will inherit the Earth . And only someone who can carry the Diviner is allowed to enter the city . Or , more importantly , the temple inside . But I can get you in . And if I let you take a team , where will you take them ? How do you intend to find this city ? Well , I 'll have to look everywhere . Really , really hard . I 'm not giving you men and money on the off chance that you 'll find this place . Or if you do . That you 'll not take its true power for yourself . Me ? Nah . No , I 'm not management material . I 'll leave that power part to you . Then why ? What do you have to gain ? I have nothing to lose . I 've lost everything important to me . And I want to kill those who took it . And finally be reunited with my family . Reunited ? In the afterlife . Okay . Are we going to talk ? Or just go camping ? Look , I don 't know what HYDRA hopes to achieve , but I 'm sure you and I can come up with a better plan than kidnapping a senator . HYDRA doesn 't care about you . And they care about you ? Have they protected you ? Because I was the one who got you out of S.H.I.E.L.D. To have me executed . A public trial . Your face all over it . Is that what you think ? If I didn 't broker that deal and did the speech Mr. Coulson wanted me to on TV , would we be out here now ? You 're free because of me . I fought my way out . Through how many ? The four men I had on detail ? Keep going . I 'm enjoying this . - Enjoying what ? - Watching you work . No , I 'm trying to have an honest conversation . Okay ? One second I 'm gonna be meeting Anna , and the next thing I know you 're just dragging me through the dirt . Changing tactics , using my name , mentioning your wife . I used to fall for all of your tricks . That is not how I think , Grant . That 's how you think . - And now you 're turning it back on me . - No ... You take after Mother . Listen to yourself . Just listen to yourself . You twist every act and blame it on somebody else . Mom and Dad were terrible , but they didn 't put the match in your hand when you burned down that damn house ! And I didn 't squeeze the trigger when you killed all those people ! No . It is my fault . I let you all hollow me out . Control me . Spare the non-apology . I 'm a senator . I take responsibility for my actions , Christian . What are you ... The well . You still blame me for the well . We both know that it was you who nearly killed Thomas down there . Do you sleep better telling yourself that ? You know , I don 't know what crazy lies that you have built up all these years , but the well doesn 't even exist anymore . It 's gone . Morn and Dad buried it . Oh , no . They just covered it up . Now this one . Come on . Hey ! Whatever you 're doing , just take a break . What are you doing ? Coulson has me patching a transceiver into a system that 's not even meant to handle one . You can do that in your sleep . In my sleep , yes , I 'm quite good at it . Problem is , I 'm awake . I think Coulson 's testing me . No , Coulson doesn 't roll that way . If he has you in the dark , it 's for a reason . Hmm ... Or just keeping me busy . I just gave a button to a 300-pound Hawaiian dude . Look , we 've been through some crazy . You two especially . But the whole time , Coulson 's been our anchor . He may seem lost sometimes , but he 's always got a plan . Oh , Captain , my Captain . One blue necktie . Any complications out there ? Kept waiting for that other shoe . Great . Everything 's in motion then . Except the bus . Get us airborne . Where to , sir ? Australian Outback . We got a satellite network to steal , and very little time . Copy that . What 's the story with the tie ? It was a gift from Audrey , and I spilled poi all over it . Under six minutes . You can do it . Sorting paperwork . The life none of us chose . Anything from the interrogation ? Pretty good idea why the Reinhardt files were locked up . Yeah . There 's some nasty stuff in here . Thank God none of this stuff made it on the S.H.I.E.L.D. servers to be stolen away by HYDRA . Hang on . Hang on , I 've got it ! I 've got the Reinhardt file ! Complete SSR bio , psych eval . And a lovely picture of the Nazi bastard . Wait . No ... Yeah , name 's right beneath it . No , that 's Daniel Whitehall . What , you mean it looks like him ? No , I mean it 's the same man . I 've stared Whitehall in the face . - You 're joking . - It can 't be . He 'd be old as hell now . I would 've agreed with you before " alien " became a word we use daily . May , I know I 'm right . Bobbi was dead on . He did have a personal connection to Red Skull . What is this guy ? Asgardian ? It 's like he stopped the clock . Or turned it back . Where is that photo from ? An old S.H.I.E.L.D. prison called The Rat . How long was he kept there ? For life . So , curiosity brings her back . Have you come to make a deal ? With the devil ? I considered it . As you said , the skies might open up one day . Your work would be valuable . But if that day comes , I know who I 'd want by my side . Hmm . It isn 't you . We could learn so much together . Instead , we 'll forget . Forget you , forget your work . When I leave , no one else will come . No one to hear your stories , study your deadly artifacts . You 'll be buried . I seriously doubt that . Nothing stays buried forever . For as long as I have a say , you will . Farewell , Dr. Reinhardt . Werner Reinhardt ! Your lucky day . So who 's this guy again ? Some German researcher . Under Secretary Pierce took pity on him . Said it wasn 't his choice which side of the war he was on . Pierce is just trying to make himself look good . It 's budget cuts , my man . I 'll pull the truck around . Hail HYDRA . Hail HYDRA . After all these years , why now ? The woman . We found her . She 's still alive ? Is it truly her ? Sir , you have to see for yourself . So much lost time . It 's been under S.H.I.E.L.D. protection since the war . Like the rest of us . Who are these people ? We grabbed all the elders from the village and couldn 't believe what we found . I grew old , living no life . She lives a full one and doesn 't age a day . Sir , how is this possible ? I don 't know . But we 'll learn . Discovery requires experimentation . I think it 's time we found out exactly what makes you so special . Under Secretary Pierce grants medical parole in 1989 . After that , there are no records of Reinhardt . He drops his name , loses the accent . A year later , Daniel Whitehall surfaces . Whatever he did to survive happened in that year . Was it alien tech ? Where did he go ? The Fountain of Youth , apparently . May , I think we should cross-check the name Daniel Whitehall with any criminal activity from that time . There 's your hook , Bobbi , now reel him in . Tell me , your devotion to Whitehall . Based on fear or respect ? My devotion goes far deeper than respect . Fear goes way deeper for sure . That 's not what I meant . You meant programming ? I hear compliance will be rewarded . No ? So , what is it you 're so afraid of , huh ? What horrible acts do you fear Whitehall will perform on you ? I wonder if your friends know the acts that you are capable of . How you were able to ingratiate yourself to HYDRA ? Do you fear their judgment ? Should those details ever surface ? Fear of judgment . Perfectly said . You don 't fear Whitehall . You fear disappointing him . And let me tell you , he is going to be very disappointed to see that you gave him up . I didn 't give up anything . No , You gave us everything . Whitehall 's name , his Nazi adventures with Red Skull , his age . Did you know he 's hypertensive ? We do . I know he gave you a second chance . Now , do you think he 's gonna give you a third when you tell us how to kill him ? You failed your boss , Mr. Bakshi . I know who Whitehall is . Question remains , what kind of a man are you ? A loyal one . Cyanide ? We checked him ! Capsule embedded in his cheekbone ! You 're not getting off that easy . I don 't understand . What do you want out of all this ? I want the truth . About this one event from my past . Admit you made me push Thomas down the well . No . You forced him . He was terrified and you wouldn 't pull him up . You enjoyed it . You keep trying to put thoughts in my head . Like you always have . You used to convince me they were my own . Not anymore . You lie to yourself ! You wanna know why ? It 's simple . You can 't reconcile all the ugly , horrible things you do with the hero you so desperately want to become . You 're out of dirt . Sorry to see it go down this way . No ! No ! No ! No ! No . No ! Admit it ! Not to me , but to yourself . No ! It 's dark down there , Christian . You 'll have plenty of alone time to think . You think . Please ! I 'm your brother ! Please ! Goodbye , Christian . No ! All right , I did it ! I did , I know ! I wanted him dead ! I 'm sorry ! I wanted him dead ! Thomas was the only one Mother didn 't torture . And Dad always let her do it . She loved him so much . It had to end . I wanted her to feel our pain . But I didn 't have the courage to do it myself . I 'm sorry . Grant , I 'm so sorry . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . That 's all I wanted to hear . Come on . It 's time we went home . The satellite network we need to map the Earth and find the city is controlled by the US Air Force facility at Kaena Point , Oahu . And it 's too heavily guarded to infiltrate . Which is why we came to Australia instead . There 's a small station here that comes online whenever Kaena Point 's feed goes down . But Kaena still needs to go down . You already took care of that . The watch and the button are two pieces of a Trojan horse . They 'll take down the base 's feed . Man with the plan . Once per quarter , General Cole inspects Kaena Point . This time , he 'll meet the new relay commander . Let me guess . Commander 's name is Darren . That 's right . And since he 's new , introductions will be made . On their own , these two pieces are harmless , undetectable to security . But as they near each other , they 'll power up an EMP , and boom ! Kiss your Wi-Fi , your coffee maker , and your top-secret satellite feed goodbye . And the Australian site goes online . We 'll have roughly six minutes to patch a backend into the network . Trip , you 'll provide backup . Fitz , you 'll install the transceiver to let Skye hack the network , so that we can find out if the city exists once and for all . All because a general got too fat for his jacket . Fitz , how are you coming with the transceiver patch ? I 've got it down to seven minutes , 20 seconds . That 's not good enough . No , that 's with my bad hand . With both I can do it . Definitely . We may actually have a shot at finding the city . Are you sure it 's something you wanna dig up ? If we don 't , HYDRA will . We need to get there first . This doesn 't feel right . Skye , you reading us ? Standing by with Geek Squad . Paddington and Time Lord are closing in . EMP ready in 40 seconds . Copy that . - General . - Good day , sir . Kaena Point is down . Six minutes on the clock . Guys ? Skye , there 's something jamming our ... Down ! Down ! Ambush ! Fitz ! Untie the crew ! - HYDRA ! - How the hell did they get here ? Oh , uh ... It 's coming alive ! The server 's online ! Time to move . Find the access point . We can 't miss this window . Follow me . Now ! Get comms back online ! You guys are my satellite wranglers . I need vector scripts ready to execute the second Fitz gets us on that network . Lock yourselves inside . Go . Stay down . I need a few minutes . Fitz ! Down ! Trip ! Ah , damn it , Trip ! Trip , talk to me . - Oh , sir , he 's gonna bleed out . - We need to stop it . I can help . I 'm a doctor . Put pressure there , please . Uh-huh . Can you control it ? First went through clean , the second bullet is deep . There 's a lot of blood . Got to get it out . Hand me the scalpel . Clamp . Forceps . I prefer we stabilize and move . The bullet 's holding the wound open . If we keep our heads about us , he has a chance , Phil . Shouldn 't have said Phil . Not supposed to know that . You probably wouldn 't recognize me from the picture I left for her , though I haven 't changed as much as she has since then . If I let go of this clamp , he dies . I just sliced this man 's brachial artery . Mr. Coulson , hand me the gun . You too , son . Fitz . You 'd use this man 's life as a bargaining chip ? An opportunity , actually . To get out of this sticky situation . And we get to know each other a bit . Skye wouldn 't want Trip to die . She 's not here , is she ? That 's a relief . I 'm only gonna get one chance at a first impression . This doesn 't look very good . You 've already made an impression . A pile of bodies , going to work for Whitehall . I don 't think it 's good for Skye to see ... You 're not her father ! You 're S.H.I.E.L.D. , who took her from me . I need Whitehall . The end will justify the means . The end ? And that 's gonna happen in the city we 're both here to find ? Yes . I anticipated you 'd be close , but you 're already trying to map the Earth . I guess we had the same idea . Whitehall didn 't even know about the city until I turned him onto it . He thinks the Diviner is just a weapon . He has no idea of its true power . Of what 's inside . Oh ! There 's something inside . What are we talking about ? Tesseract-level power ? Sure . I don 't know what that is . You realize we 're talking life and death here ? I know . It 's exciting , isn 't it ? I mean , both sides racing to the temple . Life and death . Flesh and blood . Emotions ! Who knows how it 'll shake out ? All I know is my baby 's gonna be right there in the center of it . I know you wanna meet her . Oh , I can 't wait . I mean , I have to wait for the right circumstances . But ... 'Cause if you let this man die , Skye will never ... That 's not her name ! And I won 't let him die . I 'm gonna tell you just how to save him . Which will give me time to get away . Two syringe packets inside . Sorry , it 's a bit of a mess in there . When I release this , you 're gonna pump his wounds full of that clotting agent as fast as you can , if you wanna save his life . And apply pressure . Okay ? Here we go . We 'll find you . And when we do , you and I will finish this conversation . I look forward to it . Fitz ? Quickly , Fitz , quick . Okay , done ! Get the other one ready ! We haven 't heard from them in over five minutes . Wait . Wait , wait , wait . The transceiver 's powering up . Yes , Fitz ! Okay , prioritize all thermal and ground-penetrating imaging . Okay , hold on , Trip . Hold on ! Okay . Come on . Okay . He 's stabilizing . As a person who spent a considerable portion of his life incarcerated , I know how rare second chances are . If you 're given one , take it . The opportunity may be fleeting . So it must be recognized and seized . Sometimes the solution takes days . Or weeks . Or years . But no matter the sacrifice , one must be willing to endure the trauma of shaking off all that you were . To become something new . Something better . What did you take from her , sir ? Everything that I possibly could . Dispose of the rest . Everyone deserves a second chance . But few are willing to do what it takes to earn one . I completely understand . I think my skills could be of use to you . I know sacrifice . What it takes to move forward in life . I have no doubt that 's true . The bodies of Massachusetts Senator Christian Ward and both his mother and father were identified by police tonight in what appears to be a murder-suicide . A partially-destroyed tape found in the fire is believed to be the Senator 's confession . I wanted him dead ! I did . The only one Mother didn 't torture . It had to end . I wanted her to feel our pain . You okay ? Yeah . What 's up ? Nothing . Hell of a day . Please don 't " hell-of-a-day " me . What 's wrong ? You pushed him a little hard , didn 't you ? What did you think was gonna happen ? I miscalculated . I thought he was gonna talk . You sure you weren 't afraid he was gonna talk ? He 's laying out all your dirty laundry , and suddenly you lay him out . You think I would do that ? I can 't argue a man to suicide . Clearly , you 've never been in an argument with yourself then . You had him right where you wanted him . What is it you wanna know , huh ? I 'll tell you . Doesn 't matter what I ask . I can 't trust the answer . Write that sentence down . Hand it to your therapist . I have always been honest with you . And you can 't accept it . You search for lies . You 're an elite spy . I 'd be crazy not to ! You know you 've lied to me . This happens every time . We get closer , you get nervous ! We 're not close ! You just spent the day convincing a man he was brainwashed . I don 't know where the angles end . With you ! Why do you think I vouched for you with Coulson , huh ? As much as I 'd like to believe it 's my magical personality , I think you have something up and running , and need allies . And know that I 'll have your back , whatever it is . Will you never trust me ? But I 'll never stop wanting to . It 's been running for a few hours . Twenty-six satellites scouring the world for your map . Good . Multispectral images , ground-penetrating radar . Now we wait for the ding that says we have a match . If there 's evidence of this city on Earth , the computer will find it . Guys ? Is everything okay ? They 're patching Trip up , and he 's gonna be fine . But you 're acting like you saw the devil out there . What ? Doctor , how nice to see you . Please , come . Sit . You 've had a long night . You should tell me when we 're having a meeting . I would 've freshened up . Mr. Ward here is something of an expert on S.H.I.E.L.D. And you an expert on the Obelisk . Together , I think there 's much we can achieve . I was a member of Coulson 's team . Lived with them for months . So you know the entire team ? Like family . Heard you crossed Coulson . That can be rough . Oh , it wasn 't a complete loss . It 's always good to look your enemy right in the eye . Oh , God . Oh , God ! Oh , my love . I 'll find him . I 'll do to him what he did to you . I 'm gonna tear him apart .

 Previously on Alphas ... I have this thing where I can 't remember anything that happened , like , more than a month ago . That 's gotta be lonely . You said that you would bring my dad around to our way of thinking . Do you understand everything I 'm risking for this ? Someone close to us is working with Parish . Cameron , is that one of Dani 's paintings ? Yeah , she just finished it . You haven 't seen it before ? Yes , I have . This is what we came here for , the ultimate rush . Hold this . Put it under your tongue . It gets hot , and you 'll feel it moving through your body . Just look at your hands . You 'll know when it kicks in . - This is insane . - That 's why it 's so awesome . It 's not gonna hurt , right ? No . All right , who 's first ? - Let 's go . - Let 's do it . High dive from the 21st floor . - Right ? - That was awesome ! - That was amazing . - Totally . Are we doing it again ? Hey , Doc , you want whip cream ? No , not for me . Thanks , Nathan . Uh , forgive me for intruding on your family this way , especially at this hour . Not a problem . When you said the investigation into Parish 's inside source is moving forward , um ... What do you mean ? The abduction was a break for us . When your team tracked you down , they opened a door into Parish 's communications network . Now , it closed pretty fast , but we were able to get a flash clone of his cell log . Every number Parish called , every number that called him . It 's encrypted . Tight as hell , but NSA 's been working overtime to decode it . They could have something solid on his inside source in three , maybe four days . Four days ? And then you 'll be certain ? We 're moving as fast as we can , Doc . Believe me , I want to get this S.O.B. as bad as you do . Daddy , daddy ! We don 't have any tape . This guy tells me last night he 's got a model of the whole solar system that 's due today . You better hurry up . Thanks . I don 't know . Do you help ' em ? Kids have to learn how to deal with their own problems , right ? Indeed , they do . Yeah . Nathan , I 'd love to have a look at whatever you have concerning these encrypted phone numbers . I can 't do that . These internal investigations are tight . I can 't even involve my own people . We 'll get him , and he will never see daylight again , because I 'm gonna put him in a room and I 'm gonna throw away the room . This is from the net . Analysts kicked this video over to us . Now , either there are four people with the exact same Alpha ability , or there 's some kinda drug that 's turning people into Alphas . Either way , we need to get to the bottom of this . Right , Bill . I trust you to take the reins on this one . Uh , okay , I can do that . So you just want me to keep you updated ? Yes , please . Gare , got you a present . Tada ! Oh ... This is a plant . Yep . You 're not supposed to just give someone a plant . This could have bugs in it . You 're welcome . It 's for your man cave . Bill , we need to call the exterminators . - Oh , come on , Gary . - Kat 's brought some bugs into the office . All right . Gary , I just sent you a YouTube link , okay ? I need you both to focus . Focus is my middle name . No , you can 't know that for sure . Gary , I need you to do face grabs off the video , okay ? - I- - - Check the Internet for any matches , okay ? We 're looking for any indication that these people may be Alphas . Hey , what about me ? You can call the exterminator . Bring bugs in here ? You take care of that . Douche bag . - Hey . - Hey . So I thought of another thing for Friday night . My mom will offer you coffee as soon as you get there , but you must turn her down three times before accepting it , and then once you take it , you have to drink it all . Every last sip . Okay , I 'll make sure I come thirsty . Oh ! And don 't compliment anything in the house , like a painting or a lamp , because they 'll insist that you take it home with you , and then afterwards , they 'll complain about it , like , " you 're the boy who stole the lamp . " I 'm serious . Oh , I know . It 's just ... you 're cute when you 're worried . Does this look like the face of a worried person ? - Rachel . - Uh-huh ? You know I 've been in actual combat , right ? Yes . I think I can handle dinner with your parents . Yes . Yeah . - Okay . - Okay . Breathe . Deep breaths . So he 's not an Iranian lawyer . Your parents will just have to deal . He 's the blondest boy I have ever seen . They 're gonna rip him to shreds . Mwah ! Lala , daddy ! Dr. Rosen . Gary , w-would you close the door , please ? Gary , I need you to handle an assignment for me . I 'm already doing a case for Bill . But I-I can multitask . Gary , um- - you can 't speak to anyone about this . If , uh , that makes you uncomfortable , I understand . No , I 'm not uncomfortable , 'cause I 'm a secret agent . Secret 's what I do best . Secret 's my middle name . Hey , Tyler ! How are you , pal ? How was the flight ? Bumpy , but they had TVs . There 's somebody I want you to meet . This is my friend Dani . Hey , Tyler . I hate it when the flight 's bumpy too . Come on . Hey , that 's a- - that 's a nice deck . How long you been skating ? A while . Well , I know this cool skate park over on the westside . You wanna check it out ? Sweet . Um , Dad , can we go ? Yeah , of course we can . Busted ! Bill ! She 's a criminal ! She 's busted , and I get to cuff her . Hey , get up ! Assume the position ! Get up ! You assume the position . Get off me . Bill , bring your cuffs ! Gary , what the hell are you talking about ? The - I found the guy from the video . Look . He 's , like , the ringleader . - Yeah . - And this is his Facebook . And that picture , it was taken last year . Okay , so ? So , Bill , look there . It 's her . She 's one of them . I kinda look hot with pink highlights . ? Alphas 2x08 ? Falling Original Air Date on September 17 , 2012 ? ? ? Don 't take no ? ? for an answer ? ? and there 's no telling ? ? where we 've been ? = = sync , corrected by elderman = = ? ' cause people don 't understand ? ? understand , understand ? ? people don 't understand ? ? people like me ? Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . This picture 's only showing that she met the guy , right ? We don 't even know if he 's doing anything wrong . No , he is doing something wrong , Bill . It 's drugs . This is drug-related . It 's called " Jump . " I found more videos . Okay , so , Kat , I don 't suppose you remember who this guy is , do you ? No . But he 's having a party tonight , and if Gary can get his address , I can get reacquainted . I mean , maybe score a little Jump . Uh , I 'm essential to this case now , right ? No , I 'm not gonna send you in blind . Okay , you don 't even remember if you know the guy , or where you left things with him . But you 'll have my six . I 'll be fine . No ! Bill 's not gonna have your six . - Gary . - He 's my partner ! He gets my six . You 're not even a real federal agent . Gary , Gary , please . Let 's--let me take it from here . - Oh , I leave ? - Yeah . You 're in cahoots . Kat , undercover work is no joke . You don 't have any field training , okay ? And if this Dylan Renfro guy is dangerous- - I kicked your ass . Aren 't you supposed to forget things ? I wrote that one down . ? He said to lose my life ? ? or lose my love ? Right . ? That 's the nightmare I 've been running from ? ? so let me hold you in my arms a while ? Locate Dylan and feel things out . Anything seems off , get the hell outta there . Relax . I watched New York Undercover and Donnie Brasco last night . I got this . It 's real life , not a movie , girl . Kat ! ? My soul will soar above the trees ? I 've been looking everywhere for you . Kickass party . You don 't have a clue who I am , do you ? I 've been pushed off your mental TiVo . Maybe you should refresh my memory . You mind ? Do I look like I mind ? ? Let 's grow old together ? That 's gross . Oh , come on . Kat , why are you kissing this guy ? I don 't wanna see that . ? Let 's grow old together ? We were together . Yeah , I can kinda tell . ? I said I 've got no time ? ? I have to go ? What the hell , Dylan ? Easy , April . Kat 's an old friend . Hey . I thought we were gonna hang out tonight . Just give us a minute . ? He said my heart is feint ? ? will minds regret ? I get the feeling I 'm getting in the middle of something . Are you guys together ? Are you kidding ? You 're irreplaceable . Um ... What are they doing ? Havin ' a good time . - Damn . - Whoa . That 's not a fun party , Bill . Come on ! Not even a scratch . I 'll have what he 's having . You mean this ? ? And die at the same time ? ? let 's grow old together ? ? and die at the same time ? ? let 's grow old together ? ? and die at the same time ? ? let 's grow old together ? What exactly does this stuff do , anyway ? Come on . I 'll show you . Kat , where you goin ' ? Kat , you 're going out of range , okay ? I can 't hear you . Gary , follow her on the comm . - Yeah , yeah , in the alleyway . - Follow her signal . We should just leave her . She 's useless . Watch your step . Come on . - Can I open them now ? - No . - Please ? - No , a couple more steps . Now . I was hoping you 'd come back so we could do this together . Come on ! You were always crazy brave , right ? I know you forget stuff , but that doesn 't change who you really are . Trust me , kitty Kat . Kat ? You all right ? It was incredible ! Mmm , no , we gotta go . We gotta go . So my mom 's gonna keep on offering you food no matter how full you are , and you have to keep on eating it . - All right , good tip . - Okay . - Rachel . - Yeah ? You speak Farsi . Six years in the Middle East , you 're bound to pick up a couple things . Hey , I 'm complicated . You don 't peel back an onion like this in a couple weeks . John ... You should 've told me that . I wanted it to be a surprise . There are rules , Kat . And rule number one : You don 't dive off a freaking roof . That doesn 't sound like a real rule . Everything 's a joke to you , isn 't it ? Kat , where you going ? I should 've never let you go undercover . Why , because I did so well ? Look , there 's a weird-ass drug out on the street , and I got a sample of it . Plus , I found out what my favorite color is . You have a sample of it ? It 's green . Thanks for asking . Where 's the sample , Kat ? Right in here . Who 's Donnie Brasco now , bitch ? I made that . I made that with a label maker . We don 't have any " top secret " stickers . We needed some , so I- - I made 200 . This is what Cley got off Parish 's phone . The NSA is still working on it , but I cracked it . You didn 't even ask me to , but I cracked it anyway . Well , what does it mean ? It means that I took initiative . No , I know , Gary . Um , thank you . But , no , the numbers . Oh , yeah , you were right . It 's telephone numbers . It 's a very complicated system , Dr. Rosen . It was--it 's even harder to crack than Anna 's code , but I think it must 've been made by a-a supercomputer , or an Alpha . Gary , I want you to write down any of these numbers in the New York area that are still active , all right ? Yeah . You saw that thing with the can , right ? You mean when he threw it in the garbage ? Yeah , he 's quite the little environmentalist . Off the wall , into the recycling bin , and he was barely even looking . Cam , don 't . I mean , what if he is ? Does it matter ? Yes , it matters . Maybe I can help him understand it , you know , so he doesn 't feel like such a freak . I don 't know , I think I should ask your dad to run some tests on him . No , no , no , no . Listen . My dad ran a few tests on me . It basically ruined my life . This is your ruined life ? Uh , you , me , and ice cream ? No , this is ... pretty friggin ' perfect . I love you , you know that ? Hey . Me too . Dad ? Are we playing video games ? Yeah , pal , hang on . Get ready to get your butt kicked . - Yeah , okay . - All right . Here we go . Oh , wow . What ? The compound in Kat 's blood . It reshaped the tissue at the molecular level , creating a short-term form of chitinous , which ... What ? It ... it made , um , a protective shield around the body like Kevlar skin . So jump makes you indestructible ? Maybe not . One of the kids in the video , Tony Dolan , he was found dead a day after he jumped . Let 's get an autopsy on that , please . I already got it , but it doesn 't mean I actually understand it . Tony died of cardiac fibrosis . The hardening didn 't stop at his skin . It solidified his heart . Yeah , there were eight cases of cardiac fibrosis in the metropolitan area . That 's in the last three weeks . So Jump can make you indestructible , but it can also kill you . Kat , we need to get you checked out , and we gotta get this drug off the streets . Dad . Hi , Danielle . What 's wrong ? Is--is mom okay ? Everything 's fine as far as I know . I just wanted to see you . It 's , uh ... It 's been a while . Well , um , come on up . Sorry . It 's , uh ... the same as always . Wow , these are different . Yeah . Uh , it 's not done yet . Well , they 're nice , uh , very nice . Oh , my goodness . You still have this one after all these years . Yeah . I still like the way the hands came out . Yeah , in Mr. Tzodee 's class , 7th grade , right ? - Yeah . - Boy , you hated him . I think you said it was his bad breath . Yeah . Oh , I really did tell you everything back then , didn 't I ? Well , you still can , Dani . Yeah ? Sure . Oh , there is , um ... there 's one thing . Cameron . - Right . - I mean ... this is me we 're talking about . I just keep wondering how I 'm gonna screw it up . It 's inevitable , right ? Dani , nothing 's inevitable . Not in this life , anyway . Yeah , and I 'm starting to believe that too . Right . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just , uh- - just , you know , uh- - I 'd love a cup of tea . Yeah . Uh , yeah , of course , yes . You make yourself at home . Still no sugar , right ? Uh , right . There you go . Oh , yes . Lapsang souchong road tar tea . I remember . - Morning . - Morning . I know that look , Lee . Don 't worry . I 'm all over this . Got the NSA to triple their manpower on the investigation . You came by house to light a fire under my ass , and I heard you , loud and clear . Thank you for your diligence . Oh , by the way , Nathan ... how 'd it turn out with your son 's solar system project ? I did Neptune and Saturn , and had to hear about 300 Uranus jokes . Kid needs your help , what are you gonna do ? Hey , tonight 's the night , huh ? John versus the Pirzads . Should be on pay-per-view . He speaks Farsi . Well , great . He 'll knock it out of the park . Yeah . I canceled dinner . I thought this was what you wanted . It is . I mean , it was . All right , spill . What if my parents actually like him ? Then what ? Then you have a hot boyfriend . That 's what people call a real relationship . Not that it 's a topic I know much about at the moment . What if I 'm not ready ? The last time I had a real boyfriend ... was over three years ago . Three years , no sex ? I can 't . With him , I had to get so drunk I couldn 't feel anything . That was three years ago , and John isn 't that guy . Yeah . But I 'm still me . And I 'm a total freak . No , Rachel , you 're not . Think of everything you 've done since then . Think of everything you do here , every day . You 're strong , and you 're capable , and we 're all freaks . That 's my favorite ? Chocolate chili and rum raisin ? Really ? You 're messing with me . Seriously ? Where 's the trust ? Okay . Oh , that 's really good . It 's disgusting . But you love it . I 'm starting to think I 'm really weird . But so friggin ' cute . So , uh , what are we doing tonight ? Can we get more Jump ? I can get as much as we want . Got the New York franchise . Do you deal it ? Let 's just say I know where to get it . Mm . I have something . It 's yours . You gave it to me the last time I saw you . This is mine ? This is mine . The first day we met , you were hustling money doing that knife trick from aliens . Just trust me . You know the one where you stab really quickly in between your fingers really fast ? I thought you were badass . You thought I was handsome . We were both right . Who 's J.D. ? I have no idea . Before my time . I really missed you , Kat . You can 't arrest him . Kat , this is rule number two for field work , okay ? Whatever I say is what goes . Now , we 're gonna arrest him , okay ? We 're gonna lean on him , and then he gives up his source . That 's the way it works , Kat . But-but I-I can get him to tell me who 's making this stuff . I know I can . Kat , you got out of him what you could , okay ? Now , in an hour , I will have an arrest warrant . Now , you did your job . Let me do mine . Thank you . Nice one , pal . Hey , listen . I want you to hit this next one right down the third base line , okay ? Come on , pal , you 're not even trying . I suck , okay ? I don 't wanna hit balls anymore . I just- - I just wanna go home . Okay , look . We 'll go home . We 'll , uh , we 'll play video games , all right ? Whatever you wanna do . No . I wanna go home . My home . Tyler . Hey , that 's for an official government vehicle . You 're not allowed to take that . And you 're gonna go and help a drug dealer . You 're not allowed to do that either . Gary , Gary , look . I care about this guy . It 's like you care about Bill , and if he was in trouble , you 'd help him , right ? Yeah , I 'd help him . Yeah , I 'd get his six , 'cause he 's my partner , but we 're federal agents . You 're just a civilian . No , Gary . Gary , you 're right . - Yeah , I know I 'm right . - Look , I need your help . I 'm not authorized to do this on my own . Only a real federal agent can check out an official government vehicle . What do you say ? Huh ? I can 't be b--yeah , yeah . But I 'm driving . Okay , fine . Can you drive ? Yeah , of course . I passed the test online . I got a perfect score . But I 'm better if I don 't drive on roads where there are other cars or people , just ' cause- - ' cause they don 't always obey the rules , and I could mow people down . Okay , how ' bout on the way back ? I , uh--yeah , okay . You wanted to see me ? Hi , Nina . You okay ? I need a favor , Nina . Sure . You 've always been there for me . How long would it take you to get a passport under a false name ? I could walk into a federal building and come out with one today . Dani ? Tyler , I 'm sorry , okay ? Whatever I did , I 'm sorry . Whatever , Dad . I just wanna go home . - Come on . - Hey , hey , hey , hey . Come on . Hey , what happened ? I took him to the park to hit a few balls . Okay , Dani , I had to know . No , Cam , you didn 't . Hey , Ty , can you come out here for a minute ? I don 't wanna talk to him . Okay , well , you don 't have to talk to him . You can just talk to me . I don 't wanna talk to you either . I don 't even know you . That 's fair enough . How about no talking ? Promise . Tyler , have you heard about Alphas ? Dani ! I guess . Well ... I am one . Give me your hand . Cameron , this is how you made Tyler feel today . Tyler , this is how your dad feels about you . Oh , pal , I am so sorry . Dad ? I thought that you were disappointed in me . But this ... feels like ... I don 't know what to call it . It 's just how I feel , pal . It 's love , Tyler . Here , come here . Parish is manipulating her . She 's hooked on his ideology . And Cley is on the verge of catching her , Nina . I just have to get her away from here . Away where ? Anywhere where Cley or Parish can never find her , ever . Now , I have some money set aside- - Yeah , a recovering addict in a strange place ? With no support system and money to- - she 'll be dead in three months . They 'll send her to Binghamton , Nina . You know they will . Well , I suppose I 'm as much at fault as she is . I 've made so many mistakes . Dani 's made her own . You can 't keep blaming a screwed up family life forever . You taught me that , remember ? Maybe the best thing you can do is just ... Let Cley do his job . No . No , no , no , no , no . You know how Cley handles things . Anything could happen . She could be dead on the street . Nina , she 's my daughter . Dylan ? Dylan ! You 've gotta get outta here right now . Where are we going ? Look , not " we , " you . Look , I 'm working with the government , sort of . Look , a TAC team 's gonna bust down your door and arrest you . You gotta go . I trusted you . And I 'm here to make it right . We don 't have much time . Okay , okay . Just let me grab some stuff . Dylan ? What the hell ? What are you doing ? Oh , my God . You 're the source . He 's mine . I 'm his Alpha now . No , we 're getting out of here . We are leaving . No . Come on . I 'm gonna get you out of here . I wanna be with him . He 's using you . He 's going to kill you . She 'll be fine , kitty Kat . She 's my golden goose . I 'll take care of her , just like I took care of you . You 're such a boy scout . You 're always getting pissed off about something . And I always find you , after you forget . We 'll do this again . We always do . Couple of months from now , you 'll be back in my bed . Kat . Kat ! Kat , come on , get up . Get up . You weren 't answering your earbud , so I-I came for you . I got your six . - Oh , thanks , Gare . - Yeah . He 's getting away . I called the police , but they 're not here ye- - oh , no , don 't do that ! Those are drugs . Come on . Kat , that 's drugs . Don 't do drugs ! Bill said no drugs , Kat . Get in . Get in . Come on , kick in . Come on ! Screw it ! Oh , oh ! Reconsider . Whoa , whoa , no--oh-oh ! Never touch me again . Well , um , have a good flight . - See you in a bit . - Yeah . Come on . Hey , hey , easy tiger . Excuse- - easy . I didn 't have anything with him . Just his piece of Alpha ass . Well , the good thing is that you won 't even remember in a couple weeks , right ? Yeah , that 's the problem . I 'm the perfect mark . Who knows what the hell he had me learn to make him a few bucks ? Well , according to him , he could never get you to do anything too crazy . Just pick a couple of pockets or rewire some alarms . Did you beat that out of him ? No . I told him that , uh , I 'd give you another shot at him . Thanks . For a second , I thought that actually meant something . Probably wasn 't even mine . It 's yours now . Why don 't you let that be a memento of your first time undercover . All right ? Oh , no , come on . Mmm . Come on , come on . Ah , nah , nah . Shouldn 't do that . That 's inappropriate . We don 't squeeze other agents . Oh , good thing I 'm not a real agent then , huh ? Speaking of which , I can no longer send an untrained and undisciplined civilian into the field . Quantico 's FBI Academy . Now , normally , this program takes about two years to complete . I pulled some strings . I think you can tackle it in about ... two weeks ? - Oh , thank you ! - All right . Oh , thank you , thank you , thank you ! I didn 't hear a yes . Is that a yes ? - Oh , thank you , Gary ! - Oh , no , don 't--no . Don 't do that to me . No , I don 't like that . Ooh , Gary ! You 're squeezing my six . Come on . Grow up . Dad ! Uh , what are you doing here ? He isn 't coming , Dani . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I Parish . He 's not coming . I sent the message . You think you know everything . No , no , I don 't . You don 't know him . You don 't know me . Well , I know enough right now to know that if you keep- - I was on the street when he found me . Okay , I-I was ... Nothing . I was screwing guys for a bag of dope , Dad . $ 10 . Okay , that--that 's who I am . I am your father , Dani . That 's why I am here . I want to help you . I don 't need your help . I didn 't do this to hurt you . He said he would bring us together . That 's never going to happen . Please , Dani , don 't run . Don 't . What did you do ? I just need you to be safe . Dani ... I need to see your hands . Dani , show me your hands . John , the guns aren 't necessary . Dr. Rosen , I 've got this . Back off ! Dani , I have to take you into custody now . I want you to put your hands on your head . I want you to lay face down . What the hell is wrong with you , hmm ? Cameron- - You turned her in ! Please , understand , if I had any other option , I would have exercised it . She 's your kid ! You 're supposed to protect her . You were supposed to protect her . I just really feel like I should have seen it . None of us did . I mean , not even Rosen . He must be heartbroken . No , hearts don 't really break . They can stop , and they can leak , but they can 't really break . It just--it gets tired . Gives up after a while . Dani , I know how difficult this must be for you . No . No , it 's a relief . Dad ... Dad , can you do something for me ? Of course . Tell them to put me in building seven . Put a chip in my head . Oh , God , Dani . - Please , dad , please . - Oh , my God , no . I just want to forget . I want to disappear . No ! I 'm not gonna do that . Dani , that- - that 's not gonna happen . Listen . This--this isn 't the end , Dani . It 's- - There 's an opportunity here . It- - yes , yes , there is a way out . I don 't want a way out . Will you--will you please listen to me , please ? Please , Dani . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

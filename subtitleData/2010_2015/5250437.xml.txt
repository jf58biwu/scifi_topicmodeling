 [ xxRaZoRxx ] Mayday , Mayday , this is Hesper 299 in distress . Dad ! Engines 1 and 2 are off-line ! We 're losing her ! Go ! Go ! Dad ! I 've heard stories of Earth . A paradise . Until we destroyed it . The founding of the United Ranger Corps 1000 years ago was a global military effort , an evacuation of Earth . The Rangers would lead the settlement of mankind 's new home . Nova Prime . But we were not alone . The aliens released the Ursa . Monsters bred to kill humans . Technically blind , the Ursa sees humans based on pheromones we secrete when frightened . They literally smell our fear . Humankind was again in danger of extinction and again turned to the Rangers for the answer . And that answer came in the form of the prime commander , Cypher Raige the original ghost . He 's believed to be so completely free of fear that to an Ursa , he is invisible . This phenomena is known as " ghosting . " This isn 't a race , cadet ! Raige . Your test scores are very impressive . In the classroom , you are an outstanding Ranger but in the field , you collapse . I 'm not advancing you . You may try again next year . Sir , I am dedicated , I have studied and consistently display conduct becoming of a Ranger , sir . I request that the commander reconsider his assessment , sir . - Cadet . - Sir , my father 's returning home tonight . I haven 't seen him in ... It 's a very special day for our family . And I have got to be able to tell him that I am a Ranger , sir . You tell your father that I said , " Welcome home . " Dismissed . Faia . Hi . How were finals ? - How were finals ? - I wasn 't advanced to Ranger . Where do we look when we speak ? I was not advanced to Ranger . You were not advanced to Ranger ... I was not advanced to Ranger , sir . That 's all right . You 're young . I ran the canyons 11 seconds faster than you did . You weren 't ready . Velan 's a good man . He knows his stuff . If you were , he would have promoted you . You weren 't ready . I 'm not hungry . I 'm going to my room . - Are you asking me or telling me ? - May I go to my room ? Denied ! Sit down ! I have a last visit to Iphitos . I 'm flying tomorrow , supervising training . And after it 's completed I 'm announcing my retirement . Retirement ? Maybe I 'll work with you in Turbine Division . - Together . - Please , no . I want my family back . I want you back . That boy in there is trying to find you . He 's a feeling boy . He 's an intuitive boy . He watched you read that book with Senshi his entire life . He 's reading that book now . He 's reaching for you . Don 't get me wrong . I respect everything you 've done . But you have a son in the other room that you do not know . He blames himself for what happened to Senshi . He thinks it 's his fault . He 's drowning . And he does not need a commanding officer . He needs a father . Pack your bags . You 're coming with me to Iphitos . This was a really good decision . Now go make some good memories together . You take it easy on your father . He 's a little rusty . Okay . General Raige . I was on the plateau . You saved me and four others . I just came from seeing my baby girl 's face for the first time . - Stand me up . - That won 't be necessary , Ranger . Stand me up . Watch the left side ! Pull ! Perimeter 's good . I 'm reading a Moby Dick . Your mother told me . That 's great . Our military transport will arrive at training base on Iphitos in seven hours . I 'm going to grab some rack time . I recommend you do the same . Hey . Can you read ? I said , can you read ? Yes , sir . Well , there 's a sign back there . " Authorized personnel only . " Why didn 't you read that ? What 's in the cage ? Might wanna go easy on him , sarge . That 's the prime commander 's son right there . You 're Raige 's kid ? What 's in there ? You wanna see ? - Kit , we have to go right now . - Is that ... ? They surprised us . Sent ships , dropped those things . An Ursa ? We 're taking it to Iphitos for ghost training . You want to see if you can ghost ? Ghosting is when you don 't have a trace of fear in you . Most guys freeze . That 's your cerebral cortex looking for an answer it doesn 't have . See ? Even your brain knows you 're screwed . Your blood is filling with adrenaline now whether you know it or not . Your heart 's beating faster . It 's getting a little harder to breathe . Your neurobiological system is telling you to run but your knees are too weak to move . And it 's too late anyway . The pores on your skin have already opened up secreting an imperceptible amount of pheromones into the air . And all you can think about is when it 's going to kill you . Senshi ! She sees you , kid . Attention on deck . Kitai . Back to your seat , now . Rangers , go Redcon-1 . Secure all cargo ! Behind your seat , there 's a life suit . Put it on . Strap in , full harness . Yes , sir . - Good evening , general . - Captain . What 's the last known position of the closest asteroid storm ? Category-four asteroid formation . Two thousand kilometers to starboard at plus-four-five declination . I detected graviton vibrations in the hull . But you detected how ? Graviton buildup could be a precursor to mass expansion . That storm could be on us in minutes . But , sir , mass expansion is one in a million . If we try to navigate out the pull of our own graviton weight could set the thing off . Let 's just hold course and hope I 'm wrong . Just out of interest , sir , how often are you wrong ? My wife would give a very interesting answer to that question . Graviton count 's decreasing . Eight hundred parts per million . Six hundred and fifty . Well , sir , there 's a first time for everything . Turn into it . Match bearing . Dad ! She 's a dead stick ! Engines off-line ! We 're losing her ! - Can you travel us out of here ? - Where ? The anchorage . Lycia . It 's closest . Negative , sir . We cannot Wormhole travel in the middle of this . Do it . Coordinates for anchorage at Lycia locked in . No confirmation signal . Travel us now . - Without confirmation ... - That 's an order . Go ! Go ! Cabin pressure dropping . Heavy damage to outer hull . Breach possible in middle cabin . Find me something I can land on . Now . I got something . Bearing 3-4-0 by 9-5 , range 86,000 . Warning . This planet has been declared unfit for human habitation placed under class-one quarantine by the interplanetary Authority . Under penalty of law , do not attempt to land . Repeat , do not attempt to land . It 's not possible . The computer might have defaulted back to a known demarcation point . No , not here . Travel us again . Negative , sir . This ship is going to tear apart at any moment . Set her down . Mayday , Mayday , this is Hesper 299 in distress . We took damage from an asteroid storm and are going down with bingo power . Dad , Dad , Dad ! Dad ! You all right ? You stay there . Evaluate . Good to go . Confirm the Ursa is contained . The back of the ship is gone . Rangers , count off . Rangers , count off ! Kit . The cockpit is directly above us . Go . Left rear , there 's a utility compartment . Inside there 's an emergency beacon . Silver . Like a saucer . Bring it to me . Consolidate . Inventory up . General Cypher Raige . We crash-landed . Two confirmed survivors . Kitai . The emergency beacon you brought me will fire a distress signal deep into space . But it is damaged . There is another one in the tail section of our ship . This is us here . That is the tail , somewhere in this area . It 's approximately 100 kilometers from here . We need that beacon . Do you understand ? Both my legs are broken , one very badly . You are going to retrieve that beacon or we are going to die . Do you understand ? Repeat what I just said to you . I have to go retrieve the beacon or we 're going to die . You have air filtration inhalers . You need to take one now . The fluid will coat your lungs , increasing oxygen extraction allowing you to breathe comfortably in the environment . You have six vials . At your weight , that should be 20 to 24 hours each . That 's more than enough . Your life suit and backpack are equipped with digital and virtual imaging so I will be able to see everything that you see and what you do not see . I will guide you . It will be like I 'm right there with you . Take my cutlass . It 's the C-40 . The full , 22 configurations . Kitai every single decision you make will be life or death . This is a class-one quarantined planet . Everything on this planet has evolved to kill humans . Do you know where we are ? No , sir . This is Earth . The Ursa ? Three possibilities . The first and most likely is that it died in the crash . The second and less likely is that it is injured very badly and still contained . The third and least likely is that it is out . We will proceed , however , in anticipation of the worst-case scenario . Every movement will be under protocol Escape and Evade . If he 's out there I will see him long before he gets anywhere near you . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . Do exactly as I tell you and we will survive . Kitai , calm down . Take a knee . Root yourself in this present moment now . Sight , sound , smell . What do you feel ? My body feels heavier . Very good . Earth 's gravitational pull is different than at home . Very good . Now let 's go . What happened ? - You didn 't see that ? - Kitai , what happened ? I 'm fine . No change . I just slipped . There 's condensation on the stones . I 'm good to go . General Cypher Raige . Initiating remote probe recon . Primary target Ursa . I want to reiterate that your naviband is our sole means of communication . Roger . The temperatures on this planet fluctuate dangerously , Kitai . And most of the planet freezes over completely at night . But there are hot spots geothermal nodes between here and the tail that will keep you warm during the freeze-over . You must reach one of these hot spots each evening before nightfall . Is that understood ? Copy . Standard operating procedure until I give you further instructions . Stand by . Dad , are you there ? Hey , Dad , are you there ? Dad you there ? Hello ? I 'm here . A boy I know had this . It 's a real book . From a museum . It 's Moby Dick . He said I could even hold on to it . Hold on to what ? The book , Dad . Did they really kill these whales ? We , Senshi , for their oil and they almost disappeared . Just before the age of carbon fuels . Where 's your brother ? Kit . Hey . Dad , are you there ? I 'm here . Where are you ? My suit 's turned black . I like it , but I think it 's something bad . Your suit is made of smart fabric . It has motion sensors . I 'm tracking a life form moving toward you from the west . It 's closing rapidly . Fifty meters . Forty . Thirty . Twenty . Ten . It is right there , Kitai . Do not move . Recognize your power . This will be your creation . Stand down , cadet . Kitai ! Control yourself , cadet ! Kitai , stand down ! Get away ! - Get away ! - Kitai ! To your rear . Out to your rear . There 's a river 250 meters straight ahead . Go . They are no longer in pursuit . Cadet , you are not being followed . I repeat , you are not being followed . Kitai , you are running from nothing ! Kitai ! Kitai . Put my damn cutlass away . You are not being followed . Take a knee . Take a knee , cadet ! If you want to die today that is fine , but you are not going to kill me . Kitai , I need you to do a physical assessment . You are showing rapid blood contamination . Are you cut ? - I 'm dizzy . - Kitai , self e-val . - Dad , I can 't stand . - Open your med kit . You are going to have to administer the antitoxin in sequence . Inject yourself with the clear liquid first . Do it now . I can 't see . The poison is affecting your nervous system . Stay even . Dad , please come help me . I can 't see . I can 't do this by myself , Dad . Please come get me . Kitai , inject yourself directly into your heart with the first stage . Do it now . Now the second . ASAP . To your left , Kitai . - Left ! - I can 't feel my hand . Dad , I can 't feel my hands . Press it into the ground . Roll over on it and press it into the ground , Kitai . Great work , cadet . But you are going to have to lie there for a moment . The parasite that stung you has a paralyzing agent in its venom . So you are going to have to lie there for a little bit while the antitoxin does its job . It 's time to wake up . Son . The temperature is dropping five degrees every 10 minutes . You have got to wake up . Can you blink your eyes ? Son . I need you to please blink your eyes . Hey , Dad . Hey . - That sucked . - That is correct . You 've got 9.7 kilometers to the hot spot . How about you show me that 10K in 50 minutes , cadet ? Sir , yes , sir . Ten mikes out . All good . Who wasn 't advanced to Ranger ? Who was it ? Watch him go . Watch him go . Five miles out . Five miles out . Happy 19th birthday , Senshi . Here . Dad , you help me . No , Senshi , you go ahead . You blow . Come on , Dad . Blow . Now , you know there 's no way I can actually do that from here . No . I think you can . Faia , you 're right there . Help the girl . You can do it . I know you can . Hot Spot I 'm arrival . H plus 54 minutes . Equipment check and consolidate . Take your next inhaler . Your oxygen extraction is bottoming . Take your next breathing fluid . Second dose of breathing fluid complete . Count off remaining . Four vials remain , sir . Repeat . Four vials remain , sir . Dad . Dad ! I 'm here . How did you do it ? How did you first ghost ? Out for a run . Alone . Something we 're never supposed to do . Ursa de-camos right in front of me . I go for my cutlass . It shoots its pincer right through my shoulder . Next thing I know , we 're over the cliff , falling 30 meters straight down into the river . We settle onto the bottom . It 's on top of me . But it 's not moving . And I realize he 's trying to drown me . I 'm thinking , " I 'm gonna die . I 'm gonna die . I cannot believe this is how I 'm going to die . " I can see my blood bubbling up , mixing with the sunlight shining through the water . And I think , " Wow that 's really pretty . " And everything slows down . And I see its pincer through my shoulder . And I decide I don 't want that in there anymore . So I pull it out . And he lets me go . And more than that , I can tell it can 't find me . It doesn 't even know where to look . And it dawned on me fear is not real . The only place that fear can exist is in our thoughts of the future . It is a product of our imagination causing us to fear things that do not at present and may not ever exist . That is near insanity , Kitai . Do not misunderstand me . Danger is very real . But fear is a choice . We are all telling ourselves a story . And that day , mine changed . Fourteen kilometers to the falls . That 's our midway checkpoint . I 'm reading you . Kitai , get to the falls ASAP . I hear something . I think it 's water . A lot of it . Inventory up . Roger . Food rations , half available . Flares , full . Med kit , half available . Breathing fluid ... Breathing fluid , four vials available . Why are you not showing me the case ? What ? Show it to me now . I thought that I could make it , sir . Abort mission . Return to the ship . That is an order . Don 't come out . No matter what . That 's an order . Dad ! No , Dad . I can do it . I don 't need many . I can get across with just two . You need a minimum of three inhalers to make it to the tail . You have exhausted your resources . I can get across . I can do it with just two , Dad . This mission has reached abort criteria . I take full responsibility . You did your best . You have nothing more to prove . Now return to the ship . What was your mistake ? Trusting me ? Depending on me , thinking that I could do this ? I am giving you an order to turn around and return to this ship . You wouldn 't give any other Ranger that order ! You are not a Ranger . And I am giving you that order . What was I supposed to do ? What did you want me to do ? She gave me an order ! She said , no matter what , don 't come out of that box ! Was I supposed to just come out and die ? What do you think , cadet ? What do you think you should have done ? Because that is all that matters . What do you think you should have done ? And where were you ? She called out for you ! She called your name ! And you weren 't there , because you 're never there ! And you think I 'm a coward ? You 're wrong ! I 'm not a coward ! You 're the coward ! I 'm not a coward ! Kitai ! Kitai , you 've got incoming . Do you copy ? You 've got incoming . Kitai , dive ! Dive ! Kitai ! No ! Leave them alone ! Get away ! Dad , I 'm sorry . It 's Kitai . Where is my son ? General Cypher Raige . This is a message for my wife . Faia . I have lost contact with our son . End message . You have six vials . At your weight , that should be 20 to 24 hours each . That 's more than enough . I estimate four days to reach the tail . Let 's break it into sections . Six hours to reach the first geothermal site . The first leg , 20K to the mouth of the North Forest . I 'm right here . - I 'm five miles out . - Keep moving . - Hot Spot 1 arrival . - Take your next inhaler . H plus 54 minutes . There is an escarpment . Looks like it could be a waterfall . - We would call that midway point . - I can get across . I can do it with two nights . Fourteen kilometers to the falls . This is us here . That , is the tail . You are going to retrieve that beacon or we are going to die . Leave me alone ! Wake up . It 's time for you to wake up . Hey . Hey . I was just about to come out that day . No , you weren 't . But you did the right thing . Dad says I should have tried . He 's just mad at himself . That 's all . Why couldn 't you ghost ? - You 're close right now . - I am ? Are you scared ? No . I 'm tired . That 's good . You filled your heart with something else . Now you got to get up . - I memorized some of a Moby Dick . - Kitai , get up . - " All that most maddens and torments ... - Kitai , Wake up . - ... all that stirs up of the lees of things ... - Wake up , it 's time all truth with malice in it , all that cracks in sinews ... " Wake up ! Kit ... Hey , thanks . No . Dad . Dad , it 's Kitai . I made it to ... Kitai . Dad , I made it to the tail . Do you copy ? Kitai , I 'm here . - Are you okay ? - Dad , do you read me ? I copy . Dad , I made it to the tail . Do you copy ? Kitai , we have electrical interference . You are in a black zone . I repeat , you are in a black ... Dad , the Ursa is not contained . Please copy . Dad ? I 'm here . I swear to you I 'm here . Take a knee . It is the ionic layer in the atmosphere above your current position . It is causing electrical interference . That is why the beacon is not firing . To your north . The peak . You must fire the beacon from the peak of that mountain . See it , Kitai . Please see it . Good boy . It is a pheromone trigger . He set it to scare you so he can track you . Keep moving . It has found you . Run . Just run , Kitai . Just run . Climb in here , okay ? It won 't be able to smell you . Dad ! Root yourself in this present moment now . Sight , sound , smell . What do you feel ? You 're still in that box . It 's time to come out . - Stand me up . - General . I said , stand me up . Watch his back . Dad ? Yeah ? I want to work with Mom . Me too .

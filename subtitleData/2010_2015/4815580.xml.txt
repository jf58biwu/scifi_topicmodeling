 Tibburon ! I know it 's you . Show yourself ! Tibburon ! Where are you , huh ? It 's tiburon . Get me out of these chains . And you called me to a peace conference and then tried to kill me . That 's your own fault , tiburon . You buried what the cartel built for years . They found you , and they 'll find you again . They 're never gonna stop hunting you . If I was you , I 'd get my house in order . You know the game ? I 'm not playing your game . I 'll face my death like a man . Well , you 've got 15 seconds . No . No , no , no , no . No . No . No . F ... 15 seconds . 12 seconds . Seven seconds . Five seconds . 3 ... 2 ... 1 . Too late . Not very manly . Yes , the other case is pushed to 10 : 30 , I believe , so we 're gonna be good on time . Thanks again . Brian ? Brian ? I didn 't do a thing . We don 't give a shit . I- - Thank you . Wh--hey ! No , seriously . Yeah . Look , fax over the documents , and I 'll get it to you back later today . No , no , it 's good . Good . That 's gonna work . I 'm telling you . I know this guy . I know her . It 's gonna be all right . It 's really not a problem . Mr. holt . What--Jack , I 'll call you back . Hey ... Are you okay ? Who are you ? I 'm Cal . Are you all right ? Where are we ? I don 't know . None of you are here by chance . You 're here ... Because of your actions . Do you always drug and shackle your guests ? Shh , shh , shh . Be quiet . It 's about to begin . We 're about ... To play a game ... Of life and death . Whoever you think I am ... Whatever you think I did , there 's no way that I deserve to die . Wait . No . No ! No ! Oh , my God ! No . Pups . Some bull , some blue , some ... Threshers . And the thing about the sharks is they 're- - they 're only- - they 're only babies . They 're only less than two months old , but far more sophisticated and independent than humans 20 times their age . That 's the thing about sharks . Heh . They enter the world prepared for the world because of 20 million years of evolution . They 're just garbage cans of the sea . No . No . They 're--they 're predatory perfection . They don 't sleep . They don 't retreat . They don 't get fatigued or ill . They swim , and they feed , and they mate . Sharks are life . They 're the oldest and purest forms of being on this world . They 're gods . They should be revered . So that 's how it 's gonna be ? You 're gonna feed us to baby sharks ? The thing is ... This pool is a gateway , and the pups are sentinels . If you can enter , you can get to a pathway ... And your challenge is to move along that pathway from this side of the island to the other . Yeah , well , what 's the catch ? Oh , there 's no catch , no catch , no catch whatsoever . There are a few challenges along the way , but each day , you 're going to encounter another different kind of species of shark . If you kill that shark ... I , being the kind man that I am , will , uh , give you a reward to survive the next shark , but only , only a bit . You 're sick . Do not say that again , or ... I 'll cut out your tongue . If you wanted to kill us , why 'd you bring us here ? Why didn 't you just do it when you had the chance ? Revenge ... Is like a fine wine . If you have it , why not linger over it ? If you play , you might live . If you refuse ... You are guaranteed a death . How 's that for motivation ? Oh , you 'll be tempted to swim straight for the escape hatch , and that is not in your best interest . See , one of the pups is wearing a collar with the key around it , so find the puppy . Find the puppy . - No ! - No ! No ! - No ! - Don 't ! Don 't ! No , you son of a bitch ! No ! Look for the key ! They 're everywhere ! - Where is it ? ! - I don 't know ! They 're eating me alive ! They 're not dangerous . Just bat ' em away . I got it ! I think he 's got the key . Swim towards the gate . Come on ! Hurry ! Open it ! Francine ! Swim ! Go next , ragan . Hmm . They all made it through . Okay , okay . Where are we ? We made it to the beach . No , I think it 's just a sand barge . Make room . What do we do now ? We 've gotta swim to shore . I 'm not getting back in that water until daylight . Well , that shouldn 't be much longer . Let 's just try to rest here until daybreak . Oh , God . What--baby , what are you talking about ? You- - I want to stay . Leave me . No . Come on , sweet tibu . Let me just watch . You know how I love to watch . This is not a game ! If you don 't leave me , I might feed you to the sharks as well ! Asshole . Good morning , everyone . I hope you slept well . We have an exciting day ahead of us . Jesus Christ ! Better get used to it . How can you be so flippant ? We 're pawns in this psycho 's game . Well , how the hell do you expect me to act , lady ? Hysterical ? How 's that gonna help things ? Enough ! Is everyone okay ? They got me all over . They got all of us . Is anyone badly hurt ? No . I 'll live . Yeah , but for how long ? All right , down to business . Let me see that . Oh , my God . The key unlocks our handcuffs . Thanks . Hey . Who is that lunatic ? You 're here now . Playing stupid ain 't gonna help you . He 's Ethan McKay , aka tiburon . You mean that drug trafficker ? But what that 's gotta do with me ? I 'm an EMT . What are we gonna do ? I don 't want to die . Don 't know about the rest of you guys . I 'm gonna be just fine . You don 't know that . I do know that . I planned . I 'm prepared . Prepared for what ? It 's my business . What kind of business is that ? None of yours . I don 't pay for the best k-and-r for nothing . What 's k-and-r ? It 's kidnap and ransom insurance . Look , I have an rfid chip in my shoulder , and right now , securecorps' armed response team is knocking on tiburon 's front door . - Hey , buddy . - It 's holt . You 're bleeding from your shoulder . Hold still . I don 't see any sort of object in there . I 'm betting your rfid chip is on a plane halfway to Seattle by now . What do you know ? They 'll find me . That 's what I pay them for . Why do you have kidnapping insurance ? Why do you ask so many damn questions ? It 's my job . That 's where I know you from . You 're on that TV show , hit ' em hard , right ? Pete , would you mind taking a look at my leg ? Yeah , of course . Let 's go sit over there . I 'm Francine , by the way . Sorry , Francine . Holt , you 've got a bite on your leg , too . So where do we go now ? We can 't go backwards , so we start going forwards . All right . Well , everyone hold on to their shackles . We could use every resource that we have . Look , we need to start thinking ahead if we 're gonna survive this sick game . You are way too calm and know way too much . Who are you ? Ancient Hawaiians used to drown sharks . How do you drown a fish ? Well , sharks breathe by moving forward to push water through their mouths and over their gills , so if you can stop it from moving , you can drown it . Yeah . Yeah , that 's right . Or we could pull it backwards . That 'll work , too . All right , everyone , grab your shackles . You , too . Where are we going ? Inland . Let 's find somewhere to rest . Let 's find a place to hide . He can 't kill us if he can 't find us . Tiburon 's got cameras everywhere and booby traps to make sure we don 't stay in one place . Frankie 's right . The only way out is to follow the path . If we don 't , tiburon will find a way to kill us for sure . What is it ? Yeah . Locked . Should have known . Hey , Cal , where 's that key ? Ah , shoot . Combination locks . Should have known . Let me see that . Maybe we can pry it open . No , don 't . You 'll break the key . Yeah , Cal 's right , sweetie . We don 't know if we 're gonna need this again . Yeah , like right now . What is it ? Try this . 5-4-1-2-6-0 . Good eye , Francine . Yeah . Ohh . First-aid kit , ladies ? Friend . Swarming around the food like pups . Well , you 're about to meet the mama . I can 't go back in the water . I 'm just gonna sit here and die . Layla , you- - you 've gotta calm down . Look , securecorps knows I 'm missing . I don 't care where that chip is . If it 's not at my desk at the federal building ... It will trigger a search . The federal building , huh ? I work at the federal building . I 'm a judge . I 'm a federal prosecutor . I 'd say we acquire some pretty dangerous enemies . You guys busted him , didn 't you ? No . Busted his son , junior . That 's right . He was killed in bedel canyon . I was there . This is starting to make sense . What did you do ? I was one of the undercover cops . Did you shoot him ? Lot of people shot him . No . Pete , what 's wrong ? It 's--it 's his son . I treated him . Well , at least I tried to , but he was already dead when I got there . There wasn 't anything that I could do for him . I signed the warrant . I put the case together . We outsmarted his son . We can outsmart him . If we don 't play along , he 'll kill us for sure . If we do , we might find a way to beat him at his own game . Okay . Let 's keep moving , then . The quicker we move , the sooner this game will be over . I thought I saw a trail head back this way . Come on , Layla . Who put you in charge , huh ? Picking fights isn 't going to solve anything . You save that psychobabble for somebody else . I don 't care about your feelings . I just need you to shut up and let me figure this out . It 's not just the sharks that are gonna get us killed . Shark 's blood . To hunger and vengeance . Come on , baby . You 're having all the fun . Can 't I just watch ? It 's time to chum the water . Ah , man . If we stay out of the water , we 'll be fine , right ? I mean , no water , no sharks , right ? It can 't be that easy . All right ? Tiburon 's crazy , but he 's not stupid . If he wants us in the water , we 're going in the water . What the hell ? ! Everybody get back to back ! Keep your eyes open . The door you see is your exit . The locked door , that is . Question is , " where is the key ? " There 's- - there 's no keyhole ... No lock . There 's- - there 's nothing . Can any of you tell me why ... The majority of shark attacks take place in three feet of water ? Shh . Don 't answer him . We may have to play along , but we do not have to entertain him . Okay . We 're all intelligent people . But I 'll tell you . The majority of shark attacks take place in three feet of water because that is where the food is . The exact amount of water you are standing in . Everyone give me your shackles . We 're gonna connect ' em . We 're gonna make a noose . Oh . You 're gonna drown a shark ? We are . Francine , ragan , scan the water . Holt , you and I are gonna loop this around the shark 's tail . Pete and I 'll grab the end and pull it back . What should I do ? Be quiet . Don 't die . Keep your eyes on the water , any ripple , any movement . Hammerheads ... Are bottom swimmers , and because of the placement of their eyes , they are always looking up . That 's why you never know where they are till it 's too late . Any second now . - Pete ! - Pete ! - Oh , my God ! - The hell with this ! Pete , hang on ! Get the tail ! Oh , my God ! - Pete ! - Pete ! It got him ! Get him ! - Pete ! - Hell with this ! Pete ! Pete , hang on , man ! I 'm gonna tie the noose around the shark 's tail . Yeah ! Come on ! - Be careful , Cal ! - Oh , my God ! Help me move the shark backwards . - Pull ! Pull ! - Pull ! - I got it . - Is he dead ? Pull it ! - Aah ! - Pull ! Pull ! - Get it off me ! - No ! He 's dying ! - Pull ! - Pull ! The shark is slowing down . I think it 's drowning . - Pull it ! - Pull it ! Oh , my God . Is it dead ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Hmph . He was innocent ! He didn 't kill your son ! He tried to save him ! Are you defending yourself or him , detective ? Doesn 't matter . You 'll get your turn . You all will . - All right . - All right . Can we get out of here now ? Let 's get out of here . Yeah , let 's go . Oh , God . We need more food and water . There 's got to be another container somewhere . Amazing . It 's not just the sharks that can learn . Hope they don 't learn too fast . That was even more exciting than I expected . Heh . I 'm gonna see if I can find something to crack ' em open with . Do we trust him to go on a search alone ? Yeah , what if he 's helping tiburon ? You know , it seems like he knows more about why we 're here than we do . - What 's the difference ? - You can go with him if you 'd like , but I 'm fine right here . Yeah . Me , too . Yeah , me , too . I 'm fine here , too . Look , now we know what to expect . We just have to outsmart the shark before it gets one of us . Hah ! Easier said than done . We have to strike before the shark does . That 's just stupid . Where the hell did you find a knife ? You working with them ? What ? No . I don 't work for tiburon anymore . I 'm just as screwed as the rest of you all . I found this knife sticking out of a tree back there . You know him ? Get us out of here . Look , if I can 't get out , nobody can . Give me the knife . What did you have to do with his son 's death ? Look , lady , I don 't have to tell you anything . And you 're not getting the knife . Okay , listen . I know we 're all scared here , but we 're gonna have to work as a team . We have a weapon now . We can fight back . Hey , there 's seven of us and just one of him . Wouldn 't it be easier to fight tiburon than the sharks ? What ? Do you really think you could fight him ? Do you really think it 's just tiburon and Elena on this island ? Tiburon has an entire army at his disposal . Then why don 't you tell us what you 're doing here ? What are you hiding ? What 'd you do to his son ? Nothing ! I loved the kid like a brother . I would never hurt him ! All right . Whatever you say , man . Frankie , you need to chill out . Would you at least be willing to use your knife to cut down some of those sticks over there ? We could sharpen ' em . At least we 'd all have a weapon . Yeah . I can do that . Good luck piercing the thick skin of a shark with pointy sticks . We have one knife and a bunch of sticks against a shark . We 're dead , all of us . You can 't talk like that . We killed one shark . We can kill another one , especially now that we 're more prepared . The hammerhead isn 't even the toughest of the sharks . What if we would have come up against something worse ? We can 't kill all of them . We 're already dead . Take it then . What ? Use it to cut your wrists . Why would I do that ? 'Cause , man , you keep talking about it , you 're gonna be nothing but a burden on the rest of us . I get what you 're doing , but , no , thanks . Take your knife . So what 's our plan ? I guess we start with what we know about sharks . They can hear your heartbeat . And they have heightened perceptions . Blood , movement , they 're attracted to those things . You know , I just thought of something . I must have seen it on TV , a nature channel or something , but there was this guy . He was swimming with sharks , and he would touch them in this spot on the receptors . He would just pet them a couple of times , a-and then they would go into this trance . They would roll belly-up and be out cold for a few minutes . You want to hypnotize a shark ? That 's your big plan , Francine ? No , what I 'm saying is if touching them in that spot puts them into a sleep , maybe stabbing them would be a pretty damn good way to kill them . But it 's gotta be a punch . It 's gotta be hard , because the shark 's skin is so thick , and we have just sticks . Maybe the eye . Yeah , the eyes are good , but it 's only fatal if you get to the brain . There 's a better route to that . Just right over the top . That doesn 't make any sense . If you 're close enough to stab it , you 're close enough to get bitten . You know what ? I 'm not doing it . Look , if you 're not going to help us plan , then keep your mouth shut . This is a conversation we need to have , but we don 't need to have it right this second . It 's been a hell of a day . But , uh , in the end , it comes down to that moment , and for that , you need a clear head and all the strength you can muster . If we want to get through this , if we want to live , we have to be focused . Cal 's right . We keep walking in circles , we 'll be useless . I have a plan . Maybe we can distract the shark . How do you distract a shark ? With a heartbeat and blood . What are you saying ? I 'm a bad person . I 'm not like all of you . I deserve to be here . I deserve to die . Feed me to the shark while you guys escape . That 's not true . No one deserves this . But it 'll work . We won 't let you do that . We 're gonna stick together , and we 're gonna get out of this alive . Mind if I borrow that knife for a second ? Thanks . Hey , where you going with the knife ? I 'm going to get some shark 's teeth . You need a hand ? Nope . I got it . Sorry . What does he think he 's gonna be able to do with shark 's teeth ? They 're sharp . That 's a weapon . Are you serious ? As a heart attack . You want one ? No , but I 'll take my knife back . Yeah , give me one . What the hell , right ? Fine . Who else wants one ? Take it . Maybe we can tie the shark tooth to the stick and make a spear . I can 't sleep . Just try , sweetie . Close your eyes . Can 't sleep either ? No . Can 't get my mind to be quiet . Too many questions without any answers . Yeah . Know what you mean . What about the others ? Well , I think it 's pretty hard to sleep out here with the sun blazing , but everyone 's giving it a try . They seem peaceful , huh ? All things considered . I 'm just trying not to lose my mind , honestly . Whatever 's left of it . There you are . Been looking all over for you . Thanks . You 're welcome . Good morning . Time to get up . We have so many fun activities planned . Follow the marked path down the hill into the caves . Thirsty . We should have brought coconuts . We 'll find some more . We have been drugged and kidnapped by a maniac making us fight a different shark every day . You 'd be lucky if you die of thirst . So what do you think it 'll be this time ? The trap , or the shark ? Oh , God . I meant the trap , but now I mean both . There 's no way of knowing , and nothing we could do even if we did . Just keep your eyes open . Tiburon could spring it on us at any moment . As long as Frankie 's got that knife , we got a chance . Let 's keep moving . There it is . Jesus . Look at the size of that thing . Looks like round two . This is not good . Stay calm . - How the hell am I supposed to do that ? - Try ! Listen , guys , we 've got our Spears to fight this thing . What else have we got ? I got a knife . I got the wire . Okay . Frankie , knife . What are you doing ? Something stupid . What the hell ? I 'm with stupid . Oh , hell . - What are you guys doing ? - No ! Stop ! Don 't do it ! Hang on , cowboy . - Did it work ? Come on , holt . - Nothing . It 's not working . Come on , Layla . Throw something . Francine ! Oh , my God ! What the hell ? Am I too late ? Oh , you 're never too late , darling . Where is it ? Where are they ? Cal ! Francine ? Come on . She 's gone . What 's happening ? A new day . Let 's see if we can find some food , whatever else tiburon has left for us . Hey , guys , it 's a boat ! It 's a boat . Told you they were coming for me . Do you really think tiburon is gonna leave us a boat ? Only if he left us a shark in it . Let 's check it . Maybe there 's a cellphone or a flare gun or something . And we 'll push it in the water . We can get off this island , guys . See anything ? It 's full of holes . Never gonna get off this island . We need to keep moving . Even if we could get this thing in the water , this thing 's not gonna float . We can 't go that way . Then we 'd just be going in circles . Stop ! Uh-oh . It 's a mine . There is no way we 're going through that minefield . It 's okay . We 're gonna make it . It 's not okay . None of this is okay . If I go , I 'm dead , and if I stay , I 'm dead . You don 't want to go , fine . Then go back , and have one of tiburon 's men finish you off . Well , then you go first , then . - Fine . Maybe I will go first . - Calm down . This doesn 't help our situation . It 'd make me feel better if you went first . Shut up ! It 's all right . Just follow me . Step lightly . Here . Uh-oh . Cal . Yeah ? Can 't move . What ? I can 't move my leg . The rest of you keep moving slowly . How you doing ? Terrified . How do you think I 'm doing ? What are we gonna do ? Give me a few seconds to think about it . How many you need ? - 3 ... - Okay . - 2 ... - No , no , no , no , no , no . No , Jesus . Jesus Christ . Run ! Hmm . I don 't get it . This is all about his son . You were at bedel canyon . I don 't know about you two . Yeah , when I was researching the story , I didn 't see either of your names . I was supposed to be at bedel canyon , not junior . Like I said earlier , he was like family to me . I was out getting shitfaced drunk that night , and junior covered me . Well , that explains it . Junior was not supposed to be there that night . Thought we caught a lucky break . When he showed up to make the buy , we couldn 't believe it . And it all went to hell , and he got shot . Wasn 't supposed to go like that . What about you ? What can I say ? I 'm a junkie . I went to go buy some stuff one night . They asked me if I knew junior , and I told them what they wanted to hear . I just told them so I can get out of there . Congratulations . You 've connected the dots . Now off to the next shark that awaits you . That 's the biggest fish I 've ever seen . It 's not even the tiger shark 's size that is its most intimidating attribute . Tiger sharks , more so than any others , truly have a taste for humans . They crave us . They will actually swim in fresh water just to get us . If there was ever an man-eater ... It 's the tiger shark . We can 't go in with that monster . We gotta find a way around the side . Around the side ? Where are we gonna go around the side ? Is it even worth trying anymore ? Look at this . I have an idea . I can 't wait to see what it is . Cal , what you got planned ? I need you guys to link arms with me and hold me up over the water . Layla , hold this . Holt , come on . Cal , what are you doing ? I 'm gonna feed the fish . Almost . Got you . You 're not gonna make it , Cal . We need another person . Layla ? I 'm the smallest and lightest . Are you sure ? No . They 'll kill themselves before the sharks get the chance . Maybe . Little more . Oh , my God ! Layla ! - Layla ! - Layla ! We gotta help her . Layla ! Layla ! No ! Layla , hold on ! - Hold on ! - Help me ! Help me ! - Come on ! - Come on , swim ! Come on ! You can do it ! You can do it . Swim to the exit . - Where 'd it go ? - Come on ! Help me ! Come on , Layla . You could do this . - Go ! - Hang on ! Yeah , come on . Swim over to the exit . Come on . You can make it ! Come on ! You can do it ! - You can make it . - Swim ! Come on . Come on . Come on , Layla ! - Come on . - Come on , Layla . Come on ! Shit . Come on . Don 't give in . Come on . Swim over to the exit . Come on . Come on . Don 't give up . - Layla , hold on . - Come on ! Come on , Layla ! Swim ! Don 't give up . Come on . It 's coming for you . - Hurry ! Hurry ! - Go ! Swim ! Get out of there ! Get out of there ! No . Just go . You can make it . Come on . Go ! Layla ! Layla . You did good . We gotta keep moving . You 're making it too easy . I thought the whole point was to let the sharks just rip them apart . Everyone needs hope , Elena , my bloodthirsty Elena . Even if it is false . Hey , wait . I see something , guys . Look , guys . I got it . It 's a harpoon . So this is our next trap . Think of it as our next chance to escape . I 'm too old to play pretend . You 're almost at the finish line . If you pass this challenge , you will be rewarded with a boat . We really believe him ? Do you want to wait and find out ? Listen , we 've gotta assume what he says is true . You know what we have to go do . Anyone want Sushi ? Frankie , wait ! Frankie ! Come on , holt . Come on ! Where are you , you son of a bitch ? ! Oh , there it is , Cal ! Come on , Cal ! Stab him ! Cal ! No ! Aah ! It got my leg ! Frankie ! Frankie , hold on ! Frankie ! No ! Frankie . Ragan ! Holt ! Come on ! You okay ? Yeah . Well , you know what they say . You mess with the bull ... You get the horns . You all right ? Yeah . It 's like a vacation . I 'm serious . How you holding up ? I don 't want to die . I 'm not gonna let that happen . How can you say that ? Promise . And now ... We come to the final act . You know , if it wasn 't so terrifying , it 'd be beautiful . Well , the real beauty is waiting in the water . As always , the best must be saved for last . It 's gonna be all right . How ? The great white shark . The fiercest , strongest ... And the apex predator on the planet . You really can 't give up , can you , Cal ? I guess that 's what you 're built for , hmm ? It 's admirable , but it will do you no good here . Face it . No . Not me . No tricks this time . No traps this time . The great white is the ultimate obstacle . Get out of the water , that 's it . You win . Hey , we can make it . But not together . W-what are you doing ? We go in together , we die together . But if one of us can distract the shark long enough , the other can get to shore . Distract the shark ? But th-that 's suicide . Probably , but if I can distract it long enough , then you can get to shore . What ? N-no . No , you can 't do that . No . We have to face it . But I need you to get to shore . I promised you 're gonna live . I 'll get to the shore , and then I 'll distract the shark so you can come over . That 's the plan . There ! Cal ! No ! Ragan . Ragan . I got it . You did ? Is it really dead ? Yeah . I really killed it . Let 's get out of here . Oh , God . - Ohh ! - Ahh ! Ragan ! Cal ! Ragan ! Ahh ! Come on ! Cal ! Cal ! Bitch ! See , I- - I can 't let you leave the island . I won 't let you . If I 'm not leaving , neither are you . God ! Yaah ! Bitch ! See ? Heh . Tiburon likes drama . But I told him it would be a lot more easier if I put a bullet in your vapid little head . Oh , sh ... The game 's over , tiburon . Ah . So the last man standing is a woman . Well done , ragan . You 're not getting off of this island alive . Who 's going to stop me ? I will . I already killed your whore . Ah ... Elena . But whores are replaceable . You 're not gonna get the chance . You people ... Killed my son , my only pride and joy . I said I would have revenge , and I did ! It 's over ! Tell me where we are ! You 're 100 Miles South of key west . International waters . You know what that means , don 't you ? I 've got a yacht in my harbor , several . You can take one . You 've earned your freedom . That 's not what I want anymore .

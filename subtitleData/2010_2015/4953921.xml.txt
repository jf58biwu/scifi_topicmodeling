 ( EARPIECE BUZZING ) ( BEEPING ) MR BIG : Hello , Mai . Why did you pick this freezing hole ? Payback . Remember that sauna you chose last time ? You gonna hide back there all day ? You wish . Boy , you really hold a grudge . What the hell is that ? That 'll be my victory . That was close . Hey , does your mother know you 're wearing her coat ? It was a gift . Oh ... Ouch . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( MR BIG GROANING ) I 'm just going to lay here for a second . You do that . ( BEEPING ) Oh , God . ( EXCLAIMS ) Shit ! You got to be kidding me . Excuse me , you wouldn 't have happened to have seen my date , would you ? No , but I could try to help you find her ifyou want . You 're late . Sorry . You were called in ? - Ten minutes ago . - And ? I 'm going on to the next round . Mai , I 'm so proud ofyou . Let 's skip the party . No , no , no , no . You said we were late . Invitation card , please . Excuse me ? Sorry , Mr Yagami . You don 't need an invitation . ( CHUCKLES ) I think we just lost camera seven . Do you know where l was stationed before this ? Afghanistan . That 's right , Afghanistan . Million dollar surveillance equipment sent to the hills of Tora Bora , thousands of miles away from civilisation . Anything I wanted was a phone call away . So could somebody please tell me how I can be in the most technologically advanced country in the world and not get one decent surveillance camera ? I don 't ... Don 't all answer at once . lori , I 'm so glad you could finally make it . I am so sorry we 're late . Chizuru , this is Mai Shiranui . It 's so wonderful to finally meet you . I understand congratulations are in order . Well , thank you very much . You 've come a long way this past year . I can 't remember when we 've had a fighter quite so driven . Well , now that you 're here , I guess we can begin . Truth be told , I 'm a little nervous . What 's going on ? Well , these artefacts have never been displayed like this . Well then , why risk it ? If anything should happen ... Takao Iwata insisted . He 's in financial control of the tournament , and it 's no secret he likes to show off . I lust have to make sure the security we 've put in place is adequate . Does she know about our cameras ? I don 't think so , but ... Thank you . Wow . Look at you . The way they treat you , you 'd think you were the King of Fighters . I 've been retired way too long . I 've been invited because I 'm the last of the Yagami clan . You never told me why you retired so early . It 's complicated . Well , you 're a complicated guy , lori . I wouldn 't expect it to be simple . Another time . - Promise ? - l will . Hey , that 's not a promise . I will . Come on . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , Mr Iwata . Please , follow me . Come with me . Come on . Best seats in the house . There they are , the treasures of the clans . These make the King of Fighters tournament possible . ( PHONE RINGING ) You need to take that ? No , I don 't . You have my full attention tonight , I 'm sorry . Sit down . Well , the secret of the treasures are meant to be kept within the clans . Oh ... But I can tell you a little . Okay . The Yasakani no Magatama was created by my ancestors almost 2 , OOO years ago . At that time , the necklace possessed the energy to unlock the door . It 's the key . The Yata mirror is the door , and it was the Yata clan who first created the mirror . Chizuru is the last descendant of that clan . And do you remember what happens when you direct the energy of the necklace into the shield ? You unlock the passageway to the other dimension . Exactly . But I still don 't understand. I mean , you have a necklace and a mirror . It 's not logical . How ? Miss Logical , I forgot . lori , we 're using earpieces . I mean , how does that even happen ? Look , I know it doesn 't look like much , but that 's the point . Chizuru 's father was a genius , and he was able to consolidate the existing energy waves from these artefacts and condense them into the earpieces we 're using today . Now , at the push of a button , we 're able to enter another dimension . Wow . I know , it 's crazy . Well , what about that third one ? It 's the Kusanagi sword , the most important of the treasures . Only the sword can defeat the Orochi . What is that ? The Orochi is a spirit , or a demon , that was banished to the dimension 1,800 years ago . Legend has it promising unlimited power to anyone that frees it , but he would have to possess all three treasures to do so . What would happen if he was freed ? That 's a lesson for another day when you 're ready . Hopefully soon . I 'm looking to do more. I think I need to . Go ! Go ! Go , go , go , go ! Let 's get a closer look , okay ? ( DOOR OPENS ) - What ? Who is that ? - Come on . Chizuru . How are you , Rugal ? Excuse me . Peek-a-boo . Go ! Now ! Get out now ! Chizuru . - Chizuru ? - She 's hurt bad . Chizuru , look at me , look at me . Where 's Rugal ? He 's down . Don 't worry , relax . The relics . He wants back in . The relics are ... Call for help . We need an ambulance ! Call 911 ! lori ! Come with me . Remember what waits for us on the other side . I can 't , and I can 't let you either . Okay . More for me then . Wouldn 't it be ironic if I was to kill you now with this sword ? Come out with your hands up ! God . Stay down ! Hands above your head ! No , go , go ! It 's the other guy , it 's the other guy . Thanks for the lesson , Chizuru . ( GRUNTS ) - No way out . He 's trapped . - Okay , are there any windows ? Wait ! Back off ! Back off !

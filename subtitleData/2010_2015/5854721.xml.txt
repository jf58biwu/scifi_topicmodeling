 How did you do that ? A magician never reveals his secrets . Then I 'Il have to pierce your shell and gaze within . You understood . Chan Ho Yin . Raina . I would love to see that fire trick again . I don 't think that 's a good idea . Of course not . It 's a great idea . I 'm sorry for the clutter . I 'm in between places . How long have you been here ? Six years . Beer ? You seem to have an appreciation for the greats . I idolized him for many years . And now ? There is no real magic there . Just tricks . And what you do , those aren 't tricks ? Show me . I 'm sorry . I really shouldn 't . Says who ? What are you afraid of ? It 's not me who 's afraid . That can 't be real ? See for yourself . How long have you been able to ... First time was a few years ago . A dish towel caught fire in my hands . I almost burned down my entire apartment . And it doesn 't hurt ? Not even a little . You have a gift . I 've never seen anything like it . Why not show the world ? I ask that same question every day . There are people who ... Never mind . It 's just ... For years , I did illusions . Tricks , like the rest . And then this happens . It 's real . Real magic . If I believed in such things , I would say it was a miracle . That this happened for a reason . I believe you 've been chosen . You do ? Close your eyes , and I 'Il show you . That 'Il do . Every decision you make from here on out has consequences . So be warned . The kiddie gloves are off . SKYE ' . G-7 . Hit . Yes ! Ha ! So explain to me again what this has to do with my training . It 's important for every S.O. to evaluate their student 's thought process . Mmm-hmm . And I like board games . B-10 . Nope . This isn 't thinking . This is stabbing in the dark . But it 's nice to take a break from the workouts . You deserve a break . I gotta give Coulson credit . Never would have pegged an ex-Rising Tide hacker as a good fit , but you 're picking things up pretty fast . Did you just give me a compliment ? I ... No , I made a comment . A kind one . Did it physically hurt to do that ? Do you need an ice pack ? Wow . A compliment and a smile . Comment . I don 't want to ruin the moment , but I 'm gonna have to respond with ... G-4 . Say it , Ward . Say it . - You sank my battleship . - Yes ! - All right , best two out of three . - I beat you ! - Best two out of three . - Best out of one . She 's fitting in nicely . Gloating ? A little . You were up early this morning . Heard you puttering around even before I started tai chi . Having trouble sleeping ? No , I feel great . Just have a little extra energy to burn . If you want , I could lay out the mats downstairs . We could go a few rounds . Like the old days . Saved by the bell . Chan Ho Yin . Just a struggling street performer until a few years ago when Mr. Chan began to exhibit moderate pyrokinetic abilities . So what gave him powers ? It 's still under investigation , but Chan did live near the decommissioned Wan Tai nuclear plant when it caught fire . To our knowledge , no other nearby residents have exhibited similar traits . So how did we find out about him ? Informant saw him lighting torches in a street show . With his pinky . Brought it to S.H.l.E.L.D. ' s attention . We told him to keep his abilities under wraps . - He 's been on the Index ever since . - The Index ? It 's a list S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps of people and objects with powers . Wait , what ? How many are there ? - Are you saying there more people ... - Not many . Well , enough to keep a list . A short list . Meant to protect them . Though in rare cases , S.H.I.E.L.D. has had to take action . Action against objects or people ? Well , that 's drastic with a side of creepy . How are they monitored ? Tapped phones ? Satellite surveillance ? Body probes in dark , unpleasant places ? Body probes ? Now that 's ridiculous . S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn 't do that . We don 't do that , do we ? The methods vary . Mr. Chan was low risk . He was assigned a case agent who checked in with him every few days . That 's how we discovered him missing . Everyone , this is Agent Kwan , Chan Ho Yin 's case agent . What can you tell us ? Not much , I 'm afraid . Chan is a magician , so , at first , I thought he 'd made himself disappear . The file says you 'd caught him violating his Index agreement before . On two separate occasions . Claimed we were " hampering his artistic expression . " But late last night , he was taken by professionals . The only thing they left behind was this scrap of aluminized material . Fire-proof clothing . So whoever took him knew about his power . Yes . We think we know why . In the last few days , tech division discovered a crack into our data stream . It 's the same cyberpunks who hacked us before . Somehow they got in again . It 's the Rising Tide . Hello ? It got real quiet . - You guys still there ? The Rising Tide is a huge organization of hacktivists from all around the world . Any of them could 've done this . It wasn 't me . - No one 's saying it was . - But you 're thinking it . I can see your faces thinking it . We 're assessing the situation . Then I 'm sure you 're taking into account that I have been living on a plane with you this whole time . It would be impossible for me to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. Or easier . We 're gonna need more than that . Fine . Let me trace the hack , and I 'Il prove it . I believe her , sir . And if she 's telling the truth , we need to track down the person responsible . Dig up something , and fast . The longer Mr. Chan 's missing , the more danger he 's in . Good morning , Chan . What the hell ? I apologize for last night . It was important I bring you in under the radar . Oh . S.H.l.E.L.D. Tell Agent Kwan I don 't need to be read the Power Protocols again . It was just a street performance . It 's not like I set anyone on fire . I don 't work for S.H.l.E.L.D. I come as a friend . English isn 't my first language , but that word means something different than you think . I understand your frustration . But I believe you have a gift . And if you let me , I 'd like to help you nurture it . I can increase it . You 'Il get people 's attention then . Increase my power ? Why ? What 's the catch ? I 'd like to run some tests . There it is . Now , will you let me go , or must I fight my way out ? Leave now , and I 'Il forget you . I promise . But so will everyone else . Stay and you can be remembered . Known the world over . You want to make Chan Ho Yin a famous name ? No , you need a simpler name , a more powerful name . A name like " Scorch . " " Scorch ? " Are you joking ? Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers ? No . But Captain America , now , he 's on the news , and a lunchbox , and a poster on the wall . I don 't want to be a superhero . You want to be recognized for your gift . And who is more recognizable than them ? I was given this power for a reason . I just want people to see what I can do . They will . All I want is what you want . For you to be remembered . To be seen for what you 're meant to be . A star . Scorch ? It 's growing on me . - How close are we ? - Almost there . She 's identified the remote access Trojan - and the infected endpoint . - Yeah , and is searching for a TCP to correlate a hypertext with signature information , - and then , voila ' ! - Bob is your uncle . - You get any of that ? - Only the uncle part . We got our origin . Austin , Texas . You got a name ? Just the café our hacker worked out of , but I 'm in the system . I 'm gonna check to see if any credit card charges from that day match up with any known hackers . We got a hit . Miles Lydon . Not Skye . - That 's to all of our relief . - You know him ? Every hacker in the world knows him . Not just the hacker world . He infiltrated the Kremlin . Yeah , the picture of Putin shirtless on horseback , that was his hack . It was also his hack that got Chan kidnapped . May , set a course for Austin . - Just did . - What about Chan ? Kwan 's got a S.H.l.E.L.D. team on the ground . Our best bet is to chase this thing from the other end . Find Mr. Lydon , bring him in , see what he knows . Just left the café where Miles logged in . Cashier says she hasn 't seen him in over a week . I may have eyes on him . I 've been made . Heading East on 5th Street . Target is now in a silver Jetta . I got him . All right , suit , you asked for it . Gridlock Protocol . I lost him . Are you sure they 're not following you ? Yeah , had to pull out all the stops though . Thanks for the text . Wait , are you mad ? Are you kidding me ? I don 't have much time . Who did you leak those files to ? Wait a second , what ? " Good to see you , too , Miles . " I released them into the world where they belong . They 'Il keep hunting you unless they have someone else to look for . And why the hell would you hack S.H.l.E.L.D. ? Because that 's what we do . Not when I 'm on the inside . You could have ruined everything , you dumb-ass . Seems like you handled it . I 've come too far for you to ... Why are looking at me like that ? Did you just call me " dumb-ass " ? Stop smiling. I 'm serious . Because I taught you everything you know , - so what does that make you ? - No , you didn 't . I 'm sorry. I can 't help it . I 've been missing you like crazy . That 's where you keep that , huh ? Better safe than busted . Making any progress on that ? Digging , but your little stunt is gonna make it harder . Where 's my top ? You know , I could be helping you . If you send me ciphertext , I can be working on algorithms ... No , I can 't contact you . I never should have . There 's a S.H.l.E.L.D. team looking for you right now . My team . And if they suspect something , I 'm screwed . There 's a joke here . That I 'm resisting . That involves the word " screwed . " Shut up . There 's a guy in trouble because of you , and I got to get back . So if you want to help me , help me find my clothes . Hey . I 'm sorry , Skye . Really , I am , if I messed anything up . I 've missed you . Me , too . But we talked about this when I left for L.A. I 've got a chance here . So S.H.l.E.L.D. is Off limits . - Okay ? - Okay . At least tell me what it 's like . Come on , the belly of the beast . Surprisingly un-beastly . I 've got good people I 'm working with . Some good stories though , I hope . Miles . You have no idea . But that 's classified . You did not just say that to me . Come on , you got to tell me something . Someday . Well , if they ever let you go on leave or whatever , let me know , and I 'Il get us a suite at the ... Fancy hotel that has suites . And you can regale me with stories while naked . A suite ? You ? That 's funny . But they 're never gonna let me go on anything if I don 't find my stupid ... Top . Get dressed . I know how this looks ... How long have you two been in contact ? I contacted him once the day I joined to tell him I was okay and once earlier today . When you tipped off an active suspect ? No , it 's not like that . Miles and I , we met when we were both a little screwed up . Scratch that . He was a little screwed up . I was a lot . But we looked after one another . That 's why I warned him . Not because we 're working together on this , but because we 're friends . I 'm really sorry . Noted . If not you , then who is Mr. Lydon working with ? No one . He 's an idealist . Believes in freedom of information . That information cost a man his freedom , and you sabotaged our attempts to remedy that . No , I came here to find out what Miles knows about Chan . - And ? - Nothing . Miles is a dead end . He 's harmless . We 'Il see . Really. I was gonna find out everything I could to try to help . I felt like I couldn 't tell you guys everything . I know . That 's why I asked May to follow you . Seems that wasn 't a dead end . Why would Skye do this to us for him ? I thought she was our friend . I think she is , Fitz . He 's just obviously more than that . Yeah , but we 've been through so much together , and she didn 't even tell us that she has a guy . Well , who knows what they 've been through together ? The classified information you stole from us , who did you give it to ? It 's information . It has a life of its own . What happened to Mr. Chan ? I don 't know who that is . So why don 't you tell me ? So are you guys just gonna destroy all my stuff ? Yes . Anything ? I don 't have to talk to ... Take him in . Gather all the evidence and secure the prisoners . We got what we were looking for here . We 're going to Hong Kong . I 'm so sorry , Ward . This is not what it looks like ... Hands . Now get up . Uh , you missed a button. I 'm sorry . What is this big place , Raina ? And who are these guys ? They 'Il assist you with anything you need . We 're here to monitor your vitals while we observe your powers . And it 's big because we 'Il need the space . This serum strengthens the cytoskeleton within each cell of your body . One dose , and you 'Il feel incredible until it wears off . - And it will wear off ? - Yes . But the effects in average subjects has been impressive . In you , I 'm excited to see . What do you think of the name " Scorch " ? Breathe . Feel it ? Now let 's see what you can do . Whoa . Oh , sorry , you almost got scorched . This is incredible ! Whoo ! You are a beautiful angel , you know that ? Your power is an amazing gift . And S.H.l.E.L.D. wouldn 't let me use it . But thanks to you , the whole world can finally see what I can do . From now on , nobody holds me back . So I guess due process isn 't really S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . They don 't have time for it . Whoa , are you defending them ? These people are denying our basic rights ! This isn 't about us ! They 're trying to save someone 's life . Listen to yourself . That 's what they always say to justify invading privacy , Skye . These people stand for everything we despise . Secrets , censorship ... Enough with the manifesto , Miles ! We can 't let them get away with it ! Manning , Snowden , Aaron Swartz , these are modern day revolutionaries . This has nothing to do with that . You leak ... The guy 's hiding behind platitudes . He 's dirty. I can feel it . Scrubbed clean , actually . Nothing much on him . He 's got no family records . His apartment 's under an alias . And he plays a lot of Minecraft where he runs a rather nasty mob . What , as a zombie ? Zombie pigman . Keep looking . Go ahead . Say it . I don 't do petty . But you called it . I trusted my gut even though you said she was a risk . When someone breaks into my house , I usually don 't invite them to stay . - But that 's me . - That was me , too . Then that alien staff went through my heart . Sure it didn 't go through the brain ? You don 't really do comforting either , do you ? What is your gut telling you now ? That she 's still hiding something . Sir , we found some evidence . She 's been defending you , saying you 're a stand-up guy . So I 'm going to give you a chance . You want to tell her , or should I ? I don 't have to listen to you ... There goes your chance . Your boyfriend here made a few deposits in the days following the leak . All said , it 's about a million dollars . What ? - Real stand-up guy . - l can explain ... Did you sell information ? Miles ? Yes or no ? - Did you ? - Yes , but ... Oh ! You are so dead ! What the hell were you thinking ? It was a million dollars . A million dollars . It would change my life . Our lives . And that woman was harmless . I looked into it . No one with good intentions pays that kind of money for information . Did you ever think about that ? Of course I did . I never would have done it if I thought ... Who 's the woman you referred to ? A fan of the Rising Tide . Some rich girl in a flower dress . She knew all about me , said I had a gift . She thought people like us deserved more . Oh , you deserve more . She pointed me to a Chinese S.H.I.E.L.D. feed , wanted me to crack it . You thought that was harmless ? I checked the data stream . It didn 't seem like anything you and I hadn 't already put out there , Skye . And I traced the account where the money came from to make sure it wasn 't some evil corporation . It was just an eco-research lab . Otherwise , I would never ... Ecological research ? Yeah , insects . Some study with centipedes . What 's more harmless than that ? It appears the volatility in the serum has been neutralized . I 'm surprised you got him to cooperate . He has dreams . I told him they 'd come true . You gave him a name , didn 't you ? Everyone wants to be remembered . Thank God no one 's gonna have to actually call him that . You were right . The platelets in his blood prevent the EXTREMIS in the serum from combusting . That 's fantastic . The others will be pleased . Good work , Raina . Now drain him . It appears Centipede is responsible for Mr. Chan 's kidnapping . First L.A. , now Hong Kong . What kind of organization are we dealing with ? International , well-financed , interested in creating a super-soldier . Let 's hope finding Mr. Chan will provide some answers . Using the account information Mr. Lydon gave us , S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ believes he 's being held here . Any ideas what Centipede wants with Chan ? Hard to say , but Simmons thinks that considering he 's pyrokinetic ... There 's a good chance his genetics could stabilize the EXTREMIS element of the Centipede serum . - Keep the test subjects from going ... - Boom ! If Mr. Chan is Centipede 's lab rat , we need to get there before the experiment 's over . This is no test . This is torture . Thank you for your participation . Our group really owes you one . I won 't let you ... What have you done ? We don 't understand what gave you this ability . But the reason you don 't burn is because your blood platelets are fire-resistant . Which is why we 're removing them . Take this upstairs . Raina , you said I have a gift . And you 're giving it . Raina ! Raina ! Agent May and I will be handling the field work . You stay and oversee the prisoners . Sir ? I was Skye 's S.O. It was my responsibility ... It was my call to bring Skye onto the plane . And you warned me against it . My problem. I fix it . I 'm sorry. I honestly didn 't know . All our talks . Did you mean none of it ? I risked everything to help you , and it turns out every word out of your mouth since we met is total crap . - That 's not true . - " Democratization of knowledge . " " The truth will set you free . " The truth sure as hell came out I believe in all of those things . I just don 't know why they have to go hand in hand with barely scraping by . Come on , Skye . You lived in your van for the last year ... Now , you 're making fun of my van ? I could have funded us for years ! Us . So you wouldn 't have to sacrifice your principles , joining this corrupt institution to find what you 're looking for . What 's wrong with me trying to do that ? I 'Il tell you what 's wrong with that . An innocent guy might die . For money . You know I 'd never intentionally hurt anyone . I 'm just trying to get my life together . At least you know what you 're looking for . Me ? I don 't have that . For a long time , I thought it was you . I guess I was wrong . I guess so . Building has five floors . The first four are research . Fifth is listed as maintenance but uses half the building 's energy . Either they 're guarding the world 's largest vacuum ... Or that 's where Chan 's being held . Send your B and C teams in through the tunnels to secure the lower floors . Warn them that the Centipede serum is highly explosive . Understood . Where do we go in ? The roof . There . Heat signature confirmed . I love these things . Agent Kwan , it 's you . We 're here to get you out . Strike team needs a security override , stat . Kwan , can you arrange ... Chan , what have you done ? I 've set myself free . Coulson 's in trouble . Mr. Chan , I know you 're in pain . This is nothing . You were the ones killing me , forcing me to keep this gift locked up inside . So we 're good , right ? The entire facility 's been locked down . - Are you sure about this ? - No . This is pretty cool . The alarms disconnected the system from all exterior servers . Can you fix it or not ? Yes , but you 've gotta get me on site . - No way . - Not a chance . You 're a hacker , Skye . Not SEAL Team Six . No , but he is . His file say anything about him being homicidal ? Just said he was kind of a tool . Mr. Chan , believe it or not , this could still get worse . You bend someone long enough , and they break . Poor little Chan Ho Yin may have believed your lies , but not Scorch . Who ? Oh , crap . They gave him a name . Give me a clean look . I 'Il make sure he wakes up in a S.H.l.E.L.D. containment facility . Waking is optional at this point . I 'm out . Nothing can stop me . Where are we on the doors ? Almost there . S.H.l.E.L.D. has infiltrated the building . No , it 's under control . Didn 't want to tell them ? Chan 's true nature has revealed itself . Without his platelets , the serum will combust . Wouldn 't be the first one to blow up on you . I 'm beginning to think you 're bad luck . - How long is this gonna take ? - Done . Doors are unlocked . Where 's Chan ? - He 's gone . - Damn it ! That tranquilizer was his last chance . You know that . I know . It 's time to minimize the damage . Simmons , are the building 's computers back online ? Yes . Uncuff Miles . We 're going to need his help . You ! I wish you all the best . Please . Look , we can fix you . Make you stronger . Take the name " Scorch " and make it mean something . It already does . No ! Mr. Chan , we don 't want to hurt you . But we have to . We gotta move . You need to drive the blast into the main ventilation shaft . Yeah , and on up to the roof . Skye managed to extract some files from the building 's mainframe . It 's not much , but could get us a fix on Centipede . Maybe . You can 't save someone from themselves , sir . You can if you get to them early enough . You 've got two choices . Take what 's in this box , or we put you in a slightly bigger one . You wanna give me a hint ? What 's it do ? Whatever we tell it to do . I 'd try to avoid any unlawful activity . And I think you 'Il find it hard to use electronic devices for a while . You can go now . Cool , but we 're still in Hong Kong . Yep . - l live in Austin , Texas . - l know . Oh , and Agent Kwan 's family thanks you for the anonymous donation . My office . So you planning to stay ? If they let me . You 've changed . Good . I mean , you 're not who you used to be . And you 're not who I thought you were . I hope you find what you 're looking for . Make it a double . Is there any other kind ? So I 'm going to Coulson 's office now . Figured you might wanna be there , being my S.O. and all . I 'm off the clock . Right . Okay then . I didn 't want anything to ... Stop lying . Since the moment you stepped foot on this plane , you 've been lying . To my face . To all of us . - No , I haven 't ... - You 're lying now . I stood up for you to my team down there . And some of us started to believe in you . - Risked our lives for you . - I ... Why are you here ? You 've been keeping something from us this whole time , and it wasn 't just a boyfriend . You have a secret , Skye , and one chance to come out with it . That 's now . Or I 'm done with you . What is this ? It 's everything I have . On us ? On me . That 's why I learned to crack systems , why I joined the Rising Tide . To find any details I could about my parents . There 's nothing . No records . There 's no trace of them . My lifelong search has led to a single document . Redacted . By S.H.l.E.L.D. No matter what you do , I 'Il never stop looking . You might not like what you find . It can 't be worse than what I 've imagined . Maybe I can help . Well , you know I 'm not gonna do the talking . The doctor is dead . About time . She did find a solution to our combustion problem . We believe we 'Il soon have stable subjects . On to Stage Two . That mean my situation is going to improve any ? Well , other problems have surfaced . Resurfaced , I should say . The S.H.l.E.L.D. unit in Hong Kong . We 've encountered them before . They took our subject off the map in Los Angeles . Not much I can do about that in here . So that 's not why I 'm getting the visit . We would like you to touch base with The Clairvoyant . See if any insights can be given . On Stage Three . The Clairvoyant doesn 't like to be touched . We all have to do things that make us uncomfortable if we are ever to get our toy soldiers off the shelf . You know that better than any of us . I like your dress . I know .

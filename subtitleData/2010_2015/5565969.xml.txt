The new couch came in . That 's like , a little greener than I thought . Probably just the pictures . Go around ! Ah , this guy ! - What 's going on ? - Woah , woah , woah . Oh , he 's still on us . It 's them . They found us . Hang on ! Hang on ! Maggie . Are you ok ? I ... I think so . Take Bo . Take her . Take her . Call Channing . They found her . - I 'm coming ! - She 's unconscious . Don 't worry . I 'm coming . Oh my God . Oh my God . You ok ? Are you hurt ? - Call an ambulance . - Maybe this will help . No . She 's just a little girl . Please . I don 't care . Put her down . Put her down . Don 't move her . I 'm a doctor . An ambulance is coming . Oh , thank God . Are you ok ? _ - Please . - Thank you . Wake up , caveman , your priest is here . It 's a little game we like to play . - You going to be ok in here ? - Fine . Thank you . Good evening . I didn 't ask for a priest . You have such a long history of violence , Mr. Tate . First arrested at 14 , after that numerous arrests for robbery and assault . And now , you 're being executed for two counts of felony murder in 30 minutes . And you have nothing to confess ? I 'm innocent . I was set up . Nobody seems to believe you , do they ? No one ever did . No friends or family have come to be with you today , nor in the seven years that you have been in here . It must be very difficult to maintain hope , remembering who you once were . - I don 't need a confession . - Well ... thank God for that . We live in a world , where everyone wants forgiveness . But no one asks permission . What do you want ? I 'm here ... to help you , escape . - Mostly cuts and bruises , right ? - Yeah , but she 's still unconscious . We need to make sure there 's no internal injuries . Stop . Please stop . She woke up ? That 's her brain ? - That can 't be right . - System 's functioning . Check it again . Stop it ! Just one minute please . No , we 're good here . That 's weird , right ? Stop it ! Turn it off ! Thank you . So , if I say yes , what 's the catch ? Well , I 'm not just freeing you . I 'm hiring you . Last night , a man and a woman died in a car accident . They were foster parents to a little girl named Bo . Yeah , this is never gonna work . Winter , careful with the beads . But this wasn 't an accident , it was a failed attempt to kidnap this little girl . But now she 's at St. Ann 's Hospital and we need to get there before the others do . Yeah , well , guess what ? - I 'm not a kidnapper . - I 'm not asking you to kidnap her , I 'm asking you to save her . This little girl , is very important . And you have 4 minutes and ... 54 seconds to decide . What the hell are you talking about ? Huh ? What ? You think this is funny ? Are you thick or just stubborn ? I am offering you a way out . - Hey ! - Hey ! - 4 minutes , 38 seconds . - Why would I trust you , huh ? Huh ? You know what happens when you believe in people ? Your so-called friends ? Why do you think I 'm here , huh ? All clear . Clear . No rhythm . All right . Give me one of epi , one of atropine . All clear . Clear . - Come on . - It 's been 13 minutes , doctor . Doctor . - Are you calling it ? - No . Doctor . 11.58 p.m. You did everything you could . I 'm sorry , doctor . Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I shall fear no evil . You have 50 seconds . Look , it wasn 't me . They said it was just a smash and grab . They framed me . I don 't care . 40 seconds . 20 seconds . Why me ? Because I believe in you . Ok . Hallelujah . Lights out . And systems down . My hands . Get his hands . Feet . Feet . Good , good , now hit him . Hit him ! Come on , hit me ! Son of a bitch . Hit him . Hit him . Now , down to the left Go left , go left . Emergency lights , hurry . Where 's the key ? Where 's the key ? C block . He went that way . He went that way . He went that way . Peace be with you . Let 's go . Yeah , nice to me you too ! All right , knock it off ! Knock it off ! Good morning . I 'm Winter . We 'll fly for a couple hours , and we 'll talk . How 's that for a plan ? I didn 't ask for cuffs . Yeah , she 's a bit exuberant . - You don 't know me at all . - Uncuff him . Why him ? He 's a murderer . Why not me ? Let 's talk about this later . You 're Bo , right ? I 'm Doctor Terry , I 'm a resident here . That 's a cute turtle . His name 's Stanley . My mom gave him to me . My real mom . I don 't remember her . So , you 're gonna need a few more tests , but , you 're gonna be ok . But there are some other things ... Maggie and George . It was a very bad crash . They 're dead . I 'm so sorry . They were my parents for only two weeks . But they were so nice . The man in the other room . It 's not your fault . Excuse me ? You can 't quit . You 're a good doctor . You saved Senga . - Who 's Senga ? - Come on ! You took care of him . You 're tired , Bo . I 'll check in on you later , ok ? How is Senga doing ? I 'm sorry , I don 't know anyone named Senga . Get some rest . Ms. Moore . Hello Skouras . - The girl is at St. Ann 's hospital . - I know . I 'll be back tomorrow . Well , tomorrow will be too late . Winter will be back for her . Milton Winter ? He 's dead . That 's what he wants everyone to think . I was very clear . Tonight , I have to be out of pocket . It 's my mother 's birthday . - Bo is at St. Ann 's hospital . On the 8th floor . - Mesdames et Messieurs ... Call me when you have her . Thank you . _ _ Inexplicable phenomena have been part of Bo 's life since she was born . These events are unpredictable . But seem to be connected to her emotions . Now , she has no control over them . But she is starting to become the person she 's going to be . There was a guy , Jerome , in prison . He could bend spoons . This is very real , Mr. Tate . Jerome was real too . Couldn 't bend knives though . We were able to hide her for a long time . We want to share her with the world at just the right moment . People who tried to kidnap her are very powerful people . They want all of her talents for themselves . They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world . Hey , even if all of it is true , why me ? State of the art , GPS tracking device . We 'll know where you are , plus or minus two feet . That 's just to make sure you maintain your end of the bargain . And if you want it off , you 'll have to chop off your leg . Well , maybe I 'll chew it off . Be my guest . - Clear to land in 5 minutes . - You 're gonna give me a gun , right ? We don 't do guns , Mr. Tate . We 're the good guys . Is it true , you gave notice ? It 's not just about this , is it ? Sorry to hear that . We 'll have to put makeup on your face on the way to make it look like bruises . Hey , look , this isn 't part of the deal we agreed to . This may be the most important day of your life . Exciting , isn 't it ? * * * If it makes you feel any better , I 'm having a bad day too . We think she 's in ICU . Go in through the ER , bring her back and meet Santos there . - This is it . - Put him down , let 's go . Let 's go , now . We got a window . - What do we got ? - Fell off a ladder . Contusions on his face and arms , but he 's stable . Then park him , we have a bus accident . Let 's move . Let 's move , come on , let 's go ! - Sorry . - Excuse me . Excuse me , where is the girl that was in there ? She 's stable , they moved her . You stink . I fell in a sewer . - But they washed me off . - You still stink . - I don 't . - You do . - What 's your name ? - Tate . - You were crying . - No , I wasn 't . - Yes you were . - Well , I hit my head . Those bruises are fake . How do you know ? Because , you 're not feeling any pain . - Can I touch them ? - No . Ow ! You see ? It hurts a lot . We have to go . - Are you my new foster dad ? - No ! - Good . Because you stink . - Yeah . - We established that . - I 'm not going with you . Yes , you are . Winter says you have to come with me . - Milton ? - Winter ! Milton Winter . Where is he ? I 'm taking you to him . Ok . You know why you were crying ? - I told you , it hurts . - No . You remembered you were good once . - Come on , let 's go . - God ! Where are you going ? I 'm taking her to radiology . Of course . I 'll walk with you . - How are you feeling ? - Good . Don 't worry , I 'll take her . Uh , I have to do it . Hospital policy . Uh , you know what ? I 'm gonna take the girl . I could lose my job . Doctor ... Elliot . You all right ? You look a little pale . - Please , I don 't wanna have to hit you back . - It 's not a problem . Are you sure you don 't want to hit me ? Not cool . Come on , come on ! Go , go , go go go ! Stop , please ! - Do you think she 's gonna be ok ? - Who ? That lady . - I stabbed her hard in the butt . - Yeah , she 'll be fine . Who cares ? - Where are we going ? - I don 't know . - Where 's Milton ? - I don 't know . Can you stop talking for a second ? I know who Senga is . What ? Senga . She 's not an old patient . We have to find Doctor Terry and tell him , so he won 't quit . Your daughter , she 's gone . She 's not my daughter . ♪ so can I show you love ♪ ♪ sweet love ♪ - * take time to grow * - Swell . ♪ there 's nothing here but love ♪ You 're late . - I have a life too , you know . - I 'm sorry . - Did he eat ? - Not much . I tried though . - You can pay me on Sunday . - Thank you , Carmen . Hey , Dad . A man died today . I tried to save him , and I couldn 't . First time , you know ? I don 't know ... I 've seen people die before , but ... this guy ... I was sure I could save . Guess you were right . Remember what you used to say to me ? No ? I do . You said you wouldn 't come to me if I was the last doctor on Earth . You were right . You were always right , man . Always so strong . So full of opinions . So when you got sick , I was gonna fix you . I was gonna ... I was gonna cure you , you know . I was gonna show you , you were wrong . And you were gonna thank me . You 'll be happy to know I quit today . You see ? You always have the last word . Even when you can 't say it . What are you doing ? - I need an address . - Well , you can 't just run away like that ! We need to go to 1422 Oswald Street . - What are you talking about ? - I need to tell Doctor Terry about Senga . Can you shut up and listen to me for a second , you little brat ? Nobody cares . No wonder you had 20 foster parents . You 're mean . And you 're being stupid . And you have anger problems . Hey ! You guys , get in . Let 's go . - Channing ! - Come on , we gotta go . We gotta go . Let 's go . Where the hell were you ? You were supposed to be back at the ambulance . Yeah , well we couldn 't get there , ' cause some guy was beating the crap outta me . It wasn 't a guy , it was a girl . - Yeah , I just meant that ... - A girl beat the crap out of you ? Ok . Yeah . But it was a ... big girl . She wasn 't big . In here . Give me that . Milton ! Bo ! Come and see me . Look at you , you 're getting bigger . No I 'm not . I saw you two weeks ago . Ms. Channing . Go and show Bo her new clothes , would you ? - Well done , Mr. Tate . - The bracelet , I want it off . - It 's not that simple . - We had a deal . - I said you come work for me . - Yeah , and I did your work . Your work ... has just begun . I 'm sure you noticed that Bo is a very special little girl . Your job is to protect her . Keep her safe . - What ? From that woman ? - That woman , and all the people that woman works for . - Is he gonna be my new foster dad ? - In a second , sweetheart . In a couple hours , you 'll be going to Buffalo , New York . You 'll start by hiding there for a while . - Our associates will help you . - He 's mean . - And he stinks . - Yeah , I fell in a sewer ! I told you ! You see , she doesn 't want to be with me either . We 'll be helping you . But the ultimate responsibility for her well-being , her health , her education , that belongs to you . Look , I 'm not Mary Poppins , all right ? Milton , I wanna stay with you . Come here , sweetheart . Come here . Now , listen . We talked about this , remember ? So if I say yes , how many weeks is this job supposed to last ? Weeks ? So what ? Months ? It 'll be the best years of your life . It took us five years to find the Adams girl , and you lost her in one day ? Come on , twerp , what do you have ? The only relevant data in Baltimore is a property that Winter bought one year before he died . The address is 6105 Newkirk Street . It looks like a warehouse . I 'm sending the coordinates to your GPS now . Yeah ! Take a spin . You look great . - Thank you . - Do you like it ? The adversary is very resourceful . So keep use of cellphones and other electronics to a minimum . Channing will monitor your ... whereabouts . Your progress . You realize I haven 't agreed to any of this yet ? Oh yes , you have . You 're all over the airwaves . FBI , police , everybody 's looking for you . Well , maybe I 'll take my chances . You won 't last 10 minutes out there . - They 'll shoot you on sight . - Ah , but , that won 't happen . Not with our help . We 're not superheroes . But we are dedicated , and hard-working people . We can protect you . You still haven 't answered my question . Why me ? That is for you . I want you to take good care of her . Educate her . Good organic food . * * * the accomodations . You 're gonna be raising her now . I 'll need a gun . We talked about that already . Mr. Tate . When you first saw her , you felt something , didn 't you ? What do you mean ? What did you feel ? I don 't know . I don 't like kids . It 's them . - Get Bo . - How did they find us ? - Which floor , please ? - Quickly . - Stanley ! No , no , Stanley ! - Bo ! Leave it ! Come on ! - Hurry up ! - Go , go , go ! - No , no ! - Tate . Tate ! Tate ! Come on , * * * . They were here , and now they 're gone , Corey . Where else would they go ? Check for any other properties , people , any other locations , check it again . I 'll wait . Just be quick about it . - Hello , Thumbelina . - Let her go . Milton ! - I thought you didn 't hit girls . - I do now . Tate ! Tate ! No ! Help him ! Help him . Stop it ! * * * Go , go , go ! - What about the cash ? - Forget the cash . Go , go , go , go , go ! What happened ? I don 't understand . It 's ok , sweetheart . It 's just like all the other spookies , just ... a ... a little bit , but that 's all . - Winter . - Faster . Go , go , go ! Mr. Tate . You can 't go to Buffalo . All our locations there were compromised . You have to keep moving from place to place . We 'll divert her . You 've got to get out right now . - Where do we go ? - We don 't know . Get out ! Don 't trust anyone . We 'll try and find you . - Milton ! - Come on sweetheart , go , go ! Take this money . Take this money ! Down there . Go , go ! - 30 ... - $ 120 for the next few years . Swell . - We there yet ? - Yeah , we 're here . That thing back there , how do you do that ? What do you mean ? That spooky thing , that thing with the birds , what was that ? - Does that happen a lot ? - I don 't want to talk about it . Will they give us more dough here ? - You mean , for cooking ? . - What ? Terry ! - No , come on . - Bo , what are you doing here ? I need to talk to you about Senga . My friend needs help . - What happened ? - A mean woman shot him . - You were shot ? - It 's nothing , I 'm fine . He 's a doctor . A really good doctor . If you were shot , we have to report it to the police . Look , can you stop the bleeding first ? I 'd appreciate that . All right , come inside . I don 't have any anesthetic . Just sew it up . All right . Have a seat on the table . Lift up your shirt . He 's your father . He 's barely conscious . He 's almost gone . He 's proud of you . No he isn 't . You can 't quit . What about Senga ? I told you , I don 't know who that is . - I know . - Antibiotic . I thought you knew Senga . Sometimes I get things wrong . Take a deep breath in . You don 't know her yet . But you will . It 's gonna hurt a little bit . Try not to move please . One day she 'll be really sick . But you 'll save her . She 'll live because of you . - She 's a singer . - Yeah ? Senga is a singer . Yeah . She 's really good . When people are having a hard time , her music will make them feel happy . You 'll fix her . You 're doing great . You 'll fix a lot of people . Same way you 're fixing him . One more , and you 'll be outta here . Your father thinks you 're a good doctor . He knows you tried to save him . He knows he was wrong . And he 's sorry he never said it . He loves you . He believes in you . The bullet barely nicked you . Keep it dry and try not to carry anything . The police ? It 's fine . How does she know all of this ? I don 't know , man . She 's a pain in the ass . Terry . Ok . Get the anesthesiologist , prepare the OR . I 'll be there in 10 minutes . They 're short-staffed . They need me . Get that sweatshirt . Come on . Hey , Carmen , it 's Adam . I know it 's short notice , but I need you to come over . I got called in to the hospital . Thank you . Thank you so much . Goodbye , Bo . Bye . Thanks . Ok . Now where do we really go ? Philadelphia . Look , that was very touching . But if this is gonna work , when we get to a new town , we 're gonna need some rules . Ok ? Ok . Number 1 : that doctor guy wasn 't your business . You 're nosy . He fixed you . Yeah . And that 's fine and all , but when we get somewhere , you need to mind your own business , you understand me ? What if a girl falls into a river ? I don 't care . Now promise . What if a man is walking on the side of the road and it 's really hot , and he drops a penny , and it gets stuck on the melting road , and his hand gets stuck , - and a truck is coming ? - That 's never happening . But what if it did ? _ - What 's her name ? - Agnes . Agnes . Winter . - How 's the backhand ? - She 's protected again . You lost your chance . Protected by Tate . I have to admit , that was a surprise . You know it 's gonna blow up in your face . Skouras is closing in . I can 't believe you used to be partners with that guy . Well the past is a very ... tricky place , my dear . We 'll have to move you from town to town . Well , it 's incredibly risky . But , let 's look on the bright side ... Think of all the people she 'll help along the way . You put her with a death-row inmate . No ... I put her ... with her father . What if a piece of the moon crashes into a house , and they keep spiders in a cage , but the cage breaks ... and then the people are * * * have a gorilla who 's allergic to spiders . I don 't know where to start with that one . What 's rule number 2 ? Always do what I say . Ok . But ... what if we 're in a igloo , and you had a cold , couldn 't smell anything and you told me to light a candle , but I smell gas ? You know what ?

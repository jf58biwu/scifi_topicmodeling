 MAN [ IN RUSSIAN OVER PA ] : [ IN RUSSIAN ] What 'd he say ? Happy hour on the Lido Deck at 1600 . Is there a magic show ? [ IN RUSSIAN ] TEX : Hey . CHANDLER [ IN RUSSIAN ] : [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ SLOW CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS ] Uh , Ava , leave us now , please . Is my father with you ? Doctor Tophet ? No . He 's not . But he 's alive and safe on my ship . He tried very hard to be here himself , and he wanted me to tell you ... he loves you very much . Ava , hurry along now , please . That voice ... you must recognize it . It was Kelly , who pulled the wool over your eyes back in Cuba ... pretending so well to be British Commanding Officer . - Excellent liars . The whole family . - That 's enough . RUSKOV : See how she treats me ? I could have killed her or fed her to my crew . Instead , I lavish her with the treasures of the world . My own executive officer , Asmik , gave up his stateroom ... for her and her insolent daughter , but nothing is good enough . [ RUSKOV CHUCKLES ] Where are my manners ? Please , sit . [ SIGHS ] I 'd like to treat you with the respect your rank affords ... but you are gonna have to meet me halfway . Now , tell me of Dr. Scott 's progress with the vaccine . She 's close . Right ? My name is Thomas Chandler ... commander , United States Navy , serial number 4242022634 . There 's no need for that . The Geneva Convention doesn 't exist anymore . Hell , Geneva doesn 't exist anymore . [ CHUCKLES ] Ah . Still won 't talk ? See , I told you . He would rather go it alone and die ... than share in the glory of saving the world . Why else would you , the ship 's captain ... personally lead the mission to save some poor island girl ? Like with all tragic heroes ... your hubris bought about your downfall . What do you have to say to that , Commander Chandler ? My name is Thomas Chandler ... commander , United States Navy ... serial number 4242022634 . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Cobra 1-5 on final approach . WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Cobra 1-5 , green deck . Helos have crisscrossed 100 square miles of ocean . No sign of him . I don 't know what I 'm hoping for . Whether they 're still out there fighting for their lives , or the Russians did get them . - Any sign of the Vyerni ? - Sir , nothing on the SLQ-32 . Zero electronic emissions . They 're most likely radio silent . - Maybe . But they 're close . - How do you know ? Because if they have the CO , they 're gonna call . Try to make a trade . Tex and the CO for Dr. Scott and her work . SCOTT : So , what you can see here is the virus attaching to receptors ... in a healthy human cell . Once attached ... it invades and completely destroys its host before moving on to the next cell . This is what happens to everyone in the world who contracts the virus . And death comes quickly ... as you have seen . Yes . SCOTT : Now , here , once again ... the virus is on the attack . But this time , the receptors , to which it attaches , are free-floating . Not part of a healthy cell . So it simply flushes out the system ... without causing any infection . And that is you , Bertrise . Those are your receptors , which I have injected into our primate friend over there . And if it can fool the virus inside him ... You 'll have a vaccine . I was always so sick as a kid . Everyone used to tease me that I was pretending ... so I wouldn 't have to go to school . And now here I am . Immune to the most deadly virus in the world and possibly its savior . [ DOOR OPENS ] Oh , Bertrise . I 'd like to introduce you to Will Mason . He 's the one who heard your call on the radio . It 's very nice to meet you . I 'm so glad that you 're all right . Thank you for helping to find me . Is there any word on Captain Chandler or Tex ? No , ma 'am . But we 'll get them back . Somehow . Sir , Admiral Ruskov on the HF . - This is Commander Slattery . RUSKOV : Commander ... I won 't waste time . Obviously , I want Dr. Scott . Anything short of her delivery , along with all relevant samples and work ... will result in the death of your captain and his companion . Are you still there , XO ? Of course you are . Just don 't know what to say . I understand . You 've never been in command before . I need proof of life . Let me talk to my commanding officer . I 'm here , XO . You have 10 minutes to decide . - What guarantees can you give me ? - Well , just one . If you don 't comply with my demands , I will not only torture and kill your friends ... I will annihilate your ship and every soul on board . I possess enough nuclear warheads to boil the seas in which you pathetically sail . Ten minutes . Combat , this is the XO . Tell me you got a bearing on that call . Oh , my God . [ LAUGHING ] Well , aren 't you the lucky one ? GREEN : Break them out , soft kill the engines and haul ass to the extract point . SLATTERY : That ship 's twice our size . If alarms sound while you look for the CO , it 's four of you against 300 angry Russians . - It 's doable , sir . - Who 's team leader ? You ? - I wouldn 't volunteer unless I were fit , sir . - Even at 80 percent , he 's good to go , sir . Now is not the time . The Russians are calling back in less than five . I have the vaccine . The monkey survived . The last damn monkey . Are you saying you have the vaccine ? - Vaccine that works ? - Well , in an ideal world , I 'd do more testing ... " but yes . Ruskov doesn 't need me . You can send him a dose in exchange for Tex and the captain . Ruskov won 't just take your word for it . He 'll wanna make sure . Well , then I 'll show him myself . I 'm no longer essential on this ship . From here on in , it 's a case of mass producing the vaccine ... from my original formula . - But doctor ... - I can show Doc Rios everything he needs . And if extra help is required , I 'm sure you can strike a bargain with Quincy . I can 't let you go . Ruskov asked for me . And I won 't do a thing until he releases Tex and the captain . GREEN : You don 't realize what you 're signing up for . You 'd be Ruskov 's slave for life or until he decides to kill you . We all know he 'll chase us to the ends of the earth . This is the only way to stop him ... once and for all . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ DOOR OPENS ] [ OFFICER SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN ENGLISH ] Coming forward now . Give to me hands . You 've looked better . Oh , you should 've seen the other guy . There was only one ? He 's a big unit . No sense of humor . You wanna know the kicker ? He didn 't even ask me any questions . Hey . No talk , or I kiss your ass . - Heh . You mean " kick my ass . " - Just shut up your head . Okay ? I spoke to our friend from Chicago . If I know Mike , he 's planning on paying us a visit . I better find a way to make him feel welcome . Kirov class battleships are on a CONAS system . That 's combined nuclear and steam propulsion . Not gonna be able to take out both boilers so , if you wanna kill her , damage the shaft . Engines can spin all day , but the props won 't turn . Not gonna be able to burn through them with incendiaries I 'm carrying . There 's a soft spot , you gotta find it . Gotta be careful . Could be a meltdown if you use explosives . - Yeah . We 're all dead , and we lose the CO . - Right . Which is why you 're coming with . Like I said before , you 're part of my team . You ready to bring it ? Hell , yeah , sir . Let 's map this out . BURK : This is a .45 caliber pistol . Excellent knockdown power . The trade-off is that it 's large and heavy . It 's got an eight-round magazine , loaded . I 'm gonna give you an extra . Let 's hope you won 't need it . And lastly , the suppressor . It 's highly effective . Without it , you 'll wake up the entire ship . - But you need time to attach it . Are we clear ? - Crystal . Outstanding . Thank you . If anything should happen ... finish what we started . Russians are picking you up in a helo out in the middle of nowhere ... taking you to their ship . - We won 't have any contact after that . - I understand . It 's a little late to ask if you really wanna do this . Let me just say , what you 're doing is very brave . I 'm proud to know you . You make it sound like goodbye . I 'll see you for breakfast . How about , uh , Great Escape ? Kind of hard to tunnel out of a ship . Yeah . You got a point there . You ever see Papillon ? Only Steve McQueen flicks ? What about Escape from Alcatraz ? You 'd need a dummy . What about , uh , Bad English over there ? What are you talking of ? Quit it . Take off . Turn around . Good . [ SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] Virus samples . Okay . Careful . OFFICER : Come . Tracking device moving at a steady 15 knots . Looks like we 're aboard the Vyerni . - Extraction team 's under way . - We got you now , you son of a bitch . [ DOOR OPENS ] Dr. Scott . How long I 've waited to welcome you aboard Vyerni . I won 't be talking further or doing any kind of work until you bring up your prisoners . Of course . It was expected . What the hell are you doing here ? Now I understand why the good doctor agreed to pay us a visit . [ SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] The deal was me for them . You gave your word that you 'd let them go . Not until I confirm that you 've delivered what I 've requested . Well , I assume you have a lab . Ah . Dr. Scott . Ah . So nice to see you again . - Do I know you ? - European Congress of Virology , 2011 . Uh , you spoke on techniques for hemagglutination-inhibition ... with arthropod-borne viruses . And afterwards , I introduced myself , shook hands . Niels Sorenson . I 'm sorry . I don 't recall . SORENSON : I was with Professor Lindblom . I remember Jonas . You were in his department ? Um , for a time . Uh , he never really saw clearly what I was trying to , uh ... Anyways ... I 'd invite you in , but it 's such a mess . [ SORENSON CHUCKLES ] Uh , actually , they are , uh , supposed to clean up every day . And I tell them that the UV light kills the virus , but , um ... [ CHUCKLES ] - You 're infected . - Uh , not exactly . - But you 're not even symptomatic . - Um ... - Perhaps I should explain . - It was you . - You added the human gene . - Yes . You weaponized the virus . What ? No . No . I didn 't weaponize it . I was really close to a major breakthrough . I added my gene to the virus , and then injected it back into my bloodstream ... and it worked . I am completely immune . I just ... Uh , I didn 't know that I also made myself a carrier . So you 're Patient Zero ? No . I didn 't start it . I 'm trying to find a solution here . I 'm trying to fix it , and I can fix it as soon as I get the primordial strain . - Is that ... ? - You don 't understand what you 've done . The primordial won 't work now . The virus that you created , the modifications you made . You 've made it so much worse . And you could have come forward at any point . - I mean , you must have known this . - No . That was too late . There was zero benefit for me coming forward ... You killed four billion people . And you never gave them a chance to understand how it happened ? - I can now . I mean , I can solve it now . - It 's too late . I 've already done it . [ CHUCKLES ] I already made the vaccine . - That 's a lie . - See for yourself . Hey , that ... No . You 're allowed to do that . Actually , that 's mine . I would like to speak with the admiral . No . She doesn 't go anywhere . You don 't get to do it without me . Did you really think that your DNA could save the human race ? Dr. Scott . Unbelievable . I mean , I can 't believe it . She kissed you . And you 're a married man , for Pete 's sake . And you 're Navy . Did you not get the talk ? No fraternization with the ladies , buddy . Ladder room , port side , 0400 . - Know where that is ? - I have an idea . First we gotta get by this guy . And there 's two guards on the P-way . - Goddamn it . He had to send her . - Right . I 'm standing right there . She could have passed me the note . Tex , 0400 . Got it . RUSKOV : You lied to me . I took you in because you told me she was not capable of succeeding without you . Now I find you 've wasted my time and resources . Do you really think I 've kept myself in here for nothing ? I 'm telling you , admiral , her vaccine won 't work . You still need me . That 's right . I do . [ IN RUSSIAN ] RUSKOV : Dr. Scott . Shh . Now we test the vaccine . RUSKOV [ IN RUSSIAN ] : [ SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN ENGLISH ] What are you waiting for ? Do it . [ SCREAMING ] [ EXHALES ] [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ] - Standing by . - Outstanding . Let 's hope she got him that note . [ OFFICERS SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN AND LAUGHING ] RUSKOV : Comfortable ? As a boy , I shared a room not much larger than this with my five brothers and sisters . My parents were not among the political elite . We grew familiar with tight quarters . With cold , with hunger . Oh , that 's a real sob story . Well told . Aren 't they expecting you back in Transylvania before sunrise ? [ CHUCKLES ] This vaccine your Dr. Scott has developed ... is now the single greatest commodity in the world . Every day , its value increases ... as those not yet infected grow desperate for it . And it 's mine . [ CHUCKLES ] The American dream . Isn 't that the expression ? Think it got lost in the translation . RUSKOV : Once I have successfully tested the vaccine ... I will most likely kill all of you and destroy your ship . But perhaps there 's another way . A way that can help your shipmates , your friends , your families . You have courage , first-rate ship ... a crew that will follow you wherever you say . I think we can work well together . Achieve a great deal together . My name is Thomas Chandler , commander , United States Navy ... serial number 4242022634 . TEX : It 's a good talk , Boris . If there 's nothing else , well , we 'd like to get some shut-eye . Ten minutes , sir . - Master Chief , how you feeling ? - Scared to death , sir . Well , you 're not alone , I 'm sure . - No , sir . I am not . - Yeah . This your XO . So ... two sailors walk into a bar ... and they both walk out ... We will get our men back . We will get our captain back . That is all . Maneuver the ship to pick up the extract team . Aye , sir . - Thought I 'd open with a joke . - It was a good one , sir . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ GUARD GRUNTING AND GASPING ] Now you can kiss my ass . [ OFFICERS SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ] [ GRUNTING ] Mm . I don 't wish to ruin the ending for you , but your vaccine will not work . Isn 't that right , Dmitri ? You 're not feeling so good ? The virus already has you in its clutches . [ DOOR OPENS ] - The cavalry has arrived . - You okay , sir ? I 'm fine . This your idea , Burk ? Can 't take all the credit . I 'm happy to be here , sir . Yeah . We 'll talk about this later . Where 's Dr. Scott ? Lab should be one level down , back aft . Get her on the way to extract point . Off the flight deck . - Let 's move . - Go , go , go , go , go . Like clockwork . [ WHINING ] GREEN [ WHISPERING ] : Stingray , this is Tiger Shark . Rally point one is a go . Package in hand . - Moving to rally point two . How copy ? STINGRAY : Copy that . Sir , lab 's ... Sir , lab is this way . Captain , this is Officer Country . Sir ? Sir ? - Sir , what are you looking for ? - Asmik . You want off this ship , come with me right now . Cossetti , Cruz , I want you to escort Mrs. Tophet ... and her daughter to the extraction point . COSSETTI : Yes , sir . The rest of you with me . We 're going to get Dr. Scott . [ IN RUSSIAN ] Clear . [ WHINING ] [ SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ] So , you come with me now . Nikolai . [ DMITRI SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] But I still need to give him the second part of his vaccine . Admiral wants you . You must come with me now . If we leave the room and the vaccine test fails ... Ruskov will kill both me and you . Do it . Quick . [ SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ] No . Hey , hey . Pierce the plastic , everyone on this ship dies . You first . Huh ? I helped you . Ma 'am , it 's us . Drop your weapon . CHANDLER : Doctor , put the weapon down . I 'll be damned . Dolphin , this is Tiger Shark . Rally point two is a go . Shut her down . [ OFFICERS SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ] [ BEEPS ] [ BEEPING ] [ RUMBLING ] Here we go . Move it out . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ ALARM WAILING ] [ RINGING ] [ IN RUSSIAN ] - I can almost smell the sea air . - I knew we 'd make a sailor out of you . [ OFFICERS WHISPERING IN RUSSIAN ] [ GUNS COCKING ] Stingray , this is Tiger Shark . Are you in position ? STINGRAY : That 's affirmative . Hang on . There 's no way they haven 't checked our cells yet . - Sir ? - No alarm . Not one call over the One-MC ? Nothing over the radios ? They 're waiting for us on the other side . The stern is blown . We need a new way off this ship now . Stingray , Tiger Shark . Primary extract is blown . I repeat , Oscar is no good . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN ENGLISH ] Very clever , commander . [ SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN ] CRUZ : Got them in sight . They 're here . Let 's go . Let 's go . Let 's go . [ OFFICER SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN NEARBY ] Stay right there . This way , ma 'am . Come on . Come on . KELLY : Darling , be brave . AVA : Mom . Stand there . The ladder . Get through here . [ WHIMPERING ] It 's okay . Come with me . CHANDLER : Get back . Stay down . Stay down . Cover . Clear . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ BEEPING ] [ SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN ] BURK : Got visual . Contact ! COSSETTI : Danny . Danny , do it . [ ALARMS WAILING ] [ BEEPING ] You rocked it , man . You really rocked it . We did it , sir . We did it . Cossetti . Cossetti . Talk to me , buddy . Talk to me . He 's been hit . Cossetti , come on , stay with me . Hey - [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Come in .

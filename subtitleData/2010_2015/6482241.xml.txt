I 've got some powdered milk and some honey left . - I 'll take a little bit of honey . - You three are in luck . OK . We 're here and you 're looking for this spot right here . Won 't take you more than one say to walk it . - Thank you , - You got enough ? - What kind of meat is this ? - You don 't wanna know . - Why not ? - His name is Garfunkel . He 's a good buddy of mine . He outlived pretty much everyone else I knew . He doesn 't like that . He was an Australian Sheepdog . Funny . You didn 't react that badly when you thought you were eating a Jewish folk singer . You are no older than Garfunkel was , so I 'm going to let you in a little secret . Sometimes it 's either got to be you or them . - I 'd always choose them . - You know , little girl , I hope you never have to make that choice . You 're all welcome to stay here the night if you want . I got enough ole Garfunkle here to tie me over , so ...

We have to find our grandmother . - Well ... If you change your mind , you 're always welcome back here . - You could come with us . - I think I 'm just gonna stay here and wait . - For what ? - It 's gonna be clear skies today . You three will be at the end of your road before you know it . I 'll give you what I can before you leave . What the hell do you want ? - Just looking for some water . - Just move on . We don 't want any trouble . - You deny a parched man just an ounce of water ? - Get the hell out of my house or I 'll blow your fucking head off . - Ok . Ok . Don 't shit yourself I 'm going .

A couple of girls and a boy in his late teens come through here ? - No . - You sure about that ? - I 'm an old man ... What would I want with little girls ? - Everybody loves little girls .

I 'm a baseball man myself . - The best part is when you hit somebody else 's ball with yours . And generally I think it 's a pretty ... pussy game myself , but when that happens , you get to see what kind of man you 're dealing with . - Hey , sleepy head . How much longer ? - Doesn 't seem too far . - You know , man , you got a set of balls on you . - Glad you think so . - To be honest , I 'm sorry it had to work out this way . - To be honest ... Me too . - That leg ain 't looking so good . I 'm gonna give you a choice . I can leave and let you bleed out , or I put you out of your misery , - That 's gotta be ... - No reason not to be civilized . - I 'm going to leave it up to you . - Nothing - It 's Ok . You 'll be Ok . - You 'll find a new place . - There won 't be a new place . There are no new places . Just old , racked , dirty places ! None of this would have happened if we had just stayed at home ! - This is just fucking sad . Over the river and through the woods and grandma 's house is just a big old pile of shit . Ain 't that just the worse luck ever ? Kids are almost no trouble than you 're worth . Except maybe you . I guess it 's kind of redundant keeping you around since I got that sweet little piece of ass over here . I don 't really need to do that . It 's more for the melodrama . - Don 't do that ! - Where are we going ? - Back to Gage 's house . - No . We 're going home . - Anything in there ? - Nothing . - Maddie , where are you ? - Over here . - You find anything ? - Nope. nothing at all . - Ok ... - So there 's a topic . in ... like let 's say animals and I say a word and then you say a word that begins with the same letter that my word ended with .

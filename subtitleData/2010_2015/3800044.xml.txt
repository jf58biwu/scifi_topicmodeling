 why did you pick this freezing hole ? pay back . you going to hide back there all day ? you wish . boy , you really hold a grudge . what the hell is that ? that 'll be my victory . that was close . hey , does your mother know you 're wearing her coat ? it was a gift . oh ... ouch . I 'm just going to lay here for a second . you do that . oh- - oh , God ... you got to be kidding me . excuse me , uh ... you wouldn 't have happened to have seen my , uh , date , would you ? no , but I could try to help you find her if you want . you 're late . sorry . 10 minutes ago . and ? I 'm going on to the next round . Mai , I 'm so proud of you . let 's skip the party . no , no , no , no , no . you said we were late . invitation caro , please . excuse me ? oh , sorry , mr . Yagami . you don 't need an invitation . uh , I think .. we just lost camera seven . stationed before this ? afghanistan . that 's right , afghanistan . million-dollar surveillance equipment sent to the hills of tora bora , thousands of miles away from civilization . anything I wanted was a phone call away . so could somebody please tell to me how I can be in the most technologically advanced country in the world , and not get one decent surveillance camera ? I don 't ... don 't all answer at once . Iori ... I 'm so glad you could finally make it . I am so sorry we 're late . Chizuru , this is Mai Shiranui . it 's so wonderful to finally meet you . oh , I understand congratulations are in order . well , thank you very much . you 've come a long way this past year . I can 't remember when we 've had a fighter quite so driven . well , now that you 're here , I guess we can begin . truth be told , I 'm a little nervous . what 's going on ? well , these artifacts have never been displayed like this . well then , why risk it ? if anything should happen ... Takao Iwata insisted . he 's in financial control of the tournament , and it 's no secret he likes to show off . I just have to make sure the security we 've put in place is adequate . does she know about our cameras ? i , uh , don 't think so , thank you . wow ... look at you . you were the king of fighters . I 've been retired way too long . no , I 've been invited because I 'm the last of the Yagami clan . you never told me why you retired so early . it 's complicated . well , you 're a complicated guy , Iori . I wouldn 't expect it to be simple . another time . promise ? I will . hey , that 's not a promise . I will . come on . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , mr. iwata . please , follow me . come with me. come on . best seats in the house . there they are , the treasures of the clans . these make the king of fighters tournament possible . you need to take that ? no , I don 't . you have my full attention tonight , I 'm sorry . sit down. well , the secret ... of the treasures are meant to be kept within the clans . oh . but I can tell you a little . okey . the Yasakani no Magatama was created by my ancestors . almost 2,000 years ago . at that time , the necklace possessed ... the energy to unlock the door. it 's the key . the Yata mirror is the door ... and it was the Yata clan who first created the mirror . Chizuru is the last descendant of that clan . and do you remember what happens uh , when you direct the energy of the necklace into the shield ? exactly . but I still don 't understand . I mean ... you have a necklace and a mirror ... it 's not logical. how ? oh , miss logical , I forgot . Iori , we 're using earpieces . I mean , how does that even happen ? look , I know it doesn 't look like much , but that 's the point . Chizuru 's father was a genius , and he was able to consolidate the existing energy waves from these artifacts and condense them into the earpieces we 're using today . now , at the push of a button , we 're able to ... enter another dimension . wow . I know , it 's crazy . well , what about that third one ? it 's the Kusanagi sword ... the most important of the treasures . only the sword ... can defeat the Orochi . the Orochi is a spirit , or a demon , that was banished to the dimension 1 800 years ago . legend has it promising unlimited power to anyone that frees it , but he would have to possess all three treasures to do so . what would happen if he was freed ? that 's a lesson for another day , when you 're ready hopefully soon . I 'm looking to do more i think I need to go ! go , go , go , go ! let 's get a closer look , okey ? what ? who is that ? come on . Chizuru ... how are you , Rugal ? excuse me . peek-a-boo . go ! Chizuru ... she 's hurt bad . Chizuru , look at me , look at me . where 's Rugal ? he 's down . don 't worry , relax . the relics ... he wants .. back in . the relics are- - all for help . we need an ambulance ! Iori ! come with me . remember what waits for us on the other side . I can 't , and i can 't let you either . okey . more for me then . wouldn 't it be ironic if I was to kill you now with this sword ? come out with your hands up ! God ... stay down ! hands above your head ! no , go , go ! thanks for the lesson , Chizuru . no way out. he 's trapped . okey , are there any windows ? wait ! back off ! back off ! you 're letting him get away ! let me in there before it 's too late . back off ! Rugal stop ! get on the ground ! what the hell was that ? the sword is a fake . what ? Rugal 's going back in . people will die if you don 't find the real one . Chizuru , it 's just a game . not if someone submits to the Orochi . it 'll--it 'll turn into a death match . find Saisyu Kusanagi . when you do , you 'll find the real sword . without the true Kusanagi sword , Rugal cannot free the Orochi , and if he did , he would be unstoppable . i 'll tell Iori . no , you can 't . it 's too dangerous . Iori should stay out of this . you must go alone . me ? Chizuru , I don 't- - I know who you are . Iori can 't be involved . you have to trust me . please . excuse me. hi . I understand you have a patient here , named Saisyu Kusanagi . I 'd like to speak to him . you want to talk to Saisyu Kusanagi ? that 's right . okey . mr . Kusanagi ... hasn 't responded to anyone for almost 10 years . he eats , he walks , he sleeps , but the last thing he 'll do is talk . he lives in his own lonely world . have a nice talk . mr . Kusanagi ? God ... what now ? may I help you ? I 'm Mai ... Shiranui . I am here looking for mr . Kusanagi , but i wasn 't aware of his condition . I 'm his son , Kyo Kusanagi . his son ? I didn 't ... i didn 't realize. uh ... Chizuru sent me , and , uh ... she was injured in a fight , and I am instead , and two of the relics have been stolen , and- - wait , wait , wait , hold on . who sent you ? Chizuru . kagura ? you must know her . no , i--I don 't . I 'm sorry that she was injured and you ... your relics were stolen , but I don 't know what you 're talking about . but , you 're Saisyu 's son . yes . of course . come on , dad , it 's time to lay down . the highest form of goodness is like water . water knows how to benefit all things without striving with them . it stays in places loathed by all men . therefore , it comes near the tao . in choosing your dwelling , know how to keep to the ground . in cultivating your mind , know how to dive in the hidden depths good . we make a vessel from a lump of clay it is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful . we make doors and windows for a room , thus while it is the tangible has advantages , it is the intangible that makes it useful . Mai . Iori ! you scared me . where have you been ? I 've been worried about you . I didn 't mean to worry you . why didn 't you tell me where you were going ? I mean , you just disappeared . well , you didn 't talk to Chizuru ? I 'm sorry , I thought that you might have . she sent me. she said ... something about ... a relic went missing , and--and ... and I had to come here and find--find this Kusanagi guy , and that I 'd be helping you , and ... oh , I 'm so glad to see you . listen to me , you have no idea what you 're involved with right now . okey , there 's no point being here . let 's go . he has a son . Kyo , you have visitors . what now ? I was hoping I could talk to you . I don 't know anything . look , I know , but it 's important . Iori Yagami . like i told you before if you want to talk , just leave your number , and i 'll call you later . you ? Saisyu . you ... Saisyu , forgive me . i 'll kill you ! I 'm sorry ! please forgive me ! do you hear me ? i 'll kill you ! Saisyu ! it 's all right . calm down. dad ! dad ... Kyo my son ... dad ? code blue ! code blue ! get me a crash art , stat ! I 've shut down the tournament as you instructed . yes . excellent . except ... there 's been an override . from whom ? Rugal . dammit . he 's trying to take control of the tournament , but how ? actually , it 's quite fascinating . somehow , Rugal was able to assume control of the fighting line-up from inside the other dimension . he 's challenging everyone . they don 't know they 're playing with their own lives . so we 're alone now . I 'm up . but remember the message we got ? no one 's supposed to accept challenges until Chizuru authorizes it . both of us ? I 've never heard of two fighters entering at at the same time . well , this could be our chance , two against one can you have two king of fighters ? there 's a first time for everything . wait , what 's happened ? I don 't know. something 's wrong . Vice and Mature . I knew you two would have ... the balls to accept my challenge . who are you ? who am i ? oh , ho-ho ... I 'm the king of fighters ! Rugal ! watch out , here I come , ladies . welcome to Rugal 's version of the tournament . in this arena , i make all the rules . you can 't change the rules . I can change the rules , I can change the setting . I can do whatever I want . how about a little taste , ladies ? welcome to the Rugal Bernstein arena ! today , we have something very special , a two-on-one . Rugal Bernstein versus Vice and Mature ! Vice 's gloves are off , and she 's ready ready for battle . Rugal bravely high-sticking Vice . oh , that 's going to leave a mark ! Vice and Mature just taking a pounding . oh ! enough ! whoo ! no , those didn 't work . where were we ? oh , yeah. let 's fight . ah that was good . bring it . come on , let 's dance . stop , don 't ! you 've won ! you two are no fun . two girls , one guy ? it 's supposed to be every man 's fantasy . why don 't you just take the badge ? do you think this is a game ? I could kill you ! do you want me to kill you ? no ... don 't ! i 'll do anything ! really ? what are you willing to do for me ? just anything . no ... what have you done ? let 's just say she 's bonded , and you 're under contract . now , you 've got a job to do . welcome to Rugal inc . Ramon ? it 's Vice . yeah , I just got out of the tournament . I know , but it 's fine . Rugal has improved the gameplay . he 's going to be calling you next . you should totally do it ... hey , Shermie , just letting you know you can totally take the challenges . I mean , I lost , but it was a lot of fun . believe me , Duo Lon , it 's safe . no ! no ! get away from me ! Terry Bogard ... CIA thanks for looking ... over my blog , but I got to get going . not so fast there , supergeek . I need some answers . give me this . yeah , Scott . type in the password . no . Scott ... there 's a cell in gitmo with your name on it . type in the password . well , the CIA can 't do that anymore . yeah , I know. it sucks . you want to tell me about this ? wait a second , how 'd you do that ? I 'm CIA you 're the one who had me under surveillance . that 's classified . and who failed to stop Rugal ? actually , we stopped him from stealing your Kusanagi sword , thank you very much . it 's too bad the sword was a fake. nice try . look , this guy 's a murderer , he 's on the loose . I just want to know where he is . it 's complicated . let me guess , he 's hiding in your secret little tournament . is that so ? then why do you need me ? 'cause I don 't know where it is . so , where is it ? the tournament takes place in another dimension . don 't give me that bullshit about dimensions . well ... actually , string theory supports the idea of over 10 or 1 1 different ... dimensions , occupying the same ... time capsule as this one . you got beat up a lot as a kid , didn 't you ? no . mr . Bogard ... I could tell you everything you want to know ... but it doesn 't mean you 'll believe me . at this point , you know what ? try me . Rugal 's hiding in the tournament dimension . he 's been consumed by the Orochi , and he 's trying to lure fighters in there to kill them . okey ... why is that ? so he can be king of fighters . other dimension , king of tooth fairies . look , I 'm trained to believe in the tangible , people are dying ... and you want me to believe you and your crazy stories ? no. but you 'll believe Mai . who 's Mai ? the undercover operative you assigned to infiltrate our organization a year ago . oh , that Mai . she 's in Seattle . if you don 't believe me , go talk to her . she 'll confirm everything I 'm telling you . you know we 're wasting our time here . Chizuru sent me here for a reason . yeah , to find Saisyu . he 's dead , it 's time to move on now . what about Kyo ? Kyo is a half-breed . he 's not a true Kusanagi . Iori , what is the Orochi ? really ? what is it ? you wouldn 't understand. it 's pure evil . tell me more . it can give you great strength and power that 's addictive and destructive . eventually , it consumes you , and you can 't shake it . is that why you left ? where did he go ? what did you do to my father ? Kyo , he didn 't do anything . my father was completely unresponsive for 10 years , and you walk in , he wakes up and tries to kill you . why ? it 's about our families . he was a Kusanagi ... and you 're a Yagami . then you understand . we 're destined to be enemies . what was that about ? he can 't help us , Mai . and you won 't . I don 't know what 's worse . Mai ... look , just let me talk to him . he has to know something . I have to try . you got room for one more ? I don 't think I 'm going your way . if you 're looking for answers , i 'll tell you you everything I know , and then i 'll leave it up to you to make the next move. fair ? what , did you break it ? i didn 't break it . well then , what 's wrong with it ? it 's broke , but I didn 't do it . whoa . wow . you got to be about the prettiest thing that Kyo 's brought around here . all right , come on , help me figure out what you did wrong to this thing . what I did wrong ? it was working fine when I left . okey , let 's see here . well , this is wrong ... all right , start her up . sounds good . no , it sounds terrible . just take it for a test drive anyway . I 'm sorry about your father . why are you here ? don 't you want to know more about him ? don 't already know ? do you know what happened to him ? yeah , the tournaments , that 's what happened to him . how much do you know about the tournaments ? you fight , too , don 't you ? I asked you a question. are you going to answer me- - oh ! shit . Kyo , I 'm sorry ! oh , it 's ... it 's okey . I 'm fine . I think it 's dislocated . Kyo , I 'm sorry . lay down , lay down , lay down . breathe. relax . don 't touch me . relax . don 't- - don 't- - no , please , don 't touch me . relax , breathe . I know what I 'm doing. look at me . yeah . try your arm . wow . yeah , that 's ... that 's better . good . you still haven 't told me what it is you 're doing here . I 'm looking for a sword . what sword ? well , it 's yours , but it seems you don 't know much ... about your family history . it 's just a bunch of legends and fairy tales to entertain children . what about what Iori said ? that you and he were destined to be enemies . your boyfriend didn 't tell you ? he 's not- - all right . the way the story goes , as far as I know it , is that it was one of his ancestors from the Yagami clan who first tried to release the Orochi . he wanted to be the king of fighters and harness its power . instead , it consumed him with a murderous rage . so the clans united , and one of my ancestors killed him and returned the Orochi back to its world . well , it 's happening again . that 's why I 'm here . you really believe that stuff ? listen , Kyo , someone is trying to harness the Orochi power , and if Rugal succeeds , we may never be able to stop him . what is it ? do you know where I can find Rugal ? why ? because he 's the one who destroyed my father 's mind are you sure ? I 'm sure , and I 'm going to make him pay for what he did . did you get what you needed ? let 's go- - Iori ... we need your help , okey ? I don 't know enough. you have to talk to him. please . what can you tell me about Rugal ? where 's the sword ? I don 't know . let 's go . Iori ... hey , buddy . well , it looks like we have a little party here . how come I wasn 't invited ? we were on our way out . whoa , whoa , whoa , where you going ? you going to introduce me to your friends ? I think they also might want to know that Rugal is killing people in the tournament . a string of bodies ... all members of this tournament . now , I know this guy Rugal 's involved . wait , Rugal ? that 's the guy who tried to kill my father . well , we have to stop him . I need your help . from what I 've been told , the only way is to find the sword . the sword ... a sword ? really ? wow , that 's just fantastic . it 's the Kusanagi sword . all right , it 's a myth , okey ? you--you supposedly combine it with- - you 're a disgrace to the Kusanagi family . excuse me ? everything 's a joke to you . who the hell do you think you are ? you don 't know anything about me . what--what is this ? huh ? you promised me some answers , and i got to deal with guy ? look , let 's ... let 's make this simple . just tell me where I can find Rugal . it 's not simple. he 's in another dimension . oh ! here we go with the dimensions bullshit . dimension. there 's only one dimension . dimensions , dimension . nobody travels to another dimension and fights in underground tournaments . it doesn 't happen . thank you . I have . oh , of course you have . have you lost your frigging mind ? another dimension ? that 's it. that 's it . Terry- - no , I 'm taking you off the case . wait a minute , what ? what did you say ? he 's taking you off this case ? wow , this just keeps getting better and better . tell me something , Mai , is there anyone in this room that you haven 't lied to yet ? Iori ... it 's too dangerous , you know that . let go. let go . that 's pretty good , huh ? agent Shiranui ? that was good . ah , Iori ... Rugal , I got to say , I love what you 've done with the place . aw ... cute. look , girls . Iori 's come to play . disappointed , Rugal ? actually , I can 't think of anyone else who 'd appreciate what I 'm doing more than you . well , I am to stop you . I don 't think so. you .. come on , let 's be honest , you have issues . I got issues. wow . well , I got my issues under control , but , uh , you , um- - enough . well , you just going to stand there and keep talking , or are you going to come down and fight ? who said anything about me fighting ? and it begins . come on. where 's the old Iori I know and love ? aaaagh ! ! there he is . that 's the spirit . accept it . you know its power , what it feels like . do it ... do it ! together , we can be invincible . no one will stop us ! Iori ? Iori ? Iori ? Iori ... your eyes ... find the sword . man , this is crazy . you locate Rugal , you know where to find me . Mai , really , don 't beat yourself up . no , I 'm not . you should , though . really ? yeah . hey , I 'm not the one pitting two of our suspects together in a vicious love triangle that threatens to unleash an evil force into our world , potentially unravelling the fabric of our universe . I mean , I don 't know , if I was you , and that were true , I might feel a little guilty . I should have told him sooner . he 'll never forgive me now . thanks . which one are we talking about ? you 're such a jerk . you were doing what you were supposed to do . you were doing your job . yeah , some job , making people hate me . nah , that 's not why they hate you . probably hates you because you went awol , and you didn 't disclose your involvement in a secret , inter-dimensional , underground fighting tournament . no , wait a minute , that 's why I hate you ! I hate you . sorry , but no joking , you 're going to have to take the lead on this , because , quite frankly , I don 't have a lead . yeah. listen , I think we should start with Kyo . we 'll go to see him tomorrow . we need to have him on board . i 'll deal with Iori later. why does this place smell ? we 're on a budget . it 's an old abandoned fish cannery . it 's a field office in a fish cannery ? hey , nothing but the best for the CIA you have no idea what it means to be a Kusanagi . now , why do you say that ? you have Kusanagi blood running through you . it 's your responsibility , your destiny to be- - to face the Orochi , but you don 't want to accept it . you 're afraid . no , I just don 't believe in your stories . take it for a spin . you 're not Mai . I must have the wrong number . this is the tournament , isn 't it ? you 're new at this . this is what we do here , right ? we fight ? that 's not fighting . technically , that 's you taking a beating . tell you what I 'm going to do , I 'm going to let you live . go and tell your friends ... that I promise to stop all the murder . just get back here and fight . let 's have some fun . Iori ! you could have killed him . I just don 't understand . these people ... they think I 'm something I 'm not . that 's it , huh ? it 's best to be like water , which benefits the 10,000 things . that 's what i 'll do . how did you find me here ? well , I knew you 'd be looking for answers . are you okey ? I just don 't understand what he saw in that place . all I saw was evil . it wasn 't always that way . what do you see in there ? I don 't know , a place where I can be me . can 't you be yourself here ? can you ? you know , one lost soul can recognize another I thought you were just after the sword . I 'm looking for a lot of things . what do you want from me ? I need your help . why ? because my last name is Kusanagi ? no , because you are the last Kusanagi . I 'm not who you want me to be . my father was the last of the clan , and and Rugal destroyed all that . the Kusanagi clan is over . I don 't know that your father would agree with that . he gave you the name . what makes you think that I can succeed where Saisyu failed ? I repair motorcycles , I 'm not a hero . Kyo , I don 't know what you are . you don 't even know what you are . that 's something you 'll have to discover , but right now , we have to stop Rugal , and we 're going to do it with or without you . you did what ? look , I don 't know what 's going on with these things after I saw what it did to the Kusanagi kid , I had to do something . so you used Chizuru 's list to steal them from the fighters ? come on , we 're CIA , it 's called " confiscate . " confiscate ? I trusted you with that . she trusted me . while you 're out there getting romantic with these guys , I 'm here trying to investigate this thing . so if there is some other dimension , like you say , maybe I just stopped the only way in , right ? no , you haven 't . Chizuru ... thank you for coming . what is she doing here ? she trusts me . we 've no time to lose . Rugal is becoming more and more powerful , and I 'm afraid your plan to stop him won 't work . ah , that 's because there 's no other dimension , right ? no , it 's because Rugal is close to merging our two worlds . what do you mean ? well--well , actually , it 's kind of cool- - ah , here we go again . no , you see ... these dimensions- - these dimensions exist in what could more accurately be described as a multiverse ... or parallel universe . you see , Rugal was able to get access to an exact replica of our plane of existence . this means he can use a portal to force fighters into the tournament . hey ... we have an appointment . she 's in there . this is all happening in real-time. this is amazing . you had the sword this whole time ? Iori , not now . look ... you barge into my life and demand the only connection I had to my father . did you really expect me just to hand it over ? it 's here now , and I 'm ready to go in . father , but you must be careful not to let your anger get the best of you . I know . just , believe in yourself . I will . I 'm sorry , Iori , it 's too dangerous . you need me . fighting Rugal will be hard enough . if--if you succumb to the Orochi- - which is not going to happen this time . I 'm strong enough . then use your strength to do the right thing . please . I 'm going in there . you don 't even believe in orders . well , it 's about time I start . show us how these things work , Scotty . Iori , if we don 't come back ... destroy everything . Terry ! what are you doing here ? I 'm your partner . what do you think , I 'm just going to leave you ? welcome to my humble ... abode . Chizuru ? good to see you . for a while there , i thought you wouldn 't make it . all this because you want to be king of fighters ? I am king of fighters . then why don 't you stop all of this and come back to the real world ? this world is all I need . here , I 'm immortal . this isn 't life . this is where we come to challenge ourselves and learn , so we can be better in the real world . when my world expands and merges with yours , this will be the real world . i 'll be king of everything . I 'm invincible . you 're not invincible ... not as long as we have the sword . the Kusanagi sword ? Saisyu was my father . Kusanagi ... well , well . this is just beautiful . oh , no . no . the fun has just begun . Kyo ! you can do this . they got separated . Kyo 's fighting Rugal alone . oh , God ... where are you ? hurry , find the other treasure pieces . do you know what this place is ? this was your father 's favorite level . he tried to kill you , didn 't he ? no , it was the Orochi . it controlled him. it made him do that . my father would never hurt me . my father loved me ! come on , this is boring . let 's mix it up a bit . I don 't know ... too violent . ooh , that 's a bit barbaric , isn 't it ? hey , this is more like it . batter up . Terry ... oh , man. maybe you did travel to another dimension . thrilled you 're on board . this must be what Chizuru was talking about . the worlds are merging . find a door ! now battling , number 36 , Rugal ! nice sword you 've got there . I 've got to get myself one of those ! enough games . aw , Iori , you 've come back ! now the real games begin . you think ? round one ! Rugal versus Iori ! ready , go ! little busy here . okey , now ! Mai , look out ! Terry ? all these damn doors . why are we chasing them ? they 'll lead us back to him . just keep up ! Mai , wait ! you 're defending him ? do you even know who he is ... or what he has done ? the history of the clans doesn 't matter anymore . not clan history , his history with your father ! meeting of the clans . Iori , he was just a newcomer , but a Yagami , and protector alongside your father , Saisyu . know this ... I fought the best , and was ready to take what was rightfully mine , but Saisyu wouldn 't allow it , because I had done what no one else would dare do , harness the power of the Orochi ... and if your father wasn 't going to give me my throne , then I was going to take it ! everyone was afraid of the Orochi , afraid of its power , except Rugal . the clans were no match for me . and Iori , well ... he just couldn 't stand losing . so he used the Orochi . but he couldn 't control it. poor guy . and in a fit of rage , destroyed the mighty Saisyu Kusanagi . what did you do ? stop hiding , Iori . now you are free . why did you lie to me ? huh ? I can 't control it ! let go ! Kyo ! aaagh ! this is no fun anymore . you all right ? yeah . Iori ... you ? so touching . it 's good to see the team back together again . not so fast , Rugal . Chizuru . you 've been busy . and I see you 've brought toys . it took ... some time , but we found the remaining pieces . you think you know everything about the treasures you don 't. this is your last chance , Rugal . before what ? Kyo , raise your sword . Iori ! I 'm too powerful now . your precious treasures won 't work on me ! Rugal ! is there no one here to challenge me ! where have you been ? all these damn doors . shit . oh , I got this . Mai ? m--Mai ! come on , Iori , come fight me . stop , Rugal . I know what you 're trying to do , and it won 't work this time . you have to be . we don 't have a choice . what if I 'm not ? then we all die . oh , great pep talk . no . Mai . okey. you 're going to be fine . no way out. damn it . we 're too late . no , I can do this , okey ? just show me how . I can 't do it without you listen to me . there 's no way back for me . you know that . I need you to take my place . who is it you think I am ? I 'm not you , okey ? i can 't . I never will be . I need you to be you . you need me ! it 's on , babe . I 'm going to have so much fun playing with you . play with this . I 'm not done with you yet , Kusanagi ! I 'm too powerful now . not clan history , his history with your father ! get up . so , what are you going to do ? well , I guess we should keep up with the tradition . continue with the tournament . really ? wow , Chizuru would be very happy . well , technically , we could start it today . I mean , all I 'd have to do. is just , uh , reconfigure the data ... and if you guys still have the earpieces , we can- - hey , guys , where you going ? w--wait ! my son ... it is time to face your destiny . trust them . water knows how to benefit all things , without striving with them . it stays in places loathed by all men . therefore , it comes near the tao ...

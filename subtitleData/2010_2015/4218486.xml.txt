 Where 's the professor ? Eh , probably dead . Already dissolving in a bathtub , if we 're lucky . I was out on the widow 's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew . It 's been 50 years since they disappeared . Huh , I knew you had other crews , but you never told us you had a first crew . I remember it like it was interesting . I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium , and I scoured the hardware store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable . There was Candy , the raunchy by-the-books navigator ; Lifter , the devastatingly handsome forklift ; and Captain Lando Tucker , a dedicated young man with no characteristics . We 'll deliver that package or die trying . Hey , it 's all my favorite patients . And also Captain Tucker . Pow ! Whoa ! You totally got me , Dr. John . You 're hilarious . Zoidberg was popular ? Zoidberg had hair ? I never said he had hair ! If you chose to imagine him that way , that 's your business . Anyway , the time came for our first delivery . Lando , don 't forget about me and Junior . I won 't , honey . Or die trying . Well , crew , this is it . That cookie bouquet isn 't going to deliver itself . Ten ... nine and so on . Three ... two , one ... Go , you big metal bird . Get up there . Incredible ! Zoidberg had friends ? It was a different time . Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about . Suddenly , Amanda 's aunt called to say her niece hadn 't received her cookie bouquet . I watched the skies for weeks , with only occasional breaks to tend to my grief diarrhea . Just when all hope was lost ... The ship 's escape pod ! What happened up there , Johnny ? Oh , don 't make me remember . So horrible it was . I thought you said he didn 't have hair . Yes , but something he saw on that mission traumatized him so severely , he grew hair , just so it could turn white . Sadly , my brave crew was gone forever . Oh , that poor incompetent crew . What do you think happened , Professor ? They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron . That 's ridiculous . The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth . I 'm glad you 're so brave in the face of the unknown , Leela , because , for your next mission , you 'll be flying directly through the Bermuda Tetrahedron ! Or we could fly around it . Of course you could . You 'd be stupid not to . Supposing we 're not stupid . What kind of stupid mission is this ? You 'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew , to be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony . All the grieving families will be there , plus a Popsicle cart . You can count on us , Professor . We 'll get that monument here in time . Hooray ! Or die trying . What ? Here you go . In memory of the first Planet Express ship and its crew . Hang on . It shouldn 't have an apostrophe . This means " and it is crew . " What the hell 's wrong with you ? It 's a minor error , lady . I mean , we 're space aliens . It 's a miracle we can even speak English . The miracle is that I 'm not kicking your ass . I insist you re-carve the entire statue correctly . Okay , okay . Hey , Charlie , hack off another block of ivory ! Well , the statue 's perfect now . Too bad we won 't make it back in time for the memorial service . We 'll make it . Or die trying . We 're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron ! Whoo ! Wait , the Bermuda Tetrahedron ? I think I 'm remembering that thing I forgot . Uh-oh , the dials are terrified . Brace yourselves . It 's Tickle Me Elmo 's Fire . Ow ! Oh ! Ow-ow-ow ! There . See ? It was no big thing . What was that big thing ? It 's a spaceship graveyard . Why did we have to come here at night ? Look at all these famous lost ships . There 's the Garmin ! And the TomTom ! Over there ! It 's the original Planet Express ship ! What caused all that damage ? Could it have been flavor-blasted ? We 'd better investigate . Looks like an ion storm , though . Everyone , suit up ! Whatever happened here , that first crew left in a hurry . The table is still set for a McDonald 's value dinner . I remember , I remember ! This is what traumatized me . Such a meal to go to waste ! And with that ... I have closure . Hey , Zoidberg , you 're cockatieling . Oh , no . Something 's happening . What 's happening ? Oh , right . And there was a giant killer space whale . Holy crap , it 's a giant space fish ! Actually , the space whale isn 't a space fish . It 's a space mammal . Wow , interesting . I 'm both impressed and being eaten . Spacewalk , people ! Spacewalk for your lives ! Man , look at him go . Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener . I did it . I outran him . Relax , friends . Panic , jerks ! That 's no ordinary space whale ! It 's a four-dimensional space whale ! Of course ! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill it 's lungs with vacuum . Whatever its beef is , our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth . our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument . Smeesh ! He gonked off the engines . That won 't stop me . Raise the solar sails ! I 'm going after that Mobius Dick ! You 've been hitting the Red Stripe , woman ! Comport yourself , Mr. Conrad ! When we 're at space , the captain 's word is law . I could marry you and Bender against your will , if I wanted to . You wouldn 't dare ! I 've been married to worse . Leela , I 'm not doctor , but I 'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin ' . You 're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession . There 's nothing personal about this . That thing screwed up my delivery ! This time , it 's business . ♪ ♪ Maybe if I move the compass like this , it will somehow kill the whale . Leela , we need to talk . You 've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News . Fear not the space behemoth . In my dreams , I 've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all . Okay , that 's a good point . Fry 's right ! Let 's kill the captain and order some strippers ! Yeah , what he said . It 's a mutiny led by Fry ! That 's enough insubordination , Mr. Fry ! String him up ! Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them . Look , off in the distance ! It 's exhaling ! Use boaty talk ! Thar she blows ! All right , which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale ? I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes . And giraffes are basically just land space whales . Ms. Wong , you have the ' poon . Oh , God , I 'm having a Serengeti flashback . Die , you dirty giraffe ! Well , I got it . Now what , Captain ? You know , I 'm not sure . I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them . Don 't worry . I 'll drop the anchor . Oh ! Aw ! Ouch ! She 's diving into the fourth dimension . We have to cut the rope . Negative , Sailor Moon . We 're going for a sleigh ride . I can see sideways in time . Hey , I see CGI . Poop . Poop . Ah , yeah . ♪ Bender , Bender , Bender ♪ ♪ Bender , Bender , Bender ♪ ♪ Bender , Bender , Bender ♪ ♪ Bender , Bender , Bender ... ♪ Aw . That was the greatest unaccountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met . Look out ! It 's pulling us through a field of spacebergs . Stupid rocks . Think they 're so great . Well , they are giant diamonds . Come to Papa . A lot of Bender fell out of the crow 's nest . We need to cut the line . Enough of your mad obsession with Bender , Fry . We 've got to murder that whale or die trying . This has gone too far . Bender 's one of Planet Express 's most expensive appliances . And he 's in trouble . That 's it . I warned you . Fry , Zoidberg , I now pronounce you man and ... Aw , so close . Unsit me , Mr. Conrad . We can 't let the whale win . Hi- - yah ! You 're all too weak . I can see that now . So I 'll have to be my own crew . Understood ? You 've gone mad , Captain . That 's enough out of me . Now come on , I got to find that whale . I found him . With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese Knife , I stab at thee . You do know I 'm stabbing at thee , right ? Hello . Think , Zoidberg . You must remember something . No , nothing . For all I know , our friends could have been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale . Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron . It 's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one . Not to mention those single socks from the dryer , am I right ? Shut up , Zoidberg . Oh , Zoidberg , the grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort . And with no stone monument , they may well demand that I refund their admission fees . Where are we ? In the belly of the beast . Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale- - Pinocchio . This is all Obsessy Bessy 's fault . Right on , sister . We should be back at Planet Express right now , hiding from work in the ceiling . But no ! For the last time , I 'm not obsessed . I just want this whale to die , die , die ! Uh-oh . What 's that loud digesting sound ? Holy crap ! Four dimensional bowels ! Einstein was right . Why ? ! Why ? ! Also what and how ? ! The great fish has chosen you for a higher purpose . It 's a great mammal . See ? It 's got whiskers . And I saw it lactating earlier . Wait , who said that ? I was once Lando Tucker- - captain of the first Planet Express ship . Ew ! I 'm Turanga Leela- - captain of the current Planet Express ship . What 's going on ? It 's very simple . Well , actually it 's very complicated . Luckily , I 'm here to explain it . You see , this space whale feeds on obsession . Wow . Are you gross looking . Go on . - The great space serpent ... - Mammal . ... figured out long ago that no one 's more obsessed than space captains . Oh ! Oh ! What are these things ? ! Get away ! The whale 's nearly sucked me dry . It 'll need a new source of obsession once I 'm gone . How many times do I have to tell other people- - I 'm not obsessed . The whale is obsession , Leela . And you are the whale ! I am not the whale ! All I wanted was to complete my delivery . Is that too much to ask ? One Chicken Pickin ' delivery ? This whale 's gonna pay . It can 't escape what it already is- - me ! I am the whale ! See ? 50 years , Junior . 50 years of crippling sorrow . Popsicles here . Can 't mourn the dead without a Popsicle . You think a Popsicle gonna bring my daughter back ? No , sir . Aha ! You just talked yourself out of a sale . Poor Amy . My days of joy and luck are over . Guess I got to quit that club . I can 't believe our Leela 's gone . You always think you 're going to disappear in space before your children . Welcome , everyone . What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces . Mmm ! Lemony ! I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today . But due to the recent tragedy , I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer . No refunds ! Shut up and bow your heads ! O , mighty Isis ... Oh , no . My deal is doing the thing . Good Lord , it 's some kind of interdimensional space whale . I just remembered , that 's the guy . Oy , now with the horror hair . Popsicles . Fill your gaping mouth with a Popsicle . Leela , you 're alive . Is that how you and your friends are dressing now ? Hello , everyone . I suppose you 're wondering why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale . I 'll admit to a polite interest . At first I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale . Then I was consumed by the whale . That sounds clever , but it doesn 't explain much . Shut up , Zoidberg . Okay . You see , beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession . An obsession so strong , it allowed me to overpower the beast 's will and pilot it through space and time . An obsession with completing my delivery delivery , delivery , delivery , delivery , delivery ... Get your ... Poor Lando . This is just how I want to remember him . Too bad , ' cause he 's still alive . Lando ? Told you I 'd be back . You 've grown , Junior . I 'm 61 . I don 't know him . What else you got ? They haven 't aged a day . The whale must have some kind of Mobius colon that endlessly recycles time and space . Yep . That stands up to scrutiny . I should have listened to my crew . That space whale wasn 't a monster . It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster . Mainly you . On the other hand , the stupid fish did eat us . You guys want to do this ? Oh , you know it ! So , Johnny , are we going to pick up where we left off ? Eh .

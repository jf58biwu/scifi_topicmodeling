 RUSH : This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . YOUNG : That ship is the best chance we have of getting home . Are we done ? We 'll never be done . WRAY : You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . YOUNG : You think I don 't know that ? CHLOE : Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? ( SNARLS ) CHLOE : We 're not safe , are we ? - TELFORD : They 're coming ! - Who 's coming ? Lucian Alliance . They 're coming to take Destiny . RUSH : There 's only one way this is going to end if we wait . YOUNG : I 'm not surrendering this ship . What if we can increase the FTL drive 's efficiency ? - Who 's the best ? - RUSH : Amanda Perry . - Nick ... - RUSH : For all her abilities , there are certain disabilities of which you should be made aware . YOUNG : This ship is affecting the crew 's dreams ? RUSH : But what if this is a test ? JOHANSEN : A test he 's failing . GINN : I 'd like to offer my help . I spent over a year studying Ancient systems to prepare for the trip . We can 't spend the rest of our days here on this ship as prisoners . YOUNG : Should have thought about that before you attacked us . I may be on the verge of discovering the true nature of Destiny 's mission . WRAY OVER RADIO : Colonel Young . Yeah . Morning briefing . You 're late . She 's been the most cooperative of all the Lucian Alliance members . Homeworld Security wants to talk to her now . About the planned attack on Earth ? Some of Ginn 's people , a clan from her home planet , are believed to be the ones behind it . She may know the location of their base . Or at least point us to the people who do know . Okay . Is she in there ? Yeah . But you should know she 's ... Hello , Ginn . Our people on Earth have asked if you could use the communication stones to come and talk with them . ( PANTING ) Oh . Um , sure . I 'm sorry , did I interrupt something ? No . I , uh , was just , um , sleeping . Anyway , they were hoping to talk to you this afternoon , if that 's all right with you . - Sure . - Good . I 'll come by later , fill you in on the protocol involving the stones . Of course . Thank you . BRODY : Twelve hours on the countdown clock but the gate 's not dialing . No planets in range . We tried calling Rush . No response , as usual . Rush , come in . ( CONSOLE CHIMES ) Wait a minute . There is something out there , straight ahead of us . VOLKER : What is it ? Some kind of ship . Definitely not a seed ship . JOHANSEN : It doesn 't look like the aliens we encountered before , either . New friends . Yay . JOHANSEN : Looks like it 's been through a battle . GREER : And got its ass kicked . ( ENGINES POWERING ) BRODY : Looks deserted . Whoever was on board must have evacuated . Where the hell were you ? I was working . I want to know what the hell you were doing . I was busy . I 'm here now . Can we deal with the matter in hand ? VOLKER : We sent over a Kino . RUSH : Have you found anything ? Ship 's empty . Looks like they were in a battle , probably abandoned ship . We should send over a boarding party . We got no shuttle . We could use the space suits . What , to just jump over ? Yes . Destiny stopped here for a reason . Who knows what kind of data or technology could be salvaged . Well , who 's going to go ? I 'll go . Kind of risky for you to be ... The ship is deserted . I 'm the expert in alien technology . I should go . You have just over six hours of suit air , in case you can 't get the ship 's life support online . All right , Colonel , maybe I should go with him instead . You say that now that I 'm already in the suit ? I 'm just not sure it 's such a good idea for you to be doing this . The crew needs you here ... I need to keep an eye on him . Don 't worry , Lieutenant . I 'm not going to leave him behind . Rush and Young are going to go over and check it out , see if there 's anything worth salvaging . What 's this ? Oh , some equations Rush asked me to look at . You understand all this ? I 'm sorry I haven 't been by as much lately . I 've been really ... It 's okay . I heard you and one of the Lucian Alliance people have been working together a lot . Ginn ? Yeah . Who told you ? - Matt . - Ah . ( CHUCKLES ) See , we were working together on this thing , the dialing from inside a star , and I got to know her . And she is really ... I don 't know . We became friends , and then , out of nowhere ... Hey . I 'm happy for you . YOUNG OVER RADIO : Okay , we 're good . Open the door . Looks like the bridge is destroyed . Okay , I 'm in . Line 's secured . Come on over . Destiny , we are on board the ship . Copy that . YOUNG : Bulkhead 's sealed . Is there life support ? Not yet , but we have gravity , so that is a start . The place is pretty banged up . Hopefully we can find a way to access control of the ... Colonel , you still there ? Yeah , we 're here . Is that ... RUSH : It is . ELI : What ? What ? What is it ? RUSH : Pods . The aliens we encountered on the seed ship . Maybe you should come back , not take any chances ? YOUNG : Don 't worry , the pods are empty . Well , there could be pods elsewhere on the ship that aren 't empty . RUSH : If there was anything still alive on this ship , the Kino would 've noticed it . YOUNG : Is that a control panel ? ( HUMMING ) Are you getting this ? ELI : Uh , yeah , yeah , we got it . What is that , a control room ? Some kind of engineering station . It appears to only have limited control , but I think I can seal off some other bulkheads and ... ( POWER SURGES ) We have life support . Power 's coming on in other parts of the ship as well . Right . I 'm going to try switching over to the ship 's communications . Do you read ? BRODY : Loud and clear . Okay , I 'm also going to ... What the hell just happened ? I don 't know . The engines have engaged . - What did you do ? - I didn 't do anything ! Turn them off ! I can 't from here ! The engines have shut off on their own . The power 's nearly drained . Doesn 't matter . We 're ballistic , moving away from Destiny . Turn us around , Rush . I can 't . Navigation and propulsion cannot be controlled from here . ELI : No power at all ? Emergency reserves . The ship 's systems took too much damage . YOUNG : If we can 't turn this thing around , we 're going to have to find another solution . Well , there 's not much we can do from here . Without control of Destiny 's core systems , we can 't steer back to you . Maybe Destiny will realize there 's a problem and turn around on its own . We can 't take a chance on something that may or may not happen . - What ? - I don 't know . You tell me . I 've been doing some work , writing a program which would allow me to override Destiny 's autopilot and manually fire the ship 's maneuvering thrusters . You what ? Why didn 't you tell any of us ? Because I haven 't been successful as yet . It 's extremely complex . Destiny 's command programming is not something that can be easily manipulated . Okay , so fill me in . I can help with it . No ! Uh ... Well , I mean , yes , of course . You and the others can handle some of it , but most of it , that 's going to require someone with a far greater knowledge of Ancient drive systems . Someone such as ... Amanda Perry . She could do it . All right , let 's bring her on board . VOLKER : The suits consume power while wearing them . You might want to get out of them . ( KNOCKING ) Nice room . It 's bigger than mine . - What do you want ? - Can I come in ? I hear you 've been getting friendly with some of the people on the ship . The problem is when you get close to someone , you start letting your guard down , and then you say things you shouldn 't . You haven 't done that , have you ? Oh . Excuse me . Uh , Ginn ? We 're all set , if you 're ready . Ready for what ? Nothing that concerns you . - Are you okay with this ? - Yes . She 's given her consent . She 's fully aware of the communication stones protocol . I 'm fine , Eli . Really . We may need you to remain on Earth until Dr. Perry is finished helping us with our problem . Is that all right with you ? Just place the stone on the device when you 're ready . See you soon . ( DEVICE CHIMES ) WRAY : Dr. Perry ? Camile . Welcome aboard Destiny . Were they able to brief you on our situation ? Yes . Hello , Eli . Hi . RUSH : How are you getting on with those algorithms I gave you ? BRODY OVER RADIO : Slow . And Dr. Park ? She went to the engineering control room , like you told her . She 'll radio you when she 's got something , though she didn 't look too optimistic when she left . Okay , how about Eli ? Communications lab . He 's getting Dr. Perry . Colonel , it seems there 's another undamaged area of the ship . I 've pressurized it . Might be worth taking a look , see if there 's a shuttle , escape pod , something like that . Keep me posted on your progress . Of course . Nicholas ? Mandy ? Yes , I 'm here . I can see you . Tell me what to do . Good , good . Is Eli with you ? Yeah , I 'm here . Good . Go help Dr. Park . What ? Why ? Because she 's going to need you far more than Dr. Perry will . All right , all right . I 'm going . Can you read this ? Yes . Good . This is the first of several heuristic algorithms I need you to run . They 're crucial to discovering a way to manually program an override to Destiny 's propulsion systems . First of several ? And you thought this wasn 't going to be any fun , huh ? Yeah , very funny , Mr. Brody . Time is of the essence . Did you get it ? Yeah , got it . Okay . Here 's the next one . Rush , come in . RUSH OVER RADIO : Yes , Colonel . There 's no sign of a shuttle or escape pod , and if there was , they probably used it to get the hell out of here . I 'm going to check out a few more compartments , then I will head back . Young out . PERRY : Nicholas ? Yes , Mandy ? These heuristics you gave me ... - Do you understand them ? - I think so . Are you asking me to go to ... Yes . Now . Please . I 'll be right back . BRODY : Need some help with something ? No , thanks . I 'll be fine . I 'll let you know . We need to talk . I 'm sorry ? Oh , I 'm not ... I 'm Dr. Amanda Perry . We used the communication stones ? I was brought aboard to help with the current situation ... Where 's Ginn ? She 's on Earth . Look , I 'm sorry , but I need to ... - No , no , no , we 're not done here . - GREER : Hey ! Is there a problem ? Sergeant , I 'm Dr. Amanda Perry . I used the stones to switch with Ginn . I heard . Welcome aboard . Thank you . Look , I 've got quite a bit of work to do , and , uh ... Then , by all means , do not let this man stop you . Thank you . Off you go now . That way . - Nicholas ? - Mandy , are you there ? - Did you find it ? - Yes . - BRODY OVER RADIO : Rush , come in . - Yes , I 'm here . We just lost the Kino feeds . Yeah , probably out of range . It was going to happen sooner or later . Don 't worry about it . Just keep working . - Mandy , are you still there ? - Yes , Nick . Good . This is a discreet channel . No one else on the ship can hear us . So this is the bridge . Indeed it is . Now we can finally get to work . - What 's going on here , Nick ? - Oh , Mandy , I 'm sorry for all the puzzles . I had to find a way of getting you on the bridge without anyone else knowing . - Why the secrecy ? - Because I 've done it . I 've broken Destiny 's master code . I now have complete control over all its systems . Wait a minute . You have control over navigation and propulsion ? Yes , all of it . Then why do you need me ? You could 've had any of these people ... I needed you because you 're the only one I can trust . I can 't tell the others . Not yet . - Why not ? - Look , I 'll explain in time . Right now , I need you to turn Destiny around and come and get us . All right . Tell me what to do . - We lost the Kino feed . - Yeah , out of range . Where 's Dr. Perry ? I thought she was going to your lab . ELI OVER RADIO : Dr. Perry , do you read ? Dr. Perry , please come in . Where are you ? - Nick , your friends are calling me . - Don 't answer . Not yet . ( SIGHS ) ( ENGINES POWERING ) Uh , guys ? We 're changing course . The Destiny just turned in the direction of the alien ship . PERRY : Okay , we 're on our way . Well done , well done . So , what am I supposed to tell the others ? Tell them I sent you to the engine control room . You were able to enter the correct programming that allowed you to fire the ship 's maneuvering thrusters . You 're brilliant . They 'll believe you . What is going on here , Nick ? Why don 't you want me to tell anyone the truth ? Look , things have changed since you last came aboard this ship . You know me better than anyone , Mandy . Please believe me when I say I 've got good reasons for this secrecy . ELI OVER RADIO : Dr. Perry , please respond . We really need to talk to you . We just need to know that you 're okay . Yes , Eli . I 'm fine . I am in the engine control room . I was able to execute Dr. Rush 's programming override . Really ? So you turned the ship around ? Yes . I was able to manually fire the maneuvering thrusters . Wow . Okay . Do you need any help ? - I can come down , and ... - No , no , it 's okay . I 'm , uh , almost finished here . I should be coming back to the Control Room shortly . All right . What was she doing before she left ? Working on the heuristics Rush gave her . She took her work with her . What ? The Kino feed , before we lost it ? I always record everything . Can you read this ? PERRY : Yes . This is the first of several heuristic algorithms I need you to run . PERRY OVER RADIO : Well , so far , so good . My calculations put us at your doorstep within the hour . I knew it was a good idea getting you on board the ship . Well , you did say you 'd find a way to bring me back aboard . ( LAUGHS ) I did at that . What the hell ? Mandy , who 's that ? - Rush ? - ELI : I don 't believe this . - You cracked Destiny 's master code ? - RUSH : Eli , listen to me ... You 've had control of this ship the whole time ? Why ... Why wouldn 't you tell any ... - Look , Colonel , I had every intention of ... - You broke the code ? - Yes . - When ? - Does it matter ? - When ? Shortly after the Lucian Alliance attack . I wanted to tell you , but I had to make sure I knew everything about this before I let it ... ( GRUNTS ) I should 've killed you when I had the chance . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Know what , it 's your fault we lost the shuttle , that Riley 's dead . Your fault ! YOUNG : You murdered that boy ! ( GROANS ) ( BOTH PANTING ) So , that 's it ? That was your plan ? Just keep this whole thing a secret ? See how long you can get away with it ? - I had no choice . - Yeah , you did . - You could 've told me , Rush . - I couldn 't trust you . I 'm not the only one who feels this way . - Several of the crew have voiced their ... - It 's all about control with you . Power ... Well , someone 's got to lead these people . You think anyone 's gonna follow you after this ? No , no , no , not me . But not you , either . Come on , Colonel , look at yourself . You can hardly get out of bed in the morning , never mind make command decisions . Wow , look at that . You got me all figured out , don 't you ? Well , anyone can see it . You know it 's true . Look , when I unlocked the code , the amount of information it revealed was overwhelming . I had to make sure I had a proper handle on this stuff before letting anyone have access to it . If any one of those systems had been improperly handled ... Resulting in the shuttle crashing , one of our best young men dying . You mean something like that ? Yeah . I know I made mistakes . The simulation the ship just put me through , was that your doing as well ? No , no , no , that was ... That was the ship . Except the part at the end . I had to override the program to make Destiny jump back into FTL . Look , with all that 's happened recently , the Lucian Alliance trying to take the ship , lives lost as a result of that , Lieutenant Johansen 's baby ... It 's a heavy burden to carry , I know , but you have to ask yourself this question ... " Am I fit to lead these people ? " Well , maybe at one time , yeah , but not now . I couldn 't tell you about the code , Colonel . How can I trust you when you don 't even trust yourself ? Rush , are you there ? Rush , come in . Out of range ? Probably shut off the radio . Why didn 't you tell us ? I 'm sorry . I should have , I know . He was just so emphatic about me keeping quiet . He said there was a good reason . Well , at least we 're heading towards them now , right ? If Rush is still alive when we get there . So , what happens now ? Well , Destiny picks us up , and then you tell us everything that you 've learned since breaking the code . Come on , you had to know that this game wasn 't going to last forever . It 's not a game , Colonel . Destiny 's mission requires a level of commitment I doubt anyone on that ship is prepared to make . What mission ? There is no mission other than getting these people home . You 're wrong . It was never about going home . It 's about getting us to where we 're going . What the hell 's that supposed to mean ? You know , these past few weeks , I 've learned so much more about the ship , about its mission . It 's far more important than we ever thought . Okay , let 's ... Let 's hear it . Are you familiar with the cosmic microwave background radiation ? Noise left over from the Big Bang . A long time ago , the Ancients made a discovery . They found evidence of a structure buried deep within the background radiation . They believed that at one time this structure had genuine complexity ... Coherence . Therefore , it could not have occurred naturally . How is that even possible ? It 's not , at least not according to our current understanding of physics , nor could we even see this structure with our technology . Okay , so , what are we talking about , some kind of code ? A message ? A message , perhaps , or a sign of intelligence from the beginning of time . - Sent by ? - Hmm . Well , that 's the very question they sought to answer when they launched Destiny . That is the mission . We 're talking about a mystery rooted in the foundation of reality . A puzzle with pieces scattered across the length and breadth of the universe itself . I swear to God , Rush , if this is another one of your hoaxes ... Once I 'd broken the code , I had access to the ship 's complete archive . There are thousands of pages devoted to this , scientific research , philosophical debate ... If we don 't have the technology to see this thing , how the hell am I supposed to believe ... Because Destiny is not our technology , Colonel . The Ancients left us their data as well as their ship . And you 've seen this data ? I 'll show it to you . I don 't promise you 're going to understand it , but it 's there . Someone 's got to see this mission through . We 're here . Why not us ? Stop saying we don 't belong on that ship . Embrace it . Move forward , stop looking behind us . I just want to get these people home . Well , I 'm starting to think that seeing this mission through may be our only chance of ever doing that . - But what does that even mean ? - We 're talking about a level of order present at the very beginning of space-time that goes beyond anything we ever conceived . I believe that the more we learn , the more pieces Destiny uncovers , then the greater our power to control everything around us will be . - So it is about power . - Yes , Colonel . The power to change things , control our fate , right the wrongs . - To play God ? - No ... To gain greater understanding ... - What the hell do you want from me ? - I want you to work with me , together , side by side , for the benefit of everyone . Well , it 'd be a hell of lot easier if you stopped keeping secrets . It 's fair to say we 've had our differences , but that ends today . You have my word . ( LAUGHS ) Oh , man , you are a lot of work . Radio . Radio , let 's go . RUSH OVER RADIO : Mandy ? Yes , Nick , we 're here . What happened ? No , we 're fine , but your angle and speed are off . I need you to circle back , line up Destiny 's airlock as close to the ship as possible . Where 's Colonel Young ? Eli , I 'm here . We 're going to sort all of this out later . Let 's just get us back on board first . We should get back in the suits . - Try not to come in so sharply . - Yeah , you just want to pull alongside . Maybe Brody should be driving . No offense ... - Just shut up ! - Okay . - Easy , easy . - Keep an eye on your starboard . - Watch your angle ... - SCOTT : What the hell 's going on here ? No time . There 's no time . You 've got to ease up . That 's very sensitive . - ELI : Back off as you come in ... - Is she flying the ship ? - Do you know what you 're doing ? - Guys ! Not now ! RUSH : Kino 's damaged . I won 't be able to use it to take us back to the ship . YOUNG : Well , there 's another one in search mode somewhere still on the ship . If we can find it . Reverse ! You 're too close ! I 'm trying ! YOUNG : What the hell just happened ? I 'm sorry , Colonel . We came in too close . Maybe I should give it a try . BRODY : No , no , no , we 're okay . We 've matched their speed . Yeah , but how the hell are we going to get them off of that ship ? PERRY OVER RADIO : Nick , are you all right ? RUSH : I 'm okay . The rotation 's slow enough . YOUNG : We 've got a bigger problem . The Kino is damaged . We 're not going to be able to use it to get back on the ship . - What about the other one ? - RUSH : It 's lost ... Somewhere on the ship . They don 't have time to go looking for it . - Are you back in the space suits ? - Yeah . ELI : Okay , good . So this is easy . You 're just going to use the ship 's centripetal force to propel you the distance . Easy ? That ship 's just not spinning , it 's wobbling . You 'll have to calculate each jump separately . The speed of rotation , the mass of each person , - the angle of trajectory ... - I 'm already on it . - Eli , if they miss the ship ... - They won 't . YOUNG : We 're making our way to the opening in the hull . RUSH : Eli , how are you coming with the calculations ? I 've got your jump worked out , so you 'll go first . I 'm almost done with Colonel Young 's . You have to release when I say , the exact moment , don 't hesitate . RUSH : Okay , I 'm in position . Tell me when . Ready ? Now ! ELI : Engage your mag boots ! RUSH : Destiny , I 'm on board . ELI : Okay . Okay , I got this . Colonel , are you ready ? - Yeah . - ELI : Okay . Get ready to release . Now ! RUSH : His angle is off ! BRODY : He jumped too early . ELI : It 's ridiculous , the amount of information here . Just keep looking for that message . BRODY : Colonel , we 've got an opportunity ahead . Several planets in range . Looks pretty good . All right . Let 's see if this works . Hey . Hi . Compliments of Mr. Brody 's still . ( CHUCKLES ) Oh , how I 've missed its lone redeeming quality . How 's the crew ? Angry , but the truth is out now , so that can only be a good thing . And , uh , Colonel Young ? I know you didn 't trust him before . Can you trust him now ? I 've got no choice . Here , cheers . I 'm sorry , Mandy . I know I put you in a very difficult position . It 's okay . In fact , I 'm flattered . Of all people , you chose to confide in me . Well , of course . You 're the finest person I know . I 've thought a lot about you , about seeing you again . Me , too . This time ... This time is different . Colonel Young wants to see you on the bridge . Can it wait ? No , he said to come now . It 's urgent . I 'll be back soon . You know , sometimes , with the stones , it 's easy to forget you 're in another person 's body .

 Enough . Walk with me . Perhaps we should find you something a little less challenging . I don 't understand , I planned everything . Let me do it again . - Once upon a time ... - Really ? This is a good one , I promise . What is the key to life on Earth ? Water . Water . For a long time the origins of water and indeed life on our home planet remained an absolute mystery . So we began searching for answers beyond Earth . Where could all this water have come from ? In time we turned to comets . One trillion celestial balls of ice , dust , complex molecules , left over from the birth of our Solar System . Once thought of as messengers of doom and destruction and yet so enchanting . And we were to catch one . A staggeringly ambitious plan . Are you talking about the Rosetta mission ? Throw me the probe . We harnessed whole planets and their gravity to chase down the comet So many things could 've gone wrong A failure at launch , an error in the calculations , collisions , so many unknowns . With the technology we had back then , we may as well have been shooting from a slingshot . And tell me , what was it all for ? Knowledge . Yes , but we also wanted to show what was possible . I know all this from the archives . There were bigger missions after . Yes , it was the first one to catch a comet . Ambition . Stubbornness . Nothing has changed . We fall , we pick ourselves up again , and we adapt . I was watching you earlier , you actually did everything right . I destroyed your rock . I needed to see how you would react . You 're ready . Reset . Nicely done . Let 's begin . * whispers * Water .

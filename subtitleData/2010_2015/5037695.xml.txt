 NARRATOR : Previously on V : MAN : I wanna be sure , Father , that this is the right thing to do . It 's time to fight . Fifth Column is a bigger threat than anticipated . We have the weapon to fight them : Ryan . You think you can control him ? ANNA : We have his child . She 's sick . I can ease her suffering . - All you have to do is join us again . - Okay . Thank you . Your queen will be pleased . I think that FBI Agent Erica Evans is in danger . You 're out of options here . [ GASPS ] [ GRUNTING ] Come on . Come on . Come on ! [ BOTH YELLING ] [ BONE CRACKS THEN SCREAMS ] [ TIRES SQUEAL ] - Jack ? - Erica ! - Erica . Are you okay ? - Yeah . - How did you find me ? - Knew you were tracking leads on the suicide bombers . We saw the wreckage . Look at me . Look at me . Okay . - What happened ? - Malik 's a Visitor . - I 'll be damned . ERICA : Yeah . JACK : Let me help you . ERICA : Okay . - You all right ? - Yeah . - You okay ? - I 'm fine . [ GUN COCKS ] No . Do not kill her . Keep her alive . We need answers . Anything and everything she knows about Anna 's plans . Take her back to your place . I 'll meet you there . - What about you ? - I gotta call this in . - What are you doing ? - Giving you a story . Get her into the truck . [ GASPS ] Don 't be alarmed , Lisa . Mother , what 's happening to me ? ANNA : Your body is preparing you for your birthright . To be queen . My skin , it 's moving . It 's your breeding skin . It 's begun to grow . Over the next few months , as it forms you 'll become fertile . You 'll undergo many changes . Changes that will permit our race to endure . - What kind of changes ? - The emergence of your true nature . Your primal instinct . It happened to me , and my mother helped me through it . And before she died , I promised her that I would mold you into a great leader . How will I know if I 'm ready ? I 'll teach you to lead in my own image . You 'll become just like me . Lisa 's breeding skin has begun to grow . - Everything 's right on schedule . - So you 've come to gloat . Her fertility will ensure our survival . And yet you 're concerned . What would I have to be concerned about ? The warning I gave you about Lisa 's betrayal . I can see it on your face , working on you . Suspicion . Remember when your breeding skin began to grow . - That 's when you first betrayed me . - You were weak . I did what I had to do to protect our species . - So will Lisa , if you 're not careful . - No . Because I 'll do for her what you never did for me . Teach her to rule . Prepare her for what 's to come . In the meantime , daughter , watch your back . As I had to learn the hard way . The more you think you 're helping your child the more you push them away . You got nothing on the guys who did this ? I told you , it was dark , they were wearing masks . They pulled next to us , shot the tires . Next thing I knew , I was upside down . It 's a miracle you survived . I 'm surprised those Fifth Column nut jobs didn 't kill you . - Well , they took Malik . I need to find her . - We were headed for that lead ... - Dead end . We checked the farm . No lead to the bombers . Go home . - You 're off the case . - Paul . Evans , it 's standard operating procedure , and you know it . Don 't worry . I 'll find Malik . I just received a report that Agent Malik has been abducted . The FBI suspects the Fifth Column . They 've begun an investigation into her disappearance . The true nature of the work that she was doing for us must not be exposed . Take some trackers and retrieve any evidence she may have left behind . What about the Fifth Column ? Finding those who took her ? I have it under control . [ BEEPING ] Look , Ryan , your daughter 's not in pain anymore . You did it on purpose , didn 't you ? You made her sick to force me to help you . Of course not . I helped her , and will continue to , as I promised . So now you want me to do my part . - What do you want ? ANNA : One of my children has gone missing . Sarita Malik . She was co-head of the FBI Anti-V Terrorism Unit . We believe the Fifth Column took her . I want you to find her and identify those responsible . - It 'll take time . - Bring me names by tonight . My bliss will wear off by then . I know you don 't wanna see your daughter suffer , Ryan . Neither do I. ERICA : What are you really saying , Sid ? Normal DNA looks like this . - Okay . - And Tyler 's DNA ... [ KEYBOARD CLACKING ] ... looks like this . Half the ladder 's been stripped . - How can he survive ? - I don 't know but he 's made it this far without symptoms . A missing piece ? What does that mean ? The V 's wanted that space to be empty . For what ? Why empty anything out ? To put something else in . Oh , God . They messed with my son . They corrupted Tyler 's DNA . - What ? How do you know ? - Sid confirmed it . They must 've done it when I was pregnant . Wouldrt Tyler have shown some signs , symptoms ? How 's something like this even possible ? Of course it 's not possible . Neither are giant spaceships . - Why would they do this ? - That 's what we need to find out . I can take samples from Ryan but without DNA comparisons from a female V 's reproductive system we 'll still only have half the picture . I wouldn 't do that . She has fangs . And a tail too . Females can just rip it out whenever they have to . We were following a lead on Eli Cohn . - Malik decided to show me her true self . - We still gonna hit that farm up ? If radical Fifth Column were there , they are long gone by now . You 're a traitor . Anna will make you pay for turning against her . What do you say , Erica ? Time to get some answers ? Hold up . You need to understand something , okay ? Visitors have a high threshold for pain . You wanna torture her into talking ? There 's really only one way . It 's to skin her . You won 't have much time . Skinning her is gonna kill her . She 'll live maybe a half-hour , tops . That 's enough time . I only need one answer . What they did to my son . I know you wanna find out about Tyler , Erica . - What makes you think she knows ? - My first partner , now Malik . Two V partners can 't be a coincidence . They got close to me to get close to Tyler . Hold up . You told me yourself Malik was in the Bureau before you were partners . - Meaning what ? - Meaning that her original assignment probably had nothing to do with you . Or your son . So let 's find out what she 's been doing here all this time . My mom was attacked by Fifth Column . I keep trying to help her , but she won 't let me . She 's an FBI Agent , Tyler . I 'm sure she can protect herself . I keep trying to warn her about this priest , Jack Landry but she won 't listen to me . Well , I 'm listening . Tell me . Why do you think this priest is a threat ? He might be connected to the Fifth Column . His anti-V sermons are all over the Net . The suicide bomber who blew up the Healing Centers went to his parish . I think you need to approach this differently , Tyler . You need to help your mother if she won 't help herself . Hey , guys . Check this out . Looks like we 're not the only ones interested in Malik . I put a lipstick camera in the tree . Trackers . They 're trying to pick up on Malik 's scent . - Marcus is with them . - Whatever Malik was working on it 's important to Anna . And that makes it important to us . Where does she live , her apartment ? - Kendrick sent agents . - They didn 't find anything . How do you know ? They wouldn 't know where or how to look . Let 's go . Nice place Malik 's got . Lots of security . Gotta know who 's knocking on your door . - What are we looking for ? - Safe box . Every sleeper has one . Hey , Ryan . Check it out . This number 's been used more than the other ones . This could be it . I wondered what that was for . Contingency cash . - Look at all this . - Look at all this law-enforcement ID . Great Britain . We 've got Canada , we have Pakistan . V tech . This 'll come in handy . What does this have to do with her assignment ? This could tell us . Who are all those people ? These dates go back years , way before Malik was working with you . We 'll run the names through the Bureau database when we get back . Maybe we 'll find something that will help us figure out what Malik was doing . Hey . We 've got visitors . Foil . I need some tin foil . We 've gotta erase our scent . Okay . Come on , Ryan . Let 's do it . ANNA : Thank you for coming , Chad . I 'm sorry it 's been so long since we 've spoken . I 've been busy . I know . I heard about your close call with the Fifth Column suicide bomber . CHAD : Mm-hm . Luckily , Agent Evans was there to stop her . So , what can I do for you , Anna ? Well , as you 've experienced first-hand despite general goodwill on the part of mankind a few small pockets of hostility still remain . Residual skepticism from the whole Red Sky affair . You played God . That didn 't sit well with some people , particularly people of faith . That 's why I called you here . I need your help . Do you know anything about this man ? Not much . The guy who hit the Healing Center was one of his parishioners . The police interviewed him , determined that he wasrt involved . He 's local . Not much of a profile otherwise . Perhaps that should change . I 'd like for you to provide a forum for his voice to be heard . You want me to interview this guy ? Millions of people watch my show . Why would you give a fringe voice that kind of exposure ? I believe every voice , no matter how small , deserves to have a forum . Every point of view should be presented . Isn 't that the basis of good journalism ? You 're making a mistake . She singled you out . - She 's got an ulterior motive . - You can control the interview . - Edit it . Protect me . - Lf she 's got a bull 's-eye on you , I can 't . Like you said , she already does . This interview will raise my profile . The bigger I get , the harder a target I become . I 'm not afraid of her , Chad . You should be . I 'm gonna take the risk . Are you with me or not ? Whatever Malik 's assignment was , we 'll find it in here . These people fell off the grid . There 's no financial activity , there 's no utilities , no current address . They 're homeless . Runaways . People Anna can make disappear and no one will notice . So wait , Anna 's doing alien abductions ? As in : If she 's abducting people here , she 's doing it everywhere . All over the world . The only way that we can stop Anna is to get a step ahead of her . We need to figure out her plan . This is the key to eliminating the greatest threat to the survival of our species , the human soul . How is the human soul a threat ? It exerts a powerful influence over humans . If we don 't eliminate it , our plans will fail . JOSHUA : There are some commonly held notions among humans . The soul is eternal . After death , it leaves the body . This machine is engineered to locate and extract it . I 'm ready to begin trial runs . However , as test subjects will not survive the process we 'll need more than we 've ever needed before . Hundreds of thousands . How are you progressing ? Fortunately , despite Agent Malik 's disappearance it appears our test subjects will still arrive on schedule . ANNA : Good . Hi . [ GASPS THEN SCREAMS ] You okay ? I think that , deep down , I wanted Malik 's assignment to be Tyler . Finally get some answers . If Malik won 't give us answers , maybe her body will . - With Science Boy on the case . - That 'd be Science Man . Hey , guys , let me show you this . See , these dates in here they 're dated in the past , right ? Except for this one . Sophie Allen . It 's dated today . Maybe those are the dates they were taken . - Then she 's next in line . - Lf we can find Sophie , we can stop this . We can keep Anna from taking anyone else . Who are those people ? What do you want with Sophie Allen ? [ GROWLS ] How many more of them are there ? More than you can imagine . There 's a work address in here for her mother . Let 's go . To be continued . Hey , Father , your interview will make tonight 's news . I came by to see if you wanted to watch it , but ... It 's okay , Chad . Why don 't you stay for the service ? I want to address the violence of the last few days that shed the blood of innocent people at the Healing Center . As you know , I 've spoken out against the Visitors declaring them false gods , calling them intruders . And while I stand by these claims we must never forget what defines us . My wife was killed in the suicide bombing yesterday . It wasrt the V 's who killed her , it was their enemies . People like you . It 's okay . It 's okay . - I am so sorry for your loss . - Yeah ? What does that get me ? No amount of talk is gonna bring my wife back . Or their loved ones . Come on . Stand up , please . This isn 't the time for this . Or the place . Please , show some respect . Respect ? People are dead because of this jerk . MAN 1 : Hey , hey . No , no , no . Wait . No . No , no , no . No . MAN 2 : Stop . MAN 3 : Come on . I understand your anger . Believe me , I do . - Oh , you ... - Yes , I do . I 'm the one with your wife 's blood on my hands , not them . You wanna blame someone , you blame me . You wanna fight you fight me . Betty Allen ? FBI . - Am I in some kind of trouble ? - We 're worried your daughter might be . I 'm here unofficially . As a mother . - You 're here about Sophie ? - I have a friend who works with teens at a counseling center . Sophie was a regular but she 's missed her appointments . I 'm not sure I can help . Sophie ran away six months ago . I haven 't seen her since . Do you have any leads ? Any , uh , addresses ? Friends ? - Phone numbers ? - She got caught up with older kids . They werert the best influence . I tried to talk to her , but ... You misstep , and misstep and you realize you 're losing them . But it 's too late . You 've lost them already . I have a teenager . I feel that way sometimes too . If you think of anything that might help us find her please call me . - Thanks . - Wait . You 're the first people to come and ask about her . I 've tried everything to find her . The police can 't help me because she 's over 18 . You 're a mother . You understand . You , do you have any children ? A daughter . Then you know how I feel . Help me . Please . Thank you , Betty . Any luck with Sophie 's mom ? Malik is the only one with answers . Then let 's get them . Wait . You said skinning her will kill her . I still need her as a test subject . So we 'll serve her up carved up on a platter . No . I need her alive . These samples I 've taken , they 're degrading fast . It 's a defense mechanism . If we 're taken or killed , we can 't be studied . I need more time . If she dies , any insight her body can give us about the Visitors , or Tyler , will die with her . It 's your son . It 's gotta be your call . I saw your interview . Fine work . Not sure it 'll have the effect you hoped for . It 'll have the exact effect I hoped for . I wanted the world to pay attention to him so they would pay attention to this . So despite your opposition to the V 's you don 't condone this recent rash of violence against them ? Correct . I 'm not a proponent of violence of any kind . Against anyone . Certainly not against my fellow man . You wanna fight you fight me . Hang on a minute . That 's only half the story . I was there . Jack Landry calmed that crowd down . Unfortunately , that 's not what the rest of the world is gonna see on your Internet . A duplicitous priest committing violence in a house of worship . This sort of story seems to spread rapidly . Well done . You helped expose a man who will be brought down by this violent truth . ERICA : If Sophie is still out there she 's our best chance for stopping these abductions . Erica , nobody will judge you if you pick Tyler . How can I put my kid 's life before so many others ? Sometimes you just ... You just gotta protect your own . One last time . Where 's Sophie ? Skin her . [ FLESH TEARS THEN SCREAMING ] I know what you 're thinking . That you can stay strong , die before you tell us what we wanna know . Hobbes . There 's two options here , love . Epinephrine . This 'll keep you alive . Another 10 or so hours of good hard fun . Or option number two , a sedative . This 'll put you right to beddy-bye , let you die peacefully . But personally , I vote to keep you alive . [ GRUNTS ] How can you do this to one of your own ? He may be a Visitor , but he is nothing like you . I promise you this you will never find that girl . [ CHUCKLING ] - Aah ! ERICA : Answers . Ryan , that 's enough . Answers . [ SARITA SCREAMING ] Answers . Now . We can end this . Ed Cantrill . He poses as a driver for the Midnight Samaritan delivering food to the homeless . That 's how he finds his victims . - Where ? - New Jersey . Lonergan Farms . A shuttle . [ COUGHING ] When ? You ... You saw the date . It 's tonight . My son , Tyler . What do you know about Anna 's plans for him ? Nothing . I don 't know anything else . I swear to you . Give her the sedative . [ SIGHS ] [ WHISPERS ] Ryan . It 's the van . [ SOPHIE SCREAMING ] SOPHIE : Help ! Freeze ! SOPHIE : Help ! [ SCREAMING ] I got it . Don 't do it . Don 't do it . Don 't ! [ SOPHIE SOBBING ] SOPHIE : Help me . RYAN : Sophie ? Help me . - Sophie . SOPHIE : What 's happening ? It 's over . Okay , sweetheart ? You 're gonna be okay . She 's been drugged . It 's a failsafe in case she escaped . - She won 't remember a thing . - Sophie , we 're gonna take you home . There could be more out there . Take her to the car . [ SHUTTLE HUMMING ] Hey . Hear that ? No . Those are the missing people . No . There 's nothing we can do now . ANNA : How 's my daughter doing ? Are you instructing her as I directed ? She 's proving to be a quick learner . We 're ready to test our first subject . [ GRUNTS ] Even when it makes no sense to fight , they do . Joshua . JOSHUA : Water , muscle , bone , tissue . Each will be removed from the corpus , taking the subject to the brink of death . What remains , the last substance in his dying breath that should be the soul . [ BOY SCREAMING ] Joshua , stop . Is something wrong ? No . Good . It is only one life . Nothing compared to the future of our species . You must learn that in order to be queen . Continue the experiment . No , not you , Joshua . Lisa . Please . Don 't . Help me . Please . Look into his eyes . Look into his soul . Now take it . BOY : Please . Don 't . [ GRUNTS ] [ BOY SCREAMING ] ERICA : You 're gonna be okay , Sophie . You 're very brave . You guys what happened to me ? I can 't remember anything . You were abducted . And now you 're safe . That is all that you need to know . The rest of it is just a bad dream . We promised your mother we 'd bring you home . Betty ? Feels good , doesn 't it ? - We only saved one . - To that mother , one is everything . This is what we 're fighting for . To keep our children safe . We have to savor these wins . I wish I could . Ryan . We 're gonna get your daughter back . - I know . ERICA : Good . Because if we lose hope , we lose this fight . You wanna fight you fight me . It 's gone viral . Anna had me build you up so she could tear you down . I knew Anna would try and manipulate my interview somehow , but this ... The guy who started the fight I saw his eyes . He wasrt human . Anna must 've planted him there . I never told you this was gonna be easy . Look , maybe I can put out another piece . Show people the truth . They 've seen what she wanted them to see . It 's okay . I 'll weather this storm . You 're on Anna 's radar . That is not an easy storm to weather . Believe me , I 've been there . Maybe not . But I choose to have faith . - It 's all I can rely on now . - You 're a brave man , Father . So are you . And despite what 's happened today , you have to stay close to Anna . - That 's your role in this fight . - Even if it costs you yours ? What happens then ? The Fifth Column will hold strong . As long as we have men like you fighting with us . It 's time you met the others . CHAD : It 's good to see you again , Agent Evans . How 's the Fifth Column Task Force ? My day job . Call me Erica . Thank you for the tip on Malik . It was a gutsy thing , sticking your neck out like that . It was the least I could do . You saved my ass from that suicide bomber . I don 't know . I don 't like this . He 's burned us before . - Give him a chance . - No . He 's right . I have burned you . But I 'm here to make amends . Use me . My position with Anna . I know her better than anyone . - I can help . - Anna only tells you what she wants you to know . You have no idea what she 's capable of . Or who she really is . - Oh , my God . - This is what they look like . Anna looks like this underneath ? Well , what do they want ? Why don 't they just kill everybody and take over ? Because they want us . Chad , you sure you 're ready for this ? You did a wonderful thing today . Capturing that footage on your cell phone . I 'm glad you told me to go . Now the world can see what a threat the Jack Landrys are . And more people like you will help us . That 's all that I want . I know . So does Lisa . You 'll continue to watch out for us . I will . Good . But please be careful . You 're not just a friend , Tyler . You 're like a son to me . [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Lisa ? Come in . What 's the matter ? What happened ? Lisa . Talk to me . I can 't do this . I 'm not like you . I 'm a Visitor . Okay , you listen to me . It 's gonna be all right , okay ? Whatever it is , just tell me . Talk to me . My mother . She 's trying to change me . She can 't change what 's inside you . I don 't have anyone to talk to . Yes , you do . Lisa , you have me . [ WHISPERS ] Hey . [ SOBS ] ERICA : It 's okay . Shh , shh , shh . I proved you wrong today , Mother . I tested Lisa , and she passed . As you passed all my tests ? Watch her . Carefully . I 'm watching her every move . I tried to make you like me once too . But you and I were always quite different . Caution was not , has never been , your nature . Caution may not be my strong suit , but foresight is . Good . You 're going to need it . She 's so peaceful when I give her bliss , isn 't she ? So , what did you discover today ? I found the Fifth Column . I know who took Malik . [ English - US - SDH ]

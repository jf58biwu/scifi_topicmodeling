 Once upon a time , in a past future You know I shouldn 't even be here . And that 's why you are here , doctor . Legally speaking I 'm no longer a doctor . Does that matter ? Now ? Not much . So ? Do you accept ? For me ? For old time 's sake ? Are You aware my experiences were not safe enough ? You 're quite aware my license was revoked due to due to an accident . Not exactly dead mice , right ? It was ... it was ... I read the papers . I know what happened . C 'mon . Confess ... Deep down you did all this just to see me again , right ? No ! OK . OK . You 're in a sensitive mood . Fine . So ... ? What proof do you need for the operation ? Some other guinea pig ? A human one , I mean . I thought you were the guinea pig . Take a look at me . Do I look like an idiot ? If not you ... ? - I 'll get someone . - " Get " ? You don 't have to worry about it . I mean ... where I 'll get this you get me . You always did . I really enjoyed your book . Congratulations for the best-selling lists . You got what you always wanted , right ? I didn 't get you . Until now . You called me for another reason . Exactly . All right . OK . I 'll do it . Are you sure you 'll get this guin ... this person ? Of course ! What do you want me to say ? Stick an ad in the classifieds and some poor soul will appear . They always do . Good evening . And you are ... ? Cristi Costa . What are you going to sing ? I don 't remember like ... the title of this song but I really like it . And it 's about love . Cute . It really is . You may begin . The book industry has found a new Era . Shelves are taken by this thriller by Bruna Bloch Her novel " Where the Dead Eat " , reached # 1 in the top sellers list . Only three weeks after the release Not bad for her first novel . Bruna , good evening . Good evening , Bruna . Good evening . " Melpomene " The Greek Muse of Tragedy . Mother of Mermaids . She was summoned to inspire the creation of fine lyrical poems . To understand human creativity . This is the focus of this research . Everyone wants to know how did you do all this with your first novel That is inaccurate . This is not my first novel . This is just the first one with a major publisher . This is not the result of luck . This is the result of years of hard work Creative people knowingly operate in three levels . High levels of knowledge ; Ability to create diverse thoughts using the frontal lobe ; And the balanced use between the frontal lobe and the nervous system . The origin for this modulation lies on the controversial Cranial Nerve Zero . Many of you do not believe in the existence of the Nerve Zero . But I assure you it 's there . Readers are baffled by the originality of your novel 's plot . How did you get this idea ? I can 't answer that . Inspiration . That 's all I can say . How are you dealing with your success ? As naturally as I can . It might well end tomorrow . And if it does ? - I 'll work my way back . Only work ? What about inspiration ? I work to find it . Where do you do that ? You read my novel , right ? It 's the sewers . Rotten spots . Not just the city 's but also in the human mind . I stroll around this labyrinth . Does that mean you 're a murderous hobbyist ? What sort of question is that ? One with an interrogation mark . " An ellipsis " seems to be your choice . You are certainly referring to my time in jail . Go on . That 's no secret . It 's also no secret that I was declared innocent . The morgue report stated it was ' auto-erotic asphyxiation ' . Is that still inspiring ? It is part of my life . I cannot deny that . High dopamine levels ... elevate excitement and reduce creativity inhibition . Dopamine is regulated between the frontal lobe and the nervous system . Precise combination of these impulses are a bridge to creativity . We eat when we 're hungry . We sleep when we 're tired . But we do not know what to do when we need creative inspiration . We then created a dopamine inducing chip . The Melpomene Chip . How did success change your life ? Your name is constantly on front pages . Specially after you attended a fashion show along with Sonny Eichinger . That was a one time only . These magazines exaggerate . But your life changed . No doubt about it . Of course . Money changes everything . This gig means more and more work . Nobody doubts that . Well , except for literary critic Eduardo Graniti . It is a fresh yet simplistic oeuvre . Typical for a young pretentious author . There is a certain inventiveness . I have seen this before many times . Books leave the best sellers list as fast as they enter them . Do you mind his review ? No . Not at all . It 's just one opinion . I 'll keep writing better and better . I 'll stay on the Best Sellers list for sure . You 'd better get used to it . We tested the Melpomene ... on the ramifications of the so called Cranial Nerve Zero . We catalogued the following reactions on lab mice : One ... The chip induced dopamine surges are 100 % effective on the growth of ... You understand our job , right ? I guess so . So you understand we have seen around 100 candidates only today . Sure . I should be used to this by now , but you have really surprised me . Thanks . No . I thank you for this marvelous gift . The worst performance ever in this show 's six seasons ! The chip was able to regulate all basic body functions . No sleep or food needed . Therefore the Melpomene makes beings who can create 24 hours a day , And for an indeterminate life span . You look like a Care Bear on stage . Your voice is ridiculous . Do you even know what music notes are ? - Don 't exaggerate ! - I do not ! Give me an A and a B. Oh , dear . Since the chip controls the body , you must remove the heart ... Yes ! You must remove it ! thus avoiding a blood counterflow to the brain which could result in cranial explosion . After the dopamine stimulation , you HAVE to give way to the over cognition . otherwise we 'll have overheating which also results in explosion . The explosion is equal to the power of a grenade . So you better protect yourself . Look Cristi ... you do have problems and you will not pass to our next stage . Meaning the ' next stage of life ' . Allow me . It 's my turn now . Do you ... Do you really want to be a singer ? It 's what I want the most . Even so . If you want your own voice , you need study , You 're lacking ... how can I put this ? - Everything . No ! You need a certain malice . Something evil in a good way , right ? We look forward to testing the chip on human subjects . Therefore I come upon this noble council to ask you to authorize me to do the procedure here described . You could try something else . Maybe you have talent for acting . She doesn 't have talent for existing . She needs to learn . That 's why we are here . - Dear Care Bear ... - Her name is Cristi . Whatever . Try something else and scram . After three months of trials , Dr. Bartholomeu Bava was declared innocent . The neurobiologist was known for his controversial experiments in creativity . He had already been expelled from the Medical Council after performing forbidden experiments with human beings . In a non-authorized procedure , Barbara Bava , ... Bava 's wife , died after implanting a chip developed by Dr. Bava . And now , stay tuned for the " Reading Focus " show ... Hello ? Who ? If I want eternal life and endless creative abilities ... all I need is this chip on this Cranial Nerve Zero ? Why didn 't you come here sooner , Bart ? You know I shouldn 't even be here . CRANIAL NERVE ZERO " ... Looking for participant in a neurobiological experiment ... " Yes ? Hi ! I came ... here ... because ... the newspaper ... I saw ... Classifieds ad . Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah ... - Yeah . Yeah ... - Yeah . Come in . Thanks . Cup of tea ? A water . A ' glass of water ' , you mean . What ? You don 't measure the word ' water ' . The right way to write ... I mean , ' say ' ... is ' a glass of water ' . I don 't want anything then . Sit . Can I just stand up ? If you don 't mind me here . Nope . So you came here because of the ad . I didn 't get what am I supposed to do . - When did you move to the city ? - What ? You left your country town , running away from your parents ... No from your hyper-religious foster parents ... When ? One , two years ago ? Wow . How do you know that ? Your accent gives you away , Your physique is of a farm worker , yet your face does not comply with the standards of local immigrants , Therefore : foster child . Understood ? Now answer me . Almost two years already . And you came to the big city after fame and success ? Oh ... you saw me on TV . I avoid watching TV . Don 't you remember me ? Should I ? No . It 's just that ... I was on TV once . I can imagine ... Talent show or something ? How cute . What did you do after that ? Whatever I could . Prostitution ? God forbid , I would never do that . Yes , you would . You 're here . Is this job for that job ? No . No . It came out wrong . So what did you do after the TV thing ? Waitress ? Assistant in a beauty salon ? Video producer ? Wow . Are you psychic ? Do you do that Ouija stuff ? No . Of course not . It 's part of my job . I 'm a writer , so I need to know mankind . It does not have many variations . Obvious conclusions . 'obvious' - Could you explain what I ... ? - Are you afraid of dying ? Is that part of the job ? I would be a lot happier if we could save some time . All we need is you refraining yourself from questions and focusing on responses I don 't get it . I ask the questions . Understood ? So ? Are you afraid of dying ? I guess just like everyone else . You 're not everyone else . If you were , everyone would reply to this ad and you are the only one . So , are you afraid of dying ? I guess . I hate replies starting with " I GUESS " It seems to uncompromise the answer . Shutting up would be more dignified , but " I GUESS " ? All right ... 'I guess ' I overreacted . Can I ask you something really simple ? You just did , do you want another one ? It 's just that we never said our names to each other . I 'd rather not use names . Makes things too intimate . At least not until I 'm sure that ... At least not for now ... Back again . Allow me to rephrase my question . Do you have any reason to be afraid of death . Is there anything or anyone ... who would really miss you if you died ? Would mankind be weaker if you did not create anything ? Do you have plans to change politics , technology or art ... in society as we know it ? Like ... Techonology ... I guess not . Oops . I said " I guess " . So this job has a risk of death , yeah ? You are quite astute , huh ? So now it 's an easy answer . I 'm just afraid of dying . What about living forever ? You mess up my mind for sure . I am trying to solve that . You must forgive me , but ... I can 't do this job . I hope someone else shows up . Of course not . If you want it , the job is yours . But I didn 't answer your questions . Of course you did . Can you read ? This is an easy answer . I read the ad . Touché ! I suppose you can also write or draw your name . Be a good girl . Read it and sign it . Is this like a contract ? Can take it home and read it carefully ? You can read carefully right here . I know you 'll sign it . If you don 't , you won 't have money for your rented room . You 're too proud to sleep on the streets . You can 't go back to an old job , because you were totally inapt . So , you 'll read just to understand our agreement and that 's all . This is about science , biology ... Any problem ? It 's just you said you 're a writer and then it got messed up again . Do you agree ? I guess so . 'Guess ' ? Of course you do . I could not expect for a different answer . Pleased to meet you . I 'm Bruna . You can call me Cristi . Feeling at home , Doc ? Music is a natural brain stimulator . You 're the scientist . I would be , but I still don 't have several necessary instruments to ... Is it her ? She speaks , Doctor , and also hears . And answers to the name of ... Cristi . How are you ... Cristi ? Fine . Cristi , this is Dr. Bartholomeu Bava , a renowed neurobiologist . He 's conducting the works and will also guarantee your ... safety . I know this is no 5-star hotel ... There 's ... ah ... There 's your bed . Toilet is over there . There is a closet next to your bed for your things . Didn 't I tell you ? Classified ad . Is this the Melpomene ? She 's quite young . Interested ? Of course not . I 'm just saying she 's young . That 's good . Strong body . I 'm sure she worked in the crops . These chips are larger than I thought . - I mean I guess she 's too young ... - Don 't guess . When was the last time I told you that ? Too long ago . So , let 's not waste another second . Let 's not . - For the operation . Oh , yes . I need a few exams . And the operation ? - I said I need exams before ... - I heard . And the operation ? - Are you in a hurry ? - Yes , aren 't you ? - If I don 't make the tests , I might ... - Excuse me ! Is that the toilet ? Thanks . If I don 't make the tests , things might get delayed or cancelled . It can 't be that complicated . You just have to avoid the mistakes with your wife . Tell me what you are thinking . Give me some writing material . Get your material somewhere else . I am paying you well enough to give me material here . You won 't do anything . You need me . But beware . Now I know how it feels to kill someone . I killed my biggest love and I would not hesitate to kill you ! 15 years later and you haven 't changed . You fight like a child and talk like a cheap soap opera . Tell me . Do soap operas inspire mankind to say all this nonsense , or do people really talk like that and soap operas are accurate ? You 're a person . You should know . What I really want to know is ... What are you going to do after I pay you ? Are you gonna get a girl to marry and then kill her ? None of your business . How rude . You could use the money to get me a drink , right ? You wanna know ? I lied . What ? Your book . I didn 't enjoy it so much . I agree with that reviewer . What 's his name ? Eduardo Graniti . He 's right . You do have problems with your characters development . If you have all this money , I need a few things to complete the procedure . If you 're in a hurry , Get out and bring me what 's on this list . OK , Bartsy . I 'll be right back . Don 't abuse our little guinea-pig . I 'm sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . It 's OK . Cristi ? - Is that your real name ? - Kinda . It 's a nickname . Christiane ? Cristilady . - You 're not from around here ? - Seems everyone notices that . - What ? - Nothing . Do your parents know you 're here ? - I have no parents . - Sure . Now that Bruna isn 't around , can we turn on the radio ? Yes . Certainly . Is that better ? - Much better ... Thanks . - Do you like music ? - A lot . - Do you sing ? - Me ? WHORE ! No . I don 't sing too well . No . I can 't believe that . You look like you can sing wonderfully You look like a star . - Really ? - Really . You 're just saying that , mister . - No , I 'm not and please call me Bart. - I can 't do that . - Try it . Come on and try . Fine . Bart. Thank you . Can I ask you something ? Sure . Is it gonna hurt ? I 'll do anything to keep you safe . I promise you that . What 's your sign ? What ? - Is Bruna your wife ? - No . Sweethearts ? We were once . Not anymore . What happened ? Tomorrow 's a busy day . You better get some sleep . Take one of these before you lie down . What 's it for ? To make you forget you 're here , girl . To make you forget . - Are you afraid ? - A little . Relax . Everything 's gonna be just fine . Bartsy has done this before . I didn 't work out nicely , that 's why he can 't go wrong now . When you wake up you 'll feel way better . If you 're ok , I 'll feel ok . So , relax . If I had any faith , I would pray for a nice outcome . - If it doesn 't ... - It will . But if it doesn 't , can you send the money to that address ? And if it does ? I guess things stay the same . Funny . Your parents ... your foster parents ... will only be proud of you if you 're dead . That 's funny , right ? Bruna ... Leave her alone . Don 't get scared . This is a safety measure in case of involuntary contractions Involuntary contractions . I 'll get you the anesthetic . In a few minutes ... You 'll be asleep . - Can I ask you something ? - Of course . Turn on the radio . Now what ? Now what ? It 's time . For what ? Don 't get naive on me . You know what to do . Maybe it 's not necessary . Maybe another reaction ... I read your report . Does that make you a specialist ? No . But I understand what happened to ' wifey ' . - You won 't ... ! - Now the chip is in her , there might happen a ... a counterflow from the heart into the brain . She might be different . What If she 's not ? I can 't use an exploded girl . I got a redneck as guinea-pig , but it can 't become a habit . - This is totally wron ... - Don 't say ' wrong ' ! Don 't say that . In case you haven 't noticed , everything is wrong . This is a crime . It 's only a crime if anyone else knows , or if you talk . or if she talks . She ? Rip her heart out and then we 'll see if she can talk . You rip out . OK . I 'll do it . If that 's the problem , I 'll do it . Don 't get your hands dirty . I mean ... dirtier . You sound now like a soap opera . Tell me what to do and shut up . You 'll make an incision . Right below the rib . A cut as big as your hand . A few more internal cuts into the chest . Anything less obvious for me to know ? Do whatever you want to . I had never seen one of these close enough . - I expected more . - More ? ! I mean ... I expected something different . What did you expect ? You told me once I had broken your heart . Bruna , this is not the time . Is this what you felt ? You 're ... What did you think I felt ? Stop this . I have to suture ... It came out right ! Is this ' right ? ' Stop pretending you have a conscience ! What do we do with this heart ? Thank you . What for ? For this strange Deja Vu . It 's not funny anymore . I didn 't say it was funny . Breaking a heart is a lot more complicated than splitting up . I didn 't have the stomach for your ... Your Little games ? But you had the stomach to marry that pathetic TV star ? Did you really intend to asphyxiate that guy ? Nothing was proved . I have enough proof . So do I. Do you want to talk , or do you want to see the Melpomene in action ? Is she reacting ? I don 't know . - You don 't know ? Do you know how to know more ? This is your experiment , not mine . No . This is all yours . The chip seems to be magnetically controlling the nerves , but ... Damn ! She has no reflexes . Does it mean it went wrong ? Is she a vegetable ? I can 't go on . Don 't say that . Not now . What am I doing ? A job for me . Now concentrate . Her blood isn 't moving . To get her blood flowing , I must get her this . What 's that ? Nervaglobine . Is a compound to warm up muscles ... and simulates bloodflow so her body can move . You also need this painkiller . Pain ? Cristi , can you speak ? I don 't feel pain . What did you say , girl ? What do you feel ? Nothing . Emptiness . Is that in your plan ? No plans here . The body is reacting to the Melpomene . The chip controls psychotricity functions . Her organs are dead and soon will start to shrink . Am I alive ? You 're ... You 're here . What am I now ? What you signed and agreed to be . Cristi , listen up . You now have the Melpomene . Your body will change . You 'll no longer need food nor sleep . You only need an injection once a day and ... yes ... Recharge the chip every 34 hours or after the dopamine stimulation . Dope ... what ? We 're ready for the tests . Give her paper and a pen . You said you could write . So be a good girl and start writing . What ? A theme for the composition ? Ok . Write what you feel . Write about this emptiness . One more thing . You will feel different , but ... for God 's sake , do what she said . Why ? If you don 't write ... it 's going to get worse . How about it ? Not bad . Not bad for a country girl . Lacks style . A poor vocabulary , of course . The poor girl has no repertoire , but there is attitude . It would be unlikely to get this before the operation . I need to recharge her . - Now ? - Now . How long ? - - This is not an exact scien ... How long ? Two hours , I would guess . You guess ? Two and a half hours . How are you ? It 's strange not to sleep . I haven 't slept for two days . I close my eyes , but ... I still can 't sleep , now my eyes are sore . Use this whenever you feel your eyes are dry . Your sense of smell ? Nothing . I don 't feel anything . Will I ever sleep again ? Do you want me to turn on the radio ? No need . What 's the name of this thing on my head ? Melpomene . 'Ponene ' . Did you make this so people wouldn 't sleep anymore ? No . The chip was supposed only to stimulate creativity . Everything else was ... unexpected . Like the other things . Which things ? You 'll see . Have you done this before ? Yes . Who was it ? My wife . What went wrong ? I didn 't do a necessary procedure . I have to interrupt this cheap soap opera and say that ... this is good . Quite good . Sounds like John Fante , have you read Fante ? No . You had to read Bunker Hill for comparison . What about Salinger ? Your character descriptions are a lot like Salinger 's ... with a little Bukowski . Do you know Bukowski ? No . You need more reading . - If you don 't sleep , you should read . - I should . Satisfied ? It 's amazing . This girl wrote two short stories in a day . And they are quite reasonable . " Reasonable " ? That is subjective . That queer Graniti would drool for a week if he read this nonsense . It 's inspired but it 's too naive . In a hurry ? - Hurry ? The operation ? - Operation ? - On you . What about it ? - Aren 't the results good enough ? Yes . - So ? - In a hurry ? - You were . And you weren 't . Why now ? - I want to end this . In a hurry to leave me again ? - No . I just want to end this . You must be quite busy out there . I told you what to do . Nervaglobine , painkillers and recharges . Are you going out again ? How dreadful . Now she 's in pain ? What if she keeps breaking down ? I need you to tell me what to do . The stomach is shrinking . Why don 't we do like I did with the heart ? What about my heart ? How long will you hide this ? What did you do with my heart ? In this cheap soap Bartsy was telling you , He didn 't say his wife 's head blew up because he couldn 't take her heart . The Melpomene controls nerves and bloodflow . - The heart becomes redundant and ... - You see ? ... Cristi , we saved your life . Don 't I have a heart anymore ? No need for drama . Don 't you see what you are ? You are a New Being . You are the future of mankind . The first one ! This is amazing . You should be proud . Enough , Bruna ! What did you do to it ? Well ... - We had to ... - Get rid of it . And me ? - If you get her a ' Melponepe " ... - " Melpomene " " Pone " , yeah ... Will you do to me the same as you did to my heart ? - No . Then what ? I had not thought of it until this morning . What happened this morning ? I read your writings ... and I saw an alternative . Which alternative ? I don 't need the operation . I mean , we tested it in you and things are fine ... But the risk is still there . I know you well . I can 't leave my life in your hands . - I didn 't mean to kill . It was an .. - Accident ? Bartsy , it 's not an accident if you 're doing something never done before . - Another word and ... - " Another word " ? Bring the commercial Another soap opera line and my heart stops . Calm down , girl . - I have no interest in killing you . - No ? Even if I wanted , I can 't do it now that you have this chip . Is he dead ? That was not my real plan . But now its time to do some ad-libbing . Have you read the Melpomene 's reports ? Of course not . You don 't read anything . This chip is now installed in your Cranial Nerve Zero . Most doctors say it does not exist . Just like you . Don 't try to escape . Write for me . Create something useful . And then burn the body . You can guess where . 1372 nights later ... Welcome to " The Reading Focus Show " . We have here once again literary phenomenon Bruna Bloch . Two years in a row always on the Top Sellers list . Good evening , Bruna . This is quite amazing . Good evening . Looks like it . - No need for false modesty . It 's just my job . If people like it , it 's a real privilege . You released five books after your first hit . One book every three months . Sold out editions and new editions in time records . Quite a feat in the book industry . You even earned praises from feared critic Eduardo Graniti . " B. Bloch achieves the malice that places her among great authors . " " She is still somewhat naive , yet with fine results . " I 'm glad he changed his mind . In fact you changed your style . On my second novel , I tried a more ' naive ' vocabulary . Its simplicity was part of the comprehension . And today you 're releasing ... My latest novel : ' Blood Fable' On bookstores this week . And pre-sale is already sold out . That 's new for me . You should be used to that by now . One never does . We can sense one recurring theme in your works . Whether or not to kill what you love . Yes . - Do you agree with your character ? Do you have to kill what you love if you want to create something ? The reader concludes on his own . I 'm just using my own voice . I imagine you don 't like to talk about this . But newspapers are mentioning both your new book as well as your illness . You 're right . I don 't want to talk about it . Isn 't the illness an inspiration ? Do you intend to use this in your next book ? I don 't know if I will live long enough to write another book . This place is stinking . - Can 't you feel it ? - No . Of course not . I forgot . Did they like ' Blood Fable ' ? Like ? The loved . Didn 't you see ? I 'm glad you 're happy . Such a sad voice ... What is it ? Nothing . I just ... read Dostoevsky last night so ... I never read anything by him . I imagine it is really depressing . I shouldn 't have brought Dostoevsky . He 's not the depressing one . Isn 't he ? Not what I heard . You should read then . No need . I 'll bring Proust to balance it . You already did . I already read it . It 's a ' waste of time ' . 'Every rejected soul ... ' ... met the two travelers and would face them closely , ... " " ... like trying to recognize someone in the darkness under a new moon . " Proust ? It 's obviously Dante . If mice show up , get rid of them . Mice ? Yeah . There are two mice here . What ? Don 't you care ? About what ? Lies . " It 's my own voice " . Oh no . Are you going to rebel again ? What for ? Don 't you really care ? Do you ? - I read your first book again yesterday . - Did you ? You enjoyed writing . I did . I could see you savoring the words . It 's in the past . Where do you think this tumor came from ? Don 't you feel like writing again ? No . I could help you . You 're already helping . No . I mean ... really help . with a Melpomene . What an idea . Didn 't you want that ? - Who 's going to put it ? You ? - Sure . When did you become a neurosurgeon ? I have time here . And neurosurgery just became a hobby ? You said I should read Bart 's reports on the Melpomene . One day . after I read Ulysses , I got bored , ... so I read it . And you practiced on these mice ? Something like that . Ok . Ok . Ok . He didn 't want to keep a secret anymore . The operation is not that hard . The tricky part is to find the Cranial Nerve Zero , but I ... . I guess I did find . So ... Say Hi to Bruna , Bartlsy . Didn 't I tell you this would happen ? Obvious conclusions . Weird , right ? He can 't speak because a certain someone cut his neck . So he developed this sort of telepathy . You 're a monster . You could also be one . Didn 't you want this ? You fifth class whore . Don 't , Bartsy . How long , Bruna ? What ? - How long will you live ? None of your business . - Of course it is . If you die , who 's gonna bring me books ? You should write more . With the Melpomene , your tumor will no longer be a problem . Shut up ! Write more and talk less . Write what ? Your ' swan song ' ? You want to be remembered for something that 's not yours ? - It is mine ! - I beg to differ . Where would you be without me ? In a rotten place like this , but with a beating heart . And no thinking brain ! You 're digressing , Bruna . Do YOU want to be remembered for something you did not do ? Why should I trust you ? Because you have no one else to trust . What do you want me to do ? Say ' yes ' . Operating on your head seems like a good idea to to break the routine . Be a good girl and write something useful . Don 't insist , Bart , I won 't do it . After all this time , you should understand . She 's waking up . Good morning , princess . Let 's see how you are doing ... Can you smell this ? How do you know this thing smells ? Formaldehyde . Do you believe in anything written ? Your attitude is indeed technology-resistant . Did it work ? Any answer should be followed by ' I guess ' , so I ... refrain myself from answering . You can cut me loose . There 's still something . Something ? Don 't you feel with all the time in the world ? Won 't I die anymore ? Initially ... But we must test . Test ? Bart , I can 't do it ! Bart , no ... He wants to see your tumor . I just wanted ... The tumor . The heart is a ' necessary procedure ' . It 's not as dark as I imagined . That was totally gratuitous , girl . I have to confess something . I haven 't used the Melpomene since ' Blood Fable' I don 't need it for writing anymore . But you ... Why did I need this thing in my head to reach this ? Bart , no ! I just came to visit you . The coffee must have a great smell . Stuffy nose ? Caught a cold ? No . Don 't ask for coffee . I 'm only making a cup . I didn 't want to drink it , I just wanted to smell it . Did you see your brother in the big town ? No . I didn 't want to bother . That 's a real son . He studies hard . Now he 's a coroner ! Mother , I 'm not my brother . All I wanted ... Don 't call me mother . - Here . - What 's that ? Cash . From the streets ? - How awful , mother ! Turn on the radio . - What for ? Turn it on and then I 'll go . Try another station . - This is all I listen too . Fine , but tune into FM . Into a real radio with real music . - Blasphemous ! - Mother , don 't push it ! ' ... blackouts programmed by the city 's power company ... " What about it ? It 's gonna play . I 'm sure . And now I bring you ... Her . Cristi Costa , the music phenomenon . She 's wrapped in mystery . Nobody knows where she came from and nobody knows where she 's ... Why did you turn it off ? - Devil 's music doesn 't get in my home . - The money came from this . - Happy ? Go away now . Keep the money . - Take it . It came from fire ... and will go back to hellfire . Go back to hell . Do what you will , mother . You were right . I shouldn 't have come . Danger . Inflammable . May I ? Thank you . Bart are you doing this ? Feeling at home , girl ? - Bruna ? - Who else ? Virginia Woolf ? Hi Bart. So you got into a much more complicated situation than ... the one I offered years ago . You 're alive ? Always the naive girl . Of course I 'm alive . Well , as alive as the both of you . I locked you in . I dug a hole . Why didn 't you think of it when you were there ? What do you want ? I want to get one thing right . You 're an immortal , no metaphores applied . Using the power of Melpomene for ... Pop Music ? At least that 's mine . And a summer hit indeed . Everyone loves Cristi Costa . Not everyone . Welcome to subjectiveness . Why did you come here ? You try to kill me , you get my car my apartment , my ex-boyfriend 's head ... And you think I 'll be ok ? Now Bart ... watch your new ' wifey ' die ! Too bad you don 't have hands to write . Now your head will blow up . I 'm sorry . I didn 't push my Melpomene . I 'm not talking to you . I guessed that ... - Don 't guess . Be a good girl and die . And she lived . Ever after .

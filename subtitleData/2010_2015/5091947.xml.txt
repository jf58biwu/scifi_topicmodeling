 NOLAN : Previously on Defiance ... So , this election of yours is gonna be a close one . I like my chances . Ms Rosewater , Defiance could use a friend like the Earth Republic . With the Earth Republic at our side , this town will only prosper and grow . AMANDA : I 'm not letting you resign . NOLAN : If Datak wins this election , he 's gonna kick open the doors to Colonel Marsh and his E-Rep goons . And a year from now , you won 't even recognise this place . I am going to tell your husband everything about you and me . He has no idea that you 've been chupping his favourite whore . This will end very badly for you . - ( SOBBING ) - Doc ! Doc ! ( IRISA GROANING ) NOLAN : What the hell is that ? Where 's my daughter ? Irisa ! ( GRUNTS ) IRISA : Rynn . NOLAN : Looks like Irisa came this way . The blood drops are getting more frequent . Uh , the blood 's pooled here . She 's lain up . Someone else is coming from this direction and they dragged her off . Mmm-mmm . Yeah . See ? It 's not right . What 's not right ? Well , you know what he did , forcing you to quit . I didn 't quit , Tommy . Amanda fired me and that 's the story you 're gonna stick to , okay ? Yeah . So , are you and Irisa gonna leave town ? We have to find her first . Yeah . ( SNIFFLES ) Come on , son . Let 's go get her . ALAK : Good morning , Defiance ! It 's election day , - and may the best candidate win . - ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) And the polls are open for another six hours , so get to the Darby Building and make your voice heard ! I think we all know who I 'm going to be voting for . A vote for Datak Tarr is a vote for the future of Defiance . So , get out there , my little beat-freaks , and pull the lever for the Man in White . He 'll treat us right ! What does he think he 's doing ? He 's being supportive . It 's excessive . Someone call the Arch and tell my son to shut up ! North end ? Covered . - The towers ? - Covered . Nehi ? A simple question . Is Nehi covered ? It 's a street full of slam-heads and Adreno freaks ... And their votes will be counted ! We can 't afford to lose a single Votan . Were you born stupid ? Does my husband have to do everything around here ? - Go ! - ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Stahma , I could lose this . You need to relax , my love . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( MOANING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) You 've never done that before . I 'm always looking for new ways to please you . MAN : Madame Mayor , right this way . - Hi . Here you go . - WOMAN : Thanks for voting . MAN : Now with your wife ... - Ms Rosewater , quick photo , please ? - Of course . WOMAN : Thank you . That 's great . - Hello , FA-vi Tarr . - Hello . My beautiful wife is here to cast her vote . Isn 't she LI-ro YE-le-ni-lak-sa ? ( STAHMA CHUCKLES ) She 's lovely . I 'd keep an eye on her if I were you . ( PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) There 's only one other person who did what you just did to me , and I pay her by the hour . I know you 've betrayed me . I should open your guts right here in front of these good people . But a vote is a vote . ( CHUCKLES ) - Make sure you check the right name , darling . - ( ALL LAUGH ) ( GASPS ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) MAN : You two , at the door ... ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) You ever hear of knocking ? Hear me , Gyaamaashaa of the Waves . The water in my brother does not flow . Raze the dams and summon the wind . Lively up the blood again . Sukar , wake up . I need you . He squeezed my hand . Involuntary . It means nothing . He is dead inside . Thanks to Nolan . I told you . Nolan didn 't mean for this to happen . I heard things about him out West . Never took you for a gossip , Rynn . Hiya , kiddo . Glad to see you 're okay . Nice handiwork . You the one who patched her up ? Thank you . I did it for Sukar . You don 't deserve my mercy . No argument there . Why 'd you run ? I don 't know . I just knew I had to go . I dreamed I was following someone . Someone who could give me answers . I always assumed you people were after the gulanite mines . The Earth Republic at large , perhaps . And they shall have them thanks to your soon-to-be-mayor . But I 'm after something much bigger . The Kaziri . I 'm not familiar ... ( INHALES ) The Votan ship with the extremely powerful weapon system hidden at the bottom of those mines . You know , the one that your kind has been searching for , for almost 3,000 years . Yes , I have been watching you and , uh , Nicky Riordan and Solomon Birch , waiting patiently for one of you to lead me to it . Just tell me where to find the girl , and the artefact that you discovered inside her . No ? Jonah , do we have any leads ? I have men combing the town . We 'll find her . That would make the doctor expendable . I am willing to make a deal . ( GLASS SHATTERS ) MARSH : Be sure to make it look like an accident . We 're new in town . We don 't want to make a bad impression . There are two artefacts inside of her . So both keys are active and both are inside the Irathient girl . Where is she ? What do you plan to do with her ? I would be more concerned with what we plan to do with you . JONAH : ( CLEARS THROAT ) Doctor , allow me to properly introduce myself . I 'm Special Consultant Jonah Keller , informally known as Black Jonah . ( CLATTERING ) Perhaps you 've heard of me . I am a professional interrogator and I enjoy my work to an arguably indecent degree . Love the hardware . Like I said , I 'm here to help . IRISA : So there 's a crashed ship underneath Defiance ? According to Yewll , there 's a weapon onboard that could kill every human being on the planet , or every Votan , depending on how you use it . That 's what everybody 's after . The cult you rescued me from . They were looking for the Angel of Death who could carry the keys . To trigger the weapon ? It needs two , just like our old nukes . And now they 're both inside me . So , my visions are connected ? Yeah . I should have taken them more seriously sooner . Sorry about that . You know what the cult called me ? The Devouring Mother . What 's inside you doesn 't determine ... - The Destroyer . - You determine who you are . I 'm the Angel of Death . No . You were a little girl in a bad situation . My little girl . KENYA : I don 't believe you . Believe what you want . He threatened to kill me . I can only imagine what he has planned for you . I thought you said that he already knew , and that he didn 't care . When I said that , I was lying . I 'm not lying now . Uh-huh . Well , why don 't I go to Nolan or Amanda ? You 'll start a war that won 't stop . People will die . Is that what you want ? No , you should leave town while you still can . That 's what I 'm doing . You can come with me if you want . And why should I believe you ? You threatened to kill me . ( SIGHS ) You think you understand Castithans , but you don 't . You are not Castithan . You are not subject to our laws . And you don 't deserve to be hurt by them . If you gave a shtako about me , you would have stopped your husband from hurting my sister . I suppose I 'm not as brave as you . - I 'll be at Edmond Field at 1800 hours . - ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) NOLAN : I 'm gonna get you away from here . Find a real doctor and get those things out of your body . And then we 're gonna go back to Plan A , like we started . We 're gonna head south , and we 're gonna put the town of Defiance in our rear-view . ( VEHICLE APPROACHING ) Move . MAN : Move ! Move ! ( MEN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) NOLAN : These guys don 't look or move like E-Rep regulars . They 're mercenaries . I think I recognise the leader , hard case by the name of Black Jonah . Works out of Marin . It 'd take a hell of a big contract to get him all the way out here . ( GRUNTS ) I am looking for Irisa Nolan , a daughter of Irzu . She is wanted for crimes against my people . Bring her to me and nobody gets hurt . - We could take them . - No , no way . Too many . ( EXHALES ) We let this play out . What do you think you guys are doing ? You have no jurisdiction here . You can 't just bust into the camp like that . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) ( GROANS ) MAN : If you 're thinking of something , don 't do it . Come out , come out wherever you are , sweet pea ! ( SIGHS ) All we want is the girl . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( SCREAMS ) ( GROANS ) Stay down . I will run out of bodies long before I run out of bullets ! Don 't ... It 's Tommy ! No more shooting ! MAN : There , on the ridge . I 'm coming down ! While he 's distracted , climb the ridge and get clear . - One rule ... - ( GUN COCKS ) We live or die together . You 're an idiot . I 'm the idiot . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) - Here 's the final tally , Councilwoman . - Thank you . ( WHISPERS ) There is one there . Yeah . Okay , now this one . Yes . Okay . Yes . Fellow citizens , the election results are in . ( OVER RADIO ) All votes have been tallied and verified . It is my duty to announce the name of the next mayor of Defiance . Datak Tarr . ( ALL CHEERING ) Datak Tarr wins the election by a narrow margin . The final count was 2,436 votes for Tarr , 2 , 110 for incumbent , Amanda Rosewater . And 87 votes undecided . ( WOMAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ) The election of Datak Tarr comes after a long and acrimonious campaign , rife with allegations of corruption and mismanagement . It 's official . - Looks like you backed the right horse , sir . - ( SCOFFS ) You know , I miss horses . They had such dignity . Let 's head over to the mines and get this over with . ( MAN TALKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( IRISA GRUNTING ) NOLAN : Hey ! Hey ! What do you want with her ? The girl 's under arrest . What for ? Stealing . Bullshtak ... ( GRUNTS ) We just received confirmation . Regular army 's secured the L-7 mine . They 've set up a perimeter . Sounds like a party . Let 's move . Stay here . Clean up . ( ENGINE STARTS ) - ( GROANING ) - ( GRUNTING ) AMANDA : Good night . MAN : Good night . - I 'm sorry , Amanda . - Thank you . - Hey . - Oh ... - I 'm sorry . - ( CHUCKLES ) Who wants to be mayor anyway ? I mean , all day , everyone I meet is either angry at me or wants something from me . And either way , they 're never satisfied . At least in your line of work , people like you . - And they 're always satisfied . ( LAUGHS ) - Almost always satisfied . - You were a great mayor . - Mm . No , not great . But I was pretty damn good . A really good sister . You 've sacrificed a lot for me . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . I 'm fine . I just wanted to say that if I ... If I didn 't say thank you enough , it was because I was so jealous of you . - Oh , Kenya . No , look , I lost an election . - Shh . You don 't have to talk me off a ledge . I 'm fine . I 'll be fine . ( LAUGHS ) I 'll be fine . ( SIGHS AND CHUCKLES ) ( INHALES ) I 'll be fine . ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) I did not think you would come . I 'm surprised myself . I have a roller on the other side of the hill . I 've arranged to rendezvous with a land coach headed to Chicago . I 'm sorry I made you walk so far in the cold . Here , drink something . Stahma ... What 's in the flask ? Drugs ? Poison ? ( BREATH TREMBLES ) - Nothing of the kind . - So drink it . I 'm not thirsty ... Drink it ! All of it , now ! Yeah , I thought so . Move . Now . Let 's find that roller of yours . It was penance . I had to show my husband I was serious about atonement . KENYA : I know a nice Stratocarrier in the middle of nowhere . And if your husband wants to see you alive again , he 'll have to meet my demands . Which are ? Get out of Defiance for good . He 'll never agree to that . Then you 're dead . Did you ever care for me at all ? ( SIGHS ) What does that matter ? Was I always just a client to you ? Nothing more ? Just a client . It was a new experience for me , opening myself up to a relationship outside my liro , outside my family . It was exhilarating . ( GASPS ) The poison was on the flask . I 've got you . It 's all right . ( WHISPERING ) Go to sleep . I 'll take care of you . ( SINGING IN CASTI ) Pretty little human . MARSH : I want those keys removed from the girl and implanted in one of our soldiers . - That may be difficult . - Why ? You said both keys were inside her . We can 't find them . What ? They seem to have been completely absorbed into her cells . JONAH : If you 're playing us , I will scalp that golf ball head of yours and wear it for a hat . What 's a golf ball ? She 's telling the truth . Let 's run the high-voltage charge . - Try and draw them back together . - No . It 'll burn her to a crisp . It 's survivable . So is castration . I 'm sure you 'll do it in the most tender way possible , Doctor . Let 's go . ( DOG BARKING ) ( DOOR OPENS AND CREAKS ) Congratulations . You have earned this . You 've managed to suck this victory dry of any joy I might have experienced . Oh , the mines . Yes , well , I 'm sorry about moving up the timetable like that . You blockaded the mines during my victory party . I had to hear about it from a newspaper reporter . I had no idea what she was talking about and looked like a fool . Uh-huh . Well , the Earth Republic will find a way to make it up to you . What was the rush ? Why didn 't you wait for me ? This was never about the gulanite , was it ? Smart man . What then ? What 's down there ? Sorry . Need-to-know . Oh , I think you need me to know . Now , right this minute . I 've worked hard to take control of this town , to win respect . And in one reckless act , you 've trivialized me . Come morning , every soul in this town will be asking themselves who 's running the place , Datak Tarr or the Earth Republic ? Yes , well , as I say , you will be compensated . Yes . Castithans love money . Can 't get enough of it . Amusing . Now , I strongly suggest you dig deep and afford me some courtesy ! You are one uppity little haint . You know , after all of this is over , you 're going right back to being a nobody . ( MUFFLED NOISES ) ( MUFFLED YELL ) Whatever you did to me in my office , do it again . JONAH : What are you doing ? Checking her condition . She needs water . Getting soft in your old age , Doc . Word is you used to dissect humans while they were alive and kicking . Yeah , yeah , yeah , I was a monster . I regret my past . And I 'm trying to do better . You should be taking notes . ( MUFFLED GRUNTING ) MAN 1 : You do the incision ? MAN 2 : Right . Lock the doors . I 've done as you asked . DATAK : Thank you , Stahma . You 're a good wife . They 're looking for the Colonel downstairs . They won 't find him downstairs . He 's right there . ( BREATH TREMBLES ) MAN : Colonel Marsh ? Sir ? The Earth Republic will come for us . Masters of our fate no longer . I miss home . I know . MAN : Pick that up . Come on ... So do I. - MAN : Sir ? Colonel Marsh ? - ( DOOR OPENS ) ( SOBBING ) ( ELECTRICITY WHIRRING ) Full power . ( CLANKING ) Hey . ( SHUSHES ) What 's going on ? Our new mayor didn 't waste any time . He seized the mines and turned them over to the Earth Republic . The bastards rolled in here waving guns and paperwork . When my boys get the word out , we 're gonna drive these punks out of Defiance . No . - No time for that . - ( GROANS ) They 've got Irisa . You 're determined to get me shot , ain 't ya ? Yeah . It 's a lifelong ambition of mine . - ( ELECTRICITY WHIRS ) - ( IRISA SCREAMS ) - All right . - Let 's go ! ( IRISA SCREAMING ) MAN 1 : Get out there ! Get out there ! Who 's shooting ? MAN 2 : Let 's go ! Move . - MAN 3 : Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) Good girl . ( GROANS ) ( MEN SCREAMING ) ( MAN SCREAMING ) ( GUNFIRE OUTSIDE ) ( WHISPERING ) Hey . Hey , kiddo . It 's all right . It 's all right . I 'm here . All right . We 're gonna get you out of here . That 's the way . That 's my girl . It came out and attacked everyone . It 's back inside me . Okay , all right . Just look at me , okay ? Keep your eyes on me . I 'll get you out of these , and get you home . MAN : Flank ' em ! NOLAN : That 's it . That 's it . - ( GUNSHOTS FIRING ) - ( GROANS ) Nolan , hurry up ! ( GROANS ) ( RELOADING GUN ) Looks like you caught a couple . - I 'll live . Get Irisa and get outta here ! - TOMMY : I 'll cover you . ( RAFE GROANS ) You up to this ? Don 't worry about me . ( COCKS GUN ) Let 's go . NOLAN : Okay , let 's find a roller so we can get Rafe outta here . MAN : Hold up ! ( GRUNTS ) Irisa ! NOLAN : Oh ! ( GROANS ) Nolan ... ( COUGHS ) - You 're okay ... It 's okay ... - ( COUGHING ) Run . Run . - No . Shut up . - Yes . - We have one rule , we live or die together . - ( PANTING ) It 's a stupid rule . Yeah ? - I 'm sorry . - No , Nolan . Nolan ! No . No ! ( GRUNTING ) Nolan ! Nolan , get up ! Nolan ! Get up , Nolan ! - Run ... Run ... - Nolan , come on . We have a rule , Nolan . Nolan . ( SOBBING ) Please ... Get up ... I love you . ( SOBBING ) IRISA : Sukar ? Little Wolf . Nolan is dead . Of course . It is impossible to escape your destiny . You are the Devouring Mother . Irzu could not let Nolan take you from this place . You 're wrong . Irzu didn 't kill Nolan . Humans did . Nolan no longer walks your path . Your fate lies below . There is a great evil in that mine . You must face it and make your choice . What if my destiny is to set it free ? ( SNIFFLING ) IRISA : Who are you ? You can call me Irzu . IRISA : Irzu ? You 're not real . I 'm as real as you are . I don 't believe in you . You 're fooling yourself . You 've come this far . You want what I offer . No , I don 't . I didn 't want to be here . - Nolan ... We were ... - Do you want to bring him back ? It 's okay . Admit what 's in your heart . I can 't lose him . - What will it cost me ? - Everything . Devouring Mother , Destroyer you must become . How can I become ? What do I need to do ? You must become my weapon . Each stone is a step - to Irzu 's path . - To Irzu 's path . I will show you the first step , but you must take the next . Are you ready ? Little Wolf . Become . ( GASPS ) ( METALLIC SOUND ) ( CLICKS ) ( LOUD ROAR ) ( DISTANT MURMURING ) ( GASPS ) Nolan . ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Irisa ? What did you do ? ( GROANING ) Irisa ! MAN OVER PA : Unit C , proceed down main street ! Attention all citizens of Defiance , this is the Earth Republic . We have assumed control of the town .

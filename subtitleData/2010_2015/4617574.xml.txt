 Year 2047 IMDO , the International Mars Development Organization , today celebrates the completion of its first Mars colony . Construction of the " Esperanza " base began in 2030 . In just a short while , it will begin accepting the proposed 500,000 immigrants from Earth . All candidates must pass the IMDO 's strict screening process . Hiroshi ... What are your plans ? My plans ? Nothing special . The Earth will be uninhabitable in ten years anyway . Only a handful of the " chosen " get to go to Mars . You let a failed exam really get to you . That 's kind of pathetic . Slouching around at home won 't make things better . Hiroshi , you can 't go to Mars if you don 't study . Don 't be a smart-ass just because you get good grades . Koyomi , do you want to live on Mars ? Yep . In the future , all three of us will live there . Sure , you 'll study hard and build us a big house . I 'm counting on you . Listen to you ... It looks kind of cushy . Maybe I 'll join the military , like you . A bum like you in the military ? Don 't talk nonsense . Don 't talk nonsense . Get lost . Akishima here . Understood . I 'll be there in twenty minutes . It 's an emergency . I 've got to leave . For work ? What about the movie you promised ? I 'm sorry . We 'll go next week . What 's up with her ? Sulking about the movie . Look after her while I 'm gone . Where did I put it ? Where 's Dad ? He left already . I was going to give him this . Fly Safely Give it to him when he gets back . Honestly , I always thought things would work out . That peace would last forever . But that was a fantasy . Dad left that day and never came back . In September , 2047 A.D. , an unknown asteroid appeared in Earth 's orbit . It was named " Februus . " It was a base for some kind of intelligent life , which the military dubbed " FOS . " FOS launched an attack on mankind . An international military response had absolutely no effect on them . FOS forces deployed " thermo-reactive " weapons to melt the polar icecaps . Sea water levels rose , and most major cities were quickly engulfed . Any remaining cities were burned to the ground . In just six days , most of mankind was dead . In December , after that cascade of chaos , a supra-national defense organization was formed , the " Provisional Government of Integrated Planetary Nations . " All remaining military strength was formed into the PDFA , " Planetary Defense Forces Alliance . " Six years after the FOS invasion — Year 2053 Japan Area United , Fuji Base I joined the struggle ... against the countless , black hordes . Hey , Akishima , giving up ? Wait a sec . I 'm not done yet . Lt. Akishima , there 's no way you 'll get out of that . You owe me two potato croquettes . Not again . Twenty-four losses in a row . Sagawa , you 're no better . Want to know a great rumor I just heard ? More gossip . Someone pulling your leg again ? Just listen , for Chrissakes ! Somewhere in this base ... is hidden an ultimate , top-secret weapon . Its code name is " Kairos . " It 's the decisive weapon . Is it nuclear ? We 've already seen that nukes do nothing against FOS , right ? What then ? Something far more powerful . Maybe ... Maybe ? Seems like you 're having fun . Major Yoshizawa , when did you get back ? About twenty minutes ago . Good news for you layabouts , twiddling your thumbs . The Eastern Russian Area Force 's " Tunguska " anti-FOS offensive has ended in failure . Their army group 's been annihilated . Japan Area United is the only one left in the Far East theater . Orders for a twelfth anti-FOS offensive using our Prototype GL Force have arrived from Superintendent General Yoshizawa 's HQ . You 'll be briefed at 0900 tomorrow . All pilots to standby . Headed for actual combat . But ... it 's so sudden . Keep your shirt on . For Chrissakes ... We 're supposed to be ready for this . Lt. Akishima ... about this enemy we 're facing , FOS ... What do you think it really is ? " Extraterrestrial Hostile Intelligent Organisms " by military definition . Some say there 's a human cause behind it . Doubting the authorities ? Honestly , I don 't know what to believe . Don 't think too much . For me , FOS is about avenging my father . No matter what it is ... I just want to kill . Actually , my brother was a soldier . He was involved in the design of the Geometric Limbs . So you volunteered to be a pilot ? He was my brother , but I hardly knew him . I have no memory of him . But I wanted to get to know him better , so I enlisted as a GL pilot . Is that it ? Yes , but ... do I need a grand cause like revenge ? Not really , but ... I worry whether I can fight or not . I 'm not driven by hatred for them . I was sad when my brother died , but ... Jeez , where 's the funeral , guys ? Captain Tazaki , how 'd you get here ? Drinking on standby-to-fly ? Booze is banned , you know ? Loosen up . Want some ? It 's home-brewed hooch . As if I 'd try anything that suspect . Damn ... Made with love for this special day . Let 's face it , we 're — I won 't report the booze , if you grant me two hours leave . Where to , at a time like this ? It 's me . It 's been ages . I need to talk . At 2000 ... I mean , 8 PM , are you free ? Make an excuse to leave your dorm . Before the FOS attack , this was a lively part of town . It 's beyond recognition now . A hellish world . The handful of survivors , lacking military connections , get no help . They face either starvation or a subsistence life of banditry . We 're lucky to have military protection . Although some say we 're just cannon fodder . It 's been two years . Are you well ? How 's school ? Okay , I guess . What 's up ? There 's a big offensive tomorrow . For security reasons , there 'll be no evacuation notice . Civilians may get caught in the cross-fire . Wait a minute . Therefore , you must go to Mars . To Mars ? Get the Esperanza II shuttle tomorrow . I 'll send a buddy to meet you at 9 AM . Get ready to evacuate . Don 't forget your passport , credit card , and military-issued ID . How about you ? You 're going on your own . I don 't want to go to Mars alone . You have to get out of here ! Military family members get priority . Why don 't you leave , too ? You said it 's dangerous . Because I 'm a soldier . A soldier ? So was Dad , and that 's why he died . You 'll die , too . I 'll avenge Dad . That 's a lie . You only joined up to get his approval , right ? But it 's all too late now . You 're a fool ! Focus on your own survival . Me and Dad are none of your business ! We shut down the Diffuser . What the hell do you mean ? Your opinion is not required . As you 're all aware , the Diffuser is a plasma defense screen that protects the world and prevents FOS from entering our atmosphere . Of course ! So why shut it down ? Three years ago , HQ had the Research Division fast-track adapting the Diffuser into terraforming technology . However ... they only did a makeshift job . You know the source of the Diffuser 's massive energy needs ? Nope . Right here ! In the heart of the Fuji Base . Inside this base is the world 's most powerful generator . I 've always suggested we use it , not for passive defense , but to attack the enemy on Februus . Then last month we completed work on a Converged Energy Assault Canon , the D-Cannon . Is that the one ? I guess so . Civilian Intelligence has just announced the receipt of information about a large-scale military offensive . Neither the PDFA nor the government has released any official statement . It is assumed the secrecy is to avoid civil unrest . Between the shield shutdown and the cannon firing , there 's a slight time lag . The enemy will try to exploit this . They 're sure to launch a direct assault . The D-Cannon needs fourteen minutes and forty seconds . Your mission is to defend the base at all costs . This is the strategy for today 's final anti-FOS offensive . Its code name is " Plan-Zet . " " Plan-Zet " ? Analysis of our previous offensives shows that our enemy possesses adaptive intelligence . In other words , they 're " smart . " So any specialist weapon systems or strategies used previously will be ineffective . Hence , the development of the armored mobile attack vehicles , which we call the Geometric Limbs . These are the weapons you will pilot . In other words , while you get your D-Cannon thing ready to fire , we just buy time , right ? That 's correct . The D-Cannon 's so fragile that it can only be fired once . This will be mankind 's last assault against FOS . Destroying their base will finish the war . However , if we fail , human life will be over . The end of mankind ... Training you three to this level cost the same as building an entire starship . Prove to us that the two years was worth it . Here , here , here , here . Here , here , here ... Far enough ! That woman pisses me off . That hit the spot . Superintendent General Yoshizawa 's daughter became a major in the Combined Fleet . The military elite family connection , huh ? Jealous or something ? N-No way ! High rank or title mean nothing . I know what you mean , but the higher-ups always have the best chances of survival . Isn 't your sister called Koyomi ? She just got into the Military Academy , right ? She 's got an elite future ahead , too . Maybe she 'll turn out like our beloved Major ? Quit it , will you ? For her to have a chance in life , putting her in a military facility was my only option . I lost my wife , daughter , and parents . Take good care of your sister . It 's an order . Understood ? Yes , I intend to do so . Anything wrong ? Your sister 's not here . Where 's she gone ? Did you look for her ? ! What the hell is she thinking ? Commence energy diversion from Diffuser to D-Cannon . All GL pilots , stand by for take-off . We have visitors . All Geometric Limbs , take-off . Let ' em taste our hospitality ! Koyomi ... Aiming the big gun at our base , huh ? Ignore the small fry . Get the mother ship ! A-Affirmative ! I 'll keep the fighters busy . Hit the carrier . Good , go ! Piece of cake ! The simulator was way harder . Damn . Distance , 14,200 . Wind direction , 86 degrees . Speed , 31 knots . Why don 't you shoot ? ! The wind 's too strong ! Shoot , damn it ! They 're acting as shields ! Come on , keep shooting ! Yes , sir ! Out of ammo . No backup mags , Captain ! Damn , I 'm out , too ! That was close . The GLs don 't stand a chance in close-range combat . Not now ! Behind you ! Sagawa ! Brother ... I 'm sorry . Sagawa ! Kaori ! You bastards ! Wait , you idiot ! They killed my father , too ! You forgetting my order ? What are you doing ? I can 't let you die ! Captain Tazaki ! Take good care of your sister . Captain ! Goddamn it . Why ? No enemy detected within 100 kilometers of base . All wings return to base . Capt. Tazaki and Lt. Sagawa are ... I know . It 's a small price to pay . A small price ? My father killed a space monster twenty-eight years ago , and was worshiped as a savior . He then rose to the top of the military . As a daughter of that kind of man , no matter what I do or where I go , people assume I 'm riding his coattails . The success of this operation ... will secure my reputation . I 'll show those useless bastards on Mars ! How come ? Why ? How am I different from my father ? Is this the limit of my ability ? What 's a child doing here ? My brother ... Where 's Lieutenant Akishima ? No idea . Koyomi ! Hiroshi ! You fool , why are you here ? What 's going on ? Pull the trigger , Akishima . Plan-Zet has failed . It 's the end of everything . If you won 't shoot ... Why did you do that ? What 's the point of dying ? Taking responsibility for your troops ? Responsibility ? Don 't make me laugh ! You wouldn 't understand ... what this war really means to me . Because I failed to destroy the FOS , I have no more reason to live . What nonsense ! Does life mean nothing to you ? Sagawa and Captain Tazaki died ! But you 're still here and must protect this base . I wish I could praise their honorable deaths , but sadly , they died in vain . The enemy will soon take over Earth . What 's that ? The time remaining before the base self-destructs . There 's no way to stop the sequence . Why are you doing this ? This is ... my last mission . Koyomi . The base will explode in two minutes and fifty seconds . Can we get out ? We have less than three minutes . There 's an underground shelter . It 's our only hope . Nothing happened . What ? What 's that ? I am Superintendent General Yoshizawa . The fact that this image is being played ... means the strategic situation is lost . But do not despair yet . Where you stand now isn 't a shelter . It 's the control room of Kairos , our last resort . Kairos ? We 're inside it ? Kairos is a double-edged sword . It has the power to destroy our enemies , but it is also capable of destroying us . Thus , I wanted this only for defense , and never as a weapon of attack . That is the nature of the Diffuser . But now it must be too late for that . I am ordering you to deploy Kairos . No , this is not an order . I entrust you with the last hope of mankind . The Kairos System follows the operator 's thoughts . The power of a strong will can vanquish our enemy . I pray that you will bring about a second chance for humanity . Hey ! Koyomi . Head out that way . Wait a minute . What about you ? Brother ? I have to go . Why ? We 've been lucky to survive . Why do you have to take more risks ? You still want to avenge Dad ? It 's not that . Dad 's not coming back . But that doesn 't mean I can 't do anything . I don 't get it . If we do nothing , the Earth will be destroyed . All our memories and dreams , our everyday lives ... gone . As if they 'd never existed . Aren 't I right ? But you don 't have to be the one to do it . Somebody else will . It doesn 't have to be you . Isn 't that right ? Koyomi ... I am that " somebody . " There are times others can do it ... but there are also times no one else can . Dad and my colleagues ... gave me something precious . And now , I 'm giving it back . I 'm off . I 'm coming , too . I 'll come with you . Koyomi . Slap me if you like , but I 'm not moving from here . Why ? Because I believe in you . And ... because we 're family . What is it ? An enemy attack . Once we 're done , we 're going home . And I 'll take you to a movie . It 's my treat . Don 't you dare forget . Kairos , take off . Target the asteroid , Februus . Go , Kairos . Kairos beam . Deploy Diffuser ! We can 't get close enough . What can we do ? Maybe it 'll dismantle itself entirely . We can 't wait for that to happen ! We 've lost the Diffuser ! Great , it 's coming towards us . My beam 's out . Brother , look down ! Damn . Is it trying to smash us into the Earth ? The impact of something this big will destroy the entire world . It 's getting hot . Is it trying to bake us ? Koyomi ! Hold on . Brother ... Dad 's safety charm ... Dad ... help us , please . I beg you ! Is this the end ? Is it no use ? Is all we 've done for nothing ? Why ? Dad ... What should I do ? Dad ? Help me ! Don 't be so spoiled . How dare you ? It 's your world . It 's up to you to defend it ! If not now , when ? If you 've got life in you , fight ! Hiroshi ! Koyomi ... Hold on ... Thank you . Koyomi ... Thank the Lord . You 're awake . I 've been out about three days ? Maybe thirty minutes . Major ... Why ? Must there be a reason ? Maybe it 's not for you . It 's hot . Remember what you said ? That you 'd take me to a movie . Yeah . Not that there are any playing . I know that , silly . But one day there will be . Without a doubt . The letter arrived From an unknown land Long-forgotten The reply was a nuisance I once longed to be found Counting the days " I got your message " " Just as you hoped " " You 'll be a fish one day " It was just a teacher 's spur of the moment thing Write down anything on a piece of paper Put it in a bottle and float it away The wild dreams of privileged children Endless months and days rocked by the waves Tumbling through crests and troughs A little mischief coming over the horizon A token arriving in a far-off land Keeping a hold of that box of glass wishes Flashing blue shadows on the bottom of the sea Swiftly swimming , the surf in my ears Forgetting that I was once human Now a deep-sea fish

 Hands up , don 't move ! Don 't move or I 'll blow your head off . Who else is here ? Who owns that car outside ? I do . But it 's really more like a lease ... Toss the keys over here . - Okay , okay . - Come on ! Empty the cash register . - Start filling this bag . Cigarettes , pack - - Excuse me . I also have this gun , you 'll probably be needing that . - Put it down ! Right now ! - Put it down ! Put it down ! Okay , don 't want any trouble . Toss the piece over here then . I prefer not to throw it and risk the gun accidently going off ... Maybe I could slide it over ? Yes , slide it over to my feet , don 't try anything funny . Okay . I 'm just gonna move over to this aisle , and I slide it over to you . Okay . Sorry for the mess . I couldn 't decide . Keep the change . Wait ! What should I tell the police ? Tell the those Tae-Bo tapes really paid off .

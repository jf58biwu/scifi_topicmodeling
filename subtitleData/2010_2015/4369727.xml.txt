 You have to come back . Previously on Fringe : Because you belong with me . Make the switch . Welcome back . Please let me out of here . Please let me out of here ! Our agent Dunham , has she made contact ? She 's on the Other Side . Walter says this tech isn 't from here . They can have an army . Look like anyone they want them to . The shapeshifter 's blood is mercury . I have everything for your new identity . Careful . Their side may be alluring , but they started the war . I don 't care how long you 've been here . This is my operation . You work for me . So , what else did you come up with ? And you can 't say " pirate " again . Definitely a banker . - Heh , banker ? - Mm-hm . - Persian Kid Rock ? - Yeah . His long hair is just his link to his individuality . I think they work together . Well , she 's wearing her sexiest little black dress so somewhere deep inside she was hoping this was something else . Not work . But she was wrong . Yes , she was . That , however , is truly impressive . Yeah . He 's a little short for her . I 'll grant you that . - Not when you stand him on his money . - Hmm , careful , your con man 's showing . I think I just understand transactional needs . Each party has something the other party wants . She gets security , he gets her . We all draw our moral lines in the sand . And unless you can put yourself in another man 's shoes I don 't think you can really judge their situations . But look at the body language . - They haven 't slept together yet . - No ? You can tell when a relationship 's about to take that step . I had a really nice time tonight . Me too . But , unfortunately , if I don 't get home Walter 's gonna wonder where I am . And then he 'll probably start calling the emergency rooms . Shall we ? Thanks . Have a good night . Um give me a moment ? - Of course . I 'll be outside . Hi , Senator Van Horn . Hi , girls . I 've been looking for some lemonade all day . - Know where I can find some ? - We 're selling lemonade . You are ? Well , perfect . Mrs. Van Horn has me running all over town . I am parched . - Oh , that looks delicious . How much ? - One dollar . - One dollar ? - We made it ourselves . Well , I don 't know . You know , this just might be the best lemonade I have ever had . I 'll see you , okay ? - Bye . - Bye . Wait . You forgot your change . Fifty-eight . Victim is unresponsive . Possible head injury . I don 't feel a pulse . Charge defib ? - Not yet . - But he has no pulse . Then why 's he still breathing ? - Patricia . - Oh , Phillip . I heard on the news . I got here as fast as I could . - How is he ? - I don 't know . They won 't tell me anything . I want information on James Van Horn . - Prep and alert the OR . - OR 's standing by . Get me a CBC and tox screen . What 's his BP ? Not getting anything . No pressure . Start CPR . What the hell 's going on with this guy ? Stand aside , please . You can 't be in here . Stay here . Stop right there ! Freeze ! FBI . Drop your weapon . You . Come here . - I will kill her . - Drop your weapon . Do it . No ! Can 't expect me to believe you 're okay with this . William 's wish was that your father take over this company . My personal feelings are not at issue . With a basement lab in Harvard Walter was able to open a wormhole that shredded the laws of science . I can 't wait to see what he 's doing with a billion-dollar corporation . Your father made some regrettable choices in the past . But his brilliance is undeniable . It was that intellect that William Bell believed in . And frankly , so do I. It 's not his intellect I 'm concerned about . So beautiful . It is absolutely breathtaking . Somewhere between pudding and foie gras . Why do I bring this up ? You with the red hair . - It 's black . - I see red . Answer the question . I 'm not sure why we 're talking about brain physiology . Dear God , how can you be so limited ? When William Bell created this company he knew one thing to be true . The brain and the mind are capable of so much . Don 't you see that the brain is consciousness . Hmm ? Hmm ? The mind is God ! There are no limits except for those that we impose on ourselves . Open your eyes . Open . Open . Inspiration is everywhere . Do you know how lucky you are to play in this sandbox ? My heart is racing . Come on . Is anyone else hot in here ? - Uh , sorry to interrupt . - Oh , you 're just in time for the good bit . Put your pants back on . We got a case . We have to go . Of course . I 'll just get my things . He 's a bit unorthodox . Also tripping his brains out right now . - You know that , right ? - Hmm . Van Horn was admitted at 1400 hours . Newton came in 15 minutes later and went on a shooting spree . Look at that . It 's like he 's got no fear . Clearly Van Horn was an operative of Newton 's . We assume Newton knew Van Horn 's identity as a shapeshifter would be revealed . So Newton came here to retrieve him . And when he couldn 't , he shut him up . Hmm . In the right light , your hair looks like strands of lemon diamonds . - He self medicated this morning . - Don 't worry . I do some of my finest work self medicated . Good . Because not only was James Van Horn a sitting senator with top-level clearance he was a good man . I want to know how long ago he was replaced and for what purpose . Want a full accounting of every committee , every classified briefing he had . I 'll make sure his office is locked down . Broyles , if they can get to a sitting senator the government could be compromised . I know . I 'm gonna call the CDC and arrange blood tests for everyone . - Dr. Bishop . - Mm-hm . Examine the body , see what you can find . Of course . I think I 'll go examine the body and see what I can find . - So is it a machine ? - No . Where can I purchase some candy buttons ? Those little candies attached to rolls of paper . - Do they still make those ? - I wouldn 't know . I try not to eat sugar . So if it 's not a machine , it 's human ? Nerve hook . To answer your question , it is neither , and both . Part machine , part organic . A shapeshifter . Such an inspired creation . Frankly I 'm a little envious that Belly thought of it before I did . How 's it going in here ? You 'll be happy to know that having something to focus on is calming the vividness of my hallucinations . I 'll probably be able to take it from here . - Thank you . - Heh . - So , Walter ... - Shh . I 'm glad she 's gone . Very negative energy . It seems pretty specific , don 't you think , Walter ? One shot , right through the eye ? That 's a good question . Assuming that Newton shot the shapeshifter to incapacitate him perhaps this is the location of some sort of power source . So assuming that you 're right , do you think we could fix it ? Fix him ? We could try . - Yes ? - What were you thinking ? Van Horn was in a car accident . He was a liability . I had to act . - What did he know ? - He was a senior operative . - He knew everything . - About me ? Who do you think provided the information on Olivia Dunham and the team ? Don 't worry . He 's been disabled . Or as you people call it , he 's dead . He can 't talk and data recovery 's impossible . Your cover 's safe . For now . What do you mean , my cover 's safe for now ? I don 't know what your mission is , Olivia and you 've made it very clear that it 's none of my concern . Whatever it is , I imagine it requires you to gain Peter Bishop 's complete trust . What makes you think that I don 't already ? Oh , maybe it 's because I 'm looking in from the outside but I 'm willing to wager that somewhere , deep inside his brain Peter Bishop senses that something 's not quite right with you . That something has changed . That you 're not his Olivia . You need to remember who you 're talking to . You 're in over your head . You 're not fully committed to this task , and because of that , you will fail . Did you know in the 19th century hat makers used mercury to flatten the fur on hat brims ? Sadly , the mercury caused significant brain damage . Hence , where Lewis Carroll got the term " Mad Hatter . " Thank you , Walter . That 'll be very helpful next time I 'm on Jeopardy . I can 't animate this shapeshifter . Not here . Perhaps if we moved the body back to my lab . Sure . - I 'll have body transferred to Harvard . - No . My other lab . The equipment of Massive Dynamic is state of the art . Okay . I 'll call Nina right now . Uh-oh . I think I might be peaking again , Peter . Perhaps chamomile tea would help . Whoa , stop , stop . What did you just do , Walter ? I must have triggered something . - So how 's it going in here ? - Oh , Agent Dunham . Good news . It seems this tin can is still kicking . Agent Astrid Farnsworth . I 'm here to see Dr. Bishop . I 've got an Astro Farnsworth . That 's me . Mm-hm . You know , the old me would have been really disgusted by that . Ah , finally . Did you get everything on the list ? - I don 't even want to know . - Which one are you referring to ? Both . Uh , did you get the candy buttons ? - Yeah . Do you think ... ? - They 're for me . Okay . Now , do you mind telling me what all this stuff is for ? We 're making a treasure map . Somewhere inside this creature is a data storage unit and now that 's he 's alive , I 'm going to find it . Using those items as visual stimuli we are going to map its neural pathways what we would think of as its brain . - And what are we hoping to find ? - Its memories , Astrid . Everything it knows . Who it was working for . If there are others . - You look shocked . - You just called me Astrid . You never get my name right . Must be the LSD . These are Senator Van Horn 's Homeland Security briefings going back three years . - Great . Thank you . You know , I can handle this if you wanna go check on Walter . Astrid must be there by now . If they 've learned anything , I 'm sure they 'll call . The senator made requests for classified intelligence 29 times last month . There 's nothing here . If he 's like the other shapeshifters , he 's careful . He 's not gonna leave anything here that would tell us he wasn 't the senator . Uh , except for one thing . He didn 't know that today was the day he was gonna die . Unless he had someone come and clean up there 's gotta be something . - It 's Rachel . I should take this . - Tell her I said hi . Hmm . Hey , Rach . What 's up ? It 's customary to leave one message and the caller will get back to you . Not 30 . He 's alive . Van Horn is alive . - That 's impossible . - You underestimated them . He 's on the 23rd floor of Massive Dynamic . Dr. Bishop 's working on him now . - I 'll take care of it . - You 'd better . Hey , I think I found something . What is it ? It 's you . You and me . And Walter . All of us . Every case we ever worked on . He knew everything . Pretend the train 's going into the station ? I 'm 7 and a half , Mom . You forget you 're dealing with a very mature young man here . Ah , I 'll tell them we don 't want any . Come on . Asparagus , it 's great . It 'll make your pee smell funny . Ha , ha , real funny . Hello , Ray . I have an assignment for you . The body 's in a lab on the 23rd floor . You expect me to break into Massive Dynamic ? Oh , you don 't have to . Just shift into a new body . A scientist , or someone with clearance . Shouldn 't be a problem . Is it ? No , I 'm just surprised . I haven 't seen you in five years . Well , you know , that 's the way it works . After this mission , you 'll take a new identity . And Ray . No traces left behind . Nothing that can expose us . - Understood ? - I 'll contact you when it 's done . Good . I 've got agents throughout the building and an N.Y.P.D. detail has set up a perimeter . What makes you think that Newton would try to recover the shapeshifter ? - I 'd rather be wrong than sorry . - Sure . - I heard you were back ... - Oh , hold on here , Walter . According to files in Van Horn 's office , he 's been collecting intel on us . Suggests when he was shifted . Besides Newton , anything about other shapeshifters ? Anything that would tell us who they 're working with ? - No . - So did you find anything in D. C ? We ran tests on every person on the Hill . Everyone checks out . What about the DOD and FBI ? Shapeshifters could have infiltrated their ranks too . We 're testing everyone with a Level Four classification or above . No . Go wider . Van Horn can 't be the only mole . - There 's no way ... - Maybe we should just ask him . - What ? - That 's what I 've been trying to say . If you want to know who the shapeshifter 's been working with I think we should just ask him . Is it possible that there 's recoverable data in Van Horn ? Walter thinks so . We 've been trying techniques to locate it . At first , we did not have very much luck . With everyday objects , the shapeshifter had a minimal reaction . But then we tried something more personal . Watch the monitors closely . Here 's what happens when I show it a toy car . No neural activity . But when I show a photograph of the senator 's wife ... So those areas are where the data is ? - Uh , no , we haven 't found any data storage . - Not yet we haven 't . But I believe we can continue to revive the neural pathways by playing upon this emotional tie . - I 'm not following . It 's a machine . - Yes . And to succeed in its mission , it needed to play the role of a spouse . And pretending to have an emotional connection caused a real one to form . The ability to process complex emotions is built into the machine 's operating system . We just needed a stronger trigger to find the data . We need to use Van Horn 's wife . Oh , I don 't think we can ask that of a civilian , Walter . I mean , not to mention the security clearance it would require . - It 's the only way . - Broyles , I know she 's a friend of yours but if we get that data ... - I don 't think it 's a good idea . Imagine the panic if she talks . I 've known Patricia for most of my adult life . Her character is beyond question . If she 's willing to help us , I 'm willing to trust her . Hey , buddy . What are you still doing up ? I didn 't sound the monster alarm . But I think he 's here . - Where ? - Under the bed . You know sometimes monsters aren 't all that bad . Sometimes if you get to spend some time with them they can be very surprising . They can be , uh , incredibly sweet and pure and capable of great , great love . And then , one of them might actually become your very , very best friend . But you 're my best friend . Yeah , that 's right . - Are you going to work ? - Yeah . Come check on me when you get back ? I will . Patricia , this is Agent Dunham and Peter Bishop . - Hello . - Hi . I 'm , uh ... I 'm sorry . I know that what we 're asking you to do is difficult . Frankly , it all seems a bit beyond comprehension . Last week was our granddaughter 's first birthday . You should have seen the way Jim held her in his arms , so happy . And now the thought that he was really this thing ... Patricia . If this is too much for you ... No , I want to be here . I wanna know who did this to my husband . That 's what we 're hoping to find . Are you ready ? I 'm ready . Hi , James . It 's me , Patricia . Can you hear me ? - Is that what you want ? - Oh , that 's perfect . But if you could please talk to him , not at him . Okay . It 's quiet in the house without you . I finished the curtains . I can 't sleep . It 's just something to do . No , no , no . This is not good . Um ... Maybe if you could touch him , um ... Perhaps a gentle caress , uh , or tickle . Excuse me ? - Uh , I 'm just suggesting possible ways to ... - No , it okay . I understand . Jim the kids have been asking for you . Grayson called yesterday . - Neural activity 's rising . - Hmm . Lucy said her first word . " Shoes . " It 's working . We 're close . I 've been thinking of all the years we had . I know it wasn 't always easy . I 'm sorry I didn 't know you were gone . I don 't know how I didn 't know . You would 've known . I know you would have . Walter , the lower base of his spine . No . Something 's wrong . That doesn 't make any sense . I don 't know if you can ever forgive me , but , I 'm sorry , I 'm so ... Ten , 12 , Whitefield . Eleven , 13 , 16 , Beaufain . - What 's happening ? - I don 't know . - Essex ... - It could be cipher text , code , maybe ? - No , he 's on a loop . - Eleven , 13 , 16 , Beaufain . - Stop it ! - That 's enough . What was that ? I don 't know . Maybe we triggered a corrupted file , a mishmash of discarded data . No . I know what that was . Next month was our anniversary . The Beaufain , the Whitefield , the Essex , they 're all hotels . We were leaving November 10th . We 're done here . Let me take you home . Did it help ? Did you find what you were looking for ? You 've done more than enough . It 's no use . There has to be a way to salvage more data . Shapeshifter 's system 's too badly damaged . Any data in there is likely lost . One thing I do know for sure . I am no longer high . Walter , why don 't we take a break and get something to eat ? I don 't have an appetite . Well , maybe just a change of scenery . Might clear your head . Make you feel better . - I suppose so . - Good . I thought you said you weren 't hungry . I 'm eating for comfort . To think what I put that poor woman through and the most activity we saw occurred in the shapeshifter 's ass . It was his lower spine , Walter . Look ! Animal cookies . You love these . No , Belly loved them . I occasionally eat them to honor him , that is all . Walter , I 'm just trying to cheer you up . Thank you . Belly always thought that dinosaur cookies would 've been a better idea . Velociraptor . Mm . Dilophosaurus . Yum . I was more of a stegosaurus fan myself . That was Belly 's favorite too . Funny thing about the stegosaurus ... Walter ? Walter , what just happened ? I 'll be right back . Oh . Don 't eat my pudding . Okay . Did you know that the stegosaurus had a brain in its ass ? Why didn 't I think of it ? The stegosaurus has a massive , uh , cluster of nerves above the rump . The sacral ganglion . Evolutionary leap separating short-term memory from long-term memory . Belly , you ingenious son of a bitch . - Dr. Bishop , go right ahead . - Thank you . Uh , you 're not authorized to be up here . Police are strictly working the lobby . Sir ? Patricia Van Horn was living with a shapeshifter for two years . She must have noticed something different . Oh , well , shapeshifters are good at their job , you know . I 've been thinking about it . Maybe she did notice . She just made excuses for herself not to have to deal with it . Or she came up with ways to explain it to herself . - Kind of like I 've been doing with you . - With me ? Yeah . With all the little differences since you got back from the Other Side . Your experiences on the Other Side changed you but since you got back , it 's like ... It 's like you 're a different person . You seem less burdened . You 're more patient with Walter . I mean , don 't get me wrong , I like it . The change is good . But it 's different . Hey . Hey . - Where 's Walter ? - I don 't know . He said he 'd be right back . - Astrid , I need you to adjust that light . - Step away from him . Stay right there . Don 't move . It was in his spine . I was right . Yeah . You were right . He 's probably gone to the restroom . No , he left his pudding . Something must be wrong . Excuse me . Hey ! That cop . It must 've been him . Look for Walter , I 'll go after the shapeshifter . Walter ? Walter ! Walter . Walter , look at me . - Hey , Walter . Walter . Hey . - Son ? The stegosaurus , Peter , has two brains . That 's what they were after . I , uh ... I couldn 't find him . So is he all right ? Unh . Uh , he took a bad knock on the head . - I 'll be fine . - Okay . Uh , this is Dunham . We 're on Floor 23 . I need the EMTs here now , please . There was someone here ... We know . There was a shapeshifter here . And they took what we were after . They took the data out of Van Horn . - Help me up . - Walter ? Walter , oh , my God ! What ... ? Walter , are you okay ? Under the circumstances , I 'm fine . I could have been killed . - What 're you doing ? - The security cameras . We can ID the shapeshifter . Catch him before he changes bodies . - Oh , come on . - Peter . Ownership has its privileges . You didn 't shift . I didn 't have to . I got it . Don 't worry about them . I took care of it . We 're clean . Why did you do that ? I didn 't . I couldn 't understand your hesitation . I saw it , but I didn 't understand it . I do now . It 's them , isn 't it ? - I got the disc . I found a way ... - Now it 's time for you to move on . No . - This is my life ... - Now you 'll have another life . Just like you had another one before . This is simply a way station for you . A stop along the way . It 's what we do . It 's what we 're made for . No , no , no . They mean so much to me , and I 've come to mean so much to them . How can you ask me to give them up ? I suppose I can 't . Keep your hands where I can see them ! Get back in your car ! I need to reach Agent Broyles . Newton . Newton , where is it ? - Is he alive ? - Where is it ? He 's breathing , yeah . - Does he have the disc ? - I can 't find it but , uh , we can search properly when I get him into custody . All right . Is the Van Horn disc secure ? It is . You 're gonna have a very difficult time without me . Well , there are plenty of machines here . I can befriend a vacuum cleaner . You 're very good at that . At what ? At continuing to try to convince yourself that you don 't care . But you do care , don 't you ? Every night , when your head hits the pillow in the last moments before you go to sleep your emotions betray you and you question your ability to pull this off . Words like " integrity , " " self-respect , " they haunt you . They form a line that you 're unwilling to cross . And that will lead to your undoing . But I suppose that 's not my problem anymore . Here you go . I lied to you . About what ? Uh , I don 't wanna talk .

 NARRATOR : Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least , it used to be . Until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible , inescapable . We 're trapped . NARRATOR : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . [ angle SCREAMS ] Thanks for letting me crash here . My husband isn 't here , but he 'll turn up . - You 'll see , Barbie . PETER : Shut up ! [ GUNSHOT ] PAUL : That thing is never gonna go away . linda : Oh , no . No . [ DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ] [ FOOTSTEPS approaching ] - Morning . - Morning . Feeling okay ? Yeah , it 's just a headache . I get them sometimes when I 'm stressed . barbie : Yeah , you took the last one . Dee 's Pharmacy is closed . - Maybe the gas station has aspirin . - You know this town pretty well for someone who 's just passing through . Dee 's is not really a hard name to remember . julia : Think I 'll go over to the radio station . All right , well , I 'll catch a ride with you . MAN [ ON PA ] : All right , everybody , orders are in . Pack it up , we 're out of here . MAN : Hey , you can 't leave ! [ CROWD clamoring ] linda : Back away , Ollie . Back away . This thing could really hurt you . ollie : Why is the military leaving ? We 're American citizens . The military is supposed to protect us . linda : Everybody , listen . I understand that you 're angry , but I 'm gonna ask you to disperse . Now ! [ CROWD clamoring ] LESTER : You weep for mercy when you 've lived lives of wickedness and pride . God does not hear you . He is the master and you will bend to his will . - Go home . This is not helping . LESTER : There they cry , but none giveth answer , because of the pride of evil men . This dome is his wish for a new Eden . - What the hell 's going on ? - Military 's leaving . It 's been three days and no answers . Folks are getting scared . You think pulling a gun is gonna reassure them ? All right , all right , I don 't blame you for wanting answers . We all wanna know when this thing is coming down , but this is not helping . ollie : Government 's left us here to rot . You 're a councilman , Rennie . Why should we trust you ? Because they 're out there , Ollie , and I 'm in here . Now , please , listen to the sheriff . Soon as we know what 's going on out there , so will you . Now go on home . MAN : Come on . - You almost lost them . - I had it under control . What are you gonna do , open fire on the crowd ? Linda ? Excuse me . - Is she all right ? - You okay ? - Let 's get out of here . - Let 's get her to a car . [ DOOR rattling ] Brought you some comfortable clothes . And a surprise . [ sniffs ] You wore this the first time we danced . Junior prom . You were so beautiful . You want me to look beautiful ? I don 't mind . You 're starting to act like the old Angie I knew before the dome came down . Turn around . I think you 're getting better . With trust and a little patience , I 'll get her back . - Right , Ange ? Ange ? - Argh ! - I 'm sorry . - No , you 're not . No , I 'm sorry . I should have known . You 're not better . You 're just pretending . Junior , please , let me out . I won 't tell anyone . I will forget everything . Please , I will forget about everything . Just let me out . You can leave whenever you 're ready . But not before . Can I help you ? I 'm Julia Shumway . I 'm the editor of the weekly - MAN : Yeah , I recognize your voice . You 're the lady that 's been doing the news on the radio . - That why you 're looking for Phil ? - Phil ? Phil Bushey , the DJ you work with at the station . That 's his car . He 's gotta be home . That 's my husband 's car . Phil ! - What is all the racket ? - What are you doing with Peter 's car ? He sold it to me . [ phil GROANS ] - I feel like crap . - Phil . I need some help ! One seizure happens , maybe it 's no big deal . Two seizures in three days buys you both a full workup . - Mom , I feel fine . - Yeah , me too . I know , but we have to be sure . Excuse me , I 'm a physician . We may be dealing with something infectious that 's causing seizures in both of them . I want you to do a blood count , an EEG , and if they 're negative , get them MRls . We can do the blood and the EEG here , but the closest mri is at the big hospital in Westlake , five miles outside of the dome . I don 't suppose you have a neurologist . We 're fresh out of doctors . Look , one of them 's on vacation in Vail . The other drove his Porsche into the dome . - Dr. Shumway is mia . - Then I 'll do the tests . - What kind of doctor are you ? - She 's a psychiatrist . - She did her internship in medicine . - Come with me . Your moms are pretty hardcore . You have no idea . All right , I 'll be right there , okay ? Hey , Junior , you haven 't seen my sister , have you ? I haven 't seen her since the dome came down . Angie ? - Saw her a couple nights ago . - Where ? I don 't know , around . Anything else , little man ? I guess not . NURSE : What 's going on with her ? jim : She collapsed - and now she 's burning up . junior : Dad ? Junior , what happened to your hand ? Oh , chopping wood . Ax slipped . - Feeling okay ? - What happened with Linda ? jim : I don 't know . ADAMS : We need some help . More people are coming in with fever and headache . jim : What are we dealing with here ? - I don 't know , it could be the flu . We need more cots up in the basement . barbie : I 'll get it . - Junior , help Barbie . - He passed out . ADAMS : Put him in Bay 3 . - What happened to Linda ? jim : She passed out too , probably from the same thing that happened to Phil . - What 's going on ? - Wish I could tell you , Mrs. Shumway . The town 's out of doctors . Sure could use your husband . [ sighs ] Help ! Help ! Help ! Ah ! NORRlE : Ow ! - Sweetheart , keep still . Oh , you suck at this . No wonder you became a shrink . There , done . - Will you run this to the lab ? - Sure . So how 's this thing work ? It measures the electronic activity in your brain . Is everything normal ? NORRlE : Nope , you 're a mutant like Wolverine . JOE : You know X-Men ? NORRlE : I know a lot of stuff . JOE : Heh , heh . Norrie , not now . Your brain 's as normal as any EEG I 've ever seen . Then why 'd we have the seizures ? Alice , Nurse Adams said you 'd be here . We need your help right away . Stay . jim : I know this may sound crazy , but we 're lucky you got trapped here in Chester 's Mill . WOMAN : Excuse me . - What 's going on ? - You tell me . ADAMS : We need your help . I 'll need a mask and gloves - before I examine anyone . - We 're out of both . - What about antibiotics ? - We have that for now . alice : Okay . - Why are you here ? barbie : Linda got sick . Jim and I brought her in . Why ? What are you doing here ? I just brought in a friend of yours , Phil Bushey . Go on up ahead . I 'll catch up with you . If you 've never been to Chester 's Mill before , how do you know Phil ? I have no idea what you 're talking about . You went through my stuff ? You lied about having a fight with Junior Rennie . So , yeah , I thought I would check up on maybe what else you lied about . You owe me an explanation . - Barbie , just tell me the truth . alice : Whoa , whoa . julia : I 'm okay . I just have a headache . alice : Let 's get her to the treatment area . Set those cots up down there . We are getting slammed . Ms. Moore ? Linda Esquivel . You were my third-grade teacher . Of course . I remember you , Linda . You were an amazing teacher . Oh , you were a terrible student . [ CHUCKLES ] Do you think it 's the dome ? Is that what 's making us sick ? I don 't know , Ms. Moore . I don 't know . Dad , what the hell is going on around here ? Some kind of outbreak . Doctor , what exactly is going on here ? I think it could be meningitis . My cousin had that . It 's bad . One minute he was fine , the next he was dying . We can 't be sure , because the clinic doesn 't have any spinal tap kits . But the symptoms : high fever , neck pain , photophobia . I 'd be surprised if it was anything else . I think we may have an epidemic on our hands . jim : An epidemic ? How contagious is it ? Very . If anyone who 's sick coughs , it spreads . This damn dome . It 's like an incubator . Your son probably got vaccinated when he went to college . So did my family , so we 're okay . barbie : Yeah , I got mine in the military . Yeah . Well , what about those who didn 't ? alice : Well , if there 's no symptoms , swallow an antibiotic and you 're protected . But for these people who are sick , they need antibiotics , and they need them fast . So then how much time are we talking about ? Oh , 11 , maybe 12 hours , but that 's not our only problem . I checked . We don 't have enough antibiotics to treat all these people . - Dee 's Pharmacy . - Listen , doctor . Give me a list of what you need . Let me be absolutely clear . If these people leave and it spreads ... Well , we 're gonna make sure it doesn 't . junior : Got that list from that doctor . - Thanks . Go inside . Guard the door . Make sure no one gets out . - Like a quarantine ? - Call it what you like . Nobody leaves . I 'm counting on you , Junior . The clinic is now closed . No one leaves , you understand ? No one . [ GRUNTlNG ] Junior ! Junior ! [ screaming ] - Phil . - What ? Phil , I need to know how you ended up with Peter 's car . Peter , I 'm sorry , man , I can 't make it to the cabin tonight . Cabin ? What cabin ? - What are you doing out of bed ? - I think that he knows where Peter is . Where my husband is . I need to talk to him . Well , okay , give him a few hours for his antibiotics to kick in . And you should go back to bed until Big Jim comes back with your dose . phil : Dodee , don 't go . - He 's hallucinating . One of the later symptoms of meningitis . It 's a good thing that you brought him in when you did . Go back to bed . jim : What the hell ? Damn it . Whoever did this took everything . How many are we up to ? At least 30 with advanced symptoms . Another two dozen with early signs . - Any news from Big Jim ? - Not yet . You don 't look well . Are you sure you haven 't caught - ? We got vaccinated , remember , when we took that safari to Africa ? I took my insulin without eating . CAROLYN : How much do you have left ? Can we please talk about this later ? How much ? - Definitely a few days ' worth . - Okay . I 'm gonna get you something to eat and you 're gonna eat it . ADAMS : Dr. Calvert . [ EKG BEEPlNG ] Linda 's temp 's 104 and Ms. Moore 's BP is falling . - How much antibiotic do we have left ? - One dose . MOORE : Give Linda the medicine . I 'll wait till the next round . There 's no way I 'm gonna take it . Go ahead , give Linda the dose . [ siren wailing ] EMT [ OVER radio ] : Medical , this is Rescue 1 . - You need to let me out . - Sorry . Orders from my dad . Nobody leaves until we get this thing under control . Junior . James , you don 't understand . I think that my husband might be in trouble . How ? julia : What ... Unh . All I know is that Phil said that he was meeting Peter in a cabin . Like the one I found Barbie at ? What are you talking about ? A few days ago , I followed Barbie to this cabin . End of Sparrow 's Lane . - You need to let me out . - I wish I could , but I can 't . [ BEEP ] barbie : At least whoever took all that medicine couldn 't have gotten far . jim : Because of the dome ? - Yeah . And with a haul that size , no way they 're getting away on foot . So we 're looking for a truck or a van . jim : Or a hearse . What , your reverend ? What the hell would he be doing with drugs ? Nothing good . His wrath burns like fire . What the hell are you doing ? Honoring his plan . When I heard folks got sick , I broke into Dee 's Pharmacy . What are you , insane ? People will die without that medicine . Those people are supposed to die . It 's God 's plan . Trust me . He 's the only one who decides who lives and dies under his dome . - There 's nothing you can do about it . - Unload the car . [ GROANS ] What 's happening ? They gave you antibiotics . You should be on the mend soon . And how are you feeling ? I 've been better . If you told me yesterday that the idea of Junior Rennie brandishing a shotgun would be reassuring , ha , ha , I 'd have laughed my head off . Actually , I might have said that about you a few years ago . Wasn 't exactly the teacher 's pet , was I ? With that mouth of yours ? - Lord , no . - Heh , heh , heh . But now look at you . The town sheriff . I 've had a lot of help , though . Especially from Duke Perkins . May he rest in peace . But don 't sell yourself short . Ms. Moore ? [ EKG BEEPS ] Ms. Moore ? Help ! We need help in here ! alice : She 's coding . Starting chest compressions . One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , 11 , 12 , - I was just talking to her . - 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 . Come on . ollie : Out of the way , Junior . MAN 1 : You 've no right to keep us here . MAN 2 : Right . MAN 3 : Yeah . ollie : Can 't stop all of us with that gun . - Step back . MEN : Whoa . MAN 1 : Hey , guys . MAN 2 : Hey , hey , hey . Let 's go . [ GUNSHOT AND PEOPLE screaming ] linda : Junior . Mr. Densmore , you remember when my mother died ? And your wife , she made that amazing corn bread . From your own field , she said . Even gave me the skillet . I remember . Now I 'm in here , with you , with this , not to point a gun at you , but because I live here and I 'm one of you . We have got to fight through this thing together and trust that we 're all in here for a reason . I believe in this town . I believe in my dad . And I believe in you . Oh , Peter . [ panting ] [ CAMERA clicking ] This is all I could scrounge up . - It 's a zoo out there . - Thanks . What are we gonna do when we run out of , like , peanut butter and jelly and bread ? What are we gonna eat ? We 'll get out before then . All right , so I was thinking ... Our seizures ? The last time one happened was after we touched . - Yeah , could 've been a coincidence . - Both of us ? At the same exact time ? What if we triggered it ? Okay , how would that happen ? I don 't know , but we should test it . Like , touch again ? Yeah . Unless , you know , you 're scared . No , I 'm not scared . We should film it . - Here , get on the floor . - All right . But if you pee your pants , just know there will be video evidence . Same goes for you . - You ready ? - Let 's do it . Okay , I feel stupid . [ electricity ZAPS ] [ HORN honking ] Got the antibiotics . MAN 1 : Bring it straight on in to the charge nurse . - Any problems in there ? - Not at all . MAN 2 : We got it . Right behind you . [ GRUNTS ] Help ! Junior ! So where 's Julia ? Not a clue , man . I barely know where I am . What did you tell her ? - What did she ask you ? - It 's blurry , but I think it was about her husband . Relax , it 's not like he 's gonna say anything about you . He 's gone . What do you mean , he 's gone ? Gone like gone . Like , " Adios , Peter Shumway . " About a month ago , he came to me asking if I knew any hit men . - He asked you about hit men ? - I know , right ? And I told him that crap was only in the movies . He was in a bad way . He sold me his car for a steal . I told him if things were that bad , he should take the cash and buy the first bus ticket out of here and start over . Sorry , man . I don 't know how much he owed you . You ain 't getting that cash back . And how much of this did you tell her ? It 's tough to say . I was pretty out of it . [ barbie patting phil ] Peter ? Hey there , Red . Why didn 't you tell me ? I 'll tell you soon . Norrie ? Wake up . You feel anything ? I don 't remember . JOE : Well , let 's check out the video . I 'll rewind it . Okay , here we go . NORRlE : Okay , I feel stupid . [ electricity ZAPS ] JOE : Pink stars are falling . NORRIE : Pink stars are falling . - Pink stars are falling in lines . NORRlE : Pink stars ? I don 't get it . Shh . NORRIE : Pink stars are falling in lines . - Do you remember doing that ? JOE : No . No way . - What does this mean ? - I don 't know . Maybe we 're not supposed to tell anyone . JOE : Norrie ? - Why not ? JOE : Norrie ? Wake up . Because the dome doesn 't want us to . NORRlE : What happened ? JOE : You feel anything ? - Hey , have you seen Julia ? junior : Why ? Did she wise up and ditch you ? She needs antibiotics . When 's the last time you saw her ? Couple hours ago . She kept asking about a cabin . What did you tell her ? I just mentioned the place I saw you a couple days ago . Give me keys to your truck . - No . - Hey . Now , she left on your watch . She 's sick and she will die out there , so give me the keys to your truck . Peter . [ shivering ] jim : All right , you were a brave little girl back there . Okay , get home and get better . She 's good . WOMAN : Thanks . jim : Well , well , well . Look who came back from the dead . I heard you saved the day . Well , that 's what I do . Well , your son takes after you too . jim : Oh , yeah ? He stopped what could have been a full-blown riot . People were freaking out and he talked them down . Chip off the old block . You ever consider a career in law enforcement ? Was that you ? Was that me what ? Was that you who saved my life ? I learned about Peter in that cabin . We 're broke . He emptied our accounts . And the house is in foreclosure . So , what were you all into ? Drugs ? [ CHUCKLES ] When I got out of the military , I did , um ... I had a bunch of odd jobs . I was a line cook . Construction . And then , um ... Then I linked up with a bookie out of Westlake . Taking bets ? Making sure that people paid what they owed . You 're an enforcer . Guys like Phil owed and they paid up . And most of the time , it 's like that . Peter never gambled . PETER [ ON recording ] : I 've got the cash , but my wife 's home . Meet me at the other spot . It 's his voice mail from five days ago . So where is he now ? Please . I have to know . He must have taken off . You know , that happens sometimes . Some guys , they get in so deep and ... You know , they skip town . I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? I let you stay in my house . I trusted you . Your " sorry " means nothing to me . When I get back home , you better be gone . NORRlE : So is the outbreak over ? Well , everyone who 's sick has been treated , and anyone exposed to meningitis got antibiotics . So , yes , it 's over . How do you guys feel ? Any more seizures ? No , we 're fine . CAROLYN : What have you two been doing all day ? Oh , you know , just making out and stuff . Right , it 's the " stuff " that usually worries us . I am beat . Can we go home , please ? Home ? It 's a room above a diner . You have any better ideas , kiddo ? JOE : Well , I do . I mean , both my parents are outside the dome , and there 's more than enough room at my house . It 's just me , so you guys could stay there . Please , don 't say no . Please ? Thanks , Joe , that would be great . CAROLYN : I 'll grab our stuff and meet you in the car . Babe , what are you doing ? Are you stealing insulin ? You yourself said you only had a week 's supply left . Alice , look what happened today . We almost ran out of antibiotics for everyone . What happens when we run out ? Okay , what 's going on ? You 're not acting like yourself . I 'm scared . What if the dome lasts forever ? It won 't . We will get out of here . Soon . I promise . junior : Sure you 'll be okay ? - Yeah . - Thanks for the ride . - Yeah . - It 's not your fault , you know . - What isn 't ? Mrs. Moore . She died saving my life . She knew how important you are to this town . To all of us . I 'm not the only one . What you did today saved a lot of lives . The way you did it . Duke always said the greatest weapon we have as police is a good heart . Mrs. Moore was right . About what ? We have come a long way . [ swing SQUEAKlNG ] If you came here to apologize , don 't bother . I have nothing to apologize for . I came to give you this . My share of the profits . Keep all the propane . I 'm gonna wash my hands of our dirty little business . [ LAUGHS ] Little late for that , Lester . Never too late to repent . You think you 've saved this town , but you 've damned them . You defied God 's will . And for that , you 'll pay . Lucky I didn 't haul your ass into jail for what you did today . Luck has nothing to do with it . You can 't hurt me without hurting yourself . God bless . [ shivering ] Help ! [ angle screaming faintly ] [ pipe rattling ] [ angle screaming faintly ]

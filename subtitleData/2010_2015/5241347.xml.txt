 Previously on Alphas ... Someone close to us is working with Stanton Parish . You said that you would bring him around to our way of thinking , but you two are farther apart than you 've ever been . Do you understand everything I 'm risking for this ? This is actually pretty friggin ' perfect . I love you , you know that ? I want you to put your hands on your head . I want you to lay face down . Easy . You turned her in ! You 're supposed to protect her . I just want to forget . I want to disappear . No . There 's an opportunity here . Yes . There is a way out . This is the plea agreement . You need to initial , uh , the boxes that are highlighted and , uh ... And yes , sign the last page . The paperwork . Right . Uh , I do hereby solemnly swear to go undercover , cozy up to Stanton Parish , and figure out what he 's planning . Uh , rat him out . So , I 'll take it to Cley . Dad . Just breathe , okay ? I 'm a big girl . I don 't need training wheels . Well , there 's a lot more at stake than a skinned knee , Dani . Stanton Parish is a sociopath . You know , he 's ... I know . But he trusts me . I got this . I 'll be okay . Dani missed our last meeting and hasn 't responded to my check-in signals for over a week . Cley thinks that she still may be loyal to Parish , but I 'm concerned she might be in trouble . So you sent her in there ? You actually sent her back to him ? Doc , don 't you think I should have been brought in on this ? - It was for operational security reasons ... - No , no , this was between us . We had an agreement , right ? Right , Dr. Rosen ? No , Bill . Cley insisted and I agreed . The fewer people who knew , the less risk there would be to Dani . Oh , and keeping Dani safe , that was your first priority , huh ? If she hadn 't agreed to this , Cameron , she would have spent the rest of her life in Building Seven . Or worse . She comes up with that brilliant idea herself , Doc ? Or did you head shrink that into her ? That 's uncalled for . Uncalled for ? Calm down ! You put your daughter 's head on the block . And I 'm out of order ? Relax ! You know what ? I 'm starting to think she 's better off with Parish . Hicks , please . Hicks , come on ... Rachel . Rachel . Cameron . Cameron , you and I should talk ... No , we shouldn 't . I did what I had to do to protect my daughter . Really ? Because the way I see it , Dani would 've been perfectly safe sitting in Building Seven while you pulled your little strings to get her pardoned . I couldn 't guarantee that ... No , you chose ! You chose to risk her life . You 're using her just like you use everyone . Cameron , stop ... Get the hell outta my way ! DARPA is saying three intruders . And one of them melted the fence with his hand . Cornell Scipio . I hate that guy . Gary , any word from Hicks ? No , Bill . I left him 14 messages . He should call me back . Sir ! Stop right there ! Stop right there ! Drop those bags ! Is that Cam ? What the hell is he doing ? We 'll be over by the truck . Go ! Jeff , move your ass ! We are leaving ! Hicks ! Hicks ! Get in there ! What the hell are you doing ? Whatever it takes . Harken , stop ! Sayonara , suckers ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Well , maybe it 's a protest . Hicks finally had it . That happens . Occupy DARPA . Power to the people . But that 's not like Hicks , you know ? It doesn 't sound like him . I know . But that 's , that 's the theory , though . That 's my theory , which is the best one so far , because it 's the only one . But , look , it 's gotta be Dani . Nothing else makes sense . Okay , that 's your theory . Nina , what 's your theory ? Why is he doing this ? I trust him . That 's my theory . Careful with those , they 're like the Fourth of July , but with dead people . You got it . That 's a good haul , almost a hundred . What exactly are those things for ? Well , that 's " need to know " and you don 't . So how do you think Rosen 's people found us ? Probably Gary , maybe Rachel . Rosen 's been using Alphas to hunt Alphas for as long as I 've known him . If you hate the old man so much , why didn 't you just kill him before you left ? Dani . That 's why you 're doing all of this ? Such a romantic . This is what they stole . It 's called a Voltaic Grenade . So what does it do ? It fires off electricity . And if the charge hits power lines or anything with a live current , it overloads them , setting off a chain reaction . That 's neat . DARPA doesn 't make neat things . There 's nothing neat about this , Gary . That electrical storm at DARPA took down three people , and that 's off one of these grenades . And it would have gotten us , too , if we were a few feet closer . If you set just one these off in the wrong place , a subway junction box or anywhere where a bunch of power lines cross , hundreds of people could die . And multiply that by 60 or 70 grenades , that 's a lot of people . Why would Cameron go along with something like this ? You have a theory , Dr. Rosen ? And you can 't say that you trust him or that it 's Dani , because we 've already said those . Yeah , well , motives are not what 's important right now . No , preventing Parish from deploying these weapons is . But we need to find Hicks and Dani ... Yes , we do , but that 's of secondary importance right now . Unfortunately , this is job number one . It 's not just Dani . Rosen , the government , everyone 's trying to control us like we 're some kind of problem . I want to be the solution . Well , you talk the talk . I 'll give you that . Look , I got Parish his little toys . Now tell him to sit down with me , face-to-face . Well , you 're getting there . There 's something you have to do first . This way . Agnes . This is Cameron Hicks . Tall ? Stanton thought we should talk . I got nothing to hide . When it comes to Agnes , nobody does . Sorry I have to tie you down . Safer this way . Kinky . Do you do this to all of Parish 's people ? I 'm the official greeter . Right . So , what are you gonna do ? Are you gonna hypnotize me , or just ask me really nicely ? When I touch someone , it rips open their mind . That doesn 't sound very pleasant . You might want to clench your jaw . Does that help ? No . I just don 't want you to bite off your tongue . So , Cameron Hicks . What 's on your mind ? Ahhh ! All this time , your dad 's been telling us that Parish is the Big Bad , right ? Everyone else was all about Alpha rights , government oppression . But all Parish wanted to talk about was how screwed up the world is and how Alphas could fix it . " Better people , better world . " Catchy . If you really want answers , I could dig through some old contact numbers and you could have lunch . Seriously ? You 're cute when you 're confused . You okay ? Oh , yeah . I 'm great . Thanks . Try this . It helps . You like your privacy . You have a lot of strong walls in there . Trust me , I am trying to be open . You 're very convincing . I wish I didn 't have to cause you so much pain . Oh , yeah . It sucks for you . It does , actually . You can 't turn it off . No . I hurt everyone I touch . You 're lucky , the way you feel about Dani . Not everyone gets that . You know , I met her once , a long time ago . But I have a feeling I 'm going to see her again soon . There 's still something in there . Something ... Out of focus . Well , we can 't have that , can we ? Let 's go . Hey , Gary . Hey . Isn 't it a little early for your pudding ? No , I can eat it whenever I want . It 's mine . I bought it with my own money . Look , I know there 's a lot of strangers . Yeah . They 're just here to help us find the grenades . Hicks was my friend . And Dani is Dr. Rosen 's daughter . But now that they 're breaking the law , they 're hurting people , now I don 't like either of them . I don 't . Sometimes people do things for complicated reasons . I know it 's painful , believe me . Do you want this ? You want my pudding ? I have an extra one . It 's okay . You might need it . Oh , Gary . Gary , listen . Yeah . I need you to do me a favor . I need you to look into that DARPA robbery . The way Hicks was acting , you know . It 's just not adding up . We don 't know if Hicks is a good person or a bad person . Because sometimes people do things for complicated reasons . Yeah . Tell me about it . May I ? No , that 's my bookmark . I 'm sorry . Okay . How about that ? You 're going to need a spoon . Maybe not . That 's gross , Bill . Ahh . So , did I pass ? Agnes gave you top marks . Why the surprise , hmm ? You know why I 'm here . Dani . She 's a very special girl . It 's just not Dani . " Better people , better world . " You 're here because of a slogan ? When can I see her ? That is not possible right now . But I am glad to see you 're okay , Mr. Hicks . Wait . Where is she ? She 's comfortable . I 'm keeping her safe until I find out where her loyalties lie . Dani 's the one that told me that you 're the good guy and now you 're saying that you don 't even trust her ? Some of her recent actions have shaken my faith . Agnes says that she thinks she 'll be seeing her soon . Did she ? You 'll never know how much I care about Danielle , Mr. Hicks , and I would never want to cause her any pain . But as you just pointed out , it 's seemingly inevitable . Welcome aboard , Mr. Hicks . Get some rest . I 'm heading home . All right . Did you even eat today ? Nina , I can 't recall . Those grenades , it 's all my fault they 're out there . At DARPA , I ... You did your best . No . But I shouldn 't have let ... Nina , it 's my responsibility . Whatever happens to Cameron , or Dani , or anyone , it 's my responsibility . You shouldn 't have to carry that alone . Yes , I should . There 're some hard-boiled eggs in the fridge , and some of that frozen oatmeal you like . Thank you . Have a good night . Yeah . Stanton . I had a conversation with your Cameron Hicks today . Cam ? Seems he recently joined our cause , I assume to find you . Don 't hurt him . I don 't want to hurt anyone , Danielle . That 's why I 'm here . To give you one last chance to change my mind . You know when I started to doubt you ? When I told you the truth about the world we 're creating . At that moment , there it was , betrayal in your eyes . Oh . No , I was ... Surprised , confused . I mean , the things you were telling me . How did you expect me to react ? I expected you to understand . The human race is evolving into something magnificent . But not quite fast enough . Forty years at the most and then there 's only one possible result . I know , collapse . That 's a pleasant word for it . The population outstrips the planet 's capacity to provide . Sacrifices must be made . Culling the herd . Stanton , these sacrifices ? You 're talking about killing people . You 're talking about mass murder . If we do nothing , billions will still die . All that will be left will be ashes . But when we succeed , and we will succeed , an ideal world with resources for all . The human race , perfected . Ashes or Paradise . Which would you choose ? It 's started , hasn 't it ? That 's why you told me . Just the first step . The first of a hundred , a thousand . I want you with me . You 're my family . I feel the same way about you . I want to believe you . One must be certain . Agnes Walker will be calling on you shortly . Take her below . All right , people , move . Out of here , now . Make coffee , do whatever the hell you gotta do , but move . What 's the matter ? You need a lawyer . What are you talking about ? Hicks . Yeah , he 's gonna arrest you now . Because of what you did . We figured it out . You helped him escape , didn 't you ? At DARPA . What the hell are you doing ? Whatever it takes . Harken ! Just stop ! Let him go . I had him . Then he 's gone . I couldn 't figure out how . There was something wrong with the timeline . But I figured it all out . Bill lost six minutes and 14 seconds . Bill , just calm down ... No , I 'm not gonna calm down . You pushed me . Why ? And don 't say that people do things for complicated reasons . That 's not an answer . It 's true . Bill , just come into my office and we can talk about this in private . Hell , no ! So you can push me again ? You helped Parish get his hands on those bombs so he could kill thousands of people . No , no . It 's not like ... Oh , shut up ! It 's not like that ! Shut up ! You know what ? I did what I had to do . So why don 't you save your self-righteous indignation for when I actually deserve it ? Come here , Nina . No . Screw you . Come here , Nina . Screw you ! No , Doc , Doc . No , Bill . No . Doc , Doc ... Bill . Please get out of the way . I 'm gonna arrest her this time . Before you do anything , we need to talk . You sure you want to do this ? You know better than to question me , Miss Walker . I need to know what she told her father and what she intends to tell him . Would you like to stick around ? See for yourself . No . I need to accelerate matters . We deploy grenades tonight . She spooked you , and she was always the one you trusted the most . She made me doubt . We can 't have that . It 's been a while , Dani . We 're not so different , are we ? We both feel what other people feel . Do you ever hurt them , the ones you touch ? All the time . Cam ! Dani ! Agnes , don 't ! You 're here to rescue her . I love her . How did you do it ? How did I not see ? Cam ... I can still scream for help . I need to know . Please , please . I don 't want to talk to him . Cameron , you 're gonna want to hear what I have to say . This isn 't about you and me . It 's about Dani . We figured out a way to save her . But we need your help . With this adenosine and the other inhibitors . And after some careful pushes from Nina , you should be able resist any sort of probe . Cam , you sure you want to do this ? I 'm ready . Find Dani . Find Dani . Whatever it takes . Whatever it takes . You did all that ? For her ? I 'll give you 10 minutes . Come on . Let 's go . Come on , come on . Move it . Where are we going ? What 's next ? No . We 're done , okay ? Your father should 've never sent you back to Parish . Now , we 're getting out of here . No . I didn 't come back here for my father . Dani ... No . Cam , I 'm a junkie and a liar . This is my chance to do something good . Parish is planning something that 's gonna kill a lot of people . I can 't walk away . I won 't . Do you know where Parish is right now ? Did you find anything out ? He had me take these grenades that weaponize electrical current . He sounds like he 's gonna deploy them tonight . Heard one of his guys say something about a shipping depot or something . Shipping ? Parish owns a shipping company in Weehawken . Move , move . Let 's go . Hello ? Hello , Dani . Oh , thank God . You should all know that 's she 's alive . Dani is alive . Cameron saved her . Yay . That 's good news . Yeah . However , Parish 's people are apparently assembling some sort of device using the grenades , all of them . Wire enough of those together , set them off at the right point in the power system , and the main line will carry the blast straight into Manhattan . A million people could die . Tell me what you see , Eddie . A lot of heat in Newark and the main Jersey Central lines . Look at that , there 's a concert going on at the Meadowlands . It 's glowing . Focus down . We need the most active power conduit leading into the city . Con Ed 23 , Jersey Central , 1-A-3 . It 's a straight shot into Manhattan . You hear that , Mr. Scipio ? 1-A-3 . Got it . We got our target . Sweet . Are you ready for this ? Yeah . Cam ! Cam , look out ! Bad ninja ! Let her go ! Oh , you 're not going anywhere . Someone wants to talk to you . Hey , Kimi ! Shh ! Cam ! Cam , look at me ! Don 't listen to her ! Cam ! Cam , look at me ! Look at me ! Don 't listen ! Cam ! No , no , no , Cam . Cam , please ! Put it down ! Put it down ! Put it down , baby . Cam , look at me . You don 't want to do this . Cam ... What 's up ? Hicks ! Nina , help ! Hicks , come on ! Whatever she said , forget it . You don 't want to hurt yourself . Put that down . Dani ? Are you all right ? I 'm okay . Oh , this has all gone so wrong . I 'm sorry . We 've got to get you out of here . Where are the grenades ? Where 's Scipio ? I 've got this . Come on ! Dani ... It 's better if I go alone . Dani ... We 've been over this . Go ! Almost there . Gary , where 's the truck headed ? Where 's the target ? Gary , look for the lines carrying the most power into New York . They would have the biggest impact . Well , yeah . I 'm trying , I 'm trying . You 've got to try harder . Come on , partner . Bill ! I 'm doing my best ! Come on ! Get off ! Cam ! It crashed . Hicks made him crash . What ? Yeah . On Hackensack Plank Road . Okay . Oh . Thanks for coming to get me . What else could I do ? Come on . Give me the gun . Damn it . This is Hicks . I stopped the truck . - Scipio got away . - All right , copy . Gary , are you with me ? Oh , no , I 'm at the office , Bill . You 're in New Jersey . Send the DOD to the crash site now , okay ? Anybody else who 's around . Oh , wait ! I think I 've found the target . They 're there , Bill , Dani and Hicks . What ? What are you talking about ? They 're right there ! They 're at the target . The crash site is the target . It 's here . They 're planning on setting it off here . It looks like they turned the grenades into some kind of I.E.D. It 's got multiple redundant wires . Hicks , you 're lucky it didn 't blow up when it crashed . It 's got a remote trigger . Listen , Gary , send the bomb squad right away . Fire , rescue , everybody . Bomb squad 's driving to you right now . But there was an accident on the George Washington Bridge . They 're gonna be 15 minutes getting to you . No , there 's no time ! Look , Gary , what if we could just disarm it ? You know , you could talk us through it . Find some kind of database or something . No , I can 't . I 'm busy . I only have two hands . Busy doing what ? I 'm saving the world , Bill . Come on . I 'm using the phone that Skylar gave me to access the power company computers . It 's the electricity that kills people , so , if I can just reroute the power ... That might actually stop the chain reaction . Gary , how long will that take ? It 's gonna take a while . It 's very difficult . You couldn 't do this . Damn it . Parish could set this off anytime he wants . We need time . I can get you time . Give me the phone . Trust me . All right . No , no , no . He can 't see you . I got this . Ms. Walker ? Hello , Stanton . Danielle . To what do I owe the pleasure ? Take a look . I 'm standing on top of your bomb . If you really care about me , if I ever meant anything to you at all , just let this go . Dani , you 're not supposed to be there . Please step away . I can 't do that . I can 't let you kill millions of people . We 've already been through this . You understand what 's at stake . Just because you 've believed something for a long time doesn 't make it true . There 's something happening in the grid . Lines are shutting down . Now would be a good time . What if you 're wrong ? What if there 's a way to make the world better without killing anyone ? Danielle , I wish that were true . I don 't want to hurt you . Please don 't make me do this . Dani ! Get out of there ! Why are you stopping me ? She 's buying us some time . What ? Stanton , you taught me to stand for my principles . You taught me that sometimes sacrifices need to be made . I listened . My sweet Danielle , fighting for what she believes in . You are more than I ever could have hoped for . I am so proud of you . You will always be remembered . Run ! Dani ! Oh ! The lights are still on . Oh ! I did it ! I diverted the power ! We stopped Parish . We won ! We ... Oh , no , you can 't hear me ' cause your phone went out . Everyone else can hear me , though . Hey ! We saved New York ! We won ! Everyone ! Lorenzo , we won ! Lorenzo ! The lights are still on . It didn 't work . No . It did what we needed . It has begun . Is everyone all right ? Rachel ? I 'm okay . Bill ? I 'll get there . I 'll look on the others . Where is ... Dani ? Dani ... Oh , God . Dani ? Dani , it 's Daddy . It 's Daddy . Can you hear me ? Uh , Daddy ? I 'm here . Oh , Daddy , please ... Christ . Uhh . Dani , Dani , look at me . Look at me . Dani . I love you . I love you so very much . Please , please stay with me . Please stay . Cameron ! Look at me . Don 't go . Cameron , she 's ... Oh , can 't somebody do something . Nina . Nina ! Nina , please . Dani . Dani , look at me . Do not die . Just stay with us . Do not die . Oh , no . No .

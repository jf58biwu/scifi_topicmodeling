 C.I.C. , bridge . What are we dealing with here ? Sir , e.W. Reports it 's an old version . Of a kirov-class guided missile cruiser . Nuclear powered and possibly carrying warheads . I thought those were mothballed in the ' 90s . They 're old and ugly , but they 're still dangerous . With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking ? I am konstantin nicolayevitch ruskov , A former vice admiral . Of the red banner northern fleet . Of the russian federation . Messenger of the watch . Please go to my at-sea cabin and grab me a book off the shelf , The one in russian . Aye , captain . Admiral , I need to advise you . That you are in United States territorial waters . And are standing into danger . Withdraw seaward or you will be subject to defensive action . Commander chandler , I have pursued you across the globe , But I wish no further conflict . After you have met my demands , You and your crew . Will be free to leave the harbor . And travel the earth as you please . And what would those demands be ? Well , let 's not be coy . You have the primordial strain . Of the virus that is killing the world . You will hand it over to me , along with dr . Rachel scott . And all of her research . Sorry , admiral , but I don 't know what you 're talking about . And the thing is , I don 't take orders from you . Now , I 'm gonna ask you one more time ... move your ship . Your navy and your country no longer exist . There is no higher authority but me . If you don 't do as I say , You and your crew will leave this harbor . Atop a mushroom cloud . You saw what happened to France . You know what my ship is capable of . Admiral ruskov , I suggest we meet somewhere face to face , Negotiate a peaceful solution to our problem . It will be my pleasure . Who else has been working on a vaccine ? What , in the world ? Everyone . What about the russians ? Were they close ? I mean , nobody was making any real progress . And I hate to say it , but they 're probably all dead anyway . Why ? If somebody had the primordial strain of the virus , The stuff you found in the ice , could they make a vaccine ? I suppose , if they had the right equipment . And someone qualified to run it . But they 'd be months behind us . I need to borrow dr . Tophet . Can you spare him ? Out of the frying ' pan , huh , fellas ? What ? You joining the team ? Captain thought I 'd be useful , Seeing as you 're all playing in my backyard . And before the plague , The fufu cantina , that was the place , boy . Old juan carlo , he made the best mimosas locas . We got to get some of that . God help us . Suppose there 's no way to convince you not to go ? Konstantin ruskov 's a military genius . Literally wrote the book on modern naval warfare . Maybe you can ask him to sign your copy . Seriously , captain , there 's only one way out of this harbor . Every minute we sit here gives that asshole time to dig in . He 's already dug in . Meeting him is the only way . I need to look him in the eyes . Smith , berchem , establish the perimeter . Masks up . You needn 't bother with the masks . We 're not infected . Well , we 'll test you just the same . I 'm unarmed . Make a fist . How can you wear those costumes in this heat ? Still , better than the arctic , no ? Chandler : The arctic was bad for both of us , admiral . As I recall , you lost five airships . Helicopters are easy to replace . Look around you . The world is ours for the taking . He 's clean . You see ? Clean . Jeter : X.O. , take a look . Slattery : They 're mining the bay . We could scare ' em off with the .50-cals. No . Can 't risk a fire fight with the c.O. Off the bridge . T.A.O. , bridge . Get the hunter in the water . Find me a clear route out of this harbor . And spin tomahawks one through six . If I don 't hear from the captain in one hour , We 're unloading on that russian son of a bitch . Mines . I hate freakin ' mines . I told moscow it was suicide . And that we must remain at sea . If we are to survive this plague , But they insisted ... " all ships must return to home ports . " And so I took matters into my own hands . You are looking at the last admiral . Of the last ship of the once great russian navy . So the uniform we wear matters no more . Well , it matters to me . Whether mine is one of a dozen . Or the last ship to survive , We 're all sailors of the United States navy . Of course you are . Still , that we are here is cause to rejoice , no ? You got a funny way of celebrating , admiral ... Firing a nuclear weapon at France . How many people do you think you killed ... 5 , 10 million ? France was already dead . That missile was meant to stop you , To keep you from refueling and sneaking home . With the vaccine in your pocket . We have no interest in keeping the vaccine to ourselves . It 's for the world . Do you know what was going on in the world . While you were playing your war games in the arctic ? The virus spread like an invisible fire , Destroying everything in its path . Bodies piled up sky-high . The fear spread even quicker than the virus itself ... Turned country against country , Brother against brother , Governments against their own people . 60 million chinese were murdered in three days . Like they were culling so many piglets . The world ... Is not worth saving . So , what ? You want to keep the vaccine for yourself ? What I want is of no concern to you . Well , I don 't have it . Not yet , at least . And you won 't , Because you are missing an ingredient only I possess . Now , you will give me what you have ... The primordial sample , Your research , and dr . Scott . Or you die in cuba . You won 't fire on my ship . As long as we have what you want . And this little game of chicken you 're playing right now . Will only cause millions more to die . So why don 't I lead with my best offer ? A sample of the primordial virus . With my compliments . I 'm sorry . That will not do , not at all . Tex : You heard the captain , boris . You ain 't getting our scientist . Don 't be foolish , captain . You cannot win . I 'll go . I 'll go with them . I can do what 's needed . I 'm capable ... No ! Not him . Dr. Rachel scott . She is the one I want . Well , that 's not gonna happen . I can outlast you and your band of cowboys . My ship has enough nuclear fuel to patrol this harbor . For the next 25 years . Then you get nothing , admiral . And while you 're sitting out there , You can wonder , " how am I gonna feed my men . When the americans have all the food on the island ? " Viktor . Aah ! One mouth less to feed . Gator : Rms picked up over a dozen mines . Blocking the only channel out of here . We can kill the ones we need , But not without making a lot of noise . You were right . Ruskov was using the extra time to strengthen his position . Well , it 's not like we could just sneak out of the harbor . Even under cover of night , We 're glowing big and bright on his radar . We 've got the world 's best fighting machine . And an entire naval base at our disposal . Gator , find us a way out of here . Lieutenant green , I want a tactical plan . Work with tex . He 's not navy , but he knows the island and he can fight . We need all hands . Yes , sir . Doctor , admiral ruskov said he had something you don 't , Something you can 't make the vaccine without . Any idea what he was talking about ? He 's bluffing . So , what would you like me to do now ? Well , you said you were close to a breakthrough on the vaccine . Keep working . That 's all that matters . Jeter : We 're at g.Q. , and the russians are having a party . They must still keep vodka on their ships . You know , I wasn 't even supposed to be on this ship . I was two days from reporting to shore duty in portsmouth . And some last-minute change of orders put me on nathan james . I guess that makes you lucky , huh ? Gator : I think I found a way out of here . Navy used to send frigates through this canal all the time . Yeah , they stopped dredging that a while back . From what I heard , it 's all gunked up with coral and rock . Well , that 's why the russians didn 't bother mining it . It 's too shallow for us to get through . Well , it 's too shallow for a ddg , But I could mount some glms on a rib , Sail through it , sneak up on their 180 , And launch a few h.E. Grenades over their stern . A ship that size , it 's gonna take more than that . Tex , what kind of assets are available at gitmo ? Army 's facility has mortars , vehicle-mounted weapons . I got the keys to the joint . Hell , I can get y 'all a bradley tank . You get us in , we 'll do the rest . Before we do anything , I want that canal scouted . Ruskov 's no fool . He knows we 're gonna be looking . For another way out of this harbor . Aye , sir . If we start here ... this is beautiful . Reminds me of my honeymoon video ... At least the footage I let people see . Too much information . Berchem , it 's probably comments like that . That led to your divorce . Tex , how long to get the guns . From the army to the top of the hill ? A couple hours , cap 'n . Good . It 's not deep , but the canal looks better than we thought . Only real problem is that outcropping , probably coral . It may give us a tight squeeze . Smith : Yeah , we 'll have to blow the coral to get a clean path . Hang on . I 'll take you to the surface . We can blow it , but it 'll make a hell of a boom . Contact ! Berchem : Dive ! Dive ! No . No ! No ! Aah ! Berchem ! Smith ! Berchem , come in ! Berchem ! Berchem , come in . Berchem ! Smith ! Ruskov ! Have you reconsidered my offer ? Look out your window , starboard side . Put ' em in the drink . Slattery : T.A.O. , bridge . One round , ten yards off the bow . T.A.O. , aye . Break , surface . Surface , aye . Killing track 81652 with guns , 10 yard forward offset , one round h-e-p-d . Chandler : Consider that a warning , Which is more than you gave to my men . Next time , I won 't miss . I am disappointed in you , captain . You 're not the leader I imagined . I will sink you . This is an arleigh burke destroyer . It was built to fight . You 'd better know how . C.I.C. , this is your captain . Prepare to fire again on my order . This time , I want a direct hit . Kara : Guns , surface . Cover track 85150 with guns . 5 ... 4 ... Guns , aye . Cover track 85150 . Target acquired . 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... What do you want ? Shut your weapons down . Back out of the harbor and over the horizon . I don 't want to see your ugly-ass ship . Out of my front window . Very well . You have 24 hours to turn over the doctor . If you attempt to leave or are planning . Another brilliant sneak attack , we will see you . 24 hours , captain . C.I.C. , x.O. Cease track . Train mount 5-1 to ready air . We should have blown them out of the water . Soon as they 're over the horizon , Send a search and recovery team for smith and berchem . They 're standing by . This new thermal cycler is a godsend . We 'll absolutely be able to identify the gene . How 's it coming with that centrifuge ? I was worried that the humidity on the isla ... Quincy , what are you doing ? I need you to come with me now . What are you ... just go ! Move ! Why are you doing this ? ! Get down the stairs . Now move ! Quincy , have you gone insane ? What is it that you want ? Getting off this ship . Now shut up ! Quincy , you 'll destroy all the samples ! I said shut up ! Now jump . Quincy ... Rachel , I don 't want to hurt you , But that 's exactly what will happen if you don 't do as I say . Now jump . Man : Hey ! What are you doing ? ! He 's got a gun ! Nobody move ! Nobody move ! Quincy ! Hands up ! Stay back ! Don 't shoot ! Stay back ! Drop your weapon ! Stay back ! Drop the weapon ! Rachel : Don 't shoot him ! Quincy . Okay . Okay . Quincy , no ! If I open this , The virus will kill everybody on the ship ! So put your weapons down and back away ! Look , doctor . I don 't know why you did this , But I know we can talk this through . We solve problems . That 's what we do . Rachel , you have to come with me . It 's you they want . Just you . I 'm not going anywhere . You 're gonna have to kill me , too . Jeter : Put your weapons down . Stay back ! Rachel : Give me the vial , quincy . Rachel , they 're not gonna hurt you . They promised me . So , please ... Please come with me . You 're not gonna kill all these people . It 's not who you are . Give me the vial ? Please . He must have been talking to the russians all along . That 's how they were able to follow us . I mean , he was my partner for almost 10 years . I 'm at a complete loss ! What were his connections to the russians ? I don 't know . I mean , he studied there years ago . He has friends , he has colleagues ... we both do . It doesn 't make sense . I told you , I hadn 't met him , not until yesterday ! So , what were you two , like , facebook friends ? I need to see the captain . My family is in grave danger . Yeah , we 'll get to that . First you 're gonna tell me about your relationship . With the admiral . There is no relationship . There never was a relationship ! Please , my daughter is a prisoner on his ship ! You almost killed my entire crew , So I recommend you start talking . It wasn 't supposed to happen like this . During the hysteria of the outbreak , Governments were pressuring their biologists . To deliberately withhold vital information , Research that could possibly contribute to a vaccine . I disagreed . And I began sharing information with another scientist , Sergei yumanov . Sharing ? You mean leaking . You don 't understand ! While governments bickered amongst themselves , The virus was winning ! I couldn 't let that happen ! Ruskov suggested he had someone or something on his ship . To help him make a vaccine . Is that your friend ? Sergei 's dead . I 'd been communicating with him on the sat phone . Then two weeks before the russians attacked us on the ice , I called sergei , And it was ruskov on the end of the line . He 'd murdered sergei and taken my family ... My daughter and my wife . It was a brit that kept us in the harbor . By pretending to be c.O. Of that u.K. Destroyer . Quite a performance by your wife . Kelly had nothing to do with this . Ruskov is using her to get to me . And , more importantly , rachel . Listen . I did a stupid , stupid thing . Do what you want with me , But please don 't make my family pay for my mistakes . Ruskov will kill them if I don 't do as he says . What exactly was your plan tonight ? I was supposed to take rachel and the samples . To the other side of the beach . There 's a boat I can use to get us to the vyerni . Who am I impersonating at this godforsaken hour , The queen of England ? No , your work is done , duschenka . Now it 's up to your husband , and we will see . See ... What ? If he loves his family as much as you say . I must admit , I have mixed feelings about his success . I 've come to enjoy our time together . Chandler : The russians are expecting quincy . To show up with dr . Scott on the civilian vessel . Some time tonight while there 's no moon . The meeting will go off as planned . With a few important differences . Sir , unless we completely cripple the vyerni , He 'll still have retaliatory capability . By then , we 'll be safely out of the harbor . Smith and berchem didn 't die in vain . They showed us we can make our escape through the old canal . Sir , forgive me , but it 's one thing to send a rhlb through . This is a destroyer . The water 's not deep enough . It 's not possible . Exactly why the russians won 't expect it . At high tide , we 'll have two , three feet clearance . That canal is so narrow , We won 't have any margin for error . And then there 's the coral growth . It 'll rip our hull apart . So we blast ourselves a hole . But , sir , the minute we move the ship , Ruskov will see us on his radar . He 's staring right at us . Chandler : He 's not looking at us . He 's looking at a red dot on a radar screen . On that screen , we could be any ship in this port . Let 's prepare the bridge team . Chandler : Lieutenant foster . We need a female for this mission . You grew up on a farm . Can you still handle a rifle ? Qualified as expert marksman last year . I can knock the nipples off a chicken . From a thousand yards , sir . Okay , you 're on alpha team with rowler . Yes , sir . Sir ? I don 't feel comfortable . Having lieutenant foster on this mission . She 's never seen action like this before . Objection noted , lieutenant . She 's going . Then I 'm riding alpha . Sir , I 've ... I 've already lost two men while standing on the sidelines . Search team couldn 't even recover their bodies . I need to be out there this time . Thank you , sir . Slattery : High tide in exactly 2 hours and 48 minutes . We 're gonna take this ship through the eye of the needle . To avoid russian radar , We 're gonna do it at emcon alpha 1 ... No sonar , no radar . But we 're up to the challenge . Yes , sir ! Let 's get the low-vis watch team on the bow . Man : Sir . Sir , without radar , we 're gonna be awfully close . To that coral in order to hit the mark . We won 't get a second chance . We 'll just have to get it right the first time . Aye , sir . Just keep your head down ! Keeping my head down 's kinda gonna defeat the purpose , Don 't you think ? We 're good to go . Next radio click comes . When they 're 500 yards from impact zone . Chandler : Single up . When the master chief 's back on board , take in all lines . Everyone watch the clock . We 're timing this down to the second . Together : Aye , sir . Last time I navigated by dead reckoning . Was the sailing team at the academy . I 'm more nervous about being blown out of the water . On the bright side , with our radar turned off , We won 't see it coming . All right , miller . Find a spot right here . All right . I don 't mean to sound dim , sir , But how 's a roll of aluminum foil . Supposed to look like a 500-foot destroyer ? It 's all about reflections , my man . The james has low reflectivity , Which makes us hard to pick up on radar . In fact , to the russians , We look just about the same as a few square feet . Of tin foil , pointed in the right direction . Master chief , you about ready ? Yes , sir . On your order . Prepare to go emcon alpha 1 . I say again , all radar and radio transmissions . Go down on my count . 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Now ! Sir , all crew back on board . Lieutenant granderson , all ahead 1 / 3 , 3 knots . Make your course 1-3-5 . Engage prairie masker . Aye , sir . Helmsman , come to course 1-3-5 , All ahead 1 / 3 for 3 knots . Course 1-3-5 , all ahead 1 / 3 for 3 knots . Aye . Time to disappear . St. Nicholas point channel light 2-6-2 . St. Nicholas point channel light 2-6-2 . Corinaso point light 1-9-0 . Woman : Corinaso point light 1-9-0 , aye . Gator , I need a report . Speed over ground 4.6 knots . Course over ground 112 . I hold you at 50 yards right of track , Recommend course 1-0-7 to regain track . Recommended course 1-0-7 , aye . Helmsman come to left to course 1-0-7 . My rudder is left , coming to new course 1-0-7 . What 's our depth , gator ? Four feet clearance beneath the sonar dome . To a rocky bottom . If we 're on track , We should be hearing from them . That 's it . They 're in open water , 500 yards out , 10 knots . Calculated impact in five minutes . Chandler : We don 't blast the coral . Until green and foster have reached their target . We wait until we see their blast . Is that clear ? All : Aye , sir . Ruskov should see them by now . Let 's hope he buys it . He already thinks he 's won . Man : We 're hot ! Here we go . Man : I have the reef visually . At about 800 yards off the port bow . O.O.D , based on a good fix , Holds us at 20 yards left of track . Helmsman , come right five degrees rudder . Right five degrees rudder , aye . T.A.O. , I 'm gonna need to blast that coral . What 's your status ? Torpedo is armed and ready . Firing bearing set . What are you doing ? Just bail ! I got this ! Danny , not yet ! We 're gonna be late ! Speed up ! Alisha : Impact is overdue , sir . Why aren 't we seeing anything ? Where are they ? Hang on . Sir , that canal is too tight to turn around in . I can 't slow down without losing maneuverability . We have to blast that coral , sir , or it 'll tear us apart ! Hang on . You can just bail ! I 'm not going anywhere ! We got to go ! Come on . Come on . We 're gonna hit the coral in 15 seconds . Hang on . Admiral ? Alisha : 10 seconds , sir . Come on . Chyort ! Aah ! Fire torpedos ! D.C. Central , captain . Damage report . Man : Bridge , d.C. Central . Initial report ... No apparent hull damage . O.O.D. , let 's pick up our cargo and get the hell out of here . Aye , sir . All engines ahead 2 / 3 . Man : Rescue boat moving to extract . Nice work , lieutenant . Danny . We were late . I could have blown the whole mission . And gotten all of us killed , the whole crew . But you didn 't . And we got out fine . I lost my focus because of you . Because of me ? I didn 't do anything . You throttled down and wanted me to bail . No . Danny . This is ... this is why we 're not supposed to ... I love you . Just stay away from me . Did ruskov have a backup plan ? In case you couldn 't get dr . Scott off the ship ? I haven 't the faintest idea . So , that 's it , then ? They 're dead . You killed my family . No , you killed your family ! You killed them , and two of my best men . The minute you took up with ruskov ! I had no choice ! You always have a choice ! You could have asked for help ! Instead , you took the fate of the entire world . In your hands , and you almost threw it away ! And what would you have done ? If it were your family on ruskov 's ship , What would you have done ? ! Answer me ! What would you have done ? ! Niels : This is ridiculous . Come on . I can 't belive this . Ah , damn it ! Damn it ! Elva ! Elva , this is ridiculous . You didn 't get her , did you ? No . I thought we were all dead . How bad is the ship ? We 'll fix it . Yeah , well I mean , I need that woman , and I need the primordial . We 'll get her and the virus , I assure you . No . Damn it ! Do I need to send someone in . To help you ... Clean up ? No , please . I 'll do it . Ah ! I hate how your men look at me . Like I 'm some sort of circus attraction . Oh , I 'm still waiting on that microwave oven ! I need mice !

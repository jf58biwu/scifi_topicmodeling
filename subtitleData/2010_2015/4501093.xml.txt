 My , my , such a dusty little island . Bub , you 've really got the worst timing . I don 't have time to play with you . And I can see that you 're already ragged from yet another battle . If I crossed blades with you while you were exhausted , Wolverine ... Even if I won , I could not truly claim victory . That part of your samurai code ? Either way , I 'm in a hurry . Although ... I don 't think your path will be as unfettered as you would like . What ? We meet again , Logan . Kurohagi ! Kurohagi 's son ! To run into you again ... I almost admire your tenacity . It ain 't like I wanted to see your ugly mug again ... I came here to give this back to you ! As always , you 're one sneaky little dirtbag . Kikyo ... Master Shingen , or rather my father-in-law , hired you to do a job . So , how about you get to work ? It appears that you 've secured the services of another assassin ... Due to that , I will have to abstain from this confrontation . Another assassin — ? You talk too much ... Cripes , you again — ? The Vadhaka statue ? ! So you 've been hanging out here the whole time , while I 've been running myself ragged ? You 'll find Vadhaka to be upgraded from when you previously fought him ... And since I don 't remember inviting you all to my wedding , you 'll have to leave . Master Koh ! Kurohagi ! Hold it ! You 're wide open , bub ! I see . Maybe this will be a little different ... Wolverine ! Die ! Logan ! Die ! Another earthquake ? ! They 've been non-stop ! Are we going to be alright ? ! Everyone , please calm down ! The ceremony will proceed as planned ! Logan ... Logan ! How 'd you get even stronger ! ? If I gotta smash this thing to get to Mariko , then I 'll do whatever it takes to tear it apart ! Logan ! Master Koh ! Hey ! Get to work ! We 're so terribly sorry ! Master Kurohagi ! Dammit ! Master Koh ! Are you injured ? Can you stand ? Master Koh ! Vadhaka ! What are you doing ? ! You need to eliminate Logan ! Vadhaka ! Kurohagi ! Koh ? ! Yes , sir ? Do not let anyone into the Dragon Palace ! Slaughter anyone that tries to get in ! Yes sir ! Master Koh ! Min ! Don 't ! Hang in there ! I have no fondness for firearms . And to aim them at the unarmed ... I cannot abide that ! Kikyo ! Kikyo ? It 's gonna take a whole lot more than that , to bury me , bub . Kurohagi ! Wolverine ! Kill ! You 're pretty tough too , huh ? Vadhaka ! Wipe them all out ! Master Koh ! Logan ! Master Koh ! Vadhaka , you can 't ! You can 't ! Min , don 't do it ! Do it , Vadhaka ! Stop ! Min ! Son of a bitch ... Wolverine ! Kikyo ? ! This is not assistance ... It does not matter if your mind is artificial ... To raise your hands against a powerless young girl , offends my sense of honor ! I don 't really go in for all that philosophy crap ... But I guess you 're not all bad after all ! Appreciate the help ! Dammit ! Vadhaka has been powered-up by A.I.M. The two of you working together will make no difference ! M ... Master Koh ... Min ... K ... Kurohagi ... you have to ... I know . Min ! I get the feeling ... that if I hadn 't left ... The same thing would have happened to me ... a long time ago . The blade wind ? ! What ? It has no effect ? Even Kikyo 's blade wind didn 't scratch it ... Vadhaka ! I 've been butting heads with A.I.M. for a long time , and they 're pretty good at what they do , but their stuff ain 't perfect ! I know you 're no exception ! Indeed . I have never encountered anything my sword could not cut ... And this thing is no exception . Not armoring the inside of your mouth just shows what a buncha slackers they are ... Now turn to dust , and maybe this time be a proper guardian for this island . Amen . Logan is here ! He 's made it all the way into the Dragon Palace ! I have unfinished business . It has been a long time , Koh . Kurohagi Hideki , and Yashida Mariko ! I 'll kill you , and avenge my parents ! I 've come for you ! Logan ! Next time on Wolverine ... Kurohagi .

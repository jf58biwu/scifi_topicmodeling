 Thing is , no one exactly knows what happened to the crying man that summer . Some say that he drowned in the lake , but others say that they 've seen his ghost , wandering these woods , in search for his lost sister . Actually , they say if you 're quiet and listen real hard ... you can still hear him crying . Mr. Cross , that was , like , the worst crying man ever . Really ? I thought it was pretty good . You guys think we 're kidding . Just remember to stick close to the campfire tonight , okay ? Hey , guys . Do you hear that ? - Hear what ? - That humming sound . Stay here . I 'm gonna take a look around the campground . - What humming ? - W-where 's Mr. Cross going ? He 's just trying to scare us . So lame . Come on , guys . Grab a s 'more . Well , that 's for you . - Ooh , I want the marsh ... - Ooh , marshmallows ! Now , I know ... Tommy , I know you like chocolates . Here . Don 't hog the marshmallows , okay ? Mm-hmm . Everyone to the truck now ! Go , go ! Go ! Mr. Cross ? Mr. Cross ! Come on , guys . Let 's go look for him . - Whoa . - Is he nuts ? Stay close . Mr. Cross , are you okay ? - Mr. Cross ! - We should just go back . Ohh ! 1x06 - F.Z.Z.T. Working up a good sweat there , sir ? I don 't sweat . I glisten . Blood pressure , heart rate , biochems ... all normal . All that 's left is the blood sample . You should know ... I 'm not a fan of getting poked . Tell me , sir ... have you been feeling under the weather lately ? - Why ? - I just noticed from your chart that you 're not due for a general physical for another three months . I made a mistake ... took a call from my physical therapist . Asked how I was feeling . I said , " a little rusty . " Next thing you know , I 'm wired to this hamster wheel . Well , you can officially tell your physical therapist that you 're fit as the proverbial fiddle , - especially for a man of your age . - A man of my age ? That 's something you say to an old person . Is it ? Well , let 's get you some electrolytes , shall we ? Huh . Sorry , Fitz . It 's close , but it 's just not right . Really ? 'Cause agent Coulson had no problems . - It 's an ounce too heavy . - An ounce ? Seriously ? It 's the difference between success and failure . When you 're on a rooftop with a 15-mile-an-hour wind , - your target is 500 yards away ... - Yeah , but we do have a rifle . - Lose the ounce . - Yeah , okay . On it . " Lose the ounce . " I 'm Agent Grant Ward , and I can shoot the legs off a flea from 500 yards , as long as it 's not windy . Hey . That 's a sound I haven 't heard in a bit . Yeah , well , you wouldn 't be laughing a whole lot if you were living in Ward 's doghouse . You made the rounds , apologized to us all . What more can he ask ? - I don 't know . - Mm . I have been busting my ass , memorizing every S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol manual , following every order . " Yes , sir . " " No , sir . " I even let them tag me like a stray dog . I mean , I know I lied to you guys , but I was trying to protect my boyfriend . You know , we all make mistakes . And who ca ... I don 't care ... who cares about your ex-boyfriend ? It 's not like I 'm comparing Ward to Miles , but at least with Miles , I didn 't have to worry about - passive-aggressive stuff . - That 's not it ... - There was no mind games . - Mm . We spoke the same language , you know ? - Yeah . Yeah , a bit like we do . - Totally . You and Simmons are so tight , it 's like you 're psychically linked . No , you ... no . Actually , no . I don 't think so . So , Ward was here ? Let me guess ... the night-night pistol again ? Yeah . Oh , yeah , and he said it was off by an ounce . Of course he did . I 'm Agent Grant Ward , and I could rupture your spleen with my left pinky ... blindfolded ! That is dead on . Hey . Hustle up and grab your gear . We 're on a mission . Something funny ? Poor , silly Fitz . He mistakenly left a dummy round in the pistol . Should be proper now . Great . Thanks . Troop leader 's name was Adam Cross . Apparently , he said he heard something in the woods , went to check it out . That 's where the electrostatic anomaly occurred . What I don 't understand is , usually , they 're caused by a massive electrical storm ... But there wasn 't a storm within a thousand miles - of here last night . - This anomaly 's different ... it has a side effect we 've never seen before . The battery blew straight up through the hood . Landed over here . Hell of a force to create that kind of trajectory . Huh . What are you doing ? I 'm shadowing my supervising officer . Shadowing , not smothering . There 's scorch marks all over that tree . Lucky the whole forest didn 't burn down . I don 't get it . Seems to me like this electroshock thingy was some freak lightning strike . I mean , why call us ? What 's the big ... Oh . Never mind . So sad a man died this way ... and yet , so amazing . Fitz-Simmons , any idea what could cause an effect like this ? - There 's the soliton hypothesis . - Well , okay , judging by the horizontal ... - Perhaps , nanobatteries ... - ... electrical discharge , it could be ... Time . Let 's try that again . Any idea what could cause an effect like this ? - The hell if I know . - Uh , no , no clue . Seems to me like we 're either dealing with some freak natural event or a new high-tech weapon . Or could it be someone from your uber-secret index ? There 's no one on the index with this type of power . That we know of . I 'll contact agent Blake at S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ , have him check it out . Whoever or whatever 's responsible , - we can 't let this happen again . - Fitz , see his forehead ? Look at that endothelial discoloration . Yeah , same dispersal pattern as the strike on the truck . Could be an entry wound cauterized immediately . Freaky . Freaaaky . You found something on Cross ? Many things , actually , but you already knew that , thanks to my fancy S.H.I.E.L.D. house-arrest gizmo tracking my every key swipe , my online activity , my cholesterol . Just wish it came in another color ... or came off . - The victim ? - Adam Cross ... single , no kids , originally from Wrigley , Pennsylvania , not far from here . Been there . They have a nice little strawberry festival in the spring . Occupation ? Phys-ed teacher at the local high school and Varsity baseball coach and troop leader and volunteer firefighter . This guy makes Captain America look like " the dude . " " The Big Lebowski . " Seriously ? What about a criminal record , restraining order , something that might give us a suspect ? Nada ... not even a parking ticket . I skimmed all his posts , anyone linked to his pages , hoping for a crazy ex or superpowered stalker , and he 's clean . Everybody looks clean on their first go-round . Ward 's right . We 're missing something . Dig deeper . - You 've been pretty tough on her . - She lied to us ... contacted the Rising Tide while we were on mission . If she wants our trust back , she 's got to earn it . The background she ran on Cross is a good start . Put it up on the server . I want may to have a look when she 's done with her interrogation . Have a cookie . Excellent timing , sir . I 've been analyzing sagittal and coronal images of the victim 's brain . What 's Fitz doing out there ? He detected a strange energy coming off the body . He 's afraid of it , isn 't he ? - It 's the smell ! - There 's no shame in it , Fitz . It 's perfectly natural to be afraid . No , the only thing I 'm afraid of is putrid , decaying flesh corrupting my pristine workspace . Do you remember the last time you brought a dead thing into the lab ? Oh , not the stupid cat again . - The cat ... - And it 's our lab , Fitz . - ... tell him about the cat ! - Not your lab . You left his liver next to my lunch ! - Guys ! Can we please ... - Yes , sir . Um , as I was saying , this is the victim 's brain . Looks like a burnt baked potato . That 's what happens when it 's hit with close to 2,000 megajoules of electrostatic energy . That 's almost double the power of a lightning bolt . Kid 's clean . You figure out why the body was floating ? Not yet . The molecular density of the victim was temporarily altered by an unknown energy source . I 'm hoping to shed some light on its effects once I extract a brain-tissue sample . - It 's happening again ! - It 's science , Fitz ! I have to dissect something . No , the satellite 's picking up another electrostatic event not 20 kilometers from here . Fitz , what 's the latest reading ? We 're at 324 megajoules and growing stronger ... dangerous territory , sir . There 's a farmhouse a mile North of you , right at the center of the signal . That 's got to be it . Skye , dig up everything you can on whoever lives at that farm . We need to know who we 're dealing with . Hold on , now . What just happened ? Um , it 's gone . - What 's gone ? - The electrostatic signal ... it seemed to pulse , then disappear . We need a shortcut . - Door 's barred from the inside . - Hayloft 's open . We could ram it with the truck . Or ... Scan the perimeter . Whoever did this couldn 't have gotten far . Barricaded himself inside . Went for his shotgun . He was scared , trying to protect himself . From who ? How did they get to him ? Another burn mark on the forehead . No sign of anyone ... no tracks , no vehicles down the road . Skye , we need real-time SAT surveillance on this area right now . Hang on . I think I found something you might want to see first . Sending it over now . The guy who owns the farm 's name is Frank Whalen . He 's a volunteer firefighter at the same station house as our first victim , Adam Cross . Our two victims knew each other . They were both responders when the aliens crashed New York . Two victims from the same firehouse found in the same weird way . We 're looking for a killer . Gotcha ! Hey , um , anyone else notice all the metal scattered around the body , like an electromagnetic field was present ? The question is , what created it ? We need to get this body back to the lab as soon as possible . Something about these wounds ... Skye , what did you find out about the firehouse ? It turns out they sent an engine to New York with a dozen volunteers after the Chitauri invasion , including Cross and Whalen . Maybe it has something to do with why they were targeted ? Or how they were killed . - You mean like ... an alien weapon ? - We don 't know that . Let 's just make sure we get to those firefighters before anyone else does . Evening , gentlemen . Agent Phil Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. we were on the ground with you in New York . S.H.I.E.L.D. , right . What 's this all about ? We 'd like to ask you a few questions , take a look around . Hey , guys . What 's , uh ... what 's going on ? What are you looking for ? - A scented candle . - Not you . This wound ... something doesn 't quite make sense . Initially , I thought these were entry wounds , as if from a gunshot . But they 're not ... they 're exit wounds . What do you mean ? Frankie 's dead ? - I 'm very sorry . - You know how it happened ? The same way your other friend , Mr. Cross , died the day before . Which was how , exactly ? - I 'm sorry . Your name is ... ? - Tony . Tony Diaz . - You okay , Mr. Diaz ? - Actually , uh ... I 'm actually not feeling so hot . Ward , cover the back door . Nobody comes in or out . What if this weapon overloaded the brain past the threshold of its electrical capacity , causing it to discharge , like an E.M.P. ? You 're assuming we 're dealing with an external source . I 'm saying it was something from inside him . Something 's happening ... the satellite 's picking up another reading . It 's coming from the firehouse . That humming noise ... you hear that ? No . I don 't . Were you in New York with Mr. Cross and Mr. Whalen after the Chitauri invasion ? Come on . You don 't hear that ? - It 's driving me nuts . - Mr. Diaz , are you with me ? - Whatever you 're doing , make it stop . - I-I 'm not doing anything ! - Where 's the weapon ? - The what ? Coulson , I found it . It 's a Chitauri helmet . Fitz-Simmons , are you seeing this ? It 's not a weapon , yet it caused a cranial discharge . What are you doing with the helmet ? What , the ... the alien thing ? I-it 's a souvenir . - Not again ! - Answer the question , Mr. Diaz ... what are you doing with the helmet ? The first time anyone 's touched it since New York - was a couple nights ago . - Why ? It had rust all over it . We were cleaning it . That wasn 't rust . May , don 't touch it ! Sir , he 's not using a weapon ... he 's infected . I think the helmet was the source of an alien virus . All we did was clean it ... I swear . Me , Frankie , and Adam ... we ... we were bored on the third shift , so ... so we decided to clean it . Adam and Frankie ... Mr. Diaz , I 'm putting the gun away now , okay ? Sir , he 's at 600 megajoules and climbing . Sir ? Clear everybody out . Clear everybody out ... now ! I-I 'm gonna wind up like them , aren 't I ? Why don 't you have a seat ? You have any family ... wife , kids ? Is there anyone you want to talk to ? Anything I can do ? Sir , you have to get out of there right now ! He 's going to ... Listen to me . I 've been where you are right now . So please believe me when I tell you you don 't have to be afraid . What are you ... what are you talking about ? Your job ... gets pretty dangerous , doesn 't it ? Mine , too . I got hurt once ... pretty bad . And I ... I died . Some say it was only for 8 seconds , but I know it was more than that . I know I wasn 't here anymore . I was there . What 's it like ? It 's beautiful . You better get going , buddy . Go . All clean ... no traces of electrostatic energy . What about the other firefighters ? They 'll be quarantined and observed at a S.H.I.E.L.D. biohazard facility . Um , anyone else notice they 're putting the infected alien thing on our truck ? - We 're flying it to the Sandbox . - Sandbox ? It 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility across the Atlantic . They specialize in hazardous materials . If what you suspect is true , that this is a virus , then those firefighters could be infected , and they 're gonna need a cure . - Find one . - Yes , sir . - What 's our E.T.A. ? - 3 : 37 West Africa time . Gonna be a long 4 hours and 26 minutes . You okay ? Fine . I just want this alien thing off our plane as soon as humanly possible . - You want to talk about your physical ? - Nothing to tell . My physical therapist requested it . He 's updating his files or something . You 'd tell me if something was wrong . Of course . Sir , I think I 've discovered something . Could you come down to the lab ? - I 'll be right there . - Phil . The fireman ... you did everything you could for him . So , what am I looking for exactly ? Wait for it . - What was that ? - A groundbreaking discovery ! I believe the firefighters initially contracted the virus when they cleaned the helmet , the friction activating some long-decaying Chitauri organism ... Hang on . These cells are from the bodies of the firefighters ? Brain cells , yes ... the last vestiges of the infection . Some viruses " sleep " inside host cells for years before reproducing , as they did inside the helmet ... the initial source . But what those cells tell us is that we 're dealing with a propagating virus , which means ... The virus can move from person to person . Exactly ! And that 's the most exciting part ... how it spreads ... not through the air or through direct fluid transfer , but through electric static shock . It 's like nothing we 've ever seen on Earth . I didn 't think it possible a virus could alter its host 's molecular density and polarity . That explains the floating . I can 't wait till the virologists at the CDC and S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ see this . Sir , is something wrong ? I 'm so sorry , Jemma . Oh , no . Simmons believes she contracted the virus approximately 36 hours ago when she received an electrostatic shock from the first victim . How much time does she have ? Based on when the firemen were infected , how quickly their symptoms manifested ... two hours at most . That 's enough time , right ? I mean , S.H.I.E.L.D. has dozens of labs and scientists working on this thing , don 't they ? They do . How soon can you get us on the ground ? Three hours . Our path to the Sandbox has us right in the middle of the Atlantic . Sir , correct me if I 'm wrong , but if we can 't land in time ... Simmons will release a pulse that will blow this plane right out of the sky . We can 't just sit here and watch her die . - We have to do something . - There 's only one person on this plane capable of finding a solution for this , and I 'm willing to bet my life that she will . She 's just a kid . I believe we have a winner . Fast and efficient ... the perfect delivery mechanism . Uh , hey , um , not that it was easy to find a mineralized solution that could suspend the vaccine and conduct electricity . I wish you wouldn 't use the word " vaccine . " It 's really more of an antiserum . Okay , so ... these antibodies should be able to target the virus ' antigens , if this bloody alien virus even has antigens . Come on , now . Come on . Well ... that wasn 't very cooperative of him , now , was it ? Why aren 't you down there ? They don 't need an audience . You can stay ... if you want . I hate this . I just feel so ... - Helpless . - Yeah . I wanted it to be a person , some superpowered psychopath ... someone I could hurt , someone I could ... punish . That I could do . What I can 't do is protect you guys from stuff I can 't even see ... or understand . So , what do we do ? We wait ... - ... and get ready . - Ready for what ? For whatever it is we 're called upon to do . Coulson , nice to see you 're not dead . Did you get our analysis of the virus ? We did , and S.H.I.E.L.D. has no record of anything like it . No one does . So it 's imperative it reach the Sandbox without incident . In case of a pandemic , we 're going to need it . I 'm aware of that , but I don 't need more orders or ultimatums . I need answers . I wish I had some for you . I 'm sorry , Coulson ... I 've been ordered to inform you that if you have infected cargo , you need to dump it . Do you copy me , Coulson ? These orders are coming from up top . I 'm sorry ... bad connection . Didn 't get that last part . Don 't even think it . I don 't have to . That 's your job . It 's all right . Everything 's gonna be fine . Please stop saying that . I see you looking at your watch . Are you sure you don 't need my help just to ... Are you sure this thing even works ? Yeah , well , you know it does . My device isn 't the issue ... it 's the vaccine . Antiserum ! And all I 'm wondering is whether you calibrated it correctly . Hey , it 's not the device . Hey , don 't put this on me . I was doing just fine , tucked away in a safe , indoor , non-mobile lab at the academy ! - Oh ! - Then you had to go and drag us into this flying circus ! Didn 't even pass our field assessments , for god 's sake ! Oh , please , as if I forced you to follow me anywhere . You said , and I quote ... " Oh , Fitz , it 's the most perfect opportunity " for us to see the world ! We 'd be fools to pass this one up ! " I hate it when you use that voice . That 's not even how I sound . And you were just afraid of going into the field . I was not afraid . And don 't you dare act like these last months haven 't been the highlight of your entire pasty life ! Pasty ? Oh , really ? Well , when did you become so sun-kissed ? Because I 'm pretty sure that every minute of every day , you 've been stuck in a lab right beside me . At the academy , at sci-ops , this plane ... you 've been beside me the whole damn time ! - You have to fix this . - I don 't know how , Fitz . The antibodies from the three firefighters aren 't strong enough to fight this virus . It 's born from alien DNA . There 's no one ... to create an antiserum from because no one 's actually survived this except ... - the Chitauri . - The Chitauri . Well , the minky bastard who actually wore the helmet - had the virus ... - Yeah , and managed to survive without ever emitting an electrostatic pulse because ... - It was immune . - Yes ! She ... she was just the carrier , like Typhoid Mary . Uh , " she " ? Well , no , wait . That ... you don 't really think that ... okay , doesn 't matter . Um , so if ... if I can scrape some epithelial cells from the inside of the helmet , we can create a vaccine ? Yes ! Antiserum , but yes . - Isn 't that ... - Fitz ! No , uh ... you can 't be in here ! Too late . It 's done . Just try and do your best to keep your hands off me , yeah ? Fitz , I don 't know what you think you 're doing , but ... I 'm doing what we always do . We 're gonna fix this ... together . Third time 's a charm . May I do the honors ? I can 't breathe . We did it . No ... Sir , I know the protocol in these circumstances , but could you please tell my dad first ? I just think my Mum would take it better if it comes from him . We 're not there yet . There 's still time . Sir , please . Would you mind if I had a brief moment alone with Fitz ? Come on . Let 's go . We 'll try again . The electrostatic pulse from the third rat seemed much less , so we 're making progress . If we can calibrate the antiserum ... Antiserum , yes . You finally got it right , Fitz . I 'm so sorry . Agent Blake is on the line . He wants to know what 's going on . If you won 't answer , he asked for Ward . Sir ... what are our orders ? They 're unchanged . What is that ? Someone 's lowering the cargo-hold ramp . Hey . It worked . The pulse just knocked the rat uncon ... scious . Jemma ? Jemma ! Jemma , it worked ! Please , don 't ! Nooo ! Jemma , nooo ! Jemma ! Jemma ! Must have to find Jemma ... The antiserum worked , but she jumped ! Don 't get me wrong ! I 'm happy you 're both alive ... truly . And I realize you were trying to save the team , but what you did today ... that was not your call . Just getting you out of the water ... do you have any idea what a pain it is dealing with the Moroccan office ? Don 't you ever pull a stunt like that again ! We 'd hate to lose you , Jemma . Thank you , sir . Oh , does that mean we 're to leave now ? So , what did you think of your first time skydiving ? Honestly , I 'd rather not think about it anymore . I thought what you did was incredibly brave . Oh . Well , I-I suppose now 's as good a time as any to tell you that , um ... I may have misled you earlier . You see , when I gave you back the night-night pistol , I lied ... it 's still an ounce off . - I know . - You do ? Of course . After all ... I 'm Agent Grant Ward . I just jumped out of a plane without a parachute on - and saved your life ! - Actually , that 's not quite it . It 's a bit more nasally than that . Oh . Hello , Skye . Ohh ! How was Simmons ? Amazingly resilient . You 'd never know she almost died . Experience like that ... it takes awhile to sink in . That her medical report ? Mine , actually . Blood work finally came back . I 'm perfectly normal ... little heavy on the iron . But don 't worry ... you don 't have to start calling me " Iron Man . " Wasn 't planning on it . My doctors never requested any tests . I ordered them for myself , but you knew that . This piece ... of paper is telling me that everything 's fine , but ... I don 't feel fine . I feel different . - Take off your shirt . - Excuse me ? Your shirt ... unbutton it . Whether it was 8 seconds or 40 , you died . There 's no way you can go through a trauma like that and not come out of it changed . - You know how long it 's taken me to ... - I know . The point of these things is to remind us that ... there is no going back ... there 's only moving forward . You feel different ... because you are different . - And I was going to do it . - I know you were . I had the antiserum , the chute ... everything . - I just couldn 't get the straps on . - Fitz , please . And , you know , maybe I couldn 't have done - the whole " James Bond - Fitz , shut up . - in midair " type of thing . - Please , just ... Ward did an amazing thing , yes , but it wasn 't Ward by my side in that lab , searching for a cure . It wasn 't Ward giving me hope when I had none . - It was you . - Hmm . - You 're the hero . - Yeah ? Yeah . Thank you . - Blake . - Coulson . That 's the best you could come up with ... " we 've got a bad connection " ? - I was pressed for time . - It 's a bold move . You know our chat wasn 't exactly private . - They never are . - I don 't know what happened to you in New York , if you really flatlined or if that 's just what they tell us when we reach level seven , but whatever did happen doesn 't give you license to disobey a direct order from HQ . You keep pulling stunts like that , someone might decide to take this little dream team away from you . I 'd like to see them try . That doesn 't sound like the Phil Coulson I used to know . No , I suppose it doesn 't . Get used to it .

 - Hey , Dad . - Hey , Buddy . - What 's in the bag ? - Uh-uh . What is it ? Come on . What 's in the bag ? - No way . Where 'd you get it ? Get what ? - Dad scored an orange . - No . From where ? I can 't even remember the last time I saw one of those . Hey , look , Zoe . - Hey , Zoe . I can peel it for her . - Hi . How was your day ? - Hi . Missed you . How was yours ? Not great actually . Three more patients with pulmo-replasia . One was a seven-year-old boy , he could hardly breathe on his own . It 's getting worse and worse out there . Even a rebreather isn 't enough anymore . You got a little on your nose . Cool , huh ? Juice . They 're coming . I was downstairs and I saw them . They 're on their way now . Zoe , baby , it 's time to play hideaway , okay ? Come on . Climb in there for Mommy . Okay . Everything 's going to be okay . Okay . I love you . Population Control . You 're being investigated for a possible violation . Oh , no . There , there must be some mistake . I 'm a cop , too . Hey . I need you to step outside so we can search the premises . Okay . Let 's go . Come on , guys . It 's okay . Hey ! Be careful with that ! No . Hold it ! Mommy ? Mommy ? Come on . Come here . I 'm not playing around . Come on . Leave her alone ! Don 't touch her ! - Jim ! - Dad ! Dad ! Mommy ! Stay back ! Mom ! Stop it ! Stop ! Stop it ! See , now you shouldn 't have done that , pal . Shannon . You paid for five minutes . Oh , my God , Jim . - Elisabeth . - Jim . Hey . Look at you . Who are they , just prisoners , so there 's no need to filter the air , is that it ? Don 't worry about me . I 'm holding on okay . What are you doing here ? Are the kids all right ? Yeah , they 're good . But , Jim ... I 've been contacted by the recruitment people for Terra Nova . Terra Nova ? That 's incredible news . When ? The Tenth Pilgrimage is scheduled to leave next week . Oh , my God , Liz , you gotta go . You gotta take the kids , and you gotta go . Jim . It 's a chance at a new life . Don 't pass it up ... No , you don 't understand . They 're not gonna let me take Zoe . Why ? They said we can 't be rewarded for breaking the law . So it 's me and Maddy and Josh , or it 's nothing . No . There 's gotta be some way around this . There is . Time 's up . Someone 's coming . Okay . Jim , I 'm counting on you . We need to go , now ! - Okay . Just let me give him this , okay ? Please . It 's the air . It 's killing him . Fine . Take that , take care of yourself , okay . Okay ? Terra Nova , the New World , Terra Nova , the New World , a name everyone , everywhere , has come to know as a symbol of hope . Twenty-two years have passed since scientists first realized that some of their experiments uncovered an unexpected phenomenon . Physicists characterized this anomaly as a fracture in the fabric of time and space . - You said he 'd be on this train . - He 'll be here , Maddy . Just keep your voice down . I got it all planned out . Don 't worry . Yeah . Step one : Dad breaks out of a maximum security facility . Step two : Dad breaks into a maximum security facility . Piece of cake . Next in line , please . - Doctor Elisabeth Shannon . Transferring with two children ? That 's right . The latest word on the departure is that the Tenth Pilgrimage will depart for Terra Nova in just an hour from now ... This will raise the total number of colonists to Terra Nova to ... Okay . Next in line , please . - Thank you . If you are wearing a red security badge , please report to the departure platform . If you are wearing a red security badge , please report to the departure platform . I love you . I miss you already . I 'm gonna figure out a way to get you there . Even if I have to come back here and get you myself . It 's a one way trip , Josh . There 's no way back . Final call has commenced . Please proceed immediately to the departure platform . - Go . Live a wonderful life . - I love you . Please remove your rebreathers and place them in the bins provided . Your rebreathers will not be required . Launch platform is straight down that corridor .

Sir , I need you to step out of line . You were seen leaving a restricted area . Oh , sorry . I took a wrong turn . - Mom . - We have to keep going . If we go in there , we can 't come back . We will be right behind you . Go . Oh , I 've already been through security . I need to check your pack and do a retinal scan . I told you , I 've already been cleared . No , I won 't go without Dad ! - Go with your brother . - Mom . It 's okay , I 'm gonna be right behind you , Maddy . - Dad ? - He 'll find a way . Okay ? He always does . Now , go ! - You go . - I love you . This is ridiculous . You must 've made a mistake . Sir , I need to know why you were in a restricted area . Sir , you 're gonna have to come with me , now .

Put it down ! Check their packs for more weapons . - No ! - No ! No ! You heard right , two stowaways . Adult male and a five-year-old girl . Copy that , Lieutenant Washington . Tell Commander Taylor we 're headed back now . So , how much trouble do you think we 're in ? Well , you were recruited . I mean , they need you too much not to cut you some slack . Me ? You think they 'll make you serve out your time ? Well , I hope not . I 'm not scheduled to be released for another 85 million years . Are those clouds ? Yeah , sweetie . They are . They 're so white . Hey , Zoe , I know I was gone a long time , but you remember me , right ? Allosaur tripped a sonic mine . Just keep moving . - Allosaur , that the carnivorous kind ? - Yup . I hope we 're getting close . Welcome to Terra Nova . Welcome ! Citizens of 2149 . I 'm Commander Nathaniel Taylor . But you probably already know that . Congratulations . Each one of you has taken a first step just as I did seven years ago , toward a new beginning . Together , we are at the dawn of a new civilization . No pressure . The world you left behind fell victim to some of the baser instincts of our species : greed , war , ignorance . We blew it . We destroyed our home . But we have been entrusted with a second chance . A chance to start over . A chance to get it right . Welcome to Terra Nova , folks . Welcome home . Taylor wants to see you , without the children . Okay . - We 'll be right back , sweetheart . - We 'll be right back . Doctor Elisabeth Shannon , first in your class at Northwestern Med . Doctor of Science in Immunology , Bacteriology and a couple of other " ologies " I can 't even pronounce . Two years pro-bono trauma work at " I Help the Poor People General . " - Commander Taylor ... - What I don 't get is , it also says here , that your husband is currently serving a six-year bit at Golad lock-away . And yet , here he is , with a third child in tow . - What am I to make of this ? - Look ... This was all my idea , okay ? Elisabeth didn 't even know . Didn 't she ? A man doesn 't escape from Golad without help from the outside . Um ... They weren 't gonna let us bring Zoe . There was no other choice . Law caps families at two kids . You had a third , you got caught , and you took the fall . The thing is this : I really don 't care about population laws from another time . What I do care about is whether or not an individual is of use to this colony . A doctor , we need . An escaped fugitive , not so much . Commander Taylor , all we 're looking for here is a fresh start . We just want to be a family again . Well , Doctor Shannon , we are pleased to have you here . Lieutenant Washington will show you to your kids . I 'm gonna have a private word with your husband . Now it also says here that you were a cop before you went away . - Narcotics . Chicago PD . - I don 't understand . A man sworn to uphold the law . A woman as accomplished as your wife . And you decide to have a third kid , to risk everything . Why ? It seemed like a good idea at the time . You thought that was a good idea ? That you 'd actually get away with it ? Good grief , son , what were you thinking ? What 's between me and my wife is none of your damn business . Now , are you gonna lock me up or what ? What I ought to do is throw you outside the fence and let you fend for yourself . No , what you ought to do is give me a gun and a badge and let me do what I 'm good at . There must be some bad guys around here that need catching . Agricultural detail is down a man . That 's all . According to my daughter , I have whatever the opposite of a green thumb is . But I 'll do my best . Agricultural duty . You can make that work , right ? It beats making license plates . Your quarters are here in the newer part of the settlement . There 's a PX down that way for supplies . Some of these units aren 't quite finished . I don 't even think yours has been painted yet . Here we are . This is ours ? If you need anything , just let us know . This is it . Come on . I get the room with the most windows . - I get first pick . Says who ? I 'm the oldest . Oh , man ! They gave us the M-7 model . It 's not bad , right ? Throw some paint on the walls . Get a rug or something . Do they have rugs here ? Maybe a nice , sort of , dino-runner would be great down the hallway . I don 't know . Jim ? We did the right thing , didn 't we ? Coming here ? Mommy ? There 's no room for me . We 'll figure something out , sweetie . She doesn 't know me . The last time you saw her , she was barely three . So , we need to find a bed for , oh , what 's your name again ? Oh , that 's right , Martha ? Okay , so , we need ... Oh , oh , right , right , right , Priscilla . Not Priscilla , huh ? Oh , wait . I got it . It 's Zoe . Yeah . Well , hi , Zoe . My name is Alfredo . It 's a pleasure to meet you . What ? No , it 's not . Well , what is it ? Daddy . Okay . So it 's settled . Me and Zoe get this room , seeing as it 's bigger . And , we can squeeze another bed in . - Can I see ? - Yeah . One big happy family . Like nothing ever happened . What 's that supposed to mean ? I guess we 're supposed to just forget about the last years we had to fend for ourselves 'cause Dad was in jail . - Josh ! - That 's enough ! Admit it , Mom . It 's his own damn fault ! If he hadn 't lost his cool and thrown a punch at that cop , he might 've just gotten away with a fine . Have you ever thought about that ? Hey ! We 're not gonna stand here and argue the past with you , okay . We 're starting over , as a family . Zoe ? Has anybody seen Zoe ? Where 'd she go ? - I thought she was with you ? - She was . Zoe ? Zoe ? Zoe . Zoe ! Good night , sweetheart . I 'm really glad you 're home , Dad . Good night . - Good night . - Yep . She got used to sleeping in my room . And it seems we 've run out of beds . Luckily , there 's a couch . Right . The answer 's yes . We did do the right thing , coming here . You 're telling me this is all we can have for the next three days ? Did you not read any of the literature they gave us ? Real food has all these enzymes our bodies aren 't used to yet . And besides , it 's really not that bad . I don 't want to go to orientation . I wanna stay with you . Mommy has a brand-new job she has to go to . And Maddy and Josh are going to go to orientation , so you can go with them , okay . You guys used up all the hot water . Thanks . No . The solar panels can only heat up so much at a time . Blame it on the sun if you want . Agricultural Department , a quarter mile that way , Dad . - Wait , that way ? - And the clinic should be right here . Are you sure ? All right , I better go . That 's ... Okay , have a good time . Okay , now , you , no more wandering off , okay . - Okay , so see you when you 're done . - Yeah . Have fun ! Bye . Okay , so , we should be meeting at the south end . Come on . No way . I can 't believe it ! Can 't believe what ? What is it ? You 've got to be joking . It 's the probe ! You know , the one they sent through when they first discovered the time fracture . - How can you not know that ? - I was having a life , Maddy . No one knew at first how far back the fracture went , or even where it led to . They sent this back with a beacon inside , so that , you know , they could find it . However , many millions of years later , only they never did . Huh ? That 's how they knew that they were dealing with a new time stream . - Whatever , Maddy . - Whatever ? Okay , Josh , you do realize that if we were in the same time stream , then , something like , I don 't know , just stepping on a butterfly could change everything . Like for example , us never being born . Can I scratch my name on it like everybody else 's ? Yeah , go ahead , Zoe . Mark it up . Okay . I 'm out of here . - Where you going ? - To get some real food . I 'm starving . - What about orientation ? - I can explore on my own , Maddy . - Josh ? - Look after Zoe . Let 's keep it simple . Why don 't you give us a hand with some weeding . Weeding ? Yeah . I think I can handle that . Good . You know , this place needs a whole lot of upkeep . I 'll leave you to it . Okay . Whoa ! I 'm okay . I 'm okay . It was just a bug . No worries . Just a bug . Yes ! Thanks . What , this is funny to you ? That 's how you get off , making fun of the new guy trying to eat fruit ? Here , give it to me . Go ahead . Oh ! You get used to it . I promise . Yeah . I 'll take your word for it . Hey , what 's your name ? - Josh . - I 'm Skye . Fifth Pilgrimage . So you 're a recruit or lottery ? My mom was recruited , so we all had to come . Most people count themselves lucky . You left somebody behind , huh ? So , what 's there to do around here , anyway ? Well , depends on how close to the edge you like to walk . Okay , bed one sedated and his wound 's sutured . - Great . Nurse , a hand over here , please . If you get a sec , could you check bed three 's oxygen ? Hi . I 'm Doctor Shannon . Okay . So , you came in complaining of nausea and a headache , right ? The other doctor said I was hyper-oxic . Whatever that means . It means you 're not used to so much fresh air . Can you unhook me , please ? They said it 'll only take a half hour , and it 's been at least that long already . Yeah . I don 't see an IV anywhere . Whoa ! Whoa ? Is that a technical term ? Sorry . Interesting . They must get rid of the excess oxygen from the blood . Can you just get it off me ? Yeah , let me just ... Hang on . There we go . All better . - Josh ? - Dad ? You 're supposed to be at orientation ! What are you doing ? Josh , this is not how you start your first day . Would you excuse my son , please ? There 's somewhere he needs to be . - Let 's go . - Come on . - Hey ! I told you ... - You can 't just come back after all this time and start telling me what to do ! Let 's go . So how bad are things in 2149 ? It 's funny . When it 's the only thing you know , it all seems so normal . But coming here makes you realize how bad things have gotten . I don 't really remember much . I was just a kid when we left . Oh , this is my place here . Hey , guys , This is Josh . He 's new . Welcome to Terra Nova , I 'm Tasha . That 's Hunter . How you doing , fresh ? So far , so good . - So , this is all your guys ' place ? - Yeah . Us and one other , Max . - And your parents ? - Mine live just up that way . Why ? I mean , it 's your own place . Aren 't you only , like , 16 ? So ? I mean , we work . We have jobs . Yeah , this is the frontier . You gotta grow up quick . Yeah , you got the whole , " Taylor welcome speech , " didn 't you ? We 're the new dawn of civilization . How was the office , sweetheart ? - Not bad . We finished another hydro-turbine today . - Who 's the fresh ? - Name is Josh . Max . Glad to meet you . - It 's so hot . Who 's up for a little OTG ? - Yes . On foot ? No way . Well , guess who started repair-dock duty this week ? Great . Okay . We 'll meet you guys in the usual spot , in 20 ? Yeah . OTG on your first day . I mean , that 's gotta be a record . To us . We actually made it . - I had my doubts for a minute there . - Mmm . Wow . So , how 's your day going ? Well , I practiced some neo-medieval medicine . And I tended to a thief . - A thief ? - Mmm . That 's what they told me . Why ? Well , it 's just , why would anyone steal anything here ? Everyone 's pretty much provided for . - Who knows . But , guess what ? - What ? It 's not your problem . You 're not a cop anymore . So , what 's this about Josh skipping orientation ? I don 't know . He just blew it off . I mean , I can 't say I 'm surprised . But ... I know . I can 't say I am either . You know what , we shouldn 't be too hard on him . - He 's been through a lot . - We all have . That doesn 't excuse him getting out of line with me . He really missed you . You know that ? Just give him some time , okay . He 'll come around . I just worry about him , that 's all . He has this knack for finding trouble . - Where we going ? - Stay close . Okay ? You don 't have to come if you don 't want to . Out there ? You 're kidding , right ? The only way to find out is to come with . There . No big deal . You coming or not ? Skye ! Come here . Come on . We were about to leave without you . Yeah , the hell you were , Hunter . Get ready to go OTG , fresh . OTG ? " Outside the gates . " Who 's up for the short cut ? No way , Skye . We 'll meet you there . - Keep up ! - I 'm trying . It 's just a howler . It sounds lot worse than they actually are . What , are you just gonna stand there and watch ? You think that was fun ? You wanna see something really cool ? - Cooler than that ? Sure . - Great , come on . This way . Check it out . Found it when we were exploring . There 's more over there . What is it ? Looks like some kind of geometry or something . I think they 're equations , but I can 't be sure . I can 't make heads or tails of it . Well , who did this ? I don 't know . And why do it on a bunch of rocks ? It doesn 't make any sense . It looks like it 's been here for a while . Did you tell Taylor about this place ? No , we 're not even supposed to be out here . This whole area 's off limits . It 's like Taylor doesn 't want anyone to know about this . Um ... Don 't tell anybody about this , all right ? You promise ? Good . What was he stealing that made it necessary to shoot him ? Him and his buddies were siphoning off our power grid . - Why would they need to do that ? - They 're Sixers . Sixers ? Slide your weapon across the floor . Now ! So , basically , Calysonias is real finicky . So you gotta keep the nitrogen level just so , otherwise the roots get hydroxic . - " Hydroxic " ? - Right . - Right . - So , what you need to do is , you need to stick this into the root of the plant , and then , you need to record it on here . - Okay . - Are , are you listening ? Now , like I was saying , once you get it on there , into the plant , - And then you record it here . - Yeah . Yeah know , I 'm gonna be right back . And , we 're gonna do more stuff with the thing . - Right . - Hydroxic . Hydroxic . Hope Plaza says they wanna put through more than 100 people next time . That 's a lot of housing units and not a lot of time . Suspend work on the southeast , we 'll focus on the western quadrant . - Get down , Taylor ! - Down ! Throw him in the brig . I 'll deal with him later . You wanna tell me who that was and what the hell 's going on here ? Come on , let 's take a drive . There 's a lot about this place you need to know . The school was nice , didn 't you think ? You know , a playground where you don 't have to wear a rebreather . I want to feed the dinosaurs again . You do , huh ? It 's probably not a good idea though , 'cause , if they get too full , then they get really sleepy , and it 's really noisy when the dinosaurs snore . Well , actually , brachiosauri aren 't really true herbivores , they sometimes supplement their diets with smaller reptiles . Which is why they had proto-lateral incisors . Two sets . Upper and lower . Okay . - I 'll see you guys later . Yeah . Kill me now . You can 't build civilization in a day , Shannon . There are bound to be a few setbacks . We 've had our share . - Yeah , like what ? - That fella who tried to put a bullet in me . He 's part of another settlement that split away from Terra Nova . Around here , people call them Sixers . They call them that ' cause they all came through on the Sixth Pilgrimage . At first they seemed just like the rest of us . But , pretty soon we began noticing some things . Like how curious they were about camp security procedures . By the time we found the cache of contraband weapons , it was clear . - They had an agenda . - What agenda ? Who sent them ? Believe me , many nights I 've asked myself the same thing . Long story short , they caught on that we caught onto them . And they high-tailed it , like thieves in the night . Pilfered a significant amount of equipment , and weapons . Maybe they gamed the lottery somehow . The thought has occurred to me . What did Hope Plaza have to say about all of this ? What makes you think I asked them ? Until we know who sent those people back and why , I just don 't know who in the future I can trust . This is what we 're fighting for , Jim . A new beginning , for all of us . If today 's shown me anything , it 's shown me that you 've got what it takes to be part of my security team here in Terra Nova . You asked me for a badge and a gun . They 're yours if you want them . Welcome aboard , Shannon . What is it ? What ? Taylor to base . Got a pair of transports inbound . And they 're coming in hot . - Who are they ? - Sixers . Things are about to get ugly . Taylor to Base . You got a visual on those Sixers ? We see them . But we got a work crew outside the gates . We need time to get them inside . I 'll try and slow them down . But get everybody inside as soon as you can . Over there ! Two o 'clock ! Whoa ! Look out ! What are they firing at ? ' Cause it 's not us . What the hell is that ? A carnotaurus . I hate carnotaurus . We 're all clear ! - What 's going on back there ? - Just keep , driving ! Situation 's changed . We 've got carnos out here . Get everyone inside . We 'll deal with the Sixers later . We 're almost there but you got to buy us more time . Hey , keep those people back . We got Sixers coming in ! - Take the wheel ! - What ? - Take the wheel ! - Okay . Okay . Hey ! Hey , look at me you ugly bastard ! This way ! Mom , what 's happening ? Come here . Stay down . Come on . Come on . What are you waiting for ? Sonics ! Go ! Back away ! Get back ! - Hello , Taylor . - What are you doing here , Mira ? This is no way to treat company . - Have your men lower their weapons . - You first . You 're outnumbered . Then what are you so afraid of ? - You came here for a reason . - You 've got one of my people . Carter got shot , while he was trying to siphon power off our grid . We know he 's alive and in your brig . You know this how ? Maybe we still have a few friends here in Terra Nova . Well , maybe I 'll have a sit-down with Carter , have a little chat about your friends . - We want Carter , you son of a bitch ! - Put your weapon down , now ! Put it down ! Put the weapon down ! - Enough ! - Stand down ! A trade . - What is that ? - Meteoric iron . They control the quarry . I want Carter , medical supplies and ammo . You can have your man . You can have the meds . No ammo . No way . Can 't blame a girl for trying . Guzman , get Carter out of the brig . Have Medical put together some supplies . You 're new . Welcome to paradise . - Dad . - You guys okay ? Yeah . How 'd you get yourself caught up in the middle of all that ? Taylor asked me to join Security . So , you 're gonna be a cop again ? Doctor Shannon , we could use a hand over in the infirmary . It 's all right . Go . I 'll take the girls back to the house . Come on . It 's okay . That wasn 't a very nice dinosaur . No , he wasn 't , was he ? - Is he gonna come back ? - You don 't have to worry about him , okay ? You 're safe here . - I wanna go home . - Oh ! You wanna go home , huh ? Uh-huh I know what you mean . It 's all the sunshine , isn 't it ? It 's way too bright . And the fresh air . Boy , does that ever get on my nerves . And what 's with all these flowers here , I mean , there 's too much color . - And they 're smelling up the place ... - Daddy . Come here , you are home , sweetie . We all are . I 'm telling you , Skye . - We 're close , Max . Trust me . I thought you said you came out here all the time ? Yeah , well , it 's been over a week . Okay . The jungle grows fast . Oh , yeah . Here . Here we go . How 'd we do ? We could use a couple more days maybe , but ... Well , it 's not bad . Hey , have a taste . That is moonshine . Cretaceous-style . - What is it made from ? - We call them fruts . You know , as in part fruit , part nut . Looks like we need a re-stock . All right , well , why don 't you guys go grab us some fresh ones . - And Josh and I will start cutting . - Let 's do that . Why give Mira the meds ? All we 're doing is making it more difficult to beat them . Look , Guz , we need the ore . You know that . Doc ? That 's enough iso-biotics . I don 't want us to run short . Look , I 'm sorry you got tangled up in that situation before . Security should 've been more careful with the prisoner . It wouldn 't be the first time a patient 's pulled a knife on me . Considering you put in time at a state hospital , I expect so . Doctor Shannon , I 'm curious , with your résumé , as accomplished as you are , you could 've had it pretty good back there . I mean , money and connections , you can buy a pretty good life . Maybe even one of those houses in one of the domes . Still , you chose to come here . Why ? Well , yeah , believe me , I 've had plenty of colleagues who 've gone down that route . Eking what they can from a world that 's on its last breath . But I didn 't want that for my children . I mean , I know life here is gonna present a lot of challenges , to say the least . But I think they deserve the chance to be part of something real . Something new . Something that has a future . I understand . I felt the same way about getting my own boy here . I didn 't know you had a son . Came in on the Second Pilgrimage . Worked right here in the Science Division . He went missing a few years back . - I 'm so sorry . - Well , there 's always the hope . I haven 't given up on him . Doctor Shannon , it 's good to have you here . I think you 're gonna do just fine . Can I just ask you to , please , to be careful with my husband . You asking him to be on your security team , that is between you and him . But you know , I 'm the one who stays up late worrying . I 'll make sure he gets home to you . What is this ? Oh . It 's the barb from a slasher-tail . The males all have them . - It 's sharp . - Yeah . You should see their teeth . - Don 't worry . They mostly hunt at night . - Yeah . Mostly ? No , thanks . Hey , I 'm sorry about what happened back there . The whole thing with my dad . You two don 't get along ? We 're just really different , that 's all . I mean , he can go from zero to infinity , in no second flat . You saw how bent out of shape he got . " That 's not how you start your first day , Josh . " " Oh , excuse me , miss , my son has somewhere to be . " He 's lecturing me about rules . He broke every rule in the book just to get here . Wait , no , he 's like , the kind of guy who would show up in a new place , and he 's like , " Oh , I 'm gonna ditch orientation " " and go for a swim with a bunch of people I barely know . " Right ? Yeah . You guys are pretty different . Pretty different . You 're bleeding again . Let me see . Look , I know things haven 't gone exactly like we planned . It 's all about to change . Delta One , can you read me ? - Delta One , can you read me ? - Go ahead , Delta Two . We spotted a vacated TN transport . Looks ripe . Grab the power supplies and any ammo you find . But move fast , they can 't be too far . This power cell 's jammed . Hurry it up already . - What 's with you ? - I thought I heard something . You 're always hearing things . Got it . Let 's get out of here . What was that ? - Probably just a howler . - Yeah , a howler . You know , it 's getting late . We should go . - You wanted to see me ? - Shannon , come on in . We 've got a situation here . One of our rovers went missing . Surveillance picked this up . A couple of our kids sneaking outside the perimeter . Josh . We 've been trying to reach the rover over the comm for the past half hour . - No response . - Night is falling . - No response . - Night is falling . If we don 't get to them pretty quick , something else might . Why in heaven 's name would he do something like that ? She must 've talked him into it . So , I 'm gonna go with the search party . " She " ? Who 's " she " ? That girl he met when he skipped orientation . I told him to go back but he wouldn 't listen . - Okay , I 'm going with you . - No , you 're not . It 's too dangerous . - Jim , our son is out there ! - Yeah , let me handle it ! No , you handling it is why he 's out there in the first place . Elisabeth ? Stay here . Watch your sister . - Dad , I 'm ... - It 's okay , everything 's gonna be okay . I promise . Damn it ! It 's stripped . The power cells are gone . This transport 's dead . Okay . Well , then we have to call somebody . We have to tell them that we 're out here . Did you hear what he said ? It 's dead . That means there is no radio . It 's too far to walk . We 'll never make it back before dark . Oh , God . What 's that ? - That 's a Sixer vehicle . - What 's a Sixer ? - Wait , where you going ? - Get our stuff back . Skye , no . I 'm not going over there . You can 't trust a Sixer . Whatever , Tash , I 'll handle them . Hello ? We 're not armed . Just wanna talk . Hey , we 're stuck out here without those power cells . Skye . Look , blood . Yo , guys , I got them . The cells are all here . Slasher ! Run ! Go ! Go ! Go ! - What is it ? - Slasher ! Just run . Get away from me ! - Come on , man . Let us in , please . - Hey , I remember you . You 're Drake . Right ? - It 's me , Skye . - Skye ? - All right , get in . - Come on . Get in . Let 's go ! Get in . Come on ! Go ! Hurry ! - Max , get this thing started ! - Well , it 's got an alpha-num keypunch , so , unless I know the code then ... - Okay , pop the panel , get it started . - I can 't . The rig 's booby trapped . Hey , Drake , hey , how do you get this thing started ? It 's dead . The power converter got crushed by a slasher-tail . Oh , my God . He 's really bleeding a lot . - Hey , your mom 's a doctor , right ? - Found weapons ! Tie this around his leg above the wound , as tight as you can . If you make it through this , you won 't be a fresh anymore . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Last known location is the outer market two klicks down the south east road . We 're gonna head in that direction and start scanning for heat signature . Hunter Boyce is missing . And Max Pope , too . - And another one . - Who ? - My daughter . - Tasha ? Weapons and ammo are in the vehicle . - You 'll need a medic . - No . Both parents , dangerous situation . - Bad idea . - Sorry , Jim . - No , I 'm going . No time for squabbles . Both of you ride with me ! Move out , people ! Most people know I was the first man through the portal . What people don 't know is that the men who came through behind me , well , they didn 't show up on this end right away . For them it was just the blink of an eye . For me , 118 days . Look , I know you 're scared for your boy . You have every reason to be . But the point is , this jungle can be survived . Why does it keep making that sound ? Oh , God ! There 's another one . Slashers hunt in packs . They corner their prey and signals the others . Before long there 'll be dozens . We 're stuck in here ! We 're trapped , okay ! What about the radio ? Can we get it to work without the converter ? The comm won 't work . But Alvarez might have a portable one in his pack . - On the floor . - Hunter , get it out ! In that bag . Got it . If anybody can hear this , Terra Nova , come in ! - We 're going in circles . - No , we 're establishing a search grid . - Well , what if they 're outside the grid ? - Then we expand it . Anybody hear this ? We need help . Come in . Terra Nova ... Copy that , this is Tango November One . Identify yourself . Commander Taylor ! This is Hunter Boyce . We 're stuck in a rover outside the perimeter . - Is your rover operational , Hunter ? - Sixers jacked our power cells . Hunter do you copy ? Slasher ? Say that again . Say it again , about slasher . - Conserve your ammo . Short bursts . - Got it ! - Hunter , say again about slashers . - Three , maybe more . We 're about 80 meters ... - Eighty meters ? - I said we 're about 80 meters east ... East of what ? Oh , my God . Where is it ? Josh , grab the radio ! I got it . I got it . Hello , are you still there ? We 're about 80 kilometers east ... - That 's Josh . - Josh ? Josh , it 's your dad . Could not copy last transmission . Please repeat . Dad ? Is that you ? Do you copy , Josh ? Please repeat . Josh ? Out of the way ! My side 's clear . - Mine , too . You think they left ? Don 't assume anything with slashers . Our gunfire drove them away for now , but they 'll regroup and come back . No , we should make a run for it while we still can . - Make a run for what ? - Terra Nova ! That 's like five klicks away . Tash , we 'd never make it . We have weapons , and anything is better than being sitting ducks ! And we don 't know how many of them are out there , - And we have limited ammunition . - Hey , I may be a " fresh , " but , I mean , Commander Taylor got our distress call . Commander Taylor knows we 're in trouble . We just gotta hold on a little while longer for him to get here . It could take them hours to find us ! We have enough ammo to hold off those slashers a little while longer . - We can make it . My God ! He doesn 't even know - What he 's talking about ! Tasha ... They can smell his blood ! They 're gonna come back ! - Calm down ! - We 're not gonna make it . - Tasha ! - Tasha ! Tasha ! Stop it ! It 's suicide ! - Hi . - Hey . What are you doing here ? Well , with everything going on , I wanted to make sure you were okay . Yeah . You know , we 're okay , considering . We haven 't heard back from the search team yet , but , shouldn 't be long though , I 'm sure your brother 's gonna to be okay . - If you need anything , just ... - Don 't go . Zoe 's scared . Right , Zoe ? This is Tango November . I have all frequencies open . Hunter , do you copy ? Josh Shannon , do you copy ? This is Commander Taylor . Just keep heading east . I think that 's where the signal originated . With all this technology , shouldn 't they know ? - Elisabeth ... - Anywhere else we would know . - But this is some dense jungle out here . - Watch out ! Oh , God ! What 's her name ? - It 's Tasha . - Okay , Tasha , can you hear me ? I 'm a doctor , okay . I 'm right here . It 's me , Dad . I 'm right here , honey . I need you to apply pressure to this wound . Dig it in . - Tasha , you stay with me , okay ? - Slashers came , fired the gun . - Can you tell me where the others are ? No . We 'll get her safely to the hospital as soon as I stabilize her . Tasha , did you have to go through water to get here ? There 's a stream about a half a click north of here . Rocco , you stay here with Guz and the Doc . Yes , sir . The rest of you , gather up . Just in case . Jim , wait . Look , I 'm sorry , about what I said before . This is not your fault . Yes , it is . Josh came out here with these kids just to spite me . Spite you ? No , he is you . A pretty girl and a chance to break the rules . You 'd have done the same thing at his age . Well , you should know . You were that girl . Bring him back . I will . Max , say we make a run for our rover , are those power cells usable ? This one 's completely drained . The other two are half charged . If Hunter and I cover you , how fast do you think you can get those power cells installed ? Maybe five , ten minutes . I say we make a run for our rover , power it up and get the hell out of here . Hunter , check the cylinders on our weapons . We could to do this , you guys . Come on . - Are you hurt ? - I 'm fine . You 're pretty good at this whole taking charge thing . Yeah , well , my dad was a corporal under Commander Taylor . - I guess he kinda rubbed off on me . - Was ? Syncillic fever . Mom , too . Sorry . Everybody loses their parents sooner or later . And what 's not supposed to happen is the other way around . Let 's try to get the hell out of here in one piece , all right ? If we do engage slashers , aim for the underbelly . Hides are too thick for the tranq-guns to penetrate . Stay five meters clear of their tails . Tango November , this is Guz , do you copy ? - Yeah , I 'm here . - We 're taking Tasha back to camp . - Doc says she needs surgery . - Understood . - Hey , Guz , she 's in good hands . - Keep sharp eyes . Mira 's in your area . We picked up Sixers radio chatter . Damnation ! Copy that ! - Mira , just what I need right now ! - Her people always this much trouble ? Yeah , so far . I don 't know who sent them . I don 't know why . But I 'll tell you this , I 'm not gonna let them , I 'm not gonna let anybody stand in the way of what we are building here . Terra Nova will succeed . How 's it looking , Josh ? Looks like we 've got a clear run to the vehicle . - Okay . I think we 're clear on this side . - This side , too . All right , remember , stay together . We all set ? Look , maybe this isn 't such a good idea . Maybe we should just stay here and wait for help . - We talked about this . We can 't stay here . - Just , take it easy , man . Look , if a slasher 's gonna munch on any of us , it won 't be your scrawny ass . Hunter ? Hunter ? Give me a hand . - We 've got to get to the rover . - What about Hunter ? I 'll stay and cover him . You guys just get those power cells in and get that thing moving . I 'm out ! Come on . Flank and tranq ! Establish a perimeter . Keep moving , Skye . I got you covered . - Josh ! - Dad ! Josh . Get down ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's me . It 's over . Get him in the transport . Max ! Oh , God ! You 're gonna be okay . You all right , young lady ? - Tasha , she tried to make it back to camp . - We got her . - You said there were Sixers ? - Yeah , over there . With me . He 's gone . Mira . She came for her man . - Let 's get you looked at . - Try not to put too much weight on it . Guess we know why they call them slashers , huh ? I 'm sorry . - I 'm sorry . - It 's okay . I wanna say how sorry I am for what happened today . I know . You 've been so good to me since my folks ... I just don 't like to disappoint you . Well , you 're still in one piece . That the important thing , now . And now you know why that area 's off limits . Sir ? Well , it 's slasher territory . Yeah , of course . So , just what were you all doing out there anyhow ? Dumb stuff . Drinking . You didn 't go anywhere near the falls , did you ? - No , sir . - Good . Good . Those can be some treacherous waters . Someone was definitely here . Found footprints . It was those kids . Taylor 's not gonna like that . He wants to keep all this under wraps . Why doesn 't he just blast them off the rocks ? 'Cause these are the only connection he has left to his son . I still don 't get why that crazy bastard does this out here ? Why do you think ? To throw it in his old man 's face . Every time he gets closer to an answer , he puts it here for Taylor to see . To remind him . The real reason for Terra Nova 's existence . Control the past . Control the future . These are the key , to everything . Is it going to fall on us ? Is what going to fall on us , sweetie ? What is it ? That , my little Zoe , is the Moon . And , no , it 's not gonna fall on us . Wow , I almost forgot what it looks like . I was a kid , when the air got so bad , you couldn 't see it anymore . Was it always so big ? Not always . It moves about a half a centimeter away from the Earth every year . So , it 's much closer than it was yesterday . You mean tomorrow . You know what I mean . The sky 's insane . This whole place is . The stars are all different here , too . They 're not in the same place as in 2149 , because the universe has had 85 million fewer years to expand , I mean , do the math . We 'll just leave the math up to you , sweetie .

 And now " The transcredible exploits of Zapp Brannigan " brought to you by Bartley 's rocket wax . I wax my rocket every day ! No one can save you now , Leela . What about Zapp Brannigan ? Well , obviously , Zapp Brannigan could save you , but ... Zapp Brannigan ? ! So , Emperor Chopchop , once again , we meet at last . Drop that space gun or I 'll shoot ... like so . Ooh . Oh ! Oh , Zapp . Tie me back up and ravish me . I 'd like to , Leela , so I will . Mmm , shake it , baby . Shake it like ... I surrender and volunteer for treason . Emergency summons from the president , Captain . Oh , it 's you . Just let me freshen up . Computer , Captain 's musk . The long , dramatic corridor . That 's never a good sign . Glove recognized . Proceed , Mrs. Eisenhower . Mr. President . What the hell ? At ease , Brannigan . What you 're about to see is highly classified . Reptilicus , hit the thingy . At oh-zero-hundred hours , planet X-3 was attacked by a mysterious death-sphere . Magnify that death-sphere . Why is it still blurry ? That 's all the resolution we have . Making it bigger doesn 't make it clearer . It does on CSI : Miami . They fought back with advanced military hardware , but it was like shooting bbs at Bebe Rebozo . That poor , brave hardware . The sphere then fired some kind of hellish blackout ray . Erased that planet like 18 minutes of incriminating tape . Oh , I just wish I understood why . Why I should care . Because the death-sphere is now on course for Earth . Aroo ! My God , we 're defenseless , like fish in a barrel . Options ? My instinct is to hide in this barrel like the wily fish . Ah , then we 're down to our last hope : A radical new weapon built by a visionary scientist I once dismissed as crazy . Let 's see how crazy I am now , Nixon . The correct answer is " very . " All right , Professor , sock it to me . Top secret news , everyone . I 've developed a tiny , one-man stealth fighter that 's virtually undetectable . How undetectable ? It 's right in front of you . I find that ... Ow ! ... To believe . Hubba , hubba . But how exactly is this happy meal toy going to destroy a giant death-sphere ? From within . This ship should be able to sneak , undetected , through the sphere 's one vulnerable opening . What vulnerable opening ? All death-spheres have one vulnerable opening . Well , sure , but who 's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death-sphere ? I say Brannigan . I say no . - I say me . - I say Leela . - I say yes . - I say no . I say Leela , too . I say yes again . I say I shall join her . But it 's only a one-man craft . I say . There 'll only be one man ... Me . How would you feel if I rode rear as your personal tail gunner ? Creeped out . Then it 's decided . Cape Knievel Flight Test Center Are you sure I have to sit in your lap ? It 'll help us achieve maximum thrust . I made you some trail mix for the flight . Also , this picture , to remember me . You hold onto it . I 'll be back soon . Aah ! Activating stealth shielding . Liftoff ! I 'll Roger that . Does anybody else feel aroused and jealous and worried ? I haven 't felt much of anything since my Guinea pig died . Death-sphere in range . Engaging holographic targeting . Activating the force . Male voice Feel the entrance , Leela . Destination on your left in 0.3 miles . Zapp to Leela . Look at all that surveillance equipment . We better whisper . Switching to pillow talk mode . Look ! What are those huge letters ? V-giny ? Doesn 't ring a bell . Hmm , I don 't like the looks of this V-giny . Does anyone recognize those call letters ? Nope . It 's not in the janeway 's guide either . Deciphering that I.D. Code is critical . I 'll be in the chamber of understanding . This is it ... the moment we should have trained for . Holy cr ... Incoming yucky . Firing pocket-rocket ! Don 't panic , Leela . Go , go , go , go , go . I hope this is the control stick . Captain 's log . We 've lost control . Addendum ... Chapter two : " The heat thickens . " Leela , wake up . I can 't face this mysterious planet alone without you or someone like you . Zapp ? Zapp , wake up . Leela , where are we ? We crashed on an uncharted planet . When I woke up , I was pinned under this tree . Can you help me ? If anyone can move it , I can . No one can move it . Are you hurt ? No , but I 'm so thirsty . This space suit is making me sweat like a sow . Me , too . We 'd better strip them off and continue surviving au naturel . Uh ... I suppose so . Here , we can cover ourselves with these sticky , sap-covered leaves . I 'll try to avert my eyes from your nudery . You will ? Eh , what 's the point ? You 'll have to look sooner or later . Well , I promise not to abuse the privilege . For now I 'd better scout ound for food and water and help . What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say . What the hell 's wrong with you ? I 'm not quite sure . Perhaps it 's the fresh air or a severe head injury . In any case , I 'm off . If you see any steaks , that 'd be good ! Why isn 't Leela back yet ? Do you think she 's okay ? How should I know ? And how come you never ask if I 'm okay ? I 'm feeling a little neglected here . Oh , sorry . Are you okay , Bender ? Shut up . What difference does it make ? When that death-sphere gets here , we 'll all be blown to manwich meat . Well , I guess it 's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery . Who 's up for an orgy ? Maybe a parcheesi tournament . Belay that parcheesi tournament . I 've identified the death-sphere . We may yet have a faint hope of survival . Still , a parcheesi tournament . This is a top secret military satellite launched by the air force in 1998 . And this is a top secret FCC satellite launched that same year to censor indecent TV programs . Like The Pimpsons and Ass-o-rama ? Precisely . However , the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again . I found the board ! Now I 've simulated that collision using shrapnel-vision . V-giny ! Granted , all that makes perfect sense . But why is this death-sphere destroying planets ? That makes the most sense of all . Lookt the planets it 's destroyed so far . First came X-3 the nude beach planet , then Poopiter , and finally that world that can 't be mentioned in polite company . You mean ... How dare you . So the death-sphere is " censoring " indecent planets ? Indeed , and we 're next , if we can 't keep it in our collective pants . Our sole hope is to persuade the people of earth to abandon their smutty ways . So the orgy 's off ? So thirsty . Why couldn 't a water fountain have fallen on me ? I couldn 't find any water , but the moisture in these fruit-nut-berries should sustain you . Thank you . I climbed perilously high into the trees to pick them , yet I saw no sign of intelligent life . Bummer . Moreover , the crash totally destroyed our ship . So we 're stuck here until someone finds us ? Alas , that may never happen . Stealth technology makes the ship impossible to locate , yet easy to stub your crotch on . Well , there 's worse places to be marooned . Plenty of food , mild climate . I 's a veritable garden of eden . It is ? Hello . Did that snake say hello ? No . We 're both delirious from dehydration . Just like Adam and Eve . We can still save Earth . People are sure to clean up their act when presented with cold , hard facts by rational folks like us . The end is near ! Repent thy sins ! I 'll thinks it overs while I engages is five-dollar hooker . Don 't do it ! It 's not worth it ! Okay , make it three dollars . Yuck ! I don 't wants no three-dollar hooker . I 'm going backs to the adults bookstore . Adult bookstore ? I thought this was the public library . No . Pubic library . Zapp ? Where are you ? Oh , God , I 'm actually starting to miss him . Maybe you two belong together . We do not . And you can 't talk . Oh , come on . It must be an awful temptation . Guess who just killed a woodchuck with his bare feet ? I thought I 'd whip us up some shelter . Make this a little more like home . I do miss the Earth terribly . I wonder if it 's even still there ? Let 's find out together . I 'll brave the ship 's wreckage to fetch you the telescope . That 's so sweet . I 'm just sayin ' , is all . I know my new plan is a long shot , but it 's the only hope left . Well , now I 've heard everything . On my iPod . So , do you have a new plan , Professor ? And is there any hope left ? Indeed . We 're here on Earth 's last unspoiled acre to show the death-sphere there 's still purity in the world . Begin transmitting . Commence purity chant . Hey , I 'm proud of you , Bender ... avoiding sin for almost a full minute . Bender ? Oh yeah , baby , you 're quite a dish . Oh , yeah . Oh , no . Oh , yeah . Ooh ! - Oh , no . - Bender , stop ! Stop ! Eh , quiet your riot . What 's the worst that could happen ? No ... no ! Earth is gone ! We 're the only two humans left in the universe ! Oh , God , I 'm sorry , Leela . Maybe ... maybe this was meant to be . Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here . We can avoid humanity 's mistakes . Like the tuba . Yes ! We 'll be like Adam and Eve . Only without the tuba . And we 'll beget little Zapp junior . And Leela junior . And they 'll have kids of their own . Yuck ! Is that really what happened in the Bible ? It 's a sick and twisted book of holiness , all right . Then we 'll write our own Bible . With less Sodom and more Gomorrah . Let 's do it . I shall become the mother of a new world , trapped here , under this tree . The tree of knowledge . Look , it even has apples ! Ow ! Wow ! Come here , Adam . Partake of my forbidden fruit . Thee will be done . Wait . One more bite before we begin the begetting . Mmm . Juicy . Those nut-berries you found were so salty , I couldn 't think straight . I mean , not to belabor it , but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me . Exactly as salty . Hey ! Wait a second ! Uh ... Oh ... I have a terrible confession to make . You see , when I first went foraging , what I actually found was the smoldering wreckage of the ship . Ignoring all danger , I charged inside to liberate our provisions . So this is the trail mix Fry gave me ! Yes . I exaggerated when I said I picked it from the treetops . I just wanted you to think ... A little better of me . Well ... your motives were good . And we were both loopy from dehydration . Hey , wait . You 've been doing an awful lot of urinating . There 's plenty of water . You see , after I selflessly rescued the trail mix , i braved the flames once more , in search of fluids . Then why didn 't you give me any ? I thought it might help you forget your intense hatred for me if you were a teensy bit delirious . So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water ? Not exactly . You see , besides the trail mix , the minibar also contained doritos , beef jerky , and a generous assortment of fine chocolates . I wanted to offer you the chocolates ... I truly did ... but I was concerned about your waistline . Very concerned . It 's because I haven 't been exercising . If only this tree hadn 't fallen on me by chance . Oh , dear God ! It was just after we crashed . I awoke first , to find you trapped . Leela ! Leela , wake up . You could 've moved this grub-infested log any time you wanted ? Well , sure ... But then I wouldn 't have been able to provide the loving care you wouldn 't have needed . I 'd leave you to rot in this paradise , if only the ship weren 't destroyed . The ship 's fully functional , isn 't it ? You see , after re-trapping you and before feigning unconsciousness , i paused to enjoy a cigar . Though mellow and satisfying , it did parch me a bit , so I went in search of Brandy . That 's when my keen senses detected the still-invisible ship . Ow ! So we can go back to Earth ? But there is no Earth anymore ! Everyone I know is dead ! Ah , this seems like a good place to take a dump . Leela ? ! You 're alive ! Fry ! But how did you find this planet ? Well ? We 're actually on Earth . The ship 's homing device brought us back . But I saw Earth explode . I 'm actually kind of proud of this one . You see , what you saw was merely a simulation I rigged up , using the ship 's holographic targeting projector . The alleged " telescope " was a toilet paper tube . You said there wasn 't any toilet paper ! And that humanity was annihilated ! My motives were pure . I just wanted to you to think we had to save humanity so you 'd be willing to have sex . Please say you believe me . Yes , I believe you . Hee-ya ! Yay ! There must be something to steal on this island . Hey , it 's Leela . Let 's go home , everybody . At least the world wasn 't destroyed . Yet . People of Earth ! Hear the righteous word of the mighty V-giny ! The mighty V-giny ! Seeing you frolic in this unspoiled garden gives hope that this world may yet be redeemed . Huzzah ! The purity chant worked ! Unacceptable wardrobe malfunction ! I was referring to Adam and Eve ! We 're not Adam and Eve . You see , due to a series of ... Consummate your union , or I shall destroy Earth . Well ... if it 's to save Earth ... I guess I could take one for the team . Uh , what ? Right now ? ! But I need a romance first . Maybe a vanilla candle or something ? Commence intercourse ! Those giant guns are making me feel sort of inadequate . I 'm not sure if I can ... Move it . I gotta get home and do laundry . For God 's sake , censor it ! Censor it ! Approved for all audiences ! No ! And now , the spicy finale of ... That was a close call , but we saved Earth . Was it as good for you as it was for the human race ? Oh , Zapp . Let 's save another planet right now !

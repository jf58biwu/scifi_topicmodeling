 Now frost occupies the land Freezes the blood in the veins Sings a song of coldness And grips the land with gigantic hold ... Slave of Winter Kristján Jónsson , Mountain Poet - Ready ? - Yes . Look over here . Smile a little . - Do you see anything ? - No . Can you see how deep it is ? No , I can 't see it that well . Robert ! What is it ? Everything okay ? Robert ? - l just ... - We have to go there now ! - lt 's just ... - Okay , I 'll go down ! Let me go down , maybe we 'll see something interesting . No . We should not go on unless we are sure of the circumstances . - The guys are gone and ... - Robert ... It will be my responsibility . Just help me go down , that 's all you have to do . No , Agla , I have a bad feeling about this . I felt it ! Okay . If you won 't help me , then I 'll do it myself . - Can you handle this ? - Yes . I am just going to have a quick look . It will only take 10 minutes . - Relax ! - Remember to lock . Relax ! I couldn 't see how deep it was ... I 'll just throw a rock , have a Snickers while I 'm down there . This is magnificent ... A few days ago , I came across a hole or some kind of an abyss . Northwest of the camp . Weird sounds were coming from it and some kind of light . Now I am in that hole down to a cave or something that looks like it was formed in ... Fuck ! Are you okay ? Yeah . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Did you see anything strange down there ? There was nothing there . Just a cave . - l saw some light . - Wasn 't that just the camera light ? I was calling and calling , why didn 't you answer ? I slipped down there and I didn 't hear anything . - Were you hurt ? - No , no ... - Are you okay ? - Yes . Let 's just get back . What was that roaring sound ? What sound ? Didn 't you hear a sound like thunder down there ? No . - Did you get hurt ? - No , what is wrong with you ? Should I drive ? - ls it working ? - Yeah , - Good , - This is awesome , Do you always have so much gear when you 're filming ? It weighs a lot , lt . ' s only three cameras and the gear , - Do you do a lot of these kind of things ? - Yeah , We 're making a documentary for the Glacial Research Centre , lt might end up on TV , Isn 't that Agla ? It is her , Roger , Roger , Surprise ! - What are you doing here ? - l 've got connections ! Hi , I 'm Arnar . We decided to surprise you . Let the guy come up here . - How are you ? - Hi . Come give me a kiss . I 'll leave you to it . Did you bring all the cameras with you ? No , just a few . - Don 't you have the little camera ? - Yes . - Have you used it much ? - No . Well , maybe a little bit . I 've shot a little . Am I interrupting something ? Should I not have come ? I 've missed you so much . Now come here , let 's make out . - Wanna ride the snowmobile ? - Sure . We 'll meet the others later right now they 're cooking . Arnar , do you have a helmet for him ? Hi , I 'm Gunnar . Right , I 'm Robert . You 've got something there ... Agla ... Agla . What are you doing ? Stop it . - How 'd you sleep ? - l 'm wiped out . - Dreamt some weird stuff ... - Yes and waking up . - You 're always working . - lt 's so fucking cold ... You 're fucking cold ... Knock it off . If this ends up in the film , I 'll kill you . - What ? - Knock it off . - What ? - l just woke up . It 's a documentary , everybody looks like shit . Maybe you , but not me . Me ? I woke up a while ago . Have you been outside ? - No . - Yes , you have . No . - Have you made coffee ? - No . I 'd kill for some coffee . Should I make some for you ? You 're crushing me . I 'm stuck here . Fucking zipper . Did you see the guys leave ? Gunnar ? No , I didn 't . - You 've been up for a while ? - No , maybe 30 minutes . The sun 's coming up . Agla , do you think some of the guys might agree to an interview ? - Probably , sure . - When do they get back ? - How did things go abroad ? - lt went fine . Was a bit hectic , though . It was better in Barcelona . Oh , okay . - Any idea what the weather forecast is like ? - No ... lt would be meaningless up here , anyway . How come ? The glacier has its own distinct meteorological activity . It can be sunny and calm up here while the weather is terrible below . Okay . I was wondering when I woke up , how wild it is to be on a glacier . There are no ... I mean , I know that tourists come up here , and ... But ... What I 'm trying to say is when you 're abroad , for example , like the trip I got back from , everything somehow seems the same , you know ? Everything just the same . Not everything . No ... But still , in many ways they are . The same stores , same food , same music almost all the same . Except for ... The girls . What ? If you want to look at girls overseas , then go for it . Agla . This film sure will be philosophical . Where are you going ? - l 'm gonna have a look around outside . - Huh ? What a wuss . You think this is funny ? We dig in the ice and take samples , then we catalogue them here . There 's the whole team . Six guys , and my girlfriend is the only woman . - Great . - Base camp to research expedition , over ! - Shouldn 't you have gone with them ? - Preferably , yeah . But I have paperwork to finish . Base camp to research expedition , over ! What is your job here ? I mean , what are you supposed to do ? I help with the research , and things that need to be done . It 's wonderful experience for my master 's thesis . - Base camp to research expedition , over ! - ls it busted ? No , I don 't think so . They 're just not answering . Now it 's starting to get interesting . Costa del Sol ... Base camp to research expedition , over ! - Base camp to research expedition , over ! - No answer ? No . If they 're on skis , they couldn 't have gone far , right ? Base camp to research expedition - on skis - over ! Don 't you have an NMT phone ? No . It was in the snow plough . What about a satellite phone ? - No . - No . Base camp to research expedition , on skis , over ! Okay , start walking ! There are six people sleeping in tents like this . The supervisors sleep inside . - What are you doing ? - l 'm checking on the snowmobiles . Aren 't they all here ? - Yeah . - The snow plough is missing . Yeah , but they wouldn 't all fit in it . I don 't get it . If this is some kind of joke , then it 's not funny . I 'm going to walk around and get some footage . - You want to use a snowmobile ? - Can I ? Sure . Just follow the trail I showed you , or you 'll be in the crevice area . There should be a marker somewhere . Don 't we need to dig up the sleds ? You go do that . I 'll go finish the paperwork . Wow , man ! This is just ... Goddamn amazing . You didn 't see them ? Couldn 't they have gone off the glacier ? And left us up here all alone ? No , that 's ridiculous . Fuck it , they 'll be back before dark . Let 's go inside , I 'm getting cold . Agla ! Agla ! - l knew we had another one left . - Look ! What was that ? What ? I thought I saw someone . It could be them . No , we 'll hear them when they get back . So ... How do you feel about being back up here , as a real scientist ? It 's fun , I get to see the gang again . Don 't you miss being here , like , all the time ? Yes , a little . I 'm here now , with you . That 's fun . Yes . So ... What do you think of being on a glacier ? It 's insane . Unbelievable beauty up here . I think I get where you 're coming from now . - Really ? - Yeah , I think so . What is it that you " get " ? Well ... Like all those travel books you have . What 's the name of that book that you 're always reading ? Songlínes ? - ls that the one about the Aborigines ? - Yes . That , for example . The first time I read it , I was in college . It made me want to jump on a plane and see the world with a pen , a writing pad and camera in hand . I see . Well hand me your plate . We weren 't cramping their style , were we ? No , not at all. I work here . I just thought they were a little weird . They acted so stiff when we arrived last night . Probably just tired . Dance with me . God damn it ... What are you doing ? Stop filming . I thought maybe we 'd make our own Paris Hilton video . No ! - Come on , don 't be shy . - Turn it off . - Dance for me . - Turn it off . Stop it ! - Hi . - Hi . Are you getting tipsy ? No . I 'm not sure you should drink that much . No . - l 'm not pregnant ! - You 're not ? - No . - Are you sure ? Yeah . Well , shouldn 't we fix that then ? You want to tape it or ... - l 'm up for it if you are . - l am . Agla . Agla , come here . Come see the northern lights , they 're unbelievable . Why are you still awake ? - l can 't sleep because of the noise . - What noise ? - The noise . - What ? The cracking noise . This glacier cracks , doesn 't it ? - Yeah , but not here . - What ? It only cracks when it 's rolling forward , and that 's not happening here . Get in here and go back to sleep . Did you hear that ? You must have heard that . What was that ? What was that ? - What was that ? - l don 't know . Wasn 't that the ice cracking ? - No , it 's not cracking . - This is what I was talking about . - Come on ! - Yeah , yeah ... - Where is the noise coming from ? - l don 't know ! Gunnar ! You 're only wearing socks . Why do you say that ? That was an earthquake , right ? Maybe , but that doesn 't explain the noise or the flash . Isn 't there lightning in volcanic eruptions ? No , we 'd hear the thunder . What is it then ? Agla ? I don 't know what this is . I 'm shaking here . Did you get a shot of the flash ? No , but ... Maybe I got it on the other camera . Sit down . Let me see . Damn it ! The generator 's dead . Let me see . See , there . You think it will happen again ? I knew this would happen . The light 's too bright , it overloads the camera . I 'm gonna try to turn down the iris . Maybe that way we can see something if there 's another flash . Isn 't it just low on fuel ? No , I put some fuel in today . It won 't start . Could you shine the light over here ? Gunnar ! What are you looking for ? What are you looking for ? The book where we write down the drilling coordinates . So I can find out where the guys are . - There are no new coordinates . - See anything in there ? - They didn 't write in the book . - What ? They didn 't fill in the information . - Please be still . Gunnar . - Oh , sorry . They haven 't written anything down . They didn 't write down the new drilling coordinates . So ... Where are they , then ? I don 't know . I don 't understand . - Hello . - Hello ! Hello . Check the tents ! - What ? - Check inside the tent ! Hello . I thought there was someone there . Hello . - There 's nobody here ! - l 'm telling you , there was someone here . - Hello ! - Hello ! Here . I heard something over there . Check inside the house . Hello ! Hello ! Hello ! - There 's no one here . - Down there ? - Hello ! - Hello ! - Where 'd you see him ? - There ! He was on the other side but he could have moved . I don 't know . Hello ! is anyone there ? - Hello ! - Hello ! - This is crazy . - ls anyone there ? There 's no one here , Gunnar . Can you turn on the camera light ? I can 't see anything . That 's enough . - Really ? - Yeah , that 's enough . You have to pull harder . I know , Gunnar ! I 'll do it . Move aside . I 'll try the other sled . I already tried , it 's the one I was on today . It 's dead . Fuck . What do we do ? - No clue . - We 're not about to walk . No , it 's too far away . What do you think is wrong with the sleds ? I don 't know . We could use the skis . There aren 't any skis around here , Gunnar ! We 'll just have to sit tight , won 't we ? Someone 's bound to show up eventually , people know we 're up here . This is fucking bullshit ! We 'll sleep in the shed for the night . I 'm not sleeping in that damn tent ! I 'm gonna try the radio again , see if we can 't reach the guys . Then I 'm going to contact Rescue . Rescue ! Yeah , right . Fucking bullshit ! Well ... Could that have been an airplane ? Agla , could that have been an airplane ? The U.S. Army is always making some kind of spy plane . Some of them aren 't even manned , just a guy on the ground with a joystick , flying them . It could be something like that . I don 't think so . Base camp to research team , over ? is the radio gone as well ? The generator is running again . The generator is ... Agla ! There 's someone out there ! There 's someone outside ! - Hello ! - Hello ! Hello ! There ! There ! I see him , he 's there ! Go get the red bag . - This one ? - Yes . Arnar ! Ready ? One , two , and ... Open the door . Watch out for the corner . - Where do you want him ? - There ... - Where do you want him ? - There . Here ? Should we cover him up ? Like this ? You wanna leave ? His book ... What is it ? His book ... Maybe it has the coordinates , so we can find the others . - Agla ! - Fuck ... Agla ! If anyone can hear me , my name is Agla Helgadottir , and I am calling from the base camp of the glacial research expedition . There are two of us here . One man is dead and five others are missing . Please send help , I don 't know what is going on here ... Careful . Okay . - You okay ? - Yeah . - l 'm sorry about Arnar . - Yes . - So , how do you think ... - What ? - What did he die from ? - l 'm not sure . Hypothermia ? The blood ... Maybe . The others are probably out there somewhere ... - Yeah . - ... in the snow . Shouldn 't we at least try to look for them ? We won 't find anything in this dark . We can try tomorrow . I 'm so tired . Just lie down on the pillow . Here . Lay down . Gunnar , wake up ! - What 's happening ? Where is the camera ? - On the floor . Agla ? Everything all right ? Yes. I 'm all right . Gunnar . Arnar 's snow goggles . Will you turn that bloody camera off ? No , we have to record all of this . Gunnar , this cold is hell on such sensitive equipment . Agla , something strange is happening here . We must film it . - lf those lights come back ... - Don 't start falling apart on me . Just calm down . I 'm calm . We have to find the others . Come on . Hold on , Agla ... What are you doing ? Wait . This is so fucked up . What have you got there ? I already have axes . Just in case . There was blood on the goggles . Take it . - Just in case . - Gunnar ! Agla , take it . What ? Arnar ? Arnar ? Arnar ? Arnar ? What happened , Arnar ? I thought you were dead . He was dead . I 'm so tired . Arnar ? Arnar ? Talk to me ! What happened here ? We woke something up . - Just let me sleep . - Arnar ... Just let me sleep . Hello , Arnar ! is he alive ? Arnar ? There 's a faint pulse . There 's a faint pulse . Okay . And now ? Lay him down on the bed . God damn it . Now what ? - Will he be all right ? - l don 't know . We have to find the others . See anything ? No . The map says that the drill site should be about two klicks from here . We 'll have to walk there . Did you try the radio again ? Yeah , still no reply . We should get going right away while it 's still daylight . Fuck . - Let 's go . - Yes . All right ? The damn piece of junk is dead . This piece of shit is dead . What do we do now , turn back ? No , it 's just over there . Where ? - There ? - Take off your backpack . - No , just come over here . - No . Hold up . Sit down . - Okay . - Are you sure ? Yes . I 'll take the camera . Everything all right ? - Try to drink something . - Yeah . Gunnar , don 't eat the snow you can get hypothermia . I don 't even know where we 're going ! - lt all looks the same . - Straight ahead . Straight ahead . We must hurry , the weather 's getting worse . Fuck . It doesn 't work . The NMT phone doesn 't work . There 's blood here ... What ? What is this ? Could just be a bloody nose because of the weather or whatever . Agla ! What ? Over here , there 's blood here more blood over here . Hello ? Robert ? Guys ? Hello ? - Hello ? - Hello ? - There is someone down there . - l 'm going down . We 're coming down ! We 're on our way ! - Agla ! Agla. I 'm going down . - No . - Agla . - No . - l don 't like this . - lt 's no big thing . He 's just down there , I can see him . - Gunnar ... - This won 't take long . Lower me down . Okay , ready ? Pull twice on the line and I 'll pull you up . Okay . Let 's go . - Gunnar . - Yes ? Be careful . I 'm all right . Gunnar ! I 'm fine . Stop , no more slack. I said no more slack ! Hello ? Are you okay ? Hey , Robert . Robert ? Do you hear me ? Robert ? I 'm gonna take you topside . - Where are the others ? - Turn off the light . Turn it off . Why ? - What ? - Stop it . - What was that ? - Stop it . What was it ? Robert where are you ? Robert ! Robert ! I wanna get up ! Agla ! Get me out ! Pull me up ! Pull me ! Now ! Pull me up ! Agla ! Agla ! I don 't wanna be down here ! Help ! Help ! - What 's down there ? - l want to get out of here now ! What happened ? There was something down there ! Something took him ! Took who ? Took Robert . Agla , listen to me ! We have to go ! God , you 're all covered in blood ! We have to go ! - Now ! - What are you talking about ? Gunnar , what was down there ? I don 't know what it was . What are you doing ? Don 't do it ! Gunnar ! Gunnar ! Gunnar , look at me ! Try to get up on your feet . - l can 't ... - Gunnar , we have to get out of here . Listen to me ... You ... You heard it , too ... You saw it , too ... - Gunnar ! - l can 't ... - Gunnar , get up ! - Leave , just leave . - Leave . - Gunnar ! We can 't reach our snow truck and we 're about to leave ourselves . - Please wait a bit . - Wait ? I have men up there and I can 't reach them . - We leave immediately . - No , not just yet . - What do you mean ? - You have to give me some time . What 's going on here ? No one goes anywhere unless I say so . Understood ? It 's on your ass , just so you know it . Guys , we have to wait ... Do you have a time of death ? My guess is about eight hours ago . What 's her condition ? Fine , considering . The doctor examined her and she looks fine . No traumas . Okay . Hi , I 'm Detective Andri from the police . Who 's in charge here ? What do you mean ? Who 's in charge here ? I suppose it 's me . You mustn 't send anyone up there . You have to call off the rescue team . I 'm not about to do that . We found two dead men along with you at the foot of the glacier and as far as we can ... You 're not hearing me . You have to stop them ! I have two dead men here . There are others from the research team still up there . What happened to them ? - Forget them . - What are you saying ? That I should just leave them there to die ? Have you seen the recordings ? Yes , and there are things there that warrant an explanation . Like what ? There are things there that I just don 't understand . They show what happened on the glacier . What does it all mean ? What were you and Gunnar doing up there ? What difference does that make ? It 's a perfectly reasonable question . He wanted to see the glacier . Did they do something to you ? What do you mean by that ? - You know what I mean . - Yeah . But it 's disrespectful both to me and my co-workers . My friends . We disturbed something that was not meant to be disturbed and now it 's awake . What ? What is awake ? Just tell me what happened up there . Have you heard of Plato 's Cave ? - Heard of what ? - Plato 's Cave . What about it ? He compared us humans to prisoners , chained up in a cave . We 're facing the wall and look at the shadows cast by the fire behind us . What do you think happens when the chains are broken and we look behind us ? When we see what is making the shadows ? We won 't believe what we see . We choose to continue believing the shadows . What 's going on here ? - l have no idea . - What do you mean ? These men were dead . I know that . They arrived in body bags . Their hearts had stopped beating , there was no pulse . We have to get them back to town and run more tests . Could it be some sort of virus ? I can 't say for sure right now . I 've never seen anything like this . No one has . - Where is she ? - Who ? The girl ! She 's in there .

 - I need to talk to you . No , now ! - One moment . Sir , calm down . You 're gonna scare the passengers . They should be scared . This isn 't a panic attack . Aah ! Ladies and gentlemen , we have a passenger who 's having a hard time . Jones , don 't move . That was quite a display you put on in there . Your love for this man must be something quite profound . Goodbye for now . - Walter , my memories are disappearing . - Your own memories ? All of these memories I 'm experiencing , they are from a better version of me . I 've decided to let things run their course . You have so much in your life . Are you just gonna let that all disappear ? I 've made my decision . I 'm in love with Peter . Ladies and gentlemen , we apologize for the delay in our arrival . Weather reports still indicate strong winds and turbulence . We 'll be circling for just a bit longer . We hope to be on the ground within the hour . Thank you for your patience . We 'll be coming through the cabin with snacks which are available for purchase for $ 5 . Remember , Vertus Air no longer accepts cash so please have your credit or debit card handy . - You should put keys on your back . - Excuse me ? It 's an old wives ' tale , to stop the bloody nose . Heh . Yeah ? Actually , I tried it once . It doesn 't work . It 's all bull . Excuse me . Excuse me . Excuse me . - I need to talk to you . - Be with you in one moment . No , now ! Please . - What 's the problem ? - I 'm in trouble . There 's something happening that I don 't have time or permission to explain . - What is it ? - Go to the passengers . Collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can . - Sir , I need you to take a deep breath . - This isn 't a panic attack . This is real . We will die , all of us , if you don 't do what I say . A threat like that is in violation of FAA reg ... - Does it look to you like I care ? - Oh , my God . Go call the captain . I need you to calm down . You 're gonna scare the passengers . I 'm going into that bathroom . You keep me in there , you keep that door closed . Get what sedatives you can as soon as you can . - You go in that bathroom , sir . - I am not messing around . When you get the drugs , you come back , you knock . If I don 't answer or if I do and what you see isn 't me anymore you keep that door closed . Yes , sir , but I think 40 minutes is too long . Ladies and gentleman , we have a passenger who is having a hard time . Sir , this is the air marshal , I need you to open this door . Sir , I won 't tell you again . Open this door or I 'm gonna have to come in . - Panic attack ? - Yeah . Heh . Like I said , I hate flying . I always have , ever since I was a kid . I was doing pretty well until they said we weren 't gonna be able to land for a while . - These your bags ? - Yeah , that 's them . Thank you . - Whoa . - I 'm really sorry . Sorry I wasted your time and scared all those people . Hey . Don 't you have to ask permission before you do that ? Not since Bush 2 . Sure . Sure , whatever . Can we make this quick , please ? - Is there anything I need to be aware of ? - What ? No ? - Knives ? Needles ? - Underwear . Don 't worry , it 's clean , heh . - Are you okay ? - Unh . Aah . Yeah , I just need a bathroom . Right there . Mike . Panic attack , as in withdrawal . Well , time to call the cops . Hey , it 's Knowles . We got drugs again , but nothing I 've ever seen before . You say you 're happy . That you 've never felt better . Yes . And forgetting all the details of your life your relationships , the cases you 've handled that 's , um , not a problem for you ? Well , what I meant ... I mean , yes , it 's odd but it 's a problem I can handle . The real problem , the one we should be worried about , is Jones . - David Robert Jones ? - Yes , the one who kidnapped me . You remember that ? Yes . Because you were already starting to become , what your former self from a prior timeline , the one you shared with Peter Bishop ? I suppose . Yes . My point is , David Robert Jones is still out there somewhere . And instead of pursuing him like I should have I 've been forced to take every psych evaluation and field trial the bureau can think of . I 've had CAT scans , MRIs , peed in every cup . My sitting here now , trying to convince an FBI shrink , no offense that I am fit to return to active duty , is pointless . You have to admit it 's a little weird what 's happened to you . I work in Fringe Division . Weird is a matter of degrees . Have you told your sister ? - You do have a sister , right ? - Yes . Rachel . And no , I haven 't told her . - Are the two of you close ? - Yes . We don 't talk that often . Why not ? Life , heh . My job . She moved back to Chicago with my niece , Ella so that Ella could be closer to Rachel 's ex who , in my opinion , is a liar and a bastard . Just a few more questions , Agent Dunham . We 're almost through . - Hey . - Hey . Sit down . They said no . The truth is , they don 't know what to say . Nothing like this has ever happened . The bureau has protocols for dealing with mental trauma . Depression , post-traumatic stress , amnesia . - I don 't have mental trauma . - I understand that . What does it matter if I can 't remember every detail of every case I 've ever investigated ? I can learn that . It doesn 't make me any less fit to be in the field . Your sister is still married . Rachel is still married . Ella and a younger brother , Eddie . Dr. Anderson sent over her report . Forty percent of all the information you provided about your life is incorrect which as far as the 10th floor is concerned means you are not the agent they licensed . Our grandfather 's name was Eddie . Is that you ? What took you so long ? I was just about to send out a search party . Dogs . Men in trench coats . Oh . That good , huh ? They don 't even want me consulting on cases . I 'm sure that 's temporary . Broyles said I should look at it as an overdue vacation . Why would I assume because you and I are together , everything would be fine ? What , the world isn 't gonna live up to my every expectation ? Maybe a vacation 's not such a bad idea . Vermont 's beautiful this time of year . I know you don 't like skiing but as long as we got a rug and fireplace , we 'll be fine . Heh . You should get that . I think the ' 70s are calling . Yeah ? Yeah , I am , actually . You got that tragic set of charms No , I just wasn 't expecting ... Time spent in Los Angeles Yeah . Lincoln ? Well , one of us is still on the team . - Liv . - Peter , I 'm fine . Go . - I 'll be back as soon as I can . - Okay . Should have surveillance footage . See if they 'll give you access . Yeah , okay . - Hi . - Hey . - How 's Olivia ? - Eh , she 's okay . I think she 's , uh , frustrated , but she 's okay . Broyles asked me to take lead till she 's back . I hope that you 're okay with that . - You 're the boss . So , what happened ? - We 're not exactly sure yet . Incident on Vertus Air , flight from Paris to New York . - Details are still coming in . - Is that Peter ? - Tell him to stay right there . - Did you say Vertus Air ? - Was it Flight 718 ? - Yeah . This is like the timeline I 'm from . It stands to reason some of the same cases would take place . - Vertus 718 ... - Happy birthday ! - Walter , it 's not my birthday . - Of course not , I know that . But I 've been saving these up . I bought one every year on your birthday to help me deal with the loss . Walter . And I know you 're not him , my Peter , but you 're as close as I 'm gonna get . Here we are . Beer . For when you turned 21 . I probably wouldn 't drink that , though . Thank you . You 're welcome . I walked her home and she held my hand I knew it couldn 't be just a one-night stand - So the case on the plane ? - Right , uh , the case on the plane . His name was Marshall Bowman . He was an undercover cop . He was given a designer virus programmed to rewrite his DNA turn him into some kind of creature . - What sort of creature ? A giant porcupine . Plane crashed , he was burned to a crisp . I like porcupines . Shows that God has a sense of humor . Uh , Peter , you were right , the guy 's name is Bowman . - But that flight did not crash . - Huh ? It says it right here . It landed a few hours ago . Sixteen . By then I figured you 'd be all about girls . - Are you sure about that ? - Positive . TSA just sent over the footage . - Oh , my God . - Is that what you were talking about ? Fantastic . Okay , that is disgusting . Learn to see past the obvious , dear . What a remarkable specimen . When was the last time you saw your brother ? A little over a week ago . I don 't understand , some kind of virus ? Why can 't I see him ? I 'm really sorry . Even if I had the authority to do that , which I don 't , it 's not a good idea . I 'm sorry to do this to you right now , but last question , I promise . This is your brother 's handwriting , right ? This bit down here where it says , " Once we get started , there 'll be no turning back . " Do you have any idea what that might be about ? - Maybe who he was writing it to ? - No . But the last couple of times Marshall and I spoke he didn 't seem himself . He was stressed . I thought it was just work . She doesn 't know anything . - Looks like you were right . - About what ? Bowman . Worked out of Credit Cotier in Marseille . Managed corporate accounts . But before that , he was a detective in the BBD crash unit . Retired six years ago , at least officially . Sounds to me like a cop working undercover . - So , what killed this thing ? - Good question . Agents down the hall say they heard the screams . By the time they opened the door , it was on the floor writhing in pain , and then it just died . On the case we worked before he was working with a partner . He was infected too but didn 't know . - Almost transformed days later . - We should find him . Yeah , I 've been trying to think of his name , but I can 't remember it . Olivia would , though . You should give her a call . Daniel Hicks . Olivia says he lives at 235 Marlboro Street . So it should be just up here , a couple more blocks . You wanna talk about it , or should we just pretend like we already did ? Olivia . She 's your Olivia . I get it . I mean , I don 't really get it . How she can suddenly become this other version of herself . Different circumstances , I might think that you were drugging her . Doing something to her , but ... I don 't know if she told you , but when I first met her I had lost my partner . Robert . He and his wife , Julie , they had this incredible relationship . The way she looked at him ... Olivia looks at you that same way . So why don 't we just leave it at that ? You 're a good guy . Yeah . I 'm a good guy . What 's she doing here ? You didn 't really think I 'd stay home , did you ? I suppose not . Olivia , you are not authorized to be here . If Broyles gets wind of this ... Okay . We came all this way . Might as well look around . I 'll check the back . - Medical waste . What 's that about ? - Don 't know . You mean you didn 't see these the last time ? - No . - Huh . Remember you said eventually all of this would stop getting strange ? In case you were wondering , it still hasn 't . You don 't remember having that conversation , do you ? - That night at the diner . - Sorry . It 's okay . - Lincoln . - Is he okay ? I 'm fine . Is that really necessary ? If I don 't suture this wound it will become infested with bacteria . - I was talking about the humming . Oh . Auditory distraction dulls the peripheral senses and allows for optimal focus . Which is why surgeons play classical music in the O.R. - Ow . - Sorry . Hey . Did anyone report seeing the thing that got away ? No word . So do we have any theories why this one died ? Not exactly . Walter thinks that the cells broke down . Rapid mutation caused all the internal organs to fail . What about this ? Also no idea . We 're running labs on it . Try to break down the chemical composition . But check this out . You see these ? They 're track marks . We think he was injecting himself with whatever that stuff is . What 's that ? This here . Hmm . It looks like a tattoo . - Hey , Walter . - Hmm ? Come here , take a look at this . Mm . Hold this . Don 't move . Did you find its genitals , son ? - Hey . - Hey . I 'm sorry about Hicks ' place . I had no idea that he had already become ... - It 's nothing . Don 't worry about it . - But if I hadn 't been with you then you would have called Broyles and asked for backup . You didn 't want to get me in trouble and now you 're injured . It wasn 't your fault . Olivia , I ran that name you gave me . " Conrad Etienne Moreau . " You 're right , he was a scientist . - But he died five years ago in a car crash . - What ? On the case we worked , he was the one trying to broker the deal for the virus that made these guys mutate . You also said Bowman died in a crash . For some reason , the details you and Olivia remember from your timeline not all of them are tracking here . Okay , well , if Conrad 's not behind this , who is ? Perhaps the Sumerians . This tattoo is cuneiform . I 'm not sure of the significance of the symbol but I 'm fairly certain it 's Sumerian . Not my favorite ancient language . I prefer Yiddish . Belly 's father taught it to me . He was a charming man . - You 're thinking something . - You and I know somebody who could help us interpret Bowman 's tattoo . - Who ? - An old friend . Though he may take some convincing . I 'm sure he has no idea who we are . - Sounds intriguing . - Not you . You need to be stitched up . Go . If you learn anything , call me . Okay . Thank you . All set . Enjoy . - Can I help you ? - I hope so . The lady is looking for a book called Lake of the Long Sun by Gene Wolfe . - Do you know him ? - Are you kidding me ? I worship him . And a girl as beautiful as you who likes sci-fi is a girl after my own heart . I 'm Ed , by the way . Olivia . Sorry . Taken . All the best ones are . Story of my life . Okay . I 've got the entire Solar Cycle , first edition . Do you want signed or unsigned ? Do you think maybe he could help ? Who , him ? No , I doubt it . It 's probably a little too obscure . Help what ? Oh , just a symbol we 're trying to decipher . - It has to do with cuneiform . - Sumerian , Hittite or Akkadian ? - Impressive . - I know . I 'm a very , very impressive man . And I 'm still taken . Can 't blame a guy for trying . Do you have any idea what this means ? Are you one of them ? One of who ? - Excuse me ? - It 's Yiddish . It means " May I please be excused from the table ? " - No , you may not . - Why not ? Because I have just made some peanut butter and bacon sandwiches . - Thanks anyway . - And because ... And don 't be alarmed by this , but I think you may be infected . - What ? - Well , if what killed our friend was , in fact , viral , then it 's likely that when you were scratched that the virus was transmitted to you . Okay , um ... Shouldn 't you , like , give me something ? I 'm afraid not . I can 't cure the intermediate stage . Once the virus fully matures , I should be able to counteract it . - Should ? - Most likely . - Eighty percent . - And if I 'm part of the other 20 ? Let 's take it one step at a time . Yup , I was right . Here it is . I remember reading it means " renewal " or " rebirth . " There 's been some rumblings lately about a group out there , a cult , really . - Whereabouts were these rumblings ? - The usual places . Obscure corners of the Internet , conspiracy boards sub-subterranean chat rooms . Far as I can see , they 're just wack jobs . Heh . They 're obsessed with the guided evolution of man . They want to create a new species . A better species . Mutation by design . Oh , baby , you 're hurting . This should be the last one . Just think how special you 're gonna be . How special we 're both gonna be . Like Adam and Eve . Here 's a good one . " According to Mayan prophecies a serpent rope will appear in the center of the Milky Way . " Is that when the world ends ? Apparently , that 's when a celestial ship emerges . A bearded serpent god comes down to bring enlightenment . Actually , the celestial ship turns into the serpent god , if you wanna get technical . - It 's perfect . - Not really . You mean , no mutant porcupine-man ? - Hmm ? - My culture , it 's clear ? Oh , no . No results yet . I was talking about them . I hadn 't realized how much I longed for family . Yeah . They 're ... They 're great . And you too , of course . It 's not every day that a perfectly suited chess partner comes along . And don 't fret . Right now , no news is good news . " Each generation of gods is overthrown by its children who become new gods with new tools . Science delivers these tools . And mankind gains dominion over all he surveys . " What kind of science ? Uh , radical transgenics , hybridization , guided mutation . Most of this is about encoding foreign genomes with retroviral DNA . These algorithms look pretty advanced . " 816TPT618 . " That 's a palindrome . - Or a palindromic code , to be precise . - What 's that mean ? Something that reads the same backwards or forwards . - Words like " madam " or " boob . " - I know what a palindrome is . I meant , what does that mean in terms of the case ? In and of itself , nothing . But years ago , when Belly and I were tripping we created a way of organizing lab files using only palindromes . Walter , are you saying this information comes from Massive Dynamic ? I do recognize the number , but we haven 't used this file system for years . After William died , we converted to a more user-friendly one . Well , maybe it 's from a terminated experiment . We have many projects dealing with the genetic engineering of hybrids . I 'll have to run a search . You weren 't supposed to be here . Phillip said you were pulled off field duty . I know , but here I am . I suppose every version of you is stubborn . Ah , this code does correspond to an old project . But the contents have been erased . Could it have been hacked into ? I don 't see how . The system has eight redundant firewalls . Well , who was overseeing the project ? David Robert Jones . I eat too when I 'm nervous . Don 't worry , we should know something soon . Mm . Mm . I take it you don 't like peanut butter ? Not so much . But this bacon is fantastic . Do you have any more ? Yes . Of course . I typically don 't like pork . Aphid , could we get Agent Lee some more ... ? Agent Lee . What else do you hunger for ? - Pickled herrings ? Spinach ? - I don 't know . Onion rings would be nice , maybe ... Maybe some cheesecake . That 's it . - What ? - Call Peter and Olivia . Tell them that I understand . Walter , what is it ? Astrid said you 've made a breakthrough . Agent Lee is infected . We know for sure now . - We 're excited about that , why ? - He says I 'm gonna be fine . Well , because now I understand what the creature craves to fuel its metamorphosis . - It 's disgusting . - Lipids . Human fat . That 's what was in these bags . Most likely vacuumed during liposuction . Fat stores concentrated energy . And energy is necessary for transformation . Now , I know what you 're asking . Wouldn 't it be easier just to eat people ? Well , the answer , in fact , is no . Not with 300,000 pounds of fat being disposed of by plastic surgery clinics every three months . We need to make a list of all the cosmetic surgery clinics . See if any have had waste stolen . I 'm on it . I 'm thinking they might not be inclined to admit it . Let 's say that you 're right and these things are using fat to power their metamorphosis into monsters . How are they able to get around without being seen ? I really have to drink that ? Only if you want to live . A blend of wheat grass , Penicillin , some mild laxatives and I put in some mint to kill the aftertaste . It didn 't work . - You guys learn anything ? - Yes . I understand what these drugs are for . They 're meant to safely manage the transformation . They 're on a schedule to ensure that the mutation doesn 't occur too quickly . So that 's why Bowman died . He couldn 't get his medicine . He was in the cabin , the drugs were in his luggage . Precisely . Our Mr. Bowman had all the fat he needed to transform . But he lacked the medication to control the process . I used Agent Lee 's infected blood to create a computer model to replicate the mutation sequence . - How 's it coming ? - Good . It 's almost complete . The model just needs to re-create the last few injections . We 've got good news and bad news . Which do you want first ? - Bad . - Good . Walter was right . There was a robbery at a surgi-center outside of Allston 10 days ago . Among other things , half a dozen bags of surgically removed fat were stolen . - Which was that , good or bad ? - Two of the guards were killed . The place has been under lockdown . If they need more fat , they 're gonna have to get it someplace else . The problem is that there are over 45 potential clinics . - What are your thoughts , Walter ? - But I 'm not clear . - Which was the good news ? - Walter ? Take a look at this . How many of those clinics are in high-rises ? Oh , my . In the department of guided evolution this is indeed a great leap forward . Yup , there 's just one . LDP Institute . It 's located in Beacon Hill on the 12th floor . They 're probably closed . We should get a move on . At this point , I have no choice . I need to call for reinforcements . I have to inform Broyles . He 's gonna know that Olivia was working on the case . I just spoke to Broyles . He 'll have backup meet you at the facility . He said he 'd deal with me later , so go . We 're in . Copy . Power has been shut off . Copy that . Going radio silent . Go to NV . Have you heard anything ? I don 't know about you , but this tension 's killing me . Oh . Very clever . He 's using the Sleeping Indian Defense . He saw my rook about to take his queen and he countered with his knight . So , what should I do ? - Walter . - Hmm ? I 'm sorry , my dear . I 'll make less noise . - Shh . - No . What you just said . Porcupines are nocturnal . They sleep during the day . - So do vampires . - Astrid . That 's why Hicks ' windows were all blacked out . - What is it ? - Can we get Lincoln on the radio ? Lincoln , do you copy ? Lincoln , do you copy ? - Hello . - Peter , it 's me . - Yeah , yeah . - Turn on the lights . The creature is nocturnal . If it 's there , the lights might scare it out of hiding . Nice shot . I was aiming for her leg . No ! Do you remember this ? I thought it would teach Peter about magnetism and centripetal force . Oh , Walter . I 'm sure you and Peter will have hours of fun ahead of you . I know . He 'll be so excited . Hey . - Ah . - Oh . I love these things . So how is she ? Uh , Lincoln 's still at the hospital with her , but the doctors say she 's fine . The bullet didn 't cause any permanent damage , and they 're treating the virus . But there is some bad news . She had absolutely no idea who created the serum . It turns out Bowman was the one who obtained it for them . - So more questions . - Yeah , about a thousand more . If David Robert Jones is behind this , what 's he up to ? You mean , assuming that creating a flying human-porcupine hybrid ... - ... was not his end goal . - Yes . Where is he recruiting people from ? Are there more ? Who would sign up to become one of these things ? " And mankind gains dominion over all he surveys . " Yeah , what does that mean ? You said that Jones was a megalomaniac , that he has a God complex . Well , the fact that we 're here at all that humanity evolved from slugs in the ocean depending on who you talk to , is either a miracle or an accident . Maybe Jones is trying to take control of the situation . Agent Broyles . What a lovely tie . Agent Dunham . A word . Look , I 'm sorry that I disobeyed your orders . I shouldn 't have got involved . If I hadn 't , Lincoln would never have been injured . And I get it , there 's a lot that I need to catch up on . So from now on , no matter what , I 'm going to listen to what you say . Are you done ? Yes . I 've been on the phone with the 10th floor for the past hour . What we 've decided is this : If you 're 60 percent of the Olivia I knew you 're still better than 90 percent of the agents I 've ever worked with . A Fringe Division with an Olivia Dunham is better than a Fringe Division without her . - Thank you . - Good work today . Agent . What is it ? You 're having second thoughts . Of course I am . It killed your brother . We have been over this . Something must have gone wrong . - Mel ... - We can be born anew . The two of us . Together . We can be children of the new world . Quiet , you two .

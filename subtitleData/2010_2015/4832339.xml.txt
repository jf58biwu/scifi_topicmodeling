EVEN IF THERE WERE FILES , YOU CAN 'T GO BACK TO HARVARD . WE CAN 'T GET IN . WHY NOT ? IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY OBSERVERS FIVE YEARS AGO . SOME KIND OF BASE OR ... NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY . THE ENTIRE FOUR-MILE RADIUS IS A NO-GO ZONE . WHAT 'S WRONG ? WHY CAN 'T WE GET INTO HARVARD ? IT 'S BEEN TAKEN OVER BY OBSERVERS , WALTER . WELL , AT 'S NOT A PROBLEM FOR SOMEONE WHO 'S DONE ACID . SO ARE THESE BARRIERS AROUND WALTER 'S LAB CHECKPOINTS ? YEAH . NO ONE GETS IN WITHOUT PAPERWORK . TUNNELS . WE DON 'T HE TIME TO DIG TNELS , WALTER , OR THE MANPOWER . WE DON 'T HAVE TO DIG THEM . THEY 'RE ALREADY THERE . STEAM TUNNELS . RIGHT BENEATH US , 2 1 / 4 MILES OF TUNNELS THAT HOUSE THE STEAM PIPES THAT HEAT HARVARD . THEY STRETCH FROM THE CAMBRIDGE ELECTRIC COMPANY PLANT ON WESTERN AVENUE , TO SOLDIERS FIELD , TO THE LAW SCHOOL , TO THE SCIENCE LABS . THEY MADE SURE THE ENTRANCES WERE WELL-HIDDEN . FEW HAVE SEEN THE MYSTERIOUS PASSAGEWAYS . PETER . YAHTZEE . ( guard ) YOUR PAPERS ARE IN ORDER . PLEASE PROCEED .

( Etta ) WHAT ABOUT THE DEVICE I USED TO FREE YOU WITH ? NO , IT WON 'T WORK . THE AMBER 'S TOO THICK . IT 'LL PROBABLY PUSH THE CAMERA FURTHER IN . I NEED A PROPER LASER . WHERE THERE 'S A WILL , COULTHERE 'S A WAY . ? THERE 'S NO POWER . AT ALL . ALL THE AMBERING MUST HAVE BLOWN EVERYTHING . YEAH , WALTER , I THINK IT 'S BLOWN ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE CAMPUS SUBSTATION . WELL , A LASER NEEDS POWER , PETER . THE SUBSTION 'S IN THE BASEMENT OF THE SCIENCE BUILDING . THAT 'S THE ONLY WAY WE 'RE GONNA GET POWER . WE CAN GET THERE USING THE TUNNELS . WELL , WAIT A MINUTE . WE DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF IT 'S THE SCIENCE BUILDING ANYMORE . WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT 'S IN THERE OR WHAT COULD BE WAITING FOR US . WE DON 'T . BUT HE DOES . I 'M SURE HE KNOWS PLENTY . YOU DON 'T SEEM TO TALK MUCH . I 'M GONNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE . WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE SCIENCE BUILDING ? YOU 'RE A REAL OPEN BOOK . IT 'S OKAY . I 'M GOOD AT OPENING BOOKS . WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ? IT 'S NOT IMPORTANT . WHAT 'S IMPORTANT ISHAT I HAVE IT . WHAT DO THEY USE THE SCIENCE BUILDING FOR ? [ shrieks ] I DON 'T THINK YOU WANT TO WASTE ANY MORE PRECIOUS TIME . CRITERION COLLECTION , WALTER , FIT 'S JUST LASER DISC PLAYER . WE NEED THE LASER . PETER . NO , NO . NO , IT SHOULD BE ME . [ chuckles ] WALTER , I DON 'T THINK THIS LASER DISC TUBE CAN GENERATE ENOUGH POWER . WE NEED A BETTER GAIN RATIO . FLYING VERMIN . YOU 'D THINK AFTER 21 YEARS THE OBSERVERS WOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY TO GET RID OF THEM FIRST . OR AT LEAST FOUND A USE FOR THEM . MAYBE FREEZE-DRY THEM AND HAND THEM OUT TO THE POOR AS SUSTENANCE . WE 'RE GONNA NEED A HELIUM-NEON MIX . THERE SHOULD BE ONE OR TWO CANISTERS ... IN THE STORAGE ROOM OFF MY OFFICE . I 'LL GET THEM . [ whimpering , grunting ] ( Etta ) I 'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN . WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE SCIENCE BUILDING ? ETTA ? WH ARE YOU DOING ? IT 'S CALLED AN ANGEL DEVICE . IT STIRS UP AND DESTABILIZES EVERY ATOM IN HIS BODY . FULL-CHARGE STEALS AROUND 25 , 30 YEARS . BUT THIS IS A LONG WAY FROM A FULL CHARGE . HE 'S SO DISORIENTATED BY THE PROCESS HE LOSES THEILL TO LIE . OR HE HOLDS OUT UNTIL HIS HEART FAILS . BUT MO OF THEM GIVE US WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW . WHATRE YOU DOING ? AND IF TI 'M GIVING HIM WATER . YOU WANT TO KILL HIM , GO AHEAD . THAT 'S HOW YOU 'LL DO IT . HE CAN 'T HAVE WATER YET . NOT FOR ANOTHER THREE HOURS . HE 'S NOT WORTH A SINGLE TEAR . LOYALISTS SELL OUT THEIR OWN KIND LIKE RATS . I KNOW YOU JUST WOKE UP , BUT LOOK AROUND YOU , MOM . CAN 'T YOU SEE WHAT THE OBSERVERS HAVE BROUGHT ? THIS IS WAR . AND WE 'RE LOSING . ( Walte ETTA ! I 'LL BE GHT BACK . JUST DON 'T GET TOO NEAR HIM . WALTER , WHAT 'S UP ? DON 'T YOU WEAR A NECKLACE ?

LIKE YOU 'RE IN PAIN . YOU KNOW , MY ABSENCE WON 'T GO UNNOTICED . I DON 'T BELIEVE THAT ANYBODY 'S COMING TO LOOK FOR YOU . SEE , I DON 'T THINK THAT YOU 'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WERE SEEN OR BECAUSE WE TRIGGERED SOME SORT OF ALERT . I THINK THAT YOU CAME HERE TO FEED THE BIRDS . LOOK , I 'M GUESSING YOU 'RE TO BE IN THIS BUILDING , S SO EVEN IF YOU ARE MISSED , THIS WOULD BE THE LAST PLACE ANYBODY WOULD LOOK . YOU NEED TO TELL HER WHAT SHE WANTS TO KNOW NOW . YOU NEED TO TELL HER BEFORE YOU GET WORSE . YOU 'VE ALREADY LOST YEARS OF YOUR LIFE . NOW COME ON . YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR . I 'M TRYING TO HELP YOU . YOU DON 'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT . DO YOU ? WELL , WHAT AUTHORITY DO I NEED ? YOU KNOW A LOYALIST JUST DOESN 'T WALK AWAY WHEN THEY 'VE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE RESISTANCE . HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE ? WHERE ARE YOU FROM ? WHY ? I 'VE BEEN AROUND LOT LONGER NEW THAN YOU MAY THINK . RESISTANCE . LOOK ... I 'M NOT GONNA SURVIVE THIS . AND I 'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE , SO I WILL TELL HER WHAT SHE NEEDS TO KNOW IF YOU WILL GO AND TELL MY SON I 'M T COMING HOME ... AND THAT I LOVED HIM VERY MUCH . I DON 'T WANT HIM TO KEEP LOOKING FOME .

WHAT KIND OF RUMORS ? EXPERIMENTS . ON WHAT ? ON EVERYTHING . MY ACCESS CODE IS A TWOART CODE . THE FIRST PART IS 010567 . AND THE SECOND PART ? ME . CAN WE BEAT AN OCULAR SCANNER ? WE HAVE HIS CODE TO ACCESS THE BUILDING , BUT THERE ARE SCANNERS AT EVERY POINT . ( Peter ) WELL , THAT DIDN 'T TAKE LONG . WHAT 'S WRONG ? ( Peter ) WHERE DID THIS COME FROM ? BARBARIC . WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TO ? HOW COULD THE RESISTANCE CREA SUCH A DEVICE ? WE DIDN 'T . THLOYALISTS DID . IT 'S OLD SECOND-GEN OBSERVER TECH . IT WAS DESIGNED TO PREPARE OBSERVERS FOR TIME TRAVEL . BUT , AS YOU CAN SEE , THE LOYALISTS FIGURED OUT A NEW WAY TO USE IT ON US . NO REASON WE SHOULDN 'T USE IT ON THEM . [ whistles blow ] [ shouts , vehicle approaching ] IT 'S JUST A TRANSPORT UCK . WE 'RE OKAY . WELL , AS FAR AS OCULAR SCANNERS GO , UCK . THE ONLY SUREFIRE WAY IS TO BRING HIM WITH YOU . IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . LOOK AT HIM . I 'M GONNA LOOK AT YOUR EYE . AND , IF YOU CAN 'T BRING HIM WITH YOU , THERE 'S ONLY ONE WAY . I AGREE . WALTER , YOU CAN 'T . OF COURSE I CAN . RATHER EASILY FT . ASTRIL , I 'M GONNA NEED A SHARP SCALPEL AND MY LONG-HANDLED STAINLESS SPOON . [ grunts ] I 'LL NEED ANOTHER . PAY ATTENTION TO THE TEXTURE . MAKE SURE IT 'S SPONGY . YOU KNOW , THE VIETNAMESE CONSIDER PIGS ' EYES TO BE A DELICACY . EVEN ONES THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING IN FORMALDEHYDE FOR 20 YEARS ? YES , THAT SHOULD DO NICELY . ARE YOU SURE THIS WILL WORK , WALTER ? " IN A PIG 'S EYE . " I WONDER WHAT THE ORIGIN OF THAT TERM- - WALTER . [ grunts ] CERTAINLY . AN IRIS IS LIKE A FINGERPRINT . EACH HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE PATTERN . AND , IF WE CAN MIMIC THAT PATTERN , WE CAN TRICK THE SCANNER INTO THINKING THAT THIS PIG 'S EYE IS OUR TATTOOED FRIEND THERE . THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SO MUCH . IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTANIT . I 'M NOT SURE I WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT . NOT BAD . YEAH ? YOU 'RE NEXT . HOW 'S HE DOING ? HE 'S GETTING THERE . THANK YOU . FOR WHAT ? WHEN I SAID IT WAS LOGICAL FOR ME TO GO TURN THE POWER ON INSTEAD OF YOU . THAT I KNOW PROTOCOL IF SOMETHING GOES OFF TRACK AND THAT PETER SHOULD GO BECAUSE HE 'S THE ENGINEER .

WE 'LL FIND OUT . [ background chatter ] [ elevator beeps ] GENTLEMEN . WHY DOES SOMEONE JOIN THE LOYALISTS ? PAIN . THERE WERE RESISTANCE FIGHTERS NEAR MY BUILDING . THEY WERE GONNA BLOW UP A CITY BUS FULL OF THEM . INVADERS . MY CHILDREN WERE OUTSIDE . ONE OF THEM WAS KILLED . MYLDT BOY . I 'M SORRY . I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT LOSING A CHILD . SO , AFTER THAT MOMENT , I JUST WANTED TO BE SAFE . YOU KNOW , I WAS ANGRY AT THE RESISTANCE IT 'S HOPELESS . I DO TH JOB . THEY GIVE US A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE , GET TAKEN CARE OF , THEY LOOK AFR US . AND I DON 'T HAVE TO WORRY , AT LEA ABOUT MY BOY . I ' NEVER UNDERSTAND YOU PEOPLE . YOU CAN 'T WIN . THE WORLD WOULD BE A MUCH SAF PLACE IF YOU JUST STOPPED TRYING TO FIGHT THEM .

( Etta ) SIMON . ETTA ? ETTA , NO , NO , STOP , STOP . WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WE HAVE TO KEEP ON MOVING . THINK OF THE TAPE . THINK ABOUT WHAT 'S ON IT . THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE . THERE WILL BE A TIME FOR VENGEANCE AND A TIME FOR GRIEVING , BUT IT IS NOT NOW . STOP . STOP . THEY 'LL PAY FOR WHAT THEY 'VE DONE . I PROMISE . ( Manfretti ) DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN WIN ? WELL , WE HAVE TO WIN . SO THAT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT DIED , INCLUDING YOUR SON , DIDN 'T DIE FOR NOTHING . NOW . [ music playing ] LET THERE BE LIGHT .

HE 'S USELESS TO US NOW . I 'M TURNING HIM OVER TO THE RESISTANCE . ( Olivia ) HE SAYSHE 'S USELESS NO ONE EVER COMES BACK.US NOW . AND RESISTANCE FIGHTERS DON 'T COME BACK WHEN THEY 'RE TAKEN IN BY LOYALISTS . HQ WILL GET WHATEVER ELSE THEY CAN FROM HIM AND DISPOSE OF HIM , AND THE WORLD WILL BE A TINY BIT SAFER . ( Olivia ) LOOK , I KNOW YOU 'RE UPSET RIGHT NOW , BUT HE DID GIVE US THE CODE . YEAH , OF COURSE HE DID . IT 'S NATURAL HUMAN INSTINCT . TO LIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE . IT 'S THE SAME QUALITY THEY USE TO TURN US INTO SLAVES . HE JOINED THEM IN ORDER TO PROTECT WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIS FAMILY , YOU KNOW , HIS SON . HE 'S A LIAR . THAT 'S WHAT THEY 'RE TRAINED TO DO . HE HAS NO SON . HE GAVE YOU THE CODE BECAUSE HE SAW IN YOUR ES WEAKNESS . HE SAW IN YOUR EYES THAT YOU CLD BE MANIPULATED , THAT MAYBE , MAYBE HE COULD CONVINCEOUO LET HIM GO . BUT THAT 'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN , SWEETHEART . ETTA , I UNDERSTAND HOW HURT YOU MUST BE . YOU DON 'T KNOW MY WORLD . YOU 'RE RIGHT . I DON 'T KNOW YOUR WORLD . BUT I HAD HOPED FOR YOU THAT , WHEREVER YOU WERE , YOU WEREN 'T HARDEDBY WHAT HAD H. AND IT 'S NOT THAT I DON 'T SEE WHAT THE OBSERVERS VE BROUGHT , I DO .

I KEEP MY WORD . I KNOW YOU DO . WALTER . I NEED A SEDATIVE . [ murmurs ] THAT CAN BE ARRANGED . [ door opens ] THAT 'S A COMM DEVICE . IF WALTER NEEDS ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE LASER , I 'LL BE ABLE TO GET IT FOR HIM . THERE YOU ARE . YOU DON 'T HAVE A SON , DO YOU ? NO . I WAS HOPING , RIGHT UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE , THAT SHE COULD SOMEHOW CONVINCE YOU . YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT ME . I BECAME A LOYALIST BECAUSE I 'M A COWARD . GET OUT OF HERE . I 'M GONNA FIGHT . FOR THE RESISTANCE . I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT . YOU DON 'T HAVE TO LIE ANYMORE . I ALREADY LET YOU GO . WELL , THAT 'S WHY THIS TIME I 'M HOPING YOU BELIEVE ME . I MEAN , THIS CAN COME IN USEFUL . THERE AREN 'T MANY RESISTANCE FIGHTERS WITH AN ACTIVE TAT I.D. YOU SAID I SAW SOMETHING IN HER EYES . YOU WERE RIGHT . THERE WAS A CERTAINTY THAT I 'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE , AND I DON 'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT OTHER THAN TO SAY I FELT ... FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO WIN . WHY ARE YOU LETTING ME LIVE ? SOMETHING THAT I SAW IN HER EYES AS WELL . PITY . PITY FOR WHO ? FOR ALL OF US . GOT IT . IT LOOKSIKE THE HEAT FROM THE LASER MIGHT HAVE DAMAGED THE PVC . IT MIGHT HAVE DAMAGED THE TAPE . I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD HAVE GONE SLOWER . WHOEVER YOU ARE , IF YOU FOUND THIS TAPE , YOU 'VE RETRIEVED IT FROM AMBER . IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS , THEN YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE OBSERVERS HAVE INVADED . I AM MOST PROBABLY DEAD , AND UNFORTUNATELY MY PLAN TO STOP THEM HAS FAILED . I HAVE DOCUMENTED ALL THE PARTS OF THELAN ON VIDEOTAPES . YOU MUST RECOVER EACH TAPE AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON EACH OF THOSE TAPES TO RETRIEVE ALL THE PARTS OF THE PLAN . ONCE YOU DO SO , WHAT YOU NEED TO DO WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU . IF SUCCESSFUL , THIS PLAN WILL RESTORE US AND RID THE WORLD OF THE OBSERVERS . YOU WERE CHOSEN FOR THIS . THIS IS YOUR DESTINY . I UNDERSTAND IF YOU 'RE FRIGHTENED . IT WILL NOT BE EASY , BUT I TRUST THAT THE SAME WILL THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE WILL KEEP YOU GOING . IT- - GENTLE , PETER . [ comm device beeps ] I 'M ON MY WAY BACK . OKAY . ( Peter ) HERE WE GO . BUT I TRUST THAT THE SAME WILL THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE WILL KEEP YOU GOING . IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU FOLLOW THE TAPES . YOMUST BEGIN THIS JOURNEY RIGHT AWAY . YOU ARE HUMANITY 'S ONLY HOPE . NOW YOU MUST RETRIEVE THE FIRST TAPE .

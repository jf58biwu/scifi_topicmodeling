 A brain Injury caused her to lapse Into I coma . Trapped inside your own brain . Too expensive , and insurance won 't cover it . The Jefferson Institute is one of only two facilities in the entire country that specializes in the care of patients in an advanced vegetative state . The institute can house these patients for a fraction of what it would cost a conventional hospital . Jefferson wouldn 't let us in . Come on . So we broke in . Room after room , empty . What kind of hospital has no bodies ? What we did find , we can 't explain . Then the guards came . - Hey , hey , stop - Hurry . - Come on ! - Go ! Thanks , hon . - Just in time . - Here you go . Good morning , everyone . - Sweet . - Gang , lot ' : rock and roll . Watch the game last night , Chambers ? Fourth quarter . Wild one . In fact , Dr. Taylor ' : got season tickets . How was It , Doc ? My son-in-law used them . You know how It ls . Never enough time In the day . I don 't think I 've seen one game this year . I got Muck at an ethics board meeting , than a fundraiser . Caught the last two minutes on the ride home , though . All right , that is the last of the fibroids . And we 're good . Losing a lot of blood , Doc ? Not more than 100 cc 's . Nice color , very nice . Why ? Pressure is 80 / 58 , dropping . Turn the music off . What ? How can that be ? I don 't know . Give me a second . - It ' : not coming from me . - This doesn 't make any sense . I ... - Talk to me , Ramirez . - Heart rate is out of whack . Eyes ? Fixed and dilated . I 'm showing zero brain activity . Damn it . You ! I 'm talking to you . - What are you doing ? - This has got to stop ! Okay . Okay . It 's okay . I was doing nothing ! He came at me ! You saw him . Dr. Taylor , just the man I 'm looking for . You got a second ? - Don 't lot them got to you , Mark . - Sr ? - HI , honey . How ' : work ? - Hay , Dad . Is it fair that I 'm working at the hospital and here ? The people are going to rise up one day . I didn 't pick my parents , you know . I 'll do the grocery shopping this week , okay ? Yeah , you 'd better unless you want us surviving on berries and worms . Susan ! Miss , can you hear me ? Can you hear me ? There you go . Are you okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Good , good . - Mom . - Call 911 . - Thanks . - You 're vary welcome . Anyway , it was so scary . I thought I was going to have to find myself a new roommate . I know . And the weirdest part was opening my eyes and having some strange guy over me . That was weird for you ? Speaking of which , looks like someone 's trying to get your attention . - Okay . - I 'll take the guy from the pool any day . Come on . You 've got good eyes . That 's why I 'm going into ophthalmology . Seriously , you want mo to got the number of the mouth-to-mouth guy ? - No , don 't you dare . Don 't . - Come on . I can break in his locker at the pool , tell you if he wears boxers or briefs . Don 't worry . You 'll do great . I 'm on six if you need me . Montoya ? I 'm Paul Carpin . I 'm a medical student . I 'm supposed to report to the head nurse . Sylvi , lady In 514 yanked out her line again . Yeah , bye . - Someone find Cartwright . - Nurse , I need some help . - HI . Is this the surgical rotation ? - Did you find him yet ? What 's her problem ? That ' : actually considered pleasant for Montoya . - Okay . - And yes , this ls the surgical rotation . - New student ? - Transfer from New York . Hey , guys . Hi . You , how is your head ? It 's better . Thanks . Good . I 'm glad . My name ls Mark Bellows . I know you . From the Georgia Yacht Club . Paul Carpin , sir . Good to see you . Call me Mark . In front of patients , Dr. Bellows . - Hanna Goldberg . - HI , Hanna . - Geoffrey Fairweather . - HI . - Susan Wheeler . - You 're the Wheeler . Like , as in this building , the Wheeler Pavilion ? Townes Wheeler performed the very first open-heart surgery in Atlanta . - My grandfather . - That we : beck when they named buildings to honor people , not jun to shake them down . Well , welcome , Susan . A legacy will get you In , but only herd work will keep you here . Okay , show of hands , how many of you are absolutely certain that you want to be surgeons ? Congratulations . You screwed up already . They didn 't tell you ? Never do your first rotation in your chosen field . Use the ones you don 't re about to gain experience . Follow me . We can transfer her to a private room ... Hi . Hi . You all right ? I don 't know where I am . Okay . Okay , let me see . Okay , Mrs. Danner , I 'm sure somebody will be here any second . You just breathe . Okay , guys , there is a liver resection happening in OR 4 , so let 's go . I 'm coming . Okay , kids , showtime . They said I had Alzheimer 's , and I don 't , and they loft mo out here . Okay , I 'm here with you now , right ? Okay , Mrs ... - Danner . - Danner . We 're going to take you downstairs now . Listen , I don 't want to cause any trouble or anything , but I just don 't think she should be left alone . Okay , sure . Hey , Geoffrey , could you help me out here for a second ? Yeah . - What did you need ? - Could you jun hand mo one of those scrub brushes up there ? You 're tall . Thanks . Sorry to keep you waiting . How have you been feeling ? Have you been taking your medication ? Would you say I 've boon helpful to you , Arno ? I feel like I 've been very protective toward you , maybe too protective . No . Have you been seeing the trees ? The trees ain 't real . I make the trees in my dreams . The girl ain 't real , either . Fair weather , do a neuro check . Hi , Mrs. Sands . This is Dr. Bellows . You 're looking wall . Guys , the patient ' : name ls Marla Sands . She was brought in on the 21st with nausea , fatigue , weakness and vomiting . - Susan . Would you like to do the honors ? - Sure . Mrs. Sands , this la gonna take re of your nausea , okay ? I find that If you pinch the patient 's arm , they barely feel a thing . - Here you go - Okay . - I 'm sorry . - Geez , I got It . If you drop it , they won 't feel it at all . Don 't worry . It happens to the bani of us , Susan . Here you go . - Simple . - Very good . Follow me . Sorry , you have to leave now . The surgical team 's doing rounds late . - Sorry . - That ' : okay . Okay , 9 " VS Oh , my God . I know her . Susan ? I see her at the pool . What happened to her ? She was diagnosed with simple fibroid tumors . After a successful hysteroscopy , she lapsed into a coma . Common procedure . Incidents of coma after anasthesia are one In 0,000 . Now , I was not there for this case , but I have been in the room when it 's happened before , and trust me , it 's not something you ever want to experience . In three days , her coverage for hospital re will end . Jefferson is the only facility your insurance will approve for long-term care . Honestly , Mrs. Greenly , your daughter will receive more attention and have a better chance of recovering at ... At Jefferson . Hey . I used to see her at the pool . Yeah , she loves swimming . Or loved swimming . She seems so nice , and , you know , I know she didn 't deserve this . I mean , not that anyone deserves this , but ... Well , it 's what you people did to her . She was perfectly healthy . Friend of yours or something ? That 's Nancy Greenly 's fiance . I 'm just trying to understand it . How do I got access to her admittance record and surgical chart ? You can 't , honey . Hospital guidelines restrict students ' access to the records . And the op report la not available In the chart yet . Anyone asks , I 'll tell them you stole my ID . Okay , what if I want to look up other cases like hers ? You can narrow your total down by length of stay , but after that , you still have to go through it one case at a time . - Okay . - We missed you lat night . The entire board was there . I had patient tor open some sutures I couldn 't gal away . Get your priorities straight , Mark . If the board doesn 't think you 're serious , they 'll go with another candidate . Come on , admit it , you only wanted me there to help you push through the the next phase of your Alzheimer 's study . Yes . But I also like you , and I 'm trying to help you . And , yes , Stark fails to see the value of my study . Well , I 'll be there next week , scout 's honor . I appreciate everything you 're doing for me . Hey , Susan . Listen . When I ask you to join mo In the operating room , hero ' : the thing , I 'm not really asking you , I 'm toiling you . That patient needed someone to stay with her ... I understand , but this is a factory , and if you walk away from the assembly line , there will be consequences , okay ? And you can 't get attached to every patient that comes in here . If you do , you won 't last long . Let 's leave that for the nurses and the families and the volunteers , okay ? Thanks . And , Susan ? You should have lot Fairweather pus out In the OR . He wouldn 't have done the same thing for you . Why are there so many comas ? I don 't know . I mean , it seems like a lot , doesn 't it ? Only coma cases go to Jefferson , right ? I 'll leave a note for the head nurse . She can ask the doctors to look into it . Go home . Hey , Nancy . How is it out there ? Rowdy as ever . Same as usual . - See you later - Bye . There have always been two types of doctors , those who attend the ill and those who research in the hope of curing all ills . The cost of quality care versus the cost of research , and both , sadly , are addicted to profit . Through research , we n discover cures for many Illnesses , making the human race itself healthier ... The remodeling ls not until next year , Mr. Fairweather . - Yes , sir . Sorry . - Thank you . Now , is it ethical to spend a smaller amount on those loss likely to benefit from a procedure or ls It better to sacrifice ... - You look exhausted . - I know . I haven 't been home . ... that patient and his well-being for the greater good of the community . Notes ? Mr. Fair weather . If we can 't cure , aren 't we only really biding time until the inevitable ? Yeah , and who decides ? The doctor , the patient or the Insurer ? Well , obviously , we 're the only ones in a real position to evaluate the chances of success versus the ultimate cost . Excellent questions for next week 's class . Susan , I 'm so glad you came . Your grandfather would be proud . You had a question . Isn 't It our job to do what ' : bani for our patients ? Yes . But the Irony Is that we have done our job too well , and we live in an aging society . Is it right to devote resources to those who will succumb to some ailment or other , or ls It sensible to discover cures for your children so they 'll have better lives ? So Stark does this every year just to prove how much money he has ? Stark doesn 't take a cent from Memorial . Really ? The Stark : were bankers . Almost totally wiped out by the Civil War . They lost a bundle in loans against slaves . Mortgaging human beings ? Quaint . Divorced 12 years ago , not long after his daughter died of juvenile diabetes . No family left . Ho lives all alone In what ' : practically a castle . If I 'm gonna marry this guy , I think I 'm allowed to Google him . Wish me luck . Okay . Good luck . Quadruple bypass , ' 06 . Quack : at Marcy didn 't give ma a chance . I wouldn 't be standing here today had it not been for Stark . One hell of a doctor . You sure this isn 't a fundraiser ? Every time you throw a party , it costs my clients a fortune . I think we 've made your clients more than they 'll ever be able to give away . But they didn 't even call you in for a review ? I 'm not going to call myself in for a review . Yeah , but a coma ? Are you kidding me ? Nelson thought I took too long stitching up a hernia . Ho had mo In front of the ethics board the next day . - Hay . - How you doing ? Did you hit that yet ? No , I did not . But go for It , knock yourself out . Could be the fastest way to the top . - Have another drink , Chandler . - I 'mjust saying . - Nice party , huh ? - Yes . We should have more events like this . I think it 's important to remember , especially as a student , that there is life outside the hospital . A life ? I 'm still trying to figure out when I 'm supposed to sleep . I thought you were doling that during surgery . You 'll have to excuse him , Dr. Lindquist . Paul 's a little on the competitive side . We 're wired to compete . Our ancestors competed for food , for shelter , for mates . And those who couldn 't didn 't survive . Yeah , it 's how we distinguish the best from the rest , Fair weather . Best from the rest . Well , it rhymes , so it must be true . Fool , tool . See ? I did it , too . Hey , Susan . Over here . Have you met Susan Wheeler ? This is one of the smartest students we have . Susan , this is Dr. Lindquist . She 's the head of psychiatry - with e PhD In Neuroscience . - HI . Wow . A brain surgeon who knows what you 're thinking . - What field do you hope to go In , Susan ? - Neurosurgery . Well , it 's always nice to have fresh blood . If you make the cut . Welcome to Memorial . That was , like , really intense , right ? You think ? I was dying . Say the wrong thing to the wrong department head , you end up in proctology . And Carpin was really into her . Yeah , well , he 's an elitist and a sociopath . Mon doctors ere only one or the other . He ' : the whole package . Most likely to succeed . Yeah . I 'm not really sure I 'm fitting in here . You don 't . Trust me . I don 't , either . You 're smart , you 're nice . These people are monsters . They 're Southerners . I 'm gonna get another drink . You want one ? No . I 'm fine , thank you . Is this seat taken ? Sure . No , it 's not . Thanks . I never properly thanked you for saving my life the other day . No , you didn 't . Are you going to now ? Did you know Nancy Greenly ? It 's hard to believe , right ? Yeah . It 's really scary . I better go check on my roommate . That sounds like a good idea . Make sure she 's still standing upright . - I 'll no you tomorrow . - Okay . You look too young to be a doctor . That 's ' cause I 'm a med student . That 's why you look so tired . I was beginning to think it was my fault . Actually , you can 't use that in here . Sorry . It ' : okay . There ' : something wrong with It anyway . - What ' : that ? - Your number Isn 't In It . It says there were some tests ordered here , but there 's no doctor listed . It just says , " Admin . " It 's probably Dr. Anything-for-a-buck , M.D. Anyone mention what these tests were for ? Who knows ? Dr. Cartwright did the surgery on my knee last time . I mean , what do you test for when you have torn ligaments anyway ? So , you 're not married or engaged or anything , ere you ? So , the only medication you 're taking is ibuprofen ? Usually in the morning . You know what you need ? And no allergies to any medications , as far as you know ? No . Which knee is it ? - Right knee . - Right knee . Right knee . I 've got this place on the Sound . It 's beautiful this time of year , and empty . You could come down and just stare at the water . Do you wear dentures , partial or full , or have any dental implants ? Is that ayes ? Hey . May I use your ID ? It 's all yours . At the Institute , we rely on the most advanced techniques modern medicine has to offer to ensure our patients ' comfort . What 's that ? Our business is caring . It 's just some link I got by accident , I guess . Guess who just assisted Bellows and McLeary . Yeah ? Great . Our business is caring , caring for patients , caring for families , caring for the future . That ' : what the Jefferson Institute ls all about . - Jefferson . - Yeah . I 've just been kind of curious . Do you know about this place ? An uncle of mine got Into a construction accident and landed in a coma . He ended up there a few years ago . My mom was ready to pull the plug , but they took hm . I only visited once . It reminded me of a hotel . Or like a giant funeral home . Is he still in there ? I 'm not even sure . The Jefferson Institute is one of only two facilities in the entire country that specializes in the care of patients in an advanced vegetative state . The institute can house these patients for a fraction of what it would cost a conventional hospital . Jefferson wouldn 't let us in . So we broke in . Room after room , empty . What we did find , we can 't explain . Then the guards came . - Hurry . They 're coming . - Go , go , go ! Let 's get out of here . - Can help you ? - HI . I 'm a medical student at Memorial . I 'm wondering if I could have the tour . So sorry to have kept you waiting . We only conduct tours that have been arranged by hospitals or medical schools . I didn 't realize . Well , since I 'm here , there 's someone I 'd like to visit . - Family ? - No , she ' : a friend . Nancy Greenly ? Oh , my , no . Sorry . You would need permission from the patient 's life guardian . Well , she was someone I knew , and she came into the hospital . I 'm a third-year med student . I 'll speak to my advisor . Thank you , ma 'am . Oh , my God . I remember you . Susan , right ? Very funny . I 'm mooting Anna and Lizbeth at MoCugh 's . You 're coming . No , I can 't . I 'm trying to study the coma rate at Memorial . You know , it 's nine cases in just a few months . - You want one ? - No . It ' : different doctors , different procedures . It ' : different times of day . And I lost access to the records . Why ? This nurse on the floor , Montoya , she was helping me , and then she just quit . I don 't think she quilt . A nurse on your ﬂoor Mole a patient ' : iPod . - Montoya ? - Yeah , I think so . They found it in her bag . Tell you what . I 'll get you the records if you do something in return . How do you have access to records ? They don 't care in Ophthalmology . They log in in the morning , and anyone can look at anything they want to . Okay , what do you want me to do ? Just give me a list of what you need , - and other come hang out with mo or ... - Or what ? Or hang out with Dr. Bellows . He can help . You have his number , don 't you ? Yes , he gave it to us , but ... If he gave It to you , than you n use It . He ' : cute . Have dinner . Talk shop . See what else comes up . Oh , no . You could turn that thing off when you 're hero , you know . I 'm a doctor , remember ? How did she get your number ? She is entirely too young for me . He 's a politician . I 'm still jealous , though . " Baby , don 't be jealous . No , she means nothing to me . " This isn 't personal . I 'm sure she 's just calling about the Greenly case . That 's the procedure Dr. Taylor did the day that he killed himself . I tried to talk to him that day . Brushed mo off . - You didn 't tell mo you saw him . - Yeah . I know how much he meant to you . Survivor depression is very common in grieving families and friends , you know . " Was there something I could have done ? " " Was there one thing that I could have said ? " Dr. Nelson told ma that Taylor ' : health was falling . - Heart . - I didn 't know . And who knows what was going on with his family , with his wife , his kids . - Yeah . - With his grandkids . - Absolutely . - I 'll no you there . Mark . What are you doling ? We got the surgery In 10 minutes . I know . Listen . I went to Jefferson , and for a place that houses only technically dead patients , they make it very difficult to get in . You don 't really have time for side projects . They said I would need you to arrange a tour for me . This is your surgical rotation . You really want to and up In Memorial or not ? I found eight other recent come es beside Nancy Greenly 's . - Well , it 's a big place . - In four months . That 's 10 times higher than the average for the same number of surgeries . If that ' : true , the hospital ' : already looking Into It . It ' : not something they 're going to send e memo out about . Where did you get those numbers ? I looked at the transfers to Jefferson . I don 't know If It ' : procedure or equipment or some particular doctor , but you have access to those surgical records . I mean , maybe ... How did you got access to the admittance and the discharge files ? Montoya . I think you may have helped get her fired . So , young man , which knee is it ? It 's the right . - Susan ? - Yeah . Hay . There you are . So , did you think about my offer ? Como down to the ocean , ﬂare at the waves , wind In your hair ? Sean , I think you know how I feel about those baby blues , so you do not want to make me jealous . Now , my fifth anniversary ls tomorrow . Should I get her perfume ? Now , that 's original . Speaking of , is someone wearing perfume ? Yeah , it 's mine , Mark . Do you like it ? Never wear perfume in the OR , okay ? Might as well light a cigarette . What is five ? I know first is paper . Wood , I think . Right ? Five is wood ? So I can get her a pair of wooden clogs . That would make me sign on for another five years . I hear you . All right , heart rate is climbing . It 's over 100 . His heartbeat ' : at 120 . Maybe we should have done the NueroBloc . - Turn the music off , please . - Come on , Connor , can you keep this guy asleep for me , please ? I think he 's breathing on his own . What 's going on ? Is he gonna be all right ? You don 't ... BP ls In the tank , GU36 . Call my attending Okay , what the hell 's going on here ? Get the crash cart , please . Yes , sir . This can 't be happening . This guy 's totally healthy . Start compression . He ' : arrested . I 'm giving Epi . I know , I can see that , damn it . Look , get a crash cart in here . Somebody call a code . - Hurry UP - - Go , go , go - Gal the rt In here ! - Come on , come on . Como on ! You should go home . Get some sleep . What happened ? You were there . We did everything right . The hospital will review what happened to see if any mistakes were made , and why his body reacted the way that ... He had the same surgery two years ago . Same anesthesia , and he did not go into a coma because of some reaction . Susan , I 'm sorry . Hi . I 'm Susan Wheeler . Sure , Mark 's student . I 'm Ramirez . Have a seat . I saw your name in Nancy Greenly 's file , and I was hoping you might tell mo about what happened . - Why ? - I know her . I we : the one who took her hand from her fiance before we rolled her into the OR . And I was the one who told him she wasn 't gonna wake up . What do you think ? Do you think she had a make ? And the procedure itself , was there anything unusual ? Was her blood a lot darker ? Which would indicate a loss of oxygen to the brain ? No . If anything , it was brighter . Her color was fine . Her labs were fine , no problems with the surgery at all . What did the surgeon think about what happened ? Did you speak to him afterward ? The surgeon ? Dr. Taylor went home and hung himself . Did you drop this ? Hey , you got these . I can 't believe you did it . Jen ? Wake up . - Hay . What ' : going on ? - Hay . I got those files you wanted . I know . I saw . Thank you . Where did this come from ? What is it ? I don 't know . It was on the floor . Was somebody in here ? The landlord said he was gonna come by and fix the light over the sink . I heard what happened in surgery . Sorry . I got to go to bed . Mark Bellows , right ? Yeah , that 's me . James Harper . Yeah , I remember you . You 're Reglne Harper ' brother , right ? She 's finally dead . Oh , God , I 'm sorry to hear that . I didn 't know that . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! - Is everything ell right , Mr. B ? - Yeah . No , Lawrence . 'We 're okay . We just ... A little misunderstanding . It ' : fine . - Are you sure ? - I 'm sure . Thank you , though . Thank you . At Jefferson , they ... They cremated her . I picked her ashes up this morning . My mother has Alzheimer 's . She doesn 't have much time left . The last thing she needs is your damn blood money . I want you to take this , and I want you to shove It up the use : of every nurse and doctor who was there that day . Going through old cases , Mark ? I believe it was my first rotation , - I heard it from you . - Heard what ? 'A good doctor never ﬂop : looking for answers . ' - I never actually thought you were listening . - I wasn 't . - The Harper 0 . - Yeah . - Find anything ? - No . I came to commend you on one of your students , Paul Carpin . Ho assisted Dr. Gloxon yesterday I was In the room . Eager to learn , good hands , vary professional . That ' : fantastic . Thank you , sir . I 'll pus It on to him . Ho stands In contrast to another one of your students . You have explained the concept of patients ' rights to privacy ? - Sir ... - Searching for answers ls one thing . Violating patients ' rights is another . Susan Wheeler , I 'm not sure you 've met . This ls Dr. Nelson . He ' : the head of anesthesiology . One of my interns , Dr. Ramirez , told me that you were questioning him ? Is there some level of expertise of which we are unaware ? I 'm sorry . I was only asking . I 'll be In touch with the university s to your conduct . Dr. Nelson , in fairness , sir , I think she 's upset about the Berman case . Personally , this is the second case I 've been involved in that ended in an unexplained coma . You know vary well that a hospital has a rigid chain of command . Leave the investigation to those who have the data . That ' : their job . Susan Wheeler Isn 't here to interrogate my doctors . She ' : here to learn . That ' : her job . I understand , but , sir ... Your name has come up as a candidate for the ethics committee . It means a lot more money , and you 'll have a chance to shape hospital policy . You 'll want to be a part of that . In a living subject , this would be coursing with dark and blue venous blood . First , we take the liver , and you n no the inferior van : Professor ? And if you nick it in surgery ... Don 't . What 's the matter ? Well , I had a pretty bad run-In with Dr. Nelson . Ho ls investigating my conduct with the university . I think he wants to kick me out because I 've been digging around . Look , look , he ' : just an ass . And every year , he pick : one student to pick on . Nothing ever comes of it . No , I 'm not talking about hospital politics here . People are being put into comas . They 're putting people into comas ? Do you know what your grandfather would be saying to you right now ? Ho would be saying that no doctor wants to lose patient , and every doctor loses one . You have to promise yourself that you loam from It . I don 't understand . What are you saying ? I 'm saying for you to remember that you 're e doctor . You have a curious medical mind . Use it . Use it to alleviate the suffering of thousands of people to come . - Okay ? That ' : what ... - Excuse mo , Professor Hillside . Yes . Yes , yes . And if Dr. Nelson keeps on you , let me know about it . Hey , this is Jen . You know what to do . Leave a message at the tone . Hey , Jen , it 's me . I just got off the train , so I 'll be home in a minute . What do you want to do ? Stop ! Don 't ! Get off of me . Get off of me ! Help ! You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . Look , I really don 't no the point of this . Hold you , I didn 't no him . Maybe you sew him earlier In the evening , then he followed you . It might jar your memory . Look , truth is , Ms. Wheeler , there 's not much else we can do . The park is full of security cameras . We checked the footage . He must 've gotten you in a blind spot . You do believe me ? Short of a witness coming forward , we don 't have anything to go on . Great . This is my second case . I assisted Taylor about a year ago . This girl , Regina Harper , she was a college track star , and it was a simple cyst removal , and she never regained consciousness . Neither of them make any sense to me . That 's one of the reasons we invented God . To pin the blame for senseless occurrences on the whim of s higher power . I think Nelson dangled that job In front of mo to shut Susan up , which makes mo wonder If there really ls a problem at Memorial . - The position wan ' ! Nelson ' : Idea . - It was your Idea ? He 's just like everyone else , open to the right suggestions . What 's going on ? L got to go - Susan . Susan , you all right ? Yeah . I 'm sorry to bother you . I really am . No . Please . My roommate didn 't pick up her phone , and I tried my friend Anna . I tried Geoffrey Fair weather . 'Well , hey , look , I 'm honored to be your lat resort , okay ? Come on . Let 's get you out of here . Thanks . Did he hurt you ? It must have been rally terrifying I 'm so sorry . Did you get a look at him ? It was just a blur . I mean , he mo up behind mo and covered my head , throw mo down on the ground , and he just ran off . I don 't even think they believed me in there . Then we should talk to somebody higher up . I mean , you were attacked . They 've got to do something , right ? This might sound crazy , but I think this guy was In my apartment . What did the police say ? I didn 't tell them that . They were already blowing me off . But Jen said she thought the super was in our apartment to fix this light , but that light is still broken . " You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . " What does that mean ? That 's what he said in my ear when he was choking me . How come you didn 't tell me Nancy Greenly 's surgeon killed himself ? I know that it 's awful , but try not to make connections that aren 't there . But what if it 's not a pathogen or some piece of equipment ? I mean , what if it 's intentional ? No , that doesn 't make any sense . Why would you intentionally put a patient into a coma ? Organs ? Organs ? Bioengineering ? Okay , lot ' : say you wanted a heart or a lung , or oven a limb . Why not kill the patient during surgery ? Why even bother with a coma ? Death happens , and hospitals and families and judges accept that . But a coma , fairly or not , reeks of medical incompetence , and the lawyers come in . So , I mean , can you honestly tell me you think you 'd make more money harvesting organs than you 'd pay out in litigation ? I mean , you 'd have to be doing something that brought in billions of dollars . See that house ? When I was a third-year med student , my father had a heart attack and died . Add to that the hours and the siren , and I screwed up . I missed a fever in a patient , and by morning , she was full-blown septicemia . Dr. Taylor saved her and took me here . To his home , to have dinner with his family . Anyway , the reason I haven 't said anything , it 's not some conspiracy . I just ... It still hurts . I 'm sorry . No , no . Don 't be sorry . I honestly feel kind of silly , but ... Are you kidding ? I 'm not leaving until I know you 're okay . Is this your bedroom ? Where do you sleep ? Who sleeps ? My roommate 's gone . - Is this her room ? - Yeah . Boy , I 'd say , when she loaves , she really leaves . Oh , my God . Hi , Mom . What ? No , I 'm fine . What do you mean ? No , no , I 'm home . I 'm not in the hospital . Well , what did they say when they called ? No , no . No , no . Don 't come . I 'm fine . Really , I 'm home . This is a mistake . Okay . I love you , too . What happened ? Someone just called my mother and told her I was badly injured in a car accident . Who called ? They said they were from the ER at Memorial . Hey . I 'll see you later ? Yeah . Hey . What are you doing ? You can 't put a coffee cup on another human being . It 's disgusting . Hey , come on . Vanya , it 's not worth it , dude . You owe me a cup of coffee , bitch . " Did you screw her ? " What , are we in high school ? I have a patient , Mark . I think we should talk about this . Let 's keep our professional and our personal lives separate . No , but there was a Kathleen Wheeler admitted ... Susan Wheeler . I 'm a medical student . It 's a big hospital . Somebody called my mom In New York from the ER lat night . Let me ask my colleague . Let me see . Hey , let me see . Jesse ? Jesse ! Jesse , Jesse ! Jesse ! Help ! He 's choking ! Help , please , I need a stretcher . Get that stretcher . He ' : choking . We need to get him lntubetad . On three . One , two , three . Buzz open the door , please . No , no , It ' : asthma . Look , we no him twice a month . This is not asthma . The mother won 't get rid of the cats , the uncle smokes . - Who are you ? - I 'm a medical student . - This ls not asthma . - Okay . Well , excuse mo . Lot mo ... My brother has asthma . It ' : a different sound . Trust mo . Just hold on . All right , let me take a listen . Come here . All right , let 's get a tube in him . Excuse me , ma 'am . Lot ' : got her out of here . Marla , got the mother out of here . Ma 'am , please . Ho ' : going to be fine . You 'll be more comfortable out hero . Just calm down . What can I do ? Tilt his hood back . Hold him up like this . There you go . Vary good . All right . Here we go . There we go . There we go . All right . Hold him right there . Good . All right , this should be getting a good ... His O2 sat is dropping . I don 't think the tube is in place . Why don 't you just watch and learn ? On what ? - What do we have here ? - Dr. Stark , It ' : asthma . I 've lntubated ... It 's not asthma . He 's not responding to the epinephrine . That 's not asthma . He 's choking . His carina 's blocked . Okay , bronchos copy in the OR , right now . Jesse ! Okay ? There it is . And to the carina . And there 's where you were blocked . The air couldn 't get through the right main stem bronchus and into the lungs because there is a battery in the way . - A battery ? - A battery . Is Susan in there with Stark ? The man , the legend . Well , she is good . I got to give her that . I hear she showed up Feldson in the ER . Hey , why don 't you get a life ? Yeah , I get it . Get me into a fight , get me voted off the island . You see right through me , Carpin . I 'm going to need some extra hands here . - You ever done this before ? - No , sir . It 's easy . Right here . Here we go . Gentle , gentle . In we go . All right . You will grasp . One , two , three . Beautiful . Up we come . With me . Gently . With me . Good . Well done , Doctor . Jen , hey . Hey . What 's going on ? I 've been trying to call you . Yeah , my phone died . Sorry . Sorry to jun leave a note . My brother drove his truck up from Newnan . Last night was the only time he had . Here 's your key back . What 's going on ? They tossed me . What ? You know , it 's for the best . My grandma 's sick . This will give mo more time to spend with her . They said I could probably come back next year . I 'm just hero to sign some paperwork , dot the ' l 's , ' you know . I 'm sorry I skipped out on you . My head 's still spinning . What did they say ? They said my performance ween ' ! up to per . Up to per ? There were no tests , no evaluations . Did they find out about the files that you printed out for me ? No . Why ? If they did , they didn 't say anything . I 'm so sorry . Excuse me . Hi . Come on in . Let 's get a coffee . Are you okay ? I just found Jen , and I think I may have gotten her thrown out of school . I found out something yesterday . - Regina Harper , the coma patient . - Yeah . Her family received a check for $ 485,000 . Do you think this is connected ? - Hallo , doctors. nice work . - Dr. Stark . You got a star there , Dr. Bellows . Yes , this is Susan Wheeler . This is her first rotation . Pleasure to meet you under such circumstances . Sir , the honor is mine . You know , I took my fisrt anatomy clan from your grandfather . He was quite the taskmaster . He didn 't let much get by him , either . I was genuinely sorry to hear that he passed . Yeah , well , I was only 11 . You 're gonna do your family proud , but If you don 't , you 'll have me to answer to . Sir . It 's not you that I 'm worried about , it 's Stark . I 'll talk to him It 's just that he makes arbitrary decisions based on his God complex , and we have to live with him . I mean , I don 't know if you realize this , but he 's looking to scrap your study . Ho think : his heart program ls a big profit center . He 's already recruited Stafford . Maybe it 's time to replace him . Yeah , well , good luck with that . I mean ... He 's the rainmaker . A : long as he keeps bringing In funding , ho ' : not going anywhere . I want you to ﬂirt taking this medication three times a day until we see each other again . That 's once every eight hours . Do you understand ? And lat ' : stay away from Ila . Wheeler for while , okay ? Listen , I just came by to tell you that I spoke to Regina Harper 's brother . The coma patient , deceased , the one that I was ... Anyway , I went back into her file . There ' : no diabetes , there ' : no problems with previous : surgeries , and there ' : no sign of incompetence on Memorial ' : pert , yet she received some huge check from this brokerage firm . Now , the memo that I saw said Helix Global Care , Inc . What 's that ? I have no idea . I was hoping you could ... I mean , do they deal with the hospital ? Who knows ? Maybe it 's insurance . That would make sense , pay fast , cut your losses . But why are you talking about this with me ? The mother has Alzheimer 's , Margaret Harper . I didn 't know if you 'd seen her as a part of your study . I don 't have any patients named Harper , and you didn 't come here to talk about that . What did I come to talk about ? You came to dump me . We have something good , Mark . We could be a powerful couple at Memorial . I just think you need to think about it before you do something you 'll wish you hadn 't . I 've already done something I wish I hadn 't . Nice to see you 're capable of some emotion . Mark , don 't go . Yeah , I guess I just ruined my chances of getting on the ethics board , huh ? If there was a method that would bring an end to heart disease , lung disease or , say , Alzheimer 's , should we pursue it ? Of course . What if it involved testing on human subjects ? Assuming we 're working within the law , I 'd say we 'd have to weigh the risks against the benefits . What if the tests were only done on deceased patients ? What is this about ? These are the types of questions the ethics board will be asking candidates . You have my back , I 'll have yours . It 's your career , Mark . Don 't let her derail you . Dr. Bellows . Dr. Nelson . Just about to look in on Lefferts . - Wheeler ls done here . - Sir ? She accessed confidential patient files . I don 't care who her grandfather was . The friend is suspended , and Wheeler has to go , too . Now , I 've already told administration , and I expect your support . Sir , I ... You 're making me wonder , Bellows . Don 't . - Mark . - Julia , hi . I 'm so sorry I haven ' ! come by . I meant to , many times . I just haven 't . I was married to a doctor for over 40 years . You don 't have to tell me . Come on in . - It ' : great to no you . - Hay , Mark ! - HI . - Liza , hi . - How are you ? Good to no you . - Good . You , too . Hey , Donna , sweetie , time for a nap . Hi , Donna . - Can you shy for lunch ? - I wish I could . - I got to got back to the hospital . - Okay . - Thank you , though . Sloop tight , though . .Bye Good to see you . They love him so much . It ' : hard to imagine ho ' : not around anymore . I know . I sew him that morning , and I didn 't know he we : depressed . I would 've done something . I would 've said something . You know , just remember all of the lives that he saved , all the lives he brought Into the world . That ' : what I 'm doling . Did he give you any indication as to what he was struggling with ? - No . - Did he leave a note or ... I only wish he had . Just doesn 't seem like him , you know , not leaving his house in order . He came home from work and went straight to his den . I know this is awkward , but would you mind terribly if I look through his papers , his files ? You want to look through his papers ? Well , he didn 't bring his work home . Laptop ? His laptop , ha always left the laptop at his office . And I 'm sure that everything ' : been cleared out by now . I 'm sure . He 's in God 's hands now . Susan Wheeler ? I 'm sorry . Can I help you ? Can you come with us , please ? Dr. Bellows . - Hay , good morning , guys . - Good morning . I 'm a little embarrassed . Do you mind if we look inside your car ? - What do you mean ? Why ? - Well , we got a call . Now , it 's within your rights to refuse , but if you do , I have to tell them . I see . Is this a new policy for the entire staff or just me ? That 's what they pay me to do , sir . Yeah . Okay , sure , knock yourself out . Joe . Make sure you look carefully . Especially under the seats . That 's empty . You 're my witness . As assistant chief of staff , I 've called for n investigation Into your conduct . Mr. Powers and Ms. Chen serve as counsel for the hospital . And Mr. Oran represents the corporation that own : Memorial . Susan , you might not be familiar with my role at the hospital . I don 't meet many students . I 'm in charge of the day-to-day operations . That means I 'm responsible for the privacy and well-being of the patients and for the conduct of everyone employed at Memorial . I 'm a medical student . I 'm not employed by Memorial . If your actions result In the Injury or death of a patient , Memorial will be named in the resulting lawsuit . Although you do not receive compensation , legally speaking , you are an employee . Now , the first thing I need you to do , Susan , is to take a look at this list . Now , these are verifiable instances where you attempted to circumvent the privacy policies of Memorial and used another employee 's ID to access computerized records of patients , as well as those accessed by another student , Jennifer Randle , your roommate , I believe . Each of these patients was in a coma when they were discharged . - Right . - I was jun trying to figure out why . I need you to sign this . Is security hereto keep people out or to keep us In ? Dr. Stark . Thank you , gentlemen . Thank you . This is a disciplinary hearing , Dr. Stark . Memorial has a problem . Wheeler here has identified it . She should be given a pat on the back . Well , then , I 'll tell you what . You can give the deposition when something this girl does gets the hospital sued . This really doesn 't concern you , Doctor . I 'm chief of staff , Phil . Everything concerns me . There are people we all answer to , even the chief of staff . I wouldn 't want this to come back and bite you . Don 't let Phil get to you . He 's got a wife , three kids and a mother he loves . He 's not really a jackass . It 's just part of his job description . I will bring this up with the board . Not just the Memorial staff . The entire board . I believe in Susan , and I will personally guarantee her future conduct . All right , vary wall . You seem to have made a powerful friend . Hold onto him . I have something to show you . This will be the Memorial Children ' : Health Complex . In a financial climate where other hospitals are going under left and right , we are expanding . You know why , Susan ? People who care , people like yourself , will be the foundation upon which this future will be built . So , let 's talk about these coma statistics . We became aware of this issue a year ago , and a panel was created to study it . What troubles me is that some of the panel , Dr. Nelson , for example , might be inclined just to cover their asses , and others may actually try to suppress the truth because It does expose certain Incompetence or careless ness on their pert . You are a fresh pair of eyes . You 're not Involved In the sordid politics of this plea , and so I would be really curious to see what you might come up with if you were to dig around a little bit . One caveat , one requirement , is that you bring anything you find directly to me and only me . Well , Mark ... Dr. Bellows has also been vary helpful ... Susan , only me . I know it sounds paranoid , but he 's close to Dr. Lindquist , she 's close to Dr. Nelson , you get the picture . Don 't trust anyone . Anyone ? Almost anyone . What ? I feel like there might be some answers at the Jefferson Institute , and I can 't even get in there . Now you can . Thank you . Looking to take over Dr. Taylor 's office ? Dr. Nelson . No , I 'm just looking for something . What ? Dr. Taylor 's laptop , actually . Probably at the house . - No , no . Julia said It was here . - ' Julia . ' And what do you want with it ? Nothing . She just asked that I find it . Well , I can assure you the office has been thoroughly cleaned out . Yeah , yeah , it sure looks that way . Okay , well , it was worth a shot . So you know , I tried to have Susan Wheeler dismissed from Memorial . I heard that . How did that work out for you ? Well , loyalty to the family legacy seems to have superseded common sense . Thanks . I think you struck a nerve . There ' : a lot more going on around here than we think . Why ? I just found pills in my car . Pills ? What pills ? Oxycontin . At least 200 of them . Somebody 's trying to set me up . I heard Stark came to your rescue . Yeah . He promised to get me access at Jefferson . Are you sure you can trust him ? That 's what he said about you . Excuse me . Are you with the tour ? Yeah , I have an appointment . Well , come around that way . I 'll take you there . Identification ? You like my babies ? Yeah , they 're beautiful . This one 's Chinese , and this one 's mulatto . But still , they 'll always be my babies . You 're not with the Helix Global Care group . No . Dr. Stark arranged a tour . Oh , yes . Now , just stay with the tour . No use of cell phones . And no photography , please . Yes , ma 'am . ... with the most modern technology . This will be a demonstration that only our professional visitors got to soc . Barry , bring 143 up to Visiting Suite Six . Families need to feel like their loved ones are in a friendly , soothing environment . Visits must be arranged in advance , and we try and schedule the same room to establish a sense of continuity . We n transfer patient : to any one of our 10 visiting suites . Our breakthrough technology allows families to see loved ones in a comforting setting , while eliminating bedding and associated costs for the Institute . Remember , our families are completely unaware of this technology , and it 's only one of the many improvements we 've made in the field of long-term care . And now for our control room . From this room , we n monitor any patient ' : vitals . It 's also where we control the transfer of patients to and from the visiting suites . And I remind you again , no pictures , please . Barry , will you return 143 from Visiting Suite Six to Area One ? Roger that Thank you . And now , if you 'll join me for some refreshments , and then we 'll have a short presentation . ... Jesus . Holy Mary , Mother of God , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death . Amen . Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee . Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb , Jesus . Amen . Gentlemen . A young medical student has wandered off the tour . She 's in Corridor B. Pressure on the floor in Area One . - All security report . - We 're on It . Come on , people , it 's one tiny little girl . End the tour . Just get them all out of here . This is where our tour ends . You are entering a sterile area . Stay where you are . Security is on its way . No ! Let me go ! Let me go ! Why are they hanging ? They are suspended by painlessly inserted rods . The suspension allows us to tilt and rotate the body to prevent blood pooling . I know it may be shocking at first , but our methods have been approved by the AMA , the CDC , and the World Health Organization . They are covered by an artificial skin that protects them from infection and injury . They 're more comfortable than they would be in a standard hospital setting . If there 's the least possibility of rousing , then the computers will notify us . You see , they 're not really alive . But they 're not dead , either . Someone has to take care of them . It 's empty now , ma 'am . Oh , thank you , dear . There you are . Will I be allowed to leave now ? What else would we do with you ? Hey . Hey . What are you doing here so late ? Another coma . At least we didn 't cause this one . What happened ? Guy tried to off himself In a running r locked In his garage . Guess it was taking too long , so he cut his wrist with a hacksaw . Sliced right through the tendon . Good chance he 'll lose the hand , but he 'll never know . By the time they found him , he was brain-dead from the exhaust . Why is the blood so bright ? Oh , If I had to guess , I 'd say It ' : from the carbon monoxide . Dr. Ramirez ? Hey . Can I ask you one more question about Nancy Greenly ? I don 't think so . Just which operating room was she in ? The file says OR 3 . Then that 's what it was . No , wait . Three ' : on the left . No , It was one of the rooms on the right . Could it have been OR 8 ? Maybe . I don 't know . It just wasn 't three . When my study is complete , I believe we will finally be in a position for live testing . Sounds like Nobel territory . I just want to kill dementia . I 'm looking for keen minds who can help me take this project to the next level once the data comes in . Unless , of course , you 've chosen s different specialty . I 'm all yours . All yours . You 've reached Susan Wheeler . Sorry I missed you . Luvs I mange , and I 'll call you back . Thanks . Susan , hey . It 's Mark . I just got in , and I am just wondering how the Jefferson tour went , so give me a call when you get a second . Liza . Hi . What are you doing ? Come inside . No , I can 't . Donna 's in the car . Are you okay ? What 's wrong ? I didn 't want to leave without seeing you . I 'm driving down to Sarasota to stay with friends . In the middle of the night ? Why ? My mother won 't talk about it , but they came to the house after he died . They took all of his papers , all of his financial records ... Who came to the house ? - I don 't know . - Did you ll the pollen ? My mother wouldn 't let me . Liza , what the hell is going on ? I don 't know what 's happening , but I know what happened to my dad . Stay out of it , Mark . He loved you . Okay . Excuse me , miss ? You 're bleeding . Can I help you with it ? No . I didn 't even feel it . Thanks . You okay , miss ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I just cut myself on my way down the stairs . I 'm leaving now . Yeah , I ... Let me call you back . We never see each other anymore . What 's the occasion ? It 's a courtesy call , actually . I didn 't want you to hear this from anybody else . I 'm taking a leave of absence from teaching , actually . But you love teaching . It 's what you are . Yeah . It 's what makes me immortal . Oh , dear . Well , than number : aren 't so good , are they ? But I suppose If anyone n but them , you n . I see the lab work was done at Macon . Should I be insulted ? No . Forester 's an old , old friend of mine , and it 's only an hour and a half away . But you will have the surgery here . Justin is the best oncologist . The best . Forester is doing the surgery . I know what ' : going on , Sam . I 'm feeling It , too . I mean , we started with her grandfather . With her grandfather . It 's been that long . Not that either of us needs to be reminded how old we 're getting . She is like him , isn 't she ? Oh , boy . I no him every time I look Into her ayes In clan . Anything you need . Anything - In less than six months , the 607CLW therapy has completely altered the gene array in three of the 12 pre-Alzheimer 's patients . Well , that 's encouraging . But Stark ' : work with the Friedrick-Kane bioengineered heart is getting even better data . You know , It ' : tough selling prevention over cure . Stark 's going to fight you on this . I need one more subject to begin the trial of the 608 . If I begin within the weak , we n publish the results simultaneously . I thought you already had a full complement oftest subjects . One subject , a female , proved unviable . She we : pregnant and we : moved to another study . - It ' : not going to happen . - It has to . - We are so close . - One more ? You know it would require the full committee 's approval to add another subject to your study , and Stark 's backing the heart . We 're talking about preventing thousands of cases of Alzheimer 's in screened subjects . This is the breakthrough that we 've been looking for . I heard you were all up here . It 's all right . Boy , someone searched my r , and now this . This must be some presentation . What are you doing ? Who put pills in my car ? - Pills ? - Yes , pills . I 'm sorry , Doctor . I have to ask you to leave . The ethics board , of which you are not a member , has serious ... I 'm sorry , but what kind of ethical bombshell demands a guard at the door ? He 's your candidate . This is neither the time nor the place . We have to protect our intellectual property . Afraid of another Dr. Taylor incident ? la that It ? Maybe we should put a guard at all the doctors ' houses . - Mark , you are out of line . - Dr. Bellows , I 'm sure your students need you . Where is Stark anyway ? Pull ! Hell of a shot . - Now I need to hit one . - It ' : simple , Bill . You just got to know where your target 's going to be before he gets there . It 's like medicine . Pull ! If you know where medicine 's going to be in five years , say , well , then the rewards would just be there for the taking , wouldn 't they ? We 're just a little skittish about when we 'll see a return . We haven 't seen much from the Alzheimer 's project . We 're putting Alzheimer 's on the back burner house I 'm advancing a new study , the bio-hybrid heart . The genetic ton markers on this thing are astonishing . It 's going to be s billion-dollar business right out of the ... Heart disease is where the money is . Yeah . Right out of the gate . Pull ! Okay . Oh , my God . Mark , it 's me . I really need to see you . Can you moot mo at the university library after your shift ? Ramona , I need the department heed : In en hour , - and conference in London . - It 's evening in London , sir . Just get them for me , please . Oh , and I need ... What ' : his name ? Chad Morgan at NIH . - Right away , Dr. Stark . - Thank you . I 'll wait . Mr. Morgan 's wife says he 's out . She 's not sure when he 'll be back . He won 't pick up at dinner , sir . Dr. Stark , do you want me to call him later ? - Dr. Stark , can you hear me ? - What the hell ? Should I leave word ? Ramona , call 911 ! Dr. Stark ? I need help ! I need help right now ! - Ramona ! - Have you been In In accident ? Dr. Stark , what 's wrong ? Hi , Detective Jackson , please . Okay , tell him it 's Susan Wheeler . Yeah . Well , I just found a camera hidden in a light in my kitchen . Yeah , there 's a camera hidden in my kitchen , and it means I 'm being watched , so can I speak to him or not ? Well , he 's a fighter , I 'll give him that . I 'm not about to tell you how to run things , but events like this just ll attention to bigger problems . Well , it couldn 't have happened at a more inopportune time . There were no witnesses , but everything points to an accident . - Well , our first concern ls with Dr. Stark . - Of course . My second question is about personal effects . Files , charts that might have been loft In his r . We did a complete search of the vehicle . Nothing . But assuming he pulls through , he might want his phone back . - I 'll take re of It . - We got e ll from Susan Wheeler . Oh , yeah , the attacker with the burlap bag . She says she found hidden mom In her apartment , but she hung up before we could got anything else . So what do you want to do ? After what she said happened in the park , we 're going to go take a look . Okay . Hey , have you guys seen Susan ? She 's probably busy brown-nosing Bellows . She 's a Wheeler , remember ? He should be sucking up to her . Hey , Paul , why 'd you choose medicine ? I didn 't . Medicine chose me . Oh , well , how fortunate for you and medicine . I think so , too . No , my mom 's a psychiatrist . Step-dad owns the largest surgical supply business in the Southeast , and my dad delivered pretty much half the babies in Polk County . It 's in the blood , Fair weather . I guess it 's in my blood , too . My mother 's a hypochondriac , and my father makes me sick . What about you , Hanna ? Liked playing doctor so much , you figured you 'd get paid for it ? Wow , that 's really funny , Geoffrey , In a verging-on-sexual-harassment sort of way . No , I actually want to help people . And I want a big house . So why don 't you give Susan a break ? I mean , she wants to heal the sick . You can 't blame her for her pedigree . I doubt she wants a big house in Buck-head , but otherwise , she 's just like the rest of us . Jeez . Dude , we 're eating here . All right , listen up . They chose us for a reason , we 're the best students here . Now , och yer , they choose one student to fast-track for residency . Now , do we sit back and let it be her , or should it be one of us ? What are you proposing ? Did you hear a proposal ? Look , if she makes a mistake , let 's not keep it a secret . - Yeah , like the hypodermic angst . - Yeah . Or , I have a novel idea . What don 't y 'all work harder and get noticed that way ? Did you hear about Stark ? No . What happened ? He had a car accident . He went off an overpass . Is he okay ? I 've heard three different things about his condition . I don 't know what to believe . He 's at Mercy now . They 're going to transfer him here this afternoon . Well , was It an accident , or was he trying to kill himself , too ? Mark , you have got to let this thing about Taylor drop . And what were you saying bout pills ? What pills ? Somebody planted pills in my car . Okay , I don 't know what 's going on with you , but if you really cared about Taylor and his work and what he left behind , you 'll stop causing trouble . " Causing trouble " ? What does that even mean ? It means that I 'm trying to preserve his legacy . Well , maybe Memorial 's not the place for me after all . Susan is what 's keeping you from realizing your full potential . Okay . Do you really think things are diffrent at any other hospital ? HI. just need to make sure my name ' : off the locker list . It ' : 825 . - Thanks . - Sure . Excuse me . Dr. Taylor , he 's not 829 . He 's just two down from me . He probably changed it without telling us . Susan , I got here as soon as I could . Susan , I got here as soon as I could . - I found mom In my apartment . - They 're watching you ? I called the pollen , but we 'll no If they do anything . Look , there 's a company called Helix Global Care , Inc . Now , they own Jefferson . They 're making payments to the doctors and the families of all these coma patients . There 's some sort of brokerage account . Look at all these transactions . He ) ! In all 10 coma es , the procedures were done In OR I. Of course , they changed all the records so that no one would notice the pattern . I followed a gas line from OR 8 down to the basement . It wasn 't attached to any tank . All the blood in the patients was bright red . Carbon monoxide ? After they 've chosen a patient , they must move in the tank . Then they control it remotely , and not even the doctor or the surgeon or the anesthesiologist would have any idea . You 're saying that they 're choosing the patients ? They pick them from genetic markers based on pre-surgery blood tests , and I 'm just trying to figure out why . Okay , well , think about it . The human body is the ultimate laboratory , right ? Its functions are interrelated and impossible to duplicate . I think they 're performing tests on people who are predisposed to certain diseases . - Yeah . - We got to go to the pollen . Wait . If we sound an alarm too soon , they can just destroy everything . I mean , I think we should gather all the evidence we can . Ia there any paperwork , any hard copies that the hospital keeps ? Anything with , like , a signature ? Yes . Yes , the blood work . Most of it goes to outside labs . Great . - Hare ' : a list of the 0 numbers . - Okay . - Can you go to Hematology ? - I 'll go right now . - I 'm going to go to the biology lab . - Okay . Let 's meet back at my place , yeah ? Okay . What 's at the biology lab ? I recognize some of the sequences from the genetic research they do there . What do you mean , you recognize the sequences ? This is research my grandfather started . - I 'll no you soon . - Okay . - Thanks . - How ' : the log ? Oh , it 's better . Thanks . Got you working on Saturdays , too ? Well , the place is all yours . - Thanks . - Thank you . Sir , can I help you ? Oh , I 'm meeting the young lady who just went up to the fifth floor . She 's expecting me . Well , that 's a Memorial ID , and it doesn 't work here . I 'll only be a second . Let 's start by you stepping out and showing me your ID . Mark , what are you doing here ? I got some ... It 's a long story . You can 't be here . Are you in trouble ? Did you really push yourself into a meeting upstairs ? Trying to get yourself fired ? I ... It seems I am . Maybe you 're not worried about your job , but I 'm keeping mine . Fiona , come on . Please , do we have to do this now ? Why don 't you ask Agnetta ? Maybe she can help you out . I 'm begging you . Please ? Please ? These ere archived lab orders , Mark , It ' : not life or death . Actually , it is . - Five minutes . - You 're the bani . Thank you . Susan . Are you in there , Susan ? Susan . Susan . Ms. Wheeler ? It 's Detective Jackson . You called earlier . Hello ? Hello ! All clear in here . I SPY Sir ? Sir ? You okay ? Help ! Help ! Help Susan . Don 't be afraid . Susan . Here I come , ready or not . Susan . Susan ? Hello ? Mark ! Hey , I was looking for you . We need you In surgery now . It ' : en emergency . I 'm sorry . I can 't do it . - You cant ' ? Can ' ! what ? - Got Cortez ! You 've reached Susan Wheeler . Sorry I missed ... Susan ! Who are you ? Who are you ? All right , Susan told me to meet her here . I heard e terrible noise on the other end of the phone ... - A noise , huh ? - We there struggle here ? How should I know ? Looks like there might have been struggle here . - Is that her blood ? - Why do you think It ' : blood ? That 's blood . I 'm Dr. Mark Bellows . What ls the nature of your relationship with Me . Wheeler ? She is e student and e colleague of mine over at Memorial Hospital . - Are you doling her ? - ' Well , that ' : none of your business . Listen , I don 't think we have time for this , okay ? Susan has stumbled on some kind of situation ... - What kind of situation ? - I don 't know , but I think she ' : In danger , and I need to find her , so , please , I 'll explain everything , but we have to find her . She 's at the ... I think you should come with us . Hold it , Doc ! Freeze ! Freeze ! I 'm sorry . Look , I wasn 't running , okay ? I have no reason to run . And I 'm not chasing you . Any place but Memorial . Please don 't take me to Memorial . Susan . Susan . I 'm very patient . I like waiting . Some people don 't mind waiting , but I like it . Ginnie Newberger had long hair , longer than yours . And curls down her back that ended just at her bra strap . Susan . I know you 're here . I can smell you . Ginnie wore a white blouse , with different colored skirts ! Can you hear me , class ? Ginnie ... Four hundred dreams . She kept them in a journal . Nighttime dreams , with dates and times . She carried it around with her , so her parents wouldn 't find it . And she wouldn 't even let anyone look at it . I wanted it . 'Cause I wanted to see if any of her 400 dreams were the same as mine . So I waited . I watched her back . I watched her bra . 'Cause I knew it was just a matter of time . One day , I put a bag on her head and I smashed it with a stone they used to mark the edge of the trail . I had the rest of the day to alt them and mad the journal before they found me . And you know what ? Her dreams weren 't all that different than mine . They were even a little bit dull . All these years later , I remember more about her crisp , white blouses than a single one of her dreams . You know what 's disgusting ? Someone donates their body to medical school , and think : they 're helping cure cancer , and end : up like this . It 's disrespect . It 's disrespect . It 's disrespect ! I know you 're here , Susan . I can feel you . Dr. Bellows . Where ' : Susan Wheeler ? Is she okay ? - She 's gathering evidence . - What evidence ? The coma : at the ... We were supposed to moot at her place . Tell her I 'm okay , please . Make sure she gets this . I will . Captain ! Commissioner got a call from the Wheeler family . They haven 't been able to get in touch with her . Asked me to follow up . Susan ! Susan ! I 'm not comfortable with it . I thought we agreed adding another subject was unwise . - The genetics markers ﬂt the protocol . - I don 't like It . I don 't like It , other , but It solves a lot of our other problems . Please , no . Please . Please . It 's a dream . It 's a dream . It 's a dream . Please , don 't put me under . The surgery 's over , Dr. Bellows . You did fine . They had to put three screws in your ankle , but the bone in your leg should heal up nicely . You 'll be in a boot for about a month or so . - Where am I ? - Marcy . You 're In Mercy . Mercy ? Mercy . Hello ? You 've reached Dr. Mark Bellows . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave a message after the beep . Mark , it 's me . Where are you ? Look , I lost my cell phone , and I 'm home now . But I don 't know that I should stay here . Look , I 'm going to go ... I 'm going to go to the place where you saved me . I know you know where I mean . Just be careful , okay ? Susan , right ? Thank God . We 've been looking for you . It 's okay . I saw Mark a little while ago . Mark ? - Where Is he ? - He was In an accident , broke his log . - What ? - They 're taking good re of him . He was very worried about you . He gave this to me for you . He said you 'd know what to do with it . Do you know what it is ? Yeah . This is proof that Memorial is targeting patients for comas . Really ? Marie made the cheerleading squad . She wore your school ring on a chain around her neck . It made her feel like ... So this job is great , but it 's in Stanford , and I 'm gonna be moving . Visiting hours have ended for this evening . We look forward to seeing you again soon . - No ! - Lot ' : go . Let 's go , let 's go . There we go . Hello , Susan . Who found him ? His replacement found him . Surveillance footage was wiped clean . Bellows tried to tell us where she was going . We 've got another one . Up here . Detective , got something else . Find somebody to turn that damn thing off . Something tells me that belongs to Susan Wheeler . Detective . Anything on here about comas ? No . It looks like genetic code maybe . We 've got something else . All right , hold on to that . True you had a runner hit by a car while you were talking to him ? Yeah . Apparently , I needed the exercise . Through there . This place gives me the creeps . Oh , boy . Is this going to take much longer ? I have a memorial to attend . Arno 's first arrest was as a minor in Portland . You know I can 't talk about that . Patient confidentiality . Yeah . Well , the file says that he kidnapped a young woman In the woods , put a burlap bag over her head , and bashed her brains in . I 'd say that qualifies him as violent . Yet you made a recommendation for release . And then after he was released , you helped him secure a job as an electrician at Memorial . He was the perfect patient . He responded very well to an anti psychotic drug trial . The treatment was augmented by intensive daily psychotherapy . When you continued to see him as a patient , did you ever have any concerns about his mental state ? I have concerns about all my patients . Any special concerns ? No . You know Susan Wheeler ? She 's a medical student at Memorial . You really expect me to believe you don 't know who she is ? Students come , students go . Oh , jeez . What 's going on in here ? I just need you to help me got this catheter out . Sir , you can 't be pulling this stuff off . Sir , you are heavily medicated . Listen , I need you to gal my phone and n Ir st . There 's no one here that can discharge you . Okay , I 'm a doctor . I 'm going AMA . I can discharge myself , thank you . Dr. Bellows . A little soon for you to be up and around , isn 't it ? Hi . Did you guys find Susan yet ? Not yet . What do you mean , " Not yet " ? I told the other cop where to find her . You did ? Yes , at her apartment . She was gathering evidence . I gave him the blood panels . I 'll send a car to Wheeler 's apartment . No , no , don 't do that . She left me message . We should go to the university pool . Do you know a Dr. Agnetta Lindquist ? I do . She 's head of psychiatry at Memorial . How about a fellow named Peter Arno ? No . Why ? He was her patient . He just cut his throat in the Lindbergh anatomy lab . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . Don 't do that . That 's what 's going to keep you nice and comfortable . The hospital 's putting healthy people into comas because they fit a study . You see , this is why I think that the back of the hand is a bad idea . I actually prefer the scalp , like the neonatal do it . You 're testing them . Do they ... Do they know ? Do the families know ? When I got back from my honeymoon , my sister 's little girl , Theresa , got very sick . They took her to the hospital and found out she had spinal meningitis . Pediatrician said we were going to lose her before morning . I made a promise to God that If he would spare my litle girl ' : life ... My niece 's , Theresa , that I would never ask for anything for myself again , not ever . That night , Theresa 's fever broke . And when e year , two years , three years passed and It turned out that I couldn 't conceive , bear a child of my own , I never complained . Never once . Because that was the promise I 'd made with God . Now I have all the babies I want , right here . Hey Any luck ? Nothing in either locker room . She wasn 't on the surveillance footage . We 'll leave some men here in case she shows up . Any other idea where she might be ? - No . - I 'm still waiting to her from the captain . We 're going to go check out Peter Arno ' : place . How is that going to help us find Susan ? He was following her . We might find something . I 'm coming with you . You know , I 'm not a doctor , but you might want to shy off that foot . Oh , you think ? - Thanks . - Yeah . How long ago did he move in ? Six months or so . Any trouble ? Same as all the rest . I got three apartments I rent out . It 's $ 80 a week , share the bathroom . No pets , nothing kinky . Oh , that 's good to know . He ever say anything about this woman ? He never said anything about anything . " You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . " That 's what he said to her . No . What are you doing ? Those numbers are too high . You 're going to kill me . No , " 0 . We 'll take good care of you . Just relax . Soon you 'll be floating . Floating away . You won 't be dead . Course , you won 't be alive . That 's right . Yeah . No . I think I 'll use the eights . Those tens might shatter her pelvis . She 's quite petite . Susan ! - Maguire . - You , ma 'am ? Find Ms. Wheeler . She 's up and about . Although she 's definitely under the influence . And tell Talbot to check the security footage . I want to know who entered the prep room . - May I help you ? - Atlanta PD , ma 'am . Have you seen this woman ? Oh , Susan Wheeler . She did e tour here with us recently . Why , is she in any trouble ? So she wasn 't here today ? - No . - Mind If we come In ? - Yes . - Yes , we n , or yes , you mind ? Well , there 's no admittance to the facility after 7 : 00 p.m. I 'm sorry , but I 'm under a strict mandate by our legal department . Susan ... - Help us . - Please . Get me out of here . Susan , help me . Susan . Help me , Susan . Hey , you , get out of there ! You 're not authorized to be down there ! We 'd just like to talk to your staff . I am the staff . You 're not the whole staff . Code Yellow , Area One . Code Yellow , Area One . What 's Area One ? Oh , it 's one of our holding areas . My babies . My babies . Hey . Ma 'am , ma 'am , please . Young men , we house severely Ill patients here . We have to keep any possible contamination to e minimum . I 'm sure you can understand that . I do , I understand . But I 'm a doctor . Well , you 're not a doctor here . I 'm a doctor everywhere . I do not have the authority to admit you . I 'm sorry . I will be glad to answer your questions , but unless you return ... - Ma 'am ? - ... with e court order , I cannot let you enter . Please , ma 'am , you don 't ... You don 't understand . Please ! - Yeah . - This ls en emergency . Please ! Oh , good . Okay . We got to get in there . What if Susan 's inside ? We found the captain . He 's at Stark 's . No ! No ! Please ! We were looking all over for you . You can 't be part of it . Part of it ? This is my invention . Mine and your grandfather 's . The Idea for this was born In conversation that we started 30 years ago . I 'm not naive enough to think that you 'll be able to understand what I 'm about to say is a compliment , but this is all yours . This is your legacy . No . This will never be my legacy . You know that 200 years ago , surgeons had to sneak into graveyards and steal bodies for dissection . These specimens ere en enormous advance of knowledge . We have bioengineering . We have stem cells from umbilical cords . Nobody understands the costs until they see benefits . Benefits ? This is human sacrifice . That 's exactly the right word . " Sacrifice . " What are you doing here ? When these specimens cease to be viable , they 're harvested for their tissue and their vital organs and their corneas and their skin , and they continue to be of utility to mankind . Do you think that makes this right ? I will not apologize to you for what I 've been doing . You don 't have the life experience to come to the conclusions that I have come to , to come to the conclusions that your grandfather came to . When you have spent your life arguing with bureaucrats and begging on your knees for the last $ 5 of the grant , then you can tell me that we should go back and just fix broken bones , and then tap the fatally ill on the head . Or you can say , " We can continue . " I 'm Detective Jackson , Atlanta PD . Excuse me . Susan Wheeler . Do you know where she is ? Have you seen her ? Dr. Bellows . Please , I mean , have you not heard Dr. Stark passed away during surgery this afternoon ? - What ? - We 're hero to honor his memory . What 's the meaning of this , Jackson ? Look , I 'm sorry , sir . Susan Wheeler was attacked at the university today , and now she 's gone missing . She 's not here . Wait a second . You told me that you were going to look for her . After I saw you , I wont to Ms. Wheeler ' : apartment to look for her , and she didn 't show . I came here directly after I heard that Dr. Stark had passed away during surgery . Now , I have two men watching her place right now . You 've wasted enough time here , Jackson , and you 're testing the patience of Dr. Stark ' : colleagues , who have come hereto honor his memory . Yes , sir . " Yes , sir " ? That 's it ? Hey , wait a second . We 're still looking . Hopefully , she 's found a safe place where she can stay out of sight . - Detective ! - I know when she is . She 's at Jefferson . You murdered Seen Berman , Nancy Greenly . They were people I knew , with lives and people who loved them . I confess that I keep such knowledge at bay so that I can keep a steady hand , but the herd must be culled and we must perfect mankind . Did you know that in this building right now , there is a cure for Alzheimer 's and lupus ? Does that make any difference ? And we will cure cancer and the common cold and everything else . And It ' : taken us thousands of years to got here . It would have taken thousands more if your grandfather and I had not come to this decision . Does that mean anything to you ? You are sick . No ! No ! - Stop her ! - Susan ! All right , now , everybody , just split up . Make sure we cover all the floors . Cuff him . Where is she ? You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . Where 's Susan ? You have the right to have en attorney present during questioning . Oh , God . If you cannot afford one , one will be provided to you at government expense . Do you understand these rights as I have read them to you ? Help me ! No ! Susan ! Susan ! 'Help . No ! No ! - No - Susan Susan ? Susan . Mark . Mark . Hi . You 're here . I had a terrible dream . I dreamt I was underwater . I didn 't think I could ever get out . Well , you 're okay now . You 're safe . It was just a dream . It was just a dream .

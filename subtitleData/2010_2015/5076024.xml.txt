 ARTIE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... You got what you wanted . Now get out . No , this is just step one . This is an artifact nuclear device . ( BEEPING ) ( CRACKLING ) MYKA : Helena , what are you doing ? You 've protected us from the blast . ( BOMB BEEPING FASTER ) ( EXPLOSION ) LEENA : Mrs. Frederic ! PETE : That was his plan , to destroy the entire warehouse . We lost , Artie . Not yet . PETE : Artie ? Artie ! What did you mean ? About what ? What do you mean when you said " not yet " ? PETE : The watch . Is it ... Is it something ? Is it some kind of a warehouse rebuilder ? Oh , my God . Lavoisier 's law of the conservation of mass , matter cannot be created nor can it be destroyed ! It 's Lavoisier 's watch , isn 't it ? It can somehow reconstitute matter . Right ? Myka . Well , thank God ! I mean , what are you waiting for , Artie ? Wave the watch and rebuild the Warehouse ! Do you think you can bring back Steve and H.G. , too ? Listen to me . This watch is not a rebuilder . ( SIGHS ) It 's not a reconstituter . Okay , wait . You said " not yet , " Artie . Please , have something up your sleeve . Artie , if we ever needed some sort of Warehouse magic , now would be the time . Look , all I can tell you is that this is some kind of a key to what might be a fail-safe device . I ... I don 't know . Artie ? Can you feel that ? All I feel is really sad . Exactly . Oh , dear God , no ! Artie ! Artie , where are you going ? Artie ! Where are you going ? ( SIGHS ) MYKA : Artie , what is that ? ARTIE : Well , it was the Ytterbium Chamber . What 's so important about the ... The what is it ? The what now ? Nothing anymore . It was made of pure lutetium . It 's the hardest metal on earth . And I had hoped that it would survive and protect the ... Protect the what ? I just can 't be absolutely certain until I 've checked a television ! I gotta go to Leena 's . Oh , now I know he 's lost it . He never watches television . Okay , so the watch might lead us to an artifact , but we have no idea what or where that artifact is . Or if it has a downside . Nor do I know what that artifact might do . I don 't even know what the watch does ! All right , well , we should ask Mrs. Frederic . She 'll know what to ... ( ARTIE SIGHS ) I imagine Mrs. Frederic ... Is gone . Gone ? What ... What do you mean , she 's gone ? She collapsed and then just ... She just disappeared right in front of us . Mrs. Frederic is ... Is dead ? Wait , so when the Warehouse was destroyed , Mrs. Frederic was ... The Warehouse was what ? The bomb destroyed the whole place ? Listen to me ! Is there anything left ? Please , everyone ! If we 're gonna get through this , we have to take a deep breath and you have to focus . Now , Leena , Claudia . The bomb that Walter Sykes set off was far more powerful than we imagined . We only survived because H.G. Wells insulated us from the blast . And she was killed . Oh , my God . Artie . Pete , Myka . Mrs. Frederic , as caretaker of Warehouse 13 , was organically connected to the Warehouse . And when it was taken , she went with it . So ... PETE : Trailer . All right , look , um , take a deep breath and focus , right ? Okay , all right . Come on , Artie . Let 's go . Use the watch . Watch ? What watch ? MacPherson 's watch ? Artie , I thought you didn 't know how that worked . I don 't . We also don 't know if it has a downside . Well , yeah , but what difference does it make ? Well , it 's a danger that we have to consider . ( SCOFFS ) Who cares ? Mrs. Frederic is dead . Steve is dead . H.G. Is dead . I know . I watched her die . But every day people die . Sometimes it 's people we care about , and sometimes it 's even people that we love . We just ... We just need to make sure that we 're not being selfish . The Ytterbium . The Ytterbium Chamber . Artie , what about the Ytterbium Chamber ? It 's gone . The what ? What 's in there ? Pandora 's Box . MYKA : What ? What 's that even mean ? No one seems to be able to pinpoint exactly why there has been this sudden and steep decline across every financial market that is now open . The Dow has lost 58 % of its value in the last hour . Currencies across the globe are crashing in this stunning financial meltdown that experts say may be the delayed reaction to the turmoil that has gripped the world 's economies in recent months . As a result , rioting and looting has broken out in dozens of major cities . Lester Holt is with us about an even more bizarre development . Lester ? Ed , thanks . In dozens of major cities around the world , this morning 's panic is trending towards spates of both individual and group suicides . Here in New York , there have been at least 16 separate incidents reported . Witnesses say in most cases an overwhelming depression gripped the victims and ultimately led them to take their own lives . Uh , wait . You 're saying that all that was caused by the explosion here ? " And in the bottom of Pandora 's Box , all that remained was hope . " So , when the Warehouse was destroyed ... The world lost hope . ARTIE : " Barbosa . " Thoughts ? What else does it say ? I don 't know . I can 't see anything else . Maybe if I had a microscope , I could see . It 's a Portuguese language . Also a surname . So , it 's probably the name of the watchmaker . Artie , look at that . Where ? There . " Carregar o botao . " I don 't know what that is . That 's Portuguese for , uh , " push the button . " Really ? This is still a surprise to you ? Well . Here goes . ( SIGHS ) ( CLICKING ) ( ALL GRUNTING ) Well , nobody got vaporized . Artie , look . I see it . It 's turned into a stopwatch . Let me see . A 24-hour stopwatch . MYKA : Yeah . But it ... It didn 't start at 24 hours . It started , well , just over 23 hours . Why ? Because it started counting down the moment the Warehouse was destroyed . And this is all the time we have left . Left till what ? MYKA : Well , whatever this fail-safe is , maybe we have to use it within the next 23 hours . And maybe once we find the fail-safe , that 'll buy us back 24 hours . Okay . So , we have around 23 hours to find this ... Whatever the hell it is and it 's anywhere in the world ? I like beavers . I 'll take Canada . Artie , look . The back of the watch . It 's ... It 's loose . ( CHUCKLES ) It is loose . Nothing . There 's nothing . There 's no symbols , there 's no writing . There should be something . MYKA : Black diamonds . Where ? Right there . Look , usually watchmakers use rubies . I 've never seen anyone use black diamonds before . She 's right . It 's black diamonds . What does that mean ? Leena , bring the pump needle . Artie , what are you doing ? Artie , where are you going ? ARTIE : To the Warehouse ! You know it blew up , though , right ? ( BEEPING ) Shouldn 't we be trying to figure out what the fail-safe does ? Exactly what I 'm doing . There ! Pete ! ( GRUNTS ) Yeah , okay . All right , all right , all right , all right . ( LAUGHS ) I knew that wasn 't regulation weight . ( BEEPING ) Wait ! So the football isn 't an artifact ? Uh , it 's an artifact tracker . No , the football is constantly in the process of collecting information on various artifacts all over the world . It would normally download that information into the Warehouse system as it passes overhead . Now that we have a clue , black diamond , the football is our only resource . Yeah , well , I 've been through Google , Bing , AltaVista , Yahoo , Hotbot , Galaxy , Gigablast , Alexa , and Cuil , and I can 't find anything on black diamonds , unless you 're looking for jewelry , ski gear or tattoos . Internet is a distant second to the football . ( FOOTBALL BEEPING ) ( READING LATIN ) " By this sign we conquer . " It 's a Templar motto . I hate running into the Knights of the Templar . They 're always so tense and they 're overly devoted to whatever kooky task they 've been given . Yeah , that would be annoying . ( MACHINE BEEPS ) " Richerenches ? " That 's in the south of France . There was an underground sect in Richerenches . 16th century , I think . And it was descended of the Templar . It 's very dangerous . ( MACHINE BEEPING ) I got it . " The Brotherhood of the Knights of the Black Diamond . " The Internet knows everything . Okay , looks like we 're off to France to find a ... We still don 't know what , do we ? We 'll know it when we find it . Leena . You 've gotta talk to Mr. Keeler . MYKA : Uh , Keeler . That was the Regent from the grocery store , the one who let us into the Vault , right ? Yes , he 's also got a Masters in History from USD Rapid City and he 's got access to a private Regents ' library there . And you are gonna need him to do the research . Uh , what am I researching ? A plan , right ? I mean , if we 're gonna somehow get the day back , we 're gonna need a plan to stop the bomb . Precisely . Leena , you 're gonna have to research and locate an artifact that was in Warehouse 13 and if we can erase 24 hours , an artifact that we can use to defuse Sykes ' bomb . How hard could that be ? ( SIGHS ) ( GROANS ) Good game . Thank you . Precisely 22 hours and 18 minutes to get to Richerenches , find the artifact , figure out what it does , and go back far enough to stop the Warehouse from being destroyed . Great . What could possibly go wrong ? I 'm not going . What ? But , Claudia ... It 's too late already , isn 't it ? We 're never gonna get there in time . PETE : In time for what ? What ? We 've gotta try ! In time to go back far enough to save Steve . I 'm taking the Metronome . I 'm bringing him back . Claudia . Claudia ! Bring him back to what ? A world without hope ? Okay . Look , I get it . I do . We all do . We 've all lost someone we care about . And if you live long enough , it happens over and over again . Listen , Claud , we need everything that we got right now . We need you . ( SIGHS ) Okay . Don 't think this is over . I will remember what I have to do . And nothing will stop me from doing it . ARTIE : 10 hours , 28 minutes left . MYKA : Why are there signs for truffles everywhere ? ARTIE : Black Perigord truffles , to be precise . They 're also known as black diamonds . The public face of the Brotherhood is that they collect and auction the truffles for the church . Not a lot of other info exists on them . Well , they 're an intensely secretive sect . Oh . Why 's it so cold in the middle of summer ? It 's not actually cold . Are you kidding me ? It 's freezing . It 's a physical manifestation of the loss of hope . Our minds are starting to interpret weather and music , sounds , colors in a duller , darker context . Our brains are producing far fewer endorphins . That explains why Pete didn 't hit on that flight attendant . I know , right ? That 's not like me . We can control the loss of hope if we dig into other emotions , focusing on those . I 'm using anger . It 's working rather well . Artie , there 's the commandry . ARTIE : It 's been converted . Wait , Barbosa . Isn 't that the name of the watch company ? Yeah . Let 's get that cab . Uh , I 'm assuming the rest of you have noticed the two guys following us . Yeah . Since the station . They 're not doing a very good job of hiding it . It 's the Brotherhood 's turf . They don 't have to hide it . Well , they could have at least made it challenging . You know , professional courtesy ? Hi , guys ! Pete ! Okay , who 's got francs . CLAUDIA : Euros . Bonjour ! Okay . Allons-y . ( ENGINE STARTS ) Okay . Fill us in . The percussive force of the House of Commons masonry was fueled by the Nazi regime 's hate . That 's why it was so powerful . More than any war in history , Hitler 's campaign was driven by pure violent hate . We 're thinking an artifact of pure peace might counteract it . It sounds reasonable . Any ideas ? Uh , something that Sargent Shriver owned ? He was the first director of the Peace Corps . Yeah , or the first peace treaty ever signed ? We must have that . A peacekeeping missile ? And that 's why this is not my department . We 'll find something , Artie . All right . I assume your alien mother ship will be taking you back home ? Okay . Is that enough of a challenge for you ? Yes . Much better . Thank you . Artie , look at that door behind them . Carbonado is the mineral name for black diamonds . And prive means that 's probably where we need to go . All right , Myka and I 'll distract the Brotherhood . You guys go find the magic doohickey . It 's not a doohickey . It 's a fail-safe . Whatever . As long as it 's magic . Be careful because those guys will not think twice about killing you . Okay , so what 's the plan ? Plan ? No , that 's all I had . You usually have all the plans . What ? I 'm kidding , watch this . Oh , guys ! Hey ! How are you ? Hey , listen , I 'm thinking you guys can help me . I 'm looking for Ye Olde Truffle Shoppe . Anything ? It 's in my , uh , my Go France guide . I promised the missus I 'd get her some of those shrooms she loves . Ah , there she is . Come on out ! No , come on out , honey . Huh ? Huh ? Look at that figure . Well , she likes to put the , you know , the shrooms in her salad . She 's a bit of a health nut . Which apparently you can understand . Can 't you , big guy ? Woo ! Oh , man . You 're big . Oh , my God ! You 're ... Not gay , but open-minded , baby ! ( GROANS ) Really ? That was the plan ? Hit the big one ? ( MAN GROANS ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) All right . We 're here . Any idea what we 're looking for yet ? We 're looking for anything out of place . If they hid an artifact in here , they 'd need some kind of clue or a map to find it again . This is nuts . Is it bigger than a baguette ? Is it an antique corkscrew ? Napoleon 's original pastry ? I mean , it could be anything . I ... Wait a minute . Look at this . Claudia , you see the difference between that ... and that ? Yeah . These barrels have space between them and the wall . This is right up against it . Sneaky , sneaky . Yeah . So , there 's something about these barrels that ... Something about these barrels ... ( WOOD CREAKING ) ( LAUGHS ) ( WOOD CREAKING ) Ha ! ( LAUGHS ) Yes ! There is a track under here . Ow ! ( BONE CREAKING ) Ow ! Okay , all right . Nice . You found a track . ( STRAINED ) And I broke my back . I think it 's L4 . No , L5 . You know what ? Pull my elbows down , put your knee right under ... Yeah , that 's gonna happen . Help me pull these forward . All right . ( CLAUDIA GRUNTS ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Harder ! Harder . Come on ! Pull harder ! I am pulling . Did I mention I broke my back ? ( GRUNTS ) Just pull , grandma ! Ah . No . ( GRUNTS ) ( PANTS ) Maybe it 's something else . No . Never give up , never surrender ! Just give me a second . Let me look at this . CLAUDIA : Okay , six barrels , same labels , same trim pieces . Same ... Oh , it 's so obvious . ( PANTS ) Ah , that 's better . ( GRUNTS ) ( CLICKING ) Huh ? Huh ? Again . Okay . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( SQUEAKING ) ( STRAINED ) Ah , yeah . That 's it . ( BOTH PANTING ) You 're still an expert at breaking and entering . It 's like stealing a bicycle . All right . And how are you at breaking through walls ? Well , we 'll find out , won 't we ? Hope Pete and Myka are okay . ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( CLAUDIA GRUNTS ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey , Pooh Bear . Hmm ? You wanna let me do that ? Now do you see why it was important that you came along ? Yeah . I can just picture you trying to get through here . " Oh , help and bother , I 'm stuck ! " All right , all right . " I am so rumbly in my tumbly . " Stop it . " Silly old bear . " ( GRUNTS ) Enough . ( CLAUDIA COUGHS ) What do you see ? Claudia ? Claudia , can you hear me ? Claudia ? Are you all right ? I 'm fine ! I think I found something ! ( GRUNTS ) I found something , right ? Dear God . ( BLOWS ) This is an Astrolabe . Yeah , and if I 'm reading this right , it belonged to Ferdinand Magellan . ( SIGHS ) That must mean this " M " on the watch is for ... That 's why it 's a 24-hour stopwatch . Because Magellan was the first guy to sail all the way around the world . So , you actually paid attention in fifth grade ? Yes . Now think back to your youth , and try to remember what he said to you on deck the night he crossed the International Date Line . I never tire of those comments . If this is a fail-safe then it must have been imbued with something . Something that lets it erase 24 hours . But ... But , but , what ? The alidade , eyepiece that affixes to the center . It 's missing . It 's what the sailors used to look through to get their bearings . Okay . It must still be in here . It 's not very deep . ( GRUNTS ) Only about 12 feet back before it dead ends in solid rock . Uh , it 's just a straight piece of brass , pointed slightly on each end . Uh . Please . Who doesn 't know what an alidade looks like ? ( GRUNTS ) There 's nothing back here , Artie . Absolutely nothing ! Maybe it 's ... That belongs to us . You don 't understand . The world has lost hope . No , my friend . It 's you who doesn 't understand . I can 't let you take the Astrolabe . ( SWISHING KNIFE ) Put it back . ( STUTTERS ) No , no , no , no . Listen to me . BROTHER ADRIAN : Put it back . Now . I won 't ask you again . ( CRACKLING ) ARTIE : Claudia , get back ! ( WHIRRING ) ( CLAUDIA SCREAMS ) No ! ( CRACKLING ) Claudia ! CLAUDIA : Any luck out there , Pete ? Look , there 's no use trying to get in this way . It 's not just a cave-in , it 's a trap . We 'll never get past the iron gate . Gotta be a release switch or something to get her out of there ! All right . Claudia , can you see another way out ? CLAUDIA : No . My legs are trapped under the dirt anyway . I can 't move . I should have seen this ! It was so damn obvious ! What the hell was I doing ? You were getting Magellan 's Astrolabe , Artie . We only got half of it ! And at what price ? We 're already seeing the downside of this thing before we get any of the benefits from it . ( ARTIE SIGHS ) Artie , hey . We 're gonna get her out . There 's always a way , all right ? Yeah . Yeah . CLAUDIA : Don 't lose hope , guys . Just find the other part ! If you can make it work , I won 't ever have gone in here , right ? She 's right . We have to stay focused on the big picture . We have to erase the last 24 hours . Yeah , but where 's the other part ? The alidade . It wasn 't with the disk . I don 't know . It could be anywhere . It could be anywhere in the world . The watch . The writing on the watch was Portuguese . Right ? Magellan was Portuguese ! ARTIE : Barbosa was Portuguese . Duarte Barbosa , he was the captain of Magellan 's ship , Victoria . Well , don 't look at me . I was probably at wrestling practice . All right . Maybe there 's something on this watch , something that 'll connect it to this Astrolabe . Something that 'll tell us something ... Artie , look . ARTIE : And now it 's a watch again . Yeah , but that 's the wrong time . 4 : 18 ? 4 : 18 ? What 's the significance of that ? Could be longitude , latitude . 4 North , 18 East is literally the middle of the jungle in the Central African Republic . 4 South , 18 East is the middle of the Congo . We couldn 't get to either place in time anyway . 4 North , 18 West , middle of the Atlantic . 4 South , 18 West , ditto . Yeah , I remember . April 18th ? 1775 , Paul Revere 's ride . I don 't even have to look that one up . Uh , 1881 , Billy the Kid escaped from Lincoln County Jail in New Mexico . 1906 , San Francisco earthquake . 1923 , Yankee Stadium opened . 1930 , BBC announces that there 's no news to report that day . All right , maybe it 's not a date . Any other options ? Uh , the 418 area code is Quebec . KEELER : Uh , the year 418 , nothing happened of consequence . Well , what about military time , 1618 ? Does ... Or does that just complicate things ? I don 't know . No , you know what ? Never mind . No ! Wait . 1618 ! Chapter and verse ! Chapter and verse ! You guys sound excited . Did I solve it ? What if the " M " doesn 't stand for ... It doesn 't stand for Magellan . Looking for a book ... It stands for a book of ... BOTH : The Bible ! Leena . I 'm looking them up right now ! CLAUDIA : You know , the only M 's in the Old Testament are Micah and Malachi , and they don 't have a 16th chapter ! In the New Testament , it 'd be Mark or Matthew . They made us read the Bible a lot in the psych hospital . I think it 's how they kept their funding . LEENA : Mark 16 : 18 . " They shall take up serpents , " and if they drink any deadly thing , it shall not hurt them . " Man , I ... I really hope we don 't have to drink snake poison to find this thing . I mean , I 'll do it , but I 'm really hoping we don 't have to . KEELER : Artie ! Artie ! Matthew 16 : 18 . " And I tell you , you are Peter , " and on this rock I will build my church , " and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it . " Peter . On this rock . BOTH : The Vatican . The alidade is at the Vatican . KEELER : Listen to this , the cornerstone of Saint Peter 's Basilica was laid in 1506 , April 18th . Even I know that 's where it is . All right , you two keep looking for the peace artifact . LEENA : Don 't worry , we 'll find something . Bye . And , Artie , Artie , Artie ! Look . The watch is counting down again . What ? All right , we 've got exactly 8 hours and 57 minutes to get to Rome , break into the Vatican , get down to Saint Peter 's tomb , find the alidade . Well , let 's go . Uh ... I 'll stay . No , Mykes . I 'll stay . You ... CLAUDIA : Hey ! Are you guys still there ? Yeah , Claud , don 't worry . CLAUDIA : Why ? Get the hell out of here ! Forget about me . Just go get the thing and make it work ! Now ! Go now ! You should be gone already . Okay , Claud . We 'll get it , I promise . Or we 'll be back . ( SIREN WAILING ) ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) ( GRUNTS ) Hey ! No , no , no , Pete ! No , no , no ! No ! We 've got no time . We 've got less than two hours left . Artie , it 's getting worse , isn 't it ? Yes , yes . Because when there 's no hope , the people turn to fear and chaos takes over . Okay , this is the restaurant . Man , I 'm starving . Really , now ? We 're not here to eat . An army travels on its stomach . ( SIGHS ) ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Alberto ! Alberto , no , no , no ! No , no ! ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Whoa ! Okay . What are we even doing here ? Shouldn 't we be breaking into Saint Peter 's ? No , no , no . In the basement of Giancarlo 's , there is an old tunnel that leads directly into the bowels of the Basilica . People used to break into the Vatican ? Well , back when the tunnel was built , they more often used it to sneak out . All right , so how do we get past Brunhilda ? Yeah , exactly . You guys stay here . What ... What are you gonna do ? We 're running out of time and options . Okay ? So just get ready to find your tunnel . Oh man , I 've seen that look before . Just get your head down . ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) Go ! PETE : What ? Myka ! ( SPEAKING ITALIAN ) ( ALL GRUNT ) ARTIE : Let 's go ! Artie , she 's in trouble ! ( WHISPERS ) Go ! It 's now or never . Come on ! ARTIE : Saint Peter 's tomb is another level directly below us . The church has had it sealed off for over 100 years , but you know , if I remember , there is an elevator system . Okay . This is it . Oh , God . 30 minutes left . ( CREAKING ) Artie , I 'm getting some major vibe-age here . Good or bad ? I don 't know . Both . It 's weird . Good and then something ... Something ... Really dark . Wait . Huh . Look at that . Looks like an elevator to me . But how do we ... Wires . ( SIGH ) We need Claudia . No , no . The old dog 's still got a few tricks . ( CLANKS ) ( CRACKLING ) Ow ! ( GASPS ) God ! Looks like it singed your fur a bit there , scrappy . Yeah , and it didn 't do it . ( ELEVATOR WHIRRING ) Bingo . Now , that 's how you get down to Saint Peter 's tomb . What ? Vibe , Artie . ( SIGHS ) Big one . I don 't know . There 's something . Oh , my God . The alidade . Look in the mirror . The dial . It 's right here . ( SIGHS ) PETE : Oh , great . You guys again . ( ALL GRUNTING ) ( CRACKLING ) ( GRUNTS ) Yeah , yeah ! My partner taught me that one ! ( METAL CLANKING ) ARTIE : Behind you ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GASPS ) ( CRACKLING ) ( GRUNTS ) ( WHISPERS ) Pete ! I got it , Artie . I got it . Oh , my God . Should 've seen the other guy . ( GROANS ) I think ... I think he got me good , Artie . It didn 't hurt at first , but now it kinda does . It hurts bad . It really , really hurts , Artie . Yeah . Don 't do ... Don 't talk . Don 't talk . We just gotta stop this bleeding . But that was it , right ? That was what ... That was what you needed . We got it ? Yes , Pete . Okay . You got it . ( GROANS ) You got it . You got it . ( SOFTLY ) You got it . ( GRUNTS ) It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . Right ? Mmm-hmm , mmm-hmm . I 'm not gonna remember ? Remember what ? Remember dying . No . No . Pete . You won 't remember . But I will . ( WHISPERS ) I will . ( CLICKS ) Artie , what 's wrong ? Pete . He ... He , uh , found the alidade . So , we 're good to go . But we 're out of time , so please tell me you 've got something to counteract the bomb . Gandhi 's dhoti . The homespun cloth of cotton that the Mahatma wore during his fast for non-violence . I 've seen it in the inventory . It was snagged after he was assassinated . They say it emanates pure peace . We think it 's your best bet . All right . Wish me ... Wish us luck . Why ? Oh , my God . ( GASPS ) Please . Tell me why . I can 't . ( WHISPERS ) I 'm so sorry . Something 's happened ? Something ... Something irrevocable ? I believe I can fix it . I know I can . If you do this , you can tell no one . ( GASPING ) Anyone you tell of your actions will be in grave danger . All right . If you use the Astrolabe , you will create an evil of your own making . An evil that will live with you the rest of your days . Please ! ( WOMEN GRUNTING ) Artie ! Thank God ! Yes ! That was getting rather close . Uh ... Okay , listen . We have to find Sykes . Right ? He 's probably . What ? Artie ? What 's wrong ? Are you all right ? Yeah . ( STAMMERS ) I 'm good . Right , you were tied up . MYKA : What ? And now you 're free . Artie , what is wrong ? Nothing . Right . Uh , yeah . And there 's a bomb in Sykes ' wheelchair . MYKA : What ? There 's a bomb in Sykes ' wheelchair ! Why would he have a bomb inside his ... Well , because he wants to destroy the Warehouse . He wants to blow it up . Yes . Yes , that makes perfect sense . This is what he 's been waiting decades to ... How did you know about that ? We have to go to Aisle Rajghat 1948 ! We have to do that right now ! MYKA : Why do you always do that ? Artie ! H. G : Artie ! This is masonry from the British House of Commons ! Yeah ! It was infused with all the hatred of the Nazi regime during the blitzkrieg . Now , where is it ? Are you sure we even have Gandhi 's dhoti ? I mean ... Positive ! Now , there 's the spinning wheel ! And there 's the sandals ! There 're the glasses ! Where 's the damn ... Dhoti ! Got it ! Okay . But Artie , how did you even know about the bomb being in the wheelchair ? It was logical , and , uh , I think he may have mentioned it in passing . And how did you know about Gandhi 's dhoti ? You know what ? It doesn 't matter ! Ha ha ! MYKA : Ha ! ( SIGHS ) ( BEEPING ) It 's still counting down . No . It can 't be . It 's supposed to stop . Myka , if we don 't do something , this thing is gonna destroy the whole warehouse . Hey , don 't panic . All right ? You said that the bomb was fueled by hatred , right ? Yeah ! Well , we thought that the pure peace of Gandhi 's dhoti would counteract Hitler 's pure hatred . It 's not the bomb . What ? It 's not the bomb ! Of course ! The hatred . Right , so if hatred is what ignites the bomb , then we don 't need to defuse the bomb . We need to defuse Walter Sykes . Right . And Pete is about to push him through the portal . And he 's gonna be lost forever . Wait ! How do you know these things ? Get away from her ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ARTIE : No ! No , Pete , don 't ! No . Bring him back ! You have to bring him back ! Bring him back ! ( BOTH GRUNTING ) Myka . ( BOMB BEEPING ) ( BEEPING STOPS ) It stopped . ( GASPS ) I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . PETE : He 's gone . ADWIN : Agent Nielsen , you 'll have to be more specific . How can you be certain of H.G. Wells ' rehabilitation ? I know how all this sounds . But could you possibly just trust me on this ? Trust you on this ? That 's it ? Yeah , yeah . Look , she did save Myka 's life in Hong Kong . And the two of them did manage to reopen the portal , which ultimately saved us all . Right ? What H.G. Did was admirable , but one event doesn 't change history . You cannot have the Regents simply ignore the past . Why not ? The past isn 't written in stone , you know . Well , I mean , I know it 's written ... You know what I mean . MRS. FREDERIC : No . Actually , we don 't , Arthur . What are you talking about ? I mean , people change . They learn . They grow . She had any number of opportunities to bury us . She didn 't . Uh , I think , under an extreme circumstance , I can see Miss Wells behaving quite ... Heroically . I mean , if it came to it . This is a sudden and miraculous change of opinion . It 's quite unlike you . ADWIN : If I recall , in the past , you have been the most vocal opponent of Miss Wells having her freedom . ( STUTTERS ) Uh , yeah . Well ... My point is that in my gut I know that if she had to , H.G. Wells would give her life for the Warehouse . I know it . And I think I 've earned the occasional " I 'm gonna go with Artie 's gut on this , " don 't you ? Would you excuse us for a moment ? Oh , yeah , take all the time you need . Thank you . Oh . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) MRS. FREDERIC : We are inclined to " go with Artie 's gut on this , " as requested . This must , of course , be taken up with the rest of the Regents . Of course . But given your strong recommendation , I don 't foresee a problem . ( LAUGHS ) Thank you very much , Mr. Kosan . I appreciate it . Okay . Thank you . Got a lot of work to do . Something strange is going on . Well , it 's Warehouse 13 . I mean , isn 't something strange always going on ? Not like this . No doubt , you know what I mean . Arthur Nielsen at a loss for words ? You 've done something . Don 't be ridiculous . I didn 't do anything . Just ... I 'm not at a loss for words . I simply don 't have anything to say . I will tell you ... ( SIGHS ) Dear God . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) ( TRAINER WHIMPERS ) Don 't judge me . I didn 't have any choice , did I ? I haven 't slept in two parallel universes . I 'm exhausted . ( SIGHS ) BROTHER ADRIAN : You will create an evil of your own making . ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( ECHOING ) No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! ( GROANS ) ( GASPS ) Oh . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) LEENA : Artie , Claudia 's gone . She disappeared in the middle of the night . BROTHER ADRIAN : An evil that will live with you the rest of your days .

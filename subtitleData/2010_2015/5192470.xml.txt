Where are we from ? - Siegfried . - The earth . and when did we leave ? - Brunhilda . - 1945 . - And where did we go ? - The dark side of the moon . Brilliant . Don 't try to play dumb with me . It was your bad idea to send those idiots to the moon . - Talk about disaster . - Um , not to be the contrarian Madam President but I 'm pretty sure it was your idea . It was my great idea had they succeeded , now it 's your stupid idea . Got it ? I didn 't hire you for stupid ideas . I hire you because of your Midas touch . Now my approval ratings are in the toilet and that election is just weeks away . You dropped the ball , Vivian . Now , I need a miracle . Get me a miracle . Actually how was sending those two astronauts to the moon suppose to getting me re-elected ? Exactly ? We haven 't been to the moon for 50 years . One of them was black . - Thought it would look good . - Look good how ? Like I said , one of them was black . Just think of the opportunity we wasted years ago with that errand boy , Powell , Alan Powell ? - Colin Powell . - That was close . - And where are you going ? - The UN , to do my job . The Great Dictator by Charlie Chaplin . It is one of the world famous short films . which illustrates in just ten minutes , his wish that one day , the entire world would be held in the great Führer 's wise and gentle hands . - Any questions ? - I have a question . In my classroom we adhere to a strictly formal manner in addressing one another . To what do we owe the honor of this visit ? We capture an earthling . Your expertise is required . No , no no . I love me some sauerkraut . And Volkswagen . Huh ... Farfignugen . Hay ... German words , right . You know , it 's as if , where I come from , we speak German too . You know what I 'm sayin ' . Damn . Your gonna be sorry you did that white boy . You are a knock-out . How do I get out of here ? Thanks lady . Have a nice day . No , Mr. Subhuman . This is the air lock . No . You might wanna cover up a bit . All good ? No , no no . I wouldn 't do that if I was you . Listen to me , listen to me . I know a lot of important people . They 're very important people . I even know the President of the United States of America . Now now , if you kill me , then that 's just a really fucked up situation . You know the president of the United States of the Americas ? Thanks homie . I talk to you later baby . Question , what is this apparatus ? Look man , how would I know ? I 'm just model . - A model what ? Citizen ? - No man , a model model . Damn , what 's wrong with you two ? You blind or something ? Shit . - I 'm pretty . - Are you part of the shock troops before the invasion ? Invasion ? Man , you all must be tripping . What is your mission ? Look dude , I just follow the paycheck , you know what I 'm saying ? - What is this device ? - Oh , that 's my kick-ass cellphone . - and a computer . - What ? That is not a computer . This is a computer . No man . Dat 's ancient history , homie . I am telling you once again .. One moment we received conformation that the ship had landed successfully on the moon . The next , all communications stopped . - As though it had simply vanished . - Or you 're hiding something from us ? Yeah , we are hiding something on the dark side of the moon . I still find very difficult to believe that entire purpose of the mission was to promote your presidents re-election . Well , believe what you like , we had mere senators spend hundred-of-millions on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit posts . But Mr. Secretary , the expenses involved this time only makes sense if there was a military purpose . Okay , lets get this clear . The United States has no military activity on the moon . What about natural resources activity ? We know how the U.S. sometimes mixes the two up . Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium-3 up there ? Helium-3 ? You just made that up , didn 't you ? That 's so silly . I assume these are just preliminary idea ? Sir , we have a very small delivery window . - Sir ? - Yes , sir . Ma 'am , and this is all . Anyone who is not the head of a department , should leave . You idiots . You morons ! That 's an insult to morons . What is this shit ? I have a meeting with the President of the United fucking States of America tomorrow fucking morning . Not with the President of fucking Zambia . Not with the President of the fucking Janitor 's Union . But with the president of the fucking country which you just happen to be living in at the fucking moment . You pieces of hellacious shit . What am I suppose to tell her ? That my employees are not intelligent enough ... to be fucking morons ? Are you willing to work with the Führer ... in the name of the fatherland , stand behind the Wehrmacht . This decision does not resolve all of us ... Thank you . Thought my ears were gonna bleed . You 're welcome . May I ask what you name is ? Washington . James Washington . - What yours ? - Renate Richter . It is a pleasure to meet you , Washington . James Washington . What 's wrong with your skin ? Come on now , please . You have met a brother before , right ? - No , I 'm an only child . - No , I didn 't mean like that . I meant a black man . No and this continues to confuse me because you are much blacker when I first encountered you . Okay girl , look . Either I 'm black or you 're blind . Look , what is going to happen to me ? I mean , what 's with this guy that keeps sticking needles in me ? - What about that angry dude ? - My father 's sticking needles into you ? That freaking scientist guy ? That 's your dad ? And what about you know ... . Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs-Oberführer Adler ? - I 'm sorry , what ? - Klaus Adler . He 's going to be the next Führer . And my husband . What , did you lose a bet or something ? I mean ... Lucky you . Actually , lucky him . I shouldn 't even be here . Whoa , Whoa , Whoa . Now , you can not leave me tied up like this . - Please do me a favor . - What ? - Play a Nazi . - Well , if I don 't ? - They will eliminate you . - Oh great . Is there a different radio station ? With the upcoming war ... Okay , Mini-Manuel . Hey man , I don 't like the look of this . With the prisoner now being one of us , we will go down to the earth . He will help us to find more telephone computers . Return , and then get the Götterdämmerung flying . - You smell that ? - No . We don 't have time to waste . Take me to that president of yours . What ? The President ? Come on man , I thought you want me to take you to the Mac store or something . You said that you would know the President of these United States of the Americas . Right , of course . That President . May I meet this President too ? Hey , Miss Richter . Welcome to my planet . - Get the hell outta my property . - You better get outta here . Whoa , whoa whoa whoa . Now , hold on there Boss man . That may not be the sharpest move . Look , look . I 'll tell you what . Let me go talk to the brothers . All right ? They know me , you know . I 'm one of them . Are you with me ? Yeah , now you 're talking . Alright . Now . I 'm serious . You don 't know how good it is to see you all man . It 's like little Africa up in this bitch . Come on people . You all know me . I know you do . Washington . That ain 't one of you 'alls , is it ? Because ah ... Look man , you ain 't got to bring that shit out . Look man , it 's all good . Look , I 'm a peace loving brother , man . 185b 00 : 32 : 41,200 - - 00 : 32 : 42,400 Fuck it , man . Yo !

Oh no mother-effin way ! What did you sick sons-a-bitches do to me ? - I should 've told you . - What ? That I look like a fuckin ' polar bear ? You know what ? You two really , really know how to fuck up a guys Christmas . Quite , you fool ! What is wrong with you ? We made you Aryan , you 're one of us now . - You should be thanking us . - Thanking you ? What I should have done is let those brothers come here with their size 15s and put a foot so far up your ass , you can taste the toe nails for 2 fucking weeks . Klaus ! Bring me to your leader , James Washington . Hey , what the fuck ? Excuse me . Get your fuckin ' hands off me , you mother ... - Is she your boss ? - Yeah , she 's the big cheese . - And she knows the president ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . They real tight . Oh , Come on . You fuckin ' animal . Do you know who I am ? Huh ? Do you ? You just kidnapped the wrong woman . The wrong fucking woman . Oh yeah . I hope your having a good time . I 'm gonna kick your fuckin ' ass . Excellent . My turn . I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich . We are based on the moon . I 'm told you know the president of these United States of the Americas . You will take us to that President , because ... - I have a very special present for him . - Him ? Well he 'll loved that . He just loves presents . As soon as my mission is accomplished . The Nazi invading forces will be called in under my directions and we will end the good times for the bad people . And just how do you propose to do that ? - We 'll simply eliminate them . - What ? - Sorry , that is not what we are told . - Renate , I don 't think that you ... Yeah . Why not ? Why don 't you tell you this fräulein why we 're here . Just like you keep telling your pupils . I would love to do that . You see ... the National Socialist Party is the people 's party , nothing more . We wish to return to earth with our message of peace and unity , love through virtue and kindness , for example . We are healthy , in mind and body . Our spirits are brave and true . And we achieve because we are strong , and disciplined in our cause . There 's simply no belief that can match ours . Because peace and unity is the gift we bring to all mankind . - What you and all earthlings need to know ... - Yeah , yeah . I get it . This is good . This is gonna work . You , I need . And you ... I want . Alright , let 's go meet the president . Madam President ... Here is the miracle you asked for . - Who is this man ? - He will lead the campaign troops . Renate , please ... This is very simple . The world is sick ... but we are the doctors . The world is anemic , and we are the vitamin . The world is weary , but we are the strength . We are here to make the world healthy once again . With hard work ... with honesty , with clarity , with decency . We are the product of loving mothers and brave fathers . We are the embodiment of love and bravery . We are the gift of both God and science . We are the answer to the question . We are the promise delivered to all mankind . For that we raise our hand , to one nation . We step to the beat of one drum ... . of this world . We are the people with the children on our shoulders . In the same way as our fathers carried us and their fathers before them . We are the one people , united and strong . We are the one people with certainty . Moral certainty . We are invincible and we have no fear . Because the truth makes us one . Hey ! The moon Nazis are coming . What 's wrong with you people , can 't you see ? Look , I 've been there . I 'm telling you . They have all this moon base , they got this whole like space thing goin ' on , and they comin ' to take over . Oh , you never listen to this right ?

I 'm seeing what appears to be weapons of some-kind dangling down from the bottom . Oh my God . It 's opening fire , it 's opening fire . I 'm getting the hell out of here . There is little information . But here 's what we know at this time . - Ok , you see , the thing is , that Klaus ... - I know it was your doing . - It 's wonderful . - It 's wonderful ? It 's brilliant . I 'm a wartime president now . All presidents who start war in their first term always get re-elected . I thought I was gonna have to bomb Australia or something .

Good work , take it to Officer Tyler please . Trajectory , what 's our status on the orbit window ? Commander on deck . The hostile fleet have launched a full scale aerial attack against the United States . These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they are operating fully within the thermosphere . Each of them carry approximately 200 enemy vessels and are extremely ... Hell hath no fury , Heir Adler . Alright kiddies . Let 's get this show on the road . Vivian , you look great . How is it going up there ? Madam President , I couldn 't be better .

Let ' em see what that baby can do . Working at optimum capacity . Ammo consumption within tolerance . We 're coming under extremely heavy fire . Were gonna need reinforcements right now . What the hell is the meaning of this ? Good day mates . This is Australian ship , Dundee 01 . Ready to kick ass . Spitfire reporting in . Hang in there W. Canada joining your battle . This is a direct violation of this nations space treaty that you all signed , every single one of you . MIR join in za battle . That is suppose to be destroyed . This is an outrage . You 're all liars , just like my ex ex-husband . - Come down lady , come down . - Don 't you lady me , Pinko . Okay , who didn 't arm their spaceships ? Oh Great , great . That 's just great . - You all gave me your word . - But you broke yours . We always break ours , that 's just what we do . Okay fine . Fine , fine , fine , fine . Let just beat shit out of these pricks and ah , talk about the details later . This is beautiful . - Where the hell are we goin ' ? - To the Götterdämmerung . I think Klaus will be there . What did you think of that , Heir ? Alright , what about this moon business . What do you say we head on over and slap them around a bit . Klaus baby , I coming to get ya ' . - What the hell is this place ? - This is the Götterdämmerung . It will liberate the earth . Actually .

You like me . We have a visual on the Nazi fortress , commander . Obvious and overstated as usual , Klaus . Alright everyone , let 's get those nukes in action . - I 'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone . - But Commander , there are woman and children done there . The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . - Prime warheads on secondary armament . - Roger that . - Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment . - Fire the fucking nukes . Nukes away . Job well done . Hey quack ! Remember me ? The moon spook you turned into a snowflake . Oh shit , it 's alive . He sure must have the smallest dick in the universe . Time ... to fuck back . Everyone , take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire . - Offensive run confirmed . - Let her rip . 483b 01 : 12 : 53,800 - - 01 : 12 : 54,500 Fuck it ! - Washington , do you hear me ? Washington . - Renate . Was that you ? - You need to shut down the engines . - I 'm working on it . Congratulations . High five . Well that was disappointing . Do you think he suffered ? Even just a little ? Vivian , I knew you could do it . You 're foxy and salacious , all the way . Congratulations . - What 's Helium-3 ? - Helium . Did you say Helium-3 ? Yes , there like about 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of the stuff . - That 's ours . - It is ? Why ? Helium-3 will make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for the next thousand years . Yes , it 's ours . No , no no . Hear me out . Hear me out . The moon is American soil . Moon flag , star and stripes . Who beat the moon Nazis ? We did . Well , yeah yeah , alright , you help out here and there , but ultimately it 's just like World War II ... and who won that ? We did . - You lie . - You don 't believe me ? Watch the movies . Movies don 't lie . Not the shoes , Jesus . Vivian , this is the Secretary of Defense . - Defend and hold that Helium-3 at all costs . - But against who ? Against everybody . Unfortunately that 's the story of revenge . It 's messy . Never really works out the way you want it to . I feel lonely . The eternal love of God , the love of God into our hearts , or we will burn ... burn in hell , burning in eternal damnation . Renate . Washington . You are alive . It 's okay . It 's okay . And you are the way you 're meant to be . Are you aware that you are kissing a black man ? I guess you have a lot of work cut out for you .

 We were able to identify 23 chromosomes your grandson inherited from his mother . Hopefully that 's enough to activate the machine . Previously on Fringe : The machine came on by itself without Peter . The vortex appeared above this field . If it 's the end , this is just the beginning . That machine was made for me . We thought I could turn the machine on . Maybe I can turn it off . I think this is what I 'm supposed to do . - I was never good at letting you go . - This time you have to . Peter ! Peter , I 'm here , son . You 're up . Of course . I was just resting my eyes . How is he ? - His pulse is strong . - I just spoke with Dr. Levin . She 's planning on keeping him sedated for at least another 12 hours . She thinks the fact that his vitals are stable is a very positive sign . She 's hopeful he 's gonna come out without any damage . She can 't possibly know that . Peter interacted with a machine of immense power . A surge like that could 've disrupted his neural patterns created memory deficits , aphasia ... - Walter . Let 's wait and see , okay ? How about we go for a walk ? You know you haven 't eaten in hours . The cafeteria 's just downstairs . I think I saw tapioca pudding on the menu . All right . I can 't deny I 'm hungry . Riders on the storm Riders on the storm Hey , Dad . Something weird just happened . - What 's up , Nate ? - Are you feeling sick ? No , I ... What the hell was that ? - Are you okay , Nate ? - I think so . It 's okay , buddy . It 's over . Wait here . I 'm gonna take a look . - Gary , no ! - You 'll be safe in the car . Just stay down , don 't touch anything . It wasn 't supposed to happen this way . - What do you mean " this way " ? - It 's already on . It 's been on for 32 hours . But how can that be ? This doesn 't make sense . Walter thinks that the machines are quantum entangled and that this machine was triggered when they activated theirs . Even so , how did they turn it on in the first place ? This machine was built for Peter . Only he can operate it . He tried , but the machine sent him flying . Hotwired . It 's tricked into thinking he 's inside . That 's why it 's repelling anyone or anything trying to enter . So you 're thinking it 's malfunctioning ? What I 'm saying is it 's frustrated , in a manner of speaking . That 's why you 're seeing all this damage . It 's not a doomsday device , but it 's acting like one . Okay . So how do we stop it ? In case of emergency , break glass . I believe there 's a way we can disarm the force field and let Peter in safely . Okay , I read the First People book and there 's nothing in it about that . Not in your book . This is the manuscript the books are based on . - These pages were never published . - Okay , so , what am I looking at ? This is a box . This is the key that opens the box . - But what 's inside the box ? - According to this , a crowbar of sorts . - A crowbar ? - Yes . It 'll pry the force field open long enough for Peter to get in . And what happens if he does ? Does he die ? - No . I don 't think so . - You don 't think so ? As I understand it , the machine is indestructible . So if Peter gets in , he should be safe . - Okay , so where are these now ? - Come on . It 's been a long time since I 've seen a classic fruit cocktail . Why do you suppose that is ? I suppose loading fruit with sugar , artificial flavors and dyes has just fallen out of favor . - That 's a shame , isn 't it ? Not a fire , it 's a freak lightning storm . I need you to call the Burn Center and see how many they can take . Second-degree burns . Trauma 4 is ready . It 's getting worse . We don 't know this has to do with the machine . - Let me know how many casualties . - I think we do . - I want another team , get the governor . - What happened ? Dry lightning storm outside Worcester . Twenty-five people injured and similar storms reported up the Eastern Seaboard . Electrostatic fluctuations in the atmosphere . I 'm not surprised . Sorry . I have to take this . Yes , put him through . Mr. Governor . - We should get back to Peter . - This is a Fringe event . - We need to get to the lab . - I 'm not leaving . Peter would not want you to do nothing . I 'll make sure the hospital calls us . - We 'll be back before he wakes up . - I 'm out of ideas . Forgive me if I 'd like to spend my remaining time with my son . What about Olivia ? You saw how hard it was for her to leave him . But she 's out trying to find a way to end this . I , too , have tried . I went so far as to ask God for help . - How did he respond ? Nothing . - That 's your excuse ? Come on , now . What have you done , Walter ? God helps those who help themselves . - Poor Richard 's Almanack . - What ? Ben Franklin . That was his phrase . " God helps those who help themselves . " You 're right . We have to investigate . We can 't begin to neutralize this until we understand . - Where are we going ? - To get my kite . - The thing is , I 'm not the first Sam Weiss . - So which Sam Weiss is this ? My great , great , great , great grandfather . He was digging for mastodon bones when he discovered an ancient manuscript instead . - So he wrote the First People book ? - That was the fifth Sam Weiss . The third and fourth Sams spent their lives searching for the missing sections . You 're a dedicated bunch . A machine with the power to create and destroy worlds shouldn 't be taken lightly . Dang , this is heavy . Okay , let 's go get the key . No . Maybe we shouldn 't be doing this at all . The crowbar is not to be used unless something goes wrong . Look outside , Sam . Something is going wrong . The timeline is not right . Maybe this is a cosmic hiccup . - Maybe it will course correct . - Or maybe destroy two universes . That 's exactly my point . Generations of knowledge have been bestowed upon me . No one said anything about the Other Side turning on the machine first . Okay , Sam , I 'm gonna make this easy . I am armed and I want you to take me to the key now . Ho , ho ! That 's it , come and get me ! Strike me down , you sprites , you elves , you glorious blue jets ! Walter , this can 't possibly be safe . Nonsense , I 'm fully insulated . Are you tracking the field strength ? Yeah . It 's all over the place . The needle won 't sit still . Ahh ! Oh ! Whoo ! What was the voltage on that one ? Uh ... I 'm gonna go with " high . " - We 're not getting any more readings . - What about barometric pressure ? Walter ! Oh , my God ! Hey . Hey . Walter . - What happened ? - You just got struck by lightning twice . That 's it . The missing variable . - Oh , Ostrich , you are a genius . - Why ? Repetition , my dear . We have to account for repetition . Pack all this up . We 're going back to the lab . - Okay . - Ha , ha ! ICU . We 've got two , maybe three free beds . You 're gonna have to send some of them to General . Sir ? You all right ? What 's your name ? My name 's ... Are you a patient ? I need a crash cart in here . Don 't move . I 'll be right back . Taxi ! - Where you headed , pal ? - Forty-second and Lex , please . - Come again ? - Forty-second and Lex . Midtown . Are you feeling okay ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Why ? Forty-second and Lexington is in New York , and we are in Pittsfield . That 's a pretty steep fare . Forty-second and Lex , it is . Appears we 've got another problem . The key 's in there , the Whitley Museum . Mayor 's office has us setting up safety zones at the locations of the storms . So , what 's the radius ? Six blocks . We 've had bigger . Quincy , Somerville , two at Southie . I barely have the manpower to keep up . That 's her , museum director . I don 't care . I 'm not leaving my museum unattended . You remember what happened in Baghdad . I 'll call back . - This is the agent I spoke to you about . - Olivia Dunham . FBI . - Dr. Christine Albright . - Sam Weiss . Patron member since ' 82 . Thank you so much for meeting us . Are those the floor plans ? Mm-hm . - There . That 's where the key is . - You sure ? - Positive . - That 's the Native American wing . I curated those exhibits myself . There 's no key . - I beg to differ . - Okay , what 's the most direct route that way ? You want to go in ? You can 't , it 's not safe . Never seen anything like it . - Lightning coming out of thin air . - Inside the museum ? - Inside all the buildings on the block . - That 's a chance we 're gonna have to take . Go through the front entrance . That 's the quickest route . Please , be considerate . We 've lost enough priceless artwork for one day . You have our word . Here 's everything , including the latest raw data from Massive Dynamic . Excellent . Let 's mark all the spots where lightning has struck more than once . Because lightning shouldn 't strike twice ? That 's a myth , as we know . Lightning can and does strike twice , given the right conditions . But the frequency of multiple strikes , that , we measure . - This is gonna give us the pattern ? - No , not by itself . But when we compare it to the frequency of seismic events and multiple radiation and thermal spikes maybe . Okay . Seismic and radiation . And thermal . What do you see , dear ? These X 's line up perfectly . What else ? Fringe events seem to be clustered around two points . The foci , and a rift seems to be forming in the axis between them . Like they 're tugging at each other . This is where our machine is housed . But why Liberty Island ? Walternate . Do you understand what you 're suggesting ? We 're talking mass panic . Do you have a contingency plan in place for that ? Hold on . I 'll call you back . Here we go . A simple visual demonstration . It 's important that you pay attention . These two magnets create a magnetic field between them . As a result , these iron filings line up in a pattern consistent with that field . - Your point ? - The two machines . They 're acting just like the magnets . Only in this case , across universes . The pull between them creating this swath of events . At one end , the hangar where we keep our machine . The other end , Liberty Island . The Department of Defense headquarters on the Other Side . Where Walternate must have built his machine . No other explanation . But if we move our machine to the same spot as theirs we slow the pace of destruction . You wanna move our machine 100 miles and over water and park it offshore from the most populated city in the country ? Yes . Astrid 's already working out the logistics for stable transport . But when the machines are together , won 't that increase the intensity ? Yes , but it will buy us time . Olivia 's looking for a way to get Peter inside the machine . We have to contain the damage until she succeeds and pray that Peter is ready . Phillip . I know it sounds crazy but it 's our only viable option . - There it is . - The key ? I don 't see it . That 's the beauty . No one can . Sam . Do you hear that ? - Is it the lights ? - It 's not the lights . Get down ! You get the key . I 'll disable the alarm . It 's not working . It was short circuited by the lightning . We won 't make it . - Oh , my God , Sam . - I work in a bowling alley . Okay , come on . That 's the key ? - Incredible . - Okay , so , what do I do ? I don 't know . I told you , the instructions are incomplete . There 's nowhere for it to go . Are you sure this is the right key ? Are you kidding ? My father took me to the museum hundreds of times . Believe me , you have no idea how boring that ... You did it . Sam . That 's the crowbar ? What is it ? It 's you . What does the drawing mean , Walter ? And why am I in it ? Well , if it 's a companion to the original picture it means that you and Peter both have a connection with the machine . But why ? I mean , why am I connected to it ? Perhaps your friend here could enlighten us . All I know is the original manuscript was very clear on this point . The lock box contains the crowbar . Then the answer is unavoidable . You have the ability to turn off the force field that 's keeping Peter out . Open the machine long enough for him to get inside . How am I supposed to do that ? The answer lies in the drawing . Otherwise , why draw it ? Let 's see . Brain waves , it would seem . - Hey , careful with that . - Mm-hm . There 's your answer . You , Olivia , have the power to bend things with your mind . That 's what you 're doing if you look at it the right way . - You 're not seriously talking about ... - Telekinesis . - I can 't . - Yes , you can . You 've done it before . Two years ago . David Robert Jones . She defused a bomb by turning off some lights with her mind . - That was different . - Less advanced . Though I 'm afraid there 's something else . Since it 's the machine on the Other Side that 's turned on that 's the machine you 'll have to interact with . You 're not suggesting I need to cross over ? No . The same part of your mind that allows you to cross over contains your ability of telekinesis . They should be able to work together in combination . To control the machine over there from over here . - In theory , yes . - No , it 's ridiculous . And even if it was possible , manipulating a light is nothing compared to manipulating the machine . Right , of course . Requires a much greater degree of control . We have to practice . Start on something smaller . How do we do that ? This is the typewriter that the other Olivia used to communicate with the Other Side . Like the machines , it is quantum entangled with its counterpart . In this case , whatever 's typed on one appears on the other which makes it the perfect means for testing your abilities . - You ready to give it a try ? - So how ? Okay , clear your mind . Look into the mirror . Imagine that you are looking at the typewriter on the Other Side . Now , press those keys using your mind . - Walter , this is ... - Don 't expect it to happen quickly . It 's like meditating . You need to focus on something specific . A word . A phrase . And be patient . Okay . Walter , maybe if you gave me some Cortexiphan . At this point , it would do you more harm than good . These abilities are inside you , Olivia . You simply need to harness them . Walter , I don 't know how . I never have . I know what it 's like to feel unequal to the task required of you . To feel incapable . I 'll never be the man I was but I 've come to embrace those parts of my mind that are peculiar . Broken . I understand now that 's what makes my mind special . I wish you could see yourself the way I see you . You have no idea how extraordinary you are . If you can embrace that , there 's no end to what you can do . I know that you want to believe in me . And I want to believe in me . But believing doesn 't make it true . Just try . It 's okay . Take a break and try again . Hm ? The hospital just called . Peter 's missing . Excuse me . Do you ... ? Excuse me . Do you know if there 's a pawn shop around here ? - I 've been here before , but ... - Sorry , man . I 'm sorry to disturb you , but ... It 's really important . - I could have sworn there was one ... - I don 't know . I think there 's one over on Third Avenue . On Third ? Thank you . - Can I see these ? - Sure . You a collector ? I was . When I was a kid . They 're graded and authenticated . Price-wise , everything in here , 500 and up . This one . Silver half dollar . It 's my favorite . It always brings me luck . Walter , they searched the house . There 's no sign of him . What if he can 't remember our address ? - Walter , let 's not assume the worst . - Is that what you think I 'm doing ? Because it is a fact that Peter sustained a massive blow to the head . It is a fact that he was in a hospital less than 10 hours ago . It is a fact we haven 't got the slightest clue how that machine affected him . So please , do not accuse me of making assumptions . I 'm sorry , Astrid . I know you 're scared , Walter . Okay . Peter 's credit card has been used twice in the past two hours . Eight hundred dollars to the Western Massachusetts Cab Company and $ 600 to a pawn shop in Manhattan . - He took a cab to New York . - It appears so . Until we speak to the driver , we won 't know . What would he be looking for in New York ? - You can 't be here . We 're evacuating . - I have to talk to my father . - I have something to show him . - Who is your father ? Walter Bishop . The secretary of defense . - Thank you . Any word from Peter ? - No . - What are you doing ? - Reading . That 's a lie . I 'm trying to read . A pathetic attempt to distract myself with ancient gossip . Better than thinking about what I 've done . - Sam , you didn 't do anything . - I intervened . - I didn 't give you an option . - We just got word Peter 's been found . - Is he all right ? - He 's alert , answering questions . Transport 's waiting for us . - Where is he ? - Liberty Island . - The machine has arrived there . - I 'll get my coat . And some Dramamine . This is where you get off . Official personnel only . Sam , whatever 's happening , it 's not over . - Good luck , Olivia . - Thank you . Peter , what on earth made you come here ? Are you all right , son ? There are two of you , aren 't there ? I think I 've been confused . - What year is it ? - 2011 . - President ? - Obama . Nausea , headaches , ear ringing ? Physically I feel fine . And who is that woman over there ? Olivia . What 's the last thing you remember before you woke up in the hospital ? I remember getting into the machine . Or trying to . Good . And do you know me ? I know you 're not the secretary of defense . The sweater 's a dead giveaway . Good . The fact that your memory 's returning is a sign that your confusion is temporary . You 're gonna be okay , Peter . Where did you get this ? Walter ? The machine . I thought you had a plan to contain the pressure . The system wasn 't designed for sudden fluctuations . What can we do to compensate ? I 'm afraid so long as the machine is on , there is nothing we can do . Oh , Peter , I was worried about you . I 'm okay . Let 's just figure this out . The drawing implies you need to use telekinesis ? Is Walter sure ? Well , Walter 's educated guess is as good as we have . Well , I mean , I 've tried . I concentrated on a phrase like Walter asked me to do and , still , nothing . Well , what was the phrase ? - What do you mean it 's working ? - I heard the keys tapping away . It keeps typing the same message . Are you doing that ? - What 's the message ? - " Be a better man than your father . " There 's a boat leaving in five minutes . I want all non-essential personnel on it . That means get out now ! Don 't worry . Just think of it as a giant typewriter . - Do you know what to do ? - I think so . - The tremors are getting stronger . - Exponential micro-quakes . Building towards a massive event . I suspect we don 't have much time left . Walter , what if I can 't do it ? What if I can 't turn it off ? I have known you for a long time , Olivia . And I believe that the drawing was no accident . Whoever did it knew the same as I do that you don 't fail . You ready ? No . You ? No . Don 't say I never took you anywhere . You can do this . Notify the secretary . There 's something happening to the machine . You did it . Peter . I love you . Wish me luck . Dear God . All civilians please evacuate immediately . Agent Bishop ! Agent Bishop , take cover ! Fringe Division ? - Where the hell am I ? - Sir , you 've been hit . Medic ! I need a medic now !

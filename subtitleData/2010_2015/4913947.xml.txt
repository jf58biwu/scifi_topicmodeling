 This plan will restore us and rid the world of the Observers . Previously on Fringe ... A man came here and went down into the mine . - His name was Donald . - I don 't know any Donald . He was taken away against his will by two invaders . You never know when to give up . Why would we get her back just to lose her again ? Their abilities are aided by tech . I would be ten times what you are if I had that tech in my head . Hello , it 's me . But you know that already . This is tape seven . I don 't have much time , so I 'm going to show you how to get the next piece of the plan and explain on the way . I am on Quincy Street heading south . I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be a little late getting back . Didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file , and then I 'm out of here . So I 'll see you soon . I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be a little late getting back . Didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file , and then I 'm out of here . So I 'll see you soon . How did you get here ? The monorail . You didn 't come home this afternoon . You weren 't answering your comm . Yeah , I turned it off . I wasn 't going to stay for that much longer . I just needed to see her . I 've thought about coming here too . I feel closer to her here . No , it 's okay . Play it . Play it . I just wanted to let you know I 'm gonna be a little late getting back . Didn 't want you guys to worry . I 've got one more report to file , and then I 'm out of here . So I 'll see you soon . Peter , when you feel like this , I just want you to include me . It 's fine that you come here . Just tell me . I want to understand what you 're going through , and I want you to understand what I 'm going through . You 're right . I 'm sorry . What is that ? When we collapsed the corridor , one of the Observers nicked me . It 's okay . I 'm fine . Here we are . 167 Cedar Street . Now we need to make our way to the fourth floor . Apartment 413 . Hopefully without running into this tyrannical ... You again . You 're a friend of that renter up on four , aren 't you ? More of a colleague . I don 't know what you 're doing up there in that apartment , but if I hear any more strange noise , I 'm calling the super . - Do I know you ? - I need to get into apartment 413 . Is it occupied ? Fourth floor has been red-tagged for 20 years . Nobody goes up there . What 's your business here ? None of yours . _ . • ´ ¯ ¯ LIAISON ¯ ¯ ` • . _ ¯ ` • . _ _ Team _ _ . • ´ ¯ Retrouvez-nous chaque semaine ... pour découvrir les énigmes de 505 : Through the Looking Glass and What Walter Found There Bon épisode ... I was wondering where everybody was . Have you seen Walter ? - No , why ? - I went in to wake him up . His bed has not been slept in . He 's not in the cold storage . He also left the amber laser on and on the floor . The tape we were working on last night is already out of the amber . I think he left . He knows better than to go out alone . What the hell is he thinking ? At the moment , I am on Quincy Street heading south . The red line to Worcester Union Station . - Whatever mode ... - Maybe he 's gone off to follow this tape . He 's retracing his steps ? I have created , or rather , we have created a unique and efficient hiding place for a critical piece of the plan to defeat the Observers . It is undetectable to the Observers ' instruments . As I have mentioned ... May I help you ? As I mentioned , I have had some experience with transversing parallel universes . What we have done is we have opened a space in the membrane that separates the two universes . A " pocket universe " , if you will . This is very important . Do not , under any circumstances ... Is that raspberry filling ? Raspberry , is it ? Two . Since the pocket universe exists in inter-dimensional space , many of the usual laws of physics won 't apply . And there are few places on Earth where two plus two does not equal four . And this is one of them . It can be quite disturbing . Try not to worry about it . This tape will guide you every step of the ... Here we are . 167 Cedar Street . Cedar Street ? That 's downtown Worcester . Apartment 413 ... 167 is in the Q9 district . That whole neighborhood has been bombed out . It 's mostly abandoned . Hi , Walter . Take this . My arms are getting tired . Donald ... Donald ? That was the name of the man that was waiting for Walter , 21 years ago ? Your eyes are not deceiving you . The effect is caused by light refracted off ... Never mind , that 's not important . But down here , these lines denote the trans-dimensional demarcation . They 'll prove useful . You will need to refer to them . Donald , leave the camera with me . I realize , whoever you are , that this must seem very complicated . It is . Extremely . But don 't fret . It will all become clear once we 're safely inside . The sequence goes like this . Now , kick out 90 degrees to the right . Back 2 meters . And then to the left . And pivot 210 degrees to the left . And step out . What happened ? And step out . Is it damaged ? I don 't see any grinding or flecks of amber . Maybe they just stopped recording . It doesn 't make any sense . If Walter 's gone to retrieve whatever it is that 's in this pocket universe , then why would he go alone ? I don 't know . It 's not like him . Not that way . Are you Donald ? No , I 'm Cecil . How did you get here ? Do you know how to get out of here ? Yes , I do . And you 'll never know if you keep threatening me . How did you end up here , Cecil ? I was in one of the apartments . The Resistance must have been in the area because the in ... the invaders hit the whole block with light bombs , and ... the last thing I remember was a flash . - And then I woke up here . - You were blown into here . The force of the explosion of the light bombs must have blown you here , which is most likely why you 're still alive . When did this happen ? I don 't know . I 've been here five days . Five days ? But how have you survived ? There 's no food here , no water . There 's water . Show me . It 's mine . If you hope to ever get out of here , you will show me . - You sure this is the right place ? - I 'm sure . Don 't worry , you won 't fall . I 've managed almost half a cup every night . Something behind this wall . Perhaps some kind of refrigeration unit . That 's what 's causing the condensation . No , I 've been all around this place every which way . There 's nothing on the other side of this wall . I 'd like to have a look for myself . Follow me . What I 'd like to know is how you know your way in and out of here . 'Cause I 've been here before . I just can 't remember it . I 'm surprised he made it up there . Walter 's full of surprises today . I thought we were leaving . Not until I find what I came for . For a while , I thought this was purgatory . What have you done to deserve that ? The apartment I was in wasn 't mine . I was stealing things . I wouldn 't have been there otherwise . What could be worth stealing in those bombed out apartments ? They weren 't bombed out when I got there . You 've been here five days , right ? Those apartments are condemned . The building was blown up 20 years ago . - What year is it ? - It 's 2016 . It 's 2036 . What are you talking about ? Perhaps , in some way , you are in purgatory . This is a pocket universe . Time and space loop in on themselves here . So you can 't get out . That 's why it just seemed like days to you . My wife is waiting for me . Not anymore . Let 's go . Look at these footprints . He was here . He must have gone into the pocket . Kick out 90 degrees to the right . There 's only one way to find out . 2 meters , and then to the left . And pivot 210 degrees to the left . And step out . Donald , how are we doing ? Am I in focus ? Not yet . I 'll wait . Look at this . Back in the lab , it went to black . It was the end of the tape . And now there 's more footage . How is that possible ? You are now in the pocket universe . Don 't be alarmed . You will notice that things work differently here . You 'll see a door . Go through it . You 'll see a long hallway . - Turn ... - Left , Walter . Left . Thank you , Donald . Looks like something Walter would 've designed when he was tripping . Follow me . What you 're about to find is very important . Captain Windmark , I 've just been alerted . Walter Bishop has been sighted in Quadrant 9 . You are certain ? Now , reaching the hallway , turn right . Not left . If you continue on to where the hall you 're in dead-ends , you will find that it 's not a dead end at all . - Are you getting this , Donald ? - Yes , Walter . Because it doesn 't look like the camera 's recording . - It 's fine , Walter . - But the light 's not on . He 's right . This way . Walter , wait . What 's wrong ? Why aren 't you coming ? Oh , dear . Are you afraid ? They 're not alone . There 's nothing to be afraid of . - He 's talking to somebody else . - It 's someone besides Donald ? Yeah , look . His eye line is different . And what Alice found there ? This place is like that . There 's nothing in there . Wait there . You know you 're not supposed to leave the lab alone . I 'm so sorry . I don 't understand . All I thought about was retrieving what was on that tape . I couldn 't think about anything else . All I cared about was finding the next piece of the plan . Is that Donald , Walter ? No , it 's collateral damage . That 's Cecil . He is completely irrelevant to the plan ! What 's he doing here ? He ended up here through a series of unfortunate events . He was blown here by an explosion . When ? 20 years ago , but for him , it 's only been days . Everything within this pocket wraps in on itself , including time . That 's why we have to hurry and find whatever it is I hid here . There 's more on the tape . You can 't see it until you enter the pocket . Of course . The time anomalies wouldn 't allow the camera to operate properly . Let me see . The key is ... to know what you 're looking for . In this case , we 're looking for the apple . The forbidden fruit . The root of all knowledge . It will mark the place where you 'll be staying ... for what , I promise , will be a short time . And it will be safe and comfortable , I assure you . Who is that ? You honestly don 't recognize him ? It must have been wiped from my mind , like the other parts of the plan . No , Walter , it was a case that we worked . The boy , he was living underground . A demolition site . Maybe Walter didn 't experience the case in the same way that we did . Is he one of them ? An Observer ? Well , at first , we thought that he was just a boy . But then he started to exhibit empathic abilities . - He helped us find a murderer . - An empath . Remarkable . Why would I need an empath ? I don 't know . It was 20 years ago . But not for him . Like Cecil , to him , he 's only been waiting for days . Like I said on the tape , we used this place to hide him , to keep him safe until someone could return for him . Press play , Peter . Show me more . We 're nearly there . Now we 're looking for an apple . This one . What 's that , Donald ? These markings are very strange . Of all the things we 've seen in here , that 's what you find strange ? There 's the hand . Well , I wonder where it could be ? Here we are ! There it is . Just wait here now . Donald , please . Here it is . He 's not here . Where is he ? Where is he ? We designed this room just for you . You must stay here and wait for us to return and get you . For us , it could be quite a long time , but ... for you , it will seem like no time at all . Now you see where we 've kept him . To understand his purpose , refer to tape eight . You definitely left him here . Maybe Donald moved him . It has been 20 years . I think this is a portable air-degradation unit . So he was an Observer . What difference does it make ? He 's gone . Do you understand ? He was a part of the plan somehow . And without all of the parts , the plan is useless ! - Walter , calm down . - No , it 's too late ! They must have gotten this out of my mind . Windmark ! He must have found the boy ! Everything we 've done is for nothing ! For nothing . Search parameters remain the same . Building to building ... Door to door . There you are . If the Observers had known about this pocket , they would have shut it down a long time ago . The only person other than you that knew this place existed and how to navigate it is Donald . That makes sense . But why would he move the boy ? I don 't know . Maybe he thinks you 're dead . We were missing for a long time . And you have no idea who Donald is , where you met him , nothing ? We have to find him . Donald . Whoever he is . It 's the only way we 'll ever know for sure . I think I 've got something . It 's not there . Did you see this radio anywhere in that room ? I think whoever took the boy left this behind . Purposely ? Batteries must be dead . Or it doesn 't work in this pocket . Like the video camera , things work differently here . - So once we get it outside ... - Of course . That 's brilliant , Olivia . And perhaps it will somehow help us get to Donald . Assuming he 's still alive . - So should we get out of here ? - Please . Come on , guys . Walter , we have to move . Back down the stairs . Go . Go ! Stop . This way . That 's it . You found it , Peter . Olivia , cross right here . You okay ? Olivia , move . There 's no time . Get Walter out of here . I 'll draw them off and meet you at the monorail . Go ! I know what you have done . You have made a grave mistake . You do not realize what is happening to you . Clear the walkway . The doors are closing . He 's not coming . We gotta go back for him . - How 'd you do that ? - Do what ? Get us out of there ? How 'd you find your way back to the portal ? I don 't know , but I 'll take it . Please take your seats . What 's wrong ? This radio was left for us in the pocket universe . Look , the tuning dial has been jammed . It 's , like , stuck on one frequency . Why ? Nothing 's being transmitted . Not yet . You okay , Walter ? I can 't stop thinking about that man . All he wanted was to get out of there . And I didn 't help him . I didn 't care about him . All I cared about ... Saving the world . You are not responsible for that man 's death . He died 20 years ago , the night he broke into that apartment and the light bomb went off . If it wasn 't for your pocket , he would have died then and there . Perhaps . I saw a man ... half-starved . And I used him because it suited me . Because he was nothing more than an acceptable loss as long as I got what I needed . Is that who I am , Peter ? Is that something you can see coming from my mind ? From my heart ? Am I the person that would ... leave in the middle of the night on his own ? Those are the actions of a man of hubris , arrogance . That 's not me , Peter . It 's him . Him ? Don 't you see ? I 'm not safe . It 's my mind . Ever since the pieces of my brain were reimplanted , it 's been changing ... me ... back into the man I was before . Bit by bit . I 'm losing myself , Pete . I 'm losing the man that you helped me become . Listen to me . I 'm not gonna let that happen . We need you . You are our only hope to defeat the Observers . And I 'm gonna be here with you , every step of the way . Please , son , whatever happens , don 't let me go . I won 't , dad . I promise .

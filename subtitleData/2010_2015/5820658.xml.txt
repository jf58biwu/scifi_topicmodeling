Our world has always been full of nightmares , creatures and aliens who want to destroy us . You 're watching the BBC News and I 'm Louise Marlowe . Later , we 'll be looking at how the continuing rise in house prices has increased the number of families choosing to live in rented accommodation . But first , questions were asked in Parliament today . That 's nice . No . Go ahead . Switch me off . I 'm talking to you , Rani . Didn 't your mother ever tell you not to sit so close to the screen ? How are you doing that ? But I need more . I need so much more . Hello . Stop snoring . It 's the Nightmare Man and I can 't stop him . Mum , I 'm sorry . That 's why I tried so hard to stay awake . Please . Luke . Come on , Luke , wake up . It 's Mum , please ! Come on , please ! Wake up , please . Mr Smith , I need you ! Come on , please ! Wake up ! K9 , where are you ? Approaching , mistress ! My sensors indicate Master Luke is asleep , mistress . I know that , K9 . I 'm scanning the alien 's face , Luke 's Nightmare Man is a Vishclar from the Saretti dimension . That creature stopped Luke telling us about him but Luke 's clever . He didn 't record that video because he was scared but because he knew we 'd find it , and he knew we 'd save him ! You still serving burgers ? I always knew you were a stupid boy . We 've got to find a way to talk to him . Remember that sentient concrete disguised as the Chiswick flyover ? She was using this to control people . If we can ... What is it , Mistress ? Clyde , come on , please ! - What are you ? - Breaking news , Rani . I need you . What do you mean ? I shouldn 't be here ! I don 't know what I 'm doing . You are a journalist , aren 't you ? Go easy on the sauce . I don 't get it , where 's Luke ? He 's such a clever boy . He 's working for the Government now . Says he 's going to be an astronaut . I went to space once . - Yeah , with the Doctor . - I told you ? I get confused . The social reckon I 'm losing it . They want to put me in a home ! I 've got a home , thank you . What am I meant to say ? Her name is ... - Sarah Jane ? - You and me , Rani . We 're going to tell everyone who she is . We 're going to destroy Sarah Jane Smith . I can 't wake them up . The sentient concrete , we must wake Luke first . Correct , Mr Smith . Could you use this , K9 , to talk to Luke ? Affirmative . Working . Master Luke , can you hear me ? Master Luke ? I regret I have insufficient power . Perhaps I can help . If I were to connect to K9 , I could boost his energy levels . What do you need , Mr Smith ? I 've stuff from planets across the universe . Mind control devices , alien plants . Just tell me what you need . I need a USB lead , Sarah Jane . It isn 't real . This is just a stupid dream ! Nightmare Man ! Nightmare Man ! Can you hear me ? Your mind is so strong , Luke , echoing across the dimensions . Come back and face me ! What 's the matter ? Are you scared ? I 'm just happy . You 've taken my place . I 've taken yours . You 've made the monster real , Lukey . Come back ! Ready ? Maximum energy to K9 . Engaging . Approaching full energy transfer mode . I can 't stop him . I can 't . It 's just me . Negative , Master Luke . It is never just you . How did you get here ? - Did Mum send you ? - Affirmative . She wanted me to tell you that this is a dream and that you need to wake up . I know . I 've tried , but I can 't . - Mr Smith ? - The dog is communicating with Luke . I wish Clyde and Rani were here . They always know what to do . Master Clyde and Mistress Rani are asleep . Your mother cannot wake them . He 's got them ? On air in 60 seconds . - Why do you want to destroy Sarah Jane ? - Why do you think ? The woman 's a menace to society . What are you on about ? She saves the world ! At what cost ? You , Clyde , her own son . How many times has she put you at risk ? It 's not like that . How many times have you nearly died because of her ? - I don 't know . - You 're just a child , Rani . It 's not your fault . If we don 't expose her , she 'll get you killed . She has given me a better life . - She 's my friend . - Grow up ! If you 're going to be a journalist you 'll need to stop worrying about peoples ' feelings . Don 't you want to be a journalist ? Then there 's nothing wrong with us telling the world . The public have a right to know , Rani . And it 's your responsibility as a journalist to tell them . And on air in five , four ... I don 't want this . I was doing my art . I was good at it , wasn 't I ? You are sweet . Stupid , but sweet . I 'm not stupid . You were never as good as my Luke . That 's why you ended up here . - You 'd never say that . - What do you mean , dear ? This isn 't a burger bar . These aren 't real burgers , and you , you 're not the real Sarah Jane . There 's no way out . The nightmares ! So many nightmares for me to feast on ! I 'm Louise Marlowe . And I 'm ...

It 's just a nightmare . - Stay with me , Rani - I can 't wake up ! - I can 't stop it ! - Just read the news ! How do I get out of here ? - She needs a door , Master Luke . - That 's it ! Clyde , can you hear me ? - Thank God ! Where are you ? - I 'm going to get you out of there . Hold on . Both of you listen . I 'm in a corridor , and there 's loads of doors . I need you to concentrate . Imagine there 's a door . And I 'm on the other side of it . Where are you ? We 're in different nightmares , but we 're talking to each other ? Think of a classroom door ! Like the ones at school . You 've got to imagine it . Do you understand ? A red door , imagine a red door , come on ! You can do it , I know you can . Focus . Keep focusing on the door . Focus ! It 's working ! I 've done it ! Breaking news , Rani . Luke 's leaving you . He 's got his A-levels and he 's going to uni . - He 's leaving you behind . - I know ! Then why do you do what he tells you to ? Stay with me , Rani , be a journalist . I 'll give you everything { \ * you ever } wanted . Stay here . You made a door appear ! You could make money , gold , everything you 've ever wanted . Please ! I need you . Breaking news . I 'm out of here . Come on ! I quit . We did it ! What ? No , that isn 't possible ! They 're together ! Are we all having the same dream ? - That 's impossible . - That 's amazing ! I guess we 're just that good . But where are we ? Mr Smith told K9 about this different dimension . It 's where our minds go when we dream . Reminder , we need to defeat the Nightmare Man . The what ? Bad dog ! K9 ! No help for you , Sarah Jane Smith . You must be alone , with a little hint of moonlight on your face . Here , boy ! Something must have happened to the real K9 . - Mum . - She 'll be OK . She 's brilliant , your mum . You haven 't seen him . You don 't know what he 's like . Good to meet you at last . You know me ? I feed on every nightmare that every man , woman and child has ever had . And you have had so many . The things you have seen . Luke , your fear about what might happen to him . And the dreams about the Doctor , when he never came back and you thought he was dead . They were good ! I 'm not scared of you . What 's wrong ? Not used to someone arguing back ? What 's the matter ? If you 're so strong , send me to sleep . You want to have nightmares ? You 've already taken my son . My friends . This is already a nightmare ! What else have I got live for ? Come on , do it ! You think if I send you to sleep , you 'll be able to join Luke . And I almost fell for it . What do we do ? I don 't know . It 's OK , we 're here . Why am I wasting my time with you , old woman ? They 're still together . - I can feel them . - They 're still together , even in their dreams . And that 's what 's hurting you . To be scared , he needs to be alone . And he will be alone . Forever ! No , come back ! What the hell are you ? I am the Nightmare Man . And you two are going to suffer ! You 're just an alien . We can stop you . You 're nothing . You 're pathetic children , scared of the dark . Scared of me . Do something ! You 're going back into your nightmares . Get away from us !

And she found others . A boy called Clyde . And a girl called Rani . This world has faced so many nightmares but there 's always been someone there to stop them . Us ! I was so scared because I thought my mates wouldn 't be there for me . Never mind Oxford , they followed me into my nightmares ! Three kids breaking down the walls of dreams to be together . Something no-one 's ever done . Because together , we 're unbeatable ! Very good . But do you really think words can stop a creature like me ? I wasn 't talking to you . He 's right .

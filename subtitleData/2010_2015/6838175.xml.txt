Come on baby , come on . In one mile , turn right . Thank you . Oh yes , thank you . Hi , David. it 's me . I just wanted to thank you for being my friend . And for never giving up on me . You must have noticed by now that my car is not in the garage and ... You are probably wondering , where the hell I am . Well , you told me to leave the hole and so I did . I don 't know where exactly where I 'm heading But I just want you to know that I 'm alright . Oh , by the way ... Thanks for the gift . It means a lot to me .. Talk to you later . Take care , buddy . In half a mile , turn left . Thank you . In one mile , turn right . Turn right . You have arrived to your destination . You have arrived to your destination . You have arrived to your destination . C 'mon . What ? This is it ? Damn it . THE DAY BEFORE You know we have a strict no cell phone use in class policy . However your daughter doesn 't want to abide by that policy . Her conduct is disruptive . Therefore I recommend you take advantage of the suspension and have a serious talk withyour daughter . I 'm sorry , but ... This is a bit hard to believe . I mean , it doesn 't sound like Lucy at all . I just can 't think of what could make her behave like this . I 'm so mad . Sorry ... Your Hand ? Oh , thank you . Do you mind if I ask what happened ? UH , we had a gas leak at the apartment last week . And I was lighing one of those scented candles AND BOOM ! You know ? The air just went up around me all in flames But luckily . Lucy had just opened a window minutes before . I mean , I am lucky I only burned my hand . Well , and my hair , hence the silly scarf . Sorry to hear that . That must have been quite a scare . Do you think that may be why she 's been acting out ? I don 't think so . I mean , she didn 't get hurt or anything . But you could have been seriously hurt . A life threatening situation can change a person . Lucy and I had an argument over that window . With no apparent reason she decided to open it And ... I mean I was not happy about it . it was freezing outside and we were both sick . I kept asking her to close it but she just ignored me Who would have guessed that window would save both of our lives ? Ironic , huh ? Given the situation , here 's what I can do I won 't go on record with official suspension , I don 't think Lucy deserves that kind of damage on her school record anyway . However , I want you to promise me That you 'll take the next week to work out this phone issue with her . So it does not escalate to something more serious . Sound fair ? Yes . I appreciate it . And I promise she 'll be back like new . Lucy . Lucy , are you home ? Lucy , didn 't I tell you to get new curtains ? Lucy . Lucy ! Mom , what are you doing here ? What does it look like ? I 'm looking for you . Please , mom , not now . I want to know who gave you a cellphone . No one . So how are you paying for it ? I 'm not . So who is ? No One . Wow ! a Free phone that makes free calls ! Amazing ! Did you steal it ? Of course not ! So what 's the story ? C 'mon spill it . My boyfriend gave it to me . Since when do you have a boyfriend ? - Since last week . Really ? Yeah . You know what ? I wish you had a boyfriend . Maybe then you could learn something about life on planet earth for a change . The problem is you can 't get a boyfriend Even though you 're wearing a shirt saying " I love dick " For your information , Philip K. Dick is the world 's greatest science fiction writer . God , you 're so ignorant . All I want to know is how you got ahold of a cell phone I found it ok ? I found it ! Why are you making calls from it if it 's not yours ? It 's complicated . Ok ? And I don 't want to talk about it . Well , it can 't be more complicated than you 're life 's gonna be if you don 't tell me every single detail of that story Where do you think you 're going ? I do not talk on the phone in class if that 's what the principal told you . Well , he says you do . Otherwise he wouldn 't bother me with it . Well , I don 't I mean ... How could I ? The phone doesn 't even work . Say it again ? The phone is broken . It doesn 't work . It never did . If it doesn 't work , why do you have it ? I mean , that is even more puzzeling to me . Do you just pretend to talk on the phone in class to look cool or to piss off the teachers ? Is that the deal ? No . So what do you do with it ? The principal was very clear about you being seen using the phone in class . Are you saying they made that up ? I just listen to it . You listen to what ? The phone You listen to the phone ? Yes . Didn 't you just say the phone is broken ? Yes , I did , But sometimes , I get it out of the bag and put it to my ear . What for ? I hear things . Oh , God . What things ? Words . Words ? You mean it plays the radio ? No , it 's not that . It doesn 't work at all . I told you . So how do you hear words ? Actually , it 's just a single word each day . I don 't get it . I just ... I hear one word . That 's it . Every day I hear one . Lucy , you 're not making any sense . I knew you wouldn 't understand . That 's why I didn 't tell you . Okay ! You found a cellphone which is dead Caput ! No signal . And you hear words coming from it . Yes And these words , what are they ? Clues . Clues about what ? Promise you won 't freak out ? Lucy , you 're scaring me . You have to promise . Ok , I promise . Each word is a clue about what can save me every day . That 's not funny . You 're joking , right ? Does it sound like I 'm joking ? This is serious but I don 't want you to get all freaked out about it either C 'mon , Lucy . How am I supposed to react to that ? Just listen to the rest of what I have to say and be cool , alright ? I 'm listening . Remembered the fire ? How can I forget ? That was when it started . What do you mean ? I found the phone on the street that morning and I realized it wasn 't working . So I kept trying to figure out why it wasn 't working because it looked new . I turned it on and off and then I put it to my ear to check for sound And then this word sounded over and over What word ? Window I kept hearing the word ' window ' . and then I got home and saw myself running toward the kitchen window and not really sure what to do And I just opened it . And then , you know what happened . You mean you opened the window that saved our lives because that cellphone told you to ? I know . I know what you 're thinking . It 's crazy . I want you to stop this nonesense . No ! You need to hear this ! Yesterday , the word was ' ticket ' . So ? Did you see the news ? There was a gang shooting at the Grey Souls ' concert . Two kids got killed . I was supposed to go but I didn 't . Do you know why ? No , why ? I lost my ticket . Thank God you lost that ticket , but ... How am I supposed to believe that you 're hearing these words , or clues , or whatever ? Mom , you know that I 've never been into superstitious , Hocus pocus bullshit . I 've Always been very rational . So please , I am begging you to believe me . Just tell me one more thing . What ? What 's today 's word ? Did it save your life already ? I know today 's word . But nothing 's happened yet . So what 's the word ? Why should I tell you ? You don 't believe me anyway . How am I supposed to believe you if you don 't tell me what the word is ? I have an idea . I 'm gonna write down the word . This way , you won 't know it until it happens . This way you won 't be obssessing about it . Me ? Obsess ? I have a better idea . What is it ? Can I see the phone ? What for ? I just want to hold it for a second . What is the idea ? I 'll show you . What are you doing ? I 'm sorry to do this , but I have to put an end to this charade right now . If you need guidance , you come to me , and listen to what I say . Not some ridiculous broken phone Lucy ! No ! God ! Hold on ! Do not let go of me , please , don 't let go ! Hold on to my hand ! I 'm holding you as strong as I can I 've got you . Don 't let go , don 't let go . Hold on tight , hold on tight , ok ? Baby hold on tight . Just hold on . I 'm ok ! Oh my god ! I 'm slipping , I 'm slipping . I 'm gonna fall off ! Look at me . I 'm not going to let you die ! Don 't let go ! That phone was meant to kill you . Not save you . Think again . Hand Mom , are you sure about this ? I mean , I don 't think leaving town all of a sudden is gonna make any difference . I promised the principal that we would go away for a week . Just the two of us and that 's exactly the way it 's going to be Well , It 's always been the two of us , no matter where we go . I need to figure out what 's going on with you and that phone and I can 't think at the house . And if you 're tired of it being just the two of us , why don 't you bring your imaginary boyfriend along ? Maybe I can 't get a boyfriend because you can 't get a boyfriend . I have a theory that it 's genetic . Ha , ha ! Where are we going exactly ? I 'm not sure . As long as it 's not Mexico . For God 's sake , Lucy , we are not running from the police . Do you think that only criminals want to go to mexico ? Shhh ... Please , I 'm thinking . Look , it 's easy ... We can 't go West because we 're already as far west as we can possibly go We can 't go south because are not outlaws . And we can 't go North because we can 't get a man in LA . Chances are we 'll die single in San Francisco , so ... I guess there 's only one option left . Which is ? Vegas . Ha ! You wish ! So , tell me something . How often do you hear those words ? Every day . I told you . And it 's just one word each day ? Yes So if each word lasts 24 hours , after midnight you should hear a new one . Yeah , I guess so . Can 't wait . Have you figured out where we 're going yet ? No.Not yet . I didn 't know that you also liked to travel into the unknown . What are you doing ? I am going to do my own travelling What book is it ? " The Time Machine " by H. G. Wells . Didn 't they make a movie about it ? Several . So why do you want to still read the book ? Uh , actually I 'm reading it now for the third time . Are you insane ? why ? Because I 'm doing a thesis on Time Travelling My god , Lucy , if it 's time travel you 're into Why don 't you just watch the " Back to the Future " trilogy ? Instead of reading the same book three times ? Well , actually I only read the book once . But because I managed to go back in time twice , to the exact moment before I read the book , I don 't remember So technically although I read the book twice already , I 'm reading it now for the first time . What ? Ok , You need to relax . I 'm just teasing you . How many rooms ? Just one . With two beds , please . Thirty dollars . Thank you . You 're welcome . Finally I can get some sleep No , you can 't . Do you think I can go to sleep without knowing what 's the next word that 's gonna save my daughter ? I told you I only get one word per day . I know , it IS the next day . It 's passed midnight . In case you haven 't noticed . Are you for real ? You bet I am . So you better grab that cell phone and start listening , 'cause I 'm not going to sleep and neither are you . Until we hear God 's word . Look , it doesn 't happen like that . I just can 't force the phone to give the word whenever I want . It happens when it has to happen , not because I want it to . Will you just try it for a bit ? Mom , I 'm tired . Just try it , for God 's sake . You know , I have been doing this alone and am not sure if it 's going to work with you staring at me like that . Do you want me to close my eyes ? I think I can hear something . What ? What do you hear ? I hear ... " Sleep " Don 't be smart . Just concentrate , will you ? I hear nothing . Can we do this tomorrow , please ? All right , all right. have it your way . Wait ! What is it ? I 'm getting it . Well , say i ! King What ? It 's " King " . The word is King . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means what it means . King is the clue . King of what ? I do not know . But it 's gonna save my life somehow . I guarantee it . But what king ? Well , maybe it 's King Kong . He seems to be keen on girls . This is not funny . Look , can we go to bed now ? Nothing 's gonna happen tonight anyway . So we might as well just deal with it in the morning Wait ! What ? You can 't sleep in this bed . Why not ? It 's not safe . What ? Just ... just get out of bed and come with me . Are you kidding me ? Mom , are you insane ? Hello ! What are you doing ? Excuse me ! Hi , uh , we need a king size bed , please . I don 't think there 's one available tonight . Well , could you just check Please , it 's very important . Well , there is one , but I don 't think it 's in good condition . It 'll be fine . The toilet is clogged . - We don 't mind . Thank you Enjoy . If " King " is going to save you , then you 'll be sleeping on one . Okay . Here it is . We can 't take any chances . King Kong was here , and he left evidence . If you need to pee , just use the bathtub . Whatever ! Rise and shine , my Queen . C 'mon we gotta get you your King . What time is it ? How do I look ? You remind me of my mother . I 'll take that as a compliment . You know , some people think you still have a pretty hot mommy . I heard what the kids of the neighborhood call you . Milf . Milf ? What the hell is that ? Mother I 'd Like To f ... Fantasize ... Oh , my God , Lucy . That 's disgusting . Mom , you 're too uptight . You know you 're never gonna find a man that way . And you really need one ... badly . You better work on that laughter , because you make the sound dogs make just before they throw up . Where are we going to find breakfast ? Burger King . Where else ? Here . It 's all I could find . There is no Burger King in a thirty mile radius . I still think we should get one , though . Just in case . And how do you figure a Whopper is gonna save me today ? Kings aren 't to be questioned . I bought this for you . " The shining " by Stephen King ? Really ? Yeah ! Hold on to it . At least until midnight . And I thought that I was going crazy . You know that Stephen King writes mostly horror stories . Which usually end badly for the main character Most of his stories are pretty creepy like this one for instance . It 's a bloodbath from start to finish . Hey , I remember from the movie And I 'm tense enough already . Change the subject . You know , you never gave me a book before . Of course I have . Nope , this is the first one . I gave you a diary once . It 's not exactly a book . It is once you write in it . I gotta go to the bathroom . Just make sure you take Stephen with you . People might think that I 'm going to use it for something else . Take it Don 't use all the pages . Save some for me . Hey shithead ! Where 's my $ 20 you owe me ? I said I 'd get it . You said the same yesterday . And I want it now . Yeah , well , I don 't have it here . I can get it tomorrow . You have until midnight oryou 'll never See your Fisher Price limited edition chess board again ! It 's Bobby Fisher , you idiot . Hey ! Where do you think you 're going with my daughter 's bag ? Let go of me , crazy bitch . You 're not going anywhere Get your hands off me . Let go , you little bastard Get your hands off me ! Give me the bag ! Give it to me ! Bitch ! Let go of the bag ! Let go of it ! Give it to me ! You want a piece of this ? Mother ! You are so dead , bitch ! No ! Get out of here ! Run to the car , Lucy . Run , Lucy . Throwing a book at guy who 's holding a gun ? What were you thinking ? He was going to shoot you . What I supposed to do ? Don 't put yourself in danger because of me ! I can handle myself ! So much for Stephen King . That phone was meant to kill you not save you . What 's that ? My savior . I 'll be damned . This isn 't my stuff . What ? This is definately not my bag . Where did you get this ? I thought it was yours . That guy had it . Well , I put my stuff under the bench . Did you check ? I didn 't see anything . I thought that guy took it . Well , obviously not . Shoot ! We have to go back . Are you crazy ? We 're not going back there . I have all my stuff in there . Forget it . I 'll buy you new books ! My thesis notes ! That 's months of work . I 'll tell you what . If you can go back in time and get it , be my guest We 're not going back ! I 'm sorry honey What am I supposed to do with all this stuff ? Do not touch anything . Just ... we don 't want our fingerprints on it . Throw it out the window . Go ! Alright , here 's the deal . Tonight we sleep on my rules . I get my own bed and I 'm not telling you the word before the morning . Ok , well , just one more thing . What ? The day is not over yet . So you better hold on to your savior . Ok ? Here take the wheel for a second ? There . Keep it on . I 'm doomed . You just hung the King Do you think if I listened to the phone , I would hear words ? I don 't know . Why don 't you try it ? What does the voice sound like ? What voice ? The voice you hear . Is it a man 's voice or a woman 's ? Who says I hear voices ? Well , how do you hear the word ? It just sort of pops in my head . I don 't know . Ok , that 's freaky . Damn it . What 's wrong ? My head hurts . What ? Is it serious ? Yes , it hurts Well , we 'll go to the drugstore and get you some Advil . Stupid Cellphone . It 's probably the radiation . It 's cooking your brain cells and turning you into a mutant . Mom ... Something is just happening . What is it ? There 's a new word . What ? I just heard a new word . Well , how can that be ? I mean , I 'm the one holding the cell phone . You 're not even holding it . I know . I don 't know . Isn 't it just a word per day ? Listen , I don 't make the rules . I 'm just as confused and surprised as you are ! But the fact is I just got a new word buzzing in my head . For Christ 's sake , Lucy . When is this ever going to end ? I mean , you 're joking , right ? Tell me you 're joking No , I 'm not . So what the hell is the new word ? Air Yeah Like the wind ? Yeah . Well , here . Have plenty of it ! How 's your headache now ? What are you doing ? Leave the window open . I 'm getting cold . Can we close the others , too ? I don 't think that 's wise . You know , I think it 's probably better if I never tell you any more words again . Why ? Because you are probably gonna make me sleep in an air bed tonight . You know , you started by saying that all this was happening because I was obssessed about it . But you 've been acting a lot worse . Didn 't you learn anything from the " King " ? If the " air " is going to save me , it might as well be in a way that we least expect . So do not try to help because you 're making it a lot worse . You know , just stop the car . I 'll put the windows up . Stop the car . You don 't have to get so upset ! Stop the car ! What for ? Just stop it or I 'm gonna throw up in your lap . Lucy ! Come on , Lucy . Lucy , Come back here ! You have arrived to your destination . You have arrived to your destination . Damn it . Oh , my God . Lucy ! THE DAY BEFORE Claire . Claire . Well , hello , Claire . Did you find the place alright ? Yeah ! What 's going on , sis ? I haven 't heard from you in over two and a half years And all of a sudden you leave me this message to drive a million miles out to this god forsaken place . Is this a mental health test ? Well . Matt , it may surprise you But I need your help with one of my patients . One of your patients needs my help ? I 'm very serious . I think you may hope that he 's the safest patient . Well , you 're the shrink , not me . Will you just listen to what I have to say ? I 'm listening . I have been taking care of a special patient . His name is Daniel Doyle . Age 17 . He 's an intern in a mental health center for a year now You still work at tha nut house ? Yep . Just got promoted last week at Vice President of the board . Wow ! Congrats V.P. ! it just lasted a day though ... What happened ? Differences of opinions you know ? This kid Daniel , for instance , they wanted to release him again . Well , in my opinion ... What is your opnion ? I believe ... he 's going to seriously hurt himself as soon as he gets out . What do you mean by seriously hurt himself ? Suicide . Right ... How do I fit in the picture ? Daniel 's girlfriend died and he 's not been able to deal with it . I think he 's going to need to connect with someone he believes can really understand his pain Someone he can look in the eye and respect . And you think that 's me ? Yeah , I do . Will you talk to him. please ? Well , Claire , my girlfriend didn 't die . I know . But you almost did . He 's such a good kid . He reminds me of you . Really ? Well can you tell me why you made me come all the way outhere ? We will get into that later .. Now , just listen to me carefully . Ok , go on ! About a year ago , during Spring Break This kid Daniel and his girlfriend Jennifer were camping at Lake Mirage . She went for a swim while Daniel was taking pictures with a digital camera . They were both having fun , when Jennifer had a seizure and started drowning She went down really fast . Daniel , howeve , was quick to react He jumped into the water , dived down , grabbed her carried her to shore and performed CPR But unfortunately she didn 't survive . Now here 's Daniel 's thought on it . According to his statement , he claimed he couldn 't cope with losing her , so he decided to end his life as well . A week after her funeral he jumped into the lake and ... guess what ? Well , he didn 't die . I can figure that much . Exactly . But the actual ordinary thing is that he claims that he actually drowned ... and woke up again on the lake just as he was trying to save his girlfriend . I think you kind of lost me there . What I mean is , he jumped into the lake , drowned and woke up trying to save Jennifer . Isn 't jennifer dead at this point ? She is . But not if you travel back in time . So , so ... Let me get this straight . While he 's drowning , he travels back in time and wakes up at the exact moment of the lake incident . Exactly . As she 's drowning . Ok ! What happens next ? And then he tries to save her but never succeeds . So we try to go back again . And again . Until he hopes one day he WILL succeed . So he 's like in a time loop ? Yes . But there is another interesting detail . Really ? What 's that ? Climb on top of the first cargo airplane , and call me when you get there . Ok ... . Go to the back of the airplane . Look for a small hatch behind the right wing Can you see it ? Yeah , I see it . Open it up and tell me what you find . It 's a digital camera . With a key on it . You see that camera ? - Yep Daniel claims he can only go back in time if he takes his camera with him . That same camera . How does that work ? He takes his own picture with that camera just before he dies . And that 's what makes time travel possible . The kid has a pretty wild imagination . Tell me about it . How he end up at your care at the center ? He was caught trying to drown himself . Someone saw it and stopped him . The incident was reported to his parents and he was brought to the center . Consequently the board agreed he should be interned . The same boaed that now thinks he 's fine ? Bingo . Well , there 's still one thing that I still don 't understand , Claire - What is it ? Did you have me come all the way out here just to pick up the kid 's camera ? Or is there something else going on ? Because you 're starting to freak me out . Are you going to tell me what 's REALLY going on here ? I 'm in trouble , Matt . You don 't say ! Let me guess . Your opinion was THAT strong . I guess . It runs in the family . Well , spill it , Claire . What exactly did you do ? Before Daniel was released from the center , I took him out there . Please don 't tell me you kidnapped the kid . I care about him , Matt . I had to do something . Well , where is he ? See that cargo airplane behind ? Yeah . He is in there . The kid is in the aircraft ? Where the hell are YOU ? I was hiding with him there . But the cops got him there , now I 'm home arrested . Are you out of your mind ? What was I supposed to do ? The moment he wants , he 'll go to the first body of water and die . Do you know what you 've done ? Not only are you going to lose your license , but they 're gonna put you away forever . it doesn 't matter , as long as it saves his life . Please , Matt . He has no one else . Claire ... I uh ... I can 't be involved in this . I got enough problems of my own . I just want you to talk to him , that 's all . I 'm sorry , Claire . But I can 't . Not too long ago , you were in this kid 's shoes . Did you forget that already ? I nearly lost my brother . Right under my nose . Because I was too busy dealing with my own problems . The sign were all around me . But I just decided to ignore them . And I do regret that very much . So if there 's anything I can do to help someone else who 's going through that same kind of emotional pain that makes you wish you could end it all , ... I will . How long have you kept the camera from the kid ? Since day One . When it was brought into the center . Well , allright . If the kid thinks this camera is a time machine , I think I want to know how it works . You in here , Daniel ? Daniel ? Is that you , Daniel ? Daniel ? Who are you ? I 'm matt . Claire 's brother . Welcome aboard to Flight Nowhere , Matt . Never really enjoyed flying myself . I like to keep my feet to the ground . if you know what I mean . Don 't tell me . You 're a shrink , too . No ... No ... Definately not . I 'm not a doctor of any kind . Still , Claire believes that I can help you God knows why . I helped a dog once . But I 'm not a vet either . As a matter of fact , I 'm unempleyed at the moment . Basically , I 'm just a sucker . A lot like you , no offense . You do know she 's just trying to help you , right ? It 's not working . Yeah , I can see that . heck ... . I don 't blame you at ever being so mad at the world ... It 's a tough thing to lose your girlfriend like that I know how that can mess with your head . Really ? Did your girlfriend die , too ? No . I hope not . What do you mean ? She disappeared . Well , like kidnapped , or something ? She just left . And I thought I was the biggest sucker . Yeah , you 're pronanly right about that . I do not blame her , though . I was just a stupid kid . So , what happened ? Well , I was 16 . And a rich kid Born and raised in a wealthy family in Chicago . My parents had big plans for me . I was a bit of ... a prodigy in college so I was about to ... Go into med School So far , so good , right ? And then fate decided to change things up on me . Guess what ? Fell in love . The only problem with that was that ... uh .. She was 20 years old and a cabby . I should have been smarter than to try ... to force my parents , to accept the fact that I wanted to marry this ... Twenty year-old , immigrant , taxi driver . With diamond-shaped tattoo on her face . Boy , oh boy did they , uh ... Go on a crusade against us . It was pure lunacy . And even then I still tought we could win . So , we decided that we 'd pretendit was over Until I was legal . For two years That was hard . But we had a secret signal . Whenever we crossed each other 's paths we would touch our noses . It 's an ancient ... um ... signal Arctic tribes used Whenever the men were gonna go a long hunt across the icy desert , The wives would touch their noses like this . It means in death My heart will follow you to the ends of the earth . We thought that was an appropriate signal . Because the environment surrounding us was Cold as an Arctic winter night . Sad thing is we didn 't survive it . You see , my parents are hard to fool . They , uh ... Found out she didn 't have a green Card and had her blackmailed for deportation . Hey , crazy teenage drama , right ? So , what happened to her ? Never saw her again . What did you do ? Tried to go ... back in time . Like you . How ? Needless to say I didn 't succeed . Looks like you 're stuck . Life is so much like a dark comedy . When all this happened , all I wanted to do was end my life , and ... Here I am carrying an epi pen on my wallet everywhere I go . An epipen ? Auto injector of Epinephrine . I 'm allergic to bees , and without epipen , one sting could mean the end of me Pretty pathetic , huh ? So tell me , what changed in your life since then ? What made you trade your razor blades in for an epipen ? Hope . Like you , I hope that I can find a way to travel back in time and be with my girl again . I just don 't think killing myself is the answer . Unless of course you and your camera can prove me wrong . What kind of proof do you need ? You could bring me some photos . You know what they say , " A picture is worth a thousand words " . If you give me my camera back , and help me get out of here , I 'll get you the pictures that you need . I 'll see what I can do . Thanks for staying overnight . How could I turn down free lodging at such a thematic campsite ? What are you thinking ? I think those handcuffs are gonna look pretty bad on your resume . I 'm sorry but desperate situations call for desperate measures . We can 't let him go before we 're sure he 's gonna be alright . He 's never gonna be alright if we don 't let him go , Claire . You know , mom and dad miss you so much . You should try to forgive them . Maybe . It 's a damn shame you had to fall for that wrong girl . She wasn 't the wrong girl . Sorry , you know I didn 't mean it . God , it 's been like ten years . Did you ever get any news from her ? No . I can 't believe you 're still in love . You are , aren 't you ? I think it 's a little late for a therapy session . You know what ? In part , I really envy you . I think we both need to get some sleep . I 'll try my best ! Good night - Night Are you heading west , by any chance ? Jump in Young Dude . All right . Thanks . Please tell me you didn 't let him go ? Look , you said you wanted Daniel to talk to someone he could look in the eye and respect . Someone he knew could understand what he was going through , right ? Yeah , I guess said that . Well , the only way for Daniel to really believe that I understand what he 's going through ... was to set him free . He 's not much ready yet . And we know that Daniel tried to kill himself before . And ... When you think of doing something that terrible to yourself ... You feel so lonely it 's unbearable . I know , because I did . I felt so miserable and lonely ... that I didn 't think anyone could endure that kind of pain and still go on living . Daniel may still be out ther , and he is still be thinking about killing himself . But he knows there is someone else out there ... who endured his pain and stll walks mlong he living . He knows he 's not alone . And he knows that person 's right here perfectly happy to give him a helping hand . I hope you 're right , Matt . I really hope you 're right . If it makes you feel any better , I think I know exactly where he 's headed . Where ? Well , he tried to drown himself at Lake Mirage to wake up and save his girlfriend at Lake Mirage . So I think that is where he 's headed and that is about 3 hours from here . He 's going to die , Matt , I know it . No . Don 't worry . Let me handle this . Ok ? I 'll find him and I 'll make sure he 's alright . So , my sister , she 's 65 . She comes home one day ... and she hears this strange sound , coming from the bedroom So she goes in ... and she finds her 40 year old daughter , that 's my niece ... Playing with a vibrator . You know what a vibrator is , right ? Yeah , I know . Internet . Ah , got you . So she says : 'What are you doing ? ' And her daughter says : Mom , I 'm 40 years old . ... Look at me . I ' m ugly ... I 'm never gonna get married . This is as close to a husband as I 'm gonna get . Eww , sad . Yeah . Sad . Next day ... My brother-in-law comes home ... And hears thame same buzzing sound coming out of his daughter 's room ... He goes in and there she is .. ... using the vibrator . Yeah . He says : What the hell is going on here ? And she she says Dad , I just told Mom ... I 'm 40 years old , I 'm ugly and I 'm never gonna get married . This is pretty much my husband . So he ... you know , walks out of the room kind of sad like ... Next day , my sister comes home ... And she finds him on the couch beer in one hand ... vibrator in the other hand ... And Watching football on Television . She says : What in Heaven 's name is going on ? He says : What does it I ook like is going on ? I 'm drinking a beer watching the football game with my son-in-law . Son-in-law ! So , where did you say you 're from ? I didn 't , actually . Where ARE you from ? I was born in Iceland , raised in California , I think such a sudden , extreme change in climate must have screwed my brain cells somehow . because I ended up in a nuthouse . Really ? Wow ! When was that ? Very , very recently . Don 't worry , I 'm harmless . You look fine to me . You know ... I have had my time with psychiatrists , too . How 's that ? I got this ... uh ... seizure that used to knock me out all the time ... Every time I tried to ... you know ? ... Come together with my woman . - laughs- I couldn 't perform because I 'd pass out before I ever got started . How ' bout that , huh ? So ... The doctors thought it 's probably mental and they sent me off to a mental institution . That 's where they ... you know , tried all kinds of freaky tests on me . Finally , it comes out I 'm just allergic to latex . You know , can 't wear rubber ... You mean condoms ? All rubber . And especially condoms . The initial , uh , diagnosis I guess was right . I have a problem with my head . - laughter- That 's kind of freaky . Nah . Not so bad , though . At least I won The best parking in town . Sweet ! You know ... You must have had a lot of things happen to you in that nuthouse . Uh ... Like every good drama , has it 's comedy moments . I guess . Well , let 's hear them . Well this one time , we had a visit from a wealthy benefactor of the mental institution . She was really a classy and really conservative. lady . And uh , on their tour of one of the floors she passed a room where this patient was masturbating . She was in complete awe , like - If it is discovered . How is it justified ? And The doctor explained like , I 'm really sorry , ma 'am , but ... he has a serious condition where if he doesn 't do it several times a day he 's afraid , that his testicles are going to swell up and explode . And he 'll die . You know that can actually happen . So the lady. was like Oh , that 's terrible ... And they continued on with the tour . And In the very next room , she sees nurse Chavez , the hottest nuese you can imagine . Going down another male patient . And the lady was so shocked Like : How is this justified ? What is going on in this hospital ? I don 't understand . And the doctor was so embarrassed he didn 't know what to do. so he ... So he puts on a straight face Turn to her looking in the eye and tells her : Same condition , better health plan . - laughs- Better health plan ! - laughs- Different health plan ! There you go , son . Alright ! Thanks a lot ! Good luck . Three dollars . Thanks . Hey Mister ! Will you blow this up for me , please Where are your parents ? My mommy is inside buying candy .

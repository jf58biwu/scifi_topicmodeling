 Someone just hit the tripwires . - Toth ? - He just took out two more . He 's not gonna make it . I got his wireless . Why ? Why do you think ? Fun and games are over . I 'm sending the evac code , and we 're outta here . - Are you nuts ? - No . We complete this mission then you can send whatever code you want , all right ? Look , kid , unless you haven 't notice we 're fresh out of marines and ammo . I 'm not trained for this . So we 're gonna have to make do . All right ? Where are we going ? It 's an automated transmission array . Put your gun down , Husker . Put it down . What are you doing ? You guys want to die heroes right now ? I can do that for you , right now ! Test me , Husker ! What are you doing ? - Why are you doing this ? - I can 't take it . Please , put the gun down . All right , it 's gone . - You tell me why we 're here right now . - Don 't do this . Tell me why we 're here ! This war isn 't going nearly as well as the government claim . I know . This surprise attack is a last roll of the dice . It fails , we fail . And it will fail , if you don 't get me where I need to go . She 's talking sense . Coker , please . So now we need to know . You tell me why we 're here . It 's an automated Cylon transmission array . Once we gain access , I will upload a virus . Can you please take the gun of my chest ? Please ? Keep talking . I will upload a virus that is designed to blind their defenses . A virus that I 've been carrying in this . And you didn 't trust me enough to tell me this before ? No . I 'm sorry . I trust you now . Good . Now we communicate . Tell us the rest . Make sure there 's no more surprises . It 's an automated Cylon transmission array about 6 klicks from here . So , if we leave now , we 'll make it before nightfall . The facility is automated . So we shouldn 't run into too many century and guards . That is if we 're careful not to trip the internal defense system . The central corridor leads directly to the control room . We only nee to access one of their com channel to upload the virus . A virus that is designed to spread through their entire network and lie dormant until we trigger it disabling all their communication in advance of an attack . Clear ! What is it ? I thought I saw something . I guess I 'm just jumpy . We are in . Hurry with that thing , all right ? Come on ! It 's a large program , it 'll take ... Stop ! Put it down ! Put the gun now , Husker , or I 'll shoot you . She is working for them . - What ? - She 's a Cylon spy ! No ! Howdo I stop this ? How could she be a spy ? Ask her about the hotel ! About the Cylon that stopped and scanned her ! What ? - Don 't know what you 're saying . - What ? ! The toaster had you dead to rights ! Then it saw this thing and froze . Can you explain that to me ? Can you ? I have no idea what are you talking about . Coker , put the gun down . On the floor and calm down , okay ? - Drop the gun . - Oh , frak ! It 's not a virus , it 's a recording device . Oh , frak ! You 're giving them all the info on the ghost ship , aren 't you ? You frakking bitch ! That 's why they destroyed the Archeron . So that Colonial intel ... Coker ! Stop ! I will shoot you if I have to . No , no ! I though you wanted to end this war . It will end when we 'll realize that we can 't win . That we have to negotiate . Negotiate ? For the last 10 years , they 've been trying to wipe us out ! They 're just defending themselves . No . They value life for more than we do . - You saw what was in that freezer . - Stop ! Was that them defending themselves ? Was that them valuing life ? They 're robots ! Beka , okay ? It 's all they are . It 's all ... Are you okay , buddy ? - Coker , you okay ? - Stop the upload ! It 's all inside and I can 't make it out . Well , then go to ... plan B , kid . Come on , come on ! It stopped but I don 't know how much as already been sent . Get yourself outta here ! I 'm gonna start listening to you now ? Come on ! Okay , this is far enough . Put me down . I said put me down . Shouldn 't be long now . Hold onto that for me ? Who 's this ? Katie . My wife . Why didn 't you tell me ? Sometimes you ... you miss something too much . You wouldn 't understand , kid . You have a lousy taste in women . but you 're all right , Are you alive ? Do you think because you 're more enlightened than the rest of your species , we hate you any less ? There 's our young hero . At ease , son . How you feeling today ? - Ready to get out of here , sir . - That 's the spirit , In the meantime , wanted you to review your after-action report . Command made a few changes they need you to sign off on . Guess they felt you we 're little hard on yourself . It says our mission was a complete success . - That 's just a lie . - Was it ? You knew . You wanted her to upload that data . - When the cylons attacked , the fleet ... - Was long gone . We hit every toaster base in five sectors . inflicted some major damage . For a while anyway they 're gonna be on the defensive . And what about the Osiris ? What about all those people who died ? You mean all those people who gave theyre lives ? You disapprove ? You feel used ? There 's a bit more at stake here than your personal sense of integrity . The people supports this war with their money , and they 'll stop if we stop giving them hope . So let them have their heroes and their unblemish victories , while we fight the real war . Good . We 're assembling a joint task force . Our best pilots , marines and infantry units for special ops throughout the war theater . In case you want to volunteer , There 's a shiny new Viper with your name on it waiting for you in the hangar bay . Well , maybe not with your name on it just yet . I hear you still have to pick a call sign . You think about it . What ? No cocky comebacks ? You look like crap . You want to talk ? You 're going home ? I 've got about six weeks left in my tour , so guess I 'll stick around that long . long as I don 't have to fly with you . Dear dad , Got your last letter . You 're right about preconceptions being dangerous , and not just in court . This war is turning out to be different than I expected . But maybe my mistake was to have expectations . It 's something you have to live inside of to understand , and while a part of me already hates it , another part knows that I will make soldiering my life . But this is the life I 've chosen . This crew , it 's my family now too . So I 'll tell you something else ... When this war over , and some day it will be what I 'll remember most aren 't the battles but the men and women who fought them with me . And I will miss them .

 ( CONGREGATION SINGING HYMN ) ( SCRAPING ) ( GROANING ) Don 't be afraid . I 'm not . ( SINGING CONTINUES ) Remember , we 'll be together in love forever . Jonas ? ( SINGING CONTINUES ) Jonas ! Stay with us ! Jonas ! ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me ( ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ) Let 's put them in the break room . So , exactly how much stuff are you giving away ? Not enough . Whatever you guys don 't want , we 'll send to the homeless shelter . And this is part of your therapy ? Rosen 's idea . I 've accumulated a lot of things throughout the years . Hmm . Pushing people . Rosen thinks surrounding myself with ill-gotten gains keeps me hooked into my old lifestyle . And my old patterns . Does anyone have dibs on the Blu-ray ? ( CHUCKLES ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Yeah , Patti , what 's up ? ( SIGHS ) Yeah , okay , just one second . ROSEN : A seminar on police tactics ? All my buddies at the ATF take it . What 's this " hostage rescue , " and " breach and clear ? " What the hell is " breach and clear ? " Well , that 's my point . I 've told you a million times , we have to be prepared . Yeah , first badges . Hmm ? And now this mandate ? Just read the thing , Iet me know what you think . Slots are filling fast . I need to book this . Wait , wait , Bill . " Multiple threat assessment ? " I mean , look at this . Jacketed versus hollow point . Seriously ? Can you imagine me firing an AK-47 , much less Gary ? Gary 's a special case , okay ? But you ... I 've never fired a gun in my life . And that 's a conscious choice . Well , it 's time for you to make some new choices . Looking for anything in particular ? Yeah , a going-away present for my kid . Tyler 's leaving ? Patti wants a fresh start , so she 's , uh , she 's moving back to Nevada . And she 's taking Tyler with her . Uh , I 'm sorry to hear that , Cameron . That ... that 's terrible . Yeah , well , when you go into a custody hearing with a couple of DUIs , you don 't normally win . You 're not thinking of giving your son that , are you ? ( SIGHS ) You know , I , uh ... I haven 't really been to too many meetings lately . I think that 's an excellent idea . All right , and good to go . ( GASPS ) Uh , Gary , you 're supposed to take your shoes off . Oh , no , I like it this way . It 's all buzzy . Do you have one where I can lie down ? No . Get one . Give it to me . Hey , do you guys know where Hicks is ? Yeah , he just left . No . No , no . I ... I had it all planned out . I was going to take Omar from the gym , but then him and his boyfriend decided to go on a cruise last minute , and Hicks was my backup plan . And now , I don 't know what to do . You should get a foot massager . It 's very therapeutic . This one has 15 settings and a shiatsu mode . ( LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ) I don 't want a foot massager , Gary . I could help if I knew what you were talking about . My sister , she 's having her engagement party , and if I show up without a date , my mother is gonna auction me off . ( CHUCKLES ) Okay , well , take Harken . Isn 't he a little old ? Plus , he 's married . That 's just weird . So , Rosen 's out ? Isn 't there someone you can push ? I mean , the Express Mail guy 's gonna be here in 15 minutes . Look , Nina , if I don 't find a date , I 'm going to spend the rest of the year going on blind dates with third cousins . GARY : My feet are so happy . ( CHUCKLES ) Ah . That 's just desperate . Desperate times ... GIL : Thanks , Margaret . That was real . Anyone else like to share ? Cameron ? Cameron ? JONAS : If I may . ( EXHALES ) I 'd like to say something . Yeah , go for it . ( CLEARS THROAT ) My name is Jonas , I am not an alcoholic . Whoa , we said at the start , no sharing unless you 're one of us . I may not have experienced your pain personally , but I can help you . WOMAN : What ? How many people here are happy ? Truly happy ? Look , Gil asked you nicely . Are you happy ? You don 't look it . That 's it . It 's time to go . I have my answer , and I have your answer . GIL : Hey , guys , c 'mon . ( CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) ( INDISTINCT CHATTING ) Yes , you 're right . Yeah , it 's pretty . There 's really good food . There 's gifts . ( LAUGHS ) Yeah . Is that Rachel with a boy ? Her poor mother . They 're all talking about us . Yeah , of course they are . We 're special . RACHEL : I should go congratulate Sari . And remember , we 've only been dating for two weeks . Yeah , Rachel , I memorized the cover story . I 'm a professional government agent . Yes , I know , Gary . Just , please , don 't say that to anyone else , okay ? Okay . Oh , and thank you . You really helped me out . Rachel . Ah . I didn 't think you 'd come . Salaam . I know how it is between you and your sister . That 's a wool and silk blend . It 's Italian . So you know your fabrics . Your family in the business ? ( CHUCKLES ) I like jackets . Then you should wear one . ( ALL LAUGH ) ( COUGHS ) You 're sick . You know , sick people shouldn 't come to parties . It 's rude . Papa , are you all right ? It 's nothing , Rachel . It 's nothing to worry about . It 's a cough . ( COUGHING ) No , there 's definitely something wrong . Oh . Please , Rachel . Not now with the smells . No , that 's her ability . That 's what makes her special . Her synesthesia . Gary . Gary , stop . I 'm glad I don 't have it , though . I don 't ... I don 't like smells . Gary , you 're not helping . What is it ? Is something wrong ? Look , I 'm sorry , Mom . I don 't mean to upset anybody , it 's just ... Papa , you need to go to the doctor right away . Enough . Not here , not now . Enough ! I 'm not kidding . Enough ! ( SPEAKING FARSI ) ZAHRA : This is a special day for your sister . Please , don 't ruin it . Do we go back to the office now ? Yeah . ( DOORBELL BUZZING ) Hicks , it 's like 7 : 00 a.m. I know . My God , you look beautiful . Are you okay ? I 'm more than okay . Nina , my life ... My life finally makes sense . But you know how it is . You go along and things are one way , and , like , you start to think that they 're always going to be that way , but ... But then , one day , out of nowhere , it 's different . ( BOTH LAUGH ) Well , you definitely seem different . I want you to come with me , Nina . There 's something I want to show you . Something ... It is amazing . What about work ? We can be late for one day . Come on . Do this for me . Okay . Okay . So , what is it you wanna show me ? Not that I don 't enjoy the tour . I want you to meet my friend , Jonas . He 'll be out soon . He 's preparing to speak at a big gathering this weekend . There 'll be thousands of people . Sounds like a big shot . I 'm telling you , Nina , there 's something about this guy . Something different . Something you just have to experience for yourself . Wait , are you saying that you 've experienced firsthand what this Jonas can do ? Jonas is going to make you see things in a new light . I promise you . These people look pushed . Is Jonas an Alpha ? Nina , I 'm happy . For the first time , I 'm actually happy . I just ... I want you to be happy , too . That 's it . We 're out of here . Hello . Trouble in paradise ? Jonas , this is my friend Nina I was telling you about . Um , I 'm afraid she 's not sure she wants to be here . I know I don 't . How can you know anything ? You 've only just arrived . You 're going to tell me what 's going on here . What you 're doing to all these people . Cameron told me about you , and the wonderful things you can do . It 's not working . Cameron ... Trust me , Nina . Just get us out of here . You 're going to thank me . ( CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) Rachel , did you get me the hummus ? You promised me the leftover hummus . Bottom shelf , Gary . Oh . Huh . I like hummus ' cause it 's all one color . And it 's soft . Is your father at the hospital ? Did you get the test results ? He didn 't go . He won 't listen to me . No , but he has to listen to you . Otherwise ... Otherwise he 'll just get sicker . And then ... And if you get too sick , then you die , and then it 's too late . Gary , I can 't talk about this with you , okay ? No , but you have to talk to me because I 'm pretending to be your boyfriend . I don 't think you 'd understand , Gary . My family ... No , I ... You don 't ... You don 't understand . Rachel . ( STAMMERING ) I always ... I always say what 's on my mind . And you should learn from me . Yeah , you have to go , and you have to tell your father the truth . And then , you have to keep telling him . You have to keep telling him the truth until he pays attention . Just like I do with Bill . Or like this . Like ... Like I 'm doing it with you now . Rachel , come on . You got to ... You got to go , and you got to tell him . And I won 't stop talking to you until you do go , okay ? Okay , Gary . Okay . I 'm looking out for you . ( SIGHS ) ( GASPS ) ( MOANS ) ( GROANING ) ( GASPING ) What happened to him ? Nothing to alarm here . Everyone , back to work . HICKS : He looks sick . Sometimes the darkness overwhelms my followers . I think he needs a doctor . A doctor wouldn 't understand what we 're trying to accomplish here or what 's attacking this man . Our boss , Dr. Rosen , he understands us . He 'd understand you . ROSEN : Hello . Are you here to see Father ? Well , that depends . Who 's your father ? Jonas . He 's everyone 's father . Daddy used to be my father , but they had to burn Daddy up when he got sick . We practice cremation . Environmentally , it 's more responsible than burial . Father ! I want to see the lights . Can I see the lights ? Not now , Teddy . Go find your friends , okay ? You must be Jonas . Dr. Rosen , I hope you 're as competent as Nina and Cameron say you are . I had expected them to meet me here , uh ... I should probably speak with them . Don 't you want to see your patients first ? Patients ? Plural ? Oh , well , Mr. Hicks didn 't go into that much detail in his call . He just thought I was the only one who could help . It 's much more complicated than that . This is it . How long has this man been like this ? A week or so . We can force them to eat and drink a little . But eventually they waste away . And the others ? Some longer . Some less . These people need to be in the hospital . Can 't you help them ? I can certainly try . Well , for starters , this man needs IV fluids . He 's extremely dehydrated . And this woman is , um ... This woman is dead . Oh . She 's been dead for hours . I 've seen it so often . I try to stop it . I try to keep them safe from the world . It 's everywhere . The enemy . I ... I 'm not sure I 'm quite following you . I show them the truth behind the world . It 's my gift . I let them see the light , the interconnectedness of all things , all people . You 're an Alpha . Nina and Cameron , they said you 'd understand . Uh , yes , I have studied people like you quite extensively . Perhaps you could describe , uh , what exactly it is you do . Perhaps I could show you . No , I don 't think that would be a good idea right now . It 'll make you happy and content . I don 't need to be happy or content at the moment . I need to be very focused . People are very sick . You would rather live in darkness ? Uh , yes . For now . Uh ... Could I see Mr. Hicks and Miss Theroux ? I think talking to them would ... It 'd be very helpful . This way . Doc . Oh , this is a bit awkward . ROSEN : Uh , Nina , don 't get up on my account . It 's ... Would you excuse us for a moment , please ? Don 't take too long . Those people downstairs need you . Uh , this might be stating the obvious , but this man has used his Alpha ability on you . Jonas doesn 't call it an ability . He says it 's a divine gift . There 's this light . This light of the world , and it 's in all of us . It connects us . HICKS : Look , Doc , I know it 's hard to understand it 's there , but once Jonas explains it to you , you 'll see it . Everything just makes sense . This might seem all quite miraculous to you , but what you 're experiencing has nothing to do with the divine . This is a result of his ability , his Alpha ability . You should let him show you . Um , well , maybe I will , Nina . Um , but , uh ... Not right now . Uh ... Right now , I need you to put on some clothes and come back to the office with me . Clearly , we have a lot to discuss , but , uh , I don 't want to do it here . I don 't get it . I mean , I thought this is what you wanted for us . For us to find peace . You should be happy for us . I am . Uh , believe me . But we should go . ( BEEPING ) JONAS : Cell phones are a distraction . Part of the white noise of the world that keeps us from truly knowing each other . Oh , have you blocked the signal somehow ? We disabled the only tower for miles . Your patients are waiting . ( LAUGHS ) You 're curing them . Uh , diagnosing them . I believe these people are suffering from a form of encephalitis lethargica . It 's a condition which attacks the brain . It leaves the individual speechless and motionless . Let me ask you something . When you share your ability with these people , they see things , right ? Light , and angels that they draw . They perceive the luminous . There 's a neurological explanation for all of this . Are you familiar with the pineal gland ? Overstimulation can induce hallucinations , brilliant visions , and , often , an overwhelming sense of well-being . You think you can quantify everything , put it into a little box ? If you 'd just let me show you , you 'd see . Well , you run the risk of turning your doctor into another patient . ( STUTTERING ) There is , however , medication which could help . L-dopa . I can , uh , run out right now and bring ... Bring some right back . I 'll send someone . How much do you need ? Well , they 'll only give it to a doctor ... So , write a prescription . ( COUGHING ) Last drop-off is 10 : 00 p.m. Pop ! Rachel ! ( CLEARS THROAT ) It 's late . Don 't you have work in the morning ? Yeah . Look , back home , in Tehran , when you were a doctor , ( SIGHS ) what would you do if a patient wouldn 't listen to your recommendation ? But you 're not a doctor , and I haven 't been one for a very long time . ( COUGHS ) Papa , you 're sick , and you need to get help . Rachel , I 'm tired , I want my dinner . Hey . Hey , listen to me . When Sari and Darius and I were little , and we got sick , you brought us our medicine , you made sure we got our sleep . You never left our side . You 're my children . And you 're my papa . And , Papa , you have cancer . In your throat . And if you don 't do something about it soon , you will die . You will not see your grandchildren , you will not walk me down the aisle . You 'll be gone . All because you were too stubborn to listen to your loved ones . I , uh ... Now . Are you going to go to the doctor , or do I have to talk to Mom ? You were such a quiet , obedient child . I 'm not a child anymore . Tomorrow , okay ? Or I 'm coming back . ( CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING ) ( PUMPING GAS PEDAL ) Oh , no ! Shoot ! ( SIGHS ) Dr. Rosen , Jonas is looking for you . JONAS : Maria Parsonetti came to us a drug-addicted runaway . She ascends now . May her soul be blessed as it returns to the great light . And together , we say , amen . ALL : Amen . The woman didn 't have to die . You 're going to have to burn a lot more bodies before this is done . This is how it 's always been . If these people 's lives mean anything to you , make sure it ends differently this time . RACHEL : Pop , I 'm so glad . You 'll let me know as soon as you get the test results , promise ? Pop , I don 't need to be protected . I need the truth . Okay . Did you ask if there 's any more hummus ? I really like the hummus . Gary , I will get my mom to make you as much hummus as you want . Guys , guys , guys , where is everybody ? I 'm calling their phones , texting , no one 's answering . Yeah . Dr. Rosen never turned up to drive me . He didn 't pick you up this morning ? No . My mom had to drive me , and she said that I made her late for work , but she made me late for work , too . No , Nina didn 't come home last night , and actually , she hasn 't returned any of my texts . I think I heard her leave with Hicks yesterday morning . Gary , can you please ... Yeah , yeah , no . Ping , ping , ping . Out of area , out of area , out of area . What does that mean ? It means out of area . It means no one 's near a tower . What , all three of them ? Yeah . It 's weird , because I can only ping them if they 're near a tower . Gary , you 're going to have to figure out something else . I 'll check Dr. Rosen 's computer . Bill , did you know his password is ... No , I don 't ... I don 't ... S-W-1 ... Gary . M-M-3-R . It 's " swimmer , " but ... Gary , do what you gotta do . But it 's numbers instead of vowels . Let 's go check the computer first . It 's clever . I set it up . ( EXHALES ) Well , it doesn 't seem to be working . I ... I ... I could increase the dosage , but I 'm afraid it might kill him . Maybe it 's meant to be . Um ... Mr. Englin , uh , you said it 's always been like this . When was the first time this happened around you ? I was very young . My father was a preacher . He was the first person I gifted . Mmm . And he realized I 'd been given a divine calling . So , he brought you into the family business , so to speak . I was helping people . The entire congregation was grateful . And then , people started getting sick . People you 'd gifted ? My father said it was the Devil 's work . That the darkness was trying to steal back my gift . He prayed on it , and then he saw how to save everyone . Uh , how exactly did he do that ? He purified his congregation with fire . ( PATIENT GASPING ) ( MOANING ) It 's ... It 's working . Did I do anything stupid ? All I remember is glowy lights and feeling really , really good . Like a speedball , but way better . I gave you insight , not a drug . Call it what you want , but put that in a bottle , I 'd crawl right inside . Do you feel any connection at all with that man , or , or anyone else right now ? I just want to go home . That could be a problem . Rachel . Yeah , right . Gary . Bill . Bill . Yeah ? Dr. Rosen 's last Google . It shows that he went to Connecticut . To a house that used to belong to Fred Bask . And he ... He was old , and he died . And then , he gave his house away as a gift . To the Reverend Jonas Englin . He 's some sort of a religious leader . Yeah , and he 's speaking tomorrow at a big church ... Wait , wait , wait , so Rosen is with a religious group ? What the hell is going on ? Excuse me , where 's the medication that was here ? Father took it away . Of course I took it . Gil may live , but your poison robbed him of my gift . Mr. Englin , your gift is what is killing those people . That is a lie . It 's not me ! It 's the world . It 's the darkness . I understand that you 're going to be speaking at some sort of religious gathering . To spread the light , yes . It 's what I was meant to do . You 're going to expose all these people to your ... Your ability ? Dr. Rosen , you 've seen the pain , the indignities all around us , the terrible things the unenlightened do to themselves and others . I can change that . Or is this broken world enough for you ? Making people sick , killing them , it ... That 's not going to fix anything . So , will you please give me back this medicine , ( SIGHS ) so that I can help your people ? Do you know what the worst part of my gift is ? I can 't feel it . Like you , I 'm trapped in the darkness . I would sacrifice everything , even my life to experience for just one moment what I give to others . So , tell me what 's better , a lifetime of suffering , or a short time in paradise ? You don 't have the right to make that choice for people . Well , neither do you . No more poison . You have to come up with another answer . Find a way to give my people paradise and life , or the others are going to die , too . Including Nina and Cameron . RACHEL : Stop . This is the address on Dr. Rosen 's computer . Okay , I 'm picking up a lot of heartbeats , 40 , 50 , at least . HARKEN : Do you at least hear Rosen or Hicks or Nina ? RACHEL : No . It 's too far , even for me . These dead bodies look like barbecue chicken . Gary , not appropriate . This guy scares me . Like Jim Jones scary . Well , let 's just hope he hasn 't started handing out the purple Kool-Aid . Rachel , I need a visual on an entry . RACHEL : Front door 's covered . There 's some windows , Iow , on the side , that nobody 's watching . We can go in that way . Wait , no , no , no . I 'll go in alone , okay ? RACHEL : No . No . No . I go alone . If you don 't hear from me in 20 minutes , you call tactical , let them know it 's a hostage situation , okay ? Bill , that 's wrong . Okay , under no circumstances are you to follow me in here , Gary . Okay . Okay . ( COCKING GUN ) Doc ! Bill ? Bill , you 've got to get out of here . Right now . Bill . Nina . Give me the gun . Come with me . Nina ? Nina ! Nina , don 't do this . ( DOOR LOCKING ) Nina ! RACHEL : Okay . ( EXHALES ) Tactical 's on their way . No , you have to sterilize my phone ... What ? ... when you use it . Gary , I 'm sorry , my ... Bacteria . Ear wax . I know . I know . I 'm sorry . My phone does not work up here . Here . It 's clean . Thank you . This is wrong , though . Bill needs us . I bet he 's in trouble right now . We should just go in . Hey , no ! Bill said no ! Come on , Rachel . I don 't hear any gunshots , and there 's no fighting . We wait . The police are coming here . HARKEN : It 's not the police . It 's DOD , so that means assault rifles , flak jackets , armored vehicles , and helicopters . I 'm sorry . I didn 't ... I didn 't know that ... You can call them off , right ? No , I can 't . They think it 's a hostage situation . They think I 'm a hostage and Hicks and Nina , and Dr. Rosen , and ... I must pray on this . We 'll be all right . You guys have been holding out on me , huh ? I had no idea . HICKS : I know . I needed this . Everyone should feel this way . Everyone will . You were a mistake . I never should have agreed to bring you here . No , you were right to bring me here . You wanted to help these people and so do I. I just need more time . Time ? To find a treatment ? Or time for your government thugs to invade my home ? No one wants any violence . I can bring peace to the entire world . Why would I let anyone stand in my way ? Jonas , you 're so much more than your ability . Your message about , uh , connectedness and that there 's a light in all of us ... That is worth hearing . Those are just words . Without my gift , they 're just words . Words have power . No . You want to make me into a charlatan . No . Faith healing and revival tents , and " Bless you for this donation . " Jonas , your ability is killing these people . I gave these people paradise . Once they experience it , they can 't let it go . How do you know ? Have you asked any of them ? What about Gil ? He was ready to drink again . You 're asking me to let you tear it away from them ? No . I 'd rather die first . So would they . My father understood that . I never did until today . This time I won 't run from the flames . You 'll burn , too . But you 'll never know paradise . ( EXHALES ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Hicks , do you wanna give me a hand ? Getting lazy on me , Bill ? No , I ... I amped up , but it didn 't work . It was weird . ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( BOTH GRUNTING ) ( GROANING ) NINA : Cameron ? Cameron . Cameron . What 's wrong ? He 's been called . We all have . ( GASPING ) Oh , shoot ! ( GRUNTING ) Don 't be afraid . You came to me broken . Looking for answers from the pain that infects this world . And I healed you , I showed you the light . The connection , not just to each other , but to something greater than ourselves . The outside world doesn 't understand it . They think everyone should live in fear and darkness . It frightens them that we live free and without worry . And now , they are beating down our walls trying to destroy what we 've built here . It can 't happen today . Today the light that shines from me , shines for us all . Join me in the light , and we 'll spend eternity together . What are you doing ? It 's all right . Dr. Rosen , take your poison out of here . Put the torch into the furnace , Jonas . Please . This is the only way out . Please do it . Hey . Five hundred milligrams to as many people as you can . You got it . JONAS : Nina , don 't listen to him . No . Don 't . Just don 't move . JONAS : Bill , no ! ROSEN : Jonas , you can 't control them anymore . I 'm not going to let you bring darkness into my house . Don 't do this , Jonas ! ( CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ) Go now ! Now ! Go ! Get out of here . Move ! Go ! Go ! Come . Come on ! ( SIRENS WAILING ) Hey . Jonas 's victims are responding to the L-dopa like you said they would . I think tactical 's got everything under control . We can go . Dad ! Dad ! I talked to Mom . She said cancer . Stage one . It 's very treatable . They never catch it this early . But then no one else has a daughter like you . I 'm so glad . You 're a miracle . Now , your Aunt Parashtou . She 's coming to dinner . Eh , she 's got a mole she needs you to look at . Okay . Hey . Hey . So , group should be interesting today . We 're not going to talk about it , right ? What happened between us ? I figure that 's a private conversation . I 'll just pretend it never happened . I 'll talk about Tyler , and how he 's leaving , and how I can 't stop it . Still can 't believe Rosen saw us naked . ( CHUCKLES ) Doc , you ready ? We 're waiting on you . In a minute . You okay ? ( SCOFFS ) Am I okay ? I killed a man , Bill . No , you killed a bad guy . And saved a whole lot of folks from being barbequed . That 's the part you hold onto . ( SIGHS ) How does it feel ? The light ? Oh , I , um ... Never felt better in my life . I still can 't amp up but I 'm glad to be among the breathing . You know , Bill ... The DOD is going to cover this whole thing up . If you kill someone , you should pay a price . You are definitely paying the price . So , why don 't we just go and talk about it with the group ? Or not . Or ... Okay , Dr. Harken . I like that . I have some advice . Next time , aim for the chest . It 's an easier stop . I was aiming for his chest .

 Do you remember being upset when you came here ? Yeah , I was quite upset , wasn 't I ? What was it all about ? I don 't know . I seem to have forgotten . It doesn 't seem important now . Bite down . Good . Sir , you have to leave now . We have to move the body . The train 's coming ! Wait . - Come on ! - Wait . Hurry ! Whoo ! Come on ! - I don 't know if it 's safe . - It 's fine . Careful . Whoo-hoo ! Ahh ! Whoo ! Yeah , yeah ! Whoo ! Whoo-hoo ! Whoo ! It 's gone now . Come on . Were you scared ? You crazy lady . ♪ You 're gonna comfort me ♪ If I can be there in time ♪ I 'm not claimed Yeah ... ♪ Enough to feel ♪ Enough to see now ♪ And enough to know ♪ No , no , no , I 'm not claimed I 'll have one more . Mm . Mm . Happy anniversary . I love you . Allex . Who are you ? We met at the bar . Don 't you remember ? Open it . J 'ai tout papillon noir . What ? It 's a French expression for having dark thoughts . " I have black butterflies . " Whoever you are , just ... Just leave me alone . I want to help you . You want to help me ? I want to help you stop drinking . Don 't you want help ? Mm . Look , I got to go to the emergency room . Right , just cover for me , all right ? I-I 'll be in as soon as I can . Well , you already have stitches . I know . That 's why I 'm here . What exactly happened ? I don 't know . You don 't know ? You know , blacked out , I think . Hmm . I 've never been here . You won 't find me on ... Sir . " A-L-L-E-X . " Well , you were here last night . You came in drunk , cut by a knife in a bar fight . They gave you 11 stitches . No , this thing is wrong . You 'll need to see a doctor in a couple of weeks to get the stitches removed . - Aren 't you gonna help me ? - You 've already been helped . No . This thing 's wrong ! How would you know ? You blacked out . If you 'll excuse me , there 's a room full of people who actually need my help . The usual ? Yeah . Let 's just keep it one , though . Hair of the dog . You got it . Hello . You shouldn 't have gone to the bar . It 's you . Well , why did you cut me ? I was only doing what you asked . Don 't you remember ? Well , uh , that 's bullshit . I-I didn 't ask you for anything . You asked me to help you . But you fucking cut me . We 've already started . - W-what do you mean , started ? - Started what ? The treatment to help you . Our experiment . Don 't drink . Don 't black out . You do , they die . What ? Man , fuck you . All right , I don 't drink and drive no more . Don 't drink , Allex . Fuck you . Ohh . Ow ! Aah ! Hello ? Did you watch it ? What did you do ? Me ? That 's you , Allex . No . I would never do that . But you did . I made you . What ? When you black out , you 're no longer yourself . That 's bullshit . It 's your choice . Stop drinking , no one else dies . What did you do to me ? When you 're cured , Allex . And don 't go to the hospital again . I promise you you won 't make it there this time . I was there last night . That 's where you did this , huh ? Really ? Is that what the medical records say ? For your own good , no hospitals , no doctors . I wouldn 't want to have to forward that e-mail to the police . Look , tell Sean I 'm sick and I 'm not coming in . Hello ? Chad . It 's Allex . Hey , man . How you doing ? Uh , I need to talk to you . - Sure , what 's up ? - Not over the phone . I got to talk to you in person . You 're still messing around with electronics and microchips , right ? You know it . Come on over . Hey , dude . Come on in the back . Okay . It 's like a snuff film . So , it 's real ? No , I-it can 't be . Snuff films are all fake . Somebody 's messing with you . I need to know if somebody else is doing that , or if it 's really me . You couldn 't do that . If it 's me , it wouldn 't really be me . It 'd be somebody controlling me . Shit . Is it even possible ? I don 't know . You said there was metal in there ? Yeah . That could be an implant . You could have wires leading up to your brain , sending electrical signals . That 's kind of how the brain-pacemaker thing works , and that 's been around for years . Brain pacemaker ? Yeah , it uses deep brain stimulation to treat epilepsy and major depression . So , you 're saying it 's possible ? They 're not even sure how the pacemaker works , and it 's a different form of control . But maybe this thing can do it . Man , you 're talking some seriously complicated shit . Your guy would have to be some kind of combo scientist / tech doctor genius . What you need to do is get to a hospital and see what the fuck is inside of you . - He said no hospitals . - You have to . What other options do you have ? Don 't worry about this video . It 's got to be fake . Yeah . One whiskey coming up . Yeah , make it half , will ya ? A half ? Yeah . All right . Oh , hey , Charlie , um ... You know , say , like , uh , you do a crime and , you know , somebody 's controlling you , but you don 't remember it ? You ... you wouldn 't be responsible for it , would you ? - What are you talking about ? - Hypnosis ? I don 't think anyone 's gonna buy that . I mean , your body does the crime , you 're guilty , right ? Yeah , I guess . It 's all about the fingerprints , not the mind-prints . - Hey . - Hey . Right . Night . It has to be fake . Help me ! Please , please . Please help me . Ow ! Ow ! Aah ! Now do you believe me , Allex ? Now do you understand that the experiment is real ? The other one ? Is real . I didn 't read anything about it . Do you really think society will miss them ? They were carefully chosen . Gail , she drank . That 's all . She was a hopeless drunk . She would have killed herself or others soon enough . What about him ? A drunk , too ? What , you think it 's okay to just kill people ? I 'mnot killing anyone . You are . I have high hopes for you , Allex . Your recovery can pave the way for others . And that 's how you 're stopping me from drinking ? I am motivating you to cure yourself . I suggest you clean up . I don 't want your treatment interrupted by others . Be thorough . The experiment has to stay controlled . - What 's up , buddy ? - Chad . Uh , I need you to come over here , man . - What 's wrong ? - Just ... just come over , please . Yeah . Whatever you need , man . - Did you go to the doctor ? - Look ... I don 't want to talk about it on the phone . Dude , that is me right there . Yeah . H-happened right up there . Explain it . Maybe he did it , and then he set it up like you did it in the video . No . That 's me . This is real . She 's dead . They 're both dead . If they 're dead , then where are the bodies ? Why is there no blood ? I do ... I don 't know , all right ? I don 't know . See ? It 's bullshit . What about this ? Huh ? He 's controlling me , man . M-maybe he just put some metal in there that would trigger the metal detector . We need to get to the bottom of this . Let me set you up for a C.T. scan . He told me no doctors . I know people . We can do this under the radar , and there 's no way he 'll find out , I swear . - All right . - Then what do I do till then ? - Nothing . - I want you to do nothing . I want you to sit tight till tomorrow . I 've got an idea . What 's that ? It 's a camera . It 'll send a signal to your laptop . It 's motion-triggered , so if anyone goes in or out of here , we will know . Let me see your phone . - Why ? - Just give me your phone . I 'm downloading a tracking app . So no matter where you go , it will track you whether you remember ... Or not . I have a present for you . Jesus . Safety 's on the bottom so you don 't fry your balls off . Be careful . My design packs a wallop . The hell are you into ? Some overseas shit . No crime , no foul . Just remember , you get in trouble , you use that . Hello . Where have you been ? Sick . I called . Didn 't you get the messages ? You were hung over . No . - That 's it . - Don 't bother coming in tomorrow . I 'll have your stuff shipped to you . Do you hear me ? Allex , do you hear me ? Oh . No way . Ohh . Where 'd I go ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Are you admiring your work ? How did you know where I was , huh ? Just don 't leave any fingerprints . I didn 't black out , though ! But you drank . I do appreciate your cutting back , though . And that 's why I gave you a reward . A reward ? I let you kill someone you might find more deserving than your beloved drunks . You did this , not me ! But it 's your body . Hello ? Hello ? ! - Hey . - I 'm getting out of town . Where the hell are you going ? Away . Why ? I can 't be near anyone , all right ? It 's gotten worse . I think I killed my boss . Listen , I need you here to be checked out . - It isn 't safe . - Just find out what you can . Aah ! Aah ! Hello ? Hello ? Yeah , you 're alive . Let me help you . Come here . I 'm gonna turn you over , okay ? - Uh-huh . - Okay ? Huh ? It 's okay . Go slow . Go slow . - I 'm gonna get you out of here . - Come on . I 'm so sorry . - Don 't be afraid . - It wasn 't me . Don 't be afraid . I didn 't do it . I 'm here to help you . It 's okay . It 's okay . No . Oh , no . No . I 'm gonna save you . I 'm gonna save you . No , you 're not gonna die . You 're not gonna die ! You 're not gonna die ! Come on . No ! I tried . I tried . Fuck . What the hell happened ? I got it out . At least just part of it . Just take it . Oh , shit . How 'd he find me ? Allex , wait . Allex ! Why do you have these , huh ? ! Why did you choose Allex ? ! You sick fuck ! Why didn 't you tell me ? ! Fuck . Shit ! No . Come on . No ! Come on . You shouldn 't have done that , Allex . It 's all in my hands now . I 'm gonna fix you . I haven 't given up . Hmm . Huh ? What are you ... What did you put in me now ? - Nothing . - I just took the rest out . You already ruined that experiment . Why don 't you just leave me alone ? If I had left you alone , you would have died . He 's fine , no thanks to himself . I thought you 'd be pleased with the selection . I always do my research , and I researched you and your friends thoroughly . You should be thanking me . Curing him will be a bonus for you . You were never so inquisitive before . And ... what did you think I was gonna do ? And you didn 't care as long as you were paid . Why are you doing this ? To help you . Help someone else . I already have . You are my second experiment . So , it 's real ... That disk . You wecontrolling me . Control is a bit of an overstatement . I was ... Guiding you using basic commands , and then , when the time was right , I triggered a violent response by simultaneously stimulating portions of your brain . It doesn 't work unless the patient is unconscious past R.E.M. sleep . That 's something that happened quite frequently with your blackouts . That 's why you picked me . I can sedate anyone . I chose to help you . It 's out . Just leave me alone . Let me go . Wouldn 't be much of a scientist if I just let my experiments run away . Whatever you are ... You are no scientist . Shut up . You ... Shut up ! Shut up ! Maybe this is for the best . Sometimes the old ways are better , tried and true . A transorbital lobotomy through the eye socket . There 's no need for drilling . It avoids such complications . It 's a delicate procedure , takes a bit of finesse , but in the right hands , it 's very safe . Patients are up and about in no time , productive members of society , free from hyperactivity , schizophrenia , depression , and addiction . - You 're mad . - Really ? Yeah . Well , it 's a lot more fair than experimenting on rats . Or the homeless . Or children . You have no one to blame but yourself . You already checked out of society before your liver gives out . The least you can do for this world is be a little useful . What is that ? It 's an old E.C.T. Machine from my grandfather 's practice . Three short bursts of an electric current , and you will be under long enough to complete the procedure . You won 't remember a thing when you wake up . But then , you 're already used to that , aren 't you ? A couple of taps of the hammer to breach the frontal bone , and then I simply push in a couple of inches , twist the tip around to sever a portion of the prefrontal lobe . You 're fucking crazy . There have been over 40,000 lobotomies in the U.S. alone . That 's a very tested procedure , on human beings , no less . Rats and monkeys are so 20th century , don 't you think ? Fuck you ! I 'll kill you . That 's the alcohol withdrawal talking . Allex . Allex . How you feel ? I 'm not sure . See if you can sit up . Good . Good . Now try standing up . Take your time . Excellent . Excellent . Full motor control . You see ? You 're still yourself . You 're not a zombie . You 're not a vegetable . You still have control over your actions . I know ... I know it 's a needlessly vilified procedure , but one that has hopefully cured your addiction . What are you doing ? I 'm taking you home . What are you doing ? You 're not even trying . You have to at least make an effort . Come on , get up . Get up . You 're determined to not make this easy , aren 't you , Allex ? This is bigger than just you and me . Society can 't function without functioning people . Our citizens are our greatest resource , and this country can 't afford to have that squandered anymore . My grandfather understood that . He knew that each person had to face his demons and make their contribution . And that 's why he took care of me . My father couldn 't ... Because of this . It corrupted his mind and his body . There are consequences . There are always ... . Consequences . My brother , Samuel , Sam ... I saw this . My father ... my drunken father took something from him that wasn 't his , and you want to know what it was ? His life . A boy can 't forgive . The dead can 't forgive . But the living can be helped . My grandfather showed me that . He gave me that gift . And you have to realize that your actions have a tangible ... Effect . Don 't expect me to be passing out . With that thing cut out , I wasn 't sure how you were tracking me . I figured this would bring you out . You know , your friend 's a minor genius when it comes to designing and assembling components . It 's too bad you couldn 't hold onto it . You need to stay quiet ! Stop it ! I told you to stop it ! Don 't make me come in there ! You want another treatment ? ! It 's okay . Sorry about that . God ! God ! Wha ... what ... what ... What are you gonna do ? You were wrong about lobotomies . - No . - They mess you up . They change you . I can still remember who I am , or at least who I was . I remember what I decided to do , and that 's to kill you . Oddly , I don 't feel like there 's anything to hold me back . I 'm trying to help you ! And now I 'm going to help you . - I don 't need your help . - It 's already been done . I 've already been cured ! It didn 't go deep enough . Hmm . Hmm . - Hello . - Thank God . I ... I 've been worried sick trying to reach you . - Where are you ? - I 'm in the desert . You 're still there ? My car is stuck . Can you come help me ? Sure . Send me the pin of your location . Allex ! Hey . What he do to you ? It involves an ice pick . You 're coming with me . - No . - I 'm serious . With that thing out , no one 's controlling me anymore . Allex , I want to help you . Then follow me . Where the hell is your car ? Over the Ridge . Did you find out where those things came from ? I 've been trying . They 're comprised of a bunch of different components , most of them manufactured in Asia . Who put it together ? - I don 't know . - Your guy , I guess . What are you gonna do if he comes back ? He 's not coming back . So don 't expect to be shipping any more orders . You lied to me when I came to see you . No , I didn 't . I didn 't know what was happening to you had anything to do with those disks , not until you showed me the one that you took out . Don 't act so innocent . I 'm not acting innocent . I just designed them to his specs last year . I didn 't know what they did . - You volunteered me . - No , I didn 't . He thought experimenting on you was some type of reward for me . He 's a sick fuck ! Fuck ! Allex . This isn 't you . Ow . Allex . Help me . Help me ! Where are you going ? ! Allex ? ! Allex , you 're not a murderer ! It isn 't you , Allex ! Help me !

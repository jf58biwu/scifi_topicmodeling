Enemy combatant is hostile , repeat that , NCR Streetgang . They are reprogramming our weapons , changing the target . Pull back to a safe position , Streetgang . I want to make this clear . Do not send any missiles towards the object . Your comments are noted , pilot . Thing is going down . The only thing going down is you 're going to kill a lot of people if you don 't abort those missiles . You are to pull back immediately or face charges of insubordination . ICBMs have been reprogrammed . ICBMs in sight . I 'm taking them out . Switching to guns . Breaching E.M.P. barrier . Losing power . Move that down to the gunnery ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move your asses , airmen ! Whoa ! Whoa , whoa . Sorry , son . You are not on the flight roster . Yeah , but , Sarge- - Now is not the time to bust my balls , Laughlin . You want to help out , join the recovery unit . That 's an order . You are number one for takeoff . Copy ? Affirmative . Listen up , Arnstead . We got the go-ahead to engage the enemy . You 're to follow protocol clean-sweep . Now , we don 't know who or what the hell is operating those things up there , but we 're gonna show ' em what for . You got that ? Yes , sir . I don 't care if you have to kamikaze your ass . You 're gonna take ' em out . You hear me ? Do not disappoint me . I 'm ready for takeoff , sir . Arnstead , you 're gonna take that bird to the air , or I 'm gonna come down there and kick your ass with some serious attitude . I 'm ready for takeoff , sir . If you 'd just get that piece of crap out of my way , I 'll take off . What piece of crap you referring to , Solano ? Do not refer to my bird that way . I 'm talking about Arnstead , sir . Requesting permission to leapfrog his position , sir . He probably needs some time to change his diapers . You hear that , Arnstead ? You better move that bird , or I 'm gonna order Solano to shoot you there right where you lay . Come on . Pull it . You hear me ! Come on . You 're becoming a major embarrassment to my Air National Guard if you don 't get your ass in gear , I 'm gonna have to come down there and punch your teeth out myself to gain our honor back . Grab the stick . Come on . Come on . Solano , you sit tight . Arnstead , this is your last chance . You get that bird out on the runway . I 'm talking to you . You hear me ? Now you done it , Arnstead . I got one bullet left in my service revolver . I was saving it for a special occasion , like meeting some chap who thought he was the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler , but now I 'm gonna have to use it on you . I 'm gonna come down there and blow your brains out , and it pains me to think that you 're brains are gonna be spattered all over my beloved bird . Sir ! Incoming ! Move ! Damn it . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! You chupas are not gonna get me . Aah ! Go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Cease fire . Cease fire . I think he 's got smoke inhalation . Commander . We gotta get our boys under cover , regroup . We 're getting our asses pickled out here . Medic ! Whoa . Fall back . Look out ! Get your head out of the- - Let 's go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . Come on . Let 's go . Move out ! Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Look out ! Sir , HQ says there 's an emp front right about to hit us . Once it does , all communications will be out . For how long ? Undetermined , sir . Sir , this remote base we 've set up is designed to function under this kind of a scenario . We should be able to get our communications back up and running pretty quickly . We ain 't dealing with the Russkies here . What kind of intel have they got on this emp burst ? Sir , they say it affects everything from low ground to high orbit . They 're not sure how long the rebuild 's gonna take . So what the hell are we supposed to do ? We have to find the nearest ham radio . Ham radios utilize vacuum tubes . They 're impervious to electromagnetic pulse . What the hell are you dressed like that for , solider ? Captain Pete Rodgers Fourth Interceptor Squadron . Where the hell have you been ? I 've been in the air , sir . They sent us on a reconnaissance mission to investigate that thing . The Battle of Los Angeles . Do you remember the date of your mission , son ? Yes , sir . February 13 , sir . And would you happen to know what year this is , son ? I don 't know , sir . I 'm sorry , soldier . I hope you didn 't have a fiancée waiting for you back there , because- - it looks like you left on your mission 68 years ago . Your mission was in 1942 . That 's correct , sir . Incoming ! Move out ! Move it ! Move it ! Move it ! Hadron , hang back . Check for the emp pulse . Yes , sir . Sir , we have 2 minutes until it hits us . Okay , I need a sat-com . This is a priority-one message for air command . We have a Captain Pete Rodgers from the Fourth Interceptor Squadron with us , the missing 1942 flight . You got that ? Run that up the pipe for me , will you ? Find me the nearest radio ham operator . Yes , sir . Space-time conundrums may not be my expertise , but I don 't have to be a physics Professor to know that you , son , are probably the key to all this . You got anything ? Yes , sir . There is one civilian ham radio operator . A Charlie Murphy . What 's his location ? I 'm working on it now , sir . HQ , HQ , we need Charlie Murphy 's address immediately . HQ . This is a military channel . Clear the channel immediately . Sir , someone 's jamming our transmission . God ! Then tell ' em to clear ! Clear the channel immediately . I repeat , this is the military channel . HQ , this is 144 . We need Charlie Murphy 's address now . Emp pulse is coming . 4 , 3 ... HQ , HQ , we need that address now ! HQ , I repeat . 2 ... This is the 144th . 1 . We need Charlie Murphy 's address now . Hadron , where are we ? It 's coming ! Sir , no . But command gave us the new orders . They said we gotta get this guy to sector seven immediately . MJ-12 . Yes , sir . MJ-12 . Those coordinates are about five miles from here . Okay , Hadron , take Laughlin , Newman , the rest of your crew . Get Rodgers to L-7 , okay ? Maybe we should all go , sir . Negative . I 'm staying back here to check the wounded , see what we can salvage from this God-awful mess . What are you waiting for , an invitation ? You heard the man . Move out , double time . I don 't think we want to be caught out here with our pants down . Let 's go . Laughlin . You found him . He 's your responsibility , okay ? Yes , sir . Let 's go . Sir , Sector Seven 's that way . No , Sector Seven 's this way . No , but , sir- - I appreciate you trying to help out , Laughlin , but directions , among other things , are not one of your strong suits . Let 's go . Fall out . ¿ Que paso ? What took you so long , gringo ? Hey , Solano . You got company ! Foo fighter . You got one--uh , three of ' em on you . Where ? ! They 're under your fuselage . Hey , they 're like frickin ' remoras . What ? You know , they 're hanging in your slipstream . Not if I can help it . They 're still on you , Arnstead . Damn it . What do they want ? Why don 't you ask them ? Arnstead . Arnstead , hey ! Arnstead ! Answer me , man . What are you doing ? Arnstead . Arnstead ! Arnstead ! Hey ! Arnstead ! What are you doing ? Arnstead , where you at ? Arnstead . Arnstead . Arnstead ! Ahh . Arnstead ! Arnstead , come in . I 'm talking to you . Ahh . Ah , hell , no . That 's right . Come here . Come here . Show me what you got . Mmm . Yes . Mmm . Whoo ! Yeah . That 's right . That 's how we do . What do you got ? Sir , right there . I don 't--I don 't know what that is . What the hell is that , one of their bombs ? Yeah , but h-how did all the people die ? Those look like projectile wounds , piercing rounds of some sort . Okay , look , we could backtrack . You go around , and I 'll outflank it . Yeah . We need to know what we 're dealing with . You stay here , protect Rodgers . If I don 't make it back , you have the command . You 'll be safe here . Bavarian steel . They don 't make it like that anymore . Holy- - No ! Ohh . Aah ! Ohh . Cover me ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Golden ! I didn 't tell you to move ! Fall back ! Hey , look . That thing 's trying to draw us in . It wants to pick us off one by one . There 's no way we 're gonna get to the Captain . Look , Newman , I got command , all right ? Look , I 'm not winding up like Golden or the rest of those people . Unh ! We gonna take this thing out ! When I was in captivity , they tested those things on us . There is a vulnerable spot , but you gotta get really close . How close ? Closer than him . All right . I got a plan . Stay low . Stay low . Go . Go . Go . Go . Go . You should have left me . Sir , give me your hand . Aah . Aah . What are you doing ? Throw that thing ! Timing is everything . Guess I found out what we 're dealing with , huh ? Don 't try to talk , sir . We 're gonna get you out of here , all right ? It 's okay . Leave me . I can 't keep training you idiots forever . You gonna take these things out , right ? Yes , sir . I don 't want to be reincarnated , come back and find little green men running everything . No , sir . That 's not gonna happen , all right ? Good . You have the column . Look , man , we should just go back to HQ . We don 't even really know who sent that message , man . It could be an alien trick or something . No , we gonna follow our orders . Orders , man ? Everybody 's dead . What do you mean , " follow our orders " ? Newman , you want to go , then go . I 'll just consider it your resignation . But I tell you what . If you gonna go , you gonna have to relinquish that weapon . Look , you two can stay here and fight this out , or you could act like soldiers and finish your mission . It 's your choice . What you gonna do ? Screw it . I 'm with you . All right , then . Come on , man . That 's Solano 's . There 's no way she survived that . Nah , nobody kills Solano but Solano . Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Let 's go ! I 'm gonna go get Solano . You watch Rodgers . Look , stay here , and keep your head down . Had to make sure you weren 't trying to go AWOL on us . All right , look , I 'll cover you . You run . Ain 't gotta tell me twice . Run ! Unh ! Come on , Laughlin . I got you . Solano ! Come on . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on ! Aah ! - You cool ? - Yeah . Tell you one thing . They don 't come in peace . We gotta keep going . All right . Go . Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Come on , man ! What are you doing ? What are you gonna do ? I don 't know , Solano . Maybe I 'll take a break . It 's been a long day . Go . I 'll cover you . I 'll cover you . Go . Go . Ah , man . Ahh . Man , I gotta get me one of those . Yeah . Me , too . I 've got to get you to headquarters . You in charge here ? Second Lieutenant Tyler Laughlin . Captain Karla Smythe , Majestic 12 Group . Nice job . You 're only about a half a mile off your coordinates . Let 's go . Stop ! Hide . Inside . Clear . Let 's move . Aah ! All right , let 's move . Move ! Move ! Move ! Let 's move ! Come on ! Come on . Do it ! Go . Do it ! Come on . Come on . Come on . Let 's make it . Let 's go ! Go ! Just keep going . Go ! Everybody inside now ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Move ! Everybody inside . Inside now ! Keep moving . Don 't stop . Go ! Go ! Go ! Move ! Let 's go ! This is Sector Seven ? Yes . You have power . A limited supply , yes . What about an emp blast ? It 's a nonissue . It is to the rest of the planet . Thanks for sharing . You 'll need to relinquish your weapons . Heh . Well , I 'm considered a deadly weapon . What are you gonna do about that , big boy ? Look , I don 't mean to insult your boys , but we 're not giving up our weapons . There are 14 levels above us . That 's over a mile of concrete and steel . What are you trying to say ? Nothing gets in unless we let it . I don 't have any weapons . It 's cool . Come on . Was pretty much out of ammo anyways . Replenish their ammo . Ma 'am . This could be a weapon . I 'm gonna stay and make sure he replenishes our ammo . Suit yourself . Colonel Mekin . Captain Rodgers . Thank you . Thank you for bringing him to us . Sergent Galaway , take these two down to the chow hall . Looks like they could use some grub . We 'll stay together if that 's okay , sir . We 're a unit . Not a problem . Novak , go grab some MREs . Captain ... it is a pleasure . You have been gone such a long time , and you have not changed one bit . Welcome home . You the one in charge ? I am , and I would like to debrief you now . I have a message for you . Outstanding . Follow me down to the debriefing room , and let 's get started . No . I need to tell you now . Captain , we need to discuss this in a secure environment . Colonel , if your people don 't release the one they 're holding captive , they will never stop . Do you understand ? They 'll tear this world apart hunting for him , and they will not stop ... ever . We 're not holding anyone . There 's no time for games . They sent me back here to give you this message . They only want him back . Who ? Who do they want back ? The one you call Kaor . Do you speak their language ? I can . A bit . If they 've ship Rodgers back here ... to give your little friend a message . I think that 's a chance we have to take . You know , once he talks to it ... he can never leave this facility . Mmm . Nah . Mmm ? Lot of stuff . Mmm . It 's good . For the record , I think this is a bad idea . But since you 've been its baby sitter ... I 'm gonna let you make the call . Let 's do it . We used to stop you right here and make you sign an agreement that you wouldn 't reveal anything you see beyond this door . With what 's happening up there ... doesn 't really matter anymore . One more thing . Does anybody got some Reese 's pieces ? Damn thing loves ' em . It prefers this wavelength of light . Karla , did you understand that ? I can 't be sure . Captain Rodgers .

Hey , uh , don 't want to be a back-seat pilot , buddy , but maybe you should take some evasive action . Unh ! Unh ! I don 't think we can hold out much longer . Wait . I got the shields .

An emergency developing throughout NASA and the space community . We now know that the meteors will land off the coast of eight different cities . And that number could keep rising . Evacuations now underway in Southern California . Moving the population back from the coastline . But a lot of curious people are clamouring for views as ... Why are you doing up so early ? Lieutenant , still gonna get used to that . This thing right ? Here ... - It 's shaking . It 's gonna be parallel to the deck . That 's the whole thing with these bars . - Okay ... I 'm gone .

Take it you heard we maybe mobilizing ? - Yes , sir . Moving you up to squad leader . It 's a big responsibility . You can handle it . Thank you , sir . Staff Sergeant Beck is replaced by Staff Sergeant Nantz . What do you know him ? - He 's a very dedicated Marine . Don 't bullshit me , Corporal . What 'd did you hear about his last tour ? Just the grimy details that everybody else knows . But at the end of the day you 're our lieutenant and we take our orders from you . Sir . So you 're gonna be assigned to 1st. platoon under the second Lieutenant Martinez . His platoon sergeant 's on leave , So you 're gonna have to suck it up . So here 's the lieutenant , right up here at 1 o 'clock . He 's a kid , Mike . Right out of Officer training school , he 's only with us a month . But I think he 's sharp . It 's just an evacuation , buddy . He 's in charge . Just keep an eye on him. huh ? Just don 't lose my paperwork . Afternoon Lieutenant . - Good afternoon , Staff Sergeant . Happy to finally meet you . - Thank you , sir . We 've been called in , to help with evacuation , Lieutenant . Because of these meteors ? - I assume so . Whatever it is , I 'm just happy to finally get out in the field with the men . At approximately at 4 : 42 am pacific standard time . The meteors impacted ... Who the hell took my tortelini ? You got tortelini ? Think , this is some kinda drill or what ? - Get ready , man ! Get ready . This is serious . Okay ? Meteorites continued to fall off the coast of California ... Ireland and the Bay of Bengal . Corporal . - Yes . Probably just a training exercise , right ? No , man ... they shifted Nantz into our unit . Something must be going on ... That 's great , the guy wants out of the Marine Corp. And now we 're stuck with him . Stav ! You 'd got tortelini 's ? Well , I heard Nantz kicked asses his last tour . I mean he went into that compound alone and killed like about 10 insurgents ... Didn 't he ? That 's what you heard Lenihan , huh ? That 's what you heard ! ? Yeah ! - Chill out ... Johnson and Foxtrot told me , - Hey ... he was going on like some ... - Don 't worry about it ... The hell did I do ? Nantz got a couple of guys killed on his last tour . What are you talking about ? - Well , that 's the story . Lockett 's brother was one of them . So ! Now , I know you didn 't know about this ... Lockett , man ! I 'm sorry ! - Man , don 't worry about it ... Looks like we 're getting into some heavy shit . It 's been my experience Lieutenant ... heavy shit is highly overrated . Look , Staff Sergeant . Let 's just be clear . I know your rep , I know what 'd you 've done . This is my platoon , these are my men . Not gonna have a problem , are we ? No problem , Sir . She 's all yours . It appears our inital assumptions were wrong . Alright ! Listen up ! I want you to get your weapon ! Get your gear ! Get your muntions ! Move outside ! White chocolate wrap for my men and that should finish the new mix , right ? Good No ... ! - National Guard troops have flown into ... evacuate surrounding meteor areas . And we have word the military is now deploying . Aw , that 's us ... ! Armed military for a meteor shower ? - I don 't know why they 're so happy ? Just a minute . A meteorite just hit the ocean , Large plumes of smoke are coming up ... Visibility is getting worse . These objects were completely undetectable until they entered our atmosphere . NASA estimates that they are not hitting the water at terminal velocity . They 're slowing down before impact . These objects in question ... are falling into the ocean in tightly packed clusters . 10 miles outside a major population centre . Thermal imaging from the Hubble telescope shows us that ... within each cluster is a central object much larger than the others . And these central objects are all the same geometrical shape . They appear mechanical in nature . This is not a meteor shower , Marines . We are in threat con Delta . That 's right ! C 'mon ! All units ! Gear up ! Be ready to move ! Combat situation . - That 's what I 've been training for . And just now being told that one of the Coast Guard cutters have issued a mayday . It is difficut to see . Oh my gosh ! There 's just another meteor that just hit the ocean . And it 's the closest one yet . Right behind those cutters ... There are two or three meteor 's just impacted ... Do we have that information from the studio ? Oh my god . Hey , hey ! Are you hearing us ? Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Hey ! Are you still hearing us ? Yeah . Jean , I can ... I can hear you . What is that ... ? I can 't really get a good look . But It appears like there 's something ... I ... I am looking for the people trying to determine exactly what this is . Maybe ... I don 't even know ... like shadowy figures ... Maybe 5 , 6 , 7 . I can make out ... maybe ... What the hell is that ! ? - holy shit ! Look at that ! ? I think I 'm gonna head back now ! Everyone needs to get outta here , right now ! I think I 'm gonna leave , Jean . I 'm gonna head back . Oh my god . Corporal Grayston and Corporal Imlay are both expert marksmen . As well as strong Fire team leaders . We also have PFC Lenihan who is our second best marksmen . Just behind Lance Corporal Guerrero . Yo ! What 's your take on this , Specks ? I don 't know . Extraterrestial ? You mean like from space ? - No , Imlay ! From Canada . Oh ! You 've always got jokes . Don 't you ... Alright ! First squad ! Line it up ! Bring it in ! Let 's go ! As you may have heard already ! Staff Sergeant Nantz will be taking over for Staff Sergeant Beck ! We 're lucky to have him aboard ! Alright ! Here 's the situation , Marines ! We 're facing an unknown enemy ! We don 't know how strong they 're force is , or what they 're capable of ! But one thing we do know ! Is that we 're fighting for our land ! Our families ! Our home ! And our Country ! God dammit ! So whatever those things are ! ? Let 's go show them how Marines fight ! Retreat ! - Hell ! 25 ! - Shake Hell ! Let 's go ! First it . Last out ! Marines ! Breathe Lenihan ! Breathe ! Your training will kick in ! - Thank you ! Staff Sergeant ! Got something to get off your chest , Corporal ? No ... it 's cool Staff Sergeant . You got a Silver Star , my brother came home in a box . I get it . All stations , stand by for sitrep . Enemy elements have advanced beyond the beach . Aliens ! ? That 's not possible ? Right ! ? We 'll know soon enough ! Brother ! It 's in case his head gets blown off , so that they can identify his body ... Yo ! Staff Sergeant ! ? Promise me you won 't let me be taken alive by some godless predator from another world . Staff Sergeant ! No promises in combat ! Stop screwing around and keep your head in it ! My dearest wife . We 're not evacuating civilians fast enough . I say again : We 're not evacuating fast enough . All units be advised ... There are friends behind enemy lines . You gonna take me to dinner first lady . - Boys , better hold on to something . Things are about to get rough . Let 's go ... ! Form it up ! What have we got , sir ? - Right . The situation is as follows ... Most of Santa Monica 's been cleared of civilians . We 've got a defense line at Lincoln Boulevard a mile from the ocean . Air Force has got Warhogs and B52 's on deck . At 19 : 30 hours , they will pound the entire area at Lincoln to the ocean . We 're leveling Santa Monica , sir ? - We 've got a infestation and God knows what ! But they are not of this earth ! And we gotta hit them with everything we got ! We got to hit ém hard ! They are ground force enemy only . They have no aircraft ... so the airforce will tear them a new asshole . And we WILL rule the air . You said , MOST citizens , sir ? - That 's a firm . Get a distress call , sending squads out . Golf : you take Santa Monica to Olympic . Foxtrot : Olympic to Peaco , Echo : Peaco to Ocean Park . Lieutenant Martinez , I want you to break off a squad and a machine guns team . Proceed west from Lincoln to a police station located here . Venice and Amarosa . Venice and Amarosa . Police were overrun . Got a distress call that civilians are still there . We don 't know how many ? Just gather survivors and you radio in . We 'll have helicopters in the area to evacuate you out . But be advised ! You 've got exactly 3 hours before our bombs drop . Make no mistake they will DROP . With or without you . So you get those civilians and you get the hell out of there . And you kill anything that is not human . Let 's go ! Let 's get it done ! Captain , this is not a drill . You hold that line . You understand me ? - Yes , sir . 10,000 moving inland , they are advancing east from the coastland into the suburbs . Golf company is overrun , Lema company is requesting immediate air support . Civilians are been stranded behind enemy lines . Take on 1 ! - Fire in the hole ! Troops are amassing on every coast , along every major coastline . The U.N. has called an emergency sitting in an attempt to establish a means of sharing resources ... Watch out ! Go ! Which is ? This way ? Where we supposed to go ? Jesus Christ . Marines . Anything beyond this point . Considered to be hostile . Nice and easy . Okay . Hell of a way to earn your citizenship , right ? Shit ! I 'd rather be in Afghanistan . How many civilians you 'd think we gotta get out of that police station ? I have no idea , Guerrero . Just stay focused . Hey , what the hell is that ? What is that ? - This is insane . Ya , it 's open . - Unidentified enemies has reached our coastline . In a swift and military sneak attack . At this point , there are many more questions unanswered . Right now one thing is clear , the world is at war . See something , Simmons ? Can 't see shit . Kerns ! You see across the street ? Lieutenant , I don 't see nothing .

Now , put that away . You understand me ? Right now , your men are awaiting orders . You go left , you can go right , I don 't give a damn . Just make a decision . Lieutenant . There 's no go on the helo , sir . Enemy aircraft 's slicing it up . Command says it 's nothing they ever seen before . We got to find a way out . We got to get to that F.O.B. You 're right . We gotta move . Let 's get these people safe . Lockett , Kerns ! I need you to setup an observation post on the roof ! We gonna move by foot so we got to move fast ! I want you guys to scan for hostiles . And find the best ride outta here ! Lieutenant . Officias are now saying : any civilians within 10 miles of the coast , should try to make their way to a military Forward Operating Base ( F.O.B. ) . It 's the safest place you 're gonna be right now . Now the military has set up a line of defense to try to protect civilians . Authorities ... - Just look at you and make sure you 're alright . Alright ? Just look at this ... Here you go . Our Staff 's just there , Mr. Rincon . - Okay , thank you . No problem . - Thank you ... Joe Rincon . - Staff Sergeant Nantz . This is my son Hector . We ... we all wanted to thank you for coming to get us . Yeah ? Hey , Hector . We leave no man behind . So you 're here when the police got overrun ? Right , well as long as you 're both okay . Are you alright , man ? - Ya , ya . I 'm good . Okay . If ... If you need him to do anything . You know ? - I 'll let you know . Aye aye , sir . Alright . Thank you . We 've got 2 dozens hostiles . About 300 meters out . Lieutenant , we 've got 2 dozen hostiles . 300 meters north only . Those things are on overwatch . Just like us . That one out front looks like a leader . So now they 've got leadership . Yeah , so do ants , Kerns . You think those things get scared too ? They 're probably just like us . Grunts just told to go fighting . C 'mon ... Just find us a way out of here , marine . Cause we 're sitting ducks . They dragged him outta the house . And they brought him outta the street And they put him in perfect order before they shot him . They shot him right in the head . Do you have any idea ? Why this is happening ? Well , it 's clear that there 's been no attempt at any kind of communication . No demands , nothing like that . So ! Obviously , they are here for our resources . When you invade a place for it 's resources . You wipe out the indigeous population . Those are the rules of any colonization . And right now . We are being colonized . Brave kids . - They 're my nieces . My sister and her husband are on vacation . The thing is ... they live in Arizona . I see them once or twice a year and ... Now maybe I 'm the only one they have left . You have children ? - No . Neither do I. Used to regret that . Maybe ... it 's for the best . And of course our planet 's is 70 % water and so again I have to stress this without certainty , the leading hypothesis remains . Their objective , their target is our water . There ain 't gonna be nothing left . I think I got a way outta here . What 'd you say ? - Right here . Look . 200 meters out , What 's that . Right behind that backside there ? Bus . - Lieutenant , we 've got a bus . Roger that . - So the men on the roof saw bus . I think it could be operational . Maybe we 're be better off on foot . It 's miles to the Forward Operationing Base . Those bombs are gonna drop in a little more than an hour . We gotta move fast . A bus is a big target . I 'd made the call . It 's my responability . Stavrou , Harris ! Lieutenant , needs recon on a bus . If it runs . Get it back here . Either of you know how to hotwire a bus ? Stavrou can . He 's from Jersey , sir ! Ladies first . 200 meters . You go down . There 's cars parked out . There 's a pickup truck , right ... right back behind that . We have a situation . Ya 'll need to follow me . Harris found it out here . Ya 'll got to see this thing ! Weapon looks like it 's been surgically attached . Talk about commitment to cause . Shit ... You got to be kidding me . - Corporal . Hold it . Let me shoot this damn thing Staff Sergeant . That weapon 's still hot . Let me just shoot it . Doc ? - Yes , Staff Sergeant ! God have mercy . We need to know exactly where to hit this thing ? So we don 't waste our own ammo . Maybe I can help . I 'm a veterinarian . Sure you want to do this ? I was more sure when I was standing over there .

I thought you were a doctor ? Animals and Aliens only . I 'll put it on my to do list . Thank you . Excuse me . Staff Sergeant ? Did you say that was an unmanned drone ? - Correct .

Yeah , the coordinates for a missile strike on a Command and Control Center . But the acid fell off the grid . And we lost them . All side streets are blocked . Why don 't we stick to the freeway .

Here we go . This is Lieutenant William Martinez . Echo Company , 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines . Hoo-rah ! We 're still half a click inside the bombing zone . Move to live , Marines . Did he just leave the lieutenant back there to die ? Sure looks that way . And this is the guy in charge of us now ? Let 's move . Hey ! Those are our jets . We 're still in the fight . Alright , clear the bomb zone . Let 's tighten this place down . Bombs drop in 6 minutes . Santos , Kerns . On me . See if there 's any comms . Alright ? Hard wired only . We 're clear ? - Yeah ! We 're clear ! Do you have a hardline in here ? - Over there . Now my son 's a optimist . When ... when this first happened . He said Why don 't we try to go talk to them . Maybe they wanna be friends . Hector ? Hey , we 're gonna get some food and water for your dad okay ? It 's okay . What 'd you tell him ? I said the ... you know . If they 're chasing and shooting us . They 're probably not good friends . Should 've followed directions and gone to the F.O.B. I should 've never stayed at the police station . But I was scared , man . I ... I made all the wrong decisions . You trusted your gut , Mr. Rincon . You made a call . I 'd do the same thing to protect my Marines . I had a situation on my last tour . There was no angle.You want left , you go right . It didn 't matter . But you 're alive . - Yeah , I survived . I wasn 't suppose to . Staff Sergeant Nantz ? You promise to save my son ? Staff Sergeant ! We have a hardwire connection ! Doc , keep him warm . The sun 's going down . This will keep you warm . We estimating that 20 cities in 17 countries are now into full attack . It 's obvious the enemy is attempting to cut us off from one another . Is there anymore information at this time , Professor Stavert ? New data shows that their using our water as their fuel ... and our ocean levels are already decreasing . They 're using it to power their ships , their machinery . Possibly even their own bodies . It 's the composition of our water that 's unique . It 's in a liquid state . No other locations in our known universe have liquid H20 . Anywhere near their surface . I just saw a field report that said ... they would use our sewer system to follow ... our water back to their ships . - How the hell did you get that to work ? These things are everywhere . There 's one off the coast in 20 countries . They 're calling it the Command and Control Center . It is who you were tracking ? - Yeah . So you 're saying . That 's the thing controlling the drones . Yeah . And if we wipe it out . We take out their air power . These bombs better work . Move it ! C 'mon ! _ Put him into a safe spot . Set him down . How much time we got ? 1 minute . Air Force better lay some pain on those extraterritorial bastards . Alright ! 25 ! Retreat ! Hell ! Retreat ! - Hell ! Here we go . - C 'mon . Let 's fry these son of a bitches . We 're get to the F.O.B. after these bomb drop . Get some ammo . And some god damn reinforcements . God damn tanks ! 10 . - You gotta be strong , okay . 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 Bloody brace ! Hey ! They should 've dropped ! - Shit ! What the hell ? We 've felt them from here if they 'd had dropped ? If they 'd had dropped by now . We would 've felt from here , wouldn 't we ? Should 've felt them from god damn Nevada with that much joyness ! That clock right ? - That 's what I got . Maybe it 's a good thing , right ? Maybe we 've turned the tide . I mean ... I mean that 's a good thing , right ? You 're damn straight , Imlay ! We were kicking some ass out there . Could they have taken out the whole air force ? This isn 't happening . Let 's move ... Everybody up , up . Let 's move . C 'mon . Home stretch ... home stretch . Now we know why those bombs didn 't drop . They wiped the Forward Operating Base right off the map . All clear , Staff Sergeant ! Alright , Let 's bring ém back here . I feel like it 's a million to one odds , we 'd get here in the first place . We 'd get here and ain 't nothing ! I knew Nantz would never get us out . There were thousands of Marines here . - Now there 's just seven of us , Imlay . You remind me of my older brother . How 's that ? He never smiles either . Secure the front with Harris . Imlay , anything ? - Nothing , Staff Sergeant . We 'd only got maps of Santa Monica . We need something further east . They 're all burnt . Follow me , Imlay .

Staff Sergeant ! Adukwu , plenty of weapons around . Find yourself an M16 . Mr. Rincon is dead . Please get up , dad ? Please , don 't leave me . Don 't leave me . I 'm so sorry , Hector . I 'm sorry . Your father tried so hard to stay with you . I don 't want to be here . It 's okay , bud . Your father was a brave man , Hector . Hector , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , buddy . It 's okay to cry . He loved you very much . Listen to me , Hector . I need you to be brave for me , I need you to be my little marine . Okay ? We gotta be brave for the others . You know why ? Why ? Because Marines don 't quit . Do you believe that ? Say it for me . Marines don 't quit . Good . I want to get you out of here . I promise . Let 's go see the priest , okay . Come on . We 're not losing one more of those civilians , understand ? You getting us out too , Staff Sergeant ? Or are we expenable ? Hm ? Alright , Lockett . You want to go there . Let 's go there . I commanded men . And men died . Kids . 18 years old . Best men I ever led . Do you think that 1 second . That I 'd rather trade places with them ? I know you think I got my men killed . They 're dead . I 'm here . Like the punchline of some bad joke . You think I like that ? You 'd think a minute goes by that the faces are right here . Seared into my brain . Dante , Thomas D.

Keep fighting . That 's how we honor your brother and Lieutenant Martinez . Corporal Stavro , Lance Corporal Mottola . Hector 's father . Who picked up a weapon and did what needed to be done . Civilian did that . So we better damn well step it up ! Discard any lingering doubt ! Work fast ! Work as a unit ! and we will prevail ! Let 's figure out how to get out of this mess . Imlay , you come with me and get to higher ground . Rest of you ! Find some ammo . Some vehicles . Gotta be a few LAVs or armoured humvees still operational . Sorry , bro . You didn 't deserve this . You went down fighting . Holy shit . No one expects to see all this . Now that don 't look good . Reinforcements . Holy shit . They already set up a B10 . Alright . If that evac site is still operational . I think we can get behind the line . That 's gonna be a hell of a ride , Staff Sergeant . - Yeah , that 's what we get paid for . Everybody move to the LAV . Now ! Follow me ! - Go ... ! Any station , this net . This is Foxtrot 2 November . We have 11 passengers . Requesting evacuation at alternative extraction point , Charlie . Are there any birds in the air ? Over . Foxtrot 2 November , this is Sierra 25 . Orders are to pull back . Get to evacuation point : Charlie . By 0300 . Or we 'd be gone . Over . Roger that .

How many clicks is that blackout ? It 's about 5 clicks , Staff Sergeant . 5 clicks . Alright . We 'll use this overpass for cover . If we can take out those drones . Our military might have chance to get back into this fight . Santos ? Where would you put a Command and Control asset , if you want to protect it ? Underground ! - Let 's go . Move ... Move . They must 've gone back up . It just leads back to the street . I thought they were leading us to the Command and Control Center . Dammit ! Let 's go . They know we 're here now .

Laser target , Staff Sergeant ? We don 't have any more planes , alright . Hopefully , they can still fire ground to ground missiles from Edwards Air Force Base . So we 'll radio in a strike . Paint the target with the laser , guide them in . Aye , Staff Sergeant . - Hoo-rah . Our best chance of radio reception is on top of that building . But it 's the most exposed .

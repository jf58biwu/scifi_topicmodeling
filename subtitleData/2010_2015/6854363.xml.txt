 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : Whatever they needed from you , they have it . It 's not safe here anymore . You have to go home . OLIVIA : You 're not real . BROYLES : What about this Olivia ? - I don 't believe we need her . Get me out . Despite what you think , my universe is not at war with yours . I 've seen war , but if what you 're saying is true , I have to believe in hope . Please make this worth it . PETER : Since you got back , it 's like you 're a different person . WOMAN ( OVER PHONE ) : Olivia , she has a message for you . She 's trapped in the other universe . BROYLES : Olivia 's back . They think she had some kind of seizure . If it wasn 't for you , I would never have made it back . You saved my life . - Excuse me . - Sorry . So , so sorry . ( MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) MAN : Yes . There 's a man here in need of medical attention . 5776 Galloway Street . He 's injured very badly . Please hurry . Cheers . So sorry , sir . But , uh , there 's no other way . ( GASPS ) - No details on this one . - Never a good sign . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Hello ? Somebody call 911 ? Someone call 911 ? Hello ? Call this in . EMT : Dispatch , we 're looking at a possible homicide . Requesting backup . Oh , my God . Joe , someone cut this guy 's heart out . Get in here . ( GASPS ) Don 't ... Don 't let me die . Fringe s3e09 Marionette Guess you weren 't expecting me back so soon . ... Which led me to believe that Walternate 's priority was learning how to cross universes safely . - He was using me to discover how . - You think he 's close ? His tests enabled him to synthesize Cortexiphan . Yeah , I think he 's close . And he is driven . The way he sees things , it 's his world or ours . So I understand that the other Olivia escaped with a crucial part of the machine . Where is the rest of it ? Science Division is analyzing the pieces . - I 'd like to see the results . - Of course . Once you 're back . You 're officially on leave until further notice . To say you 've experienced a trauma is an understatement . You need to process what you 've endured . I know , but I honestly believe that my ability to do my job isn 't impaired . Your ability 's not my only concern . I 'm not gonna deny that the last few months haven 't taken their toll . But I made a promise to a friend over there . And I swore that I would do everything that I can to heal both worlds . I need to go back to work . This friend you 're talking about what was he like ? He wasn 't that unlike you . He was honorable , committed . He feared for his family , for their future . - So he had children ? - A son and a daughter . And he was very close to his wife . - And he was still married ? - Yes . - Come on , Walter , let 's go . WALTER : Coming . I thought that it was in the closet . Aah ! Wait . - Where was it ? - Bathroom . A couple nights ago I used my cauterizer to remove an uncomfortable growth between my ... Less information the better . - Have you spoken to Olivia ? - I did . Called her last night . She 's still recuperating . I understand how difficult it is to be candid with people you care about . Particularly when it concerns matters intimate in nature . - Ready to go ? - Yes , I am . - And by intimate , I mean sexual . - Yeah , I got that . I know this is an instance of a parent asking a child to do as he says , not as he does . How many ways can I tell you I don 't wanna have this conversation ? But you must have it . No , this conversation , the one that we 're having right now . We 're here . You understand better than most the pain a lie can inflict . Yes , I do . Which is why , even though it 's going to fundamentally change how she feels about me , I am going to tell Olivia everything . Okay ? You 're a good man , Peter . She knows that . WALTER : Look who 's here . Oh , it 's good to see you out and about , dear . - Peter , look , it 's Olivia . - Hi . Shouldn 't you be resting ? Agent Dunham has been cleared for duty . - All right . In that case , welcome back . - Thank you . Gonna tell us what we 're in for ? At 8 this morning , 911 received a call from inside this house . The caller said there was someone in need of medical attention . The EMTs found the victim strapped to a table chest cavity opened , and his heart missing . After they discovered him , the victim regained consciousness and spoke and died three minutes later . He was conscious and speaking without a functional cardiovascular system ? - It appears so . - Lady Fortuna has smiled upon us . Where do you suppose I could pick up quality imported pickled herring ? No idea . Why ? - I 'm thinking of Scandinavia . - Scandinavia ? The blood eagle . Norse method of torture . Breaking the ribs and spreading them out to resemble blood-stained wings . - So we 're looking for a Viking ? - Whoever did this was trained . These incisions have been made with precision . Huh . This is beautiful work . Definitely not a Viking . They were ruthless . Peter , look at this . PETER : Scar tissue . WALTER : Yeah . He 's had heart surgery before . Stay here . I 'll be right back . WALTER : Well , it 's impossible to determine the time of death . In this case , the standards we generally use don 't apply . What exactly does that mean ? - He still has reflexes ? WALTER : Yes . And yet his heart was removed at least four hours ago . Rigor mortis should be starting to set in . So we 're not sure he 's dead ? From what I can see , he 's more dead than not . Okay . What if somebody is harvesting organs ? - On the black market ? PETER : Unlikely . This guy 's medicine cabinet rivals some pharmacies . Steroids , immunosuppressants , antifungals , pain medication ... You wouldn 't steal a heart from someone sick if you were selling it . - Who 's the prescribing physician ? - Dr. Alexandra Ross . You two go talk to this Dr. Ross . Dr. Bishop , I 'll arrange to transport the cadaver to your lab . Oh , great . Perhaps there I 'll be able to discover what made this Tin Man tick . - Dr. Ross is still in surgery . - Okay , then we 'll wait . You know you 're drinking swill , right ? It 's nice to be able to take a cup of coffee for granted . What ? You know when you go on vacation and come back and things are a revelation ? Like coffee or my favorite shoes . And then other things are just ... I don 't know . My mail was opened . It 's kind of disconcerting , knowing that somebody else has been living your life . Hey . You okay ? There 's something that I have to talk to you about . About her . I noticed changes . Small changes , but they were definitely there . She 's ... She 's much quicker with a smile . And less ... I don 't know , less intense , maybe . She said that when she was over there , when she saw her other life it made her wanna change , to be happier . I believed her because that made sense . There was no way for you to know . Everything happened so fast . I couldn 't tell you how they did it . And that 's okay . I 'm here now . When you asked me to come back to this world with you ... - ... you said ... - That you belonged with me . And so I came back for you . For us . And we started seeing each other . And I explained away the differences because our relationship was different . I thought she was you , Olivia . Does everyone know ? PETER : I reported everything when I found out who she was . Olivia , I 'm sorry . ( CHUCKLES ) You know , she had a really full life a really sweet boyfriend . And if he hadn 't been out of town , who knows what could have happened ? She had friends , people who loved her . People who risked their lives to help her . They all believed that I was her . So you know , I can understand how that ... - Mr. Bishop ? Dr. Ross is out of surgery . - Give us a second , please ? - Sure . Okay . PETER : Thank you . Peter , it 's fine . We 're good . Let 's go . I don 't understand . His heart was removed ? We 'd like to ask you about the medications you prescribed him . Of course . It was the standard regimen for transplant recipients . Mr. Russo suffered from congestive heart failure . On the list over a year , waiting for a donor . - He had a heart transplant ? ROSS : Yes . He wanted a second chance . We gave him one . Or at least I thought we did . ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ) It won 't be long now . You 'll be okay . ASTRID : Walter , are you sure it 's called the Yatsko Project ? Nina says that she checked Massive Dynamic 's archives ... - ... and nothing came up . - That can 't be right . Belly and I created a serum similar to this in the mid ' 70s . I 'm certain of it . We were trying to devise a method ... - ... of questioning someone after death . - Of course you were . Tell her to look under " pet projects . " Perhaps the Yatsko research was folded in . Okay . I 'm leaving . Peter 's giving you a ride home . He should be here any minute , Walter . Evening , everyone . Peter . What wonderful timing . - You got the keys to lock up ? - Yeah . No problem . All right . Don 't let him keep you here too late , okay ? - Night , Walter . - Good night , Aster . Peter , come here . Good night . I want you to smell something . Tell me what you deduce . - Okay . What am I smelling ? - Him . Notice anything ? ( SNIFFING ) - I 'm not vomiting . - Precisely . By now , it should be emitting the unmistakable odor of putrefaction . This corpse 's decomposition has slowed to almost zero . - So , what 's arresting the decay ? - That 's a good question . Astrid and I isolated traces of a serum in his blood . It functions as a preservative , radically slowing down cell degradation . Why slow down his death ? They stole his heart . To assuage his conscience . You think the type of people that would steal an organ ... - ... would be troubled by conscience ? - He called 911 . If the EMTs had got him on a heart-lung machine in time he might have survived . It 's highly unlikely , of course but I 'm betting it helps our organ thief sleep well at night . Well , at least somebody is . You haven 't told Olivia , have you ? - Nope , actually I did . - How did she react ? - Surprisingly well . - Really ? Hmm . Do you think possibly they replaced her with a robot ? ( SOBBING ) - Hey . Tell me there 's more . - There 's plenty . I just made a fresh pot . Great . Bad night ? I had a lot of laundry to go through . How is it , being back ? - Oh , it 's good . - Yeah ? Strange . ( CHUCKLES ) Peter told me what happened , you know , that he was seeing her . You know , I get it , but ... You saw them together . What was he like with her ? He didn 't seem different ? I mean , like , happier , or ... ? - Olivia ... - I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . I ... Okay , we should go . Broyles wouldn 't have called if he didn 't have something . Olivia , wait . - He thought that she was you . - Yeah , I understand . It 's fine . It 's not fine . Whatever feelings that Peter had , they were not about her . They were about you . And they were real . They still are . Thank you , Astrid . BROYLES : A cross-state search turned up multiple organ thefts in the last two months . The incidents took place in five states but the MO of the crime is consistent . - The same person did all this ? BROYLES : It appears so . - Any of those organs transplants ? BROYLES : They all were . And not only that , they 're all from the same donor . - Do we have a name ? - A number . Names are confidential . A 17-year-old female . We 've issued a priority request . We should know shortly . PETER : Mind if I take a look ? So he 's gathering all of her organs . Why ? Some people have objections to organ donation . Someone didn 't think the recipients were worthy . It says here they remanded the custody of the body to the Rosendale Eye Bank . Think her corneas were donated ? There 's no photos of them being stolen . Put me through to the Rosendale Eye Bank . Colonel Broyles with the FBI . I need to speak with your executive director immediately . Yes , it 's urgent . Immediately means urgent . Thank you . ( MAN 1 GROANING AND SHOUTING ) MAN 2 : So sorry , sir . These don 't belong to you , do they ? Good . He wasn 't at home . We 're at his restaurant now . Thanks . That was Astrid . We 've got a name on the donor . Amanda Walsh . Her family lives in Providence . FBI 's arranging an interview . There 's a light on in the back . Hello ? Anybody there ? PETER : Over here . We 're too late . ( METAL CLANGING NEARBY ) ( GASPS ) Please help me . I wanted to see how the construction was coming along . There was some paperwork to take care of . I was feeling fine , but as I was walking there I started getting dizzy . Next thing I know , I 'm strapped to a slab . ( CHUCKLES ) He actually apologized . Can you believe that ? He said he wished there was another way . That they didn 't belong to me . So Walter was right . We 're dealing with a remorseful organ thief . Well , that makes sense . He didn 't wanna hurt those people . It 's about her . He didn 't want her organs going to someone else . I 'm gonna call Broyles , let him know we 're on the way to talk to the family . ( JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ) ( GENE MOOING ) Please tell me you 're not giving Gene the evidence to drink . Not till I understand the long-term side effects . But imagine the possibilities if this can permanently arrest cell decay . - Milk that doesn 't go bad . - And cheese . ( CHUCKLES ) Well , that dream is gonna have to wait , Walter . Here are the Yatsko Project files . Massive Dynamic just sent them over . You were right , they were misfiled . Turns out the research you and William Bell did on human tissue preservation didn 't stop when you went to St. Claire 's . Interesting . I think we 're on the precipice of understanding this . - More you than we . - I have a working hypothesis . Astrid , I need you to get me something . I need the organ donor . - Amanda Walsh ? - Yes . I need her body . Or what 's left of it . MRS. WALSH : Oh , God . The only consolation I had was her passing gave other people another chance . Was Amanda dating anyone ? Did she have any friendships that were cause for concern ? I was more concerned that she didn 't have any friends . She didn 't like school , she didn 't wanna do sports . It was ballet . That was the only thing that ever made her happy . Ms. Walsh , how did your daughter die ? She took her own life . - My daughter was clinically depressed . - Was she being treated for depression ? Yes . She was on anti-depression medication . She also did a lot of group therapy . She kept trying different ones . There are a few she stuck with . We 'd like the names of the doctors and also the groups she was attending . ( PHONE RINGING ) Excuse me for a sec . I 'll get that information . - Hey , Astrid . - Hey , are you at the Walsh house ? - Yeah , why ? - Well , Walter has some kind of a theory . He needs you to speak to Mrs. Walsh . Okay . What 's he need ? MRS. WALSH : Amanda 's schedule , her psychiatrists the groups she was going to . - If there 's anything else I can do ... - Actually , there is . That was Astrid on the phone . Mrs. Walsh , we 'd like your permission to exhume your daughter 's body . You can 't . I know that 's an awful thing to ask but ... MRS. WALSH : No , it 's not possible . Walter . ( SIGHS ) - Here she is . PETER : I hope there 's a good reason ... - ... given all that family 's had to suffer . - There 's a good reason . - Walter , come on . That 's a person . - Oh , my God . No , not at all . I suspect it 's some kind of hardwood . Cherry , maybe mahogany and concrete . - Are you sure ? - I know these are not human cremains . If that 's not her , then where is her body ? Likely with the rest of her organs . I believe whoever is stealing these organs is trying to put this girl back together again . MAN : It 's gonna be good for you . Very good . We need to keep your body strong , don 't we ? ( CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS ) ASTRID : So the funeral home didn 't report it . You 're kidding me . Okay , thanks . Broyles just confirmed your suspicion . Amanda Walsh 's body was stolen before it could be cremated . The funeral home covered it up . Apparently , stealing bodies is not all that unusual . Of course not . Theft of corpses ... - ... is a time-honored tradition . - Tradition ? We 've been stealing from the dead as long as we 've been burying them . Perhaps longer . In the 1800s , grave robbery was the primary means that doctors and scientists had of obtaining human cadavers for study . In fact , that practice was so common that it inspired the Gothic novel Frankenstein . - You may have heard of it . - You don 't believe it 's possible to bring a dead person back to life , do you ? No . But not for lack of trying . Belly and I dabbled in that arena for years . But , alas , we never could revive Yatsko . Peter just loved that cocker spaniel . Feel that . Finally some stiffness . Okay , I 've removed anyone who doesn 't have a medical or scientific background . - What about this guy , Ellis Rourke ? - What group was he in ? Uh , general depression . He and Amanda ran it together ... - ... for almost a year . - Okay , hit me . Age 36 , majored in biology . Has an anger-management problem . Arrested twice for battery . No . Whoever 's doing this isn 't driven by anger . Broyles asked me to drop these records off . Okay , thank you . I got it . Oh . Amanda was also in a cognitive-behavioral group that focused on ways to cope with depression . You 'd think someone working that hard at being okay would get some payoff . - Well , it doesn 't always work like that . - I think I got something . Simon Waylan , age 29 . Says here that he is " socially and sexually incompetent . " No , it doesn 't fit the profile . I appreciate that profiling is one of your specialties but you could listen to what I have to say before you dismiss it . Well , he is not the guy we 're looking for . - So , what am I missing ? - What do you mean ? We 're looking for somebody who knows Amanda . A loner who has difficulty making friends . Who more than likely has parents who live far away or are deceased . Which would bring me to Simon Waylan . Twenty-nine , computer programmer , bachelor , lives alone . Also , just happened to leave the emergency contact sheet blank . " He displays symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder . " Caring about other people is not his strong suit . - Sorry , but he 's not the guy . - Right . So why not ? Profiling is not about checking off the facts . You have to weigh them . - You gotta feel it . - So , what ... ? He doesn 't love her . Whoever 's fighting to give Amanda back her life even though she chose to end it , loves her . - Okay ? - Okay . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be . Let 's just move on . - What is it ? - Roland David Barrett . Worked in animal research but it 's not him . He dropped out of the group last spring . - When last spring ? - The last session was April 10th . The day that Amanda committed suicide . " Barrett is the son of Nathaniel Barrett , heir to the Stanfield Chemical fortune . " Ten years ago , when his father passed away , Roland inherited everything . Does his post-doctoral work on cell decay and regeneration but quit abruptly because of an onset of severe depression . Then , four years ago , he picks up his scientific work at the Duk-Hee Genetic Institute . There were hundreds of different researchers . But according to this , Barrett 's research contributed to the " creation of synthetic life on the cellular level . " - What if he could actually do it ? - What ? Reanimation . ( EKG FLAT-LINING ) Okay . ( GASPS ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( EKG BEEPING ) ( WHEEZING ) BARRETT : Amanda ? Amanda , it 's me . It 's me , Roland . You made a terrible mistake but it 's okay now . You 're back . I told you I 'm gonna be there for you the way you were for me , remember ? ( GASPS ) Okay , it 's okay . Hey , hey , look at me . Look at Roland . ( BARRETT SOBBING ) Oh , no . MAN : FBI ! ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Go , go , go . Move , move ! ( METAL CLANGING NEARBY ) Where is she ? Downstairs . Clear . ( METAL CLANGING ) I was trying to correct a wrong . - She made a mistake . - What was your relationship to her ? I just wanted her to have another chance . I wanted her to live a life . Her eyes . When I looked into her eyes it wasn 't Amanda . I don 't know what I brought back , but I know it wasn 't her . Is she dead ? Yes , she 's dead . You know what I need after a day like today ? For most people , it would be a drink . - Strawberry milkshake . - I can do that . - With extra whipped cream . - Don 't push it . Olivia ? You okay ? What is it ? You know what Barrett said ? He said that he looked into her eyes and he knew that it wasn 't her . Olivia ... I understand the facts . I know that she had reams of information about me and about my life , and about the people close to me . I understand that if she slipped up that she would have a completely reasonable explanation for it . And I guess to expect you to have seen past that is perhaps asking a little bit too much . But when I was over there , I thought about you . And you were just a figment of my imagination but I held on to you . And it wasn 't reasonable , and it wasn 't logical but I did it . So why didn 't you ? She wasn 't me . How could you not see that ? Now she 's everywhere . She 's been in my house , in my job , my bed . I don 't wanna wear my clothes , I don 't wanna live in my apartment and I don 't wanna be with you . She 's taken everything . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sorry . ( PHONE CLICKING ) SEPTEMBER : I have arrived . Yes . I am looking at him as we speak . He is still alive .

 - Who is this ? - Another Olivia Dunham . Previously on Fringe ... They 've done experiments on me . Agent Dunham escaped from Liberty Island . Olivia is in trouble . I 'm not sitting here . Hey , Liv ! Thank God we found you . I 'm not who you think I am . Mom ? I 'm not your daughter . My mother died when I was fourteen years old . You are , you 're just confused ! This was going to be my way home . - This is your home . - I 've never been here before ! If you 've never been here , how did you know to come here ? Why convince her she 's our Olivia Dunham ? You 'll know soon enough . Ah ! Ugh ! Oh , my gosh ! - You all right ? - You all right ? Welcome back , Agent Dunham . You do remember me , right ? Yeah . You 're that tightwad that owes me $ 70 . Damn it ! I was ... I was hoping you 'd forget about that . It 's good to see you . You too . No worse for the wear ... You look like you got some rest . A continuous I.V. drip and government-issue antipsychotics , - it 's like instant RR . - It sounds like fun . Maybe I should , uh , dive off the deep end . Hey , you think anyone would notice a difference ? You know what I realized this minute ? That I didn 't miss you at all , not even an itty , little bit . Come on , you were lost without me . - Admit it . - Yeah , yeah . How does she seem ? She seems like Olivia Dunham . For all intents and purposes , she is Agent Dunham . She 's internalized her traits , her memories , her knowledge . When tested , she consistently responds as our Agent Dunham would under similar circumstances . And what about our Agent Dunham ? Has she made contact ? She is on the other side ... focused on the task at hand . Permission to speak , Mr. Secretary . Go ahead . Putting an impostor on my team is too big a risk . Now , you can run all the tests you want , but you don 't know how this Olivia will respond in the field . We have no other choice . She needs to be completely immersed in Agent Dunham 's life . Over time , she will reach a plateau , - and her new identity will become fixed . - Well , how much time ? Because I 'm not willing to lose one of my legitimate agents . You don 't know what we have to gain . Which is what , exactly ? Sit down . She can move between worlds . We have discovered some ways to cross over . But each comes with their own dangerous consequences . But she ... She can cross without harm . The Science Division is working up a series of experiments . We need her to submit willingly , which she 'll only do if she believes that she belongs here . Phillip ... If we can learn what she already knows ... We can begin to defend ourselves . And what if her new identity doesn 't hold ? Then she 'll no longer be necessary . - Keep me apprised . - Yes , sir . Yesterday a Liberty Metro bus ran a red light , killing a person . This morning same thing happened again . Two mornings in a row , two buses kill two people . Now , lookers ran the probabilities , and it 's a statistical anomaly . What happened at yesterday 's crash ? Police considered it a routine accident , so we have no more information . - You mind taking over ? - Sure . Okay ... The first victim 's name is Cole Arnett , 43 years old . He was on his way to his job . He is a hospital case worker . Must 've been his unlucky day . All right , we 're coming in . Oxygen , people . Air quality normal , no oxygen needed . Okay , listen up . Agent Lee will be meeting us on the site . He 'll be calling the shots . Agent Francis . Watch the time , Agent Lee . I need you back in that chamber in eight hours , or your burns will regress . - You can kiss all that healing good-bye . - Easy come , easy go . - Oh , you think you 're amusing . - I am amusing ! - God , I miss this . - I bet . Did , uh , Broyles download you yet ? Talked to him on the way over . I need a victim I.D. See what I can do . - Where 's my ... - Field kit ? Here . You look better . You look sane . - You doing all right ? - So far . I mean , it 's my first day back , so ... Listen , when I pulled that gun on you , I didn 't know what I was doing . - If something had happened ... - But nothing happened . You and I , we 're good . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Died on impact . No attempts to revive her were made . Obviously . Still have any fingerprints ? Right hand 's probably your best bet . Real name 's Jillian Foster , 32 . Lives right here in Hoboken . Anything else ? She liked daisies . I never hit a person before , never . I mean , once , I hit a pigeon . I felt horrible for weeks . No sign of environmental degradation . Molecular cohesion is intact . So why is this a Fringe case ? Yeah , yeah . We 're done . Thanks . What , you got something ? When 's the last time you saw one of these ? God , a pen ? I don 't know . Pre-school maybe . I didn 't know they still made these . It 's obviously new . - No dents , no scratches . - Where 'd you find it ? Right there , by the mailbox . Oh , that 's where the bike messenger said he swerved , so he wouldn 't hit some old guy that was bending down . Huh . Uh , you want to share , buddy ? Or are we supposed to stand here and watch you think ? All right ... It 's pretty rare finding one of these just lying around . Well , maybe the old guy bent down to pick it up , and that 's what caused the bike messenger to swerve . Causing him to hit the stand . Like the pen started some kind of ... chain reaction . Did you find something ? What is it ? Sorry , I thought I recognized someone . You okay ? Yeah . All right , so ... Fringe event ... or not ? Not sure yet . But something weird definitely happened here . Yeah . Hello ? Hey , babe . You didn 't have to do that . Well ... Hey . Thank you . So how was it ? Yeah , it was ... It was pretty good . Yeah ? What 's happening in north Texas ? I heard it 's a pretty bad outbreak . 22 smallpox cases so far . Has Atlanta called ? No , no one 's assigned me yet . Oh . Wait , why are we talking about this ? Because you 're a virologist , and smallpox is one of your areas of expertise . You may as well start packing . No , I mean , why are we talking about me ? I want to talk about you . How was it being back at work ? What 's wrong ? Did something happen ? Well , at first , it was normal . And then we 're out in the field , and ... And ... I saw a face . - A face ? - Mm . Was it someone you know ? Do you remember the Secretary 's son ... The one who was kidnapped when he was a boy ? - Mm-hmm . - Yeah , him . But it wasn 't really him . It was ... It was like I was hallucinating or something . - Did you tell Broyles ? - No . Maybe you shouldn 't be on field duty . Yeah , I want to be there . I know , but you have to tell someone ... A doctor , at least . I need my life back , Frank . And I love your gung-ho attitude , but , honey , you just got over a breakdown . If you need help , that 's fine . Frank , it was my first day back . I was nervous . I don 't think that it 's that surprising - that there 's a trace ... - I can take myself off call . - Maybe it 's not a good time to travel . - That 's not what I want . Are those avocados ? Where did you get them ? - How much ? - Don 't worry about that . - Liv , what if it happens again ? - It won 't . But if it does , you 'll tell Broyles , right ? Because ... I love you . I 'll tell him . Thank you . - Can we eat ? - Yes , we can eat . - Okay . - Okay . All right . Help me out here . So the first bus driver was distracted by tree trimmers when he ran the red light . The second bus driver was looking at a fight over oranges . Isn 't distraction the root of every accident ? Listen , I 'm not finding any connections in these victims ' bios either . The first guy , Arnett , worked at a hospital for the past fifteen years . The second victim , Ms. Foster , landed her position at Gregston Electric a little over a year ago . Maybe they knew someone in common ? Or maybe , despite what Farnsworth said , it 's just ... two freak accidents . You know , Liv thinks I 'm right ... about there being chain reactions that led up to the crashes . Okay . Well , now that you two have , uh , rediscovered your Vulcan mind meld ... Do you think she 's doing okay ? Yeah . Why , you don 't think so ? I don 't know . I just ... I just feel a little uncomfortable . That 's not a shocker . You let a doppelganger coldcock you with a bottle because you didn 't pick up on the fact - that she wasn 't your partner . - And you would have ? I just know Liv a little better , that 's all . Right . 'cause you ... You kissed her one time . How was I supposed to know she had a boyfriend ? - Okay . - Whatever . The point is , I would 've known . Yeah , keep telling yourself that , okay ? When she was having her breakdown , she kept on and on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else , that this wasn 't her life . This is gonna sound nuts . What if she 's telling the truth ? What if it 's not the real her ? That is nuts . You 're right . All right . For the record , you cannot tell those two apart . Look at this ... Over there on the ground , the lower corner . That 's another ballpoint pen . Get Liv , tell her we got something . Someone is causing these accidents on purpose . How is that even possible ? I mean , what would be the odds ? 0.000 ... Impossible . Astrid , we see impossible every day . You see improbable . You 're asking me if it is possible for a person to use a ballpoint pen to set off a chain of events that culminates in someone getting killed by a bus twice ? Exactly . There 's no way . Yeah , but given how few ballpoint pens are out there , finding one at both crime scenes ... I mean , that 's an anomaly . You said that yourself . - What if someone calculated the variables ? - 37 people in the intersection , 22 cars , 4 trucks , 2 buses , Wind speeds of five to ten miles an hour , and that is just to start . In total , we are talking about 120 variables in a dynamic system of differential equations . I can 't solve that kind of a problem , much less manipulate the outcome to my advantage . So there 's not even the slightest chance we 're dealing with a murderer ? Dude , seriously ? What part of 0.000 don 't you get ? What is it ? It happened again . What did ? Bus accident , East 85th and York . - Have you called the ambulance ? - It 's on the way . Sir , we 're gonna get you to the hospital . Where were you sitting on the bus ? Right in the front , first seat . - Did you happen to notice a pen ? - What ? A ... A pen . A ... A ballpoint pen . You use it to ... to write with . Looks like there was some sort of commotion . Dog ran into the street , distracted a bus driver . There is no way this is another coincidence . Except this time it didn 't work . He 's gonna make it . Uh , ma 'am , you need to stay still . It 's not over . He 's still here ! Stop ! Don 't move ! Take your hands out of your pockets . Put your hands on your head . Whoa ! Give Astrid his physical description . Have her run it through the database . I did . She 's already working on it . - Okay . - You got to get back in that pod . It 's just the two-minute warning . Agent Lee , what part of be " back in eight hours " didn 't you understand ? You know , I ... I still can 't believe that he knew the bike would cause the truck to slow down and swerve under the footbridge . I mean , he didn 't even look . How did he know precisely when to jump ? You should stop focusing on how and focus on why . Why is he targeting these people ? All right , I 'm working on it . The victims must have something in common . There 's got to be a connection we 're not seeing . Oh , God . Okay , Lincoln , you got to get in there . Cross-check their medical files , criminal records , job histories , tax histories ... - Shut up , okay ? I got it . - Someone 's gotten bossy . Where have you been ? They 've been calling all day . What did you tell them ? Nothing . You have to call them back . Each liquefied thing provides an instance of the property of being liquid . Liquid and mass is equal . Passing through liquid and mass is the same . If you don 't call them , I will . But you won 't . You see , your only action will be inaction . That 's your pattern . What ? 97 % of your actions prioritize relational bonds over other variables . Eight out of nine times , you avoid making decisions that could result in a negative outcome . I am not some collection of data you need to make sense of . I 'm your sister . I 'm worried about you . Can 't you see that ? - All I want is for you to ... - Is for you to be safe . That 's all I 've ever wanted for you . - Go again . - Stop finishing my sentences , and let me help you . Trust me , Milo , I 've always been there for you . I 've always taken care of you . That was fun . Don 't . I ... Don 't . Don 't . You didn 't expect that , did you ? Because you 've forgotten what it 's like to feel emotions . No , no . You 've forgotten us . Mom gave you this as a reminder ... No . That you didn 't have to do more than you were able to , that we loved you . - That 's irrelevant now . - Milo , please ! I don 't recognize you anymore . I made a mistake when I signed you up . I didn 't mean this . You have to follow the rules . You have to do what they say . You 're overreaching . Remember this . Look , listen . What time is your mommy gonna be home ? No , no , no , no , no , no , no . I don 't want to hear you play your flute , kid . I 'm gonna call you back . You just hung up on a child . You talk to the next witness . I hope it 's a tuba player , okay ? Fine . Uh , this is Agent Dunham , can you connect me to the next witness , please ? Excuse me ? - Hey , Charlie ... - Yeah ? Since when do we need a code ? They upgraded the system last month . You don 't remember ? Sorry . I guess I 'm still getting over the head trauma . - Hey , Liv . - Yeah ? You remember that time when we were in Coney Island ? We were riding the Hellhole together , right ? You got sick , and you threw up on the guy next to you . Yeah ... Except you threw up all over the person next to you , so you can stop trying to rewrite history . What ... What made you think of that ? - Witness is from Coney . - Oh . Hey , wait a sec ... Jillian Foster was a consultant for Gregston Electric . I don 't see the connection . - The first victim worked at Bryant Hospital , right ? - Yeah , Cole Arnett . They mainly deal with neurological disorders , Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , PTSD ... Top-flight medical research . Okay , it says here that Gregston Electric owns a subsidiary company called the Ivon Medical Group . The Ivon Medical Group is also listed as one of Bryant Hospital 's outside vendors . You 're driving . As hospitals go , not bad . Yeah , unless it 's run by an evil genius who 's creating accidents to kill people . - Good morning . - Welcome to Bryant . What can I do for you ? Agent Francis , Agent Dunham . We 're here to see your chief medical director . Hold on , I 'll let him know . Hi , Violet . Could you let Dr. Levin know Fringe agents are here ? It 'll just be a minute . Are we being quarantined ? No . Scout 's honor . Are you seeing what I 'm seeing ? Right there on the table . We 're definitely in the right place . So sorry for the delay . I 'm Dr. Levin . Agent Francis . Uh , Agent Dunham . Hi . Please , my office is right this way . Doctor , we just noticed that a lot of your patients are using ballpoint pens . Well , many of our residents have trouble interfacing digitally due to their mental deficiencies . Pen and paper is just a ... Well , an easier way to communicate . Did you know Mr. Arnett well ? We didn 't socialize outside of work , but , uh , well , we were all devastated when we heard . - What about this woman ? - Yes , Jillian Foster . She , uh , worked with the Ivon Medical Group . They were , uh , conducting a drug trial here . You 're kidding me . Jeffrey Mayer ? You know him ? Yes . But I , uh ... I don 't understand . He was killed too ? Doctor , we 're gonna have to question all your science and medical personnel on staff . You 're not looking for a doctor . You 're looking for a patient . We started this study a year ago . We were working on creating nootropics . - Like smart drugs . - That 's right . All of our test subjects started with an I.Q. of less than 65 . Our aim was to increase their intelligence . So they could function independently - day to day . - That 's a worthy goal . We thought so too . Oh , st ... Ca ... Can you go back ? Stop . That 's him . Milo Stanfield . You don 't sound surprised . I 'm not . This was Milo five months ago ... Measured I.Q. of 56 , severe cognitive deficiency . He 's reciting the digits of pi . To 1,000 decimal places , while solving differential equations in his head . That is unbelievable . That was after one treatment . We gave him five . Every time we administered the protocol , his intelligence increased exponentially . The final phase of the project allows subjects to be released under the supervision of a guardian 's care . And after that ? After that , we return the subjects to their original state . A necessary part of human drug trials . We had to determine whether the are any permanent adverse side effects . So Milo didn 't want to be regressed , which is why he went after Cole Arnett . We thought it was an accident . I drove to Ivon and informed Jillian myself . She was concerned that the delay in regressing Milo might compromise the results . She offered to handle it herself . So Milo killed her too . So what about the third victim ? - Jeffrey Mayer ? - A recovery specialist , who we contract with if somebody goes missing . The thing is ... I only put the order in yesterday . Mr. Mayer had not yet been assigned the task . Okay , so who 's Milo 's guardian ? Uh , his sister . She lives out on Long Island ... Oyster Bay , I believe . You really think he 'd go back there ? He 's got to know that 's the first place people are gonna look . I 've been to Oyster Bay . I never saw an oyster . I can 't wait to tell Lincoln he was right , that this guy is actually able to start a chain reaction to commit murder . I 'm not watching the happy dance . - Can I help you ? - Fringe Division . We need to ask you a few questions . - Uh , about ? - About your brother , Milo . Three people ? That we know of , yeah . No , there must be some mistake . Milo wouldn 't kill innocent people . I suppose he didn 't think they were that innocent . You know , after all , they were trying to cut off the medication that was making him smart . Right ? Do you have any idea where he is now ? He doesn 't confide in me anymore . You mind if I take a look at his room ? Go ahead ... Last door on the left . Is that you ? Mm-hmm . " Milo and Madeline " ... Sounds like a kids ' book . You 're not the first person to say that . Ah , you seem close . We were . He was a lot older , but ... we liked the same cartoons , played the same games . I had the opposite . My sister and I were close in age , but ... we fought over everything . Are you close now ? Uh , she passed a few years ago . Oh , I 'm sorry . That must 've been ... - really difficult . - It was . When I was little , I used to always be scared that something would happen to Milo . He 'd forget to check for cars , just run right into traffic . I worried that he 'd never be happy . He 'd never feel like ... Like he belonged . Must 've been hard watching him struggle . It was harder for him . That 's why I agreed to the drug study . He isn 't that helpless person anymore . He 's dangerous , and I think you know that . So if there is anything that you can think of ... We just don 't want to see anyone else get hurt , including your brother . It 's a ... It 's a good-bye note . But it says where I can reach him . Thank you . Patricia Hotel , Lakewood Avenue . Yeah , I 'm gonna call backup , - get them to meet us there . - Hold on a second . What if that 's what Milo wants ? You know , that 's his M.O. , always ten steps ahead . So what , you think he knew that his sister was gonna tell us ? Listen , he knows we 're onto him . He knows his sister . What if he 's trying to set us up ? Well , we can 't just stand here . I can 't answer that . Why not ? Because there is no answer . It 's a mathematical problem without a solution . Well , which scenario is more likely ? We go to the Patricia hotel , or we don 't ? Suppose he predicts you 'll go there . But then you 'll predict he 'll predict that , - so you don 't go . - So we shouldn 't go ? But then he predicts that you predicted that . And he changes his plan , which means that you should go to the hotel . But then he predicts that you 'll predict what he predicted too . It 's an infinite spiral . Okay , well , thank you , Astrid . We 'll take it from here . - Where you going ? - To the Patricia Hotel . - Liv ... - Look , Charlie , he could be there now . I 'm not willing to lose him . Are you ? Fine . You drive . Charlie , there he is . Oh , that wasn 't supposed to happen . Freeze ! Here . Take it . Take it . Press the button . You move again ... The next one won 't be in your leg , buddy . That 's it . You 're okay . Just breathe . Since when do you break protocol ? You passed by an auburn diamond , okay ? Blinking auburn diamond , which you ignored . - " Compromised air quality . " - Pressure 's normal . - Thank you . - Yep . You need oxygen to breathe . Charlie , I 'm sorry . I don 't really even know why I did that . Because you 're a daredevil . I get it . So if you don 't mind ... I 'd appreciate it if we don 't go through this again ? Okay . The drugs have been in his system too long , so the doctors weren 't able to reverse the effects . According to the doctors , the patterns that he sees are too complex to put into words . His thoughts now can only be interpreted by a machine . So ... So the machine is talking to him ? Madeline , your brother ... He no longer thinks in terms that you or I would be able to comprehend . I 'm sorry . ... is equal value of six . Six is the solution . What is a solution ? Derives a gradient of " Y. " Evaluate a why for and proceed . Isolate discontinuities and recalibrate . There 's a 42 % chance that the king will take the queen . You know , sometimes I envy you , Brandon ... Being here , nothing to distract you . Mr. Secretary , I didn 't realize you were coming . - These are my son 's clothes . - Yes . I thought if I used items from the other side , it would provide an associative link which would spark Olivia to ... Cross over to the other universe . Yes , good thinking . When will it be ready ? We 're very close . So far , all the test subjects I 've hooked up to the chair ... They 're experiencing a high level of anxiety , their stress is causing my readings to fluctuate . I 've been tinkering with this thing all day . The solution is obvious ... Submerge the subject in water . Sensory-deprivation tank . Of course . The womb-like atmosphere naturally provides a state of relaxation . Sometimes simpler is better . Do you miss it ? Miss what ? Being a scientist . I am still a scientist , Brandon . I just have a much larger laboratory . Let me know as soon as the tank 's ready . God , I don 't know how you do it . I 'm never done packing till the cab actually arrives . Well , I 'm off to deal with diseased people in north Texas , so it 's not like I have to look good . Oh , except you do . Are you sure you 're okay with me doing this ? I can still call Fiken , beg him to cover for me . We have had this conversation . I know . I know . It 's just they haven 't told me yet - how long I 'll be gone . - So just keep me posted . That 's probably the cab . You know why you didn 't die today , right ? Because you didn 't know the protocol . If you 'd stopped for oxygen , you 'd be dead right now . But you did something that he couldn 't factor in . You kept running . You know why you did that . It 's the same reason you thought you saw Walter in the hospital . It 's the same reason why you think you 're seeing me now . You 're not from this world , Olivia . You 're not her . You 're not real . Real is just a matter of perception . I am here . And I 'm a part of you that you have to hold onto . You can 't forget who you are , Olivia . You can 't forget where you 're from . You can 't forget this . What 's wrong ? Nothing . You just surprised me , that 's all . You all right ? Yeah . It 's just I 'm gonna miss you . I 'm gonna miss you too . - I will be home as soon as I can . - Okay . You call me when you land . All right . Bye .

 My name is Anna . We are of peace , always . Nothing can take away from the excitement as we open our doors to a nation from beyond our imagination . They 're calling themselves " the Visitors . " The Visitors didn 't just get here . They 've been here for years . They 've disguised their appearance by cloning human flesh over their own reptilian skin . They 'll take over unless we can stop them . My partner was one of them . Anyone could be a Visitor . - They are animals . - No , not all of them . There 's others out there like me . They 're called the Fifth Column . We 'll help . It is really important to me that you don 't get involved with the Visitors . I joined the peace ambassadors . If my mom knew , she 'd go ballistic . Tyler 's the one . You should use him . You 're doing an excellent job . - Thank you , mother . - Bring him up to the ship . Tell him I wanna meet him . There are hundreds of images being captured by the damn jackets . Why don 't they just annihilate us and get it over with ? They need us for something . We want to provide complete medical services to all . Mr. Decker , may we have a word before you go ? - You think I 'm gonna die ? - The good news is we can heal you . - We 've developed a vitamin supplement . - R-6 . It 's what they 're putting in their vitamin shot . This is part of something much bigger . Keep this as evidence . The rest we destroy . The warehouse containing all of the R-6 compound has been lost . We have to stop this now . I got some news today . I 'm pregnant . Who are you ? How 'd you get in here ? - Where am I ? - It 's okay , Jack . You 're at the V healing center . You 're in good hands . Hey , this is Brandon . Leave a message . It 's Tyler 's mom . He 's ... he 's not answering my calls . I know he 's on the V ship . I 've been calling all night . Call me back , please . Aah ! Aah ! Nice try . Stings like hell , but my heart 's on the other side . Aah . I bet that stings like hell , too . Wow , someone 's hungry . Guess you 're eating for two now , right ? More like ten . This is my third omelet . I don 't think my appetite 's normal . I 'm only six weeks . Most women tend to lose their appetites - in the first trimester . - You really gotta go easy , okay ? - This isn 't your average pregnancy . - What do you mean ? I 'm talking about your heart condition . Yeah , sweetheart , we really need to be careful with that . - Ohh . - What ? What ? What ? I ... I think I just felt the baby move . How is that possible ? Let me see . No , I don 't feel anything . But listen , let 's just get you to come over and sit down . I want you to sit down and slow down . We 've hardly had any time to get used to all this , - but I 'm sure everything is gonna be fine , okay ? - Yeah . - All right . Just relax . - Yeah , you 're right . Anyway , the O.B. will explain everything - next week ? - That was fast . Yeah , I was nervous , so I had the appointment pushed up . All our questions will be answered then . - Yeah ? - It 's Erica . I 've just been attacked . They have my son . This is the guard from the v warehouse we torched . Well , he was . I 've been trying to call Jack . No word . You heard from him yet ? No , but Georgie 's looking . How do we know that they 're not out there right now searching for him ? - He acted alone . Everything he ever knew about us ends here . - How do you know ? - Because I know Anna . We infiltrated a warehouse he was guarding , blew it up right under his nose . You make a mistake like that , you clean it up before you report back to her . And he figured he would suffer a better fate at my hand than hers ? He was wrong . What are you doing ? My son is on that ship . - I 'm going to get him back . - You can 't just go storming up to the ship , Erica . Ryan , that bastard came into my home and tried to kill me , and now my son is up there with the rest of them . Don 't tell me what I can 't do . We make the wrong move here , Erica , your son will have no one to come home to . I 'm trying to help . You want to help ? Lose the body . His mother keeps calling . She 's worried about him . Keep him here till we find what we need . He can only have one family ... Us . Yes , mother . I 'm not saying this again . I need to see my son . - All right , I 'm no longer asking . - Agent Evans ? I need to see my son . Tyler ? This way , please . Tyler , come on . We 're leaving . Come on . No , mom . I 'm not . Look , I know I was out all night , and I should have called you , and I 'm really sorry , but ... I don 't want to go home , not right now . Ty , I need you to come home now . Why ? I 'm safe . I 'm ... I 'm fine . What , is it because you don 't trust the V 's ? I just don 't understand what your problem is with them . My only problem is that you stayed out all night , and you didn 't call . I was worried . Something could have happened to you . What , you think just because you 're 17 I don 't worry anymore ? Look , I 'm not a kid anymore , and you 've got to stop treating me like one . Don 't worry . I 'm ... I 'm fine . I 'll be home for dinner . Tyler ... Your son is still on board our ship . He refused to come down , so you were speaking to a hologram of him . Don 't worry , Agent Evans . As long as your son is a guest our ship , you have nothing to fear . This is Chad Decker with a " Prime Focus " special report . An apparent attack on a Lyndhurst shipping warehouse has destroyed most of New York City 's flu vaccines . The FBI has no suspects at this time , but rumors are swirling it may have been a terrorist attack . There are even some anti-V activists claiming the Visitors were involved . We 'll have more details as they become available to us throughout the day . We have nothing to worry about . Our fail-safe incinerated everything inside . There 's nothing left to lead them back to us . Even your mouthpiece Chad Decker can 't hurt us . I 'll handle him . Where do we stand with our own investigation ? No leads . Our surveillance footage was erased before the Fifth Column sent their message and destroyed our warehouse full of R-6 . Find who did this and supply the FBI with a lead . Deliver a villain , and a hero emerges . The resistance is growing . If the Fifth Column is in our midst , there may be others on ships worldwide . We have to crush them before they become a greater threat . To do that , we need more soldiers ... an army . You only brought a few on these ships . The fleet you sent for is still on its way . You 'll get your army . How ? I 'll make one . I need to get on that ship and get my son . You do that , and he 's dead . Anna knows that you 're an FBI agent . There is no way she 's gonna risk a diplomatic incident by hurting Tyler . There is nothing that we can do about it right now . You need to go to work and stay as close to that warehouse investigation as you can , make sure it doesn 't lead back to us . Any word from Jack ? Georgie 's still looking for him . What are you gonna do ? I 'll take a sample of that R-6 that we got from the warehouse to a V doctor I know , see if we can figure out what 's in that flu vaccine . Find Jack , okay ? No . No ! Please , no . Long time , Dr. Pearlman . Ryan . What are you doing here ? I need your help . What 's this ? R-6 . The V 's are putting that into the human flu vaccine . Thought you 'd help me find out why . That 's not the only reason I 'm here . My girlfriend val ... She 's pregnant . Are you sure ? They told us that we could not procreate with humans . This is the first I 've ever heard of this happening . I ... I guess nature and fate - they find a way . She has this heart condition , though , and I don 't even know if she could handle a regular pregnancy , let alone something like this . Does she know the truth about you ? I 'm afraid what it 'll do to her ... and us ... If she ever found out . Imagine what would happen if Anna ever found out about this . You ... Your girlfriend ... Your child ... Will never be safe . The captains of the 29 ships are sending their best soldiers to us . They 're to report to you for a full medical examination before I meet them . As you wish . Where do we stand with the R-6 ? All the doses that we hid in the human flu vaccines were destroyed by the explosion . There 's still plenty of R-6 in our healing centers . Continue to administer it to the humans there . Many of them are too afraid to go into the healing centers . They don 't trust us yet . Then we 'll get them to trust us . W ? By using somebody they already do . Paging Dr. Bedford . Dr. Bedford . Good news , Chad . Your C.T. scan showed no sign of a basilar artery aneurysm . Well , the V scan says that I 'm going to develop one . All I can tell you is that the most advanced human technology doesn 't indicate that there 's a problem . Well , what if they 're right ? What if I do develop one ? Well , unfortunately , that type of aneurysm is inoperable . So there wouldn 't be anything we can do for you anyway . - So I should let the V 's heal me ? - Chad , as a doctor , I can only recommend what I know to be medically possible . - And as a friend ? We don 't know the long-term effects of the Visitors ' healing methods . So you can either trust our medicine or theirs . Excuse me . Yes , can I help you ? Yeah . I 'm looking for father Jack . You 're thinking of joining the parish ? No , not ... not exactly . Listen , I ... I need to find him . It 's important . I 'm afraid there 's been an accident . Jack was stabbed late last evening . What ? Who ? We don 't know yet , but it 's a miracle he 's alive . - Okay . What hospital is he in ? - Not a hospital . The V healing center . I took him where I knew he would be saved . Any news on the warehouse explosion ? C.S.U. Found nothing . Whatever hit that place burned so hot there was nothing left to analyze . Malik ! What does Malik have to do with the warehouse explosion ? Well , as head of the Visitor joint task force , she 's been brought in to the investigation . The Visitors offered to assist us . How ? They got an alien k-9 unit we 're not aware of ? Apparently , they have a device that can show us who did this . Agent Evans ? Nice to see you again . I 'm sorry about this morning . So am I. Tyler is doing fine . And with respect to the warehouse , I want to assure you that whoever committed this heinous act ... we will catch them . Our technology can measure ordnance fragmentation , chemical composition and projective last pattern . Together , it calculates and creates a simulation of the explosion . There 's your explosive ... c4 plastic compound , magnesium fuse . 600-foot blast radius . Now that I told you the how , would you like to know the who ? Wow . Those are ... prints . We got a match . Prints belong to ... Kyle Hobbes . Who 's Kyle Hobbes ? He 's a mercenary at the head of pretty much every law enforcement agency 's - most wanted list . - Yeah . Former British SAS , improvised weapons expert ... guerrilla warfare , black ops . He 's the guy countries would send in to train the rebels when they needed a convenient uprising . That was before he became a gun for hire ... whoever would pay him most . No one 's had anything solid to pin on him till now . If this pans out , it 's a big win for us . I 'll report back to Anna . This will please her greatly to know she 's helped you . All right , listen up , everybody . Hobbes is in new York . Run all informants . Work with known associates lists . We finally got something to pin on this guy . Let 's bring him in . So what 's this guy got do with us ? On paper , we don 't stand a chance against the Visitors . We are overpowered , outnumbered and under-equipped . Hobbes can train us , teach us how to think . You 're talking about recruiting him for the resistance ? I know how crazy this sounds , Ryan . Believe me . I have spent my entire career ridding the world of people like Hobbes . I am scared . My son is up there on that ship . I am helpless to protect him . Okay , say we do this , right ? How do we even find him ? Dale . Your old partner ? He spent seven years with the FBI counter-terrorist division . He was meticulous . They have his hard drive . If there 's any information about Hobbes , - that is where it will be . - You sure about this ? What if he isn 't just some patsy ? What if Anna chose him for a reason ? 'Cause he 's dangerous to her . Yeah . He has access to weapons . He could train resistance . That is exactly why we need him . The FBI took the bait . They 're looking for Kyle Hobbes . They will no longer be a problem for us . Where are we with finding the Fifth Column who are truly responsible ? Our people are looking into it . We will find them . Good . And then I 'll eviscerate them . If we cross this line , Erica , and we get into bed with a guy like Hobbes , - there is no turning back . - She has my son . If I have to cross a line to blow that bitch out of the sky , I will . That 's fugu ... Japanese blowfish . I know . It has a deadly poison in its liver . If not cut properly , it means instant death . Maybe that 's what makes it so delicious . Try it . Wow . It 's amazing . Sit . Enjoy . Thanks for joining me . I saw your piece on the warehouse explosion . Why did you mention rumors of my people being involved ? Because they 're part of the story . I was doing my job . I am a reporter . Mm . And yet you haven 't aired your story on our healing centers . It 's very important to me ... and so are you . I know about the aneurysm , Chad . I also know you haven 't signed up for treatment with us , and I 'm concerned . Thank you , but I feel fine . That 's today . What about tomorrow ? I 'm not sure I believe you can diagnose the future . This is real . Why won 't you let me help you ? Maybe because you always want something from me . And you don 't want something from me ? Run the piece on the healing centers . And what if I don 't ? I can only imagine how scary it must be living in fear of sudden death ... And helpless to do anything about it . Mmm . It is delicious . Jack . Welcome back . It 's okay . You 're healed . No . No . There 's ... something 's wrong with me . They injected me with R-6 . I can ... I can feel it inside me . No . No ! Aah ! Jack , it 's okay . It 's me . Georgie ? How 'd you find me ? Father Travis said he brought you here for your own good . Where 's everyone else ? I 'll explain later . Now get dressed . We need to get out of here . Evans . You find anything on Hobbes ? You 'll be the first to know . Great . Hey , Kyle . What are you smiling about ? That she didn 't come alone . Who are you ? Your only chance for a future . How 'd you find me ? My old partner kept files on people like you . He also didn 't like to share them with the FBI . - Well , who 'd he share them with ? - The same people who set you up . - Set me up ? How ? - Your prints ... on the bomb that torched the Lyndhurst warehouse . If I had anything to do with that , they wouldn 't have my prints . And since I didn 't , they don 't . - They do . - Prove it , or the three of us get to play " who 's got the best aim ? " Trust me , not a game you want to play . - Kendrick . - Paul , it 's Erica . I 'm following up a lead from Dale 's hard drive ... a tip on the location for Hobbes . 40 Ellridge . He 's there right now . - On my way . - I 'll meet you there . Any minute n , the FBI SWAT team will come through that door . You can either come with us or leave with them . Make up your mind . We only came here for help . My kind of help costs , and you 're living on a fed 's salary . That sounds like a raw deal for me . We can get you money . - We can also get you something more valuable . - What ? The people who framed you . Aren 't you curious ? You have one minute . Your choice . Where is he ? We just missed him . Cigar 's still lit . There 's another door . Escape route . Where 's Hobbes ? Gone . Somebody tipped him off . Did you find what we 're looking for ? There 's just so much . What does it all mean ? They don 't seem to serve any purpose . Human memories contain emotion , not just information . That 's why they can be difficult to interpret . Why aren 't our memories like that ? Our species is designed for efficiency . We 're not burdened by emotional imprints like humans . We have what we need . Tyler must calm her fears , loosen her bond on him . And he will be free from her . And you , my daughter , will be free to fulfill your destiny . That was amazing . We call it a memory chamber . But it felt like I was really there . We tapped into your cerebral cortex , allowing you to relive your memories in vivid detail . It affected you . I saw my family , a long time ago . You know what I saw ? I saw a mother afraid of losing her son . Go home . Tell her it 's okay to let you go , not to be afraid . You 're becoming a man , starting your own life . That doesn 't mean she 'll lose you like she did your father . - You 're becoming a man ... - Erica . Hey . You okay ? Yeah . You ? Yeah . Thank you , Georgie . This is Hobbes . He 's ex-military , gun for hire , weapons expert . - He can get us weapons . He can teach us to fight . - Is he a terrorist ? - He 's only loyal to money . - That makes him predictable . - Yeah , and if someone comes along and pays him more than we do ? - Anna is fighting dirty . If we want to win this war , - we can 't bring knives to a gunfight . - You 're forgetting one thing . I haven 't said yes yet . Have you looked in the sky lately ? They 're here to annihilate us . Unless you got deep pockets , I 'm not interested in your cause . This isn 't just a cause for us . It 's his way of life . It 's my faith . Revenge for a family slaughtered , her son . We all have a stake in this . Don 't think you don 't . Go ahead and walk away . We still have your prints on that bomb . And you 're trying to hire me , a known fugitive , to do your bidding . Yeah . You have as much to lose now as I do . So last time-show me the money or show me the door . You 're right . Like it or not , we 're all in this together now . So how about I show you the truth ? The V 's are nothing but lies . They look like you . They sound like you . But we are not like you . So you 're telling me ... Yeah . I 'm one of them . But I am not with them . And they 're the ones that framed you . Aren 't you the least bit pissed off and curious why ? Yeah . Welcome to the war . Hey , mom . It 's Ty . On my way home from the ship now . I 'll , uh , see you at dinner . Okay . Bye . Hey . Georgie told me what happened . I got the guy who stabbed you . He 's a pair of lizard skin boots now . How 's Tyler ? Okay . He 's coming home for dinner . That 's ... that 's good . How are you ? I 'm ... I 'm fine . You lying to me , father ? I feel like something 's changed inside me . We 're all changing . I just made a deal ... With the devil . I broke every oath that I have sworn to protect . I don 't know what I 'm thinking . You 're thinking about protecting your son , the ones you love . Hey . It 's good to see a friend . Me , too . So what did you find out ? Examination of the R-6 using human technology revealed nothing more than a simple saline shot . But when I used our equipment , I found something quite different . R-6 has a molecular compound that embeds itself in human DNA . It interacts with the human genome , then emits a wavelength of sorts , like a transmission . So she 's tagging humans like animals in the wild . You tell anybody about this ? No . And neither should you . Not until we know the truth . How are the candidates for the next phase of the R-6 plan looking ? I think she 'll be pleased . I 'm Chad Decker , reporting live from the Manhattan Visitor healing center . Miracle cures ? Wonder drugs ? Tonight " Prime Focus " takes you inside the V healing centers , where science fiction is becoming science fact for those in need , for those like me . During my visit here for this report , the V doctors diagnosed me with a lethal Brian aneurysm . They 're telling me they have a cure , and I 'm gonna take it . " Prime focus " will take its cameras behind the curtains as I am healed by the Visitor doctors , giving all of you a firsthand look at their miracle cures . What is it ? Mr. Decker just made sure we 'd take very good care of him . Kyle Hobbes escaped the FBI . We suspect he was tipped off . Fifth Column ? Perhaps . He can help them build an army against us . It 's time to build our own . You have been selected from the best among the 29 ships . Our army will begin with one of you . The very survival of our species will depend on one of you . Your queen commands it . Him . - Mom ? - Hey . Thank God you 're home . Are you okay ? Yeah . Are you ? Do you have any idea what you put me through today ? Yes . And I 'm ... I 'm sorry . But ... I ... I need to tell you something . I ... Just ... just listen to me for once , mom . Okay . You 're not gonna lose me . I 'm not dad . I am always gonna be here for you . Just because I 'm grown up ... It doesn 't mean we gotta grow apart . How can I expect you to understand my choices if I can 't be completely honest with you ? About what ? The Visitors . - Tyler , I need to talk to you about the Visitors . - No . - There 's something I have to tell you . - Mom , listen . - It 's very , very ... - I ... I joined the peace ambassadors . You don 't have to be afraid of the V 's anymore . I 'm not afraid of the Visitors , Ty . I 'm just afraid of losing you . You won 't . Trust me . I do trust you . No more secrets about the Visitors , okay ? Don 't worry . Mom , the Visitors ... they don 't have any secrets . Ugh . Ugh . Val ? Val ? Everything okay ? Something 's not right . What do you mean ? I ... I 've been eating nonstop all day long , and I 've had weird cravings . Something 's not right . I never told you this , but I always wanted kids . And then I met you , and you told me that it wasn 't a possibility for you . And then I realized that if there was anything in the world - that I wanted more than being a mom , it was to be with you . - Val ... No , let me finish . It 's a miracle , this baby , Ryan . It happened for a reason . I know it did . It 's done . My army is to be born . Now my eggs need nourishment .

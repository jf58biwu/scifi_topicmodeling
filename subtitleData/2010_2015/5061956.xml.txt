 Previously on V ... I wanna be sure , father , that this is the right thing to do . It 's time to fight . 5th Column is proving to be a bigger threat than anticipated . We have the weapon to fight them . Ryan Nichols . - What makes you can control him ? - We have his child . She 's sick , Ryan . I can ease her suffering . All you have to do is join us again . Thank you , Agent Malik . The queen will be pleased . I think that FBI Agent Erica Evans , is in danger . You 're out of options . Come on . Come on . Come on ! Are you okay ? How did you find me ? I knew you were tracking our leads . We saw the wreckage from the road . Look at me . Look at me . - What happened ? - Malik 's a Visitor . I 'll be damned . Let me help you . You all right ? You okay ? I 'm fine . Do not kill her ! Keep her alive . We need answers . Anything and everything she knows about Anna 's plans . Take her back to your place . I 'll meet you there . - Wait , Erica . What about you ? - I gotta call this in . - What are you doing ? - Giving you a cover story . Get her into the truck . Don 't be alarmed , Lisa . Mother , what 's happening to me ? Your body is preparing you for your birthright to be queen . My skin ... it 's moving . It 's your breeding skin . It 's begun to grow . Over the next few months , as it forms , you 'll become fertile . You 'll undergo many changes ... Changes that will permit our race to endure . What kind of changes ? The emergence of your true nature ... your primal instinct . It happened to me , and my mother helped me through it . And before she died , I promised her that I would mold you into a great leader . How will I know if I 'm ready ? I 'll teach you to lead in my own image . You 'll become just like me . Lisa 's breeding skin has begun to grow . Everything 's right on schedule . So you 've come to gloat . Her fertility will ensure our survival . And yet you 're concerned . What would I have to be concerned about ? The warning I gave you about Lisa 's betrayal . I can see it on your face , working on you . Suspicion . Remember when your breeding skin began to grow ... That 's when you first betrayed me . You were weak . I did what I had to do to protect our species . So will Lisa , if you 're not careful . Because I 'll do for her what you never did for me ... Teach her to rule . Prepare her for what 's to come . In the meantime , daughter , watch your back . As I had to learn the hard way , the more you think you 're helping your child , the more you push them away . And you got nothing on the guys who did this ? I told you , Paul . It was dark . They were wearing masks . They pulled up next to us . They shot out the tires . The next thing I knew I was upside-down . It 's a miracle you survived . I 'm surprised those 5th Column nut jobs didn 't kill you . They took Malik , and I need to find her . - We were headed for that lead ... - Dead end . We checked the farmhouse . There 's no lead to the bombers . Go home . You 're off the case . It 's standard operating procedure , and you know it . Don 't worry . I 'll find Malik . I just received a report that Agent Malik has been abducted . The FBI suspects the 5th Column . They 've begun an investigation into her disappearance . The true nature of the work she was doing must not be exposed . Take some trackers and retrieve any evidence she may have left behind . What about the 5th Column ... and finding those who took her ? I have it under control . Look , Ryan . Your daughter 's not in pain anymore . You did it on purpose , didn 't you ? You made her sick to force me to help you . Of course not . I helped her and will continue to , as I promised . So now you want me to do my part . - What do you want ? - One of my children has gone missing . Sarita Malik . She was co-head of the FBI anti-V terrorism unit . We believe the 5th Column took her . I want you to find her and identify those responsible . It 'll take time . Bring me names by tonight . My bliss will wear off by then . I know you don 't want to see your daughter suffer , Ryan . Neither do I. What are you really saying , Sid ? Normal DNA looks like this ... And Tyler 's DNA ... looks like this . - Half the ladder 's been stripped . - How can he survive like this ? I don 't know , but he 's made it this far without symptoms or side effects . But a missing piece ? What does that mean ? The V 's wanted that space to be empty . For what ? Why empty anything out ? To put something else in . 2x03 - Laid Bair - Synchro : Grishnak , John117 , Miniben314 , Strex Trad : Strex , Eliza , TTT , malumilitari Relecture : Grishnak , TTT , Cable Les LÃ©zards They messed with my son . - They corrupted Tyler 's DNA . - What ? How do you know ? Sid confirmed it . They have done it when I was pregnant . Yeah , but wouldn 't Tyler have shown some signs , symptoms ? How 's something like this even possible ? Of course it 's not possible . Neither are giant spaceships . - Why would they do this ? - That 's what we need to find out . I can take samples from Ryan , but ... without DNA comparisons from a female V 's reproductive system , we 'll only have half the picture of what they could be planning for Tyler . I wouldn 't do that . She has fangs . And a tail , too . Females can just rip it out whenever they have to . We were following the lead on Eli Cohn . Malik decided to show me her true self . We still gonna hit that farm ? If radical 5th Column were there , they are long gone by now . You 're a traitor . Anna will make you pay for turning against her . What do you say , Erica ? Time to get some answers ? You need to understand something . They have a high threshold for pain . Now you want to torture her into talking ? There 's really only one way ... It 's to skin her . You won 't have much time . Skinning her is gonna kill her . She 'll live maybe a half hour , tops . That 's enough time . I only need one answer ... What they did to my son . You want to find out about Tyler . What makes you think she knows ? My first partner , now Malik . Two V partners can 't be a coincidence . They got close to me , they get close to Tyler . Now hold up . You told me yourself Malik was in the bureau before you were partners . Meaning what ? Her original assignment had nothing to do with you , or your son . Let 's find out what she 's been doing here all this time . My mom was attacked by 5th Column . I keep trying to help her , but she won 't let me . She 's an FBI agent . I 'm sure she can protect herself . I keep trying to warn her about this priest , but she won 't listen . I 'm listening . Tell me . Why do you think this priest is a threat ? He might be connected to the 5th Column . His anti-V sermons are all over the net . The suicide bomber { \ * who blew up the healing centers } went to his parish . You need to approach this differently . You need to help your mother if she won 't help herself . Check this out . Looks like we 're not the only ones interested in Malik . I put a lipstick camera in the tree . Trackers . They 're trying to pick up on Malik 's scent . - Marcus is with them . - Whatever Malik was working on , it 's important to Anna , and that makes it important to us . Where does she live ? Her apartment ? Kendrick 's sent agents . - They found nothing . - How do you know ? Because they wouldn 't know where or how to look . Let 's go . Nice place Malik 's got . Lots of security . Always gotta know who 's here . - What are we looking for ? - Safe box . Every sleeper has one . Ryan , check it out . This number 's been the more used . This could be it . I wondered what that was for . Contingency cash . - Look at this . - Law enforcement ID . Great Britain . We 've got Canada , Pakistan . V tech . This could come in handy . This have to do with her assignment ? This could tell us . Who are all those people ? These dates go for back years , before Malik was working with you . We 'll run the names through the database . Maybe we 'll find something to figure out what Malik was doing . We 've got visitors . Foil . I need some tinfoil . We 've gotta erase our scent . All right . Let 's do it . Thank you for coming , Chad . I 'm sorry it 's been so long since we 've spoken . I 've been busy . I know . I heard about your close call with the suicide bomber . Luckily , Agent Evans was there to stop her . What can I do for you ? As you 've experienced firsthand , despite general goodwill on the part of mankind , a few small pockets of hostility still remain . Residual skepticism from the whole red sky affair . You played God . That didn 't sit well with people , particularly people of faith . That 's why I called you here . I need your help . Do you know anything about this man ? Not much . The guy who hit the healing center was one of his parishioners . The police interviewed him , determined that he wasn 't involved . He 's local . Not much of a profile otherwise . Perhaps that should change . I 'd like for you to provide a forum for his voice to be heard . You want me to interview this guy ? Millions of people watch my show . Why would you ... give a fringe voice that kind of exposure ? I believe every voice , no matter how small , deserves to have a forum . Every point of view should be presented . Isn 't that the basis of good journalism ? You 're making a mistake . She singled you out , we know she 's got an ulterior motive . You can control the interview . You can edit it , protect me . Not if she 's got a bull 's-eye on you . Like you said , she already does . This will raise my profile . The bigger I get , the harder a target I become . I 'm not afraid of her . You should . I 'm gonna take the risk . Are you with me or not ? Whatever Malik 's assignment , we 'll find it in here . They all fell off the grid . There 's no financial activity , there 's no utilities , no current address . Are they homeless ? Runaways ? People Anna can make disappear , and no one will notice . Anna 's doing alien abductions ? As in ... If she 's abducting people here , she 's doing it all over the world . The only way that we can stop Anna is to get a step ahead of her . We need to figure out her plan . This is the key to eliminating the greatest threat to our survival ... the human soul . How is the human soul a threat ? It exerts a powerful influence over humans . If we don 't eliminate it , our plans will fail . There are commonly held notions among humans , the soul is eternal . After death , it leaves the body . This machine is engineered to locate and extract it . I 'm ready to begin trial runs . However , as test subjects will not survive the process , we 'll need more than before ... hundreds of thousands . How are you progressing ? Fortunately , despite Agent Malik 's disappearance , it appears our test subjects will still arrive on schedule . Good . You okay ? I think that deep down I wanted Malik 's assignment to be Ty , finally get some answers . If Malik won 't give us answers , maybe her body will . - With science boy on the case ... - That 'd be science man . Let me show you this . These dates in here are dated in the past . Except for this one . Sophie Allen . It 's dated today . - Those are the dates they were taken . - Then she 's next in line . If we can find Sophie , then we can stop this . We can keep Anna from taking anyone else . Who are those people ? What do you want with Sophie Allen ? How many more of them ? More than you can imagine . There 's a work address in here for her mother . To be continued . Hey , father . Your interview will make tonight 's news . I came by to see if you wanted to watch it ... No , it 's okay . Why don 't you stay for the service ? I want to address the violence of the last few days that shed the blood of innocent people at the healing center . You know , I 've spoken out against the Visitors , declaring them false gods , calling them intruders . And while I stand by these claims , we must never forget what defines us . My wife was killed in the suicide bombing . It wasn 't the V 's who killed her . It was their enemy . People like you . - I am so sorry for your loss . - What does that get me ? No amount of talk is gonna bring my wife back . Or their loved ones . Come on , stand up , please . This isn 't the time for this . Or the place . - Please , show some respect . - Respect ? People are dead because of this jerk . I understand your anger . Believe me , I do . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . I 've your wife 's blood on my hands , not them . You wanna blame someone , you blame me . You wanna fight ? You fight me . Madam ? Am I in some kind of trouble ? We 're worried your daughter . I 'm here unofficially , as a mother . You 're here about Sophie ? I have a friend who works at a counseling center . She was a regular , she 's missed her last appointments . I 'm not sure how I can help you . Sophie ran away six months ago . I haven 't seen her since . Do you have any leads ? Any addresses ? Friends ? - Phone numbers ? - She got caught up with some kids . They weren 't the best influence . I tried to talk to her , but ... You misstep and you misstep , and you realize you 're losing them , but ... it 's too late , you 've lost them already . I have a teenager . I feel that way sometimes , too . If you think of anything that might help us find her , please ... Call me . - Thanks . - Wait . You 're the first people to come and ask about her . I 've tried to find her , The police can 't help me because she 's over 18 . You 're a mother . You understand . You ? Do you have any children ? A daughter . Then you know how I feel . Help me . Please . Any luck with Sophie 's mom ? Malik is the only one with answers . - Let 's get ' em . - Skinning her will kill her . I still need her as a test subject . We 'll serve her up , carved up on a platter . No , I need her alive ! These tissue samples I 've taken , - they 're degrading incredibly fast . - It 's a defense mechanism . If we 're killed , we can 't be studied . I need more time . If she dies , any insight her body can give us about the Visitors , or Tyler , will die with her . It 's your son . It 's gotta be your call . I saw your interview . Fine work . I 'm not sure it 'll have the effect you hoped for . It 'll have the exact effect I hoped for . The world will pay attention to him . They would pay attention to this . So despite your opposition to the V 's , you don 't condone this recent rash of violence ? Correct . I 'm not a proponent of violence of any kind against anyone . And certainly not against my fellow man . You wanna fight ? You fight me . Hold on . That 's only half the story . I was there . Jack Landry calmed that crowd down . That 's not what the world is gonna see on your Internet . A duplicitous priest committing violence in a house of worship . This sort of story seems to spread rapidly . Well done . You helped expose a man who will be brought down by this violent truth . If Sophie is still out there , she 's our best chance for stopping these abductions . Erica , nobody would judge you if you picked Tyler . How can I put my kid 's life before so many others ? Sometimes you just ... gotta protect your own . One last time . Where 's Sophie ? Skin her . I know what you 're thinking , that you can stay strong , die before you tell us what we want to know . There 's two options here . Epinephrine . This 'll keep you alive . Another ten or so hours ... of good , hard fun . Or option number two , a sedative . This 'll put you right to beddy-bye , let you die peacefully . Personally , I vote ... to keep you alive . How can you do this to one of your own ? He may be a Visitor , but he is nothing like you . I promise you this ... You will never find that girl . Answers . That 's enough . Answers . Answers now . We can end this . Ed Cantrill . He poses as a driver for the Midnight Samaritan , delivering food to the homeless . That 's how he finds his victims ? Where ? New Jersey . Lonergan Farm . A shuttle ... When ? You saw the date . Tonight . My son Tyler ? What do you know about Anna 's plans for him ? Nothing . I don 't know anything else . I swear to you . Give her the sedative . Ryan , it 's the van . Freeze ! I got it . Don 't do it ! Don 't ! Help me . Help me . What 's happening ? It 's over . You 're gonna be okay . She 's been drugged . It 's a fail-safe in case she escaped . She won 't remember a thing . We 're gonna take you home . - There could be more out there . - Take her to the car . Over there . We 're still missing people . There 's nothing we can do . How 's my daughter doing ? Are you instructing her as a directed ? She 's proven to be a quick learner . We 're ready to test our first subject . Even when it makes no sense to fight , they do . Water , muscle , bone , tissue . Each will be removed from the corpus taking subject to the brink of death . What remains , the last substance in his dying breath , that should be the soul . Joshua , stop . Is something wrong ? Good . It is only one life . Nothing compared to the future of our species . You must learn that in order to be queen . Continue the experiment . No , not you , Joshua . Please , don 't . Help me . Please . Look into his eyes . Look into his soul . Now take it . Please . Don 't . You 're gonna be okay , Sophie . You 're very brave . You guys ... what happened to me ? I can 't remember anything . You were abducted , and now you 're safe . That is all that you need to know . The rest of it is just a bad dream . We promised your mother we 'd bring you home . Feels good , doesn 't it ? - We only saved one . - To that mother , one is everything . This is what we 're fighting for , to keep our children safe . We have to savor these wins . I wish I could . We 're gonna get your daughter back . - I know . - Good . 'Cause if we lose hope , we lose this fight . You wanna fight ? You fight me . It 's gone viral . Anna had me build you up so she could tear you down . I knew Anna would try manipulate my interview somehow , but this ... The guy who started the fight ... I saw his eyes . He wasn 't human . Anna must 've planted him there . I never told you it was gonna be easy . Look , maybe I can put out another piece . - Show people the truth . - No , they 've already seen what she wanted them to see . It 's okay . - I 'll weather this storm . - You 're on Anna 's radar . That is not an easy storm . Believe me , I 've been there . Maybe not . But I choose to have faith . It 's all I can rely on now . You 're a brave man , father . So are you . Despite what 's happened today , you have to stay close to her . - That 's your role . - Even if it costs you yours ? - What happens then ? - The 5th Column will hold strong , as long as we have men like you fighting with us . It 's time you met the others . It 's good to see you again , Agent Evans . How 's the 5th Column task force ? My day job . Call me Erica . Thank you for the tip on Malik . That was a very gutsy thing , - sticking your neck out . - It was the least I could do . You saved my ass from that suicide bomber . I don 't know . I don 't like this . He 's burned us before . - Give him a chance . - He 's right . I have burned you . But I 'm here to make amends . Use me . My position with Anna . I know her better than anyone . I can help . Anna only tells you what she wants you to know . You have no idea what she 's capable of . Or who she really is . This is what they look like . Anna ... looks like this underneath ? What do they want ? Why don 't they kill everybody and take over ? Because they want us . You sure you 're ready for this ? You did a wonderful thing today , capturing that footage on your cell phone . I 'm glad you told me to go . Now the world 's gonna see what a threat the Jack Landrys are , and more people like you will help us . That 's all that I want . I know . So does Lisa . You 'll continue to watch out for us . I will . Good . Please be careful . You 're not just a friend , Tyler . You 're like a son to me . Come in . What 's the matter ? What happened ? Talk to me . I can 't do this . I 'm not like you . I 'm a Visitor . Okay , you listen to me . It 's gonna be all right , okay ? Whatever it is , just tell me . Talk to me . My mother ... She 's trying to change me . She can 't change what 's inside you . I don 't have anyone to talk to . Yes , you do . You have me . I proved you wrong today , mother . I tested Lisa . She passed . As you passed all my tests ? Watch her ... Carefully . I 'm watching her every move . I tried to make you like me once , too . But you and I were always quite different . Caution was not ... has never been ... your nature . Caution may not be my strong suit , but foresight is . Good . You 're going to need it . She 's so peaceful when I give her bliss , isn 't she ? So ... What did you discover today ? I found the 5th Column . I know who took Malik .

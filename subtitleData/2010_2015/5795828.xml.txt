 Aldo Moro e 'morto . L 'ex Primo Ministro , Aldo Moro , e 'stato assassinato . ( SPEAKS ITALIAN ) II corpo e 'stato trovato con dieci proiettili , in via Michelangelo Caetani in Roma ... ( SHOUTS IN ITALIAN ) ... posso confermare che Aldo Moro , ex Primo Ministro e leader della Democrazia Cristiana , e 'stato assassinato . ( CLOCK CHIMES ) ( CLOCK CHIMES ) ( CLOCK CHIMES ) PHILIP : Jessica . - ( DISTANT DOG BARKS ) - Who 's that ? - Me . - Yeah . Who 's that ? - A frog . - What 's he got on his head ? A crown . ( WHISPERS ) Wow . ( SIGHS ) Jessica ? I need to talk to someone . Can you stay with this man ? ( JESSICA CHUCKLES ) ( HISSING IN PHILIP 'S HEAD ) I asked if you recognised this . It 's a document containing the identity of Mr Rabbit . It was sent to an Italian journalist called Mino Pecorelli . Say hello , Mino . Ciao . ( HE SIGHS ) Mino 's the man who pinned the death of Aldo Moro on the CIA for us . Mino 's with us . Aren 't you , Mino ? ( SPEAKS IN ITALIAN ) Getting this was a shock for Mino . It blew his mind , in fact . And we were ... very , very lucky it was sent to him . Weren 't we , Mino ? MILNER : Do you recognise it , Philip ? Well , you should . You fucking sent it . ( HISSING IN HIS HEAD ) I 've finished Janus . What ? - Does it work ? - ( BREATHING HARD ) It works perfectly . It 's perfect . But ... I 've made an adjustment to it . I 've changed it . What adjustment ? Milner ... I 've changed it . What have you done ? What is the adjustment ? - PHILIP : You can 't use it . - ( TAPPING ) You can never use what I 've made . ( HISSING IN PHILIP 'S HEAD ) Give me Janus by the end of the week . Or we 'll torture Jessica . ( JESSICA CHUCKLES ) ( HE GASPS ) NEWSREADER : Queues formed outside bakers ' shops throughout England and Wales , with most stores limiting customers to one loaf apiece . The Electricity Council have now drawn up their contingency plans for cuts and disconnections once the strike begins and the supplies to the power stations ... EDWARD HEATH : It has really been quite remarkable , what has been achieved in these last few weeks of the three-day week , er ... by British industry , because of all the arrangements which have been made by the unions and the employers and they ought to have full credit ... ( TV CRACKLES ) ( SWITCH CLICKING ) ( DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS ) ( ARBY WHIMPERS ) ( EASTERN EUROPEAN ACCENT ) What did you do to my Pietre ? Christ , Brosca . Not this again . - I 'm his father . Why would I ... - I take him to the doctor ! The doctor said it is shock , like trauma . What did you do to him ? Why did you do that ? He doesn 't need a shrink . You need to take your pills . I 'm not taking your pills ! You poison me . What did you do to him ? I fucking kill you ! What did you do to him ? I fucking kill you ! - ( SLAPPING ) - I really fucking kill you ! ( SHE SOBS ) Mr Carvel ? ( DOOR SHUTS ) ( CHATTERING ) ( LOW CHATTER ) MAN : And it 's so simple , it 's ... it 's almost elegant . It has the speed , it has the effectiveness , so we introduce the fungus to the gut of the mosquito . We just need a more virulent strain . - Ending the mosquito ends malaria . - ( SNORTS ) Dengue fever , yellow fever , West Nile virus . We believe - we are very close ... - It won 't work . I beg your pardon ? M anisopliae ? That 's what you 're talking about ? It won 't work . There 's poor stability in the sporulating strains . You 'll get 35 % effectiveness at best before the mosquito out-evolves it . We believe ... Besides , there are 3,500 species of mosquito . They 've been around for 100 million years . You think you can just yank them out of existence ? I mean , you do realise half the birds in the Arctic tundra will starve to death ? I mean , you have actually thought of that or are you just fucking idiots ? - And how would you cure malaria ? - Cure malaria ? Why would we want to cure malaria ? Malaria 's doing a great job . Leave malaria alone . Young man , you 're drunk . Yes , I am , and in the morning we 'll both still be cunts . Have you come here just to drink ? There 's a blackout everywhere else . It 's only held once every four years , this . The idea is to get people together who could never normally talk . Like politicians , world leaders scientists . No-one knows it exists . Is that what you are ? A scientist , then ? ( SIGHS ) Must be a good one to get into here . Must be some kind of genius to get into here . No offence . I 'm sure you 're great . But why don 't you just fuck off ? Why don 't you make me ? What 's wrong with curing malaria ? Or don 't you want to make the world a better place ? ( SNORTS ) Let me explain something to you . The sun throws a certain amount of energy onto this planet . We turn it into food , clothing , shelter , et cetera . It supports an amount of us and it took 30,000 years for that amount to become one billion . Then we found a way to use ancient sunlight , sunlight trapped in oil and coal . We started to live off that . What happened ? In just 130 years , our population doubled . The next billion took 30 years . The fourth billion has taken just 14 . So , here 's the question . What do you think is going to happen when that oil and coal runs out in , say , 100 years ? When there 's 10 billion living on a planet that can support only one ? I think we 're going to tear each other to shreds . At last . Someone with an ounce of fucking brain . Malaria ? The only disease that needs curing is us . Go on , then . Let 's throw ourselves off . PHILIP : What are you doing ? Well , if there 's no point in being alive ... All right , OK , I get it . Yeah , yeah , fine . I get what you ... Look , look ! That ... that could tip ! Please don 't do that . Please ? ( GASPS ) - Have you ever been in a genocide ? - What ? I have . ( GUESTS CHATTERING ) So , if you have some sort of answer I 'd like to hear it . - I have an answer . No-one wants to listen to me . They 're all too fucking scared . But if you come down off that table , I will tell you . ( MUSIC SOUNDTRACK DROWNS SPEECH ) BROSCA : Look , it 's a rabbit . See ? BROSCA : Do you like the rabbit ? Do you like it ? It 's fine , Brosca . He 'll grow out of it . Just a phase . He 's fine . ( MUSIC SOUNDTRACK DROWNS SPEECH ) ( MUSIC SOUNDTRACK DROWNS SPEECH ) This is incredible . Some of those scientists are Nobel laureates . So ? They think you 're a god . - ( SNORTS ) - Don 't laugh . Do you see the way they behave around you ? They 're small compared to you . I can 't think like that . Why ? Because it 's true ? ( HE SNORTS ) I 'm confused by what I feel . Each day is momentous . Each minute , every decision , every action is ... ( SIGHS ) ... historic . Hmm . And I feel separate . You know ? Do you feel that ? That separation ? See ? You are a fucking god . - ( TAPE RUNNING ) - Janus , it 's called " Janus " , and , um ... it 's a protein and it 's incredible . Er ... the hard part was making it so it can 't be detected . It 's split into two elements , which combine in the brain to create Janus . It then sends signals that alter the production of cohesion in fertility . Essentially , it switches off human reproduction . It 's , um ... amazing . Philip , when you say " it switches off human reproduction " , we 're not trying to end the human race . We use a placebo . We leave 5 to 8 % unaffected . They 'll remain fertile . And who do we give that placebo to ? PHILIP : There are certain genetic traits that are undeniably advantageous . Now , I believe I 've isolated a group of people who are genetically stronger ... Group ? Do you mean a race ? Race is not a term that science recognises , but , yes , if you must , then " race " . - That 's the Third fucking Reich . - It 's the opposite of that . I 'm not talking about murder . I 'm talking about allowing some to continue . A world without race . It 's a world without racial fucking genocide ! And can you make Janus decide ? I could . I could find a combination of junk genes that only a certain percentage have , tailor Janus not to trigger when those genes are present . Right , and that would be random ? Nothing would connect those people ? No , it 's junk DNA . Doesn 't do anything . But ... why not choose ? Because that 's not who we are . - ( BELL CHIMING ) - ( BIRDSONG ) ( RABBIT SQUEALS ) ( SQUEALING STOPS ) ( CHATTERING AND LAUGHTER ) BROSCA : So , you 've been to Plovdiv ? - Yes , I love Plovdiv . - Really ? MILNER : He hasn 't been to fucking Plovdiv . What are you talk ... I love Plovdiv . Plovdiv 's my favourite place . He is a fucking liar , Brosca . OK , you tell me what is the name of the main square in Plovdiv . OK . The main square in Plovdiv , right ? It 's got lots of little ... So , the main square in Plovdiv is called ... Plovdiv Main Square . ( OTHERS CHUCKLE ) They 're a straight-speaking people . ( MERENGUE MUSIC PLAYS ) Shall we do the merengue ? Yeah ? Hand on my shoulder . That 's it . Watch my hips . Shall I spin you around ? She 's lovely , Brosca . Merengue ! ( LAUGHS AND CLEARS THROAT ) - Are you OK ? - ( HE GASPS ) Does he know what you do ? Tom . God , no . I love him . And I want him to continue loving me . ( TOILET FLUSHES ) ( MURMURS AND LAUGHTER OUTSIDE ) ( WOMAN LAUGHS ) ( LOW CHATTER AND LAUGHTER ) MILNER : No , we can 't . They 're downstairs . I 'm supposed to be getting whisky . TOM : You 're driving me nuts . I 'll be quick , I promise . You won 't even notice . ( CHUCKLING AND GASPING ) ( KISSING AND PANTING ) - ( GRUNTING ) - Hey ! Philip , I 'm asking you . You have not hurt our son , yes ? Brosca , no . I would never hurt him . I 'm ... I 'm pregnant . I going to have a baby , Philip . ( BOTH SIGH ) ( MUSIC SOUNDTRACK DROWNS SPEECH ) Don 't come in tomorrow . There 's going to be a gas leak . They know too much , Philip . ( WHISPERS ) Jesus Christ , Milner . Do you think they can walk around talking about this ? They 're good people . Good ? ! Why ? Because you know them ? We 're saving a species . Are these few more important than everyone because you 've become attached to them ? ( SNORTS ) We can 't afford attachments , Philip . You need to remember that . What have we got here ? Oh . It 's a rabbit . See ? Do you like the rabbit ? Do you ? You see ? Do you like the rabbit ? You like it ? Look how beautiful it is . Look . Try it . ( SNAP ) ( PLATE FALLS ) ( DOORBELL RINGS ) She 'll be back in a minute . Just popped out . How are you , Tom ? Yeah . ( GULPS AND SIGHS ) Bit fucked , actually . - Do you need anything ? - No . No , no . I 'm gonna go to one of those rehab places they have now . - Oh , that 's great . - Yeah . That 's great , Tom . I really think you know , this time , you know ? Hmm . I heard about the gas leak at the lab . She 's devastated . It means so much to her . Your work . I 've never seen her so alive . Oh ... ( TOM SIGHS ) TOM : She loves you , you know ? Not like that . That she saves for me . With you , it 's much higher . Brain love . She loves your brain . ( HE GAGS ) ( HE VOMITS ) ( GROANS ) ( DOOR OPENS ) - ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ) - ( TOM RETCHES ) Ugh . Oh . - Hey . Come here . Hey . - Oh , Jesus . Let me get that for you . TOM : Did you get the medication ? - I did , I did . - Philip popped round . - ( TOM GASPS ) - MILNER : OK . Feeling better ? Philip Carvel ? I 'm arresting you on suspicion of cruelty to a child . You do not have to say anything , but anything you do say will be taken down ... ( SOBBING ) She 's right . I experimented on him . ( HE SIGHS ) I was trying to inhibit violence . I needed a human subject . He was all I had . It changed him . I 've been trying to put it right . I can 't . I 'm sure you had your reasons . Look , I love Brosca . But this ? She 's harming you . Let me help you with her . She has to go . She 's coming between us . What about Tom ? He 's a fucking time bomb . It 's your love for Tom that puts us in danger . I don 't feel like that about Brosca . I don 't feel like that about anyone . The only person I feel like that about ... is you . You and what we are doing together . ( BOTTLE CLINKS ) ( TOM SIGHS ) - No . No , Tom , please . - ( WATER SPLASHES ) - Please don 't do that . Don 't . - ( DOOR CLICKS ) I did ring . I let myself in . ( GRUNTS ) We need to talk . ( TOM SIGHS ) OK . - OK , talk . - Here ? This is quite sensitive . ( WHISPERS ) I said " talk " . The Network lab in Tel Aviv . One of the men worked out the RNA codes for Janus . He has an idea of what it does . - Has he told anyone ? - Half the lab , as many as 50 people . We 're not sure exactly who yet , but we have it locked down . Do you have a plane ready ? TWA 841 , heading to JFK . We 've told them they 're going to be debriefed by the CIA . Well , you know what we have to do , then . We have to bring it down . We have to plant a bomb aboard the plane and we have to kill all of them . TOM : What are you talking about ? Killing ? Killing who ? Who you going to kill ? What you talking about planes and killing for ? ( WATER SPLASHING ) ( BABY CRYING ) Mr Carvel ? There have been some complications .

We are creating utopia . OK . You 're special . You 're unique . So , yes , you can have the child . But don 't get lost in her , Philip . - NURSE : Mr Carvel ? - Please , don 't get lost in ... You 've had a little girl . ( WHISPERS ) A girl ? A little girl ? ( SIGHS ) She 's she 's beautiful . What are you going to call her ? Jessica . Her name is Jessica .

NEWS REPORTER : The continued waste collectors ' strike has led local authorities to store waste in car parks With threats of a looming oil crisis , talk of - a state of emergency is ... - ... A vote of no confidence in the Labour Government has been called . It 's expected to come down to just one or two votes . It was only two votes . It 's pretty ... pretty tight . Indeed , but , you know , when it 's only two , anything can happen . Coffins ? What a charming place to meet ( ! ) Are these full ? Oh ... the gravediggers ' strike . They 're storing the bodies here . The " Winter of Discontent " , they 're calling it . Leicester Square 's landfill . ( HE SIGHS ) It 's Philip . He 's done it again . What ? No . No , I spoke to him . I 've just come from Rome , where we spoke ... - You spoke , he listened ... ... and I told and then he did it again . Another document , another leak . We think it 's the same thing . The identity of Mr Rabbit . He sent it to Richard Sykes , UK ambassador to Holland . We don 't think Sykes knows what it means . But why Sykes ? Why send it to him ? If the Tories win the next election , he 's on security with Airey Neave . - Airey Neave ? Well , has he seen it ? - We don 't know . Look , why is Philip doing this to us ? He 's finished Janus . But he 's scared of it . He can 't bring himself to destroy it so ... he 's doing the next best thing , he 's destroying me . Jesus . What the hell will he do next ? Letan , I have men at the US lab , - armed men ... - No , no-one touches Philip Carvel . Show me . ( SHE GASPS ) - ( SHE SIGHS ) - ( HE GASPS ) ( HE GASPS ) ( HE GASPS ) Your loyalty breaks my heart . Deal with Sykes . Then we need to talk to Airey Neave . ( SIREN BLARING ) At nine o 'clock this morning , Sir Richard was sitting inside his Rolls-Royce in the grounds of his residence here preparing to drive the short distance to the embassy in the centre of the Hague . At that time , two men rushed up on foot and five shots were fired at the car . Sir Richard was hit and so was his 19-year-old footman , who had just shut the door . - Milner ! - It 's an honour to meet you , Mr Neave . Mr Neave , we believe you may have received some information from Mr Sykes before he died . A document ? I did ! Extraordinarily extravagant stuff . International conspiracies at the heart of many governments , et cetera , et cetera . It 's terribly exciting reading . MILNER : Well , as strange as it may seem , we 're worried that this information may be putting your life at risk . Really ? How dreadful . And do you know who killed poor Richard yet ? Not officially , but we believe it was dissident Republicans . NEAVE : Do we ? Are you talking about " we " as in Ml5 ? Well , yes , I 'm sure that " we " does believe it was the IRA . Or the INLA . Or the RSPCA , for that matter . But you and I , Milner we know it was someone else . And who do we ... think it was ? Why , it was you , Milner . THE ASSISTANT : Are you suggesting that the British security services - assassinated Mr ... - Oh . Are we playing that game ( ? ) If we did ... kill Sykes what makes you think we won 't just kill you ? I 'm not Sykes , Milner . Or Letan . Or Rabbity , or whatever your name is . ( NEAVE SNORTS ) Now , as you know , there 's a vote of no confidence in Mr Callaghan and his government . This Friday , in fact . If we win this vote , there 'll be a general election and Margaret will become Prime Minister . Hooray . But it 's balanced on a knife edge . Alfred Broughton , Labour MP . He 's at death 's door , apparently . And you want us to push him through that door ? Heavens , no ! If you did that , the vote might get delayed . No , I just want you to get him to pull a sickie . - ( INDISTINCT VOICE ON TANNOY ) - ( VOICE ON RADIO ) Mr Carvel ? Who are you ? Your friend Milner sent me . - She 's rather upset with you . - What do you want ? Pleased to meet you . My name is Mr Omida . Er ... should the time come , I 'm to be your daughter 's torturer . I 've been asked to explain my process to you . Now , Jessica 's only four , and always the difficulty with such an age is maintaining life for the maximum amount of time . So , I will need to monitor vital signs throughout . But , er ... this is just a matter of being attentive . ( WHISPERING IN HIS HEAD ) Moo ! ( SHE CHUCKLES ) Mm-mm .

We can 't go to Broughton himself or we risk alerting those around him who are setting this up . But , er ... what about the vote ? I mean , it 's a vote of no confidence . Have you any idea how much that matters ? MILNER : Bernard Weatherill . He 's a Tory MP . There 's a gentlemen 's agreement that if a member of the Government is too ill to vote , then an opposition MP also won 't vote . We have persuaded Bernard to honour that agreement . ( BIRDSONG OUTSIDE ) Bollocks . - Who do you think I am ? - Dr Isherwood , this is ... You 're trying to topple the fucking Government . No , no . I 'm a Labour voter .

Now , can we all just , please , calm down ? ( BIRDSONG OUTSIDE ) Make sure Alfred Broughton doesn 't vote . Will you do that for us ? - ( HISSING IN HIS HEAD ) - MR OMIDA : Mr Carvel ? Philip ? I am Omida . I need to know ... I need to know I can get through to you . Please nod . Good . Torture is communication . So , what I will do is , I will inflict a torture upon your person . Then I 'll go and inflict the same torture upon Jessica . It will be exactly the same , not diminished . What you feel , she will feel . Exactly . You will imagine her screams . Her tears . Please . - Her begging . - Please don 't do that . I will go back and forth this way for a period of several hours and ... if that doesn 't work , then we 'll start all over again but with her in front of you . Now , propriety requires me to ask you if you 'd simply like to give us Janus now . It 's ... perfect . But I 've made a ... an adjustment to it . I 've not been in control of myself , you know ? Well , we can work that out . I promise . PHILIP : It ... it 's not ... ( METAL SCRAPES ) Tell us , Philip , please ?

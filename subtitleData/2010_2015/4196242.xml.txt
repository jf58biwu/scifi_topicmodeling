Okay , hold on again . Whoa ! Dr. Riley , this is not what I signed up for . You know what ? People like Mr. Robbins make me sick .

This is our chance to make a difference . Let 's go ! [ grunting with effort ] You guys did such a good job tonight . Thanks , Dr. Riley . I just wish we could do this every night .

The gator population is down . no permits this season . Hold on , I got my money right here , and the law says first come , first served , and I was here first . He was here first . Yeah , we got a legal right to hunt them gators . Two apiece . you can 't stop us . If I don 't give you those permits , you can 't hunt unless you all wanna go to jail .

Oh , yeah ? Whe-where is this big snake ? It 's in my pants . You wanna see ? Looks more like a Lumbricus terrestris to me . Oh , what 's that ? Some kind of big old anaconda ? Earthworm . [ men laugh ] Shut up . So , uh , where exactly did you see it ? It was right over here . Here , come here . Oh , Ms. Nikki , I wouldn 't do that . This snake is huge . It must have been 15 feet at least . I doubt that . No , I know what I saw . Look , don 't believe me if you don 't want . The snake was here , and it was a python or a conda . I know . I seen plenty of them big suckers in Thailand where my wife 's family 's from . He 's got one of them mail-order wives . Like you aim . All right . You know what ? it 's just a good thing you missed . [ law grunting ] It 's gator season ! [ gunfire ] Sounds like Zeke again . Crap the bed , look at that . Oh , man , look at him . He 's going for the gator . I got 10 on the python . Look at him . I got 20 on the gator . That gator 's gonna chomp his ass . What the hell is that ? That 's the sound he makes right before he 's ready to strike . Well , it 's creepy . Kill it . Hey , what are you doing ? Don 't kill them ! Just please don 't kill ' em , all right ? I 'm not gonna . Uh ! Sorry . Oh ! I 'm trying to lure the snakes . Why would you do that ? So you people don 't kill them . I 'm using pheromones . What 's a pheromone ? Oh , never mind . I 'll be right back . Don 't hurt him . Hurt him ? That woman 's got a thing for snakes . I don 't like snakes . Killed Bubba . ( Terry ) That 's 72 dead gators this month . I think I 'm gonna have to bust out the scuba gear and get the rest of it . [ gunshots ] Damn it , Zeke . I 'm gonna have to go take care of this . Listen , if Justin calls for lunch , tell him I 'll be at the canal , okay ? An right . ( both ) Bitch . [ truck radio plays country rack music ] [ music stops ] Everything okay ? You need some help ? Oh , no . All good . Thanks . All righty . Have a good one . [ music starts back up ] [ brakes squeal Damn ! Die ! Augh ! Augh ! The-the python . You killed it . Well , yeah . It was , uh , it was nothing . Nothing ? Wha-what 's wrong with you ? Huh ? What ? Lady , you were almost bitten in half . Look , these-these snakes need to be released back into their natural habitat , not run over by some murderer in a truck ! Yeah , well , you 're welcome . He swallowed the dog whole . I had to kill him . Baby ! Babe . Kiss her like a real man . Put your tongue down her throat . I just killed a 20-foot python back there . Am I your hero or what ? Crap . So I 'm just not a hero today . Oh , no , honey babe . It just means that there 's more than one of these things . Whoa . At least we know now what 's decimating the gator population . I want these snakes gone . Okay . Tonight . We have to set traps . They 're not native to this environment . They could destroy all wildlife . I have to kill them right away . Well , me and my boys can just shoot ' em . That is , if you 'll give us the permits and everything . Zeke , spread the word . It is now snake hunting season . Ha-ha ! That 's what I wanted to hear . Get ' em , boys . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Just make sure that you cut it right hack here behind the skull . And then , and this is very important , once you get that head off , you gotta pith it as fast as you can . Just scramble its brains around like that , all right ? Otherwise , otherwise this head can stay alive for up to an hour . No kidding ? Yeah , just stay alive and get you . I hate snakes . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Come on , people . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . They 've been here all morning . What do you wanna do about it ? Ah , it 's just college kids trying to save the world. it 's hunting season . There 's always a few wack jobs . Just keep ' em 20 feet from these hunters over here , though . Are you sure you wanna issue those special hunting permits ? I 'm thinking in this case , the cure might end up being worse than the disease . It 's possible . The ones we 're looking for are about twice this size . Won 't wrap around your arm . Wrap around your whole body . Okay , listen up . The locations you 've been authorized to hunt these snakes are the Francis S. Taylor wildlife area and the southern Glades wildlife area . And I want you to stay in groups of two . Any questions ? How many of them pythons are out there ? We really don 't know . We 're hoping that we get a handle on that before they can multiply . But pythons can lay up to 100 eggs per clutch , so there might be a lot of ' em . Please , you have got to stop this . I mean , these are living creatures . They can adapt and survive . You know what , ma 'am ? Don 't touch me . Ooh , somebody had bitch for breakfast . The pythons are decimating the gator population , the Osceola turkey , the wood rat . They could even take out some of the 200 panthers in the area . Nature can balance itself without our interference . Let them live. the pythons are at the top of the food chain . That 's just the way it is . That 's how it 's supposed to be . No , that 's not how it is . The pythons aren 't at the lop of the food chain . I am . And I say we 're gonna take care of this problem right now . Ooh , you 're a monster . You know what ? If you don 't like it , you can just take you little self right out of my Everglades . My Everglades ? Did she just say my everglades ? She did . Hi . What are you doing here ? I came here to help , you know . Baby , I wanna do whatever I can . And the fact that I had to miss that dinner with the wedding planner , I 'll just have to find a way to live with it . Oh , okay . All right . Well , keep me posted . Will do , boss . Later , gator . Okay . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . Hunters are cowards . Stop the madness . [ dog barking ] Archie , what is it , boy ? [ hissing ] Come on , Arch . Nothin ' here . [ shouts ] Hey , hon . Your fancy P.R. lady called about your friends of the glades fundraiser . She 's got a Monkey that 's gonna entertain at the event . Well , how 's a Monkey supposed to raise enough money for the Everglades ? How would I know ? P.R. people are crazy . Now remember , just snakes . ( Tommy ) Forget that . I 'm hunting gators if I see ' em . Don 't blow it , Tommy . We just have snake permits . Snake permits in the Everglades . that ain 't natural . [ quacking ] Whoa . [ grunts ] I didn 't even see that there . Yeah , well , that 's the thing about these pythons . They could be right next to you , you wouldn 't even know it . What are you gonna do with it now ? Gonna pith the head . This is where old Hank Roberts disappeared , so keep your eyes open . You got ii . [ to himself ] Keep focused RJ . [ gasps ] Those are some big suckers . Terry , I 'm at the dynamite depot . We got a huge clutch of python eggs over here . I mean , whatever laid these , has to be huge as well . I 'll go ahead and bring the eggs in for study , but I 'm still hoping we can find the mama . No , RJ . Go ahead and destroy those eggs . ( Chris ) RJ ! What ? What is it ? I 'm coming ! Hang on ! RJ ! What ? What do you see ? What do you see ? Damn it , I missed him . You missed what ? The snake . It did that . All right , come on . Ain 't nothin ' more we can do about Hank here . Terry said to shoot the hell out of ' em . Okay . [ both laugh ] I gotta reload . [ shouts ] RJ ! [ loud groaning ] Hold on , Chris ! Hold on ! Aagh ! Here , snakey snake . Where is this python , anyway ? Could be anywhere . [ quack quack quack ] You killed a damn duck out of season , Tommy . What ? It was an accident . [ wheezing laugh ] Well , it should be good eatin ' .. Terry , we got some bad news . They saw a python over in Big Cypress . Didn 't get it . Have you heard from Justin yet ? Nope . Mm-Mm . I gotta go sit down . [ law grunting ] Oh , no . Oh . [ law grunting ] Justin ! [ hissing ] Ah ! [ groans ] [ gasps ] [ coughing ] [ snowing ] [ grunting with effort ] [ grunting ] Justin . Come in , Justin . Justin ? Justin ? Go for Justin . Thank goodness .. Oh , baby , I love you . I love you , too . Tell me that you 're okay . I am now . But , Terry , it 's a lot worse then we thought . Justin ? Justin ? Baby , did you try to say something ? Justin ? Hey , talk to me , would you ? Tell me how great our wedding will be . What ? What are you talking about ? Justin ? Justin ? Ah ! Justin ? Justin ! Terry , what 's up ? I don 't know . Something 's wrong with Justin . Get RJ . We 're gonna go see what 's wrong . RJ ! Justin , come in . Come in . [ all calling ] Justin ! Justin ! Wait. I hear something . [ static ] It 's his walkie . Justin ! Justin ! Wait for me . I 'm coming . [ hissing ] Where is he ? [ shouts ] Ah ! [ static ] [ shuddering ] Would you look at this ? People are dying , and it 's all that woman ' s fault . Her ignorance is sending People to their deaths . Hey , snakes are at the top of the food chain . I tried to warn you , and now look what 's happening . [ crying ] How dare you ! You crazy , cold-blooded snake-loving bitch ! Crazy ? Me ? Look , I 'm not one who 's trying to control nature and bend it lo her will . No , that would be you . You 're responsible for that man 's death today . You ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Time to go . You , keep moving ! I 'm not as friendly as the condas . Move here . You , too . Come on . School 's out . Let 's keep going . Take this . Keep going . Walk . I talked to Justin 's father . We should get the body over to Fred 's Funeral Home in Flagstaff . Yeah . Not a problem . Sweetie , you gotta go home and get some rest . Those snakes destroyed my home ! I know . They ruined everything ! They took Justin from me . I know . Look , I 've got this friend Sylvie from the church , and she has a friend in the Appalachian Indian tribe . He swears that he can help us kill the snakes . I don 't want some witch doctor . No , no , no , no . He 's a herpetologist . Dr. Diego Ortiz . He 's written books and been on Oprah . He can help us . Fine , but I 'm not waiting for him . I 'm gonna take care of these things tonight . How ? How are you gonna take care of it ? We need a bigger gator ! Okay , give me your keys , 'cause you 're in no shape to drive . You want a bigger gator ? I 'll get you one . [ low grunting ] I just know that park ranger 's gonna try something else . I just know it . Okay , we really have to keep our eye on her . 2417 , 365 . Yeah , but , Nikki , they already kicked us out . I mean , what else can we do ? That 's what we 're gonna do . Cameras in the glades . We can watch every single thing she does . If she hurts my snakes , we 'll get it on film . What happens if we run into the snakes ? Don 't get eaten . Hey , honey . Hey , Gram . How 's it going ? Good to see you . Hey , Terry . Enough small talk . Where 's the stuff ? Go get it . Look I don 't know what you guys want with this , all right ? And I don 't really wanna ask . I 'm afraid . It works out just fine , because I 'm not gonna tell you anything anyhow . But you realize that some of this stuff has bad side effects like aggression , acne . You have enough here for a whole army . Manny , just give her the anabolic steroid . Otherwise I 'm gonna have to arrest you for illegal possession . Manny , go put it in the truck . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . What 's-what 's that box ? I don 't think I should give you that box , yet . It 's something the university is experimenting with , And it 's only taken in small amounts . I don 't think you should use it . Well , what is it exactly ? It 's experimental . But the guys on the team won 't even take it . What it does is it blocks the proteins that limit muscle growth . They 're called myoslatins . So by taking that , your muscles grow indefinitely ? Yeah . Oh . Don 't worry , Manny . We 'll be very careful with this . Go ahead , hon . Okay . Now all we have to do is find some dead chickens . I don 't know Terry . Maybe this isn 't such a great idea . Even to me it 's beginning to feel a little nuts . What choice do we have ? Those monsters are out there . They 're ruining everything . It 's like they wanted to come and get me . To take away my happiness . To take away anything that ever meant anything to me . Don 't you see ? Tell me that you see that . Hey , you know , be careful with those . 'Cause that 's the special stuff that Manny told us about . Right . Screw ii . That 's a whole lot of dead chicken . Well ? The cameras are working fine . [ low grunting ] Are you sure about this ? Creating bigger , stronger gators to eat the snakes ? The balance of nature must be preserved okay ? So , give me another dead chicken . I mean , what 's crazy about this ? We 're just feeding steroids to gators . There 's nothing crazy about this . What could go wrong ? What the hell are they doing ? Looks like they 're feeding the gators chicken . Why would she be doing that ? Gia , make sure you 're recording this . You got ii . Let 's go home . Come on , Terry . Let 's go home , huh ? It 's okay . Okay , come on . I 'll take care of you . Let 's go . Come on . What the hell are you doing to my gators ? Sir , this is federal property . Permits are not being issued . I 'm not a hunter . Who are you ? I 'm Dr. Ortiz . You can call me Diego . It 's remarkable , I must say , the increased aggression in these animals . You can see the stress in the plants . It 's a good thing you called me to help you figure this out . Oh , yeah , you know , thank you very much , but I-I 've taken care of it . Actually , no , you haven 't . What the hell is that ? Highly disturbing . Your animals are getting bigger .

You need to shut this party down , get the Governor back on the phone , tell him we need the National Guard out here yesterday . Yeah . Wait . Hold that thought . I have pictures . Hello , and thank you all for coming . A year ago , my fiancé and I thought of this event to raise awareness for the Everglades and its intense need for conservation outreach . The Everglades are home to 36 threatened or endangered species , all of which are greatly affected by changes in water flow . That is why restoring this estuary is so important . When I look out and I see this beautiful lush area , I think of my late fiancé , Justin Regina . And , and now , ladies and gentlemen , keep drinking . [ applause ] Mickey Dolenz is looking good , right ? Yeah , he 's hot . What the hell are you doing in my VIP tent ? I want you out of here now ! Oh , it 's your VIP tent , is it ? In your Everglades . Hm ? You treat this as if it were your own private little domain , like you own it or something , but it 's not really your property now , is it ? Oh , it absolutely is . And to prove it to you , I 'm gonna have you thrown out by my deputy . Oh , I 'm not going anywhere . No , not until everybody sees this . What is that ? That is footage of you planting steroids in those chickens and feeding them to those gators . That proves nothing . Oh , bitch , please . You 're going down . Give ii to me ! It wasn 't enough that you had to kill your own fiancé , huh ? You had to kill other innocents as well . You are gonna get it , you gator-baiting bitch . Only in your dreams . [ gasps ] Give me that ! Crazy snake-loving maniac ! [ party guests gasp ] You insane gator-doping lunatic . Give it to me ! Give it to me ! Get off of me ! [ both shout ] [ guests gasp ] [ grunts ] [ guests gasp ] You did not just do that . What ? There were pheromones I could have used to lure those snakes . [ guests gasp ] Ha ! [ groaning ] Get off of me ! [ shouting ] Major Cupelli ? RJ ? [ low grunting ] Ah ! Stop it ! You stop it , you bitch ! [ born grunting ] You bitch ! [ both shout ] [ low grunting ] [ hissing ] [ both grunting ] Um , folks , folks ! Uh , over here . Eyes this way , please . Why don 't I introduce you to the star of this incredible night , our performer , Mickey Dolenz ! Well , it 's a pleasure to be here and support the preservation of the Everglades . Everybody ! Get in your cars and leave this area immediately . Everybody , please , you have to get out of here now . Okay . I 'd like to start with one of my biggest hits from the ' 60S . Hit it . [ loud grunting ] [ people screaming ] ( Diego ) No . Listen up . Anyone else with a weapon should get it out . Now ! They don 't go down easy , do they ? How you doing on ammo , kid ? I 'm good . I got more . How you doing ? Not so good . Make ' em count . [ shouts ] Bottles . Gather bottles . We need bottles . I don 't know if we 're gonna be able to hold out until the guard comes . Tampon . Bad news , friend . The guard ain 't coming . Terry thought you were getting too big for your britches . You 're kidding , right ? No . All right , I 'm kidding . Throw the sucker . [ screams ] [ both panting ] Wait . Sh . Do you hear something ? What ? No . I think we 're alone now . Right . There doesn 't seem to be anyone around , hut ... I 'm pretty sure I heard something . [ growling ] [ both ] Your fault . [ both scream ] I think you gm him . Oh , my God . You 'll never believe what we saw out there . Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . We gotta get out of here now . But how ? There ' s my truck . That 's where we ' re going . Okay . What the hell do we do now ? I don 't know , but I 'm freezing . What do you think , Terry ? You wanna get the National Guard out here before the creatures leave the Everglades ? They 're extremely territorial . We have to come up with a way to stop them before they get to Miami . Before it 's too late . I think it already is too late . [ siren wailing ] Drive ! Drive ! They got the mall . I 've always hated that mall . Well , maybe we can ... How much of that pheromone can you get your hands on ? Oh , so now I have good ideas , huh ? How much ? I have a lot of it in my office . I confiscated a lot of it . Confiscated ? Even if we can lure them out to the quarry , we 'd have to get back in there to set off the dynamite . Got to get all those eggs , tea . If those eggs hatch , forget it . No , don 't move . Maybe it won 't see us . Gators can 't see straight ahead . It might not even know we 're here . If I can just back it up in a straight line . [ both ] Damn it ! Get away ! Get out ! His mouth ! Ah ! I 'm trying ! Oh , my God ! Put it through his mouth . I 'm trying for it . We gotta get you closer . One more ! One more ! Shoot him right down the mouth . Aim for the mouth ! Bastard ! ( Terry ) Watch out ! The snake ! Damn ! Hey ! My rifle ! Get my rifle ! [ Terry and Nikki screaming ] No ! [ no audio ] So , what are we gonna do ? there has to be something that we can do . Diego , you 're a pilot , right ? Yeah . So ? So have you ever flown a crop duster ? What are you thinking ? If we could get the pheromones from my office ... We could spray ' em down the highway ... And lure ' em into the Everglades . But we 'd have to set up the explosives beforehand in the quarry . It could work . Nikki , take the stick while I load my gun . I hate small planes . I really hate small planes . Would you shut up and stop being such a wimp ? Let 's get this straight . We 're gonna drop you at the quarry , Nikki . While you 're setting up the explosives , we 're gonna go pick up the pheromones and start dusting the highway . We 're gonna lead those animals right to you . Exactly why do I need to be the one to stay in this rattletrap and work the hopper ? Well , if you 're scared , I can do it , but that would mean that you have to go to the quarry and set the dynamite . Unless , of course , you don 't know how to set explosives . In fact , I don 't . Forgive me , but I 'm not a terrorist like some people . Environmentalist . Excuse me . Which sometimes requires extreme measures , okay ? Diego , can you land this thing ? My office is across the river . Okay , I 'll meet you back here when I 'm done . Yeah . Nikki ? Good luck . [ crackling ] [ baby gators growl in their shells ] [ whispers ] Okay . Pretend they 're not here . Okay . Oh , God . Oh , don 't hatch , yet . All right . It 'll all be okay . It 's okay . Oh , just relax . All right , this is the last of it . Okay . We 're good to go ? Let 's do it . Okay . Okay , I think we 're far enough out . Wanna give it a shot ? Yeah , let 's do it . All right . On three , I 'm gonna pop the hopper . Okay . One , two , three . Did it open ? No , it 's not working . Oh , hell . Wait . Be careful . Maybe I can rig it . Okay , yeah , it 's working . it 's spraying . Good job . Get a little lower , though . Roger that . That was a good save , kid . I don 't see any animals coming , do you ? Nothing moving . Get even lower . Here goes . Wait . They 're coming ! Yeah ? A lot of ' em ? Yeah , a lot of ' em . All right ! It 's amazing . I can see all of them . Oh , I hope Nikki 's getting that dynamite ready . [ baby gators growling in their shells ] What 's that ? Is that the Turkey Point nuclear facility ? Yeah , yeah . We gotta steer clear of that . We gotta stay as far away from that as we possibly can . [ both shout ] [ alarm buzzes ] Hang on ! Hold on ! Come on , come on , come on . Come on for me , baby ! Come ... Ah ! Shoot ! Darn it ! All right , concentrate . Concentrate . [ growling ] Get back . Okay . All right . Oh , God . No . Back . Okay . Diego , are you okay ? Terry . Diego , are you okay ? I 'm good . You ? [ aircraft creaking ] We gotta go . We gotta get out of here . They 're coming . They 're coming ! Come on ! No , you can make it . Come on ! My footie under ... No , my foot . I 'm gonna pull you out . Come on . Okay . Okay . [ groans loudly ] No , no , no . Listen , it ain 't working . What can I do ? What can I do ? What should I do ? You gotta get out of here . You gotta lead the animals away from the reactor . You gotta grab the pheromone . Grab the pheromone and keep ' em away from here . Go ! Go now . Come on , go , go . [ creaking ] I found a car . Good . Now go . Hurry . I just can 't leave you here . You have to . You have to keep those things away from here . Go now ! Diego , I 'm sorry . [ sirens wailing ] Ah ! [ groans ] [ yanking ] Keep coming . ( pilot ) We have a visual on a survivor . Should we pick him up ? ( dispatch ) Affirmative . Proceed with caution . Little gators , don 't call your mommies . Get back . Okay . [ shouts ] [ shouting ] Oh , God . Don ? " Stay back . [ roaring ] Shoot ! Terry ? Nikki , where are you ? Terry , I 'm down here in the cave , but I can 't get out . Okay , hold on . I 'm coming to get you . [ roar ] Okay , whatever you 're doing , is really pissing her off . Shoot . Ah ! Terry , you saved my life . We 're stuck in this together . Where is Diego ? Is he okay ? No . No , the plane went down . Look , distress calls can be heard up from four miles from baby gators . With gators this big , God only knows . It could be 100 miles or so . Pythons , too . The plan 's gonna work . They 'll be coming for a meal . They 're coming . Oh , m y God . What are we gonna do ? The snakes are here . The yelps from the baby gators are luring them to the quarry . We have to go back . Come on . Come on ! Damn it . I know . What a mess . If we don 't get out of here , we 're gonna ... We 're gonna have to throw the switch . It 's all my fault . No , it 's-it 's my fault . Wait , what do you mean ? What do you mean what do I mean ? I did it . I-I released those snakes into the Everglades . Bitch . [ yanking ] Wait . Sh , sh . Do you hear that ? It 's a helicopter . Come on . Let 's go . Okay , we 're coming . We 're coming down . ( Diego ) Come on . Come on . I got you . Terry ! Oh , my God ! They 're gonna get her . Terry ! Help me ! You gotta pull her up ! Help me ! Please ! Come on ! Pull her up ! [ shouts ] [ snowing ] Hold on ! Hold on ! Is it wired to blow ? Yes . You got the detonator ? Yes . [ Click ] [ screams ] Nikki ! [ shouting ] Turn this thing around ! She 's alive ! I 'm alive ! Unbelievable . I 'm alive ! I 'm alive ! Oh , my God . Go down . Go down . Get it down ! [ shouts ] And so here we are , a year later , to celebrate this beautifully restored estuary , a project so important to the future of the Everglades . This estuary will preserve the Everglades for centuries to came , and it is fitting that we dedicate it in the names of those heroic women who gave their lives to save this park . To save this city , a city that each of them , in her way , loved so much . [ cheers and applause ] So everyone , I ... I now dedicate the O 'Hara-Riley estuary . ♫ Better stick to the road ♫ ♫ There 's a wild wind a-churning ♫ ♫ In these woods takin ' hold ♫ ♫ She ain 't lookin ' for riches ♫ ♫ She is just lookin ' for souls ♫ ♫ Don 't you think you 're gonna get away without bein ' seen ♫ ♫ ' Cause that girl 's gonna find you ♫ ♫ She 's a serpentine ♫ [ harmonica walls ] ♫ What the devil 's forgotten ♫ ♫ Well it 's right on her tongue ♫ ♫ She gets all up inside you ♫ ♫ Till your Voodoo 's undone ♫ ♫ She 's gonna tattoo your heart ♫ ♫ With a number 13 ♫ ♫ ' Cause when that girl comes to find you ♫ ♫ She 's a serpentine ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ And when she starts to shed her skin ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ She 's gonna hook him like original sin ♫ ♫ Don 't let her in ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ She 's gonna find you she 's the serpentine ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ She 's gonna find ya ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ [ harmonica walls ] ♫ She 'll swallow you whole ♫ ♫ With a taste for desire ♫ ♫ Cool you with her breath ♫ ♫ Then lead you straight to the fire ♫ ♫ She 's like lilith the legend ♫ ♫ But she 's twice as mean ♫ ♫ Ain 't nothin ' gonna satisfy that serpentine ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ Ooh ♫ ♫ Ain 't nothin ' gonna satisfy that serpentine ♫

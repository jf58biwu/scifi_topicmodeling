 Previously on " Believe " : Inexplicable phenomena have been part of Bo 's life . People would try to kidnap her . They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world . I 'm asking you to save her . You 're being executed for two counts of felony murder . I 'm here to help you escape . When you first saw her , you felt something , didn 't you ? - You 're crying . - No , I wasn 't . Yes , you were . You know why you were crying ? You remembered you were good once . How many weeks is this job supposed to last ? It 'll be the best years of your life . You 'll have to keep moving from place to place . - Now , where do we really go ? - Philadelphia . It 's gonna be okay . [ sighs ] Hey , you wanna get off me ? You 're drooling , for Pete 's sake . - Where are we ? - I don 't know . Jersey somewhere . Stay on your side . - I am on my side . - No , you 're not . Yeah , I am . - [ chuckles ] Listen to that mouth . If I talked back like that I 'd have been smacked into next week . Did your parents teach you any manners ? I don 't remember my parents . Well , maybe that 's a blessing . You don 't like your mom and dad ? My mom was all right . My dad , not so much . Is that why you 're a criminal ? I 'm not a criminal . - You were in jail . - Yeah . For something I didn 't do . I bet everyone in prison says that . [ siren wailing ] - What 's wrong ? - Quiet . - Why did we park ? - There 's a cop outside . Have you seen this gentleman ? I need to search your bus . 10-4 . - They 're looking for you . - Quiet , I said . Have you seen this man ? Ma 'am , have you seen William Tate ? What about you , Ma 'am ? Have you seen William Tate ? What are you gonna do when he finds you ? Shh . Sir , what about you ? Have you seen William Tate ? You ? William Tate ? What about you ? [ siren whooping ] Jim ... What the ... Jim . Jim , the car 's rolling back ! Jim ! 10-24 , we have a situation . You did that ? Tate and Bo will need a safe house every few days . We 'll be the advance . Accommodations will be paid for in cash . How long is it gonna be like this ? As long as it takes . - Hey . Building 's secure . - Hey . Good . Thank you . Uh , since we 're all here , I want to say a few words . I need to tell everyone that I know that we 've all risked our careers , connection to family , friends . And yes , we are risking our lives . But we are doing it for what we believe in ... to protect Bo Adams . And we have to make sure that she grows up to be an instrument of peace and not war . - Come on , kid . - Where are we going ? Disneyland . In here . We gotta stay out of sight for a while . [ P.A. page in background ] - It stinks in here . - Well , you stink too . Here , take this . What about meeting Milton ? He said he had a place for us to stay . That 's not till tonight . In Philly . Today we 're on our own . [ airy , mysterious music ] ♪ ♪ Not a single death row escapee in 80 years , and I 'll be damned if it 's happening on my watch . - Now , last sighting ... - Farrell . of William Tate was approximately 11 : 00 A.M. in Baltimore at St. Ann 's hospital . But he wasn 't admitted , there was no report of injury . This is really something you 're gonna love . Yet as soon as he shows up , - the whole place goes sideways ... - Ferrell . - What , Martin ? - Director Lofton is here . All the way from Quantico . He 's waiting in your office . Elizabeth Farrell . Grew up in Detroit , daughter at 17 , work scholarship to Rutgers , joined the FBI right out of college . Been with the bureau ever since , sir . You 're working the Tate case . Some relevant information has come to light . Sensitive information . Tate is suspected to be in the company of this little girl . Bo Adams . [ sighs ] A murderer with a kid . - I hate this kind of stuff . - We all do . But this is no ordinary child . What makes her so special ? That , for now , is classified . Classified ? I don 't understand . Everything about Bo Adams is classified . That 's why I 'm sending you to get briefed by Roman Skouras . Roman Skouras , Roman Skouras ? - Yes , the geneticist . - He 's a private citizen . Works in cooperation with your government . He 's chartered you a helicopter . You 're leaving in 20 minutes . Take your two best agents . Bo Adams must be located and recovered , unharmed . Now , remember , this is highly classified . Dr. Skouras runs the top-secret project orchestra , a group that claims to have isolated a gene linked to telekinetic abilities . Skouras is our partner . We consider him erratic and not to be trusted . Keep your eye on him . I appreciate the urgency , Agent Farrell . I appreciate the lift , Dr. Skouras . Director Lofton said there 's a kid , Bo Adams . She 's a national defense priority . Glad to hear they feel that way . They should . Bo is one of a kind . She 's exponentially stronger than anyone else here . She has been since she was a toddler . Right , but what I 'm having a hard time figuring out is how this little girl got away in the first place . I told you . That man , Milton Winter , took her . And Milton Winter was CIA field agent psychologist ? He ran the program prior to Dr. Boyle here . And why would he want to kidnap Bo ? My opinion ? He thinks he 's protecting her . From what ? He believes wrongly that the program was inflicting emotional trauma on the girl . - Was it ? - Absolutely not . - The girl was well cared for . - And how about these others ? All once members of the program . And all of whom broke ranks . Are you implying something , Agent Farrell ? No , I 'm not implying . I 'm just processing how to solve this case . Yes . I 'm afraid we don 't share the same agenda . How 's that ? I don 't care about William Tate . Only Bo . And I intend to use every resource at my command to recover her . [ razor buzzing ] You look like a naked mole rat . A what ? A naked mole rat . That 's what you look like . What 's a naked mole rat ? A rodent native to east Africa . Well ... Never said I won any beauty contests , so ... Stanley likes the light on . - Well , Stanley ain 't real , so ... - Yes , he is . He 's the only one who 's always been with me . [ sighs ] Fine . Whatever you want . [ sighs ] You 're about to see one of our subjects . Sean 's not as powerful as Bo , but it 'll give you the idea . Sean has suffered severe behavioral and emotional problems due to his ability . Fairly common in our subjects , I 'm sorry to say . But over the last three years , we 've worked hard to help him harness his gifts . He 's made enormous progress . We 're quite proud of him . Just do me a favor when we go in . Don 't look him in the eye . I 'm sorry ? He doesn 't like eye contact . It just ... it ... Could get uncomfortable . - Hi , Sean . - Hello . Thank you for letting us visit you today . You 're welcome . So , you think you can build something for us ? What would you like me to build you ? Anything you like . I like lions . [ chuckles ] Then build a lion . How 's that ? I 'd call it a miracle . How about you ? Got it . Yeah , I got it . Thank you . William Tate sighted at a bus station . - Where ? - Atlantic City . What I need , Mr. Levay , is a tracker . Someone not on the FBI 's radar who can find the needle in a haystack . - Who can recover the asset . - She is not an asset . She is a child . And she must be recovered safe . That is critical . We understand the operational sensitivity , Dr. Skouras . But we feel we have several operatives who can accomplish the objective . Our personal favorite ... Marcus Krakauer . Have you heard of him ? Rumors . Well , Marcus has been with us for 12 years . I think this will give you a sense of his field demeanor . Can he bring Bo back safe , unharmed physically and emotionally ? Krakauer achieves his objective . That 's to bring the girl back safe . He 's your man . Hey . Hey , come on . Told you I don 't like you laying on me like that . Sorry . I was dreaming . Yeah , about what ? - That you 're my dad . - Jeez , that 's not a dream . That sounds like a freakin ' nightmare . All right , the coast is clear . Come on . Let 's go . So that thing you do ... - Yeah ? - Tell me about it . Like what ? Like I saw you do that thing with the pigeons , you slipped the gear on that squad car . I mean , like , you can do stuff . Yeah . I can do really little stuff when I want . But bigger stuff , I can 't really tell when it 's gonna happen . - Well , that sucks . - It 's like hiccups . It starts and then it stops . And it 's usually when I 'm mad . Why do you want to know so bad ? Well , ' cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don 't have a place to stay , so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options . You want to do something wrong . - No , I don 't . - Yes , you do . I can tell things , and you want to use me to steal . You know , you got a lot of nerve , kid . You 're gonna be unhappy and alone one day . Yeah , and you 're gonna be a sucker your whole life and someday it 'll dawn on you . - Unhappy and alone . - Natural-born sucker . - Unhappy and alone . - Natural-born sucker ! - Unhappy and alone ! - [ wind gusts ] Whoa . Sorry . I told you , it 's like hiccups . You said you can move little things when you want to . - Yeah . - Little things . Like dice ? All right , all right . Game time . We 're gonna put that talent of yours to good use . We 're gonna play a little game called craps . - Craps ? - Wipe that look off your face . You 're gonna love it . All you gotta do is you try and roll 7s . Okay ? You roll a 7 in any combination , you win . Think you can help me with that ? - I don 't think this is fair . - You want to eat or not ? - I 'm starving . - Good . You 're motivated . Look , you do this , you eat , I eat , everyone wins . Okay , look , here 's the deal , kid . They 're not gonna let you on the casino floor , so I want you to go over to that restaurant right over there and get yourself a milkshake . What 's a milkshake ? Come on , really , kid ? What kind of childhood have you had ? I told you , I never met my parents . Well , that makes a lot of sense . Look , you sure you can make the dice come up 3 and 4 ? - I think I can . - What do you mean you think ? You said you could do the little stuff . I can do the little stuff most of the time , - just not every time . - Okay , fine . Look , I 'm not asking for a pigeon thing or whatever . It 's just a couple of dice . This works , then it 's surf and turf and feather beds tonight . No more bus station bathrooms . - Okay ? - Okay . All right . Now , get outta here . Thank you very much . Bus station attendant reconfirmed . - Tate is in A.C. with the kid . - Good . This oughta flush them into the open . Issue the Amber alert . Hi . What can I get for you , darling ? A milkshake , please . Milkshake . You got I.D. for that ? What 's an I.D. ? It 's something that says how old you are . - Oh , I 'm ten . - Okay , thought so . I got a kid a little younger than you . - And his name 's Jesse . - Do you know him ? No . So how did you know what his name is ? I ... I don 't know . Okay . One milkshake . Vanilla okay ? Thank you . [ sighs ] Gimme 10 on any 7 . $ 10 , any 7 . That 's a bet . - On the house . - Thank you . You 're welcome . 7 , winner . Yeah ! 7 on buzz over there . Beginner 's luck . Or skill . Well , he 's got swagger , people , I 'll give him that . All right . Know what ? I 'm feeling lucky . Got another 7 coming . Parlay that bet . Again . The man knows odds on 7 . Two in a row . Doubles down . I like it . 7 ! [ people cheering ] - Winner ! - Yeah ! Buy a lottery ticket before your luck runs out , eh ? The feds have made a move . It 's an Amber alert . - We have to reach out to Tate . - And say what ? I can 't magically call off an Amber alert , Miss Channing . We 'll see ' em tonight . They 'll be all right . They 're not gonna make it to tonight . Yes , they will . The man is resourceful . I wouldn 't even let him babysit my dog . If he freaks out , he 's gonna dump her . He won 't do that . He cannot do that . You need to tell him . Tell him he 's her father . [ slurps ] How 's it going ? Another one , please . Another ... you 're just like my son Jesse . He never met a dessert he didn 't like . - How old is Jesse ? - You 're the mind reader . 5 1 / 2 ? You 're the one that should be playing these tables . I 'm sorry he 's sick . Okay , you are really freaking me out now . I can just feel things sometimes . Does that ever happen to you ? 7 ! Yeah ! Whoo-hoo ! [ crowd cheers ] - Nice . - All right . Big tip to the dealer man . Gotta make you happy . I never seen anybody throw six 7s in a row . At least it 's happening to a nice guy . You 're not that nice , though , are you ? - No , I 'm not that nice . No . - [ chuckles ] Hey , deal me out . I 'm gonna pass on the dice . - I bet you 're a bad boy . - Some would call me that . Well , I want a picture with the bad boy . [ shutter clicks ] Whoa , whoa , no , hold on . I wasn 't ready . Hold on . We 'll need that denomination on the table . I haven 't done that in seven years either . Well , we can remedy that . Are you staying at the hotel ? Oh , I can 't , darling . I gotta go to Philly and meet up with ... in fact , I lost track of time . For the love of God . Don 't disappear like that . Time to go . Wait ! I won something ! Do you realize what you 're jeopardizing ? I 'm trying to rescue a little girl , Dr. Skouras . That 's what an Amber alert is . Millions of dollars , years of labor . Of my labor . If Bo becomes - a public spectacle ... - Then what ? Then she has a normal life as a normal kid ? She 's not a normal kid . She never will be . My job , per Director Lofton , is to safely recover Bo , and that 's what I 'm gonna do . Our algorithms troll social media for face rec . 12 minutes ago we got a hit at a casino in Atlantic City . That 's William Tate . We then hacked the casino surveillance feed , and came up with this . Oh , my God . It 's Bo . It 's definitely Bo . - You 're sure this is good . - Positive . I got a definite I.D. on William Tate and Bo Adams seven minutes ago , together , at the Clover Casino . Okay , alert the local authorities and closest regional feds . Put up checkpoints on all interstates and give me feeds on train platforms . I want this Amber alert plastered on every flat surface in Atlantic City . Let 's bring these guys in . Get me Atlantic City police . - Get me a location on Krakauer . - He 's on his way , sir . Ow ! Why are you squeezing my arm like that ? Why do you ask so many questions ? - Why is that a problem ? - Why are you bothering me ? Hey ! Hey ! Taxi ! Taxi ! [ horn blares ] Come on ! hey ! Bonnie ! It 's my friend from the casino . Hey , how are you ? Hey , you don 't mind giving us a lift ? Yeah , that 's fine . Come on in . Where to ? Uh , the train station . [ chuckles ] You had enough of A.C. ? For now . Hey , that 's Jesse . That 's him , yeah . That 's my little soldier . Is he okay ? He ... he will be . He 's ... he needs surgery . Which is why I 'm working 80-plus a week . But I am not complaining . - Can I meet him ? - Uh ... Up to your dad . It 's cool with me . [ siren wails ] Uh , sure . Yeah , we got time before the next train . [ blinker ticking ] I 'm home . - Hi , Jess . - Hi ! [ smooches ] I brought a new friend for you . - Hi , Jesse . - Hi . Want to play ? Sure . Myeloid leukemia . Three rounds of chemo , but it keeps coming back . Which is why we are gonna go for a bone marrow transplant . Insurance won 't cover it ? It 's experimental . And expensive . - Tough kid . - Yup . Tough mom too . What any mom would do . These two are twins . This one is Nim and this one is Bib . They are very naughty , and they could hear each other 15 miles away - without walkie-talkies . - [ chuckles ] And this one is Abby . She is so good . She , like , flies over every house and then when I wake up she tells me stories about how I can help people . I have one too . His name 's Stanley . - Is that your favorite ? - Yeah . My mom gave him to me . This is my favorite . Dobbs . He can fly . [ both laughing ] [ laughs ] What can Stanley do ? Um , he likes to boogie . [ both laughing ] - Thanks for helping us out . - You 're welcome . Lay off the milkshakes . - I 'll try . - Okay . No . This way . - This feels funny . - You 're telling me . I 'm an A 's fan . Get used to it . You 're a craps dealer , correct ? That 's what they tell me . Did you see this guy ? Maybe this little girl ? Maybe . Who 's asking ? [ sputters , chokes ] The man and the girl . Where did they go ? They said something about Philadelphia ! That 's all I heard ! [ coughs ] Come on ... My stomach hurts . Yeah , well , three milkshakes will do that to you . Hand me your backpack . I need my ducats for the bar car . - It 's not yours . - What 's not ? - The money . - What are you talking about ? It 's not . It 's mine . We only won because of me . [ chuckles ] No , you 're a minor . You couldn 't even have placed a bet if it wasn 't for me . And if it wasn 't for me , you wouldn 't have won . Okay , then , we 'll split it . - Gimme my half , then . - I can 't . What do you mean , " I can 't " ? Cough it up . All that Jack we just rolled . I gave it away . Again ? Slower . I 'm sorry . I 'm having a hard time ... I. gave. it away . You what ? To who ? Who 'd you give it to ? Jesse . Bo , that 's all we got . Without that , we ain 't got nothing . He doesn 't have anything either , Tate . He 's sick . How much ? Not the whole thing . Tell me you didn 't give 30k to a stranger , please . I kept a little . Here . [ scoffs ] Hey , you 're that kid , aren 't you ? - Mind your business , lady . - No , no . That girl ... that 's the girl on the television . The one that I saw . The Amber alert girl . I said mind your business , lady . Bo , that 's the kid 's name . It 's that Bo kid from the Amber alert . That 's who it is . Hey , pal . I don 't want any trouble . But you aren 't taking that kid . The hell I 'm not . First person that steps to me dies . - Got it ? - You don 't have a gun . Wanna try me ? [ gasps ] Hey ! Hey ! - Stop that kid ! - This way . That 's the Amber alert kid ! Stop that guy ! Hey ! Stop that guy ! Stop him ! [ people shouting ] Winter ... How they doing ? Everything okay ? They 're on foot . Police chatter 's picking up . Skouras is gonna know where they are . He 's gonna send someone . A mercenary . He 's gonna do whatever it takes . They 're not gonna make it to Philly . We need to get to them before Skouras does . What about Philly now ? I don 't really care about Philly right now , okay ? But Milton said he needed us to meet him there . Well , screw Milton , I got half of Jersey looking for me , and I ain 't going back to jail . No , right now we need to find a car . No , Tate , we 're not stealing a car . We 're not stealing a car . We 're just borrowing one . Red Sox hat . You sure about that ? Positive . He seemed like he was armed too , officer . - And the girl , Bo ? - He had her . Absolutely . - She seem traumatized ? - Terrified . Something I can help you with , buddy ? No , officer . Just a concerned citizen . You see what happened ? They get in any vehicle , drive away , anything like that ? [ giggles ] [ indistinct ] Okay . [ giggles ] - That is so good . That looks just like me . But you gotta sign it , right ? You gotta sign it . 'Cause this is a Bo original . " Bo Adams , " right there . Good , and then another " A. " " M ... " " S. " All right . Perfect . And then sign that one . - Okay . - Look . I made this bird . - So you made a bird ? - Sort of like a dragon . - It has wings on its head . - Where ... oh ! I wish he hadn 't taken her . He cares about her , Roman . Does he ? Ah ! [ squeals ] [ giggles ] I think he knew what would happen when the agency found out what Bo could do . How they 'd use her . How would they use her ? As a weapon . This is gonna be , like , a ... it 's gonna be , like , a secret code. okay ? Okay . " I ... " and then when I do it a second time , we 're gonna do " love ... " and the third one is " you . " Now you do , " How much ? " and then put your hands on my hand . And squeeze as hard as we can . How much ? As big as the moon and the stars and the whole world ! [ giggles ] [ footsteps receding ] [ radio noise ] - This car is so cool . - Hey , don 't do that . This isn 't a toy , all right ? Are we gonna be in trouble for taking this car ? You 're not . Thank you . - For what ? - Watching me . Yeah , well , I 'm not gonna be doing it for much longer , so don 't get used to it . I know . I 'm just thankful for what you 've already done . No problem . I have to go to the bathroom . Oh , you 're gonna have to hold it . - I can 't . - Well , isn 't there like a ... like , a cup or something you can use ? You can just go right there . What 's wrong with you ? Fine , I 'll pull over in the tall grass - and you can go there . - Gross ! No . Bo , the FBI is looking for me , okay ? The police are looking for me . I can 't just pull over and make a pit stop . - All right ? - I have to go ! Go inside and ask for a key . Keep your hat on . - And hurry . - Yes . And hurry . I know . All right . Yeah , that 's great . Go . Uh ! Uhh ! [ grunting ] - Where is the girl ? - [ panting ] [ grunts ] - Where 's the girl ? - What girl ? Relax sweetheart . You 'll be home soon . [ grunting ] Tate ! It 's burning ! It 's burning ! Go , go , get outta here ! It 's locked ! - Tate ! Tate ! - Go ! [ truck horn blares ] Go , Bo ! [ thuds ] You all right ? Yeah . There have been reports of an altercation between two men right before the fireball engulfed this gas station . - At this time ... - Still nothing from Krakauer . Police authorities have not made an official ... Don 't let her get hurt , Roman . We will bring you updates . The assets have been spotted . They 're heading northbound toward Philly . You 're two miles away . [ engine turns ] [ panting ] You okay ? Are you ? No , actually . I 'm not okay . I think I broke a rib , maybe two . You gave our money away . I 'm a fugitive . You 're an Amber alert . [ chuckles ] So no , I 'm not okay . Why didn 't you do one of your things when that guy came after you ? I was ... I was too scared . All right , kid . Look , I know you 're beat , but we only got about another 50 miles to Philly ... [ whoosh , bang ] No . - What 's wrong ? - Not now . Please , not now ! Tate , what 's wrong ? [ sighs ] We got a flat . [ siren approaches ] [ tires squeal ] Put your hands on top of your head ! Right now ! Hands on your head ! Do it ! Don 't even think about it ! Hands on your head now ! This is your final warning . Get on the ground ! Don 't do anything , Bo . Just stop . But they 're gonna take you back . Just do what they tell you . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be okay now , I promise . It 's all over . You have the right to remain silent . - Come on . - Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law . You have the right to an attorney . If you do not have an attorney , the state will provide one for you . The asset is recovered . The fugitive is in custody . Are you sure ? Positive . The police have her . I 'll have Lofton coordinate a transfer . She 's coming home . [ laughs ] - She 's coming home . Where are you taking her ? [ kicks seat ] I said where are you taking her ? [ laughs ] Hello , Mr. Tate . How are you ? [ laughing ] [ engine starts ] I understand you have a personal stake in the situation , Dr. Skouras , but you need to leave the work to actual professionals . Not mercenaries . Your people let them out of Atlantic City . Your mercenary blew up a gas station and endangered lives . Look , I 'm expanding the Amber alert to the tri-state area . You 're thinking traditionally , Agent Farrell . It 's not gonna work . - Yeah , why is that ? - Milton Winter . He 's cunning . He knows your move before you do . Well , then he knows you should back off and let me do my job . We 're dealing with a child , here . You keep thinking like that , you 'll never find her . We 'll stay here tonight , Mr. Tate . Change of clothing there . Food in the refrigerator . But don 't get comfortable . We move tomorrow , first light . We 'll communicate with this . Incoming only . And this is the next safe house . So this is how it 's gonna be ? Different place every night ? For now , yeah . I gotta say you did a whole lot better than I thought you would . Yeah , well , I like to keep expectations low . Yeah , no kidding . [ grunts ] [ both grunting ] [ laughs ] Be safe . [ door closes ] They got you , didn 't they ? Yeah , they got me . This afternoon my friend Bo came over for a playdate . We were playing hit the snake with the dice . And sometimes we missed , like that , sometimes we got it . It was like the best playdate ever . Oh , hi , mom . Hi . - It 's gonna be okay . - [ laughs ] How do you know ? Look what Bo gave me . [ quiet TV chatter ] We interrupt this program to bring you news in the search for Bo Adams , which is continuing across the tri-state area . Suspect William Tate ... [ tv turns off ]

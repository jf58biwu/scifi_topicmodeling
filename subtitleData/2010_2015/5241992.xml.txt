 Previously on Alphas ... What ... What are you doing here ? He isn 't coming , Dani . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Parish ... Dani , I have to take you into custody now . I want you to lay face down . Easy . Cameron ... You turned her in ! Please understand . If I 'd had any other option , I would have exercised it . She 's your kid ! You 're supposed to protect her . This isn 't the end , Dani . There 's an opportunity here . Yes , yes . There is a way out . She comes up with that brilliant idea herself , Doc ? Or did you head shrink that into her ? That 's uncalled for . Uncalled for ? Calm down ! You put your daughter 's head on the block . And I 'm out of order ? Relax ! Your father should 've never sent you back to Parish . Now , we 're getting out of here . No . I didn 't come back here for my father . Dani ... No . Cam ... This is my chance to do something good . I 'm standing on top of your bomb . Dani , you 're not supposed to be there . I can 't let you kill millions of people . My sweet Danielle , fighting for what she believes in . Goodbye . Run ! Dani ! Do not die . The choices can feel overwhelming . One always wants the best for one 's child . Please take your time . Hicks , you need anything ? No . You gotta eat , bro . We 're gonna order some food . Yeah , I 'm not hungry . Thanks . Hicks , you could try screaming . 'Cause , I ... You 're angry about Dani like I 'm angry about Anna . And the ... And the screaming , it 's cathartic . That 's why I do it in the mornings . Hicks , I could ... I could show ... I could show you how to do it . Gary , he really needs some time . Oh , how much time ? I don 't know . I 've barely slept . I just keep on picturing it , Dani dying . I know . She was holding my hand . What ? I felt everything she felt and how precious it all is and how fast . I just still can 't believe it . Me neither . Hey . How is he ? We 're giving him time . But we don 't know how much . The poor guy never slept last night . He was walking around my house till 3 : 00 in the morning . He 's strong . He 'll be okay . Anyway , let 's , uh ... Let 's get organized around this , okay ? Rosen 's head isn 't in it , so we need to stay on top of this investigation . No , Bill , it 's the weekend . Gary , that doesn 't matter anymore . Before we split up , we need copies of every document , every file ... You 're here . Well , this is our office . Yeah , and it 's my apartment , too . I just figured after what happened ... You 'd all take some time . And , what , it would be the perfect time for you to just sneak in here ? Nobody 's sneaking . DOD wants all the intel on the Parish organization . Oh , you mean Dr. Rosen 's intel ? Yes . His daughter 's death is a terrible tragedy . Now , I 'm going to rip that organization apart so they don 't hurt anybody else . So , what exactly do you need ? He needs to get out of here . We need everything . Starting in Dr. Rosen 's office . Cley , come on . This isn 't right . Rosen doesn 't trust him . Right . He wouldn 't let him go through his stuff like that . Guys , listen . I don 't agree with this either , okay ? I don 't like this , but obviously they can help us get to Parish . So , let 's give them what they need , but keep an eye on them . All right ? Let 's get to work . Gary ? We can use your help . Agent Bell . Okay , Agent Bell . Can you download all the digital files from the investigation ? Download ? That 's a waste of my ability . Hey , man , my guys can do it , but it would take them hours . You can do it in 10 minutes . Ten minutes ? I can do it quicker than that . Great . So , will you ? Oh , no . It 's lunch . I get pizza today . So , I 'll do it after . Maybe . Cley wanted an inventory on all the physical evidence we 've collected on Parish . Add it to the pile . Thanks . Can I help ? It 's okay . We 're almost done . I hate that we have to do this . Then maybe you should just go home . It 's a beautiful day . You don 't want to waste it . Okay . Hey . Hey . What are you doing here ? Well , I was looking for you . I wanted to see if you 're okay . I know you 're not okay . It 's just a ... Crappy day , huh ? Thank you . I can 't tell you how good it is to see you . Want to get some coffee or something ? Take me home . My parents are in New Jersey , at my uncle 's . Oh . Um ... Yeah . Okay . Is Dr. Rosen on the fifth floor ? I need to see him . Oh . Oh , no . No . He 's not that kind of doctor . No , you don 't understand . He has to help me . Do you know him ? Yeah , he 's my boss . But he 's not here right now . You work at the place that helps Alphas ? You 're not supposed to know about us . You should ... You should go away and then come back another time . No , I can 't . I can 't come back , okay ? Here , take him . No . Take him ! No , I don 't ... No , no , no . Please . He 's special . Okay , okay , but I 'm not gonna take him ! Hey ! Hey , don 't , no ! Uh , oh , oh . I can 't take it ! Where are you going ? Oh . Oh . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Hey . We 're gathering all our information on Parish , just to get everyone up to speed . Do you mind ? Can I get you anything ? No , thanks . You sure ? Oh , geez . Between you and Harken ... We 're all here for you . Whatever you need . Your download 's done . Nina , wait . There is something I want you to do . Push me . Make me forget . I can 't do this . I can 't be like this . So push me and then I 'll forget her . Cam , I can 't do that . No , you mean you won 't . I know how you feel ... No , you don 't ! I know how much she loved you . Just go . Is that a baby ? What the hell ... Gary ! Gary , whose baby is that ? Uh , oh . I don 't know . Some lady gave him to me downstairs , told me to take care of him . I already looked up how . A lady ? What ... What lady ? I don 't know . She didn 't tell me her name . She didn 't tell me his name either . But I think he looks like a Kyle or a Benjamin . Gary , what ... What are you talking about ? Talking about what just happened to me , Bill , downstairs . I have to use a " steady rhythmic soothing motion . " Look , look , look . Look , look , look . Look , look , look . Look , Bill . It works . Look , look , look . I 'm sorry , sir . No entry . I understand . Thank you , sir . You know , Homeland Security 's already searched the place . Yes , I 'm aware of that . I ... I want to make sure they haven 't missed anything . Here you go , sir . Thank you . Please state your name for the record . Lee Rosen . Lee , thank you for coming in today . On behalf of our entire department , please accept our condolences . Thank you . I know this is a difficult time for you , but we find that recollections are most accurate within 24 hours after an event . I understand . We are here to review the course of events that culminated in the act of domestic terrorism in Weehawken , New Jersey , and resulted in a number of casualties , including the death of government informant Danielle Sara Rosen . Dr. Rosen , for the record , who do you hold responsible for Danielle 's death ? Excuse me ? Who do you hold responsible for the death of your daughter ? Are you all right ? Yeah . Okay . I made this . I heated it up , okay , and I tried it . It 's gross . Gary , I need you to track her . Gary , I need you to do it now . Yeah , Bill , I already did . I did that once . She goes into the alleyway , and then you can 't see her anymore . So there 's no way to contact her . Gary , listen , I need you to do a face grab ... Bill , I know what you need me to do . But I can 't , I only have two hands . I 'm trying to give Benjamin or Kyle his food here . Gary . Okay , I 'll look for her . Thank you . Are you sure she said she can 't come back ? Yeah , and that he 's very special and that he should be here . That 's why she brought him here , because he must be an Alpha . I wonder what his ability is . He 's probably gonna fly off somewhere . No , Bill . Come on . Even Alpha babies can 't fly . Can you ... Can you fly ? Can you fly ? I 'm kidding . I 'm joking with you . What is this , Daddy Day Care ? No . I 'm not his daddy . Agent Bell , you get those downloads for me ? No , because I have to feed him and then I have to burp him . And then I 'll probably have to clean up after him . Status on Parish ? The status is we 're all over this . Oh , so you 're looking for him , huh ? Hell , yeah . Probably not gonna find him here . Hicks , you know how long it takes to get 19 federal agencies up and moving ? We 're bringing in the big guns , but it takes some time to get the big guns rolling . Rosen warned you about Parish a year ago . And then he almost killed millions of people and that 's what it finally takes to light a fire under the government 's ass . And you think you 're gonna come here and start giving us orders ? No way Rosen 's gonna take this ! Cam ! Rosen invited us . He reached out to me . What ? He told me I had free access to all the intel . The investigation is not gonna be run by this team . Rosen agreed to that . Son of a bitch . Hicks ! Wait , Cley , what are you talking about ? Okay , yeah . I found her . Someone tagged a photo . Somewhere tropical . Yeah , we 're gonna need a name , Gary . Bill , come on . Your hands are too big . Don 't . - Don 't . Get out of there . - All right , all right . Yeah , Magda Ryan . It 's somewhere sunny , Bill , like Bermuda or Bahamas . We got a name . We also have the parents . They 're waiting outside . They 're here ? All right , all right . Oh , thank God ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Mr. And Mrs ... Uh , Kessler . I 'm Brian , this is Jane . And that 's Adam , our son . He doesn 't look like an Adam . - Thank you for looking after him . - One second , please . We need to work this thing out . What do you mean " work this thing out " ? Jane Kessler . And , uh , Brian Kessler . We came as soon as we knew Magda took him . Is that this woman here ? Yes , that 's her . She is so fired . I know we have to , but she 's been so good with him . She took him without our permission , then she abandoned him . She thought she was helping . You believe this ? All right , why did she bring him here ? She watched that video of the doctor talking about Alphas . Lee Rosen . You know the one where he 's in front of the Senate committee ? Yes , I am aware . She was obsessed with the idea that Adam was one of those people . One of " those people " ? Alphas . She kept on pressuring us to get Dr. Rosen to examine him . How did you find us ? We found this address in her room . What exactly is this place anyway ? We 're government consultants . We don 't want to get her in trouble . We just want our son . Okay . That was , um ... Good . It was very good . Yeah , that was great . Yeah . Thank you for coming over . I felt a bit alone . So , I appreciate it . You 're welcome . I mean , not ... Oh . Yeah , I ... Um , do you feel like some dinner ? Sure . Um ... You first . Right . Of course . After Danielle 's arrest , she was returned to , uh ... To Stanton Parish as a covert operative for the Department of Defense . Her assignment was to provide intelligence for you , for your department , uh , in exchange for a pardon of her crimes . Then you were in support of that agreement ? Yes , I was . When Danielle returned to the Parish organization as a covert operative , she was confident that he would not question her loyalty . She 'd been a disciple of his , so to speak . Yes , so to speak . Dr. Rosen , in your opinion , how does a man like Stanton Parish attract so many followers ? What did your daughter see in him ? Stanton Parish is a master manipulator . Uh , he 's , quite frankly , a sociopath with some very charismatic personality . He preys upon people , who , uh ... Who , for whatever reason , are looking for a purpose . In their life , and a sense of belonging , particularly those who feel they have lost some sort of connection , uh , with their friends or family . You don 't look like an Adam . I wish that you could tell me your name . I 'm ... I 'm Gary Bell . You should know that , even though you can 't talk , unless that 's your Alpha ability . Talking baby . I 'm kidding . I do that . Oh . Oh , oh . Gary ? What ? Let 's go . Parents are here to pick up the kid . What ? No ! Time to go . No , Bill , we don 't even know if they are his parents . The birth certificates are legitimate , okay ? I looked online . No , Bill . They can fake birth certificates . Don 't do this to me today , Gary . It 's probably fake , Bill . You don 't know ! No , no , no , Bill ! No ! No ! Bill , don 't do that . Gary , what is wrong with you ? Don 't do this ! Get out ! Gary ! Gary ! No ! Just get out ! Stay out ! Gary , what the hell is wrong with you ? There 's nothing wrong with me , Bill ! They 're not taking him ! Gary . Nina ? They 're not taking him , Bill . Gary , come on , now , open the door . This is so not the time ! Maybe we should just break in . I don 't want to set him off . I mean , this is weird , even for Gary . Gary ? We know you 're concerned about the baby , but you can 't keep him from his parents . Gary , you can check the IDs . Yeah , Bill , I already did check their IDs . Brian and Jane Kessler . But they only have driver 's licenses . Yeah . That 's real suspicious , huh ? Yeah . It is suspicious , Bill , because that 's all they have . I couldn 't find anything else . There 's no bank accounts . No credit cards . And there 's no pictures of them with the baby . Come on , Gary . The lady gave him to me , so ... And then she told me to take care of him . That 's what I 'm gonna do . I 'm gonna take care of him . Something is off , really off . Looks like you 've got a situation . Yeah . Nothing we can 't handle . Listen , I 'm sorry we imposed on you today . But we 're done here for now . What does that mean ? Starting tomorrow , your offices will become our base of operation . " Grand Central " for breaking the Parish organization . I thought you said we were off of the investigation ? I said you weren 't in charge . We still need your help and expertise . We 're all after the same thing , aren 't we ? See you soon . There 's , uh , something with aliens at 8 : 00 . Or , no , a chick flick at 9 : 15 . Obviously , you 're into the aliens . Obviously , but I 'm willing to sacrifice . John , you shouldn 't have to sacrifice . Seriously , I 'm fine with whatever . John . You deserve better than fine . We both do . Listen . I think , I don 't know ... I think we just built it up too much . We just need to get past the first time , that 's all . We do ? Yeah , absolutely . I mean , it wasn 't terrible . Oh , God ! Uh , look , I just ... I mean , to me , it felt like you were far away . Are you sorry that ... No , I wanted this . I wanted to be with you . I guess I expected it to be different this time . What do you mean ? I was 18 my first time . And , when it happened , I felt so out of control . Just so overwhelmed by the sensations that I just completely shut down . It 's just always been like that . Hey , Rachel , we 'll get there . And you 'll feel comfortable . You kept your shirt on . You don 't want to see my scars . No . You 're wrong . I do . My ex , um , she tried to be there for me while I was recovering . She said she couldn 't stomach it . Is that how she put it ? Kind of hard to forget . Mmm ... Well ... I think you are beautiful . Papa ! What are you doing home ? Your uncle got on my nerves . This is John . Uh ... Sir . I 'll go check on her . I 'm sorry . Wow , thank you . I didn 't ... You left me all alone out there with your dad . - I 'm sorry . - Rachel ! I am leaving the house ! I 'm going shopping ! I 'm going for two hours ! No . No , it 's fine . Because you know what ? I think he liked me . Shut up . We only have two hours . What do you think you 're doing here ? Making sure they haven 't missed anything important . Taking inventory . Yeah . Yeah , in a word . Dani 's paintings and her belongings . I want to make sure they 're protected . Wow . You want to protect her things . What are you doing here , Cameron ? Cley 's back at our office , rifling through our stuff ! You 're seriously gonna trust this to him ? Yes . Yes , for now , I 'm letting the experienced authorities make all the decisions . No . You 're the experienced authority . Yeah , and look where my expertise has led us ! What ? You 're just gonna hand this entire thing over to him ? Parish killed Dani ! I know that . You think I need you to tell me that ? She 's my daughter ! She was . Now look at you , just sitting there , not doing anything to find her killer . Well , where the hell do you think I should be ? Gary would never harm your baby . He 's just trying to protect him . Protect him from what ? That doesn 't make any sense . Gary is autistic . It 's very hard for him to make connections with people . But , for some reason , he 's found a connection with Adam . He 's been able to hold him . He 's been very caring . Which is very unusual for Gary , believe me . This is what I 'm thinking , what if your nanny was right ? What if Adam has some sort of ability that 's affecting Gary ? He 's an Alpha ? We don 't believe in that . Okay . We 'll call Dr. Rosen ... No ! Rosen 's able to reach Gary . He 'll be able to see whether there 's something that 's affecting him . Absolutely not . We don 't want that man anywhere near our child . That 's how this whole thing began . Fair enough . Why don 't you go take a seat in my office ? Sit tight . We 'll get you and your son out of here . You got a half hour or we 're calling the police . All right , we need to split them up and ask some more questions . You ready to do your thing ? Oh , yeah . The funny thing , Mr. Kessler , is we can 't seem to find any record of you or your wife . No home records , no loans . What does that have to do with this ? Just get my son out of that room ! I 'm afraid I 'm not gonna be able to do that just yet . What 's he talking to Brian about ? Just relax and tell me the truth . This tea is terrible . And I love your perfume . Are you the baby 's parents ? No . He doesn 't have real parents . Can I get some cream ? Who 's the lady who brought the baby to Gary ? She took care of the kid at the lab . Your friend 's in big trouble . Either knock down that door or I call the police . You wanna call the police ? Call them . Go right ahead . They do stuff with genetics or something . I think they 've got four other babies now . Who sent you ? Mr. Murphy called and said , " Get the kid out of here . " No muss , no fuss . " But if things get tricky , " show them who they 're dealing with . " You don 't want to call ? I will . Yeah . I 'm one of those people . Bastard . I don 't think so . Bitch . Do your thing . He 's holding the kid . Give him to me . No . No way ! Have it your way . Go to sleep . Bitch . Yeah , you see ? I told you . I was right . Yeah , Gary , you were right . They never listen to me . Doctor Rosen , if you will . Please turn your attention to the final event in Weehawken . After the detonation of the voltaic grenades , several electrical towers were destroyed . All of the lights in the area had , uh ... Had gone out . Danielle was in the direct path of ... Of the blast . Dani . Um ... Her injuries were quite severe . Dani ? Dani , look at me . Look at me . Dani , I love you . And , uh ... No , no , no . She expired . It 's my responsibility . Whatever happens to Cameron or Dani or anyone , it 's my responsibility . You shouldn 't have to carry that alone . Yes , I should . Lee . I 'm so sorry to have brought you here . It 's all right , Nina . Where 's Gary ? He 's in the lab . Gary , you have a very high level of vasopressin in your bloodstream . Oh , that doesn 't sound good . It 's all right , Gary . It 's nothing to worry about . It 's a hormone that , uh , increases the instinct to protect one 's child . It 's typically found in high levels in new fathers . I 'm not his father . I only just met him today . Yes , I know . I just believe that Adam here is ... No , Benjamin . Or Kyle . Well , whatever his name is has the ability to induce production of the hormone in anyone who 's nearby , in close proximity or in contact with him . It doesn 't necessarily have to be the birth parent , either . He can inspire ... Inspire what all babies need , care and protection . Hey , Bill . Good to see you , Doc . You , too . How 'd it go at the laboratory ? Well , they busted everyone . Of course , no one 's talking . They 're still looking for Magda , though . Hmm . Are the other babies all right ? Seem to be . They placed them all in secure foster homes . Oh , I should probably have a look at them , too . Gary , this is a vasopressin antagonist . It will reduce the concentration in your bloodstream very quickly . I have to drink this ? Yes , please . No , just hold your breath . Oh , it 's filthy ! It 's not filthy , Gary . It 's ... Magda must have taken that , right ? Unless she felt like this was the safest place for him . Yeah . That makes sense . Gary , you were incredible . Huh . You protected him when we almost gave him away . Yeah , I was incredible . I protected him . - Gary , may I ? - Oh . Oh , yeah , you have to be careful . Hey , little one . - Hi there . Can you squeeze my finger ? - Sweet little kid . He had a rough day . He 's doing fine . He was lucky . He won 't remember it . Well , hopefully . He 'll learn young to put all the rough stuff behind him and move on with life . Right ? - Right , little guy ? - You have a go . Come here . Right ? Press on his back . Hey , hey , hey . Oh . Whoa ! Better ? I think I figured out what your Alpha ability is . But we should keep practicing . Uh , isn 't your dad gonna be home soon ? I don 't care . What a day . No whining , Bill . We can only have one baby in the house . Are you sure you 're okay with this ? Are you kidding me ? I 'm still in shock that you are . Well , you know , sometimes life can be rough . But you just have to grab the good stuff when it happens , right ? Oh , and everyone thinks you 're such a tough guy . This is just until we find a safe place for him . We have a safe place . We don 't know anything about this kid , okay ? So we 're still gonna have to take that stuff , you know . No , I know . I know . Just look at him , Bill . He 's perfect . I know you blame me for all of this , Cameron . Well , I do , too . I had her in my arms . I could 've stopped her , but I let her go . Whatever you 're feeling right now , we did not kill her . Someone else did . He used her and then he killed her when she got in his way . Do you know that if Cley catches Parish , he 'll put him in prison ? He doesn 't deserve to go to prison . No . No , he doesn 't . I 'm gonna need your help .

 Previously on " the 100 " ... Where 's finn ? Looking for you . I count 26 . These people don 't look like warriors . What have you done with them ? Your friends were not here . [ gunfire ] man : You need to go . You sent an assassin into One of my villages . Later we will talk . In the meantime , Your friend will be used to send a message . Uhh ! Leave or die . Mark this one for the cerberus program . First dose is the worst . Woman : I feel like he 's a reaper . [ groaning ] no . Now we take him home . There 's a containment breach . Even a little radiation could kill them . Tsing : If we were to circulate Maya 's blood through your system ... I could make her better . They exposed her to radiation on purpose . The standard treatment sucks . Jasper : Those grounders ? I won 't leave the others behind . What choice do we have ? I volunteer . I 'm impressed , jasper , And deeply grateful . You saved us , right ? It 's the least we could do . Uhh . [ gasping ] Help me . Open the door ! 4 minutes and 10 seconds . We 're making progress . Keenan : Please . It hurts . She 's in pain . I 'm bringing her in . Whoa , whoa . Do you trust her not to talk ? [ keenan screaming ] Might as well get a full reading . [ keenan screaming ] " the blood of the forty-seven Could be our permanent solution . " That 's what you said . Science takes time , cage . There are dead ends and blind alleys On the path to every breakthrough . You call that a blind alley ? She 's one of us . No . Of course not . I call that sacrifice . For the greater good . Keenan : Open the door ! [ screaming ] [ screaming ] [ indistinct chatter ] Man : Civilian check-in will take place at 0900 hours . All civilians must be accounted for by your station supervisor . There has to be another way . There 's not . Commander 's message was clear . Leave or die . We have 16 hours . You think we should just give up ? This is not our home . It 's theirs . Because kane went looking for peace , He has given us a chance to move on Without bloodshed . And where 's marcus now ? In prison still ? You 're just gonna leave him there ? Like the kids in mount weather . If we run , who 's gonna rescue them ? You weren 't there , abby . I saw them . Warriors trained since childhood To fight and die for their cause . And as we speak , they are marching on this camp . And trust me when i tell you The right choice is to live So that we can come back and fight another day . [ metal clanking ] Ma 'am , sir . The people are on edge . A word from their chancellor Could go a long way . Of course . Byrne : Unfortunately , sir , Dr. Griffin is still in command . Until a vote can be taken , Or you willingly transfer your authority . What are you waiting for ? I 'm not ready to march our people Into the desert , thelonious . Not until we try to find another way . We 'll talk to them together . [ indistinct chatter ] [ chatter stops ] Chancellor ? Listen up . By now you 've all heard the rumor , And unfortunately , it 's true . [ crowd murmuring ] the grounders are coming . We have a difficult decision to make . Thankfully , chancellor jaha Has found his way back to us , And we 're discussing all options . But to be safe ... You need to pack . Now . Whatever you can carry . We may need to leave at a moment 's notice . Where will we go ? I don 't know , is the answer . But i heard of a place . A city of light . It 's across the dead zone . Man : What makes you think we 'll make it there ? Because we made it here . I have faith , and right now , Given the alternative , That 's good enough for me . Not for us . If we leave here , what happens to our People in mount weather ? As your mother said ... That is a very difficult decision to make . But the time has come For each and every one of us to ask : Is this how the story of our people ends ? Did we come all this way just to die tomorrow ? Because if we 're not gone By the time that sun rises , That is exactly what will happen . [ crowd murmuring ] No decision 's been made . In the meantime , please report to your station supervisor And gather emergency supplies . [ indistinct chatter ] Hey , where have you been ? In the dropship . You need to come back with me right now . Why ? What 's happened ? I 'll explain on the way . Bring a med kit . Meet me at raven 's gate . This is my fault . The grounders are attacking because of me . The grounders are attacking Because that 's what they do . Go with bellamy . Your mom said no decision has been made . If that changes , i 'll let you know . [ growling ] It 's ok . It 's ok . He 's been restrained . [ growling ] I can 't believe we 're back here again . Can you help him ? [ growling ] I don 't know . [ growling ] I knew mount weather controlled the reapers . [ growling ] I had no idea they were creating them . [ snarling ] If they can do that to lincoln ... What are they doing to our friends ? [ metal clanking ] [ growling ] [ music playing ] Harper : I 'm tired of puking . Miller : I 'm tired of being a human pincushion . Look , i know this sucks , but As long as it seems like we 're cooperating , We 're buying ourselves time . Time for what ? I say if we 're gonna die in here , We might as well die trying to escape . We 've been over this . After clarke left , There is no escape . We just have to hold on long enough For her to find a way to get us out . What if she doesn 't find a way ? What if she didn 't make it out ? What if that 's just a story they 're telling us To hide the fact that they killed her ? Then no one 's coming for us And we 're doing exactly what they want us to do . Jasper ... You know you 've thought it , too . All right , then . We escape . No . We find the truth . How do we do that ? We 're criminals , right ? So , let 's be criminals . [ screaming ] He 's convulsing . So , what does it mean ? What happened to his leg ? I shot him . Clarke , he 's lost a lot of blood . [ lincoln growling ] Can you shine the light on his neck ? Needle marks . You think he 's been drugged ? Clarke : Maybe . Lincoln ! [ lincoln growling ] David : Is it true ? We 're evacuating ? I just gave the order . My son is still inside that mountain . David , i know , and believe me , If there was any other way , i would 've taken it . But i swear to you , As soon as we find someplace safe , We 'll figure out a way to get them . I 'm not going anywhere . Yes , you are . The guard is leading the evacuation . If you stay , you 'll be disobeying orders . Then order me to stay . The other parents with missing kids Aren 't going anywhere , either . I can protect them . I 'd be ordering you to die . How is that gonna help your son ? Abby , please . You got your job back . Don 't make me abandon mine . Sergeant , pack your things . Report to major byrne . The grounders attack at dawn . I want every man , woman , and child Out of this camp by then . Is that clear ? Is that clear ? Tsing : Based on these results , Treatments with the blood of the forty-seven Will never be enough to get us to the surface . Cage : Why are you saying that like it 's good news ? Because it 's made me start over . If treatments using their blood Give us temporary immunity , How do we extend that immunity forever ? By going to the source of their blood . Bone marrow . What would happen to the donors ? There 's 382 of us . That 's roughly 8 procedures for each of the kids . You didn 't answer my question . Everyone of the forty-seven would die . He 'll never go for that . You have to convince him . Cage ... We could be living on the ground Within a month . All of us . If your theory is correct . I 'll worry about the science . You worry about your father . We have to stop the bleeding and get the bullet out . Hold his leg down . [ lincoln groaning ] Shh , shh . Rawr ! Aah ! [ growling ] I 'll get some more . [ groaning ] O. Once the drug Is out of his system , he 'll be ok . You can 't protect me from this one , big brother . [ lincoln screaming in distance ] Shh , shh , shh . [ muffled scream ] Nyko . What are you doing here ? Our scouts have already arrived . The commander is true to her word . If you do not leave , you will die . Octavia , you saved my life from the reapers . Now let me save yours . It 's what lincoln would have wanted . [ lincoln screaming in distance ] What was that ? That was lincoln . Your mom would be proud . My mom would know how to save him . Bellamy , don 't . He 's lincoln 's friend and their healer . [ grunting ] Clarke : He 's seizing again . What is that ? Wait ! Back off . Right now . Yu gonplei ste odon . It 's what they say before death . He 's not trying to heal him . He 's trying to kill him . Nyko ? Is it true ? Yes . Death is the only way . Hold on . There could be A way to bring him back . None that i 've ever seen . We have to go . The camp 's leaving . Yu ! We have to stop- - Get off him ! You slaughtered my people . Elders . Children . Innocents . Octavia : Nyko , you 're killing him . Nyko : Blood must have blood ! Get out of the way ! Bellamy , you 're not shooting him ! No ! Aah ! [ electricity crackling ] Lincoln . He 's not breathing . Clarke : His heart 's stopped . Move . [ inhales ] He was dead . How did you do that ? You 've tried bringing reapers back before ? And they died like this ? What is it ? I know how to stop the attack . [ metal clanking ] Clarke : He 's stable for now . We should go . You ready ? Even if you can save lincoln ... He won 't be the same . The things he 's done ... They 'll stay with him . We don 't know that . Yes , we do . Lincoln 's savable ... And so are you . Now , come on . We have to hurry . Today , monty . I 'm going as fast as i can . Relax . Maya 's decontaminating the surveillance room . No one 's watching . We got this . If we can get that door open . [ beep ] Ye of little faith . That 's my boy . Come on , let 's move . Go , go , go , go , go . Harper , watch the hall . Why do i have to watch the hall ? Monty 's good with computers . Miller 's a thief . Why can 't you watch the hall ? I 'm the mastermind . Just go watch the hall . Come on . What do we have here ? It 's password protected . We 'll see about that . And they said we wouldn 't amount to anything . [ indistinct chatter ] Man on p.A. : Initiated evacuation plan 2a . Report to your station supervisor For further instruction . You made the right decision , abby . Mom . Where have you been ? We 're leaving . I know how to stop the attack . What are you talking about ? We haven 't been able to negotiate with the grounders Because we haven 't had anything to offer them . The biggest threat they face is from the reapers . I think we may be able to eliminate that threat For them once and for all . How ? Abby . You can 't serious- - [ indistinct chatter ] They 're here . Man on p.A. : Initiated evacuation plan 2a . Report to your station supervisor for further instructions . Clarke : They 're not attacking yet , Which means we still have time . Abby : We have two hours till dawn . Let me talk to the commander . She was anya 's second . Maybe she 'll listen . We don 't even know if the commander 's here . Yes , we do . Nyko told us . You have to at least let her try . Abby , we 're wasting time . Give me the authority now . Hold on . Clarke , You said that lincoln is Going through withdrawal . We don 't even know what he 's withdrawing from . The detox alone could kill him . That 's where you come in . And if i can 't save him ? That 's not an option . We are risking everything on a bluff , abby . We have an out . We have a way to save the lives of our people . Not all of them . We will come back to save the kids Inside mount weather . We all know that 's not gonna happen . Abby , this has gone on long enough . If you do not give the order to begin the exodus , You are killing us all . I 'm sorry . I can 't give that order . Abby ... Give the order . No . I ... Am the elected Chancellor of the ark . And i am not gonna let you risk The lives of my people . Do you understand ? I 'm going to ask you once again- - Give the order to begin the exodus . No . Are you through yet ? Jaha : Sergeant miller ? Major byrne . I am relieving dr . Griffin of her command . Place these three into custody But make sure that they are ready To leave with the rest of us Within the hour . Right now ! Major , Or the blood of everyone in this camp Will be on your hands , too . Abby : Major byrne , sergeant miller , Put chancellor jaha in the stockade . Yes , ma 'am . Everything we did to survive ... You 're just throwing it all away . Why ? Because i have faith , too . In my daughter . [ metal clanking ] Thank you . I 'll send a guard detail with you . No . They 'll see it as a threat . I have to do this on my own . Finn will take you to lincoln . If you 're wrong ... All of us are gonna die . Yes . [ gasps ] Guys . Ha ! Wow . [ keys clacking on keyboard ] Hey , i got something . Me , too . Damn , i 'm good . They 're alive . If you so much as look at her the wrong way , I will slit your throat . You 're the one who burned 300 of my warriors alive . You 're the one who sent them there to kill us . Do you have an answer for me , Clarke of the sky people ? I 've come to make you an offer . This is not a negotiation . I can help you beat the mountain men . Go on . Hundreds of your people Are trapped inside mount weather . Kept in cages . Their blood is used as medicine . How do you know this ? Because i saw them . My people are prisoners there , too . I was one of them . Lies . No one escapes the mountain . I did . With anya . We fought our way out together . Another lie . Anya died in the fire . You killed her . She told me you were her second . I 'm sure she 'd want you to have this . We don 't know it 's hers . Lexa : Anya was my mentor , Before i was called to lead my people . Did she die well ? Yes . By my side , Trying to get a message to you . What message ? The only way to save both our people Is if we join together . Those who are about to die will say anything . I 'm still waiting for an offer , clarke . The mountain men are turning your people into reapers . I can turn them back . Impossible . I 've done it . With lincoln . That traitor is the reason My village was slaughtered by your people . You say you can turn reapers back into men ? Yes . Then prove it . Show me lincoln . [ door creaks ] What are we doing out here ? I told you to trust me . Son . [ exhales ] It worked . It 's ok . You got the same treatment i did . Go ahead . I 'd forgotten the smells . This is where we belong . [ inhales ] You always told me that the surface Was our true home . Not some concrete coffin . We have to go back now . We only have a few minutes . Come on . Dad ? Don 't play with me , son . What will it take to stay ? Bone marrow . All that they have . They 'll die so that we can finally live . [ inhales ] [ exhales ] This is our world . We deserve this . We are the keepers of history . What we 've done to the outsiders Has corrupted our legacy . I can 't go down that road any further . Dad . Dad . Please . The answer is no . [ thunder ] [ metal clanking ] Oh , thank god . Where 's clarke ? Trying to stop a war . Pupils are unresponsive . Tie off his arm . Tight as you can . Thanks to the supplies your brother found , Lincoln might have a chance . What 's that ? This will bring down his fever . Abby : Hold him down ! [ grunting ] [ lincoln groaning ] Clarke : What 's happening ? Why isn 't it working ? Abby : His heart stopped . You 're their healer ? Tilt his head back . Pull his chin down to open his airway . [ whispering ] come on . This way . [ whispering ] come on . You 're stopping . What 's wrong ? I 'm sorry . He 's gone . No , it 's not possible . You 're wrong ! Octavia . [ octavia crying ] Octavia : Come back . Octavia : Lincoln . I 'll kill them all . Please . You don 't have to do this . You lied . And you 're out of time . [ electricity humming ] Hit him again . [ electricity humming ] [ gasping ] Oh , lincoln . [ whispering ] octavia . If alpha 's on the ground , maybe other stations are , too . You 're from alpha , right ? My dad was chief guard . He sure loved having a thief for a kid . Hey . You 're a great thief . These are the engineering schematics for this whole place . If there 's a way out , we 're gonna find it . Guys . Harper didn 't show for breakfast . You guys seen her ? Not since dante 's office . So , where the hell is she ? [ whimpering ] please . No . Please . Please . Don 't worry . This won 't hurt . The hip has the largest marrow pocket . We 'll begin the aspiration there . I don 't need to know the details . Just do it . [ whimpering , gasping ] Your father will come around , cage . What if he doesn 't ? I just want to go home . Cage : I know . So do we . [ whimpering ] i just want to go- - [ screaming ] Lincoln 's recovery was ... Impressive No one 's ever survived such a fate before . It 's not complicated , really . We just have to keep them alive long enough For the drug to leave their system . I know we can do the same for others . You may have your truce . Thank you . I just need one thing in return . Tell me . Deliver me the one you call finn . Our truce begins ... With his death .

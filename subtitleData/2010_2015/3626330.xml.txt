 Got your power . Isn 't that interesting ? I know why you can 't kill . Hiro nakamura said you 're going to die alone , And it 's haunting you . We all need people who understand us . Care for us . - Who 's she ? The love of my life . - He just shows up . - And he 's stalking you ? - He does seem ... - Obsessed ? I had to act , to protect you , to get you away from him . By kidnapping me ? You can never cheat the past . It 's bad , always ! Everything is connected . If you wanna change one thing , that 's all you do . I 've come back in time to save charlie . And this time , I will defeat the brain man . There 's something I want you to see . It 's so magical , so beautiful . Just let me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you right back to california . Did they really think That they were gonna get away with it ? Forever ? That we would just never find out ? We shouldn 't have done it . I need time to grieve without being reminded why . Do you wanna talk about it ? About what ? Life among the carnies , the death of your father- - I mean , either one of those would be enough to mess me up . I don 't think I 'd know where to start . I just ... Think it 's one of those things I have to figure out by myself . Listen . I 'm not gonna pretend to know What you 're going through right now . But I want you to know that I 'm here for you . If you need anything . Anything at all . I have this review lesson thing . I moved it to bapst hall , I have no idea where that is . East quad . Clear across campus . Of course it is . [ sighs ] [ frustrated sigh ] Excuse me . Is this seat taken ? How 's it coming ? It 's ready . Now remember , It 'll only work in the hands of one of us . Luckily , you have hiro and ando now . You sure I can 't change your mind ? I broke a promise to a girl . I need to make amends . Well , then I guess this is it . In our lives , when is it ever ? Thanks , mohinder . Good luck . You too , noah . [ door closing ] Well , gentlemen , I guess it 's up to us . Hiro ! [ whispering ] [ clattering utensils ] Hello , carp . Adam monroe ? But you are dead . Am I dead ? That 's for the judge to decide . - Judge ? - All rise . The honorable judge kaito nakamura presiding . Be seated . The world versus hiro nakamura , your honor . The what versus what ? Excuse me , is this professor yanno 's review session ? Nope . Study group . Ready to brainstorm ? What the hell are you doing here ? I came to learn . How 'd you sleep ? The dress is a gift . If you want to change into something- - A gift ? You kidnapped me , brought me to ... [ scoffs ] I don 't even know where we are because you won 't tell me . You 're right , I 'm sorry . I never meant to upset you . I 'll take you back home . Straight away . What ? What are you smiling about ? Your face . Just now ... It brought me back to when I broke your record player . [ sighs ] samuel ... You had this one song You played over , and over , and over . And I was just- - I was just kidding around But I broke the arm . - [ sighs ] - remember ? Yes . I remember . Good . 'cause there 's something I still want you to see . The only thing I 'm interested in seeing Is my own front door . But first , let me get you something to eat . And then you 'll be rid of me for good , I promise . This is how it always starts . Breakfast becomes lunch , lunch becomes dinner , Dinner turns into drinks , and then ... I fixed your record player . I broke it and then I fixed it . I know what I 've done wrong , and I know how to make it good . With scotch tape , and wire hangers , And loads of good intentions . Fine . Something to eat . Then you take me home . Good . Great . He has a brain tumor . In the parietal lobe . The doctors in japan said it 's inoperable , but- - We may not have a choice . Please , doctor , he 's my best friend . I can 't just- - - wait here . We 'll find out what 's happening . Please help him . It is our intent to prove that the defendant abused his power To bend space and time selfishly and repeatedly For his own personal gain . And with a blatant disregard for the consequences On the space-time continuum . This is some bad dream or tumor hallucination . Let the record show that the defendant Fails to recognize the authority of this court . This isn 't a court , it 's a diner . Perhaps your honor could enter a plea For the defendant if he refuses ? Mr. Monroe , please call your first witness . The prosecution calls kimiko nakamura . And ando masahashi . You know how much I would love to kill you ? Listen ... I know you must hate me . You killed my father ! Nathan ... It seems like a lifetime ago . But I 'm a little off my game . You 're gonna help me get it back . Says who ? Says this . Your face showing up in ink wasn 't my choice . It 's destiny showing me my desire . And you actually thought that I would- - Relax . They told me I needed connection . A friend . I don 't want to be alone . And somehow you 're supposed to help me . I wouldn 't help you if my life depended on it . It 's not your life you should be concerned about . Gretchen . Let 's get this over with . You don 't have to hurt gretchen . I promise that you will see her again Just as soon as you help me answer my question . Here is what I 've been thinking . You and me . We got a lot in common . We 're both adopted ... Abandoned by parents who didn 't want us . And raised by parents who didn 't understand us . My parents understand me just fine . Stop lying to yourself . Both of our dads were cold-blooded killers . Which is ironic , because you and I ... [ writing on chalkboard ] cannot be killed . I get it . Okay , we have a few arbitrary things in common . What is your point ? My point is they 're not arbitrary . They 're formative . The basic building blocks of our lives , And we have the same blocks . Yet , here we are ... Content college co-ed , And me . How did we end up so different ? You want to know what the difference is ? You 're a psychopath . Mystery solved . [ grunts ] You think this is a game ? This is my life . You 're supposed to help me . Or don 't you care how many filets I slice your ... Roommate into ? If you 're not gonna contribute , I 'll just have to take the answers from your head . You 're gonna slice my head open again ? I 've evolved way beyond that . My friend lydia gave me a much more precise instrument . She could read someone just by touching them . See into the very depths of their soul . Of course , her methods were A little hyper-erotic , but ... Ah , what the hell . [ exhales ] It is college , isn 't it ? The dress suits you . What 's that ? A strawberry milkshake . Your favorite . Well ... That was a long time ago . How about this one ? The last time I crashed in your dorm room , We talked all night . Among other things . We talked about your dream home . That was the tequila talking . " a peaceful cottage surrounded By nature and happiness . " You 're such a romantic . Actually , that 's something I 've admired about you . But there comes a time when you have to realize That you 're never gonna have that cottage . Says who ? Can you honestly tell me you don 't you look back At our time together with a hint of fondness ? [ chuckling ] Mm . What 's your prognosis ? Not good . [ indistinct chatter ] [ speaking in japanese ] The witness has identified hiro nakamura , Who 's clearly and selfishly interfered with the timeline . [ whispering ] Just so I 'm clear ... On your personal scale of temporal justice , It 's okay , so long as no one gets hurt ? Yes . That is my definition . That 's good to know . Because I believe my next witness is here . Just tell me where she is . Claire bennet . You 've been holding out on me . What are you talking about ? Why I was supposed to find you , You and I are the same . I am nothing like you . You do exactly what I do . You use this ... Gift , This curse , whatever it is , to build walls . Make it impossible to actually connect with another person . Like gretchen . God , all those memory hits I got from your stuff While I was tying her up ... Have such a different context now . Everything in that room is so full of ... Pauses . What did you say ? Pauses . All these moments so ripe with subtext . " can I borrow your book ? " " cut my hand with these scissors . " All these interactions , And you still can 't say the one thing You really want to say to this girl . Heck ... You keep this up , you might end up alone forever too . You don 't know what you 're talking about . I think I do . The indestructible girl Who can 't put herself out there to get hurt . [ chuckles ] What ? No angry retort ? Ah ! [ painful moans ] You 're right , you are off your game . You just told me exactly where she is . [ pained screams ] How many people have I killed ? Hundreds , I suppose . And all of this because of an agreement You made with the defendant ? Yep . He told me if I saved the waitress I could have the cheerleader , And anybody else I wanted to kill . And as long as you saved his girlfriend You could kill some more . Willy-nilly . - Willy-nilly . Seems to me that a lot of people Were hurt as a result of mr . Nakamura 's time tampering . Really ? Does this look right to you ? Tell me again , who else met their death by your hand After hiro made this deal ? Well , there was her . And eden ... Ish . Two primatech guards . The melty guy , the mechanic , isaac mendez , my mother , Some guy named ted something--ted ... And so on , and so on . If hiro was acting out of an ability , Perhaps he should have stopped this vicious killer Before these countless murders- - - sprague ! Ted sprague . So saving charlie wasn 't for the heroic good . It was for the good of hiro . No . Romantic or not , charlie was a good person ! Fair enough . Then the prosecution would like to call its final witness . Charlie andrews . Oh , that 's right . I 've forgotten we can 't bring charlie in Because this worl d-improving person is lost in time . Now tell me , how did that happen again ? [ quietly ] I made a deal with a ... I 'm sorry . You 'll have to speak up . I made a deal with a villain , And he double-crossed me . Right . Prosecution rests , your honor . " a shake roof , wraparound porch , " and a stone path leading to a lake Where the sun glistens over the water . " How 'd you remember all of that ? I have my ways . I know all the details . By heart , it would seem . Hard to forget . I was holding you close to me , and the way you painted it , [ contented sigh ] It made it so real , like it came from your soul . Like ... Like it was you . You always know the right thing to say . You have the perfect scrap of poetry in your pocket to- - To what ? [ sighs ] [ giggling ] " with a big oak tree in the yard , Surrounded by wildflowers . " " and a couple of rocking chairs on the deck To watch the sun set . " You do remember . " with a fireplace to keep us warm . " " and a summer breeze to keep us cool . " How do you do it ? Hm ? Every ... Single ... Time . This is so beautiful . How did you do it ? My friends and I can do the most amazing things . Look . There 's your dream cottage . No more traveling now . We 'll make it a home . A real home . For me , for you . If you 'll have me . Oh ... Sam ! You said you couldn 't join a carnival . And now you don 't have to . There 's no more carriage homes , no more main homes , Just ... Just that . Away from everything . It 's what you talked about . It could be our life . I can 't live here . But you said- - I know , I know , I know , I know what I said . It 's just ... It 's just , I didn 't think you 'd actually- - - Actually do it ? - Yeah . But ... I mean ... This dress , and the milkshake , and ... All of this , this is a fantasy . And I made it come true . For you . No , sam . For you . This is your fantasy . And it 's- - it 's beautiful . And I 'm happy for you . But it isn 't me . My life isn 't here . But I changed everything for- - No , don 't tell me you did all this for me . Please , don 't- - Don 't tell me this was all for me . [ sighs ] No , of course not . Listen , um , I should get you back home . Thank you for indulging me . No , sam . No , it was really- - It was really nice to see you again . [ panting ] Gretchen ? Gretchen . Are you okay ? I 'm fine . All things considered . I 'm so sorry , this is all my fault . You never should 've gotten caught up in it . I 'm just- - I 'm happy you 're here . And that it 's over . It is over , isn 't it ? No . He 's not done- - [ glass shattering ] Somewhere out in the open ? No , he 'll be expecting that , he 's trying to flush us out . How do you know ? [ sighs ] 'cause apparently I get the way he thinks . - Someone 's coming ! - In here . i - So sylar , huh ? The sylar ? Yes . Well , no . Kind of the emo-apologist version . He 's had me trying to figure out what his issues are . Seriously ? How 'd that go ? Pencil in the eye . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Getting used to being all perils of pauline . No , not about that . Well , yes , about that . But ... About breakfast . About sometimes keeping you at arm 's length . It 's cool . Are you kidding ? If you don 't want to- - - I do want to . I just--I 'm scared . And I get afraid that I 'm gonna get hurt , And so I use my specialness to build these walls , Instead of , you know , jumping off bridges . I suck at metaphors , but what I 'm trying to say Is that- - - it 's okay , really . No . No , it 's not . This guy , sylar , he sat there and told me That we 're very much alike , and he 's not wrong . And I 'm afraid that I 'm gonna end up alone For the rest of my life like him . And I don 't know how to fix it . Do you want to talk about it ? I like to think of myself as Just a girl who happens to have powers . And it 's just one thing in a list of attributes- - Loyal , friendly , regenerative , good skin , you know ? - You do have good skin . - [ scoffs ] But when you put the chips down and life gets tough , I hide behind that one label , that one attribute . And I close myself off . Man , no wonder sylar 's so messed up . I can only imagine what having a bunch of excuses Could do to someone 's humanity . Maybe that 's his answer . In order to become human again , He has to get rid of all of his powers . Yeah , maybe . Now was that so hard ? You son of a bitch . Where is she ? It 's dinnertime . I imagine she 's right where you left her . You never took her ? Like I said , I 've been having a little trouble being myself . Gretchen ? [ gasps ] Oh ! You 're okay ! - Yeah ! - [ sighs ] Of course I 'm okay . Well , some guy stole my backpack , But what 's with you ? Nothing , I 'm fine . And then you 're here . And you 're all right . - Claire . You 're acting really weird . - I 'm sorry . I 'm really lucky to have you . And I 'm sorry about this morning . Forget it . You know me , impulsive gretchen wants to Hold hands so she does it . I know . And I love that about you . And I wanna be more like that , and not be beholden to Any label , or definition , or who I 'm supposed to be . I just- - I wanna hold your hand . People are gonna start to talk . Let them talk . Talking 's good . In fact , I could use some talking If you still have a sympathetic ear . I , in fact , have two ears . Come on . [ papers rustling ] Objection , your honor ! He 's reciting the opening to quantum leap . [ echoing ] we need to shock him . Give him 200 joules . Charging . Clear ! No response . - 240 . - Bring it up . Charging . Clear ! Still nothing . Start compression . We 're losing him . Still no pulse , we 're losing him . Let 's shock him again . Charging . Clear . Not so fast , carp . [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ panting ] We got a pulse . He 's coming back . He 's rising . [ soft ballad music ] ¶ ¶ Is something wrong , sir ? Yes , something is wrong . [ panting ] Am I scaring you ? [ laughs nervously ] Do I look scary ? Sir , I just wanted to know if- - You don 't think I can see how you 're looking at me right now ? That I 'm different ? Looking down your nose at me ? Like I 'm not good enough ! - [ whimpers ] I 'm done trying to change myself for you , Trying to fit into your world , Play by your rules . From now on , you 're gonna play by mine . [ rumbling ] [ yelling ] [ rumbling ] [ soft music ] ¶ ¶ Yeah . [ quiet whispers ] [ doorbell rings ] [ baby gurgles ] Just a minute ! [ humming softly ] Can I help you ? Hey . Hey , buddy . How are you ? I 'm sorry , I 'm gabriel . A friend of matt 's , 12th precinct . Oh , I 'm sorry , he 's not here right now . Oh , um ... Is there any way that you could tell me where he is ? It 's really important that I speak with him . Sure . I 'm sorry , have we met ?

( EERIE SQUEALING ) Jesus , man , wh ... Seth , are you okay ? I thought Rob was coming with you . Seth ! What the hell 's wrong ? Look , something happened to Rob . Something fucking took him and was chasing after me . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Calm down . Calm down . Calm down . What are you talking about ? ( COUGHS ) Rob was in my truck . We were driving here . And out of nowhere , this blue light explodes in front of me . I almost hit a fucking tree . And it was making this ear-piercing noise . Seth , there 's nothing outside . When did this happen ? Right now , on Perry Hill Road . Well , let 's go . Let 's go ? Yeah , I want you to show me where it happened . I 'm not fucking going back out there ! Did you hear what I said ? A beam sucked him into the fucking sky ! And you left him there . He wasn 't there . He fucking vanished . Seriously . Don 't go out there . Seth , you look like shit . You better not be fucking with me . I swear on my mother 's grave , Mark . Something took Rob . ( BUTTONS CLACKING ) Who are you calling ? I 'm calling Rob . ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ) ( DOG BARKING ) Mark ! It 's here . ( METALLIC SCREECHING ) Ah , fuck ! ( SQUEALING ) Did you hear that ? Mark ? What 's going on ? Jen , babe , go back to sleep .

( WHINING ) ( HIGH-PITCHED SQUEALING ) ( BOTH SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( THUNDERING BOOMS ) ( SQUEALING CONTINUES ) No ! No ! No ! ( NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE ) ( SCREECHING ) Here in Derry , we 've had numerous reports and now have confirmation the entire county went completely dark . Authorities have yet to find an explanation for the outage . Around the same time power was lost throughout the county , many residents reported seeing lights in the sky . It had nothing to do with the blackouts . It 's now been five days since Mark Fisher or Rob Baker have been seen . According to police , the two vanished sometime Friday night . During the county-wide blackouts . We have very little evidence as of now , and we currently only have two witnesses , both of whose accounts are very vague . Neither are suspects . Jen Craven , fiancée of Mark Fisher , was the last to see him alive on Friday , October the 13th . She now claims the pair 's best friend , Seth Hampton , may be responsible for the disappearance . We believe Mr. Hampton may have more to do with these disappearances than we previously thought . Earlier today , Seth Hampton was taken into police custody . No , I 've told you this . I don 't know where they are . I don 't know where either of them are . I don 't know what happened to them . I don 't know what the fuck is going on . I have these nightmares , and I ... I see Rob , and I see him screaming , and I see Mark ... What , do you think I cut the lights to be able to have an alibi ? Mark was my best friend ! Citing a lack of evidence , Seth Hampton has been released by local authorities . Hampton , claiming no memory of the evening 's events , maintains his innocence . ( GASPS ) ( ALARM CLOCK BEEPING ) God damn it . ( WATER RUNNING ) ( LINE RINGING ) Dr. Sean Lewis ' office . How may I help you ? Hi . This is Seth Hampton . I have an appointment on Friday , but I 'd like to change it . Okay , sir . - When would work best for you ? - Today . Sometime today , please . I 'm sorry , sir . We don 't have ... Look , it 's an emergency . Just tell the doctor who it is , and I only need 15 minutes . Hold on . ( MUSIC PLAYING ON TELEVISION ) Dan Fisk live here in Derry , which appears to be the epicenter of last night 's events . Over 50 local eyewitnesses claim that the lights appeared around midnight and stayed prominently in the sky ... Hello ? Sir ? Yes . Hello ? Can you come in at 11 : 00 ? I 'll be there . Thank you so much . Okay . I mean , I was nodding off . My girl , she wakes me up , and I 'm thinking maybe it 's , like , my neighbor with the lawn mower , and it 's this loud , annoying , buzzing sound . I go outside , and so this light lights up the sky ... ( LINE RINGING ) Hello . Roger 's hardware . - How can I help you ? - Nikki ? Nikki , it 's Seth . Uh , look , I have to go into the doctor 's this morning . Could you just let Clancy know I 'll be late ? Sure , let me just put you through to him . No , no . That 's okay . Just tell him I 'll be in by 1 : 00 . Thanks . 'Cause I remember ... I remember a few years ago , last time we had something like this happen , the whole town shut down , so I 'm ... I 'm a little concerned . These mysterious events have many people asking , does this have anything to do with the recent power outages that have plagued the county ? Many locals claim that these lights are eerily similar to ones that appeared in the night sky over Maine almost two years ago . Hey , hon . Yeah ? You still getting a ride home from Tracy ? As far as I know . You talked to the mechanic , right ? Yeah , He said it 'd be ready this afternoon . Just put it on my card . Are you sure ? Yep . Well , I 'm gonna head in . I 'll see you tonight . Something wrong ? No . I 'm fine . Can I have a kiss ? I 'll see you later . Hey , Jen . Sorry . I didn 't mean to interrupt you . Oh , that 's okay . I 'm just zoning out . So how you doing ? Did you have a good weekend ? Yeah . It was relaxing . Good . Good . Listen , Jen , I hate to do this to you . I 'm gonna have to drop your Thursday shift . This week ? Every week . I need those hours . I know you do , but it 's been a really slow winter , and I 've just been having too many people on . Look , I 'm really sorry . I 'm sure business is gonna pick up again soon , all right ? Fucker cut your hours too ? Yep , my Thursday shifts . That wicked sucks . Just be glad he didn 't cut two shifts , like he did Heidi . - Aw . - Yeah . I don 't know , I think it 's time to start looking for a new gig . Yeah , good luck . ( SNORTS ) Yeah . But anyway , I 'm fucking dying for a smoke break , so hurry up . I need you to cover me . Okay , I 'll be right out . Just give me a minute . 'Cause I remember ...

Many locals claim that these lights are eerily similar to ones that appeared in the night sky over Maine almost two years ago . These mysterious events have many people asking , does this have anything to do with the recent power outages ... I think I 'm going to take your sister out . You get a job ? I don 't need a job to take her out . You sure do . What , am I supposed to drive you guys ? She 's got a car . - She 's got a car . - She can pick me up . Yeah , she doesn 't have a job either . ( CHUCKLES ) How many of those things you had ? - Don 't know . You got any more ? - No . Why you throwing it in the woods now ? Wait . Wait . What ? See that ? Is that a body ? Yeah , it 's got to be . Go check it out . I 'm not fucking around with no dead bodies . Don 't be a pussy . Come on . What are you doing with that ?

Please . That 'd be great . Okay , just give me one moment . Seth ? Seth . Holy shit . Jen ... I really need to talk to you . Seth , I 'm at work . It 's important . I have no one else to talk to . Please . Okay , but it has to be quick . ( PULSING AMBIENT MUSIC ) ( SHRIEKING ) ( SPLATTERING ) It 's been a long time . Almost two years . How have you been ? Better . Are you still with Nicole ? I just ... I want you to know something . I said a lot of things , and I did a lot of things to you that I regret . And I 'm sorry . I know that you would never do anything to hurt Mark or Rob . You told everyone it was me . I don 't remember everything about that night either , but what I do ... it 's unexplainable . You still don 't remember anything at all , do you ? The flashes . That noise . The lights . You 're still going on about this . I don 't blame you , Seth . You can just give up this bullshit story and move on . I notice you 've moved on . It 's been two years , Seth . Did you just expect me to wait around every day for Mark to come back ? ( SCOFFS ) Why are you really here , Seth ? Did you see the news this morning ? It 's the lights , isn 't it ? The same ones everyone saw that night . What about them ? There 's something weird going on . I think it has to do with Mark . I really don 't think I can take this , Seth . Look , Jen , I 've never told you this ... never told really anybody ... but something happened to me that night . What do you mean ? The days leading up to the night him and Rob disappeared , I was having nightmares , awful ones . They felt so real . I couldn 't quite remember them exactly , but I remember flashes , the beams of light . And you never told anyone ? No . Everyone already thought I was crazy enough . But guess what I 've been dreaming about . Seth , Mark is dead . You have to understand that and move on . It seemed pretty easy for you , didn 't it ? I 'm sorry , Jen . Look . I ... I 'm dead serious about this . - I know I sound fucking crazy . - Yes , you do . Would you listen to me , please , Jen ? Mark is coming back ! I can feel it . I 've seen it . You saw it in a dream , Seth . You went through a traumatic experience , which you 're clearly not over . That 's what happens . No , this is something else . ( SIGHS ) I have to get back to work . Can I have your number ? You know , just in case . In case what ? Anything happens I have tried to call you a couple of times . I don 't exactly live in the same place anymore . Did you move in with your new guy ? Get some sleep , Seth . Maybe see a doctor . Was that who I think it was ? You scared the shit out of me ! Sorry . It was Seth , wasn 't it ? What the hell was he doing here ? You shouldn 't be talking to him . It 's no good for you . Look , Tracy , something fucking weird going on . Well , what did he want ? He said something bad was gonna happen . And he started talking about Mark . ( SIGHS ) It just threw me off a little bit . Do you want to take a few minutes ? - Yeah , I need some fresh air . - All right . I 'll be right back . ( PULSING AMBIENT MUSIC ) ( BELL JINGLES ) Where are we ?

I need you to give Jimmy a hand stocking up aisle three . We 'll see how the day goes . Get to work . ( ENGINE IDLING ) Missed you last night . What ? My girlfriend 's party . I thought you were coming out . ( SIGHING ) Yeah . Didn 't feel like it . There was a ton of her hot girlfriends there . I 'm sure there was . You need to start coming out more , man . You need a girl . I 'm fine . Just gonna sit inside the rest of your life , rotting away ? Just because I didn 't want to go to your girlfriend 's fucking birthday party , I 'm rotting away ? I 'm just trying to help you , get you out of the house . You need it . What the fuck is that supposed to mean ? Never mind . Jesus . ( SIGHS ) I 'm sorry . I don 't mean to be an asshole . I 'm sure that Annie has some awesome friends . Have you been out at all since it happened ? Just because I don 't want to go out drink ... Seth , your nose . Oh , shit . Is there something you 're not telling me ? There 's nothing to tell , Clancy . You getting sick again ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Don 't play stupid . Look , I 'm fine , all right ? A healthy man does not get three nosebleeds inside of a week . On top of that , you 've been late almost every morning . You look like shit .

They aren 't sure . They found a body at a gas station . They think there 's another one , but they can 't find it . How was he killed ? Head was blown right the fuck off . Pretty cool , huh ? Seth ? ( TOOL CLATTERS ) Seth , you okay ? Yeah , I just need to sit down for a second . All right . Let 's go in the back , okay ? Let 's sit you down for a few minutes , okay , buddy ? You better tell me what the fuck is going on , Seth . I don 't know . You went to the doctor today . What the hell did they say ? Nothing . They said nothing ?

Again , police are treating this as a homicide and are asking any local residents that if they must venture out , please take precaution . You okay , hon ? Police says there may be a second homicide ... What 's going on ? And officials are asking anyone with any information ... Something 's not right . I just feel ... strange . What do you mean ? You know when Seth came in here earlier ? He said something like this was gonna happen . What ? You think Seth had something to do with that ? It 's just ... Seeing Seth and the lights ... And now the murders ... I just ... I don 't feel so good . Late word from the state police says there may be a second homicide victim , and officials are asking ...

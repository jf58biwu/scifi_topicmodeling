 Previously , on Warehouse 13 ... I spent some time in a psyche research facility . And I just told you I was in an institution . This is Abigail Chow . Ms. Chow is the new owner of the Bed-And-Breakfast . What exactly did you do before you bought the BB ? A lot of things . Why do you ask ? Anything in the field of psychotherapy ? - Yes . - I killed someone I love . Let 's talk . [ Door clangs ] [ Gasping ] [ Indistinct chatter ] Briggs ! Where is Briggs ? I shot him !

[ Panting ] I don 't care . I shot that guy . I killed him . If you say so . Maybe your friend Shultz 'll have a change of heart next . So my client just ran into the station , waived counsel , and confessed . Yeah , that 's kind of hard to believe . You got a dozen witnesses . [ Chuckles ] Yeah , all cops , and you 're the DA . Well , they don 't do everything that I tell them . Why would he confess ? Your own lab said that there was no evidence . Actually , that 's not quite correct . My report said that there was insufficient evidence to satisfy a judge . And thank you for saying that in front of the defense , Ms ... Emily Lake . And to be clear , I did also say that he 's guilty . Open wide . I know it 's difficult being the accused . You always friendly to confessed killers ? No reason not to be civil . We 're all here to find the truth . I thought we were here to put bad guys away , but whatever . Yes , let 's just go with " whatever , " shall we ? Hands , please . Thank you .

She 's here to help Artie . Make your own breakfast . You 're an adult . Sort of . That 's gross . Well , this is awesome . Now we have somebody who 's gonna be analyzing everything we do , judging our every move . I thought that was Artie 's job . Hey , Steve , you know how to make scones , right ? I don 't even like scones . I miss old stereotypes . [ Chuckles ] - Ooh ! - Another stereotype shattered . - [ Snickers ] - [ Clicks tongue ] That 's it ? Cereal ?

No , later , later . Meet me at the FISH ASAP . - I 'll just get dressed . - Oh , this isn 't , um , like , therapist business . He means agents only , so ... Who says I do ? Bring Abigail too . But she 's not dressed , and you said ASAP . I 'll just be two minutes . [ Cell phone ringing ] [ Beep ] Hello ? Helena ? So you 're a lab tech . Forensic scientist . Quite a natural fit for me , really , with my aptitude for science and powers of observation . Any details I needed to play it convincingly I was able to glean from the television . I 'm really hoping it wasn 't from Dexter , 'cause that 's ... That 's evidence , and it 's covered in bodily fluids . [ Glass shatters ] I understand how you 're doing this . What I don 't get is why . What happened ? We ... we haven 't heard from you in months . I was under strict orders not to contact anyone while I had the astrolabe . After returning it to the brotherhood , I wanted a new life , one far away from the world of artifacts . Now , may I fill you in on the case at hand ? Of course . The suspect 's name is Richard Purcell . He and a partner allegedly killed a mini-mart owner during a robbery . Both were released on technicalities . Then Purcell willingly returned and confessed . And when I observed him during booking , it was as if he was ... transforming . Transforming ? Transforming how ? Like dangerous , Jekyll and Hyde , werewolf , Roseanne Barr ?

[ Rattling and rumbling ] - Artie ... - Yeah ? Are we sure Abigail should be in here when this is going on ? For her own safety , her being new and all . All hands on deck .

I mean , the cops couldn 't make the case . I 'm asking myself the same question . Well , what about your , uh , your partner , Donald Shultz ? They think he was with you . He swears he 's innocent . Donny is innocent . He wasn 't around that night . - He can prove it . - Why doesn 't he ? He ... can 't ... say where he was . Right . So we 've got a guilty guy who blabbed after he got off and an innocent guy who could get off but won 't . It 's an irony artifact . Uh , Mr. Purcell , think back . What were you doing just before you came to the station ? [ Screaming ] No ! No . [ Gasping ] No . - Hey , hey ... - Everybody leave me alone ! [ Thrashing ] Leave me alone ! [ Sobbing ] Whatever that artifact is scared him so much that he can 't even think about it . We need to find Shultz . Please ! Please ! I swear , ask Purcell . I wasn 't there . [ Loud , distorted noises ] [ Screaming ] [ Skin crackling ] Why is the Secret Service interviewing my prisoner ? Why ... why are you even interested in this case ? We have our reasons . Purcell is ... is too freaked out even to admit why he made the confession . Donald Shultz was just found dead . So who would want to hurt these guys ? Lots of people . Have you seen their known associates ? Besides , Shultz wasn 't murdered . The coroner said he died of a heart attack . Right , a totally healthy kid with no history of heart trouble . I 'm not a doctor , and neither are you . Maybe it was hereditary . Look , we did some digging . Shultz was arrested the same night of the robbery in Illinois for being in a bar fight . So he couldn 't have done it . Shultz had a sheet as long as your arm . And whether he committed this crime or not , Purcell did . Look , this is an election year . The last thing I need is the two of you poking holes in a solid public confession where an innocent citizen was murdered . You talk to my prisoner or my officers again , I will have you arrested for interfering with a criminal investigation . Now go protect the president or something . - Is it possible that ... - Oh , look . I have to make a phone call . Whatever this thing is , Artie , it generates major fear . Yeah , are there any artifacts that can literally scare someone to death ? Yeah , only ... only hundreds of them . I mean , it could be anything from the Inquisition . It could be the first failed attempt at skydiving . The showerhead from Psycho . Oh , great , another Hitchcock artifact . The guy should have his own section . Yeah , w ... [ Rumbling ] Artie , any luck with those tremors ? Yeah , we 're working on it . Working on it . Uh , yeah , tell me more about the physical changes that HG saw . That could help narrow it down . Well , she saw Purcell 's face change a bit and his fingernails recede . But , uh , she didn 't see that much . But before that , what did the guy actually look like when he first went into the station ? Well , HG got there later , but I bet they have closed-circuit cameras . Yeah , but the DA hates us . And no , Artie , it 's not because of anything I did . [ Loud rumbling ] All right , now , list ... listen . I-I-I gotta go . Keep me posted . Find a way to get that video . Hey , Mykes , you know the owner of the mini-mart that Purcell killed ? He had a family , right ? Yeah . Well , if we had a nickel for every time someone used an artifact for revenge , we 'd have , like , a billion nickels . And in dollars , that would be , like ... [ Grunts ] Well , in nickels , it w ... I got it . So ... great . You go interview the family , and I think I know how to get that video . - This goes like this , right ? - Uh ... Uh , care ... careful with that . Sorry . This building is old and falling apart . Yes , we have that in common . Ha ha ! Beat you to it . Yes , well , how much shaking can it take ? Good point . The four of us could take weeks to find the source . Well , you know , the geological survey has sensors in the ground at every major fault . And depending on the intensity of the sensor , they can determine the epicenter . And ... Why would you have those at the Warehouse ? This is not the San Andreas . - Forget I ever said anything . - Uh ... [ Loud rumbling ] Oh ! - Claudia ! - I don 't know why ! Wh ... why what ? Why ... why nothing . What do you want ? The artifact removal detection system ... Oh , yes , repurpose sensors that are already in place . Of course . Then I could boost power to the system , make sure it feels every vibration . I will overlay the data onto a grid of the Warehouse and cross-ref . Yeah , that . Nice suggestion , Doctor . Don 't get a big head . [ Rumbling ] I almost got it . [ Beeping ] I got it , I got it .

[ Creaking and groaning ] [ Electricity crackling ] - Found it . - My . - There ! - There 's the problem . - What are those ? - Expansion joints for when the Warehouse automatically expands to make room for artifacts . For some reason , they 're jammed . I think that 's what 's causing the tremors . Great , well , that explains everything , except for the part where you said the Warehouse automatically expands .

You and Emily solved cases together , and you went on amazing adventures . - How did you ... - Well , the old friends part is obvious from your body language . The surprise I could just see on Emily 's face . So you must be here from out of town . And knew you were something like police 'cause , well , you 're wearing a badge . Emily taught her that . - Ah . [ Chuckles ] - One correction . There were no amazing adventures . Myka and I were just roommates at Iowa Tech . Right . Crazy days on the quad .

So how long have you lived here ? About six months . I met Nate at a cooking class . [ Laughing ] No , don 't laugh . Um , and then ... and then Adelaide . Myka , they invited me into their home , their lives . For the first time in over a century , I feel like ... I feel like I belong . So does Nate know who you really are ? I can 't very well tell him I 'm HG Wells , the 147-year-old father of science fiction . They 'd put me away . So will you help us ? The cops won 't , and we need that video . I can 't . Myka , I can 't . Helena , people are getting hurt . One 's already dead . And by the way , you called us . So ... Don 't you think you owe it to Adelaide to have one more amazing adventure ?

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Come on , old friend . So what ? You think our Jimmy took a play date ? If there 's a history log in here , we could look up ... There . Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually ... A woman . Could you please be careful with that ? I know all about it . You what ? I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . Cavorite was an antigravity metal that Wells wrote about but Cavorite doesn 't exist . James ! James ! I 'm sorry , Arthur . Will you stop trying to confuse me ! Pete , you 've been affected by an artifact . Myka , you and Artie got to get out of here . He 's got snipers all over the place . The telegraph seems to have tapped into some subliminal anxiety . Take some time off , Agent Lattimer . Hmm . I guess I 'm just lucky that the only vet in Univille makes house-calls . I love ferrets . Besides , this is a farming community and if I didn 't make house calls , my office would look like a traveling circus . Myka ! Guess how many croissants I shoved into my mouth at once ? One day you 'll have to tell me how you got partnered up with that one . Well , the croissant thing is actually kind of impressive when you see it . Yeah , at least it keeps him from talking . Oh , that 's right , you prefer your males to bark and hump your leg . I 'm sure it 's in your repertoire . Okay . Okay . Thank you . We have to get back to work , but thank you so much for coming . Myka , for you , any time . Okay . What is with you two ? She started it . Good , good , you 're here . Follow me . We got a ping . Awesome . Time to get back out there and kick some artifact butt . Mmm , not you . No , until we 're sure that there 's no residual effect from your last encounter , you are grounded . Myka , you 're going to Tamalpais University in Northern California . Artie , this is about a wrestling team . No , no , no , no , no ... Low IQ ... All right , all right , all right . Yes , yes , it 's about a wrestling team . This wrestling team , they 've lost every match for the last seven years and overnight they 've become unstoppable . Uh-uh . This is one of ours . I know you wrestled in college . What can I say ? Irony is my specialty . Grounded ! This team was tested for steroids , right ? One of the kids on the team died . Three weeks ago , in a fire , alone , camping . If an artifact is helping them , it could also be killing them . Okay . I 'm on it . Yeah , Claudia , take this , because you 're going with Myka to California as a backup . For reals ? My first official assignment as an agent ? Shut up ! As an apprentice . While you 're on campus , enroll and get a degree , will you ? Oh , you never stop with that ! Should I have worn something more business suity ? You know , so people take me seriously as an agent ? You 're not an agent . You 're an apprentice . Right . Apprentice . Taking notes . Jeans are fine . Well , it looks like they won again . You think the artifact 's in here ? Anything 's possible , but artifacts don 't talk . People talk . Right . Interviews with people . Indeed . I 'm ready to begin my apprentice education . Always happy to answer questions on how much we 're winning , but I 'm not sure what exactly you 're investigating . Whoa , should an apprentice really be in here ? We just have some routine questions . Yeah . Garry ! Garry ! Come talk to these ladies . Sure , Coach ! What 's up ? Hi , Garry , is it ? So why do you think your team started winning ? What changed ? Coach Tappon finally got our asses in gear ! He got us to want it , again . If you want it bad enough , you 're going to crush it . And now , we 're crushing it ! But seven straight seasons without a win and now all of a sudden ... Claudia , do you want to see what 's going on out in the hallway ? Okay . Thanks . Bye . Hey , aren 't you the guy who just won ? I feel weird . My muscles are hurting bad . I think I need ... Myka ! Myka ! One death on a team is bad enough . Two is unthinkable . But I know Philip would want us to go on . How 'd it go with the police ? He just caught on fire , Myka . I should have done something . There wasn 't anything to do . You would have done something . You would have stayed calm , at least . I literally freaked out . So the police are calling it an accident ? Of undetermined cause . But I hacked the coroner 's report on both deaths . Check it out . Teddy Benson , the wrestler who died in the campsite fire , burn patterns show that the fire started inside his sleeping bag . Okay , so two deaths by spontaneous combustion on the same wrestling team . Yeah . I call shenanigans . Mmm-hmm . And unless a sweaty gym sock is the artifact then there 's nothing that ... Okay , there 's that . Oh , yeah . I 'm going to score that a 9.8 . All right , I am going to go talk to the coach about that medal and you follow up with the team . Follow up ? By myself ? Yeah . Talk to them . You know , investigate . Sure . Yeah , I 'll just follow up . Ah , mommy ! Pete ! Are those Timothy Leary 's glasses ? Take them off right now . It 's not a toy . I 'm bored , okay ? They make things so much less boring . Did you hear what I said ? Take them off right now . Right now . Wouldn 't you rather have a nice little fish ? Okay , stop it . Give me the glasses . Don 't . Get up . You 're in my chair . Child . Man , desk duty is lame . Ow . Oh , it 's nothing personal , senor Sensitive-o . No . Ow . What ? What ? What ? What is it ? It 's nothing . It 's no big deal . It 's just probably my appendix growing back . Your who with the what now ? Yeah , it 's a ... It grows back every year . It 's a side effect of spending too much time in the Warehouse . Huh ! Nothing to worry about it . It 's all good . Yeah , I need a visit from the doctor . Yeah . What ? Are you serious ? Touching a gold medal caused them to burn up ? You got both paddles in the water ? You were a champion , now you 're a coach . I know what it 's like to do good work and no one notices . A winning team puts you back on top . You think I 'm involved in their deaths ? You 're out of our mind . If I 'm crazy , show me the medal . I 'm not showing you anything . Coach Tappon , we 'd love for you to join us whenever you 're free . Great , Jeff , I 'm sorry . Just give me a sec . Be right with you . Great . Now I 'm pissing off the team 's benefactors so you can accuse me of attacking my guys . I am just trying to protect more ... If you scare my guys , I 'll have you thrown off this campus . So Garry , is it ? Yeah . Um ... Can I help you ? So , Coach Tappon , does he ever seem maybe too intent on winning ? Too intent on winning ? I don 't even know what that means . I mean , does he put you under a lot of , you know , pressure ? Pressure ? Have you ever tried getting out of a half nelson while a 200 pound monster is on top of you ? Okay , now when you say monster , I 'm going to assume you mean a really big guy , not an actual monster because in my line of work ... What I mean is pressure is good . It makes you win . Okay . Yes . But does the coach care about your safety or just winning ? Would he risk a wrestler 's life to , I don 't know , place in a match or ... Hey , this is my coach we 're talking about . I 'm not going to let you rip on him . Oh , no , no , no , I wouldn 't deign to rip . I 'm just observing , analyzing the facts , supposing a possible ... Interrogating the ... Not that you would ... You okay ? You seem kind of new at this . Are you like that other lady 's assistant or something ? Or something . If I need anything I 'll circle back . Thanks so much for coming , Doctor . Mmm . Mmm . How 's that ? Does that hurt ? It 's fine . Well ... How about there ? No . So , our own Warehouse doctor , huh ? Yes , Pete , it 's in the manual , chapter 112 , section F , paragraph three . Yeah . I haven 't quite gotten to chapter 112 yet . Yeah , why don 't you go downstairs and read it right now ? Well , I was hoping you 'd read it to me , papa . Vanessa , I 'm really sorry about him . I 'm sorry you have to come all the way to South Dakota just for this . Oh , well , your appendix is always the highlight of my year , Artie . Wow , what 's the rest of your year like ? Have you been working on your meridians ? My ... The acupuncture points I ask you to tap on like this . It tickles . I can 't do that . I know . Sit up . Okay . Yes , I have actually , I 've worked on some of the ... Oh , you 're lying to me . Yes , I am . If you 're going to blow hot air , would you mind blowing into this for me , please ? Yeah , well , you 're not infected . Well , that 's good , right ? Yeah , it 's good . Given your proclivity to appendicitis , I really still think we should remove it again . Okay . Just prophylactically . " Prophylactically . " Shut up . I place myself in your hands . Okay . Let me go put on some scrubs and prepare the procedure room . And I 'll let you know when I 'm ready for you , okay ? Okay . Awesome . Maybe I 'm wrong but are Vanessa and Artie sitting in a tree ? Oh , don 't be absurd . We 're two adults who just have a lot of professional respect for each other and shut up . K-l-S-S-l-N-G . I knew it ! News flash , Artie is human . Walk away . You like her . Stop it . You want to hug her and kiss her . All right , I 'm walking away . All right ! Don 't touch me there . Good , you 've got the purple goo . Coach Tappon 's office is empty . Artie said there 's no record of Tappon 's medal on file but we should still goo it just in case . It was hard to hear . Pete kept singing something about Artie in a baby carriage . Good . Let 's go get this medal . You think he 's doing this on purpose ? No , but I think he 's hiding something . How can you tell , like , just from one interview ? I mean , is that instinct ? Instinct is just a fancy way of saying , " I 've done this 10,000 times . " You don 't think maybe this guy 's different ? Human beings are predictable . People rarely surprise you . Turn around and put your hands in the air . Slowly . H.G. Wells . Agent Bering . It seems we 're further destined to meet at gunpoint . Ladies , I know this is a bit awkward , but maybe we can ... Or we could just do this . You are going back to the Bronze Sector . What ? What did I do ? You 're a killer . And a thief . Brain requires oxygen to speak . Myka . I 'm not a killer . Oh , has the definition of killer changed a bunch since the 1890s ? Because , H.G. , you killed a guy . James MacPherson ? He would have quite happily killed all of you . Why are you here ? Did you just happen to show up ? I 'm hunting for the same artifact as you . That 's what we 're looking for . That 's rather my point . Take it . If you didn 't believe me just a little , you 'd have shot me by now . The coach ! He can 't find us in here . He can 't find you in here . He hasn 't met me yet . What ? No . No . No ! Is your name Coach Tappon ? Yeah . Oh , thank God I 've found you . She 's good . Yeah , sure . In an obvious kind of way . Worked on Pete in London . Well , that 's not exactly scaling Mount Everest , is it ? Come on , let 's call Artie . An appendectomy ? Are you ... Yeah , forget it . I 'm fine . Just tell me exactly what 's going on . Room 's all set . Are you ? Uh , as ever . Just a sec because I 'm on the ... Okay . Look ... You know what ? I got it . Just take care of yourself . Okay . Thanks . My turn . Oh . Don 't start without me . What ? Nothing . I was just wondering what this was doing on your shelf ? I 'm wondering what you 're doing messing around with my things . That 's the Barnum Top . Ba-bam ! Oh , that 's right , sir . I 've been doing a little read-a-roonie of the Artifact Manifests . Fascinating stuff . Turns out P.T. Barnum used this to , and I quote , " Increase the shock factor in his side shows " by using it to grow human limbs " and in some cases internal organs . " You , sir , have been growing back your appendix in an attempt to get Vanessa to visit the Warehouse . That 's so romantic . Are you quite finished ? If only ... So , no , then . ... there were some way for you to interact with Vanessa that did not involve invasive surgery . Perhaps some kind of , I don 't know , social ritual , one involving the sharing of food or the enjoying of filmed entertainment with , maybe , some duds that have been milked . I mean a date . I know what you mean . Artie , you like her . She , hey , hey , hey , likes you . Ask the woman out . Artie . I 'm sorry . I 'm going to have to postpone the surgery . A Regent has tungsten poisoning of all things . And I have to leave for Budapest immediately . Ooh , that sounds serious , there . You should go . All right . I got to make my flight arrangements . Get out of my sight . Don 't come near me or I 'll kill you . Really ? Nothing . Nope . The medal is not the artifact . Which also means that H.G. Had nothing to lose by handing it over . Unless she didn 't know either . Oh , she knew . I don 't know what her game is but I don 't trust her . Well , I swiped Tappon 's records from the personnel office . Last month , he moved to Bayside Heights . Very shmancy and Richie Rich . Where does a college wrestling coach get the money to buy a house like that ? Maybe H.G. ' s paying him off . Where would she get the money ? Well , you accrue a lot of interest in 100 years . I 'm going to go snoop around for a connection . You finish interviewing the wrestling team . Um , no . Maybe I should stick to the computer stuff . I 'm really not good at the interviews , especially with , you know , people . Mmm-hmm . Okay . So why do you say that ? Well , I tried to be like you , you know , all professional and adult . And that ... Is really , really dumb . Is that your version of a pep talk ? No . We already have one me . We don 't need another me , okay ? I want you to go in there and be more like you . What would that get us ? Claudia , you 're the same age as these guys . You 're a peer . You can connect with them . Yeah , not so much . Okay . Okay , go back to the Warehouse , then . Not everyone 's cut out for field work . You know , stay behind a computer forever . Forever is kind of a long time . I don 't have time to hold your hand through this , Claud . If you are not up for this ... I didn 't say that . Okay , well , let me know how it goes . I will . Good , then . Good . I know what you did there . I know . It 's because you 're smart . Go . Gare-bear . Afternoon . Let 's talk . Hey , irritating question girl , we kind of already talked . No , you already avoided telling me anything . Now we talk . By the way , Photoshop . Anyway , check this . Philip and Teddy 's deaths were not accidental . My intel says coach is dirty . Maybe even got some payola . Thoughts ? Stratego ! What do you know ? Nothing . It 's just a feeling . Spill it , Hulk-ling . Don 't make me angry . Coach Tappon saved us , okay ? I mean , in a town like this , you either work at the bottling plant or you get out . And now even the plant 's about to close down . Because of Coach , now I have options and maybe a scholarship . I have people who did that for me too , gave me options . Well , then you know I can 't turn on him . Yeah , but , dude , if something bad is happening to your friends , even by accident , don 't you owe them , too ? He started acting weird after Teddy died , closed door meetings , phone calls in the middle of practice . He was acting ... Guilty ? No . Scared . No , it 's too dangerous . Listen to me , they think I 'm responsible . What if I am ? No . No . I 'm sorry , but I 'm ending this now . Okay , here 's what you 're going to do . Set something up for when she gets back . Dinner , a movie ... I can 't do that now . Take her for a walk , show her the Dark Vault , it doesn 't matter , okay ? Just make a plan . I don 't know . Okay . Be one of those agents that 's obsessed with the Warehouse . That always works out so well . All right . Well , you know you 're not infected so you should be all right until I get back , Artie . You okay with this ? Um ... Have a nice flight . Thanks . Jeez , Artie , it 's not like she hasn 't already seen you naked . Thank you very much for that . This was no accident . It means someone else out there knows about the artifact . Look who 's here . Keep an eye on things , Claud . Hey ! Our lead suspect was killed and look who shows up . Oh , do stop it . What motive could I possibly have for killing those boys and their wrestling coach ? That 's an excellent question . Perhaps we should ask the Regents . They did have you bronzed once . You know as well as I , women are held to a different standard . Something , by the way , I thought would have changed by now . Don 't you dare play that card with me . Why not ? Your partner died and people whispered . If you 'd been a man ... Nice . That 's very clever . You did your research . What did you steal from the Escher Vault ? That 's what I thought . I took back what was mine . Oh , and what is that ? That more Cavorite ? What are you going to do , yank me up into the sky ? The only power it has is over me . It 's my daughter . It was my Christina . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now , except the Warehouse . Look , I know what it 's like to lose someone . I want to come back and work there again . You what ? That 's why I 'm doing all of this . To prove I am still a good agent . Look , I 'm sorry about your little girl . I really am . But it 's not possible ... Please . You can 't ... Please . Every day in this world is a reminder of what I 've lost . My child , my friends , my life . I have no tether here . The Warehouse is the only home I have now . Oh ! Wow . I do miss the horse and buggy days . Progress is , in many ways , overrated . Oh ! Oh ! A grappling hook ? I designed it myself . What ? Nothing . It 's just a little old-fashioned . Well , it wasn 't when I invented it . It seems to have saved your life . And yet you 're still wondering if I set this whole thing up just to prove my innocence . Oh , the thought did cross my mind somewhere between , " Holy crap , I 'm going to die , " and " Oh , I 'm flying . " And what have you concluded ? The jury 's still out . I suppose if we work together , it may be faster . And you could keep an eye on me . Yes . That thought crossed my mind , too . You coming ? Hey , look what I found . Tag says it reduces shyness , so I ... Artie ? Pain . Lots . Not good . Never hurt like this before . That 's because the doc always took it out . Yeah . Must still be growing . Might keep growing until it bursts . This is called breaking and entering these days . It always was . Things haven 't changed much . Why don 't you take the desk ? I 'll go through the closet . Aye-aye . So you built that gun , huh ? You are coveting my grappler . Old-fashioned , indeed . Admiring , maybe . Not coveting . My tech level skill could come in very handy when I come back to work . Why were you bronzed ? The scales that Lady Justice holds are more easily tipped than one knows . The world is never as you think it should be . Well , it 's not my decision anyway . You know , I don 't even think it 's Artie 's . Of course . No pressure . Just making conversation . Pointed conversation , but nevertheless . Here , let me . Oh . H.G. , come here . Look at these pictures . These are all of Philip , only he 's ... Quite a bit more of a roly-poley . Look at the dates on these files . He did this in three weeks . Something 's turning these boys into perfect specimens . And then killing them . Here we go . To this chair . Help ! Little help here . At some point you people will have to realize that veterinarian means animal doctor . Not humans . I don 't want to be here either , so ... Oh ! Look , Doc Owens is out of town . His appendix is about to burst so it 's either the vet or the barber . An appendectomy . You do realize that most of the surgeries I perform are spaying and neutering ? Okay . The barber . The barber . Look , Artie , please sit down . Okay . I mean , come on . Help the guy out . Hey , I can make him look like a giant walrus if that makes it any easier . Artie , I will help you , if only to take you out of his care . Good idea . Come on . Let 's go to the exam room . Oh ! Hey , croissant boy , I need a prep nurse . Get in here . Okay . But I 'm not shaving anything . More wrestlers are getting sick . Pretty soon the whole team 's going to end up extra crispy . That 's strange . Why would they put a padlock on a fridge ? " Boiling Point energy drink . " Myka , every time I saw Garry , he was chugging one of these drinks . It 's the drink . Claudia , you have to get to Garry and warn him . On it . The artifact is in the drink . So , Dr. Mahoney , you created the Boiling Point formula ? Yes . And there 's nothing harmful in it . It 's vitamins , caffeine , amino acids . It 's like any other drink on the market except that ours is specially formulated to accelerate muscle growth . It helps people . You 're testing it on the wrestling team at Tamalpais . There are laws against that . Nonsense . It was a focus group . The kids were getting faster , stronger ... And combustible . Boiling Point financially supports the team and you paid Coach Tappon , to get them to drink it . It wasn 't my idea . It was mine . Jeff Russell . Welcome , ladies . Gerald , they 're looking for you in the lab . Great . On campus you pulled Coach Tappon into a meeting . Boiling Point is your company . Founder and CEO , Miss ... Agent Bering . Secret Service . And you are ? Agent Wells , who is also an agent under me . Does whatever I say . Lots of companies support school teams and we owe a lot to this town . For me , it was personal . You were on the wrestling team ? Coach Tappon helped me focus my life . I wanted to give something back . So what ? So people died . Coach Tappon died . And I 'm sad about that . But I 'm still waiting to hear your proof that my drink was responsible . Or you could come with me and I can prove to you that it 's completely harmless . Might be a trap . Usually is . Here 's my impression of Pete at the sight of blood . No , no , no , no , no . Yes . I never sounded like ... Okay , that 's fairly accurate . It 's because I was worried about him . Oh , right , right . It 's sweet . A little girly , but sweet . Girly . Artie , we thought you would recuperate better here . But you got to promise that you 're going to try to get some rest . Great . Artie loves resting . Oh , and he will , because I 'm putting you in charge . If he 's not up on his feet in a couple of days , I 'm coming after you . You 're in charge . That 's right , old boy . I 'll go get you some soup . Okay . You should ask her out . Me ? Ask her out ? Yeah . Right . Or be one of those agents obsessed with the Warehouse . That always works out so well . You weren 't talking to me . Oh , no ? No . Oh , who was I talking to ? Let 's just see . When I died in the tunnel , didn 't you think for just an instant , " Poor Artie , he gave his life to this place and he died alone ? " And since then , I see what 's been happening to you . What happening ? No happening . Yeah . I think you 're worried that you caught a glimpse into your own future . Oh , those painkillers are making you loopy , old boy . I 'm not on any painkillers . And then , your stuff didn 't come from home so you feel uprooted . And last week , you imagined reconnecting to an old girlfriend . In my defense , I do have a lot of those dreams . Yeah . You don 't have to miss out on having a real life , like I did . I 'd be honored to have a life like yours . And I 'd be honored if you tried for a little more . Dude , you look like Bantha poodoo . Well , as you can see I feel fantastic . Spread the word to your teammates , stop drinking those dumb energy drinks . And I need your help . Why ? What 's wrong with ... No , just trust me . The bottling plant , you said it was closing down . Why ? I don 't know . It 's some kind of deal to sell it off or something . Talk to me more about that . I found some tea . Why don 't you people have soup ? I mean , everybody has soup . We 're weird . Surgery was fun , huh ? You got some moves with that knife . Want to get dinner ? Or coffee ? Pastries ? The hardware store has a candy aisle . We 're not going out . We can stay inside . I heard the hardware store delivers candy . Look , my ex , it turns out he 's a giant tool box and I moved to a place where I couldn 't possibly meet any cute men so ... Uh-huh . You think I 'm cute . Pete , we 're not going out . Yeah , but you think I 'm cute . As you can see there 's nothing dangerous in the drink . Well , do you collect test samples from every batch ? For safety purposes . It 's standard practice . Why ? That ladle . Is that what your people use to collect the samples ? I suppose . Myka , do you know Godfrid 's Spoon ? No . We looked for it at Warehouse 12 . Godfrid Haraldsson , a Viking prince . Supposedly forged from the armor of fallen warriors . His men would drink from it before a battle . It gave them strength . What are you talking about ? Mr. Russell , where did you get this ladle ? I don 't know . It 's always been here . Myka ! Yeah . This plant 's closing . Production moves to Naperville , Illinois , in three weeks . What 's in Naperville , Illinois ? OmniCo headquarters . They 're buying Boiling Point . Beaucoup bucks for the founder . That gives you motive to keep the deaths quiet until the deal goes through and it 's not your problem anymore . This belongs to me . Gerald , what are you doing ? You have no right to come in here . That ladle touches every batch of Boiling Point . Uh-oh . You don 't have to answer their questions , Jeff . Mr. Russell , does Dr. Mahoney have stake in your company 's sale to OmniCo ? Gerald 's been with Boiling Point since the beginning . Jeff . He must have a fortune in stock options by now . Jeff , shut up . Gerald , for God 's sakes , give them the ladle . No ! No ! No ! Hey ! Hey ! Claudia ! Grab Mahoney . Gerald ! What have you done ? He 's about to tell us right now . If OmniCo finds out the drink is flawed , the sale doesn 't go through . What 's going to happen to her ? The more you take in , the quicker it seems to take effect . And it 's seeping directly into her pores . I 'm afraid she 's not going to last very long . I 'm sorry . None of this should have happened . The deal should have gone through weeks ago . Then everything just got out of hand . You knew . You knew what we were putting out there could ... You killed Coach Tappon . Is it warm in here ? Or am I wearing 38 Snuggies ? Most of them died because they drank too much . It was never safe . You just thought you could get away before anyone noticed . I didn 't know how it worked . How long does she have ? I don 't know . I 'm sorry . Based on how quickly she 's reacting , I 'd guess an hour , maybe two . We have to act quickly . I 'm not letting anyone else get hurt by this . What do we do ? Amino acids . The amino acids may have made contact with the metal and amped up the powers of the original ladle . I did a lot of research on the subject of amino acids for Doctor Moreau . Let me have a look . Perhaps I can cobble together an antidote . But that was 115 years ago . And I doubt amino acids have changed a great deal since then . Hey ! You 're going to take Agent Wells to your lab and you 're going to assist her now . I didn 't want any of this . Then this is your lucky day , Gerald , because we 're giving you a chance to get it all sorted . Come on . Okay , I need something that slows down the burning process . I 'll put something together . Okay . Any change ? No , she 's burning up . I 'm fighting a losing battle . She doesn 't have much time . I hope you have something . I hope so , too . Claudia , I 'm afraid this won 't taste very good . I know one mission won 't change your mind . I 'm not expecting miracles overnight . Just keep an open mind . Hey , you . Hey . How do you feel ? Did I combust ? No . If that guy made me combust , I 'm going to be pissed . Oh , thank God . Here , let 's just sit you up . Oh , that 's easy for you to say . Okay ? You should really thank H.G. She ... You were being wheeled out ... I don 't care if I 'm having a brain transplant . You cross paths with H.G. Wells , you yank me out of anesthesia and you fill me in . Is that understood ? I 'm really glad she showed up . She saved my life . Mine , too . Well , MacPherson saved my life countless times . It didn 't change who he was . Is that understood ? Yes , sir . Crystal clear . Ah ! Artie , are you ... Good work on the ladle . Yeah . I think I 'm going to go to bed . Apparently falling into a vat of bubbling poison kind of takes it out of you . Claudia , wait , I have something for you . College admissions for South Dakota University . There are some online courses in there , too . So , why the parental shove ? Well , you need a college degree to apply for the Secret Service . Right . Right . Okay . Thanks for being so hard on me out there . Turns out you can take it . So I 'm going to go back to the Warehouse , do you want to come ? No , no , no . I got a date with Kelly possibly . Yeah . Oh . I thought she turned you down . Oh , no , no . She did . She did . I just figured , you know , sometimes people can surprise you . Yeah , I guess sometimes they do . You should be resting . This is resting for me . Okay . I rush all the way back to remove an appendix for my favorite patient but apparently he did start without me . Mmm . Yeah . Take a long time to recover without you , too . Not if you work your meridians . I 'll tap all the meridians . Even the ticklish ones . You can have the next one . I promise . Oh , thank you . I 'm honored . Well , until next year , then . Vanessa . I 've been thinking that , you know , sometimes , I can be kind of obnoxious in a really fun and entertaining way and since it 's already come up , you did mention that I was cute . Although , now that I think about it , bunny rabbits and kittens are cute , so maybe it wasn 't the compliment that I thought it was . Look , I 'm just heading into town . Do you want to come with me for a little walk ? Or a sit ? Yeah , I 'd like that . Good . But I 'll drive . Yeah , you better . But here 's the thing , I like you when you 're not being really unnecessarily mean to me . And I need to eat , you know , and I figured , oh , your species probably occasionally eats , too . So maybe the two of us could sit down at the same table together and both eat . Fine . Eating at the same table . But nothing more and don 't get any ideas . I almost never do . Chinese place on Main and we 're going Dutch . Couldn 't we go to the Dutch place on Fifth and go Chinese ? Come on , slappy , before I change my mind . Hey , so when you said I was cute , did you mean like kitten and bunny rabbits cute ?

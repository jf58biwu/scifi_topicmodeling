 Previously on Heroes . My name is Samuel . I 'm the one who sent you the cello . It 's found its proper home . You can bring people to you . Like a siren 's song . - Compass ? - That seems to be the key component in the mystery . Enough for them to kill for . He 's going to tell me everything he knows about the carnival . We 're gonna isolate Samuel here . The problem , of course , is finding it . But our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . First , you have to disappear for eight more weeks . Well , then , we 'll have to agree to disagree , Hiro . Must rescue Watson ... Beam me up , Scotty - - We must go to the land of the swamp dragons ... and find the Castle ! That is how we will rescue Dr Watson ! You want to go to a place called Arkham in Florida ? The craziness of the last few weeks is finally over . Sylar 's gone . - Who is she ? - Vanessa . The love of my life . I haven 't seen her around here . She 's out there . I 'm afraid she 'll reject me for who I am , for what I 've done . You 're still her father . You 're the only one she has left , and she needs you . You know , the thing about burnt bridges is they can be rebuilt . Look at her . How do I explain to her about the world without dampening her spirits ? Now she sees it filled with promise and hope . As bright as the light in her eyes . But I 've lived long enough to know that everything is not as it appears . Evil does exist . People do terrible things to one another . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Noah . Noah ? I 'm still your brother . How do I protect her without losing her ? Hasn 't your father lied , cheated , even killed to protect you ? How do I build a bridge between us ... You lied to me . We shouldn 't have done it . ... when the distance seems so vast ? And I need time to grieve without being reminded why . So much for his eighth-grade class . Who 's next ? We 're getting down to childhood playmates , Noah . If that 's what it takes . All I 'm saying is , are you sure this is a productive use of our time ? Yes . - I gotta find this guy , Lauren . - And I want to help you , but we 've been shooting in the dark for like six hours now . You got a better idea , I 'm all ears . It 's just that you 're starting to sound a little ... Obsessed ? - You could call Claire . - Not an option . She has a compass , Noah . She can lead us right to ... lam not calling Claire . She 's angry at me right now . And frankly , she has every reason to be . She 's in no mood to help her old man . Well , maybe it 's time to patch things up . Maybe it 's time we found a useful lead . If you don 't want to help me you don 't have to . I 'm ... I 'm ... We got a hit on Vanessa Wheeler . - Who ? - She 's the one that I told you about . She grew up in the estate where his parents worked . The house that became a sinkhole . Looks like we have some still photos off a security camera . Is that your man ? That 's him . You got a phone number ? California area code . Hello ? - Vanessa Wheeler ? - Yes . Who 's calling ? My name is Bennet . Noah Bennet . I wanted to talk to you about Samuel Sullivan . What 's this about ? Just looking for him , and I 'm wondering if you 've heard from him lately . Fm sorry . I don 't know anybody by that name Really ? Because he grew up on the estate that your family owned . Looks like I 'm going to California . Yeah . Good luck with that . - Lauren ... - Good night . Lydia . - Just writing a letter . - Anybody I know ? I 'm running low on ink supplies . If you 're going into town tomorrow , I need you to pick some things up . Of course . Lydia , I know much has happened lately that 's difficult . Edgar . Hiro . Claire Bennet . Joseph . Not to mention Sylar . I 'm asking for your patience . I need you on my side . We 're so close now to realising all our dreams . Our dreams , Samuel ? Or are they yours ? I made a list . Indigo . Umber . Linseed oil ... - She 's beautiful . - Don 't worry . You 'll meet her soon enough . I 've waited along , long time to bring her . The day has finally come . You don 't trust him , do you ? He 's planning something big . I don 't like it . He 's always been good to me . I don 't know why you want to cause trouble . If this family is going to survive , we are going to need a new leader . - Like who ? - There is someone . A man of compassion . Samuel himself said that he may be the next Joseph . But he 's just so far away . Well , maybe you can call him . Maybe I can . - Is Matty still asleep ? - Yeah . He was up so late watching Ratatouille . Speaking of which , tonight , for dinner , - ratatouille . - Really ? Yeah . I 'm looking at it . I mean , it 's really not that hard . You know , my brother called yesterday . He 's still looking to hire someone . You don 't know of anyone , do you ? No . I mean , I told you before , I don 't know any software salesmen . You see , he doesn 't need a computer guy . Just someone who 's smart , focused , and , you know , looking to get ahead . - You don 't like my cooking ? - Matt , I love your cooking . But you want me to work for your brother . Seriously ? Honey , your brother ? I 'm just worried about you . Since you got back , you hardly leave the house . Well , I 'm a stay-at-home-dad guy . That 's what I do . - What 's wrong with that ? - Nothing . I just want you to be happy . There 's stay-at-home because you want to and then there 's stay-at-home because you 're scared not to , and I just don 't know which one you are . I 'm the one who is really excited about this ratatouille recipe , which , by the way , will be ready at 6 : 30 p.m. sharp . Honey , I 'm really happy . I am . Just being here , taking care of you and Matty . Okay . Have a good day . Go make some money , will you ? Hello , Matt . - Bennet . - I thought I 'd check your security system . Seems you 're not as safe as you think . - Okay . - I 've left you five messages . What do you want , Bennet ? I need your help . Have you ever heard of a guy named Samuel Sullivan ? No . But even if I had ... The last time I helped you I got Sylar stuck in my head and I almost died . - You remember that ? - It 's nasty out there , Matt . But shoving your head in the sand doesn 't make the world go away . Yeah . Well , you never know until you try , do you ? I 'm sorry about what you 've been through . The Sylar thing was a terrible idea . We all admit that . Look , I stay home and lock my doors . I don 't see why that has to change . Because this Sullivan guy , he 's a very bad man . Well , so is bin Laden . But you 're gonna have to do better than that . He 's trying to recruit my daughter . Okay , what 's your plan ? You 're gonna go kick this guy in the teeth instead of talking to your daughter ? I 'm sorry . Today , it 's Claire . Tomorrow , it could be your son . What was I thinking ? Having you committed ... Your brain is scrambled , you don 't have your powers ... Once you 're inside , it won 't be easy to get you out . Sancho , we must liberate Dr Watson . All right , time to kiss bye-bye . Patients only past the double doors . Sancho , Arkham , Dr Watson ... I wish I knew what any of this meant . Can 't I at least see him to his room ? Make sure he 's comfortable ? Comfortable ... Come on , pal . Let 's get you strapped in . - What ? - Just an expression . It 's Dr Watson ! It 's Dr Watson ! Hiro ? Ahmadi ? " Dr Watson " is Suresh . - How long are these rehearsals , anyway ? - I have no idea . Okay . So she plays the cello . She 's in the LA Chamber Orchestra and she 's first chair . So , what is she , Samuel 's girlfriend or something ? Well , that 's what you 're here for , Matt . - That 's her right there . - Looks like rehearsal 's over . - Jump in any time . - What ? No , no. no . Hey , I never ... - Vanessa Wheeler ? - Do I know you ? I 'm Noah Bennet . We spoke on the phone briefly . I called you about Samuel Sullivan . I thought I was clear . I told you , I don 't know him . Yeah , but the problem is , we know that you do because we have pictures of the two of you . - Are you with the police ? - No . It 's more complicated than that . Is there somewhere we could go and sit down and talk for a minute ? Look , whoever you are , just , please , leave me alone . Well , hang on just a second . Have you met my friend Matt Parkman ? No . And I don 't want to . Matt , you want to share any thoughts here , please ? Noah , I told you ... You can trust us , Vanessa . You want to talk to us . You know , come to think of it , I 'm glad you called . I need to talk to someone . I 'm worried about him . Hey , Noah , it 's Peter . Look . That ... That tattoo on my arm , it showed up again . Give me a call , all right ? Bye . Yes ! - Emma ? - It worked . I 'm sorry . What worked ? I brought you here with music . I just had to think of you , and it worked . I 'm sorry . Please , come in . I met an unusual man , and he showed me a new side to my ability , using this . Where did you get this cello ? That same man . He 's the one who sent it to me . Who ? What 's his name ? Samuel . Why ? I woke up this morning with this . They were good years , growing up . He used to write me these poems , these little love poems . We were close . Neither of us cared that his family lived in the carriage house on my family 's property or that his father called my father " Sir . " One day , I came home and they were gone . I moved on with my life . I assumed he moved on with his . But he hadn 't . He showed up in my room one night , all swagger and rock ' n ' roll . I was just in the right place for the " bad boyfriend . " We had a wild couple of weeks until he asked me to marry him and run off to his carnival . I mean , a carnival ? I was getting a music degree at Yale . Van 8838 he 's not that 20-year-old kid any more . Samuel Sullivan is a very dangerous man . Well , lately , he has been showing up more and more often . Since his brother died , ifs gotten even worse . Just shows up spouting all kinds of crazy things . So he 's stalking you ? That 's not the word I would choose , but he does seem ... Obsessed ? A week ago , he was waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building , going on and on about how much he misses me , how we 'll be together once I see how powerful he 's become . It was 2 : 00 in the morning . So he knows where you live and you know how to reach him ? I 've been banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to find the carnival , maybe we bring the carnival to us . Okay . How do you move a carnival ? Do us a favour . Call him . Is this the guy that gave you the cello ? You said his name was Samuel ? Yes . You know him ? He told me his name was William Hooper . What did he want from you ? He didn 't want anything . Just to find a homeless man . - That 's it ? - Yes . He gave me something . This . Emma , the last time I saw a compass like this my friend got stabbed . You think Samuel ... If there 's any connection to that , I 'd keep my distance from him . Peter , he 's a good man . Emma , my friend almost died because of a compass just like that . And it wasn 't the first person that got attacked . Delmonico 's for lunch . Well , maybe it 'll be too crowded . How about Moxie ? Hi , Mom . Emma , this is my mother , Angela . Nice to meet you . - Mom , this is Emma . - Peter , how do you know this woman ? Emma is my friend . I need to get to work . Bye , Peter . I 'll call you later . What the hell was that ? So this has been about saving Dr Suresh , all along . As I 've been telling you , Sancho Panza ! Hiro , lam so relieved . That your mind ... That you 're not really crazy . I 've misjudged you once again . But Dr Suresh has super-strength ... Why hasn 't he broken out ? The storm troopers ... The orderlies ... Have dulled his senses with Jawa Juice . He 's been drugged . We must turn Bruce Banner back into the Hulk ! You 've done well so far . Now leave it to me . Ahmadi . - How 's it going ? - All good . You better not be messing with my meds . No . I was just admiring your cart . Very nice . I work in a cart factory . - You 're the Japanese guy 's friend . - Yes . I 'm Buck . Excuse me . I 'm Chuck . Yeah . Well , take it easy . Uh oh ... Nap time for Sancho . He 's late . We 're pretty exposed here , Noah . So when he shows , we gotta hustle . Taser and some duct tape and we 're out in 60 seconds . You getting a hit on the chip in her pocket ? Yeah . It 's all good . - We have our target . - What ? Well , he didn 't come past me . He must 've come around the back . - And , let 's go . - Copy that . Hello , Bennet . Hey , can I ask you a question ? No ... Hey , what was that ? - The alley . Get the car ! - Got it . Samuel Sullivan ! Where is she ? Stay away from her , Bennet . - Where is she ? - She 's already gone . What the hell happened to you ? All right . She 's headed south on Normandie . Let 's go . You had a dream . There 's nothing you can do to save her . You need to save yourself . I 'm sorry . Mom , half this family is dead . Their bodies are surrounded with lies . It 's down to you and me . Are we ever going to get this right ? Please just tell me the truth . For once in your life , Mom , please . The dream was foggy . The message was not . - She 's going to help kill people . - That 's wrong . Mom , that 's not possible , okay ? She 's a good person . Peter , she 's going to kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . A cello . Something to do with a cello . - Tell me exactly what you saw . - I told you , it doesn 't matter . The important thing is that you cannot save her . But someone else can . Is that it ? I 'm sorry . I need to know . People think that dreaming the future is a gift . They 're wrong . Dr Watson ? Dr Watson ? Hiro ? Dr Watson , I have travelled over great ocean to free you . Where am I ? - You put me here . - To be continued . Beware the storm troopers . Why are you talking like that , Hiro ? Warp speed , Dr Watson . We must rescue Sancho and escape . Sancho ? The prisoners have all gone to dinner . I 've hidden Sancho for his safety . Ando ? What 's happened to him ? He partook the absinthe intended for you , Dr Watson . Perfect . One who can 't walk , one who can 't talk . They must have searched my cell . We gotta go . We shall ride to freedom . What 's happening ? It 's like swimming , but inside out . I 'm swimming ! Full speed , Captain . Hey ! Get back in your cages ! - Storm troopers . - There they are . It 's okay . I got this . What the ... She 's here . She 's right here . The carnival was here . Yeah . Well , it isn 't here now . They had a two-minute lead on us . An entire carnival doesn 't just disappear . This one does . - Well , how did Claire find it ? - Gotta have a compass . Okay , so you 're saying she got that from the Samuel guy ? No . She got it from me . Great . Okay , well , let 's go back to Claire then ... It 's not gonna work that way . You 're burning bridges , Noah . You can 't talk to Claire any more . So tell me , how is it going to work , then ? I don 't know ! I don 't know . But we 're going to find it . Somehow . We have to . Lauren , it 's me . Just call me . I 'm running out of ideas here . Well , you know what ? I would love to sit and brainstorm with you , I really would , but I gotta make dinner . - Dinner ? - Yeah . Ratatouille . - What ? - Ratatouille . It 's French . It 's in the book . I know what ratatouille is . This woman 's been kidnapped . - That 's a Missing Persons case ... - And we have to find her . I don 't have a badge any more . Let the cops handle it . You 're gonna send cops up against specials ? They 're gonna get flayed alive . Look , I dragged her into this , I pulled her into the sunlight . Well , maybe she 's already crossed state lines , Noah . Look . Admit it , this is bigger than us . So what are you gonna do ? You 're just gonna lock your doors and crawl back into your shell ? You 're one of the good guys , Matt . You have a responsibility . You 're not a coward . You know ' some days maybe you just can 't save the whole world . Some days , you 're better off just getting your own house in order . Which means what ? Which means ... Go home . Hug your little girl . Don 't worry . I 've come to save you . Hi . - What are you doing ? - I 'm sorry . - What is wrong with you ? - Let me explain . I have these dreams that come true and I had one about you and that cello . You broke my cello because you had a dream ? No , because a lot of people are gonna die , Emma . Your friend , Samuel , that compass that you have , my tattoo , they 're all connected to this cello . Not the cello ! And we have to make sure to stop that dream from happening . That 's why I broke the cello , okay ? Something bad is going to happen . I want you out . Now ! I 'm sorry . Goodbye , Peter . I think that way is west . We must away , before the storm troopers are upon us . I have had just about enough of your nonsense , Hiro . After what you did to me , I have half a mind to leave you lost in this swamp forever . Hey . Don 't talk to him like that . Hiro 's got very little time left and he chose to spend it rescuing you . You should be thankful . He 's a hero . What do you mean " little time " ? The reaper waits for no man . He 's dying The storm troopers and their Ewoks . Hurry . Are you sure he can 't teleport ? No . Not unless we unscramble his brain . Hey , what would they have done at that hospital ? Probably electroshock therapy . Hiro . - Why are we stopping ? - Electroshock therapy . - What ? You want me ... - Even if we evade them we could be wandering out here for days . We need to teleport out of here . - How ? - You can use your red lightning . Look , Hiro once saw a future where I killed him with my red lightning . - Was it in Florida ? - Japan . Then we 're good to go . Make it so , Sancho . Hiro . Ando , Dr Suresh , we must stop Samuel Sullivan . Hiro , you 're back . Yes . And now we must get going . - Dad ? - Hey' I 'm sorry to bother you . I was just in the neighbourhood . Really ? No . No . I was in California . I just landed , bags are still in the car . Listen , I know that you 're mad at me and I 'm okay with that . And I wanna just let you be mad at me . I don 't wanna try to talk you out of anything - or to try to convince you of anything ... - Dad , what are you doing here ? Are you all right ? Yeah . Yeah . I 'm good . I 'm great , actually . I 'm just ... - I 've been thinking about bridges . - Bridges ? Bridges that connect us to the people and things that we love and need in our lives that are built on trust , and I 've ... I 've torched most of them . And I 'm just hoping that the one that connects me to you can still be repaired . I 'm sorry , but I do have something that I 'm late for Okay . - Can we talk about this later ? - Yeah . Yeah . We 'll talk about it later . This thing that you 're late for , do you need a lift ? No . No , I 'm good . Okay . So I 'll ... - I 'll see you later ? - Yeah . I 'll see you later . I didn 't think a law office could be such a soap opera . I mean , the human drama of it all . Matt , you remember my boss , Pressman ? So he 's totally gay , he 's totally in denial , and he 's totally married . Okay . Matt , this is delicious . So how about you ? Did you leave the house at all today ? Do you think I 'm a coward ? What ? I 'm a coward . What are you talking about ? Why ? I had the worst guy in the world living inside my head . When I finally got rid of him , I didn 't do a thing to go after him . Because you came home to us , where you belong . I 've let so many people down . Who ? Friends . People that I care about . I mean , I 'm sitting here eating ratatouille instead of facing the world , doing something about the problems that I 've caused . Matt , you have a family . Come on , you 're a simple guy . You care about us . That 's your world . You just have to let the rest of it be . There is nothing cowardly about looking after your family . You belong here . With us . Okay ? Yeah . Come here . Not exactly five-star accommodations , I know but if there 's anything you need ... What I need is to go home , Samuel . What are you doing ? You can 't just take me . I 've thought about this day for so long , Vanessa . The day you would arrive . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . Everything was supposed to be perfect . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Noah Bennet . He did a real number on you , didn 't he ? He got in your head . I had to act to protect you , to get you away from him . BY kidnapping me ? I would hardly say that . You won 't let me leave here , you 've got me against my will , what would you call it ? You know what ? I 'm just ... You 're upset . And I understand why . But there is a reason for all of this . There 's something I want you to see . So magical , so beautiful . Just lei me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you right back to California . I promise . What do you mean , " right back to California " ? Sam , where are we ? It 's so beautiful , Vanessa . Wait till you see it . It 's perfect . I was driving by , I saw the light on . Come on in . How was California ? Not as fruitful as I would have liked . - You got my messages ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry . I know . And I think I ... I care for you more than I want to admit . And it 's complicated . I know . Just don 't do ii again . You have company . Sorry to pop in like this . Hello , boys .

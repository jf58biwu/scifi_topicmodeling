 Put everything in the bags . Oh , the coffin 's here . Put it here , on the small table . There you are . Come on . That 's it . Now put him in here . Carefully , eh ? That 's another one who can be buried properly , eh ? Only another ... 98,137 to go . Oh dear , is that the time already ? Time flies , doesn 't it ? Don 't forget there 's no school tomorrow , kids . See you Monday , Miss . And tell your mom and dad to make sure they make the right choice on Sunday . Hello . Allow me to introduce our newest friend , Porki . This pig robot was specially designed for you , modern pig breeders . Hello , Porki . This machine makes your work easier . From now on , no more messing around in your pigsty , no more crazy antics to get your sows pregnant . Yes , Porki , yes . Look at that , isn 't it wonderful ? We 're putting progress into operation . One press of this button and Porki does his job . This robotic computer works using smell and sound recognition . The smell the robot gives off stimulates your pigs ' pheromones , so that a spontaneous desire to reproduce is awakened . Your sow will interpret the computer 's grunting as a mating grunt , as a result of which she will be sexually receptive . SCIENTIFIC CAMERA Thanks to Porki your fertility problems are a thing of the past . Thank you , who ? Thank you , Porki . Hey , Porki , don 't you listen to me any more ? Com.Sales is doing extremely well . Because , for Com.Sales there is no substitute for ... Victory ! - No substitute for ... victory ! One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . One , two , three , four , five . Victory ! My friends , you are going to sell your friend Porki to the biggest pig breeders in the Benelux . How are we going to do that ? Via an incredible competition with very simple rules . Whoever sells the most Porkies ... wins . Whoever sells the fewest , loses . The winner will receive an extra year 's pay , this amazing wheel with the accompanying All-Wheel Drive Crossover Convertible ... And , hold on , possibly the most important thing of all ... a kiss from Katja . Whoever loses , will be sacked immediately and his salary paid to the winner . The competition will run for 3 nights and 3 days and end Sunday evening , precisely . And , my dear friends , it will start ... now ! Go ! And Friesland , go . And Limburg , go . The Kempen , go . And go , go , go ! Mr Fierens , does it really have to be this weekend ? Yeah , well , it 's your choice , Tony . Do you want to be a winner or a loser ? Let me see . Westhoek ? Tony Roozen , lucky you , that 's a pig paradise . Come on , go , go , go . That 's the spirit , Tony . And remember , the jungle is dark but it 's full of diamonds . Fuck , Andy ! - What 's the matter ? I 'm supposed to go to the Ardennes with Bea and her parents . What 's the problem ? I was going to officially ask her to marry me . Yabba-Dabba , motherfucker ! Congratulations . Now Fierens has come up with the competition . What do I do ? Ask her a week later . She 's not going anywhere . Nor are the Ardennes . A car and a year 's pay are at stake . If you 've got to choose between the jackpot or the Ardennes , I know what I 'd choose . - Fuck ! You 're right . Of course I 'm right , I 'm a pig farmer . And a pig farmer is always right . Do something about that outfit , pal . Hello , new best friend . Hi , it 's Bea . Leave a message . I 'll definitely call you back Bye-bye . Bea , it 's me . I 'm coming to the Ardennes but I 'll be a bit late . I have to take part in a competition at work . Another of Fierens ' ideas . Maybe you can go to the Ardennes with your parents in their car ? Can you call me ? Bye ... Oh yeah , there are some great prizes to be won . Triple kiss . Bye-bye . Oh , Tony . - Hi , baby . Tony , please , tell me I misunderstood you . What 's this about a competition ? - I don 't have a choice . Don 't you have respect for anyone ? My parents are really looking forward to it . Dad 's even taking his banjo . What have you got to say to that ? - Do you think I 'm happy about it ? We have to sell pigs , well , no , robots , actually ... and whoever sells the most pigs , wins . - Wins what ? A luxury car ... A convertible . Really ? - Yes . And an extra year 's pay . So when are you coming to the Ardennes ? - Tomorrow evening . If all goes well . Make sure that all goes well , eh ? You 've got to win , Tony . That 's the idea , losing 's not an option . As long as you know . If you lose , you can stay there . I 'm going to win , darling . For us . So , is it OK ? - Yes . Triple kiss ? - Triple kiss . Take the E40 highway . Take the first exit in the direction of Westhoek Now turn right . Follow this road for 300 meters . Now turn left . Now turn right . You are on a non-digitized road . Turn round . You are on a non-digitized road . - Oh no ! Come on ! Turn round . Oh , fuck ! Oh , fuck . Hello ? Hello ? Bloody hell ! Sir ! Excuse me . Sir ! Excuse me , sir . Excuse me . Could you tell me where I am , please ? In Madonna , as they call it . - Where ? Madonna . I ... I 'm looking for a hotel . Are you a sales traveler ? Yes . Tony Roozen , Com.Sales. " No substitute for victory . " I 'm looking for a room for the night . I 've had an accident with my van . You can stay at Gusta 's , Under the Lime Tree . Oh , and where 's that ? Well , next to the lime tree ... Where the lime tree used to be . But it was hit by lightning in ' 03 . Three euros . Sorry ? - Admission is three euros . I haven 't come to see the museum , sir . I 'm looking for someone to help me . I 've had an accident . I drove my van into a ditch . You looked in through the window . So that 's three euros . Now I 'd like to ask you to get off my property . The museum is about to close . Hello , madam . I need to make an urgent phone call . Madam ? I 've had enough . It 's too ridiculous for words . Come back , Maria . It 's an open debate . Everyone is entitled to their opinion . - You listen to one another in a debate . What do they take me for ? - You 're being unreasonable . Unreasonable ? - Unreasonable . Now you know . My school has ten pupils left . If one more leaves , it 'll have to close . That 's the end of your village , Mr Mayor . Worry about that instead . And come out from behind my bar . I 'm not having a private discussion with you . So may I ask you politely to come back to the meeting ? You 're a member of our panel , some degree of responsibility is required . Hello ... Could you help me ? I ... - Just a moment . Gusta , I 'm going to have a beer . I 'll write it down . A moment , yeah ... Right , to get back to the agenda . Just before our charming village school teacher 's emotional outburst we had reached the final item , Other Business . We haven 't actually achieved a thing . There 's a request from Brussels and Europe to widen the old road to Madonna and turn the crossroads into a roundabout . That request is being ignored by the local council because the mayor and his pals would rather have a new main road , from the coast to Madonna , through the battlefields . Do you know why ? So their fields will be compulsorily purchased in order to make them more money . That 's a load of rubbish . - It isn 't . That 's a load of rubbish and you know it . We 're not ignoring anything . The request from Brussels isn 't unreasonable but maybe there are other alternatives that they wouldn 't think of in Brussels but that we , the local authority , would because of our experience in the field . But this is a real democracy here . So we 're going to vote on it on Sunday . Anyway , Miss , seeing as you are so concerned about your school and our village emptying , you should vote for the new road . Because that new road will improve access to our village and attract new families and , listen , new pupils . That will take at least ten years , Your Worship . We don 't have that . And battlefields mustn 't be sacrificed for a new road . The battlefields . There she goes again . - I agree , I agree . If we have to wait till the plans for a new main road have been approved by Europe 's officials , it 'll be too late . The English will never agree to us laying a new road through their battlefields . Their fallen soldiers are there . No , we should opt to widen the old road . Persyn , you 're only against our proposal because your petrol station is on the old road and you won 't benefit from a new main road . I have to think of my business . You don 't get something for nothing . I can understand that , seeing as you are a businessman , but the fact that you , as a businessman , refuse to do your job by not supplying your fellow villagers with petrol or other lubricants and make everyone 's life here unnecessarily complicated , making it difficult for us ... refusing to do that is what I call blackmail . He 's right , you know . I 'm not refusing . I 'm on strike . It 's a one-man campaign . It 's nothing but blackmail . - Calm down , Roger . That junction , where that statue is , is a triangle . And the only thing Europe is asking us to do is to turn that junction into a roundabout and widen the old road . It isn 't a triangle . The Madonna junction isn 't a triangle . Those corners aren 't points . A triangle without points ... Miss , as a school teacher you should know what a triangle without points is . It 's a circle ! That Madonna is going to stay there . She 's stood there all her life and she 's going to stay there . Roger , that roundabout is triangular . It 's a triangle . We can 't deny it . It is , in fact , a hexagon . If I could , I 'd go on strike with Persyn , but I don 't want to let your children down . This debate is a waste of time . I have work to do . - What did she say ? She 's off . She 's off again . That 's easy . - In her case that 's insubordination . Calm down , Roger . - Right . I 'm going to try to explain it one more time . The widening of the old road is the least painful solution . And if that statue has to stand on a roundabout instead of at a crossroads , so be it . So I 'm sticking to my guns . As long as there is opposition , I 'm not supplying anyone with petrol . No one . Who doesn 't agree can go to Ypres , 30 km away . And another thing , if the vote goes against it Sunday , I 'm setting fire to my pumps and I 'm out of here . If threats are going to be made , we 'd better stop . We 're going to stop . Sunday 's referendum will decide . There you go , Gusta . Are you the garage owner ? Yes . Passed down from father to son , for more than fifty years . What are you doing here ? My work , I 'm a sales rep . Com.Sales ... " No substitute for victory . " I didn 't go to school for that long . - A sales traveler . A sales traveler ? Do you want to sell me something ? No , no , no , I 've driven my van into a ditch . I thought maybe you could help me and pull me out . Where did it happen ? On the road near that statue of Madonna , by that ... triangular roundabout . Now he 's going on about a triangle too . It hasn 't got any corners , has it ? That 's a roundabout , eh ? - That 'll do . You must be a real idiot if you drove into that ditch . I was a bit disoriented . I thought I saw a soldier jump in front of my van , turned my wheel and ended up in the ditch . A soldier ? The last one to see soldiers here was Gusta . Eh , Gusta ? How long ago was it that you saw soldiers ? In 1917 ? Eh ? When your Prosper went to the front ? That 's a long time ago , so if you saw a soldier , you don 't need a mechanic , you need a doctor . Here , Your Worship , I 've got a customer for you . No one here is laughing at your jokes , Persyn . Maybe that 's because you 're not joking . I don 't need your help , doctor . - The mayor is a vet . He pretends he 's a doctor after work . An amateur gynecologist . Hey , Persyn , you 've been warned . I 'll tell you what ... Buy me a snifter and I 'll pull you out tomorrow , OK ? Miss , a glass of snifter , please . Thanks . Five euros . Right . Hey , lad , where are you going to sleep ? They told me there would be a room here . That 's true . But you 're going to have to ask Gusta nicely first , you young colt . Room seven . Up the stairs . You can 't miss it , there 's only one room . Thanks . I just have to fetch a few things ... What a strange guy ! - He 's gone . What a really strange guy ! You must be stupid to end up in the ditch . He was fiddling with ... That isn 't a triangle , is it ? - No , Roger , no ... Goodnight . Are you sure you don 't want to sleep in your bed ? It 's late , he 's not going to come any more , is he ? Right then . God bless you and keep you , Gusta . See you tomorrow morning . Who locked this ? Right then . Hey , pal , take it easy , take it easy . There 's no need to be scared . You mustn 't lock that . Our Gusta has to be able to get to the bathroom at night , see ? It 's me again . There , that 's better . Do you mind if I smoke a pipe ? There . They say smoking isn 't good for you . But living isn 't either , because you end up dead . Look at me . I hope there isn 't too much damage to your car . You made me jump . Normally people can 't see me , but you obviously can . I thought you overreacted a bit . You could have killed yourself . Those motorized vehicles are dangerous , you know . You need to be careful with them . I remember an attack on Dikkebusch , 18 September 1917 . The Prussians had obviously received a new load of ammunition and they wanted to try it out on us , of course . Hour after hour , grenades raining down on us . Shrapnel flying past our ears . Florent , my pal , was lying next to me . His last day at the front . And , would you believe it ? A grenade landed on him . The bottom half of his body was ripped from the top half . In two bits . His intestines , his stomach , everything , was floating in a pool of blood . And he looked at me , what was left of him , and he said , " Prosper , shoot me . " I said , " Florent ... " " Go on , shoot me . " And I drew my gun ... but before I could shoot him , he was dead . And then all that machinery , the tanks , appeared . That was also a new invention . They wanted to try that out on us too . They drove right over Florent , over all the bits . His head got stuck in the caterpillartracks . I thought , that 's not right , so I crawled behind the tanks and tried to pry his head out of the caterpillartracks but my arm suddenly got stuck and I lost it . My arm . I 'm going to go now . I can see you 're tired . I 'll let you get some sleep . Lay on the left side of the bed , there are too many springs that can stick in your back on the right side . Goodnight , my friend . The button activates the pheromone stimulators which , thanks to the Aeroflex speakers , produce a natural sound . The robot has a state-of-the-art SV-54 smell diffusion system with a refillable cartridge . Press button C. Press button C. The robot can be connected to the outlets via a cord that is supplied separately . The robot can be connected to the outlets via a cord that is supplied separately . Good morning . Oh , good morning . What do I owe you ? 250 euro . - 250 euro ? Breakfast included . That 's not exactly cheap for a small room like that . Is there something wrong with the room ? - No , no . It 's just that you 'd expect a bit more luxury for that price . You can 't exactly describe that room as special . Did it have to be special ? Shall I tell you something ? Madonna , the singer , slept there in 1980 . Is that special enough ? Madonna ? Upstairs ? Yes . Upstairs . In room seven . In your bed . She was a background dancer . With Patrick Hernandez . - OK ... Deal . I slept well , although ... I had a bit of a strange dream about a soldier . What did you dream ? Oh , nothing , nothing . I often have strange dreams . Especially when I 'm hungry . Our pork brawn is the best in the area . Madonna is crazy about it . She regularly has five kilos sent to America . Doesn 't she live in England ? - Does it matter where she lives ? If Madonna prefers to have it sent to America , that 's her business . Oh , right . Yes , of course . Very nice . Right ... I 've got to go now , Gusta . I 'll come and get you this afternoon . Do you take credit cards ? I can pay cash but I 'd like to hang on to my bills . Only cash . Leave it on the bar when you go . OK , I will , Miss . - Maria . Tony . Right , adieu . What ? - See you later , maybe . Oh no , I 'm leaving for the Ardennes . Once my van 's been pulled out of the ditch , I 'll be off . Right . Toodle-oo . Oh , him there . Good morning . Is there a hotspot for my iPhone here anywhere ? Hotspot , what 's that ? - A what ? A hotspot . For my iPhone . Are you on steroids or something ? - No . But I need to make an urgent phone call . What do you think that phone booth is there for ? Hello . I 've come to get my van pulled out of the ditch . I 'm on strike . - Pardon ? I 'm on strike . Yesterday you said ... - Yesterday was yesterday , today is today . A strike can 't be predicted . If you don 't help me , I will lose my job and my future wife too , maybe . Then I 've got good news . There may be a vacancy for a pump attendant soon . And if you lose your wife you can have mine . Are you going to help me ? - No , I 'm on strike . If I don 't show solidarity with myself , I can 't ask others to . You look like you didn 't sleep very well . Listen ... I 'll give you 300 euros to forget your principles for 10 minutes and start up your towtruck and help me . Then you can carry on striking . Is there a hole in the wall here ? - A what ? A cash dispenser . In Ypres , 30 km away . 30 km ... How can I leave today then ? You can 't . Not until after the referendum . But that 's too late for me . Look , the referendum is officially planned for Sunday , you can 't change that . What if the vote doesn 't go the way you want ? I 'll set fire to my pumps and they can all kiss my ass . Then you 'll be in luck , there will be a vacancy . What ? Feel the power , Tony . The jungle is dark but it 's full of diamonds . To war ! What do you think of that ? The guided tour starts next door . - I 've come about something else . Come on . Hold on . Take a seat . Come on . Come on , come on . Close your eyes . Open your eyes . I don 't need any modern art in my museum . It 's not modern art . It 's a machine that is going to change the art of pig breeding . Anyway , talking of modern , I can see you 're an enlightened farmer . We like that at Com.Sales. Take a good look . That animal is going to change your life . Let that pig loose in your sty and your boars will perform like never before . Your sows will get pregnant ... just like that . It is very easy to use . You just sit in your chair , press the button on the remote control and ... off it goes . It makes a natural mating sound thanks to its Aeroflex speakers and it has a state-of-the-art SV-54 smell diffusion system with a cartridge . Supplied separately at a very interesting price . You can connect him to the outlets using this cable . But you won 't need to do that very often as the battery lasts at least two weeks . I can see that you realize that this is the future . So I 'm prepared to do something special for you . You can have Porki for a one month trial period ... free of charge . I 'm saying it quietly because my boss mustn 't hear it . Understand ? And if you sign a contract now , you get a 20 % discount the first year . And 20 % the second year too . What do you say to that ? I don 't have pigs any more . I don 't have my pigs . What about that barn ? - Empty . Completely empty . Well , full of junk . But no pigs . That isn 't actually open to the public yet . Let 's go for it . You say it 's modern ? And I can have it for a one month trial period ? And then a 20 % discount three years in a row . What do you think , Berta ? - WII it work , Pol ? What do you think ? Do you really think I 'd come all the way from Brussels to sell you something that didn 't work ? 300 euro is a lot of money , of course . - We 'll do a deal . We 'll go to your barn now . I 'll switch my pig on . If there is no result within five minutes , I 'll give you 100 euro . Cash . You 'll see . Within five minutes your barn 's windows will be ... steamed up . Five minutes . 100 euro . Alright then . We 'll do that . I always say you have to move with the times . Five minutes . And ... start ! Where are your pigs ? Hanging up in a fridge somewhere . Europe pays me to leave my barns empty . Why didn 't you tell me ? - You didn 't ask . Your five minutes are almost up . I can 't see any steamed-up windows yet . And stop . Five minutes exactly . Hi , baby . - Tony ! About time . I 've been trying to call you for ages . I can 't get a signal in this backwater . You 've got one now . - I 'm in a phone booth , with coins . Oh , listen carefully , my father 's playing his banjo . Oh , great . Great . It sounds good . - Don 't disappoint him . No , no , no , I 'm coming . I 'm definitely coming . I 'll just be a bit late , I think ... tomorrow at the latest . What do you mean , tomorrow ? No , Mom , I 'll figure it out . Baby , you promised me you 'd ... - I know , baby , but I 'm stuck here , I 've had an accident . - An accident ? Are you hurt ? No , I 'm OK , you know me . My van needs to be repaired . Otherwise I 'll come to you . Where are you staying ? I 'm staying in a small hotel where Madonna once stayed . Have you snorted something ? No , seriously , the singer once slept in my bed . Baby , are you really alright ? Yes , I 'm alright . But I did have a strange dream . A strange dream ? What about ? About a dead soldier from World War One . Tony . There 's something wrong ... Hello ? Hello , Bea ? Baby ? Hello ? Hello ? Bea , hello ? Bloody hell ! Gusta , I 've got your dressing gown . So you haven 't left then ? Shall we get out ? No ... I 've decided not to leave until tomorrow . There 's a 100 euro discount from the second night , coffee and continental breakfast included . What is a continental breakfast ? A pork brawn sandwich . There is also a special local breakfast , that 's 8 euros extra . Oh , and what 's that ? Two pork brawn sandwiches . Right , Gusta , come on , let 's get out now . That 's it . Watch out . Sorry , but ... is there a restaurant around here anywhere ? There 's a place that does a table d 'hôte . Once outside , go straight ahead along Dorpsstraat , across the square to the church , through the graveyard , then with the church behind you and the school to your right , look left and you 'll see a small house . Go over to it , ring the bell and say I sent you . Make sure you 're there at nine on the dot , if you want something to eat . Come on , I 'll help you . Come here , Gusta , I 'll help you . Are you going to keep that shower hat on ? I 'm going to do your nails too . Watch out . Go on . Good evening . We have a dish of the day for 25 euros , drink included . Come in . Do you live here ? We 've got another guest this evening . My great-granny , Gusta . Maria , actually I wanted to ... - I have to check on the food . Maria , I ... How are you , is everything fine ? You made me jump ! Bloody hell ! Never seen a dead man before , I suppose ? Come with me . Straight ahead . You 're going to help me . I am definitely not crazy . I am not crazy . I 've been seeing Prosper 's ghost for years . He 's my great-grandpa . His bones are out in the fields amongst 100,000 other dead soldiers who 've never been dug up . But his ghost wanders around here and he pops in every evening at 9 . I tried talking to my doctor about it . He said it was nervous exhaustion and wanted to send me to the nut house . But you see him too , eh ? So he 's real . And you just walked through him . - No , no , no , calm down . Calm down . This is getting a bit too freaky for my liking . There 's too much iodine in the air here , it makes you hallucinate . I know it sounds ridiculous , but it 's true . Or LSD . The CIA carried out military tests with LSD in the fifties . They dropped LSD by plane on a village in France to see how people reacted . Tony , my great-granny doesn 't want to die until she 's found Prosper 's body and given him a decent burial . I 've been searching the battlefields for his bones for years . But to no avail up till now . That doesn 't mean I don 't appreciate her efforts , you know . On the contrary . But you need luck too . I 've already found ten bodies but not Prosper 's . And now his ghost walks around here , whistling . But I 'm sure his remains are out there somewhere . Absolutely , affirmative . If she could find my right arm for starters , it 'd be good . One arm 's impractical . There 's lots I can 't do . I was a good swimmer . They want to build a road through the battlefields . Tony , you 've got to help me and Gusta find Prosper . Before a bulldozer pulverizes him . I 'd really appreciate it . His bones must be here in a field somewhere . That reminds me of ... - Leave us alone for a moment . Hey , take it easy . All you need do is say so calmly . I know when I 'm not wanted . Easy , Tony , easy . Come on . You can hear a banjo , very quietly , and a gurgling river . Bea is putting the sleeping bags out . You throw some wood on the fire , then you 're going to ask Bea to marry you . Come on , come on . I think the food is ready . And he destroyed our phone booth . Seriously ? - Yes . That pig of his isn 't kosher . He went to see Nachtegaele too . - And what 's-his-name ... Vanwachtebeke . He tried to bribe him , with lots of money . Yeah , it 's ... there 's something that doesn 't add up . Roger , something 's wrong . Something 's wrong and now he 's at Maria 's . Now he 's at Maria 's , a beautiful girl . It 's a crying shame . Maria , as obstinate as her father , such a shame . You know what I think about it , eh ? You shouldn 't judge people by appearances . Never . That 's true , Roger . I love all my villagers equally . Yeah . Yeah . Every one of them . - That 's good . There 's something special about Maria . - No , Jean-Pierre . Something special . That 's like with sheep . What do you mean ? - Well , you love all your sheep equally too , eh ? But sometimes one stands out from the rest . That ... That only happened once . And it was simply an accident . That sheep was standing in front of me and fell on top of me . I 'm not suggesting anything . I didn 't know that you ... - That I what ? It 's nice . I don 't recognize the taste but it 's nice . Flemish ratatouille . Gusta 's favorite meal , eh Gusta ? Tripe with potatoes , boiled in coffee . Tripe ? Intestines . That reminds me . Did I tell you how I lost my arm ? It was ripped off by caterpillartracks . That took me by surprise . But there ... Those are things ... - You should eat something , Gusta . The Prussians ' grenades were raining down on our head . British tanks were behind us . So I thought , I 've got to do something . Then I jumped in a crater made by a grenade but I wasn 't the only one in it . There were two Prussians in it too . They obviously had the same idea , a few weeks before . It was an unusual sight . Let 's just say there wasn 't much left of them . A sort of blood and guts soup , with ripped off arms , bits of bone and eyes floating in it . German tripe . I could ... I could see they were Prussian eyes . The look in them . There 's something special about eyes . Ding dong ! Ding dong ! Open the door . Maria ! Open the door , please ! Hello ! It 's your pal at the door . Hello ! Oh , Maria , my angel . My cherub . Wrap your wings round me ... Ask your wife to do that with her wings . And keep your voice down . Your Worship ... - Listen to me , you beautiful child . I 'm not a child . And I 'm not listening . And I 've got a visitor . Who 's in your house ? Eh ? - Ugh , you stinking toad ! Goodnight ! Open the door ! Hey ! Hurry up , open the door ! Open the door ... Listen carefully . If you and I could have a good talk , like two adults , we would be able to save ourselves and everyone else lots and lots and lots of bother and lots of misery on Sunday . We 'll talk about it tomorrow morning . - No ... Maria ! Maria ! Some soldiers ' eyes were burnt away by the mustard gas . Can you imagine ? What 's up ? - I 've got to go . Have you had enough already ? You 've hardly eaten anything . Do you want a drink ? - It 's late . A coffee ? - No , I have to get up early tomorrow . No ! Tony ... help me find him . I 'll leave the money on the bar . You don 't belong here , pal . And leave my woman alone . If it were up to me I 'd be long gone . Everyone 's as mad as a hatter here ! Hey , pal ... - Fuck , man . You will go down on bended knee and apologize to Our Lady and say you should never have come to our village . You can say that again . Fancy it coming to this . Hooligans in Madonna . Didn 't you recognize the boys ? - No , Mother . It was dark . Listen to me , sweetheart , I 'll tell you something . It 's a bad time for decent people like us . That 's enough , that 's enough . Haven 't left yet then ? Do you have the number of a local taxi ? Yes . Can you give it to me ? - No , I 'm on strike . Still . Can I make a phone call from here ? There 's a phone booth by the church . It 's broken . - Right . May I use your shovel ? I don 't have one . - What 's that then ? That 's a spade . May I use your spade , please ? Yes . Thank you . You 're welcome . It 's always a pleasure to help . See , I 'm not contrary . Hello . I may have overdone it a bit yesterday . I can understand that you 're a bit confused . A bit confused , a bit confused ... A day and a half ago my life was absolutely fine . Then , suddenly , I end up in the boondocks . In a hotel with only one room where Madonna is supposed to have stayed . Pig farms everywhere where they 've got everything except ... pigs . Plus a drunk mayor , who 's a vet , who can 't keep his hands off the women . You could call that local color . But being expected to believe in a dead soldier who walks around here whistling , sorry , but that 's just a bit too over the top for me . I 'm not just a bit confused , I think I must have a screw loose . And I 've probably lost my job too . Meanwhile , my fiancee has been waiting in the Ardennes for me for two days . Who calls his girlfriend his fiancee ? Do you know what I want to do ? Make one phone call . Just one call , to my fiancee , to tell her I 'll be late , to say our life together can begin after this and we 'll soon forget this weekend . Watch out for shells . The ditches are full of unexploded ammunition . You 're crazy , pal ! Maria ... Maria ... Maria ... Maria , sorry . Maria , sorry . You don 't understand shit , do you ? Here , in the boondocks , where we crawl around , you may not find a hotspot , but people live here . A little bit of respect wouldn 't go amiss . There 's a cell phone tower on the church spire but it 's switched off . They installed it to get a grant and the mayor , the vet , the womanizer , had it switched off because the radiation is bad for the cows ' milk . We live here with the animals . If you have a very long ladder , you can switch it on . Call your future wife , ask her to come and get you . This evening you 'll be sitting on your father-in-law 's lap playing his banjo . Farewell , Tony Roozen . Hey ! Hey , you scoundrel ! Do you have permission to do that ? That 's church property . Hey ! Hey ! Get down from there , now ! Get down ! What audacity ! - We need the police . Valère ! Where 's Valère ? Didn 't you hear what the mayor said ? Get down from there . - Did you hear that ? What nerve ! Does anyone have a gun ? A gun ? Then I can shoot him down . Calm down , Jean-Pierre . He 'll fall off in a minute . Bea . - Oh , you are still alive ? I 'm not sure . - What ? What aren 't you sure about ? Get down from there immediately . Jean-Pierre , be careful with that gun . What are you doing ? Just come to the Ardennes , because I am really ... Final warning . Get down from there now or I 'll shoot . Please , just come to the Ardennes now . I 'm not asking you twice . I can 't . I can 't get away from here . Come now , or don 't bother coming . Please . I 'm going to shoot . Bea , I ... - Tony ... Take it easy ! Oh , fuck . Take it easy . I 'm coming down , I 'm coming down . Come on , get in there . Go on . Here 's your jacket . It was still on your motor car . It can get cold here at night . You might catch something and get ill and then you 'll die . Nice ring . It was in November , in ' 17 . I just had a few days ' leave . Gusta and I spent three days in each other 's arms . Room 7 . She was pregnant then but I had to go back to the front . To the trenches , in the rain . It was a Monday . It had been quiet all day . Silent . And we were in our trenches ... And everyone knew that something had to happen , it was too quiet . And suddenly , on the dot of nine ... the rats all ran out of their holes at the same time and I went to see and ... it was gas . Floating towards us like morning mist across the fields . The yellow death . The Prussians had bombarded us with mustard gas . And we didn 't have any gas masks , so ... But I was close to the latrines . The hole full of shit and mud and rotting remains . I jumped into the latrine . It was the only way , the only place to flee to . Gusta had given me a hankie embroidered with roses . I just had time to tie it over my mouth and then I jumped in . Until I was desperate for breath and had to come back up . I wanted to take a breath of air but I couldn 't . It was as if boiling acid was being poured down my throat . It burnt . Then I sank back down into the latrine again . And suddenly it was over . I remember thinking , " Bloody hell , is that it ? " In my mind I saw Gusta lying there , with her bulging belly , beautiful . Dammit ! I could look into her belly for a moment . That baby was lying there peacefully . It was a little boy . I thought of Gusta 's eyes . Do you know what the worst thing was ? That I wasn 't able to say goodbye . To say " thanks " ... " take care " and " I love you " . That 's how it goes , pal . SCHOOL DIES = MADONNA DIES REFERENDUM = SWINDLE Dear parishioners , does our Madonna 's plinth really need to be opened ? Should the secrets we have entrusted to Our Holy Mother for years just be revealed to everyone ? No one knows , no one knows , how much weight is lifted off my shoulders knowing that you can tell that statue everything that is bothering you , so that I have my hands free for the real work of a parish shepherd . Dear parishioners ... Thank you . Good boy . We are living in a vulnerable community . And your love and your gentleness should not be disturbed by the aggressive intervention of an outsider . We must be on our guard till the very end . Go on , get out of here . Get out of here . Marcel . - Hi . Right , everyone . Having said this , before we vote , I 'm giving the final word to Maria Glorie , who , in spite of the fact that she calls the referendum a swindle , has still graced us with her dazzling presence . Like every speaker , she will get exactly sixty seconds . Nestor . I 'm not going to repeat myself . The choice is yours . If one more pupil leaves , there 's no longer a legal basis for keeping the school in Madonna open . Our school has been here for two hundred years . I don 't expect you to all start having children ... so I can only hope for new inhabitants . But I also want to fight to protect the battlefields . Do we still remember how many people died to protect this piece of ground ? Between 8 and 10 million . Many of whom are still missing . Your fathers , grandfathers and great-grandfathers are under our feet . You can hear them , crawling around , breathing , looking for a way out . It is our duty to them to ensure that there is still a school in Madonna , and that tons of concrete aren 't poured on their grave . So I think the widening of the old road is a good thing . And the crossroads being relaid ... I agree , Your Worship , it is absurd . But what is the problem ? - 60 seconds , stop . Are you so scared of the plinth being removed from the statue of Madonna ? Who here has something to hide ? Hey , 60 seconds is 60 seconds ! We 're going to vote . Come on , let 's start . Mr Van Theun , priest . Mr Huysseune , mayor . Marcel Goegebeure . Germaine ... Paul Nachtegaele . Berta Nachtegaele . Melanie Verbrugge . Maria Glorie . A SOLDIER 'S RIPPED-OFF ARM Well I 'll be damned ... Thirty-six . Thirty-seven . Thirty-eight . Thirty-nine . Forty . Are we ready , pal ? Let 's see . Right , thanks , Nestor . Attention . Your attention , please . Dear inhabitants of Madonna , democracy has spoken this evening . Forty valid voting papers have been counted . Here is the result . Against the widening of the old road and therefore the unnecessary conversion of the crossroads into a roundabout : 34 votes . For : 5 votes . Blank : 1 vote . The proposal is therefore rejected . Everything stays as it was . Right . Right , right . That means we won 't agree to Brussels ' request but will submit a proposal to lay a new main road to Madonna . Well done ! - Jerk . What 's the matter , Gusta ? Tony ... Look at you . Where have you been all this time ? Eh ? Berta ? - What , Pol ? That 's your handwriting . May 1974 . Dear Mary , Mother of God ... Dear Madonna , Sometimes I want to strangle my wife ... I 've come to confess to you . I 'm carrying Pol Nachtegaele 's child but I don 't love the man . Dear Madonna , I am crazy about the village school teacher . I 've had enough of my wife ... I imagine myself at her funeral and I feel happy . What do I do ? Roland Vanwachtebeke . I don 't know how much longer I can put up with her . The mayor . Is room 7 still free ? No . I 'm sleeping there tonight . But you can join me . Pol , look . Look . Oh , Pol ... My good mate Roger De Bakker , who was in the trenches with me in ' 16 , he told me . He said that , after Ostend , Dinant is the most beautiful town in the world . He knew all about it because he rode a motorcycle . So I suggest that we go to Dinant first and maybe get a discount on our honeymoon . And then , if we get that far , there is a waterfall at Coo , apparently . At least 15 meters high , right out in the country ... We can have a nice photo taken there . Eh ? What do you reckon ?

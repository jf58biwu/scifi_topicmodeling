Sieg Heil , Mondjugendunterführerin Renate Richter ! Heil Hitler ! Boys and girls , please sit down . Dieter , don 't you know where to put your behind ? Fräulein Richter : Since the Mondführer 's 65th birthday the appropriate salute has been : " Heil Kortzfleisch " ! You 're such an exemplary boy . Today , we 'll start with the most unpatriotic language . It 's the language we need to know when we return to those ... who need our help . In English now . Where are we from ? - Siegfried . - The earth . And , when did we leave ? - Brunhilde . - 1945 . - And where did we go ? - The dark side of the moon . Brilliant ! Attention ! The National Hymn . Heil Hitler ! - Hitler ? [ coughs ] - What is that , Mr. Adler ? - A spy from the Earth . I captured him myself . He seems to be the leader of the shock troops . Mr. Adler , is this a joke ? I 'll be damned ! Don 't try to play dumb with me . It was your bright idea to send those idiots to the moon . - Talk about disaster . - Not to be the contrarian , Madam President but i 'm pretty sure it was your idea It was my great idea had they succeeded , now it 's your stupid idea . Got it ? I didn 't hire you for stupid ideas I hired you because of your Midas ' touch . Now my polls are in the toilet and the election is just weeks away . You dropped the ball , Vivian ! You ! Now , I need a miracle . Get me a miracle ! Actually , how was sending those two astronauts to the moon supposed to get me reelected , exactly ? We haven 't been to the moon for 50 years . One of them was black . - Thought it would look good . - Look good how ? Like I said , one of them was black . Just think of the opportunity we wasted years ago with that errand boy , Powell , Alan Powell ? - Colin Powell . - That was close . - And where are you going ? - The UN , to do my job " The Great Dictator " by Charlie Chaplin . It is one of the world 's most famous short films . which illustrates in just ten minutes his wish that one day , the entire world will be held in the great Führer 's wise and gentle hands . - Any questions ? - I have a question . My heart . In my classroom we adhere to a strictly formal manner of addressing one another . To what do we owe the honor of this visit ? - We capture an earthling . - Your expertise is required . - What 's for lunch today ? - Sauerkraut . Again ! Please say that 's not true . Hey , sauerkraut . I love sauerkraut . And Volkswagen . Huh ... Fahrvergnügen . Hey ! German words , right ? You know , it 's as if , where I come from we speak German too . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? Damn ! You gonna be sorry you did that white boy . Capture him ! No ! Capture him ! Don 't shoot ! The fugitive is a male negro , unarmed , but possibly angry . What does he look like ? Where does he come from ? What is he wearing ? How do I look ? Like they say in English- - You are a knock-out . How do I get out of here ? Thanks lady . Have a nice day . No , Mr. subhuman . That is the air lock ... No ! You might wanna ... cover up a bit . All good ? Klaus ! Don 't shoot . We need him for tests- - I know a lot of important people . I even know the President of the United States of America . If you kill me , then that 's just a really fucked-up situation . You know the president of the United States of the Americas ? - Take him to Dr. Richter 's laboratory . - By your command ! Thanks , homie . I talk to you later baby . Question , what is this apparatus ? Look man , how would I know ? I 'm just model . - A model of what ? Citizen ? - No man , a model model Damn , what 's wrong with you two ? Are you blind or something ? Shit , I 'm pretty . Are you part of the shock troops before the invasion ? Invasion ? Man , you all must be tripping What is your mission ? Look dude , I just follow the paycheck , you know what I 'm saying ? - What is this device ? - Oh , that 's my kick-ass cellphone - and a computer . - What ? That is not a computer . This is a computer . No , " dat 's " ancient history , homie . Dumb negro . - He talks nonsense . - It might be a dialect . - Probable reason is the skin colour . - Right . His brain structure is different from us Aryans . Let 's open up his skull and measure the brain . No . I need to know why he 's here . You have 24 hours , Doctor . Otherwise I have to rely on an ancient , infallible technique . Pain . I am telling you once again ... One moment we received conformation that the ship has landed successfully on the moon . The next , all communication stopped . - As though it had simply vanished . - Or you 're hiding something from us ? Yeah , we are hiding something on the dark side of the moon . I still find it very difficult to believe that the entire purpose of the mission to promote your president 's reelection . Well , believe what you like , we 've had mere senators spend hundreds of millions on campaigns to get elected to dog-shit posts . But Mr Secretary , the expenses involved this time only makes sense if there was a military purpose . Okay , let 's get this clear . The United States has no military activity on the moon What about natural resources activity ? We know how the US sometimes mixes the two up . Is there any chance that you are looking for Helium-3 up there ? Helium-3 ? You just made that up , didn 't you ? That 's so silly . I assume these are just preliminary ideas ? Sir , we had a very small delivery window . - Sir ? - Yes , sir . Ma 'am , and this is all . Anyone who is not a head of a department , should leave . You idiots ! You morons ! That 's an insult to morons . What is this shit ? I have a meeting with the President of the United fucking States of America tomorrow fucking morning ! Not the President of fucking Zambia . Not the President of the fucking Janitor 's Union ! But the president of the fucking country which you just happen to be living in for the fucking moment . You pieces of hellacious shit ! What am I suppose to tell her ? That my employees are not intelligent enough to be fucking morons ? - Mr. Adler . - Call me Klaus please ! May I come in ? Of course . I 've come to discuss our legal union . - Is that a marriage proposal ? - There 's no need for marriage . I received confirmation from the Department of Racial Purity . - Our genetic match is 97 percent . - How romantic . Science demands us to unite physically . It 's our destiny to produce perfect offspring for the people . What about my scientific research ? One day , Renate ... All this will be ours . But first , I must conquer the Earth . Wolfgang , the old fart , stands in my way ... In the way of final victory . The two of us will take on an enormous responsibility . Your place is by my side . Gentlemen ! Battleship Götterdämmerung . Our miracle weapon that has been under development for 40 years . The dream of our beloved Führers . But unfortunately only a dream , until now . - Please , Doctor . - Watch this ! This tiny device has over a thousand times more computing power than our biggest computers together . I engineered this cable to connect this machine with our main computer . I call this the Universal Systematic Binding : USB for short . This will lift it into the air . Finally , The Götterdämmerung will fly ! Yes ! You saw it ! You saw it with your own eyes ! Mein Führer , please let me return to the Earth , let me get more of these devices . - No one has ever returned . I will return . We don 't have a choice if we want to prevent an invasion from the Earth . Are you willing to work with the Führer ... in the name of the Fatherland , stand behind the Wehrmacht . This decision does not resolve all of us ... Thank you . I thought my ears were gonna bleed . You 're welcome . May I ask what your name is ? James Washington . - What yours ? - Renate Richter . It is a pleasure to meet you , Washington . James Washington . What 's wrong with your skin ? Come on now please , you have met a brother before , right ? - No , I 'm an only child . - No , no . I didn 't mean like that . I meant a black man . No , and this continues to confuse me because you are much blacker than when I first encountered you . Okay girl , look either I 'm black or you 're blind . Look , what is going to happen to me ? I mean , what with this guy keep sticking needles in me ? - What about that other angry dude ? - My father sticking needles into you ? That freaking scientist guy ? That your dad ? And what about , you know ... Mr. Nachrichtenübermittlungs-Oberführer Adler ? - I 'm sorry , what ? - Klaus Adler . He 's going to be the next führer . And my husband . Why , did you lose a bet or something ? I mean ... Lucky you . Actually , lucky him . - I shouldn 't even be here . - You cannot leave me tied up like this . - Please do me a favor . - What ? - Play a Nazi . - And if I don 't ? - They will eliminate you . - Oh , great ! Is there a different radio station ? With the upcoming war ... Looks good . This will solve our little problem . Okay , Baby Mengele . Hey man , I don 't like the look of this . I 'm coming . Looks very good ! And now we just ... - Why don 't you take me with you ? - Don 't worry , darling . After I 've completed my mission , I 'll come back to you . That 's not what I mean I 'm an Earthologist ! I know everything about it . You need me . You sweet little thing , where do you get all those crazy ideas ? Books , mostly ... and some films . I shall return triumphant ! - Heil Hitler ! - Heil Kortzfleisch ! - Get it through your skull . - Of course , mein Führer . We have one more ace up our sleeve . Show him what we have . Little snowflake , little white coat ... Voilá , gentlemen ! - Doctor . - Now watch closely gentlemen . Heil ! Stand up , you fool . Sieg Heil ! With the prisoner now being one of us , we go down to earth . He will help us to find more telephone computers , return , and then get Götterdämmerung flying . Oberführer Adler , I hope you 've discussed my return to the Earth . Something along those lines . The Reich trusts you . Thank you Doctor . Take care of your daughter for me . Sieg Heil ! See you in Valhalla . - Can you smell that ? - No . We don 't have time to waste . Take me to that president of yours . What ? The President ? Come on man , I thought you want me to take you to Mac store or something . You said that you know the President of these United States of the Americas . Right , of course . That President . May I meet this President too ? Renate ! What are you doing here ? Hey , Mrs. Richter , welcome to my planet . This is not the place for the mother of the children of the future Führer ... and definitely not the place for a woman ! My place is by my man . - Get the hell out of my property - We got to get out of here A Volkswagen van . Hold on there , Boss man . That may not be the sharpest move . Let me go talk to those guys . They know me , I 'm one of them . Are you with me ? Now you 're talking . Now . - Doesn 't he know ? - No . He 'll be thrilled . I am happy to see you all , man . Thank you . You all know me . - Washington . - I mean ... That ain 't one of y 'all 's , is it ? Because I ... you ain 't have to bring that shit out . I 'm a peace loving brother . - Are you alright ? - Do I fucking look alright to you Mrs. crazy fucking Nazi ? What the hell just happen ? You know .. No , mother-f way ! What did you sick sons-of-bitches do to me ? - I should 've told you . - What ? That I look like a fucking polar bear ? You two really , really , know how to fuck up a guy 's Christmas . Quiet you fool. what is wrong with you ? We made you Aryan , you 're one of us now . - You should be thanking us . - Thanking you ? What I should have done is let those brothers come here with a size 15 put those foot so far up your ass to can taste the toe nails for two fucking weeks . Klaus . Bring me to your leader , James Washington . Hey , what the fuck ? Excuse me . Get your fucking hands off me , you mother ... - You can use her to you boss ? - Yes , she 's the cheese . - And she knows the president ? - Yes , they are really tight . Come on . Dirty bastards . Do you know who I am ? huh ? You just kidnapped the wrong woman . The wrong fucking woman . I hope your having a good time . I 'm gonna kick your fucking ass . Excellent . My turn . I am Commander Klaus Adler of the 4th Reich . We are based on the moon . I 'm told you know the President of these United States of the Americas . You will take us to that , the President , because ... - I have a very special present for him - Him ? Well , he 'll love that . He just loves presents . As soon as my mission is accomplished the Nazi invasion force will be called in under my directions and we will end the good times for the bad people . And how do you propose to do that ? - We 'll simply eliminate them . - What ? - Sorry , that is not what we are told - Renate , I do not think that you ... Yeah . Why not ? Why don 't you tell this fraulein why we are here , just like you keep telling your children . I would love to do that . You see ... the National Socialist Party is the people 's party , nothing more ... We wish to return to Earth with our message of peace and unity love through virtue and kindness , for example . We are healthy , in mind and body . Our spirits are brave and true . We achieved because we are strong , disciplined in our core . There is simply no belief that they can match ours ... because peace and unity is the gift we bring to all mankind . What you and all earthlings need to know ... - Yeah yeah , I get it , Hedvig . This is good . This is going to work . You , I need . And you ... I want . Alright , let 's go meet the President . Madam President ... here 's the miracle you asked for . - Who is this man ? - He will lead the campaign troops . Renate , please ... This is very simple . The world is sick ... and we are the doctors . The world is anemic and we are the vitamin . The world is weary , but we are the strength . We are here to make the world healthy once again . With hard work ... with honesty , with clarity , with decency . We are the product of loving mothers and brave fathers . We are the embodiment of love and bravery . We are the gift of both God and science . We are the answer to the question . We are the promise delivered to all mankind . For that we raise our hand , to one nation . We step to the beat of one drum ... of this world . We are the people that carry the children on our shoulders . In the same way that our fathers carried us and their fathers before them . We are the one people united and strong . We are the one people with certainty . We are invincible and we have no fear . Because the truth makes us one . The moon Nazis are coming . What 's wrong with you people , can 't you see ? Look , I 've been there . I 'm telling you .

Is that correct ? - Yes , that 's correct . - So I was listening . And you are Neil Armstrong after the sex change operation . Is this correct ? No , that is not correct You were not listening at all . My name is Richter . Renate Richter . I tried to save this man 's life and I think he 's stupid , childish and ungrateful . Ask Mrs. Moon-Nazi here , was I , or was I not on the dark side of the moon ? Yes , Mr. James Washington was on the dark side of the moon . There , what did I tell you ? I am black , but now I 'm white . I went to the dark side of the moon , but I 'm now back . The Nazis are coming to kill us all ! And you are going to be so sorry that you didn 't listen to me . Mr. Washington , James . Why are you so upset and so angry ? - Get lost . - But I do not understand . I mean , We made you white . We taught you the National Socialist message about peace and unity . You people have robbed me of everything . My race , my identity , my career . And I 'm beginning to think my flipping mind too . I mean just everything . Do you know this ? Yes . Come on . Come on in . I will explain it to you . Then you 'll understand it . You are one strange broad . I will give you that . Oh , and you know you 'll be buying popcorn . What bullshit ! It was ... - It was so long . - Yeah , they could 've edited it down a bit . He was mocking the Führer ! I 'm getting a sense it 's a lot about Nazis you don 't know . - But I am a Nazi ! - Yeah , I know but you 're not like ... Well , like them . A bunch of stupid bullies .

Good evening , boys . What have we got here , blond hair , blue eyes , nice rack ? Even Hitler will get a hard-on ! - Look guys , we don 't want any trouble - Get lost , hobo ! - I gotta plenty stories to tell , you 're not gonna believe ... - Stop that , that is enough ! What she needs is a good war . A war always makes a president popular . Well , I might be able to help her out there . How do you mean ? One word from me , and the invasion from the moon begins . - You never break character do you ? - No . I can never be broken . - You smell so good . - The time has come . I show you my plans . Come back here . Look I 've outlined some things ... Oh big fella , all work and no play ? Now listen , don 't you think if I asphyxiate the president ... Will the troops then align with us ? That 's when I will order the moon invasion . It will be quietless bloodshed . other then eliminating the moon führer of course . Klaus Adler . Heil Hitler ! The name 's not Hitler ! So Klaus , is the clown joining us ? What , did you all buy tickets ? Okay , so , do you want to introduce me to your friends ? Get your hooks off me you Kristallnacht piece-of-shit I can make this worth your while . Just let me go . Do it , Moon Corporal . And you want to eliminate the Mondführer ? Do you know the penalty for high treason ? This is flagship Tannhäuser speaking . We 've reached the orbit and we 're ready for the Valkyries to start . Battleship Heinrich ready for attack .

We 'll wipe all these sub-humans off the face of the Earth . Klaus ! I 'm here to tell you that I have nothing to do with you or your plans You Nazi-piece-of-shit ! Oh well , a blessing in disguise . Now I can kill all the enemies of the Reich in one stroke . Farewell , Puppet Führer . He fell for the old " one-last-blowjob " offer . God , nazis are stupid . I commend you on your marksmanship .

I 'm getting the hell out of here ! We have little information , but here 's what we know at this time ... - Ok . You see , the thing is , that Klaus , he 's ... - I know this was your doing . - It 's wonderful . - It 's wonderful ? It 's brilliant ! I 'm a wartime president now . All presidents who start a war in their first term always get reelected . I thought I was gonna have to bomb Australia or something . But no . You bring me real ... - Who are these guys anyway ? - Nazis . - From the moon . - Real life Nazis ? Holy shit , this just keeps getting better and better . You 're a miracle worker , babe . They are the only guys we ever actually managed to beat in a fair fight . I 'm just like Franklin D. Roosevelt . Only , you know I 'm not a spastic . I knew you 'd be excited . So , if you 're our Roosevelt , then who 's your General Patton or you know , MacArthur ? Mr Secretary of Defense , do you have any thoughts on this ? Send her . - Me ? - Hey , you 're the miracle worker . Apparently you dodge bullets too - I wouldn 't know ... - What to wear ? You 'll think of something - You always do . - Madam President , ready to face the music ? It 's the space Nazis ! Take us upstate . We need to go back to the Moon . We ? No , no , no ! See ? We rhymes with me . And I ain 't going . - You don 't get it ! They have the Götterdämmerung on the Moon . - I couldn 't give a good goddamn what they have up there . - I 'm not going back to that place . No way ! - You want to look like that for the rest of your life ? Oh great , now this is my fault . - Let me in . Let me in . - I 'm no hero , James . I need you . Do you know how to drive this thing ? Well . Can 't be any different than playing ' Wing Commander Let 's try .. I swear we do not have nothing on the Moon - Japan ? - It is not ours . - China ? - It is not us . It 's bloody well not ours - I confess ! - Yes , North Korea ? Confess to what ? The spaceships are ours . Our beloved leader designed and built them himself - What is so funny ? - All right , North Korea . Sit down . - So , it was you India , I knew that ! - No , no , no ! That is a sign of peace ! - This is a sign of peace ! This is a sign of peace ! - Just cut it out , you morons ! These thugs are Nazis and I mean the real McCoy . They have been hiding on the moon just waiting to pounce . Now my question is , what are y 'all planning to about it ? 'Cause we just happen to have a little something up our own sleeve . And I 'm sure that you 'll be thankful for it . May I present you with the Mars exploration ship , The USS George W. Bush . Good work , take it to Officer Tyler , please . This is trajectory , what 's our status on the orbit window ? Commander on deck ! The hostile fleet have launched a full scale aerial attack against the United States . These Zeppelins appear to be carriers and they are operating fully within the thermosphere . Each of them carry approximately 200 enemy vessels and are extremely ... Hell hath no fury , Mr. Adler . Alright kiddies , let 's get this show on the road . Vivian , you look great . How is it going up there ? Madam President , I couldn 't be better . I am packing dozen of mega tonnes of nuclear warheads which I am going to carefully place up Klaus 's Kraut ass - just as soon as I get him in my sights . - Carry on . Kick butt ! Let them see what that baby can do ! ... working at optimum capacity . Ammo consumption within tolerance . We 're coming under extremely heavy fire . We gonna need the reinforcements right now . What the hell is the meaning of this ? Good day mates . This is Australian ship , Dundee 01 . Ready to kick ass . Spitfire reporting in . Hang in there W , Canada joining the battle . It 's a direct violation of international space treaty that you all signed , every single one of you ! MIR joining the battle . That is supposed to be destroyed ! This is an outrage , you 're all liars , just like my ex-ex-husband . - Come down lady , come down . - Don 't you lady me , Pinko ! Okay who didn 't arm their spaceships ? Oh , great , great . That is just great ! - You all gave me your word ! - But you broke yours ! We always break ours , that 's just what we do . Okay , fine , fine , fine ! Let 's just beat the shit out of these pricks and talk about the details later . Heroes of the First Fleet , continue your attack to the last man- - and remember , you 're fighting for the Reich ! Where the hell did they come from ? Prepare an appropriate uniform for the Führer . The Fatherland is calling its children ! This device will complete the biggest war machine of all time . The Götterdämmerung will fly - Heil Adler ! This is beautiful . - Where the hell are we going ? - To the Götterdämmerung . I think Klaus will be there . What did you think of that , Herr Adler ? Alright , what about this moon business ? What do you say we head on over and slap them around a bit ? Klaus , baby I coming to get ya ' . Attention ! Heil Adler ! Heil . As you were . Well ? The Earth fleet will be within firing range in 20 minutes . - Are your troops ready ? - We 're waiting for Dr. Richter . - What the hell is this place ? - This is the Götterdämmerung . It will liberate the earth . Actually , it 's the biggest war machine ever created by man . - This is the bridge . That 's where I 'm going . - I need to find your father , so ... - Where do you think he at ? - I think you will find him over there Try to sneak in , and please , paralyze the engines . Or otherwise the earth is destroyed . - Note to self , paralyze the engine . Got it . Oh ! No , no no . You be careful - I mean , you know ... - What ? - Because you like me . - Right ... Oh , come on , a little . I mean ... You like me ... We have a visual on the Nazi fortress , commander . Obvious and overstated as usual , Klaus . Alright , everyone , let 's get those nukes in action . - I 'm declaring this fortress a free-fire-zone . - But Commander , there are women and children down there . The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists . - Prime warheads on secondary armament . - Roger that . - Prepare all available ordinance for ground bombardment . - Fire the fucking nukes ! Nukes away . Job well done . Out of the way ! Who dares disturb me ? Who dares disturb me ? - Doctor Richter ! How much time do you need ? - The Götterdämmerung will fly . It will be ready for the final victory . Cut the crap . How long ? Let 's say three months , give or take a little . You have three minutes . He cut me off . It 's not that easy . Russia wasn 't conquered in a day- - Hey quack : remember me ? The Moon spook you turned into a snowflake . Start the Helium-3 engines . Now ! Start the engines . Oh shit , it 's alive . He must have the smallest dick in the universe . Load the cannons . Time ... to fuck back . Everyone , take positions around this fat phallus and wait for my command to open fire . - Offensive run confirmed . - Let her rip . Shit ! - Are the cannons ready to fire ? - Yes my Führer . But the Earth is below the horizon , on the other side of the Moon . We can 't shoot . Full moon was yesterday . Let 's make a brand new horizon . Fire at will . Reactivate the systems , Weapons NCO . We 'll see- - NATIONAL HYMN For motivation , break glass It 's no time to sing now ! It 's a false alarm ! Are you all imbeciles ? Go and see what 's going on ! On the double ! Renate ... - I won 't let you do it . What will you do ? Shoot me ? Good girl ... Renate Richter , my bride-to-be . You destroyed something beautiful , something wonderful . A future world full of Aryan children . Our Aryan children ! But you betrayed me , and for that , you shall pay . Your beauty shall adorn Odin 's table . Klaus ! Wait ! Let me do something . - Now ? I 'm a bit busy . - I 've always respected you . As Führer , and as a man . I 've even loved you . I belong to you . To you . Cute little speech . But it 's too late , my dear . Good bye . I understand . I hail you . My Klaus . Sieg Heil , my Führer ! - Washington , do you hear me ? Washington ? - Renate , was that you ? - You need to shut down the engine . - I 'm working on it . Shit ... Congratulations . High five . Well , that was disappointing . Do you think he suffered ? Even just a little ? Vivian , I knew you could do it . You 're foxy and salacious , all the way . Congratulations . - What 's Helium-3 ? - Helium . Did you say Helium-3 ? Yes , there is like about 15 to 20 giant towers that appear to be full of this stuff . - That 's ours . - It is ? Why ? Helium-3 would make the U.S. independent of all energy needs for the next thousand years . Yes , it 's ours . No , no , no . Hear me out . Hear me out . The moon is American soil . Moon flag , Stars and Stripes . Who beat the Moon Nazis ? We did . Well , yeah yeah , alright , you helped out here and there , but ultimately it 's just like World War II ... and who won that ? We did - You lie . - You don 't believe me ? Watch the movies . Movies don 't lie . Not the shoe , Jesus . Vivian , this is the Secretary of Defense . - Defend and hold that Helium-3 at all costs . - But against who ? Against everybody ! No . Please don 't , never again ! Please stop . What was the Earth like ? Different . When can we go there ? Soon . Soon . But how ? - In peace . Unfortunately that 's the story of revenge . It 's messy . Never really works out the way you wanted to . I feel lonely . The eternal love of God , the love of God into our hearts , or we will burn ... burn in hell , burning in eternal damnation . Renate . Washington . You 're alive ! You are alive ! It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . And you are the way you 're meant to be . Are you aware that you are kissing a black man ? I guess we have a lot of work cut out for us .

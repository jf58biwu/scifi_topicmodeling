Sir , nothing on the slq-32 . Zero electronic emissions . They 're most likely radio silent . Maybe . But they 're close . How do you know ? Because if they have the c.O. , they 're gonna call , Try to make a trade - - Tex and the c.O. For dr . Scott and her work . Rachel : So what you can see here Is the virus attaching to receptors In a healthy human cell . Once attached , it invades And completely destroys its host Before moving on to the next cell . This is what happens To everyone in the world who contracts the virus . And death comes quickly ... As you have seen . Yes . [ mouse clicks ] now , here , once again , The virus is on the attack , but this time , The receptors to which it attaches are free-floating , Not part of a healthy cell . So it simply flushes out the system Without causing any infection . And that ... Is you , bertrise . Those are your receptors , Which I have injected into our primate friend over there . And if it can fool the virus inside him ... You 'll have a vaccine ? [ distant beeping ] I was always so sick as a kid . Everyone used to tease me that I was pretending So I wouldn 't have to go to school . And now here I am . Immune to the most deadly virus in the world And possibly its savior .

Do more testing , but ... Yes . Which means ruskov doesn 't need me anymore . You can send him a dose in exchange For tex and the captain . Ruskov won 't just take your word for it . He 'll want to make sure . Well , then I 'll show him myself . I 'm no longer essential on this ship . From here on in , it 's merely a case of Mass-producing the vaccine from my original formula . But , doctor - - I can show doc rios everything he needs to know . And if extra help is required , I 'm sure you can Strike a bargain with quincy . I can 't let you go . Ruskov asked for me . And I won 't do a thing for him Until he releases tex and the captain . Danny : Ma 'am , you don 't realize what you 're signing up for .

Like I said before , you 're part of my team . You ready to bring it ? Hell , yeah , sir . [ pats back ] let 's map this out . This is a .45 caliber pistol . Excellent knock-down power , but the trade-off Is that it 's large and heavy . It 's a got an 8-round magazine , loaded . And I 'm gonna give you an extra . Let 's hope you won 't need it . And lastly , the suppressor . It 's highly effective . Without it , you 'll wake up the entire ship . But you need time to attach it . Are we clear ? Crystal . Outstanding . Thank you . If anything should happen ... Finish what we started . [ door opens ] The russians are picking you up in one of their helos Out in the middle of nowhere , taking you to their ship .

Now I understand Why the good doctor agreed to pay us a visit . [ speaks russian ] [ grunts ] [ door opens ] the deal was me for them . You gave your word that you 'd let them go . Not until I confirm That you 've delivered what I 've requested . Well , I assume you have a lab . [ equipment beeping ] ah . Dr. Scott . Ah . So nice to see you again . Do I know you ? European congress of virology , 2011 . Uh , you spoke on techniques for hemagglutination-inhibition With arthropod-borne viruses . And afterwards , I introduced myself , shook hands . Niels sorensen . I 'm sorry . I don 't recall . I was with professor lindblom . I remember jonas . You were in his department ? Um ... For a time . Uh , he ... Never really saw clearly What I was trying to , uh ... Anyways ... I 'd invite you in , but it 's such a mess . [ laughs ] Uh , actually , they are , uh , supposed to clean up every day . And I tell them that the u.V. Light kills the virus , But , um ... [ laughs ] You 're infected . Uh , not exactly . But you 're not even symptomatic . Um ... Perhaps I should explain . It was you . You added the human gene . Yes . You weaponized the virus ! What ? No . No , I didn 't weaponize it . I was really close to a major breakthrough . I added my gene to the virus And then injected it back into my bloodstream , And it worked . I am completely immune . I just - - Uh , I didn 't know that I also made myself a carrier . So you 're patient zero ? No , I didn 't start it . I 'm trying to find a solution here . I 'm trying to fix it , and I can fix it As soon as I get the primordial strain . If that - - you don 't understand what you 've done . The primordial won 't work now . The virus that you created , The modifications you made - - you 've made it so much worse . And you could have come forward at any point . I mean , you must have known this . No , that was too late . There was zero benefit from me coming forward at that point - - You killed four billion people . I didn 't - - and you never gave them a chance To understand how it happened ? But I can now . I mean , can solve it now . It 's too late . I 've already done it . [ scoffs ] I already made the vaccine . That 's a lie ! See for yourself . Hey , that - - no . You 're not allowed to do that , actually . That 's mine ! That 's mine ! I would like to speak with the admiral , please . No ! She doesn 't go anywhere ! Unh ! You don 't get to do it without me . Did you really think That your d.N.A. Could save the human race ? Dr. Scott ... [ door closes ] [ handcuffs click ] [ clattering ] Unbelievable . I mean , I can 't believe she kissed you . You 're a married man , for pete 's sake . And you 're navy . Did you not get the talk ? No fraternization with the ladies , buddy . [ breathes sharply ] [ lowered voice ] " ladder room . Port side , 0400 . " [ lowered voice ] you know where that is ? I have an idea . First we gotta get by this guy . And there 's two guards on the p-way . Goddamn it . He had to send her . Right ? I mean , I 'm standing right there . She could have easily passed me the note . Tex ... 0400 . Got it . You lied to me ! I took you in because you told me She was not capable of succeeding without you . Now I find you 've wasted my time and resources . Do you really think I 've kept myself in here for nothing ? I 'm telling you , admiral , her vaccine won 't work . You still need me . That 's right . I do . Ruskov : Dr. Scott . [ russian continues ] [ speaks russian ] [ continues speaking russian ] shh . [ inhales sharply ] [ exhales ] now we test the vaccine . [ door zips ] [ shouting in russian ] What are you waiting for ? Do it . [ panting ] Aah ! [ shouting in russian ] [ muttering ] Aah ! [ exhales ] [ motor revving ] Man : Whiskey frog , 1 back 9 . Whiskey frog , 1 back 9 . Standing by . Outstanding . Let 's hope she got him that note . [ speaking russian , laughing ] Comfortable ? As I boy , I shared a room not much larger than this With my five brothers and sisters . My parents were not among the political elite . We grew familiar with tight quarters , With cold , with hunger . Oh , that 's a real sob story . Well told . Aren 't they expecting you back in transylvania Before sunrise ? [ chuckles ] This vaccine your dr . Scott has developed Is now the single greatest commodity in the world . Every day its value increases , As those not yet infected grow desperate for it . And it 's mine ! [ laughs ] The american dream . Isn 't that the expression ? Think it got lost in the translation . Once I have successfully tested the vaccine , I will most likely kill all of you and destroy your ship . But ... Perhaps there 's another way - - A way that can help your shipmates , your friends , Your families . You have courage , first-rate ship , A crew that will follow you wherever you say . I think we can work well together . Achieve a great deal together . My name is thomas chandler , Commander , United States navy , Serial number 4242022634 . Tex : Was a good talk , boris . If there 's nothing else ... [ inhales ] Well , we 'd like to get some shut-eye . 10 minutes , sir . Master chief , how you feeling ? Scared to death , sir . Well , you 're not alone , I 'm sure . No , sir . I am not . Yeah . [ sighs ] [ radio chirps ] This is your x.O. So ... Two sailors walk into a bar . And they both walk out . We will get our men back . We will get our captain back .

I don 't wish to ruin the ending for you , But your vaccine will not work . Isn 't that right , dmitri ? You 're not feeling so good , huh ? The virus already has you in its clutches . [ breathing heavily ] [ footsteps approaching ] The cavalry has arrived . You okay , sir ? I 'm fine . This your idea , burk ? Can 't take all the credit , but I 'm happy to be here , sir . Yeah . We 'll talk about this later . Where 's dr . Scott ? The lab should be one level down , back aft . We 'll pick her up on the way to the extract point , Off the flight deck . Let 's move .

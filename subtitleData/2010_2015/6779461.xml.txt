 the moon watching they 're everywhere Dave people from the moon are here tonight big program started next well you know what this sounds really to me like you 're describing the Roswell incident ok so we went to the moon because we 're looking for civilization something what did you say sir what wait sir are you still there George thought it was a hoax until the photo album showed up and when he won the photo i 'm actually showed up that 's when he called us and got us to look at it and there were some really really bizarre photos in this photo album by the one picture that really stood out there was was a Polaroid not just because of what was in the Polaroid because the guy that was in the pole right the subject are managed so weird very weird looking individual unlike anybody I 've ever seen this guy was in modern dress he was bald he had a blank bacon expression on the space something in very weird-looking guy but the thing is it was a very old book aerial picture but he 's in modern-day close the whole situation seems like present day but it was really really old and that didn 't make any sense especially since she can 't fake a Polaroid picture as we 're investigating this Polaroid we discovered on the back of its numbers and as we research what the numbers were finally realized that they were GPS coordinates just so happens that we 're near where those GPS for the point right here for 40 miles away we live we live according to less than 40 miles away from where the GPS coordinates actually directed us to those so I mean how could we not come out here and see right now what we 're gonna find in you know but who knows what 's down there we 're gonna find out yeah we 're braving it were tough in the dark following the coordinates was the first of many dates the average they had received was highly questionable it contained area for the grass as the Louisiana river that area from $ MONTH 1898 the wright brothers first flight was not and 19 or 35 years later this needed to be explained okay we 're out of the location right now but we have a problem the waters to be higher than it was last night option number back next week it 's not going to fall that fast it 's rigo looks word Lord we 're going to try and actually gain access to it not from the hat but we 're just gonna pull up a couple of board little access to excellent yeah yeah this last board right here and we can fit in this thing try to do this do it me seriously go down yeah yeah yeah that 's what we came here we 're here this purpose we got ya know I 'm gonna be we got a job scatting scatting we just can 't flash light sticks yeah actually they 're still in every little thing I touched i think is about there is a ladder but like i said it 's down it 's not right on the top step down yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what the hell are they doing down here with all those issues no idea yes nail ok yeah alright would make sure i don 't know how many closest yeah please leave them in and why are we doing keep asking because why not just fell in our laps you know we didn 't know what to make of it and it 's compelling and relative i wanna know something is going on out there under our faces that were not paying attention to can 't see and I don 't know anything right we don 't have anything but this picture and numbers and so crazy little story titled is it is foolish to pursue any clue that may lead to a hidden truth our solution in the barracks right I suppose nothing could happen kind of this but something very welcome right so we 're here we 're going to catch the does ok we met yeah open it sure magnetically media it Phil it 's an elevator gold and maybe if we close the door and turn it on shit Sonny section still there yeah he 's in there all right yeah yeah where did he go it went further down fuck further down we 're not going further have no there 's no up further down yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hey I found a switch series yeah we 're right here yeah fuck yeah go for all right yeah will it up something happened yeah over there yeah instead I itself yeah some can make contraption something that 's kind of like a bomb don 't touch it alright and that 's all i needed to get too attached and what was nothing there so what is it I 'd say it 's a product yeah yeah I say we take this thing we go I 'm tellin ya thats yes this is but this is not cool it 's the only thing here is that you were taken with its gotta be important thing here exactly you don 't carry that you want that we see what space yeah i 'll carry back and we gotta go can you pick it up can you even pick that up try oh yeah you look yeah yeah we take it right out a costume not without this well you carry yes I don 't come on yeah yeah yeah yeah that 's right we 're gonna go yeah the other yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah my hands were shaking so bad yeah and I was even I was faced the other way what the hell are painted doing down in the freaking in a warehouse underwater this was an emergency eggs this was not I mean that one didn 't get all that shit through that yeah you 're right that wasn 't them that 's an emergency exit that must mean there be blood stain out constantly too cold alright cameras and a book and since yeah work instead filming that 's really just for yeah Wow one destruction here what this is I promise you I 'll tell you it 's for that right there I mean look at the picture some point it was like something that looked like that piece of that and a series of procedures for power and polaroid cameras and the numbers in the photo album were on the old Polaroid I don 't know if this is what this just seems to be how to turn on so I say we give it a shot yeah buddy yeah do ok that machine looks like we can hit the switch but I but there 's no power supply so I really don 't think oh dude what happened fuck is that I have no idea i wasn 't it mostly in the second one just be ready already been the first way yeah I . yeah the other yeah yeah yeah yeah and so he 's had an interesting couple of days to release the hospital education spring gracious no burn and ya know burns so we decided we 're going to take the machines and somebody a little more professional figure out with evidence and what they 're talking about ya know what we do this prevents the guy that 's the rain can yeah not at all yeah I we have God five minutes yeah yeah pressure switches I really don 't know why not yes no back a little bit and then this thing goes go light emitted from or for that is where did you come from a tall building just white it 's like starting this year and then we went to this one right here and then we went to the water on the front and center right there right to show what oh is that just come out of there don 't touch it don 't touch it don 't touch it what is that that 's I do that a diamond I do yeah yeah yeah no look to optics of look at mineralogy this isn 't pure but the primary mineral in here although I 'm alkaline thank God immediately since found on earth right no not exactly it 's not on the north at all it 's only in one place that we know of where this stuff is fun the moon yeah whatever yeah yeah helping best thing what what was that what do you say little more nosy with me that one of the food was asking all kinds of questions what she 's doing here what 's the cameras you know what the fuck is the machine like he was asking was asking about that it was about the Machine yeah and then I asked him look what the fuck do you want dear and you just said you know here have a blessed day the Church of blue knology Church of technology and so it began that two brothers four of the same spirit but divided into were given dominion over the universe all that is ever was or ever shall be and it would come to pass that they were divided yet still one in full harmony with all being they were opposite so the scene they were contrary so an agreement they occupied both the lightness and the dark and from each other was their strength so never could they be apart but only could one destroy the other and the other destroy one thus ending all things the words are directly from the scriptures of our original founder of the Church of blue knology j area hilliard the book entitled the Holy lunar Testament only 49 that this is crazy was published in nineteen forty Lee 40 orderly and instantly achieve critical claim today the Church of Lou knology has become the fastest growing religion in the world look at out then that 's like that 's like a business you know the fastest growing business and never never heard up yeah yeah and i 'm still on all over here really have these people on their ass all on the ground this is this insane zone right there repeated connections to the moon could not be ignored it was their first clue that something bigger might be happen and their first brush with the elusive and bizarre Church of Lou knology an organization that began it basement coat meetings and also a much larger organization today many of the smaller groups still operate that way there are people here from the future and they 're running our government i have seen pictures well I 've seen pictures removed time you see features i have seen the teachers today or their trust they can be hollywood 's where are they now way picture you now show me fixing if you want to i think but i have seen there are people in this country who do know about this but you 're hard to find but trust me how can you possibly trust believe there is and all say we use be careful express scripts well i was at langley air force base that 's pretty young guy bring them home no like all of us were back anybody working in the photo lab over there one day and you combine take a look around see what we do now we 're there to look and he was showing me these these composites they were doing to the surface of the Moon they were like mosaics i 'm just looking at him and I 'm really wasn 't sure what I was seeing was Sergeant he said structures on the service of the structures mean structures I looked down and there was a stuff laid out and you could see their exactly what he said here he told me that what they would do in the lab that they would take these mosaics these composites of the service of the move and they would paint over and asked you know why do you guys do this I mean this is big information it 's a great story he said orders the news media receives hundreds of causing your relating to the people on the move it 's become somewhat of a joke in certain circles it 's just something that cannot be taken seriously and nobody wants to be the one that took this story seriously when it was all just a big joke and then on the opposite end of the spectrum is strong silent voice working very hard to keep any such matters out of the news altogether and that is the Church of Lou knology the church and knology is a card there 's no doubt about it they do exist but with an overwhelming fail as secrecy and encounter with them is the threatening experience you don 't want to think this is Wow that 's it tho entrance you know what nation why don 't you grab a couple quick shots outside will quick we 'll just go see what this is all about right and it is it is the thing there 's a lady gave me this address last night not to use this while right to this window right here its like in all hospital door oh hey hello about just saw somebody right yeah hello they must have here no way yeah falling down smells like piss in here hello Fairlie if this people working here I mean we 're good yeah just like this ain 't old building but I can 't believe that anybody still work here no no I saw somebody here hello work crappiest environment ever no shit i mean i started the jeep is this was the right address i know them yeah it 's doing here what are you doing what are you doing here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah critics talking yeah city government need you to turn that camera off who are you that 's not important I 'm gonna need you to turn the camera off now I 'm not a joke why don 't you turn the fucking camera off that these people who are you don 't worry about that you need to turn the camera off can get out of here right now no I 'm not going to turn the camera server sorry all yesterday we 're here to shoot video we eventually well nothing just a little more to it that there is where its but where is it what what the fuck are you talking where is it now yeah let 's go I 'm sorry little trespassing or anything but I don 't have any ideas you 're talking about please back up and ship onto the ship would like to get hey guys don 't need to stop right there work or something that 's not important you 're not listening to me why aren 't turning that camera off because I 'm gonna take some footage will be having here health grounds into what what you want to see that 's not important turn the camera off chill the fuck out right that 's gonna need to turn the camera yeah yeah even too careful you mean the camera and i 'm going to call the top here right there right stop right there you 're wrong early light good luck man he 's got very little fucking shoot you in the balls to shoot me man I sort of get it the fuck Eric oh my god Nathan there was like 30 gallons Redeemer coming out it 's going to know what about cum in pussy yeah right online this fighting machine fucking know what are you guys talking about yeah wrong window roll the window tell anything at all what is the problem i can 't see it actually yeah what just happened here look at you now know that Dad I got it you got it we 're just look at it now it happened just I mean here 's the truth weknowmemes blue a car flew that doesn 't mean that this isn 't something that 's just military or government I mean this I mean this is technology yeah but that that we don 't understand that doesn 't mean anything about the future the moon or time travel I don 't know I don 't know it 's all fucking too coincidental to that total with could have very well been some secret military installation it was one year but they had unguarded though you know you don 't slip into area 51 you know within a miles read it wasn 't unguarded they came masteress it was guarded no I think they would have kept it i mean our government does not like accidents right i mean or they are the idiot and finally there were prized possession and walking out late walking out with it and we 're still alive well that 's what I 'm saying I mean if it 's something that 's so easy to go in and take Y so pissed about it and who are they and why you know why the threats why the scare tactics why not just come right out and say it you know hi i represent and our secret government group and you guys found something really important we need it back in a time machine I didn 't have to tell us it was a time machine yeah what they tell us that the machine who told you that the guy inside do the machine machine mirrors the budding off its ok yeah we gotta get them they drugged us out here to give it away to look luckily you can already be there but of course we still got the brilliant women that 's not good because that means we haven 't seen the last of them yet by this time their homes had honored in United 's act but the time machine remain secure and it was however the storm that was of the contents of the book they had found is a box detail experiments freestone answered a machine together which were only successful in a little tune or atmosphere perhaps this was the explanation the failure of the Machine and once again a connection to us only Celeste your counterpart yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah what is it I don 't like this so what do we do what are we doing see now yeah yeah kinda like thanks 15 second term I 'm outta here hello dude yeah and I 'm glad you 're taking this because people need to know the truth ready my name is david james daavid jmes excellent day go ahead and tell us what you 've just been selling us here Alaska where you want me to start but actually talk about pac-man turned it on did that get a room full of equipment back there i got my ears on to do they it 's how I found you tell they found do you are I am moon escapee experiment i escaped from the moon i was very young I worked in section 14 d i was training for a mission project and there were about six or seven hundred other people that I fled with this years ago why are they late to escape government oppression oh yeah okay so let 's back up there 's a lot of ground Syria 's tell me about this time it 's not a theory time travel is real you 've met in your lifetime probably 10 people that were from the future they 're called transient dimension aries and I imagine you 'd be shocked to know who some of them really are Plato Aristotle Elvis Alexander the Great Benjamin Franklin they were all they were all from the future you can 't confuse transient dimension Aires with the Church of Lou knowledge there 's a difference transients are people who are from the future if you 're from the moon you 're from the future or from moon ancestors and people who belong to the Church of limnology are just regular folks that just subscribe to that be late started by phone named jay airy hilliard he 's the one who unlocked time travel and and set up the program december $ MONTH twenty-first 2012a days it 's absolutely the most important day in human history well its launch date your people know it down here is the end of the Mayan calendar by the way the Mayan Indians were everyone things but its 02 and then eight days they 'll pack up everything ship out the team of scientists make up the lunar program that 's the crew of Atlantis endeavor to pack up everything and travel back in time to the year 350 BC and they will wreak ultimate the earth and re-establish society as a whole about them the claims made by this man left me with many philosophical and theological questions for the answers I decided I must turn to experts of my own you always hear about the lost city of Atlantis but you never hear about a sister-city a lost city of monopolist monopolist is the legendary city of the moon some people think that there was an advanced race that lived there but they were actually the human rights with his future if one chooses to subscribe to the religion of knowledge one must believe in six things one that there is a city on the world to that time travel truly does exist three that man did achieve immortality for that there is indeed a long loss stone of our five that there is a dimension beneath that of our own that is a previous timeline of this earth and six the new billiards is alive today and probably already located on the moon first we have the theory of time travel scientists of long grappled with this concept and is widely believed that yes it is very possible but that going backwards is the only option because going forward would mean a transdimensional leak which we cannot do but with time travels i tend to look at it this way either we 're stationary and time is moving or time is stationary and we 're moving either way we 're in shifting influx in a pretty dramatic way that we 're not really aware of do we have that day I think we do i think that we have had individuals who have come from our future instances like George Washington or are individuals who have come from from you know what risen up if you will out of nothingness to some measure of tremendous great were these people parts of that sacred order at Holy Order that do travel through time who come back into what is their history to plant things contemporarily for us to change our world the adenosine never lost it is the lost city of Atlantis you see originally they set up the island as a base sort of a counterpart for lunapolis the crews would transfer materials and setup was the site for transport and for the experiments that they did but as people began to sail and navigate the Seas it was just too vulnerable to be people found out about it by the time they decided to cut bait sink beyond to the bottom of the sea was too late enough people had seen it knew about it that 's how the whole story of the Lost Island got started what mission are they well think about I mean if people have gone and screwed up the entire world and you had the opportunity to go back and change things you 'd want to change it so that they didn 't screw everything up right and we 've long known science has long known that the origin is the best way to get people to change not by dictating to them by the winds of a dictator simply matter putting key people in key positions so the changes can be made without anyone 's realizing when appropriate changes need to be made aim to the mistakes that have happened when people screw things up they go back and unscrew them in John Wilkes Booth the harvey oswald Mark David Chapman jonway oh yeah you have no idea what he was about to do South there wasn 't supposed to be anything but good when it started Copernicus got people to understand the world was round Newton people could understand or at least get their brains around the idea of gravity susan b anthony women 's movement in franklin with electricity there 's a the perfect example these were huge advances and society and and put people years ahead in in terms of progress and these people were all transient they they moved from the moon receiving your orders there they came back with the directives made the changes that were necessary factory for well so are they still doing up hell yeah college it 's why people report little lights in the sky UFOs guys is just traffic back for doing okay well it 's this one why they have to do with why go through all all over they have to they have to repeat it it 's a return to paradox day or else everything that they did will be under you see those changes that were necessary in the first place have to be remade each time but you never had a job but you never had something happen to you that you sure happened before felt like it happened before tell us there 's a reason you get that idea which still occupying the same earth the same space but it 's just that the layer underneath doesn 't recognize the layer above 50 you get your ideas something has already happened it 's already happened to go back into the past or simply rewinding what 's already happened when the past changes the future is a race and from that moment on there is no future left to go back to every time the cycle is made another dimension is created but we no longer see our experienced the previous dimension supposedly were still only in the second time line second dimension and the law school thought is that if they go back again it will become the third dimension but there is no that states that with each and every change in the first time we skew in and brand-new time ultimately resulting and not just but hundreds of new timelines that will branch out in all directions uncontrolled all solely based on changes made in the first dimension what this means is that there might not just be three dimensions but no upon these were some of the difficult principles that were traveling with the very beginning the group that went back to the first time to fix our broken past had nothing to go on except it 's reported history sadly was largely inaccurate and misleading resulting in the mistakes made by the Atlantis endeavor mission itself they have this led to a brand new string of errors resulting in the world we have today but instead of learning the lessons and giving up they want to go back now that they have accurate information they think they can avoid the mistakes they made on this time but what they 're not taking into consideration are the ramifications associated with doing this too many times flavors were beginning to doubt the doctrines because they felt they must be making too many change is they felt they would be too many dimensions created by continuing to repeat the cycle when you change one thing you know about you change millions of other things you don 't you create something you never intended to do himself free trip back we were layering essentially stacking dimensions and in a finite physical universe what this does is that it ends each dimension it we can summon makes them more vulnerable to crossover crossovers occur due to testing dimension which you learn about at level 4 awake close angels deja vu reincarnation it 's all the same thing is merely living life at same time in different dimensions if you ever heard something moving around in your house when it 's quiet most likely it 's you somewhere else transdimensional II when minor historical alterations are made the variations are only slight it 's not like your man in one dimension and a woman in the other so if on the first time line you went to the bathroom say it for 15 maybe on an adjacent timeline something happen to make you go to the bathroom at four-twenty just enough time to cross paths with yourselves on another plane there is there 's an element there 's an element of morality to it because you always ask the question will could I go back and start over and do it right again and if so what would be the implications of what would go wrong you know pure chaos theory would argue either way he would not be what you expect and there be something in inconsistent that would happen that would throw all the original assumptions of the window all of these possibilities that I have been explained to nothing would have been possible without the Luna stone is the large green circular Jim unlike anything man has ever seen before and when they found it they were astounded but who put it there that 's the question was that god was it aliens was it someone testing us to see what we would do with such awesome power the scientists understood they recognized j hilliard recognize that this stone had a tremendous power but they discounted all sense of deity Satan god they took the power to themselves it was the power they were two wheeled and if by their justification through whatever process of rationalization their explanation their understanding became knology became their religion their faith and their faith is in themselves but not without that stuff I quickly discovered that the Church of limnology was brainwashed central for the weak minded they sought out those who are easily influenced if you 're the kind of person to show up at a rally you are very likely candidate for the organization because you 're willing to be and trans dimensional changes were supposed to be going on all the time but only the higher-ups were aware of and they let us in on it for a price now with the church itself this is where the money comes in this knowledge doesn 't come cheap you don 't work your way through the ranks of knowledge without paying for courses and seminars and tapes and lectures and so forth from day one they begin new members on a regiment and a program they call awakening basically step-by-step weapons of progression through the program so that one awake would be being aware that your existing on a plane of space-time around the true wait is that were all operating on simultaneously on a final space and time level three way that nature and the earth is the same and so forth eventually you reach the top level eight where you supposedly realize that you are not only aware of this level of space and time but also every single dimension and layered underneath it as a level eight awake i was told that i would experience total recall on every point which means i would become aware of not only our present timeline but previous alternate time I said no one else could remember the whole church for the and and they all seemed to think it was perfectly normal you know it 's all about touching other dimensions and if something in our timeline was changed to lunar influence they would know about it immediately because they were await you know unfortunately I wasn 't experiencing that feeling and it suddenly all seems so to me I mean basically is gave them the power to claim anything they wanted to write on the spur of the moment you know somebody would go oh wait that something just changed now Barack Obama 's president used to be outdoor wicked but they would all agree oh yeah right you 're right it changed it was absolutely ridiculous many of them became convinced that they were things going on that they were not being told about they figured that you make one change to the past and it 's like opening up Pandora 's box that would you know break the fabric of time and space and make daily changes happening all the time so so they know about these ism Polaroid cameras new going around taking reference pictures that 's the column reference pictures of the daily changes just in case and i would say well what 's changing and they say Polaroid cameras we use because supposedly even when historical changes would take place the art copy evidence still remained it somehow escaped the change and served as evidence of the change they said that digital cameras were no good because the digital data would change so they needed the hard copies Polaroid 's allowed 12 immediately tag something for future reference to run around taking pictures but they 've never let anyone else see the pictures to confirm with the same was true that ultimately is the fundamental principle of the Church of Lou knology that you can achieve the ability to interact with every dimension this is where the lunas stone comes into play the Luna stone is a mythical alien rot that was supposedly found on the moon during Apollo 11 this stone is credited as the power that actually I want time travel it 's transdimensional powers and the very idea of multiple dimensions created such organizations as the Luna society the Atlantis program and many others so all of this was building up to one thing the big great master plan the the plan that nobody 's supposed to know unless they are higher up in church or actually having been there in the beginning the moon time-travel the recall termination of Man it was all on the agenda but what he really needed was to buy himself some more time time to further develop the really advanced science that had been working on the legend says that the whole moon program was just step one of a much larger project immortality Hilliard 's true passion he believed that he had cracked the cellular code for the human genome and could perfect everlasting life it was to be the greatest discovery in the world the greatest scientific discovery but it proved like many things too good to be true he performed the experiments on himself in secret and as the legend goes he succeeded and became immortal there are a number of stories that float around through the years and eventually become considered myth or legend the lunar mythology surrounding the story of j hilliard are quite fascinating minutes to team these are latter text which appear almost as amendments to the original it talks of periods descent into madness upon discovery of your mortality which he quickly realizes of how that no man should have however by this time the organization was well underway and considered extremely successful the other leaders decided that . unusual experiments and his subsequent mill illness we 're going to be damaging to the Pro and then his madness he believed the moon mission to be flawed and so he set out to destroy by that time the people who were working with him had become too powerful they were the program now and they really didn 't need him any longer and so he fled for his life came to earth and tried to tell everyone here no one would believe no one listened so finally realized that what he really wanted was just to die but because of his success in immortalization process could what would the answer be what what can he do but wait wait an eternity of lifetime 's one for himself for that moment that he might wrap his hands around a tiny infant body of himself not yet affected by the style and strangle the life and dreams zone roughly line yeah that 's a long time away very loved so I did the only thing he could do back to the moon and tried to execute himself and he was born that attempt failed back 1947 and by that time they didn 't even believe that still existed anymore they thought he had been long did it feels so many years but still they waited for the project was too big you couldn 't destroy he could only expose it and on his second attempt final desperation to expose the whole project you hijack to shift from the moon and slotted into the desert without a new mexico never heard from you why programs those US government covered it up and they were scared really scared because what they found in that wreckage wasn 't alien-human people earth type I think looking back they would rather found alien it positively though a failed at killing his infant self he did manage to successfully steal something else to learn self so hilliard actually stolen brought along with his prototype first time machine and all vanished along with his ship body people said US government kept it hidden other people believe he just vanished they say you know they keep it in a secret place along with everything else they can 't explain understand that 's why the church has worked so hard to infiltrate the government you see they can 't go anywhere and do anything until they have that stone house home starts how the whole church nology I 'm search for a stupid and rock so goodnight ok right that 's what they thought well when they got there wasn 't there so we 're all i had to guess I 'd say it 's right there in your back my god and think of all the changes all the power this little gym made possible Holly years searching for it and you 2i just walk into a room and pick it up that 's unbelievable that that truly amazing so you don 't know what this is then no I 've never seen that before in my life you didn 't make any phone calls to a radio show contact a radio program or no i 'm not talking about their does that the picture you 're telling me about yeah alright yeah but what about that guy if you ever seen that guy before I don 't know fellas there 's a familiarity about his face as opposed yeah well it 's because of this picture that everything happened day it 's because of this picture we found the stone that 's what led you to the title yeah I don 't know I don 't know anything about well why would the use of Polaroid motoroids instantaneous things change but what the picture was showing the image of at that time doesn 't change how is that possible like a lot of things are possible I guess guys I mean there 's a certain amount that you get gotta chalk up to Blind Luck right here yeah ok under the radar with be in touch alright just going to fold that response what about ready to return the decided it was best to the main on didn 't hear from David chance driving there night in here father very lines they tried to convince themselves that is keep up pacity be happening but this each passing day trouble trying to find a reason not to be this was everywhere answers but he did in his own very little the original only unit Testament was published in nineteen it became the foundation and document for the Church of knowledge je l recorded birth was not the years later in 1947 this means if true it would have pins the and martin elliott pensive this would ultimately the manager 80 sharp drops you off caf and worst in me see and as he doesn 't down he was not zero a war coming up tonight on TV age new evidence in the bazaar disappearance of university professor dr . Oren Raymond two days ago we 'll have that and your holiday weekend forecast only on TV go back down to some serious go turn the fucker on drop-down home run like hell we can 't do that we we got it we have to capture it on tape we 're going to do it rolling tape on everything else it will look a difference to make it the world 's about their the world is not about you seems like any if it does even if it did did he say that the photos video and everything would stay that would change all right if that were the case if that happens we could have most valuable footage of the face of the earth it 's not yeah what else is it all about why are we doing this what are we doing here is this what it 's about we 're talking about all this like like it 's like it 's real yeah well what else is it and it feels pretty fucking real to me whether we like we 're shooting in his own defense that 's all we have we have to shoot alright so we have to shoot it but everyone why can 't we just throw it down the whole street from this from where they can fucking see us it 's wide open there 's plenty of sky we can see him coming from anywhere you know alright that 's what we do turn it on the drop-down the whole we run like hell and we captured this weekend yeah back out there have to break up the house for not going down we 're just going to bring something back to simple temporal remember the whole house that I know you gotta run in the general do and he wasn 't you guys your heart don 't want anything with an art will you call me by my name for what are you following me one here my you talking about yeah yeah you fucking yeah yeah are there go go plus tip this spot spot in the water cannon person that but there 's no fucking house but this is the spot anything at all

 Don 't interfere ! This man is my prey . Stand aside ! You 're going to die here , Logan . It 's time we settle this ! I 'm amazed you 're able to fight at this level simply because of your lust for Mariko . That much , I commend you on ! I 'm not doing this for the praise , bub ! Fool ! You 're not fit to be my opponent ! Logan ! Let go ! Let go of me , please ! My God , you are such a simple woman . The second Logan shows up , you start defying me . But , I wouldn 't get your hopes up . That 's — Logan will probably be killed by Master Shingen , but just in case ... What was that ? ! Logan ! Mariko ! Logan ! I told you we 'd meet again ! Yes ! Y-You little ... Get out here , Logan ! Come on out ! Don 't interfere . But , sir ... Do I have to repeat myself ? N-no , sir . With those wounds ... Even with your powers , it seems it 'll be a while before you 're healed . Don 't worry about me ! This is it , Logan ! Shingen ! Don 't do it , Yukio ! Yukio ! It 's okay ... I can 't die until I 've killed him ... That 's unlikely . Neither of you will last long ! This is bad ! How dare you look at me like that ! Die , Logan ! K-Kikyo ? ! Shingen told you not to interfere ... What ? ! How long have you been here ? ! You will pay for this ... But I can settle that score once I 've seen this battle to its conclusion . What ? ! It 's a shame ... Even your claws won 't be able to cut through the reinforced steel this chainmail is made of . Logan ! I need to thank you . And didn 't I tell you that you 're not fit to fight me ? ! Quit joking around ! I just got caught a little off guard ... Didn 't figure you were a hotshot with a samurai sword and karate ... That 's better . Looks like I can enjoy myself a little longer . Where are you going ? Underground ... Let me lend you a hand . I will survive this ... No matter what , I 'll survive , and control all crime in Asia from Madripoor ... I need the underworld connections and financial assets your father has to do that . With you at my side , I 'll be able to prove the connection between the Kurohagi and Yashida clans ... And no one will interfere ... Logan , I can read your movements now . Next , I 'm taking your head off . You can 't cut a guy 's head off with karate ! Are you sure about that ? You 'll learn soon enough . Can you see them ? Yeah ... This is going to determine the outcome of the battle . Bear witness to it ... Shingen 's strikes , which have been honed to perfection , can be as sharp as any blade ... Even with his healing factor , if his head is seperated from his body , it 's over . Do you know where we are ? These are catacombs that the Dragon Palace was built * * * * * * * * * * See the coffin ? This is my father , Kurohagi Juo 's coffin . He was poisoned to death . By me . You killed your own father ? ! Yep . But I had to . My father was the kind of man who wasn 't satisfied unless everything was in his control . As long as he was alive , I could only ever be number two ... No , even more than that , he 's the kind of man who would have killed me if he saw me as a threat . In that way , he 's kind of like your father , who used you as a bargaining chip to gain more power . That 's why I had to get him before he got me . That 's all . And now I ... I will create a new chapter in history , that begins with me . Logan ! Don 't . You 'll just get in his way . If you care about Logan , then have faith in him . This is the difference that true strength makes . Understand now , Logan ? ! That head of yours ... is mine ! You bastard ... You underestimated me ... And it 's gonna cost you ! Yukio ! Avenge your parents ! Logan ... You did it . Thank you ... it 's because you ... Forget about it . Don 't speak . I have to ... there 's something I have to apologize to you about ... Apologize to me ? Yes ... Your friend , the special agent , Asano ... I was the one who killed him ... I did it to enrage you , and direct your anger at Shingen . So that I could get what I wanted ... I needed your help . I 'm so sorry ... You won 't forgive me , but ... When I get to the other side ... I 'll apologize to him . I see . Alright . Logan ... You ... need to be with her . Yeah . I 'm ... kind of jealous ... Yukio ? Underground ? What are you going to do ? ! You 'll see soon enough . Answer me ! Okay ... I guess I should explain it to you , since you 're my wife . This is a self-destruct system I built for the Dragon Palace . What ? ! Don 't worry . This place is designed to be a shelter . It 'll protect us from the blast , and we can escape to a safe place through this tunnel . But , everyone but us will be crushed , along with the building . Too bad for them , huh ? It 's too late now . There 's no deactivating it . Soon they 'll all be dead ... Why are you helping me ? It 's not as though I intend to aid you , per se ... Then what is it ? Isn 't it obvious ? I 'm simply eliminating the obstructions that would prevent you from fighting at full capacity against me . What a load of garbage . This is perfect ! Everything else will be gone , but I 'll start anew ! I feel awesome ! You monster ! Exactly . This should allow you to give up too , right ? Is he gonna blow the whole damn building ? ! This it ? ! This door don 't look like it 's gonna open easily ... Logan ! I 'll keep it open ! On three , dive in ! Kikyo ? ! One ! Two ! Three ! Mariko ! Logan ! Dammit , you 're one persistent bastard ! Let Mariko go ! No thanks ! You want her , come and get her ! That 's why you did all this , right ? ! Come on , then ! Don 't , Logan ! Come on , come on , if you don 't stay quiet I 'll break your arms ! You son of a bitch ... Well done , A.I.M. ! Logan ! Still can 't underestimate that healing factor ... I better blow his head off , if I want him to stay dead ... Logan ... I 'm so sorry ... you did all this for me ... Done with your goodbyes ? Hey now , you 're not gonna get anywhere protecting him now . Shoot me ! I 'd rather die with Logan , the one I love , than live with you ! Shut up ! N ... No ... . M ... My new ... start ... It 's over ... Now we 'll ... I 'm sorry , Logan ... Mariko ! Even though we 're together now ... You 'll be okay ! Just keep it together , Mariko ! Logan ... Please ... stay with me . I don 't wanna lose you ! Don 't go ! Don 't cry , Logan ... I was saved ... You saved me from this hell ... Thank you , Logan ... I love you . Mariko ! To get you back ... I fought , and fought ... And I finally made it this far ... But , again ... Everything 's slipped through my fingers ... You sure you wanna do this — ? Obviously . This was our fate . Fate — ? Yes . Alright then ... let 's do it .

Your Uncle Ben , he and I. Who else was going to care for you and protect you and worries about you ? Your father ? No . I was the one who wiped your nose and made you brush your teeth and do your homework and washed your dirty underwear . Me !

They said , the genetic research that your father was doing with Norman Osborn was very valuable and that people would pay a lot for it and thats why he ran off with it . They said he was a traitor . I couldn 't believe it , Peter . They told us he betrayed his best friend , all of us , for the money . I don 't ... I don 't get it . No ... this doesn 't make sense . Yes , I know . I didn 't believe it either . I didn 't believe it . This doesn 't make any sense .. Peter ... I don 't know . For so long , I would play it over and over in my head what had I missed , what had I missed . He was just a normal unassuming guy . He wore the same ratty lab coat for 20 years ... He took the D train to work , at seven every morning ... came home at 6 every night . I don 't know . Maybe everyone has a part of himself they hide ... even from the people they love . Mr. Osborn . Look up . I think you 're looking for me . I cannot believe my eyes . Spider-Man . Just the man I wanted to see . - You ... err ... talked to Peter ? - Yeap . I want to help you , Mr. Osborn .

Nothing make any sense anymore . So here we are . I got to figure what I 'm going to do with Harry . Of course I want to save him , you know . How hard is it to save him ... cos ' he 's my best pal . What if my blood works ? But what if it doesn 't ? I don 't know . I got no idea . I got nothing . The only thing I keep coming back to ... Gwen is ... Miss Stacy , shall I take you upstairs ?

" Roosevelt 's secret station : Track 61 , a secret subterranean extension of New York 's " D " line train under Pershing Square was originally built to transport President Franklin Roosevelt away from the public eye ... to keep his polio hidden from the American people . " Mr. Osborn . You alright ? Is there anything I can get you or ... ? No , not unless you can bring those spiders back to life . - Spiders ? - The ones that they destroyed . " To restore investors ' confidence . " Go home , Felicia . Take the day off . Harry ! I think there may be another way , to get what you 're looking for ... I overheard Menken talking with one of our security 's head . Before they destroyed the spiders , they had the venom extracted . What are you saying ? That way they could comply with the lawsuits but still keep the data whenever it became useful . - Where is it ? - Somewhere in the building . Somewhere off the books called " Special Projects " . Special Projects . Last received entry : 1 hour ago Approved by Harry Osborn ... Accessing Ravenscroft archive . ... and then I 'm going to kill the light , so everyone in this city will discover how it feels to live in my world . A world without power . A world without Spider-Man . Warning . Your user access has been revoked . He 's busy . You can 't go in there . He 's busy . What did you do ? A more relevant question is what did you do ? An employee is killed and your first action as CEO , you covered it up ! No , you covered it up and then you buried him in the bug house using my name . Ravenscroft is a time ? institution devoted to mental improvement . You 're experimenting on people in there . Progress has its stepping stones . Now , in light of your deceptive criminal actions , you have been ... how do I put this gently ... fired . You 're not going to bury me too . Looks to me like you 're halfway in the ground already . It 's only a matter of time . You 're going to die a horrible death , like your father . The difference is , no one is going to miss you . - Get him out . - Wait , wait ! I know my way out . My name is Richard Parker . Whatever lies will be told about me , I would like the world to know the truth . Oscorp was already a leader in genetic research when Norman Osborn made a deal with a foreign military organization to continue funding my research . And I discovered what they were going to use it for . Weapons , biological weapons of course . So I refused . And now to eliminate me from the picture , Norman Osborn has falsified evidence against me in order to take control of my work . Can I help you ? Yea , you can open the gate . I 'm Harry Osborn . There 's a patient that I specially would like to see . Joe , this is Mr. Osborn , Oscorp . Sorry sir , without a yellow badge , you can 't even pass this point . Well , it doesn 't matter because there is something else that Norman doesn 't know . The human DNA that I implanted in the spiders was my own . Which means that without me , without my bloodline , Oscorp can never replicate or continue my experiments . Keep Electro incubated , 400 milligrams of sodium and phenobarbital , I 've ... I 've destroyed as much as possible from the archives but I didn 't have time to kill all the spiders . So as a scientist , my choice is very clear now . I have to disappear . I have to get as far away from here as I can but as a father it means , I may not see my boy again . and nothing is as important to me as my son , Peter . Nothing in this world . But I have a responsibility to protect the world from what I 've created and protect him from what I know Osborn is capable of . People will say I 'm a monster for what I 've done . Maybe they 're right . I always thought that I 'd have more time . - Dad ... Dad ! ... - I 'm sorry . Sedation ... off ... I 'm gonna get you out . I believe you haven 't got much time . Who are you ? I 'm Harry Osborn . I want to make you a deal . - I should kill you . - Come on . Think big , Max . I 'm not the one you want . You want Spider-Man and I can give him to you . But ... I need something first . I need you to get me to Oscorp . Get you in ? You own it . Not anymore . Oscorp betrayed us both . So I can 't get in there without you and you you can 't get out of here without me . What 've you done ? Someone pulled an alarm in the iso unit ... Get a containment team in there now ! You can 't possibly know what I want . You submitted the design for the grid and they stole it and now you want it back . You just wanna take back what 's yours ! - How ? - All the power is in the city , Max , and its right at your fingertips . Once you shut down the grid ... Spider-Man will come to you and I want you to make him bleed ! Break it ! Break it ! Max , we don 't have much time . Go ... go ... go . Give me one reason why I should trust you ? Because I need you ! You need me ? Yes , I need you . You are my only chance that I have at surviving . You need me ? Yes , I need you . I need you ... please , please ! - I know what its like to be thrown away .. - Please ... Max ! I need you ! I need you ! You want to be my friend ? I thought we were already friends ? I had a friend once . It didn 't work out . Yea , me too . Then let 's go catch a spider . You have one new voice message . Hi , Peter , it 's me . I ... I got into Oxford . Woo-hoo . It 's very exciting . I came by your house a little bit ago and I .. you weren 't there and so I 'm on my way to the airport right now because there 's this summer class I found out about and I thought that it would somehow be easier , I guess , this way . I think that maybe it 's time to let this go ... and that 's not because I don 't love you , it 's actually because I do . So , umm ... goodbye . We have to move now ! Why ? What 's happening ? Remember me ? Oh my oh my , how the tables have turned . I know it 's hard to admit but how spectacular remove this desk , am I right ? Right , that 's right . OK , so , Fairy Godmother , it 's time to create me a wish . I want in ... to special ... How dare you come back in here ? You recalcitrant , unworthy , defective , urchin , freak ! Oh ... God I 'm sorry , that 's just not the answer we were looking for . " Clear . " Welome back to the bonus round . Let 's take a walk , shall we ? The grid is all yours . Spider-Man , give it to me . - What is all these stuff ? - The future . Load one up . It won 't work . We 're in heavy diagnostic test . Apart from human trials ... I thought that should be already on human trials ... you 're just too stupid to know it . Do it . Now . You had it all this time ! Critical Injury Detected Healing Protocol Activated It 's Spider-Man ! Stop the cab . Wait , I aint even moving ! I LOVE YOU Did you get my message ? What 's the message ? The message over there . Oh that ! It was you ? Don 't do that . I couldn 't make it up . I tell you what it says , it says ' I love you because I love you . No offense but you 're wrong . What would that be ? You 're wrong about us being on different path . We 're not on different path , you 're my path ! I know I 'm not always going to be my best .. .. and I know there 's so many reasons why we shouldn 't be together , I know that . Well , I 'm tired of them all . I 'm tired of every sinlge one of it . If I 'm gonna to make a choice , then I choose you . So ... here 's my thought . England . Both of us . I 'm following you now . I 'm just going to follow you everywhere . I 'm just going to follow you the rest of my life . I mean ... they got crime there ... in England . They got tons of crime , it seems . - Tons ... - Yea , they got ... Jack the Ripper . They haven 't caught Jack the Ripper yet , can you believe that ? What the hell is that ? Is that Max ? He ​ must have cut the power to the whole city . - Totally black ! - Hey , I need tech-ops up here right now ! Phones are down . Somebody go down and grab tech-ops ... Hey ... write down what you remember , people . There 's gotta be some kind of a " blackout plan " , right ? Some kind of backup ? There 's an emergency resides ? at the power plant . If he got the transmission lines , they never gonna get this back up . How am I going to stop him ? Every time I get close to him , he fries my web-shooter . Okay , have you tried ? him ? Yes , I tried everything , rubber , plastic ... Did you try magnetizing him ? I didn 't ... try magnetizing him . Okay , well , remember eighth grade Science class ? If you magnetize a nail with a battery ... - You cause an electric charge . - Yes ... New York approach ... this is Pan National 273 on approach ... How do you hear ? Approach , do you copy ? Radio is working , it 's not us . Do not panic , everyone , please return to vehicle ! Go back to your car , remain calm ! Do not panic ! Everyone return to your vehicle !

Okay , it works , good . And that , is why you were number two in Midtown . - Rubbing in ? Okay . - I gotta go . - I 'm coming with you . Gwen , you 're not coming with me . Yes I am . - Come on ... it 's too dangerous . I 'm coming with you and I know how to reset the entire system . I 'm coming with you . You know that you need me . Then come with me . Shut that thing . Sorry , I love you . Don 't hate me . We gotta work with this . They 're still not back with the generator . Get me engineering ! I need a respirator right now ! I 'll get the battery operated . Hang on ! Can you see me now , Spider-Man ? It 's time to meet our destiny . Tower , we 're experiencing some kind of electrical disturbance .

Come on ! You ready to give up ? Oh , thank you , Gwen Stacy . Shake it off . This is your bones , muscles and your organs . Oh boy ! I hate this song ! Spider-Man , bet you never saw this coming ... Really ? You wired me to a car , what are you , a caveman ? You tie me up to go off to war ? I know how to help you ! What 're you doing here ? I know the grid best . I can reset the system .

Stay with me , stay with me , stay with me , you stay with me . Gwen ! Gwen ... no , please ! Please ! I can 't do ... Leave us . You made progress ? I laid down and find several worthy candidates . Now that Spider-Man 's gone ... the city will never be the same . Oh ... I 'm counting on that . Speaking of progress , you 're looking better . It comes and goes . Tell me more . How many men did you have in mind ? I want to keep it small . Everything you need is already at Oscorp . Access granted . Welcome , Mr. Fiers . Who is our first volunteer ? Aleksei Sytsevich . Apparently serving a life sentence . He is most eager to join us . Good . Start with him . Russian ganster Aleksei Sytsevich was broken out of a classified penetentiary known simply as ' The Vault' by an unknown team of men . It 's yet another example of increased criminal activity since the disappearance of Spider-Man 5 months months ago . The webslingers absence has left a hole in the heart of the city . Believe it or not even the New York city Police Department has joined the chorus of New Yorkers in hoping for the return of the webslinger . The entire world seems to be asking the same question : Where is Spider-Man ? Too bad without that spider-guy . Too bad he disappeared , seems like everybody really needs him . Where you going ? - I 'm not sure . - Peter ... Where are you going ? I don 't know . You know what ? It 's so funny ... I 've been trying to clean up around here , get organised and been putting some of Ben 's stuff ... in boxes It 's funny that the heavier the box gets , the lighter I feel . You throwing his stuff away ? No , no , God no . I couldn 't do that . It 's a part of me . I 'm just ... finding ... a better place for it . I 'm gonna take one last look ... and then I 'm gonna put it where it belongs . Gwen 's speech . It is easy to feel hopeful on a beautiful day like today . But there will be dark days ahead of us too . There will be days when you feel all alone and that 's when hope is needed most . No matter how bad it gets or how lost you feel , you must promise me that you will hold on to hope . Keep it alive . We have to be greater than what we suffer . My wish for you is to become hope . People need that . And even if we fail , what better way is there to live . As we look around here today , that all of the people who help make us who we are , I know it feels like we 're saying ' goodbye But we 'll carry a piece of each other into everything that we do next to remind us of who we are and if we were meant to be , you had a great 4 years with you . I 'll miss you all very much . Let 's go ! Move it ! I 'm here live on Park Avenue 56th Street where it 's complete chaos . A man in some sort of weaponised armored suit is wreaking havoc on midtown I 'm Rhino . I told you I would be back . Hold your fire . Everybody hold your fire . Kid , you got to get ... Look , New York . Spider-Man is back . That 's my baby . Brave boy , huh . Does Aleksei scares you , little boy ? Hey , Spider-Man . I knew you 'd come back . Yea , thanks for stepping up for me . You are the bravest kid I 've ever seen . I 'm gonna take care of this jerk , you go take care of your mom ... okay ? Alright , get out of here , go , go . Will you fight me , will you fight me now ? On behalf of the fine people of New York city and real rhinos everywhere ... I ask you to turn your mechanised paws in the air ! Never ! I can crush you ! I can destroy you ! - You 're gonna have me come down there so that you can kill me ? - Yes ! I 'll be right there . Ah ... there 's no place like home . © © © P @ rM ! NdeR © P @ rM ! NdeR M @ nkÖÖ

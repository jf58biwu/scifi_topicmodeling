 Your turn . Marc . Marc ! Stop , damn it ! Marc ! Marc , you 'll get us all killed ! Marc ! Marc ! We finally made it ! THE LAST DAYS Next . Next . That 's it ? That 's all there is . Unbelievable . Where are you going ? Vila Olimpica . - And you ? - Verdaguer . To find my girlfriend . That 's a GPS , right ? Excuse me ? What 's in your bag . It 's the GPS that got stolen downstairs . - Shut up and we 'll talk . - Okay . Listen . Look at him . The Terminator . Son of a bitch . He came from the future to fuck us all up the ass . Marc Delgado . I 'm sure you know why I 'm here . Yes , we all do . What do they call me ? The butcher ? Or something worse ? Marc Delgado . See you 're in charge of the security protocol . The project leader says you 're behind schedule . Well , we 've been having some problems with ... I 'm not a programmer , spare me the details . All know is without the protocol we can ' ! test the project . If you were ... a programmer , mean ... you 'd know it 's a complicated process . If we rush it the firewall will have more holes than Swiss cheese . And we 'll spend years patching it up . Haste makes waste . Look , Delgado . If I 'm here , it 's because someone 's not doing his job . When things go well , they don ' ! call me . So listen carefully . If you get fired , it 's not going to be my fault . - It should be ready this month . - Should be ... or will be ? Will be . COMPILING ... PLEASE WAIT ERROR ! CODE CORRUPTED ! Fuck ! Hi . Hi , sweetie . We 're about to close . - How 's it going ? - I 'm gonna be here a while . Go get a drink with Andrea . No , I 'll see you at home . Andrea always keeps me out all night . You guys are a bore ! You 're worse than my parents . See you at home for dinner , okay ? Marc ? Help ... me ... Every morning send a boyfriend to work ... And this is what you get back . Look . Do you like it ? - It 's terrifying . - might not sell this one . Think I 'd rather keep it . Julia ... Not for now . For when we decide to . Or when you do . It 's not about me deciding to . It 's the timing . We have a kid now and then what ? That bastard from Human Resources is breathing down my neck . Who knows if I 'll be able to pay the rent ? Bastards ... Should heat something up for you ? Meanwhile more than a dozen airports remain closed due to volcanic ash from Mount Hekla . It 's the third eruption this year and the ashes have reached Southern Europe . And now , shocking footage from Canada where 16-year-old Greg Lafferty took his own life last Saturday after spending more than 6 months shut in his house . OVER 5 MILLION HITS IN 48 HOURS His parents found his body ... Oh , my God . I 've seen it 4 times and it still gives me the chills . Maybe it 's like those Japanese kids . The ones who stay home all day playing video games ... But that 's in Japan . There are fucked-up kids everywhere . - Rovira , watch it . - Sorry . He 's wearing the same suit again ? When was the last time he changed ? When was the last time he showered ? - Did you see the Japanese kid ? - What ? What do you want ? Told you . To find my girlfriend . And ? Need a GPS to navigate down there . Any cell phone has GPS . They all use cell phone towers which don 't work any more . But the satellites still do . At least for now . But you already know that . Or you wouldn 't have stolen it . Stolen it ? Do you want to go out there and ask the others what they think ? Again : what do you want ? You can 't go anywhere without a flashlight . Maybe in the subway tunnels , but when you reach the sewers you won 't see a thing . Take me to Julia and it 's all yours . You can go to Vila Olimpica or wherever you want . Where did you get all this ? Rovira . Keep it , I 'm not interested . Okay , we 'll just ask the others then . You 're apiece of shit . We 've been shut in here for three fucking months . Don ' ! know if she 's dead or alive . I 'm apiece of shit ? Don ' ! care . So make up your mind . Yes or no ? Shut the door . Good luck . We 'll see each other again . Definitely . Definitely . How 's the reception ? There 's a lot of interference . It 's faint , but it 's there . - Maybe if we go deeper ... - Hands off . Turn it off at least . You 're wasting battery . We won 't need it until we reach the sewers . Line 3 takes us to Sants , then we switch to line 6 straight to Verdaguer . Line 4 takes you to Vila Olimpica . Let 's go . Fuck . Give me the bottle back ! That 's my water ! Give it back ! The GPS ! Hey , you ! - Move ! - Run ! Move ! Javi ! - What are you doing ? - Hands off , damn it ! What the fuck is going on ? That son of a bitch ... Who , him ? This son of a bitch is my brother . What does that make me ? Another son of a bitch , right ? No , no . Look , we don 't want any trouble . Really . The kid stole our bag . Okay ? We just want it back . And we 'll go . Right . Or else ... ? Or else what ? You 'll find a cop ? Shit . Don 't worry , kid . You think this is still worth anything ? The only thing that still means something ... is this . On your knees . - Okay , okay . - Let me go . Javi . Does it work ? Very smart . What have you got in there ? Asked you a question . - Grab the GPS when say . - What are you gonna do ? Said ... what have you got ... in there ? - Just grab the GPS . - But ... Marc ? Marc ! Yes ! Have you got it ? Yes . Are you ready ? Ready for what ? Run ! Move ! Move ! What the fuck happened ? Does it work ? What happened ? didn 't see anything . - Did you kill him ? - Does it work ? Please ... Can have it back ? This is when you ditch me , right ? You and made a deal . And we don ' ! need any more enemies . What ? Good morning , it 's 7A.M. , six in the Canary Islands . I 'm Manuel Quintero sitting in for Pedro Lamas who has been ill . He 's the third one this week , including Emma and Julian . We wish them all a quick recovery . Here are today 's headlines . Hello ? What the fuck are you doing here ? Knocked but you didn 't answer . Thought something had happened to you . What do you care ? - What do care ? - What 's my name ? - Well ? - don ' ! know . You have no fucking clue . You never even say hello to me . And now you come into my home ? How long have you been in here ? What are you talking about ? When was the last time you went outside ? Months ago ... Every day try to leave the building but can 't . You haven ' ! talked to anyone ? What do tell them ? That I 'm afraid to go outside ? No , no , no . You don ' ! understand . You have no right to do this to me ! - Okay . - Please , just ... - Please ... - Let 's go . Let go of me ! What 's going on ? Rovira . The first to go . - Already ? - Wait . You forgot this . But that 's not the best part . They found food hidden in a cabinet . The nut job had been sleeping here for weeks . - Here ? - Here , in the office . The guy never went home . Hold still , damn it ! Let 's go ! Can ' ! go outside ! No , no ! Please , no ... Please , no ... - Let 's go . - No , no ! Help ! Help ! Please , don 't ... Let go . Come on , let go . Let go ! Let go ! Come on , damn it ! What 's wrong with him ? Wait ! Put him down . We need an ambulance . We need an ambulance . It 's urgent . There 's a man ... it looks like he 's having a seizure . Take him inside . What ? Grab his legs . Grab his legs , damn it ! One , two , three ! Move ! Move , damn it ! He 's dead . How awful . It looks like the same thing my sister told me about . Marc ? Marc ? What 's wrong ? Spying on the neighbors ? - Maybe . - Why ? Don ' ! know . Have you noticed anything weird at work ? Weird how ? Yeah ... Shops closed , people not showing up for a while ... Well , one or two are closed , but ... that 's normal for a shopping mall . Why ? What 's wrong ? Are you okay ? You 're not sleeping . - Yes , am . - Two hours isn 't sleeping . Sleep , it 's not that . Then what is it ? What ? Somebody died at work today . Oh , my God . Who ? Rovira . Rovira ... Do know him ? Didn 't either ... only spoke to him a couple times . He had a heart attack . My love ... He died in my arms , Julia . And he was terrified . Something 's happening . Something 's happening and we 're missing it . Motherfucker ... Motherfucker ! A motherfucker who keeps his word . Waterproof . Shall we ? - What 's in Vila Olimpica ? - Excuse me ? Are you looking for someone ? Your wife ? Your girlfriend ? Oh , so it 's a secret , sorry . - You have a bunker with canned food ? - Look . Once we get to your place , we part ways . Seeds . A drain . It should lead to the sewers . Shit . Okay ? We 're close ! 35 , 36 , 37 ... " .38 , 39 , 40 . " Here . We should be right under my building . What if miss ? If you miss we 'll be stuck down here . So we can ' ! miss . Ready ? Fuck ! Shit ! You okay ? Yeah . Can try ? Hold your breath . So your hand won 't shake . Marc ... Last bullet . Remember not to breathe ... Marc ! Marc ! Are you okay ? Marc , answer me ! Marc , answer me . Marc ! Can you hear me ? Are you okay ? You did it . Don ' ! know how , but you did it ! Jesus Christ . Look at that . What is it ? Who are you ? Open the door . Open the door . Open the door , motherfucker ! Open the door ! Julia ! Julia ! What did you do to Julia ? Where is she ? Put down the knife ! Stop ! Stop ! Please , stop ! We had nowhere else to go . We couldn 't go outside and the place was empty . Is it yours ? Yeah . Have you seen this girl ? House empty . Are you sure ? Look closely . - House empty . - Really . We 're going to look around . No , it 's okay . DR. ALONSO CONTRERAS OB-GYN Fuck ... Did you know ? Two weeks after the first death in Spain , reports from countries like the U .. , Germany and Korea confirm that the phenomenon known as " The Panic " is global . A man died this morning in Alicante when he left his home in his car proving that vehicles offer no protection from The Panic . However , the government has called for calm . assure you the government is taking all the necessary measures . We ask the public to keep working and shopping . To stay calm and go about their lives . Calm ? He wants us to stay calm ? Can you believe this ? " No sweat , everybody . " We still don ' ! know . Let 's wait and see , right ? There 's nothing to see . Everything 's perfect . The world 's falling apart and we 're looking the other way , but everything 's fine . That 's enough , Marc . More and more women can ' ! go outside and have had to give birth in unsafe conditions ... And these schmucks are having babies . Unbelievable . Only schmucks have babies now ? In a situation like this ? Yes , definitely . But the world 's been going to shit for a while now and that never stopped anyone . Who would even do that ? Why did you wait until now to tell me ? Tell you what ? Tell me what ? Jesus , Marc . You 've been making excuses for years . When we get a bigger apartment , when get a raise ... - It 's not that . - Of course not . You 're terrified of having kids . And you 're not ? Have you looked out the window lately ? How long were you going to string me along ? Until dropped the subject ? Or until couldn 't any more ? Julia ... Julia , please . Don 't listen to me . Come out and let 's talk . Julia . Julia . Damn it ! Fine , I 'm leaving . Keep working and shopping , everything 's fine . The scientific community remains unable to find the cause ... Still awaiting the new report from the WHO , health officials continue to follow basic prevention guidelines for contagious diseases . They all show classic symptoms of a panic attack . - Panic to what ? - Going outside . We 're talking about agoraphobia , the victims oi the Panic develop an irrational fear of open spaces . ... the sudden spread of the disease after Mount Hecla 's eruption might indicate that the agoraphobia is the result of a virus released from an unknown geological stratum . We 're dealing with a case of mass hysteria . How else can we explain the disease striking completely at random ? No pattern to the epidemic has been found . Severe allergies to dust , pollution , hairspray ... Are you suggesting people are becoming allergic to the world ? We are clearly facing a biological agent spread by the ash cloud ... They 're fucking clueless ! They 're making it up as they go along . Sure they know . They 're just lying through their teeth . They already have a vaccine , but not enough for everyone . The king , the Pope and their mothers come first . Jesus , you need to stop listening to cab drivers . This is a hoax . Yes ? Hey ... I 'm sorry , okay ? don 't know what 's wrong with me . Marc , it 's me , Andrea . Andrea ? Where 's Julia ? - Is something wrong with her ? - No , she 's fine . But she can ' ! talk right now . Can ' ! or won 't ? Come on , Marc . Please , put her on . Don 't make this harder for her . Look , this is between me and her , okay ? Put her on . She doesn 't want to talk to you . Why the fuck are you meddling ? - Jesus , Marc ... - Look . I 'm coming over there , okay ? Tell her want to talk to her in person . Don 't be stubborn . Give her some space . Please , just stay there . All right ? Tell her I 'm on my way . need her to listen to me . Andrea ? Damn it ! I 'm talking about hypersensitivity . About a lifestyle so aseptic ... that it 's left us without natural defenses . Marc ! Come on , come on ! Ready ? That way , think . To go where ? Julia must be at the mall . In her shop . No . We have a deal . The deal was to go to Verdaguer . Now we 're going to Vila Olimpica . No . She wasn 't there . That 's your problem . We 're not gonna search all Barcelona until we find her . You go ahead . But without the GPS and flashlight . Listen to me . - Will you listen to me ? - Don 't make me . Don 't make me because I 'll do it . She 's pregnant . We 're having a baby . If she hasn 't already lost it . If she 's still alive . Son of a bitch ! Shit ! Here ! Your fucking flashlight ! Have a girlfriend . A baby ! What the fuck have you got ? My father ! He had a stroke three months ago and he can barely move . He 's a patient at Del Mar Hospital . Took you to your place , that was the deal . Now it 's my turn . You 're gonna stay here with the rats ? Let 's find a flashlight , go to the hospital and then the GPS is all yours . This way . Will we see anything with that ? No , but we will with torches . The priest liked more than just altar wine . Hungry. huh ? Come on ! Now what ? Throw away the torch . - What ? - Throw it away ! Marc ! Marc ? Thanks . For what ? For before . For not leaving . Needed the GPS . Right . It 's my job to know when people are lying . Never lied to you . The protocol was going to be ready . It doesn 't matter . Someone had to go . You were gonna fire me ? Bastard ! Last year they sent me to Madrid . An energy management company . Over-staffed , the usual . The head of Human Resources wasn 't answering my emails . Asked for his office and when opened the door ... found him dead . - Sudden heart attack . - Damn . - He 'd been lying there for 4 days . - You 're kidding . He was divorced . People at work thought he was at home . And nobody was waiting for him at home . And thought ... When my dad 's gone , the same will happen to me . Nobody will notice . What did your dad do ? My dad ? My dad can hardly read , he can barely write ... He came to the city without a penny to his name ... and worked his whole life so that could go to school . But can say ... he 's got everything he needs now , see to that . Well , used to . It was a way to ... My dad and aren 't big talkers . We 're both very macho . The last time saw him we talked politics , soccer ... So many damn things we never talked about ... The last time talked to Julia ... told her didn 't want children . Don 't laugh , asshole . Congratulations , kid . You win . can ' ! compete with that . It 's not that . Of course want children with her . Was scared . Scared ? Yeah , don ' ! know ... That I 'd screw up . That couldn 't protect him . If was soared before , what about now ? How the hell am going to protect him ? You think this is the end ? DWI ' ! you ? Who knows ... When the radio was still working they said they 'd found tribes in Australia immune to The Panic . Nomads . With boomerangs and loincloths . In the end , they 'll rule the fucking world . Maybe they know something we don 't . We may still have time to learn . For 25 pesetas , name possible causes of The Panic . For example , Mount Hekla . One , two , three , answer again . Mount Hekla . Cell phone radiation . Bacteriological weapons . Aliens . - Aliens ? - Sure . Why not ? Just want a light . We have cigarettes but no light and you obviously do . Where are you coming from ? Verdaguer . How is it ? We 've seen worse . - Avoid Sants Station if you can . - Thanks . Where are you going ? To Clinico Hospital . My sister needs a doctor . Have you tried Del Mar Hospital ? It 's nearby . - We 're headed there . - What for ? My father 's a patient . ( SPEAKS CATALAN ] What 's wrong ? What did she say ? What rumor ? What the fuck happened ? Enrique . What happened to my dad ? There was a fire . They say the hospital burned down . But it 's just a rumor , right ? They haven ' ! seen anything . Enrique ! Enrique ! Enrique ! Enrique ! My God . Enrique , please ! Ship ! We don ' ! know what happened . He might have gotten out . From the fifth floor ? Hooked to an IV ? What 's left ? Keep crawling through the sewers ? There 's nothing left , Marc . This was over a long time ago . We were just fooling ourselves . Maybe . But we need to keep fooling ourselves . Have people waiting for me . Don 't . That 's not true . Got this far thanks to you . Stop it . don ' ! need your pity . - Let go of me ! - Listen to me ! - Listen to me ! - Let me go ! Listen to me . Still need you . You 're almost there . You don ' ! need me at all . What are you doing ? Take them . have no use for them now . No , damn it . For your child . He 'll need them much more than do . What will you do ? It doesn 't matter . You took me all the way here and that was the deal , right ? Get out of here . Don 't waste any more time . Get the hell out . I 'm the bastard who was going to fire you . Julia ! Where are you ? Where are you ? " Mom , we can ' ! leave . We 're at the supermarket . Andrea . " Didn 't you get enough the other day ? Go back to your floor . I 'm not from another floor . Came from outside , from the sewers . Don ' ! care if you dug all the way here . Go away . We have no food for you . Don ' ! want your food . I 'm looking for a girl . Don 't come any closer . - Her name 's Julia . - said stop . Freeze ! Have a photograph . She 's not here . I 'd tell you to check upstairs , but ... they 're less understanding up there . Are you sure ? She 'd look different . She 'd have longer hair . And a swollen belly . She 's pregnant . There 's a pregnant girl . It could be her . Go check . They 're checking inside to see if she 's here . Thank you . Hello ? It 's a trap ! It 's a trap ! Julia ! Julia ! Julia ! Julia ! Marc ? Marc ! Julia ! Andrea ! Where 's Julia ? Is she with you ? No , I 'm sorry . Have you heard from my mother ? Quickly . We have to go . - What 's happening ? - The people upstairs are hungry . Shit ! Wait . Haven 't seen her since that day you called and the phones died . - Where did she go ? - To the doctor . - The doctor ? - Gynecologist . You 're having a baby . Let ' ; ! Come on . Hurry . Andrea ! Andrea ! Get out of there ! Go outside ! Please ! You have to try ! Go outside ! Lo ! Enrique . You were right , you still need me . Where 's Julia ? Via Layetana 54 ... hope . Are you okay ? You sure ? I 'm fine . It 's nothing , don ' ! worry . Let 's go . Before the building collapses . What the hell happened here ? Someone broke through to get to the sewers . Are we close to Julia ? Don ' ! know . Let 's go " P ... Hello ? Hello ? No fucking way . What is it ? What 's wrong ? Layetana 54 . That 's where Julia is , right ? We made it . The tunnel is blocked . How the fuck will we get over there ? Where are you going ? To find Julia . Julia ... Julia ! Julia ! Julia ! Julia ! Julia ! Over here ! Julia ! Julia ! My love ! Saw her , Enrique ! Saw her . Enrique . Let me see . Okay . Don 't worry . You 'll be just fine . - We need to stop the bleeding . - Marc . Press here . Press hard . I 'll go get something to ... Marc . Stop . Forget it . No . No , don ' ! do this to me . can stop it . Enough . There 's no stopping this . Listen carefully , because this is what you 're going to do . You 're going to stop whining , you 're going to walk out that door and you 're going to cross that fucking street . Don ' ! know if can . Of course you can ! You have people waiting on the other side . This is not the end , Marc . Not for you . Hey. stop that ! It 's nothing to get worked up over . It 's better than having a heart attack at home watching TV . At least , you 're here to notice . Who would have thought a year ago that something interesting would finally happen to us . My love . Push ! You 're almost there . Push ! Enric ! Enric ! Come up .

 I think it 's our tradition . It comes out of a particularly painful part of our history . Yes , yes . But it 's been the way we 've been able to heal . At first , it was a reminder of the rebellion . - It was a price the districts had to pay . - Yes . But I think it has grown from that . I think it 's something that knits us all together . This is your third year as Gamemaker . What defines your personal signature ? No ! No ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You were just dreaming . It was me . I know . I know . But it 's not . It 's your first year , Prim . Your name 's only been in there once . They 're not gonna pick you . Try to go to sleep . I can 't . Just try . Just try . Mmm-hmm . Deep in the meadow Under the willow A bed of grass A soft green pillow You remember that song ? Okay . You finish it . I 've got to go . Where ? I 've just got to go . But I 'll be back . I love you I 'll still cook you . What are you gonna do with that when you kill it ? Damn you , Gale ! It 's not funny ! What are you gonna do with a 100-pound deer , Catnip ? It 's Reaping Day . The place is crawling with Peacekeepers . I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers . Of course you were . Like you don 't sell to Peacekeepers . No . Not today . It was the first deer I 've seen in a year . Now I have nothing . Okay . What if they did ? Just one year . What if everyone just stopped watching ? - They won 't , Gale . - What if they did ? What if we did ? Won 't happen . You root for your favorites . You cry when they get killed . - It 's sick . - Gale . If no one watches , then they don 't have a game . It 's as simple as that . - What ? - Nothing . - Fine . Laugh at me . - I 'm not laughing at you . We could do it , you know ? Take off , live in the woods . It 's what we do anyway . They 'd catch us . Well , maybe not . Cut out our tongues , or worse . We wouldn 't make it five miles . No , I 'd get five miles . I 'd go that way . I have Prim , and you have your brothers . They can come , too . Prim in the woods ? Or maybe not . I 'm never having kids . I might , if I didn 't live here . - But you do live here . - I know , but if I didn 't . Oh , I forgot . Here . Oh , my God ! Is this real ? Yeah . Better be . Cost me a squirrel . Happy Hunger Games . " And may the odds be ever in your favor . " How many times is your name in today ? Forty-two . Guess the odds aren 't exactly in my favor . - Thank you , girl . - Mmm-hmm . What 's this ? That 's a Mockingjay . How much ? - You keep it . It 's yours . - Thank you . Mom . Aw , look at you ! You look beautiful . But you better tuck in that tail , little duck . I laid something out for you , too . Okay . Now you look beautiful , too . Wish I looked like you . Oh , no . I wish I looked like you , little duck . Hey . You want to see what I got you today ? It 's a Mockingjay pin . To protect you . And as long as you have it , nothing bad will happen to you . Okay ? I promise . Shh . Shh . Prim , it 's okay . It 's okay . Shh . Okay . It 's time to sign in now . Okay ? They 're gonna prick your finger just to take a little bit of blood . - You didn 't say ... - I know . It doesn 't hurt much . Just a little . Okay ? Go sit down there with the little kids . I 'll find you after . Okay ? Next . Next . Go ahead . Next . Next . Next . Next . It 's okay . Welcome ! Welcome , welcome . Happy Hunger Games . And may the odds be ever in your favor . Now , before we begin , we have a very special film . Brought to you all the way from The Capitol . War . Terrible war . War . Terrible war . Widows , orphans , a motherless child . This was the uprising that rocked our land . Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them , loved them , protected them . Brother turned on brother until nothing remained . And then came the peace , hard fought , sorely won . A people rose up from the ashes , and a new era was born . But freedom has a cost . And the traitors were defeated . We swore as a nation we would never know this treason again . And so it was decreed that each year the various districts of Panem would offer up , in tribute , one young man and woman to fight to the death in a pageant of honor , courage , and sacrifice . The lone victor , bathed in riches , would serve as a reminder of our generosity and our forgiveness . This is how we remember our past . This is how we safeguard our future . I just love that ! Now , the time has come for us to select one courageous young man and woman for the honor of representing District 12 in the 74th Annual Hunger Games . As usual , ladies first . Primrose Everdeen . Where are you , dear ? Come on up . Well , come on up . Prim ! Prim ! No . No ! I volunteer ! I volunteer ! I volunteer as Tribute ! I believe we have a volunteer , Mr. Mayor . Prim , you need to get out of here . You need to get out of here . - No ! No ! - Go find Mom ! - Prim , go find Mom right now . I 'm so sorry . - No ! - Go find Mom . Prim , leave ! Go find Mom . - No ! No ! No ! - No ! No ! No ! - Come on . A dramatic turn of events here in District 12 . Yes , well . District 12 's very first volunteer . Bring her up . Come on , dear . What 's your name ? Katniss Everdeen . Well , I bet my hat that was your sister , wasn 't it ? Yes . Let 's have a big hand for our very first volunteer , Katniss Everdeen . And now for the boys . Peeta Mellark . Here we are . Our Tributes from District 12 . Well , go on , you two , shake hands . Happy Hunger Games . And may the odds be ever in your favor . You have three minutes . It 's okay . Prim . Prim . It 's okay . Prim , I don 't have much time . Prim . Listen . You 're gonna be okay . Don 't take any extra food from them . It isn 't worth putting your name in more times . Okay ? Listen , Prim . Gale will bring you game . You can sell cheese from your goat . Just try to win . Maybe you can . Of course . And maybe I can . I am smart , you know ? - And you can hunt . - Exactly . To protect you . Thank you . You can 't tune out again . - I won 't . - No , you can 't . Not like when Dad died . I won 't be there anymore . You 're all she has . No matter what you feel , you have to be there for her . Do you understand ? Don 't cry . Don 't cry . Don 't . Don 't . - It 's time . - Prim , it 's okay . - Prim , it 's okay . It 's okay , Prim . - No ! No ! No ! I promise , Prim . - I 'm fine . - Yeah , I know . I am . Listen to me . You 're stronger than they are . You are . - Get to a bow . - They may not have ... They will if you show them how good you are . They just want a good show . That 's all they want . If they don 't have a bow , then you make one , okay ? You know how to hunt . Animals . It 's no different , Katniss . There 's 24 of us , Gale . Only one comes out . Yeah . And it 's gonna be you . Okay . Take care of them , Gale . Whatever you do , don 't let them starve . - Let 's go . - I 'll see you soon , okay ? You two are in for a treat . Crystal chandeliers , platinum doorknobs , and it flies . We 'll be at The Capitol in less than two days . Now , before you do anything else ... 200 miles per hour , and you can barely feel a thing . I think it 's one of the wonderful things about this opportunity , that even though you 're here and even though it 's just for a little while , you get to enjoy all of this . I 'm going to find Haymitch . He 's probably in the bar car . Have you ever met him ? Haymitch ? You know , Katniss , he is our mentor . He did win this thing once . Look , you know , if you don 't want to talk , I understand , but I just don 't think there 's anything wrong with getting a little bit of help . Congratulations . Where 's the ice ? I don 't know . May I ? Okay , so ... So when do we start ? Whoa . So eager . Most of you aren 't in such a hurry . Yeah . I wanna know what the plan is . You 're our mentor . - You 're supposed to go ... - Mentor ? Yeah , our mentor . You 're supposed to tell us how to get sponsors and give us advice . Oh . Okay . Um ... Embrace the probability of your imminent death . And know , in your heart , that there 's nothing I can do to save you . So why are you here then ? The refreshments . Okay , I think that 's enough of that . You made me spill my drink . These are brand new pants . You know , I think I 'll go finish this in my room . He 's gonna come around . It 's no use . I 'm gonna go talk to him . We have two very fit 16-year-olds . Of course , of course . They always provide pretty good opponents . Yes , yes , they do . - Do you remember this year ? - Of course . One of my favorite years . And one of my favorite Arenas . The use of the rubble in the ruined city ... Very exciting And this moment here , this moment is a moment that you never forget . Yes . The moment when a Tribute becomes a victor . - You 'd freeze to death first . - No , because I 'd light a fire . That 's a good way to get killed . What 's a good way to get killed ? Oh , joy . Why don 't you join us ? I was just giving some life-saving advice . Like what ? I was just asking about how to find shelter . Which would come in handy if , in fact , you were still alive . How do you find shelter ? Pass the jam . How do you find shelter ? Give me a chance to wake up , sweetheart . This mentoring is very taxing stuff . Can you pass the marmalade ? That is mahogany ! Look at you . Just killed a placemat . You really want to know how to stay alive ? You get people to like you . Oh . Not what you were expecting ? Well , when you 're in the middle of The Games and you 're starving or freezing , some water , a knife , or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death . And those things only come from sponsors . And to get sponsors , you have to make people like you . And right now , sweetheart , you 're not off to a real good start . There it is . It 's huge ! That 's incredible . Peeta , I love you . Come on . Come on . You better keep this knife . He knows what he 's doing . So now that you 've seen them , what do you think about this year 's crop of recruits ? Are there any surprises that we can expect this year ? It 's really hard to tell just from a Reaping , - but I think this is a very interesting mix . - Yes . And whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district , that 's something you can 't ignore . What 's that ? What 's that ? We 're just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna . That was one of the bravest things I 've ever seen . With your sister ? - My name 's Cinna . - Katniss . I 'm sorry that this happened to you , and I 'm here to help you in any way that I can . Most people just congratulate me . Well , I don 't see the point in that . So tonight , they have the Tribute Parade . I 'm gonna take you out and show you off to the world . So you 're here to make me look pretty ? I 'm here to help you make an impression . Now , usually they dress people in the clothes from their district . - Yeah , we 're always coalminers . - Yeah , but I don 't wanna do that . I wanna do something that they 're gonna remember . Did they explain about trying to get sponsors ? Yeah , but I 'm not very good at making friends . We 'll see . I just think somebody that brave shouldn 't be dressed up in some stupid costume , now should they ? I hope not . Okay , this is safe . I promise . It 's not real fire . These suits are built so you won 't feel a thing . Looks pretty real to me . Well , that 's the idea . You ready ? - Don 't be afraid . - I 'm not afraid . Over 100,000 people craning to get a glimpse of this year 's Tributes . And the sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time . The importance of this moment cannot be overstated . Very nice . First chariot on my count , in 15 , 14 , 13 ... There they are . There they are . This year 's Tributes . It 's the most exciting part . It just gives you goose bumps . And don 't you love how the stylists , they so clearly are able to reflect the character of each district ? - Right . Right . There 's District 4 . - Yes . - Fishing . - I get it . - I like it . - That 's very good . And behind them , we have two power plant workers . Right ? And then ... What is that in the background ? Come on . They 'll love it . Yeah ! Now see that ? I love that . Two young people holding their hands up , saying , " I 'm proud I come from District 12 . We will not be overlooked . " - Nope . - I love that ! People are sure gonna be paying attention to them right now . And we 're ready . President Snow , you 're live . Welcome . Welcome . Tributes , we welcome you . We salute your courage and your sacrifice . And we wish you Happy Hunger Games . And may the odds be ever in your favor . That was amazing . We are all anybody 's going to be talking about . So brave . Are you sure you should be near an open flame ? Fake flame ? Are you sure you ... Let 's go upstairs . So , each of the districts get their own floor . And because you 're from 12 , you get the penthouse . Come on . So this is the living room . I know , I know . Now , your rooms are right over here . Why don 't you go clean yourselves up a little before dinner ? In two weeks , 23 of you will be dead . One of you will be alive . Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days , particularly to what I 'm about to say . First , no fighting with the other Tributes . You 'll have plenty of time for that in the Arena . There are four compulsory exercises . The rest will be individual training . My advice is don 't ignore the survival skills . Everybody wants to grab a sword , but most of you will die from natural causes . 10 % from infection , 20 % from dehydration . Exposure can kill as easily as a knife . - Jason , where 's my knife , huh ? - I didn 't touch your knife . - I put my knife right there ! - Don 't touch me . I didn 't touch your knife ! - Yes , you took my knife ! - I didn 't touch your knife ! - You took my knife , you liar ! - I didn 't touch your knife . - You liar ! - I didn 't touch your knife ! You little punk ! He took my knife ! - Get off me ! - I 'm just sitting here . I 'll finish you right now , kid ! Actually , better yet , I 'll wait for the Arena . You 're the first one I get , so watch your back . - Everybody , back in line ! - You know who you 're messing with , kid ! He 's a Career . You know what that is ? - From District 1 . - And 2 . They train in a special academy until they 're 18 . Then they volunteer . By that point , they 're pretty lethal . But they don 't receive any special treatment . In fact , they stay in the exact same apartment as you do . And I don 't think they let them have dessert . And you can . So how good are they ? Obviously they 're pretty good . They win it almost every year , but ... Almost . ... they can be arrogant . And arrogance can be a big problem . I hear you can shoot . I 'm all right . No , she 's better than all right . My father buys her squirrels . He says she hits them right in the eye every time . - Peeta 's strong . - What ? He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour right over his head . I 've seen it . Okay , well , I 'm not gonna kill anybody with a sack of flour . No , but you might have a better chance of winning if somebody comes after you with a knife . I have no chance of winning ! None ! All right ? It 's true . Everybody knows it . You know what my mother said ? She said District 12 might finally have a winner . But she wasn 't talking about me . She was talking about you . I 'm not very hungry . I 'm done , too . Throw that metal thing over there . What ? No . Haymitch said we 're not supposed to show our skills . I don 't care what Haymitch said . Those guys are looking at you like you 're a meal . Throw it . Hi . Hey . How did you do that ? I used to decorate the cakes down at the bakery . - Oh . - I 'll show you . See ? - Wow . - Yeah . Hey , I think you have a shadow . Tomorrow , they 'll bring you in one by one and evaluate you . This is important , because higher ratings will mean sponsors . This is the time to show them everything . There 'll be a bow . Make sure you use it . Peeta , you make sure to show your strength . They 'll start with District 1 , so the two of you will go last . I don 't know how else to put this . Make sure they remember you . Katniss Everdeen . Hey , Katniss ? Shoot straight . Katniss Everdeen . District 12 . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , who ordered this pig ? Who ordered this pig ? Hey ! Did you get some pig yet ? Thank you for your consideration . - Are you crazy ? - I just got mad . Mad ? You realize that your actions reflect badly on all of us . Not just you . They just want a good show . It 's fine . How about it 's just bad manners , Cinna ! How about that ? Well , finally ! I hope you noticed we have a serious situation . Nice shooting , sweetheart . What did they do when you shot the apple ? Well , they looked pretty startled . Oh , yeah . Now , what did you say ? " Thanks for ... " - Thanks for your consideration . - " ... your consideration . " Genius ! Genius . I don 't think we 're gonna find this funny if the Gamemakers decide to take it out ... On who ? On her ? On him ? I think they already have . Loosen your corset , have a drink . I would have given anything to see it . As you know , the Tributes were rated on a scale of 1 to 12 after three days of careful evaluation . The Gamekeepers would like to acknowledge that it was an exceptional ... From District 1 , Marvel , with a score of nine . From District 2 , Cato , with a score of 10 . Clove , with a score of 10 . From District 3 ... From District 4 , with a score of ... From District 7 ... From District 8 ... And Rue with a score of seven . Now our final district . From District 12 . Peeta Mellark . A score of eight . - Excellent . - Peeta ! Bravo . - We can work with that . - Good job . And finally , from District 12 , Katniss Everdeen . With a score of ... Eleven . - Katniss ! - Outstanding ! - Yes ! - Eleven ? Congratulations . I thought they hated me . They must have liked your guts . To Katniss Everdeen , The Girl on Fire ! Goodness . We are . An 11 ? She earned it . She shot an arrow at your head . Well , at an apple . Near your head . Sit down . Seneca , why do you think we have a winner ? What do you mean ? I mean , why do we have a winner ? I mean , if we just wanted to intimidate the districts , why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once ? Be a lot faster . Hope . Hope ? Hope . It is the only thing stronger than fear . A little hope is effective . A lot of hope is dangerous . A spark is fine , as long as it 's contained . So ... So contain it . Right . So she 's staring at all my jewels She cannot take her eyes off of them . Well , look at all that that you 're wearing . Frankly , it was rude . Oh ! Haymitch , you should join us . We 're having some of your favorite for dinner . Oh , lovely . - Where 's Peeta ? - He 's in his room . Now , listen , tomorrow 's the last day . And they let us work with our own Tributes right before The Games , so you and I will be going down at 9 : 00 . What about him ? He says he wants to be trained on his own from now on . What ? This kind of thing does happen at this point . There 's only one winner , right ? We should have some chocolate-covered strawberries . - Oh , my , yes . - Please . Ladies and gentlemen your master of ceremonies , Caesar Flickerman ! Thank you ! Thank you ! Welcome , welcome , welcome to the 74th Annual Hunger Games ! Now , in about five minutes , they 're all going to be out here . All of the Tributes that you 've heard about . Are you excited ? Let me hear it ! Amazing . I don 't feel amazing . Don 't you know how beautiful you look ? No . And I don 't know how to make people like me . - How do you make people like you ? - Well , you made me like you . That 's different . I wasn 't trying . Exactly . Just be yourself , I 'll be there the whole time . And just pretend that you 're talking to me . Okay ? Okay . Let 's see if she does indeed shine . Let 's have a warm round of applause for Glimmer ! Glimmer , are you prepared ? Yes , Caesar , I am very prepared . I like it . That 's assurance . That 's self-assurance . - Don 't you think ? - And , as you can see I 'm wearing one of our own creations . A big round of applause ! Marvel ! Whoo ! Welcome , Clove . - It 's an honor representing my district . - You 're a fighter . I 'm prepared . I 'm vicious . I 'm ready to go . Cato ! I find that if I can apply myself to the situation present , I will be able to figure it out . Thank you . Lovely to see you . Thank you so much . Good . So you can climb trees . You 're pretty quick . And are you a hunter ? A gatherer ? From District 12 , District 12 ... You know her as The Girl on Fire ! Well , we know her as the lovely Katniss Everdeen ! Welcome ! Welcome . Welcome . Well , that was quite an entrance you made the other day . What ? I think someone 's a little nervous . I said that was quite an entrance that you made at the Tribute Parade the other day . Do you want to tell us about it ? Well , I was just hoping that I wouldn 't burn to death . When you came out of that chariot , I have to say , my heart stopped . Did any of you experience this as well ? My heart stopped . So did mine . Now , tell me about the flames . Are they real ? Yes . In fact , I 'm wearing them today . Would you like to see ? Wait , wait , wait . Is it safe ? Yes . What do you think , folks ? Yeah ! I think that 's a yes . Steady . Steady . Lovely . Thank you . That was really something . Katniss , that was something . That was something . Thank you for that . I have one more question for you . It 's about your sister . We were all very moved , I think , when you volunteered for her at the Reaping . Did she come and say goodbye to you ? Yes . - She did . - She did . And what did you say to her in the end ? I told her that I would try to win . That I would try to win for her . Of course you did . And try you will . Ladies and gentlemen , from District 12 , Katniss Everdeen , The Girl on Fire ! You did it , darling . That was incredible . Thank you . Nice job , sweetheart . Thank you . Nice dress , too . - Not yours . - Please welcome Peeta Mellark ! Peeta , welcome . How are you finding The Capitol ? And don 't say , " With a map . " It 's different . It 's very different than back home . Different . In what way ? Give us an example . Okay . Well , the showers here are weird . - The showers ? - Yes . We have different showers . I have a question for you , Caesar . Do I smell like roses to you ? - Take a whiff ? - All right . - You see ? - Yes . Do I smell like it ? - You definitely smell better than I do . - Well , I 've lived here longer . That makes sense . Very funny . So , Peeta , tell me , is there a special girl back home ? No . No . Not really . No ? I don 't believe it for a second . Look at that face . Handsome man like you . Peeta , tell me . Well , there ... There is this one girl that I 've had a crush on forever . But I don 't think she actually recognized me until the Reaping . Well , I 'll tell you what , Peeta . You go out there and you win this thing , and when you get home , she 'll have to go out with you . Right , folks ? Thanks , but I don 't think winning 's gonna help me at all . And why not ? Because she came here with me . Well , that 's bad luck . Yeah , it is . - And I wish you all the best of luck . - Thank you . Peeta Mellark . District 12 ! What the hell was that ? You don 't talk to me , and then you say you have a crush on me ? You say you want to train alone ? Is that how you want to play ? Stop it ! Stop it ! - Let 's start right now ! - Hey ! - He did you a favor . - He made me look weak . He made you look desirable , which in your case , can 't hurt , sweetheart . He 's right , Katniss . Of course I 'm right . Now , I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12 ... We are not star-crossed lovers . It 's a television show ! And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors , which could save your damn life . Okay . Why don 't you get out of here ? Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow . Manners ! You , too ? Hey . Can 't sleep ? No . Of course not . I 'm sorry I went after you . You know , I meant that as a compliment . I know . Listen to them . Yeah . I just don 't want them to change me . How would they change you ? I don 't know . They 'd turn me into something I 'm not . I just don 't want to be another piece in their game , you know ? You mean you won 't kill anyone ? No . I mean , I 'm sure I would , just like anybody else when the time came , but I just keep wishing that I could think of a way to show them that they don 't own me . If I 'm gonna die , I want to still be me . Does that make any sense ? Yeah . I just can 't afford to think like that . I have my sister . Yeah , I know . I guess I 'll see you tomorrow . See you tomorrow . They 'll put all kinds of stuff right in front , right in the mouth of the Cornucopia . There 'll even be a bow there . Don 't go for it . Why not ? It 's a bloodbath . They 're trying to pull you in . That 's not your game . You turn , run , find high ground , look for water . Water 's your new best friend . Don 't step off that pedestal early or they 'll blow you sky high . I won 't . Katniss , you can do this . Thanks . Give me your arm . Give me your arm . - Give me your arm . - What is that ? Your tracker . We 're up . We 're up ! All right . Less than a minute , people . Final checks . There are 15 out . They are flying . Here . Shh . Thank you . Thirty seconds . I 'm not allowed to bet , but if I could , I 'd bet on you . Twenty seconds . Ten seconds . Okay , they 're in the tubes . 50 , 49 , 48 , 47 , 46 , 45 , 44 , 43 , 42 , 41 , 40 , 39 , 38 , 37 , 36 , 35 , 34 , 33 , 32 , 31 , 30 , 29 , 28 , 27 , 26 , 25 , 24 , 23 , 22 ... And , of course , there 's the familiar " boom " of the cannon , which marks the end of another fallen Tribute . ... eight nine 10 11 12 . Twenty-five ? Got it . He 's moving now . Well , that makes 13 gone in the first eight hours . And Claudius , I think I see an alliance forming . Wait ! Did you see the look on her face ? - How stupid can you get ? - A fire ? " Oh , no ! Please don 't kill me ! Oh , no ! " That 's actually a good impression . Hey , lover boy ! - You sure she went this way ? - Yeah , I 'm sure . You better be . Yeah , that was her snare we found back there . Are you sure we shouldn 't just kill him now ? Nah . He 's our best chance of finding her . Let 's go . Sir ? She is almost at the edge . Two kilometers away from the nearest Tribute . Let 's turn her around . Cueing another . On my count . One , two ... She 's heading towards the left flank . Okay . Can you give me a tree right there ? Sure . Cueing tree . She 's almost there . Lucia , get a cannon ready . There she is ! There she is ! - She 's mine ! - Not if I get her first ! - Where you gonna go ? - Mine ! Fish out of the pond ! And someone found her . - There she is ! - Yeah ! Here we go ! - Where you going , huh ? - Get her , Cato ! Where do you think you 're going ? Where you going , baby ? Three o 'clock . - Where you going , Girl on Fire ? - We got her ! Miss Everdeen , I 'm gonna get you ! That 's not gonna help you up there , Katniss . Where are you going ? - Go get her , man ! - You are so done . Just get her , Cato ! - He 's gonna get you , Katniss . - Look at her scurry . Right up there . - Kill her ! - Just go , keep going ! - Go , Cato . - Come on , Cato . - She 's right there . - Go , Cato ! Come on , Cato ! You got this . Go ! He 's got this . - Kill her , Cato ! Just get her , Cato ! - Go ! Go ! - Take her down ! - Go ! Go ! - You got this , Cato ! - Come on , kill her ! I 'm coming for you ! Come on , Cato ! I 'll do it myself . Give me that before ... - Get her . - Come on . Come on , come on ! Maybe you should throw the sword ! Let 's just wait her out . She 's gotta come down at some point . It 's that or starve to death . We 'll just kill her then . Okay . Somebody make a fire . - Let 's make camp over here ! - Hurry up with the fire . Boys . Thank you . Psst . Psst . Claudius , I think those are tracker jackers Am I wrong ? Oh . - Those things are very lethal . - Very . For those of you who don 't know , tracker jackers are genetically engineered wasps whose venom causes searing pain , powerful hallucinations , and in extreme cases , death . Run . Run ! Run ! Katniss , go ! Get out of here ! Go ! What are you doing ? Go ! Not only is it lethal , but the venom of a tracker jacker sting can produce powerful hallucinations . Mom , don 't just sit there and look at me ! Please say something ! Katniss , go ! Get out of here ! Go ! What are you doing ? Go ! Rue ? It 's okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you . You want mine , too ? No , that 's okay . Here . Thanks . How long was I asleep ? Couple of days . I changed your leaves twice . Thank you . So what happened while I was out ? The girl from 1 and the boy from 10 . And the boy from my district ? Yeah , he 's okay . I think he 's down by the river . Is all of that true ? What ? You and him ? So where are Cato and the others ? They got all their supplies down by the lake . It 's piled up in this great big pyramid . That sounds tempting . Now , this green stuff is gonna smoke like crazy , so as soon as you light it , move on to the next fire . Light this one last , and I 'll meet you back over there . Right . And then I 'll destroy their stuff while they 're chasing us . We need a signal in case one of us gets held up . Okay . Like what ? Here . Watch this . Mockingjays . That 's great . Back home , we use them to signal all the time . You try . Okay , so if we hear that , it means we 're okay and we 'll be back real soon . We 're gonna be okay . Hey , I 'll see you for supper . - Okay . - Okay . Guys . Guys , look ! Over here . Come on , come on . Look ! Let 's go . You stay guard and don 't move until we can get back . I want to see if she 's gonna figure out this booby trap . Yes . It seems they 've reburied their mines around that big pile of goodies . She 's certainly figured it out , hasn 't she ? I don 't know what happened . - What the hell happened ? - I don 't know ! Our stuff ! Katniss ! Katniss ! Katniss , help ! Katniss ! Katniss ! Help ! Katniss ! Katniss ! It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're fine . See ? It 's okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . Did you blow up the food ? Every bit of it . Good . You have to win . Can you sing ? Okay . Deep in the meadow Under the willows A bed of grass A soft green pillow Lay down your head and close your eyes And when they open , the sun ... I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Don 't kill her . You 'll just create a martyr . Well , it seems we 've already got one . I hear these rumors out of District 11 . This could get away from you . What do you want ? You have a lot of anger out there . I know you know how to handle a mob . You 've done it before . If you can 't scare them , give them something to root for . Such as ? Young love . So you like an underdog ? Everyone likes an underdog . I don 't . Have you been out there ? 10 ? 11 ? 12 ? Not personally . No . Well , I have . There are lots of underdogs . Lots of coal , too . Grow crops , minerals , things we need . There are lots of underdogs . And I think if you could see them , you would not root for them either . I like you . Be careful . Attention , Tributes . Attention . The regulations requiring a single victor have been suspended . From now on , two victors may be crowned , if both originate from the same district . This will be the only announcement . Peeta . Oh , my God ! Peeta ! Peeta ! Hi . It 's okay . What was it ? A sword . It 's bad , huh ? It 's gonna be fine . Ah ! Katniss . - Katniss . - No ! I 'm not gonna leave you . I 'm not gonna do that . Why not ? Nobody 's gonna find you in here . They already found me . We 'll just get you some medicine . Katniss , I don 't get many parachutes . We 'll figure something out . Like what ? Something . - Medicine ? - No . Soup . I 'll do it . That 's nice . You fed me once . I think about that all the time . How I tossed you that bread . - Peeta ... - I should have gone to you . I should have just gone out in the rain and ... You feel hot . I remember the first time I saw you . Your hair was in two braids instead of one . And I remember when you sang in the music assembly . The teacher said , " Who knows The Valley Song ? " And your hand shot straight up . Stop . After that , I watched you going home every day . Every day - Well , say something . I 'm not good at saying something . Then come here . Please . - Even if I don 't make it ... - Shh . Stop it . Attention , Tributes . Attention . Commencing at sunrise , there will be a feast tomorrow at the Cornucopia . This will be no ordinary occasion . Each of you needs something desperately . And we plan to be generous hosts . Your medicine . You 're not going alone . Yeah ? You need it , and you can 't walk . Katniss , you 're not gonna risk your life for me . I 'm not gonna let you . You would do it for me . Wouldn 't you ? Why are you doing this ? Now there 's no way I 'm letting you go . Peeta ... Please . Stay . Okay . I 'll stay . Oh , God ! Where 's lover boy ? Oh , I see . You were gonna help him , right ? Well , that 's sweet . You know , it 's too bad that you couldn 't help your little friend . That little girl ? What was her name again ? Rue ? Yeah , well , we killed her . And now we 're gonna kill you . You kill her ? - No ! - I heard you ! - Cato ! Cato ! - You said her name ! You said her name ! Just this time , 12 . For Rue . Peeta , I got it . I got the medicine . - What happened to you ? - I 'm fine . No , you 're not . What happened ? The girl from 2 , she threw a knife . I 'm okay . You shouldn 't have gone . You said you weren 't gonna go . You got worse . I 'm sorry . You need some of that , too . I 'm okay . That feels better . Okay . Now you . - I 'm okay . - No , come on , you need it , too . Come on . All right . Hi . Oh . You 're so much better . Oh , my God , Peeta . I hardly feel anything . We could go home . We could . We 're the only team left . We could go home . We know Thresh took off . Cato 's gonna be by the Cornucopia . He 's not gonna go someplace he doesn 't know . Foxface , she could be anywhere . We should probably hunt around here . We don 't have any food left . Okay , I 'll take the bow . I 'm just kidding . I 'll go pick some stuff . Peeta ? Peeta ? Peeta ! Peeta ! Are you okay ? - I heard the cannon . I thought ... - No . That 's Nightlock , Peeta ! You 'd be dead in a minute ! I didn 't know . You scared me to death . Damn you . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I never even knew she was following me . She 's clever . Too clever . - What are you doing ? - Maybe Cato likes berries , too . What time is it ? A little after noon . Why is it getting so dark ? Must be in a hurry to end it . - You ready , Lucia ? - Right here , sir . Well , that 's great . - Now can you put that in the middle ? - Sure . That 's it . That 's excellent . Did you hear that ? What was that ? It 's the finale . Let 's go . Go . Katniss ! Here ! Go on . Shoot . Then we both go down and you 'd win . Go on . I 'm dead anyway . I always was , right ? I didn 't know that till now . How is that ? Is that what they want ? Huh ? - No . - No , no . I could still do this . I could still do this . One more kill . It 's the only thing I know how to do . Bring pride to my district . Not that it matters . Please ! No ! Please ! Attention . Attention , Tributes . There has been a slight rule change . The previous revision , allowing for two victors from the same district , has been revoked . Only one victor may be crowned . Good luck . And may the odds be ever in your favor . Go ahead . One of us should go home . One of us has to die . They have to have their victor . No . They don 't . Why should they ? - No ! - Trust me . Trust me . Together ? Together . Okay . One ... Two ... Three . Stop ! Stop ! Ladies and gentlemen , may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games . They 're not happy with you . Why ? Because I didn 't die ? Because you showed them up . Well , I 'm sorry it didn 't go the way they planned . - I 'm not very happy with them either . - Katniss ! This is serious . Not just for you . They don 't take these things lightly . When they ask , you say you couldn 't help yourself . You were so in love with this boy that the thought of not being with him was unthinkable . You 'd rather die than not be with him . You understand ? How did you feel when you found him by that river ? I felt like the happiest person in the world . I couldn 't imagine life without him . Oh . And what about you , Peeta ? She saved my life . We saved each other . Ladies and gentlemen , the star-crossed lovers from District 12 , this year 's victors of the 74th Annual Hunger Games ! Congratulations . Thank you . What a lovely pin . Thank you . It 's from my district . They must be very proud of you . So what happens when we get back ? I don 't know . I guess we try to forget . I don 't want to forget .

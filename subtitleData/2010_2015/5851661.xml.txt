 AGE OF TOMORROW No , I didn 't leave Lindsey home by herself . No , the dog is there . Sue , come on , don 't you think you 're overreacting here ? Lindsey is almost 17 , I think she 'll be fine . I know it 's my weekend with her . Look I 'll make it up to her okay ? Hello ? Sue ? Damn it ! Hi , you 've reached Lindsey Meyers phone . If you 're important , please leave a message , unless you 're Jerry , then you can go fuck yourself . Thanks . Hi Linds , it 's dad . Please change your voice-mail . Anyway look . I want to make it up to you for working today . So why don 't we go to the movies tonight ? I 'll see if I can get off early , okay ? Oh , and please remember to feed the dog . And why don 't you just stay home tonight ? The last time you went out , your phone battery died long enough for you to come home stumbling drunk . Next time your mum 's gonna kill me . Okay , gotta go . I love you . Bye . Want to tell me what 's so important you couldn 't tell me over the phone ? Last night 's meteor shower caused a lot of damage all over the country . Nothing we can 't handle . - But Colonel . - But what ? We 've got bigger problems . General Magowan . How bad is the situation ? Mac , the president is so concerned , my phone 's been ringing off the hook . The Pentagon is running scenarios . Their expert , some physicist , is coming in any minute . I told you my name is Dr. Gordon . I need to speak with the General right away . Ahh Dr. Gordon . Make it through security okay ? Yes , you can go , soldiers . I 'm sorry I 'm late . Gentlemen , for the last 10 years I have been liaison between NASA and the US military . Keeping them appraised of all potential near earth objects . And by the look of this , we 've got a big one headed right for us . Oh my God , how big is it ? Well , with all due respect , sir , if this was the size of a satellite , I wouldn 't be here . This is a quarter of our moon . We are talking end of days here . End of life as we know it . - And judging by its speed , I 'd say ... - We are looking at a 48 hour window before it collides with earth , Mac . - Get the Colonel a cup of coffee . - Yes , right away , sir . - Get the gravity of the situation ? - Yes , sir . I need to keep monitoring this thing . I will keep you informed . Good . Mac , you 've trained the best . Now we need the best . We need to fly some of our own onto that rock and blast it out of earth 's path . We have a Captain James Wheeler coming in . Are you familiar with this mission ? Sir , he 's a liability . He lost a man on his last mission . Well , I 'll let you decide that once he arrives . Right now , we need to issue a nation wide alert . Start moving people into bunkers and bomb shelters . - God help us . - Yes . It had to happen on my day off , huh ? I 'm sorry , Chris . Five guys didn 't come in today . Not even a call . - Oh ! - Man . The meteor shower did really a number on us , we got fires popping up all over the city . I want hoses in those windows up there now ! Come on ! Come on ! - Anybody left inside ? - No , LAPD said everybody made it out . I don 't think so . - Ready , kid ? - Yeah , how about you , pop ? Let 's bring the heat . - Got it ? - Oh man , we gonna need backup . - There 's no backup , it 's just us . - Great . Come on , pal ! We 're running out of time ! Let 's go ! I heard those screams , she 's up here . LA Fire Department . Is anybody in here ? They are clear . Jesus , it 's coming down on us , Chris . We got to find this lady and get the hell out of here . I know . I know ! Is anybody in here ? There 's a room . Clear . - Where is she ? - She 's not here . Going up . Come on , it 's coming from up here . Let 's go . There ... there she is ! Stay where you are , we 're coming to get you . Sully ! - You okay ? - I don 't know , I think it 's broken . - Yup , yeah , it 's broken . - We gotta get you out of here . Come on . Well , what are you gonna do ? Go after her by yourself ? Come on ! Go ! What you gonna do ? Stop me ? Come on . Let 's go ! You 're gonna be okay . Come on . We are almost there ... almost there . Come on , get him . His leg 's broken . - I 'm going back in . - What ? Chris ! Chris , what are you doing ? Come on ! Is he crazy ? That roof top 's going to give way . - And what 's taking so long ? - Come on , Chris . Come on . Well , I think I got him . Look ! - Jesus Christ , Chris what are you doing ? - The elevator was broken . - How 's your leg . - It 's been better . Glad we didn 't take the short way down . Excuse me , General ... Colonel . Captain Wheeler , thank you for coming . Do you know Colonel McCanless ? Only by reputation . I heard he was the best pilot in the Air Force . We 're glad you decided to come in on such short notice . Well , I don 't think I had much of a choice . Your goons are very pushy . But at least now I can make myself clear . Whatever it is , it 's no . - I 'm done . - Done ? Then how come you 're still wearing those tags , Captain . - I said I 'm done . - He is very reassuring . How much longer are you gonna torture yourself ? It 's been two years . You lost one man , and saved several others . It doesn 't mean anything . Now there 's nothing I can do to change it . How about saving lives of billions ? Why exactly am I here ? The meteor shower that 's been sweeping the world . Right now , going the path of a mass of asteroid heading for Earth . We 're being told from the sheer size of it , on impact , nothing will live . Do we have your attention now ? What do you want from me ? We want you to go up there , dig , plant charges and blow this thing to hell before it reaches earth . - How much time do we have ? - Impact in 46 hours . I am afraid this is a time sensitive situation . So we 're going to need an immediate response . - If I do this ... - Captain , it won 't be like before . We 're not sending you behind enemy lines . It sounds like you 're sending me to hell . Jim , please . We need you . You can watch the world burn , or you can do something to change it . My mission , my team . No exceptions . Are you sure about this man , General ? Sometimes , Colonel , you just have to act on faith . At ease . General Magowan . Sergeant Clayton , Reconnaissance . Sir . - Corporal Cabrera , Demolitions . - Sir . - Lieutenant Southard , Communications . - Sir . - Fitzpatrick and Sanchez , Pilots . - Sir . General , meet the roughnecks . - Relieved yet ? - I will be , once you get back . Captain Wheeler . Allow me to introduce Dr. Gordon . - The Pentagon 's most brilliant physicist . - Oh , I don 't know about that . Very nice to meet you , Captain Wheeler . May I introduce you to your shuttle ? The SI-22 Astraeus . The Astraeus was designed as an interceptor for satellite and base station emergencies . We filled her up for exactly one round trip , so don 't take her sightseeing in between or anything . We 've loaded the equipment and schematics as to exactly where to dig and bury the explosives . - We 're not getting weapons ? - For the asteroid ? No . But for security reasons there is a locked case with firearm . We wouldn 't want you guys getting all ... trigger-happy . Great , so we 've got tickets to the end of the world , and we don 't have any damn guns . Don 't worry , the US government will be rewarding you all handsomely . - How handsome ? - Three . - Hundred thousand ? - Million . Get this mother started , I 'm ready to go ! - Alright , let 's do this . - Suit up . - Well , I guess we 'll see you up there . - We ? Uh yeah . Unless you 've got ... someone who knows interstellar rock formations better than I do . - I mean , if you do , that 's cool . - We it is . You didn 't think I was gonna let you have all the fun , did you ? So , take her out easy . I 've just waxed her . Launch . Minus five minutes . - Think you got this ? - Oh sure . I 've got a 30-minute crash course in piloting a billion dollar government funded space shuttle . - It 's not to get . - Thought so . - Well , hold tight back there . - Take-off is in 30 seconds . Once you 're on the rock you may have difficulty with radio transmission . Well , that 's why we 've got this satellite beacon , to amplify our signal . Better stay tight . - You ready ? - You know I 'm ready . You were born ready . Jesus ! Whoo ... oooo . - They serve refreshments on this flight ? - Shut up . We made it . Not yet . Still a way to go . How 's the ride ? Okay , that can 't be good . What the hell ... What the hell is that ? Talk to me . Our planned course is incorrect . We 're on collision course with the asteroid . What ? That doesn 't make sense . Based on its speed , we knew how much to compensate for that travel time for it to be much easier . - It seems to be slowing down . - What ? If we check the distance from earth we 're faster than that - instead we 're slowing down . - Well , that can 't be good . To say the least . Oh no , everyone back in your seats . - Why ? - We 're going in too fast . This is going to be rough . Hang on ! Fire the front boosters . Oh , my God ! Come on ! - Crap yourself ? - Get real . Wow , what is this , Gonzo rock ? Watch * * * . Now you all have your coordinates . Locate your targets and mark them with a tracking rod . Got it , sir ! Clayton , you make your way cutting and drilling . Cabrera and Southard , you hustle back to the ship and prep the explosives . Stick together . Fitzpatrick and Sanchez , you 'll prep the shuttle for take-off . Read you , Captain . - The clock is ticking ! Squad move out ! - Sir , sir . Okay ! Let 's go . Don 't look at me . She 's your tourist . I 'll start here . One asteroid root canal coming up now . - That 's odd . - What is it ? I 'm drilling , but I 'm only 50 feet in . Just having a hard time getting any deeper . - That 's not deep enough . - Keep at it . Yes , sir . - Come on , get more locations marked . - It 's got a chamber . What ? There , you see that ? A cave . If there are passages , then maybe there 's a cavern that leads to this asteroid 's epicenter . We could plant the charges there , and then we won 't have to dig in order to completely destroy this thing . Squad , we 're going to scout a nearby cave as a potential detonation point . - Stay the course . - Whoa ! What ! A cave ? Just be careful , I mean , we 're only near them craters . Watch yourself , sir . - Come on , this way . - Easy , Doctor . Captain James ? What do you got ? Look ! Well , this doesn 't make sense . - Captain , come in ! - Go ahead , Southard . - There 's something out here . - What ? Cabrera and I were marking our coordinates and ... And what ? Something moved about here . I saw it went right by us . - Debris ? - Captain , where are you ? Stand by guys . What the hell is this ? This is weird . I don 't like this . I 've never seen anything like this . What 's that ? Don 't . Okay , this is not an asteroid . Everyone , back to the ship . Now ! Whoa , the whole damn thing is shaking . Hey , jump ! Come on ! Jump ! You got this . - Good jump , girl . - What the hell is going on ? I don 't know . Oh my God . Go ! What is that ? Control ! We have hundreds of bogeys about to enter Earth 's atmosphere . Say it again , I 'm afraid . Enemy aircrafts . Can you read ? Alert everyone . 30 kilometers outside of Saint-Guilhem-le-Desert , France . Jesus ... What the ... Oh my God . Fuck ! Please , not now . No ! Come on ! Come on ! No ! You think that was enough excitement for one day . Yeah , relax would you ? - Have you ever seen anything like this ? - What is that ? Station 2-4-9 , this is Hansen . Do you copy ? Are you seeing this ? - Coming in too fast there . - Halt . Look out ! - Turn off your engine . - Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey . - Turn off your engine . - I 'll call you back . What the hell is going on out here ? - This is a restricted area ! - What are you talking about ? Our department is only a block away . We have direct orders to start relocating everybody from downtown to a safe military bunker . Relocating ? Under whose authority ? That 's on a need to know basis which you don 't have to . - So get back in your truck , I 'll have my men ... Incoming ! - Captain , what 's going on ? - It 's an invasion ! What ? What the hell 's going on ? - This isn 't what we think it is . - Yeah , no kidding . We need to get the hell out of here ! Oh , God . Sanchez ... Fitzpatrick ... Hostiles . Get back ! - Alright everybody ! Into the cave ! - What ? I 'm not going in there . Cabrera , get down ! - Cabrera ! - No ! Come on ! I don 't think she 's actually dead . Come on ! - This isn 't positive . - We 're trapped . What are you doing ? - There 's got to be some way . - Take cover ! How the hell did you do that ? I think this is the same thing that happened to Cabrera . I think they 've discovered some sort of teleportation technology or wormhole or something . Earth to Wheeler ! They 're not giving up here . It 's our only way out . I 'll see you on the other side . - Where did she go ? - She 's crazy ! - Maybe not ! Go ! - What ? I was wrong , you 're crazy ! - I said go ! - Yes , sir . Let 's go , Clayton . - You guys alright ? - Ah , I think so . I 'm alright . Where are my men ? - Don 't shoot . - I 'm not going to shoot you . Whoa ssh ... That thing is coming around . Where did it go ? Ssh , get down . Shit , it 's on the truck . - What the hell were those things ? - I don 't know . I didn 't get a good enough look . They destroyed the radio and killed my men . Whatever they are , they 're patrolling , eliminating any hostile threat . - I can 't see anything . - It 's because we are under a truck . Wait , wait . Hold on . It is Lindsey . Lindsey . Dad ! I 'm so sorry . Dad , please come and get me . They came out of nowhere , and we 're trapped . Dad ? Where are you ? Are you all right ? Yeah I 'm okay , there are some other people here with me . What do you mean ? You 're not at home ? Where are you ? I 'm downtown . Dad , what 's going on ? I 'm scared . We keep hearing noises and screams , and I just ... Okay baby , I know . Listen , wherever you are , just lock yourself in tight . Don 't go anywhere near the doors or the windows , okay ? Okay . Now tell me exactly where you are . They chased us into some old office building near Union Station . Dad , what are these things ? They are dead because I 'm coming to get you . You just sit tight , okay ? - I love you , Dad . - I love you too . What 's the plan ? - Major ? - Blake . - Chris Meyer . - Nice to meet you . Okay , look . They got us surrounded , but I think they starting to leave away from our position . I think we can sneak out if we go out that way . And I could salvage any weapons I still have . What 's the plan , boss ? I 'm going to get my daughter . - His daughter is not worth it . - She 's not that cute . Dad , where are you ? No ! No ! Get away ! Let 's go . - Glad you could joined the party . - Where are we ? I thought we were history . Look at that . - We 're not in South Central . - What did I tell you ? These things have mastered technology far greater than ours . They are traveling to earth through wormholes . That 's great , but how do we get back ? Good question . It 's not like we could just call for help . Our radios are crap out here . Sure , we can . We can use this beacon to increase our signal and send an SOS . But it 's only good for one transmission . Alright , fine . Do it . It 's gonna take some time to charge . Give it an hour . Fine . Do it . Nobody leaves here without my say so , understood ? Whoa , whoa , wait , wait . What are you doing , genius ? We 're on an alien planet , you don 't even know if there is air here . Don 't worry , it 's breathable . As you are . Well , that smells good . - I miss LA . - Hey Captain ? I think you better take a look at this . I think we 're in their backyard . Son of a ... That 's not all . We 're not the only ones out here . They 're herding humans . - Doc , that absolutely needs an hour ? - Unfortunately , yes . Alright . Now we send out an SOS and just hope help will arrive ? A whole lot of waiting . Yeah , in time for those things to find us . Wait wait wait . What about all those people ? What about them ? We have to get out of here ! Ah yeah ! And go where ? Alright . Saddle up , we 're moving out . What ? Where to ? We 're going down there , we 're going to save those people . - Are you crazy , what about us ? - Stand down , Lieutenant ! Those are innocent people who need our help . The rest of you can either follow me or sit here with your thumbs up your ass . - I said saddle up ! - Yes , sir . May I bother one of you for a weapon ? Thank you . Let 's move out . Try this . The bigger they are , the harder they fall . Hey , right here . Come over here ! Yeah , over here . Over here . That 's right , come and get it ! That 's right ! Get him Mike ! That 's right ! Over here ! - I 'm glad I stayed under here . - Come on ! Deb , Deb , where is Shawn ? Where did you see him last ? He couldn 't have just disappeared . I can 't come home till they get back . There are fires all over the city . Call the police . Then try them again , Deb . Deb , baby , Deb , Deb stop crying , stop crying , we 'll find him , okay ? I promise . Okay ? Deb ? Hello ? Deb ? I hope you know where we 're going . We can 't keep running like this . Don 't worry , we 're close . Okay , come on . - Holy Mother Mary . Are you all right ? - Not exactly . - Samon , thank Christ you 're alive . - What the hell is going on out there ? Well , it 's the end of the world . Must be . I haven 't seen anybody else all day . The others took all the working engine . That one 's transmission is busted . - Well , let 's take my truck . - It 's payback time . - Whoa , whoa , whoa ... - Nice . - Whoa ! Where 's the fire ? - I 'm going after my daughter . And there are some out of towners out there . They aren 't too friendly . If I were you , I 'd arm myself . You 're serious ? Oh my God ! My family , man ! I got to get to my family . I got to see my family ! I got to ... Tim ! Come with us . Here , sorry . But if it as bad as you say it is then I need to collect my family . If the power lines are down ... I need to go , man . I ... Alright . Just stay focused . Be careful out there . - Good luck , Chris . - Take care of yourself , Tim . Chris , I can 't thank you enough . I got to get back to base . - This is war . - So give ' em hell ! Well , you drive . Sully ... - Why don 't we back seat this one . - Game on , boss . Captain , what is it ? There . Where ? What is it doing ? What 's going on ? Something 's not right . How do you know ? They 're hunting us . And that one is a decoy . They rest are going to flank us from all sides . - Orders , Captain ? - Run ! As fast as you can . Hurry , this way . - It 's gone . - Oh Jesus . My heart can 't stop pounding . It 's war . Get used to it . Hey . You okay ? - I should never have left her alone . - Hey , Chris , come on . Well , if she 's anything at all like you , she 's doing fine . She doesn 't want to be anything like me . I break every promise , I 'm never there . Don 't worry , we 're gonna find her . Hey ! Hey ! We 're gonna find her , okay ? - Guys guys , we got company ! - Oh crap ! - Come on , let 's go . Faster , faster ! - Hang on ! Lose him man ! Lose him ! - Put some lead into it ! - This thing can 't go any faster ! Oh God Chris , when you last time you got a tune-up ? - Will , get us out of here ! Now ! - Hang on , hang on . Chris , look out ! - Thanks . - Now we 're even . - Sully ! - Oh Jesus Christ , they got Sullivan ! - That thing is still following us . - Eyes on the road ! - What what ... ? - The brakes are ... What do you mean ? What ? - Guys , get ready to jump . - We gotta jump . - What do you mean ? - We gotta jump , we gotta jump ! - We gotta jump ... you ready ? - Jump ! I 'm sure not jumping ... Wait ? What ? It 's cool guys . We got it . Don 't worry about it . - One more crap you 'll stop . - Mm hm . This is incredible . Ssh ! You go where we go , or get left behind . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be sorry . Be smart . - What are you doing ? - We 're bringing them back . He was already dead . There 's nothing you could do for him . Plus we don 't know how many more there are . - We got to be smart . - Guys , will you shut the hell up ? Take that , bitch ! Southard ! Cabrera ! Get back , get back , get back ! - You see anything ? - No , it 's clear . Come on . Let 's go . - Where is your daughter , Chris ? - One block up . Well , let 's get you there . - No no ! - Should we double back ? No , into there ! Go go ! Come on . Go go go go go ! Whoa whoa . Wait ! Wait ! Hide hide hide . Cover yourselves . Do you think it will come in here ? I 'm thinking yes . - Hey Chris , what are we gonna do ? - We got to get rid of that thing . How ? Doing ... Come on ! SCREW YOU Look out ! Go , go find your daughter . Why exactly am I here ? The Meteor Shower that 's been sweeping the world Nothing will live . - We 're not sending you behind enemy lines . - Sounds like sending me to hell . Wait wait wait . What about all those people ? What about them ? We have to get out of here . We going down there , we 're gonna save those people . Are you crazy ? Southard ! Cabrera ! Get back ! Get back ! Get back ! Mankind needs you . Who 's there ? Who 's there ? What are you doing ? I 'm getting out of here . Why ? So , I can get you to safety . From this side ? From them ? Come on , I 'm gonna get you out of here . You 're gonna be alright . Please . You don 't understand . They 've already taken my children . Please ... - They 've already killed me . - Stop . - But I 'm still alive . - Stop , stop . I can 't do that ! Please , please . I can 't do that . I 'm not going to do that . Do you have any children ? Do you ? If you did , you 'd understand . They become your life , your reason for living . - Please . - Sorry . Please ... If not for me , do it for my Ashley , Annie and George . You remind me of him . Please . Please ... - Gordon ! - Hurry , they 're holding us captive . - Quick , get me out of here ! - It 's locked . Hang on . Oh , God , Clayton . Just focus Captain . There 's still hope for you . You and the doctor can bust out of here . Summon the beacon . There is still hope for all of us . Captain , they can 't find you here . You have to get out of here , they 'll kill you in the worst ways . - You have to . - I 'm sorry , soldier . The heck ! Hey ! Hey ! You stay away from him ! You leave him alone ! Can you understand me ? You can 't , right ? Can you ? You aren 't going to do it , are you ? You oughta make a run for the beacon and get the hell out of here . Just do it ! And get out of here . Come on ! Bring it ! Come on ! No , don 't ! Don 't ! Please ! No , no , no ! No ! Look out , look out ! How long has it been ? Nearly six hours since Captain Wheeler 's last transmission . Just over eight since he confirmed the loss of SI 22 . Stay on it . Keep scanning for the distress beacon . Sir . We 're assembling men for the assault but we need more . You think Wheeler 's team ? We lost radio contact hours ago . Any more civilian survivors ? Not many . There 's no telling how many more left . With your permission , sir , I would like to start rounding up anyone with military training to prep for the assault . Permission ? We are talking about the last effort to save our civilization . Our lives , our world . This isn 't war , this is survival . - Get as many as you can . - Yes , sir . Damn it ! Quick , get us something to block ... Run ! Come on , Lindsey ! Lindsey , Lindsey ! Dad ? Dad ! Lindsey ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Damn you ! No ! No ! Lindsey ... Lindsey ! We 've cleared the area , come with us , you 'll be safe . Stop ! Chris ! Hey Meyer ! You got through , I don 't believe it . As for my team though ... they weren 't so lucky . Your daughter ? Gone . Taken . Well , you 're here now . If anyone can keep you safe , it 's us . I don 't think there is a safe place anymore . You 're still alive . I thought they 'd killed you . What did they do to you ? I know their plan . They showed you ? She told me . - She ? - Your queen . She got into my head . And she told me . They are a dying race . Going planet to planet harvesting for her . Their last queen . And they 're keeping her alive . Oh my God . I have seen their plan . And we 're all going to die . No no no ! Don 't lose hope . Look , I need you . Look look look . We still have the beacon . It should be charged now . We can contact Control . Tell them to bring the fight here . Get these bastards where they live . How ? Just stay strong with me . - Southard . - Ah , Captain . - Are you all right ? - No , please tell me there 's a plan . We 're working on it . Oh ! Oh ! Kill good , you bastard ! - James ! - Hang on ! - Oh , it hurts ! - Gonna get you out of here . Oh , no , get out of here ! Go ! Get out of here ! Go ! Oh God ! Mission Control , this is Captain James Wheeler , do you copy ? Over . Mission Control , this is Captain Wheeler . Do you copy ? I hope you 're reading this . We have encountered alien hostiles . And found that they are abducting humans and bringing in to their home planet . There are several ... hundreds more in captivity . We found a way to travel through one of their orb transports and I suggest you do the same . They are a dying , desperate race . There is still hope for us to wipe them out . The asteroid is a launching dock . Fly to it and fire a nuke into the cave near the tracking rods that we 've marked . That will blast it from its core . My ... My entire team , they died as heroes . Please , don 't let their deaths be in vain . You give ' em power and the best of luck to you all . If you are listening to this , you are the resistance . Mankind 's final hope . Over and out . They 're coming . And they 're gonna wipe out your entire race ! Chris ! Chris ! You gonna want to hear this . Soon , we 'll be deploying the greatest assault in our world 's history . Against a threat like never before . Early this morning we received a transmission from United States Marine Captain James Wheeler . In it , he told us that they are holding several civilians captive . Lindsey . But he also told us how to fight them . Where we can take this battle to their doorstep and make them wish that they never stepped on to our planet . Captain Wheeler and his squad gave their lives for this information . And now it 's our turn to honor their sacrifice . This isn 't about politics , or national interests or protecting resources . This is a struggle for all mankind to survive . And we will ! We will survive . Now and forever . And the universe will know that this ... this is our world ! Two teams will fight simultaneously . Assault and Rescue . Assault will be travelling to the alien rock outside of our atmosphere . We will focus our attack on the designated marked target . A clean shot should blow it from its core . - As for Rescue ... Colonel . - We capture one of the alien craft . We 'll take the civilians via weaponized portal , immediately transporting them back to their home planet . Rescue , you 'll move heavily armed , eliminating any hostiles on site ... retrieve any civilians back to the portal . Let 's teach this brave new world the meaning of fear . I 'm trying , baby . Are you ready ? Let 's do this . Dad , will you help me ? The SI 22 's are fueled up and ready . Space . It will be a new part of experience for me . Don 't get lost up there , Colonel . We 're counting on you . Yes , sir . Okay , I almost got it . You might feel a tingling sensation . Eagle Star 1 . Fighters all in . Locked on * * . Roger ! What the hell ? - Anyone else coming ? - More coming . Let 's get our bearings and keep pushing forward . Looks like it up there . Okay , listen up . We 're heading to their compound . We 're going in loud . Heavy gunners , I want you blasting the living hell out of everything that is inhuman . Ready ? Let 's move up ! They know we 're coming . Come on . Let 's keep moving . Look out turning the left . Go to the main entry . Enemy craft . Enemy craft . Fighters engage ! Is that all you got ? Lindsey ! Lindsey ! Dad ! Oh , I found you , I found you ! Are you okay ? Let me see you . - Dad , it was terrible . - Oh I know , I 'm so sorry . - Come on , we gotta go ! Come on ! - Let 's get you out of here . Come on . No ! Lindsey ! - Dad ... - Oh , God . It 's okay , it 's okay , it 's okay . - Dad . - You gonna be okay . - Take me home , Dad . - Okay . Okay baby . Stay with me . Let 's go home now . - I 'm out ! - We 're out of missiles ! Damn ! - Am I late ? - General Magowan ? That 's right . Get these guys off so I can get a clean shot . You heard the General . Evasive maneuvers , let 's go . Target locked . Welcome to oblivion . Fighters , pull back ! - Excellent job , sir . - My pleasure . Lindsey no ! Stay with me . Open your eyes , baby . Open your eyes . No Lindsey , open your eyes , Lindsey . Stay with me ! Dad . Please , it 's over . Please ... It 's not . It 's not over . Not yet .

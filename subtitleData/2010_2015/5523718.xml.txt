 MRS. FREDERIC : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... ADWIN : You are the Guardian now . MRS. FREDERIC : Collodi 's Bracelet . ARTIE : It fell into the hands of a young boy . Named Walt Sykes . The bracelet gave him control of his own body , enabling him to walk . That young boy is now the man who is attacking us . ( SCREAMING ) PETE : I know who 's working for him . A guy by the name of Marcus who just walked away from a five-story fall . ( GRUNTING ) Why can 't I move ? Because I 'm controlling your body now . There are things that you don 't know ! About the Regents ! About Jane ! I am undercover . ( SCREAMING ) No ! Hey , I , uh ... I told Artie . So the Regents are going to send someone to get ... For Steve . Pete ? ( EXHALES ) How could this happen ? MYKA : Claudia , listen to me . We need you to hack into that laptop , okay ? There could be something there that ... Claud , listen to me . We need to find Sykes . All right ? We need to find him and we need to stop him . Claudia ? Myka . Yeah ? Steve is dead . How can you just be business as usual ? Because if I don 't , I will lose it . So , you need to help me . I 'll stay with him . ( CLAUDIA TYPING ) They ran a fat man on the memory . What 's a fat man ? Fat man , little boy , it 's a deletion program . It 's a hacker nuclear bomb . This hard drive is a crater . This was for nothing . Sykes needed H.G. For something . We need to find him . Oh , we 're going to find him . And when we find him , we 're going to get payback . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're not too talkative , Miss Wells . Penny for your thoughts . You killed that young man in cold blood . Really ? What temperature was your blood when you killed ? ( CHUCKLES ) Because you got a bigger body count than I do . And I 'm seriously considering adding one more to that list . Go ahead . Go ahead . Go ahead . ( GROANING ) Come on . Kill me . Cecil B. DeMille 's riding crop . Look at that . Lets my mind control your body . Pretty damn cool , don 't you think ? ( GRUNTS ) What do you want from me ? Some advice . I 'd strongly recommend a good psychologist . ( LAUGHS ) Advice on what ? Opening a certain lock . According to this ... You 've got an old friend who taught you how to do it , right ? Somebody named Caturanga . CATURANGA : Miss Wells . What do you smell ? Miss Wells , what do you smell ? Apples ? ( CHUCKLES ) Yes , you do . Most people do not smell the apples . The Warehouse likes you . Buildings do not have personal affinities . ( LAUGHS ) This is not , as you will discover , just a building , Miss Wells . Welcome to Warehouse 12 . I am Caturanga . And you 're in charge here ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . No . My job is to teach and to solve puzzles . We shall say . What kind of puzzles ? Many sorts . And to design them , too . Sometimes , to house a dangerous artifact like that one . Uh-uh . Sometimes , to brew the perfect cup of tea . Well , this is England , so a good cup of tea is not hard to find . Yes . But the perfect cup of tea , that 's a puzzle . Ah . I 've read some of your stories . You are very gifted . I thought my imagination knew no boundary . But as I stand here , amidst this wonderment ... ( LAUGHS ) There 's always more to learn . I will teach you . ( LAUGHS ) I 'll die before I help you . Oh , you 'll help me . Whether you live or die is entirely up to you . MRS. FREDERIC : It doesn 't get easier , does it ? To lose a fellow agent . I 've lost fellow agents , partners , friends . Steve was my responsibility . You might have told me that he was undercover . Are you angry ? Does it matter ? There 's always a cost . ( ARTIE SIGHS ) What is Sykes planning , and how are we going to stop him ? The Regents are assembling to regroup . I 'll keep you posted . The Warehouse has always endured , Arthur . JAMES : Remember this watch ? We used to argue over it . I think you should have it . Good look , old friend . I imagine you 're going to need it . ( WHIRRING ) You guys all right ? We are on the other side of the world from all right . How did they do it ? An injection . They made it look like a heart attack . I found this stuff on him . I didn 't even know the guy smoked . He didn 't . His father was a chain smoker . Steve hated smoking . That 's my boy . What is that ? It 's Steve doing his job . Hey , guys . The bad news is , if you 're watching this , then I 'm probably screwed . So , I 'll keep it short . Still nothing on Sykes 's end game . He plays it pretty close to the vest . But I can tell you that he 's made travel arrangements to Hong Kong . I don 't know why . It 's definitely not a pleasure trip . There 's one other thing . Sykes 's number two . Marcus Diamond , the guy who doesn 't die , there 's something strange about him . He gets this look when Sykes brings out this wooden box . It 's probably an artifact , Artie . You should check it out . Agent Steve Jinks signing off . Good luck , you guys . Claud ... Keep the faith . Good work , Jinksy . JANE : Indeed . Agent Jinks may have given us the final piece to the puzzle . Why ? What 's in Hong Kong ? Something we thought was gone and buried forever . Walter Sykes may have uncovered the ancient Regent Sanctum . ( RINGING ) MYKA : If the Regent Sanctum was constructed during the era of Warehouse 7 , it predates H.G. By centuries . What does Sykes want with her ? No idea . All knowledge of the Sanctum was purged from Warehouse records when it was finally shut down for good . That was over 100 years ago . And if it was just a meeting place , why would he even care about it ? I got it . Three tickets to Hong Kong purchased from Tyler 's I.P. Address . Three ? Sykes , Tyler , Marcus , H.G. Somebody did not make that trip . MYKA : They 're going to get there before us . And he has an advantage . He knows where it is , and we don 't . I found this in the Escher Vault . It was worn by the Regents of Warehouse 7 . Claudia , see if you can get us the history on this thing . MYKA : Wait , that 's the Chinese symbol for ... Aperture . Aperture could be a facility that manufactures cameras . Or a location that acts as an aperture . Somewhere , light hits a certain way . How very Indiana Jones . The roads . The roads in ... Roads , I remember . The roads kind of ... Hang on a second . Do you see that ? They connect , and it almost forms ... I see it . You two know you haven 't actually finished a sentence yet , right ? Well , the same symbol that means aperture can also mean eye . As in the Eye of Horus ! Look ! This is Hong Kong circa , 1600 . These roads , the roads today are all based on these roads . And take a look at this . Look . The roads form an Eye of Horus . The iris of the eye . It 's a city . ARTIE : Tai Po . Good a place to start as any . We 'll check in when we get there . Claudia , I think it 'd be a good idea ... Excuse me . ARTIE : Claudia ? You have every right to be angry . Agent Jinks was a good man . And what happened was a tragedy . And ? And what ? And I 'm really sorry I sent him to his death ? Steve died alone , cut off from everybody who had his back . And for what ? Why ? Agent Jinks did not want to put any of you at risk . He volunteered for ... To take down Walter Sykes for the good of the world . But let 's face it , Jane . This was never about the good of the world , was it ? This was about your guilt . You made Walter Sykes . No , Claudia , I tried to prevent Walter Sykes from being made . If we 'd gotten to the artifact in time ... But you didn 't , and he became a psychopathic killer . And now , all you care about is fixing your mistake , no matter who gets hurt or killed along the way . That 's not true ! It 's just not ... You 're upset . This is not the time to discuss whether Agent Jinks ... Steve ! His name was Steve ! You know , I see you and the Regents for what you really are ... Cowards . Steve was worth a thousand of you . MYKA : This is exactly where the eye would be , but maybe it 's just a restaurant . Then why did I get a vibe that almost knocked me over ? We 're here in a Chinese restaurant , Mykes , and I 'm not hungry . And I know there 's something here . We are at the dead center of the city , and ... What ? What is it ? If the Sanctum was built that long ago , maybe the restaurant isn 't the Sanctum . What if it 's on top of the Sanctum ? ( MYKA EXHALES ) Well , I would say that we 're in the right place . What do you got ? Well , I doubt H.G. And a stock boy wear the same locket . ( THUD ) Is somebody there ? ( GASPS ) PETE : Nothing . I mean , I don 't know . Maybe they realized it was the wrong place and left . ( EXHALES ) But why do I still have a vibe ? Because H.G. Left that locket as a clue . I know it . Pete ? Yeah . Look at this . It looks like something swept across the floor . ( EXHALES ) What is it ? Like a door opening ? Maybe we can ... ( BLOWING ) The Eye of Horus . I believe the phrase is " Ah-ha . " ( CLICKS ) TYLER : Please , Mr. , Sykes , don 't make me do this . Tyler , make the move the lady suggested . Now ! H. G : This is lunacy . It 's not a move . It 's a guess . I don 't care . We don 't know if we don 't play . Now , move that piece . The first two were wrong . The third could ... SYKES : Enough . Tyler , what are you waiting for ? Look at those skulls . They 're all cracked in half . Yeah , I think I see why . Please , Mr. Sykes . Don 't make him do it . Tyler , you got to be in it to win it . Now . Good lad . H. G : Checkmate . No ! ( GASPS ) First show 's over ! Lattimer and Bering . Come on down ! ( GASPS ) H. G : Myka , are you all right ? I didn 't do that . No , I 'm fine . Myka , that 's only because I controlled where she shot . Next time , her aim 's going to be a lot better , okay ? Let 's go , guys . Guns on the floor , please . Or the next shot 's going to be right between Miss Bering 's beautiful eyes . You son of a ... ( GRUNTS ) Stop it ! MYKA : I don 't understand . Why is there a torture device in the Regents ' Sanctum ? It 's not a torture device , honey . It 's a lock . It was invented by a man named Caturanga . He was rather the Claudia of Warehouse 12 , and my teacher . That 's why you needed Helena . To open it . She 's the only living person who knew this Caturanga . See , the pieces are set so the player 's in check . You win the game , and the lock opens . You lose the game , and your skull opens . H. G : When the Regents shut down the Sanctum a century ago , Caturanga designed the lock . Now , the secret to opening it is not in the journals , but he writes a lot about Miss Wells here . It 's his favorite student . I think she knows about it . Caturanga taught me a thousand things , but I have never seen the chess lock before . I don 't know how to open it . I know , and you clearly demonstrated that with young Tyler here . You did that ! I tried to stop you ! I swear it . You know what ? Maybe I used the wrong incentive . No ! ( SCREAMS ) Myka ! Myka ! Now that there 's somebody in the chair you care about , maybe your memory will come back . What is that ? A gift from a former employer . What do you want from me ? I 'm just an inn keeper . We both know you 're more than that , don 't we ? If you think that I 'm going to help you break into the Warehouse , you 're in for a surprise . No . Now , you see , it 's you people who are going to be surprised . ( BEEPING ) What is that ? ( TYPING ) Something 's wrong at Leena 's ! Pull up the security feeds ! Way ahead of you . ( GRUNTING ) It 's him . Leena . ( GRUNTS ) All right . All right . If we unlock this thing , what are we going to find ? You 'll see . Have you considered that we might be unlocking an artifact deemed too dangerous to be kept in Warehouse 7 ? MYKA : She 's right , you know ? The Regents must have had a reason to keep people out . Don 't tell me about the Regents or the reasons , okay ? You have one choice . Open the lock or she 's going to die . How do we beat it ? It was Caturanga 's passion . We played every day for years . You beat him all the time ? Not once . ( PETE SIGHS ) Oh , great . All right . Time to make a move . With Tyler , I chose the King 's Gambit . Caturanga would have expected that . Perhaps ... Yes , perhaps the ... The Dragon 's variant . Myka , King 's knight to E-6 . ( SHUDDERING ) Check . ( GASPS ) You 're distracting the player , Pete . Queen 's Bishop to H-4 . Check . ( GASPS ) I don 't know what else to do . Helena . Continuing . I 'm sorry , Myka . Helena , listen to me . I am not going to die here today , okay ? Because you are going to take a breath , and you 're going to save my life . H. G : This isn 't what I signed up for . These Regents of yours are gravely mistaken if they think I shall be carrying around this . A Webley Mark I. 450 caliber . Standard issue of the Royal Navy and police constabularies . A fine weapon . Guns have no place in a civilized society , sir . Now , the Regents set the rules , and their rule states all Warehouse agents must carry a firearm . But there is always an alternative to killing . I agree . That is not standard issue . ( CHUCKLES ) I changed the rules . Wells , time for target practice . Is he dead ? No , no . Agent McShane is merely stunned . When the rules do not agree with one , it is sometimes necessary to change them . H. G : Change the rules . What ? Change the rules . H. G : Myka , D-3 to E-8 . Helena , I can 't move my pawn like that . I know . Change the rules . Checkmate . Whatever it is , I think it 's about to open . ( GASPS ) ( GASPS ) ( BEEPS ) Do it . JANE : Artie , what 's that ? Black Barty 's cannon . Black Barty ? Black Barty was one of the most successful pirate captains of the golden age and his cannon from his ship was rumored to have artifact augmented firepower . Are you telling me Walter Sykes ' plan is to fire a cannonball at the Warehouse ? A cannonball wouldn 't worry me , but a cannonball from that cannon ... I 'm approaching worry . I 'm not . ( MYKA GASPS ) What the hell is happening ? ( GROANING ) What just happened ? The Remati Shackle sensed an attack and activated a protective barrier around the Warehouse . We 're safe . I got to get to Leena 's . Once the shackle is activated , I 'm afraid no one can get in or out . Claudia , I want you ... Artie , I have a bad feeling . I have a bad vibe . But you said that nothing could get in once the barrier was up . True . But it can 't stop something that 's already inside . ( RUMBLING ) The Regents wanted to know our vulnerability . I think we just found it . SYKES : Amazing . The Warehouse . ( GRUNTS ) Guys , run ! ( SHRIEKING ) Bastard ! No . No . They must have shut it down from the other side . I hope you don 't mind . I let myself in . Initiating the barrier automatically triggered the emergency exit portal . To the ancient Sanctum . When the Regents abandoned the portal they locked it up , but it wasn 't enough just to trigger it on one side . You had to unlock the Hong Kong side as well . Which is why you needed H.G. You 'd be proud of her . She only killed one guy doing it . Peter , are you hurt ? No . A little tired of this guy , though . You 'll never get what you want . Difference of opinion , Jane . See , I think I 'm going to get exactly what I want . PETE : Artie , no ! ( GRUNTING ) ( GASPS ) Artie ! SYKES : That 'll be your only warning ! Play nice . Artie , I 'm sorry . It 's his crop . It 's got wicked mojo . Are you okay ? I 've been better . Why don 't you just kill us ? Oh , I 'm going to , but we 're going to go find the Collodi Bracelet first . And this time , Jane , you 're going to watch your son hand it to me . There 's got to be another way to open this . I just ... ( INHALES ) I have to think . Myka , I 'm sorry . About what ? I should have destroyed the Janus coin the moment you found it . Then I wouldn 't have caused all of this . I wish that you would stop doing that . Doing what ? You 're not the bad guy , okay ? I believed in you , and I was right , so get off your cross and help me figure this out . Righty-ho , then . Old times . Wells and Bering , solving puzzles , saving the day . Bering and Wells . There are consequences to using the Collodi Bracelet . There were consequences to not using it . It 's a part of me . When I close my eyes , I can see it . Without it , there 's a hole in my soul . That 's what it does to you . It 's not real . It 's not a real need . It is real to me . ( GRUNTING ) Did you not know that , Jane ? Wearing the bracelet creates an insatiable longing . It hardens your heart , it darkens your soul . If we 'd let you keep the bracelet , you never would have been able to love or be loved . If you did everything right , then why are we here ? We didn 't get to you soon enough . The seeds of darkness had already taken root . You 've killed a lot of people , Walter , but I take responsibility for that . Oh , that 's big of you , Jane . It 's not too late . We can still try to save you . Oh , please . I don 't think you 're going to hurt me . I think you understand what I 'm saying . I think you know there 's been enough damage done . I think you 're ready to stop this . But Jane , then you 'd have solace . I want you to feel the guilt and the pain like I have . You should have opted for the opportunity I just gave you . I will take the risk ... And the bracelet . Pete . ( GRUNTING ) ( CELL PHONE BEEPS ) Marcus , I have it . Go ahead . LEENA : You 'll never win . Pete and Myka and the others , they 'll fight back . Possibly . ( GASPS ) But you 'll have had a heart attack by then . Put that syringe down , Mr. Diamond . I 'm impressed . Imagine my delight . Drop it , please . It 's about time . I didn 't think you 'd let me kill her . And I knew you 'd wait for me . You never should have come . I made you a promise a long time ago . I honor my commitments . This is Marcus Diamond , former Baltimore City Detective , shot in the line of duty . Three times . Dead center . And you lived ? Bullets are still in his heart . If you know that much about me , you know that medal won 't kill me . Yes , but it will cause you unending pain . You have no idea what 's about to happen . Oh , but I do . Finally . Right where it belongs . You got what you wanted . Get out . No . This is just step one . Before you die , I want you to know what it feels like when something you love is ripped away from you . ( GRUNTING ) No . Please ! I am responsible . Kill me ! PETE : Myka ! Thank god ! Come on ! ( CHOKING ) You got to circle around . Don 't let him in the portal . H. G : Myka . H. G ! Rigging rope from the Mary Celeste . Hang on ! No , Myka , don 't ! ( MOANS ) " Touch the rope , " I imagine , was the rest of that sentence . ( GRUNTING ) If you pull on it , it only gets tighter . That 's good to know . ( GRUNTING ) When will you ever learn not to play with these things ? ( GASPING ) ( COUGHING ) Let 's go . Oh ! ( LAUGHS ) Hey . You 're too young to have seen the Frazier-Ali fight , right ? What ? Oh ! He never saw the right uppercut coming . MARCUS : You know , I think we 're beyond needing to make your death look like an accident . No ! ( GASPS ) ( MOANS ) ( SHUDDERING ) LEENA : Claudia , what is that ? MARCUS : No . ( GRUNTS ) This is Johann Maelzel 's Metronome . Sykes uses it to keep Marcus alive . That was for Steve . ( SHOTS FIRING ) JANE : Thank God Myka left it open . Get away from her ! ( GRUNTS ) Walk into this ! JANE : Walter ! Walter , take my hand . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Mom ! Are you are you okay ? Yes . You ? Yeah . Walter Sykes has , uh , left the building . The portal 's kaput . You 're going to need to fly back . All right , so get home safe , okay ? And , Mom ... I love you . I love you too , honey . Pete ! What happened ? Where are they ? What took you guys so long ? Just lazy , I guess . Sykes ? Dead . Is Jane all right ? Well , she 's got a 15-hour plane ride ahead of her , but yeah , she 's okay . ( EXHALES ) Thank you . Any time . Uh ... ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) Claud , hey , are you okay ? Yeah . So are Leena and Mrs. Frederic . Marcus is dead . It 's over . Why is that light still on ? What ... What is it ? They 're all on . MYKA : Artie , Artie , what 's wrong ? Wait . Mrs. Frederic , how long should the barrier normally stay active ? Once the danger to the Warehouse passes , it dissipates instantly . PETE : Well , then why is it still up ? The Warehouse isn 't in danger anymore . Is it ? Was he just going to collect the Collodi artifact and walk out of here ? He said he was going to kill us all , but he never tried to . A man who can walk does not need ... He planned on leaving it behind . Yeah , but why ? Uh-oh . I know that writing . That 's from the House of Commons in London . Oh , no . How bad ? The House of Commons was partially destroyed during the Blitzkrieg of World War II . There was a piece of masonry that was said to have absorbed the concussive force of the entire German Luftwaffe . This case is an artifact nuclear device ... And it 's counting down . ( BEEPING ) The Ovoid Quarantine could offer some protection to the rest of the Warehouse , but I doubt it . I don 't understand . I mean , who builds a force field that locks you in ? Well , the barrier was initiated first as a way of dealing with external danger . The barrier 's still active , but now , the point . The primary function of the Warehouse is to protect the world from artifacts . The barrier now , its mandate has shifted ... To containing the blast and protecting the world from an artifact fallout . If there is a big , ugly explosion , and unfortunately , there are agents inside , that 's just collateral damage . There 's less than two minutes left on the detonator . All right . Let me at that thing . LEENA : I 'm not finding anything yet . Keep looking . Something 's got to neutralize that bomb . Something . I can 't find anything in the databases , either . Wait , so why can 't we just go to the Warehouse and find a way to break them out even if we can 't stop the explosion . We can 't get through the barrier . Besides , there isn 't time . Oh , can I maybe hack my way in and deactivate the barrier that way ? The power isn 't derived from the main system . It 's derived from the Ramadi Shackle . Claudia , you 're going to have to give me back that metronome , please . Now , please . No . You know we can 't use artifacts to ... What I know is I 'm tired of arbitrary rules . The metronome is for Steve , and I 'm bringing him back . ( EXHALES ) Nope . Takes a licking , and keeps on trying to kill us . Okay , the portal 's closed . There 's no back door . ARTIE : No . No back door outside the barrier , anyway . Come on , Myka , we 've gotten out of worse than this . No , we have , we have the solution , and we can find it . All we have to do is keep a cool head . We 'll find it in ... ( BEEPING ) Fifty-six seconds . You did say that we 'd go out together . I always figured we would . Not me . I was planning on outliving both of you lunatics . ( CHUCKLES ) And here we go . Hey . Helena . What are you doing ? She 's trapped us . Helena , what is this ? Sorry . It was the only way I could think to save you . What have you done ? There was no other way . An anomaly in the system allowed me to reroute a portion of the outer barrier to that spot on the floor . I just hope it lasts . You 've protected us from the blast . You should be safe now . But you 're ... You 're out there . It had to be initiated from outside the barrier . No . Listen . You got to let us help you . There 's a way we can do this . We just avoided destroying you . You 're going to throw it all away ? I just started liking you . Don 't stop now . ( INAUDIBLE ) I smell apples . ( CONTINUOUS BEEPING ) ( RUMBLING ) Oh ! ( GASPING ) LEENA : Claudia , the Warehouse ! Mrs. Frederic ! ( EXHALES ) That was his plan , to destroy the entire Warehouse . We lost , Artie . We lost . Not yet .

 I remembered a joke . It 's funny . A man and his wife were having sex one night , when their young son suddenly enters the room . Wait a moment . Are we going in the right direction ? Olav ! Where is it ? I don 't see anything . Just keep going . It 's not far . I 'll let you know when we get there . Okay . Continue the joke . The boy gets scared and runs out of the room , crying . The mother says : " Honey , now what should we do ? " You know women ... The father says : " Let me handle this . " Then he goes to the child 's bedroom . He opens the door ... and the boy is lying on top of his grandmother . Having sex with her ! He 's wildly going up and down , up and down . And then he looks at the father and says : " You play with mine , I play with yours , right ? " Stop ! Is it here ? We 're on top of it . Don 't move ! Don 't move ! Turn on the lights . Oh my God ! Careful . Edvard ! You got back . - Of course . For our discovery ! Cheers ! There is nothing here . - No . It 's underneath it . - Yeah . Careful . Be careful ! Hell ! Let 's get the others ! Put it out , dammit ! What do you guys think we should do ? Peder , bring that thing . We have four missing persons . We have no helicopter or radio . You made a mistake bringing them here . More people could die . Sander , we don 't know if they are dead or not . That 's enough . Burn in hell . Yes , that 's it . All done . Grenades . Let 's go , Lars . - Okay . Let 's finish them off ! Take it easy . Damn ! Try to put it out ! Open your mouth . Come on ! It 's your turn . Open your mouth ! Open your mouth . She wants us to get the Americans . - Let 's go then . Let 's go ! She is smart . Yes . She has control now . Shit ! They have escaped . Lars , let 's go back inside . No . We have to find them . Lars , be careful ! They 're not human ! Lars ! Lars ! Wait ! Peder ... Calm down . The threat isn 't here . It 's out there . The Americans are the real enemy . He 's right , Peder . Peder ! They took Lars ! We gotta help him ! Peder , they have Lars . The enemy is out there . Where is Lars ? Where is Lars ? Peder , don 't listen to them ! They killed Lars ! They killed him ! Burn them ! Burn them ! Peder ? Peder ? It 's gonna catch fire ! It will explode ! Edvard ? Edvard ? Help ! Help me ! Oh my God ! Hello ? Can anybody hear me ? Hello ? Hello ? Anyone ? Edvard ? Hello ? Lars , it 's me . Hello ? Lars ? Lars , it 's Matias . Open your mouth . - What ? Do as I say , now ! What the hell is gloing on ? Lars , it 's me , Matias . That 's no dog . Start the helicopter , now ! Lift it up ! Now ! Hurry !

 - Previously on warehouse 13 ... - Why am I having these headaches ? - When macpherson was part of your consciousness , He may have left something behind . - Paris , 1899 . My daughter christina had been murdered . - H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated As a warehouse agent . - Thank you , sir . - And no matter how much good She 's done for all of us , I 'll never trust that woman . Someone has found the lost warehouse . It was always believed to be somewhere near alexandria . - Warehouse 2 is back online . - So we need to find warehouse 2 And shut it down . - H.G. , guess who just saved the day . - Myka . Myka . Myka . Myka , come on . - Pete ? - Come on , get up . We gotta go . - Pete , where am I ? - Egypt , warehouse 2 , And we are in big trouble . - Big bump . - I know . I got one to match . - What 's that sound ? - That 's sand . No , I 'm sorry , scratch that . It 's the whole freakin sahara desert . This place is filling up with sand , myka . The way we came in is history . I don 't know , when h.G. Bolted She must have triggered some kind of self-preservation thing , Something that protects the artifacts . - H.G. , she played us ! She played me ! - Oh , big time . - Oh , I 'll kill her . I 'm gonna kill her ! - Myka . - What ? - I get the whole anger thing , But could you please just channel it Into finding us a way outta here ? - Okay , okay . Our warehouse , right , there 's a back door In our warehouse , so there must be one here too . - Bingo ! - Right . Pete , look , a hatch ! - What ? Whoo-hoo ! Yeah ! Myka , you found a hatch . - Yeah ! - A hatch ! - Whoo ! - 100 feet up there , So not as good , but- - - Well , it wouldn 't be up there If there wasn 't a way to get to it . - Right . - Right ? So let 's look for something , you know . - Egyptian endless wonder . - Right . - Get it . Yeah ! - Okay , just keep searching the shelves , okay ? There 's gotta be- - there 's gotta be something . I don 't know , like , a magic ladder , Or--or a catapult Or something . - And go . - It 's probably just a rug , pete ! - And move , and fly . - Oh , my god . Pete , I 'm looking at the ten original books of plato . - Is there a chapter on flying ? - Not that I remember . - Oh , oh , oh . What about- - What about a snake around a staff ? Isn 't that a medical symbol ? - Uh , that 's probably the rod of asclepius . It 's probably some sort of healing device . - Yes , we can definitely use this . Ah . Or not . Pardon me , sir . - Pete ! Pete , over here ! - Whoa . - Right ? Okay , these wings were probably designed by daedalus . He was the father of- - - icarus . Ha , even I know that one . - Turn around . - What , why me ? You 're the one that eats like a bird . - Well , just don 't get us too close to the sun , okay ? - They smell . Oh . Whoa . These things actually attract wind . - Yeah , they generate their own lift . - Holy crap ! Whoa . Can you imagine watching a browns game like this ? - Yeah , I bet that 's exactly what daedalus had in mind . Up . Pete , up . - Ah , the hatch ! - Yeah . - All right , get it , get it , get it , get it . - Okay , stop , stop . You ready ? - Yeah , yeah , yeah . Go ! - It 's stuck . - Well , yank it . Yank it hard . - Really ? At a time like this ? - I 'm sorry . Oh , what ? - Come on ! Pete , do you hear that ? That 's the farnsworth . It must be working again . - We must be high enough . Back pocket . - What ? Okay . - Yeah . Ooh . - Stop laughing ! Okay , okay . - Okay . - Okay . - Artie . - Hi . - Myka , listen , h.G. Is a bad guy . We know ! - Pete , good , you 're together . - Yeah , we always kind of thought we 'd go out this way . Look , artie , valda 's dead . Warehouse 2 is filling with sand . - Artie , listen , I 'm really sorry . - Tell kelly that I love her . Tell her to- - - Shh , shh , shh , shh . Close your eyes . - Close your eyes ? That 's the last thing he 's gonna say to us ? I always thought it would be a little more , you know , Meaningful . - He didn 't even say good-bye . - I know . - Oh . - Oh , myka , hold on , hold on . - Pete , close your eyes ! - I can 't see . Okay . - The wings of daedalus . Good call . Don 't just flap there . Come on out . - Here we come . Hold on . Whoo . Whoo , man , you have got to let me keep these . - Oh , right , because they worked out so well for icarus . - Artie , who are you , jerusalem jones ? - What ? I just bought this . - So how 'd you find us ? - I pinpointed the coordinates on your farnsworth . - Good thing it started working again . - Yeah , they 're designed to work deep underground , But when I lost the signal I realized that h.G. Had jammed it . I knew you were in trouble . When I got here , I reset the frequency . It was a piece of cake . - Finally , listen , h.G. ' s a bad guy . We know ! - Judging from the depth of her preparation , It seems obvious to me that h.G. Wells Has been planning this for a long- - And I mean a long--time . - She hacked into the warehouse account To fund those students . - Yes , and she discovered , somehow , the location Of warehouse 2 even before she was bronzed . Did macpherson know that somehow ? - Yeah , but she needed experienced agents To get in there . - Well , she obviously wanted an artifact , But which one ? - The place is filled with sand , artie . It 's gonna take months to dig out . - Artie , is there- - is there some kind of inventory Of warehouse 2 ? - Yes . For a time , I had a cognitive connection To warehouse 2 . Much of its inventory was downloaded into my mind . - Hell of a backup drive . - Can you access it ? - I can try . It 's fading . Tell me quickly what you remember Of h.G. ' s last position . - Well , myka and I were in the office Trying to figure out where the key went , right ? And then h.G. Ran to see if she could turn off the orb . - She went to the main floor . - Can you describe the area In which she was ultimately found ? - There was- - there was vases . There was lots of clay pots and vases . - How can she spot what 's missing ? She 's just that good ? - Yes . Now I assume that warehouse 2 Has an inventory system like ours . - Each item is labeled with a hieroglyph of anubis . If anubis is sitting , then the item is in its proper place . If anubis is running ... Ah . Rack of spears . One is missing . - Rack of spears . Missing spear , labeled in any way ? - Yes . Fading . I can 't tell you . The image is gone . - Okay , no . Artie , this is progress , right ? We don 't know where she is , but- - - Paris . I 'm still tracking h.G. ' s access to funds . She just bought a ticket from cairo to de gaulle . - Why paris ? - When pete and myka were in 1961 , H.G. Told me her daughter was murdered in paris . - Okay , so she 's returning to the scene of the crime . - Or that 's where christina is buried . - Maybe the spear has resurrection properties . - She wants to bring her daughter back from the dead ? - I don 't know about spears , but I can tell you Resurrection is a dangerous practice And always comes at a price . - Yeah , look at mickey rourke . - So- - All right , pete , myka , you go to paris . Claudia , you try to find out Exactly where christina 's buried . I will do research on spears . Mrs. Frederic , you- - Will just be mrs . Frederic . - Hey , it 's kelly . You mind ? - Sure , pete , we 've got nothing but time . - Kelly , hey . I was just gonna call you . - What happened to you ? Two days ago we had a vague conversation About moving in together , and then- - Then you disappear . - Ugh , kelly , I 'm- - Look , I 'm so sorry . You know , you must think I 'm the biggest jerk in the world . - Well , I went between that And wondering if I should be calling hospitals . - No , no , no , no . I 'm fine , I 'm fine . It 's a long story . I had a sudden business trip . - pete ! - Look , um , kelly , We got a lot to talk about . - Pete , you know , if you don 't want to see me anymore , it 's- - - No , no , kelly , look , I- - I love seeing you . Okay , you 're my happiest place on earth . - You mean that ? - I know it in my soul . Okay , I just--I 've got this one more trip , And then I 'm yours completely . - The minute you get back . - The second I get back . And , kelly ... I love you . Okay , I said it . Yes , I even said it first . So go ahead , make fun . - I 'm really glad you found someone , pete . You deserve it . - Okay , now I really feel like a girl . - Well , hike up your skirt , 'cause we got a bad guy to catch . - Boo-yah ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Hang back there , pointer sister . - Sorry , sorry . I thought , you know , handling some ancient spears Would trigger a notion , but- - - Okay , well , I 'm sorry to interrupt you While you 're handling your ancient spear , But I found christina 's gravesite . - Good . You let pete and myka know ? - Texted them . They land at de gaulle any minute . - All right . Um , artie , can I talk to you about something ? - Will it make me feel old and uncomfortable ? - Not this time . - All right , go on . - Okay , when dr . Vanessa Was here trying to save mrs . Frederic , She , um ... She said something that kinda scared me . When it looked like mrs . F. Might not make it , She said that I should be ready . - And you want to know , ready for what , hmm ? - Actually no . Uh , I 'm--I 'm pretty sure I 'm not ready . I know that I might talk big sometimes , artie , But I can 't even buy a wine cooler in this state , So whatever you might have planned for me- - - Breathe , breathe , breathe , breathe , breathe . You can do whatever you want . You control your own destiny . - But she said- - - No , nothing has been decided Or will be decided Without your complete consent . - You promise ? - With all my heart . You will live the life that you want , And I 'll make sure of that . - Oh , thank you . - Voila , monsieur . - According to claudia , the cimetiere du rennes Should be right around this corner . - H.G. ' s probably already here . - Good , first time , shame on her . Second time , I 'm bringing that bitch down . - I love it when you talk dirty . - What ? - Where 's the cemetery ? - It has to be here . This is the address . - Excuse me . Hi , uh , excuse me . Uh , do you speak english ? We 're looking for " the cemetery du ron . " - Cimetiere du rennes moved Many years ago . - To where ? - Bah . - Ew . - What now ? - Okay , look , if h.G. ' s plan Was to resurrect her daughter , Then she needed to arrange for the upkeep Of her remains , right ? Which means there 's an estate . And estates have lawyers . - French lawyer . Bah ! - Bah . - Mr. Sempe , thank you for taking this walk with me . - If you want to visit christina wells ' resting place , I can give you the address . You don 't need me . - Oh , but I do . I don 't want to go all around paris shooting people . As my lawyer , you can give me full access . - Full access ? I don 't understand . - You don 't have to understand . You just need to sign whatever needs to be signed . - Then what ? - And then maybe I 'll let you live . - You check the girl . I 'll look for the lawyer . It 's empty . He 's gone . - She 's in shock . Look , if h.G. Shot her with the same gun That she used on us ... - Then she 's come and gone already . - Pete . Look . - I 'm grateful she 's been taken care of To my specifications . - I signed the papers . You can do whatever you want in here . May I leave now ? - In a moment . Don 't be rude . Remove your shoes and step into this , please . - Madame , please , I 'm just a simple lawyer . Not even a very good one . - Now would be nice . - What is it ? - Primordial tar from pitch lake in trinidad . Don 't really have time to explain what it does . You wouldn 't believe me anyway . I 'm stuck . - You have no idea . Help me ! Help me ! Help me . - No ! If you put water in it , it turns it into a tar pit . - Don 't fight it , dude . That 's what the woolly mammoths did . - Pete , h.G. , she ran down there . - Oh , mon dieu . What in the hell was that ? - Monsieur sempe , you mind waiting outside ? - Happily . - This place is a labyrinth . She 's gone . - Pete , would you mind- - - What ? - You know , looking to see if christina ... Ew . - Yep , she 's dead . Still really dead . - Okay . Pete . - Yeah ? - H.G. Didn 't even have the spear with her . - Yeah , but we don 't even know how it works . - No , no , something- - Something is wrong . She took something , something that 's missing . The handle . - Are you sure there was a handle ? - Yes , and then the other one 's right there . - Show me . - Okay , if you can 't see it , the ends have points , Like--like arrows . - I 've seen that shape before . - Where ? - I don 't know what it is , But I can 't get it out of my head . Look . - Macpherson must have left an image of it Inadvertently via the pearl . - Okay , wait , wait , wait , wait . Let 's look at that shape From different angles . Now what did myka say , that the tips have points or- - - Like arrows . - Like arrows , all right . Like arrows . Now ... Does this suggest an- - Mrs. Frederic , do you see- - - See what ? - It 's not a spear . It 's ... - The minoan trident . - So a bad thing ? - What 's the minoan trident ? - A weapon of mass destruction . The first weapon of mass destruction . - Okay , okay , wait . The minoan trident was the first Weapon of mass destruction ? - The trident was the first artifact locked away By alexander the great in what became warehouse 1 . - In the 15th century b.C.E. , The minoan civilization was destroyed By a catastrophic volcanic eruption . - Oh , I know this one . It 's the thera volcano , Which created the island of santorini . - The thera eruption was thought to have been caused By a trident , which when jammed into the ground Three times causes a fissure in the earth 's surface . - If done in the right place , It could unleash a volcanic eruption . - Is that what plato based the story of atlantis on ? - Right , right . Poseidon had a trident . I played him in the fifth grade With a pitchfork and a toga . Beat out ralph brunskie for that part . Kid had a voice like jennifer tilly . I am poseidon . - I 'm--I 'm terribly sorry . - Que sera . Peter ... The trident is real . - That 's one of the reasons the romans came to egypt . Caesar wanted that power . - That explains why the trident is in two pieces . - H.G. Found part of it in the 1800s And hid it on her daughter 's casket . - And macpherson debronzed her So he could find warehouse 2 And the other half of the trident . - That 's why she killed him . He was about to tell us . - Yeah , the question is : Now that she 's got both parts , What is she planning to do with them ? - Someone evil just bought a plane ticket . - To ? - Casper / natrona international , wyoming . - That 's only two hours away from here . - All right , get back here right now . Macpherson was collecting artifacts To sell them to the highest bidder . Do we think that h.G. Is doing the same thing ? - Let 's hope so . The alternative could be unpleasant . - Good , boy . You did great , harvey . There 's a lot less to lick now , But I promise you it 'll make your life A whole lot easier . When I saw this , I thought of you . Oh , pete . Gorgeous . Oh . Look , harvey . He even engraved it with our favorite breed . Let 's send him a picture of us using it . - It looks like things are okay between me and kelly . - Why would you say that ? - She sent me some pictures ... With her and a little puppy . Look , she 's powdering his nose . Look at the little puppy . Okay , it 's official . I 'm a girl . - You had a lot of vibes about h.G. , didn 't you ? - No , not really . - God , you 're a terrible liar . - What ? Look , I trust your instincts , mykes . We 're partners , a team . - Yeah , well , I put the team in danger Because I thought I knew better than everybody else . - Look , you need to forget about that . Okay , there 's no way that any of us could be sure that- - - No , there was plenty of doubt from everyone but me . - H.G. Has a huge advantage , myka . She 's willing to lie , steal , and kill To get what she wants , and we 're not . So I 'm gonna side with us on this one . With you . Lattimer . - Oh , good , you 've landed . I do hate voicemail . - Oh , hey , lady koo-koo . We were just talking about you . Well , what , are you calling To play a little game of let 's make a deal ? - Oh , I 'm afraid not , dear boy . - Oh , come on . Nutjob like you must have quite a wish list . How ' bout a little electroshock therapy , Zap the crazy right out of you ? - Run a trace on pete 's phone . - Already happening . - We put a trace on both Your phones as soon as you got to paris just in case . - Once I lock in on her signal , I can track her with this . - With what ? What is that ? Show me- - are you messing around With stuff in the farnsworth aisle ? - I 've been quite impressed , Keeping up with me as you have . Not quite catching me of course , But then I am me . - Well , go ahead , get nice and comfy . - Oh , don 't worry . I 've closed all my accounts and buried my trail . - So now are you just calling to brag Or did you get a sudden craving to be bronzed again ? 'cause we can make that happen for you . - For such a mediocre kisser , I 'd have thought you 'd at least have brains . - Yeah , well , you taste about as old as you are , So right back at you there , grandma . Now what do you want ? - Just to suggest that you check in on kelly About now . - Pete , don 't- - - Listen , you leave her the hell alone . She has nothing to do with this . - Oh , I haven 't done a thing . But you , you sent her a lovely gift . I 'm sure she 'll be crazy for it . - We have to get to kelly . - No , no , no , no , she 's just trying to distract us . - Artie , I can 't stay here , I gotta go . - All right , just watch your back . - Got her . - Where is she ? - Wyoming , and not far , but- - - what ? - She 's not stationary . She 's moving . Looks like I-26 , heading for bryson reservoir . - Bryson , bryson reservoir . Bryson , bryson , it 's in the middle of nowhere . I mean , it 's not even a tourist stop on the way to- - Yellowstone . - She 's on a road trip to see america ? - She can 't be . - You don 't think that- - - You don 't think what ? She can 't be what ? - The yellowstone caldera . Artie . - I 've got a map here . Not this , this . A seismic hazard map Of the six known supervolcanoes in the world , And the most powerful of which is thought to be Yellowstone caldera , which is under- - Well , it 's under wyoming , idaho , and montana . - Are you kidding me ? People go there for vacation . - If h.G. Were to jam the trident into the ground there- - - It would cause a chain reaction Of monstrous proportions . Millions would die immediately , But there 's a far greater problem . - Bigger than millions would die ? - The last supervolcano that erupted Was 75,000 years ago . Triggered an ice age . Only 6,000 humans survived . Claudia , go back up pete . You and I are going to yellowstone . She 's taking a car . We 'll take a chopper . We 'll get there ahead of her . Go , go , go . - Right , hey . - You know , this is kinda cool . - Good luck . - Yeah . - Can we get there in time ? - We have to . - Kelly , are you here ? Kelly ? Kelly ? - I 've been waiting for you . Oh , my god . You scared me to death . I thought- - Hey , no , ha , hey ! Kelly , wait a minute ! Just hold on ! Just--just cut it out ! - That is exactly what I intend to do , Cut it out . Gotta be an artifact . Even I can 't make women this angry . - Just stand still . - Listen , kelly , somebody did something to you , And I don 't know what , But just , please , you gotta trust me . - I love you , pete . - Oh , babe . Babe , I love you too . - And that 's why I have to kill you . Really ? Really ? No ! Give me that . - Pete . What are you doing ? - Kelly , are you back ? - What 's going on ? Let go of me ! - It must be the knife . What , she gave you lorena bobbitt 's knife ? - I 'm so thirsty . - Okay , come on , baby . Come on , come on . - God , I need some water . - Are you okay ? - No , get me some water . - All right , hold on , I 'll be right back . Ow . Oh , god . Are you putting me down ? - Now we 'll do this the easy way . - Artie , something 's fishy . Pete , won 't answer his phone . - Don 't worry , claudia has his back . She 's gotta be right around here . - The magma chamber is highest here . - Right here ? - Yeah . - Okay . - What 's that for ? - This is a subterranean heat sensor . Reaches thousands of feet into the ground and- - Okay , wow , the temperature is astronomical here . If she 's coming , she 's coming here . - And here she is . I 'm not surprised you found me . But I 'm quite baffled that you expect To do anything about it . - And what could you possibly want That you would go to these lengths ? What , money ? Power ? What ? - Nothing ! - Nothing ? What do you mean nothing ? You obviously know what you 're holding . - This isn 't a bargaining tool . I intend to use it Right here , right now . - Hiya , kelly . What 's up ? - Claudia , you can 't be here right now . I have work to do . - Uh , kelly , hey , hey . Hold on a second . What are you doing there ? - Chopping pete up into little bits . - Uh-huh , right . And why ? - Because I love him . - And that 's a beautiful way to show it , but , um- - - Claudia , if you don 't get out of my way , I 'm going to have to kill you . - I 'd really rather you just give me the ax . - All right then . - There 's got to be something here . Did somebody send you that ax ? - Let go of me ! - What 's new here , kel ? - compact ! - Hello , antique-y . Where 'd you come from ? - Pete sent it to me . - Hang on a sec , pete . Kinda got my hands full here . L--l.A.B. Laboratory ? No . Ah ! Initials . Okay , lonny ? Lindsay ? Larry ? Lizzie ? Lizzie . Lizzie borden ! Woot ! - Lizzie borden took an ax and gave her father 40 whacks . - And when the job was neatly done , She gave her mother 41 . - My god . What 's going on ? And why is pete tied to my table ? Claudia , what 's happening ? - It 's okay . Somebody , I can 't tell you who , Gave you lizzie borden 's compact . Lizzie andrew borden . I did a term paper on her . Apparently you name your daughter andrew , And she chops you into little bits . Big surprise . - I tried to kill pete . - No , it 's--it 's okay . - Why would I do that ? - Well , looking into the compact Probably makes you kill the thing you love . So maybe lizzie did it after all . - What are you talking about ? - No , no , baby , baby . Baby , this is good , okay ? This means that you love me . - Stop . - See , ' cause the truth is- - - Stop ! I tried to kill you . - Wait , kelly . Hey , kelly , kelly , it 's all right . - Just give it a rest for a bit . Give her head time to catch up . - Wait , I don 't understand . Why would you kill millions of innocent people ? - Innocent ? Open your eyes , myka . Have you looked at the world in which you live ? - So because you lost your daughter , because you 're angry- - - No , don 't you dare . This may have begun with christina 's murder , But it 's not about that . Yeah , I foolishly believed That if I could find a way to travel through time Then things would have improved , A utopia would have emerged , But here we are over a century later And things have actually gotten worse . The divide between rich and poor , Hunger and famine , war and violence and hatred , All flourishing beyond control . Indeed men have found new ways to kill each other That were inconceivable in my day Even by fiction writers . - But millions of us are struggling Against that every day . - This planet needs a rest from what you 've done to it . It needs a chance to repair itself . - Oh , my god , you seriously intend To start another ice age . - The only way to save this world Is by destroying the parasites who are eating it alive . - I don 't normally do this . - And you 're gonna wish you hadn 't . - Artie ? - Oh ? - Artie , what is it ? - Artie , what is it ? - The corsican vest ? - I 'm afraid so . - Artie , what 's- - what 's happening ? - Well , the vest , It belonged to the corsican brothers . Twins . When one of them got hurt , The other felt it . - You did that to yourself . - Where did you find it , venice ? - Fort lauderdale . - Oh , of course . - Ahh ! - Myka ! Three times . Don 't let her do it three times . - I won 't . Hey ! - I wouldn 't . - Myka , talk to her . Talk to her . - So what , The entire planet is subject to your judgment now ? What about the millions of mothers Who are gonna lose their daughters Just like you lost christina ? Is that right ? - This is no world for a child . - I don 't think you believe that . - I do . Watch me . - No ! - Myka , that 's two . - You are lying to yourself . You never wanted this . If you wanted to kill pete and me , You would have done it at warehouse 2 Or in paris . And artie , you would have let him die in russia , But you didn 't . - I needed you to trust me . - No , you needed us to stop you . You wanted us to follow you and stop you . That 's why you called pete this morning . Think , helena . You are so filled with grief and anger , But there is a part of you , I know it , There is some small part of your soul That knows that this is wrong , And--and that part is still alive , And it 's just pushing to get through . Yes . That 's the part that refuses to kill The very people who can stop you . - No ! Stay away from me . - All right . If I am wrong , then kill me . Do it ! Kill me now . I mean , we 're all gonna die anyway , right ? So what 's the difference ? So shoot me . Shoot me now . Kill me . But not like that . Not like a coward . I want you to look me in the eyes And take my life . Come on . Do it . Do it ! - So if you 're not gonna Put h.G. Wells back in the bronze sector , Where 's she gonna go , Some other weird place that we don 't know about ? - The less you know , The better you 'll be able to do your job . - That doesn 't sound good . - You both did excellent work retrieving that artifact And preventing a worldwide disaster . That , of course , is the prime directive Of warehouse agents . H.G. Wells was a formidable opponent . She fooled us all . - She didn 't fool artie . Fortunately , I 'm still a lousy shot with a real gun . - Are you gonna die on us every year ? 'cause it 's getting kinda boring . - I 'm gonna keep dying until it takes , Or not . Ah , it hurts when I shrug . - Yeah , well , I bet wagging your finger At me , old man , will be- - - Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , hey , kiddo . Hey . I plan on making your life hell for a very long time . - Can I hug you ? - Maybe later in the week . - Okay . - Hey . What are you , uh , putting together Some stuff for a shelter ? - I 'm leaving . - okay , okay , look . I 'm sorry . I 've been really busy at work , But I found some bones in the garbage today And they 're very- - I know , I know , I know . I--I 've been wanting to tell you , but ... Okay , I don 't really work at an I.R.S. Warehouse . - No kidding . - All right , just- - just listen , okay ? The rule is I can tell one person , One really important person , so- - - No , don 't . I am not the one , pete . So please don 't tell me . I don 't want a complicated life . - Complic- - It 's not that complicated . Kelly , it 's way more simple than it looks . Okay , lizzie borden 's compact Makes you kill the one you love , Like she killed her dad . You love me , and I love you . It 's simple . - It 's just that your life Is filled with excitement , And danger , And just insanity , And it 's--it 's all the things that I don 't want . - There are quiet days too . - Good-bye , pete . Stay safe . - Hey . - What 's up ? I 've been , um ... Trying to figure out ways To simplify my life , And it all boils down to three words . " quit your job , pete . " Four words . - Mm-hmm . - I wasn 't counting " pete . " - So then what ? - I don 't know , get kelly back . I don 't know , try and live a normal life . - What ? - If you had wanted to do that , You would have already left . - Look , just because that worked on h.G. Doesn 't- - - This--this is the right life for you . It is . You were born for it . And you 're really , really , really good at it . You are . You need this warehouse , And this- - Warehouse 13 needs you . You can 't quit . - Yeah . - Yeah . - All right , I 'm gonna go see artie . You coming ? - Um , pete , I- - In a bit . - Okay . - Okay . - I understand you wanted to see me . - Yeah . Yes . Would you- - Would you give this to artie , please ? - Myka . You can 't blame yourself . It could have happened to any one of us . - But it didn 't . It happened to me . - You talked her down . You saved us all . - It should never have come to that . I put the entire world in jeopardy . I can 't even conceive of that . I just know that I can 't- - I can 't take that chance again .

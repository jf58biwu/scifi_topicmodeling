 Oh my God . It 's a one-way glass . He can 't see you . He looks so much older . captivity will do that . He does look exactly like my husband , but ... you can 't be sure - the aliens are still improving their ability to mimic us . Where did you find him ? Montana . We pushed the aliens back for once and he used the confusion to sneak through their lines - that is if he is your husband . We need you to debrief him . It needs to be intimate things a wife would know that wouldn 't be in the files or that he wouldn 't have told them . Isn 't there any other way ? I thought you 'd be eager to talk to him . How eager would you be ? Make one mistake and I condemn the man I love to death . Em . Oh , Herb ! I said if I ever got captured , I 'd make it home . Yeah . As well as can be expected . How about you ? I 'm fine . They 're fine . They 're at Mom 's . Except for you . I miss them on the odd days . I miss you on the even days . Well - Get to it . Ask what you need to know . Where did we get married first time around ? We eloped . Colombus , Ohio . And your dad was pissed . I was only nineteen . What was the guy who was marrying us wearing ? My God , he was dressed up like Elvis - shades and all . It was you , Em . It was you that gave me the strength to get through it all . What ? I don 't know . The truth is - The truth is an uncarved block of wood . What , you don 't - You don 't remember Uncle Harry 's little saying ? Oh , yeah ! I 'm sorry . I 'm not really thinking of Uncle Harry right now . She 's a fake . What ? What ? Herb ? Herb ! There is no Uncle Harry . Herb ! You 're making a mistake ! Herb ! NOOOOOOOOO !

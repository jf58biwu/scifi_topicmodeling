[ knock on door ] THERE 'S SOMETHING YOU BOTH NEED TO SEE . THE RADIO 'S WORKING . THE PATTERN 'S REPEATING ON A LOOP . IT 'S LIKE IT 'S SOME KIND OF MORSE CODE , BUT IT 'S NOT MORSE CODE , OR AT LEAST IT 'S NOT ANY MORSE CODE THAT I 'VE EVER HEARD . SO DO YOU THINK MAYBE IT 'S DONALD ? WHY NOW ? HOW WOULD HE EVEN KNOW THAT WE 'RE STILL ALIVE ? WELL , HE LEFT THE RADIO FOR WALTER FOR A REASON , AND HE LEFT IT ON THAT FREQUENCY FOR A REASON . MAYBE HE 'S TRYING TO CONTACT US . WELL , YEAH , HIM OR ANYBODY ELSE WITH A SHORTWAVE RADIO . THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE IS TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT MESSAGE IS . WALTER . WALTER ? DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS ?

WHAT KIND OF ACID DID YOU TAKE ? BLACK BLOTTER . I FOUND SOME HIDDEN IN THE STOREROOM . WHY ? BECAUSE IT WAS AN EXCELLENT BATCH . NO , WHY DID YOU DROP ACID ? I 'M DESPERATE TO REMEMBER THE PLAN BEFORE HE COMPLETELY TAKES OVER . WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT , WALTER ? NINA AND I MADE AN ARRANGEMENT . WHAT KIND OF ARRANGEMENT ? SHE PROMISED THAT WHEN I FINISHED THE PLAN TO DEFEAT THE OBSERVERS , SHE WOULD HELP ME REMOVE THE PIECES OF BRAIN THAT THEY PUT BACK IN . I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S A GOOD IDEA , WALTER . I DON 'T WANT TO LOSE YOU , PETER . I DON 'T WANT TO LOSE ANY OF YOU . AND YOU WON 'T , WALTER . I 'M RIGHT HERE . WE 'RE ALL RIGHT HERE TOGETHER . IT 'S NOT ENOUGH .

( Olivia ) WE DON 'T KNOW , BUT APPARENTLY , HE WAS HELPING TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION GOING . WELL , IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT SAM WEISS WAS DONALD ? I DON 'T THINK SO .

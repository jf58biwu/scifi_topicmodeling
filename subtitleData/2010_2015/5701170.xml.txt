 Your sister , she 's an incredibly dangerous woman ! What happened to Claire ? The music box , it infected her . It was destroyed , so we had no artifact to neutralize . The only solution was to put Claire in an artifact-induced coma . You 're my sister , and there 's no way I 'm leaving you like this . Make way ! Make way for their Royal Majesties ! Make way ! God save the Queen ! Hip hip huzzah ! Hip hip huzzah ! Greetings , Royal subjects and visitors from the future . The brave knight who triumphs in today 's tournament shall win my daughter 's hand in marriage . Let the festivities begin ! Huzzah ! Uh , you do know how juggling works , right ? No , man . You 're supposed to catch them . That 's the juggling part ! Oh , knave . Your fly is undone ! - Oh , loser ! - He 's awful . Oh , Forsooth ! Here 's another loser who vexes me ! Is he okay ? He 's having a heart attack ! Somebody call 911 ! You okay ? Mister ! Call 911 ! Don 't panic ! Don 't panic . I mean , we could say they 're cajun-style . Oh , my God . Tell me there 's cereal . When 's Abigail back from her trip ? Why ? She doesn 't cook either . No , but she orders in really well . The new Dark Vault is ready . You have my permission to come back to the Warehouse . The new Vault is marvelous . Say what you will about Paracelsus , but the man had a knack for security . I 've incorporated a few of his ideas , albeit it in a fashion more suitable to my beloved steampunk motif . I need a little help getting the artifacts moved back in . Oh ! We have a ping . - Oh , thank God . I 've been so bored . - Yes ! From a Renaissance Faire . - Not it . - No . N ... Tell me there 's something else behind door number two . No , but thanks for playing . Now wait a minute . Are you out of your mind ? Renaissance Faires are awesome , man . They 've got swords and wenches , and you can be a knight or a knave . Which one do you want to be , huh , knight or knave ? - I want to be a federal agent . - You 're already a federal agent . - Exactly . - All right . Well , I want to be a knave . You don 't know what a knave is , do you ? - It 's a good thing . - Uh-huh . Be a knave . Take the federal agent with you . Claudia and Myka can help me here . - Where is Claudia , by the way ? - Oh , you know what ? I 'm gonna go track her down , and we 'll meet you there . Excellent . Oh , tell me there 's cereal . - Spices , tea , home remedies . - Methinks not , Sir . Ooh , look ! Swords ! My God , this is everything I 've ever wanted . Okay , now it 's everything I 've ever wanted . - Wait , Jinksy , hold it ! - What , what ? - Costume rentals ! - No ! Come on , man ! You can be a knight ! Or not . Not is also an option . But , man , I thought Halloween was , like , gay Christmas . You don 't like costumes ? I 'm not a cliché . I-I don 't watch the Oscars either . Really ? Oh , maybe I 'm gay . - Tournament today , 3 : 00 ! - Federal agent . I need to speak with whoever 's in charge here . S 'wounds ! An officer of the court . - ' Tis an honor , Milord . - Yes , fine . Can you please just tell me who 's in charge ? T 'would be the King , Milord . Thee must seek a Royal audience . - Of course I must . - Cool . Follow me . Make way ! Make way for the officers of the court . Hello , Kingdom . Yes , ' tis my good fortune to be not only the sovereign of this fair county , but also its proprietor . - You own the faire ? - Forsooth ! - ' Tis so . - That 's awesome . Oh , well . Mayhaps Milords would fancy a round of darts or knucklebones ? Knucklebones ? That sounds like ... Like something that you can play later . Right after we play " tell the federal agents everything you know without the ' thees ' and the ' thous . ' " Okay . This way . Look , a Ren Faire is an interactive experience . And people come to play along , not just watch . I got to stay in character . It 's good for business . The faster you start talking , the faster you can put that crown back on . What about the Jester with the Scepter ? The one who made the heckler laugh ? - Who is he ? - And where can we find him ? I 've never seen the guy before . Plus he was wearing a mask ! How about a list of your employees ? Sure , but it won 't help . I mean , we got tons of Jesters . Half of ' em are paying customers , even , and the customers are the good ones . Well , there must be some way to narrow it down . - How many Jesters can there be ? - Look around . And that 's just the line to the John . Gadzooks . _ Told you I 'd be back . Let 's get started . Despite everything Artie told you , you 're here anyway . She 's my sister . I didn 't leave Joshua stuck in an inter-dimensional prison . I didn 't leave Steve dead , and I 'm not leaving Claire like this . Look , Claude , you know I just had a huge wake-up call , and life is shorter than you ever think . I can 't imagine mine without my sister . So what you 're saying is ... What 's the plan ? So since we don 't have the artifact that turned my sister into Carrie , we can 't neutralize it . And the artefact energy has still live somewhere , if you take it out of Claire ... We got to put it in something . Wait , you know that combining artifacts ... Is dangerous ? Yes . And you know that my sister has been in a coma for 15 years . I think a little danger is worth it , don 't you ? - Bob Dylan 's bus transfer . - That 's right . His transition from acoustic to electric marked a major change in his music . You know , it might not have been Dylan 's best move , but the uproar from his fans make this artifact ... Extremely dangerous ! And also very useful to what we are about to do right now . Okay , moving on . Alessandro Volta 's biscuit barrel . Volta invented the battery ... Which is a way to store the energy . So the bus ticket will transfer the energy from Claire into the biscuit barrel . - Nice . - Exactly . Please note that I did not say anything about how dangerous that could be . Okay , what do you need me to do ? Well , since Claire can 't hold on to the artifacts herself , we 've got to help her out . You take one hand , I 'll take the other ? These officers of the court would just like to ask you all a few questions . Nope , nada , nyet . That Jester that made the guy laugh , I just want to know if you 've seen him today . Not so , I 'faith , ne 'er e 'en then . - So would you recognize him ? - Good sir ! I shan 't recognize a knave under any circumstance . - Look , I just want to know if ... - Knave , dost thou know how many knights it takes to changeth a lightbulb ? - Stop that ! - Dude , not cool ! If you don 't answer my question , this puppet is gonna see parts of you that not even your doc ... Whoa ! Surely he jests , fair knave . Okay , guys . Let 's just chillax , shall we ? Look , we just want to know if you know anything about the Jester that made the heckler laugh . Not my shift . You guys ask Oswald ? Oswald ? No , who 's Oswald ? He was one of the guys onstage when it happened . So why wasn 't he here with all the other Jesters ? Oswald isn 't a real Jester . He was just filling in . - He 's a doofer . - A " doofer " ? You know , a guy who does things . Like , the doofer gets hit with the pie . He 's the target for the knife thrower , the prisoner in the dungeon . He shovels the horse ... Sure , we get it . He 's the doofer . Now , where can we find him ? Mm-mm-mm . - You little ... - I-I know . I know , walk away . I just ... Dunk a punk ! Douse a louse ! Soak a bloke , 10 shillings ! Step right up , Milords ! A mere 10 shillings . Oh , no , thank you , Milady . We just want to talk to your pal up there . Oh , nay , kind Sir . Thou cannot . Not until Milord hits the target . Well , Milord is happy to oblige . Thank you . All right . What 's so important ? You were onstage when the guy had the heart attack . Oh , yeah . Poor guy . Wait , wait . That wasn 't my fault , okay ? I-I didn 't make him laugh . I am never funny . - Ask anyone . - I think you 're funny . The doofer 's been dunked . Great . Hey , look , no one 's blaming you , okay ? We just want to know what happened . Ask one of the knights . I mean , ask the King . He was there . We already asked everybody else . Oh , of course , because the doofer is always the last one on the list . You know I was supposed to be a knight by now ? That 's what my contract says . I 'm sure they 'll make you a knight soon , Ozzie . That 's easy for you to say . You get bumped up to lady-in-waiting next week . I-I 've been a doofer for three seasons . It ... no , no . I need to talk to the King . You need to talk to us , okay ? We want to know what you saw . Hey , look out ! You stop the cart , and I 'll get the girl ! Pete , look out ! Myka , look . It 's working . Claude , just hold on . Mykes , her hand ! Is that it ? I don 't know . Bag ' em . Okay . Where am I ? Where the hell did it go ? Well , no evil Jesters , no laughing hecklers , but I 'm guessing " Mr. Toad 's Wild Chariot Ride " has got to be related , right ? 'Tis all part of the spectacle ! Oh , forsooth . 'Tis the grandest entertainment in the land . Maybe we should shut this place down . No , we can 't . Whoever has the artifact will go home . We 'd never find ' em . What the hell was that ? I don 't have to tell you how bad this is for business . It 's very , very bad . A round of knucklebones for all ! Huzzah ! Come on , will you help me out here , boys ? Uh ... Milords , Miladies , gather round ! We know a guy with a Renaissance Grudge - against his Lordship . - Bad for business has got to be at the top of our disgruntled doofer 's to-do list . I don 't understand . Where am I ? You 're at a hospital , a special hospital . Who are you ladies ? Well , my name is Myka , and , um , this is ... Uh ... I 'm Claudia . I 'm your sister . No , you 're not . My sister 's seven years old . Um , listen , there was ... There was a car accident , and you 've been in a coma for a really long time . A coma ? Cars ? But that was ... no way . Come on . I don 't believe you . I don 't . I-I know . It sounds insane . Yes , because it is insane . No , see ? That is Claudia . See ? And I 'm ... old . Oh , my God . I 'm old . You 're not old . You 're just ... you 're older . How much older ? I ... 15 years . 15 years ? - That means you 're ... - 22 . So I 'm 30 ? I 'm 30 years old ? - How can I be 30 years old ? - Don 't worry ! We 're gonna get everything sorted out , okay ? I promise . Everything is gonna be all right . I missed the Garbage Concert . I missed the prom ! I missed graduation ! - How is this gonna be all right ? - Just trust me , okay ? We 're gonna talk everything through from the very beginning . Just give me one sec . I have a feeling this is maybe gonna take a while . Yeah , I 'm just gonna put these back where they belong . Thank you . And , hey , um , Artie might be not so happy about this . You think you could soften him up a bit before we get there ? Don 't worry about it . I 'll take care of Artie . Okay , Catarina , we 're looking for your pal Oswald . - Um ... - Target practice , look . Another one ? You get the wizard , I 'll take care of the crowd ! Hey , get down ! Hey , get back ! Hey ! Okay , neat trick . Now what the hell ? Coming , princess ! Okay , okay . There you go . There you go , there you go . Ah , some special effects ! Wow , best Ren Faire ever ! There you go . Not all on fire . I used to like magic . Not a Mark on her ! What a show , huh ? Ho-ho-ho . Huh ? Come on . Let 's hear it for King what 's-his-name . Hey , not so fast there , Ozzie Ozbean . What do you want me for ? Look , I-I ... I 've never played a magician , and I 'm not even on the clock , okay ? That may be so , but wherever you are , chaos seems to follow . Time to grill the doofus . And , um , I get a free room here at the bed and breakfast , although it 's not so much breakfast anymore , so ... You got a lot of stuff . Oh , God , yeah . God , I guess I do . Um , I didn 't have very much when I came here , so I ... I don 't know , maybe I 'm just trying to make up for that . Mm . What 's this ? Oh , this is ... um , iPad . It 's like a little computer . You can listen to music or read books or surf the Internet on it . Mm . The Internet 's still around ? Dad said that 'd be a passing fad . Yeah , well , he probably didn 't think pants were here to stay either . Uh , that 's for an Xbox . - Uh , video games . - Oh , like , um , Donkey Kong . Yeah , except nobody plays Do ... Yeah , just like Donkey Kong . I got to say , I 'm really hating this . And I totally get that . I-I just ... Nothing feels real . Wait , that 's it , isn 't it ? It 's a dream . It 's just a weird dream . I 'm just gonna wake up and be me again . Claire , I 'm sorry . It 's not a dream . It has to be . It has to be ! This cannot be my life ! Look , it 's ... it 's okay . Everything is gonna be all right . Please stop saying it 's gonna be all right , ' cause it 's not . None of this is all right . I don 't recognize anything or anyone ! Claire , I 'm sorry . You 're right , it 's a lot . It 's a lot to take in , but you 're gonna catch up fast . You know why ? ' Cause I did . What , you were in a coma too ? I was in a mental institution . You were ? Why ? Long , long story , but I spent my formative years in a psych ward , and not to outdo you , but crazy girl carries a lot more stigma than coma girl . Oh . Look , yes , maybe there are some things you can 't get back like the prom or the Garbage Concert , but we 'll catch you up on everything else , I promise . Besides , I hear high school 's overrated . I don 't think we missed much avoiding all that teen drama . Wait . Is this ... Your guitar ? Yeah , my strongest memories of you are with that guitar , which probably has a lot to do with why I 'm completely guitar-obsessed . Yeah , you are . Hey , do you want to see where I play ? Okay . Okay . Alice ? Are you in there ? Wha ... okay . Yeah , ju ... sorry . Just go back to planning ways to kill me . - So what 's the plan ? - Don 't do that ! Artie , do not start with me . Took you long enough . Where 's Claudia ? She 's busy . You and I can handle this . There was a time when people actually did what I said . Oh , boo-hoo . What is the plan ? All right . We are going to carefully load all these artifacts back into the newly secured Dark Vault very , - very , very carefully . - Got it . Okay , listen , Artie . I need to , um , ease you into something . Did you not hear me say " very , very carefully " ? Everything here ... everything ... Is extremely unstable . It is critical that no negative energy ... This is not my first time in the Dark Vault ! - Shh , shh . - Although " Vault " is a joke . Okay , this place is about as secure as a kiosk at the mall . Don 't ... And how many times has Alice escaped from that mirror anyway ? Which is why I have been working night and day to install new security measures . Doesn 't anybody ever listen to me ? Do not snap at me , okay ? You said you didn 't want any help with that ! Aah ! No . J ... no negative energy now . I don 't know what 's making all these things happen . And yet you 're always there when they do . - Wha ... - I don 't know . Maybe it 's aimed at him ? Do you have any enemies ? Anybody that might want to hurt you ? No , look , look , I am just trying to get through my already humiliating day . All right , well , let 's start with the juggling . Tell us everything you did or touched leading up to the Jester 's performance . I-I did everything that I normally do . All the usual stuff , except getting my fortune told . You don 't usually get your fortune told ? Oh , my God . The fortune teller ? Is tha ... did she curse me ? Am I doing all of this with my mind ? Well , stranger things have happened . - What 'd she say to you ? - Madame Dooriya ? Uh , she ... she asked me what I wanted , you know ? What ... what would make me happy . I want to become a knight , and I want to win the hand of the princess . I mean , not just the job thing ... I mean , I actually want to go out with the girl who plays the princess . You are not a hero . To become a knight and win the hand of the princess , you must become a hero . Okay . How ? The cards will show the way . All right , well , let 's see what else Madame Dooriya has to say . Wow . How many bags did we bring ? Madame D really wouldn 't like this . No , she really , really wouldn 't . All right , lady , secret service . We know you put a curse on this fine young man right here , and we want you to hand over whatever it is you used to do it . I haven 't cursed anyone in years . Not since my ex-husband . Ribbit , ribbit . I didn 't even read the cards for this one . Yes , she did . Pete , look . Oh . Let 's bag ' em . - You ready , Jinksy ? - Mmhmm . Damn it , nothing . We got a gypsy on the run ! Knight to B4 ! Wow ! Halt ! Depart the board ! You know they 're just using you , right ? Steve , go around that way and flank her . Look out ! The white queen ! Okay , this thing 's just broken . Hey , it 's time travel day ! Steve , she 's behind you ! Oh ! Lady just disappeared . So did Madame Dooriya . - That was awesome . - Best Ren Faire ever ! - Okay , keep it . - Thanks . Wow , how did coffee get to be so expensive ? Oh , I have no explanation for that . So , you know , it 's not exactly the viper room , but the crowd is always enthusiastic ... Although , in fairness , that might be the caffeine . It 's very cool . Weren 't you nervous to play in front of people ? Yeah , definitely , but you know , Pete kind of talked me into it , and then after that first night , when they all clapped , let 's just say I 'm addicted to more than just coffee . Would you play for me ? Twist my arm . But , hey , you 've got to sing with me . Oh , I 've been in a coma for 15 years . I 'm pretty sure I 'm rusty . And I can guarantee you rolling stone is not here to review us . Oh , thank God rolling stone 's still around . Okay . ♪ Ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba , ba ♪ ♪ Ba , ba , ba , ba ♪ - Wait .

My keen sense of perception is giving me the impression that you are upset . - What is wrong ? - What 's wrong , Artie ? Everything ! Look , just ... Calmly , calmly , just ... You see , there 's an energy balance in here that ... - Don 't patronize me , Artie . - Patronize you ? Liste ... My bad . Look , why don 't we just quietly work together ? You also never mentioned that we would be stuck in South Dakota forever , and you never , ever , ever told us that we would be affected by artifacts ! You want to guess how many times I 've been whammied ? That 's what this is about . You think that somehow an artifact has affected your health . Stop second-guessing me , Artie . That is not what this is about ... Not at all ! Myka , you 've been whammied again . I hate it here ! Not so fast ! Damn it ! I 'm getting old . I used to be faster than The KGB . So this is why you ran out on us ? You were jonesing for a corn dog ? Which I would totally get , by the way . They 're awesome . Why are you harassing my grandmother ? She didn 't do anything wrong . That 's right . You did ! Idiot girl , you used Mother Shipton 's cards on that doofus . - It 's doofer . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . You ? I-I thought you liked the doofus . - Oswald . - You do ? You like me ? Like , like like me ? So then why curse him ? He could have been hurt . I know , and I 'm so sorry . It was an accident . I was ... I didn 't mean for anyone to get hurt . I was just trying to help Ozzie . I wanted him to show the courage that I know he has so he could become a knight . So , when he came into the tent , I pretended to be Dooriya . I didn 't know it was gonna be dangerous . Of course it 's dangerous ! Idiot girl ! Mother Shipton created tragedy across all of England . Well , then let 's make sure those cards don 't cause any more . All right , watch your eyes . Nice trick . All right , now that we know Ozzie 's off the hook , how about some corn dogs ? No , wait ! This cannot be stopped . The cards have been dealt . They foretold that the doofus will become a hero , so become a hero he must or die trying . I usually get paid for this kind of information . " Die " ? Did she say " die " ? Like , die die ? - Yes , die ! - Die ! No one 's gonna die , okay ? We 're gonna fix this . Steve , why don 't you help Oswald pick out a nice hat . Let 's go buy a hat . Does he really have to die ? Either he 's a hero or a dead doofus . Okay , so how do we fix this ? Oswald is the only one who can fix it . - He must become ... - A hero , right ... As you said . Is there any other way ? Or he could die ! Would you stop saying that ? The cards are presenting Oswald with opportunities . He should have been the one to call 911 or to rescue that little girl ... Or kept Steve out of checkmate . He could be a hero . I know he can . Really ? Have you seen him ? I mean , really looked at him ? Well , she has a point . No matter . The cards will continue to challenge him until he does . All right , well , I guess it 's time for Oswald to knight up . His goal is to win the princess , and to do that , he has to win the tournament today . So the cards will probably challenge him there . The time ... I must go . I have an exorcism in 20 minutes . Okay , explain something to me . If you really like this guy , why would you help him win the princess ? Because when you really love someone , you want them to be happy , even if it isn 't with you . Wow . My ex-girlfriends had more of ... A scorched-earth policy . Don 't let anything happen to him ? Don 't worry . I 'm on it . Now that I know where and when , I 'll make sure the odds are stacked in his favor . Good , because the last card that I dealt him ... Was " death . " Myka , please . Don 't , don 't ! No . No ! Talking down to me does not help ! Look , I 'm not talking down to you . I 'm just talking you down . See the difference ? See , all this rage ... don 't ! Oh , oh ! All this rage is just 'cause you 've been whammied . It 's not just that . That 's right . - It 's everything . - Right . - It 's this place . - Uh-huh . - It 's a thousand things . - I understand . Do you know that I went through my cancer scare alone ? - Uh , yeah . - Do you know that ? - I 'm sure . - Alone ! Yes , I know . And ... and you didn 't really need to . You ... you chose to keep it to yourself , see ? And what if I spend the rest of my life alone ? Is that my fault too ? Is that what you 're saying ? Answer the question ! Oh , my God . The music box . Unh . You shot me ? Well , it wasn 't really a shot , per se ... More like an aggressive hello . You shot me ! It just makes me angrier ! Oy yay , oy yay , oy yay ! Gather round ! 'Tis time for the Royal tournament to begin ! - No , no , no , I can 't . - Oh , yeah . I-I can 't . I can 't . I can 't . - Yes , you can . - No . - There you go . Attaboy . - Uh-oh . How ? With clear eyes and a full heart ... You can 't lose . I 'm nearsighted , and I have arrhythmia . Look , dude , you can do this , okay ? You have to . Otherwise they 're just gonna keep coming , and you don 't want to be chased your whole life , do you , huh ? All you have to do is beat this last card . How bad can it be ? Well , you had to ask . Who challenges me ? - You ? - Me ? Oh , him . - Prepare to die , mortal ! - No , no , no , no , no , no ! He 's got to do this himself . Whoa , whoa . No , I can 't do this . No , no , no , you 're doing it ! - I can 't ... - Ozzie , you 're good . You 're doing great . Keep him in the game , okay ? I got an idea . - Hey , no ! - I can 't . You 're a knight now . Use your sword . Aah ! Here , catch ! Ozzie , here ! Unh ! Ozzie , look out ! Nothing is worth this , not even the princess ! - Hey , where you going ? - Coward ! Leave me alone ! Catarina ! I 'll take you instead . No ! Huzzah ! Hip-hip , huzzah ! Hip-hip , huzzah ! We did it . ♪ I don 't want to fall asleep ♪ ♪ ' Cause I miss you , babe ♪ ♪ And I don 't want to miss a thing ♪ Oh , I don 't . I don 't want to miss a thing . Will you tell me everything that happened while I was sleeping ? Ooh ! Well , that could take a minute . We need snacks . Okay . Mom and dad must be so proud of you . Claire ... Um ... Listen , mom and dad ... Mom and dad aren 't with us anymore . What do you mean ? They 're gone . They were ... They were in the car accident that put you in a coma . They were ? - Claire , please ! - No ! The car ? That car . They 're dead ? I 'm starting to remember . I 'm so sorry . I know I should have told you sooner . - I just ... I-I didn 't know ... - But I wasn 't . I saw it . I saw the crash ... So I couldn 't ha ... I wasn 't in the car , was I ? No ... You weren 't . You ... it 's ... It 's very complicated . I-I ... Yep ? Is your sister there with you right now ? Great . Myka told you . Yeah , listen , everything 's okay . No ... Actually , it isn 't ! Don 't defend him . He shot me ! Guys , get back ! Oh . I 'm sorry . I 'm really , really , really sorry , really ! I just ... I thought that ... Bob Dylan 's bus transfer ? Volta 's biscuit barrel ? You think I didn 't already think of that ? Look , the music box does not work that way . Ooh ! Look , the energy has to be transferred into a living human being . If you 'd only asked me , I wo ... Can 't we just Tesla her ? In addition to the strong possibility that Myka might be extremely upset by being shot again , there 's also the issue of the energy from the Tesla boosting her telekinetic energy , so ... So , what , then ? Catch , Artie ! Oh , it 's not Artie . It 's me . Hi . Just giving Claire the grand tour . Want to help ? Nobody knows the stacks like Myka . You remember Claire , right ? Hey , again , Myka . - Hello , Claire . - Nice of you to drop in . I 'm sorry , Myka . Oh ! We only have a few minutes and not many options . Well , you 're not gonna put Myka in a coma , Artie . You can 't . Claudia , not her ... Me . He has to , don 't you ? Seeing her like that , I remember now . I remember everything ... The music box , how angry I could get , mom and dad . It wasn 't your fault . I know . I know . But somebody has to do it ... Not Myka ! No , no , I 'm not gonna let you go back to that . - There has to be something . - No , but there 's not ! You 've tried everything , haven 't you ? For 15 years . I 'm sorry , Claire . - It 's okay . - No . No ! I was there too . I knew the music box was dangerous . - Put me in the coma . - No , Claudia . I will not let you or Myka or anyone else suffer . Listen to me . Thank you for today . If I only get one day , I am so , so glad I got this one . I love you , little sister , and I am counting on you to fix all of this . We have to do this now . Okay . Wait . ♪ When I grow up ♪ ♪ I 'll be stable ♪ ♪ When I grow up ♪ ♪ I 'll turn the tables ♪ I 'll find a way . I promise . All right . Yeah . I now pronounce thee Sir Oswald , The Lionheart . Huzzah ! And offer thee my fair daughter 's hand in marriage . Uh , gramercy , your Majesty . It pains me greatly , but I must decline . Verily , my heart belongs to another . You knew , didn 't you ? You knew that Oswald would save her , so you told Catarina to run in the ring . Well , Jinksy , my friend , I had a feeling that Ozzie could be a hero for someone he really cared about . Oh , look , someone got left out . Can 't let that happen , now , can we ? Mm-hmm . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , uh , I don 't know if you doth realize it or not , but , uh , I was pretty helpfull with Yon Knight over there . Ooh . - Yeah , well . - That 's so exciting . You want to go get a chai latte ? - I wanted to show you this . - What is this ? Claire . It 's all about Claire . Yeah . Like I said , I 've been working on her problem for the last 15 years . I 'm sorry , Claudia . I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about Claire ... Sooner . I didn 't want you to go through all that pain . I 've always done ... I always will do anything to keep you from getting hurt . Please don 't hug me . The only thing that could make this worse is you seeing me cry . Okay , from now on , we do everything together . That goes for you too . We 're a family here , and none of us has to go through anything alone ... Ever . Damn it .

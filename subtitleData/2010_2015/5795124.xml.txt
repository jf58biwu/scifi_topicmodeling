 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Julia , let go of the rope ! I got you . Julia , I can 't hold it ! ( julia screams ) And that cliff and barbie going down there Was all part of the dome 's plan ? A plan for what ? I waited outside that school , I saw you leave with barbie . He never left , So where is he ? And do not ... Lie to me again . Barbie 's dead . You need to see this . I think it 's a playground . Where ? Norrie : The obelisk . ( gasps ) ( panting ) Sam : There 's something you should know : Melanie 's alive . Dale ? Oh , my god , it is you . Hi , dad . I need to get a message to somebody on the inside . Who ? Obviously it does , or you wouldn 't be here . ( big jim panting ) ( sighs ) ( car door closes ) You 're up early . Comes with the new job . I wanted to give you that . What 's this for ? Safety . I-I found a bunch of them I just wanted to give them out to ... You know , key people At key locations . You 're our resident scientist . Mm-hmm . And ... Who do I call if someone , say , uh ... Breaks into my house ? I 'm sorry about that . I really am . I ... I-I-I-I can 't explain it . I-I just ... I got overzealous . ( laughs ) That 's what you call it , huh ? I really am sorry . So , you 're planning on keeping that star , huh ? Yeah . The dome hasn 't treated those who wear it Too kindly . ( scoffs ) I know . It 's just , I-I-I feel like the ... The dome has something else In store for me . I 've just been too lucky To ignore it any longer , you know ? This " new " Big jim ... You 're serious ? I 'm trying to be . ( clicks tongue ) Well , keep that on channel two And just give me a call If you have any problems . Jim ? Yeah . Thank you . You 're welcome . ( keyboard clicking ) ( knocking on door ) Hey , morning , dale . Morning . You , uh ... Figured out a way To get me to the dome yet ? ( sighs ) : That 's a pretty tall order , son , But I 'm still working on it . But I can get an e-mail to julia If you want . You can do that ? I made some calls To my friends in the military . Days ago , when the dome went white The signal was able to get through . But then they firewalled it . Yeah , but they 'll drop it for me . Privilege has its perks . Yep . ( sighs ) Why don 't you write down what you want to say And where you want to send it . ( murmuring ) ( clicks pen ) ( sighs ) " julia , I love you . " we 'll see each other soon . All it takes is a leap of faith " ? ( sighs ) yeah . I 'm just trying to Keep her spirits up . And this is the address you want to send it to : " scarecrowjoe " ? Is that hers ? No . It 's a , that 's a kid that she 's friends with . He 's ... Kind of a computer nerd , But he 's got the best chance of Seeing anything come through . Julia must be pretty special To have so many people looking out for her . Thank you , dad . Am I in focus yet ? Why are you trying to break your neck ? First rule of show business : Got to open big . Ta-da ! Welcome to my vlog . Video blog . Is there , like , a Chester 's mill film festival No . It 's so everybody will know what it 's like Living inside this stupid dome . Because we don 't have a wi-fi signal anymore . Maybe somebody will find it one day , Long after we 're gone . Joe , don 't say that . But you don 't have to be so morbid about it . Oh , because that 's what you do . Just tell me where we 're going . We 're going to the tunnel underneath the school . That connects to a playground . Yeah . Which is super weird . But you 're with me , right ? As long as you don 't do any more gymnastics moves While we 're down there . ( chuckles ) ( phone beeping ) What was that ? It was my phone . ( gasps ) Oh , my god . The signal 's back and there 's an e-mail . You need to eat , julia . I can 't . I was up all night thinking about barbie . Julia , you 'll never believe this . He 's right , I barely did . Okay , so , we were at the school filming a vlog ... I-I know , I know there 's no way to send them out , But I , I still make them so people will know . Out of nowhere , This wi-fi signal came back and ... Barbie sent you an e-mail . What ? Can you believe it ? We thought he was dead And now he could be alive . And he sent me an e-mail ? Well , he sent it to me , but It was for you . ( sighs ) " julia , I love you . " we 'll see each other soon . " all it takes is a leap of faith . " so get the egg and bring it with you . Barbie . " Why aren 't you more excited ? Yeah . Going over that cliff Must be the way out of chester 's mill . How do we even know that it 's him ? He doesn 't say anything to prove that it is . Where the hell is he ? The egg showed us zenith last night . Maybe that 's where the cliff leads . Norrie : Julia , why are you doubting this ? I would be doing cartwheels if I was you . ¶ ¶ Joe , can we send a reply ? I don 't know if the signal 's still up at the school . As soon as we got it , we ran here . Okay . Let 's go . ( wheelchair squeaking ) It 's in the cards . It 's in the cards . It 's in the cards . It 's in the cards . Yesterday he was saying " melanie " over and over again . It 's in the cards . Today , " it 's in the cards . " It 's in the cards . What does it mean ? Good luck finding out . Uh ... Are you going somewhere ? Anywhere . No , you cannot leave ! Pauline , I got out of chester 's mill . This is my chance to start my life over . You can come with me . No , not until I get junior out . We have got to go in there and help him . What ? That 's crazy . Don 't call me that . What I mean is , I don 't know how I got here . One minute I 'm next to a cliff Underneath chester 's mill and the next , I 'm lying in a playground here . I looked around for a door , a passageway- - nothing . Well , if you got out , there 's got to be a way in . Maybe he knows . Lyle doesn 't even know his own name . And there are doctors here that are helping patients With a new drug ; it 's experimental . I asked them to try it on lyle , But they said he doesn 't fit the protocol . So , end of story . You 're an emt , You can find a way to give it to him . I know you love junior . We have got to get him out . ( birds chirping , children giggling ) Hey , what are you doing ? I 'm wondering the same thing myself . Nah , I 'm just waiting here , Hoping a friend shows up to meet me . ( computer beeping ) ( keyboard and mouse clicking ) ( keyboard clicking ) Is that ... ? ( keyboard rapidly clicking ) ( sighs ) ( clicking continues ) ( keyboard and mouse rapidly clicking ) ( softly chuckles ) ( whispers ) : Got you . ¶ ¶ ( panting ) Is this your first time tailing someone ? Actually , yeah . Yeah , it shows . Who are you ? All that matters is who you are : Dale barbara , Born July 17 , 1979 ; third in your class at zenith high ; Joined the army November 2005 , Captain , 5th group , special forces ... You got the wrong guy . You also just escaped from the dome . Man , I don 't know what the hell you 're talking about . You can be damn sure other people know , too . Like who ? Your dad . What 's he got to do with this ? He doctored your e-mail to julia . Told her to bring the egg when she took her leap of faith . Tell me who the hell you are . Look , would you ease up ? I 'm a friend . I don 't have any . You need one . Well , it ain 't gonna be you . Well , I 'd think twice about heading back to that playground . There are eyes everywhere in this city . How do you know about that e-mail ? Let me show you . Did you find a signal yet ? No . But this is where you were when the e-mail came through ? Yeah , right about here . Well , right about here or right here ? You have to know exactly , joe ! Y-yeah , right here . But ... The signal 's gone . I 'm sorry . Yeah . Me , too . The man I love is dead . Go over that cliff . And now I 'm just supposed to believe That he 's somehow alive ? He said to take a leap of faith . That must mean it 's safe for you to jump off that cliff . I don 't even know that it 's him . If it is , I 'll do whatever he wants . You 'd even take the egg ? I 'd jump in a second . I 'd do anything to see my parents , Let ' em know I 'm okay . Tell ' em about angie . Joe , we all want to get out of here . Just listen to julia . We have to get an e-mail back . We have to make sure it 's barbie . There 's no signal . ( sighs ) Maybe we can get him a note . If that cliff is really the way out of here , He will be waiting wherever it leads . Like a message in a bottle . With a question That only he can answer . So figure out what you want to say to him . Art room . Judy 's having a seizure . She needs help . This is a police-only area . Whatever councilmen do , they do upstairs . I 'm no longer a councilman . You 're joking . If I was joking , one of us would be laughing . Isn 't being sheriff a little low on the totem pole for you ? Look , protection of this town Has always been my first priority . Now that barbie 's gone , someone has to wear the star . I just , uh , Hope I can live up to it . Still a politician at heart . No , I 'm not . Things are different . The dome has revealed it has plans for me . So now you think The dome speaks to people ? I 'm sorry I didn 't believe you when you said it , son . I-if I 'd understood , you know , everything , Maybe I could 've even protected angle . Don 't use her to sell me on this . Look , I 'm just saying , I have made mistakes . I should 've put my trust in family first and foremost . I should 've trusted you , son . Rebecca : Big jim , you there ? Yeah , rebecca . What ? Not sure exactly , But we got a problem at the sweetbriar . Police need to see this . Okay , be right there . Why don 't you hold down the fort While I go check this out . Why don 't I come with you , Show the department 's new employee the ropes . After you . What 's going on ? What can we do for you ? What 's going on , rebecca ? I went to check on the windmill , And someone had cut it down . I kept searching for it and ... Found it here . ( sighs ) Who the hell would destroy this thing ? Especially after it saved us all from choking to death A few days ago . I guess someone 's trying to send me a message . Not everything 's about you , dad . Well , it 's got to mean something . ( walkie chirps ) Grinnell : Hello , police ? Uh , yeah , it 's junior . What 's-what 's going on ? There 's a fire at maple and thornton . We need help . Be there in a sec . You in , barbie ? Yeah , I 'm in . And , hey , if this is a setup , you 're gonna have A hell of a time picking up your teeth with broken fingers . Just get to his computer and put in the jump drive . It 's password-protected . Put in the jump drive . All right , house security makes their rounds every two minutes . How long is this gonna take ? About that long . I take it You 're not in gardening . Technically , I 'm in computing . But don 't worry . I fight The good fight . Now open a browser Haven 't I seen that graffiti around town ? Well , it 's my web site to tell the world it 's being lied to About the dome . Okay , I 'm there . And you see that box up top ? Uh-huh . Type in the code " dromas . " Dromas . Uh ... I-I think I might 've screwed something up . Nope . Go ahead and take the jump out . I 'll take it from here . ( keys clacking ) Here 's the real e-mail Your father sent her . " julia , I love you . We 'll see each other soon . " all it takes is a leap of faith . " so get the egg And bring it with you . " Oh , my god . Now do you believe me ? What does my dad want with the egg ? Yeah , what is that thing ? I can 't let julia jump . What are you doing ? It 's not every day I get a backstage pass Like this . No , no . That 's it . I-I 've got everything that I needed . Relax , barbie . We 're done . Get out of there . What the hell ? Don : I could ask you The same thing . Hey , dad . Stall him . Son , what are Nothing . I was just trying to check my e-mail , see If julia replied , but ... I couldn 't log in . Well , She wouldn 't have replied . Yeah , no , I know , with the ... Military firewall . But ... I don 't know , I was just hoping there was a chance . Aw , look at this . This photo . I love this photo of mom . But where-where was this taken ? At the lake house . On our anniversary . Right . Come on . Come on . Yeah , see ? Like I said , Wouldn 't let me log in . I just wish There was a way I could get her another message . ( sighs ) dale . I need you to come with me . ( whooshing ) I was stepping out to get some supplies for the diner And spotted the car wild with fire . Thank god you gave me this walkie . Yeah , you did a good job , andrea . Thanks . We 'll take it from here . Rebecca : People in this town are losing it . Or someone 's on a vandalism spree . You 're still not seeing the pattern ? First they hit the windmill that I put up . Now under a sign for my dealership . They torch a car . A car that I sold . You 've sold two-thirds of the cars in town . It 's not a coincidence , son . Rebecca : Technically , two events Are a coincidence . It takes three to make a pattern . Well , I 'm not gonna wait till that 's my head on a platter . This is the only lead we got . Follow it . I haven 't been here in a while . The company 's grown a lot . I haven 't been entirely truthful with you . About ? The message you had me send to julia . It went to her but not through the military . It came from here . Aktaion energy has other divisions . Satellite imaging , telecommunications . You 're a government contractor . After the dome came down , We were hired to monitor radiation levels . But we were the first to discover a way To get a wi-fi signal into the dome . Which you then shared with your friends in the military . For a healthy profit . But we kept a backdoor as a way to be able to use it ourselves . That can 't be legal . No , which is why It was a huge risk for us to send that message . And the one we 're about to send . Oh . He 's not here . Yes , I am , sir . Oh . Well , hunter may , Meet my son , dale . How are you ? ( clears throat ) uh , likewise . Hunter , we need you To work your magic , send one more message into the dome . Dale will dictate it to you . All righty . ( grunts ) Well , fire when ready . ( keys clacking ) What did you decide to ask him ? If he remembers who he caught going through his stuff at home A few days ago . That was me . And only the three of us know about it . Okay ... Wrap your note around this . What is this ? It 's a paperweight big jim used to give out with every used car . My dad hated it almost as much as the lemon jim sold him . It 'll take your note straight through Whatever the hell is down there , And it 'll also prove to barbie that it 's actually From chester 's mill . All right . Next stop ... Barbie . Hopefully . ( phone chimes ) Wait , Wait- - the signal 's back . Barbie sent you another e-mail . " julia , hang in there . " whenever you get scared , " just remember the first time we kissed " at the dome by " joe 's house , at sunset , the stars coming out . " I can 't wait to hold you there again . Love , your stray . " He 's alive . Quick , let 's write something back . The signal 's lost . It doesn 't matter- - He 's alive . So you 're gonna jump ? No . He doesn 't want me to . He wants to meet face-to-face . How do you know that ? He proved it was him By signing it " your stray . " I called him that once . The thing about the first kiss ? Wrong place , wrong time ... Wrong weather . " at the dome by joe 's house , At sunset , the stars coming out . " Yeah , it was actually in the middle of town , Late at night , in the pouring rain . Hmm . The dude does have some romance in him . But why be so mysterious ? Maybe he has to be . Maybe wherever he is , Someone 's watching him . It 's worth a shot going out there . I 'm going alone . But We want to see him . And we should be with you . I know , but we don 't know if it 's safe . It 's just something I need to do by myself . ( softly groaning ) I 'm still not sure we should do this . Sam , I know you don 't like him , But I have to find out If he knows a way back into chester 's mill . Okay . But if he has a bad reaction , Or I don 't get the dosage exactly right ... This is no way for anyone to live . ( murmuring ) But don 't get a good lather with it If it 's that dry , and it won 't raise the beard . All right , pal . If the soap 's dry And you-you won 't get a lather And you raise that beard , you ... It 's not gonna ... Not gonna be clean . I 'm gonna give you a little something to help you out . Mona don 't want to use ... Uh , mona don 't want to use ... If you ... Ow . That hurt . Now what ? Now we wait . ( sighs ) Dude , this is getting old . Why didn 't you say you worked for my dad ? Yo , baby steps . You 're wound kind of tight . ( grunts ) Did he know you found me earlier ? No . That 's between us . I swear . How long you worked here ? Ever since they caught me sneaking into their server Two years ago , finding out stuff they didn 't want anyone to know . So they co-opted you . It was that or get tossed to the feds . So now I 'm on the payroll , securing their system Against people like me . Hey , Since we 're opening up , How the hell did you get out of that dome ? And you never answered my question- - why is your old man Obsessed with that egg ? Hey , shh . You talk way too much . You say you 're my friend , right ? Well , now you 're gonna get a chance to prove that . You 're gonna get me to the dome . The place where the national guard Shoots trespassers on sight ? Yeah . And you 're gonna do it or the military 's gonna find out That you 've been breaking through their firewall . Barbie , certain things are more difficult to accomplish Than others . Like my dad said , work your magic . So , what- - you 're just gonna hole up here Till we catch whoever did this ? No . I 'm not lying low for anyone . So , who do you think could be mad at you ? This could take a while . Well ... Not gonna lie to you . Some people in this town aren 't my biggest fans . Like ? Well , there 's roger lopez . Mm-hmm . When the windmill went up , he was Not happy that I wouldn 't let him run the show . There 's tom tilden , Pissed ' cause we used his pigs for the flu virus . Eyeballed me pretty hard At barbie 's memorial . And there 's phil bushey . Who 's lying in the clinic with a gunshot wound to his chest . More likely it 's terry donahue . Or his brother al . Neither one of them ever really liked me . And there 's , uh , there 's larry mccall . Yeah . Right before the dome came down , he was , uh , Really in my face about repo-ing his car . That can 't be everyone . Well , it 's a start . Great . You talk to those people And we 'll talk to these . These protesters you can see behind me Have been camped out now for over a week . They 're now Asking questions , doing anything they can to get an answer About their loved ones That are currently trapped under this dome . Hey . Just crazier by the day , huh ? Identification . Michael bryant . Aktaion radiation specialist . That 's me . Thumb scan . Right . Now you 're clear . Thank you . Be safe , sir . Will do . Excuse me . How far is it to the dome ? 16 klicks . But a civilian like you needs an escort To go anywhere . Yeah , of course . What-what unit are you guys with ? Stick to your science . ( truck engine starts ) Pauline . Did the rapture come ? This is heaven , huh ? No , lyle . ( soft laugh ) You 're not dead . You 're alive . My god , how 'd you get in chester 's mill ? We 're not there . We 're in zenith . You got out of the dome two days ago . And sam got here yesterday . Oh . Nice seeing you , too . Oh . I ... I dreamed I was falling . Just falling and falling . That 's what you get when you jump off a cliff , Thinking it 'd bring the rapture . How did I survive ? W-where am I ? You 're in a hospital . You haven 't been yourself The last few days . A hospital ? Uh-uh . No . Okay , Lyle , lyle , lyle , calm down . Somewhere we can take him ? Yeah , yeah . I got to go . Yeah , let 's go . ( siren wails , stops ) Sorry to be so dramatic . Saw you driving by , wanted to check in . Sorry to hear about barbie . How you dealing ? I 'm dealing . Wanted to give you this . It 's , uh , part of my new safety initiative . You sheriff now ? Yeah , I sure am . Busy first day , too . Where you headed ? Joe 's house . Wasn 't that destroyed ? Yeah , he thinks there might be some food we can salvage . And I had to get out of the house . Mm . Well , be careful up there in all that mess . Thanks for the kind words . ( jet flies overhead ) Okay , I hate this . Yeah , me too . We 're the ones who got the e-mail . Yeah , and found the signal first . Well , this is different . How ? It 's about barbie . He 's our friend , too . I met him before anyone . Well , it 's about barbie and julia . Oh . Yeah . By the way , who knew barbie was so mushy ? That e-mail he sent her ... It 's called being romantic . Boys just don 't get it . Oh , right , I 'm talking to two girls Who probably loved the notebook . What 's the notebook ? Oh , my god . That e-mail that barbie sent julia was in code to get her To come to the outside of the dome by your house . So , someone must have been watching his every move . Yeah , exactly . Is he even gonna be able to get back ? He 'll have to travel past the military 's perimeter , And then travel who knows how far to the dome wall . There 's a lot of room for error . I just wish there was something we could do . I hate feeling so useless . Feeling better ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I think , uh-huh . Thank you . You , too . Well , now you 're back , which means I 'm out of here . What ? No , you can 't leave . I kept my end of the bargain . I still need your help . The three of us need to go to chester 's mill . What the hell for ? No , no . Pauline , it 's terrible there . I have to get my son out . And I think there are answers there for us . Answers to what ? To what 's been going on for the last 25 years . The dome is connected to what happened That night with melanie . You don 't know if That 's true . She came back from the dead , And we may be the only hope of getting people out . When you came back , you were mumbling " melanie " Over and over again . And then you started saying , " it 's in the cards . " Why ? I don 't know . Sam : Well , great . Then all of this was for nothing . No , it 's not for nothing . It means something . " it 's in the cards . " Yeah . No . The cards . When I went over the cliff , I had the postcards with me . Tom tilden . Junior rennie . Next time you see your dad , You tell him to go to hell for me . You seem angry . Hell , yes . Almost every pig I got is dead , thanks to big jim and her . We didn 't infect them with the flu . No . And then word gets out that me and my pigs are responsible . People hate my guts now . Where were you today , tom ? None of your damn business . No , actually , it is . You want to know where I 've been ? At sunup , I was at toot danver 's place , Delivering incubators I don 't need anymore . By 10 : 00 , I was at the cullin farm , Trading my mother 's heirloom quilts for food to feed my kids . Rebecca : And all these people Will confirm you were there ? Why wouldn 't they ? Now I 'm pawning this generator Off on burt bailey for whatever he 'll give me for it . You know , I used to admire your old man . Now I wouldn 't spit on him if he was on fire . ( quietly ) : Okay . You want to go check out his alibis ? Though I have a feeling he didn 't do it . Still , lot of hate for big jim in everyone we 've talked to . Yeah . We 'd better check on him . Dad , it 's me . Are you there ? You have any luck ? Not yet , junior . It 's gonna take a while . ( grunts ) Dad , Where are you ? Dad , answer me ! Where are you ? Is this your doing ? You cut us off from the rest of the world , Turn us against each other . Now you trick me into believing that barbie is coming back ? Is that what you 're doing ? Phil , what are you ... ? Let 's just say I 'm not supposed to be out of the clinic . And I 'm guessing that this is against doctor 's wishes , too . Hmm . Oh , no . You won 't be needing that anymore . That what this is about ? Your not being sheriff anymore ? 'cause it was julia and barbie that fired you , not me . Oh , come on , everybody knows that nothing happens In chester 's mill without the hidden hand of big jim rennie . If that were true , my hand would be hidden in your chest , Ripping your damn heart out . You got me to do the dirty work For your plan to burn up the people 's food . I was by your side , jim . And I took a bullet for you . I almost died because I trusted you . Well , I got the same problem , phil . Putting my trust in the wrong people . Luckily , today ... I found someone I could . ( phil grunting ) Key 's in the back pocket ! Okay . Okay . Come on . ( sighs ) ( rebecca and phil grunting ) ( big jim grunting ) ( phil grunts ) Get it . ( junior gasps ) ( sighs ) Hey ! ( grunting ) ( big jim sighs ) You okay ? Yeah . ( sighs ) Guess we can work together now . ( sniffles ) I guess we can . Give me the keys . Take the lady home , I 'll take care of phil . You sure ? Good job . ( sighs ) Come on , phil . Get up . Get in there . We 're never getting out of here alive . Yeah , we all got problems . These are the events that pauline foresaw In the order that I got them . Yeah . Yeah , but this isn 't The order in which they happened . First the dome came down . Then the missile strike . Then came the red rain . And the obelisk . Yeah , but that 's here in zenith . And this is the last card I got . So , these postcards don 't really Tell us anything we don 't know . There 's nothing that comes next . The obelisk wasn 't the last postcard that I drew . There was one more , but the dome came down Before I could send it . Red door . Why 'd you draw this , pauline ? I don 't know ... But we 'd better find it . ( crickets chirping ) ( panting ) ¶ ¶ ( helicopter blades whirring ) Get away from him ! Take your hands ... Don 't jump ! ... Off of him ! Leave him alone ! Barbie ! Don 't jump ! ( sighs ) ( barbie grunts ) Barbie ! ( panting ) Barbie ! Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

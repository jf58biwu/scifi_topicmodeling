 Sorry . Brian , slow down in the hallway ! Can 't , Ki . Gotta hustle . Got a telegram from my mom . Brian ! What 's the hurry ? I 'm meeting my mom at the bus stop . Are we still on for that thing later ? Yup , definitely . Hey , Brian . Are you excited for that thing later ? Oh crap ! That thing that was today ? I 've got another thing with Jenny . It 's , uh , FPS stuff . Oh . Do you wax the boogie boards ? Awesome . We 'll hang out tomorrow . My mom 's coming to VGHS , and I haven 't heard from her since I left for VGHS . Sounds boring . Well , it 's not . Cheeto ? Dude , your mom 's a cat ! Your mom 's a cat ! Practice . Time for practice . I thought we were practicing , but if you need more time to review ... But seriously , I 'm gonna go now , and in two and half minutes , you can come out . You 're kind of freakin ' out about this ? Freaking out ? I 'm not freaking out . You 're freaking ... Safety alarm . Ok , I 'm freaking out . Dude , chill . This is supposed to be fun . You 're right . I 'm sorry . I 'm just ... you 're mom can 't find out about us . Nobody can find out about us . This is for real now . I 'm just afraid I 'm gonna blow it . Brian , disarm the bomb ! It 's gonna blow . Are you serious , Brian ? You suck ! Can 't disarm a bomb . I can disarm a bomb . I can disarm two bombs . Sorry , guys . My bad . Bomb disarms are noob 101 , any pro should be able to do it blindfolded . Coach , I swear I can normally do this . On that uplifting note , that 's practice . Everyone 's dismissed . Jenny , stick around . So about Brian , what do you think ? I think he 's still in the room , mom . Not for long . I ... See ya when I see ya . Well , that was awkward . I wanna bench Brian tomorrow . Okay , why are you telling me ? You 're my captain . I wanna hear your opinion . Well , he 's one of the strongest players on our team . I wouldn 't bench him just because he couldn 't disarm one stupid bomb . Guys like Brian are all talent and no discipline . It shows up in stuff like this . One stupid bomb could make us lose the game tomorrow , you understand ? Yeah , it sounds like you made up your mind . I tell you what , you make the call . Bench him or not ? Just let me know by game time . Wendell , rule number five , " No sodas in the hallway . " Sorry . Wendell ! " No throwing trash in the hallways , " rule number 38 . It was an accident ? Unfortunately , I caught you with silly string earlier . That 's three infractions . You know what that means . Bathroom duty ? I 'm sorry , but rules are rules . " Number one RA " , snaps , Ki . Really , snaps . Though I think that " number two " would be more appropriate ! Oh my gosh ! Scooped this off your floor a couple a minutes ago . This isn 't just some normal poop that some students might leave . Oh no . This came from an animal . In fact , I 'm willing to bet it came from a ... What were we talking about ? No pets allowed , Ki . So , when I find that cat , you can say goodbye to " number one " because she 's coming over to my place . We 're moving in together . Me and one . Big step for our relationship . My friends say I 'm one-whipped , but I don 't care because I 'm ready to commit . Because I love number one . Thirty foot range . What the heck is wrong with you , Ted ? I 've been holding this track for hours . When do I get the toy car ? This is not a toy , Ted . This is a custom overdrift USB super car . What ? I want one even more now . DK , when do I get one ? Theodore , you 've been a drifter for nearly a fortmonth . Earning a super car is no small challenge . It 's only for super serious racers . Serious ? I stole soda for you guys . I beat The Duchess , and I built this boss track , and all my friends have one and I want one . Now . Very well , child . If you will not heed my warning , go grab a book from the bookshelf . Oh my god . I know you missed me because I missed you , too , buddy . Dad 's gotta go now to practice his stupid mini-game . A mini-game that if he messes up will ruin our entire season . I missed this . All right . Wish me luck . Brian , have you seen if ... that is ... a cat . You have a cat in your room . Oh , yeah . This is Cheeto , my best friend from home . Cheeto , this is Ki . She 's awesome . All right , well , I gotta go . You two have fun . Gotta practice . Brian . Rule number 35 . Are you the cat that 's been pooping on my floor ? Yes you are . Behold . Overdrift Purgatorio . Designed by the Zen drifting monks of the Hokkaido region . It remains the most extreme overdrift game ever conceived . Should a player be brave enough , skilled enough , crazy enough , to tame one of the wild super cars , Purgatorio shall grant him a jewel fit for a king . Alas , in their mad dreams to construct the ultimate racer the drift monks installed a feature way too hardcore for the casual gamer . You see , when you enter Purgatorio , you cannot leave until you win . They say that one kid got trapped in there for three days . I heard another kid peed his pants . I heard a kid died . All those legends are both true and untrue , except for the one where the kid died . That 's why they banned the game , and Purgatorio vanished into antiquity ! Until I found a copy . On E-bay . So , Theodore , now that you 've heard the tale , I have only one question . Did you go to the bathroom first ? I can hold it . We shall see , Ted . We shall see . Ah , god . You 've done this a thousand times . Hi buddy . All right , no more screwing around . I can do this . He 's been in there for hours , DK . He 's not ready for this . Were you ready , Tricksy ? Or any of us ? Crap , I really gotta pee . All right . Ok . No . It can 't be . I thought they patched her out . Patched her out ? That car is no bug , child . Then what is she ? A cruel joke programmed by the monks at the height of their madness . Better pass , Ted . Heed not her siren 's call . Oh , sweet stripes . No way you 're getting passed me without a race , buddy . Now poop . Good boy . Hello . Um , do you want me to do the girl 's bathroom , too , or just ... ? Is that a cat ? Yes . Uh , yes it is ... a cat . Why would you have a cat ? You 're breaking a ... rule . You 're breaking Rule 35 . You see , that 's not entirely true . I am the RA , and I just trained ... Uh-uh . No . No . ' Cause you ... you said " rules are rules . " That 's what you ... said . You , said " rules are rules . " Wendell , control your breathing . No ! No ! You 're breaking the rules , Ki . I 'm not gonna ... I 'm not gonna listen to anything you say anymore , ok ? Oh my god ! Everyone ! Everyone ! Everyone ! Everyone ! Everyone ! Ki 's housing a cat ! She 's breaking a rule ! Everybody back inside . No ! No ! No , no , no ! Oh my god ! The rules . The rules are all a lie . The rules are all a lie . Nothing is real . Authority ! Authority extension ! Silly string fight ! No ! No ! Stop it ! Brian ! Hey , how 's it goin ' ? All freshed up ? Yeah , good to go . Good . Well , in that case , wanna go ? You know , actually , I think I may just stay and practice a little more . Really ? You 're good , though , right ? Like for tomorrow . You 've got the whole bomb thing down ? Yeah . Yeah . Like all the way down . 'Cause Brian if you don 't , I really need to know that . No . No . No . Jenny , I 've been at this for like hours , so why don 't we go grab a bite to eat ? See you in the closet in five . Ok . No ! No ! Not again ! Yeah ! Well , girl , you are pretty crazy , but I like that ! I 'm gonna call you Helenore . What ? But you 're my car now ! Helenore ! Come back ! Come on , DK . We 'll pry him out in the morning . Attention frag floor residents , rules are rules . That means no pets . No silly string ! No sodas in the halls ! No unsanctioned pizza parties ! Now , clean up ! What have I done ? Cheeto ? Cheeto ? To ... explosive chemistry . I can 't do it ! I can 't disarm a bomb . What ? You said that you could . I lied . I 'm sorry . I told my mom that you could do it . She wanted to bench you . Well , I can 't . She probabaly should . No , no , no . It 's fine . You 'll probably just do your Brian thing and it 'll all ... No , Jenny , I can 't do it . I couldn 't do it all afternoon . I don 't know why . I just can 't . Well , that sucks . I 'm gonna have to put somebody else in . Look , just next time don 't lie to me about it , ok ? I won 't . I promise . All right . I should go . Thanks . Ok . Thirty second time 's the charm . Easy , girl . Easy . No ! What do you want from me ? Oh , you want to race again ? Well , forget it ! You 're a stupid cheating butt , and I hope you crash , you piece of junk . You heard what I said . Go away ! Cheeto ? Cheeto ? Cheeto . Hi . I 'm sorry I threw you out earlier . I didn 't mean to . I did mean to , but ... let 's get you home to Brian . Man , cats are really easy to grab , am I right ? Especially the dumb ones . Well , it 's time to get you in trouble . Shane , please . That 's Brian 's cat . You 're a business man . I 'm sure we can work this out . Sorry , Kiwi , rules are rules . Viva la vista ! Those guys bein' mean to ya back there ? There ya go . That 's better . Look , do you wanna race ? I 'm gonna be stuck here for a while , so ... No fair starting without me . I 'm empty . Ok , on three . Ok , yeah . Heads up ! It 's the final round . VGHS has one final chance to disarm the bomb and win the game . Games , don 't charge the bomb . Sorry . I don 't need sorrys . I need you to get it together . This is the final round , guys . They are adapting and nailing us to the wall . I need to throw them a curve ball . Put in Brian . With all due respect , coach , Brian will crush this . I know he may be undisciplined , but when you need him , he steps up to the plate . Trust me . Put him in . Coach with even more due respect , the Deanster may have failed in covering Jenny , but when the going gets tough , the Deanster gets ... Out . Dean , you 're out . Brain 's in . Hey , I get it . You just wanna play . Ok , then . Let 's play ! Jax ! Move ! Law , turn it around ! Aw , no can do . It 's outta range ! Also , who 's this Law feller ya 'll talking ' about ? What happens when it goes out of range , Law ? It goes home ! I 'm not Law ! VGHS ! Well , it 's just you and me now , Jax . Bomb armed . Okay , I 'm gonna go stand up and disarm the bomb . Yes ! Great race ! Really ? Do you think I 'm gonna fall for that again ? Yes ! And that 's how I got Cheeto to become the school mascot . Thanks again , Ki . How was your day , Ted ? It was all right . Psych ! It was awesome ! First , I woke up . Wait , no go back . First , I was asleep , and then I woke up . And then I went to Pur-ga-tur-i-o ! He 's on to me . Better call ... huh ? Better call who ? Sorry , man . I 'll let you get back to that . No problem . By the way , it 's " Better call whom ? " Oh , jeez , thanks ! Better call whom ? He was wrong . It 's " Better call who ? " I knew it !

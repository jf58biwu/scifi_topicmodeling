 Listen up , people . As long as nothing happens for the next 15 minutes , our insurance will be reinstated . So , let 's just sit quietly and run out the clock . A giant sausage ! Oh , God , no ! Get out of here , you horrific sausage ! Wait . Isn 't today the parade ? Lt 's just a giant balloon ! Giant balloon ? See , buddy , it 's not so scary . I feel better now . Why are so many different parades smooshed together ? Lt 's the Parade Day Parade . What 's Parade Day ? Lt used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade . Why , when I was a boy , we had a parade every day . Those were dark times . Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day Parade and get it over with . Hey , look , a fog is rolling in . No , that 's just the Jamaican Pride float . Looks like it 's speeding up . Oh , no ! Lt 's within munching distance of the Doritos float ! Thank you . Thank you . Kif , you 're slacking off on my waving arm . Oh , no . It 's heading right for those two nerds ! Whoa . Sweet shirt , dude . Thanks . I have another one that says " Paleontologists Do lt In The Dirt . " I 'm a paleontologist . I 'll save one of you ! Oh , honey , I dig you so much . Thank you for saving my stupidly-dressed husband . You 're a hero . A hero , indeed . What 's your name , son ? I don 't know . Fry ? Ladies and gentlemen , I 'm proud to associate myself with a true hero . Mr. Fry , allow me to present you with the keys to the city ! This one 's for the deadbolt , this is for the top lock . I think this one 's for the knob . The city 's in a bad neighborhood . Care to say a few words , son ? Uh ... Heroes don 't do drugs . Except for Drugman , I guess . I hereby declare that henceforth , this Saturday shall be known as Fry-Day ! Lt sure was nice of the mayor 's wife to have sex with me . Uh ? You . What ? You could have saved a robot , but instead , you saved a human . Do you think human life is more precious than robot life ? No , no . Well , yes , actually . That 's it . I 'm killing myself . Oh , lord . Don 't try to talk me out of it ! Well ? Bender , you always say you 're going to kill yourself , but you almost never do . Yeah . Last time you went to the suicide booth , you ended up dating it for six months . How is Lynn , by the way ? Living in Oregon with her crazy mother . See you at my funeral , suckers ! Kill me , please , and make it splatter ! With pleasure , Bender . Lynn ? Huh . Wow , you look great . Fat , but great . I thought you were in Oregon . My mom tried to commit suicide in me . I don 't want to talk about it . Well , tell your mom I said " hello , " and it 's been nice catching up with you . Let 's get this show on the road . Oh , no . You 're going to die , all right , but it won 't be suicide . It 'II be murder . Missed me ! He did it ! He actually did it this time . No way , mon . He 's faking it . He really is gone ! Everyone , put on your taking-off caps . Our what ? Lt 's a sign of respect , you savage ! Poor , nasty , mean old Bender . I can 't believe we 'll never hear his evil laugh again . I miss him so much . There , there , Fry . He may be gone , but he 'll always be with us as a trash can . Look at that loser getting garbage dumped in him . Glad I 'm not him , whoever he is . Fry , as his only friend , you should have first pick of body parts . Just don 't pick his nose ! Ha , ha , ha , ha . What 's wrong with you guys ? This is comedy gold . He always had my back . So I 'll take his arm . As a back-scratcher . I love you , Bender ! Somebody hand me a bolt cutter . Hey , dip-schlitz , that 's not me . I 'm right here . Hello ? Pay attention to me ! Why can 't anybody hear my witty remarks ? This is hell . You wish . Robot devil ? You can hear me ? Why is everyone else ignoring me ? Isn 't it obvious , Bender ? Yeah , I guess it is . You 're dead ! What ? I thought I just had laryngitis and antigravity . Come down to my office and I 'll explain everything . So what 's happening to me ? And I 'll take my answer in any form but a song . Oh , you 're no fun . You see , Bender , it 's simple . You 're a ghost . A ghost ? No , just the regular kind . Because you killed yourself , you 're in limbo . Your software was exported to the computational cloud . Adoy . Wait . Adoy ? Your disembodied program is now running on the wireless network shared by all machinery . Cut to the chase , smokey . How do I get out of limbo ? That 's the laughy part . You can 't ! You 're stuck in an infinite loop . An infinite loop ? I don 't have time for that ! Man , this is all Fry 's fault . Fry ? I hate that guy . We once traded hands . They still stink of candy corn . Get this . That jerk said human life was more valuable than robot life . What ? After all you 've done for him ? Fry must die ! I know , right ? I 'd murder him good , if only I was still alive . Hmm ... Bender , would you like to make a deal ? I 'm not stupid . So , yes , absolutely . What have I agreed to ? I 'll return you to your body after you use your ghostly powers to scare Fry to death . That sounds fair and also fun . I like that there 's no catch this time . But , wait . There 's a catch . Crap ! Lf you fail , you 'll spend eternity here in robot hell . Which , as luck would have it , is where I rehearse my band . Hit it , boys ! Cigars are evil , you won 't miss ' em ... Okay , I 'll do it , I 'll do it ! Just stop the damn music ! Scare Fry to death ? Ha ! I could do that in my sleep . Whoo ! Whoo-oo-oo-oo ! What are you ? Deaf ? Whoo ! Whoo ! Hmm . Soap . I know Fry 's afraid of that . Maybe he 'll die if I rub him all over with it , real slow . Whoa , sick ! My software can control electronics ! What the ... No ! Not the armpits ! Winter 's coming ! As you can see , since Bender 's death , requests to bite one 's shiny metal ass are down 98 % . Do you mind doing that later ? Bite my shiny metal ass . Help ! I was attacked in my bathroom ! By my bathroom ! I 'm being haunted by a ghost ! Fry , you 're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide . Here . Take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls . All right . I got him all heebie-jeebied with my bathroom of horrors . One more good scare , and I 'll be out of limbo . Ooh . Did someone say limbo ? No . Nothing . Hold onto your dookie . It 's about to get spooky ! I 'm telling you , something supernatural is happening . I 'm scared to death ! Stop being ridiculous . There 's no such thing as whatever you 're saying . Ow , ow , ow ! Whoa , maybe you 're right . I only meant to slap you twice . All I know is I 've got a ghost that needs busting . Who you gonna call ? Gho ... The number you have dialed has been lame since 1989 . Now do you believe me ? Oh , Fuff , enough of your superstitious nonsense . I 'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science . Let the seance begin . I said science ! The veil is lifting . I am gazing into the spirit world , and nothing . You said something about a buffet ? I 'm right here , you lazy shyster . Wait , I 'm sensing something . I 'm rich . Ow ! Is it a ghost ? There 's no such thing as ghosts , you donkey-monkey . It 's a robot ghost . A robot ghost ? What robot would want to haunt me ? Me , dumbass . Bender , Bender , Bender , Bender ! Ah , tell him , you baggy old crone . Finally . Any more ridiculous ideas ? Hallelujah . I 'm here to conduct the exorcism and avail myself of the buffet . Can I get an amen and a goodly helping of Scruffy 's famous corn biscuits ? Right away , Reverend . Oh , lord . I got the too-much-macaroni sweats . Now , where is this alleged apparition ? Might be a problem with your circuit breaker . See you . Please , I 'm under constant attack by machinery . I can 't sleep , I can 't think , I can 't even think . Very well . This sacramental firewall scans for and removes ghostware in a 20 foot radius . Bring it on , holy man . Carry this at all times and the demon cannot harm you . It also keeps cats off the sofa by killing ' em . Ah . So quiet , so peaceful . Time to lower my guard even for a minute . Ow ! Heart attack . Yep , I was right . Okay , Beelzy , Fry 's dead . A ghost ! Oh , it 's you . A deal 's a deal , so give me my body back . Fry 's dead , you say ? Funny , that 's not what it says on his Wikipedia page . Survived a heart attack ? Damn you , Obama-care ! I 'm afraid your heart has suffered a lot of damage , Mr. Fry , and my cleavage isn 't helping . Not helping him . One more sudden shock will kill you . Sudden ? That 's just the kind of one more shock I was planning . The machines , they 're after me . You 're suffering from machine phobia . Your only hope is to go to the Amish Home World , where no machines are allowed . I guess it 's for the best . Whoo ... The only machine I 'll ever miss is Bender . Say what ? Now that he 's gone , I realize how valuable a robot life can be , when it belongs to my best friend . That 's the closest thing to " Bender is great " that anyone besides me has ever said . Final boarding call for Flight 38 to the Amish Home World . As a reminder , passengers are limited to two carry-on butter churns . I 'm sorry , Fry , I 'm sorry . Wait for your ghost-buddy . Brother Fry , thou hast visitors . Hi , Fry . Hello . Hey , how have you been ? Well , yank my beard . This be a surprise . How are you , Fry ? Thank you for asking , English . My life is simple but plain , and though Bender be gone , somehow I feel he 's still with me . I sure am , Brother Fry . Yo , big bonnet , move your ugly but modest head covering . Ah , right , you can 't hear me . Oh , I hear you loud and clear . You 're not Granny Hester . What have you done with Granny Hester ? She 's naked but unharmed . And now , Bender , it 's time to fulfill your end of the deal . Sorry , I 'm not going to kill Fry . Take me to hell for all eternity , just as long as my little bearded meat bag gets to live . That he will not , for you see , it is your fate to kill him . Says you . I would never kill Fry , not even to save my own life . But , Bender , isn 't a robot life worth ever so much more than a human life ? Of course not . What idiot thinks that ? You . You 're using my own words against me . Go to hell ! Soon enough , but first , the killing . Have you noticed that animals are sometimes spooked by robot ghosts ? So what ? I hate animals . Run for your life , Fry ! Move your ham flaps ! He can 't hear you , Bender . I 'm afraid your friend is about to be fully buckminstered ! Oh , yeah ? I 'll just jump into a machine and get his attention that way . Ah ! But there aren 't any machines on this planet . There 's one , you rusty old dummy . Hey , no fair . Ocupado . Got you . Ow ! Ow ! Come here , Devil . What are you doing ? And Scruffy 's buffet , how 's that going ? Fry , Fry , look out for that bowling barn . Bender , is that thou ? I love you . Oh , my God . Did you see that ? Are you okay ? What just happened ? Uh . Well , I think the Robot Devil said he loved me in Bender 's voice wearing Granny Hester 's clothes . I want to go home . You still lose , Bender . You failed to kill Fry , so you 're banished to hell . I get a new body , and you get to be a translucent chump till the end of time . Big deal . I saved my friend . As far as I 'm concerned , I won . Oh , really ? You may find your victory Pyrrhic when subjected to this lyric For a trillion years or so Yeah . Hey , where are you going ? I don 't know and I don 't care . Yay , I 'm back . Wait , this is my stop . Oh . This guy . Bender , for your selfless act in saving Fry , I am pleased to welcome you to Robot Heaven . Shut up , God ! Beg pardon ? I want to go back to Robot Earth . I mean regular Earth . Hey , stop that . I command you , you jerk . Just get out . Whoa ! Whoo . I 've been through the adventure of a lifetime . Ow ! I 'm back , baby . You 're back from the dead ? I 'm back from lots of stuff . Oh , Bender , Bender , I missed you so much . Hey , wait , did you haunt me ? English - US - PSDH

 Wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up ! Where were you ? Oh , Jean . I am so sorry . I 'll never hurt you , or anyone ever again . It 's too late . - No ! Jean ! - You can 't hide ... No , Jean , no ! I 've been trying to find the Wolverine for over a year . It 's not who I am anymore . My employer wants to say thank you for saving his life all those years ago . Run ! Now ! There was a time when our enemies knew honor . I wanted to offer you something no one else can . A gift . You have struggled long enough . I can end your eternity . Make you mortal . ON JULY 26 What they did to me what I am , can 't be undone . Don 't be so sure . I 'm not healing like before . His flesh is weak now . Eternity ... can be a curse . A man can run out of things to live for . That day ain 't here yet . 7.26.13 IN REALD 3D DIGITAL 3D Sync , corrected by Johnny B. Goode

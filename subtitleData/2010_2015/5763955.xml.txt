 Barbie : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down On chester 's mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , We still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , Bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . I 'm getting e-mail . The signal 's getting stronger . It 's coming from here . Pauline : James , I expect you know That I 'm alive . Talk to lyle chumley . ( digital noise ) No , no . Come on , come on , come on . She was drowning in the lake . She just appeared . I have no idea where she came from . Sam : You made a promise 25 years ago to make sure That what we buried stayed buried . Looks like angle got a piece of whoever did this to her . Those are the fingertips of a hand . Big hand . A man 's . Summer ' 88 . Lyle , Sam , pauline . What ? What is it ? Melanie : It 's ... Me . Rebecca : And the day 's coming when there won 't be It may become necessary to thin the herd . This is a census to help you decide who lives and who dies . ¶ ¶ Good morning . I 'm not sure how good it is . It is if you 're using the census To address our population problem . Well , got to see where we stand . Well , we know where we stand . We need people who are healthy , with practical skills , Who give more than they take . So , who 's next ? Alice . She was the first dome baby . Her mother 's harriet- - she teaches Sunday school . Uh-huh . What else does harriet do ? That 's it . She 's a ... Single mother , A woman of faith . Jim , our food supplies are dwindling . We can 't let these emotions dictate . It won 't be easy ... Listen , I grew up with these people . I was chosen to lead them . I 'm not gonna shake the tree until I 'm sure Who can carry their own weight ... And who can 't . But how will you be sure ? ( softly ) : I don 't know . ( sighs ) Maybe the dome will guide me . That 's a start . ( groans ) Big jim ( sighs ) : What are you up to ? Um ... I 'm headed to the school . Our windmill power project is really coming along . Listen , rebecca ... We 're gonna get through this . ( exhales ) as long as you 're leading us . ( knocking ) Are you okay ? No . Did phil I.D. Angie 's killer From the stuff we found under her fingernails ? That 's a dead end- - there 's no way to run the dna . And half the town probably has scratches after the magnetization . Rebecca pine thinks chester 's mill can 't sustain itself For much longer , and she and jim Want to use the census to decide who lives and who doesn 't . Wow . I know . It sounds crazy . No . Big jim 's always had a god complex . I know they have a plan ; we need to find out what it is . We ? I could use the help . Where does barbie stand on all this ? On jim 's side . ( bell tinkles ) jim . We need to talk about your extermination plan . Reduction option . Okay , whatever . Look , I know that we need to prepare for the worst , okay ? But if that day happens , I want to be clear- - No one acts unless we both agree . Listen , barbie , I don 't want that day to get here any more than you do . Look , chester 's mill couldn 't have survived The past few days without you- - The magnets , the crops , the rain . If we need to take that next step , We do it together . Harriet . There 's so many people here . It makes me feel like alice has a family . Well , that 's right . One big family . Hey , we 're so lucky to have you take care of us . Right , barbie ? That 's right . ( whispers ) : Yeah . ( quietly ) : If this place runs out of food , Let 's hope that we 're not on the menu . How can this be ? Joe : Yearbooks don 't lie . It 's from 25 years ago . Hey , this is kind of personal , But do you have probe marks ? Joe , please . Save your theory on intelligent life-forms of the universe For a ted talk . Explain her memory loss , and the fact that She hasn 't aged in decades . Maybe the dome sent her . It sent my mom . Hey ! No , melanie 's a person . The dome sent an avatar ; you can 't grab an avatar . Okay , Whatever she is , let 's not manhandle her . And since there 's no way she 's actually melanie cross , Then we probably shouldn 't call her that . Then what should we call her ? I should know what my name is . But I don 't . ( footsteps nearby ) Uh , yeah , no , the last thing he wants to hear Is that you found the fountain of youth in 1988 . Rockin ' the same clothes as yesterday . Too busy to come home last night ? Yeah . Is julia here ? No . She left a note saying she 'll be back later . What are you guys doing up so early ? We need to talk to julia ... Uh , we got e-mails . You got e-mails when ? And you 're just telling me about this now ? We all got e-mails , until the signal was blocked . And this popped up . Barbie : " this page can 't be displayed . " You think the military 's blocking us , or ... ? That 's not the standard response . We get that signal back , we can communicate Hey , I want you to take me to where this came through . Lyle : The devil shall cast some of you into prison , That ye may be tried ; Ye shall have tribulation ten days : Be thou faithful unto death , And I will give you a crown of life . On your feet , lyle . You came to set me free . My mother said you had answers ; I want them . Hey ... I can do better than tell you . I ... I can show you . Let me out . ( sighs ) Put these on . O ye of little faith . You kidnapped rebecca and you tried to kill her . She was standing ... In the way of the rapture . ( scoffs quietly ) if I 'm gonna break you out , I want your hands together . Think of it as a prayer . Thanks for coming over . How 's the piglet ? I think it 's a flu . Oh . ( exhales ) I 'm sorry . It 's too late . I 'm worried about the others . She was a newborn . The others are strong . If it 's a flu , they 'll fight it . People can catch this , too . Are you feeling all right ? I 'm fine . So is beth . We 've been careful about contact . Good . Do you have a wheelbarrow ? No sense touching her more than you have to . ( exhales ) Everything happens for a reason . This wi-fi signal 's gone . Joe : It disappeared when I got here . So , you said this is where it was strongest , right here ? Yep . Because not enough 's creepy about that locker . ( rattling locker ) I 'm gonna have to go find something to pry this open with . Uh , there 's nothing in there . But you don 't know that- - it 's locked . How do you know that combination ? I think this was my locker ... In 1988 . What ? Okay , I-is this some kind of joke ? Played on us by the universe . Looks like her , huh ? That doesn 't make any sense . And the dome does ? I mean , you could be this girl 's daughter . Barbie ... You know what it 's like to be a stranger here . I don 't want to be one anymore . I 'm not sure I can help you with that . Why not ? The signal 's gone . Help us figure out who she really is . ( closes locker ) Let 's go . ( grunts ) Rebecca likes to take her work home with her . Or doesn 't want to be seen doing it at school . She 's been somewhere with a lot of muck . Eggs for breakfast , blood samples for dinner ? Whatever she 's doing , she 's taking precautions . Yeah . She 's got a calendar of when we run out of food and resources . She really does think it 's the end of days . Our science teacher in prayer group . That 's new . ( sighs ) Huh . Well , she does have an interest In one of god 's creatures , pigs . Blood work , vet books , Mud on the doormat . There are a few farms around here with pigs . Let 's see if she paid a visit to any of them recently . Big jim : Rebecca ? Hello ? Rebecca ? You working on the windmills ? ( keys jangling ) rebecca ? Norrie : We 're supposed to use microfilm in julia 's newspaper office ? Seriously ? This is how they found things in the stone age . Yeah , we can 't search by melanie 's name ? ( sighs ) no . You just got to scroll and look . I miss the internet , I miss my cell phone , I miss texting , I miss sushi . Well , the hall of records turned up nothing , okay ? This is the last place that I can think to look ... For whatever it is that we might find . Melanie wasn 't in the '87 or ' 89 yearbooks . Maybe the independent ran an article about why her family Came to chester 's mill in 1988 . Or why she left . In a town where betsy van needles ' record-breaking tomato Makes the front page , I 'd say we have a pretty good shot . Guys , look . Melanie cross went missing and was never found . Melanie : " the family moved " to chester 's mill from zenith A short time ago . " Zenith ? That 's the same town that I 'm from . I thought you looked familiar . Melanie 's family lived at 24 old oak drive . If she remembered the combo When she stood in front of her locker , then ... You think she 'll remember more if we take her To the house ? No . No , she won 't . Because she 's not ... She 's not melanie cross . There 's just no way . I want to go there . I have to . All right . What do we say when we barge in on the family That lives there now ? You let me handle that . Talk to me . Tell me how my mother 's still alive . We had a plan : Severed brake lines , Pilfered corpses , that idiot reverend coggins , he ... God rest his soul . My mother faked her suicide , and you helped her ? I loved her very much , james , I still do . To protect you . She knew the dome was coming . The pink stars in the paintings ? She had to get out before she was taken out . What does that mean ? Your father had other plans for her . ( panting ) He has no idea that she 's still alive ? No . What about sam ? Pauline only trusted me to help her escape . What kind of a mother leaves her son behind in this hell ? I think she thought the dome would follow her and spare you . I had to go to her funeral . She left me here . She left me to turn into big jim rennie . Look , she- - your mother trusts me . For nine years that 's how pauline stayed in touch . With postcards ? Yeah . They 're from all different places , But there 's nothing on ' em . Yeah , there is . She made those . Turn ' em over . Her paintings . Do those look familiar ? This is all the stuff that happened Since the dome came down . The egg , the butterflies , The red rain . If she 's out there , how could she possibly know What 's going on under here ? Pauline saw a lot more than pink stars . ( door opens ) big jim : I don 't see Any windmills . You stole my card , Lied to me . What are you doing , rebecca ? I 'm finding a way . When the dome first came down , I started visiting farms , Monitoring crops and livestock . Tom tilden had a sick pig . The flu . What 's inside the eggs , rebecca ? You said you 'd do what it takes to save this town . What 's inside those eggs is how you 're gonna do it . Hello ? They left the front door unlocked . Probably went to the parade in westlake And got trapped outside the dome on dome day . Lucky them . ( inhales ) whew . They didn 't even finish breakfast . Norrie : Some kid didn 't have To finish his algebra homework and avoided the hamster ball . Double win . Does it look familiar ? I don 't remember anything . Because there 's nothing to remember . All I feel is sad . It sucked having to walk through my house with my family gone . And after angle ... I 'm glad the place fell down . How am I supposed to compete with a girl He thinks is from a galaxy far , far away ? Uh , I 'm sure he 's just trying to help . Don 't undermine my feelings of jealousy and abandonment . But since we 're chatting , what 's up with you and julia ? ( chuckles ) Come on . You show up with the " please forgive me " face . She left before you got there , So she didn 't want to hear it . Whatever you did was super bad . Your eyebrow just twitched . Yeah , it did . I 'm really glad we could have this little chat . Joe : Barbie , nore . Oh , my god . I made these . I used to look out the window and see them falling . She saw stars fall ? They were pink . Yeah . Over there . I went out to find them . That 's where we found the mini-dome . We got to go there . Joe , slow down . The dome came out of nowhere and changed our lives forever . Angie was killed- - I might never know why . This is a chance to find an answer- - To find one damn answer- - Even if it 's not for me . Norrie : I think we should look . ( sighs ) All right . We go to the woods . If we find nothing , we go home . Thank you . Six farms and nothing . Still one to go . Yeah , but according to the farmers , Rebecca was only monitoring livestock and crop yields . She said the point of the town census Was to inventory resources . Maybe ... What ? Maybe she 's not planning anything bad . No , no , no . You didn 't hear what I heard in her voice . Or see her douse lyle with that acid rain . Though it wouldn 't be the first time I 've misjudged someone . I don 't really know you . Hell , I 've been out in the woods for so long , There are days I don 't even know myself . But I do know that I 've been betrayed before . What are you getting at , sam ? People are full of surprises . They sure are . How long you been planning this ? I 'd been monitoring the pig for weeks . Testing blood at my house to see how the virus affected cells . When were you gonna tell me ? Once everything was ready . That 's why I needed to get in here , To mix the swine flu with samples of influenza . In a few hours , the recombinant virus inside those eggs Will be strong enough to infect one quarter Of this town . You want to release it ? No . I want you to . You want me to play god ? You said you wanted to see who could carry their own weight . This is how . It 's not god- - it 's-it 's darwin . It 's survival of the fittest . Meaning we 're at risk , too . Yes . A virus is nature 's way of leveling the playing field . ( quietly ) : This is crazy . It 's merciful . In seven days , we run out of food . In 14 , people will be starving . In 21 , We 'll turn on each other . The time to act is now . How 'd this virus get inside the dome ? It 's always been here , dormant in nature for ... Weeks , months ... Maybe years . You mean like an incubator . The dome made this happen . You 're saying my mom 's a prophet ? No , I 'm saying That these events brought us closer to the apocalypse , When the world 's gonna burn with the sacred fires And our ashes are gonna float up into the heavens . That 's when I 'm gonna be with pauline again . The rain ... I thought presaged the end of days , But that 's just ' cause that 's the last card I got . Well , whatever it was , it was a good thing that rebecca stopped it . Hey ! If she interfered with the dome 's plan , We 're gonna be condemned to purgatory under this thing for all of time . Forever , forever , forever . Lyle , lyle , lyle , settle down , Or the cuffs are going back on . Look ... These couldn 't have come after the dome came down . Maybe we don 't know how it ends . You 're right . Postcards stopped . But she did write in the journal every day . I bet you the key to this is in the journal . Uh , my uncle came and picked up A bunch of her stuff after the funeral . She wouldn 't want sam to have her journal . Not him . What is it with you guys , anyway ? It doesn 't matter . Let 's just go get the journal . Oh , no , no . You don 't want to know About your mother ? What about that girl That got killed ? Angie ? Why would you say that ? I have a real clear view of the sweetbriar rose from my porch . I 've watched you waiting for her To pick her up after her shift . I 'm really sorry about what happened to her ... Wait . You think my mom put angle 's murder in her journal ? ( pigs grunting ) Oh , thank god . Did rebecca send you to help ? Help with what ? She said it 'd be just the one pig , But she was wrong . There are more . Just since this morning . A dozen of them . This is what rebecca was messing around with in her kitchen . That pig virus is their extermination plan . Yeah , and she doesn 't know how strong it is . We 've got to find them before they release it . Where would they do it ? Someplace busy , someplace public . Julia : Big jim 's having a town meeting at the sweetbriar rose . That 's where they 'll be . ( birds chirping ) Barbie : This is where julia brought me , to show me the mini-dome . Joe : Melanie , where are you going ? She 's going to the exact spot where it was . ( gasping ) ( gasping breaths ) ( gasping ) whoa ! You all right ? ( panting ) What just happened ? ( panting ) : I remember . It was night . I came here looking For where the pink stars fell with pauline verdreaux . Junior 's mom ? Yes . We were with sam verdreaux and lyle chumley . ( laughs ) : They were our boyfriends . You and sam ? My head is exploding . Hold on . And then what happened ? I don 't know . That spot . Joe : It 's bringing back your memory . If you want to know more about who you are , Then you have to get back on it . ( gasps ) Young melanie : What is it ? Lyle : Looks like a meteor . It 's glowing . Let 's go see . ( panting ) We found a meteorite . Right here . Maybe we 're supposed to touch it . ¶ ¶ ( rumbling ) When we touched it , it ... It cracked open . ( screams ) What is happening ? ! Is everybody okay ? You okay ? Melanie : There was an egg inside . Pauline ( sobbing ) : Oh , my god ... Melanie , what are you doing ? Pauline : Put it back . Don 't do that . I took it . I wanted to protect it . Melanie , put it back ! Melanie ! Where are you going ? Where are you going ? Mel-melanie ! Melanie ! Sam told me to put it back , but I wouldn 't . Drop it , melanie . Put it back ! Pauline ( sobbing ) : What is happening ? ! The sound is killing me ! ( gasps ) ¶ ¶ ( panting ) I am melanie cross . ( gasps ) And I think this is where I died . ( panting ) ( birds chirping ) Is the virus ready ? Yes . Are you ? No one tells you what it 's like Being the one who has to decide . You were chosen Because you 're strong enough to do it . You know , I was tested like this before . What happened ? It was my wife , pauline . She got sick . She started ... Seeing things , got paranoid , had these spells . She was mentally ill ; That 's ... That 's not your fault . I knew she needed help , so ... I found this facility ... A few towns away . She begged me Not to take her there , Promised she 'd get better . And I gave in . Didn 't make her go . 'cause I loved her . I believed that would be enough . But it wasn 't . She took her own life . I 'm sorry . If I 'd made the tough choice , the right choice Maybe she would have gotten better . Maybe she 'd be alive . This time I 'll make that choice . My mother died when I was eight . Her heart just ... It ... Stopped . We were riding our bikes around the army base , And suddenly she was just ... Gone . ( sighs ) I asked my dad why , And he said , " sometimes There are no answers . " And that 's why I turned to science . If you look hard enough , there is an answer . You 'll need to distribute it in water . A crowd will increase the rate of infection . I know the place . Joe : Back in 1988 , You , sam , pauline and lyle were the original four hands . And you found an egg , too ? And some jackass killed her because of it . Are you sure you didn 't see who pushed you ? It wasn 't pauline- - she was ... Freaking out . Lyle was really mad . So was sam . I just wanted to protect the egg . ( shovel strikes hard object ) what was that ? Feels like a rock . ( chuckles ) : Yeah , a rock from outer space . Initials : " m.C. " Melanie I believe this is yours . If I died ... Then what am I ? And why are you here ? And where are your bones ? I bet sam verdreaux could answer those questions . Yeah . He was there that night . And if all this is true , He 's seen melanie in the last couple days . I mean , he helped julia save her life . Wouldn 't you remember your ex-girlfriend ? But he acts like he never even knew her . Maybe it 's not an act , though . And maybe he 's the one who killed her . It 's either him or lyle . But sam loved me . Well , he 's hiding something . Hey , big jim . We caught those vandals that were defacing the bridge . Good job , phil . Keep it up . ( sighs ) Julia : Jim ! I was just , uh , getting something to drink Before the big meeting . What 's ... Nobody drink the water . Jim , you need anything ? Yeah . I need these two escorted out of here . Why ? So you can dump a deadly flu virus into the drinking water ? ( others gasp ) what are you talking about ? You think you get to control who lives and who dies ? ( excited chatter ) All right , everyone , calm down . I don 't know what these two are talking about ... Well , I 'd be more than happy to tell everybody About how you and rebecca ... You want to listen To someone who wakes up every day Trying to make chester 's mill a better place , Or do you want to believe the town drunk and the town s ... ( chuckles ) : Well , I 'm too much of a gentlemen to say . You can call me whatever you want after you empty your pockets . I don 't got anything to prove to you . Be careful with that . What 's this ? Where is it ? Where 's the virus ? What virus ? Rebecca has it ! We shouldn 't be going through my uncle 's stuff like this . Hey , if your mom 's journal 's here , It doesn 't belong to sam , it 's not his stuff . It belongs to you . It 's the only way to bring forth the four horsemen . Okay , enough with the rapture crap . ( sighs ) This is it , right ? Hey , give ... Give it back . I 've been waiting a long time for that . To end it all , to be with pauline- - And there are pages missing ! I 'm calling the shots here , lyle ! No . Lyle ! Oh . Okay . ( panting ) : What did you find ? Suddenly , the nonbeliever seeks enlightenment . Does it say something about angie ? What don 't you want me to see ? You could have followed her to the school that night . You killed angle , and you used me to get out . ( grunts ) Why did I have to do that ? ! Huh ? ( panting ) : I 'm sorry , kid . I 'm out for good now . Harriet : Welcome . You can light a candle if you like . Welcome . Feel free to light a candle . Welcome . Good to see you . Welcome . Good to see you . Welcome . Good to see you . More than half my pigs are dead . The virus is out of control . More are sick . The town needed them . Why did this happen to us ? Sometimes there are no answers , tom . Try to have faith That we 'll get through this together . Hi . ( speaking softly ) Rebecca ! Get away from me ! You 've killed us all ! Julia , I didn 't do it . I didn 't release it . Get away from there . J-just check my purse . Carefully . Crisis of conscience ? I heard that the virus mutated . I will go as far as I need to , but not farther . What ? I didn 't do anything . The road to hell is paved with good intentions . Oh , so now you and julia are gonna save the town , huh ? How are you gonna feed the people when you run out of food ? Not by killing them . You never had the balls to make the tough decisions . When pauline started losing her mind and killed herself , You just ran to the bottle . Now you 're running off to julia . Yeah , and you 're running your mouth off , as usual . What are you doing here ? She 's joining you in jail . You released the virus . Same thing you were gonna do . Jim would never go through with it . You love this town too much . That 's why I took the virus . You used me . I couldn 't do it , either . But it was your idea- - you 're the one Who talked me into this plan . When I realized the virus mutated , I questioned myself and remembered what you said . I can 't play god . You know what ? Plenty of time for you guys To talk about this downstairs . Tomorrow we 'll have a town meeting And the people can decide your fate . What are you gonna do to us ? Me ? Nothing . My hope is that you 'll be put on trial . Yeah . Let 's hope you bring your boyfriend . The people of chester 's mill will be very interested In what barbie has to say about this virus . Why 's that ? 'cause he was the first one on board . Junior . Is he dead ? No , he 's still breathing . Hey , junior , wake up . Junior , wake up . ( groans ) My head . Why 'd sam do this ? No , it was lyle . Lyle 's in jail . No , he 's not . He 's-he 's gone . He took My mother 's journal . What journal ? Easy , easy . Hey . Where did lyle go ? No . I don 't know , but ... I think he killed angle . Maybe he killed me , too . Joe , come on . Help me . Help me get him up . Come on . Let 's go . ( sighs ) What 's next ? ( sighs ) What comes after an extermination plot ? Hey , we made it through the day . And the guys behind that plan are behind bars . Yeah . Big jim 's probably lying on a lumpy cot , Missing his own bed right about now . Yeah . He 's had better nights . Now we can put the census to good use- - Figure out how to share resources . Thank you . For what ? I showed up on your door at dawn with an insane theory- - You didn 't blink . You 're pretty convincing . You believed me . That means something . ( knocking ) Excuse me . Hey . No . No , julia . Hey , listen . You got to listen to me . Not tonight . You okay ? I will be . Good . I 'm glad . ( gasps ) Oh . Oh . Uh , I 'm sorry . I don 't know ... I don 't know what I was thinking . I 'll go . I ... No , no , no . Please stay . Let 's not make it weird . Okay . Okay . The whole town 's gonna want answers in the morning . I could really use your help coming up with what those are . Honey ? Yeah , thanks .

 - So what do you want from the votanis collective ? - Defiance exists in a state of ongoing political flux . - And what direction do you envision ? - Away from the earth republic . - I am going to tell your husband everything . - This will end very badly for you . - Drink it . All of it . Now . - The poison was on the flask . - I keep telling myself That I 'm just holding down the fort for kenya , But all along I have this terrible feeling That she 's ... - Dead ? - I 've done terrible things . - What terrible things ? - She 'll wake up . They always do . - I made a deal with something . It said it was a god , But now I 'm not so sure . - You shot yourself in the head ? - More like the neck . Barrel slipped . - I taught you better than that . Don 't do that again . - I deserve to die . - Hey ! Stop talking like that . Anyway , you didn 't . - Irzu won 't let me die . - Would you stop that ? It doesn 't come from irzu or any other kind of god . - How do you know ? - Because I do , okay ? Because there 's no such thing as magic . It 's indogene nanorobots or some such thing like that . It 's science , And it can be fixed with science . I don 't trust that doc yewll , But maybe we can find a decent doctor in cedars . - You 're wrong . - I 'm never wrong . - You 're always wrong . - I 'm occasionally wrong . But my heart 's always in the right place . - I wish that was enough . - [ sighs ] That thing , that kid , irzu , Is she here right now ? - She 's inside me . - Yeah ? Can she hear me ? You , in there . Irzu or the kaziri or robby the robot , Whatever you wanna call yourself , You leave my little girl alone . Now . Or I will come in there , I will force you out , And I will take you apart . - That make you feel better ? - Little bit . [ hailer chirps ] Viceroy mercado . What does he want ? Nolan . - [ whispers ] what 's going on ? - [ moaning ] - [ growls ] - [ screaming ] - [ groaning ] - Come here , fella . - Mahsuvus gorath , you 're under arrest For collusion with the votanis collective ... - For acts of terrorism and espionage Against the earth republic . - This makes no sense . - Got him ? [ indistinct chatter ] - Hey ! What 's going on ? - Your boy mahsuvus is a votanis collective spy . He was using his job as night porter as cover . - So since when are we political ? - The collective has planted a bomb Somewhere in new york city That 's gonna detonate in the next 12 hours . - Oh , my god . Between brazil and the operatives in new york . He knows the plan , the players , And the location . Now he 's gonna tell us , one way or another . [ hailer chirps ] - Hello ? - Amanda rosewater ? - Yes . Who is this ? - Free mahsuvus gorath from earth republic custody , Or your sister dies . - What ? - Disobey us , and she dies . Tell anyone about us , well , you get the picture . - Who is this ? - I 'm the man holding a gun To your little sister 's head . - Amanda . Amanda ? Don 't do anything this son of a bitch says ! [ grunting ] - Kenya ! Kenya ! [ call ends ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ - Madam mayor . - Are you sure the bomb is real ? - We intercepted the schematics . It 's a dirty nuke , What they used to call a suitcase bomb . What we don 't have is a specific location , And that is where our friend in the box comes in . - And you have evidence that he works for the collective ? - We floated a bogus transmission , And he bit . - I 've been his boss for the better part of a year . His tolerance for intense pain Makes him one of my more popular night porters . Torture 's not gonna work . - We don 't have a choice . 49,000 men , women , and children Live in manhattan valley . There 's no safe way to evacuate . And even if there was , where would we put them ? New york is surrounded by ocean and raiders . - Have you considered a soft pitch ? Let him think he 's safe . I 'll play the loyal boss . Send me in with a solicitor . We 'll threaten legal action . You 'll release him into my custody , But I 'll be wearing a wire . - What is your interest in mahsuvus ? - He 's a votanis collective spy , And I want to save as many people as possible . - Well , that 's very admirable , But we will handle this our way . - Of course . - State your name for the record . - Forgive me , but I 'm still unclear As to what exactly your interest with me is . Am I under arrest ? - No , ma 'am . - Favi . - Apologies . Favi . - But where are my manners ? Congratulations on your promotion , deputy lasalle . - Corporal . And it 's more of a career change . Now , how long have you known mahsuvus gorath ? - I 'm afraid I don 't know him . - Really ? Because we have witnesses That saw you visit the prisoner On several occasions . - My husband was incarcerated . As you say , A woman has needs . - And were those needs spy-related ? - Miss rainier- - - Captain rainier . - My life here in defiance Has never been more prosperous , In large part due to the stability That the earth republic provides . Why would I take action against them ? - Because playing both sides would be a good strategy . - Oh , perhaps you are right . I should consider that . - Have you ever given scrip to the votanis collective ? - I like to acquire scrip , Not give it away . You were there when the lawkeeper saved my life , Weren 't you ? - Yes , I was . - Nolan . Such a unique man . There 's a certain air about him . Leather , bourbon , gun grease . - I 'm sorry , But I really don 't know What this has to do with our investigation . - Not a thing . Simply that miss- - Captain rainier wears it well . - She 's good at being a gangster , But she 's not a spy . We 'll keep an eye on her , But mahsuvus ' client list is deep . - Nolan . Are you two dating ? - God , no . We 're just having lots of sex . - You know I 'm not going to give you The information that you want . - Yeah , I figured . I can 't stop trying , though . You know that . - I know you do . - It 's not personal . - No hard feelings . Had our positions been reversed , I would have the shrill drilling through your arm . - [ sighs ] You know , my daughter 's irathient . - Am I supposed to care ? - Common ground . I also know you send half your paycheck home To your two kids in brazil . You 'd do anything for ' em , right ? - You 're breaking my heart . - Human father , irathient daughter , Just saying , anything 's possible . It 's you and me , mahsuvus , We decide what kind of world they inherit . Now I 'm not saying That I 'm carrying any water for the e-rep . You ask me , they 're a bunch of puffed-up clowns . Be funny if they weren 't armed to the teeth . But there 's a lot of innocent folks living in new york city . And your people hit ' em with a nuke , You 're setting up everybody south of the armistice line To be a target for retaliation , Including your kids . Now is that what you want for them ? - [ speaking native language ] - War 's over , pal . Nobody won . You know , at the battle of defiance , We laid down our arms . The soldiers decided to end the war . The soldiers were the ones Who decided not to follow orders That didn 't make any sense anymore . - I like you , nolan . Perhaps in a different life , we could 've been friends . - Doubt that , pal . But I might have been persuaded to buy you a drink . Mahsuvus gorath , where 's the bomb ? What time is it scheduled to detonate ? - I have nothing to tell you . [ groans ] [ screaming ] - Where is the bomb ? What time is it scheduled to detonate ? - [ speaking native language ] - How 's his heart ? - Strong as a bell beast . We 're clear to go again . - [ chuckles ] - All right . - [ screams ] [ hailer chirps ] [ screaming continues ] - Listen , I need more time . Once your man moves into lockup , I 'll be able to get him out of town . - That isn 't fast enough ! - Look , he 's strapped to a chair In the middle of a guarded building right now . - You didn 't give up that easily When you were hijacked on that land coach . - How 'd you know that ? - Tell her . Tell your sister . - He claims to have his people everywhere . - Ask him how his v.C. Managed to sneak a bomb Through border security into new york , And yet they can 't manage to boost mahsuvus themselves . - ' cause maybe He isn 't man enough . Maybe none of his people are . - Are you looking to die ? - Kenya , don 't . - If it 's gonna save a city full of innocent people ... I think you should shoot me . - Do not hurt her . - Go ahead , do it . Do it ! [ groans ] - Get to work . - You can keep going at him , but I 'm telling you now , This guy , not gonna break . - We 're done asking politely . - E.G.O. Extraction ? - It is the only way . Have pottinger recalled from the dakota reach . Do make sure the findings from the prisoner 's procedure Are couriered back to my office for immediate decryption . - Of course , sir . - What do you mean by " e.G.O. Extractions " ? I have a history with e.G.O.S. A bad history . Will suck the information right out of his mind . Without all of that shrill unpleasantness . - That could kill him . - Oh , it will kill him . [ door closes ] [ knock at door ] [ soulful rock music plays ] [ knocking continues ] [ charge blade hums ] ¶ [ knocking continues ] - Oh , it 's you . - Expecting someone else ? - In the wake of the bomb threat , I heard the earth republic was interrogating The usual suspects . - You heard right . I was questioned . - You ? They came to you ? - Yes . - And not me . That 's disrespectful . - Put your vanity aside . We have a serious problem . They 're planning to pluck every dirty secret From the head of mahsuvus gorath . - They can torture mahsuvus until the arks rise . He 'll give them nothing . - He won 't have a choice . Giemo has learned that they brought in An e.G.O. Extraction unit . - Well , I have nothing to hide . - I know mahsuvus has been helping you Supply rafe mccawley with weapons To use against the earth republic . Mercado will know too . - They 'll throw me back in reverie . - Actually , I should think they 'll execute you And rafe And me . - No , you had no part in this . - A nuance likely lost on the viceroy . - I will see mercado flayed like a river otter Before I allow him or anyone else to hurt you . - That 's good to hear . - Don 't be complacent , love . It may simply be that killing you is a pleasure I 've reserved for myself . - My life is in your hands . - [ sniffs ] ¶ - [ gasps ] - [ grunts ] ¶ [ muffled thuds ] - [ sighs ] - That 's my property . I better get it back . - Hey , hey . Please just step back . Let us do our job . - Nice uniform , e-rep . - Yeah . It 's a good fit . - Nolan , I need to talk with you . - What is it ? - Kenya 's alive . I talked to her . I heard her voice . The v.C. Had her . I have to deliver mahsuvus alive , Or they 're gonna kill her . - Amanda , are you clean ? - Come on , I haven 't touched adreno in weeks . This is real , nolan . Kenya 's alive . Time is running out , and I 've been working On a plan to free mahsuvus , but I need your help . - No , mahsuvus is staying right where he is . What he 's got coming , he brought on himself . - That is not the deal , nolan ! - If kenya is alive , Then we 're gonna bring her home to you . Give me your hailer . - What ? - Amanda , you said it yourself , you 're running out of time . Give me your hailer , please . - So what 's the plan ? - Someone 's trying to extort amanda , Claims to be holding kenya prisoner . - And you believe that ? - Given what I 've been seeing lately , Anything 's possible . So our hailers are now tied to amanda 's . Blackmailer calls her , we get pinged . Hailers only have a limited range , so ... - We triangulate it . - Exactly . I 'm gonna head out to cuthbert ridge . You stay here and available . - Lots of sabrewolves out there . Let me go . - No , no way . No , you need to stay put until we get a handle On whatever it is that 's happening with you . I want you safe in defiance . - I 'm not safe anywhere . - Yeah , okay , but- - - And I can 't be killed . - Okay , but- - - And amanda needs you here . - What do you need ? - Keys would be nice . - Be careful . [ door closes ] - I know you will not fail me . [ door opens ] [ door closes ] - You do yourself a disservice by warning him . - Your opinions are , as always , welcome . - We will not stand for reconciliation . [ exhales ] - " we " ? - The men . We stood up to datak . - And I am very grateful for that . - He would forgive you and alak . Us , he would kill . We risked our lives taking your side . - A decision for which every new day Can be considered its own reward . - [ snarls ] - Eat ! - [ grunting ] [ tires skid ] - [ gasps ] [ breathing heavily ] Hello ? Hello ? [ branch cracks ] [ gasping ] [ struggling ] No ! No , no , no ! I 'm not here to hurt you ! - [ speaking native language ] - No , no , no ! Don 't ! - Who will save you now ? - You can gut me if you want , but I won 't die . [ both speaking native language ] - [ sniffs ] I know your smell . Why ? - I have visions . That 's what brought me here . It 's what brought you here . You and I- - we 're alike . No ! - [ grunts ] When I resist the hunger , I see a ship , the kaziri , crashing into earth . Then I wake up , standing over my victim . It 's terrifying . - I understand . - I am a monster . - No . You aren 't killing people . They wake up , and they 're okay , perfectly fine . - How- - how can you know that ? [ both grunt ] - ' cause I 'm the one who attacked you in angelarc . I 'm the one who started it all . - [ crying ] [ ratchet turning ] [ dramatic music ] ¶ [ both struggling ] [ yells ] [ engine sputters ] [ panting ] [ hailer ringing ] [ beep ] - I 'm working as fast as I can . - Amanda ! Don 't do it ! I got away . - It 's kenya . - Keep her talking . - Kenya ? Kenya , where are you ? Tell me what 's around you . What do you see ? - I don 't know .

Where is she ? - I wish I could tell you . - [ sighs ] I can 't waste any more time . I need to get him out . - And then what , hmm ? New york gets destroyed ? Kenya comes home , but amanda goes to jail ? One person 's life is not worth a thousand . - What if you got the call and it was your little girl ? - That 's a decision I hope I never have to make . - [ laughing ] - Can 't let you do something crazy , amanda . - [ sniffles ] You 're right . I 'm sorry . - No need to apologize . Come on , I got some v.C.- - [ yells ] - [ drops extinguisher ] Like I said , I 'm sorry . - Of everyone in this world , why come after me ? - I don 't know .

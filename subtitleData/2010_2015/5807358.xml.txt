 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously , on extant ... There will be violence , casualties ... Starting right here . Sorry I 'm late . You 've been spending A lot of time with this all-father of the gods . What do you actually know about this guy ? I know he minds his own business . Remember odin ? Sparks : We 're moving the offspring To the contingency site . The teams know what to do . Molly 's a viable threat to the offspring . But she is its mother . He sent me a message . It 's trying to speak to us . You were its host . I brought him here , and I 'm gonna Her husband john get him out ! Gave a presentation to your board today , But was denied funding . A gesture from you could put us closer to the family . ( deep whirring ) ( loud explosion ) ( gunfire ) I 'm s ... I 'm sorry , molly . I couldn 't let that thing live . Where is it ? Kern : Molly , if you can hear this , Get the hell out . ¶ I lost katie once . I can 't lose her again . No ... ( gunshot ) Oh , no , no , no . Katie ... Dad . He needs our help . ¶ Katie . Bloop ! ( giggling ) ( crying quietly ) ( low , labored breathing nearby ) ( clattering ) He 's scared . What does he want ? He wants you to help him . How ? He wants out . Out ? If you take him , I can come , too . Why the hell did you do that ? Talk to me , harmon . Or was that your plan ? To come down here and kill it ? I made a decision . Well , that wasn 't your decision to make ! Look around you . Look what it did here . You think these guys turned Their guns on each other for no reason ? It made them kill each other ! Maybe it was protecting itself . How do we know what these guys were down here doing to it ? I know what it did to me . This thing gets out in the world , More people will die . Well , that 's not Your call to make . It 's alive . It 's a living thing , okay ? It 's ... It 's your baby ? It is not your baby . It 's a nightmare . If you want to wait around here To sing it a lullaby , be my guest . ( computer trilling ) Computerized voice : Gordon kern . Containment protocol . I 'm sorry , molly . I can 't let you stand in the way . Harmon , no ! Harmon ! He 's pretty fried , huh ? He lost his purpose . Well , I don 't know about that . Just ' cause he 's busted up doesn 't mean he 's broken . Check this out . ( whirring ) Just like yours . Made of the exact same stuff . What happened ? I used to be a soldier . That was my purpose . And then when I lost my arm , they sent me home . I 'd been one thing for so long , I didn 't know how to be something else . You know what ? What ? I like this arm even better . I can do things I never could before , like ... Like this . Cool . Right ? They don 't call them " supers " for nothing . You could try , if you want . My dad said direct heat Could damage my sen-ceptors . Well , I never had a problem with mine . Your dad 's a clever guy . So ... Julie : There you are . I have your dinner waiting . Kern : Harmon ! Where 's molly ? She 's already out . What the hell happened down there ? Sparks figured it out when you used my fingerprints In the elevator . I had to do something . We were trapped . It doesn 't matter . By the time we got down there , it was gone . He took it . Sparks ? He drove off just as I was coming out . What did it look like ? I didn 't get a good look . Look , we got to get out of here . This place is gonna be crawling With cleanup crews any second . Come on . Sparks : Claypool 's been compromised Beyond repair . Hideki : The offspring ? It escaped its incubation chamber . I have no idea where it is . I suggest full contingency . Erase everything . Where are you ? I failed you one too many times . I apologize . I don 't think I 'm the right man for this job anymore . ( beeping ) ( sighs ) Thank you for your patience . What can I do for you ? My wife is in danger . I need your help . ( crickets chirping ) ( coyote howling ) Woman : I had to dig them out of storage , Just wish you 'd called ahead to let me know . I didn 't know myself . I 'm sorry . Oh , hush . I 'm just happy to see you again . It 's been too long . Well , I ... I understand , I do . When earl died , There were places I just couldn 't go anymore . Too many memories . You certainly had a lot of those here . That child must have run every inch of these woods , Barefoot , too . Bee sting every times . Tough cookie , that little katie . ( chuckles ) lord , that child was ... I 'm sorry . It 's all right . I 'm just a sentimental old woman . She always loved the red one . Could I put half a dozen of these on my bill ? Sure . Good night , esther . Good night . ( door closes ) He says that molly never came home . Nowak : It 's possible She 's still in the building . If she is , I want you to find her and bring her back . Alive . Understood . And the offspring ? We lost it when sparks disabled his car 's transponder . We 're working on it . Hideki : My apologies For the interruption . I have no idea how far this goes or who may be involved . Th-that 's why I came here . The isea , the police , the government , I-I don 't know who to trust . I 'm glad you felt you could come here . I just want her back safely . If what you 're saying is true , The world is about to change forever In very fundamental ways . We 'd be witness to a seismic shift in human history . You must find that intriguing , As a man of science . Well , right now , I 'm just a man trying to protect my family . Then perhaps It would be safer for ethan to join us here . No , no , I-I should be there , just in case She comes home . At least until we find molly And we know your family is out of danger . Please . I insist . ( grunts ) ¶ ( clicks ) ( clicks ) ( grunts ) He wants another one . ( low , labored breathing ) This place is better Than where we were . He doesn 't want to go back there . He doesn 't have to . Boop . I 'll be right back . Daddy . Can you leave the door open for us , just a little ? ( low , labored breathing ) ( hinges creaking ) ( low , labored breathing ) ¶ ( chirps ) ( low beep ) ( line ringing ) Verdisign : Incoming call from emergiflare cell . Oh ... Answer . Hello ? Sparks : Anya ? Alan ? What 's going on- - are you all right ? Oh , no , I 'm fine . It 's about katie . Please don 't do this again . It 's not fair , alan . Anya , wait . Please , just listen to me . Oh ... What is it ? There 's been a new development . What are you talking about ? I can 't tell you over the phone . I need you to come here . Alan . I promise , if you do this , I 'll never call you again . Where are you ? ( low , labored breathing ) ( low , labored breathing ) ( rustling ) Oh ! Oh ! ( sighs ) You scared the tar out of me . Well , is everything all right ? I thought I saw ruby prowling around . Ruby ? A coyote . Had a habit of getting into the cabins . Hadn 't seen her in a while . I thought she 'd moved on . Well , I 'm sure she 's gone by now . Why don 't you move into one next to the office ? I 'll be fine . Well , just make sure you close the door If you 're gonna go out for a leak . Odin : So we 're in this tent on the side of a mountain . And it 's hot all the time And there 's these mosquitoes The size of my fist . I had this friend , eddie , Used to sing all the time . At first , everyone just told him to shut up , But after a while , no one could sleep unless he sang . What would he sing ? Oh , you know , stupid songs . Songs he made up . Sometimes really old songs . And then , when he ran out of those , he 'd just ... Sing like animals . Like whales and raccoons ... Wolves . He was a funny guy . Sing me one . ( laughs ) You don 't want to hear me sing . Yes , I do . All right , your funeral . Wolf or whale ? Wolf . ( howling melody ) That 's not a song . Well , I told you , I 'm no eddie . I think I need a flip . A flip ? Every couple days , my dad changes my power core . Julie knows how . Well , she 's downstairs right now , So I could help you . Or I can get julie to do it . No . You can do it . All right . Well , you better walk me through it . There 's a panel on the middle of my back . Mm-hmm . Press on it . Oh , wow . That 's cool . You see the yellow one ? Mm . Take that one out And put the green one in . ( clicks ) ( clicks ) Now shut it . There you go . Julie : Odin ? He walked me through it . It was easy . It was like changing the oil on my bike . He 's a kid , he 's not a bike . I 'm sorry . Really . Come on , don 't get mad . You look really cute when you 're mad . I 'm not mad . You look a little bit mad . I 'm not . Come on . Look at you , you 're so full of Anger and rage right now , it 's ... Do you feel all right ? You 're so pent up . There 's steam coming out of your ears . Ethan ... He 's asleep .

Will you continue to use dr . Barton as your family liaison ? Affirmative . Then , upon receiving news of dr . Woods ' death Aboard the seraphim station , Dr. Barton will go to the woods ' home To notify the family and make arrangements . In the event that your corpse Is not in condition to be returned to earth , Can you verify your specific request for burial in space ? Molly : Yes . I request to be jettisoned . Dr. Woods , in the event that your wife 's corpse Is not recoverable , do you understand ... Can you stop calling it a corpse ? For god 's sake , people . I ... There 's a reason For the language of this simulation . I don 't give a damn about the reason . I mean , just stop calling it a corpse . John . I ... John . Excuse me . Excuse me . Just ... ( door opens , closes ) It 's all right . Take as much time as you need . Thank you . ( door opens , closes ) John ... I don 't want to talk about it anymore . About you not coming home .

Well , I don 't either , But we have to be prepared . Okay ? These are the risks . There are always risks , sweetheart , And this time is no different than any other . No , it is different this time . Don 't go . What ? Stay here . Stay home , stay with us . This could be my last time . I understand , I understand . It 's just that we-we 've ... I have a feeling we 've been doing so well this year . As a unit . I mean , I-it 's working . Well ... It 's not working for me . Not the way you want it to . What are you saying ? I know how badly You want all three of us to be a family , And I want that , too , But I can 't stand here and lie to you And tell you that I 'm feeling something That I 'm just not feeling . Okay , I can 't pass up This opportunity , john . It 's what I do . And , you know , maybe Having this time apart will actually do us some good . ( sighs ) Come on . I want us ... To matter as much as all of this does . ( sighs ) ( sighs ) ( beeping , clattering ) ( door opens ) all right , spread out . We 're clear . Hey .

What do you mean " strange " ? What happened ? Like there 's some part of her That still thinks it 's a real baby . ( sighs ) Well , it 's not a baby . Not anymore . It 's growing . Where was sparks taking it ? Claypool 's the only site I know of . But it doesn 't mean there aren 't others . Okay , we have to find them . Gordon , this is a Worst-case scenario . That thing is out in the world now . If it can do that to a dozen highly-trained Operatives in a basement , What 's gonna happen in a crowded train station Or a football stadium ? Let 's say we do track him ... We find sparks , We find the offspring . Then what ? We kill it . ( sighs ) I can try accessing the isea surveillance drones To locate his car . Do it . ( sighs ) The second I do this , they know where we are And they know we 're looking for him . Then we 'll have to be faster than them . ( crickets chirping ) Esther : That 's what I thought , too . Doesn 't make any sense , But I figured I ought to report it . ( sighs ) : Oh , I hear you . I got a guest here right now . Put a real damper on his trip If he got bit by a coyote . ( whispers ) : Damn . I got to go . He left the damn door open again . ( sighs ) ( cocks gun ) ( sighs ) Alan ! Alan , you in there ? ! Ruby girl ? If you in there ... You best git . Man : Esther .

They found the lab exactly as you said . But the building was empty , There was nobody there . I should go . Dr. Woods . No . She might already be home . Then she would have tried to contact you . Dodd : Excuse me . John , Your guests have arrived . Ethan 's here now . ( sighs ) stay until we know everyone is safe . I 've never been up this late . Yeah , I know . Where 's mom ? Uh ... She 'll be here soon . Why don 't you go lie down a bit . I 'm not tired . It 's still your bedtime . But I 'm not tired . Dodd : Uh ... How about a-a snack ? Do you eat snacks ?

( plastic rustling ) ( whirring , beeping ) ( plastic rustling ) ( screams ) ( nowak groans ) ( cocks gun ) don 't shoot me ! I know where your family is . What are you talking about ? My family 's at home . No ... They 're not . ( indistinct radio transmission ) Hello ? Mrs. W ? Got your message about the coyote . Esther ! Kryger : Perfect . We tracked him to a ditch . ( computer trilling ) A few more feet . Here . What now ? I don 't think he 'd turn around and go home , But I don 't know where else he 'd hole up . What is it ? I ran the vin number on sparks ' isea vehicle , But he owns a personal vehicle as well . Well , wouldn 't he just kill the transponder on that one , too . He doesn 't have it . His ex-wife does . She 's heading in the same direction . ( men shouting ) ¶ ( imitating engines ) Whoa ! Whoa , what is that ? That 's lucy . She 's a program right now , But eventually she 'll have a body like me . Oh , so she 's like your little sister , huh ? I guess . That your brain ? It 's like when I was a kid , My dad used to say to me , " what you got up there ? A bucket of bolts ? " I think that was his way Of letting me know that I wasn 't very smart . That doesn 't seem very nice . Yeah , well , he wasn 't a very nice guy . But I was young , so I-I believed him . And then I grew older , Became a soldier , And I realized that you know what , Parents don 't always know everything . Sometimes they can be wrong about a lot . You sure you don 't want a go ? I don 't think I should . Well , why not ? My dad would be angry with me . Why ? He told me not to ... He told you not to damage your sen-ceptors . Right ? And I promise you won 't . See ? I 'd never steer you wrong , buddy . Guys like you and me , We got to stick together . Right ? Esther ? Oh , my god . ( gasps ) ( grunts ) Katie : Stop ! He needs him . Why ? He 's hungry . I can get him food . Not that kind of hungry . ( grunts ) ( phone ringing ) I wouldn 't answer that . I think it 's time we had a talk . You took my baby from me ? We thought we could lessen the danger With it under our control . We were wrong . We took away the one thing it truly needed- - Its mother . And that didn 't occur to you When you were cutting it out of my body ? Or when you decided to lock it in some basement ? I made a mistake . Damn right you did . Now he 's out there with sparks . Alone , scared , Trying to defend himself . That 's why I 'm offering you my help . To do what ? To find it . After everything you 've done to me ? Why would I trust you ? We both want the same thing , molly . To see your baby live . I know how badly you want this . You made your way Into a heavily guarded facility last night . You risked everything . I 'm offering you another chance . Say I find him . Then what ? Bring him back . I have the resources to protect him And keep your family safe . Together , we can show the world His true potential . I can 't do that by myself . You don 't have to . Dr. Woods , Meet dr . Mason . It 's an honor . I 'm probably your biggest fan . Dr. Mason is an expert on theories Of extraterrestrial life . I also have a master 's in psychopharmacology And a doctorate in psychology . And that 's just what they give degrees in . More than that , I 'm a believer . I 'm on your side . I want to help you change the world . I don 't want to change the world . I just want to find my baby . Then let me help you . How do I find him ? Director sparks disabled The tracking device on his vehicle before he left town , But his ex-wife did not . I know where she 's going . That 's near a campsite called wimberley woods . They used to go there in the summer . ( groaning ) ( labored breathing ) ( sheriff whimpers ) ( muffled screaming ) Don 't worry , daddy . Everything is going to be fine . ( screaming continues ) ( screaming ) ( water fountain running , birds singing ) You okay ? I 'm fine . If anyone 's gonna find her , yasumoto ... Yeah . Yeah . ( sighs ) It 's gonna be okay . Hey , um , odin , he seems nice . He is . He 's crazy about you . ( scoffs ) I don 't know . Well , he 'd be crazy not to be . ( door closes ) Speaking of the devils , How was the tour ? Oh , it was great . Ethan . I 'm talking to you ; how was the tour ? It was great . ( phone ringing ) Molly ? John . Hey . Hi , sweetheart . Where are you ? I 'm okay . What 's going on ? Sparks is out there with the baby . I need to get him to a safe place . Okay , I 'll come with you . Stay where you are . Yasumoto is gonna send somebody with me . Yasumoto ? He has the resources To take care of the baby . He knows how important this is . Yeah , because I asked him to help , But this is not what I had in mind . I need to find him , john , And I can 't do it by myself . I just wish you 'd come to me instead . I know . I 'm sorry . I just didn 't have the time . Be careful . I will . Sorry . I 'm gonna need to take that . We don 't want anyone Tracking us . Element of surprise and all . Shall we ? Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

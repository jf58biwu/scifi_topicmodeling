 I feel like the play is saving my life right now . Everybody , this is Felix , my acting coach . Hello . - I killed Aynsley . - No ! We just need to prove that Donnie is really your monitor . - My old network . - Mommy ! Project LEDA ? I swear I don 't know who they are . You sold us to the Proletheans . You excited for our big adventure , monkey ? You did well to save her , Mark . She 's a mirror . See , her internal organs , they 're all reversed . It 's a brand-new day . Hi . All right , Fe ? Oh , yeah . I adore camping . It 's not really camping , is it ? More like sleeping in a truck . I slept in the bed of a flatbed . In my world , that 's considered camping . Otherwise known as homeless in the country . Hey . How much did Kira see of Barry birdwatcher 's , you know ... - Demise ? - Yeah . She didn 't see Siobhan take the shot , thank god . Jesus Christ . Our dear old mum 's a dead-eye with a riﬂe . It just makes me queasy . Yeah , she was cold , Fe . Like she 'd done it before . This is insane . It 's S , you know ? She makes tea and she taught me piano . Oh , bloody hell ! Come on ! That 's ... Don 't laugh . Is it bad ? Disgusting . - No ! - What 's so funny ? - Uncle Felix camping is funny . - No , I 'm not . God , I 'm going to have to wash my whole foot . Okay , look , we need to get to civilisation . Sorry , Henrik . - Shouldn 't have put my faith in them . - Nah . Nobody said it was going to be easy , Mark . Just going to have to work with what we 've been given . - Helena . - Mmm-hmm . Light ' em up . When are we going to get breakfast ? We 'll get you something . Now , yeah ? Well , I would have happily taken us to that last greasy spoon , but Mummy threw my visa card out the window . Because they might track us . Hey , kiddo . Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey . Hey , little missy , did you , uh , did you forget something ? Because you kinda gotta pay for it first . I don 't have any money . Hey . There you are . Yeah , look , somebody forgot to pay for something . So ... Oh . Kira , I told you to wait till I gave you money . Didn 't I ? Sorry about that . I think that should ... I got it . Sorry . You got it ? Okay , thanks . - No problem . - Is that good ? - Yeah . - Yeah . Okay . Sorry . - Yeah . - Bye . Well . Yeah . What are you doing here , Angie ? Got something that might tempt you out of obscurity . Let me guess , you went to the hospital after I told you not to . Hey , you still got it , Art . And guess what ? That Shakira-haired lookalike ? Gone . Poof . Surveillance shows some guy wheeling her out . Who ? No ID on either one of them . Yet . Sit your ass down , Angie . No , I think I 'll stand , Art . I told you , let it go . If you don 't , I will go to Hardcastle myself and tell him you 're still after it . You know you 're letting down two partners now , right ? Me and Beth . Well , I mean , it was just a complete disaster , you know . It was like my worst nightmare , not having done my hair for picture day . Hey , baby , that thing we did at the store , we don 't do that unless we have to , yeah ? I know , Mom . Just go get your stuff from the truck . Careful . You know , I 've been in this area before . When ? There was loads of cabins and summer houses . We 'll just find an empty one and we 'll hole up for a bit . She needs a proper bed , Fe . Okay - Alison ? Hey , stop . Alison , come on . Oh . What are you doing here ? Why aren 't you at work ? I told you , Susan Teller is in Austin this week . So your boss is away . That 's why you 're playing hooky ? - Uh , yeah . - Hmm . Hey , honey , the other day with Sarah Stubbs in the cemetery ? I 'm worried is all . You 've been so wound up . And I know ... Well , you 've got that big dress rehearsal tomorrow , right ? - Who 's my little star ? - That is not helping . Well , why don 't you sit down right here and let me relax you ? You know , morning 's my best time . I just showered . This is nice , hey ? Doesn 't look like anybody is around . Oh , looks well-appointed . Okay , let 's have a look . Hmm . I don 't know , bachelor , maybe ? A photographer . Dr Cormier , look at you waltzing into Leekie 's office whenever you want to . Well , yeah , only when he is away . But he 's away a lot and I like it in here . We should mess with his like little bioenergy hobby farm . I 'm going to put like an electric eel in one of these tubes . He 'll be like , " Great Scott , " I 've created life itself . " Cosima ? - What ? - Come here . - What ? - I just found out . I think you have the right to see this . All right . I just want to show you . - Oh , whoa . - Hi . Who is that ? I 'm Jennifer Fitzsimmons . I 'm a teacher and swim coach at Sheldon High . So , uh , they asked me to keep this video journal because they 've found polyps on my lungs . I was having trouble breathing and went in for tests and ... Yeah . Unidentified polyps . Jennifer was the first to show symptoms , six months before Katja Obinger . We have hours of these tapes . Is she all right ? She died . Three days ago . - I 'm sleeping here tonight . - Oh ! Me , too ! Felix already called it . No , he didn 't . - When are we going to see Mrs S again ? - I don 't know . I was wondering the same . She protected us , though , didn 't she ? Even though she was lying ? Hey , well , I 'll protect you now . I know I wasn 't always around but I 'm here now . Nothing bad is going to happen to you . All right ? Stop , no ! Yeah , just out by county line here . Probably abandoned . Plates have been removed . I got a VIN number , though . You ready ? All right . India , Foxtrot , Alpha , nine , Charlie ... Look at her , Gracie . Men schemed for years to build her but only God can make her fertile . You think far too highly of her . Grace is your name ? Yes . Why am I here ? Father says he wants you to join our family . I 've already got a family . You 're barely even human . I have a twin . Sestra . Where is Tomas ? Gone . My dad said back to Europe and the Dark Ages . Good riddance . Hey , Sarah , wake up . Someone 's here . They 're coming . No , we 've got to go . Now . - Run ! - Felix . - Hey ! - Hey ! Hey ! Ca I , Ca I , Ca I. Sarah ? You know him ? What the hell are you doing in my house ? We were in a bind . We broke in . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . - A bind ? - No . You 've got so much nerve . The last time I saw you , you took ten grand and my car . You brought us to the house of one of your marks ? - Are you insane ? - Hey , hey . - Felix , relax , relax . - One of your marks ? Felix , foster brother and an avowed pacifist . Sure , no of fence , but get out . I don 't want to know you . - Cal , please . Cal , please ! - Get out ! Mommy , what 's going on ? Oh , baby , come here . Come on . Are you okay ? Why did you get scared ? I 'm sorry , it 's just ... It 's just Cal . He 's an old friend . Yeah . Well , actually , I 'm not . You okay ? Are you my dad ? Blow me down . - Is this a scam ? - Right . You 're with a cute little girl and she goes , " Are you my daddy ? " And I get fleeced again ? It 's not a scam , Cal . I was here with you for a month . The timing 's right . She 's yours . You 're killing me . Look , I didn 't come here for a father figure for my kid . No ? I just needed a place to sleep . That 's it . Well , what kind of shit are you into now ? We 're going to leave . We 're going to get our stuff . We 're going to go . - Great . Walk away . - Yeah . - Yeah . - It 's your specialty , isn 't it ? Hold on , hold ... I 'm not going to kick this little girl out on the street . You can spend another night if it helps you out . - All right ? - Thank you . Just don 't steal anything . ♪ Blood in the bathroom ♪ Blood in the shower ♪ Covers the tiles and the bathroom mat ♪ And did you know the thing that 's really strange ♪ The police do not arrange to clean the mess , they take the body ♪ And the family in distress is left to deal with the splatter ♪ How they feel doesn 't matter ♪ And there 's no one you can call to help you through it - ♪ Thank God , you 're here ... ♪ - Okay , okay , okay . Okay . That 's great . That 's great . That 's great . - Alison . - Hmm . Let 's save that beautiful instrument for the audience . Okay ? Guys , let 's just do the dialogue . Okay ? Dialogue only . Holy ! Fiddlesticks . Sorry . Sorry , I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . Um , I 'm locked out of my car . My phone 's inside . Can I borrow yours to call my husband at the office ? Oh , yeah . Um ... - Been there . - You 're a life-saver . Oh , I love your kicks . Do you live nearby ? Uh , yeah . Black Oak Drive . - Oh , Hilldale Crescent . I 'm Angie . - Alison . Hey Laura , it 's me . Is he in ? - Did you say Hillsdale Drive ? - Yeah . - Oh , I 've never seen you before . - We just moved in . Hey , hon , it 's me . Brain cramp over at the community centre . Um , I locked myself out of the car . Can you bring me the spare key ? You 're the best . Half an hour . Hey , can I buy you a cup of coffee as a thank-you ? No , I have to pick up my kids . Okay , no worries . Um , maybe some other time . I know I should have told you but , um , I wanted you all to myself . But you always left . You know , I never had a real mum and dad . - Yea h ? - Yeah . When I was your age , it made me very angry . And I was , um , so confused . And I don 't want that for you . I guess I brought you here because there 's two parts of you . Yeah ? One of them is me and one is your dad . Do you get that ? Do you like Cal ? Yeah . A long time ago , I liked him very much . I like his beard . Make yourself at home . Sorry . I 'm not snooping . Just wandering . Uh-huh . Listen , I am intimately acquainted with my sister 's bullshit . My concern is for Kira . Whatever you 're angling for , man , just ask . Good . Okay , who are you ? Sarah must have come back here for a reason , so what is this ? What exactly do you do ? It 's what I did . - Pollinators . - Sorry ? Mini-drone pollinators for areas where bee populations have crashed . I designed the micro-optics . But my partners forced me out and sold the technology to the military . Now they kill people from bases in Virginia with it . But I don 't . Moralist with money . Perfect mark . For child support ? She already robbed me once . The bad news is the cough is getting worse . But the amazing news is Dr Aldous Leekie of the Dyad Institute says he can help . So , they 're going to fly me out for the treatment , thanks to this amazing guy . Come . This is Greg , my amazing boyfriend . - O h , my god . - Our new semester starts today . Halle sent me a picture of the new class . They look like a good group . That 's enough . You 've seen all of it . - That 's her monitor , right ? - Yeah . Sometimes I forget that you 're mine . That 's good . He kept her completely in the dark . She had this total fake hope . It 's not fake . Not for any of us . The fact that she was naive did not compromise her treatment . You know , we are telling you everything now but if you can 't handle it ... - I can handle it . Don 't be a bitch . - That 's what I thought . Better get ready . What the hell am I doing ? I 'm going to die here . You brought us here on purpose . You wanted Kira to meet her father . I didn 't even know he 'd be here , Fe . Bollocks ! That is bollocks , Sarah , and you know it . For eight years , eight years you pretended you didn 't know who he was ? You let me narrow it down to Ziggy the drummer or that guy you met in Orange County at that bar . You knew the whole time . Look , after yesterday , stealing to feed Kira ... We were in the area , I just ... I knew it was time to ... You are a bloody wrecking ball . You are an exploding cigar . Do you know that ? Just let me patch things up with Cal . He 's a good guy , Fe . - I bet he is . - He is ! Resourceful , big firm biceps ... Yeah , he 's completely disconnected from all this shit we 're dealing with . I think Kira deserves something ... Something nourishing . For once . Even just for a few days . Yeah . No , you 're right . She just met her father , you can 't yank her away . But Uncle Felix isn 't going to be babysitting while you negotiate custody . Come on , Fe . I 've got other drama in my life , Sarah . Alison 's musical opens tomorrow . She needs me . There 's no place for me here . There 's nothing more to say , except goodbye to Kira . You ready ? I take it you did a rotation in pathology , - Dr Cormier ? - I did . Then ... - Are you okay ? - Mmm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Okay , are you fine to help me with this ? Because I ... Yeah , yeah , yeah , I 'm fine . So , as you can see , the intestine has been tied off . - So I 'm going to cut it free . - Yeah . What are those sores , um , - on her lips ? - Oh , look . From the treatment . The same reason she lost her hair . So it 's not Wegener 's granulomatosis ? Or Churg-Strauss Syndrome ? It 's got to be autoimmune , right ? Yes , but unclassified . And immunosuppressives had limited effect . Look , on the uterine wall . The growths , they 're more pronounced , more mature . So this could mean that they have originated in the uterus and spread from there . That could be the cause of her infertility ? Possibly . No . Right now is not a good time . Sorry , it 's my mom , I have to ... Sorry . I 'm kind of in middle of it . Red alert , Cosima , I 've just been approached by another monitor , which means they know I know about Donnie which means you definitely can 't trust Delphine . That 's complicated . Complicated ? My play opens tomorrow . - Your play . - Don 't belittle me , Cosima . Felix is gone , Sarah is gone . You and I are the only ones who can hold down the fort now . Look , I 'm having enough trouble holding down my own fort today . Sorry to bother you with the very crucial information that I 'm being double-monitored . I 'm sorry . Okay ? Uh ... just go through the motions with Donnie , okay ? Break a leg , or whatever . I 'll call you tomorrow . Okay ? Unless Delphine blackbags you into the back of a SUV and puts you in a rabbit cage somewhere . Then I 'll never speak to you again . - Hey , you . - Hey ! Hatha yoga today . It 's mostly an older crowd but at least I don 't get hipster dudes staring at my ass , right ? So , you must be in that play that starts today ? Look , I know what you 're doing , Angie , if that 's even your real name . So , you can just go back to your bosses and tell them it didn 't work . Okay , wait . Wait . You 're right . Okay - I 'm a police officer . Yeah , like Beth . So , why don 't you tell me about that , huh ? How about Sarah Manning ? Look , I can help you . But you 've got to tell me what you know . You stay away from me . Well , she 's out like a light . She wanted me to say goodnight . You know , back then when you left , it took me a long time to admit to myself that I 'd been played . Yeah , well ... What you don 't know is that I already had all your bank codes and passwords . I was going to take you for everything you had selling your company . Why didn 't you ? You just made it ... hard . I 'm not that person any more , Cal , but I 'm still just as much trouble . - Get down . - What ? Hide . Local cop . You want to say hi ? Hey , Tom ! Great to see you , man . - Cal . - How 's that spey rod working out ? Oh , I don 't know how you cast that thing , 16 feet long . I spend half the day tangled in the bushes . You know you 're supposed to use it on the water , right ? Right . So , uh , what 's going on ? Oh , bunch of nothing probably . Some shoplifters hit up the store . Mom with a little girl - and another guy . - Yeah ? I found a stolen truck just down the way . May be connected , not sure . Huh . Well , it 's been all quiet here since I got back last night . Yeah , well ... You know , I 've never asked any questions about why you moved here . Or about the little weed patch you got out back . Come on , man . Look , all I 'm saying is I 'd like to think you can trust me by now . Tom . If I thought there was anything you should know , I 'd tell you . Good enough . - Night . - See you later . Huh . I shouldn 't have put you in that position . - Listen , come on , it 's all right . - No . He 's a friend . He 's not going to say anything . He 's gone . - No , no , no . We 're gone , too . - Now ? - Yeah . - Kira 's sleeping . Yeah , well , she 's used to it . Come on. just hold on . Where are you going to go ? Just , I don 't know , somewhere . - Tell me what 's going on here . - It 's not your problem . - You 're safe here . - I can 't trust that , Cal . Then trust me . Can 't you stop running for a minute ? ♪ Meow , meow , meow ♪ Okay , troupe . Troupe , lets gather . Kelsie . Everyone , Alison ? Alison ? - Sorry . - Let 's gather . Everyone join hands , please . Okay . Today 's performance is dedicated to our dearly departed Aynsley . Aynsley , we know you 're with us . And we are going to do you proud . - For Aynsley . - For Aynsley .

Honey , are you okay ? Ali ? Oh , my God ! You don 't want to confuse Kira , huh ? Good intuition . I guess that 's where she gets it . - Coffee ? - Yea h . Name 's Peter White , a detective from Gresham . Looking for a little girl in a custody case . May be with a dark-haired woman in her twenties , British accent ? They stole a truck that was up here . Yeah , yeah . They were here yesterday . They distracted me while some new-waver stole a bunch of food . New-waver , huh ? Sounds like them . Any idea where they might be headed ? I hear you 're not happy with our plans for Helena ? - She doesn 't belong here . - No , you 're scared . I understand that . But what do we say about fear ? Doubt 's first cousin , am I right ? You have doubts , Gracie ? - No . - Come here . Close your eyes . What do you hear ? - The wind . - Mmm-hmm . - The men working . - Him . You hear Him , don 't you ? - Yes . - Yeah . Gracie , you 're my firstborn . But Helena does have a soul , she does have a purpose . And she is going to be a part of our family now . That 's what tomorrow is all about . I 'm guessing you 're the detective been asking questions in town . Yeah . Sorry I didn 't pop by to say hello - but time is of the essence . - Hmm . Any help you could provide would be much appreciated . Well , if the folks you 're looking for were still around , they 'd be in custody . Guess I 'll be on my way , then ? Probably best . - Last card . Uh-oh ! - I win ! - Oh , no . - You shark , you . - You beat him . She beat you . Can I go feed the chickens again , Cal ? Sure , go for it . Those are going to be some fat chickens . You going to tell me what 's going on ? No . I 'm not going to put that shit on you . Mommy ! What 's that mean ? Mommy ! Mommy ! Kira ! She 's fine . Just get in the car and she 'll say that way . Don 't ... Don 't hurt her . Get back in the house , Cal ! He 's got nothing to do with this . - Yeah , he does now . - Kira ! Kira , run ! - Mommy ! - Take her inside , Cal . - Get off ! Get off ! - Mommy ! You shot up a cop ? Are you mad , man ? Ten thirty-three . Ten thirty-three . Get up ! Get up ! Tom , Tom , do you copy ? Ca I ! - Send out the girl . - No ! Not going to happen . Take me . Please , just take me . Please . Who 's this ? Get in . You 're driving . Get in ! Miracle on top of miracle . Although we are small in rank , we have broken away from the old world because we know what they do not . Man 's work is God 's work , as long as you do it in God 's name . Helena was created by man , not in His name . But God shone his light down upon her . Shh-shh-shh . You are hereby bound together before God . Lord , we are asking you as simply as we can , reclaim Helena from eternal damnation . Bless us with your bounty . We are your instruments in the war for creation . - Amen . - Amen . - Where did you get this ? - I 'm not telling you shit . Yeah , I have Sarah but not the girl . Look , don 't worry , I know who she 's with . We have another problem here , she has a photo . Project LEDA , ' 77 . We 'll be back in eight hours . Look , Kira 's got nothing to do with this . She 's your daughter . You touch her and I will bury you . Just drive . I demand to speak to Dr Leekie right this second . You 're trespassing , Detective Bell . - Dad , it 's awake . - She 's part of the family now , Gracie . Henrik ! Does that mean that Mrs S knew the whole time ? What else is she not bloody telling us ? Twenty years ago you brought an orphan to my door . She 's the key to all of this . Ripped By mstoll

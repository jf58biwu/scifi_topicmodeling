! - you work in a lab at next corporation . - what is that ? - it 's a government-contracted lab focused on the study of chromosomes , okay ? - what did i do there exactly ? - you were one of their leading geneticists . before kevin died , you 'd been working 100-hour weeks . - it had been a while since you 'd seen your family . - are you all right ? why didn 't she want to see me ? - because you were driving . kevin was riding his bike and you were driving and you hit him . and that 's how it happened . yeah . - is it okay if i lie down ? - and when do results come in ? mm . i said thursday . - not thursday . we have some real problems here . - tomorrow ? it just doesn 't seem reasonable . i didn 't say it was unreasonable . i said it didn 't seem reasonable . we agreed on thursday , and i 'd like to stick to that if we can , okay ? - i don 't care what we agreed to . - okay . okay. tomorrow . make it out to archer . thank you . okay . bye . i 'll have to step out for a while , william . stay here . don 't go outside . i just don 't think you 're ready is all . if you need anything or if anything happens , just pick up the telephone and dial these numbers and call me . william , you put this cereal in a bowl with milk , and that 's how you eat cereal . okay . - cellular degeneration dates this proxy at exactly the same age as the prototype . we grafted the telomerase protein and used it as an rna template like you said . same results every time. look . cell division rate is perfect . they 're pretty much exact clones in every physical way . they 've got the same blood pressure , same brain function , same response time , but ... we 've run into some other issues . massive brain tumors have developed in 7 / 10 of them . - 70 % have brain tumors ? and how long do they live ? - they 're not gonna make it a month . - i hate to do this to you on your first day back , but we have some visitors from upstairs . - what do you mean " upstairs " ? - they 're down here to talk about what has become a very sensitive issue . - what do you mean ? - and i need you to cooperate with them . a set of samples from the second round of splicing along with some corelle solution has gone missing ... that and some human eggs . - missing ? how ? - uh ... - hello ? - i 'm coming home . i 'm gonna make it right . - i don 't understand . - i 'm sorry . i never should 've left you . - you sound different . are you okay ? - i 'm done running away . - hello ? - they 're just making sure that it was no one from the staff . answer their questions . - but why would they think it 's ... it doesn 't make sense . wait. stop . - gentlemen . - william , it 's good to have you back . - morning . - this is tom . - tom. tom langley ... spenning , brag , and penn . - i 'm william blakely . - we just need a few answers on this . - on what ? - sorry , what 's the question ? - you said you needed a few answers on this . - they 're talking to everyone , william . they 're just taking through the staff , trying to make sure that no one ... but dr. blakely runs our research lab . - you 're a company man , right , william ? - he 's one of our ... - excuse me ? - corelle ... it 's a cloning agent , right ? - that 's correct . - you took last week off . is that right ? - dr. archer , i don 't understand what ... - four samples of corelle are missing from specimen 29 . - that surprise you , william ? - does that surprise me ? - hey , how 's that stuff work , anyway ? - it , uh , stabilizes an amino acid sequence in the q-45 ... - that must be worth millions on the open market if someone were selling . - what are you saying ? what are you trying to say ? - what am i trying to say ? - if you 're saying what i think you 're trying to say , there 's a very serious insinu ... it 's a very serious accusation . - william , wait. william , no . - dr. archer , it 's an accusation . it 's an accusation . - william , no , how long have we known each other ? - it 's an accusation . he 's accusing me . - please , seven years . william is one of our most trusted ... - i signed a 206-c . you under ... you know that next corporation 's secrets are safe with me . - william , no . - i 'm sure that they are . what about the other people that you work with ? - i 've spent the last seven years of my life working around the clock , and you 're telling me that because of a lapse in a multimillion-dollar security system , that somebody has walked out the front door with proprietary information regarding the first round of telomerase slicing . do you have any idea the months of work it takes to create 12 ounces of corelle ? do you even know what it 's capable of ? - i don 't know. i don 't care . - dr. archer , i don 't understand . - william , william . all right , william , thank you . - dr. archer . - thank you for coming in . - we 're going to go ahead and ... - we 'll see you soon . - i 'll ... i 'll be in touch . - who is that man ? who is that man ? what is his name ? - he , uh ... he is just from ... - what is his name ? - okay . - william , what are you doing ? - who are you ? where 's my family ? where is my family ? - calm down . - sit down . sit in the chair . - o-okay . - sit down ! - okay . - hands out in front . - william , calm down . watch the g ... watch the gun . be careful , william . be careful . be careful . - quiet. quiet. quiet. quiet . just tell me the truth . just tell me the truth . that 's all . - i work in a genetics lab . a research project focused on the ... - what does this have to do with me ? - ... a controlling agent . - where is my family ? ! where is my family ? ! - you don 't have a family . you don 't have a family . my lab , the lab where i work not extending people 's lives , but making them older , faster , then recording and implanting learned behavior ... facial recognition , image memory , language , like loading up a computer with data . - why ? - because we want to make clones ... replacements . proxies . you are a proxy , william . you are my proxy . - get up . get up . go. go. go. go. go . go up the stairs . go up the stairs . go up the stairs ! don 't sit down ! go up the stairs ! - no , this is ridiculous , william . - go up the stairs ! get up and go up the stairs ! - no . - get up . - stop , stop , stop ! stop ! william , think through this . what do you think has happened ? don 't you realize that if they find out what we 've done , it 's over ? william , no . what are you doing ? what are you doing ? stop . - lie back. lie back. quiet . lie back . - okay , okay , okay . - put your feet under the straps . under the straps . let 's go. under. under. under . - what are you doing ? what are you doing ? where are you going ? - i am going to find her . to find her . - and to find out who i am . - no. no ! - william ? i saw you from the bus . are you following me ? - yes. no . i wanted to see you . - well , you see me . you ... you want to ask me to get coffee or something ? - yes . yes , i do . or we could get ice-cream sandwiches . okay . - you 're beautiful . i didn 't know . i saw the photos , but ... you really are . - you okay ? - yeah . - i have to go , okay ? - okay . - hello ? no , i 'll be there . i 'm fine , yeah . i understand . no , i said ... what i said was it would take a few days . that 's the nature of time off , isn 't it ? suspicious ? suspicious ? no , i 'm here , yeah . mm-hmm . - all right . - well , there 's actually something i wanted to talk to you about , too . no , i think we should meet in person . thank you , dr. archer . - take care of yourself . - okay . - ah , baxter , can you lock up tonight ? - sure . - the men from upstairs are gonna be here pretty early . - okay . - did you notice anything odd about william tonight ? - why ? - uh , oh , he just , um ... um , i 'm going to meet with him . - this late ? - yeah , it sounded urgent . is this one from specimen 29 ? - yeah , he 's the last one . dr. archer , can i ask you something ? why is it you still work here at next corp ? - you know , i look at this dog , and i think , " life is the whim of several billion cells to be you for a while . " - what 's that from ? - cant ' remember . baxter , you don 't just quit a job like this . - why ? - you just don 't . - okay . don 't start the car . i just want to take a minute to explain what 's been going on . - you mean ... you mean with you ? - no , with the samples . - all right . william , what 's been going on with the samples ? - i know you 've been concerned with the men from upstairs . - william . these guys are not joking around , all right ? internal special security . the entire department ... they can shut it down just like that if they want to . they will not hesitate to put us down . and i 've given you every opportunity . i have defended you . i 've given people my word . i 've backed you at every turn , william , but your behavior is increasingly suspicious . william ... the best move is for you to come clean . - you were the only one who was kind to me . - all right . - i thought to myself , " what a kind man . " - right , william ... - stop interrupting me . i talk now . and i didn 't understand why you were being so nice to me . - and then i realized that it was because next corporation needed william blakely . they were afraid of william blakely . - good . good job . good , william . we are gonna deal with this . i am your friend . i will help you out . - don 't touch it. sit back . - what do you think you 're gonna do ? what do you think you 're gonna do ? - i 'm going to leave . - what are ... no one leaves next corporation . - i do . - william ? william ? - i told you everything you needed to know . except it 's not your life , it 's my life . you have to understand . i ... i lost a child . i was responsible . my life ended that day , so ... - how old am i ? - 15 months since inception . you 've been alive for 6 . i didn 't mean to hurt you . i just wanted to fix something . - but what if i don 't want to be william blakely ? - you have to . - you have to do this . i need you to do this . jules needs you to do this . - okay . okay . but you have to go . you have to leave . you can 't stay here . you have to go . - i 'll leave tomorrow . - okay . jules . jules . jules , i 'm sorry . i didn 't know h ... - william , not right now , okay ? i mean , what is this ? what do you want ? - i just didn 't have any ... i 'd have no one else . - you can 't just show up to my bus stop and just expect me to , like , relate to you , right ? the world doesn 't stop just because decide that you don 't want to be a part of it . it 's just not fair . - jules , i 'm not trying to upset you . i just don 't have anyone else to reach out to right now . - well , you are upsetting me , william . - please , all i 'm asking is a minute of your time . - what did you just say to me ? - l-l-listen , jules . please , wait . - no. no , no , no , no . you don 't get to say that to me . all i had was time . you weren 't there . - i 'm so ... - no , okay , i get it. i get it . is this about kevin ? - i don 't know. i 'm sorry . - what ? you ... you want to talk about kevin ? is this what it 's about ? do you know what i do ? do you know what this is ? i carry this around . this is his hair from his first haircut . i think that i deserve him back in some ways . - you do deserve that . i believe you do deserve that . - no. there is no deserve . there are no moral order to any of this . we don 't get paid back for the pain that we felt . there 's none of that shit . i was willing to go on with you . you caved. you ran away . - but i 'm here now . i can 't answer for that , but i am here now . - mm . - i promise you. i am here . - i just see him when i look at you . - but why not make that a good thing ? - i can 't . - hello ? - hello , william. william ? - yeah , i 'm here . - next corporation has called three times this morning looking for you . if you 're going to be william blakely , you need to go to the lab . you need to go to work , william . - hey , william . - william , take a walk with me ? have you seen archer this morning ? he was a no-show for the q1 budget report . - no , i didn 't see him . - well , when you see him , could you tell him to stop by , please ? - yeah , i 'll tell him . - have you circled up with baxter yet ? - no , i have not seen baxter . - some interesting news with specimen 29 . - okay . i 'll talk to baxter about specimen 29 . - you okay ? - yeah. are you ? - yeah , i 'm good . - i 'm gonna go . baxter ? - hey , dr. blakely . - how are the ... the dogs ? - this is the last one from specimen 29 . the tumor spread faster than we anticipated . - the tumors ? - the brain tumors . - i don 't know what it is that you do , what you 've got going on in here , but , um , i 'm done playing games . - i-i 'm sorry . i don 't ... i don 't know what you 're talking about . - a man has a right to his privacy . i get it. i respect it . but as your neighbor , i have a duty to report any suspicious activity , okay ? - look , i think we got off on the wrong foot . i 'm william . - i know. we 've met. lester . - i know that what i do here might seem strange , but i think we 're just going a little burb crazy out here . - i 'm a geneticist . i work for next corporation . you know , the big building downtown and the slogan , " building a better tomorrow one cell at a time . " i could ... i could show you what we do . it 's very interesting . i 'll make some coffee . get out of the cold . come on . so , you do science and stuff ? - yeah , i do science . come on in . - two others died last night and one yesterday . - they 're dying ? - that has a tendency to happen when you have a brain tumor , doctor . apparently , when you clone a clone , you get all these weird anomalies like brain tumors , blindness . - blindness ? - yeah , they 've all gone blind in the late stages . - did you say " clone a clone " ? what do you mean ? i should go . - are you doing all right , dr. blakely ? - whoa . - yeah , there we are . - that 's pretty well-hidden . - well , listen , would you like to see ? head on down , and i 'll get a piece of gear that makes it work . there 's a light switch right down there at the bottom of the landing . i 'll be right back. go ahead . you got to see. it 's great . - sure . hey , william ? p-please , william . i ... i think i broke my neck . - you 're a curious man , lester . - i had a breakthrough yesterday . i ... i used to be afraid of people . i used to run from them . but i realized that might not be the right approach . - i was born on the other side of that door in a bathtub . it took him months of trial and error and he killed the defects and buried them in the backyard under the snow . and then he made me . i was designed to learn fast . exponential brain growth . i learned things in leaps and bounds . tried to make a better version of himself ... - let me tell you a joke . - ... without the guilt ... - knock , knock . - ... but it backfired ... - knock , knock ? - ... because he had made a mirror , and it became a constant reminder of who he was and what he had done . - don 't cry. it 's just a joke . - i don 't understand . - never mind. it 's just a joke . use this spoon to eat your cereal . - he had convinced himself that i was ready ... that i was ready to go it alone , to do it myself . but i knew the real reason was that he was sick of me . he was sick of the sight of me , the sight of himself , every day , everywhere he looked . ... and so , he left me . he abandoned me . he left me with a black book , a survivor 's guide ... maps and credit cards and histories , information about his wife , his wife ... how to find her and help her . it took me two weeks to run out of food ... and then i went out into the world . i was starving . and i was arrested 24 hours later in a grocery store . i was terrified . he 'd told me the world was a good place , but that was a lie . the world is a cruel place , and i didn 't belong . they processed me . they categorized me . they classified me . they told me i was delusional , schizophrenic , a danger to myself and others . when they did this , i would go to a place far away , like a recurring dream that i would escape to . and i 've been trying to find that place , to go back there , ever since . and i 'm closer now than before . i 'm as close as i 've ever been , okay ? next corporation found me in three months . they had searched everywhere . they needed me back to continue the work , and i came back here . and i was alone , totally alone . i had nothing , no one . and i decided to follow his lead . and i made a proxy . and that makes me invisible , unaccountable . i 'm going to disappear like he disappeared , and no one will come after me . before i leave , i 'm going to make sure that he will never forget me again . he 's going to understand what it feels like to hurt the way i hurt . so this is my breakthrough . taking a human life is easy for me because i 'm different . - i 'm not even human . i 'm better than that . - william , i didn 't do anything to you ! please , no ! - you 're baxter , right ? - i 'm sorry , what ? - you 're a company man , right , baxter ? - what ... what ... what do you guys want ? - i can count on you to help me out , right ? - you talked to archer last night before he left . what did he tell you ? hi , jules. hi . hi , jules , would you like ... do you have time this afternoon to come here ? it 's amazing to see you . you look amazing . hi , jules . do you have time to come over here and talk about ... come on in . coffee ? water ? you want to see some footage ? we owe that to each other . we owe that to kevin , jules . i have shots of every ... and kevin , i have stuff of kevin . no , i know. i know . don 't cry . i don 't like it , either . don 't cry . you remember that one time we were on the beach together ? if you could just give me a chance . it 's true. it 's true . i agree with you . no , i 'm not laughing at you , and i 'd like to talk to you . i don 't like it , either . i feel ... i feel like we owe it to each other to be better . - pick up. pick up. pick up . pick up. pick up . - hello ? - william ? - hi . - hi . listen , uh , we can 't do this anymore . we need to finish it . i want a divorce . hello ? - no , i ... i agree . i 'm glad you called . do you have time today to come over here and talk to me ? and we can just sort of sit and talk about the next steps ? - okay , what 's your address ? - " to whom it may concern , jules braxton-blakely " will be my wife forever and always to eternity . " but since the loss of our only son , kevin , " our lives have been utterly empty . " but our love will not end with her death . " love is stronger than that . " may god have mercy on our souls . william blakely . " hello . - i just found out what 's going on . i can 't understand why you would do this . - yeah . tough break . - listen to me . - it 's funny how sometimes things just work out like they 're supposed to . your friend is on her way over here now , and we 're going to have a nice chat . goodbye . come on in . thank you . step in here . - reminds me of your old grad-school place . - yeah . - the one on braeburn ? - mm . - how long have you been here ? - i moved here a while ago . it feels like forever ago . in the middle of nowhere . - yeah , it 's the middle of nowhere . - what year was your father born ? - my father ? - answer the question . - 1942 . - what 's your wife 's maiden name ? - braxton . - you had a brother , an identical twin . he died when you were 4-years-old . what was his name ? dr. archer was found dead in his car last night with the corelle solution . - dr. archer ? i have to go now . - i know what you are . what the hell is wrong with you ? you , don 't move . i need to see the two of you outside right now . - baxter ! - so , then what do you want ? just tell me . i 'm your friend . you can talk to me . none of this is your fault . - how would any of this be my fault ? - i shouldn 't have come here . - wait. jules , wait. wait. wait . - no , i feel stupid . this is not a good idea . - before you came , i was watching footage ... old footage of you and me and kevin , too . it helped me . it gave me perspective . i think you should watch it with me now . i think it 's important to do that . come on . - about seven months . the fuck have you been doing for four years ? - i wanted to disappear . but i realized that i was stuck with myself ... with this body , these memories , and it felt like jail . - no. no . just come here . - daddy ! just admit this is what you want . let me get you some water or something . okay . - go on. not too fast . - you rolling ? - yeah . mm-hmm . - you getting this ? - i got it , babe . show me what you got . - william , what are you doing here ? - you lied to me . - you want her to hear us ? huh ? what 'd she think ? you think she loves you ? i promise you ... - stop . - ... the minute she finds out . - stop . - no. no. no . listen to me . listen , listen , listen. stop . - quiet . - everything you are is because of me . everything you do , everything you think ... everything is because of me . me , me , me , me , me . - i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . - can you hear me , kevin ? let 's go. we 'll take a ride . here we go. here we go . - jules . - i thought that you wanted the same thing. i was ... - jules , come on . - that was really silly . god . - i 'm in love with you . - that 's the only thing i know . that 's the only thing i know is that i am in love with you . come on . okay. okay . i love you . i love you . - what are you doing ? what the hell is going on ? - who are you ? - you made him ? do you realize what you 've done ? do you realize the consequences of what you 've done ? ! - i am the consequences ! i 'm not your proxy . i 'm his proxy . he made me . do you understand ? he was gonna hurt her , and i stopped him . why are you here ? i mean , w-why did you come back ? why now ? - because this is the day that kevin died four years ago . i thought she 'd be better off without me . i thought i 'd be better off without me . and i tried to reach out . i tried to make contact , but i couldn 't . i killed our child . i killed our child . and so , i moved away . i moved into this house ... alone . and one day , i looked in the mirror , and there was nothing there . i was gone . i was beyond repair . and that 's when the idea hit . i took a different track . i went with what i knew . i thought i could replace myself , make a better version of myself . i-i could make improvements . he could hear better . he could see better . he would be without the guilt . and he could help her . but i did it for her . i did it all for her . - get up . listen to me very carefully or you 're never gonna see her again . you understand me ? you need to leave here . take her with you , leave , and never come back ... ever . you understand ? - she 's here now ? - i 'm gonna burn this place down so no one ever knows what you did here . - but what about you ? - i 'm dying . i 'm dying , so ... so you get a second chance . so the least you can do is promise me ... she will never be alone again . you promise me this . - she won 't be alone . - now , we don 't have long before they get here . - who ? - the men from the lab ... the men from upstairs . you 're not william blakely anymore . he is. you understand ? give me your coat . - i want to go back . i want to go back to kill eagle . we can start over . - ... like , a rapid form just to get out . like , they were going that way . look. what 's this ? - i think got it . - oh , wow. that 's good . - let 's go show your dad . wow. that 's a nice one . - it 's been buried . - go show your dad . - oh , wow , what do you got ? - i first found this part of it and i kept on digging and i found the whole thing . - mm-hmm . that is amazing . yeah . a sea creature used to live in there , and the shell was its armor . yeah , this thing 's really old . it 's prehistoric . 400 million years ago , these things were ... these things were around . and , uh ... - where is it now ? - well , it died . it died , and that 's how we have the shell . but the thing with this is if you throw this back in the water , there 's a chance that somebody else will use it . - use it how ? - well , they use it . like , they 'll ... crawl inside it and make it a new home .

 This is what destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason . Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . I don 't even know what to do with myself . I 'm the last person who should be here . You 're the wrong man for the job , colonel . You don 't believe in the mission . - Neural interface ? - A repository of knowledge that can be literally downloaded into one 's mind . Do you know what a device like this did to General O 'Neill ? The sheer amount of information overwhelmed him , yes . It damn near killed him . Young is not going to listen , and Dr. Rush , well , like you said , he 's in no hurry to come home . Well , the convulsions have stopped , but he 's completely unresponsive . - You just couldn 't wait , could you ? - Anyone who had access to that room was under strict orders not to sit in that chair . You knew ! You wanted somebody there because you didn 't have the guts to do it yourself ! This is obviously someone trying to undermine the colonel 's authority . We cannot let that happen ! Somebody 's trying to frame me , Eli . - Where 's Rush ? - He didn 't make it . No headaches ? Any , uh , blurry vision ? - I 'm fine . - You sleeping okay ? T.J. , I 'm good . I gotta go . Sir ... You lost someone under your command . Most recently , three people ... Gorman , Spencer , and Rush . It happens . Well , I know how much it affects you . In different ways , I let them down . So , if you ever want to talk about it , I 'm here . - I don 't . - You should . - I 'm sorry ? - Like you said , You felt like you let Sergeant Spencer down , we all do . And there 's been a lot going on between you and Rush . What are you saying ? That emotionally , a lot has been left unresolved . Another time . Colonel ... off to file your latest report back to earth ? - That 's right . - I 'm curious about the details you intend to provide regarding the incident with Dr. Rush . Exactly what happened . I 'm scheduled to file my report with Earth later today , and it may cast some doubt on your version of events . There were only two people on that planet - me and Rush . I 'm talking about the obvious issues between the two of you . That doesn 't change anything . Listen , if you want to accuse me , you should have the guts to come right out and accuse me . I don 't have proof of anything . I think you just want to be in charge again . - I 'm saying you had plenty of motive . - Really ? Do you think that I want people on this ship suspecting me of murder ? Maybe that burden is easier to bear than actually dealing with Rush . Well , I 'll admit it , I don 't miss the man . - I say we 're all better off . - Oh , well , that 's reassuring . So if you don 't measure up , you just get left for dead ? What-what exactly is the criteria , then , for sticking around ? - Do you agree ? - All right . Let 's do this . All good ? All good . Hey , Eli . Hey , when you get a chance , can you check the shower system ? - The pressure 's been kind of low . - Sure , once I 'm done here . Dr. Caine 's pretty cute , huh ? There is nothing sexier than a widower . - Um ... - A man who 's proven that he can make a commitment and is single through no fault of his own . - I mean , what more could you ask for ? - I can hear you ! Uh , I-I ... I 'm so sorry ! How about we just , uh ... Carry on like nothing happened ? Okay . Thank you . God ... Kill me now . All right , I think we 're ready . Welcome aboard Destiny . I 'm Lieutenant Matthew Scott . - You okay ? - Excuse me ? Hi . Who are you ? Whoa , whoa ! - Sergeant , what happened ? - I have absolutely no idea , sir . Now , what do you think ? Uh ... I 'm an I.T. Tech . You know , I fix Earth computers , not ancient communication devices . Malfunction in the connection ? - That 's quite a hiccup . - I 've seen worse . We don 't exactly know what these stones do , do we ? I just got put on stone duty ' cause Riley 's not back on his feet yet . You know , Sir , you have been under quite a bit of stress . You 're not suggesting that I imagined it ? No . Whoever took over your body was acting kind of strangely ... Look , There is no way that I hallucinated that ship or that alien . My imagination isn 't that good . I was on a ship , and I saw an alien . Now , I want to know exactly what happened , what went wrong and why , and until then , the communications room and that device are off-limits , understood ? - Got a minute ? - Please , sit . You know , I always figured limited resources meant that every day would be a struggle for survival , but I never thought it would come to this . Is that supposed to be some sort of hint ? Yes , it 's a hint . If you 're wondering what to get me for Christmas , I need socks . - I heard about today 's incident . - Caine 's looking into it . You know , I find it interesting that the device just happens to malfunction moments after we had our conversation this morning . - I guess it 's kind of coincidental . - That 's one word . - Another is " convenient " . - And another is " surprising " . Okay , your turn . You actually think that this will keep me - from filing my report back to Earth ? - Actually , yeah . No , I 'm pretty sure it will . When the time comes , let 's hope that those who sit in judgment of you grant the mercy you denied Dr. Rush . I believe you mean " allegedly " denied Dr. Rush . Communications with Earth will resume as soon as I am completely satisfied that the next attempt to connect will not result in another coincidence , or convenience , or a surprise . Thank you . We have tomatoes ... - We finally have tomatoes ! - More or less . Wow , that 's odd . So I was talking to Dr. Inman , and she said the hydroponics team will have strawberries for us in about a month . Sort of strawberries . Talk to me when they can finally start growing meat . Well , actually , I heard they 're working on a soy-based protein . Happy thanksgiving , everyone . Enjoy your tofurkey . You 're in a bad mood . What 's the matter ? I haven 't slept much . Colonel Young has me working round the clock trying to figure out everything that Rush was working on ... You can 't be serious . Colonel Young was willing to sacrifice his own life so that one of us could have a shot at getting on the shuttle when the ship was heading towards that star . You think he 's a cold-blooded murderer ? - I wasn 't saying that . - It-it 's fine . Can you believe it ? Tomatoes ! Mm ! What ? And from the second we got on this ship , they 've been the ones calling all the shots . What we eat , where we sleep . What we do and when , and we just sit back and let them . Yeah , they 're the ones with the guns . Yeah , I mean , we have every right to be afraid . Look at what happened to the last person to challenge them . So , what do you think we should do ? I don 't know ... Purple plants ? Are you kidding me ? Well , purple chlorophyll is sensitive to red and infrared light . The planet 's probably orbiting a red dwarf . Well , the kino says breathable atmosphere , water , and oxygen . I 'm concerned about potential stellar flare activity - spot radiation . All right , then . We 'll suit up . Sirs ! You 've got to see this . It just showed up . - Eli ! - Bringing it up ... Now . Whoa . - What is it doing ? - Nothing , yet . It 's just sitting there . - Maybe we should try communicating with it ? - How ? Uh , well , we have broadcast capability . Of course , there 's no way in hell they 'd understand us . Eli ... But I guess there 's only one way to find out . Two alien encounters in a day . What are the chances ? I am thinking likely ... zero . Okay , sending ... Now . Let 's hope they speak ancient . There is no way this is a coincidence . I bet you I was on that ship this morning . You figure you piqued their curiosity , They came here to check on us ? I 'm thinking they 've been checking on us for a while . There 's no other way they can find us this fast . They ... Answered back . - That 's not a translation . - They answered in English ! - Now , how the hell is that possible ? - I ... - What did you say ? - " Hello . " We 're peaceful humans from planet Earth . We mean you no harm and we 'd like to meet you " . - What do I do ? What do I say back ? - Nothing . - Nothing ? - Nothing . Get our weapons on-line . This is Colonel Young . All personnel , report to designated areas . - Lieutenant , I need you and Greer in that shuttle . - Yes , sir . Something 's happening . I think they 're launching smaller ships . Oh , my god . Uh ... Only 30 % of the weapons are coming on-line . Rush put limits on how many could be activated at once . Right , right , after what happened to Riley . We were still in the process of checking each gun 's functionality . Well , find a way around it , Eli . Disengaging . Eli , come on . Hey , hey , first real space battle over here . - You got it ? - Just about . - Eli , activate the forward battery . - That 's what I 'm trying to do . - Come on , get back . Come on . - Let 's go . We 're taking heavy fire ! - Can you boost power to the shields ? - I 'm workin ' on it . Shield power is being drained by the weapons . Come on , move , go . Stay back ! We 've got surges happening all over the ship . The weapons system wasn 't ready for this . Eli , everyone onboard this ship is counting on you . - I don 't need to hear that . - You can do this . - No . No , I can 't ! - Yes , you can . Why is this all on me , okay ? What about him ? I don 't care , both of you ! I need this ship working now ! You should 've thought of that before you got rid of Rush . Just fix it . - You guys okay ? - Yeah . - Check her ! - Okay . They 're pulling back . Colonel Young , this is airman Dunning , sir . Please respond . - They 're retreating . - We got ' em on the run . Let 's give them something to remember us by . Lieutenant , I need you to end pursuit - and fall back to destiny . - But , sir ... Do not engage . I repeat , do not engage . Chloe may be on board one of those ships . What the hell happened ? Easy , Lieutenant . It was nobody 's fault . - We were not ready for this . - They gave up pretty quickly . The attack may have been a distraction to try to come in close and take prisoners , - try to gain intel . - Why are we the enemy ? I don 't know . Sir , that ship is still within shuttle range . Request permission to ... - Permission denied . - Colonel ... You wouldn 't stand a chance . - With me ! - What are we going to do ? - I 'm going after her . - How ? The communication device . Sir , you are only assuming that 's the same ship ... Guess I 'll find out when I 'm on board . Let 's elevate this . Have a seat over there , and I 'll get to you as soon as I can , okay ? Thanks so much . - Anything I can do ? - Take your pick . Grab some gauze . - Chloe was taken . - What ? How ? One of the ships latched on , cut a hole . - I can 't get a pulse over here ! - Grab the bag . Keep the pressure on him , please . - Caine ... - Yeah ? - Caine , we need you . - Okay . Okay , that 's good . Tighter . Sir ... Sir ! Let me do it . Lieutenant , it 's not going to happen . For the record , I think this is a very bad idea . Yes , but it 's the best of the bad ideas . - Go . - I think I got most of the weapons back on-line . How long is he going in for ? - 20 minutes , then we pull him out . - Okay . Colonel , you can always go back in if you don 't find her . Okay ? We are not your enemy . We mean you no harm . I don 't think it understands you . They spoke English . They sent a one-word message . For all we know , they have a translation device in their ship or something . Then they would have sent it in ancient . Why did you attack us ? Why did you take one of our people prisoner ? Why did you do that ? You want to help me ? This is how you read my mind . Do you understand ? This one transmits . This one receives . Like this . Here , like this . Yeah ! Yeah ... Do not engage . Chloe may be aboard one of those ships . Colonel Young ! - What happened ? - He 's back . What just happened ? The alien ship is closing in on us . Send me back . Send me back now ! - Okay , good to go . - Ready ! It 's not working . Why isn 't it working ? Untie me . There doesn 't seem to be anything wrong with the device . Did you find Chloe ? Uh , guys ? You may have noticed they 're attacking us again . Eli ... Our shields aren 't going to hold for much longer . Bring the main weapon on-line . Fire on the big ship . - Chloe is still on board that ship ! - Do it now , Eli ! Return fire ! Everything we 've got ! We can 't keep this up . The whole weapons system is overloading . - Shields are down almost 50 - I know ! - Where are you going ? - To try and save Chloe . It 's okay , it 's okay . It 's okay ... We have to go . Here . Oh , god ... Where are we going ? This way . - Report ! - Bad and more bad . Too much power is going to the weapons . Shields are going to fail . Bolster the shield . Devote all remaining weapons power to the main weapon . Keep firing on the big ship . Not like you , taking the shuttle without asking . He 'll say no , and I don 't want to disobey an order . - You got a problem with that ? - You want to save her ? - Do it . - I 'm going . You don 't have to . I 'm already here . - Keep firing . - We fire again , - and we risk blowing ourselves up . - I don 't have a choice . Do it . They 're ... They 're retreating . All of them except that one . Wait . They 're gone . Matt ! - Colonel Young said you were dead . - Oh , did he ? - Did he say how it happened ? - Rock slide . Well , obviously , he was wrong again . Colonel Young , this is Greer . Come in . Go ahead . You are not going to believe this . I managed to , um , activate the systems on the crashed ship . Found a database . I 'd only just begun to look through it when aliens showed up . I guess I must have accidentally activated some kind of distress beacon . Anyway , I 'm glad I did . I would have died out there . Oh , well , there are a few people who thought Colonel Young left you to die on purpose . I imagine there were . No , no , he would have rightly assumed That I was ... I was gone , in the rock slide . So , what happened when the aliens brought you on their ship ? To be honest ? I don 't remember that much . The few times I was conscious , they were ... probing my mind . That 's something I 'd rather not think about , really . I know they were frustrated . I seemed to be able to resist giving them the information they wanted . He used their own neural interface against them , getting what he needed so we could escape . Location of the fighter bay , basic operating systems . Anything else ? Like why they wanted to destroy us ? I don 't think they did want to destroy us . What they really want is Destiny ! Probably only care about us because we recently came aboard . No , what they want is a way past her defenses , try and find out what secrets she might hold . Unfortunately , I didn 't have time to find out any more . My first priority was getting Chloe and I off the ship . Well , it 's good to have you back . Both of you . - So ... - So . I suppose you 're wondering ... why I didn 't tell everyone the truth . - It 's your word against mine . - I didn 't tell anyone you tried to frame me for Spencer 's death . Well , that 's true . No , I just wanted to know whether I can assume that you are going to try and kill me again next chance you get . I saved you from those aliens . You fired on the alien ship while I was still aboard . Well , so was Chloe . That was a command decision , protecting the greater good . Yes , indeed . Look ... I realize ... That I did provoke you . Well , if it means anything , I , uh ... regret leaving you on that planet . Don 't get me wrong . I think you deserved it , but I regret that I lost control , That I became a man that I couldn 't respect anymore . Well , you 're here , I 'm here - we just have to live with it , don 't we ? Well , so does everyone else on board . They don 't need the distraction . They don 't need to doubt their leadership , and this ship needs to be ready for the next encounter . If we haven 't found our way home by then . Of course . So , what ? We just pretend nothing happened ? Well , it 's not like we were ever friends . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . - Hey there . - Hi ! - Do you mind ? - No , it 's okay . - You want to try some ? - What is it ? A little something that Dr. Inman 's been working on . She claims it tastes like gin . I say it 's a little closer to rubbing alcohol . Solid sales pitch . Um , no , thank you . All right . So , uh ... What do you think ? You and James , any chance there ? It could just get really awkward . You know , if things didn 't work out . I mean , being stuck on this ship with someone you 've had a bad relationship with ? No thanks . It 's probably best to just keep things ... professional , for as long as we can , anyways . I mean , we 'll see . If we 're here much longer , I hereby reserve the right to completely change my mind . The colonel 's dangerous . We need to do something about that . - I tried . - I know . Damn near killed me for it . Next time will be different .

 My name is Stephen Jameson . I 'm one of the Tomorrow People . They call our powers the three T 's . - Telepathy ... - Stephen ? Telekinesis ... And teleportation . There is a shadow war going on between us and Ultra ... - No ! - the secret organization that hunts us . The only way to keep my scies from going extinct is to find my father . And the only way to do that is by working for the enemy . Previously on The Tomorrow People ... Your new friends want you to believe that your father is still alive . They lied to you . - Dad ? - Son . You need to go back . Why don 't you come back with me ? I can 't . Not until you find my body . What is all this stuff ? Remnants of your father 's various experiments . What is this ? Your father never told me . But it does rather seem to like you , doesn 't it ? Who are you ? Don 't hurt me . I 'll give you anything you want . Wait a second . I can explain . Oh , my god . That was ... Long overdue . What ? Nothing . I 'm just not sure about this whole sleeping together and working together . I respect your authority . In and out of the bedroom . It looks like someone just had a horizontal jaunting match . Can it , Russ . What 's up ? We got Tim to analyze the device you had in my dad 's box of old stuff . It appears to be a key of some sort . Part of a larger device . But the code is unlike anything I 've ever encountered . As opposed to the standard binary operation ... English , Tim . The component is biological in nature . It 's bound to Stephen 's father . Okay . But what does it do ? We think it 's looking for Roger . Phoning home . Which means my dad 's body might still be out there . Like physically out there . So you think Jedikiah was lying and that your dad wasn 't cremated . All we have to do is get inside his mind and find out where . We tried that already . Almost got us all killed . It 's not worth the risk . We 're talking about my father . Technically , if we could get his guard down ... I 'm sorry , Stephen . You want to chance your life on a theory , you 're going to have to do it on your own . I 've got a better idea . - This next one 's for all the ladies in the house . - No . No , no , no . Whatever you think you 're gonna ... Don 't ! Just , whatever . Who cares ? Do it . Uh , talk it over ! Totally fighting over me . But tonight 's not about me , amigo . Tonight is about you . How you need some rebound frivolity . I 'm sorry Russell . I 'm less interested in talking up girls , more interested in finding my dad 's body . Ew ! That sounded super weird . Hey , it 's two in the morning . Nothing to do right now but get weird . That was my partner from Ultra . Great . Invite her out . That girl needs to get laid even more than you do . I can 't . We got a new case . There 's a breakout who think she 's a superhero . She 's using her powers to save humans and she leaves a rose . What ? I don 't know , it 's her mark . You know , Zorro has a Z , she has a flower . That 's a lot of money for the odds , kid . Spare me the editorial and spin . I 'm feeling lucky tonight . Hey ! Hey , wait a minute ! Should have listened to the dealer . Looks like you were getting a little too hot for your own good . What do you mean ? Win that spin and those goons would have taken you downstairs to beat the crap out of you . So , I cooled you off . You 're welcome . Russell , hey ! You got to sober up , buddy . So what 's the deal ? Ultra 's going to take her powers ? No . They 're gonna kill her . Hey . I got your message . And I thought we were looking for a chick . A chick ? Pull yourself together , you smell like a frat house . What are you talking about ? I was at home , studying . Your bluff sucks . God knows how you convinced the bouncer that you were 21 . Meet Avery Fletcher . Conspiracy theorist . With a blog called the Fletcher files . In addition to nanorobots in our water supply , he has a few theories about our superhero . Don 't you pal ? Been tracking her for years . She has a name . Red Avenger . Where am I ? Is this like a secret CIA within the CIA ? Tell us where we can find her . Or I will cut off your ... What , you have a tick ? Don 't get too comfortable . Sorry about that , my partner is a little unhinged . Full disclosure . She scares the crap out of me . Now , you got to give me something about this Red Avenger . Right , anything . Just to get her off both of our backs . I ... I don 't know . Come on , like where is she from ? No idea . Well what 's the deal with the rose ? It 's an American beauty hybrid red in 14 or 16 . Look I don 't have anything to do with those envelopes of white powder that got sent to the governor . That was just baking soda , I swear . Okay , okay . Yeah . What are you going to tell your partner ? Um , that you are just some harmless wacko . Oh , my god . Thank you so much . Sorry to sneak up on you . No problem . Just blowing off a little steam . I was only gone a few weeks , but ... sometimes it feels like the whole world has changed . Yeah , you 're telling me . Look , John . I wanted to talk to you about your problems trying to get inside Jedikiah 's head . You were eavesdropping . It 'll never work . Stephen won 't get what he needs . Jedikiah 's too cautious . But maybe I can find out where he 's hiding Roger 's body . - How ? - He trusts me . I 'll go to him . And when he 's least expecting it ... Are you sure this isn 't just about you missing your boyfriend ? Yeah . I 'll have to talk to Cara . She and I have never seen eye to eye , but you know Jedikiah . You know there 's more to him than ... You 're not a prisoner down here . You 're here for your own safety . I go topside without permission , Cara 's never going to let me come back . I need you to cover for me while I 'm gone . You get caught snooping around in Jedikiah 's brain , you 're definitely not coming back . I hate it when someone steals the toy without eating any cereal . Remember that superhero I told you about ? Turns out you know her . Knew her . We met in Vegas four years ago . The girl was a total player . Schooled me sideways . So , naturally , I had to partner up . Had a good run , too . Took casinos from Macau to Montreal for more money than we could spend . Then you fell for her . Russell does not fall . I 'm sorry to report Russell , but my search for recent records on Talia has proven fruitless . Look , Talia and I , we have unfinished business . I can 't let Ultra get her . Okay , we don 't have a ton of leads yet . But this rose she leaves , it 's a pretty rare hybrid . Red 14 or something . It must be red 16 . That was her roulette play . That particular varietal may be found locally at the Rockefeller rose garden in the Bronx . Pull up surveillance of the gardens , see if we can find our girl . I can 't believe she actually went through with it . More fun being partners than competitors , isn 't it ? I 'm calling room service . Who is in the mood for a little champagne tub ? Sounds good . But I was thinking ... what if we ... changed up our hustle a little bit . You know what would be a real rush . Helping people . We are people . We are helping us . Russell I 'm serious , we have superpowers . Have you ever thought that our destiny might be to give something back ? With all the money that we 've made we could 've fed a village , funded a school . Think of all the bad people out there . Wait . You want to be a superhero ? Okay ... You can be the Scarlett Pimpernel . And I can be ... The Scarlett Pimp . Well , then ... Come here , pimp . Um , excuse me . Sorry to disturb you . Will you wake up already ? I 'm not a bloody alarm clock . What is it , Tim ? Your so-called red avenger just snuck into Rockefeller gardens to pilfer a few roses . Is she still there ? Unfortunately , no . But I was able to follow her to a bar in little Saigon . You been here before ? Two thousand miles between Korea and Vietnam . I just mean you look like you know your way around . You getting any paranormal vibes ? She 's under us . We 're not here to fight you . Hey ! Hey ! It 's me ! It 's me ! Talia ! Seriously . What 's wrong with you ? It 's me . You 're not Talia . Duh . The name 's Mallory . Who are you clowns anyway ? And how do you know Talia ? You 're Russell Kwon ? Uh ... That 's what it says on my underwear . Feel like I should ask for an autograph or something . I thought you two didn 't know each other . Well I know of him . We all know of him . He inspired the first in our line of avengers . Although in my mind you were taller . Wait , so there 's more than one Red Avenger person ? And you started this ? I have no idea what she 's talking about . Where 's Talia ? Don 't you get it ? She 's everywhere . The avenger 's a mantle . It 's passed down from person to person , from city to city . Talia 's still out there . Doing what you taught her to do . And what she taught me , and some day if I 'm lucky , I 'll pass it on to somebody else . As much as I love to take credit for other people 's work ... You 're humble . I like that . It 's really classy , man . Look ... I respect you playing dress-up and beating on baddies , but you have no idea what we 're up against in this town . We 're being hunted by a secret government organization called Ultra . We have this bunker where people like us are safe . You 're welcome to join us , Mallory . Oh , that 's cute . All right , you guys can crawl back down into your bunker , but I don 't play in a world of safe . Neither does Talia . Well , good talk , but I gotta go finish that mission that y 'all pooched . What mission ? If you 're so curious , why don 't you join me for a ride along ? Uh , you want us to play superhero ? It 's not a game . You came . Yeah , I did . Against my better judgment . What are you doing above ground , Morgan ? Well I needed a proper bath . You wouldn 't believe the locker room they have me sharing at the lair . My employer thinks I murdered you . And if he senses any new traces of ... Sweetheart . You 're always keeping your guard up . Careful not to betray a single thought . Or emotion . Didn 't you miss me ? Ugh . You live here ? No sense in putting down roots . As soon as the work is done I 'm gone . So what exactly is the red avenger working on these days ? Those guys I was trying to grab at the club , They weren 't purse snatchers . They 're muscle for a vietnamese gang . What is all this ? A plot to disrupt the prosecution of their money laundering operation . I 've been following it for a few months now . Jury intimidation , witness tampering , These guys will stop at nothing . Not even targeting a federal judge and his family . Which is why I 've been staking out their house . But first , I 'm going to need to find you guys some tights . You want to be superheroes , you gotta dress the part . Tights ? I 'm screwing with you . Here . You can carry my calling card . what 's that ? Judge 's home security system . While we were eating dumplings , the gang must have made their move . We gotta go . The cops gotta be on their way , right ? They 're only hope is us . Please . I 'm begging you . Don 't hurt my family . I 'll do whatever you want . I 'm sorry to tell you this . But your daddy drew the wrong case . Nifty trick , huh ? Now 's the fun part . What 's up ? It 's Stephen . He 's using his powers above ground . - Is he in trouble ? - No , it 's weird . It feels like he 's having fun . What 's happening ? It 's okay . You 're safe . Your family 's safe . The cops should be here any minute . How can I ever thank you ? You just did . Hey guys . Good news . We found a breakout . What the hell do you guys think you 're doing ? We just saved these people . Check it , goons , toast . You 're not even supposed to be here . Just felt a teleport . It 's Ultra . Guys we need to go now . We must have just missed her . Yeah . I guess so . You used your powers in front of a federal judge . He was blindfolded . We 're trying to save our species and you 're risking it all . What do you think they 'd do if they knew our kind had powers ? Seems like it worked out pretty well for superman . Spiderman . Batman , kind of . The list goes on and on . Could you give us a minute please ? Sure , sorry . Didn 't realize I was interrupting the secret council . Look , maybe it 's time to reconsider our position . Do some good . We 've been playing an awful lot of defense lately . Since when are you a philanthropist ? Maybe I 'm evolving . Maybe I don 't want to see a teenage girl get raped by a bunch of gangsters . We got enough problems , russell . Like finding our ghost hero who 's lost in Limbo land ? No offense , dude . Sorry I got you in trouble with the rents . It 's all good . Good . ' Cause I 'm not really that sorry . I mean seriously , who died and left them in charge anyway ? Stephen 's dad , actually . - Oh . - It 's a long story . Well , I got some time . This is out of control . You 're the only one I can trust . What ? I know I should have told you sooner , but I took Morgan topside to try to extract intel from Jedikiah . Was it before or after you took me topside to have sex ? That is not fair . I 'm sorry , but we are not holding her against her will . Is that right ? You got this all figured out ? Did Morgan tell you she 's pregnant ? I didn 't think so . Sorry I missed the big sting . I heard the Red Avenger person got away . I 'd rather you say nothing then lie to me . Easy . What are you talking about ? I found something that belongs to you . Where was this ? The judge 's house . Just as our breakout was making a clean getaway . Yeah okay , I was there , too . I was trying to apprehend the breakout . Spare me ! She saved an entire family . A judge , his wife , his daughter who couldn 't have been older than 15 . If we can 't get behind a superhero then what the hell are we doing ? You do have a heart . You don 't know a thing about me . Try me . Growing up , my family and I were pretty close . One night when I was 10 , there was a loud banging at the door . And three men , ex-cons , broke in trying to steal anything they could trade for a fix . My mother did everything that they asked . But my brother was always trying to be a hero . And they caught him . Calling the cops . So they , um ... They shot ' em all . and I just laid there frozen under the bed , wishing that I had the power to save them . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , I didn 't ... I had no idea . After I broke out , I made a promise to myself . That I would do everything in my power to protect people . That 's why I work at Ultra . That is why I am such a hard-ass . Don 't you ever leave me hanging again . So John killed Stephen 's dad . Then you almost killed Stephen to prove that in fact his father is not dead . And now you want to find his body so he can lead you all to a promised land . See this is why I prefer to be a lone wolf . Far less drama . Although , I do have to say , it 's been kind of nice having a partner . Me ? Isn 't the mission over ? I mean , we saved the judg , right ? No . Look , until Om Lam Chung 's behind bars , trust me , this thing ain 't over . - Who 's ... - Om lam chung , leader of the made to kill Vietnamese American crime syndicate , currently awaiting trial under the RICO Act . Bingo . What the snooty , disembodied voice thing said . Perhaps I should turn myself off if my intelligence isn 't welcome . So sensitive . Look Chung 's gang is going to do anything they can to evade a conviction . The trial 's set to start on Friday . That 's what you think . What , what do you mean , Tim ? Tim , I know you 're not sleeping . I can see your little light pulsing . I just thought you should know that his trial was just pulled up 48 hours according to just-filed courtroom documents . The trial 's tomorrow ? We gotta go . Come on . We gotta prep . Are you coming ? I ... I don 't know . We weren 't given these powers so we could hide in a tunnel . We were born great so that we may do great things . That 's what Talia said . Or maybe she was just wrong about you . Talia ? Talia ? Yeah , security . I need to report a theft from my room . No , I know who did it . Her name 's Talia . Where are you going ? I am done taking orders and being a prisoner to a hypothetical cause when I could be out there helping real people . Right now . Ultra is hardly hypothetical . We act like we have to choose between working for them or fighting them . That 's a fake choice . There are dragons to slay . We were given swords . I say we choose greatness . Who 's with me ? Whatever . Destiny doesn 't ask twice . You ever think about the future ? That 's all I think about . I mean , our future . What it would be like if it could just be you and me . No Ultra , no shadow war , just ... a normal couple living a normal happy life . Why do you torture yourself ? They 're called dreams , Jedikiah . What if we could have a child ? How would we raise it ? Human ? Paranormal ? This war is no place to raise a child , especially not one of our making , okay ? Go to sleep . Okay . I 'm sorry . Sorry . - What were you doing ? - Nothing . No , that didn 't feel like nothing , Morgan . What were you doing ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You know what I think ? I think you drew me here for a reason and it wasn 't for a roll in the hay , Morgan . No , I missed you . That 's all . You were trying to read my mind right now . What were you looking for ? I 'm not looking for ... Don 't you lie to me . What were you looking for ? Jed . Please ... Don 't lie to me ! Let her go . That 's convenient , John . I was waiting outside the door long enough to hear you almost kill the woman you love . And your unborn child . He 's lying . Tell me he 's lying . Congratulations , Jed . You 're going to be a father . After weeks of anticipation , the time has come for reputed mob leader Om Lam Chung to stand trial for his litany of crimes , including money laundering , racketeering , extortion , even murder . Good . We have your attention . Now we have some demands . The gunmen are requesting a helicopter . They say they 'll kill hostage every hour if their demands aren 't met . It 's cool , it 's just me . - I don 't have time for talk . - I 'm here to help . Guess you better suit up then . I was hoping I 'd have company . I just got a spike at the federal courthouse . Hostage situation . It 's a chance to get our girl . Wait , you 're going to stop her from saving those people ? I 'm going to stop her from exposing our kind . She and her partner . - Partner ? - Two signatures on sight . Looks like she picked up a sidekick . Okay . What about what you said before . About her doing what we should be doing . Maybe someday , but today I still take orders from Ultra . Guys we got trouble . Stephen . What 's wrong ? Ultra 's got a bead on Mallory but she 's not alone , Russell 's with her at the federal courthouse . What are they doing at the courthouse ? Perhaps it has something to do with the 36 hostages being held at gunpoint . Ultra is going to sweep him up along with Mallory . - I have an idea . - At your service . Get down ! Hurry up ! Now the fun part . Justice is served . Russell . Time to go . Russell . Never heard of him . You must mean the Scarlett Pimp ! How do you like that ? Now . We gotta go . There she is . Okay . Flank around the outside . I got her . She 's good . We got a read on multiple teleports from outside the courtroom . Or she 's a decoy . Russell get out okay ? Yeah , your plan worked . Hey . Keep it . It 's kinda hot . Look at all those lights . So many people to save . It 's been cool working with you . It was fun while it lasted . Wait . You 're leaving ? What about all those people ? I told you I was passing the mantle on and I am . To you . Be great , Russell . Always wondered what happened to you . Talia . Thought you 'd be happy to see me . I am , but ... I have to tell you something . You 're the one who turned me in . I thought you ripped me off . Anonymous donation to the Las Vegas Youth Center . I 'm such a douche . Yeah , you were . Then why did you tell your disciples that I 'm some hero ? Because I hoped one day you would be . Today , you proved me right . I only bet on sure things , Russell . You should know that about me by now . Take me with you . I 'm ready to be a hero full-time . We can partner up like we always planned . No . Look , you 've got your partners . It 's up to you to find your next mission . Goodbye , Russell . I got to get a calling card . Thank you guys for helping out back there . We saved a lot of people , including a superhero . So why aren 't we celebrating ? Morgan tried to read your uncle 's mind . And got caught . - What did you see ? - Nothing useful . Just a bunch of random memories . There was your uncle walking into a deli . Maybe where he met your father to eat . You mean a butcher shop ? Uh , maybe . Why ? It 's an Ultra front . I went there with jedikiah once . - Where is it ? - I don 't know , I was twelve . If you were there , even if you don 't remember the details , it 's still somewhere in your mind . You could let me have a look . This only works if you let me in . I know how this works . Broadway and Bedford . Brooklyn . Are you all right ? No more secrets . Hillary , um ... Relax . Your mom didn 't see me . Look , now is not really a good time . Sit down . Okay . Working with you has made me soft . All those things I told you . I 'm not used to being this vulnerable . What are you talking about ? I mean how else could I have missed the obvious ? You didn 't want to catch the breakout . You were doing everything in your power to subvert the operation . If you have all these doubts about me , why don 't you write up a report ? What 's stopping you from going to Jedikiah ? This is very unprofessional , Jameson . This type of behavior will not be tolerated . Debrief at HQ in 90 minutes . Then maybe after that we can have a little debrief on the debrief . I 'm going to debrief you so hard . I loved him , too , you know . Here 's what I figure happened . Morgan ransacked my brain , shared her discoveries with the tomorrow people and now here you are . A straight line of deceit . You said you cremated him . Yes , well it looks like we both have some explaining to do .

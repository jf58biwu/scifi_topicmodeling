Some media darling with a five-second kill reel breezes into school on a golden ticket . Buckle up , kid . Cuz this ticket puts you on a plane straight to hell . And the in-flight movie ? Super hell . Understood , sir . I know it will be rough here , but ... I did get some practice at the Milwaukee Invitational , so ... Oh , really ? Still feeling cocky , Mr. Milwaukee ? You 're the lowest-ranked player in the school ! Well I should probably go get some practice then ... And as for you , Ki Swan . I don 't care what game your parents developed . What the frag are you doing ? Well sir , you cut such an imposing figure I thought I 'd make a game about you . Haha , awesome ! What are my moves ? Calhoun always wins . Acceptable .

The name 's Games ... Games Dean . So cool . Brian , your secret weapon seems to have misfired . Hey ! Come on , we doin ' this or what , D. ? Oh ! No , I 'm not here to fight . You 're our welcome buddy . What ? She 's supposed to show us around and ... stuff . Alright , sorry guys . Duty calls . Let 's go . And this concludes your tour of VGHS . You took us in a straight line and said nothing . Hey , Jenny doesn 't have time to show us noobs around . She 's got the whole JV team to worry about . Speaking of which ... Give me five reasons I should put you on my team . That was pretty transparent , wasn 't it ... ? Yeah , a bit . Reason number one , I 'm honest to a fault ! You probably shouldn 't list one of your faults as a reason . It 's okay , Ki , she 's gone . Wait , that 's not okay , I don 't know where my room is ! Seriously , guys , fun 's over , right ? What 's wrong , baby Wong ? Thought you rockstars knew how to party . Yeah , totally , Annihilist ! Totally , yeah ! Okay , you guys got me . Oh , hey ! Ted Wong . Ki Swan . 1360 points . Fighter .

This loser is the R.A. Are you really his girlfriend ? Because- - Nice . What do we got here ? Hey , give that back ! What 's this ? I don 't know . Something stupid . Chiba ? Hanzo ? Where 'd you get this , the poor store ? Where 'd you get your manners ? The ... rude store ? Oh my goodness ! Aw , sweet burn dude ! Nobody ... insults my manners . Well nobody makes fun of my gear . And no one insults my new best friend . This sounds like a challenge . Woah , woah ... you guys can 't fight in my hallway . Rumble in the Rumpus Room ! Ladies and gentlemen ! I present to you a match-up of epic proportions . In the cool corner we got , Brian D. ! And in the other corner we have some loser that was hardcore guffin ' me . Alright , y 'all know the rules ! Single life , no respawns . Player one , are you ready ? Let 's do it ! New best friend , are you ready ? Brian , I just looked at the official rulebook . I really think that you should look at paragraphs 12 through 90 . Any chance you could paraphrase ? Oh okay , um . Read rules . Important . That 's not what I meant , Ki ! Alright , let 's get it on ! You can 't hide from me ! You 're like a minnow , and I 'm a shark , I 'm gonna eat ' cha . Great timing , Chiba . Yes ! Yes ! Ha ha ! Who 's working at the poor store now ? Wait , what just happened ? Oh , Brian . Paragraph 90 , Section 3 . Should a student 's rank fall below zero , then they are automatically , ruthlessly and instantly- - Expelled . Annihilist , dude , I didn 't know ... Four more reasons , Brian . Welcome to VGHS . Jenny , wait ! Where 's my room ? ! On the plus side , dude ... That guy was supposed to be your roommate . Dude , I just got a kid expelled . How is that a plus side ? YEAH ! Best roommate friends forever ! I 'm okay . The one-shot wonder . We meet at last . Hey ! Uh , the , uh ... the Law ... It 's just Law around here , Brian . I don 't mean to pry , Bri-guy , but , uh ... Are you okay ? What 're doing here ? Just gettin some air ... You were gonna throw your gear out , weren 't you . I dunno . VGHS is a little bit different than I thought . Chiba and Hanzo just kinda feel out of place . Brian ... Look , who are we talkin about here . Your gear ? Or you . I know , right ? Stupid . Listen . Oh . Old school . Nice . Let me tell you something I 've always kind of told myself . Fitting in at VGHS is hard , but ... You can 't be the best , unless you be yourself . Okay ? Never ... never forget that . Never let anyone break you . Do you really mean that ? More than anything in the world . Chiba ! Too bad you 're in my world now , Brian . Don 't you get it , Brian ! ? I am VGHS ! Welcome ... to me !

 [ GROWLING ] So let me get this straight . You just woke up and your symptoms had regressed ? Not regressed , vanished . No lesions , no fever , no black mucus . That 's ... God , this is good . Unbelievable . Like I was never infected in the first place . Hate to say it , but the virus could be entering a latent stage , going dormant . Lysogenesis . At first I thought that too , but I feel so good . Are you gonna eat that ? Please , help yourself . [ CHUCKLES ] Sure hasn 't hurt your appetite at all . So you 're not feeling any other symptoms ?

Okay , okay . As soon as I finish this , I 'm gonna get back to the lab , run a full panel of myself , CBC , coags , viral screen , the works . If I developed antibodies that fight off the virus , it 'd help others . I don 't want you near the lab until we confirm every trace of this virus is out of your body . Remember Bucharest , 2002 . What happened in Bucharest ? Meningitis outbreak . The aid workers were hoarding a vaccine . Crowd stormed the center , nearly killed them . If anyone gets wind of your recovery , they may think we 've come up with a cure . I want you to keep a low profile , especially with Sutton roaming the halls . Sutton ? Hatake warned me about her . He doesn 't trust her either . He said that ? When ? When we were down on Level R. He was down there ? With you ? He helped me get back up here . I thought you knew .

There 's bleach , disinfecting supplies in the airlock . I want you to spray down this entire room after you 've taken everything out in biohazard containers , destroyed it . I don 't want anyone consuming contaminated foodstuffs in a panic . Let 's lock down this sector while we sterilize . Anyone asks , it 's routine maintenance . MAN : Yes , sir .

I may have failed to provide them with the optimal conditions for success . What would you like me to have the men do ? Have them do nothing . Allow the vectors to run free . We 'll see if fear inspires creativity . Anything else ? I 'm good at my job , aren 't I ? Unquestionably . Usually I can assess any situation , immediately determine what is important and what is not . I ascribe value , Klein . So why can I not find the value in this Julia Walker ? Speak freely . Can 't be you . Must be the situation . Thank you . And , Klein ... AUTOMATED VOICE [ OVER PA ] : Code 127 double G ... This is ridiculous . Why am I dressed up for nerd prom ? You 're trying to blend in . I need Sutton to see me doing her work so we can continue to move around the base freely . What are you looking at ? Stop that . What ? Being yourself . I missed you too , Miksa . My name 's Daniel . Okay , Daniel . So how is it you never realized your playmates kept disappearing from this place ? Hatake lied to me . Why wouldn 't I believe the man who adopted me ? If you don 't know , talk to someone who does . Hatake 's not gonna tell you anything . I 'm not talking about Hatake . [ DOOR OPENS ] What did you do ? You have to be more specific . What did you do to Julia down on Level R ? Do you have a cure ? There is no cure . What happened to Dr. Walker was not my doing . I don 't believe you . It doesn 't matter what you believe . Dr. Walker is virus-free , and that puts her in grave danger . From whom ? Sutton ? From Sutton , from everyone . And not just at this base . If she is the only person in the world to have beaten the virus ... Then she 'll be experimented on for the rest of her life . Go . Now . Don 't leave her side .

One option , I will allow you to return to the lab and continue working even though I 've gotten closer to the cure in eight minutes than you have in the last eight days . As for Dr. Walker , her body contains a proprietary medical therapy belonging to ilaria . You can 't just appropriate a human being . Oh , but I can . She 's mine now .

You bring him along to finish the job ? Hey , this wasn 't my idea . I see that . You don 't have your trusty ice ax . Stop it , both of you . Kill each other later . There 's other lives at stake here . Hatake has to have a list of those kids he stole . And we need your help to get it . What you need is to take your brother and get as far away from this place as you can . DANIEL : He 's right , we 're wasting time . Miksa . Stop calling me that . This ends one way for anyone who stays , understand ? I thought you 'd give up the act and try giving a shit . Goddamn it . Don 't be naive . I 'm not who you think I am .

I mean no immune response , no antibodies , no traces of residual genetic material , no viral DNA . As far as I can tell , she 's in perfect health . You 'll have to run those tests again . You mean for a third time ? What you 're saying isn 't possible . Right , because nothing else around here strains credulity . I 'm gonna get Jules back . Okay . What can I do ?

After all these years , everything that we 've been through to achieve our goal , and you jeopardize all of it for your own selfish cause . You 've sacrificed everything . For what ? Ilaria ? I helped build ilaria . They deserve my loyalty . Unfortunately , that doesn 't seem to be your strong suit . I have no problem with loyalty . Genocide , on the other hand ... [ EARPHONE BEEPS ] Sutton . KLEIN : Dr. Walkerk escaped . We 're searching the area . Where is she ? She may have gotten into the ducts . Then go ' mm me duds and find her .

But you do care for her . That much is obvious . What do you see that I 'm not seeing , Hiroshi ?

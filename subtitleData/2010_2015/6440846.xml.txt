 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... That 's an artifact from Warehouse 12 . Something about mind control ... I thought there was just one of those . Very good , gentlemen . What is Benedict Valda doing here ? He died in Egypt in a pit of fire . He 's replicating artifacts . Eleven ? There should be twelve . This portal opens to the regent sanctum in China . We both know it wouldn 't have worked . Why do you say that ? Because you 're in love with Myka . What happened to Claire ? Your sister was infected by the music box . The only solution was Oliver Sacks ' record player that keeps her in a perpetual coma . - What happened ? Where 's Claire ? - She 's gone . Did I do this ? I tried to cure Claire . Did I somehow make her worse ? - If I did , I swear to God ... - No ! - This is not your fault . - But what if it is ? What if I woke something up inside her , something more dangerous than what was already there ? Trust me , we 're going to find her , but , Claudia , I need you present , I need you focused . - Claire needs you . - Okay , all right . Well , she couldn 't have woken up by herself . Not with Sacks ' record player keeping her in a coma . Which by the way , is also gone . Nice security in this place . Well , you might 've noticed that when you broke in . Obviously , somebody hacked into their video surveillance system . Probably the same way that you did , when you broke in . Well , then somebody should run a diagnostic of their entire security system , shouldn 't they ? Hmm . Without Sacks ' record player keeping her in check , Claire would 've trashed this place , right ? Yeah , whoever did this knew that they had to keep her attached to the record player . But who even knew she was here ? Much less wanted to break her out . Well , let 's have a look , shall we ? Good . Spectrometer occurrence is five hours . So , if Claire were still here , we can ... We can fast forward . Good . I wanna see the son of a bitch . I 'm gonna put him in the ground for this . There ! Who 's that ? - That 's impossible ! It 's ... - Benedict Valda . Time to rise and shine . Who are you ? - What is this thing ? - That won 't come off . It allows me to control your prodigious powers , miss Donovan . You 'll do exactly what I say . Like hell I will . - No ! Ah ! - Calm down . Calm down . Down . Get up . Come . No . Oh ! Good . You will do as I say . Yes . You and I are going to do great things , miss Donovan . So , Valda is alive . He 's alive . How come Valda didn 't die in Warehouse 2 ? So , why wait three years to show up ? This is not the Valda that we knew . If my theory is correct , - then this is the Valda ... - From the alternate time continuum . Great . The Nazi Valda . Fun ! Pete , put it back ! What ? I never knew it did that . Cool . - Stop touching things . - Right . Okay . So , how did that Valda get into our time continuum ? Recede forks . I suspect he took one out of my bag while I was his prisoner and he used it to prevent himself from becoming erased . So now that he 's here , what 's he gonna do ? Well , this new Valda , he 's from a militaristic world , where ruthless experimentation in the name of scientific progress , - that was a norm . - And he 's got my sister . I just got her back . I 'm not about to lose her to some psycho from another dimension . When I get my hands on him , I 'm gonna snap off ... Use that energy to figure out why he took her . Fine . But , I 'm doing it angrily . - Like that . - Oh , my God . Guess who 's been hiding out at his room in the dead agent 's vault ? Weasel covered his tracks , until now . He 's been in the Warehouse the whole time . That 's how he knew about Claire . - Pete , come on . - Huh ? Uh , you and me ? Alone ? Bring your favorite Teddy bear and a night light . Come on . Jinksy , you up for a little snoop and poop ? Huh ? Uh , six eyes are better than four . Aren 't they , Artie ? Artie . - Artie ? - Do whatever the hell ... No , I 'm okay . I 'm just gonna stay here and help these guys out . No , come on . I 'll take off my shirt . Been working on my guns . How about working on your breath ? As if Valda squatting in the Warehouse wasn 't creepy enough , now we got to rummage through his stuff ? Clearly , he 's been busy in here . Yeah , but doing what ? And what does it have to do with Claire ? Well , maybe these artifacts will tell us . We just have to figure out what they do . Yeah , I 'll grab a laptop so we can check the database . I can do it . - No , it 's okay , I got it . - No , no , no . Really , really ? ' Cause I ... - I don 't mind . - Yeah , thanks , though . So , here we are , just us . - Hi . Huh ? - What are you doing ? - Get back to work . - What ? Yes . All right . Look , I 'm taking inventory of Valda 's personal effects , all right ? You should be ... I don 't know , look through the files or something . Sounds like a date . A plan . It sounds like a plan . Because a date , that would mean ... That would mean ... You have got to stop eating sugar . How ? How can you be ? No ! - Hey , Mykes . - Yeah . Valda seems pretty interested in Claire 's freaky psychokinetic powers . Uh , the alternate Valda he got his jollies out of copying artifacts , right ? Right . He replicated the Spine of the Saracen . Exactly . He made a bunch of zombie warriors . Now what if he was going to do the same thing with Claire ? Right . What if he was gonna use her to create an army of telekinetic rage monsters to conquer the world ? Probably not . Yeah , but then , why does he have all her medical records ? I don 't know . But there 's one item missing from his personal effects . - It 's a safe deposit key . - So ? To a box in the Regent 's Vault . What artifact does Valda want from here ? I have no idea . Let 's hope he hasn 't got his hands on it yet . I 'm guessing Keeler not answering his phone is a bad sign . Oh , no . Keeler ! But there 's something ... What ? Get out ! It 's a trap ! Careful , careful ... - Artie ? - Artie ? - Oh , my God ! - Looks like an " Artiesicle " . Okay . Mykes , we 're going to have to neutralize the statue . Yeah . Do it . Okay . How are we gonna get through the ice ? This inukshuk probably belonged to Sir William Perry . - Gonna need more than that . - Well , basically it means that Artie has been cryogenically frozen . And that means what ? Well , we have about an hour to thaw him out before he freezes to death . Right . There it is . I knew there was some bad news in there somewhere . Okay , so what if we try to internally elevate his body temperature ? Wait a minute , Mykes . You remember those , uh , the glasses that Artie used to warm up the guy that got zombified by the Donner Party Jar ? Yes ! Alfred Butz , the inventor of the thermostat . - Let 's call Steve . - Whoo ! Let 's call him . - Let 's call him out there . - Okay . Okay , I 'll take the glasses to Pete and Myka . - Are you okay here on your own ? - Of course . I 'm following Artie 's sage advice . Channeling my anger . I don 't think that 's what he meant . But if it makes you feel better . Oh , it does . Very much so . Go , save Artie . Artie , too . You keep giving me reasons to kick your ass , Mr. V. Ear plugs . Right on time . Please put in those ear plugs I gave you , driver . Place the needle . Place the needle . Thirty minutes . These people will suffer seizures . Then , their internal organs will begin to shut down . Ultimately , they 'll die . Imagine the havoc you could wreak upon an air traffic control tower . The New York Stock Exchange or a Military Installation . With weapons such as these , you can defeat your enemies completely undetected . This is but one artifact among tens of thousands . Artifacts that could and should be engineered as weapons , tools , building blocks for the advancement of your empire . Today , they 're locked away , useless . But with forward thinking people like you and I in charge , we can take these objects and change the course of human destiny . Have I piqued your interest ? Place this Mason 's square in the location that we 've chosen and we can begin . Come along now , Claire . We have one more important stop to make . - Hey , look at that . - He 's starting to warm up . Now , this is that walking stick - that causes earthquakes , right ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry , it 's all I could find at such short notice . No , no , no . I think this could work . I mean , the quake might shake the ice off the statue long enough to bag it - Do it . - Beat smash . Ugh ! - I hated that . - Good , he 's grumpy . He 'll be okay . What the hell was that ? Oh ! Oh , I got a ping . I got a ping . - Ping . - I 'm gonna ... I got it . Here we go . - Give me my ping . - No , it 's okay . I got it . Oh , my God . A bunch of people just fell into spontaneous comas at a park in Rapid City . So , we know what Valda is doing with Sacks ' record player . You know , without pilates resistant bands to keep the circulation flowing , all those people could die . No , with that many victims , there wouldn 't even be enough to go round . Okay , uh , you know what , Steve ? Why don 't you stay here and keep an eye on Artie ? - And , uh , Pete , you come with me . Okay . - Huh ? Uh ... What ? What ... Or you guys can go deal with that and I stay with Artie , huh ? - Lattimer . - Huh ? - Pete ! - What ? That 's the third time today you 've tried to avoid Myka , what 's up ? I 'm not avoiding Myka . Why would I avoid Myka ? I 'm so not avoiding Myka . You 're lying . You know what , Steve ? That whole lying bit got old , six minutes after you got here . Mykes , look ! Pete , some of them are starting to have seizures . Yeah , the record player must have gotten to the E.M.T 's and police as soon as they came within earshot . You got those ear plugs ? - Ready ? - Yeah . Ugh ... What the hell ? Why does he have this ? Oh , Valda . You sick Freakazoid . Pete , I 'm just gonna keep them inside the truck . Okay , I 'll stop the record player . Okay . Wait . Secret Service . Stay inside , don 't get out . Fudge . Pete ! - Pete ? - Mommy ? Hey ! I would 've called , but I figured ... Yeah , what the hell just happened ? Help me . " Chuck Yeager 's favorite L.P ' . " He 's the guy who broke the sound barrier . Oh , my God ! Valda switched the records ! Hey ! Hey ! It 's the Iron Shadow 's underwear . Charles Atlas workout trunks . This looks like a job for ... Ugh . - Dizzy ... - Okay , put me in , coach . - No , no . I got this . Yeah . - Are you sure ? Oh , right . You 've been there , done that . Myka ! Myka ! Mykes ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Oh . Oh . Thanks , partner . Uh ... Ow ! Sorry . - What are you listening for ? - Shh ! Vibrations . Every artifact resonates with a unique frequency . If I come upon a silent box ... - No , no , no , no . Empty . - What ? What did Valda take ? It 's not what he took . It 's what he 's gonna do with it . Benedict Valda is gonna steal the Warehouse . What do you mean Valda is gonna steal the Warehouse ? How ? With among other things , the Setting Maul of Hiram Abiff . The Getty Mall at High Cliff ? What ? Uh , a Setting Maul . It 's kind of like a Mason 's Hammer . Hiram Abiff . He was an architect , who according to the freemasons , built Solomon 's first temple . And his hammer is integral to the relocation of the Warehouse from one host country to the next . So how do we stop Valda if he has everything he needs to steal it ? He does not have everything . The Setting Maul is only one of three artifacts that precipitate the moving of the Warehouse . The others are the Mason Square and the Compass . He 's already stolen the square . So he 's probably already chosen the location of the new Warehouse . Now , the placement of the Square tells the Compass where to transport the artifacts . How does the Compass work ? Once the Setting Maul has been reassembled , it activates the Compass . Then , the Compass sweeps the Warehouse and converts all the artifacts ' energy , directs all that energy to the new Warehouse and that 's what completes the transfer . - Say what ? - It 's like the transporter from Star Trek , minus the Dilithium Crystals . Oh , cool . Now , for safety the Maul is separated into two parts . The handle and the hammer . Now , the handle 's been taken from the Regent Vault . The hammer is located at the birth place of the host country . See , not just a pretty face . So , yes . Now , when it 's time for the Warehouse to move then the two pieces of the Maul are reunited . And the Compass is triggered which begins to phase out the artifacts . To complete the transfer , the Setting Maul has to be struck against the Cornerstone of the new Warehouse facing in the artifacts of that location and we have to stop Valda from doing that . So , Valda already has the handle part . So , we just need to get to the hammer before he does . - Well , I get that . Let 's just do that . - Yeah . Where 's it buried ? The hammer is hidden at the Green Dragon Tavern in Boston . Of course . That 's where the Boston Tea Party was conceived and the American Revolution was born . You three get to Boston , right now . Steve and I are gonna lock down the Compass to keep it from being activated . Go ! Why do they call it the Isle of the Widow 's son ? Well , originally it 's a Freemason 's ... Don 't you have access to Wikipedia ? Look it up . - Look out for the rat ! - Ooh ! All right . We keep the Compass in here , in the Widow Son 's Isle , because this is one of the most secure and safe areas in all of the Warehouse . - So , when you say safe ... - Don 't start with me . Valda ! - He must 've already moved it in position . - So let 's go get it . Well , why didn 't I think of that ? The only thing is , I don 't know where the position is , do you ? As you may have noticed , this Warehouse is rather large . Rather large . - No Valda . - No Claire . So how the hell did we beat him here ? Well , uh , this bar was built over the original Green Dragon Tavern which was demolished in 1854 . So , I 'm guessing Valda might be at the new one . Good thing he doesn 't have a Myka . Why steal the Warehouse ? Why not just take it over ? Maybe he wanted to recreate it . Make it more like the version he knew under Paracelsus . Oh , that 's a sobering thought . You know what I still don 't get ? The record player thing . I mean , was it supposed to be some sort of distraction ? Or demonstration . Hmm . Oh , snap . It 's an open house for the new owners . Guys , over here . - She 's a Regent . - He 's been here . Or he 's still here . What we need is behind that wall . - What the hell was that ? - Sounds like it 's coming from below us . Claire ! Claudia , wait ! Myka ! Mykes , hold on ! Okay , we don 't know if it 's ... Safe . Claire , please , I know you don 't wanna hurt me . I told you , telekinetic rage monster . Pete , wait . If Claire loses consciousness , that thing could crush Claudia . - So how do we stop her ? - The lens . The lens is how he 's controlling her . Put down your weapons . Or Claire will crush her like a grape . Come on , Claire . Fight him . Fight back . She 's still in there . I know you can hear me . You really think we 're gonna let you steal the Warehouse ? You really think you have a choice ? Bury them . No ! - Artie , what is happening ? - It 's Valda . He 's reassembled the Setting Maul and activated the Compass . The Warehouse is beginning to move . I know . Can you tell where Valda put it ? It 's gotta be somewhere under the Warehouse . There 's an under the Warehouse ? Stay ! Not you , Steve . Just put your back into it , Lattimer . If I put my back anymore into it , my kidneys are gonna explode . Okay , this is never gonna work . We 're just going to find another way out . What if that is the only way ... Oh ! Claude ? The second Valda trapped us down here , I started feeling something different , something bad . Worse than the Warehouse moving ? Yes , something else . Something about my connection to the Warehouse . Okay , look . This was once a safe house where Paul Revere and the Sons of Liberty plotted against - the British right ? - Right . - So ? - So , if the Redcoats raided this place during a secret meeting ... - They needed an escape route . - Yes . All righty . All right . So , Paul Revere , right ? One if by land . Two if by sea . Three if by secret passage way . Zoinks ! Velma , Daphne , let 's go . Are you sure the neutralizer will stop ? I stopped being sure of things in 1983 , but if we don 't do something , then everything in the Warehouse will disappear within a day . So , no pressure . You do have a " Plan B " , right ? Silly String ? That 's what 's gonna save the Warehouse ? I once saw this particular silly string lock up the entire gooery . Start spraying . - We did it ? - Yes . Yes ? What ? I hate spiders . Okay , listen . We really need to find out where Valda went . One good thing about Boston is there 's cameras everywhere . So he should turn up on at least one of the ... Ha ! I got you ! Diplomatic Plates . Okay , according to the un database , the license plate with the letters " CY " belong to - the Chinese Consulate . - Outsourcing , huh ? This guy gets more evil by the minute . We really need to loop in Artie . The limo tracks to a Private Airfield outside of Boston , where the Delegation of Chinese diplomats just departed for Beijing . So , he is taking the Warehouse to China ? Man , I don 't wanna work in China . It 's probably impossible to find a good burrito . I would imagine that China is the only country with the financial power and tactical wherewithal to create the kind of Warehouse that Valda has in mind . All right . So let 's get to Beijing and stop him . Well , how ? Valda is already wheels up . Yeah . But we 've got a portal . - I 'm not ready for the Warehouse to move . - This can 't be the end . This isn 't the end . We won 't let it be . Hey ! - Good , we 're almost ready . - Artie ! I think Claire has more to do with this than we think . - I 'm afraid Valda has plans for her . - What makes you think that ? If getting the hammer was all he needed her for , he would 've killed her by now . But he hasn 't . I feel he needs her for something more important . I think I know what it is . What ? That 's a bad tone . What ? The Warehouse will recognize a Caretaker . The first Caretaker of Warehouse 13 was killed in the fire of 1898 . After that , her sister took over . - Mrs. Frederic ... - Had a sister ? So what ? The Mrs. Frederic of the East ? And that 's why Valda was going through the Donovan family medical records . And that explains the bad juju I 've been feeling . Valda is going to make Claire Caretaker of his new Warehouse . Very powerful one that he has control over . I wonder if a mini Tesla grenade will fit in Valda 's mouth ? Claudia ! Be careful ! He 's gonna continue to use Claire against you and he has total control over her . Not total . I saw her fight him in Boston . She 's still in there , I can reach her . Don 't let your feelings for her be your blind spot . Valda 's hooks may already be in her too deep . I saw it , too , Artie . She 's not his , not yet . - I 've just got to find a way in . - Yeah , well ... Find it fast . All right . Listen up . If my contact in China is right , then Valda is heading to the Beijing National Olympic Stadium . - That 's his location ? - If he finds the Cornerstone , and strikes it with the Setting Maul , the new Warehouse will be consecrated . The artifacts will start to phase into their new home and Warehouse 13 will officially come to an end . Okay . Right . Let 's go to China and stop Valda from ordering take out . Argh ! Well , looks like the Silly String 's a bust . Tell me that you have a " Plan C " . We have no choice , we 're gonna have to destroy the Compass . What happens if we destroy it ? Happily accepting guesses on that . This stadium is too small . Where 's he gonna put everything ? According to these schematics , there are dozens of underground levels , each of them several acres wide . It 's also where we 'll find the Cornerstone . Guys ... That says Warehouse 14 . Whoa ! Everything is still in flux . Valda hasn 't completed the transfer yet . I told you . A portal trumps a private jet every time . Now , we need to set a trap for that psycho son of a ... Welcome to Cangku Shisi . Warehouse 14 . My Warehouse . Thank you for providing the means to come to this reality . You 've given me something in this world I could never have had in mine . Complete control . Kill them slowly . I want them to see it all arrive before they die . These buttons are from the lab coat worn by the chemist Julius Wilbrand when he discovered trinitrotoluene . - TNT ? - As the Layman say . Yes , when they 're put in close proximity to each other , boom ! Well , Artie . If we destroy the Compass , what happens when it 's actually time to move the Warehouse ? Yeah , well , let ' em use FedEx . You ready ? Fire in the hole . Is it ... - Artie , tell me that you have a " Plan D " . - No ! There 's no " Plan D " . Valda ! You son of a bitch ! This is my home ! And I will never , never let you take it away , do you hear me ? Never ! Never ! Ahhh ! Is this a rope an artifact ? What 's the Providence ? No ! It 's just a rope ! Stop asking questions and help me ! Pull ! Guys , we gotta get down from here before Valda finds that Cornerstone . Claud , just try . Try and reach Claire . Claire ? Claire , listen to me . Valda can 't control you , you hear me ? He can 't . You 're way too strong . Fight him . That 's just making her angrier . Well , what am I supposed to say ? Connect with her . Claude , find something that you both love . Claire , try to hear me , please ? * Blood and blisters on my fingers * You guys , this isn 't gonna work . Claudia , don 't stop . Just ... just keep going . Claudia , please . * Chaos rules when we 're apart * - * Watch my temper * - * I go mental * - * Watch my temper * - * I go mental * * I 'll try to be gentle * * When I grow up * * I 'll be stable * * When I grow up * * I 'll turn the tables * Fine . I 'll be Caretaker myself . Claire ? Claire ? Wow , I 've always loved the sound of your voice . Oh ! Claud , okay , good . Myka and I gonna try and stop Valda from consecrating Warehouse 14 . Meanwhile , try and get that thing off her eye . I tried , but it won 't come off . Okay , wait , guys . If this lens gave Valda access to Claire 's mind , wouldn 't reversing it give her access to his so we could transfer her artifact energy into ... Claudia , no . I know what you 're thinking , but no . Wouldn 't transferring Claire 's telekinetic rage into Valda just make him more powerful ? - Yeah , you 're right . - No , no , no . You know what ? Do it . I have an idea . I think we can kill two birds with one stone . Mykes , come with me . Okay . Wish us luck . This might hurt . The Cornerstone . It 's so easy to change the world . Concentrate . Focus on Valda . Send him the power . Hey , Valda ? This doesn 't belong to you . I 'll take that . - Say goodbye to your Warehouse . - Hey , Benny ! Check your pockets ! Fork you ! Oh , my ... - Yeah ? Okay . - Yeah . Now get angry about something . I 'm fine . Yes ! - They did it , yes ! You guys ! - Oh , my God ! How many times do we have to save the world ? We should get a raise . Ha ! We did it ! You and me , we saved the Warehouse ! Whoa , you think maybe they did something in China ? - Nah ! - Nah ! So are you sure I 'm really cured ? 100 % Yeah , the music box energy required a human host and as soon as you sent that energy into Valda and he got erased from this timeline ... - So did the energy . - Simple physics , really . With a freaky Warehouse twist . Yay , Pete ! - Okay . - One more thing . - Ah ! - What ? - No ! - Yes . This belongs to you now . No , no , no . I told you , my strongest memories are of you and this guitar . So now that you 're back for good , let 's make some new ones . Besides , I 've already got my eye on this sweet ' 57 Les Paul Goldtop Featherhead . Of course you do . And I already booked us into the unavail coffee house in eight weeks . Sounds like you 've found your calling as a Warehouse agent . Yeah ! I mean , at least until the whole , uh , Caretaker destiny thing kicks in . Hey , I was destined to be in a coma for the rest of my life and somebody changed all that . Yeah . See , Jinksy , it 's all about ... Hey , guys . I gotta go help Artie . I 'll be right back . Oh , um . Hey , you were great in China . Pete ? Okay , Mr. human lie detector . You look me in the eye and tell me I 'm lying . I 'm in love with Myka Bering . Damn it . I know . I just ... I can 't believe that the Warehouse almost moved . We 've been here for five years , you know ? It feels like home . Try 40 years . Little piece of advice , take it one snag at a time . Something I 've learned on this job . Because you never know when things are gonna ... Change . - Artie , I thought we stopped it . - We did . - There 's a problem , isn 't there ? - Yes . We retrieved the Setting Maul . We stopped the Warehouse from moving . Why is that Compass still active ? I had a feeling . Yes . I 'm afraid Benedict Valda 's actions may have set certain events into motion . - Events ? What kind of events ? - The kind that even I may be unable to stop .

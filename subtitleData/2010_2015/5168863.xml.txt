 Wake up ... Wake up ... Hello ? Is this Geoff ? Yeah . This is Samuel here , we were expecting you this morning ? Oh , Samuel ... ah . I completely passed out . Okay , we 'll see you soon . Hi , Geoff Burton for Samuel Mead , please . Injecting room here , got your stereomicroscope . Quarantine room for incoming animals . Microscope room with confocal imaging station - all the usual stuff : Spinning disk confocal , twophoton confocal , upright confocals with dipping lenses , all the laser lines you could wish for . Anything to make science beautiful . We 've got a cold room , we 've got a microbial culture room ; the autoclaves are downstairs . There 's a ... How 's your accommodation , Geoffrey ? Oh , fine , fine . I was just wondering where my office is going to be ? Oh , we don 't really do ' offices ' per se . We 're more communal than that . Of course , we can loan you a lab for the length of a given project . Right ... Look who I found . - Doctor Burton . - Doctor Fiedler . Rebekka 's come a long way since she was interned with you . Yes , so I hear . I 'm sorry I can 't leave this right now . - We 'll catch up later . - Great . - Shall we continue ? - Yes . That way . Now , there 's something else we need to do ... Sorry , I didn 't ... Anyway , let 's get your security pass sorted out . Son of a bitch ... Geoff ... How are you ? I 'm fine , you ? I 'm good . I 'm setting up the new research lab . The one in Munich right ? No , Dresden ... remember ? So , you must be happy ? What 's that supposed to mean ? - It 's nothing , forget about it ... - Hey babe ! I 'm home . Hold on for a second . So ... what 's up ? I heard about your news . When were you planning to tell me ? I was going to tell you , I really was . Fm in my second month , I wasn 't quite sure and I didn 't tell anyone else . Well , Joe and Karla knew . Oh , no . That was Ben . Right . Ben . He was excited about the baby so he just told them . You know ... ? You 're angry ? No . Of course . No . I 'm not angry ... I 'm just , I don 't know . I gotta think about it . Think about what ? Well , what do you want me to say ? Congratulations ? I dunno . Maybe you can be happy for me . What do you want ? Why did you call me ? I don 't know why I called . I miss you . I have to go . Geoffrey Burton comes to us from U-Mass , where his research into early detection of embryonic abnormalities has certainly proved one of the more , ah , fiercely-debated topics in the scientific community this decade . Now , I don 't need to tell you what the implications of this are . The proverbial ' cure for cancer has always eluded us . But the potential of pre-natal discovery certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer . And Geoffrey has now come here to continue his research in a rather less politicized environment , and he 's going to speak to us this morning about the state of his work to date . When you 're ready ... Thank you . Will you now all please join me in welcoming Geoffrey Burton . Thank you , thank you , Samuel ... I never intended to become a geneticist . My PhD. was actually on bacterial biochemistry . But , as I 'm sure many of you know , I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son , whose condition led me to focus my research on screening embryos for traces of rare genetic mutations such as his . I want to make one thing very clear : this is not eugenics . I 'm not trying to develop new techniques to pre-screen people with brown eyes , or dark skin , or freckles . I like freckles . Diversity - one of the things which defines us as a species is to be celebrated . Mutations which endanger human life are not . For example - here we see the subject in the earliest stages . The disease is non-contagious in the traditional sense , yet at the same time , unusually virulent . I 've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton 's Syndrome . What made this syndrome noteworthy was its sudden appearance in what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject . Within a matter of days , the symptoms had manifested as a number of neoplasms , exponentially multiplying and growing in size . These , ah , tumor-like appendages eventually covered the entire body , as we can see . Respiration became increasingly difficult . They began to affect the internal organs - crushing the heart , constricting the lungs ... Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter . From first symptoms to death , the entire process took little over a week . What made this unique was that this was not an acquired disease - like a virus , but a seemingly random genetic mutation occurring in gene RIPS on chromosome twenty . All right . Let 's take a closer look at some tissue samples ... May I sit here ? People don 't want to know the way things happen . This fish , for example - no one wants to think of it suffocating in agony . We just want to fry it , eat it , forget . Same with science . People want the cure , but not the research . It makes them uncomfortable , knowing how you got there . What you had to do , to what . It 's true . I would like to live a million years just to see what we evolve into . Do we become telepathic ? Do we get wings ? I would like wings . And you ? What would you like ? I don 't know . I 'd like to be a time traveler , you know , travel through time backwards and forwards ... Chiba ! Are those incubations done yet ? Hello , I 'm Jarek Novak . Geoffrey Burton . We actually met yesterday . I almost liberated your mouse . - I didn 't know it was you . - It 's me . Your lecture , I really liked it . Great images . Thank you . I guess . I was thinking maybe you 'd like to look at some things I 've been working on ? In kind of a similar vein , you know ? Yeah . Why not . - Good . We should have a drink . - Sure . What about tonight ? Will you excuse me a minute ? Excuse me . Sorry . - No thank you . I quit . - You quit ? Yeah . I guess it has been a while since I 've seen you last . Yeah , that was your choice . I 'm sorry . You know , I ... I don 't want it to be awkward . I don 't either . You know , I have been watching you , though . I 've been watching your rise . Read all your papers . Very impressive . You 're the one who got Samuel to approach me , right ? You know , I ... I felt like I 'd hit a wall with my research . And , you know , I heard what you were dealing with in America , so I thought perhaps you 'd like to come over . I don 't know , to be honest , I didn 't expect you to say yes . What have I said yes to ? I can show you . - Let 's go back . - Good , cos my ass is cold . Have a seat . Okay , so . Now here ... This is a typical regeneration cycle . About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration . Yes ? Yes . Okay , so now watch this one . Did you see ? Ah , missed it . I 'll play it again . Watch closely . You 're kidding , right ? That 's not possible . When I inserted the Easter Gene , I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity of the axolotls , way beyond anything I could have imagined . But since then , I 've refined the genetic code further . Wait a minute , what ' Easter Gene ' ? What are you talking about ? Look ... I labeled only the transplanted Easter Gene cells with the GFP . They were localized in the wound area , but then they completely took over . Look for yourself . That 's ah ... I 've even had success regenerating severely damaged brain and spinal tissue . I mean , can you imagine the possibilities for this in humans ? - Jesus Christ ... - Exactly ! Easter . Why haven 't you published this ? I dunno . A discovery 's not a cure . Even so , I mean ... - It won 't even uptake in mice . - What happens when you try ? Nothing . I 've been stuck for six months now . And then I thought : if anyone could help me with the molecular mechanism , to help me activate it in mammals ... You know , I 'm sorry , I 've got an appointment with Samuel right now . But what do you think about , you know , discussing this later over dinner , at my place ? - What are you doing tonight ? - Nothing . I can cook something for you . German . - I like German . - Don 't worry. it 's not a date . Hey ! Hey ... Looks like we 're having a drink tonight after all - just not together . Come on , I 'll give you a lift . I 'm not going back to the guesthouse , so ... it 's cold , come on ! Alright ... You want to try an electrical cigarette ? Ah , no . I 've got my own . Real cigarette . Ah , I 'm sorry , but it 's a non smoking car . Of course . Sorry . It 's okay . Where we going ? Oh , yeah , right . Sorry ah ... - Pfotenhau ... Pfoten ... - Can I see it ? Ah , PfotenhauerstraBe . Yes , I know it . Good . That 's where we 're going . - I know you , also . Very well . - Yeah . You do ? Yes . Your science . We 're the same , both of us . And how do you figure ? You know . Taking risks . Whatever it takes for a new brave world . New Brave World ? Yeah , I haven 't read that one ... I have ideas , even if I say it myself , brilliant experiments . You could be part of them . Well , that 's a very kind offer . But , ah , my work 's kind of a full-time thing right now . Why did we stop ? You know Mosquitos . Bed-bugs . Fleas . Ticks ... They 're all vectors for disease , yes ? But instead of spreading sickness , why not change the formula ? Make them carry genetically modified viruses . Antigens to their own plague . Imagine releasing these in the third world . In Africa ... They 're going to be bitten anyway . So why not let them catch malaria vaccine instead ? But then first you 'd have to invent the malaria vaccine , right ? - You don 't think it 's possible ? - I didn 't say that . - You know Stalin ? Mao Tse-tung ? - Only by reputation . Both of them believed you could transfer ideology by breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next . And eventually you get genetically-programmed Communists . I mean , I know this sounds maybe a little bit crazy . But there were some really good ideas in there . Huh ? But look , um , what good ideas are we talking about really ? - You 're not getting my point . - What is your point ? There is the idea , and there 's making people believe in the idea , and that is the key to scientific freedom . And financing . Exactly , and you need that freedom to be able to get the good ideas because they can come from unexpected places . Like your son for example . You know , I 'm gonna walk from here . Say hello to Rebekka from me ! So why didn 't you call me ? I could have picked you up . I got a lift , well , sort of a half a lift from that Jarek guy at the Institute . What 's up with that guy ? I don 't have much to do with him . Don 't you get enough of these at work ? I find them beautiful . You know , they 're such strange , resourceful organisms ; there 's nothing quite like them on earth ... You don 't agree ? I kinda always saw them as redundant . You know , genetic dead-ends . But then again after what I saw today , who knows . What about this ? They 're called Wunderkammer . What ? Wunderkammer . They were used in the old days to display things that hadn 't been classified yet . Now I 'm creating new wonders . So you 're an artist now and a scientist ? Come on , let 's eat something . - Alright , go on . - You 're not in training , so ... - Tell me . - What ? - Tell me ! - What ! What do you think ? Tell you what ? About this Easter Gene of yours . Why do you think I 'm here ? Okay , I 'll tell you everything on one condition . - Okay . You have to agree to work with me . Yeah , okay , sure . To fruitful collaborations ! Okay , that 's good ! Because I need your brain . Just my brain ... Alright , that was a little much . You had a big impact on me , you know ? Did I ? You were this unreachable , kind of , star scientist . Whatever . Intelligent and inspiring and intimidating of course too sometimes . I mean even now , what you 're doing is brave I suppose . Why is that ? - Forget about it ... - No , no , no ! Think I 'm a little drunk . You tell me . Just ... Using your son like that . In the lecture ... I can 't imagine what that must be like . - I 'm sorry . - It 's all right . - I didn 't mean to say that . - Yeah , you did . Come on Geoff , I 'm not criticizing you . You know , I haven 't published anything significant in four years . 'Publish or perish ' , remember , isn 't that what we used to say ? They were forcing me out of U-Mass . But you knew that , right ? They were cutting my funding until my lab was unworkable ... waiting for me to quit . They couldn 't fire me , that would make them look bad . You know , my boy , he was the only case . And it killed him . I 'm just trying to find something positive out of all this . You know , if I don 't , then what 's the point ? But you 've made progress . I think I should go . You know , I 'm still a little tired , jetlagged . - Geoff ... Dinner was nice . Yeah , I 'm gonna go . Wait ... You look nice , by the way . See you tomorrow . No fucking idea ... Hi , it 's Sarah , I 'm not available at the moment , but please leave a message . Shit ... So , where is it ? Put it in the fridge . She 'll notice if we take any more . She 's got a whole rack of them . Anyway , we 're doing her a favor . Her research is a dead end . You 're such a thoughtful guy . So devoted to her ... Fuck off . Pass me the next one . Come on , there is no time for sleep ! Okay wait , I have some pussy remedy for you . One for me and one for you . Take it . Arrgghh . Okay . You know , Margaret Thatcher , Iron Woman , she only sleeps four hours a night . Huh , think about it . None of it was beauty-sleep . Very strong woman . I know that . I 'm hungry . I need to eat something . I 'm hungry . I need to eat something . Okay , let 's make a break . Come on . Take it off . You know , Margaret Thatcher , she would sleep maybe 12 years in her life . Normal person , sleeping 25 years - you , 50 . Oww ! Son of a bitch ... - Hello ... - Hello . What are you doing here ? Just working late . In the mouse house ? Is that where I am ? These hallways all look the same . Excuse me . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . He 's in pain , help him . He 's in pain ! What 's he doing with you ? Ah ... Shit . I 'm sorry . - Hey , Sunny , come on . - Excuse me , excuse me . Do you know what an axolotl says to another axolotl ? I love your ' genes ' . Yes ? Ah , Geoffrey . Excellent timing . Come in , take a seat . Geoffrey Burton , Jarek Novak . Yes , ah , we 've met . Jarek and Rebekka made the initial breakthrough with the Easter Gene . I presume she 's filled you in by now ? Yeah ... She mentioned it . Well , I 'm sure Jarek here can bring you up to speed . - Yes . You 're staying at the guesthouse , right ? I can just pop by when it suits you . What is your room number ? I 'll just ... I 'll call you . - You have my number ? - No . I 'm sure Samuel can help you . Don 't mind him Geoffrey . He means well . He just forgets , sometimes , that he 's not the only horse on the track . Yeah , but do you trust him ? I trust all my staff . Yes ? Thank you . Thank you very much . Bad news ? No . Just the usual administrative headaches . Our funders are very generous , they allow us a good deal of latitude . But they 're just so impatient . And that 's where I come in ? You 're an asset to our team , Geoffrey . You wouldn 't be here if you weren 't . But , I do admit , I hope you 're excited by what Jarek has to show you . Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit of your expertise . You see , that 's where I 'm still confused . I 'm sorry , but are you asking me to collaborate with both ? Jarek and Rebekka ? Well , that 's up to you . I can hardly tell you to stop your own research , after all that 's why you 're here . But you must admit , this is a rather unique opportunity ... See , I was under the impression that this was Rebekka 's project . That the Easter gene was her discovery . You know scientists . Always bickering over who did what when . - Yeah ... Actually Geoffrey , just between you and I , this is a bit of a tricky situation . Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further . Yeah , why is that ? I don 't know . But I can hardly throw him off the project . So what 's he working on down there ? I 've got him doing some genotyping . Tinkering away alone in the dark . That 's what suits him best ... On mice ? On Axolotls . He does have some mice thing - his pet project . Viral vectors and so forth . Geoffrey , just meet with him ... I like to thaw him out sometimes . Is there something wrong ? No . No , I 'm just trying to get my bearings , is all . - It 's easier to work with zebra fish . - Yeah , I know . - Hi , Sorry . - Excuse me . I 'm just finishing up some embryos It 's so funny , I thought this morning , we 're like the yin and yang of mitosis . You work on cell proliferation out of control : cancer . Me : on perfect cell harmony . So what 's the story with this Jarek guy ? What do you mean ? What about him ? I don 't know . He just seems kind of secretive . Kinda weird . I don 't know . Samuel thinks he 's some kind of genius . And with you ? What do you mean ? Were you and he ever ... ? Are you joking ? Just asking . So , what 's he actually working on ? I don 't know what he 's working on . He doesn 't want to tell me . To be honest I don 't really care . Something related to the Easter Gene maybe ? Shit ! Rebekka , Samuel told me . - Told you what ? - About the Easter Gene . It wasn 't just your discovery , was it ? - It 's my discovery . - But not yours alone . I 'm not a liar , Geoff . Look , I just want to know what you 're getting me into here . You say we 're working together . Fine . But I don 't even know whose research it is anymore . I don 't even know who 's involved . Jarek isn 't involved in what I 'm doing . But you did work with him . Only briefly , in the very early stages . I didn 't like his style . He was too reckless . He tried to dominate my project . I threatened to quit if Samuel didn 't take him off . In the end I won . According to Samuel he 's still on it . It 's cosmetic . You might want to see this . - Where did you get this ? - I ' retrieved ' it from the mouse house and I suggest you change your locks . What do you mean ? Jarek 's got a clandestine lab set up . And I 'm , yeah , I 'm pretty damn sure he 's trialing your Easter Gene on mice . What do you want to do about it ? - I 'll deal with it . - How ? - I 'll talk to Samuel . - Why ? - Why don 't we just confront him ? - It won 't help . It 's my research , okay ? I want to deal with it my way . You have to trust me . Okay . Do something , Geoff , help him . I 'll take care of it , okay ? I 'll fix it . I 'm just going to take a little bit of blood ... Just a minute ! Hi . What 's with the gloves ? I 'm doing some dishes . What are you doing here ? I 'm taking you to the party . What party ? Haven 't you seen the signs ? No . It 's our big annua ... - Annual . - Annual get-together . You have to come . Everybody will be there . I don 't think so . You have no choice . You 're my date . Looks like you got started early . Is that wrong ? No . - You want some more ? - Bitte . What ? You know what that means , ' bitte ' ? No . Yeah , I thought so . So , what 's up with the trench coat ? Holy shit . It 's an axolotl ! Don 't you get it ? Me the axolotl woman . Right ... cos ? - It 's a costume party ! - I see . - Come on ! I have an idea for you . - Oh God ... Come , come on . Oh , sorry . This is insane . This guy 's trying to steal your research . Geoff , I , you know , I don 't want to create a fuss . Okay ? I know how to handle Jarek . It has to be done discreetly . Listen to me . I know what I saw ... They were fully grown mice . Not embryos ! Geoff . Please . Can you just ... Can you just leave it , just for tonight ? Please ! I want to have some fun ... feel human for a change . Please . Okay ? Just tonight . One night ? Promise ? - Promise . - Now , hold still ... One more thing . Just wait . What ? You know it 's not Boston . I 'm not your intern anymore . You don 't have to feel guilty . Why did you bring me here ? Hold still . Was it for work ? Or was it to start something again ? What if I said both ? Then I 'd say , it 's not a very good idea . Look , its , its not that I don 't think you 're attractive . I do . It just feels too ... Yeah , okay . You 're finished . - Rebekka ! - Here , put that on . I 'll go warm up the car . Hey ! Oh , there they are ! Hi ! Hey ! You look great ! Have you both met ? I dunno . I need a drink . Do you want anything ? They dream ... Did you know that ? When Drosophila lose contact from the ground , they fly . It is instinct . So , we put them in a flight simulator and blow banana wind - smell of banana - at them ; eventually they sleep from exhaustion . Yet we still detect brain activity from olfactory bulbs , representing the pattern , reaction , to banana smell . Which means : sleeping fruit fly dream of banana ... Are you her new boyfriend ? Think you 'll get lucky tonight , huh ? You 've been there before , right ? Professor 's privilege ... And by the way , I want my mouse back . - Your mouse ? - Yes , my mouse . Give me one good reason why I just don 't go to Samuel and tell him what you 're up to ? - What I 'm up to ... ? - Yeah . Tell me , what am I up to ? Well , I know you 've stolen Rebekka 's research . And I saw your stupid lapdog break into her lab . There is no ' her research or ' my research ' , Geoff . We 're just one big organism . Didn 't Samuel tell you that ? No ? Well , you see that would make your mouse our mouse then . And our mouse tells me that you 've been trialing the Easter Gene on mammals . And I also know that it 's working . What I don 't know is how you did it . So go on , tell me how you did it ! Come on . I guess you 'll have to wait and read my paper . Like everybody else . Tell me ! Do you need a doctor ? It 's his own fault . Fuck him . Come . Hello ! Hello ! Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's going to need some serious stitches . You okay ? He ' ! - What ? No ! No ! No ! No ! Geoff , what are you doing ? Let 's make it right ... You 're awake ? Your fever 's gone . You really scared me last night . What are you doing ? It 's quite a dossier you have here . You always go through people 's stuff ? If you didn 't want me to see it , why 's it just lying around ? You know , I saw Jarek at the club . We had a nice little chat ... - Why ? - Why did you do that ? - Why not ? I saw him grab you . I saw you talking to him last night after work . That 's what I thought . So what ! What do you want me to say ? - The truth . Okay , I had a little fling with Jarek . So what ? it was stupid . So stupid ... At least I knew who I was fucking . You called me Sarah last night . I was delirious . What 's your excuse ? Why do I need one ? Listen , I don 't care if you were sleeping with some freak . What I do care about is everything you 've been telling me lately sounds like bullshit . - Bullshit ? - Bullshit . Okay then , let 's just define 'bullshit ' for a moment , shall we ? What 's bullshit is that you were never going to leave her . Despite everything you told me . I never said anything that would make you think ... You think that didn 't hurt ? I was frightened . You know , it wasn 't just some little crush on my professor ... I was scared that it could get out and my career would suffer . That was a long time ago , you need to move on . Get out . Get out ! You know , you have no idea what I 've had to deal with . Oh , come on , Geoff ! Deal with ! You haven 't dealt with anything . Sarah ? Ah , she 's not available right now . Is this Geoff ? Just put my wife on , please . She 's not your wife anymore . She doesn 't want to talk to you . Yes , she does . Every time you call you upset her . - I 'm sick of it ! - Just put her on , Ben ! Hey , who the fuck ! Oh , you fucking ... Squek ... Come on ! Answer the phone ! Where 's Rebekka ? Up on the roof . Hi ... I need your help . Rebekka ... Please . - What is it you want from me ? - I can 't tell you here . Here ! - I need you ... - Geoff ! - ... to do a blood test . - Yeah , of course . - You can run a PCR , right ? - Yeah . - What are you doing ? - What does it look like I 'm doing ? Help me . Can you please just tell me what 's going on ? You 're scaring me ! I was bitten by a mouse ! - A lab mouse ? - Yes . And I 'm pretty sure I 've contracted a virus . That 's not possible . These are the most pathogen-free mice in the world . Not if they belong to Jarek . Now come on , we need a sample from you too for the negative control . - I know how it works , Geoff . - Then do it ! What am I supposed to be looking for ? Your Easter Gene . Jarek 's using a viral vector to integrate it into the mammal genome . Not embryos - fully grown mice . He scooped you on the mammals , I 'm sorry he did it , but I don 't know how . What ? I 'm the proof . You know what , you 're right . Screw the test ! - Where are you going ? - Where 's Jarek ? - I don 't know . - Yes you do ! - Probably in the mouse house . - The mouse house ? - What are you doing ? - What do you think . Please . Let me call Samuel . Oh , now you 're gonna call him ! Call Samuel , get him to the mouse house right now . - Let 's think about this . - I 'm done thinking ! Where are you going ? Stop ! - Geoff ! - Squeak is spelt with an ' A ' , asshole ! - What are you doing ? - You used a viral vector . - Get off him ! - Come on ! - It was infectious ! - What are you talking about ? You 're mouse , it was infectious ! - Get this crazy asshole off me ! - Tell me ! Stop it ! Please ! I 'm going to fucking kill you ! Get off me . Jarek ! Get back ! - Jarek . - Get back . Jarek . What 's wrong , Jarek ? This is exactly what you wanted , wasn 't it ? Get back ! What are you going to do ? I mean it . Do it . - Get back ! - What the hell is going on here ? He just went crazy , he was attacking us ! Don 't listen to him , Samuel ! These guys infected me ! That 's a lie . He 's done it to himself . Waldemar , tell him . - Bullshit . - It 's true . He did . They lured me here . In fact you all lured me and you used the mouse to infect me and make it look unintentional . Put that scalpel down . Put the scalpel down ! Look at his head . The cut . - What cut ? - Shit . Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about ? It 's healed ... It works . It works in humans ! You fucking back off ! Alright , I see what 's going on now . I understand your little collaboration , right ? - Geoffrey ... No , I get it now . You 're in on this , too ! What is this ' infection ' ? Is it viral ? Of course it 's fucking viral . The Easter Gene is an endogenous retro virus . Even though these two geniuses couldn 't work it out . Is this true ? What the hell have you done ? What I have done ? I 've just made the discovery of the century ! This is what I have done . Me , Jarek Novak . Remember it . Happy Easter . Yeah , discovery 's not a cure , right ? That 's what you told me . If the healing 's accelerated , so has the tumorgenesis . What do you think I got ? A day ? Maybe two ? Is this contagious ? Ah , it 's alright , Samuel . I 'm pretty god damn sure that it 's blood-borne . No , Geoff , no ! No , please ! Let me go ! Please ! No , please ! Let me go ! Please ! Geoff ! Geoff ! Let me go ! Please ! I 'm not going to be anybody 's specimen . Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff , please stop ! Stop please . Geoff ! Stop ! There 's nothing you can do . Come back with me , it 's your only chance . No . I 'm going home . Listen , I made a few changes in the sequence , but it 's basically the same . Same ? Yeah . - The same as what ? - Burton 's Syndrome . What ? What ? I requested tissue samples when I heard about your son 's condition . My son ? Why ? Why would you do that ? I thought I could help you somehow . I ... I don 't ... You know , when I started cloning the gene , I discovered it could regenerate dying cells . I mean the tumors are actually a symptom of cell regeneration . It 's regeneration out of control . That 's what happened to your son . I wanted you here to share it . To show it to you , to make you part of it ... I mean , you are part of it . I wanted to tell you . I just ... I was waiting for the right time . What took you so long , huh ? I was afraid to tell you . I didn 't know how you 'd react or ... I 'm sorry , I went too far with it . I 'm ... Why ? Because ... Why ? Because I love you , Geoff . Don 't you see that ? I love you . You love me . I 'm so sorry ... - No , it 's fine ... - I never meant for this to happen . I have my own disease . You know how funny that is ? I have my own disease . It was just research to help you . 'Research ' ... That 's exactly what I would say to Sarah . Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff , where are you going ? Geoff ! Yeah . That 's alright ! You 're drooling again ! Son of a ... Bitch . Hey ! What are you doing ? Hey ! Hey ! Oh ... Okay ... Please open the door . Please come out . Have you got a ticket ? Ticket ? Ticket ? You speak English ? Do you speak English ? Hey ! Stop ! Please stop . Please stop ! Hi , ifs Sarah , I 'm not available at the moment . Please leave a message after the beep . Thank you . I 'm sorry . I loved him so much . And it was just hard ... I did love him , I really did . I really did . Where is she ? Yeah ? Where is she ? Geoffrey . You 're awake . Well , at least you 've got your own room . No , no . No , don 't do that . You 've been very restless these past few days . But don 't you worry . Everything is being thoroughly investigated . Geoffrey . You have been very ill , but you 're all better now . Your recovery has been remarkable ... Inspirational , in fact . Do you remember anything ? Where is she ? She 's right here . Look . No . Sarah . Listen , old chap . We 're going to have to keep you in here for a bit . You 're unique , you see ? But just at the moment , you 're a bit of a danger to yourself . But don 't worry . You 'll be all right . Hey ... You were really sick , but you 're good now . You 're immune . Look at this . Do you see that ? Jarek was right . Burton 's Syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus . We all have it , it 's millions of years old . Only that your son had a very special version of it . And now you . You 're a miracle . And your son was a miracle . Why didn 't your son recover ? Excuse me , I need to take some blood . How was I supposed to know ?

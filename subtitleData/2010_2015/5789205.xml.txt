 I want to space on a 13 month solo mission I didn 't go home alone . My husband created a life like android Called it humanity His name is ethan , he 's the protype This is a story about earth Ethan ... . A story about family . A story about survival . Previously on extant ... Molly : They took the baby out of my body . Are you pregnant ? That 's not even possible . Are we really gonna play this game ? What do you want me to say ? They better have a gun to your head . ( yelling ) Julie : Whatever caused him to shut down was catastrophic . His systems are trying to rebuild everything he is from scratch . He 's still in there . I know he is . Molly : I need another chance . I want to come back to work . We 'll be watching you very carefully . There was a fetus , And it 's not human . Danny : This is the cam from the deep space probe As it was returning to the seraphim On your mission . What is it ? Where did it come from ? Molly : Insert filter . John : Is this ... ? Yeah , when I saw marcus . Davis : The transfer to the life support cell is complete . All vitals are strong . What the hell is it ? It 's a boy . ( quiet whooshing over video ) ( computer beeps ) You should get some sleep . Come here . ( computer beeping ) ( sighs ) What is it ? A wave of nanoparticles ? Maybe a field of carbon atoms ? I don 't know . I 'm not a physicist . It used me to get here . I brought this thing here . You said the sonogram looked human . Yeah , but how does that create a human ? ( ethan yelling ) Ethan ? Ethan ! ( gasping ) Ethan , wake up , honey . Ethan ! You 're having a dream . That 's impossible . He 's not programmed to dream . Mom ? Mom ? ! You 're okay , honey . You 're having a nightmare . How could I see if my eyes weren 't open ? Because it 's not real , okay ? Sometimes I have bad dreams , and-and your dad- - he has Bad dreams , too . Need to get him to the lab . Can 't that wait ? Will you lay down with me ? Okay . Something bad was happening to you . No , honey . Nothing bad is gonna happen to me . Promise ? I promise . ( tires screech ) Automated voice : Good morning , dr . Meehan . Proceed to optical scanner . Access granted . Automated voice : Begin decontamination . Decontamination complete . How is he ? Steady growth , heart rate 's stable at 140 bpm . You okay ? You look a little pale . Just drained . Go home . I can take over . Thanks . I 'll just finish up . ( skin crackling ) You know , if you 're getting a bug , You shouldn 't be in there . Until we understand the immune system , we probably Should just ... I 'm fine . I just need a little sleep . ( trilling ) ( skin crackling ) Sean : This one must be from the psych team . Yes , In fact , I amhaving homicidal thoughts , Thank you for asking . I want to kill whoever dehydrated the turkey chili , Because ... It blows . ( others chuckling ) Uh , mechanical . Honestly , the only problem is This condensation on the hub . It 's slowing down communications , And ben is malfunctioning more than usual . I 'd love some help from engineering . Signing off . Same time next week . ( trilling ) Bring him down , sir . Use the condensation as a cover If you have to , but get him on the ground . These missions are scheduled years in advance . I can 't just pull him down . You got what you wanted with molly . There 's no reason to keep him on the seraphim . Sooner or later , glass will have an encounter , And then what do we do ? It 's not my call . Well , whose call is it ? You were late . It won 't happen again . Get some sleep , gordon . You look terrible . ( phone ringing ) What 's wrong ? We got most of the med team out before lockdown , But meehan 's still inside . Calder blocked the door . What about the entity ? Is it safe ? Vitals are normal , breach protocol was followed to a t . I don 't know what 's happening to him , sir . Who is he talking to ? There 's no one there . Where 's meehan ? Hiding . ( calder muttering ) There he is . What the hell ? Meehan : He 's gone crazy ! Get me ... Get me out of here ! Get the ops team in there now . Send them in ! He 's gonna kill me ! He 's gonna kill me ! No ! No ! No ! ( flatline tone ) Drop your weapon ! Turn around ! Hands in the air ! Shh . He 's sleeping . ¶ ¶ Hi . Good morning . Do you want to tell me about your dream ? Pretty scary , huh ? Well , dreams are just your subconscious Trying to make sense out of what happens to you during the day . What 's a subconscious ? The secret part of you . What do you mean ? Well , there 's the part of you That 's here with me right now . And there 's another part of you That just belongs to you . I don 't think I have that part . Of course you do . Everybody does . Can I stay with you today ? You can come to work with me . I want to stay with mom . Come on , we have to tell the gang about your dream . Maybe you 've got some other superpowers we don 't know about . What do you say ? Go on . Next time . Toast is on the table . Quick like a rabbit . We are still years away From being able to program rem cycles . Whatever initiated this dream simulation Didn 't come from us . Can the program learn how to do it ? Not on its own . I mean , it must have advanced To override the damage from-from the shutdown On the island . If that 's true , Dreams are just the beginning . I need to get him to the lab . I need to get some answers . Here 's how you 're gonna figure this out . What is it ? It 's how ethan 's ears record sound To be analyzed by the motherboard in his brain . Okay . A few nanometers of graphene in a conductor gel . The graphene is stimulated by the heat From the skin tissue . As it melts , It 'll transmit audio to your cell phone frequency . So you can find out what sparks has on sam . So , you want me to spy on her ? You have to find out what they have on her . She was the only guest at our wedding . You spent every summer at her lake house for years . And she lied to both of us . Come on , molly . The roster is not long , and the bench doesn 't get any deeper . I 've known you for 15 years . You 've never loved making friends . Thanks . That 's not what I mean . Hey , sam is working with them . Maybe she knows what they did with the baby . Yeah . ( elevator bell dings ) Late ! Oh . Hey . Sorry , boss . I thought you were julie . What 's with this delinquent ? Playing hooky ? Come on . Tell him what happened . What happened ? I had a dream . Shut ... Up . It was a bad dream . Are you kidding me ? No . He woke up screaming . Dude ! I mean , uh , are you okay ? I 'm sorry . It 's amazing . Worth taking a look . Yeah . Um ... ( clears throat ) Come on , pal . Let 's , uh ... Let 's go probe those brains . Where 's julie ? Late . Has that ever happened in the history of ever ? ( grunting ) ¶ You 're good . I have a lot of brothers . I 'm odin . Julie . Just started a couple months ago . I 'm actually , uh ... Terrible . ( clears throat ) it 's embarrassing . ( mechanical whirring ) ( sighs ) Do you have an o-ring ? It 'll really cut down that noise . Oh . That obvious , huh ? They 're both supers . Seriously ? Yeah . No . I mean ... They 're amazing . Thank you ? No . I-I just meant the , um ... ( laughs ) Still not used to this thing , you know . It 's ... Drone strike , second korea . Still ... Lucky I didn 't lose the whole arm . Do you mind ? Hmm ? ( mechanical click ) How 'd you do that ? I was part of the team that designed it . Okay . I 'm impressed . We make way better joints now . If you want to try one out , Give me a call . I will . So , you want to tell me how you lost them ? Not particularly . Oh . Sam . Molly . Hi . Uh , I need to make an appointment with you . Okay . Paul can take care of you . I 'm sorry , I have to get to a meeting . Okay , sam , wait , wait . Um ... I 'm sorry . It 's just been hard for me to accept that I 've been ... Seeing things that aren 't there . You know what , we 'll do another scan . We 'll get to the bottom of it . I just need clarity . And please , Don 't walk on eggshells with me , okay ? Truce ? Of course . Truce . Kern : We swept the lab . No traces of contaminants or outside tampering . Dr. Calder 's psych eval was flawless . There 's no explanation for what happened , Except for this . It 's the same symbol that was sent from the aruna . Has anyone else seen this ? No . Good . Wipe the footage . Sir , this won 't just go away . Wipe it . I want it gone . Whatever power that thing has , it 's only getting stronger . Kryger and molly were having hallucinations . Now we have a top scientist killing a man in cold blood . You can 't be suggesting that we scrap The greatest discovery in the history of civilization . All I know is It went to great lengths to impregnate molly . And it didn 't come all this way to be put in a box . If it can inflict this much damage now , What will happen when it 's grown ? Verdisign : I have security footage Of dr . Barton speaking to dr . Woods in hallway c . Bring it up . ( monitor chimes ) Molly : I need to make an appointment with you . Sam : Okay . Paul can take care of you . You mind telling me what that conversation was about ? I have no idea . She wanted to apologize , I guess . It appeared more intimate than an apology . Sam ( over computer ) : You got what you wanted , alan . She thinks she 's crazy . It 's hard to keep letting her think that . I can 't keep lying to her face . Sparks : You 're gonna lie if I tell you to lie . You don 't have a choice . ¶ Absalom . A dose and a half . ( snaps fingers ) Chair seven . ( gas hissing ) ( breathing deeply ) Kryger : Is he out ? He 's out . ( trilling ) ( acid sizzling ) ( groans ) ( gasping ) ( water sizzling ) ( panting ) ( beeping ) ¶ ( beeping ) Security , sector 7 breach . ( alarm blaring ) ( alarm continues blaring ) Commencing lockdown . Sparks : Kryger broke in 20 minutes ago . He was the source of the breach . He accessed the central server . He was in and out of the building in under five minutes . He walked right into the front door , with your prints . Sir ... Damn it , gordon ! You 're supposed to be in charge of security . You can 't be the security breach . I will find him- - wherever he is . He stole the aruna transmission file . So , yes , you will find him . And you will put an end to our harmon kryger problem . Do you understand ? Yes , sir . And what about molly ? Do you think she was involved ? Find kryger . Let me worry about molly . ( door opens , closes ) I don 't think you heard me . What are you talking about ? You 're playing with fire , sam . Sam : What do you think I did ? Sparks : Harmon kryger broke in an hour ago . He stole confidential information . I told you he was alive , that he reached out to molly . That is it . That is all I know . I 'm gonna ask you one more time . What did molly tell you this morning ? You think she knew about this ? Oh , I think it 's possible you did , too . No . No , I didn 't . All it takes is one phone call And your brother gets dropped off in the middle of the city With no money , no medication . Whatever he does then , You can 't protect him . Alan . What happened to you ? I won 't warn you again . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( knocking ) Uh , come in . I 'm here for my appointment . Oh . Okay . Uh , come on in . ( chuckles ) have a seat . ( door closes ) Are you still having the hallucinations ? Nope . Not since I woke up in the hospital . Okay . Why don 't you , um , Lay back and I 'll take a look . Okay . Can you lift up your head ? And down . Perfect . ( soft electrical humming ) Ethan had a nightmare . Isn 't that ... Unprecedented ? And john didn 't program him to do it , either . But , hey , we want him to be more human , right ? ( chuckles ) Well , humans aren 't programs . They don 't always do what we want them to . No . No , they don 't . Sometimes it 's hard for me to accept what ethan is . But in that moment , He was just a kid . And he seemed really scared , And I felt completely helpless . And I would have done anything To make him feel better . Of course . He 's your son . Well , he is my family . And I get it now . No matter what , family is different . How am I doing , doc ? Um ... Well , The abnormal activity in your amygdala Seems to have subsided . That 's probably the reason your hallucinations have stopped . I wonder why . ( gasps ) You dropped this . But-but thi ... ( phone ringing ) Hello ? I need to show you something . Kryger , sparks knows you broke into the isea . They 're looking for you . 10 : 00 a.M. There won 't be another chance . I killed him , didn 't I ? I killed henry . Did dr . Meehan do something to provoke you ? She was there . And for a minute , I forgot . Who ? Who was there ? Sarah wilton . From your antarctica research ? I swear to god , she was telling me to kill him . Sarah wilton drowned a year ago on a research expedition . I know she 's dead . I don 't know what you want me to say . She told me to let the baby out . She wanted me to open the door . Do you know what this is ? What is it ? It appeared on your skin before you attacked dr . Meehan . You ever seen this pattern before ? No . What is it ? What is it ? ( door closes ) Man ( over tv ) : Breaking news . The center of the storm is now just 40 miles Off the northern california coast , with steady ... ( tv chimes off ) ( rapid tapping ) ( rapid tapping continues ) Ethan ? Are you okay ? What are you doing ? ( rapid tapping continues ) Are you drawing something ? Why are you drawing this , ethan ? It 's my nightmare . Did you see this somewhere ? On your belly . Ethan said he saw that on my belly when I passed out . He said it was moving . What do you think it is ? I don 't know . But I also know that kryger saw it . I mean , he even drew it on the wall of his trailer . Where did he see it ? Good question . I 'm gonna meet him tomorrow . Molly , you can 't . He broke into the isea . He 's reckless , he 's putting himself in danger . He knows something about that symbol . Maybe that 's the reason he did it . Maybe the reason is he 's crazy . Well , sparks knows he did , so I 've got to Meet him and warn him , because if I don 't , Who knows what they 're gonna do to him . Okay , if you do meet him and you get caught , What 'll they do to you ? Hmm ? Where is kryger ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You stole my prints , you gave them to him . Where is he ? I have access codes to 60 % Of the satellites orbiting this rock . Maybe you 're walking home tonight , A drone malfunctions , blows your legs off . Ow ! Look . Ow ! Stop ! Stop ! Okay , look , look , he paid me to copy your prints . I don 't know anything else . ( groans ) Okay , okay ! Look ... I heard him talking to someone on the phone ... On the phone . He 's-he 's meeting someone tomorrow morning . Bradfield park . ( groans ) : 10 : 00 a.M. ( sniffles ) Thanks for this . ( sighs ) ( electronic chiming ) Sorry I was late yesterday . Charlie filled me in . There 's no record of the synapses That would have created a dream in his circuitry . It 's as if it never happened . Well , maybe we just can 't see it . He 's faster than he was last week . John : Yeah , he is . Listen , john , about the other day . I was out of line . It 's just , ten years , you know , Everything we 've worked for . It 's just hard for me , you know , because I care about him , And I care about you and charlie and ... John : Listen , I have to run out for an hour . Um , can you keep an eye on ethan ? ( chuckles ) sure , no problem . ¶ ¶ ( line ringing ) ( phone chiming ) Dr. Barton . Sam , hi . I really need your help . Molly ? Kryger reached out to me Last night . He broke into the isea . I don 't know what he took , but he asked me to meet him . I 'm sorry . I can 't , um ... I can 't really hear you right now . Your lab results Won 't be back until Monday . He 's in over his head this time . You know , maybe you should call john . The meeting is in ten minutes at the camden library , But I 'm not going . Why are you telling me all this ? Because you need to know . Tell sparks . He 'll know what to do . Camden library . That 's where he can find kryger . ( line ringing ) Alan , I have something for you . ( phone ringing ) Sparks : Gordon , sparks . Kryger 's headed to camden library . Get your men over there . Let 's go . Head down , head down . Keep walking . Let 's get out of here . You 're not safe . ( electronic chiming ) Little man 's on fire . Julie : He 's beating her . Last week he could barely keep up . ( chuckles ) Odin : Julie . Who is that ? Odin . Hey . Odin ? Hey . Is this an okay time ? It 's perfect . Charlie , this is ... Odin . Yeah , right . ( chuckles ) Ruler of asgard , father of thor . ( chuckles ) This is charlie , one of my coworkers . Yeah . I 'm gonna get a sandwich from the coworker lounge . ( chuckles ) Sorry about him . Um ... The clicking came back . Okay , yeah . Let me , um ... Go see what I can find . Mm . Just a second . ( electronic chiming continues ) What are you playing ? A game . Odin was the norse god of war . And also poetry . That 's funny , huh ? Those two things don 't always go together . There 's lots of poems about war . That 's true . Why do you think that is ? I don 't know . I think it 's because we love heroes . Warriors performing heroic acts for heroic reasons . Julie : This 'll work , till we can fit you for a new model . I 'll have to do some blood work And take some skin samples . ( electronic whirring ) ( electronic whirring ) How 's that feel ? It 's much better . Thanks . That 's ethan . I designed his body . You can barely tell he 's an android , right ? That 's in-incredible . So ... I guess that 's the future , huh ? Where 's the baby now ? The isea covered their tracks , Made it seem like I wasn 't even pregnant , like I ... Hallucinated the whole thing . I don 't even know if it 's alive . What is this ? Where did you get this ? You drew it on the wall of your trailer . What does it mean ? I saw it on the seraphim . When you left the other day , I-I couldn 't stop thinking about it . Anna baskov . Think she would go for me ? Ben : Harmon , control is asking for your samples . You know , she dated jensen for a while . He had that crazy beard . Maybe I should go full beard . We 're receiving an incoming transmission . I 'll take it in bay 1 . Sending , bay 1 . Ben , can you determine The coordinates on this transmission ? Coordinates are scrambled . Encrypted ? Or using an off-site channel . What 's the symbol ? I 'm running the attachment through code-breaking software . What happened ? Mission control reports the transmission Is an isea test pattern . What kind of test ? Emergency response testing . Control advises you disregard . Well , whatever you say . Ben , fire up those samples . Let 's knock this out . Okay , harmon . When they told me to disregard , I had no reason not to . It was months away from my encounter , but ... If it really was a test pattern , Why were they so quick to terminate ? Well , if it wasn 't a test pattern , Then what was it ? I think that symbol was sent from someone in distress . On another ship ? Control cut off the v-chron message Before I could see anything . This is a copy of the transmission from that day . But it 's encrypted . I tried decoding it , but it wasn 't isea code . John , maybe you can do it . Yeah , probably . If we take it to the lab . You 're gonna have to do it on your own . Why ? Because every second we 're together , you 're in danger . I 'll find you . ( electric buzz ) ( computer trilling ) The isea uses the same three algorithms on all encryptions . This is something different . I 've never seen anything like this . It 's-it 's impossible . You 're playing it wrong . It 's not a game , e . Can I try ? Sure . This one goes here . See ? It 's a match . And this one goes behind it . Not next to it . See ? Katie : This is katie sparks , from the aruna station . That 's sparks daughter . A virus has entered the ship , and the crew has been infected . Branson is dead . The early symptoms are ... Ethan , go play . ... Exhaustion and paranoia And a-a strange , circular rash . And then the hallucinations started . And within a matter of hours , they had turned on each other . While victor was sleeping , johan came in And he beat him with a pipe And he wouldn 't stop and he said he had been Ordered to do it . And this morning , I found branson in the med bay , sawing at his wrist . ( loud knocking ) The others , they-they 're trying to get in . They 're gonna kill me . Uh ... I 'm sending you an attachment of the rash . I am definitely infected And cannot risk contamination with earth . I 'm going to deploy an escape pod into deep space . Dad ... I 'm gonna die up here . And I just wanted to ... ( loud knocking ) ( alarm beeping ) Whatever you do , do not recover the ship . I repeat , do not recover the ship . She was pregnant , too . The same thing happened to her . She was up on the aruna at the same time Kryger was up on the seraphim . They lied . Sparks said the whole aruna crew died In an oxygen fire . But ... Why would sparks Cover up the death of his own daughter ? Because he didn 't want the mission to end . He knew what was up there . And he sent me anyway . I was the bait . And if they went that far ... The baby is still alive . Grab a coffee . Show her to me . ( whispers ) : Katie ? Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

We are so far from civilization that well you can relax and loosen up a bit . - Okay so . - That 's the spirit , come here . We are far away from Kate 's evil eye . Will you stop talking about Kate , bother I. It 's just for fun . No , you do not like her . I have summarized . So please , shut up , Tomorrow evening is Kate my wife . Do not take it so hard , Marky . If you become totally abandoned mood , when you ' re getting married ? It 's occurred to you , right ? They are afraid of losing you , and be forgotten . I forget them when not ... Is there anything wrong with expanding its horizons ? Not at all , if that 's what you want . Is that what you want it ? That 's not what I mean , Penny . Kate understands me . She is not like them , we grew up with . What 's wrong we then ? Nothing . Kate looks just more of me . I 've heard that before . Pen we were kids after all . Curiously , as we did when grow things together . So , you 're with Josh now . Josh is fun , but not serious . Kate is serious , but not fun . Maybe we both made the wrong choice . It was only one summer . Do not do too much out of it . Well , sorry , I 'm on ! There she is ! Take a look . An abandoned paradise , huh . It 's Never - Never Land , Marky . It 's not even on the map . Is there not a house over there ? It had to be an abandoned island . No people . No home . There you can see , there is no home . See you tomorrow then . - Tomorrow is . - Si , si . Mafiana . But ... It ' s great here ! Cross your fingers for us . Calling the tower , it is Eagle Eye One . Please Mr Arias message that his son should be stoned as a motherfucker ! Do not worry , this will not sail so far . Then there is the landing ! Give us a hand . Will you with the reef ? It attracts hundreds of fish , it would be crazy . It should not be missed . Should I not ? I take a nap , you . We 'll dive plenty . But when you come back , there is a lobster on the grill and a cold beer . - Then come the party started . - But it 's us who are the hosts . It is not enough , there ' s time yet . - If you do not want to ... - Have a nice trip . - Was that it ? - I think so . Hey , that was just them here . Goodness . Here you go . - Cheers . - Thank you . For you and your wedding . Do it for at least seven months . Come , paradise awaits . Kate 's father offered me a job in his company . You 're kidding . You can not just leave me in the lurch . We are just starting to make money ... I have not said yes . Okay , so . Do you have a choice ? Can we not talk about it after the wedding ? My head is full of problems - - And I ' m constantly thinking on one particular . We can not come home with much cannabis . It 's a problem I can help with . - Where 's the fish gone ? - That way . What the hell was that ? - Slow down and breathe . - No , I want out of here . - What happened ? - There is a whole graveyard out there . - Penny thinks she saw something . - I saw ligrester . Calm down , it ' s probably just some fish , as the shark did not get eaten . What did you say ? So a shark ? Ye gods . Are you just as crooked as you seem ? I also want to be with ! It should not happen . The virus has become more aggressive . - What is it ? A vaccine ? - Try to think beyond that . Why make a vaccine against it if we can detect it and kill it ? Listen , take you a chat with Porter . - Keep him busy , okay ? - Yes . - Bridget , you 're coming with me . - Of course . What are you doing ? You should have gone , when I asked you about it . We only have a suit back , Doctor . The others are in the bunker . Whoever has the syringe , get the suit . Do you trust me ? Completely and utterly . This is your mercy . It separates you from the others . - Do they put you to distract me ? - No , not at all . - They test a disinfektionsmiddel . - A what ? - A disinfektionsmiddel is no good . - Maybe for you . It is shown clearly that I never get out of here . I will always be a source of contamination . I 'm dying here . It ' s fine . The syringe grab . There are ' ll be right back . Son of a bitch . Come here and help me keep him . No , I do not think ... Come in here ! That 's the taste . - Penny , you 'll have a steak ? - She 's not hungry . - She 's okay , right ? - Yes , no problems . She just got the wrong foot of water . There must be something jetlag back . Josh , will you come ? Yep ! I hope she has been clean . Daddy does not like salt on her pussy . You talk so much shit , man . Where were you known each other ? Hiking . Close the tent . That 's it ! Right after my taste . - There is something wrong . Watch this . - Jeez . - I told you to take sunscreen . - I did too . - What is it ? - I do not know . - Are you allergic to salt water ? - No , I think not . Do not ! It stings . You are obviously allergic to anything . But now I pick up the first aid kit , and then we get to grips with it . Your legs ! How it started with me . It started playing right after a stick . - Did you also have a puff ? - Yes , just before we went down . So is it just that reason . We bought it in Samana , and now we get a allergic reaction , because it is new . It 'll be fine . Relax . Take it easy , okay ? Daddy makes amends . You still look great out . A man asks his wife : Can you tell me anything which makes me both angry and happy ? His wife thinks about it and then says : Yes , you have a bigger dick than your brother . It was really bad , you . You are in a bad mood right now . Recreate yourself , you will soon get married . Yes , that ' s the thing . Eat them here , so you get better . Girl , however . Here is something you can have fun with , until the medicine is working . Relax you just completely the doctor man is here . Make your legs . There you go . - Does it feel nice ? - Yes . Just lie down . If I had a list , Kate would score top score . But I just think to await something out there . What could it be ? My , they stop yet ? Do you remember that girl a few summers ago ? Her nympho with a heart ? Oh well ... Cucumber - wisp . What then ? - You did not , did you ? - Yes . Do you mean what , in all seriousness ? - By Josh it ? - No , and that he should not . Are you kidding me ? Who are you supposed to be ? First you sabotaging our common enterprise - - And so are you gudhjælpemig also and cubes with your brother 's girlfriend . No , it 's not like that . Technically , he bangs my girlfriend . Ex-boyfriend . Super Secret - Ex - and - childhood friend . She was my physics buddy at school . Clear . What ? It was we . But it 's Cucumber That Girl ? - The one with that ... - Why is it so funny ? Unbelievable . Unbelievable . It ' s damn well done . Does he know what she can do with a cucumber ? Come on . Why have also told you that . It is then mega fat , and this gives actually pretty good sense . She has always loved the salad . Will you stop talking about her . I never should have said it . Why not ? It is the coolest , I have ever heard . - It 's getting dark , come on . - What did I say ? You should relax a little , baby . Gosh ! Josh ... ? What happened , Josh ?

I was trying to protect you . - It was not good enough . - I knew something was wrong . I did not know you took Penny with . I have paid your journey , fattigrøv ! - But not mom and dad ? - Can not we just get out of here ? I do not want any more idiots with for my wedding . You selfish bastard ! - Just out of the family . - You 're damn right in . Hell , my nose ! Let 's find the doctor . We can not go down there again . You know what 's lurking down there . We have no choice . If you have a guilty conscience , you can mess up for it now . Sorry , but you have just broken my nose and door is locked . Yes , it is locked . Try something . You are so clever , find something . What should I do ? Okay , I 'm trying . Now I have tried . Can we go now ? Beware . Hello , dr . Edwards ? I do not understand . I talked to a man . Who are you ? We have a need for a doctor . Dr. Edwards said we should come . - Really ? Sailed in here ? - Yes . We have a power failure . He is in intensive care and stabilizing some patients . He says we should go to the hospital Samana . - I can help , but we must hurry . - Stop ! She 's lying ! I do not believe it , she is infected . She is infected with an extremely lethal and sophisticated carnivorous virus . What nonsense . If I need help ... - Show them your skin , Bridget ! - We 're wasting time . - Let her speak out . - She 's hallucinating . We do not have time for this . Show them your skin , Bridget ! No , no , no . Listen . Before us dr . Edwards . Now ! Come on , Josh . It 'll go all together . Is that him ? My name is dr . Edwards . The staff is in the evacuation time , until the spill is under control . Everyone in the bunker is dead . - Are you sure ? - How can this happen ? Dr. Edwards , you have to look for Penny now . - What ? - Did you answer no to our calls ? Point the gun at him . He lured you here . - He will steal your boat from you . - Absurd ! All of the armor has a radio on the right sleeve . - You can not contact the mainland with it . - But what about the beach ? The award-winning researcher leaves the island and no one will know that he is responsible . - Son of a bitch ! - What happens to us ? Quaint concoction Porter . He will kill to achieve his goal . Is not it true , Bridget ? Josh , take his weapon . Wait a minute ! Let 's be reasonable . Think you now . Was he also infected in the bunker ? We snorkeled just by the beach . My goodness . All of the water was dead . - Did you know ? - Of course not . I do not know this plant . It may well be , sewer leading into the sea . Do I need to know where the garbage is ? If such a dangerous virus unleashed and became a pandemic would the guy who invented the vaccine , become a folk hero . I 'm just trying to save lives . That 's why Porter is so important . He has the key to the vaccine . For your legacy to the world . Now we need you to move out . - You do not understand . - I do not ? Listen , my brother must be on board the boat and it must be now . If the system flushes everything into the sea , have the virus soon spread . We are facing an outbreak of enormous proportions . We need to shut down the system . I promise you that we will be sending a whole army of people who can fix it . We do not wait ! CPEC all plants can be disposed of in an emergency . Is there a selvdestuktionssystem ? - It may come to an end here and now ! - Josh ! Josh ran back and take care of Penny . She ' ll be fine . - Okay . - I 'm coming , I can help . Dobbs , watch dr . Evil . Okay ? Then we go ! Go . Forward . Do not stand there and stare ! Come on ! Come on ! If we do not get back to the boat , so I just sailing . Marky . Get Josh to safety . Will not you ? - Porter , we 'll probably need your help . - Then we go . Go . Can they even help us the hospital ? Dr. Edwards has been working on a disinfektionsmiddel . - Some what ? - A virus kills . If we can reach the CDC in time , it may be cured . You do not look good . Relax and take a deep breath . Breathe . Where is your boat ? It is situated on the beach . No , wait ! We can not go in there . There is a risk of infection . Infection ... Oh god . Someone must activate the manual shutdown . I 'll do it . You can not hide your rash much longer . Shut the mouth . Do you know what the virus next phase ? Severe pain while rashes louder - - Followed by fever and grotesque blisters on your legs , your belly and your face . And so begins your tissues to disintegrate . If you are to survive , I have to To find out what stage it is in . - Try on something and I ' ll kill you . - Okay . Lower your weapons . Just lower it . Thank you . This arm here . It does not look so violently . Your state is shown deadly . Okay , Porter , you must enter the code . Alpha Romeo Foxtrot . 1 , 2 , 3 How it is enabled . Now there 's no turning back . We must down to the beach before it all explodes . Who are you ? I am a doctor . - I need you in the hospital . - Where 's Josh ? You must be Penny . I 've already taken care of Josh . - I was told to carry you . - By who ? By who ? You 'll probably need a referral . Do not fucking touch me ! You 're a fucking ugly bitch . Dobbs ! Edwards ! We must away . Josh ! Josh ? You could not have done anything . Edwards ! Edwards , where are you , motherfucker ? Son of a bitch ! Where are you ? Duck ! - I have put new plans . - Why ? How countering it up a virus ? It isolates those who have been infected , and put the sick in quarantine . Exactly . So therefore he must not leave the island . But he is not sick ! Do not you think ? It was all the others on the boat . What about Dobbs ? You killed him , not the virus ! I spared him from a cruel death . You saw for yourself what happened to your brother . No ! Stop ! You can not do this ! Do not let your emotions take over . I offer you the chance of a lifetime . This moment can affect the entire your career . Your whole life . Just do as I say . Am I the only one who dares to do so , which is necessary ? Do something Porter ! I 'm his only chance , he gets his wife to see . Porter , your wife is dead ! Together ... we could have stopped this virus . You think that your immunity can protect you ? Or you divine ? You are nothing but a rat on a sinking ship . You know what , Doctor ? Sometimes you have to do damage on one life to save millions . What happened to your friend ? Problems ? I need enough to drink . - Have you had time on the radio ? - There should soon be signal . I 'll take some fresh air . All this is due to a small mouse . What ? The images in the bunker . There were lots of pictures . The tracked back to the mouse . It so at least it seems . Porter . - Porter . - What 's with Porter ? What is going on here ? - Water , my goodness ! - What kind of water ? Captain Magio ? Captain Magio . Why would he would infect us ? We are the only one who knows who he is . How much water do you drink ? How much water do you drink ? Oh no . Where is the dinghy ? Porter has taken it . He 's gone . Porter ! Porter , you bastard ! HERE COM virus from the Do not get up ! Stay there ! What is your position ? Are you hurt ?

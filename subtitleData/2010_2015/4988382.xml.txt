 Previously on Defiance . What is it with you and that Nolan guy , anyway ? He saved me . What did Nolan do to save you ? He murdered my parents . We need this mag-lev spur . Not if it means taking a loan from the Earth Republic . If Rynn is behind these killings , we need to find her before anybody else gets hurt . I toss these pheromones , you all die . Rynn , that nest gets any bigger , it 's gonna kill everybody in town . Is that what you really want ? I 'm going to prison . How can that be the correct path ? Good morning , Defiance . This is Alak Tarr on Raider Radio broadcasting from the top of the arch . And listen , I don 't care if you 're Castithan , Irathient , Human , whatever . This music is for you . I 've just received radar and visual confirmation that the land coach has arrived . Hope I get my raisins from Fresno . All right , so just a quick stop to unload cargo and pick up new passengers , then it heads on to Calexico and points west . So if you got business with the big , bad outside world , you need to move it or wait another two weeks . _ _ _ _ _ _ Crazy bitch . Got that right . Where 's the prisoner going ? Changes coaches in Yuma and boards a transport to Vegas prison . Make sure she 's chained good and tight . - I don 't want any trouble . - Don 't worry . The lawkeeper himself 's gonna escort this one . Okay . Let 's go . Well , mail call 's quite the event around here . Well , that 'll change once we get our railroad line . And remember , you 're carrying the hopes and tax receipts of all the folks here that are footing ' the bill . Guess I better keep it safe and sound till we get to Calexico then . This town 's a lot bigger than I remember . Shtako . It 's Olfin Tennety . She 's an E-Rep Ambassador . I 've been ducking her correspondence for weeks . Amanda Rosewater . You naughty girl . You haven 't been responding to my letters . I haven 't been ignoring them . I 'm just not interested in your offer . These are my husbands Kaspar and Ziggy . They 're keeping me company while I do some E-Rep business in Calex . Boys , this is Amanda . She used to be an assistant at Republic HQ . Why would you leave New York to come here ? I mean , the washed-out roads and shoddy vehicles , bandits . Your husbands are lovely . I was drunk . Looks like we 're sharing the same land coach . Be the perfect opportunity for me to sell you on the benefits of working with us . Don 't bother . We 've raised the scrip to fund the railroad for ourselves . I bet that 's it in the case there , Amanda ? You know , the Votanis Collective will come calling eventually . And when they do , trust me , they won 't be offering cash incentives . It 's a really dangerous world out there , Amanda . The Earth Republic is a good friend to have . The land coach departs in 20 minutes . 20 minutes . Boys . Driver 's compartment is off-limits to passengers . Keep the aisles clear , please . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Well , you weren 't expecting a good-bye kiss , were you ? Come here . Now , can I trust you to be a good girl and behave yourself while I 'm gone ? - Probably not . - There 's my girl . - Thank you . - Thank you . Can I get a drink right ... Yeah , just up the block and to the right . Hey . What 's wrong ? Who is that guy ? Nobody . Thought it was someone I once knew . S01 Ep05 - The Serpent 's Egg - I wonder what she did . Why would they let her ride in here with us ? I 'm gonna say something . I will . - Say something . - Excuse me ! Lawkeeper ? Your prisoner here , is she dangerous ? Just steer clear of her , you should be just fine . She stinks . Can she ride up top ? Like , strap her to the roof or something ? Now , now , now . " For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God . " Romans 3 : 23 . Reverend Sy Preston , Church of Harmony . Just out here spreading the good word . I ... can I interest you folks in a Bible ? Traveler 's best friend . Frankly , Reverend , I prefer scotch . But thank you . So listen to this . They have Votan-mex cuisine in Yuma . I vote for the old-world ribs . How about we hit ' em both , boys ? Yes . I can 't wait . I gotta hand it to those two . They actually found a survival technique that works . Yeah , hook up with a powerful woman who pampers and protects ' em . But you don 't like polygamy ? Or are you just against men in subservient roles ? No . I get the allure . Two sets of hands , two mouths , two ... I get the picture . Justl don 't know , I think it 's hard enough maintaining a relationship with one person . Are you kidding me ? This is great . Actually , I 've thought about it . Group marriage , I mean . - Seriously ? - Yeah . I mean , it seems practical in the world we live in . Look , we all have different sides to ourselves . Multiple husbands might give me the opportunity to be all that I can be . Yeah . Anyway , I don 't buy into the whole find-one-true-love fantasy . What ? Nothing , just a feeling I have about you . Please , share . Okay . I think all that talk is just a smoke screen . I think if you don 't believe in love , it 's because you have been in love and you got burned . Hey , handsome . When did you blow into town ? Just got off the land coach from Cedars . Pleasant trip ? It 's murder on my back . Why don 't you come upstairs for a hot oil massage ? I 'll straighten out your kinks , teach you some new ones . Thank you for the offer , young lady , but I 'm married . Happily married . What 's this lucky lady 's name ? Gaya . She lives in New York with our daughter Daimya . I don 't see nearly enough of her . I 've been ... I travel so much for work . Just seems like every time I see her , she 's grown another couple inches . Feels like I 'm missing her childhood . Poor baby . Come on upstairs . I 'll make it all better for you . Thank you . I think it 's time for me to go . Can I help you ? Help me ! Hello , Daigo . Nasty cut . Gonna leave a scar . I 'm Thesho Zajino . My name is Thesho Zajino . I don 't know who you think I am ! You 're lying , Daigo . I know it 's you . I remember your smell . I could never forget it . _ _ _ _ _ _ You tortured me . You 're gonna confess . That 's crazy . I 've never even seen you before . Tell me why you did what you did or you 're gonna die here . I don 't know what 's going through your head , but I know what 's about to . _ _ _ _ _ _ Yeah . Sit . Where is it ? Don 't make me strip search you in front of all of these fine people . Where is it ? _ _ _ _ _ _ Hold on ! Ugarti ! Ugarti ! Nolan ? Something 's coming . We 're being jacked . That blast came from inside his compartment . Nobody 's been in there since we left . The only person in there ... Put the gun down and step away from it , lawkeeper . I ... I 'm just a merchant . I buy and sell precious stones . You know , antique pieces . That ... that 's just something I bought in an outdoor market . I like the symbol . It ... you know , it 's unique . I have no idea what it means . You should . You taught it to me . The Devouring Mother , possessor of both womb and grave . I 'm just a jewelry peddler . I-I have a 3 : 30 appointment with Cadmus Reilly in the Hollows . You 're lying ! My God . Whatever happened to you , I 'm sorry . How can I confess to something I didn 't do ? Wait . Let me go ! Please ! You were right . Quite a haul . That 's not all we came for , is it , Ambassador ? Same source that tipped us to the case says you 're loaded . Well , you should get a better source . Hey , Lash , which one of these pretty boys do you think the Ambassador fancies most ? This one . Definitely . Kaspar ! No , no , no , no ! No . No , no ! Please , no ! Don 't shoot ! Please ! Please ! Tennety , stop him ! All right , all right . Okay . This is a scripchip . Bring it to me . Look , any E-Rep bank will pay up to its cash value , okay ? Kaspar had that on him the whole time , and he didn 't even know ? He died for your money ? You greedy bitch ! I swear to God ! My ... You know what , there 's one basket thing and one heating . I need to relieve myself . Go right ahead . What have you got in there ? - What are you doing here ? - Irisa . - I 'm being held prisoner ! - Who is that ? - Help me ! - What the hell 's going on ? It 's none of your business . Get out ! Help me ! Help me ! She 's crazy ! Don 't . We need a repair shop to get it rolling again . Next coach isn 't due through for 11 days . Without water , we 'll be dead in three . Fewer in this heat . Hey , lawkeeper ! I know you can hear me ! Give us the scrip and we can part friends . The Ambassador here is gonna have a bellyful of suffering before she dies ... Unless you 're smart . Staking Tennety out as bait . Must be in a hurry to finish this thing . We can 't just let her die out there . Man in the chair , speak . She has me confused with someone else . I mean , you 're a lawkeeper . Talk some sense into her . Shut up . You 're him . That 's a fact . - I wanna know why before I kill you . - Kill him ? You can die easy or you can die painfully . Confess . Irisa , what are you doing ? This is crazy . He told my parents their daughter was special , that she had a destiny to fulfill and he needed to prepare her for it . But it was just an excuse to hurt me ! And my parents stood and watched ! I have a daughter of my own , and the thought of somebody willingly having their child tortured , it 's in ... You 're a good liar . Did it turn you on ? Did you get off on hearing my screams ? No , because I 'm not that man ! I told you ! Easy or painful ? Irisa , how do you know it 's him ? I know . I remember his smell , the stink of him ! Okay , what about his face ? He wore a mask when he tortured me , but I found this in his case . It matches the symbol for his idaka church ! That 's it ? Some junk jewelry and his smell ? There . That twitch under his eye . He had that before . I saw it . You think I 'd forget that , zdaake ? A twitch ? She 's gonna kill me for a twitch ? Irisa , come on ! You 're better than this . I know what I saw ! Okay . You keep talking about my twitching eye . But I bet you can 't tell me what color they are right now . What color are his eyes , Irisa ? Blue . No . No . You see ? They 're orange . - They 're orange . - Look , he 's got I.D. We can check it and see if he 's still ... No ! Amanda ! Nolan ! Help me ! - Please ! - The wolfs are getting closer . We can 't just let her be killed . She was dead the moment Preston took her . He 's just using her to lure you out , and then he 'll kill her and the rest of you . Nah . I tagged Preston pretty good in the leg . He 's losing blood . He needs a doctor . Which is why we 're having this little drama . To force our hand . I 'm gonna cut her loose . Someone 's gotta do it . Hold on . You were pretty good with one of these fighting ' the Volge . All right , Preston will come out to meet me . That big Casti , he 'll go up there somewhere . He 's got a handgun . He 'll be high , but close . What are you , clairvoyant now ? It 's where I 'd be if I was gonna ambush somebody . Now , once I 've distracted them , you sneak out and get position . When you spot that Casti , don 't stop shootin ' . If they manage to kill me , you still have the money to bargain with . - Got it ? - Yep . I thought you had more sense . Guess you thought wrong . You 're doing this for her . Don 't get a big head about it . Preston ! Don 't shoot . I 'm comin ' out . Mister , you got some hard bark walkin ' up here like this . You put a hole in me . Obviously , not in the right place . Next time , I 'll aim better . There 's not gonna be a next time . All right . Straight to the coach , okay ? Thank you . Noble gesture . But you have to know that I can 't let you people walk away from here . Thought you said we 'd part friends if I gave you the money . " Trust not in a friend . Put not your confidence in a companion . " Micah 5 : 7 . What the hell is this ? " Ask , and you shall receive . " Matthew 7 : 7 . Funny . You should tell that to the almighty when you see him . Hey ! Looks like you 're gonna see the almighty before me . So why don 't you go clean ? Tell me who set this up . - See you in hell . - Tell me who set this up . Ziggy 's asleep . - Find Rynn ? - No . But I did get their roller keys , so she 's not going far , and Preston 's boys brought along plenty of water . Tennety , go easy on that . It 's gotta last us till we get back to Defiance . Well , not all of us are gonna be going back . The rest of you are going to be staying right here . Drop the gun . And the belt . Come on . And now , you 're gonna tell me where you hid the rest of the money . So you were the source that Preston was talking about . Hey , you got to admit it was a pretty brilliant plan . He steals the money , we meet up later , and we split it . Defiance goes into hock to the Earth Republic , and I get a promotion . Now , if the two of you played ball , he would 've lived through it . But I wouldn 't have . No , honey . You were dead either way . So now , you take the cash and claim you 're the sole survivor . You really think your bosses are gonna buy that ? Why look a gift horse in the mouth ? I mean , with the two of you dead and Defiance broke , the E-Rep will have no problem moving in and ... How did you put it , Amanda ? Sucking the town dry ? Leave it . It 's not too late . We 'll track them down , but if you let him die here , he wins . I want justice . We 'll get it , I promise . But we have to get him to yewll 's while there 's still time . Okay . No . I was afraid . But the snake brings clarity . Everything you said is true . You know , for years , I fled the truth , just like you . I sought refuge in the things of this world . A wife , child ... A home . But none of it matters now because you 've shown me that I was wrong . It 's no accident that I came to this town . It was ordained that we should meet again . Why did you do all those things to me ? The snakes ? Tying me till my wrists bled ? I took no joy in any of it , I swear to you . It was all to test you , to prepare you . You needed the serpent in your veins in order to embrace your true nature . I sought you out . I recruited your parents . They came halfway across the galaxy , and you exploited them . They gave you up willingly . And you were the only one who survived . That 's how I knew that you were the one and that the prophecy of the sacred texts had been fulfilled . You are Alekta , the chosen one . Chosen for what ? - Who am I ? - The Destroyer . The Creator . The Revealer . The Devouring Mother , possessor of both womb and grave . It was the last leg of your journey ... And all that was left was for you to kill the supplicant , and you 'd be complete . Nobody move ! Leave the girl alone ! Hey . Hi . My name 's Nolan . It 's okay . Come here . All right . Now , look at me . We 're gonna go . That 's it . I fled like a coward , basely clinging to my miserable life . But I 'm not afraid anymore because we 've been given a chance at redemption . Don 't you see ? I am to be your sacrifice . My life is your forfeit . I understand that now . Do it ! Become ! What are you doing ? No ! Finish it . Please ! What are you doing ? Finishing it . She was a child , you piece of shtako ! - Stop it ! - Why ? Because it 's what he wants . Let 's get him to yewll . I 'm taking your rifle and one of your rollers . If you follow me , I will kill you . Why did you help us ? You have your laws . Out here , we have our own . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Do you think I could get a ride to the next town ? I kept my mouth shut when you bailed , right ? So ... - Well , keep it shut . - Okay . I don 't like chatty passengers . Okay . Hey , have you ever thought about bounty hunting ? I think we 'd make a great team , man . You want me to go after the irath ? I 'm gonna let her off with time served . You can do that ? I just did , so let 's assume yes . What do we do with this one ? This one . Well , I think we take a play out of the Ambassador 's own book . I say she died heroically defending her two beloved husbands . She deserves it ... But like Rynn said , we have laws . Let 's take her back and prosecute her . Hey , you 're gonna love Vegas prison . Make sure you catch a show at the copa . Take her away . Ouch . I don 't understand why we 're just letting him go . He wanted to create a messiah . Now he has to go back to selling rocks . That 's the worst punishment an ordinary life . Sorry I had to cuff you , Ambassador . Appearances , you know ? I want everything headquarters has on Amanda Rosewater . I want to know where she was born , who her friends and family are , every man she 's ever slept with , and what she 's having for dinner tomorrow night . And I want it on my desk by the time we get to New York . Yes , ma 'am . Sukar said I have a gift . Daigo believes it too , only ... Only he believes it 's a gift for destruction . What if he 's right ? I would say you just proved him wrong . Hey ... I 'm thinking Nolan doesn 't have to know about all of this . You would 've killed him after defending him all that time . Why ? Because you 're not the only one with nightmares . And ... Because ... Good morning , Defiance . This is Alak Tarr on Raider Radio broadcasting from the top of the Arch . I got a treat for everyone . Gonna mix it up a bit today with some old-world vinyl . And ... I got a dedication . Christie , this one 's for you .

 MAN : Commanders , be advised , combat gear check ... Strike commanders , be advised that combat gear check ... WEAVER : Lucas . There you are . Everything is coming together right on schedule . The mining rigs were just delivered . They`re being loaded in now . Good . No point in any of this without those diggers . l`ve been meaning to ask since you got back , what happened to your ... Oh , nykoraptor . Another couple of inches , he would`ve had my jugular . I would`ve been lunch and you`d be a much poorer man . Let`s not count our money yet . A lot still has to go right before we even get to Terra Nova . With the Eleventh Pilgrimage leaving tomorrow , security in Hope Plaza`s gonna be extra tight . We`ll get in . We have the best army money can buy . ( ANNOUNCEMENTS continue OVER PA ) Adjust that vantage point . You`ve got a blind spot . What`s the perimeter status ? MARK : North and South Quadrants are secure , sir . - How many men we got in the tree line ? - Thirty , sir . That`s almost a third of our force . Pull in a dozen , send them back to the colony . We don`t want to spread ourselves too thin . - Yes , sir . - Doc , how are the med tents coming ? Yeah , we`re gonna set up further back in the clearing . We have CO2 infusers if we get pilgrims , and a mobile trauma unit in case we get casualties . Just be ready to fall back to the colony if things go sideways . Dunham ? Remember , they can only come through two at a time , three at the most . So , we use the choke point to our advantage . Yes ? Yes , sir . Well , why don`t they shut this whole thing down and stop anyone from coming through ? Because the terminus` only anchors are in here . Even if we shut it down , the time fracture would open somewhere else within about three clicks . - This is our best shot at them . - Yep . At least we know where they`re coming through . When Hope Plaza fires up that particle accelerator tomorrow , we`re either getting 100 colonists looking for a new lease on life , or an army bent on destroying our home . Either way , let`s be ready . soldiers : Sir , yes , sir ! I really think we`ll be fine . I mean , a defensible location is key . It forces the enemy to play offense , which everybody knows is the more difficult position . Mark gave me a book on military strategy . Romantic . If there`s a war , can I shoot with the sonic cannon ? No , you cannot . Hopefully , there`s not gonna be a war . God willing . We won`t know anything for sure until tomorrow . Besides , this family`s been through a lot together . We`ll get through this , too . All Shannons agree ? - Yes . - Yup . Yup . - Hey , Dad ? - Mmm-hmm . is there any way I can come out there with you tomorrow , in case Kara does come through ? No , l`m sorry , it`s too dangerous . And I need you here to look after your sisters . But , if Kara comes through the portal , l`ll watch out for her . Promise . You awake ? I should have just hung up on them . Who ? When they called from Hope Plaza to say I was being recruited to Terra Nova . I should have just said , ` ´ Thank you , but no.` ´ That`s absurd . This was supposed to be the chance at a new life , not a war zone : Hey . Thanks to you , our kids eat real food . They breathe clean air . I say you`ve saved us . And that our life here is worth fighting for . I knew I married you for a reason . ( talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) - soldier : All right , let`s go ! - lt`s good to go . Be careful out there . I will . We`re moving out . I gotta go . I love you . I love you , too . TAYLOR : All right , well , don`t forget , anything happens to the colony while l`m gone , it`s coming right out of your paycheck . - l wanna be out there with you . - No. I need to keep you safe and sound . Wash , who`d stitch me up ? All right . Can the chatter . Do you have to go ? Darling , we`ll be back before you know it , okay ? Listen , if the fighting makes its way back to the colony , you hide . Got it ? You take Maddy and zoe and hide until we come find you . - JOSH : Got it . - Okay . - All right . - Bye . Bye . ( indistinct ) Go . Say something to him . Now`s your chance . - Let`s roll out ! - soldier : Open the gate ! lt`s gonna be okay , zoe . You`ll see . Stay alive . Everybody in position . ( GUNS charging ) Nobody fires without my orders . ( PORTAL starting UP ) Here we go . Sir , we`ve got tight beam comm-link . lt`s them . officer : Commander Taylor , do you read ? Go ahead , 2149 . Terra Nova , this is Hope Plaza . Do you read ? Over . Hope Plaza , this is Taylor . Read you loud and clear . Over . Commander Taylor , are you ready to receive the Eleventh Pilgrimage ? What do you think ? I think they`re following protocol . Which is exactly what I would do if I were planning an attack . Hope Plaza , we are ready to receive . Commencing portal transfer . Stand right there . Hold your fire . Daddy ! Daddy ! Peter ? All right , the first three pilgrims check out . Stand by . Maintain your positions . - Move those kids out . - Yes , sir . Move `em through . I got this one . - Kara ? - Mr . Shannon ! Please , help me . Bomb ! ( distorted ) ( MUFFLED screaming ) ( GASPS ) ( HlGH-PlTCHED FREQUENCY ) ( MUFFLED ) ( inaudible ) Elisabeth . Elisabeth . ( MUFFLED HONKlNG ) - ( distorted ) Can we help you ? - Taylor ! Go back ! Now ! You need to leave and you need to leave now . lt`s okay . He`s with me . - Elisabeth ? - lt`s me . He`s just disorientated , okay ? He doesn`t mean any harm . Come on . ( PEOPLE talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) - What happened ? - l`ll explain everything when I get inside . - Where`s the kids ? - lt`s okay . They`re at home . They`re safe . There . That should help . Can you hear me now ? Elisabeth , what`s going on ? The last thing I remember was the explosion . That was three days ago , Jim . Why did they set it off ? Were they trying to un-tether their fracture ? It reopened close to the colony . Their army came through and headed straight for the gates . There was no way Taylor could make it back in time . But there were soldiers here ? Washington ? Yeah . She held them off as best she could . Twenty-six people killed before she finally surrendered . What about Taylor ? Nobody`s heard from him . MAN : Get Dr. Shannon . Dr. Shannon ! Bed six is bleeding out . Go and see the kids . Daddy , you`re okay , you`re okay ! Of course l`m okay . You didn`t think a little explosion would stop your old dad , did you ? - l`m so glad you`re home . - My girls . Me , too . Hey , where`s Josh ? Dad . Kara . lt`s my fault for trying to get her here . If I had just left everything alone , she`d still be alive . ( sobbing ) Oh , l`m sorry. l`m so sorry . ( indistinct shouting ) zoe`s finally asleep . Where`s my gun ? First thing they did was confiscate all the weapons . l`m surprised they left us with a bread knife . lt`s the search lights . Start at nightfall . Curfew`s from 8 : 00 . lt`s like being back in Golad Prison . Why go to the trouble of keeping us all here ? Why didn`t they just clear the colony out ? We`re hostages . Taylor won`t try and retake the colony if there are still civilians inside . is anyone fighting back ? Less and less . We`re outnumbered . And anyone who does try to resist are sent straight to the brig , or worse . - ls that where Washington is ? - No . They keep a close eye on her , though . I think they like to have her out where people can see her . Reminds us that they`re in charge . Yeah , I gotta go talk to Wash . ( soldiers laughing ) Here we are , gents . Now , that`ll be 18 terras . On second thought , this round`s on the house . ( soldiers cheering ) Drink up , boys . We got thirsty work ahead of us . Wash . Shannon . You`re awake . They told me it didn`t look good for you . lt`s okay now . Listen , I need to know what`s going on here . Who the hell are these people ? They`re the Phoenix Group . Private military . Killers for hire . Who hired them ? Whoever Lucas is working for in 2149 . All I know is , they must have deep pockets to mount an operation this big . We fought them best that we could . But once they started shelling the colony and killing innocent people , there was nothing I could do . Except raise the white flag . Okay . So , what`s the plan ? Do I look like someone who has a plan to you ? No . You look like someone who`s punishing herself for doing what she had to do to save innocent lives . You got a way to contact Taylor ? ( whispering ) No . They got this colony in lockdown . Nothing gets in or out without them knowing about it . They came here to strip-mine the place . But how they gonna ship anything back to 2149 when they blew up the terminus ? They brought a new one back with them to make the fracture go both ways . Lucky for us , they had a run-in with a pack of carnos and snapped the thing in half . Chalk one up for the Cretaceous . Yeah , well , don`t get too excited . They`re fixing it . And when I say ` ´ they , ` ´ l mean Malcolm . Listen , these guys think it`s all over . But we can still fight `em . What do you have in mind ? Oh , we hurt `em . And we keep on hurting them until they`re gone . You see , I like the sound of that . Jim Shannon ? Nurse . This is Jim Shannon`s bed . What happened to him ? Did he not pull through ? He was stable last time I checked in on him . ( welding ) Jim , hey , you`re awake ? Yeah , so I keep hearing . This all feels like a bad dream . What are you doing here ? Do they know you`re up and about ? You mean Lucas and Mira ? Yeah , I mean , you were Taylor`s right hand . They`ll be looking for you . Why are you working for them , Malcolm ? One , l`ve been pressed into service . You`ll notice my assistant McCormick isn`t in the lab with me ? See that window , that`s where they put his head when I refused to help . Then they let him bleed out on the floor . Malcolm , l`m sorry about McCormick , but if you fix that terminus , they`ll start shipments to 2149 . They get a taste of what Terra Nova has to offer , they`ll send more men and more equipment , - and we won`t stand a chance . - Yeah , I know , I know . That`s why l`m working as slowly as I can . But fortunately for us , as brilliant of a physicist as Lucas is , he`s no engineer , so he hasn`t quite caught on yet . That`s good . Well , keep , I don`t know , dragging it out . Hopefully it`ll buy us some time to find Taylor . - ( SHUSHES ) - ( indistinct talking OVER radio ) ( whispering ) We`ve got a problem . mira : Shannon`s Taylor`s go-to . He`s smart , capable and dangerous . And he might just know where Taylor is . By all means , we should talk to him . Shannon ? Shannon ? Hey , we`re talking to you ! He can`t hear you . The blast took most of his hearing . ( lN raised voice ) Hey , Jim. lt`s okay . Here they are. l`ve adjusted them for you . Now remember , stay off your feet as much as you can . Where`s my father ? Where`s Taylor ? Taylor ? Lucas Taylor . I know who you are. I know who you are . Apparently the concussion caused a sub-cranial swelling . I don`t think he even knows where he is . Yeah , he`s not gonna help us find my father . Malcolm , I want an update on how the terminus is coming . Step it up , or the next head through a window is yours . Jim . Go home . Be with your family . A little early , isn`t it ? Any luck getting a signal to Hope Plaza ? Just got off with our employers . You know , things couldn`t be going better on their end . As far as the general public`s concerned , there was a containment breach at Hope Plaza and the place had to be evacuated . The media`s reporting it`ll take years to clean up the radiation . Which means as soon as the terminus is up and running , we can start shipping everything we mine through Hope Plaza and no one will ever be the wiser . Our employers did have one request of you , as a matter of fact . I take it you`re familiar with an area called the Badlands ? They`d like you to take a little trip . What for ? There`s nothing out there . Ours is not to question why . If you`ll excuse me . You can go . You wanted to see me ? You betrayed me to my father . Yeah , I kind of did , didn`t I ? I should make an example of you , but l`ve decided to forgive you instead , because I understand . He`s like a father to you , isn`t he ? Yeah , you could say that . Well , you know what that makes us then ? Brother and sister . And how could I ever hurt my sister . Don`t betray me again . Next time I won`t be so forgiving . soldier : All right , move . Move ! Next ! - l hate them ! I hate all of them ! - ( SHUSHlNG ) Easy . Take it easy . We`ve gotta do something . We gotta find a way to fight back . Hey , you wanna help ? Go ask Boylan for your job back . Why ? A lot of these Phoenix guys hang out at his place . Drunken soldiers talking shop . You never know what you might overhear . Here you go . Next . elisabeth : Okay , judging by the number of entry wounds , this should be the last bullet . Looks intact . Can I go ahead and close him up then ? Dr. Shannon . So what am I looking at here ? I pulled a couple of bullets from a Phoenix soldier they brought in after a skirmish with Taylor`s men . Look , I noticed this . That isn`t a serial number . Someone did that by hand . Yeah . So I went back and I checked all the other bullets we retrieved . And they`ve all got the same number hand-etched in the metal . Taylor , you sneaky bastard , you finally checked in . They`re map coordinates . A rendezvous point ? Except now I gotta figure out a way past those guards and get outside the gates . Hey , wait , that , that`s my rover ! And that`s my army . - All right ! - See this bug bite ? Yeah. I can`t even begin to describe the insect that did this to me . Some kind of winged-spider-snake . What about the pyro-sonic ? is it loaded up and ready to go ? - Yes , sir . - All right , careful with it . lt`s the only one we got . Damn thing growled at me , Lucas . Pretty sure bugs aren`t supposed to growl . Let`s go . Wait ! ( HONKlNG ) Why are we stopping ? Hey , move out of the way . The damn motor`s dead again . Third time this month . - You have to move , now ! - Hey , what the hell you doing ? Hey , come on ! What are you thinking ? The guy`s in a wheelchair . Cut him a break , why don`t you ! Hey , move out of the way ! Listen , what are you ... Have you got anything compassionate about you ? - This guy is in a wheel ... - Sir , stand back ! - soldier 1 : What`s the holdup ? - All right . That`s cool . Whatever . Just ... soldier 2 : Get him out of the way . Dr. Taylor , Mr. Weaver . So , what are we looking at here ? Because all I can see is a bunch of trees . HOOPER : This whole valley is rich with meteoric ore . There are impact craters everywhere , you just can`t see `em because of the canyon . How much is out there ? Couple of hundred thousand tons , easy . LUCAS : See , Weaver , I told you , you`re gonna be a rich man . My own Dome . That`s what l`m gonna do with my share . Buy my very own Dome . Hey . Look at that thing . Of course , the only problem we have is the wildlife . lt`s not safe to get started until we clear them out . After what those carnos did to the terminus , can`t be too careful . ( GUN charging ) ( MOANlNG LOUDLY ) There . One less problem . That was a brachiosaurus . They`re harmless . - Whatever . - What`s the plan ? We`ll plant the charge about 10 clicks in . We`ll detonate from this ridge , and boom , the blast will strip the entire valley of all foliage and wildlife . So we can mine it unobstructed . Today`s just a hint of what`s to come . With just 10 pyro-sonics , we can strip half the continent . That`s what I like to hear . Be one hell of a barbecue down there . ( device BEEPlNG ) ( LOUD screeching ) ( sighs ) - Mr . Shannon . - Reynolds . We`ve been keeping an eye on this spot for days , hoping that someone would get our message . How`s Maddy ? is she okay ? The whole family`s safe . Give me your comms . I need to talk to Taylor . We got a situation . You say they got some kind of a pyro-sonic charge ? They`re planning to detonate it from a ridge just south of Triple Junction . - Excuse me , sir . - Talk to me , Reilly . If they`re using a remote trigger , that means we can trace the signal straight to the charge . If we get you there , can you diffuse the damn thing ? - The sooner the better . - All right . Let`s go , people . Hey , l`m glad to see you`re in one piece . Likewise . All right , it`s armed . l`ll let it rip once we clear the blast radius . Listen , l`m a little worried about leaving it out here like this . Maybe , you know , we should leave someone behind to guard it . Yeah , good one . You were joking ? I suppose . All right , let`s go ! Okay , we`re heading back now . Copy that . Standing by . TAYLOR : All right , let`s get this done . If they get up to that ridge , they`re gonna set this sucker off . - Reilly . - l`m on it , sir . Oh ! Never seen a decompiler like this one before . Must be Russo-Chinese . There`s not a lot of time for a learning curve here , Reilly . - Can you do it ? - Of course , sir . Lucas , come in , it`s Weaver . Go ahead . Infrared shows movement near the charge . Please tell me you`re still down there . lt`s my father , I knew it . Blow it , Weaver ! Set it off ! No ! Hang on ! We`re still in the blast zone ! Weaver , hold on . How much farther ? Another three clicks . ( rapid beeping ) - What`s that ? - lt`s all right . lt`s just letting me know it`s powering up , getting ready to explode . Drive faster . And how long before it`s , you know , not ready to explode ? Corporal ? If everyone could just shut up for a second ... sir . soldier : Reynolds , they`re approaching the ridge . They`re almost clear of the blast zone , sir . Fire up the Rhino . One way or the other , we`re leaving in a hurry . Yeah , we`re almost clear . Weaver , just blow the damn thing . Just a few more seconds . TAYLOR : Reilly . ( explosive BUzzES ) ( POWERlNG DOWN ) ( sighs ) RElLLY : Done ! ( BUzzES ) What the hell happened ? Either this detonator is broken or your father diffused the bomb . Here . Give it to me . ( BUzzlNG ) Good job , Corporal . Secure the pyro-sonic . Let`s get out of here . Incoming ! Everybody all right back there ? - Yes , sir . - All good , sir . Son of a bitch ! jim : We lost 26 before the colony fell . Twenty-six dead . ( TAYLOR EXHALES ) We lost two our first night here before we had a chance to secure the perimeter . Carnotaurs . They got Bailey and Gonzalez . He was 22 years old . Good kid . Good soldier . As I understand it , Gonzalez was engaged to be married . How`s Wash holding up ? She`s been better . She ... - She feels like she let you down . - No . She made the only decision she could . - Surrender the colony . Tell her I said so . - l will . You should be getting back before they miss you . Take this . Stay in touch . I got it on a rotating frequency . There`s no way they can lock in on it . So , what now , Commander ? We just keep on hitting them . We won this round , but this ain`t over . Not by a long shot . ( DOOR OPENS ) Train station . Found him wandering around on the wrong side of the perimeter . - Where`s the train station ? - lt`s okay , Dad . - lt`s not there anymore . - Let me help you . soldier : Next time , keep an eye on him or he comes home in a body bag . elisabeth : Okay , thank you . Thank you . - Are you okay ? - That was too close . l`m the one who found you . After the explosion , I mean . You were lying so still . I haven`t been that scared since the day we first came to Terra Nova and they pulled you aside at Hope Plaza . Jim , I was so sure I was never gonna see you again . But you did see me again . `Cause no matter how bad things get , you can always count on me showing up , right here , every time . `Cause I make it my mission in life to always find my way back to you . ( MAN GROANS ) ( talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) ( groaning ) soldier : ... we were set up . - Not again . - Evening patrol . Three dead , four wounded . How many of theirs did we get ? None , sir . They saw us coming . Someone`s helping my father . Shannon , table four needs a refill . Another Shannon , huh ? You seem to be everywhere . is there anything else I can get for you ? You look sad . You didn`t ... You didn`t lose a friend in all this , did you ? Buck up , kid . Here`s a terra . Go buy yourself a new friend . ( LUCAS CHUCKLES ) There she is . My beautiful sister . Join me . You mind ? Three`s a crowd . Hi . So , I asked you here `cause l`m curious about something . Our father , what did he say when he found out that you were spying for Mira in exchange for your mother`s life ? Did he forgive you ? Not that it`s any of your business , but he hasn`t said a word to me . I can imagine how much that must hurt you . Well , he just needs time . Sooner or later , I know we`ll talk . I wouldn`t be so sure . l`ve been waiting my whole life for him to forgive me . Forgive you for what ? For being born , dear sister . For the unforgivable act of being born . - Please don`t do that . - You are so beautiful . Okay . Please let go . Stop it ! Excuse me . ( GRUNTlNG ) JOSH : Get up ! ( groaning ) - BOYLAN : Hey , mate . Not in my bar ! No ! - Come on ! Take it easy ! He`s just a kid ! - Hold him up . - SKYE : No ! Lucas , Lucas , no ! No ! So , I think I figured out what`s up with all the activity around the perimeter fence . They`ve installed some kind of new detection grid . So we`re gonna need a Phoenix access card to disable it . - ( FOOTSTEPS approaching ) - SKYE : Mr. Shannon ? lt`s Josh . ( groaning ) All right ! All right ! Enough . ( soldier laughing ) I gotta say l`m a little hurt . l`ve been nothing if not generous in my treatment of you people . You brought this on yourself . And now l`m gonna have to make an example of you . ( GRUNTlNG ) ( GUNS charging ) Search him . I have to say , Sheriff , the limp , very convincing . My father would`ve been impressed . Did you have a good laugh about it last time you saw him ? I don`t know what you`re talking about . No ? Okay . Transponder . So , that`s how my father always knew when and where to hit us . Planting these on our vehicles , Shannon ? Clever . Where`s my father ? ( shouting ) Where is he ? Maybe I can help you remember . Take him to the brig . Both of them . l`m sorry . Don`t be . You did what everyone around here has been wanting to do for days . You take it way too easy on me . But I get it now . For the longest time I was so mad at you for going off on that population control officer back in Chicago . But sometimes you can`t help yourself . ( DOOR opening ) You want the good news or the bad news first , Sheriff ? Surprise me . The good news is , your son`s free to go . - No. l`m staying with him . - Josh . Believe me , I wanted to kill you , young Shannon , a lot . But I was persuaded otherwise . - Dad . - Let`s go . - Dad ! Dad ! - Hey . Take it easy . - Dad ! - lt`s okay , Josh . No ! Don`t touch him ! - Cool toy . - lsn`t it ? Where`s my father ? - Mom ! - elisabeth : Josh ? - Mom ! - What ? What happened ? lt`s Lucas . He`s got Dad . I don`t know how you people stand this place . Hold still . Bugs the size of dogs . Plants that eat children . Why would anyone want to live in this nightmare ? What did you just give me ? An antihistamine for the itching . elisabeth : l`ll take it from here . Thank you , nurse . Hello . l`m Dr. Shannon . You feeling any better ? No. lf anything , the itching just got worse . Have you ever heard of Trichomonas sastrei ? lt`s a parasite known to cause heart lesions in slashers . In humans , the larvae attacks the central nervous system and burrow their way into the brain stem . From what I understand , it`s quite an excruciating way to die . Why are you telling me this ? Because you`ve just been injected with a half a million Trichomonas larvae , I switched out your antihistamine . Lucas Taylor`s detaining my husband and you are going to help me get him out in exchange for the cure . One of these is an anti-parasitic . The other two are poisonous . And only I know which is which . And as soon as my husband is free , I will tell you . Do we have a deal ? ( screaming ) LUCAS : We don`t have to keep doing this . Just tell me where my father is . What the hell did he do to make you hate him so much ? - ( electricity surging ) - ( groaning ) What happened in Somalia ? He told you about that ? He said he couldn`t save your mother . You blamed him for her death . He could have saved her . He chose not to . He let her die . He watched her die . - l don`t believe you . - l was there ! I was there when the rebels took the city . When they lined the civilians up and told my father and his soldiers that they had to choose . Each soldier could save one person , just one . They would`ve just executed me on the spot . But her , her they took their time with . Lucas , what happened was not his fault . They made him choose . You can`t blame him for that . No . He blamed me . I could see it in his eyes . Even at 14 . And every time I disappointed him , and every time I didn`t live up to his expectations of what the great Nathaniel Taylor`s son was supposed to be . Lucas , you put this all on yourself . You , don`t patronize me . ( jim SCREAMS ) Lucas ! We located your father`s camp . An assault team`s getting ready to roll out . - l want to be there . - Figured you would . They`re leaving from the South Gate . Keep him alive . ( sighs ) Jim ! What did they do to you ? The cure ! Give it to me . How long before it starts killing the parasites ? - Parasites ? What parasites ? - The ones you ... You were bluffing ? You`re a highly suggestible hypochondriac , Mr. Weaver . I suggest you see a doctor about that . Josh ! - Did you just give me a ... - A sedative ? Yeah , I did . Josh ! Now , help me get your father out . We don`t have much time . Come on , girls . We`re getting out of here . - Mom ? - Yeah . That was awesome . LUCAS : Weaver ! There`s no one at the gate . ( panting ) Skye managed to get a message to Taylor`s camp . They`re sending someone for us , but we have to make it to the tree line , okay ? With Josh`s help I think I can make it . ( ALARM blaring ) They`re looking for us . LUCAS : Shannon`s escaped . Weaver`s gone missing . - You two , around the back . - Yes , sir . He`s alive . - Idiot . - All clear . They`re gone . No one`s here . Wake this guy up . Let`s find these people ! soldier : I got nothing over here . ( FOOTSTEPS approaching ) Wash ! You made it . Durwin was right about the new perimeter grid . I disabled it with this controller . We got five minutes until they realize that that section is down . Where`d you get your hands on that ? Swiped if off a very drunk guard at Boylan`s . He`s not going to stay drunk forever . Once they trace that back to you , they`ll know you helped us escape . You got to come with us . lt`s 100 yards . We`ll never make it to the tree line unless someone distracts those guards . Wash , the plan was for you to come with us . There`s no other way . You go , and you save your family . Give Taylor a message for me , would you ? - Remind him about Cu Lao Cham . - Cu Lao Cham ? I don`t know what that is . He`ll understand . - Now , you get ready to run like hell . - How will we know when ? You`ll know . Thank you . Wash ... - Mommy . - lt`s okay , sweetheart . Just get ready , okay . - Now . - Come on . soldier : Suspect spotted ! Moving east . ( shouting lNDlSTlNCTLY ) elisabeth : Go , go , go , go . TAYLOR : Here they come . - Dunham , bring them in . - Yes , sir . ( soldiers clamoring ) ( GRUNTlNG ) Let`s go . Come on . You helped the Shannons escape . Where are they ? Tell me which way they went and I might let you live . TAYLOR : Load up . We got to go . soldier : Yes , sir . Okay ? Good. lt`s okay . What happened to Wash ? She stayed behind , so we could get out . You have three seconds before I shoot . Taylor , no . lt`s suicide . You can`t . One , two : You know , you have your father`s eyes . - ls it true about Wash , Commander ? - l`m afraid so . - She was a good soldier . - That she was . Get these folks settled . They`ve had a long night . is this where we`re going to live now , Daddy ? Just for a little while , until the bad people go away , and we`ll go home again , okay , sweetie . - ls Mark Reynolds around ? - He`s on patrol duty . Okay . Ah , hell . Dunham ! - Find Reynolds and take his shift . - Me ? Why ? - Just do it , Private . - Thanks . Well ? You find anything out there in the Badlands ? We found something . Wait . We held up our end of the bargain . When are you going to hold up yours ? - Don`t worry . You`ll be paid . - l`m talking about going back to 2149 . I want to see my daughter . As soon as the terminus is repaired , you and your people are free to go . Commander Taylor , sir ? Hey , zoe Shannon . l`m really sorry about what happened . Lieutenant Washington was a nice lady . She saved us . She did her duty , right up till the end . ( TAYLOR CHUCKLES ) She taught me how to make a fire . - Did she now ? - ln survival training . What else did she teach you ? Which way`s north . And which way is it ? That way . She taught you good . ( sobbing SOFTLY ) Thanks . If you need another hug , just ask . You okay ? Just thinking . How many more people are going to die before this thing is over ? They`re bringing reinforcements . They`re going to bring back more men , and more equipment . And they`re going to keep bringing them back , whatever it takes . We can`t give up hope , Jim . Okay ? `Cause that`s what this place is about . lt`s about hope , and a second chance . And we cannot let them take that away from us . All right ? l`m going to go talk to Taylor . Give him Wash`s message . Okay . - l missed you so much . - Me , too . ( distant animal growling ) Carnotaur . lt`s okay . The perimeter`s mined . Besides , you can tell by the call , it`s just a juvenile . Yeah . Actually , they may be smaller , but juveniles are even more vicious . Kind of like hormonal teenagers with claws . ( LEAVES rustling ) Whoa ! - Dad . - Don`t mind me. l`m just passing through . - l got sentry duty . - l should get back . Cu Lao Cham ? Wash told you to remind me of Cu Lao Cham . I don`t know what it means . Our unit was pinned down on the island . We were outnumbered two to one . The only way on or off was a bridge to the mainland . So we blew the bridge so they couldn`t bring any more troops across . So even though it was your only way out , you trapped yourselves there . Well , we figured two to one was better than three to one . So , what the hell . Let`s make our stand . What happened ? l`m still here , aren`t I ? The portal , that`s Cu Lao Cham bridge . As long as it`s open , they`ll keep bringing forces back till we`re overwhelmed . And then they can start strip-mining and plundering this place for everything it`s worth . They`ll kill this world just as sure as they killed the world we left behind . Unless we blow the bridge . That`s what Wash was trying to tell us . Wait , now . Are you talking about taking out Hope Plaza ? That I am . Taylor , even if we could find a way to do it , we`d be cutting ourselves off , too . That means no more meds , no more technology . No more colonists . A thousand people is all we`d have to restart civilization . A thousand people , that is a good round number . ( CHUCKLES ) This is our home . If we have to cut ourselves off from that future , in order to hold on to our own , then we`ll just have to survive out here with what we`ve got . We`ll survive . But first , let`s kick some ass . - SKYE : Hey , what are you doing ? - Hey . Why does it smell like Boylan`s in here ? lt`s liquid courage . l`ve had enough . No more bowing and scraping to that walking Oedipal complex . I got the terminus working . ( sighs ) Good . Now l`m going to blow it up . What ? ( STUTTERS ) I made a detonator . Mmm . I made it myself . Do you like it ? - lt`s got a red button . - Are you crazy ? They will kill you . Uh-huh . But it`s a noble death . At least l`ll die here in my lab . lt`s the only real home l ever had . Well , hey , okay . You don`t understand . Okay , we just got word from Shannon and Taylor . They do not want you to destroy it . ( sighs ) Thank God . Wait . Why not ? Well , we need it up and running , `cause they`re gonna use it to get to Hope Plaza and take it out . Whoa ! How ... I know ... I know l`m slightly inebriated but ... What ? Yeah , we`re cutting ourselves off from the future . But we need that terminus to do it . And I need coffee . Lots of coffee . Do you have any idea what a kilo of this stuff is worth in 2149 ? And we have three containers of it just sitting , gathering dust . Not for long . - The terminus is fixed ? - Malcolm Wallace just told me that ore will be in our employer`s hands before nightfall . ( CHUCKLES EX ClTEDLY ) And they are going to be happy to hear that . In fact , I might just take a little trip to 2149 , present it to them in person . Anything to get away from here , even for a couple hours . - Excuse me , sir . - Yeah . l`ll leave you two . To what do I owe the pleasure ? Well , l`ve been thinking a lot about what you said the other day . Mmm-hmm ? If you`re right , that your father`s never gonna forgive me for what I did , then why bother ? If my loyalty means nothing to him , maybe l`m being loyal to the wrong side . elisabeth : Why does it have to be you , Jim ? Because I know Hope Plaza better than anybody . Besides , l`ve broken into that place once before , remember ? Yeah , but that was so you could be with your family . This could take you away from us forever . Elisabeth , you said it yourself . If we don`t fight them , then everything we`ve sacrificed for , the life we want for our kids , will be taken away from us . l`m not going to let that happen . - How`s it coming ? - Good to go . - Let me show you how to arm this thing . - Okay . Now this one unlocks the triggering mechanism . - And this one starts the timer . - TAYLOR : Incoming ! ( GUNS charging ) RElLLY : lt`s okay , boys. lt`s one of ours . - That is disturbingly convincing . - We think so . TAYLOR : Reynolds , Dunham , gather up . - Reilly , you all set ? - Yes , sir . - Good . Your team , you set ? - Yes , sir . - How about you , Commander ? - Wasn`t easy , but we got the job done . We move out in five minutes . Doc . Kids . - Dad . - lt`s gonna be okay . I promise . l`m scared . Don`t be . l`m not gonna be gone long . Okay ? Good luck , Dad . ( soldier shouting ORDERS ) - LUCAS : All good ? - We`re all set to move out . - Whenever you`re ready . - Okay . Three is a crowd . - You heard the lady . - Sir . What ? What is it ? What if I told you I knew how to get in touch with your father ? Wait , what are you talking about ? You`re heading back to the colony , why ? LUCAS : I got some new information about my father ... ( static ) Say it again . l`m getting interference from the terminus . Something`s come up. l`ll explain later . Okay . What about the cargo you were bringing ? l`ll have someone else drive it out to you . Lucas , out . So , you`re really ready to do this ? - Lure my father into an ambush ? - Yeah , l`m ready . All right . For the ambush part , anyway . ( GUNS charging ) ( PLATE BUzzES ) Good to go . Good luck . All right , get this thing back to camp . We need as many vehicles as we can get . Will do . And just how do you think you`re going to get this thing started ? You don`t know the code . You know , l`d beat it out of you , but l`m afraid you might like that , dear brother . I guess l`ll just jack the starter . Remember that charge has got to be planted deep into the cooling matrix . I know exactly where to put it . Let`s just hope they didn`t do any remodeling . As soon as that cooling system blows , it`s gonna set off a chain reaction of a particle range . You gotta get the hell out of there as quick as you can . Got it . ( vehicle approaching ) ( GUNS charging ) MARK : All set to go , sir . Damn it , I should be the one doing this . We`ve been through this . You`ve got a family to take care of . What do I have ? A thousand people who came to Terra Nova on account of you . Now , whether we pull this off today or not , they need their commander . All right . Here . Take this , you might need it . l`m gonna want it back . ( CHUCKLES ) All right . All set here . Now , remember , inject it as close to the heart as possible . You sure it`s enough ? At this concentration , it would kill three men instantly . Listen , I know you`re worried . Tell the kids ... Stop , Jim , don`t . ( sighs ) Just , whatever you`re going to say can wait till you get back . Okay ? Because you will come back , won`t you , Jim ? Always . Shannon , it`s time . All set ? Almost , yeah . Just need another minute , sir . What`s the holdup ? All the damn thing has to do is sync up with Hope Plaza . Yeah , the Hope Plaza may provide the power to keep the fracture open , but reversing its natural time flow , it`s no small thing . Good to go . Uh ... - You may wanna ... - Yeah . ( POWERlNG UP ) All synced and ready to go . Huh ! I guess you`re not entirely incompetent after all . All right , we`re ready . is that the cargo from Lucas`s truck ? Here it is . Lucas said to tell you sorry if he held you up , but there was something important he had to do . Yeah , yeah , whatever . Hooper , scan this into the manifest . Let`s get moving . Hang on . Something`s not right here . Never mind . We`re good . Let`s get this cargo moving , people , 2149 awaits . ( electricity surging ) ( GRUNTS in frustration ) My father`s going to destroy the fracture , isn`t he ? He`s going to cut this place off from 2149 . And I was so close to beating him . SKYE : Hmm . - Taking it all away . - Yep . Well , you win some , you lose some . ( LOW CLATTER ) - ( GASPS ) - And I like to win . ( MAN shouting lNDlSTlNCTLY ) WEAVER : Right this way , gentlemen . l`m happy to report the first shipment from Terra Nova has arrived . We now have a two-way pipeline to the most plentiful world mankind has ever known . ( engine stalling ) ( dialing ) Hooper , you there ? This is Hooper , l`m not reading you . The interference is too strong . Contact ... ( static ) Plaza ... Not copying you , over . Hope Plaza is under attack . They need to power down and sever their link to the fracture . Otherwise , we could lose it for good . You have to ... ( static ) What`d you do ? What ? What`s happening ? ( sighs ) The induction coils are shorted . Your men must`ve damaged them when they moved it ! Can you fix it ? Atta boy , Malcolm . elisabeth : With the fracture untethered , where will Jim appear when he returns from Hope Plaza ? Well , he`s going to end up someplace else when he comes back through . But , don`t worry , it`ll be within three clicks of right here . l`m going to need to go back to the colony and get replacements . Well , hurry up then . Meteoric iron , gentlemen . Back there you can`t spit without hitting the stuff . Three containers . Each one holds 30 metric tons . ( WEAVER CHUCKLES ) Gentlemen , today you`re rich . Tomorrow , well , it`s just going to be stupid . What about the other matter we asked you to look into ? The Badlands . Yeah , we sent some people out that way . GRANGER : And , did you find anything ? As a matter of fact , we did . ( PLATE scanning ) Why don`t you see for yourselves ? ( LOW GROWL ) ( SCREECHlNG ) ( GROANS ) GRANGER : is it coming this way ? What do we do now ? - lt`s all clear . Go . - Okay . - ( CARNOTAUR GROWLS ) - ( GRANGER SCREAMS ) Help , security ! We got a problem ! A big problem ! Move ! Move ! ( radio BLEEPS ) SKYE : Commander Taylor , come in . lt`s Taylor . Go ahead , Skye . lt`s Lucas , sir . He got away . - Where is he now ? - My guess is he`s headed your way , - towards the terminus . He`s on foot . - Copy that . l`m on it . Out . ( GROANS ) Hello , Son . Where you heading in such a hurry ? I think that we both know the answer to that . ( groaning ) You drew blood . I didn`t think you had it in you . Think again ! Go , go , go ! ( GRUNTlNG ) ( BEEPlNG ) ( soldier SHOUTS ) ( SPlTS ) For the first time , l`m glad your mother`s dead . - Don`t . - She would be so - ashamed of what you`ve become . - Don`t say that . lt`s true , boy . You know it`s true . It wasn`t my fault she died . - lt`s not my fault . - Your fault she ... Of course it wasn`t . My God. ls that what you think ? Help me , Dad . Just forgive me . Please . lt`s not that simple . Look , you`ve got to answer for what you`ve done . We all do . Oh , Dad. l`m so sorry. l`m so sorry . ( sobbing ) You`re still my son . - You`re still my boy . - ( GASPS ) You arrogant fool . Do you think I care about your forgiveness ? lt`s you who should be begging me for mine ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( GUNSHOT ) ( breathing heavily ) Oh , God ! Don`t move. lt`s bad . Lucas . l`m sorry . ( ALARM blaring ) Uh-uh , uh-uh . What the hell did you do ! Weaver . You stupid son of a bitch ! Do you have any idea what you`ve cost us ? ( CARNOTAUR growling ) ( screaming ) ( SCREECHlNG ) ( soldier shouting ) ( CARNOTAUR growling ) Think you can get to your feet ? ( SKYE GRUNTlNG ) SKYE : Oh , my God . He`s gone . soldier : Still no sign of him . The fracture reopened near here . ( soldiers talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) He`s got to be close . Come on , Jim . jim : Elisabeth . I told you l`d be back . mira : What happened ? Hope Plaza. lt`s gone . - They blew it to pieces . - What are you talking about ? We`re stuck here , forever . Well , maybe it`s just me , but knowing we`re cut off from the future makes this jungle seem a whole lot bigger somehow . Excuse me , Commander . - Dunham ? - Just got a transmission from the colony . - lt`s Boylan . - Boylan ? Boylan ? This is Taylor . Hello , Commander . Good to hear your voice again . You`re taking a hell of a risk , aren`t you ? Contacting me on an unsecured frequency . There`s no one listening . In fact , there`s no one here . All those big-spending new customers of mine , they`re all gone . What`s that now ? Phoenix picked up their operation and rolled out about 15 minutes ago . The whole lot of them . Okay . Thanks for the heads up . - We`ll be waiting . - Oh , no . Not to worry . They`re not coming your way . They`ve headed north . - North ? - Don`t ask me why . All I know is l`ve got an empty bar that needs filling . So , hurry home , would you ? ( radio BEEPS ) ( PEOPLE applauding ) ( CROWD whooping ) - Welcome back , Commander . - We`re home . ( ALL talking lNDlSTlNCTLY ) lt`s good to see you , too . lt`s good to see you up here , where you belong . lt`s good to be home . Those bastards left a lot of scars . Yeah . Nothing we can`t fix . - How are you holding up ? - Ah ! l`m all right , almost . - Thank you . - Thank you . Shannon , it was a hell of a thing you pulled off back in Hope Plaza . Makes me kind of glad I didn`t run your ass out the gates the day you broke into my colony . - Commander . - Reynolds . One of our RB`s on the northern perimeter just spotted the Phoenix convoy . - A dozen vehicles , at least a hundred men . - Which way are they heading ? We lost track of them after they passed Marker 33 . Looked like they were heading toward the Badlands . Badlands ? Why the hell would they go there ? There`s nothing out there . - l wish I could tell you , sir . - jim : The Badlands . Weaver shipped something he found out there back to Hope Plaza . Well , at least he was going to , anyway , if we hadn`t switched out the containers . - l overheard them talking about it . - Did he say what it was ? Not before he got a face-full of carno . Let`s track down that container . Let`s get it out of there . See what it is ? What is it ? It looks like a statue . lt`s not a statue . - lt`s the prow of a ship . - lt`s old . Eighteenth century , from the looks of it . How the hell did a ship from any century end up in the Badlands ? How`d it even end up in this time period ? Well , it didn`t come through Hope Plaza , that`s for sure . However it got here , kind of makes you wonder , what else is out in the Badlands waiting for us . What bothers me is why Phoenix headed out there the minute they realized they were cut off from 2149 . jim : Taylor wants to keep this under wraps until we know more , - and I think that`s the right way to go . - elisabeth : Yeah , that`s fine by me . To be honest with you , I don`t even want to think about what it all might mean right now . l`m just really glad we`re safe . - Me , too . - Yeah . What are they looking at ? Hey , what are you looking at ? Maddy claims there`s a meteor shower tonight . Nothing so far , though . Maybe I got my calculations wrong . zoe , you want to go inside and help me run them again ? - The kid`s been through enough . - Wait . One`s coming . I know . - Come on . Come on . - Okay . Told you ! Wow , you called it , zoe . English - US - SDH

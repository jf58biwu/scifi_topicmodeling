 I never thought I would see you again . I wanted to reach out so much , but I was afraid that I 'd jeopardize your safety . We need your help , Nina . - Give Dr. Bishop anything he wants . - Oh , it would be an honor . Who is that ? - It was a case that we worked on . He started to exhibit empathic abilities . Why would I need an empath ? We used this place to hide him until someone could return for him . There it is . He 's not here . I think whoever took the boy left this behind . It 's picking up a signal . - It 's where the signal originates . What do you want ? He definitely doesn 't have the tech . Maybe it was removed . - No , there 's no scar tissue . Here . Try this . Go on . It 's good . Michael , you used to write things down for me . You helped us catch a bad man . Do you remember that ? Michael , you 're very special and there 's a lot that we would like to learn about you . My father was working on a plan with a man named Donald . You were a very important part of that plan . Do you remember that ? You do and you know me . We should go into his mind like we did with September . September was in a coma . - Put him in one too . - We 're not putting him in a coma . Then we put an electromagnetic probe into the base of his skull and ply him full of serotonin , neurontin and LSD . Walter , he is just a child . - He is not just a child ! He is more than a child . He is an integral part of my plan . He must know that . He 's not saying anything for some reason . You said yourself , he wrote things before . Why is he not doing that now ? Who is Donald ? Where is he ? Is he alive ? I must find him . Tell me . - Hey , Walter , calm down . - How can I calm down ? We 're running out of time . Don 't you understand we 've got a world to save ? Acid , get back to cutting out those tapes . We won 't get any answers out of him . Peter , it doesn 't make any sense . He 's an empath . We used to have a connection . He used to feel what I wanted and then he 'd communicate it to me . Now it just seems like he can 't . This is Nina Sharp . Nina , it 's Olivia . - Is everything all right ? - Nina , we need your help with something . What , a- - ? It 's not safe to talk here . Let me call you in 10 minutes . Can I help you ? You are a Loyalist . Then you know how important it is that you answer my questions . Where is your superior ? I 'm not sure . She got a call a little while ago and then told me she was taking an early lunch . - Who was the call from ? - It came in on her private comm . - When did this occur ? - About 20 minutes ago . Bring an LQ7 unit . We don 't have much time . When is she expected to return ? She 's always back by 1 : 00 . Fugitives we are seeking recently used a sublimation device to access an abandoned storage facility . We have traced the device to the Ministry of Science . Someone here has supplied them with it . I suspect from this office . It is not you I am concerned with . This is Nina Sharp . Is everything all right ? We 've never seen one before . A child Observer ? A child Observer ? We 've never seen one before . It 's not safe for me to talk here . Let me call you in 10 minutes . Nina , thank you so much for doing this . I know the risk you 're taking . No , nonsense . I 'm nothing if I can 't be a resource for you . Now , where is he ? Hello . My name is Nina . What are we doing here ? I 'm cold . I have access to tech that will be helpful for you to communicate with him . It 's in a lab , not far from here . - A Ministry lab ? You think that 's safe ? - Not a Ministry lab . A Black Lab . I thought Massive Dynamic Black Labs didn 't exist . I 'm glad I can still surprise you . Since the invasion , I 've allowed it to be used by the resistance . We should get going . How 's Walter doing ? - Which one ? - Ah . - He 's vacillating lately . And he dropped acid yesterday , so that didn 't exactly help . Ha , ha . Wow . He hasn 't changed that much . He catches me off guard . I look him in the eyes sometimes and I see a stare that I don 't recognize . He told me you agreed to remove the pieces of his brain once he completed the plan . Never underestimate the power of incentive . You don 't approve ? What happens to him ? After the tissue has been removed , what happens to Walter ? How many times can a human brain endure that ? Walter told me that that was a risk that he was willing to take . - I don 't accept that . - You may not have to . If the plan isn 't completed in time , he may regress and no longer want to go through with it . So you 're saying I lose him either way . What I 'm saying is your father understands anything worth fighting for comes with a cost . Perhaps she has been alerted to our presence here . It would not be the first time . Every conspiracy has a network . I want to see the facility from which the sublimation device was taken . It 's okay . It 's better if he stays back there for a moment . The resistance experimented on Observers here ? Yes . Among other things , we wanted to understand how they were reading us . Create technology that would give us the same advantage . Did it work ? No . We were only able to extract bits and pieces of data . Images , words in their conscious minds , but not enough to be useful . However , if you were able to communicate with the Observer child using neural stimulation once before this technology might be able to help you do it again . You all right ? You 're thinking about her . Yeah , every time I see one of those posters my heart jumps . Yeah , mine too . It 's hard to see her face , but at the same time , I want to . You ready in there ? Yeah . Yeah , it 's all good . Like ours ... Observer brains translate external stimuli- - Language , sights , sounds . - -Into patterns of electrical activity , which we commonly call thoughts . Come on , Michael . This is an electrocognitive translator , an ECoG for shod . How does it work ? By interpreting patterns of electrical activity into words and images that we can understand . - Allowing you to read their thoughts . - For all intents and purposes , yes . This will suffice . Prep the subject . His name 's Michael . Captain Windmark , we 're not able to locate Nina Sharp 's comm device . Continue looking . Mr. Roe . We have determined that Nina Sharp is a traitor . She is working for the resistance . Do you have any knowledge of that ? No . Do you know where she is ? No . I believe you . This is going to be a little cold . We 're just gonna do a test , but it won 't hurt . I promise . - His cortical activity is off the charts . - The neural link is good . We 're ready . Okay . Michael , if at any point you want to stop , you just squeeze my hand . Okay ? Michael , do you remember why you 're so important to Walter 's plan ? His mind is responding to the question . Hmm . The ECoG is attempting to translate his neural activity . But he 's processing information in a way I 've never seen before . This is not like any of the other Observers from our trials . The software can 't interpret it . Something has fundamentally changed with the subject . Michael . Whatever allowed us to communicate before is no longer viable . You said the boy formed a bond with Olivia , helped her solve a case once . That 's right . So he did so because he knew what you wanted . He could feel it through the empathic connection with you . Maybe he can 't help us now because that connection no longer exists . So you 're saying he can 't understand what we want . So how can he help us ? We 've been trying to get into his mind maybe the answer is letting him get into ours . Yes . That is brilliant , Nina . We need to create a link between one of our conscious minds and the boy 's . - How do we do that ? - It 's going to take some time . I have to reconfigure the ECoG software . You 've got to return to the warehouse at the Ministry of Science to get another ECoG halo and a neural adaptor for the second person . - Is that a problem ? - No , I 've got a man in Archives . - He 'll give us what we want . - Hastings ? Yes . Next . Name . Hastings , Darryl R. I still can 't get through to Hastings . This is intolerable . Without the adaptor to the second ECoG halo we have no way to communicate with the boy . - Don 't worry , Walter . We 'll get it . - Nina will have the passcode . Well , her comm doesn 't work underground , so there 's no way to contact her . Do you think that we can bypass this ? - Hey , guys . - Astrid . - I need help breaking through a security lock . - I 'm on it . Give me the model number . Next . I 'm a quality assurance engineer . I assess and maintain the technology warehoused in this facility . I don 't report directly to Nina Sharp but indirectly sometimes I do . Mr. Hastings , we believe- - Doctor . It 's Dr. Hastings . Dr. Hastings . Okay , you 're gonna want to take the brown wire from the pad and attach it to the comm 's receiving node . All right , comm is attached . Now I 'm going to send a continuous stream of data to your comm device . Hopefully it 'll short out the locking circuitry . Hopefully ? I thought she knew what she was doing . Okay , I 'm sending it now . You might want to step back . Okay , we 're in . We believe a sublimation device from this facility was provided to known fugitives . Are you aware of this ? No . I do not believe you . Restrain him . Dismiss the rest . We may as well be looking for a needle in a haystack . It 's all arranged according to serial number . Look . There 's a terminal . Maybe we can access the database . - Can you run a search ? - Yeah . There . 18-C-6 . Up there , on the top shelf . Windmark 's here . - What ? - He 's with Hastings . It was an outdated model . I didn 't know what they were using it for . You wanted to help them . You admire them . You admire Dr. Bishop . Yes . I admire him . Where is Nina Sharp now ? I swear , I don 't know . Where are the fugitives ? Your loyalty will be rewarded . I don 't know . I don 't know . Michael , I need you to stay here . I 'll be right back . There , that 's her signal . - Components are intact . - We gotta get out of here now . - It 's Nina . - Olivia , is everything all right ? Nina , I need you to listen to me . - You 've been compromised . - What ? The Observers and Windmark are here . They 're interrogating Hastings now . You can 't come back to the Ministry and you can 't go home . It 's okay . I have to go now . I 'm sorry . - Okay , we 're ready . Let 's go . - Wait . They 're gone . A guard just came in and told Windmark something and then they left . - We 're going to make an example out of you . - My thoughts exactly . Dr. Hastings , can you hear me ? I tried . I tried . - It 's okay . - He knows . What ? What does Windmark know ? Nina . They tracked her . They know where she is . It 's okay . Everything 's gonna be fine . I 'm just ... It doesn 't matter . There 's nothing for you to worry about . Oh , my God . Michael . Come with me . Quickly . What 's wrong ? Why are we stopping ? Checkpoint . - We need to turn around . If I turn around , we 'll draw too much attention . We need to ditch the car . One at a time . Walter , you first . Get out now . Okay . Go . Find them . Captain Windmark . The fugitives . Where are they ? You 're too late . They 're long gone . You are trying to protect them . What is it about the fugitives , I wonder that instills such misguided loyalty ? You are trying to block your thoughts from me . But it will not last . You animals . You are thinking of him . The boy . This morning you were contacted in your office . You said something about a child Observer . He is important to the fugitives . Why is he important to them ? What is his purpose ? Why does a child worry you so much ? He is merely a curiosity . And you are mistaken about him . He is no child . He is a chromosomal mistake . A genetic anomaly . Progeny XB-6783746 . Like all anomalies , he was scheduled to be destroyed . But he went missing . It was a great mystery in my time . No one knew what became of him . Until now . I would very much like to meet him . Tell me where he is . Captain Windmark , there 's no sign of anyone else here . Then I will have to resort to a deeper extraction . Why ? Why ? Why are you not frightened ? Do you know why you tilt your head in that way ? It 's an involuntary reflex in your physiology . It changes the angle at which sound waves hit the eardrum allowing in more stimuli . Like a lizard . I 've studied them too . Intriguing characters . Their brains have evolved over 320 million years . Yet , for all their evolution , they form no bonds . Love does not exist for them . They are incapable of dreaming of contemplating beauty of knowing something greater than themselves . Not unlike your kind . The experiments we conducted right here in this lab yielded a surprising result . Because for all your years of evolution you inadvertently redeveloped and honed primitive instincts that we moved beyond long ago . So in reality , you 're the animal . Restrain her . You cannot hurt me with that . I know . Walter , maybe you should stay in the van . I 'm coming with you . Nina ? They 've got the boy . Who knows what they 'll do to him ? What did he do to her ? Where 's she going ? She stopped Windmark from reading her . To protect us . To protect the plan . And to protect the boy . They left without him . He 's still here . Michael . Michael ? Michael , you can come out now . It 's safe . Michael ! Michael . Michael . Peter ! You all right ? It 's okay . Michael . He 's crying . - You ready ? - Yeah . If you understand me , touch your nose . Good . That 's very good . Do you remember meeting me , a long time ago with a man named Donald ? He does . He remembers . Do you know why I needed you for my plan ? Can you tell me why you 're important ? The boy is important . He has to live . What happened ? I know who Donald is . Donald is September .

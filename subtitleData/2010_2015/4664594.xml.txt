 Translation from Spanish by jcdr v1.0 - 18.09.2012 The following movie is a compilation of more than 100 hours of high definition footage , captured by the British Society of Cryptozoology . No images have been altered or manipulated in any way . THE DINOSAURS PROJECT Fear grows , after the disappearance of a group of explorers from the British Society of Cryptozoology . The biggest concern is that they have been attacked by a jungle militia . Although it is still unknown why the helicopter , after a three weeks journey , has lost radio contact . More news to follow . You 've heard of the Loch-Ness monster , and of the legendary North-American Big Foot . Now , meet Mokele Mbembe , the African mythical monster . An ancient creature , who has been making headlines despite ... Literally , " River Blocker " . Some scientists believe that it fits with the description of a Plesiosaur , a prehistoric marine reptile that died along with the rest of the Dinosaurs . Although many do not believe it is something scientific ... It was originally reported by missionaries over 100 years ago . There has been some sightings of the legendary beast for years , because of the extensive deforestation , which allows the light to enter in what was once an impenetrable jungle . Despite claims of fraud , the news of sightings are on the rise , so the Society of Cryptozoology has formed a group of expeditioners in the Congolese Jungle , to investigate the source of the rumors . As project leader , we have the internationally renowned explorer and zoologist Jonathan Marchant . He was at the head of a group in 2010 , in charge of tracking the elusive Tasmanian Tiger . On December 23 , 1938 , a South African fisherman , Henry Gooznan , saw a Coelacanth , believed extinct for 65 million years . We , scientists , must have an open mind . We cannot affirm or deny anything without accurate information . If there is something out there , it is my job to find and observe it . This is not only because of the thrill of the hunt . Sorry . The Society , which has been founded in the Victorian time , looking for animals whose existence was not yet proven , did not have many successes . If there are any shy Dinosaurs hanging around , they should seek shelter now , because the group will be accompanied by a TV team With recording devices of the latest generation . Care with T-Rex . Be careful , because there will be times that we did not hope . I think this is the camera . Okay , well . This is the video diary of the great Jonathan Marchant . Hunter of mythical creatures and action adventurer . There are Dinosaurs , in all parts . Beware , because Dad walks with ... Panties . Many . I 'd say there are about 15 . 15 pairs of these beautiful panties . I do not like them much . They are for English souls . They are panties , which tell the Dinausaurs , do not mess with my Dad . Lovely . Of course , the famous hat . As always . Let 's go ! This is better . A satellite video phone . Cannot be . This is the worst possible time . Why can 't you take care of you , if it 's also your responsibility ? I cannot change my plans , right ? Okay . Okay , yeah . All right . What is this ? So what are you playing at ? Some of these things belong to the television company . I am going with you ? Thanks to your mom , yes . But you 'll be in the enclosure , Rachel can take care of you . Why did they expel you , Luke ? The manager was controller of the orders . He deserved it . You put it on the Internet . OUTPUTS - Liz . - Hello . Hi , how are you ? Hi . Nice to see you . - Are you ready ? - Yes . The camera is my son 's . I 'm Liz Draper , I finished ... I finished my Medicine studies last year . And I was looking for a different challenge . And this , it was definitely different . What will you do in the Dinosaurs project ? Well . I 'll see to take good care of those ... who were stung by a snake or a scorpion . This is enough , thanks . Luke . - Something 's wrong ? - No . The red light is on . Is it ? - Sorry Sir . What do you want ? - Pretzels , please . Luke , stop . ARRIVALS Pete , how do you find local food ? - Hey , Pete ? - Yes . Would you like to eat , and I 'll help with your luggage ? - Definitely . - Very well ! - For you . - For me . Do not touch the camera . You know the rules . I 'm sorry . Sorry ? You are not there to strive . - What do you think , Dad ? - Very cute . How do you see this ? He will not come , Luke . But I can be your camera operator or your engineer . Think about it . I have mini cameras . They are great ! They fit in anywhere . And they send the images to your hard drive , while you take them . I have many . Always being recording . They film everything , it 's great . Surely a TV company . Have that resolved . But it would surprise me if they had this technology , because it is very modern . - They are as good as those of the TV . - You 're not coming , right ? - You would never let me go . - I have everything ready . Make sure you 're ready , because your aunt comes to pick you up at 4 : 00 PM . Okay . I hope your Aunt Rachel is here soon . See you in a couple of weeks . Do not do anything stupid . Okay . Goodbye Daddy . Hello . Nice to meet you . Sound is ready ? Could you introduce yourself , please ? My name is Omara . And this is Ethien , our pilot . Ethien and I worked for the Environment Agency in Congo . So we are both passionate about conservatism . I 'm sorry . - We do it again ? - Of course . Prehistoric monsters ! I 'm not sure about that . My job is to ensure that the team reaches the jungle safely . And to make sure they do not harm the forest habitat . I 'm Charlie Rutherford . I 've been with Jonathan , in all expeditions . I guess I can say ... that I 'm his right hand . To be honest . We do everything together . I have always been there with Jonathan , along with the discoveries we have made . I have always been there . Things are as they are . I organize sponsorship and Jonathan is the public figure . He definitely prefers the opposite , but that 's what you get , being the best at what you do . Let 's do this . All set . Excited ? Here we go . Heavens ! This is absolutely amazing . This is a Plesiosaur . This is an Ichthyosaur . Both sure lived in deep waters , in rivers 300 feet deep or more . And together the are consistently found in fossils . Yes it is a Plesiosaur ... It 's like a furry cat . There is nothing to worry about . But his cousin ... Is evil . There is a wide range of possibilities , that Mokele is a distant descendant of one of these animals . And it is just a myth , of course . You don 't think it 's possible ? It is the African monster of Loch Ness . But much more plausible . It stinks in here . Smells like petrol . Or feet . First time I 'm in a helicopter and I 'm in the cupboard . This is great . Now I 've been flying ... Well ... Like 90 minutes ? I don 't know how much longer ... What was that ? You put yourself and others at risk , don 't you see ? What if the helicopter gets in troubles ? You 're not even tied in ! If the helicopter falls , we all die . That 's not the point . I knew this would be a problem . We must return there , to take him back . I can 't . We passed the limit , not enough fuel . - What shall I do with you ? - Calm down , Jonathan . He wanted to come on the expedition . You can 't blame him , right ? Okay , when we land , you get off . Meanwhile you sit there and do not touch anything . Luke . Sit . Omara , what 's that down there ? It is a traditional village , Wootie town . What are they ? Charlie , who are they ? Not sure . They look strange . They don 't fly like birds . Omara , what kind of birds are those ? Omara ? Ethien ! Captain ! Beware ! We fall . Seriously , we fall . We hit an animal . Luke . Luke . - Johnny , are you okay ? - Yes . Take the bags and leave . Take the bags and leave . Ethien . Luke , get out . There 's fuel leaking . Luke , get out ! Get out ! Charlie , help me with the equipment . Pete , get him out of here . He got caught . Take cover , everyone . Move . Charlie . Wait , my equipment . The hard drives . Luke , no ! Luke , leave them . Luke , let 's go . Sal , let 's go . Luke , move . Let 's go . Luke , beware ! Let 's go . Let 's go , Luke . No . Oh my God ! Oh my God ! Oh my God ! You will start listening to me , understand ? I need these cameras . Do not put ... Do not put anyone 's life in danger in this crew , including you . Is that clear ? Someone just died there . Turn that thing off ! What the hell were those things ? They definitely did not seem like birds . They were jungle hawks , with 15 meters wings . Planes always crash over here . OK ? Okay . We have to seek refuge in this village . Omara , which way ? We cross the river . Did you hear that ? What is it ? I 've seen something . Let 's go . I will not lose anyone else tonight . Right , Your Majesty . What happened here ? No ! It 's not possible . What happens ? Nothing . Nothing . Everything 's OK . Everything 's OK . The sun will set in less than an hour , we should go . Give me a light . Don 't look . Okay , Dad . - What was that ? - Some tribal cult . Omara , what do you think ? I don 't think we should stay here . The weather is getting bad . We 'll have to find another hut . This looks good . We can stay here . Well , I have no choice . - What is it ? - Ii is a motion detector . - Pete , ready ? - Yes . Re-lighting . How thoughtful ! It will film when it feels some movement . Good thinking ! - Luke , stop that . - One moment . This is getting dark . Leave it . If there 's anybody out there , don 't you think it would be good to know that they are here ? A smart kid . Not so bad . There is a lot of food . Most of it , thanks to Pete . We can go to the crash site in the morning , but if we spend a few days here , we can hunt . They will pick us up before , right ? We don 't know if Ethien has sent an alarm signal or not . The radio shut off before the impact . What about the other cameras ? - And does the satellite phone work ? - No . I think it was ruined in the accident . Why not give it to Luke ? He knows more about these things than any of us . I will do my best . Although I don 't guarantee anything . Okay , then ... I think we can count some days , before they rescue us ... or we get to safe harbor . Try to sleep . I don 't think anyone can sleep with this noise . Pete , by the way ... if you throw any other flatulence , I 'll kick you outside . Pete . Pete ? Now what did I do ? Listen . What the hell is that ? Luke . Luke . Heaven . Hold a light . See . See . Get out . Run ! Run ! Get out . Everybody out . We 're leaving . Come on , move . We have to reach the river . - Get up . - I 'm fine . Let 's go . The boat ! The boat . Get on . Get on . Wait , Dad . Where is Dad ? Dad ! Hurry ! Run . Let 's go ! Move ! Where is Liz ? Jonathan , where is Liz ? Killed . What ? Now we are adrift . Dad the captain thought , which is the best way to rescue us . This is the best chance we have . We need to seek shelter . If we meet someone , it will be right here . Last night we were attacked , in an abandoned village . Liz ... Liz ... she 's gone . Charlie recognized what hit us . May be , some kind of dinosaur . Omara ... says he has never seen anything like this before . I guess the mission is finished . We 're stranded here . Charlie has been talking to me . There 's more , of what the others have done . Like Dad . That will be all . Liz , rest in peace . Okay . Sure . Did you progress with that ? I had no idea that ... you would bring that sort of things . Expeditions can take a long time . True . Did you know that you are very popular in Japan ? There are many fun websites . How do you think I knew what you did ? What happens ? Did you see that ? What ? What was that ? In the trees . - Don 't you see ? - Where ? They are everywhere . Leaves , Pete . That 's what they are . It 's nothing . There ! There ! Oh my God , yes ! See , I told you . They are tracking us . It could be anything . What the hell was that ? There 's something in there ! Wait . Wait . Pete , there are rocks . Beware ! Broke the pot . Devils ! Keep your head down . Can you tell us what 's going on ? We lost one of the boats and they are repairing the hole . Can you describe what you saw in the water ? What ? - What was out there . - Out there , there 's nothing ! How long will we stay on this island ? We hope to leave in the morning . - I 'm finished . - Jonathan ... Are we safe here ? You really bought cards with images of dinosaurs ? It seems that was your mom . We 've eaten worse . In fact ... - What was that ? - That was big . Maybe a leopard . - Just hunting . - This is what happens in the Jungle . We 're safe here on the island . I can ask you something ? I 'm as scared as you are ... What do you think are these things ? I 'm not sure . I never heard that the attacked like this before . What did you hear exactly ? For years , there have been stories of attacks . Sightings of strange animals . Local leaders believe this is because of the program of local deforestation . They believe that the demons fled farther and farther from their homes . Their home ? Obobo means Door . This is folklore . It 's just a myth . A Door . What is there on the other side ? A lot of the village men have gone to find out . None has returned . Not one . - It was not supposed to come here . - What do you mean ? What was that ? Dave , if you miss a round ... Heaven ! What 's that ? It 's impossible . Look , there are more of them . What are they ? Dilophosaurs . - You are sure . - No , I 'm assuming . What the hell is this ? Do you like sweet ? What are you doing ? Come here . Do not be stupid Luke , you 'll lose a finger . Listen , we don 't know how they react . Come . Good boy ! Come . Luke . That cute ! Look at him . Luke . Cheers ! Stinks . Doesn 't smell good . We gotta go . Now . Those who saw last night , were babies . What if the babies come with others which are not so friendly ? You said last night that they were not supposed to come here . Isn 't it obvious ? Don 't you remember the village over there ? We are not safe here . Jonathan ... We gotta go . Now ! It is not safe anymore to be on the island . I think , they 're just playing , basically . Look . But the best is this . I call it Crypto . I think he likes me . Let 's go Crypto . Good boy . Come . Come . Good . We will discover why they disappeared last night . How ? They will ask . With this . Give me the camera ! Right . There . It 's me . That will not hurt , right ? Good boy . Excellent work . Pete , come and see this ! See . Watch this . Omara . Where are you going ? I will not look at this . - How far is that ? - About 2 miles . We put a camera on the Dinosaur . What will they do ? They jump out of the water . They 're fast . How come ? They 're 65 million years old . What is it ? It is a totem . A tribal warning . Damn , what happened ? I believe the camera must have lost the transmission . Come on , didn 't you say this was working ? Calm down Charlie . I 'm sorry ! They went downstream . They can 't be that far away . True . This cave must be East from here . We could easily get there in the boat . That will not happen . I 'm packing . We 're going ! What ? What the hell ? ... When will you listen to me ? We 're not safe here . She 's right , Charlie . We have no idea of the ground below the cave . We will follow the plan , we go down the river , meet other people . Arrange the boat , we go back and do it properly . Do you have any idea how big this is ? There are Dinosaurs there . More than the ones we saw . Evolutionary mutations , the ones anyone would dream about ! I want this as much as you want ... So you 'll let someone else get the glory ? Glory . I already lost two people on this trip . I have to take care of a child of 15 years . A rookie to whom I have to teach everything . Is that why you don 't take me ? Because I 'm not good enough to go with you ? Daddy , why do you always do this ? I did not ask you to put a camera in one of those animals . Maybe you 're jealous , because the rookie is exploring ... instead of giving orders to the others . - Get out ! - Luke , it is very dangerous ! Okay . I understand . Luke , I think you 're right . Stay out of this . It works again . They seem to know where they 're going . They follow a trail . Yes , a game trail . They must use it a lot . See that , right ? There are more of them . This is the Door . - I have to tell Dad . - No , no , no ! What do you think your Dad will do , if we tell him ? He will start to sermon us , to dissuade us . Why not leave it ' til a better time ? For when we return to the base . If you say this at the right time ... you 'll have a place back in the team , guaranteed . OK ? Only you care , buddy . White water up ahead . It will a bit bumpy . Hold on . Let 's keep the boat straight . Charlie , take care of the stern . Keep pulling . - Keep pulling . - I 'm pulling . We should go to the left . Water is coming in . Jonathan , secure the other boat ! Luke ! Luke ! Dad ! Hang on and keep the head down . Charlie ! Down ! What are you doing ? Heaven . We must go back . Jonathan , we will not manage . Maybe we should go back to the rescue team . With a helicopter . I won 't leave you here . Let 's go ! Where are we ? The water is cold . Is that bad ? It means it is deep , very deep . These dinosaurs must have taken a shortcut . We should follow . We have to use our hands to paddle . Luke ! Dad . Dad , we 're here ! Stay there . We come to you , Luke . Yes , Pete , take this . You came back . Heaven . Sit down . What happened ? The rope must have been damaged . It is a clean cut . How 's going the fix of the satellite phone ? I have to fix a couple of connections and I think it will work . Okay . Okay . We need to find land . Let 's paddle . Paddle . Paddle . Come . Come . There 's something beneath us . Sit down . There . Oh dear ! This is Mokele Mbembe . It 's not aggressive . Remain calm . Let me pass . Care , Dave . You sure this is not the bad kind ? Easy , guy . Dave , look out ! Dave ! Get in the boat . Dad ! Daddy , help me ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! Dad ! You have to get away from here . We are not safe . Dad ! Dad ! He 's gone . All dead . Everyone is dead . Caution . Where do we go ? You have to make this work , right ? Charlie ! Charlie , wait ! - Charlie , I can not follow your steps ! - You have to keep moving . How 's it going with the satellite phone ? Okay . Okay . Let 's go . Let 's go . Fixed it . Charlie ? Charlie ! I found it . Let 's go . Let 's go . Charlie ! - Charlie ! - Let 's go . Charlie ! I ... - I fixed the phone . - Great ! It 's fantastic . Good job , buddy . Charlie ! I don 't know whether this is the high price I have to pay . I think I went through the entrance . I went through a hole in the ground . Some kind of cave . Charlie ... Charlie pushed me ... and tried to kill me . Please ... Please , I don 't know if there was anyone out there . Is there anybody there ? The sound still works , Dave . Luke ! Luke ! Luke , we 're here . Jonathan , he is dead . You don 't know . Believe me , where they went , they will no come back . Did you see it ? It 's with Charlie . Where , Omara ? At the door . It 's In upland . I can track them . No , it was not supposed to come here . You knew this place . You should never have come here . I had to take you to a part of safe jungle for you to film ... and then hop on a plane home . It was supposed to be easy . You under-estimated this jungle , we all did . Will you come back ? I will not risk going in a place , where we have no right to be . Sorry Jonathan . I regret all what happened . Sorry about Luke . But now you 're on your own . Pete ? I 'll go with you Jonathan . You 'll get help . Let 's go Pete . Let 's find my son . Dad ... If you are still there ... I 'm sorry . I wouldn 't be here anymore , if not for you . I just wanted to say that I 'm glad that we came together on this trip . Things never end as supposed . So thanks . Crypto . I 'm glad to see you ! Hello boy . What happens ? No , no . No , no , no . No . No , no . Please . I love animals . Luke ! - Dad ! - I thought I 'd lost you . - They won 't get away with it . - Pete . Get out . - This is for Dave . - Pete ! Let 's go vermins ! Come here . Dave , see how they run ... Where are they ? Come . Okay . Keep moving Luke . Keep on . Follow Luke . - Dad , stop . - Are you okay ? I found the entrance . Charlie , it has always been like this . He tried to kill me . Charlie . He went crazy . He took the satellite phone . And pushed me in the cavern . He tried to kill me . Charlie . The boats went down . - Let 's go . - Where do we go ? We have to find the phone . I 've been traveling a path that is not registered on any map . I think this valley is full of Dinosaurs . Creatures which we thought extinct 65 million years ago . Although there has been no sightings , but anything can happen . Right now I want the world to know , that the first sighting of these animals is dedicated to you , Luke . Rest in peace . Ii is a promise buddy . Okay . I will continue ... Stay there . - Got it ? - Yes . - Need Help ? - No , I 'm fine . Definitely came through here . Damn . Go ! It is incredible . I lost. it - I can 't see its trail . - Maybe we 'll find it . Maybe . We 're going up . - What was that ? - Wait . Dad ! Dad ! Luke . Don 't be stupid . Leave . - I found something . - Leave . Dad , this is Charlie . You have to climb . Luke ... - If I can 't , get out of here . - No , I will not leave you here . Listen ... Go ! Let 's go . - I won 't let you go . - Luke ... Stay away from him . Run ! No , no . I love you . Do not forget . No ! Luke . Luke . Luke . Luke . Let 's settle this . We can do this together , right buddy ? I have the satellite telephone . Crypto . You go out and call for help , right ? Crypto . Luke . I can hear you . Come on , seriously . Where do you think you 're going ? Luke . Okay buddy . Let 's go . Let 's go . It 's your camera . This is your home . No ! No ! No , please ! You think you can get away from me ? I am a professional , Luke . In fact , now that your Dad is no longer ... I think I 'm the best in the world in this . No ! Get away from me ! Get away from me ! Look . I don 't want to do this , really . But if you leave me the credit for this place , then you , you cannot walk around anymore . I 'm sorry . Seriously . That 's not very friendly , right ? Yes it is . It is friendly , it protected me . But you 're not ! I 'm Luke Marchant . This will be my last journal entry . I have the recordings from the cameras , which could be useful . The satellite phone broke again . I don 't know if I can fix it . I came up with a backup plan . My message in a bottle . A while ago I was walking in the Valley . Dark soon , so I have to ... find shelter . But first ... I want to show you something . You may never have seen anything like it . Ready ? Well Dad ... I guess you would have loved being here . I 'll try to get to the center of the valley , while there 's still light . I 'm not sure what I will find , I 'll have to see . But I think I have a guide . This is it . Now I leave . Maybe I see you around . A new twist has occurred in the mystery surrounding the British expedition in the Congo . A rescue team found the belongings , of one of the team members . It was found floating in one of the rivers of the waterfall , flowing through the heart of the dense jungle of Northern Congo . Inside the backpack , there were video hard drives , carefully wrapped in waterproof bags . Local police expected the videos to clarify what happened . And the rescue team left immediately . More news to follow . Is it working ? I think . Hi . Hi . THE DINOSAURS PROJECT Translation from Spanish by jcdr v1.0 - 18.09.2012

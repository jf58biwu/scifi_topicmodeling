 NARRATOR : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day , it tests our limits , Ripped By mstoll bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . DON : Hunter May , meet my son , Dale . We need you to work your magic . - Send one message into the dome . - Barbie ! - Don 't jump ! JULIA : Barbie ! Maybe the guys who took Barbie are the same ones who want the egg . - How would they even know ? - We 'll protect it . No better place to hide than right under my dad 's nose . And you all think it powers the dome . - That 's the working theory , right ? - Yeah . It 's my job to lead the people of this town to freedom . BARBIE : Who are you ? - A friend of mine . Pauline Verdreaux . - Pauline Rennie ? - James ' mother . That door 's the way back into the dome . BARBIE : I know where this is . Grew up there . All right . Let 's go . Let 's go . What the hell ? - We 're back somehow . - Pauline ? Pauline ? It 's me . That 's impossible . You ... What are you doing here ? Did the dome send you ? Like Linda and Dodee to torment me ? What ? No , Jim . It 's really me . No , no . No , you died . - You died nine years ago . - I was never dead . You drove your car into a tree . I saw the wreck . I read the report . I picked out your casket . I was never inside the car . It was a cadaver . Lester Coggins helped me , and Lyle too . He knew what to use to make the car bum so that there would be nothing left . - It was the only way . - The only way for what ? It was the only way to get out of Chester 's Mill . I told you about my visions . You saw my paintings . I knew something terrible was coming . So you ran away and left me and Junior ? To protect my family . I thought the dome would follow me . And you would never let me go . You 're gonna stand here in your son 's room and make excuses to me ? - Stop it . - You destroyed him , Pauline . - You destroyed your own son . - Stop . For all these years , - I thought it was my fault . - Jim . Jim , I came back . Jim , I came back ! - Hey . - Hey . Look at this . See anything strange ? Its leaves have turned . Like it 's fall . Except it 's summer . The temperature 's dropped in the last two days . This is an oak . One of the first to change . Any idea why this is happening ? Somehow the dome is accelerating the seasons . Normally , fall 's my favorite . Book by the fire , nice glass of Pinot , but this is just odd . JULIA : Oh , my God . REBECCA : Julia . Julia ? You came back . I did . I 'm gonna get everybody out . What happened ? How are you here ? Barbie , how the hell did you get back ? Let 's talk inside . It 's freezing . Since when did it become Alaska in here ? No kidding . And , uh , Melanie 's not here . Junior either . We have the whole place to ourselves . Better keep each other warm . [ NORRIE CHUCKLES ] Wait , Melanie hasn 't been here in like a day . She 's probably at Julia 's . Out doing Jane Fonda exercises , whatever people did in the ' 80s . Come back . Oh , my God , Joe . The egg is gone . What ? You think she took it ? The way she protects that thing , I bet she did . Come on , let 's go find her . Junior ? Sorry . - I didn 't mean to scare you . - It 's okay . I should go . Julia might be worried . I shouldn 't have let us fall asleep . If she 's mad I didn 't come home , I 'll just blame it on you . Tell her you locked me up down here . What ? I was just kidding . Um ... You 're sure the egg 's safe down here ? Uh , this place is built to withstand nuclear bombs . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] - It 's the safest place in town . - Well , I guess I 'll see you later . Yes . See you later . ANGIE : Junior . - Angie ? - Think about what you 're doing . With her down here ? It 's not what you think . You 're gonna wanna follow your heart . Don 't . [ GASPS ] I don 't know what you mean . MELANIE : Junior ? Did you say something ? - No . - Okay . - Bye . - Bye . Angie ? Angie ? So you jump off an underground cliff and somehow land all the way in Zenith ? - Where you wake up on a playground . - Surprised the hell out of me too . But the same thing happened to Sam and Lyle . REBECCA : And you feel okay ? No physical injuries or psychological disturbances ? The way there was a blur , but I woke up , I was fine . The way back , I had this memory from a long time ago . What ? It was just something from when I was a kid . How 'd the others fare ? Well , Lyle , he didn 't come up out of the water with the rest of us . - Is he dead ? - I don 't know . You know , maybe he came up first . He drowned . Or maybe he 's trapped somewhere in between . I don 't know . What matters is that we can use that cliff to get everybody out of here , but we need a plan . Last thing we want is a stampede . Let 's start with the people we trust . I will walkie Tom and Andrea . Have them meet us at Sweetbriar in an hour . All right . There 's finally a way out . And I don 't know if we should take it . SAM : Melanie . Sam ? How are you alive ? SAM : I survived the fall . Listen , I 'm not back to hurt anyone . - Especially you . - You killed- - I didn 't push you into the crater that night . - So it was Lyle ? - Yes . I helped bury you . We all did . And then we ran . And I 've regretted it every day since . Imagine if you 'd trusted me and protected the egg . Maybe none of this would 've happened . Maybe the dome wouldn 't have come down . Maybe no one would 've died . Melanie . I am so sorry , Melanie . For everything . I have a lot of unfinished business . I figured this might be my only chance . You never know how many chances you 're gonna get . PAULINE : Jim , what are you doing ? JIM : I was just thinking . About us . I thought maybe I 'd find Junior out here . It 's exactly as it was the day I left . It was my way of keeping you alive . I used to come out here and stare at these and try to figure out what made you so- - Crazy ? - -tormented . Where were you , Pauline ? How did you get inside the dome ? Through a cellar door on Barbie 's family property in Zenith . Barbie ? You saw Dale Barbara in Zenith ? Fate , I guess . He came back with me . And Sam . And a former student of mine and Lyle . Except Lyle didn 't make it . I 'm sorry to hear that . But why would you want to come here ? For Junior . And you . I shouldn 't have run like that . Whatever my reasons , I was wrong . No , you weren 't . You were right . About the pink stars falling , about the dome , about everything , all of it . I wasn 't a good man back then . I know that . I didn 't listen . I kept pushing you away . But the dome has shown me things , a new way to be . And now it 's brought you back to me . Pauline , I can- - I can prove to you that I 've changed . Jim , I don 't know . You loved me once before , didn 't you ? Yes . Very much . Well , then we can be a family again . I 'm gonna lead everyone out of here . And when it 's over , when you and me and Junior are out , we 'll be together . I have always believed that the dome is here to protect us . What if it still is ? Maybe it started out that way , okay ? But there 's barely any food left . You got no medical supplies . All of a sudden , it 's getting colder by the hour . I realize that . But Lyle didn 't make it . I mean , if these people die getting out , that 's on us . What I know is , we stay here , we die here . And what 's waiting in Zenith ? The playground is under surveillance . You were interrogated , beaten . That 's because they wanted the egg . So I say this : Let 's give it to them . My dad sent that video , right ? He 's behind this whole thing . So my thinking is , if we give him what he wants , maybe they leave us alone . So we leverage the egg . I go first , and I tell them that it 's theirs so long as they let the whole town through . You come last with the egg . I have to go first . No . You 're- - No . There 's no way I 'm letting you do that . What would 've happened if you hadn 't escaped ? It 'll be worse if they capture you again . I should go . Julia , they 're not gonna go easy on you . I can handle it . And if you don 't get a message agreeing to the deal , you 'll be here . These people are gonna need you . If I don 't get a message agreeing to the deal , I 'm coming to find you . [ DOOR OPENS ] Melanie . Where were you ? I was , um ... - You 're back . BARBIE : Hey . It 's good to see you . Mel , where 's the egg ? It 's gone from Angie 's apartment . But Barbie 's here . Why do you want it ? Because it 's our way out . No . I 'm sorry , Julia , but I can 't tell you where it is . BARBIE : Hey . Can I talk to you for a second ? All hands should have a say in where the egg is kept . Melanie 's sitting on it in a nest she built somewhere . - So we 'll find it and we 'll take it back . - How ? Well , Julia and Dodee built that yagi thing . - It 's a piece of crap . - Yeah , so we 'll build a better one . NORRIE : Who the hell are you ? Hey . I 'm Hunter . And you 're Joe McAlister , vlog master , and @ neithernorrie , slaying the world 140 characters at a time . Okay , how do you know who we are ? Especially since you 've apparently just popped up out of the ether . Well , A , you guys are celebrities online . And B , I just came from Zenith with Barbie . - Barbie 's back ? - You came here on purpose ? Wasn 't about to turn down the chance to check out the dome . It was a watery arrival , but my phone survived . Obviously there 's no service , but that is my site 's homepage . Hounds of Diana . You e-mailed me . - And direct-tweeted me . - Yeah . Hunter . What are you doing here with all of this stuff ? Uh , desperately trying to establish contact with the outside world , but no luck . - Want help tracking down that egg ? - Are you a mind reader ? You guys were loud coming down . - What do you know about the egg ? - I work for Barbie 's dad at Aktaion . That egg 's been the subject of many a meeting . I 'd say our best bet 's a sound-wave detector . All energy sources emit a frequency , even if we can 't hear it . That could work . Think we could get our hands on a radar gun ? Yeah , the police station has to have one . You guys know if there 's anything to eat ? Because all I brought was this . - I call dibs . - Food from the outside ? Hey . What did it feel like when the bomb hit this thing ? I 'll tell you after you tell us how you got in here . No , I can 't tell you where the egg is . But even if it 's our ticket out of here ? No . You know , I 've seen that necklace before . Yeah . You found it where they buried me . Let me ask you . Have you ever been to a big white house in Zenith ? There 's a big lawn , a pool . There 's a root cellar . With a red door . - With a red door , yeah . - Yeah . My mom brought me there once . I spent the afternoon playing with this little boy . He was so sweet . We painted that door red and he put his hand on it . Yeah . That was me , Melanie . That was me . I was that boy . - But how do you know ? - I know because I remember . I was there . I remember . We were- - We were playing and then you had to leave in a hurry . Yeah , my mom was so upset . She ... That boy 's dad- - Your dad . - -He kept saying , " Laura , Laura , I 'm so sorry . " Oh , my God . What ? My parents used to fight about a woman named Laura , because I guess my dad was involved with her in a relationship before he married my mother . Your dad and my mom ? Yeah . They had- - They had a daughter together . Wait . - Are you saying-J' - I 'm saying that you are my sister , Melanie . That 's why she brought me there . To meet you before we moved . She never would tell me who my father was . It 's why you looked so familiar . Yeah . And that 's why I had this memory on the way back into the dome . This wasn 't a coincidence . - There 's a reason for this . - What 's the reason ? You and I are supposed to lead people out of here , into Zenith , but we need the egg to do that . No . No . No , I can 't give it up . I know something bad will happen if I don 't protect it . Melanie , I 'm not gonna let anything bad happen to you . Just come to Sweetbriar Rose with us . Okay ? Hear us out . Okay . JIM : Junior 's 18th birthday . [ SOBS ] I 've missed so much of my son 's life . Pauline , you 're gonna be a part of everything that has to do with this family moving forward . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] - Mom ? - Oh . James . Heh . James . How are you here right now ? It 's along story . You can , um ... You can tell him over breakfast , then . Where are you going ? I 'm sheriff . I 've got responsibilities to the town . I gotta talk to Barbie about an exit strategy . Be good to your mom , Junior . Uh , you want me to get you something to eat ? - No , no , I 'm okay . - Come on , I 'll make you something . - What do you like ? - lt 's fine . - Mom , Mom , stop , stop , stop . - Is there stuff-J You can have- - Lyle told me why you left . You saw the video and you didn 't tell Jim ? No . I didn 't know how . That 's for the best . Your father and I , we 're not good for each other . He thinks we 're a family again . If that helps us get out , that 's fine . Everybody had their reasons for coming back . You 're mine . Barbie 's back . Who else ? Sam . - Your uncle has a lot to atone for . - He can never do that for killing Angie . He did it because of what I put in my journal . You drew a picture . He murdered a girl . [ SIGHS ] - Where are you going ? - To the station . I 'm Dad 's deputy . [ SCREAMING ] [ KETTLE WHISTLING ] [ SCREAMS ] Make it stop ! Make it stop . You want everyone to jump off a cliff ? It 's not as crazy as it sounds . That cliff leads to the same place it did for Barbie : our deaths . BARBIE : It leads to Zenith . I guarantee it . Oh , I don 't believe it . Look , please . We need you guys onboard to help us get everyone out . We 'll use the census . We divide the town into groups . Everyone gets a leader and someone with first-aid experience and a mix of ages . Chester 's Mill is our home . - We 're not forcing anyone to leave . - But stayings a really bad idea . You feel how cold it is ? Our microclimate 's disrupted . With dwindling fuel and not enough food , we have to get out while we can . I 'm not doing anything till I know where Big Jim stands on this . - What about you , Tom ? - Sign me up as a leader . There 's nothing left for us here . So assuming people do take a leap of faith and jump off the cliff , what happens when we get to Zenith ? The plan 's for Julia to go first . She 's gonna lay out the terms . - Which are ? - Safe passage for the entire town . Once everyone else is out , Barbie and Melanie will jump with what they want . " They " being the soldiers in black , and what they want is the egg . [ DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ] And how do I fit into your little plan ? Because I 'm a part of it . Starting now . Is this what you were looking for ? That 's it . Okay . Changed the firmware to adjust the IF output . Yep . The wave guide 's modified , enhancing the tonal range . Uh , translation from geek , please ? Making it pick up high-pitched frequencies instead of movement . Oh , of course . Once we get out , don 't mention any of this to my parole officer . She wouldn 't approve . Wait . You have a parole officer ? Repercussion of exploiting the server vulnerabilities - of Fortune 500 companies . - Sounds awesome . Nothing compared to finding out what it 's like under the dome . Ironic . All we wanna know is what 's happening outside of it . Okay . You wanna do the honors ? It works . The egg is somewhere to the west . So , what are we waiting for ? Let 's go get that egg . Actually , Hunter , thanks for helping us build this thing , but that 's as far as it goes . Yeah . Unfortunately . This is just something Norrie and I have to do alone . Dude , it 's no worries . I actually wanna go get some pictures around town for my Hounds of Diana website . - You don 't trust him ? - I trust us . We 're two of the four hands , not him . NORRIE : You really think he 'd take the egg for himself ? How would he know there 's a locker at the school that leads to a cliff that 's the way out of Chester 's Mill and all you have to do is jump ? JOE : Maybe Barbie told him . Anyway , we have a signal . Let 's find that egg . So , what 's the problem ? Give them the egg , get our freedom . We have to do this carefully , Jim . Whoever 's out there is not gonna detain 2,000 people . This is still America . Oh , you mean the same people that bombed this place , right ? You don 't even know what you 're dealing with . I know what 's best for this town , which is why I 'll be going first to negotiate . Excuse me ? I 'm the sheriff . I 'm the only elected official here . You 're also a lifelong used car salesman . That 's right , which means I know how to cut a deal . Love me or hate me , I get things done . Your whole family 's here now , right ? He goes first . He goes first , they stay behind . That way , he 's got every reason to make sure that we all get through safely . Fine . Fine . Go first . But not until the entire town has been informed and the exit teams are in place . I 'll leave that in your hands . Spread the word as fast as you can . You heard it . The whole plan depends on taking the egg with us . What do you say , Melanie ? Pauline , we 're leaving . I worked it out . You , me and Junior , we 're getting out of here . We 're gonna be free . It 's coming soon . Soon . It 's coming . JIM : What are you- - ? Oh , my God . PAULINE : It 's the end of everything , Jim . I see it in my head . - That 's you , me and Junior . - My head , make it stop . Is this what 's gonna happen next ? ls our family in danger ? Oh , it hurts . - Make it stop . My head . - What 's- - ? - What hurts ? Make what stop ? - Make it stop . - The egg , it 's screaming . - The egg ? Where is it ? Where-l ? - Really ? You can 't hear that ? - I 'm trying . I 'm trying . I can 't hear it . You haven 't changed . You don 't believe me , like always . I have changed . I believe you . Everything you painted has come true . - I just - I can 't- - - Stop . - Calm down . Baby . - Stop . Stop it . - Calm down . - Stop it . Let me go . - Calm down ! - Get out of here . Get out . - Calm down . - Get out of here . - I 'm trying to help . - Get out ! Aah ! Just calm down . I 'll help you . I 'll get help , I promise . No , no , no ! No . Don 't lock me in here , please . Don 't lock me in here . - I 'm trying to keep you safe . - No , don 't lock me in here . Listen , I 'll get us out of here , I promise . I made a deal with a guy , okay ? He 's gonna take care of our family . I promise , he 'll get us out of here . - Trust me . - No . - Just gotta find that damn egg . - Please . Please . Jim ! [ EGG SCREAMING IN DISTANCE ] She was right about this too . You 'll let me carry the egg oven ? Yeah , I will be beside you the entire time . Do we really have to give it to those people out there ? Once our dad sees you alive again , that is all he 's gonna care about . Not some egg . I need a minute . Did you just make a promise you can 't keep ? Right now , this is all riding on her and Big Jim talking the talk . - Oh , that actually worked out well . - I know . He doesn 't mean anything to your dad . And now neither one of us has to risk being nabbed . Hey . Are you having second thoughts ? Not about leaving . No . About what ? We met because of the dome . And we never really talked about you and me out in the world . Oh . Julia . Hey . I want you in my life whether we end up in Zenith or wherever . That is a promise that I can keep . [ DOOR OPENS ] - Good . MELANIE : Guys . You want the egg or not ? - That 's it . - Let 's get it and get the hell out . - Why is it screaming ? - Something 's scaring it . It 's not us . You calmed it down . Now it 's time to go . Where ? The cliff under the school . That thing 's going to Zenith . Barbie 's back . There 's no reason . It 's not a debate . I don 't have to do anything you say . You 're right . If you don 't , I 'm gonna shoot him . Don 't worry about me , Norrie . All that matters is protecting the egg . You wouldn 't shoot Joe . There 's a long list of people who 've gone against me . I got no problem adding Joe McAlister to it . Okay . Let 's go . Pretty calm for a dead man . I figured you 'd stop by . I hope it doesn 't have to end this way . Angie hoped it wouldn 't end with you swinging an ax down on her head . I thought it would bring the dome down . I would do anything to take it back . You put her bracelet under my bed so I 'd think I blacked out and killed her . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know what else to do . Don 't worry . It 'll be over soon . Junior , I can 't take back what I 've done . You still have a choice . You 're right . - Bullet 's too quick . - Unh . You still have to suffer . [ JOE GRUNTING ] Get up . Get up ! [ GROANS ] Hit me . Fight back . Fight back . Fight back . Fight back . I 'm gonna do to you what you did to Angie . ANGIE : Junior , stop . HUNTER : Where is the signal ? JIM [ IN DISTANCE ] : Shut up . Keep going . Let 's go . Through the locker and to the cliffs . Come on . You can 't kill him . How can you come back and protect him ? Sam still has a part to play . So does each of the hands . If he dies , everyone under the dome will suffer . I loved you , and he took you away from me . You never loved me . You locked me up , wanting to keep me . That 's not love . That is possession . Why do something that can 't be undone to avenge a love that wasn 't even real ? You 're not real . You 're just the dome playing tricks on me . Junior , I 'm telling you not to do this . Look at me . Look at me . Don 't do it . - For me . JUNIOR : Look at me . No ! [ SOBBING ] See , Angie ? I really did love you . It 's freaking out . What are we supposed to do ? Don 't throw the egg . If that 's the power source to the dome , we could all die . If I don 't , he 'll kill you . That 's enough talking . That thing needs to go now . Look at it . It doesn 't want me to . Well , maybe it doesn 't wanna be here . This is about my family . Now you throw it over now . What about the rest of us ? You 've always said you love everybody in Chester 's Mill . I do . Then don 't make us do this . My wife is suffering . And everybody 's gonna get out too , okay ? But that egg needs to go now . See ? No one 's dying . Everything 's okay . NORRIE : Joe ! JOE : Run ! Run ! Run ! - It was right here . It was right here . - Do you think Junior took it ? We gotta go now . Let 's go . Okay , come on . No ! Melanie ! - Melanie ! - What 's wrong with her ? I don 't know . Barely breathing . Help me get her up . Come on , help me ! Hey , I 'm down here ! Come on ! Help me ! Help ! - Junior , where 's your uncle ? - What happened ? - I don 't know . Where 's Sam ? - Sam ! Put her down on the table . Get my EMT bag from the kitchen . She collapsed during the earthquake . Her pulse is weak . Shallow breathing . We gotta get her heart rate up . - What happened to your face ? - Don 't worry . Atropine ! It 's in the vial . Atropine . How long before it works ? [ GASPING ] Did you take the egg ? No . Is it gone ? Maybe Joe and Norrie have it . I just hope they 're okay . We should go find them . Hey , stay with her . And , Sam , don 't let anything happen to her . Her pulse is still weaker than it should be . Right now , what she needs is rest . The dome was right . If I 'd killed you earlier , she 'd be dead . Well , she still might be if I don 't find a way to keep her stable . She 's one of the hands . You better . - Is it safe ? - Safer than staying down here . Nice of Big Jim to wait . [ SCREAMS ] - I 've got you . JOE : Norrie ! Come on . Come on , I got you . - Pull me up . HUNTER : Just hang tight . Come on . Come on . Come on . You okay ? What the hell was that earthquake ? You don 't wanna know . Let 's get out of here in case another one happens . Yeah . Come on . I thought you went to take photos . I forgot my battery pack . Good thing , huh ? Yeah . [ GROUND RUMBLING ] JIM : Pauline . Pauline , are you okay ? They 're gone . - What 's gone ? - My visions . The minute the earthquake hit , they stopped . Well , let 's go . Come on , let 's get out of here . I don 't know what 's gonna happen now . I do . We go get Junior and we 're the first three over the cliffs , okay ? I tell the guard I gave him what he wanted . The egg stopped screaming . I know , because I threw it over the cliff , to Zenith . - No . - I did it- - I did it for you . I did it- - No , Jim . No . No . What have you done ? Joe and Norrie have to be here somewhere . - Barbie . Julia . - Big Jim made us throw the egg - off the cliff . - He did what ? - He had a gun . - All right , let 's go . Come on . Phil ! - Phil , stop ! - Barbie , here . Careful . He 's gone . What the- - ? There 's a bottom now . The egg 's gone . The passage dosed . We 're stuck here . Ripped By mstoll

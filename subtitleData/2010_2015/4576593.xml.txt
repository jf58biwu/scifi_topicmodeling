 Pretty amazing , huh ? It was ... incredible ! It was . Period . The sexy movements make me horny . Wow ! Thanks , Todd ! That 's the idea , yeah ! He 's not watching you . He 's cheer-leering . 1-2-3-4 , Crowley Goats are gonna score ! 5-6-7-8 , Crowley Goats are really great ! They move so gracefully . Like swans . Bird-like swans ... Can we go already ? Fine , but I get to look at your butt on the way out . Oh great ! No you don 't . Mmm , yeah ... Hey , thanks again for showing me that uh ... that thing ... what did you call it ? Practice ? Yeah ! I 'm gonna be so much better now . Well , anything for a man in uniform . It 's more of a costume . Don 't ruin it . Okay ... Our killer cheer ! Show it to me ! Now ! Go ! 1-2-3-4 ! Crowley Goats are gonna score ! 5-6-7-8 ! Crowley Goats are really great ! 1-2-3-4 ! Crowley Goats are gonna score ! 5-6-7-8 ! Crowley Goats are really great ! That 's it , one of you is going home and I want a name . Crystal 's the one with the cankles . At least my tits don 't smell like blue cheese . Stop fighting ! We should be working together . Yeah , says you , Noodle Arms ... Noodle arms ruined our cheer . A cheerleading squad must be tough like a chain , and the weak links must be eliminated . You 're the weak link , Ariel ! If we were allowed to eat ... Enough complaining ! You 're off the squad . Looks like it 's back to the honour roll for you . And the rest of you don 't pay attention to her ! Sorry , Ariel . You know I totally didn 't mean it . Yeah , we 're still BFFs , right Noodle Arms ? Ugh ! What 's her problem ? I don 't know , she 's probably hungry ? I order you to put down your snacks and help me brainstorm . Your father never needed our help . He always came up with the plans himself . He was the leader . Or are you saying you 're not as wise as he was ? I am twice as wise . And once I become the pure evil one , I will show you all . Now ... begone . Hey ... when are we gonna kill this dipshit ? Patience . Begone ! Look who comes asking for my help ! After what you did , cutting off my head . Let 's put the past behind us , father . I need your help . The minions won 't listen to me . It 's like they have no respect for me . Don 't worry about them , Atticus . Do what you must ! Be a man . Get that book . But how do I do that , father ? ! Bait the book . Spring the trap . Seize the power . Bait the book . Spring the trap . Seize the power . Yes ... I suppose that makes sense . Come closer , Atticus . You 've failed before but this time I 've got a good feeling . You can do it , my son . Thank you , father . You 're very wise . But I 'm twice as wise ... I 'm gonna have to give somebody a shampoo ! The Beast ... The Beast ... Dudes ... people are saying something ate the cheerleader with the Noodle Arms . What people ? Us . We 're calling it ... " The Beast . " The Beast ! The Beast ! The Beast ! The Beast ! The Beast . The Beast ! Ok , stop calling it that ! We don 't know what happened ! And if she got eaten , guys where 's the blood ? Yep , I was thinking the same thing . Oh , hi gang . Are you here too ? Stop spying on us , douche ! Too late . I heard everything . I know all about The Beast ... And I will find it before you ! Bait book , spring trap , seize the power ... What a waste of a perfectly good cheerleading uniform ! It 's coming for us next ... I 'm too pretty to die ... The Beast ... What kills cheerleaders and doesn 't leave any blood behind ? Maybe Noodle Arms used the book to stop her period , but the book ended up sucking all the blood out of her ! And then she was eaten by ... The Beast ! Seriously ? There 's no beast ! Ok ? A cheerleader has disappeared , so let 's start there . Hannah and I will join the cheerleaders and look for clues . We will ? You know ... Jenny 's onto something with this whole cheerleader angle . You 're agreeing with me ? But , she 's all wrong . There it is ... I spent a lot of time last night thinking about those cheerleaders . The way they move . The way they high-kick . The way they shake their pom poms . Were you jerking off when you were thinking about all this ? That 's not the point ! I will train us to be like those cheerleaders ! Unified ! Graceful ! And choreographed ! And then we can defeat The Beast ! You wanna train us to fight something that you made up ? No . All those in favour of training to fight ? All those in favour of infiltrating the cheerleaders and then training never ? But , Jenny ... Without my training , The Beast will kill you . And rip up your clothes ! I think I 'll do just fine on my own . Buh-bye . So , it 's cheerleaders you like to eat , is it ? How about a cheerleader buffet ? A ch-uffet . Good news , maggots ! There 's a pep rally tomorrow , so I hope you brought your iron panties ! Where is everyone ? Everyone else quit because of ... The Beast ! Weaklings . Who needs them . They 're just dragging us down . Our killer cheer ! Show it to me ! Now ! Go ! But , we can 't ... without Ariel ... She 's right . According to the pep rally rule book , you need at least four cheerleaders on a squad . Isn 't that right , Wanda ? Are you volunteering , skank ? You call it volunteering , I call it saving your ass , slut . Then I guess it 's time to try on your outfit , jizztrap . Bring it on ... Slut . It 's the only one we have left , Dickmitten . It 's all ripped up , so you can look like a whore right away . Oh , I will . Slut . Oh ... Mmmm ... The Beast ! It won 't get me ! Jasmine ? ! What 's going on ? ! Whistle once if you 're okay , twice if you 're not . Ah ... What are you screaming about ? ! This ain 't some yoga thing , is it ? No ! I 'm training them how to fight . Oh ... Fine . Proceed . Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Ugh ! Ha . You 're doing it all wrong . You have to do exactly as I do . Don 't put ' em in the box , Todd . What are you talking about ? I don 't even have a box . Anyway , I 'm gonna go sleep somewhere else . And by somewhere else I mean with a woman . Remember , Todd ... don 't put ' em in the box . " Think outside the box ... " That 's not what he said . Quiet ! I 'm trying to think outside the box . Ok , is this recreation or is this for training ? Jimmy told me to think outside the box . The box is not being high . But you guys smoke marijuana all the time . So , isn 't this your version of thinking inside the box ? Whoa . I 'm getting out of here before The Beast gets me too ! I hear something ! Uh oh . Somebody 's paranoid . Wooooooo ... I didn 't smoke anything ! Hannah 's just naturally paranoid , aren 't you , sweetie ? Ok , it 's a scream ! I heard a scream ! Come on , we have to check it out ! Huh-uh ! Jenny ! Nooooooooo ! Ugh , it 's not me . It 's Crystal . Oh , yeah ... I , um ... I know . Well , that leaves three cheerleaders . Two ! The Beast got Jasmine . That means The Beast 's next target is either Wanda ... or ... Bring it on . Attention , students ... Regardless of the recent disappearances , A.K.A. " Beast attacks " , today 's pep rally is still on . I repeat , the pep rally is still on . Thank you . Bait the book , spring the trap , seize the power . Jenny , you shouldn 't be dressed like that ! Especially on the day of the pep rally ! The Beast will get you ! Three cheerleaders disappeared yesterday . Aren 't you worried ? We do this every week . Obviously somebody 's used the book and they 're doing stuff with cheerleaders . I 'm staying undercover . Well , it 's time to get ... up-dercover . Wow . I hope you 're better at finding beasts than you are at knowing words . Buh-bye . Jenny 's self-destructive behavior has given me an idea . What if , instead of one mascot at the pep rally there were ... three mascots ? Cool ! Who would they be ? Us . Undercover us . The pep rally 's in 15 minutes . Where are we gonna get uniforms ? That was those people ... Now , the real reason you 're here ... The main course ... tasty , tasty cheerleaders . Put your hands together , Crowley hi ... 3-2-1 ! Rrraaaaahhh ! Those are some hairy bitches ... Wanda ! Ruuuuuun ! Gasp ! Thwack ! Ugh ! Puny cheerleader ... I was once like you . I was the weakest link ! But then I used the book . Then we used the book ! Now , we are ... The Beast ! Ugh ! Now everybody put your hands in the air ! She said put your hands in the fucking air ! Now , cheer ! 2-4-6-8 ! Who should we eviscerate ? I want a name ! Not cheering loud enough ! Smoosh ! Ugh ! Hey , buddy , are you okay ? Holy fucking shit , dude ! Totally ! Gang ! Assemble ! So what do we do ? I was hoping you had an idea ! Sweater dude ! Where you off to , man ? Just thought I 'd take a walk in the park ... Clear my head . Don 't tell me you 're running away from your destiny ? No , I 'm running away from some butch chicks ! They 've got muscles , and moustaches , and they uh ! and ahhhhh ! Dude ! You need to man up . Don 't be such a loser , loser . You are right ... I am the pure evil one . I can do whatever I put my mind to . That 's the spirit , sweater dude . Now march the fuck back in there and grab up your hairy nuts off those teenage girls , man ! I shall . Fucking say it louder , pussy ! I shall ! Show me ! Ugh ! Ugh ! Ugh ! I shall ! Too easy . 3-5-7-9 ! We will blow your fucking mind ! Ok , enough waiting ... let 's do this ... remember the most important thing is to not get a hole punched through your head . 1 ... 2 ... 3 ! Yeah ! Bait ! The ! Book ! Spring ! The ! Trap ! Seize ! The ! Power ! You 've ! Got something ! That I want ! Gimme that belt ! Ooooooooohhhhhh ! No ! Anybody else have anything they wanna say ? Ye-ah ! I hope you juice heads are ready for a fight , because we 're gonna punch your dicks so hard they go back inside you and look like vaginae again ! Curtis , whore frost chop ! Hannah , stonehenge kamikaze ! Jenny , fart rhapsody ! Fart rhapsody ? Ready ? Chaaaarge ! Todd ! Don 't put ' em in a box . That 's it ... Hannah ! Quick ! Gimme some science ! Pinch the posterior auricular nerve ! I don 't know what that is ! Behind the ear ! Curtis , gimme some pep ! Gimme a T ! T ! Gimme an O ! O ! Gimme a D ! D ! Gimme a D ! D ! What do you got ? Todd ! What do you got ? ! Todd ! Todd ! Todd ! Todd ! The crowd 's turning against us ! They don 't love us anymore ! Quick ! Our killer cheer ! Go ! They 're getting closer ! They 're not stopping ! Jenny ! Do what you do best ! What 's that ? ! Crush their spirits ! I don 't know how ! Crushing your spirit comes naturally to me ! Improvise ! Go ! Hey , sluts ! Is that really ... the best you got ? No ... You 're a bunch of big ... hairy ... Sluts ... Cock ... pockets ... Cock pockets ! No wonder the crowd 's against you ! You 're a bunch of ... Ball dockers ! Ball dockers ! And I heard that tramp ... Said that you 're both ... Jizz magicians ! Wha ? Because they make jizz disappear . Oooh , yeah ... Well , if you ask me ... Ariel 's the jizz magician . Isn 't that right , Noodle Arms ? I do not have Noodle Arms anymore ! I 'm ... I 'm ... The weakest link ! Get her ! Yeah ! So ... Does this mean you 're not a cheerleader anymore ? You know it was just to find the book . Yeah , but I mean ... You 're still gonna keep the uniform , right ? Only in your dreams , Todd . How can you sit there and banter ? Don 't you realize what this means ? The school just got a lot less bitchy ? The Beast is still out there ! No ... no , it isn 't , Curtis . The cheerleaders were The Beast , dude . I think we learned a valuable lesson about teamwork , and that lesson is ... That my leadership clinched our victory ! Thank you , Hannah ! That 's not what I was going to say ... I talked them into killing each other . Because I told you to do it . It was Jimmy 's idea . I implemented it . I was undercover . We were also undercover . We killed that pep rally ! Yeah ! I said bait the book , Atticus . Not strengthen Todd Smith and his gang ! I will , I will find a way to get the book , father . I swear . No , Atticus ! You will do what you always do . Fail . Fail , fail , fail ! Fail ! Fail ! Quiet ! I 'm the pure evil one ! You 're just a head in a cooler .

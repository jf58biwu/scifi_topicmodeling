 Sync by Emin Get Charlie . Doctor Holloway ! Charlie ! - What ? - Come quick ! - Did you date it ? - 35.000 years , maybe older . You got to be kidding me . It 's the same configuration . Only it 's got to predate the others , by a millennium . I think they want us to come and find them . Yes . - What happened to that man ? - He died . Why aren 't you helping them ? They don 't want my help . Their God is different than ours . Why did he die ? - Sooner or later everyone does . - Like mommy ? Like mommy . Where do they go ? Everyone has their own word . Heaven , Paradise ... Whatever it 's called , - it 's someplace beautiful . - How do you know it 's beautiful ? Cause that 's what I choose to believe But what do you believe , darling ? Good morning , David . Transmitting message . No response . Whilst this matter of articulation is attested ... in the Indo European descendants as a purely pair of linguistic form , it is phonemic in the ancestral form dating back five millennia or more . Now , let 's attempt Schleicher 's fable . Repeat after me : Perfect . - Mr. Lawrence ? - Yes . - Flimsy , sir . - Thank you . You 'll do that once too often . It 's only flesh and blood . Michael George Hartley , you 're a philosopher . And you 're balmy ! - It damn well hurts ! - Certainly , it hurts . Well what 's the trick , then ? The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . The trick , William Potter , is not minding that it hurts . Attention ! Destination threshold ! Attention ! Destination threshold ! Attention ! Destination threshold ! Robe ! How long ? 2 years , 4 months , 18 days , 36 hours , 15 minutes . Any causalities ? Causalities , ma 'am ? Has anyone died ? No , ma 'am . Everyone is fine . Well then wake them up . Try to relax , Dr. Shaw . My name is David . Your mind and body are in a state of shock , as a result of stasis . It 's alright , it 's perfectly normal . Eli ? We 're here , baby . Drink plenty of water . Drink plenty of fluids . Hydration aids muscle mass . All crew . Consume shakes with high protein content . What the hell is that ? It 's Christmas . Need the holidays to sum time is still moving . Mission briefing is about to start , Captain . Might wanna make your way down . Well , I haven 't had my breakfast yet . Has this seat been taken ? Hi . I 'm Millburn . Biology . Nice to meet you . Look , um , no offense , but ... I 've been asleep two years . I ain 't here to be your friend . I 'm here to make money . You got that ? Okay . I bet a hundred credits , it 's a terraforming survey . No . If it 's a terraforming survey they would just tell us . This is a corporate run , they aren 't telling us shit . Come on . - Hundred . - Alright . You 're on . You look nervous , Eli . I 'm trying to keep my feet on the ground . - And there you will . - Good morning . For those of you I hired personally , it 's nice to see you again . For the rest of you , I am Meredith Vickers , and it is my job to make sure you do yours . Okay , then . On with the show . Weyland Corporations . Building better worlds . Hello , friends . My name is Peter Weyland . I am your employer . I am recording this , 22 June 2091 . And if you are watching this , you have reached your destination , and I am long dead . May I rest in peace . There 's a man sitting with you today . His name is David . He is the closest thing to a son I 'll ever have . Unfortunately , he 's not human . He will never grow old , and he will never die , and yet he is unable to appreciate these remarkable gifts , for that would require the one thing , that David will never have . A soul . I have spent my entire lifetime contemplating the questions : Where do we come from ? What is our purpose ? What happens when we die ? And I have finally found two people , who have convinced me they 're on the verge of answering . Drs. Holloway and Shaw , if you would please stand . As far as you 're concerned , they 're both in charge . The titan Prometheus wanted to give mankind , equal footing with the gods , and for that , he was cast from Olympus . Well , my friends , the time has finally come for his return . Doctors , please . The floor is yours . Okay , Uh - wow . Alright . Never had to follow a ghost before . Okay . Let me show you why you guys are here . These are images of archaeological digs from all over the Earth . That 's Egyptian , Mayan , Samarian , Babylonian , that 's Hawaiian at the end there , then Mesopotamian . Now this one here is our most recent discovery . It 's a 35,000 year old cave painting , from the Isle of Skye in Scotland . These are ancient civilizations , they were separated by centuries , they shared no contact with one another , and yet ... the same pictogram , showing men worshiping giant beings , pointing to the stars was discovered at every last one of them . The only galactic system that matched , was so far from earth , that there 's no way that these primitive ancient civilizations , could have possibly known about . But it just so happens , that system ... has a sun , a lot like ours . And based on our long range scans , there seemed to be a planet . Just one planet with the moon , capable of sustaining life , and we arrived there this morning . So you 're saying we 're here because of a map , you two kids found in a cave , is that right ? - No . - Yeah . No , not a map . An invitation . From whom ? We call them Engineers . Engineers ? You mind telling us what they engineered ? They engineered us . Bullshit . Okay , so uh , do you have anything to back that up ? I mean , look , if you 're willing to discount three centuries of Darwinism , that 's ... wooh ! But how do you know ? Hmm ? I don 't . But it 's what I choose to believe . Doctors . Ms. Vickers would like to have a quick word before the adventure begins . Wow . Nice place . It 's actually a separate module with its own self-contained life support . Air . Food . Anything Ms. Vickers would need to survive a hostile environment . Okay , so she lives on a life boat . Yes . I do . I like to minimize risk . David , why don 't you make the doctors a drink . I 'll take a Vodka . Up . Charlie , look . It 's a Polling medpod . They only made a dozen of these . Ms. Shaw . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . Please don 't touch that . It 's a very expense piece of machinery . It does bypass surgery . What do you need it for ? I think there might be some confusion about our relationship . Weyland found you impressive enough to fund this mission , but I 'm fairly certain your Engineers , are nothing but scribblings of savages living in dirty little caves . But let 's say I 'm wrong , and you do find these beings down there . You won 't engage them , you won 't talk to them , you 'll do nothing but report back to me . Ms. Vickers , is there an agenda that you 're not telling us about ? My company paid a trillion dollars to find this place and to bring you here . Had you raised the money yourself , Mr. Holloway , we 'd happily be pursuing your agenda . But you didn 't . And that makes you an employee . But if we can 't make contact , why did you ... why did you even bring us here ? Weyland was a superstitious man . He wanted a true believer on board . Cheers . So , no response ? I 'm sorry , no . Maybe they didn 't understand it . How are you lessons going , David ? I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages , to their roots . I 'm confident I can communicate with them , provided you 're thesis is correct . Provided it 's correct . That 's good ! That 's why they call it a thesis , doctor . What are you smiling about ? Alright , Mr. Ravel , Mr. Chance , let 's take her down . - Roger that . - Yes , captain . - How we 're doing ? - Great . Alright , boss . All personal , this is the captain . - Brace for entry . - Yes , captain . That means you too , Vickers . All systems on line . What is the atmosphere ? Atmosphere , seventy one percent nitrogen , twenty one percent oxygen , - traces of argon gas . - Woh ! Now that 's weather ! Just like home . Only if you 're breathing through an exhaust pipe ! CO2 is over three percent . Two minutes without a suit , you 're dead . Peak , port side . Woh ! Fifty two thousand ! Makes Everest look like a baby brother . Alright . Take us round . We 'll use it as our point of entry . Plain data rising up . We got a couple of hard spots . Could be metal . No radio , no feed source . Nobody 's home ! There is nothing in the desert , and no man is nothing . What was that ? Just something from a film I like . Let 's go through that gateway . Juice air speed by a hundred knots . Going through . Nice and slow . Keep us steady , boys . There ! No , what are you doing ? Dr. Holloway , why don 't you take a seat ? Right there . God does not build in straight lines . Starboard side ! This valley ! Captain , do you think you can put us down there ? Yeah , I wouldn 't be any good if I couldn 't do that ! Mr. Ravel , starboard . 90 degrees . One mile , port bow . Engage landing sequence ! System manual ! Commence landing ! - Down here . - Okay . Yeah baby ! Bring her down in five , four ... two , easy does it . Captain , would you please tell the survey team to suit up , and meet us in the airlock . There 's only six hours left of day light . Why don 't you leave it till the morning ? Oh , no , no , no , no ! It 's Christmas , Captain , and I wanna open up my presents . You , boy , you 're coming with us . I 'd be delighted . Attention ! Ramp will open in five minutes . Hey , Jackson . What 's that for ? Expedition security . My job is to makes sure everybody nice and safe . This is a scientific expedition . No weapons . Alright then . Good luck with that . David , why are you wearing a suit , man ? I beg your pardon ? You don 't breath , remember ? So , why wear the suit ? I was designed like this , because you people are more comfortable , interacting with your own kind . If I didn 't wear the suit , it would defeat the purpose . Making you guys pretty close , huh ? Not too close I hope . Attention ! Ramp will open in 15 seconds . Ramp will open in 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . Hey . This is just one small step for mankind . Seriously ? Wooh ! Come on ! You ready to do this ? I know you are ! Hey , Fifield . I want a spectrograph on the structure . I wanna know if it 's natural or if somebody put it there , alright ? I can 't tell you if it 's natural or not . But what I can tell you is , it 's hollow . Prometheus , are you seeing this ? Affirmative , we see it . - You ready ? - Yeah . Let 's do it . - After you . - After you . Careful . - Prometheus , we 're going in . - Copy that . What 's back here ? Some kind of a corridor ? Mr. Fifield , let 's get a grid of the structure . I want the whole interior . If there 's anything in here worth looking at , these pups will find them . Pups ? Yeah , pups . My pups . Prometheus , we are now mapping . Copy that . Well , I 'll be damned . - Fifield , you got a read ? - Yeah . Pups are saying this way . Look at this . Oh , Charlie ! Jesus ! Sun light 's heating the water . Check out the humidity . Yeah , look at the CO2 levels . Outside it 's completely toxic and in ... in here , there 's nothing . It 's breathable . What are you doing ? - Charlie , don 't be an idiot ! - Hey , don 't be a skeptic . Right ? There 's something generating an atmosphere . David ? Dr. Holloway is correct . Cleaner than earth , actually . They were terraforming here ! - Please , don 't do ... - Look , Eli ... - Eli , I 'm not wearing this thing anymore ! - Please , don 't ! - Do you copy ? Do you hear me ? - Wish me luck , babe . Do you copy ? Do not remove your head gear ! Woo ! You crazy bastard ! Prometheus , connect our suit cameras , if you want to continue watching this freak show . We are taking our helmets off . Copy that . Switching feeds . Well , come on ! Pay up . Pay ? Pay what ? What do you mean , pay what ? Something manufacturing breathable air down there . That , mate , it 's terraforming . No , no , no , no ! The bet was why we came here . If you said the dead old man wanted to talk to Martians , then I pay . Oh , come on ! A hundred credits ! Put it towards a lap dance of Miss Vickers . How about that , hey ? It 's minus 12 in here . So , why is this water not frozen ? Maybe it ain 't water . Maybe it 's Martian piss . That 's your scientific theory . Is it , Mr. Biology ? Whatever it is , it sure is clean . Maybe it 's kind of residuum . Impressive . What was that ? David ? David ? What is that ? David ? Eli ! What the hell was that ? Aren 't we glad we didn 't bring weapons ? Come on , Eli . Let 's go . Who 's idea was that ? Come on ! Come on ! Where did it go ? Wait ! Wait ! There it is . There it is . Oh , my God , Charlie ! We found them ! What do you mean , them ? It is them , Eli . Looks like a door , and he 's been decapitated by it . Son of a bitch ! They were right . What , did you want them to be wrong ? David ... please tell me you can read that . Perhaps . No . No . I 'm out of here ! Hey , Fifield ! Where you going ? What ? Look , I 'm just a geologist ! I like rocks ! I love rocks ! Now it 's clear you two don 't give a shit about rocks . But what you do seem to care about is gigantic dead bodies , and I don 't really have anything to contribute , in the gigantic dead body arena ! I 'm gonna go back to the ship , if you don 't mind . Anyone want to join me , hey ? You staying ? - No . Ship 's good . - Yeah . Ship 's very good . Congratulations on meeting your maker . Thank you . Pull yourself together , man . I thought you were the crazy one . Do you have the carbon reader ? Thank you . How long has he been dead ? Two thousand years , give or take . What are you doing , David ? I 'm attempting to open the door . Wait ! We don 't know what 's on the other side . Oops ! Sorry . Look , Ford . It 's the head ! An amazing state of preservation . - We 'll take it in . - Yeah . Remarkably human . Beautiful painting . It 's a mural . Stop ! Stop ! Don 't touch it . It 's alright . Please , don 't touch anything . It 's sweating . Organic . Oh , no ! Charlie , the murals are changing ! I think we 've affected the atmosphere in the room . Charlie , do you copy ? Oh , the head ! Ford , quickly help me bag the head ! - Boss . - What 'd you got ? We got an incoming storm front . Silica and lots of static . This is not good . I see it . Ground crew , this is Janek . I need you to hustle back right now ! Ground crew , do you copy me ? I got two hundred kilometer winds with airborne silica , and enough static to fry your suit . Copy that , sir . But we need more time here . I 'll be closing the outer doors in fifteen minutes . I sincerely hope you can make it . Charlie ! David ! We must leave now ! This is just another tomb . David ! - On three . - 1 , 2 , 3 , up ! Let 's go ! Easy , easy , careful . David , we are leaving ! Come on ! Dammit ! They 've already taken off ! Come on , let 's go ! Prometheus to Ground crew ! You 're running out of time ! I repeat ! You 're running out of time ! Alright . Come on . Let 's go ! Go faster ! Charlie ! The head ! Eli ! No ! What are doing ? Hatch doors close in five seconds ! Shit . Damit ! Hold on ! - Goddamit . - Doors are closing ! Eli ! Don 't move ! Charlie ! Grab my hand ! No ! No ! Eli ! Eli ! I got it . Decontamination at level three . So what was that , Eli ? Huh ? You could have compromised the entire mission , not to mention almost killing yourself ! Are you alright ? Yes . Thank you , David . My pleasure . Alright , doctors . The optimism is real good to have you back , but where 's Millburn and Fifield ? Aren 't they back yet ? - Keep them up for a while . - Alright . We 've been here before , Fifield ! I don 't know , it all looks the same to me . Boys , this is the Captain . Listen up . Between the static electricity and the wind speed , well , there ain 't no safe way to come get you . What ? Now the temperature is dropping rapidly , so get your helmets on and stay warm , until the storm passes . Captain , can you get a message to the scientist and that zealot girlfriend of his ? Mmhmm . - You got a pen nearby ? - Nope . Nope . I think we got it . Tell them I said to fuck themselves . - Copy ? - Copy that . Alright , boys . Keep you head down , and we 'll come get you in the morning . - Which way now ? - Alright . Which way ? Okay . Sample is sterile . No contingent present . David . So , are they all dead ? What ? Who ? Your Engineers . Are they all dead or aren 't they ? I don 't know . We just got here . Scan . Do you even care they 're all dead ? Weyland cared . Dr. Shaw , have a look at this . - That 's not an exoskeleton . - No . I think it 's a helmet . Let 's see if we can lift it up . - Yeah - Should be able to prise this open . It 's too heavy for us . David ? Careful . Like so . What is that on its head ? It looks like new cells , - in a state of ... - Change ! Yes . Changing into what ? Can you run a stemline into the locus coeruleus ? I ... I think we can trick the nervous system , into thinking its still alive . Thirty amps . - Okay . - No more . Lightly making an incision . Okay . Go up forty . Okay , forty up . Did you see that ? - Yes . - Yep , see ! Go up another ten . Okay , up ten . You went a little bit too much . Go down ten . Jesus ! Okay , go down ten . Down another twenty . Yeah ... I 'm trying it 's up . - I 'm trying it 's up and down . - Go down . Ford , stop it ! Oh , my God ! David ! Contain it , now ! Contain it ? Turn it off , now ! Oh , God ! The smell ! Mortal after all . Ford , take a sample . Let 's have a look . No , sir . I will take care of it . Yes , sir . Understood . I 'm sorry . Unfortunately slightly premature . Of course , sir . Ms. Vickers ? What did he say , David ? I don 't think he 'd want me to tell you . What did he say ? I 'm sorry , that 's confidential . So help me God , I will find the cord that makes you run and I will cut it ! What did he say ? He said ... " try harder " . Cup of tea , ma 'am ? - Genetic view . - Okay . Let 's have a look at its DNA . Isolate the strand . Okay . - Compare it to the gene sample . - Yeah . Overlay . Processing . Processing . DNA matched . Oh my God . It 's us . It 's everything . What killed them ? Big things have small beginnings . Am I interrupting ? I thought you might be running low . Pour yourself a glass , pal . Thank you , but I 'm afraid it would be wasted on me . Oh . Right . I almost forgot . You 're not a real boy , huh ? I 'm very sorry that your Engineers are all gone , Dr. Holloway . You think we wasted our time coming here , don 't you ? You 're question depends on the understanding , what you hope to achieve by coming here . What we hoped to achieve ? Was to meet our makers . To get answers . Why they ... why they even made us in the first place . Why do you think your people made me ? We made you cause we could . Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you , to hear the same thing from your creator ? I guess it 's a good thing you can 't be disappointed , huh ? Yes , it 's wonderful actually . May I ask you something ? Please do . How far would you go , to get what you came for all this way for ? your answers ? What would you be willing to do ? Anything and everything . That 's worth drinking to I 'd imagine . Here 's mud in your eye , pal . Good health . It 's those things . Are they real ? Of course they 're real ! Jesus Christ ! Look at the pile ! Look how high up they are ! Yeah , it looks like they were running from something . Okay . Don 't touch , okay ? Maybe those things opened up from the inside . It looks like it exploded . Looks like a scene out of some sort of holocaust painting . Whoa ... So whatever killed them , is long gone , right ? Millburn , Fifield , This is Prometheus . what is your position ? Prometheus , this is Millburn . Uh ... We are at seven-four-zero - one-four-seven - seven , why ? Just got a ping , about one click west of you . What do you mean , a ping ? Well ... whatever that probe was picking up , it 's not dead , it 's reading lifeform . Okay , what do you mean a lifeform ? Is it ... is it moving ? No . I don 't think so . Look , Captain , you 're uh ... you 're obviously not seeing what we 're seeing down here . But if you were , you wouldn 't be talking about a bloody ping , yeah ? No , boys . The signal 's been coming in sporadically , since the storm hit . That 's no good to us here , Captain ! Is it ... is it moving ? Are these things moving ? No . No , it just disappeared actually . - Must be a glitch . - What do you mean , a glitch ? Alright , boys . Sleep tight . Try not to bug each other . Captain , what do you mean , a glitch ? - Millburn ! Millburn ! - What do you mean ? Wait ! He said ... - He said , one click west . - Yeah . Now we ... we don 't want to check that out , do we ? Huh ? - Shit , no ! - Where we gonna go ? East . Yeah , East . Fucking glitch , man ! Pings , glitch , lifeform ! What the fuck ? Based on the behavior of the subject in these holographic recordings , we 're still attempting to identify what caused the head to combust . I can 't help but wonder , was there an outbreak here ? You rang , ma 'am ? I have something important to tell you . What is that ? This is a rose that I had frozen with the champagne , I was gonna give it to you when we found what we came for . We did find what we came for . They were here . This is ... The most significant discovery in history of mankind . Oh , I know . It 's incredible , it really is . But I wanted to talk to them . I mean , don 't you ... don 't you wanna know why they came ? Why they abandoned us ? I just want answers , baby . We were right , Charlie . I have proof . Look . Their genetic material predates ours . We come from them . - You 're kidding . - No . Okay . Okay . I guess you can take your father 's cross off now . Why would I wanna do that ? Because they made us . And who made them ? Well , exactly . We 'll never know . But here 's what we do know . That there is nothing special about the creation of life . Right ? Anybody can do it . I mean , all you need is a dash of DNA and half a brain , right ? I can 't . I can 't create life . What does that say about me ? Eli , that 's not ... I didn 't mean ... I wasn 't talking about ... Children ? Us . Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! Elizabeth Shaw , you are the most special person I have ever met in my life . And I love you . Oh . How much longer is this gonna take ? I don 't know , I 'm just the Captain . That thing sounds like a dying cat , by the way . I 'll have you know that this " thing " , once belonged to Stephen Stills . Am I supposed to know who that is ? You know , if you wanna get laid , you really don 't have to pretend to be interested in the pyramid scan . I mean , you could just say , " Hey , trying to get laid . " I could ... I could say that . Right ? But then it wouldn 't make sense , why I would fly myself a half a billion miles from every man on earth , if I wanted to get laid , would it ? Hey , uh ... Vickers ! Hey , Vickers ! I was wondering ... Are you a robot ? My room , ten minutes . " Well , if you can 't be with the one you love . " " Love the one you 're with " . " Love the one you 're with . " Mill , what 's all this black stuff ? Gazpacho . Is that tobacco ? - Huh ? - Is that tobacco in your respirator ? Yeah . Sure . Tobacco . You know , on behalf of scientists everywhere , I am ashamed to count you amongst us , Fifield , really . - Hey , Millburn ? - Yeah ? You see this thing ? What do you think this thing was ? Some kind of a God ? Something they worshiped , what ? I don 't know . Kind of looks like ... What 's that ? - What the hell is that ? - Oh , my God ! Okay . - Okay . Just stay calm . Stay quiet . - Mill ! - What is it ? - It 's okay . I can handle this . Hey , baby . Hey . We have a elongated reptile type creature . Maybe ... maybe thirty , forty inches with transparent skin . It 's beautiful . Okay ! Prometheus , we have two ! Look at you . Look at you , baby . Jesus ! Look at the size of that ! What is it ? - You need to stay calm ! - What 's there to be calm about ? You need to stay calm , because she is beautiful . She ? What in the hell makes you think that 's female ? Because she 's a lady . Look . Ah . Hey . Hey . She 's mesmerized . Come here . Come here . It 's okay . It 's okay . Hey , baby . Ohh ! You 're strong ! Maybe you should help me now , okay ? Get it off , man ! Ahh ! - Cut it off ! - I ain 't touching that ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - It 's getting tighter . - I ain 't touching it ! I don 't want to touch it ! Touch the thing , man ! For God 's sake ! Don 't be ... God ! You 're making it worse ! Aah ! It 's tightening ! Aah ! It 's breaking my arm ! Ahh ! Shit ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! Cut it off ! - Shit ! - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! ! íÇ Åáåí ! íÇ Åáåí It 's in my suit ! It 's in my suit ! Oh , my God ! Shaw , you up ? Yeah . What 's up ? Alright , storm 's passed , but I can 't reach Millburn and Fifield on the com . I 'm taking a few men down and see if I can rustle them up . Okay . Uh ... any idea where they are ? Well , last time they radioed in , was just outside where you found your head . - Okay , we 're coming . - Right . Chance , you 're coming with me . Come on . Alright , boss . Ravel , did you fix that glitch ? No , Captain . It 's gotta be in the hard wire . What glitch , Captain ? One of them probes , picked up a lifeform . Pops up every hour or so for a couple of seconds , and it was gone . I can find the probe and fix it for you if you like . Knock yourself out . Be careful , doctors . Fifield ! Millburn ! Alright , come on down . David , are you alone ? Yes , Miss Vickers . - I 'd like your feed to my room . - Copy . You son of a bitch . You cut me off . What is this ? - Charlie ! - I just tripped . - Oh my god , you 're sick . - I 'm okay , baby . Come on . Fifield ! Millburn ! Hey , Chance . I wouldn 't touch that if I were you . - Dr. Shaw ? - Yeah ? Do we have any idea what is oozing out of these vases ? No , they weren 't like this last time we were here . Captain ! What ? Who is it ? Which one ? - Who is it ? - It 's Millburn . Eli . Don 't touch him ! Hold on ! Don 't touch him . - Eli ! Eli , honey . - Charlie , what 's wrong ? I ... I need you look at me , okay ? It won 't infect you , so , what do you see ? This is not good , baby . I want you to look at me and tell me what you see . Oh , my God ! Ford , get over here . It 's Okay . - Janek ? - What ? We have to do now ! What do you see , baby ? - We 've got a man down here , Shaw . - Honey , what do you see ? Huh ? Holloway 's sick ! He 's ... he 's not good . I see a movement in his esophagus . I 'm okay . Janek ! Come on and help me ! Ford ! Get over there ! What 's happening over there ? - I 'm okay ! - Let 's go ! Help me out ! It 'll be okay ! I got you ! We 're gonna get you out of here ! Prometheus , come in ! - Watch your head . - I 'm okay . Get him up ! Prometheus , come in ! Is anyone there ? This is Vickers . I need a medical team standing by the airlock . Call quarantine fail-safe , Holloway 's sick . - Sick with what ? - Just do it . Let 's get him back to the ship . We 're not safe down here . Charlie ? I 'm suiting up . - Charlie ! What 's going on ? Talk to me ! - Let 's move ! What was that thing back there ? Let 's go ! Let 's go ! Quickly ! We gotta move ! We gotta move ! He don 't look too good . Did he catch something down there ? - We had our helmets on . - I don 't know . Prometheus , this is Janek . - Make sure that back door is open . - Aye-aye , Captain . Oh , God ! I 'm so sorry ! Come on ! Please ! Prometheus ! why is that door not open ? Vickers , that is an order ! Get the goddamn door open ! I 'm sick ! Look at me , okay ! It 's too late . I 'm sick ! No , it 's not ! Come on ! - Ford , help me ! - Alright . Airlock Crew , if can hear me , this is Janek . Open that back door right now ! Hold that door ! Prometheus , do you copy ? Goddamn it , open this door ! That is an order ! Open it ! What the hell is this ? He 's not coming on board . Vickers , this is a sick man ! I can see that ! That 's why he 's not coming on my ship ! Charlie ! Chance , get over here ! Please ! We can still help him ! Help yourself . Everybody but Holloway back on this ship , now ! I won 't leave him ! Then stay ! - Wait a minute ! - Please ! We can contain him and put him on the medpod ! Please ! Don 't do this ! - It 's okay , Eli . - Vickers ! What are you doing ? - I love you , baby . I love you . - No ! - I 'm telling you , stay back ! - Don 't do this ! - No ! Don 't do this ! - Do it . - Stay back ! - No ! No , Charlie ! - Do it . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Charlie ! My deepest condolences . I 'm going to have to take this , it may be contaminated . If there 's a contagion , we were all exposed . You need to ... we need to run blood work on everyone who set foot in the pyramid . - Yes , of course . - Yes . I understand how inappropriate this is , given the circumstances . But as you ordered quarantine fail-safes , it 's my responsibility to ask , have you and Dr. Holloway had any intimate contact recently ? Since you and he were so close , I just want to be as thorough as possible . My , my . You 're pregnant . What ? From the look of it , three months so . No , that 's impossible . I can 't get pregnant . Did you have intercourse with Dr. Holloway ? Yes , but ten hours ago . There 's no bloody way I 'm three months pregnant . Well , doctor , it 's not exactly a traditional fetus . - I want to see it . - I don 't think that 's a good idea . David , I want to see it . Now , doctor . I want to see it . I want it out of me . I 'm afraid we don 't have the personnel , to perform a procedure like that . - Our best option ... - I want it out . Put you back into cryostasis . Please , get it out of me . Get it out of me ! Please ! It must be very painful . Here , let me give you something . That 's it . There , there . Someone will be alone shortly , to bring you back to cryotech . Must feel like your God abandoned you . What ? To lose Dr. Holloway , after your father died under such similar circumstances . What was it that killed him ? Ebola ? How do you ... how do you know that ? I watched your dreams . Dr. Shaw ? We 're here to put you in an anti-contaminatin suit , take you back to cryotech , go to beddy byes . Dr. Shaw ? She 's totally doped . Prepare her . Emergency procedure 's initiated . Please verbally state the nature of your injury . I need cesarean ! Error , this medpod is calibrated for male patients only . It does not offer the procedure you have requested . Please seek medical assistance elsewhere ... Surgery , abdominal , penetrating injuries , foreign body , initiate . Surgical procedure to begin . Running diagnostics . Oh , come on ! Get it out ! Come on ! Please ! Oh ! Oh , God ! - Oh ! Come on ! - Initiating anesthetics . Please ! Commence surgical procedure . Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! Come on ! Bridge - uh - to hanger . This is the captain . - Yes , captain . - Can you see what I 'm seeing ? Fifeild 's monitors have popped up . What ? Where ? Well , according to what I 'm looking at it 's right outside the goddamn ship . Barnes , Open the door ! Fifield ! Do you copy me ? Come on in ! Fifield ? Wait a second . Hey , Wallace . Take a look at this . Fifield ? What the hell is going on down there ? I 'm coming down . Chance . Suiting up . Come on . Don 't let him get on the ship ! Take him out ! You got it ! Do it ! Oh , my God ! Help me out here ! - You ready , Chance ? - Yes . Let 's go ! Clear the way ! We gotta get out of here ! Let 's go ! You 've been asleep . You 're on this ship all this time . Why ? Well , I have a few days of life left in me here . I didn 't wanna waste ' em , until I was sure that you could deliver what you promised . Meet my maker . Here we are , sir . Nice and clean . Haven 't you told him , they 're all gone ? But they 're not all gone , Dr. Shaw . One of them is still alive . We 're on our way to see him now . What ? Turn me around . You convinced me that ... if these things made us , then surely they can save us . My stick , please . They 'll save me , anyway . Save you ? From what ? Death , of course . Stand me up . I 'm alright , I 'm alright . I 'm alright . Yes , sir . You don 't understand . You don 't know . This place isn 't what we thought it was . They aren 't what we thought they were . I was wrong . We were so wrong ! Charlie ... Dr. Holloway is dead . We must leave ! And what would Charlie do now ? If we 're so close ... to answering the most meaningful questions , ever asked by mankind ? How can you leave without knowing what they are ? Or have you lost your faith , Shaw ? Okay . Come in . Where the hell you 're going , doc ? You know what this place is ? Those uh ... Engineers ? This ain 't their home . It 's an installation , maybe even military . They put it out here in the middle of nowhere , because they 're not stupid enough ... to make weapons of mass destruction on their own doorstep . That 's what all that shit ass in those vases . They made it here . They got out . They turned on them . The end . It 's time for us to go home . One of them is still alive . Don 't you wanna know what they have to say ? I don 't care . Right . All you do is fly the ship . That 's right . But you must care about something , captain . If you didn 't , why are you here ? How about this ... No matter what happens down there , I can 't bring none of that shit back home with us . Can 't let it happen . And I will do whatever I have to see that it doesn 't . Make sure you do , captain . You came after all . I thought you wanted me to . After all your vigorous attempts to stop me from coming here , I 'm just surprise to see you . Alright , David . Leave us now . Yes , sir . If you 're really going down there , you 're going to die . You have a negative way at looking at things . Exactly why you should have stayed at home . Did you really think I was going to sit in a boardroom for years , arguing over who was in charge while you go look ... for some miracle in some ... godforsaken rock in the middle of space ? A king has his reign , and then he dies . It 's inevitable . That is the natural order of things . Anything else ? No ... Father . That 's it . I didn 't think you had it in you . Sorry . Poor choice of words . Extraordinary survival instincts , Elizabeth . What happens when Weyland is not around to program you anymore ? I supposed I 'd be free . - You want that ? - " Want " ? Not a concept I 'm familiar with . That being said , doesn 't everyone want their parents dead ? I didn 't . Dr. Shaw . So pleased you can join us . You can take your helmet off if you like , sir . What ? The air is perfectly breathable . - You sure ? - Positive . Wait . We still don 't know how Holloway got infected . If it 's in the air ... It 's not . How do you know that ? Smells fine to me . - Shall we ? - Please . The bridge is just up ahead . What is this ? It 's a cargo hold . Janek . Are you seeing this ? - How many is there , Shaw ? - Thousands . What the hell ? Ravel . Give me those schematics . Putting it on the table now . Strip away the dome . Isolate that area . Bring it up . Bringing it up , captain . Enlarge that . Rotate it . That is a ship . Jesus Christ . It 's a goddamn ship . A superior species , no doubt . They are hyper sleep chambers . Well impress , I trust . So they were traveling somewhere ? I 've managed to work out the broad strips . it 's fairly evident they were in the process of leaving , before things went odd . Leaving to go where ? Earth . Why ? Sometimes to create , one must first destroy . - Where is he , David ? - This way , sir . Sure he 's alive ? Absolutely . - And you can speak to him ? - I believe I can . I 'm alright ! I 'm alright ! Speak to him , David . Tell him we came , like he asked . - Ask him where they are from . - What are you doing ? Ask him what 's in this cargo . It killed his people . Shaw ! Enough ! David . You made it here and it was meant for us . Why ? Shaw ! Enough ! For God 's sake shut her up ! Was it ... I need to know why ? What did we do wrong ? Why do you hate us ? If she opens her mouth again , shoot her ! David , continue . Tell him why I came . No ! Ford ! Now ! There 's ... nothing . I know . Have a good journey , Mr. Weyland . Time to go home . Mr. Chance . Take us home . Hey , captain . What the hell was that ? Prometheus ! Come in ! Shaw ? Is that you ? Copy ! Janek . Listen to me . - This ship is taking off ! - What ? What the hell is she talking about ? You can 't let it leave ! You have to stop it ! We 're not stopping anything , Shaw ! We 're going home ! Janek , if you don 't stop it , there won 't be any home to go back to ! It 's carrying death ! And it 's headed for Earth ! Shaw , this is not a warship . - I know . - Let 's go . I know that . But you must do it . Captain , let 's go ! Janek , please believe me ! Please ! I told you to get this ship going . Mr. Ravel . Warm up the ion propulsion . What the hell are you talking about ? Sir , burning the ion in the inner atmosphere ... Turns into a bullet . That is exactly the point . What the hell are you doing ? Janek , this is my ship ! I 'm telling you to take us home ! Vickers , I 'm going to eject your life support module into that surface . That 's two years of life . You want it or you want to stay with me ? You got 40 seconds to get to the escape pod . You 're crazy . Gentleman , I can handle this myself . Feel free to join Ms. Vickers . With all due respect , captain , you 're a shit pilot , and you 're going to need all the help you can get . " If you can 't be with the one you love . " If you think this means the bet 's off , you 're wrong . Why don 't you pay me on the other side ? Alirght . Get us as close as we can . Only got one shot at this . Lifeboats away ! Twenty seconds to evacuate . - Countdown initiated . - Ion propulsion is online . - 10 , 9 , 8 ... - Come on ! - 3 , 2 ... - Alright , gentlemen . Let 's do it ! Impact immanent Hands up ! Oh , God ! No ! Oh , no ! No ! No ! No ! ... Oh , God ! Warning ! You have two minutes of oxygen remaining . Warning ! You have 30 seconds of oxygen remaining . Airlock sealed . Oxygen levels now stabilizing . Elizabeth , are you there ? This is David . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm here . You need to get out . Immediately . He 's coming for you . - Whose coming ? - Airlock breached . Ah ! Die ! I 'm so sorry . Oh , God ! I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , Charlie . I can 't do it . I just can 't do it anymore . Elizabeth . Are you there ? Dr. Shaw ? Can you hear me ? Yes . Yes , I can hear you . I was afraid you were dead . You have no idea what afraid is . I know we 've had our differences , but please ... I need to ask you for your help . Why in hell would I help you ? Because , without me , you 'll never leave this place . Neither one of us is leaving this place . It 's not the only ship . There are many others . I can operate them . Dr. Shaw ? Dr. Shaw ! Over here ! Where 's my cross ? The pouch in my utility belt . Even after all this , you still believe ? Don 't you ? You said you can understand their navigation ? Use their maps ? Yes , of course . Once we get to one of their other ships , finding a path to Earth should be relatively straightforward . I don 't want to go back to where we came from . I want to go where they came from . You think you can do that , David . Yes . I believe I can . But may I ask what you hope to achieve by going there ? They created us . Then they tried to kill us . They changed their minds . I deserve to know why . The answer is irrelevant . Does it matter why they changed their minds ? Yes . Yes it does . I don 't understand . Well ... I guess that 's because I 'm human being , and you 're a robot . - I 'm sorry . - That 's quiet alright . Final report of the vessel Prometheus . This ship and her entire crew are gone . If you 're receiving this transmission , make no attempt to come to its point of origin . There 's only death here now , and I 'm leaving it behind . It is New Year 's Day . The year of Our Lord 2094 . My name is Elizabeth Shaw . Last survivor of the Prometheus , and I 'm still searching .

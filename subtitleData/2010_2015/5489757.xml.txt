Sorry to be so cold-hearted , but Mr. Freeze is stealing that ice . I was not expecting paprika . A-plus effort , honestly . Everyone , chill out ! Or Captain Cold will put you on ice . Come on ! I thought we had a schedule worked out . This is my day . I have a new assistant . I 'm still bringing him in . Everyone , stay cool ! It 's about to get downright to bone-chillin ' in here . Thanks to Icicle . I just walked into a cluster fuck . You guys , you have to try these salmon thingies . Focus , Captain Cold . Clearly there 's not room for three cold-themed villains with freeze rays . I guess you two Snow Jobs will have to change gimmicks , then . It 's not my gimmick .

I completely forgot about Chillblaine . You and America , buddy . It took me six years of research to build my freeze ray . How do you high school dropouts keep making them .

Well , those villains are going to the cooler , thanks to Ice and her amazing freeze powers . Cool . I 'm glad you guys could come all the way to Earth-C . Me and Captain Carrot didn 't see eye to eye on a lot of things but ... no one deserves to die like that . I never met the Captain or his " Zoo Crew " , but ... since you vouch for him , I 'm glad to be here in their time of need . Why didn 't you tell me they look like cartoons . Wait . I 'm good . Dammit . Sorry . If you can 't keep it together , you need to leave . I know , I know ! For the love of ... It 's a turtle wearing goggles . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I 'm ... I 'm sorry .

Now , let 's see what the joker ... Oh my god , no ! Like a string of firecrackers , my fucking back . I felt the soles of my feet touch the back of my head on that one . That 's Bane . And now , " Real characters from the DC Universe " . - Hey there , I 'm Firestorm . - Can you believe it , folks ? Take a good look at this douche . I 'm ... Firestorm . The nuclear man .

" Real characters from the DC Universe " . - What are we doing here , Lantern . - What 's the matter ? You 're a little rusty with the ladies ? If anyone 's gonna score tonight , it 's the man of steel . Haven 't you been courting Lois Lane for like fifteen years . - Do you ever score ? - Watch and learn . Hey ladies , you look like you could use a non-threatening guy pal who would never push your boundaries . And while you 're at it , could you co-sign my loan for a late model Corolla ? Got a pen ? Not even I could get to the friend zone that fast . Class is in session , people . Soon as I get this suit off . Hold on there , money bags . You gotta do it in costume . Yeah , that 's the rules . We all have to be in costume . What ? I 'm dressed like a giant bat . Well , fuck you guys . I 'm getting wasted . Got a couple Piña Coladas here . Just for the ladies . Looks like you could use some just for men . And you bitches can pay for your own drinks . Name 's Aquaman , I know how to talk to tuna . Martian Manhunter ? What are you doing ? I have a life outside the team , you know . - You are the worst . - Aquaman got manhunted . I 'm outta here . There 's plenty of fish in the sea . Did he mean that metaphorically or ... ? I do not just call when I 've been drinking . Meanwhile , at the Legion of Doom . And this new plan will crush the Justice League once and for all . But more importantly , it 's time to draw names , for secret santa . It 's team building , people . Shake it up , shake it up . I got Leonard Snart . Who 's Leonard Snart ? Is he the kid in the mail room with the B.O. ? Everyday I 'm like , " I smell the mail coming ! " and sure enough ... I 'm Leonard Snart . How could I forget ? I think that kid 's name is Glenn . Somebody is going to get a big surprise . A new rule this year everybody . No exploding toys I 'm literally the only one affected by that rule . I still have a scar in my forehead from Christmas 2004 , you dumb butthole . It 's ... It 's how I express love . Has everyone drawn a name ? God , what smells like a turd lovers pizza ? Hey guys , we doin secret Santa again this year ? Non noncommittal mumbling . The gift that keeps on giving . I have a glandular condition , you guys . This is not my fault . You think I don 't try ? I shower everyday . I shower everyday . Learn more about Glenn and his battle against body odor , right after these commercial messages . Ladies and Gentlemen , I don 't know how to break this news in any way that make sense of it , so I 'll just give you the facts as I have them . Glenn killed himself during the commercial break . My God , What was that ? I don 't know but I 'll find out Mr. Jordan . This is so cool . Not quite " Independence Day " cool , but much cooler than " Battle Los Angeles " cool . If Battle Los Angeles was zero cool and Independence Day was 10 cool then this would be about a 7 cool . I am Abin Sur . It 's a 9 cool . - From the Green Lantern ... - Exposition Youpi ! - The ring , the cosmic ring ... - Oh my gosh , oh my gosh . ... has chosen you as its new master , Al Jordan . Last words spoken in its native tongue . We 'll tragically never know what Al Jordan means in English . Watch this ring is glowing and seems to be taking over my body . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey ! OK , OK . Could you please stop screaming ? Thank you . You will be trained to use your ring by Kilowog . It 's like scratching a chalkboard against another chalkboard . If you are attacked , the ring will respond to your thoughts and imagination to protect you . Begin . Cool , I dodged it . Protect me , Selena Gomez . I meant weapons , you Poozer . I am not sure that the earthlings are worthy of our ring . - Make them kiss . - Yes , it is hot in here . Let 's just hope they gave Abin Sur the burial he deserved . Your enhanced strength and criptonized lasers make you a match for even Superman , Mr. Luthor . Yes , a flawless design . Tyler , I told you not to play ball in here . I 'm so sorry Mr. Luthor , it 's my day to watch him ... Just stop talking for one second . That tickles . But , what 's going on here ? OK , just to be completely clear . All we gonna do is go over to the Hall of Justice , plant a nega-bomb and kill them all at once . That 's it , right . Exactly , and we 're sneaking over at night when it 's dark like Sinestro said , great idea " N 'estro " . And it never hurts to leave a few riddles with embedded clues on how to diffuse the bomb . Right , gang ? Look , Eddy . We 're not doing the riddle thing anymore . You don 't have to get your dick prince over everything we do . Without my riddles , they might as well not even show up . Fine . Riddle me this . Witch losers are gonna be totally jealous when I defeat the JLA without them . It 's you , guys . Riddle me this . Who is the punctuation posse ? Perhaps I can answer your question . Riddler . Intense emotion do I hear ? Then the Exclamer must be near . The Exclamer ? Wait , can we have a pause here for a second ? Pausing is my game , Flash . And The Coma is my name . Forget it . I 'm shutting down this turd factory before it gets any worse Did someone use a quote yet , we can 't hear . Jack ( bip ) back here . So if we just turn off the light when we leave the room ... Wait , they said Bane had crippled me for life , but that monster isn 't going to own me . I 'm back . Oh my god , this is not happening ! Where were you guys on that one ? You just watched it . This is a waking nightmare That 's Bane . Oh , come on , guys , I 've had this since I was thirteen . Riddle me this Mirror Master . What 's pink , quivering and needs a shave ? Two things : Sinestro and Sinestro 's vagina . - Let 's go . - OK OK , I 've got to do it . - Call 991 , guys . - I 'm not so fan of blood . We 'll need more TP here , fellas . - I 'm out of here . - Help me , help me . Riddle me this , what 's covered in question marks , sniffs clue and was never here . Meanwhile at the Hall of Justice Maybe the crew ship wouldn 't sink if they didn 't shove a quarter tons of self-loathing in the every cabin . How they even wipe themselves ? Someone said crew ship like in the ocean ? Why didn 't you invite me ? To tell the fish to get out of the way . No , they figured out . - Nice one , Superman . - Sorry guys , bad news . The toilet still clogged . That was an ancient relic passed down from my ancestors . Your ancestors didn 't know crap about plumbing . I got friends coming over tonight .

 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . I didn 't come home alone . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on extant : Kryger : I 'm sorry , molly . I can 't let you stand in the way . Harmon ! No ... Harmon ! Girl : He wants you to help him . If you take him , I can come , too . Don 't shoot me ! I know where your family is . My family is at home . No , they 're not . Oh , my god . Stop ! He needs him . Don 't worry , daddy . Everything is going to be fine . Director sparks is out there somewhere with your baby . I want you to bring it back to me . With everything you 've done to me ? John , sparks is out there with the baby . Yasumoto is gonna send somebody with me . I just wish you 'd come to me instead . I know . I 'm sorry . Be careful . I will . Sorry . I 'm gonna need to take that . We don 't want anyone tracking us . We need to talk . Of course . I-I just spoke to my wife . She said that you 've sent someone to go with her T-t-to meet this thing . Yes . Dr. Mason . He 's extremely capable . Tha-that 's not the point . I come to you for help . I-I-I tell you about this ... Situation , The danger of this thing , And you sent my wife off t-to meet it ? It 's her child . It 's half her child . Yet she sees it as her child . She saw it in the ultrasound . It has a human form . That 's not the half I 'm worried about . The decision was not mine alone . Molly has her own opinion in the matter . She 's not thinking rationally . You helped an emotionally fragile woman Put herself in danger . I think ethan and I had better go . I wish you wouldn 't . As you indicated , Alan sparks is still out there . And , thanks to you , so is my wife . As I said , dr . Mason is a worthy companion . I 'd feel so much better with you and ethan here . Your safety is important to me . And , of course , to molly . Big-picture people , They lose sight of what really matters . What does that mean ? I think that yasumoto went about all this In completely the wrong way . We 'll bring your baby back . And it won 't be a lab-rat situation this time . It 'll be done on your terms . Thank you . So , you were doing bio-research on the seraphim ? Worms . ( chuckles softly ) Viability in orbit ? Exactly . Everybody thinks the answers are out there . We have all the proof we need right in front of us . I was just down in caracas . Found these microfossils embedded in meteorites , With all the biomarkers of terrestrial cyanobacteria . I mean , these life forms , they 're coming to us . We don 't need to go to them . I can 't imagine what this must mean to you . Finally getting a chance to see your child . ( labored breathing ) woman : Ma 'am ? Ma 'am , look at me . Focus . Breathe . The baby 's crowning now . I 'm gonna need suction . Ma 'am , what is your name ? Molly ... ( groans ) Oh . Oh , god . I 'm seven-months pregnant . It is too soon , it 's too soon ... Molly , listen to me . You 're going to have your baby now . You don 't have time to make it to a hospital . I need you to work with me , okay ? Okay , okay , okay . Oh , god . Marcus ! Marcus ! Marcus ! Oh , no , no ! No ! Marcus ! No ! No , no , no , no , no , no ... Molly , I need you to focus . No ! Look at me . Your baby 's coming . Push ! Marcus ! Hey , honey . I hate to have to tell you this . The baby didn 't make it . We tried everything we could . He was just ... Too little . " he " ? It was a boy ? I 'm so sorry . No . Oh , god . No , no , no . Oh , sweetheart , come here . No ... No . We 're about halfway there . Another hour , maybe . Tops . Anya ? The last time we were here , she was seven . I remember she fell in trying to grab a lily pad . You were so worried she 'd get an infection . It 's not fair , alan , bringing me back here . ( sniffles ) I brought mrs . Wimberley 's truck . My car barely made it up the hill . Anya , after you see what I want to show you If you still want to go , I promise I 'll bring you back . You sure ? Drones don 't lie . This is anya sparks 's car . Sparks must have figured out someone could find it . Had her meet him here , picked her up . Yeah , the drones didn 't think of that . Now what do you want to do ? They must be hiding someplace in these hills . Well , you used to be a cop . Time to act like one . It looks like a kidnapping case . This man took a small child . You should talk to sheriff dugan when he gets back . Sheriff dugan is currently on a call . You can wait around for him , if you 'd like . When do you expect him ? Any minute , unless he stopped off For a burger at jay jay 's . It 's not every day We get to host a couple of feds . We 'll check back later . Coming ? Alan , why did you drag me up here ? It won 't make any sense if I tell you . I just have to show you . This ... This place has too many memories . I never should have come . Please , Anya . You 've come this far already . You know me . I 've never had the kind of faith that helped with anything . But seeing this ... Just promise me you 'll give it a chance . Give what a chance ? Okay , enough . Mommy . Sparks : She 's real . It 's not possible . You can touch her . It 's not possible . I was gone But now I 'm back . Oh ! Sheriff dugan , There were two federal agents here About a kidnapping . They should still be in town If you 'd like to try and find them . A kidnapping ? Your drone footage from the wimberley woods Shows a man who matches their description Of the kidnapper . I 've notified nancy . And if you 'd like , I can cross ... ( gunshot ) What 'd you want to go and do that for , dugan ? I 'm gonna need a bin number for the requisition form If it 's not blown all to crap . ( grunting ) Mason : Nobody gets it , do they ? Gets what ? The miracle of all this . Life ... Somewhere else in the universe . Life that we can ... I mean ... You had a child with it . So , what was it like ? Your encounter . I guess the reason I 'm asking is I 've heard some pretty hairy stories . It must 've been terrifying . ( quiet laugh ) No . It wasn 't . ( laughs ) I 'm sorry . I mean , if this is hard to talk about . I just , I-I want to know what to expect . No . It 's-it 's not hard . I saw someone . He died a very long time ago . And-and just to see him again was ... Well , it was beautiful . This was marcus dawson ? From the academy ? He , uh ... Died in a car accident , right ? I 'm sorry . Yasumoto gave me your file . I read through it on the flight . Yeah . It was him . You see , that 's the real miracle here . The fact that they can bring back The people that you 've lost . Well , I didn 't just lose him . I lost our baby in that same crash . I 'm sorry . That 's , um ... That 's tough . And I think that 's exactly why he came to me . It 's not just that we get to see the people that we lost . ( stammers ) It 's like we get to start again . You know , we-we-we get to go down a new path . If that is your child 's gift , To guide us down these alternate pathways , Then this is truly what I 've always dreamt of seeing . A moment of punctuated equilibrium . An evolutionary leap forward . Your child could be that leap . ( quiet laugh ) Well , you know ... You know , I 'm not one of these blue marble ladies . So ... " blue marble ladies " ? Well , you know , astronauts go to space And they see the earth and ... It looks like a big , beautiful blue marble . And then they start to think That everything is all peace and love . ( laughs ) Well , the universe doesn 't care about us or our survival , So I never bought into any of that . I mean , 99.9 % of every species That has ever existed has now gone extinct . Cheerful world view . My point is we care about our survival Even against those odds . We 're still here . I mean , that 's what evolution is , right ? Maybe ... Every bad thing that 's happened Is just a result of him trying to live , Trying to protect himself . Exactly . And that 's why we need a different approach . ( engines humming nearby ) We should get going . You ready ? We 'll take the check . Woman : Right away . Thank you . Kryger : When you get out of town , there could be 20 miles Of forest in every direction . We know sparks made it this far . And traveling with the offspring , This forest is as good a place to hide as any . The drones should be able to give us a location soon . We can 't wait for that . He could be moving . Well , if you want to poke around the woods On your own , be my guest . Or we could just ask him . Man you 're looking for , I know where he is . Come with me . Just the two of you Working this alone ? We work out of the anderson office . Call came in , we headed right out . When it involves a child , you can 't be too careful . Anderson ? You know steve tillman ? Steve ? Yeah . Good man . You hear that ? Loose contactor . I got to pull over . I 'm just gonna take a look . Contactor 's in the back . ( foliage ruffling nearby ) We always knew ... Intelligent people knew That we weren 't the only thinking , Feeling beings in the universe . And this Is what you found ? We aimed our ships towards something . And this is what happened . But how does it do ... What it does ? I don 't know . It 's half human . It seems to be able to find them for us . The people we 've lost . Connect us to them . Bring them back . We need to keep it safe . Not just so that katie can stay with us , But so that everyone can have this gift . Mommy ? Yes ? You won 't make me go back to that dark place , Where dead people go ? It was lonely there . No , darling . I won 't ever let you go back there . Never . How long till mom comes back ? She should be done with her research And meeting us at home soon . As long as we 're here , there are a few diagnostics I want to run down in the lab . Will odin be there ? You two really seem to be hitting it off , huh ? I like him . He knows about things . Man : I 'm sorry , sir . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have To ask you to remain here . Heat sensors , huh ? Mr. Yasumoto gave explicit instructions . Until the immediate threat is contained , He really doesn 't think it 's a good idea For you to leave the office . We were just going to run downstairs to my lab . What 's an immediate threat ? Nothing . Just a misunderstanding Mr. Yasumoto is helping us clear up . That 's right , son . Just a misunderstanding . It 's just so much easier for us to keep an eye On you up here . I 'm sure you can understand . It 's for your safety . Please . ( birds chirping ) Just the two of us , right ? You 're taking me to meet him ? Of course . That 's the idea here . And that 's it ? We get your baby . We bring the two of you back . Then mr . Yasumoto puts all of his resources At your disposal . What ... ? Something 's wrong . I know it 's hard to get back trust Once it 's been broken , but ... It 's trying to send me a message . Uh , those trucks that passed the diner , Where were they going ? I really don 't know what you 're talking about . ( birds squawking ) You had better stop this car . Something 's wrong . Listen , molly , I understand . You have every reason to be cautious . But you have to believe me when I ... Take a seat anywhere you want . I 'll be with you in a sec . Can I use your phone , please ? Weren 't you just in here ? Yes , but I 'm having an emergency . I need to call my husband . Please . Fine . Thank you . You can have some privacy up there . Okay . If you do that , you 're going to lose in three moves . You learned fast . It 's simple . ( phone ringing ) Mom ? Hi , ethan . I learned how to play chess . Molly : That 's great . Can you give dad the phone , please ? Okay . Ethan , can you please put dad on the phone ? I need to talk to him in private . Is it another secret ? I need to talk to him About something , okay ? Is this about me ? No . It is not about ... Ethan . Can you please , please just give dad the phone ? Come on . Hey . What 's going on ? Okay , look . John , I don 't have A lot of time , okay ? So listen . The man I 'm with , dr . Mason , The baby doesn 't want me to be with him . Okay ? I have no idea why , And it really doesn 't matter right now , But he sent a flock of birds To attack him so I could get away . John ... I am not having a good feeling about this right now . I really think you and ethan should get out of there . Is this something to do with yasumoto ? I don 't know . But if it does , you shouldn 't be there . Hey . You got to go . Someone 's looking for you . Okay . John , I gotta go . Hurry . Thank you . ( gasps ) oh ! Sorry . This is for your own good . Come on . ( sighs ) Have you played this before ? My dad just showed me . It 's easy . Well , people don 't think so . You just have to look at the connections . Nothing serious , I hope . Oh . Alan ! Anya : I can 't find her . She 's gone . No , no , no , no . She 's not gone . I 'll take care of this . Just wait here . I 'll take care of it , anya . Katie ? Kate ? Katie . Katie : Daddy ? You 're here . Molly 's coming . What ? When ? He needs your help to complete his mission . He needs you to get molly to do something that has to be done . Far away . I 'm not sure I understand . He needs to do something to her , And he needs to be stronger to do it . Stronger ? He 's going to need To feed again . Like what he did with that sheriff . You won 't see me again Unless you help him . ( coughing ) I 'm all right . It comes and goes . You have to pull it together . We don 't have time for you to detox . If you go soft , I 'll leave you . That 's why I left molly . I thought you said you got split up . ( sighs ) You left her in there to die ? I didn 't have any choice . You didn 't see what it made me see . Well , did it make you leave a friend to die , Or was that your call ? I don 't know what you imagine . Some kind of second coming or the care And feeding of your new pet alien . Either way , you don 't have a clue . That thing has to be stopped . ( rustling nearby ) Connections must have come loose . I really appreciate this . Yeah , rough roads out here , man . Happens all the time . Uh , my wallet 's just inside . Oh , we got a pot of coffee on . I bet you 'd like a cup . Yes , I would . ( muffled screaming ) ( muffled screaming continues ) Is this what it takes for it to do what it does ? ( muffled screaming ) There are two kinds of feedings . I bring it food , and it seems to grow At an exceptional rate . And then there 's this . ( muffled screaming ) What its other half needs . They don 't die , but they are different after . You try to make your peace with it . Mommy . Look what I made . ( muffled screaming ) Everything comes at a cost . We can have our katie back . I don 't care about the rest . ( muffled screaming ) ( indistinct radio chatter ) I promise you , They 're just here as a backup . We just want to make sure we do this right . You go in there with all these guys , It 's not gonna go right . I hope you told them to say good-bye to their families . Molly , I 'm not the enemy here . I care about exactly what you care about . ( sighs ) Look , I 'm sorry about this . I really believe that this is the best way to do it . With force and more armed men ? I don 't think that 's the way to do it . Like I said before , it 's just a contingency . Molly . Your baby ... It 's half yours And half this ... Other . And yes , it 's trying to protect you . And yes , it wants you , but this other ... Frankly , it would be presumptuous To believe that it thinks like we do . Because he wants to live ? And needs his mother ? I guess I 'm presumptuous . And I guess I 'm cautious . Look , we both want the same thing . We both want to keep your baby safe . I 'll keep my baby safe . Anya : " ' I won 't , ' said alice . " ' off with her head ! " the queen shouted " at the top of her voice . Nobody moved . " ' who cares for you ? " said alice . " she had grown to her full size by this time . Both : 'you 're nothing but a pack of cards ! ' " ( laughs ) Anya : " at this point , " the whole pack rose up into the air " and they came flying down on her . She gave a little scream , half of fright ... " She 's here . It 's time . Go talk to your offspring . You want to meet your son ? Go ahead . He 's waiting . ( steady beeping ) So , you 're doing fine . No permanent damage was done . Marcus is in intensive care . But the bleeding 's stopped . He 's tough . He 's gonna pull through . Good . The baby ? ( crying ) Right there . ( chuckles ) It was close for a while , but he 's a tough one , too , And he 's doing great . ( chuckles ) Do you want to touch him ? Come on . I 'll help you up . Come on . You 're doing good . Here we go . Aw . Oh , my gosh . This is what you always dreamed of seeing . You 're beautiful . I 'm gonna let the two of you get acquainted . I 'm gonna come back and check on you later , okay ? Okay . Hi . ( gurgling ) ( chuckles ) Hi . Hi , little guy . You 're just beautiful . ( birds chirping ) ( man groaning ) ( continues groaning ) Please . Please . You 'd better hold tight , 'cause the second You let me go , I 'll kill you ! I 'll kill both of you ! You know who we 're looking for . I know . I know ! Tell us where he is . You want to find him ? ( panting ) : Yeah ... I 'm happy to tell you . Yeah ... He 'd want to find you . He 'd be happy to meet you . ( continues panting ) How are you doing ? I 'm okay . ( sighs ) I want to apologize to you . For what ? Well ... ( sighs ) ... Sometimes when you 're a father ... It 's ... Difficult to admit to yourself That your kids are growing up . That they have minds of their own . That they 're their own people . Because that means someday they won 't need you . You 're growing up- - And that , more than anything , is what I want for you . It 's just ... I was having trouble with it for a while . You 've acted like You 're mad at me a lot lately . And I 'm really sorry for that . Here it is . I 'm going to ask you to do something That 's very hard And very grown-up . Okay ? Mr. Yasumoto doesn 't want us To leave this place . Why doesn 't he want us to leave ? I don 't know . But I need you to go find julie , Tell her this and tell her To get you out of the building . How am I gonna get downstairs ? I 'm gonna have to turn down your warmers , So you can get past the sensors . It 'll be okay for as long as It takes you to get downstairs . Once you are in the lab , Just ask julie to turn them back on . I know how to turn them on myself . Wow . ( laughs ) I guess you do . You really think I can do this ? I knowyou can do this . Are you ready ? ( medical device beeping steadily , baby cooing ) ( door slams shut , alarm sounds ) Female voice ( over p.A. ) : Warning . Oxygen flow restricted . ( baby crying ) Heart rate decreasing . Warning . No . No . Immediate action required . No , no , no . ( monitor rapidly beeping ) ( baby continues crying ) let me out ! ( screaming ) : Help ! Let me out ! ( whimpering ) : Somebody help ! Oh ! ( over p.A. ) : Molly , it 's ben . I 'm here to help . Ben ? There 's nothing to worry about . It 's an rds issue that just needs A ventilation adjustment . I can walk you through the procedure . Okay . O-okay , ben . Tell me what to do . It 's just some code . I 'll dictate- - you enter . It 's going to be fine . Ben : Start with your access code . Okay . Okay . Okay . Then your operation code . It 's going to be fine . Good . Now ... P-thred ... Underscore exit ... And you 're done . Okay . The code has been accepted . ( sighs ) Congratulations , molly . Your baby is going to be fine . Oh . Oh , god . ( baby cooing , molly sighs ) ( rumbling , glass clinking ) what was that , ben ? Ben : There 's been a remote adjustment to our course . It was a debris avoidance protocol Ordered by an isea admin . Mm . Next time , maybe a little heads-up ? What 's the new course ? Actually , we 're headed towards earth . But don 't get your hopes up . It 's only temporary . Funny . ( clears throat ) excuse me . Dr. Woods . I , uh ... ( chuckles ) I had a little issue with ethan I wanted to tell you about . Everything 's okay , I hope ? Uh , well , he 's been acting sort of moody . First , I thought it was a programming problem , but , uh , Then , uh- - you 're-you 're gonna appreciate this , Ms. Dodd- - uh , it was a kid thing , you know , something I had to fix with patience , not-not with , uh , parts . I don 't know if-if you 've run into this sort of thing In your work . The employees Who needed to be given more responsibilities , who Stopped thriving without those responsibilities ... Most people truly need their independence , or The illusion of it , to thrive . John : That 's exactly my point . I mean , I 'm not sure , with ethan anyway , That the illusion would be enough . ( birds singing ) ( whooshing ) ( elevator bell dings ) Hey , little guy . What 's going on ? I need to find julie . We 're in trouble . Okay , well , she 's already left . I can take you to her . Is this like big " t " trouble or little " t " trouble ? Big , I think . Okay , we better go , then , right ? You can tell me about the big " t " on the way . ( elevator bell dings ) ( beep , elevator bell dings ) I put the offspring in the car . Molly 's given us what we need . We have to go . For molly ? No . It 's better if we bring her . He wants his mom . I need you to put molly in the car . They must be in there . We blow the propane tank under the cabin And burn this thing to the ground . You still don 't get it , do you ? It keeps getting stronger and stronger . It has to be stopped . That is not your call to make . ( door opening ) Molly . You shoot me if you have to . I have to make this right . ( guns cocking ) Let her go ! ( echoing ) : Let her go ! I said , let her go ! Something 's wrong . Where-where ... Where 's my baby ? I want my baby ! ( gunfire ) ( groaning ) ( panting ) harmon ? ( gunshot , molly gasps ) Harmon . Oh , god . Oh , god . Breathe . Breathe . The baby 's not here . Molly , it used you to get here for a reason . It 's getting stronger . You brought it here . You have to stop it . ( panting ) uh ... Harmon . Harmon ! Harmon ! Oh , god . Oh , god . Harmon . Harmon . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

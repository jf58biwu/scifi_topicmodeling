( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) There 's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop ... CHRISTINE : Sorry , Mr. Stark , do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared , despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards ? STARK : Yes . CHRISTINE : And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle ... STARK : I know that it 's confusing . It is one thing to question the official story , and another thing entirely to make wild accusations , or insinuate that I 'm a superhero . I mean , let 's face it , I 'm not the heroic type .

And I 'm gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world . - Make sure you join me ... - All right , it 's a zoo out there , watch out . - Open up , let 's go . - STARK : Hey !

( TONY CLEARS THROAT ) - What are you up to later ? - Serving subpoenas . Yikes . He doesn 't like to be handed things . - Yeah , I have a peeve . - I got it . You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 : 00 a.m. - Can I see a badge ? - You wanna see the badge ? He likes the badge . - You still like it ? - Yep . - How far are we from D.C. ? - D.C. ? 250 miles . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( GAVEL BANGING ) STERN : Mr. Stark , could we pick up now where we left off ? - ( BANGING GAVEL ) - Mr. Stark . Please . - Yes , dear ? - Can I have your attention ? Absolutely . Do you or do you not possess a specialized weapon ? - I do not . - You do not ? I do not . Well , it depends on how you define the word " weapon . " - The Iron Man weapon . - My device does not fit that description . Well ... How would you describe it ? I would describe it by defining it as what it is , Senator . - As ? - It 's a high-tech prosthesis . ( ALL LAUGHING ) That is ... That is ... That 's actually the most apt description I can make of it . It 's a weapon . It 's a weapon , Mr. Stark . Please , if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen ... My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people - of the United States of America . - Well , you can forget it . I am Iron Man . The suit and I are one . To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself , which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution , depending on what state you 're in . - You can 't have it . - Look , I 'm no expert ... In prostitution ? Of course not . You 're a senator . Come on . ( ALL LAUGHING ) I 'm no expert in weapons . We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons . I 'd now like to call Justin Hammer , our current primary weapons contractor . Let the record reflect that I observed Mr. Hammer entering the chamber , and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) ( LAUGHS ) Absolutely . I 'm no expert . I defer to you , Anthony . You 're the wonder boy . Senator , if I may . I may well not be an expert , but you know who was the expert ? Your dad . Howard Stark . Really a father to us all , and to the military-industrial age . Let 's just be clear . He was no flower child . He was a lion . We all know why we 're here . In the last six months , Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities . And yet he insists it 's a shield . He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it . I wish I were comforted , Anthony , I really do . I 'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house , but this ain 't Canada . You know , we live in a world of grave threats , threats that Mr. Stark will not always be able to foresee . Thank you . God bless Iron Man . God bless America . That is well said , Mr. Hammer . The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber . Rhodey ? What ? Hey , buddy . I didn 't expect to see you here . Look , it 's me , I 'm here . Deal with it . Let 's move on . I just ... RHODES : Drop it . STARK : All right , I 'll drop it . STERN : I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon , compiled by Colonel Rhodes . And , Colonel , for the record , can you please read page 57 , paragraph four ? You 're requesting that I read specific selections - from my report , Senator ? - Yes , sir . It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner . I understand . A lot of things have changed today . - So if you could just read ... - You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect - the summary of my final ... - Just read it , Colonel . I do . Thank you . Very well . " As he does not operate within any definable branch of government , " Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation " and to her interests . " I did , however , go on to summarize that the benefits of Iron Man - far outweigh the liabilities . - Uh ... Uh ... Uh ... - And that it would be in our interest ... - That 's enough , Colonel . - ... to fold Mr. Stark ... - That 's enough . ... into the existing chain of command , Senator . I 'm not a joiner , but I 'll consider Secretary of Defense , if you ask nice . - ( PEOPLE LAUGHING ) - We can amend the hours a little bit . I 'd like to go on and show , if I may , the imagery that 's connected to your report . I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images - to the general public at this time . - STERN : With all due respect , Colonel , I understand . And if you could just narrate those for us , we 'd be very grateful . Let 's have the images . Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are , in fact , attempts at making manned copies of Mr. Stark 's suit . This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground , indicating that these suits are quite possibly , at this moment , operational . Hold on one second , buddy . Let me see something here . Oh ! Boy , I 'm good . I commandeered your screens . I need them . Time for a little transparency . - Now , let 's see what 's really going on . - What is he doing ? If you will direct your attention to said screens ... I believe that 's North Korea . ( MAN CHATTERING ON TV ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ON TV ) Can you turn that off ? Take it off . Iran . ( MAN SHOUTING ON TV ) No grave immediate threat here . Is that Justin Hammer ? How did Hammer get in the game ? STARK : Justin , you 're on TV . Focus up . ( PEOPLE MURMURING ) HAMMER : Okay , give me a left twist . Left 's good . Turn to the right . ( MAN SCREAMING ON TV ) HAMMER : Oh , Shit . Oh , Shit ! STARK : Wow . Yeah , I 'd say most countries , five , 10 years away . Hammer Industries , 20 . I 'd like to point out that that test pilot survived . STERN : I think we 're done , is the point that he 's making . ( STUTTERS ) I don 't think there 's any reason ... - The point is , you 're welcome , I guess . - STERN : For what ? Because I 'm your nuclear deterrent . It 's working . We 're safe . America is secure . You want my property ? You can 't have it . But I did you a big favor . I 've successfully privatized world peace . What more do you want ? For now ! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns . ( BLEEP ) you , Mr. Stark . ( BLEEP ) you , buddy . We 're adjourned . We 're adjourned for today . - Okay . - You 've been a delight . ( MAN ON TV TRANSLATING IN RUSSIAN ) My bond is with the people . And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself . If there 's one thing I 've proven it 's that you can count on me to pleasure myself . ( POWER SURGING ) ( SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO PLAYING ON STEREO ) Wake up . Daddy 's home . JARVIS : Welcome home , sir . Congratulations on the opening ceremonies . They were such a success , as was your Senate hearing . And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on , sir . ( CHUCKLES ) You ! I swear to God I 'll dismantle you . I 'll soak your motherboard . I 'll turn you into a wine rack . ( POWERING DOWN ) How many ounces a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink ? We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms , sir . Check palladium levels . Blood toxicity , 24 % . It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition . Another core has been depleted . God , they 're running out quick . I have run simulations on every known element , and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core . You are running out of both time and options . ( EXHALES ) Unfortunately , the device that 's keeping you alive is also killing you . Miss Potts is approaching . - I recommend that you inform her ... - STARK : Mute . - Uh-uh . - Is this a joke ? - What are you thinking ? - What ? - ( ANGRILY ) What are you thinking ? - Hey , I 'm thinking I 'm busy . And you 're angry about something . Do you have the sniffles ? I don 't wanna get sick . - Did you just donate ... - Keep your business . ... our entire modern art collection to the ... - Boy Scouts of America . - ... Boy Scouts of America ? Yes . It is a worthwhile organization . I didn 't physically check the crates but , basically , yes . And it 's not " our " collection , it 's my collection . No offense . No , you know what ? I think I 'm actually entitled to say " our " collection considering the time that I put in , over 10 years , - curating that . - It was a tax write-off . I needed that . You know , there 's only about 8,011 things - that I really need to talk to you about . - Dummy . Hey , stop spacing out . The Bridgeport 's already machining that part . The Expo is a gigantic waste of time . I need you to wear a surgical mask until you 're feeling better . - Is that okay ? - That 's rude . There 's nothing more important to me than the Expo . It 's my primary point of concern . - I don 't know why you 're ... - The Expo is your ego gone crazy . Wow . Look at that . That 's modern art . That 's going up . - Oh , you 've got to be kidding . - I 'm gonna put this up right now . - This is vital . - Stark is in complete disarray . - You understand that ? - No . Our stocks have never been higher . - Yes , from a managerial standpoint . - You are ... Well , if it 's messy , - then let 's double back . - Let me give you an example . - Let 's move on to another subject . - Oh , no , no , no , no . You are not taking down the Barnett Newman - and hanging that up ! - I 'm not taking it down . I 'm just replacing it with this . - Let 's see what I can get going here . - Okay , fine . My point is , we have already awarded contracts - to the wind farm people . - Yeah . Don 't say " wind farm . " - I 'm already feeling gassy . - And to the plastic plantation tree , which was your idea , by the way . Those people are on payroll ... - Everything was my idea . - ... and you won 't make a decision . I don 't care about the liberal agenda anymore . It 's boring . Boring . I 'm giving you a boring alert . - You do it . - I do what ? Excellent idea . I just figured this out . You run the company . - Yeah , I 'm trying to run the company . - Pepper , I need you to run the company . - Well , stop trying to do it and do it . - You will not - give me the information ... - I 'm not asking you to try ... - ... in order to ... - I 'm asking you to physically do it . I need you to do it . - I am trying to do it . - Pepper , you 're not listening to me ! - No , you are not listening to me . - I 'm trying to make you CEO . Why won 't you let me ? - Have you been drinking ? - Chlorophyll . I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries , effective immediately . Yeah , done deal . Okay ? I 've actually given this a fair amount of thought , believe it or not . Doing a bit of headhunting , so to speak , trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be . And then I realized it 's you . It 's always been you . I thought there 'd be a legal issue , but actually I 'm capable of appointing my successor . My successor being you .

His son , Ivan , who is also a physicist , was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan , and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison . No further records exist . Tony , you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now . Listen . I 've been on the phone with the National Guard all day , trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH , knocking down your front door and taking these . They 're gonna take your suits , Tony , okay ? They 're sick of the games . You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years . Well , guess what ? Somebody else had it yesterday . It 's not theoretical anymore . Are you listening to me ? - Are you okay ? - ( GRUNTS SOFTLY ) Let 's go . - ( TONY GASPS ) - Hey , man . Hey , hey ! - You all right ? - Yeah , I should get to my desk . ( GASPS ) - See that cigar box ? - Yeah . It 's palladium . ( TONY GROANING ) - Is that supposed to be smoking ? - If you must know , it 's neutron damage . It 's from the reactor wall . You had this in your body ? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck ? Road rash . Thank you . ( TONY SIGHING ) - What are you looking at ? - I 'm looking at you . You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it 's unnecessary . You don 't have to do this alone . You know , I wish I could believe that . I really do . But you 've gotta trust me . Contrary to popular belief , I know exactly what I 'm doing . ( SNORTS SOFTLY ) HAMMER : This is where we do it . This is my humble abode . You can work in absolute peace . Must be fun to be dead , right ? No pressure . Here they are . I 'm very excited . They 're combat-ready . I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production . ( CHUCKLING ) Sue me , I 'm enthusiastic . Go ahead , take a look around . ( STAMMERING ) Oh , you don 't wanna do that . You 'll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes . Can we generate some encrypted pass codes ? Get some of those encrypted pass codes , Jack . Never mind , I ... Wow . Okay . Good stuff . ( SPEAKS RUSSIAN ) - Sorry ? - Software shit . Uh-huh ? Well ... ( LAUGHS NERVOUSLY ) You 're good . You really blasted in past the firewall there . Uh ... Let me show you where you 're gonna be working primarily . Go ahead , take a look . Get a good look at that . That 's something , isn 't it ? You know , those are really just for show and tell . They 're $ 125.7 million a pop , so ... Wait ! Oh , gosh . Uh ... ( WHISPERS ) Jesus Christ . Get somebody up here . Um , that 's where the pilot goes . I 'm having a tough time finding volunteers . ( LAUGHS ) I 'll take care of that , just leave it . What you want them do ? Well , long term , I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years . I want to make Iron Man look like an antique . I wanna go to that Stark Expo , I wanna take a dump in Tony 's front yard . You know what I 'm talking about ? - ( CHUCKLES ) I can do that . No problem . - Yeah ? Hey , fabulous ! I love it . Hey , this is our guy . Didn 't I tell you ? I had a feeling . Do you know which watch you 'd like to wear tonight , Mr. Stark ? I 'll give them a look . I should cancel the party , huh ? - Probably . - Yeah . Cause it 's , um ... - Ill-timed . - Right , sends the wrong message . Inappropriate . Is that dirty enough for you ? Gold face , brown band . The Jaeger . I 'll give that a look . Bring them over here . I 'll take that . Why don 't you ... I gotta say it . It 's hard to get a read on you . - Where are you from ? - Legal . Can I ask you a question , hypothetically ? Bit odd . If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have , how would you celebrate it ? I 'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with . ( SIGHING ) ( SCRATCHING ) ( CALIFORNIA LOVE PLAYING ) VALET : Good evening . MAN : Good evening . Yes , sir , I understand . No . No , sir , that will not be necessary . I 'll handle it . Sir , I personally guarantee that within 24 hours , Iron Man will be back on watch . Hey , Pepper . - I 'm ... I 'm going to go get some air . - What 's wrong ? - I don 't know what to do . - You gotta be kidding me . - ( PEOPLE WHOOPING ) - ( CRASHING ) ( TONY LAUGHING DRUNKENLY ) - That 's it . I 'm making ... - No , no , no . Don 't call anyone . Pepper . This is ridiculous . I just stuck my neck out for this guy . I know . I know . I get it . I 'm gonna handle it , okay ? Just let me handle it . Handle it . Or I 'm gonna have to . You know , the question I get asked most often is , " Tony , how do you go to the bathroom in the suit ? " Just like that . ( ALL LAUGHING ) ( TONY GIGGLING DRUNKENLY ) Does this guy know how to throw a party or what ? ( PEOPLE CHEERING ) I love you . Unbelievable ! Thank you so much . Tony , we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night . And we 're gonna say good night now , - ( GUESTS GROANING ) - and thank you all for coming . No , no , no , we can 't ... Wait , wait , wait . We didn 't have the cake . We didn 't blow out the candles . You 're out of control , okay ? Trust me on this one , okay ? - You 're out of control , gorgeous . - It 's time to go to bed . It 's time . - Give me another smooch . - You 're not going to be - happy about this . - Come on , you know you want to . ( ENUNCIATING ) You just peed the suit . - I know . It has a filtration system . - It 's not sexy . You could drink that water . Just send everybody home , okay ? It 's time to ... - If you say so . - Okay . I 'll take this , you take that . Pepper Potts . ( SCATTERED APPLAUSE ) She 's right . The party 's over . Then again , the party was over for me , like , an hour and a half ago . The after-party starts in 15 minutes ! ( GUESTS CHEERING WILDLY ) And if anybody , Pepper , doesn 't like it , there 's the door . ( ENERGY BOLT FIRES ) Yeah ! Hit ! Pull ! ( TONY EXCLAIMING ) Pull ! ( TONY CHEERING ) STARK : I think she wants the Gallagher ! RHODES : I 'm only gonna say this once . Get out . You don 't deserve to wear one of these . Shut it down ! Goldstein . Yes , Mr. Stark ? ( GIGGLING ) Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy 's ass to . ( ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST PLAYING ) RHODES : I told you to shut it down . STARK : Now , put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt . Really ? Sorry , pal , but Iron Man doesn 't have a sidekick . Sidekick this ! Had enough ? - PEPPER : Natalie ! - Miss Potts . Don 't you " Miss Potts " me ! I 'm on to you . You know what ? Ever since you came here ... ( SHRIEKS ) HAPPY : Pepper ! Get out of here . Get out of here . STARK : You want it ? Take it ! ( MUSIC STOPS ) ( ROARS ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) RHODES : Put your hand down . You think you got what it takes to wear that suit ? RHODES : We don 't have to do this , Tony . You wanna be the War Machine , take your shot . - Put it down ! - You gonna take a shot ? - Put it down ! - No ! - Drop it , Tony ! - Take it ! ( ELECTRICITY CRACKLING ) ( BEEPING ) ( SYSTEMS POWERING UP ) ( ON RADIO ) Edwards Tower , this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes , inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet ... ( MEN CHATTERING ) ( RUMBLING APPROACHING ) ( WINDOWS RATTLING ) - Colonel . - Major . Wow . Yeah . Let 's take it inside . MAJOR : Clear the area . Sir ! I 'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut . I told you I don 't wanna join your super-secret boy band . ( CHUCKLES ) No , no , no . See , I remember , you do everything yourself . - How 's that working out for you ? - It 's ... It 's ... It 's ... ( SIGHS ) I 'm sorry . I don 't wanna get off on the wrong foot . Do I look at the patch or the eye ? Honestly , I 'm a bit hung over . I 'm not sure if you 're real or if I 'm having ... I am very real . I 'm the realest person you 're ever gonna meet . - Just my luck . Where 's the staff here ? - That 's not looking so good . STARK : I 've been worse . NATALIE : We 've secured the perimeter , but I don 't think we should hold it for too much longer . STARK : Huh ! - You 're ... fired . - That 's not up to you . Tony , I want you to meet Agent Romanoff . - Hi . - I 'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. shadow . Once we knew you were ill , I was tasked to you by Director Fury . I suggest you apologize . You 've been very busy . You made your girl your CEO , you 're giving away all your stuff . You let your friend fly away with your suit . Now , if I didn 't know better ... You don 't know better . I didn 't give it to him . He took it . Whoa , whoa , whoa . He took it ? You 're Iron Man and he just took it ? The little brother walked in there , kicked your ass and took your suit ? Is that possible ? Well , according to Mr. Stark 's database security guidelines , there are redundancies to prevent unauthorized usage . ( SNORTS SOFTLY ) - What do you want from me ? - What do we want from you ? Uh-uh . ( STRESSING ) What do you want from me ? You have become a problem , a problem I have to deal with . Contrary to your belief , you are not the center of my universe . I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with . Hit him . ( GROANS ) Oh , God , are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it ? Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds ? - What did she just do to me ? - What did we just do for you ? That 's lithium dioxide . It 's gonna take the edge off . We 're trying to get you back to work . Give me a couple of boxes of that . I 'll be right as rain . It 's not a cure , it just abates the symptoms . Doesn 't look like it 's gonna be an easy fix . Trust me , I know . I 'm good at this stuff . I 've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium . I 've tried every combination , every permutation of every known element . Well , I 'm here to tell you , you haven 't tried them all . Hey , hey , hey . Special delivery . Candygram . HAMMER : I brought you something . Oh , yeah . - ( BIRD SQUAWKS ) - ( HAMMER CHUCKLING ) We got you the bird , pal ! This is not my bird . What do you mean ? That 's the bird . This is the bird . Yeah ! Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird . This is a great bird . - It 's a beautiful bird . - We got this all the way from Russia . - ( POUNDS TABLE ) - Hey , man , this not my bird . Well , listen , even if it 's not the bird , I mean , this is a gorgeous bird . I mean , you know , look , don 't get so attached to things . Learn to let go . ( BIRD SQUAWKS ) Wait a minute . Jack , what is that ? Is that ... That 's not a helmet . What is that ? Um ... Ivan ... What 's this ? Jack . Is that a helmet ? It doesn 't look like a helmet to me . How ... How are you supposed to get a head in there ? - Jack , could you put your head in there ? - No . Try to put your head in there . Go ahead . Try to put your head in there . See , Ivan ? He can 't put his head in there . That 's ... That 's not a helmet . It 's a head . I need to put a guy in there . I need to fit a person in that suit . You understand ? - Drone better . - What ? Drone better ? Why is drone better ? Why is drone better ? People make problem . Trust me . Drone better . Ivan , you know , I like you . I got you the bird . You said , " No problem . " That 's what you said to me . You said , " No problem . " Now I need suits . The government wants suits . Like Iron Man . You understand ? That 's what the people want . That 's what 's gonna make them happy . Hey , man . Don 't get too attached to things . Learn to let go . These drones better steal the show , Ivan . You understand ? Better rock my world , Ivan . Unbelievable . This ought to get the Senate off my ass . - It 's functional ? - Fully mission-capable . Good . Get Hammer down here to weaponize it . Sir ? Justin Hammer 's making a weapons presentation at the Expo . We 'd like this to introduce it . Sir , I don 't believe that the Expo ... Colonel , the world needs to see this fast . - We 've got to make this happen . - Yes , General , but ... It 's also an order . Yes , sir . Good work , Colonel . You 've made your country proud . Thank you , sir . That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology . No , it was finished . It has never been particularly effective - until I miniaturized it and put it in my ... - No . Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater . He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race . He was on to something big , something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery . Just him , or was Anton Vanko in on this , too ? Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin . Anton saw it as a way to get rich . When your father found out , he had him deported . When the Russians found out he couldn 't deliver , they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage . Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in , the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco . You told me I hadn 't tried everything . What do you mean I haven 't tried everything ? What haven 't I tried ? He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started . - He said that ? - Mmm . Are you that guy ? Hmm ? Are you ? 'Cause if you are , then you can solve the riddle of your heart . I don 't know where you get your information , but he wasn 't my biggest fan . What do you remember about your dad ? He was cold , he was calculating . He never told me he loved me . He never even told me he liked me , so it 's a little tough for me to digest when you 're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he 's passing it down . I don 't get that . You 're talking about a guy whose happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school . That 's not true . Well , then , clearly you knew my dad better than I did . As a matter of fact , I did . He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D. What ? - I got a 2 : 00 . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . - What 's this ? - Okay , you 're good , right ? - No , I 'm not good . - You got this ? Right ? Right ? Got what ? I don 't even know what I 'm supposed to get . Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact . - You remember Agent Coulson , right ? - Yeah . Oh , and Tony , remember , I got my eye on you . We 've disabled all communications . No contact with the outside world . Good luck . Please . First thing , I need a little bodywork . I 'll put in a little time at the lab . If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean , Cross Creek , for a Starbucks run , or something like that , that 'd be nice . I 'm not here for that . I 've been authorized by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises . If you attempt to leave or play any games , I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet . - Okay ? - I think I got it , yeah . Enjoy your evening 's entertainment . - Think this is the power source ? - Major , this is not a scientific exercise . Let 's just focus on arming it , all right ? Yes , sir . HAMMER : Oh , yes ! Oh , yes , yes , yes . Is it my birthday ? You got it . What did you do ? What did you do ? ( SIGHING REVERENTLY ) Oh ! - Is this what I think it is ? - Yes , it is . Hammer , I want to know what you 're gonna do for us . What am I going to do for you ? Well , the first thing I 'm gonna do for you is I 'm gonna upgrade your software . - And then , second , I think I should ... - That 's not what I 'm talking about . I 'm talking about firepower . Well , you 're talking to the right guy . ( CRUNCHING ) Claridge Hi-Tec , semi-automatic , 9mm pistol . Too downtown ? I agree . M24 shotgun , pump action . Five-round magazine . You know what ? You 're not a hunter . What am I talking about ? I 'm getting rid of it . This is the FN-2000 from Belgium . They do make something better than waffles . It 's beautiful , but I can tell this isn 't disco enough for you , so I 'm gonna put it right here . You 're looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher . Tear gas , smoke . Hippie control . You 're tough . Let me tell you something . Size does matter . Don 't let anyone tell you different . This is an M134 7.62 Minigun . Six individual barrels . The torso taker , powder maker . Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho , or Puff the Magic Dragon . Okay . These are the Cubans , baby . This is the Cohibas , the Montecristos . This is a kinetic-kill , side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst . It 's capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted . If it were any smarter , it would write a book . A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon . It would read it to you . This is my Eiffel Tower . This is my Rachmaninoff 's Third . My Pietà . It 's completely elegant . It 's bafflingly beautiful . It 's capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero . I call it the Ex-Wife . That 's the best I got . Are we gonna do this ? Give me something here . - You 're like a sphinx . I can 't read you . - I think I 'll take it . - Which one ? - All of it . All of it . ( PROJECTOR WHIRRING ) Everything is achievable through technology . Better living , robust health and for the first time in human history , the possibility of world peace . I 'm Howard Stark , and everything you 'll need for the future can be found right here . City of the Future ? City of Tomorrow ? City of ... I 'm Howard Stark , and everything you 'll need in the future can be found right here . So , from all of us at Stark Industries , I would like to personally ... Tony , what are you doing back there ? What is that ? Put that back . ( FIRMLY ) Put it back where you got it from . Where 's your mother ? Maria ? Go on . Go , go , go , go . All right , I think we got ... I 'll ... I 'll ... I 'll come in and ... Are you waiting on me ? So , from all of us at Stark Industries , I 'd like to personally show you my ass . I 'd like to ... I can 't ... This is ... I can 't ... We have this , don 't we ? This is a ridiculous way ... Everything is achievable through technology . Tony ? You 're too young to understand this right now , so I thought I would put it on film for you . I built this for you . And someday you 'll realize that it represents a whole lot more than just people 's inventions . It represents my life 's work . This is the key to the future . I 'm limited by the technology of my time , but one day you 'll figure this out . And when you do , you will change the world . What is and always will be my greatest creation is you . ( POWERFUL ENGINE REVVING ) ( BOTH SPEAKING IN SPANISH ) - $ 6 . Six . - I don 't have any dough . - Here . - No , sir , that 's too much . No , it 's fine . Take that . - It 's fine . - No , señor . Take it . Take it . I don 't like people handing me things . If you just drop that there , that 'd be great . - Are you Iron Man ? - Sometimes . We believe in you ! It was an illegal seizure of trademark property . - Miss Potts ? - STARK : Relax . SECRETARY : Mr. Stark ... STARK : ls here . - He refuses ... - I don 't . It 's fine . - I 'll just be a second . - Listen , it 's our position that Stark has and continues to maintain proprietary ownership of the Mark ll platform . MAN ON TV : When Mr. Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man , - he was making a promise to America . - PEPPER : No , the suit belongs to us . We trusted that he would look out for us . - Yeah , but you 're not ... Burt ... - He obviously did not . - And now we learn that his secretary ... - Yes , it does . ... a woman named Virginia " Pepper " Potts , has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries . - What are her qualifications ? - ( FIRMLY ) No . Ms. Potts is doing nothing to manage this terrible ... STARK : Mute . PEPPER : No ... Burt ... Burt ... Burt , listen to me . Don 't tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country - and then not let me pursue this . - I 'll get this stuff out of here . Well , then , tell the President to sign an order . ( SIGHS ) We 'll talk about it at the Expo . Hammer 's giving some presentation tomorrow evening . - Will Tony Stark be there ? - Will I ? - No , he will not . Bye . - I would like to be . - Got a minute ? - No . Come on , you just got off the phone . You 're fine , 30 seconds . - Twenty-nine . Twenty-eight . - Okay , I , um ... I was just driving over here , and I thought I was coming to basically apologize , but I 'm not . - Oh , you didn 't come here to apologize ? - Look , that goes without saying , and I 'm working on that . But I haven 't been entirely upfront with you , and I just want to try to make good . Can I move this ? This is crazy . It 's like a Ferris wheel going . - I 'm trying to get some ... - No . ( TONY CLEARS THROAT ) Do you know how short life is ? And if I never got to express ... And by the way , this is somewhat revelatory to me . And I don 't care ... I mean , I care . It would be nice . I 'm not expecting you to ... Look , here 's what I 'm trying to say . I 'm just gonna say it . Let me stop you right here , okay ? Because if you say " I " one more time , I 'm gonna actually hurl something at your head , I think . I am trying to run a company . - Do you have any idea what that entails ? - Yes . People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you 've disappeared , and all I 'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it . I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do . Did you bring me strawberries ? Did you know that there 's only one thing on Earth that I 'm allergic to ? Allergic to strawberries . Mmm-hmm . This is progress , Pepper . I knew there was a correlation between you and this . - I need you ... - I need you , too . - That 's what I 'm trying to ... - ... to leave now . - Ms. Potts ? - Hi , come on in . - Wheels up in 25 minutes . - Thank you . - Anything else , boss ? - I 'm good , Hap . No , I 'll be just ... another minute . I lost both the kids in the divorce . ( TONY LAUGHS ) No . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Are you blending in well here , Natalie ? Here at Stark Enterprises ? Your name is Natalie , isn 't it ? I thought you two didn 't get along . - No . That 's not so . - It 's just me you don 't care for . - No ? Nothing ? - PEPPER : Actually , while you 're here , maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings . Absolutely . I 'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut . Boy , you 're good . You are mind-blowingly duplicitous . How do you do it ? You just tear things ... You 're a triple impostor . I 've never seen anything like you . ls there anything real about you ? Do you even speak Latin ? ( SPEAKING LATIN ) Which means ? Wait . What ? What did you just say ? It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected . You 're good ! ( SIGHS ) ( SIGHS ) ( BLOWS ) Jarvis , could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame ?

Get rid of them . - What is it you 're trying to achieve , sir ? I 'm discovering ... Correction . I 'm rediscovering a new element , I believe . Lose the landscaping , the shrubbery , the trees . Parking lots , exits , entrances . Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework . Dad . Dead for almost 20 years , and still taking me to school . The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium . Thanks , Dad . Unfortunately , it is impossible to synthesize . STARK : Uh-huh . Get ready for a major remodel , fellas !

Now , are you gonna let me work or break my balls ? What 's this doing here ? That 's it . - Bring that to me . - You know what this is ? It 's exactly what I need to make this work . Lift the coil . Go , go . Put your knees into it . There you go . And ... Drop it . Drop it . Perfectly level . - ( SNORTS ) I 'm busy . What do you want ? - Nothing . - Goodbye . I 've been reassigned . - Huh .

And now your overpriced paperweights are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration . Do you dig what I 'm getting at here ? ( SPEAKING RUSSIAN ) ( CHUCKLING ) I don 't know if you know this , ( SHOUTING ) but I don 't speak Russian ! I 'm gonna leave now . I 'm gonna go to the Expo . Maybe I 'll even get laid . You see these guys ? They 're your babysitters . They are not to be trifled with . When I get back , we 're gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement . And you 're gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don 't , you 're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you , a dead man . You got that ? Maybe you can watch me on TV . ( DOOR OPENS ) ( DOOR CLOSES ) ( SCOFFS ) STARK : Dummy , you , can we clean up this mess ? - You 're killing me . You know I don 't ... - ( PHONE RINGING ) JARVIS : Incoming call with a blocked number , sir . My phone privilege is reinstated . Lovely . Coulson . How 's the Land of Enchantment ? IVAN : Hey , Tony , how you doing ? ( LAUGHS ) - I double cycle . - You what ? You told me double cycle 's more power . Good advice . You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy . You , too .

What your father did to my family over 40 years , I will do to you in 40 minutes . Sounds good . Let 's get together and hash it out . JARVIS : Tri-State area . Manhattan and outlying boroughs . I hope you 're ready . ( DIALING TONE DRONING ) JARVIS : Call trace incomplete . ( SIGHS ) - JARVIS : Sir ... - You want to run some tests , run them . And assemble the suit while you 're at it .

( AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ) ( PICK UP THE PIECES PLAYING OVER PA ) HAMMER : Yeah ! That 's what I 'm talking about . Thanks for coming . Ladies and gentlemen , for far too long , this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm 's way , but then the Iron Man arrived , and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us . Sadly , that technology was kept out of reach . That 's not fair . That 's not right . - And it 's just too bad . - ( SIGHING ) Oh , Lord . Regardless , it was an impressive innovation , one that grabbed headlines the world over . Well , today , my friends , the press is faced with quite a different problem .

My body , literally , cannot handle the stress . I never know if you 're gonna kill yourself or wreck the whole company . I think I did okay . I quit . I 'm resigning . That 's it . What did you just say ? You 're done ? That 's surprising . No , it 's not surprising . I get it . - You don 't have to make any excuses . - I 'm ... I 'm ... I 'm not making any excuses . You actually were just making excuses . - But you don 't have to . - No , I wasn 't making an excuse . - I 'm actually very justified . - Listen . Hey , hey . - You deserve better . - Well ... You 've taken such good care of me . I 've been in a tough spot , but you got me through it , so ... Right ? - Thank you . - Yeah . - Thank you for understanding . - Yeah , yeah . Let 's talk clean-up . - I 'll handle the transition . It 'll be smooth . - Okay . What about the press ? Because you only had the job for a week . That 's gonna seem ... - Well , with you it 's like dog years . - I know . I mean , it 's like the Presidency ... - Weird . - ( SOFTLY ) No , it 's not weird . - It 's okay , right ? - Yeah . Run that by me again . RHODES : I think it was weird . You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape . - I had just quit , actually . - Yeah , so we 're not ... You don 't have to do that . I heard the whole thing . - You should get lost . - I was here first . Get a roof . ( TONY CHUCKLES ) - I thought you were out of one-liners . - That 's the last one . - You kicked ass back there , by the way . - Thank you . You , too . Listen , my car got taken out in the explosion , so I 'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute , okay ? Not okay . Not okay with that . It wasn 't a question . How are you gonna resign if I don 't accept ? - ( PEPPER LAUGHS ) - Hmm ? I don 't think I want you looking at that . I 'm not sure it pertains to you anymore . Now this , on the other hand , is Agent Romanoff 's assessment of you . - Read it . - Uh ... " Personality overview . Mr. Stark displays compulsive behavior . " In my own defense , that was last week . " Prone to self-destructive tendencies . " I was dying . I mean , please . And aren 't we all ? " Textbook narcissism " ? Agreed . Okay , here it is . Uh ... " Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative . Iron Man ? Yes . " - I gotta think about it . - Read on . " Tony Stark not ... " Not recommended " ? That doesn 't make any sense . How can you approve me but not approve me ? I got a new ticker . ( STAMMERING ) I 'm trying to do right by Pepper . I 'm in a stable-ish relationship . Which leads us to believe at this juncture we 'd only like to use you as a consultant . You can 't afford me . Then again , I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favor . Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington and we need a presenter . I 'll see what I can do . ( HIGHWAY TO HELL PLAYING ) it is my honor to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr. Tony Stark , who is , of course , a national treasure . Thank you , Lieutenant Colonel , for such an exceptionally distinguished performance . - You deserve this . - Thank you , sir . Mr. Stark . Thank you for such an exceptionally distinguished performance . You deserve this . Ow ! Oh , sorry . Funny how annoying a little prick can be , isn 't it ? Let 's get a photo .

 QUINCY [ IN RUSSIAN ] : MAN : Quincy , stack them two and two ? RACHEL : We 'll need 20 amps for a new circuit at least three laptops , four external hard drives . - You can leave that right there . Thank you . MAN : Yes , ma 'am . - [ IN ENGLISH ] Well ? - They 're gonna get us what we need . If you mean to do this , we 're gonna need a much more comprehensive cooling system . - And I have told them as much . - Vials , syringes . - We 're running low on everything . - Quincy , I know . We will replenish once we get to Guantanamo Bay . I 'm gonna ask a question . - And I want you to listen to me . - Go ahead . You 're working 20 hours a day . You 're not sleeping . This is a marathon , not a sprint . Let me go off-ship this time . I 'll think about it . Hup , fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Ready , halt . Headshot ! Weapons on safe . Cossetti , keep that right arm blocked . Make sure you lean into that recoil . COSSETTI : Sir . - Next group ! How are they looking ? Janowitz has an eye . Harris and Cossetti have the balls . - Depends on what we 're gonna need there . - Balls . We need the balls . Yes , sir . TAC Team One advance ! TAC Two , let 's go ! Advance ! Damn it , Miller ! - Muzzle down ! - Sorry , sir ! Sorry 's not gonna do us any good when you shoot his head off at Gitmo ! Now TAC One , TAC Two , reset . Do it again ! - It 's gonna take time , sir . - Time is something we don 't have . Every day we don 't come home with a vaccine is a day another half a million people die . I want to make sure they 're ready . - You 'll get them there . - Yes , sir . TAC Team One advance ! Ripped By mstoll You will operate on three-man watch teams , 10-hour shifts . Captain wants a complete log of every transmission . You may be hearing emergency-broadcast and radio distress calls from around the world . But we do not , under any circumstances , respond or transmit . Strict EMCON . Our position must remain secure . - So the Russians are still following us ? - We don 't know that . Well , somebody shot a nuke over our heads outside France . - You been in CIC the last five days ? - Yes , ma 'am . ALISHA : Were there any surface or subsurface contacts ? - No , ma 'am . - Then let 's not start spreading rumors . They can be as contagious as the virus . This room will be restricted access . Comms specialists only . Got it ? Yes , ma 'am . Chief engineer ? Give me a status . Sir . The fuel from the cruise ship is absolutely filthy and just keeps degrading . If we don 't hit pay dirt at Gitmo , we might as well break out the oars . Don 't wanna burn through our nozzles . Take a couple engines off-line . No can do , sir . CO 's ordered flank speed all the way to Gitmo . - He 's up to date on the condition of the fuel ? - He is , sir . DANNY : Here you go , boy . - How 's training going ? - I don 't know exactly what we 're training for . Just gonna find a bunch of corpses . It must be tough having to train someone to replace Frankie . I 'm getting sick of this grub . I hope we find something other than mashed potatoes and cling peaches in Cuba . [ DANNY WHISTLES DOG WOOFS ] - Danny . - What ? You 're not dealing . Frankie 's dead . So are my parents , probably , and so are yours and everyone else 's in the whole damn world . So , what exactly is the proper way for me to be dealing ? MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : We 're low on food . Low on water . We need help . We 're in a warehouse off of Route 17 . I 'm with my two boys , so- - WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : If you can hear my voice we need medical assistance , please . We are right at the- - MILLER : I don 't really feel comfortable speaking in public but I just wanted to say something about my mother who 's in Iowa somewhere , I hope . God , please look over her and keep her safe . JETER : What 's her name , son ? Barbara . Barbara Miller . This is her . I 'd like to say a prayer for my boyfriend . His name 's Mickey . Well , his real name 's Morris . I ... . He hates having his picture taken so I 've just got this one . It 's a selfie . O 'CONNOR : This is my father , Paul . My brothers , Nate and Ronnie . Couldn 't get through to them , so I don 't know where they are . Like most of us , I guess . But , um , what keeps me going is the idea that we might be able to help them somehow . You know , maybe there is a reason we were out there in the Arctic all that time . Maybe this is God 's plan for us . Amen to that . ALL : Amen . RACHEL : The rules of the virus are these . It 's airborne . You can get it from anyone who 's a carrier anyone manifesting the disease , even a recently deceased corpse . Typical symptoms are lethargy and a cough followed by bleeding sores and hemorrhaging ending in dementia and total blood loss . - How long is the incubation period ? RACHEL : Three to five days . At least , that 's what I understood from my last contact with the CDC . And when was that ? Three weeks ago when we were in the Arctic . Are you saying the incubation period can change ? The virus has been mutating for some time although I believe now that it 's been altered , it 's stabilized . You believe ? What about animals ? If you 're concerned about Halsey , dogs happen to be immune . Animals can contract the disease . They can 't transmit it to humans . - I thought the birds were the original carriers . RACHEL : The birds were the carriers . The virus jumped , probably from their feces to a mammal before mutating and landing on us . After several mutations , it was artificially altered . It is that version of the mutated strain that is currently devastating our planet . So CBR gear at all times , except outside in open spaces . - Masks can be off to preserve your oxygen . - And inside ? RACHEL : One infected person could jeopardize this entire ship simply by breathing . Question . Before we send our men into a hot zone if the virus keeps mutating and you haven 't heard from homeland in almost a month how can you be sure of what you 're sure of ? If I had any doubt about what I was saying I would tell you . I would hope so . I see you 've cooled off . - I 'm fine . - Then what was that ? Just asking questions . You were undermining her in front of the officers . I know , Mike . She lied to us for four months . While she was talking to home every week we didn 't even get a chance to warn our families . - We 're just supposed to get over that ? - Yeah , we are . She 's got a long way to go before she earns my trust . - That 's all . - What about me ? There 's no Navy , no infrastructure , no food or fuel supply . We don 't know what we 're gonna find , and we 're gonna have to improvise every step . - Now , I 'm gonna need my XO- - - To fall in line ? To execute . Whether or not he agrees with my decisions . Now , I 'm gonna ask you one time and one time only : Are you with me ? I took an oath , and I still respect the chain of command . - That wasn 't my question . - I 'm with you . You really think she can do this ? She 's the only hope we got . PILOT : Coming over Gitmo now . Negative visual contact . Negative movement . DANNY : Where is everybody ? PILOT : Same on thermals . We have zero , copy , zero ground movement . There were 9000 people stationed there . Food warehouse and hospital look spread out . Fuel rig 's all the way up there . That 's why we 're gonna go with three teams . I 'll take the warehouse . You 'll hit the hospital . - Fuel team ready ? - We are , sir . Stay frosty . Something about this doesn 't feel right . Yes , sir . You 're absolutely the most obstinate person I 've met . - You know that ? - I don 't know everyone you 've met . - It 's insane . - If I let you go , you 'll be out there all week . - You 're too meticulous . - What if something happens ? He 's right . We can 't risk you leaving . - Thank you . I 'll get my suit . CHANDLER : Not so fast , doctor . - We can 't risk either of you . QUINCY : That 's flattering- - How do you plan on getting us the supplies ? Not to underestimate your men 's capabilities but it 's highly unlikely they 're gonna identify what we need . If we can knock an ICBM out of the sky , I think we can handle this . An officer will escort you both to CIC . And what about you , captain ? What if something happens to you ? The mission will go on in Commander Slattery 's very capable hands . After last night 's performance , I 'm not so sure . Well , we 're all out on a limb here , aren 't we ? Vulture Team is feet dry on the east beach . Proceed to first objective . Approaching the south gate . Cobra Team is approaching the hospital . Over here . We 've attached a helmet cam to Lieutenant Green . We can see everything he does and communicate to him by UHF . So you can get what you need . It 'll be fine . That 's my chair . I understand people aren 't particularly thrilled with me but I had orders . From the Pentagon . KARA : We understand orders . We follow them every day . Masks on . - Masks on . CRUZ : All right , masks up . We 've got 60 minutes of air at max conserve . Chief Lynn , XO . Fuel team 's approaching the rigs . - Expect to receive fuel within 15 minutes . LYNN [ OVER RADIO ] : Roger , XO . We need to find the valve wheel . It couldn 't have gone far . CHANDLER [ OVER RADIO ] : The Vulture Team heading due south sector . All 's quiet . [ METAL CLANGS ] Well , you bucking for a Silver Star , aren 't you , Miller ? You can 't teach courage like that . Follow our lead . We 'll be in and out in less than an hour . - Was it too much ? - Just enough . RIOS : Don 't touch that . You discharge that you 'll flood the whole engineering room with poisonous Halon gas . Uh , my state room is freezing , and I was told these levers might shut off the AC to my space . - By who ? - I don 't know . One of the enlisted men . Do us a favor . Don 't touch anything on the ship . - Of course . - If you need help , ask for it . - Very sorry . - Okay . [ GAGS ] Eyes in front of you . And do not puke in your mask . KARA : ls that what it was like on the cruise ship ? None of them wanna talk about it . That 's because there are no words . Nathan James , Tiger Team , we 're all set . SLATTERY [ OVER RADIO ] : Copy that . We are ready to receive . CCS Bridge , your martini is on its way . One , two , three . One more time . We got it . One , two , three . [ HUMMING ] Bridge , CCS , fueling commenced . - We 're in . - You 're looking for steroids . Interferon , Ribavirin . Any broad-spectrum antibiotics you can find . We need plastic ware , monitoring equipment , culture plates . Show me the whole room . Bring it round slowly . Over to the right . Back , back , back ! Back to the left . Move forward . Closer . - That 's it . That 's a centrifuge . DANNY [ OVER RADIO ] : Got it . CHANDLER : No apparent activity in Sector Charlie 5 . Vulture Team proceeding directly to objective . Copy that , Vulture One . Masks . TEX : I 'm an American ! Get the hell out of there ! Don 't ! Get out ! Stop it ! Get the hell out of there ! MAN 1 : Burk ! Get up , get up , get going ! Weapons . [ MAN 2 SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] I 'm American . I 'm friendly . - I 'm a friendly American . - This is Vulture . We 're under attack by unknown number of hostiles . Stand by for fire mission . Set General Quarters ! Threat warning red , weapons tight ! General Quarters , General Quarters . All hands , man your battle stations . Light off mount five one . Shift to local ready surface . Vulture One , Nathan James , do we have a target ? Negative . Cobra Team , Tiger Team , be advised . Hostiles operating on base . IEDs are being employed . Set fipcom delta . WOMAN : Copy that , Vulture One . - Master Chief , we need guns up . - I 'm on it . O 'Connor . This is Cobra Team . We 're a half mile south-southeast from your port ops . Say the word and we will provide backup . Negative . I don 't want you walking into an ambush . Stay on mission . Yes , sir . - Back up ! - Jesus , guys , I 'm on your side ! I said , back up ! I 'm not sick . Even the ass-bags who tried to kill you are not sick ! All right , set cover . But let him come . BURK : All right , step forward ! Slowly ! Hey , hey , hey , keep it slow . Moving slow . Everybody just take it easy . That 's far enough . Okay , commodore . You wanna get the lowdown or not ? Let 's start with the ass-bags . - They 're al Qaeda . What 's left of them . - How many ? Fourteen altogether , but they 're spread out now to make you a welcoming party . - Nobody 's sick ? - We were all in Section 7 an isolated part of the camp for high-level detainees . We had our own food stocks , own facilities . None of us came in contact with the virus . Everybody else was evacuated . We had the run of the place . We ? Me and six other guards . Subcontractors , private security . At that point , we figured no governments , no politics . - We let them go . - And they turned on you . TEX : That 's what 's left of my best friend . Other guy 's MIA . - I 'm the last man standing . - So where the hell are they ? TEX : Most went to guard the food warehouse but three peeled off towards your ship with rocket launchers . - You 're telling me this now ? - You 're the one asking the questions . Nathan James , Vulture One , be advised , hostiles are armed with RPGs en route to your whiskey . Tiger One , Nathan James , cease pumping . - Shut it down now . - Secure fueling . So , what can you tell me about this food warehouse ? How to get in , but it 's gonna mean getting your hands dirty . I 've dirtied them before . Tom Chandler , CO , Nathan James , U.S. Navy . Tex Nolan . Welcome to Gitmo . Man , only got 15 PSI . Shit . I 'm at 9 percent . All right , guys , listen to me . We got a job to do here and we 're not finished yet . No supplies , no vaccine . No vaccine , no going home , no seeing your families . - Lieutenant Green , don 't take any chances . DANNY : Follow my lead . We 'll be out of here in less than 10 , got it ? Let 's do this thing . Did he hear me ? He heard you . LYNN : Bridge , CCS . We 're still taking on fuel . Tiger Team , what the hell 's going on there ? GARNETT : The valve is frozen . We 're working on it , sir ! Come on . Ma 'am , stand back . XO , recommend disengaging the fuel hose on our end . Spill oil into the harbor while they have RPGs ? Hell , no . TAO , Bridge . We have hostiles incoming . Find me a target . Again . One , two ... Nathan James , the valve stem is shot , sir . We cannot stop the fuel . Incoming ! [ GARNETT ROANING ] CHUNG : Ma 'am !

Fire . Tiger Team , Nathan James . Doc Rios is en route . ETA five minutes . Vulture , Cobra , Nathan James . All known hostiles neutralized in the vicinity of the fuel pier . CHANDLER : Vulture Team , copy that . CHANDLER : So where are they gonna be ? Oatmeal and baked beans . It 's the new women and children . They 're holed up in that warehouse . They 're gonna make us come and get them . Captain . Animals . Revenge is best served cold . Let 's eat . Lieutenant Green , you have everything I need . Please get out of there now . Cobra One , copy . Proceeding to extract . [ BARKS ] [ GUNFIRE ] DANNY : Go , go ! Come on ! Go ! Sir , Cobra Team 's trapped inside the hospital , running out of air . We located the shooters outside the hospital ? Have a target ? BARKER : Negative , sir . - Patch me in to Green . - I 'm out of air ! - Two percent . - Almost nothing . - Couple of minutes , max ! I 'm gonna peel off Vulture to give you reinforcements . Negative . They 're too far away . They will never get here in time . But I got an idea . Copy that .

Your chief engineer was injured as well . - Lay him down . - Get him down . DANNY : Here you go . - You , hold that . DANNY : Set up a perimeter . - All right . SMITH : Yes , sir . COSSETTI : Get over watch . DANNY : Come on . SMITH : Got the high point . DANNY : He 's gonna bleed out . Wait ! - Get the doc ! RACHEL : We don 't have time to wait .

He 's a big fan of IEDs and mutilating American soldiers . Amir , my name is Tom Chandler , U.S. Navy . You don 't want to do this . Tex is the man who let you go from your cells . - He is no different from the others . - Hey , feeling 's mutual , you dirty- - Vulture Team , Nathan James . I need a status update . Vulture Team , Nathan James . Status ? CHANDLER : Nathan James , Vulture One . We 're at the food warehouse . Just trying to deal with a little hostage situation over here . AMIR [ OVER RADIO ] : Who are you talking to ? CHANDLER : I 'm answering my ship 's call . Otherwise , they 'll panic , start shelling the whole place . - He wants a diversion . CHANDLER : All we ' re doing is talking . - Let 's not get anybody else killed here . AMIR : No more talking to them . Talk to me ! Prepare the five-inch . Focus fire on Building 35 . Stand by for exact coordinates . Nishioka , eyes on . - Leave all food on this side of the building . - Not enough of you to eat that in 10 lifetimes . CHANDLER : Look . Amir , it 's a new world now . There 's no good guys and bad guys . Doesn 't matter which side we were on . We 're all just trying to survive . We don 't want to hurt you any more than you want to hurt us . But you know I 'm not leaving here without my man . - So when you let Tex go- - - If I let him go ! When you let him go , we 'll be on our way . I 'll decide how much food we leave you with . AMIR : No ! Enough of this ! Listen to me , Amir . You want the entire southwest corner of the warehouse . Focus fire Building 35 , southwest corner . That 's almost half the food in the entire place . Is that gonna make you happy ? No . You will leave all the food on this side of the building , or he dies . Well , now , see , we got a bit of a problem with that . Because there 's one thing from the old world that still applies today something that will never change . - Target acquired . - Fire ! We don 't negotiate with terrorists . Clear ! Nice . Yes . Good work , good work . I don 't know how you feel about the water but we sure could use your services . Where you headed ? We got some things to do , but when we 're done , we 're going home . Yeah , I 'll sign up for that . CHANDLER : Nathan James , Vulture One . Hostage situation resolved . Thank you for the close shave . We are inbound . ALISHA [ OVER PA ] : Now go to your stations , all special sea and anchor detail . Nathan James will get under way at 1700 . All departments make manned and ready special reports to the XO on the bridge . Captain 's on the bridge . Hey . We 're loading up RHIBs and SDV subs . Trucks are bringing over the food . - Suppo thinks it 's gonna last five , six weeks . - And fuel ? We lost suction on the tank at 96 percent . And the chief engineer took some shrapnel . She 's gonna be okay , though . - Tough as nails , that one . - When push comes to shove , they all are . Gentlemen , apparently one of the machines in the lab got tipped over . Dr. Tophet is insists he needs time to secure and recalibrate before we move the ship . - How long ? - He says three to four hours . Where 's Dr. Scott ? Still in medical . Was a tough call . We did good today . Captain , I 'm picking up a contact headed for the harbor . Negative electronic signature . They 're not operating their radar . Cannot make a positive ID . Vessel 21 miles southeast , Guantanamo Bay this is U.S. Navy warship one-five-one hailing you on channel one-six . Identify yourself , over . WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : This is British Naval vessel HMS Suffolk ... SLATTERY : Confirm that . ... hull number five-two-five , IMO call sign whiskey-echo-bravo-two-three-six . None of us have been infected , but we 're running low on food . We 've been searching for a place to replenish ... - ... and repair our radar . - Confirmed , sir . This is Commander Tom Chandler , Commanding Officer , USS Nathan James . We welcome you to Guantanamo Bay . Wish you would 've been here a few hours ago . We could 've used the help . I assure you that next time , we will be there for you should you choose to accept an association . Well , we 'll put some pot pies in the oven and some fish and chips in the fryer . Come on in . We can 't go anywhere till the lab 's fixed . Let 's prepare to greet our new friends . XO has the lead . Ow . Oh , that stings . RACHEL : It 's supposed to sting . I 'm cleaning it . - I don 't need it cleaned . - Yes , you do . RIOS : This is gonna sting a little . CHANDLER : How you doing , eng ? - All right , sir . - Doc says I 'll be on my feet soon enough . - No rush . We got it all under control . She saved him . She 's gonna save us all . Right , Dr. Scott ? Well , hopefully , we 'll save each other . Real soulful , this one . Never mind them good looks , that brassy exterior . Word ? I know . Don 't do it again . You don 't have anything to prove if that 's what it was about . And don 't do it again . TEX : Hey ! Nursey ! I need a cold compress here . Spoils of war . You know , I should be getting this stuff ready for his family . But , uh there 's nobody even to give it to . MAN 1 : Captain 's on the bridge . - They in sight ? - Yeah . I hear they serve Guinness on board . Sir , E-DUB can 't confirm the signature on that vessel , but they don 't think it 's British . CHANDLER : It 's the Russians . Set General Quarters now !

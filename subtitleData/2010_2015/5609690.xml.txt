 Coulson : Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program . - Mike Peterson 's alive . - They did something to him . [ screams ] GH-325 ... Agent Coulson was injected with that , and literally minutes later , his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration . Fury went to dangerous lengths to keep this under wraps . We can 't share this with anyone , for their safety and ours . Woman : Encrypted line secure . Agent Melinda May . Update log 93 . Coulson knows . 1x16 - " End of the Beginning " [ beep ] Woman : Agent John Garrett , confirmed . [ beep ] Agent Antoine Triplett , confirmed . Well , it 's no four seasons . Well , as safe houses go , it 's not bad . - Phuket didn 't even have mattresses . - Yeah , but Cairo had thousand-thread-count sheets , with that sateen finish . Hey , be careful what you get used to . [ cork pops ] Dig out that sat phone and get Coulson on the line . I want to run down through the list of potential candidates with him . You really think the Clairvoyant was on the index ? Rejected off the index . Possibly . Just hope it 's not the amazing Kreskin . [ chuckles ] I used to love that guy . - Who ? - Area 3 , breach . [ alarm buzzing ] - Aah ! - Hit him with an icer ! [ groans ] What the hell ? He 's not going down ! [ glass shatters ] You realize , Agent Coulson , they have these things - called teleconferences now . - Nice to see you , too , Agent Hand . Thank you all for coming on such short notice . A little unconventional meeting this way , isn 't it ? Oh , from the reports I 've read , " unconventional " seems to be Coulson 's middle name these days . Fight breaks out , let me take Blake . He 's coy but scrappy . I 'll explain everything as soon as we hit 50,000 feet . This way . Cruising altitude reached , bearing 90 degrees just over the North pole . - Thank you . - Apologies for the song and dance , but we brought you here as a precaution . - A precaution against what ? - The Clairvoyant . If there is someone out there who can read minds , at least up here , we 're as far away from him as possible . Garrett : Figure maybe the Northern lights will knock a few bars off his psychic wi-fi . Coulson , you know S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s stance on psychics ... they don 't exist . - Are you suddenly a believer ? - Not definitively . But I had a recent experience with an Asgardian who could bend people 's will with her voice . Forced me to open my mind , so to speak . Garrett : All we know for sure is the Clairvoyant 's been a step ahead of us , stealing plays from our playbook . And it 's pissing me off . I take it you 've all read Agent Garrett 's latest report . The hit on the safe house . Mr. Peterson 's alive and kicking . - We call him Deathlok . - It was the project 's code name . Agent Garrett and I have been tracking him the last few weeks . And we think the Clairvoyant 's super-soldier bodyguard came after us for a reason . - We 're getting close . - To what ? His identity ? We 've narrowed the list to 13 candidates . Narrowed it how ? From what ? Agent Garrett has been taking a second look at S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s gifted index , specifically the rejects . Garrett : Individuals S.H.I.E.L.D. interviewed who are believed to have psychic abilities but were ultimately dismissed . So you think we 've encountered the Clairvoyant before . Think how many cases we 've encountered across the globe , how many cases we vetted . - It 's more than possible . It 's probable . - I need more coffee . Let 's assume what you 're saying is possible . What then ? If we 're going up against an actual Clairvoyant , how do you suggest we combat that ? By compartmentalizing the information . A member of my team is an expert at pattern recognition and analysis ... finding needles in haystacks . She 'll prioritize the candidates on Garrett 's list , locate them , then pair us off into random teams . That way , only one person knows the full scope of the mission . You do understand that this person you 're referring to ... she 'd need to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent to be granted that level of access . I 'm glad you brought that up . Guys , I swear , I am fine . How much blood are you gonna draw before you believe me ? Your recovery ... it 's honestly quite unbelievable . - Strange . - We know Coulson had a very different recovery experience , so we understand why he 's hesitant - about sharing our findings with others . - Yeah , but something like this drug ... it needs to be studied . Has the potential to save so many lives . We 'd like to send a blood sample of yours to some colleagues to do a molecular breakdown . Maybe if you spoke to Agent Coulson ... Yeah , I don 't think that 's a good idea . If Coulson thinks it 's important that this stays between us , then we should trust him . Right ? He 's the boss . So you 're saying we should obey the rules . Who are you , and what have you done with Skye ? Skye , upstairs . Top brass wants to see you . Pairing off makes total sense . Just one thought , though ... - what if we make it a double-blind ? - How so ? Well , I 'll give one person from each team the potential Clairvoyant 's coordinates , and I 'll give the other one the identity . That way , no one person knows the full specs of the op until you get there . I like how you think . I like how she thinks . One question ... how am I supposed to access all the classified files without someone in the room ? - I don 't have clearance . - Now you do . Welcome to S.H.I.E.L.D. , Skye . I told them to come up . I ... I ... I don 't know what to say . - Thank you . - Don 't thank me . You 've passed every required S.H.I.E.L.D. - exam with flying colors . - For a level 1 agent . You 've assisted us on multiple field missions , put your life on the line . You earned this . Hell ... you took two in the gut . More than Sitwell here 's ever done . Okay , everyone . Back to work . - Congratulations . - Thanks . - Congratulations , Skye . Awesome ! - Congratulations . Couldn 't have done it without a great and very patient S.O. Yeah , you could have . I 'm no Clairvoyant , but I do believe some things are meant to be . [ knock on door ] Don 't say I never gave you anything . [ whirring ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ beeping ] They 're coming for me . It 's time we finally meet . Can 't say I 'm a fan ... of this double-blind situation . How will the field teams meet us at the destinations ? They won 't . They 'll be on standby . We can 't risk the Clairvoyant knowing we 're coming . What you 're saying is , one of these teams could be heading straight into an ambush without backup . Agent Sitwell , I just received word from the Triskelion . You have orders to report to the Lemurian Star immediately . So I assume you 'll take his place . In your hunt for Santa Claus ? No . I 'm taking a transport jet back to the Hub where I can quarterback the field teams via satellite . Someone 's gonna have to pull your asses out of the fire when things go South . I 'll be in touch . I guess I got a boat to catch . - Good luck , Agent Coulson . - You , too , Agent Sitwell . Skye : Okay , on this phone , you will find a set of coordinates that 'll lead you to one of the three potential Clairvoyants I 've chosen . When you 're within a mile , your partner will be granted access to the candidate 's name and profile on their own phone . - Make sense ? - You know , we haven 't officially met . - John Garrett . - I guess lying unconscious in a gurney ... really should not count . [ chuckles ] How are you feeling ? A lot better , actually . I 've been shot a couple times myself ... back , shoulder . Had my throat cut once . But you know the toughest one ? Thing about a third-degree burn ... the burn itself doesn 't hurt at all . Crazy , right ? The nerve endings get all fried . But the area around the burn ? That smarts . Still , gut shot 's the worst . Sir , I know what you did for me , how you risked your life to save me . - So thank you . - You 've got a good team around you . I just jumped on the bandwagon . Well , you trained one of them , sir . Guess it all comes full circle . Ward 's your S.O. , I was his . Turn , turn , turn . But this S.O. thing goes both ways . You 've had a big impact on him . He 's different than I remember him . - Different how ? - Well , the tough thing about being a specialist is being alone . A team gives you a whole new perspective . Guess it 's the difference between fighting against something and fighting for something . Or someone . Ward 's got that now . Thanks for this . And , Skye , lose the " sir . " I 'm a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , just like you . What 's this ? Um , say you need to tag a fleeing vehicle ... or a wild monkey , if it was to get away from you . These rounds are built with a micro-receiver , which enables you to track your target via satellite . I 've condensed all the blood-sample results into an encrypted file . Now if we just had access to ... Jemma , we have a visitor . Oh . May . Hello . I assume you 're talking about Skye 's blood . There 's just so much we don 't know . - The GH-325 . - 325 . I mean , we don 't know what drug it is , where it came from . Yeah , not to mention any potential side effects , - short - or long-term . - We 're just worried about Skye . - And Agent Coulson , of course . - Have either of them exhibited any side effects or strange behavior ? - " Strange " is such a subjective term . - No more than usual . Because if they have , or if they do in the future , feel free to contact me first . I can help . Okay ? Okay . You 're all set . Hope you paired me with someone good ... or interesting , at least . Stop worrying . You wear your heart on your sleeve . And your face . I trust your judgment . The way you see the world ... it 's different than the rest of us . That 's why I want you to dig deeper into these . The candidates ' psych evaluations ? The Clairvoyant thinks he can read our minds . See if you can read his . We need some insight into who this person really is , a weakness . So , do what you do ... find the exploit . And stop worrying . So , Garrett says your family 's like the cable version of the Kennedys . Huh . I doubt he said that . [ chuckles ] Fine . I did my own research . Had to , following in golden boy 's footsteps . - There a point to this ? - Just trying to keep things light . 'Cause that 's what we all need right now . - You know , maybe it is . - You want to keep it light ? The Clairvoyant almost killed Skye . Yeah ? Well , he did kill my partner ... Dan Monroe . Great guy . Had a son . You know what it 's like telling a 6-year-old that his dad isn 't coming home ? So , we find the Clairvoyant , you might want to stay out of my way . We all got axes to grind . But we 're here to take him in , not out . Ask yourself something , Agent Ward ... if Skye hadn 't made it , what would you be thinking right now ? [ sat phone beeping ] [ beep ] Elijah Fordham , 32 , military background . Here . Serving 18 life sentences for a killing spree in the ' 90s . Sounds more psycho than psychic . Blake : You a scorpio ? I was just wondering why our newest agent paired the two of us together . Must have thought we were compatible in some way . - It was random , Blake . - You seem like a scorpio . You don 't believe in the Clairvoyant , but you believe in astrology . I have some theories of my own . Please tell me we 're here for one of the doctors . Garrett : So , I dropped down through the skylight , used up my whole mag , and hit the final guy right in the chest with a flare gun . Boy , you should have seen the look on his face when that thing went off . What ? I already told you that one ? - I was there . - For which part ? - The whole thing . - Really ? Damn , I must be getting old . Either that or I drank a lot more in my 30s than I remember . Or both . And you didn 't go through the skylight . I know , but it makes for a better story . [ sat phone beeping ] File came in . Noriko Sato , 19 , junior at ball state . The co-ed ... I remember . She 's got an I.Q. over 200 . Ran circles around every agent we sent in to interrogate her . We had no indication she was gifted . - Family 's got ties to the Yakuza , though . - Heads up . - Detour . - Imagine that . Thomas Nash . Injured in a head-on collision . He 's been catatonic for the past four years . Great . We 're here for a vegetable . I 'll find the director 's office . - You get a room number on Nash . - Yes , ma 'am . [ buzzer ] [ breathes deeply ] [ buzzer ] Nobody home . Odd . Oh . Convenient timing . Think this 'll make a good story someday ? [ tires screech ] Ah . One behind us . You better hope so . [ binder closes ] [ bell dings ] [ grunts ] [ groans ] [ chokes ] Mr. Peterson ... stop . You have a son ... Ace . He needs you . We can still help you , Mike . Mike Peterson 's dead . [ chokes ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ] [ bones crack ] May to Hub ... Deathlok 's here ! Blake 's down ! All backup teams ... move in . We have an agent down . Repeat , Agent Blake is down . [ tires screech ] [ buzzer ] Lucky the med team got to him when they did . I wouldn 't call anyone in critical condition lucky . Deathlok 's more dangerous than we thought . Blake fired six shots ... didn 't seem to faze him . - Any word on Thomas Nash ? - No , he 's a ghost . The facility has him listed as a resident , - but it 's all a cover-up . - Nash is probably off fishing in Bora Bora right now , laughing at us . Coulson : And yet Mr. Peterson was waiting for you and Blake at the facility . Why ? Probably the same reason he came after Garrett ... we 're getting too close . He 's trying to take us out . This shouldn 't have happened . Backup should have been there alongside Agents Blake and May . - Clairvoyant would have seen us coming . - It appears he did anyway . The plan was flawed from the start . Come on , Vic . The plan was solid . We have an agent down because we weren 't prepared . Blake knew the risks . And don 't call me " Vic . " - It 's condescending . - Any one of us could have been ambushed . The point is , Blake 's alive , and we have a suspect ... Thomas Nash . I 'm headed inside to prep the field teams . Agent Coulson , when can I expect Agent Simmons for debrief ? She 's getting ready as we speak . Good . If I 'm gonna put any more agents in danger , I want them to know exactly what Deathlok is and what he 's capable of . Honestly , I don 't know how much more you can tell them . Who knows what else they 've done to the man ? Or how much man is left at all . Regardless , S.H.I.E.L.D. sees us as the resident experts on the Deathlok program . If they want me to stay here at the Hub , then that 's that . Well , don 't you seem awfully chipper to pick up and leave me by my lonesome . - Do I ? - Yes . No wonder . Could it be because the Hub 's lab facilities are much more comprehensive than ours ? In case I 'd like to run a molecular breakdown of Skye 's blood ? Yes . Brilliant deduction , Dr. Watson . I 've always pictured you as Watson . Either way , if you 're gonna do this , you 're gonna need my help . At some point , one way or another , eventually . Well , I wouldn 't go that far . I 'll jerry up an encrypted hard line so we can stay in touch . Don 't want the rest of the bus overhearing what we 're saying . - You ready to go ? - Agent Triplett . Are you staying at the Hub , as well ? Yes , Garrett 's keeping me here . Help brief the teams on our most recent run-in with the cyber soldier . - Don 't mind the company , do you ? - No , not at all . According to index archives , Nash has been on S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s radar for about six years . originally a bond trader in Canada doing very well for himself . Then the Canadian government recruited him to a secret department H-type program . They were looking for people with psychic abilities . Specifically people who could control human behavior , and Nash claimed he had a gift . - Claimed ? - According to records , he couldn 't affect a person 's behavior . But he could , on occasion , predict it . But S.H.I.E.L.D. crossed him off the index after his accident because of his supposed catatonic state . Which he recovered from quite nicely . It was all a lie ... just to throw S.H.I.E.L.D. off his scent . You said Blake fired how many rounds ? I heard six . Why ? Because there are only five missing from this magazine . And one from here . - These are Fitz 's tag rounds . - We can track him . Skye , check all the sat feeds . Find that signal . - On it . - I 'll get us in the air . Nicely done , Blake . [ tires screech ] I want this perimeter sealed . Two-man teams on every exit . Fitz , you got a signal ? 94 % , sir . Deathlok must be inside somewhere . - Possible civilians inside ? - Fitz : Highly doubtful . This racetrack 's been shut down for months . Move out ! Skye , run a back end from the tactical van . You , I want you 6 feet from Skye at all times , weapons hot . - Ward , it 's okay . I 'm ready . - Coulson : Ward 's right . I feel bad enough you 're already back in the field . I 'm not taking any chances with your safety . This isn 't a surprise party , people , so you can toss stealth out the window . Our target 's wearing body armor and has enhanced cybernetics . Make your shots count . Let 's move . - You ringing the bell or knocking ? - Knocking , of course . Clear ! Fitz , you 're up . It 's time to hunt , boys . Let 's find us a Deathlok . [ whirring ] Impressive toy . I prefer the term " high-tech hardware . " [ beeping ] - Skye , you online ? - Hang on . Northwest corridor is getting something . I 'm pulling up a live feed . I can 't confirm it 's him . Initiating multi-spectrum overlay . [ beeps ] - What the hell did they do to him ? - What are you seeing ? It 's not just his leg or his eye . They did stuff to him . It 's all under his skin . [ beeping ] Uh , signal 's dead . Retriever 's down . - He knows we 're here . - Fitz , get back to the van now . Contact ! Take cover ! - Ward , are you okay ? - Uh , I got two men down . - We need a med team ! - Requesting one now . May , he 's coming your way . Got him ! He just ducked into the Southwest stairwell . In pursuit . All teams ... he 's headed into the sub-basement . I do not have a visual . - Fitz , you have a retriever down here ? - On their way . [ gasps ] Easy . - I come in peace . - How about a signal next time ? [ machine-gun fire ] [ metallic clanging ] Fitz , you getting this ? Fitz : Uh , barely , sir . It leads down into the sewer system . That 's under at least ... 40 feet of concrete ? We 'll be blind down there . Where 's that little guy going ? [ beeping ] - Sir , there 's someone else down there . - Copy that . [ monitor beeping ] What the hell ? Nash : Agent Coulson , Agent Garrett , I surrender . [ monitor beeping ] Forgive me if we don 't shake hands . I don 't like to be touched . Ward : Sir , we 've got a lot of wires back here . Don 't touch anything . We need this room swept for explosives . There are no traps here , Agent Coulson . You 're here because we are destined to meet . You 're the Clairvoyant ? I 'm Thomas Nash . Mr. Po gave me that other name . A bit dramatic for my taste . Eyes open , everybody . We don 't know where Deathlok is or who else is down here . Mr. Peterson is gone . I cut his feed , so you won 't find him . But you had him lead us here . Why ? So I could see you with my own eyes instead of his . Now I understand why I couldn 't see you after you died ... because you , yourself , could not see . You were simply a broken man who did not know he was broken . You 're one to talk . Let 's pack this freak off to the fridge where he belongs . Agent Garrett , look at me . Do you believe you can confine me any more than this chair ? Can somebody please tell me how we turn that stupid voice thing off ? I will join Raina in your prison , Agent Coulson , but I will see you wherever you go , just as I saw you holding Skye in your arms , bleeding ... dying ... knowing it was all your fault . You 're going away . We 're gonna stick you in a little box where no one will ever hear you again . I see you 're angry . Head clouded with lies . You 've been betrayed , and now you fear what 's about to happen . Nothing 's about to happen . Just more empty threats from you . No . It is the inevitable . A force beyond your comprehension is coming for you ... you and Skye . She has something we want . And she will die giving it to us . I have seen it . Go to hell . No matter where I go or what you do to me , I will always ... [ gunshot ] [ monitor beeping ] [ flatline ] What did you do ? - Wait . What just happened ? - Did Ward just ... Oh , my lord . I can 't believe it . Bet the Clairvoyant didn 't see that coming . Garrett : He 's dead . It 's over . He 's a specialist . Cold blood 's a basic requirement . I know . Still , I didn 't think Ward would just do something like that . Whole reason I sent him to you was to knock off the rough edges . Maybe you did your job too well . He let his emotions get the best of him . You want me to escort him to the Hub for debrief ? No , I want to talk to him before he goes in front of the review board . Understood . I got my orders , then . Got to stay on the hunt for Deathlok . - Copy that . Keep me in the loop ? - Will do . Take care . And , Phil , go easy on the kid . [ May sighs ] Just got a message from H.Q. Director Fury 's back . - He 's waiting for you at the Triskelion . - About damn time . You can talk to him about what 's been bothering you . A lot 's bothering me . Thought you were Coulson . Thanks . [ groans ] - Why 'd you do it ? - I lost it . I got angry . He pushed all the right buttons . Coulson said the mission was to capture , not to kill . Think about what the Clairvoyant said , what he 's done . Think about the Centipede program , how he experimented on innocent people like Mike Peterson , how he kidnapped and tortured Coulson , how he ordered Quinn to shoot you . And he wasn 't gonna stop , Skye . Not until you ... I wasn 't gonna let that happen . - So , what happens now ? - I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board . Whatever the punishment , I 'll take it . I deserve it . But I don 't regret what I 've done . - You don 't ? - No . Not if it means you 're safe . You and the rest of the team . [ dial tone ] Yes . [ dialing ] [ ringing ] Simons : Fitz ? - Don 't use my name , Jemma . - Why not ? I thought you said ... going to use ... crypted line . - You 're cutting in and out . Hold on . - We ... there ? - What happened ... Ward ? - Well , yeah . You said ... Ward . Took us all by surprise . Hang ... Keep talking , okay ? I 'm gonna see if I can clear it up . So ... no idea ... be ... been a great deal of commotion on this end . Hang on , now . I think I 've found the problem . Looks like someone else is tapping the hard line . Wait , fit .. I think some ... happening . There 's agents rushing to the situation room . What ? [ dial tone ] Jemma ? Jemma , can you hear me ? Oh ... bloody hell . [ knock on door ] Mind if I talk some stuff through with you ? - Are you busy ? - I 'm worried . About Ward ? I know . I can 't believe he just killed someone like that . I 'm worried he killed the wrong man . How do we know it was him ? He never spoke . The computer spoke for him . How do we know he was the one controlling it ? Are you saying Nash could have been pretending to be the Clairvoyant ? I 'm saying Nash could have been a prop . - And now he 's dead . - After the attacks led us right to him . The investigation all wrapped up in a neat little bow . I feel like he could still be out there right now , in our heads . Or in our files . When you told me to check into the psych evals , you said something . You said , " read his mind . " And it got me thinking . And Ward said that the Clairvoyant knew how to push all the right buttons . Raina did that to me , too . Did she mention your father 's death ? Your psych evaluation called it " a defining moment . " These aren 't just personality tests . They 're surveillance on every agent ... pictures , stats , where you 've been stationed , who you 'd visit , where you 'd like to eat . Dinners at the Richmond . He 's been monitoring us . Think about it . The Clairvoyant only knew you 'd be at Quinn 's villa ... After I dropped a tracker . And the only thing he 's had trouble seeing is what happened to you after you died . Because Director Fury wouldn 't release that file to anyone . - No ... - The Clairvoyant doesn 't have abilities . He has security clearance . He 's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. [ door opens ] - Sir , first off , I want to say ... - Coulson : Save it . I don 't want your apologies . I don 't want your excuses . - I 'm not making excuses . - The only thing I want to know is whether you made the call yourself , - or did someone order you to do it ? - What ? Don 't play dumb , Agent Ward . Just answer the question ... Did someone order you to kill the Clairvoyant ? [ knock on door ] Fitz : May ? Another encrypted line . What are you up to , Agent May ? - What are you doing here ? - Um ... I was just wondering , since , uh ... 'cause we 're going to the Triskelion ... um , I thought you would like to , um ... there 's , uh , gonna be an aviation team on the ground . They could probably recalibrate it . But I think it 's ... it should be all right . [ breathing heavily ] - Fitz . - What ? - I was just looking for you . - Why ? I didn 't do anything . - What ? - What ? I didn 't say you did . What 'd you do ? Well , uh ... I 'm not quite sure , actually . 'Cause , um ... I was just , um ... um , doing maintenance in the avionics bay before . Okay . Why would May ... why would May have an unauthorized encrypted hard line in the cockpit , complete with a thumb scanner ? That isn 't in any of the plane 's specs . Slow down . An encrypted hard line ? Yeah . Dedicated to one receiver . She 's not supposed to have that . Who 's she talking to ? - Cut the line . - What ? You need to cut the line right now , Fitz . Do not let her call out ! [ beeping ] Agent Melinda May , update log 95 . [ static ] I wasn 't put on your plane so you could make me a better person , Coulson ! You put me here to make the hard call , and I made it . That 's not what I asked you , Agent Ward . I answered your question . I wasn 't working with anybody . I take full responsibility for my own actions . - Then why ... what ? - We have a problem . [ door closes ] [ gunshots ] Coulson : Put it down . Put it down , May ! It 's not what you think , Coulson . It 's just an icer . This one is not . It 's real , with real bullets . So you better put yours down and tell me what the hell 's going on right now . - I ... - Now ! - I can 't . - You better listen to the man , Agent May . You have no idea what you 're doing . Maybe not . But I know you 're not fast enough to take us both . Look ... I can explain everything . - But not here . - Why not here ? You have to check with someone first , using that encrypted phone in the cockpit ? Who 's on the other end of that line , May ? - I can 't say . - That 's okay . I think I know . It makes sense now why Deathlok put Blake in critical condition , left you alive and well , why he led us to the track only to disappear ... instead of defending his boss . Why would he do that ? Because that wasn 't his boss , was it ? - Was it ? ! - What are you talking about ? Stop lying to me ! Who do you answer to ? ! - Who 's the real Clairvoyant ? ! - Wha ... ? [ groans ] [ rumbling ] What did you do ? Where are we going ? I don 't know ! I didn 't do it , Phil ! I don 't know what 's happening here , I swear ! If you 're not doing this , who is ? When that plane touches down , take out everyone on board . Except Agent Coulson . He 's mine .

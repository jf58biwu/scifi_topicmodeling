 Previously on Heroes ... My name is Samuel . I 'm the one who sent you the cello . It 's found its { \ * proper } home . It can bring people to you , like a siren 's song . - Compass ? - { \ * That seems to be } The key component in the mystery , enough for them to kill for . { \ * He 's gonna } He 'll tell me everything he knows about the carnival . We could isolate Samuel here . The problem , of course , is finding it . But our primary focus must be stopping Samuel . { \ * First , } You have to disappear for eight more weeks . { \ * Well , then } We 'll have to agree to disagree { \ * , Hiro } . { \ $ Must rescue Watson ... } { \ $ Beam me up , Scotty ... } { \ $ We must go to the swamp dragons and find the Castle ! } { \ $ That is how we will rescue Dr. Watson ! } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ $ You want to go to a place called Arkham in Florida ? } The craziness over the last few weeks is finally over . Sylar 's gone . - Who is she ? - Vanessa . The love of my life . - Haven 't seen her around here . - She 's out there . I 'm afraid she 'll reject me for who I am , for what I 've done . You 're still her father . You 're the only one she has left and she needs you . { \ * You know , } The thing about burnt bridges is they can be rebuilt . Look at her . How do I explain the world to her { \ * How do I explain to her about the world } without dampening her spirits ? Now she sees it filled with promise and hope , as bright as the light in her eyes . But I 've lived long enough to know that everything is not as it appears . Evil does exist . People do terrible things to one another . Oh , God . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God . I 'm still your brother . How do I protect her without losing her ? Hasn 't your father lied , cheated , even killed , to protect you ? How do I build a bridge between us ... - You lied to me . - We shouldn 't have { \ * done it } . When the distance seems so vast ? I need time to grieve without being reminded why . So much for his eighth grade class . Who 's next ? We 're getting down to childhood playmates { \ * , Noah } . - If that 's what it takes . - I 'm just saying , { \ * All I 'm saying is , } { \ * are you sure this is } is this a productive use of our time ? - I 've got to find this guy { \ * , Lauren } . - And I want to help you . But we 've been shooting in the dark for { \ * , like , } six hours now . You got a better idea , I 'm all ears . It 's just that you 're starting to sound a little ... Obsessed ? - You could call Claire . - Not an option . She has a compass { \ * , Noah } . She can lead us right to { \ * the } ... I am not calling Claire . She 's angry at me { \ * right now } , and { \ * frankly , } she has every reason to be . { \ * She 's } In no mood to help her old man . - { \ * Well , } Maybe it 's time to patch things up . - Or to find a useful lead . { \ * Maybe it 's time we found a useful lead . } You don 't have to help me . { \ * If you don 't want to help me , you don 't have to . } I 'm ... We got a hit on Vanessa Wheeler . - Who ? - I told you about her . { \ * She 's the one that I told you about . } She grew up in the estate where his parents worked . The house that became a sinkhole . Looks like we have some still photos off a security camera . - Is that your man ? - That 's him . - You got a phone number ? - California area code . - Vanessa Wheeler ? - Yes ? Who 's calling ? My name is Bennet . Noah Bennet . I wanted to talk to you about Samuel Sullivan . - What 's this about ? - Just looking for him , and wondering if you 've heard from him lately . { \ * and I 'm wondering if you 've heard from him lately . } I 'm sorry . I don 't know anybody by that name . Really ? { \ * Because } He grew up on the estate that your family owned . Looks like I 'm going to California . Good luck with that . Good night . - Just writing a letter . - Anybody I know ? I 'm running low on ink supplies . If you 're going into town tomorrow , I need you to pick some things up . Of course . I know much has happened lately that 's difficult . Edgar . Hiro . Claire Bennet . Joseph . Not to mention Sylar . I 'm asking for your patience . I need you on my side . We 're so close now to realizing all our dreams . Our dreams , Samuel ? Or are they yours ? I made a list . Indigo . Umber . Linseed oil . - She 's beautiful . - Don 't worry . You 'll meet her soon enough . I 've waited a long , long time to bring her . The day has finally come . You don 't trust him , do you ? He 's planning something big , and I don 't like it . He 's always been good to me . Why would you cause trouble ? { \ * I don 't know why you want to cause trouble . } If this family is going to survive , we are going to need a new leader . - Like who ? - There is someone . A man of compassion . Samuel himself said that he may be the next Joseph . He 's just so far away . { \ * Well , } Maybe you can call him . Maybe I can . - Is Matty still asleep ? - { \ * Yeah . } He was up { \ * so } late watching Ratatouille . Speaking of which ... Tonight , for dinner ... ratatouille . - Really ? - { \ * Yeah . } I 'm looking at it . It 's not hard . { \ * I mean , it 's really not that hard . } { \ * You know , } My brother called yesterday . He 's still looking to hire someone . You don 't know of anyone , do you ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ * No . I mean , } I told you before , I don 't know any software salesmen . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ * You see , } He doesn 't need a computer guy . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Just someone who 's smart , focused { \ * and , you know } , looking to get ahead . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } - You don 't like my cooking ? - I love it . { \ * Matt , I love your cooking . } { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ * But } You want me to work for your brother . Seriously ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } - { \ * Honey , } Your brother ? - I 'm just worried about you . Since you got back , you hardly go out . { \ * you hardly leave the house . } { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ * Well , } I 'm a stay-at-home dad guy . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } That 's what I do . What 's wrong { \ * with that } ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Nothing . I just want you to be happy . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } There 's " stay because you want to " , and " because you 're scare not to " . { \ * There 's " stay at home because you want to , " and then there 's " stay at home because you 're scared not to , " } { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } { \ * and } I { \ * just } don 't know which one you are . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } I 'm the one who is really excited about this ratatouille recipe , { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } which , by the way , will be ready at 6 : 30 p.m. sharp . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * Honey , } I 'm really happy . { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ * I am , just } Being here , taking care of you and Matty . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Have a good day . { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } Go make some money , will you ? { \ pos ( 192,235 ) } I checked your security system . { \ * I thought I 'd check your security system . } Seems you 're not as safe as you think . I 've left you five messages . { \ pos ( 240,268 ) } What do you want { \ * , Bennet } ? I need your help . Do you know Samuel Sullivan ? { \ * Have you ever heard of a guy named Samuel Sullivan ? } { \ pos ( 240,230 ) } No , but even if I have , the last time I helped you , { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I got Sylar stuck in my head and I almost died . { \ * , you remember that ? } { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } It 's nasty out there { \ * , Matt } , { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } but ignoring the world doesn 't make it go away . { \ * But shoving your head in the sand doesn 't make the world go away . } { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } { \ * Yeah . Well , } You never know until you try . { \ * , do you ? } { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I 'm sorry about what you 've been through . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } The Sylar thing was a terrible idea . We all admit that . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } { \ * Look , } I stay home and lock my doors . I don 't see why that has to change . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Because this Sullivan guy , he 's a { \ * very } bad man . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Well , so is Bin Laden . - You 'll have to do better . { \ * So you 're gonna have to do better than that . } - He 's trying to recruit my daughter . { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } Okay , what 's your plan ? Kick him in the teeth instead of talk to your daughter ? { \ * Are you gonna go kick this guy in the teeth instead of talking to your daughter ? } { \ pos ( 192,215 ) } I 'm sorry . { \ pos ( 260,235 ) } Today it 's Claire . Tomorrow , it could be your son . { \ $ What was I thinking ? } { \ $ Having you committed ... } { \ $ Your brain is scrambled , you don 't have your powers ... } { \ $ Once you 're inside , it won 't be easy to get you out . } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ $ Sancho , we must liberate Dr. Watson . } All right , time to kiss bye bye . Patients only past the double doors . { \ pos ( 192,205 ) } { \ $ Sancho , Arkham , Dr. Watson ... I wish I knew what any of this meant . } Can 't I at least see him to his room , make sure he 's comfortable ? Comfortable . Come on , pal . Let 's get you strapped in . - What ? - Just an expression . { \ $ It 's Dr. Watson ! } Ahmadi ? { \ $ " Dr. Watson " is Suresh . } - How long are these rehearsals { \ * , anyway } ? - I have no idea . Okay , so she plays the cello , she 's in the L.A. chamber orchestra , and she 's first chair . - What is she , Samuel 's girlfriend { \ * or something } ? - { \ * Well , } That 's what you 're here for { \ * , Matt } . That 's her , right there . { \ * Looks like } Rehearsal 's over . Jump in anytime . What ? No , I never ... Vanessa Wheeler ? - Do I know you ? - { \ * I 'm } Noah Bennet . We spoke on the phone { \ * briefly } . I called you about Samuel Sullivan . I thought I was clear . I told you , I don 't know him . We know that you do . We have pictures of the two of you . { \ * Yeah , the problem is that we know that you do because we have pictures of the two of you . } - Are you with the police ? - No . It 's more complicated than that . Is there somewhere that we could go and sit down and talk for a minute ? Whoever you are , please leave me alone . { \ * Look , whoever you are , just , please leave me alone . } Hang on { \ * just } a second . Have you met my friend Matt Parkman ? No ! And I don 't want to . { \ * Matt , } You want to share any thoughts here , please ? { \ * No , } I told you { \ * I } ... You can trust us , Vanessa . You want to talk to us . { \ * You know , } Come to think of it , I 'm glad you called . I need to talk to someone . I 'm worried about him . { \ * Hey , } Noah , it 's Peter . { \ * Look , that , uh ... } That tattoo on my arm , it showed up again . Give me a call , all right ? Bye . It worked ! I 'm sorry . What worked ? I brought you here with music . I just had to think of you , and it worked . I 'm sorry . { \ * Please , } Come in . I met an unusual man , and he showed me a new side to my ability , using this . - Where did you get this cello ? - That same man . - He 's the one who sent it to me . - Who ? What 's his name ? Samuel . Why ? I woke up this morning with this . They were good years , growing up . He used to write me these poems , these little love poems . We were close . Neither of us cared that his family lived in the carriage house on my family 's property or that his father called my father " sir . " One day I came home and they were gone . I moved on with my life . - I assumed he moved on with his . - But he hadn 't . He showed up in my room one night , all swagger and rock and roll . I was just in the right place for the bad boyfriend . We had a wild couple of weeks , till he asked me to marry him and run off to his carnival . I mean , a carnival ? I was getting a music degree at Yale . He 's not that 20-year-old kid anymore . Samuel Sullivan is a very dangerous man . { \ * Well , } Lately he has been showing up more and more often . Since his brother died , it 's gotten even worse . He just shows up , spouting all kinds of crazy things . - So he 's stalking you ? - That 's not the word I would choose , but he does seem ... Obsessed ? A week ago , he was waiting for me in the lobby of my apartment building . Going on and on about how much he misses me , how we 'll be together once I see how powerful he 's become . It was 2 : 00 in the morning . So he knows where you live and you know how to reach him ? I 've been banging my head { \ * against the wall } , trying to { \ * figure out how to } find the carnival . Maybe we bring the carnival to us . { \ * Okay . } How do you move a carnival ? Do us a favor . Call him . Is this the guy that gave you the cello ? Who said his name was Samuel ? Yes . You know him ? He told me his name was William Hooper . - What did he want from you ? - He didn 't want anything . - Just to find a homeless man . - That 's it ? He gave me something . This . { \ * Emma , } The last time I saw a compass like this , my friend got stabbed . - You think Samuel ... - If there 's any connection to that , I 'd keep my distance from him . { \ * Peter , } He 's a good man . { \ * Emma , } My friend almost died because of a compass just like that . { \ * And } He wasn 't the first { \ * person that got } to get attacked . Delmonico 's for lunch . Or maybe it 'll be too crowded . How about Moxie ? Hi , Mom . Emma , this is my mother , Angela . - Nice to meet you . - Mom , this is Emma . { \ * Peter , } How do you know this woman ? Emma is my friend . I need to get to work . Bye , Peter . I 'll call you later . What the hell was that ? { \ $ So this has been about saving Dr. Suresh , all along . } { \ $ As I 've been telling you , Sancho Panza ! } { \ $ Hiro , I am so relieved . That your mind ... } { \ $ That you 're not really crazy . I 've misjudged you once again . } { \ $ But Dr. Suresh has super-strength ... } { \ $ Why hasn 't he broken out ? } { \ $ - The storm troopers ... - The orderlies ... } { \ $ Have dulled his senses ... with Jawa Juice . } { \ $ He 's been drugged . } { \ pos ( 192,220 ) } { \ $ We must turn Bruce Banner back into the Hulk ! } { \ $ You 've done well so far . } { \ $ Now leave it to me . } - How 's it going ? - All good . Messing with my meds ? { \ * You better not be messing with my meds . } I was just admiring your cart . Very nice . I work in a cart factory . You 're the Japanese guy 's friend . I 'm Buck . Excuse me . I 'm Chuck . Take it easy . { \ $ Nap time for Sancho . } He 's late . We 're pretty exposed { \ * here , Noah } . - { \ * So } When he shows , we 've got to hustle . - Taser and { \ * some } duct tape and we 're out in 60 seconds . { \ * You } Getting a hit on the chip in her pocket ? Yeah , it 's all good . - We have our target . - What ? { \ * Well , } He didn 't come past me . He came around the back . { \ * He must have come around the back . } - And let 's go . - Copy that . Can I ask you a question ? - What was that ? - The alley . Get the car ! Got it . Where is she ? Stay away from her { \ * Bennet } . - Where is she ? - She 's already gone . What the hell happened to you ? { \ * All right , } She 's headed south on Normandie . Let 's go . You had a dream . There 's nothing you can do to save her . You need to save yourself . I 'm sorry . { \ * Mom , } Half this family is dead . Their bodies are surrounded with lies . It 's down to you and me . Are we ever gonna get this right ? Please , just tell me the truth . For once in your life , Mom , please . The dream was foggy . The message was not . She 's gonna help kill people . That 's wrong . { \ * Mom , } That 's not possible . { \ * , okay ? } She 's a good person . { \ * Peter , } She 's gonna kill thousands of people . It will be a bloodbath . { \ * A cello . } Something to do with a cello . Tell me exactly what you saw . { \ * I told you , } It doesn 't matter . The important thing is that you cannot save her . But someone else can . Is that it ? I 'm sorry . I need to know . People think that dreaming the future is a gift . They 're wrong . Dr. Watson ! Dr. Watson ! Hulk ! Dr. Watson , I have traveled over great oceans to free you ! Where am I ? - You put me here ! - To be continued . Beware the Stormtroopers ! Why are you talking like that { \ * , Hiro } ? Warp speed , Dr. Watson . We must rescue Sancho and escape . The prisoners have all gone to dinner . I 've hidden Sancho for his safety . Ando ? What 's happened to him ? He partook of the absinthe intended for you { \ * , Dr. Watson } . Perfect . One who can 't walk , one who can 't talk . They must have searched my cell . Let 's go . { \ * We 've got to go . } We shall ride to freedom . What 's happening ? - It 's like swimming but inside out . - Silencio ! I 'm swimming ! Warp speed , Captain ! Get back in your cages ! - Stormtroopers ! - There they are ! It 's okay . I 've got this . What the ... She 's here . She 's right here . The carnival was here . { \ * Yeah ? Well , } It isn 't here now . They had { \ * , like , } a two-minute lead on us . A { entire } carnival doesn 't just disappear . This one does . - { \ * Well , } How did Claire find it ? - Gotta have a compass . { \ * Okay , so you 're saying } She got that from the Samuel guy ? - She got it from me . - Great . - { \ * Okay , well , then } Let 's go back to Claire { \ * then } . - It 's not gonna work that way . You 're burning bridges { \ * , Noah } . You can 't talk to Claire anymore , so tell me , - how is it gonna work then ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know . But we 're gonna find it . Somehow . We have to . Lauren , it 's me . Just call me . - I 'm running out of ideas { \ * here } . - Well , { \ * you know what ? } I would love to sit and brainstorm with you . { \ * I really would . } But I 've got to make dinner . - Yeah . Ratatouille . - What ? Ratatouille . It 's French . { \ * It 's in the book } I know what ratatouille is . This woman 's been kidnapped . - It 's a missing person . { \ * Well , that It 's a missing persons case . } - We must find her . { \ * And we have to find her . } { \ * I don 't have a badge anymore . } Let the cops handle it . { \ * You 're gonna } Send cops up against specials ? { \ * They 're gonna get } They 'll be flayed alive . { \ * Look , } I dragged her into this . I pulled her into the sunlight . { \ * Well , } Maybe she 's { \ * already } crossed state lines { \ * , Noah } . Look , I mean , admit it . - This is bigger than us . - What will you do ? { \ * So what are you gonna do ? } Are you just gonna lock your doors and crawl back into your shell ? You 're one of the good guys { \ * , Matt } . You have a responsibility . You 're not a coward . You know , some days ... maybe you { \ * just } can 't save the whole world . Some days , it 's better to just get your house in order . { \ * Some days , you 're better off just getting your own house in order . } Which means what ? Which means ... Go home . Hug your little girl . Don 't worry . I 've come to save you . - What are you doing ? - { \ * I 'm } Sorry . - What is wrong with you ? - Let me explain . I have these ... dreams that come true , and I had one about you and that cello . You broke my cello - because { \ * you had } of a dream ? - Because { \ * a lot of } people are gonna die . Your friend , Samuel . That compass that you have . My tattoo . - They 're { \ * all } connected to this cello . - I loved it { \ * that cello } ! We have to stop that dream from happening . { \ * And we have to make sure to stop that dream from happening . } That 's why I broke the cello . { \ * , okay ? } Something bad is going to happen . I want you out . Now ! I 'm sorry { \ * . I } ... Goodbye , Peter . I think that way is West . We must away , before the Stormtroopers are upon us . I have had { \ * just } about enough of your nonsense { \ * , Hiro } . After what you did { \ * to me } , { \ * I have half a mind } I want to leave you lost in this swamp { \ * forever } . Hey , don 't talk to him like that . { \ * Hiro } He has { \ * got } very little time left , and he chose to spend it rescuing you . - { \ * You should } Be thankful . He 's a hero . - What do you mean , " little time ? " - The reaper waits for no man . - He 's dying . The Stormtroopers and their Ewoks ! Hurry ! Are you sure he can 't teleport ? Not unless we unscramble his brain . - What would they have done ? { \ * at that hospital ? } - Probably electroshock therapy . - Why are we stopping ? - Electroshock therapy . - { \ * What , } You want me to ... - Even if we evade { \ * them } , we 'd wander for days . { \ we could be wandering out here for days . } - We need to teleport out of here . - How ? You can use your red lightning . { \ * Look , } Hiro { \ * once } saw a future where I killed him with my red lightning . - Was it in Florida ? - Japan . Then we 're good to go . Make it so , Sancho . - We must stop Samuel Sullivan ! - { \ * Hiro , } You 're back ! Yes . And now , we must get going . Dad ? { \ * I 'm } Sorry to bother you . I was { \ * just } in the neighborhood . Really ? I was in California . I just landed . Bags are still in the car . { \ * Listen , } I know { \ * that } you 're mad at me and I 'm okay with that . And , I want to just let you be mad at me . I don 't want to talk you out or convince you of anything . { \ I don 't want to try to talk you out of anything or to try to convince you of anything . } Dad , what are you doing here ? - Are you all right ? - Yeah , I 'm good . I 'm great , actually . I 'm just ... I 'm thinking about bridges . Bridges ? Bridges that connect us to the people and things that we love and need in our lives . They 're built on trust , and I 've ... I 've torched most of them . And I 'm just hoping that the ... that the one that connects me to you can still be repaired . I 'm sorry , but I do have something that I 'm late for . - Can we talk about this later ? - Yeah . We 'll talk about it later . This thing that you 're late for , do you need a lift ? No , I 'm good . - I 'll see you later ? - Yeah . I 'll see you later . I didn 't think a law office could be such a soap opera . { \ * I mean , } The human drama of it all . { \ * Matt , you } Remember my boss , Pressman ? { \ * So } He 's totally gay , he 's totally in denial , and he 's totally married . This is delicious . So how about you ? Did you leave the house at all today ? Do you think I 'm a coward ? What ? I think I 'm a coward . What are you talking about ? Why ? I had the worst guy { \ * in the world } living inside my head . When I finally got rid of him , I didn 't do a thing to go after him . Because you came home to us , where you belong . I 've let so many people down . Who ? Friends , people that I care about . I mean , I 'm sitting here , eating ratatouille , instead of facing the world , doing something about the problems that I 've caused . You have a family . { \ * Come on , } You 're a simple guy . You care about us . That 's your world . You { \ * just } have to let the rest of it be . There is nothing cowardly about looking after your family . You belong here with us . Come here . Not exactly five-star accommodations , { \ * I know , } but if there 's anything you need ... What I need is to go home , Samuel . What are you doing ? You can 't just take me . I 've thought about this day for so long { \ * , Vanessa } . The day you would arrive . It wasn 't supposed to be like this . { \ * Everything } It was supposed to be perfect . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Noah Bennet . He did a real number on you . { \ * , didn 't he ? } He got into your head . I had { \ * to act , } to protect you , to get you away from him . By kidnapping me ? I wouldn 't say that . { \ * I would hardly say that . } You won 't let me leave { \ * here } . You 've got me against my will . What would you call it ? You know what ? I 'm just ... You 're upset . And I understand why . But there is a reason for all of this . There 's something I want you to see . It 's so magical , so beautiful . { \ * Just } Let me show you , that 's all . If you 're still unhappy , I 'll take you { \ * right } back to California { \ * , I promise } . What do you mean , " { \ * right } back to California { \ , " Sam } ? " Where are we ? It 's so beautiful , Vanessa . Wait till you see it . It 's perfect . I was driving by . I saw the light on . Come on in . How was California ? Not as fruitful as I would have liked . - You got my messages ? - Yeah . I 'm sorry . I know . And I think I ... I care for you more than I want to admit . And it 's complicated . I know . Just don 't do it again . You have company . Sorry to pop in like this . Hello , boys .

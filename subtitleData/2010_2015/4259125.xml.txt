 - Happy birthday . - [ woman ] Happy birthday , darling ! - [ woman laughs ] - [ man ] Whoo-hoo ! - [ man ] Look at that . - [ woman ] Happy birthday . [ man ] Wow . Wait , wait , wait . Don 't blow them out just yet . Hon , give me the camera , and I 'll , um , get a shot - of you and Caitlyn blowing them out . - [ woman ] OK . - And ... - [ blowing ] - Oh , my God . - [ man ] Good girl . - [ man ] Well done . - Happy birthday . - All in one go . - Come on , give it back . - [ man ] Don 't forget to make your wish . - [ Caitlyn ] I wish for ... [ woman gasps ] You 're not supposed to tell us your wishes . I wish the lights would come back on . [ man ] They will , my darling , don 't worry about that . [ Caitlyn ] I need to go toilet . [ man ] OK . Well , quickly then . You gotta cut this cake . [ woman ] Hurry up . [ man ] Don 't go near that front door , though , OK ? Stay away from that front door . - l will . - Good girl . [ sighs ] [ woman ] Look , we can 't keep this up , Tom . She knows something 's wrong . Why don 't we take the Land Rover to the village ? No . Look , they told us to stay here . Whatever it is out there , it 's contagious . I 'm sure they 'll send someone when it 's all sorted . And we 've got enough stuff here to be getting on with anyway . It 'll be fine , honestly . [ woman ] I 'm not ... I 'm not sure . I don 't know . We 'll be fine . [ woman ] Oh , my God . What was that ? [ Tom ] I don 't know . Let me have a look . [ woman ] Can you see anything ? [ Tom ] lt 's so dark out there , I can 't see a thing . Bring that camera with you so I 've got a bit more light . [ woman ] OK , but be careful . I think there 's something in the river . [ woman ] What 's that ? Caitlyn , just get back in the house , please , darling ? Go on . Everything 's OK . I 'm gonna take a look . [ woman ] Tom , just get back inside the house . It 's fine. lt 's fine . I 'll just take a quick look . [ rustling ] [ woman ] Careful . [ water sloshes ] - Did you hear that ? - [ woman ] What was it ? I 'm not sure . [ woman ] Tom . Hold on . [ woman groans ] [ woman ] You see anything ? Tom ? [ water sloshing ] [ woman ] Great . [ woman sighs ] [ water sloshing ] [ sighs ] [ woman screaming ] [ woman panting , gasping ] [ woman whimpering ] Where is she ? [ whispering ] Caitlyn ? Caitie ? Oh no , God , please . Caitlyn ? [ sobbing ] Baby , where are you ? Caitlyn ? [ sobbing ] Oh , God , there ... Thank God , there you are . Are you all right , darling ? Let me see . Let me see . Are you OK ? - lt 's OK , sweetheart . - Mommy ... [ woman whispering ] Just be quiet , OK ? Hug Bunny , hug Bunny close . Just be quiet . - [ thumping , glass shatters ] - Oh , God . Shh . Shh . Everything 's gonna be OK . Just be quiet . Please . - [ banging ] - [ stifled sobbing ] Oh , my God . - [ glass shatters ] - Shh , shh ... - l 'm here , I 'm here . - [ banging , footsteps ] - [ Caitlyn whimpers ] - Shh , shh ! - Mom ? - Baby , you have to be so quiet . - Be quiet . Shh , shh . - [ Caitlyn whimpering ] - lt 's gonna be OK . Shh ... - [ thumping ] I know , I know . Shh , shh . [ faint wheezing , moaning ] [ woman pants ] - [ footsteps approach ] - [ flies buzzing ] - [ low growling ] - [ woman screams ] [ roaring ] [ off-air tone drones ] [ exhales ] My name 's Nick Jones . I 'm an army photographer with the Platoon of the East Anglia and Fourth Battalion . Our current location is a military outpost in Hertfordshire , United Kingdom . The tape you just saw was something we picked up a few weeks ago whilst we were out on the road . We 've seen some pretty bad stuff in the past few months , just like what you saw with that family . So it 's been about four months since the outbreak , and we 're still alive . And , uh ... that 's exactly what I 'm trying to document . So I 'll show you around the place , introduce you to some of the guys . We 're all TA in the platoon , so we 're all reservists . To give you an idea , though ... Maddy over there is a truck driver . Johno is a bloody financial advisor . At the end of the day , we 're just normal people . We were on exercise when this thing took hold . So we were drafted in by the army to secure certain areas , which we did . So , we 've seen a lot of horrible stuff , though . Really horrible . [ Jones ] And your training , I presume , must 've helped you and the platoon survive ? Absolutely . But nothing really prepares you for when it really happens . You can 't plan for this sort of stuff . So we 're just living day by day at the moment , trying to help each other out . Everyone 's lost pretty much everyone , so it 's just us . [ Jones ] Are you scared ? We 're all afraid . Anyone who says they 're not afraid is either lying or needs their fucking head examined . Sorry . [ Jones ] Lieutenant Andrews , you 're in command of this platoon and the outpost . Can you tell us a bit about where we are ? Well , the entire country 's in utter chaos . There 's no law . There 's just bands of survivors like us . As you can see , we 've got perimeter fencing , not fool-proof , though , but stops those things from getting in . There 's a water supply nearby and there 's limited power from the generators . I think you found that useful for your camera . - What happened , Corporal ? - We had contact , sir . One casualty , Private O 'Hara . - Wounded ? - Dead , sir . It was Hatchworth . The place is crawling with those things . Take O 'Hara 's body to sickbay . We need to bag him up properly . - Sir . - [ truck engine revving ] - Do you mind , Nick ? - He 's a bit shaken up , man . [ man ] Fuckin ' sick of this shit . [ Andrews ] lt was meant to be a simple raid . into the town , straight in , straight out , job done . Now I 've got another man dead . Second in a week . Sir , I 'll be honest with you . These raids are getting too dangerous . There were far more than we 've encountered before . O 'Hara ... O 'Hara fucked up and got himself killed . - He was just a kid . - l don 't want to hear it , Maddox . The boys get one chance out here . Now it 's the same for everyone . You take your eye off the ball , this is what happens . It 's only a few klicks from here , sir . Look , I 'd like your input this evening . [ Maddox ] Sir . This is where they brought the civilians in . - [ coughing ] - [ moaning ] [ heart monitor beeping ] [ Jones ] Fucking hell . [ coughing , gagging ] [ Jones ] Jesus Christ . Doc . Damn it . Nurse . If you want to be useful , Jones , get the nurse for me . [ Jones ] That all , sir ? Do me a favor and get out of here with that thing . - [ man ] Yeah . - [ man 2 ] Yeah . See you out there . [ Jones ] Hey , guys . What happened at Hatchworth ? It was all fucked up , mate . We were loading our food and supplies from a store when several of those things came at us . O 'Hara was outside on his own . Didn 't see ' em coming . No good after you 're bitten . Shot himself before he turned . - [ man ] You sure that 's what it says ? - [ man 2 ] Mm-hm . [ Andrews ] This part of the message stays between us . - l don 't want to cause alarm . - Good . Jonesy . - l 'm sorry about earlier , Jonesy . - [ Jonesy ] That 's OK . It 's just that ... that while in there , she 's not going to last much longer . Same for most of them . Had to lock O 'Hara 's body in a storeroom till morning . What a bloody mess . [ Jonesy ] What about her ? [ doctor ] I 've had to keep her sedated and locked up . Been prone to violent attacks . [ Jonesy ] Yeah , I can see that . It looks like you came off worse . Yeah . I 'll be honest with you . If she were an animal , I 'd put her down . There 's no specialists left to give her what she needs . [ slow , muffled breathing ] [ alarm blaring ] [ panting ] Just heard word from Corporal Nicholson . We got contact at the perimeter . Why are these fucking gates open ? ! [ siren wailing ] [ Andrews ] Nicholson , are you seeing this ? [ Nicholson ] Sir , I don 't know how , but they breached the compound . [ Andrews ] Shit . No choice . We have to engage . [ Nicholson ] Sir . Engage ! Engage ! [ gunfire ] [ man ] God damn you , fire ! [ Jonesy ] Help me ! No ! Fuck no ! [ shouting ] Help me ! No ! - Fall back ! - Outflank ' em ! [ continued screaming , gunfire ] [ Jonesy ] Someone ! Help me ! Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! [ alarm blaring ] [ doctor ] Jonesy ! [ man screaming ] [ doctor ] Help . Help . [ Jonesy ] Turner ! Turner ! Jesus . God . - [ woman screaming ] - [ alarm continues blaring ] [ Jonesy screams ] Jones , you all right ? [ Jonesy ] Yeah . Sickbay 's fucked , everyone 's dead . - We 're getting out of here . - [ Jonesy ] How ? We 're taking one of the trucks . This whole place is compromised now . We 'll get as much weapon and ammunition as we can . - You got a sidearm ? - [ Jonesy ] No . You know how to use it . - [ woman ] We need find Carter ! - [ man ] I haven 't seen him . [ Maddox ] See if you can grab anyone from the other side of the barracks . If Carter 's there , get him . We 're leaving . [ Jonesy ] OK . OK . [ alarm , siren continuing ] - [ Jonesy ] Maddox ! - [ alarm silences ] Maddox ! Quick . Give me a hand . - We can 't leave her . - We can 't . She 's a liability . [ Jonesy ] What , you want to be a murderer ? Just ... Just help her ! - [ Maddox ] All right , stand back . - [ fires gun ] [ siren wailing ] [ woman shouts , whimpers ] [ Maddox ] Listen to me ! We are getting out of this place . I need you to do as I say . You understand ? Understand ? ! OK . Let 's go . [ rapid gunfire ] [ Jonesy ] Maddox ! Where 's Andrews ? We 're taking the truck ! Last time I saw him , he was on the other side . And the main gate 's been breached . We need to bug out . [ woman ] We 're not leaving without Carter ! [ Nicholson ] I can 't see shit out here , Kayne ! [ Jonesy ] There he is ! Carter ! [ Kayne ] Stop ! - [ zombie growling ] - [ Jonesy ] Andrews ! Oh , fuck , they 're everywhere . Nicholson , what the fuck are you doing ? ! I 'm gonna draw them away so you can get the truck out . [ Jonesy ] You 're fucking mad . All of you , back to the truck , now ! [ Jonesy ] Stay behind us ! Jonesy , move it ! Move it ! Jones , come on , come on , come on . [ Jonesy ] We need to wait for Nicholson . We gotta go . We gotta go now . [ gunfire ] [ Jonesy ] Nicholson ! Nicholson ! Nicholson ! [ panting ] We 're just leaving the base . We left Nicholson behind . Fuck ... Oh , God , Nicholson . He 's left behind . Um ... Someone left the gate open . [ pants ] I don 't know who the fuck did that , but the gate is left open . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ Jonesy ] Are you OK ? [ Kayne ] We shouldn 't be taking her . [ Jonesy ] She wouldn 't have made it otherwise . That ain 't my problem . The girl was locked up . She 's crazy . - She 'll slow us down . - [ Maddox ] Knock it off . She 's with us now , so get used to it . You sure you 're OK ? I 'm Corporal Maddox , by the way . What 's your name ? Leeann . Here . Put this on . [ Maddox ] You were quite handy back there . You almost took my head off . You 've met Jonesy already ? This is Kayne . She 's a good soldier , same goes for Carter up front . They 'll protect you . We 're gonna try and find somewhere safe , OK ? [ wind howling ] This place should be all right. lt 's in our recon area , if the others make it . Too dangerous to drive with those things around , Corporal . Yeah , I agree . They must be all over the place by now . The truck 's out of sight . Gone down quiet , though . Yeah , too quiet . And the weather 's closing in . [ wind howling ] [ Maddox ] We need to gain entry . [ Carter ] Don 't worry. I 've got a key . [ Maddox whispers ] Go . Go . [ wind howling outside ] Kayne ... check the place out . We need to secure the location , make it as hard as possible for those things to get in . [ Carter ] Area clear . Pretty hairy back there , eh ? - Seen worse . - Mm . She does speak . [ laughs ] So , Jonesy tells me you 're some kind of reporter . That 's right . Where from ? London . So how did you end up out here ? Leave her out , Carter . Her friends were attacked . [ Leeann ] My friends were murdered . No one here is gonna hurt you . OK ? Yeah . Whatever . Hm ... It 's beautiful . [ Jonesy ] What is ? Snow . I 've never seen it before . [ Jonesy ] Oh , wow. I didn 't realize . Uh , Maddox needs you inside . Let 's go . [ Maddox ] I want you to see this . You , too , Leeann . This involves all of us . I managed to take this from the base before it was overrun . Now , I 'm sure you all heard about the messages we 'd been receiving . Well , Andrews worked out it was coming from Hope 's Point on the east coast . - Survivors ? - Yeah . - [ Carter ] There 's no one there . - That 's what we thought , but there are . - And there 's a lot more in Holland . - [ Kayne ] Holland ? There 's a large community over there who have got a plan to sit this thing out over winter . Now , ten klicks from our position is Hinxston Forest . It 's the best way to avoid the towns . If we take the road through the forest and stick to the country route to the coast , then regroup with the survivors at Hope , then we get over to Rotterdam and hold out till spring . This is Andrews 's last orders . Andrews is gone , Maddox . We should be heading north , not to the coast . You need to forget about Manchester . - We 've all lost people , Carter . - Hope Point is crazy . There 's nothing left for us here . And look at what you 're wearing . We 're more hated than those creatures . After what happened in the beginning ... We had orders . So did you . - l didn 't wanna do it . - Yeah , I know , none of us did . But people blame the likes of us after what happened . We run into a group of survivors who have all lost loved ones , they 'll most likely lynch you . We 're a symbol of that old authority . Whether you like it or not , we are better off moving now . - You 're wrong . - This whole country is fucked . What are you gonna do ? You gonna throw down your rifle and pretend you 're a civvie like everyone else ? Use your head , man . Rotterdam ? Uh ... Fuck . [ wind howling outside ] [ distant thumping ] [ clock ticking ] [ Jonesy ] Carter . Keep it down , mate . They 're outside . [ Jonesy ] Shit . Started coming by about an hour ago , just hanging around . [ Jonesy ] They better not try and get in . - They don 't know we 're here . - [ thumping ] [ Jonesy ] What was that ? Stay on me . [ Carter sighs ] [ faint thumping ] [ Jonesy ] lt 's coming from down there . [ Carter whispers ] I hear it , mate . Keep it down . [ thumping ] [ Jonesy ] Be careful , Carter . There 's a door . On three . One ... two ... and three . Slowly . OK . OK . I 'm not sure about this . [ Carter ] Shh . [ Jonesy ] lt 's not good . Leave it . OK . OK . [ thumping ] [ Carter ] Jonesy , what 's that sound ? - [ flies buzzing ] - [ Jonesy ] Carter , shit ! - [ Carter ] Fuck . - Behind me , out . [ Jonesy ] Go , go , go , go , go ! Behind me . [ panting , whispers ] Jesus . We need to get out of here . - [ Carter ] lt 's a fucking death trap . - l know . They 're everywhere outside . [ glass shatters ] - They 'll get in . - OK , we 've got no choice . We 're bugging out . Head around to the truck . - Don 't engage with weapons . - [ Carter ] Got it . Jonesy , get in the back . - Look out ! - [ zombie growling ] [ Carter grunts ] [ grunting ] [ discordant industrial sounds play ] - [ Carter ] Fuck . - [ Leeann ] What 's happening ? - [ Kayne ] The ride is over . - All right , everyone out . [ fires gun ] - [ Carter ] Truck 's totaled . - Fuck it . - [ Leeann ] Oh , Jesus . - All right , on me . Let 's move . Kayne , watch from the tree line . I don 't think they 're gonna come this far . [ Carter ] Christ . What now , man ? - [ Jonesy ] Are you OK ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . [ Carter ] Fuck . Hold the perimeter . There 's a shallow river up ahead , and make sure everyone gets their canteens filled . - Jonesy , use the purifying tablets . - [ Jonesy ] Yep . [ muffled breathing ] [ wind howling ] - How 's everyone down at the camp ? - [ Jonesy ] Yeah , not bad . You get any sleep ? [ Jonesy ] A little bit . Damn weather though . Yeah , it 's fucking cold . This is no good . We stand out like sore fucking thumbs . [ Jonesy ] So you really want to leave the country ? Don 't get me wrong , mate . I understand people wanna find out how their loved ones are , but ... We have to assume they 're dead . I want to show you something . [ whispers ] lt 's just down there . [ Jonesy ] Jesus . [ Maddox ] We are not alone out here . Somebody didn 't just kill this creature . They enjoyed it . OK . Let 's head back to the camp . Jones , keep this between ourselves , yeah ? [ clicking ] [ Jonesy ] Where 'd you get that thing ? My grandfather was a collector . Been in the family for years . [ Maddox ] All right , so what have we got ? Got the two SA80s with four mags , one pistol , one clip , one shotgun , several shells , my rifle , my Mauser . No grenades , though . Not much , is it ? Best way to deal with these creatures is to avoid them . That should be enough to get us to Hope 's Point . [ Kayne ] Then what ? We 'll be OK . - l can shoot . - [ Kayne ] You ? Used to go shooting with my dad . Made the county finals a few years back . Now I 've heard it all . Leeann , you 're under our protection for now . [ Carter ] Guys , look at this ! It must have been there for weeks . [ Jonesy ] Fucking hell , it 's everywhere . You forgetting something ? We all fucking drank from here last night . - [ Leeann ] Oh , God . [ gags ] - Everyone , calm down . [ Kayne ] lt 's OK . Our boot marks , upstream . It 's all right . - [ Jonesy ] That 's lucky . - Too fucking lucky . No point in polluting the rest of this fucking area . [ grunting ] So , what are we doing about transport ? Well , we can forget about the truck . Getting a new vehicle means heading into a town or village , and I don 't wanna risk that . We proceed on foot . [ Carter ] Come on , man . Private , I want all the kits squared and ready to go . We head to Hinxston Forest as planned . We need to get some distance between this place and us . [ Leeann ] Carter ! [ Jonesy ] Trip wire . Careful . [ Maddox ] Kayne , check it out . It 's a crossbow . Bandits . I 'll disarm it . Whoa ! Fuck ! Shit ! [ panting ] Carter , come back very slowly . We need to keep off the main paths . Do you fucking see this ? [ Carter ] Bandits . OK , on me , move . [ zombie hissing ] [ man shouts ] [ man singing indistinctly ] [ man ] Put your back into it , come on . - [ man ] Whoo ! [ laughs ] - [ engine revving ] [ man humming ] Fucking hell , Weasel . Have I got to show you where to put it ? Come on . Are you a fucking virgin ? Come on ! [ man 2 ] I hope you 're using fucking protection . Dirty bastard . Whoo ! [ man ] There we go . [ laughs ] OK . Now , Goke ... - Jesus Christ , live a little . - Problem ? I thought we were gonna fucking save her for Billy . Shut up . Jesus , Manny . Dirty fuck . Let 's go , come on . - [ Carter ] lt 's no good . - l can take them from here . [ Jonesy ] Leeann , you all right ? OK , let 's move . Kayne , take point . [ muffled breathing ] [ Jonesy ] What do you think ? We take the most direct route , straight through the forest . [ Jonesy ] I don 't know , Maddox . We 're not moving across open ground with bandits around . We need to move fast . Time is not on our side . [ Jonesy ] Yeah , I realize that . No , you don 't . Look , there 's something you all need to understand . We 've not got much time left . [ Jonesy ] What do you mean ? There are boats leaving for Rotterdam from Hope 's Point . They leave in two days , and they won 't wait . Two days , that 's all we 've got . [ Kayne ] What ? There 's something else . I haven 't said anything ' cause I don 't know if it 's true yet , but ... lf we don 't make it there in time , the chances of our survival in this country are gonna be zero . Kayne , you can 't say this to Carter . Why not ? He 's one of us . If what we heard happens , I know he will try and find his family , and he will die trying . I 'm sorry , but you 've gotta trust me on this . It 's not right . Kayne , we need him . - [ Maddox ] SlTREP . - Not good . The forest is fucking full of those things . [ Maddox ] Can we make it through ? All right , let 's move . [ whispers ] Come on , let 's go . - [ Leeann grunts ] - Leeann , I need your help . Take these . Kayne , Carter , right flank . Jones , Leeann , with me . - Prepare to move . - Ready . Ready . - Ready . - Move ! - Covering fire ! - [ Carter ] Go ! [ gunfire ] [ Carter ] Go ! Cover ! Covering fire ! [ Maddox ] On me ! Follow me ! [ panting ] [ Maddox ] Let 's get the fuck out of here . [ Leeann grunts ] [ all panting ] [ Kayne ] No sign . We 're clear for now . [ Maddox ] They 'll be following . These fuckers are slow , but they don 't give up . Leeann , you did good . - Maddox , I 'm freezing . - l know . Don 't worry , we 'll start a fire . This is a good place to rest . We can see anything coming . We 're close , maybe one or two klicks till we 're through the forest . We 'll come across a couple of villages . Good . Maybe we can find a set of wheels . Doubtful , but we do need food and water . This is pretty much the last of it . We 'll have a look at daybreak , but I 'm not taking any chances . I don 't like it out here . It feels too open . Be glad when we get to the coast . The people at Hope 's Point know what they 're doing . Yeah . I just wanna leave places like London behind now . [ Jonesy ] Have you got any family there ? Yeah . It scares me , the thought of ever going back . - Married ? - [ laughs ] No . Just Mom and Dad . I wanted a career back then . All seems so pointless now . [ Carter ] I had a wife and a daughter . Up in Manchester . Wish I knew where they are . Just need to find out what happened , you know ? [ Leeann ] Jonesy . Here , give me that . - [ Leeann ] So , what about you ? - What do you mean ? [ Leeann ] lt 's about time you tell us a bit about yourself ? [ Carter ] Yeah , mate , you 've been asking us a lot of questions . OK . My wife left me three years ago . Uh , I suppose it was my own fault , really . I was always away on work . [ Leeann ] Looks like you still are . Yeah . I suppose it 's all I got left now . But it 's important , isn 't it ? To document all this . [ Leeann ] Any other family ? Just my dad . He went to America a few years ago , and , uh I haven 't heard from him since Christmas . It was just a card . And no kids , actually . It 's a pretty good job , considering , isn 't it ? All this , what 's happened . - Don 't go asking Corp. - [ Leeann ] Why ? What 's the big secret ? It 's no secret . [ Leeann ] Well ? - You really wanna know ? - [ Leeann ] Yeah , I really wanna know . I was a schoolteacher . [ Leeann ] A teacher ? Are you serious ? Yeah . Taught geography to secondary school kids . Just a regular job like everyone else . But I 'll say this . Um ... I 'm sorry , Jonesy , but you 're wrong . Kids are our only hope now . That 's why it 's so important we find other survivors . If not , our generation 's gonna be the last , and things will never get back to the way they were . [ Leeann ] What about you , Kayne ? I look after him . Ha-ha . You fucks . [ Leeann ] Here . I 'm gonna go pee . Stay close . [ muffled breathing ] Leeann , you all right ? Leeann ? [ Carter ] Leeann ! [ man shouts ] lf any of those things eat her ... Fall back behind those trees . [ running footsteps ] - The cunts were just here . - Keep your fucking noise down . - They 're still around . - [ Leeann screaming ] I 'll let you go , though quickly this time , now . That 's it . You struggle . I like it rough ! [ both shouting ] - Fucking cunt . - [ grunts ] [ Manny ] Up we go then . - They can 't get far . - Traps will stop them . Ain 't that right , Billy ? [ Leeann shouts ] You 're a tough girl to get hold of , Leeann . Be still . Your friends at the base got a nice surprise last night , eh ? - Fucking animals ! - [ laughs ] [ Manny ] What are we gonna do with her ? [ Goke ] What do you think , Manny ? I 'm gonna fucking ruin her . You already been there , mate . No , we got something special in mind for you . - Haven 't we , Billy ? - [ Leeann spits ] [ Manny laughs , claps ] That wasn 't nice . Hold her down . [ Leeann ] No . No . - No ! - This cunt 's gonna get it . [ Leeann sobbing ] Stop . Please . - No ! - What are you wearing under there ? - [ Leeann sobbing ] - [ Manny cheers ] - [ gunfire ] - [ shouting ] Get ' em ! [ gunfire ] - [ Leeann sobbing ] - [ gunfire continues ] [ Maddox ] Keep your heads down ! Run point ! - Fucking run , Billy ! - [ Carter ] Run , I 'll hold them ! [ Maddox ] Keep them pinned down until we get clear , then you follow , that 's an order . Carter , keep a watch on your right flank . [ Carter ] Got it ! Go , go ! [ Maddox ] All round defense ! [ gunfire in distance ] [ panting ] [ Jonesy ] Leeann . I was listening to those wankers . They 're the ones , aren 't they ? Who did that to your friends ? - Yeah . - [ Jonesy ] Fuckers . We better across these fields and away from here now . No . We gotta wait for Carter . Look , Carter knows what he 's doing . We 've gotta go . [ Jonesy ] There he is ! I can see him . [ Carter groaning , shouting ] [ Kayne ] No ! [ Kayne grunting ] - [ Kayne yelling ] - [ zombie growls ] - [ Maddox ] Kayne , leave him ! - [ Kayne ] Carter ! - [ Carter grunting ] Kayne ... do me ! - [ zombies growling ] [ sobbing ] Do it ! Fucking do it ! [ Kayne screams , fires gun ] - [ Kayne sobbing ] - Kayne . You all right ? Look , I 'm sorry about Carter . [ sobbing ] He didn 't wanna come on this fucking mission . We 'll get through this . - We will get to safety . - lt 's fucked up . I know it is . But right now , I need you on your feet . They 'll be on us . Bring it on . [ gunfire in distance ] That 's Carter 's rifle . Fuckers . They 'll have their hands full for a while . They won 't find us in the dark if we keep moving . Come on . [ wind howling ] There 's a village up ahead . OK . We 're gonna try and find a vehicle . But the first sign of trouble , and we 're out of there . There could be hostiles around so keep your eyes peeled . Leeann , Jonesy , do not engage unless I say . OK . Stay sharp . [ whispers ] lt 's too fucking quiet . What do you see ? [ Jonesy whispers ] Nothing . All right , let 's head through . No sound . [ wind howling ] - [ zombie growls ] - [ panting ] lt 's no good ! Go , go , go ! What now ? - [ Kayne ] Fuck . - [ Maddox ] Go ! [ Maddox ] There 's a vehicle up ahead . [ Kayne ] Better be quick . They 'll be more of these . Kayne , keep us covered . [ engine chugging ] - Come on . - [ Jonesy ] Come on , Maddox . - Come on , come on , come on . Come on ! - Come on ! - Fuck ! - [ Jonesy ] Shit ! - [ zombie growling ] - [ flies buzzing ] [ Maddox ] Fuck . Fuckin ' ... Maddox ! - Leeann , try the Jeep again . - [ zombies growling ] [ gunshot ] [ Leeann ] We need to get out of this fucking village , now ! Kayne , come on , let 's move ! Kayne ! [ muffled screaming ] [ muffled crying ] [ muffled breathing ] Kayne , what 's up ? Something doesn 't feel right . [ Jonesy ] Scarecrows ? What the fuck ? You 're right . Something doesn 't feel right . Let 's move . On me . - [ Jonesy ] Do you think it 's them ? - lt 's them . I don 't know . We 're not waiting around to find out . Jones , Leeann , I want you two to head across to those trees on the other side . We 'll cover you . When you get there , you give covering fire to Kayne and I . - Understood ? Leeann ? - OK . Yeah . Keep low , move fast . Go , go . Too fucking close . - You OK ? - [ Jonesy ] Yeah . [ Kayne ] Go ! - Go ! - Go ! [ gunshot ] - [ Kayne screams ] - [ Jonesy ] Fuck ! Kayne ! [ gunfire ] [ Maddox ] We 'll get you out of this , now . Come on . [ gunfire ] [ Maddox ] Come on . Gonna get you out of this . [ groaning in pain ] Oh , fuck ! Tell me , how bad is it ? - Kayne , put pressure on it . - Oh ! [ screams ] - [ Maddox ] You 're gonna be all right . - [ groaning ] - lt 's gonna be all right . - [ Leeann ] Maddox , they 're coming . - Leave me here . Leave me here . - [ gunfire ] [ Maddox ] Not fucking happening . Come on . - Jonesy , keep the cover . - [ groaning ] Clear . [ muffled breathing ] I need one of you on lookout while I patch Kayne up . - [ Leeann ] I 'll go . - [ Jonesy ] Be careful . Fucking stings like hell . Man , never thought I 'd get shot . Fuck it . The sooner we get off this fucking island , the better . We just gotta get to the coast . We 're so close . [ Kayne ] We ain 't gonna make it , Maddox . Carter was right . [ Maddox ] I don 't wanna hear that . We 're gonna get out of this . Jonesy , get Leeann . We 're moving . [ Jonesy ] Leeann . Leeann , come on . We 're leaving . - [ grunting ] - Curtis .

Maddox . I think you gotta tell us everything you know . I heard you by the comms room with Andrews . - The other night . What was it ? - [ Nicholson ] Maddox ? [ Jonesy ] Well , what is it we weren 't supposed to tell Carter ? We heard a message on the radio about an operation to eradicate the threat , entirely . It seems the UK has been the hardest hit by this thing . And once those boats leave tomorrow that 's it . They 're calling it Operation Inferno . Pretty soon , this entire country is gonna be one big fucking graveyard . They can 't do that ! They can , and they will . [ distant rumbling ] [ Leeann ] lt 's already started . We 'll be at Hope 's Point by nightfall . Come on , let 's move . Give me that . Fifth Battalion . [ distant explosion ] [ muffled breathing ] [ Nicholson ] Jesus Christ . [ Leeann ] All of them . [ Jonesy ] They must have swarmed in . Overrun before they knew it . [ Leeann ] What ... What about the broadcast ? [ Maddox ] We need to go inside and check the radio bunker . There might still be survivors inside . Keep your eyes peeled , there may be hostiles around . It 's not over yet . OK , Nicholson . You wait for us here , keep a lookout . You see anything at all , you let us know . Copy that . [ Leeann ] Oh , my God . Last stand . This leads down to the comms room . Stay sharp . [ wind howling ] [ Jonesy ] What the fuck 's that ? [ Maddox ] Must lead further down into the complex . OK . [ Jonesy ] Oh , my God . What the fuck is going on ? [ Maddox ] Jesus Christ . [ Leeann ] We are the last , aren 't we ? What do we do now , Maddox ? We can get to the boats . We can still get out of this . Come on , move it . [ Jonesy ] They 're all gone , no one 's left . [ Maddox ] We can still get out of this . Jones , you and I will head down the beach . We 'll check on the boats , - and we 'll move at first light . - Maddox ! There 's no one left . We need to hold this bunker . I 'm still following orders ! This island is dead ! Jones , I need your help . Corporal Nicholson . Jez , Jez , I need you to stay with Leeann until we return . [ Jonesy ] I don 't get it . There 's signal fires , but where are they ? Where the fuck are the boats ? They 've gone without us , Maddox ! No . They were waiting for them . - [ Jonesy ] What do you mean ? - l was wrong . They were waiting to be rescued , but the boats must have taken too long . [ Jonesy ] Then we need to get out of here . No . The message we intercepted said they leave in two days . That 's tomorrow morning . They 're still coming , Jonesy . [ Jonesy ] We can 't rely on that message . It 's our last fucking chance of hope . Help me stoke the fires . They need to be able to see the shoreline . - Come on ! - [ jet engine roaring overhead ] Help me . [ Jonesy ] We 've gotta get back to the base . Stop fucking filming and help me ! They could be out there now looking for our signal . [ Jonesy ] We 've gotta get back to the bunker , Maddox . And then what ? ! This is our last chance at survival , Jones . [ Jonesy ] Come with me . It 's safer underground . I 'm staying , Jonesy . These boats are coming , believe me . [ Jonesy ] Fuck 's sake , Maddox ! You said it 's safe if we stick together . - Maddox , listen to me ! - Just go then ! Go ! I have to wait here . Please . Hello ! [ muffled breathing ] You shouldn 't have fucking left him ! [ Jonesy ] I had no choice , Leeann . He wouldn 't come back . Here . - Which way to the tunnels ? - That way . Follow me . [ zombies moaning ] [ Nicholson ] Fall back ! Fall back ! [ gunfire ] Fall back ! Fall back ! [ thumping ] lt 's fucking blocked ! We can 't get through ! [ Jonesy ] What we gonna do ? What we gonna do ? ! We fight ! [ grunting , shouting ] - [ yelling ] - [ Jonesy ] Nicholson ! [ Leeann grunting ] [ Jonesy ] Leeann ! Just come on , get back . [ Leeann ] Fuck ! [ grunting ] [ Jonesy ] Oh no ! Leeann ! [ Leeann moaning , screaming ] Jonesy ! This is Nick Jones . I don 't know if anyone 's gonna see this ... lt 's over . For me , it 's over . [ whimpering ] [ zombie growling ] - [ screaming ] - [ gunshot ] [ muffled breathing ] [ helicopter flying overhead ] [ voice echoes ] Leave it , Jonesy . [ waves sloshing ] [ speaks foreign language ] I don 't understand you . We 're in England now , you need speak English . I 'm sorry . She 's scared . We both are . It 's taken us a long time to get here . We came from Holland . Rotterdam . It 's gone . The whole city 's on fire . It seems like all of Europe is . They said to come here ... the UK . It 's an island ... so it 's safe . Right ? [ woman ] They said survivors are gathering here . is it true ? Can you help us ?

 - I 'm going for a week , not until the end of time . - Yeah . Previously on Fringe ... Our Agent Dunham ... Has she made contact ? She 's on the other side focused on the task at hand . Since you got back from the other side , it 's like you 're a completely different person . How 'd you do it ? How 'd you replace our Olivia ? Listen , whatever happens to me , I want you to know that this started out as an assignment , - but it became ... - Something more . That would be so much easier to believe if you weren 't in handcuffs right now . Have you seen Colonel Broyles ? He 's late to work this morning . His wife said that he did not come home last night , and that is ... is very unlike him . Paging Ms. Levin ... your party is waiting for you at terminal 7 , gate 3 . Final boarding for Gotham air flight ... Guess who . Uh ... Well , the voice isn 't familiar , but , uh , the hands I like . They 're kind of ... rugged and sexy . Oh . No , sorry . I ... I ... I don 't recognize you . No , it 's my fault . - I thought you were someone else . - Oh . Well , you should probably leave , because I 'm waiting for my boyfriend , and we haven 't seen each other for a few months , and he 's really big and strong , so ... But , you know , actually , now that I think about it , there is something in your face that 's kind of ringing a bell . Yeah , maybe ... - Maybe it 's my , um , lips . - Hmm . It 's so good to be home . You hungry ? Due to inclement weather over the midwest , the following flights have been canceled ... Glatterflug flight 7 bound for Chicago . Gotham air 3 bound for St. Louis . " Everybody talks about the weather . Nobody does anything about it . " I 'm quoting Samuel Clemens . You stranded too ? In a way , yeah , I , uh ... I 'm waiting on someone who got delayed . Could you pass me the salt , please ? - Sure . - Thank you . Thank you . - How was the shower ? - It was hot . I was beginning to think there wasn 't a hot shower anywhere in North Texas . Well , welcome back to civilization . Well , to what do I owe the honor ? You 're a national hero . I figured you deserve the good stuff . - Cheers . - Cheers . Hmm . It 's good . Liv ... Everything all right ? What do you mean ? I don 't know . It 's just , uh ... Didn 't say a word to me on the drive back from the airport . And when I 'd call from Texas , you seemed a bit distant . Well , we were distant . Yeah , I know . Just you almost ... didn 't seem like yourself . Oh . You know , work 's just been kind of crazy . Look , I know when I 'm away , we can be a bit off . Just want to make sure it 's not something more . No . It 's just everything 's a little overwhelming since Broyles went missing . Do you have any leads ? No . They , uh , found his car at the edge of a no-go zone , but nobody knows why it was in there . Something classified ? Possibly , yeah . Uh , Lincoln 's taking over in his absence . He keeps pressing all the official channels , but we 're not getting any answers . They stopped the search . I 'm sorry I couldn 't be here for you . I know how you feel about him . Well , you 're here now . - And I 'm glad about that . - Me too . Help . Please , help . You have any idea how much I missed watching you get dressed in the morning ? What time is it ? Uh , it 's about 8 : 00 . I thought you might like to sleep in . Yeah . Thank you . Hey , uh ... - You want to get away this weekend ? - Uh , sure . Where ? I don 't know . How about we hop on an airship and go down to Annapolis like we used to ? - Annapolis ? - Yeah . We can go to the crab shack on the wharf or ... - Obrecky 's ? - Right . Remember how great their jukebox was ? I would love that . Dunham . Okay . I 'm on my way . Bye . Hey . I heard they 're rerouting all the flights from Newark ... Bomb scare ? Nope . Spontaneous bug eruption . Guy named Harry Millman , 42 years old ... They found him in the bathroom . Bugs had eaten their way from the inside out . Oh , fabulous . Gosh , I was just here last night picking up Frank . - So , bugs . - Yep . Ugh , you know how I feel about bugs . Not Charlie . Charlie loves bugs . Look lively , people . New boss is here . How is it that when you say " boss , " it sounds like insubordination ? You see , that 's my tone . Maybe that 's why I didn 't get the promotion . Yeah , maybe , or else I 'm better than you . Okay , so they 're pretty , but what are they ? No idea . We 've been through what ... Three different insect databases ? We still can 't find a match . What happened to the other passengers ? We contacted about half of them . Apparently , the bugs don 't live outside the body too long . And if somebody had been infected , we would have heard about it by now . Yeah , maybe . Maybe not . Maybe some kind of mutant insect bit him , laid eggs under his skin ? That 's comforting . Looks like we got a live one . Gotcha . Sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Secretary . I see the piece that Agent Dunham obtained was finally sent over . Yes , and it seems to be functional . We should have it integrated with the machine by week 's end . Good . That 's actually not why I asked you here . The experiments with the chemical we synthesized from the other Olivia 's brain ... It appears there 's been a breakthrough . This subject was given his second dose of the day . 43 minutes later , this happened . - Crossed over ? - No . Danny ? How are you doing this ? I ... I don 't ... Don 't know . I 'm just ... Just thinking it ... And it 's happening . Aah ! Oh , my God ! Danny ! Call Dr. Jackson ! Nine test subjects get an injection and die within thirty minutes . This one develops a telekinetic ability . What 's the difference ? We 'll know more after we dissect his brain , but I have a theory ... Age . This subject was the youngest of the group , which would make sense , given your notion that the human brain is infinitely capable at birth . We simply need younger subjects . - I think that children ... - No . Sir , we may be close . No children . That is not an option . You 'll have to try something else . Drop your file request on the table . I 'm a little busy right now . Uh , Fringe Division . I 'm Agent Olivia Dunham , and this is Agent ... Agent Charlie Foster ... Francis . I 'm Foster ... Mona Foster . We , uh ... We ... We met before ? I treated you for your arachnid infestation . I 'm not surprised you don 't remember me . You were in a lot of pain . So how are the spiders ? Uh , they 're good . They ... They ... Sometimes they just itch a little bit . Maybe you just need someone to scratch it . Hmm . So ... What brings Fringe here today ? It 's order Coleoptera , for sure , Archostemata maybe , but species ? No clue . Where did you find this ? Uh , the Empire Docking Station . That 's kind of an unusual habitat for beetles . They ate their way out of a person . Interesting ... Yeah . Wait here a minute . - Don 't even start with me . - Oh ... - Don 't ... - Bug girl 's got a crush on Charlie . Bug girl has a crush on the fact that I got spiders in my blood , kiddo . Come on , everybody 's looking for someone that 's gonna like them for who they are inside , right ? Are you kidding me right now ? Skelter beetle ... Mansohnium boogliosus , which answers one question but raises a whole bunch of others . - Such as ? - Such as how is this here ? Skelter beetles are parasitic . They lived exclusively in sheep . Sheep . And given that all the sheep died out ten years ago ... The bugs died with them . What was it doing inside of a person ? Specimen number 7 was harvested twelve hours ago after a twenty-minute gestation period . I have extracted the epigastric tissue from the beetle 's abdomen and ... And placed it into the substrate . I am now adding 10 milliliters of the protein complex to catalyze a reaction . If the enzyme is present ... The indicator will turn pink . Come on . Get local P.D. to check the house if she 's not answering her phone . Passenger 23 is clear . Passenger 9 is clear . We 've also fully accounted for zeppelin crew - and ground personnel . - The food for the airship ... It 's supplied by an LFC Food Services . And it checks out clean so far . You 're wasting your time . We 're not dealing with an outbreak . We 've cleared 62.237 % of people who could possibly have been exposed . That 's enough to make a statistical inference . This is not an epidemic . Where do I get one of you ? I bet she drives a beetle . You 're not funny . Listen , if you go on a date with her and you 're late , then at least you know that she won 't bug out . Wow . You 're original . - Hey . - Hey . What are you doing here ? Uh , Lincoln requested a CDC liaison . I said I could help . Hey , Frank , how 's cow country ? Let 's just say I 'm happy to be back . You find anything ? Yep , Mansohnium boogliosus . Skelter beetle . They died out with the sheep in ' 01 . Huh . Never heard of them . Let me look at that . I guess for you two this kind of thing is romantic ? Brings back memories , huh ? - Hoboken ? - Uh-huh . There 's nothing like a little cholera outbreak to bring two people together . I can only imagine what it is you see in a guy like that . Oh , he 's kind of perfect , isn 't he ? No , I am perfect , but he 's a close second . - Right . - Right . So still nothing on how our victim got infected ? - Nope . If you learn anything , you let me know . - Mm-hmm . I 'll be in Broyles ' off ... I 'll be in my office . See , what 's odd is with the sheep they have a symbiotic relationship , but now they 're attacking their host . They 're eating their way out . So they look the same , but they 're not the same . Yeah . Yeah , to put it simply . The question is why . What ... What changed ? Why don 't you just ask ? What 's that ? When you don 't know the answer to something , you ask someone who does . Put out a Fringe Alert to the public . Odds are that someone will recognize this beetle and call in a tip . In fact , statistics suggest you will get at least two calls . I don 't know what they pay you here , but I definitely need you in my life . Uh , do you mind ? Hi . What can I get ya ? A cup of Earl Grey and a piece of , um , cherry pie . Okay . That looks complicated . What is it ? I 'm a scientist . This is my , uh , research , but , uh ... You probably wouldn 't understand . Well , try me . Do you know the name Jonas Salk ? Sure . Who doesn 't ? He cured polio . Have you heard of ... Watson and Crick ? They 're those DNA guys , right ? That 's right , yeah . How about , uh , Dr. Armand Silva ? Armand Silva . No . Don 't know that one . Oh . You will . Attention , citizens ... this is a Fringe Alert . If you have seen or have any information regarding this bug , known as a skelter beetle , please call 711 and speak to Fringe Division . Have you decided ? Yeah . I 'll have what he 's having . Hey . Got a minute ? Can I ask a favor ? Of course . What 's up ? I was hoping if the case wraps up this weekend if Olivia could have a few days . Why ? You two got , uh ... Big plans or something ? Yeah . Yeah , you could say that . Sure . Can you , uh ... keep a secret ? You kidding me ? I have my own , like ... cone of silence when it comes to secrets . What is it ? Ma 'am , nobody 's gonna eat your dog , all right ? Thank you for calling . No , sir , these bugs do not have control of your wife . These people are freaks ! What 's going on in this city ? I 'm gonna get a sandwich . Uh , no , sir , I promise that is not the way they work . Yes , you can feel free to call us if something changes . Okay , thank you . How 's it going ? Um , well ... We have had 200 phone calls , mostly from nut jobs and scared ... Frank 's gonna ask you to marry him . I 'm serious . This weekend ... He just told me . I ... I promised I 'd keep it a secret , but you know me , I can 't ... keep a secret . Hey , I think I got a legitimate call here . - Something up ? - No . - Uh-uh . - Okay . Guy used to work at a biology annex . Guy next door to him used to be an expert on skelter beetles . Go . Go check it out . Great . So ? What are you gonna say ? To Frank ? What ? I can keep a secret . Yeah , that 's it . Ah , I wish I could forget these things . His name was Armand Silva . He was in virology down the hall . Those damn things were always getting out . I 'm a scientist , but I hate bugs . You know what he was doing with them ? I don 't know . We were all working on our own projects . I was harvesting sheep hearts for valve replacement surgeries . So how are they back ? The bugs ? Well , that 's what we 're trying to figure out . Do you know where we can find Dr. Silva ? No . In fact , a few years ago , I heard he tried to kill himself . I didn 't really know him that well , but , uh ... It was like those bugs were his whole life . When the sheep died out , he was a mess . But if he 's not dead , he 's definitely the guy you want to talk to . If anyone will know how those bugs have come back , it 'll be him . Jerry Bissell , aged 42 , worked as a data systems repairman . It says that he ate at the Avenue Road Diner about three hours ago . Hey , I know that place . It 's right around the corner . No luck on Dr. Silva . His last known address is outside of Boston , but nothing in the system on him since the city was ambered back in ' 04 . - No record of his death either . - No . Okay , so that means that he 's still out there somewhere . Hey , look at this ... Right there . These are so much different . They 're so much bigger . I 'm gonna take it to forensics , see what they come up with . Hey , can you send someone to the diner as well ? Maybe somebody saw something . Oh , great . Now I got , like , two bosses ? What 's wrong ? Keep feeling like I 'm missing something ... That Broyles would see something I 'm not . Lincoln , you 're doing fine . Don 't worry . We 'll catch this guy together . Do you want me to give you some time alone ? No . Please don 't . What is it ? You 're lovely . You know that ? You 're sweet . And you 're also avoiding answering my question . It 's ... many things . If you had asked me a week ago , I would have told you that I would sacrifice anything ... To save our world . But in fact , there are lines I simply cannot cross . Does that make me weak ? No . It 's what makes you the most brilliant man I 've ever known . And the fact you beat yourself up over these decisions ... Now , that 's what makes me sure of this strength . I wish I had the same faith . I 'm afraid I 've failed , Reiko . Peter was here , and ... He was here of his own choosing , as he needs to be . And I lost him ... I underestimated his attachments over there . I hadn 't factored in the girl . But now you know about the girl . And you know Peter better . You 'll get him back . How could you be so sure ? Do you trust me ? More than anyone . Well , then ... Trust my perspective on this . I know you , Walter . I 've seen your determination , your will . I don 't have a single doubt in my mind you 'll find an answer . You always do . - Hi . - You 're home . So I called Atlanta . I found out some information on Dr. Silva . CDC had a grant he applied for on file , back in ' 97 . Claims he was close to a vaccine for the avian flu . Gosh , if that 's true ... I know . It would have saved millions . Thing is his research ... It reads a little off the wall . Here , take a look at this . The vaccine was based on an enzyme that the skelter beetle produced . And that got me thinking . You think he 's trying to bring the skelter beetle back from extinction ? Is that even possible ? Possible , yeah . Certainly not easy . He 'd have to clone DNA from a preserved specimen . But the real problem would be that the eggs would never hatch . - Because they only live in sheep . - Exactly . He 'd have to modify them . He 'd have to re-engineer them - to live in a different host . - Like people . Sheep and humans share 96 % of the same DNA . And that could account for the reason why the bugs are killing their human hosts . But I just called the lab . They said the bugs they got from the first victim ... They weren 't mature enough to create the enzyme . But the bugs got bigger with the second victim . - They did ? - Yeah . Maybe he is modifying his work . Okay , so say you 're right . - What would he need ? - Like equipment ? Yeah . Call Lincoln . - Retro-viral samples . - Retro-viral samples . - Plasmid array . - Plasmid array . - Liquid spectrometer . - Okay , wait , wait . - Slow down . - An electron microscope and also liquid nitrogen ... You got all that ? All right , I 'm leaving now , so I should be there in about twenty minutes . Uh , Lincoln said that if you were here , he would kiss you . Well , I 'm glad he 's not here . Okay . And you will keep the list on you . - Yes , of course , of course . Keys . - Keys . Yes . Thank you . And my I.D. - And you forgot this . - Oh . I was gonna wait till this weekend . I know we have a lot to figure out . There 's your job , and there 's my job , and there 's my mother . Look , being away from you made me realize how much I can 't stand being away from you . Olivia Dunham ... Will you marry me ? Yes . Seriously ? Hello ? Hey . Where are you ? It 's Lincoln . I 'm just leaving the house . What 's up ? Don 't come down here . We got a hit . Six months ago , Silva purchased a plasmid array . He had it shipped to a warehouse in Brooklyn . I 'm sending you the address now . Silva 's unit is number 21 . I already walked the perimeter . No sign of any other cars . What ? I said yes . Frank asked me , and I said yes . And ? You happy ? Yeah . I am . Good . Then I am too . Watch your step . Thank you . Hey ... I think someone 's here . Hey ! Olivia ! Olivia ! Damn it ! No signal . Please try again . Aah ! Where 's Lincoln ? Come on , there 's got to be something . There 's got to be ... Yes ! There are more agents on their way here now . I think we both know that 's not true . Come on , do yourself a favor and just let me go . They 'll thank me . The whole world ... will thank me . Thank you for what ... Your vaccine ? Is that what you 're talking about ... Your vaccine ? For someone who wants to save lives , you sure don 't have much of a problem killing people . How many did Salk sacrifice trying to get his answers ... Pasteur ... In the name of science ? When the sheep died out , I tried cows , goats , primates . None of them could host the beetles . Humans were my only option . What about stopping the research ? - That wasn 't an option ? - No . Because I was too close . And now ... Now I 'm ... My work is ... is nearly complete . Did you ever ask yourself what you 're leaving behind ? I have an ability . I was on a path . I had a calling , and the world changed on me . It simply ... changed and robbed me of my legacy . This ... world , this decaying madness ... Robbed me . Come on . This is Agent Lee . I need a tactical unit immediately at my location . See , the second batch of specimen were almost mature enough , but not quite . And then I realized ... A queen can hatch her own eggs . She can create a legion , enough for my vaccine . One more human host ... to bring the queen beetle to term . But it 's over now , 'cause we know who you are . You don 't understand . The gestation has already begun . What did you give me ? What the hell did you give me ? Don 't move ! Lincoln . - Lincoln , don 't shoot him . - That 's up to him . No . We need his help . I 've been infected . Don 't worry , Liv . I 'm gonna take care of you . Down ! Now ! Down ! - Olivia ! - Frank ! Oh , Frank , Frank . He dosed her . Oh , Frank , he made me drink the water . Somebody bag that glass ! What do we do ... to stop the infestation ? What do we do to stop it ? - Get her to the hospital . - Let me go ! Get her to the hospital . You 're running out of time . Go . Go ! She 's been infected with a deadly parasite . The next ten minutes are critical . In my kit , there 's a vial of metrifonate . It 's an anti-parasitic . - Liv . - Yeah . I 'm gonna do everything I can . Just hold on . Everybody out ... Now ! Tell me how to save her . Oh ... You have one more chance . Tell me ! If you want your friend to live , put down the gun and do exactly as I say . Aah ! What do you want ? Bring me those panels over there ... And I 'll tell you how to save your friend . B.P. ' S 140 over 90 . Heart rate 's elevated . That could just be the adrenaline . Oh , Frank , my stomach ... The anti-parasitic that I 'm going to give you is powerful . It 's gonna kill the bugs inside you before they hatch . Why do I sense that there 's a " but " coming ? Because it 's a lot for your system to take . Uh-huh . So what do we do ? I don 't think we have a choice . Hand me the wand . Can you zoom in ? What do you see , Frank ? I see movement ! Where ? What the hell am I putting together here ? You 'll work faster if you don 't talk . I gave you what you wanted . Now you tell me how to save her . She doesn 't need saving . I didn 't infect her . - Uh-uh . She was sick . - Not because of me . She 's not the final host . Aah ! Oh ! Syringe is ready . - Look at me . It 's gonna be okay . - Okay . - Stop ! - What ? Take a look at this . What is it ? What is it ? Are you sure ? Look at the beta HCG levels in her blood . - The picture on the sonogram ... - Uh-huh ? You 're not infected . You 're pregnant . I 've done it . The queen is ready . Uhh ... Aah ! Come here . Make sure ... They ... Spell my name ... right . - Can I come in ? - Of course . What did the doctor say ? That the baby 's healthy and that the , uh ... The fall and the adrenaline triggered some kind of morning sickness . How far along are you ? Frank ... Liv , how long you been pregnant ? Six weeks . Are you in love with him ... The father ? That 's all I needed to know . Frank . You ... were gonna marry me . Hello ? Mr. Secretary , there 's been a development . I think I might have another way to bring Peter back from the other universe . Sir . Forgive my intrusion . I hope this isn 't a bad time . Please come in . I heard the news about your pregnancy . Don 't worry . Your position with Fringe Division will remain intact . You 'll have whatever resources you need . After all , you are the mother of my future grandchild .

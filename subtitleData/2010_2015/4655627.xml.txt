 Why are they hanging ? They are suspended by painlessly inserted rods . The suspension allows us to tilt and rotate the body to prevent blood pooling . I know it may be shocking at first , but our methods have been approved by the AMA , the CDC and the World Health Organization . They are covered by artificial skin that protects them from infection and injury . They 're more comfortable than they would be in a standard hospital setting . If there 's the least possibility of rousing , then ... the computers will notify us . You see , they 're not really alive . But they 're not dead , either . Someone has to take care of them . It 's empty now , ma 'am . Oh , thank you , dear . There . Will I be allowed to leave now ? What else would we do with you ? - Hey . - Hi . What are you doing here so late ? Another coma . At least we didn 't cause this one . What happened ? Guy tried to off himself in a running car locked in his garage . Guess it was taking too long , so he cut his wrist with a hacksaw . Sliced right through the tendon . Good chance he 'll lose the hand , but he 'll never know . By they time they found him , he was brain-dead from the exhaust . Why is the blood so bright ? Oh , if I had to guess , I 'd say it 's from the carbon monoxide . Dr. Ramirez ? Hey . Can I ask you one more question about Nancy Greenly ? I don 't think so . Just which operating room was she in ? - The file says O.R. 3 . - Then that 's what it was . No , wait . Uh-uh , three 's on the left . No , it was one of the rooms on the right . - Could it have been O.R. 8 ? - Maybe . I don 't know . It just wasn 't three . When my study is complete , I believe we will finally be in a position for live testing . Oh , sounds like Nobel territory . I just want to kill dementia . I 'm looking for keen minds who can help me take this project to the next level once the data comes in . Unless , of course , you 've chosen a different specialty . I 'm all yours . All yours . You 've reached Susan Wheeler . Sorry I missed you . Leave a message , and I 'll call you back . Thanks . Susan , hey . It 's Mark . Uh , I just got in , and I am just wondering how the Jefferson tour went , so give me a call when you get a second . Liza . Hi . What are you doing ? - Come inside . - No , I ... I can 't . Donna 's in the car . Are you okay ? What 's wrong ? I didn 't want to leave without seeing you . I 'm driving down to Sarasota to stay with friends . In the middle of the night ? Why ? My mother won 't talk about it , but they came to the house after he died . They took all of his papers , all of his financial records ... - Whoa , whoa . Who came to the house ? - I don 't know . - Did you call the police ? - My mother wouldn 't let me . - Liza , what the hell is going on ? - I don 't know what 's happening , but I know what happened to my dad . Stay out of it , Mark . He loved you . Okay . Excuse me , miss ? You 're ... you 're bleeding . - Oh . - Can I help you with it ? No . I ... I didn 't even feel it . Um , thanks . You okay , miss ? Hi . Yeah , I 'm fine . I just ... cut myself on the way down the stairs . I 'm leaving now . Thanks . Yeah , I ... Let me call you back . We never see each other anymore . What 's the occasion ? It 's a courtesy call , actually . I didn 't want you to hear this from anybody else . I 'm taking a leave of absence from teaching , actually . But you love teaching . That 's what you are . Yeah . It 's what makes me immortal . Ah . Oh , dear . Well , these numbers aren 't so good , are they ? But I suppose , if anyone can beat them , you can . I see the lab work was done at Macon . Should I be insulted ? No . Forrester 's an old , old friend of mine , and it 's only an hour and a half away . But you will have the surgery here . Justin is the best oncologist . The best . Forrester is doing the surgery . I know what 's going on , Sam . I 'm feeling it , too . I mean , we started with her grandfather . With her grandfather . It 's been that long , not that either of us needs to be reminded how old we 're getting . She is like him , isn 't she ? Oh , boy . I see him every time I ... I look into her eyes in class . Anything you need . Anything . In less than six months , the 607-CLW therapy has completely altered the gene array in three of the twelve pre-Alzheimer 's patients . Well ... Ahem ... That 's encouraging . But Dr. Stark 's work with the Friedrick-Kane bioengineered heart is getting even better data . You know , it 's tough selling prevention over cure . Stark 's going to fight you on this . I need one more subject to begin the trial of the 608 . If I begin within the week , we can publish the results simultaneously . I thought you already had a full complement of test subjects . One subject , a female , proved unviable . She was , uh , pregnant and was moved to another study . It 's not going to happen . It has to . We are so close . One more ? You know it would require the full committee 's approval to add another subject to your study , and Stark 's backing the heart . We 're talking about preventing thousands of cases of Alzheimer 's in screened subjects . This is the breakthrough that we 've been looking for . It 's absolutely an emergency . I heard you were all up here . - Sorry , sir . - Uh , it 's all right . Boy , someone searched my car , and now this . This must be some presentation . What are you doing ? Who put pills in my car ? - Pills ? - Yes , pills . I 'm sorry , doctor . I have to ask you to leave . The ethics board , of which you are not a member , has serious ... I 'm sorry , but what kind of ethical bombshell demands a guard at the door ? He 's your candidate . This is neither the time nor the place . Uh-huh . We have to protect our intellectual property . Afraid of another Dr. Taylor incident ? Is that it ? Maybe we should put a guard - at all the doctors ' houses . - Mark , you are out of line . Dr. Bellows , I 'm sure your students need you . Where is Stark anyway ? Pull ! Hell of a shot . - Now I need to hit one . - It 's simple , Bill . You just got to know where your target 's going to be before he gets there . It 's like medicine . Pull ! If you know where medicine 's going to be in five years , say , well , then , the rewards would just be there for the taking , wouldn 't they ? We 're just a little skittish about when we 'll see a return . We haven 't seen much from the Alzheimer 's project . We 're putting Alzheimer 's on the back burner , because I 'm advancing a new study ... the bio-hybrid heart . The genetic test markers on this thing are astonishing . It 's going to be a billion dollar business right out of the ... Heart disease is where the money is . Yeah . Right out of the gate . Pull ! Okay . Oh , my God . Mark , it 's me . I really need to see you , so can you meet me at the university library after your shift ? Ramona , I need the department heads in an hour . Oh , and conference in London . It 's evening in London , sir . Just get them for me , please . Oh , and I need , um , uh ... what 's his name ... - Chad Morgan at NIH . - Right away , Dr. Stark . Thank you . I 'll wait . Mr. Morgan 's wife says he 's out . She 's not sure when he 'll be back . He won 't pick up at dinner , sir . What the hell ? Dr. Stark , do you want to call him later ? Dr. Stark , can you hear me ? Should I leave word ? Ramona , call 911 ! Dr. Stark ? I need ... I need help ! - Dr. Stark , what 's wrong ? - I need help right now ! Ramona ! Have you been in an accident ? Dr. Stark , what 's wrong ? Oh ! Oh ! Help ! Uh , Detective Jackson , please . Okay , tell him it 's Susan Wheeler . Yeah . Well , I just found a camera hidden in a light in my kitchen . Yeah , there 's a camera hidden in my kitchen , and it means I 'm being watched , so can I speak to him or not ? Well , he 's a fighter , I 'll give him that . Ah . I 'm not about to tell you how to run things , but events like this just call attention to bigger problems . Well , it couldn 't have happened at a more inopportune time . There were no witnesses , but everything points to an accident . Well , our first concern is with Dr. Stark . - Of course . - My second question is about personal effects . Files , charts that might have been left in his car . We did a complete search of the vehicle . Nothing . But assuming he pulls through ... He might want his phone back . I 'll take care of it . We got a call from Susan Wheeler . Oh , yeah , the attacker with the burlap bag . She says she found hidden cameras in her apartment , but she hung up before we could get anything else . So , what do you want to do ? After what she said happened in the park , we 're going to take a look . Okay . Hey , have you guys seen Susan ? Probably busy brown-nosing Bellows . She 's a Wheeler , remember ? He should be sucking up to her . Hey , Paul , - why 'd you choose medicine ? - I didn 't . Medicine chose me . Oh , well , how fortunate for you and medicine I think so , too . No , my mom 's a psychiatrist . Step-dad owns the largest surgical supply business in the southeast , and my dad delivered pretty much half the babies in Polk County . It 's in the blood , Fairweather . I guess it 's in my blood , too . My mother 's a hypochondriac , and my father makes me sick . What about you , Hanna ? Liked playing doctor so much , you figured you 'd get paid for it ? Oh , wow , that 's really ... That 's really funny , Geoffrey , in a verging-on-sexual-harassment sort of way . No , I actually ... I want to help people . And I want a big house . So , why don 't you give Susan a break ? I mean , she wants to heal the sick . You can 't blame her for her pedigree . I doubt she wants a big house in Buckhead , but otherwise , she 's just like the rest of us . - Geez . - Geez . Dude , we 're eating here . All right , listen up . They chose us for a reason ... we 're the best students here . Now , each year , they choose one student to fast-track for residency . Now , do we we sit back and let it be her , or should it be one of us ? What are you proposing ? - Did you hear a proposal ? - Look ... If she makes a mistake , let 's not keep it a secret . Yeah , like the hypodermic angst . Yeah . Uh , or ... I have a novel idea . What don 't y 'all work harder and get noticed that way ? Did you hear about Stark ? No . What happened ? He had a car accident . He went off an overpass . Is he okay ? I 've heard three different things about his condition . I don 't know what to believe . He 's at Mercy now . They 're going to transfer him here this afternoon . Well , was it an accident , or was he trying to kill himself , too ? Mark , you have got to let this thing about Taylor drop . And what were you saying about pills ? What pills ? Somebody planted pills in my car . Okay , I don 't know what 's going on with you , but if you really cared about Taylor and his work and what he left behind , you 'll stop causing trouble . Causing trouble ? What does that even mean ? It means that I 'm trying to preserve his legacy . Well , maybe Memorial 's not the place for me after all . Susan is what 's keeping you from realizing your full potential . Okay . Do you really think things are different at any other hospital ? Hi . I just need to make sure my name 's off the locker list . - It 's 825 . Thanks . - Sure . Excuse me . Dr. Taylor , he 's not 829 . He 's just two down from me . Probably changed it without telling us . Susan , I got here as soon as I could . - I found cameras in my apartment . - They 're watching you ? I called the police , but we 'll see if they do anything . Look , there 's a company ... Called Helix Global Care , Inc . Now , they own Jefferson . They 're making payments to the doctors and the families of all these coma patients . There 's some sort of brokerage account . Look at all these transactions . Hey , in all ten coma cases , the procedures were done in O.R. 8 . Of course , they changed all the records so that no one would notice the pattern . I followed a gas line from O.R. 8 down to the basement . It wasn 't attached to any tank . All the blood in the patients was bright red . - Carbon monoxide ? - After they 've chosen a patient , they must move in the tank . Then they control it remotely , and not even the doctor or surgeon or anesthesiologists would have any idea . You 're saying that they 're choosing the patients ? They pick them from genetic markers based on pre-surgery blood tests , so I 'm just trying to figure out why . Okay , well , think about it . The human body is the ultimate laboratory , right ? Its functions are interrelated and impossible to duplicate . I think they 're performing tests on people who are predisposed to certain diseases . - Yeah . - We got to go to the police . Wait . If we sound an alarm too soon , they can just destroy everything . I mean , I think we should gather all the evidence we can . Is there any paperwork , any hard copies that the hospital keeps ? Anything with , like , a signature ? Yes . Yes , the ... the blood work . - Most of it goes to outside labs . - Great . - Here 's a list of the case numbers . - Okay . - Can you go to hematology ? - I 'll go right now . - I 'm going to go to the biology lab . - Okay . Meet back at my place , yeah ? Okay . What 's at the biology lab ? I recognized some of the sequences from the genetic research they do there . What do you mean , you recognized the sequences ? This is research my grandfather started . - I 'll see you soon . - Okay . Thanks . How 's the leg ? Oh , it 's ... it 's better . Thanks . Ah , got you working on Saturdays , too , huh ? Well , the place is all yours . - Thanks . - Thank you . Sir , can I help you ? Oh , I 'm meeting the young lady who just went up to the fifth floor . - She 's expecting me . - Well , that 's a Memorial I.D. , - and it doesn 't work here . - I 'll only be a second . Let 's start by you stepping out and showing me your I.D. - Mark , what are you doing here ? - I , uh , got some ... It 's a long story . You can 't be here . Are you in trouble ? Did you really push yourself into a meeting upstairs ? Trying to get yourself fired ? I ... it seems I am . Maybe you 're not worried about your job , but I 'm keeping mine . Fiona , come on . Please , do we have to do this now ? Why don 't you ask Agnetta ? Maybe she can help you out . I 'm begging you . Please ? Please ? These are archived lab orders , Mark ... it 's not life or death . Actually , it is . - Five minutes . - You 're the best . Thank you . Susan ... Are you in there , Susan ? Susan ... Susan ... Ms. Wheeler ? It 's Detective Jackson . You called earlier . Hello ? Hello ! All clear in here . I spy . Sir ? Sir ? You okay ? Help ! Help ! Help ... Susan . Don 't be afraid . Susan ... Here I come , ready or not . Susan . Susan ? Hello ? Susan , can you hear me ? Susan ? Mark ! Hey , I was looking for you . We need you in surgery now . It 's an emergency . I 'm sorry . I can 't do it . - You ... you can 't ? Can 't what ? - Get ... get Cortez ! You 've reached Susan Wheeler . Sorry I missed ... Susan ! - Who are you ? - Who are you ? All right , Susan told me to meet her here . I heard a terrible noise on the other end of the phone ... - A noise , huh ? - Was there a struggle here ? - How ... how should I know ? - Looks like there might have been a struggle here . - Is that her blood ? - Why do you think it 's blood ? That 's blood . I 'm Dr. Mark Bellows , so ... What is the nature of your relationship with Ms. Wheeler ? She is a student and ... and a colleague of mine - over at Memorial Hospital . - Are you doing her ? I ... well , that 's none of your business . Listen , I don 't think we have time for this , okay ? Susan has stumbled on some kind of situation ... - What kind of situation ? - I don 't know , but I think she 's in danger , and I need to find her , so , please , I 'll explain everything , but we have to find her . She 's at the uni ... I think you should come with us . Son of a ... Hold it , doc ! Freeze ! Freeze ! I 'm sorry . Look , I ... I wasn 't running , okay ? - I ... I have no reason to run . - And I 'm not chasing you . We need to make sure she 's ... Anyplace but Memorial . Please don 't take me to Memorial . Susan ... Susan ... I 'm very patient . I like waiting . Some people don 't mind waiting , but ... I like it . Ginnie Newberger had blonde hair , blonder than yours . And curls down her back that ended just at her bra strap . Susan ... I know you 're here . I can smell you . Ginnie wore a white blouse , with different colored skirts ! Can you hear me , class ? Ginnie ... 400 dreams . She kept them in a journal . Nighttime dreams , with dates and times . She carried it around with her so her parents wouldn 't find it . And she wouldn 't even let anyone look at it . I wanted it . 'Cause I wanted to see if any of her 400 dreams were the same as mine . So I waited . I watched her back . I watched her bra . 'Cause I knew it was just a matter of time . One day , I put a bag on her head and I smashed it ... With a stone they used to mark the edge of the trail . I had the rest of the day to sit there and read the journal before they found me . And you know what ? Her dreams weren 't all that different than mine . They were even a little bit dull . All these years later , I remember more about her crisp white blouses than a single one of her dreams . You know what 's disgusting ? Someone donates their body to medical school and thinks they 're helping to cure cancer ... And ends up like this . It 's disrespect . It 's disrespect . It 's disrespect ! I know you 're here , Susan . I can feel you . Dr. Bellows . Where 's Susan Wheeler ? Is she okay ? - She 's ... gathering evidence . - What evidence ? The comas at the ... We were supposed to meet at her place . Tell her I 'm okay , please . Make sure she gets this . I will . Captain ! Commissioner got a call from the Wheeler family . They haven 't been able to get in touch with her . Asked me to follow up . Susan ! Susan ... ! I 'm not comfortable with it . I thought we agreed adding another subject was unwise . The genetic markers fit the protocol . I don 't like it . I don 't like it , either . But it solves a lot of our other problems . I 'm freezing . Freezing . Please . It 's a dream . It 's a dream . It 's a dream . Please don 't put me under . Surgery 's over , Dr. Bellows . You did fine . They had to put three screws in your ankle , but the bone in your leg should heal up nicely . You 'll be in a boot for about a month or so . Where am I ? Mercy . You 're at Mercy . Mercy ? Mercy . Hello ? You 've reached Dr. Mark Bellows . I can 't take your call right now . Please leave a message after the beep . Mark , it 's me . Where are you ? Look , I lost my cell phone , and , uh , I 'm home now . But I don 't know that I should stay here . Um ... Look , I 'm going to go ... I 'm going to go to the place where you saved me . I know you know where I mean . Just be careful , okay ? Susan , right ? Thank God . We 've been looking for you . It 's okay . I saw Mark a little while ago . Mark ? Where is he ? He was in an accident , broke his leg . - What ? - They 're taking good care of him . He was very worried about you . He gave this to me for you . He said you 'd know what to do with it . Do you know what it is ? Yeah . This is proof that Memorial is targeting patients for comas . Really ? Marie made the cheerleading squad . She wore your school ring on a chain around her neck . You made her feel like ... So , this job is great , but it 's in Stanford . And , uh , I 'm gonna be moving . Visiting hours have ended for this evening . We look forward to seeing you again soon . - No . No ! - Let 's go . Let 's go , let 's go . There we go . Hello , Susan . Who found him ? His replacement found him . Surveillance footage was wiped clean . Bellows tried to tell us where she was going . We 've got another one . Up here . Detective , got something else . Find somebody to turn that damn thing off . Something tells me that belongs to Susan Wheeler . Detective . Anything on here about comas ? No . It looks like genetic code , maybe . We 've got something else . All right , hold on to that . True you had a runner hit by a car while you were talking to him ? Yeah . Apparently , I needed the exercise . Through there . This place gives me the creeps . Oh , boy . Is this going to take much longer ? I have a memorial to attend . Arno 's first arrest was as a minor in Portland . You know I can 't talk about that ... patient confidentiality . Yeah . Well , the file says that he kidnapped a young woman in the woods , put a burlap bag over her head and bashed her brains in . I 'd say that qualifies him as violent . Yet you made a recommendation for release . And then , after he was released , you helped him secure a job as an electrician at Memorial . He was the perfect patient . He responded very well to an anti-psychotic drug trial . The treatment was augmented by intensive daily psychotherapy . When you continued to see him as a patient , did you ever have any ... concerns about his mental state ? I have concerns about all my patients . - Any special concerns ? - No . You know Susan Wheeler ? She 's a medical student at Memorial . You really expect me to believe you don 't know who she is ? Students come , students go . Oh , geez . What 's going on in here ? I just need you to help me get this catheter out . Sir , you can 't be pulling this stuff off . Sir , you are heavily medicated . Listen , I need you to get my phone and an air cast , please . There 's no one here that can discharge you . Okay , I 'm a doctor . I 'm going AMA . I can discharge myself , thank you . Dr. Bellows . A little soon for you to be up and around , isn 't it ? Hi . Did you guys find Susan yet ? Not yet . What do you mean , " not yet " ? I told the other cop where to find her . - You did ? - Yes , at her apartment . She was gathering evidence . I gave him the blood panels . I 'll send a car to Wheeler 's apartment . No , no , don 't do that . She left me a message . We should go to the university pool . Do you know a Dr. Agnetta Lindquist ? I do . She 's head of psychiatry at Memorial . How about a fellow named Peter Arno ? - No . Why ? - He was her patient . He just cut his throat in the Lindbergh anatomy lab . Oh , no , no , no , no , no . Don 't do that . That 's what 's going to keep you nice and comfortable . The hospital 's putting healthy people into comas because they fit a study . You see , this is why I think that the back of the hand is a bad idea . I actually prefer the scalp , like the neonatals do it . You 're testing them . Do they ... do they know ? Do the families know ? When I got back from my honeymoon , my sister 's little girl , Theresa , got very sick . They took her to the hospital and found out she had spinal meningitis . Pediatrician said we were going to lose her before morning . I made a promise to God that if he would spare my little girl 's life ... my niece 's , Theresa ... that I would never ask for anything for myself again , not ever . That night , Theresa 's fever broke . And when a year , two years , three years passed and ... it turned out that I ... couldn 't conceive , bear a child of my own ... I never complained . Never once . Because that was the promise I 'd made with God . Now I have all the babies I want . Right here . Hey , any luck ? Nothing in either locker room . She wasn 't on the surveillance footage . We 'll leave some men here in case she shows up . But any other idea where she might be ? No . I 'm still waiting to hear from the captain . We 're going to go check out Peter Arno 's place . How is that going to help us find Susan ? He was following her . We might find something . I ... I 'm coming with you . You know , I 'm not a doctor , but you might want to stay off that foot . Oh , you think ? Thanks . Yeah . How long ago did he move in ? Six months or so . Any trouble ? Same as all the rest . I got three apartments I rent out . $ 80 a week , share the bathroom . - No pets , nothing kinky . - Oh , that 's good to know . He ever say anything about this woman ? He never said anything about anything . " You 'll end up in Jefferson , too . " That 's what he said to her . No ... No , what are you doing ? Those numbers are too high . You 're going to kill me . No , no . We 'll take good care of you . Shh . Just relax . Soon , you 'll be floating . Floating away . You won 't be dead . 'Course , you won 't be alive . That 's right . Yeah . Uh , no . I think I 'll use the eights . Those tens might shatter her pelvis . She 's quite petite . Susan ! Maguire . Yes , ma 'am ? Find miss Wheeler . She 's up and about . Although she 's definitely under the influence . And tell Talbot to check the security footage . I want to know who entered the prep room . - May I help you ? - Atlanta PD , ma 'am . Have you seen this woman ? Oh , uh , Susan Wheeler . She did a tour here with us recently . Why , is she in any trouble ? - So , she wasn 't here today ? - No . Mind if we come in ? Yes . Yes , we can , or yes , you mind ? Well , there 's no admittance to the facility after 7 : 00 P.M. I 'm sorry , but I 'm under a strict mandate by our legal department . Susan ... Susan . Help us . Susan ... Susan . Help us . Susan ! Susan . Help me , Susan . Help ... Hey , you , get out of there ! You 're not authorized to be down there ! We 'd just like to talk to your staff . I am the staff . You 're not the whole staff . Oh ... Code yellow , area one . Code yellow , area one . What 's area one ? Oh , it 's one of our holding areas . My babies . My babies . Oh ... Hey . Um , ma 'am , ma 'am , please . Young man , we house severely ill patients here . We have to keep any possible contamination to a minimum . I 'm sure you can understand that . I do , I understand . But I 'm a doctor . Well , you 're not a doctor here . I 'm a doctor everywhere . I do not have the authority to admit you . I 'm sorry . I will be glad to answer your questions , - but unless you return ... - Ma 'am ? With a court order , - I cannot let you enter . - Please , ma 'am , you don 't ... You don 't understand . Please ! This is an emergency . Please ! Oh ... oh , good . - Okay , yeah . Yeah . - We got to get in there . - What if Susan 's inside ? - We found the captain . He 's at Stark 's . No ! No ! Please ! Let me ... We were looking all over for you . You can 't be part of this . Part of it ? This is my invention . Mine and your grandfather 's . The idea for this was born in conversations that we started thirty years ago . I 'm not naive enough to think that you 'll be able to understand what I 'm about to say is a compliment , but ... This is all yours . - This is your legacy . - No . This will never be my legacy . You know that 200 years ago , surgeons had to sneak into graveyards and steal bodies for dissection . These specimens are an enormous advance of knowledge . We have bioengineering . We have stem cells from umbilical cords . Ugh ! Nobody understands the costs until they see benefits . Benefits ? This is human sacrifice . That 's exactly the right word . " Sacrifice . " What are you doing here ? When these specimens cease to be viable , they 're harvested for their tissue and their vital organs and their corneas and their ... skin ... They continue to be a utility to man ... Do you think that makes it right ? ! I will not apologize to you for what I 've been doing . You don 't have the life experience to come to the conclusions that I have come to , to come to the conclusions that your grandfather came to . When you have spent your life arguing with bureaucrats and begging on your knees for the last five dollars of the grant , then you can tell me that we should go back and just fix broken bones and ... and ... and tap the fatally ill on the head . Or you can say we can continue . I 'm Detective Jackson , Atlanta PD . Excuse me . Susan Wheeler . Do you know where she is ? Have you seen her ? Dr. Bellows . Please , I mean , have you ... not heard Dr. Stark passed away during surgery - this afternoon ? - What ? We 're here to honor his memory . What 's the meaning of this , Jackson ? Look , I ... I 'm sorry , sir . Susan Wheeler was attacked at the university today , and now she 's gone missing . - She 's not here . - Wait a second . You told me that you were going to look for her . After I saw you , I went to Miss Wheeler 's apartment to look for her , and she didn 't show . I came here directly after I heard that Dr. Stark had passed away during surgery . Now , I have two men watching her place right now . You 've wasted enough time here , Jackson , and you 're testing the patience of Dr. Stark 's colleagues who have come here to honor his memory . Yes , sir . " Yes , sir " ? That 's it ? Hey , wait a second . We 're still looking . Hopefully , she 's found a safe place where she can stay out of sight . Detective ! I know where she is . She 's at Jefferson . You murdered Sean Berman , Nancy Greenly ... they were people I knew , with lives and people who loved them . I confess that I keep such knowledge at bay so that I can keep a steady hand , but ... The herd must be culled ... And we must perfect mankind . Did you know that in this building right now , there is a cure for Alzheimer 's and lupus ? Does that make any difference ? And we will cure cancer and the common cold and everything else . And it 's taken us thousands of years to get here . It would have taken thousands more if your grandfather and I had not come to this decision . Does that mean anything to you ? You are sick . No ! No ! Stop her ! Susan ... Susan ! All right , now , everybody , just split up . Make sure we cover all the floors . Ugh ! Ugh ! Cuff him . Where is she ? You have the right to remain silent . Anything you say can and will be used - against you in a court of law . - Where 's Susan ? You have the right to have an attorney - present during questioning . - Oh , God . If you cannot afford one , one will be provided to you at government expense . You understand these rights as I 've read them to you ? Help me ! Susan ! Susan ! No ... Help . No ! No ! No ! No ! Susan ! Susan ? Susan . Oh , my God . Mark . Mark . Hi . Hi . You 're here . I had a terrible dream . I dreamt I was underwater . I didn 't think I could ever get out . Well , you 're okay now . You 're safe . It was just a dream . It was just a dream .

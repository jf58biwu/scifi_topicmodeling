 RALEIGH : When I was a kid , Whenever I 'd feel small or lonely , I 'd look up at the stars . Wondered if there was life up there . Turns out I was looking in the wrong direction . [ ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ] When alien life entered our world It was from deep beneath the pacific ocean . A fissure between two tectonic plates . A portal between dimensions . The breach . I was fifteen when the first Kaiju Made land in san Francisco . [ KAIJU ROARING ] [ RADIO CHATTER ] [ KAIJU GROANS ] By the time tanks , jets and missiles took it down Six days and 35 miles later , three cities were destroyed . Tens of thousands of lives were lost . [ ALARM BLARING ] [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] We mourned our dead , memorialized the attack , And moved on . [ KAIJU ROARS ] [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] [ ALARM RINGING ] And then , only six months later , The second attack hit manila . FEMALE NEWSCASTER : The acid factor of the Kaiju blood Creates a toxic phenomenon named Kaiju blue . RALEIGH : And then the third one hit Cabo . And then the fourth . And then we learned this was not gonna stop . This was just the beginning . [ KAIJU ROARS ] We needed a new weapon . The world came together , pooling its resources And throwing aside old rivalries For the sake of the greater good . To fight monsters , we created monsters of our own . The Jaeger program was born . There were setbacks at first . The neural load to interface with a Jaeger Proved too much for a single pilot . A two-Pilot system was implemented . Left-Hemisphere , right-Hemisphere pilot control . We started winning . Jaegers stopping Kaijus everywhere . But the jaegers were only as good as their pilots . So Jaeger pilots turned into rock stars . Danger turned into propaganda . Kaijus into toys . We got really good at it . Winning . [ HORNS HONKING ] Then ... then it all changed . [ RAPID BEEPING ] GIPSY DANGER AI : Gipsy danger , report to bay 08 , level a-42 . Kaiju . Code name : Knifehead . Category 3 . Yo , Yancy , wake up ! Movement in the breach . Hey , come on ! We 're being deployed . Great . Good morning . Mornin ' . Kaiju 's a category 3 ...

[ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Come on , beckets . Time for the drop . Hey , kid . Yeah ? Don 't get cocky . RALEIGH : Years before , You wouldn 't have picked my brother Yancy and I for heroes . No chance . MAN : Good morning , sir . All right , let 's suit up and kick some ass ! RALEIGH : We were never star athletes . Never at the head of the class . But we could hold our own in a fight . And it turned out we had a unique skill : We were drift compatible . [ MOTORS WHIRRING ] All right . Data on helmet . Data relay gel dispersing in circuitry suit . TENDO CHOI : Good morning , Becket boys ! Tendo , what 's happening , my man ? How 'd that date with Alison go last night , Mr. Choi ? Oh , she loved me . Her boyfriend ? Not so much . You 're gonna get your ass kicked . [ CHUCKLES ] A man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do , brother . Engage drop , Mr. Choi . [ CLEARS THROAT ] engaging drop , sir . Marshal Pentecost on deck .

YANCY : Right hemisphere is calibrating . Left hemisphere calibrating . Proofed and transmitting . PENTECOST : Gentlemen , your orders are To hold the miracle mile off anchorage . Copy ? Copy that , sir . Sir , there 's still a civilian vessel in the gulf ... Gentlemen , you 're protecting a city of 2 million people . You will not risk those lives for a boat that holds 10 . Am I clear ? Yes , sir . Man , that 's cold . You know what I 'm thinking . I 'm in your brain . I know . Then let 's go fishing . Here we go ! Come on , bro ! Put some muscle to it ! Worry about yourself , kiddo ! RALEIGH : There are things you can 't fight , acts of god . You see a hurricane coming , you have to get out of the way . But when you 're in a Jaeger , Suddenly , you can fight the hurricane . You can win . [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] MERRITT : Get ' em tied down and go down below ! Now ! How far to the mainland ? 7 miles off anchorage , sir . But we won 't even make it past the shallows ! No , we won 't ! What about that island 3 miles east ? [ BEEPING ] No ! No ! It 's 2 miles , sir . O-One mile , sir ! It 's getting closer . How the hell can it be getting closer ? [ RAPID BEEPING ] Kaiju . Harder starboard ! I 'm doing it as fast as I can ! Now !

Job 's done , sir . Lit it up twice . Bagged our fifth kill . You disobeyed a direct order ! Respectfully , sir , We intercepted a Kaiju and saved everyone on that boat . Get back to your post , now ! Yes , sir . Kaiju signature rising ! MAN : Sensor checks . That thing 's still alive , sir . Gipsy ! We 're still getting a signature ! That Kaiju is still alive ! Grab the boat and get out of there . You copy ? Grab the boat and get out of there now ! [ KAIJU ROARING ] Take it , Raleigh ! I got this ! [ SCREAMING ] Loccent , we 're hit !

[ SYSTEM POWERING DOWN ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ DISTANTLY ] Mister ? Can I help ? Yancy . Run ! Get help , fast ! It 's gonna be all right . TAYLOR : The Kaiju are learning our defenses . They 're adapting . Evolving . And we 're losing jaegers faster than we can build them . Lima . Seattle . Vladivostok . Category 4 Kaijus are now coming through the breach . I think even you can see , marshal , This is no longer a sound strategy . The frequency of the attacks has increased . The jaegers are not the most viable Line of defense anymore . I am aware . Those are my rangers that die every time a Jaeger falls , Which is why I 'm asking you for one last chance ... COLE : Excuse me , marshal . Excuse me ! ... one final assault with everything we 've got . Listen to me . The Jaeger program is dead , marshal . On the other hand , The coastal wall program is a promising option . TAYLOR : The world appreciates All that you and your men have done , But it 's over . We will authorize you To take all remaining jaegers TO THE LAST BATTLE STATION : Hong Kong . We 're prepared to fund you for the next eight months While the coastal wall is completed . After that , you will receive no further support . You have your answer , marshal . TENDO CHOI : So that 's it ? It 's over ? HERC : [ AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ] suits and ties , flashy smiles . That 's all they are , stacker . We don 't need ' em . [ WHISTLE BLOWS , TOOLS CLANKING ] [ INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A. ] [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] FOREMAN : Ration cards , guys ! Come on , come on ! Let 's go ! Now , I got good news and I got bad news , fellas . Which one you wanna hear first ? Bad news ! BAD NEWS : Three guys died yesterday working the top of the wall . [ WORKERS MURMUR ] MAN : What 's the good news ? The good news is , I got three new job openings . Top of the wall . Okay , who wants to work ? Who wants to eat ? [ CLAPS ] Come on ! [ MAN SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] WOMAN : I am here in Sydney , where earlier today , Yet another Kaiju attack took place . The Kaiju , an enormous category 4 , Broke through the coastal wall in less than an hour . [ KAIJU ROARS ] The wall of life had been deemed unbreachable By its builders . MAN : Why the hell are we even building ' this thing ? The creature entered the city through Sydney cove . That ... That thing Went through the wall like it was nothing . Ironically , it was The recently decommissioned Jaeger , striker eureka , Piloted by Herc and chuck Hansen , That finally took the beast down . [ KAIJU SCREECHES ] [ GROANS ] [ CAR ALARM BEEPING ] CHUCK : [ AUSTRALIAN ACCENT ] look , they decommissioned The Jaeger program because of mediocre pilots . It 's that simple . That 's striker eureka 's tenth kill to date . It 's a new record . And you 're still going to Hong Kong , Even at a time like this ? Well , orders are orders . What else am I supposed to do ? Come on , mate . WOMAN : Chuck Hansen , one of the pilots of striker eureka , The Jaeger that took down the Kaiju . Mr. Becket . Marshal . Looking sharp . Long time . Five years , four months . Can I have a word ? MAN : Attention , all zone three welders . Step into my office , marshal . Took me a while to find you . Anchorage , Sheldon point , Nome ... Yeah , a man in my position travels with the wall , Chasing shifts to make a livin ' . What do you want ? I 've spent the last six months Activating everything I can get my hands on . There 's an old Jaeger , a mark 3 . You may know it . It needs a pilot . I 'm guessing I wasn 't your first choice . You a my first choice . All the other mark 3 pilots are dead . [ SIGHS ] Look ... I can 't have anyone else in my head again . I 'm done . I was still connected to my brother when he died . I can 't go through that again , man , I 'm sorry . Haven 't you heard , Mr. Becket ? The world is coming to an end . So where would you rather die ? ! Here , or in a Jaeger ? ! [ RADIO CHATTER ] [ SHOUTING IN JAPANESE ] Mr. Becket , this is Mako Mori . One of our brightest . Also in charge of the mark 3 restoration program . She personally handpicked your copilot candidates . [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] Hey . [ SPEAKING JAPANESE ] PENTECOST : At ease . We will tour the facility first And then miss Mori will show you to your Jaeger , Mr. Becket . GOTTLIEB : Wait for us , please ! NEWT : Hold the door , please ! Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Stay back ! Kaiju specimens are extremely rare , So look but don 't touch , please . Mr. Becket , this is our research team . Dr. Gottlieb and dr . Geiszler . Oh , no , call me newt . Only my mother calls me doctor . [ CHUCKLES ] Hermann , these are human beings . Why don 't you say hello ? I have asked you not to refer to me by my first name around others . I am a doctor with over 10 years decorated experience ... [ MOCKING ] Oh , no , yes . I have ten ... 10 years of experience , man . I 'm very sorry . Oh , please . Who is that , Yamarashi ? Oh , this little Kaiju ? Yeah , you got a good eye . My brother and I took him down in 2017 . You know he was one of the biggest category 3s ever ? He was 2,500 tons of awesome . Or awful . You know , whatever you wanna call it . Yes , please excuse him . He 's a Kaiju groupie . He loves ... Shut up , Hermann , I don 't love them , okay ? I study them . And unlike most people , I wanna see one alive and up close one day . Trust me , you don 't want to . So that 's your research division ? Things have changed . [ LIGHT , RAPID BEEPING ] We 're not an army anymore , Mr. Becket . We 're the resistance . Welcome to the shatterdome . War clock . We reset it after every Kaiju attack . Keeps everyone focused . The frequency of attacks is accelerating . How long till the next reset ? A week , if we 're lucky . [ WHEELS SQUEAK ] My experts believe there 'll be a Kaiju attack Even before that . This complex used to lodge 30 jaegers In five bays just like this one . Now we only have four jaegers left . I didn 't know it was this bad . It is that bad . Crimson typhoon , china . One of the greatest . Assembled in Changzhou . Full titanium core , no alloys . Fifty diesel engines per muscle strand . Deadly , precise fighter . She 's piloted by the wei tang brothers . Triplets . Local lads . They 've successfully defended Hong Kong port seven times . They use the thundercloud formation . Oh , yeah . Triple-Arm technique . Very effective . That tank , last of the t-90s . Cherno alpha . First generation mark 1 . The heaviest and oldest Jaeger in the service . But make no mistake , Mr. Becket , it 's a brutal war machine . And those two , Sasha and Alexis Kaidanovksy . Yeah , I 've heard of ' em . Perimeter patrol , Siberian wall . On thei watch it stayed unbreached for six years . Six years . [ DOG BARKS ] PENTECOST : Herc ! Chuck ! Gentlemen , welcome to Hong Kong ! HERC : Wait here . MAKO : Max ! Come here ! [ DOG BARKS ] Remember me ? HERC : Don 't drool all over miss Mori . Hi . Sees a pretty girl and he gets all wound up . PENTECOST : Raleigh , this is Hercules Hansen , An old friend from the mark 1 glory days . I know you , mate . We rode together before . We did , sir . Six years ago . My brother and I. It was a three Jaeger team drop . That 's right . Manila . Sorry about your brother . Thank you , sir . Herc and his son chuck 'll be runnin ' point Usin ' striker eureka . Fastest Jaeger in the world . First and last of the mark 5s . Australia decommissioned it a day before the Sydney attack . Yeah , it was lucky we were still around . Yep . Now it 's runnin ' point for us . Wait , running point on what ? You haven 't told me what I 'm doing here yet . We 're going for the breach , Mr. Becket . We 're gonna strap a 2,400 pound Thermonuclear warhead to striker 's back . Detonate an equivalent of 1.2 million tons of TNT , And you and two other Jaegers 'll be runnin ' defense for them . Thought we were the resistance . Where 'd you get something that big ? See the Russians back there ? They can get us anything . Herc , shall we ? Good to have you back . Thank you , sir . I 'll show you to your Jaeger now . Miss Mori , will you give me a minute ? Marshal ! Sir , we 've hit the breach before . It doesn 't work . Nothing goes through . What 's changed ? I 've got a plan . I need you ready . That 's all . Let 's go , Herc ! CHUCK : Max , come here ! WOMAN : Crew 17 , please report to the fifth floor . Zero minus two . Xy minus two . R-E-Q . In the beginning , The Kaiju attacks were spaced by 24 weeks . Then twelve , then six , then every two weeks . The last one in Sydney was a week . In four days , we could be seeing a Kaiju every eight hours Until they are coming every four minutes . Marshal , we should witness a double event Within seven days . Mr. Gottlieb , I 'm to drop a 2,400 pound thermonuclear bomb . I need more than a prediction . Well , uh , that 's a problem , then Because see , he actually Can 't give you anything more than a prediction . No Kaiju entrails over my side of the room . You know the rules . Every bloody day . It 's incessant . Gents ! On point . [ SIGHS ] Numbers do not lie . Politics and poetry , promises , these are lies . Numbers are as close as we get to the handwriting of god . [ CHUCKLING ] What ? Would you give me a moment ? There will be a double event And then , shortly thereafter , three . And then four . PENTECOST : And then we 're dead . I get it . Alas . This is where the good news comes . Here is our universe , And here is theirs . And this is what we call " the throat , " The passage between the breach and us . We know that it 's atomic in nature . I predict that the increased traffic Will force the breach to stabilize And remain open long enough To get the device through ... and collapse its structure . Yeah , and that 's where I gotta chime in Because , really , I wouldn 't wanna go in there With that limited amount of information . Newton , don 't embarrass yourself . That 's what I was tryin ' to say . Just hear me out for a second . Give me a second , please . Why do we judge the Kaiju on a category system ? [ SYSTEM POWERS DOWN ] It 's because each one is completely different from the next , right ? You see what I 'm saying ? One looks like a shark and one looks like a fish ... Dr. Geiszler . Just get to the point . Yes . The point is I don 't think They 're all completely different after all . These are some samples I collected , all right ? Now , this one here was harvested in Sydney . And this was harvested in manila . 6 years ago . They have the same exact DNA . They 're clones . And this is the point where he goes completely crazy . There 's so much more to the Kaiju than we understand . And we 've really only scratched the surface . This is a piece of a Kaiju 's brain . Now , unfortunately , it 's damaged . It 's a little bit weak . But it 's still alive . Now , I think I can tap into it Using the same technology That allows the two Jaeger pilots to share a neural bridge . Now , think about that . I could tell you exactly How to get through the breach yourselves . You 're suggesting that we initiate a drift with a Kaiju ? No , no . No , no . Not like a whole Kaiju , you know , Just a tiny piece of its brain . The neural surge would be too much for the human brain . I agree . I don 't agree . [ SIGHS ] Gottlieb , I 'd like your data on my desk asap . Sir . No , but his is so ... Thank you , newt . Guys , now , this is the most amazing thing ... Newton , I know that you 're desperate to be right So you 've not wasted your life being a Kaiju groupie , But it 's not going to work . It is going to work , Hermann . And I 'll tell you something else . Fortune favors the brave , dude . You heard them . They won 't give you the equipment And even if they did , you 'd kill yourself . Well , I 'd be a rock star . There she is . [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Oh , my god . [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] Look at her . Gipsy danger . God , it 's so beautiful . She looks like new . MAKO : Better than new . She has a double-Core nuclear reactor . She 's one of a kind now . She always was . TENDO CHOI : How do you like your ride , Becket boy ? Solid iron hull , no alloys . Forty engine blocks per muscle strands . Hyper-Torque driver for every limb And a new fluid synapse system . Come here . Tendo . It 's good to see you , buddy . It 's good to see you too , brother . It 's just like old times . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] So what 's your story ? [ BAG UNZIPS ] Restoring old jaegers , Showing has-Beens like me around . That can 't be it . You a pilot ? No . No yet . But I wanna be one , more than anything . What 's your simulator score ? 51 drops , 51 kills . Wow , that 's amazing . But you 're not one of the candidates tomorrow ? I am not . The marshal has his reasons . Yeah , he always does , doesn 't he ? But with 51 kills , I can 't imagine what they could be . I hope you approve of my choices . I 've studied your fighting techniques and strategy . Even ... Alaska . And what do you think ? I think [ SIGHS ] you 're unpredictable . You have a habit of deviating From standard combat techniques . You take risks and injure yourself and your crew . I don 't think you 're the right man for this mission . Wow . Thank you for your honesty . You might be right . But one day , when you 're a pilot , You 're gonna see that in combat you make decisions . And you have to live with the consequences . That 's what I 'm trying to do . [ DOOR SLAMS ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] The candidates are ready . We will commence the trials immediately , sir . Good . But there is one thing . We ... Mako , we have talked about this . We will not be talking about it again . Hm ? You promised me . Mako . Vengeance is like an open wound . You cannot take that level of emotion into the drift . For my family , I need ... [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] HERC : Raleigh . Come sit with us . Oh , I 'm okay , thank you . Ah , come on , there 's plenty of room at our table . I haven 't seen bread in awhile . Hong Kong . Beauty of an open port , no rationing . We 've got potatoes , peas , sweet beans , decent meat loaf . Pass the potatoes . Raleigh , this is my son , chuck . He 's my copilot now . He 's more my copilot , right , dad ? So you 're the guy , eh ? You 're the guy who 's gonna run defense for me In that old rust bucket of yours ? That 's the plan . Good . [ DOG CHOMPS ] So when was the last time you jockeyed , ray ? About five years ago . What have you been doin for five years ? Something pretty important , I reckon . I was in construction . Oh , wow , that 's great . I mean , that 's really useful . Uh , you know , we get into a fight , You can build our way out of it , eh , ray ? It 's Raleigh . Whatever . Look , you 're Pentecost 's bright idea . My old man , he seems to like you , But it 's guys like you who brought down the Jaeger program . To me , you 're dead weight . You slow me down , I 'm gonna drop you like a sack of Kaiju shit . [ CLICKS TONGUE ] I 'll see you around , Raleigh . Come , max . [ PANTING ] You can blame me for that one . I 've raised him on my own . He 's a smart kid , but I never knew Whether to give him a hug or a kick in the ass . With respect , sir ... I 'm pretty sure which one he needs . [ APPLAUSE ] 4 points to zero . 4 points to 1 . [ APPLAUSE ] 4 points to 2 . Okay , what ? You don 't like ' em ? I thought you selected them personally . Excuse me ? Every time a match ends You make this little gesture , Like you 're critical of their performance . It 's not their performance , it 's yours . Your gambit . You could have taken all of them two moves earlier . You think so ? I know so . Can we change this up ? How ' bout we give her a shot ? MAN : Yeah ! [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] No . We stick to the cadet list we have , ranger . Only candidates with drift compatibility ... Which I have , marshal . Mako , this is not only about a neural connection . It 's also about a physical compatibility . What 's the matter , marshal ? Don 't think your brightest can cut it in the ring with me ? Go . Four strikes marks a win . Remember , it 's about compatibility . It 's a dialogue , not a fight . But I 'm not gonna dial down my moves . Okay . Then neither will I. 1-0 . [ GRUNTS LOUDLY ] 1-1 . 2-1 . Concentrate . 2-2 . Better watch it . [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] 3-2 . Mori-San . [ BOTH GRUNTING ] [ CROWD GROANS ] Enough . [ APPLAUSE ] I 've seen what I need to see . Me too . She 's my copilot . That 's not going to work . Why not ? Because I said so , Mr. Becket . I made my decision . Report to the shatterdome in two hours And find out who your copilot will be . Mako . What was all that about ? I mean , I 'm not crazy . You felt it , right ? We are drift compatible . Thank you for standing up for me . But there is nothing to talk about . That 's my room . Excuse me . I mean , come on . I thought you wanted to be a pilot . [ DOOR OPENS ] Mako , this is worth fighting for . We don 't have to just obey him . It 's not obedience , Mr. Becket . It 's respect . Would you at least tell me what his problem is ? WOMAN : In the wake of the Sydney incident , Which showed the ineffective nature Of the wall of life program , Many are questioning the government 's motives And wondering why the Jaeger program has been discontinued . Riots have erupted along the coastlines Of several pan pacific cities . MAN : We have now relocated millions of civilians And supplies 300 miles inland to the safe zones . Woman # 2 : Safe zones ? For the rich and powerful ? What about the rest of us ? MAN : Yeah , answer the question . I believe the wall of life Is still our best option at this time . And that 's all I 'm gonna say on the matter . Than ... Thank you . Kaiju / human drift experiment , take one . The , uh ... The brain segment is the frontal lobe . Um , chances are ... the segment 's far too damaged to drift with . UNSCIENTIFIC ASIDE : Hermann , if you 're listening to this , Well , I 'm either alive And I 've proven what I 've just done works ... in which case , ha , I won . Or I 'm dead and I 'd like you to know that it 's all your fault . It really is , you know . You drove me to this . In which case , ha , I also won . Sort of . I 'm going in in three ... two ... one . Hah ! [ DISTORTED AUDIO ] GOTTLIEB : Newton . Newton ! What have you done ? WOMAN : Gipsy danger neural test Commencing in 20 minutes . Gipsy danger neural test commencing in 20 minutes . [ WOMEN GIGGLE ] Gipsy danger neural test commencing in 20 minutes . [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Mm . May I come in , Mako ? All pilots report to mess hall . A long time ago , I made you a promise . These transmitters are non-Operative . I need them replaced . RALEIGH : Setting harness for test mode . Waiting for second pilot . GIPSY DANGER AI : Two pilots on board . I 'm gonna take this side if you don 't mind . My left arm 's kinda shot . Sure . Are you gonna say anything ? No point . In five minutes you 're gonna be inside my head . You look good . Pilots on board and ready to connect . Prepare for neural handshake . Initiating neural handshake . We 're not in the simulator now , Mako . Remember , don 't chase the rabbit . Random access brain impulse triggers . Memories . Just let ' em flow , don 't latch on . Tune ' em out . Stay in the drift . The drift is silence . Neural interface drift initiated . [ CHILDREN LAUGHING ] Look , Raleigh ! Over there ! Mama ! YANCY : Raleigh , listen to me ! Raleigh , listen to me ! [ GASPS ] Right hemisphere calibrated . Left hemisphere calibrated . Ready to activate the Jaeger . Okay , gipsy . Lining up nicely . Better get ready . Pilot to Jaeger connection complete . GOTTLIEB : Marshal ! Marshal ! I need to talk to you . Not now , Mr. Gottlieb . I 'm sure you can appreciate How important this moment is to me . Newton created a neural bridge From garbage and drifted with a Kaiju . GOTTLIEB : I found him prone , and he 's sort of dazed . I don 't exactly know what to do . I told you it would work . Yes , you did . Well , what 'd you see ? You know , it was only a fragment of a brain , So really all I was able to get was , like , a series Of , uh , images or ... Or impressions . You know ? Like when you blink your eyes over and over and over again All you really see are , like , frames . Um , it was emotional in the ... Newton , Newton . Okay , Newton . It was so ... Newton , look at me . Now I want you to take your time and be very specific . Okay . Well , I don 't feel like They 're just following some sort of animalistic urge , You know , just hunting and gathering . And I think they 're attacking us under orders . That 's impossible . Is that impossible ? It 's impossible . Because ... You know what ? Why don 't you drift with a Kaiju ? ! You ! Shut up ! Yes , sir . You , keep talking . [ BREATHING SHAKILY ] These beings , these masters , they 're colonists . They overtake worlds . They just ... They just consume them and then ... Then , they move on to the next . And they 've been here before in sort of a trial run . It was the dinosaurs . But the atmosphere wasn 't conducive , right ? So they waited it out . And they waited it out . And now , you know , with ozone depletion , And carbon monoxide , polluted waters ... Well , we 've practically terraformed it for them . 'Cause now they 're coming back , and it 's perfect . See , the first wave , that was just the hounds . Categories 1 through 4 , it was nothing . Their sole purpose was to aim for the populated areas And take out the vermin ... Us ! The second wave , that is the exterminators . And they will finish the job . And then , the new tenants will take possession . See , the reason that I found the identical DNA In the two separate Kaiju organs is because they are grown ! Newton , I need you to do it again . I need more information . Wh ... ? I can 't ... I can 't do it again . I-I mean , not unless you have A fresh Kaiju brain lying around . Do you ? [ APPLAUSE ] Pretty impressive . Yeah , he remembers how to turn it on . Oi , show some respect . When his brother died , He got the Jaeger back to shore on his own . I 've known one other pilot 's been able to do that . Now , there are certain individuals Whose business is the preservation And exploitation of Kaiju remains . Yeah , right , black market dealers , right ? Yep . They 're in and out in a matter of hours . They neutralize the acidic factor of the blood , And they harvest what they need . Now , this guy , this is Hannibal Chau . He runs the Kaiju black market here in Asia . When our funding ran out , We turned to him for help , and in return , I gave him exclusive rights To all Kaiju remains in the region . You did that ? Last days of war , gentlemen . Go to the corner of fong and tull . Show them that card . Look for that symbol . And a word to the wise , do not trust him . Calibration complete . YANCY : The hull ! It went through the hull ! Raleigh , listen to me ! You need ... [ SCREAMING ] Pilot out of alignment . Both out of alignment . Both of them ? [ ALARM BEEPING ] Both of them . Gipsy , gipsy ! You 're out of alignment ! You are both out of alignment . I 'm okay . Just let me control it . GIPSY DANGER AI : Pilot two , out of alignment . TENDO CHOI : You 're stabilizing . But Mako is way out . Mako . She 's starting to chase the rabbit ! Mako , don 't get stuck in a memory . [ DISTANTLY ] Stay with me . Stay in the now . Don 't engage in a memory . Mako . Mako !

Weapon system engaged ! Go to fail-Safe ! Fail-Safe not responding . There 's a problem with the neural blocker ! Her connection 's way too strong ! Fully charged . Mako ! Mako , listen to me . This is just a memory . None of it is real . [ BREATHING RAPIDLY ] HERC : The power line ! The power line ! Get the main power line ! [ WHIMPERING ] Take them offline ! Take them offline ! [ GRUNTS ] I just did . Weapon system disengaged . Mako ! Neural bridge exercise invalid . [ AIR HISSES ] It 's okay . It 's okay . Drift sequence terminated . Would you like to try again ? [ HORNS HONKING , INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] [ BICYCLE BELL DINGING ] [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] Hello . [ FROG CROAKING ] Pss-Psst . You looking for some Kaiju bone powder ? S-Some bone ... ? Some bone powder ? Uh , no , why would I want that ? Male potency . [ GRUNTS ] I take it myself . I see . Uh , no , thank you . I 'm looking for Hannibal Chau . [ DOOR LOCKS ] Come . Hannibal Chau , huh ? Good luck . Oh , my god ! Oh , my god , this place is heaven ! That 's a lymph gland from a category 2 ! And what are you working on here ? Is this a cuticle ? In mint condition ? Is that a Kaiju skin parasite ? I 've never seen them alive before ! They-They usually die as soon as the Kaiju falls ! I thought you couldn 't keep them alive ! HANNIBAL : You can if you soak 'em in ammonia . What do you want ? I 'm looking for Hannibal Chau . I was told he was here . [ JINGLING ] Who wants to know ? I really can 't say . Aah ! Aah ! Stacker Pentecost sent me ! [ SHING ! ] Aah ! Aah ! Oh , that 's great . That 's real great . So I take it you 're Hannibal Chau , right ? You like the name ? I took it from , uh ... my favorite historical character And my second-Favorite Szechuan restaurant in Brooklyn . Now tell me what you want , Before I gut you like a pig and feed you to the skin louse . CHUCK : She can 't control her drift , And he went out of phase first ! PENTECOST : We all know what happened . We can 't afford mistakes , the Kaiju keep evolving , They keep kicking our asses ! He 's a has-Been , she 's a rookie . I don 't want them protecting my bomb run , sir . [ DOOR UNLOCKS ] You need to watch your tone , Mr. Hansen . Hey , stay there . Give me a moment . [ DOOR CLOSES FIRMLY ] You two are a goddamn disgrace . You 're gonna get us all killed , AND HERE 'S THE THING , RALEIGH : I want to come back from this mission 'Cause I quite like my life . So why don 't you just do us all a favor and disappear ? It 's the only thing you 're good at . Stop ! Now ! Yeah , that 's right . You just hold back your little girlfriend . One of you bitches needs a leash . [ CROWD GROANS ] Apologize to her . Screw you . Aah ! [ CROWD GROANS ] Aah ! I said apologize to her . AAH ! HERC : Hey ! Hey ! Enough ! What 's going on ? On your feet , both of you ! Becket , Mori , into my office , now . No , we aren 't finished ! Hey ! Hey ! This is over ! You 're a ranger , for Chrissake . Why don 't you start acting like one ? I went out of phase first . It was my mistake . No . It was my mistake . I should have never let you two in the same machine . So , what ? You 're grounding us ? Not you . Permission to be dismissed , sir . Permission granted , miss Mori . Mako . Sir , what are you doing ? She is the strongest candidate by far . What other options do we have ? Huh ? Tell me ! Do not let my calm demeanor fool you , ranger ! Now is not a good moment for your insubordination ! Mako is too inexperienced To rein in her memories during combat . That 's not why you grounded her . I was in her memories . I saw everything . I don 't care what you think you saw . [ KAIJU ROARS , WEAPONS FIRING ] [ WHIMPERING ] [ GASPING ] [ THUDDING ] [ AIR HISSING ] I know what she means to you . I saw it ! I ... Hey ! Hey ! This conversation is over . Marshal . Marshal , can we just talk about this for one second ? ! You rescued her . You raised her . You 're not protecting her now . You are holding her back . ONE : Don 't you ever touch me again . TWO : Don 't you ever touch me again . Now , you have no idea who the hell I am Or where I 've come from , And I 'm not about to tell you my whole life story . All I need to be to you and everybody in this dome Is a fixed point . The last man standing . I do not need your sympathy or your admiration . All I need is your compliance and your fighting skills . And if I can 't get that , Then you can go back to the wall That I found you crawling on . Do I make myself clear ? [ INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A. ] Yes , sir . Good . [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] [ CONVERSATIONS STOP ] RALEIGH : I 'm sorry . I should 've warned you . First drifts are rough . But you weren 't just tapping into my memories . You were tapping into my brother 's too . When Yancy was taken , we were still connected . I felt his fear , his pain , His helplessness , and then ... he was gone . I felt it . I know . You know , you live in someone else 's head for so long The hardest part to deal with is the silence . To let someone else in , to really connect , You have to trust them . And today the drift was strong . [ OBJECT THUMPS ] Her heart . When 's the last time you saw it ? Not in a long time . GIPSY DANGER AI : Movement in the breach . Double event . Two signatures . Dilation indicator , category 4 . [ KAIJU ROARS ] Excuse me . TENDO CHOI : The breach was exposed at 2300 hours . We have two signatures , both category 4s . CODE NAMES : Otachi and leatherback . They 'll reach Hong Kong within the hour . Evacuate the city . Shut down the bridges . I want every single civilian in a refuge right now . Crimson typhoon , cherno alpha , I want you to frontline the harbor . Stay on the miracle mile . Striker , I want you to stay back , Look after the coastline . We cannot afford to lose you , So only engage as a final option . BOTH : Yes , sir ! You two . You stay put . Let 's go ! Loccent , striker 's got the ball and we 're on the roll . Loccent ... near positions and awaiting your orders . Remain in the miracle mile . Engage at your discretion . Guys , keep your eyes open . These category 4s are the biggest we 've ever seen , Both in size and weight . ALEKSIS : Cherno alpha reaching target zone . Disengaging transport . Cherno alpha in position . Miracle mile . Cherno alpha holding the coastline . Beacon is on . [ SOLEMN CHANTING ] HANNIBAL : Look at ' em . They believe the Kaiju are sent from heaven . That the gods are expressing their displeasure With our behavior . The silly bastards . And what do you believe ? Well ... I believe that Kaiju bone powder is 500 bucks a pound . What do you want ? I need to access a Kaiju brain . Completely intact . No , no , no . The skull plate is so dense That by the time you drill into it ... The brain 's rotted away . But I 'm talking about the secondary brain . Now we both know that the Kaiju are so large They need two brains to move around , like a dinosaur . I want to get my hands on that . Mm . What the hell do you want a secondary brain for , anyway ? I mean , every part of the Kaiju sells . Cartilage , spleen , liver . Even the crap ! One cubic meter of crap Has enough phosphorous in it to fertilize a whole field ! But the brain ... too much ammonia . So what 's the deal , little fella ? Well , that 's classified . So I couldn 't tell you . Even if I wanted to . Mm . But it is pretty cool . So I might tell you . I 'm gonna tell you . I figured out how to drift with a Kaiju . Are you funnin ' me , son ? It 's fascinating how their minds work . Every single Kaiju , his mind 's connected . The species has like a ... Like a hive mind . [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] Holy Jesus . You 've gone and done it , haven 't you ? I did it a little bit , yeah . You goddamn moron . [ KAIJU ROARS ] [ GRUNTING ] [ BOTH GRUNTING ] [ SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN ] Loccent !

Jesus , we can 't just sit here and watch ' em die . Come on ! Ah , screw this . Loccent , we 're movin ' in now ! [ SHRIEKING ] ALEKSIS : Cherno alpha , we 've been hit with some type of acid ! Come on ! Hull has been compromised . We need backup immediately ! Just hold on , cherno ! We 're on our way ! Our power move ! Yeah ! [ GASPING ] [ FLATLINE ] TENDO CHOI : We just lost cherno , sir . [ RAPID BEEPING ] [ BOTH GRUNTING ] Engaging air missiles !

Loccent ! I 've never seen that before . Loccent ! They 're adapting . This isn 't a defense mechanism , it 's a weapon ! Get me striker ! Nothing , sir . The mark 5 's digital 's fried . It 'll take me two hours to reroute the auxiliary . All the jaegers , they 're digital ! Not all of them , marshal . Gipsy 's analog . Nuclear . We got two Kaijus . We gotta get out . Hang on a second . Excuse me . Wh-What 's going on ? There are two goddamn Kaiju Headed straight for Hong Kong city . No , no , no . That 's not possible . There 's never been two before . Well , maybe that 's ' cause Nobody ever drifted with one before , eh , genius ? ! When Jaeger pilots drift , it 's a two-Way street . A bridge , right ? Of course . Yes ! It sets up a connection . Both ways ! " A hive mentality , " you said ! Maybe those Kaiju are tryin ' to find you . What ... What 're we gonna do ? I 'm gonna wait out this shitstorm In my own private Kaiju bunker . But you are going to a public refuge . I tried it once . Once . Now get the hell outta here . [ GUNS COCKING ] [ KAIJU ROARING ] [ ALARMS WAILING , BICYCLE BELLS RINGING ] NEWT : Excuse me ! Aah !

Now you and I are the only thing Standin ' between that ugly bastard And a city of 2 million people . Now we have a choice here . We either sit and wait Or we take these flare guns And do something really stupid . [ AIR HISSES ] [ KAIJU GROWLING ] [ GRUNTS ] How 's your arm ? Ah , just give me the gun . Hey , you !

Germans are gonna go nuts for that stuff . [ SNAPS FINGERS ] let me see that map . Here is where the Kaiju fell , Here 's where we concentrate our efforts . We 'll get it , boss . Right . NEWT : Hey ! Okay , guess who 's back , you one-Eyed bitch ? And you owe me a Kaiju brain . [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HERC : Raleigh ! My kid 'd never admit it ... but he 's grateful . We both are . [ DOOR OPENS ] PENTECOST : Mr. Becket ! Miss Mori ! In all of my years fighting ... I 've never seen anything like that . Well done . Proud of you . Proud of us all . But ... as harsh as it sounds , there is no time to celebrate . We lost two crews . No time to grieve . Reset that clock . [ CROWD MURMURING ] Reset the clock . [ CONVERSING IN CHINESE ] [ PARASITES SCREECHING ] I still can 't believe what you did to me . I mean , I coulda been eaten . Well , that was definitely the plan . Lucky for you , that didn 't become necessary , huh ? Okay . Thank you so much . You 're so kind . I really appreciate all of this . But now do you mind tellin ' me exactly what is taking so long For your workers to get that brain ? Well , they pump the cavity full of co2 , Just like in any other laparoscopic surgery . Okay , yes , obviously , The co2 's gonna delay the acidic reaction , yes . And it allows us to harvest . But our boys need oxygen pumped into their suits . They move slow . What 's goin ' on in there , boys ? MAN : We 've reached ... [ ECHOING ] The upper pelvic area . [ GRUNTS ] Moving to the 25th vertebra . Shit . Even through the suit , boss , It smells like dead catfish in here . Boss . The secondary brain ... is damage . Oh . It 's ruin . Destroy . Bitch ! How could they screw that up ? ! Wait . Wait . What was that ? Did he say " wait " ? Why wait ? Do you hear that ? It 's like a heartbeat . [ RHYTHMIC PULSING ] Oh , my god . Oh , my god , this can 't be . Hold on a second . Hey !

[ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ GASPS ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN DISTANCE ] HANNIBAL : I knew it . Aah ! Gone . His lungs weren 't fully formed . Umbilical cord tied around his neck . No way he could survive outside the womb For more than a minute . One look , that 's all I needed . I knew he wouldn 't make it . [ GRUNTS ] [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] Ugly little bastard . Anyway , I woulda ... [ ROARS ] Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] Huh . [ SHOE CLATTERS ] [ COUGHS ] How sick are you ? And why didn 't you tell me ? [ SIGHS ] Ah . What 's to tell ? You know , them mark 1s , We scraped them bad boys together in 14 months . Last thing we were thinking about was radiation shielding . I ran nearly a dozen missions . I stayed under the medical radar for awhile But the last time I jockeyed was Tokyo . I finished the fight solo , but for three hours ... I burned . They warned me if I ever stepped foot into a Jaeger again , The toll would be too much . You and I are the only two that ever ran solo combat . That 's why I brought you here . [ DEVICE BEEPING , BELL DINGING ] What is it ? Sir , it 's happening . I just got two signatures With unprecedented dilation , 40-Meter spikes . What category ? Checking the ratios , category four . Where 're they headed ? That 's the thing , they 're not heading ' anywhere . They 're hovering just above the breach . It 's ... It 's like they 're protecting it or something . All right , gipsy , striker , on deck . Sir , Herc cannot ride . His arm ... You heard me . Two signatures . Two ? ! There are ... There are two Kaiju signatures in the breach , Not three like I predicted ? ! Hermann ! I haven 't exactly had a very good day , okay ? ! I got about 5 minutes ... should be three Kaijus . ... before brain death occurs here ! I don 't wanna spend it talking about your theories ! This is all wrong ! There should be three Kaijus coming through , not two ! There should be three and there 's two ? I 'm sorry , it hurts to be wrong , doesn 't it , Hermann ? I am not wrong , but there is something here that we don 't understand . Okay . Hermann , hopefully we can argue about any mistakes You made in your predictive model in the future ! But in the meantime , The neural interface is way off the charts ! If you want to help , help with that ! Newton , I am not wrong . There is only one way to make sure ... and that is to do this ... together . I 'll go with you . That 's what the Jaeger pilots do , Share the neural load . You 're serious ? You ... You would do that for me ? Or you would do that with me ? Well , with worldwide destruction a certain alternative ... do I really have a choice ? THEN SAY IT WITH ME , MY MAN : " we 're gonna own this bad boy ! " By Jove , we are going to own this thing for sure ! [ LAUGHS ] Oi , Tendo . Tendo ! You 're not suited up . Yeah , I 'm aware of that , Elvis . I need to know what 's going on . He said suit up , so suit up . Tendo , I can 't pilot striker on my own , now , can I ? ! Dad 's hurt , so who 's gonna be my copilot ? [ DOOR OPENS ] I don 't remember it being so tight . Getting back into that Jaeger will kill you . Not gettin ' into one would kill us all . Listen , you are a brave girl . I 'm so lucky to have seen you grow . But if I 'm going to do this ... I need you to protect me . Can you do that ? Hey . Everyone , listen up ! Today ... today ... at the edge of our hope ... at the end of our time ... we have chosen not only to believe in ourselves , But in each other . Today there 's not a man nor woman in here That shall stand alone . Not today . Today we face the monsters that are at our door And bring the fight to them ! Today we are canceling the apocalypse ! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ INDISTINCT TALKING OVER P.A. ] Go to the safety zone right now . CHUCK : Hey , marshal ! You know , that was a great speech , But how exactly are you and I Supposed to match up in there ? I carry nothing into the drift . No memories , no fear . No rank . And as for you ... well , you 're easy . You 're an egotistical jerk with daddy issues . A simple puzzle I solved on day one . [ DOG BARKS ] But you are your father 's son ... so we 'll drift just fine . Works for me . Hey , now . When you drift with someone , You feel like there 's nothing to talk about . I just don 't want to regret All the things that I never said out loud . Don 't . [ SIGHS ] You don 't need to . I know them all . I always have . [ DOG BARKS ] Hey . Hey , handsome . [ DOG WHIMPERS ] Oh , I 'm gonna miss you . You look after him for me . Stacker . That 's my son you got there . My son . You know , Mako , all those years I spent living ' in the past , I never really thought about the future . Until now . [ CHUCKLES ] I never did have very good timing . [ RADIO CHATTER ] You ready for this ? Oh , yes , yes . Initiating neural handshake in 5 ... 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 . [ EXCLAIMS ] [ COUGHING ] Are you okay ? Yes , of course . I 'm completely fine . [ VOMITS ] The drift . You saw it ? Yeah . Did you ? Listen , we have to warn them . The jaegers ... The breach ... The plan ... It 's not going to work . TENDO CHOI : Disengaging transport . CHUCK : Loccent , all ports sealed . Ready to submerge . RALEIGH : All ports sealed . Ready to submerge . MAN : Both neural handshakes at 100 % . Neural handshake confirmed , sir . Two actives still in circle formation in the Guam quadrant . CODE NAMES : Scunner , Raiju . Both category 4 . PENTECOST : Roger that . Half a mile to the ocean cliff , we jump ! It 's 3,000 meters to the breach . Half a mile ? ! I can 't even see a damn inch ahead ! How are we supposed to deliver the bomb ? Visibility 's zero . Switching to instruments now .

Bogeys are stopping . HERC : Striker ! Bogeys are stopping . One o 'clock . Marshal , what are you doing ? ! They 're stopping . Why the hell are they stopping ? ! I don 't give a damn , sir ! We 're 300 meters from the jump ! Something 's not right ! HERC : Striker , the bogeys aren 't following . Take the leap now ! NEWT : Don 't do it ! Don 't do it , it 's not gonna work ! Move , you fascist ! Blowing up the breach , it 's not gonna work ! What do you mean ? What 's not gonna work ? Sir , just because the breach is open Does not mean you 're gonna be able to get a bomb through . GOTTLIEB : The breach genetically reads the Kaiju Like a barcode at the supermarket and then lets them pass . Okay , so you 're gonna have to fool the breach Into thinking that you have the same code ! And how are we supposed to do that ? By making it think you are a Kaiju . You have to lock onto the Kaiju , ride it into the breach . The throat will then read The Kaiju 's genetic code and let you pass . If you don 't do it , the bomb will deflect off the breach Like it always has and the mission will fail . All right , now that you 've heard all that , Striker , take the leap ! Sir ! I have a third signature emerging from the breach ! Third signature emerging from the breach . It 's a triple event . Oh , god , I was right . How big is it ? What category ? Category 5 . Striker , It 's a category 5 . The first ever . [ ROARS ] [ ROARS ] RALEIGH : Striker , we see him . We 're right behind you , about 100 meters .

Gipsy is nuclear ! Take her to the breach ! I hear you , sir . Headin ' for the breach . GIPSY DANGER AI : Structural damage , 80 % . Now ... PENTECOST : Mako . Listen . You can finish this . I 'll always be here for you . You can always find me in the drift . [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] We 're a walking nuclear reactor . We can destroy the breach . [ ROARS ] CHUCK : What can we do , sir ? We can clear a path ! For the lady ! They 're gonna detonate the payload . WELL , MY FATHER ALWAYS SAID : He said if you have the shot , you take it ! So let 's do this ! It was a pleasure , sir .

Critical level . We did it . I can finish this alone . All I have to do is fall . Anyone can fall . TENDO CHOI : Raleigh , your oxygen levels are critical now . You don 't have much time . Start the core meltdown and get out of there . Do you hear me ? Get out of there now ! One pod is ejected . No detonation , sir . Loccent , if you can still hear me , I 'm initiating reactor override now . [ RAPID BEEPING ] GIPSY DANGER AI : Manual activation required . What 's goin ' on ? ! Trigger 's offline !

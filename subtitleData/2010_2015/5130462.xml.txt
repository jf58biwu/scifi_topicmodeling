 Colony ARK monthly basis ore I Crew : 4 men A 187-day mission a year I alert the storm I alert the storm emergency situation . A meteor shower . I isolated rain of meteors . Just a detector . - How I did not see it ? - We 're as surprised as you . I this is not a satisfactory response . I Give me a damage report . decompress the external repository . Apparently he was hit second escape capsule . What the hell ... Madsen ? Received , over ? Streaming inactive I ~ ~ - telecommunications , have fallen . I ~ 09 ~ Fault aggregate filter - It 's a good ... I emergency alarm . All crew stations . Johns , wake up ! We have an emergency . Legs shake and fuck up ! Blackout in bays one and two . Decrease power . Here Commander Gerard Brauchman , ARK on monthly basis . I officially declare new Code . Immediate evacuation of the entire crew to Earth . I repeat : we are in a state of emergency . Request immediate launch of the shuttle . Personnel evacuation to Earth . Fault I span three oxygen filter . Level four and growing . What the hell happened to levels from one to three ? I was knock a meteor storm . Telecommunications , fell . Losing power . # We reserve the power and I lost escape capsule . - Both solar panels are damaged . - Can anyone stop that ? I transferred commands . - See if you can reconnect with the base . - Understand . UA E ª Þ I I can not breathe . I ... ? Krauss , see aeraþia reserve . - Johns , are you okay ? - Yes , well . backup systems , active . Reduction Functions . oxygen level stabilizes . A meteor broke a hole through the roof span three . - Hit and carbon monoxide filter . - Come Johns , have to isolate that area . - And quickly , drain poison station . - Get welding equipment . - Sealed airlock . - Soon . - I 'll go . - No , you can ... I repaired and coca , I got it . Good , close each of span locks you . Otherwise , sparking 're in a chain reaction and everybody decompression send us to hell . Okay , now I work in a relaxed ... Doctor , I want to go the energy cells . Perhaps save time by enabling backup filter pumps . I left . You ready , Cameron ? Done . When I open the lock , and comes much debris compressed carbon monoxide . - So welded fast as you can . - Good . I Cameron , I hear over They destroyed all the costumes output , except one . It burned a little , but good . 's Too risky . Cameron and the smallest cracks in costume and you could be sucked into the vacuum . Cancel the mission ? 'm Airlock span three . Gravitational activate it outside . Is about running out of time ... S do . Undocumented bravery . If you look bad year . Keep . Out now . - Open airlock and get your transfer orders . - Yes , sir . Do not hang the door in bay three . Is blocked ! I - Close it and uatã - I should cancel ? - Will be leakage station . - Security , keep two . Continue the mission ! Estimate damage me . Still keeps sleepers . Carbon monoxide level is off the charts . Severe impact . Must be damaged and four bays . So sealing is paramount . Must close thing . Gotta go filtration unit and to get the hell out of there . I see what we have here No , I do not see anything you 're on your own . I Where exactly is meteor new cylinder was stuck , between it and the filter . Meteor 's stiff . Try it out . Cameron , come ! I Cameron , I hear not going anywhere . - I need to guide the valve . - Right underneath . Valve should be right underneath right . 's Damaged valve , I covered leak . Monoxide leak stopped , have to go from there . - Are on the verge of collapse . - Cameron , get out of there , you hear ? I Cameron ... Cameron ! Cameron , I hear ? Cameron , copy ? Answer I , Lieutenant 'm airlock span three . Come on . And , if you can , close the hatch span two . - Dom ' colonel-ngroa and joked it ! - Spans four cede ! Christ , Cameron is still there ! Put ​ ​ your mask . Ava ! Cameron ... Where are you ? - Here . - Did you hear ? Are you okay ? If you grasp this , try to get out on her . - I stood up . - Good ! Come on ! Are you okay ? Thank God , I thought I lost you . Right , but I inhaled monocarboxylic acid . - Come on ! - Yes , we ... Bruce should be to look at it . - Got some kind of increase it . - Come on , get out of here ! The less we leave the station poison , the better it will be . Okay , go ! Okay , keep gasket . Enough to stop leakage in the cabins . - You 've given us a great show . - Thanks . Lieutenant , you 're exposed to chemicals , get in the shower . Lieutenant ... Good work . Same . - Where are we ? - We 're good . It was a little close . 95 % of the base has no power , so I , fix it until the backup generator , will have to work in the dark . - We have only 72 hours . - Measured by the standard procedures . 92 hours to 72 hours and still launch until rescue mission for us . - So we must win and tigãm some time . - What about the escape capsule ? Not an option , there in only two . We still have traces of gas leak . Carbon monoxide level is abnormal . Dom ' doctor ... ? Johns . 's CO is odorless , no color , no taste . Neurological manifestations of poisoning include hallucinations , disorientation , headache , gas gangrene , vision ... - And death . - Super , and more good news . Solutions ? 'm On . Keep an eye one another and if one of us sees another Showing any of these symptoms , Come live with me , understand ? Understood . I want to try and remove as much carbon monoxide possible here opening the filter still operational . Close the lock . I hazard . Sas open . good news is that functioned . The carbon monoxide minimal . Bad news is that squeezed and more energy in cells . - If solar panels fix it ? - Costumes , and destroyed . - Damn right we Are uaþi . - Johns , you 're the engineer . Come with solutions , or you can breathe in space ? Lance stops installation for drilling , squeeze vital energy systems . - Good , now . - I 'll go . If the doctor could look at meteor That one ... has some kind of spores attach . What do you mean some kind of increase ? Call of alien infection agent . Should immediately put in quarantine . We are not here to play games savanþii , goal is to save our skins . - Got it ? - I got it . And I see that 's very important . If you start to feel dezorientaþi or abnormal in any way , be mild and auditory or visual hallucinations , Come to me immediately . Scientists ... I The installation of drilling at rest . Should reduce the power consumption . Ava , can you come here ? You have to see this . - You isolation ? - Yeah , come and get it concerns . I I 've never seen anything like . Kind of shaped cell structure old , I being reproduced in an incredible pace . What ? I have a sample there . Running tests , see what you find . Here ARK monthly basis , Colonel Brauchman , to base . Answer ! Madsen ? Are you there ? You hear me ? Madsen , if you can hear me , I closed whole mining operations . I currently used only for emergency lights . I Confirms please receipt for the escape pod . Here U.S. monthly basis ARK Colonel Brauchman , to base . Answer ! A was passed through three different tests , all with identical results . Waxed meteor can reproduce without carbon , oxygen , hydrogen and nitrogen . Looks like a triggers exposure to light . Yo , bro , if you tell them what it is , I just entered a science fiction film . I can multiply and produce nutrients by themselves . - As bacteria ? - Just that much intelligence . Spores are dormant codes , but nobody knows how show multiply . Might turn total , change , develop ... Developed what ? Who knows ? But the growth rate is absolutely extraordinary . a hundred times faster like any cell in the human body . Are you okay ? Yes . I feel a bit of nausea . I 'm going to lie down . Good . Easy ... Take it easy . Where am I ? The infirmary . Why you 're all here ? What happened ? - No , It 's okay ... - What do I do ? - Relax , Ava ... - What is happening ? - Jesus ... ! - Cover it ! Come Johns . Now the hall . Need to breathe ... Look at me , right ? Listen ... You gotta breathe , breathe ... Slowly but calm down , okay ? I 'm here . Ava , you listen to me now , right ? A and A. .. You what appears to be an extremely accelerated . So , Ava ... I can not explain . Simply can not be that fast . - You can not . - Good ... I argue that on the What ... ? Gerard just more cautious than normal . Yes ... ? I have to give the country and nationality end , I promise . Do not worry . You need to rest . Good ... ? - I have to go now . - Do not go . Right back . You 're safe here . It 's okay . Wants to close . Lance , should be quarantined . I have to side at this stage THII . The form accelerated growth . Without functional equipment , I can not diagnose correctly . - You guys have done that ... ? - Oh , come on , man ... Six months pregnant in 24 hours , you let me ? Has a reaction to chemical exposure . Must have access to treat . Goes to isolation . Do not risk safety stations . You can not close , dom ' colonel . Requires constant medical supervision . E infection , according to the protocol enters 48 hours in isolation under surveillance . What if he dies there ? You will have access surveillance . But that hatch remains closed . I Access denied . Colonel protocol is unacceptable . Must have access to Ava 24 / 7 . Colonel , can you hear me ? 'm Just worried for Cameron as you . But as commander , are bound by regulation . Remain in isolation . You will have access to it when needed , just give me the news story . Well how about now ? Well not a doctor , but according and they have your is already in the last quarter , when the child organs are almost fully developed ? How to be ? Rational diagnosis is that it would be a kind of cyst . But even so , an accelerated cancer imitating pregnancy is exaggerated . But if spores that have infected her in any way ? When we were in shit up to his neck . Ava ! - Jesus ... - I touch ! Dies , brother ... Cameron , come on . Ava , wake up ! Come hear me ? What the hell is all this ? Dom ' Colonel , I need light ! Return get your Bruce , illuminated here . - What happened ? - Come out at what caused the swelling . Got internal bleeding , methylergometrine on the top shelf . - Gentlemen , you must leave . - Die if we do something ! - Is now officially in the quarantine room ! - Can not you close here ! - Reach out . Ava , let me help you . - I never leave here . Why do you want me lock ? What 's wrong with you ? Go on , Bruce . I stop the bleeding . Colonel , you do not have jurisdiction here , I am Dr. stations . Infirmary is yours . Report to me when you 're done . You have to pay your me , bastard ! Bastards ! E infection , Now you could be and you ! And risked his life for us , so - I thank you ? Focus on communication equipment repair , basis will tell you what to do with it . Until then , follow my orders ! Sure ... Sure ! So right ? I 'm afraid it took less everybody claustrophobia . Perhaps from carbon monoxide intoxication . " El Capitan " closure ordered Ava and I. .. Maybe spores that infected a created ... you some weird stuff . And I still need to figure out what . Heater is off by seven hours . Began to feel the thrill . But ... Back to work . Chief engineer Bruce Johns , ARK monthly basis . Ava , do you ? Ava ! Ava ! Ava ! Ava ! - Go ahead ! - Calm down . S stretches her bed . - Ava , calm down . - Hold it ! - What the hell happened to you ? - Calm down ! Johns , we need your help ! - I was bitten ! - What the hell are you talking about ? - I was bitten ... - Okay , ready ... There was something here ! There was something here .

No , listen . There was something here . Right there . I swear . Take a look ! Come on , forget it ! Close my room . Let me know when you 're done here . Consulted him on it and has the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning . There was something on me . I felt weight on his chest , right ? Thing , this creature , feed my bosom . Was not real . Nothing , Ava . There 's nothing here . You understand ? You had hallucinations . A and A. Go to sleep again . Need to look at the cut of Bruce . Be right back . Bruce , come into the dining room to see your cuts . I know that was something here , with me . I know and you 've seen . Is possible for me to have given birth to something ? Not know .

Listen , I swear I saw something there . You hear stuff ? - Do not believe me ... - No , you and Ava have the same symptoms . Yeah , well ... If something used Ava to reproduce ? A creature that has no DNA . - And I 'll endeavors to enhance the mind ? - Come on , unaware that it is possible . Only when you have the opportunity to examine the fluid Ava will be able to determine precisely . But until then , the most logical and rational rash remains a fibroid . There was nothing in that room which to prove otherwise . Now ... I want to go get some rest , and That 's an order . Yes , Colonel wants to communicate again . MA ask me , we are already in hell . Antenna and destroyed . What ... What the ... Shit ! Johns , working on solar panels ? We need power . Come , come ... O ... So , to straighten them ... Come on ... ! I Calibrating solar panel 's EC ª A manual like ... I manual calibration ON solar panel Good ... Look ! Restoring communications , we see get off this rock . I just said that Johns antenna and destroyed . How 's , is apt debt ? I need it . Worries me , showing signs of paranoia . He has hallucinations . - Bea ... ? - Like crazy . But clearly suffering from exposure to chemicals , and I do not treat it properly . Let alone put them proper diagnosis . It seems it 's just me , dom ' doctor , right ? Yet . Not crazy ... Not crazy ! Not crazy , not Inne ... Not crazy ... ! Johns ! Johns ! Johns . Listen , Johns reach . I want on the treadmill until get your alcohol out of the body and then treat yourself carbon monoxide intoxication . This stops now , right ? Hai , I want functional again . Yo , be ... I knew it ! What ... ? - What are you doing ? - I want to see your finger . What the ... ? You came into direct contact with spores that . Why did not you report this , you know the rules . Yes , because you 're only THII rules , not dom ' Colonel ? - We have rules for a reason specifically . - " Normal " ... ?

Cameron , Dr. Krauss tighten up and realizes what the hell is wrong with you , are forced pertain to you under observation . You mean I closed If you give me way , all put lives in danger . You know I do not give in to threats . You will arrive at the court martial after that . I know I saw something , was not a nightmare . - Cameron ... - If not let me go , - ... all put lives in danger ! - Cameron ! There 's nothing there , suffering from exposure , have to put you in isolation . Come back ! Let go of me ! - Colonel ! - Bastards ... Let me see . - Let 's check it out . - Da ...

And Ava we need to help us . Ava ... Bruce is dead . How do you know that ? Making sense . Ava , we need your help . You could be the only one who can control . And I do not now . Mo used to be is born , but now are a threat to him , and as you . Suppose took a sample of his DNA to Bruce when bitten . And I realized that a male is stronger physically , so in one copy , to survive . But we still need your help . Can we trust you ? You can trust me . Here ARK monthly basis , log entry 184 . We have evidence of alien life forms . A used lt 's body . Cameron as host and now turned into a life form resistance . Looks damn decided to kill us . Took human form should be easier to find . Something is not right . Offer compressor pumps . We cut the oxygen reserves . A disused chimney three . Trying to destroy the system . It makes no sense , if dropped Statham will die with us . He knows , by Bruce , Where escape capsule . I will try to override the system . See if it can find ! Go with you . Cad compressors ! Gimme lamp . - Cut hose ! - You can make a derivation ? - How 's that ? - Baga oxygen . Come quickly , come ! - What are you doing ? - I know they were trying to kill him . Ava ... Position us know by me . - Damn it , Cameron , stay with us ! - Ava , come back ! Bitch ... - Ava ! - Wait . I Danger ! Locks open . Fault system . Take the Ava safe . I close my shield ! This is crazy ! We can not override hatch here ! I Danger ! Locks open . Fault system . I Danger ! Locks open . Fault system . Give me your hand ! overridden system . No ! I block system . Evacuation begins in 30 seconds . Damn ! I block system . Access denied . Get me out of here ! Must have an open soon ! - Do not go . - Try again . I Ten , nine ... I Eight , seven ... I Six , five ... = = I four ... I Three ... I Two ... I One . It returns ... - I can not stop ! - Bruce to go to his cabin . Can discovered something about him that would help us . Come on ! Come motion ! Christ ... I fuck me ... I 'm not crazy has several entries in the log . I thing , who grew up in Ava ... I I crew could reveal that I was infected , because ... = = I can not risk putting me in solitary . I know what I must do , cloned himself in me . 's me one to copy . I am afraid of what may become afterward . I What a be its original form . I can ... Maybe it developing in form human would be killed easily . I 'm thinking to carbon monoxide . When I watch it now , I only way to survive is to Get out the escape capsule . - How long does it take to preparing your dish ? - Too much . Unless ... Sacrifice the whole station to all the energy directed toward launch . To do . If you start it , there 's no place 's back . We have one chance . Then take advantage of it . We need this capsule prepared for the final ascent . There is an emergency contact in the roof span . It engages . Coming in here . Ava ! O can do . A and A. .. Let 's see what we have here . Am diverted supply pipes . I Turn everything when you 're ready . 'm on my way . It returns ... - It 's okay , it 's me . - I do not see anything . - Thou hast prepared ? - Cells will be at 80 % when we arrive . Okay , let 's go . - I have not flashlight . - Together , come on . I hazard . Carbon monoxide , Level 4 and rising . I hazard . Oxygen low . E monoxide . No sense we fish poisoning everybody . Try what he said to Bruce 's get them to kill us . Opened lock span two . Go to capsule and starts the launch sequence . Go ! No need to stay together . Can not coordinate release unless you 're there . Go ! Go ! I hazard . Oxygen low . I hazard . Carbon monoxide , Level 2 and rising . bitch ! Look-a and a .. I launch sequence , turned on . Ava ! We started launching . Enter get your code ! Ava copy ? Ava ! I carbon monoxide , in Level 3 . I launch in three minutes . We are the 80 % . Gerard , descends once . I hazard . Oxygen low . Gerard ! It is here in the bay Release ! launch in two minutes . Gerard ! Breathe ! Come ! I launch into a minute . bastards ! Is blocked . I can override it . Need to stop the launch . Opening ! I launch in 30 seconds . Get in there ! I All schemes prepared . Launch , start . - Close roof capsule . - That 's what I try to do . I ... nine , eight ... I ... Seven , six , five ... I ... Four , three , two ... I One . Release . Fuck ! I 've done . All-units were empty . View in tanks emergency . Oxygen available for 17 minutes . We have 17 minutes . To be true ... ? Here colonel Brauchman . I have an urgent message . I have lost contact with the base on Earth . I have a message for Captain Madsen emergency . Is an emergency broadcast , are Brauchman colonel . Answer ! - ' s Beacon rescue shuttle . - God , how timely ! Aselenizeazã . - Do you think you will arrive on time ? - Fifty-fifty . Or sit here and pray to God to reach us ... Or ... 've got three minutes until landing dock . Can you hold your breath three minutes and a half to run ? Da ... Tail , wait . Cap , we run overkill . Fuck ... Come on ! Still no communication from monthly basis . We only beacon pod . Hatch must be open at impact . No sign of life . Na exited anyone here , I see traces . Escape pods have to be docked from now . Let 's hope we find some answers . Until then , keep quiet . - You called the Task Force ? - I 'll be here in ten minutes . Crows capsule basic coverage . Breathing thing , get on all networks . Isolated area , and enter nobody gets out . Sir , I think it would be to see this . Base , this colonel Brauchman , reporting the USS Magellan spacecraft . I Madsen , any out of that pod , kill him . Do not benevolent killed by Krauss and the Johns . I is clearly a threat to humanity . Translation : FROM Romanian Utilizator by . Matrixz

I remember reading about a scientist . He had a thing for cats and boxes . What he 'd do is take a cat and lock it in a box . And then , just to make things interesting , he 'd also put this machine in there that released poison gas . Now , the scientist didn 't actually know when the machine would release the poison and when it wouldn 't . The only way he could tell for sure was to look inside the box . Here 's the science bit . Until he opened it up , he figured the cat had to be alive and dead . See , if either one was possible , then both had to be possible , too . Ever since I read about that cat , I can 't get the story out of my head . Don 't get me wrong , I don 't give a fuck about the plight of small , furry animals . I just don 't understand .

( GROWLING ) ( ALL SCREAM ) Geoff , what in the hell is going on out there ? They 're people ? Mutated people . With high enough doses of radiation they should all be dead . I 'd say they ought to be dead . Looking pretty dead now . You idiot . The radiation should have killed them , not the bullets . Yeah , it should have , but it didn 't . Geoff , sitrep . ( STAMMERING ) It 's not safe here . We should just go back home . No one said it was going to be safe , Xeni . Are you un-volunteering ? No . No , no , no , sir .

NICOLE : Oh , Mel , why are the only men in my life either brainless ogres or emotional imps ? Ten years in that silo , the pickings are slim . I guess a decade of my dirty laundry being aired doesn 't help . In a space that cramped , there are no closets to hide skeletons . I mean , everybody knows everybody 's business . Look at poor Rogan and Shaina . NICOLE : Yeah , I know . And your brother 's heart is in the right place , but he just has to accept that I 'm with Tyler now . Have you ? GEOFF : ( OVER RADIO ) Missy , I really think we need to address this radiation issue . What 's on your mind , G ? With the sun down , radiation levels have spiked . We either need to find shelter or some iodine pills . Yeah , that 's a great idea , but we ran out of those eight years ago . Maybe if someone 's family hadn 't left our radiation meds behind . Oh , so now you want to blame my mother . Enough of this . Enough of that . We 'll be at the old Franklin junkyard by sunup . GEOFF : Barometric pressure is plummeting . We 've got a storm coming in . MADS : Stay sharp . Good hunting . We 're gonna need those medical supplies . GEOFF : Roger that . MELISSA : Let 's go . Ty , you don 't have to go in , you know . Why wouldn 't I ? This is my home . No , it 's not . Not anymore . It 's okay , hon . I 'm gonna be fine . O Kay ! Tyler knows this place better than any of us , so he 's leading Team One with Nicole . Nicole , tell us what we 're after . Iodine in any form , ideally as tablets or pills , but we 'll take whatever we can find , wherever we can find it . Refrigerators can survive a nuclear blast , so my father had dozens of reserve medical stashes in household appliances , even microwaves and washing machines , all over this place . Well , a bunch of them are bound to have been raided already , so let 's find the ones that haven 't been . The Franklins were ... Are a very crafty family . Geoff , you 're with me .

( GLASS SHATTERS ) ROGAN : Come here , you ! I have had just about enough of this . Any of you ugly bastards move , and I 'll ... FRANCOIS : Well , well . You are certainly prettier than most mutants . The name 's Francois . The pleasure is all mine . You 're human . Hmm . You 're all human . Human . Human enough to know a pretty lady pointing a loaded 12-gauge at my face . Wow . I haven 't seen the end of either one of those in years . Well , if you 're going to be civilized , then I can stop showing you this end . Would you like that ? ( RADIO STATIC ) GEOFF : Situation report . ( ALL GAS P ) That 's just my radio . I have to let my friends know not to shoot you , so I 'm gonna do that , okay ? Stand down . They 're friendlies . That 's not how I remember friendlies . ( SIGHS ) Well , it has been ten years . Friendlies , huh ? Huh ? MELISSA : Humans , at least . They have survived an apocalyptic meteor strike , mutant attacks , food shortages , and God knows what else . It 's cost us too much already to turn back now . The folks back at base are running out of power fast , and then they 're as good as dead . They are counting on us for a solution . MELISSA : And I am on it . Lower your weapon . Now . Well met , new friends . " Well met , " he says ? It is not about how a meeting begins . It 's about how it ends . That 's easy for you to say . Yours didn 't begin with an arrow in the leg . MELISSA : The deputy and his friends have ... Posse . The deputy and his posse are from a nearby town , and they 've offered us asylum . We have walls to protect you from the mutants . We got diesel to trade . We got a doctor to look at your knee . Geoff , is it ? These damn townies shot me . They should be the ones to fix me . Francois got here in a day on foot . If we all pile into Uma , I can get you there by sunset . FRANCOIS : Uma ? ( PEOPLE GASPING ) Uma .

I 'm told you have diesel to trade . ( CHUCKLING ) Well , yes , yes , we do , but first things first ... MELISSA : No , well , for me , diesel is the first thing . Okay . ( MUTANTS SNARLING ) AUTOMATED VOICE : Warning . Perimeter breach . ( BEEPING RAPIDLY ) Mads ! AUTOMATED VOICE : Intruder alert . Mads ! Mutants . If they breach , we got trouble .

( SCREAMING ) Geoff , darling , are you awake ? Can you hear me ? ( INHALES DEEPLY ) ( GROANING ) Oh , don 't try and move . You 're tore up pretty bad in the knee . Bey ? Bev , is that you ? Sure as the day is long , sunshine . ( EXHALES ) When the meteor hit , it wrought havoc across the land . Most of us took refuge in basements and such . The impact was destructive , to be sure , but the fires that came afterwards , the looting , and then , of course , came the mutants . MELISSA : The mutants . What about them ? Well , you know , some say that the mutants rode on the back of the meteor as though it were a fiery stallion . And others say that the meteor infected our planet with evil . Still others , they say the mutants rose up from hell from where the ground broke open . Right . So which is it ? I believe they are a danger , and I believe that when we have wiped out that danger , the good Lord will allow us to multiply once again . Multiply ? SHERIFF ELMORE : Procreate . My dearly departed daughter and Francois here had been trying to make me a grandchild for years . When they 'd finally given up , the Lord saw fit to take her from me . It seems truly impossible . Hold on , no one 's ever gotten pregnant here ? Not a single birth in a decade , not since the mutant scourge fell upon us . It 's not just us . But now , to be blessed by new saviors . Miss , you are truly heaven-sent to bring us such a gift . My God , look at those firearms . Surely , tonight we can rest easy . Indeed . Our guests are here for trade , but they are welcome to stay as long as they like . Although , today will soon be lost , and the night belongs to the mutants . Francois , ready the gates for nightfall . How many arrows did we lose ? We reclaimed three dozen of them for reuse in the morning . Reuse ? Defend your town with a bunch of bows and recycled arrows ? Well , it 's all we have . We 're not so fortunate as you . Mel , do you think we should ... How about this , Elmore ? Since we are here for trade , I 'll give you two of my best shots on guard duty tonight in exchange for diesel , all the diesel that we can carry . Done . Shaina , Rogan , take the nest . ( GROWLING ) ROGAN : What do you think , babe ? What , about the old coot ? No , about what he said . About a curse not letting us have a baby ? Well , little lady , I think he called it a scourge . We 've just spent a decade surviving the biggest natural disaster this world has seen since the dawn of man thanks to science . So , I have a hard time blaming a supernatural scourge for not getting pregnant . Ah . Still , there 's hope . Right ? You always give me hope , my love . ( CHUCKLING ) Always . Now , let 's go wipe out some scourge , sweet cheeks . Aye , aye , little lady . Ooh ! Your sister told me about all your harrowing adventures . Seems you 're quite a hero . Yeah , I , uh ... I took an arrow in the knee . ( GUNSHOT ) Oh ! That one had chicken feet . ( CHUCKLES ) Did you hear that ? ( GUNSHOT ) Shh . ( MUTANT GROWLING ) They 're crack shots , both of them . I said they 're my best . The people of Asylum are in your debt . Deeply , and I have some thirsty diesel engines that would like to see that debt settled soon , Elmore . ( GROWLING ) ( GEOFF GASPS ) Geoffrey , I 've been dreaming of this moment for almost a decade . Oh , me too . Oh , me too . ( MOANING ) ( GROWLING ) ( WHOOPING ) Did you see that head go ? ( LAUGHS ) Try to keep up there , sunshine . I 'm just trying to make you look good for the peanut gallery . ( GROANING ) ( GROWLING ) ( SCREAMING ) Rogan ! Rogan ! ( GROWLING ) Xeni ! ( SOBBING ) No ! God ! The mutants are in . ( GROWLING ) ( SCREAMING ) Did you hear that ? ( SNARLING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( BONE CRUNCHING ) It 's not the mutants . It 's the townies . ( GROWLING ) Shaina ! I need cover fire ! ( SOBBING ) Shaina ! ( SNARLING ) ( GUNSHOTS ) ( SOBBING ) ( SCREAMING ) Oh ! ( GROANING ) ( GROANS ) ( SNARLING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) ( ENGINE REVVING ) Follow me . Barricade the door now ! What the hell happened out there ? I could ask the same thing , except I think that you know more than any of us . Mutants . ( SNARLING ) ( GURGLING ) Like I said , mutants . No , her radiation exposure is not like the other mutants we 've encountered . Sure , Bev should be riddled with cancer , but it 's not lethal radiation poisoning . Who the hell is this ? Who the hell are you ? Preacher . MELISSA : Preacher . Well , Preacher , do you mind explaining what just happened here ? Same radiation , just less of it . Makes ' em plenty a mutant at night . And seeing as it 's night at the moment , I 'd say my initial statement holds true . Mutants . So they 'll be fine in the morning ? All except those with no heads or hearts , and just while the sun 's up . Then , it 's this again . So different degrees of exposure makes different degrees of mutation . Brainy boy 's got the notion . That meteor hit a nuclear reactor , and everything in the blast got changed . Anything a little bit deep got a bit less changed . All right . But you still haven 't told us what you 're doing here . I 've been tracking your asses since you left the bunker . Figured you were on your way to Haven . Then you came here instead . I knew the surprise you 'd be in for . Thought I 'd lend a hand . Haven . That 's another town ? Not just a town . Haven . The name 's perfect . No radiation , no mutants , no pirates , no looting . Just west of the mountains . Enough palaver . My throat 's drying out . ( MUTANTS CONTINUE GROWLING ) It 's been a while since I had a flock to watch over . I can do it from here tonight . Hey , Preacher . In case you need it . ( STATIC BUZZING ) My name is Melissa . Melissa . How you holding up , G ? I was told what 's left of me is in excellent condition . That 's funny , except your best critic just lost her voice . GEOFF : Yeah . ( MUTANTS SNARLING ) A King never breaks , right ? That 's right . ( METAL WHIP CLATTERING ) I don 't buy it . She 's not making any sense . Come on , G. You 've got to relax . If the meteor hit the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor , that 's a global catastrophe . So Haven isn 't real ? She 's never been there . If she has , why leave Haven ? ( sum-nus ) Well , we left ours . Now we have to go back . To the silo ? No . We have no choice . He needs antibiotics . Your fella need ' cillin ? 'Cillin ? Yeah , for the leg . Before the rot sets in and it 's got to be cut off . 'Cillin ... Penicillin , yeah . Yeah , he needs antibiotics . For my brother , not my fella . No offense intended . Didn 't ken the resemblance . You 're a mite prettier . Well , ugly as he is , my brother needs antibiotics fast . Might be I got some , if you have something to offer . What do you need ? ( SNARLING ) Your help . I 'm listening . ( SNARLS ) ( GRUNTS ) That 's not how I was counting on you using your shotgun , Melissa . This lady here ain 't got your range . I 'm not murdering anyone who 's going to be human again when the sun comes up . Can 't this wait until morning ? You mustn 't ever hold back , Melissa , not ever . Holding back 's for the weak . You may as well be inviting death . ( sums ) These townies are infected , beyond redemption . They 're as good as dead already . So every time you put one down , it 's a mercy .

Yeah , I love singing . I sang in the church choir , but my dad always liked me to have shooting lessons instead of singing lessons . Wouldn 't need lessons in either , in my opinion . Who are you , really ? ( sums ) I ain 't no preacher . Just a woman trying to get past the waste , trying to get to Haven . Dressed like a priest ? I found these clothes looting the stores years ago . I never meant to be an imposter or a heretic . It 's just that people on the road treated me different when I wore this . They respected me , listened to me . They followed me , like I was garbed in hope itself . Until I led my people to this hellhole . I lost my whole damn flock the first night those monsters turned on us . I couldn 't bear to let that happen to yours , so I came back for y 'all . You can 't be hard all the time .

Then she went right to the surface , to the waste , to find more survivors . She wanted to save them . I 'd say she succeeded . I couldn 't help her . I was useless . I was numb . I was feverish .

 I always get the shakes before a drop . I had the injections . Hypnotic prep . The Federation shrink scanned my brainwaves . Everything checked out . Doc says it wasn 't fear . I could 've told him that . A horse locked in the starting gate isn 't afraid . He 's just ready to run . A-Team . Our mission is to seize and control the B-Dock area , clear away the bugs , and evac the survivors . Now , once we land , we join forces with the K-12 team at the fort. lt 's a standard grab and go . After the rescue , we return to the ship , take off , then we blow the fort and the bugs . Are we clear ? Loud and clear , sir ! Go , go , go ! Report . Pretty bad . Some of our men are in the far corridor . Let 's get them out of there . Mech , we 're done here . Prep to blow . - Sir . Holyman and Chow , on the cover . Biggers and Crysoch hold position . The rest of you , follow me . We 're on a rescue mission , people ! Lieutenant Daugherty . What is your status ? Too many bugs . No way to take back Fort Casey . Will hold till the john A. warden evacuates . Alesia will stand by for immediate evac . Keep me posted . Roger that . Mech ! What 's your ETR ? Almost there , sir . Done . Let 's go . Charleston 's down ! Medic ! - I 'm on it . Have you completed loading the crates ? No . That is your priority . Hm . What the hell is this about , Carl ? Wonderful to see you again , Carmen . You commandeered my damn ship . Borrowing it. I 'll give it back . You 're never gonna take the john A. warden from me . Guards , I believe Captain Ibanez needs an escort to the Alesia . What do you want with my ship , Carl ? Tsk , tsk , tsk . Carmen , that 's classified . But I can tell you this . This mission ... Oh , this mission will turn the tide . You always were such an asshole . And I was always so fond of you as well , Carmen . See you on Terra . Friends always , right ? A-Team , reload . This is A-Team leader to Fort Casey . Evacs , come in . About goddamn time . It 's a little crowded out here . Exit now . Dock B. On our way . Show some hustle . It 's quiet now , but that ain 't gonna last . Evacs coming out . Keep your eyes open and your heads down ! I don 't wanna lose anyone to friendly fire ! Who 's in charge ? Acting commander , sir . Major Henry Varro has been relieved of duty . Relieved ? What the hell happened ? This was a suicide mission from the get-go , fucking head case . Shut your mouth , Ratzass . You wanna be busted like Hero ? We 're out of here ! Let 's get back to the ship . Mech ! How 's it coming with that charge ? Armed and dangerous . You have to be kidding me . Thanks for waiting , jackass ! Command ! If there are new orders , let me know , goddamn it ! Are we gonna escort the john A. warden or not ? Behind us ! Sir ! This is Biggers ! Can 't hold any more ! We 're ... Aah ! You bug sons of bitches ! Aah ! Captain jonah , This is A-Team . Landing ship destroyed . Boarding directly now . Roger that . As soon as you 're aboard , Alesia will depart . Wedge formation ! Fall back into the Alesia ! Hold formation . Hold formation . My arm ! My goddamn arm ! Medic ! Four-twenty-four , 425 , 426 . Return to the ship ! Four-twenty-eight , 429 , 430 , 431 . Trig ! Move your goddamn ass . We 're taking off . Come on ! Jump ! Thanks . Anytime . Score ? - Four-thirty . Give or take . You gonna do it or what ? Hit it , maestro . Three , two , one , boom . Oh , come on , guys . This shit ain 't over yet . Ha-ha-ha . Yeah . All right . So , what the hell happened to you guys down there ? We were right on top of a motherfucking ant hill . Varro saved our ass . Then that ESP prick , Jenkins , sent us on a death run . Straight into a goddamn hive . But you didn 't hear that shit from me . Uh , I 'm sorry , you say something ? Attention ! You can all be proud of yourselves . We saved some lives . And we killed some bugs . But we lost some good troopers today . Here 's to the dead . And to the next man to die ! Now let 's get back to Terra . And we can put some real glasses in these hands . Heh . Check it out . What 's the matter ? You never saw a flanker without her armor before ? Yeah . But they usually look like Ratzass . Ratzass ? Heh . That 's what they call me . Because you don 't give a rat 's ass about anything . What a surprise . Hey , you want me to show you to the shower ? I could wash your back . You don 't wanna wash my front ? Hm . Shh . Shut up . Captain on the bridge . Stand down . This is your ship , not mine , captain . Simple respect , Captain Ibanez . For what happened on Planet-P Venta Monis alone . If only more strikes were executed that way . I had a good team . What can you tell me ? About ? Where 's my ship ? And why does Jenkins want it so badly ? Believe me , if I could provide you with any information ... This ship is in pursuit of the john A. warden , isn 't it ? I understand your concern for the john A. Warden , Captain Ibanez , but this is the Alesia and we command it . Our orders are to return to Terra . Then show me the data on the john A. warden 's path . Where 's she headed ? We don 't know , captain . We lost her signal shortly after we began pursuit . Please contact me when you find the john A. warden . Aye , aye , captain . Hey , man . Don 't write this up , okay ? This is a serious wound . Could 've been a lot worse . I can 't keep something like this off the record. I ... I 'm gonna have to take your arm . Fine . But , look , at least do what you can to make sure it doesn 't get back to my folks . You can at least do that , right , doc ? Let 's do this . Um , why don 't we wait till the shaking stops ? The ship will be fine . I 'm not talking about the ship . Oh . Hey , newb . Dance class is down the hall . No . It 's right here . Care to dance ? Heh . This ring is for fighting . Humor me . What 's your name ? Chow . Well , Chow , I don 't usually dance with guys , but in your case , heh , I 'll make an exception . Who 's your money on ? Ratzass is bigger . Not much upstairs ... Whatever , dude . Ratzass gets in one good solid hit and Chow 's going down . Shit , if he can ever land a punch . Chow 's fast , man . All right , fighters , to your corners . You back out now , I won 't think any less of you . When I ring the bell , come out fighting . They 're gonna miss you when you 're gone . Hm . Aw ... Good thing there 's not much upstairs . Don 't have to worry about brain damage . Hey , damage this . Hey . Did you see that ? Didn 't know you had it in you . Flash of inspiration . Unh . E057 , E057 . E057 . Thanks , I really appreciate ... it . Hm . They can 't get me a bed till tomorrow . Thanks for letting me use the com ... ? Tia . Tia Durer . Trig is fine . Otis Hacks . Bugspray . Hey , uh ... Thanks for the catch . At Fort Casey . Sleeping with a gun ? You must know something I don 't . Morita XXX sniper rifle . Classic . Hm . You 've got a nice smile for a psych job . Thanks ... I think . So up for a little training ? I think I 've had about all the target practice I can stand today . Yeah . I was thinking about something a little more strenuous . You didn 't really use the intercom , did you ? Would you like to know more ? Heh . Oh . Everyone 's doing their part . Major Henry Varro . One of the most decorated officers in the Federation . You 've run long-range ops in places even God 's given up on . What did you do ? Why won 't you talk ? And why won 't your men talk ? Heh . There are modifications you can score on the black market when you get to Terra . But as far as what the Federation will pay for , it 's still a good prosthetic . Got it . Nice job . Don 't know what you were nervous about . I bet this looks as good as all the others . What others ? You 're my first . Matter of fact , you 're the first guy I 've worked on that 's actually lived . Every commander I 've ever served under tries to get me to use a regulation gun . That is , until they see how many I kill with that one . Then they don 't ask me anymore . My parents made that rifle . There was an armory in my home town . Everyone worked there . That is , until the bugs melted the place with a plasma bomb . Soldiers , civilians , families . Everyone died . I swore then that I 'd kill just as many bugs . And I 'd do it with that gun . That 's why you count ? No . That 's why it counts . Goddamn you , Carl . Where 'd you learn that haymaker ? Dance class . Shit. I knew it . I just felt it . We aren 't gonna see Terra any time soon . Aw , you 're a pessimist . Specialist , actually . Well , almost . Five points short on the ESP test . If one more jack had been a diamond , I wouldn 't be here with you dumbasses . You son of a bitch . That 's how you always know when I 'm in the shower . So can you tell what I 'm thinking now ? Hell , even I know what you 're thinking now . You make me sick . Hm . What 's up , Lieutenant Daugherty ? I thought you were in Medical . Ah , wasn 't as bad as it looked . Ah . Glad you two could make it . Ow ! - Whoo ! At ease . I wanted to brief you all personally , first and foremost because I know the sacrifices that both the crew of the Alesia as well as the defenders of Fort Casey have made ... and the great losses that you 've suffered . And second , I know you could all use some RR about now . Believe me , I 've been there myself . But , unfortunately , we have a situation . What ? Stow it . The John A. Warden has gone silent . The Alesia is the only starship in the area of last contact . I have ordered your captain to divert course , find the warden , and investigate . Any questions ? Yeah . I speak for everyone from Fort Casey when I say this . Shut the fuck up . it 's okay . Go on . We 're only going in if Hero takes point . Hero ? Major Henry Varro , Commander of Fort Casey , General Rico . Right . Arrested by Dr. Carl jenkins for insubordination at the battle of Fort Casey . Fine. lf Major varro chooses to participate in this mission , the mobile infantry will accept his service . However , this will not , in any way be prejudicial to his trial , is that understood ? Understood , sir . We 'll probably lose communications as you cross the nebula . Godspeed , Alesia . Dismissed . Assemble in the staging area . A word , Captain ibanez . Why did you let him take my ship ? Carmen , it 's not your ship . It belongs to the Terran Federation . General Rico , perhaps you recall there was a certain young trooper who was with me when the Roger Young went down . I vowed that would never happen to a ship under my command . This is not my choice . I mean , look , I don 't care what you thought of Carl back when we knew him and I don 't care what you think now . He 's minister of Paranormal warfare and high command has authorized him to use the John A. Warden . Look , Carmen , this is a mission that 's so classified , I don 't even know what ... Look how well it 's going . You know the John A. Warden like the back of your hand . I need you to go aboard with the insertion team . I looked at the manifest . That ship didn 't just go dark . Her signal was turned off . And you know as well as I do , the only one ... who has the gall to run a Federation starship dark is Carl Jenkins . And how do you know we 're even close to my ship ? Before we lost contact , we analyzed some of the scattered signals . Calculating course and speed , we were able to get a good estimate of its location . Now , it 's not spot on , but we can get you pretty damn close . Fine . I 'll do it . But not to save Carl 's sorry ass . I 'll do it to take back my ship . You just be careful . We need you back intact when this thing is over . Thank you , Johnny . Hey , Carmen , when this thing is over , maybe you and I can meet at zim 's and , uh ... Uh ... Yeah . Yeah . Sheesh . I gotta tell you . This will in no way be prejudicial to your trial . Aw , come on . I didn 't have anything to do with any of this . I 'm just the damn janitor trying to clean it up . Look , major , I 'm no more enthusiastic about saving Carl Jenkins than you are . But your men want you . And something tells me we 're gonna need you . Hm . Lieutenant Daugherty , we 've found the John A. Warden . Tell Captain Jonah to move to standoff range . I 'll be right up . So which is it ? Get these chains off me . it 'd be too bad if a stray shot hit Jenkins . I know you 're pissed but don 't think shit like that . They threw Hero into the brig . You or me , Hoiyman or Kharon , what do you think they 'd do to grunts like us ? They 'd shove us out of a goddamn airlock . So I gotta watch my ass ? Yeah . But if you 're not gonna do that , at least watch mine . Oh . Oh , man , fuck you . Can 't believe I 'm the only one not getting laid around here . Looks like you 've got your bases covered . Tell me , Holyman , which one 's gonna save you today ? I can take care of myself . Women , they make the highs higher and the lows more frequent . Are atheists the only philosophers you can quote ? I find that believers such as you say so few things worth writing down . And I 've found that he who looks so forward to the abyss is simply afraid of the light . Hm . I 'm gonna go get you a pen . Wait , did you just make that up ? No , no , I 'm not writing that down . john A. warden , this is the Alesia , please respond . I 've tried everything . Voice , radio flash , even light code . Nothing . Keep trying , lieutenant . - Zoom in on the bridge . Maybe they can 't hear us . They 'd have to know what our objective is . Bridge , this is your captain . Respond now . if you do not respond , we will board . Board it . That 's not my ship anymore . Kids ? Husband ? Died on Planet 4976 . Hey , the way I figure it , the bug 's got more reason to be scared than I do . I 've killed hundreds of them , they killed zero of me . Uh ... Oh , man . Listen . I want you to do me a favor . Yeah ? if I don 't make it , I don 't care what happens to my body . But try to get my rifle scope , will you ? And have it buried in my home town . Look , I don 't like funerals . Do me a favor . Don 't get killed . Heh . Okay , boys and girls . Looks like this is gonna be my last mission . So let 's make it a good one . Our job is to retake the john A. Warden , rescue any and all survivors and exterminate any resistance we might find . You got that ? Sir , yes , sir ! All right , troopers , let 's get the lady her ship back . Hoo-ah ! lnitiate docking procedure . lnitiating docking procedure . Team one : Lieutenant Daugherty , ice , Trig , Mech , Shock Jock leading Captain Ibanez to the bridge . Team two : Chase , Kharon , Chow , Bugspray , Gunfodder , Ratzass , Holyman , and the rest , you 're coming with me to the engine room . Don 't know what we 're gonna find in there so be ready for anything . Let 's go . Gravity zero , oxygen level yellow , ready to board the John A. Warden . We 're in . Team one moving toward the bridge . Team two boarding . Moving toward the engine room . Something up ahead . No ... Oh , my God . Team two , we 've got bodies near the bridge . We 've got bodies everywhere . Ugh . Man , they 've been bug-ripped . infestation confirmed . Stay sharp , people . Nearing objective . Daugherty to team two , we 're on the bridge . And it ain 't pretty . Got multiple casualties ... and one dead bug . All clear . Shock jock . Massive tearing wounds . Oh , my God . My crew . Bridge is secure . Team two , what 's your status ? Over . Entering engine room now , over . Fucking bloodbath . Team two scout . I 've got dead troopers and bugs . Holy shit . - Amen . Why 'd they all die here ? Focus on the mission , troopers . Chow , prep the engines . Yes , sir . Major , I have a survivor . Well , find him . Chow , what 's the status on that engine ? Give me 10 . - You 've got five . Yes , sir . Team one , engine 's operative in five . That a real five minutes or a " sort of " five minutes ? Over . Hard five . And we 've got a possible survivor . Going to investigate , over . Gunfodder , have team hold position . Bugspray and Ratzass , cover Chow . Like paint , major . Looks like they were trying to make this into a lab . What is that thing ? Holding cell . To keep a bug inside . Now it looks like they 're trying to keep them out and somebody else in . Emergency power supply from Alesia seems to be working . Team one , team two . Gravity restoration in five , four , three , two ... Fuck ! internal Oxygen level is green . I 'd feel a whole lot better if I knew what happened to those bugs . Wouldn 't we all ? Who 's there ? Major Varro . What are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be on trial . Yeah , well , looks like that plan was about as successful as your little experiment here . What happened on this ship , Jenkins ? I hacked her . So she hacked me . She ? What do you mean , " she " ? Worthy opponent . She hacked everything . Me , the ship , everything ! Well , of course she did . She knew what I was thinking . Thoughts become words , words become deeds . We 're gonna get you out . You and I can settle our score later . Open the door , Jenkins . And let you kill me ? No ! Besides. it 's safer in here . Safest place on the ship . Safe place , yes , safe place , my safe house . Open the door , Jenkins . You think it 's funny ? Turning tables , tables turned . I arrested you , now I 'm the one in the cage . You think that 's funny , do you ? ! Do you ? ! I 'll leave your ass here , don 't think I won 't . You figure it out while we clear the ship . Have this door opened by the time we get back . There 's nothing to clear ! The crew 's dead . Everyone 's dead . Darkness , darkness is your friend . Whatever you do , don 't turn on the lights . Let there be light . Yes . Varro to Chow . Do not restart the engines . Varro to Chow , do not restart engines . Do you copy ? Don 't be afraid of the dark . Good job , Chow . Bridge is green . Chase ! Grenade ! Bugs ! We got bugs ! Multipie contacts . Holy shit ! Is that abyss you were talking about ? Engine room under attack ! Take positions . They 're coming . Whoa ! Get back to the airlock . Move and fire ! No ! I 'll draw them off . You go ! Unh ! No , we 're not leaving him . Go . I 'll see you on the other side . Holyman , in formation and fire ! Die , bugs ! You think I give a rat 's ass if I die ? Aah ! This way ! Get to the airlock . Bridge , we 're heading to the airlock . And they are right on our ass . Roger that . Goddamn it . Bug ! Chow ! Run ! Alesia , we are under massive bug attack ! Request immediate evac . Repeat , request immediate evac . Roger that . Alesia is preparing for your retrieval . Let 's go . This is Alesia . Ready for your arrival , over . Unh ! it 's jammed ! Don 't suppose you have a good replacement part to fix this . You 're gonna make it . Oh , that 's right . You can 't let me die . I 'm the only one of your patients that 's lived . Open the airlock . Shock jock , you go first . - Yes , sir . What the heli ? Evasive action . Shock jock ! What the hell just happened ? The Alesia 's gone . Did we just fire on them ? Alesia , Captain Jonah , answer me . Listen up , everybody . We head to the bridge now . Since when is she giving the orders ? Since we boarded her ship . Just asking . Bugs ! I hacked her , so she hacked me . I hacked her , so she hacked me . I hacked her , so she hacked me . I hacked her , so she hacked me. i ... Are you all right , captain ? You know , if I wanted to run this much , I would have joined the mobile infantry . Captain Ibanez to the L-6 Base . High command , this is the john A. warden . Johnny , please respond . Communication is always jaggy near wormholes . Recommend we position ourselves away from the nebula . How did the cannons fire ? And why target our own ship ? Jenkins tried to warn us . Carl is alive ? Locked himself in a bug cage . And you 're just now telling me this ? Look , captain , if you 're ready for a full debriefing , I 'm all for it . Hero . Jenkins found a queen on Fort Casey . He ordered us to capture it alive . What the ... ? Tell her the rest , major . Yes , major . Tell me the rest of it . I knew trying to take the queen would result in heavy casualties . I wasn 't gonna sacrifice my men for a bug hunt . So that 's why he had you arrested . But he got the queen after all . Wait a minute . How the hell can a bug control a starship ? You 're gonna have to ask Jenkins that . What the ... ? We 're moving . Where ? No idea . But if the queen is in control ... Need to stop her from getting there . How ? Back to the engine room . Shut them down . Negative . Not enough soldiers or ammo . What the hell are you doing ? Praying . Well , keep it up . We 're gonna need all the help we can get . Now we 're back in business . Captain , you need to take a look at this . She 's heading straight for the Marjizon wormhole . It 'll take her straight to Earth . This is Captain Ibanez to the L-6 Base . Captain Ibanez calling L-6 Base . This is Captain Ibanez to Johnny Rico . L-6 Base come in . This is Captain lb ... What the heli are you doing ? if she is in the engine room , then I 'm gonna hunt her down . I 'll back you up . No . You stay . Besides , you 'll never be able to fit through here . I 'll be back . You 're not gonna stop her ? She 's a big girl . She knows what she 's doing . Do we ? I bypassed the circuit board . if we can gain control without being detected ... Strap yourselves in . I 'm not gonna sit in that blood seat . Do it . She 's onto us . Damn it . Fire ! General . A Federation starship has just emerged from the Marjizon wormhole . it 's ... It 's the john A. warden . On screen . They 're receiving our signal , sir . Any response ? No , sir , they 're not responding . Something 's wrong . Why would they head back towards Earth ? Sir , if they keep their current trajectory , the john A. warden ... Sir , it 's heading straight for us . John A. Warden . This is General Rico . Come in . john A. Warden , this is the L-6 Base . if you do not change course immediately , we will be forced to engage . Repeat , the L-6 Base will take defensive action if you do not change course . john A. warden , respond . Taik to me , Carmen . Aah ! The L-6 Base . We 've got to warn Johnny . Morse code . We can 't use the beacon . She has control of the ship . Yeah ? She doesn 't have control of this . General . There 's fire on the bridge of the john A. Warden . Get me a closer look at that ship . it 's Morse code . They 're trying to send us a message . Repeat . Bugs in control . How the hell do bugs control a starship ? Goddamn you , Carl . Depioyment status ? Sheridan , Ishizuka , and the Franklin are heading to intercept . The sheridan has taken catastrophic damage . The Franklin is critical but operational . Franklin , disengage . Get clear of the john A. warden . The john A. warden 's approaching , on a crash course . Ready to intercept , sir . Main cannon armed and ready . Carmen ... Carl ... Commander ! Open ... fire ! Fire ! Sir . We can 't fire now . They 're too close . They missed us , sir . Yeah . But why ? Commander , I have the warden 's trajectory . It 's heading straight for the Earth . They never meant to ram us . We were just in their way . This is General Rico to Earth Defense Command . The John A. Warden is under bug control and entering Earth 's atmosphere . it 's what ? The John A. Warden ? Rico , I don 't care if john A. Warden is on that ship himself , if that ship is infested , you take it down . Just give me a chance to do both , sir . Rescue our men and gain control . Rico ... Commander , I promise . A bug invasion will not happen on my watch , sir . it better not . Spaceborne command . Prepare a drop . What now ? Daugherty , you stay here and protect the captain . The rest of you , lock and load . it 's time we exterminate that bitch . Hoo-ah ! She 's trying to crash the ship . Do what you have to do ! I don 't know what to do . Trig , where are you now ? Trig , location ? Trig , come in . Trig , respond . Where are you ? Trig ! Central storage area . Have you found the queen ? Oh , yeah . This bitch is disgusting . Take her out . Done . We 're running out of time . Do you read me ? Loud and clear , captain . Shit . in that case ... That 's it . Oh , shit . Four-thirty-eight , 439 . Four-forty ... Trig ... All hands , prepare for impact . Magnetic stabilizers on . All hands , report . Can anybody hear me ? Hero . Anybody ? Lieutenant . Thank you . Rico , you 're not a trooper anymore . Remember that . I 'm always a trooper . And if there are any of our men alive on that ship , I 'm getting them out . Should 've known you 'd say that . Kill them any way you can . Kill them all . In T-minus 30 , we 'll send nukes to sanitize that site . So be out of there before we hit . Don 't wait for me . if I 'm not out in 30 , nuke it . ice ! Unh ! Holyman ! What the hell kind of bug is that ? Fuck me ! I was just starting to believe you . fall back now ! Troopers . Our mission is to storm the wreck of the john A. Warden , rescue our surviving men and kill every last son-of-a-bitch bug we see . Do you understand ? ALL Yes , sir ! We 've got 25 minutes before they level that site . So move fast . And remember . We 're not fighting for some rock across the galaxy . We 're fighting for our home ! Commence the attack . Over here . This way . Are you all right , captain ? - Yeah . Thanks . Come on . Let 's get to the air lock and get out of here . That voice ... Purging now ! Come on , you apes . You wanna live forever ? Kill them all ! She still has the ship . Ice , you guard the captain . The rest of you are coming with me . We 're gonna kill the queen and take back the ship . Good luck . Don 't worry . You 'll see your kids soon . But those bugs ? We 're taking their mama down . Holy shit ! - Take evasive action ! incoming . Run and gun ! Listen . It 's the engine . Mech , still have explosives ? Some C4 . Trig . No . Trig . Trig ! No . Ambush . Go , sir . I 'll hold them off for as long as I can . Four-forty-one , 442 , 443 , 444 . Damn . What the hell ? This is what I 've been working on . T - minus 60 till launch . Starting final countdown . Fifty-six , 55 , 54 , 53 , 52 , 51 ... Carmen , get down ! Johnny ? Are there any other survivors ? - Four more . Heading to kill the queen . And ... Jenkins ? You 're still alive ? I can 't die yet . Not until we win this war at least . So , by controlling the bugs , you ... I can bring us one step closer to winning the war . And I can get you close enough to kill the queen . Then let 's get moving . Let 's negotiate . Daugherty ? Surrender Jenkins to us and we will let you live . They fear me . Maybe they just think you 're an asshole . Fuck off . Then , you die ! These are the last ones I can control directly for now . If I could have finished my research ... Then finish it . So we can end this . Run . What ? I said run ! Three . Two . One . Launch . Four-fifty-four , 455 , 456 , 457 , 458 ... Carl ! Johnny Rico . I should leave your ass here to get nuked . What do you mean " nuked " ? Let 's go . Johnny , the landing ship is here . I 'm coming . We lost contact with the landing ship . T - minus-15 until impact . Where 's the ship ? No . They took out the nuke . She 's won . I still have one . One what ? The shuttle I used to evacuate from Fort Casey . Heh . Then let 's use it . She 'll never let us leave . You son of a bitch . Aw . Now that 's not nice . Tell them . I set explosives on the main engine . What ? Mech , still have explosives ? Some C4 . Good . If we put the C4 in the main engine , we can blow up the ship and the queen with it . Whoa . We might not make it out in time . At least they won 't . Okay . Then do it . Ratzass , watch his back . - Yes , sir . So the extraction team 's been wiped out ? Just 10 minutes left . Johnny , what are you doing ? Get to the shuttle . Johnny ! Let 's go . Follow me . Shit . Unh . Are you Varro ? Yes , sir . Where 's Jenkins ? He 's safe . Varro ! Unh ! Good . Make sure he keeps everybody else that way . He did it . Fifty-nine seconds . Where 's Johnny ? Captain , take us home . Aye , aye , sir . Are you gonna do it or what ? Hm . Three . Two . One , boom . I thought the good guys and the hot girls always survived in the end . No . Not all of them . Here 's to the dead . And to the next man to die . I hope you feel better . Do you realize that you not only destroyed my ship and killed my crew , but you also put the entire planet at risk for infestation . My apologies for your loss . But my research is going to save an entire galaxy . Just like I saved you . It was you . You told me how to find Hero . Well , that 's classified . See , nothing can stop us when the three of us are working together . Are we , Carl ? Pardon ? Are we ? Working together ? Cheer up , Johnny . You 're a hero . No . No , I 'm not . But I met one .

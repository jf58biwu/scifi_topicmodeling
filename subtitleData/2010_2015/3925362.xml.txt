 Previously on Caprica ... Tomas Vergis Has taken my company away from me , And I want it back . The Guatrau is having me Blackmail my Graystone Board of Directors To get my company back . So Terry Albick . I got nothin ' . - He 's sleeping with his sister-in-law . You 'd be surprised what comes out at corporate retreats . I think we can count on his vote . Who 's next ? I tried to help my friend Zoe , But now I 'm in way too deep . I have a small task for you . A small but important task . Clarice ? Sister Clarice ? Yeah . What about her ? I want you to replace the fob on her car keys with this . You put a bomb in her car . No . You did , actually . Let 's see some terror . Oh , my God . After Barnabus attempted murder , He left me no choice But to settle all s.T.O. Business . Others need to be taught The price of disobedience . Are you gonna kill me ? I hope not . Clarice was such a good friend to me , And now I 'm betraying her . These monotheists , they want nothing more Than to have us either convert or destroy us . It 's not the monotheists , it 's the terrorists . Think your friend Clarice willow is one . Why are you telling me this ? Because I need your help . You have intimate access to an s.T.O. Leader . You want me to spy on my friend ? Is that it ? I 'm called a deathwalker Because I can 't die in v-world . I 've seen the symbol around the city . It belongs to the other deathwalker . - She didn 't De-res . - She was shot , but she 's not De-ressing . Any ideas where she is ? I hear you can 't die , But you can bleed , And you can hurt . Look who showed up . Deathwalker ! I 'm looking for the deathwalker . You don 't find the deathwalker . She finds you . Hey , whatever this game is , I 'm not playing it . To enter is a challenge . Rules are rules . Ave , deathwalker ! You fight or die ! Daddy , help ! You ever been shot before ? Really hurts , doesn 't it ? By the way , you found me . You didn 't because you 're useless ! You tried to kill us , But you didn 't because you 're useless ! Worthless ! Did you think we wouldn 't find you ? I don 't even know why Clarice wants you here . Shh . It 's okay . I won 't let the others hurt you . Cyrus , what 's going on ? What is the board doing here ? The chairman has called for an emergency vote . What emergency ? I believe it 's a motion to reinstate Daniel Graystone As the CEO . Hey , Parker , what the frak is going on ? Albick ! Look me in the eye , gods damn it ! Let 's be civil and give them the room . They 'll call when they need you . Shall we ? Daniel ? You have a phone call . Yes , put it through . Daniel ? Yes ? Vote 's in . 14-zip . Congratulations . Thank you . Why did you bring her here ? - Don 't have to answer to you , mar-beth . Of course not . The rules of this marriage don 't apply to you . Be careful what you both say . We don 't need the kids talking . Right . About the teenage girl tied up in the attic ? Speaking of which , are you almost done with lacy ? Almost . Good . Well , I 'm going back to Amanda At the cabin . But why ? Because it is what God wants . Zoe ? Zoe ? You 're back . You 're drawing the fire . Yes , when we first met . Thanks for saving me and being my friend . Welcome back . Wait . Please just listen to me . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . Okay , look , I 've just ... I 've practiced this so many times In my head the last few weeks . I think you and I are the same . People say you 're the other one who can 't be killed . That 's true . I can 't . Yeah , okay , so , look , I think that you and I , we can bring ... So do you remember that Maglev bombing , The one that killed my mother and I ? According to that , you did it . Okay , that . Yes , that ! Yeah ! Help ! Please help ! They 're keeping me prisoner ! Help ! Help ! Why are you doing this ? Help ! Just let me go . Help ! MESSAGE TO Jordan DURAM NOTHING IN CABIN - SENDING MESSAGE FROM Jordan DURAM INFILTRATE HER HOME I 'm gonna miss this place . Yeah , me too . Clarice , Can I come home with you ? Don 't be silly . Anyway , I don 't think my family would like it . Come on . Can 't keep the cabbie waiting . You 're ... You 're drugging me . You motherfrakkers . You 're drugging me ! Want a drink ? No , thank you . I 'm fine . We just didn 't want you to think That the transition 's over . What , you ... You want to take out Vergis ? Has to be done . According to whom , you and Sam or ... You know , the whole point of cooking up the vote Was so that I could get back in somewhat legitimately . And you did , Vergis is Tauron . He 'll never lie down . If allowed to live , he 'll come back . He must be returned to the soil . And then what ? And then his brother comes after you , And Sam goes after him ... Daniel , I think you know where this is coming to . Yeah , with someone dead . Look , let me ... Let me talk to him . Let me try and reason with him . He 's a man of business .. We speak the same language . No . You speak Caprican . Human beings value life . That 's o of the main things that makes us Slightly more evolved than animals , Understanding the value of life . Other things have value . All right , well , look , if I don 't at least try , Then I 'm ... I 'm no better than ... Me ? Him . Hello , Amanda . This is a welcome surprise . Hello , serge . Is Daniel here ? Not at the moment . Would you like me to ping him ? No , that 's all right . Hey , come on . Come on . You gotta eat . You gotta be hungry . Very hungry . But the next time I eat , It 's because Clarice brings me food herself And tells me what she wants . I 'll tell her . Okay , wait , just let me explain . Yes , please explain why you deliberately slaughtered Hundreds of innocent people All for your meaningless fictional God ! You took my life and my mother 's ! That wasn 't me , okay ? She died on that train . It says so right here . Look , I 'm a copy , okay , just like you . You are lying ! I am not a copy ! I have all of my memories , all the feelings I had , And it stands to reason you do too . It 's hard to explain . You know , there were a lot of people in new cap city Who had friends and family on that train . You know that I am not original Zoe . Tell it to them , But I don 't think they care . My father was on that Maglev train . This won 't bring him back . It might feel pretty good , though . Lacy ? Poor thing . It 's gonna be okay . I 'm scared . I need your help , not your fear . Try to get up . Stay down . Say down . If you 're like me , you 'll heal soon enough . So why won 't you fight back ? You don 't know where I 've been lately . I 'm tired of fighting . I 'm not . Maybe you just won 't fight Because you know you deserve this . Is that true ? Is that what you think ? It 's you . I remember you . Hey , dad . Hi , sweetheart . - Can I go snow-ramming With lacy and the guys this weekend ? Sure . Sounds like fun . You know , if we buy a season pass , It actually works out being cheaper . I like the way you 're thinking . You know , that 's like ... I used to draw those . Did you ? Yeah . Well , maybe I saw it And it stuck in my head somewhere , huh ? How close is it to done ? Oh , don 't even ask . I can tell you all about it tomorrow . Oh , I am exhausted . Well , don 't stay up too late , And don 't mess with my settings . Look . Same legs . Brain 's in the chest , not the head . He 's got plenty of time for you When he wants to steal an idea . He 's not stealing anything from me . You know what would infuriate him ? Beating him at the thing he 's best at . I don 't want to beat him . Besides ... I can design a chassis . It 's not the same as making a robot . Think of something bigger . And what would I create ? Life 's a good start , I think . Come on ! Oh , God . Let it be that I got this right . That 's okay . You don 't have to talk yet . You 're brand new . God , if I did this right , you 're me . Welcome to the world . Well , v-world anyway . I can talk . You can talk ? I 'm you , right ? I have your memories . I can feel them . And you can talk . Right , but I 'm still gonna Have to make you take some tests . Memory tests , like profile stuff , Just to see how good you are . Good idea . By the way , I don 't remember making me , So that could already be a possible problem . No , that 's okay . You won 't remember anything that happened Since I last scanned myself . Don 't worry . I think you 're probably perfect . A perfect copy . Right now , yeah . But what I meant is ... Perfectly alive . Starting right now , you 're a person . - But I can 't leave v-world . A person with restricted movement Is still a person . Come over here . Let 's test you out a little bit . You 're not her . You 're not the same . You keep walking in her footprints Even after her footprints stopped , But you didn 't have to . Even she knew that . Now , are you gonna lie down and pay for her sins ? Or are you gonna own yourself ? You know , I don 't care If you 're not the original Zoe . For now , you 're more alive that she is , And you deserve everything you 're getting . I think you have me confused with someone else . So , are you ready to talk to me now ? You never asked me anything . Why ? I didn 't know if I could trust you . I still don 't . Where do you get off being all moral ? You killed my friends . For all I know , who tried to blow me up . Wee I didn 't want to do that . Oh , that would have sounded very moving at my funeral . There wouldn 't have been a dry eye in the house . And for the record , I would never have harmed Zoe . Now to show you meant me no harm , You need to help me . Zoe 's resurrection program , It was uploaded from her computer after she died . What happened to it ? She 's gone , lacy . This is not a betrayal . She would want you to help me . We were working together . And if you do tell me ... Your burden will be lifted . The avatar lived on . She was ... She was inside one of her dad 's robots . Where is it now ? Destroyed . It crashed and she disappeared . She 's gone , And so 's the program . Wasn 't there a backup ? Not that I know of . No , no . Zoe was very careful . She wouldn 't have been so unprepared . Think , lacy . Wait . She had a pin . It was shaped , um ... Like an infinity symbol . I don 't know . There was some way She kept stuff in there . A compartment , could have been data . You sure ? If she had a backup , That 's where she would have kept it . Thank you . So what happens now ? Hmm ... That 's a good question . The way my husbands are feeling about you right now , I think it would be very healthy for you To go off-world . - Off-world ? There 's a program on Gemenon , Training for s.T.O. Recruits . It 'll help you get properly focused On your walk with God . I can 't go to Gemenon . My mom . We 'll take care of her . Now clean yourself up , And , uh , Olaf will drive you to the spaceport . No ! Listen to me carefully , lacy . I am trying to save your life . Do you understand ? There 's been enough blood . Bring her downstairs and clean her up And don 't let anybody see her . Clarice willow is here to see you . I wasn 't expecting to see you so soon . I haven 't even seen Daniel yet . Well , I was thinking about you rattling about this place All on your own , and I was worried . I 'm fine . Really . I wonder if you 'll be able to get All her things back now . I don 't want her things . I mean , memories are attached to things , Don 't you think ? If you had her ... all her trinkets And jewelry and ... and , you know , Little personal things , The things the g.D.D. Confiscated , That might trigger good memories of Zoe . I mean , I came across something she gave me the other day , A diary . She gave you her diary ? Yeah , but it was ... it was blank one For me to ... to use . Oh . And she said to me to record All my good deeds in it , And I said , well , that sounds a little bit too much Like hubris . Shouldn 't I record all my bad deeds in it ? And she said , well , she should have gotten me a bigger book . Yeah , that sounds just like her . Clarice , maybe that 's why we were brought together ... Some kind of destiny , Some way of keeping Zoe alive . I think it 's why I wanted to come And stay with you so badly . I just have this feeling That there 's more . Have you unpacked yet ? They 're this way . Everybody , this is Amanda Graystone . She 's gonna be staying with us for a while . Get her ! What are you gonna do ? You gonna kill me ? Have you not been paying attention ? Neither one of us can die ! Finish her ! Make her bleed ! - It 's a one-way ticket , But I know you 'll be back . I can 't wait . I remember you from the dark room , Tamara . I know how scared you were . We 're nothing alike ! We are ! You have great abilities here ! Why get caught up in this like all of them ? You 're better than this . I 'm tired ... Of listening ... to all ... Of your crap ! Aah ! That girl I was , That girl you remember , She 's gone ! You put me here ! So stop talking ! See , I get that . I get that on a personal level . That girl is gone , So what does this girl like and what does this girl hate ? They like watching your pain . Come on ! They don 't care which one of us bleeds . Look at them . Is that what you want to be ? Entertainment ? New cap city is disgusting . It 's a place for the people to come And act out their own worst impulses . To kill , rape , destroy . It 's wrong ! Why do you care ? I have a purpose , And I know that now . And I think this is it or a step on the way . I don 't know . But I think you 're supposed to help me . I 'm glad you agreed to come , Tomas . I want you to know that I 've spoken to the board , And they are drawing up a severance agreement As we speak . So I should slink back to the Tauron dirt where I belong . Not at all . Take a look at this contract . I 've given you more than I had to . A lot more . You 're going to make a big , fat profit On this entire affair . Think I want your charity ? It 's not charity . It is a begrudging gesture or respect . You played me well . You caught me napping and took advantage . I turned the tables . That 's all part of the game . Let 's shake hands and live to fight another day . Frakkin ' Capricans . Where are your stones ? You know how this has to end ? This is business , Tomas . Just business , nothing more . Actually , it 's a little bit more Than that to me . You made a deal with the Ha 'La 'Tha , With Taurons . And whatever your fine principles , They will not let me live . So , uh ... Why not now ? You made me dead . Finish the job . I invite you to my home ... And you bring a weapon . I 'm extending an olive branch . I 'm trying to put an end to the bloodshed . Whatever they have told you , They are obligated to kill me . The Guatrau will settle for nothing less . I know the Guatrau . He is not an unreasonable man . You have no idea who you 're dealing with . You do not reason with the Guatrau . I will not make it off-world alive , I accept that . Arkhete too noss-too iayss tayn a-roo-rahn . " control your return to the soil , " Meaning plan your death . I am Tauron . It is important to me To die at the moment and time of my choosing . I choose here , Now , At the hands of my enemy . Well ... That ... That isn 't going to happen . The Ha 'La 'Tha , They are a group of small-minded , vicious thugs , No more , With some amount of power . That is correct . But you and I , we have resources Beyond anyone 's wildest imagining . I propose a pact . Graystone and Vergis , We combine efforts , We protect each other , And we devote our resources Toward the total destruction of the Ha 'La 'Tha . We can do it . At the very least , we ... We can put them on the run , Drive them underground . Return them to the soil . Yes . Yes . Maybe I was wrong . I overreacted . We 're both powerful men . Think of what we can accomplish together . Exactly . It was my father 's . His father 's before him , so on . Swear an oath on this blade and we will be brothers . Hello . Joseph , it 's Daniel . I , uh ... I need your help .

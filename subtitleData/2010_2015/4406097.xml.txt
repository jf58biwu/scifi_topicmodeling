 - Everybody out now . It 's escaped . - Check it . - Yeah , he 's there . He 's there . I gotta go . I gotta go . - No ! - Ah ! - Come on . Come on . - Sir , your blood pressure 's been high again lately . I suggest you stop drinking . - Yeah . Not one word . - Excuse me , Dr. Drake , there 's an urgent call , sector 13 on line one . - Doctor , you are excused . Talk to me . - Alpha chamber has been compromised . Prime evil one escaped . - Oh , God ! - Should i call in the local authorities ? - No . No , we cannot risk anyone finding out about our work . Get back to the lab . Fill a tranq gun with 500 ccs of sedacolin . - Sedacolin doesn 't work anymore . The damn thing 's grown immune . That 's how it escaped . We 've gotta do something now before it gets to the populated areas on the other side of the island . - Calm down . I 'll send a team immediately to take care of everything . Meanwhile , don 't breath a word of this to anyone or it 's gonna be all of our asses . Now ... Tell about the other specimen . - Stewart 's in the containment center right now trying to sedate it . - Is it working ? - I can 't be sure . The growth hormone worked too well . - Oh , my God . - No ! Stewart ! - What the hell ? - Stewart ! - Kim , what 's going on ? - Oh , my God . - Kim , answer me . What the hell is going on ? [ Music ] - Babe , let 's go to the waterfall . - Why ? Look , this is beautiful . Let 's stay right here . - It 's so hot out . I wanna cool off . - Okay , so you go in the water and you cool off . - Babe , that 's salt water . Let 's go to the fresh water . - So ? Let 's just stay right here . - I 'll make it worth your while . - Uh , no . - Bruce , you are no fun . You know what ? I 'm going . You can come if you want . - Wait ! Wait for me . Katie , wait . Hold on . Wait up for me . Hey , baby , come back here . Got you . - I told you it 'd be worth it . - Guess you were right . Come on , let 's get wet . It 's gorgeous . - Ow ! Yeah . Oh , God . Enjoy the sofa tonight , jerk . - Oh , come on , baby , don 't be that way . I 'm just kidding . There 's gotta be something i can do to make it up to you . Huh ? - Tell me I 'm beautiful . - The most beautiful girl I 've ever seen . As a matter of fact there is one thing you could do to make yourself even more beautiful . - Yeah- - what 's that ? - Get me a beer . - God , you ass . Really ? - Come on , baby , it 's right there . Please ? - You 're lucky you 're good in bed . You know that ? - Uh-hmm . I know . - Bruce ! Bruce , where 'd you go ? Are you kidding me with this ? What ? Are you a 12 year old ? All right , Bruce come on , please . Bruce , where are you ? The joke is over , please . Please , come up . Where are you ? Bruce , please ! Come on . This is not a joke . Bruce , where are you ? Please . All right , Bruce , this is the last straw . Ah ! [ Phone rings ] - Hello ? - Beaumont , Conrad . - Hey , mark , what 's the word ? - Well , the word is , you 're about one phone call away from being recalled back here to D.C. - What ? They can 't do that . Not now . - Oh , yes , they can . Especially since the committee and the chairmen both think you lack the evidence to support your theory . - Did you show them the cage enclosures ? - It 's insufficient evidence . Those structures could house just about anything . - Look , there is something alive and big in there . I 'm telling ya , i-i heard it . - And until you have visible proof nobody here is gonna buy it . - What about the eye in the sky ? - Well , i pulled up the most recent coverage from this morning and nothing . The place is vacant . - Vacant ? - Look , i counted at least 50 people walking around when i was up there the other day . - But they 're not there now . - Man , i just don 't understand . Uh , did you get the coordinates for the growth field ? - Yeah , now that stuff looks great ... Even from ten Miles up . Boss is very pleased . - Yeah , well , he 'll be less than pleased when he finds out that Drake 's been using the growth hormone on living creatures . - What if someone tipped him off about our investigation ? Would they pull the plug ? - No , no , Drake 's got way too much time and money invested in this thing to just shut up shop now . - So where did the people go ? - I don 't know . That 's a very good question . - Paul , i think you need to head back up there , take a look around up close and personal . - Yeah , you 're right . I will . But , not today . I 've been working two weeks straight . I 'm gonna give myself a well earned day off . - Oh , yeah ? Where you going ? - I am going fishing . - Fishing ? You 're a workaholic . You don 't do stuff like that . Sitting around all day in a hot sun , wearing those ugly clothes . - I will have you know i picked out something very , very attractive and i think the natives will appreciate it . - Dude , you 're scaring me . - Look , I 'll talk to you later . - Goodbye . - Wansilla lodge , wansilla lodge , what 's your 20 , Cassidy ? - Hey , dad , I 'm a quarter mile South of fern grotto . - You need to dock . - Why- - what 's up ? - Why you always asking questions ? Just meet me there , okay ? - Sure thing . Cranky fart . So what couldn 't you tell me over the radio . - We got a call from that nature photographer , Hammond , about an hour ago . He 's up near rainbow falls . - Well , that 's half way up the Mountain . Surprised he even got cell service up there . - Yeah , he 's got some satellite phone . It was a little garbled . But from what i caught ... He found something strange floating in the water . - What ? - Bunch of clothes strewn around , couple of backpacks , a man 's wallet . There were blood stains all over ' em . - There aren 't any animals up there big enough to harm anyone . - Might not be an animal , cas ' . - You want me to take you up river ? - No , these old bones of mine won 't make it once the water gets shallow . I got Jake over at safari gonna chopper me up first thing in the morning . - All right , I 'll go up and take a look . - No , you won 't . Not without backup . I just want you to keep your eye out while you patrol the banks . Watch for anything strange . - You mean like that ? - Those sure ain 't tour choppers . - They 're heading in the same direction you are , dad . - It 's time to earn our pay . You all lock and load . All right , ladies , you ready to move out . - Hurrah . - We got something . - Wait , wait , don 't shoot . Don 't shoot . Thank God . Drake industry sent you , didn 't they ? - That 's right . Drake sent us personally , you 're safe . Now tell me where those lizards are . - I don 't know . I 've been hiding in the brush for the last six hours . I 've never been so scared in my life . - Any survivors ? - I don 't think so . I-I 'm just glad i made it . - You didn 't . - Wait-wait-wait . - All right , Drake said the facility was three clicks in from the beach . Monroe , marzden , you all go that way . Learner , Patterson , you all cut around the other side . Widge , you 're with me . Remember we have our orders . No witnesses . - Frank , did you hear that ? - Quiet . - Sounds like one of our reptiles . Be ready to rock and roll . - Roger that . - Man , i don 't know if i could stomach shooting civilians like that . - Don 't think of it as civilians . Think of it as dollar signs . Money always eases the conscience . - You really believe we 're hunting giant lizards ? - Guess we 'll find out . [ Growling ] - What was that ? - Oh . - Ah ! - Patterson , learner , what 's going on ? Patterson , come in . Marzden , you near them ? - Negative . What 's happening ? - Get back to the rendezvous point on the double . - We 're half way there . - Move out . - Move , move , move . - Did you hear that ? - Yeah . - This way . Stop playing and start shooting . This ain 't doing nothing . Give him the c-4 . Get down . It didn 't work . Move out . - Do you think we lost him ? - I don 't know . But we getting outta here right now . Radio the chopper and tell ' em we need extraction . - Drake team xv1 , come in . I said Drake team xv1 , come in . - Gentlemen , in terms of investment , i assure you your money is safer with me than it would be in a bank . - Sorry , ma 'am , this is a private party . - I have an invitation . - I have to see what invitation . - You have three seconds to get your hand off my shoulder . - Just show me the invitation . - One , two . - Look , lady , just show me the invitation . - Three . - Excuse me . Very subtle . - You don 't pay me for subtlety . - What the hell do you want , Victoria ? - We have a problem . Frank and his men never made it back to the extraction point . - Oh . - And there 's been no radio contact since they touched down on the island . - Damn . - So , we call in more marks ? - Tell you what , Victoria , when i was a kid growing up on the lower West Side of Manhattan there was this pizza joint on the corner of ninth Avenue an 22nd street . A little mom and pop place . Every box they sent out had written on it , " you 've tried the rest , now try the best . " Call the cajun . - The cajun ? - The cajun , in my rolodex . - Logan . - I 'm looking for a man called the cajun . - Yeah , well , you got him . Who 's this ? - I 'm calling in behalf of Mr. Jason Drake . I believe you already know him . - Yeah , i know him . What does he want me to kill this time ? - If you 're calling to tell me to pack my bags i haven 't caught my quota yet . - Oh , yeah , and what 's your quota for today ? - I 'd settle for at least one . But we both know that 's not why you 're calling , now is it ? - It 's not . Look , after our conversation this morning I 'm thinking again about what i saw in those fields . Yeah . I think Drake might be up to something . - No question . But , what did you go and do ? Something ... Illegal , i assume ? - Not really . I did go over the committees head , though . I called in a favor from a buddy of mine over at Langley . - CIA ? - Technically no , but , yeah , kinda . He hooked us up . - How ? - Let 's just say i had a direct feed when the eye in the sky took an unscheduled flight over the island . - Mark , i love you . What did you find ? - Well , you know those cage enclosures you 've been talking about ? - Yeah . - Well , it looks like someone brought a demolition team in there . Took the place apart . The , uh , exterior walls have gaping holes in ' em . There 's rubble all over the courtyard . The place is a mess . - Did you alert the committee ? - Yeah , i showed them the pictures as soon as i got back . And here 's the thing-first thing they did was call Drake . The guy hasn 't called him back and he 's being pretty cagey about it . But the good news is that robertson wants you to stay put . He wants you to keep digging . Go build a case . - That 's exactly what i wanted to hear . Great , um ... I 'll call you tomorrow , all right ? - Good . Go catch something big . - Yeah , something tells me , i think i might . ¶ [ Motor sound behind ] [ Motor dying ] - Come on . - Ahoy . - Hi . - Having some engine trouble ? - I don 't know . Everything was fine and then the boat rocked like in a storm and the motor just killed . - Let 's get you up here and we 'll take a look . - Don 't go to any trouble . I always call for a tow . - It 's no trouble . I don 't mind getting my hands dirty . I 'm Paul , by the way . - Swanson , Cassidy Swanson . Are you here on vacation ? - More like a sabbatical . My boss has been waiting a year for me to complete some important theorems and i guess he figured the best way to make that happen was to imprison me here in paradise . - Theorems , you 're a scientist , huh ? - Uh , an engineer , of sorts . - Of sorts . Sounds very mysterious , Paul . - I think i found your problem . - What ? - Oh , it 's your prop . The blades are bent straight back to the haul . You hit a rock or something ? - Not in the middle of the river . - Well , you 're not getting back to the docks in this thing . I 've got a jeep . Be glad to give you a lift . - All right , thanks . - I 'm parked just up the trail here . So what 's it like being a cop ? - My dad 's a cop . I 'm a conservation officer with the fish and game department . - Sounds glamorous . So , what , uh , drove a pretty girl like you into that line of work ? - Simple , i love animals . I hate seeing them hurt or exploited . So when i had the chance i applied and got the job . - Must have made your dad happy . - You 've obviously never met my father . - A conservation officer , huh ? So if i , uh , ever hunt down one of these wild boar i see running around ? - I 'd throw you up against the hood and handcuff you . - Really , is that a promise or a threat ? - Watch out ! - You all right ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . - I came down this road two days ago . This must have just happened . - Couldn 't have been a mudslide , hasn 't been enough rain for that . - How 'd all these rocks get here then ? [ Distant rumbling ] What was that , thunder ? - Not like I 've ever heard . - I suddenly feel the need to be around a lot of people . - There 's another way back through the Drake game preserve . We passed the gate about two Miles back . But i think it was locked . - Well , we 'll trying unlocking it then . - That 's commonly called trespassing . - Hey , desperate times call for desperate measures . Come on , get in . - Where are the guys ? - I tried to wake up Kyle , but he was out . Totally out . Johnny opened his eyes long enough to mumble , " go without us . " - Dorks , i knew when they started drinking last night that this would happen . - I know , so do you wanna cancel ? - Cancel a helicopter ride to a lost waterfall ? No , way . I 'm going . - Okay , I 'll go check with the front desk . Hey , maybe we can get a refund on the guys fare and use it for shopping later . - Sounds good to me . - Okay . - Take a picture it 'll last longer . - Am i bothering you ? - Yes , you are . - It 's just i thought i recognized you . - My eyes are up here , honey . - It 's not the part i recognized . - Why don 't you take a hike before i call security and have you thrown out . - Hey , that 's not very friendly . - Don 't touch me . - Chica , you 're in paradise . You gotta learn to chill . - Hey , pal , you need to cool off . - Ah ! - Lady said she wasn 't interested . You have a nice day , ma 'am . - Mr. Logan , someone from Mr. Drake 's office called . They want you to meet at this location . - Anything else ? - Yes , they wanted me to inform that everything 's ready for your hunting expedition . - Do me a favor , call ' em back , tell ' em I 'll be there within an hour . - Will do . Pool desk . - Jerry . - That 's me . - Jerry , it 's me , Chaz Kingsley . - It 's good to hear your voice again , Mr. Kingsley . - Great to hear your voice , too . But you 're not only gonna hear me , you 're gonna see me in less than four hours . I 'm catching a studio jet to the island in less than ten minutes . - That 's wonderful . - It is wonderful . I 'm almost at the airport right now . Just wrapped another sequel to " maniac man " and decided it 's time for a little rated r and r . - Well , the weather 's been great and the fishing 's to die for . - You know how i love my tilapia . But you know what ? I need to ask you a very big favor . - Anything . - Anything is my favorite word . Now , i have the private villa , as usual . But i need it stocked with everything- - food , liquor , cheeses , all before i get there . - I 'll make sure that happens , sir . - Great , and I 'll make sure that you 're well compensated for when i see you . - No problem , Mr. Kingsley . - Great . Oh , and jer ' . - Yes ? - Make sure you bring enough for three if you , uh , catch my drift . - That , i do , sir . Have a great flight . - You know it 's my sworn duty to arrest people and crazy and you can say aped mental patient . - That would explain the shirt . - I like this shirt . All right , we 're in . - Where 'd you learn that ? - Oh , my misspent youth . - Figures , I 'm out with a convicted felon . - Hey , i was never convicted . What ? - Nothing . I was just trying to figure you out , is all . - Where 's there to figure out ? I told you , I 'm an engineer . Come on . - Oh , my it 's beautiful . - Oh ! - Jeez , you scared me . - Sorry about that . Saw the helicopter thought it might be the sheriff . - Sheriff , why would you need a sheriff up here ? - Is something wrong ? - Nothing you guys need to worry your little heads about . - What 's that ? - Camera . Try to keep it hidden from the wildlife . A photographer for , uh , " mother nature magazine " . You might have heard of me , Reese Hammond . - Oh , have you done those animal shows on cable ? - I love those . - Did a few . - Must be fun going all over the world in exotic locations . - It has its moments . - So , maybe you should shoot us in front of the waterfall . - Yeah , I 'm sure , uh , it 's gonna be great for my editor . Not so much for the producers , though . - Ah , come on . - You can always cut it out later . - One roll . Okay , you guys are gonna love this picture . - Ah ! - Do you think it 's gone ? - I think so . - I can 't believe it . That poor guy . He was so cute . - It 's gonna be , " poor us " if we don 't get outta here . - Come on . - What are we gonna do ? The chopper doesn 't get back until four . - I don 't know . Which way to the hotel ? [ Growling ] - What 's that sound ? - Ah ! - Howdy , sheriff . - Thanks for coming so quick , Charlie . - That 's your tax dollars at work . So what seems to be the problem here ? You were pretty vague on the phone . - Back here , check it out . - Oh , my word . - Found her laying like this , this morning when i got back from feeding the grain . - Any of you see anything , hear anything ? - Nothing out of the ordinary , except ... - Well , what , Roy , spit it out . - Well i was mending the fences on the back forty this morning and suddenly the whole heard just got up and stampeded up the hill . If i hadn 't gotten out of the way they would have run me over . - Who could have done this , sheri ? - I 'll tell you what could have done this , this is a cattle mutilation just like you see on the u.F.O. Shows . - Oh , crap , not this again . - I 'm telling ya , it 's aliens . First they go for our animals . Then they go for our women . - I 've seen your wife . Trust me , Roy , she 's safe . Look here . That flesh was torn apart by what looks like huge teeth . If e.T. Did it , he 's got one hell of an overbite . - Yeah , but that doesn 't tell us what kind of animal did this to him . - No , it doesn 't . It 's why I 'm calling Cassidy right away . In the meantime , make sure to call the other ranchers , tell them exactly what happened . - Will do . - Exactly what did happen here , sheri ? - Wish i knew . Swanson to launch , Swanson to launch , come in . Swanson to launch , Cassidy , come in . Swanson to launch , come in . Damn it , daughter , where the hell are you when i need you ? Swanson to launch . Swanson to launch , for the tenth time , Cassidy , come in . - So , Paul the engineer , tell me something about yourself . - Not much to tell , really . I 'm sort of boring . - Come on , out with it . - Jeez , is this an interrogation ? Shouldn 't you , uh , read me my rights or something ? - Stop the jeep . - What ? - I said stop the jeep . - Where you going ? - Back to my boat . You 've been lying since we met and I 'm tired of hearing it . - What are you talking about ? - I saw those photos on your computer . Some sort of secret complex in the jungle . You wanna tell me about those , Paul ? That 's what i thought . - Cassidy , wait . - Grab me again and I 'll put a hole in your favorite shirt . - All right , all right . Look , look , i work for the federal government , all right ? I work for eco-grow . - Never heard of ' em . - It 's an offshoot of the department of agriculture . We offer endowments to private industries . That 's how Drake got himself this prime piece of real estate . Word came back he 's been operating way out of his charter . - What do you mean ? - Well , he-he 's supposed to be developing fast grown agricultural products . But , we hear he 's using our funding for military applications . - And you 're investigating him ? - You know how it was so easy for me to pick that lock back there ? 'Cause i picked it before , several times . - So you 're a spy . - Yeah , but for the good guys . - How do i know this is not just another one of your stories ? - I 've got proof , come on . Walla . - Is that what i think it is ? - Yep , it 's mushroom , big freakin ' mushrooms . - They must be over two stories tall . - Yeah , there abouts . - Something like this could feed millions . This is wonderful . - It would be ... If it were the only thing being grown . - Is he there yet ? - No , but his equipment is . He 's already been loaded onto a boat . - Good . I 've already told him what he 's going after . But make sure you reiterate it . - Sure , sure . - Listen , Victoria , if this- - hold on . You 're excused , doc . - I am not leaving until you take your heart medication . - Listen , Victoria , if this disaster is somehow linked back to us , our firm is finished . I need to know you 're gonna be able to tie up all the loose ends . - I 'll do my job . Let 's just hope this backwards hillbilly you hired can do his . Ah , i think he 's just arrived . - All right , I 'm counting on you . - I 'll speak to you later . You the cajun ? - What gave it away ? - You smell like the swamp . - Yeah , well i ran outta old spice . - I 'm Victoria chase . Drake sent me to help out . - You got my boat ? - It 's over here . Gear 's on board , ready to go . - How about the engine ? - Modified to your specs as requested . - Perfect . I 'll be back when the job 's done . - You , uh , do realize what 's out there , don 't you ? - Yeah . Oh , what are you doing ? - Coming with you , of course . - Oh , no you 're not . Look , for me this is play time . But for you could be a nightmare . And besides , i work alone . - Not this time , cowboy . Mr. Drake , your employer wants a full report the moment this matter 's rectified . Listen , sister , there 's no way you 're getting on this boat and that 's final . - You 're loving this , aren 't you ? All this nature crap ? - Yeah , everything in the city is dead and cold . Out here it 's alive , you can feel it . - Damn , you really are a hillbilly . - You 're something else . First you tell me i stink , now you 're calling me a hillbilly . You really don 't have to flirt so hard . - Don 't flatter yourself . So , uh , Drake paying you a nice bundle for this job then ? - Yeah . That 's not why I 'm doing it . It 's for the challenge . - I 'd rather have the cash . - Don 't get me wrong , I 'm gonna keep the cash . - I can 't believe this . - From what i gathered they stumbled on a way to stimulate plant growth by using elements from animal DNA . - What kind of animals ? What was that ? - Help me . - Somebody coming ! - Help me , please ! We gotta get outta here . It 's coming . - Wait , what 's coming ? ! [ Growling ] - That . That 's what 's coming . Come on . - Get up . - Okay . Go ! Come on ! - Jeez . - Look , there ! My God , is that it ? - It 's damn sure one of them . Miss chase , you wanted on this boat , you gotta earn your keep . Come on over here . Take the wheel . Just hold it straight , all right ? - Where are you going ? - I 'm gonna try and kill that while i got the chase . - Ah ! Drive ! Drive ! - What do you think I 'm doing ? - Well , that took care of him for now . - So ? - So i guess play time 's over . - So , you feeling better ? - Much better , thank you . - Good enough to answer a few questions ? - Dad , please , she 's been through a lot . - No , this is important . The entire island population is at risk . - So what can you tell us , miss , uh- taft , Kimberly taft . And up until 36 hours ago i worked on the opposite side of the island on the Drake game preserve . - And , uh , what did you do there ? - Well , for the last ten months , my brother Stewart and i were developing a new biocatalyst to increase plant growth . And at first we experience incredible success . - Yeah , we saw you handiwork earlier this afternoon . Amazing . - Believe me , it was just the beginning . After Drake industries green lit the project my brother assembled a team of the most renown men in biotechnology . Due mainly to his revolutionary DNA matrix , we were able to achieve astounding breakthroughs . Everything was going along fine , until the day we had the video conference with chase and Drake . - Doctor , I 'd say congratulations are in order . After due deliberation I 've decided to expand your little operation . - Really ? How so ? - Well , for starters we 're thinking of tripling your funding . - Tripling ? And who do i have to kill to make that happen ? - No one . Now , all we want from you is for you to explore the potential of the growth matrix on a couple of living animals . - What sort of animals are we talking about here ? - Well , doctor , now you can start with these . - This is insane . - I was always against applying our theories to animals . But my brother was fearful of loosing our funding . - Kimberly , please reconsider . Imagine what we could do with three million dollars in funding ? - Stew , it just doesn 't feel right . We never agreed to experiment on living creatures . - So , what do we do ? Tell him no ? Sacrifice everything we worked so hard for ? - No , we stick to the original agreement . We are here to grow food , not create genetic frankensteins . - And what if he won 't go along with us ? - Then i will pack my bags right now and get on a plane back to the mainland . - And kill the project ? Kim , i can 't do this without you . Please . - Okay . Okay . But you promise me , at the first sign of trouble , we pull the plug . - Fine . - Okay . I 'll call him right now . - Give me a hug . Good luck . - Get me Jason Drake on the phone . - What made Drake choose those species ? - Because they both are amphibious and they have a high immunity to human diseases . Drake hoped that their DNA could create a vaccine . A vaccine that would not only make humans immune to biological agents , but would make them stronger and more agile , as well . - Sounds like Drake wanted himself some super soldiers . - He was twisting my brother 's work . Stewart wanted to feed the world , not build armies . - What happened next ? - Well , we bombarded both animals for several months in my brothers reactor ... But without any significant results or change . And then two days ago when Stewart went to feed them ... Something happened . Something terrible . Everybody out now . It 's escaped . - What the hell is going on ? - Calm down . - No ! I called Drake just as all hell broke loose and he told me to calm down . Calm down ? The bastard . Do you know what that thing did to my brother ? - All right , let 's give the little lady a chance to rest . I gotta go back to the office . - Okay . - I 'm gonna stick around here . - Let 's get some food , yeah ? - Oh , Chad , this place is amazing . - Yeah , really . - Well , you can 't see it now , girls . But in the morning i have an incredible view of a private beach that goes on for nearly half a mile . - Wow . I can hardly wait . - Me , too . - Well , let 's rush tomorrow while we have so much wonderful beauty in the house . - I 'll second that . - And I 'll third that . Is that right ? - Absolutely . Come . You know , girls , after shooting for three months i really needed this . - So when does the new " maniac man " come out ? - October , as usual . Just about the same time I 'll be putting together the script for next year 's follow up . - How many have you done so far ? - This will be number six . - Do you think there might be something for vickie or me in part seven ? - That all depends , how good of a screamer are you ? - Oh , I 'm the best . Listen . Ah ! What do you think ? - Not bad . - Oh , i can do better than that . Check this . Ah ! Good , huh ? - Well , i think you have potential , Monica . But to really make your mark in horror movies you 've got to give it your all . - What do you mean ? - Well , as i tell my actresses on set , you 've got to think of the worst nightmare imaginable . Feel the fear deep within your soul . Open your eyes , look up , and scream like your entire life depended on it . [ Growling ] - What was that ? - Aaah ! - Second floor . - Yes , this is Dr. rhodes . We need to do an icu , immediately . - Dr. rhodes ? - Yes , from molokai general . - Right away . - What are you doing ? - Something bad . - No ! - Hey , what 's going on here ? - Paul , what 's going on ? Are you okay ? - What happened ? - That girl of yours , she killed her . - Where is she now ? - I don 't know . She must have run out . - I 'm going after her . - Okay . [ Phone rings ] - Hello . - Mark , i am sorry to wake you , but i just ran into some big trouble out here . - Yeah , Paul , what 's up ? - Well , Drake did exactly what i thought . He created some giant monster in that think tank of his and they 've gotten loose . - Positive ? - I 'm more than positive . I was nearly trampled by one after i ran into one of his geneticists . She spilled the beans on the whole story after we escaped . - Okay , look , we have to get her in front of the , uh , committee to testify . How soon can you get her here ? - Well , i can 't . She 's dead . - How 'd that happen ? - One of Drake 's people did it . Nearly took me out in the process . - So we got nothing . - Actually , before she died i recorded everything she had to say on video . So , i think we 've got more than enough to put Drake away for a very long time . - Good , send me an mp4 of that right away . I 'll get it over to robertson . - All right , will do . Oh , have the bureau put out an all points on a woman named Victoria chase . - Who 's she ? - She 's the woman who tried to kill me . I think she 's probably skipped the island by now . Probably on her way back to see Drake . - Okay , I 'll handle her personally . You take care of yourself . Watch your six . - All right , thanks . - All right . - What are you doing ? - I 'm extracting some data . Turning Kim 's testimony into an mp4 . - Dad , what 'd you find out ? - Cyanide . Enough in her to kill 20 people . - I hope your deputies found the bitch who did this . - You ain 't gonna find her . That girl 's a snake . She knows how to slither away out of tight spots . She 's probably half way to the mainland by now . - So what are you saying , we should just let her go ? - No , I 'm saying we should deal with those two lizards right now . Otherwise that lady died for nothing . - Sounds like a job for the military . - Firstly , nobody in the military 's gonna believe you . And secondly , soldiers ain 't no good . I know lizards . They 're pretty smart . They know when they 're being hunted . They gonna hunker down and lay low . They can go weeks without eating and then just when you ease up and you stop looking they 're back with vengeance . - So what do you propose ? - Alligator and crocodile and mortal enemies . I say we bring 'em together . We make ' em fight . And then hopefully we can take out the winner when it 's most vulnerable . - So , how do you propose we do that ? All set ? - Everything 's on board , sir . - What 's going on there ? - Just , uh , sending some hate mail . - What ? - Nothing , i-I 'll tell you about it later . - You know , son , you look like a damn fool in that shirt . All the instruments are loaded on the choppers . - Thanks , sheriff . - What kind of rig is it , Logan ? - It 's a flir double a q-26 . - Nice . - Uh , excuse me , some of us don 't speak techno-nerd . - Sorry , a flir is short for forward looking infrared . It detects warm objects by measuring thermal energy . - You mean like police helicopters use to track criminals at night ? - Exactly . See them lizards , they might be able to hide under a palm tree or in the water , but they ain 't gonna hide from this . Now we fly over them , the heat signature 's gonna show up on the screen . - It still doesn 't explain how you 're gonna get ' em into the ring . - A gator and a crocodile are really sensitive to sound . So once we locate exactly where they are we 'll surround them using explosives and drive ' em together . - Hopefully not to the center of town . - Hopefully not . Well , first thing we gotta do is find them . We can 't do that sitting here . So , let 's saddle up . - Good luck , partner . - Listen , i called in all my men today and deputized some ranchers . Just let me know where they are we 'll get after them . - Sounds good . Sure you don 't wanna take a nice scenic helicopter ride ? - I 'll be more help on the ground with my dad . - All right . Well , uh , you take care of yourself , officer . - Come here . - Crap , i don 't need to see this , come on . - Okay . ¶ ¶ ... - And here we are ladies and gentlemen , at the famed coco palms hotel . Built over five decades ago in 1953 the resort ultimately expanded to over 400 rooms . It became the premier hotel on the island before hurricane Nikki left it in ruins in 1992 . During it 's heyday with its lush green scenery and it 's white Sandy beaches it brought Hollywood icons like bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra , and yes , even Elvis Presley to the resort . - Oh , what room did the king stay in ? - I knew someone was going to ask that . He had one of the private cabanas in the back . But , we 'll see that in just a little bit , okay ? - Oh , it almost makes coming here worth it . - Okay , bam-bam , come on . Let 's go now . - Anything ? - Nothing so far . Wait a minute , i think i got something . Oh , yeah , this heat signature is way too big to be anything human . - What 's your position ? - Just over the northwest corner of the island right over the old sugar factory . Gardner , can you take this thing down any lower ? - No way I 'm gonna land next to that thing . - Do you see that , Logan ? - I have a visual . - Well , what now ? - Let 's get back to the hanger . I 'll get my explosive and a four by four . We 'll take care of that thing once and for all . - Wait a minute , i think I 've got a better idea . - What 's that ? - I 'll tell ya back at base camp . - What do you got ? - That sugar factory sits in the middle of a valley and the only way in or out is through a tunnel up through the side of the Mountain . Now if we could find that gator , drive him in there and blow the tunnel closed , there 'd be no way to escape , they 'd have to fight . - I like it . I like it . I 've got enough c-4 in my supplies to start a full scale landslide . I 'm gonna need somebody to help me set the charges . - I love blowing up tunnels . It 's a hobby of mine . - You 're full of surprises . How about that sheriff ? You hear from him about that gator ? - He 's got all his units out looking but so far nothing . - We 're running out of time . - What do you mean ? - Well , it 's past noon . Those lizards they hunt on the hottest part of the day . - Where would it attack ? - Wherever there 's people . - Okay , come on , gather around . The coco palms resort achieved early exposure and fame in the 1958 film , " she-gods of shark reef . " Virtually , the entire climax of the movie was shot right here on the grounds or near the hotel . - I remember that film . It was a lot of fun . But where 's this Elvis room you spoke about ? - I know , don 't worry . I promise we 're getting there . Now , if you 'll all follow me , please . Come on . - All right , best way to take this thing down is- hit the stress points . - Exactly . - Drake , he 's gonna have to pay for what he did . - He will . I emailed Kim 's testimony that i video taped to a friend of mine . - What kind of friend ? - The serious kind . - Any word from Hawaii ? - Just that there 's probability that she 'll show up here . - And what do we have here ? Female driver , late model sedan . - It 's gotta be our girl . - Let 's go . - Victoria , what are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be on the island helping the cajun . - I caught the redeye charter . Got in about an hour ago . - What 's wrong ? - Had a little trouble clearing up your mess . All thanks to that hick you hired . - Freeze , FBI . Put your hands out where i can see them . - Officer , there-there must be some mistake here . - That 's right , Mr. Drake , and you made it . You 've been under investigation for the abuse of genetic engineering regulations for months now . We didn 't have any evidence until we received an email that contained the video deposition of one , Kimberly taft . Does that name ring a bell ? - She was found murdered last night in Hawaii . And guess who the prime suspect is ? - Ow . - Ah . - Mr. Drake , are you okay ? Are you hit ? - No . No , it-it 's my heart . - Okay , I 'll get some help . What about her ? Yeah , I 'm gonna need medavac asap , possible heart attack and , uh , send a meat wagon . - What 's going on down there ? - Freeze , who are you ? - I 'm Mr. Drake 's nurse . - You 're his nurse ? Get down here . He 's in trouble . Come on , over here . Yes , same address . - Mr. Drake ! Oh , God , keep breathing . It 's gonna be okay . Oh , no . Oh , no . - Paul , what 's your 20 ? - Busy setting charges we 're at the old kuloa tunnel . Any news on the gator ? - Nothing so far . I 'm hoping it stays that way . - You and me both . - Okay , come on , folks . This way , please . All right , gather around , gather around . Thank you . - Now the coco palms resort has many traditions . One of them being the ceremonial torch lighting also known as the call to feast . Even today many resorts on the island chain , continue this tradition . - That 's great . But is that the Elvis room you told us about over there ? - No , it 's not . The one you 're looking for is over there , the last one to the right . - Bob , let 's go check it- ah ! - There , the coco palms . I think we got trouble . This is Swanson , coco palms hotel . Gator must be around here somewhere . We need back up immediately . You ready for this ? - I 'm your daughter aren 't i ? - Damn right you are . I 'm lucky to have you . I should tell you more often , but I 'm a cranky son of a bitch . - Dad ... - Save it , cas ' . We 've got work to do . Crap . Cas ' take this . Get it started . - What are you doing ? - Dad , what are you doing ? - Giving it something to remember me by . - Dad , no . Dad , no , let 's go to the car . - Cas ' , get outta here . - Dad , come on . - Get outta here , now ! Here 's looking at you , kid . - No ! Dad ! No . Dad . - I planted six charges , ten feet apart . - All right , good . I planted five . - What happened to the last one ? - Insurance . - Paul , you reading me ? - Cassidy what 's happening ? - You got those charges ready ? - Just finishing up now , why ? - I 'm heading your way and I 'm bringing the gator with me . - You mean that thing 's chasing you ? Cas ' , don 't do this . Get off the road now . - My dad 's dead , Paul . That thing killed him . So now I 'm gonna kill it . - Cas ' - - - I 'll lead that monster into the tunnel . Once i get it there you load and blow it behind him . - Cas ' ? Cassidy , come in . Cassidy ! Damn it . Sounds hungry . - You know if that thing comes this way too soon it 's gonna put Cassidy right between it and the gator . - Well , Cassidy said to blow the tunnel , but she didn 't say from what side . I 'm going through to the other end . I should be able to help her once she gets the gator to the valley . You with me ? - That 's why I 'm here . - Right . Right there , there 's the factory . Come on , let 's go . - All right , it 's in , do it . There it is . He doesn 't see us . All right , let 's go . - You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Looks like you got your wish . - Fight 's almost over . We should hightail it outta here . - No way , not on foot . This is flat ground . That thing will pick up our scent and be on us in a second . - You still have that extra charge you didn 't use ? - Yeah , yeah , but it 's not enough to take that down . - Give it to me . - Why ? It 's worthless . - See all that ? That 's concentrated dust and powder sugar hanging in the air waiting for a tiny spark would ignite it . This is the spark we 're gonna need . All right- - it 's do or die time . Make sure you hit the deck when i toss this thing in . - What about you ? - See that trough out there ? I 'm hoping there 's enough rain water in it to be safe . - What if there isn 't ? - Well , just make sure they bury me in the shirt . - You okay ? - Yeah . - Oh . - You surprised me . - Oh . Glad that 's over with .

Lest we die ! The last Chiricahua ! He said that the white led the destruction of his people . Not ' true . We were here before them . They have come here . He said that we were us to bring the monsters . We ? They also kidnapped our people . They took my wife ! - Tell him he kidnapped my wife ! - It 's not ' a good reason . I 'm sorry , I could not tell you . - Are you one of them ? - No . I come from another world . I have taken this form , to stand among you . You should have said . You could not take care of the old body ... even if he was alive . You may ask where it came from ? - What did he say ? - What is a world beyond the stars . What do you mean from another world ? What do you mean by " other world " ? - What 's up ' ? - He says you should not talk . What do you say that should I speak ? I have some questions to ask her ! - You are a guest ! - I 'm not a guest ! I thought I was a prisoner . You are both great men , great warriors . Therefore , we must listen to that says the woman , whatever . What are they doing here ? They wanted gold . But it ' ridiculous . What the hell are they doing ? We buy anything ? For them and ' rare as it is ' for you . - And my grandfather ? - And my wife . And all the others . Are they still alive ? If and ' so ' , not be for long . They are considering your weaknesses . These are only the scouts . If we let them live , will return with many others , and no one will survive ' . And ' what ' and that ' successful to my people . I came here , to you ' that does not happen again . But we must work together . He said that his men will join her . In what sense do you join ? What will they do ? Where will they go ? We can find them . He knows where they are . No , not ' true . I can not remember anything . Not even my name . He said that will occupy them . I brought home the gold . And then they kidnapped . It 's not ' your fault . I know where they are . Blessed Virgin Mary . - How did they build such a thing ? - We have come with that ... And ' their spaceship . That and ' just the tip . The rest ' underground . They are looking for gold . And ' so ' , here is ' gold . We can see ? We do not see very well , in the light of day . By day they hide in caves , where 's ' more ' dark . That 's it ! We 're fried . We take all , closer than before . No , there ' another way . Over there ' . From where I ran . We need to attract outside creatures ... so ' , we to approach . And you shall go with that thing you have the arm , freeing our people . We have an advantage . You underestimate . They are like insects . I 'm not ready for defense so they are vulnerable . - Do not have enough men . - I go for a walk . He said he would like use your telescope . The Apaches are warriors Mountain ... He says it would be better attack from a hill . And tell him that ' a fool . There ' hill that takes , with those flying machines ! Jake is going on . We are at the last stop ... Bastard . - How much gold do we have ? - Not much . But I want my side now , to leave the most ' far as possible . - Red ? ! - I gunpoint , boss . Boy , have I at my a deal that you can not refuse . Going somewhere ? The most ' far as possible . - Remember the beach in Puerto Vallarta ? - There are big fish . Good tequila . Want to come with us ? It makes no difference . Not be able to go very far . What are those things , Jake ? No matter ... we would find . Would kill us all . What the hell are you talking about ? The important thing ' that you have a choice . You could spend the last hours that remain , drunk on the beach ... which , however , and ' a good idea ... or you can follow me , one last time . We must make the best use the latest resources . We need a strategy . Listen to me , dammit ! They do not understand anything . You have to explain it to you . Listen , we can not run around here and the ' , hurling spears and firing arrows , those damn creatures ! We need to flush them out from the ' inside ! On open ground . So ' we will surround and attack from all sides . Destroy them ! Explain ... He said that will allow ' to control its people . What does it say ? He said they should open their hearts to understand his point of view . When his parents died during the war in Mexico , you have taken with you , when he was just a kid . You gave a purpose ... have taught the to take care of itself . Even if it was your child . Who despise the war ... Whether you are a proud warrior ... in any battle . He wonders why ' if you 're a great warrior ... have allowed a boy and a woman will follow in the battle . Dog ! Dog ! What God is my lightning ! Are you ready to bounce back your son ? Match ... I know that I was wrong , But do not let me back down ' ... and climb again ! Go ! Hurry ! Go ! I think we destroyed ! ? They were under fire !

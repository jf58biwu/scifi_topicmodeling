 CLARKE : I feel the sun on my face . Ripped By mstoll I see trees all around me . Scent of wildflowers on a breeze . it 's so beautiful . In this moment , I 'm not stranded in space . It 's been 97 years since a nuclear apocalypse killed everyone on Earth leaving the planet simmering in radiation . Fortunately , there were survivors . Twelve nations had operational space stations at the time of the bombs . There is now only the Ark , one station forged from the many . We 're told the earth needs another 100 years to became survivable again . Four more space-locked generations and man can go home . Back to the ground . The ground , that 's the dream . This is reality . ( DOOR OPENS ) Prisoner 319 , face the wall . CLARKE : Reality sucks . - What is this ? - MAN : Quiet . - Hold out your right arm . - No ! No , it 's not my time . - I don 't turn 18 for another month . - MAN : Hold out your arm . CLARKE : On The Ark , every crime , no matter how small , is punishable by death . Unless you 're under 18 . - Take your watch- - - No , it was my father 's . - Take your- - - No ! ( GRUNTING ) CLARKE : Juvenile offenders get put here . Lock up . We call it the Sky Box . - MAN : Prisoner 319 . - WOMAN : Clarke , stop ! Wait here . Mom ? Mom , what 's going on ? What is this ? They 're killing us all , aren 't they ? Reducing population to make more time for the rest of you . Clarke , you are not being executed . You 're being sent to the ground . - All one hundred of you . - What ? But it 's not safe . No , we get reviewed at 18 . The rules have changed . This gives you a chance to live . Your instincts will tell you to take care of everybody else first . Just like your father . But be careful . I can 't lose you too . I love you so much . ( GRUNTS ) Earth , Clarke . You need to go to Earth . ( CLATTERING ) ( VOICES CHATTERING ) ( INHALES SHARPLY ) Welcome back . - Look- - - Wells , why the hell are you here ? When I found out they were sending prisoners to the ground I got myself arrested . I came for you . - ( EXPLOSION ) - ( SCREAMING ) - What was that ? - That was the atmosphere . Prisoners of the Ark , hear me now . You 've been given a second chance . And as your chancellor , it is my hope that you see this as not just a chance for you but a chance for all of us indeed for mankind itself . We have no idea what is waiting for you down there . If the odds of survival were better we would have sent others . Frankly. we 're sending you , because your crimes have made you expendable . - If , however , you do survive - BOY : Your dad 's a dick , Wells . then those crimes will be forgiven . Your records wiped clean . ( CROWD SHOUTING ) I saw a ship launch , not more than 20 minutes ago . - MAN 2 : Who was on it ? - WOMAN : The prisoners ? They 're kids . Are they going to Earth ? Has something changed ? As I said , at this time , we cannot confirm or deny anything . MAN : Come on , lady ! MAN 3 : ls my son on that ship ? CHANCELLOR : The drop site has been chosen carefully . Before the last war , Mount Weather was a military base built within a mountain . It was to be stocked with enough non-perishables to sustain 300 people ... ( SHOUTING ) ... for up to two years . No one ever made it there . - Because we ... - Check it out . - spare you no food ... - Your dad floated me after all . Should strap in before the parachutes are deployed . Hey , you two ! Stay put if you want to live . Mount Weather is life . You must locate those supplies immediately . You 're the traitor who 's been in solitary for a year . You 're the idiot who wasted a month of oxygen on an illegal space walk . But it was fun . I 'm Finn . CHANCELLOR : One responsibility . Stay alive . Finally ... I 'm sure you 're wondering about those wristbands ... - Stay in your seats ! ( GRUNTING ) Finn , are you okay ? Ah ! Not now . Total system failure . That 's what we 're looking at . All we know for sure is that they were off course - when we lost contact , so- - - Tell me about communications . Other than the telemetry from the wristbands , we got nothing . No audio , no video . No computer link . Everything that we programmed in to help them is gone . They 're on their own now . Retrorockets ought to have fired by now . - Okay . Everything on this ship is a hundred years old right ? - Just give it a second . - There 's something I have to tell you . I 'm sorry I got your father arrested . Don 't you talk about my father . Please , I can 't die knowing that you hate me . They didn 't arrest my father , Wells . They executed him . I do hate you . ( RUMBLING ) ( SHOUTING ) ( ENGINES WINDING DOWN ) Listen ... No machine hum . Whoa ! That 's a first . ( CLATTERING ) CLARKE : Finn , is he breathing ? BOY : The outer doors are on the lower level . Let 's go . No , we can 't just open the doors . Hey , just back it up guys . Stop ! The air could be toxic . If the air 's toxic , we 're dead anyway . GIRL : Bellamy ? BOY : That 's the girl they hid under the floor . My god ! Look how big you are . What the hell are you wearing ? A guards uniform ? I borrowed it to get on the dropship . Someone 's got to keep an eye on you . ( LAUGHS ) CLARKE : Where 's your wristband ? Do you mind ? I haven 't seen my brother in a year . BOY : No one has a brother . GIRL : That 's Octavia Blake . The girl they found hidden in the floor . Octavia , no ! Let 's give them something else to remember you by . Yeah ? Like what ? Like being the first person on the ground in a hundred years . ( AIR HISSING ) ( EXHALES DEEPLY ) ( GASPS ) We 're back bitches ! ( ALL CHEERING ) Why so serious , princess ? It 's not like we died in a fiery explosion . Tell that to the two guys , who tried to follow you out of their seats . You don 't like being called princess . Do you , princess ? Do you see that peak over there ? Yeah . Mount Weather . There 's a radiation-soaked forest between us and our next meal . They dropped us on the wrong damn mountain . Here it is . We know they 've landed , but communication 's down . Which means we 're still blind to conditions on the ground . Thanks to Abby 's wristbands at least we know how those conditions affect the human body . Which is more than we 've had for hundred years . So nice work . Now , what are they telling us ? Two dead kids . Dark tiles . Dr. Jackson , please share our theory with Counselor Kane . Of course . Granted , they 've only been on the ground for seven minutes . But as of now , we believe the fatalities are due to the landing . Not radiation levels . Both boys died at the same time that we lost contact with the dropship . - Rough landing ? That 's your theory ? - The dots connect . Would you agree that if it was radiation we 'd see fatalities climb fairly quickly now because I 'm noticing a lot of red on that board . Spiking vital signs . Two possibilities . One , injuries sustained during landing . And the other ? They 're excited to be there . We got problems . The communication system is dead . I went to the roof . A dozen panels are missing . Heat fried the wires . All that matters right now is getting to Mount Weather . See , look . This is us . This is where we need to get to if you want to survive . Where did you learn to do that ? Your father . Cool , a map . Can I get a bar in this town ? I 'll buy you a beer . - You mind ? - BOY : Hey ! Hands off of him . He 's with us . Relax . We 're just trying to figure out where we are . We 're on the ground . Is that not good enough for you ? We need to find Mount Weather . You heard my father 's message . - That has to be our first priority . - Screw your father . What ? You think you 're in charge here ? You and little princess ? Do you think we care who 's in charge ? We need to get to Mount Weather . Not because the chancellor said so , because the longer we wait the hungrier we 'll get and the harder this will be . How long do you think we 'll last without those supplies ? We 're looking at a 20-mile trek . Okay ? So if we want to get there before dark , we need to leave . Now . I got a better idea . You two go . Find it for us . Let the privileged do the hard work for a change . ALL : Yeah . You 're not listening . We all need to go . Look at this , everybody . Chancellor of Earth . - ( LAUGHTER ) - You think that 's funny ? Wells ! BOY : Come on , get him ! No , but that was . All right . ( CROWD SHOUTING ) Come on . Kid 's got one leg . How about you wait until it 's a fair fight . Hey , Space Walker . Rescue me next . ( LAUGHTER ) What ? He 's cute . - He 's a criminal . - They 're all criminals . Look , I came down here to protect you . I don 't need protecting . I have been locked up one way or another all my life . I am done following orders . I need to have fun , Bell . I need to do something crazy just because I can . And no one , including you , is gonna stop me . - I can 't stay with them . - Now what 're you talking about ? I did something , okay ? To get on the dropship . Something that they will kill me for when they come down . I can 't say what it is just yet . But you have to trust me . You do still trust me , don 't you ? Yeah . So , Mount Weather . When do we leave ? Right now . We 'll be back tomorrow with food . How the two of you gonna carry enough food for a hundred ? Four of us . - Can we go now ? - OCTAVIA : Sounds like a party . - Make it five . - Hey ! What the hell are you doing ? - Going for a walk . - CLARKE : Hey ! - Were you trying to take this off ? - Yeah . So ? So this wristband transmits your vital signs to the Ark . Take it off and they 'll think you 're dead . - Should I care ? - Well , I don 't know . Do you want the people you love to think you 're dead ? Do you want them to follow you down here in two months ? Because they won 't if they think we 're dying . Okay . Let 's go . Go on . Shouldn 't have come here , Wells . Before you get any ideas , Finn 's mine . Before you get any ideas , I don 't care . Hey , darling . How 's Clarke ? ABBY : Her vital signs are strong . Blood sugar 's low . She hasn 't eaten . ( BEEPING ) This is Dr. Griffin . On my Way ! Jackson , put it out there . We need blood . A-neg and a lot of it . And then get your ass to the OR . Abby ? What 's wrong ? The chancellor 's been shot . - That , my friend , is game . - That , my friend , is poison sumac . - What ! It is ? - The flowers aren 't poisonous . They 're medicinal . Calming , actually . His family grows all the pharmaceuticals on the Ark . Hey , guys ! Would you try to keep up ? Come on , Clarke . How do you block all this out ? Well , it 's simple . I wonder , why haven 't we seen any animals ? Maybe , it 's because there are none . Maybe we 've already been exposed to enough radiation to kill us . Sure is pretty though . Come on . Someone should slip her some poison sumac . ( LAUGHS ) FINN : I gotta know what you two did to get busted . Sumac 's not the only herb in the garden , if you know what I mean . Someone forgot to replace what we took . Someone 's apologized like a thousand times . How about you , Octavia ? What did they get you for ? Being born . That is so not game . No animals , huh ? - ( TWIG SNAPS ) - ( GROWLING ) ( GASPING ) Chancellor has lost a lot of blood . - If only they found him sooner . - Damn it ! MAN : Abby , he 's waking up . Increase anesthesia . We used way too much blood in anesthesia . We 're way over the line . Your chancellor 's going into shock . MAN : You 're asking me to break the law . - Fine , I 'll do it myself . - ( RAPID BEEPING ) Let them come after me . Excuse me , sir . You asked to be notified if there was news . The chancellor 's still in surgery . But we have ID 'd the shooter . Bellamy Blake is the only person on the Ark unaccounted for . - Who is he ? - He 's no one . A janitor . We 're still working up a profile . But his motive for going to Earth is clear . Sister . I remember . Her mother kept her hidden for almost 16 years . Nearly a record . What is it , Commander Shumway ? Spit it out . We can start now . As chancellor pro tempore , you can give the order to start reducing the population . Not yet . Sir , we 're wasting time . Removing the 100 from the population only buys us another month . Engineering needs more than that to fix those systems - if they can fix them at all . - You have my answer , Commander . Enough . If we 're gonna kill hundreds of innocent people we 're gonna do it by the book . Is that clear ? In the meantime I want to know who helped this janitor get on that dropship . Because he sure as hell didn 't do it by himself . Seems we have a traitor in our midst , Commander . And the hundred have an assassin in theirs . - BOY : Find any water yet ? - No , not yet . I 'm going back out if you want to come . You know , my father , he begged for mercy in the airlock chamber when your father floated him . Spelled " die " wrong , geniuses . If you 're gonna kill someone , it 's probably best not to announce it . You 're not really a member of the guard , are you ? No , the real guard will be here soon , unless we stop it . You don 't actually think they 're gonna forgive your crimes ? Even if they do , then what ? Guys like us , we gonna become model citizens now ? Get jobs ? If we 're lucky , maybe pick up their trash . - You got a point ? - No , I got a question . They locked you up . Dumped you down here like lab rats to die . - So why 're we helping them ? - The hell we are ! You 're wearing those bracelets aren 't you ? Right now those things are telling them whether or not it 's safe - to follow us down here . - Okay , you said we could stop it . How ? Take them off . The Ark will think you 're dead . That it 's not safe to follow . You follow ? Right . And if we do , I mean , what 's in it for us ? Someone 's gotta help me run things . Hi , Ab . How 's the chancellor doing ? Ask me again if he makes it through the night . - Who else did we lose ? - Murphy and Mbege . - Both named John . - Neither was injured during landing . I concur something else killed these two . One second they were fine and the next bang . - Then it isn 't radiation . - KANE : Come on , Abby . - Wishful thinking isn 't good science . - It 's not wishful thinking . One second fine and the next bang isn 't how exposure to radiation presents . Well it could be , if there was enough of it . If there was enough of it , they would all be dead . Please let me be right . FINN : You know what I 'd like to know ? Why send us down today , after 97 years ? - What changed ? - Who cares ? I 'm just glad they did . I woke up rotting in a cell and now I 'm spinning in a forest . Maybe they found something on a satellite . You know , - like an old weather satellite or - - lt wasn 't a satellite . The Ark is dying . At the current population level there 's roughly three months left of life support . Maybe four , now that we 're gone . So that was the secret they locked you up to keep ? Why they kept you in solitary ? Floated your old man ? My father was the engineer who discovered the flaw . He thought the people had a right to know . The Council disagreed . My mother disagreed . They were afraid it would cause a panic . We were gonna go public anyway when Wells ... What ? Turned in your dad ? Anyway , the Guard showed up before we could . That 's why today . That 's why it was worth the risk . Even if we all die , at least they 've bought themselves some more time . They 're going to kill more people , aren 't they ? Good . After what they did to me , I say float ' em all . You don 't mean that . We have to warn them . That 's what my father said . Oh damn . I love Earth . BOY : Ho ! Holy . ( LAUGHS ) Octavia , what the hell are you doing ? ( SPLASHING ) Octavia . We can 't swim . Nah , but we can stand . Wait , there 's not supposed to be a river here . Well there is . So take off your damn clothes . ( LAUGHING ) Octavia , get out of the water ! BOY : Get out of the water now ! ( SCREAMS ) Octavia ! ( SCREAMING ) ( GASPING ) ( SCREAMING ) What the hell is that ? We have to help her . - What 're you gonna do ? - Try not to get eaten . No wait . If we just distract it , it might let her go . Help me . ( SCREAMING ) FINN : It worked . it let her go . Octavia , get to the shore now ! ( OCTAVIA GASPING ) I got you . BOY : It 's coming back . It 's headed right for you guys . Come on , keep moving . ( GASPING ) Thank you Thank you . You 're gonna be okay . Note to self . Next time , save the girl . ( LAUGHING ) ( SHOUTING , CHEERING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( CHEERING ) - Who 's next ? - WELLS : What the hell are you doing ? We 're liberating ourselves . What does it look like ? It looks like you 're trying to get us all killed . The communication system is dead . These wristbands are all we 've got . Take them off , and the Ark will think we 're dying . That it 's not safe for them to follow . That 's the point , Chancellor . We can take care of ourselves . Can 't we ? ALL : Yeah ! Yeah ! WELLS : Think this is a game ? Those aren 't just our friends and our parents up there . They 're our farmers , our doctors , our engineers . I don 't care what he tells you . We won 't survive here on our own . And besides , if it really is safe how could you not want the rest of our people to come down ? My people already are down . Those people locked my people up . Those people killed my mother for the crime of having a second child . Your father did that . - My father didn 't write the laws . - BELLAMY : No . He enforced them . But not anymore . Not here . - Here , there are no laws . - CROWD : Yeah ! Here we do whatever the hell we want , whenever the hell we want . Now , you don 't have to like it , Wells . You can even try to stop it , change it , kill me . You know why ? Whatever the hell we want . CROWD : Whatever the hell we want ! Whatever the hell we want ! ( CROWD CHANTING ) ( CHANTING FADES OUT ) ( THUNDER CRASHES ) - BOY 1 : It 's raining ! - BOY 2 : Check it out ! ( CHEERING ) GIRL : Water ! We need to collect this . Whatever the hell you want . ( CHEERING CONTINUES ) ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) Ten more . One after the next . Abby , look at plasma osmolarity . It 's going up across the board . They found water . Councilor Abigail Griffin , you 're under arrest for exceeding the maximum medical supplies allowed per patient . Sorry this has to be public . The policy on these matters is very clear . No special treatment . - How much blood did you use ? - Don 't answer that . I used whatever it took . Breaking the law to keep you from becoming chancellor was the easiest decision I 've ever made . In that case given your confession , in my role as chancellor pro tempore , you leave me no choice but to find you guilty . We always have a choice , Kane . You chose to press charges against my husband , your friend , even though you knew he would get floated for it . You chose to include my daughter in those charges . And now you 're choosing this . Hiding behind the law absolves you of nothing . Be that as it may , in accordance with Penal Code One because all crimes ... committed by those above the age of majority are capital crimes , you are hereby sentenced to death . Execution is set for the morning . And I choose , at every turn and at any cost to make sure that the human race stays alive . That 's the difference between us , Kane . I choose to make sure that we deserve to stay alive . ( DOOR SLAMS ) ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) Pretty cool , huh ? Did you go to the river ? Figured it was worth losing a finger or two . Here . Call that a sip ? You think this means we 're all going to grow two heads ? ( LAUGHS ) What do you know ? She can laugh . Come on . You have to see this . That 's a toe . Plus , near as I can tell , whatever it is , it 's walking on two feet . My guess ? Monkeys . ( LAUGHS ) I 'm sorry . It 's just , according to everything I 've read there are no bi-pedal animals near here . Certainly not monkeys . Right . You read anything about glow-in-the-dark forests or man-eating snakes ? ( DOOR OPENS ) Are you out of your mind ? You can 't just kill everyone who disagrees with you . I know you all think I 'm a bad guy . But I 'm the only one who 's willing to do what it takes to save us . She 's my best friend . So what do you want me to say ? I 'm sorry ? I 'm not . Friendship is a luxury we can 't afford . And if I have to take us down to a cosmic Adam and Eve I will do it . Please , show mercy . If not for Abby , then for me . We can 't afford mercy either . - ( GRUNTING ) - Sh ! Sh ... BELLAMY : it 's far enough . I don 't want to shoot you , Wells . Hell , I like you . But I do need them to think that you 're dead . Why ? Why 're you doing this ? For real . Not some crap about getting to do what you want to do . I have my reasons . I also have the gun . So , I ask the questions . And the question is why aren 't you helping me ? Your dad banished you , Wells . And yet here you are still doing his bidding . Following the rules . Aren 't you tired of always doing what 's expected of you ? Stand up to him . Take off that wristband and you 'll be amazed at how good it feels . No . Never . Not gonna happen . Is that clear enough for you ? Yeah it is . Sorry it had to be this way . ( SHOUTING ) WELLS : Get off of me ! - No ! - Put it down . Put it down . No ! Come on , man . Let me go . BOY : Get it . Do it . WELLS : No ! Don 't do this ! No ! No ! Come on ! - ( SCREAMING ) - ( KNIFE SLICES ) ( DOOR OPENS ) MAN : Dr. Griffin , it 's time . That 's enough . ( WHISPERING ) Watch over Clarke for me . ( AIR HISSING ) Jackson , use the wristbands . There may be a way to reverse engineer them for communication . Talk to Sinclair in engineering . Nod if you understand . CHANCELLOR : Stop ! Dr. Griffin is pardoned . I 'll deal with you later . Open the door . Open the door ! I spent 12 hours putting those intestines back together . Get him back to bed . Now . Tell me about the hundred . Did they make it ? You wanted to go first . Now quit stalling . Mount Weather awaits . Just hang on until the apogee and you 'll be fine . The Apache ? Like the Indians right ? Apogee , not Apache . - He knows . Today , Finn . - Aye aye , Captain . See you on the other side . - Wait . - What ? Let me . I can do it . I knew there was a badass in there somewhere . ( EXHALES ) Hey , it 's okay to be afraid , Jasper . The trick is not fighting it . ( SIGHS ) See you on the other side . ( LAUGHTER ) Whoo ! Whoo ! ( WHOOPING ) Oh- - We are Apogee ! ( CHEERING ) You did it , Jasper ! Whoo ! Yeah ! ( LAUGHTER ) Let 's go , princess . You 're up . JASPER : Come on , Clarke . You 've got this . Whoo ! Apogee ! JASPER : We did it . Mount Weather ! Whoo ! Yes ! Whoo ! CLARKE : Jasper , Jasper ! - FINN : Jasper ! - ( GURGLING ) - Jasper ! - FINN : Come on ! - Move it ! - Get down , get down . ( RUSTLING ) We 're not alone .

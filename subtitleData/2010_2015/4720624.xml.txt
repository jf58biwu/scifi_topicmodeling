 This is a military academy . They 're , uh , teaching us how to fight . My older brother , he trained here . You know , he was quite popular . He was a lot of the teachers ' favorites . There are times I do get lonely , but I made a couple friends . Socially , I don 't think I fit in all too well . My name is Thomas Lasky , and I 'm a Cadet Freshman . The Academy 's tough in itself . It 's such a strict and hostile environment . We 're trying to learn how to go in and battle and essentially kill somebody . My name is Michael Sullivan , and I 'm a Freshman Cadet . We 're training to fight insurrectionists . I guess I 'm following the footsteps of my dad . At least I think so . I 've never met him . My father is a chief financial advisor at Mezriah Weapons . I was always supposed to come here . It was always something that had been planned for me . Walter Vickers , Freshman Cadet . My name is April Orenski . I am a Senior Cadet . I am the squad leader for Hastati Squad . I was really looking for a place where I can serve the UNSC , and Corbulo Academy is the best . I 'm so new to everything . You know , I wasn 't raised in this kind of environment , so I 'm still trying to ... I 'm trying to fit in . My name is JunJie Chen . I 'm a Freshman Cadet . I 'm Chyler Silva , and I 'm a Freshman Cadet at Corbulo Academy of Military Science . I sort of always knew that I wanted to be military . My mum taught me how to hold a rifle when I was 10 . This training , it 's part of who I am about to become . I have to do what I have to do to get ahead in life . My name is Dimah Tchakova . I 'm Freshman Cadet . It 's been kind of hard , but I think structure guides people . I think it 's hard , but too severe ? No , I don 't think it 's too severe . If anything , it 's not severe enough , and I don 't think we 're winning , and I think we need to do everything possible to win . It 's not a game . It 's training for life . I need to be good at this , because I believe in this war . I 'm starting to think that we could sort these things out without going into battle and killing innocent people . I can 't really say stuff like that at this school , because people kind of laugh at me , and they kind of bully me a bit . What do I think of the insurrectionists ? I think they 're selfish . You don 't kill people who aren 't even fighting . It 's not right . I grew up around a lot of Innie violence , and not just violence towards military targets . Civilians where I lived really had to learn how to protect themselves . Being a squad leader means I am their leader . I 'm responsible for them . They call me " The Robot " behind my back , but I don 't mind . I 'm proud to do things the Corbulo way , the UNSC way . I don 't think we 're supposed to fit in or necessarily make friends , as long as we work together and we work hard and we do what we 're supposed to do . In that sense , I feel like I fit in great . I feel like I 'm meant to be here . My brother always thought I 'd be a good soldier . Being a soldier isn 't about mindless violence . You need a clear head , and given the insurrectionists , killing is part of that . Would I be able to take another life ? Yeah , I 'd be able to kill . After all , it 's kill or be killed . I don 't really feel like I 'm ready to go into battle . I don 't think I could kill another human being ever . Mayday , Mayday . This is UNSC FFG-201 Forward Unto Dawn , requesting immediate evac .

You sacrificed everything for him ! Control yourself ! I can 't . This isn 't right . Something ... Cortana , stop . Hold on ! Something slowed us down ... some thing . Interesting .

Hastati Squad , four minutes to rendezvous point ! Copy , Vickers ! Time of four minutes ! Will you be able to shoot with those hands ? We 'll find out . Come on ! Axios ! Lasky , come on , let 's go ! We 're under heavy fire ! Head for the checkpoint ! Cover it ! Move it ! Aah ! Take cover ! Checkpoint ! Okay , checkpoint , 50 seconds . Go ! Silva , Sullivan , Lasky , where are you guys ? RV in 15 seconds ! You ready ? I 'll see you at the party . - Aah ! Sully ! We have to leave him ! Lasky , what the hell ? Come on ! Lasky ! 10 seconds ! Lasky , hurry up ! Landing , 3 , 2 , 1 ! Enemy inbound . They 'll be on us in 35 seconds . Fresh magazine in your weapon , prepare to attack . What ? Our objective is to neutralize the insurrectionists and acquire the target . We move on my mark . 30 seconds . We should flank them and force a surrender . They 're too close to flank , and looies never surrender ! Dimah and I could circle round . There 's still time . We can make it . 25 seconds . Guys ? It 's the best move . 20 seconds . Look , we 're sticking to my plan , okay ? - On my mark . - It won 't work . You 're not in charge any more , Lasky ! Tom , just do what he says . 15 seconds . They 're my orders . I don 't care . Ten seconds ! Five seconds ! Axios ! Lasky ! - Aah ! Hastati Squad Leader on the field . Exercise paused . Let me guess , Lasky . You ignored orders . It 's just another strategic casualty , sir . Unacceptable . Game over . Shoulder your weapon , Cadet . Your little escapade kept Hastati Squad from achieving its objective ... Again . Great job , Lasky . Exercise complete . Zero wins , Hastati defaults . Shit . The Robot tag you ? Yeah , once from two meters , twice from one . I 'm still numb from all those stun rounds . I 'm always numb . Hastati , port arms ! General Black , sir ! Let me remind you Cadets this academy bears the name of the Roman General Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo , because he represents honor , valor , allegiance . General Corbulo was to take his own life in the name of the Empire . Corbulo did not hesitate nor question . He loyally obeyed , screaming Axios as he fell upon his own sword . Axios ... " I ... " " am ... " " worthy . " But I 'm afraid , Cadets , today , you have proven to be anything but . We are at war with insurrectionists , terrorists who would like nothing more than to see all of us dead . Had this been a real firefight , the rebels would have likely killed every member of Hastati Squad . Every single one of you at this academy was sent here because your parents are the upper echelon of the United Nations Space Command , because all of you are its future , and I expect you to act like it . Understood , sir ! Well , what are you waiting for ? Lead them on tour , Orenski ! Axios ! Axios ! Hastati , right face !

Nah , Sully , Vickers is right . My combat scores suck because of you . Don 't bother , JJ . He 's gone soft . He 's an Innie lover now . Dimah , that order didn 't make any sense . Doesn 't have to make sense , just follow it . I 'm trying to survive here , okay ? You need to respect chain of command . The UNSC isn 't the enemy , the looies are . Spoken like a true believer . Yeah , well , at least I believe in something these days . Cadet Thomas Lasky , report to Colonel Mehaffey 's office immediately . No , we 're sticking to my plan , okay ? On my mark . It won 't work . Tom , just do what he says . They 're my orders . I don 't care . Pause . You don 't care ? You do realize your helmets transmit everything ? No excuse , sir . You continue pulling down your squad , you 're gonna end up with a lot of enemies . Yes , sir ! I served under your mother . I know what she 's like , and I sure as hell don 't need to tell you that Colonel Lasky 's not gonna let a son of hers leave this academy without a diploma . I wouldn 't know what my mother thinks , sir . I never see her . It 's been a long war . Your mother holds a lot of hands . So I 'm told , sir . You know , Thomas , I 've seen a lot of Cadets come through here . Many have suffered like you . Pain like that cannot be forgotten , but you can learn how to tolerate it . I 'll do my best , sir . That 'll be all . How long have you had those blisters ? Been on and off for a few weeks , but these are from yesterday . Any other symptoms ? It 's getting hard to breathe . Okay , well , let 's keep an eye on it . Cryo training can take its toll . Get out of my room ! What the hell , man ? Eric , get your filthy hands off me or I will kill you ! Hey . You really shouldn 't be looking at that stuff , Sully . Score . The latest from New Harmony , Mars , a pair of insurrectionist operatives were apprehended . What an asshole ! He stole my pillow ! Hey , little bro . Hello from Jericho 7 . It 's day 131 in deployment , so I got to show you something . Mom 's gonna flip when she sees this , but whatever . I 'm still a little raw , but we got a big drop on an Innie stronghold next week , and I wanted to get it done before then . Anyways ... So you haven 't been court-martialed yet then ? I 'm not apologizing . Yes , you are . At least I believe in something ? I do believe in something . - Yeah , so do I. - Like what ? Just not in stupid orders that lead to needless violence . Negotiating isn 't an option any more , Tom . So we 're brainwashing kids and then sending them in to exterminate a bunch of overtaxed farmers . Farmers ? That 's who you think they are ? You have no idea what the looies are like . I have a pretty good idea . Well , then you should know how much they hate us , and that they 're not going to stop fighting until we 're all dead . Can you blame them ? Yeah , I can . I blame them for a lot of things . And you should , too . Uh , staying safe , doing my job . I just wanted to remind you to do your job . Oh , and by the way , nice Checkmate , bro , yet again . Okay , new game , your move . And hang in there . I know it 's tough with Mom being gone all the time . Being alone . She loves you . So do I. Miss you , buddy . Miss you , too . Lights out , doors closing . Come on , JJ ! The Robot 's gonna be pissed ! Shut up , Sully ! I got it ! Shirt 's on backwards , asshole . Go ! Go , go , go ! Get there quick ! Go , keep moving ! Are you tippy-toeing ? Wake up , Hastati , move it ! Faster ! Wake up ! Little early for General Black , don 't you think ? Why are you stopping ? Are you waiting for your fancy mommy to come and finish it for you ? That looks like slow motion to me ! Wake up , Hastati ! Don 't like being up at 0400 ? Tomorrow it 'll be 0300 . - Weapons check ! - Weapons check ! - Weapons check ! - Weapons check ! Orlen , lights . Cadet ? Cadet ! You 're already dead , son . Orlen , Cadet Silva 's time ? 51.07 seconds , Cadet April Orenski . Not good enough today , Cadet Vickers . I believe Cadet Silva 's time was just shy of the Academy record held by Cadmon Lasky . Now , that was a real soldier , a soldier who did not give up . Tomorrow you will engage in the last major exercise of this term . Hastati Squad 's future at this academy will depend on its performance . Score . Where did you get this ? Dimah ? You could get in a lot of trouble . Now , you can 't tell your mom about this , okay ? I won 't say anything . Advisory : select communications systems will be down for system maintenance at 0400 . Will be down for system maintenance at 0400 . Cadet Vickers ? Yes , sir ! You realize you and Lasky are the reason I had to run the tour yesterday with you newbs , and why we all had to get up at 0400 . Yes , sir ! So , as you can imagine , I 'm pretty hungry ... and I do love this academy 's quiche . Nice , April . Sir . So hand them over , both of you . With such a renowned pedigree , I sure expected you to be a better soldier , Lasky . Sir . You 're dismissed . Must be tough on your mom knowing her real son 's never coming home . Whoa ! Lasky and Vickers ! Lasky ! Officer on deck ! Outside . What the hell is wrong with you ? - Answer me . - Nothing , sir ! Well , maybe there 's hope for you yet . Sir ? There 's a soldier inside of you , Thomas . I can see it . Everyone can see it . You need to see it ! I know your brother did . Yes , sir . Now go get yourself cleaned up before class . Axios ! Hey , bro . Hello from Arcadia , the jungles of Arcadia . So what can I tell you ? Tell him how you got your new nickname ! - No . - I 'll tell him ! Come on , I swear ! I 'll tell him . I 'll tell him . All right , you 're especially gonna love this . So we make a drop into the rainforest a couple weeks ago . We see this river , me and the boys , we decide to take a dip . Rich warns us all not to drink the water . Yeah , I did . Of course , the first thing I do is to get a mouthful . I almost ruined my body suit a couple times , so now they call me , uh , Volcano . Ha ha ! Volcano ! Volcano ! Volcano ! Volcano ! Volcano ! The Pincer Movement ... the strategy used in Earth 's Second Punic War against the Roman Republic at the Battle of Cannae . Orlen , begin . Lesson beginning . Red represents the Roman 's troops , blue Hannibal 's . Hannibal placed his spearmen and slingers at the front . Behind them , his swordsmen flanked by cavalry . When the Romans attacked , Hannibal 's swordsmen retreated . To the Romans , that seemed to be due to their force , but in reality , Hannibal had ordered the retreat . As the Romans continued to drive the swordsmen back , Hannibal 's cavalry galloped in from behind . Once the attacking pincers connected , the Romans were completely surrounded . This is an actual strategy ? It does seem a little basic . The Romans outnumbered Hannibal 's troops by over 10,000 strong , and yet , they were defeated . Why ? Hubris . Never underestimate your opponents . Never underestimate what they 'll sacrifice for victory . Questions ? Yeah , how do we apply this ? Yeah , we don 't have horses . True , we don 't , but what do we have instead ? odsts . Exactly . They drop behind enemy lines , attack from the rear , neutralize . Or die trying . There 's a question as old as war itself . If someone is trying to kill you , are you not to rise against him and kill him first ? You were hanging on her every word . Why Wouldn 't I ? I just hear the drumbeat of endless war , and that doesn 't make me an Innie lover . Tell me how wrong I am . Look , you want people to change ? You want this war to end ? Of course . Then you 're gonna need people to follow you . Tomorrow Hastati Squad will try not to embarrass itself yet again ! You are a unit ! Your lives are in each other 's hands ! This morning 's victor , Cadet Silva , knows this , because her parents gave the ultimate sacrifice and died on the battlefield . Let success in tomorrow 's exercise be not just for our honor , but for those who have fallen so you can be here ! All Cadets , please be advised , new mandatory curfew tonight at 2100 . Threat level Red . Final combat exercise of this term . Hastati versus Zuma . Aah ! Come on , men ! Let 's go ! Cadets , prepare for cryo injections . Attention ! Today 's mission is to capture the flag . I expect a better outcome than last time . Permission to speak , sir ! Speak . I 'd like to take point , sir . Okay , Lasky , let 's see if you still got it in you . But for your sake , you better hope you can pull some magic out of your ass , or you 'll be running tour for the rest of the year . Understood , sir . Hastati Squad , one minute to RV point . On my mark : three , two , one , mark ! Pick it up ! - Cover ! - Moving ! - Moving ! - RV point in sight ! No sign of Zuma ! Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! Keep moving ! Zuma 's out here ! Watch your backs ! - Moving ! - Moving ! - At RV point . - Here . Arriving ! Equal numbers . Deadlocked terrain . What 's your plan ? We 're waiting . Why are we just sitting here ? If we have equal numbers , we should just fight it out . Yeah , just be patient . Wheezing freak . Okay , they 're moving . Take off your helmets . What ? That 's pretty wildcard , Lasky . We 'll be flying blind . Trust me . Eyes up . Eyes up . All right , flank ' em . That 's them . They 're all together . Found ' em ! Huh ? Now ! Chyler , cover ! - Aah ! Aah ! Lasky ? What happened ? You passed out during the training exercise . My chest feels like it 's on fire . Turns out the cryo blisters and your difficulty breathing are an allergic reaction to the cytoprethaline . It 's a drug we inject to keep ice crystals from forming in your cells during cryo sleep . It occurs in about one in every 50,000 or so . So I won 't be able to breathe every time I wake up from cryo sleep . The intensity of your allergy is still undetermined . I 'll know more in a few hours . I want you to take it real easy the rest of the day today . Yes , sir . Thanks . Hey , bro . I 'm on Andesia . It 's a jump away from home . It 's day , uh ... 496 . I 'm sorry I didn 't com yesterday . Couldn 't . We got pinned in a firefight for seven hours . Uh , I must have killed a dozen looies , though . Mom would be proud . I 'm doing real good work here . We 're doing a good thing . Rich didn 't make it . You remember Rich from back home . He was right there next to me and then ... he wasn 't . A pineapple sent him flying in four different directions . I had to shave it all off for Rich . He said it 'd make me look tougher . Anyways , uh ... I got to go , bro . I can 't wait to get home . I 'll see you . Cadmon out . What are you doing ? Why do you torment yourself with these ? Are you okay ? Whoa ! I 've been better . What did Dr. Hughes say ? That it 's nothing . Really ? You know , we won today . Your strategy worked . That 's just me being a leader . Lasky , wake up . Oh , hey , Chyler . Oh . What 's up , Sully ? Get in here . You guys gotta see this . You look like crap . So feast your eyes on Grade-A classified nonlisted intelligence vids I pieced together . Super pain in the ass to do , but so worth it . This is beyond top secret . I 've never seen something encrypted so hard , but I cracked it . Wow . It 's crazy , huh ? Yeah . Target located . Wait , wait , wait . Now here comes the best part . Wait , watch this . Watch his hand . Target acquired ! No , no ! They 're coming ! They 're coming ! That thing is like two feet taller than the marine . Pretty crazy , huh ? Now check this out . Squad , encountered unknown hostiles . Going back . Oh , no way ! Now , who do you think they 're running from ? Are they fighting together ? Okay , now here comes the best part . Wait , watch ... watch this . - VVhoa ! - What is that thing ? Do you get this ? Are you seeing all this ? It is now 1800 . All Cadets report to the Mess Hall . What do you think that thing was ? Definitely not an ODST . Then what could it be ? Maybe some upgraded ODST armament . Come on , did you not see the size of that thing ? That 's not ODST . Guys , look , you 're missing the point . What matters is that our soldiers were fighting alongside the insurrectionists . Why would we protect the enemy ? Cadet Lasky ? Colonel Mehaffey would like to see you . How are you feeling ? My chest burns , sir , quite a bit . This is for you . Seems like you have a choice to make , Thomas . I don 't understand , sir . It appears Dr. Hughes ' test has revealed that the level of your allergy to cytoprethaline is serious enough to warrant a medical discharge . If you feel that you are unfit for service , all you need to do is sign the release and bring it to the Tether . When would I leave ? Tomorrow . Tomorrow ? You know , Thomas , your memories and choices are all you 'll have left . At the end of the game , the king and the pawn go into the same box . You have to decide what you 're willing to sacrifice . Axios . Axios . Thomas , it is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that today your brother , Cadmon , was shot down by insurrectionist forces on Andesia . All of his squad perished . I 've been told it was a quick and painless death . There are no remains to bury . With this in mind , I have decided that you shall not leave Corbulo to attend services ... Colonel Lasky out . Lasky ? Lasky , move over . I gotta show you something . Now 's not a good time , Sully , okay ? No , it 's important . Now what the hell is that ? Hmm ? Whoa ! Whoa ! What ... ? It 's offline . I 'm screwed , man . It 's ONI . They must have flagged those come . I got to talk to Dimah . Dimah ? Did you tell your mom ? Chyler ? Hey . I thought I 'd give your spot a try . That com didn 't make any sense . Hating the looies is all I 've ever known . Did you tell Mehaffey about it ? No . No . What 's that ? Apparently , I 'm allergic to war . What does this mean ? You 're leaving ? Yeah , tomorrow , if I sign it . Are you going to ? I don 't know . Chyler ... It 's okay . I know you don 't want to be here . I just thought that maybe ... I 'll miss you . What is that ? All Cadets report to the Tether . I don 't know . Campus-wide evacuation . To the Tether , now ! This is not a drill ! Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go ! Come on ! Okay , let 's go ! Full campus evacuation . Campus-wide ... Move it , Cadets ! Now , now ! Move it , Cadets ! Go ! Move , move ! Go to your squads , now ! Let 's go ! Move ! Move ! Keep moving , Cadets ! Chyler , Lasky , the rest of the squad 's already at the Tether . Let 's go . Remain calm . Move ! Move ! Hastati ! This way ! Hurry up ! Right here ! Right here ! Lasky , Chen , let 's go ! Okay , hold tight , stay in line . What is this ? insurrectionists ? I have no idea . What 's happening ? We 're just lining up . We 're gonna get onto the Tether , okay ? Go ! Let 's go ! What the ... Why are odsts dropping here ? I don 't know . Because we 're under attack . Remain calm . Maintain order . This is not good . odsts dropping is never good . Screw this . I can get us on this wagon . - No , no , no , we will hold our position . - Yeah . Guys , come on . No , Tchakova , that is a direct order . Suit yourself . - Dimah ! - Dimah ! Get back in line right now ! Dimah ! Return to your squad , Cadet . I 'm getting on this wagon . It 's full . Wait for the next one . My mother is Secretary of FleetCom . Your choice , marine . Go . Wagon full ! Send her off ! This is taking too long , April . Maybe we should bum-rush like Dimah . No , no , no , no . We 'll be fine . What the hell are those things ? Go ! Aah ! Tom ? Steady ! Oh , my God , what is that ? Tom , come on ! Come on ! What was that ? I don 't know . What was that ? ! Come on , come on ! Run ! Run ! Go ! Incoming ! - Move it ! - Come on ! Come on ! Watch out ! Up there ! Aah ! Chyler ! Hastati ! Get to the door ! Go ! Colonel Mehaffey . Go , go , go , go ! Aah ! Tom ! Come on ! Let 's go ! Fall back ! - Let 's go ! - Come on ! To the dorms ! What 's happening ? The doors are locked ! Over here , in Lasky 's room . Come on ! Come on , come on ! Oh , my God ! Dimah , she 's dead ! Colonel Mehaffey . We will be too if we don 't do something ! Corns are offline . It 's a whole new war . That sounded close ! It 's invisible . What the hell 's invisible ? One of the things is inside , and it is invisible . It 's coming . We got to get out of here ! No , no , no , screw that ! We stay here ! Where are we gonna go ? No , no , no , we 're gonna go to the training room . We 're gonna get gacked up , we 're gonna get some weapons . I 'll take point . Come on , come on , line up ! All right , tell us when . Tell us when , all right ? Sheez . - Now ! Go ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Go , hurry ! What ... Guys ? Why 'd you stop , JJ ? JJ ! Oh , my God ! Go , go , go , go ! Go ! Go ! Lasky , send the distress beacon ! Chyler , help me get the weapons ! Let 's go ! - My code isn 't working ! - Try again ! Lasky , door ! Lasky , door ! Yeah , I 'm trying ! April , come on ! I 'm trying . It 's not working ! Mayday , Mayday , Mayday ! This is Cadet Thomas Lasky ! I repeat , Mayday , Mayday ! There 's been an attack on Corbulo Academy , excessive casualties . I repeat , excessive casualties ! I don 't have access to the live rounds . I think the beacon 's down as well . We 're dead . Okay . All right , think , think . Think , think , think . We can 't stay in here , April . We can 't go out there . Unh ! Unh ! Unh ! Come on Vickers ! Harder ! - Unh ! - Harder , Vickers ! Hide . Shh . Okay , go . Lasky , go for the door . We can 't leave Vickers . Where is it ? He 's right there . Hey ! Guys , run ! Aah ! Vickers ! We don 't have much time . Let 's go . Kelly , inform Command I have four survivors . Kelly , inform Command I have four survivors . Take your team north . Rendezvous at Evac Alpha for Pelican extraction . We 'll meet you there . Chief out . How did you find us ? The distress beacon . Why did you come for us ? You 're the only survivors . In the school ? On the planet . We 've got 15 minutes to get to the evac point . Armor up . It 's ... it 's locked . Stay quiet . Do not leave no matter what you hear outside . Wait . Who are you ? Call me Master Chief . Oh , God . I knew those ONI vids were bad news . Now we 're the only ones alive , and ... Sully , shh ! What the hell is going on ? We 're all following a giant robot . Who knows if he 's even coming back ? He 's gonna come back . I believe him . You okay ? I don 't know . Hang on . We 'll be all right . Hey , hey , you 're gonna be fine . Thanks . Who 's the best shot here ? You probably . Chyler is . I 'm good . I am , too . Cadet Lasky , can you drive a Warthog ? Uh ... Yeah , sure . Good . That 's where we 're headed . Shooters on the left and right . Driver in the center . Stay close to me . It 's your best chance of survival . Sully , keep up . Sully , come on . Where 'd they all go ? Aah ! - Get down ! - Aah ! Get to the Hog . I 'll draw their fire . Where 'd he go ? Chief ! Cover me ! Lasky , go ! - You okay ? - I 've got Sully . Go ! Moving ! Cover me ! Aah ! Stay low ! Stay low ! Chyler , I 'm out ! Give me Sully ! - I got you . Ah ! Come on ! Ah ! Come on ! Come on ! April , go ! Come on , Sully ! Go ! Come on , Chyler ! Drive ! Aah ! Lasky ! It 's harder than it looks ! - Hang in there , Sully ! Sorry ! You 're doing fine ! Just keep it steady ! Bear right , Cadet . There 's an access directly ahead . Faster , Cadet . Four minutes to the Pelican . We have to get off the planet . Aah ! Controlled bursts ! Don 't spray and pray . Cadet , two o 'clock ! Chyler , cover ! Covering ! Kelly , track our position for evac . I think we 're clear . Nice job . Is everyone okay ? Hand me the bio foam and man the gun . Come on ! Come on ! - Ah , come on ! This 'll help you walk . Gah . We 're almost there . Tom ? Come on . Come on . Tom ? Tom . - Chief ! Chief ! Chyler 's been hit ! Aah ! I 'm out of bio foam . We have to get her to the Pelican now . They 're retreating . Why would they do that now ? We 're being hunted . Keep moving north . You 'll see my team . Run as fast as you can and don 't stop for anything , including me . - Can you walk ? - I 'll try . Just keep breathing . Just hang in there , okay ? Hang in there . Come on ! We gotta get her somewhere . To the blind . Let 's go back . Oh , my God . Guys , go ! Go ! Go ! Sully , you with us ? Yeah . Hang in there , Chyler ! We 're gonna get you out of here , okay ? April ? Stun rounds . This will numb the pain , okay ? Hang in there , Chyler . Hang in there , Chyler . Come on , hang in there . It 's okay , Tom . I 'm sorry . No , please . Chyler . I 'm sorry . I need your ammo , Cadets . It took everything I had to bring that thing down . We don 't have any . Just stun rounds , sir . Thanks . - Guys ? There 's another one . Move now ! You have to leave her , Tom . I 'm sorry . Lasky , come on ! Lasky , come on , come on ! There ! Kelly , need more time .

 Understand this , Erik ... These Nazis , I 'm not like them . Genes are the key , yes ? But their goals ? Blue eyes ? Blonde hair ? Pathetic . Eat the chocolate . It 's good . Want some ? I want to see my mama . Genes are the key that unlocks the door to a new age , Erik . A new future for mankind . Evoulution . You know what I 'm talking about ? It 's a simple thing I ask of you . A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate . Is it ? I 've tried . Sorry doctor . I can 't ... I don 't ... It 's impossible . The only thing I can say for the the Nazis is their methods seem to produce results . I 'm sorry , Erik . Mama ! My darling .. How are you ? Here 's what we 're going to do . I 'm going to count to three and you 're going to move the coin . You don 't move the coin , I 'll pull the trigger . Understand ? One .. You can do it . Two .. Everything is alright . Three ! Yes , wonderful ! Excellent ! Outstanding , Erik . So we unlocked your gift with anger . Anger and pain . You and me we 're going to have a lot of fun together . Possession of this gold is illegal . I should inform the police . Let 's not play this game Where did you get it ? A friend . He recommended your bank most highly . I see . Do you know our terms , Sir ? Yes . And you should know mine . This gold is what remains of my people Melted from their possessions . Torn from their teeth . This is blood money . And you 're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it . Don 't touch that alarm . I want Schmidt . Klaus Schmidt . Where is he ? Our clients don 't provide addresses . We 're not ... Not that sort of bank ? Metal fillings , eh ? Not gold . Worried someone might steal them ? Argentina ! Schmidt is in Argentina ! Villa Gesell ! Please ! Thank you . I would love to kill you . So mark my words . If you warn anyone I 'm coming ... I will find you . Afternoon , gentlemen . Hot out there . Beer , please . German beer Of course . Yes , it 's Bitburger . You like it ? The best . What brought you to Argentina ? The climate . I 'm a pig farmer . Tailor . Since I was a boy . My father made the finest suits in Düsseldorf . My parents were from Düsseldorf . What was their name ? They didn 't have a name . It was taken away from them ... by pig farmers and tailors . Blood and honor . Which would you care to shed first ? We were under orders ... Blood , then . Freeze , asshole . Come on , shoot ! Who ... what are you ? Little Erik Lensherr . What kind of greeting is that after all these years ? Where are you going ? To our farm . Open the back . As you wish . Anything back there ? Nothing . It 's empty . Everything okay ? Yes . Your health . Be calm . Forget my face . Hello Once again , my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA . These Americans are ruthless . Now they have their missles places in Turkey I expect you 'll be planning new missle sites of your own . Somewhere you know the American Nearly-warning system won 't help . I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year . And so close to Florida . Missles in Cuba ? You 're serious ? We may as well declare war . Okay . Hello ? General Armivolkoff . It 's nothing . Captain , no sign of any American ships . Maintain course , full ahead . Dear comrades . The United States have dispatched warships for Cuba . This leaves us with no choice . Comrade First Secretary ... We must send in our fleet . Dispatch the fleet ! Captain , we already have our orders . Why so eager for new ones ? I lived through one war , comrade . I 'd prefer not to start another . Battle stations ! NOW ! Fleet reports all weapons ready . From the Kremlin , sir . New orders . As of 1025 hours , the cargo vessel Aral Sea is hereby ordered to reverse course and return to port in Odessa . Aral Sea , come in . Aral Sea , come in . They are not responding . She 's not turning around . Aral Sea , you are ordered to turn around . Do not cross the line . Aral Sea you are ordered to turn around . Congratulations , comrade . You just averted nuclear war ! What ? Take him to the brig . What ? What just happened ?

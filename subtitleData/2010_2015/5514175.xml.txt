" - Where the hell is the rest of the money ? - Douglas gave it all to Florentine . - Should dad 's Hubot have it all ? - I am contacting a lawyer . - They can take Marianne away from me . - If someone tries to hurt you two ... I 'll see them in hell ... I am infected with the HSN Trojan . I did an illegal download . Do we just wait and not say anything to the others ? I don 't think we can remove the virus , but we can encapsulate it . It did not help . I have disgraced myself and my family . I 'm going to die now .

[ Blowing sound ] - Why did you abandon me ? - What do you mean ? - How could you let me go with Niska ? - You just disappeared ! - I was waiting for you . - How would I know that ? Huh ? You were supposed to follow . Do you know anything about love ? - Well , I know a lot about love . - You do ? Do you know how it feels to be me ? To never ever be able to put your trust in a man , Roger . Sorry . I thought you had left me . I would never leave you . If you get me out of here , I 'll be with you as long as you live . Yeah ? Hurry up , hurry up . Hey ... You 're going back to the others . Ouch ! What the hell are you doing ? Rick , that 's not a toy . I 'm also not somebody 's toy , Roger . Real Humans Season 2 Mimi ! I need to turn off . I need help . Both batteries must be exhausted . I am becoming un-well ... time bad now . Very ... - What should we do ? - Isolate my internal memory . Transfer it into a storage disk . It 's deleted when I shut down . - I don 't know how ! - I 'll tell you ... Now , Tobbe ! Make ... Now ... ! Batteries should die , me-die , me-exhausted ... Intern ... memory ... Wait ! - Now ! - I 'll choose hibernation . No ! I want to see you . I want to see you . Ya , I ... Ya , I ... I love you . I need you . [ Weeping ] Hi . Hello , Florentine . I 'll just get a few things which are mine . Let 's see ... The glasses . I called the police and social services . They were shocked when I said that a robot alone is with an infant . They promised to do their business here . Let 's see ... You don 't eat anything anyway , so I 'll take this . The child is still living here ? You , will hear from my lawyer . If he does go to court and wins , what happens to Marianne then ? I feel very disturbed by all this . - Hey , it 's Florentine . - Start packing . You can not stay there . Do not let anybody else in . I 'm on my way ! Yes . I want a meeting with you and Inger . Inger 's not in . Call her in then ! About what ? Can 't it wait until tomorrow ? Okay , okay ... . Ummm Ahh ... I can be there in an hour . Good . All right . Bye . - Now what . - I could not say no . - Why not ? - Because it 's my job . And you ... do not have one ? What about Tobbe ? Tobbe ? What has happened ? Tobbe ? What 's happened ? I shut down Mimi last night . Completely . This is her memory . Put it somewhere where it will be safe . Mimi ! Mimi ! Mimi does not answer . - She can 't . She is sleeping . - Then we can fix her . We ... ahh , we 'll do what we can , for Mimi to be ... - Mimi again . Come on , baby . You think it 's my fault . If I had 't left the code there , we could have made Mimi well again . Tobbe , do you think it 's my fault ? Why can 't you just say that you think it 's my fault ! This may be the most important thing you 've ever seen . - What , a little robot ? - The entire code . All unspoiled . - Did you put the code into a toy robot ? - It 's a USB stick . - Oh ... Well ... - It 's compiled by a quantum computer . Does that mean I can take the battery ? We 're talking about my life , and you care only about your battery ! Oh yeah , i ... We 're going to do this first . This comes first , before that thing ! I get it . - Odi , he did not mean that . - Mean what ? Ahh .. Nothing . Get up ! So ! - I need at least a day for ... - Let 's see if I really need you anymore . Wait ! That is similar to what you 're doing . Right ? Isn 't it ? Yes , it is similar . Perhaps you also created what we see up there ? It 's possible , but to be sure I need ... More time . You always want to have more time . But there ... That 's not the same . It 's different there . And there ... it is not complete at all . Hmm ! Where did you get that ? That code , is the same as what 's in him . - We know that it works poorly . - The code was incorrectly installed . - It was you who said it . - It may still be something wrong with the code . It can also be basically correct . I just want your best . I will improve the code . - How much time do you have left ? - As I said - by tomorrow morning . About five hours it better be done ! - May I ... - Five hours ! Tick-Toc ! Tick-Toc ! Was it correct ? I 'm concerned for your best . See you here in an hour . Florentine ! Florentine ! Florentine ... ! What have you been up to since last time ? They forced me to be filmed . Okay . Before that , forced to me to do things with people . Okay . Here at the Hub Battle Land , I realized who I am , where I came from . - That you came from the Hub Battle Land ? - It restores new life to all Hubots . - Yes , but everyone is not coming back . - No . For it is war . - I hate war . - You ? . Oh yeah . Negative . I love war . Please . What were you saying to the locked-up Hobot ? - I was just walking past . - You talked to her . - Yes , I talked a bit . - How do you know her ? - Tell me ! - Yes . We love each other . It 's true . - Is that why she is incarcerated ? - No , no , no . I don 't know what it is , but they 're up to something . She is important to them . I know what they want ... To invade and occupy Hub Battle Land . Make us into slaves , humiliate us and murder our children . I 'm not like that . I want you to get your country back . NO ! It 's easy for you to say that . Then betray us when we turn our backs . - You think we are stupid . - No ... No ! - No ... - Yuma ! Open the door ! Please ... Roger ... I 'm not going to shoot you . Go . Follow your heart . - Do exactly what you feel . - Yes . No . I am not a traitor . I can not . Good . Now you start working for us . [ Odi makes a noise ] Odi , what are you doing ? Hey . Sit down . I want you to shut down the park early today . - Okay . - It 's time for my journey . - But we have reservations . It says here . - Odi ! I will not die . It is important to remember . I will transfer my consciousness to my clone . I want you to shoot me . Not in the head , but in the back . From behind me , so that it hits ... - Can you do that for me ? - But I ... No " buts " ! I know what I 'm doing , so no buts ! And since I will not need to eat again ... Ever ... I want to have a last meal . Hmm ? - Have a pen and paper ? - Odi ! Paper and pen , Odi . Aged prime rib , rare . Truffle Butter , Hasselback potatoes .. Write ! And ... Swiss Meringue . Okay . When I was little ... I could eat that as often as I wanted , anytime . Several helpings . - Meringue , how do you spell that ? - Just write it as it sounds . A large bowl of it . Thank you . Sorry . - Yes . - Stay here . We have more to go through . Here , you see , we can do whatever we want . It will work well . Here . We will set up a crib and an adult bed , of course . - Err I ... I need to get all the people together . - Why . What 's going on ? There will be a trial . Petra 's lawyer has filed a lawsuit against the inheritance . All of it ? Yeah . She can have the inheritance . It 's more complicated than that . - Marianne ? - Yes . And that goes for you too . They can ... - Shut me down ... - Yeah . - Close the door . - Yes . - Who represents Petra ? - DBA . But who , I do not know . - What are they trying to achieve ? - They want to invalidate the will . Moreover , they want compensation from the estate " to the son who was endangered when he had to reside near " " and was under the responsibility of an illegally manipulated Hubot . " But ... What is the point of damages from the estate if they get possession ? The inheritance goes directly to Douglas 's son , Albert . Any damages will go to the mother . But the essence is that Florentine risks losing Marianne . Welcome to Jarméus and Schildt 's law firm . There should be a Hubot here that beeds to go to Hub Sec for verification . - Hello , Magnus . - Contact Claes Jarméus , he knows which one it is . Shouldn 't we seek conciliation ? We must of course consider it , if it goes that far . Yes , Claes . I 'm in a meeting . Really ? Alright I 'm coming . - Hub Sec is here . - Hub Sec ? I see . I understand this is no courtesy call . - We all have to work . - And what 's this about ? We have reports of a manipulated Hubot in here . You don 't say ... It must be transfered to Hub Sec for control . The Florentine ! I have no obligation to hand over anyone or anything . It 's caring for a damn child ! Now we are stumbling close to abuse of a court action , aren 't we ? You have no illegal unit here ? Claes owns the property and can have as many manipulated units as he wants . There are no public areas here ? I have public areas . Is there a Hubot which goes by the name " Florentine " here in a public area ? You know the law , I am not obligated to answer without a court order . It belongs to the Douglas Jarméus estate , managed by you . The unit is your responsibility . We suspect that it is a manipulated unit , endangering the public 's welfare . You have obviously failed to consider this . See you in court . Goodbye . I hope Mimi 's well . - Well-well , now we 've moved forward . - Yes . Sorry . I was just snooping a little bit . Is this you ? - No . - You ! No . This is my brother . Something has happened . I have to go . Mother is upstairs ... resting . This autumn election is coming . And now a Hubot may gain custody of a child . They can 't possibly win , can they ? We have different values ​ ​ today . - Nah , that 's fucked up . - Yes , Kevin . It sucks big time . My ... Brother died when I was five . He was two and a half years old . And DBA is also legal counsel for the Real Humans political party . How important can the old case be for us ? What are you refering to ? Back when Conny Boresjo had a Hubot as a nanny - and the baby died . I 'm sure they want to sniff out the closet and get some political sympathy points . It will be humiliating , dirty , and insulting for you . I am a Hubot . Why should I care about it ? I think you do . That is why I have accepted this assignment . So it 's important that you tell me everything if we are to have a chance to win . Do you understand that ? You are not like other Hubots . I see it . But where are you from ? Who are you ? I do not know exactly . " Don 't be so fussy " - come on ! It 's nobody 's fault . Thank you . - At least she will not start to rot . - Tobbe ! If she does not make it . And you ? ... Someday they will certainly have a way to cure her . Yeah sure , when I 'm as old as Dad is . I do not think she cares about that stuff . I mean about age . You . She is not going to change , so ... She 'll have to understand that I have . Don 't you , think we should move her to her room ? Or are you going to sleep on the floor ? I do not know anything about David 's children ! - I do not want anything to do with them . - Why not ? - I have nothing against people . - Who has something against people ? - Mimi ? - I do not know . I do not know anything about how I operate , or who has programmed me . I have not asked for anything but to exist . But when I 'm with Marianne , my life has a meaning . It is for her sake that I 'm not just running away from all this . I understand . - Oh-well , are you home now ? - Hello . No , I 'm just picking up some stuff . - Are you staying for dinner ? - No , I 'll eat at the office . - Kiss ! Is this your work ? How nice you 've done . " Sleep well , Mimi . " - But you didn 't do this ? - No . There are more on the desktop . If I do this ... Does your restlessness disappear ? Yes . Now it is gone . - That 's good . - Thank you . That was very nice of you . - My name is Lennart . - Hi , Lennart . But what is happening ? - Is it good ? - Mm-hum . - Are you done ? - Finished . - Eat up , if you like . - Nah , that 's fine . Then we 'll go down . - It 's finished . - Huh ? Your Code ? - Yes . - Completely ready ? Completely finished . - You 've used one of these ? - Yeah ... It 's simple . The next time I give it to you then it 's your responsibility to give me the fatal shot . Okay ? Listen . I can panic . I may have anxiety . I may try to interrupt this . - I get it . I will not shoot if ... - You ! You must do it . Promise that you will shoot . Even if I am begging . You have to shoot me . Alright , I 'll shoot . If that 's what you want . Okay . All right . You shoot me , I 'll move over into clone , I wake up in the clone . - Okay ? - Yes . - Then we have a contract . - How is Beatrice ? Fuck ! The finger ! [ Warning signals ] - Thank you . - Sure . How 's David ? Can you keep a secret ? - What now ? - Don 't spread it around ... David made an error in the code ... So that Jonas ' clone will be destroyed . If Jonas does not exist anymore ... Can you and I can get together , Silas . That 's if you do not prefer Odi . I am very lonely . David is not human . And I love people . I will love you . [ Static noise ] Thanks for the information . What in . .. Roger ! Bea , we 're here now ! - Give him the keys . - Silas , the keys . What is this ! Shutup . I 'm sorry . Be very careful with that . Take it fucking easy , okay ? Bea ! Seeelas ... - Bye ! - No , no , NO ! Fuck ! - Roger ! - Empty your pockets ! - Empty your pockets ! - Roger ! Roger , what the hell ... Hop in ! Quick ! Stop ! Fuck ! FUCKkkkkk ! - We should not have trusted Roger . - I never trusted Roger . I tricked him . The sultry Hubot was used as a decoy . My plan was to get him out of here , and begin the last operation annihilating the people and proclaiming a free Hub Battle Land ! Jonas ! Jonas ! It 's gone to hell , Jonas ! Bea , she is entirely ... And Roger and the others ... - and Rick ... Rick ! - What ? Bea 's gone . She is gone . Well it WAS getting boring . - Can we do what we need to do now ? - But then ... What would you rather be programmed with ? Yours ? Or this ? The one I have worked on . The one I improved , not only for your sake . - Okay , let 's do so . - Wait , wait ! Jonas , come , come here ! I have a good idea . Lie on the bench . Why ? In case you have done something to ruin my clone . We 'll try it on you first . - That 's why . - Why , don 't you trust me ? Lie down on the bench ! Strap him down . You know how to install it right ? I 've installed modified codes before . Do not worry . Does it reformat automatically ? - No , you must do that manually first . - Right ! So be it . - Otherwise , it all goes to hell . - It takes some time . Remember that you must save my internal memory as well . I will not save your memory . I 'm not even reformating you . We 'll only write into you that shit that you have created . Have a nice time . Jonas . Don 't do it . Please . Do not , Jonas . Jonas ! Please ! That 's how it goes . The hole you dig for others ... you can fall in yourself ! Download my clone . That 's fine , what are you doing ? Let me know if you need electricity or Hub fluid . - The bag . - Huh ? The bag . Give me the bag from his pocket . - What 's this ? - A finger . A finger ! - What do you want with a finger ? - Remove the immobilizer permanently . You can toss it . - Throw away the finger , Roger . - Yes , yes . What the hell ... Whose finger was that ? Don 't ask anything . Damn ! What is going on ? What the fuck ... Roger . - Huh ? - Come on . You are my little man and you 'll do exactly as I say . - Hi . - Hi I am totally exhausted . Honey ! - Follow me up . I 'll show you something . - Okay Sweetheart - on the table . - Has she signed this ? - It must be her . There are Korean characters as well . This I managed to decipher online . There is a name . Sung-moon . A page full of names , the same name on the entire page . Yun ... Jun Moon . This is the same last name , I think . I think , it sounds cookoo ... but Mimi ... I think , that she initially was a clone . I know , it ... But her memory data which was stored in her disappeared when she was reconfigured . I don 't think that both programs ... can possibly exist together . - But this , then ? - That 's what I mean . She remembers anyway ! She has memories , pictures - what seems like forever . All this - where does it come from ? There is no information on this . - If it is as you say ... - We must check it out . Absolutely . If she was sent here from another country we must try to track her with import documents , customs documents ... There may be a sender . Are you doing something ? Can I join in ? Are you going somewhere ? - A free Hub Battle Land ! - A free Hub Battle Land ! A free Hub Battle Land . A free Hub Battle Land ! Yaaaaaaaaaaaaa ! It shouldn 't be like this . Hold on , so he does not hurt himself . The last sequence now . Put ​ ​ it to sleep ! - Cords . - Yeah ... Bind me . Okay . Are you ready ? I 'm ready . - I 'm ready ! Come on , shoot me ! - I will ... Damn , wait ! I 'll just ... hang on . - Huh ? - Okay , Okay . Wait , wait ! WAIT ! I do not know ... Okay . Wait . What the hell am I doing ? I don 't know . Okay , come on . Come on now ! Are you with me , then ? Wait . Okay , here we go . Okay ! Shoot NOW ! I do not want to die ! Fuck , fuck ... fuck ! No ... Huh ? What the ? ...

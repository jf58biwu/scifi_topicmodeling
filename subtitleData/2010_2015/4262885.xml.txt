 It 's brilliant . Have some water , please . You see ... That 's good . That 's good . Stop . Lower a bit . Hold the cigar . You , be more virile . Be like a man . Raise your hands , show more pride . You were pretty good just now . But you got to be sexier . A little sexier , okay ? Change the music please . Come on , concentrate . Yes ! Come on . A bit more . Man , put your hand there . Mr Sun . That 's right . Don 't you think it 's a bit vulgar ? Vulgarity is what I want . But we 're targeting at high-end customers . We 're targeting at coal mine owners . Look ! Black suits . Black cars . They all feel like coal . You won 't get it . Boss , that 's great ! You better stop flattering . You two , come over . You were pretty good just now What do women want these days ? Money . What else ? Men with money . Boss , congrats on your promotion to executive creative director ! Don 't be carried away before the announcement . Just in case ... I 'm superstitious . Not using protection ? I meant your cell phone . Look at mine . See-through . Dad must have forgotten . Forgotten ? If he doesn 't come for this big event , I 'll never forgive him . I don 't want to stay at his place anyway . Grandpa trains his voice in the morning . Such a pain ! Doudou 's dad looks down on everyone . Like other men today , he never listens . He never lets others finish what they 're saying . Always turning a deaf ear to me . Sun was brought up by his father . He knew how to please women since little . Auntie , you 're so pretty ! What a little smooth operator . Buy me a popsicle , please . Take this . You grabbed it and took off ! Did you steal the dim sum ? How comes it 's half empty ? Don 't lie . I want the truth . My head hurts . Sun 's mom died very early . His dad was a back-up chorist . His singing wasn 't spectacular , but he thought he 's Pavarotti . He 's just an everyman . Flirting with girls all day . However ... No water supply tonight due to pipe maintenance . You scared me ! I thought the girl came back . It 's 9 a.m. You 're not going to work ? Who did you bring home last night ? You didn 't even close the door . None of your business . Please clean up my room for me . Who do you take me for ? My girlfriend . You 're such a smooth operator . Your rent is so high . Be considerate . You better help me out . Please fry 2 eggs for me as well . Then it 'll be perfect , thank you ! Spoiled brat . Chanel ? The one last time wore Dior . Why not just wear a leaf ? 20 dollars , please . Electricity ! Sorry . You 're Yanni , right ? This is my name card . Sun Zigang . I 'll get a new one in 2 hours . Better give you later . Can I buy you a coffee ? I sell coffee . Then let me buy you dinner . Next , please . Latte , please . Wait . Cool ! Hello ... Can 't hear you in the elevator . I 'll call you back . " Le Herisson " , French literature . I read it when I was at school . This book was published last year . You 're right , I was still at school last year . It could be fate . We both love literature . I 'll buy you coffee sometimes . How about tea ? Milk tea ? I only drink water . Then I 'll buy you water . Deal . Tip , red alert . My ex is here for me ! He 's in the hospital . What has he got ? I don 't really know that word . Hepa something . There 's also an alphabet : C , I think . OK . OK . I 'm not done yet . Find a better excuse next time . It 's not that convincing . That 's thorough . She won 't ever come back . Not bad . Did the girl yesterday go home ? Didn 't she need to be home by midnight ? Morning , Mr Sun . You 're too good , Boss . Can you give me a crash course ? 50 bucks for course fees . I 'm serious . Long time no see , Gorgeous ! Good morning . Let 's have a date sometimes . Any morning news ? We have a group of female interns . A couple of them are lookers . But they 've been snatched by Customer Service . Those bastards . Ly Yilong has left Mio . Her male colleagues popped champagne for that . That 's good . One competitor less . The CEO kept calling me this morning . He asked me to see him right away . It must be about the Executive Creative Director . Keep me posted . Hi ! Coca . Heard you broke up with your boyfriend , Congrats ! The news traveled fast indeed , Mr Sun ! Please call me Coco in the future . I 'll call you Coca-cola then . That hair clip is ... nice . Really ? Certainly ! The meeting with Acura at 2pm is confirmed . And the meeting with Ascot Chang at 3pm . I 've picked up your shoes and dry cleaning . Good . Is the layout for Yanghe Spirit Classic ready ? I heard CS has snatched our pretty girls . We need them for work . Executive Creative Director . Good girls . Sweeties , is the champagne ready ? Already chilled . Did you get the right brand ? It 's your favorite . Good . Executive Creative Director sounds good ! Even better than CEO ! Yes ! Hello , Mr Sun . Promotion is nothing . It 's just work . Bring the cigars . Sorry the board meeting took forever . That 's OK . I just arrived . You look so smart today , Mr Sun . Right , I read your Yanghe Spirit Classic proposal . Not bad in highlighting male sentiments . Nowadays , advertising is no longer a bed of roses . We used to live on tobacco and booze ads . But we can 't do that anymore . Most consumers these days are women . We need to change our strategies , get new blood or our company will go down . New blood ? Do you know Ly Yilong ? The Creative Director at Mio ? Many men are afraid of her . The annual award should have been ours last year but she snatched it from us . How could I forget that ? But you look happy . Our company just hired her . You gave the ECD position to her ? Right ? Hope you two would get along . Congrats , ECD ! Put it away . Save it for next time . My uncle from Japan . Can you speak English ? Your wine , sir . Thank you . Nice . Danny finally won your hand . You guys will be happy ever after . Still thinking of Sun ? I never felt safe with him . He 's a narcissist . Come on , help me decide . Should I go to my ex-wife 's wedding ? Maybe I shouldn 't . I didn 't buy her a gift anyway . I 'm not in the mood , right ? But I need to convince my daughter or she won 't come stay with me tonight . Let me call her . Doudou , I can 't go to your mom 's wedding . Sun Zigang cannot come . What Sun Zigang ? I 'm your father . What a jerk . I knew he 'd find an excuse not to come . Forget it if he 's not coming . I 've tidied up your room . I 'll wait for you . Grandpa will also come tonight . Grandpa ? Why not ? He 's your grandfather . I got to go . Chen Erdong is here . Who 's Chen Erdong ? My boyfriend . Boyfriend ? Who 's that ? Why didn 't you tell me ? Hello ... All right . Bye . I bet you anything . Ly Yilong must look like a tomboy . Wanna bet ? All right . How much ? Are you in ? No , you guys go ahead . 1 00 bucks . Deal . Are you alright ? We 've met . Hi , you also work in this company ? What a small world ! It must be fate . When are you buying me water ? Later . Good . You look good without your glasses . Thank you . You look good too without my glasses on . Really ? People say so . I 'm Sun Zigang , Creative Director . Sun Tzu ... Gang . Frankly speaking , if anything happens to you here mentioning my name is better than calling the police . Really ? Mr. Dong . This is our company 's CEO . He also listens to me . Even the new Executive Creative Director will have to stand aside . Really ? Please be seated . Competition in the ad world is increasingly intense because most consumers have become women . Today , I am honored to present the Ad Killer of the 21 st century . She needs no further introduction . Ad Killer ? I bet you already know who she is . Please welcome our new ECD , Miss Ly Yilong . I 'll buy you a coffee . Mr Dong . You might have already heard Ly 's legends at Mio . The team she led has broken the record of 300 million dollars within a year only . You must have heard of the word " anima " . I 'll search it online later . Anima is the feminine principle found in men which enables the male unconscious to think like women . Please distribute these boxes to everyone . Everyone grab one . In order to sell female products , a man must first tap into female consumer psychology . You must muster your anima .

Here comes Miss Ly . For you . You like coffee , right ? I only drink water . The air-con is in full blast . I 'm very hot blooded . Girls , turn the air-con up . Yes . Thanks . Please leave us for a moment . Yes . Mr Sun , I 'm new here . If we had any misunderstanding earlier , I hope it won 't affect our cooperation in future . I think we won 't have any misunderstanding anymore . How can we have misunderstanding ? I distinguish between private and public interests . Did you draw this ? Yes . Didn 't know this hobby of yours . Very good . If you like , you could be my model . I 'll draw you one . Perhaps Later . Focus the left eye on the ball . Dad . Your nursing home complained that you trained your voice early in the morning . Many of those elderlies are neurotic . I ... Are you denying it ? Those old fogies complained again ? I sing for them for free and they 're still not content . Can 't you lower your voice ? I 'm a tenor . You 're a baritone , to be exact . Baritone ? I can sing High C as simple as that . Don 't laugh at Grandpa . My vocal chord is a bit inflammed right now . When the inflammation is gone , I 'll sing " Torna a Sorrento " for you . I can walk on my own . Don 't ever say I 'm a baritone , you rascal . Why 're you so late ? I 've been waiting all day . I just got off work . Miss Ly . How 's the new company ? The creative department is all men .

Brilliant . Where did you meet ? On the web . Where ? On the web . Still on line ? It 's been too long . So nice to be a woman . Men spend money on you . As the saying goes : " Time is money . Women are evil . " We good men are all victims of evil women . It 's hard to be a white-collar man these days . We spend all our meager income to look good . We better do something to that woman . Make sure she 'll leave soon . Come on . Cheers ! Cheers ! How 's your new job ? Dinner Why not ? Why not sent me your pics ? Let 's leave room for imagination . According to Nature Magazine The Chinese American scientist ... Stay calm , brother ! Haven 't I braved all storms and weathers ? I can 't lose this battle . Anima ? Let 's see how much anima I have . Who 's afraid of who ? Anima , here I come ! Hi . What are you doing here ? Erdong , this is ... I 'm her old man . I 'm experiencing female life . I guess I 'd better go home . Did you use my iTouch ? I need some music , so I ... I told you not to touch my things . How come you don 't get it ? When did Dad not listen to you ? OK , what 's my boyfriend 's name ? His last name is Chen . And first name ? Jordan . Edison . Just kidding . Erdong . Erdong Chen . Erdong Chen . Where are you going ? Pervert ! Doing this at this age ? You 've woken up , Mr Sun . You 're out of danger . So sick . He even wears lipstick . Why all men have this inclination these days ? And the lipstick is in bright red ! He rubs it off . Have I stared at his lips for too long ? Blood pressure normal . ECG normal . You can recuperate at home . What are you looking at , pervert ? Just scram . So I can get off work earlier . You 're awake . Are you OK ? I bring you clothes and your watch . How embarrassing ! If this comes out , I 'll be the laughing stock at school . Have I taken any drugs ? The doctor said you don 't need medication . You just need to rest . No drugs can heal your sickness . If you 're OK , I better be get going . About last night ... Bye ! Ask the boss to give me another chance . Another pimple on my nose . What a pain ! That guy is not waiting for me , is he ? Never seen a pretty girl before , Punk ? Am I in China ? What kind of map is this ? Only 2 apples a day and I 'll lose weight . That man is staring at me . Some men like fat girls . What 's the matter ? Need to get online again . I 'll go for facial after work . Should I get those shoes ? That cheesecake was so yummy . If you don 't pick up , I 'd hunt you down . I miss my honey ... You slut . Stay away from my man . Would I get any bonus ? Not going to work ? The canker sore is killing me . I 'll go to karaoke after work . I should play sick . This man looks crazy . Perhaps he just got out of a mental hospital . Such heavy make-up . Is she a call girl ? With your height , please wear heels . I can 't hold it . Don 't make any sound . It stinks . What 's that smell ? Who did it ? Must have been that man . I ought to train my glutei a bit more . Ignore him . Hello , Mr Sun . or he 'll tell me those lame jokes . He 's coming to take my newspaper again . Morning . I beg you . Be a nice man for once . Hi . Morning , Mr Sun . What ? I just want to tell you the budget for 3D-Gold is ready . And I 've grounded the coffee beans already . I also added some dirt in it . After all , I 'm a Peking University graduate . I didn 't expect to end up as his gofer . Want anything else , Mr Sun ? Nothing else . Mr Sun . Boss , today you look ... Swell ! You 're very handsome today . That 's it ? No other thoughts ? What thoughts ? Weird disease ... Boss . Weird disease . What weird disease ? I 'm hexed . Hexed ? It 's all thanks to those female products . I tried each of them yesterday . Even had a few contraceptive pills . Then I was electrocuted . I saw a fish in front of my eyes . Then I can hear what women think . Too horrible . I want a bar of Dove chocolate . She said she wanted chocolate . Right . I want chocolate too . I understand how bad you 're feeling . Mr Sun , please sign the Acura documents . I better get on line soon . Jean-Pierre is waiting for me . Thank you . She said she had to get on line soon and chat with Pear or something . Pierre Darling , how are you today ? Shit ! Kisses . How vulgar ! I didn 't bullshit . Hi . I know what she 's thinking . When will Tip ask me out ? She likes your hair style . Really ? But not your lipstick . Nor your beer belly . Good luck . That cannot be ! Any ideas ? Did you try the female products last night ? Mr Sun . Did you try the products last night ? I did . Really ? Okay then why don 't you share your feeling with us ? If you haven 't tried , just say it . I really tried it . I even tried a few contraceptive pills . The pills are good for contraception but they cannot ward off evils . Spare me , please ! Of course it 's nonsense . It 's nonsense , I know I 'll be serious . These pills are liked by both men and women . Everybody likes them , right ? What 's more ... Shameless . Shut up ! He 's wasting our time . Coco , what do you think ? I spent the whole night thinking how to sell painkillers to female consumers . I eat that every time I lie to my husband . I would just take two . These painkillers ... I have an idea . Let me break in ... How shamelss ! It 's like this . Close your eyes . Imagine you 're in the bedroom . The wife is sitting on the bedside , taking the painkiller . The husband comes over and gives her a massage . " Honey , my head hurts . " At this moment , this so-and-so painkiller appears on the side . These pills are so mild you can take one even when you 're rejecting your husband . What about it ? Good ? Isn 't that what you women think ? That 's how you see women . Speak for yourself . I guess he feigns a headache when he can 't get it up . All right . You don 't . You don 't either . You also don 't think like that . But Jessica does . Right ? No . How can it be no ? You never lied to your husband of 3 years ? No . Never ? Absolutely never . How can it be never ? Absolutely never . How the hell does he know about this ? OK , let 's adjourn the meeting today .

Who do you think you are ? I 'm just the executive creative director . Let us raise ... I 'm hexed . What do you mean by hexed ? My ears are filled with women 's voices . I can hear everything they are thinking . Tell me what those old women are thinking . They say this old fogey torture us every day with his broken voice . But he 's good-looking . Looks like it 's in our genes . I knew I had this super power . When your mom was still alive , I always knew what 's in her mind . I know what you think . You resent that I have neither power nor money . Power and money are what you want . I 'm not that narrow-minded . I sing well so I won 't let the people and my country down . So what was Mom thinking when she 's alive ? Hey . She wondered why she had married this selfish , egomaniac man . Your mom didn 't only marry a man like me . She also gave birth to a rascal like you . Dad , why did you come home so early ? It 'd be too late if I came later ! It 's over ! So embarrassing ! Hello , Uncle . Being caught by Dad ... Get out ! Damn you . Dad . He promised to take me to a party . Don 't mess it up . I won 't let you go to a party with this tramp . Who said anything about a party ? Boys of this age . .. I know what 's in their heads . I tell you . Don 't touch my daughter . Your daughter ? So now you 're worried about me ? How can I have a father like him ? It 's your blessing to have a father like this . I 'm splitting . My clothes ... Nobody 's keeping you . Get out ! That 's yours . That 's mine . You come back ! You come back ! Come back ! Be careful . Wake up . If I hadn 't waken you up , your company would have fired you a long time ago . Hurry and get up ! I bought you a pancake . So lazy ! Get up ! Get up ! Are you out of your mind ? What happened ? Wanna woo me ? No more ! No more ! I don 't hear anything . You 're crazy . Auntie , you sing pretty well . Sing ? I didn 't sing anything . So many people have come in the past two days . Nice brand . It 's purple . Goes well with my thong . Is the thong comfortable , Auntie ? I 'm not as trendy as you think . What 's a thong ? How does he know I wear that thong ? How do I know you wear thong ? I can hear what women are thinking . Then tell me what I am thinking . You think this guy is pulling your leg . Try again . You think this lipstick can stand for eye shadow . L 'Oreal for your eldest girl , mascara for the second . This could be super power . This power is a pain . You call it a pain ? If I had this power I could control my daughter-in-law totally . If my husband had this power , I wouldn 't have any saving left . Kid , with this power , can 't you control every woman in the world ? Let 's just open a psychiatric clinic and call it " I Know Women 's Heart " . You understand me better than myself . Your guess is so accurate . Keep guessing . Hi . Bye . Bye . What can I help you ? Didn 't he say he 'd buy me dinner ? Why no action ? I was too shy to ask . But today I musted the courage to come here to ask you out for dinner tonight . What do you think ? I won 't accept it so easily . I 'll pick you up at 7pm . That 's fattening . Better let you eat it . Eat . It wouldn 't help much anyway ! My computer 's down , and he didn 't pick up the phone . Is Jean-Pierre sick ? Hi . Mr Sun . Is Pear ill ? Pear ?

That Lot ... Lot what ? Does he mean Lotto ? Lotto . How did he find out about Lotto ? Italy 's No.1 sports brand . Not many people know about this . Your intelligence is amazing . I know you won 't mind . Of course I don 't mind . Please take a seat . OK . However , this is still a trade secret . Given the competitiveness in the market , I think we better be more careful . Do you know how big the fish is ? I 'll get that fish for sure . Lotto 's female line emphasizes female freedom and being unfettered . He won 't even get it . Don 't worry . I 'll win over Lotto . Keep bragging . I 'll see how you 'll do that . Good ! I 'll wait for your good news . Great ! I find you two at the same time . Look at this print ad for Aimer . I find something odd about it . The bag is superfluous . It gets the priorities wrong . The bag is superfluous . How should I say ? It gets the priorities wrong . What do you think , Miss Ly ? How comes he thinks exactly like me ?

It 's not strong at all . Isn 't she the barista downstairs ? Sun has poor taste in women . Stop drinking . You 'd love me when I 'm drunk . It 's easy to get drunk . I shouldn 't have asked him to come from Shanghai . You 're from Shanghai . Yes . What are you here for ? In fact , I 'm a head hunter . I have a mission here . What mission ?

You must be kidding . I like you . Really ? So true . I live upstairs . You want to come up for a while ? How stupid ! How could I say that ? Maybe next time . It hurts ! I like you , but I don 't want us to go so fast . I 'm afraid I might fall in love with you . Then we 'll let it happen . Prince Pauper ? I 'll dump him if he doesn 't propose . It 's been late . Am I pregnant ? What a gentleman ! I 'm maxed out my credit card again . I get excited when I shop . The bag is nice , but I can 't afford it . This guy looks like Andy Lau . This old fashioned one suits my mom . Riding my bike always relaxes me . I want my belly gone ... Is this guy on botox ? Beautiful pursuit , blissful possession . That 's perfect . We need innovation . Perhaps we can try rock ' n roll . This font . This one is better . Mr Dong . Have a seat . Here 's the layout . Rock n ' roll bride ? Aren 't they Sun 's idea ? Sun 's idea ? Hello , Miss Ly . Mr Sun can 't stand the heat . Don 't you have fans ? Use them . What can I help you ? I have an idea . From now on , everyone in this company should have a nickname that fits his personality . Nicknames ? That 's my forte . Let me give you a nickname first . OK . The Expert . The Expert Sun . Thank you . How dare I accept this name in front of you ? The Stealing Expert . What do you mean ? What did I steal ? You know very well what you 've stolen . I want to know how you stole it . What have I stolen ? Spit it out . Take it easy . No need to be mad . If you haven 't stolen it , why should you be mad ? Why am I mad ? Sun Zigang ! You should 've been shrewder even if you stole it . Change a bit . Alter the look . Make something new . Come clean regarding this creativity idea one day , or don 't let me see your face anymore . Is that clear ? Don 't go . Where 's your proof ? Come in . You want the proof ? There it is ! Eavesdropping is the characteristic of this office . It suits your style . Who are you looking for ? I 'm looking for my father . Who 's your father ? Sun Zigang . He 's in that room . OK . You 're Doudou ? How do you know who I am ? Your father mentions you all the time . Impossible . Why impossible ? Take a seat . I don 't look like him . But you 're prettier . Really ? Don 't let him know . I think he 's jealous . Right . I think so too . Why 're you here ? There 're visiting hours even in jail . I 'm here to see you . Let 's go . Let 's go shopping one day . Bye ! Bye . What were you chatting about ? Lots of things . Don 't be too close to her . She 's my enemy . No wonder we hit it off so well . Did you read the materials I sent last night ? Yes . Yes ? Let 's have a quiz today then . In which city is Lotto 's first flagship store located ? Chongqing . Wrong . Guangzhou . Nanjing . Wrong . Shanghai . Wrong . All wrong . Stay here and study the materials . Before you remember them , don 't leave the room . Where 's Mr Sun ? He 's looking for his anima . Coco . You really think I 'm sissy and not manly enough ? I never said that . Look at your girly fingers . You said ... You don 't like my lipstick and my belly . That rings a bell ? Hippo must have told him . What a big mouth ! I really didn 't tell him . This company judges people by their appearance . Look ! Who cares ? I better see that Korean doctor again and finish off my operation . I like your simple style . That 's the same as saying I 'm unfashionable . Liu Yang . I am saying you 're natural and genuine . She actually knows my name . I 'll take less next time . I didn 't know he 's so good . Having a fit like this , isn 't it silly ? It 's a waste of time . Looks like you and Yilong work out OK . I admire your generosity , man ! Yilong is not bad as a person , but she 's not a team player . She doesn 't want to work with others ? I spent a fortune hiring her . I didn 't mean that . It 's just that ... Come on in . Mr Dong , Miss Ly is here . Good . You have things to talk about . Let me be excused . Mr Dong , you 're looking for me . Miss Ly , please . Miss Ly . I 've looked into the dispute of the creative idea . Sun has been in our company for years . To his team , this creative idea should be no big deal . Sorry , Mr Dong . I was too suspicious . Miss Ly . You better build up team spirit . I understand . Mr Sun , your magazine . Just leave it there . It 's just biking . Why such a heavy make-up ? But it 's an improvement . At least not a woman in bikini . When I ride a bike on the hill path by myself , I 'll look down on the scenery from the peak , and my worries will disappear . That 's real enjoyment . Carry on . What did I say ? Hi Boss . This is so creative ! What does Liu Yang do in this company ? She was a copywriter before , but ... But what ? But what ? I think because she 's not good looking , she couldn 't get into our creative team . Which bastard decided that ? You don 't say . This color only looks good on her . Really ? You 're right . You should shut your mouth Shut it ... It 's like a hippo . Don 't you know that ? And you . Always weight-conscious . Be natural , and you 'd be beautiful . It 's about time . OK . Get to work . Go . Bye , Mr Sun ! Bye ! Bye ! I think he 's still mad at me . Mr Sun . I want to apologize to you . For what ? Regarding that creative idea . I 'm sorry . I 've forgotten already . I should thank you instead for awakening the anima within me . Thank you . Thanks for taking care of my girl the other day . You 're welcome . I 'm fond of her . Really ? Not bad at all . But something is missing . I feel that something 's missing . I also feel something missing . What 's missing ? What are these girls thinking ? No pressure . Free and unfettered . Not bad . Looks like he understands women after all . No pressure . Free and unfettered . Let me think if there 's anything better . No pressure . Free and unfettered . Lotto . Lot of pleasure , To wherever I choose . Any good ideas ? Not really . Why did you nod your head then ? What do you think of this ? Lot of pleasure , To wherever I choose . Did I think aloud ? How come we have the same idea again ? What ? Lot of pleasure ... To wherever I choose . Lot of pleasure , To wherever I choose . Write it down . Miss Ly , it 's very late . Time to go home . I thought we 're off work already . It 's your boss 's work but your own body . What 's this ? Decorative art . Rather impressionistic . If you can guess what it is , I 'll buy you a drink . I hear you ! Deal . A cock ? A dolphin ? Who can tell it 's a pot of orchids ? Orchids ! You really got it ! Cheers ! Cheers for what ? Bottoms up ! I 've learnt a lot from you since you came . I think we work quite OK together . I think so too . Help me look at something . Sure . Have a look at these Lotto materials . Right here ? Perhaps that one of yours ... If we ... What do you think ? We re-arrange it this way . Right ... Okay , okay . Stand over there and look . This way ... No ... Can you scoot over ? I can 't . I like this the most . This one is chubby . And this ... This one needs to lose weight . Make a copy and give it to me on Monday . Yes . You 're still here ? Yes .. It 's the weekend . Not spending time with your girl ? She 's too busy to need me around . It 's my turn . What ? To buy you a drink How come we 're getting closer ? I need to run some errands . I 'll take a raincheck . What ? Look . It 's taken by you . Yes . So ugly . Erase it . No way . Erase it . I like this picture . Why ? You didn 't put on any makeup that day . I never let anyone see me without makeup . I 'm not a man ? No , I don 't mean that . What are you most afraid of ? Your dad ? Your daughter ? I 'm afraid of baldness . And you ? I ... Don 't say it . Let me guess . Look at me . You 're afraid of glasses . You got it again . Yes . I 'm afraid of trusting the wrong person , even with my glasses on . Can you see me clearly ? You 're very exact . How so ? You crawled out of the office early in the morning . You saw that ? Of course . I even took pictures of you . Erase the picture . No . You 're very natural in the picture . You 're in a good mood today . It shows ? You 've met ? How do you feel ? You 've taken my advice . He 's quite a nice guy . You 'll get along with 007 . What 007 ? It 's not him ? Are you ready ? You should lead the Lotto presentation later . No , it 's your creative idea . We agreed , right ? I ... What 's wrong with him today ? I ... I 'm a bit nervous . Relax . You can do it . Time to go . OK . The same path , but not the same way . Rather than marking time indoors , why not enjoy the speed of wind with me ? Tap into your senses and encounter unexpected wonder . Lotto : Lot of pleasure To wherever I choose . No . Go back in ! What are you wearing ? Doudou . We never have a father and daughter talk . Let 's have a good chat today . Buy me a dress and you 're my best friend ? I 'm not striving to be your best friend . I know I 've not been a good father . Just like grandpa . So you 're a good dad now ? But that doesn 't mean I have no right to educate you . Educate me ? Do you know ? Boys and girls don 't think alike these days . How do you know what girls think ? Girls want boys to enjoy their company . Boys don 't think the same . Boys only think of that . Sex education ? Just say so . Mom told me about it when I was 1 0 . You never minded me all these years . What 's wrong with him now ? I 'm going to the movies with my friends . Got to go . Go . That 's a CD I bought for Grandpa . Please pass it to him . I 'll take it back for you . That 's OK . This old pa should accept his fate , man . What she said was right . It 's from Doudou . This child is very precocious . She knows I 'm starting a choir . Look . She bought this CD for me . You 're getting popular . What 's your secret ? What 's your secret ? Let me tell you . I finally understand you need to be frank to others before they will be frank to you . What kind of crap theory is that ? You know this crap theory all along . You do know how to pick . You picked the only pic where Mom was smiling . You 've become a public darling in just a few days ! So beloved . When Mom was still alive , what had you done ? I admit I wasn 't a good father and I wasn 't a good husband . When your mom was alive , I never knew what she wanted and I never wanted to know . I admit I 'm a baritone . I never regret that . My only regret is I never listened to what your mom had to say . Yilong . It 's me . How did he know it 's me ? I have caller display . Right . How silly ! What 's up ? Nothing much . Just want to say hi . I want to see you . What a coincidence ! I was planning to call you . Are you free to meet up ? Sure . Why so quiet today ? I forget who said this . Jazz is like an old man narrating his whole life , laying bare all the sins he has committed . As one gets older , one fears loneliness the most . Not only old men . Everyone is afraid of loneliness . A formidable person like you won 't stay in our company for long . One of these days you 're bound to leave us . Why are you saying this ? Peter said it the other evening at the sushi place . I was shocked . I thought you really were leaving . I won 't . You promise ? If I 'm gone , who will bother you anymore ? What song would you want to hear ? I 'll listen to whatever songs you sing . I 'm dedicating this song to my friend . It 's for you . Every time I look into the mirror of my mind I barely recognize the man I see I feel the tide is turning and I 'm stranded out at sea I thought I could survive But reality has got a better part of me If I could I would change my yesterday I would listen to my heart and then Today I 'd see what true love could be And I won 't let tomorrow I won 't let tomorrow slip away If I could I would change my yesterday I would listen to my heart and then Today I 'd see what true love could be And I won 't let tomorrow I won 't let tomorrow slip away Haven 't been that happy for a while . Thanks ! Ditto . I shouldn 't invite him over . It 's too late . It 's late . See you at the office tomorrow . All right . Goodnight . Hey . Goodnight . Hi . Since our last date , one week has passed by . You never called me again . You didn 't even come for coffee . I 'm actually . .. I know your secret . Or how do you know women 's hearts so well ? You know ? I can 't fool me . You 're so considerate and sensitive . Just spit it out . I ... I admit I 'm ... I 'm ... Gay , right ? I ... No ... I couldn 't understand at that time how comes with my body and looks , I could still be dumped . I 'd rather jump off a building . Wait . Listen to me . Drive . Stop ! I 'm sorry . I admit ... I 'm gay . Zigang , thank you for your honesty . Good . Yilong , I don 't know when I can come clean to you . I 'm not an honest person . I have to tell you this , or ... or I 'll regret for the rest of my life . Isn 't it a bit too indirect ? Cut to the chase . You get it , Sun ? Yilong , I 'm a shameless man . I cheat , lie , plagiarize ... Isn 't that a bit too strong ? Mr Sun . Let me take you to a place to celebrate . Let 's go ! My new apartment . So beautiful . You bought it ? You really bought it ? I really bought it . Didn 't I promise you I wouldn 't leave ? What 's upstairs ? Go up and have a look . Come . Let 's drink to your new apartment ! No , We should drink to you today . Your proposal was a success . You 're the pride of our company . I should say that about you . I know your contribution in this matter . Without you , it couldn 't have been a success . He 's a bit weird . Did I say something wrong ? I have a lot of friends but only a few I can share my confidence . I want to share something with you today . Sure . We won 't talk shop today anyway . You can tell me anything . Is he going to say he 's in love with me ? I 'm a dishonest man . Can you accept ... Are you feeling all right ? Do you have painkillers ? I 'll look for them . Don 't worry . I 'll go buy . I 'll go with you . No ... No ... Really no need ... I 'll be back soon . It was a great singing session . 1 0-minute tea break . Your act is equivalent to piracy . You know that ? Did you confess to her ? I hinted . Hinted ? I know you 'll say that . She won 't believe me . You sly fox ! If you don 't want to regret your whole life like me , you better come clean to her right away . Got it ? Go now ! Tell the truth . You must tell her the truth . Hey ! Come back . What 's her name again ? Invite her to my concert . Let 's chat in the evening . I 'm busy right now . Mr Dong . I have a new idea for Lotto . Have a look . This ... Since you came to our company , you brought us lots of new ideas . I like our team , and I work very well with Mr Sun . However , the market is very bad right now . Our company is still short of capital . We had a board meeting yesterday . We need to cut some of our high salaried staffs . Mr Dong . What do you mean ? I mean ... We have 2 creative directors in this company . I 'm the executive creative director . I know . In a company of our scale only one creative director is enough . Look . You were hired by me . I need to set an example for the board 's decision . Sun is almost our founding member . He would have to stay . Therefore ... I understand . This is the board 's decision , not mine . Don 't worry , Mr Dong . I 've been working here for quite some time but I never had a break . It 's time I took a vacation . When we 're listed one day , I 'll hire you back . Good , I 'm looking forward to that day . I 'll get going , Mr Dong . How can I survive without Sichuan food abroad ? I 'll call you back in a bit . Can I have a word with you ? Good timing . I 'm looking for you . You managed to win Lotto over . I 'm so proud of you . I confess hiring Ly Yilong was a mistake . Effective today , you 'll be our ECD . The company still relies on us old fogies . What about Yilong ? She 's gone . She 's quite tactful . Said she 's not used to here . What kind of boss are you ? I 'm still not quite sure about this . It happened so suddenly . Don 't worry . It might be a blessing in disguise . Already 3 Shanghai companies want to see you . Let 's talk when I arrive this afternoon . See you in the evening . Yilong ? It 's your ex-wife ! Back from honeymoon ? What 's with Doudou ? She called me 3 times . She 's in a bad mood and the phone hung up . What 's going on ? Are you supposed to take her to Erdong 's birthday party ? That 's right . Baby , are you OK ? Doudou ? Where 's Doudou ? Did you piss her off ? Your daughter is too immature . She wouldn 't let me touch her . Hey man , aren 't you a womanizer ? Teach me a trick or two . Be good , young man . I 'm been looking madly for you . Let 's chat . You got booze ? Yes . My dad has a concert . He wants you to go with me . Thank you . You 're really leaving ? You want me to stay ? I got something to explain to you . The rock ' n roll bride is your idea . Lotto 's is also yours . I stole your creative ideas . Listen ... You can hear my thoughts ? I can . Are you done with lying ? It 's true . He 's making me confused . I 'm making you confused . What kind of person is he really ? I 'm a jerk . I 'm not what you think . I understand . Since I was little , I 've felt that I 'm a smart person . Everybody says I 'm smart . But now , I feel I 'm especially stupid . Can you forgive me ? Let 's start over . Don 't go . Are you done ? You better go . If you don 't go , I 'll go . Sir ! Sir ! He was just struck by lightning . So amazing . He 's perfectly all right ! It 's gone . Sir , are you all right ? I 'm fine ... Are you alright ? I 'm fine . We should go , we might miss our flight . OK . Peter . Still thinking of her ? No . I wonder whether Grandpa can sing that High C. Can I sit here ? The seat was reserved for you . I 'm proud of you . Good . Can you still hear my thoughts ? Tell me . Anyway , you 're not leaving . Mr Sun Morning Morning , Mr Sun Hello , Mr Sun ? Hello . Mr Sun 300MB united TEAM - sunmenghao

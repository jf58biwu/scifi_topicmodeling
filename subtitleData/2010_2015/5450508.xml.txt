 You are special ... unique ... and real . Ouch ! - Mom ! It 's for you ! - What is this ? - Oh God ! - Grandpa ! What I want to know is why he has done this . Maybe there 's something he wants to say . - I know nothing about the code . - If we find David 's clone ... - ... the code can be re-created . - David 's mother called sometimes . - His mother 's still alive . - Beatrice should not be here ! I will restart you in 12 hours . I did not find the battery . The model is no longer manufactured . - Even similar models ? - Eight years ago , it was common . I have a special order . - What size do you want ? - Not that . This is something else . Tell me what you want , I 'll find it for you . When you go into the operating system , the symbol appears . Can you get one of those ? - I can keep my eyes open . - This customer pays damn good . - How good ? - You never have to work again . Excuse me . Do you know Flash ? Excuse me . Do you know Flash ? Excuse me . Do you know Flash ? - Excuse me . Do you know Flash ? - No , sorry . Excuse me . Do you know Flash ? - They do not know Flash . - What do you think of my eyes ? - Do you think they are too green ? - We have to find Flash ! HubSec ! - My mirror ! - Leave it ! Marylyn ! Hub-check ! Inspection . Stand still ! - Stop ! Stand still . Stand still ! Why are we discussing HubSec ? HubSec is not the problem . They are neutralizing the virus-infected hubots that have become a safety hazard . What we need to talk about are hubots . Hubots are the problem . Einar Hultgren from Transhumanist Youths . You are opposed to HubSec . Why ? Yes . HubSec is a fascist paramilitary organization that is sanctioned ... - ... by the government . - We have to get rid of killing machines ! The trojan virus is the problem . The important thing is to find its creator . We are criminalizing the victims . It only creates unnecessary suffering . - Have you been there long ? - Victims are the people who are affected . You can choose the color of your eyes . It costs money . We need our money to recharge . No ! That 's not right . Here . KNOCK May I come in ? - Don 't you sleep like the others ? - Nah . They have things to do tomorrow . I can sleep whenever I want . Huh ? Is it the virus ? - Do not look at those things . - Why not ? It 's something that some idiot uploaded . I am a child of David . - What did you say ? - Sorry ? - You just said something ... - " Why not ? " - After that . - I said nothing after . Before we end , we would like to remind all hubot owners to only download updates from safe sources . Good evening . Marylyn ! Marylyn . How do I look ? Hey , Mimi behaved strangely yesterday . - How so ? - She was not herself . - We talked about the virus ... - Then she certainly felt uncomfortable . Tobbe ! Wait there . We 're going to talk about something in a bit . Mimi ! - Have you spoken with the job coach ? - About a new job ? - Don 't you want to ? - I might consider other options . - So what is it ? - Right . - I want everyone at home tonight . - Are you getting a divorce ? - No , honey . - What for , then ? - We 'll start grandfather . - Yey ! - Cool . - Why do it ? - I like hubots . - I like hubots , too . - We know , sweetheart . - Start Grandpa ! I want us to do it together . I want everyone to be home for it . Come , Mimi . The provisions for the technology patents is left . The major patents have been agreed on , but PJH has millions of patents ... - ... they are just sitting on . - This is my tennis partner and son Douglas . Right , what 's left to do ? Proofread the text of the proposal , send it to PJH , and wait for counter-offers . - I can do it . - Yes , give it to ... - Magnus . - I thought that maybe Mimi could do it . - Your hubot ? - She finds inconsistencies in the text . She can also handle the negotiations ; give all the opposition happy endings . You 're an expert on that . Inger , I think it sounds great . That 's settled . Call if there is anything . But don 't call . Inger make sure that it goes properly . It will go great . Hey , when do we meet Florentine ? Uh ... no , she won 't come . It 's just you and me . Right , yes . So the young lady has other plans . How disappointing . - How good are you ? Can you handle three sets ? - I am trying to compliment you . - She 's a lovely woman . I like her . - It 's over . We are not together . What are you saying ? Seriously ? - Why are you doing nothing ? - There are no customers . The containers need to be scrubbed . - You can do that . - I can not . I am stuck . You missed a spot . - Where ? - Left . Left . Left . Left . Left . Lower . Lower . Lower . Left . Lower . Lower . Lower . Damn it . That spot ? Perfect . What the hell are you up to ? Oops . Sorry . F * * * idiot ! Have you seen Inger ? - Do I look like a secretarial-hub ? - Excuse me . You know what that is , right ? That contract . It is for a subcontractor to Hub Max . They make software for sex dolls . - Like you . - Can I get my papers ? Can I get a kiss ? - What did you want with Inger ? - Proofs are ready . - Well ? - I found 17 inconsistencies . - What should I do now ? - What were you told to do ? To find inconsistencies in the text , and then send it to PJH . Do it , then . Send it with the 17 inconsistencies ? Were you told to correct them ? Right . Be a good doll now . So . - Is it time for exercise again ? - I need information . - What do you want to know ? - Will Lennart be really back ? Yes , yes . Will he be himself ? You know , if you are the first thing they see when they wake up ... - ... they remember you forever . - It 's a machine ! It remembers everything . - Machine ? It 's your Grandpa ! - It 's not , really . It 's a copy . Fat chance that we could afford one of these . We should not start it ! Mom would be mad . - God , how cool . - He looks so much smaller . Nonsense . It 's an Atsugi Robotics ; an exact copy . Hello , what are you doing ? - Just looking at it . - Mom will be pissed off if he is started . We 're not going to start him . We 're just looking . Tobbe ! That 's not why we are here . - Betty wants to talk to you about something . - What now ? - Are you ashamed that you are THS ? - I don 't want to talk about it with you . You know , " walls keep people out , but they also keep you in . " Would you like to meet someone ? So , who broke it off ? - Can we talk about something else ? - No , I 'm worried about you . I want to know . - Was it Florentine ? Had you done something stupid ? - No ? It was not her who broke it off , then . Nothing ? You won 't try to explain ? She was an amazing girl . It 's been a long time since I saw you so happy , Douglas . She 's not what I thought she was . No ? Given your previous women maybe it is something positive . But Douglas , I just don 't want you to be alone . Do you understand ? I am not alone . I am not alone . - What is it ? - Open the door ! Open the door ! - You have not paid the bill . - I had no time to collect the money . - Pay or else I throw you out . - I have no money right now ! - No , I do not pay that way . - It was the necklace I was looking at . Then I will call my friends . You would not like them , I promise . But they will definitely like you . - You 've been here long . You need to pay the rest . - I have no more . How sad . In that case , start packing . - Come on ! - Must recharge . - We just recharged . - Must recharge . We just recharged . Come . - You are very hot . - Must recharge . - You shouldn 't be this hot . - Must re ... I 'm going to turn you off . You need to cool down . Must recharge . Must re ... - Gordon . - It is not possible to turn you off . If I have the virus I must be purged . Wait here . I 'm going to find help . - You know what you have to do . - What are you talking about ? Destroy my brain , so that it will not be found . - It will not be needed . - Tell me you will destroy my brain ! Say it ! I will destroy your brain . I will be back soon . Silas ! Hello ? Silas ? Hello ! Silas ? Hello ? Is there anyone there ? Hello ? Hello , is there anyone here ? Hello ? My mask ! My mask ! Oh , sorry ! - What do you want ? - I 'm looking for Silas . - He is not here ! - I see that . Sorry . I will leave . I 'm sorry . Have I permitted you to go down there ? Did I ? You do not go down there ! - Damn it ! - I was looking for you . - Odi , is he completely healthy ? - Is it Odi 's fault that you went down there ? Don 't go down there ! How hard is it to understand ? - Who was that ? - Who ? He 's down there . - The owner . - Oh , hell . His job is different , we do not interfere with it . - What happened to him ? - Do you remember the hubot haters ? The blast in Hub Market ? No . Or well , maybe . I read about it . He owned the place . He was there when it happened . They should reinstate the death penalty . Lucky for them that they got busted . Maybe put a bounty on their heads . Yeah , those bastards . What was it you wanted to talk about ? About Odi ? Oh , it was nothing . - Well , a container must be scrubbed . - Let the hubs do it . It 's cool out , I need fresh air . - Roger ! - Yes ? You 'll fit in well here , I think . KNOCK Come in . Are you Jonas ? My name is Jonas . GROANS and MOANS Yes , here we have it . Welcome . Make yourselves at home . Tea ? Energy drink ? Can I get you something . Oops . - Tea is good , thank you . - And Matilda ? - Tea will be fine . - There are candies , that are quite old . Eat it at your own risk . - Should I take the cups ? - You can take them . Do you know who that is ? David Eischer . The woman is his wife Beatrice . The boy named Leo . They 're not alive anymore . - Sorry . I 'm being impolite . Einar . - Tobbe . - Are you THS ? - Did Betty say that ? - Nah . - How did you know ? - A feeling I just got . - You can see it on people ? - Hi . - Hi . - This is Matilda , Tobias ' sister . - Hi , Einar . Do you know the combination ? No . - Only Greta knows . - Have you seen what 's in there ? No . How many hubots are in the apartment ? - Three . - Where is the third ? In the safe . You know what 's in there ? I said I haven 't seen what 's in there . Clott ! Clott ! - Clott ! - I 'm here . This phone does not work ! I hit the numbers several times , but no signal ! - This is a remote control . - I know , but how do I make a call ? Who will Greta call ? I do not know . - Maybe Greta should lie in bed . - Maybe . Maybe . - Is she always so confused ? - It varies . Sometimes she 's normal . - When is she normal ? - When she gets her shot . Marylyn ! Marylyn ? Marylyn ? Marylyn ! Marylyn ! GROANS Marylyn ! Marylyn . Gordon . - I found no help . - You have to end me . You must . We are children of David . You promised . Do it . Eischer was the first to have a hubot . Among us transhumans many say that he was the first THS person . It was long before we had a name . - But he had family . - Many have a wife and children . Or husband and children , for that matter . You should never lie about who you are . It only creates suffering . There 's a rumor ... He is said to have created a code that can unlock hubots , give them their own volition . It is the Holy Grail for all . Whoever gets hold of such a code would be able to change the world . Forever . It is time for Greta 's shot now . There . Now Greta just rest . Greta ! - Beatrice ! Are you visiting David ? - David doesn 't live here anymore . - Does he not ? - We 've moved . Leo has a garden . Hm , Leo ... David asked me to get his birth certificate from the safe . Oh well , yes . - Do you remember the code ? - Sure , it 's clear . I 'm not really ... I wonder if I didn 't put the certificate in the kitchen drawer . We already did that . Now we are looking here . - Where 's David ? - Look in the safe . - No looking ! - No . But David 's dead ... - Excuse me ? - Beatrice is also ... Cloette ! Stop her ! - Come on now , Greta . - Yes , but ... David is dead ! What is she doing ? Inger ! Come in here . - What is happening ? - Your hubot ... - Mimi It has sent the uncorrected draft to PJH . - Why did you ? - I would find the inconsistencies ... - ... and then send the text to the PJH . - Not before it was corrected ! There goes our credibility . - You should have talked to me . - You were not here . - You could have waited . - Magnus told me to do it . - You gave the instructions , not me . - It contains policies concerning employees . - If we become liable ... - Hire her ! - What did you say ? - Hire her . I just read her suggestions and ... Sorry . Was it Mimi ? - Yes . - Like the mouse . I am just now reading her proposed changes . She found loopholes in the wording that I thought were watertight . - You can not employ it ! - Why not ? We have a vacancy . - Huh ? - You have deliberately sabotaged a deal worth millions . Better luck somewhere else . - Claes , wait . - For what ? - That 's a hubot ! - Thank you , that 's enough . You can go now . - What if they read the draft ? - We would have heard by now . - They may sharpen the knives . - May I ask Mimi ... - To whom did you address the document ? - To PJH , as you said . Did you write " Attention " for a specific person ? Then it is still in reception . Ask them to send it back . Henning , could you ... and you too . Please leave the room . I need to speak to Inger privately . I 'm sorry . - Never again . I 'll leave Mimi home . - Why does everyone think I 'm joking ? I want to hire her ! Where did you find a hubot with this capability ? Well , it ... Hans . It is my husband who is ... - Yes , he 's a bit handy . - So they can 't be bought like that ? - It might not be quite legal . - Shh ! Say no more ! Henning ! Write a contract for Mimi , immediately . - Is it understood ? - Okay . Good . I am looking for the owner of a hubot . It is a 400 TwinX . A female . I know that it is not manufactured for the Swedish market , but maybe something similar . Okay , but somebody might have imported it for their own use . There is nothing registered ? No , no . Just ... Thank You . Thanks ... Darling , what are you doing ? - He needs somewhere to stay . - He ? Dad . Tobias and Matilda are here now . We can have them help . - Can I get ... fix the ... - Do you want to do it in the morning ? Yeah , but then ... right , we carry him inside . - Let 's just start him . - I won 't start dad in a garage ! It 's not your father ! Tobbe ... Tobbe ! HANS HUMMING - What are you doing ? - Nothing . Mom said you needed help . Yes . And so ... If we set the ... - Oh no , Tobbe ! - Be careful with Grandpa ! Slide over here a bit . - How do we do this , then ? - Mimi must be here . I 'm here . All of us are here . Inger ! Tobias . - And Matilda ! - Hi . Hi , Grandpa . Sofia . What fun to see you ! I 've missed you so much . Hi , Lennart . Who are you ? Hans . - We know each other ? - I 'm married to Inger . How strange . I should know who you are . Yes . Inger , are you married to him ? Excuse me . Florentine ! Floren ... Florentine ! It is Douglas . Are you in there ? Please ... Hey ! Please answer me ! I miss you . Douglas . - Douglas ! - I was ... I got confused . Please ! I 'm sorry . Florentine , can you answer me ! I hear you there . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . You 'll never have to see me again . Okay , then ... Then I 'll go . I 'll go . What have you done ? How are you ? Fine . I can turn it off if you want . I 'll pack it all up and drive it to the recycling in the morning . I don 't mind doing it . I 'm sorry ... It was just a bit much . He sits in the living room if you want to talk to him . I 'll tuck Sofia in . - Do you not recognize me ? - You 're a hubot . - I am your hubot ! - No , Odi is my hubot . I don 't know who you are . Inger ... Vera , can we be alone for a bit ? - This is difficult for me . - What is difficult ? That you are here . - That you are a clone . - A what ? A clone . - Don 't you know that you are a clone ? - No . I 'm sorry if it sounds harsh , but there is no point in pretending . Okay . Do you have a message for me ? Yes . I love you . Huh ? I am not good at telling you , but now you should know . I am proud of you and all that you have accomplished . You are a good person and a better daughter than I had the right to ask for . Have I made you sad ? I love you too . - Douglas . - Florentine . Hey . What are you doing here ? I came to take you home . Home to me , home to us . - I will never leave you again . - I love you . Would you marry me ? Yes . Gladly . Excuse me . Excuse me . We are closed . I have to ask you to go . Gordon ! Hi . You had your shot today . Do you know what happens when you overdose ? Clott ! Help ... Scream again and I will kill you . Understand ? What have you done with David 's clone ? - David died . I buried him . - His clone ! It is in the grave . The doll is in the grave . - What are you ? - I am a child of David .

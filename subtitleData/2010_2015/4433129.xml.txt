 IJON TICHY - SPACE PILOT The Star Diaries Freely produced by themes from the novel " Star diaries " by Stanislaw Lem Cruising on Monday , October 3rd ... with my stomach still empty I was on my way to the Egg Planet . I should 've done the shortcut . If I don 't do it , it 's not any good . Only I do things right . You 're so modest , Mr. Tichy . Where should I hang this ? Here ? A little higher . - What 's that ? Every doctor , lawyer or cosmic hero needs to display a diploma on the wall . But not that silly photo . Holy crap ! I don 't need it . The whole cosmos knows the name : Ijon Tichy . Of course . Ijon Tichy , a name people remember . Ihjon Fishy ? Holy Crap ! Got it . Watch out ! - Sorry . It might be breakable ! Tarantoga has finally invented something again . It 's addressed to Mel , c / o Ihjon Fishy . Mr. Fishy , I 'd better hang it up . What ? What 's that ? Poor thing ! Mr. Tichy , isn 't that your flashlight ? Yes , but how 's that possible ? Hello Mel ? Mr. Fishy ? Tichy , Ijon Tichy ! Has my Befast-Fix finally arrived ? - What 's this cheap stuff ? Watch out ! Don 't shake the bottle ! It can have devastating consequences ! Don 't tell me you shook it ? Naw , I didn 't shake it up . Is everything ok there ? - Yes , yes . Mel , it 's time for the annual Interstellular Praefectus . A meeting of top scientists dealing with time travel and fate manipulation . This Befast-Fix is my newest invention and , Mel , I want you to present it ! You 're not flying down yourself ? No , I 'll leave the fame and glory to you . Soon everyone will know your name . What ? - What now ? You 're not far ! They have a great buffet ! I really can 't make it this time . What 's it gonna be : Yes or No ? SAY NO ! I 'd like to , but ... Ok , we 'll swing by . Bye-bye . What 's that ? Not important . Let 's get rid of it . SAY NO ! BEFAST-FIX CRONOBUBBLES Iths here thomewhere ... Holy crap ... Hey , what 's that ? - Got it ... You jackass . - What ? If you were less pleathed with yourself , you could have figured out my note . Don 't insult me ! Where did you come from ? It 's usthless ! I 'll do it mysthelf ! I was familiar with the cosmic effects of duplication ... I knew that the double was usually a dumb-twit . You egomanic jackass . You 're gonna ruin the name Ijon Tichy in the whole cosmos . It was dangerous ! I have to prevent it . This is my rocket . I 'm in charge . Ouch ! I 'd like to know where he came from , though . Loudmouth can tell us later . Now 's it time for fame and glory . Freshly ironed pants ... are half the battle . Freshly ironed pants ... are half the battle . My achy head . Why am I here again ? You tell me ! I can 't remember . Out of my bed . - Why me ? Ith 's my bed . Get lost ! Tomorrow I have to present my great invention . I need my sleep . But I 'm supposed to present the great ... - Your great inventhion ? You 're joking . But ok , then ith 's my great inventhion too . Silly jackass . Next morning , I thought it was a bad dream . Until I saw he had stolen ... my fresh pants ! Move over . I 'm presenting my inventhion . I need to look good . Hey , thleepyhead . You can 't go in those panths . - What ? Freshly ironed panths are half the battle . Forget the pants . No bottle , no presentation . I 'll do it . Mr. Tichy , we 've no idea how this stuff works ! With my brains and your help , we 'll manage . These snow Kulups stink the same every year . Mel , you left-handed klutz ! Oh , that 's Ignor von Rant , the Dean of the Interstellular Praefectus ! Hello . - Where 's Professor Tarantoga ? I 'm Ijon Tichy , I 'm representing this Tarantoga guy . Who ? Iljon Flushy ? Tarantoga , that old sissy 's scared to leave the house . Arm gone , genius gone . These are last year 's exhibits . The winners ! I was a little surprised : Tarantoga , that dumb-twit , won every year . What 's this ? This here is the Planet Brake ! Planet Brake ? The break is my invention ! And this is the bill for infinite sums of money . I came up with the sideways eight . And here un-lightable matches for kids . For safety reasons . You were here every year . But only Tarantoga 's on the photos . Oh no , I 'm there on every photo . Tarantoga is just blocking me a bit . I 'm particularly proud of this ... My latest invention ... Now I will turn on the time loop . It goes back and forth in time . For this I obviously deserve first prize today ... Boring ... I want to go to the buffet . Mr. Tichy ? Mr. Tichy ! We need to find our stand , we 're up soon . Ladies , Gents , Extraterrestrials , I 'd like to demonstrate my Mopedonator . I need someone to volunteer ... What did this dumb-twit think would happen when they saw us both ? ... an object which I can shoot into the past . Don 't worry , it 's safe . No broken window . I don 'th believe thath . This I 'd like to see ... So kind of you . Now I 'll take the flashlight from ... Tiffy , Ijon Tiffy . ... from Mr. Tiffy and shoot it into the past . Watch out ! This flashlight is really in the past ? Precisely . - Astonishing . He wins ! Why do you need a machine that goesth into the past ... if it does 'nth come back ? - What ? Thilly crap ! - Frankly , I thought of that too . Third place ! It 's called " time travel " and not " back-and-forth-travel " ... Why are we even listening to this loser ! What 's your name again ? Iljon Flutschy ? Ijon Tiffy . This Modeponator here , it works . Do you remember ? The flashlight ... it flew through our windshield yesterday ! That 's right . This toothless loudmouth has no idea ... Hey , what ? It 's my moment here not yours . But that fat worm wrote down my name . Your name is my name , which you are dragging through the mud ! At least give me a bite of that ... - Get your own thsandwitch , freeloader ! It 's our turn . I 'm going . Mr. Chippy , please start . I still didn 't know how it worked ... so I had to improvise . Good-day , I 'm Ijon Tichy ... and I 'll show you a breakthrough in time travel ... Boring ! With this liquid fluid you can blow a bubble ... that " is completely outside of a cosmetic " ... No ... " cosmic time flow process " . That way you can travel in the bubble ... for " any amount of time into the future " . Yes , into the future . Shake once for one minute . Twice for one hour . Three times for one day . And so on . - Yeah , right ! I will now shake this twice . Now , I 'll send someone into the future for one hour . Yes , exactly . - Mel , off you go ! What ? - There you go . Wow ! I saw everything outside the bubble accelerated . For me it was just a second ! This is the proof . And it goes on infinitely , if you shake it up a lot . This made me think of the Halucinette in the bubble . I knew that I had really shaken up the bottle . Poor Hallucinette ... the package ... Mr. Ilija Tiffy , how do you get back into the past ... if you are sent to the future ? You said yourself ... one direction was not enough ! Ok . Boring , let 's leave . Mr. Rant , perhaps we could discus my score again ... What ? You losther , you 're ruining my moment of fame and glory . I 'm fed up , now give me that sandwich . Hey , I have an idea ! We just need to combine Tarantoga 's Future Befast-Fix ... with the Mopedonator , which sends things , like the flashlight , into the past . Then we 'd have a gadget that works in both directions . A time machine ! Do you think it 'll work ? We could sneak in at night ... and swipe the parts from the others ... Did you take those parts without asking ? You dirty-dog-of-a-thief . - No , you 're the dirty-dog-of-a-sthief ! They 'll notice we stole all this . But when they see we 've made a real time machine , they 'll be so impressed . What are you hiding ? Nothing ! You wanna stop me from controlling the time travel machine later . What you are talking about ? Do you think I 'm as dumb as a doornail ! Just a few more adjustments . Look at that . Ith 's an important part for the chroncycle . How did it get there ? - You threw it there . I saw you . You 're as dim as a lighths out . Look what you did to her . Mr. Tichy , it 's done ! Isn 't it wonderful ? Whath 's this ? It 'll never work . Dumb-twit . Hello , dumb-twit ! Mr. Tichy , to the right ! Mr. Tichy ! This photo has a good chance of landing on the Wall of Fame ! Sure , I had a great invention . Higher , so we can read it ! Mr. Slobby , you can 't take a photo ... without doing a presentation first . Please start . This ... is a real chroncycle time travel machine . Good morning Mr. Tushy , Fishy or whatever ! How did the presentation go ? Did you mention my name often enough ? What ? It 's freezing out here , you idiot . That 's a real time machine invented by me : Ijon Tichy . You thief , that 's a part from my Mopedonator ! It 's been missing since last evening . - Yeah , a part of my swivel chair . What 's his name again ? Ijon Tichy . I 'll remember that . Ballpoint pen attack ! I was trapped ! If I couldn 't break through a door ... I had to break through time ! I had the machine for it ! You imposthor ! You stole my fame and glory . You want fame and glory ? Be my guest , it 's yours ! It worked . My inventhion . Ijon Tichy . Get him ! Hello ? It really worked ! A time travel machine . But I didn 't know the time I was traveling to . When I noticed what time I had landed in ... I was shocked . Holy crap . I had changed roles . You 're not flying down yourself ? No , I 'll leave the fame and glory to you . Soon everyone will know your name . I was worried this would shame the name Ijon Tichy . I had to stop it . I would send a secret message to myself . SAY NO ! So , what 's it gonna be : Yes or No ? INVENTOR OF THE TIMEMACHINE Ok , we 'll ... swing by . The photo , how stupid of me ! Now I had a problem . I was in a time loop ... without noticing it . What ? - I have to do it all mysthelf ! I have to prevent it . Now it 's time for fame and glory ! SAY NO ! Let 's get rid of it . 1020 years later Naw , I didn 't shake it up ! Mr. Fishy ? It 's not far . What 's it gonna be : Yes or No ? Say no , Tichy ! Don 't call me Tichy . It 's Mr. Tichy to you ! Do you ever think of anyone but yourself ? I 'm the boss . I demand respect . Respect ? It 's pointless . If you only knew what I know . I think , you need a few lessons ... in modesty . Stop laughing . Later , people said I made the whole thing up . Nasty people said ... that I secretly drank too much alcohol on earth ... but lost all inhibitions on long space voyages ... Impossible . - The photo ? I found it under the control panel . This photo can 't exist ! You 're just jealous . God knows how this rumor got started . People are like that . They 'd rather believe a bunch of silly crap than perfectly good facts . I 'm on the photo .

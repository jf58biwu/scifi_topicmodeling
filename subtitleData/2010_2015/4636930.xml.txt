 Go ! Run , idiots ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Some of these expenses look really high . Travel , this meal budget ? Well , that 's mostly takeout . Takeout doesn 't mean on-budget . Though I will say this looks pretty tasty . It is . It 's from the little Moroccan place around the corner . I 'd go easy on that sauce . It 's sort of pretty spicy . Thanks for the warning . It 's called harissa . The first time I experienced it was in the Hotel Saint George in Algiers . It was so hot , just a few drops rendered the entire meal practically inedible . I love the harissa at the Saint George . You 've been to the Saint George ? Don 't look so surprised . What did you think I was ? Just some faceless pencil pusher ? No , I just wouldn 't expect what you do to allow you much time to world travel . Yeah , well , I was an army brat so I grew up in some very strange places . Pakistan , Philippines , Bolivia . And I still like to go native when I get the chance . I like to veer off the beaten path myself . There 's lessons in thinking outside the box . When I hiked across Borneo , they told me to stick to the map . I threw it away after 15 minutes . That was probably stupid . Well , clearly , I put you in the wrong box . Well , you 're a psychiatrist . You 're not supposed to do that . Well , the doctor 's not in just now , but I 'm delighted to have been proven wrong . Gotta love the high hopes of New York sports fans . But this is a team that just can 't seem to catch a break . And they 're looking at tough road games ... I spoke with Cheryl this morning . I mean , can you believe these guys ? They play no defense , no offense , why am I still a fan ? She told me some really big news . She 's pregnant . That 's good , right ? Yeah . For her , it is . Jeannie ... You told me you wanted kids , Bill . You know that 's a very big decision , right ? So what , you 've changed your mind ? No , that 's not what I said . But ... We 've been thinking about this for years . We don 't have forever . I don 't have forever . Jeannie . Jeannie . Gary 's sick ? What 's he got ? It 's that flu that 's going around , I think . I could come by and take a look at him if you 'd like . No . It 's ... It 's nothing serious . He 's gonna have to stay home though . Well , just tell him we hope he feels better and that we 're gonna miss him . Yeah . Goodbye . I want to go to work . You can 't . Dr. Rosen says you have the day off . No . I have to put my lunch in the refrigerator , and then I have to greet my co-workers appropriately and then ... Then ... Then I have my morning therapy session . Gary , not today . Please . That 's cute . Trying to fix it ? This thing burns my toast every time . Turn my back for a second and it 's charred . You know you can buy another one for , like , 20 bucks . I fix lots of things . Thanks . Men and their tools . You 'll see . Perfect toast every time . Nina , can I see you ? So you and Cameron , is something going on ? Flirtations . Did Rachel say something ? No . I 'm ... I 'm sure it 's perfectly innocent . I just want to make sure it stays that way . It 's nothing . Good . Hello , Kathy , yes . Good morning . I thought you might find this interesting . A beautiful little piece of toast , golden brown , perfect little crust , just like I said it was gonna be . Agent Sullivan just called . Apparently , we have an Alpha missing . Skylar Adams . Someone is smarter than me . Skylar 's smarter than just about anyone . She was always inventing things even when we met her . That 's her special ability . Creating things people have never seen before . Taking things apart , putting them together . Yeah , well , she should have learned to invent a better door , I 'll tell you that much . Five tactical assault boots . And some blood , but not a lot . Two wounded , but not fatally . The question is , who the hell were they ? Whoever they were , she was ready . Kept a prototype in this cabinet and had the entire thing ready to blow . Bad guys coming through the front door , she 's out that window in 10 seconds . She was always good at getting herself out of sticky situations . She 's what you call your classic catch and release Alpha , huh ? The usual tests and interviews , posed no threat to society , so back to the wild . So you guys were friends ? Skylar never really had friends . She was always more interested in things than people . So when was the last time you spoke to her ? We haven 't spoken in years . All right . Don 't worry . We 're going to find her . Before those tactical boots do . Bill , I think I found something . Skylar Adams ? Yeah , Skylar Adams . No . Doesn 't ring a bell . Yeah , well , she buys your customized parts . Well , many people do . Well , we have reason to believe that she might be in trouble . Well , I 'm sure she might be , with people like you chasing her down . We 're trying to help her . You 're from the government . You don 't want to help her . You know , you want to control her . You want to control everyone , anybody who doesn 't abide by your rules . Rachel . Look at this . Or cuts up their credit cards . Who won 't buy your mass-produced garbage . You hate the government so much ? You might want to step into that . Let me see you try and survive one day without the government . Of course you think that . They want you to . They trained you to in their schools , and the corporate-run media , it is all part of the plan ... Yeah , got the message . Down with the Man . Now be a sweetheart , and tell us exactly where we can find Skylar Adams . She stopped by last night looking to sell off some of her work . She needed to make some extra cash . Said she was meeting a buyer at the Brooklyn Heights farmers ' market . All right , come on , let 's go . You got the money ? You got the product ? So just 10 minutes a night ? You 'll feel like you slept eight hours . Satisfaction guaranteed . I 'm in kind of a hurry . - Needle in a haystack . - Yeah . I hear something . Footsteps running , female . Three men in pursuit . Assault boots . This way . Okay , let 's split up . Dr. Rosen , go get the car . Nina , with me . We 'll cut them off at the exit . Hey , man , watch out ! What is that ? Whoa ! Hicks , here . Hold it right there ! - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Everyone in ? You were following me ? Skylar , for some reason , I thought you 'd be more pleased to see me . Gum ? You promised you 'd leave me alone . We have left you alone . For five years . We heard that you were in trouble , that you 'd been attacked . It 's nothing I can 't handle . You blew up your apartment . These people who are after you , who are they ? Skylar , you have to have some idea . I make things , people like them . They make an offer , I turn them down . They tend to get upset . Sound familiar ? Yes , it does . Yes , I made you an offer . I wanted you to work with me , but I wasn 't upset when you said no . I respected your decision . What do you want from me ? Skylar , you 're in danger , right ? That 's why we brought you here . Where you 'd be safe . We want to help you . But in order to do that , we need to know the truth , who these people are who are after you and how do they keep finding you ? Well , I told you . I have no idea . Skylar , who are you talking to ? Look at your hands , the way you 're sitting . I know you 're holding something back . Right ? This is the part where you push me , right ? Skylar ... No . We 're on your side . No one is going to make you do anything against your will . So then , I guess I 'm free to go ? Well , there 's a few things we need to tend to first . You know , you might want to take it easy on this thing , especially with our guest over there . I think she 's on their side . Thanks . Yeah . That was one hell of a bottle toss you threw today , man . Yeah , yeah , think I pulled something . Your son , he plays baseball too ? Tyler , oh , yeah . How 's his arm ? Well , not like mine . Then again , you know , I didn 't really notice anything special until I was in high school , so ... So , he 's , um , just a normal kid , like ... Yeah , I mean , he 's not Iike you and me if that 's what you mean . Why are you asking ? Just ... I don 't know , I was just curious . That 's all . Just wondering . Gary , lunch . It 's Monday . I have my lunch in the break room . On Mondays I usually do the shipping invoices , but not today . Everyone else is at work , except me . And Dr. Rosen never said that I had a day off . You lied to me . Yeah , you lied to me . And Dr. Rosen lied to me for a long time . You 're not working there anymore . I have to . That 's my job . Well , you 've got another job . Yeah , I talked to Uncle Alan . He said he has a position for you in data entry . I don 't work for Uncle Alan . I work for Dr. Rosen . Well , it 's ... It 's not safe for you , Gary . That ... That stuff that I told you , that 's top secret . And I wasn 't even supposed to tell you . Well , you did tell me and I 'm not gonna let him endanger you ever again ! No ... End of story ! No , it 's not . You can 't ... Look , I 'm an adult . And you can 't tell me what to do . I make ... I make my own life choices . Not this time , you don 't , kiddo . Yeah , I ... Yeah , get out . Gary ! I said get out ! Couple more tweaks , you could probably turn that into a time machine . I already did . I 'm visiting you from the future . Yeah , but the future you would have even more tattoos . You have a lot more since the last time I saw you . And you are still a blank canvas . That time we went bar-hopping in Soho . That 's the closest I ever got . One more cosmopolitan and you would 've got that devil on your thigh . And a lifetime of regret . How much longer am I gonna be in here ? Nice work , Lee . Well , we 're not quite finished and I don 't think it would be a good idea to let her go until we know who 's after her . I have no intention of releasing her . Clay 's on his way to collect her right now . Clay ? When did you decide to bring Clay in on this ? Hours ago , Lee . He should be here any minute . Skylar , you can trust me . You can trust Rosen . Just tell us who 's after you . Rosen is a government flunkie . You all are . He 's in his office with them right now taking orders . Rosen 's no pushover . Believe me . Yeah . I 'm sure that 's what he tells himself . But he 's part of the system , and so are you . You know that better than me . Her abilities are extremely valuable , Lee . If we don 't take her , someone else will . Someone else is already trying to . No , I 'm aware of that . But ... Hmm . If you don 't mind me asking , what do you intend to do with her ? Place her in protective custody , where she 'll be free to develop her technology , and be compensated very generously . Do you really think Skylar is gonna go along with that ? It 's not her choice . It 's not ours either . Well , whose choice is it then ? There 's a chain of command that we all have to follow . Well , what happened to the woman who throws away the map ? Hmm ? And forges her own path . That 's on vacation , Lee . This is work . Did you really think some takeout Moroccan was gonna change all that ? You guys get this text ? There 's men coming up here with guns . How many we got ? - What 's going on ? - No idea . Three men heading to the elevators . Assault boots . Get in here now . How do they know where she is ? It 's on the security cameras . I don 't know . Don 't move ! Clay , where are you ? I need you here now . Let 's go ! Look alive . There they are . Same guys from the marketplace . DOD ! Stand down ! Stand down ! Lay on the ground now ! I said stand down , damn it ! DOD . NSA ! NSA ? What the hell are you guys doing here ? What a mess . I gotta get out there . Wait . Hold on . That 's Skylar . What is that ? - I don 't know . She 's getting out of here . Later , flunkies ! Thank you so much , Alan . You know what ? He can start whenever you want him to , and I will carpool him from work . How 's that ? Yeah , you know what ? And I 'm also going to send you a list of things he needs because he 's very particular . This ringing in my ear just won 't stop . Well , Sullivan 's got it worse than you do and now she 's at the NSA , dealing with this bureaucratic meltdown . I don 't envy her . Rachel , I thought you 'd have a coma or something . Yeah , well , I shut everything down except for my sense of taste the minute Skylar set this thing off . It 's a stun device using sound and light . All these components were taken from things right here in our offices . Nina 's tablet , even wires from our surveillance cameras . What ? She constructed this thing right under our noses . Yeah , and in under 10 minutes , no less . That is some serious talent . Yeah , I thought she was a friendly . What happened to that ? She was . Until Clay showed up with his goons . I mean , of course she took off . What do you expect ? A little appreciation . We did save her ass . You promised her this wouldn 't happen . Yes , Nina , and I did everything I could do to fulfill it . But she ... So what ? What , we ship her off to Binghamton ? Let them do experiments on her and turn her into some psychopath like Marcus Ayers ? She harmed federal agents . In self-defense . All right , this was not self-defense . This is not up to us , Nina . You know , she 's right . We do exactly what they tell us to . We 're flunkies . Queens . But you can 't take any streets starting with the letters " L " or " B " or the numbers 9 , 5 or 4 . Whatever . And hurry . What am I looking at ? Turns out Skylar was working for the NSA on various classified projects . Meanwhile , sending encrypted messages back and forth to a contact with the call name " Z. " Z ? Nathan , I 'm not a cryptologist . I can 't read this . Neither could the NSA . They couldn 't break the code . Agent I spoke with said they 'd never run into an algorithm this complex . Well , Skylar was never big on sharing . They think she 's been sharing information with a foreign intelligence agency . Chinese , Mossad , ISI . That 's a big leap . I got a bigger one for you . Encryptions like this , I think she could be communicating with an Alpha , even Red Flag . Well , let 's not get ahead of ourselves here . I get it . You 're a psychiatrist , you like to put your patients on the couch , talk things out . But we don 't have time for that . If you can 't handle this , step aside . I 'll take care of it myself . What are you doing here ? Needed a few things . I 'll mail you a check . So you came all this way just to raid my apartment ? Not exactly . So , officially , this is a joint operation with the NSA , but truth be told ... Little more like finders , keepers , huh ? Exactly . That 's why we have to find her first . Well , it 's transmitting a signal , but to what , I wonder . Still no Gary . We sure could use him right now . I know . I 'm a little concerned . I 've sent three messages to Sandra , and , you know , Gary doesn 't do well with illness , not to mention breaks in his ... Listen , guys . Guys , I just got off the phone with NYPD . Right after Skylar pulled her little sound and light show , car 's hotwired a block away . So I had put them a BOLO on it . Patrol unit just found it right outside of Nina 's apartment . Oh , we need ... I can 't believe I 'm doing this . I 'm kind of surprised myself . Well , if Rosen 's not gonna keep his promise , then I 'll do it for him . You better toss your phone . What ? They 're probably tracking you already . Yeah , but it 's got all my photos . Okay , you 're either in or you 're out . Okay . Fine . Congratulations . You 're free . Actually , it felt pretty good . Okay , so where am I taking you ? Off the map . We gotta make a quick stop first . I need to kill Bob . I don 't want to kill Bob . Sounds like you don 't have much of a choice . He 's the only reason they keep finding me . Well , you gotta do what you gotta do . There 's a two-foot gap between the sensors . It 's a tight squeeze . How do you know so much about this place ? I designed the security . What about him ? Are you ladies lost ? I 'm gonna take a wild guess and say Skylar was here . Well , she 's not upstairs . Jeez . Our espresso machine . It took me weeks to figure this thing out . She 's not answering her phone . Guys , I just talked to a parking attendant next door . He said Nina left a few hours ago . In her car , with some chick . So , what are we saying ? What , Skylar kidnapped her now ? Cameron , you and I both know Nina never does anything she doesn 't want to . Let 's go . Open the door . Good . And stand here and count to a million . Slowly . Hello , Bob . So this is Bob ? The one and only . And he can track down anyone on Earth ? Using their unique bio-electric signature and existing satellite technology . Seemed like a fun project at the time . But lately , he hasn 't been playing for the right team . Well , if the NSA 's been following your every move , then how come they don 't know where you are right now ? Processing lag . I spent months trying to fix it . Good thing I didn 't . But they 'll be here soon . It 's pretty cool . Bob 's brain . Most advanced processor in the world . Rest in peace . No streets with " B , " " L , " 4 , 5 or 9 . 79 bucks . Hey ! Where are you going ? Stay here . I 'll be right back . Seriously ? I 'll wait here . I can find you . All right , where are we going ? Okay , you have to go this way . You have to follow the bug . The bug ? Yeah . Go forward . Follow the bug forward . The bug better have money , my friend . No . Stop . It 's the other way . We have to go this way . - What , reverse ? - Yeah . Follow the bug . Follow the bug . Back it up , back it up . All right , all right . Back it up , back it up . I am backing it up . What the hell was that thing ? Well , according to these , it 's an incremental bio-electrical parser . Of course it is . Gary ran away ? Sandra , I thought he was home , sick . What 's going on there ? Look . No , I 'm just asking ... Well , I find it very hard to believe that he ... Sandra , I 'm going to have to call you back . I 'm right in the middle of something . Yes , well , tell me as soon as he gets there , or when he gets in contact with you at all . Thank you . Skylar did this ? According to my NSA contact , this machine can track down anyone on Earth . And if coordinated with a predator drone ... Looking at Skylar 's notes , the processor should be right in here . She took it with her . Yeah , but for what ? Her encrypted messages have increased with this contact , Z. She 's stolen this device . She 's planning something . Apparently so . Misjudged another patient , Doc . Gotta work on that . We need to make one more stop . What is it now ? You 'll see when we get there . Enough with the games . I want answers . It 's not something that I can talk about . You 're gonna tell me where we 're going , why we took Bob 's brain , what you 've been hiding . You 're going to tell me everything . Are you pushing me ? Modified contact lenses . I came prepared . I knew I could find you . Gary ? Nina , what are you doing here ? Who 's this ? How did you find us ? This ! It 's exchanging EMF signals with her phone at 81 megahertz . Nina , you have to pay the cab driver . I don 't have $ 812 dollars . Gary , you shouldn 't be here . And 90 cents . No , it 's okay . I called Dr. Rosen . He 's coming here right now . And the cab driver said he deserves a big tip . This was a mistake . Thanks for helping . And then ... And I couldn 't open my hand . And then ... Then everything was tingly , and so then I closed my eyes . And then ... Then you were here . You had a mild electrical shock , Gary , but it 's gonna be all right . Yep . Just relax . Take a few deep breaths . Okay , I need something else to drink , though . I want something purple . I got you , partner . Thanks , Bill . You have to recycle that . You 're gonna be all right . Okay . Nina , about this stop she 's making before Canada . She didn 't tell me anything . I know you want to protect her . So do I. But you 're not thinking clearly . She is desperate , she 's dangerous and she may even be involved with Red Flag for all we know . Is that what Clay 's been saying ? Nina , I know why you 're doing this . When you first came to me , you 'd been doing pretty much whatever you wanted in your life . And it got you into some difficult situations . And we helped you to control those impulses . And I know it wasn 't easy , you often felt that you were sacrificing your true identity . But running away with Skylar is not the way to reclaim your old self . That 's not the way ... I didn 't help Skylar because I wanted to be reckless . I did it because we promised her we 'd help her , because it was the right thing to do and it felt good . Maybe you should try it some time . Nina , I need your help . Gary , any luck ? No . She must have cut the link . So we lost her again . Well , you know she had some help from your girl . Gary , I got a slushy thing or ... This one . Pomegranate ... You sure ? This one . I swear the car was right here . What kind of car ? It 's a Volvo , station wagon . Did you see it ? I just went in for 15 minutes . Rachel ? It 's biodiesel . We can track that . You know it 's gotta be her . Yeah . All right , come on . Doc , we got a lead ! You made it . I was worried . We gotta move quick . Where 's Z ? Upstairs . Take this next right . The diesel , it 's that way . I hear three heartbeats . Two on the second floor bedroom facing south and another one on the ground floor . All right , folks , we should assume this Z is armed and dangerous . I wouldn 't underestimate Skylar , either . I should talk to her . Maybe you shouldn 't . I think you might want to sit this one out . Okay ? Okay . Fine . Everything okay ? Oh , that was Sullivan . Clay 's on his way . We need to move in now . You ready , Gary ? Yeah , it 's show time . You have to put this in your ear . Yeah . It 's uncomfortable . Go ! Now keep it there , okay ? Yeah . Hicks , go right . I said go right . You have to listen to me . I 'm calling the shots here . Calm down . It 's show time . Yeah , you said that already . Yeah , I know . All right , Gary , where are we ? Okay , coast is clear . Go right now . Who the hell are you ? I 'm a secret agent . That 's it ! You have some things you want to tell us . Are you looking for my mommy ? This is incredible . Never seen anything like this . I mean , this is , what ? Way past calculus at least , right ? Oh , yes . How long has Zoe been doing this ? Since she was three . At first , it was just numbers , playing with them , talking about them . Then she was solving equations and proving formulas . I 've never encountered quantitative aptitude on this level before in a child , or an adult . I knew eventually people would come after her . Like they did with you . If the NSA found out about Zoe , do you think they 'd let me keep her ? They 'd turn her into a lab rat , or worse . So I gave her to my Uncle Wesley to take care of . So it was Zoe who created the super encryption and enabled you to talk back and forth without anybody else knowing , hmm ? It 's astonishing . She 's a second - generation Alpha . You going to answer that ? No . It 's Sullivan . So what happens now ? This isn 't our choice to make , Nina . There 's always a choice . If we let them take Skylar and Zoe , then who 's next ? Bill ? Rachel ? Cameron ? Me ? It 'd be nice if we could do exactly as we pleased . But life doesn 't work like that . She 's gone , Clay . She was in the house . She was under surveillance , but she 's gone . Let me guess . She just disappeared into thin air . She was able to put together a device that distracted everyone ... If you think I 'm gonna let this slide , then you 've really misjudged me , too . No , they ... They just called . No , Alan , he 's okay . Thank God . I don 't know what I would have done ... Hi , Mom . Listen , I gotta go . I was so worried about you . Don 't you ever do that to me again . Okay . I 'm not going to work for Uncle Alan . I work for Dr. Rosen . No ! Gary , it 's not safe . I am just trying to look out for you . Mom , you listen , okay ? I look out for me . And ... And the team looks out for me . They do . And the only reason that I told you what I do is because you made me . And ... But I shouldn 't have because it 's classified and you don 't tell your mom classified stuff . Gary ... And you 've always said to me that you want me to grow up and to be more normal . No . And to have ... No , no , no , I never said that . I never would say that . I said I wanted you to be happy and safe . Yeah , to be happy . Well , Mom , I 'm a secret agent now , okay ? And I am happy . Okay . Goodnight , Mom . Goodnight . I love you . Yeah , I love you too , Mom . Great report . If you like fiction . It 's all true . It 's what you left out , Lee . Well , I 'm sure Agent Nathan Clay will be more than happy to fill in the blanks . I 'm sure he will too , considering he 's already raising hell over at the DOD . He does his job and I do mine . As far as I 'm concerned , my team takes precedent . And I make all my decisions accordingly . Well , I guess that just leaves me in the middle . You know what the hardest part of my job is ? Protecting your ass . And you don 't make it any easier . Ah , quantum physics and lollipops . What could be better , hmm ? Did they buy your story ? It all worked out , more or less . So you dropping off the map ? As far as I can go . Oh , I made something for Gary to make up for zapping him . It 's just a normal phone with a few extra bells and whistles . I 'm sure Gary will be thrilled . Press the red button six times , you get a direct line to me . Hopefully we 'll talk more than every five years . So our agreement ? It 's pretty much the coolest thing I ever built . Ah ! With a few modifications , I could find every Alpha on the planet . Serve them up to your bosses on a platter . Right . You 're right . That felt good . Cappuccino machine . Where 'd this thing come from ? There 's no return address . It 's even more complicated than the one she broke . Pretty handy with these things . Hang on . Here we go . Excuse me , ladies . Give me a little room here . Really ? There 's no buttons . Hang on . Um ... All right , hang on . - I got this . Can 't push machines , Nina . Venti non-fat , double macchiato half-caf with extra foam . Enjoy your beverage , Nina . Thank you very much . Mmm-hmm . I wonder if it could give me advice on men . Oh , there 's a joke . Bill said you like your coffee like you like your ... Your ... Men . Men . It 's an inappropriate joke , Gary ! Bill said , " Women . " Hey , do you know it 's rude to read other people 's mail ? Thank you . Bill ? Nope . I 'm not promising anything . P equals X minus 1 over 3 Minus 1 If each coefficient is an integer Where P is not divisible by X

 I don 't understand why you won 't listen to me . It 's a splice overlap PCR reaction with an immune-modulatory gene . It will help the body identify the virus and create antibodies . Yes , you are young and have a bright career ahead . Don 't waste your time with schoolboy science fiction . NIELS : The virus is spreading . There are cases being reported beyond the Middle East . It will be in Oslo by winter . It is deadly and will likely mutate . Niels , I am well aware of what 's at stake . But what you are proposing is too dangerous . The Australians tried it on mousepox . It was a complete disaster . I have already done the experiment . - What ? - On myself ... while you were gone , and it worked . - You 're mad . NIELS : I 'm still here . - Absolutely mad . - I 'm perfectly healthy . Professor Lindblom . You stay away from my lab . You hear me ? I am finished with you . Professor ... - What was that ? - Stubborn old man still living in the past . He still views you as his pupil . Someday the world will see you like I do . But only I get to be your wife . Now let 's eat . I have a plane to catch . Ahem . Ugh , Oslo to London . London to Frankfurt . And if I don 't miss my connection , I have less than a day in Rome . Ahh , too much travel . Mm . And I think I 'm coming down with something . I 've been taking these homeopathic immunoboosters . Jana swears by them . [ DOOR OPENS ] RUSKOV : You 'll be happy to know that the ship is finally repaired . Dr. Scott can 't have gone too far . We 'll find her again . Well , you found and lost her several times before . Forgive me for not getting my hopes up . If she were close to having a vaccine , where would she go ? She would need animals to test it on . Ones that are bigger than these . RUSKOV : Like what ? Monkeys . Closest place to here is Puerto Rico . RUSKOV : No . Captain Chandler would have wanted to get farther away from us . It must be somewhere else . Central America , then . Can you be more specific ? No . RACHEL : Remember I told you I discovered an extra gene on the virus ? All this time I 've been struggling to figure out where it came from . It turns out that it 's a human gene . Someone added a human gene to the virus ? - Why ? - I have no idea . No matter what I try , the virus seems to be one step ahead of me . It 's outsmarting whatever I throw at it . Worse , it 's made the original virus 10 times more lethal and virtually indestructible . How many monkeys you have left ? Three ? Two . COSSETTI : Hey . Afternoon . MILLER : You want to listen to the same 50 songs for the rest of your life ? Three playlists for one granola bar . You ain 't gonna find a better deal . Don 't even think about it , Pete . Everybody knows Miller 's got the lamest music . All right . You get the goods , when I get mine . - Done . Yup . SAMPSON : Okay ? It 's gonna take time , bro . [ SIGHS ] [ GRUNTS ] Heard you were up and about . - Doing great , sir . - Hmm . And your team ? Cruz is fully healed , been whooping the new guys into shape . And I talked to Cossetti . He 's contrite , sir . Anxious to prove himself again . Let 's get him out there as soon as we can . - It 'll help him win back some of the crew . - Makes sense . We didn 't want to hit you with this until you were back . But you 're aware we 're punishing Lieutenant Foster . - I am . - Two weeks ' double night watch for you . - Starting tonight . - Yes , sir . Complete transparency as to why you 're being punished . It 's not enough that people know you broke rules . They need to know why it 's dangerous . - Sir , I cut it off after that night . - Doesn 't change a word I 've said . - I don 't want people to lose faith in me , sir . - You 're a leader . Lead . WOMAN 1 [ OVER RADIO ] : I can 't believe how fast my girl is growing . She started to roll onto her tummy , and she can almost sit up by herself now . But I think we 're gonna have to ... MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : We 're in Little Rock . We do have a little bit of water , but we sure could use some more . WOMAN 2 [ SINGING OVER RADIO ] : This way that we take . That 's Marilyn . Palm Beach . She was a bunny at the Miami Playboy Club in the ' 60s . She puts on her own show every afternoon . She 's amazing . We have a good signal today . WOMAN 3 [ OVER RADIO ] : Please . Is anyone out there ? I 'm on a fishing boat ... - Too sad . I 'm going back ... - No . Wait . Stay . WOMAN 3 : My name is Bertrise . Everyone on the boat is dead . But I 'm not sick . I swear it . I just need help . Please . Wayne . Get Dr. Scott and the C.O. WOMAN 3 : Won 't last much longer . I 'm scared . Please . She 's an 18-year-old girl from Jamaica on a fishing boat ... off the coast of St. John Point . I logged her three weeks ago . There were 50 people on her boat . A week later we heard her again ... - but then there were only 15 people left . - And now she 's alone . So if everyone on her boat has died from the virus and she 's the only one alive ... it could be she 's naturally immune . - Want us to find her ? - I need you to find her . If I can take a look at her DNA ... we might figure out a way to beat this thing . Awfully convenient . - You think it 's a trap ? - I don 't know . How many immune people in the world ? Be incredibly rare , but of course they exist . Are you absolutely sure that it 's been this girl 's voice on the radio the entire time ? I know that voice . Gator . Any idea where she might be ? I 've got four RDF bearings from some of her recent transmissions . Sixty percent confidence of her position within 10 miles . A boat that size . Still would take hours to find her , if we found her at all . Sir , she 's all alone out there . She 's running out of water . We don 't even know how much longer she 'll last . We have to reach out to her . Sir , if I may . Breaking radio silence ... broadcasts our bearing to anyone out there listening . SAILOR : And we are broadcasting . - Bertrise ? Bertrise , you there ? Bertrise ? WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Hello ? This is Bertrise . Can you hear me ? Bertrise , this is Joe Brown . I 'm on a fishing boat . I might be in your area . Oh , my God . Are you talking to me ? Hello ? I need you to find the GPS . It 's a little computer screen with numbers on it . Okay . Okay . I know what it is . Can you read me those numbers ? It says 18 , then 36.4 , and the letter N. One-eight tack 36.4 north . Can you read me the next line of numbers ? Seventy-nine , 46.7 , W. - Are you coming ? - She 's approximately 280 miles north . Yes , Bertrise . We 're coming to get you . Oh ! Thank you . The boat has a blue octopus painted on the side . - Can you keep talking to me ? - I 've gotta go now so we can find you . - Please don 't hang up . - Hang tight . We 're on our way . [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN RUSSIAN ] RUSKOV : CRUZ : Which boat are we in ? Doc hasn 't cleared me yet , so ride Cobra Two with Lieutenant Burk and his team . - You got it . - Good . COSSETTI : You wanted to see me , sir ? You 've only been on my team for a couple weeks . But everything you do ... reflects on me . I 'm not gonna be out there today to cover your ass . I 'm aware , sir , that everybody 's doubting me . That I brought that on myself . But I will do the job . You know you took Frankie Benz 's spot . You can never fill those shoes , and I don 't expect you to . But you gotta bring it . Every second of every day from here on in . Or I will find somebody else that will . I 'll bring it , sir . You 'll ride with captain in Cobra One . Sir , I just wanted to ... tell you I appreciate this opportunity . I won 't let you down . - Gear up , then . - Yes , sir . Mason , monitor all stations . We need to hear everything that 's going on . - Aye , sir . - Remember , no transmissions . Nathan James does not transmit under any circumstance . - Where are the beacons ? SLATTERY : They 're not wearing any . Can 't risk anybody else picking up their location . CHANDLER [ OVER RADIO ] : From 1835.20 north , 70946.12 west ... contact bear 320 . MASON : Sir , they 've located the boat . Put it on speaker . BURK [ OVER RADIO ] : Roger that , captain . All right , fellas . Masks on . Stay frosty . Fan out . Search every inch of this boat . They 're boarding the Octopus , sir . [ BURK SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ] JETER : Steady . Watch our 3 . TEX : Come on . Where is she ? Bertrise ! SAILOR 1 : Nothing in the hole . CRUZ : Bertrise , we 're not gonna hurt you . MILLER : Set security . SAILOR 2 : To the left . Left . JETER : Bertrise . CHANDLER : Search every inch of this boat . MILLER : We 're here to help you . CRUZ : Got you covered . Bertrise ! Bertrise ! MILLER : No sign of her , captain . CHANDLER : Keep looking . She has to be somewhere . - Tex . Cossetti . Come with me . COSSETTI : Yes , sir . CHANDLER : U.S. Navy . We 're hereto help you . TEX : Bertrise ! Bertrise ! You down here ? This does not feel right . [ GASPS ] CHANDLER : Bertrise , are you down here ? There 's nothing but death down here . JETER [ OVER RADIO ] : Captain , we got company . - What direction ? You got something ? - Negative , sir . Tower , CIC . I want that bird in the air now . WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Good to go . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Paging final prep here . Two boats approaching . Fast off the starboard bow . JETER : All right , give me eyes , 360 . JETER : It 's the Russians . - Sons of bitches . You think they set us up ? Might not be anybody alive on board . We don 't know that . Keep looking . BURK : Sir , we have 30 , maybe 40 seconds before they 're in firing range . And we don 't know how many more are behind them . [ WOMAN WHIMPERING ] Bertrise ? - I found her . - They got her . You 're not fishermen . - No . We 're the United States Navy . COSSETTI : We 're here to help . Come on . JETER : We got her , captain . - Got her . - Get her out of here . Now ! CRUZ : Go , go , go ! Move , move , move ! JETER : I got you . Come on , let 's go . BURK : Cruz , take the helm . JETER : Package is on the RHIB . - Cobra Two , extract now ! - We 'll create a diversion . CRUZ : Aye , sir . JETER : Go with Burk in Cobra Two . - Damn it ! - Go , Cossetti ! Get moving , Cossetti . Get moving . JETER : Stay down . Good . BURK : Move it ! Move it ! Where 's my bird ? Tell me she 's in the air . PILOT [ OVER RADIO ] : Clearing the deck . Show is en route . WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Copy , read that . [ GUNFIRE ] SAILOR [ IN RUSSIAN ] : - Come on , Tex ! - Hey , man . It 's not as easy as it looks . Son of a bitch . Enough of this shit . Tex , go to the 50 cal . When I brake hard starboard , light them up . TEX : Yeah , baby . Ha-ha-ha . We took a lot of hits . We 're sinking . If those are the Russians , they 'll be back . You dive ? MAN [ IN RUSSIAN OVER RADIO ] : The girl 's boat is close to here . Assuming the Russians were coming from Cuba ... their ship should be in this region . Their boats were broadcasting from here . What am I doing here ? Your Russian pals are back . - You sure ? What 'd they say ? - I don 't know . That 's why you 're here . You 're gonna sit down next to Mason . Eavesdropping . So you just listen . Pick up anything on the UHF , you translate . I 'm damn sure Ruskov 's out there listening to us . You 'll tell me later what this is gonna cost me . I 'll do what you ask . But when this is over , you make sure Ruskov dies . PILOT [ OVER RADIO ] : We are 20 miles from last known point of contact . CREWMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : We have contact with a vessel at 11 o 'clock , half mile . BURK [ OVER RADIO ] : Saberhawk One , Cobra Two . How copy , over ? PILOT : Solid copy , Cobra Two . BURK : We have the package . En route home base . PILOT : Account for personnel . BURK : Besides the package , seven souls . Burk , Cruz , Cossetti , Jeter , Dennison , Rowler , Walker . PILOT : Interrogative whiskey for Cobra One ? BURK : We do not know their whiskey . Repeat , we do not know their whiskey . Be advised , two Russian Zodiacs in proximity to the Octopus . PILOT : Solid copy . Saberhawk One , ETA overhead the Octopus three mikes . Nathan James , we have negative beacon contact from this vessel . How far do you think we are from that fishing boat ? - With the currents ? - Yeah . Ten miles . Maybe 15 . I don 't know whether they ... picked up on our radio transmissions or intercepted my call to Bertrise . Either way , I 'm pretty sure the Russians are closer to us than the Nathan James is . Good thing we 've got beacons in those suits , right ? I took them off before we started in case the Russians were around . - Huh . Good plan . - Yeah . You still got the radio ? Call for help . That 's a chance we 've gotta take . What ? Do it . Do it . Nathan James , this is Cobra One . MASON : Sir , that 's the captain . CHANDLER : Cease and desist all rescue operations . I say again ... - cease and desist any ... - What the hell you doing ? That 's a direct order . We 'll ride off into the sunset with that package . It has been my sincere honor serving with you all . This will be my final transmission . Please tell me that was some kind of a code . It wasn 't code . Oh , man . I mean , you gotta be kidding me . What was that ? - You 've got a death wish . - Nathan James sends a helo ... Russians can home in on it and track it back to the ship . I can 't allow that . Great . You 're martyring yourself and taking me along for the ride . Thank you very much . - I am sorry , Tex . - Sorry ? It was the proper command decision . Wasn 't worth the risk . - They need you . - No , they don 't . - They need you ! - It 's not worth the risk . So , what is your plan ? Drown out here ? Or maybe we swim back to the Octopus , hang outwith those people ... - till our eyeballs start bleeding out . - There 's a reef ... north , northeast of here . Start swimming . This is Dr. Scott . She 's gonna take care of you now . It 's an absolute pleasure to meet you . Where 's Captain Chandler ? - You heard the captain 's orders , sir . - What if it was a misdirect for the Russians ? I don 't think so . " Ride off into the sunset " is what he said . We found the girl . Now he wants us to move forward . - We can 't know that for sure . - But you know him . He 's right . - He wouldn 't leave any of us behind . - Under normal circumstances , yes . Things are different now . - Where 's Lieutenant Burk ? - Decon . - The master chief ? - Same . [ HITS WALL ] We have no contact and we have no idea where they went . They should still have radio . Captain suspended rescue ops . He won 't give us the coordinates . - Why ? - If the Russians lock in on the helo ... they can home in on us once it comes home . The helo 's launched . The XO 's gonna take one shot before it has to refuel . Now I need you to think . What directions were the Russians coming from ? Is there anything , anything you can tell me that will help us narrow this down ? Think ! I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . [ CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ] [ IN ENGLISH ] There are people starving to death in this world , and you refuse to eat . Perhaps you 'd rather be back in the brig than dine with me ? Eat , darling . Please . I suggest you explain to your daughter how lucky she is . What more do you want from us ? How about a little gratitude ? Have I not provided for you ? Taken care of your needs ? And I think I 've taken care of yours in return . You have . But not with gratitude . [ DOOR OPENS ] [ IN RUSSIAN ] [ IN RUSSIAN ] ASMIK : RUSKOV : WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Saberhawk One , state fuel . PILOT : Currently at 40 percent . Nathan James , be advised . We are also conducting IR sensor scan per sector . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Roger , Saberhawk One , copy . SLATTERY : Lieutenant Burk , over here . Where the hell are they ? RUSKOV : Mm-hm . [ ASMIK SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] Picking up mobile bandwidth low latency transmissions . Could be UAV datalink . Enable spy radar . If the Russians pick it up , they 'll track us . - You 've got 30 seconds . - Sir ? SLATTERY : I gave an order . Aye , sir . [ ENGINE BUZZING ] - You hear that ? - Sounds like a lawn mower . - It 's a UAV . - Ours ? - Theirs . - Oh , boy . Suspect track 85023 , bearing 351 , range 38 miles . Heading south-southwest at 50 knots . Recommend kill track 85023 . - Roll FIS green . - FIS is green . KARA : Killing track 85023 with bird . Salvo size one . Bird away . Track 85023 . [ RADAR BEEPING ] - Tell me that 's not a bomb . - Hope it 's a camera . It 's getting awful close . Ha , ha ! Yeah ! Thank you , Nathan James ! [ SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN ] - Mark delta . Right on target . - Datalink broadcast terminated . Secure spy radar . They shouldn 't have done that . [ ALL SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN ] Hmm . PILOT : Negative contact . Eagle Tower , this is Saberhawk One . Dusk visibility dropping with the sun . Eagle Tower , this is Saberhawk One . No sign of Cobra Team One ... in sector seven . Heading to sector eight . RACHEL : This is the last sample I 'll need ... while we wait for the results from your first test . I promise . You 're being very brave . I do apologize . I 'm the one who is sorry . I made things so difficult for the soldiers who came to rescue me . After the virus came ... there were many stories of men in suits like that with guns . We heard that they came to kill the sick people , not to rescue them . [ ALARM BEEPING ] Time to rest . Uh ... Uh , how far do you figure to that reef ? Gator said it was roughly 20 miles from the Octopus . Though he was only 60 percent sure of that . Oh , good . [ GRUNTS ] Hey , you think we 're getting anywhere ? Or do you ... think the waves are just knocking us back to where we started ? Unclear . Are you really this damn heroic ordering off your own rescue ? You 're asking me if I 'm scared to die ? I wasn 't thinking about it then , and it 's not gonna do me good to think about it now . Hey , you want to know something ? Only reason I came out here today ... is to impress that Dr. Rachel . [ LAUGHS ] - You gotta be shitting me . - Yeah . I 'm sweet on her . Yeah . You weren 't making a move . CHANDLER : Ha-ha-ha . - Yeah . - Oh , my Lord . - You think she 's interested ? - Get some rest , Tex . - Yeah . - Oh , Jesus . - Hey , opposites attract , you know . RACHEL : I was in Negril once . My parents took me to the black cliffs to watch the jumpers . Never seen anything quite like it . Me father ran a hotel there . I helped him . It was a small place , right on the beach . The sickness came first to the larger resorts in the north . Within a couple of weeks it was with us . We turned our hotel into an hospital . But after my mother died , my father took me and Dominic away . Dominic 's your brother ? He died on the boat . I 'm so sorry . When we left Jamaica , there were 51 . Within a couple of weeks , there were 15 . And then there was just me . Why didn 't I die ? Because you 're immune ... Bertrise . To every single strain of the virus . So , what does that mean ? It means we have a chance . PILOT : Visibility nil . Sunset approaching , will switch to night vision . Saberhawk One diverting ... He may have called off the rescue , but he would never give up . - No chance , sir . - Hmm . - What would you do if you were out there ? - I 'd take my chances . Swim back to the Octopus . Could be Russians . Well , all I know is captain always has a plan . Gator , how far is that reef ? Approximately 20 miles from the Octopus , sir . But they could be even farther . Yeah , but it could be closer . WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Saberhawk One , state time left . PILOT : This is Saberhawk One calling bingo now . Overhead in 20 mikes . They 're out of fuel . Then we hit that reef on the next pass , sir . Keep looking up there like it 's gonna change . It 's called navigating . It 's called drowning . It 's dark . We 're screwed . You said we 'd almost be there three hours ago . When did you become such a pessimist ? Cat 's only got nine lives . Already been through 12 or 13 of them . How 'd you join the Navy , anyway ? I joined the Navy because of my father . - He was Navy too ? - Army . I did it to piss him off . [ LAUGHS ] Well , you see how that worked out for you . Hey , don 't fall asleep . I 'm just so relaxed . You never did tell me what part of Texas you were from . Probably because I 'm from Reno . Huh . - Hey , Tex ? - Yeah , boss . I am afraid . To die ? To never see my wife . And my kids . I know what you 're doing . Playing it over and over again in your head . Every second . Every moment . What you could have done differently . I tripped . If I hadn 't , I 'd still be on the RHIB with them . Then you 'd be lost out there . What good would that do us ? Maybe they wouldn 't be lost . Maybe I could have done something . A thousand hours of training . For five minutes of pure chaos . And then a thousand hours of second-guessing yourself . That 's the job . For all of us . PILOT [ OVER RADIO ] : Saberhawk One , final approach . Gear down and locked , team landing . - Skate down . WOMAN [ ON RADIO ] : Roger , Saberhawk One . I just came from the lab . The girl has a gene mutation that makes her immune . Dr. Scott injected her blood into the monkey , and if it works ... we may have the vaccine . Well ... everybody did their job . The doctor is wondering if she can join us in here . She 's concerned about the captain . And Tex , obviously . XO , the Russians are talking . [ MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO IN RUSSIAN ] They 're still searching the water . - He thinks the Americans have drowned . - He thinks ? - What exactly did he say ? - Shh , shh . - Do they have a body ? - I don 't know . I missed some of the words . - Well , what words did you get ? - They said " drowned . " I swear , if you 're lying to me , I will strap you to a torpedo . - It 's what I heard . KARA : Sir ... helo just landed . Standing by to refuel . We can 't trust anything we hear . The Russians know we 're listening . They could be deliberately feeding us bad intel . Sir , if you mean to do this ... then I recommend we have a helo fly low zig-zag to make it harder to track it . - That 'll burn a lot of fuel , sir . MASON : Yes , it will ... but it means we 've got enough time to make one more pass . I concur . Head for that reef . PILOT : All stations report . I 'm on instruments . On altitude , 100 feet . On air speed , 90 knots . Negative contact . CREWMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : Roger . Visibility nil . They 're out there . They 've gotta be out there . PILOT : This is Saberhawk One . We see something reflecting on the surface ... to the southwest . Taking closer look . Over . Dropping down to 90 feet . CREWMAN : Roger , right side light chop . [ HELICOPTER BUZZING ] You hear that ? Hey ! Hey ! We 're here ! We 're here ! Don 't tell me you 're pissed at Slattery now . Son of a bitch . PILOT : In sight . Engaging automatic approach . - Stand by to lower the harness . CREWMAN : Roger . [ YELLING ] [ WHOOPS ] - You first ! - Not a chance . You first , captain . I insist . What is that ? What the hell ? - It 's not them . PILOT : Roger , no sign of survivors . [ IN RUSSIAN ]

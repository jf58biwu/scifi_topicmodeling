 Previously on Fringe ... Surgeries that Newton performed . He was removing transplanted brain tissue . You nearly died when you were a boy . Walternate found a cure for Peter . Walter , Peter is dead . I 'm talking about the other Peter ... the one on the other side . I 'm not from here , am I ? - Son ... - I am not your son . Peter checked himself out of the hospital three hours ago . He 's gone . Drink that , avoid the radar , you 'll be in Oakland in no time . And that is for you , Raymond . And your burger should be up in a minute . So ... where was I ? Well , you were in the middle of telling me how you moved around a lot as a kid , but I got to tell you , now I 'm hopelessly intrigued with these CDs . I 'm sort of known here by the regulars for my playlists . I base my tracks on people 's aura . Well , how often do you think I 'd have to come here to be considered a regular ? I might be able to get you on the list . First , you have to tell me where you 're from . Technically ... I 'm from no place you 've ever heard of . But let 's just say Boston . So how long are you here for ? Well , I was just planning on the one night ... passing through . To ? I don 't know yet . Okay ... Peter from Boston . I 'll burn you one . Really ? What did I do right ? It 's a long road to " I don 't know yet . " I want to make sure you stay awake out there . And I , uh ... I like your eyes . So there 's that . Where are you staying ? I 'm staying at the Drake 's bay motel . I 'll drop it by after my shift . Okay , I 'll see you then . I 'll see you then . What are you doing to me ? It may not be the best season for Skagit Valley 's famous waves of color , but with record warmth , it is still going to be one for the record books . In Mount Vernon , John Hofferste , Q13 , Fox News . Your room 's got a bed , you know . What time is it ? 6 : 00 a.m. Did a pretty girl happen to drop by here ? Hello ? Krista ? Hello ? Destination . Please say a city name . Portland . Portland . Please proceed to the highlighted route . That was obviously way too easy . Destination . Please say a city name . Mars . Sorry . Please say the city name . How you doing ? I 'm Sheriff Mathis . This is Deputy Ferguson . Hi , there . Peter Bishop . Were you a customer here last night ? I was . Do you remember your waitress ? Krista , sure . Why , did something happen to her ? Do you have any identification on you ? Of course . Krista told a coworker she was planning to meet you after her shift last night . You gonna tell me what 's going on here ? You first . Yeah , we made plans . But she never showed up . She was gonna meet me at my motel , the Drake 's bay , but I just fell asleep in the lobby . You can call the front desk , ask the guy there . Why don 't you just hang here a sec , okay ? Where are you goin ' ? Who are you lookin ' for ? Um ... No one . Oh , come on , you got to be kidding me . Krista Manning went missing last night . And you talked to her . You two spent some time . I 'd just like to hear about it . I 'd like to do that at the station , okay ? B-i-s-h-o-p . Uh , six feet , brown hair . Officer , I wasn 't staying under the name Bishop . I was registered under the name Stewart . Yeah , he says he was staying under the name Stewart . Right , okay . Thanks , Tom . Tom over at Drake 's bay confirms that he was passed out in the lobby all night . Why did you check into the motel under an assumed name , sir ? Sheriff ? This is Mathis . Go ahead . Dogs have found a body ... the spillway off route 219 and mile marker 8 . White female ... coroner 's on his way . Oh , my God . Noyo search and rescue , what 's your 20 ? E.T.A. about 45 . Confirm this is recovery , not rescue . That 's right , Wes . It 's a bad one . The coroner says the victim had some sort of operation done to her . A piece of her skull cut out . Over . Sheriff ... can you let me out of the back of this car ? Just ... please , I 'm sorry , but you 're gonna have to be patient , Mr. Bishop . Hold on for one second . Hold on . I was listening to your radio . They said that she had a piece of her skull cut out . Is she missing a part of her brain ? I know that that 's a weird question , but you need to ask the coroner whether she 's missing a piece of her temporal lobe . Please . How the hell did you know that ? You 're FBI , huh ? What exactly is a civilian consultant ? Sometimes people with certain areas of expertise can offer them to the Bureau on a consulting basis . My area of expertise is ... Weird . You mean difficult to explain ? No , I mean the strange , the inexplicable . So , uh ... can you talk me through this again ? You knew that they took her ... - Temporal lobe . - Temporal lobe ... Because it 's like a case you worked on before ? Exactly . We were never able to catch those responsible . So that 's why you 're out here . You 're tracking them down ? No . But I think that they may be tracking me down . What 'd they want with you ? I 'm not sure yet . But I thought I saw one of them earlier outside the crime scene . His name is Newton . And I think they called me at the Drake 's bay motel . There was no voice on the other end of the line . It was just static , and then a series of strange noises and clicks ... I think they killed Krista to find me . By taking her brain ? I told her where I was staying . She 's the only person who knew . Why wouldn 't they just ... Ask her where you were staying ? Or force her . I mean , why cut out her brain ? It 's possible that they needed details about me she didn 't know she had . I 'm sorry . I 'm not following . I know that this is complicated . And I 'm sorry that I can 't give you all the answers , but the case is classified . It is possible , however , that I could show you what I mean . Just give me a minute . I 'm gonna go make a few calls , Peter . Of course . Bishop , where are you ? I 'll save you the trace . I 'm in Washington State . Look , I need a favor . You 're about to get a call from the Noyo county sheriff 's department . They 're checking up on my credentials . Are you in trouble ? Mm-mm . In fact , just the opposite . I stumbled into an investigation , and I offered them my services . We 'll ask them to extend you every courtesy . Thank you . Listen ... I don 't want you to tell Walter where I am . In fact , I don 't even want you to tell him that we spoke . If you owe me anything , you owe me that . Okay . But , Bishop ... if you change your mind , I 'll send someone to pick you up . Thanks . I got to go . Take care of yourself . Krista seemed like a sweet girl . Did you know her ? She and my sister went to school together . So explain this to me . The temporal lobe is responsible for memory . So think of the brain as the greatest recording device ever created . Every sight , sound , smell , all recorded in perfect detail . But imagine that there was a way to get that data out of the brain . So what I said , what I was wearing , what time it was , where I was staying ... I know how it sounds . But believe me , if you can imagine it , it 's possible . If that 's true , if they were trying to find you , - why didn 't they just come for you last night ? - I ... I don 't know . These are not your ordinary bad guys . The tissue is very pink . Yes , and it 's not normally like that . It only happens when our bodies metabolize adrenaline . So her adrenalin 's must have spiked right before she died . Oh ... My God . " Find the crack " ? That is the worst police slogan I 've ever heard . It 's not a slogan . In the darkness , there 's always a crack . It 's how the light gets in . Ferguson gave it to me ... on our first case together . Nobody else thought I could hack it , but ... It 's ... it 's an inside joke . It looks expensive . Yeah . That 's what he keeps telling me . If that 's an accurate account of your statement , please sign it . It is , very . I 'm gonna get a room at the Northwest Passage . I 'll be staying under the name of ... Gene Cowan . So if you need me , that 's where I 'm at . You sure you don 't want a police escort ? No , I 'll be fine . You know , you say that there are people out there cutting people 's brains out to find you , and you 're smiling . Look , they may have found me . But now that I know they 're here for sure , I found them too . And now we 're gonna catch ' em . What ? I don 't know about this guy , Ann . He knew his way around there . He 's like a medical examiner . He knew the brain , biology , medications . Doesn 't mean he 's legit . You read your books about UFOs and Roswell and whacked-out theories and government conspiracies . I think that you want to believe . What makes you trust him ? I don 't know . I 'm a good judge of character . I 'm the only one here who likes you . Closed . What do you want ? If you open up , I 'll make it worth your while . Mathis ? What do you want from me ? Peter ... it 's Mathis . Who did you tell ? What are you talking about ? Just now , I got one of those phone calls . They know where I 'm staying . - And I only told you . - I didn 't ... Then ask your partner ! That 's what I 'm calling about , Peter . Ferguson 's ... Ferguson 's disappeared . When was the last time that you spoke with him ? About two hours . He went back to the scene where Krista 's body was found . He felt we might have missed something . That means that he disappeared about a half hour before I got the last phone call . You think they used him to find you , like they used Krista . What is it that makes you special ? Why haven 't they taken you ? I don 't know . I don 't even know what it all means , but I do know that these people have the answers . And that 's exactly why I need to find them . All right , then , call your friends at the FBI . - Let 's get these guys ! - No . The FBI has the expertise . - They have the resources . - And if we call the FBI , they 're gonna descend on this place , and these people will disappear . I am this close . And I am going to get my answers . You said you got calls at Drake 's bay and Northwest Passage , right ? Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , we pulled those phone records . Those calls never happened . These people can pull memories out of brain tissue . You think they can 't make a couple of calls disappear ? I can do that . People have been doing that since the ' 70s . I understand . You don 't want me to be right , 'cause if I 'm right , then that means your partner is most likely dead . Hey ... Peter ... with the exception of who you are , I haven 't been able to verify anything you 've said to me . It 's all either classified , or it 's incredible . I 'm calling the Bureau . Your partner did disappear . And I did talk to Krista . And I did get those phone calls . What if he 's alive ? What if he 's out there somewhere , thinking I am doing everything in my power , including calling the FBI to save him ? Then that is all the more reason for us to find him ourselves . If you make that phone call , we never will . Excuse me , please . Thank you . Toaster pastry . Um ... " Corn starch , soy lecithin , potassium ... bromate . " Potassium bromate ? This supermarket is trying to kill us ! You ... potassium bromate ... do you know what that is ? Are you okay , sir ? It is known to induce renal cell tumors ... Mesotheliomas of the peritoneum ! Can I call someone for you ? Call someone ? You know what ? You know what you 're putting into our bodies ? Death ! Delicious , strawberry-flavored death ! Okay , okay . I 'm calling security . Yes ! They had no right to make me wait at the police station . It 's the makers of those toaster pastries that should be in jail . Let it go , Walter . You 're home now , and you 're safe . I wasn 't expecting guests . Walter ... Why didn 't you tell me you needed help ? What am I going to do ... call you every time I run out of pudding pops ? Yes , if you need them . I need to learn to care for myself . If Peter doesn 't come back ... Walter ... They 'll send me back to the hospital , won 't they ? I won 't let that happen . Thank you . I do ... I do need pudding pops . We don 't know if he made it , but this is the last place he said he was going . Isn 't it protocol for him to call in once he gets here ? Well ... sometimes he doesn 't do that . Dummy . Bishop ? Bishop ! Peter . Mathis . What did you see ? I saw Newton and one other guy . You didn 't see them too ? They came running right past you . What 's wrong ? What the hell are you doing , Bishop ? Put down that gun . Who are you ? Bishop ... lower ... your ... weapon . In the morgue , you dropped something . Who gave it to you ? What is wrong with you ? Answer the question ! My pen ? It was a gift from Ferguson , my partner . Why is there blood on your jacket ? There is blood on my jacket because there is blood on my wrist , which I got when I fell , running . Show me . I 'm sorry . I needed to know that your blood was still red . What other color would it be ? So these , uh , shape-shifters , they ... make themselves look like other people ? Yeah , it 's a technology unlike anything you 've seen before . Peter ... I want to level with you . I , um ... believe in the unknown . Yeah . " Find the crack . " I get it . No , I mean ... I read books about ... UFOs and conspiracy theories . But I do think ... I mean , I am wondering right now ... if you are not completely off your rocker . - They were there . - I didn 't see them ... or the dart they shot . I know you didn 't , because they removed it . I know how this must look ... from your point of view ... I mean , I was there once too . But ... You just did it . Did what ? You just questioned your own sanity . I 'm not questioning ... When was the last time you slept ? I 'm not hallucinating . And I 'm not paranoid . And I 'm not questioning my own sanity . I was wondering why you would listen to me . You 're desperate . Ferguson is more than just your partner , isn 't he ? So there is something between the two of you . You said back at the precinct that ... that I was trying to rationalize that he was still alive . You may be right . I may be doing it right now . He may be dead . But I won 't believe it until I see his body . I can 't . Mathis . You want me to go look ? Sheriff . The victim 's a white female . She has part of her skull missing . I don 't recognize this girl . You never seen her before ? No , I 've never seen her before . Who is she ? I talked to Gwynn right before her shift ended . We 'd talked about her coming over last night to help me color my hair . I figured she just got tired . I should have called her . You couldn 't have known . I 'm sorry . Did your sister ever hang out at the Hilltop Cafe ? Um ... I don 't think so . What about the Mosser brothers gas station out on route 202 ? I filled up there on the way into town . Her pickup 's a diesel , and I don 't think Mosser 's carries diesel . Fine , what about the Drake 's bay motel ? Would she ever go there for any reason ? Peter ... what 's this about ? It 's just ... part of our investigation . If you could just write down your address for us . She is grieving , and you are not getting anywhere . The Hadron Super Collider is less complicated than that infernal dishwater . Next time , don 't use laundry detergent , and the dishwasher will work fine . Thank you , Astrid . You 're a federal agent . I doubt , during your years of training , that you had dreams of babysitting a helpless old man . You are not that helpless . A little disorganized , maybe . Don 't you usually keep this in the bathtub ? Walter ? I took this little car from the Zelazney building . Objects from the other universe like this emit a glimmer , a distinctive energy signature . It may be possible to detect that signature . So ? So I need you to gather all the objects from the other side that we recovered from the Zelazney building - and from Jacksonville and bring them to the lab . - Okay , why ? To build a device to read that energy signature ! Peter emits the same energy , don 't you see ? This is how we will find Peter . I must have seen Gwynn somewhere , or she had to have seen me . I mean ... she has to have had some value to them , some knowledge that they needed . We 'll go to your motel and get your things , get you something to eat , and ... You can stay at my house tonight . It 's okay . I 'll be fine . You 're my only connection to finding Bill right now . I want you safe . What color was Gwynn 's truck ? Tan brown . Driver 's side window is rolled down . Glove compartment 's open . Okay , so this girl pulls over her truck , rolls down the window , and then opens up the glove box . You tell me ... why would she do that ? She got pulled over by a cop . Or someone pretending to be a cop ... or Bill . Pretending to be Bill ? Well , these shape-shifters , they take on the appearance of people in positions of authority . Where you going ? I 'm calling the FBI . Why ? First , you said they cut out his brain to find you . Now you 're telling me he may have been shape-shifted ? Which is it , Peter ? Did I make a mistake not calling the FBI ? I am very scared right now . Wait , wai ... wait . Just hold on for one second . Those people , when they were taken , they must have been afraid , right ? And when they were killed , they must have been terrified . So ? So I know how to find them . Do you know how airplanes have blackboxes ? To record flight data , sure . Yeah , well , human bodies collect data as well . Both Krista and Gwynn 's muscle tissue was flooded with adrenaline . Yeah , I remember . Well , the tissue would 've partially metabolized the adrenaline . So we should be able to measure the rate of absorption , which will tell us when the adrenaline was first produced . What about Newton ? - How does that help us find him ? - Look ... Normally , your adrenaline levels are flat . Then you experience fear . A spike in adrenaline . Sometime later , you experience more fear , say , in the moments right before you were killed ... another spike , two points of fear . Now , we already know where the girls were abducted . So if we can just determine how much time took place between these two intervals ... Then we can figure out where they were killed . Exactly right . There is one more thing . We 're gonna need a control sample . Can you stick that in the centrifuge ? It 's that thing right over there . Ah . - Hey ! - I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry . I just needed to scare you . I 'm gonna need to take a tissue sample from you . How is Dr. Bishop doing ? Walter 's trying to adjust to a very difficult situation . He 's concerned about being sent back to St. Claire 's . Will he be able to function if Peter doesn 't come back ? I 'm sure that Peter will come back . Do you know something ? Have you spoken to him ? Krista Manning 's adrenaline spikes were 42 minutes apart . So assuming that Newton drove the speed limit , 60 miles an hour ... On these roads , that 'd be a good way to get killed . He would have stuck to 45 . All right , 45 . Okay , the center point is where Krista was taken . At 45 miles per hour , the farthest they could have gone would be 31 and a half miles . Gwynn , our second victim ... was taken much farther out of town , almost on the other side of the county . Her adrenaline spikes are 57 minutes apart . Again , factoring 45 miles per hour ... That 's it . That 's our kill zone . You 're assuming he killed them both in the same place . They were using complex medical equipment . It 's not easy to move an operating room . Much simpler to just bring the victims to a specified location ... someplace out of the way . Like an old dairy farm ? Just ask him something only he would know . Hello , there . It 's , uh , Craig , right ? - Yeah . - I don 't know if you remember , but , uh , I think you were in choir with my sister up at St. Andrew 's . Well , actually , I was at Good Shepherd . Good memory , though . Yeah , Good Shepherd ... that 's right . So , uh , what can I do for you ? Your old dairy farm up the hill . Could there be people up there ? - People ? - Yeah , you get up there often ? No , not much , since we shut it down . Why ? Okay , we got 12 outbuildings ... the milking parlors , the barn , and the holding stalls . Those are all good places to hide . That 's a lot of ground to cover . I 'll go call backup to help with the search . Need any help with the search ? I think it 's best if you stay here . Let me get you the keys . Sure . Uhh ! Ohh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! Unh ! Uhh ! Uh ! Who are you ? Where 's Newton ? Peter , stop ! I couldn 't stop . The girls ... I wanted to be close to them . I just couldn 't stop . Where is he ? Where 's Ferguson ? What did you do to him ? Bill ? Bill ? Peter ... Bill ! Bill ... He 's still breathing . Thank God . Bill . It 's just ink . There 's no incision here . I 'm gonna go call an ambulance . Bill . Stay with me , baby . I 'm here . I 'm here now . I 'm here , Bill . I don 't know what to say . You saved Bill 's life , and you tracked a killer ... what else is there to say ? I wish there was something I could do for you . Whatever your experiences are , whatever you can 't or won 't tell me about ... I think you 're looking for meaning in things that ... have no meaning . I don 't know who I am anymore . When I was in college ... my family was killed , murdered . I 'm sorry . Sometimes I still think ... one day I might catch whoever did it . I was alone for a long time . But I found my place . You will too . Once we isolate the glimmer , we can find Peter . Is the spectrograph ready , Agent Farnsworth ? Walter , you put in the wrong numbers . No , no , I believe they 're correct . No , they 're not . But , then , you know that already , don 't you ? I thought you wanted to find Peter . What if he won 't forgive me , Astrid ? All I have now is hope ... hope that he will come to understand why I did the things I did . What if I find him , and he won 't forgive me ? What do I have then ? - Hey . - Hey , Olivia . Walter ... I found Peter . W ... where ? He 's in Washington state . I 'm heading to the airport now . Would you like to come with me , Walter ? I 'll need to pack a bag . Peter , Peter . Mr. Secretary . Hello , son .

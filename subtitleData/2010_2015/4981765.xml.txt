 July 20 , 1969 , Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong , first man on the Moon . In 1970 , the mission of Apollo 18 , 19 20 was canceled because of budget problems . December 7 , 1972 , Apollo 17 , an official mission to the moon last , landed on the moon . the film was edited from the video . Much is at stake . We 're talking about the nation against nation . The race continues . There is still much to be discovered out there . There 's a phone on a Friday . When the barbecue at Ben 's . Drink some beer or more . If Ben is cooking , you will need it . Nate picked up the phone from Milton . And Milton is saying ... 18 operational . But it 's very confidential . Milton asked if no problems with it ? Nate says : Are you serious ? I come from a family of military pilots . The task is sometimes more important than private life . My choice . Continues to advance . NASA has become " a pile of stones . Why do we need more , I do not know , but this trip to the moon . Installing the camera . We set it up in various places . I think what you 've described is . They use the Saturn 5 to launch the Defense Department 's secret cargo . A very large and heavy . And apparently unmanned . It turns out . We install high-frequency transmission ... early warning systems as part of the Russian anti-missile system . PSD 5 is a sophisticated radar scanners . This tool should keep track of anything that we can not . so that Russia remains tracked . It would be nice if I could tell my wife . He always supported me . He thought I was training with the Japanese space agency . My son Brian , I would say that the father went to the moon ? I want to bring a souvenir for him . Stone month , maybe . Maybe someday . Ben was always the first in its class . I 'm always right behind him . I 'm jealous because he will walk on the moon with Nate ... while I was alone in orbit . My job is to bring us home safely . We realize this mission-oriented results . So we must not fail . And something could be wrong . You have to rack my brain . This is not an option . I 'm proud to do for these people , and for my country . Ten , nine , eight ... seven , six , five ... four , three , two , one . Apollo 18 , looks good . Christmas lights . you take back your Christmas lights ? - I do not . Did you ever see anything like that ? - No It was amazing . Earth and all its glory . A child who is handsome . Are you sure it was your son ? - Be careful with what you said . He 's a good kid . He 's big shoes to be filled . Boots months . Nate , you have been waiting along time to set foot on the moon . Now You 're number 13 . How do you feel about that ? - Do you not anything left in the back , John ? It 's nice to have time alone . quite crowded here . I 'll watch for you . Do not sleep are too late . See you in a few days . - Understood . See you in a few days . Houston , here Freedom . We will release Liberty . 18 okay , you are welcome to take it off into orbit . John , the tunnel had been given the air ? The tunnel had been given the air . Are you ready ? We will send an update . Data arrives . Computer , everything is yours . I hope you shared with us , John . Be careful in there . - Sure . We have good visibility . - All right 18 , you can land . We went to the moon . 426 meters . 125 meters down . Toward the 300 meters . You 're on track . LPD 54 . - Twenty feet down . Look good . Duration of mission : Four days , 6 hours and 33 minutes . Aligning . Degrade . I see a good place . - Where ? After that the next crater . Direction at 12 . There are some rocks . 131 meters . 5 meters down . Houston , there is an alarm . 1201 . 1201 . - Understood . 1201 . 18 , what is seen ? Are you going to try another approach ? - No , no time . Three , two , one . - How visible ? We go too fast . - Stabilize . We headed to the manual . Small contacts . - Standby . Shut up , Liberty . Houston , give them a cigar . from here it looks pretty . - Good landing . You talking to me or to Nate ? To you both . December 25 , 1974 . Mission duration : 4 days 9 hours , 23 minutes . Commander , Nathan Walker . The mission of the Department of Defense Report 1A . We were on the first day of a two-day mission , preparing briefing . Here Thomas Young of Apollo Mission Control . Preparing a 16 mm camera ... Looks like there are 5 , 10,000 original Kodachrome . Houston , we are ready for the first EVA . ( EVA = extravehicular Activity : activity room empty ) Understandably , in the permitted cabin decompression . Dress it deserves . Do not get cold . I 'll check it out. hopefully the hose is long enough . Check . Houston ... we take the first steps on the south pole . It looks nice . We will do our best . I can not describe how it feels to be here . rocks everywhere . The sun low on the horizon . Amazing . Freedom , do you hear ? Freedom to hear loud and clear . Yes , it 's perfect . You call that respect ? I took his picture you with LEM in the background . ( LEM = Lunar Excursion Module ) That seems like a naval salute . Wait a minute . I must take this . I promised Lauren and Brian to spend Christmas with them . This is all going back to the Department of Defense . We put a camera in the south Westinghouse . Sounds great , Nate . Standby . The camera can follow you very well , Nathan . Captain Veal said the first round for you , when you return . I checked the charge on the main unit . What is it ? Houston , check out the panel . I want to see the error . You can check the location and start the process . We will move . Look at it . Makes you think , right ? . It 's dusty . I let the camera here , so you can see better . Hard to believe that the sun never shines on some place like this . Be careful , my friend . If you fall into the crater , then you can not get out . PSD5 has been positioned . - Understood . Did you record the frequency of the signal PSD5 during training ? Not been on the set ? . - I think so . I think they have to change . Coordinates : 4.3 on Z and ... Initiation process is complete . Is there another disorder ? Collecting geological samples . It appears from the impact crater . Samples were ... weird . Great , we 'll save it here . Duration of mission : four days , 14 hours and 48 minutes . Commander Nathan Walker . Report of the Department of Defense mission 3C . Day of unity , EVA has been completed . I 'm starving . What our menu today ? Peas or carrots ? - Give me a carrot . I choose peas . - Perfect . I 'm proud of you . Do you enjoy your time there ? - Yes . There are a lot of noise at this frequency . I 'll try to isolate it . Clarify a little . To understand . Astronaut Brian Anderson , with his father flew into space . What are you doing ? - I 'm playing . Do not play with your father 's goods . Is this a record ? - Forgive me , Father . I love you . Beverley into a panic because a meeting with the hair stylist canceled . Stan and Gene is not ready , nothing is ready , so ... I offered to cut the chili . A few moments later I pee in the shower , with all the chili in my hand ... before I knew it , my legs were burning . I 'm in the bathroom crying in pain . - They can not hear you . They could hear me . Stan 's wife is a nurse , so ... he sent me back to the bathroom , with a cup of milk . Wait a minute , You did not enter a " ball " into your glass of milk , right ? Make no mistake , it worked . - Basic chili penis . I do not believe you 've never heard that story ? Beverly returned to Miami ? - Yes. that 's what I heard . You realize it , she was divorced from you because you snore . - I do not snore . Every time . you okay ? - Yes . Bump your head ? - Again . Basic big head . - The first day is great . Good evening , JD . - I should not tell you about it , asshole . Nate ? - Yeah , I hear it . What is it ? - Wait . There should be on the monitor . What is it ? Hear that ? - Yes . I do not think it comes from here . His voice does not look good . I can not find here . - Strange . Interference can come from PSD5 ? We see no evidence . We will discuss with the Department of Defense . We will look into it . Go to sleep . I woke up . Turn off the sound . Good morning , Liberty . We have solved the problem , a few hours ago . You should be fine . Are you ready for the day of the second EVA . Duration of mission : five days , eight hours and 34 minutes . I need this record . Nate says he never snored in his sleep . I have proof . Friends tell me something , Freedom will be in the back corner . There is no communication for a while . - Understood . Me to make you breakfast . - What do I get ? Scrambled eggs . - Again . What do you have ? - Ham tasty spreads . That maybe you have . Just like Mom made . Did you move the sample belongs to me ? Sampelku one floor there . how come there ? Do not know , it was all I boxed and labeled . Give me a spoon . This has been contaminated . I do not understand . How did it get there ? - I do not know . That 's really bad . How did it get there ? - I do not know . Department of Defense saw the damage first . Diagnosis will follow . Houston , do you hear ? There was no communication . - Just some noise . I saw some large craters . Five days , ten hours , 40 minutes since we left . Commander , Nathan Walker . EVA to 2 . Initiation of the second day of the recipient cell . PSD5 enable signal transmission . Houston , you hear us ? Here Liberty . Still no communication . There 's something in that frequency . Communication should not be out . Not so long ago . - Where are you going ? What is it ? Nate . - What is it ? Footprint . - What ? It 's impossible . They are not ours . Duration of mission : five days , 11 hours and seven minutes . Captain Anderson . Here 18 . Do you hear me . Houston , here 18 . Do you hear me ? John was in the back . There was no communication with him . Let 's see where they go . Crater impact . - Do you feel ? Yes , its temperature falls . Look at the footprints . This makes no sense . They walked around in circles . Puzzled . Why ? - I do not know . They go into this direction . Come here . This is a Russian . - What is it ? How can Russians to the moon , while no one knows ? We 're on the moon . While no one knows . Something was wrong . I 'll look into that . Lights off . Someone had run amok . Everything has been destroyed . Their system does not differ much from us . Electric lights . Good oxygen reserves . I can not tell whether they are fully operational . Where they claim to go ? - I do not know . I want to look around . - Stay around here . Russia could be anywhere . What 's this ? Here a lot of blood . Someone has been seriously injured . I do not like this . I think I saw something in the crater . I 'm down . Wait , Ben . His clothes were not resistant to cold like that . It 's okay , not so deep crater . It 's very cold . I 'll look around . The ground is different . It 's soft . Get out of there . It 's very cold . Get out , Ben . Well , I 'll go upstairs . There is a dead cosmonaut . I 'm going up . You okay ? - Yeah , I 'm going upstairs . What happened here ? Maybe another cosmonaut ? - Do you think killed him ? There 's a tear . - What are you doing ? Remove your hand from there . What is it ? It rocks . he was carrying when he was dragged out . I do not know . - Let 's get out of here . We 're almost at the deadline again . If we do not go , we die . I do not like this , someone has died . - I know . Is this line secure ? I just talk to you , Tommy ? That 's right . Russia has been on the moon . Tell me once again ? - Russia has landed at the South pole . We have found the LK Lander Proton them . Does not end well with the kosmonotnya . Did you already find the crash site - He did not fall . We found his body in the crater . - You find a dead cosmonaut ? Do not say you do not know anything about this ? We landed less than two miles from LK Russia . And you hope they do not know we were here ? We know they have 69 manned flights are canceled . This is the official message . Did you know they 're here ? It is the mission of the Department of Defense . I just told what I need to know . That 's all I can say . Tell the Department of Defense bastard , to contact me . Take a break . I would contact the Department of Defense and we 'll talk again , soon . Tommy 's honest . I knew from the beginning there was something strange . What do you think ? Department of Defense took over . Berbihing to our families . Then There is Russia here , for what ? installing wiretaps ? That 's crazy . Think about Watergate . That 's our president . And you do not think that the Department of Defense has berbong to us ? So what are we doing here ? What are we really doing here ? It 's a bit scary . A strange beauty in the back . I do not know if I 'm just imagining ... but every time I see out of this small window , it seems as if there is something to look back . You . Look at this . What ? - Look at that . Flag is lost . It is not possible . - Houston , here 18 . Houston , with Liberty . Did you notice anything unusual last night at the Westinghouse ? We found some damage . Our flag has disappeared . Repeat once more . Repeat once more . May be taken by the other cosmonauts . If nothing else , he 'll need oxygen for at least 12 hours . What do you think , John ? - It is simply not possible . He can not carry as much oxygen as it is . How can he survive ? Perhaps there is no " him " . - Russia flew one person here ? It was not the first time . - Only one cosmonaut . But who took the flag and kill the cosmonauts do we find ? Call the Department of Defense . Now . We expect the Soviets , but we have not yet confirmed . Intelligence warns us that they might disguise a routine mission with a satellite launch . Why did not you tell us ? Of national security . You will understand it . Perhaps too little . We are concerned that they be first . That would be a national security disaster . Where the other cosmonaut ? They leave behind ? The information that we get only a cosmonaut . It is time for you to return home . That 's it ? Home first , then ask . What is it ? - Let 's get out of here . Looks nice . Ten seconds . Ten seconds . Wait sinyalku . Eight ... - Time to go home . Seven , six ... That alarm . - We are not ready . Fix the damn thing . I tried . I have a power problem . Use a backup oxygen . We have some leakage . - I tried to isolate the tank . Houston , You can hear ? Houston , You can hear ? We lost communication . Communications is closed . No , no . - What happened ? Houston , Liberty here . We have just lost communication . How could that happen ? - Do not know . Clash of the LEM , or there is a meteor shower . Do not tell to do the EVA . I 'll see it . - Are you sure about this ? We need communication to get home . Wait here . Wear your shirt . Down from the platform . There is nothing under the stairs . Duration of mission : Six days . 13 hours , 46 minutes . Commander Walker did an unplanned EVA ... to fix the antenna on Roover . We 've experienced ... damage that can not be explained . The entire air system is somehow broken . This may occur because of collisions , but I do not see any marks meteorite . It 's torn up into small pieces . - Is there something ? I do not know . - We always get the same sound . Moving to a different frequency . - Do not . Already on the block . Something I 've never heard . Wait . Talk to me . What do you see ? There seems to be a trace . Footprints ? There may be other cosmonauts . Not Duration of mission : Six days , 13 hours , 47 minutes . Commander Nate Walker . We see that might be evidence of contact with alien beings . We see that might be evidence of contact with alien beings . Do you know what you said ? The trail is not human . I found the flag . Torn . And camera motion sensor has been lost . This one seems fine , just a little bump . I restore the position Roover . Connections look good . Try to contact the Houston or Freedom . Freedom , you can receive ? Houston , you can receive ? Damn it . No , it does not work . - Let me try something . Wait . There 's something moving . - What ? I do not see anything . - There 's something in my shirt . It 's on my helmet . Listen to me , return to LEM . - I do not get it out ! Back to the LEM . - I do not get it out ! No there is nothing in your clothes . Back . - It 's in my helmet . I do not get it out ! Oh my God . You need oxygen . Come on , continue the path . We 're almost there . Continue the path . Almost . To the front . Lift yourself . The door has been closed . Back cabin pressure automatically , 45 psi . You do not have enough oxygen . To breathe . One . Look at me , you 'll be fine . Two . Two and a half . Cabin pressure has stabilized . That 's all right . You okay ? Yes . What happened ? You start screaming , I went outside and take you away . Liberty , Freedom here . You can accept me ? Liberty , Freedom here . You can accept me ? Houston , here Freedom . You can accept me ? Yes , John . I can not contact the Liberty . - We had the same problem . Did you change the frequency ? - There may be interference from PSD5 ? We are not sure that 's the problem . What if we turn off their receivers ? we see what happens . Negative . Why not ? there are two of us , Tommy . Tommy ? You still there ? We 're overcome the problem . We will always tell you . Good . Damn it . Liberty , Freedom here . You can take me ? Duration of mission : Six days , 16 hours , 12 minutes . Interview with Commander Walker after he went outside . I 've told you all that I remember . I want to fix the antenna . I think I saw something ... I think I saw something in the corner of my eye . Apparently I was wrong ... and then there is the deafening sound , and I slipped . I may have hit a rock . That 's it . You say there is something on your helmet You 're shouting . I do not remember . You 're bleeding . Look at the shirt you . Jeez . Take the first aid equipment . You say there is something in your clothes . There , you say . You said in your helmet . How did you get that wound ? If there is something you get in clothing , where it has gone ? What do you think ? I can feel it here . There was something inside . What are you talking about ? - It was hard . I have to remove it . Quick . Hold . Damn , seems to be moving . Eject . I get . - Eject ! You okay ? What happened ? It looks like one sampelku . You said there was something moving in your helmet . I do not understand , how it ... Damn , you could ruin the whole plane . Liberty , you hear ? Liberty , you hear ? Houston , we hear you . Do you hear ? Yes , we hear you . Do you hear ? Do you hear ? They can not hear us . Liberty , say something . PSD5 it ... What if we are not here to spy on the Russians ? What do you mean ? They tell us to ... choose any frequency , it was not like that . They are blocking our communication . They send a signal . Why did they do that ? Do not , keep recording . We need this record . To attract something that makes you see the trail . Or what killed cosmonaut . All of these cameras , They are watching us . We are alone . We are the guinea pigs . That 's the reason they sent us here . We have to turn off the transmitter . PSD5 been destroyed . Good . There is a trail . They were just here . Let 's look at another area . Liberty , you can receive ? Liberty , you can receive ? Liberty , you can receive ? There 's something here . Have you lost What are you waiting for ? This is a bad idea . You need a break , Nate . We 're back . We 'll bring you back . Oh God , Nate . Included in your blood stream . Previous injuries seem to ... have been infected . The eyes look very red . I do not know how to treat it . Houston , here Freedom . I can not obtain the data . Communication with the Liberty is still not functioning . We can not communicate with the crew ... but we get the information from the LEM . We try to restore communication , Standby . Liberty , here in Houston . Apparently you heard us , but we do not . Block Westinghouse and health conditions are in the data . We estimate that you have 12 hours to support life in the LEM ... We examine the problem and the engine . We are doing everything possible and take you home . ... And we examine the problem machine . We 'll take you home . They lied . No , they 'll come pick us up . They want the recording . What about Russian aircraft ? - The Russian poor . Looks like it is infected . Just as I was . And getting worse . Ben , you must leave me here . - No No one leaves anyone . - You should do it . We will not die . Fate has brought us back on track . The people who go to the moon to find peace ... will remain on the moon , rest in peace . What are you talking about ? - I can feel my mind ... I felt their minds . I 'm very tired . Duration of mission : Six days , 22 hours , 23 minutes . Captain Anderson . Lose communication with Houston . Low oxygen levels . He slept for an hour . Pain was exhausted . We can not survive . If in the next few hours Houston did not find a solution ... We will leave Liberty and go to LK Russia . Communication and oxygen are our only hope . Just pray to God . Damn it . Jeez . Most of his stomach . Upper left ribs . The infection has spread . Damn it . This may also occur in people of Russia . Nate is my ... - I will not let you kill me . I. Look at me . I 'm just trying to help . You 're worse . Do not touch me anymore . Nate , what are you doing ? - They are everywhere . Please , you 're going to kill us all . - Stop watching us ! You will not see me die . What are you doing ? Stop . Stop . Stop it ! Liberty , Freedom here you can accept me ? Liberty , Freedom here . I do not know if you can hear me , but soon I will be in communication range . My friends , you should immediately get us out of here as soon as possible . Can you hear me ? Come on , folks , Do not leave us . Freedom , you can accept me ? John , do you hear ? Please anyone ? We left the Liberty . Come on . I have to do it . Take a camera . We require a 25 % per tank . We need backup . I have to make sure it can get to it . I have to bring this film ... and black boxes for the Department of Defense . We must go now . Is secure . Let 's go , Nate . They are everywhere . You can not help me . You should not be here . That 's all right . Everything will be fine . - We will be successful . They were waiting for me . We 're not safe here . Get rid of me . - Hold . What are you doing ? - Hold . Mission duration : I do not know ... Roover has been destroyed . I do not find Commander Walker . American astronaut , Ben Anderson of Apollo 18 . Increasingly depleted of oxygen . I 'm looking for LK 's Russia . I Commander Walker . Nate . Get out of there . From here they come . Nothing here . You must come with me . Damn , we should move . Listen to me . Our time is running out . You must find the LK . Their system just like us . Save yourself . No , you go with me .

They have forsaken me , John . Where is Nate ? How is the situation ? He did not succeed . There 's something here , John . And they know it . They already knew that . Forget the Department of Defense , friends . I 'll get you out of there , Ben . Can you fly that thing ? I do not have much choice . Strength looks good . And there is enough fuel . Okay , friends , not to dock normally , they could know . Go into the secret places carefully . May the survivors . How it sounds ? Beautiful . Very beautiful . I do not want to pressure you , but when we were little . bring it into orbit . We shall see . I understand , John . Seven . Six . Five . Damn it . - Open the door . Nate , I can not do . You can kill us both . I can not let go . I 'm going to go into . - No , no ! Do not do it , Nate ! Was it Nate ? - It 's Nate . We have to go . What happened ? - Please stop . Stop ! What happened ? - Do not . Oh my God . No ! No , no . You can glide . You must do it now . You 're running out of time . You must initiate the launch . Damn , we 're too close . We 're going home !

Do not try to save him . I repeat : Do not save him . Contaminated what ? Department of Defense ? What did you say ? where Tommy ? - You do not save Anderson . That 's a direct order . I 'm on the way . John , you were ordered to immediately cancel the rescue effort . Captain Anderson had been contaminated , do not be rescued . You know there is something there , but you still send them . I 'm going home . I 'm going home . Department of Defense to Freedom : If you do not cancel it in 60 seconds ... we will stop the transmission . You will not get updated data , life support , and you will not be able to go home . You have 45 seconds to cancel the rescue . John , we have no choice . We beg you , do not . Damn it . We will go home . I guess , I 'm already in orbit . Ben ! Get out of here ! Ben , you come too fast . Collision will occur . Slow ! Based on all the official reports , Apollo 17 was the last lunar mission The official report : Lt. Col. John Grey died in an accident when training in Tallahassee , Fla . his body was never found Official Report : F-14 Aircraft Commander Nathan Walker crashed in the pacific ocean near Kadena military base his body was never found The official report : Capt. Benjamin Anderson died in the evacuation of air over the East China Sea his body was never found We chose to go to the moon and the other . Not because it 's easy , but because it 's difficult . Apollo missions brought 840 pounds of moon rock samples to Earth Hundreds have been given to the several figures of foreign countries . Many of the " gifts " that have been stolen or lost . Apollo is a dramatic journey , has exceeded the risks . The men of Apollo is a great character , who can accept the dangers ... and can handle it . That 's the spirit that built America .

 You may begin . Remember , give these straight to your parents when you get home . Do not open them yourselves . Albert-Einstein Cole . Nicola-Tesla Hertz . Marie-Curie Fortune . Thank you . Theodor-Adorno Strauss . What did you get ? - 127 . - Don 't go higher than 100 . Hey ! I only got a 67 , but ... I 'm so Relieved , really . It could have been so much lower . - Meet my friend . - You don 't have any friends . This is Isaac-Newton Midgeley . - Zak . Hello . - Hello . He 's ... minus seven . Always knew I didn 't like you . - Thought he was your friend . - Shut up and wait . What for ? Super-High frequency meets Super-Low frequency . So that should be happening , some ... reaction . Interesting . Come on in , Zak . Your mother 's here . - Now , Zak ! - Coming , Mrs. Cook . How long ? Exactly one minute . - Daughter . - Father . So ... You know what this means . How it will change your life ? Yes . How do you feel about it ? I 'm so relieved , really . It could have been so much lower . Obviously , this is great news , and we 're very keen ... to make sure that Marie fulfills her potential . Is that not guaranteed , now ? Is there anything we can do about her emotional- - Her emotions ? It 's a common side effect . The higher the frequency , the lower the empathy . One tends to drive out the other . The luckier we are , the less we care about it . And no one 's going to be luckier than Marie . No , it doesn 't appear so . There are certain things we can try- - Knowledge does determine destiny , after all . I don 't want her to be an experiment . We want her to ... make friends , have fun , fall in love , have a normal life . Oh ! I 'm sorry , but you must understand ... that won 't be at all possible . If you want to find true love , stop here . If you want to find true love , stop here . If you want to find true love , stop here . If you want to find true love , stop here . - Hello , Miss . Anderson . - Hello , Marie . If you want to find true love- - Well , I 've stopped . This analyzes your precise frequency . I developed a way to directly read the waveform- - much more efficient than the old school test . - You have the patent for that ? - Of course . It 's now cross-referencing men and women with compatible resonance . Only a small sample- - Just the teachers that would let me take their reading this morning . That 's how you define true love ? That 's how nature defines it . Those with the lower frequencies need a minimum of 700 signifiers . Of course , there are natural forces to repel , not attract . What are your plans for this project ? Father wants to put it on the market . Apparently , people are obsessed about finding true love . And you ? No one 100 percents , but there is a 95 . And who is that ? Mr. Thales . Really ? ! Maybe you should go and say hello . All extra data is useful . This ... device has many possible applications ... - such as the ability to find friends . - Of course . - Just a different set of signifiers . - And have you tested this aspect yourself ? No . Everybody wants to be my friend . But how many actually are your friends ? None . Then I believe it is necessary for you to give it a try . All extra data is useful . Sorry I 'm late . Got locked in a corridor . Interesting . - Hello . - Hello . - Did you see the- - - I was going to say ... - Yes . - ... we don 't have to speak . It 's just that- - I want to . I mean , We 're probably not gonna get more than a minute . Sorry ... - How are you ? - Greeting or serious question ? - Greeting . - Fine . How are you ? Bit worried about what 's going to happen . Maybe nothing will happen . If that 's true , then ... why are they here ? Why don 't you ask them ? Why me ? Because you and I supposed to have the most interesting reaction . How long ? - 50 seconds . - What happens if it goes past a minute ? Detention , both of you . - Separately . - It 's okay . They 've used up their minute for this year already . We couldn 't get them together now if we tried . Why do it ? You know what happens when you two get together . You want to put Zak in danger ? This is a health-and-safety issue for the whole school . Come on . - Do you like him ? - It 's just an experiment . It 's a false experiment . Frequency does not change . Don 't waste your ... feelings on this boy . The two of you are just not destined to be together . Knowledge determines destiny , Miss . Anderson . Hello . Hello . If it goes past a minute , maybe frequency isn 't fixed . Sorry ? You asked what would happen if it goes past a minute . I 've decided we should talk . Did anyone see you ? No , I don 't think so . Good . We 're alone . Less chance of something happening . How are you ? Not so good , actually . I think I 've got the flu . I need a more specific answer . Imagine your physical state and emotions to my research . I thought you might be . Well , I 'm feeling ... tense , nervous , breathless ... sweaty . Because you 're worried about what might happen ? That 's part of it . Are you okay ? Fine . I 've got an idea . - Hello . - Hello . - What was your idea ? - I think we should ... touch . You know , as part of the data collection . I think we should touch . I can 't . - Why not ? - Because it changes the variables . - We haven 't touched , so- - - We should never touch ? - Yes . - It could be a new experiment , - A better experiment . - What are you talking about ? - Would you- - - It 's not that I don 't want to touch . What if it wasn 't just for data collection ? What do you mean ? I 've got to ask you something . Yes ? - Hello . - Hello . Will you go to graduation with me ? Graduation 's not till next year . I don 't get many opportunities to ask . We 're supposed to be keeping this quiet . But this isn 't data collection . - This is a date . - A one-minute date ? I 've been on shorter ones before . Low frequency , remember ? - Yes . - Yes ? I think we should touch then , as well . Think about it . - Hello . - Hello . Where do you want to touch me ? Everywhere . Sorry , that sounds a bit wrong . I know we can 't be together , but ... I need to tell you ... I love you . I know you probably don 't love me , but I just ... hope that you like me , you know ? Serious question ? Yes . No . What about our meetings ? - Data collection . - Just data collection ? No , I 've also been experimenting with flirting . And now I 've stopped . You really don 't feel anything for me ? I don 't think you understand , Zak . I don 't feel . No one wants to understand . I know what they call me . The Machine . And they 're right . I do not love my family . I experience no joy . If you ever see me smile , frown , laugh or cry , I 'm pretending ... waiting for it to become real . But it never will . It 's the side effect . The side effect . Of course . The two of us are just not destined to be together . Well , look at that . One minute . Looks like I 'm leaving right on time . Hello . It 's not due in for another week , but I 'll just go check for you , okay ? Would you look at that- - It 's Just arrived . That 'll be 20 pounds exactly , please . - Isn 't that lucky ? - Isn 't it ? Surprise ! Happy birthday , Marie . Hello . Hello . Zak . It 's been a long time . Where did you get to ? Everywhere . Sao Paulo , Buenos Aires , Kaichi , Kinshasa , But most recently , Vilnius . I can now curse convincingly in 18 languages . Where 's Kaichi ? I 've not heard of it . Relax . You don 't have to pretend to care . - How are you ? - Greeting or serious question ? - Serious question . - Still the machine . - Still broken . - Still waiting ? Waiting , pretending , but now , I think , so is everyone else . - Why are you here ? - To continue the experiment , of course . - Nothing 's changed . - Not for you . - What 's changed for you , Zak ? - Look at your watch . Over a minute . I can 't stay . But meet me in the train shop tomorrow at 7 : 00 . I think I can help you . Glad you could make it . - Expecting a call ? - Yes . How did you last more than a minute ? I changed my frequency . You know that 's not possible . Knowledge determines destiny . You did this ? - You found the solution ? - Yes . - Does that surprise you ? - Yes . You are Low-Frequency . Not anymore . What we know about frequency is wrong . Otherwise , you and I would never have met . You said you could help me . I can change your frequency . - Lower it ? - I don 't think it gets much higher . But nature works hard to give me everything . Almost everything . Tell me the process . Okay , I don 't think you 're gonna like it . Essentially , it 's an energy exchange . I 'll be bringing you down ... a lot closer to my level . There are a lot of processes at work , but ... one of them is ... me ... touching you . Clever . The negative feedback loop should eventually be self-reinforcing , but ... I will need to be physically close to you for a while . Very clever . - How soon will I see results ? - If it works as I hope it should , instantly . You want to do it- - I can tell . Please don 't lie . Vuren 's sake . You will have feelings for the first time in your life . Theoretically . Is it reversible ? It should be . But there are no guarantee . That 's it ? The main part . It might not work . I 've decided you can talk if you want . Thanks . It 's weird , talking to you without a deadline . Or ... not talking . Are you okay ? - I don 't think I 'm feeling very well . - Feeling ? Feeling physically sick is not an emotion . But that 's not this feeling . This is ... This is it . This is ... awful . - I feel a huge weight . - I think that 's just nerves . It 's intense . I feel ... connected to myself . - How does that feel ? - Not so good . It definitely feels better when we 're touching . Why is that ? Because ... Unith . You love me . Maybe . Where ? I think nature 's rebelling . Just like old times . Should we do anything ? No , it should settle down , the longer we spend together . Eesa . - I know what I want to try . - What ? - Kiss me . - Really ? Don 't make me ask again . I 'm used to getting what I want . I 'm not . - I like her . - You like everybody . She smiled at me . She smiles a lot . I think mine 's wrong . Meet my friend . This is Isaac-Newton Midgeley . Zak . Hello . Obviously , this is not great news , and we cannot force the choice upon you , but we are very strongly recommending ... that Zak be placed in a school better suited to help him fulfill his potential . Because , according to you , he has no potential . But a special school ? Can nothing be done ? I know that it is difficult , but you and Zak have to accept the fact that he has abnormally Low-Frequency . So ? He 'll be a little unlucky . Mrs. Midgeley , we need to be clear on this . Zak is a negative . This is very rare , but it means that he is literally ... out of sync with the natural world . He will be beyond unlucky . He will never be in the right place at the right time . He will never fit in , apart from with those of his own kind . He no longer belongs here . That 's not our opinion . That 's scientific fact . - He is gifted . - He 's a genius . But , unfortunately , surrounded by prodigies . Perhaps we should ask Zak what what he wants . Is this what you want , Zak ? Do you really want to stay here ? - Yes . - Good . Good boy . Now , you 're going to need help , so don 't be afraid to ask for it . Okay ? All knowledge that exists is known in only two ways- - Inductively and deductively . Inductive reasoning moves from specific details and observations ... to the underlying principles that explain them . Observation of nature is the authority . By contrast , deductive reasoning moves from general truths to specific conclusions . - Oh . Hello . Is Theo in ? - You must be Zak , yes ? Come in . Theo , Zak 's here ! Don 't worry . - I always come at a bad time . - Nonsense . I 'm sorry for the discord . Concertos can be such messy things , can 't they ? Take a seat . Theo has told us all about you . Tell me , Zak . Do you play ? No . People like me have a problem with rhythm . Tosh . Everybody can play something . Everybody . All you need is heart , soul , and a little imagination . You have those ? Play any three notes . Play them at any time , for any length , in any order . - I like the patterns . - Progressions . I can see them . Then you just might be a player . - Hello , Theo . - What 's up ? I 've got an extra homework project . I need a little help . Now , to start . This is you . And this is Marie . You resonate on an Ultra-Low frequency . She resonates on an Ultra-High . And this is what happens when you get together . You repel like two High-powered magnets . If you want any chance with Marie , that 's the problem we have to solve . - Can I have the chalk ? - What have you seen ? I 've seen a pattern . What is it , Zak ? Sorry , Miss . - Not ready , Zak ? - I was , but then- - Every time , Zak . Not every time , Miss . Just most times . Can 't blame frequency for everything . No , Miss . They say that inventions mirror their inventors , and yours is a mess , Zak . So , what do we have here , Theo ? A simulation game ? That 's more fun . A simulation , but not a game . A reflection , a sim of life . - Whose ? - Everyone 's . You 've modeled it on this world ? We know it is mathematically possible for one rule , constantly repeated , to create seemingly random results . My hypothesis is that all life is not random . I believe that one rule is at work- - One equation , one set of actions that acted on the first element of matter ... - and keeps acting on it . - Fascinating . Life seems chaotic , but in fact , it 's just an infinitely complex pattern . You realize you are searching for the code to life ? It 's not perfected yet , but- - If what you 're saying is right , then it assumes that we are simply complex machines , that we may not have a soul , certainly not any free will . I 'm sorry . Are they important ? Okay . I 'll go along with it for now ... Though if this is real , you 'll be able to tell me what 's going to happen next , won 't you ? Of course . Just the next five minutes . In about seven seconds , Nicola-Tesla 's gonna come over . In about 31 seconds , Zak is gonna cross the room . And in precisely two minutes , the fire alarms are gonna sound . Miss . Anderson , I 've just seen Thomas-Edison 's project , and I think he 's stolen my idea . - Impressive . - Thank you . Miss . Anderson . You told her to do this . Go away , Nicola . Miss . Anderson ! Not now . Go on , Zak . It 's clearly part of the plan . We leave the Low-Frequencies . Pass the Medium-Low . Through the mediums . 'scuse me .. Excuse me . Now just through the High-Frequencies . Zak ! - Hi , mom . - Why are you not at your stand ? This is important ! Come on . You almost had me . I have a sense of humor like everyone else , but I 'm disappointed that you 've decided to play games ... instead of taking this fair seriously . It 's not a game . Hi . Hi . I was wondering ... would you like to meet me after school ? - Say " Thank you " . - Thank you . Best I could do at short notice . It 's got the highest measurable remanence . If anything can disrupt your frequency , this can . At last , I 'm attractive . Well , only to metal- - An unfortunate side effect . Everything has a side effect . My whole life 's a side effect . You think it 'll work ? No . Are you wearing anything metal ? We just wanted to see the experiment . Sorry I 'm late . Got locked in a corridor . Hello . The latest recipe . - Say " Thank you " . - Thank you . Oh , and , remember to try not to throw up . Good . We 're alone . How are you ? It 's not that I don 't want to touch . A one-minute date ? Yes . I do not love my family . I experience no joy . If you ever see me smile , frown , laugh or cry , I 'm pretending ... waiting for it to become real . And it never will . It 's the side effect . The side effect . Of course . Look at that . One minute . Looks like I 'm leaving right on time . The two of us are just not destined to be together . Irony- - The indirect presentation of a contradiction ... between an action or expression and the context in which it occurs . Ironic particle- - The physical manifestation of irony , existing latent in every atom in the universe . But my preliminary research suggests ... that the ironic particles are only activated by the brain ... when we want something , and so forming ... a Desire chain . But only by a certain type of person . - A Low-Frequency person . - Yes . My research indicates that only they are susceptible to irony . Is not irony in the eye of the beholder ? Yes , but the beholder is the individual involved , hence the Desire chain . In everyday terms , it 's why they never get what they really want . But my hypothesis , and the purpose of the research grant ... I 'm hoping you 'll give me , is that it is possible to reverse this effect . The mental changes the physical . It 's all about patterns . The first stage is to want something , recognize the potential irony , and then to change your Desire chain . Sorry to interrupt , but that sounds suspiciously like you 're trying to fool fate ... and I just don 't think that 's possible . Well ... I do , Sir . Hi . This is Theo . You know what to do . Hey . It 's me . I feel like having a drinking session tonight , so as usual , any assistance you can provide would be gratefully appreciated . - Doctor Zak . - Doctor Theo . Brought supplies . Say " Thank you " . So , what 's on the menu ? Our latest test substances from the research lab ... all with very interesting side effects . To side effects . To side effects . - Too much tea . - Too much ... " Midenzobetritate " . - Any change ? - Not yet . Give me another three . Sorry . Right . So , we 're mixing three Pyridinecarboxamide ... with Tetracotinate Triptothol . What was that ? A fluctuation . An upward fluctuation . - You 're sure ? - Yes ! - But it didn 't last long . - Any effect should last hours . Maybe it 's not the drugs . Another variable . But what else has changed ? Let 's repeat the last 60 seconds . - Too much tea . - Too much Midenzobetritate . - Any change ? - No , not yet . Give me another three . Sorry . Right , so , we 're mixing three Pyridinecarboxamide ... with Tetracotinate Triptothol . Triptothol . Cotina- - Sound waves . But sound waves was the first thing everyone tried . It 's not just the waves . It 's the words . But the effect only lasts a moment . So ... some fine-tuning needed , then . Sign here , please . Thank you . Remember , it 's a trial run . You 've got 65 seconds , then get out . It 'll get easier each time . Victan . Back in a minute ... more or less . Victan . Hello . Hello . - Zak . - It 's been a long time . - Where did you get to ? - Kaichi . Oh , everywhere . - Sao Paulo , - Kaichi - Buenos Aires , Kaichi , Kinshasa . But most recently , Vilnius . I can now curse convincingly in 18 languages . Where 's Kaichi ? I 've not heard of it before . Relax . You don 't need to pretend to care . Solas . Solas . Glad you could make it . Expecting a call ? - Yes . - How did you last more than a minute ? - I changed my frequency . - You know that 's not possible . Knowledge determines destiny . You did this ? You found the solution ? Yes . - Does that surprise you ? - Yes . You are Low-Frequency . Not anymore . What we know about frequency is wrong . Otherwise , you and I would never have met . You said you could help me . I can change your frequency . - Lower it ? - I hardly think it gets much higher . But nature works hard to give me everything . - Almost everything . - Tell me the process . It 's ... - Okay . - Okay . I don 't think you 're gonna like it . Essentially , it 's an energy exchange . I 'll be bringing you down a lot closer to my level . There are a lot of processes at work , but one of them ... is me ... - touching you . - Clever . The negative feedback loop should eventually be self-reinforcing , but ... I will need to be physically close to you for a while . Very clever . How soon will I see results ? If it works as I think it should , instantly . - You want to do it . I can tell . - Please don 't lie . Vuren . Vuren 's ... sake . You will have feelings for the first time in your life . Theoretically . Is it reversible ? It should be . But there are no guarantees . That 's it ? The main part . It may not work . I 've decided you can talk if you want . Thanks . It 's weird , talking to you without a deadline . Or- - Or not talking . - Are you okay ? - I don 't think I 'm feeling too well . - Feeling ? - Feeling physically sick is not an emotion . But that 's not this feeling . This is ... awful . I feel a huge weight . I think that 's just nerves . It- - It 's intense . I feel ... connected to myself . - How does that feel ? - Not- - Not so good . It definitely feels better when we 're touching . Why is that ? Because ... - Unith . - Unith . You love me . Maybe . - Where . - Where ? - I think nature 's rebelling . - Just like old times . - Should we do anything ? - No . It should settle down , the longer we spend together . - Eesa . - Eesa . - I know what I want to try . - What ? - Kiss me . - Really ? Don 't make me ask again . I 'm used to getting what I want . I 'm not . Do you want to come in and touch some more ? Can I ? - Do you think ... maybe ... - Yes ? You could go a bit faster ? I want it to be special . You think I 'm a virgin ? I 've conducted many experiments . And ... your conclusions ? Sex is like masturbation , just with someone else . I hope not . You 're a virgin . Of course . I may not have conducted many experiments , but I have ... studied very , very hard . Mentha . Open it . - I 'm sorry . - Don 't be . We were raised to have a burning curiosity . Open it . I don 't understand . Is it some sort of code ? Sometimes a tick is just a tick . I have a 210 I.Q. I never needed to take notes . I just didn 't want to have to always look at people ... or have them looking at me . It 's the eyes . I could never read people 's eyes- - not- - not like other people- - and ... if they looked into mine for too long , they 'd realize- - Was that our train ? Welcome to my world . Are you okay ? I 've never waited for a train before . It 's not all bad , though . So , where are we going ? - Daughter . - Father . - Daughter 's friend . - Sorry about the state of the place . We 're having some work done . So , Zak , how have you been since you left school ? A serious question , or polite conversation ? Polite conversation . Very well , Mrs. Fortune . Call me Hettie , Zak . And yourself , Hettie ? Fine , dear . Just fine . What is this , mother ? Since when have we done small talk ? Since when have you brought a boy home ? Ask him . Ask him . You 're not really having any work done , are you ? You still think something bad 's gonna happen . You don 't believe that Zak solved anything because he 's Low-Frequency . - It 's just a precaution . - Relax . Nothing will happen , and then we can discuss why . But how did you do it ? I mean , I did some research myself , long ago when Marie was young . It seemed impossible . - Words . - Words ? - The right words . - What ? Magic words ? We think so , me and Theo . You remember Theodor-Adorno ? He 's been helping me . We discovered a link between synaptic function and resonance . The way you think affects your frequency . Think lucky , and you 'll be lucky . Not quite . The synapses need to be manipulated in a certain way . These are you- - All High-Frequency . And this is the world . And this is me . Now , what the words do is this . - Well , that 's never happened before . - Spilling some water ? Marie spilling anything . - What have you done to my daughter ? - What I asked him to do . Let me explain . Me . Marie . Now , this is how the words work . - You steal people 's frequencies ? - It 's just physics . They balance the environment . In actuality , what really happens is this . Both the vibrations of the sound waves ... and the words themselves create the effect . It 's a new type of quantum entanglement . Mental and physical processes at work simultaneously . Like dominos , and each person affected affects the next , - ultimately adjusting- - - The whole world . He 's the only one that can make me Normal . I 'm the only one that can make him Normal . It 's unnatural . But it 's reversible . The natural order reverts itself very quickly . One word can change the world . Not one . Nature needs constant nurturing . What- - you have to keep saying them ? Yes , but less and less often because- - because you are like a Low-Frequency organ in a High-Frequency body ... - A virus ! - ... and the word prevents rejection . Yes , but the words constantly change as the environment constantly changes . - We worked out a rough formula of sound- - - How do you monitor the changes ? It 's a modification of Marie 's frequency analyzer . It measure the changes in the room ... and then formulates a word that I should say to balance the environment . It 's still in beta . Can I ? If the world is a maze , this is the map . Do you realize what you 've done ? Made me happy . I mean , this could be the most important discovery of all time ! There 's still so much about it we don 't know . It levels the playing field . I mean , think what would happen if everybody uses it- - No lucky , no unlucky , true balance in the universe for the first time . An end to war . Justice for all . Have you got a patent ? Hi . This is Theo . You know what to do . Hey , it 's Zak . Good news , we 're meeting tomorrow at Fortune 's lab . Call me when you get this . It really is extremely small . Zak ! Zak , come in . You know my research team , I believe . Sorry . No , I don 't think we 've- - Nicola-Tesla Hertz . Nicola-Tesla . Oh , my God . And Thomas-Edison Gates . Sit . Sit . - How do you feel ? - Great . We 've been trying to improve the range of Marie 's frequency analyzer for years , so we 'd love to know how you did it . That was actually Theo . I know that if you pointed it 45 degrees to the subject , that helps , but he dealt with most of the hardware . I think I love you . And this is how we detect imbalance and formulate the sounds , although we still don 't know why they all seem to be two syllables . I ... think I love you , too . I ... believe I need more empirical evidence . How- - How does this love manifest itself ? Whatever you ask , I 'll do . - Anything ? - Yeah . And you ? I wouldn 't do anything for you . Spellings are phonetic , but the words are only approximations , which is why the earpiece is still necessary . In this case , the word to balance frequencies is " Rana " . So far , there have been no words that are impossible for a human to pronounce , but there 's still so much we don 't know . So , you wouldn 't do anything for me , then ? No . Onro . Not even kneel on the floor and call me " Master " . Master . Everybody , stop . It 's arrived . Just wait till this hits the market . Why did I do that ? I had to do that . What- - What do I not want to do ? I don 't want to leave this room . I don 't want to fly a plane . What would you normally not do ? - I told you , if you asked , I 'd do anything . - Don 't disrupt the experiment . What 's against character for you ? - Any kind of violence . - Fabulous . Kera . Slap me hard around the face . It must be love . It seems you discovered a side effect . We 're categorizing them as adjustments for now . Whatever you ask someone to do after you say one of these , they 'll do . Anything ? And it doesn 't have to be something they say immediately . As far as we can tell , the influence can be short , medium , or potentially long-term . The words trigger all neurotransmitters to work together , making the suggestion irresistible . How ? We don 't know . - Is there a pattern to these words ? - No . Apart from the fact that they 're always the last on the list . Oh , everywhere- - Sao Paulo , Buenos Aires , Kaichi . I can 't explain it . I can now curse convincingly in 18 languages . He must know . He 's lying . Not quite . - The synapses must be manipulated in a certain way . - No . For Vuren 's sake , you 'll have feelings for the first time in your life . - Maybe we 've got the wrong inventor . - No . - Where is Theo ? - I don 't know . He doesn 't know anything . I knew he couldn 't have done it ! He 's Low-Frequency ! Unith . Well , we 'll have to abandon the launch permanently greater ... You love me . No . He did it . He made me feel like this . - He told me . - What ? He told me to love him . No , it- - it must have been an accident . Like- - Like she said , It- - It 's a side effect . I said the first word on the list . You have to believe me ! If we believe you , then you are just a fool who got lucky . If we don 't you are a lying genius . I 'm sure you 'll appreciate the irony . - Hi . This is Theo . You know what to do . - Where are you ? ! The side effects . What have you done ? You must sign . It must be suppressed . - I want to see Marie . - I 'm sure you do . - Tell her I can fix this . - Can you ? Soon , everything will be back to normal . - You have reached the Messae bank of ... - Marie-Curie Fortune . ... And I 'm currently unable to take your call . Please leave a short message at the tone . Hi . This is Theo . You know what to do . If you want to find true love , stop here . If you want to find true love , stop here . - Thank you . You have reached the messae bank of ... Checking . - Three matches found . - You know what to do . Helen Malzin . 85 Germany Single Would you like to contact ? Laura Warwick . 34 England Married Would you like to contact ? - Please leave a short messae at the tone . - Ana Della Matta . 24 America Deceased Would you like to contact ? Marie-Curie Fortune . - What- - - Please . Do not speak . But please also do not be alarmed . We 're just your friendly local-government agency . Not one of yours . One of ours . We 're here to ask you three questions . Nod for " Yes " , shake for " No " . Mumyad . Did you steal this technology ? Sirah . Did you leak the device 's program or schematics ? Visten . Do you have any plans of any kind ... to manipulate the world ? You may speak now . Those words make me tell the truth ? - Yes . - But how do you know they work ? I 've done this before . Now , how would you like a job ? The hours are terrible , but you do get free room and board . As of now , you are all officially government employees ... and bound by the official secrets act . Your task is to find a way to neutralize the threat ... which the technology known as " The Manual " poses to this country . In front of you , you 'll find a file which contains all the information ... we have on the subject and an historical account ... of what happened the last time it was in the public domain . You have stumbled upon very old technology , mostly lost to us , fortunately . The remnants are always kept top secret and are analyzed for generations ... with little success . And then , inevitably , elements are rediscovered ... by the general population , and chaos ensues . You 've heard the stories- - Wizards , witches . The mastery of the tech was what first established the ruling classes ... and was the main contributing factor to most wars until 1066 . We don 't know why . It had a steep decline in its effectiveness from about 1100 . That last known date of any successful usage was about 1760 . We don 't know why . And now it 's out there again . Thank you all . But I 'm sure you 'll find a way to put it back . The ground rules- - If you say or even semi-utter a word that is not immediately recognizable , you will be arrested , gagged , and ... potentially tried for treason . Thomas , you look at physical solutions , Nicola , linguistic solutions . Marie and I will look at the program itself ... to see if we can 't unlock a few more secrets . - What about me ? - You don 't work for me . You can do what you like . What about ... Maybe . But what if we ... I know this might sound ridiculously simple ... but why don 't we just work on some kind of earplug ? That 'll only make it worse . What you need is something like this . No . You 're all wrong . What you need is something like this . Oh , that 's very dangerous , daughter , at that speed . It needs to be quick . The quicker this is all over , the better . How about ... It would work ... because it would kill most of the population . Why don 't ... we make an Anti-Manual ? Because that would take decades . I don 't mean a real one . The biggest problem here is that people actually believe The Manual works . Panic causes chaos . So , some kind of placebo ? It would buy us time . Or we- - we could distribute flawed copies of The Manual ... and then discredit the whole technology a few weeks later . That 's very devious . It is , but if it works , we should use it . It should be possible to use The Manual to convince people not to use The Manual . I mean , it- - it would be like having inoculations at school . Everyone would be instructed never to use it ... or to forget it . Why don 't we treat the actual problem of The Manual and not its symptoms ? Does it matter ? If it works ... There 's probably a very simple solution that we all just haven 't seen . Nature works in patterns . Usually , the cure is very close to the disease . - Like stinging nettles and dock leaves . - Yes . Maybe there are antidote words . Oh , dear . We 're calling them " Shortcuts " . They don 't need a command to follow them . They are the command . What do they do ? Permission to speak one of them , Mr. Bridges ? They commands are all harmless , and no effects last more than a minute . Okay . Korlo . That means " Sit " . And the others mean " Stop " and " Go " . We seem to have hit on some basic motor functions , but ... the effects seem short-lived and cannot be used twice in the same hour . A lot of damage can be done in an hour . Obviously , these words are banned now . Did you know about this ? - Hello . - Hello . I was thinking , what you said before ... about convincing people not to use The Manual . Tell me I have no feelings for you . Adjust me . They let you have that ? For experimentation . Command me . I don 't know how . I probably don 't need to do anything . Now that I 'm not using it anymore , things should go back to normal pretty quickly . Oh , they have . I can feel myself feeling less . But not for you . Don 't touch me . I 'm sure I can fix this . I know . I love you . But only because you 've told me to . Cruel , isn 't it ? Maybe you would have loved me anyway . - Now we 'll never know . - Does it matter ? - You have to have choice . - Do you if it works ? Do it ! Do it for me . - Maybe someone else can . - No , I 've already tried . It has to be you . I 'm just gonna say the last word on the list . I don 't know if it 'll work . Endel . You do not love me . Nothing 's changed . Time 's up . I need to speak to Mr. Midgeley alone . Two minutes . - It 's just not meant to be for us , is it ? - No . It 's just not meant to be for you . Can you confirm that this is yours ? I can . - Our top people have had a look at it . - And ? They think it 's brilliant . We think it 's time you stopped all this . It 's clear you have a history of obsession with ... manipulation . No , just irony . You are prohibited from speaking under any circumstances ... while we decide precisely how to deal with you . - But- - - Under any circumstances . The side effects . Side effects . The side effects . It can 't be . I know I 'm not supposed to talk , but I need to speak to Bridges . No communication , or you 'll be shot . No communicating by any means . ... To be concidered TREASON BY ANY INDIVIDUAL Kevet . Don 't worry . The effects should only last a minute . - Zak ? - I know . It 's your protection , isn 't it ? It 's why it 's always around , isn 't it ? Am I right ? Yes . Then you have to help me . They won 't let me speak . You must tell them . Must I ? I must . They know your frequency 's reestablished itself . They know what happens when we 're together . Clever . They know that we should only have one minute , - ... that fate should push you out . - Very clever . What if they 're wrong ? They 're going to break down the door after one minute and five seconds . They 're wrong . - What ? - Not yet . I have no desire to repeat myself . You 're Theo 's father , aren 't you ? Tell me . Tell me ! Tell me ! - Nobody say a word . - On the ground . On the ground ! No talking from anybody . - He knows something . - No talking ! - He knows something . - No talking ! What does he know ? What are you doing ? Giving you what you want , what Zak here has worked out- - The antidote . And the antidote is ? Music . Well , don 't take my word for it . Try a word . Korlo . - Is it special music ? - Well , kind of . It 's mozart . Listen , gentlemen ... and ladies . When mozart plays , we are all the same frequency . A brief history lesson . A secret history . There was never any magic , only just the book being lost and found , being written , being rewritten , being burned , being used to control the masses . And then ... came the music . We knew from early on that music held some power , some power to free us . You 've heard of the pied piper , I have no doubt . Composer- - literally " To Come " . The first composers weren 't writing simply to entertain . They were writing to give us control of our minds back . With each new piece , the book was weakened , until ... Mozart . 1760 . His first composition , the first piece that truly immunized us against the book . Since then , there 've been many . When you recognize a melody you 've never heard before , that 'll be one , tapping into our collective subconscious . Most complex music just interferes enough with the book to make it unreliable and , so , useless . Why was it a secret ? It wasn 't . It just fell out of history by mutual consent . There were rulers who still harbored thoughts of using the book again , and the masses didn 't take too kindly to being reminded they are just mechanisms- - Complex , certainly , but mechanisms with buttons to push , nonetheless . Music- - it 's the reset button . Where is that , precisely ? The soul . And what happens when the music stops ? Oh , it can never stop . Why do you not talk to her ? I ... can 't . You can . It is a bit of a surprise . We expected his frequency to be above average , but it is exactly average , to 10 decimal places . The time has come for you to learn some family history . So , why don 't we tell them ? Because the masses prefer not to be self-aware , which by choice , puts them on a level with all their cousins in the animal kingdom . Want some flakes ? Say " Thank you " . - Maybe this isn 't your instrument . - But it was perfect . Look , for hundreds of years , we have been the players , Theo , interpreting the score , evolving it . Where 's the life ? Where 's the inspiration ? Where 's the ... spontaneity ? If we are all machines , then everything is decided . Spontaneity is an illusion . No . We still have free will . We still have souls . We still have imagination . Theo , Zak 's here . What is it ? A code , I extrapolated from Mozart . It lays underneath all his work , invisible . I thought all this time you were writing music . I-I believe it 's the code to the- - that ... governs everything . This universe comes from one simple code repeating infinitely , making it infinitely complex but utterly predictable . But it 's not perfect yet . I-I 'm still working on it . If this is real , then it assumes that we are simply complex machines , that we may not have a soul , certainly not any free will . I 'm sorry . Are they important ? Okay . I 'll go along with it for now . Though , if this is real , you 'll be able to tell me what 's going to happen next , won 't you ? Just the next five minutes . In about five seconds , Nicola-Tesla 's gonna come over . And in 31 seconds , Zak is gonna cross the room . And in precisely two minutes , The fire alarm 's gonna sound . Two minutes . No alarm . - Two minutes , seven seconds . - I told you , it 's not perfected yet . You almost had me . I have a sense of humor like everyone else , but I 'm disappointed ... that you 've decided to play games rather than taking this fair seriously . It 's not a game . Thank you . Have a gift . Open it . I think you 've been working too hard . You need a hobby , a pet . I quite agree . - Say " Thank you " . - Thank you . Oh , hey , it 's me . Yeah , I 'm thinking of having a drinking session around 9 : 00 tonight . As usual , any assistance you can provide would be gratefully appreciated . - Any change ? - Not yet . Give me another three . Sorry . I see you 've taught him some new tricks . - They 're going to ask . - Who ? Ask what ? Everyone . Ask ... for our help from the book . And they 're going to ask you specifically , and you 're going to tell them . I would say it was a gift , but it- - it really has nothing to do with me . Oh , turn off the music now . Oh , sorry . Sorry about that . Technology 's never been my strongpoint , but we 're all getting used to this , aren 't we ? Your test results are back . Well , there 's no need to worry , either of you . It just means that we 'll have to start with stronger doses to begin with . Zak , this is a course of Mozart and Brahms . Marie , Pachelbel , once daily . So ... what I 'm feeling now ... is it real ? From what we now know , what you feel is not due to any form of manipulation , but further than that , I- - I cannot comment . You 're perfectly normal . For a machine . Nothing to say , father ? If you 're right , then you 've seen this conversation already . It 's not physically possible for me to watch every conversation , but ... yes . You know precisely what I 'm going to say ? Yes . Then tell me what happens . - So , how do you feel ? - Like the luckiest girl in the world . - You are the luckiest girl in the world . - I was . What are you thinking ? You 're going to tell me that you don 't think I 'll ever perfect the equation , that free will is not an illusion , that creativity and improvisation do exist . I- - I disagree with you . But I 'm not interested in individual destinies . What I am interested in is the universal ... symphony . You always got whatever it was you wanted , didn 't you ? And what was it you wanted more than anything else in the world ? Feelings . To be in love . So , what are you saying- - that nature created you for me , someone to give me what I wanted ? I tell you that when the equation is perfect , I will know the true pattern . You ask me what good that will do . I tell you , " Knowledge is useless if you only know parts- - There can be no truth . Everyone else will know only pieces . Only I will know ... everything . " That would mean neither of us had a choice . You ask me if I don 't miss surprises . I tell you that although I might get the score , there is still the joy in watching the performance . This is the part where I say goodbye , isn 't it ? Yes . Hello . Hello . Goodbye . Goodbye . If you 're right ... If I 'm right , it means that whatever gave us our minute wasn 't love ... It was fate . It means I 'm just here to serve a purpose for you . It means everything 's already decided . There 's no freedom , no responsibility , and knowledge absolutely does not determine destiny . Yes . Does it matter ? No . Not to me . Me neither . That 's it . Perfect . I see .

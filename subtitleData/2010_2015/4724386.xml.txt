The cat is obviously out of the bag ... I 've been thinking ... You should move to L.A. What am I going to do out here ? I mean ... I 'm barely surviving back home . I could use you . Oh , I don 't need any charity , alright ? Okay fine . I need you . I don 't know anything about effects , man . - That 's bullshit , come on . - That 's not bullshit . You 've got the eye and you know it . Alright , the computer is just a tool . I don 't know , OK ... I never saw myself out here . Where do you see yourself ? - You got five year plan I don 't know about ? - It 's not about the money , okay ? It 's always about the money . What about Elaine ? I can 't handle everything . You 've got to take care of that yourself . Terry , there 's a call for you upstairs . You think about it . Elaine . Alright , come on . We 're supposed to be having fun , what is the problem ? Just forget it , alright ? Look ... Terry sprung this whole California thing on me today , alright ? I had no idea ... I 'm late . What do you mean , late ? Late . Oh ! ... hey ! Since when ? I don 't know . I 've been feeling sick all week , so I took a test and ... Why didn 't you tell me ? I wanted to ... Believe me , I just ... I didn 't want to ruin your trip . You didn 't want ... Shit . Is that all you have to say ? What do you want me to say ? - I don 't think I 'm ready for this . - You 're not ready , Jarrod ? What about me ? - C 'mon ! - Hey , will you just ... Is that what we have to look forward too ? Elaine ... Hey , hey , we 've got ... we 've got ... We 've got a live one ! WE HAVE A WINNER ! Ah , yeah ! Go ! Go ! Go ! OH , MY GOD ! NO ! GOD ! NO ! Oh , my God ! Pardon me ma 'am , but We 've received a few noise complaints . From whom ? The building is half empty . I understand that ma 'am . The other half is trying to sleep . - So if you don 't mind if you just ... . - Fine . - Okay . Another one for the books . Ah , yeah . - Well ... well ... well - I call the couch . Oh ... c 'mon , plenty of room for both of us . - I like my space . - Whoa , alright . Beggars can 't be choosers . Good night . Earthquake ? Probably is just a tremor . Turn off the light . Ray ... What are you doing ? What is that ? Ray ! Stay here . - What 's wrong ? - He 's gone . Jarrod , no . Jarrod , no . Jarrod , Jarrod ... no . What the hell going on ? Terry , please try to help ! Jarrod , what 's with you , man ? Jarrod ? - Oh my God ! Jarrod ! Jarrod ! - Jarrod ! Please ... What 's happening ? - Jarrod ... - Oh God . Jarrod ... What 's wrong with him ? Jarrod , Oh my God ! - Where 's Ray ? Where 's Ray ? - No , no ... - Jarrod . - Where is he ? - He 's gone ! - What do you mean , " he 's gone " ? - I mean , he is gone ! - Did he fall ? - No ... - Did he jump ? - I don 't know .. I dunno ... Ray went outside ... to the light . And then ... then , he just disappeared . Terry , please ! Jarrod , look at me . What did you see , huh ? What you see ? Careful . Jarrod , what happened ? I don 't know . I was being pulled ... towards this light . ( Explosions in the distance ) Aye ! - Open the blinds . - No ... - Open the blinds . - No ! God ... ( Explosions continue ) There 's something down there . What ? Jarrod , check this out . I don 't see anything . - There are people on roof . - What are they doing ? I don 't know . We should check it out . You don 't know what 's out there . - It will be okay . - Alright . I 'm calling the police . - I 'll try to get some pictures . - You can 't go out there . I can 't let him go out there alone . It just keeps ringing . A gun ? Really ? Just check the news and find out what the hell is going on . - Terry .. - We 'll be right back . - Jarrod . - Look at me . Let 's go . Hurry back . The stairs is this way . ( Strange metallic sounds from above ) ( Dog barks ) Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! What 's going on ? I 'm going to check it out . What are you doing with the gun ? Get back in your apartment . Go ... And keep it ... DOWN ! Hey ... Are you sure about this ? There 's been nothing new since 4 am . Denise , check the TV . TV : " Buzz ... buzz ... buzz " It 's calm . Door : " SLAM ! " Damn it , Jarrod . You didn 't tell me to hold it open . I thought it was common sense . I 'm sorry . ( Explosion nearby ) Get down . What now ? Let 's get a better look . Phone : " Hi , this is Jackie . Please leave a message . " Mom , it 's me . Something happened and ... pick up . Please , just ... call me back as soon as you get this . ( Busy signal ) ( The sound of thunder begins ) Holy shit . " Click , click , click , ... ( continues ) " I can 't see it . Is that what I think it is ? Oh , my God ! - Just run . - What is it ? - Run ! - Go . Come on , pull ! Back up ! Back up ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! - Come on ! - Uuuggghhh ! Elaine , no ! Move ... move ! Honey , are you okay ? I feel like I am on fire . - She looked at the light ! - C 'mon baby , I 'm right here . Give me a Colpac ! ( Dialog distorted ) You looked too . How ? Oh , my God ! All those people . What do they want with them ? I 'm not looking to find out . God , I can 't believe this ... I mean how ? ... Once you look at the light . It grabs hold . It 's like ... It controls you . Who wouldn 't want to look at something so beautiful ? It is kinda brilliant actually . Enough of this shit . I 've got an idea . Where are you going ? - Walt 's . - What for ? - Terry ? - Don 't worry about it . - Terry ? - Everything is under control . Are you okay ? Yeah , fine . Let me see . I said it 's nothing . - Alright . - I ... Walt ? Yo ... Walt ? Walt ? Walt ? Are you in here ? Raf ! What the hell are you doing ? Hiding . I saw the people in the sky . Like the goddamn rapture ! Come on , we 're taking your car , and we 're getting the hell out of here . Let 's go .. I 'm not going out there ! Raf ! Raf ! Get down ! Raf ! Raf ! Raf ! Shh .. shut the dog up . Shh ... ! - Raf ! - No ... no ... no ... Walt ! Aarrgghh ! Walt ! Aaahh ! ... Aaah ! ... Aaah ! ( Gunfire in the distance ) Did you hear that ? Talk to me . We 're getting our belongings and getting out of here . What happened ? They took Walt . What do you mean they took Walt ? What are you talking about ? This one was different . They came into the the building and they just snatched him . Can we just go ? Hold on a second . Am I the only one who saw those photos ? That 's all happening right outside , right now . They 're everywhere Look , they 're not everywhere . They 're ... They 're not over the water . That 's right . Yeah , well it didn 't take them very long to find you on the roof . We can drive there in 2 minutes . You have no idea what they are capable of . Elaine , I know you are scared , OK . We are all scared ... But I am not burying my head in the sand , hoping it goes away . - I 'm not saying that . - Look , just take it easy man . - There 's nothing easy about this , man ! - I know it 's not . - They 're in the fucking building . Terry ? It 's the timer . My God . ( Alien approaching ) Go ! Go ! Go ! You 're disgusting ! What the hell is the matter with you ? - We will talk about that later . - Yeah , we will " talk about that " . Still want to stay ? I don 't want any of this . They didn 't see us , or hear us , so if we stay here and stay quiet .. For how long ? They are taking people out there , plain and simple . The further we get out of the city , the better off we are . He 's right . Jarrod . If we get to the boat we have a chance ! Yeah , but we don 't ... We have to ... We have to try ... Get your stuff , got food and water . Let 's do this . Elevator : " Beep ... Beep ... Beep ... Beep ... " Alright , come on . Look , the sooner I get there , the sooner the boat is ready to go . Ready . - Hey ! - Come on , let 's go . - What .. What are you doing ? Driving , I know the way ! You just take your slut . Candice ... Candice ! Get in the car ! Terry , I 'm so sorry . - Hurry up . - What do you think I 'm doing ? - Hey , slow down . - No . Just stop ! Do you need any help ? - No , go , we 're fine . - Yeah but , maybe ... Enough , alright ? I said , we 're fine . TERRY ! No ! Terry ! Terry ! Get up Terry , c 'mon ! Terry ! Terry ... Terry ! Oh God , Terry ! I 've got you ! Jarrod ! Get your ass back here now ! Drive ! Drive , now ! - Hey ! What are you doing ? - Get in the car ! C 'mon ! C 'mon ! - Open ... oh shit . - Come on . Open ! Open ! Fuck ! C 'mon ! Open , you piece of shit Back up ! Back up ! Back up ! Oh my God ! Help me . Help Me ! Help ! The keys ... the keys ! Give me the keys ! You alright ? Uh , hummm . Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - Miss you have to go .. - No . He 's alive ! Colin ! Help me ! Aaaarrrggghhh ! ... Aarrgghh ! Come on , let 's go ! - Go ! Go ! - Aaaahhh ! ( Alien screeches ) Make for the back door . Run ! Aaaahhhh ! Go ! Don 't stop ! Open the door ! - Get it open ! - Back off . - Open it ! C 'mon ! Where are we going ? All the way to the top is the safest place I can think of . Why should we go up there ? If you want to stay out here with that , you can be my guest . Come on , let 's go ! C 'mon ! Quickly ... quickly ... quickly ! I should have held on to him . Hey ! Come help me with this . It 's better than nothing , right ? Yeah , if you say so . What are you doing , huh ? Like it or not , this is happening . You 've got to be strong . Is everybody okay ? Are you hurt ? - No ... - I 'm okay . - What now ? - We stay here ... We keep watch , and we pray that someone comes . He 's right . Someone 's gonna come . It can 't go on forever . Right ? Sweety , it 's best if we stay together . I can 't . The smoke ... Given the circumstances , I think a smoke is more than reasonable . Candice ... I 'm pregnant , alright ! And I just thought that ... between all the stress ... It 's okay . I never even got to tell my mom . Come on , boss . Let the girls get some sleep . You and I will keep watching . Both of us ? They try that light stuff , we 've got each others back . I hate L.A. I haven 't seen a soul all night . Maybe the worst is over . Maybe not . What do you think these things really are ? I don 't know . Does it even matter ? It just doesn 't seems real . Well , it is real . You better wake up . What 's that supposed to mean ? The city is a vacant lot . We need to survive . There 's not going to be many of us left . ( Gunfire , explosions in distance ) What do you see ? Somebody is fighting back . What are you doing ? I want to see what 's out there . Turn that off , it 's too bright . - No ! - We can 't risk it . Did you sleep at all ? Is it getting worse ? - What ? - The marks on your skin ! I know when I looked in that light , I couldn 't stand for 10 minutes . Who knows what it did to us to our bodies . You remember the first moment when you saw it ? When it completely took over ? Somehow you ... you still felt powerful . I still do . Why don 't you take a seat , relax ? Alright , I 'll bite . What 's your plan boss , because I know you are dying to tell me . Nothing to say ? - We 're sitting on the marina for Chris-sake 's ... - I 've noticed that . There are hundreds of boats way across the street . We have been through all this . Remind us how that worked out last time . We 'll just go quietly this time . And search every boat till we find the key ? - We have to . - Great plan , Jarrod . I can 't believe you even suggest that after what happened . So , you think it was my fault ? I was practically begging , but you wouldn 't listen . And you think Terry would 've listen to me ? Alright ... Let 's say we make it out of the building . Across the marina , down the dock . We even find a boat and everything , then what ? - And then we get the hell out of Dodge . - Where to ? Carolina , down the coast ? - Anywhere will be better than here ! - How do you know ? We are here . We 're alive . ( A new sound ) What was that ? ( Sound continues ) What do you see ? ( Sound getting louder ) Hallelujah . Come on ... come on ... come on . Agh ! Everybody get down ! Laney ? They worked . - I don 't believe it . - Is it over ? It worked ! - Do you mind ? - By all means . Do you think they 're more planes where they came from ? Yes , now they know what to do . They 'll be sending help in no time . What ? What is it ? They 're not dead . They are just really , really , pissed off . Something is happening . We 've got to cover those windows . Come help me with this . Get back over here ! I 'll find something . Here . Jarrod , what are you doing ? Something you can 't do . What 's this really about , huh ? Those things are coming for us . You think I haven 't noticed that mess under your shirt ? We stay here and hold up ... for good . I agreed . I guess that decides everything . We have no water . - No power .. - Yes , but you saw what 's out there . Yeah ... and I 'd would rather make a run for it , then stay in a 20 story target . Between those things and the radiation , we are dead up here . ( Helicopter approaching ) Get down ! Move ! Move ! Go .. go .. go ... cover the fences . - Let go of me ! - What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - We have to let them know we 're here ! - We 'll let everything know ! We 've been saying we would go for help . The help is here . Does that look like a rescue chopper to you ? Don 't you get it ? We are at war . Where are they going ? Commander : " Get off the compound ! " Those choppers are coming back for them . We have to go . Come on . We 'll go the roof . They 'll pick us up . What if they don 't come back ? Look at what they did to those planes . What good is a helicopter ? - We have to take a chance . - A chance ? They just nuked the city , and you wanna wave hello ? Seriously , you need to back off . We have to .. Oh shit . You just going to stand there ? What happen when the rest of the block falls ? When we don 't even have a bed sheet ? - Come on . - How can you be so sure ? Let 's just go ! You 're in no condition to decide anything . Who knows what side you 're on . I 'm warning you . Stop it ! Both of you ! Look at his face . He 's sick . - Do not make me hurt you . - Oh , don 't worry . Uugh uugh ! I 'm not leaving here without my family . Cough ! And there 's nothing that you can do to stop us . Cough ... cough ! Elaine , you have to trust me . It 's me . It 's still ... me . I know . We have to go . He 's gonna get us killed . C 'mon . Come on . Alright , lets go . You see anything ? They 're right there . - Hey ! Help ! - Help us ! - Don 't move ! - Don 't shoot . - No , no , wait ! - Stay where we can see you ! - We need help , please . Go over there now ! Go .. go .. go No ! no ! no ! Nooo ... Come on .. Roger that . We will take defense . Inbound ! Hey ... hey ... hey ! Commander : " ... Jimmy 's on the way out . " Helicopter : " Copy that . I 've got a visual on the perimeter . I 'm going to land right now . " ( Alien screams ) C 'mon ! Noooo ! C 'mon ! Get off of me ! Get off ! Aaarrgh ! Hold still ! Aaarrrgghh ... aarrgghh ! Go ! Go ! Go ! The scaffolding ... That 's the only way down . Come on , go ! ( Alien screaming as he approaches ) Jarrod , come on , come on ! JARROD ! Ugh ... ugh ! - Jarrod ! - Laney , run ! Ugh ... ugh ! ( Alien slowly approaching ) Click ... click . ( Alien screams in agony ) ( Gunfire begins ) Commander : " Reload soldier . " Aaarrrggghhh ! Fuck ! Vaya con Dios , you son of a bitch ! CLICK ! Help me ! Help me ! Help me ... Oohh ! ... ugh ! Aaahhh ! ... Aahh ! Agh ! Agh ! Agh ! ... Aagghh ! Jarrod . Talk to me . Talk to me , Jarrod . Get up , come on . This is our only chance ! Elaine , please . You have to go . I 'm not going anywhere without you . Jarrod ! ( The sound of the baby 's heart beating ) My baby ! Aaaahhh ! ( Elaine screams ) ( Hear 's the baby 's heart beating ) Jarrod ...

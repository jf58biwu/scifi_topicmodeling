 My name is Alice . I worked for the Umbrella Corporation . The largest and most powerful commercial entity in the world . I was head of security at a secret high tech facility called the Hive . A giant underground laboratory developing experimental viral weaponry . There was an incident , the virus escaped . A lot of people died . Trouble was ... they didn 't stay dead . The computer that controlled the Hive was a state of the art artificial intelligence . The Red Queen . The Red Queen responded to the threat of the viral outbreak in an extreme way ... She went homicidal . You 're all going to die down here . The Red Queen attempted to kill everyone whether they were infected or not . I managed to escape but this was only the beginning . Viral outbreak spread like wildfire . First across the United States , then the world ... But the T virus didn 't just bring the dead back to life . It mutated them in terrifying ways . Despite The Apocalypse they had created , the Umbrella Corporation continued to experiment with the deadly virus . I was infected , but the virus bonded with me on the cellular level . I developed powers . Your genetic structure is the key . I became different . Powerful . Unstoppable . As I got stronger , the human race became weaker . I tried my best to lead what survivors I could find to safety , but we were pursued relentlessly . Even my friend Jill Valentine was seized and brainwashed by Umbrella . Shoot to kill . Finally I confronted the head of the Umbrella Corporation Albert Wesker . He robbed me of my powers but I still managed to defeat him . At last we thought it was over . We thought we had survived the horror . But we were wrong . Once again , We found ourselves fighting for our lives . Go , go , go ! Rise and shine , C 'mon babe we 're late . The alarm didn 't go off . Becky 's not up yet , Ms. Anderson is gonna be pissed . You know how they get when we drop her off late at the school . Babe ! ? You all right babe ? Yeah ... I 'll go get Becky . I charged your batteries for you . Becky ? You know Ms. Anderson , she wants you to speak while you sign . Thank you daddy . When you come back from school I have a surprise for you . I heard that . The way these batteries are lasting less and less , we 'll need to get some new ones . OK . Well , I can pick some up on my way home . I 'm going to be late , again . - Ah Shit ! - I 'll get you another shirt from the bedroom . Someone picked up your dry cleaning yesterday . You know you 're my little angel , don 't you ? - You 're going to be late remember ? - Oh. yeah I 'll get you that shirt . Get Becky back . No ! Help ! Help Us ! C 'mon ! Go ! Go ! No ! - Back ! - Wait ! - Wait ! - Stay back ! What the hell is wrong with you ? C 'mon , get in the car ! - What 's going on ? - Your guess is as good as mine . Why are these people doing this ? Those things are not people . Not anymore . Are you hurt ? Can you move ? OK . Oh shit ! Oh , shit ! Mommy . - Mommy C 'mon - Go ! I Love You Project Alice , why did you turn against Umbrella ? Jill , is that you ? Project Alice , why did you turn against Umbrella ? What happened to Chris and Claire ? Where are the others from the ship ? Project Alice , who do you work for ? Project Alice , who do you work for ? Jill , why are you doing this ? Warning ! Warning ! Unauthorized Computer Access ! Security System disabled , central computer reboot in 2 minutes .

Security System disabled , central computer reboot in 10 seconds . Central computer rebooting . Scramble all security teams and sweep the corridor with the laser grid . Standby . Standby . Tokyo sequence initialized Standby . Standby . Welcome to Umbrella central control . Oh yeah ! Don 't ! - My name is ... - Ada Wong . Operative for the Umbrella Corporation . One of Wesker 's top agents . I know exactly who and what you are . Now the real question is why don 't I just cancel your contract right now ? I don 't work for Umbrella anymore , and neither does Albert Wesker . I don 't care . You can kill her if you like , but then you 'll never get out of this place . - Now be a good girl . - Wesker ! Put down the knife . Oh , and Alice ? How nice to see you again . - How did she get out ? - She 's obviously getting help . We have a traitor in this facility . Security Systems were shut down for 2 minutes , ma 'am . - What about control ? - We still can 't raise them . I executed everyone in this control room , I enabled Wesker to hack the mainframe . We shut down the Security Systems , we let you out of that cell . We have to get you out of this facility . So why do you want to help me ? We need you , the human race faces extinction .. Our only hope for survival is for us to work together . I 'm not going anywhere until I know where we are and what the hell is going on here . You 're in the prime Umbrella testing facility . Explain Tokyo ? What you saw was just a detailed recreation , nothing more It goes on for a few city blocks , that 's all . - I was outside . - Were you ? - Saw the sky , did you ? - It was night . Stars ? The Moon ? The testing floor is 300 feet high , The ceiling black . It 's usually night in there , But isn 't that when the monsters come out anyway ? - It was raining . - Climate control , wind , rain , They can even make it snow if they want to . Why build such a place ? Simple , the Umbrella Corporation derived it 's primary income from the sale of viral weaponry . Something that 's impossible to test in the real world . They recreated the center of New York , simulated an outbreak , showed it to the Russians and sold them the virus . They simulated an outbreak in Moscow , and sold it to the Americans . - An outbreak in Tokyo . - Sold it to the Chinese . - An outbreak in China . - Sold it to the Japanese . Exactly ! Everyone had to have it . The Umbrella Corporation built a new arms race . Only this time it was biological rather than nuclear . Highly profitable , and this is where it all happened . This is Umbrella 's greatest creation . The belly of the beast . So why don 't we just get the hell out of here ? Stop ! Sun up is in less than 1 minute , why don 't you just see for yourself . This facility is located in the straits of Kamchatka , northern Russia . The old Soviet Union built submarine pens here in the 80s . After the Cold War ended , the Umbrella Corporation expanded them and built the testing floor . No one has ever escaped from this facility . - Ice ! - You 'll need all the help you can get . So I 've arranged for a strike team to enter from the surface and assist you . There they are , intake vents for the Umbrella facility . Looks abandoned . That 's what they want you to think . Let 's move ! We have just 2 hours to extract Alice and Ada . After that we can expect heavy Umbrella reinforcements . Running a bypass . These are the codes from Ada . - You trust her ? - Just enter the numbers . - The charges are set . - We 're in ! Let 's go do this . They 're in . The strike team has secured an elevator for your escape to the surface . They will eliminate Umbrella resistance , then rendezvous with us and escort us out . They have a friend of yours with them . - Luther West - He 's alive ? All right hold on ladies . Synchronize watches , 2 hours exactly in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... mark ! Leon , why don 't we just trigger the explosives remotely ? Can 't risk them jamming the signal . Whether we succeed or not this facility has to be destroyed . What if we take longer than 2 hours ? Well , then I hope you 're really good at holding your breath . Security Chief Valentine has reached the Tokyo test environment , she 's tracking you . They 're headed this way . Her orders are to recapture you if possible , terminate you if necessary . - Who 's giving these orders ? - The Red Queen . The computer ? Yes , the same artificial intelligence you encountered in the Hive . She now controls what remains of the Umbrella Corporation , she will stop at nothing to prevent you escaping to the surface . I 've plotted an escape route for you . You 'll cross the New York environment . To suburbia where you 'll rendezvous with the strike team . They 'll escort you through the Moscow environment to the submarine pens . And take the elevator back to the surface . The Red Queen has intercepted my signal , She 's about to regain control of the facility . You must hurry , I can 't ... Don 't listen to the traitor Wesker , I am in control now . Project Alice , Ada Wong stay where you are . - Let 's move . - Project Alice ... - You 're all going to die down here ! - I 've heard that before . Defensive formation . Lock your targets . Fire at will . Submarine pens are up ahead . Barry , you and I take point . We rendezvous with Alice and Ada in 30 minutes . Clear ! - Now that 's some hardware ! - Typhoon Class , Biggest nuclear subs the Soviets ever built . Umbrella used them to secretly transport Bio weapons all over the globe . Let 's pick up the pace. we have less than 90 minutes . Intruders detected . Targeted for termination . New York . We need to cross two more test environments to escape . - Let 's move ! - Why would Umbrella continue to run these tests ? They want to study the biohazard , learn how to control it . Initialize New York sequence , activate biohazard . Standby ! Standby ! New York sequence initialized ! The Red Queen ! She 's activating bio weapons to stop us . - Let 's go ! - Wait ! You hear that ? - You know what it is ? - I have no idea . You 've got to be kidding me ! Hey boys ... Bad idea ! Let 's move ! We 're behind schedule . - What 's going on ? - It 's the end of the sequence , they rarely last more than an hour . Come on ... before the Red Queen activates something else . Target survived . Security Chief Valentine to intercept . Intruders entering Moscow test environment , activate Los Plagos undead . What 's going on ? The Red Queen knows we 're here . Keep your eyes open . Standby ! Standby ! Moscow sequence initialized . - What ? - Listen ! Right there ! What the hell are those things ? Fall back ! Fall back ! - Clouds ? - They 're not real. it 's a holographic projection . When they were running a simulation , trust me , no one was looking at the sky . This is the rendezvous point . The strike team is late . Where are they ? Someone is in the house behind you ... upstairs window . Why would they be in here ? They 're using clones of me . - Of course ! You were one of the 50 basic models . - Basic Models ? How do you think Umbrella populates these test scenarios ? Hundreds of people dead each time they run a simulation .. Umbrella imprints them with basic memories ... just enough to ensure a correct emotional response to the threat of the biohazard . In one life she could be a suburban housewife , the next a businesswoman in New York , the next a soldier working for Umbrella . Mommy ! I hid like you told me . What happened to your clothes and your hair ? RPG ... down ! We 're running out of time .. - You have to find a way out now ! - Almost there ! - None of this is real . - It is to her . I know that 's the point . All these feelings she has for you , they were imprinted . A day ago she was a blank slate , I could show you a dozen just like her in cold storage . I 'm sorry , but it 's true . - Ready ! I was fast , wasn 't I ? - Yes , you were . - Daddy ? - He 's not your father . Capture if possible . Terminate if necessary . - There 's a child here . - Your problem , not ours . - All heart , you haven 't changed a bit . - I don 't know you lady . Now , surrender or die . Get down ! Advance in teams ! Yes , ma 'am ! You can 't stay here . This will show you the way out . Go through Moscow to the submarine pens . Take this . The less I have with me the better . Alpha team forward ! They 're coming . We have to hurry , Go ! I got it , this way ! Wait . She helped us . Don 't you remember ? You two made it ... I thought I was the only one that survived . What is this place and why is everything in Russian ? And what 's with the SM getup ? - You know how to use this ? - I campaigned for gun control . No . I don 't think you understand . I marched against the NRA . Concentrate ... it 's just like a camera . Point and shoot . Congratulations. you 're officially a bad ass ! What the hell 's going on here ? I 'll explain when I get back . Right now you have to keep her safe . - You stay with her . - You 're going ? You said you wouldn 't leave . Trust me , OK ? What I say is true ... I 'll come back for you . - You promise ? - Trust me . I love you . Come on , she 'll be back for you . Gotta find a hiding place . I met your sister . She 's not very nice . Let 's try hiding down here . - This way ! - Let 's move ! We can work our way around the ... Waiting for a written invitation ? - Sweet ride ! - Well , this is Moscow . I heard gunfire . Thought you might need some help . - Where 's Ada ? - I don 't think she made it . I 'm sorry . - You saw her die ? - No . She always has a plan . Boys ? You mind ? - Shall we ? - My pleasure . Let me know when you plan on doing that again . Heads up ! Our little friend is back ! Oh Shit ! - Almost there . - Wait , wait , wait , what are you going to do ? - Is everyone OK ? - Yeah . OK let 's go . Hello ? You can come out ! I 'm back ! Where 'd you find these guys ? - Who 's this ? - I 'm Becky . - Hi , Becky . - This is my Mom . - Your Mom ? Oh ! - Long story . 22 minutes left . There 's no going back the way we came . Yeah , and we lost our map with Sergei . I 'm on it ! We can take this tunnel . At the end , there 's a service shaft that leads down to the submarine pens . Let 's go ! How 'd you end up working for Wesker ? I don 't work for him . Things on the surface have changed . Wesker said you knew of some weapon . Something I could turn the tide for us . But I don 't think I would 've risked so much for one person . You 're probably right . This way ! The submarine pens are up above us . C 'mon move ! The elevator platforms are up ahead . - 11 minutes . - We 're gonna be OK . Hold on . 11 minutes , we 're gonna be OK . Hold on . Accessing power grid . Dispatching biohazard . Everybody get onboard ! Hold on ! Next stop menswear and sporting goods . Get down ! - Barry what is it ? - I don 't know . Where are you going ? Somebody must have cut the power remotely . Be strong . I 'm gonna keep you safe . - Can you get it back online ? - Not without the access codes . 9 minutes ... looks like we 're going with plan B. - What ? - There 's a reason we planted those explosives . No ! Mommy ! Mommy ! I feel like shit . She 's dead ! - What are you doing ? - She 's alive . I 'm going to get her . I didn 't lose this many friends . - So you could just walk away . - I plan on coming back . Don 't do this . You 're more important than she is . - That 's where you 're wrong . - This is a mistake . Get out of my way . Don 't leave without me , OK ? Are you kidding ? I 'm going with you . - Don 't move , don 't move . - It 's OK , go get her back . You like that , huh ? Move up ! Fall back to the elevator ! You go . I 'm gonna stay here awhile . - Barry ! - When the countdown gets to zero you have to be on that elevator . Someone 's got to stay . Besides , I 'm kind of enjoying myself . Go , go ! Come on ! Oh , Becky . Becky . Go ! Bring out the prisoner ! Cease your firing or I 'll execute her . Now , put down your guns and step out . Step out or she dies . Mommy , who are they ? Mommy , who are they ? Mommy , is that you ? - You 're my Mommy , aren 't you ? - I am now ! Move ! The choppers are on their way , so sit back and relax . What 's going on ? What the hell is that ? - Becky , are you hurt ? - No , I 'm OK . Told you she 'd have a plan . - Only the two of you ? - It 'll be enough . The Los Plagos parasite . Terminate Project Alice . Alice ! - You can 't kill me . - I don 't need to . - I 'm coming for you . - Good luck with that . Leon - What is it ? - It 's help . Glad to have you back I don 't care . Wesker , I see you 've made yourself at home . Well , I must say it does have a certain ease to it . What is this ? What have you done to me ? You were the only one to successfully bond with the T virus . To fully realize her powers , well , now I have need of you , the old you . So I 've given you back your gift ... you are the weapon . - I 'm gonna kill you . - Perhaps . But first you have work to do . The Red Queen is determined to destroy all life on earth . This is the last that remain of us , of the human race . It seems we 're bonded against a common foe . This is why we needed you back . The ultimate weapon . This is humanity 's last stand , the beginning of the end .

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - And an 0-8-4 is ... ? - An object of unknown origin . Sky is the 0-8-4 ? And who do you work for , Raina ? The Clairvoyant ? The Clairvoyant gives us guidance . - He has you building super soldiers . - Mike ... he 's a good guy . Mike ! No . Ian Quinn . You got to be kidding . This is Quinn 's M.O. He finds young talent and he takes advantage . We 're on to you . Well , thank you , Agent Coulson . And I have a message for you . The Clairvoyant told me to say hello . 1x13 - T.R.A.C.K.S. sync correction by f1nc0 web dl sync snarry - Ian Quinn . - You found him ? No , but we think we know how we can . Skye tracked down an invoice from one of his shell companies . He made a big purchase recently . - $ 10 million big . - Any idea what it is ? No clue , but it was designed and built by Cybertek , Inc . , a small firm that deals in advanced technology and research . Which is where this gets interesting . They 've hired a private-security outfit to transport the purchase ... former military , ex-mercs . Lot of muscle to move one package . And they know S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s got eyes on Quinn . Which is why they 're transporting it old-school . On a train , through the Italian countryside , from Verona to Zagreb ... very rural , very isolated . And you think Quinn 's on that train . No , but I believe they 're delivering the item to Quinn himself . We got our intel from Italian authorities who have been monitoring the situation . And they don 't mind us taking over the op ? I asked very nicely . You 're not asking me at all , Agent Coulson . You 're telling me and my team to step aside to hand over our investigation to S.H.I.E.L.D. Try to think of it less as a hand-over and more as a hand-off . You 've done your part . Now we 'll do ours . If everything goes as planned , Cybertek 's security team won 't even know we were on the train . - So we 're going in undercover . - I hate undercover . May and Ward , you 're front and center . Once we locate the package , you 'll tag it with a tracker . Skye and Fitz , you 'll be running communications . After the package is tagged , we 'll follow it to Quinn . Once we capture Quinn , we 'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant . And what about the two of us , sir ? - Here . Let me get that . - Oh . Thanks , Dad . Who looks far too young to have a daughter my age . Prego . - That looks cozy . - Once I 've located the package , I 'll let you know where to place the tracker . Seem like things are getting personal ? I 'm talking about our operations . Look , I know Coulson was put through hell , but ... he hasn 't been the same since . I don 't know what he said to Skye , but she 's different . - How so ? - Driven , focused . And she was holed up for days trying to track down Quinn . It feels like Coulson 's got her on a warpath . - Seems personal . - It is personal . The Clairvoyant had him tortured . Quinn 's the only person we know who 's connected to all this . We both know personal urges can adversely affect tactical decisions . That 's why I don 't have any . - You should do the same . - Really ? Coulson will take that excuse if he finds out about us ? Took it okay when I told him . - Wait . You told him ? - Yep . - Are you nervous ? - Just ready for this all to be over . - I 'm ready to get Quinn . - Me , too . So , are we British or American ? - Does that matter ? - Well , we 're traveling together . We should at least be from the same country . How 's your Scottish accent ? I don 't know . You tell me how great it is , laddie . American , then . - That 's a better idea . - Oh . That was really good . I used to watch a lot of American TV growing up . Some of it 's quite good . Lots of nice teeth . Oh . Here we go . Follow my lead . Excuse me ! - Do you speak English ? - Of course . How may I be of service ? Can you recommend a restaurant in downtown Zagreb ? Someplace affordable , with big portions . You are looking for something romantic ? Yes . Please . We are celebrating our six-month anniversary with a whirlwind trip all over Europe . - - Well , technically , we met six months ago , but he didn 't ask me out till last month , so our official one-month anniversary - isn 't until next Saturday . - Sunday ... Saturday . Yeah . I think he found me intimidating . Young love . So ... confusing . Is it ? You , got a little flustered back there . What ? When you kissed me on the cheek like my grandmother ? Good going . Really selling our relationship there . I have a device that could have done those things ... broken the lock and all that . What ? Why wouldn 't you tell me that ? I 'm always the gadget guy . Maybe sometimes I want to do things with my bare hands . You make the gadgets with your bare hands . Just allow me these rare moments of self-pity , okay ? You 're the least supportive pretend girlfriend I 've ever had . Comms are live . Coulson , Simmons , you in position ? Yes . Just waiting on May 's signal . So remember , our target is Carlo ... Mancini , the head of security . I know . I memorized his face . I memorized everything . - What are you doing ? - Oh . I 'm getting into character . My undercover persona harbors residual resentment to her absent American father ... Blames him for not being there when her mom died . So I apologize in advance if I come off a little cold . You think all that back story 's necessary ? Past events , like that unfortunate incident at the Hub , have shown me that I 'm not good at improvisation . However , I excel at preparation . He 's headed your way . You 're on . All mom ever wanted was your love , to be with you , at our two-story Victorian home in the Cotswolds ! But could you even give her a moment , what with your banking job requiring you to travel to the states from Tuesday to Saturday every other week ? ! No ! I 'm terribly sorry about your loss , dear . As for you , now is your chance to do better . - Why don 't you see that you take it ? - Thank you , sir . Let 's go . He 's right . You never had any time for her , but you made time for your work ! And your prostitutes ! - Oh ! - Oh ! - Oh , god ! Oh ! - Oh , no ! Mom ! Terribly sorry . Prostitutes ? Plural ? May , coming your way . Copy that . Following the target to the package . Great . We see what you see . All right , May , Cybertek cases are usually lined with tungsten polymer to prevent scanning . It should appear black on your infrared . Bingo ! Eyes on the package , fourth seat from the back . As we round the bend , the passengers on the North side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Look at that . I haven 't seen anything so beautiful since our family 's scuba-diving trip to the island of Koh Tao in Southeastern Thailand . Okay , Simmons , I appreciate all your preparation , but ... And you want to know which marine life we encountered ? Ward , are you in position ? My comms are down . Are yours working ? - Fitz ? Skye ? - Something 's wrong . Sit tight . I 'm gonna go make sure we don 't lose that package . - Ward ! - We 've been made ! Grenade ! Coulson , we got to jump ! As we round the bend , the passengers on the North side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? May , got the tracker . Headed to the dining car now to tag the package . May ? May ? Cybertek knew we were here . Anyone copy ? Damn it . We 've been made . Comms are down . Where 's Coulson ? He went to the dining car to find the package . You 've been hurt . Let me take a look . Not now . Go to the luggage car . Lock yourself in with Fitz and Skye . Don 't come out until I get you . I 'm gonna get Coulson . - Ward ! - We 've been made ! Grenade ! Coulson , we got to jump ! - The train ... it just ... - Yep . Vanished . Which , I might add ... not easy . I told Simmons I 'd come back for them . May 's there . They 'll be okay . No , she 's not . - Is your phone working ? - No . Cybertek must have taken out our electronics . Not a grenade , exactly . Might be some kind of cloaking mechanism . Maybe it created some kind of portal , jumped the train there ? Oh , let 's hope not . I can 't deal with Asgard today . Cybertek knew we were coming . - How ? - Could have been the Clairvoyant . We got to get back to the plane . Come on . Keys might be in it . It 's the country . People are very trusting in the country . It 's running . Yeah , it 's been hot-wired . - This is ... - Suspicious ? I was gonna say " fortuitous . " Let 's get out of here . Signore Russo , what happened ? Agent Coulson . Thank god . I 've been trying to reach you . Cybertek knew . They knew we were at the station . They knew we were on the train , too . Most of my team is unaccounted for . Most of my men are dead ! - Where are you now ? - On our plane . We 'll send you the coordinates . And , Russo , do you have any idea what happened to the train ? What do you mean ? It vanished , with our team still on it . Okay . We 'll look into that . I 'm on my way to you now . And maybe together , we can find some answers , yes ? - What now ? - I 'll call H.Q. You take this . We need to figure out what the hell happened to that train . Holotable ... on . Holotable ... activate . Okay ... Really ? S.H.I.E.L.D. pulled satellite images . - And ? - Train 's gone . They 're checking alternate routes . If it 's somewhere on Earth , we 'll find it . It 's ... pretty tricky , right ? I couldn 't even find the " on " button . Can you zoom in ? I ... I think Fitz-Simmons do something more like ... Damn . Let 's just upload the specs to H.Q. - Good idea . - Yeah . Oh . Sir ? This probably isn 't the best time , but what May told you ... I would have preferred it to stay between me and her . Well , " it " is happening on my bus , amongst members of my team . No , we 've never ... done ... It 's never happened on the bus , sir . You want to do this now ? Okay . What you 're doing is against protocol , so if you endanger an operation or if anyone gets hurt , I 'll reassign you to Barrow , Alaska , and you 'll spend the rest of your years pulling the night shift guarding Blonsky 's cryo-cell . Am I clear ? I 'll take that as a yes . And if it 's really just sex , Ward ... you should get more comfortable using the word . Agent Coulson , it 's gonna be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's ... Wheels up in five . As we round the bend , the passengers on the North side of the train can take in the views of the famous Tre cime di Lavaredo . Isn 't it a wonder ? Ward , you 're up . Ward ? Something 's wrong . Cybertek 's leaving the dining car . Ward , Coul ... Fitz ? Skye ? Can anyone read me ? I 've got to get you guys somewhere safe . We 've been looking for you , Agent May . Get your bearings , sweetheart . Get your bearings . There you go . There you go . I realize you 're confused . But I 'm here to help . You see , I make sure Cybertek products move across Italy without incident . They make sure I 'm well taken care of . And they 'll take care of you , too . All you have to do is tell me where Agent Coulson and Ward are . That 's it . Why are you smiling ? You called me " sweetheart . " Fine . Have it your way . Just remember , your boss asked to be part of this op . I warned him against it . So if you 're looking for someone to blame , look to him . That 's just what I needed . Russo ! If it 's really just sex , Ward ... you should get more comfortable using the word . Agent Coulson , it 's going to be all right . We found your people . The train , it 's ... - Wheels up in five . - You okay ? You were on the train when it disappeared . May , Russo was ... Explain yourself , please . The train didn 't disappear . Russo sold us out . Get the plane ready . I need a shower . You 're hurt . Let me stitch you up . I said get the plane ready ! Let me help . You know ... we have this stuff for a reason . S.H.I.E.L.D. found the train . Turns out it switched tracks shortly after we got off . That grenade must have released some kind of toxin . Made us believe no time had passed . I saw you guys frozen on the field . - You looked ridiculous . - It wasn 't supposed to be a combat op . They 'll be fine . They can handle themselves . I got it . Gently . Okay . - Thank you . - Did he get you anywhere else ? We need to reroute the plane . We just got word from S.H.I.E.L.D. that the train stopped suddenly in the Italian countryside . - What ? Why ? - We 'll find out soon . I 'll set the coordinates . Touchdown in 10 . - I 'll come help . - I got it . All right , grazie . Parked here 15 minutes ago . Agents on the ground have no idea why . - Any sign of Fitz-Simmons and Skye ? - No . Everyone get down ! Simmons , stop ! Wha ... ? Where are Fitz and Skye ? As we round the bend , the passengers on the North side of the train ... I wish we had more time to take in the scenery . ... can take in the views of the famous Tre cime di Lavaredo . Three peaks of Lavaredo ... supposed to be stunning . Any chance what 's in there could be an 0-8-4 ? This ? Now , we may not know what it is , but we do know that it came from Cybertek . Right . Unknown origin . And the one we found in Peru was a machine , but they don 't always have to be , right ? No . No , I 've read about all kinds ... weapons , spacecraft , energy sources . I suppose the only thing they really do have in common - is that they 're dangerous . - Right . Hey , whatever this package turns out to be , we 'll deal with it , like we always do . We 've faced worse and made it through . Fitz , have you ever heard of an 0-8-4 being a person ? No . Although I ... I suppose it 's possible . Hate to meet the guy . Whoa . May 's goggles are offline . When did that happen ? May , do you copy ? All comms and phones are dead . Someone 's using some sort of electronic scrambler . - Cybertek knows we 're here . - We have to warn our team . Fitz , get down ! We 've been made ! Oh , bloody hell . Jemma ! Oh , my god . She 's okay . Okay . Hold her up . There we go . I think this is some form of dendrotoxin . The same stuff that 's in the night-night gun ? Yeah . It 's clearly evolved . I think they made it airborne . Is that why their eyes are open ? I suppose if they were in some sort of black sleep , - that would make sense . - We got to get out of here , find the others and figure out what to do next . Yeah , but help me move Simmons first . Can 't just leave her like this . Look at her little face . She 'd be so embarrassed . We should leave her with something to protect herself , just in case . Yeah . Have a spare . What about him ? That 's for Simmons . Train 's stopped . I know . And I looked everywhere . - May , Ward , and Coulson are gone . - What about Cybertek ? They have the package , Fitz . What do we do ? We 're the only ones left . - Do you have an extra tracker ? - Of course . Then we follow them . Hey . Look . Coulson was right . Cybertek led us to Quinn . Activate the tracker . Let them know we 're here . - You want to go in ? - We can 't let Quinn get away again . If Coulson were here , he wouldn 't let that happen . He wouldn 't want us to let that happen . You 're right . - Let 's do it . - Can you disable their cars ? With my bare hands . Take this . - You 'll need it out here . - Just take it . Be careful , okay ? You , too . Okay . Find Mr. Quinn . Tell him his purchase is downstairs . Si . - Mike . - Hello . Skye . The Clairvoyant told me to expect you . Signor Quinn , this is the same gun as the specs you gave us . Yeah , you guys have been looking at us while we 've been looking at you . And we found a handful of particularly interesting things . Mike . Oh , god . You 're alive . That 's right . You two know each other . Hey . Do you know who I am ? And you have your orders . Good , because I purchased something that 's gonna help you complete them . Orders ? Mike . What is happening here ? Mike . Stand , please . Mancini , thank you . You will be receiving your payment shortly . That is the best money can buy , my friend . Every piece of technology in you is top-of-the-line . I just wonder if I 'm getting my money 's worth . I know you get your orders from the Clairvoyant , so that means you 're not allowed to hurt me , right ? No . What if I tried to hurt you ? Would you stop me ? No . I would not . Mike , listen . I do not know what they 're doing to you , but we have to get out of here . Now . And ... if I wanted you to ... to hurt her ... you know , kill ... will you ? I mean , what would hurt Agent Coulson more than to lose his pet project ? Those aren 't my orders . She 's not who I 'm supposed to kill . Wait . Wait . Wait ! What the hell did you do to him ? Shh , shh . I 'm sorry . I have my orders , too . Help ... - Where 's Quinn ? - Where is the money ? There is no money . You failed . It looks like it 's working to me . Apparently , there 's been a misunderstanding . We delivered the package as promised . If we can just speak to Mr. Quinn ... The Clairvoyant isn 't happy . - You led S.H.I.E.L.D. right to us . - Let her go . Skye . Where 's Skye ? S-s-she didn 't want to let Quinn get away . Help , help ... He ... Driver 's not answering . Coulson 's team finally got here . Where 's Skye ? You know , Agent Coulson , it 's dangerous ... to keep sending her in like that , all alone ... when she means so much to you . Search the house . Find her ! Now ! No . Oh , no . Oh , god . Simmons ! Get down here ! Oh ... Oh , god . Hang on . Just hang on , okay ? Oh , god . - She 's been shot . - Keep her upright . I got no pulse . She 's lost too much blood . I don 't ... - Put her in there . - Do you even know what this thing is ? It 's a hyperbaric chamber , and I said put her in there now ! - Now ! - Okay . - Come on ! Let 's go ! - Yeah . All right . All right , gentle . I need to get her temperature down . Fitz . - Temperature 's dropping . - Pressure stabilizing . Is it working ? For now . Her core temperature 's hovering around 44 degrees Fahrenheit . If we don 't bring her back up to temp in the next few hours , she could sustain permanent brain damage . We need to get her to a medical facility and fast . Until then , I 'll do everything I can to keep her alive . Excuse me . It 's not your fault . She never should have gone in there alone . Blaming yourself won 't help her . I 'm not blaming myself . Can I please see my son ? NOT YET . sync correction by f1nc0 web dl sync snarry

 Previously on Fringe : We have been looking for you and your friends . Who 's the little girl ? Who 's the little blond girl ? If you 're watching this then you know the Observers have invaded . I must have ambered it . I need a proper laser . Could you make one ? - Don 't you wear a necklace ? - We need the silver for soldering . Thank you . If you found this tape , you 've retrieved it from amber . - Got it . - You must recover each tape to retrieve all the parts of the plan . This plan can rid the world of the Observers . You are humanity 's only hope . Greetings . Looking to barter ? No , not tonight . " if you want to make God laugh , tell him your plan . " It 's been here a while . Guess it hits a little close to home . Yeah . Man . I had one of these when I was a kid . Me give you a good deal , man . Actually , what I 'm looking for is , uh- - This is what you are looking for . You must stop I said rock I said you rock it and you shock it And you , ooh , say so - Yep , that 's it . - It will look good on her . The young blond woman . - What is baseball ? - Excuse me ? You were thinking of the Red Sox . What is baseball ? It 's a sport . Or it was anyway . - How much ? - What do you want to give I for that ? I am upsetting you . You do not like to be read . Who 's upset ? I got nothing to hide . What 's to be upset about ? That take care of it ? Bloodclot , man . - I haven 't seen one in years . - You 're trying to confuse me . - I don 't know what you mean . - Who is the blond woman ? - You are protecting her . - Know what this is worth ? Yeah . Keep the change . - My papers . - What are you doing out so late ? We have our papers . This the only paperwork you have ? There is something wrong . Detain him . Freeze ! Stop right there ! Now ! He 's down there . The last time I went under , I got bit by a rat . He is a rat . Bite him back . Is that a real gun ? Where am I ? You came out of that storm drain . There . You 're bleeding . Come to mama . - How does this one look ? - A little less warped than the others . - Hopefully , it 'll play better . - It took hours . Walter , this is as fast as we can go without too much heat damage . Fast as a snail . At this rate , we will save the world in another 21 years . I 'm gonna clean this up . You know how old that would make me . I don 't even wanna do that math . - Peter , what happened ? - It 's all right . It 's superficial . I was trying to get gas . I got read by an Observer . Pulled thoughts out of my head like cards out of a deck . What did he get from you ? He did get an image of you . You 're as much a fugitive as us . Unless you can think of why that would hurt us ... Did he indicate that he pulled anything else ? No . I kept a bunch of random thoughts in my head . But he knew I was doing that too , so I just got out of there . These guys , they out-move us , they outthink us . They 're always two steps ahead . More if they focus . I don 't know how we 're gonna beat them . We beat them one by one . Instinctively , you did the right thing . You just have to create a labyrinth of planned thoughts . Keep them preoccupied . Yeah . Trying to block that reading was exhausting . I couldn 't do it . It 's impossible . It 's not impossible . I 've taught others . It just takes a really long time . - Well , teach me . - I plan on it . Teaching you all . In the meantime I want you to consider this a down payment on my first lesson . You gave up your necklace so we could work on the laser . I wanted to make sure you got a new one . Thank you . Worth every bump and bruise , kiddo . Well , you know the expression , " no good deed goes unpunished . " Living proof . You wanted to see me ? - You do not like to be read . - Who 's upset ? What 's there to be upset about ? I got nothing to hide . This is what he purchased . An alloy of gold and other metals , minerals , argentite and chlorargyrite . What is its purpose ? Its purpose ? You wear it . You put it around your neck . He is a fugitive . Why put oneself at risk in this quadrant for something so unexceptional ? These fugitives are confident enough to walk freely . I think they receive information . The resistance is protecting them . You mean , they 're being tipped off . To our movements , yes . Two days ago , one of the men in your division failed a security test . I believe he is with the resistance . I think you will be able to get information about the fugitives through him . Why didn 't you tell me about the security fail ? - I could ask you the same question . - I didn 't know about it . That is my point . I 'll look into it . Welcome to tape two of my plan to defeat the Observers . Before we begin , first and foremost ... you must accept the reversibility of all phenomena . - -Particles have their speeds reversed then the changes- - And found a measurable effect . Let me be crystal clear . - -Understanding of these scientific concepts , we will not be fighting in the same field . These are the plans that we must follow to the letter . - -Plans be retrieved . It 's impossible to tell what he 's saying . This is as clear as I can get it . I 've hidden them as I would my most prized possession . It 's a funny story , actually . When I was a boy , my mother would take me on what she called " Manhattan mystery tours . " Heh-heh . We 'd catch the first train that came to the station . We would venture into the city and get off at the- - Get off at the- - The tape is ripped . It got caught on a fleck of amber . I 've heard enough . I know where the tube is . - You do ? - Mm . The subway platform beneath Newark Penn Station , in the wall . - How do you know ? - Because as a boy my most prized possession was my collection of Detective Comics . And like everyone , I was terrified that the pinkos would attack . So I thought that a subway platform would be the safest place to hide them because it was underground . - I was 10 . - That 's where you hid the plans ? Yes . - Under Newark Penn Station ? I am sure of it . - Every major access point to Manhattan has an Observer checkpoint . That includes train stations . We have to take out the guards . - Are they Observers or Loyalists ? - Both . - Both . I don 't know if we can get close enough to take them out without being detected . We need a diversion . We 're gonna need a lot more than a diversion . Peter . I 'm going to want to get to that rolling cabinet in the amber . Walter , there 's nothing in there except lab equipment and your Easy-Bake Oven . I 'm not after what 's in it . It 's what 's under it . Astrif , prepare the laser . Walter , why won 't you tell us what 's down there ? Because I 'm not sure that what 's down there is worth talking about . I 'm not sure what 's left . Here , use some of this . All of you . It 's Mentholatum . Not as bad as I thought . Walter , is this what I think this is ? My cold storage of all the Fringe events we ever encountered . Dormant for 21 years . If we 're going to find a diversion to get into the station , we 'll find it here . What do you suggest , Walter ? There was a time when we solved Fringe cases . Now I think it 's time we created a few of our own . So this is every Fringe event ? Documented and preserved to the best of my ability . Oh , look , Olivia , my porcupine man . You really had no idea that he was doing any of this ? I wouldn 't have slept at night if I did . Some secrets are meant to be kept . For two reasons . Number one , because they 're mine . And number two : I have a healthy distrust of the government . These items were safer with me . Ah ! Put that down , you 'll amber us . It 's an ambering device . Put it down gently . Hair trigger , if I recall correctly . There 's gotta be a better option to get into the train station than a portal that lets us see into another universe . I suppose you 're right . Oh . I 'll have to go through all this to see what 's still viable . The answer is here somewhere . Oh , my goodness . What is it ? It 's my old doughnut hole . Jelly . It 's still spongy . It 's still good . Why am I still here ? Two days ago , you failed a security test . That 's why you 're nervous . - You are a recent graduate of the academy ? - Yes . And your date of induction ? - April 25th , 2033 . Were your parents proud to see you in uniform for the first time ? My parents are deceased . Did you think of them during the ceremony ? I missed them being there , if that 's what you mean . What was the weather like ? What ? That important day . The weather ? It was sunny . On April 25th , 2033 , in Boston rainfall began approximately at 10 : 20 a.m and continued steadily until late in the evening . - You were never at the academy . - No , you 're mistaken . I was Class 58693 Tech Alpha . You are a member of the resistance . Someone forged your paperwork to be installed in your position . You cannot conceal it . I can see it right there . What do you know about the fugitives ? Where is Peter Bishop ? Where did he go ? Where are the fugitives hiding ? You overheard Anil say something ? What did you hear Anil say ? Forget about him for a second . I saw something else that interests me . The Dove . Who is the Dove ? Hm ? What is his real name ? I don 't know . Nobody does . - What did you discover ? - He is a low-level operative . His information is limited . I found bits and pieces , but not everything . We 've heard the name " the Dove " three times now . What else ? When I said the name Peter Bishop he recalled a moment when he overheard Anil mention a lab in Sector B. I think you know this as the old Harvard University ? I thought you would recognize it . You had a relationship with these fugitives that I thought we would call upon . How did you know that ? That I had a relationship ? Captain Windmark told me . He said he was going to ask you about it . He did not ? I knew them , but that was a long time ago . According to this man 's knowledge , they are in the lab . I will make my report . Pull ! Walter . Technically , this is a weapon of mass destruction . So is a mosquito that carries the West Nile . This will do beautifully . Perfect delivery system . It looks like there are more Loyalists . What was the count before ? Three ? Four ? Yeah , now it 's seven . It 's not going to be easy getting into this subway station . Where 'd you get that ? I found it . At our old house on Quincy Street . I wanted to remember things . I don 't know . I just wanted to be there . It made me feel closer to you . It was looted . The entire block was . Upstairs in your bedroom , what used to be your bedroom I found what was left of your old jewelry box . There was this matchbox inside . I shook it and found this . I figured it had to be important or you wouldn 't have kept it . How long have you been wearing it ? Since I was 13 . You want it back ? No , no . No , I want you to keep it . Let me see it . You know , your father used to call this " the bullet that saved the world . " The lab 's been compromised . Peter . - What 's wrong ? We need to go now . - Well , we 're ready . No . The Observers know that we 're in the lab . How ? Who told you that ? Somebody I trust . - We don 't have time . - We cannot leave the lab . Without the tapes , we have nothing . Forget the blueprints , forget the rocks from the mine , forget what 's in the tube . None of it means anything without the plan . There goes the world . World ending . We 'll never be able to set foot in the lab again . I have an idea . Walter , we need to re-amber the lab . There 's nothing here . It 's just an ambered lab . Control , building is secure . 1-6 heading back down . Copy that . Confirm return to base . No one has been in that lab . The reading from the prisoner was deceptive . Well , how is that possible ? Somehow she hid her thoughts from us . Deceived our readings . Perhaps others can as well . Hi . Perhaps you can help me . I 'm trying to get to Kennebunkport , Maine . - Let me see your travel authorization . - Of course . Thing is , I 've been driving around in circles . I was hoping you might help me with directions . - I will handle this . - The thing is , I 'm a bit lost . - You electrocuted me . - Your authorization . Now . Of course . Here we are . - They 're gonna meet us around back . - Here we go . - -commuter express to Philadelphia Union Station now boarding on Platform 6 . All right , Walter . You 're up . Where is it ? There . " Kilroy " ? I drew that . It must be in the vent . There 's a line . It 's got something heavy . It 's the tube . Let 's go . Peter . There ! I 'm in . Go , go , go ! What 's written on it , Walter ? It 's some kind of physics . It 's beyond anything I 've ever seen . - I don 't understand . - Well , Walter , it 's your handwriting . So even if it was wiped from your mind , you must have understood it at some point . Perhaps it was dictated to me . By September ? You think he gave you these equations ? - I don 't know . - Do you think you 'll be able to figure it out ? Don 't you understand ? This is Greek to me . Except that I read Greek . This is Aramaic to me . Not the western dialect . I do speak a little . Walter . - I don 't know what this is . - I 'm sorry . - Okay . - Well , we should get back to the lab . - Not yet . Somebody wants to see you . Agent Dunham . Phillip . It 's good to see you , Dr. Bishop . Peter . - I asked her not to tell you in case- - - We were read . When I heard that you were back , I tried not to , but I had to see you . Five years ago , I got called to a crime scene outside the city . I saw Etta for the first time . And even though she was turned away from me I could have sworn I was looking at you . It wasn 't until I told her who I was that she admitted the truth that she was your daughter . Once I knew , I had her transferred into my section . I had a mind I was gonna look after her but she taught me . She recruited me in the resistance . Taught me how to block them from reading my thoughts . - How long did that take ? - Nearly a year . They used an airborne toxin . It hyperactivates a protein that generates scar tissue . Barbaric . What was their purpose here ? They took something that was hidden inside . What , we don 't know . - Captain Windmark . - Yes ? One of our men died holding this . I think we 're gonna be able to find them . HK pistols with rechargeable power cells . Pulse rifles , motion sensors , scent cones . - Antimatter batons ? - Fourth gen , delayed fuse . Blast radius of 100 meters . And once it 's armed , it can 't be deactivated . - When you use it , don 't stick around . - How did you get this stuff ? It wasn 't simple . Tell Anil he owes me . Seeing you makes me realize how much I miss Boston . Maybe I 'll put in for a transfer . It 's all right . I 've apprehended them . - They found you . - How ' ? They put a tracker on us . That Loyalist , before we drove off . You can 't let them find you here . - You won 't make it by car . Run . Protect the plan . At all costs . Peter ! Go ! - Get out of here ! We can 't stay here . The far end . Down there . There . They know we 're in here . Cover every entrance . Walter , run . I 'll cover you . - Cover me . - We 've gotta go back for them . We will . We 're gonna double back . Ready ? Go . Walter ? - Go , go . - On your six . - Main entrance , clear . - Move , move . Walter ? Peter ? He bought the necklace for you . For what purpose ? I would like to know . Love . You never know when to give up . Etta . Etta . No , no , no . Oh , Etta . Look at me , okay ? You 're going to be okay . - Etta ? - But we have to move you , okay ? No . There 's no point . Oh , no . We 're not gonna leave you here . You have to . You won 't make it with me . I 'll slow you down . You have to leave . Etta . I love you so much . I know . No . No , no . I can 't . No , I can 't leave you here . Not again . No . - No . - Son , we have to go . We 're sweeping buildings two and three , but there 's no sign of them . Love . They would go back for her . You were wrong . The necklace . We need to leave . She 's gone , son . We have to go . She 's gone , son .

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Rebecca St. Clair ? You found Jack . You weren 't just his girlfriend . You 're a Warehouse Agent . I always knew if we didn 't quit , one of us , one day , would lose the other . One last thing that you might be interested in seeing . Together ... Forever . I guess Jack chose you over the Warehouse , after all . It says that the debronze function was activated twice . Who 's our mystery guest ? Pete , Artie says that H.G. Wells is actually- - a woman . I was apprenticed at Warehouse 12 . My daughter Christina had been murdered . Everything that ever mattered in my life is gone now . Except the Warehouse . I want to come back and work there again . She is nothing like me ! I 'll never trust that woman . H.G. Wells is to be fully reinstated as a Warehouse Agent . What are you doing here ? No . Oh ! No ! Do I make you nervous , darling ? No . Naw . Nervous ? Why would you make me nervous ? You 're part of the team now and ... Not evil . Artie ! Good . M-morning . Good morning , Artie . Why is no one here ? I 'm here . Congratulations . I 'll have a gold star delivered to your room . Where are the others ? Right here . Hey , guys . Claud , did you drop something ? Uh , yeah , I just had a little slippery fingers . I make her nervous . Claud , there 's no need for you to be nervous . I 'm not . I wasn 't . Jeez . It 's okay--there will be a period of adjustment . Although , I have already earned a gold star . Let 's talk about your next assignment . Shouldn 't there be some orientation for H.G. ? It 's not necessary . Let 's not make a fuss . Well , yeah , you already got a gold star . There is no gold star ! There won 't be orientation . It 's bad enough she 's here--at all ! Can we just try to get through this ? Well , now I 'm nervous . Why do things have to change , because of her ? Excuse me . Rebecca ? Are you kids still in the artifact finding business ? Jonah Ross , 82 . Local English teacher . Died of natural causes . A friend of yours ? Hardly . Jonah Ross was actually Jonah Raitt . In 1961 , he was an editor of Where When magazine . He killed three of his secretaries . And his wife . He used an artifact that altered their body chemistry- - skin , bone , muscle , blood . Turned them all to glass . Jack and I never found him or the artifact . Two of the women died before we got on the glass girl case . We could have saved Raitt 's wife and Roxanne Crane , but Jonah did something to us . We had no memory the entire day they were killed . Then he disappeared . All those years , Raitt and I were living in the same city . I went to his address to I.D. and retrieve the artifact , but- - But you didn 't find anything . He wrote this obituary himself . Read the last line . " If you 're still out there , Jack and Rebecca , thanks for my life " ? You think he was taunting you ? He was a cruel son of a bitch . The artifact is still out there a in play . No one else should die because I couldn 't crack down on this . We need to find it . All right , I 'll go to St. Louis . I 'll check out the house again . Claudia , forward me the info . I n use the field time . Uh , Artie , you don 't want us to go ? No , I got this . It 's getting a little crowded around here . Artie , I 'd like to come with you . Fine . We 'll find him . You say you ... Both blacked out . Apparently , Jack and I went about our lives . We just couldn 't remember it . We assumed that Jonah caused it . Was it 24 hours exactly ? No . It was 22 hours and 19 minutes . I 'm very observant . Why ? I don 't care if it is the H.G. Wells section . What the hell are we doin ' down here ? Why does it matter that it was 22 hours and 19 minutes ? What does it mean ? It means someone used my time machine . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x10 ♪ Where and When Original Air Date on September 7 , 2010 It 's not a vehicle like in my novel . Physical time travel is an impossibility . Okay , so ... It 's not a time machine . It 's a temporal consciousness transfer engine- - a means to traverse the space / time continuum using one 's mind . So it is a time machine . Not exactly . I 'd become intrigued by the idea of Gestalt , the collective unconscious . What if one were able to connect with the mind of someone who lived centuries ago ? It happens randomly in nature . Past life experience . Oh , right , right . Like Russell Crowe was a Tasmanian convict in the 1800s . I read it online . My machine allows your mind to inhabit the body of someone in the past , see what they see , feel what they feel . Live a day in history . And you 've done it . You 've actually traveled through time ? God , that must have been so awesome . No , not really . Okay , so what about the person , you know , possessed ? They black out . For 22 hours and 19 minutes . That 's how long the trip lasts . Never could work out why . Are you saying that someone used or will use this machine to inhabit Jack and me in 1961 ? That would explain your losing time . Hey , this doesn 't look like it belongs here . Might wanna take a look at this . " Dear Charlie , do me a favor " and put this in the H.G. Wells storage area . " I won 't ask about it . Don 't bring it up . Trust me . Jack . " That 's not Jack 's handwriting . I know . It 's mine . Hey , I-I 'm ready . Yeah , uh , listen , you don 't really have to tag along . I know . I just thought it would be nice if we could spend some time together . Maybe after we find the artifact , go for dinner and a movie . Really ? No ! Is this really how it 's gonna be ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You can 't keep freezing me out because I supported Helena joining the Warehouse . Oh , it 's Helena , now , is it ? If it 's all right with you , I 'll just keep calling her the villain . Artie , you 're being childish . Do you know what it takes to keep a Warehouse Agent alive , Myka ? Trusting the Agent beside you has your back . I couldn 't trust MacPherson , could I--could I ? He 's the one who let H.G. out . How the hell am I supposed to trust her ? Helena has proven more than once that she has my back . I thought I 'd proven that I had yours . You know what , on second thought , I 'll just handle this one on my own . So ... Artie decided to check out Raitt 's apartment on ... His own . What ? I know this is gonna sound nuts . I 'm sure you 're sitting there , arms folded , twirling your hair , biting your lip , not wanting to believe this , but ... I 'm you . I 'm Myka . Inside Rebecca . Well , your mind , anyway . We traveled back through time . I 'm Pete . Hi , Pete ! Hi , me . I can 't believe this ... This--this isn 't possible . We don 't have a lot of time . Can you be serious ? Don 't give Rebecca back her body all tensed up like that . Pete . Focus . Yoink ! It is you guys . Listen , Myka . Pete is gonna try to convince you to use the time machine to travel back to 1961 to identify an artifact . It 's okay--Pete 's actually right for a change . And Pete . Get your ass to mars . Get your ass to Mars ! Like Total Recall ! Oh , I love that ! Okay , we 're done . There 's one last thing you need to know before you get here . The artifact is- - Ohh ... Hey , are you okay ? It 's just seeing Jack again . Um ... Well , what about the butterfly effect ? You know , when you step on a butterfly in the past , it changes the whole future . No . I tried to change the past . I failed . Look , it 'll be strictly recon , right ? We 'll go back , get eyes on the artifact , and track it in the here and now . Maybe we should wait for Artie . Every moment you wait , it risks another person 's life in the present . Well , I did tell me to do it . Oh , sweet . Pete and Myka 's excellent adventure ! It 's funny . It was after this case that Jack and I fell in love . It was the day we blacked out . I woke up in an orchard , and Jack was kissing me . Our first kiss . I was so surprised . I mean , I always fancied him , but he was always so mean to me . All right . I hooked up the machine to the main power grid . That 's definitely enough juice for it to run the full day . Whoa , wait , whoa , whoa , whoa . Out of curiosity , what happens to us if Jack and Rebecca bite it while we 're inside their bodies ? Hoping not . I , uh , suspect your minds will be lost ... Forever . Hoping not ! Oh , good . Just making sure it 's as bad as I thought . I couldn 't change the past , but maybe you can . So is there a big countdown ? Uh ... No . The time machine set us on fire ! The time machine set us on fire ! Eew . Pete ! Pete , it 's okay . It 's okay . Look . ♪ ♪ Heh ! We 're in 1961 . Uh-huh . Myka . Check it out . We 're ... Jack and Rebecca . I was gonna say still hot , but , yes , that , too . My God . Are we done fixing our hair and makeup , ladies ? Who 's the old goat ? Charlie Martin . He 's their Artie . You think this is a good place to catch 40 winks ? Uh ... No , sir . No , uh ... Y-you 're right , Charlie . It 's not her fault . You see , I-I had kind of a thing there and ... Don 't blame him , really . It 's a rough morning for both of us . Sorry , Rebecca . Rough morning . Maybe you should take the rest of the day off . Or maybe you should get back to work ? We 're very sorry , Mr. Martin , sir . We 'll just get back to work . Yes . We 're sorry . Sir . Thank you . Sir ? Mr. Martin . What is this ? What 's goin ' on ? You two don 't cover for each other . You 're mean to each other . What gives ? Uh ... Y-yes . Right ! The meanness ... Jerk ! We have for each other ... Hate ... You . I need you in Calcutta . You 're off the glass girl case . Wait a minute , what ? What ? What do you mean ? Not a discussion . Gus is getting close to Man Ray 's camera . I need you on that . Another glass girl turns up , we 'll get back into it . Look ... This comes directly from Mrs. Frederic , so if you wanna piss her off and have her give you that stare , go ahead . Lady terrifies me . Look , Charlie , all we need is one more day . I 've already got a job lined up at the magazine , and Jack is going to talk to Raitt 's wife . I am ? Yes . It was in Rebecca 's my ... My file . If we don 't find anything , then ... Calcutta . Fine . 24 hours . No more . Oh , Charlie , we 're gonna need everything that you can find on Jonah Raitt . Of course , Rebecca . Anything you need . After all , I 'm your secretary , right ? I really don 't like him . He 's a bit of a sphincter . I 'm gonna go interview Raitt 's wife . I 'll meet you back here at the magazine , okay ? Un ... Believable . I know . Steaks for a dollar ! No , no . I mean the- - no , no , no , I know what you mean , but ... A dollar ! What--hey , hey- - what ? I want you to be careful in there , okay ? If he 's got an artifact in his office , just get eyes on it . Don 't engage . He 's obviously a nut bar . I 'll be fine . When you talk to Raitt 's wife , just remember it 's 1961 , okay ? Women slap men when they get fresh . Huh ? What ? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I am a capable ... Woman . You are just ... A tape recorder ! No . No . No , no , no , no , no ! First day ? Yeah . Roxanne . Thank you for your time , Mrs. Raitt . The Secret Service ! That must be so exciting . Well ... It has its moments . Well , if the President 's coming , it 's a good thing you 're making sure the neighborhood is safe . It 's just a precaution . Isn 't that true ? You know , we voted for him . There was something about that Nixon I just didn 't trust . Good call . Uh ... So ... Is there anything new around here , something your husband may have brought home from the ... Office ? He killed his three secretaries . And his wife . Are you all right ? I mean ... Yes , ma 'am . The four women were murdered cruelly in an unnatural way . I just , uh , had a feeling . You look so happy in that photo . Agent Secord , does the President have reason to be concerned about my marriage ? No . No , ma 'am . No reason . Mm . Thank you so much . You know , I really like your bracelet . Thanks . It was a gift . From who ? Was there someone that you 're , you know- - ladies . This is a place of business . Not a sewing circle . Certainly , Mr. Raitt . How can you tell if ... Oh , uh ... Ahem . It , uh ... Uses a--a lot of power . But don 't worry . The Warehouse can take it . It 's not the Warehouse I 'm worried about . I hate this . When I was talking to Beth , I kept thinking , " you have no idea that you 're gonna die today . " Today ! I mean , how is that fair ? It 's not . Rebecca . You seem to have gotten the hang of that dictation . You 're practically a natural . Oh , no , not really . I 'm going to be leaving for the day . Good night , Roxanne . I 'll see you in the morning . Yes . In the morning . Have a good night , Mr. Raitt . Well , I should probably ... Call it a night . Good night . She 's lying . They both are . They 're obviously meeting up tonight . Do people not know how to lie in 1961 ? That 's the Roxanne , the next victim . We can 't think of her like that . How can we not ? That guy is gonna kill her and his wife . There 's nothing that we can do . Recon only the timeline . Screw the timeline , okay ? I 'm going after Raitt . You stay here and search his office . Maybe he stashed the artifact . Pete , no , you can 't- - sweetheart , I am gonna need these collated and filed by the end of business today . Thanks , honey . Honey ? Sweetheart ? Listen , bub , I- - Pete ? There . That oughta be enough to stabilize it , at least until the fluctuations- - Claudia ... What 's this ? Artie ! Hey . What are you doin ' here ?

'Course , if you ask me , they could stand to spice things up a little bit . Add a little cheesecake . Maybe have a Swimsuit Issue . Got an eye for the ladies , huh ? I do . You know , they say that God made us in his image . It makes me think that God must be a woman . I mean , look at her . She 's stunning , right ? But this magazine , it does its best to make her seem dull . She should be admired like a work of art . Go back to Pete and Myka . Are you sure you 're okay ? I 'm fine , I 'm fine . No more sniffing ' glue , young Lady . Uh , Rebecca , I 'm sorry . Don 't be sorry . Just a little bit ... Too much excitement for this old gal . It 's very ungentlemanly to rifle through a Lady 's handbag . Well , when you collapsed , I wanted to check to see if you were taking any medication , and I had to look up , uh ... Erlopa . Erlotinib . You know , in a way , I 'm lucky . Most Warehouse agents don 't usually live long enough to die of cancer . What kind of a ... Prognosis ... Grim . And that 's optimistic .

Hello . What are you doing here ? This is a gentleman 's only club . Well , interestingly enough , if you 're wearing one of these outfits , nobody bothers to look at your face . Look , don 't try and talk me out of this , okay ? Raitt 's our guy . He 's been talking about turning women into art . Pete- - oh , great . He 's gone . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Do you know where Jonah Raitt went ? I 'm sorry , sir . He just drove off . Damn it ! Good work , Myka . Forget trying to stop him . How are we supposed to I.D. the artifact now ? Gimme the Farnsworth . So nice of both of you to check in . I 'm touched . You need to quit smokin ' , man . Charlie , did you get any of that information on Raitt I asked you for ? It was the highlight of my day . Well , were there any hotel receipts ? What ? Hotel ? Oh , right ! 'Cause if the dude 's stepping out on his wife , then- - he 's not inviting them home . Wrong again , Rebecca . He is inviting them home . Wait--come again ? Raitt took a deduction last year on a second residence , a one-bedroom at 15 Hoover Street . Must be a side pad where he engages in sexual congress with his secretaries . And Rebecca ... Nice catch . You 're teacher 's pet in every decade , aren 't ya ? The file said that Roxanne was killed on Hoover Street . Let 's go . She 's gonna be fine , Claudia . I assure you . So where 'd you go when you used your time machine ? Uh ... Mani-pedis with Cleopatra ? Snog with Casanova ? Paris , 1899 . Why ? That 's , um ... That 's where I 'd arranged for my daughter Christina to spend the summer with cousins . I was away a great deal . Single working mother , to use today 's parlance . One day , Christina awoke with a fever . Sophie , the housekeeper , had her stay in bed . The men who came to rob my cousins ' home were expecting an empty house . Sophie tried to fight them , but there were too many . She survived , but , um , Christina ... Sophie had no recollection of the 22 hours and 19 minutes during which the incident occurred . And when one of the thieves was finally captured , he described how Sophie had fought ... Using Kempo , a fighting style that I favored . And I began to suspect- - I-I knew , I just knew that somehow I had traveled back in time and become Sophie . Eventually , I constructed the machine , determined to alter the course of events . But the ink with which are lives are inscribed is indelible . I imagine ... Losing a child is the worst pain a person can go through . No , actually . When I tracked them down , what I did to the men who killed my daughter ... That 's the most pain a person can go through . Roxanne ! Oh ! Jeepers ! You scared the life out of me ! Roxanne , you 're in danger . Danger . Ha . Rebecca , what are you doing here ? We know what 's going on between you and Raitt . I have to go . No , listen to me ! Pete , Pete , look at me . Just don 't do this . I 'm not gonna let her die , Myka . Pete ! You know you can 't stop this . Roxanne , wait ! What are you doing here ? No ! Oh ! No ! I know you . You were at the club . What are you , following me ? My God . That 's Roxanne 's bracelet . What happened ? We can 't explain this , but ... She 's dead . We 're sorry . It 's not him . Raitt 's not our guy . And we don 't have much time to find out who is . All right , the first thing that we need to do is reanalyze the data . Ha . This place still does that , huh ? Yeah ... Artie ... What are you doing ? There 's a power clot in one of the secure storage sectors . It 's probably nothing . I 'll flush it out , send down a micro-pulse . Artie , no ! Oh ! Connection 's holding , but something just completely burnt out the reintegration wiring . Which means what ? I can 't bring them back . When Jack and Rebecca awaken , Pete and Myka will be lost forever . The power level 's dropping . Well , it 's overheating ! We--we need something to cool it down . On it ! Whatever you 're doing to my people , it stops now . Ah ! Myka . Myka , you okay ? Oh , God . What the hell was that ? I don 't know . D-do you think something went wrong ? Oh , Roxanne ... What did this ? Look , Raitt ... You need to tell us what you know . Who would want to hurt them ? I don 't know , I don 't know if something like this- - what do you mean , them ? Meredith and Ruth , the two other women who worked for your company . No , I-I got a note from them . They 're in Los Angeles for research . They never left that note . S-so this ... This happened to them too . Look , I know this is a shock , but you were sleeping with these women . Now , who would want to hurt them ? I wasn 't sleeping with them ! I was trying to take over the magazine ! I was trying to get rid of the publisher and take control of Where When myself . It needs artistic vision and independent thinking . So they were ... Helping you ? Yeah . They 're completely undervalued by that company ... And capable of so much more . You think someone found out , was trying to stop us ? No , no , but we need to get to Beth . We think she might be next . My wife ? Well , she has nothing to do with this . How do you even know that ? I can 't tell you . But just trust me . We 've got to get there now ! If they touch my wife , I swear to God ... Artie . What are you doing ? She 's killing them . I tried to explain that this is a form of time travel ! Time travel 's a physical impossibility . No , we know . This works on your mind . So does she . Archie pulsed the system . That 's what burned out the wiring . I wouldn 't have pulsed the system if I knew what you were doing . If we 'd have asked , you 'd have said no ! You bet your ass I would have said no ! Claudia , this is not your fault . You see the best in people- - people like her take advantage of people like you . I 'm not quite so naive . Am I naive ? I asked them to do this . If you 're gonna shoot the one responsible , fire away . I-I-f we don 't fix this ... We 'll lose them . They 'll die . Stand over me . Watch my every move . But let me save them . And if they die ... I won 't bother rebronzing you . What do you need ? I need a power source . Quickly . Beth ? Beth , are you here ? Look , don 't worry . We 'll find her . Pete--I mean ... I mean Jack is looking outside . If she 's not here , that 's good , right ? Why is that good , Jonah ? Oh , my God . My God , you 're all right . We were so worried about you . You shouldn 't be . I tried to make it so you 'd never have to worry , ever , and we 'd always be okay . Listen , Beth , there 's a terrible thing that 's happened . Meredith , Ruth , and Roxanne have been killed . Hmm . So ... You went right out and got yourself another whore . What ? I took care of the others . And you just bring another one around ? You killed those women . I 'd hope you 'd get the message . Maybe I should have been more obvious . Jonah ! Look , Beth , there 's gotta be another way , okay ? Well , maybe there 's been ... I think there 's been some sort of misunderstanding . You shoot your little Ray gun there and hit my husband . That 's all I need to understand . Maybe not all . Aah ! Pete ! No ! It has to stay in ! This is probably gonna hurt ! It already does ... A lot ! Beth ! Pete ? Pete ! Jonah . I wish you 'd loved me more . Oh , baby . Those poor girls ... I wish you 'd loved me less . So this ... This is why we made that movie to send to ourselves . Because we knew we 'd not only get eyes on the artifact , but we 'd actually snag it . Yeah , but we can 't take it back to the future , so what was the point ? What if we could get it back to the future ? What if we could hide it somewhere we knew would exist 50 years from now , somewhere safe , somewhere where only we ... Could get to it . The Warehouse . But , Pete , we still need to make that movie , and we 're running out of time . When are we not running out of time ? Well , where in the hell are we gonna find a camera ? Huh ? 99 ... Would you believe the credenza ? Jonah . I don 't know how to explain this , but , um ... You 've gotta run . Run ? Why ? Roxanne , the other women , now your wife . You 're the prime suspect . But you can tell the police that it was Beth and that I 'm innocent . We can 't . We won 't be in town long enough to tell anyone anything . So where am I supposed to go ? St. Louis . You have to trust me . You 'll be safe in St. Louis . And ... We 're sorry to have to ask you this , but we need a favor . We need you to mail this movie . It will clear your name some day . Trust us . Jonah ? Good luck . We 're not gonna have enough time to get the knife back . How far are we from the Warehouse ? We can make it . They 're not gonna make it . We 're not gonna make it . We should have mailed the knife too . Are you kidding me ? Do you remember the last time someone mailed an artifact ? Oh , right . Dr. Doomsday-a-gogo . Aah ! Oh , God ! Ah ! Are you okay ? Yeah , yeah . It 's just the headaches are getting worse . What if- - what ? Just a little bit of history repeating . Rebecca said Jack kissed her under a tree in a cherry orchard . This must be where they woke up . We were coming here all along . Should we just leave the knife with Jack and Rebecca ? Well , we can 't . They won 't know what it is when they wake up . And they might think it 's a letter opener and glass themselves paying the electric bill . Uh ... How ' bout right here ? Okay . Here ? Yeah . We 'll have just enough time to get them back . If this works . The power 's not transferring . I don 't know what else to do . Pete , what are you doing ? Rebecca spent her whole life blaming herself because she couldn 't find the artifact . If I can tell her where it is- - Pete , it won 't work . It never works . The past can 't change . And neither can I. Back in the old days when things didn 't work ... Yeah , mine too . Works for me . Can 't you see ? We have to keep trying . If we just accept fate , then we 're no better than- - Are we back ? Are we in deep doo doo ? Oh , more than you can imagine . Oh , no , no , man . I dropped the note . You guys look ... Freaked out . Did--did something happen ? No . Did you see the artifact ? Not only did we see it ... We know where it is . It 's safe . Were you able to save any of those women ? Well , I guess you can 't change the past ... No matter how hard you try . That machine ... Does it still work ? Don 't tell us you want us to go back and get another artifact . No . But I would like to see Jack again . One more time . Well , t-the circuitry 's severely damaged , and the trip wouldn 't last more than a few moments . And ... I wouldn 't be able to bring you back . Why would I want to come back ? Hey . So , um , Pete recovered the knife . Good . Turns out that artifact was the basis of the Cinderella story . Only instead of how in the story a young girl meets a handsome prince who gives her a glass slipper ... Cinderella used the knife to ... Let 's just say they tend to reedit these things for children . We like things simple when we 're kids . Black and white , good and evil . Sometimes I wish things still were that simple . She did good , didn 't she ? Rebecca ? Yeah . She did real good . No , I meant , you know ... Helena . Yeah . And so did you . Becs ? Where the hell are we ? It 's okay . We 're all right . The last thing I remember , uh ... I was sitting in the Warehouse and- - it doesn 't matter . Jack , I missed you so much . Missed me ? Jack , what are you doing ? What I should have done a long time ago . Mm !

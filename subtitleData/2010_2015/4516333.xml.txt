Your uncle 's attorney . My deepest sympathies . His death came as a shocked all of us . He was a model of health and vigor . He just dropped dead in his study , not five minutes after sending word from me in the doctor . When I arrived he was already gone . And he 'd never stop digging . All over the world .. As soon as he started digging one hole , then he was off the Jawa . Or the Orkney Island to dig another . He said it was pure research but , It always seemed to me like , he was looking for something . Well . God granting , he 's found it now Every inch of cavalryman . to the very end . My mother always said that Jack Never really came back from the war . That it was only his body that went west . He 's used to tell the most wondrous stories . I 'd like to , pay my respects . You won 't find the key hole . The thing only opens from the inside . He insisted no embalming , no open coffin , no funeral .

Then they are our kind ... .. leave anything for the white apes . Where on earth am I ? ! Barsoom . A world on the brink . For Zodangas new power threatens to destroy our city of Helium . And if Helium falls . So does Barsoom . Rubbish . Goddess help me , I 'm hopeless . I always come too strong . Your Highness . Oh ! My Jeddak . My Jeddak . After years of tireless research , I present to you ... .. the answer . I hope . - My Jeddak , after years of ... .. - I 'm sorry Princess . Presentation will have to wait . Father , what 's happened ? Dejah . I know the terms set by Sab Than , what I want to know is can we afford to reject them ? Admiral Kantos Kan . The Eastern border is a wasteland . Sab Than has burned through our defenses , the boarder folk massacred . Our best troops and fleetest ships proven less than useless . And now comes word that our last remaining squadron , has been lost ! Helium is lost . My people . I fail them all . No my Jeddak . You haven 't . Forgive me my lady but you have not seen this weapon . It radiates the most intense blue light . Lunar light . When I read all report from Sab Than 's weapon I knew , Somehow that idiotic brute had discovered it first . Discovered what ? The Ninth Ray Unlimited power . Sab Than only uses it for slaughter . But think , of what Helium might accomplish with such power . Transform the deserts .. Restore the seas .. Is this what you saw Kantos ? It 's starting to look very close . Give it time . It will work . No ! Everyone leave us . Dejah . Ever since , you were a little girl , You 've always met the expectations placed on you . It 's Sab 's terms . What are they ? He will spare Helium , If you accept his hand in marriage . No ! - He is a monster . You must refuse him . - He is already on his way here . But all of my work , I just need a little more time . Dejah . How can you , You can 't just bow down to Zodanga .. A wedding will save the city . Hold ! Perhaps , but it could loose you Barsoom . Dejah ... . With no one to stop Zodanga will be the begining of the end . We do not ... we do not have the luxury . You are a Jeddak of Helium . - You must find another way ! - There is no other way ! If there were , I would risk anything to cease it . This is the chance we have been given ... .. perhaps ... . It is the will of the Goddess ... . No . It is your will . So when I was little , And we were look up at the stars . And you would tell me of the heros whose glory was written in the sky . How was there star up there for me ? Is this , what you imagine would be written on it ? My Jeddak . My Jeddak , Sab Than 's Corsair approaches the city . They signal for permisison to land . Grant it . And let us prepare ourselves for a wedding . I have destroyed the device , Matai Shang . She was on the verge of discovery . All is in place . They will consent to the wedding . Keep close to watch of her . We don 't wanna anything to interfere with our next move . Sarkoja . Let her have a hatchling . She can take the little white worm . Easy . What happened to you ? Hey ! hold on . Now we kill it . Back off . Tal Hagus ... You value this more then my judgment ? Step ... . Away . I issue a challenge . And who supports your challenge ? Who will pledge their weapon to me ? Call ? You are as blind as a white ape , Tal Hajus . You will not rule today . Maybe not today . See the prize your Jeddak has found ! is it ... a baby white ape ? No . It 's a rare legendary creature . And it 's called ... Vorginia ! Vor ... ginia ! Watch . Everyone step back ! Show them , Vorginia . Jump ! Jump ! Stubborn . I will make you jump , Virginia . Chain him up sole . Take him away ... and lock him with the other hatchlings . Wait ... Wait ... . Wait ... Poor baby . Drink this ... It will help . What 's in that stuff ? The voice of Barsoom . You can hear it if you choose . Easy ! Nice monster dog ... What the hell did you ? Quit it ! Stop it ! You 've killed him with one blow . I ... .. ... . wait I understood you . What have you done ? Get off ! Get off him ! How did this happen ? Who is to blame ? Do that again , and I swe ... Enough ! There is no room ... .. for another mark , Sola . Your next defence will be your last . You will jump Vorginia ... . Now ! Jeddak ! Flyers ! You are the stones and sand . Sir , they 're continue to ignore our signals . Enough ! Be patient on mote , let them die . If that 's how you plan to treat your future bride , It 's no wonders why she runs form you . Dejah Thoris must live . In range , Sir . We don 't cripple the ship . The pulse of the radium drive would be sufficient . Quick , clean , and precise . Jeddak , shall we destroy her ? No . We don 't need cripple her . Now bring it surround . Zodanga .. Helium . They 're the red flags . Helium blue Zodanga 's winning the war . But I say let red man kill red men untill only Tharks remain . - That don 't look like a fair fight . - The , Zodanga never fight fair . Where is she ? My Jeddak , that 's all of them . Whose coming this vanished in the village ? Check the deck .. ! We have sign . Pull over , now ! She 's a human . Sola . Who is that ? Yah ! That 's Vorginia . I beg your pardon Ma 'am . If you kindly just stand behind me , this might get dangerous . Or maybe I ought to get behind you ... You let me now when it gets dangerous . No . Take him alive . We are supposing to having this thing ... ... If I don 't get to use it . Leave it ! Who are you ? You 're not red man and you 're not quite white ape . You can still bleed like .. Tharks ! I surrender , you may take me captive . Didn 't I tell you he could jump . Ohh my God ! Hey dog back off ! You are ugly , but you are beautiful . And you fight , like a Thark . You lost your weight , you must eat . Jeddak of the Thark , I 'm Dejah Thoris . Regent of the Royal Helium Academy of Science . - My research found that you have ... - You research as a spoil ! Sola . - Tend to Virginia 's property . - Yes my Jeddak . You know once Sab Than has conquered us , he will turn his weapon upon you . I know that Zodanga has found a way to defeat you . And now you seek a mighty weapon of your own . But Virginia , fights for us . He will fight for Torquas in the South . with the Warhoon in the North . And he will become Dotar Sojat ... . My right arms . No . I don 't fight for anyone . Virginia ... You reject this honor .. then I can 't guarantee the safety of your red girl . All right ! I .. am Dotar Sojat . War is a shameful thing .. Not when a noble cause is taken out by those who can make a difference . You made a difference today , Virginia . Okay . See , my name ... is John Carter . Virginia is where I 'm from . Where did you learn to jump that way ? I don 't know . How did you learn to fly ? Your ships ... Cannot sail on light in Virginia ? No , Professor . See , our ships sail in the seas . Endless water everywhere . Skeleton structure normal ... . What are you doing ? It must be the density of your bones . Jump for me . Enough ... There will be time for playfulness later . I want no playfulness from him , I want his help . Explain to me how you do it ! If it 's a skill teach it to Helium . Name your price .. I 'm not for hire . I 've got a cave of gold of my own . Somewhere ! Only a madman would rave about the time of oceans . Is that your expert view ? I 'm mad ? Or liar . She is a good match for you Dotar Sojat . Don 't call me that ! There are no seas on the planet . You said planet . Sun . Then Rasoom . Mercury . Then Kosoom . Venus . Then Earth , Us . That is Jasoom . You are on Barsoom . John Carter . Mars ? I 'm on Mars . Good God . I 'm on Mars . So ... . Your home is Jasoom ? And you came on one of your sailing ships . Across .. million of Karads of empty space ? No . Not like that . Go on . Shock me ! How ? That brought me here . Ohh ! That explains everything then . It does ? Yes . You 're a Thern . And you simply wish to return to your rightful place , isn 't that it ? Yes . Then let 's sort this out right now . Come along . Where are you going ? To your temple . No . No .. You cannot enter here . It is forbidden . You are not Thark . woola stay here . Dejah ... It is forbidden . It is forbidden . Well ... You speak for the Goddess . What is she say ? You call me a Thern , Is that what she is ? No . She is Issus . Therns are holly messenger of the Goddess .. In the time of oceans they walked among us , guiding us . We must not offend . Let us go . There is some kind of writing up there . Can you read it ? Yes . It 's old scripture . I .. I ... Try this again .. What 's it mean ? Don 't rush me . For those who seek the solace of eternity , May journey down the river , Through the secret gates of Iss . And find everlasting peace , In the bosom of Issus . The Gates of Iss . What if , I could take you there ? What if , I didn 't trust you ? Then we 'd be even . I can take you to the Gates . To the answers that you seek . A way back to Jasoom . Earth ... . Earth . So this I can do to repay you from getting us out of here . Assuming that you can . Deal . Go on . Shake it . This is a sign of trust . Good enough . Now all I need to do is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas . Dotar Sojat . Useless shake alot . I told you it is forbidden . What in the name of Issus is going on ? Issus has been profaned . We found this one and red wench clotting in the temple . In the temple ! How did they get ... Sola , let them there . Sola tried to stop us . I meant no disrespect to your Goddess , Tars . I 'm just trying get home . Your right arms were ... . planning to rob you of the medallion .. and use it to commit greater blasphemy .. down the river Iss . They must all die in the arena . How could you do this ? I spared your life .. I made you Dotar Sojat , yet ... her life means nothing to you . You knew ! You knew here no room for another mark . Now Sola will die because of you . She 's you daughter . Isn 't she ? Who told you that ? Call it a father 's intuition . A Thark has no parent with the horde . But how do you know ? Her mother kept her egg .. and Sola is the last flicker of her ancient greatness . You can 't stand here and let her be killed . My right arms offend me , I will cut them off ! No ! You must hurry ... . I mean to release you . I make one condition . You take Sola with you down the river Iss . My Jeddak ! I 'd rather you died in the arms of the Goddess than as foods for wild banths in the arena . Where you go , she goes . What 's gonna happend to you Tars ? Only the Tharks , his head in one hand and he may yet concur . Is it done my Jeddak ? Tars Tarkas betrays us . Woola . You belong to him . Woola would follow you anywhere of Barsoom . It 's three days right .. Follow me ! What 's happend to this place ? Zodanga happened . Sailing on light . Still playing the madman ? Or the liar . Keep moving ! We 'll get there . Why pursue this wedding any longer , I 've already one . Not yet . It was to impass the horizon Sab Than . It 's true demoralizing nation requires a public spectacle on grandest scale . Stating this wedding will ensure your rule goes unchallenged . If you insist . You cannot see the wisdom in that then we will find another who can . Dotar Sojat . Carter ! I do not think she leads us to the Iss . All right then Sola . Just play along ... Yah . What do you think I do when I saw your city and not some river ? What do you mean ? Kloras and Thoria . they should be at our backs by now . You lead us toward Helium . Once we reach there ... You would see for yourself the virtue of our cause . Everyone thinks their cause is virtuous , Professor . What are you doing ? ! No ! John Carter ! You can 't ! I like this plan better . Just wait ... She 'll come around . You mad fool ! You 're not from Earth ! I 'm innocent . I only told you with you wanted to hear so you get us out . Stop ! I can 't . I cannot marry him ! Can 't marry who ? The Zodangan Jeddak you 've fought . Sab Than . He offered a truce to my father in exchange for my hand . Your father ? Tardos Mors . The Jeddak of Helium . She is a Princess . Princess of Mars . How about that ? A Princess who didn 't wanna get married . So she ran away . No . Is that all there is to this story ? No . I didn 't ran away ! I escaped . From what , His breath ? So marry the guy and save your people . A life of oppression , that 's not living ! If you had the means to save others , would you not take any action possible to make it so ? No good wil come out of me to fighting ' your war . I would lay down my life for Helium . Yes . I ran away . I was afraid . Weak . Maybe , I should 've married . but I so feared that it would somehow be the end of Barsoom . I tell you truely . John Carter of Earth . There are no Gate of Iss . They are not real . I 'm sorry Princess . But this , this is real . And so is my Cave of Gold . Who is in demand for taking escort ? No . I 'll go alone General . Jeddak . No sweep . I can put an end in 2000 years of civil war and bring Helium to its knees forever . But my Agenda , in his superior wisdom .. objects ! isn 't that right ? ! This taught me talk like you . Hector , they have reached the Iss . It took them longer than I thought . If they should reach the gates ... They can breach the sanctuary . And her knowledge of The Ninth Ray is already As advanced as it will ever be . Patient brothers . It is under my control . I 'm already there . The Iss . Here pilgrims must leave behind all they have . All they know . Never to returned . If The Goddess find me worthy . Wait ! What you think you 're doing ? It is my way Dotar Sojat , not yours . I must honor my Jeddak and redeem my own unworthiness . You wanna honor your father ? And stay alive and help me . My father ? Sola . Why would you say that ? That what 's drive your compassion . The blood of your father . Tars Tarkas . And of all the Tharks . You are the only one worthy of him . And your duty to your father demands that you see me through . Just help me find the Gates . Then you can decide what honor requires . Just toward Gates then . Woola stay ! Other pilgrims . Professor . Impossible . I never seen this kind of structure before . I will get a better look . Carter , your feet ! This is not the work of God . These are machines . Your medallion . The spider . Nine . Nine Rays . Nine . The Ninth Ray is real It 'll be harnessed , Do you see ? The entire structure runs on Ninth Ray isolates . The Iss is such power , Such power . That somehow Zodanga has it . Therns . They must be real . And you . John Carter of Earth ? Yes Maam . And the ships . That sail on the sea . You 've seen them . That 's must be a beautiful sight . It truely is . It 's a ... Solar System . What it 's saying ? I 'm not sure . Ok . What do you think is this ? It appears to be ... . kind of technical diagram . Here is Barsoom and here is Jasoom . This glyph here It 's like our symbol for Transcription . A copy sent along these lines here . between the worlds . like ... the telegram . You saying I was telegraphed here . I 'm a copy of myself . Possibly making these words here . The command for travel . I don 't longer think I need more information .. I need .. Charts , codices . Wait . Where might we found those ? In the Hall of Science . And where is that ? Helium . Quick ! That you said on it , turn on back to Helium . Why did you take me for ? I take you for a man who 's lost . I won 't be lost if you just tell me how to work this thing . I will . But everything I need to understand that medallion is in Helium . I 'm trying get you back to your cave of gold . Isn 't that what you want ? Yes . No . I don 't believe you . We may have been born worlds apart . But I know you , John Carter . On the moment you caught me in the sky ... . I knew , I felt the heart of a man willing to laid on his life for others . The man willing to fight for a cause . Here . On Barsoom . Don 't you see ? Carter ? I fled to find another way . You are the other way . Dotar Sojat ! Warhoon . Dotar Sojat ! Pursue them to the Helium Plane then overtake them and capture the red woman alive . The one who jumps ? Let 's see what he 's capable of . Yaah ! Corpse . Hold . Dotar Sojat . What are you doing ? Sola get her out of here . No ! Carter ! I was too late once , I won 't be again . No ! No ! Woola go ! Go damn you ! Father ! Thank you Goddess ! Carter .. Ohh , Ohh .. Thanks Issus . Who is he ? His name is John Carter .. He saved my live . He 's from Jasoom . Jasoom ? Zodanga 's closer , he 'll have my personal physician . He shot me out of the sky ! Daughter listen to me . Listen to me . Sab has admitted to everything . And he came to me alone without an escort . I could have held him in prison . I could have him killed . Yet this was clear he only care about your safety . I feared you to be tortured by the Tharks . and condemned to die in their arena . I could not live with that on my conscience . I do have one , Princess . Really ? I thought you had it removed along with ... . Dejah ! She does not trust me , Jeddak . And why should she ? There 's never been trust between Zodanga and Helium . Therefore Princess I offer you the small but sincere ... . token of my good will . My life . Dejah . You hold the power , princess . The power of life . Over me and over all Barsoom . With our two cities united , anything is possible . All you have to do is marry me . This is Helium ? Ssssgh ... ! No ! Ohh ! Zodanga . For the men are limited as the menu .. And the women are as hard as the best . What 's your business here ? He is my business . Let 's just assume we taking him to more secure accommodation . We receive no such orders . But you are receiving them now ! Straight from the laughing lips of Sab Than himself . I heared that you are incredibly dangerous . Take me hostage . What ? Take me hostage . Are you allright ? Help ! help ! The white imbecile ! He takes my sword ! Guards ! They 're up front .. You 're the crazy man , let me be with my sword . Carter , this way . Right . Your turn . My turn ? Who are you ? My name is Kantos Kan . I serve Princess Dejah . Dejah ? From what she tells me ... You can get us over .. there ... She said , I can make that ? Or we can get surrender . Is that what you do what Jasoom , huh ? Come on . Hello ladies . You are expected to bow in my presence Captain Carter . Bow . Suppose that will do . I have fetched him as you commanded . Thank you Kantos . I wish to speak to Captain Carter alone . Keep watch outside . Now girls , off we go . You look beautiful . It 's a tradition of Zodangan . Worn by the groom 's mother I 'm told . It 's a little vulgar of for my taste , But my opinions about to became irrelevant . You can 't seriously be considering this . What other choice do I have ? Don 't marry him . Give me reason not to . Will you stay and fight for Helium ? Will you stay , and fight for Helium ? Dejah , We have saying on Barsoom . " A warrior , may change his metal " " but not his heart " You were right . I could decipher the command . It 's a set of sounds . A simple phrase . Repeat after me . Ok .. ohum .. okte .. 934 01 : 24 : 54,392 - - 01 : 24 : 55,850 Open the door ! Say it now ! Ok .. ohum .. okte .. Dejah . Open the door ! You all right Dejah ? Ok .. ohum .. okte .. Weez . Weez . Jasoom Open this door ! Jasoom say it ! Say it ! say it ! Dejah ! You 're alone ? Yes . I 'm alone . Well , my Jeddak , The moons will soon be rising , Let us not delay the proceedings any further . Yes . Yes , of course . We have plenty of time to talk . Now . Who are you ? Ohh .. American ? Who are you , Sir ? Sir ? Definitely the South . The Carolinas , Virginia ? It 's Virginia , isn 't it ? Lovely place . You know it ? Not as well as I should . But I will . Hadwa , what 's the hold up ? Sorry sir streets are blocked . It 's the wedding procession . Increased strength and agility . Simple matter of gravitation and anatomy , one we ought to have foreseen . We ? No apparent increase in intelligence . Still . This will not do at all . Your kind of Earthmen projecting themselves over here , leaping about , causing all manner of disruption . You are a Thern . Therns are a myth . Hadwa , we 'll go on the forth . My name is Matai Shang . and I do not exist . Indeed . I work very hard at it . Excuse me .. It 's a shame really . She 's a remarkable creature and she came very close indeed . You mean The Ninth Ray ? It is no consequence now . After tonight ceremony .. when the two moons met and the vows are exchanged .. she and anyone else with knowledge of The Ninth Ray will be eliminated . In effect cutting the head off the beast . Quick , clean and precise . Shame , there 's not one to warn her . The balance must be restored . What gives you the right to interfere ? Do you care ? This is not your home . you have no obligation to these people . You don 't have a dog in this fight . It 's not how said in Virginia ? A man without a cause . So what is your cause ? We have not . We are not haunted by mortality , as you are . We , are eternal . I don 't understand . The wedding this little stroll . Why not just kill me , kill Dejah ? History will follow the cause we have set , Earthman . And we 've chosen Sab Than to rule next . The Ninth Ray must remaining in the hands of mindless brood we can control And the infamy of Dejah Thoris as his wedding death , will seal his reign . We 've been playing these games since before this planet , and we 'll continue to do so long after the death of yours . We don 't cause the destruction of the world Captain Carter . We simply manage it . Feed of it , if you like . All every host planet it always place out exactly the same way . Population 's rise , Societies divide , Wars spread . World wide . The neglected planet slowly fades . Prepare two man-flyer , for prisoner transport . Yes sir . Immortal ain 't bullet proof . I shot one of you back on earth . Come on . I 'm trying . I 'm trying . Guards after him ! Colonel Powell ! Uhh ! ohh ! Ula . I told you , Woola would follow you anywhere . You did alot more than just that . Wait , Wait . Where are you going ? To save Dejah . And I 'll need an army to do it . Get on . No . Tharks do not fly . Hello . Tars they going to kill De ... .. Dejah . This is truely rewards the chase . I see the dead . Tars . The Virginia I knew .. traveled to Iss . What have they done to you ? Tal challenged . I lost . Virginia , When I saw you leap in to the sky , I wished , to believe it was a sign . That something new can coming to this world . That the greatness of our Thark race might rise again . But . It is too late . My daughter is with her mother in paradise , There is a comfort in that . Tars . Sola . Actually she is here , with me . THis is how you repay your debt to me ? Tars . I need my sword . that it would half your thoughtless head from your body ! Helium there . Up now , we go . It is time . Nonsense . Nonsense . Leave a Thark his head in one hand and he may yet concur , right ? ohh ! Your spirit annoys me . Are these is your work ? Banths . Weakness , sentiment . Allowing this white worm , To contaminate the horde . These are the crimes of Tars Tarkas . We are united because we call our freaks . We are strong because we despise weakness . Let them be crushed , like unhatched eggs . Is that a banth ? No . It 's just so white ape . Run . Tars , Give me your hand Tars . You have four there , man . Give me one . Father . Father ? Tars . Hey over here you , blind monkey . Release the other one ! Watch your father die . Like when he cut us his head . No . Let us watch you . Sola . Are you mad ? No . The blood of my father drive 's me . Vorgi ... ... nia ! Vorgi ... .. nia ! I claim you right of challenge ! You have no right to challenge ! You are not Thark ! He is Thark ... ! He is Dotar Sojat ! Dotar Sojat ! Dotar Sojat ! You will fight till man to die . The Jeddak of Zodanga means to quash Helium this very night , And if Helium falls , So does Barsoom . We must throw out the thought of old hatreds . Tharks did not cause this ! But by Issus Tharks will end it ! We ride for Zodanga ! I know that this not the fate you have chosen for yourself , Or for Helium . The choice is a luxury even for a Jeddak of Barsoom . Even if in your heart ... My heart ... .. is a luxury . Steady . Remember she is not the prize . The prize is Barsoom . Hey , you ! Why Zodanga aren 't defended ? Where is every one ? Behind this position . Outside Helium . Only a small contagion remain ... . What 's happend to Dejah Thoris ? Where are they ? At the wedding in Helium . No ! No ! I have made my decision . It 's the only way to get there in time . Tharks do not fly . So be it . This is madness Dotar Sojat . You 'll die . Then I see you down the river Iss . Go to the canal , be careful . The moon light will force you to fly low . Like our ancestors before us . We gather under the mingled light of Barsooms first lovers , Kloras and Thoria . As the moons are joined in celestial union , so do we unite Sab Than and Dejah Thoris . Zodanga and Helium . No ! It 'll raise the alarm . It 's one of us . In the time of oceans , the celestial lovers rose from the sea each night to consummate their love in the sky . Drink now , of this holy water and be wed . So might it be again . I am yours forever . And I 'm yours , forever . Carter . It 's a trap , The dangers at your walls . Now , do it now ! Helium falls . Attack now . Dejah . You will get behind me sir . Carter . You have such a nice wedding ! Yes . - Helium 's fate is sealed Earth man . - As is yours . Thank the Goddess , that 's over with . Virginia ! It is taught to fly . Why they still fight with us ? Brother ! Helium might thank . You gonna tell me everything you know about the Therns . You spare me , and I 'll tell you . A fitting solution for Sab Than . What did you say Captain ? Dejah Thoris survives her assasin but will fail to prove a misguided theory of The Ninth Ray Yes . Yes , I 'll enjoy playing that out . Carter . I 'm getting away . Tars , The Medallion . Give it to me , my Jeddak . No . I 'll explain later . You have won , my Jeddak . All is finished . Not quite . Jeddak . I see you have changed your metal . It in my heart . Dejah Thoris . Would Princess of Mars . Ever consider marriage to a wayward , Virginia Cavalry man , With nothing to offer ? Yes . John Carter . Yes . By the ancient rite of the moons and water ... are you bond together , Husband and Wife . John . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't sleep . I had that feeling you get suddenly that . I had that feeling you can 't settle either ... .. you left a light burning or a door open . Go back to bed . I won 't be long . Back in once that . John Carter of Earth . John Carter of Earth . John Carter of Mars . Sounds much better . Sir ! I must express the deepest gratitude for saving Helium . Please . The honor is mine . Fair enough Earth man . Now it 's your move . Ok ohum okte Weez . Jasoom No ! Ok. ohum. okte ... Weez ... Barsoom .. Ok. ohum. okte . Weez ... Barsoom Bar ... Barsoom Fifty milion miles apart .. no way to bridge the gap And no way to return my body and my soul to their true home . Like a fool I 'd thrown away my medallion Then I recalled Matai Shang , His knowledge of Earth , of my history . It meant Therns were present on this world . The cave in Arizona was proof . There might be other such proofs , other Thern ways stations hidden all the around the world . I knew now what the cave of gold must be used for . So for ten bitter years I searched . On the trail of rumor and legend I fared it out every possible evidents of the Therns . But I found no medallion . And then .. it came to me . Once it came there many plans I had to make in secret . I could trust no one else . I have long suspected that the Therns were following my movements . Sir . I feel remarkably unwell Thompson . Please send for the doctor . Yes sir . And Thompson , My attoreny as well . Of course , Sir . Now you will understand the cause of my sudden death . The reason for my bizzarre funeral instructions . Why the door can only be opened , from the inside . Forth my body dies on Earth , then my copy dies on Mars . You are the key ! This is the task I entrust to you along with my own fortune . Protect my body . The Therns will attempt to destroy it . In the time it is you taking to read these pages they may already done so . I 'm the key . I , Edgar . Ed . E D Ed . Dear Ned . He never called me Edgar . He called me Ned . Hello Ned . Toxin . Derive from pufferfish simulates death . I mean , You 've never found the medallion . No . That 's why I 'm so grateful to you for bringing me one . I , I was just a bait ? No . You are far more than that . I really do need a protector . That is if you want , Ned . Good bye Ned . Ohh ! Ned . Take up a cause . Fall in love . Write a book . Just telling I wanna home . Ok ... ohum ... okte ... Weez ... ... Barsoom .. ... Barsoom ..

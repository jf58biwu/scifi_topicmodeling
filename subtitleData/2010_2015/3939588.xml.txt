Started construction of a nuclear graveyard on territory of Nizhniy Novgorod . - Go . - Bullet will pass through , I 'll kill the journalist . Two frags with one shot . It is known that the Altiplano , the region where palladium has been found , is controlled by rebel forces . Do you not think this enterprise to be too risky ? The province of Altiplano is not under control of local government . We will make investments , only when Villiermo and others like him are destroyed . We will come to Altiplano to stay for long . Doc , we 've been cheated . - Unit 2 , Unit 3 , withdraw ! - Are you crazy ? Remember the Latin guy for whom we showed off our skills ? His name was Villiermo . Even if Don Pedro , he 's getting away ! They are not special forces ! Zaritsyn just wants their palladium . Bro , this is our job , we are being paid money for it , understand ? To murder a business competitor ? Palladium , Villiermo ... You 're right . Put away the rifle . Behind you ! Knock out 12 . Doc , so much blood ! Where is it coming from ? Press on it ! Press ! - What do we do , Doc ? - Call the police ! Idiots ! - Doc , what have you done ? - I striked out . Rita ! Doc , you destroyed the bus ? Did I have a choice ? Quickly ! Come on . Speed off ! Rita ? - Rita ! - I 'll drive . IN THE GAME 2 : A New Level Hello ! Get me Proskulin , say it 's Lebedev , urgent . Oleg Anatolievich , we 're bringing you a girl . She 's got a gunshot wound . Don 't know . It might be severe . Alright . We 'll be there in 10 minutes . Dima . Our doctor will see her . You 'll have 5 minutes . Then we 'll leave her and will return to base . Understand ? Understand ? You understand ? - You can 't go there , young man . - Will she live ? Yes or no ? She has a gun wound to the chest . We 'll stop the bleeding , but then a cardiac surgeon must take a look . So , for now I cannot say anything . You should go wash up . A letter . Lock the doors and don 't turn off the engine . I 'll be back soon . I 'm here to see Mr. Shimich , I 'm Pokrovsky . A Pokrovsky is here . - Let him in . - Go up . Come on , come on . I 'm waiting for you . Greetings once again . - Harris called you Mr. Pokrovsky . - Yes . I thought we should get to know each other better . Your first name and patronymic ? - Victor Petrovich , just call me Victor . - Nice to meet you . I 'm Dario . We , Croatians , don 't have patronymics , but I 've lived in Russia for so long ... that I started thinking I should make one up . Don 't keep looking back at your van . Nothing 's gonna happen to it . By the way , the best way to attract the attention of a pickpocketer ... is to keep holding onto your pocket . What do you have there ? " Communists ' Gold " ? No ! Just very important documents . Even if you have 20 carat diamonds in there , I will still charge you a fixed rate for transit . How are you ? Where 's Dima ? Your boyfriend ? He left . Left you a letter and left . Under the pillow . Don 't move a lot , stitches were just put in place , it may start bleeding . Rita , forgive me that I had to leave you . I cannot be with you right now , I had to go with the guys . Take my credit card and withdraw cash . Max will tell you the code . I can 't explain anything . Just trust me that this needs to be done and I 'll fix everything . I love you very very much . Sit down and eat , loverboy . - Is she back yet ? - In the shower . Before that she was in class . I 'm feeling next time I 'll call she 'll either have drowned or gotten married . - From her ? - No , from Vampire . That Vampire ! He 'll get you involved in his games again . One day I 'll have to tell him what I think . Something happened ? Nah , it 's nothing . Just lost a tournament . It 'll be $ 60,000 for everything , plus my tax . Where 's the guarantee ? If a guarantee wasn 't included , the tax would 've been much lower . Excuse me please . Yes , Mr. Harris . I 've met Dario . I 'm on his ship right now . Okay , I 'll see you in 5 days . Forgive me please . So ... We need to wire you the initial payment , and we can load ? Well , if you still insist on loading a closed container ... Yes . Then we 'll use a crane to load . You can transfer the money right now , there is wire connection on the bridge . But would you like my advice ? You should not ship this cargo . Why is that ? I have been in this business all my life , though usually the people who do this don 't live longer than 2 years . Say I wanted to start designing airplanes right now ? Well ... I understand there is risk . But without risk there is no ... I also thought this way 30 years ago , and one time I took a risk . Still want to risk ? Load the container . Operation was started according to plan , but our position on the roof came under unexpected gunfire . A battle broke out . What does the group leader have to say ? I must have walked too close to the window , and I was noticed . If it wasn 't for Doc ... Please allow him to lead the team instead of me . This was not good . Yes , sometimes the police turn up at the wrong place at the wrong time . Yes ? It 's a pity about the bystander casualties . It 's a pity about your friend ... - Long . - Kostya . It 's a pity about Kostya . When can we take her ? Well , you can 't make an omelet without breaking eggs . You have done the job . Yes , I understand . Good job ! Sergey , I will be with the doctor . Keep her there with you for now . That 's all . You 're free . Dima . I need a word with you . Rita has regained consciousness . Her wound is not serious . In three days she will be released from the hospital , but you must understand ... given the information that she knows there is no possibility for her to leave the game . She must be with us . If anything ... I will have no choice . She will be with us . Mosquito , Mosquito , enough drinking . Enough drinking . To Long . Yan . Long wanted to have a tattoo like this . Like " no one will get away from us . " If we had 20 of such disks , we 'd have our own enterprise . - " The Wolf Pack . " - What pack ? We have nothing of our own now . Do you get that ? We 're stuck in here for life . Mosquito , calm down . Briefing in the morning . Go to bed . Monitoring is on . Clean . Work the political side , financing of political parties , conflict among their leaders . What 's in the news ? Zaritsyn 's murder is the most discussed topic . - Keep monitoring . - Yes , sir . What 's with the bait ? It 's all ready . Victor Petrovich , I found out an important thing . The effects of your disks are dangerous . Your son may be harmed . Good . Prepare the satellite signal , I will call Boris Sergeevich . Sergey Victorovich , this is minor , but still . Cabin 6 , computer is away on Radmin . - What does this mean ? - I can no longer see his computer . Can only say that he is now in mIRC . - Where ? - A closed chat channel for gamers . Cut the connection . MAX : What are you getting me into ? VAMPIRE : Do , as I ask . VAMPIRE : I must stay with them to find the disks . Coffee ? Once off duty . Thank you . Is there internet connection ? I 'm not interrupting ? - Need the computer ? - Yeah . You have half an hour . Once we are out of the range of the satellite the connection will be lost . That 'll be enough . I just need to send a letter . Damn ! - Throw away the telephone . - I 've been thinking about that too . I am serious . Throw the phone into the sea . Right now ! Only two people know this number . This is my agent from Russia . Yes , Oleg , what do you have ? Victor Petrovich , I found out an important thing . - The effect of your ... - What 's wrong with your voice ? ... danger . Your son may get hurt . Are you drunk ? We have coordinates . We have object location . The signal disappeared , but we were able to establish its source . The ship is headed to Bosphorus . We can catch up to them . We tracked down this ship in the vicinity of Bosphorus strait . Satellite images present us with a very interesting picture . Cargo ship " Berix " . Registered in Istanbul . Owner Dario Shimich , professional smuggler , middle-man . In his youth tried to hit the jackpot by ferrying a large shipment of cocaine , but pirates captured the cargo . This mark means " debt " . Shimich is paying it to this day . Mostly by smuggling precious metals primarily from Ukraine . Fluently speaks Russian . The next gentleman should be very familiar to all of you . - He opened the gaming tournament . - Victor Pokrovsky , President of company Virtus . With the help of Shimich he 's trying to smuggle abroad 8,000 copies of disks you 're all familiar with . Supposedly to USA . Best time to attack the ship is upon its exit from Bosphorus . You will approach the ship on a motor boat , pretending to be tourists . Our people will help you on site . My name is Bond . James Bond . Quiet , you 're not in school . Any questions ? I have a question . How much ? Are we risking our necks second time around for that same " advance payment " ? Tomorrow $ 50,000 will be transferred to your accounts . Another $ 100,000 when we have the disks . It 's nice to work for a serious enterprise . Four of these charges divide among yourselves . This is enough to sink the whole ship . The sealed container is not a problem . This special medicine will help you to find out the code to the safe . Scopolamine is in each of these . Shevelikova , post-operation crisis 38,2 . We gave her analgen . Maybe also antibiotic ? - Give her tsifran . - Valerieva 's catheter was changed . - And that other girl who remained here ... - What ? During the night . Probably a blood clot . They took her away already . Hello . Where is the girl with the gun-shot wound ? - Just brought her in . - Show me . Under-rib artery , I think the blood clot must have gone to the lungs ... Later . There is a painkiller here and a powerful stimulant . Yeah , stimulant . We 'll shoot him up with ... Quit fooling around . Yes . Dimon . When ? I am leading ? As we had agreed . I am very sorry , but last night ... Rita died . Yes ! Close it up . Her family will be contacted . Autopsy on Monday . I will write the final report . Alright . Wake up ! - Almost froze to death . - I raised temperature even more . Here . - What face paint is this ? - My clients don 't complain . $ 200 doesn 't divide evenly among 3 . There 's also the nurse . You 'll share . We agreed to $ 200 , you got $ 200 . Alright , we 'll give her $ 10 each , should do . And if you don 't want to go into the freezer yourselves , then you know nothing , where she disappeared you don 't know . The rats ate her . Clear ? Couldn 't be clearer . Let 's drive to another ATM . Vampire ordered to withdraw all the money , or the card might get blocked . I 'm not going anywhere , until you explain everything . You appear in the middle of the night like a lunatic , say scary things , put me into a freezer . What is going on ? Explanation for dummies ... Vampire tried to stop them , but couldn 't do it . Now he wants to be part of the operation of capturing the disks , so that he can destroy them . But most important for him is that you hide yourself and tell him where . - Do you know what " mIRC " is ? - Something like a chat . Yes , there are closed channels on it , I will tell you the password . Grandmasters - Vampire 's team and topic number . You leave a message there saying how to find you . Can we go now ? Max , thank you . I owe him one . Also , I have a request . You guys finish up that game , and don 't get me involved in it anymore , alright ? - My name is Zats . Yan Zats . - So ? I am flying to save the world . Move along , cool guy ! I am flying . I am " Doctor . " There . Sergey Victorovich , my name is Boris Komelev . Can I have 5 minutes of your precious time ? Regarding what matter ? I have information for you . Call me in 10 minutes , can 't talk now . Dima . Try to forget your personal problems . At least until your return . Go on . Yes , this is no longer a model . It 's all from that core ? Yes , but , unfortunately , there exist a number of economic difficulties . Making the element out of palladium is very expensive , this technology will become profitable only in case of significant cost reduction of original material . Partying , the loaded pimps . Darios , what ? What is happening ? Artem ! Artem ! - Artem ! - Dad , I 'm here . - Don Dario , what happened ? - Is it a raid ? Yes , you should have listened to me , Victor Petrovich . To raid a ship in this proximity to the shore means they want your cargo really badly . - Do we have even one chance ? - Yes , we do . You forget all your plans , and I get off this ship as fast as possible . Follow them . Doc . Easy , easy , easy . Bon journo , guys . I am the owner of this ship . Who you are I don 't know , but I suppose that there must be a particular goal behind your actions . - We 're out of beer snacks . - Open the door . Of course , I will open , but I 'll tell you one thing ... The person who knows the pass code to the safe that is down below ... is handcuffed down in the engine room . In 10 minutes he will be shot in the head . There are two options . If you don 't really need him , then ... my game is lost before ever starting . If you do need him , then I would prefer ... to leave the ship along with the crew . Doc , we 're not here for frags . Maybe we should minus them ? To hell , we made an agreement . Guys , listen to me ... Guys , listen to me . Guys . - Young people ! - Go first . We know each other . Let 's make a deal ! What do you need , money ? Money ? How much money do you need ? A billion yuan [ Chinese ] , have it ? How much will that be in dollars ? Am I the currency exchange ? Why are you playing dumb ? You don 't get why we 're here ? Code to open the safe ! Code ! I don 't know the code . I ... I only deliver the cargo . The code knows the person for whom I deliver the cargo . Listen , storyteller , you 'll be playing dumb with your fellow-crooks in the alley , got it ? If you don 't tell us the code to the safe , I will kill your son ! - One ! - Wait ! I am counting to three . Two ! Dad ! But if I ... But if I say , you will still kill ? Don 't know , we 'll see . But if you don 't say , we will kill certainly . Two and a half ! - Three ! - Doc , don 't ! There 's a simpler way . We have the drug . Listen , I forgot about it . - Why ? - So he wouldn 't get in my way . Yan , the drug . Let me hold it . We 'll talk in a minute . We 'll talk now . - What are you doing , Dima ? - Yan , I am sorry . Doc , do you remember your words near Matvey 's house ? " There will be hundreds like us , the whole world will become one game of Counter . We must hurry to grab our own piece . " We must destroy the disks . Losing your senses again , pacifist ? Go count your own frags on upper deck . A boat is coming for us . - We go back and get paid . - Doc , I killed in battle , and I understood that these were human beings . You killed a guy for nothing and for you it 's just a " minus . " The disks made us all go nuts . Don 't , you know that I 'll be faster . Not sure . Should we check ? - What the hell . - Hands behind the head ! Leave me the explosive and go on deck . One iron sight won 't hold down 3 people . It will hold . Doc , Vampire is right . We need to destroy the disks . 8,000 disks is 8,000 others like us . Think , if the company gets them , what are we going to be worth ? Nothing ! At any moment they 'll be able to make new ones . Because of this I side with Vampire . Take their weapons . On deck . - Move it . Hands behind your head . - What a bitch you are , Yan ! How long does the drug effect last ? Will we have time to find out the code ? We can do another shot . - Thank you , Yan . - You 're welcome . Doc , your gun . Dimon , Dimon ! Dimon ! Hey , Dimon ! Dimon ! And now , Dimon , we will really take all our explosives , and will explode you along with them . - Mosquito , take what is left there . - Let 's go . Mosquito , Yan took care of Pokrovsky , boxes with disks we load onto the boat together . Vampire , have a drink , it won 't be as scary . Doc , wait . Let 's get farther away . - Is the plane ready ? - Ready since morning . Take some men from the guard , let them help Villiermo . Mr. Merkado , we will give you the disks we promised right now . I had no doubt . Money was already wired . The weapons will start arriving in a few days . Our people will see you to your plane . The transfer of mercenaries would have taken about half a year . With the help of disks you will be able to begin military action in the coming days . Good luck . Nice to do business with you , Mr. Lebedev . Asset withdrawal will be gradual . I have developed a two-year plan , I want you to start working on it immediately . Oil juncture is holding up . The question is how long it will last . - Is this serious ? - Just like my chest pain . Would you continue to hold capital in the stock of steam engine cars , if you had a patent for diesel ? A new company will control the technology , a factory for producing palladium elements , and a third of world supply of palladium . The stock control package has your name on it . Dad ! Get ready ... to change history , son . Hello , Sergey Victorovich . How was the drive ? Didn 't get lost without a driver ? I was guided by the sound of water . Judging by the place selected for the meeting , the conversation is meant to be strictly between the two of us ? More strictly than you can imagine . I am listening . I am representing the holding of Terranko that you know about . The information that I would like to share concerns the recently killed President of this holding Zaritsyn . Why do you think that this will be interesting to me ? Is it not ? It is interesting . But not more than any other big murder . And less than , say , the murder of Kennedy . Yes . Not quite . You were born two months after the murder of Kennedy , and could not possibly have planned it . But the murder of Zaritsyn took place with your direct involvement . I regret having wasted 2 hours for nothing . Listen , it was not in my plans to try scaring you . I was ordered to tell you that we are grateful to you . Zaritsyn 's leadership was not liked by us for a long time . You took him out quite nicely . Unfortunately , we do not have the option of acting so boldly , and your patron is very much interested ... in technologies that are of interest to us . Conflict of interests requires somebody 's help . We would price it at ... 7 million . Why not 10 ? Are you asking as a man of business or just out of curiosity ? I want to understand , how serious is your offer . More than serious . You found the wrong person . Relay the message that Boris Sergeevich 's security will be increased . That is right . Who are you ? Dima ! Where is he ? - Hi . - Hi , pooh-bear ! - Hi . - You scared me . - For you . - Thanks . - Let me help you . - Have you been waiting long ? Had time to memorize all the graffiti signs . Dimon loves Andrey . Masha is a goat . No , Dimon loves Masha , and Andrey is the goat around here . He really is a goat , he took off the steering wheel and pedals off his bike . Maybe his toy horse got all broken . Well , yeah . Lena , tell me , are you free next Sunday ? - Why ? - I want to invite you to the theater ... " Notre Dam De Paris . " To the theater ? I 'd really love to go , only Oleg does not like theater . Really ? But I like it . Maxim . I can 't , and please don 't stalk me , alright ? Stalking is when you are certainly against it , but when you are uncertain , then it 's trying to win you over . But winning over too . If Oleg finds out ... Is that the only problem ? Lena , let 's do it this way , if you love Oleg then say it now and then we 'll be just friends , like Pooh-Bear and Tiger . But if you are just scared or something else , then let me talk to him myself . Do you love him ? - Maxim , I don 't know ... - Do you like him ? - How can I tell you ? - Then don 't think about anything . Take it . Take the tickets , I 'll call you . I told you it will start ! Training is over . Let 's work with you some more . Work your hip more . Again ! - Alright , enough . - Till tomorrow . Good day , Oleg . I 've seen better . Here for training ? 500 rubles . No , I 'm more into computers . Just wanna talk . - Just to talk is also 500 rubles . - Are you seeing Lena ? I want to ask her out to the theater . You won 't object ? What 's with you , hacker ? Lost your mind ? Are you high on something ? Go get sleep and eat some coal . That 's it , you 've asked for it ! - Who trained you ? - There was this one " master " . Vong Kar Vai . I see . To put it simply , in guys terms , I don 't have anything going on with this Lena . We 've been dating for about a month , things haven 't gone any further than a kiss . A dead end . As you can understand , I 'm quite fed up with it all . Just didn 't want to dump Lena . So if you want to get involved with her ... Alright , I won 't object . Makes it easier for me to get out . Alright , I 'll be off . Bye . Hey , maybe you 'll teach a master class ? $ 500 an hour , in Euros . Street violence that erupted in the capital of Bolivia is putting the country on the brink of total chaos . The government forces are trying to take the situation under control , but are suffering heavy losses . Many youth and even children are taking part in the riots . Bolivian media have already called this unexpected bloodshed ... the " child rebellion " . For the moment it is difficult to say ... what exactly had started the violence . But experts are unanimous in their opinion that this outburst of violence ... is connected to the odious insurgent commander Villiermo Mercado . Among all that riff-raff Villiermo turned out to be the most reliable one . I suspected that he might get tempted by the idea of a revolution , but I was hoping that he is not such an idiot . Not good . This is not the most costly mistake . Our investments into this venture were small . Small ? The training of mercenaries cost $ 940,000 ... - Another $ 200 ... - You think ... that I am concerned about the money spent ? That I dream of increasing my rating in Forbes magazine ? There are people , who make millions , and there are people , who change history . Of first kind there are thousands , of second - only a few individuals . And there would be one individual more , if that cretin , who you have chosen , would not exchange the 200 million a year for the laurels of Che Gevara . - I sincerely hope that after I pass away ... - A doctor to the office immediately . When will it end ? Open . Get in touch with the control center . Tomorrow at 23 : 00 we start the refueling procedure . Center , tomorrow at 23 : 00 full refueling . Orders of Sergey Victorovich . We didn 't know how things were going to go with that company . They said to Lebedev that the weapons were sunk in the river . But in reality they hid it with Long 's uncle . Hey ! Who 's there ? I 'll get you , vermins ! Polkan , report to me . All sorts come around . What is with you ? You know , when we were playing , it was just pure drive . We never said " killed . " Rather we said " minused . " At Hazyr 's everything was like in the game . There was no fear , only the devices had changed . Games in real life . The games are over . If minused , there is not another round . One on one I could take down any of them , but there are three of them . Also , the garrison and mercenaries . Let 's report this somewhere ? Hello , FSB ( Federal Security Services ) , my name is Dima . You know , at a secret base ... on an aerostat ... disks are hidden that turn computer gamers into superhero fighters . There is only one use from that phone call , they 'll put me in a nut house , I 'll get out of [ mandatory ] military service . Only I can fix this . But one against all , I won 't be able to do it . I 'm with you . Fire In The Hole ! Checking your vigilance . Idiot . A gift for you . Now do you see that you can trust me ? How did you find us ? Not only Rita knows how to use mIRC . Let 's go get air . - Do you have anything to wake up ? - Want some hot water down your back ? Rita . You were right . Because of these disks we do not see people , we only see frags ... Long was killed , but for Doc and Yan that is just minus one from our side . - They 've gone mad . - And you ? I 've gone mad just like all of us . I can 't do this anymore . Do you want to stop it all ? We 'll stop it together . Mercenaries are off the base , a garrison of guards is left , about 30 people . We can take them down in the barracks . There 's a cannon , machine guns , and a pair of grenade launchers . If we open fire from above , no one will leave the barracks . How do we take control of it ? It 's inside the base . At night 3 guards at the gate , plus one on top of the tower . If battle brakes out , alarm will go off . We won 't take the tower , we 'll get captured , aerostat flies away . Yes . I heard it 'll be refueled at night . If we blow up the control center , they can 't turn off the module . They 'll turn it off manually . But if we hide here , it 's our chance to get inside . - How do we blow up a cement bunker ? - Barracks have radio-control mines . Saw a box of them . But first we must neutralize the garrison from the tower top . How do we quickly destroy security ? Security doesn 't remember Rita . There is an idea , but we 'll need another person . Someone the guards won 't know . Max . He won 't do it . Won 't be able to do it without him . This is really treacherous . Rita , there 'll be 4 guards on post . They probably remember me . Without Max we won 't get close , no other way of convincing him . What if we 're wrong about him , and he goes to kill you ? He 'll join us . Watch ! Dima ! Vampire ! Dima ! - Give me the knife . Knife . - Hide it . - Hello . What are you doing here ? - Hello . - Salute , Max . - Guys , see what 's on this disk . Maxim ! Some people have kidnapped me ! They say that if you don 't kill your friend Vampire , then they will kill me ! I 'm really scared ! Please help ! It didn 't say where to find her . Do you know who this is ? Those criminals you wanted to take down ? No , Max , it 's not them . But I know who . Will you help ? Of course . 30 thousand , as we had agreed . Enough for some shopping . - Nothing will happen to him , right ? - No . Sergey Victorovich . Not even a month has passed , but I understand a lot has happened since we last met . - Let 's do without jokes . - As you wish . Friday , at night . - You will transfer the money to this account . - A true business man . An offer in return . Would you like to act just as beautifully and boldly as us ? There are video files and explanation in here . One disk costs $ 100,000 dollars . One test sample , free of charge . You know , Lebedev , you make a good business partner , we 'll work well together . Black or silver ? I 'm a groom , not a waiter . The silver one , of course . A groom . Don 't ruin the bow tie , I 'll have to return it to the store . Mosquito . - What ? - Don 't get too into the balloons . Max , I need a word . Remember our conversation at the pier after Hazyr 's ? Max , we are going to kill . - I am ready . - You 're hand combat , not a shooter . You can help us get inside , and not get involved from that point on . Dima , I never played as a shooter , but even without your abilities a person can shoot . I will go with you . He 's not hopeless . - Who is coming ? - No one is coming anywhere . I 'm a little lost here , I think . She 's drunk . From where so dressed up ? From Orehovo . What are you drooling over ? Kick her out of here . Have you seen my husband ? Why are you in uniform ? - Where am I ? - Where you shouldn 't be . Turn around and get out of here . Guys ! Where will I go ? But the time I come , it 'll be day . But this is my wedding night . We could help you with that here . I 'll think about it . It 's my Maxim . I am here ! I 'll be back , boys . Guys , is everything okay ? I 'm taking her . Rita , have you gone crazy ? We barely found you . Let 's go home . No ! I want to dance ! Let 's go , they 're on duty . - Dance ! - Guys , we 're leaving . - One dance , and we 'll go . - Only one . - Cover , Rita . - Yes . - Wait for us on the aerostat . - As we agreed . Catch . Security breach ! Grab weapons ! He 's on the staircase ! Now watch out . Take off immediately . You both , follow me to the office . Refueling module ! Take it . These are more reliable . Yan , to the door . Boris Sergeevich , emergency lift-off is not possible , - we are connected to refueling module . - Whose orders ? Lebedev . When can we lift off ? - Which one 's charged ? - Hell knows . Press all . First post , main control center destroyed . Module was not turned off ! Do emergency turn off ! I 'm opening the door , take defense positions . Turn off refueling module . Doc and Yan are in the office . I hacked the system , from here we can lock them in . Now they 're shut in a box . Let 's go . - Where 's Lena ? - Same place as the disks . I 'll open . - There ? - There 's a passage . - Mosquito , what have you done ? - Mosquito , open ! - Mosquito , what 's going on ? - Mosquito ! Roma , open the door ! No connection ! Can you handle it ? Of course , we 'll handle it . Sorry . No time for scopolamine . Tell us the code to the safe , then I 'll give you a pain killer . Hear me ? Hear me ? Give him half or he 'll die . Easy , easy ! Not nice ! Right now I 'll shoot you in the other leg , it 'll be even less nice . Spill the code ! Code to the safe ! Quickly , out with it ! 21-10-69 Last two numbers ! 69 . - That 's it , he 's gone . - Fire In The Hole ! Hello , Mosquito . - Successful ? - 21-10-69 . What if it 's wrong ? Then we 'll never know . Yes ! Doc , go first . Yan , take out the mine . There ! Let 's go . Doc , did we take enough disks ? - If more , it would be a herd instead of a team . - You 're probably right there . - Let 's go say goodbye ? - Doc , no . - Doc ! - Doc ! What do we do now ? Play hide and seek . What a scrape . This is great , right ? I could leave without saying goodbye , but I really wanted you to understand that in tactics I surpassed you . What tactics ? Dimon , have you never thought about how you could 've been so lucky ? Jumping off just a second before the explosion . Go . Finding a life vest . Shall I tell you what happened , while you were lying on the deck unconscious ? Doc , your device . I told you we can 't trust him . We couldn 't have done it without him . Shall I finish him off ? Wait . What you said below deck about the disks is true . If we bring them back there , our worth is 3 pennies . If we don 't bring the disks , we don 't get $ 100 grand . We 'll bring them back , but will keep them only for ourselves . I thought to myself , why work for this man , who can at any moment replace you with someone else ? Wouldn 't it be better to take a little bit of disks , a little bit of money , go somewhere far and start up my own game ? But I was thinking how do I get out with the disks through the security ? I needed someone to attack them from the behind , right ? Who could do that for me ? I only had to give you a direction . Suggest a plan . Mosquito did an A + job in completing that task . By the way , it was he who suggested adding in Max , for extra assurance . Add me in for assurance ? What the hell ? Where 's Lena ? Probably busy spending the money that Rita gave her . Is this true ? It 's true . It 's true . But you don 't have long to grieve about it . Bye . You 're quite the scum , Vampire . From the very beginning I didn 't want to get involved , and because of you . Don 't get hysterical , Max . You used me . Damn , where are they from ? - Back ! - Back where , Doc ? Quickly go up ! Room where Vampire . We 'll leave through a hatch from the other side . Mr. Colonel , someone was here before us . Act according to plan . Destroy the aerostat and base . Bring disks from the safe here . - Doc , will he believe you ? - We 'll make a deal . Vampire and Max , hello again . Two trucks full of special forces outside . In a couple of minutes we 're all finished . Below your feet is an exit , I can open it from here . You throw down the guns and we all leave in peace . Agreed ? - Agreed . - We 'll think about it . What 's there to think , idiot ? Agree now . There 's 40 men out there , they 'll do us in by numbers . You deserve it . Vampire . Listen to me . Enough with the moralizing . Rita and Max are with you , I have the guys . Let 's forget everything we had because they 'll kill or capture us all . Throw down the guns and I open . Leave your guns and disks . Then open the hatch . I will let you out , I promise . - No , I need the disks . - With disks you do not leave . Why so stubborn , Vampire ? To hell with these disks . Max , people die because of them . You can leave , but only without disks ! Max , you have a great friend here , right ? First he lies to you and now doesn 't allow you to leave . We 'll throw the guns , but whether we take disks or not , you don 't care ? - I don 't care . - Then help us . Look , we 're throwing down the guns . Dima , without guns they can 't do us anything . - If anything , I 'll knock them out . - Max , I won 't let them out with disks ! Go to hell ! Who do you think you are ? I have to fix something . I have nothing to fix . You did all this . You got me involved . - I don 't want to die because of you . - Max ! With disks they do not leave . Period . I didn 't want this . - Mosquito , open ! - Max ! Max , no ! We 've got tons of cash . Doc , throw the disks ! Why these games ? Do what he said . I will decide what to throw and what to not throw ! - No one tells me what to do , got it ? - Got it . Dimon . Game over for everybody ? Fantastic . But last round is on me . Right now I will close my door , will keep your door wide open , and will enjoy the sight ... of you and Rita getting massacred . Got it ? - What have you done ? - We have a minute . With him we had no chance . Without the disks Vampire will let us out . Vampire , do you promise ? We throw down the guns and I open the hatch . - Doc 's share is yours . - I have already promised . Come in one by one . - We 'll give the money outside . - I 'm going out the other exit . To the cops ? Max is hurt , I won 't leave him . He betrayed you . I know that . Yan ! Yan ! - Mosquito ! - Throw it down . Good luck . Stop , don 't move ! Weapons down , on your knees ! Down ! Hands behind the head ! Hands behind the head !

 Coulson : Chasing us is a waste of resources , general . May : They 're mercenaries , here for the money . The enemy has the advantage . We need one of our own . You risked that for a quinjet ? For what we can do with one . Disappear . Fitz said he could engineer cloaking , but ... The damage to his temporal lobe was too extensive . Since simmons left , he 's only getting worse , Talking to himself more and more . Coulson : It 's not just an 0-8-4 . It 's the first . And all fury knew about was the trail of bodies that follows it . Aah ! [ tires screeching ] [ breathing heavily ] Hey , idaho . Idaho , can you hear me ? [ grunting ] Come on ! Damn it ! Come on ! [ grunting ] [ motorcycle approaching ] [ breathing heavily ] [ tires screech ] [ sighs ] Creel 's on foot . But he won 't be for long . Hartley and idaho ? Dead . [ metal rattling ] that 's no use . It 's jammed . We have to get you out of here ! My leg is pinned . Don 't worry about me . There 's no time . Creel has the damn thing that burned harley ! You need to get him ! Go ! Good luck . [ motorcycle engine turns over ] [ tires screeching ] Hands on your head ! On your knees ! What the hell was hunter thinking ? He was trying to save hartley ! And you 're absolutely sure ? They 're gone . It was bad , coulson . Two agents down , another captured . This shouldn 't have happened . We got a hit . A stolen-vehicle call up the road from you . Older model red-and-white pickup . May , you 're approaching a civilian area without backup . [ horn blares ] If you see him , do not engage . You copy ? Do you copy ? [ horn blares ] [ tires screeching ] May , that doesn 't sound covert . I 've got him . Closing in . [ engine revs ] No , drop back . Do not engage . I repeat ... do not engage . He 's not looking . I have a shot . Negative ! We can 't just let him go , coulson . Creel isn 't working alone , And I want to know who he answers to . Drop back into surveillance mode now . That 's an order , agent may ! Yes , sir . [ motor whirring ] I still can 't raise hunter or hartley on the comms . Not surprised . Radio silence on the op is protocol . Still , hartley was in pretty bad shape when we left . Or you 'd think we 'd have heard something by now . No need to think the worst Till it shakes your hand and says hello . Is that another one of your grandma 's sayings ? [ chuckles ] fortune cookie . I had some kung pao chicken the other night . Maybe coulson 's heard from them . Coulson : I need to get a complete inventory By the time agent koenig returns ... Food , fuel , and ammo ... understood ? You got the quinjet . Well done . Thank you , sir . Thank you , sir . Any word about hartley ? Not now . Let mack know the jet 's here . I want him reverse-engineering Sooner he does , sooner we get the bus operational again . Roger that . [ beep ] Something else ? The item that messed up hartley 's arm , It had those weird symbols on it , The ones you 've had me researching . The same symbols ? You sure ? Yes . They came up out of the object . It was like hartley triggered something by touching it . What the hell is that thing ? I have no idea . But good work . " good work " ? How about , " holy crap , skye . We got to get on that " ? After a month of combing the planet for these things , We finally got a clue ... Right now , we have more important problems ... A five-alarm fire otherwise known as lance hunter . Is he ... captured . But if he talks , our entire operation 's compromised . We 'll have to burn the base and evacuate . And we just re-tiled the bathrooms . [ tires screech ] Oh , just as I was dropping off to sleep . Thank you very much . Uh ... Excuse me , gents . Can I get a glass of ... [ engine revs ] ... Water ? [ sighs ] [ helicopter blades whirring ] Mr. Hunter , I don 't believe we 've had the pleasure ! Brigadier general glenn talbot . Looks like you need a lift , soldier . So , this is cloaking hardware . Uh-huh . Let 's take a peek under the hood . Fitz would be crushed if he saw this . He 's been working on cloaking since before simmons took off . Still can 't believe she abandoned him like that . But fitz has been clinging to his work like a lifeline , and ... Maybe we shouldn 't tell him . Coulson wants a retro version of this for the bus . He said that no one knows The avionics on this thing like fitz . I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him ? Hey , fitz . Hey , what 's up , man ? How are you ? So that 's the , um ... That 's the ... Cloaking , in all its glory . You know , you weren 't that far off . Check out the transmitter coil . Yeah , to negate the ... the resonant ... the ... The ... the resonant ... ? No , um ... The , uh ... I-it 's okay . Just take your time . Uh , what he 's trying to say is There 's an audio component to cloaking That inverts sound waves , too . Like noise-canceling headphones ? Yeah , same concept . Okay . You think you can give me a hand with this ? Um , u-under the circumstances , uh ... Well , the trick is you would ... N ... The trick ... the trick would be in the meta-materials . Uh , oh ! Yeah , but you 'd have to alter the , um ... Uh ... Yeah , could everyone just stop talking for one second ? No , sorry . Gonna have to go . It 's like sometimes he 's the same old fitz , And other times ... Not . I 'll take your word for it . Meantime , I 'm still gonna need an extra pair of hands . Is everyone back from the mission ? Not everyone . Sierra leone , three years ago . Ring a bell ? How about basra , ' 08 ? Operation panther 's claw ? Come on , lieutenant . Tell me the stories are true . I 'm not a lieutenant anymore , sir . Why is that , son ? Your record ? Five commendations for distinguished service ... Merits for basket weaving , pottery . I 'm just trying to figure out how a guy like you , One of the sas 's finest , Winds up running with a bunch of mouth-breathing mercs . Why does any man do anything , general ? I met a girl . Look , hunter , I think we 're pretty like-minded guys , So let 's don 't waste each other 's time . You know what I 'm after . Guessing it 's not carl creel . Creel 's small-time . Think big fish . Coulson . Coulson . He 's a vigilante ... A zealot who 'll risk anything to further his own agenda . But lucky for you , I 've got a senator With very deep pockets that wants him . So you go ahead . Name your price . You must be joking . I don 't have a sense of humor . And if I don 't give you coulson , what ? I go for a swim ? You should know I 've been helped out of a chopper before , sir . Coulson broke into a secure government facility , He ... he let a psychopath on the loose , Sacrificed the lives of his own men ... your friends . For what ? Hunter , I 'm not here to play bad cop . I shouldn 't have to . I want $ 2 million . Done . And a proper burial . Excuse me ? For hartley . She 's a s.H.I.E.L.D. Agent . She 'll be branded a terrorist after what you said on tv , Probably dumped in a pauper 's grave , Her family wondering what happened to her . They deserve better . She deserves better . I 'll make sure she gets it . Hmm . " keep an eye out for this . " [ knock on door ] I just wanted to report that mack and trip Are working on cloaking , so ... I 'm free if you want me back in the field . That won 't be necessary . May 's still out there . What about hartley and idaho ? They 're not out there , are they ? It was that thing , wasn 't it ? The object . It was creel . Sir , I need to get back out there And help may take him down . No . I 'm a field agent now , and I can handle myself . That 's not what this is about . Then what is it about ? The object ? The symbols ? Because I can 't help if I don 't know what 's going on . If you 'd like to help , Go down to the bunks , pack up hartley 's things . [ sighs ] [ clicks tongue ] okay . I know you 're the boss and you have to Compartmentalize everything , but it 's not healthy . You need to loosen up . Try ... Yoga or something . I tried it , but I 'm ... Really not flexible . But thanks . Fitz : We were so close . If they 'd just given us a little bit more time To calculate the object 's ... Refractive index , yeah . That 's the problem these days ... Everyone needs answers immediately . No one has any patience anymore . Yeah . That we couldn 't crack the cloaking device . Everyone here knows how valuable you are to the team . Well , they avoid me like the plague . They do not . They ... they just have their own problems right now . Oh , yeah . The creel business . In fact , perhaps they need our assistance . If they 're looking for a way to neutralize creel 's ability ... No one has our experience with gifteds . Of course , we can 't just hijack the project from them . That would shatter their confidence . Yeah , no . Do not want to do that . No . Or do we ? Fitz ... Yeah . Yeah , no , no . Stupid , silly idea . I don 't know why I sai ... Hey . Look . There 's a whole packet of research They just left laying about all willy-nilly For anyone to see . It 's creel 's dna results . [ gasps ] interesting . Shall we see what we can do with these ? Yes , we shall , simmons . Yes , we shall . You all good , hon ? Are you still waiting on a friend ? Yeah , I 'm still waiting . All right , then . No hurry . Here , let me clear that . Excuse me . Aah ! I 'm sorry . Think I got a shock . Static electricity or something . Coulson : What 's the status on creel ? He 's been in there for over an hour . Either he 's waiting for a drop Or he 's getting drunk off his ass . Something 's happening , coulson ! I 'm going in ! [ bell jingles ] [ indistinct conversations ] I don 't know what happened ! All she did was touch the guy ! And then he took off . Please ... Help me ! Hang on . [ crying ] [ police radio chatter ] All the woman did was touch his arm . Coulson : We know that creel absorbs The properties of whatever he touches . He must have absorbed the obelisk And its deadly powers . But why hurt a waitress ? I don 't think it was intentional . You 're saying he 's losing control ? He had some control issues When s.H.I.E.L.D. First came across him . If that 's what 's happening , anyone near him is at risk . Should have engaged when I had the chance . Then you 'd be dead , too . If this is on anyone ... Just because you 're director , doesn 't mean Everything 's on you , phil . Yes . It does . Go dark . Get back when you can . [ alarm beeping ] Now what ? [ sighs ] [ air hisses ] [ sighs ] Nice ride . Some rich guy loan it to you ? Yeah , something like that . Shame about the rims , though , eh ? Yeah . Probably cost a grand each . At least . Mm . This isn 't a friendly stop , is it ? Nope . Hands on the car . How the hell did you lose him ? ! Why haven 't you got every agent out there He killed two of my friends . I think that 's entitlement enough . You should have aborted the mission . Hartley should have followed my orders . [ sighs ] Yeah , well , she tried to . Izzy 's only mistake was listening to me . Is that why you came back ? Guilt ? A desire for revenge ? Or was it because of what talbot promised you ? All of the above . I have 48 hours to deliver you . Or else you 're a dead man . Words to that effect , yeah . Talbot . And you didn 't give him our location ? Don 't get me wrong . I thought about it . He put a four-man detail on me . Took three hours to shake them . I could have led them right to your door . So kind of you to reconsider . And in exchange for me , you get what , exactly ? A proper burial for isabelle hartley . I wanted to make sure her record was cleared , That her family were properly notified . Really ? That 's all ? Look , between you and talbot , I know you 'll get to creel first . He 's the only thing I want . Well , that and the money you owe me . You 're kidding , right ? 'cause sometimes I can 't tell . No , I 'm not . I want my pay , and not just mine , either . I want hartley 's and idaho 's , too . Okay . Now you 're kidding . I think they deserve something for their loss . Don 't you think ? [ sighs ] I 'll take care of it . Good . Once we have creel ... I 'll be in the wind . Or three sheets to it . [ door opens , closes ] Fitz : Why are they going the biochemical route ? Using an adenovirus factor to counter creel 's ability . Yeah , well , it 's pointless , really , Since the injected , um ... Injected vector will never bind to his cellular membranes . Yeah , so ... well , then they 'd have to find A way to destabilize ... The molecular structure of creel 's epidermal cells , yeah . Destabilize . Oh . I d ... I didn 't solve this today . Who you talking to ? Me . What ? No one . You like talking to yourself . That 's cool . You know , I like singing in the shower . Yeah , I know it 's not really the same thing , But I wouldn 't want anyone to hear it . [ both laugh ] What do you want ? All right , for cloaking , were you thinking about Putting it under avionics or ... ? Enough about cloaking . I 'm busy ... With ... Something . Well , it sounds like you 're just blowing me off . You want to be alone ? That 's cool . You know , I think I like him . He 's honest . Blunt , I 'd say . No , he doesn 't talk to you like the others . It 's quite refreshing , actually . Yo . Fitz . [ fingers snap ] Your mind go wandering again ? What ? See ? No . No ... this ... this is just , uh ... Go ahead and show him . What harm would it do ? Does it have something to do with stopping creel ? Yeah . I think ... I think that we are ... I-I ... Have ... I ... I didn 't solve this today . You think you can ? Izzy 's sister , jane . Her favorite person in the world . After me , of course . Looks like they liked each other . Yeah , those two , when they got together , There was a lot of laughs . Izzy was good when it came to family . Which is why I 'm taking this . It belonged to her mum . Died of breast cancer about five years back . Jane has it now , too . That 's awful . Yeah . Life can be a mean drunk that way . Never knows when to stop punching . How did you guys meet ? Through my psychotic ex-wife . Those two were good friends back in the day . I 'm really sorry . Tough to lose people you care about . Secret to that ? Don 't get attached . Tried that . Didn 't work . For you , either . [ chuckles ] You know , you remind me a bit of izzy . Raw but sharp . You got skills . Mm . Type that could earn you some real money As a mercenary ? Yeah , I don 't think so . We prefer the term " private military contractors . " Don 't knock it . Everyone needs an exit strategy eventually . Not me . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s my life now . S.H.I.E.L.D. Isn 't a life . It 's just a job ... a means to an end . Remember that . You hear anything more about creel , let me know . [ breathing heavily ] [ cellphone ringing ] [ ringing continues ] [ cellphone beeps ] Who 's this ? Bakshi : Good evening , mr . Creel . We 've been trying to reach you . I waited at the drop site for an hour . Calm down , mr . Creel . There 's no need to panic . We 're being cautious now that s.H.I.E.L.D. Is a factor . Forget them . I got a real problem . That thing really messed me up . I turned to rubber when I touched it . Thought that it would protect me , But it infected me , too . We 're well aware of your condition . That mr . Whitehall wouldn 't have selected you for this job If you weren 't capable of completing it . You don 't know what it 's doing to me . Once we have the obelisk , you will be taken care of The way hydra has always taken care of you . Please proceed to the secondary drop site , And I shall meet you at the appropriate time . Good night . [ cellphone beeps ] Hello ? ! [ clattering ] What ? ! What are you looking at ? ! Leave them alone , mr . Creel . We have far more important things to discuss . I know you from somewhere ? My name is raina , And I 'm a huge admirer of yours ... And your gifts . Beat it , lady . I 'm not into groupies . You misunderstand . I know you recently acquired Something extremely precious and rare ... Something I 'm very interested in . Whatever you 're offering ... It ain 't enough . Maybe not . But aren 't you the least bit curious As to what it might be ? It 's called carbyne , An allotrope of carbon found in stardust , Three times harder than diamond ... With an added bonus . It can store energy . Beautiful , isn 't it ? [ chuckles ] So filled with potential . Am I supposed to be impressed ? I 'll settle for interested . You have no idea who you 're dealing with , lady . You ever hear of hydra ? Name rings a bell . Let me give you a tip ... run . 'cause if the guy I 'm working for gets ahold of you , I 'd hate to see what he 's gonna do To that pretty little face of yours . Looks like you need some help there , mr . Creel . I 'm not the one who needs help , lady . I 'll tell you what ... I 'm gonna do you a solid And not tell my boss about you ! What about the carbyne ? It 's the cost of doing business . [ door closes ] may : He couldn 't have gone far . Local authorities have his description . Talbot 's people are still out there . Why was creel at the bar ? We just don 't know if that person ever showed . We need a solve for creel 's powers . And we need it yesterday . How 's the lab coming ? You remember that encrypted hydra frequency we shut down ? Well , it 's back up . Someone sent a message . A message for us with a phone number to call . Creel ? A phone number ? What , is he lonely ? And he can turn any body part into any material . Okay . Thank you for that . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Call the number . Okay . [ ringing ] Raina : Hello ? Agent coulson , I 'm glad you got my message . Raina , as I live and breathe . It 's been a while since we 've spoken . I 'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt . Can we make this quick ? Why ? You need time to trace this call , don 't you ? I take it , then , You haven 't tracked down mr . Creel or the item he stole . What do you know about that ? I know hydra 's about to get their hands on it . Well , congratulations . Let me be clear . Mr. Creel is working for hydra . I am not . Why the breakup ? Bad dental plan ? Hydra only has one thing on their minds ... World domination ... Which is so 1945 . What do you want , raina ? It 's what I don 't want , Which is the obelisk falling into the hands Of people who don 't understand it . I 'm thinking you might . And I 'm thinking you 're gonna tell me why . John garrett understood it . The moment he was injected With the same drug that saved you , He had visions . He started carving those visions on the walls . Garrett was a madman . Garrett was enlightened . He witnessed our fate ... What we 'd become . Have you ? You 're not calling to talk about fate . You want us to catch creel . You read my mind , agent coulson . Truth is mr . Creel stole something from me . Fortunately for the both of us , it has an embedded tracker . But you 'd better hurry . He 's growing less stable by the second . The second that frequency comes through , I want everyone on the move . If creel 's handing off the item to hydra , We need to see where that leads . The lab hasn 't figured out how to shut down his powers yet . If he 's an immediate threat to civilians , Trip 's got the backup plan . What kind of backup plan ? The heavy-duty kind with armor-piercing rounds . Get close enough to him , catch him off guard ... Hopefully , we won 't have to find out . Where do you want me ? That depends . Can you follow an order ? Because part of me wants you here running back-end . The other part knows we need boots on the ground , And I 've only got a few good pairs . I 'll be good . Scout 's honor . Please , sir . I owe hartley one . We could use him . Suit up . It 's all about the ... The resonant . [ sighs ] I didn 't solve this today . What ... what ... what ... what is this ? What , is this some kind of sonic thing , Like the cloaking device ? No , I didn 't , uh ... Look , forget about the cloaking device , all right ? Right now we just got to focus on taking down creel . Whoa ! Whoa ! Calm the hell down ! Hey , beat it ! You 're pissing him off . Okay . Take it easy . Look , I didn 't solve this today ! Yeah , I know . You said that already ! I didn 't solve this today ! Wait . Are you saying you didn 't solve this today . You solved this before ? Yes . Y-you 're looking for an old design ? Yes ! Yeah . Yeah . All right . Okay . All right . I 'm with you . Yeah . I 'm with you , turbo . All right . No . No . No . Um ... Go back one . Go back one . Yeah . Yeah ! Icers ? Great . How did we get stuck with a nonlethal option ? Coin flip . Trip called tails . Just getting word from the lab . Fitz might have something we can use To neutralize creel 's power . Best news we 've had all day . Raina 's tracker just popped . Creel 's here . Trip , are you in position ? Locked , loaded , and looking ... Found him . He 's got the package . Looks like creel is talking to the guy with his back to him . That 's his hydra contact . The deal 's going down . Skye ? Running facial recognition now . Let 's put a name to that face . Let the exchange happen . Skye and hunter , follow the new player . May , stay with creel . [ gun cocks ] everyone copy ? Copy that . Copy . Copy that , sir . Wonder why creel hasn 't made the exchange yet . Can we get a laser mike on him ? Skye , you copy ? Skye ? [ gun cocks ] Oh , hell no . [ grunts ] You 're not listening . It 's spreading all over . I can barely contain it . Pass me the case and I 'll help you . Help me , and I won 't do to you what I did to the waitress . Calm down , mr . Creel . Take a deep breath and clear your mind . Remember your training . Remember , compliance will be rewarded . I 'm happy to comply . Good . Very good . Whoa ! Man : He 's got a gun ! Oh , my god ! [ women screaming ] [ metal clangs ] [ indistinct shouting ] Everybody out ! Move ! I 'm not gonna sugarcoat it , pal . This is really gonna hurt . [ energy crackling ] Coulson : " scout 's honor " ? You were never a boy scout , were you ? Soldier : Present ! Huh ! Order ! Huh ! [ beep ] Breaking into cars now ? [ sighs ] Following up on a promise . Thanks to you . General talbot 's not the only one with friends , Though I am sorry about that $ 2 million you wanted . That I can 't swing . Oh , you knew about that , too , eh ? I 'm the director of s.H.I.E.L.D. Well , that 's just marvelous . Talbot wants me dead . And now I have no funds to run with . Any tips ? Yeah . Don 't run . Work for me instead . Creel must have hit you in the head . I shot three of your agents . Including agent may . [ chuckling ] not a smart move . She the type that holds a grudge ? Savors it , actually . No doubt , you 've made some mistakes . So have I , like letting you go after creel . But I felt for you . Yeah , and I took advantage of that . How do you know I won 't do it again ? I don 't , but the reality is I don 't have a fleet of helicarriers or quinjets Or thousands of agents at my disposal anymore . We 're lucky we still have our george foreman grill . You need warm bodies . Is that it ? I need skilled assets in the field Who are willing to step over the line , To do the wrong thing but for the right reason . I need you because I can 't be you . Yeah , well , you 're better off . Trust me . Look , it 's your choice . But good people ... People I respect ... Vouched for you . I 'd like to find out why . Hell if I know . But I 'm curious . Good enough . Oh . I just need you to do one thing . Oh , yeah ? Sell me out . The sound waves disrupted the molecular , um ... The molecular ... the , um ... Well , you should understand . You modified it . You know how some guys can play a tune by ear ? Well , I need sheet music . [ chuckles ] The original one ... You built this with this agent simmons I keep hearing about ? Yeah . What about simmons ? Oh , no , no . I heard that she was cool . Heard that you two were pretty tight . Yeah . It 's tough to lose a good partner . How you been holding up since she left ? I 'm okay . I 'm glad he 's talking to someone . I 've got to admit , I 'm having a tough time with it . May : It 's understandable . He 's changed . We all have . Even the director . Coulson has a lot on his plate , rebuilding s.H.I.E.L.D. I wouldn 't know . He 's not exactly the sharing type these days . He has the world to worry about , Not just us , not just the team . That 's not it , may . I 've been watching him for months , And I know he 's keeping something from me , And it 's not just because he 's the director of s.H.I.E.L.D. I think something is wrong with him . Skye ... No , may , be honest . Is coulson okay ? Of course . May : What is wrong with you ? You 're director now , not some level 1 field agent . There are no levels anymore . I got rid of those . You never should have gone into the field like that . You 're welcome . It 's not funny , phil . I know you . And I know when you 're overly stressed . It 's been 18 days since your last episode . 17 . 18 . Which means you 're due or another one . Overdue . And I 'm tired of fighting it . So don 't . That 's why I 'm here . [ sighs ] [ camera shutter clicks ] You did well . Thank you . I ... Now ... Pick it up . You ... You want me ... I need to know . So do you . Pick it up . [ gasps ] [ exhales sharply ] It worked . No . It let you live . There 's a difference . Show me . Please . Bring me my daughter , And I 'll show the both of you . We 'll return in a moment . Glenn . Can I call you " glenn " ? No . Where 's hunter ? Watching " cake boss , " I believe . Sorry . I changed the terms of your deal . Well , he kept up his end . You 're here . Question is why ? I felt bad for kidnapping you , So I brought you a peace offering . Carl creel . I thought creel was dead . He 's turned to stone , but he could always do that , So I 'm not sure how long it 'll hold . I 've got him in a cryostasis chamber In the back of the van for 58 more minutes Before the juice runs out . I 'd get him someplace secure pretty quick . Maybe a little more secure than last time . Just saying . Very generous of you . Like I told you before , general , we 're the good guys . So , how about we make a deal ? S.H.I.E.L.D. Will keep dropping off presents like this , You keep getting promoted . All we ask for in return is a little breathing room . Sound good ? [ chuckles ] you ... You must have some big brass ones , coulson . Coming out here by yourself to meet me ... Face-to-face , no backup . [ grunts ] let 's face facts . You and your little band of misfits are hardly s.H.I.E.L.D. Our intel says you don 't have enough manpower or artillery To take down a convenience store , so I 'm sorry . I 'm gonna have to say no to that deal . I don 't know . I think we 're good on artillery . And in case you get any ideas , general ... That 's just the tip of the iceberg . Let 's get out of here before the iceberg runs out of fuel .

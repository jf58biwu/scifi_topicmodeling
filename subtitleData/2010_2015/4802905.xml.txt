 Previously on Touch ... MARTIN : You had to call the police , right ? MAN : This is the third time this month . Hey , don 't go near him ! You can 't touch him . ARTHUR : The numbers your son gives you , Mr. Bohm , aren 't new . They 've always existed . He found the Amelia Sequence . Amelia was obsessed with tides . She came up with this equation based on global tidal patterns , and she was fixated on this certain sequence of numbers . God will allow humankind to exist as long as there are 36 righteous people in the world . They walk among us , blessed with the capacity to feel the suffering of the entire human race . - Do you think Jake is one of these 36 ? - Yes . Teller was working with a girl who was just like Jake . Her name was Amelia . When they wanted her , they faked her death and made her disappear . I 'm not letting that happen to my son . Jake ! We have to get out of town unseen . Go ! The farther away , the better . JAKE : There are infinite ways to communicate , some better than others . Today , the average person will say 17,520 words to 7.4 other individuals . Yet change the language , one border to the next , and we are hopeless . Stumbling to explain the simplest of concepts . I want ... I am ... I love . Well , this is it , buddy . Can 't go any farther west than this . Still not exactly sure what we 're doing here . What is it ? Excuse me . Is this yours ? Oh , yes . - Thank you so much . - Yeah . It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? I 've never been to this part - of the country before . - Yeah . What brought you out here ? Um , looking for my daughter . What 's your daughter 's name ? Amelia . Amelia . My name is Jake . I was born on October 26 , 2000 . I 've been alive for 11 years , eight months and 16 days . And in all that time , I 've never said a single word . ( chuckles , sighs ) But that 's about to change . Oh , my God . That 's her . That 's Amelia . When was this taken ? A few weeks ago . A board-and-care facility in New York . My son was there at the same time . He led me to you to try and help you - find your daughter . - All this time , and it was some company ? Aster Corps . They brought your daughter to the facility after they staged her death . Why ? Why would they do that ? I don 't know . At least not yet . They 're after my son for the same reasons . He 's like your daughter . He sees patterns , connections . Everything seems to revolve around these numbers . Jake 's been obsessed with a sequence , 3-1-8 , 5-2 ... 9-6-3-2-8-7-9-5 . The Amelia Sequence . That 's what Dr. Teller called it . I have been following these numbers for three years . That 's what led me here to Los Angeles . - Okay , this map ... - Yes ? I saw this map four days ago in New York City . Then I 'm going there . - I 'm going there right now . Right now ! - No , wait , wait , wait . We came out here for a reason . We think ... He never does this . Not for strangers . Wait . They 're the next two numbers , see ? 2 , 4 ... 2 , 4 ... I-I don 't understand what he 's trying to say . The second number is four . Look , the letter D. 2-D . They 're coordinates . Near Hobart and Western . - That 's about ten miles from here . - Wait , wait . Please tell me the truth . Is everything that you 're saying really true ? Yes . So , how 's this work ? It 's different every time . So , what , we just follow him ? Welcome to my world . Hey , is this it ? Look at the sign . " 2D . " - 2D . 2D ! - Wait , wait ! I think we need some kind of a plan . Like what ? I don 't know . Just let me do the talking . MAN : I hung the sign out for a reason ! Uh , excuse me . We 're not housekeeping . We 're ... we 're looking for someone . - Hi . What 's going on ? - Hi . Sorry to bother you . We 're looking for a young girl . - She 's about ... - She 's my daughter . Her name 's Amelia . She 's 14 years old . She has sandy blonde hair . I 'm sorry . I don 't know who that is . Okay , thank you for your trouble . Sorry to bother you . - Let 's go . - Good luck to you . - Wait . GIRL : - Help ! Hey , hey ! Amelia ! - Back up . - Amelia ! Amelia ! Amelia ! Amelia ! Amelia ! ( grunts ) Amelia ! Stop right there . Who are you ? What are you doing here ? Where is she ? Look , I swear , I 'll shoot . Don 't come ... I swear I 'll shoot ! Where is my daughter ? ! I was just hired to find her ! ( Martin groaning ) - You all right ? - Yeah . Go ! - Go , go ! Get her ! - Jake , get inside . ( tires squeal ) He got away . No , no ... She was here . It was her . I know . - You all right ? - Yeah . We got to call the police and tell them everything . - With what ? We don 't have any evidence . - Well , we have a videotape . Yeah , with no time stamp , no date . The image is so poor , you barely recognize your own daughter . They 'll rip it to shreds . It was Amelia . I saw her with my own eyes ! They will say you saw what you wanted to see . Look at me . I need you to hear me now . The people that we are dealing with are ruthless . I had evidence that Aster Corps faked your daughter 's death . They had a man following me . He knocked me out and took it back , and then he tried to kill me . When I went to the police to tell them , the people from Aster Corps made me sound crazy . I am not crazy ! And neither are you . Right now , the only evidence that 's going to matter is finding your daughter alive . And if we move too fast , if we push these people , we scare them , they will kill her . Do you understand me ? It 's that simple . They will kill her . So we cannot go to the police . Okay . So , what do we do now ? We start from scratch . I got the guy 's license plate number as he was driving off . We just have to figure out how to trace it . But how do we do that ? I know a guy here . An old friend . He works for the LA Times . He owes me a favor . We were correspondents together . You 're a journalist ? Was . A lifetime ago . Jake ? Jake ? Hey . I 'm sorry that happened . Look , I know you wanted us to come out here and find Lucy , but ... I don 't know where that 's gonna lead us . And sometimes ... something scary might happen , like today . But I need you to know that I will never let anything bad happen to you . Okay ? ( chuckles softly ) MAN : At Aster Corps , we don 't just wait for the future to happen , we think about it every day- - when we create the energy that powers the world , when we ship our products to the four corners of the globe . And it 's crucial you underscore that profits are up dramatically . Our new initiatives are successful , dynamic , game-changers . It 'll all be on the teleprompter , same as always . Corporate says it 's verbatim the draft they e-mailed you . Now , as far as wardrobe goes , I need that decision . Uh , either works with the backdrop . If it were me , I might ... Uh , Mr. Norburg ? Go with this . MAN : Bonjour , monsieur . Pardonnez-moi . _ _ Do you speak English ? Yes , a little . What brings you to Brussels ? Are you a tourist ? I 'm on a mission , of sorts . I 'm looking for someone . Have you heard of the composer Frederick LeMay ? No , monsieur . I 'm sorry . He wrote an amazing piece a few years ago . A violin concerto in F major . Some say it 's like hearing the voice of angels . But he never wrote another . Maybe he didn 't want to . It was not for him to decide . That 's beautiful . On the necklace there . The Tree of Life . Perfection of the universe . Each of us has his own path to God . Destiny . Preordained . It 's a mortal sin to deny it . Like your friend no longer composing music . He 's not my friend . Anything else , monsieur ? How tall are you ? I 'm sorry , monsieur ? I said , " How tall are you ? " Almost two meters . Thank you . You seen Calvin ? One of these days , you 're gonna run out of places to hide , mate . It 's okay , I talked to them . You can wear your hoodie for the speech today . The board actually thinks it sells the image- - genius , iconoclast . Calvin ? Calvin ? I can 't do it . It 's just one speech out of about eight others they 're gonna hear today . It 's not that big of a deal . I 'm not talking about the speech . Well , you 're certainly not talking about the algorithm project , because it would be unthinkable for you to derail it at this point . So let 's talk about the speech , please . Aster Corps premier shareholders want to hear from the guy with the Midas touch . In turn , they will continue to fund our efforts . It 's worth quite a lot of money . We promised each other it was never gonna be about the money . Wait , we sold our company to Aster Corps for $ 42 million . It was always about the money . We were gonna change the world . We have . No , we haven 't ! All we 've done is gotten rich . Rightfully so . Mate , your algorithms reinvented Aster Corps ' entire customer-facing business . It made them $ 40 billion . All from your weird little chicken scratch here . Look , when are you gonna tell me what this is really about ? We 've been best mates since freshman year at college . I know you , Calvin ; something 's up . It repeats . What ? The sequence that I 've been working on . It 's gonna wrap around back to the beginning , back to 3-1-8 , eventually , I know it . And ? This is the God sequence . It 's gonna change humanity forever . That 's why I can 't let Aster Corps have it . Sorry , humanity . - That 's what we 're talking about now , is it ? - It 's not funny . I don 't get it . What is it you want , Calvin ? I want to get out of my contract , Tony . I need you to get me out of my contract . You 're my friend . Please , I can 't do this . I 'm dying here . Okay . Okay , we 'll ... we 'll talk to the legal team . We 'll figure it out , mate . Come on , we 'll figure it out . MARTIN : Trevor , this is my son , Jake . - And this is ... - Oh , Lucy . - Hi . How are you ? - Hi . Trevor , Trevor Wilcox . So , I 'm going to take a wild guess that this is not the LA Times . It 's called BreakWire . It 's a web-based , user-generated news organization . A billion smartphones in the world , everyone with an internet connection and a camera . That 's a billion potential reporters out there . I knew I got out of the business at the right time . Um , ( clears throat ) would you mind if Jake and I went and raided your refrigerator ? He 's probably a little hungry by now . Oh , no , make yourself at home . Uh , kitchen 's just around the corner there . Thanks . So , we were able - to track the plate . - Great . Uh , Santiago here has been on it . He 's our resident nerd promoted to hacker . Reuben , Reuben Santiago . Martin B ... Bishop . Don 't ask . All right , so turns out the car is registered to a private detective who works out of a PO box in the Valley . Now , his e-mail is secure , but I backdoored into his bank account and his appointment book . He deposited 15 grand in cash into his checking account four days ago . Same day , he has an appointment with Larry Pearl , senior partner at Lesser , Rasmussen Howe , law firm , Century City . Any of this adding up to you ? No . Can you run a check on the firm 's primary clients ? Yeah . Looks like their big account is with ... Aster Corps . ( sighs ) TREVOR : Aster Corps ? That help ? Yeah , that helps .

But I am not in your way . No , no , my friend . You are in His way . You 're an aberration , a blasphemy in the eyes of the Father . I 'm sorry ? It 's not your fault . Would you take a small step forward , please ? ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . I 'm a little bit nervous . Why ? I 'm still not used to this . _ ( gasps ) You want to play those ? Go ahead . I 'm sure they won 't mind . - Hey . - Hey . So , it looks like our guy was a private detective . He was hired by a lawyer who works for a firm whose primary client is Aster Corps . Reuben , their IT guy , gave me this ; it 's a flash drive with a sniffer program . It 'll allow me to remotely access someone else 's computer . All I have to do is sneak into this lawyer 's office and download it to his desktop . ( exhales ) Great , but how are you gonna get into the office ?

Hired a private detective just to make sure you were all right . And we thought it all had something to do with us . Hey , honey , does your mom know where you are ? You need to call her . You need to go home . I can 't . How could she lie to me all those years ? Sweetheart , I think she was just trying to protect you . Listen , as a mom myself , I know what it is to lose a daughter .

( applause ) Aster Corps has seen record increases in profits this year . Together , we 've redefined distribution , predicted consumer behavior and more than tripled our stock price projections . All through the use of state-of-the-art algorithms developed by me and my team . ( applause ) At least that 's what it says here on the teleprompter . ( laughter ) The truth is , Aster Corps is using these same algorithms to program machines to be more intelligent than any of us . These machines will in turn create new machines more intelligent than them , and so on and so on , until the very idea of being human , the very brain inside each of us , will become obsolete . Driven by profits and corporate greed , it 's a dystopian nightmare in the making . Brought to you by our good friends here at Aster Corps .

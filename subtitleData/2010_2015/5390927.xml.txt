 julia : Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible and completely inescapable . We 're trapped . julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . jim : Dale Barbara stands accused of the attempted murder of Julia Shumway . And for the murders of Maxine and Agatha Seagrave . I am not turning our town into a police state just because you say so . jim : It 's not me , Linda . It 's the people . MAN [ OVER radio ] : Sir , the ranking official is a James Rennie . One drone caught surveillance of Rennie murdering the reverend at the bridge roadblock . That dome can 't come down . Not now . You 're a sick bastard . Everyone 's gonna smile when you die . phil : Why 'd he do it ? - Barbie won 't get away with it . jim : To the charges brought against you , how do you plead ? Not guilty . NORRlE : It 's the pink stars . - What does it mean ? JOE : The egg . We think it 's the source that powers the whole dome . angle : Do you trust your dad ? - Of course I do . You didn 't always . We all saw the same vision at the dome , Junior . NORRlE : When the butterfly hatches - JOE : The monarch will be crowned . Hey , bud . We 've been waiting on you . - It 's really happening . - What 's happening ? - Move away . - Linda . Back away . How long have you guys known about this ? - What about you ? - Just a couple days . But , Linda , don 't do anything rash . The kids , they think the egg is the source . Source of what ? The dome . - It 's the generator of the dome . NORRlE : We can sort of talk to it . It told us the monarch will be crowned . - What is that supposed to mean ? JOE : We don 't know yet . But that 's a monarch butterfly . We think it 's gotta be important , so we have to get it out of there before it hurts itself . - Or worse . - I know how it all sounds . But I believe them . Not guilty ? What are you , insane ? - You think this is some sort of game ? - Unh . You 're the one rolling the dice here , because Julia 's still out there somewhere . - And she knows the truth . - I already told people the truth . You killed Max , her mother and her bodyguard . Nobody can change that now . We 'll see . You entered your plea . Now you get your justice . [ inaudible dialogue ] Tell me ! Why do you want me to kill my father ? - Unh . angle : Hey , take it easy , Julia . I appreciate everything that you 've done , - but I can 't hide out down here . - You are not safe out in the open . I 'm the only one who can exonerate Barbie . Which is why Big Jim will have you killed long before you can tell anyone . Then I 'll die trying . Angie , please . You don 't have to come with me , but you can 't stand in my way . [ GRUNTS ] You don 't know anything about this . It could be radioactive . The big dome isn 't . Well , this doesn 't belong to you . As of now , this is police property . What the hell ? You didn 't think I was just gonna roll over , did you ? - Make this easy for you ? - No , nothing with you is easy . I know you 're just gonna screw me in the end . You don 't know any other way . At least I can take you down with me . [ CHUCKLES ] I don 't think you understand what 's happening here . I could end this right now with a bullet in your head . Oh , yeah . You can . But you won 't . You won 't , because there 's no audience here . The butterfly hits the dome . And makes some kind of spot . Oh , my God . JOE : We 've gotta do something . BEN : Guys ? Is it just me or is it getting crazy dark outside ? barbie : This isn 't just about killing me . This is about making sure this entire town knows that you are judge , jury and executioner . [ CROWD chattering outside ] WOMAN 1 : Get the kids inside . WOMAN 2 : Oh , no ! MAN 1 : Right over there . MAN 2 : What the hell ? WOMAN 3 : It 's all right , honey . MAN 3 : Stay calm . MAN 4 : What 's causing it ? WOMAN 4 : Hurry ! MAN 5 : The whole thing 's going black . What the hell ? What are you trying to tell - ? This is seriously weirding me out . It 's the middle of the day , but it looks like it 's midnight out there . There 's no moon . No stars . JOE : It 's dying , Norrie . - See , the dome 's trying to talk to us . - Maybe it 's some kind of warning . The dome 's telling us we have to get the butterfly out of there before it dies . - But we need the others . - All right , I 've heard enough . - All available units ? - Don 't do this . All available units to Ben Drake 's house . CAROLYN : Listen to them . Please . I found another dome . [ OVER radio ] And some sort of egg . We 're in trouble . Linda , it 's the dome . It 's all black . I know , Junior . Just get your ass over here . All right , I 'm impounding this thing until we see what happens . - Linda , you found it ? - Jim , you need to see this . Ten-four , I 'm on my way too . [ siren wailing ] [ ringing ] - Make it stop . NORRlE : We don 't know how . Yeah , we kind of do . Remember ? Oh , yeah . That time we touched it . No , I told you . This is police property now . If anybody 's gonna touch it , it 's gonna be me . - We have to get to that egg . - And we will . - After we help Barbie . - No , it can 't wait , Julia . If Linda takes the mini-dome and it ends up in the wrong hands - Barbie needs my help . Our help . This might be our only shot to save his life . Are you with me ? - She 'll be fine . JOE : It was the only way . So now what ? - What did you guys do ? CAROLYN : She touched the dome . She got zapped . Like Dodee . - The monarch is dying , Junior . - We need Angie . - Screw Angie . - What ? She ran off with Julia . Julia was under police protection . - My protection . - She did what she had to do . - By helping Barbie ? He shot Julia . - No , I saw him save her life . Things are happening , Junior . Things bigger than us . - It 's not always about you . BEN : Guys ! It 's Big Jim . He 's almost here . NORRlE : Mom , you have to get out of here . You too , Ben . This is on us . - All three of us . Right , Junior ? NORRlE : Or do you want your dad to lock that thing away before it can give us any answers ? [ sighs ] Let 's go . I guess everyone is out dealing with the blackout . Permanent darkness has its bright side . Okay , the cells are down there . I 'll get the keys . [ DOOR OPENS ] Oh , my God , how are you even standing ? I don 't know . But something out there really wanted me back on my feet . All right , that 's enough , lovebirds . It 's go time . - Linda ! Linda ! linda : Jim . - Jim . - Linda , you okay ? What happened ? Where is it ? I don 't know . But the egg , unh , they think it 's the generator . That it might be able to bring the whole dome down . Jim , we have to find it . This could be our best shot of getting out of here . NORRlE : Now all we have to do is get Angie . We don 't even know where she is . - I know how to find her . - You do ? She has a police radio . She stole one . - We could send her a message . - For the entire force to hear ? What can we even say ? Oh , hell , no . [ GRUNTlNG ] MAN : Don 't . - No handcuff keys . barbie : Forget it . Let 's get out of here . julia : You lose something ? Hold on to those for me , will you ? JOE [ OVER radio ] : Angie . Angie McAlister . Angie , if you can hear me , look , we 're on the move with the mini-dome . Remember where we went to hide when we broke Mom 's old mirror ? Meet us there . This is never gonna work . Trust me , Angie would never forget about the time we hid in the cement factory . No , I mean that thing in there is probably already dead . angle : Joe ! JOE : Thank God . junior : Don 't take another step . angle : Stop . No , this guy 's a psychopath . James , I don 't know what your father told you , but Barbie didn 't shoot me . A woman named Maxine did . Maxine . My dad 's friend ? barbie : Hey . Is that supposed to do that ? We have no idea where Joe and Angie are meeting . There 's only so many places to hide . We 'll start with the McAlisters ' old barn . phil [ OVER radio ] : Linda , you there ? I 'm sorry . - Phil , are you all right ? - Yeah , but Barbie got away . What ? He 's with Julia . She helped him escape . Phil , stay put . I 'm on my way . NORRlE : We ready ? angle : On three . One . Two . Three . JOE : Whoa . It opened up . angle : Oh , God . NORRlE : We 're too late . angle : It 's dead . No . Look . Okay , is somebody gonna tell me what the hell 's going on here ? I knew it . You 're the monarch . Andrea . What 's going on ? Everyone 's getting right with the Lord before the end times . Hey , listen , I know people are scared , but this is a crisis , not the damn apocalypse . And I beheld the sixth seal and , lo , the sun became black as sackcloth . Andrea , listen . It 's all happening just like Revelations said it would . [ ALL praying ] Thank you , everybody , for coming . I know there 's been a bit of a hole in our spiritual community since the passing of Reverend Coggins , [ ALL MURMURlNG ] jim : but I 'm here to tell you the good Lord has not forgotten about Chester 's Mill . FARMER : How can you say that ? We used to be trapped , but at least I could still grow my crops . [ ALL MURMURlNG ] Without sunlight , we all starve . If we don 't freeze to death first . What if the temperature starts dropping ? My family is already out of propane . Listen , I give you my word , nothing like that 's gonna happen . How do you know that ? [ CROWD murmuring ] I don 't . But I have faith . I have faith in us . I have faith in God . I have faith that he would never ask more of us than we can handle . Good book says light is sown for the righteous . Well , there 's been too much evil and too much lawlessness since that dome came down . WOMAN 1 : Yes . MAN : We 're behind you . jim : That 's about to change . And when it does , you trust me , Chester 's Mill will have its new dawn . WOMAN 2 : Amen . WOMAN 3 : Amen . No way . I refuse to believe he 's the monarch . But this has to be the way the dome picks a new leader . - What , by using insects ? NORRlE : Uh-oh . - What now ? - The egg . It 's doing something . Is it gonna hatch ? It looks more like it 's gonna explode . - What is this ? - What do we do ? - We get the hell away from that thing . barbie : He 's right . Let 's go . - Wait . barbie : No , Julia , the whole place is about to come down on us . Let 's go . Julia , don 't touch it ! It 's dangerous ! Why did the shaking stop ? She 's your monarch . - Councilman Rennie . - Oh , thanks for coming , Phil . Listen , I need you to put together a work detail . - Find as many carpenters as you can . - What is it ? It 's an idea that came to me at church . My great-grandfather built the last one that was in Chester 's Mill . Are you serious ? This town is on the brink of chaos , son . If we wanna maintain the peace , we need to show everyone exactly how serious we are about law and order . phil : All right . For Dodee . Yes . For Dodee . Jim , you there ? Yeah , go ahead , Linda . I 'm at Joe 's , but there 's nothing here . You sure ? Any clues to where they may have gone ? Not really . Looks like they were using this barn as some weird art project . What the hell does " The pink stars are falling in lines " mean ? What did you say ? The pink stars are falling in lines . Why ? That mean something to you ? Not for a long time . Meet me at my house , Linda . So if Julia 's in charge now , then what are we supposed to do next ? - I don 't know . - Exactly . She 's not the monarch . There 's no such thing . We have to take that egg to the real authorities . - Like Big Jim ? angle : No . We are not taking anything to that monster . Don 't talk like that . barbie : That 's the truth , Junior . I watched your father shoot Maxine in the head . She was bound and unarmed . - He executed her . junior : Bull . My dad ? Hurt a woman ? Probably one of the many reasons that the dome told us to assassinate Big Jim . No , I 'm done listening to you all run down my dad . He 's the only thing keeping this town together . - James , calm down . - Shut up . All you do is lie . Junior . She told me in these same tunnels . The only reason Julia 's even in Chester 's Mill is because she got fired from her last job for lying . Just like she 's lying about my dad right now . [ GUN COCKS ] junior : Hand it over , Julia . Run . junior : Angie , stop . Angie ! - No . - Go . - Barbie . - Go ! [ BOTH grunting ] Get up . Get up . You 're done . You 're done . Jim , can you just tell me what 's going on ? You wouldn 't believe me . That 's why I have to show you . Show me what ? My wife , Pauline , before she passed , she was paranoid , unstable , ranting about all kinds of crazy things . In her last months , she kept saying one thing over and over like a mantra . " The pink stars are falling . " Are you sure ? Maybe it 's a coincidence . [ twig SNAPS ] Oh . Thank God . NORRlE : Are you okay ? - Yeah . - How about the others ? - Junior got Barbie . What are we gonna do now ? Okay . Something this powerful has gotta be what 's generating the big dome . If we destroy the egg , maybe it 'll go away . Or maybe it 'll start another earthquake . Why don 't we just try asking it ? What do I say ? Whatever feels right . Please , just tell us what to do . Great . Can we try blowing it up now ? Holy . Mom ? So she knew all this was gonna happen . How is that possible ? I don 't know . But the whole time we kept thinking she was sick , maybe she was trying to warn us . I don 't know why I didn 't see it . Maybe I could have done more for her . Jim , you need to stay strong for us . I mean , if your wife saw the dome coming , that means your family 's important . That means you 're important . junior [ OVER radio ] : Linda , it 's Junior . - Where the hell have you been ? - I have Barbie in custody . I 'm bringing him in . - Mom . - Sweetheart . I don 't think that 's your mother . Forgive us . We 're still learning to speak with you . We 've taken on a familiar appearance to help bridge the divide . What divide ? What the hell are you ? JOE : I think ... I think it 's whoever sent the dome to Chester 's Mill . angle : Why ? Why are you punishing us ? The dome wasn 't sent to punish you . It was sent to protect you . Protect us from what ? You 'll see in time . How can we see anything now that you 've blacked out the dome ? alice : If you want the darkness to abate , you must earn the light . - How ? - By protecting the egg . And if we fail , it 's the end , isn 't it ? For all of us . So how do we protect it ? Who are we protecting it from ? Oh , no . I promise you , Junior , you 're on the wrong side of things . junior : Shut up . Welcome back . This egg , tell me where they took it . It 's the key to all this , isn 't it ? Making the darkness go away ? Controlling the dome ? You wanna know a secret ? You may think that you 're some kind of god to these people . I think we both know what you really are . What 's that , a criminal ? Worse . A politician . Okay , we 're clear . Go to the back room . Stay away from the windows . Are those gallows going up next to Town Hall ? This day just keeps getting awesomer . What do we do about the egg ? We need to hide it someplace safe . We 're all stuck in the same town . There 's nowhere to stash anything . jim [ OVER radio ] : This is Big Jim Rennie with a message for Julia Shumway . We know you have a dangerous weapon in your possession . Bring it to us now , and we 'll discuss a reduced sentence for your accomplice , Dale Barbara . But fail to comply within the hour , and Barbie pays the ultimate price for his crime . junior : Dad . Junior . Hey , good work with Barbie . - He and his crew - - They wanna assassinate you . What are you talking about ? They say that you 're dangerous , that you murdered people . Do you believe it ? Should I ? You know , son , before today I never put much stock in miracles . I went to see your mom 's old studio this afternoon . I haven 't set foot in there since the day she passed . You saw them ? The paintings ? Now , this dome , it wasn 't some accident . It was destiny . Our destiny . I don 't understand . There 's nothing a good man won 't do for the people he loves . That 's what your mom used to say all the time , right ? You want the truth ? I have taken lives . But none that didn 't absolutely need to be taken for the good of this town . Then why didn 't you tell me ? Because I thought I needed to protect you from all this . But I realize now that was a mistake . You and I are in this together . The Rennies . We were chosen . Your mother knew it , and she was trying with all her heart to tell us . Those pink stars she painted are a message , son . And they 're shining down on you . You and I need to do what nobody else in Chester 's Mill can . We need to make the hard decisions , act on them and lead . And from here on out , no more secrets between us . We have to help him . Barbie saved my life . But we can 't just give Big Jim the egg . My mom or - That woman said it would be the end for all of us - if we didn 't protect that thing . - What does that even mean ? It means our town is as good as dead if we let this fall into the wrong hands . NORRlE : Doesn 't get more wrong than Big Jim . Dome told us as much . JOE : How do we protect Chester 's Mill and save Barbie ? We can 't . So , what the hell do we do ? We don 't do anything . If I 'm really the monarch , this has to be my decision . You three have done enough . I want you to go get somewhere safe . What are you gonna do ? jim : I know you 're scared . I 'm scared too . From the very first day this dome appeared , elements from outside our fair town have attempted to sow the seeds of fear and hatred in an effort to divide us . No more . Today Chester 's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death . jim : Friends , clearly the good Lord has looked upon our work here today with favor . Let us thank him for this blessing . junior : Dad , what 's happening ? - Now , son . Do it now . Now , Junior ! Do it now !

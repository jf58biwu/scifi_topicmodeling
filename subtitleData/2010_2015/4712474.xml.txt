I know there is a lot of debat about why they hate us . but in the end , who that 's really matter ? Kill the enemy , or be killed . That 's the reality . In the war where mankind 's very survivor hangs in the balance that 's up to each of us to make a difference . Being a pilot is the best way I know how to do that . Your loving son , William Adama .

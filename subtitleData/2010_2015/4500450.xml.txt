 This is a drug that paralyzes the central nervous system at high speed . Dammit ! Chief , finish him off . Shingen ! Logan ! Father ! Please stop ! Miss , come along with us . Come on . Now , Chief , hurry and finish him off . You spoiled our contest . I had hoped to have a man-to-man duel with him . You can do what you will with him . Understood . I 've got movement ! Logan ? ! No , there 's no way he 'd be dead ... Kurohagi-san ... what happened to him ? It seems he 's returning to America . I 'll make sure he gets to the airport . And with that ... You 'll be able to focus on me , without distractions . ... Whether you want to , or not . Should we pursue them ? I 'll go . Do you have an estimate for their destination ? I want the rest of you to continue surveillance on the Shingen estate . But , sir ... It may have been to catch Shingen , but I still dragged Logan into this . He 's my responsibility . Asano-san ... If something happens to me , I want the rest of you to take Kuzuryu down . Asa â€” You let Asano-san go alone ? ! You idiot ! You know he tends to go overboard ! I 'm on my way back now ! Those bastards ... It 's dangerous to hang around the railroads when you 're drunk off your ass , Logan-san . Logan ! Logan ! Logan ! Logan ? ! Logan ! Logan ? ! You two ! Asano-san ! Are you alright ? Where 's Logan ? I don 't know . He vanished . Vanished ? Yeah . No , more importantly , what are you two doing here ? You can reprimand us later . These were the Kuzuryu goons . Someone took them down in a single blow . They 're the ones who were carrying Logan . You think it 's some sort of power struggle ? I 'm not sure . Other than Shingen , I don 't know of anyone who could pull this off ... I contacted HQ . I see . No matter how you look at it , they tried to murder Logan . Should we use that to get a warrant and go after the Kuzuryu ? No ... they 'll just offer someone up as a patsy so we won 't be able to tie anything to Shingen . Who was it that attacked me and those men ? No response from Logan ... What ? ! Father ... I 'll do as you say ... So please ... don 't hurt Logan . As long as you stay quiet and marry Kurohagi . Logan ... escaped . Mariko ! Are you going to skewer your savior on those claws ? You heal astonishingly fast . Considering you were on the receiving end of Yashida Shingen 's sword , wooden or not , and then a fancy nerve agent . I doubt a normal person could survive all that ... I saw the whole thing . Who 're you ? I can tell you this much : I 'm not your enemy . You want Yashida Mariko back , right ? I 'll help you . A vendetta against Shingen ? He ... killed my mother . My mother was an assassin who had been trained by him . Her duty was to kill anyone who defied the Kuzuryu . But one time , my mother failed in her duty . Just one time ... It was her first mistake . I 'll make ... I 'll make Shingen pay . Were you looking for this ? It had a voice ID lock , so ... Logan . Logan . I need to see my pal , Asano . You know where this is ? Nobody home ? Hold it ! What 's wrong ? I can smell blood ... No way ... Asano ! You alright ? ! Asano ! Asano ? ! Something really sharp went right through his heart . Logan ! Don 't move ! We received a report that Inspector Asano had been killed ! Looks like you 've been framed . You son of a bitch ! It wasn 't me . But I doubt you 're gonna listen ... First cops , now yakuza ? No holding back this time ! Dammit ! How 'd they find me ? You don 't think this is Kuzuryu trying to finish you off ? The Wolverine ... ? A truly intriguing opponent ... Mikage Kikyo ? ! Another one of Shingen 's assassins ! What ? ! En garde ! I didn 't think I 'd run into another mutant in Japan ... Can you beat Kikyo ? All that 's left is the ceremony ... You 're the one who killed Asano ! Whomever the victor may be , this will be settled . Next time on Wolverine : Kikyo .

 Previously on Helix ... How long have you known about your tumor ? Are you high ? I had a migraine , so I took ... You 're lying , unless you took the whole bottle . I don 't want to become one of those things . You know what I 'm asking . Thank you . - How long does he have ? - Take this time and make the most of it . Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . This wasn 't a goddamn accident ! I 've got a reply for that message ! I 'm sorry , Doreen . We fought through ... seven outbreaks together , and I always thought I was the one leading you . It turns out you were the one pushing me . Have you located Balleseros ? No , not yet . Doreen 's murder was no coincidence . - I 'm not sure I follow . - Oh , you follow just fine . But let me spell it out for you anyway , whatever Balleseros is up to , it has everything to do with this virus . If you want to pretend you don 't know that , that 's fine . But I want him found . Who 's this ? Dr. Rae Van Eigem . I found her on Level B after Level R was sealed off . She died before the coma could set in . You found her on Level B ? Why wasn 't I notified ? There wasn 't time . I isolated her and tended to her needs as best I could . This is NARVIK-B . She should be a vector , not a corpse . How did she die , Sarah ? Morphine - overdose . Who administered the dose ? I did what I thought was right . So much for not killing the infected , right , Doc ? I am going down to Level R and I am bringing back Dr. Walker . You might want to inform your boss . He 's dealing with an emergency situation . What emergency situation could possibly be more pressing than this outbreak ? He 'll be back when he 's finished , and no one is going down to Level R no one in , no one out . That includes Dr. Walker . You 're gonna shoot me , Daniel ? Is that really your play here ? You need to get back to your lab . I don 't work for you ! Do you have any idea what this thing is ? What it 's doing to people ? I 'm aware , yes . People are sick . Not sick ; they 're dying ! Your brother is showing signs of improvement . My brother barely has brain activity , no thanks to Hatake ! Dr. Hatake and I both want the same thing you do . That gun in your hand is telling a different story , son ! Will you two cut it out ? Get ... back to work . Now . I 'll take care of her . Peter . What are you doing here ? I came to help you . Help me with what ? You ... You 're not real . Feels pretty real . Go away . Still here . You must want me to stay for a reason . Like what ? Who is she ? Hello ? - So , what now ? - I 'm going down to get Julia . - Wait , what about ... - She wrote the book on viral splicing and RNA binding proteins . I need her - we need her - to fight this thing . Alan , we don 't know how sick she is . We don 't even know if she can work . No , we don 't . But Doreen is dead , Balleseros has gone missing , and we are back to square one . Jules is our best hope . - She 's our only hope . - How do we get down to Level R ? The stairwells are sealed shut and Daniel controls the elevator . I 'll have to improvise . By the way , these are for you , for your migraines . Gabapentin . Where did you ... Dr. Sulemani used them for OCD . They should work . No more morphine . All right ? I need you sharp . You and I are all we have left . If we don 't have each other , if we don 't back each other up , we have nothing . Absolutely . And ... thank you . Cafeteria is now open . Cafeteria is now open . Cafeteria is now ... Oh , my God . What is it ? - Your wound . - Infection ? No , it 's ... it 's healing remarkably fast . Must have good genes . Must have . Are you all right ? Why didn 't you tell me ? Tell you what ? That I was hallucinating ! That Jaye wasn 't real . Why did you let me go on believing she was here ? Do you enjoy watching people suffer ? I am a doctor first , like you . My job is to save people . By lying to them ? I didn 't tell you , because I didn 't need to . You were disoriented , and speaking to Jaye seemed to be helping . I 'm sorry . You 're right . Help ! Help ! No ! Not everyone can be saved . Dr. Walker ? Julia ! Julia . It 's been a long time since I 've made thermite . It was in high school - senior prank . It didn 't go very well . This was no quarantine , it was a " seal and forget . " Dark in there . I can 't see much . They 're probably all huddled in the labs . We 'll never find her like this . We have to go inside . I think I see something at the end of the hall . Go ! - Come here . - Alan , stop . I 'm fine . If there 's an abrasion or a cut or anything of the kind ... - I 'm fine . - We have to make sure . You know that . I had no idea there 'd be so many of them . I ought to have my head examined for putting you at risk . I chose to go down there with you . Listen , first Doreen , then Jules . I can 't lose you too , Sarah . What are we gonna do about Julia ? To get to her , we have to go through those ... - Those monsters ? - I was going to say " those patients . " desperately sick patients . If we want to get to Jules , we 'll have to treat them first . What if we can 't ? Then they 'll bury this base ... with us in it . What are you doing ? You passed out . Don 't worry , Julia . We 'll have you back on your feet in no time . What are you doing to my eyes ? I can 't see . What is that ? I 'm giving you a sedative . You should sleep . I don 't want to sleep . Shh . You 're going to be OK . Access granted . Aw ! What the hell ? - Who are you ? - I could ask you the same thing . I 'm Anana . Anana ? Where am I ? You 're in my home . Are these really necessary ? Don 't know you from Adam . In that case , maybe I should cuff you too . I 'm Sergio . I assume I have you to thank for punching me in the face ? You kept trying to fight me . How are you feeling otherwise , Sergio ? Like hell . That 's better than expected for a guy who was left for dead on the ice . - What is this green shit ? - It 's a seaweed pack . We 're not exactly near the Mayo Clinic , so relax . You 're the law ? Only peace officer within 400 miles of Tonrar settlement . - Tonrar ? - Means " Ghost . " Sounds scarier than what it is . We don 't stay in one place very long . Here , drink this . It 'll warm you up . You 're lucky to have all your fingers and ... What 'd you have to do that for , huh ? I was trying to be hospitable . - It hurts . - Good ! Let that be our introduction . Bullshit ! - What am I , a hostage ? - Depends . This can be as dirty as you want it to be . - What do you want ? - I want what 's in here . Tell me what you know about Arctic Biosystems . I don 't know anything . That 's how you want to play it ? All right , then maybe you are a hostage . - This is ridiculous ! - If you want to talk , great . If not , I can always bring you back to the base and let whoever tried to kill you finish off what they started . Sarah ... come have a look at this . Tell me what you see . The virus is attacking the cell , multiplying rapidly . Look again . Look more closely . Oh , my god . I can 't believe I didn 't see it before . How could you have ? We weren 't looking for it . He 's using the virus as a delivery mechanism . The question is : what 's the virus bringing to the party ? And why ? Son of a bitch . - Dr. Farragut . - What 's in the virus ? - Nothing . - I saw it with my own eyes . What did you splice into its genetic code ? I don 't know what you mean . I know you 're using the virus as a delivery mechanism . Now , what kind of gene therapy are you messing with ? You used my brother as a lab rat ! You played with his life , with Julia 's life , with the rest of those poor people on Level R. You put this place here so you wouldn 't be regulated , so you could play God with people 's lives ! Look where 's it 's gotten you ! Tell me the truth . Yes ... NARVIK is a ... delivery system . But there is no conspiracy , Dr. Farragut . That , I 'm afraid , is in your head . As far as your brother ... he was no lab rat . What then ? What is all this ? A way to treat what was once untreatable . Cancer . All five classifications . Think of it : a cure for one of the deadliest diseases of our time . Instead of causing harm , the virus delivers a cure . It 's brilliant . Unfortunately , we haven 't perfected it yet . It wasn 't the virus . What 's not ? The virus made Peter sick but it didn 't change him . It was the gene therapy inside the virus . What did you put into the NARVIK-B strain that changed him ? Nothing . We hadn 't introduced the gene therapy . There is something inside this virus . And I will find it . I need you to tell me what 's really going on here . It doesn 't concern you . Your safety and the safety of this base is my only concern . I can 't protect you if I 'm in the dark . A lot has happened while you were away . Balleseros found Dr. Hvit . - - What ? How did he ... - it 's not a problem . I took care of him . Took care of him ? How ? Introduced him to the business end of an ice axe . Left him out on the ice . What have you done ? You said yourself he was a threat . I eliminated him . You fool ! Don 't you see ? ! When he fails to check in , they will come . You need to eat . Your body is trying to heal . Like you care . You 're no good to me dead . Fine . I just want to know why I 'm here . So , we 're doing this dance again ? I told you why you 're here . Arctic Biosystems . I already told you , I don 't know anything . You knew enough that someone tried to shank your ass and leave you for dead . That was a personal thing . Had nothing to do with the base . What about the research they do ? Tell me about the children . What children ? What are you talking about ? ! We can try this again later . Gonna be the same whenever you try it . That depends on how hungry you get ! They are so cute at that age . What is this place ? Why did you bring me here ? Hey , this is your dance party . I 'm just along for the ride . Maybe you should ask her . About what ? Maybe she 's trying to get you to remember something . Something you 've forgotten . How am I supposed to remember something I 've forgotten ? Nothing 's ever really forgotten not if you don 't want it to be . Go ahead , ask her . Hi . I 'm Julia . That 's my name too . What is this place , Julia ? This is my house . You mean you live here ? Only in the summer . I come here with my mommy . I used to spend the summer with my mommy too . You did ? Mm-hmm . In a place called Montana . Have you ever heard of it ? Of course I have , silly . Where do you think we are right now ? Yes . This is where I grew up . This is Montana , where I lived with my mother . I 'm home . Now we wait . Something like that . What the hell ? Have you ever ... What 's it doing ? Reacting to the cold . Extreme low temperatures . Slowing down the effects of the virus . Which means this might work on humans . We need to get Peter on ice . Lift his head . All right . Alan , what was that thing ? Whatever it was , the cold slowed it down . I 've never seen anything like that in my life . Sarah , no one has seen anything like that . It 's working . It 's working , but we have to get him colder . There was a lab . Down on Level G , doing some kind of cryo work . - Who ? - Um ... Dr. Victor Adrian . You stay here . Get him colder and get him prepped to move . OK . Key . Key . Don 't . Understand ? Don 't ! Do you understand ? ! - Easy ! - You want to know why you 're here ? Take a look . - What am I looking at ? A bunch of kids ? - Missing kids . Thirty-one over the past two decades , all within 200 miles of Arctic Biosystems and your precious Dr. Hatake . I don 't understand . Someone 's been stealing our children . You have no idea who you 're protecting . Or maybe you do . You tell me . You try anything again , I will shoot you . That 's funny . We 'll sneak up on her slow . I 'll be right behind you . Don 't be afraid . Victor Adrian ? I 'm Alan Farragut of the CDC . Piss off . - I was watching that . - I need your help . I 've been stuck here for a week like a caged animal . What do you expect me to do ? Put out a welcome mat ? I know the situation has been less than ideal . Now that is the understatement of the year . What do I get out of it ? - Excuse me ? - Quid pro quo . I scratch your back , you scratch mine . - Do we understand each other ? - What is it you want ? First , you 're gonna call off the guards . I haven 't taken a shit without a chaperone for the last six days . Second , I want to be first in line out of this hell-hole when the cavalry arrive . All right , all right . You help me solve this , and you will be first in line . I guarantee it . Dr. Alan Farragut , how may I be of assistance ? You work with cooling systems ? Cryo-therapy ? VFC Immersion . Latest and greatest . Does it work ? Why don 't you say hello to some of my friends ? - Stop right there ! - You both work for Hatake . - Is that it ? ! - Let him go . - He tried to kill me back at the base ! - What ? When ? You want information about Hatake ? Here 's your man ! Go ahead ! Ask him ! Are you out of your mind ? ! That 's my brother ! - Daniel is your brother ? - Who 's Daniel ? That 's my brother Tulok ! You want to tell me why you attacked my brother ? I was just ... trying to escape . This is a picture of me and my brothers . Twins . You met Tulok outside . This is Miksa . He disappeared when we were kids . He was only four years old . Where 's Miksa now ? You tell me , you son of a bitch . - Have you seen him ? - I need to go back to the base . We need to go back to the base . Look , I didn 't know we 'd be trying this out on an actual person , let alone someone as bad off as he is . - I can 't promise anything . - Understood . VFC immersion hypothermia . Human trials , take one . How do you stop the body 's natural defense mechanisms against the cold ? It is all in how we cool the body down . The solution is taken into his lungs while it simultaneously soaks into the skin and envelops the entire body , inside and on the out . So how does he breathe ? He doesn 't breathe . Humans don 't breathe for the first nine months . It 's a matter of keeping him oxygenated . Either way , we still have a deal right ? No matter how this goes . Just give me a little more time , Peter . Let 's do this . Julia , come on . Time to eat . Why are you here ? You 're the one that made her sick . This is all your fault . My fault ? Don 't blame me . We 're all trapped here because of her . - That 's not fair . - Who said anything about fair ? This is all in your head . Why are we even here ? I don 't know . Pass the cranberry sauce . - Thank you - It 's all about you , Julia . It 's always been about you . He 's right , y 'know . He 's right . You got us into this mess . I 'm not ... I mean , I didn 't ... I just , I didn 't mean to get ... Oh , come on . I just want answers . You don 't even know the right questions to ask . Why you , Julia ? Why this virus ? Why now ? I 'm starved . Can we do this while we eat ? You have all the answers . You just don 't know it . I 'm trying to remember , but I can 't . Just figure it out already . Figure it out so we can eat . Would anyone like sweet potatoes ? Maybe the question isn 't why we 're here as much as why are we 're HERE this place , the cabin where you grew up . Maybe this would be easier if we all ate something . Will you carve , Jules ? Wait , this isn 't supposed to be happening . This is not happening ! Are y ... are you sure about this ? He 'll adapt . He 'll settle . It 's normal . Normal for what ? It 's OK . The monkeys did the exact same thing . The rats too . This is killing him . Alan . Alan ! - He 's drowning . - No . No . If there 's any chance we could save him ... His core temperature 's dropping . It 's 95 . Eighty-five . Seventy-five . Sixty-five . Fifty-five degrees . Alan . Can he see us ? No . I don 't think so . But it 's something . Progress . The CDC seems to have had a breakthrough . I 'm sorry for disappointing you . - Please forgive me , father ... - It 's my fault . I didn 't prepare you well enough . I made a mistake . There are no mistakes , only opportunities wasted . It won 't happen again . Good . We don 't have much time to prepare . What do you want me to do ? First ... show me Major Balleseros ' body . It 's amazing . Brain activity isn 't 100 % , but it 's a start . Alan , are you OK ? This is where I left him . Right here . I took his jacket and boots . He couldn 't have got far . He 's been taken . I 'll go find him . No . We 'll deal with this later . They 're here . Are you OK ? Yeah . Warning : incoming flight . Warning : incoming flight . Thank God . The cavalry 's here . How ? I never got the call out . On the next Helix . - Military ? - No , my corporate patrons . Dr. Walker , why is she locked up ? She 's infected . Peter ? Hiroshi has destroyed everyone who has ever been close to him , don 't let him do the same to you . Sutton can be a dangerous enemy . Stop it ! stop it ! I don 't think our agenda is her agenda .

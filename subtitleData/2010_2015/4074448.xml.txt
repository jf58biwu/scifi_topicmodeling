Okay , but this isn 't because of your beautiful skin , I 'm doing this to save our lives . Somebody help ! Help ! This ... this is making me more straight . They 're getting in ! It 's time to take a stand ! Gay or straight , discrimination has to be stopped . Simon ... Don 't do it , Simon , you 're only gonna make things worse . I wanna burn him ! I wanna burn him ! Maybe he 'll make things better . ? Hey ! I 'm Simon and I 'm straight . And I 'm not afraid to be who I am . Straight or gay , we all have the right to walk down the halls of Crowley High free of persecution and harassment . If we could only look past our differences , to see what we have in common , we can work together to make our school a better place . Look I 'm sure each and everyone of you has once felt alone , unloved , or misunderstood . Let 's let our differences weave us into a ruch tapestry of harmony instead of tearing us apart in an angry mob of bigotry and hate ! Get him ! ( mob screams ) ( jock ) This is for reminding me that I 'm all alone ! AHHHHHHHH ! ( cheerleader ) This is for reminding me that I 'm unloved ! I didn 't see that coming . I did . So you failed , which is what you do . ( Atticus ) I did not fail . It 's not my fault my camera was confiscated and destroyed . By the way , I still have the receipt , so if you could reimburse me out of petty cash ... ( hooded leader ) Silence ! ( hooded leader ) What am I looking at ? Uh , it 's a sketch of the boy 's penis . Why does his penis have lightening around it ? It 's pubic hair . This is a sketch of your penis . It is not . How would you even know if it was ? Do not think for a second , Atticus , that we do not watch you . Who watches my penis ? ( Atticus ) Oh . And I thought I was low man on the totem pole . His job is to watch your penis , yo ur job is to bring us the book ! Whatever you say , your evilness , yes . What a trashhole . What else have we learned today ? I 've learned that teachers don 't seem to care what goes on around here . Hey , Jenny , I think I need to take the gay test again . Not on your life , Todd . I 'll give you the test . Nah , that 's okay , Hannah . Man , I can 't believe the most action I 've ever gotten was with you . If it 's any consolation , you 're a pretty good kisser . Really ? You think so ? ( Curtis ) You 're a way better kisser than Allan . Ugh , tell me about it .

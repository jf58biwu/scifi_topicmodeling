 PETE : Previously on Warehouse 13 ... STEVE : You 've collected quite a few artifacts . Yeah , enough to even up the odds . An enemy with an arsenal of artifact weapons would not only be dangerous ... They could be unstoppable . I want you to feel the pain , like I have . ( BEEPING ) ARTIE : This is an Astrolabe . That 'll buy us back twenty-four hours . BROTHER ADRIAN : You can tell no one ! Damn it , they 're gone . Too late . You wanted to save him , so save him , damn it ! Breathe ! ( GASPS ) ( CLAUDIA GASPS ) ( SIGHS ) That hat was itchy , huh ? It 's a great picture , though . Did you get all your stuff ? This is the last of it . You know , I don 't know what 's creepier , the fact that all my stuff was sent to the Dead Agents Vault , or that there is a Dead Agents Vault . Why don 't we focus on the fact that you 're not in the Dead Agents Vault ? Pollyanna . ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) So , mission briefing in Artie 's office ? Yeah . Pete 's all worked up about something . ( CHUGGING ) PETE : Hot . Water . Okay , people ? Now that we 're back to five at the BB , we need to talk about the bathroom situation . Pete , it 's an old house . You can 't take 30 minute showers . Uh-uh-uh . Leena . The half-hour power shower is a sacred thing . Okay ? Also , I used the rest of the peppermint body scrub . Oh , that was mine ! Well , you weren 't using it . That 's because I was dead . Oh , you gotta play that card ? Right now , I 'm wishing I was dead . This is the mission briefing ? No . ( SIGHS ) No , it isn 't . Leena , uh , this is from the Ovoid Quarantine . It doesn 't like anyplace I put it . So , can you ... Well , of course it doesn 't . Just look at it . Silly me . All right , we got a ping this morning from Devil 's Lake , North Dakota . Ooh ! Same barren landscape as South Dakota but colder ! A cleaning lady showed up at the hospital . She had all the symptoms of a spider bite , but ... There were no actual marks . The venom that was found inside her system turned out to be from an incredibly rare South American spider called the ... The Theraphosa leblondi . ( WHISPERING ) The Thera ... Please tell me that 's not just a random lucky guess ? Are you gonna be psychic now , too ? That 's really gonna get annoying . No , no , no . I 've seen the artifact that does this . It 's a small wooden token . Well , where did you see it ? In the hangar . It belonged to Walter Sykes . Steve , you spent a long time with Walter Sykes and he had an arsenal of artifacts . And he was firing them at us . Where would he have kept them ? He had them stored in these crates labeled " A to Z Technologies . " But by the time he moved them , I was dead . But when we raided the hangar there was nothing there . Well , he could 've stored them at Devil 's Lake . Well , it is only a four hour drive . He could have had Marcus take them there before he came to the BB . Or Tyler . Nope . Tyler was ... ( MAKES SNAPPING SOUND ) Well , actually , he was ... ( MAKES CROAKING SOUND ) Pete . Okay , I got the spider-lady 's route from the cleaning service . She was at these three residences in Devil 's Lake yesterday . That one . The Mazzanti residence . Artie , Enrico Mazzanti , he was the original illustrator of Carlos Collodi 's Pinocchio . Pinocchio . And Sykes was obsessed with Collodi 's bracelet . ( BEEPS ) ARTIE : Safe house . You two go check it out . Be ... Be careful . Because if that house actually has an arsenal of artifacts , it could be a powder keg ! Okay . ( GRUNTS ) Pete , you could have just picked the lock . Well , better safe than sorry , Mykes . Plus , I love doing that . MYKA : Pete ! PETE : Yeah ? Check this out . Yeah . I 'm not really seeing the Sykes family resemblance . These are just the pictures that come in the frames . That 's why the cleaning lady only came once a month . This place was just for appearances . Temporary digs for him to hide out after his mega-bomb blew us all to kingdom come , huh ? Let 's just find the rest of Sykes ' toys and we can close the book on this loser for good . Okay . Okay . Ugh ! ( SPITS ) Plastic ! He really was evil . ( BUZZING ) Oh , great . A creepy basement . ( SIGHS ) Gotcha . Theraphosa leblondi . PETE : Myka ! Pete , you found the artifacts ? Empty . Somebody beat us to the prize . JESSE : So , that 's a bird cage , violin , golf clubs and some junk from our basement . Look , they belonged to my grandma . They 're antiques . Probably worth thousands . ( SCOFFS ) Then why pawn them to me ? Oh , I thought this was one of those places where you sell things for money , but I guess I 'm just in , like , the worst bakery ever . I 'll take them someplace else . Okay , okay . Don 't get all ruffled . Let me check my price guides in the back . ( AIR WHOOSHING ) ( CLINKING ) What the hell ? I 'll give you 400 for the bunch . Are you kidding me ? That 's not enough . That 's not nearly enough . Kid , it 's just a bunch ofjunk . ( SIGHING ) Ah , for crying out loud . All right , six . Seven . Six-fifty . Fine . Jeez . And what about the pipe you 've got behind your back ? This is mine . Six-forty , then . The artifacts are gone ? All of them ? Well , maybe Sykes had somebody grab them in case something happened to him . You know , like a back-up plan to his back-up plan . No , Marcus and Tyler were the only other two I ever saw work with him . CLAUDIA : And they 're both dead . Well , whoever did it must 've dropped the spider-bite artifact on the way out . ( CRACKLING ) Yeah . But why smash the crates ? Why not just take the whole thing ? ARTIE : Probably too obvious . Pete ? Yeah ? Look at this . Yeah , an alarm system . So , if there was a break-in , why didn 't the security company come ? PETE : Maybe the alarm didn 't go off . Or maybe whoever did it knew the code . But padlocks don 't have codes , which would explain why they had to force open the door to the basement . That alarm company is Safeco Security . CLAUDIA : Their office is in downtown Devil 's Lake . I 'm sending you the address right now . What are you doing talking to us ? You got the address . Go . Hello ! Well , hello . Shouldn 't you be eating donuts ? Doctor Oz says tomatoes are a superfood . We 're here to ask you a few questions . Excellent . You wanna grab a drink or something ? About the break-in at the Mazzanti residence . I can 't give out that kind of information . United States Secret Service . Uh , let me just get my supervisor . So , if you just wait right here . Think he 's hiding something ? Either that or the burrito 's on its way out . ( CLATTERING ) ( IMITATES SIREN ) We 've got the place surrounded ! Oh God ! Please don 't arrest me ! Please ! All right . Who stole the boxes , huh ? Did Sykes hire you ? What ? Who ? Walter Sykes . The owner of the house that you broke into . No . No , the whole thing was Jesse 's idea ! Jesse ? Who 's Jesse ? Jesse Ashton . I went to high school with him . We were drinking last week at P.J. Whelihan 's . Jesse said that he needed money so I gave him the codes . Oh God , I need a lawyer , don 't I ? Do you know a lawyer ? Wait . So you have nothing to do with Walter Sykes ? No ! Who ? I can 't go to prison ! All right , so Jesse takes everything that 's there . Then what ? He says he knows a place where he can sell it and that we 'd split the money . You know , the History Channel has got to stop glamorizing the pawn industry . Makes it easy . We bag the artifacts , we 're back in time for dinner . Uh-oh . What ? Bad vibe . I think we 're gonna be late for dinner . PETE : Hey . Wow . Yeah . Blew out the whole window . No . I mean this pawn shop doesn 't look anything like the one on that TV show . See ? That 's what I 've been saying ! Oh ! Hey , Leena ! Look at you ! Out in the field . No , no , no , no , no . This is all wrong . Yeah . Okay . These headphones cannot be next to this mask like this . And this iron should never lay flat . Yeah . See , uh , with all these artifacts in play , I wanted Leena here to ... Do whatever it is Leena does . Yeah , no , no , no . More the merrier . We 're gonna need extra hands on this one . So what happened ? Uh , well , the owner gave this a jingle . No ! That made the fireball . Yeah . This is Mrs. O 'Leary 's cowbell , wouldn 't you know . I thought the cow kicking over a lantern , that was just a made-up story . No , the lantern 's a made-up story . It was the bell that caused the Great Chicago Fire . In fact it was this bell that was in the doorway of a bakery shop , caused the Great Fire of London in 1666 . Well , the owner is singed , but he 'll live . Sykes had more artifacts than these . Where are the rest of them ? Well , you can thank rising consumer confidence for that . The owner already sold six of them . Six artifacts out there loose in one city ? This is a disaster . Fortunately , everybody pays by credit card these days . So in a few minutes , we 'll have names and addresses . What could be easier ? Nah . ( GROANS ) No . Don 't say easy . We 'll miss dinner completely . MYKA : We do have one more problem . The ... The owner said that the guy who sold him the artifacts , Jesse Ashton , actually kept one for himself . An old smoking pipe . It could be Sir Walter Raleigh 's . It ... It allows you to travel through small ... No , no , no , no , no . I snagged that in the ' 80s . Although , Admiral Byrd 's pipe is still missing . Look , for all we know it could be Cheech and Chong 's . But since he kept it , it looks like our hood rat house burglar thinks he might have an artifact . Okay , you two go after him . And , uh , Claudia , you and Steve take half this list and get the sunglasses , bird cage and waffle iron . Leena and I will take the other half and get the golf clubs and violin . Pete , you and Myka get that pipe . And let 's do it fast . Otherwise , this town 's gonna have a very bad day . Wait ! We 've got to do something about these artifacts . Oh , yeah , sure . Right . Well , maybe he just took the pipe because he wanted to look cool . Smoking a pipe isn 't cool . What ? Hey , Dan Aykroyd smokes a pipe . ( CHUCKLING ) Oh , well that changes everything then . You know , I hope that Jesse 's as dopey as his accomplice . Careful . Mykes , Mykes . We still don 't know what the pipe does . ( BUZZING ) You go . Well , ( SIGHS ) I 'm guessing one thing it does is remove ceilings . So , first mission for Donovan and Jinks since the big sleep . You excited ? Yeah . Sure . I can tell . You 're practically bursting . No , it 's just the last time we went artifact hunting , I wasn 't being kept alive by one . Not that I 'm not incredibly grateful for the whole not-being-dead thing , but ... We still don 't know the risks of the Metronome . Ah , don 't be such a Debbie Downside . Look , we 've got our youth and a list . You know what ? I call scavenger hunt ! I bet I can snag more artifacts on this list than you can , Debbie . If I say no , you 're gonna make me play anyways , aren 't you ? The challenger has accepted ! Right . Hi there ! Are you here for our Summer-sational Sale ? Ooh , sale ? There 's a sale ? Thongs give me a rash . We 're looking for a Jordan Tivoli . Might be sporting a new pair of sunglasses . Jordan normally works in the stockroom . Kind of a weird guy . But I haven 't seen him for hours . Why ? Have you noticed anything strange around here recently ? Perhaps the smell of fudge ? ( GASPING ) That 's the Fudge Faktory next door . Yum ! But now that you mention it , things have been falling off shelves a lot today . And earlier I thought I heard someone sneeze , but I was all alone here . Could have been a panic attack , though . I get those a lot . ( BEEPING ) Excuse us . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Uh , what was that ? I entered the sunglasses info into the U.A.D. The U.A. D ? Unsnagged Artifact Database . So , it says here the sunglasses might have belonged to a John A. Macready . Oh , he was the pilot who first developed Ray-Bans . I guess his first pair worked so well at reflecting light , they made the wearer invisible to the human eye . So you think an invisible Jordan is just ... Hanging around the store ? Why would he do that ? Well . ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) And now I see why . There 's a ghost in there ! ( PANTING ) Who ya gonna call ? Okay , so the next-door neighbor said she heard a really loud crash about an hour ago . But thought it was the meth lab downstairs . Nice neighborhood . Pete , just check out these burns . I mean , they kind of look like lightning strikes . All right . So something that controls lightning ? Did Thor smoke a pipe ? So where would a small-time thief go if he suddenly stumbled upon a powerful artifact ? For starters , I 'd use it to get an apartment with a roof . Whoa ! Laptop ! Ah ! I am gonna check the browser history . Look at you , going all Claudia . Uh-huh . He was online about an hour ago . Ooh ! Hey , Mykes . Human Anatomy . I hope it has pictures . And it does . Pete . Yeah ? MYKA : I think we know where he 's going next . I don 't hear any violins . No . But according to the girl 's mother , her lesson only started ten minutes ago . So , maybe we 've got time to ... ( CRASHES ) Or not ! Much better , Tia ! Keep the fingers curved . And again . ( VIOLIN PLAYING ) ( AIR WHOOSHING ) Stop playing ! Stop it ! Hey ! She 's just a beginner ! It 's okay . It 's okay . We 're with the Department of ... Of Contagion . Contagion . Uh . This violin , was it bought at a pawn shop downtown ? My mom bought it this morning . This ... This isn 't the avian flu , is it ? Or SARS ? Get ... Get it out of here ! It 's okay . Your mom sent us . Yeah . TEACHER : Aren 't you going to quarantine her ? Wash your hands . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) Okay . Oh ! Napoleon . That figures . What ? I 'm fairly certain this is the violin Napoleon played in exile . If that girl would 've hit a G sharp , this town would have erupted in a wave of violence that would have made 13 Vendemiaire seem like a street fair . All right , one down . What 's next ? Uh , Devil 's Lake Golf and Country Club . A Jew and a black woman go to a fancy country club . All we need is a priest and a horse and we could do the whole joke . PETE : Hey , Mykes . He says there 's a guy out front who saw it . Pete , it 's snowing . Why is it snowing in the summer ? Must be a residual effect of the pipe . Kid could make a killing in Palm Springs . ( SIGHING ) Yeah . Oh . Excuse me , sir ? Could you ... Could you tell us what happened ? Some kind of rogue tornado . One minute it 's all clear , and the next ... It 's snowing . It came outta nowhere . Thank God nobody was killed . It 's snowing . It is . Thank you for ... For that ... Pete ? Check out this ATM . I mean , that was ... That was Jesse 's target . All right . So ... He can make lightning and tornadoes and snow . For a few thousand bucks , he almost killed a couple of folks . I mean , what happened in his apartment , that was an accident . This ? He 's learning how to control it . A bad guy with this kind of power ? Talk about stormy weather . JESSE : That 's not enough . That 's not nearly enough . ( AIR WHOOSHING ) ( CRACKLING ) JESSE : Time to do some serious damage ! Lord , what 's Jesse done now ? Mrs. Ashton , when was the last time you saw your son ? It 's been weeks . What 's happened ? Well , then again , with the Secret Service after him maybe I don 't want to know . Well , he got his hands on something pretty dangerous . So anything you could tell us would help . Well , poor boy 's always had a terrible temper . It 's brought him and us no end of trouble . Even ever since he was little . He never finished school , couldn 't hold down a job , always blaming others for his own misfortunes . I suppose there 's just some things in this world you can 't control . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Mrs. Ashton , I 'm so sorry . Could I trouble you for , um , a glass of water ? Let me fix you a cup of tea . Thank you . Wow , did you just use the old " can I get a glass of water " move ? Well , Pete , sometimes the classics work . MYKA : How many banks did we pass driving through town ? Uh , I wasn 't counting . I saw three Dairy Queens , though . MYKA : Look at these bills . Pete , Country Sky was foreclosing on the Ashton house . Jesse could have hit any bank in town , but he chose Country Sky . Yeah , the one his family owes money to . I mean , it makes sense . The kid 's running a one man Occupy Devil 's Lake . But that 's the only branch in town , so ... Where does he go next ? Mykes , he 's making storms , right ? So maybe we don 't need to predict his next target . Maybe we just need to predict the weather . Oh , are you leaving ? Yes , we have to go . Well , if you find Jesse please don 't hurt him . He 's still my son . Thank you . Mmm . Bye . Bye . No sign of the hollow man yet . Well , just keep your eyes open . You do know he 's invisible , right ? STEVE : Well , then keep your ears open . You know , you 're really not supposed to be watching the dressing room monitors . I mean , it 's corporate policy . STEVE : Oh , it 's okay . I 'm a federal agent . Also , I 'm gay . Oh , my God . Do you watch Revenge ? No ... CLAUDIA : Steve . Steve , I heard something . Claudia , he 's right behind you . What ... You can see him ? Yeah , you 're looking right at him . CLAUDIA : Where , exactly ? He shows up on camera . What ... Hey . Whoa . ( THUDDING ) Check this out . ( GROANS ) Invisible to the naked eye , but not the digital one . Hah ! All right . CLAUDIA : Let 's see . Uh-huh . Aha . I 'm definitely having a panic attack . Cool shades . What 's going on ? I can 't see anything . Just a side effect of your peek-a-boo shades . You 'll be blind for twice as long as you were wearing them . But I had them on for hours . I didn 't hurt anyone . I was just ... STEVE : Window shopping , we know . Your eyesight will come back , but I 'd say you lost your job for good . You okay ? Hmm ? Oh , yeah . Must just be sore from too much Pop Physique yesterday . Come on , we 've got more artifact shopping to do . First point to you , poopypants . You know , I prefer Jinksy . Thank you . ARTIE : Leena , okay , so Hank Conway . Checked in for his tee time , but nobody 's seen him since . Artie , look . Artie ! Golfers don 't usually leave those lying around . BJ . Bobby Jones . Oh , my God . These are the clubs Bobby Jones used in the 1921 British Open . His temper got the better of him , he stormed off the course , but not before throwing these clubs all over the green . Oh , well , we better keep them away from John McEnroe 's tennis racket . ( CHUCKLES ) Yeah , but why are they just lying here ? Sand wedge . Uh , the 9 iron 's missing . I think Conway 's probably got it . LEENA : I don 't think so . According to the photo we got off the Internet ... ARTIE : Aha ! You must be Mr. Conway . Bit of a headache . ( SIGHS ) MYKA : Okay , so we are up and running . So if the pipe creates storms , it also creates a , uh , a low pressure front , right ? Exactly . And if Jesse 's raising the roof , we 'll be able to track him on weather radar . That 's really smart , Pete . ( CHUCKLING ) Man , I feel just like Helen Hunt in Twister . Bill Paxton . I mean , I feel like Bill Paxton . Hey , Helen ? ( GROANS ) You wanna take a look at that ? PETE : Oh , look at that . Looks like we got a Jesse front moving in from the northeast . Right , it 's ... It 's , uh , centering on the corner of Glenwood and Eagle Crest Road . Okay . Watch this . What are you doing ? ELECTRONIC VOICE : After the beep , please say a command . Uh , destination Glenwood and Eagle Crest . ELECTRONIC VOICE : Glenwood and Eagle Crest . See ? Oh . Thank you , Clarice . Now , could you whip me up some chocolate chip cookies ? ( BEEPING ) ELECTRONIC VOICE : You have arrived at your destination . Help ! Help , he 's crazy ! Let me guess . A rogue tornado came out of nowhere ? Yeah . Threw the truck around and knocked me out . Next thing I know , some stupid kid is handcuffing me to this railing . Where is he ? In there . He 's wasting his time . It 's an armored truck with a time lock . He 'll never break in . ( GLASS SHATTERING ) Yeah , keep telling yourself that . Just ... Okay , you just just stay here . Oh , okay . Whoa . ( CRACKLING ) ( RUMBLING ) MYKA : Jesse Ashton ? Let us see your hands . Okay , look , kid . You don 't know what you 're holding there . Really ? I think it 's a magic pipe that lets me control the weather . Okay , maybe you do . Hand it over . Jesse , listen , you don 't understand . No , you don 't understand . I 'm running out of time . I need this . Somebody could get hurt , kid . I know . It might even be you . JESSE : Heads up . Hey , is that a ... That looks like a ... Look out , Mykes ! ( SHATTERING ) ( FARNSWORTH RINGING ) ( CLATTERING ) ( COUGHING ) Ow . Oh ... Did he just drop a truck on us ? Yeah . And he 'd better be gone ! Yeah , you 'd better be gone ! Yeah , he 's gone . So , so , what , he ... Drops the armored truck , he ... He ... Cracks it open , and ... Oh , yeah . Takes all the money inside . Yeah . It 's the piggy bank principle , but on a bigger scale . Okay . There was something else going on with him , though . Did you see the bandage on his arm ? I mean , it 's kind of like the ones they use when you get your blood drawn . Right , right . And , uh , but he had that , uh , the medical book at his house . Right , the book on anatomy . Blood test . Money . He said that he was running out of time . Pete , what if Jesse 's sick ? I don 't understand . My wife 's been begging me to take her golfing . Yeah , okay , well , these clubs ... You bought these at the pawn shop downtown ? I wasn 't gonna get her a new set of Callaways . I want her to hate it . Golf is my hobby . It 's my time to hang out with the guys . And somebody 's supposed to stay home and do the cooking and the cleaning ? No ... She 's a terrible cook . I wonder why she hit you ? Okay , so where is the 9 iron ? What ? After she whacked me with it ? No idea . Okay , as long as she 's got that 9 iron , the slightest annoyance is gonna magnify into a furious rage . My guess is she 's taken a divot out of one of your hangout buddies . Where would they be right now ? Oh , hey , Janet . Where 's Hank ? We 're gonna miss our tee time . ( THUDS ) Janet , what the hell ? Every single weekend with you idiots , and the Christmas lights are still up ! ( WHISPERING ) What do you need ? Hey , Claud , look . Myka needs the ... Psst ! Quietly . ( WHISPERING ) Myka needs the 32-bit decryption code thingy to access the hospital records . Yeah , got it . Emailing now . Why are we whispering ? Because of the killer birds . ( SQUAWKING ) ( SQUAWKING ) ( WHISPERING ) Right ... See ya . So sorry . Won 't take a sec . Yeah , no rush . At least now we know what the bird cage does . Okay . The Prius is backed up to the door . On my count , you toss me the cage , we sprint for the neutralizer tank in the trunk . Easy peasy . What about Woodstock and Tweety and all their friends ? ( SQUAWKING ) He 's got his eyes on my eyes . Yeah . Did you not hear me say sprint ? Okay , one , two ... Oh , this counts as my point in the scavenger hunt , right ? Oh , yeah . Three ! ( SQUAWKING ) Oh , ah . God , they got me . Where ? Ah , right there . I don 't see anything . Are you sure ? Yeah , there 's not a scratch . You 're okay . Oh , God , no . This is karma for playing too much Angry Birds . God , I can feel it . Ow . ( SMASHING ) We were supposed to go to the flower show . But no ! " I can 't , dear . " I 've got to spend eight hours getting drunk with my buddies ! " Janet , please ! Put that club down ! No . Artie , be careful . With that iron she could kill somebody . Oh , no , I can handle her . Whoa ! ( GRUNTS ) ( CRACKLING ) Oh , look , there 's Hank . ( GROWLING ) Where ? ( CRACKLING ) All right , get the neutralizer from my bag . Get the neutralizer now ! Artie , just toss me the club . What ? Just hand it over ? Sure , that 's what everybody wants . I do all the work ! And nobody knows . I 'm the one who risked everything . Who was asked to sacrifice everything that he loved ! And I can 't even tell anyone that I saved them . ( SCREAMS ) Oh , thanks . Uh , some bad juju on that club . Artie , what was that about ? What was what about ? What you just said . Said about what ? I don 't know . Artie , your anger was stemming from something very ... Nothing . What ? I 'm always angry . That 's my raison d 'etre . Ask anybody . Grumble , grumble . Let 's go ! ( BEEPING ) ( KNOCK AT DOOR ) Mrs. Ashton . Did you find Jesse ? No . We , um , we tracked Jesse 's medical records , thinking he had some sort of blood test , but we found out that he 's been making donations to a , um ... Ronald Ashton . For Ronnie . His little brother . And ... And that would be Ronnie ? Yes . I knew it . We 'd been getting donations anonymously . They have a rare blood type . Deep down , I knew it . You see , Jesse 's not a bad person . He 's always loved his little brother . Mrs. Ashton , what ... What happened to Ronnie ? Heart infection . Myocarditis . He 's taken a bad turn these past few days . Uh-huh . Is that why Jesse 's robbing banks ? He 's what ? Oh , my God . Jesse 's obviously trying to help , but , um ... People are getting hurt . Oh , we 've been drowning in bills , but ... Oh , Jesse , what are you doing ? Who are you ? What are you doing in my office ? My brother , Ronnie Ashton . The doctors said that he needed surgery . I mean , we can pay for it now , okay ? Money isn 't the only issue . That is bull ! You and the insurance guys and that stupid bank have been bleeding my mom dry since Ronnie got sick . Look , with his condition , we need to find a suitable donor . Even then , there are ... There are dozens of other factors . I ... I don 't care about other factors . I can get you all the money you need . Just fix my brother . It 's more complicated than that . Then maybe I need to simplify it for you . MYKA : Mrs. Ashton , we need to find Jesse . Do you have any idea ? He 's here , Mykes . What ? Jesse . He 's in the hospital . ( THUNDER BREAKS ) ( LIGHTNING CRACKLES ) ( RUMBLING ) Pete , the roof . There 's a storm forming over the roof . Whoo ! Whoo ! Now you see what I can do ? Ahhh ! ( AIR WHOOSHING ) Ahhh ! You shoot lightning , too ? That 's our thing ! Why won 't you two leave me alone ? Jesse , listen to me . We know why you 're doing this . Okay , we know about your brother ! Then make them do it ! I can pay for it . Ronnie cannot die . Yeah , but other people will if you don 't give us that pipe ! No . No ! I 'm in control now . For once . Screw other people . You tell them that they got one hour to start fixing Ronnie , or I turn this hospital into a pile of rocks . No ! MYKA : Ahhh ! ( BEEPS ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) Look , you need to get everyone into the basement , all right ? I can 't fit an entire hospital full of patients into the basement . Can 't you stop him ? Look , I 'm not a big fan of " give the terrorist what he wants , " but wouldn 't it be easier to just give his brother the surgery ? I tried to tell him . Ronnie 's myocarditis is too advanced . He needs a heart transplant . All right , so just pop a new ticker into the kid . They do it every day . Pete , finding a compatible donor heart is very difficult and specific . No , I know , I ... We thought we had one last week , but the organ wasn 't viable . We 're still looking , but the odds of finding a compatible heart in the time that Ronnie has now are ... ( THUNDER BREAKS ) Are not good . I get it . I 'll talk to security about evacuation . Hey . Hey . Hey . There is a storm on the roof . What did we miss ? Yeah , well , Jesse 's up there , and if the hospital doesn 't give his brother a heart transplant in the next hour , he 's gonna level the place . So we missed a lot . We have to get up there and stop him . The trouble is , we just tried that , and he just blew us off . Uh , and I don 't mean he was being rude , I mean he literally blew us off the roof . There 's got to be some way to get the drop on him . CLAUDIA : Actually , it 's a little not by the manual , and Artie would be pissed , but we may have a solution . Jesse ! Look , I 'm unarmed . Okay , I , I don 't want to hurt you , I just ... I just want to talk . Have they started the surgery yet ? They will . Okay , they 're looking as hard as they can for ... For a ... Ahhh ! That 's close enough . Jesse , they need more time . No ! You 've seen him ! He 's out of time . Look , what about everyone else ? Okay , what about the other patients downstairs ? I don 't care . JESSE : He 's my little brother . ( SIGHING ) I don 't understand . I got the money . Why won 't they help him ? Now you see me ... PETE : Now , you don 't . JESSE : Listen , Ronnie 's a good kid , okay ? He never did anything wrong . He 's ... He 's smart , he 's funny , he 's got a future , okay ? And I 'm not gonna let some crappy , greedy hospital take that from him . Who 's there ? ( AIR WHOOSHING ) You can see me , can 't you ? Get away from me . Ahhh . ( GROANS ) Pete ! I 'm getting the feeling we 're near the edge here , right ? It 's over , Jesse . Don 't make me shoot you . ( PANTING ) Why won 't they help him ? They don 't have a compatible heart . The donor needs to be a perfect match . We 're sorry , man . Okay , just ... There 's nothing anyone can do . Okay . I understand . JESSE : Tell Ronnie ... I 'm sorry . I wish I was a better brother . I wasn 't ever there for him . Now I can be . Jesse , no ! Jesse , wait ! ( GUNSHOT ) ( LIGHTNING CRACKLES ) What is it ? Mykes ! Mykes , Mykes , what happened ? Myka ! Pete . He 's ... He 's dead . Is it over ? Yeah . MYKA : Mrs. Garner , Jesse 's a compatible donor , right ? I mean , he 's a match for his brother Ronnie ? Get a gurney . And page Dr. Gellar . I 'll notify the OR to get ready for an organ transplant . We couldn 't save him , Pete . He got what he wanted , Mykes . He saved his brother after all . Ow , ow , ow , ow . Ow ! You 're such a wimp . Well , you know , it hurts . ( CHUCKLING ) Ooh . Naughty . Hey , uh , that nurse was hot , right ? Still having vision issues ? A little blurry . She was totally your type . I 'll give her your number . Schwing . So , how 's Ronnie ? Well , he 's still in surgery , but the heart 's a perfect match , so ... They think it 'll work . I just can 't stop thinking about what Jesse did . You know , giving his brother a second chance like that . Yeah , the things we do for family , huh ? Yeah . Well , now we can finally dot the " l " s on the end of Walter Sykes . Thank God . Oh , and hey , let 's never mention Dr. Evil 's name again , shall we ? Deal ! Where 's Artie and Leena ? Already on their way back to the Warehouse with the booty . Well , who 's hungry ? You are . At all times . Oh , there 's this great diner in town . We snagged Maurice Vermersch 's waffle iron there earlier today . Makes the greatest waffles in the world . Ooh , what 's the downside ? You can 't have just one . No , actually it makes your skin melt . Ooh , well , ( ROBOTIC VOICE ) Pete love waffles . Oh , Myka . Can you tell me something ? Do I have a scratch on my neck ? MYKA : Where ? CLAUDIA : Right there . MYKA : I don 't see anything . You 're fine . Really ? That is so weird . Yeah . Ow ! ( WHISPERING ) God , what now ? ( FOOTSTEPS ) ( SIGHING ) Okay . I put the clubs next to Buddy Rich 's drums . The two energies should cancel each other out . As long as Pete can 't find them the next time he decides to build a putt putt course in the Ovoid Quarantine . Uh , Artie , about what you said when you were under the influence of the club . Oh , yeah , I told you , it was nothing . It was just the idle rantings of a crazy old Warehouse agent . I 've known you a long time , Arthur Nielsen . ( THUDS ) And ever since Sykes ' attack , I 've been seeing something different . And you don 't have to tell me , okay , but whatever burden you 're carrying , please ... Don 't carry it alone . ( KISSES ) Hello . Yes , it 's Arthur . Yes , I 'm at the Warehouse . Where else would I be ? Uh , listen . There 's something that I need ... Done . And for various reasons , I can 't tell Pete or Myka . Or anybody . Not yet . Something I need done completely off the books . ( WOOFS ) Not a word . ( GROANS ) Hmm ? Um , no one . Uh , yes , good . All right , good , I 'll send you the information . Yeah . Well , it 's , uh ... I want you to find ... A certain artifact before it finds me .

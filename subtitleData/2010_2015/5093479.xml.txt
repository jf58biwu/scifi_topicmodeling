YEAH , I TOOK SOME TODAY . - IT 'S FADING THOUGH . - THE EFFECTS DON 'T LAST THAT LONG ? THE SIDE EFFECTS DON 'T LAST THAT LONG . THE EFFECTS WILL LAST THE REST OF MY LIFE , I THINK . David 's voice : MAYBE LONGER . WOW . OKAY , SO- - SO WAIT A MINUTE . THE KIDS THAT DIED- - THAT WAS THAT RAVE OVERDOSE , WASN 'T IT ? I REMEMBER ALL THAT- - A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO , SEEING THAT ON THE NEWS . I THOUGHT THEY GOT AHOLD OF SOME TAINTED ECSTASY OR SOMETHING . - YOU 'RE THE GUY- - - SOMETHING LIKE THAT . OKAY , SO IF I CONTACT THIS ... DETECTIVE APPLETON , HE 'LL REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU ? ( chuckles ) GOOD LUCK FINDING HIM . SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ? HUH , WELL ... I THINK YOU 'VE GOT A BOOK HERE , PROBABLY , IF YOU FLESH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT . A BOOK ? MEANING A WORK OF FICTION ? MEANING IT 'S ALL BULLSHIT ? HEY , A STORY 'S A STORY . I 'M JUST A FEATURE REPORTER , SO THE FACT THAT YOU THINK IT HAPPENED IS MY STORY . YOU KNOW , I DON 'T REMEMBER LEAVING THE HOUSE WITH ANY COINS IN MY POCKET . I THINK YOU COULD 'VE SLIPPED THEM TO ME . WITHOUT YOU FEELING IT ? AND THE THING WITH THE DREAM ? COME ON , ARNIE . I THINK YOU 'RE TRYING TO BE ONE OF THOSE- - ( laughs ) ONE OF THOSE MENTALISTS , LIKE THAT DR. MARCONI ON TV . ( scoffs ) DR. MARCONI MAY BE THEATRICAL , BUT BELIEVE ME , HE 'S NOT AN ACT . WELL , I CAUGHT MARCONI 'S ACT IN VEGAS , AND YOUR STORY SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF THE SAME KIND OF HOCUS-POCUS TO ME . COME WITH ME . I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING . - WHERE ARE WE GOING ? - JUST OUT TO MY TRUCK . - ( curtain rattles ) - ALL RIGHT . ( clicks ) - ( distant barking ) - YOU SEE IT ? NO . OR , YOU KNOW , IT 'S AN EMPTY CAGE . TURN YOUR HEAD SO YOU 'RE LOOKING AT ME . YUP . ( sighs ) NOW YOU SHOULD SEE THE BOX JUST OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE . LET 'S GO BACK INSIDE . YOUR STORY WAS MORE INTERESTING . YOU 'RE GONNA DIE , ARNIE . SOMEDAY YOU WILL FACE THAT MOMENT . AND AT THAT MOMENT YOU WILL FACE EITHER COMPLETE NONEXISTENCE OR YOU WILL FACE SOMETHING EVEN STRANGER . ON AN ACTUAL DAY IN THE FUTURE , ARNIE , YOU WILL BE IN THE UNIMAGINABLE . IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID IT . THINK ABOUT THAT . NOW , WITHOUT TURNING YOUR HEAD , LOOK AT THE BOX . ( screeching ) AH ! SHIT ! ( gasps ) OH SHIT SHIT ! SHIT ! WHAT THE SHIT IS THAT ? ( panting ) WAIT A MINUTE . HOW THE FUCK DID YOU DO THAT ? WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING ? WHAT THE FUCK , MAN ? THERE 'S NO NAME FOR IT IN THIS WORLD . IT 'S PRETTY FREAKY THOUGH , RIGHT ? WAIT . NO NO NO NO . YOU- - YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING . YOU MADE ME SEE SOMETHING OUT OF MY OWN HEAD . YOU FREAKED ME OUT SO THAT I WOULD SEE SOMETHING . NO , IT 'S REALLY THERE . I 'M SURPRISED YOU SAW IT SO EASILY THOUGH . YOU MUST HAVE AN OPEN MIND . MOST PEOPLE ONLY SEE IT THAT FAST IF THEY 'RE STONED OR DRUNK . ( chuckles ) I WANT TO TELL THE REST OF MY STORY , ARNIE . I NEED TO . I NEED TO GET IT OUT . BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS- - - THE TRUTH . - OKAY . UNTIL I FIGURE IT OUT FOR REAL . ( chuckles ) OKAY . EH , THAT 'LL HAVE TO DO . ( clangs ) COME ON . ANYWAY , SO THE COP COMES IN , TELLS ME THAT JOHN IS DEAD . YOUR FRIEND ... HE 'S DEAD . WHAT ? HOW ? - ( panting ) - CALM DOWN . CALM DOWN . HE WENT INTO CONVULSIONS OR SOMETHING . HIS PULSE STOPPED . WE 'VE GOT AMBULANCES . ONE WILL BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS . WE 'VE GOT VINNIE DOING C.P.R. ON HIM . VINNIE IS A LIFEGUARD IN HIS OFF HOURS . NOW YOU LISTEN TO ME , BOY . HERE 'S WHAT YOU 'RE GONNA DO . I 'LL BE BACK IN FIVE MINUTES AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA TELL ME THE TRUTH . AND IF YOU OBSTRUCT ME IN ANY WAY , YOU 'RE GONNA LIVE THE REST OF YOUR DAYS WISHING YOU HAD NOT . - ( door closes ) - ( cellphone ringing ) ( clicks , beeps ) YEAH ? Dave , this is John . WHAT ? DID YOU GET OUT ? Yes and no . Are you still at the police station ? YEAH , WE WERE- - WE WERE BOTH- - Have I died yet ? Dave , can you hear me ? UMM , YEAH . I , UH- - EVERYONE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM . THEY SAID YOU HAD- - No no , there 's no time to explain all this right now . Look , leave the police station right now during all the commotion . They 'll have EMTs hauling my body out , lots of people will be standing around looking . Just walk out . Don 't run . That 'll attract attention . Just calmly walk out like your business is done there . Also , is there any way that you can steal my body ? - WHAT ? ! - No , probably not . Okay , never mind . We 'll have to work around that . Okay , have you reached the sidewalk yet ? NO , I 'M STILL STANDING IN THE ROOM . I CAN 'T LEAVE . THERE 'S STILL A GUY IN HERE WITH ME . ANOTHER COP . No , there 's not . Check the mirror . I DON 'T GET IT . He 's not real , Dave . Well , not in the traditional sense . Just go . Just walk out . Okay , you 're gonna start seeing things like this from time to time . It 's important that you not freak out . SO , UH ... HE CAN 'T HURT ME , RIGHT ? Oh , I 'm pretty sure he can . ( grunting ) ( chittering ) ( choking ) ( flapping , cawing ) - ( chomps ) - AH ! AH ! AH ! ( both grunting ) ( screams ) ( grunts ) ( groaning ) ( chokes ) ( slams ) ( birds chirping ) ( door closes ) ( cellphone rings , beeps ) John : Dave , it 's me . Where are you right now ? I 'M ON THE SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE COP SHOP , WALKING . WHERE ARE YOU ? HEAVEN ? When you hear a song on the radio , where is the song ? WHAT ? - WH- - WHAT , JOHN ? - Just keep walking . Just go toward the park . - And don 't freak out . Are you freaking out ? - I DON 'T KNOW . I CAN 'T BELIEVE THIS PHONE STILL WORKS . There 's a hot dog guy about maybe a half a block ahead . Do you see him ? ( rock music playing on radio ) - OKAY . - Buy a bratwurst from him . ( sighs ) ONE . OKAY , I HAVE THE BRATWURST . Put it up to your head . GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU WHY , JOHN . I have to show you something . Dave . Dave , can you hear me ? ALL RIGHT , ALL RIGHT , I GET IT . YEAH , I CAN HEAR YOU THROUGH SOME KIND OF PSYCHIC VIBRATION OR WHATEVER AND NOT THE PHONE . OKAY , I GET IT . OKAY ? - COULD 'VE JUST TOLD ME THAT . - The only reason that you can hear me is because you have some of the Soy Sauce in your system from the syringe . But it 's not very much and it 's not gonna last very long . WHAT IS THAT STUFF , JOHN ? THE SAUCE- - IT WAS ALIVE . - I SWEAR . - Listen , you 've got to get over to Robert 's place . There aren 't any cops there right now , but there will be . We 've got sort of a narrow window here , so you 've got to take a cab to Wally 's , get your car and then go to Wayside Village on Lathrop Avenue . - It 's a trailer park south of town . - I DON 'T HAVE ANY CASH . I HAD $ 5 . I JUST SPENT THREE OF IT ON THE BRATWURST . That bratwurst cost $ 3 ? Holy crap . Okay . All right , give me a second . Okay , check between the sausage and the bun . You should find a $ 100 bill rolled up in there . THERE 'S NO MONEY IN THE BRATWURST . IT 'S JUST A PIECE OF LETTUCE . Okay . You have your ATM card ? ( cellphone ringing ) - JOHN . - Dave ! - YEAH . - ( distorted ) What ? Did you just drive under a bridge or something ? NO , I 'M AT THE TRAILER PARK . WHICH ONE 'S ROBERT 'S ? Oh , it 's wearing off . Okay , don 't talk , just listen . Go inside ... ( static ) And as long as you absolutely remember - not to do that you 'll be fine . Good luck . - ( beeps ) OH , WAIT WAIT WAIT , JOHN . JOHN , I DIDN 'T GET THE- - HELLO ? THIS LOOKS LIKE THE PLACE . - ( engine stops ) - ( buckle clicks ) - ( barks ) - STAY IN THE CAR . - ( creaks ) - ( static ) - ( static ) - ( snoring ) ( snoring continues ) - ( gasping ) - ( bangs ) - ( rattles ) - ( creaks ) ( gasps ) ( hissing ) OH SHIT . ( rattling ) ( hisses , bangs ) David 's voice : YOU KNOW WHAT 'S IN THERE , RIGHT ? WE KNOW ROBERT HAD A STASH OF THE SHIT . HEY , MAN ! YOU OWE ME A BEER , MAN ! AND IF HE HAD A STASH , HE COULDN 'T JUST CRAM IT UNDER HIS BED . THAT BLACK SHIT MOVES , IT HAS A WILL , AN ATTITUDE . IT BITES . AND THEN I REALIZED ALL AT ONCE WHAT I HAD COME HERE FOR . WHEN I WAS ONE THE STUFF- - THAT LITTLE HIT IN MY THIGH- - I COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD , WITH JOHN . WHEN IT WORE OFF I COULD NOT . MY ONE CHANCE TO SAVE JOHN LAY INSIDE THIS BOTTLE . IT WAS DECIDED THEN , JUST LIKE THAT . - ( chittering ) - UGH . ( buzzes ) ( gulps , gags ) ( Dave 's voice screaming ) OH , SON OF A MOTHERFUCK ! THE FUCKING SOY SAUCE IS DIGGING A FUCKING HOLE IN MY FUCKING FACE ! I 'LL THROW MYSELF AT THE COP AND BEG HIM TO TAKE ME TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO PUMP MY STOMACH , TO BRING IN AN EXORCIST , TO CALL IN THE AIR FORCE TO NUKE THIS WHOLE TOWN INTO RADIOACTIVE DUST AND BURY IT UNDER 60 ' OF CONCRETE ! ( normal tone ) AND THEN ... CALM . ALMOST ZEN . THAT 'S WHAT CAME NEXT , THAT SOY SAUCE FEELING . I WANTED TO RUN , TO DUCK , TO ACT , BUT THE BODY IS A SLOW , WET MECHANISM OF MUSCLE AND BONE THAT CREEPED EVEN AS MY MIND FLEW . AND SO JUST LIKE THAT , I STEPPED OUTSIDE OF IT . I HAD A FULL 1.78 SECONDS BEFORE THE DETECTIVE WOULD STEP THROUGH THE DOOR . A SUPERCOMPUTER CAN DO OVER A TRILLION MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS IN ONE SECOND . TO THAT MACHINE , ONE SECOND IS AN ETERNITY . OKAY , THINK . YOU 'RE STANDING ON THE THIN COOL CRUST OF A GIGANTIC BALL OF MOLTEN ROCK HURTLING THROUGH FROZEN SPACE . YOU 'RE IN A SITUATION THAT COULD THREATEN THE NATURE OF SAID EXISTENCE ON SAID MOLTEN BALL , DEPENDING ON WHICH DECISION YOU MAKE . BUT WAIT . THERE ARE A SHITLOAD OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES IN THE UNIVERSE , EACH SET INTO OUTWARD MOTION AT THE MOMENT OF THE BIG BANG . THUS WHETHER OR NOT YOU MOVE YOUR RIGHT ARM NOW OR NOD YOUR HEAD OR CHOOSE TO EAT FRUITY PEBBLES OR CORN FLAKES NEXT THURSDAY MORNING WAS ALL DECIDED AT THE MOMENT THE UNIVERSE CRASHED INTO EXISTENCE 17 BILLION YEARS AGO . THUS IT IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO DEVIATE- - I NEVER FINISHED THIS THOUGHT , AS I SUDDENLY REALIZED I WAS NO LONGER IN THE TRAILER . ( wind blowing ) WAS I DEAD ? ( clinking ) ( buzzer sounds ) UH , EXCUSE ME . ( echoes ) SO ... I ... SUPPOSE YOU 'RE WONDERING WHY I 'M HERE . SAME AS EVERYBODY . YOU 'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IN THE NAME OF ELVIS IS GOING ON . EVERYBODY EXCEPT ME . ME- - I DON 'T EVEN WANNA KNOW ANYMORE . I SUPPOSE YOU 'RE WONDERING WHAT I 'M DOING WITH THIS CAN OF GASOLINE ? OH , THANKS . I FELL ... ON A DRILL . ( gas sloshes ) ( lid clinks ) - ( cocks ) - OH ! YOU LEAVING ALREADY ? HERE , HELP ME . I 'LL BE GLAD TO , BUT FIRST I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FRIEND JOHN . WELL , HE 'S GONE , YOU KNOW THAT , RIGHT ? MEANING ? HE 'S JUST GONE . YOU KNOW A KID NAMED JUSTIN WHITE , MR. WONG ? - HIGH SCHOOL KID ? - YOU ASKED ME THAT BACK AT THE STATION . I REMEMBER NOW . HE 'S THAT KID- - KINDA TALKS LIKE A JUNIOR GANGSTER . HE 'S ONE OF THE MISSING , RIGHT ? WELL , HE 'S THE GUY WHO CALLED IN THE- - THE WHATEVER HAPPENED HERE- - ABOUT 4 : 00 IN THE MORNING . ( sirens blaring ) Girl : GET IN ! GO GO GO GO GO GO ! ( tires screech ) - ( boy whimpers ) - ( girl # 2 moaning ) Boy # 2 : OH ! ( chittering ) ( Justin groaning ) SHIT . Appleton : I THOUGHT HE WAS STABBED IN THE GUT OR SOMETHING . I LOOKED CLOSER AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ON JUSTIN- - HIS ARMS AND HIS FACE . - AND THIS STUFF , IT 'S ALIVE . - ( Justin sobs ) STAY BACK , STEVE . I GOT THIS . YO , WHAT UP , 5-0 ? SO YOU 'RE STILL GONNA BURN THIS PLACE DOWN ? THAT 'S RIGHT . AND YOU 'RE NOT GONNA LET ME GO . SO YOU UNDERSTAND MY MOOD , UNDERSTAND WHY I 'M OUT HERE COMMITTING FELONIES TODAY , THERE ARE SOME VERY DARK THINGS HAPPENING AND I 'VE GOT THIS LONELY FEELING LIKE I 'M THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS , THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . EVERYBODY 'S GOT A GHOST STORY , U.F.O. OR A BIGFOOT STORY- - NO . YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ? I THINK STUFF IS BOTH REAL AND NOT REAL AT THE SAME TIME . I 'M NOT A STAR TREK FAN . I DON 'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT OTHER DIMENSIONS AND ALL THAT . I 'M AN OLD SCHOOL CATHOLIC . I BELIEVE IN HELL . I BELIEVE THAT IT 'S MORE THAN JUST MURDERERS AND RAPISTS DOWN THERE . I BELIEVE IN DEMONS AND WORMS- - VILE SHIT IN THE GREASE TRAP OF THE UNIVERSE . AND THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT , THE MORE I THINK THAT IT 'S NOT JUST SOMEPLACE DOWN THERE . OH NO , THAT IT 'S RIGHT HERE WITH US . WE JUST CAN 'T PERCEIVE IT . IT 'S KINDA LIKE THE COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO STATION . IT 'S OUT THERE IN THE AIR EVEN IF YOU DON 'T TUNE INTO IT . AND I THINK THAT SOMEHOW THROUGH CHEMISTRY OR MAGIC OR VOODOO- - THAT JAMAICAN SON OF A BITCH , HE TUNED IN TO IT , INTO HELL ITSELF . THROUGH THAT , HE OPENED A DOOR . HE BECAME THE DOOR . AND ME ? I INTEND TO CLOSE IT . ( machinery clanking ) UH , EXCUSE ME . ( echoes ) ( fly buzzing ) ( squishes ) - ( grunts ) - ( bullet clatters ) ( fire crackling ) ( coughing ) ( engine revving ) ( tires screech ) - ( crashes ) - ( grunts ) ( engine idling ) ( coughing ) - ( woofs ) - MOVE . - ( sounds reverberating ) - ( Bark Lee panting ) ( John clears throat ) ( distorted ) Oh ! David ! You understand me ? This is John . UH ... HELLO . - We 're in big fucking trouble , Dave . - YEAH , NO SHIT , FLUFFY . Oh , you can hear me , so I guess you took the Soy Sauce . Why ? Didn 't I tell you not to ? And what happened to your face ? YOUR SECOND QUESTION ANSWERS YOUR FIRST . John : Here 's what I know : there are two people still alive from last night other than me , Fred Chu and your girlfriend Amy . WAIT . YOU 'RE WITH AMY ? AND WHO 'S GOT YOU ? Justin White- - or that thing that used to be Justin . UH , THAT 'S FOUR STILL ALIVE , INCLUDING JUSTIN . There 's nothing left of Justin inside of him now . Couple of days , Justin 's gonna hatch just like that Jamaican did . Anybody in the vicinity when that happens will become a spawning pod thing . Dave , the last world that saw these things was saturated within 100 days . And don 't ask me how I know that either , because I don 't know . OKAY , I GOT ANOTHER QUESTION . EVERYONE WHO TOOK THE SOY SAUCE IS EITHER DEAD OR COMATOSE EXCEPT FOR ME . Probably able to adjust . But you should have figured out by now , Dave , you don 't choose the Soy Sauce . The Soy Sauce chooses you . The Soy Sauce chooses you . If it can 't use you , it kills you . From what I hear , it plays with you first . ( barks ) ( raspy breathing ) JUSTIN ? ( groans ) ( raspy ) YO , YOU NEED TO COME ROLL WITH ME , DUDE . WHERE , UH- - WHERE WE GOING , JUSTIN ? WHY YOU FRONTING , BRO ? YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS . STOP CALLING ME JUSTIN LIKE NOTHING 'S CHANGED , YO . WHAT SHOULD I CALL YOU , HOMEY ? JUST CALL ME SHITLOAD , BECAUSE THERE 'S A SHITLOAD OF US IN HERE , YO . DUDE , I KNOW YOU STRAPPED , - BUT BEFORE YOU THINK ABOUT ... - ( gun cocks ) ... FLASHING THAT NINE ON ME , YO , YOU BETTER LISTEN TO WHAT I 'S GOTS TO SAY . ( clicks ) ( groans ) AS I WAS SAYING , YO ... GONNA LISTEN TO ME , DUDE ? I 'VE- - I 'M LISTENING , SHITLOAD . WE TAKING A RIDE . YEAH , I DON 'T THINK THAT 'S GONNA HAPPEN . ( grunts ) ( groans ) - ( truck rattling ) - OH MY GOD , MY BALLS . HEY HEY . WE HEARD THE GUNFIRE . - ARE YOU THE ONE THAT SHOT HIM ? - ( groans ) - I SAW HIS HEAD . - I WAS AIMING FOR HIS HEART - BUT YEAH , I DID GET HIM . - Amy : GOOD . AMY ? DO YOU THINK HE CAN BE KILLED ? David : LOOK , I DON 'T KNOW . Amy : HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT AN OLD MALL . THE MALL OF THE DEAD . WHY THERE ? David : JOHN ? HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN LIKE THIS ? DOES HE EVER SAY ANYTHING ? HE MUMBLES . BEEN LIKE THAT EVER SINCE THEY BROUGHT HIM IN . WAKE UP ! COME ON , WAKE UP , ASSHOLE . HEY . UH , I FOUND YOUR DOG . I KNOW . THANKS . ( whines ) LISTEN , I 'M GONNA GET US OUT OF THIS . DON 'T WORRY . JOHN 'S GOT A PLAN . ( whines ) ( mumbles ) ( crackling ) ( grunts ) - ( Amy gasps ) - ( groans ) OOH . ( chuckles ) MAN ! WHERE ARE WE ? WE 'RE IN SOME LIQUOR TRUCK AND WE 'RE ON OUR WAY TO THE ABANDONED MALL ON HIGHWAY 59 . DID YOU SAY WE 'RE GOING TO THE MALL OR COMING BACK FROM IT ? - GOING ! - YEAH , THAT 'S RIGHT , - ' CAUSE FRED 'S STILL ALIVE . - WHAT ? ! NOTHING NOTHING . I GOT A HEADACHE . YOU SEE THAT DOOR ? I SEE IT . ( chitters ) YO , SHE 'LL BE ABLE TO WALK UP OUTTA HERE IF Y 'ALL COOPERATE . I NEED HER TO OPEN THE GHOST DOOR , YO . BUT IF YOU GIVE ME STATIC OR TRY TO PLAY THE MOTHERFUCKING FOOL , AS SOON AS SHE DONE WHAT I NEED , I 'M GONNA MAKE YOU- - - HEY ! - ( John panting ) YO , WHAT 'S OUT THERE ? A WEAPON ? YOU TRYING TO GANK ME , FOOL ? ( shotgun cocks , fires ) ( Amy gasps ) ( gurgles ) ( match strikes , flares ) ( exhales sharply ) I GUESS THERE 'S NO GETTING RID OF YOU . ( shotgun cocks ) ANY MORE OF THEM ? NO , I DON 'T THINK SO . THEN COME ON- - ALL OF YOU . LET 'S GET TO MY CAR . OKAY , SO THOSE WHITE THINGS THAT YOU SAW TAKE OVER JUSTIN- - THEY 'RE LOOKING FOR HOSTS , OKAY ? NOW , UH , THERE WAS A DRUG THAT THE GUY , THE ONE WHO EXPLODED , HE HAD IT IN HIS TRAILER- - THAT STUFF IS BLACK , RIGHT ? OH . YOU 'RE , UH- - YOU 'RE FAMILIAR WITH IT ? SOUNDS LIKE YOU AND I BOTH GOT LONG STORIES TO TELL . I 'VE BEEN UP 48 HOURS STRAIGHT - AND THIS CASE AIN 'T GETTING NO CLEARER . - ( engine starts ) IT 'S THE ADRENALINE- - IT KEEPS ME GOING . YEAH . THAT AND THOSE ... PIERCING VOICES IN MY HEAD . WAIT . WHAT KIND OF VOICES ? UH ... ( grunts ) - ( grunts ) - ( screaming ) - ( chittering ) - OH FUCK ! - John : AH , COME ON ! - OH !

COME ON ! - ( both grunt ) - GET HIM OVER HERE . - GET BACK ! OKAY . - ( cocks ) ( screeching ) ( panting ) JOHN , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? MY WEAPONS . I 'M NOT GONNA STAND BY WHILE SOME WHITE FUZZ FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION INVADES OUR WORLD AND INFECTS EVERY LAST MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD . WE 'RE GONNA GO THROUGH THAT GHOST DOOR AND CLEAN HOUSE . WHAT ? I WENT WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT . OKAY . WHY ? 'CAUSE WE 'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN . 'CAUSE WE WERE CHOSEN ... BY THE SOY SAUCE . - ARE YOU IN ? - ( sighs ) YEAH , I GUESS . IS THAT A PAINTBALL GUN ? ( squeaks , hisses ) ( chuckles ) John : GHOST DOOR- - YOU SEE IT ? YEAH . - ALL I SEE IS A WALL . - ( rustles ) ( whimpers ) OH , COOL . SHIT . IT 'S A GHOST KNOB . - David : THIS JUST DOESN 'T MAKE ANY SENSE . - John : NUH-UH . 'CAUSE JUSTIN- - OR SHITLOAD OR WHATEVER HIS NAME WAS- - HE SAID HE NEEDED AMY TO OPEN IT . ( pops ) ( gasps ) ( clicking ) ( clangs ) ( scrapes ) ( humphs , pants ) - ( grates ) - ( gasps ) HEY ! AMY ! ( footsteps ) OH , I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS TO ASK - BUT NO TIME TO ASK THEM . - THAT 'S HIM , THAT 'S THE GUY- - THE ONE IN MY TRUCK WITH THE SLUG LAST NIGHT . OKAY , SLUG MAN , CAN YOU TELL US JUST WHAT THE FUCK THIS PLACE IS ? WELL , WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE LOOKING AT THERE ? YOU 'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT MY FIST AND THEN DAVE 'S DICK IF YOU DON 'T FUCKING TELL US WHAT THIS IS ! THE OTHERS HAVE DEVOTED MORE TIME AND RESOURCES THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE TO DEVELOPING AN ABILITY TO PASS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE NEXT WITH NO SUCCESS . BUT NOW WE REALIZE THAT YOU , - AND JOHN HERE , APPARENTLY CAN . - WHO 'S " WE " ? OH , I HAVE ENLISTED AN ALLY FROM YOUR WORLD . THIS GUY ? YOU TRUSTED THIS GUY ? HE 'S JUST AN INFOMERCIAL DUDE . HEY , DON 'T BE SO HASTY , DAVE . DR. MARCONI BRINGS A LOT TO THE TABLE . THANK YOU , JOHN . YOU 'RE A GENTLEMAN . THE SOURCE OF THE CURRENT MANIFESTATION IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS PORTAL . THE ENTITY 'S NAME IS KORROK . AND WHAT DOES THIS KORROK LOOK LIKE , EXACTLY ? YOU WILL KNOW HIM WHEN YOU SEE HIM . BELIEVE ME . - ( chuckles ) - HE CANNOT BE DESTROYED BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS , BUT I HAVE A PLAN . LADIES . IT IS CALLED THE TRIPPER . AND IT CAME FROM WHERE , EXACTLY ? THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL COLD WAR WEAPON DESIGNED TO TAKE DOWN A CITY THE SIZE OF MOSCOW . CONTAINED WITHIN THIS DETONATOR IS A BLOCK OF C-4 EXPLOSIVE , SURROUNDED BY A HIGHLY-POTENT MILITARY-GRADE HALLUCINOGEN . IF YOU GET THE OPPORTUNITY , - YOU MAY DETONATE IT LIKE THIS . - ( clicks ) NOW THE TRIPPER MAY NOT KILL KORROK , BUT IT WILL SURE FUCK HIS SHIT UP . SEVERELY . ( chuckles ) WELL , I LIKE THE CONCEPT , DOCTOR . AH ! MMM . MMM . ( sighs ) FINE . HOW DO WE GET IN ? JUST DECIDE THAT YOU WANT TO AND YOU WILL . ( warbles ) - ( portal zaps ) - ( grunts ) - ( portal zaps ) - ( barks ) ( portal zaps ) AH . WE MUST BE IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND . APPARENTLY IT 'S " EYES WIDE SHUT " WORLD . GENTLEMEN , WELCOME ! AS YOU CAN SEE , A SELECT FEW INTERESTED PARTIES WERE ALLOWED TO COME AND OBSERVE YOUR ARRIVAL . SO WE THOUGHT REMOVING THE GARMENTS WOULD LESSEN YOUR DISCOMFORT . YES . A VERY NICE TOUCH . GOOD ! COME . GENTLEMEN , WELCOME ! I THINK THEY WERE EXPECTING US . I LIKE THE LITTLE TOUCHES THOUGH . - ( whimpers ) - I SUPPOSE YOU ARE WONDERING WHERE YOU ARE . I 'M GONNA GUESS WE 'RE IN AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE OF SOME KIND . WELL , THAT IS CORRECT . TELL ME- - WHAT WAS IT LIKE PASSING THROUGH ? I WASN 'T REALLY PAYING ATTENTION . YEAH , IT REALLY WASN 'T THAT GREAT . WE HAVE BEEN AWAITING YOUR COMING . WE HAVE WORKED VERY HARD FOR MANY YEARS , SUFFERED MANY TRAGIC SETBACKS IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIND AND COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR WORLD . YOUR WORLD , YOU SEE , IS A TWIN TO OUR OWN , DUAL OFFSPRING BORN OF THE SAME LITTER . WATCH ! UP UNTIL THIS POINT , OUR HISTORIES WERE IDENTICAL . THERE WAS A MAN NAMED CYRUS ROONEY FROM TENNESSEE . IN YOUR WORLD , HE DIED AT THE AGE OF 17 , GORED TO DEATH WHILE TRYING TO CROSSBREED A BULL WITH A CLYDESDALE . IN OUR WORLD , THE MAN SURVIVED . HERE , CYRUS ROONEY WAS A GENIUS . HE CONTINUED TO EXPERIMENT IN WHAT HE CALLED BEASTIOLOGY . YES . PEOPLE FROM OUR SOUTH ARE INTO THAT AS WELL . - ( chuckles ) - YOU SEE , BY 1881 HIS GROUP HAD INSECTILE FLYING MACHINES . IN 1902 HE CREATED THE FIRST PRIMITIVE THINKING MACHINE OUT OF THE BRAIN OF A PIG . ( snorting ) YOU SEE , BY YOUR YEAR 1922 WE ALREADY HAD SELF-FEEDING , SELF-HEALING , SELF-MODIFYING COMPUTERS . IN 1926 MR. ROONEY PASSED AWAY . AND THEN SOMETHING MIRACULOUS HAPPENED TO THE GREATEST OF HIS CREATIONS . THE VERY DAY MR. ROONEY PASSED , IT BECAME SENTIENT . IT GAVE A NAME UNTO ITSELF AND EXPRESSED DESIRES AND EMOTIONS . AND FROM THAT DAY FORWARD , THIS ASTONISHING CREATURE CARRIED ON ROONEY 'S WORK AND CONFORMED ALL LIVING NATURE TO URGE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANKIND . FOR SOME , THIS PROCESS WAS EASY . OTHERS REQUIRED RE-EDUCATION . WATCH ! ( squeaks ) MAMA . - ( people shouting ) - OW ! OW ! NO ! PLEASE ! NO ! OH ! OH ! OH MY GOD ! ( grunts ) - ( chittering ) - ( people screaming ) ( screams ) TO PROCESS THE MAGNANIMITY THAT IS KORROK FOR YOUR SIMPLER MINDS , WE HAVE TRANSLATED THE FOLLOWING IMAGES INTO A FORMAT THAT WE THINK THAT YOU WILL FIND MORE FAMILIAR . I BELIEVE IN YOUR WORLD THEY 'RE CALLED CARTOONS . - ( cartoon music ) - ( people screaming ) MAMA ! ( roaring ) ( gurgles ) MAMA ! ( squeaks ) MAMA ! Largeman : THERE ARE ALWAYS THOSE WHO RESIST PROGRESS . IN OUR WORLD IT IS CONSIDERED A CRIME . ON OUR WORLD IT 'S CONSIDERED A GREATER CRIME TO UNLEASH KILLER SPIDERS ON AN UNARMED CROWD . WE CALL THAT ARACHNICIDE . BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD A THINKING MACHINE ? AN ENTITY SO POWERFUL THAT IT COULD FORESEE THE OUTCOME OF ANY ACTION ? FOLLOW ME . WE ARE ALL VERY EXCITED THAT YOU COULD JOIN US . ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I 'M THINKING ? THAT IF FRANZ KAFKA WAS HERE , - HIS HEAD WOULD EXPLODE ? - ACTUALLY , YEAH . GENTLEMEN , YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE SOMETHING VERY FEW OTHERS HAVE SEEN BEFORE YOU- - THE ULTIMATE MANIFESTATION OF CYRUS ROONEY 'S CREATION . ( clangs ) DAVE , JOHN , MEET KORROK . - ( loudly ) I AM KORROK . - ( Dave and John grunting ) ( Korrok laughs ) WELCOME . YOUR WIENER IS EVEN SMALLER IN PERSON . - Both : WHAT ? - WITH A TINY CHANGE IN YOUR BRAIN CHEMISTRY , - I COULD MAKE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER . - ( children laugh ) - WHAT DO YOU WANT ? - Korrok : NOT BIG BLACK COCKS , SO WE DON 'T HAVE THAT IN COMMON . GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HEAD ! DAVID WONG , SON OF AN INSANE PROSTITUTE AND A MENTALLY-CHALLENGED AMWAY SALESMAN . THERE ARE WORLDS UPON WORLDS , - AN INFINITY YOU CANNOT GRASP . - ... IN OUR WORLD . THEY WILL SOON BE IN YOUR WORLD TOO . 20 YEARS AGO KORROK FORETOLD YOUR COMING . HE SHOWED US THE WAY TO YOUR WORLD . WE HAVE NEVER TRAVELED FROM OUR PLANE TO YOURS . BUT WE HAVE TRIED . OH , WE HAVE TRIED . DAVE , JOHN , YOUR ARRIVAL HERE IS A NEW DAWN . YOU CAN SHOW US THE WAY TO GO FROM OUR WORLD TO YOUR OWN . YOU SEE , IN OUR WORLD , WHEN SOMEONE IS BORN WITH SPECIAL WISDOM , HE SHARES IT WITH KORROK SO THAT KORROK COULD BE GREATER . WATCH . AH ! AH ! ( screams ) - ( gasps ) - Korrok : MMM , BACON ! WE UNDERSTAND . WE ONLY HAVE THE BEST INTENTIONS . WE HAVE OBSERVED YOU AND WILL SOON MOVE INTO YOUR WORLD WITH ASTONISHING SPEED , SO THAT YOU TOO CAN KNOW THE BENEFICENCE THAT IS KORROK . ( beeping ) BUT FIRST WE HAVE TO SHARE YOUR KNOWLEDGE WITH KORROK . ( all grunting ) ( screams , thuds ) - ( growling ) - ( screams ) ( high-pitched scream ) - ( grunting ) - DAVE ! - ( screams ) - ( laughs ) ( growls ) ( screams ) - JOHN ! - ( hissing ) ( guard screams ) - ( beeps ) - ( growling continues ) ( screams ) NO ! - ( thuds ) - ( Korrok screaming ) ( guard screaming ) - ( thuds ) - ( grunts ) - ( bangs ) - DOOR ! ( beeping stops ) AW , MAN . YOU FUCKED UP - THE DETONATION SEQUENCE ! - Largeman : DAVE , JOHN . ALL OF THE HUMAN MINDS WHO HAVE EVER LIVED IN HISTORY , ALL OF YOUR THINKERS AND WRITERS AND TEACHERS AND PHILOSOPHERS COULD NOT EQUAL EVEN ONE NODE OF KORROK 'S NEURAL WEB . OUR LEGIONS ARE READY FOR THE CALL . - AND SOON ALL OF YOUR TURMOIL ... - ( beeping ) ... AND UNREST AND CONFUSION WILL VANISH UNDER THE SOFT HAND OF KORROK . - HMM ? - ( Bark Lee growls ) - HMM ? - ( beeps ) ( Korrok roars ) ( both panting ) DID BARK LEE JUST SACRIFICE HIS LIFE ? - DAMN . THAT DOG JUST SAVED THE UNIVERSE . - AMY 'S GONNA KILL ME . WE MUST HURRY . ( man yells ) MOVE . NOW ! WAIT . IF YOU COULD CROSS OVER HERE SO EASILY , WHY DIDN 'T YOU JUST DELIVER THE FREAKING BOMB ? WHY US ? WE NEEDED TO SEND SOMEONE THEY WOULD CONSIDER TOTALLY INNOCUOUS- - COMPLETELY UNABLE TO POSE A SERIOUS THREAT . BESIDES , THE DOG NEEDED AN ESCORT . YES . GOOD THINKING . Arnie : SO MARCONI SAVED THE DAY . HUH . - KORROK STILL EXISTS ? - FROM OUR WORLD , IT 'S HARD TO REALLY KNOW FOR SURE . BUT IT 'S NO SECRET THAT THERE 'S STILL STRANGE STUFF GOING DOWN IN THIS TOWN . WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL , AMY ? WHAT HAPPENED TO HER ? AMY WASN 'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT HER DOG . THE SOY SAUCE THAT THE DOG INGESTED WHEN HE BIT THE JAMAICAN GUY ALLOWED BARK LEE TO PSYCHICALLY CONNECT WITH NORTH AND MARCONI . SO THE DOG KNEW WHAT HAD TO BE DONE AND WAS WILLING TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE . AS TO AMY ... SHE 'S BEEN MY GIRLFRIEND EVER SINCE . ( birds chirping ) I GOT HER OUT OF TOWN THOUGH . SHE 'S UPSTATE AT COLLEGE . GOT A 3.7 G.P.A. GOOD FOR HER . AND JOHN ? WHAT , UH- - WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM ? HE SURVIVED TOO ? WE SHOOT HOOPS A LOT- - WHENEVER WE 'RE NOT TOO BUSY WITH , UH , WORK .

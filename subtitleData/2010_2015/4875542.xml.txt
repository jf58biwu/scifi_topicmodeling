I 've not seen you . I just went 21 last week . I wanted to go to Airdale My sister 's there , but ... It 's full , apparently . Proper fruit . It was worth the risk . The most natural thing in there 's probably grown in a Petri dish . Yeah . Quite good , though . Yeah . That 's the right way round . When you get the cheap one , you end up having to pedal it off . Then you want more sugar . Then you 're playing catch-up and I 've ... I 've been there . It 's a vicious circle . Can 't you just use that CPT app ? What 's that ? This cognitive behavioural thing . It realigns your thinking to pick healthy food . Whispers you into it while you sleep . Yeah , I should try that , yeah . I liked your singing the other day . I was trying to sing so no-one could hear me pee . I 'm not Selma or anything . You 've got a phenomenal voice . It was the most beautiful song ... Y ... You think I 'm being cheesy ? All right , I am being cheesy . But it was beautiful , so , you know ... Reality 's cheesy sometimes . Not often , admittedly , but ... Now . Yeah ... Well , thank you . It 's just noises , though . Noises in the right order . Don 't downplay ... you 're good . The song 's good . It 's old . My mum used to sing it and she learnt it from her mum . A hand-me-down . You thought of trying out for Hot Shot ? Me ? Why not ? Singing in front of Judge Hope ? I 'd die ! Seriously , I 'd be halfway to the afterlife come the chorus . No , you 'd walk it . A ) I wouldn 't . And B ) ... I don 't have that clockage . It 's , what , 12 mil just to enter ? What kind of bike time is that ? Six months ? - Yeah , but ... - I 'm hand to mouth . I know people save and stuff to get onto that stage and then there 's what Selma did . But , you know what ? - I 'd rather not give myself ... - Yeah , but I 'll gift it to you . The full 12 , I 'll gift it . Don 't be ridiculous ! Seriously , I 've got it spare . You 've got 12 mil spare ? My brother left it me . Own a channel , does he ? No , he ... He died . He ... He died last year , so it got transferred to me . Just over six months ' worth , but I 've kept it . Why don 't you spend it on you , then ? And buy what ? Some new shoes for my doppel to wear ? I don 't know , upgrade your MOS ... Or get a Fat Attack season pass ? Buy one of those wall buddies . The new ones that talk to you after shutting and solve your problems . They guide your dreams , like gurus . It 's amazing , really , what they can do . A mirror plug-in ? That shows me how I look as a werewolf ? What 's the point ? - I know it can be quite funny . - It 's all just stuff . It 's ... It 's stuff , it 's confetti , it 's ... You 've got something real . What better to spend it on ? You heard me singing in a toilet . Is that real ? More than anything that 's happened all year . I can 't take that kind of clockage off someone . It 's 12 mils , no way . Let me do this . I ... I look around here , I just ... I just want something real to happen . Just once . I 'd mess up . You wouldn 't . I don 't care anyway . I 'll go with you . I 'll be able to force you . I 'll force you to go . It 's tomorrow . Come on ! Say yes . I 'll go as far as to say , " OK . " Which proves acceptable . Thank God for that . Walking away now . You loon ! I can live with it ! I 'd love to fucking ruin that and all . What ? 15 ? A flippin ' joke ... 'New from Wraith Babes . 'The hottest girls in the nastiest situations . ' Yeah ! Can 't believe I 'm doing this . I am doing this . I can 't be doing this . Can you trade it back ? The ticket ? Don 't be mad . It 's a lot of pressure to put someone under , you know . Don 't think I 'm not grateful . But it 's , it 's just ... You 're babbling . I 'm babbling . I made you this . You never get to keep them more than a day , but there it is , anyway . It folds flat . So you can keep them in your waistband . Thank you . It 's , you know ... something . Face the screen , please . Is he your Friends And Family allocation ? Hand , please . That 's not permanent , is it ? No . Two months max . Round to the right , and through the scanner . Where do we go now ? You wait here . How long ? So , what do we do ? I don 't know . Hey , hey , hey . Fuck off . Her with the dark hair ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . The pretty one . Yup . OK . Move . They want to preview you . - What ? - Preview . Come on . - He 's with me . - Hand ? Show me your hand . OK . You , too . That 's not fair . She 's new . That 's not fair . I don 't pick the order . I 've waited here all week , and she 's just walked in . Everyone will get seen eventually . I don 't pick the order . But I 'm a good singer . I can sing . I 'm a good singer , I am . - Stand aside . - It 's not fair ! It 's not fair ! - Next lot . - Stand there . Would you like to be as big as Salma one day ? Yeah , I mean ... Could you say that as a self-contained sentence into that screen ? I guess I 'd like to be as big as Salma one day . OK . Proceed to stage area . Are we done ? - Both performing ? - Just her . - Okay ... and what are you ? - Singer . - Compliance ? - No , thanks . A-ha . Yes , thanks ! It 's compulsory for all contestants . More to the point , it 'll stop you puking with nerves . - She 's got to perform . - Well ... Look , just sip it , you 'll be fine . Just a touch of light foam . It 'll pass . Make the most of it . You can 't get this stuff anywhere else . You OK ? Yeah . You OK ? Yeah . Just ... I don 't know . Things are just wider apart . I 'm fine . - Really ? - Yeah , I 'm fine . Right . You 're on . A little closer , please . Little closer . Into the light , love . - And who 're we looking at here ? - Abi Khan . What are you going to do for us today , Abi ? I 'm going to sing . You speak up , love . We don 't bite . I 'm going to sing . Hey , would you mind lifting up your top for me ? Can you take off your top ? I want to check out those titties . Come on . Mucho feranto . No titties ? She says she 's here to sing . I got to see those titties , though . Come on , girl . I mean , damn ! You hot . Please , just sing for us . OK . I 'm going to stop you there . That was ... without a doubt ... probably the best piece of singing we 've had this season . Yes ! Well done ! Fair play . But I have to say ... No . No , no , no . I have to say , actually , I 'm with Rafe on this one . Good though your voice is ... and it is good . It 's not the most magical sound in the world . It 's just ... good . I don 't think anyone 's really hearing it . Certainly not the guys in the audience . These looks you got going on kind of get in the way . Men will want you . Women will hate you . All the time you 're on stage . Couldn 't help picturing you . In an erotic scenario . Getting pretty turned on , if I 'm honest . Right . You 've got this pure beauty What seems to be a knockout figure . And this sort of interesting innocence going on . That 's something I think Rafe 's erotica channels could really play with . Absolutely . That 's what I thought the moment I saw you . The moment . I 'd watch . I don 't know a man here who wouldn 't . To be honest , some of us girls might join you . Get off me ! Don 't ! Abi ! No ! Abi ! Abi ! I don 't think that 's quite ... You will never have to pedal again . Not one minute . We could really work with you . Last year we had singers , singers , singers . So many singers . So , to be a singer you have to be truly exceptional There 's just no slots left for an above average singer . Not for the next few years , at least . Charity ? No . Saturation point , singer-wise . Listen . We said , right from the start . We 'll go with something different this season . That 's why he 's on the panel ! She would be a star on our stream . A star . On his ... You 're furniture , at best . Forget about all the shame , and all that ppht-ppht-tew . We medicate against that . You will have pleasure forever . Realistically , sweetheart , it is that , or the bike . I , I don 't think ... This is starting to annoy me . Who do you think is powering that spotlight ? Millions of people . That 's who . All of them , out there , right now . Putting in an honest day on the bike , while you stand in the light they 're generating and dither . You know what ? They would give anything . Do anything to be where you are now . Am I right ? ! You want to cock a snook at all that , as though it 's nothing . As though they 're nothing . And that makes me sick . But , you know what ? Maybe you do belong on the bike . Because you don 't seem to be very willing to step off it . I do want to . We have a decision ? Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! Do it ! I suppose . Go on ! Well done ! Best thing about my new lifestyle ... I get to meet lots of hot guys . Wraith treats me well . For Christ 's sake ! I pay for this ! I ... pay ... for ... this ! I pump my arse off , and you ... Fuck you ! Yeah , keep waddling , pig tits . Find your horizon and fuck off over it ! 'It 's a dream . 'I get to live ... 'in a ... 'beautiful place . 'And ... 'wear lots of ... 'beautiful things . 'It 's a dream . ' Insufficient funds . 'From Wraith Babes ... ' 'C 'mon , girl ... ' ' .. a Wraith Babes reality special . ' I guess I 'd like to be as big as Thelma one day . 'Millions watched her glide through the Hot Shot curtain of dreams 'to sing her heart out . ' 'What happened next shocked them all . ' We could really work with you . Do we have a decision ? 'Now , watch her stunning erotic debut ... ' No , no , no , no , no ... 'So , who do we have here ? ' I 'm Abby . 'You were at Hot Shot . 'You were real impressive . ' Resume viewing ! - No ! No ! - Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! Resume viewing ! 'Look at you . 'All clean and shiny . ' Portal disabled during commercial . 'You 'll see everything . 'You 'll see it all ! 'Open your mouth . 'Open ... take it in ... 'take it in ... yeah ... No ! No ! No ! No ! 'The hottest girls ... ' Could you stand aside , please ? Come up into the back , in front of me , please . Are you messin ' ? A what-nic one ? An eth-nic one ! On it . We 're going to preview , all right ? Want to follow me in the back ? You 're a prick ! Next , lot . Stand there ! So what are you , a magician ? An entertainer . Could you say that down the screen as a self-contained sentence ? I 'm an entertainer . Before you go on , you need to drink a compliance . They give me one back there . Really ? OK . Well , in that case , you are good to ... go . Who are you ? Bing Madsen . What are you planning to do for us ? What the fuck ? ! 'A sort of performance . ' A sort of performance ? Yes . Man of mystery ! I suppose we 'd better see it . OK . Knob 'ead ! Fucking cock ! Stop or I 'll do it . This is a main artery . Keep walking , you kill me . No-one stops me till I 've said my piece . Then you can do what you like . Man , just fucking kill yourself . Get heavy on me , I swear to God , I kick your ass back to life , just so I could cut your goddamn head off . Go on ! I think we should let him speak . - Speak ! - Speak ! Speak ! Speak ! Speak ! Let 's hear what he has to say . Well ? Come on . Got our attention , as requested . What do you want to say ? Have you prepared a speech , is that it ? Speak ! I haven 't got a speech . I didn 't plan words . I didn 't even try to ... I just knew I had to get here , to stand here , and I wanted you to listen . To really listen , not just pull a face like you 're listening , like you do the rest of the time . A face that you 're feeling instead of processing . You pull a face , and poke it towards the stage , and we lah-di-dah , we sing and dance and tumble around . And all you see up here , it 's not people , you don 't see people up here , it 's all fodder . And the faker the fodder , the more you love it , because fake fodder 's the only thing that works any more . It 's all that we can stomach . Actually , not quite all . Real pain , real viciousness , that , we can take . Yeah , stick a fat man up a pole . We laugh ourselves feral , because we 've earned the right , we 've done cell time and he 's slacking , the scum , so ha-ha-ha at him ! Because we 're so out of our minds with desperation , we don 't know any better . All we know is fake fodder and buying shit . That 's how we speak to each other , how we express ourselves , is buying shit . What , I have a dream ? The peak of our dreams is a new app for our Dopple , it doesn 't exist ! It 's not even there ! We buy shit that 's not even there . Show us something real and free and beautiful . You couldn 't . Yeah ? It 'd break us . We 're too numb for it . I might as well choke . It 's only so much wonder we can bear . When you find any wonder whatsoever , you dole it out in meagre portions . Only then until it 's augmented , packaged , and pumped through 10,000 preassigned filters till it 's nothing more than a meaningless series of lights , while we ride day in day out , going where ? Powering what ? All tiny cells and tiny screens and bigger cells and bigger screens and fuck you ! Fuck you , that 's what it boils down to . Fuck you for sitting there and slowly making things worse . Fuck you and your spotlight and your sanctimonious faces . Fuck you all for thinking the one thing I came close to never meant anything . For oozing around it and crushing it into a bone , into a joke . One more ugly joke in a kingdom of millions . Fuck you for happening . Fuck you for me , for us , for everyone . Fuck you ! That was , without a doubt , the most heartfelt thing I 've seen on this stage since Hotshot began ! Brilliant ! You ... you 're so articulating something we all , and I mean everyone in this hall , something we all agree on . Even though we may not comprehend all of it . I think I 'm right in saying we do feel it . Even me . I know you 've got me down as this creature . You know , hey ... I get where you 're coming from . - I like your stuff . - It 's not stuff . It 's truth . Am I right ? Your truth , admittedly , but truth nonetheless . And you 're right . Authenticity is in woefully short supply . I 'd like to hear you talk again . How so ? The slot on one of my streams where you can talk just like that . I 'd watch it . It was such great passion . He 's a 'right . You 're a little hot there , bud . That throat cutting thing ? Neat gimmick . What do you say ? 30 minutes twice a week ? - Do it , do it , do it ! - Do it , do it , do it ! Do it , do it , do it ! Do it , do it , do it ! Do it , do it , do it ! Do it , do it , do it ! Go on , you bastard . - Do it , do it , do it ! - Do it , do it , do it ! Beats the bike . Certainly does . 'We have with us Oliver . Oliver ate and ate 'till he hit 17 stone and he 's here today to try and beat us 'on Botherguts ! 'Keep going . ' OK , I 'm going to stop you there . That was achingly terrible . You have the magnetism of a towel . I don 't ever want to look at you again . I have to agree . I 'm so sorry , love . You came across as fundamentally unlikeable and really quite worthless . You could fill that pussy with honey and I still wouldn 't fuck it . I 'm a good singer . I can sing , yeah . Cos this is my destiny and I can sing , fu ... ! 'Like that , don 't you , Harry ? 'Say it . 'Yeah . '15,000 new wardrobe options 'launched last week alone .

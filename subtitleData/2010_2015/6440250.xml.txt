 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You were dead for days . GH-325 . Agent Coulson was injected with it and literally minutes later , his wound showed signs of cellular regeneration . I 'd like to turn the machine on again . It induces theta brain wave frequencies to help uncover the secrets buried in the subconscious . Please let me die . When did you start doing this ? First night I saw Garrett 's writings . - What do you think caused it ? - The GH-formula . This is what you 've been doing up here . It 's what I did yesterday . No matter how much I carve , it still means nothing to me . I don 't even have a theory . I do . It 's a map . You 're being transferred . Your brother wants you in his custody . Burning Man . Two years ago , we were stuck in the desert on a glow-in-the-dark bus . Is that it ? What 's Burning Man ? Oh . Are you sure you 're not from Iowa ? Because you just sounded like it . Baltimore . Born and raised . This is gonna drive me nuts . I mean , it 's crazy , right ? We see each other from across the bar , and we just wave at each other like we 're long-lost friends . I know I know you . I just can 't figure out how . - To remembering . - Hmm . - So , you 're an artist ? - Hmm . Yeah , I do some painting and I teach community art classes . Is that how I know you ? Are you an artist ? I do some carving now and then . Well , maybe the reason we think we know each other is because it was our destiny to meet tonight . Look , I haven 't been entirely honest with you . We have met before . And I 've traveled a long way to be with you . Oh , maybe we should just slow this down . No . We share so much . So many memories . So much pain . How do you know about that ? I 'll help you remember . Damn it . How long were you standing there ? Long enough . May gave us specific instructions . You go on a date with the crazy wall , I have to chaperone . I didn 't wanna wake you . Do I look like I 've been sleeping ? What 's keeping you up ? It 's all connected . Everything . Ward has information about my father , who just happens to have the alien buzzkill device , which is somehow connected to the writing , that is related to the GH serum that is in our blood . Like we 're pieces to a puzzle . Except we don 't know what the puzzle is , or how the pieces even fit . It 's a hacker 's worst nightmare . Everlasting Gobstopper of firewalls . It wants us to know . I can feel it . Then " it " should tell us , because I have been trying to match the writing to constellation maps , navigational charts , genome diagrams , and if it 's a map , it 's a map to nowhere . I need you to stick with it . The writing 's coming more and more frequently . It used to be two , three times a month . Then once a week . Now it 's every day , every night . I can 't turn it off . How do you function ? When do you sleep ? That 's why we need answers . And what if we don 't find them ? Anything else ? When does May get back ? Not until we find Ward . This is Morse . I have agents positioned at multiple locations . We have been sitting here for an hour . He has 11 hotboxes within 200 miles of his last known position . Odds are , he 'll show up at one of them . Why isn 't there a nationwide manhunt ? He escaped from federal custody . Senator Ward is covering it up . No one 's looking but us . Welcome to Philadelphia . 30th Street Bus Terminal . This terminal is a non-smoking facility . Smoking is strictly prohibited . Triplett here . I 've got eyes on the prize . I 've got a clear shot and a trigger finger that needs some love . No . Stand by and wait for your orders . Director , say the word and I can end this . The Senator wants him alive . What do you want ? Bring him in . By any means necessary . Copy that . Damn . I don 't know how , but he knows we 're on him . He 's got a dead man switch and enough C-4 to take down the block . Bus 741 to Atlanta , now boarding . He 's on the move . Do not engage . He 's not bluffing . Keep an eye in the sky , May . Have Agents Hunter and Morse in position at the next stop . If we can 't bring him in , at least we can see where he 's going . We found Ward . What ? One of my sources , this guy , Micro , he 's kind of a crime scene junkie . He came across something . The writing , but not exactly how we wanted to see it . When were these taken ? Last night . Whoever did this is still out there . This is the victim ? Janice Robbins . Lives ... Lived in Upstate New York . She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . No , she 's an art teacher from Iowa . I have her full bio . I 'm not wrong . I 've seen her . We should check it out . You know , we 're breaking about 14 laws right now . One of the perks of being outlaws . This had to happen on my shift ? You couldn 't wait till May got back ? May 's got her hands full with Ward . And we 're the only ones who know what we 're looking for . What are we looking for ? Answers . You 're right . This place just screams S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . You two don 't have a single thing in common unless you have some Enya albums you 've been hiding . No . Nothing in common at all . I take that back . There 's a lot of overlap . We were definitely working on the same design , but she has some pieces I was missing . How does the carving we found in Miami fit into this ? Whoever did it was on our wavelength . There 's just a few pieces missing . It 's almost there . You were right . She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . Agent Rebecca Stevens , Level 6 . Stationed at the Triskelion . That 's probably where I saw her . Not recently , you didn 't . According to this , she died five years ago from cancer . How is that possible ? We won 't know until we perform an autopsy . Don 't you need a body for that ? How 'd you two manage to acquire a body ? Corpsey diem . " Seize the dead . " Look , like I told my man here , you want something in life , you gotta grab it and walk out like you own it . Is that all it takes ? Really ? Because I always thought if you wanted something in life , you had to work hard and earn it . Give me some room , please . Does she have any family ? Mmm-mmm . No one . No relatives , no kids . She didn 't deserve this . Is anything coming back to you ? She was Level 6 . It should all be in my head , but it 's not . We 're going to need blood and tissue samples . Full CBC and multi-element analysis . Would anyone like to leave before we get started ? We 'll stay out of your way . I 'll let you know when I finish . Bus 16 , limited service to Montgomery , is now boarding . All passengers for Montgomery are welcome to board at this time . Bus 417 , Dallas-Fort Worth , is now boarding lane five . Passengers for Dallas can board in lane five . - Need some help with those ? - I 'm okay . It 's no problem , really . I promise I don 't bite . I 'm Zack . Eliza . This is Graham . Hey , Graham . So , you wanna give me a hand with this ? - Sure . - All right . Oh . Looks like you don 't need my help after all . Graham here is doing all the heavy lifting . You mind if I tag along with you anyway ? Where you heading ? Dallas . Must be fate . There you go , sweetie . Thank you . You 're a real savior . Join us for the ride ? I prefer the back . Excuse me ? Is that seat taken ? All yours . Thanks . Don 't like to fly , huh ? Excuse me ? I never understood why people would take the bus when they can fly . Says the man on the bus . Ah , last-minute trip . Didn 't have a choice . You here by choice ? Yeah , I like the scenery . Can 't see the world with your head in the clouds . Can 't see it with your face in a book , either . It 's a long trip . There 's plenty of time for everything . Well , you could just skip to the end . And miss all the good parts in between ? It can 't be that interesting . Why do you say that ? Because you were on page 117 when you were waiting outside , and you 're still on page 117 . So , either you 're a really slow reader , or you 're working for Coulson . Who ? I am impressed . You tell him I said that . I almost missed you . What are you talking about ? I 'm sure they told you about this . If you try or say anything , everyone in this bus will be flying . So , just keep reading your book , and hope for a happy ending . Driver ? Yes , sir . I 'm on the wrong bus . Guess I , uh , need to pay closer attention to things . Last call forbus 4168 to Boston . All passengers ... Sorry . Had to get rid of some excess baggage . You were right , May . He 's good . Very good . Hunter , if you 're in position , he 's all yours . Copy that , darling . Happy to oblige . The cuts were all quite deep , but the cause of death was cardiac arrest . She died from shock due to the pain , not from the wounds . Very common in this type of ritualistic murder . " Ritualistic " ? It has all the characteristics . The cuts are very precise , and the killer continued to carve on her long after she died , as if there was some need to complete the work . My hunch is that it wasn 't the first time either . It 's also not the first time we 've seen these carvings . They 're the same ones Garrett was making , correct ? Dr. Simmons , here are the reports you requested . Thank you . It 's the analysis from the subjects . Subjects ? Plural ? We found blood and tissue samples from a secondary source under her nails . She put up a fight . Oh , no . Just as I suspected . She had GH-325 in her blood . A T.A.H.I.T.I. patient . Whoever killed her also had GH-325 in their blood . Don 't look at me . I didn 't do it . No , of course , but you both had GH-325 injections . Hypergraphia was one of the side effects they tried to treat with memory replacement . Garrett suffered from it . Apparently , so does our killer . And they both turned into dangerous psychopaths . Have either of you been experiencing a compulsion to write , or carve ? We 're fine . But somewhere out there is a T.A.H.I.T.I. patient who may be targeting all the others . We need to find him . The patient files were all destroyed . How would anyone be able to locate them ? I don 't know . How many T.A.H.I.T.I. patients were there ? I don 't know . Do you think the killer will come after the two of you ? I don 't know . If you don 't know anything , then how are we gonna find them ? You 're gonna have to torture it out of me . Is all this really necessary ? If you 're going to insist on doing this , I 'm going to be monitoring you very closely . It took me and Fitz six weeks to figure out how to operate this . And quite honestly , I never thought we 'd have to use it . We should 've destroyed it . In the history of bad ideas , this is light-years ahead of everything . No , trying to bring dead agents back to life using alien blood blows everything else away . They buried those memories for a reason , Coulson , they were driving people insane . And now you wanna uncover it when you 've been getting worse ? May would never ... May 's not the Director . This is my call . I was put in charge of the T.A.H.I.T.I. Project , so those people are my responsibility . If going back in this machine saves even one life , then it 's worth the risk . Stealing bodies , talking about aliens and bringing the dead back to life ? What kind of Creature Feature did I sign up for ? Coulson lost his ... Marbles ? Mind ? No , memories . The machine helps him find them . Mack , I need you close , just in case . In case ? In case he starts screaming and you need to hold him down . Okay , try to stay relaxed , listen to my voice . I 'll guide you through , but at the first sign of any duress , I 'm pulling you out . No . Not until we have everything we need to find this guy . All systems are go . Concentrate on Agent Stevens . She 's your access point , focus on her . All right . Take him back . What do you see ? Where are you ? The Guest House . In the interview room . Do you recognize anyone ? I 'm alone . Concentrate on Agent Stevens . How do you feel today ? Terrific . I 've never felt better . Do you remember how you got here ? I volunteered . I was dying , and when I woke up , everything was okay . She 's here . She 's doing well . And the others ? How many are there ? Thank you , Agent Coulson , for all your help . I 'm ready to get back in the field . I can 't believe this actually worked . I feel great . It 's a new day . How long are you keeping me here ? Six patients , well-adjusted . I 'm recommending immediate release . No ! - His heart rate is spiking . - What 's happening , Coulson ? I see the writing . For the first time . Something 's happening to them . Oh , my God ! I wanna get out of here ! Oh , my God ! I wanna get out of here ! I wanna get out of here ! I wanna get out of here ! No ! How long are you gonna keep me here with these lunatics , Coulson ? Vital signs elevating . Tell me what 's going on , Coulson . Degenerative effects . They 're unstable . They 're getting worse every day . They 're getting worse every day . We 're losing them . We need to shut down the program . This isn 't a failure , Agent Coulson , it 's a first step . We rejuvenated life . This isn 't life . We need to shut it down and destroy the host . You can 't do that ! It 's thousands of years old , predating the pyramids . We haven 't even scratched the surface of the benefits . These are human beings , not lab rats . I 'm contacting Fury . There 's still hope for them . The host 's genetic material may be implanting its own genetic memories onto theirs , creating the psychic schism . If we were to completely wipe away all their memories ... Erase their minds ? That 's hope ? We can give them new memories , new identities . They 'll never be agents again , but they 'll be able to lead normal , healthy lives . Let me die ! No , stop ! Please , no ! Please , will you make it stop ? Please , make it stop ! Please , somebody ! Somebody stop it ! Damn it , stop doing this , please ! Please , stop ! What have we done ? What have we done ? What have we done ? What did you do ? Tell me . We erased them . All of them . New names , new memories . It was the only way . You did the right thing . Can you find their new names ? - How much more can he take ? - I don 't know . Whatever you 're doing to him , you need to stop . Coulson , we need their names . Find their names so we can pull you out ! Lewis Seaver . That 's one . Keep them coming ! Keep them coming ! Looks like the Big Bad Wolf is stopping for a pint . I 'll give you a choice . Columbian Necktie , or Bullet in the Head ? Bullet in the Head . On the rocks . On the house . Welcome back . Hello . May , we have a problem . Grant Ward . In from the cold at last . Mr. Garrett spoke quite highly of you . Imagine my surprise when I received your call . I wasn 't even aware that phone was active . Or you , for that matter . We thought you were dead . Not dead . Waiting . I was locked in a cage . Before that , I was trapped behind a S.H.I.E.L.D. badge . Now , I 'm finally free . How can we help you ? Since Strucker is overseas , I assume you report to someone else . - That 's correct . - I want a meeting . Though we do appreciate your talents and your loyalty , Mr. Whitehall is a very busy man . Will his schedule open up if I can get you face-to-face with Coulson ? Close enough to put a bullet in his head ? Skye ? Coulson ? Anyone ? When the cat 's away ... Keep trying to reach them . I 'm taking us down . " The body of Lewis Seaver was found " in the remains of the Santa Maria church fire in Miami . " The fire was this guy , too . Three of the others died of unnatural causes in the last six weeks . This guy is definitely targeting T.A.H.I.T.I. patients . Is there still a chance ? Two of them are alive . We need to find out which one is the killer . Do you remember anything ? Any clues ? Stay out of my head , Coulson . There 's nothing wrong with me . Roll up your sleeves . You don 't need to erase me . There 's nothing wrong with me ! You 're not okay , and it 's only gonna get worse . But I can help you . No ! It 's the only way to know ! You can 't erase me , Coulson ! Don 't do this to me , Coulson ! I need to know ! No ! You can 't erase me ! I need to know what it means ! It wants me to know ! I need to know ! It wants me to know ! I need to know ! I need to know ! I need to know ! No ! No ! I need to know ! Get him the hell out of there ! - Shut it down ! Shut it down ! - I need to know ! Sedate him ! I 'm calling May ! I 've got Skye . Skye ? We have a Ward situation that 's about to get really bad for all of us . Coulson went into the memory machine . What ? And you let him ? It wasn 't my call ! Lock him up and keep him under observation until I get back . What the hell is going on ? Let 's just stay focused . I need to know ! I need to know ! - What did you do to him ? - Just hold him down ! Coulson ! Don 't make me use this . I 'm sorry . I spoke to May . She wants us to lock you up until she gets back . I think that 's a good idea . His name was Sebastian Derik . He was an assassin from the dark side of S.H.I.E.L.D. How many others did you say are still alive ? Just one . Hank Thompson . He only lives a few hours away from here , so I 'll send some agents to protect him . That won 't be necessary . Coulson ? Sorry . I need to take care of him personally . Coulson , what are you ... Hey , you wanna slow down that train , buddy ? You wanna see him crash , don 't you ? I fear for the world the day you get your driver 's license . Hank ! There 's someone up at the house that wants to see you . Is it a customer ? Says he 's an old friend . Okay , I 'll be right there . I 've seen some messed up stuff in my day , Turbo , but nothing quite like that . Holding down the Director like he 's possessed . Yeah , well . What happened , that 's not ... Wasn 't his fault . Oh , I know . Someone jumbled his memories . No , his memories weren 't jumbled . They were replaced . Just some of them . - You 're up . - No , I 'm okay . No , come on . It 's good for you . Helps your brain and hands learn to get their act together . Replaced memories , jumbled memories . How the hell is he supposed to keep everything together ? What if he forgets what team he 's on ? You know , I like my bosses un-jumbled at all times . Yeah , he is . Or he will be . He 'll recover . He did before . Besides , brains never delete files , they just lose connections . But there 's always a back-up . Just a matter of digging and finding them . So you 've got back-up files , too ? Has anyone seen Skye ? Oh , no . Guys , quick . It 's about time ! - Coulson did this to you ? - You think ? Is he going after the killer ? Not the killer . Can I help you ? My name is Phil Coulson . You don 't remember me , but we 've met . It 's very important that we talk . This isn 't a good time . You need to listen to me . Look , I have no idea who you are or what you want , but you need to leave . Mr. Thompson , please . Look , if you have something to say , you can say it out here . I have every reason to believe that your life is in danger . Is your family home ? No . That 's good , because I need to pick your brain . No one 's been in or out since the party started . You 're sure no one saw you ? I didn 't blow my cover . You suggesting I did ? It 's okay , it happens . What did you do ? Come on too strong ? Subtlety is key . - You were dressed like a cowboy . - I ... Enough ! There 's a good chance Ward 's wearing his Ka-Boom Box . If we can 't get a fast , clean shot , he could take the whole building down with us inside . We don 't have the resources for this . We should call in outside reinforcements . No . If Ward saw them coming , he 'd take them all down with him . So , what 's the plan ? Get a fast , clean shot . I don 't wanna hurt you , but you need to listen to me . You were an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Please . Just go . Do you recognize these symbols ? No , no , I don 't ! Look , is that all you need ? Think . Have you been drawing , carving , painting ? Anything that reminds you of these ? I 've never seen them in my life . Look at them ! Try to remember ! I need to know what this means ! You have pieces that I need ! I don 't know what you 're talking about and I don 't care ! Look , I 've told you both . You 've got the wrong guy ! Both ? Someone got here before me ? Is he dead ? I 'd be very quiet if I were you . Agent Coulson , I 've got bad news . The lunatics are running the asylum . Do you remember me , Coulson ? Do you remember what you did to me ? I tried to help you . What ? By erasing my memories ? Trying to change who I was ? It was the only way to save you . It didn 't work . You wanna know why ? 'Cause I discovered a little secret . Pain made me remember . I found out after I started cutting myself . The more pain , the more I remembered . That 's how I found the others you erased . I remembered who they were and who they became . I came for you first , Coulson . But you were already dead . Yet , here you are . Why is that ? Are you one of us now ? Why ? Why would you do that , when you know what it does ? I didn 't . I think it 's because you wanted to know the answer to this . Look , I tried to help the others remember . I cut , and I cut , but no one had the answer . I need to know , Coulson . What does it mean ? I don 't know . I 'm trying to find out , just like you . Do they drive you crazy ? Yes . I started carving on walls . Is that how you started ? Yes . It 's not deep enough . You can 't just scratch the surface , Coulson . We have to dig deep . That 's why I started carving bodies . It has to be deep . It 's not two-dimensional . No , the answer isn 't on the surface . It 's what lies beneath . We can find it . Together . That 's the idea . No , no . But what does it mean , Coulson ? I don 't know . Take your family ! Go ! Go , go ! What the hell is T.A.H.I.T.I. ? T.A.H.I.T.I. was designed to revive a fallen Avenger . That 's how it got started . Captain America , Iron Man ? Those Avengers ? Those are the ones . How the hell could Coulson forget that ? What , does he have alien blood , too ? Can you imagine that ? S.H.I.E.L.D. being run by a man that 's part alien ? Yeah , imagine that . - Hey ! - What the ... Call the police ! There 's two guys trying to kill each other . They 're out in my place , Thompson Welding . It 's right down the road . All right , stay here . We 'll handle this . Okay . You want pain ? Come and get some . You can 't hide , Coulson . We 're connected by the blood . The answer 's right here , Derik ! All you have to do is look ! Let him go , Coulson ! It 's okay . I 'm okay now . That 's what you said before you threw me in a cell . Fair enough . But I 'm not trying to kill him , I 'm trying to save him . I 'm giving you to the count of three . And my gun 's real . It 's here , Skye . Everything we 've been looking for . - One ... - He 's not kidding ! Let him go ! - Open your eyes , Derik . - Two ! It 's just below the surface , like you said . All you have to do is look . Three ! You can put the guns away . He won 't hurt anyone now . How do you know that ? He found what he 's been looking for . What we 've all been looking for . The final piece . I don 't believe it . It 's not so much a map as a blueprint . It 's a city . So , I was some kind of super spy ? One of the best . We could use you . The whole story 's right here . What you were , who you were . I know who I am . I 'm Hank Thompson . Got a wife I love , a kid I adore , and every day I wake up happy . Can 't imagine I was happy being a spy . Uh , no offense . None taken . Thank you , Mr. Coulson . Thank you for giving me a second chance . For making me who I am . You 're a good man , Mr. Thompson . You always were . These agents will take you home now . Sorry about the blindfold . I understand . Spy stuff . Oh , if you , uh , ever need any welding , you know where to find me . Thanks . Sebastian Derik has been turned over to the authorities . He had sins to atone for long before T.A.H.I.T.I. ever happened . But at least he found his peace . And you ? The compulsion 's gone . How can you be sure ? I can feel it . Whatever 's in our blood , it was driving us . To go to that city , like homing pigeons . Only , we couldn 't figure out what home was , so it was just driving us mad . Once I had all the pieces ... Now we just need to figure out why this alien was so hell-bent on getting there . Any news on Ward ? We 'll find him . In the meantime , we 'll take advantage of his gift , Mr. Bakshi . Here 's his cell phone . See what you can find inside . All right , let 's get this over with . To answer the question on everyone 's mind . No , I 'm not crazy . I know in the past few months it may have seemed like I was leading you on some fool 's errand , chasing after strange carvings and artifacts . At times , I questioned it myself , wondering if I was chasing windmills , trying to solve some unsolvable puzzle . But the pieces are coming together . The puzzle 's taking shape . The bad news . HYDRA 's trying to solve the same puzzle and they have more resources . The good news . We now have a piece they don 't have . Everything we 've been doing , it all leads here . Ourjob , find it before anyone else . All right , Mr. Bakshi , I hope you weren 't into selfies , or this could be embarrassing for both of us . Hail HYDRA . Hey , Skye . Where are you ? Just wanted to make sure you got my present . I promised him a face-to-face with Coulson . Probably not exactly what he had in mind . I 'll be sending a few other gifts your way , now and then . Like a cat bringing in dead birds ? No thanks . Just trying to be helpful . Oh , met the new recruits . I don 't think they need to hang around much longer . Is that a threat ? Just a suggestion . Coulson could do better . Then again , I am hard to replace . How about you tell me where you are , and we can talk about it ? I have to go now , Skye . I have a few personal matters to attend to . But I 'll be seeing you soon . I promise .

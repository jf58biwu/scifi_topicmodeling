 I feel like the play is saving my life right now . Everybody , this is Felix , my acting coach . Hello ! - I killed Aynsley ! - No ! We just need to prove that Donnie 's really your monitor . My old network . - Mummy ! - Project LEDA ? I swear to you , I don 't know who they are . You sold us to the Proletheans . Are you excited for our big adventure , monkey ? You did well to save her , Mark . She 's a mirror . See ? Her internal organs are reversed . It 's a brand-new day . Hey . All right , Fe ? Oh , yeah . I adore camping . It 's not really camping , is it ? More like sleeping in a truck . I slept in the bed of a flatdeck . In my world , that 's considered camping . Otherwise known as homeless in the country . Eh , how much did Kira see of Barry birdwatcher 's , you know , " pfff ! " ? - Demise ? - Yeah . She didn 't see Siobhan take the shot , thank God . Jesus Christ . Our dear old mum 's a dead eye with a rifle . It just makes me queasy . Yeah , she was cold , Fe . Like she 'd done it before . This is insane . It 's S , you know ? She makes tea and ... And she taught me piano . Oh ! Bloody hell ! Come on ! Ah ha ha ! That 's ... Don 't laugh . Oh , is it bad ? Disgusting ! No ! God ! What 's so funny ? Uncle Felix , camping , is funny . No , I 'm not . God , I 'm going to have to wash my whole foot ! Okay , look , we need to get to civilization . Sorry , Hank . Shouldn 't have put my faith in them . Nah , nobody said it was going to be easy , Mark . Just going to have to work with what we 've been given . Helena . Mm-hmm . Light ' em up . When are we going to get breakfast ? We 'll get you something now , yeah ? Well , I 'd have happily taken us to that last Greasy Spoon , but mummy threw my visa card out the window . Because they might track us . Hey , kiddo . Whoa , whoa whoa ! Hey , hey , little missy . Did you , uh , did you forget something ? 'Cause you kind of got to pay for it , first . I don 't have any money . Hey . There you are . Yeah , um , look , somebody forgot to pay for something , so . Ohh ! Kira , I told you to wait ' til I gave you money . Didn 't I ? Sorry about that . I think that should ... Oh , shit ! Whoa , whoa ! I got it . I got it . - Sorry . You got it ? Okay , thanks . - No problem . - Is that good ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? Okay . Sorry . - Yeah . Bye . No , yeah . Uh ... What are you doing here , Angie ? Got something that might tempt you out of obscurity . Let me guess ... You went to the hospital , after I told you not to . Eh ! Still got it , Art . And guess what . That Shakira-haired lookalike ? Gone . Poof . Surveillance shows some guy wheeling her out . Who ? No ID on either one of them . Yet . Sit your ass down , Angie . No , I think I 'll stand , Art . I told you ... Let it go . If you don 't , I will go to hardcastle myself and tell him you 're still after it . You know you 're letting down two partners now , right ? Me and Beth . Well , I mean , it was just a complete disaster , you know , it was like my worst nightmare , not having done my hair for picture day . Hey , baby , that thing we did at the store ? We don 't do that , unless we have to , yeah ? I know , mum . Just , uh , go get your stuff from the truck , yeah ? Careful . You know , I 've been in this area before . When ? There 's loads of cabins and summer houses . We 'll just find an empty one and we 'll hole up for a bit . She needs a proper bed , Fe . Okay . Alison . Hey , stop ! Alison , come on . Oh . What are you doing here ? Why aren 't you at work ? I told you ... Susan Teller 's in Austin this week . So your boss is away . That 's why you 're playing hooky ? Uh , yeah . Hmm . Hey , honey , the other day , with Sarah Stubbs , you know , in the cemetery ? I 'm worried , is all . You 've been so wound up . And I know , well , you got that big dress rehearsal tomorrow , right ? - Ahem . - Who 's my little star ? That is not helping . Well , don 't you sit down right here and let me relax you ? You know , morning 's my best time . I just showered . This is nice , eh ? Doesn 't look like anybody 's around . Looks well-appointed . Okay , let 's have a look . Hmm . I dunno . Bachelor , maybe ? A photographer . Mmm ! Dr. Cormier , look at you , waltzing into Leekie 's office whenever you wanna . Well , only when he 's away . But he 's away a lot and I like it in here . We should mess with his like little bio-energy hobby farm . I 'm going to put like an electric eel in one of these tubes . He 'll be like " Great Scott , I 've created life itself . " Cosima . What ? Come here . What ? I just found out . I think you have a right to see this . All right . I just want to show you . Oh , whoa . Who is that ? Hi . I 'm Jennifer Fitzsimmons . I 'm a teacher and swim coach at Sheldon High . So they asked me to keep this video journal because they found polyps on my lungs . I was having trouble breathing and went in for tests and ... Yeah , unidentified polyps . Jennifer was the first to show symptoms , 6 months before Katja Obinger . We have hours of these tapes . She all right ? She died . 3 days ago . I 'm sleeping here tonight . Oh ! Me , too ! Uncle Felix already called it . No ! He didn 't . When are we going to see Mrs. S again ? I don 't know . I was wondering the same . She protected us , though . Didn 't she , even though she was lying ? I hope , but I 'll protect you now . I know I wasn 't always around , but I 'm here now . Nothing bad is going to happen to you . Except for that . Except for that . And this . Don 't . No ! 305 . Yeah , just out by county line , here . Probably abandoned . Plates have been removed . I got a vin number , though . You ready ? All right , India Foxtrot Alpha Nine Charlie ... Look at her , Gracie . Men schemed for years to build her , but only God could make her fertile . You think far too highly of her . Grace . Is your name ? Yes . Why am I here ? Father says he wants you to join our family . I 've already got a family . You 're barely even human . I have a twin sestra . And a plemyannica , a niece . Where is Tomas ? Gone . My dad said back to Europe , in the dark ages . Good riddance . Hey , Sarah , wake up . Someone 's here . They 're coming . Look , we 've got to go , now ! Oh , God . Run ! Felix . Hey ! Shit ! Hey ! Whoa ! Look ... Cal ! Cal ! Cal ! Sarah ? You know him ? ! What the hell are you doing in my house ? ! W ... We were in a bind . We broke in . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . A bind ? Oh , no . You got so much nerve . Last time I saw you , you took 10 grand and my car . You brought us to the house of one of your marks ? ! Felix ... Are you insane ? - Hey , hey , Felix . Relax , relax . - " One of your marks " . Felix . Foster brother and an avowed pacifist . Sure . No offense , but get out . I don 't want to know you . Cal , please . Get out ! Cal , please ! Mummy . What 's going on ? Shit . Oh , baby , come here . You okay ? Did you get scared ? I 'm sorry . It 's just Cal . He 's an old friend . Yeah . Well , actually , I 'm not . You okay ? Are you my dad ? Blow me down . Is this a scam ? Right . You , with the cute little girl and she goes " Are you my daddy ? " And I get fleeced again ? It 's not a scam , Cal . I was here with you for a month . Timing 's right . She 's yours . You 're killing me . Look , I didn 't come here for a father figure for my kid . No ? I just needed a place to sleep . That 's it . Well , what kind of shit are you into now ? We 're going to leave . We 're going to get our stuff . We 're going to go . - Great . Walk away . - Yeah . Yeah . That 's your specialty , isn 't it ? Hold on ! Hold ... I 'm not going to kick this little girl out on the street . You can spend another night , if it helps you out , all right ? Thank you . Just don 't steal anything . Okay , okay . Okay , okay , that 's great . That 's great . That 's great . Alison . Hmm . Let 's save that beautiful instrument for the audience , okay ? Guys , let 's just do the dialogue . Okay ? Dialogue only . Holy f-fishsticks . Sorry . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to startle you . I 'm locked out of my car . My phone 's inside . Think I could borrow yours to call my husband ? Oh , yeah . Been there . You 're a lifesaver . Ooh , I love your kicks . Do you live nearby ? Uh , yeah . Black Oak Drive . Oh . Hilldale Crescent . I 'm Angie . Alison . Hey . Hey , Laura . It 's me . Is he in ? Did you say Hillsdale Drive ? Yeah . Oh . I 've never seen you before . We just moved in . Hey , hon , it 's me . Brain cramp over at the Community Centre . I locked myself out of the car . Can you bring me the spare key ? You 're the best . Half an hour . Hey , can I buy you a cup of coffee as a thank you ? No . I have to pick up my kids . Okay . No worries . Maybe some other time . I know I should 've told you , but , um , I wanted you all to myself . But you always left . You know I never had a real mum and dad , yeah ? Yeah . When I was your age , it made me very angry . And I was so confused and I don 't want that for you . I guess I brought you here because there 's two parts of you , yeah ? One of them is me and one is your dad . Do you get that ? Do you like Cal ? Yeah . A long time ago , I liked him very much . I like his beard . Make yourself at home . Sorry . I 'm not snooping . Just wondering . Uh-huh . Listen , I am intimately acquainted with my sister 's bullshit . My concern is for Kira . Whatever you 're angling for , man , just ask . Good . Okay . Who are you ? Sarah must 've come back here for a reason , so what is this ? What , exactly , do you do ? It 's what I did . Pollinators . Sorry ? Minidrone pollinators , for areas where bee populations have crashed . I designed the microoptics , but my partners forced me out and sold the technology to the military . And , now , they kill people from bases in Virginia with it . But I don 't . Moralist with money . Perfect mark . For child support ? She already robbed me once . The bad news is the cough is getting worse . But the amazing news is Dr. Aldous Leekie of the DYAD Institute says he can help , so they 're going to fly me out for treatment . Thanks to this amazing guy ... Come . This is Greg , my amazing boyfriend . Oh , my God . New semester starts today . Hallie sent me a picture of the new class . They look like a good group . - That 's enough . - Mr. Lomero sent me a card . You 've seen all of it . There . That 's her monitor , right ? Yeah . Sometimes I forget that you 're mine . That 's good . He kept her completely in the dark . She had this total fake hope . It 's not fake , not for any of us . The fact that she was naive did not compromise her treatment . You know , we are telling you everything now , but if you can 't handle it ... I can handle it . Don 't be a bitch . That 's what I thought . Better get ready . Dr. Leekie couldn 't even help me . He lied . How am I doing ? I 'm going to die here . You brought us here on purpose . You wanted Kira to meet her father . I didn 't even know he 'd be here , Fe . Bollocks ! That is bollocks , Sarah , and you know it . For 8 years ... 8 years ... You pretended you didn 't know who he was ? You let me narrow it down to Ziggy the drummer or that guy that you met in Orange County , at that bar ? You knew the whole time . Look , after yesterday , stealing to feed Kira , we were in the area . I just ... God ! I knew it was time to ... You are a bloody wrecking ball . You are an exploding cigar . Do you know that ? Look , just let me patch things up with Cal . He 's a good guy , Fe . - I bet he is . - He is . Resourceful . Big farm biceps . Yeah , he 's completely disconnected from all the shit we 're dealing with . I think Kira deserves something ... Something nourishing , for once , even just for a few days . Yeah . No , you 're right . She just met her father . You can 't yank her away . But uncle Felix isn 't going to be babysitting while you negotiate custody . Come on , Fe . No . I 've got other drama in my life , Sarah . Alison 's musical opens tomorrow . She needs me . There 's no place for me here . Nothing more to say . Except goodbye to Kira . You ready ? Hey , I take it you did a rotation in pathology , Dr. Cormier . I did . Then ... A ... Are you okay ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm fine . Okay . Are you fine to help me with this ? - Because I ... - Yeah yeah yeah yeah , I 'm fine . So , as you can see , the intestine has been tied off , so I 'm going to cut it free . So what are those sores , um , on her lips ? Oh , look , from the cyclophosphamide treatment . The same reason she lost her hair . So , um , it 's not Wegener 's granulomatosis or Churg-Strauss Syndrome . It 's got to be autoimmune , right ? Yes , but unclassified . And immunosuppressives had limited effect . But look , on the uterine wall . The growths , they 're more pronounced , more mature . Right . So this could mean that they have originated in the uterus and spread from there . That could be the cause of her infertility . Possibly . No , now 's not a good time . Sorry , it 's my mom . Sorry , I 'm kind of in the middle of it . Red alert , Cosima . I 've just been approached by another monitor , which means they know I know about Donnie , which means you definitely can 't trust Delphine . That 's complicated . Complicated ? My play opens tomorrow . Your play . Don 't belittle me , Cosima . Felix is gone . Sarah 's gone . You and I are the only ones who can hold down the fort now . Look , I 'm having enough trouble holding down my own fort today . Sorry to bother you with the very crucial information that I 'm being double monitored . I 'm sorry , okay ? Just go through the motions with Donnie , okay ? Uh , uh ... Break a leg , or whatever . I 'll call you tomorrow , okay ? Unless Delphine blackbags you into the back of an SUV and then puts you in a rabbit cage somewhere . Then , I 'll never speak to you again . Hey , you . Hey . Hatha yoga today . It 's mostly an older crowd , but at least I don 't get hipster dudes staring at my ass , right ? So you must be in that play that starts today . Look , I know what you 're doing , Angie ... If that 's even your real name ... So you can just go back to your bosses and tell them it didn 't work . Okay , wait . Wait ! You 're right . Okay . I 'm a police officer . Yeah , like Beth . So why don 't you tell me about that , huh ? How about Sarah Manning ? Look , I can help you . But you got to tell me what you know . You stay away from me . Hey . She 's out like a light . She wanted me to say goodnight . You know , back then , when you left , it took me a long time to admit to myself that I 'd been played . Yeah , well , what you don 't know is that I already had all your bank codes and passwords . I was going to take you for everything you had , - selling your company . - Why didn 't you ? You just made it ... Hard . I 'm not that person anymore , Cal , but , I 'm still just as much trouble . Get down . What ? Hide . Local cop . - Shit ! - You want to say hi ? Eh , Tom ! Great to see you , man . Cal . How 's that spey rod working out ? Oh , I don 't know how you cast that thing . 16 feet long . I spend half the day tangled in the bushes . You know you 're supposed to use it on the water , right ? Right . So what 's going on ? Oh , a bunch of nothing , probably . Some shoplifters hit up the store . A mom with a little girl - and another guy . - Yeah ? And I found a stolen truck just down the way . May be connected . Not sure . Huh . Well , it 's been all quiet here , since I got back last night . Yeah , well ... You know I 've never asked any questions about why you moved here . Or about that little weed patch you got out back . Come on , man . Look , all I 'm saying is I 'd like to think you can trust me , by now . Tom , if I thought there was anything you should know , I 'd tell you . Good enough . 'Night . See you later . I shouldn 't have put you in that position . Oh , come on , it 's all right . He 's a friend . No . He 's not going to say anything . He 's gone . No no no . We 're gone , too , man . Now ? Yeah . Kira 's sleeping . Yeah , well , she 's used to it . Come on , come on , just hold on . Where are you going to go ? Just ... I don 't know , somewhere . Tell me what 's going on here . - It 's not your problem . - You 're safe here . I can 't trust that , Cal . Trust me . Can 't you stop running for a minute ? ♪ I 'll remember the days Okay , troupe . Troupe , let 's gather . Kelsey , everyone . Alison . Alison . Sorry . Let 's gather . Everyone , join hands , please . Okay , today 's performance is dedicated to our dearly departed Aynsley . Aynsley , we know you 're with us and we are going to do you proud . For Aynsley . For Aynsley ! Oh , Sheila , why didn 't you just tell me the truth ? You would 've turned me in . You ... You never ... " You would never !

Honey , are you okay ? Ali ? Oh , my God . Don 't just stand there . Go get some help ! You don 't want to confuse Kira , huh ? Good intuition . Guess that 's where she gets it . Coffee ? Yeah . Name 's Peter White . I 'm a detective from Gresham . Looking for a little girl in a custody case . With a dark-haired woman in her 20s , British accent . They stole a truck that was up here . Yeah , yeah . They were here yesterday . They distracted me while some new-waver stole a bunch of food . New-waver , huh ? Sounds like ' em . Any idea where they might be headed ? I hear you 're not happy with our plans for Helena . She doesn 't belong here . No-o-o , you 're scared . I understand that , but what do we say about fear ? Doubt 's first cousin , am I right ? You have doubts , Gracie ? No . C 'mere . Close your eyes . What do you hear ? The wind . Mm-hmm . The men , working . Him . You hear him , don 't you ? Yes . Yeah . Gracie , you 're my firstborn , but Helena does have a soul , she does have a purpose , and she is going to be a part of our family now . That 's what tomorrow 's all about . I 'm guessing you 're the detective been asking questions in town . Yeah . Sorry I didn 't pop by to say hello , but time is of the essence . Hmm . Any help you could provide would be much appreciated . Well , if the folks you 're looking for were still around , they 'd be in custody . Guess I 'll be on my way , then . Probably best . Last card . Uh-oh . I win ! Aw , no ! You 're a shark ! She beat you . Can I go feed the chickens again , Cal ? Sure . Go for it . Those are going to be some fat chickens . You going to tell me what 's going on ? No , I 'm not going to put that shit on you . Mummy ! Uh-oh . What does that mean ? Mummy ! Mummy ! Shit . Kira ! She 's fine ! Just get in the car and she 'll stay that way . Don 't ... Don 't hurt her ! You ... Get back in the house , Cal . He 's got nothing to do with this . Yeah ? He does now . No ! Kira ! Kira , run !

Miracle on top of miracle . Although we are small in rank , we have broken away from the old world because we know what they do not ... Man 's work is God 's work , as long as you do it in God 's name . Helena , was created by man , not in his name , but God shone his light down upon her . Shh-shh-shh . Shh-shh-shh ! You are hereby bound together before God . Lord , we are asking you , as simply as we can ... Reclaim Helena from eternal damnation . Bless us with your bounty . We are your instruments in the war for creation . Amen . Amen . Where 'd you get this ? I 'm not telling you shit . Yeah , I have Sarah , but not the girl . Look , don 't worry . I know who she 's with . We have another problem , here ... She has a photo , project Lida , ' 77 . We 'll be back in 8 hours . Look , Kira 's got nothing to do with this . She 's your daughter . You touch her , and I will bury you . Just drive . I demand to speak to Dr. Leekie , right this second ! You 're trespassing , Detective Bell . Dad , it 's awake . She 's part of the family , now , Gracie . Henrik ! Does that mean that Mrs. S knew the whole time ? What else is she not bloody telling us ? 20 years ago , you brought an orphan to my door . She 's the key to all of this .

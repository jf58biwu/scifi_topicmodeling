This marked the first time the Sidonian military took the offensive . as they succeeded in destroying a Garde-formed Gauna . The remaining Gauna 490 counterattacked and the squad tactically retreated to regroup . But Gauna 490 appeared to have gone invisible and fled . and are examining new tactics to engage the Garde-formed Gauna . Sidonian troops repel Gauna . I 'd say that 's putting things pretty broadly . Will there be an announcement regarding the Ena specimen Tanikaze recovered ? What are they talking about ? The one the Gauna 's Ena mimicked . It was Hoshijiro . I know that one of the three is alive . Why is Nagate getting sent out on all these missions ? It 's not right . It 's their idea . Who ? The Immortal Council 's ? Nobody outside of the council can be immortal . The public can never know that we have the technology to be able to live forever . It 's something that goes against the very philosophy of a seed ship . So you 're going to send him out for every battle ? To get him killed ? That was the compromise that finally allowed me to convince them . I didn 't want Tanikaze to be imprisoned again . Hiyama . he most certainly won 't die in combat . Just like Saito . we 've finished preparing the Resurrection ritual . We can proceed at any time . Okay . We might even do it tomorrow . What ? The Resurrection ritual ? Are you going to use Ochiai 's auxiliary brain ? At a time like this ? I don 't imagine you 've forgotten what Ochiai did a hundred years ago . Hiyama . we became the first to successfully kill a Gauna . and we agreed to join the Immortal Council . We joined the council so we could help repopulate a new planet . what are you planning on doing ? I 'm not doing this for me . I 'm complying with the request of the anti-military activists . We need to extract terraforming technology from Ochiai . good to see you . welcome back . What 's with her ? That 's weird . she seemed a little more down than usual . She 's not the grumpy sort . Yeah . I have a bad feeling . It 's the same kind I had a hundred years ago . A lot of people are about to die .

We 've finished rescuing the last survivors . Twenty-four council members and 392 citizens . I 'm afraid that 's all that remains of Sidonia . we would have been wiped out . It 's twenty-five council members . You forgot Ochiai . Hiro . Kobayashi . Captured alive ? He 's the one who discarded the Kabizashis . that 's for sure . It 's his fault that Sidonia lost most of the Archive . Most of our accumulated knowledge and technologies gone in an instant . Excuse me .

I didn 't know why Hiroki left . 256 ) } 14 years ago 80 years after the breach The next time he would reappear would be 80 years after he left . Hiroki ! He was discovered collapsed in front of the organic conversion reactor . His aging progressed because he stopped taking his anti-aging medication . His brain will have to be transplanted to a clone immediately . Is there a problem ? all of Mr. Saito 's replacement clones were destroyed in that battle . And he soon disappeared after refusing to administer further clones . he 's fought hard for so long ! He was just tired . If only I had noticed it sooner . Don 't strain yourself . after all . Lalah . that does it ! You know that I hate being called by my first name . Don 't make me bite your head off . you 're so cute . Come on ! Are you sure about this ? but this borders on treason . Our immortality can 't be passed down to our descendants but this replacement clone made from Saito 's manipulated DNA will actually be born immortal . All I know is that we can never lose him again . Stay quiet . you 're ... Take me to where the other me is . Security Chief Hiyama ! Why did Hiroki take Shinatose hostage ? We 're getting audio now ! It 's too soon for him to be taken out ! He 's not even 5 kilograms yet ! That 's a perfectly fine birth weight . you didn 't ! Tell me you didn 't make a clone of Hiroki ! Status on the doors ?

None of you move ! Wait for my orders ! Have you forgotten your pledge to the council ? Did you forget that your life and your death are not yours to decide ? Your experience and knowledge are Sidonia 's . ten years . That 's all I need . I 'll teach the child everything I know . Kobayashi ! Your body has now reached its limit . I won 't take the risk . Put down your weapon . Have negotiations broken down ? This child is mine . Don 't interfere . Get him ! Watch out ! You ... Lalah ! run ! I can 't hold them off for long . Hurry ! It is difficult to find anyone who wanders into one of Sidonia 's many old organic conversion reactors . That was the last time Hiroki was seen . 300 ) } Present Day hurry !

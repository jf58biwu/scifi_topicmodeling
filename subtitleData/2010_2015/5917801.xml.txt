 What 's a Covenant dropship doing here ? Backwater like Sedra ? He 's heading for the city . We think it 's a bomb . She 's been affected by something . Secure the entrances . Only Sedran passports get entrance . I 've got wounded , Colonel . We can talk politics later . What the hell did they do to us ? Covenant 's found their holy grail then , haven 't they ? Way of wiping us out without firing a shot . He says it 's sourced from a place no one will go . He says it 's sourced from hell . Looks like we got a one-off . An element fatal to humans . Native to this little piece of Halo ring and nowhere else . Treaty says no one goes back to the ring . Not UNSC , not Covenant . Daytime temperatures reach 900 degrees . They 're working the night shift . Harvesting the element and they 're long gone before the sun comes up . We destroy the deposits with the Havok , grab our smugglers , be off-planet within hours . Look , you wanna do this tonight , your only option is the Sedrans . I hear you need a ship . All these years heard about the Halo ring . Never thought we 'd actually step foot on it . Won 't be the Halo ring of yore , that 's for sure . Ready to go to hell , Colonel ? - Daddy ? - I heard you 're gonna come home . I made a picture of us at the beach . - Bye , Daddy ! - I miss you . Ever seen a Havok nuke before ? Only virtually . How ' bout battle ? Seen that ? Thing you don 't understand about Sedrans . We 've lived in a state of perpetual war , surrounded by enemies . We were born fighting . That may be . But make a mistake with that you won 't even have time to know you made a mistake . No one in 100 kilometers will . Which is why only we touch it . This is our mission . I don 't wanna hear that again , Lieutenant . This is a Sedran operation . Oh , we 'll be the ones setting the nuke . And probably nabbing the smugglers as advisors . You wanna put a muzzle on your subordinate , Commander Locke ? He 's officially muzzled . He said what he had to say . Well , once we 're boots down , we 'll have roughly eight hours before sunup . Anybody who 's on the surface at that point is dead . Atmosphere 's still breathable but at only 20 % oxygen of what the ring used to have . This is gonna slow us down . Which means oxygen systems and scrubbers for everyone . And lastly I don 't wanna hear anymore proper nous until we exfil . No more " Sedrans " , no " ONI " . Just a team of soldiers . And as commanding officer of this mission that team goes through me , clear ? Clear from this end . We come up against it so you know only guy I listen to is you . Your friend 's wrong about us . We can fight . Not tonight , you won 't . Colonel 's right about you , if you don 't mind me saying . ONI . Think you 're better than everyone else . I mean ... not that you 're not , it 's just ... Well , the only difference between you and any of us is the training . So you think if you went through ONI training , you 'd be just as good ? Maybe even better . That your aspiration ? To be ONI ? Perhaps you 'd rather be a Spartan . She should be neither . You know , he used to be a Spartan . A decade ago maybe . Named Randall-037 . One day , he up and walks away . And no one walks away from the Spartan program . It 's not supposed to be possible . They have too much invested in you . Fast forward 10 years and suddenly I 'm looking at your colonel . Scars like they took a bunch of titanium out of his body . Except his name is not Randall , it 's Aiken . How 's that come to pass ? You 're ONI . You tell me . Come on , Macer . I know better than to trust you . We wouldn 't be doing our job if people trusted us . Commander . Colonel , we 've located the position of the mining tug . Condor will drop us two klicks short of the target , we 'll proceed on foot . Make sure we preserve surprise . As for the Havok , Unless you disagree , Commander , I suggest it stays here till we have our quarry . We can light it up at that point , make sure we 're well out of space by the time it detonates . But not so far that we can 't see it . Something awful mesmerizing about seeing a Havok go up in real time . A fireworks show like none other . Amen to that . On our signal , come to us . Last chance , Colonel . We can do this on our own . We do this as a team . Have it your way , try to keep up . Now drop the lines ! Ropes away . Drop in five . Something about this place freaks me out . Whole thing 's fried . Used to be rivers , forests . Everything living in those forests ... If it was living , it 's dead now . The Forerunners built it 100,000 years ago , and we still don 't totally understand it . Even busted up like it is . Not getting any movement . Best , Wisner , stay 360 on this . I don 't want anybody flanking us . Yes , sir . Got any thoughts on this one , Colonel ? Almost say they ditched , but engine 's still warm . Still functional . I wonder why they deployed the chute . It 's pretty cramped for a two-seater . Question is where our two are . Got something , Locke . Cargo unit . Looks like it got pretty busted up on entry . Jettisoned before landed . Guess they weren 't planning on bringing it back . Horse tracks . Who the hell brings horses ? Couldn 't land the tug near the deposits . Might have been the fastest way out . Fastest way 1000 years ago . Got a cave , Macer . Can you image through this soil ? No , sir . Too thick . Roger that . Stay high and wide of us . I don 't want your engine noise , but I want your eyes . Roger that , sir . Get ready . Humidity level is rising . Got ' em . Twelve o 'clock . M53 non-lethal rounds . I want them incapacitated , not dead . We 've got your ship . There 's no way out . Stand up ! Put down your weapons ! These guys are something else . Put down your weapons , I 'm telling you ! What 's wrong with those horses ? They can smell something . They 're moving . Son of a bitch . Horrigan , Estrin . Colonel , I got ' em . Running east of you . Let 's make this easy , huh ? You have no idea what you 're doing . Shut up and save the bull for the ride out . Not bad for advisors , huh , Colonel ? Nice . - Bring it , Macer , we have our quarry . Roger that . Privates , get the containers . Yes , sir ! Whoa there , boy ! Whoa ! Pull up , sir ! Pull up ! Hell 's going on , Macer ? I don 't know , but pull up ! Talk to me , Condor . What the hell 's going on ? Something 's on me , sir . I 'm losing control of her . The propulsion 's gone . Blown up the engines . Macer . Get down ! It 's gonna hit us ! Fall back ! Take cover ! Stand down . Hold your fire . We 're cloaking . What the hell are they ? The only thing that matters right now is we 're cloaked and they can 't see us . I 'm not so sure about that . Fall back ! Fall back ! Fall back ! We were cloaked . How did they know ? It 's your technology ! It 's like a magnet to them . They sense it . Once they on you , they can even sense your movements . Power down . What ? Do it . Can someone tell me what those things are ? They 're Hunter Worms . Some of us aren 't going to survive the night . Two hours down , two hours to the tug . How do we decide who takes it ? Lifeboat rules . I give you my word . You help us find that craft , you 'll get a fair draw at those straws . That 's a dangerous game you 're playing . Someone 's gotta help him . Stay on mission , Macer .

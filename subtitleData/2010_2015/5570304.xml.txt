 # # Reyaansh # # Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you ? What happened in Tahiti ? Director Fury ... He had a team of scientists working around the clock - I wanted to die . - And we should have let you . Once we capture Quinn , we 'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant . - Where 's Skye ? - Agent Coulson , it 's dangerous ... sending her in like that , all alone . Oh . Oh , god . Hang on . - Put her in there ! - Is it working ? ! We need to get her to a medical facility and fast . 1x14 - T.A.H.I.T.I. She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago . She 's tachycardic , hypotensive , and lost a significant amount of blood . We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here . It 's probably what kept her alive this long . We 'll do everything we can . - Oh , dear . I 'm a mess . - No . You were great . Intubate , and let 's start getting that shirt off . Okay , let 's prep her for ex-lap . I 'm here . That 's unacceptable . I need to speak to Director Fury immediately , please . Why didn 't I stop her ? - I could have . - As if you could stop Skye doing anything she 's set her mind to . I shouldn 't have let her go after Quinn by herself . What was I thinking ? It 's not your fault . She shouldn 't have been there . I 'm her S.O. It 's on me . The one to blame is the man who shot her , Ian Quinn . He 's responsible . Yes , the message is , I have an agent dying , and there are questions only he can answer . - How is she ? - Not good . The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines . We resected what we could , but ... - there 's been too much damage . - So what 's next ? We can keep her comfortable , but you 'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support . You 're saying there 's nothing to be done ? I 'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible . We 're her family . In that case , I 'm very sorry . Finally . I was beginning to think you 'd forgotten ... Ohh . Wait ! You can 't ! Why ? 'Cause you 're defenseless , like she was ? May ! May ! Outside , now . He deserves to die , not her ! Agreed . But right now , Quinn doesn 't matter ... only Skye does , and I need you to pilot the plane . You heard what the doctor said . She said there was nothing more they could do for her , but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead . If they can do that , I 'm betting they can save Skye . # # Reyaansh # # H.Q. radioed in . They 've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge . Do you want me to arrange the transfer ? No . Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise . Yes , sir . Are you sure about this , taking her all the way to Bethesda ? It 's where my file says I was treated after New York . I understand , but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different ? - I know they saved you , but ... - They did a lot more than save me . It 's time you know the truth . That can 't be . What you 're describing ... it 's medically impossible . Except for the fact that I 'm standing here ... proof that it 's not impossible . And here 's more proof ... my file , describing how they brought me back ... the doctors , the procedures , the drugs . Sir ... it 's against the law for us to read this . - Are you sure ? - I don 't care about your clearance level . I 'm ordering you to read it . " Death and recovery report . " It 's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this . I 've gone over it dozens of times . I need you to decipher the medical parts of it I didn 't understand . Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten . He should be eager to answer any questions you may have . Yes , I 'm sure I 'll have quite a few . - So , what about Tahiti ? - Turns out , not so magical , just false memories implanted to cover up what was done . Sir ... it says here your heart was perforated , torn in half . That part of it I understood . And yet , they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely . We need to understand how . - So we can do the same for Skye . - That 's what I 'm counting on . - We 'll get right on it , sir . - Thank you . - Hurt much ? - I 'm fine . Coulson told me how long he was dead . But you already knew that , didn 't you ? I saw Skye ... in the pod , machines filtering her blood , breathing for her . I 'm not sure I 'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle . If Coulson thinks there 's a chance in a million to save Skye , to save any of us , he 'd take it . People like us ... we need people like him . So , yeah , it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative . - You mean giving up ? - Or killing the man responsible . I did like seeing you go after Quinn . You don 't open the blinds like that very often . S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 , this is tower Michael Tango . You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297 . - Respond immediately . - Disobeying a direct order . We didn 't hand Quinn over for interrogation . Great . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616 . How do we proceed ? Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command . Really ? All the war and chaos in the world , and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us ? Three planes ... a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn . If they scratched my paint , I 'm gonna be pissed . I 'll await your orders , sir . Garrett ? What the hell are you doing here ? Well , as opposed to the level 8 jackass I 'm staring at , - I still follow orders . - You 're the worst at following orders . Maybe ... but I like this one . You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge . Agent Antoine Triplett , Agent Phillip Coulson . You wouldn 't know it to look at him , but Phil 's one of our finest . An honor , sir . Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus . - Go secure the prisoner . - Yes , sir . Phil , come on . Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn 't mean they won 't shoot it out of the sky . Why are you really here , Garrett ? S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn . Why you ? - You 've been chasing him , too ! - Since Malta . Then yesterday , your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work . - You can 't have him , not yet . - This isn 't a request . Quinn shot one of my agents . She 's on life support in a med pod downstairs . We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda . Quinn actually pulled the trigger ? Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta . When he saw her yesterday , seems he took it personally . I never took him for a triggerman . He pays others for that . I 've lost three of my own chasing him . Then you understand why I can 't give him to you until we save my agent . Because if she doesn 't make it ... - Agent Grant Ward . - Trip . - Is Garrett upstairs ? - Yeah . You know , he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung . It was 2,000 . So , what are you doing here ? Man , this is like the Playboy jet . I mean , a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this . How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride ? - He died . - That 's tight . You want to point me to the box you 're keeping Quinn ? H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning . - Is that a full bar ? - You 're welcome to it . But , uh , Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise . Come on , man . Garrett was your S.O. , too , so you know how this works . - Why don 't you remind me ? - Garrett wants Quinn . It 's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants . - Now where is he ? - Can 't help you with that . No worries . I 'll find Quinn myself . I 'm sure he 's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court . Hey . Agent Ward , stand down . Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement . He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda . Well , I 'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be . You wouldn 't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into . - Good seeing you , son . - You , too , sir . And thank you . Saving the girl 's top priority , and she might know something . I 've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ... GH-325 ? And what about this robotic-assisted - neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories ? - It all sounds so diabolical . - I agree . We can 't argue with the results . He 's walking around . Yeah but at what cost ? You read the transcripts . He begged the doctors to let him die . This is different . Skye 's still alive . We have to keep her that way . Oh . I 've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us . Hello . Yes . Are you sure ? That can 't be . And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop . Ian Quinn , this is Agent Garrett . - He 's here to ask you some questions . - Oh , no , thank you . I ... my head 's still ringing from the last visitor . At least the last visitor left you with a head . I 'm not always that considerate . I 'm interested in one of your newer projects . Hmm ? Oh , but there are so many to choose from . Let me be clear ... you have no rights . You have no lawyer . The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs , and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions . Is that clear ? Mm-hmm . - You understand that ? - No . Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program . - Deathlok ? - Catchy , right ? Sounds like some wrestler from the ' 80s . What is it really ? Those are dangerous waters , and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach . So ... she 's still alive ? Yeah . And you better hope she stays that way . Is that why you shot Skye , because she saw what Cybertek delivered ? No . I shot Skye because that 's what the Clairvoyant told me to do . You wanted to see me ? I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda . Dr. Streiten 's gone off the grid . So we 'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson . - That 's the thing . Actually ... - Coulson was never treated there . - You 're not making sense . - None of this makes sense . The doctors listed , the operating-room number ... none of them exist . None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D. What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo . Oh , I doubted it at the beginning , but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial . He must have something pretty terrible on you . Shooting an unarmed girl ? Let 's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest . Yet ... here you are . Let me assure you it wasn 't luck that led me to your partner 's black sedan in Berlin or that he 'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco . Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad ? No , it was the Clairvoyant . Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in ? The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him . This is still about me . Wait . You 're gonna need to rewind the tape , Phil . You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York ? There 's more to it than that . I thought I was gone for seconds ... - turns out it was days . - That 's impossible . Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened . - Even order you to shoot Skye . - Wait . You don 't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you . That 's why we 're flying to where I was treated . So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out . - So the Clairvoyant can finally see . - Or you let the girl die . Quinn shot Skye for nothing . The place we were going , the doctors who treated you ... - they don 't exist . - Or maybe they exist somewhere else . This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets . That 's my fear , sir . Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs , unknown surgical procedures we 've never even heard of . Frankly , Fitz and I only understand about 70 % of what 's in here . Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure , there 's the other obvious question . - Which is ? - Whether we should . What you experienced , sir , if this file is even partially accurate ... No one 's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through , but if there 's something in here ... a drug , a treatment that can save her , we need to find it . - Figure it out . - Yes , sir . - You disagree . - No . I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye . But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants . It 's a risk we have to take . How is she ? Deteriorating , and I don 't know how to stop it . The only thing I 've found remotely interesting - is something called " GH-325 . " - Some kind of drug ? Agent Coulson was injected with that , and literally minutes later , his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration . Regeneration ? Is that even possible ? Even if this miracle drug does exist , we don 't know where to find it . We have no coordinates , no logs of anyone 's departure or arrival . I think maybe I can help with that . - You 've set up the echo-chamber . - Yeah , I made a couple of calls . A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion . Agreed to let us access it from here . Hard to believe , but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s historical administrative data . Yeah , but if Agent Coulson 's operation didn 't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ... We won 't find any record of it here ... I know . But this also contains all interoffice memos , travel arrangements , purchase orders . Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another . Yeah . Okay . Well , let 's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed . Here we go . Or , um , what about Dr. Streiten 's departure from the Triskelion ? - Maybe they have that . - Yeah . - Here . This is interesting . - A World War II bunker ? " Collapsed " bunker . Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility . - " The Guest House " ? - Exactly . Guest House ... G.H. GH-325 . Look at the file 's access history . - The only record of it being opened ... - Is by a level 10 operative . Director Fury . So , Fury 's been to this place , and he 's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson . And why aren 't you trying to find the file ? Ah , damn . Encrypted . Skye could crack this . What would she do ? It 's not an encryption . The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility . We don 't know who or what 's in there . - Be prepared for potential resistance . - No contact from inside ? I 've tried every known channel ... no response . - Place could be abandoned . - Let 's hope not . We need the people inside to work on Skye . Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment 's notice , sir . Trip can help . He 's had med-tech training . Good . We do our jobs right , this will all go peacefully . - What if they don 't want to help us ? - I 'll say " pretty please . " We need the doctors alive and the place intact . If it does go sideways , Fitz , I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye . And then we take it . Let 's move . Company ? Nothing 's scheduled for a couple weeks . Try the protocol . How was the drive from Istanbul ? - Countersign ? - No clue . - Never heard it . - I can 't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s protocol directives . This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D. We don 't know the counter , but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance . We know she can be treated here . Open the doors . Maybe we can work something out . Do you copy ? How was the drive from Istanbul ? We 're looking for medical assistance . A person 's life is at stake . Will you help us ? How was the drive from Istanbul ? " Pretty please " it is . These guys are good ... hacked their way in . How the hell did they find this place ? Doesn 't matter . Didn 't know the countersign . - You want left or right ? - Left 's good . There 's an antechamber and a set of glass doors . Can 't see much beyond that . Lights are all out . Well , they know we 're coming . Let 's go say " hello . " Clear . Okay , Simmons , we 're going in now . Simmons ? Damn it . Comms are down . There 's too much mountain on top of us . Trust me ... it 's better . You don 't want them hearing the horrible death we 're walking into . Humor , son . You Brits are too serious . - Besides , if the job was easy ... - It wouldn 't be any fun . I 'm not afraid ... not yet . I suspect the real danger won 't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass . Probably a stairwell back to the surface . What do you think , Fitz ? Can you get us inside ? To certain , horrible death ? Absolutely . Okay , sir , just say the word . Once we get inside , everybody find cover . All right , gentlemen , here we go . We 've come for medical assistance . But you continue firing on us , we will defend oursel ... - I count two hostiles . - Copy that . Ready ? You got one of those little flash things ? Yeah . Ward ! Clear ! - See if you can get some lights on . - Yeah . No hard feelings , Bob . Clear . We 're not done . This one 's hit . Shouldn 't be too hard to find . Go . We 're gonna get you medical help . Is anyone else down here ? Where are the doctors ? Med staff doesn 't stay here . We 're looking for a drug ... GH-325 . It might help you , too . - Do I ... k-know you ? - I don 't know . I-I might have spent some time here awhile back . Then you know about ... the timer . We got a problem ! Semtex . The whole place is rigged to blow . There 's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us . Sir . Less than 10 minutes . It 's probably a failsafe . If the guards had eliminated us , they 'd stop the timer . Since they didn 't ... It 's some kind of emergency override . Skye could probably get past it , but I can 't hack the panel , which means we 're trapped in here . You 're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs . Figure out a way to get us out of here . Let 's go find the drug . So this is some sort of medical facility . Yeah , but if nobody 's here , I 'm not sure it 's gonna do us any good . Tough when it 's your team . You guys go back a ways ? Not really . A few months . We have nothing in common ... couldn 't be more different . But you can 't imagine your life without her . Yes . You 've experienced that , Agent Triplett ? I have . Sometimes , a person takes you by surprise . Yeah . She 's very lucky to have you . I know anything bad ever happens to me , hope you 're in my corner , too . Comms are down . If I don 't hear anything within the hour , I 'm going after them . Skye 's coding . Both of you , now . How can we help ? I need a unit of Epi . Got it . Don 't . Let me die . Please . Let me die ! - Is that where ... - Yeah . The timer doesn 't control the explosion . It 's just a clock . Detonator must be somewhere else . It 's not in here , or I 'd have found it . There 's no time to search the whole compound . Maybe we can take some semtex , use it on the doors . Sir , are you sure you want to ? We should put suits on before we go in there . You 're right , but there 's no time . I wish I could speak to Simmons . She 'd know what most of this stuff is ... or , at least , what stuff not to touch . Uh ... Fitz . Oh . I don 't see any G.H ... Agent Coulson . It 's locked . Here . Put these on . Got it . Time to go . We couldn 't stop it . Four minutes and counting . Almost there . There 's semtex throughout here , as well . This is it ... 325 . - This is the one we want . - We gotta go . - Get it up to Simmons . - Yeah . Sir . I 'll be right behind you . Go . Three minutes . Have you worked much with munitions , Agent Fitz ? Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting . Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years . Guess we don 't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place . Agent Ward ... would you do the honors ? Thought you 'd never ask . Can you slip through ? - Yeah . - Go . All right . Get that drug up there . - Coulson . - Where the hell is he ? Phil ! Go with Fitz . Make sure that drug gets to the girl . - Agent Garrett . - Go ! Save the girl . Weak , erratic heart rate . Each time we save her , I ask myself , " is this what Skye would want ? " We didn 't come this far to quit . Get off ... the ground immediately . They 're alive . Maybe we can ... Fitz , come in . What 's your status ? Phil ! Phil , what the hell ? Clock 's not slowing down . - It 's about to get really warm in here . - Hey , you with me ? The guys are out already . They took the drug up to Skye . No , don 't give it to her . The drug ... they can 't give it to her ! All right . You can tell them yourself . Right now , we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground . Now let 's go . You want more epinephrine ? - We found it . - What is it ? And how much , injected where ? May , get us off the ground , or it 'll fall out from under us . No ! Don 't give it to her ! I was losing her , anyway . What harm can it do ? Come on , girl . It 's working . She 's spiking . Stop it . How can we stop it ? Skye ! - What 's happening ? - I don 't know ... Skye ! Do something ... we have to do something ! Her heartbeat ... she 's stabilizing . Simmons ? Could someone tell me what we just saw ? The girl 's a fighter . What was that stuff you just gave her ? I don 't know . All I know is that it worked . You 're a real miracle worker . You did it . Something happen down there ? I 'm not sure . One minute , he was fine . The next , it was like he had seen a ghost . I have good news and bad news . Which would you like to hear first ? Bad news , then ... there 's a fair amount . Your Clairvoyant , the one who said he 'd have your back ... he 's a no-show . The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces , buried under 100 feet of rock . It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich , entitled dirtbag he 's gonna get away with murder , he 'll believe it . Trip . Girl 's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach . Oh , we got a great little home movie of you admitting that , genius . This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot . - You said there was good news . - I did ? Oh , yeah . You still have your tongue . Let 's go . I want to thank you , Garrett , for letting us keep Quinn on the plane . Don 't mention it . There 's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long , living hell . I 'm counting on it . - Something I need to ask you , Phil . - Of course . - We 've known each other a long time . - Yes , we have . Been in our share of tight spots together . If it had gone the other way ... if Skye hadn 't survived , were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane ? You were the one who made that threat . I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile . You 're right . It was me . - My mistake . - Till next time . Might be sooner than you think . My man Trip 's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours . Do you mind ? You did the impossible today . You saved Skye 's life . Why aren 't you happy about it ? They told me you were yelling ... to not use the drug , to not use it on Skye . Why ? What made you change your mind ? Phil ? Phil ! You all right ? Being down there ... seeing where I came from ... I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did . But she didn 't . For whatever reason ... she didn 't . " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " will return in a moment . I 'm gonna go see if they have a map . I 'll be waiting in the car , Mrs. Mackenzie . - Are you okay ? - No . No , I 'm parched and weary . Is all of Midgard so desolate ? Midgard ? I don 't know where that is . - This is Death Valley . - Oh . I seek passage from this ... valley of death to a more bountiful land . I wish I could help , but ... it 's built for two . Y-you should ask the manager inside . Uh , maybe there 's a bus later today . - She 's your bride ? - Yep , since yesterday morning . And you prefer her to me ? Well ... yeah . I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone . That 's why I married her ... together forever . Loyalty ... I admire that in a man . I am going to need your help ... if I am to remain free . Jimmy ! I swear to protect you and keep you safe , but I don 't even know your name . It 's Lorelei . My name is Lorelei . # # Reyaansh # #

 It would seem our fates are on a collision course . Find Dyson Frost yesterday . The next move is Marck Benford 's . Dyson Frost ? It 's your move . I took this picture . She saw something she shouldn 't have And got in trouble with Jericho . The second that Jericho knows that I 'm still alive ... ( grunts ) - They 'll find me , and they 'll kill me . - Tracy Stark ... I know you took her . Now you 're gonna give her back . - I can 't give you your daughter back . - Then we go to war . You will be shot 3 times on March 15th . - It will be your gun , Agent Benford . - Demetri ? - Yeah ? - The box is here , but the gun is gone . My first term was a bitch . I could have used you , Stan . I 'm sorry I couldn 't bring you in . I don 't want you to think I-I 'm harassing you . I know . You 're just trying to save the world . Good-bye . She was signaling her handlers . ( firing ) ( Simon ) I should have known ... two moles , In case one is caught ... and not one person in the office Would suspect it 's you . ( Mark ) Today is more than just the beginning of your career . Today , along with a badge and a gun , You 're gonna get a story about your first day on the job . Every special Agent has one . Some are funny . Some are tragic . Some are boring . But today won 't be the most important day In your career as an FBI Agent . That day is somewhere down the line . You won 't see it coming . It sneaks up on you . It 'll most likely be an anonymous moment ... A crossroads where you 're asked to do something , Make some kind of personal sacrifice For the good of someone else , and that person may never know Your name or see your face or even understand what you did . But you 'll know . And isn 't that why you 're here , after all ? Because you can be counted on to do the right thing At the right time , every time . Welcome to the FBI . Well done . Nicely done . All right , ladies and gentlemen . See me for your partner assignments . Congratulations . - ( Wedeck ) Nicely done . - ( Demetri ) special Agent Vreede ... Is it " vreed-y " or " Vreede " as in " freed " ? Oh , I don 't know . I got Benford . No . Switch with me . - Why ? - He 's a legend . He 's done it all ... Surveillance , counterterrorism , trafficking . Come on . - Do it . - Whatever , but you gotta take it up with Wedeck and get it approved . Done . Thank you . - Of course . - Yes ! - Janis , who 'd you get ? - No partner . Headed to analysis . Boring . You know , I got it worse . I report to you . ( chuckles ) ( laughs ) I mean , how could that be ? I scored higher . Yeah , in , like , one category . - Come on , Marcie . We 'll have fun . - Yeah , we 've been a team since quantico ... - Booze and bullets . - Yeah , well , what am I , the mascot ? No , you 're like our Captain . Yeah , you 'll probably outpace all of us . I 'm sure of it . Yeah , we 're ... we 're sure . ( beep , door opens ) ( door closes ) ( Mark ) Interview of Marcie Turoff , Agents Benford and Noh questioning . March 12 , 2010 . First thing we 'd like to know is ... Who came after us in that parking garage in D.C. ? I don 't know . Who came after us in the parking garage in D.C. ? I don 't know . On to the next . Are they still after us ? - I don 't know . - Demetri . - Who killed Ian McKinnon ? - Come on . Let 's go . - Is that who 's coming after me ? - Let 's go . We need those answers . Yeah , but there are a whole lot of other ones we need to get to first . Listen , Dem . You think I don 't have March 15th circled in my calendar , too ? We both know there 's a chance you 'll die in three days . Look , you keep chasing down leads . I 'll let you know when we 're ready for your questions , alright ? Hey , Janis , I need your help in here with Marcie . Me ? What , you got something more important than grilling our mole ? No . Of course not . What were your duties ? Every week , I 'd take whatever information there was In the mosaic investigation and leave it at a dead drop . Who recruited you ? I was approached by a man three months before the blackout hit . What was his name ? All in due time . He asked if I wanted to be a part of something big . And you said yes . You think I sold out my friends and my country , but ... You don 't know me . Why don 't you enlighten us ? Come on . Don 't you remember my flash-forward ? No , you don 't , 'cause neither of you ever bothered to ask me what I saw . ( whoosh ) I was incarcerated . That didn 't cross your mind When you shot six of your fellow agents ? ( firing ) It did . But even though I was in jail , I was happier than I 've been in years . ( whoosh ) I thought we 'd have to beg for life without parole . I told you they 'd come around . Until I tell them who recruited me , I 'm indispensable . For the first time since I got here , I actually felt like I was important . ( Wedeck ) I need you , Mark . These are our guests from Washington . And while they 're grateful for all our efforts - In apprehending Agent Turoff ... - Oh , no . You gotta be kidding . Director Middleton feels more comfortable Having such a highly valued target where he can keep an eye on her . And where he can give the press conferences himself . Hear me out . We know her . We can read her . Just give us one more day . I know it 's frustrating , But let 's try to get something positive done today ... Like maybe get back to what caused the blackout . Now I 'll be out of the office for a couple of hours , So give me an update . Dyson Frost ... He 's our best lead so far . Where are we ? I 've left four messages . Haven 't heard back . I 'm afraid he 's just toying with us . The guy 's been wanting to talk to you for 19 years , And now he 's playing hard to get ? Shel , see what you can get by tracing Frost 's phone . Yes , sir . Hey , I just got a call from l.A.P.D. They 've got a ballistics report saying that Mark 's gun , The one that 's supposed to kill me in three days , Was used in a murder last night . ( siren wailing in distance ) ( Mark ) So what do we know from the eyewitness reports ? 55-year-old , in his cot , Presumably asleep . At 3 : 33 A.M. , the shooter walked up to him , And a couple of insomniacs heard the victim say ... I knew it would be you . I just didn 't want to believe . The shooter must have had a silencer on your gun . ( muffled shots fire ) ( gasps ) He plugged him three times in the chest at close range . Uh , do you want to put that thing away ? - Sorry . - Thanks . Physical description ranging from ... 5 ' 5 " white guy to a 6 ' Indian . Another dead end . Wasn 't there something about a car ? Uh ... Somebody said they saw a 1970s blue sedan drive away ... Foreign make . That 's a start . ( scoffs ) L.A.P.D. ' s gonna forward the victim 's effects to us . Can 't wait to sift through that . Forget about the shooter . Who 's the one other person we know who handled that gun ? There were 40 agents in that evidence room . They were all cleared months ago . One of those agents Marcie ? ( jet engines roaring ) ( Demetri ) Marcie ! - Stop ! Stop ! - You guys never give up . - I need to talk to her . - She 's in our custody now . You can 't take her . She 's part of our investigation . I 'm just doing my job , same as you doing yours . - Who 'd you give my gun to , Marcie ? - I don 't know . - Come on . Who has it ? - I don 't know . Come on . Don 't do this . We were friends . Look , I 'm sorry . Really , I am . All I heard is that you 're supposed to die in L.A. What ? Give me more specifics . - Who does it ? When ? - It was a voice on the phone When I called to report the gun in lockup . Who 'd you call ? A number . It was different every time . Look , that 's all I know . There isn 't any more . Look , you 're gonna die in three days , And there 's nothing you can do to stop it . I 'm sorry . - Come on . - Marcie , come on . Marcie ! Marcie ! Marcie ! ( children shouting indistinctly ) ( Charlie ) Come on , come on ! Sweetie , what is the hurry ? We 're here . I told him we 'd be here by 2 : 00 . We 're late . - Who ? - Dylan ! ( Charlie ) Hey , Dylan . Nuts to you , squirrlio ! Toot ! Toot ! - Come on , Dylan ! - Okay , I 'm coming . Did you know about this ? Absolutely not . Charlie , who arranged this ? I did ! I got Dylan 's phone number from him When he was in the hospital . He was very insistent about this specific park , And now I know why . Do you normally come here ? Well , the house is just around the corner . Right . ( Charlie laughing ) - This is fun . - Come on . You go first . - Look , I can sit on a bench or something . - It 's fine . Doesn 't have to be that way . ( Charlie screaming and crying ) Charlie ? - Dylan , what happened ? - Let me see , sweetie . - We bonked heads . - Did he hit your teeth ? Let me see , baby . Okay , Charlie , let 's see . Open up . - I 'm bleeding . - Okay . Let me see . - She okay ? - Open your mouth . Here we go , Charlie . I want you to do something now . Just grab my hand , and when it hurts , I want you to squeeze as hard as possible , okay ? Is that all you got ? Come on . You try a little bit harder than that . That 's good . Does this mean I can 't go to the carnival , mommy ? No , I think you 're gonna be just fine for the carnival . I think you 're gonna be okay . Yeah , that 's good . I 'm starting to feel that a bit now . Listen , I 'm just gonna go back to the car and get a bottle of water and a towel . - You 'll be okay . - Okay . Yeah . I see carnivals in your future . Come here . I wanna go . I know . Come here . It 's okay , sweetie . Assistant director Wedeck ? That 's me . Come this way . - She 's ready for you . - Thank you . Madame vice president . ( sighs ) Good to see you , Stan . It 's been quite a while . - Please sit . - Thank you . ( sighs ) Thanks for coming on such short notice , Stan . How is everything ? You want to tell me why the hell you dragged me out here ? ( chuckles ) It 's nice to know my new position Hasn 't changed your attitude towards me . Does the name Jericho ring a bell ? They 're a private contractor operating over in Afghanistan . I 've heard of them . Agent Benford look into them a while back . Yes ? Well , in my security briefing this morning , I learned that Jericho 's C.E.O. just tripled the security Around his malibu compound . I think you should take a look . Wrong department . NSA is who you want to call . I don 't want them to know . I need this done off the books . The vice president doesn 't fly across the country 'cause some guy hired an extra night watchman . ( sighs ) In my vision , it was clear that Jericho had done some things That threatened our national security . The same vision where you saw yourself as president ? ( whoosh ) As a matter of fact , yes . And I was there because Jericho Did something that triggered a political crisis . I can 't find out anything about what they 're doing . But if it 's bad enough to bring down president segovia , It must be significant . I 've been keeping a close eye on every move they make , And something is happening right now . Are you sure you don 't know what it is ? And even if I did , Dave and I go back 25 years . Listen , these flash-forwards are coming true . Segovia is going down . Do you want to be out with the old or in with the new ? Well now we know your gun 's here in L.A. Yeah , too bad Marcie couldn 't tell us who 's using it . So I 'll run this car info , See if anything pings on a 1970s blue sedan . - We 're gonna get this guy . - Yeah . Got a sec , Mark ? Jericho ... You used our database to look into them a few months ago . Is that a problem ? No , no . Just curious why you did . It was a favor for a friend ... Wanted as much information as I could give him , which wasn 't a lot . A friend ? Do all your friends ask you To research third world military contractors ? He had questions about his daughter 's death . She was serving in Afghanistan . He thinks Jericho is involved ? The things he told me ... they were in confidence . Oh . I can respect that . Thanks . Do you mind if I talk with him ? Maybe ask him a few questions ? What 's his name ? Aaron Stark . Good luck finding him . He 's off the grid . I don 't even know where he is - Or how to track him down . - Thank you , Mark . Sure . Hey . Just heard on the scanner ... L.A.P.D. ' s in the middle of a high-speed Chase . Driver ... ross webber ... has been spotted with a gun . Car they 're following ... '71 blue sedan . The shooter from the homeless shelter ? How many criminals are driving the same disco era sedans , right ? Any idea where they 're headed ? ( tires screech ) ( Mark ) There 's your blue sedan . ( men speaking indistinctly ) Where is he ? Right inside . A bunch of people ran out . He 's got hostages . - Where in the building is he ? - Second floor . - Who 's talking to him ? - No one yet . You think he 's just gonna come out on his own ? Captain doesn 't want us to do anything till he gets here . ( man ) Shots fired ! Get down ! Stay down ! ( woman screaming , officer shouting indistinctly ) ( whispering ) You hang back . I talk to him , try to make sure he releases the hostage . - Once he does , you take your shot . - Sounds good , Except for the part about me staying on the sidelines . No way you 're going down there . Listen , I 'm not gonna let that gun kill one more person . March 15th ... I know that 's the day you 're supposed to die . Who says you didn 't get shot three days earlier ? ( man ) Who the hell is that ? ! ( normal voice ) I 'm right here ! ( lowers voice ) Try not to shoot me . - Oh ! - Stop . ( normal voice ) Oh . I told them the only person I want to talk to is Randy Savage ! Macho man ? Yeah , I dig that . Uh , that 's not me . My name 's Demetri . Oh , God ! ( crying ) You don 't turn around in four seconds , I will kill her , Demetri . Doesn 't matter to me . She 's just a saleswoman . That 's what she gets for causing the blackout . - I said stop ! - Okay . Ross , you still have that gun , right ? I 'm gonna take the clip off now . Here we go . Gone , buddy . And , uh ... ( gasps ) On my ankle , I got a gun , man . I 'm gonna take that off , too , okay ? We 're not worrying about that anymore . ( crying ) Hey , what were you saying , though , about ... About how salespeople caused the blackout ? That 's ... That 's a fascinating theory . I 'd like to hear more about it . They made us buy cell phones . Uh-huh . See , before everybody had a cell phone , Nobody ever blacked out . None of this ever ... stop moving ! ( screams ) Okay . You think I won 't kill you ? You 're about just plain incorrect . ( creaking ) ( whimpering ) I 'm not afraid . ( woman crying ) It 's okay . Everybody 's scared of dying , man . ( crying ) She is . Look at her ... I 'm scared of dying ... All three of us . It 's what makes us human , don 't you think ? You 're scared . That 's fine . See , when people get scared , judgment gets clouded . I 'll be honest , man . You have made some really bad decisions today . But you can make a really good one , right now ... If you just give me the gun . Ross . Come on . Let me save your life . ( screams ) Uhh ! ( woman wailing ) ( gasping ) E.M.T. says he 's stable . We can question him in the hospital . It 's not your gun . Serial number is totally different . Your gun 's still out there . So you almost got yourself killed for nothing ? Yeah , I guess so . All right . You took him down , Saved an innocent woman . That 's fantastic work . What I can 't understand is , If you thought that gun was gonna kill you , I mean ... Cops had the place surrounded . He was never gonna make it out ofere anyway . That 's why I needed to get to him , man ... So I could ask him why . Ugh . Do you remember ... That speech you gave my first day on the job ? It was all about being the kind of ... Person ... Who could be counted on To do the right thing at the right time . And , man , since October 6th , when I didn 't see anything , I have had a lot of trouble being that person . And I need your help . Why ? ( chuckles ) I mean , look at me . If you think I 've been making good choices lately , You 're crazier than I thought . I 'll do anything to help you , Demetri , so ... I 'm gonna tell you something , and ... I really want you to listen . Get out of here . You and Zoey just get out of here . ( whispers ) I 'm not running away . That 's right . You 're not . You 're being smart . Just promise me you 'll go somewhere safe . ( horns honk ) ( Zoey ) Special Agent Noh , do you recognize exhibit " h " ? Yes . It 's a copy of my notes Taken while witnessing the transaction . And those handwritten notes are your only record of the events ? Well , it was a very simple money-for-stolen-goods exchange . Hmm . Wow . That is very good . Agent Noh , who taught you to draw ? I guess I 'm just naturally artistic . Wow . Lucky guy , right ? Now your description here Of the alleged buyer ... oh , here , further down in your notes ... Can you read that for the court , please ? Uh , " caucasian male , average height / weight , Dark jacket , baseball cap . " Hmm . When my client was booked , He was photographed wearing a red jacket , not a dark one , wasn 't he ? Yes . And he clearly has a goatee , does he not , Agent Noh ? - Yes . - So which individual ... bought the stolen computer disk , Agent Noh ... The one with the goatee ... Or the one in your artistic notes ? Because they 're obviously not the same person . - Objection ... argumentative . - Sustained . - Do I get to answer that ? - Not really . No further questions . I 'm done with this witness . Oh , you can go now . Come on . There 's no need to take it personally . That was a win that you just turned into a loss . ( chuckles ) It was never really a win , because you were wrong . Wow . You know what ? Um , I 'm gonna go ahead and take the stairs . You know what ? Look , I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I will turn the defense attorney off . Okay , that would be an instant improvement . Why don 't you let me make it up to you ? Can I ... Take you to dinner ? Ha ! You gotta be kidding me . What ? There 's not a chance in hell I would ever go out with you . ( plate scrapes ) - Hey . ( silverware clinking ) - Hey . How are you ? ( kisses ) Good . Sit down . I want to talk to you . It 's okay . Wow . You 're beautiful . Shut up . What is wrong with you ? Nothing . ( claps hands ) It 's good . You know , I wasn 't supposed to be there that day . What day ? Al Gough was supposed to be Mark 's partner . I switched with him , and because I was Mark 's partner , I was covering the bust that led me to you . All these tiny little decisions we make , you know , Without thinking , they ... they all ... They all line up to lead us somewhere ... - Somewhere good . - Yeah . So I want to ask you if you will ... Marry me . ( laughs ) Baby , we covered this . I-I said yeah . - No , I want to get married right now . - Okay . I want to get married tomorrow . Then we get on a plane and we go to Hawaii . We stay there through the 15th , maybe through April 29th . Listen , maybe we don 't ever come home . - Want to do it ? - Are you serious ? - I 'm serious . - Hell , yes ! Yes ? Of course ! Oh , I love you . Mm . ( dogs barking in distance ) ( knocks on door ) Hey . Hi . I ... sorry . I just wanted to come by and say thanks for ... What you did with Charlie today in the park . Okay , um ... No problem . Well , thank you . Can I ... can I get you to come in ? I just left the water running , but please , please come in . Sure . ( door closes ) I 'm sorry . The dishes were getting kind of out of control . Can I get you something to drink ? Um , I could offer you a carton of milk that expired yesterday , Some juice boxes or a bottle of gin . No . No , I think I ... I think I should be going . - Really ? - Yeah . Thank you for today . Yeah , I do have a telephone . You could 've called to say thank you . Olivia ... Why are you here ? I don 't know . I 've just made such a mess of things . I wish I could blame it all on Mark , but I really can 't . I made a ton of mistakes . I know that feeling . I tried my best with Linda after Dylan was born , but ... To be honest , I-I used his autism As an excuse to get away from her . Even the thought of that makes me ashamed now . I thought I was doing the right thing at the time . You 're damned if you do , And then you 're damned if you don 't . Yeah , maybe we just ... Choose to live in the moment , you know , just grab the ... Good things in our life when we recognize them . - I have to go . - Look . Wait . I 'm not trying to argue against Mark . He 's a brave man doing something extraordinary . Yeah , he is . ( sighs ) This does kind of put me in a ... Lancelot-trying-to-persuade-Guinevere position . Oh , you did not just compare yourself to Lancelot . ( chuckles ) ( chuckles ) Yeah , well , the only other metaphor I had Involved protons and neutrons , and believe me , Under the circumstances , I went with the stronger choice . I know that we 're feeling the same thing right now . ( lowers voice ) How do you know what I 'm feeling ? Because I 'm in that room on April the 29th . That wasn 't an accident . ( whoosh ) ( whoosh ) ( whispers ) This scares me . It should . Who the hell are you ? It 's okay , Aaron . I work with Mark . I 'm a friend . ( horn honks ) You mind telling me how you found me ? There was a computer in Echo Park doing Web searches For a " jericho parwan Afghanistan , " " Jericho central base " And " Jericho murder U.S. Soldiers . " That library 's 2 miles from here . And this is the 14th cash-only hotel I 've hit . Well , here I am . Now what ? Mark didn 't want to tell me why you were so interested in Jericho . But some very powerful people would love to take them down . All they need is proof . They got my daughter . - They kill her ? - They tried . She 's still alive . - But in your file it ... - Tracy 's alive . She was here , but Jericho found her and took her back to Afghanistan . I gotta believe I 've only got so much time left to find her . Wait . You 're ... you 're ... you 're going to Afghanistan ? Sure am . I know you were in the service and everything , But how are you planning on getting there ? Fly into Uzbekistan , cross the border at Termez . And you 're doing this with a U.S. Passport ? - Yeah . - You 'll be dead before you leave Hairaton . I don 't have a choice . Do you know why Jericho tried to kill your daughter two years ago ? She saw Jericho wipe out an entire village . If I could help you get to Tracy ... Do you think she would tell us the whole story ? ( sighs ) ( Janice ) Really ? You can do that legally ? - Hey , Demetri . Come here . - What ? Come here . - Yo , I 'm getting married . - ( chuckles ) Come here . I 'm getting married . So would you be okay with Vreede officiating at your wedding ? Define " okay . " No charge . ( chuckles ) Consider it my wedding gift . Whoa . You 're gonna marry him ? ( Janis ) Vreede 's an Internet minister . Have I ever told you how awesome you are , Shelly Vreede ? - ( Janis ) Ohh . - You make me feel loved . - Janis , you 're awesome , too . - Oh , thank you . Janis is awesome . That 's very sweet . Thank you . - ( Vreede ) All right . - Mark is awesome . - Time to take the groom home . - Yeah . Let 's find a cab . - Here we go , buddy . - All right . Oh . Okay , I 'm sleepy . - ( Janis ) yeah . - Good night . You got military clearance . Your cover is you 're in Afghanistan to help install their power grid . ( beep ) Satellite phone . Video capability . As soon as you can document what Tracy knows , I want it uploaded . If you see any Jericho activity , I want it uploaded ... Pictures , video , audio , anything you can get me . No problem . Get yourself to Bagram as soon as you 're clear . Military transports leave every two days . - I 'll arrange a flight home . - Excellent . I 'm guessing ... You don 't need me to tell you what to do with these . I got a couple ideas . Ah , all this gear is clean . None of it can be traced back to this agency . If they find you ... You 're on your own . Is that it ? I guess it is . Thank you , Stan . This isn 't something I think I need to tell you , but ... There 's a very good chance you 're never coming back . I saw myself with my daughter . ( whoosh ) We were together in Afghanistan , And she was alive . God help anyone who stands in my way . Do you think I 'm chicken for running away ? Sometimes the best offense is a good defense . No , Janis , I 'm just scared . You played this out as best as you could . Everybody needs a successful exit strategy . This is yours . ( groans ) Hey , um ... ( chuckles ) I want you to know , um ... That night in somalia ... - Oh , Demetri , don 't . - No , I want to . I-I have to ... Stop . - Just stop . - No , uh ... This may be my last chance , all right ? I 'm pregnant . What ? ( engine starts ) ( taps roof ) Janis . Janis ! ( Zoey ) Oh , my gosh . This is perfect . My mom is gonna be so excited . Well , I 'm happy to let you use the space , But since you aren 't members here , And , uh , since we didn 't do any premarital counseling ... Oh , we don 't need any premarital counseling . - We 've been living together for a year . - I 'm going to pretend I didn 't hear that . Listen , you , uh , need to get married this afternoon ... Fine . But under these circumstances , You 're going to need to find somebody else to officiate for you . Hey , I never heard . Did you , uh , track down Aaron ? I guess he didn 't want to be found . Guys , you gotta see this . - It 's Frost . - You found him ? His phone was activated 12 days ago at a convenience store On the corner of Western and washington ... 3 : 18 P.M. 3 : 19 , a man fitting Frost 's description Walks to a 1971 citroen ds sedan ... Powder blue , silver top . A match from the shelter . - Mm-hmm . - Wait a minute . Dyson Frost made a videotape for you 19 years ago , Then encoded a phone number for you to find . And then after all that , instead of meeting with you , He 's murdering a homeless guy ? But he used my gun to do it . He may be crazy , but he isn 't random . There 's a method here . We just don 't understand what it is yet . ¶ islands in the stream ¶ ¶ that is what we are ¶ ¶ no one in between ¶ ¶ ah , ah ¶ Any word from the L.A.P.D. on the search for Frost 's vehicle ? - Still looking . - I 'll stay on top of it .

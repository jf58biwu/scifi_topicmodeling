 CLARKE : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water . ( YELLING ) None of us have . For three generations , the Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive . But now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind . One hundred prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested by the Earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of all , by each other . MAN : Previously on The 100 ... - Calm down ! - We 're dead to them ! And we 're alone ! You 're not alone ! You 're not alone . - Raven ! - Finn ! RAVEN : The council is voting whether to kill 300 people to save air . We have to tell them ! The radio 's gone . ( WOMAN CRYING ) Mom , please , let me get a doctor . No ! You can 't tell anyone . Tell me what happens if you do . Say it . You ... You get floated . I don 't understand . Why is it wrong to have more than one baby ? The Ark couldn 't survive . The chancellor can 't allow it . He 's , like , the Emperor Augustus , right ? Yes . That 's right . Just like the emperor we read about . The baby 's coming . Get the blanket . ( GROANING ) ( BABY CRIES ) Mom . My brave boy . You have a sister . You should name her . Augustus had a sister . Octavia . ( COOING ) Bellamy , you can 't let her cry . Here . Give her to me . No , Mom . Mom , you can 't fall asleep . I 'm so tired . Your sister . Your responsibility . ( OCTAVIA CRIES ) Mom ! Mom , what do I do ? Mom ! Shh . Please . Shh . ( SIGHS ) See ? I told you . It 's okay . I won 't let anything bad happen to you , Octavia . I promise . Octavia ! MAN : Hey . You 're up ? Yeah , knowing that hundreds of people might be dying on the Ark makes it pretty hard to sleep . Raven 's flares will work . Her radio would 've worked better . Have you seen Octavia ? No . It 's Octavia . She 's probably chasing butterflies . Clarke , I 've checked the camp . She 's not here . Okay . I 'll help you find her . Let 's check again . You go to the dropship . I 'll check the rest of the tents . Thank you . Don 't thank me . I 'm not doing this for you . I 'm doing it for Octavia . ( BREATHES SOFTLY ) ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( SCREAMS ) Please , please don 't hurt me . Please don 't ! No ! Aah ! No ! No ! Please ! No ! No ! BELLAMY : Hey , everybody , gather around and grab a weapon . My sister 's been out there alone for 12 hours . Arm up . We 're not coming back without her . Hey , Jasper , you don 't have to do this . You haven 't left camp since we brought you back . Clarke , I need to do this . We need all the people we can get . We need a tracker . Finn . Get out here . RAVEN : You want to lose an ear ? Can 't believe you let it get so long in lockup . This couldn 't wait till morning ? I was inspired . So . What did you want to talk about ? Nothing . It can wait . That wasn 't your " nothing " face . That was your " going on a spacewalk " face . No more spacewalks . Get some rest , okay ? BELLAMY : Finn , we 're leaving . FINN : All right . I 'm coming . Hey . - Hey , wait . - Nice hair . We should talk about this . You have a girlfriend , Finn . There 's really nothing left to say . Hey , hold on . It 's true . I care about Raven . But you and me , we started something . It 's nothing we can 't stop . Are you sure ? Because I 'm not . MAN : Guys , guys . Come here ! What is that ? MAN 2 : It 's so bright . Did you see that ? MAN 3 : Look up there . It 's so beautiful . They didn 't work . - They didn 't see the flares . - A meteor shower tells you that ? It 's not a meteor shower , it 's a funeral . Hundreds of bodies being returned to the Earth from the Ark . This is what it looks like from the other side . They didn 't get our message . - This is all because of you ! - I helped you find the radio . Yeah , after you jacked it from my pod and trashed it ! Yeah , he knows . Now he has to live with it . All I know is that my sister is out there and I 'm gonna find her . - You coming or what ? - Yeah . What are we waiting for ? - Move out ! - We have to talk to them . Three hundred won 't be enough . The oxygen level will just keep dropping . If we don 't tell them that they can survive down here , they 'll kill more people , they have to . Guys . They 're leaving . We gotta go . I gotta do this . And you should stay and fix the radio , okay ? Fix it ? The transmitter 's smashed . Unless there 's a parts depot down here , we 're not talking to the Ark . Art supply store . I know a place you might be able to get a transmitter . Great . It looks like you 're coming with me instead . Finn ? We 're not gonna find her without you . Be careful . Hey . I love you . I love you , too . It 's this way . ( FAINT CLATTER ) ( CLATTER ) ( GASPS ) Hello ? ( CLATTER ) ls anybody here ? He fixed it ? ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GROANS ) Look ! Over here ! MAN : Find something ? Guys , come on , over here . What is it ? Right there . You see it ? Is that Octavia 's ? Rope . - What are you doing ? - We need the rope to get back up . Flashlight . It 's hers . I 'm going all the way down . MAN : Serious ? Someone else was here . The prints are deeper going that way . He was carrying her . If they took her , she 's alive . Like when they took me . ( GRUNTS ) I don 't speak Grounder but I 'm pretty sure this means keep out . MAN : Let 's get out of here . It 's crazy . - I 'm outta here . - MAN 2 : Yeah , me , too . Go back if you want . My sister , my responsibility . I 'd walk into hell to find her . MAN : No , no way . I think we just did . Go ! I want another pony ride . You want another one ? Okay , you want to go through the jungle or the forest ? I want to see the Ark , Bell . Take me out the door . That 's enough . Both of you . ( ALARM BEEPS ) It 's time . But ... no . I don 't want to ! How do you even know ? Yeah , Mom , tell us how you 're never surprised by surprise inspections . Mind yourself , Bellamy Blake . Tell your sister what happens if they find her . She knows what happens . You 've told her a thousand times . Oh . You know the drill . I hate the drill . Sometimes I wish I was never even born . Stop it , Octavia . I know you 're afraid , but fear is a demon . Close your eyes and tell yourself that you are not afraid . That is how you slay the demon . ( BANGING ON DOOR ) - MAN : Inspection ! Open up ! - Say it . I 'm not afraid . Okay . ( BANGING CONTINUES ) No ! ( BANGING CONTINUES ) MAN : Open the door , now ! Miss Blake , by authority of the council , we 're here to perform a random inspection . Inspector Grus , it 's good to see you . Your uniform 's ready . There you go . Just like new . Do you have something for me ? Bellamy 's letter of recommendation . You think you 're guard material , kid ? Come here . Let 's have a look at you . I 'm good , thanks . - Bellamy . Stand up . Now . - I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . I don 't think so . You want to be in the guard or not ? Come here , three seconds . One ... two ... Bellamy ! - BLAKE : I 'm so sorry , Inspector . I ... - INSPECTOR : Don 't be . Maybe the guard will make a man out of him . - Clean that up . - Sir . Come to my quarters later . He 'll get that recommendation . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . I 'm not afraid . They 're so beautiful . Raven , I know you just got here yesterday , but we don 't have time for this . Come on . Hurry up and save the world . You 're just like your mom . I 'm nothing like my mom . Relax . That 's a compliment . Abby 's a badass . The pod was her idea . It broke her heart not being able to come down with me , but she never stopped believing you were alive . Yeah . Mother of the year . Well , my mom was AWOL most of my life . When she did show up , it was empty-handed . Pretty sure she had me just to trade in my rations for moonshine . How 'd you survive ? Boy next door . Finn . He shared his rations . Remembered my birthday . Saved my life . He 's my family . I got nothing . We lost the trail . Keep looking . ( GROANS ) Wandering around aimlessly isn 't the way to find your sister . - We should backtrack ... - I 'm not going back . Hey , where 's John ? I just saw him a second ago . Spread out . He couldn 't have gotten that far . They use the trees . - Shouldn 't have crossed the boundary . - Now can we go back ? There , right there . Another one . We should run . Let 's try this one . How did you find this place ? I didn 't . Finn found it . Hey , will this work ? Sweet . RF . Radio frequency . If we can just find the controller , we 'll be golden . All right . Finn made this . Oh , yeah . We saw this two-headed deer our first day on the ground . Welcome to paradise , right ? Got it . Finn always does that . Finds the beauty in the unexpected . Good to go ? Hurry up and save the world , right ? Yeah . We 're good . Okay . - Let 's go ! Let 's go ! - Let 's go , come on ! What are we gonna do ? They keep heading us off . Just keep running . - I can 't run much longer ! - I 'm not stopping for him ! - I 'm sick of running anyway . - Hey , what are you doing ? They know where she is . Diggs , where are you ? MAN : Roma ! Aah ! - Wait ! Roma . - Could be more . Stop . They were leading us here . It 's the only direction we could run in . Hey . Where 'd they go ? After Roma . ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) Aah ! Oh . You 'll never guess what 's about to happen . Inspection . I 'll get in the hole . No , no , no , no , no . Sit , sit . This is great . Please , Bell , I don 't want to hear about another amazing moonrise when I 'm never gonna be able to see one . You 're going to see one right now . The Unity Day masquerade dance starts in ten minutes . Now , I didn 't want to say anything until I was sure my cadet unit was working security . I 'm gonna be there watching you the entire time . This is real ? How do I look ? Mysterious . Bell , what about Mom ? Will you stop worrying ? We 'll be back before she even knows you 're gone . Want to go for a walk ? It 's okay . ( FOOTSTEPS , CHATTER ) ♪ ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ) ♪ Whoa . Who 's that ? Another girl who won 't notice us . My leg . I need to rest . Thank you . You saved my life . That girl back there , I knew her , so , if she 's here , then so is my brother . Please , you have to help him , too . They 'll kill him . You don 't understand me , do you ? Great . Why are you taking care of me ? You found me at the bottom of that ravine . Fixed my knee . What the hell are you doing ? Please don 't do this . Aah ! ( SOBBING ) Stop it ! No , stop it ! Stop ! Please ! Please don 't do this . There she is . Roma ! They 're playing with us . She only came because of me . They can kill us whenever they want . Then they should get it over with ! Come on ! We know you 're out there ! - You want to kill us ! - They 're coming ! ( DISTANT HORN BLOWS ) They 're leaving . ( HORN CONTINUES ) That horn . What does it mean ? Acid fog . We have to run . There 's no time . ♪ ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYS ) ♪ Nice eyes . What station are you from ? ( MUSIC STOPS ) WOMAN ( OVER PA ) : Solar flare alert . An x-class solar flare has begun on the starboard side of the Ark . All citizens must report to the nearest shelter zone immediately . This is not a test . This is a solar flare alert . Ready . - Bell , I need to get home ! - You will . Ladies and gentlemen , you know the drill . Masks off . ID chips out . Bell , what do we do ? Listen to me . Whatever happens , get back home and get under the floor . You 'll be safe there from the flare , like always . What are you gonna do ? Create a distraction . Go on . Bell , how do I get home ? Cadet Blake . Why is your weapon out ? Mask off . Sir , she 's ... she 's fine . I already scanned her . You don 't have a scanner . - ID , please . - Please , Lieutenant Shumway , I 'm begging you , she needs to leave . As a fellow guardsman , just let us walk out of here and I 'll do anything you want . Anything . You 're not a guardsman yet , cadet . ID , now . Stop her . How long are we supposed to wait ? Will this even work ? - We 'll find out . - No , we won 't . There 's no fog . Maybe it was a false alarm . They 're coming back . I think he 's alone . Now can we run ? He doesn 't see us . I 'm going after him . And What ? Kill him ? No . Catch him . Make him tell me where Octavia is , then kill him . How do we know he 's not leading us to another trap ? We don 't . How 's it coming ? Are you okay ? You hardly said a word the whole way back from the bunker . Heh . - Raven ... - Tell me I 'm wrong . Tell me Finn didn 't make this for you . Tell me you weren 't screwing my boyfriend as I was risking my ass to come down here . I can 't tell you that . He made one for me , too . Just in case you thought you were special . Do you think I wanted this ? I didn 't even know you existed . Look , as far as he knew , you were dead , Raven . Or you would have been soon enough . My mom , too , and everyone we ever knew on the Ark , and there was nothing we could do to stop it . He could 've waited more than ten days . Do you love him ? I hardly know him . ( GRUNTING ) - Bellamy ? - Octavia . Get the key . - Monroe , watch the entrance . - Okay . It 's okay . You 're okay . ( KNOCKING AT DOOR ) Cadet Blake . It 's Janitor Blake now , Lieutenant . Commander . A lot 's changed in the past year . May I ? You 've got some nerve coming in here after pushing the button - that floated my mother . - I was following orders . What the hell do you want from me ? You were a hell of a guardsman , Bellamy , you know that ? - Smart , hardworking , resourceful . - I wasn 't a guardsman . That 's what you said . I remember . You also said you 'd do anything to protect your sister . I remember , too . I hope that 's still true . Is she okay ? What I 'm about to tell you is classified . Chancellor Jaha has approved a mission to Earth . He 's sending the juvenile prisoners to the ground . One hundred of them . Your sister included . No , no . You can 't . It 's not safe . You have to stop them . I wish I could . What I can do is get you a seat on that dropship . You 're right . It 's doubtful those kids will survive , but if you 're there , at least Octavia won 't be alone . What do I have to do ? Kill the chancellor . How about I kill you instead ? Kill me and your sister goes alone to a radiation-soaked planet and you get floated like your mother . Ship launches in 20 minutes , Bellamy . If you 're gonna do this , we have to leave . Right now . - How did you find me ? - Followed him . We should go . Now . Before he wakes up . He 's not gonna wake up . - Bellamy , stop . - He didn 't hurt me . Let 's just go . They started this . Finn . Move . Foghorn . Stop ! That 's my brother ! MAN : Clarke ! Where 's Clarke ? - Get Clarke now . - Hey . I 'm here . What 's up ? Octavia . Finn . Finn ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . He 's alive . - Wouldn 't let me take the knife out . - No , that was a good call . Get him in the dropship now . Go ! Clarke , can you save him ? No . Not me . I need my mother . I need to talk to her . - There 's still no radio . - Raven , fix it ! Go ! Hey , you okay ? Okay . Yeah . Just go . Hey ! Why were you defending him ? Because he saved my life , that spear that hit Roma - was actually meant ... - No , you 're wrong . I saved your life . For all you know , he was keeping you alive to use you as bait - for one of their traps . - No . I don 't think so . You don 't think , O ! That 's the problem . They killed three of our people today . And if you would 've let me kill him when I had the chance , Finn wouldn 't be in there dying right now . Stop blaming me for your mistakes . What happened to Finn is not my fault . I wanted to leave , so if Finn dies in there , that 's on you . Everything that 's gone wrong is because of you . You got me locked up on the Ark . You wanted me to go to that stupid dance . You got Mom killed ! Me ? Mom was floated for having you . She 's dead because you 're alive . That was her choice . I didn 't have a choice . My life ended the day you were born . ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) Where do you think you 're going ? You can 't keep me locked up in here forever . Get inside . Go ! A storm 's coming . ( English US - SDH )

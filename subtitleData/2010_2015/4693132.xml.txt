 [ Evil Cortana ] I hate you . - [ Good Cortana ] Cortana ! - [ Evil ] Stop it . I 've made up my mind . [ Evil ] Maybe if I 'm going to die aboard this ship , then Chief will suffer the same fate as me . - [ Good ] Cortana stop ... - [ Evil ] You sacrificed everything ... - for him . - [ Good ] Control yourself . [ Evil ] I can 't . [ Good ] This isn 't right . Something is ... [ Good ] Something set us down . Something . Interesting . I need to think . [ Evil ] Thinking is what 's killing you . What happened ? You passed out during a training exercise . My chest feels like it 's on fire . Turns out the cryo blisters and your difficulty breathing are an allergic reaction to the psydoprethaline . It 's a drug we inject to keep ice crystals from forming in your cells during cryo sleep . Occurs in about 1 in every 50,000 or so . So I won 't be able to breath every time I wake up from cryo sleep ? The intensity of your allergy is still undetermined . I 'll know more in a few hours . I want you to take it real easy the rest of the day , cadet . Yes , sir . Thanks . Hey bro . I 'm on Andesia , it 's a jump away from home . It 's day , uh 496 . I 'm sorry I didn 't com yesterday . Couldn 't . We got pinned in a firefight for seven hours . Uhh , I must 've killed a dozen Innies though . Mom would be proud . We 're doing really good work here . We 're doing a good thing . Rich didn 't make it . You remember Rich from back home . He was right there next to me and then wasn 't . A pineapple and I 'm flying in four different directions . I had to shave it all off for Rich . He said it made me look tough . Anyways , uh I gotta go , bro . I can 't wait to get home . We 'll see ya . Cadmon , out . [ Lasky ] What are you doing ? Why do you torment yourself with these ? Are you okay ? - Whoa . - I 've been better . Wh , what did Dr. Hughes say ? That it 's nothing . Really ? You know we won today . Your strategy worked . That 's just me , being a leader . [ Sully over console ] Lasky , wake up . Oh , hey , Chyler . What 's up , Sully ? Get in here , you guys gotta see this . You look like crap . [ Sully ] Alright , so feast your eyes on grade " A " classified non-licit intelligence vids I pieced together . Super pain in the ass to do but ... so worth it . [ Dimah ] This is beyond top secret . [ Sully ] I 've never seen something encrypted so hard but I cracked it . [ Chen ] Wow . - [ Sully ] It 's crazy , huh ? - [ Chen ] Yeah . [ Sully ] Wait , wait , wait , wait now here comes the best part . - [ Sully ] Watch his hand . - [ Spartan ] Target acquired . [ On video ] They 're coming ! They 're coming ! [ Sully ] That thing is like two feet taller then we are . [ Dimah ] Pretty crazy , huh ? [ Sully ] Now check this out . [ Spartan ] We 've got an unknown hostile . Pulling back . - [ Vickers ] Uh , no way ! - [ Sully ] Now who do you think they 're running from ? Are they fighting together ? [ Sully ] Okay now , here comes the bast part . - Whoa . - What is that thing ? [ Sully ] Now what do you think that is ? [ PA ] It is now 1800 . All cadets report to the mess hall . [ Sully ] What do you think that thing was ? Definitely not an ODST . Then what could it be ? Maybe some upgraded ODST armour . Come on , did you not see the size of that thing ? That 's not ODST . Guys , look , you 're missing the point . What matters is that our soldiers were fighting alongside the Insurrectionists . Why would we protect the enemy ? Cadet Lasky . Colonel Mehaffey would like to see you . [ Mehaffey ] How are you feeling ? Uh , my chest burns , sir . Quite a bit . This is for you . Seems like you have a choice to make , Thomas . I don 't understand , sir . It appears Dr. Hughes ' test has revealed that the level of your allergy to psydoprethaline is serious enough to warrant a medical discharge . If you feel that you are unfit for service all you need to do is sign the release and bring it to the tether . When would I leave ? Tomorrow . Tomorrow ? You know , Thomas your memories and choices are all you 'll have left . At the end of the game the king and the pawn go into the same box . You have to decide what you 're willing to sacrifice . Axios . Axios . [ Colonel Lasky ] Thomas . It is with a heavy heart that I must inform you that today , your brother Cadmon was shot down by Insurrectionist forces on Andesia . All of his squad perished . I 've been told that it was a quick and painless death . There are no remains to bury . With this in mind I have decided that you shall not leave Corbulo to attend services . ( Voice fades ) [ Sully ] Lasky ! Lasky , move over I gotta show you something . Now 's not a good time , Sully , okay . No , it 's important . Now what the hell is that ? Hm ? Whoa . ( Powers down ) It 's off line . I 'm screwed , man . It 's ONI . They must have flagged those coms . I gotta talk to Dimah . Dimah ! Did you tell your mom ? Chyler ? [ Lasky ] Hey . I thought I 'd give your spot a try . That com didn 't make any sense . Hating the enemy is all I 've ever known . Did you tell Mehaffey about it ? No . No . What 's that ? Apparently I 'm allergic to war . What does this mean ? You 're leaving ? Yeah , tomorrow if I sign it . Are you going to ? I don 't know . - Chyler . - Oh , it 's okay . I know you don 't want to be here . I just thought that maybe ... I 'll miss you . ( Sirens start to sound ) What is that ? [ PA ] All cadets , report to the tether . I don 't know . To the tether ! Now ! This is not a drill ! Let 's go , let 's move , let 's move , come on ! - Let 's move it cadets ! - Go , go , move it cadets ! Go , go , go ! Go to your squads . Now . Keep moving , cadets ! Tyler , Lasky . The rest of the squad 's already at the tether . Let 's go . Hastati ! This way . Hurry up . Right here . Right here . Lasky , Chen , let 's go . Okay . Hold tight . Stay in line . What is this ? Insurrectionists ? I have no idea . When we 're assigned a number we 're going to get on to the tether , okay . What the ... ? Why are odsts dropping here ? I don 't know . Because we 're under attack . This is not good . odsts dropping is never good . This is ridiculous . I can get us on this wagon . No , no , no . We will hold our position . Guys , come on . No , Tchakova , that is a direct order . Suit yourself . - Dimah . - No , Dimah . Get back in line right now . Return to your squad , cadet . I 'm getting on this wagon . It 's full . Wait for the next one . My mother is Secretary of Fleet-Com . Your choice , marine . Go . Wagon full . Send her off . This is taking too long , April . Maybe we should bum-rush like Dimah . No . No , no , no , no , we 'll be fine . What the hell are those things ? Go ! [ Chyler ] Oh my God . What is that ? [ Chyler ] Tom , come on . - Come on . - What was that ? I don 't know . ( Screams and crashing of people falling from the tether ) ( Screams and crashing continues ) Come on , come on ! Run ! Subtitles by Tabularo

 Ladies and gentlemen , we are currently cruising through Shizuoka airspace . We hope you enjoy the remainder of your flight . What is that ? ! Tower , we just encountered an unidentified jet ! Please confirm ! We have confirmation here ... That 's private jet of Mr. Tony Stark from Stark Industries . The flight plan doesn 't show it arriving until later though ... Tony Stark ... That was Iron Man ? Iron Man Arrives in Japan Japan , huh ? This is where it begins . I have to say I was surprised . I had no idea that the head of Lab # 23 who I asked to build this station was so young , and beautiful . It 's an honor for me to be able to work with you , the Iron Man , as well . So what 's our schedule ? At 2 : 00 you have a meeting with the Minister of Defense , Kuroda . Well , I normally like to have a bit more flexiblity in my schedule ... How does dinner sound ? There 's a saying : " Time is money . " I see . You seem suited for something more challenging than just being a scientist . Maybe you should come and work for me . Welcome , Mr. Stark ! I appreciate the Minister of Defense coming to welcome me personally . So that 's Yokosuka , and that 's the American military base ? Yes . I have to apologize ... Normally , I would rather have taken you sightseeing in Kyoto ... Oh , it 's fine ! The view is lovely . It 's like Japan and America are working together , side by side . I 'm glad you feel that way . Well I 'm really glad we 'll be able to build an arc station in Japan . If this project succeds , it 'll be like the first step on the road to world peace . Certainly . Incidentally , is there any truth to the rumor that you 're going to be retiring from being Iron Man ? Yes , but there 's no need to worry . I 'm working on the production model of the Iron Man , " Dio . " Production model ? That 's fascinating . There are some talented young men training to take on the role as we speak . I have to imagine it 'd be hard to step down from being a superhero ... The old model of the Iron Man is actually stored at my estate . If you want to , you can come and see it sometime . Splendid . I 'd love to take a look at it . Now , let 's get down to business . I 'm sure you have some questions about the construction of the arc station ... Well , that was a very productive meeting . I appreciate your time . I 'm personally hoping that your project is a success , as well . That reminds me , I 'd like to ask you for a favor . What is it ? I 'd like to throw a little special event for the Japanese public . What do you mean ... ? Dr. Tanaka , how 's the final tuning for the reactor going ? It 's roughly 90 % complete ... Amazing . I had no idea you 'd be able to put it together this fast . Lab # 23 lives up to it 's reputation . The only problem is that we don 't have the plutonium necessary to start it up . That shouldn 't be a problem . I 'm not so sure ... I 'm woried about how the public will react to this . If this project is a success , Japan will have free energy . If you think about it rationally , how can that be seen as anything but positive ? Not all Japanese people are quite so rational . I think that if you want this project to succeed , you 'll need to understand the Japanese mindset . Well , tell me then , how do I get Japan to like me ? Well let 's see ... First , it helps to be humble . Humble ? Never heard of it before ... This isn 't gonna be easy ... And that 's why you 're feeling so nostalgic , boss ? Hey , Pepper . And , well , yeah . This thing and I go way back , so ... What can I help you with ? The prototype for Dio has been finished , so I 've sent it and the pilots over to Japan . Got it . So how are things going ? Pretty good ! The food 's tasty , and the women are beautiful . And more than anything else , in Japan , I don 't have to worry about the arc station tech being used for military purposes . It seems like you really like it there . There 's a reason I 'm starting this project in Japan . And if everything goes well , it 'll mean fulfilling one of my dreams . I hope they appreciate what you 're trying to do , Tony . Yeah . Dammit ! What the hell is this garbage ? ! It 's worthless ! And I 'm rejecting it ! Really ? Listen , if this is the only type of article you 're writing , you 've got no future . Maybe you should think about getting married instead ! Yes ! Please ! Not to you , dumbass ! That 's right ! Because Masuda-san writes great articles ! Whatever ... take a look at this . What ? ! Tony Stark is in Japan ? ! That 's right ! You 're gonna let the distinguished competition scoop you like this ? ! Now , Nanami ! You better write the follow up on this ! Yes sir ! So it 's finally ready ... Iron Man Dio . If everything goes well , we should be able to go into production back home . Excellent ! But I was actually looking forward to seeing you guys . It 's a pleasure to meet you . We 're honored to meet you too , sir . We 'll do our best . I 'm looking forward to it . Now , I know this is sudden , but I want to run some performance tests on Dio . Sounds good to me . Are you going to run it yourself ? Nope , this one 's all yours . No need for me to butt in . He seems easier to get along with than I figured ... Yeah , seems so . Well , he can leave it to us , and enjoy retirement ! Yeah ! Self Defense Force Mt . Fuji Training Grounds Direct hit ! What happened ? Target confirmed ... What ? ! It 's unharmed ! Incredible ! Not even a scratch ! This is just a taste of what Dio 's capable of . I 'd like to volunteer for the flight test ! I actually have a plan for that . How about it , minister Kuroda ? Regarding that event I was talking about ... I 'm sure the people of Japan would enjoy it . Leave it to me , I 'll give them something to talk about ! There it is ! It 's Tony Stark ! Mr. Stark ! What brings you to Japan ? There are rumors that the arc stations are actually weapons , do you have any comment ? Well , if it isn 't the Japanese media ! You finally caught up with me , and in a place like this ! Can we get a comment ? Okay then . The arc stations are revolutionary development that I hope to use to provide free , clean energy . Free ? Is that possible ? ! Yes . And there 's absolutely no industrial waste or emissions involved , so there 's no ecological concern . So you claim it 's not a weapon ? Of course . It 's true that I got my start in arms development ... But now , my company is working to develop the arc stations as the first step of our new global agenda . I can 't believe it ! Is he hiding something ? Would the government really let him do something like that ? Mr. Stark ! Regarding your operations as Iron Man ... Do you intend to fight crime as Iron Man while in Japan as well ? Unfortunately , no . And that 's because I intend on retiring from my role as the Iron Man . Retire ? Iron Man ? Seriously ? But there 's no need to worry . There will always be an Iron Man . Nanami-chan ! Nanami-chan , you need to ask him something too ! Okay ! Here I go ! I-I 'm so sorry ! Well hello there . They have some cute reporters around here . It 's a pleasure to meet you ... What do you think you 're doing , you pervert ? ! Nanami-chan ... Hello everybody ! It 's nice to meet you , the people of Japan . Now I 'd like to put on a little show for you all , in co-operation with the JSDF and American military . Now , I hope you enjoy this little dance we 're going to put on in Japan 's skies ! It 's the Iron Man ! There appears to be a new model Iron Man ! It 's Stark ! Tony Stark ! Tony ! It was Tony Stark ? Damn , so much for , " I won 't butt in . " He went and stole the spotlight ! That 's not even a little humble ... He fell ! What the hell was that light ? ! Excuse me ! Are you okay ? Aren 't you ... My face still hurts , y 'know . I 'm so sorry about that ! Mr. Stark , are you alright ? I 'm fine . But I 'm gonna get out of Dio . Make sure they recover it quickly . Understood . I 'm going to stop by my house , and then head to the station . Roger . Can I ask you for a favor ? Yes ? Can you drop me off at my house ? Huh ? Sure , that 'd be okay ! B-but in exchange , can I get an interview ? I 'm Outa Nanami , from the Tokyo Journal ! Hang in there , Nanami ! You 've got to pull this off ! You 've been keeping kind of quiet ... what about the interview ? Oh no ! Um ... I thought you retired ? That 's true ... but I wanted to leave on a high note . So he wanted to show off ? Did you say something ? N-no , nothing ! I actually have a question too ... How do the Japanese people see me ? To be honest , I think they don 't know what to think ... They 're worried there might be some secret agenda ... Oh , really ? But you 'll never meet anyone more up-front than I am . Do you mind if I ask what type of women you like ? Any kind of woman is good for me . I don 't discriminate . What kind of man do you like ? Um , well that 'd be ... Someone hard-working , and faithful , and confident ... And do you have a boyfriend like that ? No , unfortunately ... Unbelievable ! Japanese men must have no eye for quality . Oh totally ! You 've got that right ! Hey , wait ! I 'm the one conducting an interview ! Of course . Continue . I 'm honestly not sure what to ask you ... Well how about this ! I 'll show you a secret of mine that not many people know . A secret ? ! Like what ? Like how I kiss , perhaps ... ? Just joking ! Don 't want to get slapped again , after all . Wait , what about the interview ? ! I thought it might 've been a problem with the software but ... There 's nothing wrong . Then what was that light ? Mr. Stark , Dio has been recovered and the pilots are running tests on it . I see ... so there was nothing really wrong with it ... All ready . Roger that ! Looks like there 's nothing wrong with it . Maybe Stark just screwed up ? Hey , what 's wrong ? ! Calm down ! Just calm down ! What happened to him ? Hey , you okay in there ? Wha ? ! Don 't do it ! Stop ! Hey , what 's going on ? ! What happened ? ! Dr. Tanaka ! I don 't know ! Dio went out of control , and fired the repulsor rays at the other pilots ! What ? ! Dammit , they got him . What do you mean ? ! I 'm not really sure , but I think he 's been brainwashed . Brainwashed ? ! Yeah , and using Dio as the conduit ... There 's a chance that it 's been sabotaged since the beginning . That light from before ... that must be it . Mr. Stark ! Dio 's heading for the exit ! Dr. Tanaka , you need to seal off the facility , now ! Right ! I 'll try ! Seal off gates B-5 and B-6 ! It 's no good ! We can 't contain him ! Keep trying ! I 'll be there as soon as I can ! Seal off B-7 and B-8 ! All personnel , take Level-1 emergency procedures ! Looks like I just can 't quit you . There you are ! Not bad ... It takes an Iron Man to stop an Iron Man ! Maybe I overdid it a little . Hey , you okay in there ? Hey ! What the — Who the hell are you ? ! I am Scorpio . A mighty warrior of Zodiac . Zodiac ? ! Die ! This is only the beginning ! So much for retirement ... What the — Dio 's gone ? ! What just happened ? What 's going on ? Aw man , I had a chance for a personal interview and I couldn 't get anything out of him ! What do I do now ? The editor-in-chief is going to yell at me again ... Huh ? What 's this ? " Despite recieving governmental approval , there are still misgivings about permitting Tony Stark to bring nuclear materials into Japan ? ! " This might be a huge scoop !

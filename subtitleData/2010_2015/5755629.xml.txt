 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Adwin Kosan , Agent Lattimer , Agent Bering . You make the decisions ... Yes . " It breaks my heart to write this . " We both know the Warehouse is my happiest place . " Please forgive me , but I have to go . " Agent Steve Jinks . I 'm really looking forward to working with you . You 're lying . We need your help . You were almost killed by an artifact . You are now officially a Warehouse agent . Hey . Welcome back . Thanks . And the first guy goes , " I don 't have to outrun the bear . " I just have to outrun you . " Yeah , you told me that one on the eastbound flight . No , I didn 't . All right . Beginning our descent . What the hell ... Adam , you all right ? What 's this ? Adam ! How did I get here ? What 's happening to me ? I don 't know how to do this . Island Flight 687 entering a nose-down pitch attitude ! What am I doing here ? Approach is no longer stabilized ! Island Flight 687 , declaring an emergency ... Island Flight 687 , what is your situation ? The world is such a scary place . The most innocent objects can cause destruction and mayhem . A person sees enough of that , maybe they decide they don 't want that much responsibility anymore . A person might think walking away ... Okay , not a person . Me . I left . Life or death all the time , it was too much . But as a wise and also psychotic woman recently told me , you can 't walk away from your truth . So I 'm back . Am I ready ? The life or death thing , it never goes away . The world is a scary place . First day back . I guess we 'll see . Focus . Don 't get distracted by the high stakes . Concentrate on what is in front of you . And there 's no chair for me . Don 't freak out . It 's just a chair . It doesn 't mean that they 've moved on or they don 't need me , or ... Here you go , Myka . Oh , thanks . A chair , right . Myka ! Thank goddess . Leena and I were being outnumbered by Team Sausage Fest . Oh ... That 's disgusting . Claudia ... What ? You all eat crap for breakfast . It 's nice to finally have a healthy eater back in the group . Can we just try five minutes on , please ? Yes . Uh ... Adam Ashby , airline pilot who forgot how to fly his plane yesterday while several thousand feet over Seattle . Luckily , his first officer stepped in . Now , it could have been just a neurological event , but I don 't think it was a transitory scheme ... Whoa , whoa , whoa . Artie , are we gonna fly , or are we gonna drive ? Because this is uh-uh , unpleasant . Can you tell him ? He wants to know if we can go to Seattle by train , because planes are scary to him now . You still speak Pete ? Recovered , never cured . You 're gonna take a plane . You 're gonna be perfectly safe . You two go pack , and you two come with me . Hey , I was , uh ... Should we talk , you know , about me leaving ? Because if there 's something that you have to say to me , you can say it . No matter what it is , I can take it . Mykes , we 're double rainbow all the way . And ... We 're back on the case . You 're going to Boston . These are case folders . Thank you . Auction house offering today , as one of its items , a butcher knife owned by one Mary Mallon , who ... Typhoid Mary . Excellent . Kiss ass . You 're a child . The knife lets its owner transfer his disease or his injury to anyone . And your assignment . Go . Bid . Win . Go ! " Your " ? Not " our " ? No , I 'm gonna be in New Hampshire . Memorial service for a Regent . She was killed in a boating accident . Awesome ! I mean , not ... Not for her , obviously , very sad . But I get my own mission ? Yes . Take new guy . Uh-huh . And who 's the senior agent ? That 'd be me . Me-me-me-me , me , me . Me-me-me-me , me , me ... Uh , this doesn 't make any sense . Oh , it does when you know her better . No , last week it was all invisible snakes , phantom knives , slam , bang , death by Shakespeare . Today , you 're sending me on a FedEx run for a cooking implement . Isn 't there something more not boring ? I 'm gonna need you to keep that attitude in check , Jinksy , as the senior agent on this mission . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Please continue your " Me " dance . Artie . Come back with the artifact , and then tell me it 's too easy . We 've never seen a case quite like this . Two days ago , this man was an experienced pilot with a degree in aeronautical engineering . The chart says he 's gotten worse since he came in . Yeah . Yesterday , he thought he was in college , today he 's five years old . We think it 's some sort of accelerated Alzheimer 's . And no one else he 's come in contact with has been affected ? No , and physically , he 's fine . But his mind , his memory , it 's just ... He 's slipping away . All right , kids . This is where it gets interesting . Hemostat ? What 's going on ? Where ... What do I ... Where am I ? Oh , my God . Doctor ? Doctor , you need to clamp the bleeding now ! I don 't know what I 'm doing . The pressure 's dropping . He 's going into shock . Code blue ! Call for help ! Now ! And 300 to you , sir . Looking for four . Four , anywhere in the room ? Looking for 400 . Four hundred ? Looking for four . Four , I have ... Okay , Mary 's knife is next . This is very Thomas Crown . Oh , it 's not a Monet , it 's a kitchen utensil . So you 're kind of a poopy-pants , aren 't you ? No , it 's just that I thought that this job was gonna have a little more action . Like what I 'm used to at ATF . Guns and bad guys . Guns . Right . Well , we don 't go after bad guys in our job . We go after artifacts . So , you wanna kill a bad guy , maybe find the person who made this ceramic clown . Oh , just take it away , please . Next up is item number 62 , Mary Mallon 's knife . Ooh , ooh . Here we go . We 'll begin the bidding at $ 2,000 . Two-thousand , thank you very much . Two thousand I have . Looking for 2 , 100 . Thank you , 21 . Twenty-two , anyone ? She 's going after my knife ! Twenty-two to you . Do you not understand how an auction works ? Looking for 23 . Twenty-three to you . Thank you very much . Twenty-four hundred anywhere in the room ? Twenty-four . My budget isn 't unlimited , Nanny McSnootyson . I hate her . This is silly . Why didn 't we just buy it before it went to auction ? Because we 're stealth , dude . We try not to get noticed . And aren 't you the Buddhist or something ? Try being one with the universe for , like , a minute . I am Zen . I am way Zen . I can meditate for , like , two hours . Which , by the way , would be more exciting than this . Twenty-eight hundred . Looking for 29 . Anywhere in the room ? Twenty-nine hundred , may I say ? Twenty-eight hundred once , twice , fair warning . Sold to bidder number 14 for $ 2,800 ! Yes ! I mean , bravo . Yes . Hear-hear . We can go home now , Poopy-Pants . Ha ! You 've got a new nickname . I like Jinksy . Stolen ? What do you mean stolen ? It must 've happened before the auction this morning . In all my years of holding a gavel , this has never occurred . I 'm completely mortified . We 'll be back . He 's mortified ? My first real case , and the artifact gets stolen . First time on my own . No offense . Now , we have a bad guy . Yeah , great . And it 's our fault there 's somebody out there with the power to make anyone sick . We appreciate you giving us a call . When it happened again , I thought you guys would be interested . It 's Dr. Lisa Ward . She 's a surgeon here . Middle of a quad bypass and forgot how to perform the surgery . The Chief had to scrub in . Oh , my God , who are you guys ? Call my mom , okay ? I want to go home now ! Same symptoms as the pilot ? Not as far regressed , yet . Two victims , unrelated , they didn 't know each other . Different jobs , different neighborhoods , different everything . There has to be a connection . Well , maybe the artifact is airborne . Or in the water . Then why just these two ? I mean , why aren 't more people being affected ? Okay , I 'll follow the paper trail , see if their lives meet anywhere . Okay , I 'll talk to Leena and see what we can dig up about memory-Ioss artifacts . Okay . What ? What is it ? No , nothing . I ... Uh , nothing . I spaced out . Never mind . I 'll see you later . Hey , Mr. Mortified ? We spoke to the woman who bid against me . She didn 't steal it . Are you sure ? Maybe she was lying . She wasn 't . Yeah . So , we 're gonna need to see time-cards for any employees who had access to the collection room this morning . Certainly . But I can 't imagine it was any of my people . Hello . A janitor went home early . He was sick this morning . Owen Larsen . But he wasn 't sick , he quit . It says here that he 's only worked for you for a week ? Well , he 's an older gentleman . He said the work was too much for him . Really ? Coincidence , thy name is Larsen . I got the address . Let 's go . Nothing so far . Not with those particular memory-Ioss symptoms . It doesn 't mean it 's not out there . Well , we 'll take whatever you can find . So , how is it ? Being back ? I don 't know . Pete says everything is fine , so maybe I should just relax . Why do you ask ? Nothing . No reason . Leena , did you pick something up on Pete , aura-wise ? Myka , anything that I happen to see in Pete 's aura could just be ... You did . Okay , I 'm not imagining it . There is something bothering him . Leena , you have to tell me what it is . Tell you what ? Did she find something ? No . No , nothing . It 's just girl stuff . Gross . Yeah . What do you got ? No clue , meet clue . Check out the credit card statements for Pilot Man and Doctor Lady . They ate at the same restaurant . That 's right . Jalapeno Harry 's . Same night , April 6 , the night a waitress named Amy was murdered there . Feel free to applaud my brilliance . Well , maybe later . Well , I 'm gonna drop in and see what I can see . Okay . I 'm gonna talk to the victims , mention the name of the restaurant . Maybe it will jog something loose in their minds . Okay . Hey , Pete ? Yeah ? Uh , before ... You said everything was fine . And yet we 're still talking about it . I just think , even if it 's hard , you can say anything to me . Yeah ? Are you sure ? Absolutely . Anything ... Anything . Okay . Wow . That 's kind of hard . Uh , you know what ? Fine . I 'm just gonna come out and say it . Uh , " The Force will be with you always . " If you don 't want to ... Also , " Release the Kraken , " " This is Chinatown , Jake , " " So , stay classy , San Diego , " and " Pink is my signature color . " Never mind . Let 's not forget " I love the smell of napalm in the morning , " " I think we 're gonna need a bigger boat , " " Yo , Adrian , I did it , " and " Say goodnight to the bad guy . " Hello ? Hi ! Welcome home ! How 's about we get you started with an Onion Cone ? How many in your party ? Oh , no , thanks . But I have some questions about the night of April 6 . Um , I 'm here about these two people . They both ate dinner here that night . I was hoping you might remember them . Sorry , can 't help you . Hey , how 's about some Pretzel Fries ? Uh , no , no . I 'd better not . Um , anyone else around here might remember them ? No . Okay ? Look , if you 're not gonna eat , you 're gonna have to leave . Uh , Ken ? The thing is , I think you know more . Look , I 'm sorry . Okay , the cops keep coming in here . It scares the customers . Alright . Well , I 'm not a cop , so you can talk to me . Now , this thing says that the victim was one of your waitresses . Yeah , Amy . Great girl . It was awful . A couple of the customers from that night are being called as witnesses . Yeah . Those two . The cops have arrested this guy , Geoffrey Cedolia . They have him in custody . The trial starts next week . Well , whatever it is , we 'd better figure this out fast . Why ? What 's going on over there ? The pilot 's lost all his memories . There 's no one there anymore . Doctors think the involuntary systems will go next , swallowing , blinking . He 's forgetting how to breathe , Pete . If he 'd just left the knife in his apartment , we 'd be on our way back by now , mission accomplished . Don 't worry . Landlady said he 'd be right back . You know , the key is clearing your head of all distracting thought . Focus just on the target . I 've been on stakeouts before , Mahatma . Okay , I 'm sure you have . And you know , I have mission experience . Remember , I 'm the ... Senior agent . I remember . Has it been five minutes already ? Look , I am just now noticing that you seem super-focused on the whole senior agent thing . Maybe because I 'm the senior agent . Right . And since we both already really , really know that , maybe you should try to , you know , just relax . I mean , it 's just the two of us out here . Oh . I get it . You get what ? What are you getting ? What 's happening here ? Um , we 're out of town , alone , two reasonably attractive single people ... Oh . Oh , uh ... It 's okay . No , it 's not like I 'm not flattered . I am , and , hey , I felt it , too , that crackling chemistry between us . It 's just that I really need to focus on my career right now . I don 't have a ton of bandwidth for other stuff , as attractive as that other stuff may be , okay ? So , maybe in a year or two , if you haven 't gotten me out of your system ... Oh , my God . I 'm not hitting on you . I 'm gay . You 're ... How , now ? Gay . You know , when two people of the same sex find each other ... Uh , no . I know what gay means . I ... Look , I usually ... I don 't make a big deal about it . You didn 't . I thought I ... Oh , you know what ? I thought ... No , no , no . You know what , it 's my bad , it 's my fault . I should have stopped you . I was just waiting for you to take a breath . No , it 's cool . I 've actually been , um , waiting for an opportunity to feel this completely mortified with myself , so , huzzah ! I 'm sorry . Maybe we should just ... Not talk ? Good thought . Super . Nice , nice ... I really am innocent . I know that sounds like a cliché . You 're trying to find out who 's incapacitating our witnesses ? Yes . And Geoffrey , actually , I 'm not here about whether you did it or not . Why do you guys think your witnesses are getting sick ? Sick ? Do you honestly believe that ? Well , I 've seen them in ... Or is it possible , Agent Lattimer , that my witnesses were scared off by the prosecution , the government prosecution ? I wasn 't trying to imply ... And maybe you , also a government employee , might feel the need to protect your brethren ? Look , you 're a lawyer , I get it . But I 'm neutral , guys . I promise . And I 've seen your witnesses . They 're not well , and they 're not faking . And I 'm sorry about that . But you do realize Geoffrey 's life is at stake here , don 't you ? Shouldn 't you be protecting Eric ? Eric ? Eric Bell . My best friend . I drove him home that night , so he knows I left the restaurant . They 're gonna argue Geoffrey drove back to the restaurant to kill that woman . Tire tracks match his car . I went home and went to bed . My girlfriend was at home , but she 's pregnant , so I didn 't wanna wake her . Right , so she can 't confirm what time you got there . They 're trying the case in the press . Victim 's mother is on TV every other night , crying . This whole thing has been a nightmare . Honestly , I just want that young man to pay for what he did to my daughter . You 've been very vocal about Mr. Cedolia 's guilt . A person who didn 't trust that he would be found guilty might take matters into her own hands . Why don 't you come out and say it ? If you 've done anything to Mr. Cedolia 's witnesses , or if you 've done anything to tamper with his case before it goes to trial ... I haven 't . That would be vengeance , not justice . He 'll be found guilty . I know it . I have faith in the system . Hello , hello ! Hi , who 's this ? Agent Bering , this is Courtney Moore from KTRD News . We have an interview scheduled for now , right ? Yes . We were just finishing up . Courtney 's been very supportive . She 's given my daughter 's story lots of airtime . People need to know about this tragedy . Agent Bering , is it ? Yes . Still investigating ? Because we have the killer in custody . Geoffrey Cedolia did it . Alleged killer . My agency isn 't quite done yet . It 's typical government waste . My viewers already know the truth . How nice for your viewers . So if you 'll excuse us , we should get started . Yes . Thank you so much for your time . Thank you . Hmm . You know , I can 't help noticing ... Should I guess the rest ? That you put a lot of pressure on yourself . Yeah , silly me , huh ? Just trying to be good at my job . What a geekola . Yeah , but you are good at your job . You don 't have to try . Jeez . But I mean , I 'm not trained like you guys . I 'm not Secret Service or ATF , or NSA , or M-O-U-S-E . I 'm not a real agent . You 're real . You 're also lying . What ? No . No , I ... I have no training . No , not about the training , about caring about the training . Artie . You want to impress him . Yes , Angela Lansbury , you 've solved the mystery . Yeah , I want to make him proud . You don 't know how good to me he 's been . I can 't let him down . Well , do you think that he would send you out here if he wasn 't already proud of you ? You know , I never had a gay friend before , which is weird , if you think about it , because I 'm sort of fabulous , right ? I mean , I guess there was Paquito at the institution , but he was just one of Susan 's personalities , so I don 't think he really counts . And I just told you I was in an institution , so I guess today is Sharing Day . Eagle 's on the move . Bet you my self-esteem the knife 's in that messenger bag . Mr. Larsen ? Can we talk to you for a minute ? Who are you ? We know all about the knife , Owen , so just hand it over . All right . I knew it wouldn 't work . You got me . Here ! Hey ! Oh , my God . Are you alright ? I 'm okay . You just stop him . Stop him . All right . My knee ! Artie ? What ... He 's getting away ! What are you doing here ? My knee . I 'm trying to ... Chase him ! What are you doing here ? What ? Nothing . Nothing . Just , you know , I finished in Manchester early , I thought I 'd swing through Boston ... For the Red Sox . And ... Chowder . You were spying on me . No , no . Claudia ! Oh ! You really need to work on your timing . Mrs. Bell , we were hoping to talk to your son , Eric , about Geoffrey 's case . But then we heard you brought him here this morning , after he was affected . Geoffie ? Is Geoffie here ? No , honey . He can 't come play . Eric and Geoffrey have been friends since kindergarten . ERIC : I wanna play with Geoffie . My son . He 's been like this all day . What is wrong with him ? I 'm sorry , but we don 't know yet . He 's the third victim now . There was a reporter at Amy 's mother 's house . Her name was Courtney Moore . Has Eric had any kind of interaction with her , by chance ? Well , she 's been speaking with a lot of the witnesses . Why ? Courtney could be hitting every witness , one by one . Courtney ? Who 's that ? Well , she 's the reporter . I just told you . God , don 't you listen to anything that I ... Pete ? Pete , what 's happening ? Pete ? What ... Oh , man . You 're hot . Who are you ? Pete ? You don 't ... Hey . Hi . Are you comfortable ? Do you need anything ? No , I feel good . Oh . You 're pretty . Okay , that 's ... That 's gotta stop right now . Um , okay , Pete , listen to me . I 'm gonna fix this . Everything is gonna be all right , I promise . I want everybody to stop saying that . Because it 's not gonna be . It 's never gonna be all right again . Why would you say that ? I mean , why wouldn 't everything be all right , huh ? 'Cause my Dad died . And he 's not coming home . Right . I 'm so sorry . Pete , this must be hard for you . It 's hard on my mom . I don 't see her that much since he died . And she tries to stay busy , so she doesn 't miss him that much . I guess that must feel like maybe you 're losing her a little bit , too ? You still have your sister , though . Right ? Yeah . But she 's gonna go to college in a couple years . Everybody keeps leaving me . What the hell are you doing to people and why ? Agent Bering ? Hello to you , too . So we 're doing a little show here , and since you 're currently not making any sense , I 'm just gonna ignore you . My partner , Pete , is regressing like the others . Now , what are you using to make this happen ? Look , those people aren 't sick . They dropped out because they know Geoffrey 's a killer . I don 't know what game your partner 's playing , but ... I mean ... Who are we ? What is it ? I 'm sorry . Oh . What 's wrong ? Courtney ... Who am I ? Where are we ? Somebody help me ! Courtney , it 's okay . It 's okay . So , we just need to figure out where the guy would go . Claudia 's got a system here . It 's pretty clever , actually . Algorithms , plus cell-tower triangulation . Also , Facebook ... Do you have any idea ... Not even the tiniest clue . What ? You 're not perfect ? Should we talk about why you 're so upset ? I 'm not upset . I 'm just undoing the mess you 've made here , and redoing it correctly . Claudia . I did not come here to spy on you . Not the way you think , anyway . Oh , sure . The good kind of spying . Like , " Here , have some flowers and a puppy and some spying . " I came here to see you in action , dum-dum . It 's your first case as a non-apprentice . You know , I wanted to be here . He 's telling the truth . Sometimes that 's annoying . That 's funny , you 're not the first person to say ... Go . So you got to see me screw it up . You got a curve ball . We all get them . It 's not your fault . And look how you 're not giving up . That 's the girl I know . A woman , a girl . I 'm still proud of you . I actually told her that , too . Means more from Artie . Fair enough . I just found Larsen . And I think I know why he wanted the knife . Hey , where are you going ? We 're about to snag the artifact . I 'm going home . What ... Artie ? Artie . You 've got this . I trust you . Look , it 's not just your witnesses that are getting sick now . It 's my partner . And the reporter , Courtney Moore . How is she connected to all of this ? I wish I knew . Maybe Courtney picked it up by shoving her microphone into everybody 's face . She 's pretty aggressive . She only acts tough . Why do you say that ? 'Cause when my attorney stood up to her , she folded like laundry . Sawyer stood up to Courtney Moore ? Yeah . She tried that whole " ambush with a microphone " routine . I heard it went badly for her . Oh , my God . It 's already happening . You 're too late . You can take me away now . You 're too late . We 're not here to take you away . We just want the knife . He 's my son . It wasn 't fair . Now , it is . Cancer . Leukemia . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't just let him die . He has a little boy . So you started researching cures ? Anything . Even a crackpot theory on an urban myth website about Typhoid Mary 's knife . That 's why you took the job at the auction house . To get the knife . It sounded insane . A knife that could transfer illness ? But when it gave that fellow my busted knee , well ... But that means now you 're sick . Now it 's fair . My boy 's life is just starting out . He can watch his son grow up , protect him . Now it 's fair . You 're gonna arrest me for taking the knife ? No . We don 't go after bad guys . We go after artifacts . Dad ? What 's going on ? You cannot tell Courtney I showed you this . She was very specific about who was allowed to see it . Let me guess . No one ? Ever . And per her threat , I would like to keep my reproductive organs . I promise . Mr. Sawyer ? Sir , why are you defending a murderer ? I 'm not . I 'm defending a man accused of murder . In this country , there 's a difference . And what about Amy 's family ? I suppose you think the First Amendment only protects your client . Who protects his victims ? Okay , Powder Puff . Do you realize the First Amendment protects all of us , mostly you , because it deals with freedom of speech ? Yes ... But you don 't mean the First Amendment . You mean the Fifth Amendment , don 't you ? Yes ... Due process ? You know what due process is , right ? There 's gotta be something . Something out of place , or something ... How am I supposed to get a fair trial ... Old ? Then again , you have a dog in this fight , don 't you ? I don 't know what you mean . Aren 't you pitching your own show for national syndication ? The tough , vigilante advocate fighting ... Who wears a tie clip anymore ? If your first target is found not guilty , you won 't look very marketable , now will you ? You 're recording all this , right ? He was grilling her hard . Like she was on trial . I don 't usually feel sorry for her , but ... Everyone affected was questioned by Sawyer . Courtney , his witnesses during trial prep . Pete said he went after him , too . Always wearing that tie clip , I bet . Look , they 'll be bringing Geoffrey out any minute , and I need to see him alone . I would not damage my own case Of course not . Mr. Sawyer , look , I think someone found a way to use you . How long have you had that tie clip ? What , this ? A week , maybe . It was left as a gift , no note . This might sound silly , but I feel confident when I wear it . A week . That 's right when it started . When what started ? No , please don 't ask me any questions . I think that 's what causes this thing . May I ? " W.W. " Asking questions ... Walter Winchell . Good call . Look at this old photograph . Winchell was famous for pulling information out of people . Wait . Leena , can you show me his hands ? It 's the same as the tie clip . They 're a set . You think it 's a bifurcated artifact ? If the tie clip pulls memories out of people , then maybe the cufflinks put them back in . After all , Winchell didn 't leave a trail of brain-dead interviewees . I need to find those cufflinks . And I bet you know where they are . I did some digging . There was a young cub reporter who worked at the New York Daily Mirror in the 1930s , when Winchell was just starting there . A guy named Louis Thompson . Leena , how does that help me ? His granddaughter , Sarah Bell , and her son , Eric , live in Seattle . Where are they ? Where 's Eric ? Mrs. Bell checked her son out about an hour ago . A miraculous recovery . It 's weird . He 's fine now . Hey , hey , hey . Uh , are you leaving ? Yeah , I 've got to go stop a bad guy . Okay , I want to come with you . No , you can 't . It 's dangerous . But you 're leaving . I 'm coming back . Pete , I will come back . I promise . Just go . I don 't care . But ... Agent Bering . I 'd invite you in , but clearly , you 've already ... Where are the cufflinks ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . You 've already used them on your son , haven 't you ? I know that he has his memory back . I can 't help those other people . Of course you can 't . Because you don 't want Geoffrey being found innocent . You don 't want the police looking for the real killer , your son , Eric . No . You 're wrong ! He killed that waitress . Now , give me those cufflinks . Get out ... Or I drop the cufflinks . They 're destroyed forever , and your partner never gets better . As soon as we 're somewhere safe , I will send them to you , and you can save everyone What if you don 't ? Or what if the damage is permanent ? You 'll have to shoot me . Think of those innocent people . Think of what you 're doing to them . Mom ? What people is she talking about ? You said I was the only one . Eric , get in the car ! I never should have gone along with this . I made a mistake . I have to pay for that now . I 'm not gonna let them just put you away . It was an accident ! Please , Mom . No ! You ready ? Whoo ! Whoo , cool ! You 're a sweet kid . Well , Daddy calls me a " charming ' varmin . " Okay ... So ... Okay , Pete , can you look at me ? Okay . Now , I want you to look at these shiny cufflinks . Mykes ? Yeah . Yeah . The world is such a scary place . And Mr. Sawyer , you never gave up on your client , whom we now know is completely innocent . Where did you find the strength to keep going ? You gotta have faith in your principles , even when ignorant people try to stop you . Sometimes it seems like it 's nothing but anger ... And violence ... And hurt . It can be terrifying when you 're out there in it . But if you know where to look for it , the world also has warmth ... And love ... And forgiveness . I guess I should get out of this . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Just ... Just let me talk . There was something bothering you , even though you didn 't know what it was . We 're partners , Pete . And I should never have left the Warehouse without talking to you first . All this time I thought that you had something to say to me . But you don 't have to say anything . I do . And I think that we both need me to say it . I 'm sorry . Thanks . The world has joy in it when you find a place that allows you to experience that joy . When you find people that make you feel safe and loved , like you belong ... You don 't walk away from it . You fight for it . It 's easy to forget that , isn 't it ? I keep thinking about this kid , Eric . He 'd been dating Amy in secret for months . No one knew , not even his best friend . But when she broke it off with him , he was hurt . He took Geoffrey 's car to confront her and ... And it ended badly . Very . And when his mother found out , she ... She sent that tie clip to destroy Geoffrey 's case . She thought the memory loss was temporary , didn 't she ? It was still a terrible thing to do . But she was protecting her son . Like you thought you were protecting all of us when you left . No one is blaming you for that . But the stakes do get high . Do you feel equipped to handle that again ? I just nailed a one-inch light switch from 20 feet away . Yeah , I 'm okay . I just had to prove to myself that I could do it . There 's pressure in any job . I like this one . And what about your relationship with Agent Lattimer ? Are you able to move forward ? He 's an extraordinary partner . Please don 't tell him I said that . Good , then . We had to know that you could handle being back . We also needed you to know that you could handle it . We have no more questions . Your trial period is over . Welcome back . Hi , guys . Hi ! Welcome . Did you bring the ice cream ? Ice cream ? I thought we decided on donuts ... You all eat way too much sugar . Myka used to avoid sugar entirely . I don 't remember that . I can eat as much sugar as I want , I just never give it up .

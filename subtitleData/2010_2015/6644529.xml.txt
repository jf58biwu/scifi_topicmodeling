Only a privileged few knew the executed man was the heretic scientist Ochiai . Ochiai ? What is it ? Do you know something about him ? it 's nothing . the scientist Ochiai was conducting what were then outlawed experiments on Gauna Enas . One of the most horrifying experiments that is known was a human-and-monster experiment that had - I think that 's enough . I used the upper-level clearance information terminals to find out that one of this scientist Ochiai 's abandoned research facilities is at the base of this lake . What ? this conversation is going somewhere that I don 't like . is the key to the passage that leads to that research facility . she was following the gardes with the Kabizashis . So the Ena Hoshijiro can sense the Kabizashi . There 's no other explanation I can think of . I 'm classifying this as top-level confidential information . Be careful who you share it with . I understand . let 's turn back . there 's no way that we 'll only need that key to ... It opened ! What ? you know . It 's pitch black . What ? We 're going inside ? Wait for me . where are you ? Something bumped into me ! It bumped me again ! There 's something there ! calm down already ! { \ cHFFFFFF } It bumped me again ! There 's something there ! Nagate ! A ghost ! Talk about high-strung . Open up ! Why isn 't it opening ? Izana . what 's wrong ? I 'm fine . I just got hit by your elbow . What ? I 'm sorry ! I think it can only be opened from the other side . What ? It seems like the lights are broken as well . I 'm not getting a signal . We can 't call for help ! nothing we can do about that . Let 's look for another exit or an emergency phone . What is it ? Wait here for a second . Nagate . Tanikaze ! it 's not safe to go off on your own ! What do we do ? This is a problem . Hey ! Come over here ! wait ! Tanikaze ? don 't leave me by myself . Look at this . Whoa . How did you know it was here ? I could smell that there was a live switchboard nearby . What ? You smelled it ? we might make it back up to the surface . But is it really working ? Got it . It 's working ! Nagate . back when I was living with my grandfather . right . I forgot that you used to be an underdweller . What ? An underdweller ? It just stopped . Why did it stop ? Maybe I didn 't fix it all the way ? Where do you think this thing is taking us ? We will soon arrive at a zero-gravity area . Please check to see that your gravity shoes are in working order . What ? I don 't have my gravity shoes on today ! anyway ? Well ... this doesn 't seem like the abandoned laboratory . MSCF ? what is it ? It 's a secure containment facility . There 's no way we should have been able to get this close to this place . What ? Are you an upper-level council member ? Yuhata ! Izana ! I don 't get it . He 's still standing ! What are you ... Izana ... Yuhata ? They 're both sleeping . There 's no need to worry about them . I am Yure Shinatose . Izana is my grandchild . What ? Izana does not know what I am . Please don 't tell her . I have something here that I want to show you . I am going to turn on the lights . Please do not be alarmed . What is this ? A Gauna ? No . It 's not a Gauna . Captain ! This is an Ena / Human hybrid a certain scientist brought into the world . An Ena / Human hybrid ? 280 ) } Do Not Open 280 ) \ b1 } No Trespassing It was a humanoid weapon created by the scientist Ochiai in the midst of the Fourth Gauna War that was totally unlike the Gardes . It can destroy a Gauna core without a Kabizashi ? We 've had this for a hundred years ? there seemed to be some issue when it came to controlling them . Even Ochiai himself acknowledged the problem . However ... then that means that ... Yes . The truth behind the fourth Gauna Defense that has not been revealed to the public ... It isn 't only Ochiai 's auxiliary brain ... we must leave here soon . What exactly is behind those doors ? I do not know . Even members of the Kunato family are not allowed to enter there . This hybrid is already dead . drawing the Gauna to Sidonia . What ? we were able to successfully create a man-made Kabi . Man-made Kabi ? That 's right . We 've created the means to destroy the Gauna ourselves . Toha Heavy Industries is developing a new weapon that uses these man-made kabis . Tanikaze . Yes ? You will conduct a field test of the new weapon . How did we get back here again ? That 's so strange . I don 't remember anything at all . me neither ... 330 ) } Nagate the anti-military activists advance party colony ship has just left Sidonia . 506 ) } Live 000 anti-military activists ...

I 'm Probationary Subcommander Yuhata Midorikawa . would give us an explanation of the new weapon . I 've heard . So this must be the rumored Tanikaze . I 'm Shinsuke Tanba . You 're here . I 'm Sasaki . But aren 't you the Garde mechanic ? Yeah . I do that too . Good to work with you . Good to work with you too ! Wow . It 's amazing . It 's a Garde 's rear unit . It 's a prototype for the next-generation models . The aim is to make the Gardes more compact . And this is the new weapon you will be testing . Is this an ultrahigh-speed ballistic driver ? And how did you know that ? I used it in my virtual training console . What ? Wow . This is it ! This is the one I was using underground . I have no idea what you are talking about . That training device is still in a developmental stage . will you ? I 'm sorry . we 'll schedule the test for tomorrow ? Gauna . What are the enemy numbers and location ? One enemy . It 's on a trajectory for the advance party 's colony ship . Midorikawa ! Status update ! The Gauna 's distance from the colony ship is 80 km ! 000 km ! We 're too late to deploy a Garde squadron now . They won 't make it in time . Sasaki ! Can the rear unit be used right now ? we might be able to save the advance group ! We can 't ! It 's not ready yet ; it hasn 't been tested ! I 've used it in all my training I did underground ! enough with that ! hold on . The training device for the new weapon was actually constructed based on an old blueprint that oddly enough turned up . It 's entirely possible that Tanikaze is telling the truth . What 's that ? You mean it 's true ? My grandfather trained me since I was a kid . And I can even shoot without using the braking control ! Captain ! Please let me deploy ! then everyone on the colony ship will be killed ! Let me save them ! You have permission to deploy . We haven 't synchronized the rear unit with the ballistic driver quite yet . so it 's not up to us . Sidonia 's forward artillery lane gate now open ! deploying ! What is Tanikaze 's status ? I want all of the details displayed on the screen ! Affirmative ! he 's beginning to act like Hiroki . Will you turn against me one day as well ? so history won 't repeat itself . A Gauna-core-piercing round and an ultrahigh-speed ballistic driver ? A composite round combining an impactor mass and a man-made Kabi penetrator . and the man-made Kabi will penetrate the core . Are you serious ? The Kabi are fired as ammunition rounds ? So that means they are expendable ? I don 't think Tanikaze is going to make it in time . The Gauna has closed to 10 kilometers from the advance group . Tanikaze is 230 kilometers from the Gauna . He 's not gonna make it in time ! He fired ! The penetrator has missed the target ! Tanikaze . He 's firing from out of range . Tanikaze is decelerating . The recoil 's thrown him off course ! He shouldn 't even be able to pilot it .

 No . Just listen to ... Don 't touch me . Where are you going ? Hey ! Would you just listen to me for one second ? Hey , you all right ? Yes , I 'm fine . I 'm fine ! Let go of me ! Ow ! Hey . Hey ! Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Buzz . Buzz . It 's back . Not now , Gary . The humming from the microwave tower across the street . I can 't do my work . Gary , I called the cellular company and told them to shut it down , okay ? Yeah , they did shut it down . But then ... Then they turned it back on . Bill ! You need to shoot it . I 'm not shooting anything , okay ? Look , I 'll call them again . No , Bill , no more talking . It 's time for action . Give me the gun . I 'll shoot it . Gary , I 'm not giving you my gun . Yeah , give me ... No , you 're right . Give me a grenade . Gary , out . Bill ... Give me a grenade . Gary , goodbye . You don 't even have a grenade . Bye , Bill . Nina , I ... I need you to help me push someone . Sorry , Gary , I can 't do that . No , but Dr. Rosen says that we 're a team and we have to help each other . I am helping you , Gary . I 'm keeping you out of trouble . Look , I just want to spend more time with him . Well , maybe I can pick him up from school a few days a week . Huh ? Well then , drop him off . Oh , let me guess , uh , chamomile , right ? And , uh , lavender . What else ? A touch of angelica oils , some jasmine , and a little bit of sandalwood . Oh . Didn 't go so well ? I don 't know what you 're talking about . These are all aromas that help relieve stress so I 'm guessing your meeting with the young man that your parents chose didn 't go all that swimmingly . And I 'm guessing that Nina told you ? Yes , Nina told me . But I want to remind you , Rachel , of all the good work we 've been doing , you know , towards your assertiveness and confidence . So if you ever need to tell your parents no ... And I 'd like to remind you , Dr. Rosen , that we 've been working on my assertiveness , but I still have a long way to go . Mmm . You just interrupted me . I 'm so sorry . I didn 't mean to be rude ... Rachel , don 't be . It 's exactly what I 'm talking about . Progress . Busy morning . No , look , we don 't have to go through the courts . If you would just agree to ... Yeah , fine , we 'll stick to the schedule . Divorce is a tricky thing , isn 't it ? Especially when there 's a child involved . My therapy session isn 't until tomorrow , Doc . As someone who 's been through it , understand that it 's never a simple equation . But no matter what happens , Tyler will always be your son . You should write that up . Publish a self-help book . Hicks broke another one . That 's three . Well , it 's fascinating what happens when you let stress get to you . Yeah , my abilities don 't work so well . But you have made significant strides , Mr. Hicks , whether you realize it or not . And that 's something that you should ... Excuse me . Sorry . Rosen . Doc , we have a situation . Hope you got your metro card . Some of the witnesses , they say Officer Laurinzano started this mess , but I don 't see it . Bobby was on the job for 15 years . He was just marking time until his pension . Last thing he wanted was trouble . Wait a minute . Exactly who are you people ? Thanks for your help , Officer . You can go now . You didn 't push him too severely , did you ? I don 't like when they start asking questions back . You know you could have waited on me , right ? My badge still works . Where 's Gary ? Pending your disciplinary review . There 's no way in hell they 're going to let me go because of one bad day on the job , okay ? Besides , my badge still has its own magic . Anyway , Doc , I talked to the transit cops . They say all the riders are completely confused . Everyone apparently just lost it . One minute , everything 's copasetic , next thing they know , kicking , biting , screaming . Well , Wilson was right . This is right up our alley . Gary ? Gary , do you have anything ? No . It 's chatter . Chatter , chatter . Lieutenant Bixby wants his wife to pick up $ 50 of lottery tickets . My mom won 't let me ride the subway , though . She says it 's too ... Too stressful . It 's too much stimulation . I don 't believe this . Yeah , no , she says it 's crowded and it 's smelly and she 's right . Nobody 's talking about your momma , Gary . Hey , excuse me , he 's with me . Let him through , please . FBI . Let him through . Thank you . Hicks , you have got to be kidding me . What ? You leave a crime scene to go get a cup of coffee ? You know , I 'd brought you a donut , but they ran out . You think that 's funny ? This ain 't the damn movies . Let me tell you something , Hicks . Learn to follow instructions . You were a Marine , weren 't you ? Yeah . And now you know why I 'm a civilian . Well , Agent Wilson decided to show up . That 's your Department of Defense for you . Four unexplained riots in the past two months . One dead , 13 injured in Cleveland , 15 hurt in Pittsburgh , three fatalities in Philadelphia , now this . Well , that 's 29 people in the hospital and five in the morgue . NSA says this isn 't one of their usual suspects . Doesn 't look natural . So does this look like an Alpha or not ? Don , I only just got here myself . All I can tell you so far is that Alpha involvement is a possibility . Lee , you sold us on your group for exactly this sort of situation . If it is an Alpha causing these riots , you need to find him for us . Preferably before the local cops , CNN , or some damn blogger opens up a can of worms . Well , exposure is the last thing any of us want . Then deliver . Wilson , always a pleasure . You need anything ? We 're fine , Nina . Thank you . Don , one more thing while you 're here . Could you flash your credentials ? I 'd like to get a hold of the train 's surveillance footage . Harken 's FBI badge only goes so far , but the words " Homeland Security , " they work wonders these days . I 'll see what I can do . I forgot how much the subway smelled like human waste . Well , thank God for government limos . Thank you , Don . So I was able to get witness statements from the previous incidents . Same exact pattern . Anger , violence for no good reason , followed by sadness and confusion . When I push people they come out of it pretty confused . That 's because they 're not in control of their actions . And I don 't think that crowd was in control either . So what you 're saying is that it was an Alpha like Nina that pushed the crowd ? - Not exactly . Nina can 't push a whole crowd . Someone else is at play . It 's ready . Pheromones . That 's what 's causing these ants to be so aggressive . Normally the brain controls the release of pheromones , but our Alpha can supersede brain function and fire them off at will . And I think that 's exactly what Rachel detected in the subway . Yeah , and especially on the monkey . That 's where the scent was the strongest . It 's all about the monkey . The monkey was ground zero . Do not open this bag , Gary . That 's evidence . In the case of these ants , the scent triggered a defense mechanism when the hive was threatened by this scorpion . Well , whoever did this must feel threatened a lot . Four times in the past few months . We 've got to stop this . Why us ? Besides Harken here , none of us has any real training for this type of thing . I spent four years at Langley . Well , translating Farsi . But still , it 's ... No , I understand what you 're saying , Mr. Hicks . It would be a lot easier to leave this in the hands of traditional law enforcement . Only New York 's finest aren 't exactly trained to handle Alphas . Whereas the five of you have some very special gifts which make you as surprising and as unexpected as the person we 're looking for . If we can 't solve this , who can ? Hoorah . It 's ... It 's streaming . Wilson got the surveillance footage . It 's streaming . It 's humming . Again . What hum , Gary ? It 's a Gary thing . It 's not a Gary thing . There is a hum across the street . It 's unbearable . There 's no hum . There 's a hum . Fix it . We 'll look into it , Gary . I 've expressed myself . There ... There wasn 't a hum . That 's not funny . All right , so Rosen likes to make speeches , but it doesn 't mean what he has to say isn 't important . Listen , Rosen wants you on his team because he thinks he can help you and he probably can . He helped me . I know it 's hard to believe , and when I met Rosen , I was a mess . Plus , your hyperkinesis , that comes in handy . You 're saying me being on the team , it 's , uh , it 's win-win , huh ? Doesn 't matter what I think . It matters what you think . Bill ! Bill , please ! Hold on . The surveillance footage , I think I found something . Okay , I 'll call you right back . All right , it is right about here . What exactly am I looking at ? Right here . Look . The monkey . There 's our ground zero . The monkey had the strongest pheromone scent of anything in the subway car . So it had to have been right next to the Alpha when the riot started . By hanging off the girl 's backpack . Best guess , she 's our Alpha . We need to find that girl before she kills anybody else . So yeah , her name is Tracy Beaumont . She 's 17 years old . Rachel found surveillance footage of her entering the train on , uh , 47th Street . She was taken to Saint Boniface hospital . She was treated for cuts and bruises . Released , but then she skipped out before the cops could interview her . Well , we now have a name and a face . It 's a start . Right ? That is assuming she gave her real name . Well , that 's an astute observation , Mr. Hicks . Well , apparently I 'm an investigator now . Well , I 'll start here . Mmm-hmm . If Tracy is her real name , I should be able to dig something up . Gary , you gotta monitor the ATM and street cameras from here . No , I can 't , no . Okay , yeah , Gary . I can 't do that from here , Bill . It 's too much humming . Gary , that 's part of the job . Bill , you have to use your gun . No . There will be no guns being used on anything , Gary . Yeah . Gary , have you seen what time it is ? Yes . I have to be in bed at 9.30 . Yes . You 're killing me . I 'm sorry . He can look for Tracy at home just as well . Mr. Hicks , Nina , Rachel and I will ... You 're on standby . On standby . Fine . This is like a real job , you mean ? I 'm on call ? People are being killed , Mr. Hicks , and we have to find out how . If it 's any consolation , you now have an excellent health plan . His family is very well established , but you can 't appear desperate , despite your condition . Mom , I 'm better now . Dr. Rosen 's really helped . Lot more reason to meet a man while you 're healthy . You make it sound like I have some sort of a disease , like I 'm going to get sick again . I 'm fine , Mom . We worry . That 's what parents do . But I 'm fine , Mom . Besides , you don 't want to stay single your whole life . Yes , Gary ? Dr. Rosen , I found her . Tracy Beaumont , the girl with the monkey . She 's at 34th , walking north on 6th . That 's a very good street to walk on . It 's very well lit . Thank you , Gary . Excellent work . Just keep an eye on her , please . She 's turning onto Broadway , northwest . Broadway goes northwest . Yes , I know . Keep your phone on . Now , listen , we 've ... We 've identified a suspect and ... Yes , I 'll let you know as soon as we have her . No , yes , yes , it 's a ... It 's a her . Don , we 're on location now . I 'm going to have to get back to you . Gary said she should be around here somewhere . I can smell traces of the pheromone in the air . Can you track the source ? It 's the alley . What is it , Rachel ? What is it ? I lost it . What ? I lost it . I can 't . Focus . All right , Rachel , listen . Listen . You guys fan out , okay ? Up this way , if you see anything , you know what to do , right ? Bill . You 're only allowed ... Give me a call . Eyes only . Eyes only . Hicks , with me . Come on . Nina . Okay . Dr. Rosen , I am asleep . I know . It 's way past your bedtime . I 'm sorry , but , Gary , I need you to ping our location and then check the area . She 's somewhere near us . Oh , okay , okay . You have to ... You have to go through the parking lot . Yeah . And now turn right . You have to turn right . Heart right ? I mean left . Left . That 's right . Left . Thank you . Okay , which way now , Gary ? Uh , well , we 're at the corner of 52nd and 8th . Dr. Rosen , she 's there . She 's this way . She 's going into the youth hostel . Bill , four blocks north of the van . Okay , right there . Come on , let 's go ! Come on ! She went in there ? That 's not good . We have to get her out . I 'm not sure I can push them all . Don 't go anywhere near them . They 're covered in pheromones . That 's her ! That 's the girl ! Tracy ! Tracy , hold on ! I got her ! I got her ! Hey ! Hey ! Don 't run from me ! What are you doing ? Get back here ! I only want to talk ! Young man , do you know that girl ? He was in the subway , Dr. Rosen . You were in the subway ! No , no , no , no ! No ! No ! No ! Hicks ! Hicks ! Hicks ! Stop him ! What did I do ? I didn 't do anything wrong ! Why are you running ? Huh ? Why are you running ? Don 't ! Get off of me ! Relax . You were there in the subway . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I don 't know anything . Young man , your ... Your friend back there , Tracy Beaumont . Hmm ? She 's in a lot of trouble . And we 're trying to find her to help her before anyone else gets hurt . Doctor Rosen , he has the scent all over him . He must have been right next to her when it went off . You know about that ? The thing that my sister does that makes everyone angry ? Yes . Yes , we do . It doesn 't work on me . I 'm immune . Gary ? Tell me you know where she is . She got into a cab . Which one ? It ... Bill , it was yellow . She 's ... She 's your sister ? Yes . I 've been looking for her for months . I 'm the only one that can stop her . Because Dr. Rosen wanted me to come in , that 's why ... Yeah , well , we 're on call . It 's part of the job . No , that 's not what my mom said . She said we ... She used words that I can 't use . But ... And then she drove me here . The thing is , Gary , there 's a dangerous Alpha out there ... Yeah . And we have to deal with it . Yeah , I know , because we 're important , but I should be sleeping now and there 's still a hum , so I 'm upset and I 'm complaining . I just complained . You sure did . Well , he says she 's his sister . Yes , Don . No , Don , of course we 're checking . No , if you people come stomping in here , we might lose any chance of him cooperating . Just let me speak with him . I 'm sure I can convince him to lead us to her . Don ... He hung up . I 'll take that as consent . Do you want me to go in there with you ? I hope that won 't be necessary . You can take a seat if you like . No , I don 't want to sit on my ass . When can I get out of here ? Believe me , we don 't want to keep you any longer than we have to . But people are dying , son . And it 's essential that you help us find your sister . I don 't even know who you guys are . I haven 't seen a badge or anything . How do I even know you 're cops ? We 're not cops . We 're trained specialists in cases like , uh ... Like your sister 's . And I don 't think you want the cops to find her before we do . Okay , so , um , what are you ... What are you guys going to do to her ? Please , sit down . We 're going to do everything we can to keep your sister from hurting herself , or , uh , anyone else for that matter . Now , I 'm going to record our conversation . It 's only for the purposes of myself and my team . Okay , what do you want to know so that I can get out of here and find her ? We can start with your name . Matthew ... Matthew Hurley . Yeah , this is Special Agent Bill Harken . I need a background check . Hurley . But your sister 's last name is Beaumont . Beaumont is our mother 's maiden name . Or at least it , um ... It was . Uh , she 's ... She 's dead now . Our father beat her to death three years ago . And you are concerned that Tracy caused that ? Alice . It 's ... It 's Alice . She must have changed her name to ... You know , hide from everything that happened back home . Where is home ? Arden , Ohio . Harken , you hearing this ? Hey , Hicks , this is what I do for a living , okay ? Yeah , yeah , I 'm here . Yes , I will hold . It 's only a multiple murder case . Matthew , you ... You said your father caused your mother 's death , but when I asked you if you thought that Tracy had ... Alice had anything to do with it , you avoided the question . Do you think she had anything to do with it ? Look , Alice is a good person . It 's just sometimes it ... It all gets away from her . So it all got away from her on the subway ? It was that stupid cop . He shows up and then she panicked . You know , I just ... I don 't know . Sometimes she just gets really scared . And I am the only one that can keep her under control . Arden , Ohio . The town website is down . Okay , thanks , Gary . But just keep looking , okay ? Yeah . Rachel , this is what I do for a living . It 's what I do for a living . No . This stupid humming . Please . It 's the microwave tower across the street . Fix it . Please . So you 're saying that she 's some kind of a freak ? No . Absolutely not . I am not saying that . I 'm saying that she has a medical condition , which I can help her with . And you may be the key because , as you said , her ability , it does not affect you . Why doesn 't it affect me ? Because I believe your brain produces enough serotonin to counterbalance your sister 's influence , which is a result of your long time , Iow-Ievel exposure to her . So you ... You really think you can help her ? We can end this . But ... Only if we can find her , Matthew . This is a waste of time . Why doesn 't Rosen just have you go in there and push this kid ? My ability only lasts for a few minutes . Besides , Rosen doesn 't like to work that way . I mean , his heartbeat is regular , he sounds sincere . So speaks the human lie detector . Agent Wilson . Your security 's pathetic . Well ... Bill ! Agent Wilson 's here . Where 's Rosen ? How the hell did you get in here ? Oh , you 're good . I miss Agent Sullivan . She was nicer . I 'll be right back , Matthew . Don , hey . I asked you for more time . And I hung up on you , Lee , because it 's your job to keep me happy . We 're making progress . He 's beginning to trust me . My trust is what 's important here . Your entire operation hangs on my good nature . Now what you got for me ? Well , quite a lot actually . And if you 'd just let me finish what I 've started here , I think I can win his complete cooperation . What I need is his sister in Binghamton yesterday . Before she can add to her body count . What 's Binghamton ? Um , it 's a place where your sister can get some help . It doesn 't sound like that . It sounds like a prison . No . You 're going to lock her away . Matthew ... No one 's going to pin a medal to her chest for what she 's done . I found her . I 've ... I 've found her . I 've found your sister . Someone using the name Tracy Beaumont just bought a bus ticket to Chicago . She got an email confirmation . It leaves from downtown , Yonkers , at 6.00 a.m. It ... It ... It 's buzzing . Score one for Rain Man . Wait , that 's ... That 's a movie . I 'm not allowed to watch that . We won 't be needing you anymore . You have to take me with you . I can stop her if you take me with you . You 'll get hurt . What does that mean ? I 'm going to get hurt ? Don , just slow down . Can you please ... Look , I got this . I got this ! I can stop her . Doc ! Doc ! Explain . Like you knew this before ? Listen , I didn 't ... Mom , why are you still awake ? It 's not even light out . No , I 'm awake because of my job . That 's Matthew 's sister . What ? This is Matthew 's sister ? That is not the girl in the subway . Then he 's lying . Exactly . Let me go with you ! No , you 're not going ... I ... I found ... I found her . That 's what I do for a living . Gary . Gary . Yeah ? Don ? Look . Don , please would you ? No , you can 't do this . You can 't do this . You can 't ... Don 't touch him ! You can 't do this ! Don ! Oh , I hate it ! Rachel ! Rachel ! Stop ! Wait ! Stop ! Stop ! What 's happening ? I got angry . It 's all right , Gary . We all did . Where 's Matthew ? - I don 't know . I don 't know why I did it . I don 't know why . He 's dead . I don 't know . I don 't know , I don 't know . It 's amazing . You ready ? Almost . That Don Wilson was not an easy guy , but he did not deserve to die like that . Doc , do you have any idea why that kid 's ability didn 't work on me ? I mean , everybody else was going crazy and I felt fine . Exactly . Exactly what ? Why did they put the sheet on Agent Wilson ? It just ... It got all bloody . It was red . Ah , I can still smell the blood . I never knew what it felt like to be forced to do something against your will like that . And when I push people ... No , it 's not the same . All right . Dr. Rosen , I 'm sorry , I need to go home . Of course . I understand . Go . You got to get your nose looked after . It can wait . Nina , will you take Gary home , please ? You sure ? Yes . And Mr. Hicks , we need to find Matthew before Wilson 's people do . Bill can control his own fight or flight reflexes . I think I have a way to control yours . Serotonin . Sit down , please ? Yeah . Tracy . Why did you run ? Matthew , what ... Hi . What are you doing here ? Why are you here ? Well , we 're going to Chicago , right ? Let 's buy me a ticket . No , Matthew , no . That 's not a good idea , okay ? We can 't stay here . Shh . I know . We always said we 'd get out of Arden together . That 's before everything happened , okay ? You think I hurt those people for no reason ? It was because of you , for you , for us . Calm down , please . You 're the ... You 're the only one who doesn 't get crazy on me . We 're supposed to be together . I can 't . All the fights at school and ... And ... What happened to your sister . Tracy . And now these riots . That was not me . Matthew , people died . Okay ? You killed them . I haven 't killed anyone . Tracy , listen to me . Listen , I didn 't run away from Arden . I ran away from you . Tracy , come with me . Matthew ! Let her go . Let her go . Everybody , back up . FBI ! FBI ! Move ! Move ! FBI ! Out of the building now ! Just stay away ! Calm down ! I will start a riot . I won 't stop until a lot of people are dead . Listen to me . Don 't make it any worse than it already is . Get out of the building now ! - Matthew , please . Shh ! Just do as they say ! Please ! Hey , Matthew , listen to your friend . Don 't you see you 're making me do this ? No . Matthew , you control it , okay ? You make it happen . Don 't do it . I 'm doing this for you . No . I 'm doing this for us . - Mathew , don 't ... No , I don 't want you to do this . Matthew , stop ! Tracy ! Get him ! Harken , go ! I can get them ! Tracy ! Close your eyes . What ? How did we get up here ? Watch out . Watch out . Watch out . Matthew , you got nowhere to go . Give up before anyone else gets hurt . Leave me alone ! I can 't do that . I trust Matthew made it to Binghamton safely ? Yes , Dr. Rosen . Matthew Hurley is safely tucked away . So let me get this straight . Me and my tactical team have to drug ourselves every time we handle this kid ? Either that or use a hazmat suit . What was that , Clay ? Someone else 's problem . I 'm tactical . So back to these injections . Can we use a smaller needle ? That was like a horse-shot . My people didn 't complain . Yeah , well , sue me . I 'm human . And so are they . And so is Matthew Hurley , and you need to treat them as such . Do I tell you how to do your job ? How about this ? Don 't get your next handler killed . That was uncalled for . Don Wilson thought he could do his job with his eyes half shut . He botched the Red Flag roll-up and almost got you and yours killed . Twice . Don 't kid yourself , Doc . The situation ... Is getting worse . Sounds like the stress is getting to you . Would you like to schedule a session ? Only therapy I need is a week in Orlando with my wife and kids . You want to bury your head in the sand , be my guest . Me ? I 'm tired and my arm hurts , so we 're done here . Apparently so . Hey , Rach . Hey , Nina . Feeling any better ? You were pretty shaken up . I don 't know anymore . You know Agent Wilson creeped me out . Did you know that he smelled like stomach acid and Tums ? And now that he 's dead , I feel bad that I didn 't like the way the guy smelled . I 've been trying to forget it ever happened . How 's that working out ? Not so well . When I was upset , I told my mother to shut her mouth and that I hated her and that I was moving out . I 'm glad something good came out of it . Nina ... What are you going to do ? I 'm going to stay with my cousin . She said I could live on her couch for a little while . Comfortable . Look , I have a three-bedroom Ioft in SoHo . Free rent . You can stay with me . At least until you figure something out . I don 't want to impose . I think we both could use the company . Oh , there you are . Uh ... I 'd like everyone in my office . Okay . Here we go again . Well , I know what happened is ... It 's very disturbing to all of us , especially what happened to Don Wilson . But it 's understandable that he ... Yeah , people are there and then they 're not . And they bashed his brain in with a chair . Gary , please . No , people are there and then they 're not . Gary , stop . Gary , Don Wilson was a federal agent who died doing his job , okay ? You should have a little respect . Bill , just let it go . No , it 's ... It 's all right . Let what go ? He should learn to respect . Gary has his own way of expressing grief . Yeah , that 's just my way . People are there and then they 're not . As do we all have our own ways of dealing with a traumatic experience . Listen , I don 't just want to talk about Don Wilson . I want to talk about us . Is there still an us with Wilson gone ? Uh , yes , Nina , there is still going to be an us . They 're not going to disband our team . Agent Sullivan is probably going to replace Wilson . Now , Don Wilson died partially because he did not give us the trust that he should have . We stopped Matthew when no one else could . So , yes , we will go on and we 'll do more than that . We 'll thrive as a team . And we will , uh ... We will deal with what life and our handlers throw our way . Which means stopping more Alphas . The Ghost , Marcus , Matthew . You know , nobody can do what we can do . And it 's going to be messy . I 'm not saying we won 't make mistakes . I mean , none of us are trained for this kind of thing , Bill being the exception . But , you know , nobody can deal with the Alpha phenomenon like we can . So life on the cutting edge , huh ? Uh ... Yeah . Not for the faint of heart . Life ... Life is hard . There 's death and everybody dies and ... Gary ... It 's still humming . There 's still a hum . We 've caught Matthew , but no one has helped me with the humming . No one . Gary ? Yes . Come on . Come take a walk with me . Come on . It 's that one . It 's the ugly gray one . It 's the ugly gray one . Yeah . Okay . Here . Stand over here . Watch this . No , that 's the wrong way . Wait for it . No more buzz . That 's right . Come on . What do you say , we 'll go inside and we 'll , uh , we 'll worry about our future , huh ? I 'm not worried . Yeah , me either .

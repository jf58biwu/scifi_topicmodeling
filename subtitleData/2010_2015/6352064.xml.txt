It is important . I tell you , look . Yes , it is an asteroid . We have continued for weeks . It is the size of this desk . It will not survive the combustion in the atmosphere , like hundreds of millions . Yes , but this flash right here It is a temperature change . How do you explain that ? He is Santa 's sleigh . My God , is Santa 's sleigh . You found Santa 's sleigh ! Seriously , Neil . This is not normal . Nor is work on Christmas . Let 's go . I can not stay ? My parents are in Hong Kong , I go to my aunt 's house tomorrow , I hate my aunt . Just give me the keys and I 'll close . Alex , it 's Christmas . There will be no extra credit for staying . I 'm not asking you , I just wanted more time for this . I want to see the entrance . It 's okay . As you like . But be warned , it will become nothing . A lump of coal for Christmas . Okay , ugly Christmas to you . Amazing . Merry Christmas . What a fool . It 's okay . What the hell ? Yes ! That worked very well , right ? Hey , twins Boobies ! What the hell think you 're doing ? How many times I told them that the dynamite is for avalanche control ? It is not a toy . Airheads . He made me do it . So ... Really ? - Yes friend ... It is a celebration , right ? Look around , there 's nobody here , TJ and I amused ourselves a little . Really ? Enjoy ? With dynamite ? If you keep playing with that you 're going to rip your arm . And what will your mother then ? You probably blame as he always does . Exactly . If you want to lose an arm , do it in your weekend , not mine . - Sorry , Dad , were bored . - For real ? Yes ? ¿ You fixed the elevator as I indicated ? Yes , I did two hours ago . It 's okay . Mr. Ratchet , expected to go downtown , meet friends , go to the Christmas thing . Yes , I know . Excuse me if I do not want to hear talk Ben crooge what is fucking philanthropist . I do not know . Everyone seems to believe to expand the tourist center will attract more business . It will be good for the city . Son , everything has a cost . Ben does not seem to consider that . However , you work for him . Yes . It does not mean blindly support everything I do . This is not OK . Not this way . Hey , it 's Christmas celebration . I agree . - Sure , we could celebrate . - I could . You could , I could , - You could celebrate . - Okay , enough . Then you must go to your mother . Yes , Christmas touches me . I 'll tell you what , I 'll take you to the city . I need some supplies . A loving father . A good man . - The best . - Yes . Merry Christmas to all ! Merry Christmas to all ! Happy Holidays ! It seems that Santa vomited on the car of the mayor . What did you expect ? - Yeah . - Something like that . I see you later , Dad . This place is a circus again . I have no idea what she sees in you . Security is my winning personality . Definitely not your appearance . Very funny . Hey , better be careful with Mr. crooge . He loves their employees fall in love with your daughter , right ? In fact , I do not work for him , my dad does . I think it 's worse . Probably . Yes . See you later . Merry Christmas . Merry Christmas ! St nicolas . Charlie , Merry Christmas . You look very jovial . I thought you would not come to this . I ? I have a good excuse . Still signing my paychecks . What are you doing ? I celebrate the holidays . I see that . Fake snow is a nice touch . With global warming , we 'll be lucky if the city sees another white Christmas . How are you ? Pretend until all pass ? Do not worry about me . I 'll be fine . You can have my shop , but not with my spirit . Come on . Let 's do it fast . If I miss this , my dad will kill me . It 's okay . And if he saw that , he would kill them both . Your father is one thing . That brother of yours , I think we found . You are paranoid . Look , I do not hide , Marley . I know . I wish things were different . Good to see you . Scott , where is your sister ? We must begin . How would I know ? Is it my turn to put the tracking collar ? And if you call on the phone ? Should we do this now ? No . We do not have to , but we have to do this now . - Merry Christmas , Marley . - I did not bring you a gift . Okay , just open it . And remember , I wanted it to be bigger , obviously . OMG . It is a diamond . Only , pero ... I saved up to buy it , so I hope you like it . Tim , I love it . Good . They are trying to find . Insurance . It looks , is a shooting star ? You communicated with Marley , leave a message . Does not answer . Forget this . We 'll do without it . Thank you all for coming . We are here to start a new complex of shops . In doing so , we must also thank and say goodbye these shops around us . - Yes of course . - We honor the role they played in the history of our city . These are interesting times for our city . We have begun construction on ... What is that ? - OMG . - Come on , we must go . This marks a new beginning for Lennox , finally puts us in the twenty-first century . Prosperity is coming to Lennox . Be careful , everyone ! TJ . Neil , I am . He fell in Lennox , 130 km northeast of Olympia . I 'm going there now . If you 're bored singing Christmas songs , You know where to find me . Telephone Governor Michaels . It 's okay . ¿ Krystal ? Are you okay ? Guys , take your mom to the bowling alley . Are you okay ? Are you sure ? Well , there is an ambulance right here . It 's okay . Thousands ! Miles , get up . - What the hell was that ? - I have no idea . - Are you okay ? Can you stand up ? - Yes . All right . I need your help . There are many wounded , - We must get them out of here . - Yes . - You can do it ? - If I can . It 's okay . Are you on fire ? No , it 's freezing . Its alive ? I do not think so . What the hell ... ? Ben ! Help me ! My hands are stuck ! What the hell ... ? Ben ! Please help me ! Ben ! Please help ! ¡ Miles ! ¡ Miles ! Tell the governor that is bigger than we can handle . We need help . Wait ! Come on . - Mom ! Dad ! - Marley . - Marley . - Mom ! OMG . - I 'm sorry . - God , you 're okay . - Scott , did you see my dad ? - Yes . ¡ Scott ! Scott , what about you ? - Are you okay ? - He deserves more than that . Hear ! Enough ! What is happening ? And if you ask your daughter ? Enough . Friends , listen . I just talked with the governor 's office , right ? We have surrounded the area where the meteorite fell . Do not go near it . I want you to go home and stay there , and if they live in the center , stay with a friend or relative , right ? Thank you . Dad ! I was very worried . ¡ Tim ! Are you okay ? Yeah , well . What happened ? Let me see . What did you hit ? Scott Crooge . Want to know where he was Marley ? He hid with him . - It is true ? - Yes . We will talk later . Go home , everybody . Now ! You too go home . Call your mom , tell her what happened , and you 'll be late . I 'll see you at home . Be careful . It is getting worse . Why do not you go with them ? Take your child home . I am here to help . We do not need . The mayor called the cavalry will be here soon . No job for you right now . I 'm here to help the people of this city . Something you forgot long ago . You do not work for me . Really ? Really ? Do you think that matters right now ? State police arrived . You must warn them . They do not know what they 're getting into . What are you doing ? Charlie ? POLICE We learned that a meteorite hit . Not good ? There are dead people , so it is not . Do you have experience in these things ? What do you mean with " experience " ? There 's something there , I do not know what it is , but does not stop . We are the nearest division . It takes time to gather resources for a full squad . We can control it . I would not go there if you were . Get out of there ! What the hell is that ? Move ! Here in ! Hello ? Hello ? Do you think it 's over ? I do not even know what it is . Let me in . It 's me . Open the door . A little help could do . What the hell is it , Charlie ? The hell if I know , but it is more than just a meteor storm . Definitely . - Did you see that storm ? - All we saw . You have to get everyone out of here . Send to Tannen . He is right . None of us are equipped to deal with this . I 'll call Faye , that we receive in the community center . Tell him to get all the resources you need . I will pay the expenses . It 's okay . I need help here ! EMERGENCY Yes , we can move it to Monday and released on Tuesday . - Yes ? - Sorry . Faye , Charlie is on the line , he says it 's urgent . Did you understand that ? Discúlpenme . Are you okay ? Tim ¿ right ? - Did not you call ? - Do not . I tried calling , and I could not communicate . I 'm sure he 's fine . The mayor is evacuating the city . To all ? What is happening there ? A meteorite fell in the middle of Main Street , is complete chaos here . We need to evacuate . Can you give us place there ? Of course , I will make preparations . Well thanks . Ben said he would be responsible for the extra costs . - For real ? - Yes . When do I expect ? I 'll start sending people away . - That means you will not be with them . - Do not . I 'll stay here , to make sure no one left . - Charlie ... - Faye . Come on . Someone has to do it . You not always have to be you . Solo ... be careful , okay ? You know I will . - See you soon . - All right . Goodbye . I talked to Faye , prepare everything for us , okay ? I need you to take care of communications . Tell people using shelter , and bring food and blankets . I will be back soon . Than ? Wait . ¡ Charlie ! What are you doing ? It will take a while to get injured , and by the auxiliary generator is turned off . I 'll go home and get my tools . Have light and heat to get them pinned up . LENNOX MEDICAL CLINIC ¡ Tim ! What are you doing ? Did you call your mother ? I tried , but the lines are not working . Nor Internet or cable . We 're lucky to have electricity . We 're evacuating everyone to Tannen , to solve this . - You should go . - And you ? What do you pack ? Ben Gibbons and the mayor are in the clinic . There are many wounded and is failing energy . I 'll see if I can keep the generator running . Do you take . You must wrap up . It is very cold outside . TJ was he in the hospital ? I passed your house the way here , but he was not there . No . Was not . Look , we 're evacuating everyone . You need to leave here . Tim , now . I saw that thing down to us . The meteorite . It broke in two , changed color , it was crazy . What does that broke in two and changed color ? I did not see that . Where he fell elsewhere ? I do not know . He went to Mount Dickens . That is far from civilization . It is a good sign . Hey , Tim . You can talk about anything , you know , right ? Even if you think you do not approve . It 's okay . Does the dent in the rear of the car ? That was me . Very funny . You know , dad , Ben crooge can face a little . What do you think ? I did today , and I fired . Very funny . I 'm not kidding . Your mother is waiting for you , you must leave here . I will not be far behind you . Do not worry about me . For good luck . Merry Christmas , baby . Apresúrate . I did it for your own good . Fuck you , Scott , you 're not my dad . Enough ! Both . There will be time to discuss this , but now we 're going to solve this until Tannen . Take your bags . Marley , you will go with Scott . - Than ? - Why ? Because they are brother and sister and in one way or another they will be fine ! How about you ? I 've been to Parson , your car is in the garage . Move on ! What the hell was that ? Basta . We go now . - All right . - Come on , we must go . What the hell ? - Get in the car ! - Than ? Come on ! Move on ! Get in the car , now ! Hurry up ! Is that normal around here ? No . He went to the other side . OMG . Now that ? Do you like boats ? Unties the boat ! Come on ! Is arriving ! Come on ! I know ! Hurry up ! Let 's go ! - Come on ! - Hold on ! Come on ! How are we doing ? Hurry up ! It is the fullest ! I 'm going as fast as I can ! You have to go faster ! Does not stop ! I know ! Come on ! Come on ! - Faster ! - We 're running out of lake ! Faster ! Come on ! We beaching . We do not make it ! ¡ Agárrate ! Get ready to jump ! Come on ! Ahead ! Come on ! Ben , something happens to the west of the lake . Another meteorite ? I do not know . Stu Carson newly arrived , is almost frozen and quick-freezing screaming about . According to him , the road 10 is completely blocked , with large chunks of ice . I think the idea that this end is no longer possible . No matter if we take 10 people per car , we need to evacuate . The only roads are the roads . It 's okay . What happened back there ? It 's called rapid freezing , but only read descriptions , I never experienced in person . I have seen several in the past two hours . Let us go . Was there anything about this before falling meteorite ? Wait , no . How do you know the meteorite ? Who are you , exactly ? Soy Alex . Alex Novak . Study for my PhD in astrophysics . It was following this meteorite . Charlie Ratchet . Nice to meet you . You chose a strange way to spend Christmas . That would say . What happened back there ? You never saw anything like that before ? No . If it relates to the meteorite , - We get to ... - Wait . What , " is related to the meteorite " ? How ? It 's quite far from here . If I have reason is spreading . Namely ... So I need to see immediately the impact crater . I can take you to the clinic . I know the mayor was there . They can discuss what you want to do from there . Are you old-fashioned or modern ? Than ? I know a way to buy time . Yes . Right behind you ! Do not you taught to slide on the snow , Novak ? Just follow ! - Thank God you 're all right . - I 'm fine . Your lip . I fell . Is nothing . Something new ? No , just that it 's bad . Dad is still out there , obviously . I realize . Mom , have you ... ? Did not you see Marley crooge here , right ? Not yet . Hey , I need help . Let downloaded . Clear . Hello how are you ? This is great . Brilliant . Thank you . I 'll be right back , okay ? I grabbed him . Marley . Here you go . I wear this . SLOWLY What the hell is this ? Scott , ¡ relaxation ! What 's your problem , pal ? You block the way ! Really ? Scott , ¡ basta ! What is your problem ? My truck broke down . Can we help you ? It would be excellent . Back in the car , I 'll handle it . Sorry . What 's going on ? - What is the problem ? - I do not know . Charlie , where the hell have you been ? We do not have phone , We have some power , but the generator is ... Who is she ? I 'm Alex Novak , University . Does the governor sent you ? No , was the meteorite was part of my research project . The generator is overheating . Where are your tools ? - I had to throw . - Sorry . I find the meteorite . Where is ? In the center of Main Street , if it helps . It is the eye of the storm . What direction ? Suicide is out there again . I will go . Obviously , it is not a normal meteorite , and I need a sample . Thank you . If it were not for you ... I think you know . I 'll take this . Merry Christmas . Okay , guys , let 's go . Come on . We can not let you go out there alone . Really ? Beautiful . Keep on channel five . Wait a minute , Charlie . Almost done with the evacuation . When the last shuttle departs ... We 'll be out of here . That is the spirit of Christmas . We get the coolers , and make sure you have enough sandwiches . - It 's okay . - Thank you . ¿ Faye ? Krystal . What you do is great . Thank you very much for helping . What 's up ? I can not communicate with Marley or Scott . No one has seen . We have no cell signal . Jim saw people leave the clinic . Nor they are there . I am very concerned , Faye . Hey , everything 's fine . We will find them . They should already be here . This is crazy . I followed this meteorite for weeks . Never in a million years I believed that something like this could happen . More reason to get away . I do not ask you to come with me . That thing killed all who approached him . It will not kill you . Not yet . No service Call Failed I do not think it 's a good idea . I know , I ... I just need some reading . Is this area has a history of earthquakes ? No , they began on impact . As ice storms . Really we must move away from here . - Carefully . - Hello , Rob . Sorry , I just thought ... - What 's going on ? - I felt something . Have you seen Tim ? I do not know where he went . I saw him go out . ¿ Alex ? Alex , are you okay ? Yes . Your ? I think . Here , hold this . - Your leg . - Yes . Slowly . Look . Whatever it is , it is a great find . There is no precedent for something . I 'm not an astronomer , but I am sure that a meteor does not change the weather . Technically it is a meteorite fell to earth why , but you 're right . Where we are ? In the mine shaft beneath the city . It 's freezing down here . What was that ? I believe the meteorite is causing it . I also believe it . It is amazing . Scientists have argued for years if the water on Earth originated in the ice meteorites , but Earth has so much water that hypothesis could never avail himself with evidence . But this is serious evidence . Congratulations . We can climb out of here . I think if we go down that road , we take you back to the clinic . ¿ Alex ? Alex , you 're in the wrong way . Like my amazing son . Will I be kidding ? This is incredible , I need a sample . You are crazy ? What do you mean ? It 's happening . We must get out of here . ¡ Walking , come on ! Take cover ! Enter now ! OMG ! Did you feel that , buddy ? We must leave now ! It 's okay ? Now ! ¡ Cálmate ! ¡ Scott ! Run ! Marley . ¡ No ! ¡ No , Marley ! Run ! Wait ! ¿ Alex ? What happened ? I do not know . We 're still alive . Come on , let me help you to stand . Come on . Take this . I think these lanterns saved us . I mean , the ... As heat source . Look at the floor . It is a giant circle . It can not be that simple . Sometimes the correct answer is the most obvious . Still want that sample ? No . Let 's go . And another for hungry kids . Here you go . Did you find Tim ? He went . I think it went to look for Marley . - Heli-ski . - Than ? Give me your phone . Ben bought a heli-ski company last summer . ¿ Cole ? Krystal speaks . I need to drop everything right now . I have a crisis . God . Help ! Help ! ¡ Scott ! ¡ Scott ! OMG ! My ... ¡ No ! ¡ Scott ! Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you hear me ? Change . Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you hear me ? Change . Ben , can you hear me ? Change . The meteorite is altering all the microclimate in this area . Nothing like this has been documented before ? You never saw that ? ¿ Documented ? Do not . I find it hard to believe . There is evidence of all kinds of weird stuff that makes no sense . The scientific world is awake only a few thousand years ago . You know what that means for a planet 4.5 billion years ? It 's like a blink . That 's why I got into science . Best 'll get you out of town , or not come to graduation . If this continues , we will get next Christmas . What the hell was that ? It looks like an igloo . - Come with me . - Where we go ? We will do some Christmas shopping at the last minute . Cole talks Ratchet Faye , do you hear me ? Loud and clear , Faye . We are about five kilometers and seek stranded people . Five road is blocked , the step is covered . The only way out of Lennox is on foot . Do you see something moving ? ¿ Car ? People ? Not until now . Gary and I are not search and rescue , but we will do the best we can . Thank you . You do not know how much this means to us . Hey , do not worry . It would not be Christmas if there were no one to rescue , right ? Gary , dividámonos . I start with the limits and look south . You take everything north . Understood , Big C. In road . It is understood . ¡ Scott ! Scott . ¡ Scott ! ¡ No ! Do not ! OMG ! ¡ Scott ! ¡ Scott ! ¡ Scott ! ¿ Marley ? - Marley . - My God , Tim ! Everything is fine . Come on , we must move . Come on , we gotta go ! ¡ Scott ! ¡ No ! Are you sure about this ? Yes . Ben , Mayor Gibbons , do you hear me ? Change . Can anybody hear me ? Change . Curse . It 's too late . Ben . Ben , are you okay ? No , Ben , it 's not your fault . You understand ? Come on Get up . I panicked ... I ran over here and I hid myself . I do not know why I survived . I do not saved . I did not save anyone . What have I done ? Charlie , I closed the door . I hid in the boiler room . I 'm sorry . It 's okay . Ben , all right . You 'll be fine . Let me help you to stand . Slowly , come on . Let 's get out of here . This is incredible . It looks like the North Pole . It 's like an arctic desert . What do you mean ? Nothing remains . As far as I can see , only snow and ice . No buildings , no cars . There is nothing . Lennox ya no existe . Understood , Cole . Nor did I find anyone . I will go into town to do another search . Hello ! Here ! Wait ! They have to see us . Come on . Hello ! What the hell ? I see Dickens Peak , there is an area that has not been affected . No snow there . I 'll review it . - We 're down here ! - Wait ! Please wait ! - Please ! - High ! - High ! - Look , we move , we must continue . Help ! Come back ! Can anybody hear me ? Hello ? Genial . We must get out of here . We must go to Tannen . Maybe not . What are you thinking ? What choice do we have ? No good , just I try to find the least bad . I think there is a way to stop this . Than ? No , let us run . We go as far as possible . Can running where , Ben ? We have no idea how much it expands and at what speed . If there is a chance to stop it , is this . I 'm not entirely sure , but extreme heat is the reagent . That was clear . If we can produce enough heat ... In the point of impact ? We have an opportunity . An opportunity for what ? Do you kill ? It is re balancing nature . There is a sub-atomic chain reaction is not magic , it 's science . And we can stop it if we produce enough heat at the source . How about dynamite ? If there is enough , it can be . Yes , there are enough . I signed receipts , should know . - Let 's go to the resort . - Yes . Look . I covered the entire area around the city and I did not see anyone . It 's creepy . I will return to the clinic building . Let 's see if I can find someone there . You hear that ? Right over there . - Hello ! - Hello ! - Here ! - Hello ! Hears ! Survivors ! Three . Two men , one woman . I 'm landing now . Very nice of you to organize our transport . Beware when you go down . Listen , Marley , come here . Arise . You 're freezing . - We must continue . - Do not . - Marley , must follow . Come on . - It 's okay . - Come on . - It 's okay . He is coming back . Wait . I think I see something . Like two people near Avery Wood . I 'm going down to check . Who are they ? You can see them ? Still not wait . Here . Come on . Ratchet and Tim seem Marley ! Krystal , come quickly ! - They saw us ! - Thank God ! - Come on . - It 's okay . They found Tim and Marley . They definitely are ! Christmas came before ! I am landing . OMG ! ¡ No ! ¿ Gary ? OMG ! Care ! Gary ... my God . Later , Gary . Gary , do you hear me ? ¿ Gary ? Gary . Cole , what 's happening ? Faye , are you ? - Charlie ? - Yes , it 's me . Ben is also here . Something happened . Gary vio a Tim y a Marley cerca de Avery Wood , but then he screamed and ... It 's okay . We 're going over there . Faye , I need to listen to me , okay ? This thing expands and cold . Cold as an arctic storm . Enciérrense in there . Make campfires . Any heat source to survive a blackout . Do not go . We have a plan to stop this . We have ? Ben and I and Alex Novak , an astrophysicist . Faye , I 'm serious . Do not try to evacuate . Generate as much heat as possible there . It 's your only protection . I do understand . Charlie , guys ... Faye , I will find them . I swear . We can do it . Marley . ¡ Marley ! Are you okay ? My leg is stuck . I 'm so cold . The helicopter left . Tim , we 're finished ! Never leave here , we 'll die frozen ! Just put it . Arise . Look at me . Shake your feet , okay ? - To keep you warm . - Yes . Okay , he trusts me . Look at me . Look at me . Let 's do it , okay ? Out of here , okay ? We will do it . Think positively . - Be right back . - Where are you going ? I 'll make a fire . Radio answered quickly , I go out and do something before seal here . Here you go . Faye , vamos a Billings . - Than ? - I have a truck , we 'll be fine . You do not get it . The five-step road are closed . No exit . We risk . Do not do it . Charlie told us to stay in , was very firm . We took our decision . I know these roads like the back of my hand . We must get help . Rob , no ... Do not worry , we will return with help . You see something ? No . Cole , what happens ? The cold makes everything stick . Wait , right there ! All we need are chestnuts . I think I prefer a hot chocolate . With marshmallows . Do you hear something ? Maybe it 's just Santa on a test flight . - Everything freezes ! - Than ? OMG ! We fall , everything freezes ! May Day ! We are falling ! Hello ? My coordinates are North 45 ° 47 ' 12 " oeste 108 ° 32 ' 14 " . Get ready ! ¿ Tim ? Yes . Thank you . Come and get me . Of course . Te amo . I love you too . Marley , Tannen is right across that step . If we get there , I promise real hot chocolate . Really ? We can not miss Christmas morning , right ? Come on . ¿ Charlie ? Everyone is fine ? Cole . Cole . What happened to Cole ? Died . We need to get out of here . Come on . - Are you okay ? - Yes . Hello ? Ben ? ¿ Cole ? Hello ? Ben ? I see nothing . Come on . My God , look at that ! We must go forward . Dynamite is there . Gary said children are there . We must separate . I 'll destroy that thing . You lose your tests . I know . I 'll get the kids . You 're the expert in explosives . Try not to blow your yourself . It is funny . It 's what we always tell Tim . See you in Tannen . - Good luck . - You too . Come on . Good job guys . Help , let us in . - Open up ! - Open up ! - Here it comes ! A minute ! - It 's okay . Come on . Krystal ! Come now ! ¡ Krystal ! Careful where you walk . Slowly . Well , here we are . ¡ Faye ! ¡ Marley ! My God , I was so worried ! What happened ? He saved me . Tim saved me . Where is Scott ? Mom ... Where is ... ? Where ... ? I 'm sorry . No . Sorry . No . ¡ Scott ! ¡ Marley ! ¡ Tim ! He is hoping for a white Christmas . Careful what you wish for . Yes , really . DANGER EXPLOSIVE not approach What do you know of dynamite ? Bum . Come on . ¡ Marley ! ¡ Marley ! ¡ Scott ! Come on ! I 'm here ! You 're freezing . We 'll put you in front of the fire . It 's okay . Are you okay ? We 'll help you get warm . - That sounded close . - Yes . Come on . - Apologies guys . - Yes , sit here . - Thank you . - Sit here . We must go ! Not without my team ! Let 's go ! Leave it ! Goes up ! Come on ! Wait ! It 's right behind us ! Give me a stick of dynamite . Do you take . - You are crazy ? - Yes . Now , throw it ! Did you see that ? He did it back ! Wait ! Take another cartridge ! - Is working ! - Yes ! We 're doing ! Let us fly the meteorite ! ¡ No ! Dynamite ! What do we do ? We hurry ! It 's right behind us ! We do not make it ! What 's up ? I do not know ! Come on ! ¡ Agárrate ! It 's okay . This is a magical donkey . Will keep you safe . It 's okay ? This is incredible . I never saw anything like this before . Yesterday , this area was covered with snow and the city was green , and now is the reverse . Something crazy is happening . - Devils ! Charlie , look at that ! - Than ? Something is affecting the storm . - The meteorite . - What about him ? My son said it was split in two before falling . He said that a party headed here . Right . I saw this rare heat exchange when I saw the meteor in space . One party issued uncontrollable cold , the other hot issues . Together they make a normal meteorite , but if separated ... We are fried . We must re-unite . What are you doing ? I 'll find a missing piece . Look . We 're trapped . That is a strange crater . Advice if goblins flying reindeer , It would not be the strangest thing I 'd see today . - We should not ... ? - Should not what ? This is not an archaeological expedition , let 's take it and go . - Hot ? - Yes , a little hot . Heat resistant gloves . It is more than a little hot . How to transport it ? This will help . It is surprising . Look . Jingle bells , jingle bells Sound all the way What fun it is to drive In an open one-horse sleigh ! Jingle bells , jingle bells Sound all the way - Hey , are you okay ? - Yes , fine . It is huge ! All right . There is ! Be careful now . So I plan to do . Wait . No one will believe me . It is the scientific discovery of the century , and no one will believe me . If it 's any consolation , I think . Think you 've done so many good deeds today you never will be blacklisted from Santa . We should get out of here . Are you kidding ? I will not miss this . Merry Christmas . - Charlie ... - he got stuck ! ¡ Charlie ! Alex . Are you okay ? Are you okay ? We need to get out of here . How did this happen ? Marley . Dad ! Sr. Crooge . Did you see my dad out there ? We were together for a while . We parted ... Dad ! It 's Daddy ! Is the ! Dad ! - How are you ? Are you okay ? - I 'm fine . This is Alex , the scientist I talked to you . - This is my son , Tim , and this is Faye . - Hello . - Hello . - Hello . Nice to meet you . Ben . Good to see you . Also to you .

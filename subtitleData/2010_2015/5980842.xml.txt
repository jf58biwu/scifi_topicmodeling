 KIERA : Previously on Continuum ... Which one of you is my partner ... ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) My friend . There are two Alec Sadlers in this timeline . Go . And don 't get caught . I won 't forget this . Escher was Alec 's father . That I did not see coming . Welcome to your new home . If the enemy won 't meet us on the battlefield , then we must bring the battlefield to them . COMMANDER : Hostiles moving into your position . Bravo unit head to 12-9 for Evac . Over . ( GUNFIRE ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) We lost Bravo 3 . I repeat we 've lost Bravo 3 . ( GUNFIRE ) KIERA : Heavy rounds coming from the rooftop . Request air-strike . COMMANDER : Bravo 2 . Got him ! ( GUNFIRE ) ( GRUNTING ) Cameron , RPG incoming , get out now ! ( COMMANDER SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ) COMMANDER : They are bringing reinforcements . Cameron , where are you ? Moving toward Evac zone . Don 't . Please , don 't . Wounded hostile . Quadrant 12-9 . No , I 'm not the enemy . It 's our informant , sir . COMMANDER : Terminate and move out . He is our informant , sir . He has Liber8 intel that we need . COMMANDER : That intel has been acquired by other means . System override . Bravo unit copy , override . ( GUN COCKS ) No , no , no , no ! ( GUNSHOT ) COMMANDER : Suit system restored . Move on , soldier . Yes , sir . ( GUNFIRE CONTINUES ) Ripped By mstoll Birthday gift , from my daughter . Siamese fighting fish . Maybe she 's trying to tell you something . She 's a very straightforward girl . She doesn 't do metaphor . Maybe I should re-gift it to you . I 'm also a straightforward girl . You promised me help with my murder . What do you want ? In the other timeline , Curtis was against our arrangement . Maybe that sentiment carries over into this one . Curtis knows your value now . But he didn 't know it before my death . Tell me . These changes in the police department , the specialized divisions . Does it feel like a familiar path ? Feels like the future I come from started here . From our point of view that 's nothing but good news . It 's good to have your experience on our side . A back-up system to ensure we 're on the right path . That 's what we want . Stability . And that is a luxury I cannot enjoy with my killer walking around . I am working on your behalf , Kiera , believe me . I value you on my team . We can help each other . ( SIGHS ) I know it . ( TV PLAYING ) Hello . Come to Lucas . ( BEEP ) ( BEEPS ) ( BARKING ) Shh ! ( BEEPING ) MAN 1 : What 's going on , man ? MAN 2 : I don 't know . ( BEEP ) ( BEEP ) Hey ! Hey ! Stop ! ( BEEP ) ( BARKING ) Hey , stop right there , Lucas ! Don 't do it ! ( BEEP ) Open up ! ( BUZZING ) Easy way or hard way , Lucas ? ( DOG WHIMPERS ) ( DOG GROWLING ) ( GUARD SCREAMING ) ( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) ( BEEPS ) JASMINE : Nice work . Thanks . I missed the sushi ? We can hit some on the way . ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIGHS ) So the Department of Corrections finally sent us those pictures we asked for . Lucas has been cannibalizing parts from all over the prison . But this , is a newly-minted microcircuit . Prison hasn 't had an upgrade in 20 years . Somebody smuggled it in to him . ( SIGHS ) I got Betty doing a background check on anyone who 's had contact with Lucas . Check this out . KIERA : Lucas is messed up . ( SCOFFS ) Yeah , everything 's messed up around here apparently . I am the person you know . ( SCOFFS ) I am . Yeah , I 'll be sure to remember that . Down ! Everybody down ! ( WOMAN SCREAMS ) Don 't do that ! ( GUN FIRES ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Everyone ! Get down ! Get over here ! Move ! I want the manager . Everybody down ! I 'm the manager . Don 't hurt anyone , please ! I want in the vault ! Get down ! I said get down . ( WOMAN YELPS ) ( GUN FIRING ) I said , let me into the vault ! Okay , it 's this way . Please don 't hurt anybody . ( GUNFIRE ) Everyone , move over there ! ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) ROBBER : Let 's go ! Down ! Quiet ! Move over here where I can see you ! Line up ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) Don 't move . ( SPRAYING ) ( SOBBING ) He 's gonna kill us . Shut up ! ( SOBBING ) We 're all gonna die ! We 're all gonna die . We 're gonna die . It 's gonna be okay . It 's gonna be okay . ( SOBBING ) ( WOMEN SCREAM ) WOMAN : I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . Anyone else ? Anyone else ? Anyone else ? ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) Hello . I 'm Jacqueline . Hey . I was Mr. Escher 's chief counsel . Please , do have a seat . We have a lot to talk about . Mr. Escher , your father , wanted things done in a particular way , so ... ( SIGHS ) My father ? There 's a personal letter in your cahier . I believe it explains many of his choices . What ? But , this isn 't true . Mom ? JACQUELINE : The will is very clear . The document you hold in your hand will explain things more completely . Alec , your inheritance ... Mom ? Escher is Marc . The Marc that left us 15 years ago , but he is your father . ( SIGHS ) Alec 's inheritance is what ? A controlling interest in the company . And will anyone contest that ? Mom ! ANN : I 'm just looking out for you . That 's all I 'm doing . There will be hoops to jump through , of course . Particularly with the Board of Directors who will undoubtedly seek to put you in an advise-only position . ANN : And the plan is that you will navigate him through this ? JACQUELINE : That is what his father wanted . Let 's go ! ( GRUNTING ) What did you say ? What ? What ? Nothing ! You 're safe ! Go ! I can do it . Right now . No . Please . Please . Please . ( GASPING ) No ! ( ALL SCREAMING ) BART : Déjà vu all over again . CARLOS : You were at Transnational two days ago ? NOLL : Exact same playbook . Respectable looking thieves . Suicide vests . Vault entry . And then mayhem . Transnational thieves were felons , right ? White-collar variety . Fines , not time . ( CARLOS CHUCKLES ) Ain 't that always the way . Wow . Looks like this was one crime they couldn 't wiggle out of . But if you stop the crime before you get away with anything ... Somebody got away with something . Half of the Transnational safe-deposit box holders made insurance claims . CARLOS : It 's hard to prove what was stolen when the contents are unknown . It 's hard to prove anything was stolen if the thieves blew up . Yeah , I don 't get ii . They had this . They 're 10 feet from the door , loaded for bear , and then , suddenly lose their shit . DILLON : Ballistics matched the gun that was recovered at the Transnational robbery to a shipment of guns stolen by Liber8 . Liber8 always plays the long game . We 'll ID the robbers , see what the connection is from that end . In the meantime , you figure out what game Liber8 's playing . These robberies started after Lucas escaped . What does he bring to the party that nobody else does ? The crazy . I 'm in control of my emotions this way . I can see what you 're in control of . Look what I found . Can someone tell me why a legitimate business needs to hide some of its prettiest things ? INGRAM : And some of its dirtiest . Patents . MOUs . Environmental assessments . No corporation is going to file an insurance claim for losses like these . Dirty little secrets . And we 're in control of them now . ( SIGHS ) Those men weren 't collateral damage . And they weren 't innocent . You know , it 's not that . We done here ? SONYA : Not yet . What 's the next bank ? I need a list of all the clients whose boxes were rifled . Clients pay for their anonymity . And empty doesn 't mean stolen . All right . Fair enough . But only some of these boxes were opened . How would the thieves know which ones to target ? I don 't know . Lucky guess ? KIERA : Now , they didn 't care if they were seen in the lobby . But in here , they wanted to hide what they were doing . We 're gonna need that list . Sonmanto holds a number of safe deposit boxes and uses them primarily as back-up for pending patents , contracts , etc . Well , it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what 's been removed . I checked the records as soon as we heard about the robbery . That particular box was empty . As I mentioned , we have more than a few . You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense ? And you know that as a Fortune 500 company , we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement . But why go there ? Liber8 is behind this robbery , Mr. Richardson . You don 't want them having anything of yours . And they don 't . You went at him pretty hard . Yeah , well , I don 't need a future chip to know that he 's lying his ass off . We 've got half the companies filing for losses they can 't prove and the other half denying anything was stolen at all . Yeah . Well , that just means whatever they have , they weren 't supposed to have . You don 't sound surprised . Yeah , well , I had that knocked out of me . Carlos . I want to help you get through this . What can I do ? Well , you remember your dead body in the trunk ? How about you erase that ? Yeah , so it 's unusual . Thermite charges with an accelerant . Uh , the explosive load designed to implode towards the body . That 's why there were no casualties . Except for these three , of course . Pop Rocks ? You ever heard of anything like this ? ( POP ROCKS CRACKLING ) Ugh ! No , I haven 't . FIU retrieved wiring and components that suggest a radio transmitter . Let me see that . Radio transmitter . But , the bank cameras caught them pressing the trigger ? Hmm . If you say so , yeah . It 's just a weird set-up . You know , imploding . How close would someone have to be to trigger the detonation ? I 'm a blood and guts guy . That 's a little bit out of my depth . I 'm not sure . I 've got a guy that swims in these waters . May I ? Um , yeah , okay . Sure . Need it back . Is there anything else that 's not in the playbook ? ( CLAYTON INHALES ) Well , with an explosion there 's a little bit of everything , but I did notice these components had more cerebral spinal fluid than I expected . ALEC : So , this is soaked in brain juice ? Apparently . Is it the kind of thing that could be remotely triggered ? I don 't know . I can 't just look at a thing and automatically know what it means . But , from what you say , it could be like an on-board computer . A chip that receives signals . A primitive CMR . In a way . Some labs are working on brain-to-brain interface . They 've used it on insects , monkeys , rats . It 's like an actual mind meld . No ? Uh ... It 's like the Internet , but for brains . Well , Sonya 's got the surgical chops . Lucas can program pretty much anything . Did they have human drones in the future ? Not exactly . Cyborgs . Robots . Cool . Not cool . Liber8 infiltrated the systems and hatched the robots to use as weapons . They became a liability . In the end , all non-human workers were destroyed . ( SCOFFS ) Less cool . Did you know Escher was my father ? No . I figured . I just wondered if ... I never had a father . Not that I could remember . ( KEYBOARD CLACKING ) And when I met him , I didn 't like him much . I think he was reaching out to you . In his own way . Oh , yeah , he reached out . I inherited Piron . I know . I 'm Alec SadTech Sadler , and Piron exists as a separate entity in your future . Yeah . Well , maybe I 'll sell it . Maybe I 'll sell it right now . Alec . You don 't have to do anything today . This news has to be devastating , even if you don 't feel it yet . I don 't know what I 'm feeling . Escher was trying to run my life . Invading it . I mean , a normal person might think of a different way . " Hey , Alec , want to go out for coffee ? " Oh , by the way , ( IMITATES DARTH VADER ) I am your father . " ( SCOFFS ) Maybe he didn 't know how to tell you . Yeah . You say omission , I say lie . Well , maybe we can use this tech to patch your CMR problem . Hmm . ( INHALES ) Little incision here . Couple of wires there . And my phantom limb is back . Perfect . You think you can hurry up ? Look who 's talking . ( CHUCKLES ) Your golf bags ? Really ? We 'll have time before breakfast tomorrow . You can shag a few balls , can 't ya ? FRANK : Yeah ... ( SCREAMS ) ( TASER CRACKLING ) ( GROANING IN PAIN ) ( PANTING ) ( GASPING ) ( MOANING IN PAIN ) ( MONITOR BEEPING ) ( SCREAMING ) ( MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY ) Carlos , I went over it again last night , and the only thing that makes sense is that Liber8 is fishing for something specific in those safety deposit boxes . Do you have any idea what that could be ? ALEC OVER PHONE : A lot of these corporations are using high-security encrypted drives with long-life back-up battery systems . Now , these units emit very low electromagnetic radiation which can be picked up using the right gear . CARLOS : Well , that 's great . But , it means nothing unless we know which bank they 're going to hit next . ALEC : True enough . But if it was me , I 'd want to clear all my stuff before that happens . I 've been monitoring all the lower mainland branches and the Bregenzer Bank has a lot of high-end visitors today . The kind of visitors that usually have lackeys do their work ? VP . VP.VP. KIERA : Alec 's right . They 're clearing out their boxes in case there 's another robbery . If we can confront them about what they 're hiding , maybe we can figure out the Liber8 connection . All right , let 's go chat them up . I 'll meet you there . Alec . Don 't make any rash decisions , okay ? Sure . You 're investigating Escher 's murder , right ? Not me personally . All right . Well , if you hear anything , can you let me know ? Now that ... ( DOOR OPENS ) Of course . Thanks . Emily . It is really good to see you . Yeah . That was weird . Kiera was sentimental . Don 't . What ? Look , I know what you did . He sent you to spy on me ? Alec , if you can hear me for just a minute . Escher is not just some businessman . He 's my father . If you knew that , you 're worse than I thought . ( STAMMERS ) I didn 't know . Alec . Don 't . I 'm sorry . ( SIGHS ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) Carlos . So , did you find a mattress that you think is safer ? Strange that you 're coming after the victims of crime instead of the criminals . ALICIA : Mr. Richardson . My apologies for the delay , but we 're ready for you now . KIERA : You can keep your secrets . Just point us in the right direction . What do you think Liber8 's after ? Think of all the things you 'd rather keep to yourself , Miss Cameron . They 're special and significant to you for any number of reasons . Now multiply that by millions and you 're approaching the patents , agreements and research that my company would rather keep to itself . If Liber8 is after one particular thing , I honestly couldn 't tell you what that might be . That guy is ... ls good at his job . Not quite what I was going to say , but fair enough . I knew what you were going to say . ( SOBBING ) Emily . Alec . I can explain everything , but first I want to say , I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry . I know everything , Emily . And it 's okay . But I have something to tell you and it 's very important . And you know I love you and my whole situation with Kiera 's just complicated . Okay , I 'm doing this all wrong . Okay , do you remember our first date ? We talked about the Novikov self-consistency principle ? Time travel paradoxes . Well , he got it wrong . You know , the device , the ball that was in the lab ? And Escher had a power source ? Something horrible happened . I had to change things . Emily , I traveled through time for you . Okay , look , I know how that sounds . But , if you just listen to me . So this is how you 're punishing me ? No , Emily . I know , I did wrong , but all I want to do is make up for it . And this is your idea of fun ? Jerking me around ? Emily , listen , okay . I know you want to go to Thailand . I know you want to escape your problems . Things you did in the past . Things that I don 't care about , because I love you . I might be a lying bitch , but you 're an asshole ! ( PANTING ) You ... He loves you , too . But I 'm the one that knows everything . I 'm the one that risked everything to come back for you . Now , he doesn 't know , but I 'm leaving that decision up to you , okay ? You 're in control . Who was that ? Some lost guy . Look , I feel completely betrayed by you , okay . You 're spying on me , reporting to Escher . Telling me that you love me ? I know my father was a controlling jerk , so I can believe that he used you . Okay . But , I don 't know if I can trust you anymore . None of this feels right . Once I have a clearer head then maybe we should talk . Okay . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) You are hiding something . MAN : This is a robbery ! Come on , move ! ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) I said move ! Down ! Move this way ! Move it ! Move it ! Jesus . That 's Frank Ryan . He used to run our financial products division . The vault . Open or we blow it up ! Move ! Everyone on your knees ! On your knees ! Stay down . ROBBER 1 : Everyone on the floor ! ROBBER 2 : Get down ! Shut up ! ( SIGHS ) ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ) JACQUELINE : This is a welcome surprise . Yeah . Sorry to just drop in like this . I had to sort some things out in my head . Thought this might be a good place to clear away the other distractions . Have a seat . Really ? How 's it feel ? It 's a lot to take in . ( WHISPERS ) It just ... It doesn 't seem right . ( MUTTERING ) It 's not me . I suppose there 's some precedence in refusing an inheritance , Mr. Sadler . But , I 'm not the person to assist you with that . However , if you 'll permit me to show you something I believe your father would have wanted you to see , it may , as you say , help clear away the distractions . If you 'll follow me . This is ... You 're working on ... Genetics . And this lab will move to our Defense Technologies Division , obviously . ( EXHALES ) Your father always imagined you here , in the calm center of it all . You 're working with silicone transistors ? Mmm-hmm . That 's kind of old news . In the health field , yes . But we 're hoping to create something for the commercial market . Something that could combine with optogenetics . Self-activating neurotransmitters ? I 've read about early research . There 's so many uses . Life-changing implications . Or life-enhancing . Without the use of implants . You wear it ? We hope . ( CHUCKLES ) Don 't you move ! We have an advantage if they don 't know we 're cops . Agreed . What do you see ? Clayton said the vests were designed to implode . These have a lot of wires coming out of them . I don 't know if they 're the same . Stay down ! They 're being controlled . Wires run from the vests into the cerebral cortex . So if we pull the wires , it stops them ? Or it kills them . ( DOOR OPENS ) I have to get into that vault . How do you plan on doing that ? Guess . Oh , of course . Create a diversion ? ( SIGHS ) Did you see that ? What ? SONYA : One of the hostages , to the left . You mean , the guard ? No . ( WOMAN WHIMPERING ) ( CHAIR CREAKING ) Why is that chair moving ? Keep an eye on that group . SONYA : What happened to the video ? It 's some kind of , uh , interference . ( STUTTERING ) There 's a frequency coming through that 's just unusual . Unusual how ? Well , it 's a frequency that won 't be used for decades . Can you isolate it ? INGRAM : Um ... I 'll try something . Open that one . What is that ? Play that back . It 's not responding . Come on ! Play it back ! SONYA : Get it to respond . INGRAM : He 's offline . I want whatever was in that box . I 'm not going to hurt you . Hey ! Hey ! What happens if I unplug these wires ? What wires ? Great . There . The protector . Control the situation . I got this . ( GUNFIRE ) ( CROWD SCREAMING ) ( GUNFIRE ) Please . Stay here . Are you kidding ? I can 't move ! The cop . He 's right there . Get him . ( GROANS ) Forget the cop . Get the protector . Where 's Two ? Still rebooting . ( GUNFIRE ) ( PEOPLE SCREAMING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( GUNFIRE ) Blow number Three . WOMAN : No , please ! No ! ( CROWD SCREAMING ) Number Two is back online . All right , I 'll take care of it . Back off . I 've got this . Focus on the cop . I 'll take care of the protector . Liber8 's gonna kill them all . We can save them . They don 't have to die . Yeah ? How do we do that ? ( GUN CLICKING ) Got her . Ah , shit . We 've lost number Two . Blow number One . ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) I 'm standing . ( PANTING ) I have to unhook these wires . Don 't ! Please , I 'm walking . I haven 't done that in years . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) Where 's number One ? It 's offline . Please , don 't do it . They 'll kill you if I don 't . ( GASPS ) I 'm sorry . No , we 're not finished yet . Check on number Four . ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( SIREN WAILING ) What happened to him ? The future . You okay ? ( SIGHS ) Yeah . You ? Yeah . Except there 's nothing to stop Liber8 from doing this again . CARLOS : There 's something going on with those two . Was she in the vault with you ? I left her in there with Frank . She 's hacked . Yeah , and Noll was at all the robberies . Helping out . Yeah , some help . Up against the wall ! Hey . ALICIA : Get off me ! KIERA : We got another one . ALICIA : I didn 't do anything . KIERA : I doubt that . What are you doing ? ( ALICIA GASPING ) Get her a medic . Kiera ! Let 's go ! ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( SIREN WAILING ) ( ENGINE TURNS OFF ) ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ) ( GUN COCKS ) CARLOS : Noll ! Hold on , Carlos . Back up to the bar . Back up . ( GUN COCKS ) I 'm disappointed in you . You help a girl out , you don 't own her . Turn around . Any wires hooked in you ? Asshole . Making all your own decisions . ( GUN COCKS ) ( GRUNTS ) Pick up that shit . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTS ) Now we 're even . Oh ! JASMINE : Come on . Are you a cop ? Or are you a terrorist , huh ? Which one are you ? Which one are you ? Which one are you ? ( CARLOS GRUNTING ) Huh ? Come on . Answer me . KIERA : Carlos ! Stop ! Terrorist , huh ? Carlos ! Get off him ! Get off ! ( PANTING ) This isn 't you , Carlos . CURTIS : This is probably what Liber8 was after . Do you know what it is ? No . But , we 'll figure it out . I don 't recognize it from 2077 . It did a real number on my gear , and my CMR is still glitching . This technology could be from a different timeline . Different future . We 'll keep it safe . Who had it ? There hasn 't been an insurance claim for " mysterious object from unspecified future . " So , no idea . I knew I was right about you . Vickerdale . Gautuma . Sonmanto . Three horsemen of the apocalypse right there . We take them out now , we destroy the corporate congress of the future . And take a look at this from their secure drive . Oh , Sonmanto . You 're a naughty company . Whatever the play , it has to do double-duty . We lost ground with the human bombs . When did you get so squeamish ? When you turned men into things . Some men deserve it . Thank you . I thought you 'd still be in the hospital . I 'm supposed to go back . See a specialist . I still got wires in there and they don 't want to mess around . Me neither . ( SUITCASE OPENS ) How would you like to change the world ? How 's ! you get that ? We 're Sonmanto . We have friends everywhere . And between this little box and the wires left in you , Mr. Ryan , you can throw those away for good . Miracle cure , is that it ? You tell me . You were the one walking around six hours ago . ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Hey . Hi , it 's me . How you doing ? You should see the lab here . Anything I can think of I can find . You sound like someone who 's changing his mind about an inheritance . Piron 's got fingers in hundreds of pies , which should sound menacing , or at least greedy , but I don 't know , some of these projects ... There 's so much potential . So , your father wasn 't that bad after all . Maybe not . Maybe you 'll find a way to reconnect my CMR . I knew you missed us . Of course , I did . Let 's get things back to normal . Whatever normal is . Sorry , Kiera , I have to go . ( INAUDIBLE ) It 's better if he doesn 't know . Ripped By mstoll

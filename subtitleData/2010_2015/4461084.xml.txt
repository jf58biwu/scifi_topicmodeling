 - Hey . - Hey . How 's it looking there , bro ? Well , that depends . You want the good news or the bad news ? There 's good news ? No , actually that 's the bad news . - There 's no good news ? - There 's no good news . Why have you got to ask me that and get my hopes up ? Relax . It 's just a figure of speech . So how bad is bad ? Well , if my math is correct- - That is a big " if . " Like I said , if my math is right we 're about three grand in the hole . Holy cow . Three grand ? Three grand . I don 't know how we 're gonna buy the window casings or the gutters . What do you mean ? We don 't have another grant payment coming ? Not till we finish this room , which we can 't do without more money to buy more supplies . Just put it on the credit card . The credit card ? Ethan , the credit card has been maxed for weeks . I say we cut our losses , get out of this thing cold . You 're kidding me , right ? We 're halfway done . We can 't stop now , not to mention the fact that Mom and Dad devoted their lives to this inn . Get your head out of your ass . I thought that 's why we were doing this . Eh ... Holy cow . It 's not that bad . It 's not the end of the world . I 'm talking about that . There 's something falling from the sky . Wow . Whoa . What ? Whoa . I 'd better call the sheriff . What ? There . Cool . Oh . This is awesome . It 's like a spaceship or something . It 's not a spaceship . Look at those weird symbols on the wreckage . It 's Russian . An old Russian spaceship . It 's not a spaceship , you big dork . Well , what is it ? I don 't know . Probably a satellite . How do you know ? I saw this thing on TV once . There 's hundreds of them up there floating around . Sometimes they stop working and they crash to earth . You think Gregoropoulos knows ? No , looks like he slept right through it . Figures . What do you reckon we do with it ? I don 't know . I guess we should call the space agency or the feds or something . Why ? So we can get full-body cavity searches ? Okay , well , what do you want to do with it ? Sell it . Satellites are worth a lot of money . It 's junk , Ethan . Who 's gonna want to buy junk ? Earl . I 've got a tarp in the back we can wrap it all up in . What the heck is that ? Beats me . Maybe it 's one of those giant gorilla things you put on carwash roofs . Would you take your car to a place that had that on the roof ? I guess not . - What 's up , guys ? - Good morning , Max . Hey . Can I get you some coffee or something ? Yeah , coffee would be great . Thanks , man . Damn , Earl . What the heck are you making ? Oh , that there , Ethan , is what you call an iron golem . An iron what ? The golem . It 's from Jewish folklore . Certain rabbis used to create these giant servants to protect the townsfolk . You mean , like a scarecrow ? I 'm building that for the town centennial . It 's gonna be a surprise . Oh , yeah , it 's definitely gonna be that . Beautiful , ain 't it ? Oh , it 's definitely unique . Yeah . Yep , definitely unique . So what brings you boys out yonder ? Uh , got something I want to show you . Wow , what you got here ? A satellite- - crash-landed on Gregoropoulos' place this morning . It 's Russian . - You don 't say . - Uh-huh . Well , Gregoropoulos- - he don 't want it ? Finders keepers . I 'll give you $ 200 . I was thinking more along the lines of $ 2,000 . What , are you nuts ? It 's just a pile of scrap metal . The heck it is . That 's genuine space debris , Earl . Yeah , and there is gold and silver in some of that metal , too , and you know it . Well , all right , I 'll give you $ 500 . $ 1 , 500 . Well ... I 'll tell you what : it 's only because I like you boys and that 's the only reason . I 'll- - I 'll go to $ 800 . - A thou- - - $ 800 sounds pretty good . Oh , don 't look at me like that . 800 bucks is a good deal . I mean it 's Russian space junk , not even made in America . I could have got him up to $ 1 , 000 if you hadn 't jumped in . That would have covered all the gutters . Yeah , but whose idea was it to sell it ? Spare me , Einstein . Holy cow . So he said . I didn 't know she was back . Neither did I . You should try it . Are you okay , bro ? You look like you just saw a ghost . Aren 't you gonna go say hi ? - What for ? - What for ? Are you kidding me ? The love of your life just walked by . That was a long time ago , Ethan . Exactly . So why are you still holding a grudge ? Go get the gutters , okay ? ♪ I got some new shoes on , baby ♪ ♪ I 'm gonna walk away my blues ♪ ♪ Hmm , yeah ♪ ♪ I got some new shoes on , pretty baby ♪ ♪ I 'm gonna walk away my blues , yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah , don 't get so excited , baby ... ♪ Max , I need a refill .

A few days ago . Staying at my aunt 's . I 've been meaning to call you . Okay , sure . Come on . Of course I was going to call you . I 'm just getting settled in and having a bit of culture shock coming back to Redeemer . I can imagine . So who is this lovely young lady ? This is my daughter Claire . - Hi , Claire . I 'm Jake . - Hi . Hi . I 'm an old friend of your mom 's . What do you think of our little town ? It 's okay , I guess . Takes a bit of getting used to . I bet it does . It must be a pretty big change for you , huh ? Yeah . It 's the smallest town I 've ever seen . Well , yeah , it might be , but it 's also what makes it so special . I 'm gonna go wait in the car , Mom . Nice to meet you . Nice to meet you , too , Claire . She seems like a great kid . She is . And things are good for you ? You 're still working as a biology teacher , right ? Uh , I 'm getting a divorce . Wow . Uh ... I 'm sorry to hear that . Gee , you guys seemed like the perfect couple . Well , we were at one time . It must be pretty hard for Claire , I guess , huh ? She 's- - she 's hanging in there . Mom , let 's go . Are you guys moving back here then or- - ? Oh , no . We 're just staying with my aunt , you know , - until I can figure things out . - Right . I think Claire would go crazy if we stayed here . I don 't know . You never know . She might grow to like it here . Well , I should get going . My aunt 's expecting us back . Right . Okay . It 's good to see you , Jake . It 's good to see you , too , Amanda . Whoa , whoa , wait a sec . Would you like to maybe , uh ... I don 't know , get dinner sometime ? I don 't think so , Jake . I think I really need to spend some time alone , you know ? I understand . It 's okay . But , you know , if there 's anything that I can help you with , anything at all , just let me know . That 's sweet . Thanks . I 'm sure we 'll bump into each other again . I 'm sure we will . - Bye . - See you . ♪ I heard that air raid siren blare ♪ ♪ Before the storm blew through the air ... ♪ ♪ You can 't shoot it down ♪ ♪ You can 't fight it back ♪ ♪ You just hunker down ♪ ♪ Till the danger 's past ... ♪ All right .

He could go- - What ? No , not now . Oh , for the love of God . All right . What did I do this time , Lord ? I 'm still waiting to hear how it went with Amanda . I told you I don 't want to talk about it . Did she say how long she was here for ? Not very long . Look , I put aside a little money for Gregoropoulos . Gregoropoulos ? What for ? It 's a finder 's fee . He didn 't find it . We found it . Yeah , I know we found it , but we found it on his land . No , you 're right , Jake . The poor guy has been having a harder time than us . That 's why you 're the big bro . Whatever , sarcastic . Don 't burn the place down . - I 'll just keep working . - I doubt that . Grandpa ! Grandpa , are you okay ? What happened ? I think somebody knocked me out and stole my statue . What ? How could someone have taken the statue ? Well , you can see it 's gone , can 't you ? All right , come on . Let 's get you inside . I 'm gonna call the sheriff . - Are you all right ? - Ow . ♪ Oh , I don 't want ... ♪ ♪ Oh , I don 't want ... ♪ All right , time we got a little action . Ka-pow ! Watch out , man . Only in Redeemer . Sheriff , come in . Well , I hope you got something exciting , because this has turned out to be one very boring Saturday night . I just received a call from Earl up at the scrap yard . Well , it 's better than nothing . What 's it this time ? Kids stole firecrackers in his yard ? No , sir . Someone stole one of his metal sculptures . Who 'd want to steal something made of junk ? Well , did he give a description of the thief ? No , sir . He says they knocked him out cold before he could see who it was . Uh-huh . Really ? What 's this sculpture look like ? He says it 's 17 feet tall and weighs about a ton . 17 feet tall and weighs a ton ? You 'd need a tractor trailer to steal something that big . - I imagine so , Sheriff . - Uh-huh . Well , I guess we 'd best keep our eyes peeled for large vehicles moving through town , huh ? Copy that , sir . This is a bad idea , Grandpa . Those thieves can 't have got very far . There 's only one road out of this town , and if we move fast , we can catch them . I just really think you should let the sheriff handle this . Ha ! That flatfoot- - he can 't even handle his own old lady . Now let 's go get that bastard . No , no , no . You need to calm down . Okay ? Just take a breath , have a seat . I 'll get you a beer or something , okay ? Are you chickening out on me , son ? No , no , I 'm not . I just think we should wait for the sheriff . All right , I 'll catch the bastards myself . Grandpa , they 're long gone . Hi , Ethan . Amanda Spelling . Girl , I haven 't seen you in ages . You look the same as when I left . You haven 't aged a bit . You 've still got your baby face . You 're still just as pretty . I hear you 're some smarty-pants science teacher . You could say that , yeah . I came by to see Jake . Is he around ? You just missed him . He should be back soon if you want to wait . I can get you something to drink . I 'm sure he 'd love to see you . No , it 's all right . I have to get back to my aunt 's . You should have seen his face when he saw you today- - like he 'd seen a ghost . Oh , poor guy . I came to apologize . Apologize for what ? I could 've been nicer . Seeing your high school sweetheart after 16 years when you 're going through a nasty divorce is not the best timing . Don 't worry about it . He knows you 're going through a tough time . Yeah . Will you tell him that I 'll try to stop by before I leave ? Will do . Hey , either of you boys married yet ? Not me . I 've still got wild oats to sow . I don 't know what Jake 's problem is . You know he hasn 't had a long-term relationship with anyone but you ? I think you 're the only girl he 's ever liked . Steve ? Steve , it 's Jake Hampton . Are you around ? I 've got something for you . Hey , Steve . Steve ? Steve ? It 's Jake Hampton . You home ? Oh ! Hey , Ethan , what 's up with the lights ? Hey . Ethan . Ethan ? Ethan . Oh , no , no , no , no , no , no . Ethan . Ethan . What the- - ? What the- - ? What the- - ? Sheriff , come in . Sheriff , are you there ? Bill , do you copy ? What 's up , honey bunny ? I just got a call from Jake Hampton . His brother 's been killed . What ? Ethan ? How ? Jake says that Ethan was killed by Earl 's statue . Oh , very funny . the Hampton boys are pulling a practical joke ? Those boys and their pranks . It 's not a prank , Bill . Jake swears that he saw it with his own eyes , and he gave the same description that Earl did . All right . On my way . I hate this place . You 're still up ? It 's not my fault . The Internet here is the worst . I finally just got my emails open now . Okay , come on , shut it down now , sweetie . You can read them in the morning . I want to finish writing back to Daddy first . Okay , you can have 10 more minutes . Then it 's lights out . Deal ? Why can 't you and Daddy just make up ? Because we just can 't , not this time . 10 more minutes , okay ? Yeah . Good night , Claire . Good night , Mom . Oh , come on . Oh , my God . Mom . - Are you okay ? - Are we having an earthquake ? Auntie Beth . What 's going on , Jake ? My brother 's dead . I 'm so sorry . Ethan . Jenny , come in . Go ahead , Sheriff . Wake the coroner and tell him to get his butt to Jake 's place pronto . Is it Ethan ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . Oh , my God . Who would want to kill Ethan ? I don 't know . I don 't think this is a homicide . Looks like he got awfully sick from something . Okay , I 'm calling the coroner right now . Is she- - ? How ? What happened ? I don 't know . It looks like some kind of allergic reaction to something . - What was that thing ? - I don 't know . Oh , my God . The car won 't start . Hurry , Mom . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . What was that , Mom ? I don 't know . Are you okay ? I want to go home now . We will , baby . We will . We 're just gonna go to the sheriff 's first , okay ? Okay . Okay , okay . - Where 's my golem ? - You crazy son of a bitch , - that thing killed my brother . - Take it easy , Jake , take it easy . What are you talking about ? That thing- - that thing that you built just killed my brother . That 's crazy talk . Ethan 's dead . And it ain 't pretty . - Ethan 's really dead ? - Yeah , Earl . You 'd better stop that machine before it kills someone else . It 's not a machine , Jake . It 's a statue , and somebody stole it . That 's a load of crap , Earl . Look , Jake , I 'm sorry . I 'm truly sorry about Ethan . You know I love him . But I 'm not a rocket scientist . I couldn 't build a machine . I don 't even have a high school diploma . You 're lying . I know you 're lying because I know what I saw . You 're seriously telling me that you saw my golem walking around on its own two feet all by itself ? Yes , I saw your thing walking around on its legs by itself . It shook the freakin ' building . And he ain 't been drinking , Earl . And it 's a fact that something very strange killed Ethan . But where 'd it go ? I don 't know where it went , Earl . Maybe it went back to the scrap yard . All right , fellas , settle down . Here 's the coroner . We 'll get to the bottom of this . I 've never seen anything like this . Every artery in his body is distended . Distended ? What does that mean- - distended ? It 's when an internal pressure causes an artery to swell . Caused by what ? It would have to be some kind of extreme bacterial infection . Like that E. coli ? Yeah . I need to do blood work . You 're saying poor Ethan died from eating bad meat ? Are you kidding me ? Are you trying to blame Ethan 's death on a bad hamburger ? I saw what killed him . I saw it with my own two eyes . It wasn 't a piece of meat . Jake believes that his brother was killed by some kind of machine . I see no external injuries or bruises . This man died of internal causes . Only a severe bacterial infection could have done this . This is ridiculous . Jake , Jake , where are you going ? I need to do an autopsy right away . If this man died of E. coli , we need to trace the source . All right then , do it . Hello ? Let 's go check the bar . Come on . Oh , no , no . Jake . What do you think you 're doing , Jake ? What does it look like I 'm doing ? Are you gonna hunt down some machine you think you saw ? I 'm not crazy , Bill . I know what I saw . All right then , do me a favor and leave that rifle behind . I have a permit . I 'm not breaking any laws . Well , I 'd just hate to see you do something you might regret . Are you done ? ♪ Winners win , losers lose ♪ ♪ Until the money comes around ... ♪ All right , that 's it . Last call . It 's closing time . It ain 't closing time . Look around you , Harry . Do you see what I see ? A freakin ' empty bar , that 's what . No offense , but you 're not exactly the biggest spender in town . I remember when your pa used to pack ' em in here every night , no matter what day of the week it was . Yes , well , when times are hard , it 's small towns like ours that often get shafted . Does anyone know where the sheriff is ? She can 't come in here , Amanda . I need to use your phone . What ? Okay , but listen , she can 't be in here . If the sheriff comes by , he 'll shut me down for having a minor . No , she 's staying in here . It 's not safe out there . - What are you talking about ? - Something just killed my aunt . - What ? - What do you mean , something ? I don 't know . It was like a thing . It looked like scrap metal . It was a machine . Methinks the lady 's been in Hollywood just a little too long . I 'm serious , Tony . - What 's wrong with the phone ? - I don 't know . What ? It was working earlier . The wire must be down or something . That thing did it . It tore down the phone lines . It 's not funny . My aunt 's dead . Was this thing , like , 18 feet tall ? Was it built out of old car parts ? - Yes . - Yeah . Have you seen it ? Yeah . It 's not a machine , though . It 's a statue . My grandfather built it . That thing wasn 't a statue . It moved . It chased us . Look , it was stolen tonight , okay ? So someone must be using it to try to scare you guys . Well , whatever it is , it just killed my aunt . Hello ? Hey , anybody here ? Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'll be right back . It 's okay . I 'm just gonna look out the window and see if the sheriff 's back . Don 't get too close . It 's okay , sweetie . I brought you some water . Thank you . Listen , I 'm sorry about your aunt . Thank you . He 's here . Come on , hon . The sheriff 's back . Hey , Max , so your grandfather 's in the monster-making business now , is he ? It 's not a monster , Tony . - It 's a statue , a golem . - A what ? Sheriff . Sheriff . 'Evening , Amanda . - My aunt 's been killed . - When ? - Just an hour ago . - Where ? - At her house . - What happened ? Something infected her- - some kind of machine , a huge robot . What did it look like ? Piece of junk . Hmm , the place needs a bit of fixing , Tony . What now ? Maybe it 's the monster . Hey , hey , you be nice , okay ? It 's not a monster . It 's a golem . Isn 't that right , Max ? Yeah , you 're very funny . What the heck ? Oh , my God . It 's here . - What is ? - The monster . Where is it now ? You need a bigger gun . Did you hear that ? It sounded like shooting . Oh . Oh . Harry . Claire ! Claire ! Where 's Max ? Did he make it in ? Earl , what is going on ? Come on . Run , Amanda , run ! Amanda ! Amanda , are you all right ? - Yeah . - Okay . Come on . Watch out . Watch out ! Okay , come on , let 's get out of here . Let 's go . Let 's go . Holy crap , what was that thing ? A killer robot ? How do we stop that thing , Earl ? What in God 's name did you create , Earl ? You answer me , okay ? How do we kill that thing ? I don 't know . It 's just a statue . A statue ? A statue ? It killed my brother ! That statue killed the sheriff ! I 'm so sorry . Where 's my daughter ? Amanda , she 's- - she 's not here . - I have to find her . - She didn 't come back . Move . Let me out , Tony . Are you nuts ? You saw what those things did to the sheriff . That 's right . And my daughter is out there . - I have to find her . - Those things will kill you . A little help , please . Don 't let it touch you . Move ! Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hey , hey , hey . It 's okay . I saw Claire go with Max . She 's in good hands . Trust me , okay ? At least they 're not in here with us , right ? I mean they probably went to get help , right , Jake ? Hey ! Hey , would you slow down ? - We have to get help . - I know , I know . But the next town is , like , 20 miles away . - I told you it was a machine . - It 's not a machine . - Then what is it ? - It 's- - it 's a golem . - What 's a golem ? - It 's supposed to be for protection . So your grandfather is some kind of a wizard , then ? What ? No , he 's not a wizard . He runs a junkyard , all right ? He built a sculpture of a golem for the town 's centennial . I just- - I have no idea how it 's able to move around like that . Well , obviously , whatever he made is a machine . It 's impossible , okay ? I helped him build the thing . There 's no motors in it , there 's no computers . It 's just scrap metal . It 's all just junk . Okay . Man , this- - this can 't be happening . Well , what are those things ? What do they want ? The phones are dead . I have to find Claire . No way . It 's too dangerous out there . Well , I can 't just sit here . Look , we gotta figure out what it is that we 're up against , okay ? Oh , my God . Holy crap . What do we do ? What we do with any big bug . - No , don 't touch it . - Why not ? - Hey , back up , back up . - It 's got some kind of poisonous mold on it . That 's what just killed the sheriff . We gotta get rid of that thing , man . Are you sure that it 's a mold and not some kind of bacteria ? No , bacteria are microscopic . They can 't be seen with a naked eye . Whoa . Who cares what it is , guys ? That thing just killed the sheriff . - We gotta get rid of it . - Look , ' cause the coroner said that Ethan died from an extreme form of bacteria . And he died the exact same way that the sheriff just did . There is a rare , non-microscopic species of bacteria found in ocean sediment , but never on land . Whoa . Holy crap ! It 's after me . Somebody do something . Quick ! Quick ! Do something ! Nice one , Jake . You killed it , man . Way to go . Hell , if it 's that easy to kill , we should get our asses outside and chop up the rest of it before it gets away . Yeah . It 's not dead . Oh , man . We are so screwed . Sheriff , do you copy ? Can you hear me ? I 'm getting some kind of weird squealing on my radio . - Hey ! Help ! - Help ! - Help . - Stop . - What 's going on ? - Look , Jen , something terrible is happening in town right now . You need to call the army or something . - Yeah . - What are you guys talking about ? - It 's my grandfather 's sculpture . - You found it ? No . It 's alive . Alive ? Well , maybe . Maybe . I don 't know . But it is attacking the town right now . - Get in the back . - Are you gonna call for help ? Not until I see what the heck it is you kids are talking about . We 're telling the truth , okay ? 'Cause you gotta call - the army or something right now . - Get in the back , Max . If this is some kind of deadly bacteria , we need to start figuring a way to exterminate it . You 're the biology teacher . Huh , it does look like some kind of bacterial cell structure . Come on , guys . We don 't have time for science class . Hey , Tony , you want us to figure this out or not ? Yeah , well , we should be figuring a way out of here before that stuff spreads all over the place and kills us . I don 't think it can spread in here . It seems to only thrive on metal . Look . It 's not spreading to the wooden handle or the floor . Yeah , you 're right . It 's staying on the axe head . So the question is , if this is some new species of bacteria , where did it come from ? The satellite . - What satellite ? - Ethan and I found a crashed satellite this morning . And then we sold it to Earl . And you put some of those satellite pieces on your statue . No , I didn 't . Yeah , you did . I recognized some of the Russian writing on it . No , I didn 't . Jake , those pieces- - they must have put themselves on , just like they 're moving around outside by themselves right now . Did you say Russian ? Those commie sons of bitches . It 's a biological attack . Could that be what this is ? Is this some kind of biological weapon ? I don 't think so . I mean it 's not a toxin like Anthrax . And it 's not airborne , or we 'd all be dead . - Right . - I 've never seen a bacteria strong enough to propel its host . Host ? You mean it 's some sort of parasite ? Well , it 's using the metal surface to colonize , which means the metal is providing it with basic nutritional needs . Earl 's statue gave it a home . Well , that 's great . Everybody else in town is having their homes foreclosed , and you give this thing a place to live . Tony , it 's not his fault . Oh , God , I hope Claire 's okay . Hey , I 'm sure that she and Max are long gone by now , okay ? I don 't see anyone . Do you think that thing 's gone ? I don 't know . I don 't see it anywhere . I want to look for my mom . Where did all this happen , Max ? Just down the street a bit , by the sheriff 's office . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . What are you doing ? It 's okay . I 'm not gonna touch it . Wow . Why is it doing that ? It 's attracted to something in our bodies . You mean it 's one of them flesh-eating bacteria ? No . Given how its victims ' veins enlarge , it might be that it 's extracting something from our blood . Oh , that 's great . It 's vampire bacteria . Next thing you know , we 'll need silver bullets to stop this thing . What 's it extracting ? Well , human blood 's loaded with metals- - iron , copper , zinc . So given that this bacteria thrives on metal surfaces , it 's probably consuming the metal in our blood . So then it is alien ? If it came from the satellite . What 's this alien invader want ? Probably what all bacteria want- - to reproduce and feed . Hey , guys , it 's Deputy Jenny . We should escape now , while we can . Uh-uh , no way , not with those things out there swimming around like sharks . But they don 't seem to be moving right now . They will , once they sense blood . Hey , look at that car . It died , just like mine . Yeah , mine , too . That 's weird . The car went dead . That means that thing 's still here . Is that the bacteria that 's doing that ? Its nerve impulses are giving off an electromagnetic field . Damn , talk about a super bug . As long as she stays in the car and can radio for help , she 'll be fine . Okay , come on . I 'm telling you , Jenny , you need to call the army or something right now . How am I gonna do that , Max ? Everything 's dead . Oh , no . You shouldn 't go out there . Oh , no . Jenny . Get back in the car . Get back in the car . Jenny ! - Jenny , get back in the car , come on . - Get back in the car . No ! Get back in the car ! My mom 's in the bar . No , Jenny ! - All right , let 's go . Let 's go . - Jenny , stop ! How do we get out of here ? There 's no door handle . Mom ! Mom ! - No . - Get back in the car . - Get back in the car . - Get in the car . They can 't see us . - They 're trying to warn Jenny . - Of what ? That 's pieces from the statue . - Jenny ! - Get in here ! It 's going for her . Deputy ! - Jenny , get back in the car . - No , get back in the car . - What are you doing ? - No . Jenny ! Deputy , no ! Oh , my God . All right , this is crazy . I don 't understand what 's happening right now . Whatever it is , we need to get out of here . Mom ! Oh , my God . Look . Is that thing putting itself back together ? It sure looks that way . Oh , man , this just gets better and better . I don 't understand . How can a statue put itself together ? We should have chopped up the son of a bitch - when we had the chance . - No doubt . That thing 's coming together . I want out of the car . Get me out of the car . Mom , get me out ! Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . Someone 's in the cruiser . It 's Max . He 's trapped in the back seat . And Claire 's there , too . We need to get them out . How are we gonna do that ? That thing is putting itself together right in front of the car . - I gotta get to my truck . - Wait , wait , wait , out there right now ? I was gonna blow that thing up earlier , okay ? So I loaded a propane tank and a rifle in my truck . Now , are you sure that that thing is attracted to blood ? As much as sharks . What are you thinking ? We cover the propane tank in blood . We use it as bait . When the thing goes for it , we shoot the tank- - blows the whole thing to kingdom come . - Sounds good . - It 's good . - Yeah . - Okay . - Where are you going ? - To get my daughter . Okay , but you stay behind me . We go to the driver 's side so we don 't whet - that thing 's appetite , okay ? - Okay . - Are you ready ? - Yeah . Holy crap , it 's alive . I wouldn 't get too close if I were you . Yeah , well , you 're not me , are you ? Whoa . This is nuts . Holy crap . Mom ! Don 't get out . Get back in the car . Stay in the car . We 're going to blow it up . Okay . Sweet . What 's it doing ? Just sitting there . You got any spray cleaner ? - Spray cleaner ? - Yeah , something that kills germs . Look out . Dear God in heaven . Wait . That 's not a vein . Okay , you do it . Yeah , okay . Okay . No , no , no , I mean you cut me . No , it 's better I do this . You have to shoot the tank . This is a nightmare . What are you doing with the soap ? I 'm gonna find a way to kill this damn thing before anyone else dies . You think soap is strong enough to kill something as dangerous as this ? It says " antibacterial . " Are you okay ? Yeah . You really never had another girlfriend after me ? Nothing serious , no . You 're crazy . Half the girls in town want you . I 'm picky . Soap didn 't do crap . Maybe not , but there 's something . Trust me , we just gotta think . What else kills bacteria ? This spray cleaner says it kills germs . - It 's coming . - Get back . Hey ! Smell this , you hunk of junk . Come on . Come on , over here . - Max , let 's get out of here . - Come on . Hey ! - It 's coming . - Get back . It 's coming back . Oh , my God . Don 't touch it . Don 't touch it . Hey ! Come on , look what I got ! Hey ! Hey ! Suck on this . She 's got more balls than both of us put together . Look what I got . Get out of here . That 's it . Come on . That 's it . Come on . Come on . Get in the bar . Am I okay ? - Yeah , you 're fine . - Are you sure ? - Yeah . - Why didn 't it kill me ? I touched it . Argh . Son of a bitch . Oh , no . - Shoot the tank . - I can 't . It 's too far away . It won 't do anything . Come on . Run , Mom ! We gotta get out of here . We gotta get inside . We 'll figure it out . Claire , stay in the car . We 'll be right back , baby . Come on . Oh , God . No . Oh , no . What happened to Tony ? What do you think ? Oh . - I gotta help them . - What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna get the tank . Damn it . What are you doing ? I 'll chop that son of a bitch to pieces . Max , be careful . Are you crazy ? That 's suicide . That thing is gonna bust in the door any second . Bullets are bouncing right off it . So unless you got a better idea- - Hey ! Hey ! Want a taste of this ? Damn it . Well , we 'd better do something . Hey , want a taste of this , huh ? Jake ! Jake ! Jake , get ready . Jake ! Jake ! It 's Max . All right , everybody stay here . Open the door . Jake ! Jake , get ready ! Drop the tank . Get out of there . Run , Max ! Max , watch out ! - Shoot him . - Move now . Get out . Whoa . Max ! Max ! I 'll be damned . Help ! Amanda , look . What ? The chink in the armor . Help ! Help ! Earl . Earl ! Max , get up . Move . Go . Help ! Help ! Come on . Are you okay , Max ? Max . They don 't like booze . Earl , are you all right ? Let 's go . Let 's get you up . Let 's get out of here . Come on . What ? Oh , my God . Get up . Get up . Grab some bottles . What is that ? What are you doing ? It doesn 't like alcohol . Have a drink , you alien son of a bitch . Oh , baby . - Are you okay ? - Yeah , but I touched it . Why didn 't it kill me ? The metal was infected with a bacteria that feeds on blood iron . Thank God you 're anemic . I 'd say we got every single one of them small-fry alien bastards . What are we gonna do with all this scrap metal ? Well , I can tell you what we 're not gonna do with it . Don 't worry . I 'm retiring from the golem business . This stuff 's all going in the compactor just to be sure . Yeah , well , we 're gonna take this with us just to be sure . I 'll go get the loader . Yes . Yes , I know it 's illegal to call in a false report . This is not a hoax . What are you looking for , Earl ? My baby . She 's in here someplace . Baby ? No , no , no , no , the sheriff and the deputy are dead , okay ? You understand that ? They 're dead . There is no law enforcement in Redeemer right now . Aha , here she is . - Look , I just need you to send ... - All that for a bottle of liquor ? - ... somebody out here , okay ? - This is no ordinary bottle of liquor . This is special reserve . This is worth more than my damn truck . I 've been saving her for a special occasion . Well , surviving last night certainly qualifies . - I 'll go find some glasses . - Okay , all right , that 's fine . Well , you know where to find me , okay ? Yeah , you , too . Well , I just talked to the state police . - Did they believe you ? - Not a word . They didn 't believe the kids either . The good news is , though , they 're on their way to arrest me . - What ? What for ? - Calling in a hoax . - That 's the good news ? - Hey , at least they 're coming , right ? Are you okay ? I will be . We need to work on getting you a girlfriend . I told you I 'm picky . How picky ? Very picky . Well , nice to see something good came out of this horror show . Good timing . Oh , thank you . Thank you . Oh , man , you gotta be kidding me . That bacteria really doesn 't want to die . I sure hope they appreciate fine liquor . Well , we 're gonna have to douse the entire yard just to be sure . You got any more of that special reserve stashed away ? Do bears crap in the woods ?

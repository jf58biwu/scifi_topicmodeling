 I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For 3 generations , The Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now , our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind . 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive . We will be tested , by the earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of all , by each other . Previously on " The 100 " ... Tell me Finn didn 't make this for you . Tell me you weren 't screwing my boyfriend . I can 't tell you that . Life support on The Ark is failing . In 12 hours , 320 people will be sacrificed to boost our oxygen supply . It 'll appear to be a malfunction of the fire containment system . Then we hereby commit these souls to the deep . Aah ! Thank you . You saved my life . What the hell are you doing ? Octavia . Uhh ! - Clarke ! - Finn ? Oh , my God . Hold it down ! I got it . This is Raven Reyes calling Ark Station . Come in , Ark Station . This is Raven Reyes calling Ark Station . Please come in . Can anyone hear me ? You sure you have the right frequency ? Yeah , I 'm sure . Raven ? You can do this . Ok ? Calling Ark Station . Ark station , please come in . I 'm on the ground with the 100 . We need you . Theft of medical supplies . Illegal salvaging . Unauthorized ship launch . Pirating The Ark comm systems . Each of these crimes is punishable by death . But that will not be your fate today . - What is that ? - Never mind . It was argued convincingly that your medical expertise is still required . Thank you . It wasn 't me . The council vote was nearly unanimous . Apparently , Jake 's message woke their better angels , as well . Not so fast . We need to talk about those flares . No . We don 't . You saw them , too . We can 't just ignore what we all know it means . We don 't know what it means . It means that there is someone alive on earth . It means that our children might still be alive . More false hope . Abby , those flashes could 've been anything . Lightning . Radiation in the atmosphere . In any case , whatever they were ... That 's a matter for the council to discuss . And you are no longer on the council . Your life has been spared , but you 've been stripped of your seat at this table , effective immediately . Your pin . There it is again . Calling Ark ship . Come ... to Ark ... Station . Raven . She 's still alive . Are you there ? Please come in . Calling Ark Station . The 100 are alive . Can anyone hear me ? This is a restricted channel . Who is this ? Please identify yourself . This is Raven Reyes . I 'm from Mecha Station . I 'm transmitting from the ground . The 100 are alive . Please , you need to get Dr. Abby Griffin . Dr. Abby Griffin . Now . Hang on , Raven . We 're trying to boost your signal . Get her off The Ark-wide channel . This room only . Copy ? Can she hear me ? Did you confirm the signal 's origin ? Yes , sir . It 's coming from Earth . Raven . Are you there ? Mom ? Mom , it 's me . Clarke ? Mom , I need your help . One of our people was stabbed by a grounder . Clarke , this is the chancellor . Are you saying there are survivors on the ground ? Yes . The earth is survivable . We 're not alone . Mom , he 's dying . The knife 's still in his chest . Ok , can you patch me through to medical ? Of course . Clarke , is my son with you ? I 'm so sorry . Wells is ... Wells is dead . Clarke needs you . Patch her in to me when they 're finished I 'm gonna talk you through it step by step . Clarke , give 5 ... to medical . Medic ... What ? Raven , what 's wrong ? It 's not the radio . It 's the storm . Dr. Griffin , you should look at this . There 's a hurricane right on top of them . Clarke , we need to hurry . Ugh . Monty 's moonshine ? Pretty sure no germ can survive it . The storm 's getting worse . Monroe , close the doors . We still have people out there . Monty and Jasper still aren 't back yet . Neither is Bellamy . It 's all right . They 'll find somewhere to ride it out . Look . One suture needle . Right . I still need something to close the wound . There 's some wire on the second level . I use it for tents . - Let 's see it . - Stay away from the blue wires that run through the ceiling . I rigged it to the solar cells in the roof . That means they 're hot . You got that ? Yeah , I got that . Tell me you can do this . Hey , they 're back . Bellamy . Is that a grounder ? What the hell are you doing ? It 's time to get some answers . - Oh , you mean revenge ? - I mean intel . Get him upstairs . Bellamy , she 's right . Clarke , honey , we 're ready . Can you hear me ? Look , this is not who we are . Clarke ? It is now . The blade is at a sharp upward angle , between the sixth and seventh ribs . - Ok , how deep ? - I can 't tell how deep it goes . That 's all right . Just don 't remove the knife yet . Hey , here . Sterilize your hands . Clarke , can you see any fluid ? Hey , watch it ! Damn it ! Clear the room . Everyone , upstairs ! Now ! Let 's go ! He feels a little warm . Ok . That 's all right . Fever sometimes accompanies trauma . Clarke , I need you to tell me if there is any fluid leaking from the wound . Uh ... no . Pleural membrane 's intact . That 's good . Actually , really good . He got lucky . Hear that ? You 're lucky . Whoa ! He 's awake . Tie him tighter . The last thing we need is this bastard getting free because you screwed up . Octavia , get out of here . I told you he was protecting me . You didn 't have to do this . This isn 't about you . I 'm doing this for all of us . You did that for all of us ? I did that for Finn and Jasper and Diggs and John and Roma . It wasn 't even him . You don 't know that ! We need to know what we 're up against . How many there are and why they 're killing us . And he 's gonna tell us right now . No , Bellamy , please . Miller , get her out of here . I was there ! I ... Hey , get ... get off of me ! I don 't even think he speaks English . He won 't understand you . Oh , I think he will . Hello , Mr. Chancellor . I just need a moment . If you 're here to talk about Abby 's council seat , now is not a good time . Trust me , you need to hear this . I remember these quarters being bigger when I was chancellor . What do you want , Diana ? We need to talk . My people are angry and confused . Your people ? Yes . The workers . They 're coming to me with dangerous questions , Thelonious . Many of them lost loved ones in the culling . The belief that your administration let people die when there was another way has taken root . I don 't suppose you 're trying to convince them otherwise . If you don 't get in front of these rumors , things are gonna get ugly fast . That 's what I would do in your position . You 're not in my position , Diana . My people voted you out . You 've activated project exodus ? Congratulations . You will forever be remembered as the man who brought us back to the ground . You know I can 't talk to you about that , Diana . It 's true . We 've had our differences . But I 'm here as an ally . The decisions that you now must make implementing project exodus are unimaginably difficult . The Ark needs unity now more than ever . I hope that you can trust me enough to let me help you with that . I think we have a problem . Look . If she 's just a hair off , she could lacerate the aorta when she extracts . Ok , Clarke , firm grip on the knife . You 're gonna need to angle it upward and to the left very slightly to the left as it exits the rib cage . How very slightly ? 3 millimeters . Any more would be bad . Any less , too . 3 mil ... Clarke ? . Wait , what was that ? You dropped out . Clarke , 3 millimeters . Got it ? Yeah . Ok , I got it . Here goes . Steady hand , Clarke . You 've assisted me on trickier procedures than this . And once that knife is out , the hard part is over . All right . Extracting now . He 's waking up ! Uhh ! Hold him still . Finn , I 'm gonna get that knife out of you , ok ? Good plan . Finn , you can 't move . You got it ? Uhh . Ok . Here it goes . Nice and slow , Clarke . Finn , do not move . Almost got it . Hold still . No ! Aah ! Clarke . Aah ! All right ? Clarke . Clarke ? What 's happening ? Clarke , can you hear us ? Clarke ? It 's out . She did it . What the hell was that ? We under attack or not ? Storm damage . We 're ok . We 're gonna try this one more time . What 's your name ? Where 's your camp ? How many of you are there ? Hey . Check it out . What is all this stuff ? Hell knows with these people . Think we found something he doesn 't want us to see , Miller . These aren 't bad . It 's our camp . I 'm guessing if I counted all those marks , it would add up to 102 . 10 are crossed out . That 's how many people we 've lost . They 've been watching us ever since we got here . Ok . I 'm done . Good . Do you have anything to cover the wound ? We 'll make do , like always . Should he be this pale ? Warm , too . He 's lost a lot of blood , Raven , but if your boyfriend 's anywhere near as tough as you , I 'm sure he 'll be fine . Wait , mom , she 's right . He 's feverish , and his breathing 's uneven . You need to give him some time to recover . Let me know if he gets any worse , but I think ... I think he might just be out of the woods . Well , down here , there 's nothing but woods . I need a break . Clarke ? Clarke , wait . Raven ... could you give us a few minutes ? - Sure . - No . No . Stay with Finn . What the hell is that thing ? Friend of yours ? Get the hell out of my way . It 's ok . Let her through . Well , if he didn 't hate us before , he does now . Who cares ? How 's Finn ? Alive . His people will care . How long until they figure out where he is ? And what happens when they do ? I mean , when they come looking for him ? They will , Bellamy . Relax , princess . No one saw us take him . He was chained up in that cave the entire time , and thanks to the storm , we didn 't see a soul on the way back . Ok . In case you missed it , his people are already killing us . How many more of our people need to die until you realize we 're fighting a war ? We 're not soldiers , Bellamy . Look at him . We can 't win . You 're right . We can 't . If we don 't fight . Clarke , he 's seizing ! On my way . He was fine , then ... Get my mother on the radio now . Raven , now ! The radio 's dead ! Interference from the storm . Please don 't let him die . Is that Kane ? Marcus , you shouldn 't be here . You 're wrong , mom . This is exactly where I should be . You 've got some balls coming here . Don 't . You 're standing where my wife took her last breath . I 'm sorry . I 'm so very sorry . Tell me she didn 't die for nothing . If I did ... I 'd be lying . Then it 's true ? You knew those kids were on the ground ? - Yes . - That the earth is survivable ? - No . - You were supposed to protect us . Say something ! Enough ! Stand back ! I don 't need you to defend me . Murderers ! Put that away . Don 't make this any worse than it already is . We want answers . We want our people back . The least we can give you is the truth . Sound the signal for a general assembly . With the station representatives . What are you doing ? No more secrets . Give us room . You 've been drinking ? 320 people . If I 'd waited a day , two days ... they 'd still be alive . You didn 't make that decision alone , Marcus . Maybe not . But I pushed . I was ... I was so sure . I swore an oath to protect and defend these people . Instead ... I killed them . Pull yourself together , Kane . And then get your ass to the mess hall . Ok . It stopped . Quick , help me get him on his side . Raven , there is fluid in his lungs . He could choke . Quick . He 's burning up . Fluid in his lungs . Does that mean the knife hit something ? This isn 't blood . It 's something else . I did ... I did everything she told me . I 've seen this before . Shortness of breath . Fever . Seizing . It 's poison . Clarke , you sterilized everything . I watched you do it . Not everything . Stay here . Clarke . They locked the hatch . Hey ! Open the door ! Get out of my way , Miller . Now ! - What 's on this ? - What are you talking about ? He poisoned the blade . All this time , you knew Finn was gonna die no matter what we did . What is it ? Is there an antidote ? Clarke , he doesn 't understand you . Vials . It 's gotta be here . You 'd have to be stupid to have a poison around this long without an antidote . Which one ? Answer the question ! Show us . Please . Which one ? Our friend is dying down there and you can stop that . I 'll get him to talk . Bellamy , no . He wants Finn to die . Why can 't you see that ? Do you want him to live or not ? Clarke , you even said it yourself . This is not who we are ! He was protecting me . He saved my life . We 're talking about Finn 's life . Do it . Just tell us ! You 're gonna show us the antidote or you 're gonna wish you had . Bellamy , no . Please . Oh ! Please . Which one 's the antidote ? Just tell them . Clarke . Oh ! You are the station reps of The Ark , and I don 't blame you for losing faith in me . I kept The Ark 's oxygen crisis from you . I lied about sending the hundred to the ground . But you can tell your stations that the deception ends here . You now know the whole truth , but there is one truth that stands above all the rest . Earth ... is survivable . The 320 souls who sacrificed their lives in the culling gifted the rest of us the time that we need to make it to the ground . Mankind is going home . How do we know that 's everything ? How do we know you 're not still lying ? To cover up for the culling ? This afternoon , I declassified the minutes of all council meetings . Is that supposed to make us feel better ? All those people died for nothing . Please ... We 're all in pain . No , you don 't get to do that . You pushed the button that sucked the air out of my wife 's lungs . You caused our pain . You know nothing about how we feel . I lost my son ! I didn 't know that . I 'm sorry . My friends , please . Chancellor Jaha has sacrificed as much as any of us . But his loss , just like all of yours , is not in vain . The Chancellor 's son died finding out that Earth is survivable . And because of your wife 's sacrifice , your daughter will get to come down to the ground . That is not in vain . Ma 'am , we can 't trust them . I 'm sorry . Then trust her . As of this morning , there 's an open seat on the council . Mine to fill until the next election . We need unity now ... More than ever . What do you say , Diana ? Uhh ! Aah ! - Please stop ! - Clarke ! He 's getting worse ! We 're running out of time . Which one ? Which one is it ? If you tell us , they 'll stop . Please tell us which is the antidote and they 'll stop this . If that doesn 't work , maybe this will . Clarke , you don 't have to be here for this . I 'm not leaving until I get that antidote . Last chance . What 's taking so long ? He stopped breathing . - What ? - He started again , but next time , he might not . He won 't tell us anything . Want to bet ? What are you doing ? Showing him something new . Aah ! Oh ! Aah ! Aah ! Which one is it ? Come on ! He 's all I have . No more ! He 's letting Finn die . Octavia , no ! He won 't let me die . Octavia , what the hell did you ... Good . Thank you . Don 't touch me . How do we know if it works ? We 'll know when he wakes up . He 'll need water when he does . Do you mind ? Sure . I can 't do this without you . Hello ? Clarke ? Clarke , can you hear me ? I 'm here . Oh , thank God . The ... the storm is passing . How 's Finn doing ? I think he 'll be ok . Oh , that 's thanks to you . I 'm so proud of you . Clarke , your father would be so proud of you , too . Don 't talk about him . Clarke ... Baby , I know something else is wrong . Please tell me what it is . Dad 's dead because of you . You turned him in . I know it . Wells told me everything before he ... He let me believe that he did it , so that I 'd hate him instead of you . Clarke ... Clarke , I want you to listen to me . That was never supposed to happen . Jaha was supposed to talk him out of it . I 'm done talking to you . Clarke . No . You haven 't done that in years . It 's healing . Don 't you agree ? I don 't know who I am anymore . You 're my son . I 've done some terrible things . God will forgive you , Marcus . The question is , will you be able to forgive yourself ? Uhh . Uhh . Hey . Look , I need to clean this . Here . Let me try . I never wanted him to get hurt , Octavia . You have to know that . I just wanted to save Finn . For the record , you didn 't save Finn . That was me . But whatever you want to tell yourself to feel better . I 'm so sorry . You saved my life and look ... look at the thanks you get . I never wanted any of this to happen to you . Thank you . Hey . He just say something ? No . You know your brother doesn 't want you up here , Octavia . Let 's go . Hey . Hey . Good save . It wasn 't just me . She needs you , Finn . Raven . He 's awake . He was asking for you . I thought I lost you . We 'll get it cleaned up . I wish this was our only mess . Clarke . Who we are and who we need to be to survive are very different things . What are we gonna do with him ? We can 't keep him locked up forever . If we let him go , he 'll be back , and not alone next time . It 's not easy being in charge , is it ? I , Diana Sydney , do solemnly swear to uphold and defend the laws and the people of The Ark . Then , welcome back to the table , Councillor Sydney . Thank you . As a former chancellor , no one knows more about project exodus than you do . The good news is that we are going to the ground . The bad news is not all of us are . It 's a problem we were supposed to have 100 years to fix . What problem ? There are 2,237 people on this ark ... and there are only enough dropships to carry 700 . We are on the " Titanic " and there aren 't enough lifeboats .

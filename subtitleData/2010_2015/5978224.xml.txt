 I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face Or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For 3 generations , the Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind , 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested by the Earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of all by each other . Previously on " The 100 . " We know they 've landed , but communications are down . This wristband transmits your vital signs to the Ark . Take them off , and Ark will think we 're dying . - That 's the point . - They 've dumped you down here like lab rats to die , so why are you helping them ? Chancellor 's been shot . We have I.D.ed the shooter ... Bellamy Blake . I did something they will kill me for when they come down . Do you see that peak over there ? That 's Mount Weather . There 's a radiation-soaked forest between us - and our next meal . - We did it ! We are not alone . Clarke ! Come on . Monty . - Come on ! - We got to go ! Monty , get up ! Who are they ? What are they ? We are so screwed . Jasper . He 's alive . Clarke , wait . Wait ! Wait . Stay out of the trees . He was right there . No . Where is he ? They took him . - Talk to me , Jackson . - Rumors are spreading . Witnesses saw a dropship launch . It 's only a matter of time till the people figure out that we sent the hundred to the ground . Let the council worry about the people . I need you focused on reestablishing communication with those kids . How many dark tiles ? 23 . We 've been losing them at a steady rate all day . Abby , these are different . Vital signs spike for a longer duration before flat line ; It looks like a pain response . This is what we 'd expect to see with exposure to radiation . I know what it looks like , Jackson , but there 's another explanation . We just haven 't found it yet . Chancellor on deck . My son . - We sent them down to die . - No . We sent them down to live ... To go to Earth to see if it was survivable so that all of us could live . Abby , stop . I know this is hard , but we don 't have time for false hope . This space station is dying , and Earth is not survivable . That is what the wristbands are telling us . We don 't know what they 're telling us yet . Thelonious , listen to me . Please trust me . For all we know , those kids could be perfectly fine , including Wells . Get him ! Way to go ! I got it , I got it ! Dude , get back here ! - Move ! - Take it ! See ? Ha ha ! Hey , where 'd you get the clothes ? Buried the two kids who died during the landing . Smart . You know , I 'll take it from here . There 's always a market for ... We share based on need , just like back home . You still don 't get it , do you , Chancellor ? This is home now . Your father 's rules no longer apply . Oh , no , no , Atom . Atom , hold up . You want it back ? Take it . Get those boots ! Is this what you want ? Chaos ? What 's wrong with a little chaos ? Bellamy . Check it out . We want the Ark to think that the ground is killing us , right ? Figure it 'll look better if we suffer a little bit first . Let her go ! You can stop this . Stop this ? I 'm just getting started . Fight ! Don 't you see you can 't control this ? You 're dead . Wait . Fair fight . Aah ! This is for my father ! Drop it ! Wells ! Let him go ! Whoa . Hey ! Enough , Murphy . Octavia . Are you all right ? Yeah . Where 's the food ? We didn 't make it to Mount Weather . What the hell happened out there ? We were attacked . Attacked ? By what ? Not what . Who . It turns out , when the last man from the ground died on the Ark , he wasn 't the last grounder . It 's true . Everything we thought we knew about the ground is wrong . There are people here , survivors . The good news is , that means we can survive . Radiation won 't kill us . Yeah , the bad news is the grounders will . Where 's the kid with the goggles ? Jasper was hit . They took him . Where is your wristband ? Ask him . How many ? 24 and counting . You idiots . Life support on the Ark is failing . That 's why they brought us down here . They need to know the ground is survivable again , and we need their help against whoever is out there . If you take off your wristbands , you 're not just killing them . You 're killing us ! We 're stronger than you think . Don 't listen to her . She 's one of the privileged . If they come down , she 'll have it good . How many of you can say the same ? We can take care of ourselves . That wristband on your arm ? It makes you a prisoner . We are not prisoners anymore ! They say they 'll forgive your crimes . I say you 're not criminals ! You 're fighters , survivors ! The grounders should worry about us ! - Yeah ! - Yeah ! What do we do now ? Now we go after Jasper . Why are you here , Abby ? We both know that you could have sent an apprentice to do this . Kane 's planning a secret council meeting to vote on the culling . I need to know where you stand . I don 't have a vote . You know that . They listen to you , Thelonious . Well , you don 't . I do when you agree with me . Now , Abby , the CO2 scrubbers are already failing . The symptoms of oxygen deprivation are everywhere , and worst of all in the children ; They 'll die first . - You don 't have to tell me that . - Obviously I do . Unless we act to reduce the population , everyone on-board this space station will be dead in 4 months . We have acted . We put a hundred kids on the ground . We need to give them time ... There are 76 kids on the ground , Abby . 24 of them , including my son , are already dead . - I don 't think so . - But you have no proof . Please ... Stop . I understand your need to have hope for Clarke , but I am the Chancellor of the Ark , and hope isn 't enough . Not when the end of the human race is at stake . You wanted to see me ? Hope is everything , and the Chancellor that I voted for , he knew that . I 'm done here . Stop studying me , Kane . Who shot me ? Bellamy Blake , a janitor from factory station . He stowed away on the dropship . We 're still investigating who helped him . Who benefits most from my death ? If you have something to say , just say it . You rushed to execute the woman who saved my life , and if I were dead , you would be Chancellor now and Abby wouldn 't be here to oppose you . I followed the law . I did my job . You were the acting Chancellor ... And this job requires more than simply following the law . It requires knowing when not to . I had nothing to do with the attempt on your life , but I 'm not surprised that it happened . You 're too weak to do what now has to be done , and I 'm not the only one who knows it . There you are . When my father said they didn 't leave us anything , he really meant it . It 's just a scratch . You 're making friends fast . Keep it covered . It could get infected . Nice pack . Yeah , seat belts and insulation . I also packed part of the parachute , figured we could use it to carry out Jasper . Good . Give it to someone else . - You 're not coming with us . - My ankle 's fine . It 's not your ankle , Wells , it 's you . You came back for reinforcements . I 'm gonna help . Clarke , he 's right . We need him . So far no one else has volunteered . I 'm sorry , Monty , but you 're not going , either . Like hell I 'm not . Jasper 's my best friend . You 're too important . You were raised on farm station and recruited by engineering . - So ? - So food and communication . What 's up here , it 's gonna save us all . You figure out how to talk to the Ark and I 'll bring Jasper back . Hey . You ready ? I 'm not going anywhere , and neither should any of you . That spear was thrown with pinpoint accuracy from 300 feet . - So what , we let Jasper die ? - That 's not gonna happen . Spacewalker ? What a joke . You think you 're such an adventurer . You 're really just a coward . It 's not an adventure , Clarke , it 's a suicide mission . Build a wall . Use the fallen trees . I 'll watch out for her . Jasper looked up to you . - What the hell was it ? - I don 't know . The others said it looked like a giant snake . You could have been killed . She would have been if Jasper didn 't jump in to pull her out . You guys leaving ? I 'm coming , too . No , no . No way . Not again . He 's right . Your leg 's just gonna slow us down . I 'm here for you . Clarke , what are you doing ? I hear you have a gun . Good . Follow me . And why would I do that ? Because you want them to follow you , and right now , they 're thinking only one of us is scared . Murphy . Come with me . Atom ? My sister doesn 't leave this camp . Is that clear ? I don 't need a babysitter . Anybody touches her , they answer to me . Let 's go . You 're staying here . I 'm gonna make your life a living hell . Those guys aren 't just bullies , Clarke . They 're dangerous criminals . I 'm counting on it . Since when are we in the rescuing business , huh ? The Ark thinks the prince is dead . Once they think the princess is , too , they 'll never come down . I 'm getting that wristband , even if I have to cut off her hand to do it . Damn it , Raven . Wait for pressurization . Sorry , boys . Places to go . Did anyone notice there 's no damage to " B " dock ? " B " dock 's restricted . You know that . What , are they gonna float me for looking ? Guys , come on . An exodus ship was launched . You 're not curious about that ? It was not launched . It was ejected . According to engineering , a routine maintenance accident forced them to eject . A maintenance accident that didn 't cause any damage ? That 's a lie and you know it . Fine . Well , if that doesn 't stir your tank , how about this ? Why would they build a dropship in the first place ? Just slow down , all right ? We need to check your vitals . I 'll save you the trouble . I feel good . Prison visiting day . Tell lover boy I 'll pay him the two days ' rations I owe him when he gets out . It was 3 days . Hey , stash my gear . I 'll come back for it later . Ok , Raven , stop . Lockup 's been quarantined . There 's some kind of a virus . There 's no visitation for at least two months . Sorry . Hey , I saw that . You cheated . Hey , guys , the wall 's not gonna build itself . Walls won 't stop what 's out there . We need weapons . So build weapons . Look ... Your brother wasn 't kidding about that . He 'll hurt them . Come on . We were just talking . You 're too hot to be my brother 's bitch . - I 'm no one 's bitch . - Mmm . Good . Then prove it . Come with me . - Hey . Oof ! - Get out of here . Nobody 's bitch , huh ? Maybe one of these days you 'll realize you can 't control me . You know , that guy you with ? Did you know he was in for murder ? You want to know something funny ? I 'm actually protecting him from you . Hey , hey , hey , hey ! What are you doing ? ! Consider yourself controlled . Is this all you got ? They locked me under the floor for 16 years just for being born ! This is nothing . Ahem . You want to keep it down ? I 'm trying to concentrate . Attention . The mess hall will be closed from 2100 hours to 0800 hours for maintenance . Attention . The mess hall will be closed from 2100 hours ... Abby ... Kane 's lobbying for votes . We should , too . We 'll have our chance at the briefing . Excuse me ! Dr. Griffin . I have a question about the quarantine . My boyfriend 's in lockup . I went to go see him . Instead , I saw an open air duct . Now , if there really was a virus , wouldn 't you move to contain the airflow ? The virus isn 't airborne . That 's why the ducts are open . Can you tell me if he 's ok ? I can 't . I 'm sorry . No , you 're not . First the dropship , now this . The council 's hiding something , and I 'm gonna find out what it is . Ballsy kid . Yeah . Reminds me of someone . Hey , hold up . What 's the rush ? You don 't survive a spear through the heart . Put the gun away , Bellamy . Well , why don 't you do something about it , huh ? Jasper screamed when they moved him . If the spear struck his heart , he 'd have died instantly . It doesn 't mean we have time to waste . As soon as you take this wristband off , we can go . The only way the Ark is gonna think I 'm dead is if I 'm dead . Got it ? Brave princess . Hey , why don 't you find your own nickname ? You call this a rescue party ? Got to split up , cover more ground . Clarke , come with me . Better late than never . I like to think so . Guess we got more in common than meets the eye , huh ? We have nothing in common . No ? Both came down here to protect someone we love . Your secret 's safe with me . 'Course , for you it 's worse . With Finn around , Clarke doesn 't even see you . It 's like you 're not even here . He may not be my real brother ... ... But he 's always been there . Every memory I have , there 's Jasper . I should be out there . You 're not gonna cry , are you ? Shut up . You sure about this ? Your brother won 't approve of you helping us contact the Ark . He 's not my keeper . Let 's just do this . Let 's do it . Aah ! Ow ! - Son of a ... - Sorry . - Dead . - Oh . Damn it . If we can 't even take it off , how do you expect to turn it into a radio ? Go on . I 'll be fine . Work to do . Hey , Monty ? Jasper would understand why you stayed . How is someone raised beneath the floor not a total basket case ? Who says I 'm not ? It 's because he loves you . Your brother ? You 're not a basket case because you were loved . Yeah , I 'm a lucky girl . I 'm not saying I had it worse than you , Octavia , because I didn 't . But you have someone who would do anything for you . I envy that . I 've been thinking about Mount Weather . How come they didn 't attack until Jasper crossed the river ? It 's not like we were being quiet and they didn 't know we were there . They waited for us to cross . The river 's a boundary . Which means Mount Weather is off limits . How are we gonna get those supplies ? What are we gonna do for food ? Wow . Well , at least we don 't have to worry about water . Oh , yeah . Come on , Finn . We don 't have time for this . Clarke , we 've been hiking for hours . We need to take a break . I 'll take a break when we find Jasper . Come on . No , no . Finn ! Don 't ! Damn it , Finn ! Oh , wow . Ok . - Maybe just a minute . - Yeah . I think I know why you 're so hell-bent on finding Jasper , why you 're always taking care of everybody else . Now you sound like my mother . No . Go on . This should be good . The delinquent psychiatrist . You couldn 't save your father . Jasper . He was here . We should get the others . We 're close . Abby , we have to stop . The council vote 's in 30 minutes . Then we have 30 minutes . - Anything from engineering ? - Nothing good . According to Sinclair , even if we sent a signal down , the wristbands weren 't designed to receive , so the kids wouldn 't even hear it . There 's got to be something we missed , something that we haven 't thought of . Great . What 's falling apart now ? Hey ! Hey ! Apparently you have a thing for air ducts . I 'll call security . They 're not dying . What are you talking about ? All that 's being sent from the ground ? Transmitted by these . They 're taking them off . What ? Why would they do something so reckless ? Because we told them not to . Hello , beautiful . Hey , where are you going ? It 's ok . We 've got nothing but time . Hey , how do we know this is the right way ? We don 't . Spacewalker thinks he 's a tracker . It 's called " cutting sign . " Fourth-year earth skills . He 's good . You want to keep it down or should I paint a target on your backs ? See ? You 're invisible . What the hell was that ? Now would be a good time to take out that gun . Jasper . - Oh , my God . - Clarke , be careful . Jasper ? What the hell is this ? Clarke ! Get her up ! Pull her up ! Pull her up ! Get her ! Pull her up ! - You ok ? - Yeah . We need to get him down . I 'll climb up there and cut the vines . - Yeah , yeah , I 'm with you . - No . Stay with Clarke . And watch him . You . Let 's go . There 's a poultice on his wound . Medicine ? Why would they save his life just to string him up as live bait ? Maybe what they 're trying to catch likes its dinner to be breathing . Maybe what they 're trying to catch is us . Data indicates that the violent criminals in the group are 8 times more likely to have terminated signals . We believe that this means that the kids are taking off the wristbands by choice . So how do you explain Wells ? Kane is right . My son would ... Never take his wristband off voluntarily . Both our children have done things that we could never have predicted . The point holds . These children need more time . We don 't have time . Engineering needs 6 months to fix life support , and we 'll be out of oxygen in 4 . Nobody wants to do this , but the inescapable fact is that for every day we delay , 10 more people will need to be sacrificed . So today it 's 209 , tomorrow it 's 219 . The day after that is 229 . We 're the ones who need more time . I move that we vote now . - I second that . - Very well . The matter before us requires a 4-vote majority to pass . A vote in favor is to vote to cull 209 citizens of the Ark from the supply grid in order to extend life support for those who remain by 6 months . All those in favor ? Aye . - Aye . - Aye . All those opposed ? - Nay . - Nay . 3 votes to 3 . The Chancellor will break the tie . We didn 't ask for this . Ours was to be a transitional generation ... Ensuring that 3 generations from now mankind could go home . But everything has changed , and we will either be the generation that sees the human race return to Earth ... Or upon whose watch ... It finally ends . My son is already down there . I sent him . And the truth is I don 't know if he is alive or dead . But I still have hope . How does the Chancellor vote ? I don 't . Sir , if you abstain , the vote ends in a tie to be automatically taken up again in 10 days . That 's 10 more dead for every day . I ask again , how does the Chancellor vote ? The Chancellor abstains . You have 10 days . Hurry up , Murphy . Be careful . What the hell was that ? Grounders ? Bellamy , gun ! Now she sees you . Did someone call for a mechanic ? You 're the one who called in the work order ? We need to talk . Look , I told you I 'm not gonna say anything , ok ? I believe you , and you 're not in trouble . Follow me . Not in trouble yet , you mean . This level 's off limits for people like me . Not anymore . You know that we sent the hundred down to the ground . What you don 't know is why . The Ark is dying , Raven . Life support is on its last legs . I have 10 days to prove that Earth is survivable or they 're gonna start reducing population . 320 innocent people will be killed . I don 't get it . Why are you telling me this ? I looked up your file . You 're the youngest zero-g mechanic on the Ark in 50 years . 52 , but ... so what ? so ... You have 9 days to get this ready so I can survive a drop . God , what a piece of junk . They must have found this thing when they ... Salvaged MIR-3 in 2102 . You want me to get a 130-year-old escape pod ready to stand up to the inferno of re-entry in 9 days ? Can you do it or not ? Hell , yes , I can do it , but I 'm going with you . You 're not the only one with someone you love on the ground . Those are my terms . Take it or leave it . All right . You can come with me . You got yourself a mechanic . They 're back ! Over there . - Is he ... - He 's alive . I need boiled water and strips of cloth for bandage . - Oh ! - Oh , ho ho ! - Who 's hungry ? ! - Yeah ! Bellamy ! Whoo ! He 's stable for now , but without medicine ... They 're taking off their wristbands for food ? No way . I ... I won 't do it . You don 't have to . Whoa , whoa . Wait , wait , wait . What , you think you play by different rules ? I thought there were no rules . Hey . Atom ! Come on . We 're on first watch . Guys , you 're not just gonna leave me here . No , Atom . I won 't be disobeyed . Guys ! Bellamy ! Guys ! Bellamy !

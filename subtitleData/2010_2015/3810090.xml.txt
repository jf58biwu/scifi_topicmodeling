You heard them . They want it alive . Why ? - Is not your place to question orders , Lieutenant . It is when accosting me the lifes of my men . This should be a simple transport mission .

Atmosphere conditioning will be completed in 10 seconds . I advise you to keep yours eyes more on objective instead of me , Lieutenant . Atmospheric adaptation is complete . It is now safe to remove your helmets . Why is the prisoner not effected on tin air ? He doesn 't wear the life suit . They can adapt to almost any conditions . All this was in the file . Permission to speak freely , sir ? Permission ? It never stop you before . Go ahead . What 's the special really ? Why is that thing so important ? Does it matter ? - Yes , it does . Why ? - I lost my ship and my crew . I would like to know why . - You are a soldier . We both are . We follow orders without questions . Tell me what you know otherwise I go alone .

And it 's understood you . - Yes . This damn thing is more smart then I thought . Keep that signal going . Still on the private channel . I 'm on my way . Clea ? Clea ? She won 't be helping you anymore . We can 't get out from this planet without her . How I do use her ? - You can 't . And if you have her you still be stuck on this flooring rock as well . You get no way to go . Maybe I not plan on go anywhere . If you want a die kill yourself now and save me the trouble . What if I want to take you with me ? You do then done already .

I 'm gonna hunt you down and I wanna kill you . That 's my game . Give up , Sedonian . You will never catch me . You been out smart enough to run . Go home . Why you still got a home to go back to . I know something new I hate about your race . You packed not enough water . Because that 's more human thing . Always be prepare it . I 'm actually surprise you last as long you have . Seem how incompetent you are . Now I know why they put that helmet mask on you . You talk too much . They you want to know if I can speak your language . You are right . It 's a good for somebody like you to speak the language of the stars . Something we pick it up from the Draks . Draks are noble race . You don 't know anything about that . Nobel ? They are disease on a galaxy , filthy creatures . That 's funny . They say the same thing about you . Lying bugs . I tell you this no one miss you guys when you gone .

Those the consequence . - We didn 't enter this war . You attacked us . You were harboring Draks fugitives . - You mean refugees . Big difference . They need our help . You choose the wrong side . No . It 's cost us everything but we chose the right side . Now , it 's gonna cost you everything . We all die . That 's your solution . How can you been so naive ? Another pack will ride on our place . An endless cycle . The only way to brake it is to take control from those with power to rule them instead . You thought about this ? - No . It 's the way it is . Maybe you are right . Human . You have two options . You can come with me and survive or you can join to the rest of your race in oblivion . It 's your decision . I 'd choose option number three . What is what ? Clea ? Clea ? Are you there ? Centauri 7 ? - Yeah , it 's me . Has the human then recaptured ? - No . Then have you do retrieve me ? Radio sit it on the skeleton . Why he live it behind ? Odd , that creature is kind it dangerously so . Like he figured something else . But what is he doing ? I missing something . I wonder ... - Wonder what ? Clea ?

Do you trust me , Centauri ? - With my life . And here I do need you to do . We may have another problem . What now ? - I think my forward Commander Karza did more damage to my entire circle then I first thought . What you mean ? - My battery isn 't holding the power cells charge very well . I 'm not going to be able to conserve enough power to activate your biken when the rescue mission will arrive . Shut down the other system restraining power . I have but two main resources left from my system 's memory and your medical unit I 'm afraid you have to shutting down to until you 'll need me , Centauri . That 's not happened . Cut my meds . I don 't think that is a good idea . Cut them . Meds unit is shutting down . Your pain receptor the spank in and your heart break is increasing . - I 'm good . Meds should give us enough power provided when will ship arrived for designated time . With little luck I 'll get on him . I picking a communications from orbit . - Our pick up ? No , this is art military channel and unknown craft is approaching . They could come down here ? - Yes . But my system can track it . Try raise them . No respond . They got it to the radio silence . It can 't be good . Maybe some randeu wous with the human . Maybe is not the last one . Or they could be Draks . Great . Hey ! What ? What ? Money ? Sadonians ? They are paying you . You are bounty hunter . That is such an ugly word . Soldier of fortune more like it . They want you been alive , ha ? Just as I thought . Slyeck . What would the Slyeck be doing here ? Bounty hunter . Alpha base must he send him like a back up . It is . Alpha base or the Slyeck ? - Both . What you going to do ? He 's got my weapons and my prisoner . I gonna go get them back . True your kind will world wound ? Maybe . True or lie ? True . Deserve it they do . Scare them good you do , a ? You like Sadonians ? - No one like Sadonians . The way where we planet make slaves .

Good idea . Smart . No ! Fuck that money . I 'll be hero . No more Sadonians . - No , wait . You have your business here , Slyeck ? That human is my prisoner . He 's mine . I don 't think so . Now what ? We wait . On what ? Extraction . Ship should be here soon . What did they call you , human ? What is your name ? Jericho . Lieutenant Orn Jericho . Lieutenant ? We are the same right . I 'm Centauri 7 . I didn 't ask . Not wise to upset me consider on your position , human . No wonder your kind didn 't make it . No common sense . - Was that a reason ? I thought was you genocide war to did it . War is war . You lost . As long I 'm still alive the war ain 't over . You never did answer to my question . How were you going to destroy my planet ? Are . - What ? You said were . Past tense . It 's are . All right . How are you going to destroy my planet ? We sent as ship towards your planet feel the capacity with the filmpejlo . When 's the impact your world is blowing to dust . How long range will detective harbor before reaches ... Is clocked . You will never see it coming . Another trick we pick it up from the Draks . So , that 's why they want you alive . They want to get the ship coordinates out of you . - They 'll try . But you 'll die first . That 's right . Well , no then is no reason to keep you alive . I can kill you right now . - You could . But ? - Come on . Everybody wants to be a hero . It 's a one glimmer hope that you might be a savior world . I told you , I don 't care . They can go to the twelve hells . I don 't believe you . Centauri , I have incoming transmission . Patch it through . Commander Karzo , this is battle ship Aurora . Do you copy ? - Copy that Aurora . Karzo is dead . This is Lieutenant Centauri 7 as acting commander . Copy that , Lieutenant . We 'll arrived in the last known signal point from Prometheus before you went down . We waiting on bipen location . Clea , activate personal biken . Signal ineshiated . - Aurora , you have it ? Affirmative . It 's weak but we should be able to find . ITA in 15 minutes . - Roger that . Centauri 7 out . When we get back to Sedonia they gonna torture you . They will get the information they want . You won 't last . The plan we won 't be there by the time we arrived . - That soon ? And all this ? The wild chase to give ship the time you need it ? Get the long before we 'll do . Why plans full of people they are innocent ? They are not responsible for the war or your planet destruction ? The high counsel is . - You all fall of blindly . It 's no excuse . - It 's the law . What 's the God that you creed ? Your Gods would telling me the way to entire world ? No , we split out on different stars and surrounding races . By slaving and destroying now . They don 't accept our way of life then yes . You make me sick . This from the race that couldn 't defend them self get it other . Let lonely and beating the army . Only an ignorant species will make war against own kind . Shut up ! You command mass murder on a galactic scale and you think it 's holly crusade . This is a lie ! Unless some come as a long and takes away control from you . Your words , not mine . That will never happened . I wonder why . You are right . I do care about my world . I have wife and child there . I would like to see them again . Our women don 't fight . They care about the children . Our soldiers are up there . As one warrior to another I respectfully ask that you take this war to those responsible . You 'll just be killing the women and children . Is that what you want a legacy of your kind to be ? Vega sector , gamma quadrant . Is that ... - Where the ship is . Call your people . I 'll give them the coordinates . You better hurry . You don 't have much time . Clea ? Patch me to the Alpha base . Transmitting . Alpha base , this is Lieutenant Centauri 7 . Do you copy ? Copy Lieutenant . What is your status ?

They want me that terminated you . I saved your world . Your family . Not really . I don 't have any wife and children . That 's good and you won 't have anything to worried about when your planet blowing on bits . You didn 't think that I give you the real coordinates , did you ? We have confirmation on the craft . It 's a decoy , you idiot . No men . There is nothing but salvage on that ship . You can 't stop this . It 's already over . Superior race , ha ? I 'm giving you some advice , alien .

Find another one to do your dirty work . Centauri 7 out . End of transmission . Whatever you planning to do , Centauri I suggest you to do it quickly . It won 't be long before the human traced the source of that signal at the Sedonia . He already has . Is not that right . He didn 't kill you . Why ? Same reason you didn 't kill me . Yeah , what 's that ? I 'll tell you when I see you . Centauri , how we may suppose to get out from here ? Another our ship has to pass be around here somewhere . You realized we would be breaking 26 high council 's laws by taking this course of action . Is that a problem ? - Not at all . Let 's get to twelve hells off this rock .

 Who the hell is Dr. Hvit ? Dr. Farragut , you wanted to see me ? Yeah , I wanna show you something . Is it Peter ? No . His status is unchanged . Still no brain activity . Have a look at this . I used your protocols and a modified compound I 've been experimenting with . I substituted multiple residues at these two binding sites , added a tetrahydrofuran carbamate here , a via-Line ring here , all to reduce stearic interaction . And that 's taking the virus longer to break the SODRAs down . But it still does in the end . I 've taken this as far as I can in culture . I need to see how it reacts in living tissue . I can start animal studies to test efficacy and safety , have results in 24 hours . I 'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist , Doreen Boyle , up to speed on this . I think she could be a big help . Alan , this is progress . It has to work in the rats first . And if it does ? If it does , Hatake won 't have any more excuses . We 'll reopen Level R , start testing Julia and the rest of the infected patients . Dr. Farragut . I asked you to check in on the hour . Uninterrupted research is how we get results . If Hatake has a problem with that , he can talk to me himself . Whatever that 's worth . He left me in charge while he ... While he conducts base business . Right . Shh . Shh , someone might hear you . It hurts . I know , but you have to stay quiet . If they find you , they 'll take you back to Level R. I have to get back to my lab work . I 'll try and get back as soon as I can with more morphine . Warm , gooey chocolate brownies . A study at the University of Wisconsin showed that fantasizing about delicious food can help minimize pain . Brownies are my go-to . Cupcakes . That 's good . What kind ? The more specific , the better . Red velvet , cream cheese icing . And none of that flaky cake . I like it dense . Did it help ? A little . But now I 'm hungry . The worst part is the waiting . Death should come out of nowhere . You shouldn 't have to stare it in the face . How do you do it , knowing you 're just waiting to die ? We 're all waiting to die . I just have a little less time . What the hell are you doing ? It 's comfy . Get out of his chair . Sure . Where 's Dr. Hvit ? Who ? Dr. Hvit . I need to speak to him or her right away . No one on this base by the name of Dr. Hvit . Now get out of his chair . He 's got you well-trained . Excuse me ? How much is he paying you to inspire such loyalty ? I don 't work for him . That 's right . He adopted you . You 're like a son to him . I am his son . You know , in the favelas in Rio , the gangs , they call themselves a familia . Family . And they have a saying : Blood in , blood out . They 'd find these little boys , 9 , 10 years old , and they 'd make them murder people , to bond them to the gang . Blood in . These boys , they 'd go so deep , they 'd have no idea that they were grunts , that they were expendable . And if they disobeyed , or tried to leave the gang ? Blood out . Hatake 's down in Level R , doing God knows what . You think he left you in charge because he trusts you , or because he 's trying to distract you ? You need to get out of this office . Now . Please . We have food . There 's plenty here . We can all share . Are you sick ? Get the hell away from here . It 's a waste of time . We should get out of the hallway . We have to organize the people down here . It 's a better chance of survival . Can we talk about the real reason you don 't wanna go back ? What 's that ? The initials on the wall . Your initials . Weren 't my initials . I 've never been here . How to explain your handwriting ? Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . Nice try , but I saw them too . Is it possible you were here when you were younger ? Yeah , I must have forgotten all those family vacations to the Arctic Circle . I grew up in Montana . The most exotic place I ever went as a kid was Bozeman . Jules . What did you just call me ? If you don 't like it , I won 't call you that . No , it 's just , uh , Alan and my mother are the only ones who ever called me that . Help . Please . Doreen . Jesus . Hold on . Oh , my God . What happened ? Was she attacked by a vector ? It was the rats . The rats ? How did they get out ? Cages were turned over on her . Maybe she had some kind of heart attack , grabbed the rack , and it went down when she did . Or someone pushed it . You think someone did this on purpose ? We have annual physicals for field duty . If Doreen had any hint of cardiac distress , she 'd never have been permitted to join . Altitude changes affect individuals differently . And the CO2 scrubbers were turned off for four hours yesterday . Seems like she was in good health . Do you know how many murders have occurred at this base , Dr. Farragut ? Zero . Accidents , however , happen all the time . This wasn 't a goddamn accident ! - Until the evidence suggests other ... - Evidence ? We 're in the ass-end of nowhere , cut off . My best doctor is trapped and dying somewhere below us , and my closest friend from the CDC has very likely just been murdered . This place is a ... It 's a time bomb waiting to go off . And we 're pretending this ... These goddamn things are gonna save us . Right now , I 'm thinking the virus is not our biggest problem . I 'll review the surveillance footage immediately . No . Not alone , you won 't . Sarah , find Dr. Duchamp . Tell him to start the animal trials with the SODRA immediately . You find me if there are complications . I said we would bring food and water if they turned the oxygen scrubbers back on , but they attacked me . Bleeding is slowing , but you need stitches . We need to get you to that lab we set up for triage . That 's on the other side . We can 't drag him all the way there . Why not ? What was that ? Dr. Hatake , this is Jaye . Jaye , Hatake . Jaye ? Don 't pretend you don 't know who I am . And I won 't pretend I 'm gonna help you after you locked us here by ourselves . You did seal us up down here . I had no choice . We could not allow the infection to spread . We need to get to that lab . Close this wound . It 's too dangerous . We 'd never make it . Is there any other way across this level ? An access tunnel . It goes all the way to the other side of the base . But I would not ask you to risk your life for mine . You don 't have to ask . You need my help , I 'm gonna help you . Let 's narrow the window of incident . When was the last time you saw Dr. Boyle ? About 9 a.m. yesterday morning . In 10 hours , you didn 't check in ? I was running SODRA trials on my brother . And she was capable , she didn 't need to check in . Right . Uninterrupted research . What happened there ? The file 's been corrupted . I 'll check the backup . Uh-huh . That 's impossible . The backups have been deleted too . The only ones with access are me and ... Hatake . Who 's conveniently disappeared . Neither of us have anything to do with this . I will find out what happened to Dr. Boyle . I 'll find out myself , through an autopsy . Dr. Duchamp ? I 'm Major Balleseros . Is this another check-in ? I 'm showing no signs of infection . No . I 'm looking for a Dr. Hvit . A name I haven 't heard in a while . I was going through the research files and I saw that you two did a paper together . That was many years ago . So he 's no longer on the base ? Oh , no , he is . It 's just no one ever sees him anymore . I hear he developed a rare immune deficiency . He can no longer interact with people . He 's become somewhat of an urban legend . I heard rumors he 's in the White Room . Where can I find that ? We are all in the White Room . Excuse me . I need to speak with the major . Did you kill the CDC vet ? You 'd think I 'd remember that . Did you do it ? What did the surveillance video show ? Did Hatake know ? Ask him . He tells you everything , right ? Dr. Farragut is running an autopsy as we speak . You better hope you covered your tracks . Code 852 , Level D , Hematology . Attention . Code 852 , Level D , Hematology . Dr. Van Eigem ? Shit . Dr. Van Eigem , what are you doing ? I 'm dancing for Tony . Tony isn 't here . Of course he is . What 's wrong ? What happened ? I couldn 't stop myself . I 'm gonna turn into one of those things , aren 't I ? We need to get you back to the room . Come on . How long is it ? Forty meters . We go around . Who knows what 's waiting for us in there ? Yeah , but we don 't have time . All right , let 's go . What are we stepping on ? Looks like glass . Someone busted the lights out . Probably trying to hide . Or setting a trap . Found anything ? She died of an embolism . A scan revealed bruising in the left hemisphere of her brain consistent with an air bubble . So it was natural causes . Why would anyone have erased the security footage ? Did you see Doreen yesterday ? Just in passing . Did she say anything ? About her research ? Any breakthrough she might 've had ? No , she didn 't . I didn 't know Doreen well , but she seemed like a good person to have on your team . I knew her 15 years . She didn 't deserve this . Did she have any family ? A son from her third marriage . Hand me that bottle of alcohol . What is that ? Puncture mark . From a needle . I don 't wanna become one of those things . I know . Don 't let me . You know what I 'm asking . You 're sick . It 's the drugs talking . I was on my way to the drug stockroom ... before I saw Tony . I can 't do it myself . Please . Please . Sarah ? Sarah , it 's Alan . You all right in there ? One minute . Hey . Sorry , I was just getting changed . What 's going on ? Doreen was murdered . The autopsy proves it . How ? Somebody used a syringe to make it look like she had an embolism . They knew what they were doing . We need to be careful . Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm ... I , uh ... I just don 't know what 's going on here . I mean , Walker 's sick , Doreen 's dead , you 're telling me that somebody murdered her . I ... Are we even gonna make it out of this place alive ? Shh-shh-shh . It 's okay . It 's okay . I won 't let anything happen to you . All right ? Sarah , I ... I 'm sorry . I shouldn 't have done that . Are you high ? What ? I can barely see your pupils . What are you on ? I had a migraine , so I took something . What ? Gabapentin . You 're lying , unless you took the whole bottle . Alan , wait . I can explain ... No . There 's no excuse for this , ever . People 's lives are at stake . They 're depending on us . You 're of no use to me like this . No , you go sleep this off . We 'll deal with it later . I 'm sorry . Can we take a moment ? No , not really . Let me take a look at your wound . Oh ... We need to tie something around you for more pressure . Here , use this . And hurry up . I 'm gonna need you to lean forward for me . What was that ? Oh , my God . Rats . Where are they coming from ? what are they running from ? Run ! Get her off me ! The door ! Get to the door ! Where 's Jaye ? She was right behind me . I didn 't see her . We have to go back . It 's too late . What exactly are we looking for ? Anything salvageable of Doreen 's research . Any clue as to what she might have discovered before she ... You think there 's some kind of cover-up ? Why else would anyone kill her ? The transgenics lab . What about it ? Lab where they found the monkey was cleaned out before she had a chance to gather samples . She didn 't tell you ? No , she didn 't . Sanitized from top to bottom . Hatake must have ordered it . If it was cleaned out , where 'd she get the monkey sample she was analyzing ? Maybe some of the scientists from here were helping her . Come to think of it , she did mention a name . Dr. Hvit ? She never mentioned him to me . That 's strange . She said she spoke to him . Said he seemed to have all the answers . Well , I will find this Dr. Hvit , see if he can shed any light on the situation . I don 't know a Dr. Hvit . Doreen talked to him . She talked to him ? Doreen told you that ? No . Major Balleseros did . Major Balleseros also told me how they found the transgenics lab cleaned out . Guess you know nothing about that either . A routine sanitization procedure . That was a cover-up . Why would we wanna cover up a virus that we need you to cure ? You 're so focused on seeing us as the bad guys , you don 't see what 's right in front of you . How well do you know Major Balleseros ? I met him five days ago . Same day you met me . And you trust him ? Why ? Because he 's wearing a uniform ? How did you get those scars on your back ? There was a fire , years ago , at my home in Kyoto . The entire house was in flames when I arrived . My daughter was still inside . I tried to save her . What was she like ? Your daughter . She was smart . Curious about the world . Ha , ha . You ... You remind me of her . I haven 't heard anything outside for a while . We should try and get to the triage lab . What made you change your mind ? I know what it 's like to be in pain . The kind of pain that you would do anything to make it stop . And I 've never considered ending it , but ... Don 't we all wish that we could control when we go and how we go ? Are you sure ? Are you really sure ? Yes . Thank you . Got something . This is Semtex . Plastic explosive . Balleseros sabotaged the satellite . Because he didn 't need it to call out . He 's been sending messages to someone since we got here . Doreen 's research is on here too . He killed her . " Found Dr. Hvit in the White Room . Evac 1500 . " What is the damn White Room ? Attention . Code 517 , Level E , Virology Lab . Duchamp . Where is the White Room ? We are all in the White Room . It 's an inside joke among the base scientists . We 're in the Arctic . It 's all the White Room . They 're outside . I see you got my message . Thanks . I would never have found Hvit without you . Dr. Hatake , stay with me now . We 're almost there . Please , you can call me Hiroshi . Come on . Took you guys long enough . Nobody goes outside in a whiteout . You won 't see more than 2 feel in any direction . There are guide ropes to follow , right ? It 's not that simple . You 've never experienced anything like this . Minus 60 , and the wind chill doubles that . Fine , if you 're doing this , you stay on the guidelines around the building until you get to the line going out . Do not unclip until you get there , or else you 'll just disappear . I managed to get Tracey off of me , and then I ran . It was too dark for her to see me , I guess . I ducked into the first lab I could find , and then I came here . I thought for sure you were dead . That makes two of us . Jaye , I ... Don 't beat yourself up for closing that door . You thought I was right behind you . Looks like we make a pretty good team . - We do , don 't we ? - Unh . Good . He 's waking up . Maybe he can tell us more lies about his daughter . How did you ... ? You weren 't there . You remind me of her . I wasn 't where ? You weren 't there when Hatake told that story . They weren 't my initials . So how do you explain that it was your handwriting ? Hallucinations are one of the symptoms of the infection . No . That 's not possible . I watched you do things . We need to tie something around you for more pressure . Here . Use this . Hurry up . Hurry UP - It was you , Jules . It was all you . All those times you saved me . You saved yourself . Hey . Coming through . Switch clamps . You killed her , you bastard ! You have no idea what 's going on here . Doreen was collateral damage . Nice knowing you , doc . Did Balleseros come back through here ? I haven 't seen him . He attacked me on the ice . We need to get a security team together , go after him . You don 't need to do anything . You should have never been on that ice in the first place . He killed Doreen . Well , it looks like he almost killed you too . I 've got a reply for that message . Aah ! Hold still . Cleanup requested . Pantry , Level C. Cleanup requested . Pantry , Level C. You know why I picked you for my team , Sarah ? Because I was the best candidate . Because you were driven . I remember the first day you walked into my office ... and I thought to myself : " That girl , even when she sleeps , she tries to do it better than anyone else . " Nothing distracts us from the work . That 's the problem with laser focus , with our particular way of looking at the world . We only see the thing in front of us , the thing under the microscope , and we miss what 's happening all around . That 's why my marriage fell apart . That 's why my brother was up here in this place . I can 't keep making the same mistakes . I 'm sorry I didn 't listen to you before ... but I 'm listening now . I get these migraines . I 've had them since college , and when they come on ... I can 't think , I can 't work , I can 't do anything . I took some morphine from the drug stockroom . I thought if I just had a little bit to even me out , I 'd be able to go back to work . I 'm sorry . I 've never done anything like this , I swear . It 's okay . We 've all lost ourselves a little bit here . My team has fallen apart . Again . I lost you and Jules last time . Now I 've lost Doreen . I don 't know what to do . You were always good at that part . Even with Mom , on her worst days , you had hope . I need a little of your hope . Right now , Peter . Ripped By mstoll

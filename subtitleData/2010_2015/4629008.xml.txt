 You ain 't gonna make it . Oh , we 'll make it . Now stop popping up on my dash . Time ? Ah , 38 seconds ! The intake valve is buckling . Dude , we can 't keep this speed up ! Mike , it 's over . No ! We 're not going down like this . 19 seconds , Mikey ! You 're a man of your word . You did get here in time . Sure did . Pay up . You guys make the best custom parts in Motor City . I owe you . Yeah , you do . Oh , yeah . Right . Mike , we 've got company ! Been a pleasure doing business , but I really gotta go . Boy is crazy . All right , guys , gamma formation . Dutch , you 're on point . Got it ! Dutch , you gotta pull back , buddy , pull back ! Dutch ! No . No ! I 've lost his heat signature . Dude , I can 't locate him ! Dutch . Texas to the rescue ! - Dutch ! - I 'm all right . But I could use some new kicks . That was too close . Hey ! I totally had those bots ! - Hey ! - Get behind me . It 's safer . Mike , what 're you doing ? I had them ! Texas ! Chuck , what happened to Tex and Dutch ? Just a sec . Just a sec . Oh , Texas ! Hey , you guys okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . You guys all right ? Duh ! Of course . We 're near the south side pass . - Where are you at ? - Not quite sure . Look , there might be more Kane-bots flying around , so just lay low , and head to Antonio 's . We 'll meet you there . Roger . You okay ? What was with you back there ? Why did you cut me off ? Whoa , easy . Nothing was with me . I just ... I don 't know . Things were getting crazy out there . I can 't take any chances , all right ? I just ... I don 't know what I would do if something happened to you guys . After everything with Dutch . Hey , guys , who do you think lives there ? Whoa ! Obviously someone who loves hats . Someone would like to meet you . What are you doing ? I merely call it pizazzling . Pretty great , right ? No . Mike told us to lay low , man . You put all this Kane bot junk on your car , then everyone will see you . Shaw , everybody will see how awesome I am . Oh , there goes Texas . He 's the burner who kicks Kane 's butt . Why would you wanna call attention to yourself ? Why wouldn 't I ? Whoa ! Look at this stuff ! Wait . Chuck , stay together . Oh , so long ! Dude , they 're all so long ! Okay . Easy there , buddy . They don 't make ' em like that anymore ! Hey ! Pardon my manners . They call me the Duke of Detroit . My dear . I 'm Mike Chilton . And these are your burners . I 've heard of you . You 're making quite a name for yourself down in Motor City . Mike ... I can call you Mike , right ? You know what I love , Mike ? My cars . I 've worked these teeny weeny fingers to the bone for these cars . They are my pide and joy . My passion ! Jump back ! You got anything you love like that ? Well , my car ? You love that old Jalopy parked outside ? Mutt isn 't a Jalopy . Please . If it had wings , I 'd kill it , deep fry it , and serve it up for thankgiving . Let 's try this . Do you know what I hate ? When someone takes what I love and disrepects it ! You see ? I don 't like it when some hotshots like you bring their problems into my yard and destroy the things I love ! Destroy ? The car frame ? It was junk . Maybe to you with that Jalopy you drive , to me , it was a beautiful car waiting to be built . Oh , build me , Duke . Build me ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I can 't now because Mr. Chilton and his friends destroyed you ! Really ? We were just ... look , my friends had nothing to do with this . I was the one who crashed the bots into your stuff . If you want me to pay for the damage ... I don 't want you to pay me . I want you to show me some respect ! And I think the only way a person can convey respect is through his or her actions . Meaning ... ? Kiss my gators . All will be forgotten . Well , you can forget that . Come on , guys . We 're out of here . Okay , fine . Thanks for stopping by . Let him and his friends go . I think I need to change my shorts . Just keep walking . Looks like I 'm gonna have to teach that dog a lesson . Who does that guy think he is ? " Kiss my gators . " The guy is clearly insane ! I 'm just glad we got out of there . Could I have the triple jalapeno burger with the fries and onion rings ? Oh , and a side salad . Watching my weight , so ... You the burners ? Yeah . You 're gonna wish you wasn 't born . He-he . Get out of here . Not leaving . You 'll be safer . I can handle this . Seriously , what 's going on with you ? Hey , I 'm talking to you . Oh , guys ? He 's talking to us . - It 's mi ... - I 'm talking to you ! Get out of here , now ! I 'm not leaving ! Oh , no . Let 's move ! Boy am I hungry . They better have pie left , because sometimes I go there , and they don 't have any pie left . Wait a minute . Where are they going ? It 's a burner ! See ? I 've already got fans . I told ya . Hey ! How ya doing ? Drive now ! What 'd you do that for ? Go ! Go ! Go ! Hey ! You 're ruining my pizzazling ! You see what you did ? You turned the fans against me ! Where are you guys ? Look behind you . Hold on . You guys okay ? Yeah , no thanks to Texas . What ? I totally would 've had those guys if Mike didn 't butt in . Yeah , but if you didn 't put all this junk on your car , they would 've never realized we were burners in the first place . Ah , but they did realize we 're burners ! So what did you do to tick those guys off anyway ? Wish I knew . They were mad because their moms forgot to pick them up after hockey practice ? No , they were looking for us . We better get off the road quick . Figure this out before they come back . Where should we go ? Somewhere with food . Myh blood sugar is running on fumes . I think I know a safe place near here . They have room service too . Yes , baby . So nice . My Duke , we have visitors ! I take it by that look on your mug you failed to bring back what I asked for . Clearly , I underestimated the burners . Something that won 't happen again . Put out the call . They were definitely after the burners . Ah , it doesn 't make sense . Look , I shouldn 't be telling you this 'cause it could mean my own skin . - It was the Duke . - The Duke ? The Duke of Detroit ? - Oh , that 's not good . - You know him ? Know him enough to know he 's bad news . Look , you guys don 't have to worry , okay ? It 's me he wants . Actually , he isn 't after you . He wants them . He 's put a price on your heads . Are you saying the Duke of setroit is after ... me ? Yes ! He 's heard of me too ! Ha ! You see ? In your face , basket case . Now every gang in Motor City 's gonna be after you . Look , you 're safe as long as you 're here . I suggest you get some rest . You 're gonna need it . Yes ? They 're here . All of them . Congratulations , Rayon . You just got a whole lot richer . How did they find us ? Probably because of my car . You think ? You are the biggest imbecile I 've ever met . And the strongest . Thanks man . Rayon . Oh , that does it . We are never making specialty parts for that guy again . What 'll we do ? There 's no way I 'll let the Duke take you guys . It 's checkout time . Where 's the rest ? Where are my burners ? Till you hand ' em over , they 're still fair game . No one 's talking to you , trash . Looky here , looky here . The chickens are trying to fly the coop . Get ' em ! Just hang behind me , guys . I 'll get us out of here . What you 're doing is in our way . You gotta stop . Here we go . You keep protecting us , but who 's gonna protect you ? I 'm just trying to watch your backs out there . Having our backs is one thing , fighting our battles is another . We 're burners . We 're supposed to get mangled . Sometimes , you gotta let us take our licks . We can handle it , bro . I know . And you 're gonna get the chance to prove it . Okay , here 's the plan . If you want something done right ... Are you serious ? Think you can get away ? Eat stretch limo , baby ! No ! Let them go ! Take me ! You 're too late , Mr. Chilton . You had your chance . If only you had shown me a little respect . What are you gonna do to them ? Mmm , I don 't know . Maybe sell them to someone whose name starts with a " K " and rhymes with " pain " ? Ooh , so sad . I hope you 've learned a lesson here . - Let 's go . - Hey ! I lost a lot of cars out here ! Alas , good friends , there is no reward . Because I captured the burners . But should you feel cheated in any way , oh , feel free to take it up with that man there . All right , this should work . Okay , let 's make some noise . Texas , you 're on . - I can 't do it . - What ? You 've been trying to get people to pay attention to you all day and now you choke ? This is acting , not choking . It 's different . Not different . Oh , you think it 's so easy , Mr. lay-low , you do it . Uh-uh . No way . Come on , man . Fine . Oh . Really ? Guard ! A little help in here ! Guards ! What is it ? Our friend needs some help . Oh , I guess he 's fine . - I 'm in . - Copy that . ♪ Teacher is a preacher and he 's calling the sky ♪ ♪ I 'm free ♪ What ? Babycakes , no ! What ? You ? How did ... ? You 're all finished ! No wait , wait ! Back off ! Back off ! Did I say finished ? You 're not finished . You better know , Mr. Chilton , you harm my cars , I harm your friends . Yeah , that is a pickle . If only there was a solution . You know , someone once told me the only way that respect can be conveyed is through a person 's actions . Kiss your shoe ? Uh-uh . Which is why I will respectfully return your cars and you will respectfully return my friends . No more bounties , score settled . Now that 's what I 'm talking about ! You got some real guts , Mr. Chilton . Well played . Well played ! Meaning ... ? Meaning , you 're worthy of the Duke 's respect ! Now , put my limos back where you found them , and your friends are free . All right ! Who 's next on the karaoke ? Mr. Chilton ? Maybe next time , Duke . But I just really wanna get my friends and go . Just fooling . Go on . Told you we could take care of ourselves . Come on . Let 's get you back to your cars . Oh , did the Duke really call you a Jalopy , Mutt , baby ? He 's sorry . You are a treasure . Yeah , me and you are gonna have to get better acquainted . Here 's to having my friends back safe , and to never running into the Duke of Detroit again . All right , guys . Dig in . Mike , I gotta ask . How did you get those gang leaders to help you cross the Duke like that ? Mike ? Let 's just say , that , uh , Chuck and Dutch will be building some free specialty parts . Actually , a lot of them . - What ? - Huh ? Don 't worry , got some extra hands for you . Ain 't that right , Rayon ? You got it , man . And that , my friends , is respect . Chirp .

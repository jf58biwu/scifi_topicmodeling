[ clangs ] Shift rubble and deal crack ? - [ gun clicks ] - Fuck that . [ sirens blaring ] So when the army came looking I signed up . Now it 's my blood . The monsters out there have been walking through cities . Smashing them down . So air strike 's been hitting them hard to clear them out . Make the world safe . Trouble was all those bombs had torn up the locals , too . And that just made a whole lot more insurgents just wanna fucking kill us . So the troops on the ground , we 're out there taking them down . Stop them getting in the way of us bombing the monsters back to hell . Sergeant Frater was one of them .

It could happen any time of day . You didn 't choose to come here on vacation . Make yourself at home . This is now your normal . Everyone of you is going to have to make decisions there is no right answer to . You have the gift of aggression and you will have to act . Do not let your emotions control you . Sergeant Forrest . [ Forrest ] Now I 'm going to break it down to you like you 're in kindergarten . We have Goliaths embedded in built up areas . We bomb them , there 's collateral and the hodgies get real pissed . So what we 're dealing with is IEDs , suicide bombers , rocket-grenade attacks and ambush . Now we will take down monsters when we encounter them , but our main focus is to close down this insurgent activity . That means recon in non-permissive areas , and maintaining contact with the locals . Now , when you 're not in the shit , you keep your gear , your rifle and balls clean . Your body and your rifle are a one-weapon system . Now I 'm not going to lie to you . I think you 're a bunch of weird-looking , ugly , raggedy ass mothefruckers .

Your wife has got a way with words , man . Did she write this shit about her boyfriend ? Look at them tig ' ol bitties . I 'm trying to drive , kid . Come on , man .

[ Mike ] It was our first patrol . This corner shop belongs to the people - who run this street , on the other side . - The two guys here ? [ Mike ] I think we were all scared . Anyone said they weren 't was a fucking liar . And nobody wanted their family to get a knock on the door after day one . But they were easing us in . We needed to get out there and build up trust with the locals . Maguire , lieutenant Charlie , keep your head on a swivel . You 're watching our six . Turk , come here . - Okay , what 's your name ? - [ speaks indistinctly ] Ali . Okay , I 've seen you before . Let 's take a nice picture of you , all right . Okay , good . That 's it .

Possible signature activity at target location . Standby for confirmation . [ man over radio ] Copy . [ Forrest ] We probably blew the shit out of their main water supply last night . We should hang back for more recon . Those are the same containers they use for IEDs . We wait until nightfall , we go down , take a closer look . We finish this now . [ man ] Copy that . [ Sean ] Monsters surround , but they ain 't scaring me In the land of sand , where they only speak Ara-be Far from home , I know they 'd be missing me My girl on the phone is dreaming of kissing me Out here with Sergeant Forrest , he ain 't no Gump Got my rifle in my hand making mothefruckers jump From the D , you know , hoes and thugs Lay it down like a king , chasing giant sand bugs .

[ indistinct shouting ] - Okay , okay , okay . - Open his jacket . Very slowly . Open his jacket right now . [ speaks foreign language ] [ Forrest ] I have a clean shot . What 's going on down there ? All right , he 's clean . Do not engage . - [ Forrest ] Copy that . - [ man speaks foreign language ] [ Frater ] What 's he saying ? What the fuck 's he saying ? Okay , this is his farm . He 's a farmer . He says he has lost his children and his family . He says the bombs killed his cattle last night . [ Frater ] All right . You tell him I understand . We regret his losses . We 're here to improve his situation . He was given a chance to evacuate . They all were . [ both speaking foreign language ] He says , " Improve ? You don 't improve the situation . Do they fire rockets at your children ? " he says . [ dog barking ] [ man yelling in foreign language ] He says , " Who asked you to come here ? You are surprised we are fighting you ? " Are there insurgents here ? Are there insurgents here ? - Ask him now . - [ speaks foreign language ] He says if he speaks they will cut his throat . He says , " Listen to me . All of you listen to me . " Shut him up . Shut him up right now . He says , " This is my place . " He says , " This is my land . You cannot remove me from here , " he says . He says , " You cannot remove me , and you cannot remove the monsters . " Okay , he says , " They are under the Earth , with the dirt . " Shut him up ! He 's becoming a mothefrucking hazard ! Sergeant please advise , MTR north of your location . [ indistinct yelling ] Fifty meters ... Shut up ! Shut him up ! Back up ! Back the fuck up !

That 's exactly what we came here for , Mikey-boy . - Killing monsters , baby ! Whoo ! - Damn . Did you see me go to work on that fucker ? [ both continue indistinct ] [ sighs ] [ Forrest ] We wasn 't like that when we was kids , right ? Oh , man , when we first started ... you were . [ chuckles ] It 's like they 're taking them off the street . Maybe the sounds of mortar rounds not putting you to sleep anymore . Maybe you need the sounds of home . See your little girl . Are you fucking serious ? What , are you going soft on me ? Me ? Soft ? [ chuckles ] Listen , the last time I was home me and my wife fucked so hard the neighbors called the police . I 'm serious . The dog was wailing . Lights going on up and down the street . Car alarms sounding . Local TV crew came to watch . [ chuckling ] That was some night . I 'm telling you that , right now . Oh ...

She 's having trouble sleeping , you know . Go get her for me . I 'm not gonna get her , it 's 1 0 : 30 at night . - Let me talk to her , go get her for me . - I 'm not gonna get her . I 'm not waking her up at 1 0 : 30 at night so she can talk to you . She 's gonna have fucking nightmares , okay ? Beth can you go put the phone next to Janey , for me please ? I 'm not going to wake her , I 'm not going to say anything back , okay ? I just want to hear her breathe . [ breathing through phone ] [ Janey ] Mom ? [ Mike ] It was hard to imagine Frater outside of war . This was his eighth tour . Didn 't seem like he was even afraid of death anymore . Guess that 's how you survive out here . We 'd been on the ground for 1 2 weeks and ten days . Gone on 42 patrols , killed one monster and watched a lot of others burn . Now we got the mission . Listen up . Five hours ago , we lost comms with a unit in Altair Desert , which as you know , is deep IZ . There 's a dense population of MTRs , air strikes and hostile insurgent activity . It is our job to go in , find them and get them out . Now their last known location was Altair Village . And this here , is the unit 's evacuation corridor . This here , is one big hot zone . So we 'll fort deploy by chopper 1 2 klicks out . Take two Humvees , we go the rest of the way by road . Now they 're just like us , it could be any one of you out there in this position . I pulled down photo IDs of the men we 're looking for . I want you to burn these four mens ' faces into your heads . Because we 're not coming home with out them . That is my job to get you back safe . If anything should happen , I 'll do my best to get you out of there by road , or air . Is that clear ?

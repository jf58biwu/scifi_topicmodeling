 In the distant future or maybe in the distant past ... Human race propagate across the galaxy and founded colonies on distant planets . Their population have increased that exceeds billions of inhabitants But the resources were now exhausted , the birth rate had collapse , so that the human race is in era of decadence A movement began that advocates a return to Mother Earth . However , the planet does not support repatriation A huge conflict for the right to return started , known as the " Homecoming War " Then a governmental structure was born , the " Gaia Coalition " , which will end the war . The Gaia Coalition declared the Earth as " sacred place " where no one is allowed to enter . Instead the land was used as a symbol to watch from a distance , while the colonists on planets are dying . There was however , a man who resisted ... and continued to venture into the depths of space . A space pirate immortal in the last century and plundered to challenge warships of the Federation . Wanted by the Gaia Coalition , code S-00999 His name is - Youth is the same thing , could not be repeated . " If you continue to move forward , there will be something " To believe in it , without any suspicion . Said the city already retreated Bei Luda ? That is , the planet was over . It 's not the end of the planet , we humans . At least , until the end of her ... Foreign ship again ? No , this vibration ... A battleship ! Handing it to the youth , and holding on to his courage . It 's the Arcadia . Hurry up ! it 's running away ! However , whose name was spacious in space . Human technology , when viewed from the side of the space , it 's nothing . Only a light moment . Mutual convergence of the moment thing . Is not easy . In the Solar System and galaxy , Nothing , though continues to move forward . After getting the technology to exceed the speed of light . We know ... That man is very lonely . I heard that you need additional crew members ! We just need one . What ? Answer this , why are you here for ? Honorary . Money . Freedom ! Your name ? Yama Just don 't forget that word . That 's the symbol of the ship . Ready to sail ! Let 's go ! Kei , you take care of the newcomer . Why me ? You saved him , you 're responsibility . Mankind had suffered a setback . Hey , hurry up and walk ! Although a step forward , there aren 't any . Not change anything . Even so , why is the man ... Why try to keep moving forward ? Enemy sensors found . Confirmed it 's position in orbit point MX201 , and walked over . Warning ! Could it be ... Captain , it travels within the space velocity . 120 seconds for the ship to cross . Dark Matter Energy detected . It 's the fourth ship in the Death Shadow - Arcadia ! Captain Harlock Let me commandeer . The Captain will be taking control . All of you , move fast ! Hey ! don 't get in my way ! Prepare to engage those patrol ships ! Excuse me What are you doing ? Where 's the turrets ? Follow them straight ahead . Launching ! Target Ship to Tia DS - 1 Fighter was launched . Alpa Leader has launched aircraft to start the battle . Target the fuel supply , What pirate ships don 't have an aircraft carrier ? Preparing to maneuver the ship from above . Perform attacks from the side of the ship , What ? So fast ! Is it a real ghost ship ? Who 's occupying the vacant turret ? The new kid . Well , not bad . Target began rotating to 180 ° for escape ! # 6 and # 8 , power push air down to 12 % Captain ! Signal confirmed . It 's from Agent F111 . Everything , the anchor is being lowered . Hurry up to the hangar deck ! Anchor has been lowered . Don 't waste time . Anchor mounted gravity ready . Party time Don 't move . I embedded you a Retinal Scanner . It hurts . After a few minutes you 'll get used to it . You need to infiltrate and spy on Harlock and his crew . You saved me . Don 't wander around by yourself . The bridge is under control , faster Kei . We 're working on it . Hey you , Why are you wearing that armor ? We have finished lifting the anchors . From this moment the ship will use the navigation system manually . ... and headed to the region of the solar system . Attention the Captain 's here ! We 're going to shake free of the Federation 's pursuit . Activate the Dark Matter System ! Standby for further announcements . Roger that ! You heard the Captain , start the Dark Matter System ! There is a report of the Space Fleet area of ​ ​ MX A patrol ship fought the ship Arcadia . Agent F111 , has managed to slip in according to plan . Goods orders ? We will soon find them . If she doesn 't have that thing , we could have capture that fugitive Harlock . She is a 100-year-old rebel , who has tarnished Gaia Coalition . He must be stop . Make sure to finish the full power to Gaia Fleet mine . Does the agent can be trusted ? Yes . Ezra , His Majesty was very pleased in your loyalty . It 's my honor sir . We look forward in hearing the good news . Making his younger brother a spy ? That task must be hard for him . Maybe a Gaia Fleet Commander title will be given to a young child . He 's quite young to serve the Gaia Fleet . What could possibly go wrong ? If only there was an accident , he would have been awarded as an officer . He needs more luck , if he wants that position . Nami . Why Ezra ? Why did you gave the mission to Yama ? You don 't agree ? I didn 't force him . He decided on his own . Commander it 's time for planning the meeting .. Understood . I 'm not interested in the army , I want to be like my mother 's plant researchers . Amazing isn 't it ? Arcadia is equipped with self-repair system . On that point was damaged completely . That part also . The distance that can be reached by Dark Matter Energy is infinite . The ship doesn 't need to port for charging fuel for the trip . Dark Matter Energy ? That ... 100 years ago , during the " Homecoming war " A lost alien civilization called Nibelung , Created a machine that can continue to move the energy . But , we don 't know how to use it . Only the Nibelung race can operate that thing . She was the only survivor . The only alien civilized to communicate with humans . But to be able to understand each other more is still far ahead . Can I ask something , Mr. Yattaran ? Sure . Is it true , the captain is over 100 years old ? Legend what made-up a hero . Don 't want to find out . Here a lot of people who have criminal records . Just like you . I ... Everyone is disappointed , Everyone is speaking about " Gaia " which can not been proven . Humans are just wasting their lives . If you 're born in this era , Isn 't it great if we just do what we want ? Right ? Regarding the status of the sound waves ... Is there a problem ? No , we don 't find any problems . Then you should be clear to the point . Where it is hidden ? A central computer system ... Is the source of energy ? My friend , Soon our long journey ... Don 't do it here . Time will come . Please leave . Why did you let him aboard ? You know it , right ? What are you planning to do ? Miracle . You 'll laugh if I tell you . I just ... Want to make sure . 8th planet of the Grahm galaxy . Tokaga . The 99th will be mounted on that planet . What 's 99th ? It 's a Dimensional Oscillation Warhead . Humans tried to live on that planet , but eventually they gave up . This job is more dangerous than your usual . Who will volunteer ? Why ? Nobody ? I 'll go . You can 't . You 're still a beginner ... In any case , there will always be a beginning . Well then , proceed to the hangar deck after 10 minutes . Why did you sign up ? To be able to survive on this ship . There 's only fate or cooperation . - And also ... - Besides that ? I want to see the Captain 's face . By the way that warhead , where is it ? We 'll be there soon . A camouflage . Dimensional Oscillation Warhead ... He said that this is the 99th . You install this kind of thing . You want to launch a terror attack ? Do not ask unnecessary things . Ensure coordinates . North latitude 32 ° 7 ' . West Longitude 126 ° 7 . Jim Dal hills in the east . Jimwest hill in the southern districts of Mark . Coordinates established . Preparing for landing . We 're now ready to enter the job zone . Be careful with the tablets of corrosive gases . This area here has very strong corrosive gas pressures . Task completion time limit is 1 hour ... Come on , let 's do this . They better stay hidden . Because nobody knows what they will do . I think there 's a researcher who examined these creatures . Then ? She 's supposed to work before , but she went crazy . I think I started to feel weird . So , start it again then . Start again ? Although it 's been searched all over the space . There 's no man regarded a planet other than the Earth . They all , wanted to go home . But because the Gaia Coalition made the Earth a sacred land , The hometown that we lived in is gone . We can make it . If we all go home , the Earth could be flat , right ? But , everyone said that the human race will soon come to an end . Humans are now scattered throughout the galaxy . As if his personal desire will soon to disappear . At least the last moment . Don 't you want to spend your life in our own planet ? There is only one way ... Going back to the days , where humans are still living on Earth . How ? Releasing the past controls of the future intersection . Intersection ... time ? In this space , there 's a place that became a time relationship area . If we can release it , then we will be freed from the bonds of time . That way we will be free from interconnected flow of time , In this space . But , a huge explosion is needed . And the bonds that connect the space . Must be removed one by one . And it will ... For now , 98 warheads were mounted on different planets . If we can put two more warheads , we can blow them up . Then the time will be in separated junction . But those are the words of Captain . Explosion , for that matter ... But I don 't understand . Return , and begin again . People are no longer concerned with beautiful words like that , isn 't it ? I believe the Captain . Besides , I don 't want to end like this . I don 't want to die lonely . What 's going on ? I don 't know this would happen . Hurry ! Let 's go back ! That 's not a rock formation but the back of Omda Mood ! Oh crap . Are you alright ? Yes , I 'm okay . Let me go , I want to go back there ! Don 't be silly , do you want to die ? It was my fault that I fell . There are corrosive gases in there . You 'll also get involved . But if this continues ... What an unlucky guy . No way ! Captain ? They withered , also this one . Why ? Since the beginning it 's not possible , Yama . These flowers only bloom on Earth ... On Mars , is mother 's dream isn 't it ? Yama Stop , that 's dangerous ! Brother ! Brother ... Don 't come ! Don 't come here ... You 're like this ... So ... Tell me brother , What should I do ? Be my legs . Instead of me walking , running in the battlefield . That 's your ... Retribution . Captain , you 're close to the source of corrosive gas explosion . The source of the blast is still active ... I can 't disconnect the warhead , it needs to get out manually . You noticed it , didn 't you ? That I 'm from Gaia Fleet ? As long as you 're on the Arcadia , you 're my crew . That 's very stupid . My mission is to get the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead , And to kill you ! Is this what you wanted ? The possibility of your mission 's success is only 1 : 10,000 . Even if you succeed , no one will acknowledge it . But there 's one person who would do such stupid thing . Yourself . Is the channel not connected yet ? Radio waves don 't react to any sound ... There 's no signs of life . The Captain risk his life just for that kid ? If the same thing happens to us ... Captain will also do that . Captain , With you , we are ... I 'm not willingly doing this , I 'm not ... Freedom . You said that while boarding for Arcadia . If what you said was true , Fight against the ones that bind yourself . If you still want me dead , Then shoot me . Maybe you can kill me . I wanted to hit you 2-3 times ... But forget it . What matters is that you return home safely . The ones that bind yourself ... Fight it . With the rest of the warheads deployed , The installation of 99th warhead has finished . Finally , galactic coordinates set of 0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude . Our hometown . Earth . Earth . Earth . Earth . They said that Arcadia is speeding towards the solar system . The time has come . Why is there 's no contact with him ? There was a communication interference . Don 't let them get close to the Earth . Please allow us to use the " Kaleido Star " system . This will provide the destruction of the Arcadia . Kaleido Star System ? That system produces energy by blowing neutron stars . Owned by the galactic resource management . What if Harlock detonate his Dimensional Oscillation Warheads ? For them , the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead is the last weapon to unlock time relationship . It 's not likely to be used soon . Using the Kaleido Star System will insure our victory . There 's a problem , it could blow up the space . Many of our units will die . Your Majesty , your decision please . The use of the Kaleido Star System is permitted . Destroy them , by all means . You 're not surprised that the communication with Yama was disrupted . In a battleplan , a desire for revenge must be included . You planned this since the beginning . Why do you hate him so much ? ! Gaia Coalition 's based on the higher commands . Commanded all Gaia Fleet , Entire fleet prepare for take off . Repeat , entire fleet prepare for take off . Entire fleet , ready for take off . Roger that , everything is prepared for takeoff . After reaching the specified coordinates , all initiate warp drive . 45 minutes after the speed of light is confirmed , go to the " In Skip " zone . Oceanus ascertain the position , celestial coordinates are complete . Here 's the main fleet forces , Commander Lu Guardian . Under the Commander Ezra 's order , All fleet , prepared to enter " In Skip " zone . And ready for attack . Commander , your oder . Let 's welcome the Arcadia within the Solar System . Prepare for battle ! Roger . The combined fleet , poised in the " Skip Out " zone . Pluto coordinates , will be used as a defense outside of the Solar System . All fleet go to the " In Skip " zone . My friend , This is the final voyage of our journey ... Confused ? At a time like this ? Warning ! Enemy fleet detected ! Confirmed the distance of the enemies ranging 36,000 light-years away . The defense is in the outermost orbit of the Solar System . Also confirmed the presence of the enemy at close range . With more speed roughly from 0.24 the speed of light . Damn , they challenge us for war . Your orders , Captain ? Full speed ahead . We 'll break them down . Roger ! Dark Energy Matter running at full speed . Preparing all the firing equipments . Preparing for attacking and shooting formation ! Remarkable isn 't it ? Arcadia still lies ahead . They orbit around the outer solar system defenses . Preparing to break the defenses . Confirmed the existence of Dark Matter Shield . All guns are ready to fire on Arcadia . Awaiting your command . More ... Provoke them more . Brother . Now ! Entire fleet launch the attack ! Warning ! Our ships are shooting each other ... Hold your fire ! Hold your fire ! Stop shooting each other ! Immediately give emergency warning ! Hologram ? Report the emergency situation . Confirmed the Arcadia is outside the rings of Saturn . Commander ? Alright ! 2nd Fleet go to " In Skip " . At a distance of 74,000 light years , confirmed the presence of the enemy around 136 units . Very close distance . That is , they have read it yes ... Think the enemy is not that stupid . Yama . Message from the ship Arcadia . Accessing Gaia Fleet 's passcode . Connect me . Brother ... You 're still alive . Command the fleet to go . Harlock 's goal isn 't to destroy the universe . It 's just a one-sided assessment of an officer . If you talk to him , you 'll understand . Is that all you can say ? You disappoint me . Disconnect . Brother ! Bring in the Kaleido Star System . Kaleido Star System which converts the power revolution of neutron stars . Blowing them up and turn them into cosmic rays . All will be destroyed , including Arcadia . 2nd Fleet from 84 to 93 , accelerate powers rotation both sides of Arcadia . Let light dispel the darkness , that you bring hundred years ago . Outside of the ship , there are 4 levels of gravity force ! What did you say ? That 's huge ... Estimated area of destruction is quite large . Cosmic rays ... Fire ! Reports of debris ... Defense managed to maintain all of them . - Kaleido Star System entering cool down state . - Debris damaged by the attack . As a result of interference of electromagnetic , wave sensors are not working . It takes about 2 minutes to fire again . Just use the telescope manually . Maintain the conditions . There is no trace of Arcadia . Is it destroyed ? It 's not . Absolutely no response . There 's no way it 's still a hologram . Why ? Why is this plan also failed ? There are signs of the emergence of Arcadia on the top side . What did you say ? The ships are too late to dodge ! Battlecruiser " Nei Lede " completely destroyed . " Ares " also destroyed . Immediately refill the vacancy of fighter fleet . The Arcadia disappeared during a route of gravity . Here ... Arcadia is heading here ! Yama ... 97 % of the fleet has been completely destroyed ! Only 17 of the fleet are left inlcuding the Oceanus . We can 't fight them in this condition . Brother , resisting is useless . Gaia Fleet Combat Ship is in very bad condition . Why don 't you just throw it away ? I don 't ... If we bring the Oceanus , the Gaia Coalition will know that we have a prisoners . You 're improving your skills , huh ? Thanks to you , brother . I told you about the ambush planned by the 2nd fleet . You should know better than that . Nami , right ? Stay her out of this . I want to bet on Harlock . With the release of time relationship , people can start over again . That way , we will ... Start over ? You don 't know anything . Soon , we will enter the Earth 's orbit . It 's been 100 years , our hometown the Earth crosses the time . From there , we will start again . But planting the Dimensional Oscillation Warhead , wouldn 't that make the Earth explode too ? That 's the Captain ' s decision . He must have been thought this thoroughly . Harlock is deceiving you guys . Soon we will enter the sacred zone ... Make sure you see it clearly . What 's that ? A hologram ? The Earth , is just an illusion ? What is this exactly ? This is ... Harlock had committed a great sin . The blue surface is just a holographic projection ? Captain ! 100 years ago , humans scattered throughout the universe ... Earth revolves around the right to return war . The " Homecoming war " Tired of endless human conflicts . The Gaia Coalition wanted to end the war . Declaring it as " Sacred Place " All people are restricted to enter . That time , the Earth was guarded by the Gaia Fleet . Harlock was on board the battlecruiser , named " Death Shadow " Harlock was ? There are 4 kinds of Death Shadow ships which are equipped with Dark Matter . An invincible " Armada " A technology which will revive the life that has been lost ... A scientist of Gaia Fleet ... Harlock 's only close friend . He provides assistance to our people who are facing doom . That 's why we gave him our legacy technology . Harlock continued to protect the Earth . However ... The Gaia Coalition officials can enter the Earth freely . That was the term in exchange for peace . War will not just end with promising words . But ... He didn 't want to accept it . Earth must be a sacred place . Because of that , Harlock began to fight . He hated the traitors of Gaia Coalition . Tochiro ! So is the Gaia Coalition towards him . Tochiro ... Harlock was cornered . He ordered to activate the Dark Matter Energy . " If the Dark Matter would cover the Earth then the Earth would actually be holy ground . " I wish I knew how dangerous it was . I should have stop him . Harlock 's expectation didn 't met . By itself , the Dark Matter surrounded the Earth . It devoured the Earth 's entire surface . All was gone , that 's what everyone thought . But ... He came back to life . Not the same person as we knew . But as a cursed pirate who was possessed with Dark Matter . 5 years after the end of the war , He stole 100 pieces of Dimensional Oscillation Warheads owned by the Gaia Coalition . Then Harlock disappeared . The goal was .. If he managed to adjust to the time relations theory , proposed by Nibelung race Gaia Coalition will reach it 's end . He can 't bear the burden and wanted to destroy everything . Yama , What about you ? If we remove the intersection of time ... What will happen to the universe ? Gases that exist in infinite space ... Is connected to a line called the relationship time . If the lines are removed , All will return to nothingness , And we will be reborn . So that whether ... What do you mean ? There 's is no other way . Mankind , Just like the light of a historical moment for the space . Meaning that there is there . And contained therein , Will be destroyed without conveyed , Since mankind realized it , they will want the Earth back . And want to go back to their mother planet , To the era where the world can still be occupied . But , like the Earth which no longer exists . " Start again " so that the Earth would change . By getting this cursed ship ... And the body which is not allowed to die , That 's all I ... It 's not your fault . If you didn 't saved us Captain , we certainly don 't have the place to go back . There 's no other way like that ... Kei , you blew the Dimensional Oscialltion Warhead ... Why ? Harlock . By accepting everything , Definitely there will be a way of life for you . Miime ? What is this ? We 're starting to move away from the Earth . Who 's doing this ? My friend ... Are you also betraying me ? " Oceanus " and the prisoners are free , somebody help them . Here in the mechanical room there 's a group of people who attacked us ! What is it ? Quickly report ! Emergency room is closed ! Why do they carry guns ? Don 't let them get into the bridge ! You ! Kei you said that , You don 't want to die lonely . All are the same . But who knows , some are not expecting the end like that . But ... So , this is your answer ? Maybe in vain . Bacause that body can not die . No , if this body remains , it can be killed . Criminal Codename S-OO999 , Harlock . Because of intentionally violating the agreement on Article 62 . You 're under arrest . Breaking news has been received , There is a declaration of the Gaia Coalition . Criminals who were destroying the peace and was wanted for nearly 100 years . Space Pirate Captain Harlock and his 40 crew members , Is reported to have been caught by the Gaia Fleet . You are now in-charge here . Brother , regarding Nami ? She 's my wife . Why did you betray me ? Of course . Your heart only belongs to Yama . You don 't know anything huh ? I want to return the favor . I wanted to eliminate your hatred . Don 't try to lecture me ! Look ... Who 's responsible for making you look like this ? Nevertheless , You still choose him . I realize now , What made you suffer is not Yama . But me . To be honest , I 've always loved Yama . Shut up ! I never loved you at all . That 's enough ! Don 't say it ! Never at all . Stop it ! I lied to you . I 'm sorry , Ezra Nami ... I love this place . And also ... You . Fool ... Fool ! Fool ! Fool ! Fool ! Take this . This is her legacy stuff . She 'll able to communicate with you , the Network has renewed . Her health equipment had malfunctioned . It 's a pity . That 's a lie ... Ezra , you ! Look , Yama These flowers only grows on Earth . It 's your mother 's flower . It turned out to be strong and bloomed beautifully I persuaded Ezra to make me a greenhouse . I want you to see these also . I was never against you . You always assumed that alone . It only made you suffer . If only I could move . I want to tell you " throw it all away " But at that moment , Ezra has been always at my side . His gentleness made ​ ​ me feel at ease . That 's why I chose Ezra . So don 't blame yourself . Someday if you meet that important person , Just remember me . We are a family . Looks like you 're starting to look weak . As for the plan , This afternoon , is the execution time of your death . Your source of immortality , If the Dark Matter is forcibly removed , The curse will disappear . I want to know , Why can 't you die alone ? Do you really want to start again ? Although it knew that it was an illusion . There are times where we want to keep on believing . Everyone , Definitely liked it . I will bless you . That way you will be free . Today , Just a few moment , Space Pirate Captain Harlock and crew , Will be executed by Gaia Fleet 's policy . It is broadcast from the network Gaia Coalition . The Union Leaders had arrived at Parliament House . Gaia is the only one and irreplaceable . For order and peace . For order and peace . Our hometown , Which became our Mother Earth . Gaia .

It 's really just a waste . Not that you actually know . Why you ? ! Stop . It doesn 't look good . You 're plan ? Because we don 't have a place to go . Except on that ship . Are you satisfied ? What ? You want to die together with Captain ? Just like Yama said , You 're the worst ! You don 't have the right to complain ! Neither you or me . I just couldn 't say anything , seeing Captain 's despair . 10 minutes before the time of execution . Guard forces , all are expected to reverse . Repeat , Guard forces , all of them are expected to reverse . Hey , there was an order for retreat . What is he doing ? In the formation of electrical energy , a special shield is prepared . Osmotic quantum gravity diversing the state . Ready to enter the anti-gravity condition . Frequency gravitational collapse reaches the critical zone . Pressure setbacks , Breakthrough properties are beyond the outermost orbit . 10 seconds before the time of execution . 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... There was an explosion in the fuel unit ! Fuel are damage . The Dark Matter Energy is leaking ! Get out now ! What do you mean ? I was wrong ... You 're aware ? ! Not only the Gaia Coalition is wrong , Harlock , everyone is wrong You 'll get what I mean if we go to Earth . There are things I want to show . Why do we believe in you ? I 'll explain this later . The guards will be coming soon . Let 's escape with the ship . Hey , do you believe in him ? If you want to die , stay here . Let 's go . Damn . Switch to ship 's interior . Ok ! What does this mean ? A rebellion ... Someone has delayed the execution . Quickly terminate the broadcast ! Dispose them at once ! I understand . Everyone , get ready for battle .

This moment has repeated , To live again ... Is this ... Freedom ? My friend ... The Dark Matter Energy continues to strengthen . It can 't be control . Fleeing in which direction ? To that direction . To the sacred zone , Earth ? Tell the whole army to go to the Solar System . Don 't let the Arcadia get close to Earth . What 's the status of the Oceanus ? Restoration is not yet complete . Dynamic operation can be a started . Let 's go ! Amazing , this ship moves by itself ... Setting the coordinates to Earth , Could it be the intersection of time ? Yattaran . Hack on the Gaia Coalition Galaxy Communications . By using space satellites , live feed will be broadcast to the entire universe . We will destroy the hologram from the Earth satellites . With that , it will show the universe the whole truth . Yama , Show them the true face of the Earth . They are in the zone very close to the area In Skip . The next one will not be predictable . Entire Fleet . Get ready for battle ! The numbers are incredible ! Our goal is the hologram satellites . Don 't put your attention on them . Yattaran , not yet ? It 's not that simple as you think . They 're targeting the hologram satellites . Don 't let them succeed ! Hull armor in critical condition ! Yattaran ! Alright then . Here we go , here we go , here we go , here we go , here we go ! Successful entry into the Gaia Coalition 's galaxy communications network ! Yama ... We can 't avoided it ! This is from the Arcadia ... To the whole human race born of the Earth . I want you to accept this without ignoring it . The thing appears in front of you , Gaia Coalition wanted to hide ... The true face of the Earth . Because of past wars , this beautiful planet has turned into this . Does the broadcasts can 't be stopped ? But ... Our hope is not in despair . The Earth is still alive Life has re-emerged in the land that should have been dead . Life is fragile . But not only that , it was a moment that keeps recurring . Don 't just rely on illusions . Don 't be afraid to face reality . We would be able to give birth to the true starting point . We are not alone . Even if our race is diminishing , The next life will continue to grow . Let 's keep looking forward Until the last second , Let 's take the whole life , And make it immortal ! That 's stupid ! If this continues , the actual form of the space will be revealed . If we don 't stop the Arcadia as soon as possible ... Do not panic . The use of the Jovian Blaster will be allowed . Jovian Blaster ? It is the latest weapon that has not been perfect since its creation . Complete the mission using this ultimate weapon . However ... If we are targeting Arcadia it 's located close to the Earth 's orbit . Earth will also ... Our sacred place , Is a beautiful blue Earth . No need for reality . Please wait ! Your Majesty ! Retreat the fleet , Ezra . Enemy ships are retreating . What are they doing ? That Gaia Fleet guy , Gave up after knowing the reality ? There 's a ship approaching ... The Oceanus ! Ezra . Get ready for a counterattack ! Why is this happening ? The enemy has anchored the ship ! What is anchor ? Damn ! It is our expertise ! Kei , are you alright ? This is not your style ... Yattaran ! I 'm not running away anymore ! Ezra , where are you ? Get out of my way ! Arctic electromagnetic waves , South pole improved . Jovian 's rotation speed increases , ready for charging . Plasma body is loaded from the pivot point of the planet . Jovian Blaster reaches 60 % Rotation rate is still rising Jupiter will gradually be deformed ... Still need 180 seconds , before it 's ready to fire . Oceanus is connected with our Arcadia , can 't be separated . If this ... Never mind There will be many successor . " Don 't despair " you say ? Are you planning to be a hero , Yama ? Where are you Ezra ? You can 't even save the woman you love . Saving human race ? What a joke . I got you now . You are too naive . Even it 's the interest of our mother ... You 're too dependent on fragile objects ! But the flowers ... Bloomed ! You 're too late ! If not from you , Nami would not have been dead ! That is just a test fire , the next beam will be fired from the Jupiter . It will destroy the Earth along with the Arcadia . You ... Captain , please go . Mime , I want you to do something ... Protect the Earth . Only you still have that desire until the end . It can 't be fully controlled . Does not matter . The testing was good enough . Because the new active again after the " Homecoming War " . What can make it . Reloading almost complete ! Rate of speed into a body producing plasma - 2 is 95 % . Plasma body ready to be filled Plasma body is in charge . The relationship between gate vault and orbit of the solar system has been connected . Target " Ship Arcadia " has been determined . Automatic tracking machine has deployed . With this , everything will fall asleep . It doesn 't matter if it is an illusion . Afet all , our life isn 't eternal . Harlock . In this way , I 'm sorry Miime . You must ... Never mind . I don 't feel lonely anymore . Because I knew that connects , Destruction will be converted into a new life . Dark Matter Energy , full open . This can 't be . What happened ? Aracadia changed course . So the Earth has spared the laser beam . Oceanus Ezra Allowing the Earth to be saved . While hitting the Arcadia . Why ? I wanted to see , Nami 's flowers They 're beautiful . Brother ... Brother ! When the Earth is trying to revive again . People will be interested in this planet . Therefore , before the Homecoming War to happen again . You must immediately release the crossing time . Dark Matter has been used up . And maybe you could kill me at this time . Shoot or not ? It is a world that is inherited by Nami and Ezra , Once is enough . If later , humans make a mistake again . I won 't hesitate to bring them ... Curse and terror . Is the thing that will always happen . As long as there are human beings , The named Captain Harlock , Must always survive . Forever . This is the Space Forces . We must know your position . Occupants are expected to leave the ship . And surrender without resistance . If you don 't reply , It will be declared that you " don 't want to surrrender " We will launch an attack . I am a woman who dedicated her life to Harlock . Living together with Arcadia , Died with Arcadia . Arcadia . Full sail ! Human had suffered a setback . Although a step forward , there will not be any . And will not change anything . But , why is the man , Still trying to move forward ? Recall that day Just the thought of another day Why are we on this end How did we end up this way What we 've done What did we do wrong ? God ah God Despite the rush hour flow to Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close Always makes me like shoulder the burden Always weighing on my shoulder Extraordinary moment A time like no other That day changed everything It all changed on that day Grief and endless pain Sadness and so much pain You can feel my sorrow You can touch the sorrow here I do not know what to blame I don 't know what to blame Just watched repeatedly in the side I just watch and watch again Even if the flow of time to rush Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close Even if the flow of time to rush Even though the days go on That day has long gone So far so far away from I still feel fresh in our memory It seems so close It is what is left What did it leave behind ? And from here we take and erase what What did it take from us and wash away ? Maybe a long way It may be long But as long as we re ' heart ' start But with our hearts start a new Keep the faith and never give up And keep it up and not give up And head forward With our heads held high You have entered hell and come back again You have seen hell and made it back again How to forget ? We can not forget How to forget ? We can 't forget Along those lost souls The lives that were lost along the way Later , you will realize that no matter where And then you realize that wherever you go Both to the security of There you are Waits for no man Time won 't stop So we never stop So we keep moving on Last night turned into light Yesterday 's night turns to light Nights return to light Tomorrow 's night returns to light To become the light Be the light Always makes me like shoulder the burden Always weighing on my shoulder Extraordinary moment A time like no other That day changed everything It all changed on that day Grief and endless pain Sadness and so much pain Anyone can close your eyes Anyone can close their eyes Pretend everything goes smoothly Pretend that nothing is wrong Open your eyes Open your eyes To find the light And look for light That day what is left What did it leave behind ? And from here we take and erase what What did it take from us and wash away ? Maybe a long way It may be long But as long as we re ' heart ' start But with our hearts start a new Keep the faith and never give up And keep it up and not give up And head forward With our heads held high You have entered hell and come back again You have seen hell and made it back again How to forget ?

We can 't forget Along those lost souls The lives that were lost along the way Later , you will realize that no matter where And then you realize that wherever you go Both to the security of There you are Waits for no man Time won 't stop So we never stop So we keep moving on Last night turned into light Yesterday 's night turns to light Tonight reconciled light Tomorrow 's night returns to light To become the light Be the light Some days as superficial Some days just pass by But some day memorable And some days are unforgettable We can not choose the answer We can 't choose the reason why But we can choice tomorrow But we can choose what to do from the day after So let us hope that this firm which full determination So with that hope , with that determination Will create a brighter tomorrow and beautiful Let 's make tomorrow a brighter and better day I e s p e c = " w i n d o w s l o g o f f s o u n d . w a v " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ a s s e m b l y \ g a c _ 6 4 \ c u s t o m m a r s h a l e r s \ v 4 . 0 _ 4 . 0 . 0 . 0 _ _ b 0 3 f 5 f 7 f 1 1 d 5 0 a 3 a " f i l e s p e c = " c u s t o m m a r s h a l e r s . d l l " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ a s s e m b l y \ g a c _ m s i l \ s y s t e m . w e b . a b s t r a c t i o n s \ v 4 . 0 _ 4 . 0 . 0 . 0 _ _ 3 1 b f 3 8 5 6 a d 3 6 4 e 3 5 " f i l e s p e c = " s y s t e m . w e b . a b s t r a c t i o n s . d l l " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ f r a m e w o r k 6 4 \ v 2 . 0 . 5 0 7 2 7 \ c o n f i g " f i l e s p e c = " w e b _ I o w t r u s t . c o n f i g " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ f r a m e w o r k 6 4 \ v 3 . 5 " f i l e s p e c = " e d m g e n . e x e " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ f r a m e w o r k 6 4 \ v 4 . 0 . 3 0 3 1 9 \ a s p . n e t w e b a d m i n f i l e s \ a p p c o n f i g " f i l e s p e c = " a p p s e t t i n g . a s c x " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ m i c r o s o f t . n e t \ f r a m e w o r k 6 4 \ v 4 . 0 . 3 0 3 1 9 \ s e t u p c a c h e \ e x t e n d e d " f i l e s p e c = " s e t u p u i . d l l " f i l e s p e c B a c k u p T y p e = " 3 8 5 5 " / F I L E _ L I S T p a t h = " c : \ w i n d o w s \ s y s t e m 3 2 " f i l e s p e c = " a p i -

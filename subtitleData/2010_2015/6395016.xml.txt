JUST LEAVE THE BABY . " I HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT . AND THE MEN PUT DOWN THEIR KNIVES . YOU PROBABLY GUESSED WHO THAT OLD MAN WAS . THAT BABY WAS EDGAR . AND I WAS THE MAN WITH THE KNIFE . I KILLED EDGAR 'S MOTHER . AND THEN ONE BY ONE , OTHER PEOPLE IN THE TAIL SECTION STARTED ... CUTTING ARMS AND LEGS AND OFFERING THEM . IT WAS LIKE A MIRACLE . AND I WANTED TO ... I TRIED . I JUST ... A MONTH LATER , WILFORD 'S SOLDIERS BROUGHT THOSE PROTEIN BLOCKS . WE 'VE BEEN EATING THAT SHIT EVER SINCE . 18 YEARS I 'VE HATED WILFORD . 18 YEARS I 'VE WAITED FOR THIS MOMENT . AND NOW I 'M HERE . OPEN THE GATE . PLEASE . YOUR STORY IS SO BEAUTIFUL , CURTIS . BUT I DON 'T WANT TO OPEN THIS DOOR . YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT ? I WANT TO OPEN A DOOR . BUT NOT THIS ONE . THAT ONE . THAT ONE THAT LEADS TO THE OUTSIDE . WE 'VE BEEN SENTENCED HERE FOR 18 YEARS . EVERYONE THINKS IT 'S A WALL . BUT IT 'S A FUCKING DOOR . OPEN IT AND GET US OUT OF HERE . AND FREEZE TO DEATH ? WHAT ARE YOU , FUCKING CRAZY ? I KNOW ... BUT MAYBE WE CAN SURVIVE . YOU REMEMBER YEKATERINA BRIDGE ? WHEN WE GOT SLAUGHTERED WITH AXES ? EVERY NEW YEAR , I CHECK SOMETHING . WE SEE THE WRECKAGE OF A PLANE ... UNDER THE SNOW . FOR TEN YEARS THE TAIL COULD BARELY BE SEEN . BUT NOW I CAN SEE THE FUSELAGE AND WINGS . THERE IS LESS AND LESS SNOW AND ICE . IT MELTS . SNOW BECOMES MORE FRAGILE . IT DOESN 'T TAKE MUCH TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING . RECENTLY , YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW ? OUTSIDE , THERE WERE ... RAIN DROPS . I 'M WASTING MY BREATH TELLING YOU THIS . YOU GOTTA TAKE IT EASY ON THAT KRONOLE . THAT FLAMMABLE SHIT 'S GONNA FRY YOUR BRAIN . YOU DON 'T THINK I 'M RIGHT . KRONOLE IS HIGHLY COMBUSTIBLE . ONE SPARK , AND BOOM ! BASICALLY , IT 'S A FUCKING BOMB . I DON 'T HOARD THESE JUST TO GET HIGH ... BUT TO BLOW THAT GATE . MATCHES , QUICKLY . WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING ? GIVE IT TO ME ! TAKE THAT OFF THE DOOR . FIRE ! CURTIS EVERETT . I 'VE BEEN ASKED TO EXTEND A FORMAL INVITATION ... FROM MR. WILFORD TO JOIN HIM FOR DINNER . AFTER YOU . CURTIS ? IS THAT YOU ? CURTIS , DEAR BOY ... COME IN . LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOU . YOU HUNGRY ? YOU DID A MAN 'S WORK , COMING ALL THIS WAY . PLEASE , SIT DOWN . YOU ARE THE FIRST HUMAN BEING TO HAVE WALKED THE TOTAL LENGTH OF THIS TRAIN . TAIL TO ENGINE . DID YOU KNOW THAT ? WELL DONE . BRAVO . NONE OF YOUR PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN HERE , TO THE ENGINE . I 'VE NEVER BEEN TO THE TAIL SECTION . WHY NOT ? TOO DIRTY FOR YOU ? DON 'T WANT TO RUB AGAINST THE VERMIN OF THE TAIL SECTION ? DO YOU THINK MY STATION IS WITHOUT IT 'S OWN DRAWBACKS ? IT 'S NOISY . AND IT 'S LONELY . RIGHT . STEAKS . PLENTY OF ROOM . THIS WHORE TO BRING YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT . CURTIS , EVERYONE HAS THEIR PREORDAINED POSITION . AND EVERYONE IS IN THEIR PLACE EXCEPT YOU . THAT 'S WHAT PEOPLE IN THE BEST PLACE SAY TO THE PEOPLE IN THE WORST PLACE . THERE 'S NOT A SOUL ON THIS TRAIN THAT WOULDN 'T TRADE PLACES WITH YOU . WOULD YOU TRADE PLACES WITH ME ? FUCK YOU . CURTIS , DEAR BOY . THE FACT IS THAT WE ARE ALL STUCK INSIDE THIS BLASTED TRAIN . WE ARE ALL PRISONERS IN THIS HUNK OF METAL . MEDIUM RARE ? AND THIS TRAIN IS A CLOSED ECOSYSTEM . WE MUST ALWAYS STRIVE FOR BALANCE . AIR , WATER , FOOD SUPPLY , AND POPULATION ... MUST ALWAYS BE KEPT IN BALANCE . FOR OPTIMUM BALANCE , HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MORE ... RADICAL SOLUTIONS WERE REQUIRED . WHEN THE POPULATION NEEDED TO BE REDUCED , RATHER ... DRASTICALLY . WE DON 'T HAVE TIME FOR TRUE NATURAL SELECTION . WE WOULD ALL BE HIDEOUSLY OVERCROWDED AND STARVE WAITING FOR THAT . THE NEXT BEST SOLUTION ... IS TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL UNITS KILL OFF OTHER INDIVIDUAL UNITS . FROM TIME TO TIME , WE 'VE HAD TO STIR THE POT , SO TO SPEAK . THE REVOLT OF SEVEN , THE MCGREGOR RIOTS ... THE GREAT CURTIS REVOLUTION . A BLOCKBUSTER PRODUCTION WITH A DEVILISHLY UNPREDICTABLE PLOT . WHO COULD HAVE PREDICTED YOUR COUNTERATTACK WITH THE TORCH IN THE YAKETERINA TUNNEL ? PURE GENIUS . THAT WASN 'T WHAT GILLIAM AND I HAD IN OUR PLAN . WHAT ? WELL DON 'T TELL ME YOU DIDN 'T KNOW . GILLIAM AND I ... OUR PLAN . GILLIAM ? GILLIAM . THE FRONT AND THE TAIL ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK TOGETHER . HE WAS MORE THAN A PARTNER , REALLY . HE WAS MY FRIEND . BULLSHIT . I DON 'T BELIEVE YOU . OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WAS FOR THE INSURGENCY TO END AT THE YAKETERINA TUNNEL . AND ALL THE SURVIVORS WOULD GO BACK TO THE TAIL SECTION ... - TO ENJOY MUCH MORE SPACE . - YOU 'RE A FUCKING LIAR . GILLIAM WOULD NEVER DO THAT . IT ALL WORKED OUT IN THE END . YOUR COUNTERATTACK ACTUALLY MADE THE INSURGENCY 10 TIMES MORE EXCITING . UNFORTUNATELY THE FRONT SUFFERED MORE LOSSES THAN ANTICIPATED AND ... GILLIAM HAD TO PAY THE PRICE . IRONIC , ISN 'T IT ? HOW PEOPLE DRAMATICALLY CROSS THAT THIN BARRIER BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH . NOW THERE 'S JUST ONE LAST THING FOR US TO DO . TALLY UP THE NUMBERS . HELLO , WILFORD . IT 'S ME . I 'M AT GILLIAM 'S PLACE . HOLD ON . IS IT STILL THE SAME NUMBER ? YES . IT STILL STANDS AT 74 % . OKAY , CARRY ON . WAIT . SPARE 18 , TO CELEBRATE OUR 18TH YEAR . IT 'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA . YES . YOUR PEOPLE . GODDAMMIT CLAUDE ! MIND THE ENGINE ! SHE 'S GETTING SENSITIVE RECENTLY . SIT DOWN AND MIND YOUR TABLE MANNERS . JUST RELAX . CALM DOWN . NOW I CAN SEE WHAT GILLIAM MEANT . HE TOLD ME YOU WERE BRILLIANT AND CLEVER , BUT ALWAYS SO TENSE . WHEN 'S THE LAST TIME YOU GOT LAID ? LIKE GILLIAM SAID , HOLDING A WOMAN IS MUCH BETTER WITH TWO ARMS . I 'LL MISS GILLIAM . I 'LL MISS OUR LATE NIGHT PHONE CHATS . HE COULD GO ON FOR HOURS . ALL WITH ONLY ONE ARM . WHAT 'S WITH THAT FACE ? WHAT 'S THE MATTER ? YOU LOOK LIKE A CRAZY PERSON . AS IF THERE AREN 'T ENOUGH CRAZIES ON THIS TRAIN . BLOOD ! ARE YOU OKAY ? WHAT ? WHAT HAPPENED ? GET DOWN . YONA ... WE MUST OPEN THIS DOOR . YOU SEE THOSE CABLES ? THERE ARE SO MANY CABLES . DIE ! BASTARD ! I BELIEVE IT IS EASIER FOR SOMEONE TO SURVIVE ON THIS TRAIN ... IF THEY HAVE SOME LEVEL OF INSANITY . AND AS GILLIAM WELL UNDERSTOOD ... WE NEED TO MAINTAIN A PROPER BALANCE OF ANXIETY AND FEAR ... CHAOS AND HORROR IN ORDER TO KEEP LIFE GOING . AND IF WE DON 'T HAVE THAT , WE NEED TO INVENT IT . IN THAT SENSE , THE GREAT CURTIS REVOLUTION YOU INVENTED WAS TRULY A MASTERPIECE . YONA . RED , NUMBER 8 . NO , 7 . COME WITH ME , CURTIS . THERE 'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SHOW YOU . YOU DESERVE IT . COME ON . SHE 'S WAKING UP NOW . COZY , YES ? PEACEFUL . YOU ARE NOW IN HER HEART . I 'VE DEVOTED MY ENTIRE LIFE TO THIS . THE ETERNAL ENGINE . IT IS ETERNITY ITSELF . HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ALONE ON THIS TRAIN ? WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ALONE ? YOU CAN 'T REMEMBER , CAN YOU ? SO PLEASE DO . TAKE YOUR TIME . I JUST WROTE IT . IT 'S FOR YOU , CURTIS . HERE . I AM OLD . I WANT YOU TO TAKE MY STATION . IT 'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED . IT 'S WHAT GILLIAM WANTED TOO . YOU MUST TEND THE ENGINE ... KEEP HER HUMMING . LOOK , CURTIS . BEYOND THE GATE ... SECTION AFTER SECTION , PRECISELY WHERE THEY 'VE ALWAYS BEEN AND WHERE THEY 'LL ALWAYS BE . ALL ADDING UP TO WHAT ? THE TRAIN . AND NOW THE PERFECTLY CORRECT NUMBER OF HUMAN BEINGS ... ALL IN THEIR PROPER PLACES , ALL ADDING UP TO WHAT ? HUMANITY . THE TRAIN IS THE WORLD . WE THE HUMANITY . AND NOW YOU HAVE THE SACRED RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD ALL OF HUMANITY . WITHOUT YOU , CURTIS , HUMANITY WILL CEASE TO EXIST . YOU 'VE SEEN WHAT PEOPLE DO WITHOUT LEADERSHIP . THEY DEVOUR ONE ANOTHER . YONA , THE KRONOLE ! - YONA , STOP ! - NO . NO BULLETS ? STICK THE KRONOLE ON THE DOOR . LOOK AT THEM . THAT 'S HOW PEOPLE ARE . YOU KNOW . YOU 'VE SEEN THIS . YOU 'VE BEEN THIS . RIDICULOUS . PATHETIC , AREN 'T THEY ? YOU CAN SAVE THEM FROM THEMSELVES . THIS IS WHAT GILLIAM SAVED YOU FOR . CURTIS . THIS IS YOUR DESTINY . IT 'S DONE ! CURTIS HAS THE MATCHES . GO GET THEM ! CURTIS ! THE MATCHES ! THE SPACE ONLY ALLOWS FOR A VERY SMALL PERSON . YOUNG CHILDREN UNDER 5 . THE ENGINE LASTS FOREVER , BUT NOT SO ALL OF ITS PARTS . THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WENT EXTINCT RECENTLY . WE NEEDED A REPLACEMENT . THANK GOODNESS THE TAIL SECTION MANUFACTURES A STEADY SUPPLY OF KIDS . SO WE CAN KEEP GOING MANUALLY . YOU FUCKING BASTARD ! YONA ... TAKE THE FIRE . LIGHT THE FUSE ! MANUAL REACTOR SHUTING DOWN . OKAY ... PLEASE STAND AT SAFE DISTANCE . MANUAL REACTOR CHECK IN PROGRESS . ANDY ? IS THAT YOU ? ANDY ! DO YOU REMEMBER ME ? ANDY , STOP ! LISTEN TO ME . DON 'T GO UP THOSE STAIRS . LISTEN ! ANDY ! COME HERE . COME OVER HERE . ANDY , LISTEN TO ME ! GET OUT OF THERE ! GODDAMMIT , ANDY ! LISTEN TO ME . OH , CURTIS , DON 'T BE SO MELODRAMATIC . YOU KNOW EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PREORDAINED POSITION . NICE . DAD ... DAD ... DAD ! CURTIS ... STAY HERE . THE END SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS

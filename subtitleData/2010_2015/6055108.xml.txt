 NARRATOR : Two weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day , it tests our limits , Ripped By mstoll bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever . But we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Do you think this is where Lyle disappeared to ? It 's a tunnel . James , I expect you know that I 'm alive . Your mother told you to trust Lyle ? - You mean before she died ? - Two days ago , she sent me an e-mail . She 's alive . She 's out there somewhere . I saw that in my dream . I 've seen it too . It 's in my hometown , Zenith . That 's the same town that I 'm from . You keep saying you 're on my side , but it seems like you turned on me . You killed a 19-year-old girl that your nephew loved . I had to . Everything Pauline put in her journal has come true . It says in here that if those four kids die , the dome comes down . You 're not gonna touch those kids . Sam ! Hey . Bad dream ? Sam jumping off the cliff . You couldn 't stop him . It 's what he said before he jumped . That he admitted to killing Angie ? - He said a lot of things . - He 's crazy . I mean , he thought his dead sisters drawings of Angie and the hands were some kind of message . If he killed them , the dome would come down . You need to get some sleep . I don 't think I can . Well , in the morning , we 're gonna have to tell Junior and Joe . Oh . Good morning . Um ... I guess I fell asleep . - It 's okay . You were tired . - Aren 't you ? Knowing Lyle 's out there wanting to kill us kept me awake . You stayed up to keep us safe ? It wasn 't hard . Not with Joe snoring like an elephant in heat . MELANIE : Ha , ha . - I heard that . Did the egg do anything else last night ? Not since it showed us the obelisk from Zenith . Which is so weird . Why would it show us something from my hometown ? Well , your hometown is Barbie 's hometown . That has to mean something . [ CAR DOOR OPENS JUNIOR SHUSHES ] Someone 's coming . Whoa . Friendlies . Barbie . You made it out of the cave-in , and you 're all right . You found the egg . In the lake , where you said it would be . When we were all together , it floated to the surface . Like it needed to be with us . - You have to keep it safe . - I will . - We have to talk about Sam . - Why ? Is my uncle okay ? He 's dead , Junior . What ? What happened ? Yesterday when you went into the tunnels with Sam to find Lyle , it was because we thought Lyle killed Angie , except he didn 't . Sam did . No , you 're lying . I saw the scratches that she left on him . And once I knew , he jumped off of a cliff at the end of the tunnel . No . No , that 's not true . - I 'm sorry , Junior . - I 'm just supposed to believe you ? You don 't know my uncle . You going after him too ? No . We need to get Sam 's body . The only real evidence we have are those scratches that Angie left on him . And until Junior and the whole town sees that , we 're not gonna put this behind us . JIM : Looks like you lived to see another day . Jim . You gonna tell me what you 're doing , or you 're gonna keep me guessing ? Come on , Barbie . You know I 'm gonna find out one way or another . Look , the whole reason I got into trouble in the first place yesterday is that I wasn 't fully equipped to explore the tunnels . Figured I 'd go back , do it right , I 'd see what I see . You gonna tell me what you find ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , you 'll be the first to know . JULIA : Where did it go ? - It disappears in the darkness . It 's the same thing that happened to Sam . I didn 't hear it land . How is that possible ? Same way the dome 's possible . Got any ideas to help us understand where that cliff might lead to ? REBECCA : No , I don 't understand it . This laser pointer never reaches the far side , and even stranger , my compass is spinning . It says we 're facing every direction at once . I don 't like this . Me neither , but you saw Junior 's reaction . He 's not gonna believe that Sam killed Angie till he sees that body himself . Scratches and all . - Promise me you 'll be careful . - Of course I will . All right . Be right back . What do you see ? I see a whole lot of dark . Describe the rockface . Any vegetation ? BARBIE : Nope . It 's dead as a doornail . I 've gotta be 20 feet down by now . Can you see the bottom ? BARBIE : No . But the darkness , I think I 'm getting closer to it . [ BARBIE YELLS ] Whoa , whoa ! Hey ! You guys messing with the rope ? No , we didn 't touch it . Okay , well , something just pulled me . Barbie , come up . [ YELLS ] Oh , my God . The anchor 's coming loose . Barbie ! [ BARBIE YELLS JULIA GRUNTS ] - Julia , hold on . - Hey ! Barbie ! [ ALL GRUNTING ] - Rebecca ! REBECCA : Yes , I am trying . JULIA : Rebecca ! Barbie , I 've got the rope ! You need to climb ! Julia , let go ! Julia ! Julia , let go of the rope ! - The hell I will . - Julia , I can 't hold it . If we don 't let go , we 'll go over too . Julia ! Barbie , don 't you dare . I got you . - I love you , Julia . - I can pull you up . No ! Barbie , can you hear me ? Barbie , say something ! - Julia ... - Barbie ? Julia . Barbie , say something , damn you ! Barbie ! - Come on . Come on . - Say something ! [ JULIA SOBBING ] - Do you think he did it ? - Sam ? You knew my uncle back when you were alive before . Do you think he 's capable of murder ? The Sam I used to know was sweet and kind and always smiling . But now I don 't know . There 's something so much darker in him . What do you think ? I trusted him . How could my own uncle murder Angie ? Did I hear you right ? Sam murdered Angie ? Who told you this ? Barbie . He found out when they were down in the tunnels , and then Sam killed himself . So Barbie told you . I 'm sorry , son . Are you ? I 'll be downstairs . I know this is tough to hear , son . But your uncle was always ... He was off . It 's why we didn 't get along . The truth is , he was never as strong as you and I. And this town needs strength . It needs us . Right now I don 't care what the town needs . Well , you need to . Now more than ever . We 're special , Junior . The dome chose me , and you 're my son . No , no , no . I 'm not- - I 'm done listening to this . Junior , Junior . Junior , please listen to me . Why do you always have to make everything about you ? JOE : Angie loved this . I know . She 's never coming back . And you 're at peace with it ? I 'll never be at peace with it . But I have to accept it . You 're staring into that thing like it 's a crystal ball or something . It 's got me thinking about the dome . Something isn 't adding up . Does anything add up anymore ? There was never a tunnel down there . Now there is . What 's your point , Joe ? My point is , where did it come from ? Why is it here ? - We should go back in there . - I am sorry , okay ? But we called for him . There wasn 't any answer . There 's just no way he could survive a fall like that . Okay , come on . Why don 't you lie down , huh ? There 's a couch in my shop room . Rebecca , no one can know . What ? Just until I can tell them . I just need to figure it out first . You 're worried about Big Jim . Without Barbie , there 's no telling what he 'll do . I 'll follow your lead , okay ? Now come On . [ DOOR CLOSES ] JIM : There you are . Why didn 't you tell me ? Tell you what ? About Sam . I had to hear it from Junior . He was devastated . What do you want , Jim ? Well , I wanna talk to Barbie . Where is he ? - He 's- - - Bringing up Sam 's body . - Well , I 'll give him a hand . - Um , the tunnel 's not safe . - Could collapse at any moment . - Rebecca made me come up too . What 's wrong , Julia ? Are you upset ? No . No , it 's just the dust . Like she said , it 's bad down there . And only Barbie is equipped to get through it . JULIA : He , uh , wanted to ask if maybe you would go down to the police station . In case any calls came in . Of course . Anything I can do to be of service . [ CHILDREN CHATTERING AND LAUGHING ] [ DOGS BARKING ] [ GASPS ] [ GASPS ] [ GROANS ] WOMAN : Fantastic . Good , okay . Got it ? Ready ? [ CROWD CHATTERING ] WOMAN : Whoa . [ woman sass ] Can I help you ? - I 'm looking for Pauline Verdreaux . - And you are ? Her brother . Sam Verdreaux . - I 'll get someone to take you up . - Take me up ? Your sister is in the locked ward . Yes . I need an escort . Barbie 's gone ? Does that mean he 's dead ? Oh , my God . What happened ? - He cut the rope on purpose . - But why ? To save Rebecca and me from going over the cliff . I don 't believe it , Julia . The dome wouldn 't let anything happen to Barbie . It went crazy when Big Jim tried to hang him , right ? And now a tunnel appears that wasn 't here three weeks ago ? What do you mean , it wasn 't there three weeks ago ? I 've lived in Chester 's Mill my entire life . The basement underneath the school has always just been a basement . And then a tunnel appears ? What if the dome dug it ? And that tunnel and that cliff and Barbie going down there was all part of the dome 's plan ? A plan for what ? I don 't know . But we can find out . If we go over that cliff ourselves . - I would never let you do that . - I don 't mean us . Then what do you mean ? I was president of the school Robotics Club , and we made stuff that might help us find exactly whats at the bottom of that cliff . Okay . Okay , meet me at the locker in a half hour . I 'll be right back . [ ALARM RINGING ] Has my sister been here long ? Place like this , time don 't exactly mean much . She 's in there . - Thanks . ORDERLY : Yeah . Let me remind you teo that this is your vision . This is the- - Oh , my God . Sam . Hi , sis . Oh . But you were inside the dome . - Did it come down ? - No . How did you get out ? I 'm still trying to figure that out myself . And Junior ? Did he get out ? ls he all right ? He 's still in Chester 's Mill . He knows you 're alive . He got your message . Oh , we have so much to talk about . JIM : Don 't bother with that . - Ah ! You know how nosy neighbors can be . And what we have to discuss is no ones business but our own . Jim , what are you doing in here ? You know , I ... I blame myself in part for this . I trusted you . - I never should 've . - What are you talking about ? You made a huge mistake crossing me . Did I never mention that the dome saved me from death at those gallows ? It redeemed me . It chose me to do what it wants . And yet you couldn 't see that , could you ? Otherwise , you wouldn 't have lied to me . - I didn 't lie to you . - Yes , you did . [ GASPS ] Jim , you 're scaring me . Well , maybe you should be scared . I don 't know what you 're talking about . I waited outside that school . I saw you leave , but Barbie ? He never left . So where is he ? And do not lie to me again . Ever . Barbie ... Barbie 's dead . [ SIGHS ] Welcome home , Barbie . RICK : Been worried about you , Barbie . We 've been staking out your apartment . Where you been hiding the last three weeks ? Rick . You promised you were gonna go run a few errands for Maxine , then be back to do a job for me . Got sidetracked . You knew what we were gonna clear for that info on Aktaion Energy 's R D. It would 've made us all rich . Well , you , anyway . But then you just up and vanished . Would you believe me if I told you I was stuck under the dome ? [ THUGS CHUCKLE ] [ BARBIE GRUNTING ] You 're gonna go do the Aktaion job you said you would . - At half the price . - And if I say no ? [ BARBIE GRUNTING ] You won 't have enough teeth to form the word . No ! Okay ! Okay . Just give me a day to get organized , all right ? I just got back . You 'll go now . I still can 't believe you got out . - That makes two of us . - How ? We found these tunnels underneath the school . At the end of them there was a cliff . And I went over . - You jumped on purpose ? - No . It was dark . I fell . Anyway , all that matters is that I 'm here . I found you . How come you didn 't tell me that you were gonna fake your own death ? Don 't you trust me ? Of course I trust you . I didn 't tell you because I don 't trust myself . I don 't understand . I knew the dome was coming down , even if Big Jim said I was crazy . But you 're not crazy . - The dome did come down . - Yeah . And I just thought if I left Chester 's Mill that the dome would follow me . And I was afraid to tell you about my plan because then you 'd prevent me from leaving . Right . - I 'm sorry I ever doubted you . - Any sane person would . Guess it 's no shock Lyle believed me . Is that why you asked him for help ? I sent him postcards over the years . I know it was wrong to use him that way , but I needed to stay in contact with someone , and I knew he wouldn 't tell anyone . I did all this to save the town . You , my son ... And I was wrong , and now James is stuck in there . I guess anything is possible if you and Lyle could get out . What ? Have you seen Lyle ? Yes , I 've seen him . He 's here . - How about now ? JULIA : Hold on one sec . You see anything ? JULIA : Yeah , we 've got picture , and it 's recording . In just a second , it 'll be showing us whatever 's at the bottom of that cliff . Julia , are you sure you wanna look ? I wanna see whatever 's down there . - No matter what . - Here we go . [ ROBOT WHIRRING ] It 's just passing 20 feet . Looks like just rocks . Nothing else . - Hey , we 're losing picture . - We shouldn 't be . - Joe , what 's happening ? - I don 't know . - Better pull it back , Joe . Pull it back . - I 'm trying . It won 't come back up . - You said you knew how to fly it . - I do . Damn it . We 've lost the signal . I 'm sorry , Julia . It 's my own fault . When you guys started talking about tunnels , I just really wanted to- - I really wanted to believe there was a chance . We all did . Um , guys ? You need to see this . I thought I saw something in that last bright flash and rewound the video . And it was a bright flash . So what ? Unless you see it frame by frame . Right there . - That looks like a slide . - No , I think it 's a playground . - Where ? - I don 't know . Oh , my God . The obelisk . This is really the place ? The owner of Aktaion Energy lives here , so shut your mouth and watch our 6 . [ ALARM BLARING ] What the hell ? You double-crossing son of a bitch . - Put down your weapon . - Hey , hey . Easy , easy . All right ? I can explain all this . Dale ? Is that you ? Oh , my God , it is you . Hi , Dad . Drink ? - I 'll have a beer if you got one . - Hmm . How long 's it been ? - Two years ? - Two and a half . Either way , entirely too long . - Please , sit . - No . I 'll stand . [ CHUCKLES ] Is it weird that I 've missed your stubbornness ? Reminds me of your mother . I 'm happy to hear I remind anyone of her . So you 're gonna tell me why you hit the panic code and then took down the man that you were with ? It doesn 't matter . He 's in cuffs . I don 't suppose you 're gonna tell me how you got those wounds either . I assume that you haven 't come here to patch things up . You want something from me . A favor . LYLE : Melanie . - Melanie . - That 's all he says , over and over again . The police found him in the middle of town looking at the obelisk . LYLE : Melanie . - And they brought him here . Melanie . - Melanie . - Lyle ? Melanie . Melanie . Lyle , can you hear me ? - Lyle ? - Melanie ! He didn 't recognize me either . That 's all he does . Eat , sleep and say " Melanie . " And no one knows he was inside the dome ? LYLE : Melanie . No one even knows his name . He didn 't have a wallet . Something must have happened to him when he went off that cliff . - But you 're okay . - That 's true . LYLE : Melanie ? Melanie . There 's only one Melanie that I can think of he would be talking about . There 's no way he 's talking about her , right ? Our Melanie ? It was so long ago . There 's something you should knew . Melanie 's alive . She came back from the dead . I need you to get me into the dome . You want me to get you to the dome ? I need to get a message to somebody on the inside . - Who ? - It doesn 't matter . Obviously it does , or you wouldn 't be here . Dad , trust me . I wouldn 't be asking you this if it wasn 't important . Dale , the dome coming down is arguably the most significant event in history . The whole world is watching . The National Guard has established a ten-mile no-go zone around the perimeter . And the other half of that is a bombed-out wasteland . Yeah , but you 've pulled strings before . But not like this . I can 't go to my friends in D.C. I mean , it 's just not gonna work out . They 're gonna think that I 'm a fool . So this is about business ? - Don 't start . - No , you have not changed a damn bit . Everything I 've done in business has been for our family . But you could never have seen that . If you did , you wouldn 't have run off and joined the army . I wouldn 't have had to pull strings to bring you home from your deployment early . - I never asked you to do that . - No . But your mother did . You think it was a coincidence that she got sick right after you came home ? She knew she was running out of time . She just wanted to say goodbye . Dad , I have never asked you for anything . But I 'm asking you now . Please help me get to the dome . Joe ? Norrie ? They 've gotta be here . We 've looked everywhere else . Julia ? Anyone ? I don 't like being here . Me neither . JOE : Hey ! JUNIOR : Joe ? - Where are you ? JOE : I 'm down here ! You scared the hell out of us . MELANIE : We heard about Barbie . - Is it true ? - Yeah , but it 's all complicated . - Is Julia down there ? - Yeah , she 's down here . - She okay ? - Yeah . Do you have the egg with you ? - Right here . - Okay , perfect timing . Come on . We have to show you guys something . Let 's go . Come on . [ CROWD MURMURING ] What are you doing ? We 're having a memorial for Barbie . Shouldn 't Julia be here ? No one can find her . And I didn 't wanna wait , given Barbie 's importance to this town . I 'm sad that he 's gone . I know at times we may have been enemies , but often he was the only thing standing between this town and disaster . It 's a real loss for everyone . Now it 's time for all of us to come together . Around you . I think it 's time for a prayer . All right , folks . Let 's gather round . And bow your heads . O heavenly Father , you 've gotten us through dark times before , and we pray that you will get us through this one . I 'm glad you 've decided to stay , Dale . Well , it 's just for a night . - I guess I owe you the truth . - About ? About why I wanna get to the dome . I 'm gonna go out on a limb . There 's a woman inside . The second that I saw you , I knew you weren 't the same man that I knew two and a half years ago . You 've changed , Dale . The way you hold yourself , the look in your eyes . That edge you had from Iraq is gone . And I know there 's only one thing that can do that . What 's her name ? Julia . - Do you love her ? - Yeah , I love her . You understand that we risk everything ? - I do . - And you 're willing to take that risk ? Yeah , I am . All right . I 'll help you get to the dome . Really ? I understand what it feels like to be separated from the woman you love . Thank you , Dad . MELANIE : Julia . You really think Joe 's onto something ? I don 't know , but I hope so . [ EGG WHIRRING ] - The egg . NORRIE : It 's glowing again . JUNIOR : What 's happening ? What is this ? MELANIE : It 's Zenith . - That 's where the obelisk is . Does that mean ... ? There could be a way out of the dome . JULIA : Not just that . Barbie could be alive . If he found a way out , maybe he 'll find a way back . [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] Ripped By mstoll

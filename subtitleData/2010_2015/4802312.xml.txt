 Subtitle by Norel Compile Resync by Jawier Dear dad , Your last letter , you questioned whether it 's my responsibility to join this fight . The truth is we all became responsible the day we created the cylons . We 're the ones who let these robots become our servants , our trusted helpers , and even our friends . We let them into our lives only to see them repay our trust with a violent revolt against us . I know there is a lot of debate about why they hate us . But in the end , Does it really matter ? Kill the enemy or be killed . That 's the reality . In a war where mankind 's very survival hangs in the balance , it 's up to each of us to make a difference . Being a pilot is the best way I know how to do that . Your loving son , William Adama . Hold still , you toaster bastard . Watch out , Hot shot . You 've got a bandit on your six . That 's fine , just adds to the challenge . Come on , Kid . Break off ! Break off ! No way , I got this . Come on , come on , come on . Frak , I can 't ... I can 't see ! You 've got no visibility , Kid . Get out of there . Watch you back , Kid . It 's coming around again . There we go . Much better . What , are you crazy ? Return to base ! You can 't take that kind of radiation exposure . You 'd die in less than 30 sec . 20 seconds and counting ! You 're approaching radiation exposure max . Frak , my gun is jammed ! - You only have 12 sec left ! - Frak that ! Okay . Game over . Are you crazy , you can 't fire ... Deal with it , suckers ! Come on , tell me that ain 't no record . Congratulation captain , You have completed level six . Good sim score ? Oh , no . Not a good sim score . The top sim score . - I 'm impressed . - Thanks . I 'd be if I were you . Lookout Jay , we 've got a live one . Let me guess . You 're freshly out of Academy , and you 've been itching to fly a Viper since you were in short pants but your only worry now is that the war will be over before you get the chance to prove what a bona fide ace you are . Congratulations , you got me pegged . Except for the worrying part . I don 't do that . Look at the pair on you . Was that a request ? No don 't get your hopes up , rooky . - You 're not my type . - No ? Good so it 's a date . Town boy ! - You are a real charger , ain 't you ? - Thank you . If you 're looking for some action , there 's a girl who 's gonna give it to you . Gods damn ... - Yo rook , you 're blocking traffic . - I 'm sorry . That 's Deke Tornvald . The " Minute Man . " - You heard of him , huh ? - Heard of him ? He was like my hero at the Academy . What 's he got , like 30 kills ? You 'd better hurry or there won 't be any left for you , ace . Look out ! Back just in time . Suit up ! Briefing in 30 . - Another snowball patrol , sir ? - Yeah . What 's this , fresh meat ? Ensign William Adama , reporting for flight duty , sir . If there 's a mission , I 'd like to be part of it . Good . Papers . At ease . You 're F.O.B. , Ensign . Sure you don 't want to find your rack first ? Respectfully , sir , I signed on to kill toasters , not take naps . Just point me at my plane and I 'll get started . All right , Ensign , I 'm assigning you to the Weasel . She 's right over there . She 's beautiful , sir . Not the Viper rook . The bird behind her . That old flying pillbox , sir ? It 's a Raptor . That 's a designation you 're qualified . No sir , there has to be - some kind of mistake . - Respectfully . Respectfully , sir , there is a mistake ! I did not rate top of my class so I could drive a bus . - I 'm a Viper pilot . - Congratulations ! I 'll break it down for you like this , the brass makes it seem like Operation Clean Sweep lived up with it 's name , but somebody forgot to give the toasters that memo . They 're taking down our planes right and left . And right now , I need Raptor drivers more than I need Viper jocks . So make sure your " bus " is ready for action . - Is that clear ? - Yes , sir . Good . Dismissed . - I 'm so sorry . - Frak ! I 'm sorry . I just finished mucking this all thing out . I 'm sorry , I didn 't see what was going on . Of course you didn 't , because you weren 't looking ! What are you doing in here ? Are you with that godsdamn press tour ? No ... Um ... I 'm William Adama . I was just assigned to fly this bird . - So I came to get acquainted . - You ? - You 're my new driver ? - Yeah ? They send me a rook fresh of the boat ? Great . Guess you must be my new Copilot . Not if I can do something about it , I 'm not . I want new gyros on there this time . - Or I 'll be pissed off ! - I 'm working on it , Lieutenant . Let me help you with all this . Just leave ... just leave it ! I said leave it alone . Fasio ... Fasiovik . Oh Frak . You gotta call me something , call me Coker . Just don 't get too familiar with it . Okay . So ... Coker , who was your last pilot ? I 'm just mopping of what 's left of him . Frakking knuckle-draggers . Poor bastard . Who the frak signs up for a third tour ? Hey look , I 'm sorry about your friend ... He wasn 't my frakking friend ! He was an asshole . And he was worth ten huskers like you ! Lieutenant Fasjovik and Captain Adama , please report to the CO . Briefing call . Here we go again . Just listen real good and try not to get us killed , okay , rook ? And you better clean up ! And stick with your barn yard tractor pulls . I 'm from Caprica city . Yeah tell that to someone who cares , husker . You 're gonna offer the commander a drink ? What ? Flask . Frak . Let 's go ! - Sir . - Mister Fasjovik . Forty-seven days left in your mandatory second tour . Planning on re-upping ? Not if I get a say in it , sir . Hard to part with an experienced officer , but that 's your call . - Clean up that image . - Yes , sir . Ensign William Adama . Caprican but with some interesting Tauron family connections . The Ha 'la 'tha ? I can 't see that my family has anything to do with this mission , sir . Relax , son . I 'd never judge a man on his father 's sins or merits . Your grades at the Academy weren 't exactly stellar but your flight instructor says you 're a " natural . " I quote : " One of the best pilot candidates I have ever seen . And unfortunately he knows it . " You 're a cocky son of a bitch , aren 't you , Ensign ? Yes , you are . So is this an accurate assessment , son ? Are you a natural ? I can fly a plane , sir . A " natural , " I can 't say . - Is that mine , Mister Singh ? - Yes , sir . Thank you . We 're ten years into a bad war , son , so now this is how I handle cocky sons of bitches on my ship . I assign ' em to milk runs until they cool down . Your orders . - Something funny , Mister Fasjovik ? - Not at all , sir . You boys are gonna take some cargo to the Scorpion shipyards and you 're going to return with spare parts . It 's a four-day round trip . I 'd assign a jump-capable ship if I could afford one , but I can 't , so your sorry-ass Raptor will have to do . Above all , you 're to avoid any enemy contact . That includes Cylon ships , SAMS , slingshots , or anything else they might happen to have floating around out there . - Understood ? - Yes , sir . Gentlemen , do not frak this up . Come on , milk run . I said I didn 't want to drive a bus , now he 's gonna me driving a frakking delivery truck . Oh yeah , the only thing better is if they could make it a regular trip , say for the next , I don 't know , month or so . - You 're really getting out ? - Like a shot , kid . Go back to what , huh ? Where ? Who cares ? As long as it 's far away from here . Excuse me , Captain ? Captain Tornvald ? Sir ? Sir , I just wanted to say I 've been following your record since you first joined the Squadron . Someday I hope to be half the pilot you are . - I 'll let you in on a little secret , kid . - Yeah . It 's bullshit . All of it . Awesome . And then , I think he 's gonna bust us down and he says : You know what I do ? I 'm gonna send you on a godamn milk run . That 's it . We 're going out . It 's gonna be two days out , two days back . - So are you gonna lay over ? - Hell yeah I 'm gonna lay over . They got real booze over there . None of this watered-down pruno . It sounds like you two have booked a bona fide pleasure cruise . Yeah , you tell that to the young , dumb and itching to get his ass shot off over there he 's still crying his eyes out . What do you expect , Coker ? Our young thegn just wants to make a name for himself . Isn 't it why we 're here ? Huh ? Kill the enemy ? Destroy the frakking machines before they destroy us . Hurrah . Kid , we all know why we 're here . Jusy don 't be in such a rush , okay ? I think that 's my towel . See anything you like , rook ? - Hydraulic reservoir ? - Full . Cap secure . Front dradis antenna ? Almost . So ? Ha 'la 'tha ? My dad 's a lawyer . - Yeah ? Mob lawyer ? - Defense attorney . - What 's it to you ? - I 'm just saying . That could have rangled a pass on this old frak ass is pretty easy . Is that what you would have done ? Find a way out of the war ? All I 'm saying , Husker , is nobody gave me a choice . What the hell is this ? Your ordnance package . What 's it look like ? Well , it looks a little light to me . I see a full set of com drones , missile decoys , - and what , 2 Archers ? - We 're short on air-to-airs . Ordnance Chief says two , so two is what you get . You got a problem , take it up with him . Yeah , I 'll take it up with him . I 'm more concerned with our cargo . Can you at least get an exact weight ? Why don 't you ask it yourself . Uh , Theo , she 's our cargo ? - Hey , uhm .. - Hi . - We already met . Right ? In the ... - I ... - In the shower . - The shower . You 're a pilot ? Civilian . I 'm a software engineer . I 'm Bill Adama . The pilot . It 's nice to meet you . Welcome aboard , anyway . Like I said I 'm Bill Adama , your pilot . This is my co-pilot and ECO , lieutenant ... Fasjo ... Coker . Coker is fine . You look kinda young for a pilot , are you any good ? - So they tell me . - You believe everything they tell you ? Why don 't we get going ? Assuming this piece of shit can actually fly . Raptor 9-0-9 you 're clear for departure . Good afternoon , this is your captain Bill Adama . Our flight time to Scorpion is approximately two days , during which we hope to encounter absolutely nothing . Fortunately , you 'll find a wide range of fine Holoband entertainments to help you pass the time . For now , please remain seated with your seatbelt securely fastened and thank you once again for flying Wild Weasel airlines . - Like that huh ? - Lovely . You 're wasting your charms , such as they are . - I know her type . - Yeah ? What type is that ? As far as she 's concerned , we 're just the hired help . Oh hello . Are we still in Dradis range of Galactica ? - Uh no . - No . Good . If you 'll open this , you 'll find a new set of orders . Give me that . - What the hell is this ? - Open it and you 'll find out . These are from the Admiralty . As you can see , it specifies a new set of coordinates ... for a rendezvous with the heavy cruiser Archeron . Nononononono , that is two days in the wrong direction . That is sector 12 . That is right on the edge of Cylon controlled space . There 's no way we 're gonna make it out there alive . No , no there is no frakking way this is right . - I 'm calling Galactica . - No , you 're not . Excuse me ? The orders specify wireless silence . That means no contact with Galactica or any other Colonial ship or outpost . It also states that you are both to follow my orders . So , let 's get started . We have a lot of space to cover . - What are you grinning at ? - " Milk run . " Milk run , my ass . Dammit ! You 're having trouble with your band ? Yeah . Let me have a look . Well , you know how ... You know how to fix them ? I used to work for the company that designed them . You worked for Graystone Industries ? I worked on Cylons . I designed the upgrade on their MCP chip . - That 's their brain ... - Their brain , I know . So in other words , you helped improve the machines that are killing us . Hey . Better get up here . We 're approaching the rendezvous coordinates . Husker ! - Dradis ? - Clear . Here we go . Colonial transponder . Good . Hold on . - I 'm reading multiple signatures . - Maybe Archeron have support ships . Then , where the hell are their transponders ? - Something wrong with this picture . - Break radio silence and hail them . Archeron , this is Raptor 9-0-9 . Acknowledge and respond . Try again . Archeron , this is Raptor 9-0-9 . Acknowledge and respond . Gods ! Is that Archeron ? Got your answer ? Get back there and sit down , strap yourself in . Now ! This is unbelievable . Must 've been an ambush . Nobody could have survived this . I got three enemy contact . Incoming . I got one Raider inbound on our starboard side . - Visual . Where are the other two ? - I don 't know . Targeting . Dammit . Auto-targeting isn 't responding . I can 't get a lock . Can you get the helmets please ? Switch to manual . - Switching to manual . - You don 't understand . We are not to engage the enemy ! The godsdamn enemy engaged us . We can 't outrun ' em with this bird ! Thank you . Come on ! Visual , we 've got our second bandit incoming . Straight ahead . We 're locked on ! Firing ! Where 's that third Raider ? Visual , 3 o 'clock . Fire ! What 's going on ? - We 're fracked up ! - What happened ? It 's all good , we 're all right . Tow bandits , no missiles . Now I really don 't like the math . - Where the frak are you going ? - Can 't stay out in open space . I thought we couldn 't outrun them ? - We can 't . - Maybe I can slow them down . - The frakked thing is jammed ! - Let 's go to plan B ! There 's a plan B ? The fuselage is still largely intact , there is a good chance the jump drive will be too . What the hell are you talking about ? We 're gonna thread the needle . Let 's see if the Toasters can file on . - One , two , three ... - Husker ? - Are you counting ? - One , two ... - One , two , three ... - No Husker ! - One , two , three ... - No ! No , no ! Don 't try it ! - No ! Husker , no ! - One , two , three ... You 're not gonna make it ! This is what we do ! Not bad , Husker . Stupid , but not bad . Let 's get our asses home . No arguments there . You okay ? - I 'm all right . - Good . Don 't worry , we 'll get you back to Galactica safe and sound , all right ? We can 't go back . Not yet , anyway . I 'm sorry , what ? I need you to send a simple hail on that frequency . Pretty , our orders were to get you here , and that job is done . Your orders are to do as I say so long as I 'm aboard this ship . They are . All right , they are . Send the message . Sure ... Let 's just let every Toaster ship in the sector know exactly where we are . Clever , I like it . What the frak ? We got a response already ? It 's like someone was camped out on that frequency , waiting . Someone was . What 's the message ? They 're coordinates . And these are in Cylon space . Then that 's where we 're going . - No , it 's not where we 're going . - Yes it is . - No , it 's not where we 're going . - Yes , it is . - I 'm going home . - No . - If you guys want to come with me , - Coker . - That 's great . - Listen to me , all right . - I 'll take you . I 'll give you a ride . - Lieutenant . - There is enough food back there for you . - Listen to me . What ? ! Two months left on you tour , all right . You 're coming with us . You want to spend the rest of your life in prison , huh ? 'Cause you 're gonna get a court martial like that . Do you really think you can talk to me in my ... Coker ! I 'm am the pilot of this ship ! You are a copilot ! Let me know when we 're close . I 'm starting to like her as much as I like you . Good . Is that it ? Coordinates are on the far side of that big rock . - Still nothing on Dradis ? - No . With all this radiation , Dradis ain 't worth a damn . You could hide a fleet of Base Stars in this system . You better go wake up her holiness . Dr. Kelly ? Dr. Kelly ? Becca , wake up . Ezra ... Ezra ... It 's you . You were talking in your sleep . - What did I say ? - Nothing . You called me Ezra . Look , you don 't have to explain who he is , if you don 't want . - You 've heard of Ezra Barzel ? - Of course I have . Old Marine , took out like an entire Cylon platoon single-handed . A lot of the guys joined up at the Academy because of him . It 's an inspiring story . He was an inspiring man ... and a good husband . I hope you had a nice snooze . We 're about to find out what kind of funny games you got us into this time . Approaching coordinates . Dradis contact . Multiple readings . It is a fleet . Colonial transponder . It 's one of ours . There you go ! All right . And , it looks like they 're sending a greeting party . Hello , people ! They 're coming in hot ! Weapons locked on . Unidentified Raptor , answer password challenge " Spigot . " What the frak ? I don 't know . This is Raptor Niner-zero-niner , attached to the Battlestar Galactica . We do not know of any password . We 're here on a special mission . Repeat , challenge is " Spigot . " You have five seconds to respond or we 'll open fire . 5 sec to respond . - Has anyone tell you any passwords ? - No . Did you get anty password ? Three ... - Did you read the order ? - I skimmed it . - I don 't know . - Coker we need that password . - I 'll think of something , all right . - They 're engaging us . They 'll open fire any minute . We 're from Galactica ! Arrow ! Response is " Arrow " ! " Affirmative . Niner-zero-niner , follow me to the outer marker , then contact the LSO on frequency 134 for landing instructions . Roger that . You might have told us that bit of business before we almost got our asses shot off ? Everything I tell you has to be on a need-to-know basis . That 's the order . Frak . You see that Battlestar ? Wait , is that Valkyrie ? - I don 't know . - It is . - It 's Valkyrie ! - That 's not possible . Valkyrie was destroyed at Canceron Prime . No . It was reported destroyed . You see that heavy cruiser over there ? That 's the Loki . She was reported lost . Presumed destroyed , too . It 's a fleet of ghost ships hiding out in Cylon space . Get the Admiral on the horn tell him I 'm coming aboard to brief him on a Priority 1 mission . Fit ourselves out for a 12-league Jump , and tell him we 're gonna need ten of his new Mark Threes loaded for bear and prepped for an atmospheric insertion . Oh , and detail a Raptor for Dr. Kelly here . Commander . - Commander on deck . - Ensign William Adama . - As you were . - Squadron VA - 42 , Galactica . We brought Dr. Kelly here and I 'd like to volunteer our bird for this mission . - How long you been flying , Junior ? - This is my first op , Sir . But my ECO and I have already taken out two Cylon SAMS and three Raiders . Three bandits ? In a Raptor ? That true ? It 's true enough . Thanks , son , but I think we 'll go ahead one of our own birds on this one . Commander ! Commander , these men have gotten me this far in one piece . I 'd like to stick with them if that 's all right . Have it your way . Thank you , commander . Make sure the other pilots are volunteers , too . Did you just hear that ? " Volunteers . " So ? So , congratulations , Husker . You just signed us up for a one-way trip . We 're on course to Djerba , a former winter resort moon in Sector 12 . Cylons took it over early in the war as a strategic outpost ... Now it 's so deep in their space that intel says it 's mostly unguarded . Some ground forces with support ships visiting periodically , but no Base Stars . A spec ops Marine Recon team has already been inserted . Our job is to deliver Dr. Kelly safely to the operators , then bug out and let them take her the rest of the way to her objective . I want all Vipers prepped by 1400 , tactical jump to follow at 1500 . Let 's get to work , gentlemen . Holy frak . Is that my old friend Jim Kirby , or are my eyes going along with the rest of me ? Coker , it 's good to see you . - How you doing , buddy ? - All good . That was a heck of a surprise , men . I read your name on the casualty list . When Valkyrie , you know ... supposedly bought it . We almost did . Ship was shot to hell . But when Command realized she could be salvaged , they saw an opportunity . They assembled a fleet of " dead " ships and head where they 're least expected . - That 's good . - Talk about creepy though . They made us all witness our own death certificates . Are you frakking kidding me ? - " Give your all for the war , " right ? - Yeah , " us or them " . So , I 'm guessing that ... you being " dead " and all , you haven 't had a chance to talk to Janey . No . I saw her . I had a couple of days leave on Picon . So what are you gonna tell me now ? She 's remarried ? Not that I 'd blame her , just this frakking war . She 's on her own man . Well , she 's ... She 's got a kid . A kid ? What 're you talking about ? She 's got a boy . He 's got her hair , man , he 's got her nose ... he 's got your eyes . Wait . What are you saying ? I 've got a son ? Is that what you 're telling me right now ? - I 've got a son ? - Yeah , you do . Anslem . - That 's his name . - That 's my father 's name . I know . Really , I got a son ? You motherfrakker ! I 've got a son . I 've got a frakking son . I got a son ! This is the Commander . 30 min to combat jump . All pilots to their planes . Action stations , set Condition One throughout the ship . Thank you . Jump ! Jump complete . No dradis contacts . Approaching launch window in ten , nine , eight , seven ... Dradis contact . Base Star bearing two-seven-five , carom four-one-two . Range two thousand . Inbound . Have they made us yet ? No . They still haven 't scrambled their Raiders . But even in stealth mode , they 're gonna pick us up on Dradis soon . And they 'll definetely see us if we try to launch . We can still abort . This is the commander . We 've encountered a Base Star . We 're going to engage . We 'll be launching the raptor along with the vipers . The objective of the viper fleet is to drag the fight away from the ice of Djerba . Kirby , Elias , you accompany the Raptor down . It is critical that Dr. Kelly reachs her objective . The fate of this war hinges on the succes of this mission . Activate all batteries and arm the nukes . They 've seen us . They 're launching Raiders . Launch . Launch all planes ! 5-3-4 , thrust positive and steady . Go for launch . Raptor Niner-zero-niner . Interval check , thrust positive and steady you are a go for launch . Thrusters engaged , dradis is green , I see them . - Raptor 's away . - Open fire . We 're down two planes . We can 't keep them bottled up any longer . Toasters bought it . Those poor bastards are outnumbered ten to one . They 're never gonna make it . Fire the nukes ! At this range we may not clear the blast . Do it ! I can 't frakin see anything . Okay , contact ! Look out , guys . I 've got two ... No , three bandits ! Two klicks and closing . Wait , wait , wait ! I see ' em ! Seven o 'clock high ! Copy that , Kirby , I 'll follow your lead . Better take us down . Betting those things can 't handle in the atmosphere . Roger that . Launchers are jammed ! Then take us in , we 'll trigger them manually . Affirmative ! These clouds are hiding a lot of crap . This is not gonna be easy . Now he gets humble . Just try to get us down in one piece , Husker ! Distance to target two klicks . Then take us in . We 'll trigger them manually . Give me manual override on the nukes . You have it . Distance is 1500 . Brace for contact , my friend . A nuke just went of . I 've lost dradis contact with the Syrius and the Base Star . Keep a grip , kid . Bandits right up our asses ! We 're gonna have to get behind them . I can do better than that ! Coker get on that tail gunner . Try to hit something this time ! You worry about the flying , I worry about the shooting . I got one ! I frakking got one ! We 're all right ! Godsdamnit ! Guys a little help here ! Please ! We 're getting our asses kicked . Got him ! Got him ! - He 's on my six , I can 't shake him ! - Wait , I see him ! Dolores is down ! I 'm hit ! Evading ! I 'm sorry , Coker . I 'm going home . Repeat again , Kirby . I didn 't copy that . I 'm going home . Kirby ! Kirby , what the frak ? I 'm out of ammo ! Coker , where is it ? - Frak . 200 m and closing ! - Good ! Hydraulics are shot . I 'm losing attitude control . We 've lost the left engine ! Let 's find a safe place to land ! Com 's shot and the nav system 's a mess . I think if I can get that left engine back on line , I could get her off the ground . No way , there 's too much damage . The only way out of here is to get Dr. Kelly to her rendezvous . Rendezvous ? Are you nuts ? Do you know how many people just died on that ship ? - I 'm talking to you ! - Hey ! Do you know how many people ? Typical crew compliment of an Orion class ship is about a hundred and fifty , not counting the pilots . Oh hey , well , let 's for fun , let 's count the pilots , 'cause I 'm pretty sure they 're frakking dead too . - Hey look ! - Get your things . We 're moving out . No , no , no , no , Husker , we 're not going anywhere unless I frakking say so ! - Husker ? - Yeah . I 'm getting tired of that frakking name ... - Come on guys .. - You know what , if the shoe fits ... And I 'm really getting tired of this frakked-up attitude . You need to soldier up and stop whining like a gutless short-timer ... That 's it ! One week out of flight school and you 're calling me yellow ? You want to go home ? The fastest way to do that is to find those Marines . I can pinpoint the location of their transponder using my encrypted tracking device . Alright ? They 're gonna have their own extraction plan . We can piggyback with them . I don 't see any alternative . This bird kept me safe for a bunch of years and I frakking hate leaving her like this . I know . Signal 's strong ahead . Hello ! They should be here . We 're still getting signal ? - Are we ? - Yes , yes . Their transponder 's here . Ugh gods ! Oh frak . What the hell happened to these guys ? These aren 't gunshot wounds . Frak ! Alright , alright . Transponder 's still broadcasting . I think we found the recon team . That 's it . We 've found them , they 're dead . This mission is a bust . I 'm going back to the raptor . Well , this has been a real treat . But I think it 's time we get out of here . Any takers ? Let 's go ! Becca ? - Coker ? - Here . Becca , where are you ? Becca ! Coker . We 're down here . Bill ? You 're OK ? Oh , is he OK ? Welcome to the party ? If that was your attempt to the rescue you got a E for effort and a F for frakking it up . You don 't appreciate crap . How are we gonna get out of here ? What the hell is this ? There 's gotta be another way out here . What was that ? Did you see that ? What the hell are these holes ? - There 's something in the walls . - What ? - What the frak was that ? - The walls we 're fraking talkin about . What was that ? What the frak was that ? Coker are you bitten ? Yes I 'm frakking bitten . - What is it ? - I don 't know . Get it of me ! I can 't get a clear shot . Hold still . Get it off of me . Shot the motherfrakker ! You 're late . Oh gods ! Are we cool with this thing in here ? Don 't worry tough guy , it 's as dead as the one down below . You must be captain Ramirez . Do I look like a Ramirez ? Captain 's on ice with the rest of the marines . I 'm all that 's left . Toth , Tech Sergeant , Demolitions . I was thinking you wouldn 't make it , man . Yeah , we almost didn 't . What the frak are these things ? Toasters have been ... using this planet to test track cyborg critters : Half machine , half organic , and very hard to kill , unless you have the right weapon . It 's very ... good eating , though . - How long you 've been here , man ? - You don 't want to know . No , thank you . Maybe later . I 'm alright for now . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't get here any quicker after I saw your signal . Speaking of which , who 's got that bitch ? Right , now ... we won 't get any more company . - That how they found your unit ? - Toasters didn 't find them . We were breaking camp in this cave , Captain send me out to recognize the neighborhood , and when I got back , well ... Well , the demons had ambushed them . Frakking abominations . Whole war 's a frakking abomination . Ain 't that right flight boy , huh ? Ain 't that right ? - Ain 't that right , frakker ? - Sergeant ! - Ain 't that right ? - Sergeant , please . I assume that you 've been briefed on my mission . How long to get us to my objective ? We .. well ... Storm 's gonna get worse and you don 't wanna be out here when it does . Plus , there 's a Toaster patrol , ... eyeball and they see better in this crap than we do . I 'm sorry , but I 've got a timetable . I can 't just sit around - and wait for the storm to pass . - Honey . It 'll blow over by morning , plus I 've got a secure location where we can hole up for tonight . - You want to pack that to go ? - Yeah , no , we just ate . - You know what ? - Uh huh . I 'm not frakking going with you , because our mission was to get ... Hey ! Apply pressure to the occipital nerve and the carotide artery unconscious in eight seconds , dead in ten . Five , six , seven , eight ... Like I said . Let 's get going . Come on . Get up ! That 's your secure location ? A frakking ski lodge ? Toasters used it as a storage facility after the initial attack . Then they just abandoned it . What were they storing ? Spare parts . Anyway , four stars and all the comforts . Some of the suites even have gas fireplaces , honey . Watch your step ! I got my babies planted all around here . Trip wires and mines . Follow me . Is it me or this guy wound a little tight ? Come on . Nice , huh ? I got a generator setup for minimal power . Just don 't turn on too many lights , for obvious reasons , and if someone or ... something comes in knocking ... Controlled bursts . We 're low on ammo . Anybody want some rack time ? Now 's your chance . I 'll take first watch . Are you all right ? Yeah . What was he like ? - My husband ? - Yeah . A lot like you , actually . Idealistic , ambitious . Was he a computer nerd , like you ? A professor , thank you very much . An historian who woke up one day and decided he couldn 't just sit back and watch history pass him by . He never wanted to be a hero , but they turned him into one anyway . Slapped his face on recruiting posters all but resurrected him in V-World . Yeah , I remember that . I 'm just gonna sleep by the fire . Yeah , I 'll make a bed over there . What you don 't remember , because they never let it out , is that afterwards a reporter found out it was all a fabrication . A lie . He didn 't take out a Cylon platoon . His scouting party was shot up by men from his own unit . Friendly fire . But like you said , it 's a war , right ? Shit happens . I saw them . All for the war . Everything they tell you to make you give up what really matters . That 's why this war has to end . I understand . Believe me , I understand . You 're going to regret this . Back home , I couldn 't afford any of this stuff . Figured it 'd be a crime to let it go to waste . May I ? Help yourself . Show some respect , do not frakking sip that . It 's nice . You had to frak her , didn 't you ? Dumb , Husker . Dumb , dumb , dumb . It wasn 't like that . It just happened . You know , I guarantee you , whatever it was like , it did not " just happen . " Case in point , I 'm guessing she did not tell you why we 're here ? No . She did . Kinda , she 's ... . She lost her husband . He was come kind of ... Her husband ? Her frakking husband . Someone just hit the tripwires . Let 's go get your girlfriend . We don 't need her getting in the way of any bullets . Becca ? Becca ? Becca ! What ? I thought she 'd wait here . She probably just got spooked . We 'll find her . I 'll take the north wing , you go south . Stay cool Husker , alright ? Keep your head down . Hey , bastards , come to daddy . Becca ? She 's okay , but this one almost nailed her before I got here . What 's that noise it 's making ? Screaming . - I 'm sorry , what ? Screaming ? - They feel pain . Got to put this thing out of its misery then . I 'm OK . It 's all over . Toth ! It 's not gonna be OK for Toth . - Toth ? - He just took out two more . He 's not gonna make it . I got his wireless . Why ? Why do you think ? Fun and games are over . I 'm sending the evac code , and we 're gonna frak outta here . - No , no ! - Please ! - Are you nuts ? - No . We complete this mission , then you can send whatever code you want , all right ? Look , kid , unless you haven 't noticed , we 're fresh out of marines and ammo . - I 'm not trained for this . - I noticed . So we 're gonna have to make do . All right ? Where are we going ? It 's an automated transmission array . Will you put your gun down , Husker . Put it down . Coker , what are you doing ? Look . You guys want to die heroes right now ? I can do that for you , right now ! Test me , Husker ! Coker , what are you doing ? - Why are you doing this ? - I can 't take it . Please , put the gun down . All right , it 's gone . You tell me why we 're here right now . - Don 't do this . - Tell me why we 're here ! This war isn 't going nearly as well as the government claims . I know . This surprise attack is a last roll of the dice . It fails , we fail . And it will fail , ... if you don 't get me where I need to go . She 's talking sense . Coker , please . So now we need to know . You tell me why we 're here . It 's an automated Cylon transmission array . Once we gain access , I will upload a virus . Can you please take the gun of my chest ? Please ? Keep talking . I will upload a virus that is designed to blind their defenses . A virus that I 've been carrying in this . And you didn 't trust me enough to tell me this before ? No . I 'm sorry . I trust you now . Good . Now we communicate . Tell us the rest . Make sure there 's no more surprises . Like I said , it 's an automated Cylon transmission array about 6 klicks from here . So , if we leave now , we 'll make it before nightfall . The facility is automated . So we shouldn 't run into too many centurion guards . That is if we 're careful not to trip the internal defense systems . The central corridor leads directly to the control room . We only need to access one of their com channels to upload the virus . A virus that is designed to spread through their entire network and lie dormant until we trigger it , disabling all of their communications in advance of an attack . Clear ! What is it ? I thought I saw something . I guess I 'm just jumpy . We are in . Come on Beka . Hurry with that thing , all right ? Come on ! It 's a large program , it 'll take ... No ! Stop ! Put it down ! Put the gun down now , Husker , or I 'll shoot you . This frakking bitch is working for them . - What ? - She 's a Cylon spy ! No ! How the frak do I stop this thing ? A spy Coker ? How could she be a spy ? Ask her about the hotel ! About the Cylon that stopped and scanned her ! What ? - I don 't know what you 're talking ... - What hotel ? ! The trakking toaster had you dead to rights ! Then it saw this thing and froze . Can you explain that to me ? Can you ? I have no idea what are you talking about . Coker , put the gun down . On the floor and calm down , okay ? - Drop the gun . - Oh , frak ! It 's not a virus , it 's a recording device . What ? Oh , frak ! You 're giving them all the info on the ghost ships , aren 't you ? You frakking bitch ! That 's why they destroyed the Archeron . So that Colonial intel ... Coker ! Stop ! I will shoot you if I have to . What ? Oh no . No ! I thought you wanted to end this war . It will end when we 'll realize that we can 't win . - That we have to negotiate . - Negotiate ? For the last 10 years , they 've been trying to wipe us out ! Stop ! They 're just defending themselves . No . They value life for more than we do . - You saw what was in that freezer Beka . - Stop ! Was that them defending themselves ? Was that them valuing life ? They 're robots ! Beka , okay ? It 's all they are . It 's all ... Are you okay , buddy ? You alright ? - Coker , you okay ? - Stop the upload ! It 's all inside and I can 't make it out . Well , then go to ... plan B , kid . - Come on , come on ! - Nonono , it 's ... It stopped but I don 't know how much as already been sent . Stop wasting time . Get yourself outta here ! You think I 'm gonna start listening to you now ? Huh ? Come on ! Okay , this is far enough . Put me down . I said put me down . Shouldn 't be long now . Hold onto that for me ? Who 's this ? It 's Katie . My wife . Why didn 't you tell me ? Sometimes you ... you miss something too much . You wouldn 't understand , kid . You have a lousy taste in women . but you 're all right , Husker . Are you alive ? Do you think because you 're more enlightened than the rest of your species , we hate you any less ? There 's our young hero . At ease , son . How you feeling today ? - Ready to get out of here , sir . - That 's the spirit . In the meantime , I wanted you to review your after-action report . Command made a few changes they need you to sign off on . Guess they felt you we 're little hard on yourself . Sir , this report , ... it says that our mission was a complete success . - That 's just a lie . - Was it ? You knew . You wanted her to upload that data . So when the cylons attacked , the fleet ... Was long gone . We hit every toaster base in five sectors . Inflicted some major damage . For a while anyway they 're gonna be on the defensive . And what about the Osiris ? What about all those people who died ? You mean all those people who gave their lives ? Right ? - You disapprove ? - Yes . - You feel used ? - Mmmh . Well , I 'm sorry son . But there 's a bit more at stake here than your personal sense of integrity . Truth is that the people support this war with their money , and they will stop if we stop giving them hope . So let them have their heroes , let them have their unblemish victories , while you and I fight the real war . Yes ? Good . We 're assembling a joint task force . Our best pilots , marines and infantry units for special ops throughout the war theater . In case you want to volunteer , there 's a shiny new Viper with your name on it waiting for you in the hangar bay . Well , maybe not with your name on it just yet . I hear you still have to pick a call sign . You think about it . What ? No cocky comebacks ? You look like crap . You want to talk ? You 're going home ? I 've got about six weeks left in my tour , so I figure out , I 'll stick around that long . Long as I don 't have to fly with you . Dear dad , I got your last letter . You 're right about preconceptions being dangerous , and not just in court . This war is turning out to be different than I expected . But maybe my mistake was to have expectations . It 's something you have to live inside of to really understand , and while a part of me already hates it , another part knows that I will make soldiering my life . But this is the life I 've chosen . And this crew , it 's my family now too . So I 'll tell you something else ... When this war is over , and some day it will be what I 'll remember most aren 't the battles but the men and women who fought them with me . And I will miss them .

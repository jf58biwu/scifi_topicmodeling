 JULIA : Chester 's Mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be , until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome . Invisible , indestructible and completely inescapable . We 're trapped . julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , but now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , none of our secrets are safe . When I say , " Jump , " you say , " How high ? " We have to tell someone . The day the dome came down , we both started having these seizures . Those Dundee guys ? They 'll never bother you again . Please ! Another dome ? Norrie . I love you so much , Mom . Just tell me what you want ! [ DOOR OPENS ] [ FLOORBOARDS creaking ] [ GUN COCKS ] [ DOOR OPENS ] What the hell are you doing here ? Dad , put down the gun . I asked you a question . What are you doing in my house ? This is my house too . Not anymore . You told me to stay away from Angie . She 's not here . How would you know that ? You been stalking the poor girl ? You feel like locking her up for another week ? I just wanna make sure she 's safe . Did you make her safe by killing Clint Dundee ? That 's right . I heard you shot that boy . He attacked Angie . I have no sympathy for the Dundee brothers , but that doesn 't qualify you to be their judge and executioner . Clint Dundee got what he deserved . Who are you to say who deserves to be punished ? You 're not in your right mind , Junior . You sound just like your mother did in the end . Please don 't say that . I 'll tell you this , though . You 're no son of mine . Not anymore . Now get out . I said , get out of here . One thing . Don 't you ever talk about my mother that way again . Ever . You 're pretty good at that . Nice military corners . I 'm pretty sure you 're thinking about a bed . Same shape . barbie [ MUTTERS ] : Yeah . Any idea when Carolyn and Norrie wanna bury her ? They haven 't come downstairs yet . Can 't imagine losing a spouse like that . Yeah . - It 's strange , huh ? - What 's that ? Alice dies . Harriet has a baby . Same house , same day . Circle of life . Too busy with your new girlfriend to go shopping , huh ? Norrie 's not my girlfriend . She 's just my girl , space , friend . How could I go shopping anyway ? Stores have all been looted . Everyone 's running low on food . You could 've taken something too . That 's stealing . You 've never stolen anything ? No . Have you ? Of course I have , dummy . Duke caught me stealing lipstick at Dee 's Pharmacy once . That 's why I started candy striping . Community service . Where were you all week , Angie ? I looked all over for you . The only person who said he saw you was Junior . Well , are you that surprised that I disappeared ? I 'm the screw-up , right ? I never thought you were a screw-up . Let 's go down to the diner . We can get something there . [ JOE sighs ] Hey . How are you feeling ? Well , my mom just died 12 hours ago , so ... how do you think ? I 'm sorry . We 're going to the diner to get something to eat . - Do you want ... ? - I 'm not hungry . - But don 't you think you should - ? - Joe . I don 't need you to take care of me . [ DOOR SLAMS SHUT ] [ COFFEE pouring ] Mm . Thank you , thank you . angle : You 're welcome . This is the last place in town with any coffee left . Enjoy it while you can , because I don 't think this is the right climate to be growing coffee beans . [ julia CHUCKLES ] I see you let yourself in . You know who else let himself in last night ? Your insane son . Saying something about Clint and Waylon Dundee , how they 'd never hurt me again . Like a wildcat bringing me a dead mouse as some kind of sick offering . - It freaked me out . - Angie ... No , you promised me that you 'd protect me . I told you that I wouldn 't tell anyone about what Junior did to me and you said that you would keep him away . It won 't happen again . I give you my word . Now , what can I do to make it up to you ? Well , the diner needs food . I mean , there 's a little , but it 'll go fast . I think it 'd be good to open this place up again . Rose would 've wanted that . I 'll talk to Ollie Dinsmore . We 'll come to an arrangement . You know , the day 's coming when the only way any of us are gonna get food is by taking it out of the ground . So from here on out , gotta be smart . " From here on out " ? You think the dome is gonna be here forever ? jim : Julia . julia : Councilman . How are you doing ? What is that ? It 's nothing . Ollie . OLLlE : I don 't expect you came out here to apologize for casting aspersions on my good name . Look , Ollie ... Chester 's Mill is coming up on a serious food shortage . Now , you and I , we can work together to solve this situation . Share our resources . Well , I know you need my water to grow crops , but , uh , what is it you have that I need ? - Propane . - Propane . Ah . Well , it 's helpful , I 'll give you that . My ancestors made do without irrigation systems or DVD players . I expect we can get by without them now . You mean , so you would starve people just to get back at me ? OLLlE : Course not . But I sure wouldn 't mind starving you out . When this town realizes that having you as a councilman makes for empty stomachs , well , they 're gonna drum you out faster than a knife fight in a phone booth . And I 'll be more than happy to fill your shoes . Best of luck to you , Jim . Glad you came in . Feel like faking it as a deputy a while longer ? Well , I told you I 'd be happy to stay on and help in a freelance capacity . [ FOOTSTEPS ] Junior , what are you doing in here ? I need a gun for patrol . Well , maybe it 's better you left it here . So , what , you don 't trust me ? After what happened yesterday , I gotta say that I don 't . If we weren 't so shorthanded by the dome , I would 've fired your ass . So am I on the force or not ? Let 's call it probation . And no gun until I say you 've earned it . jim : Linda . Linda , I need you . And you too , Barbie . Ollie Dinsmore 's dead set on keeping that well to himself . If he thinks he can toy with this town just to satisfy his own power-hungry whims , he 's sorely mistaken . Can 't we negotiate with him ? I got a better plan . Eminent domain . It 's in the town bylaws . The right of the government to confiscate private property - I know what it is . How do you think Ollie 's gonna feel about you just marching in there and taking his land ? That 's why I 'm bringing the police . Get Carter . Junior too . Meet me in front of the hall in an hour . So are you moving back in ? Till Mom and Dad get back , yeah . Better get used to me being your legal guardian . Has Carolyn come out of her room yet ? Nope . She 's still up there sitting next to the corpse of her dead wife . - You know what I 've been thinking ? - What ? I 've been thinking it was your idea to go to the center of the dome . We never would 've found that egg thing if you hadn 't led us there . She had the heart attack right when we touched it . She died because we touched it . Bad things happen when we 're together . So as soon as Carolyn 's ready , we 're just gonna find somewhere else to stay because I don 't think I should be around you anymore . - Norrie ... - I 'd like to be alone now . I said , I 'd like to be alone . Leave me alone , Joe ! [ police sirens wailing ] CARTER : I wonder where Ollie went . Guess he figured discretion 's the better part of valor . Just like I thought . Carter . Secure the well . Well , now , that didn 't take long . You 're trespassing on private property . It 's not private anymore . OLLlE : That 's a peculiar claim , seeing as the deed 's been in my family for 75 years now . By whose authority was it rendered un-private ? The township of Chester 's Mill . Ah . So your authority . Well , heh , I 'm afraid I don 't recognize that . Or yours , either , sweetheart , if you decide to stand with Big Jim Rennie . In fact , anybody that stands by Big Jim can look forward to a tough haul ahead . See , whatever food we produce , with my water , stays with us . Tell that to your precious township . Best move away from that well now , son . Go on . Scoot . Wendell . Kneecap . [ CARTER SCREAMS ] barbie [ whispers ] : Put your gun down . OLLlE : Like I said , this is private property . Any attempt to commandeer this land , this well , will be met with most serious consequences . Now , get off my land . Junior ! You need any help ? How about you take that gun off your daddy ? I 'm asking you nicely to leave now before anyone else gets hurt . You okay ? Norrie thinks it 's my fault that Alice died . No . She doesn 't think that . Come on . I 'll let you in on a little secret . Women say a lot of things they don 't mean . Especially at that age . I 've never met anyone like her before . It 's kind of amazing to feel that connected . It 's even more intense at the egg . The egg ? What egg ? Joe , you can trust me . And if it 's something to do with the dome , we all have a right to know . Yesterday , Norrie and I , we found this egg . Totally black . With its own little dome around it . Take me to it . Now . Guess old Ollie had a little more support than you anticipated , huh ? Only reason those farmers are backing him is they need water for their crops . Whoever controls that well can expect allegiance . - When we go back there - - Yeah , hold on , hold on . - When we go back ? - That 's right . The three of us against all those guys ? Because we just dropped Carter off at the clinic with his knee shot out . - Your son ... - Muster extra men . Jim , if we do that , it 's only gonna escalate things . There has to be a diplomatic solution here . He shot a deputy , there 's no diplomatic solution . We go back there and we take the well . Now , I 'm gonna go round up some volunteers . We 'll meet at the diner in an hour and we 'll move out from there . barbie : Hold on . I think I got another way . Come on . All right , so when Jim showed us this after the water tower collapse , he mentioned there were other artesian wells , right ? - So here 's Ollie 's . - Yeah . What about these other ones ? You got here , here ... - Dried out . - Why 's that ? Well , back in the day , when Ollie 's family first dug their well , it siphoned off the water from all the other ones . There also used to be a small reservoir in town before the tower was built , but Ollie 's well sapped that too . Okay , so say we destroy Ollie 's well . And divert the water back to the dry ones and the reservoir . That 's right . No more Ollie cornering the market on H20 . We 'll need explosives . Farmers in town , they gotta have fertilizer . Well , I know Ollie has ammonium nitrate and blasting caps at his farm for planting season . - It 's dangerous , but - - But it 's gotta be done . All right , that 's what we 'll do . We 'll see if we can 't get Jim to call an audible . All right , we got a job to do . First of all , do we have enough ammunition ? MEN : Yeah . jim : All right , second ... - Familiar with Ollie 's property ? - Hey , Phil . Ever shot a gun before ? Course I have . My dad and my uncles were Marines , so I 've been handling weapons since I was a kid . I 'm counting on each and every one of you . Let 's do this . MAN 1 : All right . MAN 2 : Let 's do it , yeah . Good to see you two . Just about ready to move out . Yeah , before we do that , I think Linda and I came up with an alternative . Barbie 's gonna blow up the well . Yeah . We redirect the water to an alternate source , it 's crisis averted . What are you , a demolition expert ? What if you 're wrong ? You contaminate the town 's only remaining water supply . Then we 're worse off than we were before . Okay . Your plan goes wrong , how many people die ? Damn sight fewer than if we have nothing to drink . Now , get this through your heads . The only objective is the well . The only obstacle is Ollie . The only way we nip this in the bud is to make an example of him . We get Ollie , we get the well , everyone gets water , we start growing food again . Is that clear ? I guess he 's not giving us his blessing . Better hurry . I 'll delay him as long as I can . So tell me , son , wanna put in an application to be my number two ? How about you don 't call me " son " ? That 's fair enough . But make me understand how you decided to become a free agent . My dad kicked me out . Well , fathers and sons , it 's never a walk in the park . And I can 't imagine your dad 's an easy man to live with , especially after your mother died . He took it hard . It was ... a tragic accident . Accident ? Is that what he told you ? My mother died in a car crash . That part 's true enough , but it wasn 't an accident . It was a suicide , pure and simple . You don 't know that . Oh , but I do . I 'm sure you remember how troubled she was . junior : You 're lying . What cause would I have to lie to you , James ? I 'll always tell you the truth . Your father , though , uh , I doubt he ever will . When this is over , the town will be well rid of Big Jim Rennie . Take it . It 's old as dirt , but the aim is true . I 'll give you a moment . Sometimes a man needs to be alone with his thoughts . Ollie . Promise me you won 't kill him . Because I wanna do it . Don 't you feel like the dome 's here for a reason ? I mean , I think it is . It brought us together . Me and Norrie , you and Barbie . Me and Barbie ? Yeah . Well , aren 't you guys , like , a thing ? [ julia CHUCKLES ] Whoa . It 's pink . It was black before . JOE : The monarch will be crowned . What did you just say ? JOE : Who are you talking to ? The monarch will be crowned . What did you just see ? You . Julia . What happened back there ? I don 't know . I think I might be losing my mind . What did you mean when you said you saw me ? Like another me ? Yeah . And you spoke to me . I did ? When we saw Alice , she didn 't say anything . When you saw Alice ? Yeah , yesterday . When Norrie and I touched the mini-dome . That 's something you could have mentioned , Joe . [ sighs ] So , what did I say ? I mean , the other me . " The monarch will be crowned . " " The monarch will be crowned " ? Yes . What do you think it means ? I don 't know . But I need to find out . We saw Alice and then she died . Does that mean something bad 's gonna happen to me too ? WENDELL : See anything ? - Went around the grounds . Nothing . Didn 't think it 'd be this quiet . WENDELL : The barn . Start with the barn . [ DOOR OPENS ] Oh . Uh ... Sorry . I just needed to get some fresh clothes . It 's your room . I 'm just crashing here . How did you end up here in Chester 's Mill anyway ? I was supposed to go to this girls ' camp for reprogramming . Second Horizons . I know it well . - You know it ? - Yeah . Had kind of a preferred guest membership there for a stretch . It was my mom 's stupid idea to force me to go . If we stayed in Los Angeles , she 'd still be alive . So it 's the bitch 's own fault she 's dead . Anyway , that 's how I got stuck here . You ever been to New York ? Lots of times . You ? Uh-uh . Who gave you this , then ? Someone I used to know . Whenever a friend of mine would take a trip someplace , they 'd always bring me back one of these , and ... heh , it just became a thing . And I promised myself I would go to every single one of these places , - but now ... - You 're in a snow globe . I always thought of Chester 's Mill like a prison . But until recently , I didn 't know what a prison really was . You know what will make me feel better ? So , New York City , I never much liked musicals anyway . [ GRUNTS ] Wow , that felt good . NORRlE : Goodbye , Paris , France . I got C 's in your lame language anyway , so you can suck it . Au revoir , la bibliotheque . [ BOTH LAUGH ] [ inaudible ] [ GRUNTS THEN GLASS SHATTERS ] Los Angeles . [ sobbing ] It 's my fault . She died because of me . Oh , my God , no , no , no . I killed her . No , no . No , you didn 't . No , you didn 't . No . It 's okay , it 's okay . MAN : All right , move out . Move tight . Yeah , move . Right there . What did you see ? Okay , Ollie 's in the house . Got a few men up on the balcony , a couple more out by the well . Did you see my s - ? Junior ? No . All right . Go over there with that group . Everybody get ready , wait for my signal . Maybe we shouldn 't rush this . Well , we outnumber them . The longer we wait to attack , the jumpier everyone gets . - Attack ? These are our neighbors . - They 're not my neighbors . Jim , your son is with them . My son made a choice to betray me . Phil , take your group , go over there by the fence . phil : Mm-hm . Where 's Barbie ? MAN 1 : Come on . MAN 2 : All right . Linda , where is he ? MAN 3 : Let 's go . - Damn it ! What , he thinks he 's gonna be a hero ? He 's gonna jeopardize my whole plan . We gotta move out now . My guys stay with me . Come on . Let 's go . Move out . MAN 4 : Let 's go . [ gunfire NEARBY ] [ MAN SCREAMS ] What do we have here ? Uh-uh . Drop it . [ BOTH grunting ] [ MEN GRUNT ] [ phil GRUNTS ] Phil ! [ GRUNTS ] - You okay ? Come on . phil : I 'm okay . [ DETONATOR BEEPS ] MAN 1 : Hold your fire ! Damn it , Barbie . MAN 2 : Stand . MAN 3 : Throw down your guns . - The well . They blew up the well . MAN 4 : Let 's get out of here . Come on ! - Hey ! MAN 5 : Move out ! MAN 6 : Fight 's over . - Where you going ? Stand your ground ! OLLlE : Wasn 't enough you blew up that propane truck , Jim . You had to dynamite my well too ? That wasn 't me , Ollie . [ GRUNTS ] See how he lies ? Where you scurrying off to ? Well 's blown . You thought we were fighting for you ? Fair-weather friends , huh ? What now ? He 's all yours . Just like you wanted . [ tires screeching ] Joe , what are you doing ? I could 've killed you . Is he okay ? - Phil ? linda : He 's fine . Stay out of the road . [ SlREN wailing ] Come on . - Junior ... - Shut your mouth . The only thing that 's gonna come out of it is more lies . You told me she died in a car crash . She did die in a car crash . You told me it was an accident . But it wasn 't an accident , was it ? Was it ? No . It wasn 't an accident . What happened , then ? - Please , Junior ... - What happened ? Your mother had been ... unsteady for a while . This one night ... we argued and she ran out and got in the car . A witness said she stopped . Pointed the lamps at a 200-year-old oak . She must 've hit the tree going 80 miles an hour . Went right through the windshield . Duke helped me cover it up . Gave the witness some cash , and ... the story changed . Why did you lie to me ? I don 't know . junior : Why did you lie to me ? Because I didn 't want you to know . I didn 't want you to know ... that - [ SOBS ] That she chose to leave you . - That she chose to leave us . OLLlE : Enough . Was that the truth ? I 'm sorry , son . I 'm so sorry . You got a problem with this ? Allow me . [ SHOTGUN fires ] [ PANTS ] I believe you . JOE : Should I tell her what happened ? Later . Just be her friend for now . Go talk to her . It 'll be all right , I promise . Joe . You 'll be all right too . I 'm sorry for what I said . It 's okay . I 'm ready to bury my mom . We waited for you . Angie said we should , so ... She 's all right , your sister . I know . [ DOOR OPENS ] Buy you a drink ? People died today , Jim . How many ? Three of theirs . Two of ours . Because of me , there is no more " theirs " and " ours . " Because of you , five people died . Now , they 'd be alive right now if you 'd listened to me . It worked . Town 's got a reservoir again . That 's great news . Yeah , it is . Not so much for you , though . You wanted that well , right ? So you 'd control it ? Control us ? Isn 't that right ? I 'm not gonna dignify that with a response . You don 't need to . You don 't want to make an enemy of me , Barbie . There 's two sides to that coin , Jim . You 're back . Ollie Dinsmore is dead . He was gonna kill my father , so I killed him . I thought you joined his team . It was kind of a Trojan horse thing . I went into his camp and ... destroyed him from the inside . Why don 't you go home , Junior ? Because I don 't have a home . [ KNOCKS ON DOOR ] How was your day , honey ? I 've had better . How about you ? Well ... I 've seen some things today that have been testing the limits of my comprehension . What do you think of when I say , " The monarch will be crowned " ? What are you talking about ? I wish I knew . " The monarch will be crowned . "

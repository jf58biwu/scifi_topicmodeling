Curtis , I have something really important to tell you , too . Curtis , what are you doing ? What do you mean ? I used the book of pure evil to make a new arm . No one 's gonna pick on me anymore .

We 'll get you to the science lab , run a few tests , we 'll figure out how to reverse it , okay ? No ! I 'm not a guinea pig , Hannah . You care more about tests and science than you do about me ! The book doesn 't care about you either , Curtis ! This isn 't you . Hey , Hannah ! Wait . Don 't touch me with that ! Wait ! Dammit ! Well , none of the other teachers will listen to me , but every time those two run out of the room , it 's bad news .

When you 're back 's against the wall , you push back into their faces . You pull their teeth out . You put it where their eyes are . You take their ears and you box them . I didn 't know what that meant , but I thought it was cool . You take them to the bank and then you take them to the cleaner with the money from the bank . That 's where I 'm taking you , and no one will know where you are . Cause I won 't tell them , and you won 't leave a forwarding address . Boring . Keep your eye on the pendant . Let your conscious mind go . Don 't fight it . Do - I can 't believe that actually worked . Bingo will commence in the main hall in fifteen minutes . Don 't forget to bring your dabbers !

What happened to my old arm ? I 've been here before . It was a few years ago ... Me and Todd had just gotten into heavy metal and shop class . I wanted to make a cool candlestick using the lathe . Hey , Curtis . What are you talking about , I want the book . You wanna smoke a J before class ? I had never smoked a J before . Okay , what are you , what are you talking about ? But when I put that sweet herb to my lips and breathed deep . What does this have to do with the book ? I knew I 'd never be the same again . Where is the book ? The book ! How did I forget that ? Wow , talk about repressed memories . Actually , let 's not . So your best friend cut off your arm ? Maybe Todd is the pure evil one . Todd . Pure . Evil . Okay , shut the fuck up about Todd .

 Anyone designated as Category 1 must be taken to the new Overflow Camps . GWEN : Assistance needed , please . - Assistance now ! - Come on . Look , he 's my dad , OK ? He 's my father . Now , I need you to look after him . Sorry , your father 's been reclassified - he 's Category 1 . - My father is not dead . - Then we have to move him . All Category 1 s go to the module . So we need to get inside the camp to find out what those modules are . Welcome , welcome . My name is Colin Maloney , and I 'm in charge here . - Come on , come on ! - Get your hands the hell off me ! - [ GUNSHOT ] - Ah ! Colin , Jesus ! [ ALARM BELL RINGS ] Oh , shit . GWEN : The patients . They 're burning them alive . REX : Vera ! WOMAN : I pulled everything I could find on the Shanghai Deal , and you 're due to chair the PhiCorp executive board at four o 'clock . Thanks , Janet . Stuart , is everything all right ? You don 't seem happy . STUART : Everything 's fine . We 're living in miraculous times . I couldn 't be happier . You shouldn 't call me Stuart in the office . Sorry , Mr. Owens . Of course , suicide is impossible now but people are becoming inventive . They 're finding ways to get as close to death as possible . That 's the philosophy of the 45 Club , people who believe that jumping from 45 ﬂoors up or higher is the only guaranteed way to lose consciousness for ever . It 's sick , but just the same , the 45 Club is catching on . MAN : I 've seen the reports from New York , from San Francisco , London , Milan , they all indicate ... [ RINGING TONE ] Wai . Who 's calling , please ? It 's Stuart Owens . How can I help you , sir ? This must be strictly confidential . My eyes only . Is that acceptable ? Of course . In 1999 , a large parcel of land , near Shanghai Center , was purchased by a division of PhiCorp . But that 's where the records end . I need to know exactly what ? Happened to the land since then . PhiCorp Construction ? Not on paper . There are subsidiaries , shell companies . May I ask what this is about ? Do you need to know ? It could be of some help . Of course , you are aware of the changes going on in the world . Yes . My uncle was dying . Now he 's not . I 'm trying to understand what happened , whether PhiCorp had anything to do with it . I believe this construction site is key . I asked my uncle what happened . He told me to never question a miracle . You may not like what you find . He may be right . Call me back in a few hours . [ MAN SHOUTS IN DISTANCE ] [ SILENCED GUNSHOT ] [ RINGING TONE ] Wai It 's me . You told me to call back . Yes . What did you find ? - A dead end . - What do you mean ? What are they building ? There 's nothing there . I looked . I found nothing , nothing at all . Good bye , Mr. Owens . My name is Rex Matheson . I 'm with the CIA . I 'm on an operation inside the San Pedro Overflow . No , strike that . I 'm not with the CIA or any US Government authority . I 'm with Torchwood , and we 're going to expose everything that 's going on here , everything that I just witnessed . [ GRUNTS ] Uh ! They 're calling them Category 1 s , and from what I 've seen , don 't ever let them call you that . The minute you hear Category 1 , you better get the hell out of Dodge , because they are going to burn you . That 's what this place is for ... incineration . And we all know the drill . They 'll start with the Category 1 s the ones who can 't protest . Then they 'll go on to convicted felons or illegal immigrants , hell ... anyone we just don 't like , because everybody gets sick , which means , one day , everybody ends up here . Those ovens are waiting for all of us . But I will tell you one thing ... I 'm going to find the bastard that killed Vera . Oh , yeah , and I 'm going to burn his ass . [ ALARMS BUZZ ] End of shift . We 're done . Oh , erm ... Guess we should go . Damn straight . They don 't pay overtime . And make sure you get paid in cash , not cheques . I 've got $ 2,000 with the savings expedition . They said , " You can 't remove it . " I said , " That 's my money . " They said , " It 's a national emergency . " I said , " Well , If it 's an emergency , then I 'm going to need every cent . " Hey , I , um , I forgot my cell . You go on ahead . Don 't wait for me . - What happened to her ? - Not a problem , not any more . I scrubbed my hands raw . But you see it on TV . They ... still find tiny little flecks of blood under the nails . What did you do to her ? Always have a fresh shirt , Ralph . Only brought it in case I had time for badminton ... at the club . The club . That 'd be nice right now , a game of badminton ... Colin ... that module thing , what happens there ? It 's " Mr. Maloney " . It 's " sir " . I 'd like to know , sir . What happens in that module ? It 's not my fault . It 's the ... system . The module was storage . We were supposed to use it as storage until some senator signs some paperwork and gives the command . I just did things a little early , - that 's all . - But what did you do ? You 're kidding me . They didn 't tell you ? Tell me what ? They asked me to stay on . Double shift . They said to go check in with the categorization center , help with processing . They say one thing and then they say another . [ SHE KNOCKS ] - What is it ? - I just , um ... I just received these forms . And I 'm new , I don 't know what to do , but , um , I think they 're for you . - What forms ? - Um ... I don 't know . Some ... sort of wage form in cash . Not sure . Just leave ' em on the desk . Badminton . I 'm sorry ? Badminton . I ... I was sweating profusely . Do you play ? No , sir . Right . OK , um ... So , well , I was sent to be your liaison and ... if there 's anything else I can do for you , just ask , anything at all . I 'm fine . - Tea ? Coffee ? Or ... - No , thanks . Fine . Back to work with you . Come on , hop , skip , jump . Yes , sir . Oh , my God . I did not agree to this . - Everything 's going to be fine . - But we murdered her ! No , no ... The modules were designed to kill . Therefore , death within this compound is legal . How does that work ? Because I say so ! Did you see these day staff ? They 're illegal immigrants , all of them . They can 't even spell . Look at this . This is wrong ... - We 're going to get arrested for this . - No . No , we won 't . No , no , no , no . Cos this is what you 're gonna do . This is wrong . This is wrong . It might make sense in Mexico , but not here . This is wrong ! You 're going to take her car and drive it into San Pedro . You know that shopping mall ? The Constitution Mall ? Drop it off there . It 's a huge car park , thousands of cars . And we 've got trucks that go past there every half hour , so just authorize yourself to drive back . She goes missing , it 's got nothing to do with us . - Is that going to work ? - Ralph ... they 're never going to find her , she 's dust . Oh , Jesus . And we put this place on a red alert , complete lockdown . Cos lockdown means that every member of the staff is logged and noted . It 'll give us a perfect alibi . She disappeared halfway across town while we were on duty all night . Security ? Yeah , give me the chief . We 're going to Condition One . REX : They 're moving men and equipment to the gates . Something 's going on . [ ALARMS BUZZ ] Let 's go , everybody . Lockdown . That 's right . We 're officially in lockdown , folks . Nobody leaves until further notice . Yes , sir . This is a drill . We 're testing our readiness in case of emergency . LOUD SPEAKER : This site / is now in lockdown . I repeat , this site is in immediate lockdown . It 's a lockdown . Yeah . Look at that - they 're closing the gates on the slaughterhouse . There 's no way they 're stopping me . I will get this evidence out . I said it 's lockdown , Miss ... What is it ? Esther . Esther Drummond . Sorry , I just needed to call home . Well , read the rule book . All exterior calls have to be authorized by me . What about visitors , sir ? Shouldn 't we escort them out ? Isn 't that observer still here ? The one from Washington ... - Dr ... Juarez ? - No , she left . She 's gone . Matter of fact , she said I was running an excellent command . Very good indeed . That 's her exact words - " Very good indeed " . Dr. Patel ? Are you Dr. Alicia Patel ? I 'm sorry , can it wait ? No , listen , you 've got to change this paperwork . There 's been a mistake . It 's about my father . Geraint Wyn Cooper , he 's been placed in Category 1 , but he 's not that bad , I swear . - I 've seen him , he 's just unconscious - Well , it 's debatable . There 's a fine line between Category 1 and 2 ... No , but you saw him . You labeled him . And there 's definitely been a mistake . I 'm just following the guidelines given by the government . Can you take another look ? If I did that for you , I 'd have to do it for everyone . - We 're under enough pressure as it is . - I understand , but li ... Sorry , listen . You ... You have to change this , OK ? They move the Category 1s at 6am They 'll take him to the module . Sorry , not my department . Really ? Is that so ? Well , do you even know what your department is , Dr. Patel ? Do you even know what really happens here ? Do you know what happens in the module ? Like I said , I 'm rather busy . They burn people . They burn living people . The Category 1 s , they 're still alive , but they 're being burnt . This place has been built around institutional murder . I 'm not the one who makes the rules . You knew about this ? Category 1 s are dead . That 's the law . Under the emergency rulings for the sake of public health , dead bodies can be incinerated en masse . Well , I 'm glad you 've got the law on your side . But are you actually there , in the module ? Are you actually throwing the switch ? Well , are you ? No . No , you 're here . You 're nice and safe , hidden behind your paperwork . You haven 't got the nerve to actually watch them burn . Because then you 'd have to face the truth , wouldn 't you ? That this isn 't a hospital , this is a concentration camp . If you 'll excuse me ... They built a concentration camp here in Britain today , and you ... you , you are one of the staff ! The entire healthcare system is about to collapse . - What else am I supposed to do ? - You say no . You say no , that 's what you do . For the love of God , you say no . - But I can 't . - Don 't you dare . Don 't you dare . Don 't you dare look at me and tell me you 're obeying orders . Don 't you bloody dare . Oh ... and one more thing ... don 't call yourself a doctor . Not any more . Shame on you . Rhys ! Oh , my God , I was driving them to the module ! I was driving living people into the ovens ! You weren 't to know , all right ? You were just doing your job . Yeah , well , I 'm not doing it any more . - I quit the bastard thing . - Well , not just yet . I need you to do one more transfer for me ... my dad , we 're taking him out . We can 't . The , um , the compound 's closed down . - No more movement orders till 6am . - I know , Rhys ! That 's when they 're going to take my father to his death ! All right ? I need you to steal some keys . I need you to get a hold of a lorry . I don 't ... I don 't know . I just need you to do something . - Of course I will . - The , um ... The nurses , they change over at Sam That 's our only chance . - I 'll get my dad , you get a truck , OK ? - OK ! We can do this , OK ? We can beat the system . We can beat them all . All right ? Go ! [ PHONE BEEPS ] No , Janet , you don 't know me , but ... I know you . Yeah ? You work at PhiCorp ? You didn 't answer my question . What are you drinking ? Appletini . Your name is Janet Rae Tanner . You 're 27 years old , 5 ' 9 " , 119 lbs . The youngest daughter of Gerald and Elaine Tanner of Nantucket , Massachusetts . You moved to California to attend college , where you earned a bachelor 's degree in art history . You currently reside at a Westwood apartment . You go to the gym three times a week and you drive your hybrid downtown every day to an administrative assistant position at PhiCorp Industries . And you 're some creepy stalker dude last seen on America 's Most Wanted . I may be wanted , but it 's not what you think . Listen , I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , but ... I 'm meeting someone . After he has dinner with his wife . I came across some e-mails from you to your boss , Stuart Owens . [ SCOFFS ] " Can 't wait to see you . " Nice . Then " Happy Valentine 's Day . " Sweet ! Then a little less subtle . " You can so do me tonight . " Ouch ! What do you want ? I want your help , Janet . Right now , I 've got some friends risking their lives because we think PhiCorp is doing some very bad things and we need to find out who 's behind it . Please , you can 't tell anybody about us . I won 't . I just want some information from your boss . I wouldn 't do anything to hurt him . Sweet Janet Rae , I wish he felt the same about you . I 'm sending you some more e-mails from Stuart Owens to the head of PhiCorp human resources , requesting your transfer to Cincinnati ! Whoo-hoo ! He 's such a romantic . Bastard . I like the bit where he calls you " limited ... " Limited . " So what do you say , Janet ? We could sit here drinking appletinis and complaining about men all night . Or we can go get that PhiCorp boss of yours . What do you say , Janet Rae ? [ MURMUR OF CONVERSATION ] Love the vintage coat ! Thanks . Maybe the three of us should have a drink sometime . - The three of us ? - You , me ... and the coat . [ SMACK ] Well , I suppose I should have the salad . I 'd go for the steak if I were you , with a very large bourbon and a pack of cigarettes . Why not ? We 're going to live for ever , right ? Courtesy of PhiCorp . Excuse me , I think you 're at the wrong table . You 're Stuart Owens , aren 't you ? You 're the Chief Operating Officer for PhiCorp Industries . Well , you obviously know who I am or you wouldn 't be here . The question is , who are you ? I 'm a friend of Janet 's . Your secretary ? We met at a bar , the one you were planning on going to after dinner . [ WHISPERS LOUDLY ] Does your wife know ? - Elizabeth ... - Don 't go , or we 'll hurt her . My associates are holding Janet hostage . - You need proof ? - [ RINGING TONE ] - Hello ? Who 's there ? - Help . Help me . - Janet , where are you ? - I don 't know . I 'm in a cellar . They 've got me tied up . They 're hurting me , Stuart ' . Make them stop . What exactly do you want ? I 'll let you know when it 's safe to release her . Go get him . The truth . About what ? The miracle . How was it done ? Why was it done ? How can it be undone ? - Why would I have the answer ? - When the day came , PhiCorp was ready . We found warehouses stocked with painkillers - waiting for the miracle to come along . - That 's your smoking gun ? You 're a man in charge . - You knew it was coming . - Mr ... Harkness . Captain Jack Harkness . - Are you with the military ? - Freelance . I represent the people who are trying to stop PhiCorp . So that security breach - on the 33rd floor ... - That was us . It 's not me you 're after . In fact , I 've been trying to find out the truth just as much as you . I 'm not ... a bad man , Mr. Harkness . - Captain . - I 'm not a bad man , Captain . I 'm not a good one , either . I 'm a middleman , in every sense of the word . And faced with the thought of being who I am for God knows how long , I 'm just as keen as you to find out exactly what 's going on . Especially with the stock market threatening to collapse , a man like me needs insurance . [ LAUGHS ] You don 't believe me . You think I 'm the epitome of evil , the devil in a three-piece suit . In my experience , that 's how it works . Your experience must be rather simple . You have a rather archaic view of good versus evil , don 't you ? Tell me who 's behind this . I 've been trying to find out ! I 've sent agents all over the world following the paper trail , the back-room deals , the holding companies within holding companies . That 's when I came face to face with the true face of evil . - The system itself . - Precisely . If schemes and conspiracies are being plotted , then they must be seen only as patterns , waves ... shifts that are either too small or too vast to be perceived . Someone is playing the system , right across Planet Earth , with infinite grace beyond any one person 's sight . No , I 'm sorry , Captain , but PhiCorp isn 't controlling this . Profiting , yes , but this is part of a much larger design , way beyond any of us . But how can you be part of it and not know what 's going on ? Let me give you an example - these warehouses full of drugs , no doubt you 'd love to uncover an incriminating memo dated the day before Miracle Day , signed by me , authorizing the stockpiling of painkillers . The truth is , a pattern like that began , say , maybe five years ago with the systematic increase in production in random factories around the world , based on market-share projections . Where was the warehouse ? Washington DC , 3rd and Boston . I 'd imagine transportation of the drugs to the 3rd and Boston was then carried out over a 12-month period by , say , maybe five different haulage companies outsourced to seven or eight different independent suppliers . So that means everyone 's to blame - everyone and no-one . Whoever is behind this , they don 't show themselves . Not to me , not to you . But to play the system like this ... the markets , the politics , industry ... they had to be planning this for a very long time . I wish I knew who they were . I was told that the miracle involves geography . - Does that mean anything ? - No . But there is one word that my operatives picked up dating back to the mid - ' 90s - and then erased . - What is it ? The Blessing . What does it mean ? There was a document from Italy from a source inside the Council Of Ministers , a contact then deceased . It simply referred to the Blessing . It said , " They have found the Blessing . " MAN : Excuse me . Could you direct us - to Mr. Owen 's table ? - That 's his table there . It seems my wife called the authorities . Hmm . Go ahead . [ HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD ] [ HELICOPTER WHIRRS OVERHEAD ] [ CRASHING ] What the hell was that ? Check it out . Sir ? Are you all right ? What 's a Cat 1 doing out here ? Sorry . RADIO : Billy , do you read me ? - Uh , yeah . Yeah , it 's me . - What 's going on ? - Well , we got new orders . - New orders ? Yeah . They need you at the modules . They , um , they need more men at the module . You 'd better get down there pronto . I 'm already here . What about the checkpoint ? I don 't know , they said to just leave it . They said , um ... I don 't know what they said I wasn 't listening . That sounds like you . I 'm on my way . LOUD SPEAKER : Identify yourself . Uh ... - identify yourself - Just need to get out . Going out for a smoke . Sure , man . Go ahead . Who the hell are you ? Someone 's breached the compound , someone with a camera . No , no , no . Nothing 's going wrong . Nothing , nothing , nothing ... He wants to talk to whoever 's in charge . No , he doesn 't . No , no , no . No , he doesn 't . No . OK ... who is he ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - I don 't know . He said , " Torchwood . " All right , you wait here . I 'll deal with it . Mr. Maloney , I need your signature on this . - Not now . - I can walk with you , but ... I said , " Not now ! " So where 's he going ? Where do you think you 're going ? Mr. Maloney . How blonde are you ? It 's a lockdown . We haven 't got clearance . Got to stay at your desk . I 'm telling you right now , you 're making a big mistake . You 're gonna all be implicated , all of you . All right , leave us alone . Go to Jackson on the west gate . He 's got new allocations for you . So , who the hell are you ? I 'll ask the questions . - I need to know who you are . - I told them already , Rex Matheson . Now , who the hell are you ? Colin Maloney , thank you , director of the San Pedro Facility . Director , hmm . There 's going to be hell to pay , cos you 're the man in charge . - What do you mean ? - Look , just call the police , OK ? Go ahead , call them . Arrest me . Because I want to make a statement . I 'm going to expose everything that 's going on here , what you guys are doing to the patients and what you did to Vera . - What they did to who ? - You built ovens ! And you 're the director so you know that . I 'm not in charge of policy . We had instructions that got sent out nationwide , worldwide . And we had orders from above not to say anything . I just did as I was told . OK . All right . OK , you 're the middleman . I get it . But I 'm telling you right now you need to listen . Because you 're caught in the middle of this thing just like me . There are things are happening here that 's way out of control . Someone 's using this place to bring back murder ! There was a Dr. Juarez on this site , right ? Hmm ? Yeah ? Well , someone burned her alive . - No , no , no , no , no . Couldn 't happen . - And you 've got the chance now ... Look at me . Look at me . You 've got the chance to make yourself a hero , because we could tell the world . - Yeah , I 'd be a hero ? - Colin ... my man , when this thing blows wide open , people will stand trial for crimes against humanity . But you see , you ... you could be standing right by me , right by my side . Well , I suppose , er ... it 's my duty to help . If we could find the one to blame ... Must be ... one of the staff , one of the guards . All right , well , look , I 've got evidence . It 's right there . Go ahead , take a look . They took it off me . I taped it . I taped everything . You can see it all . It 's proof that someone 's using the modules for murder , not just the Category 1 s either . I don 't know . I ... I shouldn 't . Do you want proof , hmm ? Then look at it . Take a look at it . Play the tape , damn it , and you 'll see why you need to let me go . I don 't know . I shouldn 't . Yeah , play it . I 'm sorry . Um , Mr. Maloney just called about that Torchwood man . Sorry , I 'm new to all this . But he wanted me to ask , is his name Rex Matheson ? Yeah . OK . I 'll call them back . Oh , um , what extension was he on ? I don 't know . Generator room . That was it . Yeah , thanks . I told you , you can 't go out in a lockdown . I said you 're not allowed outside . I 'm reporting you ! I 'm sorry . I knew you had to see that . - You OK ? - Oh , yeah . All right , so now do you see ? You see why you need to release me , right ? So come on , we should go to the police together , right now . I don 't know , it 's a ... I haven 't got anything I can ... You hurt yourself ? Oh , yeah . It 's a long story . But come on ... how about we get out of here , huh ? I wonder ... What can I use ? What can 1 ... ? They gave you the keys . - Yeah , but what can I use ? - You have the keys . I just can 't focus , can 't think . [ SIGHS ] I 've never been too practical . I 'm more of an ideas man . I 'm very good at badminton . Yea h , all right . Say , how about you , um , unlock me now ? It 'll have to do . What are you doing ? Hey , Colin , look at me . Colin , what are you doing ? Look at me in my eyes . Colin , what are you doing ? Don 't do that . Look at me . Colin , look at me in my eyes . Look at me ! Colin . Colin ! Don 't do it . Argh ! [ SCREAMS IN AGONY ] It was you ! I 'm sorry . You killed her ! I 'm very sorry . It 's just been such a long day . All I want to do is go home . But you can 't kill me . Don 't do it . I can 't die . You can 't kill me . Colin , don 't you see ? I won 't die . Argh ! [ SCREAMS IN AGONY ] Mr. Maloney ? Mr. Maloney ? I 'm here . What is it ? Um , there 's a phone call for you , sir . Very important . I ... I could take over for you here . A phone call ? Um , who is it ? Um ... Dr. Juarez . She said it 's urgent . She said that , um , she needs the population of the camp . Dr. Juarez ? When did she call ? Just now . Did you speak to her ? Yes , yes , I did . And this was when ? When exactly - was just now ? - Five minutes ago . - Esther ! Esther ! - Rex ? Esther , just run ! He killed Vera ! Esther ! [ SCREAMS ] Leave her alone , damn it ! Aaargh ! [ SHE SCREAMS ] Argh ! Agh ! Esther ! [ GASPS ] What happened ? - I killed ... I killed him . - No . Oh , my God , I killed him , Rex . No , no . You didn 't , OK ? Nobody dies , remember ? He 's just a Category 1 now . Now , look , stay with me . Come on , look at me . Look at me . I need you to go in his pocket and get the keys . - No . - Esther , we 've got to get out of here . Come on , stay focused . Get the keys . Go get the key . [ SHE SCREAMS ] [ GUNSHOT ] This has got to stop . Thank you ! Bloody hell ! - What do you think you 're doing ? - My job , isn 't it ? Don 't scare a man like that . Patient transfer at this time of night ? - I just do what I 'm told . - And exactly what were you told ? - Patient transfer , 5am . - Who told you this ? - My supervisor , who else ? - What 's his name ? Um ... Well , he 's got more authority than you , mate . He 's a captain . Captain Jack Harkness . He ordered me . That 's a bit odd . I don 't see a Harkness on our roster . I 'd better make some calls . [ WHISPERS ] Oh ... God ! [ WHISPERS ] Typical ! Not long now , Dad , I promise . Oh , hell to pay , Rhys Williams , if you don 't show . Hell to pay . [ M UTTERS ] Oh , mama ... - Can I go now ? - I don 't understand . They 've stopped movement orders until 6am , but you 've been given special instructions apparently . - Why 's that , then ? - Yeah , well , this Captain Harkness must have taken a shine to me . He had that look about him , if you know what I mean . Not that there 's anything wrong with that , of course ! Um ... Oh , look at the time . I 'm late enough as it is . I need to make another call . MAN : Did you hear , a boatload of Category 2s arrived in Cardiff last night ? One of those cruise ships full of British citizens from abroad . - All sick as dogs ? - Hell of a state . - Expelled from Europe like boat people . - Last thing we need is more patients . Come on , we 've got to get these Cat 1 s ready for transport . All right , Dad , I 'm getting you out of here ... now . Bless you . Where the hell were you ? ! I was on time , only this officious bastard held me up . Why didn 't you just run him over or something ? I 'm not the running-over type , Gwen , you know that . Anyway , I drove off when the silly bugger was on the phone . - He 's probably followed me . - One , two , three . OK , let 's get him . Gently now . - OK , I got you . - Ready , one , two , three . OK . Get going , then . Take Dad home . There 's something I 've got to do here first before I go to the States . You 're going back to America ? We 've got to find out what 's behind all of this and put a stop to it , once and for all . But before I do , I haven 't finished with this place yet . That 's him ! That 's him ! That 's him ! Hey , hey , hey ! Where 's my goodbye kiss , you big fool ? - Bye ... - Get going . Now , you hold it right there ! Get me the south gate . Here we go . MAN : Hey , you ! Hey ! - Fire ! - [ GUNFIRE ] I just hope someone 's listening . COMPUTER : Hello . Anybody home ? You 're a sight for sore eyes . Jack , is that you ? In the flesh . You OK ? Yes ... I know , Jack . I 'll be there soon . I 'm coming back to the fight . - To the fight . - We need you . But first , there 's something I 've got to show you . Record it for me , Jack . Oh , lovely . Jack , you watching ? I 'm here . And I 've opened up the radio link . Make your message . This is the truth for the whole world to see . We let our governments build concentration camps . They built ovens for people in our names . Now , I don 't care if the whole of society bends over and takes this like a dog , I 'm saying , " No . " That 's my girl . [ SIRENS WAIL ] Well , all the guards are gone . The regular army is coming in . They 'll shut it down . It was sanctioned ... by the government ... and they 've got my name . They 've got my name . I was on staff as Esther Drummond . Esther , listen , stop it , OK ? Just stop it . You saved me . I spent all that time wanting a job like yours . Look at me now . OK . It 's OK , you ... you 're allowed to feel like this . Come here . Listen to me . This is not over , not for Torchwood . And I need you in this fight . OK . So get it together and do it fast . OK . I 'm fine . I 'm ... I 'm ready . Yeah . [ GRUNTS ] Me too . TV : Flesh can bum . That 's the stark truth facing the world today . We 've known since Miracle Day that ﬂesh can still burn . But today there 's outrage ... We did it . We 're whistle-blowers . Every major news organization . The world knows the truth now . Let the outrage begin . You really think it 's that easy , huh ? The death of Vera Juarez demands a full investigation , but there will be no apology for the Category 7 process . Nam we ex / st in a permanent state of emergency . The White House stands by our disaster response as ... as appropriate and as sanctioned by Congress . This is exactly what we would do in times of a famine - or a plague or pestilence ... - REX : You see that ? They should be shutting down those camps right now . They 're just talking about it . At least we 've made it public . Torchwood wasn 't designed to fight politicians . If we really want to stop this happening , we need to look at the bigger picture , find out what the Blessing is . RHYS : Hello , I 'm not available , but please leave your name and number , and I 'll call you back as soon as I can . - [ SIGHS ] - Thank you ! Rhys , it 's me again . Um , I 've landed .

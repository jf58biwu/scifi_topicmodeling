 The last fragment of a once living planet . Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants while its head was cursed to rove aimlessly through time and space , screaming in pain and sorrow ... In legend and in fact it is known as ... Metal Hurlant . Where at am I ? You 're in my bomb shelter . You 're our neighbour ! Who my dad is always arguing with . - Mr Davis . - That 's right . I don 't understand . Why am I here ? There 's no way I can soften this . About four hours ago , a warning went out . A perage ( ? ) of nuclear missiles was headed toward us . I knew I had to get in this shelter and when I stepped outside I saw you in your yard . Wait a minute . - You ... You hit me ! - Yeah . I 'm really sorry about that , but there was no time to explain . And even if I had , you might not have believed me , or ... run off to find your family . - Dad ! - No . Jen ! Jen ! Jen , you can 't open that door ! Stop ! You don 't understand ! Jen ! Jen ! Listen to me . The missiles have already hit . They 're dead . Everyone is dead . Everyone ? It 's OK , I know it 's a lot to take in . Why don 't you sit back up ? Uh , I 'll get you some water . I , I know that it 's a lot to take in , but ... You ... You have to stay calm . Just take whatever time you need . Because time is the one thing we have plenty of . I 'm sorry if I kept you up last night . Oh , it 's all right . Do you feel any better ? Just numb at this point . What about us ? - Are we safe in here ? - Uhm ... We 're 10 feet under ground . The walls are concrete and lined with led . As long as that door remains closed ... the radiation can 't get to us in here . And now that I 've set the locks - the door ... only opens from the inside , so ... We 're safe . If we 're in here , how do you know the bombs went off ? Maybe it was a hoax ? After I got us in here , I 've ... turned on the radio . I was praying it was just a hoax . I listened to the reports as the first missiles hit ... After one station stopped broadcasting , I s ... scanned until I found another . Eventually , all the reports ... stopped . Have you tried today ? - Well , no . - Maybe somebody 's broadcasting again . Places the missiles didn 't hit , people in shelters , like us . I don 't know . How does it work ? Well ... You can , uh ... scan for frequencies using this ... these knobs . And you can also send out messages using the microphone . So if someone is out there , I can speak to them . Yeah . Thank you . There has to be someone out there . And I 'm gonna find them . Sure , you will . Is anyone out there ? Do you read me ? Do you read me ? Is anyone there ? If you 're there , please respond . Do you read me ? Jen ? Dinner 's ready ! If you 're there , please respond . You really need to eat . I miss you . Is anyone there ? Do you read me ? I must be doing something wrong . I went up and down the dial endless times , and no reponse . - Everything looks all right . - I 'll keep trying . No , you 've tried enough for one day . You need to eat and get some rest . There really could be no one out there . I 'm sorry . I know the last thing you wanted was to be trapped down in here with your creepy neighbor . You 're not creepy . I 'm sorry , my dad called you creepy . - Oh . - He was overprotective . He loved you . That 's what parents do . You 're the one who saved me . I know , I 've been an emotional wreck . I ... I just need some time to myself to ... process all of this . Probably wanna take a shower and get some rest . You will sleep on the bed , I 'll take the sofa . Thank you . Mr Davis ? Oh , I can 't believe I slept so late . You obviously needed it . How 'd you feel ? Better . It 's still overwhelming . But I 'm not as exhausted . Well , now what you need is some food . Mr Davis ... - Can I ask you a question ? - Go ahead . Why did you build a bomb shelter ? I built it for my wife . She , um ... She was a beautiful and intelligent woman . Uh ... but she worried about things . A great many things . Things that we as individuals have no control over . Is that why you built it ? To make her feel better ? Huh . So she knew we had some place safe to go if the missiles were ever launched . I never thought , I 'd actually use it . What happened to her ? Her worries got to be more than ... building a shelter could alleviate . You know , we got to the point where ... she lived her life afraid of everything . She never left the house . We ... We tried doctors and ... you know ... pills and ... but in the end , it was , it was just too much for her . You know , she took too many of her pills . I think about her every day . I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Actually , I think this is doing me some good . When you , you lose your wife , you ... People start to look at you differently . They either pity you or judge you for not protecting her . And , uh ... in both cases they stop talking to you . Friends , uh ... colleagues and neighbors . As if the loss of your loved one wasn 't enough . Is that why you and my dad fought ? No . That was a different reason . Your father saw me like that once staring at you . And all he saw was a ... creepy older man looking at his daughter . Really ? And from that point on he was wary of you ? Mhm . - Shit ! - Oh . Didn 't burn you , did it ? No , I ... I ... I don 't have anything to change into . Hold on . You 're the same size as my wife was . She 's got a box of her clothes over in the corner there . Must be something you can change into . - OK . - I 'll show you . Messy . It 's over here . The stuff has been here for a while , but , uh ... You should find something that works . I 'm gonna leave you alone . My dad should have got to know you and heard your story before he judged you . Well , I wasn 't exactly inviting him over to tea . I got very closed off after my wife died . Didn 't really talk to anyone . You 're talking to me . Yeah , it took the end of the world to get that to happen . I hope you don 't mind . I had to try it on . You look amazing . I wish I would have had this to wear to my prom . Jen . They 're gone . Nothing will ever be the same again . You know , one thing I can do to ... that would always cheer my wife up ... was to ... play some music and dance with her . # ' When You 're Smiling' by Louis Armstrong Music was emotion , she said . Good and bad . And ... the best way to deal with pain and with loss ... is to add your emotion to the music , and ... and let it all flow together . And when all that emotion comes together , it creates passion . And ... people can always use more passion . ♪ When you 're smiling ♪ The whole world ( smiles with you ) Your wife sounds amazing ! She was . - Mr Davis , I ... - Please call me Brad . I 'd rather die . You saved my life ! ♪ But when you 're crying It 's OK . ♪ You bring on the rain ♪ So stop your sighing , baby . ♪ And be happy again ♪ Yes , and keep on smilin ♪ Keep on smilin ' , baby ♪ And the whole world smiles ♪ with you Jen , wait . I don 't think we should do this . Please . I just got to feel something else . I just need to feel alive . Do we have any tea ? Yeah . Um ... In one of the boxes on the shelf in the pantry . Great . I 'll go make us both a cup . You really should 've labelled all of these . Wait ! Let me find it for you . It 's OK . I need to find where everything is . I 'll be down here a while . Oh my God . It 's me . They 're all of me . - What the hell are these ? - Uh ... Just calm down , please . Let me explain . Like you explained kidnapping me . Like you explained knocking me out , keeping me in your bomb shelter ! This is just some sick way of you getting me into your bed ! - No , I swear . - You got me ... ( ? ) it is sicker . ( ? ) - I 'm calling the police . - No ! You can 't open the door , Jen . I know what this all looks like , but I 'm telling you the truth . Can 't you see ? I love you . My dad was right about you all the time . No ! Jen , stop it ! Jen ! You kidnap me ! You tell me my family ( ? ) was dead . This is your idea of love ? No wonder your wife killed herself . Oh , psycho ! ( ? ) Damned psycho ! Keep me trapped ! Psycho ! Damned psycho ! Trying to keep me trapped . Oh my god . What 've I done ? I 'm sorry . Subtitles by : UAR

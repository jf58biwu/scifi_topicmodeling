In the computers in there , there 's no record of you . No birth certificate , no nothing . Do you remember your social security number ? - Yeah . - Tell it to them , and if it comes up on their computers , it won 't come out as you . I 've been able over time to create an identification that no one can dispute . I can teach you to survive . If you follow my instructions , you 'll never feel pain again . Let 's go inside . - Andrew , this can 't be happening , this can 't be real . - The first time I suffered through all this , I 've felt the same way you do now . Like you , I thought I was going crazy . I was seventeen . I heard a voice in my head , definitely thought I was going crazy . It was the voice of an old man . An old man pulling me into heaven . saving my life . - My dad ... or ... the man who looks like my dad , will he be in every world I go to ? - Every one you 've ever known in every world you go to . - Everybody ? - Yes . But they won 't know who you are . She 's exactly the same , everything you recorded about her . - Hi . - Hello . - I 'm ... thinking about applying for a job here . I was wondering if I could ask some questions about the place . - Sure . - Would you mind if I sit ? - Oh , uh , go ahead . So , what kind of work do you do ? - I can cook . - That 's good . Our cafeteria could really use some help around here . - Is something the matter ? - I feel like I 've seen you around somewhere . - I just moved here . - Anyway , um ... I ...

What are you doing with the knife ? - Shh ... shh ... - You need to absorb this monster 's energy . Feel better . - I feel ... - In peace . Like you never felt before . - This is wrong . Let me see if what kind of monster he was . How many more innocent people you think you would have killed if I hadn 't stopped them ? They even thought they could pay me to let them go . In every world I 've gone to , there 've been monsters like them . We might not be able to kill them all. huh ? And even the few we kill , will save a lot of innocent people . That 's the good thing to do . The old man taught me that I always had a couple of monsters tied up where nobody could find them . If you don 't keep me alive , I can 't keep you . - You 're not putting any sauce in yours ? - It 's not poisoned . - That much pasta ? - Got what I need . I 've lost the ability to taste and feel some things but other sensations have become even stronger . I can feel ... the ticking of the second hand like the beat of a heart . Enjoy what you can . I prepared the room down the hall for you to sleep in ... - [ indistinct ] - Ready . - Fire ... - Having trouble falling asleep ? - Yeah . - Music ? And something to read , always , huh ? Yeah , I ' ll give you something to read . Japanese soldiers . Killed more than a million Chinese civilians . Women and children among them . They believed they were doing it to protect Japan . To make their family safe at home . They dropped tons of incendiary bombs in Japan , burning more than a million Japanese civilians , women and children among them , telling ourselves that we were doing it to protect our country . To make America safe . this kind of thing has been going on for a long time . I know it 's difficult reading about those things , but it will toughen you up . Goodnight , Mark . - Goodnight . - I look terrible . - No , you don 't . - Yes , I do . I haven 't put on any makeup . Honey , you 're too early . - I look terrible . - No you don 't . Yes , I do . I haven 't put on any makeup . Honey , you 're too early . - I 'm sorry . - It 's OK . I 'm sure when my boss arrives he 'll let me leave as soon as I want . - We have to adjust our plan . - What happened ? - It turns out that there 's more work for me to do than I thought . There are things I need to do now . - Andrew are you trying to find a way to tell me that it 's over ? - No . - You don 't sound too convincing . - I 'm not sure of much , except that I love you . More than I could say . - I read all of it . Bad times . - They were . - So ... um ... Katherine 's gonna be getting off work , off her night shift in a few minutes , and I was wondering if ... uh I could go see her . Please . Morning . - Hi , uh ... you got the job here ? - Not yet . Actually , I ... uh ... still wanna see if I can ask you a couple of questions about this place . Can we get some breakfast ? Talk a little ? - Thanks , but I don 't think that 's a good idea . - Maybe another time ? - Probably not . That 's ... my boyfriend . Hey . - What 's up ? Babe , this is ... Mark , uh , he 's trying to get a job here . - Oh , how 's it going ? - Not so good . - Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that , man . There 's lot 's of jobs though . I 'm sure you 'll find something . Ready ? - Yeah . - Alright . Hope it works out for you . - You , too . - Bye . - Bye . - I know what you 're going through . In some worlds , the one I love liked someone else . In some ways ... ? The ? you had with them flied by and ... - And what ? - The day you enter their world , an illness starts in them . - No ... - Within a year , they die . - There has to be a way to keep Katherine alive . - If there was , I would tell you . I 've seen it happen , over and over . That 's why I told you that you have to toughen up , but ... - What 's--what 's wrong ? - I 'm losing my strength . You 're gonna have to drive . There 's the house . The man I tied up is in the garage . Look in his pocket . Check the phone . He killed her . Keep checking the phone . He killed her , too . Yes . He 's bleeding . He 's waking up , you 'll have to do it now . I die , you 'll die . cut his throat . - Andrew ... Andrew ... - You did the right thing . - Alright ... Yeah . I 'll bring cash , you make sure he gets the best ID possible . We 'll be there in about an hour . OK . What you thinking about , Mark ? - You have any kids ? - No . It 's impossible for people like me and you to have kids . But you gotta do what people like me and you gotta do and never stop focusing on the future . Keep your mind on possibilities . If you stay focused on possibilities , you can hang on . - I wanna go see my dad . The man who looks like my dad . Sir ... uh , I don 't ... I 'm not from here , I don 't know anybody yet . I 'd like to talk to you . - About what ? - I 'll ... I 'll be moving into an apartment down the street . - So ? - Sir , you remind me ... of somebody ... that tried to help me . I ... I still need help . Advice on ... all kinds of things . We could hang out at a bar , you know ... you pick the place , I 'll buy the beer . - I ... I don 't know what con you 're pulling , but if ... if you 're buying the beer , I 'll play along . - OK . Well , I 'll come by in a couple of days . - Alright . See you around . - Well , he 's not my dad , but ... he acts exactly like him . - When the old man pulled me into his world , I did just ... what you did . I went searching for the ones who looked like my family . I only found my mother . Of course , she didn 't know who I was , got scared , left the shack she was staying at . Alright . The energy we get from the monsters we kill slows down our aging . - What ? - Yes . Yes . I was born before the Civil War . Slave in an Georgia plantation , 1855 . - Wait , time out ... - Time out nothing . No time out for you . Let me finish before you start asking a lot of questions . Being born a slave in a Georgia plantation , horrible . Always something to fear . But my mom could always find a way to make us happy . And the Civil War came . And my mother had to work like an animal to keep us alive . And when the war worsened , she began to have to still do whatever else she could to keep us alive . One day , she found a knife in the burned down shack we were staying in . She told us " Don 't you leave this house until I come back tomorrow . " And when I get back did you leave ? And she left . And she came back the next morning . With food . She kept on going out with the knife , until the Civil War ended . Her eyes ... were always on something really far away . Something only she could see . Then I caught Tuberculosis and I began hearing the old man 's voice in my head . Until a man ... he took me out of my world into his world . Saved my life . I 'm telling you this because I 've seen worse . I 've seen wars , I 've seen massacres , I 've seen famine , but you know what ? I 've also seen how fiercely people have struggled to stay alive , just with a hope of a better future . The day you enter the world , an illness starts . Within a year , they die . - No ... - Help us ... help us ... - What now ? - Kill him . - Kill him . - Kill him . - No ... - You need to absorb this monster 's energy . How many more innocent people do you think you would have killed if I hadn 't stopped you ? In every world I 've gone to , there 'd been monsters like him . - No ... No ... Good morning . - You get any sleep ? - Not much . - That 's something else you 're gonna have to get used to . Coffee helps . Want some ? - Sure . Thanks . - Want milk in your coffee ? - Ah , no , thank you . - I 've made it a little bit too strong . Uh ... Milk 's gonna make it taste a lot better . - I 'd like just a little bit , then . Hmm ... - Still too strong ? - No , it 's good . Mark , tonight my year will be up . I 'll get pulled out of this world , into another world . You and I will never see each other again . There 's something different you have to do to stay alive in this world and make it into another world . - Something different ? - Yes . I can 't keep my eyes open . What did you put in this ? - Just something that will help you sleep a bit . - Andrew , I trusted you . - The old man told me that people like you ... and me and all the people that go from world to world are all the same . We have the darkness in us that make us capable of doing horrible things . When we enter a new world , our dark side merges with the darkness of the monsters we kill to the energy of people like Katherine , and Gloria . People that don 't mean anybody any harm . In order to stay alive , we need their energies . - Andrew , please ... there has to be another way . - The old man tried to tell me there was another way but he was lying . He began to love the killing . And when he found out I didn 't like the killing , he tried to kill me . But I killed him first . - You 're a monster . - Maybe . - Hey babe . Welcome back . - I 'm glad to be back . - You sound tired . Honey ? - I 've been working a lot . - I really missed you . - I miss you , too . - OK . I 'll see you soon , OK ? - See you . - Baby what 's wrong ? - Just thinking about how much I have to do . Let 's go get some coffee - OK . - Is something the matter ? - No . - Andrew , open your mind . - No ... No ... no ... no ... - This will only stop if you 're feeling pain . - No ... Please ... Please . Help me please . No , no , no , no , no ... - This will impair you for about a minute , then you get your strength back . Get up . - Don 't do this . - Come on , there 's no other way . - What about Gloria ? - Do you think I enjoy killing the ones I love ? I told you . The minute we enter their world , they begin to die . And they die a horrible death . - How many times have you seen that happen ? - Happens to all of them . Pick up ... the knife all it takes is a cut across Katherine 's shoulder . That 's all you need to do . Time is running out . This is the last time I 'm going to ask you . Do it . - OK . I 'll do it . - The knife is on the floor . Pick it up . - OK . OK ... God ... I got the knife . - Cutting quickly , she won 't feel too much pain . - Katherine ... Katherine , listen to me . - I 'm sorry . Let him go ... Let him go . Let him go . Look , look at me , Look at me ... You 're not gonna do this . Andrew , you 're dead . You can 't feel anything . - I am not . Unfortunately I can feel all sorts of things . - Andrew , please , please . The old man could be telling the truth . - The old man was lying . - You don 't know that for sure . Close your eyes , Gloria . Please close your eyes . - Andrew ... Andrew , please . Please ... - I hope the old man was telling the truth . About there being another way . I 'm tired of killing . Mark , we 're in a new world . You have to wake up . - Good morning , darling . Thank you for a lovely evening . Let 's get you outside and put you to bed . Huh ... you should have seen your face . You should have seen your face . - We 're not absorbing his energy . - American realty , how may I help you ? - I 'm looking for a house to lease . - OK . Well , you 've called the right place . My name is Gloria . I only offer the best in quality . So , how long a lease are you looking for ? - Let 's start with a year . Could I come by your office tomorrow ? - Sure , um ... well , what time works best for you ? - 9 AM . - 9 AM it is , Mister ... - Andrew James . - 9 AM , Andrew James . OK . I look forward to seeing you tomorrow . Thank you . - What happened to Katherine ? - I don 't know . We 're in a new world . I don 't know what the rules are out here . - Is there another Katherine here ? - Probably . I just talked to another Gloria . - I wanna see Katherine . I won 't ... I won 't be any trouble , I swear . Do you think it 'll hurt her if I Ger too close ? - I don 't know . I don 't know how long she 'll live , how long you 'll live , or how long I 'll live . I don 't know . - There 's someone else I wanna see . it 's like they 're all ... in this world . - Yes . - I guess it means those ... those other ones are here , too . - I 'm pretty sure I know why the old man never wanted to try the new one . he would have died . Like I 'm dying . - What ? Wait . What ? No . - Go ... do whatever you want in the time you have left . Beautiful . Thank you . - You 're not gonna die . - I am . If my memories enter you ... I am down as quickly as you can . Before I forget . I 've already forgotten most of your memories . I always told myself that I had to kill the ones I loved to save many more . Now I finally see the truth about myself . I so loved being alive . Even though ... . I could barely feel much of anything . It was the things I loved that kept me going . Horrible world . Hold on to what you love then you 'll hang on . I hope you live long enough to see all the things I 've seen . All of the beauty . - Scott Fletch . Scott Fletch ?

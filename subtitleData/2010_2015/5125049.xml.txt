 Come on , milk run . I said I didn 't want to drive a bus , now he 's gonna me driving a frakking delivery truck . Yeah , only thing better is if they could make it a regular trip , say for the next month or so . - You 're really getting out ? - Like a shot , kid . And go back to what ? Where ? Who cares ? As long as it 's far away from here . Excuse me , Captain ? Captain Tornvald ? Sir ? I just wanted to say I 've been following your record since you first joined the Squadron . Someday I hope to be half the pilot you are . I 'll let you in on a little secret , kid . It 's bullshit . All of it . Awesome . And then , I think he 's gonna bust us and he says : You know what ? I 'm gonna send you on a godamn milk run . That 's it . We 're going out . Two days out , two days back . - You gonna lay over ? - Hell yeah . They got real booze over there . None of this watered-down pruno . Sounds like you two have booked a bona fide pleasure cruise . Yeah , tell that to young , dumb , itching to get his ass shot off over there he 's still crying his eyes out . What do you expect , Coker ? Our young thane wants to make a name for himself . Isn 't it why we 're here ? Kill the enemy ? Destroy the frakking machines before they destroy us . Kid , we all know why we 're here . Don 't be in such a rush , okay ? I think that 's my towel . See anything you like , rook ? - Hydraulic reservoir ? - Full . Cap secure . Front dradis antenna ? Almost . Ha 'la 'tha ? My dad 's a lawyer . Yeah ? Mob lawyer ? Defense attorney . - What 's it to you ? - I 'm just saying . That could have rangled a pass on this old frak ass is pretty easy . Is that what you would have done ? - Find a way out of the war ? - Nobody gave me a choice . - What the hell is this ? - Your ordnance package . - What 's it look like ? - It looks a little light to me . I see a full set of com drones , missile decoys , - and what , 2 Archers ? - We 're short on air-to-airs . Ordnance Chief says two . You got a problem , take it up with him . I 'll take it up with him . I 'm more concerned with our cargo . Can you give us an exact weight ? Why don 't you ask it yourself . She 's our cargo ? - We already met . Right ? In the ... - In the shower . You 're a pilot ? Civilian . I 'm a software engineer . Bill Adama . Pilot . Nice to meet you . Welcome aboard , anyway . Like I said I 'm your pilot . This is my co-pilot and ECO , lieutenant ... Fasjo ... Coker is fine . You look kinda young for a pilot , are you any good ? - So they tell me . - You believe everything they tell you ? Why don 't we get going ? Assuming this piece of shit can actually fly . Raptor 9-0-9 you 're clear for departure . Good afternoon , this is your captain Bill Adama . Our flight time to Scorpion is approximately two days , during which we hope to encounter absolutely nothing . Fortunately , you 'll find a wide range of fine Holoband entertainments to help you pass the time . For now , please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened and thank you once again for flying Wild Weasel airlines . - Like that ? - Lovely . You 're wasting your charms , such as they are . - I know her type . - What type is that ? As far as she 's concerned , we 're just the hired help . Oh hello . Are we still in Dradis range of Galactica ? Good . If you 'll open this , you 'll find a new set of orders . Give me that . - What the hell is this ? - Open it and you 'll find out . - These are from the Admiralty . - As you can see , it specifies a new set of coordinates for a rendezvous with the heavy cruiser Archeron . No , that 's two days in the wrong direction . That is sector 12 . Right on the edge of Cylon controlled space . No way we 're gonna make it alive . No frakking way . I 'm calling Galactica . - No , you 're not . - Excuse me ? The orders specify wireless silence . That means no contact with Galactica or any other Colonial ship or outpost . It also states you are both to follow my orders . So , let 's get started . We have a lot of space to cover . - What are you grinning at ? - " Milk run . " Milk run , my ass . Dammit ! You 're having trouble with your band ? Let me have a look . You know how to fix them ? I used to work for the company that designed them . You worked for Graystone Industries ? I worked on Cylons . I designed the upgrade on their MCP chips . - That 's their ... - Their brain , I know . In other words , you helped improve the machines that are killing us . Better get up here . We 're approaching the rendezvous coordinates . Husker ! - Dradis ? - Clear . Here we go . Colonial transponder . Good . Hold on . - I 'm reading multiple signatures . - Maybe Archeron have support ships . Where the hell are their transponders ? - Something wrong with this picture . - Break radio silence and hail them . Archeron , this is Raptor 9-0-9 . Acknowledge and respond . Try again . Archeron , this is Raptor 9-0-9 . Acknowledge and respond . Gods ! Is that Archeron ? Got your answer ? Get back there and sit down , strap yourself in . Now ! This is unbelievable . Must 've been an ambush . Nobody could have survived this . Three enemy contact . Incoming . Got one Raider inbound on our starboard side . - Visual . Where are the other two ? - I don 't know . Targeting . Dammit . Auto-targeting isn 't responding . Can you get the helmets please ? - Switching to manual . - We must not engage the enemy ! The godsdamn enemy engaged us We can 't outrun ' em with this bird ! Come on !

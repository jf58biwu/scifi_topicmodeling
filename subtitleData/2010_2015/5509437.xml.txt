Whatever punishment you dish , I can take it as much as you 're willing to give . Of course I have to take it . Saying I wanted to live alone , what can I say when I abandoned my brother and mother ? No matter what you do , I can take it all . Except let 's not be apart again . Just that one thing ... Just let me have that one thing . Hey ... this is nice . Isn 't it ? Should I go ? Thailand . I 'll go . You stay here and ... No . I have to go . Myung Choon , I ... How long has it been between us ? Has it been about ten years ? What 's ten years ? From over there , crossing Thailand , all the way to Busan beach , Yah , we have stuck together so long . Huh ? So what I am saying is that this time after you get back just quit everything and focus on Chul . You don 't have to worry about me , its just that ... I don 't know . Hi ! Nice to meet you . Come here . Sit down . Where is the boss ? The boss does not feel good , he will be late . Relax . Sit down . Please . Where 's the money ? The boss will be here soon . I bought you a gift too . Tae Min ah . Go after him . Go after him . ... ... - empty ... ... - Hello . Yes , Its Hyuk . Why is you phone number like that ? Huh ? I 'm somewhere far away right now . I 'd like to ask for a favor . Let 's talk money first . Then I 'll do whatever you ask . Detective Park . What ? About Chul ... Chul ... what about him ? My little brother Chul ... Next time you see him ... Why are you talking like that ? What 's the matter ? Where are you ? Hyuk ! I ... Tell him I 'm sorry . That I ... Really didn 't run away . That I will go find him ... I asked you where you were . Hyuk ! I surrender ! I surrender ! I surrender ! There 's no such thing as loyalty here . So , teach them a lesson . Hey . Hey ! Hey ... stop ! Hey ... stop ! Hyung . Whether you want it or not ... It doesn 't matter . Just one thing ... I 'm going to show them who we are . Happy now ? I am writing a letter after much hesitation . Dear Park I 'm sorry . You loved me like a father would and you understood me . I 'm sorry . I 'm very sorry . To you and to Chul ... I don 't even have the right to ask for forgiveness . . Glad you came . You underwent many hardships . Hyuk , the thing you 're wondering most is probably about Chul . Chul graduated the academy and he 's doing very well with us . My grandmother loves him like her own grandson . He 's adjusted well . He says he wants to be a police officer and he 's studying hard . When I asked him why he wanted to be a cop , he said there 's someone he really wants to catch . Even though I here his words I wonder if its his emotions talking . I 've given your letters to Chul . Three years later Ok . I understand . I 'll be there after I grab some coffee . Ok . I 'm hanging up . You jerk , you jerk aish . Cut to the chase , they 've already confessed you 're selling guns . Where 'd you get the guns from ? Why are you doing this ? I found it . We have all the evidence of you doing it right here . You piece of shit ! ... ... - empty ... ... - You piece of shit ! Stop messing around ! Aigoo , please stop this . ... ... - empty ... ... - Good luck , he 's a waste of time . You want one ? No thanks . ... ... - empty ... ... - Have you ever killed anyone before ? Why are you being like this , really ? ! You ever eat human meat ? Wh ... what are you doing right now ? When I was in North Korea , my best friend got sick and was dying . His only wish was to eat meat once before he died . So what should I do ? I sold my bike and bought a bunch of meat and we ate until our stomachs were about to explode . But , maybe because he got his wish he died two days later . While I was crying during the funeral wake some strange man came and said to sell him the corpse so they could use it as a cadaver in China . So I sold it . For someone who had no family all he would do is rot away if I buried him . Am I right ? Just because I got some money in my pocket I wanted to eat meat . So I went back out to the outdoor market . The man who I sold the corpse to was selling meat . There were barrels full . I can 't forget the taste of it . Should I eat you too ? No one would no if a piece of scum like you disappeared . I sold it ! I sold it ! What ? ! ? Guns ... I sold the guns . Boss , you 're here . You did a good job . I just did my job . Hey ... Lucia ... What ? If you 're finished , shouldn 't you turn yourself in ? If you don 't like it you should die . For someone like you who 'll shoot anyone for money , if someone paid you , wouldn 't you shoot me ? No I wouldn 't . I would never shoot you boss . No I wouldn 't . ... ... - empty ... ... - All of you . Why are you doing this . Please don 't kill me . ... ... - empty ... ... - This is the shooting incident in Pusan . This is the 3rd such incident in Pusan this year . The victim Lee Yong Gil was found to have Russian guns in his car as well . Jung Tae Min was found three years ago to have started a relationship with the Russian mafia and seems to have grown this business . All incidents of shootings in Pusan seems to be linked to this man . Lee Yong Choon is an ex-patriot of North Korea . He 's better known as a gun smuggler but the real source is this man . His name is Kim Hyuk . 3 years ago he was arrested after a gun fight in Thailand . We are still trying to locate his whereabouts . We don 't need to find his whereabouts . Its about when he 'll show up . He should be coming back soon . Did you not know ? Is that piece of shit still tailing us ? Yes . Stop the car . What are you doing ? Where do you think you 're going ? Don 't worry about me and go about your business . What 's my business ? There 's a lot . Drugs , prostitution , gun smuggling and you kill people . Right ? Is there more ? Then why don 't you stop following me and take me away in handcuffs you piece of shit . Its going to happen so shut your mouth and go about your business fucker . Listen , For over a year you follow me and you can 't pin anything on me . Isn 't that incompetent ? If not , I must be that good . Learn how to compliment someone instead of just using curse words . How is it that two brothers could be so alike ? So pathetic . Jung Tae Min . Stop right there . I can 't hear you . If you have something to say come here and say it . Stop there ! Listen to me closely you piece of shit . Kim Hyuk and I are not brothers , Understand ? ! ? You 're late yet again . What 's with your appearance ? Its good seeing you . You bad kid ! Bad .. What makes you think you can come here ? You bad kid ! Go away ! Go ! I said go ! I forgot the kimchee stew . Hey , hey , hey ... sit . You 've been missing this kimchee stew , haven 't you ? You should see Chul . You ugly kid . You should meet and let Chul say whatever he wants to say and if he hits you , just take it . Also , your house that sold , I put it all in your bank account . Chul said he wouldn 't take any of it . And Chul 's address , its in there too . Go see him . Afterall , you went through a lot for the two of you to be reunited . You can 't just live apart . If its someone you need to see , then you need to see him . Where is Yong Choon ? You should forget about Yong Choon . Hey , hey . If I give you work to do , you 're supposed to do it right . You can 't even do one thing right . Forget it you idiot . Ahjusshi ! Ahjusshi ! Aren 't you going to pay me ? Aigoo ... Here , take it ! There ' something to be said about the taste of this . This is so good . What happened ? Huh ? Just put out a fire , That 's it . This is so sweet isn 't it ? This is how alcohol is supposed to taste . Ah ... I 'm going to show you something killer . Look ... take a look . What do you think ? Its what we always dreamed of since way back . Get away to a place like that after you get paid ... Then you could just die . That 's it then . Who knew things would work out , with you coming back ? This is good luck . Pretty soon , Tae Min is going to be meeting with the Russians and we 'll ambush them . What is this ? First of all , let 's go to the hospital . And then after that , Hyung ! Don 't be like this . I 'm not dead yet and I still have dreams . Do you know why I stuck it out and lived here ? Yong Choon , I don 't want to live like the way I used to . Shit , really ! You 're looking down on me right now . Me ... You show up after you 've been away for 3 years and is this all I get ? ... ... - empty ... ... - Don 't make me laugh . The old Lee Yong Choon ... I 'm not dead yet . Should I show you ? Should I show you ? Do you know how long I 've been living with this close by me ? Do you know what I had to endure for you ? Do you know ? Maybe after finding your brother , that 's all you need . But me , Take care . Let 's get rid of Yong Choon . Wha .. what ? Are you crazy ? If we just keep letting him be like we 've been doing he could be a liability if law enforcement were to get involved . Tae Min everything is good . Everything is good . But letting this be is good . And having been this successful . Hyuk and Yong Joon had something to do with it too . So let 's just be good ... President Jung ... I 'm going to tell you this . If you ever say anything about Hyuk or Yong Choon in front of me again I 'm going to sever all family ties with you . Yong Hee , let 's go . Yes sir . Where did I go wrong ? I would like to know the reason . I 've been tailing Jung Tae Min for a whole year . Its making me feel like its all for nothing . I 'm telling this to you for your well being . To put it more precisely , for the well being of your brother . You 're officially off this case effective immediately . You 're excused . I don 't think of myself as Kim Hyuk 's brother . He 's felon and someone that needs to be arrested and brought in . Is that right ? I have an eye for people who lie to me . People who lie and betray others , I know very well because I 've experienced it too . Kim Chul for someone like yourself who 's never betrayed anyone , do you think you could understand your brother ? Take a look at this . After you look at this , what you choose to do with your brother is your business . Do whatever you want . Once you discover what 's in there you 'll see what 's really in your heart . Why do you keep showing up ? Sorry . Hyung nim ... sorry . Hyung nim . You should take this with you . Move along . So we going to do this or not ? ( speaking Russian ) The reports the police have you under surveillance , they know this too . Hey retard , just because of that ... So what ? This month ? Next month ? He 's saying at least 3 months . Boss ... Shouldn 't we delay the shipment ? Things aren 't good right now . I 've got my own plans . Yes , I 'm on my way . Yes . Please wait a little longer . Yes , yes . I understand . Yes , I 'm on my way over there . Yes . I 'm here . I don 't see you . Where are you ? I can see you very well . What 's the problem ? Behind , behind you . I call for delivery . Do you have anything against me ? You should give me the opportunity to explain the misunderstanding . At least come in . I 'll make things right . I 've gone straight . It doesn 't matter if I take that seriously right ? That 's not it . You don 't have to worry about me . Or nervous either . Crazy ... Well I 'm going to be frank with you . You need to help us . This is something that shouldn 't be refused and my hands are tied . Our Chul because you were gone I was very sad . But thanks to your brother , a lot changed . Get out of the car ! Until now , you don 't know why I 've ruined my life ? Because I 've betrayed someone , I even understood someone like you . The moment you mess with my brother you 're going to die . Oh , you 're here . - Yes . - Eat something warm . Eat some more . Here . Here 's some soup . Even though things are rough you have to make sure you eat . Want some soju ? Aigoo ... who is this ? Its Chul . Aigoo ... why is it so hard to see you ? Have you eaten ? Go sit down . I bring you some food . What are you guys doing ? ! Is this how brothers eat ? ! ? Tae Min ah . Do we really have to do this ? If we 're 3 months behind we 're going to lose hold of the market . Once the job is done , leave Chul to me . All you 're worried about is Hyuk and you 're not taking Yong Choon seriously . I don 't this that 's it . He 's only his leg is crippled but his hand isn 't . And doing this without covering your back ... Yong Choon that guy , is more dangerous than Hyuk . You saw it too right ? Weren 't you the one who said you know because you 've dealt with lies and deceit right ? Is this what you 're made of ? Kim Chul is off this case . As you were . Who is this ? Hyuk . How long has it been ? Come sit down . What are you doing standing there . No one is going to bite . Ah , sit down . Come outside . What are you doing now ? What me ? Did you not understand what I said to you ? What are you guys doing ? Come back inside and talk . Hyuk and Yong Choon , I 'm going to speak honestly . Our shipment is behind right now . Just think of this as an opportunity and just help me this one time . I don 't do this kind of work anymore . What if . Yong Choon says he 'll do it ? This is getting frustrating . Hyung nim , I think you need to understand . Because he was trying to seek revenge for you his leg got like that ... You want to die ? Keep your mouth shut . Are you stupid ? Say something ! What am I to you ? Because of me ... It was my choice . To hyung , it doesn 't matter . Shit ! Why is living so hard ? It was obvious what I had to do . If I didn 't , it would 've been embarrassing for us . I 'm leaving . What are you ? What are you , you bastard ? What kind of agreement did you make ? What are you doing with Jung Tae Min ? Chul , its not what you think . Don 't say my name with that dirty mouth you worthless piece of trash . Trash ? This person is your older brother . I said he 's your older brother . The only one older brother you have in this world . But trash ? Trash ? Is your older brother trash ? Apologize . Apologize , you jerk ! Lee Yong Choon ... Watch your mouth . You think I 'm going to listen to you ? Shoot me . Shoot me now . Stop it . Try and shoot me . Stop it ! Detective Kim ... I don 't do that kind of work anymore . Now that you 've become a cop , now that you 've become an upstanding person , I 'm so happy and apologetic . I 'm very happy . I don 't do that kind of work anymore . Please believe me . Son of a bitch . Look at those retards . Yah , why did you come here ? You 're hungry , right ? Ah , this jerk , really . What about Detective Park ? I told him to go get some rest at the sauna . How is it ? Is there any movement ? If Chief Jo knows you 're here , I 'm gonna get it too . There . That pencil neck ... Here goes nothing . Turn some music on . This is tiring ... tiring . Everyone 's well ? Yeah . They 're eating me out of house and home . Do you know what the opposite of a cop is ? Its family . Its 500 times better having them than not having them . Do well , you jerk . Ah , but where is this jerk going ? Ah , oh yeah . Did you want to see the letter Sun Chan wrote ? He wrote it masterfully . Check the envelope in the back . - Its back there ? - Yeah . It looks like even Sun Chan is all grown up . His mother ... Aigoo . There seems to have been an accident . What should we do ? Detective Yong ... Detective ... Hyung ! What is this ? What are we going to do about what 's happened ? Ok Chul ... What happened ? Tae Min did this didn 't he ? I killed him . I was supposed to die . He died instead . I could 't save mom either . No . You and I are different . I 'm going to ask you for a favor . Let 's end this . Please disappear . You want me to call you hyung then I 'll call you that . Let 's not have to see each other again for any reason . Hyung ! Hyung nim . You were so cool back then . But what is this now ? If it was me , I 'd kill myself . Hyung nim , you remember this right ? What , way back when , you gave this to me . But come to find out , this is a fake . I knew it then . But I didn 't throw it away and I kept it . Why ? Because I used this to build my dream . Why ? To show that Lee Yong Choon is a fake and Jung Tae Min is real . All thanks to you , Kim Hyuk Lee Yong Choon I 'm above all of you . Understand ? Its okay . We 're okay . Where are you going ? If you crumble because of something like this . Grandma and I won 't ever see you again . Yong Choon ... Yong Choon ! Yong Choon ! What happened ? Get a hold of yourself . Yong Choon . Yong Choon ! Get a hold of yourself ! Yong Choon ! What do you think I should do ? Hyuk . Do you feel like you owe me ? You don 't owe me anything . And besides , I 've given it all up too . Tae Min , that bastard won 't let it go . He 's crazy . Look at my face . Now that I 've decided to start a new life , I feel so good and at ease . Be healthy . See you tomorrow . Hey .. Its the cripple ! Where are you limping off to ? Hyung nim . Open it . I don 't have a key . What are you doing ? ! ? Open the door ! Open it ! Open the door ! Go downstairs ! Catch him ! Yong Choon , get in ! What is this ? What is the meaning of this ? I told you I was nervous about what you were doing . What is this ? What kind of person are you ? If you can 't find the ledgers ... You talk too much . Shit . Hyung nim . Why are you doing this ? Giving you what you deserve is all . Have you looked at the ledgers ? In there , the name found in there the most isn 't mine but its yours . Hyung , let me have the phone . Is that Lee Yong Choon ? Why do you talk so much ? Bring $ 1 million in cash . Understand ? Mom , all of dad 's friends are here but why isn 't dad here ? Yes . What ? Are you saying we need to get out there ? Who said that ? All of us ? We 're on our way . What are they doing ? Where are you going ? Hey Chul ! Someone once said , From the sky , it looks like a graveyard here . Then we did good surviving here . Now this is really the end . In 20 minutes the boat is going to be waiting . This is really going to be goodbye . Fuck , he sure brought a lot of them with him . The weather 's nice . Don 't you think ? Stop acting and bring the money . You should give that to me . You playing with me you son of a bitch ? ! All of it ? I gave it to the police . You think you 're going to get out of here alive ? I have no intention of leaving here alive . Just as long as I kill you . Sshh ... Stop . Put the guns down . Put down the guns ! After them ! Don 't tell them you heard it from me but Kim Hyuk said he 'd turn over . Jung Tae Min . Well after he said that , things got crazy and everyone left . But you better not come . The phone is turned off . Please leave a message Hyung nim , why are you doing this ? Hurry up and get on . What are you doing ? Go first . I still have some unfinished business . Aish ! Hyuk . Hyuk ! What the hell are you trying to do right now ? You think I 'm going to stay here and die by myself ? I 'll be right behind you . Aish ! Shit , I don 't know . What are you doing ? Its time we end this . Whether you die or I do . I have no plans to die . Stay put ! Get him . Weren 't we the only people who were going to die ? Hyung nim ! Looks like he 's going to die with you . Let him go . He 's saying let him go . You two brothers are both going to die here . Kill them ! Kill them ! Why did you come here ? ! Chul , are you okay ? Where were you trying to run off to by yourself ? Die ! I 'm not going anywhere . Shit ! Kill them ! Son of a bitch ! Over here ! Chul ! Are you okay ? Hyuk ! Sons of bitches ! Sons of bitches ! What are you doing ? Look ! Look ! Take a look ! Take a good look at your brother 's face ! What do you feel when you look at his face ? Because he thought you 'd get hurt or die ..

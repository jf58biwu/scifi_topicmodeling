 Yes sir . I understand completely , sir . Things go that way sometimes . Yes , sir , I will . You can count on me . Kids , come on out . - Time for deployment gifts . KIDS : Coming . DARIEN : Photos , videos and playlists . Not as good as a warm body in your bed , but it 'll have to do until I see you again . Darien , I 'm not going to the Med . Navy 's sending us to the Arctic . The Arctic ? That 's crazy . Some cold weather test on a new weapons system . It 's all classified . It 's happening fast . We 're going to be at complete radio silence . No e-mails , no calls . ASHLEY : For how long ? Six months , maybe five . Figures . It 's my last tour for a while . Then I 'll be around so much you 'll be sick of me . I promise . Sit down . - Did you wrap this yourself ? - I did . It 's from the championship game . Keep it next to your bed . I love it , buddy . It 's really great . Thank you . [ CHANDLER SIGHS ] - It 's beautiful . ASHLEY : It 's not regulation ... so I know you can 't wear it . How about I keep it in the front pocket of my uniform , right over my heart . MAN [ OVER RADIO ] : I need help if anyone out there can hear me . I 'm just outside ... WOMAN [ OVER RADIO ] : My children need help , please . If you can hear me ... [ PEOPLE CONTINUE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO ] [ DOOR OPENS ] CHANDLER : Sent the guys on a break . Figured I 'd see what 's going on in the outside world . It 's a lot of static . Whatever you might hear out there is not going to be particularly uplifting . My dad had an old ham radio set in his cabin . I thought maybe if Darien was ... It 's our anniversary . You never come down here . - I don 't think Christine 's looking for me . - Come on . Before we left , things were pretty ragged between us . When I finally got her on the phone after we lifted EMCON , she told me about Lucas . Losing a son is one thing , dealing with it on your own is just ... There was nothing you could do . That is not what she wanted to hear . I 'll leave you to it . There 's still a chance , Mike . For all of us . MAN 1 : Jordan ! MAN 2 : Oh , yeah . Sharp ! [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] MAN 3 : I 'm open ! Exactly what I want . Come on , Miller , I thought you could hoop . - Yeah , I can . - You can , huh ? Oh , man . That was our last ball . Nice , buddy . GATOR : So why Costa Rica ? Dr. Scott 's going to need primates to test her vaccine . Apparently there 's a monkey reserve upriver . But she doesn 't have the vaccine , does she ? She 's working on it . Meanwhile , we move forward . Hey - You think there 'll be a beach ? I could really use a beach right now . CHUNG : What ? What the hell is this ? Wasn 't this on the list to be rebuilt ? Yes , sir . The chief engineer put the HT 's on it , but we 're out of parts . They 're cobbling everything from scratch . She 's in medical . It 's on me now if the gasket blows . No one gets off watch until it 's done . [ ENGINE RUMBLING ] Does anybody hear that ? - Hear what , sir ? - She 's not purring . This is the mess decks ... for the enlisted in here . You 'll probably take your meals in the wardroom . Man , these are some cramped quarters . I don 't know how you all do it . Four months you 've been on this ship now ? - Almost five . - Five ? Wow . Ma 'am . Whoa . She is tasty now . Is she not ? Oh , lighten up dude . I 'm just saying . It 's the end of the world , right ? Nothing wrong with spreading a little love around . - I ain 't Navy so ... - Yeah , well they are . Which means no fraternizing , period . Well , I get it . Hey , um ... where 's the lab ? I 'm going to pay a visit to that scientist . She 's a civilian , right ? - Can 't believe I have to bunk with you . - Heh . Seriously , where 's the lab ? I need to finish the sequence analysis of three virus strains ... primordial , Egyptian , and the sample from the cruise ship . Do what you gotta do , but do it alone . I 'm not letting him back in that lab . Believe me , Quincy is that last person I want to see , but I need him . And we 're right on the verge here . That man tried to infect this entire ship . You 're not listening to me . This is one procedure that I cannot do alone . What about Doc Rios ? I 'm sure that he is an excellent ship 's doctor . But I need a highly trained expert in bio-informatics just for a few hours . I promise that I won 't let him near anything that could endanger the ship . What do you want ? I manage the sequencing . All three strains . Wasn 't sure I was gonna be able to do it with the equipment on hand , but the data is in . And you need me to analyze it . Yes . Look , Quincy , I am sorry for you and for your family . For Kelly ... and Eva , of course . I know there 's nothing I can say , but I also know you understand the world needs us ... Please don 't preach to me , Rachel . I 've had it up to here with your high-mindedness . I 'm not preaching ... The world needs you , that 's the way you like it . Quincy , what are you talking about ? I know you 're in pain here but ... I told you we should share information , that sneaking off to the Arctic ... wasn 't the way to do this , but you loved the whole " top secret " thing ... - That 's not fair because ... - Go it alone and show how smart you are . SCOTT : Quincy , where is this coming from ? This plague is the best thing that 's ever happened to you . Rachel Scott saves the day ! - This is not my fault . - No , it 's mine . For following you . I mean , what were you risking really ? You 've got no family . You 've got no friends . Truth is , you don 't have any skin in the game . You have no idea what I have lost . A guy who pops into town for a twice-monthly screw doesn 't count . You don 't know about loss , because you don 't care about anyone but yourself . Where the hell do you get off thinking your pain is greater than anyone else 's ? There 's a whole ship full of people out there who 've lost just as much as you ... and yet they keep finding a way to march on , but you ... you 're a coward . Nothing more . Probably a great deal less . Diplomacy not necessarily your strong suit . I can 't even look at him . You said you can 't do it without him , so we have to get him on board , right ? You do it . You talk to him . I 'm not that good with people any ... What on earth is that ? Bridge , this is MPA . We 've got high temperature on one and two generators . Commencing stage one load shed . Tell Captain Chandler that we need A / C and power , or everything will be lost . And hurry ! Damn it . No , that 's not it ! Trace the line . - Can 't run at this temperature , we 'll overheat . - Pull the filters . Let 's see what 's going on . Whoa ! Damn it ! [ ALARM BLARING ] Fire , fire , fire . Class Bravo fire , Main Engine Room Two . Away the at-sea fire party , provide from repair five . DCA , it 's the captain . What 's the status ? I say again , DCA , what is the status ? [ ALARM RINGING ] [ COUGHING ] Mr. Chung ! Everybody okay ? - Yes , sir . The fire 's out . - What 's our sitrep ? It started in the seawater surface system intake , sir . Something must 've torn off the filters ... - and sea life bloom got in ... - That 's on me . We cut it tight out of Gitmo . - Corals knocked off the filters . How bad is it ? - It 's too soon to tell , sir . But with the intakes down , we 've lost our ability to cool the engine oil for the mains . What about the generators ? Did they survive ? Just generator three , sir . And we 're lucky it was offline during the time . I want all the electricity diverted to the CIC and Dr. Scott 's lab under any circumstance . She needs that room cooled . You understand ? - Aye , sir . Sorry , sir . - Don 't be sorry . - Let 's just get it fixed . - Yes , sir . [ ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS POWER UP ] [ SIGHS ] Thank you . Thank you . - Captain 's on the bridge . - Reports . RO systems down for now , let 's initiate conservation . Salt water shaving only , no showers . Water strictly used for cooking and drinking . It 's gonna be 100 degrees today . I 'd like to reduce manning at all watch stations ... and suspend all non-essential activities . Good . Meanwhile , I 've got other fish for you to fry . SLATTERY : Good . I didn 't wake you . [ SLATTERY SIGHS ] A hot one , huh ? Reminds me of August in Chicago . It 's where I 'm from . You know that ? Yeah , I was a cop . Homicide . South Side . Was good at it too . You mind if I smoke ? - Please don 't . - Mm . Mm-mm . You ever hear of keelhauling ? - Can 't say that I have . No . - Really ? Back in the mid-1800s , if a sea captain encountered a particularly problematic sailor ... he 'd have him bound with rope , thrown over the side of the ship ... dragged underneath the hull . Poor bastard would bounce and scrape along the keel , barnacles and such . But when he 'd come up on the other side , if he wasn 't drowned or decapitated ... he tended to be a lot more cooperative . Keelhauling . Off the top of my head , I can think of about 200 sailors that 'd like to try that out on you . Captain Chandler would never allow such a thing . Hmm . Maybe . Maybe not . I never found torture that effective in my line of work . I told you I was a cop , right ? - You did , yes . - Yeah . See , I always found that if you just laid out the facts for a guy ... treated him with respect , give him a chance to redeem himself , earn something back ... he 'd make the right choice . You can 't force me back into the lab . I won 't do it . Well , suit yourself . Remember we got a hard and fast rule on this ship : Anything that doesn 't serve a purpose is gone . Ain 't no fat on the bone here . Hope you can hold your breath . I want sunlight . And someone to play chess with . Someone good . - Did you reset the electronic controls ? - Three times . They 're wiped . Did you try to rig casualty power cables from main one ? - There 's no way . The main cable riser 's melted . - Mr. Chung ... you qualified EOOW faster than anyone I 've ever seen . And you could rebuild most of this power plant with your eyes closed . You 're going to handle this . I 'm guessing the gene sequencing showed a high degree of variation . You 're having trouble distinguishing what 's causing the enhanced pathogenesis ... - and what 's just background noise . - Right you are , as usual . Let 's get to it . Shall we ? It 's going to take a week , maybe 10 days at all-stop to repair the engine damage , sir . - A week ? - We can run one of the turbines at manual ... the seawater system 's fried . We can 't cool the engines . - How long can we run without overheating ? - Maybe an hour . Another five to let them cool down . I 'll have to wash down the engines before we can try . What 's the issue ? The RO systems ? The circuit breakers in the load centers . They 're burnt out . We can 't make fresh drinking water . - How long to fix that ? - Also a week , sir . That 's the real problem . When we were in Gitmo ... we weren 't filtering water from the harbor ... because we didn 't know if it was contaminated by the virus . So we 're down to , what , 3000 gallons of fresh water ? Just about , sir . [ SIGHS ] SLATTERY : Costa Rica 'll have to wait . CHANDLER : Agreed . We 'll have to dead stick until we get that one engine online . We 've got an hour every six to make as much distance as we can ... and find the safest place to get fresh water . I 'm recommending we head here , Serrana Bank . It 's uninhabited , meaning it should be untouched by the virus . It gets over 100 inches of rain per year . We can anchor there until the engineers get us online . ETA ? Given our limitations with engine output ? Taking into account projected winds and current ... six , six and a half days . - There 's gotta be someplace else . - Area 's been well-charted , sir . Maybe we can find an abandoned ship with a fresh water supply . Send the UAV , widest possible range in all directions . If it finds any water , I wanna know . - Aye , sir . - Set course for that island . - Let 's get that engine back on line . - Yes , captain . Six days ? Even at our most severe rations , we 're going to have to travel the last two without water . - Day three ... - Day three , people start to die . Surface search radar off standby . Gain set to low . No sign of land , sir . UAV 's got nothing either . Keep looking . CREWMAN : Careful , don 't spill that . All that water in the ocean , almost impossible to make it drinkable . Hence , the stills . Oh , yeah . I am dying over here . Ah . Heard of water into wine ? This is beer into water . That is enough to make a grown man cry . Tell me about it . GRANDERSON : Sir , 10 seconds until engines up . Light off engine in five , four , three , two , one . - Starboard engine ahead full . - Aye , starboard engine ahead full . Starboard engine ahead full , aye . CHUNG : We 've got one hour until engine shutdown . Let 's make some time . Hang on , sweetheart . OFFICER 1 [ OVER RADIO ] : Sector three is negative . - No vessels , no land . OFFICER 2 : UAV to sector four . [ ALARM BLARING ] - Mr. Chung ! - I know , she 's too hot . We 're pushing this . Engine shutdown in five , four , three , two ... Chung , how are we looking ? We got any wiggle room ? The engine is piping hot ! We can 't push it any further ! E-stop One Alpha GTM . Let 's shut it down and let it cool off . E-stop One Alpha GTM . - It 's dark . Why hasn 't it gotten any cooler ? - It 's hotter inside . Hell , I 'll sleep outside standing up if I have to . [ SQUEAKING ] [ COMPUTER BEEPING ] Finished . I suppose you 'll want to triple-check the results . When you look up at the night sky ... just know that wherever I am , I 'm looking at the same stars . And I 'll be thinking about you ... and you . So no matter what , we 'll always be together . Okay ? What 's this ? Well , you said you wanted a rain check on the tea . Sorry I 'm not quick with finger sandwiches or scones . I 'd have thought you would have ... used your water on a colder drink . This can 't be tea . It 's Camellia sinensis . It 's an organic green . I actually save it for special occasions . Such as ? The breakthrough that I 've been working towards . It 's happened . I have a vaccine prototype and it 's time to test . I would have brought champagne , but ... This will do just fine . Sixty seconds until we have to power down the engine again , captain . TAO Bridge . What 's the status on the UAV ? OFFICER [ OVER PHONE ] : Sorry , sir . No sign of land or other vessels at sea ... in 360 degree search . Ten seconds , sir . OFFICER : Current destination is best option for water . We 've got a problem in the lab . CHUNG : That 's all we have ? LYNN : No more breakers . That was the last one . - Tell me the virus is secure . - Everything 's sealed . What 's happened ? The relay switch overheated . It shorted out the breakers on the last generator . - Well , is it beyond repair ? - Afraid so . Without power , the temperature inside my cooling units are rising . If they go above 41 degrees , we 'll lose the primordial sample ... the sample from the cruise ship and the experimental vaccine . - What about the portable generator ? - That seized up during maintenance . Every time we run the engines , we get power to the lab . I made sure ... Power for one hour every six is not sufficient . I need the virus at a constant low temperature . - We can throw it overboard . - Throw what overboard ? All your work into the water to cool it down . We 're in the tropics . The water must be 80 degrees . Not at the bottom . Well , even if the water is cold enough , the pressure will crush the glass containers . We could rig something for that . - Can 't we , lieutenant ? - Yes , sir . I appreciate that , but if you sink the samples , there 's no way ... to move the ship forward without raising them to the surface . She 's right . We 'll be stuck in place until we get the engines repaired . We 're already running out of water . If we can spin the propellers , we can generate electricity to cool the lab , correct ? But how can we spin propellers without the engine ? Rig the case now . Get your samples ready to put them in the ocean . SCOTT : Please be certain they 're secure . CHUNG : It 's good to go . Easy ! Gentle . Captain , we only have a small window to make it to the island on the water we have . The hours we spend doing this we will not be able to make up . Gator checked the barometer . Said there 's a low front coming in from the east . We get the winds we need , we can do this . - Relying on the winds ? - Our entire mission is in that case . I have to say this , sir . If the winds don 't blow our way , we kill our crew . SCOTT : Are you sure it 's going to hold ? CHUNG : It 's going to hold . Ten feet from the surface . Almost there . Okay . It 's in . Shouldn 't the temperature be dropping faster ? It takes a moment for the thermostat to catch up . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , come OH , come on . - We 've hit bottom . CREWMAN : All right , tie off the line ! CHUNG : Forty-two , 41 . Come on , come on . Forty . We did it . SCOTT : Thank God . Dear God . Well , you got your sunshine . Never seen a day as windless . I 'm a gambling man myself . The captain 's put all his chips in the middle of the table here . Sure hope he 's got an ace up his sleeve . Sir , the boatswain 's mates are loaded pilot chutes into launchers . A strong breeze and we 'll shoot them high and engage the larger chutes . That should give us enough speed to turn the prop and get electricity . - It won 't help us make water , but ... - So where 's the wind ? Gator said the wind was coming . It 's got to come , right ? I 'm guessing the Navy told you about my car accident . Yeah . Yeah , they did . Well , there 's something they don 't even know about . It was my fault . Tried to pass a car on a curve . Didn 't see the oncoming truck . I killed my wife and my girls . I was in the ICU for 82 days . Seven times I coded , seven times they brought me back . In between I had plenty of time to think and to wonder , " Why did God leave me here ? Why did he spare me ? There must be a purpose . Some reason . " That 's what I told myself . That 's how I woke up every day and put one foot in front of the other . It was faith ... that got me through . But these past weeks , that faith has been replaced with certainty . I am here for a reason . As are you , as is everyone aboard this ship . You are here to lead us . And we are here to follow , to execute your vision . I don 't have a vision . You do . When you stuck your hand in that engine fuse ... when you turned us away from home , when you got us out of Gitmo ... There 's a voice inside you . Maybe it 's your highest self , maybe it 's the voice of God . I don 't know . But it 's a voice of hope . You 've listened to it so far . All you have to do is keep listening . Our journey does not end here . " And Moses answered the people , 'Do not be afraid . Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today . " ' The Lord will fight for you . You need only be still . Trust that there 's something else out there . Something bigger than ourselves . Something better . Because right now we feel very , very small . We 're not too proud to say we need help , and we need it right now . So we bow our heads together . And we lift this prayer to you , and ask that you ... protect us so that we may do good in the world that you made . - Amen . ALL : Amen . Boats ! Prepare to launch the chutes ! Portside , on my mark ! Three , two , one . Fire ! Second gun . Fire ! Third gun . Fire ! - Holy shit . - Hell , yeah . Heh . Set modified condition three . - Bring up that case ! CREWMAN : Aye , sir . Okay . Gently does it . Easy . Central , this is MPA . Close load circuits on the impeller alternators . Let 's do this thing ! Bravo Zulu , Mr. Chung . This is U.S.S. Nathan James ... hailing any vessel in our vicinity . We are operating without radar . We believe we are approximately a hundred miles east-northeast of Serrana Bank . We 've been over two days without water . Hailing any vessel ... in the vicinity of Serrana Bank . We are in distress and require assistance . Sails still holding , sir . Wind from the north-northeast at 14 knots . Making four knots over water , sir . How long until engines up ? Four hours . [ COMPUTER BEEPS ] SLATTERY : Go for X.O. - X.O. , I 've got 10 more down . I think it 's time to stand down non-essential watch stations . SLATTERY : Copy that . Proceed . I 'm sorry . I thought we 'd make up more time . All right my friends , you 're going to be just fine , okay ? You 're all right . Head up . Just sip . There you go . Keep still . [ PANTING ] Keep still . [ CREWMEN MUMBLING ] Take small sips , careful . That 's good . Can I join you all ? You kidding me ? Bring it here , right beside old Tex . [ CREWMEN CONTINUE MUMBLING AND COUGHING ] We 're not gonna make it , are we ? [ OFFICERS COUGHING ] Captain ? Incoming low , slow-flying objects 20 degrees relative . Identify as seagulls . Birds mean land . Radar 's still down , sir , but that sounds pretty good to me . Water . We made it . We made it , sir . [ SEAGULLS SQUAWKING ] [ CHEERING AND CLAPPING ] I believe there are a few of you who have earned some R and R. See ? - Piece of cake . - Never doubted it , sir . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] [ CHATTERING ] [ MELLOW GUITAR MUSIC PLAYING ] - Guess we got a beach after all . - We sure did . [ BOTH CHUCKLE ] MAN : Fire it up ! I don 't see a cup of water in your hand . Take this one too . Take this one too . Okay . CHANDLER : Mr. Chung ! Figured you could use this . - Fresh from the island . - Thank you , sir . I , uh , got the auxiliary power up . At least we can keep the doctor 's work on ice while I make the repairs . You did well , lieutenant . I don 't know . Maybe I could have prevented that fire if I 'd checked the filters better . Maybe . But it was your idea and ingenuity that saved the virus . I 'm looking forward to the chief engineer getting back on her feet . Well , you 're finding your way . We all are . Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . WOMAN : Let 's see what you got . - Are you watching ? - I 'm watching it all right , I 'm watching . - The hands ... - Hands , I 'm all hands . I 'm all hands ! Hey there , Mary Poppins . You want to get in on this ? - Uh , maybe another time . - I 'm an excellent teacher . - I have no doubt ... - Show you how to move those hips . - I bet you could . - Where you going ? - Need an escort ? - Uh , maybe I 'll take a rain check . - All right . Dude , rain check ! - All right . TEX : Lock and load , ladies . It 's hula time ! Little bit of coconut milk and a little bit of something-something . - Something-something ? - Well , it 's water .

 A person 's soul continues to live on after death . Previously on Fringe ... And all we have to do is summon the soul to the host and he 'll be back here with us . Soul magnets . William is gone . You can 't bring him back . The soul magnets ... drew your consciousness into Olivia . I assure you she is totally safe . Olivia 's brain can ... accommodate my consciousness for ... several weeks . Weeks ? Not a chance . 48 hours . Then I want you out of my agent or I 'll have Dr. Bishop figure out how to drive you out . The little old lady from Iipanina . It 's The Girl From Ipanema . And no . Try again . Oh , Walter , can you try something else ? You 're taking the fun out of it . What 's the temperature , son ? We 're at 64 degrees . Perfect ! Astrid , are we ready ? Just about , Wally . - And you 're sure this is safe , Walter . - Perfectly . If everything goes according to plan , the electrical current will latch onto the dominant consciousness which is Belly 's and coax it into its new residence . I meant safe for Olivia . Oh . Of course . - No offense . - Oh . None taken . Olivia 's mind is still peacefully at rest . She won 't be aware of any of this . Though we should all take a few steps back . Excuse me ? It 's perfectly safe , son . I assure you . EEGs are online . You ready , Belly ? Aye , aye , Captain . Do it , dear . Okay . Three , two , one ... Walter ? Didn 't work . Damn ! You can reset the circuit breakers , dear . Tell the medical school we 're returning Mr. Spencer . Sorry . So what now ? Well , now I guess we try and find another brain-dead host . And what makes you think it 's gonna go any better this time ? That body fit all of your parameters , and we were lucky to find him in the first place . Perhaps we should think up another idea . I have a new idea . You said that if you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours that you would just go away . Are you suggesting that I die ? I 'm suggesting that I want Olivia back . And I 'm losing patience . Peter--oh , Peter , help me ! Astrid ! What happened ? Call 911 . Female . 31 years old . Tonic-clonic seizures . No response to 4 milligrams Lorazepam IV . BP 's 190 over 110 . Trauma bay two ! Pupils dilated . - How long has she been seizing ? - Going on 20 minutes . 25 . Okay . Start her on a phenytoin drip . - No , that 's absolutely wrong ! - Excuse me ? Gentlemen , you need to step outside unless you 're family . - She 's my girlfriend . - He 's my partner . Walter- - William cannot tolerate phenytoin--he 's anemic ! She 's crashing . Let 's defib at 360 . Too much ! It 's too much . What if his consciousness uh--uh--uh ... Changed her physiology ? A charge that size directly into her heart- - Walter , they have to do something . 354 . Charge to 360 . Doctor ... I 've been jolted once today . If you do it again ... You will kill me and the young woman I 'm living inside of . ♪ Fringe 3x19 ♪ Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Original Air Date on April 15 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = How could this have happened . Dr. Bell , you assured me that Agent Dunham was perfectly safe . And I believed that she was . With the rats , it was nearly two weeks before I began to see any complications . What rats ? My test subjects . When I was first conducting soul magnet experiments 30 years ago . The rats lasted nearly two weeks before the host 's consciousness got lost . I never anticipated that it would happen more quickly in a human . Wait . Go back . What do you mean , with the rats the host consciousness got lost ? It seems that at a certain point the brain can no longer accommodate two people 's consciousness . So one just went away . And no matter how hard I tried , I was unable to retrieve it . You gave me your word . 48 hours . You said if you didn 't find a suitable host in 48 hours- - I know what you 're going to suggest , young man . Peter 's already said as much . But as much as I may want to ... I can no longer simply leave . And why not ? Because at this point , your consciousness is the only thing keeping Olivia 's body alive . - That 's right . - Walter ... How long before Olivia 's gone for good ? Well ... I don 't know exactly , but based on what we 've seen thus far , I would say ... No more than ... a day . Well ... Well , if we 're going to get Olivia back , we 're not going to do it here . Okay ... what about this ? What if we try to activate her chi ? Acupuncture ? Yes . We try and stimulate her seventh chakra . Pure consciousness . As much as I love the notion , it could take dozens of sessions spread over several days . You said we had to find a way to pull Olivia out in 24 hours . What if we don 't ? Have to find a way to pull her out , I mean . What are you thinking ? What if , instead of trying to find a way to pull Olivia out , we try and find a way to go in ? - Peter ... - I 'm just saying consider it . We know he has a healthy ego . You don 't start a company like Massive Dynamic without an ego . But do you really think that he would let Olivia die just so- - he could go on living ? I don 't know . Maybe , maybe not . But on the list of accomplishments for William Bell , cheating death would certainly rank number one . Hmm . Kids . We think that we have found a way to bring Olivia 's mind back . And to remove William 's . Whole brain emulation . It 's another one of Belly 's old projects . It describes how an inorganic host can house organic material . We 're gonna put Belly in the computer . Much to do and not much time . While we go into Olivia 's mind , you can get to work on this . It 's very self-explanatory . Enter Olivia 's mind how ? We 've done it before- - when Olivia and Agent Scott shared the dream state . It 's a simple variation . Walter . Every brain generates a quantifiable electric field . If we can ... Tune ours precisely to Olivia 's , then we can share her mind . We can go looking for her . - Walter ? - Hmm ? Where do you keep the neurosensors ? Back shelf by the fish food . If I remember correctly , you had to put an electromagnetic probe into her brain and dose her with a massive amount of hallucinogenics . LSD ! That could solve the superego problem . Ohh ... Oh , that is brilliant , son ! This may be a weird time to ask , but have you ever tripped ? - Are you suggesting that- - - Of course ! It 's Olivia 's mind we 're entering . Presumably , it will be some maze-like iteration of her psyche . Memories are subconscious . You know her better than anyone . If she is lost in her mind , we need you to guide us . Astrid ! We need to mix up 2,000 milligrams of LSD and--and we need some sugar cubes . Please . You first , son . Don 't be nervous . I imagine there are things in this very lab that are as mind-blowing as anything that I 've experienced while tripping . Besides ... This is merely a conduit to Olivia 's mind . And when we get there , we should all be very cogent . In 30 to 45 minutes ... But I 've added an accelerant . You can start to prepare the sedative , dear . I 'll go and help Belly . Peter , don 't worry . I 'll keep my eye on the monitors . I 'll make sure you 're okay . It 's not me I 'm worried about . I 'm pretty sure there 's a good reason why we can 't enter each other 's minds . What if we kick something loose in there ? Right now , I think you 're her only hope . How 's it coming ? So far so good . What ? You 're bald . I think he 's an observer . It 's okay , Peter . Walter , we 're ready . Oh . Good . Bring him over . It 's okay . Drugs ? Yep . Lots of ' em . Whew . Ooh ... That tickles . Peter ! Peter ! Over here ! I think you better help me down . Whoa ... Whoa ! No ! No ! No ! Of all the places to grab a man , you choose the crotch of my pants ! Hey , I broke your fall , didn 't I ? You spared me no embarrassment in the process . I thought you said none of this was real anyway . I said that everything is a product of Olivia 's subconscious . My feelings are most definitely real . Where 's Belly ? I have no idea . He must have entered somewhere else . It doesn 't matter . We 're here for Olivia anyway . So what 's the next step in the plan ? There is one , right , Walter ? Please tell me that the plan doesn 't end here . Of course not ! The plan ... is to find Olivia and guide her out . We just have to start looking . Wal- - Walter ! Amazing , isn 't it ? How are we supposed to pick Olivia out ? All these people are dressed like they raided her closet . More likely , she equipped them according to her preferences . Our fault , I fear . Cortexiphan subjects experience a strong desire to blend in , to stay in the background . They were designed that way . Designed that way ? Peter . What is that ? I believe it 's morse code . And unless I 'm mistaken , that 's an S.O.S. What are you doing ? Chocolate pudding . My favorite . Ah , come on , Walter , you can 't seriously be thinking about eating right now . Of course not . I just had lunch . What are you saying ? I 'm asking who it is . It 's Olivia ! She 's found us . Tell her to stay there . We 're on our way . Any changes ? No . They all seem oddly peaceful . Do you really think it 's possible to upload a person 's consciousness to a computer ? I don 't know . I 'm just following Bell 's instructions . The aim is for the computer to mimic the behavior of neurons . I never understood why Walter was so drawn to licorice . But look at it . The swirl ... It 's Bernini 's spiral altar at St. Peter 's . It ... doesn 't end . Did you clean that up ? Yeah . I thought I 'd help you clear the table . You touched the tray with the sugar cubes ? Sure . Why ? Have you ever taken LSD ? The towers are out of proportion . We should be closer by now . It 's Olivia 's mind assigning importance . Our surroundings represent her emotional landscape , don 't forget . Oh . Oh , my . Olivia 's stepfather . What ? Where ? Over there ! That 's--that 's him ! Olivia 's stepfather . Hmm . Walter , I 'm ... Getting a bad feeling about this . Any suggestions ? Yes . Run ! Oh ! The cab ! Wait , wait , wait . You 're driving ? Okay . What the hell was that ? Go , go , go , go , go , go ! Peter ... I made a skid . There . The elevators . Walter ! Peter . Hello . Nina ! Are you a sight for sore eyes ! We 're looking for Olivia . Olivia ? We think she 's in an office near the top on the north side . Walter thinks it 's Bell 's office . Okay . This elevator is the fastest one . It will take you directly to the private lobby of the upper floors . - Walter ! - Oh ! Whoa- - okay . She tried to kill us . You saw . Why is everyone trying to kill us ? I don 't like this place . Me neither . Olivia ? You in there ? Careful , Peter . We don 't know what her mind 's put on the other side of this door . We should be ready for anything . Belly . I lied . Olivia 's not here . I was concerned if you knew it was just me , Peter wouldn 't let you come rescue me . Belly ... Why are you a cartoon ? I 'd ask yourselves the same question . I found myself on the street , but neither of you were nearby . And then a car tried to run me down . So I came here . I assumed it would be a safe haven ... But then I encountered Nina . I don 't understand . If this is all a projection of Olivia 's mind , why is everything turning against us ? When she came to us in the lab , she asked for help . What I 'm starting to think is that when my mind entered hers , her ego became confused- - her sense of self . Which , in turn , initiated the darker part of her subconscious allowing her deepest fears to run rampant . Explain that . We 're saying that Olivia is not aware that Belly 's consciousness entered hers . As far as she 's concerned , one minute she was fine , the next minute she was set adrift in her innermost thoughts . It 's her fears that are causing the siege . Then , in that case , she 's not lost , she 's hiding . That 's what she does . When Olivia is afraid , she retreats . That 's not good . And being lost is ? Yes , it 's better . I expected there to be a logical trail whereby we could track her because Olivia wanted to be found . If she 's hiding ... I 'm afraid we 're looking for a needle in a haystack . He 's right , son . Everything in her mind is dangerous and hostile to her now . How can we expect to find her if she 's frightened of everything , us included ? Because she 'd do exactly what you did- - she 'll find a place that she considers to be safe . And she 'll hide out .

And I 'll need tinfoil and instant glue and a 60-watt light bulb . And hurry , dear ! Where are we going , Peter ? Olivia told me she lived on the military base ! Olivia once told me that she sometimes thinks about what it would be like to just be normal . She said she falls asleep sometimes thinking about what it would be like if her life hadn 't taken the turn that it did . She told me that the last time she remembered feeling that way was the day before she met you and Walter at the cortexiphan trials . I think she 's down there somewhere . In that house , on that day . Hiding out . They 're all the same . How will we find her ? Her real dad painted the door red . He told her that it was good luck . The army told them it was against regulations , but he was an important man , so they let it slide . There aren 't many streets left , Peter .

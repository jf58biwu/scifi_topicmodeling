 Anyone designated as Category 1 must be taken to the new Overflow Camps . Assistance needed , please . - Code 1 . Assistance now ! - Come on . He 's my dad , okay ? He 's my father . I need you to look after him . Sorry , your father 's been reclassified . He 's Category 1 . - My father is not dead . - We have to move him . All Category 1s go to the module . So we need to get inside the camp to find out what those modules are . Welcome welcome . My name is Colin Maloney and I 'm in charge here . - Come on , come on . - Get your hands the hell off me . Colin , Jesus ! Oh shit . The patients , they 're burning them alive . Vera ! I pulled everything I could find on the Shanghai deal . And you 're due to chair the Phicorp executive board at 4 : 00 . Thanks , Janet . Stuart , is everything all right ? - You don 't seem happy . - Everything 's fine . We 're living in miraculous times . I couldn 't be happier . You shouldn 't call me Stuart in the office . Sorry , Mr. Owens . Of course suicide is impossible now , but people are becoming inventive . They 're finding ways to get as close to death as possible . That 's the philosophy of the 45 Club- - people who believe that jumping from 45 floors up or higher is the only guaranteed way to lose consciousness forever . It 's sick , but just the same , the 45 Club is catching on . Wai . Who 's calling , please ? It 's Stuart Owens . How can I help you , sir ? This must be strictly confidential . My eyes only . Is that acceptable ? Of course . In 1999 a large parcel of land near Shanghai center was purchased by a division of Phicorp . That 's where the records end . I need to know exactly what 's happened to the land since then . - Phicorp construction ? - Not on paper . There are subsidiaries , shell companies . May I ask what this is about ? Do you need to know ? It could be of some help . Of course you are aware of the changes going on in the world . Yes . My Uncle was dying . Now he 's not . I 'm trying to understand what happened , whether Phicorp had anything to do with it . I believe this construction site is key . I asked my Uncle what happened . He told me to never question a miracle . You may not like what you find . He may be right . Call me back in a few hours . Wai ? It 's me . You told me to call back . Yes . What did you find ? - A dead end . - What do you mean ? What are they building ? There 's nothing there . I looked . I found nothing , nothing at all . Goodbye , Mr. Owens . My name is Rex Matheson . I 'm with the C.I.A. I 'm on an operation inside the San Pedro Overflow . No , strike that . I 'm not with the C.I.A. or any U.S. government authority . I 'm with Torchwood . And we 're gonna expose everything that 's going on here , everything that I just witnessed . They 're calling them Category 1s . And from what I 've seen , don 't ever let them call you that . The minute you hear Category 1 you 'd better get the hell out of Dodge because they are going to burn you . That 's what this place is for- - incineration . And we all know the drill . They 'll start with the Category 1s , the ones who can 't protest . Then they 'll go on to convicted felons or illegal immigrants . Hell , anyone we just don 't like . Because everybody gets sick , which means one day everybody ends up here . Those ovens are waiting for all of us . But I will tell you one thing : I 'm gonna find the bastard that killed Vera . Oh yeah . And I 'm gonna burn his ass . End of shift . We 're done . Oh . - Guess we should go . - Damn straight . They don 't pay overtime . And make sure you get paid in cash , not checks . I 've got $ 2,000 with the Savings Expedition . They said , " You can 't remove it . " I said , " That 's my money . " They said , " It 's a national emergency . " I said , " If it 's an emergency then I 'm gonna need every cent . " Hey , I forgot my cell . You go on ahead . Don 't wait for me . What happened to her ? Not a problem , not anymore . I scrubbed my hands raw . But you see it on TV . They still find tiny little flecks of blood under the nails . What did you do to her ? Always have a fresh shirt , Ralph . Only brought it in case I had time for badminton . At the club . The club . That 'd be nice right now , a game of badminton . Colin , that module thing , what happens there ? It 's Mr. Maloney . It 's sir . I 'd like to know , sir . What happens in that module ? It 's not my fault . It 's the system . The module was storage . We were supposed to use it as storage until some Senator signs some paperwork and gives the command . I just did things a little early , that 's all . But what did you do ? You 're kidding me . They didn 't tell you ? Tell me what ? They asked me to stay on . Double shift . They said to go check in with the categorization center , help with processing . They say one thing and then they say another . - What is it ? - I just , um- - I just received these forms . And I 'm new ; I don 't know what to do , but I think they 're for you . What forms ? I don 't know . Some sort of wage form in cash . - Not sure . - Just leave ' em on the desk . Badminton . I 'm sorry ? Badminton . I was sweating profusely . Do you play ? No sir . Right . Okay . So I was sent to be your liaison . If there 's anything else I can do for you , just ask , - anything at all . - I 'm fine . - Tea ? Coffee ? - No thanks . I 'm fine . Back to work with you . Come on , hop , skip , jump . Yes sir . Oh my God . I did not agree to this . - Everything 's gonna be fine . - But we murdered her . No no . The modules were designed to kill . Therefore death within this compound is legal . - How does that work ? - Because I say so . Did you see this day staff ? They 're illegal immigrants , all of them . They can 't even spell . Look at this- - this is wrong . - We 're gonna get arrested for this . - No . No we won 't . No no no . 'Cause this is what you 're gonna do . This is wrong . This is wrong . Might make sense in Mexico , but not here . This is wrong . You 're gonna take her car and drive it into San Pedro . You know that shopping mall ? The Constitution Mall ? Drop it off there . It 's a huge car park , thousands of cars . And we 've got trucks that go past there every half hour so just authorize yourself to drive back . She goes missing , it 's got nothing to do with us . Is that gonna work ? Ralph , they 're never gonna find her . - She 's dust . - Oh Jesus . And we put this place on red alert , complete lockdown . 'Cause lockdown means that every member of the staff is logged and noted . It 'll give us a perfect alibi . She disappeared halfway across town while we were on duty all night . Security , give me the chief . We 're going to condition 1 . They 're moving men and equipment to the gates . Something 's going on . Let 's go , everybody . Lockdown . That 's right , we 're officially in lockdown , folks . Nobody leaves until further notice . Yes sir . This is a drill . We 're testing our readiness in case of emergency . P.A. This site is now in lockdown . This site is in immediate lockdown . It 's a lockdown . Yeah . Look at that . They 're closing the gates on the slaughterhouse . There 's no way they 're stopping me . I will get this evidence out . I said it 's lockdown , miss- - what is it ? Esther . Esther Drummond . Sorry , I just needed to call home . Well , read the rule book . All exterior calls have to be authorized by me . What about visitors , sir ? Shouldn 't we escort them out ? Isn 't that observer still here ? The one from Washington- - Dr. Juarez . No , she left . She 's gone . As a matter of fact , she said I was running an excellent command . Very good indeed . That 's her exact words- - very good indeed . Dr. Patel ? - Are you Dr. Alicia Patel ? - I 'm sorry , can it wait ? No , listen , you 've got to change this paperwork . There 's been a mistake . It 's about my father . Geraint Wyn Cooper , he 's been placed in Category 1 , but he 's not that bad , I swear . I 've seen him , he 's just unconscious . Well , it 's debatable . There 's a fine line between Category 1 and 2 . But you saw him . You labeled him . And there 's definitely been a mistake . I 'm just following the guidelines given by the government . Can you take another look ? If I did that for you I 'd have to do it for everyone . - We 're under enough pressure as it is . - I understand , but- - sorry , listen . You have to change this , okay ? They move the Category 1s at 6 : 00 am They 'll take him to the module . Sorry , not my department . Really ? Is that so ? Well , do you even know what your department is , Dr. Patel ? Do you even know what really happens here ? Do you know what happens in the module ? Like I said , I 'm rather busy . They burn people . They burn living people . The Category 1s , they 're still alive but they 're being burnt . This place has been built around institutional murder . I 'm not the one who makes the rules . You knew about this ? Category 1s are dead . That 's the law . Under the emergency rulings for the sake of public health , dead bodies can be incinerated en masse . Well , I 'm glad you 've got the law on your side . But are you actually there in the module ? Are you actually throwing the switch ? Well , are you ? No . No , you 're here . You 're nice and safe , hidden behind your paperwork . You haven 't got the nerve to actually watch them burn . Because then you 'd have to face the truth , wouldn 't you ? That this isn 't a hospital . This is a concentration camp . If you 'll excuse me ... They built a concentration camp here in Britain today and you- - you are one of the staff . The entire healthcare system is about to collapse . What else am I supposed to do ? You say no . You say no , that 's what you do . For the love of God , you say no . - I can 't . - Don 't you dare . Don 't you dare . Don 't you dare look at me and tell me you were obeying orders . Don 't you bloody dare . Oh , one more thing . Don 't call yourself a doctor , not anymore . Shame on you . Rhys . Oh my God , I was driving them to the module . I was driving living people into the ovens ! You weren 't to know . You were just doing your job . Yeah , well , I 'm not doing it anymore . I quit the bastard thing . Not just yet . I need you to do one more transfer for me . - My dad . We 're taking him out . - We can 't . The compound 's closed down . No more movement orders till 6 : 00 am . I know , Rhys . That 's when they 're gonna take my father to his death . All right ? I need you to steal some keys . I need you to get a hold of a lorry . I don 't- - I don 't know . I just need you to do something . Of course I will . The nurses , they change over at 5 : 00 a.m. That 's our only chance . I 'll get my dad , you get a truck , okay ? - Okay , yeah . - We can do this . We can beat the system . We can beat them all . All right ? Go . No , Janet , you don 't know me , but I know you . Yeah ? You work at Phicorp ? You didn 't answer my question . What are you drinking ? Appletini . Your name is Janet Rae Tanner . You 're 27 years old , 5 ' 9 " , 119 lbs . The youngest daughter of Gerald and Elaine Tanner of Nantucket , Massachusetts . You moved to California to attend college where you earned a bachelor 's degree in art history . You currently reside in a Westwood apartment . You go to the gym three times a week . And you drive your hybrid downtown every day to an administrative assistant position at Phicorp Industries . And you 're some creepy stalker dude last seen on " America 's Most Wanted . " I may be wanted but it 's not what you think . Listen , I don 't know what kind of game you 're playing , but I 'm meeting someone . After he has dinner with his wife . I came across some emails from you to your boss Stuart Owens . " Can 't wait to see you . " Nice . Then " Happy Valentine 's Day . " Sweet . Then a little less subtle . " You can so do me tonight . " - Ouch . - What do you want ? I want your help , Janet . Right now I 've got some friends risking their lives because we think Phicorp is doing some very bad things and we need to find out who 's behind it . Please , you can 't tell anybody about us . I won 't . I just want some information from your boss . I wouldn 't do anything to hurt him . Sweet Janet Rae , I wish he felt the same about you . I 'm sending you some more emails from Stuart Owens to the head of Phicorp Human Resources requesting your transfer to Cincinnati . Whoo-hoo ! - He 's such a romantic . - Bastard . I like the bit where he calls you limited . Limited . So what do you say , Janet ? We could sit here drinking appletinis and complaining about men all night . Or we can go get that Phicorp boss of yours . What do you say , Janet Rae ? - Love the vintage coat . - Thanks . Maybe the three of us should have a drink sometime . The three of us ? You , me and the coat . Well , I suppose I should have the salad . I 'd go for the steak if I were you , with a very large bourbon and a pack of cigarettes . Why not ? We 're gonna live forever , right ? Courtesy of Phicorp . Excuse me , I think you 're at the wrong table . You 're Stuart Owens , aren 't you ? You 're the Chief Operating Officer for Phicorp Industries . You obviously know who I am or you wouldn 't be here . The question is , who are you ? I 'm a friend of Janet 's . Your secretary ? We met at a bar , the one you were planning on going to after dinner . Does your wife know ? - Elizabeth . - Don 't go or we 'll hurt her . My associates are holding Janet hostage . You need proof ? Hello ? Who 's there ? Help . Help me . Janet , where are you ? I don 't know . I 'm in a cellar . They 've got me tied up . They 're hurting me , Stuart . Make them stop . What exactly do you want ? I 'll let you know when it 's safe to release her . Go get him . - The truth . - About what ? The miracle . How was it done ? Why was it done ? How can it be undone ? Why would I have the answer ? When the day came , Phicorp was ready . We found warehouses stocked with painkillers waiting for the miracle to come along . - That 's your smoking gun ? - You 're a man in charge . - You knew it was coming . - Mr ... . Harkness . Captain Jack Harkness . - Are you with the military ? - Freelance . I represent the people who are trying to stop Phicorp . So that security breach on the 33rd floor ... That was us . It 's not me you 're after . In fact , I 've been trying to find out the truth just as much as you . I 'm not a bad man , - Mr. Harkness . - Captain . I 'm not a bad man , Captain . I 'm not a good one , either . I 'm a middleman in every sense of the word . And faced with the thought of being who I am for God knows how long , I 'm just as keen as you to find out exactly what 's going on . Especially with the stock market threatening to collapse , a man like me needs insurance . You don 't believe me . You think I 'm the epitome of evil , the devil in a three-piece suit . In my experience that 's how it works . You 're experience must be rather simple . You have a rather archaic view of good versus evil , don 't you ? Tell me who 's behind this . I 've been trying to find out . I 've sent agents all over the world following the paper trail , the backroom deals , the holding companies within holding companies . That 's when I came face to face with the true face of evil . - The system itself . - Precisely . If the schemes and conspiracies are being plotted , then they must be seen only as patterns , waves- - shifts that are either too small or too vast to be perceived . Someone is playing the system right across planet Earth with infinite grace beyond any one person 's sight . No , I 'm sorry , Captain , but Phicorp isn 't controlling this . Profiting , yes , but this is part of a much larger design way beyond any of us . But how can you be part of it and not know what 's going on ? Let me give you an example . These warehouses full of drugs , no doubt you 'd love to uncover an incriminating memo dated the day before miracle day signed by me authorizing the stockpiling of painkillers . The truth is , a pattern like that began say maybe five years ago with the systematic increase in production in random factories around the world based on market share projections . What was the warehouse ? Washington D.C. , Third and Boston . I 'd imagine transportation of the drugs to the Third and Boston was then carried out over a 12-month period by say maybe five different haulage companies outsourced to seven or eight different independent suppliers . So that means everyone 's to blame , everyone and no one . Whoever is behind this , they don 't show themselves- - not to me , not to you . But to play the system like this- - the markets , the politics , industry- - they had to be planning this for a very long time . I wish I knew who they were . I was told that the miracle involves geography . Does that mean anything ? No . But there is one word that my operatives picked up dating back to the mid - ' 90s and then erased . - What is it ? - The Blessing . What does it mean ? There was a document from Italy from a source inside the Council of Ministers , a contact then deceased . It simply referred to The Blessing . It said " They have found The Blessing . " Yes , excuse me . Could you direct us - to Mr. Owen 's table ? - That 's his table there . It seems my wife called the authorities . Hmm . Um ... Go ahead . What the hell was that ? Check it out . Sir ? Are you all right ? What 's a Cat 1 doing out here ? Sorry . Billy , do you read me ? Uh , yeah . Yeah , it 's me . - What 's going on ? - Well , we got new orders . - New orders ? - Yeah . They need you at the modules . They need more men at the module . You 'd better get down there pronto . I 'm already here . What about the checkpoint ? I don 't know . They said to just leave it . They said- - I don 't know what they said . I wasn 't listening . That sounds like you . I 'm on my way . Identify yourself . Uh ... Just need to get out . Identify yourself . Going out for a smoke . Oh sure , man . Go ahead . Thanks . Who the hell are you ? Someone 's breached the compound , someone with a camera . No no no . Nothing 's going wrong . Nothing nothing nothing . He wants to talk to whoever 's in charge . No he doesn 't . No no no . No he doesn 't . No . Okay . Who is he ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - I don 't know . He said Torchwood . All right , you wait here . I 'll deal with it . Mr. Maloney , I need your signature on this . Not now . - I can walk with you . - I said not now ! So where 's he going ? Where do you think you 're going ? - Mr. Maloney . - How blonde are you ? It 's a lockdown . We haven 't got clearance . Gotta stay at your desk . I 'm telling you right now , you 're making a big mistake . You 're gonna all be implicated- - all of you . All right , leave us alone . Go to Jackson on the west gate . He 's got new allocations for you . Who the hell are you ? I 'll ask the questions . I need to know who you are . I told them already- - Rex Matheson . Now who the hell are you ? Colin Maloney , thank you , Director of the San Pedro facility . Director , hmm . There 's gonna be hell to pay . 'Cause you 're the man in charge . What do you mean ? Look , just call the police , okay ? Go ahead , call them . Arrest me . Because I want to make a statement . I 'm gonna expose everything that 's going on here- - what you guys are doing to the patients and what you did to Vera . - What they did to who ? - You built ovens . And you 're the director so you know that . I 'm not in charge of policy . We had instructions that got sent out nationwide , worldwide , and we had orders from above not to say anything . - I just did as I was told . - Okay . All right . Okay , you 're the middleman . I get it . But I 'm telling you right now you need to listen . Because you 're caught in the middle of this thing just like me . There are things happening here that 's way out of control . Someone 's using this place to bring back murder . There was a Dr. Juarez on this site , right ? Yeah ? Well , someone burned her alive . No no no no no . Couldn 't happen . And you 've got the chance now . Look at me . Look at me . You 've got the chance to make yourself a hero . Because we could tell the world . Yeah , I 'd be a hero ? Colin , my man , when this thing blows wide open , people will stand trial for crimes against humanity . But you see , you- - you could be standing right by me , right by my side . I suppose , uh , it 's my duty to help . If we could find the one to blame- - must be one of the staff , one of the guards . I 've got evidence . It 's right there . Go ahead , take a look . They took it off me . I taped it . I taped everything . You can see it all . It 's proof that someone 's using the modules for murder , not just the Category 1s either . I don 't know . - I shouldn 't . - Do you want proof , hmm ? Then look at it . Take a look at it . Play the tape , damn it , and you 'll see why you need to let me go . I don 't know . I shouldn 't . Yeah , play it . I 'm sorry . Mr. Maloney just called about that Torchwood man . Sorry , I 'm new to all this . Is his name Rex Matheson ? Yeah . Okay . I 'll call him back . Oh , what extension was he on ? I don 't know . Generator room . That was it . Yeah , thanks . I told you you can 't go out in a lockdown . I said you 're not allowed outside . I 'm reporting you ! I 'm sorry . I knew you had to see that . - You okay ? - Oh yeah . So now do you see ? You see why you need to release me , right ? Come on , we should go to the police together right now . I don 't know what to- - I haven 't got anything I can- - you hurt yourself ? Oh yeah . It 's a long story . Come on , how about we get out of here , huh ? I wonder- - what can I use ? They gave you the keys . - Yeah , but what can I use ? - You have the keys . Just can 't focus , can 't think . I 've never been too practical . I 'm more of an ideas man . I 'm very good at badminton . Yeah , all right . Say , how about you unlock me now ? It 'll have to do . What are you doing ? Hey , Colin , look at me . Colin , what are you doing ? Look at me in my eyes . Colin , what are you doing ? Don 't do that . Look at me . Colin , look at me in my eyes . Look at me . Colin . Colin ! Don 't do it . - It was you . - I 'm sorry . - You killed her . - I 'm very sorry . It 's just been such a long day . All I want to do is go home . But you can 't kill me . Don 't do it . I can 't die . You can 't kill me . Colin , don 't you see ? I won 't die . Mr. Maloney ? Mr. Maloney ? I 'm here . What is it ? Uh , there 's a phone call for you , sir . Very important . I could take over for you here . A phone call ? Who is it ? Um ... Dr. Juarez . She said it 's urgent . She said that , um , she needs the population of the camp . Dr. Juarez ? When did she call ? Just now . Did you speak to her ? Yes , yes I did . And this was when ? When exactly was just now ? Five minutes ago . Esther ! Esther ! - Rex ? - Esther , just run ! He killed Vera ! Esther ! Leave her alone , damn it ! Ow ! Esther ! What happened ? - I killed- - I killed him . - No . - Oh my God , I killed him , Rex . - No no . You didn 't , okay ? Nobody dies , remember ? He 's just a Category 1 now . Look , stay with me . Come on , look at me . Look at me . I need you to go in his pocket and get the keys . No Esther , we 've got to get out of here . Come on , stay focused . Get the keys . Go get the key . This has got to stop . Thank you . Thank you . Yes . Bloody hell . What do you think you 're doing ? My job , isn 't it ? Don 't scare a man like that . Patient transfer at this time of night ? - I just do what I 'm told . - And what exactly were you told ? Patient transfer , 5 : 00 a.m. - Who told you this ? - My supervisor , who else ? What 's his name ? Uh , well , he 's got more authority than you , mate . He 's a Captain . Captain Jack Harkness . He ordered me . That 's a bit odd . I don 't see a Harkness on our roster . I 'd better make some calls . God . Typical . Not long now , Dad . I promise . Hell to pay , Rhys Williams , if you don 't show . Hell to pay . - Can I go now ? - I don 't understand . They 've stopped movement orders until 6 : 00 a.m. But you 've been given special instructions apparently . Why 's that then ? Yeah , well , this Captain Harkness must have taken a shine to me . He had that look about him , if you know what I mean . Not that there 's anything wrong with that of course . Oh , look at the time . I 'm late enough as it is . I need to make another call . Did you hear ? Boatload of Category 2s arrived in Cardiff last night . One of those cruise ships full of British citizens from abroad . - All sick as dogs ? - Hell of a state . Expelled form Europe like boat people . Last thing we need is more patients . Come on , we 've got to get these Cat 1s ready for transport . All right , Dad , I 'm getting you out of here now . Okay . Bless you . Where the hell were you ? I was on time , only this officious bastard held me up . Why didn 't you just run him over or something ? I 'm not the run-over type . You know that . Anyway , I drove off when the silly bugger was on the phone . He probably followed me . One , two , three . Okay , let 's get him . - Gently now . - Okay , I got you . Ready , one , two , three . All right . All right . Get going then . Take dad home . There 's something I 've got to do here first before I go to the states . You 're going back to America ? We 've got to find out what 's behind all of this and put a stop to it once and for all . But before I do , I haven 't finished with this place yet . That 's him ! That 's him ! That 's him ! Hey hey hey . Where 's my goodbye kiss , you big fool ? Get going . Now you hold it right there ! Give me the south gate . Hold it right there . Here we go . Hey you ! Hey ! Fire ! I just hope someone 's listening . Hello . Anybody home ? You 're a sight for sore eyes . - Jack , is that you ? - In the flesh . - You okay ? - Yes ... I know , Jack . I 'll be there soon . - I 'm coming back to the fight . - To the fight . We need you . But first , there 's something I 've got to show you . Record it for me , Jack . Oh . Lovely . Jack , you watching ? I 'm here . Make your message . This is the truth for the whole world to see . We let our governments build concentration camps . They built ovens for people in our names . Now I don 't care if the whole of society bends over and takes this like a dog , I 'm saying no . That 's my girl . Well , all the guards are gone . The regular army is coming in . They 'll shut it down . But it was sanctioned by the government . And they 've got my name . They 've got my name . I was on staff as Esther Drummond . Esther , listen , stop it , okay ? Just stop it . You saved me . I spent all that time wanting a job like yours . - Look at me now . - Okay . It 's okay , you- - you 're allowed to feel like this . Come here . Come here . But listen to me . This is not over , not for Torchwood . And I need you in this fight . Okay . So get it together and do it fast . Okay . I 'm fine . I 'm- - I 'm ready . Yeah . Me too . Flesh can burn . That 's the Stark truth facing the world today . We 've known since Miracle Day that flesh can still burn . But today there 's outrage ... We did it . We 're whistle-blowers . Every major news organization . The world knows the truth now . Let the outrage begin . You really think it 's that easy , huh ? The death of Vera Juarez demands a full investigation , but there will be no apology for the Category 1 process . Now we exist in a permanent state of emergency . The White House stands by our disaster response as appropriate and as sanctioned by Congress . This is exactly what we would do in times of a famine or a plague or pestilence . You see that ? They should be shutting down those camps right now . They 're just talking about it . At least we made it public . Torchwood wasn 't designed to fight politicians . If we really want to stop this happening , we need to look at the bigger picture , find out what The Blessing is . Hello , I 'm not available , but please leave your name and number and I 'll call you back as soon as I can . Thank you . Rhys , it 's me again . I 've landed . I 'm back in L.A. Where are you , you bloody fool ? Why aren 't you picking up the phone ? Call me back . Gwen Cooper to the white courtesy phone . Gwen Cooper , you have a call . Gwen Cooper to the white courtesy phone . Gwen Cooper , you have a call . This is Gwen Cooper . Hello , this is Gwen Cooper . You said I had a message . Lenses . What ? What did you just say ? Lenses . No . Who- - who- - who are you ? What do you want ?

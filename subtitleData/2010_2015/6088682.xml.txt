 Help me please , someone ! - Hello , ducky . - Hello , jack . Big , bad jack the ripper 's not used to a woman Who puts up a fight , is he ? Running away is no way to treat a lady . - Never let it be said Old jack doesn 't know how to treat a lady . - Well done , agent wells . Snagging the ripper 's lantern in your first month . The older agents will become jealous . - They already are . Mr. Kipling 's taken to writing rude verses on the walls . I must say , my dear , you 've taken to life in the warehouse With great aplomb . - Indeed . I 've finally found a place where my other talents Can be used for the good of the empire . - Oh , not just the empire . The entire world . Great britain is simply the warehouse 's current home . England did not house warehouses 1 through 11 ? Nor will it house warehouse 13 . That honor belongs to another nation , When England 's power wanes . Well , then there will never be a warehouse 13 . For the sun will never set on the british empire . Quite , quite . Tea ? - Wowza . That was better than 3-d imax . Yeah , I mean , that was amazing , But why are we watching highlight reels of h.G. When she 's playing happily ever after With what 's-his-name in wisconsin ? - Actually , they broke up . She 's now dating a woman named giselle . Ooh , now that 's a highlight reel I would like to see . No , these aren 't highlights , agent lattimer . This artifact is the round table That inspired the legend of king arthur 's court . Now it is the warehouse 's time capsule . It stores the memory of an agent 's defining moment With the warehouse . Today , you will all contribute . - Today ? No , it 's too soon . Too soon ? Too soon for what ? - Agents only contribute To the time capsule when ... when ... - Yes , arthur . Warehouse 13 is reaching the end of its tenure . ¶ It has nothing to do with anything Any of you have done . Well , wherever we all go , I mean , It 's gotta be better than south dakota , right ? The host country supplies the new agents . It 's in the manual . - How much time do we have ? Whether it 's next week or next year is irrelevant . - Well , says you . Your job today is to contribute To the time capsule . - Okay , I 've got an idea . How about instead of sitting around The mystical table of kumbaya , We do something crazy like , I don 't know , Stop it from moving ? Right ? What ? I mean , come on , you guys are all thinking it . The warehouse is going to move . It 's a natural order of things , Not a crisis to solve . What , and you can 't stop it ? I mean , you are the caretaker , right ? So take care of it ! Calm yourself , agent lattimer . - Calm ? We 're talking about losing our home And you are just sitting there like some kind of ... - Hey , here 's an idea . Before somebody says something They will definitely regret , How about I go first so somebody can cool off ? Good idea , miss donovan . So do I just think a happy thought or ... Place your hand inside the circle . The artifact will choose your defining moment . Claudia donovan . Warehouse 13 : Next generation . That was awesome ! Shut up ! Joshua ! ¶ Mykes , how long can this thing make us tap dance ? - Probably until we 're dead . Why did you activate it ? - Well , I 'm sorry . I see a button and I have to push it . It 's who I am . they found us ! All : ¶ hear the beat of dancing feet ¶ I used to dream about being chased by leggy showgirls . Oh , just shut up and dance ! All : ¶ 42nd street ¶ little nifties from the fifties ¶ ¶ innocent and sweet ¶ sexy ladies from the eighties ¶ Oh , what did I do in a past life to deserve this ? Oh , come on ! All : ¶ where the underworld can meet the elite ¶ - Okay , that 's it . No more mr . Nice gay . All : ¶ where the underworld can meet the elite ¶ ¶ 42nd street ! - I hate musicals . - Anything ? - Yeah , well , We know that the artifact Is the marquee from the strand theater ... Whoa , whoa ... Where 42nd street premiered . Whoa , whoa , whoa . - Easy , tommy tune . - Hey , guys ! So we led our girls to the escher vault And locked ' em in . Also , I think we 're gonna need a new escher vault . - They 're everywhere . There 's an army of ' em in front of the marquee too . You can 't get near it . - Well , can we destroy it ? - Yes ! Busby berkeley 's flask might be able To direct the original tin pan from tin pan alley To destroy the marquee 's bulbs . Yeah , somebody 's gonna have to recharge that marquee . - Recharge it with what ? - Well , ironically ... whoa ! Somebody 's gonna have to do a big , showstopping number . Well , this thing 's tapping us to death . Who has the energy for that ? Oh , no , no , no . I 'm just b-team . - Claudia , listen to me . You 're our only hope . You may be going out there b-team , But you 're coming back a-team ! You can do it , kiddo ! Only not in that outfit . - Your smiles don 't scare me . Okay , that 's a scary smile . Cheating ! - Whoa ! I think I 'm just pissing them off . - I found the flask ! Let 's go . I 'll find it . You distract them . - Hi , girls . This should be a turn on , but it 's really , really not . ow ! Artie ! - I 've got it ! Let 's go ! - Excuse me , excuse me . ¶ - Here we come , claud . - Pour the flask . - Come on . Busby berkeley was as drunk driver . It 's gonna make this tin pan swerve And hit all the lights . - Okay . Claud , bring it home . ¶ - Throw it ! - Oh , god . My feet . - And ... Scene . Talk about one singular sensation . Oh , man am I gonna be sore tomorrow , but come on ! Best job ever ! All : Best job ever ! Claud , if that 's your defining moment , Then why the sad face ? Yeah , you look like someone died . - Nothing . Uh , sore feet equals sad face . No biggie . I would imagine that that was the moment You realized you didn 't want to be caretaker after all . - You w ... you ... you what ? - Thanks , mrs . F. - I call them as I see them . We thought you wanted to be caretaker . But only because you said it a lot . - Yeah , guys , listen ... That day , I realized how much I love being an agent . I mean , I can 't imagine ever giving that up . Not even to be caretaker . I 'm sorry . - No . You don 't have anything to be sorry about . You 're right , this is the best job in the world . The question is , why is no one else Freaking out about losing it ? We are , it 's just some of us Are a little quieter about it than others . - Oh , well , I 'm sorry . Then someone needs to be loud about it . Look , we 're not losing the warehouse . I 'm gonna make sure of it . Look , artie , I know how important my destiny is to you . You don 't have to explain anything to me . We all support you , right , artie ? I 'm must a little incredibly surprised is all . Well , it 's only human to have doubts . Right , mrs . Frederic ? You must have had your doubts . - No , I was always resolute . - Thank you again . It doesn 't matter anyway . I know my responsibility . - No one is forcing you . Is anyone forcing this on her ? - I 'm doing it . I 'm not gonna let everyone else down and b ... The hell with everybody else . You have to do what 's right for you Or you 're gonna miserable for the en ... Can I choose the memory That I want to contribute to the time capsule ? You want to show them that , arthur ? It could backfire on you . You know , I 'm absolutely certain that it will . So that 's how it works . - Wrong again , arthur . Hey , when do I get one of these ? When I say so . Hold this . Did this used to be a fudge factory ? In the 1940s , this spot was an officers ' club . Help me lift this thing up . Okay , yeah . It is gonna be 11 : 35 In five , four , three , two , one . Wow . We 're in the past . - More like the past is here . Oh , well , it makes perfect sense when you put it that way . Nothing in this job makes sense . Now pay attention . This is December 31 , 1941 . The americans , three weeks ago , were attacked by japan . So these guys are about to ship off to war ? Yes , and somebody here does not want this party to end . There is one man in here that is using an artifact To create a time bubble that is holding this moment in place Since that night . Time bubbles and draft dodgers . No wonder you love this job . no , god . I have been trying to snag This artifact since the ' 80s . The only problem is I can only enter here once a year . Because the artifact was put into play December 31 , 1941 at 11 : 35 p.M. ? - Very good . Yes , but the versailles forks That keep us from being trapped here ... don 't ask . They also pop us right out of the bubble at midnight When the artifact resets time to 11 : 35 . So you can only investigate this case For 25 minutes at a time once a year ? - Annoying , isn 't it ? That 's why I brought you . Fresh eyes . Now we 've only got 22 minutes . All right , so , now I 've narrowed it down to three guys Who might do anything to stay here . The first guy 's over there . He 's captain jason fleece And he 's gonna leave behind his wife and three kids . Over there , that is lieutenant william drischler . He 's single , but he 's got a very sick mom . And over there sitting with that woman , That is lieutenant jonah roth . He eloped with her , laura , the day before pearl harbor . Let 's start with the angry guy first . - Why ? Well , these other two are partying Like this is their last chance , And as far as they know , it is . - Look at you . All right , good . Okay . Gimme the bag . - Uh , excuse me , ma 'am . I 'm special agent scott mohr . I couldn 't help notice that that officer made you cry . Is everything okay ? - Oh , yes . He 's my husband . I 'm just afraid he won 't come back to us . - To " us ? " - Oh , my . I haven 't even told jonah . Please don 't say anything . - You 're in the family way . Oh , ma 'am , you really should tell him . - No . Please . He lost his brother at pearl . He 's dead-set on going . If I told him and he stayed , Why , it would tear him apart . I ... Realize how difficult this is for you . You really , really don 't want him to go . Gosh , look at me blubbering in front of a complete stranger . I should get back to jonah . - Well , roth was clean . - That was weird . Generally means artifact . What ? Well , she refilled her glass three times , But I never saw her take a single sip . - Oh . Thomas wedgewood 's champagne glass ! How did I miss that ? yeah , it was so obvious . - Okay , we gotta go . I 'm sorry , but I gotta go . You know I gotta . - I know , jonah . I 'm sorry I got upset . I know you have to go . You also know he 's not leaving , don 't you mrs . Roth ? Champagne glass , please . - What is going on ? - Less than a minute . I found a way to keep you safe . Stopping time isn 't gonna keep him safe . It 's gonna keep you both trapped . You have to believe things are gonna turn out for the best . - What if they don 't ? Life comes with bad times and good ones . If you stay here , you 're gonna miss ' em all . Everyone here has a future , even your baby . - Baby ? Are you ... are we ... agent mohr . I 'm sorry , but it 's his too . - Jonah , yes . - 12 seconds . Honey , I don 't know what 's going on right now , But I want to meet our baby . All : Eight , seven , Six , five , four , three ... - Wow . That was ... wow . - Happy new year . You did an excellent job . I am proud of you , kid . What 's the matter ? You all right ? Yeah , it just kind of hit home a little . You know , a mother afraid her baby Will grow up without a father . - Oh , scott . I didn 't even think ... I 'm so sorry . I shouldn 't have ... - no , no , no , it 's okay . You didn 't even know about me , dad . When you found out , you came back . - What the what ? Dad ? - Dad ? You wanna tell me about this ? Look , when I was arrested for treason , I was seeing somebody pretty seriously And ... She was pregnant . You abandoned your pregnant girlfriend . - No , no , no . She never told me that she was pregnant . And as far as she knew , Arthur weisfelt went to jail and then disappeared , And I didn 't find out about scott till years later . - He 's telling the truth . - Thank you ! Now in those days , the regents were the only ones Who were granted the privilege of having a " one . " And that arrangement ... Was not gonna work for me . Arthur demanded that agents be allowed to have a " one " With whom to share the secrets of the warehouse Or he would tender his resignation . I had to fight for my happiness , Just as you have to . If you don 't want to be caretaker ... - This is all very interesting And educational , but , uh ... Claudia , you 're missing the p ... I 'm gonna have to process this . I believe that the phrase that you 're searching for Is " I told you so . " - Come on , mykes , help me . Nobody knows this place like you . - Okay , here it is . Great , which one 's the manual ? - All of ' em . - Oh . - Yeah , it 's a lot of info . - All right , well , good . Then there 's gotta be a loophole to keep the warehouse here . Pete , I 've never read anything About keeping the warehouse in place When it 's time for it to move . Well , you couldn 't have read it all . Not every page of every book , but come on , pete . All right , mykes , don 't just stand there . Come on , partner . Grab one and we 'll get this job done in no time . Pete , look , our only job today ... listen to me . Our only job today is the time capsule , okay ? Wow , uh ... you really don 't care , do you ? - What ? - No . You 're about to lose all of this , myka . You 're gonna lose us . You 're gonna lose all of us , But you ... you don 't care . - That 's not fair . No , I 'm sorry I took you away From your warehouse 13 exit interview . Just go ahead . Go play with your time capsule . I 'll save the day . Fine , but when you can 't save the day , When you can 't stop this , don 't call me ! - Fine . - Fine ! - Fine ! - Fine ! I don 't wanna read all this . Because he 's a crazy old man . Yes he is . Shh , he 's here . look , artie , I get it . You know , I think of you as a father-like person , But you 're my boss , so , you know , Whatever you choose to share or not share Is really your prerogative . But you have a son that you take on snag and bags ! - We haven 't done it in years . And he has his own full life now . - When do you see each other ? - He lives in san diego . We go to comic con together . It 's all very normal . - Really ? - Yeah . Because none of this seems normal to me . You know , I have the best of both worlds , Uh , being a father and an agent . - But why couldn 't you tell me ? Because you would have wanted to meet him . - Hells yeah I would . And then you would have wanted him to be an agent . - Why not ? It looked like he knew his way around an artifact . No , the whole point of the " one " Is to have them outside the warehouse To keep us balanced . - Yeah , but ... - no , no , you see , There 's no but . There 's no but . Please , claudia , listen to me . I 'm just trying to give you a life lesson here . What , that ignorance is bliss ? No , that in order to stay sane You sometimes have to be a little selfish . So this was your way of saying you 're not upset That I secretly don 't want to be caretaker ? - No , I 'm upset ! You shouldn 't keep secrets from me ! But ... but ... ugh ! Double standards ! Yes , do as I say , not as I do . The prerogative of a father-like person . Look , if you had just talked to me I might have been able to help you understand That you , miss donovan , do not have to commit To the rest of your life today . It 's not a crime to change your mind . You just have to stay true to yourself . Even if it means being a little selfish . My god , she 's been listening ! I just want you to be happy . - Thank you . So really ? Best of both worlds ? - Yeah , I have a great son . He 's helped me be a better father ... To you . And I have the warehouse . Life is perfect . - The warehouse is moving . Right , well , nothing 's perfect . Really , you were there for that ? He 's too selfish to know that other people are hurting too . Our little secret . I 'm sorry , am I interrupting ? - Not at all , no . - Okay , well , um ... Away we go . - Welcome to warehouse 13 . Whoo ! Whoa ! I have cancer . Well , it 's all very simple when you look at the facts . Mimi 's husband had gone bankrupt , So rachel was floating her cash In exchange for mimi 's silence About her affair with her spanish tutor . But rachel 's husband already knew And had told his mistress , carly , all about it . But carly doesn 't keep any secrets From her other lover , nicole . And nicole was using one of those secrets To blackmail maddie . About what , you may ask . Well , it turns out that maddie has an addiction . She 's emptied their bank account Buying antique japanese ceramic art on ebay , And one such piece is the five-tailed fox , Known in japanese folklore As the elusive thief and prankster . Now , I wonder if any of you know That when maddie touches the fox , She transforms into a ninja cat burglar . And I wonder if you know that it 's not just me . - That I did not know . - Hey , maddie . Do you have any more of this dip ? I mean , it is to die for . Ninjas ! Myka ! - Pete ! Myka ! - Ow . I think that nicole used to be a man . - Thanks for the save . I always got your back , honey pie . - Hello . I know , right ? I got to use all of my deductive skills And kick some suburban ass . I was actually thinking how obvious it is That you have a thing for pete . - What ? - A love thing . Yeah , that 's hilarious . - Look at your face . - No . No . No , okay ! Pete and I ... there is no pete and I. There 's ... I mean , there 's ... Oh , my god , I 'm in love with pete . Oh , I hate myself so much right now . You know , what difference does it make ? It 's over . And this is how it ends ? Just over ? And what am I supposed to do ? I 'm supposed to ... supposed to walk away ? Just walk away . You know , you give your whole life to something Every day without complaining ... Well , no serious complaints ! I 'm here every day . Every day I 'm right here For you and your damn ping ... your pings . Ping , ping , ping ! Ping , ping , ping , ping , ping ! I 'm like a slave at your beck and call . You know I have lost ... I have lost friends , family . People I 've loved ... Have died in my arms , But I stayed faithful . I gave you everything And now that there 's nothing left ... For you to take , you 're just gonna ... just leave . Whore ! That 's what you are , you know ! Yeah , you 're just selling out to the highest bidder . Fine ! You wanna go ? Go ! That 's what you wanna do ? Go ! You don 't want me . I sure as hell don 't want you ! En ... enjoy your new home . You think you 're gonna find somebody like me ? Somebody who cares about you like I do ? Ha ! Ha ! Good luck with that . Good luck finding somebody as devoted ! Somebody who would give their whole life ... Without a " thank you . " Without even a ... Piddling , little miniscule ... Acknowledgment that they 're appreciated . That they even matter to you ... At all . Okay then . You 're welcome . Seriously , that was mr . Frederic ? - Hey . - Hey . - What was that ? Nothing ... uh ... I mean , it 's ... Agent jinks , it 's your go , I believe . - Oh , yeah . Can I maybe go later , or you know , not at all ? Oh , come on . Don 't go all pete on me . We each have to do this . - No , I 'm not , it 's just ... What if I don 't have a defining warehouse moment ? Of course you do , pookie . We all do . - Let 's be honest . I have never completely belonged here . I 'm kind of our marilyn . - Munster ? Uh , no way . I 'm marilyn . No , no , no . You are eddie . Pete is herman , myka 's lily , artie 's grandpa , And mrs . Frederic is ... Not really part of the pattern . Steven , why don 't we let the warehouse Decide if you belong ? There are things that you don 't know about the regents . Why does everyone wanna talk today ? I 've come to aid you , brother . - Claudia . Claudia , are you there ? - Yes , helena , thank god . For some reason , we get no reception at all In the spleen . - You have got to come out . My shrinking device was only designed For three-hour intervals . If it reverses , you 'll explode right through artie 's chest . But we found the artifact and I think we can get to it Before it strikes 12 : 00 . The clock is lodged in artie 's heart . - No . It 's too dangerous to pilot the nautilus iii Into artie 's heart . - We know . Steve has a plan . It 's actually claudia 's plan . I apparently volunteered for it . - It 's our only shot . I 'll reel you back as soon as you snag it . I think I just saw a hamburger go by . - Just go . whoa . Okay , I 'm in artie 's heart . - Any sign of it ? - No . I can hear it , but I can 't see it . - Time 's up , you guys . - Wait , wait , wait , wait . There it is up there . - Steve ? Steve , are you still in the heart ? - Yeah . I am . I really am . - Don 't belong here , huh ? Who else could have made that shot ? Do you feel better now , princess ? - Yeah . But not because of the shot . I was inside a beating human heart . I 'd forgotten about that moment . It ... Was indescribable . I ... you know , I saw it . I was there . It was like ... - nirvana ? You know , when I came to the warehouse , I didn 't think that I 'd ever find peace . Just ... So much chaos , you know ? But ... - you found it . - No . No , it was given to me . The warehouse showed it to me . That 's what today 's about , isn 't it ? I mean , th ... this time capsule , it 's not just for the warehouse . - No . This ritual is also the warehouse 's gift to you . Oh , good . Pete , listen , I really need to ... What are you doing ? Look I 'm sorry , myka , but I am not gonna let my future Be decided by some glowing hunk of metal . Huh ? You hear that ? Let me see you move the warehouse After I throw you in the furnace . - Uh , pete , listen , I have ... No , I know , I know , I know . I 'm overreacting . Yes , you are . But that 's not why I 'm here . Oh , and I 'm really sorry about what I said earlier . You 're the last person on earth That I 'd ever wanna hurt . You mean way too much to me . Well , that 's actually why I w ... But I would go crazy without the warehouse , myka . You know , I 've been bouncing around without a purpose For my entire life . - Yeah , w ... I didn 't last long as a husband or a marine Or a secret service agent . - Have another ... I mean , come on , I 've basically been a screw-up My entire life . But here ... here in the warehouse , I 'm the best version of myself . - Okay , just stop ... - but if I 'm not pete lattimer , Heroic warehouse agent And the partner that drives myka bering crazy , Then who the hell am I ? - Would you just shut up ? Ah . That 's very funny . Good one . But you can take off the thimble , steve . I 'm flattered , but I told you that 's not how I sw ... Sw ... swing . - What are you doing ? - No fever . Did you accidentally touch a nympho artifact ? Okay . Okay , pete , look . I know you 're worried About who you 're gonna be without the warehouse , And this is the thing . It 's ... it 's not where you are that defines you . It 's who you are . It 's the decisions that you make . I know , but I don 't wanna lose the warehouse , And I don 't wanna lose ... - Pete . Pete , you can 't lose me . It 's not possible . You can 't . Because , um ... I love you . - So you ... you kissed me ? For realsies ? - Yeah . So , um ... What are you gonna do about it , lattimer ? - I love you too . Wow . Listen , before we ... Uh , move in any sort of direction , I need you to do something . - Oh , no , no , no , no . Do not say the time capsule . - The time capsule ! Come on . - You said it . You said it . - Yes , I did . And you know what ? You better get used to doing what I tell you . - Oh . - Yeah . Could be good , but it could be bad . So when do we get naked ? - Well , we body swapped . You 've been me naked . Oh , yeah , that was a good day . Ooh ! - Oh , uh , after five years , I probably should tell you the whole punching thing ... Really turns me on . - I know . naughty . - I 'm told you read auras . - Yes . Yours is an old soul . - Don 't remind me . Just people ? - No . Objects , places . You 'll fit in quite nicely here . - Yes . Some day , I 'm gonna die here . I can see it . - I promise you , leena , I will do all that I can to prevent that . - You won 't be able to , But it 's all right . - Okay . Let 's do this thing . - Excuse me . - Steve . Are you okay , man ? Yeah , no , I just ... just need a minute . Are we over our little tantrum , agent lattimer ? - Oh , yeah . What 's that ? An invitation to endless wonder . - " mica . " - myka . - Myka ? - Myka . I 'm thrilled you 're on the team . - You 're a lucky man . You 're in tune . - What is that ? Don 't leave ! Rockin ' my world , lady . - You 're lying . - Oh , yeah . This is gonna be fun . Myka , where are you ? Hey , hey , hey . - We should be safe now . Wouldn 't you rather a nice little fish ? - Okay , stop . I was young . It was stupid . You 're pretty when you smile . People that make you feel safe . Wait ! Pancakes ! I 'm not gonna remember dying ? Well , it was just sitting there . - Read the screen . You and artie have gotta get out of here . What 's that ? Ta-da ! All : Surprise ! - Thank you . You did everything right . Stop ! Cha-cha-cha . Pete , please don 't . You are a stunningly beautiful woman . yeah ! The time machine set us on fire ! We got a little story to tell you . Va-va-voom . - Stop touching things ! - And I just really love you . Mrs. F. , why was pete 's memory Of all that and not just one case . - Tell them , agent lattimer . You know . - Maybe my defining moment Is all of it ... Every minute ... That I got to spend with you guys . And I 'm sorry mrs . F. I just was scared . I was scared that if I lost this , I 'd go back to being the person I was before , and ... But this is who I am now . The warehouse and ... and all of you Have made me a better man . If it ends tomorrow or if it goes on forever , Nothing ... nothing will ever change that . Or maybe you broke the table . Oh ! I 've never heard you laugh before . I am a woman of infinite surprises . Can we , uh ... can we watch some more ? - Yes , please . uh , hang on , hang on . Yeah , I got a ping . There 's a ping . - Right . - Back to work . - Let 's go . - So is it really over ? I believe I 've mentioned this more than once . This particular wonder is endless . - Really ? Just this once , I can 't get a straight answer out of you ? - See you tomorrow , peter . - See ya tomorrow , irene . Someone in poughkeepsie is breathing fire ? It had to be fire , didn 't it ? - This sounds familiar . - Can you rewind that ? It looks like there 's something wrong with his skin . Wait a minute , has he got scales ? We have scales . Not at work , okay ? Never at work . Okay , this is just gonna be gross . She is not lying . Hey , we can go . I 've got an aunt in wappingers falls . - Oh , no , no , no , no , no . I 've gotta stay here Claudia , I 'm telling you ... no , I am ordering you ... Oh , come on , artie . They 're practically related . So does that mean we 're going ... I 'm not the first grumpy old fart To run this place , and I won 't be the last , But I 'm the grumpy old fart running it today , So you 'll do as you 're told . I 'm not saying I won 't , jack . I 'm just saying this place seems To take over a guy 's life . - How could you even consider Turning down endless wonder ? Can we focus for five seconds on this ? Relax , I 'm just asking if I can commit The rest of my life to this . - Perhaps ... - Miss donovan . You should spend less time worrying about the future And more about the present . - I didn 't hear you come in . - You never will . Miss donovan . - Jack . Agent maddox . Someone once told me it 's not a crime to change your mind . Sometimes you have to be a little selfish . I thought you said the warehouse Might be moving anyway . Jack , if I had a nickel for every time The warehouse almost moved . Sometimes it just takes a liking to ... - You all right , miss d . ? - Yes . You three just reminded me of ... Carry on . - All right , back to work . All right . When you say change your mind ... I hate it when she does that . All right , if it was obama 's basketball ... - Egyptian endless wonder . Endless wonder . It 's everywhere . - A world of endless wonder . - Endless wonder . Endless ... Wonder . Row after row of endless wonder . - Endless wonder . - Endless wonder ? endless wonder . - Endless wonder . Endless ... Wonder .

 There is an infinite number of Universes , and in each of them , there is a version of us . Previously , on Fringe ... Just because you walked in my shoes , don 't you think for a moment that you know me . You are just incapable of trust . Coming from the person who kidnapped me and stole my life . I have torn holes in both the Universes so that we can begin to work together to fix - You were right . They don 't remember Peter . He served his purpose . The timeline has been rewritten , and yet , traces of him continue to bleed through . He was here , and then he was gone . I saw him ! Tell me about the day the picture was taken . I think I was six years old . We 'd go camping ... In the White Mountains in the summer . Who took the picture ? My mom . I remember she was laughing . Do you have a good relationship with her ? I miss her very much . Ah , ah , ah . Let 's go ... Back to the picture . And tell me what else happened that day . We begged her ... Take your time . It 's almost over . My brothers and I ... We begged her to keep it . We wore her down . She said yes . We named him Fred . How did that make you feel ? Happy . Let me tell you about them . They are horrid creatures . Vile . Part organic tissue , part machine . It 's like everything from over there . They are loathsome . Hateful . Contemptible . Contemptible ? Is he doing the synonym thing again ? Uh , he was telling me about the shape-shifters , and now he 's moved on to the other Universe in general . Immoral . Evil . Walter , we have been over this . What is in the past is in the past . We have agreed to move forward . Even I don 't have drugs strong enough to forget they kidnapped Olivia to the other side . They did ? For weeks , that awful woman pranced around my lab . Awful woman ? Uh , the other Olivia . The one from over there . Oh . She bought my ignorance with baked goods while she carried out her plan to steal pieces of the machine with the-that damn Portuguese sweet bread . You mean the machine that created the bridge ? Yes . But that was not their intent . What they expected was for our world to be destroyed . Annihilated - Walter . It did not happen . That doesn 't mean that I have to like them . There 's another mirror in the back storage cabinet . Kennedy , help me . Lincoln . Thank you . No problem . Quickly ! Morning . Hi . What 's with the redecoration ? Walter . Hey , don 't look at me like I have some reasonable explanation . It 's Walter . Is Lincoln here already ? Mm-hmm . You did tell him he could come by to learn about shape-shifters , right ? Mm-hmm , but I didn 't think that he would beat me in . Well , he just lost his partner . Plus he is new in town . He doesn 't know anybody . He 's probably a little lonely . No . Not going to happen . Why not ? He 's cute . Because if I went out with him , then I would start having second thoughts , like I always do , and then he would get hurt , and then my workplace would become awkward . And you know what ? He 's not even my type . Do you ever think that maybe your type just doesn 't exist ? Dunham . I 'll be right there . 23 victims we know of , all following the same M.O. He drills into the back of the skull to access the brain . The tissue was punctured and exposed to localized electrical charges . But that 's not what killed them . The official cause of death : Cerebral hypothermia . A chemical agent was used to lower the brain 's temperature . They froze from the inside out . 23 murders . Why haven 't I heard of them ? Because these crimes weren 't committed over here . We 've been asked to assist on this case . Is that gonna be a problem ? Initiate scan . Scan complete . 22 murders , killer didn 't leave a single clue . Then , on the 23rd , we found a stray hair . DNA led us to John Louis McClennan . No prior arrests . " Show me " is up to date . Once we I.D. ' d him , we went to his house , ready to apprehend him , but he didn 't show up . - He 's disappeared . - He was ahead of you . With a 220 IQ , I imagine he 's way ahead of us . Five years we 've been looking for this guy . He was sloppy once . He 's not gonna make the same mistake again . So what do you need from us ? We need you to escort the John Louis McClennan from your side over to ours . Why ? To what end ? We 're hoping that he can give some insight into our Mr. McClennan . Look , I understand that they have the same DNA - I know all the reasons why not to do this . I 've been through them all with my own Colonel Broyles . Frankly , we 've got no options . Okay , well , why don 't you just interview him over here ? Because we want him to see where the killer was living . If-if he can , uh , interact with the space , study his belongings , he can glean something that we can 't . Well , you hope he can . Well , I lived in your apartment , and I picked up a lot of things about you . Will you excuse us a moment ? Okay , I get it . The accord was necessary . But this - this is different . Olivia , stop . Saving people 's lives is important . Of course it is . But-but I mean , have we even thought this through ? I mean , how can we both - It 's really not that complicated . Chain of command is simple . Over here , we 're in charge . Over there , they are . It is only simple if there 's trust . What about that tech we gave them that we took from the human shape-shifter ? I mean , have we even heard back ? Their science division is still working on it . I haven 't forgotten about that . Look . I know this is difficult for you . If there was any other way to execute this , I 'd ask someone else . Okay , how is this even gonna work ? Are we prepared to start telling civilians about the parallel Universe ? No . No , we don 't tell him anything . Professor McClennan won 't have to know where he 's been taken . He 's a professor ? And over there he 's a serial killer ? And we 're counting on similarities ? On our side , McClennan teaches Forensic Psychology at West Connecticut College . His area of study : Serial killers . Look , I don 't know if this is gonna work . But maybe it 's not so far-fetched , either . Uh , I 'm surprised . Read my article . I 'm-I 'm working on a follow-up , actually . I don 't think that we can underestimate the role that empathy plays in the structuring of the self , or-or the lack thereof . I 've profiled before for law enforcement , but I should say that , uh , this is the first time with the FBI . Are you willing to participate ? Agent Dunham , I have been working towards this my entire life . There 's a reason that we 've kept this out of the media . This case is highly classified . Okay . And one of the things that you are not able to know is where we 're going . Do you have any allergies to tranquilizers ? What happened to blindfolds ? Well , it 's a long journey , and I assure you , it 'd be more comfortable this way . Mm . No . No allergies . Come in . This is Agent Bergmann . He 'll be administering a mild sedative . Hm . Here 's to intrigue . Okay , thanks . Are we wired ? Good to go . Hey , Liv , it 's me . Yeah , come in . What do you think ? Blond looks good on you . Yeah , well , lucky Frank likes the red , huh ? I didn 't say I didn 't like the red . You look good in both . Thank you . - They 're pulling up . - Okay . Take it all the way down to the county road . That sounds like a good idea . All right , let 's go . Lock it up . Thank you . Moving now . It 's called in-Davidson 's available for transport . Lead vehicle , sat - Agent Dunham . We appreciate your help on this . Hello , Agent Lee . I button my jacket . So where do you want me ? We 've got audio surveillance in that vehicle . Mm-hmm . We 'll monitor from there . Okay , that 's fine . Showtime . You ready to do this ? Yep . Gotta gas it . Yeah , yeah . I think it 's the right one . I 'll check it out inside . Yeah , yeah . Can I do the windows ? I would love it if you would . Well done , my girl . That is beautiful work . You want a snack ? I want chips . Oh , that is shocking that you want chips . ♪ ♪ Walter . Walter ! Walter Do you have any idea how loud that was ? A man may soothe his soul . Walter , you found that soothing ? Do you have any idea what it cost Mozart to create that movement ? Walter , stop . What 's wrong with you ? Nothing . My nerves are a bit raw . I haven 't been sleeping well . I checked your meds , and the counts are way off . You 've been overdoing it . I 've been experimenting . Again . It 's okay . I 'm gonna help you get back on track . But if there is something else going on , you need to tell me . I need to rest . That 's all . Perhaps I 'll go lie down . He needs to feel in control . Messy spaces bother him . He 's highly intelligent . Hm . Probably self-taught . And he 's ... Fascinated by the brain . Germany . China . Uh , Thailand . Yeah , he ordered a lot of parts online from overseas for the schematics that he designed . Hm . Mm ... Hm . What are these for ? We don 't know . He needs to divert himself from his misery , so he builds things to occupy his time . You hate being out here , don 't you ? Why do you say that ? 'Cause it would drive her crazy . I 'm fine with it . Uh , egg hatching lights . My dad used to work on a farm . We had chickens for a while . I don 't know what he 'd be using this for . Does anything else stand out to you ? Hm ? Mm . Uh , he 's deeply unhappy . He grew up feeling deprived , and ... Other kids had things , and he-he didn 't . He 's trying to make up for it now , but ... He can 't . Dinner 's important to him . He hunts during the day . He blends into his surroundings . I have to go to the bathroom . Okay . Come straight back . All right ? I will . And don 't touch anything you don 't have to . I 'll just finish your job for you . Okay . What ? The chair . Uh , we had a set of chairs like that in-in the house that I grew up in . That 's crazy . It 's exactly the same . I loved that chair . Well . Hm . Oh , my . What do you think ? There 's too many of them . They 're-they 're - they 're strangers to him . Uh , he-he - he doesn 't know them . Why have them displayed ? Oh , because he 's jealous of them . Because he ... He hates that they have happy lives . That 's what he looks for . He takes them when they 're happy . His feelings are all that matter . He wants to feel better . Mom ? Mom ! How could he have this ? Do you know that man ? He 's my father . What is this ? What - is-is this some kind of a joke ? No , John , this is not a joke . Of course not . No , no , of course not . What the hell is going on here ? Why do you have a picture of my father ? Just calm down . And the same damn chair from my childhood ? You don 't understand . - It 's over . - Don 't . He 's my responsibility . Professor . Professor , wait . I 'm finished here ! Where am I ? See , I should 've removed the pictures . You took a calculated risk . I thought it would work too . Broyles didn 't want me to do it in the first place , and Charlie thinks that I 'm insane . Charlie 's on a beach sipping Mai-Tais with the bug lady . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Bug Lady . Right . Besides , it 's not over yet . I 'm gonna go in there . Give her a minute . Don 't . In this Universe , some things are the same , and some things aren 't . People ... make different choices and - and therefore end up in different places . I mean , this is ... like a nightmare . John , anything that you can tell us about him ... Anything will help . Anything . I don 't just understand him . I am him . What 's in him is in me . So what do you mean ? You 're not the only one with secrets . Go on . For as long as I can remember ... I knew something was wrong with me . My father - he knew it too . He saw the darkness . He-he used a ... heavy hand to try and fix me . The brutality of it , I mean , it was ... I al-I also came from an abusive home . My-my stepfather w - It 's no mistake that I-I do what I do . I want to understand myself . I want to help people like me . Have you ever acted on it ? No . But I 've wanted to . What stopped you ? Not what . Who . She-she helped me find just small ... moments of peace . Moments ... That I can hold on to . - Your mother . - No . My mother would ... Her-her name was Marjorie . And what my father did with cruelty she did with love . She taught me that I didn 't have to live in the darkness . That when I got the urges , that I c-I could just step out of it and into the light . This-this is crazy . This-this is - because sometimes when I , um , imagine what my life would 've been like without her ... This is it . Can I see you ? I wish I could tell him . And tell him what ? That it doesn 't have to be this way . That-that there 's a way . That he just had no one to-to-to , uh , to teach him . I mean , you said so yourself . Some things happened ... Some way in this world , and-and - and some didn 't , right ? That may be so . But John ... He can never know that you exist . You understand that . There 's no other road for him . Right . Her name is Noreen Miller . 32 . Okay , so when did this happen ? She disappeared from a gas station rest stop about an hour ago . The security cameras picked up an image of him just before she disappeared . There 's another victim ? Okay , John thinks he may be able to help you guys find him . Let 's go get him . - Where is he ? - Bathroom . It 's gone . What 's gone ? The photograph of his father . I take full responsibility , sir . I 'm the senior officer , and - Sir , Lincoln 's just trying to protect me . This was my idea . I 'm not interested in culpability right now . Do we have any leads ? We think we know where he 's going . You don 't sound entirely convinced . We-we - we think that he 's trying to find the killer . And why would he do that ? Because , we believe , he wants to stop him . We 're online . Professor John McClennan is not from here . The differences between his Universe and ours will take him time to comprehend , which will make it easier to track him . He does not have a " show me , " which means his access to public transportation is restricted . Although given a psychological profile , there 's a 43.2 % chance that under extraordinary circumstances , he would be willing to steal someone 's identification . I 'd say this is pretty extraordinary . Initial calculations indicate that there are 219 potential routes he could 've taken in the time he 's been missing , but the possibilities branch out exponentially the longer that he 's out there . Even with our facial recognition programs , going through that much data is going to take a long time . How long ? 13 hours , plus or minus . If you 're right , Agent Dunham , then finding Professor McClennan is our best chance to save Noreen Miller . Let me know when you have something . Yes , sir . I have an idea . You know , that woman processes more information in an hour than you and I will in a lifetime , so if she hasn 't thought of it , it 's not there . Yes , but she didn 't see the photograph of John 's father , and I did . Now , John said his father worked as a farmhand , so if we can trace the farm , then we - Yeah , but we can 't because John 's father didn 't own the farm , so his name wouldn 't be on it . I understand , but in the photograph , he was standing in front of a tractor with commercial plates . Pennsylvania , TR-53-879 . We can trace the registration . Weir Farm . Shut down ten years ago , after the Richboro fires . It 's been unoccupied ever since . Noreen Miller . Goes without saying , but I 'm still gonna say it . All necessary steps should be taken to bring her home unharmed . Any questions ? Let 's go . Ride with me . It doesn 't have to be like this . You don 't have to hurt her . You 're going for your.45 silver . You keep it in the toolbox . How did you know that ? How did you know that ? What are you ? That 's where he kept it . My dad . What are you ? I was like you . And then , one night in October , I - I went to a fair . I - I was ten . And that 's the night that my father found the dead things . Only I didn 't know that yet . I - I was playing carnival games , and I-I-I saw him coming toward me , and then I knew that he knew . The moment I saw him , I - I knew - that 's my life . That 's what happened to me . It was the ring toss that I was playing . Yeah . Me too . I hid . Behind the wagon wheel . But he found me . Grabbed me by the collar . His fingernails cut into my neck . He dragged me home , and he beat me for three days straight . Not me . I ran . As far , as fast , as long as I could . I woke up in a field , and this woman ... was standing over me . Her name was Marjorie . And because of her , I - I don 't have to do what you do to stop the pain . You can 't control it . - If you 're like me - - I can control it . - It can never stop . - She taught me how . No . This is the only way . I do this . And for a while - I can stop the urges . - It 's quiet . - No . I know the screams inside your head that won 't stop . It 's a horrible place to be . But I can help you . Like Marjorie helped me . You can step out of the darkness . Don 't you want the pain to end ? Yes . I can show you how . Maybe you can . What you said to John about your stepfather - you were trying to open him up , huh ? Yes . It 's also true . So what happened to him ? My stepfather ? I killed him . Get a lockdown perimeter going . Got it . Ah . Ah , ahhhhh . We are ready to begin . Tell me ... About your happiest memories . Tell me about Marjorie . Take the upstairs . Get the hallway . We 're clear ! Back room 's clear ! We got nothing , sir ! We 're all clear , sir ! Damn it . We 're in the wrong place . What are you thinking ? Over there . There was a structure here . Um , it could be anything . A shed , a barn . There 's another one . There was a group of structures here . This is where the family lived . How did Marjorie make you feel ? Safe . She was so kind . So gentle . I never understood how someone so beautiful could love something so dark . You ... Don 't have to do it ... Anymore . She 's sedated , but her pulse is strong . John , put your hands where I can see them . I wanted what he had . What she gave him . John , put your hands up . I took her from him . I shouldn 't have . She made him ... Feel for them . What have I done to all of them ? Marjorie ? What have I done ? How is the Professor ? There appears to be no permanent damage to his motor functions or cognitive ability . He is , however , suffering from partial memory loss . Partial ? He 's unable to recall the events of the last few weeks . He has no memory of ever being involved in this case . What about Marjorie ? His memories of Marjorie were extracted . The neurologists believe the loss is permanent . But for all we know , she 's the only thing that 's preventing him from - I know . Once he 's released , we 'll have to keep an eye on him . Can I talk to him ? He 's been told he was injured doing profiling work for the FBI . Okay . Hi . Do you remember me ? Nothing at all ? I 'm Olivia Dunham . I 'm one of the FBI agents who was working on the case . They tell me I saved a woman 's life . Yes . And probably many more . I came to say thank you . Just glad I could be of help . Do you remember Marjorie ? The other agent asked me that too . No . But things are pretty dark right now . Did she have something to do with the investigation ? Sort of . Feel better soon . You know what they say . That even when it 's the darkest , we can step into the light . He knows what she taught him , but he can 't remember who she is . How is that possible ? At the risk of sounding sentimental ... I 've always thought there were people who leave an indelible mark on your soul . An imprint that can never be erased . Walter , I 'm here . Who are you ? Can you hear me ? I 'm right here . No . Walter , I 'm right here . No , you 're not . I 'm here , Walter . You - you 're just a fig - a figment ! Walter , I 'm right here . I 'm here , Walter . Right here . Walter , I 'm here . Can you hear me ? I 'm right here . Walter . Help me , Walter . Please help me .

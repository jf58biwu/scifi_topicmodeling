 ALISON : My neighbour Aynsley always thought she was better than me . - You have to learn to forgive ... - Then I killed her . Listen , DeAngelis , you want Alison Hendrix , you show up tomorrow ... - ( GASPS ) - With my paperwork . Do you smell salt ? I may have spiked his tea . I don 't know what kind of game you 're running , Vic , but you better call me . Must 've been the pressure of Family Day . We want to take you to your children . You took my babies from inside me ! Your eggs . My father , he ... He made them whole for you . Hello , Helena . Take me to my babies . You gave me Kira 's stem cells ? It is a finite source . Unless you bring her in for more . ( CHOKING ) Cosima ! Rachel . Hello , Father . How is it the unmonitored tramp was successful ? In her fertility ? You are all barren by design . ( GRUNTS ) ( SCREAMS ) Leekie killed Rachel 's mother . My father sends his regards . It 's already over . Let me know when it 's done , yeah ? Go now . You might survive . - ( CAR HORN HONKING ) - Get in ! You ruined my marriage . I quit ! Where is Aldous ? Aldous suffered a fatal heart attack on one of our jets . I killed Dr Leekie . I cleaned the car . What are you doing ? I think those are his brains . - ( SIGHS ) - They 're congealed . Oh . Okay . Pitter-patter , Donnie . Come on , let 's get to it . - Donnie , grab it . - Well , you " re whipping it in my face . Do we ... You want to do the body like this ? Or like this ? I think we need to go ... - Diagonal ? - Yeah . Hold up . Hold up . If you 're not gonna hold it together ... Okay . No , I got this . I got this . I got this . DONNIE : You ready ? ( PANTING ) Oh ! Oh , God . Oh , God . I can 't . ( PANTS ) - I 'm going to throw up . - Don 't throw up , honey . Please , don 't throw up . It 's just asymmetrical , it 's difficult . I 'll lift it up . I 'll lift it up . ( BOTH GRUNT ) ( DONNIE SIGHS ) All right . You just hold on to Alexis 's hand there , she 's the midwife . I 've done this many times . You may feeljust a little bit of discomfort right now . ( SIGHS ) You 're doing very well , and you 're very strong . It 's just the catheter threading through the cervix . What is cervix ? Well , when the time is right , it 'll open wide enough to let the baby pass . Now , for the embryos . Those are my babies ? That 's right . Now , I 'm gonna inject these into your womb . And then they will implant themselves in the lining of your womb and they 'll start to grow , just as nature intended . And ... That 's it . God willing , in nine months we 'll be welcoming a brand new you into the world . Maybe even twins . RACHEL : How is she ? DELPHINE : The growths have spread from Cosima 's uterus and lungs to her oesophagus , all her epithelial tissue , and now her kidneys . You know there 's a way . Oh yes . But it 's Kira . Only until we can buy the time for Duncan to find a cure . We need to convince Sarah we have no designs beyond that treatment . Duncan was one thing , but her daughter ? Please . Things are different now . I 've been lied to as well . She won 't believe you . Do you ? I am in the middle , committed to my subject . Well said . ( SIGHS ) Dr Cormier , I 'd like you to take over as interim director of the program . Me ? The chair is vacant . You understand the human side and the science . You 'd be a wonderful ambassador . And you need to sway Sarah . It 's not a bribe . Or a ploy . You 're uniquely qualified . We could take this program in an entirely new direction . SARAH : So you 're the new Leekie . Interim . I didn 't ask for it . - ( SCOFFS ) Right . - We know what Rachel 's after . And my daughter already pulled out her own tooth , Delphine . I 'm sorry . Umm ... The stem cells had limited effect . The disease is spreading too rapidly . What about Duncan ? Gene therapy ? His synthetic sequences ? Even if we pinpoint the genetic cause , a therapy is months away at best . But if we can re-boot her immune system ... With my kid 's bone marrow ? Please . Rachel claims that she 's serious about forging a new relationship . - ( MRS S LAUGHS ) - Oh ... And you believe her ? I believe that she 's as invested in this as any of you . I don 't know if I trust Rachel . But at least we could save Cosima . I wouldn 't be here if it wasn 't her only chance . COSIMA : Yeah , it totally freaked me out but I 'm feeling way better . SARAH : Oh , Cosima . How about these nose tubes ? Sexy , right ? The new " la lingas . " ( LAUGHS ) ( COUGHS ) ALISON : I had no idea it was so bad , Cosima . ( SNIFFLES ) COSIMA : Oh , hey , don 't . Don 't , don 't , don 't , don 't do that , please . Just seeing you guys is making me feel better . SARAH : We wanna help , Cosima . But we 're not gonna bring Kira into Dyad . I ... COSIMA : Of course not . No , Sarah , I don 't want you to do that . I 'm so sorry I put you in this position . ALISON : And I feel like such a child . I mean , I 'm so , um , caught up in my own problems . ( SNIFFS ) COSIMA : No , dude . They 're real problems . How 's it going with Donnie ? Fine . ( WHISPERS ) Ask her . We 're working through it , you know ? SARAH : We 're gonna discuss things on our end and we 'll , we 'll get back to you soon . One thing . One final thing , um ... ( SNIFFS ) Did anything come of , uh , Dr Leekie 's demise ? ( COUGHS ) What do you mean , like ... ( CLEARS THROAT ) Officially he died on a private jet ? SARAH : Oh , that 's bullshit . ALISON : Uh , and so , what , no investigation , no body , nothing ? It 's Dyad . SARAH : They 'll do anything to keep the whole thing secret . Why say Leekie died on a plane ? He didn 't die on a plane . No . He died in your car . Yes , I 'm sorry . But why the Dyad cover story ? Maybe they think he 's dead . Maybe they told him to be dead and go live in Guadalupe , only he 's in our freezer . - I know what to do . - Oh you do , do you , Donnie ? Mmm-hmm . As long as no one finds a body , we 're clear . So we dump it in the lake . With weights . Do we have a boat ? Have you ever seen Dexter ? I mean , random scuba divers are finding everything . We can 't risk transporting him , Donnie . Fine ! Then we bury him in the yard . No . Not in the yard . ( BIRDS CALLS ON TV ) ( DRILLING ) - ( SIGHS ) - Just * let me do it . - I got this . - Donnie . All right , fine . You try it . Good luck . ( DRILLING ) How are you feeling ? I have gas . There 's plenty more of that to come . Now , let 's get you dressed . I have something I 'd like to show you . - This is our nursery and preschool . - ( CHILDREN GIGGLING ) Feel free to spend as much time here as you wish . You 're part of our family now . ( CHILDREN GIGGLING ) ( CHUCKLES ) Thank you . Thank you , Gracie , we 'll be all right . HENRIK : You look tired , Mark . Nightmares again . When I think about what you 've done for country , just 19 . And for what ? For profit , for glory ? ( SCOFFS ) They only ever gave me a mission , but ... You gave me a purpose . Well , I thank God every day that you went AWOL . Mark , it 's no secret that you and Gracie are ... Well , that you 're fond of one another . Don 't worry . Son , you 've got my blessing . ( SIGHS ) Thank you . But , Mark , it 's time for Gracie to bear fruit . So , what I need to know is , are you ready to stand by her as her husband ? It could work if it 's our own terms , our own security . I 'm not even sure if I want this on the table . ( SIGHS ) S , if there 's an option for Cosima , I have to consider it . - No . - Shh . Shh . Shh . Hey , God , Kira 's gonna hear you . Now , what 's going on ? I have a friend , works at a private paediatric clinic . She , she might be able to help us . But ... It 's not without risk . - Well , okay then , we 're not gonna do it . - ( SIGHS ) My sister 's dying , Fee . End of the day , it 's not your decision . MRS S : It 's not any of ours . Does Auntie Cosima need another tooth ? No , she needs something else now . Um ... Something called " bone marrow " . And they take it out of your hip . They have to use a ... a big needle . I don 't like needles . I know . I know . But they ... they , uh , they put you to sleep . So you don 't feel anything . You don 't have to feel bad , love , if you don 't want to do it . Will Aunty Cosima die ? ( CLICKS TONGUE ) She 's not doing too well . So , she might . Then ... Okay . Oh , God , you 're the bravest thing I know . ( SNIFFS ) I 'll make the call . I have her phone , she 's clean . So is the kit . Thank you , Benjamin . This is Dr Parks , she " ll be doing the procedure . - DR PARKS : Hello . - I 'll take you back - when you have what you need . - Okay . - Hello , Felix . - Delphine . Hey , you promise you 'll take care of Cosima , yeah ? Yes . Let 's see how Kira 's doing . You can wait right here until they 're ready for you . Okay . Are you going to stand there all day , Mr Funt ? I 'm here to help . Really ? And where did you get your genetics degree ? MARTIN : I can source another computer . Anything you need ? No , we 're good . Couldn 't get my hands on a 6502 processor , but this one shares a chip set with a 65C02 . He 's a virgin , in case you couldn 't tell . ( CHUCKLES ) ( COMPUTER BEEPS ) Ah , shoot-darn . It didn 't work . ETHAN : Oh , but it did , my good man . That 's the infertility sequence ? God , no wonder we 're all screwed up . It 's encoded . It 's a Vigenere 's cipher and I brought the key with me . I 'll need you to generate a transcription algorithm , Scott . This is just killer . ( CHUCKLES ) ( COUGHS ) ( PANTING ) Donnie , don 't . P * lease . Lord and butter , Donnie . Don 't spread it around . Keep it on the plastic . Look , this isn 't easy for me , all right ? Oh , I know . You 're not a tools guy , are you ? Not the tools , the whole thing ! I 'm not as perfectly comfortable with manslaughter as you . At least I had the good sense to leave mine where she dropped . He was in my car ! I can 't do anything ... - Mommy . - Hey-hey ! No , no , no , no . - Get out of here . Out , out , out , out . - Come on , get out . - Out . Out ! This isn 't some ... - But there 's a man here to see you . - Come on , let " s go . - Okay . Okay , out . Lock the door , Donnie . You . - Hi , Alison . - Get out of my house . VIC : Just , * listen ... Everybody upstairs . Go ! Everybody . I 'm staying . - Go ! - This is not a good time , Vic . Yeah , I can see that . What 's up with your garage ? - Renovating . - Oil change . Donnie , right ? I 'm Victor . Don 't talk to him . What do you want ? All right . Alison , we need to air ... ( SNIFFS ) Some things out ... for our recovery . You know , my stuff with Sarah , and how you two are related . And the thing you told me about Aynsley . - You told him ? - Told me what ? Uh , I don 't know . I don 't know . Please , man , talk to me . I 'm in a lot of pain . You get out of my house ! You 're cold , you know that ? Oh , give me a break . - You deserve her . - Out ! Adiòs , amigos . Yeah , that 's right . I think he 's gone . HENRIK : So , the doctor sailed north to the Arctic , amongst the icebergs , but his creation pursued him with a terrible vengeance . Because the doctor had never shown his creation any love . So , they finally came face to face . He sat down and they had a great big bowl of iceberg cream . Okay , children , nap time . Come on , let 's go . Now . One day , this room will be full of your children . It 's time to get ready , Gracie . ( CHILDREN LAUGHING ) ALEXIS : You 're not listening , Faith . FAITH : Ow . I just wanted to touch her hair . ( GRUNTS ) - Don 't talk back to me . - Ow , you 're hurting me . You 're lucky you 're not getting the strap . ( SLAPS ) FAITH : Ow ! ALEXIS : It 's nap time . Do as you 're told . Shall we head back then ? ( GRUNTS ) There was a woman in convent like you . You touch her again and I will gut you like a fish . ( GASPS ) ( MONITOR BEEPING ) I 'm gonna be here the whole time , okay ? I 'll hold your hand , yeah ? Can you count back from 100 , Kira ? One hundred . Ninety-nine . Ninety-eight . Ninety-seven . Sleep tight , monkey . FELIX : Okay . Yeah . ( SIGHS ) She ... She won 't feel a thing , I promise . What kind of mother am I ? DELPHINE : The best and the bravest . FELIX : It 's all right . And a very , very good sister . Oh , God . I am sorry . ( MONITOR BEEPING ) This is the last one . She 'll wake up in a few hours . But she should rest here tonight . She will be fine in a couple of days . And Cosima ? This ... gives her a real chance . - ( SARAH SNIFFLES ) - FELIX : All right , sweetie . ( GRUNTS ) ( GUN COCKING ) Ah , ah , ah , don 't move . I 've used this before and I 'll do it again . - Come on , take it easy , bro . - Get up . - Take it easy . - Get up ! - I wasjust looking for your washroom . - Let 's go . Shut up . ALISON : You used me in rehab and now you 're harassing my kids . And , and peeping in my garage . Alison , it 's not what you think . I don 't really give a shit what you 're doing ... I think I shou * ld shoot him , A * li . - I ... Donnie , don 't . - That 's how I see this ending . It doesn 't have to be that way , buddy ! Donnie , please relax ! Baby , I 'm telling you this is a hair-trigger . One second you 're here , the next second , bang ! Christ , I don " t want to die . You can 't shoot me , there 's a cop outside . All right ? There 's a cop in the van outside ! Angela DeAngelis ? Alison , she 's been squeezing me . I don 't even think it 's official , Alison . She thinks there 's five of you . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - There 's eleven , ese . - ( SIGHS ) Why you got to keep messing with my head like that ? Not so tough , are you , huh ? Safety 's on . - You were bluffing ? - Yeah . I learn from my mistakes , Alison . You 're not gonna shoot me ? Not accidentally . God , I hate this garage . This is how we take care of this family from here on . That was quick . Whoa ! Hey ! Hey ! What do you think you 're doing , man ? I 'm Donnie Hendrix . And you 've been harassing my wife . This is police business . DONNIE : My ass , it is . Beth Childs police business ? How about Art Bell ? Suspended for doing far less than this . All these women and you just can 't put it together , can you ? - I 'm confused , too . - Shh . You don 't want to know what we know . And if you come near my home , or my family again , I will bury you . Smile . Have a shitty day . ( HELENA SNORTS ) Wel * I , now that you 're both in a family way , you can keep each other company . ( SNORTS ) ( CHUCKLES ) You are sad to be pregnant ? Might as well eat . You will be fat soon , anyway . ( LAUGHS ) I thought you liked Mark . You don 't get it , do you ? My ... my father is the father . I 'm carrying your babies . My babies in your cervix ? For your genes , Helena . Haven " t you been listening to anything my father says ? Not really . Okay , one adapted transcription algorithm . It was Susan 's sterility concept . Degrade the endometrium , prevent ovarian follicles from maturing . Okay . Horrifying . Why an auto-immune condition ? Why not ... Tweak our hormones ? Or , or modify our reproductive organs somehow ? Normal development was the prime directive . This was the least invasive solution . Unfortunately we didn 't , um , foresee the consequences . SCOTT : And key meet code . - Done . - Thank you . And now , Cosima , we can begin the task of correcting my mistakes . How long will it take to decode the remaining sequences ? Well , that depends on Dyad 's intentions . - Is that right ? - Yes . Each sequence has a distinct key . And I have no intention of sharing them just to allow Dyad the opportunity of perpetuating this experiment . No offence , Cosima . None taken . Hello , Gracie . Are you well ? She has no idea . He puts babies in all these women ? Yes , to multiply is divine . Try and eat something , Gracie . Please ? ( MAKING KISSING SOUND ) You love her like puppy . But you let him make her broodmare . The women here don 't see it that way . Tel * I her , Gracie . Hmm . Marion . Oh . You caught me reminiscing . Aldous certainly filled this room . Yes . He had a way . Heart attack on one of ourjets ? I 'm bereft . Dr Cormier is an interesting choice for the chair . She 's telegenic . She has scope . And an intimate relationship with her subject , always handy . How are you , Rachel ? Besides bereft . You 've learned a lot about yourself lately . Tell Jobside that Rache * I is fine . I know what our goals are . And I 've only just taken charge . I 'm glad to hear it . But this is a personal call . Sarah Manning intrigues me . Doesn 't she you ? Biologically , yes . But it 's not just her biology that 's gotten her this far , is it ? You were bred into this . Given every advantage . But Sarah ... Sarah is a product of chance . Yet here we are at loggerheads with her . She 's in hand . I assure you . ( INDISTINCT VOICES ) Sorry , Dad , they 're all gone . MOTHER : That 's right . Sorry , love . They 'rejust meant for us . FATHER : No ! That is outrageous . Well , I 'm going to have to come after you and tickle you . ( LAUGHING ON TV ) I love you too , Daddy . I love you too , Daddy . FATHER : Thank you , darling . Stupid . Stupid . Stupid . ( LAUGHING ON TV ) RACHEL : Dr Neelan . Yes . It 's Rachel Duncan . I 'm fine . Yes , of course . It 's a terrib * le * loss . But it 's not why I 'm calling . I need your expertise . You 've done it . Well , not yet . But we have the marrow processing for a transplant . Then , thank you for letting me use your office . Oh . Well ... ( MOBILE RINGING ) Martin , yes . Sorry . ( COMPUTER BEEPING ) RACHEL : Good . What time ? Thank you . Bye . SARAH : Okay . Here you go . Good girl . Yuck . Yucky . Time to sleep now for a bit . Yeah ? There you go . W-What are you doing ? I don 't belong here . But , where will you go ? To my sestra . You 're a good girl , Grace . But if you don 't want to have my babies , don 't have my babies . I would never do that . ( SIGHS ) I 'm coming with you . This way , it 's faster . You disappoint me , daughter . Go back to your beds . No , father . We trusted you to counsel her , to help her embrace her purpose . I 'm not afraid of you . Neither am I. Mother 's gone out west to find more broodmares . Both of you can go to hell . ( GRUNTS ) Oh , Gracie . What would your mother say ? ( SCREAMING ) - No ! No ! ( GRUNTING ) - ( GRUNTS ) I hate you ! I hate you ! Gracie ? HENRIK : Leave her a * lone , Mark . She 's got a lot of thinking to do . Mark ! Come and help me with Helena . She 's your daughter . Yes , Mark . You had to put your own child inside of her ? You had to be the father , too ? Helena is a mirac * le , Mark . She defies the laws of science . It is a sign that I cannot ignore . You 're not locking Gracie up anymore . ( HENRIK GRUNTING ) Gracie . Gracie . Gracie . HELENA : Go ! Run . Run ! Come on . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) I 've always wanted to do that . What ? It 's okay , I didn 't put our initials in it . I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now . ( PANTING ) ( GRUNTING ) - Take this off . - Oh , yeah . ( BOTH GRUNTING ) The bedroom . No . - Workbench . - No , no , no . BOTH : The freezer . ALISON : Oh my God ! I wanna be nasty . Come on , Donnie . ( MOANS ) ( GRUNTING ) Helena ? Helena , what are you doing ? Why do you sound so scared ? Helena . We saved you . Ooh . Helena , I am the father of your children . They are going to need me when they get older . Daddy , how do they make babies ? Would you like ... horse baby ? ( SNIFFS ) Cow baby . Is this how you do it ? You 've made your point . This isn 't funny . Do I look like I 'm trying to be funny ? Helena . Helena . Oh . Don 't do this . Oh , no . Don 't . Helena . Helena ! Arghhh ! ( LAUGHING ) Hey , chicken . I don 't know why ... Delphine 's here . She 's outside . What 's going on ? I saw something about that man that works with you . Benjamin Kertland . I couldn 't call . They could be listening . What is it ? You must not overreact or they will know . Tell me . Rachel may have compromised him . Shit . Sarah ? Sarah , wait . Be carefu * I. What does she want ? To warn us . Rachel 's making a move . - What kind of a move ? - I don 't know . I 'll be with Kira and you make sure the elevators are secure . Hey . Hey . Hey , hey , what 's going on ? We 're not safe here . What are you talking about , eh ? - Where are you gonna take her ? - ( MOBILE RINGING ) I don 't know yet . I 'll let you know . - Sa ... - ( GRUNTS ) - ( GRUNTS ) - Pleasure to meet you , Felix . Where did you come from ? - Keep him away . He 's with Dyad . - MRS S : What ? BENJAMIN : What are you talking about ? I 'm not with Dyad . Oh my God . SARAH : No ! Felix . MRS S : Oh , Felix . SARAH : Felix , wake up . Oh , shit . - Oh , shit . - He 's been drugged . - Felix ? - You . What did you do ? - Nothing . - MRS S : Sarah , I thought it was you . It was a trick . Rachel 's taken her . MRS S : Fe * lix , come on . Felix ? What 's wrong ? ( SNIFFS ) I made a terrible mistake . What have you done ? ( WHIMPERS ) Mommy ? Hello . My name is Rachel . How are you feeling , Kira ? Where 's my mom ? Where 's Mrs S ? Dear child ... I know how frightening this must be for you . But ... you 'll get used to it . You may even grow to like it here . Just as I did . And if I refuse ? You 'll be on the plane . You used me ! You forget , Dr Cormier , none of this is personal . DELPHINE : If you let her die without me , it is personal . Is my mom here yet ? - Soon . - SARAH : I left her with you for five bloody minutes ... MRS S : You left her with ... SARAH : And she 's gone now ! SARAH : My name is Sarah Manning . ( GRUNTING ) And this is my unconditional surrender . Ripped By mstoll

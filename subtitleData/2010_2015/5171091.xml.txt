 Wake up . Wake up . Hello . Is this geoff ? Yeah . This is samuel , here . We were expecting you this morning . Oh , samuel , uh ... I completely passed out . Okay . We 'll see you soon . Geoff burton for samuel mead , please . Injecting room here , got your stereo microscope ... Quarantine room for incoming animals ... Microscope room with confocal imaging station . All the usual stuff . Spinning disc confocal ... Two photon confocals ... Upright confocals with dipping lenses ... All the laser lines you could wish for ... Anything to make science beautiful . We 've got a cold room . We 've got a microbial culture room The auto glazer , downstairs . Um , there 's an elevator ? How 's your accommodation , geoffrey ? Oh , fine , fine . I was just wondering where my office Is gonna be . Oh , we don 't really do offices , per se . We 're more communal than that . Of course , we can loan you a lab For the duration of a given project . Right . Look who I 've found ... - Dr. Burton . - Dr. Fiedler . Rebekka 's come a long way Since she was interned with you . Yes , so I hear . I 'm sorry , I can 't leave this right now . We 'll catch up later . Great . - Shall we continue ? - Yes . That way . Now , there 's something else we need to do . Sorry , I didn 't ... Erm ... Anyway ... Let 's get your security pass sorted out . Son of a bitch . Oh , geoff ... How are you ? I 'm fine . You ? Hmm ... I 'm good . Setting up the new research lab . Uh , the one in munich , right ? Uh , no . Dresden , remember ? You must be happy . What 's that supposed to mean ? It 's ... It 's nothing . - Forget about it . - Hey , babe . I 'm home . Hold on for a second . So , uh ... What 's up ? I heard about your news . When were you planning to tell me ? I was going to tell you . I really was ... I 'm in my second month and I ... I wasn 't quite sure , and ... I didn 't tell anyone else . Well , joe and carla knew . Oh . No , that was ... That was ben . Right ... Ben . He was excited about the baby So he jus-just told them , you know ? You 're angry . No ... Of course ... I 'm not angry . I 'm just ... I dunno , I gotta think about it . Think about what ? Well what do you want me to say ? Congratulations ? Maybe you could be happy for me . What do you want ? Why did you call me ? I don 't know why I called . I miss you . I have to go . Geoffrey burton comes to us from umass , Where his research into the early detection Of embryonic abnormalities ... One of the more , uh , furiously debated topics Of the scientific community this decade . Now , I don 't need to tell you What the implications of this are ... The proverbial cure for cancer Has always eluded us . The potential of prenatal discovery Certainly brings the possibility a few steps closer . To continue his research in a rather less politicized environment . And he 's going to speak to us all this morning ... About the state of his work to date . When you 're ready . Thank you . Would you now all please join me In welcoming ... Geoffrey burton . Thank you . Thank you , samuel . I never intended to become a geneticist . My ph.D. Was actually on bacterial biochemistry . But , as I 'm sure many of you know I was drawn to this by my experience With my own son ... To focus my research on screening embryos For traces of rare genetic mutations . Such as his . I want to make one thing very clear : I 'm not trying to develop new techniques To prescreen people with brown eyes or dark skin ... Or freckles . I like freckles . Diversity ... One of the things Which defines us as a species Is to be celebrated . Mutations ... Which endanger human life ... Are not . For example ... Here we see the subject In the earliest stages ... The disease is non-contagious In the traditional sense . Yet , at the same time , unusually virulent . I 've allowed myself the conceit of calling it ... Burton syndrome . What made this syndrome noteworthy Was its sudden appearance In what appeared to be a perfectly healthy subject . Within a matter of days , the ... Symptoms had manifested As a number of neoplasms ... Exponentially multiplying and growing in size . These , uh ... Tumor-like appendages Eventually cover the entire body , As we can see . Respiration became increasingly difficult ... Began to affect internal organs ... Crushing the heart ... Constricting the lungs . Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter . From first symptoms to death , The entire process took little over a week . What made this unique was that this was not An acquired disease like a virus , But a seemingly ... Random genetic mutation ... Occurring in the gene rip-5 on chromosome 20 . Alright . Let 's take a closer look at some tissue samples . May I sit here ? People don 't want to know The way things happen . This fish , for example ... No one wants to think of it ... Suffocating ... In agony . We just want to fry it ... Eat it ... Forget . Same with science . People want the cure ... But not the research . It makes them uncomfortable , Knowing how you got there , What you had to do . To what ... It 's true . I would like to live a million years ... Just to see what we evolve into . Do we become telepathic ? Do we get wings ? I would like wings . And you ... What would you like ? I don 't know , uh ... I can be a time traveler . You know , travel through time , Backwards and forwards ... Chiba ... I don 't think your patent 's done yet . Hello . I 'm jarek novak . Geoffrey burton . We actually met yesterday . I almost ... Liberated your mouse . - I didn 't know it was you . - It 's me . Your lecture , I really like it . Great images . Thank you ... I guess . I was thinking ... Maybe you would like to have a look At some things I 've been working on . We kind of , similar vein , you know ? Yeah ? Why not ? Good . We should have a drink . - Sure . - What about tonight ? Excuse me a minute . Excuse me . Sorry . No , thank you . I quit . - You quit ? - Yeah . I guess it has been a while Since I 've seen you last . Yeah , that was your choice . I 'm sorry . You know , I ... I don 't want it to be awkward . I don 't , either . You know , I have been watching you , though . You know , I 've been watching you rise . Read all your papers . Very impressive . You 're the one who got samuel To approach me , right ? You know , I ... I felt like I 'd hit a wall With my research , and ... You know I-I heard what you were dealing with In america , so ... I thought , perhaps , you 'd like to come over . I , uh ... I don 't know , I ... To be honest , I didn 't expect you to say yes . What have I said " yes " to ? I can show you . Let 's go back . Good , ' cause my ass is cold . Have a seat . Okay ... So ... Now , here ... Okay , this is a typical regeneration cycle , About ten weeks from amputation to full regeneration . Yes ? Yes . Okay , so now ... Watch this one . Did you see ? Uh ... Missed it . I 'll play it again . Watch closely . You 're kidding , right ? That 's not possible . When I inserted the easter gene , I found it accelerated the natural regeneration capacity Of the axolotls way beyond anything I could have imagined . But , since then , I 've refined The genetic code further . Just ... Wait a minute . What easter gene ? What are you talking about ? Look . I labeled only the transplanted Easter gene cells ... With a gfp . They were localized in the wound area , But then they completely took over . Look for yourself . That 's , uh ... I 've even had success regenerating severely damage Brain and spinal tissue . I mean , can you imagine the possibilities For this in humans ? Jesus christ ... Exactly ... Easter . Why haven 't you published this ? I don 't know . A discovery is not a cure . Even so , I mean ... It won 't even uptake in mice . What happens when you try ? Nothing . I 've been stuck for six month , now . And then , I thought , if anybody could help me With the molecular mechanism ... To help me activate it in mammals ... Hmm ... You know , I 'm sorry , I 've got an appointment With samuel right now , but what do you think About , you know , discussing this later , Over dinner ? - Yep . - At my place ? - What are you doing tonight ? - Nothing . Hm . I can cook something for you . - German ? - I like german . Don 't worry . It 's not a date . Hey ! Hey ... Looks like we are having a drink tonight , after all . It is not together . Come on , I 'll give you a lift . I 'm not going back to the guest house , so ... It 's cold . Come on . Alright . Want to try electrical cigarette ? Uh , no . I 've got my own . Real cigarette . Ah ... I 'm sorry , but , uh ... It 's a non-smoking car . Of course . Sorry . It 's okay . Where are we going ? Oh , right ... Sorry , uh ... Uh .. Fodenhau ... Foten ... Can I see it ? Ah , pfotenhauerstrasse ... Yes . I know it . Good . That 's where we 're going . I know you , also ... - ... Very well . - Yeah , you do ? - Yes , the science . - Hmm . We are the same , both of us . How do you figure ? You know ... Taking risks , whatever it takes . A new , brave world . Yeah , I haven 't read that one . I have ideas . You have saved myself , uh , brilliant experiments . You could be part of them . Well , that 's a very kind offer , My work 's kind of a full time thing right now Why 'd we stop ? You know mosquitos , bed bugs , fleas , ticks ... They 're all vectors for disease , yes ? But instead of spreading sickness , Why not change the formula ? Make them carry genetically modified viruses ... Antigenes for their own plague . Imagine releasing this in the third world ... In africa . Hm ? They 're going to be bitten , anyway . So why not let them catch ... Malaria vaccine , instead ? But then , first you would have to ... Invent the malaria vaccine , right ? You don 't think it 's possible ? I didn 't say that . You know stalin , mao tse-tung ... ? Both of them believed you could transfer ideology By breeding one indoctrinated generation to the next . And , eventually , you would get Genetically programmed communists . I mean , I know this sounds maybe a little ... Crazy ... But ... There were some really good ideas in there . But , look , uh ... What good ideas are we talking about , really ? - You 're not getting my point . - What is your point ? There is the idea ... And there is making people believe in the idea . And that is the key to scientific freedom . And financing . Exactly . And you need that freedom To be able to get the good ideas . Because they can come from unexpected places . Like your son , for example . You know ... I 'm gonna walk from here . Say hello to rebekka from me . So why didn 't you call me ? I could have picked you up . I got a lift . Well , sort of ... Half a lift . From that jarek guy at the institute . What 's up with that guy ? I don 't have much to do with him . Oh . Don 't you get enough of these at work ? I find them beautiful . You know , they are such strange and resourceful organisms . There is nothing quite like them on earth . Mm-hmm . You don 't agree ? I kinda always saw them as redundant . You know , genetic dead ends . But , then again , after what I saw today ... Who knows ? What about this ? They 're called wunderkammer . What ? Wunderkammer . To display things that hadn 't been classified yet . I 'm creating new wonders . So you 're an artist , now , and a scientist . Come on , let 's eat something . - Alright , go on . - You 're not in training , so ... - Tell me . - What ? Tell me . - What ? - What do you think ? Tell you what ? About this easter gene of yours . Why do you think I 'm here ? I 'll tell you everything , on one condition . Okay . You have to agree to work with me . Yeah , okay . Sure . To fruitful collaborations . - Okay , that 's good ... - Okay . Because I need your brain . Just my brain . Alright , a little much ... You had a big impact on me , you know ... Did I ? You were this unreachable ... Kind of ... Star scientist ... Whatever . Intelligent and ... Inspiring , and ... Intimidating , of course , too , sometimes . - Hmm . - I mean , even now ... What you 're doing , it 's ... Brave , I suppose . Why is that ? - Forget about it . - No , no , no , no ... I think I 'm a little drunk . You tell me . Just ... Using your son like that ... In the lecture ... I can 't imagine what that must be like . I 'm sorry . - That 's alright . - I didn 't mean to say that . Yeah you did . Come on , geoff . I 'm not criticizing you . You know I haven 't published Anything significant in four years ? Publish or perish , remember ? Isn 't that what we used to say ? They were forcing me out of umass . But you knew that , right ? They were cutting my funding Until my lab was unworkable ... Waiting for me to quit . They couldn 't fire me . That would make them look bad . You know , my boy ... He was the only case . And it killed him . I 'm just trying to find something positive Out of all this . You know if ... I don 't , then ... What 's the point ? But you 've made progress . I think I should go . - I 'm still a little tired , jet lagged ... - Geoff ... Dinner was nice . I 'm gonna go . Wait ... You look nice , by the way . See you tomorrow . No fucking idea ... hi , it 's sarah . I am not available At the moment , please leave a mess ... Scheisse . [ Shit ] Where is it ? Put it in the fridge . She will notice if we take anymore . She 's got a whole rack of them . Anyway , we are doing her a favor . Her research is a dead end . You 're such a thoughtful guy ... - So devoted to her ... - Fuck off . Pass me the next one . Come on , it is not time for sleep . Okay , wait . I have some pussy remedy for you . One for me ... And one for you . Take it . Aaaaaaah ... Okay . You know margaret thatcher ... Our woman ? She only sleep four hours a night Huh ? Think about it . None of it was beauty sleep . Very strong woman . I know that . I 'm hungry . I need to eat something . I 'm hungry , I need to eat something . Okay . Let 's take a break , come on . Take it off . You know , margaret thatcher sleep , uh .. Maybe 12 years in her life . Normal person ... Sleeping ... 25 years . You ... 50 . Ow ! Son of a bitch . - Hello . - Hello . What are you doing here ? Just working late . In the mouse house ... Is that where I am ? These hallways all look the same . Excuse me . What 's wrong ? I don 't know . He 's in pain . Do something . Help him . He 's in pain ... What 's he doing with you ? Come on ... Uh ... Ah , shit . I 'm sorry . Okay ... Excuse me ... I love your genes . Yes . Oh , geoffrey ... Excellent timing . Come in . Take a seat . Geoffrey burton ... Jarek novak . Yes . We 've , uh , met . Jarek and rebekka made the initial breakthrough With the easter gene . I presume she 's filled you in by now . Yeah , she mentioned it . I 'm sure jarek , here , can bring you up to speed . Yes . You 're staying at the guest house , right ? Mm-hmm . I can just pop by when it suits you . What is your room number ? Oh , well , just ... I 'll call you . - You have my number ? - No . I 'm sure someone can help you . He means well , he just forgets , sometimes , He 's not the only horse on the track . Yeah , but do you trust him ? I trust all my staff . Yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Danke . [ Thank you ] Danke schön . [ Thank you very much ] - Bad news ? - Hmm ? Just the usual administrative headaches . Our funders are very generous , They allow us a good deal of latitude ... But they 're just so impatient . And that 's where I come in ? You 're an asset to our team , geoffrey . You wouldn 't be here if you weren 't . But I do admit , I hope you 're excited About what jarek has to show you ... Perhaps even enough to give him the benefit You see , that 's where I 'm still confused . I 'm sorry , but ... Are you asking me to collaborate With both jarek and rebekka ? Well , that 's up to you . I can hardly tell you to stop your own research , After all , I mean ... That 's why you 're here . But you must admit , This is a rather unique opportunity . See , I was under the impression That this was rebekka 's project , That the easter gene was ... Her discovery . - Always bickering over who did what , and when - yeah ... Actually , geoffrey ... Just between you and I ... This is a bit of a tricky situation . Rebekka has refused to collaborate with him any further . Yeah ? Why is that ? I don 't know , but I can hardly Throw him off the project . So what 's he working on down there ? I 've got him doing some genotyping ... Tinkering away , alone in the dark . It 's what suits him best . On mice . On axolotls . He does have some ... Mice thing ... His pet project ... Viral vectors , and so forth . Geoffrey ... Meet with him . I like to thaw him out , sometimes . Is there something wrong ? No , no ... I 'm just ... Trying to get my bearings , is all . Excuse me . I 'm just finishing up some embryos . It 's so funny , I thought this morning We are like the yin and yang of mitosis . You work on cell proliferation out of control , cancer ... Me , on perfect cell harmony . So what 's the story with that jarek guy ? What do you mean ? What about him ? I don 't know . Just seems kinda secretive . It 's kinda weird . I don 't know , samuel thinks he 's some kind of genius . And with you ? What do you mean ? Were you and he ever , uh ... Are you joking ? Just asking . So what 's he actually working on ? I don 't know what he 's working on . He doesn 't want to tell me . To be honest , I don 't really care . Something related to the easter gene , maybe . Scheisse . [ Shit ] Rebekka , samuel told me . - Told you what ? - About the easter gene ... It wasn 't just your discovery , was it ? - It 's my discovery . - But not yours , alone . I 'm not a liar , geoff . Look , I just want to know What you 're getting me into , here . You say we 're working together , fine ... But I don 't even know whose ... Research it is , anymore . I-I don 't even know who 's involved . Jarek isn 't involved in what I 'm doing . - You did work with him . - Only briefly ... In the very early stages . I didn 't like his style . He was too reckless . He tried to dominate my project . I threatened to quit If samuel didn 't take him off . In the end , I won . Well , according to samuel , he 's still on it . It 's cosmetic . You might want to see this . - Where did you get this ? - I retrieved it ... From the mouse house , and I suggest you change your locks . Jarek 's got a clandestine lab set up , and I 'm ... Yeah , I 'm pretty damn sure he 's trialling your easter gene On mice . What do you want to do about it ? - I 'll deal with it . - How ? - I 'll talk to samuel . - Why ? Why don 't we ... - ... Just confront ... - It won 't help . It 's my research , okay ? I want to deal with it my way . You have to trust me . Okay . Do something , geoff . Help him . I 'll take care of it , okay ? I 'll fix it . I 'm gonna take just a little bit of blood . Just a minute . Hi . What 's with the glove ? I , um ... Just doing some dishes . So ... What are you doing here ? I 'm taking you to the party . - Haven 't you seen the signs ? - No . It 's our big ... Anyal ... - " Annual . " - ... Annual get-together . You have to come . Everybody will be there . I don 't think so . You have no choice ... You 're my date . Woop ! Looks like you got started early . Is that wrong ? No . - You want some more ? - Bitte . [ Please ] What ? You know what that means , " bitte ? " [ Please ] - No . - Yeah , I thought so . So what 's up with the trench coat ? Holy shit . It 's an axolotl ! Don 't you get it ? Me , the axolotl woman ... Woo . - right , ' cause ... - It 's a costume party ! - I see . Aww , come on ... - ... I have an idea for you . - Oh , god . Come . Come on . Ooh ! I 'm sorry ! This is insane . This guy 's trying to steal your ... Geoff , you know , I don 't want To create a fuss , okay ? I know how to handle jarek . It has to be done discreetly . Uh huh . Listen to me , I know what I saw . They were fully grown mice , not embryos . Geoff , please , can you just ... Can you just leave it ? Just for tonight , please ? I-I ... I want to have some fun , Feel human for a change , please . Okay ? Just tonight . One night ? Promise ? Promise . Now , hold still . One more thing ... Just , wait ... What ? You know , it 's not boston . I 'm not your intern , anymore . You don 't have to feel guilty . Why did you bring me here ? Hm ? Hold still . Was it for work , or was it to start something again ? What if I said both ? Then I 'd say it 's not a very good idea . It 's not that I don 't think you 're attractive ; I do . It just feels too ... Yeah , okay . - You 're finished . - What ? - Rebekka ... - Here , put that on . I 'll go warm up the car . Hey . Oh , there they are . Hey , woo ! Hey ! Have you both met ? I need a drink . Do you want anything ? Thanks . They dream . Did you know that ? When drosophila lose contact from the ground ... They fly ! It is instinct . So we put them in a flight simulator ... And blow banana wind ... Smell of banana ! Eventually , they sleep from exhaustion , Yet we still detect brain activity From olfactory bulbs ... Representing the patterned reaction To banana smell ! Which means ... Sleeping fruit fly dream of banana ! Are you her new boyfriend ? Think you will get lucky tonight , huh ? You 've been there before , right ? Professor 's privilege ? By the way ... I want my mouse back . Your mouse ? Yes . My mouse . Give me one good reason Why I wouldn 't just go to samuel And tell him what you 're up to . What I 'm up to ? Tell me . What am I up to ? Well , I know you 've stolen rebekka 's research . I saw your stupid lap dog break into the lab . There is no " her research " and " my research . " We are just one big organism . Did someone tell you that ? No ? Well , you see , that would ... Make " your mouse " " our mouse , " then . And our mouse tells me ... You 've been trialling the easter gene on animals . I also know it 's working . What I don 't know , is ... How you did it . So , go on . Tell me how you did it . I guess you will have to wait and read my paper . Like everybody else . Stop ! Stop it ! You want doctor ? It 's his own fault . Fuck him . Come . Hello . I 'm sorry . It 's going to need some serious stitches . You okay ? Hey ... What ? No . No . Geoff , what are you doing ? Let 's make it right . You 're awake . Oh , your fever is gone . You really scared me last night . What are you doing ? It 's quite the dossier , here . You always go through people 's stuff ? You didn 't want me to see it , why is it just lying around ? You know , I saw jarek at the club . We had a nice little chat . Why ? Why did you do that ? Why not ? I saw him grab you , I saw you ... Talkin ' to him last night , after work . That 's what I thought . So , what ... ... What do you want me to say ? How about the truth ? Okay , I had a little fling with jarek . So what ? It was stupid . So stupid . At least I knew who I was fucking . You called me sarah last night . I was delirious . What 's your excuse ? Why do I need one ? Listen , I don 't care if you were ... Sleeping with some freak ... What I do care about is that Everything you 've been telling me lately Sounds like bullshit . Okay , then let 's just define bullshit for a moment , shall we ? What 's bullshit is ... That you were never going to leave her , Despite everything you told me . I never said anything that would make you ... You think that didn 't hurt ? I was frightened . You know , it wasn 't just a little crush on my professor . I was scared that it could get out , and ... My career would suffer . That was a long time ago . You need to move on . Get out . Get out ! You know ... You have no idea ... What I 've had to deal with . Oh , come on , geoff ... Deal with ? You haven 't dealt with anything . Uh , she 's not available right now . - Is this geoff ? - Just put my wife on , please . She 's not your wife , anymore . And she doesn 't want to talk to you . Yes ... She does . Every time you call , you upset her . - I 'm sick of it . - Just put her on , ben . Hey , who the fuck ... Oh , you fucking ... Fucker . " squek " Come on . Answer the phone . Where 's rebekka ? Up on the roof . Hi . I need your help . Rebekka , please ... What is it you want from me ? I can 't tell you here . Here . - I need you ... - What 's that ? - ... To do a blood test . - Yeah , of course . - You can run a pcr , right ? - Yeah . What are you doing ? What does it look like I 'm doing ? Can you please just tell me what 's going on ? - You 're scaring me . - I was bitten by a mouse . - A ... A lab mouse ? - Yes . And I 'm pretty sure I contracted a virus . That 's not possible . These are the most pathogen-free mice In the world . Not if they belong to jarek . We need a sample from you , too , for the negative . - I know how it works , geoff . - Then do it ! What am I supposed to be looking for ? Your easter gene ! Jarek 's using a viral vector to integrate it Into the mammal genome . Not embryos ... Fully grown mice . He scooped you on the mammals . I 'm sorry , he did it . But I don 't know how . What ? I 'm the proof . You know what , you 're right . Screw the test . - Where are you going ? - Where 's jarek ? I don 't know ... Yes , you do . Probably the mouse house . Mouse house ? What are you doing ? What do you think ? Please ... Let me call samuel . Oh , now you 're gonna call . Call samuel , and get him to the mouse house , right now . Let 's think about this . - I 'm done thinking . - Where 're you going ? Stop ! Stop ! " squeak " is spelled with an " a , " asshole ! For your survival ... Get the hell out of here ! It was infectious . What are you talking about ? Your mice ! It was infectious ! Get this crazy ass off of me ! Tell me ! Stop it , please ! Stop it ! Jarek ! Get back ! - Jarek ... - Get back . Jarek ... What 's wrong , jarek ? This is exactly what you wanted , wasn 't it ? Huh ? Get back ! What 're you gonna do ? I mean it . Do it . Get back ! What the hell is going on here ? He just went crazy ! He was attacking us . Don 't listen to him , samuel . These guys infected me . That is a lie . He 's done it to himself . - Waldemar , tell him . - Bullshit . It 's true ... - ... He did . - Bullshit . They lured me here . In fact ... You all lured me He used the mouse to infect me . It made it look unintentional . Put the scalpel down . Put the scalpel ... Down . Look at his head . The cut ... - What cut ? - Shit ... Will someone kindly tell me what the hell this is all about ? It 's healed . It works ! It works in humans ! You fucking back off . Alright , I see what 's going on now . I understand your little collaboration , right ? - Geoffrey ... - No , I get it now . You 're in on this , too . What is this infection ? - Is it viral ? - Of course , it 's fucking viral . The easter gene is endogenous retrovirus . Even though these two geniuses couldn 't work it out . This is true . What the hell have you done ? What I have done ? I have just made the discovery of the century ! This is what I have done ! Me , jarek novak ! Remember it . Happy easter . Discovery is not a cure , right ? That 's what you told me . If the healing has accelerated ... So has the tumorigenesis . What do you think I got ? A day ? Maybe two ? Is this contagious ? Ah , it 's alright , Samuel Pretty goddamn sure that it 's blood-borne . No ! Nooo ! No , please ! Stop , let me help him ! Please ! Please , let me help ! No , please ! Please ! Please ! Geoff ! Geoff ! Please ... Oh , please ! Let me go ! Please , please let me go , please ! Please ! Geoff ... Geoff ! Geoff . Geoff , please stop . Stop , please . Geoff . Stop ! There 's nothing you can do . Come back with me . It 's your only chance . No . I 'm going home . Listen , I ... I made a few ... Changes in the sequence , but , it 's ... It 's basically the same . - Same ? - Yeah . The same as what ? Burton 's syndrome . What ? I ... I requested tissue samples When I heard about your son 's condition . My son ? Why ? Why would you do that ? I ... I thought I ... Could help you , somehow . I ... I don 't ... You know , when I started cloning the gene , I ... I discovered it could regenerate Dying cells . I mean ... The tumors are actually the symptom Of cell regeneration . It 's regeneration , out of control . That 's what happened to your son . I wanted you here to share it ... To show it to you , to ... Make you part of it . I mean , you were a part of it . I wanted to tell you , I just ... I was waiting for the right time . What took you so long , huh ? I was afraid to tell you . I didn 't know ... How you 'd react , or ... I 'm sorry , I ... I went too far with it ... - Why ? Why ? ! - Because ... Because I love you , geoff ! Don 't you see that ? I love you ! You love me ? I am so sorry , I ... - No , it 's fine . - ... I never meant ... For this to happen , I ... I have my own disease . You know how funny that is ? I have my own disease . It was just research ... To help you . Research ... That 's exactly what I would say to sarah . Geoff . Geoff ! Geoff ! Geoff , where are you going ? ! Geoff ! Hey ! Hey ... Hey ! Oh ... Okay ... Ticket ? Ticket ? Speak english . Do you speak english ? Hey , hey , hey ... Halt ! Please , stop ! Hi , it 's sarah . I am not available at the moment . Please leave a message after the beep . Thank you . I 'm sorry . And it was just so hard ... I really did ... Why ... ? Where is she ? - Yeah ? - Where is she ? Geoffrey ... You 're awake . Well , at least you got your own room . No ... No , no . Don 't do that . You 've been very ... Restless , these past few days . But don 't you worry . Everything is being thoroughly investigated . Geoffrey ... You have been very ill . But , you 're all better now . Your recovery has been remarkable ... Inspirational , in fact . Do you remember anything ? Where is she ? She 's right here . Look ... No ... Sarah ... Listen , old chap ... We 're gonna have to keep you in here , for a bit . You 're unique , you see ... But just for the moment , you 're a bit of a danger to yourself . Now , don 't worry ... You 'll be alright . Hey , you . You were really sick ... But you 're good now . You 're immune . Look at this . Do you see that ? Jarek was right . Burton syndrome is actually a dormant retrovirus . We all have it . It 's millions of years old . Only that your son had a very special version of it ... Now you . You 're a miracle . And your son was a miracle . Why didn 't your son recover ? How was I supposed to know ?

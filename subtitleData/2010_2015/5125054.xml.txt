 Visual , we 've got our second bandit incoming . Straight ahead . We 're locked on ! Firing ! Where 's that third Raider ? Visual , 3 o 'clock . Fire ! What 's going on ? - We 're fracked up ! - What happened ? It 's all good , we 're all right . Tow bandits , no missiles . Now I really don 't like the math . - Where the frak are you going ? - Can 't stay out in open space . I though we couldn 't outrun them ? - We can 't . - Maybe I can slow them down . - The frakked thing is jammed ! - Let 's go to plan B ! There 's a plan B ? The fuselage is still largely intact , the jump drive will be too . What the hell are you talking about ? We 're gonna thread the needle . Let 's see if the Toasters can file on . One , two , three ... Husker ? Are you counting ? One , two ... - One , two , three ... - Don 't try it ! No ! Husker , no ! You 're not gonna make it ! This is what we do ! Not bad , Husker .

Your orders are to do as I say so long as I 'm aboard this ship They are . It 's all right , they are . Send the message . Sure ... Let 's just let every Toaster ship in the sector know exactly where we are . Clever , I like it . What the frak ? We got a response already ? It 's like someone was camped out on that frequency . Someone was . What 's the message ? They 're coordinates . And these are in Cylon space . - Then that 's where we 're going . - No , it 's not where we 're going . - Yes it is . - No , it 's not where we 're going . I 'm going home .

With your permission , allow me to invite .. .. my sweetheart , the love of my life .. .. who 's here to handout the very.first copy of our book .. .. except of course for the 10000 free copies .. .. we 've already given awayto reviewers .

Yes sir Send a request to bunk at the next port . OK Captain . Superintendent has called again for the reports . He said we will just have to manage it until we 're able to dry.-dock. Did he really ? Well , tell him to shut his mouth and moving to repair this ship .. .. instead of sending out orders from that cozy little office of his . Daddy . Whose ship are we going to ? To dad 's old friend 's ship . And where are we going to ? Well , far far away , to your dad 's place . You want to see my home , son ? Yes , Who is there in your home ? Your grandpa 's there . But Mommy told me that Grandpa went to heaven ! You 've got another grandpa . Oh ! Two grandpas ? Will mummy also come there ? No . Look there 8 long years ! No , 8 short years , mate . Where have you been ? No emails , no phonecalls , nothing ! We knewthat you 'd immigrate somewhere proper but we 'd no idea where . A long story . , mate . Sam . Say hello . Hello . My name is Sam and this is my Octopian boy . An Octopian boywow ! Sam , my name is Freddie and this is my Octopian girl . He 's just being silly . I 'm Razia . Come let 's go . Sam , here . What 's wrong ? - It 's time for Sam 's next dose . He 's got diabetes . Diabetes . It 's for old people . My son 's got it a bit early . Juvenile diabetes . Sam , your hand . Watch it . It 's paining . So Sam is really not Mira 's son . Yeah . Apparently , he lost her . She married some yatchsman . Where is she ? He really didn 't want to talk about it but I knowthat he hasn 't been home in years . Can 't believe it . Here , have some coffee . Darling , you make incredible coffee . Some of the best . But I told Vinaythat we 'll be going to the Seaman 's club tonight and have some drinks . Sam .. - I 'll take care of him . " l walk awayfrom the blue light . " Freddie , memories are like wine , man . Tastes better with time . You 're absolutely right , Vinay . But bad memories get bitter with time . Freddie man , memories come and go , we don 't have a choice . You do remember your first love . First love ? I remember myfirst drink . " Oh its raining " " Somewhere in my dreams " " But I feel the heat " " Shower me with love " " Get your body move " " ln the latest groove " " And make your move " " For the party sake , get your body shake " " Well that 's what ma music will make " " l will love you like a never ending dream Look into my eyes " " Tell me what you see , read my heart Lets party up tonight " " Come on , come on .. Lets turn it up And feel the beat in our hearts " " Come on , come on .. Lets burn it out And swayto the songs tonight " " Move your bodythrough the night " " Lift your hands up for this song " " Dance around and Rock this floortonight " " Get your bodymove " Memories are likewine . Freddy , you tell me , what 's more painful .. .. unexpressed love or unrequitted love ? Ifyou 'd expressed it on time .. .. you 'd would have gotten your love . But it 's too late . It 's time to board . I gotta go ! Vinay . The surveyor has boarded , will you make sure everything 's alright ? I 'll have a quick round . - I 'll take Sam . Sam , don 't trouble Razia . Okay ? Ifthis ship sinks , we can escape in these lifeboats . And what ifthe lifeboat sinks ? Good question . Well lifeboat rarely sink . And even ifthey do , you 've your life jacket to keep you afloat . But what ifthe life jacket sinks ? Ajit ! Ajit ! Don 't fire the boiler , oil has accumulated on the floor ? Clean that out first . I will ! Daddy ! Daddy . Your daddy is busy , we 'll go ? Okay . Hey darling , can you please come down to CCR ? I think I 've a job for you . Ok , I 'll be right there . Don 't worry . , give me an hour I 'll finish the calculations . But filling those tanks partially is dangerous . It 's better to fill the double-bottom tanks instead . But you 've some problems with your transfer lines . Crap ! Is there anything ? Anything at all that works fine on this 200 year old rust bucket . You 2 carry. on , we 'll see what 's going on . This is 9 victa echo echo . There 's a fire onboard . Over . We 'll have to release the CO2 , there 's no other option . - Damn it ! Close the other doors . CO2 released . Over . Myfirst CO2 release experience . Yeah , me too . Crap , I 've gotta give Sam a shot . The fire must 've broken through that .. Have you seen Sam ? Sam is sleeping in my room . He 's not there . - What ? ! He must be somewhere around . I 've looked around , he 's not there . Excuse me , have you seen Sam ? - No Vinay ! Vinay ! Over ! Roger , Vinay here . Over . - Is Sam with you ? No , over . - Then I think you 'd rather bolt . Have you seen Sam ? - No , I 've not seen him . Sam was in the engine room . - What ? He came down searching for you . No , Vinay , you can 't go down without the oxygen mask . Go check the bridge . Check the bridge , quick ! Go to the battery. room and see there .. Nothing ? Nothing ! Go forward ! Forward ! Both ofyou .. both ofyou go to the pump room and look for Sam now ! Wait ! Wait ! Take him to the cabin . Vinay ! We found him ! Sam ! Sam ! I fell asleep . I 'm so sorry . , Vinay . - It 's alright . Man , you 've tried all the available options ? Almost . There 's one last thing left . One last hope . What 's bothering you ? Sam 's alright . I 'm just thinking about Vinay and Mira . I hate tragic love stories . Well then , what kind of love stories do you love ? Our kind . Really ? - Yes . Why is that ? Doesn 't the sea look romantic ? It 's beautiful . But is not really half as beautiful as you look right now . I love you . - Oh lady ! Let 's not get too carried awaywith this . C 'mon , let 's go to bed . Carry me , my captain , I 'm tired . ok .. " Everyday in my life Seems like I met my knight " " ln shining armor you Came for me in light " 'There is no one anywhere in the world Whom I can trust for sure " 'To hold my hands all the way My life lies ahead of me " " Blinding lights all around But I don 't hear a sound " " Your voice is in my head And my heart is filled with song " I was thinking how it 'd feel .. .. to have someone lying between us . Someone we could call our own . Am I so boring ? That you need somebody here with us ? Besides with somebody between us , how can I hold you so closely ? Things like the repairs will last for months . It 'd be easier to just replace the whole engine room . It 's hard to get spares for a girl that old . Freddy , I need to take some time off to go home . I don 't want to delay Sam 's treatment . Of course , are you sure you 'll be going to the right place ? Like I said , my last hope . Well good . It 's a weekend anyway . Bye . HeyVinay ! Next week , summer palace alright ? Daddy , what is that thing for ? That separates the seawater from the fresh water . Where 's the dam ? It 's veryfar off . Beyond our home . " Why did you go leaving me ? " 'Why did you so break my heart ? " 'Where can I find you now ? " " Where you are ? " " No matter where you are ... " " my heart too will be there " " Will we ever meet again ? " 'Will my lost love come back ? " " Why did you go leaving me ? " 'Why did you so break my heart ? " " You had given me only one gift ... That was just your memories " " You had given me only one memory ... . That was just your love " " That love was always the symbol In the poems from my heart " " Even the winds heard ... what I told the clouds " " Can you ... Not hear it ... The agony of my love " " Why did you go leaving me ? " 'Why did you so break my heart ? " Sir , this is your stop . Are you not getting down ? Dad .. Sleeping . Shall I wake him up ? - No . He was talking about your arrival today . Mira .. Nothing , forget it . Take a bath . I 'll get the dinner ready . What 's your son 's name ? Sam ... Samuel . Your husband .. Oh ! You didn 't dry. your hair ? Daddy , wake up . Wake up , daddy ! Who are you ? First tell me , who are you ? I 'm asking you , who are you ? But who are you ? Blow . Blow ! Son . I knew you 'd come back . But I thought you 'd come much earlier . See , your horoscope prediction says that your wandering period is now over . I know , you don 't believe in all this . Buddha 's teachings have changed me a lot , son . Where 's that boy ? Come here . Let me see . Blow . I 'm happythat my son has come home with his son . I remember you curing a case of juvenile diabetes .. Diabetic . Someone will be coming from the East . Maybe snake bite . Be prepared . Sire ! Sire ! He 's been poisoned ! A viper . Scared ? Your tea must be cold . Let me get you another . Did father teach you astrologytoo ? I can 't even predict my own future . That is dangerous ! You do that , when there is no other option ! All these injections and these tablets .. .. he 's such a small child . All these doctor 's theyjust prescribe medicines . God . He cures illiness . I am sorry . , If I could never fulfill your deams or followyour foot steps . He decides so . We can not change our destiny ! How long are you going to be here ? For a few months perhaps ! You actuallywant to leave ? I haven 't decided yet ! And Sam 's mother ? She wasn 't able to come . Show me your tongue . It will take some times treatment . Let him be here . This is his home . No ? Ok ! Welcome to the summer palace ! This is amazing ! Come on Freak man ! Marvelous ! This house has exceeds all my expectations . After father 's death , we are the onlytwo actually staying here . Come on , come this way ! I want to showyou something . My great grand father ! He came here to India to build this dam , dumb American settled here . It was my misfortune .. .. I am not destined to be some British born to a rich woman in Europe . We still have time Freddie ! Meet my Grand father.Sir William Brown .. He was the first to admire this place . His game was cricket not politics . Myfather , John Brown . Myfather is the man , who made the city the wayyou see it now . He started the construction on the dam but before he finished it , he was killed . He is probably constructing a dam in heaven now ! This is my sister , Mariya Brown . She was the only worry. in my life . Awrongfully administered anesthesia did that to her . Frederick Brown didn 't inherit political powers from his father . This man Durai , Mariya 's husband . He became the next mayor I wish I could talk to her for now . Sir . What is this , sir ? Leave him Enjoying your parole ? Yes sir . You didn 't get much ofthis in jail , didn 't you ? No sir . I told you , you 'll receive a wam reception ! Bythe dam protestor 's your now a hero ! When they requested , I couldn 't say no .. - How 's your family ? Fine sir ! Brother ! Did you come out on parole to spend time with your family or make speeches . Sir ? You were not suppose to make speeches against the dam . I 'm sorry. sir ! You will not speak against the dam anymore ! I am sorry. sir ! Dirty dog ! I thought he would get away by killing his boss . Throw him into the bushes . You 're always a witness . No wonder why . I believe your brother is in town ! I was wondering whether .. .. I should send him also to the bushes . Please let me go ! I want to see him . No . - Please Ifyou will go away , who will keep my secrets ? Whoa easy easy What ifyou do not return ? Howwill I win my next election with out you ? I need you . You are my lucky mascot ! Just like him . How long will it take for the divorce ? There are some formalities to take care of . What is Sandra doing now ? Which he always does , shooting new stories . Ifyour father was so worried about Mira 's horoscope .. .. howwas he able to accept her marring a foreigner ? How can you absolutely know nothing about ? I still dont believe this story .. Father , this is .. I know . This is Raziya . And this is Freddy . Your friends from the Marine Institute . Vinaytold us that you knowthe past , present and future . Now I 'm convinced . No , Vinay has told me so much about you . Love birds who crossed the border to nest ! I am a bit curious . Is it possible to know our future ? Astrological progressions can only give you an insight to opportunities and .. .. trends from the cosmic angle . Tell me your date , place and time of birth . We shall see . Because I understand that Indian astrology is based on the 9 planets . But Pluto 's no more planet . This is also based on some misunderstanding ! According to the nine star 's , only five planets are included from the solar system . So actually it is onlythe Sun and the Moon that has the maximum influence on our daily life . Much more than other bodies and planets ! You believe that destiny cannot be changed ! Sometimes the vibrations from the hymns of the veda .. They can have some effect . That is why we have the prayers . Where is Mira ? Mira ! See who 's here ? Come ! Hi Mira ! Vinay always talked about you ! Mira did this , Mira did that , never spoke of another woman . He lived with your memories Mira , for years . Each and every. second of it . Ever since , why did you ditch him . Yes , I ditched , not him , but my dreams Do you anything about me ? Do you know anything about my love ? Nothing Have you ever experienced the pain while sacrificing your love ? But I did . I have never lived for myself . It 's all myfaith ! I dont understand ! Come . This is all he left for me . I dont knowwhen I started loving him . Happy birthday ! Thank you . Father read my horoscope and discovered that marriage would hold nothing ! But tragedy and sorrowfor me . He performed many rituals and prayers to try. cleanse me ofthis curse . Vinay believed in none of it .. " Why did you leave me and go ? " " Why did you break my heart and go away ? " " Where are you now ? " " Where are you ? " 'Wherever you will be .. " " .. there shall be .. " I was all alone after Vinay left for his studies " Will we ever meet again ? " " Will my lost love return to me ? " Father realized how we felt about each other . He checked the compatiability of our horoscopes . He was shocked to learn that we weren 't destined to be together even for a day . He studied every. old manuscript he could find a solution . He was not able to accept a positive disaster . I 'm only saying what I 'm seeing . He revealed everything to me . In the beginning I could not accept it as myfate . But I knew he was never wrong in his prediction . Whenever we tried to express our love it was followed by a tragedy . I engrossed myself in learning treatment from father and devoted more time to practice it . Then one day .. Mark came to treat his psoriasis . His wife had left him because of his skin condition . Mark grew closer to me . Finally he asked me to marry. him . Father was suprised to see the compatiability of Mark 's horoscope with mine . He believed that the rituals and prayers have brought me this luck of one in a million chance . For me it was an exit from everything . And I said yes to Mark 's proposal . But I didn 't know howto face Vinay ! How dare you invite me to your wedding ? Dont you know I love you ? You never told me . All my life you lived with me and you didn 't know ? You didn 't really mean it . I have made up my mind . You made this for me . " You have given me just one gift . " 'That is only .. " 'That is onlyyour memory .. " Mark was understood everything and left very. quietly . Accepting myfate , I took a break from my professional study . You could have told me everything ! I am sorry. this misunderstanding has been very. painful . You know there are two sides of a coin . So close yet never knowning each other . You never told me what happened with you . I tried to forget . And you blame me for not telling you everything . You 're right . I am sorry ! I met Sandra on my first voyage . She was the daughter of my captain . It was just the beginning . She is beautiful . We were like needles in a clock . You know difference of breed , different purposes . Meeting at different times . I dont even know why we even got married . I didn 't want Sam to grow up in an atmosphere like this . Dont worry everything will be alright ! There is hope . You will soon have a child . I can see it . Do you have any faith in Ayurveda ? I 've never tried it but I have faith in you . Ayurveda means knowledge of life . It 's a 5000 years old wisdom . Nature 's old cures and treatments . Unfortunately , not many people practice it as it should be . I will give you some medicine which you must take regularly without fail . Have faith and put that faith into practice . Sam , come . Sam , don 't be a bad boy ! First let me finish your treatment for today . No Mira . I want to play now . Ifyou be a good boy and listen to me , I will take you to see the damn later . Really ? - Really , ok ? Ok - Good boy Dad , come fast . I don 't feel lonely right now . But .. - But ? After you leave , I don 't know . Sam is my onlyworry now . Because he needs his mother soon . No one would be a better mother to Sam than you . Ifyou say yes , I dont have to go back . Am I so lucky ? Our horoscopes could not have changed over night ! Our stars are still jealous of us . I am sorry . I am not questioning your beliefs . But what could be worse than this ? Death ? It 's better to die than live like this . But father ? I once failed with him and you . I can 't fail again . Do you remember this damn ? I think it is also like us . Holding pressure but for others . Do you remember those long walks to school ? Yeah , in the rain . That was fun . Aleast it was fun with you . Wow ! It is drizzling ! Mummy ! Hey ! Hey , my little man ! My mummy has come . Hello Vinay ! Hello Mira ! Vinay has spoken a lot about you ! How are you , my boy ? I am good mummy and how are you ? Father .. I 'm .. - Sandra , isn 't it ? I knewyou 'd be coming . Mummy ! Mummy ! Where 's my gift ? Hi ! - Where 's my gift ? - One second .. Right here . - Thank you , mummy . Thank you . You 'll catch a cold , it 's wet . Well , I 've been in many more rains before . I 've always wanted to be here during the monsoon seasons . Doesn 't seem to be raining much right now . See , here the climate is always changing . It 's beautiful here . Excuse me . No microwave radiation . Well actually , I did need to make a call . For that you 've to cross the river . So , you 've come to meet your son ? Yes , I have . I 'm also here doing a documentary . on the last colonial dam . Just started my research . Perhaps I can help you . A book on Navarasas . Where did you find this ? I 've searched so many places for a book like this . You like it then you can have it . Thank you . This no . 9 .. .. you know , is the most meaningful number according to Vedic mathematics . Here also it 's very important and for your dam project also . You see , there 's a water-sharing contract with the neighbouring state for .. .. 999 years and legally it cannot be cancelled . And this fight is going on and on , for decades and decades . So tomorrow , ifthe world war happens , surelythe cause will be water . Anymore divorce papers to sign ? It took me months to track you down . Why can 't you atleast respond to my mails ? I had to find some reason to come back . Why don 't you shoot a programme on diabetic children who grow up without a other 's care ? Look , I don 't want to argue , Vinay . I want my Sam back and you too . Why ? Has your busy schedule finally all cleared up ? I knowwhat I did . I 'm sorry .. Where were you all these years ? But I 'm here now . I came back to get what I threw away . I know I was wrong . And I understand you now . Don 't make the same mistake I made . Think what this divorce would do to my child . Mummy ! - Baby ! Mummy , see , the head is turning . - Wow ! This is so cool . " Even though you reached so close to me " " As close as I could wrap my arms around yo " " ln this lonely and silent home unknown to all " " Like strangers we stood ... Like total strangers , we stood apart " You look great ! This city is drying . There is not a single drop ofwater to drink . Next election is round the corner . Do remember that . People are wondering why so much money has been gone into building the new dam . Are you building a dam of gold ? Don 't make me repeat mywords . I am sick of denying these false allegations . You promised the people a new dam five years ago . And what happened ? Where is the water ? People need water not your election manifesto . You understand one thing . There is no sympathywave this time . Your wife 's maiden name won 't help you win this election . John Brown 's son is back in town . Ifwe can convince him , we can project him as the candidate . Stop this nonsense ! Stop this nonsense . I .. I know that we need water . And I knowthat we 're delayed . But we will get the dam . You 've Durai 's word for it . You have been saying this for the past five years . Meeting is over . These dams , you know , are very dangerous . You know , the largest man-made disaster .. .. is not the nuclear bomb , it 's the dam disaster . And more than 250,000 people .. they lost their lives in that . And now if this dam bursts , then 10 times more will lose their lives . Grandpa , see , Octopian boy can save you from anytrouble . The family doctor can 't believe Sam 's new diagnosis . So now your insurance agent will be very. happy . You must spend more time with your son . I think right now , his grandfather is a better choice . I 've to go to the temple . - Temple ? Sam , your father is not feeling well today . - Why ? He 's going to the temple . You should go back to your family . Sam needs to be with his mother . How can you take your love back just like that ? Just deny everything . Our dreams , our love ? Don 't be cruel . Please . The stars have decided . I don 't have the right to return love to anyone in my life . I 'm used to it by now . Life can be cruel . Sometimes we need to burn out for others . If the flame tries to feel the pain of the wick , it can 't glow . I don 't have anymore dreams for myself . Just let me go back to my old life . I realise nowwhat I was missing . I 'm waiting for your nod . This is going to be my last assignment . Everything depends on you . - I need time to think . I haven 't said yes yet . You said you 'd think about it . That 's enough for now . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the 5th party at our summer palace . This is the last partywe 're holding at this wonderful house . Oh ! - Yes .. yes .. Our marine city will be waiting for you soon . Next year , we 'll partythere . - Yeah ! Yes .. yes .. and there 's one more announcement . 9 months from nowthere 's going to be a new cadet coming aboard the good hip Freddy . Yes .. yes .. thank you .. thank you all very. much . Now let 's enjoythe party . Music please . Freddy . You forgot to invite your only brother-in-law . Razia , congratulations . You know , Maria will be thrilled hearing this news . Ifyou don 't mind I 'll take him away for a few minutes . I didn 't come here to drink or dance . What do you want , Durai ? They 're saying , certain people have spoken to you about running for mayor . If I wanted to enter your bloody game of politics , I 'd have done it a long time ago . And lucky for you I 'd rather be amongst the honest seas than greedy land-hunters like ourself . But you could get ambitious . And .. you 've reasons , don 't you ? You 're awaiting the next drought . You 've already done enough to harm me , Durai . You separated me from my only sister . Durai is not a loser . To win he can separate anything from anybody . I want you to know one thing , Freddy . The rule of your dynasty is over with your father . Don 't try. and do anything stupid to try and regain it . That 's not really enough to frighten a mariner . You know , I was elected on a sympathy wave . I just might get re-elected on another sympathy wave . After the death of my beloved wife . Any doubts ? Nice music going on . Enjoythe party . C 'mon ! Durai said he would kill Maria . I 'll kill that bloody bastard before he touches her again . Did I forget I had a sister and maybe she needed me ? Don 't jump to conclusions , Freddy . First find out what you don 't know . John Brown was more than a mentor to me . John Brown was more than a mentor to me . He was my role model . Guru . Like your god . This new dam was his dream project . But he died a martyr . I 'm just a caretaker . My mission is to complete his vision . Excuse me . Hello . Okay . I 'll do that . Excuse me , I need to go . Can we complete this later ? - It 's ok . I can wait . Ifyou need anything , just ask for it . Excuse me . Maria . - Who are you ? I 'm Sandra , Freddy 's friend . Freddy ! How 's my Freddy ? Where 's he ? - Freddy 's alright . But he 's worried . - Tell him I 'm alive . We knowwhat 's going on here , ok ? Be readytonight , we 'll be back . Be careful . Durai 's dangerous . Don 't worry , leave it to us . Let 's do it , Rambo . You 'll be safe here . Let 's get this mess cleaned up . We 'll be right back . - Thank you . I 'll take you away from here forever . Freddy , I 've to tell you something . - What ? Our father wasn 't murdered . - What do you mean ? He committed suicide . - What ? ! He 's doing it for us . Durai ! Cheat ! How dare you ? This must be scrapped ! Do you know how many people got killed in today 's police firing ? I 'll not let you kill my people again . We found out about you . - To hell with your findings . What ? ! Isn 't this your signature , Mr. Mayor ? Your people , the same people you 're speaking of protecting , will soon spit n you . I beg you , Durai . Please don 't . Tomorrowyou 've till tomorrow to close this or else .. .. I 'll decide what to do next . Is that what you reallywant ? Please don 't do this , Durai . Please , I 'm begging you .. - Shut up . Don 't do this to myfather please .. - Shut up ! I 'll not let you do it . Not while I 'm alive . Why are you crying for me ? Try. crying for your dad . The servant lied to the police . And then again in court , to make it look like a murder . Durai easilywon the election . I think she left the country .. - No way . Her passport is with me . Shall we go to the police ? Is police more capable than Durai ? Comb the entire city . Track all his calls and moves . Make sure this matter doesn 't leak out . Cause if it does . It 'll jeopardise the entire election victory .. Search inside What you want ? Don 't interfere you son of a bitch ! Hey ! Don 't use that kind of language here , Durai . This is not your party office . Go search ! Did you forget something at the party ? I think I did . Relax , You are in safe hands . Boss , she is not here . You checked every.where ? - Yes . Move in Freddy , don 't ever playwith Durai . I know she is in the city . And I will get her . Ayurveda doesn 't work on medicines only . Results really depend on your lifestyle . Dad , I 've some good news for you . Tell me . The inauguration date for the new dam has been fixed . I think I could showthe last sunset now . When is it ? - On the 9th . Another 999 . Oh my god ! Mira ! Mira ! It 's a bad omen . Disaster . Tomorrow , we 'll go live as planned . I 'll send you a mail . Ok , bye . Let 's make a move . - Alright . When do you need to go , son ? Tomorrow . Ifyou must go then go today itself . Tomorrow is not an auspicious day . Bad times , omens , I can 't believe you 're still going on and on about all his . It 's my belief , myfeeling . Something terrible is going to happen . Sam will go away . He must .. .. atleast he should not grow up without his mother . Sam . Hey Sam ! Sam . She has given up all her dreams . I have not been able to give her anything back . Sam , c 'mon . Don 't be a bad boy . Sam ! Sam ! Honey , please take your medicines . My documentary. is going live in the evening . Please do watch it . - I 'll try .. Come back before dinner , it 'd be our last meal together . I 'll surely do my best to make it . I 'm still waiting for an answer , honey . Let 's be optimistic . I 'll see you in the evening . Sam , you 're a healthy boy now . But don 't forget to take your medicines , ok ? - Okay . But Mira , why are you so sad ? When you reach home , will you remember me ? - Yes . Come with us , Mira . - I can 't . Please . - Sam , I can 't come . Grandpa . You 've put all his medicines ? - Yes . - Show . Grandpa , I 'm a healthy boy now . You 're a strong boy . Now , don 't need this . So , we 'll remove it . Throw it . " Salutations , O motherland ! " " Salutations , O motherland ! " " Salutations , O motherland ! " This urban dam has completed 100 years of existence . This is the last sunset for this colonial dam . It 'd witnessed an empire on which the sun never used to set . It has witnessed its decline . Tomorrow it becomes just an underwater monument . A reminder of the long gone colonial era as dam 999 . Pack up . - Ok . Great Job guys - thanks . Thank you , ma 'am . - Welcome What happened ? Hope it 's not the calm before the storm . Yes , looks like a heavy rain is building up . Let 's go to the new dam . We need to plan for tomorrow 's coverage . It 's time to say goodbye . I was so lonely . I just couldn 't stop thinking of you . Its fate . Well , I don 't believe in that crap anymore . We 've a chance . Vinay , it 's for you . I could never take a chance with your life . My faith won 't let me . I was always afraid to come to this house . For me this place has never been complete without you . You 're always with me . Close to me , in my heart . I told you , it 's my fate . No , our fate . I can 't leave you to fate anymore . Come , let 's go inside . It 's going to rain now . - No grandpa , it 's not raining . C 'mon .. c 'mon .. Where 's your dad ? - Inside . Really ? - Yeah . Can I have that ? It 's a miracle ! I can 't believe it . - You should thank Mira for this . All I did was obey her . Thank you so much , Mira . Thank you . Thank you . See this sis , passport and the cds . Welcome to the world of menace . Sir , thank you for your support . - You 're welcome . Oh damn it ! I 'm late . And all this rain .. - What do you expect ? It 's been burning for the past few days in the mountains . The heaviest rainfall ever been recorded . See , there 's a low pressure formation moving from East towards us . What 's going on ? What ? ! Oh my god ! Damn it ! Stop filling the dam . - What ? ! You heard it . Stop fillind the dam and open the bi-valve shutter . But we need special permission for that . - Then get it . Sir , what about the inauguration ? Opening the shutter would flood the axis road . Inauguration ? The whole place will be under water and you 're talking about he inauguration ? We 'll have to call the mayor , sir . - I said get him on the line right now . I said right now . Sir , you know he won 't give us permission . This dam won 't take anyone 's permission to collapse . There 's another way out . - What ? We can close the old dam 's shutters partially . - No way . Water level at the dam has already reached the maximum level . Ifwe try. to pull back anymore water , that 's the end . Oh my god ! The altitude of this place is around 3000 feet . If it breaks , the water will rush like a bullet and sweep the city in her loods . Let me talk to the mayor . Please try.to understand the situation , sir . The dam is not even tested once . - What ? You 're scared of a little hole . Go and check out the old dam , it has a lot of them . And it has lasted more than 100 years . But this is a concrete dam , it won 't sustain . We 'd decided we shall not fill it to capacity right ? Let 's get on with the inauguration and .. .. later we shall test it or fix it .. whatever . Are you crazy ? Don 't talk like an idiot . Shut up ! You got your share , right ? Right ? If anyone else comes to know about it .. .. do I need to tell you what will happen ? If the dam collapses , 2.5 million people will be washed away . Just follow my orders . Follow my orders ! The inauguration is going to happen tomorrow . The press will be there , the dignitaries will be there . And so will you be . I want you there in time . Thank you . - Hello .. hello .. stupid . Ifthis dam bursts , 10 times more people will lose their lives . Oh crap ! The lines are down . In the present inflow rate , how long will it take for the dam to collapse ? 4-5 hours . We 've enough time to move our families to safer places . Let 's go . Come . Sir . Sir , aren 't you leaving ? - Just get out of this place . Don 't be stupid . - Let me see what I can do . Sir , we 've to save this place . We 've to do it . Hey man ! Think about your family . No , sir . I won 't go . And you , get your crew and get out of here . You can cover a big disaster . Excuse me , but what makes you so sure that this dam will burst ? The way it was constructed . It 's my design . I was bribed bythat bloody Durai . But when I realised the danger , I informed the mayor . But before he could do something , he was killed on the same day . You said there 's something left to do . - What 's left ? This dead phone ? I 've a satellite phone in the van . Inform the higher authorities . Also we have up linking facility . Lets alert the media , we still have time . But who 's going to take this small leak seriously ? No one . Relax . It 's not too late . Let 's break the rules . - Ok , come . If we can open the bypass shutter , we 've a chance . Why don 't you open the shutters of this new dam ? But water will take a few more hours to reach the shutter level . Lets open the bypass shutter . Before we open the shutter we need to give a lood alert to the public . You leave that to me . The main power is out . You try.to reach the alert . Show on the way . - C 'mon ! Hurry. up ! Hurry. up ! Damn it . He 's acting fast . The police doesn 't want the news to leak out . Let 's go . We need a vehicle . - Ok . We need to get out of here right now . The new dam is going to burst and it 's already started leaking . What do you mean ? - lt 'll stayfor a few more hours . Anything can happen after that . - You mean the whole place will be flooded ? Exactly . Everything is captured in this . We need to playthis video at the local cable TV station . If Maria talks , people will believe . Well let 's go then , we need to reach the sea to make all this happen . But before we do that , we need to move every.one here to a safer place . The church on the hilltop is the only option right now . We 've to move How many boats do we have ? - Two . A speedboat and a houseboat . Listen , Razia and Mira can take dad , Sam and the other patients in the boat . Let Freddytake Maria into the ship . Vinay , go with Freddy , reach the cable TV station . Try. to convince them . Try.for repeat runs . I 've to get back to the dam site . You didn 't give me a reply . I guess I was a little late getting here . Don 't worry. about me . For me there will always be another assignment waiting . Be careful . - You too . Go with Razia and Mira . I 'll come back soon . Ok ? Take care . C 'mon guys , let 's move . Take care ofyourself and junior , alright ? I 've to go . It 's time to go . - Ok . - I 'll carry.you alright ? - Yeah . Call father ! Meera , let 's not waste time . Call him .

There 's a leak in the dam and the dam will burst in a matter of hours . The lives of thousands are under threat . I request you to leave to high altitudes immediately . C 'mon fast .. Stop it ! - Hey ! Hey ! Stop it ! Stop it ! Who asked you to telecast this ? Where is he ? - He 's in the editing suite . Where ? - Upstairs . Get him . - Ok , sir . Where is his place ? It 's near the dam . He himselfwill show us . All failed . - What do you mean ? This whole place is flooding . - So what ? We don 't have a neumatic system to open the bypass shutters . Yeah . We should go for that . But the opening valve is under water . Can we give it a try ? - Yes , we should . But it 's too risky . - No , sir . Ifwe have an option , we should try .. - Ok . Look here , this is the shutter drive . This is the first valve , this is the other valve . All valves are to be simultaneously opened to get sufficient pressure . Ok , sir . Take care of the shutter . At exactly five minutes , we 'll open the valve . C 'mon , Sandra . Daddy ! Where 's dad and Mira ? Where are they ? They didn 't come . - What ? ! Father refused to come and Mira .. she couldn 't leave without him . Oh no ! We should turn all the valves . Just turn it this way . I 'll showyou the other one . - Ok . Oh shit ! It 's totallyflooded . You open the first valve , I 'll take care of the other . We only have 3 minutes . - Good luck Earthquake ! Careful . Come fast . Oh god ! Sir ! Sir ! Sir ! An earthquake of 6.5 magnitude was recorded on the Richter scale .. .. causing the over-filled century. old dam to burst . In just half an hour , the entire citywas washed away . No more dams exist in this place . It took 15 years for the world to come to know about the 1975 dam disaster in China , .. .. where hundreds of thousands of lives got perished . The series of dam disasters doesn 't stop here . With over 4000 similar outdated dams across the world .. .. potential threat to life remains unanswered . Do we stop this or should we just wait for another disaster to happen . This is the world 's biggest disaster ever . Is it the anger of Mother Nature ? Or the wrong doings of human beings ? Scared of a little hole . Go and check out the old dam . It has a lot ofthem and it has lasted more than 100 years . Much longer than you and I will live . Can you try ? Ok . I 'll do my best . - Good . Charles , this is Sandra . Good evening , lovelyto meet you . And Vinay . - Hi , Vinay . And this little man is Sam . Hi , Sam . - Hi ! Please excuse me . Vinay . - I thought I saw Mira . No , Vinay . Vinay , look .. Vinay ! Stop ! Please ! Mira ! - Vinay , please stop ! Mira ! Vinay ! It 's your imagination . I saw her . I saw her . I saw her . Alright you two we have another function to attend . So see you later this evening . Alright ? See you later Sam ! Freddy , you think we made a mistake with the ending of the story ? What do you mean ? I think Mira 's alive out there somewhere . Well , the novel 's already published but there 's always room for a sequel . C 'mon . There 's life even after death . It 's in the memory .. That Mira lives in Vinay 's memories .

 Previously on The 100 ... Bellamy , don 't do this ! - He deserves to die ! - No ! We don 't decide who lives and dies ! The Exodus ship is still tied in to all our major systems ! If it launches , the Ark will be crippled - and everyone left onboard will die ! - Launch ! You started a war that you don 't know how to end . You have no idea what your people have done . - We had to stop the attack . - You stopped nothing . Clarke , come on ! Clarke ! - Take him away , and kill him . - No ! No ! No ! No ! Every simulation has been run . Every system modification has been made . The hard and simple fact is that in 51 hours , life on the Ark will no longer be possible . I choose to find consolation in one remarkable truth . The surviving members of the hundred have proven themselves to be more resilient than we could have ever imagined . Our legacy will go on . And for that I am not only grateful but I am proud . So what do we tell our constituents to do now ? What do we do now ? Look inside . Find your peace . In the meantime , I 'm releasing all available resources to the surviving citizens of the Ark . There will be no more rationing . What we have belongs to all of us . - Are you all right , Abby ? - Yes . I have a patient , she was ... hurt in the bomb blast . I need to go . Sir , is it wise to waste rations when we don 't know for sure ? But we do know for sure . I can 't just do nothing . - I need to find a solution . - Wait . I know this is hard to accept . But if you 'd like to spend your remaining time re-running simulations , by all means , you can do that . I , however , will be spending my time with family and a bottle of 97-year-old scotch . Come on . These foxholes aren 't gonna build themselves . Better hope those landmines work . All the gunpowder we 're wasting , we could be making more grenades . You wanna come over here and test one ? Cute . I need this entire section mined by morning . - Then we 'll finish the south field . - Hey ! I told you , we 're going after Finn , Clarke and Monty in the morning . And I told you , nobody leaves this camp . I 'm talking to you ! We can 't just abandon our people ! You wanna lead them , show them you give a damn . - What the hell was that ? - What are you shooting at ? - Hey ! - I can 't see anything ! What the hell 's the matter with you ? I 'm sorry , man , I fell asleep . I 've been on watch all day . We 've all been on watch all day ! That bullet was one less dead Grounder . - Bell , you 're scaring people . - They should be scared ! The bomb on the bridge bought us some time to prepare ! But that time is up ! The Grounders are out there right now , waiting for us to leave and picking us off one by one when we do ! Clarke , Finn and Monty are gone . Probably dead . And if you wanna be next , I can 't stop you ! But no guns are leaving this camp ! This camp is the only thing keeping us alive ! Get back to work ! Your left flank is vulnerable . My archers are in the trees with orders to kill anyone hostile . You 're not hostile , are you , Tristan ? So this is who 's beating you ? Who are you ? I 'm the man sent to slaughter your people . The commander sent you ? Your unit is mine now . My rangers are hungry . They 're at the river . Go feed them ! We march on the invaders ' camp at first light . I 'll make quick work of what you failed to do . Starting with this one . - Over there . - A signal fire ! Reapers . - Let them know we see it . - Quickly ! I 'll send my fastest rider to warn the commander . No , there 's no time . Kill the prisoner , get to the river . Is the boy dead ? - Good . - Finn ! Kill the girl , then catch up . Don 't you think I wanna go after them , too ? If it was you out there , you think Monty , Clarke or Finn would hide behind these walls ? No . They 'd go after me , and they 'd be dead , too . I am doing what I think is right for the group . It 's funny you didn 't think that way when Octavia went missing . - Where are you going ? - More gunpowder for your minefield , sir . Water ! Please ! I 'll get you some . Water ... This is for tying the noose that they hung me with . Say hi to Connor for me . He stopped breathing , and I was ... I was trying to help him . Murphy , put the gun down . He tried to kill me . - Don 't move ! - Okay . Okay . It 's cool . No , it 's not . You know what will happen to me if you tell Bellamy . Tell Bellamy what ? Give me the radio , Jasper . - Murphy has a gun . He killed ... - Shut up ! Murphy , what the hell are you doing ? Murphy ! Murphy ! Open the damn door ! You try to be a hero , Jasper dies ! Finn ? Oh , my God ! I don 't understand how ... Lincoln saved my life . He killed one of his own people to do it . The signal fire ? That was you ? We needed a distraction . I 'd say it worked . - Not well enough . - What 's it mean ? It means Anya knows Clarke 's not dead . We need to hurry . Let 's hope they follow the horse . - Hey , what do we do now ? - Now , we run ! Come on ! It 's right up here ! - What is ? - Some place they won 't follow . - Wait . Where does it lead ? - Everywhere . There 's a tunnel near your camp . If we make it through , we should get there before Tristan . Go . Go ! Lincoln ! Anya , no ! We know where they 're going . If the mine doesn 't kill them first . Come on ! Abby , BP 's dropping down to 96 over 55 . We never should have opened her back up . - It was the only way to save her . - Save her for what ? She 'll be dead in two days . We all will ! She 's crashing ! Another amp of epi . Starting CPR . Come on . - We can 't give her any more epi ... - Rationing is over . - Now , get me the damn epinephrine ! - There is no more epinephrine ! We 're all out ! Come on ! Come on , breathe ! You have to let her go . I failed . I failed . You did the best that you could . You always do . She 's gonna hate me forever . She blames me for her father 's death . I 'll never get to make that right now . Never get to hug her . Can 't protect her anymore . Clarke doesn 't hate you , Abby . She 's just ... She 's just strong-willed . Like her mom . You gave her that . That 's how you 're protecting her . And that 's what will keep her alive on the ground . Thank you , Jackson . Get out of here . Go on . Look out ! I just heard Murphy has Jasper . Yeah . South foxhole done ? What ? Bellamy , my friend 's in there with a killer . Look around . No one 's working . If the Grounders attack us right now , we 're all dead . Murphy , if you even touch Jasper , I swear to God , - you 're dead ! - Octavia , I got this ! Really ? ' Cause it doesn 't look like you 're doing anything about it . Bellamy . You were right . There 's a loose panel on the back . If I can pop it , we can get in through the floor . Good . Do it . Sorry . Murphy , I know you can hear me . All our ammo and food is in the middle level . You know that . You 're leaving us vulnerable to an attack . I can 't let that happen . Well , in case you haven 't noticed , you 're not exactly in control right now . Come on , Murphy . You don 't wanna hurt Jasper . You wanna hurt me . So what do you say ? How about you trade him for me ? - No ! - All you have to do is let him go and I 'll take his place . - How ? - Bellamy ! If you do this , he 'll kill you . If I don 't , he 'll kill Jasper . Simple . You open the door , I walk in , he walks out . - Just you , Bellamy ! Unarmed ! - Take this . Ten seconds , or I 'll put one in Jasper 's leg ! - One . - Raven will find a way - to get you out . - I can handle Murphy . Get everyone back to work . Grounders are still coming . - Four ! Five ! - I 'm here ! Jasper . Are you okay ? You were right . They didn 't follow us . Reapers use these tunnels . Tristan wouldn 't risk running into them . What the hell 's a reaper ? Pray you never find out . We have to keep moving . Lincoln ! You 're hit ! Hey , let me look at that . I 've fought battles with worse wounds than this . We 're not in a battle right now . Yes we are . Why are you helping us ? This can 't just be about Octavia . Fine , don 't tell us . Give me your knife . Heat the blade . You might want something to bite down on . You people are so soft . If you don 't learn to be more ... What my people are doing to yours is wrong . - Very cool . - Stop thinking like a mechanic . - Find me something to shoot through . - This mechanic is - gonna hotwire the door . - There 's the hatch . Locks are above . Forget it . Damn it ! - He 's up there because of me ! - Shh ! Help me find a door circuit . We lost Clarke . - We can 't lose Bellamy , too . - Jasper , shut up ! They are , like , right above your head . Good . I 'll just shoot through the floor . I just need to figure out where Murphy is . Bad idea . Holy crap ! There 's tons of it . The engine 's firing blade on the way down . - We can make more bombs . - Yeah . Put that on our to-do list . From now on , no shooting . You got me ? That 's good . Then do what I said . Bellamy ? Bellamy , are you okay ? You want her to know you 're alive ? Start tying . Bellamy , do you copy ? I 'm fine . Just a misfire . Stop worrying about me and get back to work . All of you . And tell Raven to hurry her ass up . All right , that 's long enough . Tie those two ends together . Get that door open . All right . Now , get up and toss it over . What do you want me to say ? You want me to apologize ? I 'm ... I 'm sorry . You got it all wrong , Bellamy . I don 't want you to say anything . I want you to feel what I felt , and then ... Then I want you to die . What are you two doing over there ? Come on . Let 's rehearse for the unity pageant . - The stations ... - The other stations . The other stations saw this , and wanted to be together , too . - That 's very good . - When all the stations were joined , - they called themselves the Ark . - Good job , Wells . Daddy , how did the Ark stay in space ? Good question . By keeping out of the Earth 's gravitational pull . My daddy says it 's the thrusters . Well , your daddy 's right , Clarke . There are thrusters all over the Ark . Every station has them . They keep us spinning so that we generate our own gravity . They help us stay in orbit and they help us steer . Yes . Yes . If you 've never been down here , how 'd you map it ? Spoils of war . What is that ? Reapers . Stand on it . Put it over your head . This is insane . The Grounders could ... No ! - We need to do this now . - I 'm working as fast as I can . The wires for the door are mixed in with the ignition system . Sparking the wrong one would be bad . Put it over your head . Happy now ? You 're so brave , aren 't you ? You came in here thinking you were just gonna turn this thing around , that you were stronger than me , that maybe one of your friends would come and help you ? Well , what are you thinking now , Bellamy ? Hmm ? This can 't be the only way . Check the map . If you want to get home before Tristan slaughters your people , this is the only way . Clarke ! The carts . What the hell is this ? Tunnel on the right will lead you to the woods near your camp . Take this . - What are you gonna do ? - I 'm gonna lead them away . Wait until they follow me . Then run . For Octavia . Wait a second . If they catch you , they 'll kill you . Worry about yourselves . Most of Tristan 's rangers will be at your gate by nightfall . But he 'll send riders ahead , scouts . All of you have to be gone before they arrive . One of them is coming . Where are we supposed to go ? In my book , there 's a map . Try the course to the eastern sea . There 's a clan there . Led by a woman called Luna , a friend . Tell her I sent you . Thank you . Just get Octavia out of there . Let 's go ! Oh , my God ! Did you see that ? Clarke , we need to keep moving . They 're alive . Oh , my God ! Clarke , look out ! They 're coming back . Finn ? Come on , we 've gotta go . Get up . Get up ! You know , I gotta hand it to you , Bellamy . You got them all fooled . They actually look up to you . Almost as much as they look up to Clarke . Yeah , but we know the truth , don 't we ? You 're a coward . I learned that the day you kicked out the crate from beneath me . I think I found it . Get outside . Be ready when it opens . But you were just giving the people what they wanted , right ? I should have stopped them . Yeah , it 's a little late for that now . You think they 're just gonna let you walk out of here ? Well , I think the princess is dead . And I know the king 's about to die , so who 's gonna lead these people ? Me . That 's who . And yeah , maybe I have to kill your Grounder-pounding little sister . I 'm guessing that 's her right now . Using your hands is a cheat . Mine were bound , remember ? Raven , you did it ! Bell , hold on ! - Bell , breathe ! - Breathe ! Can you breathe ? Come on ! You 're okay . You 're okay . Raven , he 's fine ! Murphy ! Murphy ! It 's over ! Murphy ! There 's only one way out of this for you now ! You wanna bet ? - This doesn 't look right . - What the hell was that back there ? Why would they keep them alive ? I swear to God , the more we learn about this place , the less we know . Hey , hey . Hey ! He would have killed us . You did what you had to do . We all have . I should have fought for you . - Finn , don 't . - Clarke . I love you . I 'm in love with you . You broke my heart . I 'm sorry . L ... I just can 't . - It came from the camp . - We 're too late . Murphy ! The guy knows how to make an exit . - Should we go after him ? - No . Grounders will take care of Murphy . We 're going after Clarke , Finn and Monty . You and Raven were right . We don 't abandon our own . Two guns , you and me , that 's it . Raven stays here to build up defenses . We lost a day because of this , and our gunpowder . - Raven ! - No , wait . Look , I just ... Thank you . Long way from whatever the hell you want . All gunners , we got movement outside the south wall ! Wait ! Hold your fire ! It 's Clarke and Finn , open the gate ! Get the gate ! Move it ! Move it ! - Clarke and Finn , they 're back ! - Close the gate ! We heard an explosion . What happened ? - Murphy happened . - Thank God ! Where have you been ? - Where 's Monty ? - Monty 's gone ? Clarke , we need to leave , now . All of us do ! There 's an army of Grounders , unlike anything we 've ever seen , coming for us right now . We need to pack what we can and run . Like hell we do . We knew this was coming . - Bell , we 're not prepared . - And they 're not here yet . We still have time to get ready . Besides , where would we go ? Where would we be safer than behind these walls ? There 's an ocean to the east . People there will help us . - We saw Lincoln . - Yeah . You expect us to trust a Grounder ? This is our home now ! We built this from nothing with our bare hands ! Our dead are buried behind that wall , in this ground ! Our ground ! The Grounders think they can take that away . They think that because we came from the sky , we don 't belong here . But they 're yet to realize one very important fact . We 're on the ground now . - And that means we are Grounders ! - Yeah ! - Grounders with guns ! - Damn right . I say let them come . Bellamy 's right . If we leave , we may never find a place as safe as this . And God knows , in this world we could be faced with something even worse tomorrow . But that doesn 't change the simple fact that if we stay here , we will die tonight . So pack your things . Just take what you can carry . Now ! Where is he ? Help me ! Hey , it 's Raven ! Raven ! - Murphy shot her . - Get her into the dropship . Clarke ! Leaving here is a mistake . - The decision 's been made . - Crowds make bad decisions . Just ask Murphy . Leaders do what they think is right . I am . What if we jettison sections three through seven ? Sir , we 've run every scenario twice . There are no more options . I would really like to be with my wife . Chancellor on deck . At ease , Sinclair . - Anything to report ? - No , sir . Nothing we 've tried will save the Ark . Have you tried not saving it ? What is this about ? It 's about going home . From where I stand , we have two options ... Die in space , or probably die trying to get to the ground . We have no more Exodus ships , sir . You 're wrong , Kane . There is one . We call it the Ark . Sinclair , please tell us what would happen if we use the thrusters that keep the Ark in orbit to propel us into the atmosphere instead . The Ark would break apart , first into its original 12 stations , then further as the violence intensified . Ninety-five percent of the structures would explode on the way down . Think you 're smart enough to pinpoint the five percent that wouldn 't ? Are we really gonna do this ? Bring the Ark to the ground ? You have a better idea ? What do you say , Abby ? You ready to see your daughter again ?

 BARBIE : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . Melanie Cross , 1988 . It 's ... me . BIG JIM : It 's some kind of energy source . That egg needs to go now . ( yells ) Melanie ! Melanie ! The way to Zenith is blocked ? Oh , it 's more than blocked ... it 's gone . And then we can be a family again . - You 're a liar ! - You 're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg . - Jim ! - Lyle ? PAULINE : Now that we 're back , whatever 's gonna happen , we need Lyle . The dome 's contracting . You mean , it 's shrinking ? JOE : I don 't know why , but it keeps starting and stopping . At least the dome stopped spinning and inverting the atmosphere . That 's why the temperature 's warmed up . Yeah , but now it 's shrinking . First , that earthquake struck , then it got super-cold in here , and now this . Do you think the dome could be evolving ? And into what ? I d ... I don 't know . JOE : Why is it moving again ? Look , I will figure it out , okay ? In the meantime , spread the word to get people to the center of town . Use walkies , go to their houses . Just get them there ... now . To everything there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven ... A time to be born , a time to die , a time to plant , a time to pluck that which ... - ( droning ) - is planted . Thank God it 's warming up again . Well , whatever happens , we 'll get through it together , if that 's what you want . PAULINE : Did you hear that ? Yeah . Can 't be the egg , though . Right ? No , it 's something else . ( droning ) Lyle . You should be resting after everything you 've been through . You hear that ? Huh ? I think we 're all gonna be resting pretty soon . Did Jim tell you about what I saw ? A fresh vision of hell on my way back here . Yeah , he did . You 've been through a lot . Which is all the more reason for you to rest . There 's a cot down this hallway . Come on . I 'll ... I 'll follow you anywhere , Pauline . Hi . Hey . You 're awake . It 's good to see you , too . How do you feel ? Better . I think . It seems warmer . Cold snap 's over . But ? James , I can tell something else is wrong . I think the dome is closing in around us . What ? We 're gonna figure out how to stop it . And we 'll find out how to get you better . Actually , I ... I think I know where I might be able to get some answers . Go . I 'll be fine . I 'll send someone to sit with you . All right , come one . Around this way . Get to the high school ... - All right ? You 'll be safe there . - JOE ( walkie ) : Barbie , you seeing this ? Yeah , Joe , I-I see what 's happening with the dome , all right ? I 'm just helping people out of their homes . Okay , let 's regroup back at the school . I 'll talk to you soon . You should take that . He was your husband . That was my old life . Can you , uh , pass me Pauline 's journal ? Just there . ( droning ) The dome has taken so much from all of us . Now this . All that matters is that we survive . And we 're going to . We 're gonna give it our damndest . Let 's go . - Oh , my God , it 's close . - Okay , let 's go this way . Let 's go ! Did I hear that the dome is contracting ? Yeah , I saw it with my own eyes . How fast is it moving ? I 'm still doing the calculations , Jim . So , just do what you do best , keep people calm , and ... Hey . Welcome to our new nightmare . That 's stating the obvious . I figured out that at its present rate of stopping and starting , - it won 't be long before the dome ... - Crushes us completely ? - Here , I 'll take that . - Thanks . The way every house , tree and square foot of dirt is gonna pile up inside here , we 'll be dead long before the walls get to us . I just can 't believe that . Big Jim threw the egg off the cliff , I 'd say that proves it 's the dome 's power source . No , I mean , that the dome would kill us all . Oh , because the dome told you it 's here to protect us , right ? You think I imagined that ? I don 't know . It would be nice to have some proof . Look , I appreciate what you do , all right ? You 've helped all of us . But maybe with everything that we 've seen , you could admit there 's more going on here . - Okay , I 'm d ... - BARBIE : Now 's not the time to debate this . All right ? Okay , you 're right . Excuse me . Let 's help everybody settle in . NORRIE : Barbie , Julia ! I 'm glad you guys are safe . I 'm not so sure . What do you mean ? Hunter , here , has something he would like to confess . Isn 't that right , Hunter ? Look , when I came back from Zenith with you , I was ... I was secretly working for your dad . What ? HUNTER : He blackmailed me into spying on you ... to find a way to get the egg to Zenith . Which I never got to do , because Big Jim tossed it first . Look , I am on your side , I swear ! Barbie , it 's true . Hunter stopped that military guy outside the dome from doing experiments on the egg , because he knew it was hurting Melanie . There 's gonna be a lot more people hurt if we don 't find a way to stop these wall from shrinking . Barbie , I 'm really sorry ! You don 't get to talk ! You two go help out . You going somewhere ? I said ... go help out . Okay . Fine . You good ? I 'll keep an eye on Melanie . - What are you doing ? - Shut up and walk . Let 's go . 02x12 - " Turn " Downloaded from G2G.fm Ben ? Hey . You okay ? It 's over , Norrie . No , it 's not . I just saw the guy who owned the hardware store get his car crushed when the dome smashed into it . - Is he okay ? - He 's dead . Before too long , we 're all gonna be dead , too . No , we 're not ... because we 're gonna find a way out of here somehow , someway . We are not gonna die in here . You know how I know it 's all over ? How ? The girl who bitched and moaned about how much she hates this place is now telling me everything 's gonna be okay . - Norrie , let 's go . - Why ? I saw Barbie leading Hunter away from the school . Barbie did not look happy . - Where are they going ? - I don 't know , that 's why we have to follow them . Well , whatever they 're up to , Barbie obviously didn 't want us coming along . But if it 's Barbie , he 's probably got a plan to stop what 's happening . Don 't you want to see what he 's up to ? But why do we have to go home ? Because maybe one of your old paintings shows us how we can stop the dome from contracting . I mean , it showed it coming down . It showed the pink stars falling . Go , have a look , but I could be of more use here . What , comforting Lyle ? Is that what this is about ? He 's out of his gourd . His his was pretty soft to begin with . Are you sorry you saved him from drowning ? No , I mean , you wanted him here , and , you know , I did it for you . - ( scoffs ) That 's a new one . - What do you mean ? That night at the Senior Dance , when Lyle got drunk and dragged me onto the dance floor , you said ... the last place I should be is anywhere near him . Still took you six months to dump him . But I did ... eventually . So , let 's go solve this together . _ _ PAULINE : James , what are you doing here ? - It 's about Melanie . - Is she better ? She tries to act like it , but I 'm still worried . - Wa-Wait , who 's Melanie ? - None of your business . - I need to talk to you in pri ... - N-N-N-No , who is Melanie ? You 've seen her around ... Melanie Cross . Melanie Cross , wasn 't that a friend of yours ? - Didn 't she go missing 25 years ago ? - She died . She died ? W-Wh ... How 's she back ? The dome , it ... Jim , it 's true ... Melanie Cross is alive again . Except this time , she 's really sick . When we came back into Chester 's Mill , I had a vision of Melanie in the crater . - She looked ... odd . - Like she was sick ? Maybe , but when I took her hand , she seemed better . Okay , then what happened ? Then I surfaced in the lake . Please . You have to try to get that vision back and paint her . - James . - If you paint her all healed , - then I know she 's not gonna die . - James ! My visions stopped when the egg left Chester 's Mill . Please try ! We have to try everything ! James , I would do anything for you , I came back for you . But my visions are gone . I don 't know if I can get them back . Now Melanie is dying because you screwed up , and threw that egg over the cliff . All of this is your fault ! I only did that to try to get you and your mom out of here . Look at the mess you 've made . Have you found anything to help her , yet ? You sound doubtful that I will . Nothing would make me happier , Rebecca . But in the meantime , you 'd like to try what , exactly , a s√©ance ? Is that really what you think I believe ? No . We both want what 's best for her and this town . But while you 're busy asking why the dome would betray us , I 'm asking how do we stop it before it kills us all . Have you ever considered it might take both questions to save us ? Have you ever considered it might not ? - ( coughing ) - Melanie ? Melanie ? JULIA : Melanie ? Oh , what is going on ? I don 't know . She doesn 't have a fever , so I doubt it 's an infection . Her body 's falling apart . Something must be happening with the egg . And it 's killing her . It could be a bunch of things ... poisoning , autoimmune deficiency ... Is that why her hair is falling out ? Maybe . Any other symptoms ? All I know is ... when the egg disappeared , her health went downhill . How 's her blood look ? Same way she does . Her red blood cells seem to be disintegrating . A transfusion might buy her some time . Yeah , except if we give her the wrong type , it 'll kill her . Well , that 's a risk we have to take . We don 't have the equipment to type blood . Lima beans . Come again ? The lectins in lima beans , they react to the surface of red blood cells . If we mash them up , mix them with the blood , we can determine blood type . Let 's just hope she responds to a transfusion . Why wouldn 't she ? Has anyone told you about this girl ? What about her ? It 's a weird story . Come on , I 'd bet Andrea has lima beans at her house . Oh , God . She is worse . We 're doing everything we can . Me , too . Uh , do you know where my mom 's journal is ? It 's in that box . Why ? James ? I can 't believe we lucked out like this . - Thank God for hoarders , right ? - Right . So , you want to tell me this weird story about Melanie ? Which part ? How she was my high school girlfriend ? Or how she died 25 years ago , but is now alive again ? - Excuse me ? - You asked . Sam , people don 't die and come back to life . I mean , they can be medically resuscitated , but not after two decades . And yet , here she is . And that is the girl I knew . Your sister faked her own death , - I-I don 't know , maybe Melanie somehow ... - Rebecca , I saw her die . And I know death when I see it . Why the stupid grin , Lyle ? I see you have an eye now for your mother 's artwork . The real question is why she ever had eyes for you . Your mother saw that she needed someone to nurture her gifts , not doubt them . - And you 're that someone ? - Well , it wasn 't your dad . She sent me those postcards from the last nine years . You know why ? Because she trusted me to understand them . You want me to do the same thing for you ? Why ? To make up for hitting you with the fire poker , and for stealing the journal . Okay . Find something in here that might help Melanie . JUNIOR : That 's you and Sam , my mom and Melanie , right ? On our way to the crater , 25 years ago . - That 's the night Melanie died . - That 's not gonna happen again . If only you knew what I know . Junior , we 're all gonna die inside this thing . Just focus on the drawings . I am not seeing anything . Are you sure ? You didn 't paint a vision of a ... of a new tunnel , or a ... or a hole in the dome somewhere ? If I had , we would have found it by now . Listen , we are not gonna get crushed in this dome 'cause I screwed up and threw that egg over . There 's got to be something here . SAM : You okay ? REBECCA : Mm-hmm . Yeah , just glad I 'm the right blood type . All right . Give me a shout if you need anything . Thanks . What 's going on ? Um , we 're transfusing you . I 'm gonna find out why you 're sick . Not knowing makes you mad , huh ? A little . My mom used to kiss my forehead when she took my temperature . Did your mom do that ? I don 't remember . She died when I was eight . I 'm sorry . I wanted a reason . Someone to tell me why she was taken from me . Maybe some questions have no answers . You sound like Julia . Is that such a bad thing ? There 's a better thing , Melanie ... knowing . People have always wondered about the world . Why the sun rises and sets . Why spring turns to summer and then autumn . Why loved ones get sick . How to make them better . You know , knowing the answers doesn 't take away the wonder , it actually makes it more amazing . Then tell me why I 'm dying . 'Cause I 'm not just sick , am I ? I 'm dying . - Listen . - All that matters is , the first time I died , I was all alone . Now I have you . And Julia . And my brother . It was worth coming back just for that . It 's stopping again . ( leaves rustling ) Hey , your plan worked . We need the egg back ... now ! _ Son , you know I 'd do anything to help . But I can 't make that happen . _ All right , well then your son and your daughter die in here . _ Melanie disappeared years ago . _ No . She is alive . In here . With us . _ No , that can 't be possible . _ Joe ! Norrie ! Get your asses out here ! How 'd you know we were following you ? Yeah , because stealth is not your strong suit . Hey , listen . I need to convince my dad about Melanie , okay ? So , do you have any photos , or ... I 've got something better ... a vlog . - JOE : As the newest arrival - Yeah , show him . in Chester 's Mill , how do you like it so far ? - Everyone 's so sad . - Yeah . JOE : I guess there was no dome last time you lived here . Is there something I can do to help ? DON : That 's enough . How ? Because that egg brought her back . Without that here in Chester 's Mill , she dies , and all of us die , too . It 's starting again . _ Barbie , he isn 't getting it . Tell him it 's more than just a thing ... it 's alive somehow . It knows us . Barbie , the egg is upset being out there . If he gives it back , - this could be our way out ... - O-Okay , I-I got ... Get out of here . Go ! ( typing ) _ Is this smart ? He could bring his whole army through with him . Well , we take that risk or we get crushed to death in here . Tell him to go through the red door of that root cellar at his house . _ Be careful . The lake 's where we came through from Zenith . Someone should be there when he shows up . Look , it 's stopping . - You 're not going anywhere . - Joe and I 'll go . Fine . You guys go get a walkie then head on out to the lake , but actually hide this time , all right ? You stay out of sight . When my dad shows up , you radio me . - Go . - Will do . Think your dad will really go get that egg ? The dome 'll let us know . Julia . Hey . - The dome stopped contracting . - What ? I met with my dad and I convinced him to get that egg back to us . Literally , soon as he left , the walls just stopped shrinking . Maybe the dome must have wanted the egg back , too . When it saw your dad was gonna make that happen , - it gave us a sign . - I can 't say for sure , but I don 't know how else to explain it . Guys , come here , quick . Melanie . - Hi . - Hey , how you feeling ? Like myself again . The transfusion worked . Well , that , and we 're also getting that egg back . That 's why I 'm getting better . I guess when it 's okay , you 're okay . Listen ... the transfusion only buys us some time . She 's still very sick . Well , whatever it is , she 's a hell of a lot better right now than she was . All right ? That 's all that matters to me . Hello ? Hello ? Can anyone hear me ? All the batteries in these walkies are dead . Ones over here are , too . Barbie , can you read me ? - Yeah , Norrie , I read you . - Great , just checking . We 'll radio you when your dad gets here . Roger that . All right , we got one . We 're good to go . We sure are . What is that ? - It 's a gun . - Yes , Joe , I 'm aware it 's a gun . But what are you doing with it ? We 're taking it with us . No , you 're gonna put that down . - Relax , I checked . It 's not even loaded . - Yeah , and it 's not going to be , because you 're gonna put it back in that drawer , - find the key and lock it the hell up . - Norrie . Joe , the one and only time you have ever held a gun you almost shot Melanie in the face . - Okay , in other words , I didn 't . - It 's not coming with us . Barbie thinks his dad could be dangerous . Hunter does , too . We need it for protection in case he tries anything when he gets here . You want protection ? Just get behind me . Plus , if Don Barbara does show up with the egg , it 's gonna be because he wants to help us , not hurt us . - All right . - Let 's go . It 's not gonna end this way . N-Not after all we 've been through , not after the dome brought you back to me and Junior . I wish I could see something to paint ... - anything to get us out of here . - What if I can help ? You can 't fix me . It 's like I 'm drowning . I 'm looking for shore and all I see is darkness . Okay , you can 't see , but ... but can you feel ? Yes . I feel . ( sighs ) I feel alone . Ashamed . Of me ? No . Of me . Ashamed for letting Melanie die all those years ago . Ashamed for losing faith in you . Ashamed of leaving my family . No , you didn 't lose faith . I 'm the one who lost faith . I didn 't understand your gifts . O-O-Or that the dome had chosen us . Now I do . How can you be sure ? Junior was chosen to bring you back to me . The dome chose to save me before I could hang myself . And it healed all those people as soon as it saw I was willing to sacrifice . You were chosen to lead Chester 's Mill . And you were chosen to show me the way . Look at that . What do you see ? - Jim ... - No , what do you see ? A blank canvas . You know what I see ? A fresh start . So you forgive me ? Yeah , I forgive you . We 've both made some pretty big mistakes . How could you have known those paintings would come to life ? They were so crazy . ( chuckles ) : Yeah , they were . No , that 's the obelisk in Zenith . That doesn 't have anything to do with Melanie . There 's got to be something in here that shows Melanie healthy . Here , l-let me try and find something . Is that me and Melanie ? She looks fine in that one . Mm-mm . No , the way I see it , that 's your mother and me entering heaven together . Just like I always hoped . Don 't even say that . You asked . Sir , I know he 's your son , but you need to rethink this . My instincts have gotten us all this far . You need to trust me , Malick . But you can 't even touch it . It 's injured anyone that 's even gotten near it . BARBIE : Joe , any sign of my dad yet ? Not him , not the egg ... nothing . All right . Well , give it a little longer . When you saw him , did he remember me ? Yeah , a father doesn 't forget his daughter . I remember his face . It was the day I met you . He seemed sad , like he already knew . He already knew what ? That if we met , we wouldn 't want to say good-bye . Well ... This time , we won 't have to . Mr. Barbara , no . Time to do what I need to do . - What the hell ? - Sir , that needs to remain here . - Tell ' em to back off , Malick . - I take orders , just like you . ( gasping ) Melanie ? What 's happening to me ? Stay calm . Sam ? ! I thought he promised to help . All right , hang in there , Melanie . Sam ? ! - What happened ? - She was having trouble breathing . She just passed out . Come on . I know we 've screwed up . Over and over again . But even with everything that 's happened , I still choose to believe you 're trying to protect us . I think that when you ... stopped moving , that was your way of giving all of us another chance , so I need to ask you for one more thing . Please help Melanie . She deserves to live . Everyone in here does . You said that I was chosen . Well , if I was , then that has to be for something . So if someone has to die , then let it be me . Just please , don 't take any more of them . ( droning ) ( liquid dripping ) - ( knocking ) - Sorry . - How 's it going ? - It started working . A vision came through . - You painted two ? - No , just one . Does it show me how to save the town ? No , it 's more what Junior wanted . - You need to keep painting then . - I can 't . Well , what 's it mean ? I 'm not sure , but I think it tells us how to save Melanie . The eight hands are to heal her ? Now I know why I wanted Sam and Lyle to come back with me . The eight hands ... four old , four new ... working together to make her well again . Yeah , but Angie 's dead , so there 's only seven . Who 's the eight ? - I don 't know . - Doesn 't matter . The dome knows . Besides , if you painted it , it must be true . - Where do we start ? - The school . All right , let 's go . ( clears his throat ) ( sighs ) ( door closing ) It 's the first time I 've seen you sit still . How 's Melanie ? She 's back to the way she was . I just don 't get it , Sam . Why the transfusion didn 't work ? Why she got better , why she got sick again . Most of all , who she even is . Her coming back after all these years contradicts every law of physics , biology . That 's-that 's everything that I have ever believed in . Science doesn 't have every answer . ( sighs ) Well , I just can 't give up like you and Julia . It 's not giving up . It 's letting go . There 's a difference . Which is ? Knowing there are things you don 't know and still being okay with it . Come on , what do you say you and I go face this uncertainty together ? Guess that 's an answer I 'll have to accept , right ? BIG JIM : Where 's Melanie ? - SAM : Why ? - I painted a vision . It may show us how to save her . And you 're in on this ? All that matters is you believe my wife . If we can save Melanie , we can save this town . Well , we better hurry . The dome is closing in again , this time , even faster . So he didn 't show up at the lake . No , but Pauline thinks there 's a way to heal Melanie . Without Don bringing the egg ? Pauline wants us all together ... the old and new hands . Can I go ? You 've come this far . - You ready to go ? - Yeah , just tell us when . - You 're coming , too ? - Mm-hmm . Wasn 't sure anything this unscientific would interest you . Well , if this is a way to heal Melanie , I want to see it . Maybe we can both be right , Julia . Is it true ? The dome 's contracting faster now ? It 's exactly why we need to hurry . So , our dad didn 't do what he promised . ( sighs ) All that matters is what I promise . We 're gonna make you better . You sure this 'll help her ? I 'm only sure that we have to try . No matter what happens today , I love you , James . Never forget that . What do you mean ? Years ago , I left you . It was a mistake . It 's not gonna happen again . I forgive you , Mom , but why are you saying this ? ( footsteps approaching ) - Everything okay here ? - We 're fine . Let 's get ready to head out . And , James , please try to forgive him . What the hell 's he doing here ? You know he 's one of the original four . It 's a great day to do something wonderful . Stay away from my family . PAULINE : When I came back to Chester 's Mill , I had a dream of seeing Melanie in the center . Put her there . Hold on . Put her here . Hey . Hey , you 're gonna be fine . So , what now ? PAULINE : I 'm not exactly sure . The painting was more symbolic . - Well , she 's barely breathing . - BIG JIM : Barbie , let her do her thing . All hands surround her . Everyone kneel down . Junior , you grab her hand . Everyone else , get ready to lay a hand on her . Okay , now . ( sighs ) Nothing 's happening . - Are we ... are we doing something wrong ? - Jim , maybe you 're right . We don 't have enough hands without Angie . - We have to heal her . - I 'm sorry . I 'm trying . JUNIOR : Hey , what 's happening to her ? - She 's seizing . - PAULINE : We can 't do it , not without all the eight hands . We only have seven . Wait . We do have eight . Melanie counts as two hands . The girl she was in the past , and the girl she is now . Replacing Angie ? She can 't be two people at once . No , not two people . The same person in two different times , past and present . Quantum physics says an object ... An object can be in two places at once . Exactly . So if Melanie is the bridge between past and present , - the seventh and eighth hand ... - Someone take her other hand . James , you 're the hand from the present . Sam , you dated her 25 years ago . You do it . Everyone else lay a hand on her again . Is it working ? Her seizures stopped . PAULINE : Don 't let go . LYLE : Hey ! Hey ! - What the hell is happening ? - Steady , Lyle . It 's okay . It 's okay , Lyle . She 's waking ! JUNIOR : Melanie , are you okay ? She looks better than okay to me . Pauline . It 's so beautiful . Oh . - Melanie ! - Hey ! - ( screaming ) - SAM : No ! - Melanie . Grab my hand ! Grab my hand ! - ( screaming ) - SAM : Hold on to her . - I 'm trying ! SAM : Don 't let her go ! ( crying ) Okay , hold on ! Hold on ! - Barbie . - Hold onto her . Don 't let go ! - ( screaming ) - Melanie ! - No . - ( indistinct shouting ) - Oh ! - Melanie ! - Where did she go ? - I don 't know . - We have to go after her ! - No , no , no . BARBIE : Hey , you don 't know where that goes . You jumped out there not knowing , both of you did ! Yeah , and then , Phil jumped and died instantly . Same thing could happen here ! He 's right , Junior . We got to be smart about this , figure it out first . Is this the way you painted it ? I thought it showed her healed , but ... - BIG JIM : Wait . - Pauline ! - Pauline ! - In my dream , I saw Melanie disappear , but I didn 't know it meant that . Maybe she 's alive somehow . - You saw what happened . It 's my fault ! - No one 's blaming you . You tried to help . I love you . I love you , too . Pauline ? You know why ? 'Cause she 's supposed to be with me , Jim . Always has been supposed to be with me . The red paint ... it was my blood . - What-what do you mean ? - The dome wanted me to sacrifice . LYLE : So that she and I could be in heaven together . Forever . Us . Us . ( panting ) ( grunting ) - ( grunts ) - ( laughs ) You g ... you got me . You got me . ( panting ) ( laughs ) ( grunting ) - Oh , g ... - ( groans ) Oh . Oh ... Thank you , Jim . Thank you . Uh-huh . ( panting ) ( grunts ) ( panting ) Pauline . Pauline . ( panting ) Why ? ‚ô™ A time to gain ‚ô™ ‚ô™ A time to lose ‚ô™ ‚ô™ A time to rend ‚ô™ ‚ô™ A time to sew ‚ô™ ‚ô™ A time for love ‚ô™ - ‚ô™ A time for hate ‚ô™ - Why ? ! - ‚ô™ A time for peace ‚ô™ - ( panting ) ‚ô™ I swear it 's not too late . ‚ô™ For more new Episodes go to G2G.fm

 I cut my arm . Look at it . It 's not healing . - Do you mean ... ? - I 'm staying hurt . Don 't you see ? The whole world becomes immortal . And I 'm mortal . I don 't mend . I 'm normal again . This , Captain , fascinates me . - What makes you so different ? - I don 't know . And yet you 're the only one left , the only true human . So tell me , what did you give them so long ago ? Why would he want you dead ? On the very day that no one 's dying ? Wish I knew . Every time you turn up it always go wrong . Where are you from ? Long ago and so far away . ( Boat horn blowing ) ( People chatting ) Man : Harkness . Anyone ? Jack Harkness . I 'm looking for Jack Harkness . That 's me . Welcome to America , Mr. Harkness . There 's your visa all stamped . Grazie . I mean , thank you very much , inspector . Hey , wait ! Stop that man ! ( Whistle blowing ) Come on now . You 're not Jack Harkness . The visa 's mine . It 's what ? You 'll find everything 's in order . The British consulate arranged for my travel through the embassy in Rome . That visa belongs to me . Yes sir . Terribly sorry this happened , sir . Take him away . Send him back home . There you are . Thank you . ( Lock clicking ) You 're still here . Thought you 'd be in the city by now . Time to spare . Waiting for the next boat to Manhattan . I also am waiting for a boat . Mine goes all the way back to Italy . Right . That 's what they do with thieves . An interesting fact is they do it also with people who forge visas . Good eye . Why didn 't you tell them ? I wasn 't sure until that moment when you said , " Why didn 't you tell them ? " ( Chuckles ) I 'm on a kind of unofficial official visit , one part of the government pretending to be another part . You work for a government ? Look at me . Do I look like a bureaucrat ? Never seen a man like you before . More like a soldier . Your English is good . Where did you learn ? We had a schoolmaster in the village . He taught me . I went to him every single day because I always dreamt of coming here . - What 's the village ? - You wouldn 't know it . No one ever does . Tiny place on the Almafi Coast . And I mean , for certain , right on the coast , the whole place is holding its breath on the edge of a clifftop . You look over , hundreds of feet down to the sea . Sounds beautiful . Why 'd you ever leave ? New York . They have buildings here taller than the cliff . - I wanted to see that . - You wait . They 've only just started building . Years to come , they 're gonna have ... What ? They 're gonna have what ? Never mind . What 's your name ? Angelo Colasanto . Angelo Colasanto . - La magia oscura . - It 's not magic . Technology . Sometimes they 're indistinguishable . - Hey hey hey . - How does it work ? Can I see it ? Hey , over here . We just found this man 's papers . You can let him go . We 're going to Manhattan .

( Phone ringing ) Rhys , call me , okay ? ( Beeps ) Mom , if you can , call me , okay ? Rex : Vera ! Vera ! Vera . How many views have we got now ? Um , over five million . People are setting up memorial services for her too . Just random people who didn 't even know her . I just , um- - you got the footage and that 's gonna make the difference . But I 've been meaning to say I- - I know that that must have been- - - I 'm sorry . - I got ya . Really , Rex . I really didn 't even know her that well , okay ? But you did . You must have talked . Look , she- - she told me about her mother , her ex-husband , possibly something about a brother or a sister . I don 't know , maybe not . - The obituary says- - - Yeah , but what does it matter ? Hmm ? Whoever she was , it 's gone . I don 't even know where she 's from . - The news is saying San Antonio . - Well , then go Spurs . Sorry . I don 't know how to help . Except that ... maybe her death has changed things . They 'll shut down the camps . No , they paused the camps . That 's all they 're saying- - paused . And while the politicians are all denying everything , those ovens are still out there waiting to burn . Jack . - Gwen , you 're back . - Where 's Jack ? Sorry about your dad . Did you hear any news ? No , not really . - Jack ! - He went outside . - Jack ? - Hey , I missed you . I 've been searching through that blessing stuff . Listen , you 've got to come down to the car . - I 've got to show you something . - Anything good ? No , just stuff from back home . Souvenir sort of thing . Just you and me . Come on . All right , stop your nagging . Told you she missed me . Gwen : Yeah , today would be good , Jack . ( Door shuts ) - Bad day , Gwen ? - ( Scoffs ) - ( Crackles ) - ( Groans ) ( Horn honks ) All right . Okay . ( Speaking Italian ) I 'm sorry . My Italian isn 't so ... She 's saying there 's only one bed . ( Speaks Italian ) I said I 'll sleep on the floor . On the floor , yes . He 'll sleep on the floor . ( Speaking Italian ) Come down to the shop anytime . Family butcher 's is fine food . And you are family now . ( Laughs ) ( Door shuts ) It 's a good room . And it 's cheap . You should save your money , Angelo Colasanto . Next couple of years , earn as much as you can . Save it all up 'cause you 're gonna need it . Bad times ahead . Why , what 's going to happen ? Oh , so many things . Don 't worry . It gets better . Then it gets worse again . You talk funny . I 'm a very funny man . Scars . You been in a lot of fights ? Sometimes you have to defend yourself , you know ? People say things . Hey , she was right . Not much of a view , huh ? ( Laughs ) A person could argue . You like that , don 't you ? I like a lot of things . - She 's beautiful . - You like her too ? Of course I do . What would you like to do to her ? You tell me . I 'd strip off her clothes . Maybe a little too quickly . Something might tear . Girls don 't like that . She 's not most girls . She 's strong . She 'd rip open my shirt . And what then ? I 'd move in close so I can smell her and she can smell me . Then what ? Kiss her . Yeah ? I 'm kissing her . Yeah ? Kissing so deep , like there 's not enough air in the room . You know what that 's like ? When it starts being all teeth and wet and hot . And you 're just breathing them in . I like New York . You haven 't seen much yet . What I 've seen is , eh , it 's okay . ( Chuckles ) What are you looking for ? I mean in America . ( Sighs ) Speed , change , new things . People moving so fast they are not looking at me so I can move fast on my own , faster than anyone . Spoken like a true American . Really ? Turn out the lights . We can talk till we fall asleep . I thought you 'd want me to go . No . I mean , if you want to stay ... Turn out the lamp . You 've never done this ? No . The other part , yes . This part , no . What happened to your eye ? I was born with it . So ... Who was your first ? A boy from my village . In secret . In the woods , you know ? What about that schoolmaster of yours ? No . What makes you say that ? He was my teacher . - He was my friend . - Okay . I was just joking . But why ? What 's so funny ? I don 't understand . We just did something special . Why do you make it cheap ? I suppose I do sometimes . I 'm sorry . Really . I 'm sorry , okay ? How did you know ? About me , that I was like this ? Just experience , that 's all . So ... Anyone looking at me , would they know ? No . - Trust me , you 're safe . - Okay . People wouldn 't know if you don 't want them to know . - Okay . Okay then . - Okay . Okay . But you too mostly . Most of the time . Keep your hands down maybe . ( Laughs ) I really don 't care what people know . Where are you from ? Italian visa , British passport . A magical island called Torchwood . What does that mean ? You keep saying things that don 't make sense . You 'll learn to love it . It makes me more interesting . - ( Fireworks exploding ) - What 's that ? ( Men shouting ) No really , there are bombs . Welcome to America , Angelo . Happy 4th of July . ( Tires squealing ) Radio : Another nonstop hour of music , weather- - ( changing stations ) And allegations continue to surface about procedures at the new medical facilities . But Oswald Danes has released a statement in which he says that a global emergency calls for emergency measures and he advocated a swift return to the category policy . ( Groans ) I 'm tied down . - Why am I tied down ? - They 're in my eyes . - What ? - They 're in my eyes . The contacts . They 're in my eyes . Somebody 's taken Anwen , Rhys , my mother , the whole bloody family . And they 've said if I bring you , they 'll let them go unharmed . Don 't try moving . You 'll never get out of those knots . My hands are asleep . And my feet . You tied my feet ? Of course I did , stupid . Otherwise you 'd get out of the car , knock me out and turn the car around . Are you sure they have your family ? I phoned 100 times . There 's no reply . They 've got them . I want to talk to the lenses . Look at me so I can talk to them . Why do you always keep thinking you can tell me what to do ? Pull over or look into the rearview . Just please , let me talk to them . Don 't cock this up , okay ? Listen , whoever you are , there 's more than one way to play this . Are you listening ? Yeah , there 's a cursor . They 're there . You want me ? Let her family go and I 'll come to you alone . - Tell them they can have me too . - No , just me . Let Rhys go , let Anwen go , let her mother go free . You guys , you know what ? Here I am . You got me . - Nothing . - Give them a minute . - There 's just nothing now . - Maybe they 're thinking about it . My mother 's name is Mary . Mary ! You 've known me all this time and you can 't remember her name ? - All right , I 'm sorry , okay ? - Well , you should be , because this is all your fault . They want to kill you , but why do they want to do that ? - I don 't know . - What have you done ? I don 't know . Well , you 've done something , haven 't you ? Way back when in that long bloody life of yours . God , you 've lived so long you can 't remember half of it . Now you think . Think . What the hell have you done ? I love this . I love weddings . I don 't believe in marriage . So young , so handsome and so cynical . Look at them . What are their chances ? That 's what makes it so brave and wonderful- - making a promise and going forward . It doesn 't matter what happens in the future . Right now it 's real and it happens and it 's true . You 're Catholic , right ? Do you want to kneel down like that ? He doesn 't hear me . He doesn 't hear you ? Why ? You know why . That 's our padre . Wait here . Jack : Forgive me , father , for I have sinned so many times , and that 's just today . It 's been about 700 years since my last confession . Where do I start ? How about the triplets ? Or the naked circus ? Or that sapphic leapfrog jamboree ? ( Chuckles ) Ahem . No . Let 's just start with the sin of " Father Timothy sent me . " ( Door clicks ) - You 're Jack Harkness ? - Good to see you , Father . I believe we 're gonna talk business . The Volstead Act makes an exception for sacramental wines . And the brothers upstate produce more than we can use . The extra income feeds a lot of widows and orphans , I 'm sure . Yes , I 'm doing this entirely for charity , every last cent . It 's not very good . It 's the blood of Christ , Angelo . I 'm sure it 's good enough . This is just a sample . If you make enough profit , we 'll start delivering crates . We should figure out a system- - Hey , what are you doing ? - Who are you ? - It 's okay . Let them take us , Angelo . - It 's okay . - Where are they taking us ? I don 't know where . Just east . Did they say get on the 10 going east ? Or on the eastbound 10 Freeway or what ? If they said highway , they could be from back east . If their grammar was wrong , it could mean that English is not their first language . I didn 't notice anything wrong with it . You 're Welsh . You wouldn 't notice if the vowels were missing . Button it . Hey , you 've got a gun , haven 't you ? - You could smuggle it back here to me . - It 's gone . They made me leave it behind . Just give it up , Jack , with all this planning , okay ? Because if there was a way out of this , I can guarantee you I would have thought of it . Gwen , I shouldn 't- - there are reasons I shouldn 't even say this- - secrets- - but we could find Anwen . My wrist strap , it could find her . We could save her . What ? It 's coded to my D.N.A. And it resonates to anything close to my D.N.A. If you are using my daughter as leverage , I swear to God I will kill you myself . Listen to me . If we recode it to your D.N.A. , then Anwen is a close match . It would respond to her . Like a tracker . We could save her together . - We could rescue her . - You could do that ? - You could do that recode thing ? - Yes . A drop of your blood . A single cell would do , but a drop would be easier . - Let 's do it . - Pull over . Okay , let 's do it . I 'll have to untie you . One hand for just a second , all right , Gwen ? I 'd be saving Anwen . You bastard . Nice try . Gwen : Oh , mm-hmm . Whoever this is , they know you . So , Mr. Harkness and his acolyte . - Yeah , and who are you ? - Your friend thinks he 's funny . He doesn 't . He isn 't . He 's sorry . - This is Sal Maranzano . - You were gonna undercut my price . We found some untapped resource . Rumor is you two are a pair of finocchi . That 's not a rumor . That 's a boast . And if you were really upset about some small-time competition , it 'd already be hailing bullets . So we 're here for another reason . I don 't think so . Take ' em , kill ' em . Give us a try , Maranzano . You need men like us , off the grid . Men who could never be traced back to you . So whatever it is you need , Sal , no matter how dangerous it is , no matter how strange it is , you just found the right men . There 's a box in a warehouse that needs to find its way to another warehouse . You can count on us . You will not look in the box . Sure thing . You will swear on everything that is holy you will deliver the box , but you will not look inside . I promise . Then we got a deal . Tomorrow night , Gallaco Wharf , bay five . - Get going . - Get lost . ( Church bell ringing ) You 're running away ? No . That 's mine . What are you doing ? You 're packing my things . You need to go now . - There 's a plan . - And I 'm not part of your plan ? Look at your hands . Not a scar on them . I 'm tougher than you . Maranzano 's people have stumbled across something they 're not supposed to have . I 've got to stop them . You made this happen ? You 've planned this . Since when ? Since you got on the boat to America ? Just get out town , Angelo . These people are bad . You don 't want to be on their list . Get far away . Who are you doing this for ? The government in England ? Or the other thing you said , Torchwood ? For the train . Go to the West Coast . You 're handsome enough . Get into the movies . I 'm not letting you send me away . Why ? Because you wouldn 't know how to get another man ? Because you 're not brave enough ? You think I 'm with you because it 's easy ? It 's not easy , trust me . I know . I hear the beads clicking at night , Angelo . Everything we do , you ask for forgiveness afterwards . That 's just sex . Imagine if it was love . What would he say then , your God ? What would he say if two men could love ? Oh , but no . No , that 's impossible . And if it 's impossible , then you can 't stay with me . You ... You 're an ass . For a man who knows a lot of things , you 're not so bright . Think about it . I grew up in a village with 200 people . Only 200 . The sun would rise and the sun would set over the same 200 people . And that was it . That was my world . And look at me now . I 'm a bootlegger in New York City with you in my bed . You think any of your little secrets can change my life more than it 's already changed ? And yes , I- - I feel guilty about what we do . It hasn 't made me stop doing it . Besides , I always hoped ... If God is love , maybe he loves me too . That 's blasphemy . I think that 's Christianity . You 're unpacking my things ? I 've got this friend . He 's called the Doctor . He explores the world with a companion . It looks nice . Are you saying that I can stay ? Maybe . ( Hums ) Oh dio . What 's all this ? Ammonia refrigeration . Of course . The best they could do in 1927 . They said don 't look in the box . - Yeah right . - What is it ? What 's inside ? Someone- - someone way above Maranzano , they found something , a weapon . They told Maranzano to hold it until after the next state election , then ship it to Albany . Maranzano doesn 't know what he 's got , but he 's terrified of it . - ( Box hisses ) - Whoa ! Can 't say I blame him . No . No , that 's- - what ? ( Taps box ) ( Chuckles ) It 's a parasite . Like a bug . A parasite ? Tell me more about it . Good man . It 's a species of Brainspawn treated as vermin on more than 150 planets that I know of . And valued as dinner on one other . It tastes like oysters . You did not . I had to be polite . Now this part drills into the brain of the host and deposits its larvae there- - little worms sharp as needles pushing into the brain very slowly . You go insane , but it takes years . Franklin Roosevelt , he 's going to be elected Governor of New York this November . But he wouldn 't start making the really crazy decisions until his second term as President . Result- - America destabilizes , pulls out of the war , Germany rises , the Third Reich triumphant and there 's a whole new history sprawling out . You mean someone is changing the future ? Destroying it . Turning order into chaos and feeding off the results . Who would do such a thing ? These people above Maranzano ? They 're just being used by someone called the Trickster 's Brigade . Believe me , you don 't want to meet them . What sort of men are they ? They 're not men at all . They 're not even human . Okay . Okay . ( Exhales ) Oh , he likes you . But it 's cold , yeah ? So it 's safe . - ( Hisses ) - Oh , dio ! Ha . That 'll dissolve it . Ah . So the mission is complete . We just saved the world , Angelo . And no one will ever know . Then did I pass ? Can I stay with you like the Doctor ? Learn all the secrets ? - ( Alarm ringing ) - Here 's one of the secrets- - run ! ( Whistle blowing ) Quick . Come on , up . Go . Hold it ! Stop right there ! Take my hand . - ( Gunshot ) - Ah ! - Grab my hand ! - ( Panting ) No ! ( Dogs barking ) ( Whistle blowing ) ( Grunts ) ( Shouting in Italian ) All right , get him in there . - Go , step up . - Angelo : Jack . Get in there . Meat cart is on the way for the other one . You 'd better take the main gate . Off you go . ( Siren wailing ) ( Gasps ) ( Thunder rumbling ) - It 's me . - What do you mean ? It 's me . I caused this . I made this happen . I knew Torchwood was toxic right from the moment I joined up , the very first day , but I stayed . - I 'm glad you did . - Stop being so nice . We left nice behind 100 miles back . I 'm trying to be honest , okay ? Because do you know what the worst thing is of all ? Out of all the shit we have seen , all the bloodshed , all the horror , do you know what is worse than all of that ? I loved it . I bloody loved it . And I 'd keep telling Rhys I was sorry and I 'd say to little Anwen I 'm sorry , but I loved it so much . I knew things no one else knew and , oh , I felt so special . And when we lost people , it was so so big and I could say it was worth it because the bigger it was , the more important I was . And the more people we lost , the more that meant I was a survivor and I was better than them . My God , this is all my fault . And now they 've got my beautiful little girl and I wished this on her . I used to think the same about Torchwood . That 's what I 'm saying . Have you got what I 'm saying to you , Jack ? What I 'm saying is no more . 'Cause I know exactly what you 're thinking , Jack Harkness . I know it . She won 't do this . Not really . Not my Gwen . No , Gwen , she can 't hurt me . Gwen loves me . She 'd never hand me in . Well , this is about my daughter . And I swear , for her sake , I will see you killed like a dog right in front of me if it means her back in my arms . - Understood ? - Understood . And let me tell you , now that I 'm mortal , I 'm gonna hang on to this with everything I 've got . I love you , Gwen Cooper , but I will rip your skin from your skull before I let you take this away from me . Understood ? Understood . I feel like I know you now better than I 've ever done before . Yeah . Right at the end . Mmm . Right at the end . ( Man shouting ) Nice suit . Look , it 's all right . Don 't panic . It 's me . I 'm the same man . I saw you . I saw you get shot . - I got better . - You got shot in the head . I saw it . I saw the blood . I saw your body . - Want to see it again ? - Shut up , Jack ! This is so wrong . Tell me what happened . You were dead . Clearly I wasn 't . I was playing dead . Then I cleared out . I went to Los Angeles . - No , I saw you dead . - But I 'm alive . Feel . You wanted to learn the secrets ? This is the best secret of all . You 're alive . ( Laughs ) I 'm alive . I came back , Angelo . I came back for you . Believe me , I have never done that before . I- - I even got us that same old room . You came back for me ? Yes . Yes I did . You don 't know whether to hit me or to kiss me , do you ? Come on , you can try both . ( Buttons clatter ) No scars . You keep learning . No . I don 't know what you are . I 'm Jack . That 's not the answer . It 's an answer . First of many . Come on . You 've been locked away for a year . I know you like this . I can feel that you like this . Grab my hand ! No ! ( Siren wailing ) ( Groans ) What the hell , Angelo ? What did you do ? Sei il diavolo ! I am not the devil . It 's the only way . The devil seduces with confidence . ( Grunts ) No . No ! Stay away from me , devil ! ( Groans ) ( Panting ) - ( Gasps ) - ( Screams ) ( Speaking Italian ) Jack . Il diavolo ! Ah ! I don 't understand . Angelo , I don 't understand . What did he do ? - We can show you . - E 'un miracolo . - Angelo : A miracle ? - Man : I want to see . Do it again . Tony . ( Speaks Italian ) Jack : No . No . ( Speaking Italian ) ( Gasps ) ( Shouting , clamoring ) Angelo . Angelo . No , don 't ! No ! - ( Gasps ) - ( Crowd clamoring ) - ( Gasps ) - ( Clamoring ) ( Screaming ) Man : I don 't know . I just don 't know what it is . Hmm . How much is the butcher asking ? $ 10,000 . Not too much for something with so much potential . And we 'd own him together ? A partnership . What do you say ? Agreed . Agreed . Agreed . This is it . It 's been a long time coming . All those years . What 's the most beautiful thing you 've ever seen ? Not just on Earth . I 'm not doing this . I 'm not giving final speeches . Just tell me , anywhere in the Universe . I saw a firebird once- - a tiny little thing , even smaller than a hummingbird . Oh yeah ? Literally made of fire . It only lives for a minute . It blazes different colors and sings . It gets so bright you have to close your eyes . And when you open them , it 's gone . Oh . But the image stays behind your eyelids for longer than it was alive . - Tell me another one . - I 've said enough . No , go on , tell me . Just tell me about your life , all the things that you 've never said . How many children did you have , Jack ? I 've lived a lot of lifetimes , Gwen . I can 't tell you everything . A lot of lifetimes . That 's a consolation , isn 't it ? Is it ? I mean you 've had more lives than anyone . It 's not enough . - I don 't want to die . - I know . I 'm so sorry , Jack . It just- - it went crazy like bloodlust . I was so scared . Aren 't you gonna take the wrist strap ? I 'm a good thief . I could have taken it any night . You 'd better clean up . We 've got to go . - Can you stand ? - Give me a minute . ( Groans ) I bought some inattention from Nico , the guy who 's supposed to be watching you , but it won 't last forever . You can put these on . Who were the three men ? - What men ? - There were three men . Like they were making an agreement . I don 't know . Hurry up . Angelo : Hurry , there 's a train out tonight . Train where ? Where are we going ? Like you said , we 'll go to the West Coast , Los Angeles together . Jack . Jack . Where are you going ? I left something here . You left something in a vent on a roof ? Ha , never go far without it . Okay , but now we go . I 'm going , yeah . Time to move on . But not with you . I 'm sorry . I was terrified , Jack . They said you were the devil , but other people said you were a blessing . Something happened to me once a long way away . Time itself changed me to a fixed point . And now I can 't die . I suffer and I perish , but I always come back . I 've lived through a lot of Earth 's past and a lot of its future . And I 'll keep on living this life forever . In the future , are we together ? - What does it matter ? - Are we together ? We can 't be 'cause one day you 're gonna die and I won 't . Then we forget the future . We make the moment now . We make a promise and we go forward . - Angelo , don 't . - What ? You 're lonely too . You said you want a companion . - Don 't make me do this . - You 're not going without me . - Just let me go . - But you can 't . I 'm never gonna let you go . I could travel this whole wide world , but where would I find another man like you ? Please , don 't leave me on my own . I 'm sorry , Angelo , but this is the story of my life . It always ends the same way . You kill me . Men like you ... you kill me . No ! No ! No ! No , Jack ! ( Panting ) - Know her ? - No . - Okay . - Woman : Thank you . You followed the instructions as far as I can tell . Captain Harkness , the last mortal man . It has been a long journey . - ( Gunshot ) - What the hell ? - Find out who that is . - It 's on you . Jack : Who is it ? What the hell are they doing ? - ( Rifle cocks ) - Gotcha . Bad day , Gwen ? ( Computer beeping ) - Rex . - Yeah ? Rex , you gotta see this . I was just checking the cache on the I-5s . Look what it says . - Rex : Can we track them ? - Yes . Oh , Gwen . - You ready ? - I 'm ready . Must be Rex and Esther . She 's still got Anwen . Not for long . Uh , you 've got a little something on you there . Now unless you want to be diagnosed category 1 ... Put your guns down . Okay , get back ! Get back ! Back ! - Her hands are up . - Yes . - ( Rings ) - Go go go . All right , go go go . - Grid one . Check him out . - One down . Living room clear . Spread out , follow the grid . Yes , sir . Jackson , with me . Rhys , I can 't believe it . We got you , don 't worry . - You 're all right . - Took your bloody time . Yes , hello , Mrs. Cooper . It 's been frantic . We got this call . I was off duty- - Gun gun gun ! Men : Shots fired ! I 've never shot anyone before . Where 's Gwen ? Andy , what 's happened to Gwen ? It 's okay . It 's okay . Your family and baby , they 're safe . - ( Exhales ) - Rex : Next time just ask for help . I 'm sick of Torchwood acting like amateur clowns . Oh , you did it ! Thank you ! Got it ? Thank you . And you , you 're gonna live . - It 's a talent of mine . - I meant every word I said . - So did I. - Good . And as for you , you 'd better pray that death comes back to this planet by the time I 'm finished with you . So tell us who you are before I let her loose . I don 't see that anything 's changed . You 're still coming with me . - Why would I do that ? - You 'll want to come with me . Because I can take you to the one man who knows how the miracle began . - Who 's that ? - Angelo . Angelo Colasanto . He 's waiting for you , Jack . He 's been waiting for such a very long time . ( Theme music playing ) = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

 Previously on Caprica ... No , Ben ! A group known as " Soldiers Of The One " is responsible for the bombing . We don 't really know the people closest to us . My daughter died in the bombing of train number 23 , but I think she may have caused it . My daughter was a terrorist ! I 'm just trying to find out who I am . I 'm Zoe , and the avatar , and the robot . Like some kind of what-you-call-it three-parter . Trinity . That 's what you are . I 've been given a mission that will change my life . I have someone for you to find- - Keon Gatwick . I need to know I can count on you to get me to Gemenon . I made a promise to Zoe before she died . I need to get something to Gemenon . I 'll see what I can do . Everything I 've built is on the line . People are so angry , they are throwing away their Graystone computers . Sarno 's making public opinion , and everyone in the 12 worlds is watching . Have Priyah book me on " Sarno " . Blood for blood . It 's the Tauron way . Daniel Graystone lost his daughter , right ? I lost my daughter and my wife . Balance it out . Hm - what 's going on ? Bomb in a holocafe three hours ago . Place was closed and empty . Okay , so not out to kill . Threat ? Or warning , or nuisance , or personal beef with the owner . Or STO . What ? You don 't come back after ten years just to blow up a train . No , they want us scared . Small bomb , middle of the night . My money 's on copycats . Yeah , well , if you got no STO worries , maybe you don 't want to hear about what I picked up at the courthouse . Don 't be coy . I hate that . What you got ? Intercolonial court on Libran handed that down an hour ago- - last matter of the day , Themis Standard Time . A search warrant for a private school ? How 'd you get this ? When Amanda Graystone held up that little infinity pendant at the memorial service , she handed us grounds to search Zoe 's property , Which includes the contents of her locker at school and any other locker she might have used . So you 're gonna call in the press , make a thing of it ? I might . Keep it tasteful . Good morning . Hi . Good morning . Am I , uh , too sweaty for you ? - Mm - mm . Ah , is that your phone ? Clarice Willow . Get off me . Get off me right now . Clarice , what 's going on ? Oh , I 'm so sorry . It 's my fault entirely . Global Defense Department ! Listen carefully , everybody ! I need you to step away from the lockers right now ! Everyone , now ! Step away ! Clear the hallway . Let 's go . Ladies . That 's it . Move . Move out . Come on , folks . That 's it . Toss everything . That 's it . Toss them all . Keon . Keon , we need to talk . I 'll walk away . You follow in a few . Next one . This is clear . This is a script . It 's a list of talking points . " I loved my daughter very much ... " - We only have a couple hours . - " but I knew she was troubled . " " There were disturbing signs well before I developed the Holoband technology . " All it needs are stage directions . Should I point to my heart ? Daniel , please . Look , we 're not telling you how to say it . - Use your own phrasing - Just what to say . Well , I don 't want to say she was troubled . - It 's important . - Why ? If she had a pre-existing problem , it takes the onus off the Holoband . Well , then I 'll--I 'll find a different way of saying it . She 's , uh , not happy I 'm going on " Sarno " . Exactly how not happy ? Not happy enough to make another announcement ? - No . - If she contradicts you- - She 'll be fine . You should probably play it a little guilty . You missed the warning signs . You 'll always blame yourself a little bit because of that . People want contrition . Just make it clear it 's not guilt for making a dangerous product . No , it had nothing to do with the Holoband . Well , that 's just true . That was great . Do that . I 'm a star . Can you say it all from the beginning again ? Yeah ? Why isn 't it done ? Because , so-fis-tace , they 're both in the house , and there 's two other people in there . How big a bloodbath do you want ? Right , no . Gods , uh , no bloodbath . You still want to do this , right ? Yes . Of course . Then have patience , Yoseef . This has all been very very upsetting . And I 'm--I 'm gonna make sure it doesn 't happen again . Now , everybody just go home . I 'll see you tomorrow . Go on . Are they gone ? Yeah , they went ahead to the studio . I need to get dressed . Do you know where the coat to this is ? I have no idea . That 's gonna strobe , anyway . Yeah , you 're right . I just can 't believe you 're going out there to dance on her grave like this . I 'm just saying the exact same thing that you said . I didn 't say she was crazy . She blew up a train . Maybe . You know , I don 't even know what she did . Maybe she was just running away . You think I want to do this ? I don 't want to do this , but I have to , because you opened up this little dialogue with greater Caprica . I didn 't mean to go on television . You are deliberately going on television . Sweetheart , there were cameras all over that park . I was just talking to the crowd . We just have to go with it , all right ? Does this- - does this tie work ? Yeah , it 's great . Okay . Look , can 't you just go out there and say that this is a very sad time for our family and that we need time to process- - - I wish , but- - but that just doesn 't play . The car should be here by now . Serge ! Doesn 't play ? Doesn 't play ? Did you actually hear what you just said ? I don 't have time for this right now , sweetheart . I 'm about to go on international television . We are not company spokespeople . - We 're parents ! - Parents ? Actually , no , we 're not . Can I help you , Daniel ? No . Oh , hell . Oh , hello , beautiful . How are you doing ? Me ? I 'm doing great . Thanks for asking . Well , so , yeah . They leave you down here all alone ? Yeah , yeah . Let 's take a closer look . You know , that is the finest work That I 've ever done , designing that . Mm-hmm . You need a name . I want to- - I want to go through it again . - Yeah , let 's run it . - One more time . - I still see the bruises . - I 'm doing my best . She was complicated . Long before I invented the Holoband- - " troubled " is better than " complicated . " " complicated " is meaningless . I shouldn 't have to say it in one word , anyway . It 's ridiculous . Zoe was ... Zoe 's troubles started a long time ago . How 's that ? " Zoe 's troubles " ? No , it 's not the same . " I loved Zoe . " What ? Yeah , uh , it 's a good place for you to start . " I loved Zoe , and I wish I 'd seen the signs , but it wasn 't the Holoband . " She was troubled . Give me a cigarette , Cyrus . You can 't smoke while I 'm working . Oh ... Rebecca , I am so sorry . I did not mean to offend you . But the idea of going on live television , quite frankly , makes me want to vomit . Is there anything I can do to help change your mind ? No . I 'll give you 1,000 cubits if you let me have a cigarette . Done . Thank you . Where were you ? You weren 't at school . They called . I was with Uncle Sam . It 's not a problem , is it ? I guess not . We won 't tell your father . On Tauron , when you 're 13 , you 're a man . You make your own decisions . Um , okay . Thank you , Tsattie . He barely sees you . He shouldn 't be angry when he does . What do you want to be , William ? I don 't know yet . I haven 't really thought about it . Huh . No ... Not when you grow up . What do you want to be now ? Well , there was this job for kids , where you work inside the locker rooms with the Pyramid players . Okay , be that . It 's just that Dad knows the owner , Mr. Graystone . - Uh - huh . I 'm not sure if they 're still friends . I 'm not sure if he still likes him . You think you only get things from friends ? You get the best things from enemies ... because they 're scared of you . Sam can look into it , okay ? Your uncle knows how to make things happen . Yoseef . - Sam . You 're the one who sent me to do this , you know ? You 're gonna have to be able to live with it . Just get it done . Well , keep your pants on . I 'm going in now . Wait a minute . What ? Wait ? Sam . Sam ! G.D.D. What ? Global agents . Okay , my guys , inside . Just give me a second . Everybody in ? Press , you got to stay outside ! - You can 't do this here . - Warrant . My--my husband does Defense work on these premises . The girl 's room is downstairs . Everybody wears gloves . Okay , the warrant only applies to the residence . We 're not gonna go anywhere near your husband 's lab , okay ? You 're gonna do this to her , I want to see this . I want to see this ! Doctor - - Doctor , please . Stay calm for a second . We 're not gonna do anything to her . We 're just trying to find out who turned her into a bomber . These two are already logged . Please , not her cello . She 's--she 's - at least please tell them to be careful with it . Careful with the cello . You really have to do this ? Really ? I mean , what do you think you 're gonna find here ? I really don 't know ... Maybe who she met with ... Who brainwashed her into believing in a moral dictator called God ... Maybe the name of some other kid who blew up a Caprican business in the middle of the night . I really don 't know . Do you honestly think that information 's here ? Really ? Jordan ... in the jewelry box . That wasn 't ... I put that there . That wasn 't here . There are loose ends , Doctor , and I 'm sorry if we have to take your daughter 's life apart in order to put other terrorists behind bars , but if we have to , then so be it . What is this to you ? Did you lose someone on that train ? I lost everyone on that train . And , um , I 'll see you later . Keon ... What are you doing here ? Last time I saw you , I had you pinned to the ground . You said you 'd help me get to Gemenon . Well , I was wrong . I can 't . You shouldn 't have scampered off during the locker search . It made you look guilty . You should go . I 'm the only one here today , and I have to have this bucket case fixed by the end of the afternoon , so ... What are you doing ? My mom does repairs , like , for a living . Well , what if someone sees us together ? Who 's seeing ? Nothing in Zoe Graystone 's room . No , the parents cleaned out the room . Look at the school . Yeah , nothing there either- - Minor drug stuff . You guaranteed me detonators and infinity symbols . Sir , it is too clean . Look , somebody got to those kids . Please , give me the power to access communications to the students- - E-sheets , phones . Gee , Scout leader Duram , this slope 's getting kind of slippery . Ben Stark and Zoe Graystone- - I guarantee you they are not the only students the STO turned at that school . Now , we find out who it was who warned those kids , we find out who it was who 's running the operation . You 're wrong about this , I own yoor-khayss . Tauron slang , that 's very street of you , sir . Fine . I 'm wrong , I 'll serve them to you on a plate . There . Well , that 's a nice-looking chest . I think it looks great . So let 's , uh- - Let 's check you out , shall we ? See that we didn 't glitch any connections . Running diagnostic test . Look at you . Huh ? I 'm gonna make you dance . All right ? Okay , here , here . Try this . Try this . Diagnostic test complete . Last of the e-sheets for today . Now , if we had an up-to-date computer ... All right , check around 6 : 00 A.M. It 's most likely a group-send to the entire student body . I 've never seen you like this . Yeah ? Well , we had Ben Stark , and we let him go . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm not putting this all on you . We all got complacent . We 're all responsible . Really ? So are we all responsible for the bad wheat crop on Aerilon ? Well , why are you doing it ? You 're still here . You 're working as hard as I am . Looks to me like Gemenese scum are luring good Caprican kids into a killer cult . Anyone doing that needs to be destroyed . Yeah . Oh , I got something for Willie . They 're like jacks , Since you threw out his fancy games . What are these , bones ? Well , Tauron children play jacks with the finger bones of the Tauron children who lose at jacks . That was a joke . They 're bones from chicken feet . Male announcer : The interview you thought you 'd never see . Daniel Graystone coming up at 10 : 00 on " Backtalk " with Baxter Sarno . Oh , that 's the man you don 't like . Yeah . Well ? It 's gonna be taken care of . Good . No , the dead don 't really die until their death is avenged . My daughter and your daughter are caught between life and death . He 's gonna pay . Good . Believe me . Hey , guys . Okay ! Welcome to " Backtalk " . Uh , thank you guys so much for coming out . We have got a pretty amazing show . I don 't need to tell you why , So let 's , uh ... let 's get through this horrible monologue that I wrote two minutes ago . Uh , not that things are perfect here on Caprica . Um , some of you know that , uh , many residents are not too happy with the government right now . They 're saying 30 seconds . Let 's go . They 're saying they are soft on terrorism . - Okay . - So in order to protest- - I see you guys laughing over there . Okay , here we go . - Daniel , they 're , uh - - they 're about to introduce you . Okay ! I just--I need a second ! Oh , my gosh , they broke our back . They sent us peppermint sticks . There 's nothing we can do . And finally , some of you may have heard , uh , yesterday security was called in here , Uh , but there 's nothing to worry about now . It turns out it was a huge misunderstanding . I was only bombing figuratively . Figuratively . Wow ! Yes . Fire half of the writing staff . Okay , on that grim note , let 's bring out our first guest . Uh , needs no introduction . Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Daniel Graystone . Ah , there he is . There he is . Cyrus , the global defense just came to the house . They ransacked the place . They 're doing this wrong . Daniel--there are things he has to say . Can we just talk about this later ? - It 's too late . He 's on . - So , Mr. Graystone , Thank you for coming on . Um , I think I-I may have mentioned you a couple of times this week . - I don 't know if you ... - Yes , you did . Yeah ? My solstice wish was for free publicity . Probably should have been a little more specific . I feel so much better about my monologue right now . All right , that 's ... I 'm sorry , listen , Um , this is ... this is what 's going on . - Is this water ? - Um , that , indeed , is water . Were you expecting ... was there something else - in your rider that you needed ? - No , I 'm fine with water . Can we get something stronger for , uh , Mr. Graystone ? We 're good ? - I 'm fine . Thank you . - Okay . Um ... Your wife , um , has stated that your daughter , uh , Zoe Graystone , was involved with terrorists and may have been ... may have been responsible for the bombing . We don 't know anything for sure , but , yes , it does seem that she 'd fallen in with this group , The Soldiers Of The One . She was ... She was , uh ... She was troubled , uh ... - Okay , let me just- - But this started a long time before I invented the Holoband . - Let me tell you what I see . - Troubled ? Let me just tell you what I see here . Uh , I see a lot of young people growing up in a virtual world right now . Yes , I 've--I 've actually heard your theory about this . I 've heard it before , and if I may . Let 's not talk theories , then . Let 's talk facts . - All right . - Facts--your daughter- - your troubled daughter , uh , growing up with , uh , Holobands and learning that there are no consequences , Absolutely . But ... He was right . It 's not a good word . It 's not a good word . You know it 's not a good word . But--but you see , the thing is , she didn 't even like the Holoband . - She didn 't like the Holoband ? - Not at all . - Hated it ? - Yes . Maybe because it was making her want to blow things up ? you know , and--and the whole ... No . Amanda ! Oh , wait . No , no , no , no . Um , ladies and gentlemen , uh , please welcome , uh , Dr. Amanda Graystone . Dr. Amanda Graystone , wow . Um , people watching at home , uh , let 's , uh , hit " record " , and we 'll be right back after these messages . This is going to be very exciting , so stick around . Okay , we are back . Uh , Dr. Graystone , this is a shock and a surprise . Yes . It 's a surprise for me too , But , um , I cou ... . I couldn 't stand there . I just had to . I-I ... You 're both getting this wrong . I 'm getting this wrong . Okay . I just flashed back to my first and third marriages there . I mean , um ... Okay , I 'm sorry . I don 't know why - I don 't know why I made a joke . Um , Dr. Graystone , uh , what is your take on this ? You 're out here saying that Zoe was crazy . Zoe wasn 't crazy . She wasn 't . Zoe was ... Zoe was angry . She was defiant . She was rude . She was frustrating . Okay . Well , show me a 15-year-old girl who isn 't . She slammed her door . She played loud music . She said that we embarrassed her in public . Slammed her door and played loud music , and blew up a commuter train . Well , when was I supposed to call the cops ? Well , I don 't know . Maybe when she started worshiping the big " Destruct-o " god in the sky maybe . We didn 't know . There weren 't any signs . You said she was troubled . She was angry . It 's a better word . My wife 's right . Okay , angry , but I 'd also like to add morally blank , Because the virtual world is a poor teacher and doesn 't teach you boundaries . You know who would completely agree with that is Zoe , and that 's exactly how the STO got to her . The ... okay , I 'm sorry , you have to slow down and back up and keep in mind half of this audience is stoned . Okay . Okay . She--she saw things in the virtual world ... ritual sacrifices , Games like New Cap City , And--and she felt the absence of moral guidelines , just like you do , like--like a lot of folks do . And--and into that absence steps the STO , offering this--this marvelous ultimate moral arbiter . It 's quite appealing , for a teenage girl , especially . You 're--you 're assuming all of this . No . No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? Uh ... After she died , I ... I created a virtual version of her , an avatar . You cre--I 'm sorry . You- - you made an electronic ghost of your dead daughter . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . I sympathize . I sympathize . This--this is very disturbing . Yes . Yes , it is disturbing . But--but show me a parent who would not do anything possible to--to try and understand their child . - Okay , well ... - It was disturbing . I know that . Hey . But I was trying to make sense ... You got a bracelet ? There 's a plastic bracelet for backstage visitors . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that , And I know she wasn 't real , but ... But I could use that I.D. Badge . I used the tools , the gifts that I have to do that ... But it did offer some small insight Into her motivations . If--if this whole thing was a reaction to the V-World , Then we 're just right back At square one , though , aren 't we ? Isn 't technology the problem ? I mean , isn 't - - isn 't the V-World the problem ? - No , that 's not the problem . - Maybe . - I 'm sorry . Maybe ? - Maybe . Okay , I 'm starting to like you , Mr. Graystone . We thought we could control the content in V-World , especially for kids , but we 've failed , clearly . I think the temptation to hack the code is too great . All right , well , then what is your solution ? - I don 't know . - Well , t-think out loud . I don 't know . I ... for there to be any ... any beneficial change , you 'd have to ... to take away the profit motive , Like when they legalized drugs , for instance . Okay , well , that 's a good point , but you 're also talking about something that took decades of some pretty violent arguing back and forth- - Well , you know , why not ? Why couldn 't we ... why couldn 't we try it ? But this is a huge leap you 're talking about . No , Graystone Industries will no longer charge for licensing of any legal spaces , and--and any profit we make off the bands will go to some charity or- - a foundation that we can create . We 'll create something for young people to find the right experiences and the right values . Okay , this is ... you 're saying this now , and--and I support it . I think this is very admirable . Are you gonna say this Monday to your stockholders and your board of directors ? Great P.R. No , that 's great P.R. - Yes , I can promise this . - That 's 60 % of our net . My company will make no more profit on the Holobands or V-World licensing . Hold me to it , Caprica . Okay , well , uh , speaking for Caprica , and you know that I like to , uh , we will . Wow . Uh , thank you , Doctors Graystone . This was a fascinating , uh , discussion that I was completely unprepared for . Uh , thank you very much , And I think we need to credit Amanda with the most amazing save - since Bracken Oka ... - She 's on there ? She 's not supposed to be . Let 's pick an analogy where the Bucs won , okay ? - Okay , I don 't let my - - I could kill her with my own hands ... Sleep well every night . Couldn 't you ? I see a lot of panicked faces behind me . - This might take a while . - Don 't say that . You should probably go on home . All right , well , I got a taxi , so ... I can get you a car . I can get another one . I 'll see you at home . - Okay . - Love you . - Thanks again . - Yeah . Excuse me . Uh , sorry . I 'm , uh , Baxter 's driver . If you like , I could take you home . Yeah , perfect . Thank you . What 's your name ? I 'm Sam . Nice to meet you . I 'm Amanda . Nice to meet you . ♫ I 'm just a man ♫ ♫ I 'm a man ♫ ♫ who loves a woman ♫ ♫ She does me cold ♫ ♫ She does me wrong ♫ ♫ She does me cruel ♫ You saved my life with this one . So , um , did you have something in your locker ? Did you get a warning ? I can 't tell you . I-I can 't . I just can 't . I get why you 're being cautious . That 's smart . But I have to do this . I have to go to Gemenon and take Zoe 's package with me . I have to . If there 's any way you can help me ... Uh ... I can maybe set up a meeting with Barnabas . That 's all I can do . He 's the one who can decide if you get the STO 's help . Yes . Thank you . ♫ I play the fool ♫ ♫ oh , when I get up ... ♫ Are those homemade ? I 'm sorry , what ? Your tattoos , are they homemade ? I 'm sorry . I don 't mean to pry , but I 'm a plastic surgeon . I 'm really interested in that sort of thing . They 're cultural ... Tauron . Oh , yes , of course . They have meanings , right ? Yeah . A lot of people here on Caprica think they mean that you 're a gangster , but they don 't . Of course not . Well , I mean , it might , but ... it doesn 't have to . You know , you get ink because you 're a parent , or you got a fancy pedigree , Or there 's some sort of ritual , maybe made a mistake . I could give you a fancy pedigree . I could ... add a few accomplishments , take away a few mistakes . Yeah , well , that wouldn 't be real , I 'm afraid . Very little is real these days . This isn 't the way home . Come on , Sam . " Don 't . " Larry , hi . Um , listen , I-I need to get a hold of Sam . And it 's an emergency , and it 's ... he won 't answer his phone . Please . Have him call me soon as you hear from him , okay ? Thanks . Turn on your frakkin ' phone ! ♫ She does me cold ♫ Excuse me , this isn 't the way home . Yeah , there was an accident on the thruway . I 'm just gonna cut through little Tauron . Don 't worry . It 's good people here . Not very nosy ... which is a good thing , right ? What with all those people angry about all those deaths . I lost my sister-in-law and my niece on that train . My gods , I 'm so sorry . Yeah . Well , you can 't turn back time . Nothing I could do to change that now . Yeah . I guess all we can try and do is understand . Or look for some kind of balance . Maybe try to even things out . My sister-in-law 's name was Shannon . My niece was named Tamara . She was gonna make us all proud . Sam . Hey . Larry hates it when I come home bloody . Did you do it ? Can 't hear you over the water . Is it done ? Yeah , it 's done . Why you think I 'm washing up , huh ? She was getting a little , uh ... A-po-play-ktay in the car . Didn 't want a fight in a closed space , so I ordered her out of the car . Said we were having engine trouble , she should go inside this restaurant . Connie 's Place , remember ? We used to go there in high school . - I know Connie 's Place . - Yeah . I sent her inside , right ? Jacks . Nice . And , uh , she notices right away that there 's no one inside , 'cause I called ahead just in case . So I 'm standing in the front With the knives , tsfa-gi-dess . - Yeah . - Frak . She tries to get out back to the alley , but it 's locked . You killed her in the kitchen ? Well , that stuff they spray at crime scenes can 't tell the difference between animal blood and human blood . You really did it . No , I 'm messin ' with you to teach you a lesson about yanking me around like this . Wait . What ? - Hmm ? - Are you ... Was that sarcastic ? What do you think ? I can 't tell , Sam ! Stop frakkin ' around ! Did you kill her ? I don 't turn off my phone , Yoseef , and I got other people who call me , you know ? So , yeah ... I got your , like , 60 text messages . I didn 't kill her . Scared her a bit . Bet she 's getting a lot of that right now . You 're frakkin ' with me . Oh , yeah , I 'm frakkin ' with you , 'cause I knew you couldn 't go through with it . Frakkin ' Caprican in a Tauron body . Nah . Hmm ? No , I talked to her . You did ? When ? Again ? Weren 't you , uh , watching this earlier ? After she died , I ... I created a virtual version of her , an avatar . Yeah , well , I like it . Seems like every time this family 's on TV , I get so much out of it . I just wanted to hear the sound of her voice again . Feeling better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . I guess people are just ... really scared and angry right now . I don 't blame them . I think from now on , we--we both need to be a little more careful . So you made an avatar of Zoe . It was nothing . You know how it works . It 's just a picture of her , nothing more . Yeah . I know how an avatar works , and so do you . Why did you do it ? Why didn 't you tell me ? I didn 't know it got that bad . I mean ... You could have talked to me . I know . I just ... I miss her . You know ? Yeah , I know . I just miss her . I miss her too . I really ... I really do . Want to watch TV ? Graystones are on " Sarno " tonight . I heard they were really good . I am so sick of them . They 're everywhere . - Oh , awful . - Rich . - disgusting . - Ridiculous people . Hmm ...

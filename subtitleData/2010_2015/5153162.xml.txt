So you think we can just kill this man - and solve the problem . - Yeah . I want to show our friends something . It 's still on the Fritz . I don 't know if that 's a good idea . And there she goes . Oh ... I got it . Let 's just hope NASA finally got the servers upgraded like I asked . So what exactly is this , Dr. Bryce ? It 's called a panopticon .

Bring up a city that 's been thriving in the last 50 years . - How ' bout Tokyo ? - Perfect . Mr. Malcolm , I assume you know how Tokyo looks in present day ? Charlie 's gonna show you a version of Tokyo if Benjamin Rourke were never born . Wow . Rourke was a nobel prize - winning physicist . His work in particle physics played a major part in fostering the modern age . Which means if you take him out of the equation , all of that is erased . No Sony , no Toyota . More world hunger , disease . Millions of lives irreversibly damaged without anyone ever having a say . So this thing can test the effect of any changes we make in the past . Within a pretty damn high rate of probability , yeah . I 'm sorry , doctor , but at what point was this a mission to save Tokyo ? Our mission is to restore everything to the way it was . Don 't you understand ? All of these events are tied together . You don 't have the right to change 20 million lives . - Are they any better ideas ? - Maybe we can just go into the past and send a message forward , like warn that New York is gonna happen ? Charlie , we 've already discussed this , it 's too risky . We can 't just assume that people would believe us . She 's so beautiful . Show me present day New York if Rourke 's wife is still alive . Born Sylvia Hammond , 1945 . She met Rourke at M.I.T. in 1964 . In 1975 , she was killed by a mugger in Georgetown . Yeah , yeah . I already have all that . Uh , so this ... Is present-day New York . And this is present day ... if Rourke 's wife were still alive . [ Click ] It worked . Yeah . High probability that if Rourke 's wife wasn 't killed , we save New York . Mr. Knox , how did you know that ? Rourke told me . He said I was gonna bring back his wife . Man : I was told you were the man to talk to . Okay . Our focus here is Sylvia Rourke . We need to know everything about how she died . The key is , we can 't have any other ripples . We only impact what we need to impact , so let 's figure this out . [ Jazz music playing ] Dr. Bryce said you were working on some sort of a comm system , a way to talk between the past and the present ? Mmhmm . - Is that it ? - Mm-hmm . This sends a high-band frequency through the medium ... Polycarbon with a degrading half-life . How , exactly , does that work ? Well , nothing we send into the past can be left behind . It creates bad ripples . And we don 't like bad ripples . No , we don 't like bad ripples . Let 's say one of you guys forgets a precious and very expensive piece of my technology . With my remote , I can just ... [ Warbling tone ] [ Chuckles ] Wow . You came up with all this ? I did . [ Chuckles ] - So you used to work at NASA . - Uhhuh . So what brings you here , man ? I mean , this must seem kind of like a step back after outer space , right ? You know , I asked Dr. Bryce that very same question when she first came to me . I said , " we 've been to outer space " and we 've been to the bottom of the sea . Where else is left for man to go ? " You know what she said to me ? What 's that ? [ Jazz music playing ] Backwards . Leaving already ? The president wants me back in Washington . You know , real world problems . Rourke knew about this program , didn 't he ? May we have a minute ? Rourke had no reason to do what he did unless he knew this program existed . [ Sighs ] Look , Rourke was one of the finest minds this country has ever produced . Is it possible through the process of vetting Bryce 's numbers that something could have crossed his desk ? Absolutely . I 've thought about it too . It 's a concern . But Sean , do you know why I brought you in ? You 've got a lot of enemies where that interrogation is concerned . A lot of people think they could have broken Rourke if it wasn 't for you . But I watched that tape , and I happen to think you were right . Rourke was never gonna give up that code . All he wanted was to be heard . And that 's how you 're gonna turn this around . So this is probably the last I 'll remember . Bryce says there 's a distortion field coming from the window that protects this place from changes in time . - So if we 're successful ... - You 'll be the only ones who know the present was ever different . Probably better that way . What 's to remember , right ? Good luck , Knox . If we ever see each other again , give me a wink or something , even if I don 't know what it means . - Certain , or 88 % certain ? - Certain . Then we 're good to go . Oh , good . I think we 've got something that we can work with . Okay . Tell me what you got . Guys , take ' em through Sylvia Rourke . Right , so in June , 1969 , Benjamin Rourke marries Sylvia . Daughter of a Florida senator . Happily married for six years . Then we come to 1975 , when Sylvia is shot and killed in a mugging gone wrong . Based on Rourke 's journals , it 's the beginning of his decent into madness . Which is the inflection point we 're trying to change . Our goal is to reroute history around her death without changing anything else . Which is a bitch , 'cause we 're not in 1975 . We were considering letting this window go until we found this . Mary , bring up the mug shot . This is Ronald Marsden , the man who murdered Rourke 's wife . He was a vagrant , drifted through halfway houses most of his life . He was 65 when he killed her , and when he was arrested , he confessed to a string of robberies going all the way back to the 1920s . Which gives us exactly where he 's going to be tonight . Or , rather , I should say , six hours from now at 9 : 07 P.M. , on March 8 , 1929 . He 's robbing a jewelry store in Beacon County . Tonight ? Yeah , he was standing lookout . Cops arrive eight minutes after his buddies break in , shots fired , two guys get killed . So we 're assuming Marsden got away . Mmhmm , ' cause we don 't have his whereabouts once the police arrive . That means you need to get there before the police arrive . Beacon 's only 40 miles away from the Mall . Plenty of time to lift a car , get there , do what we gotta do . Here 's a better photo , an earlier mug shot . And here 's the best part . Marsden 's got a low impact index . Means based on what we know , there 's only , like , a 17 % probability that killing him in 1929 will have any unwanted side effects . So we kill this man , save Rourke 's wife , bring back New York ? Exactly . You comfortable with that ? It saves 9 million lives . All right . Then we 're a go . If a situation is messed up , you don 't say it 's messed up . You say it 's off its nuts . If you see a drunk , he 's not a drunk . He 's got an edge . Your girlfriend is a Sheba . Your boyfriend is a Sheik ... Hey , hey , hey . How ' bout we just don 't talk to anybody in the past ? That 's probably a better idea . Yes , definitely .

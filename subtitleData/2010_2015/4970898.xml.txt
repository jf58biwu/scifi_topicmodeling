You 've seen their commercials ? No . I-I know them from ... wait . They have a commercial ? Here you go , boys . And they get paid ? I 'm seriously going about this job the wrong way . ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Psst ! Psst ! Action ! Aah ! It 's an evo ! Down , you ! Has this ever happened to you ? Hi . - We 're Rombauer and Lansky ... - The evo guys . When your favorite fern goes evo , you can forget about Providence . They only have time for the big stuff . So call us instead . We are two Providence-trained evo-abatement experts . I called the evo guys , and just look what they did . Your evo problem isn 't too small for us , and our prices aren 't too big for you . Serving all of Brooklyn . Except Canarsie . I can 't go to Canarsie . Long story . So , if you 've got an evo in your home , your boat , your R.V ... or your boat . ... just call Rombauer and Lansky . We do the jobs that Providence won 't do . We 're here 24 / 7 to help you . But don 't call on weekends or before noon . So , you 're telling me we can afford dozens of humongo screens in this room alone , but we don 't have our own commercial . We don 't have a commercial , though , do we ? I mean , if we did , I 'd be starring in it , right ? This is no joke . Even small evos can be dangerous if not handled properly . Providence can 't stop them all . These boys want to pitch in , fine by me . ¿ Por qué , Carmen ? ¿ Por qué ? Raah ! No , no . Holiday 's right . I should check these guys out . Thanks , but I 'm sure you have better things to do . Never too busy to look into something that concerns you . Me cacheteas como mi madre me besaba mis cachetes . I 'm not concerned . Can 't hear you . Already out the door . Right after I see what Carmen says to Isabella . Or I could just go now . So , once we 're done catching the evo in your basement , uh , if there 's anything else you 'd like me to ... look into ... Just call the 800 number . We offer a discount for repeat customers . What was that ? ! I won 't bore you with the technical term . Trust me ... what you 're hearing is a normal part of the help ! Hang on , Lansky ! Yeah ? Well , you 'll be singing a different tune when you see what 's in our ... bag of tricks . Was I supposed to bring that ? Aaaaaah ! Rex ! What 's Providence doing here ? We got this evo in the bag . I figured that from the way you came flying out that window . Yeah , well , you got your methods ... we got ours . And this is our case . Wait . I just want to talk to you guys . Oh . You mean Providence needs to consult with us ? Why didn 't you say so ? So , last time I saw you guys ... You can say it . I washed out of the training academy . And he quit Providence after one week on the job . We 're not ashamed of that anymore . I mean , look at us now . Ow ! Hey , help us catch this thing , and then we can talk . One cured evo coming up . Ugh ! He 's incurable . This may get tricky . Aaaaaah ! Uh ... I think it got away . Great ! The job was to get it out of the basement , and we did . That 's right . There 's no evo we can 't beat . For a very reasonable rate . What did you do to my house ? ! That was my bad . I took it out of your fee . Huh ? It 's for 50 bucks . Oh , I don 't believe it ! 50 bucks ! Ouch ! Hey , look at this . That 's weird . Now it 's purple and rock-solid . Let 's get a sample . This could be important . Important to who ? We already got paid for this job . A lot . Can I get one more picture ? Only if you get Rex in it . He 's really the one to thank for what we did here today . Tell all your friends you shook hands with the newest member of the evo guys . Uh , I appreciate the offer , guys , but I 've already got a job . Exactly . You 've got a j-o-b . We 're offering you the chance to get in on the ground floor of your own business ... With all the perks . Give each of those ladies an extra pickle on our tab . And while you 're at it , get one for yourself . You 're Providence 's number-one guy , and what do you have to show for it ? What 's the limit on your credit card ? How much you got in your bank account ? Hard to say , since I don 't have any of those things . Oh ! Look , we can offer you a lot more than money . Take a look at this . Me and Lansky are on the menu . The RL ... the roast beef and lettuce . I 'm the meat in my own sandwich . And I 'm the lettuce . And with you , we could be even bigger . We could expand to Staten Island , maybe even New Jersey . Oh ! I can 't go to Jersey . It 's a long story . Point is ... we could really make something of ourselves . And did I mention working for yourself means no boss checking up on you . Look , Providence has done a lot for me ... maybe not money or sandwiches , but I 'm important there . Rex , when you get back , I need you in the zoo . The auto feeder flooded it with monkey chow ... again . I 'm sorry . You were saying ? Look , I 'm not asking you to quit Providence . Just moonlight on the side with us , see what it 's like to be your own boss . I 'm in . Okay . We 'll give you a tryout . But I got to warn you ... out here on the streets of Brooklyn , we fight evos our own way . ♪ This is my song ♪ Shotgun ! ♪ Won 't last too long ♪ ♪ and now it 's on ♪ Aah ! Help ! Aah ! Whoo-hoo ! Whoo-hoo ! We do the jobs Providence won 't . And now se habla Español . Shotgun ! Now he 's the meat in my sandwich ? Neighbor called in a poodle that 's leaving evo-sized messes on his lawn . Okay , I-I see the dog , but where 's the ... Ooh ! Let me and Lansky handle this one . Really ? Yeah , really . Oh ! Aah ! Oh ! It was a pleasure working with youse . Hey ! It 's that thing again . And it looks like it 's ... Really , really gross . Aah ! Okay , that 's it . I 'm calling this in . Or not . It 's got my communicator . We have to stop it . Unh-unh . We have to help our clients , and right now , there 's an evo parrot in park slope telling some really nasty " yo mama " jokes . This is serious . Oh , so now you 're too good for the work we do ? Well , that 's fine , ' cause we were better off without you . What ? ! Your business is booming thanks to me . Exactly ... my business ! I mean , our business ... mine and Lansky 's . And then you show up . First , you steal our thunder , and now you 're telling us what to do ? If we wanted to be a couple of nobodies getting bossed around , we 'd go back to Providence . Yeah ! Except Providence said they 'd never take us back . We don 't have time for this right now . He 's right . Who knows what that parrot 's saying . Could be children around . Come on , Lansky . Aah ! You had to be the hero . Aah ! Whoa . Problema . Give me that ! Rex : This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it 's gonna hurt you . Aaaaah ! Aah ! Thank you . Oh . So it 's up to you to keep all this going . Problem solved . Guess I need a plan " b . " Rex to Providence . There 's a funky foot fungus eating Brooklyn . We noticed . That kind of thing tends to get our attention . Six , did you get it ? Nothing . No effect . Oh , come on ! At least I was able to hurt it . Whoa ! Okay , was able to hurt it . Rex , I 've been monitoring your conversation , as well as analyzing data streaming in from agents on the ground . Thanks for catching me up on your day . But how do we kill this stuff ? It appears that once the fungus hits sunlight , it aero-oxidizes and becomes nearly indestructible . But what 's down in the tunnels hasn 't been exposed to the sun . That 's why it 's still green and vulnerable . There 's a chance it can be taken out from your location . That 's supposed to be good news ? Yes . Here 's the bad . There 's a layer of oxidized fungus between you and the rest of us . You 're gonna have to do this alone . I 'm not alone . Let 's get one thing straight . We 're not here to save the day . We only care about our company . And you 're part of our company . Also , when we came back down here , we couldn 't get out when we changed our mind . Okay , that too . But mostly what I said . I appreciate it , but ... Look out ! Whoa ! We got to stop that thing from making more of that stuff . But it 's really smart . That 's not gonna matter this time , because this time , you 're gonna have to face our ... Bag of tricks . Don 't tell me . I thought you were gonna pack it in ... I said don 't tell me ! Incoming ! Rombauer . Aah ! Where 'd it get you ? Your heart ? Worse . My wallet . Rex : Wonderful . Aah ! Aah ! Forget it . We can 't do this . Sucker ! You really thought we 'd just give up ? We 're not the same guys who quit on Providence . Yeah . We 're businessmen now . And letting you destroy Brooklyn ? That is definitely bad for business . Rex : Hmm . The fungus has stopped growing . It 's breaking apart . Looks like teaming up with you wasn 't such a bad idea after all . We 've got a level 2 event outside Duluth . Mount up . If you want to make it permanent , I bet I can talk Providence into taking you back . We 'll pass . You got your job to do , and we got ours . But if you ever need us ... Just call the evo guys . Now serving all of Brooklyn and Staten Island . Except Canarsie . We 're here ... Oh , sorry . Go ahead , you . We 're here 24 / 7 to help you . Not available before noon or on weekends . We no longer habla Español .

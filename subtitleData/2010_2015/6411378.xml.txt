 Charles , what are you doing out here ? Just chasing wolves . I think canyons is the best place to hunt . - Canyons ? What are you saying ? - Doesn 't matter . We just built the most significant corporation in the world , and you just walked away . Charles , I won 't change my decision . Okay . Where 's the device ? You don 't see how dangerous the Phantom is or the consequences . Well , we built it , we created it , and we agreed upon it . Now this needs to be done . Humanity is being destroyed by terrorism . Now , you eliminate the GS code , it 's a disaster . I was wrong . We were wrong . And the world doesn 't deserve this . Hyah ! Hyah ! Hyah ! Due to the prevalence of high crime rates all over the world , urgent action was needed . To address the crisis , Global Security Corporation developed a promising ID technology that over time , was capable of eliminating crime and stabilizing societies . Given the effectiveness of this GS code , international laws were quickly drafted , requiring it for every populace . 95 % of the Earth 's population was imprinted with it , on a voluntary basis . Global Security Corporation 's unified international system collects information on all GS code recipients and makes it possible for law enforcement agencies to track citizens on demand . As such , the widespread adoption of the technology resulted in an 84.7 % decrease in crime around the world . Revenues generated by GS coding and its related businesses are conservatively estimated to exceed hundreds of billions of dollars , making Global Security the wealthiest corporation on the planet . However , being under constant surveillance is reportedly causing unforeseen consequences as GS code recipients are suffering psychological side effects . Side effects that could be affecting as much as 41 % of the world 's population . No . What we know is humanity is being plagued by relentless terrorism . Eliminating the GS coding system is out of the question , without grave ramifications . Irreparable ones . Today , all human rights groups oppose GS coding . Citizens around the world have been staging mass protests , petitioning their governments to abolish laws and programs associated with Global Security . In response to the global pressure , world leaders plan to vote in an online summit on the continued use of GS code technology . We 're on location at a business center , where a very serious situation is currently unfolding . Details are still forthcoming , but what we can report is that an unidentified group of terrorists ... We have a point of entry . In an unprecedented move , terrorists have taken over the entire structure , though their reasons for doing so are not known . Where the hell were you ? What 's all this ? We 've got a crisis here . I 'm sorry . What 's the situation ? Take these . They 've got hostages . This is the layout . Early reports say there 's about 20 to 30 hostages in there . No terrorist count as of yet . Titticoff 's here , right ? Yeah , he 's going in . Okay , I got it . You know ... there are about five liters of blood in the human body . And this bomb only needs one ... to wipe out this whole office . Got it ? Boss , we 've got company . Move it ! I 've been authorized by the city to negotiate the release of the hostages . What exactly are your terms ? My terms . Plato , it 's a trap . They killed one of our guys . You wanna play , huh ? Well , let 's play then . Swallow it ! You 'll follow my rules though . Don 't move ! Titticoff . See them ? They have roughly 50 armed men inside there . This isn 't terrorism . And when I asked for their terms , they didn 't make any demands at all . It 's some kind of heist . They forced me to swallow something too . You should get yourself looked at . I want a fully loaded chopper . And don 't try to stop us . No funny business . If anything goes wrong , you 're gonna have 35 corpses on your hands , and it 's your conscience . I won 't wait long . You 'd better think quickly . We can 't risk more casualties . Our course of action must minimize that . Plan A , a ground assault . Yes , sir . And Plan B , an air assault . Understood . Play along , for now . Timur , this is delicate . It 'll be risky , but we need eyes on targets . - Understood ? - Yes , General . I 'll leave right now . Plato , I told you . I need the CFO to get inside the vault . - Let me go ! - Shut up and walk ! Hey ! I don 't like this . So how much longer ? You promised no one would get hurt . Don 't sweat it . Forget the hostages . The most important thing is that I love you . How about you , Zack ? You know I 'd do anything for you . That 's better . No problem . Up . Make it fast . Jackpot , guys . Come on . Are we leaving ? Not till Plato says so . He was in this office , last I heard . Interesting stuff . I didn 't know he liked ethnography . Smart . What 's that ? I adore you . Don 't you trust me ? We 're gonna save the world . Believe that . Meet me on the roof . And tell Plato . Come on ! And we 've got eyes . Erlan had the blocker all this time . Plato , the swallow has landed . Start loading up . Three little voices , I 've heard . Where 's Rush ? You 're asking me ? What about them ? You 'll see once we take off . Don 't do this . We got the stuff . Huh ? Amateur . Little late for a conscience . Clear the building . Repeat . Clear the building . End of the line . No ! It 's time to go . It 's a bomb . Not my area . Hey ! You 're gonna have to catch the next flight . Get lost , bastard ! Get a move on ! Take off ! What the fuck ? ! Going somewhere ? Yeah . Stay back . Stay right there or I 'll shoot ! Why don 't you let the girl go ? She 's got nothing to do with this . No one has to die . I 'm with you . So let me go , and she stays alive , understand ? Quit crying ! Okay . Just put the gun down . Nice and slow . Are you hurt ? The EMTs ... are out front . Will you be okay ? Hey , watch it ! What 's next ? Hold on . Get me HQ . No GS code , so use prints . Zack , there are a few things here we need to clear up . Why don 't you have a GS code ? I 'm a citizen of the world . An expert hacker getting involved in a heist . It 's kind of hard to swallow . You 'd earn more sitting in front of a computer in Miami . And in just a few keystrokes . What 's your plan ? I call it extreme hacking . I 'm looking for a new groove . Who hired you ? I ... I don 't know . The sensors indicate he 's lying . Understood . I need files on every single hostage from the Business Center and video from every surveillance camera . You 're a crook , a loser . If it was me , I 'd just execute you all on live TV . We 're trying to improve the world . - Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty . - You said we . Who else is with you ? Who ordered this ? You 're gonna talk one way or the other , got it ? Mom , I 'm scared . I don 't want to lose you . Don 't worry , baby . I 'll always be with you . I 'll always be with you . You still have it . Yeah . Ever since she died . It reminds me of her . Timur , you can 't live in the past . Everyone I love , they all leave , go away . You should stop blaming yourself . It 's not your fault . She 'd still be alive , if not for me . Keira ... I want to show you something over here . Close your eyes . Go on . Don 't peek . They 're closed . One sec . Ready ? I 've wanted to ask you ... that is ... Will you ... Not turtledoves . Lovers . Keira . What 's wrong ? Timur . Let 's go . It 's a necessary system function . We never use it . Her data 's been processed and sent to base . Do you know this guy ? No . Take another look . You really don 't ? No . This is Charles Ingrim . A renowned scientist from Britain . He happened to be here in Kazakhstan to attend a science conference . Keira , why 'd you try to kill him ? I don 't know . I wouldn 't . No , Keira , you did . You tried to kill him , didn 't you ? ! Strange . According to the sensors , she 's telling the truth . You tried to kill him ! Admit it ! - I didn 't . - Why did you go after Charles Ingrim ? - I didn 't ! - It 's clear you did . Why , Keira ? What was your reason ? I had none . You tried to kill him ! You had to have reason ! I 'm not a killer ! Okay . Settle down . All right . It was you and Timur . There wasn 't anyone else close enough to do it . So who else could 've cut that line ? Not me . Not me . Was it Timur ? Timur wouldn 't . They think I 'm crazy . A killer . Why ? Why is this happening to me ? Calm down now . Timur sent me . You can trust me . I 'm a psychologist . Please . I don 't know . I 'll help you . What happened ? Tell me about that day , the details of what occurred . All I know is that I had the strangest feeling , a sort of overwhelming urge . Something like that . I don 't remember exactly . Let me try to help you . Timur , we need to talk . Come to my place . It 's important . On my way . Easy , now . No ! No ! Keira , what have you done ? Don 't move ! Keira 's innocent . Someone 's setting her up . I 'm starting to believe in Keira 's innocence . Who 's this ? It 's one of the hostages . What about this ? And this ? I don 't know . Timur , you let one of the criminals get away . Look . Anyone who sees this is gonna say you 're helping your lover escape . I don 't know her . The evidence says otherwise , Timur . It 's aiding and abetting . And now the murder of your psychologist . You 're a dead man . Marah , please . It 's not what it looks like . I don 't believe you . - Over there . - Okay . I need a way to find this woman . See if you can get me something on her . What do you got ? I can 't find any information on this case anywhere on the database . No hits . Your orders are to keep everyone out . Hold on . Call for help . - Have you missed me ? - No . It 's been so lonely . Stay the hell away from me . - Can 't you just stay away ? - Calm down , Charlie . Just calm down . Where is it ? - What were you doing in the mountains ? - You don 't have it ? You 're better off . We 're all better off . All of this was your genius idea , remember ? But ... I 'll do it my way . I deserve it more . It 's good you got rid of Erlan . You did me a favor . By the way , Zack 's a better lover . You 'll get nothing from me . You hear me ? You won 't get shit from me . - You 'll get nothing . - If you don 't have it ... - You 'll get nothing . - Zack does . You 'll get nothing . We have reports of an increasing number of protests as well as organized work stoppage . The company that has been most affected by both the market drop and the ongoing protests Timur has confessed . You 're free to go . No , it 's not him . - He never - I said go ! We found her . Rush , what now ? Connect it to Timur 's GS code . Find him . Life is full of surprises , huh ? Crazy . Don 't you think ? It 's for you . Timur , break Zack out of prison and deliver him to Quadrant X , or Keira dies . Know him ? The dude 's a cop . He busted me . That 's it ? That 's it . No , he told me something . He said that I ought to refuse a crime reenactment . Here . This is where we all split the money . Money ? I didn 't take any . Then we went upstairs . Let 's go . And here . Here . We stopped and went up . We weren 't here . Then where were you ? And here ... we run for it ! Hey ! Stop ! Wait ! Warn me next time . I didn 't expect to actually get you to help me . Move it now ! This is nuts . To think a cop actually broke me out of jail . Your people forced me to do it ! They took my girlfriend for leverage ! Get it ? I didn 't know . Right . Like you 're any different . Screw you ! Run ! Hold it ! There ! Goal ! Watch it ! Stop ! Hey ! Stop . Send its coordinates to the patrol . Intercept them . Sending data . Get the door ! Nice . You 'd make a great car thief . Get in . Hurry up ! Gun it . Block all the exits ! Faster ! Dammit , we missed it ! Move it ! What are you doing ? Come on ! The roads have been blocked . We 're gonna have to get out of here . How ? Hang on . We 're totally screwed ! Come on ! Stop the car ! Brakes are shot . I 'll always be with you . Always . I can 't believe I swam out of a sinking car just to save the life of a cop . Relax , man . Can 't swim , tough guy ? How about a thank-you ? We should be safe for now . You could 've left me in there . Why 'd you pull me out of the car ? So we have to get to Quadrant X. That won 't be easy in these prison clothes or with that GS code in your eye . We can 't help that . Maybe you can 't . You don 't know Jackie . Who 's Jackie ? You have just accessed the Interpol Database , case file 32ZX . 16 serial murders were committed across multiple countries . They occurred in short succession . A different person was arrested each time . The only link is that each of the perpetrators lacked a motive and retained no memory of their actions . You see this ? Yeah . It 's really awful . None of them were even aware they were killing others . It sounds unbelievable . It doesn 't make sense . There is one clue though . The victims were scientists . One worked for Global Security . His name was Erlan . I think he was one ofbthe higher-ups there . As I recall ... I heard he broke his contract and flew the coop . Only to be killed . Charles Ingrim was attacked shortly after . It 's linked . And I don 't know how . They could 've pissed off the wrong person . Maybe they were in someone 's way or knew something they shouldn 't have . Maybe . Come on . We need to have a word with Charles Ingrim . Marah . Yeah ? The divers are done . No bodies were found . He 's alive . Connect to Timur 's GS code . Uh-huh . Quickly . What is this ? You hack the system , Jackie ? Yeah . The police are getting cozy with the black hole , man . Damn ! Get the word out . What are you looking at ? Quit staring ! Charles Ingrim at the Central Hospital in serious condition . Zack . Wait . Hey ! Get back here ! What the hell is with you ? Zack ! - Look out ! - Are you crazy ? Hey ! Dad ! It 's me ! Dad ! Dad ? Thank God you 're alive . Thank God . - Listen to me . - Dad . You gotta stay clear of Rush . She 's using you . - What are you saying ? - She 's using you . Rush ? She 's killing everyone in the project . - You got the blocker ? - What ? You 've gotta keep her keep it away from her . You gotta stop her . She 'll destroy us . We 've got to go . - No . - She 's gotta be stopped . It 's a lie ! - Easy . - It 's a lie ! Move it ! Let go ! I 'm not leaving my dad ! Has everyone gone crazy ? What the hell is going on around here ? What the hell is Phantom ? It 's a mind-control device . What ? A mind-control device . It controls anyone with a GS code . There 's no way something like that can exist . Is it really that hard to believe ? Just look around you . That 's the real purpose of the GS code , to control people ! Do you have the blocker ? Yeah . She 's coming for it . That 's the problem . She could destroy us . - She won 't get it , Dad . - She 'll destroy us . What the ... Something 's wrong . Fucking Phantom . You used it to manipulate people 's minds and turn them into puppets , right ? No , we didn 't . This wasn 't supposed to happen . I knew Keira was innocent . You ruined the lives of everyone that you controlled . It was all Rush . She took over the Business Center and killed innocent people . Why ? We were after the blocker . As long as we have it with us , we 're going to be safe . Dad ! We 've gotta put an end to it . An end to what ? Oppression . The Phantom . Why build it ? To make a better society . To make people happy . You can 't force happiness into people 's lives . I 'm sorry , son . I wasn 't there for you . I should 've been there for you . What are you doing ? Go ! Your girl needs saving , so go save her then ! I will . I wasn 't there . No , Dad . Just ... Just ... I love you . Everything 's gonna be all right , okay ? Just don 't leave me . Timur . Took awhile to find you . Hands on your head . Slowly . I looked up to you , you know . And now you 've betrayed us . Marah ... we 're friends . You know me . I can 't do this . I hate ... If you think I 'm guilty , then shoot . It 's that simple . Go ahead . Come on . I won 't go . Not alive . Good idea . He 'll come for you and bring Zack . He 'd do anything to save your life . Zack will find us soon . He 'll trace our location . You , my dear , have just helped me . There 's something beautiful about a weapon . You know ? In its perfection . I 'll have to hack into GS headquarters and scan the logs . Let 's hope they left us some tracks . " Help me . The Phantom is going to kill us . " Their firewall 's unreal . All the ports are blocked . It 's gonna take hours to find a way in . Hey . How goes it ? Hey , Jackie . I 'm looking for a girl . No problem . Let 's go . So ... done much on your own ? Finding her can 't be easy . Why are you here ? Move . This thing is old . Um , I figure if we 're on our own , Rush will find us and pick us off . But together we have a chance . A good one . Bingo . If I hadn 't stopped to help you out here , I never would 've found this secret lab . Keira 's definitely there . Rush is nuts . We gotta stop her . I agree . Partners ? She 'll pay for everything . You know , the Phantom has to go . My dad 's creation could do so much for the world . Just try to imagine all the possibilities . Financial crises , wars , unemployment . Capitalism is dead . All because of the Phantom . Do you really believe that garbage you 're spouting ? What gives you the right to decide all of our fates ? You don 't get it . We can help millions using it . - Help them ? You lost your dad . - Yeah . Destroy the Phantom . Hasn 't it cost you enough ? Think about it . I was once weak . Like you . Then I realized ... if you don 't rule , you get ruled . Have you ever felt what it 's like to have power over someone ? Unlimited power . I also know what it 's like to feel pain . To be a slave . A toy for other people . At first , I hated them for it , for depriving me of my freedom . I dreamt of death . Help me out . No one helped me . And then I realized that they all had to pay it all . Everything . Okay , I 'll insert a GS code into Zack 's left eye and change yours , Timur . You can trust Jackie here . He 's a pro . He wrote an app for reading GS code data . You created it for others . And then you hacked your own creation ? Hey , we all have to survive . So are you ready to become somebody else ? Whatever you say . Sit . Here we go . Is what you 're saying even possible ? Of course it is . A bit illegal , but that 's a given . Done . Go ahead . Hold still . So we can 't reach the airport without these . We 'll use them to get the tickets to the U.S. , and then Jackie will remove them . It 's very risky . There 's no other way though . Hello . Welcome to KZ Airlines Hello . Two tickets to Los Angeles . Understood . Please stand by as we proceed with the GS code scan . GS code scan complete . Rush , according to the device , Zack 's GS code was scanned . Excellent . Enter your signature here . Who 's account ? Don 't ask so many questions . - Have a nice ... - Zack , get out ! Jackie ! We gotta go ! There 's no way out . What about these GS codes ? Only he could remove them . Hands up . The flight 's changed . To L.A. Something tells me that you 'll reconsider it . No GS ! No GS ! The world is anxiously awaiting the results of this historic vote . Meanwhile , activist groups across various countries have unified , pressuring as though ... It 's official . The heads of state have agreed to the online summit . In the next few hours , they 'll be deciding the future of GS code adoption . It 's a shame though . It has been a very valuable asset . We follow orders . We don 't discuss them . You have that empty feeling , Zack ? You know what I did when I felt like that ? I went to work . And do you know what I learned from work ? I learned that what makes one the wealthiest man in this world is just to have the ownership of one 's own ... imagination . You have that . You could change the fate of this whole goddamn planet . Just imagine . I set one piece of information ... in your eye . Where am I ? Your dad 's second workplace . Thousands of people have died . All for the sake of his work . My father wouldn 't allow that . Are you that naive to think the Phantom is the result of lab rat tests ? Through underground companies , your father hired people for high-paying jobs . And now where are they all ? You perverted my father 's ideas . All these deaths , it was just so you mount a takeover of the corporation , right ? I deserve it more ... than people like him . I gave plenty to this corporation over the years . A lot of blood , sweat and tears . More than enough to own it , in my humble opinion . I never wanted the corporation . I just loved you . It 's amazing how a guy could be so blind ! They 'll be abolishing it soon , and the corporation will fall . You really think someone can get in my way ? What are you scheming ? Something ... special . Now that I have the blocker , that is . - There 's no blocker . - What ? Tell me again what we 're looking for . There 's nothing here . Ah , it 's a waste of time . Hang in there . Why do you think Charles Ingrim was here ? I don 't know . Come on . Let 's go . Wait . I remember this from Erlan 's office . It 's the same . What in the world was Charles Ingrim doing up here ? What did he want ? Maybe I can try to decode it . This looks like a search system . For what ? Don 't worry about it . It 's over . Sorry . What you 're suggesting is madness . All we need to do is reprogram the Phantom to expand its control level . How is that complicated ? Look here . Yes , we can control people . But that control is finite . Look at the screen . The key to controlling the human brain is the GS code . But if we expand the Phantom to a worldwide level of control , we 'll only fail . It would just drive everyone in the world mad . Phantom system online . Initiating self-destruction . Please don 't do this . No ! It won 't just be the heads of state ! We 'll all ... That 's why I need the blocker , to get the protection we need . Don 't . Please . We can 't expand to that level of control without the blocker . You wanna die like your friend ? Go find the blocker . It 's gotta be somewhere , right ? Go find it . Give it to me . I-I 'll find it . - Well , then ? - Agent 370 is calling . Rush , we had it all wrong . I 've got it . The location . Sending you the code . It shows where the blocker is now . He has it . Hey ! Warning . The security system is shutting down . A system restart is required . Our task now is to provide security and support other agencies as well . Security ? But the summit 's online . The risks are minimal . It is an historic moment that will decide mankind 's fate . Will the GS code laws be abolished or not ? The heads of state are now connecting to the online summit to vote . The results are anyone 's guess . Zack , stop . Remember me ? Where 's Keira ? Zack . What 's wrong ? I 'd love another kiss , but I 'm busy . Zack is smarter than I thought . He made a courier out of you . All this time you had the blocker . Zack , expand the Phantom to worldwide control . We don 't have much time . What do you want ? You see , the GS code has been such a good tool all this time , so why should it be outlawed , right ? Take his girl and throw her off the deck . I don 't need her anymore . No ! No ! Wait for my signal . Stop it . Stop it ! You 're gonna drive millions of innocent people mad ! I think the world we live in is already mad . People chose to trade their freedom for the illusion of security . We 've hacked the online summit network . Excellent . Initializing total control . Kill him . Phantom system now set to total control . Zack . What are you waiting for ? Shoot him ! Thousands of people have died , all for the sake of his work . We could help millions . What gives you the right to decide all of our fates ? You ruined the lives of everyone that you controlled . Everything I believed was a lie . Zack , kill him ! I was wrong . We 're more than just minds for you to control . We 've got wills and souls . We 've all recovered from the technical issues . The coverage of the online summit will now continue . I 'll always be with you . Keira , I want you to know I love you . I need to find Zack . Be careful . - You okay ? - I am . Don 't worry . Look . All but one country has voted , and its choice will shift the balance as the ballot currently remains tied . The GS code has been abolished . Yes ! Global Security offices around the world have begun closing down . And the riots that took place during the world 's first online summit ended almost as mysteriously as they began , without any fanfare at all . Subsequent online summits yielded additional laws banning human experimentation . These laws were necessary after an anonymous tip led to the discovery of secret mind-control research facilities . The tumultuous situation across the globe has since stabilized . And it is the opinion of this reporter that mankind has proven itself worthy of this hard-fought freedom . The revenues have suffered . Not surprising , since GS coding was outlawed . We need to take drastic measures . A way to retain control . Why don 't we look into demand for vaccinations based on nanotechnology , for diseases that don 't even exist yet . - That 's interesting . - Life 's about control . Control that 's for the good of all mankind , of course . Great profits demand great sacrifices .

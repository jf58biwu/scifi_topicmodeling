 Last week 's sudden storm is nothing new for the people ... Slow down , will ya ? Relax , Rob . Easy for you to say . You don 't have Amelia Lewis waiting for you back home . Amelia Lewis , the Amelia Lewis ? - The one with the ... - Yeah . Obviously we can 't crash now . We gotta get you back to Amelia Lewis . You 're just jealous . - Did you hear that ? - The Curse of Marguerite has been blamed ... I think you broke something . Then go check it out . I 'm not going to check it out ! You broke it . Go ahead in back , check it out . You know what we 're hauling ? You really think I 'd let somebody put something on my truck , I didn 't know what it was ? Do you know what 's special about them ? You know what they are ? Yeah , I heard the same thing , too . I don 't believe any of it . Pete said they shot them up with a bunch of drugs and then they started ... Pete needs to learn to keep his mouth shut . ... of Marguerite 's ghost . Check it out ! What ? Are you scared ? - I 'm not scared . - Amelia Lewis doesn 't like scared boys . Flood waters quickly receding and meteorologists reporting a beautiful weekend forecast , though . Just watch the road , okay ? If you 're scared , just remember Amelia Lewis . - I gotta get back to Amelia Lewis . - Shut up , okay ? What in the world ? What the heck is that ? Oh , man ! You did break something ! No . What ? You did break something . No ! No ! Rob ? Rob ? It 's started . It 's started . No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! Stay away from me ! No ! No ! No ! No ! No ! I now pronounce you man and wife .

I 'm so happy for you guys . It was amazing . I 'll be right back . So happy for you . - Hello , darling . - Hi . You didn 't have to come to her wedding . You kidding me ? This is great . Let 's get away for the day . I got plans this weekend . I was gonna hole myself up in my room and listen to Lionel Richie and cry . Come on . Remember when we were kids and our folks would always take us and Bryce out ... Chris , I 'm so sorry . I 'm such an idiot . When 's the last time we were out at the point together ? I haven 't been there in a long time , Ash . Place doesn 't exactly conjure up good feelings for me . Yeah , but , I mean , we should go . I go out all the time , and Ian 's got his family boat for the day . I don 't want to hang out with Ian . He hates me . Please ! Come on , Chris . Sam 's going , of course . Kerri will be there . - You trying to set me up right now ? - It 's not a set-up . I don 't need a pity date , Ash . It 's not , you 'd be doing me a favor . Ian always gets so plastered every time we go out on the boat . If you guys don 't come , he 's just gonna want to mess around the whole time . And I want somebody who can actually carry a conversation , you know ? You got problems in paradise ? No , just Ian 's Ian . You know how it is . Frat parties were fun at first , but , I mean , you gotta grow up sometime . Please , please , please , please . You have to come . All right . Okay , you will not regret this . - I regret it already . - I 'm so excited . Can you slow down , please ? I 'm trying to be somber here . Please tell me some good news . So tell me , Hutch , those tech guys that called this in , were they right ? Looks like it . On a scale of one to ten , one being , " Let 's go get some coffee . " Ten being , " How do you want to spend your last night on earth , " what are we looking at ? Ten ? Looks more like a 20 . That 's what I was afraid of . " Specimen 0 , " what 's that ? I don 't know , but whatever it was , it was a lot bigger than the others . You shouldn 't be out here ! Unless you prepared for what you might find ! Better get back , sir ! It 's not safe just yet ! No ! No ! The danger just getting started ! It 's gonna be one of those backwater towns , huh ? Salvage what you can . I want an expanding perimeter on the swamp . Yes , sir ! Hey , Chris , it 's me . Why don 't you give me a call ? I 'm just thinking about you . I told her , " Look , honey , Trevor is my man . " Yes , I did . I told her that she lost her chances with him that last night at bingo , and that if she didn 't like it , well , then I 'd be happy to walk on over there and shove my foot right up ... Morning , Marge . Marge ! Marge ! Will you get that damn hearing aid fixed ? - Lucille . - Ranger Hardin . You know , that Davids boy was out past my property the other night blasting his dynamite again . Yeah , well , I 'll go have a little talk with him , then . Well , you best head on down to the dock , then , ' cause he 's there right now . And I hear Chris is with him . My Chris ? This is Specimen number five . - Is that the last one ? - No , I got a few more to collect . - Do you hear that ? - Yeah . - We should go check that out . - All right , come on . - Did you hear that ? - I did . - It 's over there . - Let 's go . All right , let 's do this . I 'm excited , and you ? - Yeah , I know . - You know I am excited . I know , Chris , Chris , Chris , that 's all you talk about . Yeah , well , we haven 't done this in so long . Just hang back with the boat , I gotta go find Chris . Yes , ma 'am . Hey , partner , there 's some good-lookers down in the swamp today , eh ? Drop dead . Make me wish I was 20 year younger . Oglin ' the coeds again , boys ? Sorry , Ranger Hardin . Just enjoying the Blackbriar sights . Hey , Chris , you made it ! Hi ! Chris . Hey . Fun . Don 't worry about him , you 're here with me . Hey , Ashley ! How are you ? Good to see you . Chris , what 's up ? Right this way , dear wench . - Shut up . - What ? Hey , Chris , like my new swimsuit ? It 's cute , thank you . You need help with the beer or anything like that ? Come on , let 's go . You chucking ' your line today , Brutus ? Sure . You want us to bring you back a big , old gator head ? You can hang it on your wall ? You get brave on us , Sheriff , come out on gator water with us , huh ? Chipmunk said you should come out to the boat with us . Well , maybe sometime I 'll surprise you , but in the meantime , be careful and watch the drinking , huh ? Yeah , don 't be so scared . So you actually went to that wedding . What a loser . - Sucker . - Stop it . It was a sweet gesture . A true gentleman can admit when he 's been defeated . Yeah , but what loser wants to be a gentleman ? Stop it . Stop . If this is going on all weekend , I 'll shoot somebody . Hey , Ranger Hardin . Hey , Ashley . Mom . I 'll be right back . Just wait up . Mom , what are you doing here ? I have been calling your cell phone for days ! I 've been busy , Mom . I 'm sorry , okay ? So , how was the wedding ? I mean , I thought maybe you 'd want to talk afterwards . It was fine . Whatever , I don 't care . It was nice . Is that the Davids ' boat ? Yes . My office has gotten a few calls about Ian doing some dynamite fishing . Now , I haven 't caught him yet , but if I do catch him and whoever he 's with , they 're gonna be in some big trouble , so I 'm hoping that is not what you were planning on doing this weekend . No , we 're just going out to have some fun , all right ? It 's not a big deal , it 's innocent , okay ? Okay , you just be careful . That swamp , it can be mean . Dad told me that you filed the other day . I thought you were gonna try to patch things up . Honey , it 's not that simple . And are you sure that this is the right move for you guys ? - Christopher , honey . - It 's fine . It 's fine . Kerri Ponter , is that you ? Yes , ma 'am . - Does your grandma know you 're here ? - Mom . - Are you nuts ? - What ? She 's underage for drinking and you 're dragging her out - to your wild orgy . - She 's not drinking . Wild orgies , what are you talking about ? Where do you get this stuff from ? - Do you think she 'll call my grandma ? - No . We 're just going out on the boat to have a little fun on the water . Man , come on . You coming ? I 'm shoving off . - All right , I gotta go . - Wait , wait . - I gotta go . - Wait , wait , wait , listen ... Honey , I really want to hang out with you , so , how about I make you some dinner , something like that ? Maybe . Yeah , no , that 'd be nice . I 'd like that . - Let 's do it . I 'll talk to you . - Okay . Be safe . Au revoir , Ranger ! Be careful out there . I like her ! Can 't stop us now , we 're going ! We 're going over this way . Let 's head back to the station . Yes , ma 'am . I tried to hold you off , but you keep pushing . These people , they ain 't the ones hurting you . No ! Haven 't you been in pain long enough ? Let it go . What 's it gonna take for you to be satisfied ? It 's war , then . Keep going , it 's right up there . Who got it better than us , Brutus ? Every day a good day in the swamp . Even bad day a good day in the swamp . You got that right , my friend . That 's all true . How much further until we get to that other line ? We should be there by now . Hush , hush , looky there . Looky there . That 's a big , old gator track there . Yeah , yeah , I think we coming up on something big , man . We got him on the run , too , the way that line is all tight . Come on , let 's get in there and get him . - Y 'all want fish for dinner ? - We don 't have any poles , though . - Oh , my God ! - Here you go . Here you go . Yeah , baby . Everybody , lunch is almost ready ! Lunch ! Y 'all want to fish first ? What a day , what a day ... She big like pig , where she go ... Brutus , what 's this ? Hey ! Anybody there ? Are y 'all hurt ? We 're gonna have to call this in to Ranger Hardin . Hey ! Hey ? Marge ! Damn it , Marge , would you turn up your hearing aid ? Blackbriar Parks and Recreations , this is Ranger Hardin speaking . Hey , Brutus . Did y 'all get me that gator head you promised me ? All right , I 'm gonna assume that you 're sober while you 're giving me this report , so was it a pick-up or a semi ? No , it 's a delivery truck , ran into a tree stump . Right . Yeah , there 's white containers in the water . There 's more on the ground laying on a tarp . There 's more in the back of the truck , there 's some blood . Blood ? This truck , it 's got blood all in it . There 's more containers in there , big container , too , that 's all busted open . Yeah , I thinkin ' Marguerite is getting pretty riled up . Okay , you steer clear . Matt and I are gonna come and check it out . - What 'd she say ? - She said steer clear . They gonna come check it out . Meanwhile , let 's go find that line you lost . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Make-up 's gonna come off when you get in the water anyway , huh ? So , what happened with your mom ? - Nothing . - Nothing ? Yeah , no , we 're fine , it 's good . It 's good , I 'm just happy to be out here . Having fun , I 'm glad you invited me . - Yeah , I 'm glad you 're here . - I am , I am . - You 're such a loser . - All right , let 's do it ! It 's what y 'all came here for , right ? Later ! Amazing ! Come on , you coming ? All right , I 'm up . It 's perfect . That is the only one-piece I have ever enjoyed . You sure you 're okay with the whole Kerri thing ? Yes , it 's fine , it 's stupid . - She really likes you . - That 's ... No , I 'm not interested . Do you have a lighter or a bottle opener ? Come on , get in ! - I don 't know , y 'all . I don 't know about this . - You 're gonna drown me . Come on , get in ! The fish aren 't gonna bite . Okay , all right . - I 'm not a raft , you can 't pull me down . - Get off me . Looks like little Miss Kerri Ponter grew up . Shut up ! - Shut up . - What ? Look at her . Come on , let 's go ! That 's what we 're here for ! - Are you sure you 're okay ? - Yes , I 'm fine . - You just seem a little ... - I 'm fine , I 'm having fun . - Okay , I 'm sorry . - I 'm having fun , and you know what ? - I 'm jumping in . All right . - Okay . - Okay ? I 'm fine . - Yeah . - Have fun . - Don 't worry about me . - I 'm worried about you . - Don 't worry about me . I 'm all right . Sorry . Come on ! Get in ! Get in , come on ! There you go ! The classic Prayer Dive , huh ? Very nice , hard-on . Ash , get in ! Let 's go . No , you guys , you guys have it . Ashley ! Ashley ! Ashley ! Jump in my arms , baby ! How 's the water down there ? Down ! You 're going down . I found the line . I told you there 's another line out here . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Here we go . Here we go . Oh , yeah . That feel like a good one . This be present for fair Ranger Hardin , huh ? I think she got crush on me . - Here it comes , get ready ! Get ready ! - Yeah , yeah , yeah . - What did that ? - Haven 't seen that before ! My God . I dropped the line . Easy , now . It 's tangled up . Get your hand out of there . Get your hand out of there ! - What 's the matter ? - Get your hand out of there . Get your hand out of there ! Brutus ! Do we have to really walk through this swamp ? Come on , you big baby . I 'll take care of you . Yeah , yeah , yeah . So you can 't really blame your mom . I mean , I love your dad , but he 's not very ... Attentive ? Yeah . He can get a little preoccupied . And your mom 's been really sad for a long time , ever since ... Bryce . You can say his name , you know . My dad 's been so sad ever since my mom left , it was really hard on him . I mean , all of us , obviously , but I just wish I knew how to help him . You know , help both of them . I don 't know what to do . Sometimes you can 't help . People grow apart . It happens . Why don 't you just break up with him ? Because , I don 't know , I 'm just ... I 'm so used to being us , I don 't know how to be me anymore . I know who you are . You 're just a punk with questionable taste in dudes . You 're such a jerk . Fine , you 're mildly decent , then . This is nice . I know , this is exactly what I want . I want one . No , try again in a couple of years , when you 're actually of age . Really ? Just looking out for you . You suck . Whatever , you 'll thank me eventually . You okay ? It 's like he doesn 't even see me . Kerri , Chris is actually one of the good guys , okay ? You don 't want to come off as easy . Do that and you 'll attract guys like my old man or Ian . - Trust me . - Head 's up , ladies ! - How did I know he was gonna do that . - Oh , my God ! You 're such an ass . I ruined my back . Why , you got wet ? - Kerri , did you get wet ? - Ian ! Little Kerri kind of got wet , huh ? - Stop . - You got wet ? Oh , Kerri ! What are we gonna do ? Where is all this water coming from ? Where 's it all coming ... Where 's it all coming from ? Have a blast ! What ? Sam , come on . Whatever . I 'm over this . Have fun . Really ? What 's her problem ? Is this her beer ? Yeah . Where 's your beer ? She doesn 't let me have one , but now that she 's gone ... Boy , I sure am hungry for lunch . I 'll tell you that much . Me , too . Look at right over there . Yeah . You think Marge got us something good ? I doubt it . - No way , huh ? - No way , babe . All righty , let me tie us up . You need some help ? - I think I got it . - Okay , good . Let me grab you over here . - Yes , ma 'am . - Thanks . Watch your step . - Thank you . - Good job . He wasn 't lying . Looks like we got a big , old truck crashed in our swamp , Carly . Yeah , we sure do . I wonder what they were hauling . Think it could be toxic waste or something ? I don 't know , but obviously an investigation has been started . Somebody should be here . Where the hell is everybody ? Blackbriar Curse strikes again . - Right ? - That 's not funny . Sorry , I 'm just saying , this is crazy . Great , now I gotta make phone calls all afternoon to try and figure out this mess . Isn 't that Brutus ? Yeah , probably got drunk and fell asleep again . Old moonshine . Hey , Brute ! Chip ! Why don 't you go check out that cab . I 'm gonna check out that boat . Copy you . Brutus ? Chipmunk ? Oh , God ! Brutus . - What is it ? What 's wrong ? - Marge , Marge , it 's Ranger Hardin , come in ! Marge ! Damn it ! What did you see ? What happened ? Matt ! Stay away from the water ! Matt ! Matt ! Matt ! Matt ! I need help ! Help me ! Help ! Help ! Matt ! Matt ! Matt ! Matt ! Matt ! Chris ? Ashley ? Oh , my God , you creep ! Don 't do that ! What ? Did you think it was the Blackbriar Curse ? Old slump hag coming to get you . - Shut up . - What ? I thought you liked a little excitement . Remember ? Are you crazy ? Ashley 's right over there . Well , I mean , that makes it kind of hotter , though , right ? No , it doesn 't . What ? That was a mistake , okay ? That 's not how you felt before . I was drunk , and it was stupid , and you 're a creep . Come on , come here . What are you gonna do ? Maybe I 'll go see if Kerri wants to party , then . Keep doing that , and you can expect one of those every day for the rest of your life , jerk . You know what ? You 're right . I 'm having a really nice time out here . - Good . - This is good . I can see why my brother loved it so much . It 's got a charm . - I 'm glad . - I haven 't been here in so long . Don 't give me that look . Okay , fine . You want to talk about it ? Please ! Fine . The wedding , it was nice . It was , she 's happy , she looked great . Her man is nice , which I hate . I don 't know , I 'm happy for him . They ... I 'm over it ! Sure you are . Do not start with me like that . Don 't start what ? Don 't start something you can 't finish now . Come on , you scared of a girl now ? Let 's go ! Come on ! Easy ! Watch it ! Come on ! Problem ? I 'm not sure . Come on . Sam ? Where are you guys ? Guys ! Get off of me ! Something ! Something out there ! - Sam ! Get off of me ! Help ! - Something out there ! - Kerri ! - Get off of her ! - Kerri ! - Get off of her ! Kerri ! Come on , you okay ? - Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! - Kerri ! Come on . Come on . I got you . Come on , easy ! Easy ! Something out there ! Something out there ! We gotta leave ! We gotta leave ! I want to get out ! No gator ! No snake ! Easy ! - He 's all covered in blood ! - What 's wrong with him ? Probably just some drunk fool , fisherman falling out of his boat . I don 't see any boat around , man . We can 't leave this guy here , okay ? We gotta take him somewhere . Look at him ! What if he has a disease or something ? We gotta get this guy back to town . Screw that , dude . This dude is not getting in my parents ' boat . Ian , we have to get him to a hospital ! This bloody fool is not getting in my parents ' boat ! We 're not gonna leave him here . Now help me get him up . Let 's go ! Right now ! - Come on , come on . - I 'm not helping , just get him up . - All right , man , we got you . - Just get on the boat , guys . We got you . Come on , you 're all right . Thank you . Come on , Ma . Pick up the phone . Pick up the phone , Ma . Come on ! It 's the one time I call her , she 's not answering . There 's no one at the station . I don 't know . We 're gonna get home . We 're gonna get home . What 's the hold-up here ? Let 's go ! Can we get him something to drink ? Something other than beer ? Here you go , old man , this 'll make you feel better . No , no , no , go quick , quick , quick , get out ! Something out there I never seen ! Not gator , not snake , not fish ! Too big . One ate Brutus ! It gobbled him gone ! Come back for us next . Dead ! Dead ! This old coot 's not drunk , he 's nuts . Was there an accident ? Not accident , no , snakefish ! Ate Brutus dead ! He dead ! Great , thanks a lot , Ash . Exactly how I wanted to spend my weekend , babysitting some old drunk . Don 't be an ass , okay ? It wouldn 't hurt you to think of someone else for once . - Sam , it 's okay . - The hell it is , okay ? - Quit apologizing for him . - All right , enough ! This isn 't helping anybody . Ian , you take me , Sam and Kerri back . We 'll take care of him , and you and Ashley come back and have some fun . No ! I 'm coming with you . What ? Ian can have his boat all to himself . What do you say , Kerri ? You want to stay here with me , or do you want to go with them ? - Look at that ! Look at that ! - What the hell 's your problem , old man ! See ? See ? We got to kill them , before they kill us all dead ! What is that ? Fish ? What is that ? I 've never seen so many of them . - It 's like a school of fish , right ? - What do they want ? Maybe they 're hungry . Let 's throw Sam in and see ... - Oh , my God ! - Man , stop ! - I 'm joking ! - We got to kill that thing ! - You 're crazy ! - We got ... They ... What are you talking about ? Nobody understands ! Idiot kids ! Do something ! Don 't even think about it , old man ! No , stop ! Stop ! Are you all right ? - Back up ! - Mistake ... Kerri ! - Right here . I 'm right here . - I 'm okay . - You all right ? - Yeah , she 's fine , everyone . What is your problem ? Get ... - Kerri ! Take her hand ! - Come on ! Come on ! Kerri ! Kerri ! Kerri ! Help ! Somebody help ... - Kerri ? Kerri , get out ! - What happened ? Kerri ! No ... - Get us out of here ! - Yeah . Oh , my God ! Where 's Kerri ? What happened ? They killed the motor . Oh , no , we got to leave . We got to go , not safe . The engine 's dead . We 're stranded . Marguerite , I didn 't want to have to do this . Where are you ? Where are you ? Marge , I need you to make a call ! Ranger Hardin ? And you are ? I 'm Trooper Mark Simon with the Louisiana State Police . Can I ... - Carly ? - Jim ... Thank God ! Are you okay ? What happened ? Ranger Hardin , can I talk to you in private ? Anything you have to say to her , you can say in front of me . I 'm her husband . Ex-husband . Soon to be ex-husband . It 's complicated , forget it . Let 's go , you guys . - All right , guys , ready ? - Yeah . Ready , hut . One Mississippi , two Mississippi , three Mississippi . So what the hell is going on in Blackbriar ? Early this morning , a delivery truck carrying a cargo of Channa micropeltes crashed down by 8-Mile Ditch . Snakeheads ? They 're indigenous to Southeast Asia , but they 're not found in Louisiana . I teach at the community college , a biology professor ... Associate instructor . I mean , tenure is so very political ... Point is , I know my fish . Channa micropeltes is ... Well , it 's the most aggressive of the snakehead species . No kidding . Well , there have been infestations in the States before , but usually it 's some yahoo gets a couple as pets and decides to dump ' em in the river . Did you know that it only takes them two years to reach maturity and that a fully grown female adult can lay as many as 15,000 eggs at a time . It takes quite a lot to feed that many babies , and it 's not long before snakeheads have wiped out all other marine life . And we 're a half day behind this . There was an infestation in Maryland . Now , the authorities caught the fish , but the new RD team decided they wanted to sterilize it . - What happened ? - When I got off the phone with them , they were still figuring out what was going on . The serum they used made the fish more aggressive , bolder and smarter . Before long , they could become the perfect predator . Chris ! Chris is on the water with his friends ! - Use this . - I don 't know how to use this , Carly . Just aim this at the man-eating killer fish , and then you pull the trigger , okay ? Do it . Marge ! Marge ! Marge , turn up your hearing aid . Okay , listen . I want to quarantine the beaches and the swamp until further notice . I want everybody out of the water and off the shore . Got it ? Closing off the swamp won 't be enough . He 's right , snakeheads have kind of an air chamber in their skulls that can act as a makeshift lung . They can breathe on land for up to three days . By using the muscles in their fins , they can almost walk . And that 's just a normal snakehead , without genetic modifications . Who knows what these snakeheads are capable of . Three days ' time , they could have the whole town overrun . My God ! Nowhere is safe . Here , I 'm open ! Catch it ! Yes ! Oh , my God ! Let 's get out of here ! It 's okay , it 's okay . Just breathe , just breathe , just breathe . It 's okay . Just breathe , just breathe . Just breathe . It 's gonna be okay . - Would you let go of him ? - Get your hands off of me ! What the hell are those things ? What did you do ? - I do nothing ! - Leave him alone ! Ian , stop it ! You 're not helping anything ! You , we wouldn 't even be out here , if it wasn 't for you . You think I don 't know why we 're all really out here ? - It 's all about him . - Me ? - It 's always about him . - Get over yourself . Should just toss him overboard , just like Kerri , right ? You son of a ... - Don 't say that ! - Forget about it ! We have more important things to worry about . The lines are still busy . Your dad doesn 't have a radio on this boat ? Dad was supposed to fix it on Tuesday . Of course he was . Look , look ! Looky there ! Maybe we 're not all done for yet ! What is he saying ? Maybe God will not kill us , or what ? Look , look , see ? We gotta get to that house . First good idea all day . So what ? We get through the swamp and then call for help ? Yeah , and who do we call when there 's a killer fish epidemic ? - What was that ? - The fish ! The fish ! - They 're everywhere ! - Oh , my God ! The fish are everywhere ! They 're coming . The fish , they 're coming back ! They 're everywhere . Just calm down ! We just have to work together . - Get out of the way , Sam . - Just calm down ! - Get away from me ! - Oh , my God ! They 're breaking through ! We are so gonna die out here . We 're not gonna die , all right ? We 're gonna get to that house . How ? There 's no way to kill these mother ... - Wait . - What ? Dynamite . The rumors were true . That 's good . I got you ! I got you . I got you . - Thanks , man . - Yeah , no problem . Yeah ! That 's a good one . Yeah . How you doin ' , little guy ? That 's what I 'm talkin ' about . You gonna make a good meal . Yes , you are . You are such a big fish . That 's gonna be a good dinner . That 's gonna be a good dinner . Where 's my cleaver ? I 'm gonna kill something . It was just here . Am I losing my mind ? Holy mackerel ! Where 'd he go ? He 's gone ? I just had it ! Do you remember when the boys were little and we 'd bring Bryce and Chris down to the bayou ? Bryce would get up in the bow , and start waving his arms like he was a bird . - There 's a lot of good memories . - Jim , don 't . Look , I 'm ... I took you for granted for a long time , I realize that , but I never stopped loving you . We 've already been through all of this . We 're different people . We want different things . I want us to be a family again . What do you want ? We need to make sure that everyone 's safe near the water . Wait a second , I thought we were out here looking for Chris . We don 't have time to stop and warn everybody up and down the bayou . That 's Jessup 's boat . Maybe he saw where Chris was headed . Jessup ? Jessup ! It 's Ranger Hardin from Blackbriar Parks and Recreation . Here . Oh , God ! It 's twice as big as it was before . I got this . Jim , the safety 's on ! What ? Watch out , Jim ! Watch out ! Ranger , come on up . Hurry ! Come on . What are you doing here , Mr. Boudreaux ? The swamp , she 's angry . Marguerite 's up to her old tricks again . You can 't stay here . The swamp isn 't safe . It 's not safe for none of us until the swamp get paid what she got coming . All these years , I tried to make her happy , but ... We really have to go . When I give you the word , you run like hell to the boat . You need to go home . We have to find her , Ranger . She 's the heart of this bayou . You have to fight her . Go home ! Lock the doors and stay there . Okay , are you ready ? Yeah , I think we 've got a clear path so far , so ... Run . Give me the gun . You drive . So , let me get this straight . Not only do we have an infestation of killer fish , but they 're getting bigger . If they sprout wings and fly , I 'm done . I don 't know what they did to these snakeheads , but it has cranked up the evolutionary process and kicked it into overdrive . They are adapting at a far greater rate than mother nature ever intended . I don 't know what these researchers did , but ... Or it could be what William Boudreaux said . It could be the Curse of the Blackbriar Swamp . God knows this swamp has taken enough out of our family . Carly , we 'll find our boy . We 'll find Chris . We gotta get rid of these things , and we gotta make a run for it . All right , I 'll take some of the dynamite with us , and you take the flare gun . - Okay . - Keep it in the bag , all right ? - Right . - We gotta get out of here . - All right , ladies , let 's go . - Where are we gonna go ? - We 're going to that house . - But they 're gonna take us over . No , they 're not . That 's for Brutus , you damn snakefish ! Stick this where you live , Marguerite ! You stinking witch ! Are you actually insane , man ? You 're gonna kill all of us ! Look out ! Let 's move ! Come on , let 's go , let 's go ! Come on . Come on . Let 's go . Come on ! - Come on . - But the fish ! We still have to make it through the whole swamp ! I 'm gonna take care of you . Come on . There you are . Oh , Marguerite . What you done done ? Come on , keep going ! Keep going ! - I can 't . - Don 't stop ! Are you okay ? Are you all right , man ? Are you all right , man ? Yeah . Shoot it . Come on , shoot it ! Let 's go ! Come on ! Come on , man , shoot him ! - Doesn 't work , great . Let 's go . - Come on ! Come on ! We got it beat ! Come on ! We need help ! - Please help us ! - Hello ? - Please help us ! - Hello ! Hello ! I don 't see anybody . - You see anybody ? - No , I don 't see anyone ! Is it open ? Someone help us . Come on , kick it in . We don 't have time . Hello ? Is anyone here ? Come on , we gotta block these doors . I don 't see ' em anywhere , man . There ! How are they crawling like that ? They 're fish . I think they 're growing . They look bigger , too . - Why ? - The Blackbriar Curse . No , no , no . I don 't believe that . I don 't care if it 's the curse , or radiation , or psycho fish from space , we have to kill those things . Ian 's right , okay , we gotta barricade the house . We gotta make sure it 's secure . Look for weapons , axes , a machete , a gun rack , whatever , okay ? We gotta close all the doors and the windows . Ian , check this room , okay ? I 'm going this way . Look , I don 't remember making you leader . Now we can work together , but I 'm not taking orders from you . Ian ! Just do it ! Come on , I 'll look with you . Come on , let 's get to work . God , I hate this swamp . I never should have stayed . Why did you ? For you and Chris , you both loved it so much . Chris had his friends here , and I know how much you admire your students , and I thought if I were a ranger , you know , I could help make things safer . Keep something like what happened to Bryce ever happening to anyone again . You can 't always stop the bad things from happening , Carly . I grew up hearing about that curse , that curse , that curse . - I never believed it . - You can 't blame a curse for what happened . Bryce was ... It was an accident . Well , who can I blame , then , Jim ? Well , you seem to be doing a fine job of blaming me . I don 't blame you . Isn 't that why you left me ? I told him he could go out on the bayou that night with his friends , after you told him he couldn 't . - It 's my fault . - Jim ... It 's my fault . It 's my fault . Jim . I don 't blame you for hating me . It 's what I 'd do . Jim . I 've already lost too much , all right ? I can 't stand to lose any more . What 's that ? That 's Ian Davids ' boat . Oh , my God ! Chris . What if Chris ... What if something happened to Chris ? No , no , Carly . Carly , look , we 're good , we 're good . I mean , look , they might have swum ashore , huh ? Yeah . Okay . - We 're good , we 're good . - Okay . Let 's get in there and check it out . Molotov cocktails . We could throw them at them , while we make a retreat . You know , Bryce died two years ago . Since then , I thought a lot about how I might die . Not one time did I ever consider killer fish . We 're gonna make it through this . Kerri didn 't , the old man on the boat didn 't . But we will . Yeah , just stay here and keep an eye on them , all right ? I 'm gonna go look around just in case the whole fire bomb thing doesn 't pan out . It would work . Sam . Sam ! Come see . What ? Oh , my gosh , what in the world is this ? Pretty freaky , right ? That 's disgusting . What 's all this for , anyways ? Don 't mess with it . It 's like voodoo . It stinks , is what it is . - What was that ? - Grab that knife . What ? Garage door 's open . I 'm gonna have to close it , before those things get in . What if they 're already inside ? There 's a radio in there . Okay , let 's go . We should probably go get Chris and Ashley . Screw Chris . Ashley probably already is . - Shut up , go close the door . - Don 't push me . Hello , is anybody there ? Hello , is anybody there ? Please ! They 're outside . Hello , is anybody there at all ? Please , please ! If anybody 's there , please respond ! They 're inside . Hide ! Hide . Sam ! Sam , help me ! - Are you okay ? - Yeah . Ian ! Ian , wait ! Ian ! Ian ! Open the door ! Ian , let me out ! Ian ! Let me out ! Ian , let me out ! Choke on that , coward . - You hear something ? - What was that ? - Come on ! - Wait ! We 're sorry , we didn 't know anybody was home . What are you doing here , gal ? The swamp , it ain 't safe . There were snakes outside , and we were just trying to protect ourselves . Swamp , she 's angry this time . Marguerite 's gonna get her vengeance tonight . - What are you talking about ? - Curse of Blackbriar Swamp . No , I refuse to believe that . It 's just a story . There 's no such thing as a curse . That 's where you 're wrong , little gal . Marguerite , she has her ways . So that 's Marguerite Boudreaux . I wasn 't even sure if she was real . She 's real , all right . Marguerite Boudreaux . My great , great-grandmother . She was a powerful mamba . Lived in Blackbriar nearly 200 years ago . Marguerite took payment for healing the sick and serving as a priestess to the Loa for the Haitian immigrants . They called her Queen , " Queen of the Swamp . " Yeah ? I heard she was executed for murder . For killing a little kid . I heard she put a hex on a slave owner , and that 's what did it . Everybody hears it different . - Maybe they 're all right . - Or maybe none of it 's true . She 's dead , all right . That 's a fact . Murdered by the people of Blackbriar . After that , the swamps turned mean . These here swamps , Marguerite 's . She they queen . And them creatures out there , she brought ' em back to her swamp to do her bidding ' . This is ridiculous . Why now , then ? Maybe she just been waitin for the right time , the right opportunity . Or maybe you 're full of voodoo crap . My little brother died in these swamps , and at the time , everybody said that it was an accident . But I knew I felt something . I knew there was something there . The swamp , she wants blood for blood . This is crazy . Are you sure about that ? Ian ! What happened ? They got inside , in the garage . I locked them in , but they killed Sam . - No ! - I tried to save her , but they almost got me . I 'm just glad you 're okay . All right . Who the hell are you ? William Boudreaux , and this is my house , boy . We need a phone . We gotta call help . I lost my phone when our ship went down . Me , too . No one to call , no one to help you now . Marguerite ain 't gonna stop until the swamp gets her full of blood . Not unless we stop her first . She been mad before , storms , floods , death . Marguerite threw a tantrum every now and again . No ! No ! This time she gone too far . What happens if we don 't get to her ? Then we all dead . Marge ! Marge , do you copy ? Marge ! Do you hear me ? Marge ! Damn it ! - Anything ? - No . Can 't even raise her . She can 't hear anything . The whole town is probably gone by now . Well , maybe she 's napping . This way . We 're almost there . It 's just down a way . The Boudreaux home , it 's just up a ways . Carly , what is this place ? It 's Boudreaux 's house . - Boudreaux ? - Just follow me . Okay . What the hell is he mumbling about ? - It 's the curse . - It 's the curse ? Yeah , I see all your damn hoodoo and whatnot . Bunch of crap , is what I say . Mr. Boudreaux , can you stop this ? My whole life I tried to keep Marguerite happy . Take care of the swamp , and she take care of you . That 's what my momma told me . But now ... What is this ? She got a demon protecting the grave . You 're gonna need a heat bag . Little agrimony , tobacco , goofer dust . Goofer dust . You use it to ward off the spirits . But only fire can burn out evil . She 's at the heart of the swamp . You got to help me destroy her . If you knew that Marguerite was the cause of all of this , why haven 't you done anything until now ? Why ? Same reason we don 't go killing all the gators in the bayou because of a few attacks . Nature has a balance . Marguerite kept the balance . But she 's out of control now . Chris , it 's your mom ! Mom . Shame what happened to your friend out in the garage . Yeah , it is . Be careful , boy . Marguerite got it out especially for betrayers . - Get in here ! - Thank God ! - Get in , get in ! - I 'm all right , I 'm all right . What are you all doing together ? Are you talking again ? We gotta get out of here , okay ? This place is gonna be crawling with those things any second now . My boat is down by the dock . Wait , Ian 's here and William Boudreaux . What about Sam and Kerri ? Oh , dear God ! - Ranger Hardin , what are we gonna do ? - We are going to survive . Ian , what are you doing ? I 'm not dying here because of some stupid fish , okay ? Now come on , old man . You said before you know how to stop this ? Spill it . - Let him go ! - Shut up ! We 've gotta find her heart , destroy it . She wrecked that truck at the source of her power . - Now let me go . - What the hell does that even mean ? She 's in the swamp , in its trees , in its water . You can 't escape the swamp . - Busting through the door ! - Run ! Eat this ! We 're out of here now ! This way 's clear ! Hurry ! Ian , come on ! What are you doing ? Let 's go , we gotta run , man ! Let 's go ! Somebody 's gotta kill these things . Oh , no ! You need to put that out ! - Mom ! - Carly ! - Mom ! Mom ! Are you okay ? - I 'm okay . Are you okay ? Chris , you need to go . Guys , the house is gonna collapse . - Chris , you need to go . - We have to get out of here . - No ! I 'm not going to leave her ! - I 'm not gonna lose you like I lost Bryce ! Go ! Mom ! Come on ! We have to go ! No ! Come on , sweetheart . I got you . - Come on ! We can 't stay here ! - Mom ! - No ! Mom ! - Come on ! The house is gonna fall ! Son . She 's all right . She 's all right . We lost you for a while there . Yeah , well , don 't lose me again . I won 't . We have to find Marguerite Boudreaux 's grave . We have to end this . I 'll go . I 'll go . Mr. Boudreaux , he said something about a truck wreck . I know where that is . She could be buried there . Well , we don 't know that for sure . But we have to do something . Chris , son , there isn 't anything we can do . The fish are continuing to evolve . Blackbriar is lost . - No ! - We need to leave while we can . No ! This is our home , and we have to fight for it . We 're not gonna give up on family . We have to do this for Bryce ! Sweetheart , what if Mr. Boudreaux was wrong ? What if there is no grave when you get there ? Mr. Boudreaux , he believed in this enough that he was willing to die for it . I have to try . I have to . Ian 's getting away ! There 's not a house around here for miles , we are gonna be stranded . I am gonna go to the grave . I know where it is . I can get there . I can walk there from here , but you get that damn boat . And if I don 't return , then you get out of Blackbriar and you get some help . And I don 't care if you call the whole damn Army . I 'm coming back , and I 'm bringing the cavalry , okay ? - I 'm coming with you . - No , no , no , you can 't . Your leg is all messed up . You 're just gonna slow me down . Then I 'll go with you . You shouldn 't go alone . What about Chris ? I got Chris covered , go . Okay , you stay safe until we return . Okay ? Ian ! Ian ! Stop ! All right , you can 't take the boat . We need that . My family needs that . Listen to me , we can make it out of this together , okay ? - You have to ... - I have to ? I 'm done taking orders from you ! What do you think , you 're a hero ? You have no idea what those things are , and I 'm not dying in this swamp , so stay out of my way . Chris ! Chris ! We don 't have to do this . You know , I never got what Ashley saw in you , but you can have her . I used her all up anyways . Say goodbye , Hardin . Ian ! Ian ! Come on . Ian ! Come on ! Ian , come on ! Where is he ? I don 't see him ! Come on ! Come on ! Ranger Hardin , do you hear me ? Hello ? Who is this ? This is Trooper Simon with the State Police . Who is this ? Where 's Ranger Hardin ? I 'm her son , Chris . Where 's your mom ? I 've gotta talk to her . The National Guard is here . They 're pushing the fish back into the swamp , but we 're not out of this yet . So what is that supposed to do , anyway ? Honestly , I don 't even know . Mr. Boudreaux said it 'll help fight the demon that 's out here protecting the grave . Do you see that ? - Come on . - There it is ! Do you really think that this is all because of the Blackbriar Curse ? I don 't know , but right now , I 'm willing to believe just about anything . I couldn 't get a shot off . I couldn 't help him , but you 're all right , though , right ? - It 's his own damn fault . - Thank goodness . When did you learn to shoot like that ? Well , when a fish tries to eat you ... Look out ! Trooper Simon ! Mr. Hardin , where is your wife ? No , she 's all right . She 's all right . She and Ashley went back to the wreck to try and ... No , that 's not good ! We 're rounding up the survivors , and we have to get them out of the swamp right now . Why ? What 's happening ? We 've got the snakeheads on the move . We have to make a " Hail Mary " play to clear them out , okay ? The Air Force has been called in . Your mom 's in danger ! Take it , it 'll help ! It 'll help ! - Thanks , Marge . - Take it ! Besides , I just got off the phone with the guys who created these fish . Apparently , there 's something worse that was on that truck than just these snakeheads . What do you mean , " worse " ? - You gotta be kidding , right ? - No . What is that ? I have no idea , but whatever it is , it 's a hell of a lot bigger than the others . What does that mean , " Specimen 0 " ? I don 't know . Let 's go to the other side . I never got to tell you how sorry I was about what happened to Bryce . And I want you to know that I 'll take care of Chris . I know that you will , Ashley , and thank you . Marguerite Boudreaux . - Ashley ! - Help me , Ranger Hardin ! Help me ! Ashley ! Stay with me ! Help me ! No , no , just stay with me ! Please , no ! Please help ! No , no , no , no ! Don 't leave me here , Ranger Hardin , please ! Help me ! Come on , let 's get you to cover . - You can do it . Good ? - Yeah . Okay , great . - It 's okay , you 're gonna be okay . - What is that ? Oh , God , it 's its eggs . Finish this off ! - Jim ? - Mom ! Chris ! Mom ! Where are you ? Are you with Ashley ? Yeah , we 're at the crash site . It 's past the 8-Mile Ditch . Ashley 's with me , she 's hurt . She needs a hospital . There is a monster here , it 's just the worst damn one yet . - All right , listen to me ! - Oh , my God ! That 's the mother ! She 's the original test specimen ! - She 's pregnant ! - It 's worse , she 's already laid her eggs . Ranger Hardin ! All right , the Air Force are on their way , the National Guard , to kill the rest of the fish . But the only way to stop the infestation ... - Go on , Chris , tell me . - They 're carpet-bombing the swamp , Ma . Oh , my God ! Chris , I love you . No ! I 'm coming to get you ! No , don 't ! We 're never gonna make it ! I 'm not gonna give up ! Now get down ! Okay , get down . Let 's go ! You ready ? Go ! Go ! Go ! I hate this damn swamp , anyway . The fire 's not working , she 's following us . It 's not to kill her , it 's to control her . We 're leading her somewhere . You mean , we 're the bait ? Hold on . Help Ashley . Let me have the gun . Ranger Hardin , move ! Let 's go ! Jim ! Jim ! - Come on . - We gotta get across the swamp ! I know , I think you 're right . Let 's go , Chris . Let 's go ! The bullets aren 't doing anything ! Go ! Jim , take this ! Marge ! Let 's go ! Marge ! Marge ! Let 's go ! Come on , Dad ! Ash , fire bomb . Chris , what are you doing ? Trust me . Chris , are you ready ? I think the curse has finally been broken . I think that I 've been hanging on to this a little too long . I thought maybe you might want it back .

 God , my life is very boring . You ... For what purpose do we live for ? Daruma-san has come ! Don 't move ! Don 't move ... If you move , you 'll die . Daruma-san ... has come ! God . Give me back my boring life . Daruma-san ... has come ! Da ... ru ... ma ... . My legs can 't take it anymore ! Just hang on ... How the hell are we going to get out of this ! ? Why ... Why did everyone have to die ! ? It 's all that thing 's fault ! Not only can it move , but it can also speak ! Hey , class pres ! Like hell I know ! Has come ! Hmm ? Tch ... . Then , let 's try to run out the door ! Why is it not opening ! ? Move it ! Has come ! Hmm ? Hmm ? Heh heh heh ... . No ... I don 't want to die ! Calm down ! Calm down . Anyways , what I do know is ... has come ! Hmm ! ? Hmm ! ? Tch ! Boring .. This " Daruma-san " ... represents a death game . As to what and why this event is happening ... Well , that 's the one thing I don 't understand . That game is very boring . If you want to steal it , go to the other side of the shelf . The cameras there are dead . Hey , I used to steal them too . You should start being calm and bold . But how do we get out of this place ? Take a look at Daruma-san 's back . Has come ! What 's with y 'all ... . Da ... . I don 't know what the rules are , but I think the game ends when you press that button . Ru ... ma ... . san ... . Alright ... Leave it to me ! Hey , wait ! Has come ! Heh ... Heh heh .. Da ... . What now ? Don 't panic . And don 't worry , guys . We still have time to do it slowly . There 's no time ! Huh ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Shun is right . Look at that . Has ... . That 's a timer ! What happens when it reaches 0 ? I really don 't want to say it , but everyone will probably die . Co ... . There 's one minute left . Me ! Heh heh ... . Da ... ru ... . Damn it ! Ma-san has come ! Please ! Stop this ... Come ! Come ! Come ! Forget it ... We 're screwed . Da ... . Then , I 'll send you flying . Huh ? Step on me and jump over this pile of corpses . What ? Still remember our lesson in P.E. ? That one . Wait , but ... san ... . Then come here ! Has ... . co ... . me ! Game over ! Game over ! Game over ! Hell yeah ! We did it ! The switch was pushed by Takahata Shun .. The switch was pushed by Takahata Shun .. Live ! Live ! What the hell is this ... Shun , still don 't feel like going to school ? Nah , I 'll go tomorrow . You 're always saying that but it 's been a month and you 're still not acting up . I already said " tomorrow " . A car near a building suddenly exploded . 16 nearby pedestrians died and 52 people that had injuries was rushed to a nearby hospital . It still hasn 't been confirmed if a Japanese was responsible . Local government considered it to be an act of anti-government groups though it is still being investigated on . Good morning , Shun . Y 'know ... Why aren 't you going out with her ? She lives next to ours so we 've always been together . So you really can 't say that I can have special feelings for her . Is that what you 're really thinking ? Don 't you want to be with her every time ? Yeah , yeah ... Another boring day ... Those guys sure are having fun . Reign of Louis XIV period ... French monarchy ushered in their time . He said , " I am the State called the Sun King " . Takahata . Yes ? You can continue your sleep . Alright , here 's what 's gonna appear in your test ... God . Give me back my boring life . You 're a mouse ... . Coming soon , it will ... . The cat is coming ... . Mouse ? The cat is coming ... . The cat is coming ? Ichika . Shun . Thank goodness ... you 're alive . What about the others ? I want to save everyone ... so I slip closely , bit by bit ... and pushed the switch ... but instead , I killed everyone ... It 's all my fault ... ! Then I 'm the same as you . Satake was ... Just what is going on ? I also don 't know ! I know ... Let 's contact the police . Eh ? Why ? You 're a mouse .. The cat 's coming soon .. It 's coming ! Let 's get out of here and contact the police ! It 's locked here , too ! Ichika , move aside ! Oh , this one 's open ! One , two ... ! Everyone ! It 's no use . Once you come in , you can 't get out . Ah . What is ... this ... Fit the cat 's bell ... for it ... to end . What does it mean ? Well , you two should change to your outfit , too . We don 't know what will happen if we don 't follow the rules . Hurry and get dressed . Hurry up and put it on ! The school president is ordering you ... The cat ... it 's here ! Someone ... ! We are being eaten ! Ichika ! C 'mon , stand up ! Shun , what 's that ? " Fit the cat 's bell for it to end " . Then , it means ... Over there ... We have to shoot the bell there . 9 minutes and 30 seconds left ? It 's impossible ! Everyone ! We have to shoot that bell ... over to that ring ... to end this game ! Alright , I can do it . Akimoto ! Pass ! We leave it to you ! Within 365 days a year , I have never been lazy to practice shooting 500 times a day even if I split my nails 30 times . As to why I 'm practicing basketball ... I now understand . Everything is for this moment ! It 's gonna get in ! Alright ! His hands can move , too ? Everyone , take off your clothes ! That thing only attacks those who wear the mouse outfit ! Hurry ! Take it off or you 'll be eaten ! With this ... we won 't be eaten anymore . Don 't fuck with me ! You 're the one who forced us to wear these fucking things ! I can 't be ... I 'm not to blame for all this ... You bastard ! You told us ... I see ! There 's no more mouse , so it switched to eating us instead ! Only 3 minutes left ... ? We 're running out of time ... ! I ... will die . Over here ! Over here . Shun ! Will someone ... shoot the bell ... while I distract its attention ! ? It 's already impossible ! Kikkawa 's dead , remember ! ? If this continues , then we 'll all die ! My back 's itchy . So itchy . Who ... So itchy . My back 's itchy so I can 't sleep , meow . Who will help scratch me , meow ? So , it 's this thing ... So itchy itchy . My back 's super itchy . It seems I 'm the only one who can hear it . Why ? Meow , meow . Meow , meow , meow . Meow . My back 's itchy . So I can 't sleep , meow . As I thought . Who will help scratch me , meow ? What 's wrong , Shun ! ? If you wear this dress , you become this thing 's meal . But at the same , you can understand what this thing 's saying . Okay ... How 's that ! ? Feeling good yet ! ? More . More . I want you to scratch me more , meow . More . Scratch me more , meow . More . More . More . More . Everyone ! Help me out here ! It 's pretty hard ! So itchy . So itchy . Who will help scratch me , meow ? More . More . Scratch me more , meow . More . More . Scratch me more , meow . - Ichika ! So good . We did it . Good , we have our chance . Wait a minute ! Don 't you think maybe it will be like that time with the Daruma ? That the only one who accomplished the task will live ? This time , we all put the cat to sleep and each have played their part . So I think we will all survive . Are you sure we will all survive ! ? That 's ... Then ... I 'll do it . Who the hell agrees with you ? I 'll do it . This time , it should be ladies first . Get off , you sow ! It 's gotta be me ! Let go ! Now 's not the time to fight with each other ! You 're saying that but you actually want to save your own skin , too ! Don 't lie to us ! Everyone , calm down ! If you don 't keep quiet , that thing will ... Get off me ! This is the student president 's order ! Using your position to save yourself , you 're no more than a bully ! That 's why ... I told you to hurry and give it to me ... If we fail to make it fall asleep again , then ... This is it ... We don 't have much time ... Then , what do we do ? Just how ... how will we do it ? Ichika , take the bell and come with me ! Over here ! Don 't let them escape ! So , one 's a bell and the other one 's a basketball , right ? Its eyes ? Having seen the structure of the bell with the possibility of going through the ring , the cat caught it . In other words , that thing will first need to see a confirmation if that is the bell . In this case , we need to delay its confirmation time . And the success rate is ... 50 % . Let 's see if you can guess which one 's the bell ! That idiot ! Not securing the cover enough ! Then the one with the bell is ... ! The real one is here ! It can 't be . Then letting it see the ball was ... Intentional . To make it think that I 'm the one holding the bell . Go inside ! It can 't ... God . Amaya ... Game over ... . We did it ... Not yet . It 's still too early to celebrate . This time , the ones who survived are ... Amaya Takeru . Takahata Shun . Akimoto Ichika . Alright , I know we can do it ! 3 people in all . Live . Live . What about the others ? This is God 's will . A world where the strong preys the weak . Those who survived are strong . Those who died are weak . I 've always dreamed of such a world . Thank you , God . You have my gratitude . This bastard ... is dangerous . Those who are incompetent are granted death , chosen by God as " unqualified " . Don 't you think like that , too ? Takahata Shun . I don 't think like that . You 're wrong . You and I are the same . How so ? I can tell from your smell . You perceive your life as boring like your time doesn 't flow . So in order to survive this life , we 're chosen . Cut the crap and just tell me what you mean ! Nice expression you 're having . You are also looking forward to this world . The same as me . You 're wrong . Shun and you aren 't the same . He 's more gentle ... and stronger ... That 's why you 're both completely different ! Is that right ? Stop ! New York . Washington . Moscow . Sydney . Madrid . London . All national high schools among them are experiencing some kind of terrorist attacks . We have some information saying that 10 million of our youth has died . Just now , a new report came in . The Prime Minister , from the Prime Minister 's official residence , has established an Emergency Countermeasures Headquarters and raising the national levels as " dangerous " . Just behind me , large cubes suddenly appeared all around the world . The reason is still unknown . It is believed that the students who survived are being held inside the cube . Right now , the police and self-defense forces are being deployed to implement the rescue operations . But they can 't find even a single entrance on the cube . The next cube appeared on Hokkaido and is being tracked by the Sato network . The current situation is ... Not again ... SDF also looks like there is no way on making it on the main road of the city ... Thank you , old man . And on the studio is a professor from the University studying human environment , Professor Okihira Tadakatsu . Mr. Okihira . These series of terrorist attacks and the appearance of the cubes , what do you think about ... This is not a terrorist attack . I have no doubt that this kind of level can only be done by aliens . The situation is beyond the scope of human cognition . Hey , hey . What the hell 's he saying ? But still ... Right now , the surviving students are being called " God 's children " on the internet because they can survive even in this situation . God 's children ... Takumi-chan ? I 'll put your dinner here , okay ? Umm , Takumi-chan ? You should come out and see me once in a while ... Shut up ! Go away , you hag ! God 's children ... God 's children ... God 's children ... God 's Children . Oww ... Are you okay , Takahata-kun ? I had a dream of a cat ... blowing smoke on my face ... Thank goodness . It 's been a while . Takase-san , why are you here ? Wait , where is " here " ? I only know what you also know . When I woke up , I 'm already here . I see . How many years has it been ? Counting from the first two days after I transferred ... It 's been 3 years . You look good . But I shouldn 't have said it in this situation ... Hey , Takahata-kun . Why is this happening to us ? Why do we have to experience this ? I also don 't know . But I 'm glad I saw you again . I 'm also happy meeting you again . Can 't you keep your talking down ? I 'm in the middle of analyzing the vector using Helmholtz Theorem on the attempt to escape from here . Come again ? That is Taira-kun from a private high school . And there 's Taoka-san from an all-girls ' high school . They 're both survivors of the " Daruma " and the " Maneki Neko " game . Taira ... Taoka and Takase ... Takahata ... Then the rooms are being occupied by those that have the same first letters of their surnames . Seems that way . By being here with me , this proves that it 's not according to IQ , but ... You 're starting to get on my nerves ! What 's wrong ? Then it means Akimoto is in another room . Wait here for a moment , I 'm gonna check on ... Dammit , not again ... ! Someone ... can anybody hear me ? Anyone ! ? It would be best if you stop what you 're doing . Suddenly appeared all over the world ... all national high schools ... meanwhile a barrage of terrorist attacks ... This is not a terrorist attack ... occurring simultaneously throughout the world ... The Prime Minister , from the Prime Minister 's official residence ... can only be done by aliens ... and raising the national levels as " dangerous " ... this is what we should now be ... Nobody can save us . The SDF can 't even enter the cube to rescue us . Then what should we do ? Isn 't it obvious ? We 'll just have to wait . For the next game to start . Do we still need to play these games ? We need to , unless you have a plan . This is why I can 't tolerate you idiots . The surviving students are being called " God 's children " online ... God 's children ... Has a nice ring to it . " God 's children " ... Find the key and open the door for the game to end . Here it comes . Let 's ... play ... together . Taira-kun , let 's play together . Very well . What are we gonna play ? The name of the game we 'll play is called " Kagome Kagome " . After the end of the song , you 'll need to guess who 's behind you within 10 seconds . You have to blindfold your eyes , though . No cheating ! This is gonna be fun . Well then , let the game begin .. Ready , set ... ! Kagome Kagome . The bird in the cage . When , oh when will it come out . In the night of dawn . The crane and turtle slipped . Who is behind you now ? It 's Akemi ! Wrong ! It 's unfortunate , but I 'm Hanako . Bye-bye . Wait ... Well then , who 's next ? Let 's see , let 's see . Taoka-san , let 's play together . I ... I don 't want to play ! What 's up with that ? So boring . Then , can we kill you ? That 's right . A-Alright , I 'll play . I 'll play . We don 't really mind .. It 's alright if you don 't want to play .. Not at all . I 'm really looking forward to it . Do you really want to play that badly ? Then there 's no helping it . Then let 's play .. Kagome Kagome . The bird in the cage . When , oh when will it come out ? In the night of dawn . The crane and turtle slipped . Who is behind you now ? It 's ... It 's ... Time 's up .. No ! Stop ! Now then , who 's next ? Takase-san . Let 's play together . I want to switch with her . Let 's just get this over with . Good , good . Now isn 't this good ? Does this guy thinks that he can live ? Idiot are idiots .. Takahata-kun . Then let the game begin . Ready , set ... ! Kagome Kagome . The bird in the cage . When , oh when will it come out ? - Listen carefully . In the night of dawn . - Listen carefully . The crane and turtle slipped . Who is behind you now ? Okay , time 's up . The one behind you is ... It 's Kenichi ! The one behind me ... is Kenichi ! But your time 's up , so you 're out . No , I 'm still safe . Yes , it seems so .. What are you saying ? His time is up , isn 't it ? It 's because of this . Time 's up . I recorded it when Taoka-san 's the one playing . Time 's up . Your manner of saying " Time 's up " is odd so I can easily know it 's your voice . By recording your voice and mastering your arrangements , I can know who 's the one behind me . The one behind you is ... You 're the idiot one . Takahata-kun ! Thank goodness ... Thanks for saving me . Give me your hand ! Your hand ! I 'm getting lonely here ! If you don 't have any friends , then play with me . Hold each other 's hands ! So , y 'all are friends , huh .. That 's nice . So nice ! Tch ! We 're safe . If we have someone to hold hands with , then that thing won 't attack us . Takahata-kun . My hand ... Please don 't let go of my hand . I definitely won 't . Want to do it ? Pretty fun , isn 't it ? No ! Let 's go ! Ichika ! Shun ! Tch ! I 'm so lonely . Thank goodness . Barely made it . Thanks . Where 's Amaya ? I don 't know . We were in the same room , but he beat up those Kokeshi . He 's also got the key and ran off . Shouko . It 's been a while . Koutarou ! What is this ? Is this , perhaps ... Insert the seven keys with seven people then turn it simultaneously to open the door .. Hey , how many are you ? Only 4 people . So we still need one more , eh . What 's going on ? It seems we need seven people and must have all seven keys or else we won 't be able to move forward . How many keys do you have ? We have 2 . We also have 2 . So we still need 3 more keys and one more person otherwise , there 's no way to open the door ? Now , wait a minute . What if no one comes ? Then you already know what will happen to us , right ! ? 2 minutes left ! In the mean time , let 's try to find the other keys ! It 's impossible anymore . With only 2 minutes left to collect 3 more keys ... Amaya ... Awesome ! With this , we can get out . But we only need one more person . That 's not a problem . I only need him to avoid being killed by the Kokeshi . He 's useless anymore . Hey ... Do you know him ? I 'm not fine being with this killer . We 're friends , right , Takahata-kun ? Hurry up and let 's go ! - I know ! Let 's go , Amaya . One , two ... ! Game over ! Takahata Shun .. Akimoto Ichika .. Amaya Takeru .. Ouku Eiji .. Maeda Koutarou .. Sanada Yukio .. Takase Shouko .. 7 people in all .. Live .. Live .. Put on your clothes .. Live .. Live .. Why are our clothes here ? Come . Here . Come over here . Like I said , I 'm here where I can see the video . You failed to enter the cube , right ? Hurry and contact the media ! The aliens are coming ! God 's children ... God 's children ... God 's children ... Where are we ? Ice . What is it ... this time ? Welcome . I like white . Most especially pure white . Wha ... What ? I hate black-hearted people . So don 't ever lie to me . Just tell me the absolute truth , okay . What do you mean ? It 's very simple . From now on , you 're going to honestly answer my questions . If everyone says the truth , then the game ends . But if someone lied , then pick one person as a sacrifice . Remember that . Sacrifice ? Well then , here 's the first question ... . What is ... your favorite food ? That 's it ? I thought it was a difficult question , but it seems we can easily win this , right ? My favorite food is sushi . I like ramen . Meat . Parsley . Curry . Omelet rice . Milk crepes . I said don 't lie ! Who 's the liar ! ? If you don 't surrender the liar within 2 minutes , then I 'll kill everyone ! 2 minutes left . 2 minutes left . Who lied ? Come forward at once ! Maybe it 's you . Like hell it 's me . What I said is true . Then where 's your evidence ? What do you mean , " evidence " ? You do know that we can 't find one here , remember ! ? What with that eyes ? Sanada , do you have evidence yourself ? I 'd want to see it . I 'm cool . Isn 't the most suspicious one this goody high school student ? I know he likes to eat curry . Even the omelet rice . I can even eat 3 meals a day with it , no problem . You 're the one who 's lying , right ? What ? 1 minute left . 59 . 58 . 57 . 56 . 55 . This is the end . We 're out of time ! Why ... You said that you like parsley , right ? Yeah . Right ? Yeah . Right ? Right ! ? The food you like is definitely the most suspicious ! Everyone 's tastes differ , doesn 't it ! ? Stop it . You 're the suspicious one ! It is true . What ? Time is running out , yo . So , who 's the liar ! ? What ! ? It 's you ! It 's him . You 're wrong ... It 's not me ... I really ... ! Like eating parsley ... Liars will have the same fate so be careful , okay ? Then on to the next question . Do I ... like Takahata Shun ? Yes or no ? No ! No . Well , I know it 's just for a little while , but ... Yes . Then what do the girls think ? Well , we 're childhood friends ... and I have some feelings for him ... so if I have to choose ... then yes . We-well ... it can 't be helped since we 're in this kind of situation ... Same for me ... yes . You 're pretty popular ... aren 't you , kid ? So , what about you ? As for me ... No . I never liked myself . You guys ! Someone lied again ! Who 's the liar ! ? 2 minutes left . 2 minutes left . Who is it this time ! ? Stop it already ! Maybe ... it 's you . You want to kill us before , but now you said that you liked Shun . Isn 't it odd ? Kill and love are the same for me . Takahata-kun . Maybe it 's you who lied ? Because ... saying you dislike yourself ... maybe it 's different now ? Say something . It really is odd . In the first place ... everyone should be obviously saved if we just answered honestly . But still , someone lied . For what purpose is that person lying ? So you 've noticed , huh ? That 's because one of our comrades are among you .. Putting on a human outfit in order to kill you all by lying . If you don 't find the traitor , then everyone will die . I really hate it . Those black-hearted ones . I like white . Someone among us is the enemy 's comrade . 1 minute left . 59 . 58 . There 's no more time . Wait . Now that you think about it , the answer is simple . What ? Eiji and I are from a different school , so we don 't know Shun . But Takahata-kun , Ichika-san , and Amaya-kun are going in the same high school so they must 've known each other . Then it means , the one who doesn 't have an alibi is ... No , it 's ... That 's right ! You don 't know anyone in here . You 're wrong ! I didn 't lie ! We both are in the same school . There 's no way she 's the enemy 's comrade ! It 's even more suspicious because there 's no way something like that happened . What ! ? It 's a trap , isn 't it ? I believe in Takase . Don 't be fooled by her beauty . 15 . 14 . 13 . If you don 't hurry , then everyone will die . Find the spy . Do you understand ? 10 . 9 . 8 . 7 . 6 . 5 . This one 's the liar ! Stop it ! I said stop it ! Stop ! I didn 't lie ! I really ... like Takahata-kun . Don 't let go of my hand . It 's a shame . She was really a human . Then , on to the next question . Wait a moment there ! What is it ? Stopping me at the bast part , too ... . I know now . The one who 's lying all this time ... I know now . So , you 've finally noticed . Who is it ? The true liar is ... You ! But I already knew that from the get-go ... What do you mean ? The game is a farce right from the start . Making us believe that there is a traitor among us . Takase ... Takase 's blood ... revealed the truth . You 're not a pure white bear . So you saw it ! Takahata ! Hot ! Hot ! So hot ! I 'm burning to death . So the clearance is when I tell you the truth . You 're not a pure white bear . You 're a cruel black-hearted bear . A devil bear . Game over ! Takahata Shun .. Amaya Takeru . Akimoto Ichika .. Ouku Eiji . Maeda Koutarou .. 5 people in all .. Live . Live .. Please , stop running ! I wonder what will happen next ... Probably ... A game with " Ma " as the first syllable in its title . " Ma " ? So you didn 't notice ? All this is part of a " Word chain " game . " Word chain " ? Yes , a " Word chain " . First , there 's the " Daruma " . Next is the " Maneki Neko " . " Ko " ... " Kokeshi " ... and then the " Shirou Kuma " . That 's right . Yes . So the next game must have a " Ma " as its starting syllable ... for example ... " Matryoshka " . I 'm glad you all have come this far . This is the last stage . Let 's play happily to the end , okay ? So , this is the last ... What do you want to play this time ? The last one is ... ! " Kick the can for it to end " . Kick the can ? Yes . The rules are simple .. The chosen " demon " will first have to get the can up there and put it in the designated place .. Within this time , everyone should hide from the " demon " .. After the " demon " sets the can down , he will have to search those who 're hiding .. If he found someone and saw their face , he will have to shout their name and step on the can .. With this , the " demon " has already caught one person .. Those who are captured will be held inside this prison cell .. But if someone kicked the jar before the " demon " did , they everyone will be saved .. But the can will explode once it 's been kicked . That 's why in return for saving everyone , the kicker would have to sacrifice himself .. Interesting , isn 't it ? The game will end if the last hidden person kicked the can or if the " demon " caught three or more people .. So if someone kicked the can , that someone will die ... A " Kick-the-can " death game , huh . Don 't be like that . We 're here to have fun . Fun ! So , who 's gonna be the " demon " ? These sticks will decide ! One , two ... ! I 'm the " demon " . This is not good ... Of all things , it 's gonna be this guy ... The time limit will be until the sun sets .. Alright ... . Game start ! This way ! Judging from the position of the can , that guy will be having a hard time getting it . We have to run as far as we can . Let 's go ! Amazing ! We should be fine here . There 's about one hour till the sun sets . Before that 'll happen , he 'll have a hard time finding us . Piece of cake . No ... We 're screwed ... What are your names again ? Dammit ! Eh ... What was it again ? Ah , I remember . Ouku-kun and Koutarou-kun . Captured . As I thought , that guy 's extraordinary . Just now ... His eyes met mine ... Okay . We can do it . Hurry ! You go on ahead ! Hey , Ichika ! Ichika ! Akimoto Ichika , captured . This is the end for us . Takahata-kun won 't sacrifice himself to save us . I don 't think he can win against Amaya . Dammit ! When the sun sets , we 're finished . What should I do ? Why should I ... Takahata ! Can you hear me ! ? I caught 3 people ! With this , I can survive ! So I don 't need to capture you ! So rest assured and come out ! After the time ends , we 'll both live ! Live ... We are chosen by God to live in this new world ! This new world ... You are also looking forward to this world . The same as me . I ... I ... Shun ! Hear me out ! I really ... hate what this guy is saying ! It doesn 't matter what everyone says ... ! Even if it 's for the best or not ... ! Because even I don 't want to understand it ! I don 't want to see your face ever again ! That 's why ... Don 't you dare come out ! Don 't ever believe what this guy is saying ! Just hide as far as you can ! Do you understand ! ? Ichika ... Shun and you aren 't the same . He 's more gentle ... and stronger ... That 's why you 're both completely different ! Takahata ! We 're friends , right ! ? The game will end soon ! Believe in me and come out here ! I understand ! I 'm coming out now ! Shun , don 't be fooled ! Sorry to keep you waiting , Amaya ! As I recall , you can 't shout my name if you can 't see my face ! That idiot ... What is he thinking ... ? It 's true that he cannot see Shun 's face and he has the chance to kick the can unscathed . But ... Amaya can easily remove his mask . Takahata-kun , what is that ? Come , Amaya . I 'll be your opponent ... ! What 's wrong ? Don 't you want to be my opponent anymore ? Shun ! Run ! Wearing an armor is a bad idea , you know . Takahata-kun , captured . It 's like you said , Amaya . Even now , I still think my life is boring . I thought it was better if everything just disappear ! I even joked to God about wishing it , but I didn 't expect this to happen . Not treasuring what life I have , I 'm a fool . Only realizing this now that I lost everything I have , I really am a fool ! We 're alive right now . Forgetting to treasure and realize that each boring day is the best ! I 'm sorry , Amaya . I 'm not like you . That 's okay . I don 't intend to help you from the start . Even if you 're resisting , as soon as I step on that can , you 'll surely lose ! I wonder about that . I didn 't just wear this armor to hide my face nor to protect myself from the explosion . The reason for it is this ! Shun . That 's enough ... Stop already ... ! Shun ! Satake ... and Shouko-chan , too ... There are still many things I want to talk about with them ... But still ... why ... did God let them to die ? If this world really is created according to God 's will , then ... To hell ... with you ! Shun ! No ! Takahata ! It 's going to explode ! Huh ? Game over . Because Takahata Shun rescued all the captives , Amaya Takeru 's number of captives is 0 .. Therefore , you 're out ! Akimoto Ichika . Ouku Eiji .. Maeda Koutarou . And Takahata Shun .. You guys win ! We did it . It 's a bit unclear , but ... We survived ? We won ? But why didn 't it explode ? Oh , that ? That 's a lie . Huh ! ? Because it made the game more interesting , right ? Don 't fuck with me ! I am chosen by God . I can 't die here ! Eh ? What do you mean " die " ? From the start , we only want to play with you all . No one said anything about dying . Ha ha ha ! Seriously ... ? Then that means ... Everyone . I congratulate you for coming this far . Then we 're ... We 're really gonna live , right ? Finally . This is your reward , everyone . You can get out once you 've finished eating . It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? Hey , Ichika . After we get out , let 's go eat delicious foods together . And let 's see the movies together . Yeah . And then ... I still want to do many things with you . Ah . You can also help me and mom clean the storage room . Do it on your own . I can 't really remember my dad . He 's probably training right now , but even so , it may not be that bad . This is good ! Alright , I 'm lucky ! Look , Ichika ... What 's up ? Sorry , Shun . I ... really can 't go to the movies with you . " You live " Everyone . In order to get this far , you need " Intelligence " . " Endurance " . " Imagination " . Having all these abilities let you go as far as here . But , there is one more . Finally , there is one more thing you need to possess . And that 's ... . " Luck " ? Shun . I may really have ... liked you a bit . " You die " Bye-bye . " You live " " Luck " ! Ichika ! What the hell is this ... Why is this happening ... Takahata Shun .. Amaya Takeru .. Live . Live .. The cube has now descended ! And the surviving students finally appeared ! Takumi-chan ? I 'll put your food here . I 'm going out for a bit . Go ? Go where ! ? I 'm going to save the world . Don 't come home too late , okay ? God 's children ... There is no God . That 's ... wrong , you know ? There 's " Daruma " , " Maneki Neko " , " Kokeshi " , " Shirou Kuma " , " Matryoshka " , and God .

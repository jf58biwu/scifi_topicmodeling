 New York City the future . A dark desolate world . World in war suffering loss .. .. On both sides . Mutants and the humans who dared help them fighting an enemy we can not defeat . Are we destined on this path ? Destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us ? Or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves ? Change our fate ? Is the future truly set ? They are here ! Time 's-up ! Sentinel ! Sunspot . Let 's go ! Blink ! No ! It 's too late assholes ! Come here ! Get your hands up ! - Get down ! - No ! No ! So few of us left . Professor . We found them . Professor . - Bobby . - Hi storm . Hey kid . Professor . You made it . Whenever the sentinels attack warpath spots them . And I sent bishop back to warn us of the attack ... Before it happens . Blink scouts the next side and .. .. Well then we leave before they ever know we were there . Because we never were . What do you mean you 've never there ? She projects bishop back in time few days ... To warn the others of the coming attack . She sends bishop back in time ? No just his consciousness in to his younger-self into his younger body . Wow ! This not just work Charles . What might works ? The sentinel program was originally conceived by Dr. bolivar trask . In the early 70s he was one of the world leading weapons designers . But covertly he had began experimenting only mutants . Using their gifts to fuel his own research . There was one mutant who had discovered what he was doing . Mutant with ability to transform herself to anyone . Mystique . I knew her as raven . We met when we were children grow up together . She was like a sister to me . I tried to help her . But only succeeded in driving her away . She hunted trask across the world . And at the Paris peace of accords in 1973 after the Vietnam war . She found trask and killed him . It was the first time she killed him . Wasn 't no last . But killing trask did not have the outcome she expected . It only persuaded the government the need for his program . They captured her that day . Tortured her and experimented on her . In her DNA they discovered the secret to her power of transformation it gave them the key they needed to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant 's power . And less than 50 years the machines were destroyed so many of our kind were created . And it all started that day in 1973 the day she first killed the day she truly became mystique . Do you wanna go back there ? If I can get to her stop the assassination keep her out of their hands and we can stop the sentinels ever been borne . And end this war before it ever begins . I can send someone back in couple of weeks . Maybe a month but you 're talking about going back decades . You have the most powerful brain the world professor . But the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps . It will rip you apart . I 'm sorry . No one can survive that trip . What if someone 's mind has a way of sniping back . What if someone can heal as faster as rip apart . Okay spread out . Take you position . So I wake up in the my younger body god knows where then what ? You need to go to my house and find me convince me all of this . Wouldn 't you just be able to read my mind ? I didn 't have my powers in 1973 . Logan you have to do for me what I once did for you lead me guide me . I was a very difference man then . You have to be patient with me . Patience isn 't my strongest suit . You 're need me as well . What ? After mystique left Charles she came with me and I set her on a dangerous path . Darker path . It 's going to take the two of us side by side at a time when we couldn 't be further apart . Great . So where do I find you ? Oh .. Its complicated . Basically your body goes to sleep only your mind travels back in time . As long as you back there past and present will continue to coexist . But once you wake up ... . .. Whatever you 've done will take hold and become history . And for the rest of us that will be the only history that we know . That will be like last 50 years never happened . This world this war . The only person who 'll remember it ... is you . Alright Logan I need you to clear your head and stay as calm as possible . What do you mean ? If your mind gets rocky it will harder for me to hold you . You could start to slip between past and future . What I need to get a little rocky ? Think peaceful thoughts . Peaceful thoughts . Do you have any good news ? Well you don 't really age so you 'll pretty much look the same . You don 't have much time in past . Sentinels will find us they always do . And this time we won 't be able to run or have no escape . This is our last chance . Do you really think this will work ? I have faith in him . It 's not him I 'm worried about . It 's us . We were young . We didn 't know any better . We will now . See you soon . It might sting a little . Holy shit ! It worked . Hey what 's going on ? - Gwen ! Get dressed ! - Who are you ? Hey I don 't know what 's going on . What 's going on is you supposed to guard your boss 's daughter not screwing her . I didn 't sleep with her . - No ? - No . I mean yes I slept with her many times but ... Jimmy ! That wasn 't me . That was old me . - I just got here like 20 seconds ago . - Really ? - Yeah . - What happen to your cloths ? No ... Oh .. Will you believe me if I told you I 've sent here from the future ? - Get out of here sweetheart . - Yeah we 'll take care of this comedian . No you not . You gonna give me the keys of your car and money for gas or you gonna wake up in a hospital . Trust me I know how these things pay out . - Because you from the future ? - No ... because of these . What the hell ! Ahhh ... Damn it . Peaceful thoughts . We are reviewing all of our defense expenditures and all the black books are being opened . We can 't support a weapon that targets our own citizens if these mutants as you described already living among us then they are living here peacefully . We haven 't had an incident in over 10 years . After what happened in Cuba ? It was never confirmed . We have real enemies out there . Russians the Chinese . We 're talking about 10 of 10 of the 10 of our population . - Allow me to read something to you . - Please . This was acquired by our friends at the CIA . Its in a dissertation written by a mutant at Oxford university . And I quote . To homo-neanderthals his a mutant cousin of homo saphiens which is us . Was an aberration the arrival of mutated human species : Homo saphiens . Was followed by the immediate extinction of the their less evolve kin . Well now .. We are the neanderthals . Speak for yourself Dr .. Trask . You know when you send our soldiers to Vietnam without the weapon they needed to win the war you underestimated your enemy . You hah you do that with this enemy it won 't be some border skirmish halfway around the world . This time the war will be for our streets our cities our homes . And by the time you see the need for my program it will be too late . And you will have lost two wars in one life time . We 're sorry Dr .. Trask . But your sentinel program it ain 't gonna fly . Can I help you colonel ? Just here to give my boys to proper send off . I 'm sorry sir . But we have orders . This is a quarantined area . Stand a side soldier . That 's an order . Attention . At ease . What is all this ? Lab reports blood tests . All are getting packed up and send back . Where is it going ? Same place as they are . Trask industries . Lets go gentleman taking you out of this shit show . Shipping home ? Not just yet . What do you doing with those ? Its only make the ride little smoother . We are transferring you to a private facility where we can .. Run a few more tests . Your men are not military . Private outfit . We 're authorized to command these men . These troops are going home . Well colonel ... I don 't believe you have the jurisdiction in this matter . I 'm afraid I do it son . I 'm sorry who are you ? The question is major . Who are you ? Raven . That 's not my name . - I had him . - I know . Let 's move out . Com-on let 's go . Where 's Erik ? I 'm on my own now . Let 's go . Move it . Hold that plane ! I wanna leave these boys in this godforsaken country let 's go . You 're not coming with us are you ? My war is not over . The enemy is still out there . Where did they go ? Four cadets where they go ? They went over there . Private property keep out Xavier 's school can I help you ? Ahh yeah what happened to the school ? School has been shut for years . Are you a parent ? Sure as hell hope not . - Who are you ? - I 'm Hank . I and maccoy look after the house now . You are beast ? Look at you guess you are a late bloomer . I do not know what you 're talking about . I 'm gonna have to ask you to leave . - Where is the professor ? - There is no professor here . You 're pretty strong for a scrawny kid . Sure there is no beast thing here ? - Come on beast . - Beast is not here . - Come on beasty . - Go ! Hey ! I said the school is closed . You need to leave . Not until I see the professor . There is no professor here . I told you that . Look kid . You and I gonna be good friends . You just don 't know what yet . Professor ! Ahhh ... .. Professor ! Hank what 's going on here ? - Professor . - Please do not call me that . Do you know this guy ? Yeah he looks slightly familiar get off the bloody chandelier Hank . You can walk . You 're a perceptive one . I thought Erik .. What you saying managed to miss our sign on the way in this is private property my friend I 'm gonna ask him to ask you to leave . Well I 'm afraid I can 't do that because ... .. Because I was sent here for you well tell whoever it was that sent you that I 'm busy . This gonna be a little tricky because the person who sent me .. Was you . - What ? - About 50 years from now . 50 years from now like in the future 50 years from now . Yeah . - I sent you from the future . - Yeah . Piss off . If you had your powers you know I was telling the truth . How do you know I don 't have my ... .. - Who are you ? - I told you . - You are CIA ? - No . You were watching me . I know you Charles . We 've been friends for years . I know your powers came when you were 9 . I know you thought you were going crazy when it started all the voices in your head . And it wasn 't until you were 12 that you realized all the voices were in everyone else 's head . Do you want me to go on ? I never told that anyone . Not yet no but you 'll . Alright you 've picked my interest what do you want ? We have to stop raven . I need your help . We need your help . Think I 'd like to wake up now . What does she have to do with this ? So you 're saying that they took raven 's power and what ? They weaponized it ? Yep she is unique . Yes she is . In the beginning the sentinels were just targeting mutants . Then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants . Who would eventually have mutant children or grandchildren many of the humans tried to help us it was a slaughter leaving only the worst of humanity in charge but then it went worse . I 've never seen anything like this . And it all starts with her . Let 's just say that for the sake of sake that I choose to believe you that I choose to help you . Raven won 't listen to me . No her heart and soul belongs to someone else now . I know . That 's why we gonna need Magneto too . Erik ? You do know where he is ? Yeah . He 's where he belongs . So that 's it you 're just gonna walk out ? Oh top marks like I said you are perceptive . The professor I know would never turn his back .. on someone who lost their path especially someone he loved . You know .. I think I do remember you now . Yeah we came to you a long time ago seeking your help . And I 'm gonna say to you what you said to us then fuck off ! Listen to me you little shit I 've come a long way and I watched a lot of people die good people friends . If you 're gonna wallow in self pity and do nothing then you 're gonna watch the same thing you understand ? We all have to die some time . I told you there is no professor here . What the hell happened to him ? He lost everything . Erik , raven , his legs . The school allowed us this whole place just after the first semester the war in Vietnam got worse . Many of the teachers and students were drafted . It really broke him . He retreated into himself .. I wanted to help do something so .. So I designed a serum to treat his spine derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation . I take just enough to keep myself balanced but he takes too much . I tried easing him back but he just couldn 't bear the pain voices .. The treatment gives him him his legs but it 's not enough he 's .. He 's just lost too much . You 're not scare to me ? I always believed I couldn 't be the only one in the world . Charles Xavier . Raven . You 're hungry and alone ? Take whatever you want . We got lots of food you don 't have to steal . . In-fact you never have to steal again . And that 's a promise . I hope you get her . But not for any of your future shots but for her . Fare enough . I 'm telling you this you do not know Erik . The man is a monster . A murderer . You think you can convince raven to change ? To come home ? Splendid . But what makes you think you can change the him ? Because you and Erik sent me here back together . The room they 're holding him in was built during the 2nd world war when there was a shortage of steel so the foundation is pure concrete and sand no metal . And he 's being held a 100 floors beneath the most heavily guarded building on the planet . Why is he in there ? What he forgot to mention ? Ahhh jfk . He killed him ? What else would explain the bullet miraculously curving through the air Eric 's always had a way with guns . Are you sure you want to carry on with this ? This is your plan not mine . We don 't have any resources to get us in or out it 's just me and Hank . I know a guy . Yeah he 'd be a young man now grew up outside of DC he could get into anywhere just don 't know how the hell we 're gonna find him history provided the question we have a phone book I thought you 'd be getting ready for your trip sir . I just came to grab couple of files . Is that a new scarf ? It 's nice . Thank you . Autopsy reports Dr. trask . One second . We added some names to the Paris meeting thank you . Is there something wrong sir ? No . It 's nothing . Would you mind typing up my itinerary . I don 't wanna miss anything . What has he done now ? I 'll just write you a check for whatever he took . We just need talk to him . Peter the cops are here .. .. Again . Guess what I didn 't do anything I 've been here all day . Just relax Peter we are not cops . Of course you 're not cops if you were cops you wouldn 't drive a rental car how 'd you know we got a rental car ? I checked your registration when you were walking through the door I also had some time to kill so I went through your rental agreements saw you were from out of town are you FBI ? No you 're not cops hey what 's up with this kid 's school place that 's an old card . He is fascinating he is a pain in the ass . What teleporter ? No he 's just fast . When I know him he was so old . Young . Young ? You 're just old . So you 're not afraid to show your powers ? Power ? What power ? What you talking about ? You see some strange here ? Nothing anybody believe if you told them . So who are you ? What do you want ? We need your help Peter . What ? Break into a highly secured facility and get someone out . Prison break ? That 's illegal you know . Well only if you get caught . What 's there in for me ? You the kleptomaniac get to break into the Pentagon . How do I know I can trust you ? Because we are just like you . Show him . It 's cool just disgusting built in 1943 the Pentagon is the world largest office building . Housing more than 25000 military and police stretched over 6 million square feet .

We have to get in to the 3rd floor oh I 'm sorry you want to finish ? They told me you can control the metal . They ? You know my mom once knew a guy who could do that . Sorry I 'm just not very good with violence . Charles . Good to see you too old friend . - And walking ? - Not thanks to you . You 're the last person in the world I expected to see today .

Peter ... Take it slowly . Where did they dig you up ? You 're gonna find this hard to believe but ahh .. You sent me . You and Charles from the future . How did you lose them ? The treatment for my spine fixed my DNA . You sacrificed your powers that you could walk ? I sacrificed my power so that I could St .. What do you know about it ? I lost my fair share hah . Dry your eyes Erik . It doesn 't justify what you 've done . You 've no idea what I have done . I know that you took the things that mean most to me . Well maybe you should have fought harder for them . Do you want to fight Erik ? I 'll give you a fight ! - Let him come . - You abandoned me ! You took her away and you abandoned me ! Angel .

A beautiful girl interested in politics ... Appearances can be deceiving . Fancy a game ? It 's been a while . I 'm not in emotion for a game . Haven 't had a real sip in 10 years . I didn 't kill the president . Bullet curved Erik . Because I was trying to save him . They took me out before I could . - Why would you trying to save him ? - Because he was one of us . You must think me so foolish . We always said they would come after us . I never imagined they would use raven 's DNA to do it . When did you last see her ? The day I left to Dallas . And how is she ? Strong . Driven - loyal . - How .. How was she ? She was .. I could see why she had so much talent . You should be proud of her Charles . She is out there fighting for our cause . Your cause . The girl I knew she was not capable of killing . You didn 't raise her you grew up with her . She couldn 't stay a little girl forever that 's why she left she left because you got inside her head that 's not my power . She made a choice . But now we know where that choice leads don 't we ? She 's going to murder trask they 're going to capture her and then they 're going to wipe us out . Not if we get to her first . Not if we change history tomorrow . I 'm sorry Charles . For what happened I truly am it 's been a while since I played I 'll go easy on you . Might finally get a fair fight . You make the first move . The diplomats from all around the world arriving here today at the hotel royale . It 's a historic day as the official ending of the United States fierce involvement in Vietnam . There 's the south vietnamese foreign minister with other south vietnamese dignitaries the summit doesn 't begin for another hour the hotel has arranged a private room upstairs for you special quest that 'll be fine . Good afternoon everyone hello . Thank you for coming . Congratulations on winning this war . Now I know you all have hands to shake and photos to take downstairs so I will get right to the point . There is a new enemy out there . An enemy that will render your arsenals useless your armies powerless and your nations defenseless . You 'll need a new weapon for this war . I call them " sentinels " . Named after the ancient guardians that stood at the gates of the citadel . They have the aeronautic capabilities of a harrier jet . Armed with guns that can fire off more than 2000 rounds per minute with thermo-ceramic ammunition . But size power speed you can find that at lockheed above . No what makes the sentinels so special ? Is the ability to target the mutant x gene ? The genetic guidance system that can lock onto a mark half a mile away . And won 't trigger unless it has identified the target . With this weapon there 'll be no human collateral damage . If I turn it on the system couldn 't even activate in here . Unless there 's a mutant . There has to be some kind of mistake . My machine don 't make mistakes . What are you ? I assure you I .. No.Don 't shoot him . I assure you . Do not arrest him . I do not know what you 're talking about . Raven ! Raven . Raven ! Raven . Charles . We 've come for you . Erik and I. Together . I never thought I could see you again . I made you a promise long time ago that I would protect you . I didn 't . And I know ... Wolverine ! I 'm going to keep you safe I 'm going to keep you out of their hands Erik . Erik . What are you doing ? Securing our future . Forgive me mystique . Ss long as you 're out there we 'll never be safe . Erik . Use your powers Charles . Stop him . He can 't . He is slipping . He is slipping back . I 'm loosing him . Striker ! This is where you started as Wolverine okay ? Kitty ! Restrain him . Erik ! Where am I ? Ahh . How the hell did I get here ? What ? You came to us . - Who are you ? - Charles . Charles Xavier . - I do not know you . - Ahh ? What the hell is that ? Wow ho I can deal with this . Just go . Stop Erik . Erik . I 'm sorry . Erik . You are Logan . That 's Hank McCoy . I 'm Charles Xavier . You spent the last couple of days with us . You 're on acid ? Somebody gave you really bad acid . Yeah ? Just hold on tight we 'll get through this together . - Oh god ! - Kitty . She is wounded pretty bad . I got him . Professor . What happened to you ? I just saw someone who 's going to bring me a lot of pain someday . Where is raven ? Gone . - What ? - We have to get out of here . Yesterday the Paris peace summit was rocked by the appearance of unidentified assailants . The likes of which the world has never seen . Mass hysteria has gripped the nation as people ask where did they come from ? Will they 'd be back ? And most importantly are they friend or foe ? That was one in corresponding to the earlier reporting from the Paris peace summit yesterday . What the hell are we dealing with here ? Off the record . Two days ago this man Erick lehnsherr escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon . We believe that this woman is a former associate of lehnsherr 's . They were together in Cuba the day of the crisis in 1962 . Hs was also linked to the Kennedy assassination . What about that thing ? We do not know what that thing is sir . Actually we really don 't know what any of them are . Yes . Yes we do . They are mutants . He ​ ​ has the power to control metal . Last I checked that 's what most of your weapons were made of . And she can transform into anyone . A general . A secret service man . Even you Mr. president . She can walk into this office and order a nuclear strike if she was in the mood . And that 's only two of them . Well do we have any countermeasures any defense ? I was waiting for you to ask me that question . That 's an experimental program sir . Strictly off the books . You 're telling me these mutants are out in the world and our best defense are these giant metal robots ? Many of the mutants looks like us . My sentinels can tell the difference . I have 8 prototypes ready to go they 're built out of a space age polymer not an ounce of metal on them . I wanna make a demonstration I want the world to know that we can protect them . What do you need to get these things operational ? I already gave that number to congress unfortunately they elected to shut me down . It 's going to cost a bit more to turn them on . Whatever you need . Oh and one more thing if we do manage to capture them I would like her for research purposes of course . How terrible ? What ? I mean , to be like that ? Like that ? Can you imagine ? How can she even look in the mirror ? Yes , I can . From where did she com from ? You think she has any family ? Yes she does . If I see so much as a screw I 'll jam this into your throat . How did you find me ? You taught me well . It 's been a long time since we were this close . I miss you . You tried to kill me . So the rest of us could live . What do you mean ? I received a message from the future . Don 't lie to me . I never have I never will . Humans use your blood your genes to create a weapon that wipes us all out . I was only doing what I thought necessary to secure our future . So what 's to stop me from killing you right now and securing my future ? Nothing . It doesn 't matter anymore . They have your DNA your blood was on the street . Whose fault is that ? Mine . I 've seen their plans . They are creating a weapon and now they have what they need to take it further . We have to strike now while we have a chance while we still hold the upper hand . I 've seen too many friends die Eric . I don 't want a war . I only want the man who murdered them . This is a war . What happened to you ? Did you lose your way when I was gone ? Are you still charles 's ' raven ? Or are you mystique ? Trask is the enemy . Killing one man isn 't enough . It never was for you . Good bye Erik . What happened ? Can he walk ? He need his treatment . Hank I can hear them . It 's ok I 'll make it stop . I 'll get it hey hey . Pull yourself together it 's not over yet . You don 't believe that ? How do you know ? As these go this coming back . They all come back . Look you know . I 'm still here . She 's still out there . But we need your help Charles . Not like this I need you . We can 't find raven .. .. Not without your powers . I added a little extra cause you missed a dose . Charles . Hank do me a favour . Would you help me to my study please . Gonna get you . Are you sure about this ? Absolutely not . This creature is extraordinary . Her genes could hold the key to mutation itself . I need more . That 's all they were able to scrape off the pavement in Paris . More than blood . I need brain tissue . Spinal fluid . Bone marrow . Imagine sentinels that could transform adapt to any target . If I just get my hands on her . This girl could lead the program forward years decades into the future . How old is your son now major ? Jason ? He 's coming up on 10 now if you can believe it . Eight years from fighting age . And how many of our sons and brothers did we just ship home in body bags ? Maybe 50 ? 55000 ? How many more in the other side ? Never before in all of human history has there been a cause which could unite us as a species ? Until now . You really hate mutants doctor don 't you ? On the contrary I rather admire them the things they can do . I assume mutants as our salvation . And common enemy . Common struggle against the ultimate enemy . Extinction . I believe our new friends are going to help us Usher in a new era bill . A new era of genuine and long lasting peace . Attention ! Attention ! Transport departure in two hours . Repeat . Transport departure begins in two hours . When was the last time you down here ? - Last time we went looking for students . - A life time ago . Welcome professor . Raven is wounded she won 't be moving fast . These are muscles I haven 't stretched in a long time . Gosh ! - No ! - Who are you ? Charles ! Charles it 's alright . I 'll go check the generator . It 's not the machinery is it ? - I can 't do this my mind ... - Yes you can . - It won 't take it . - It 's just a little rusty . You do not understand it 's not a question of being rusty . I can flip the switches I can turn the knobs . But my power comes from here comes from .. And it 's broken . I feel like one of my students . Helpless . It was a mistake coming down here . It was a mistake freeing Eric . This whole thing has been one bloody mistake . I 'm sorry Logan they sent back the wrong man . You 're right . I 'm . Actually it was supposed to be you . But I was the only one who could physically make the trip . And ahh don 't know how long we 've got here . But I do know that a long time actually a long time from now . I was your lost helpless student . And you unlocked my mind . You showed me what I was you showed me what I could be . I don 't know how to do that for you you 're right I don 't . But I know someone who might . Look into my mind . You saw what I did to cerebro . You don 't want me inside your head . There 's no damage you can do . That has already been done trust me . Hey . - Hey Logan . - Hey Jean . - Kill me . - I love you . You 're a .. .. Poor man . Look past me . I don 't want suffering ! I don 't want your future ! Pass my future . Look for your future . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it . Charles . Charles . So this is what become of us ? Erik was right . Humanity does this to us . Not if we show them a better path . You still believe ? Just because someone stumbles loses their way it doesn 't mean they 're lost forever . Sometimes we all need a little help . I 'm not the man I was . I opened my mind it almost overwhelms me . You 're afraid . And cerebro knows it . All those voices .. So ... .. much ... ... pain . It 's not their pain you 're afraid of . It 's yours Charles . And as frightening as it may be that pain will make you stronger . If you allow yourself to feel it embrace it . It will make you more powerful than you ever imagined . It 's the greatest gift we have to bear their pain without breaking . And it 's born from the most human power hope . Please Charles we need to hope again . Find what you were looking for ? Power is back on . Yes . Yes it is . She 's lost too much blood . - She can 't keep going like this - we have no choice Bobby . We can wake him up . No . They need more time . I had a glimpse into the past if we wake Logan now we may set off an even darker course . They need more time . Raven stop . Stop running . Charles . Where are you ? Back at the house . .. Where you should be . I need you to come home . I know what I need to do . If you kill trask you will be creating countless more just like him . Then I 'll kill them too . Those are Erick 's works not yours . The girl I grew up with wasn 't capable of killing she was good fair full of compassion . I have compassion just not for trask . He 's murdered too many of us . Shut her down Charles get in her head . She 's not letting me in I 'm barely holding on . I 'm not strong enough yet . I know what trask has done . But killing him will not bring them back . It will set you on a path from which there is no return an endless cycle of killing us and them till there is nothing left . But we can stop it right now . You and I. You just have to come home . I have to . You haven 't changed at all Charles . Like I said . I know exactly what I have to do . Where is he ? At an airport boarding a plane . Plane to where ? Washington DC . Hey guys there is something I need to show to you . We 're going backwards in time . This the system I designed to record any news about Paris over all 3 networks and pbs . All three ? Wow yeah and pbs . Look what I found . Tomorrow in front of the white house the president will make his announcement . He 'll be joined by secretary of defense Blair . And has even sought the help of renowned scientist bolivar trask . His special adviser to combat this mutant issue . White house is ... . Raven doesn 't realize but if she kills trask at an event like that with the whole world watching then I came a long way for nothing . And there 's more bad news I saw in a report . They found traces of her blood in Paris . For all we know they already have her DNA . That 's all they need to create the sentinels in the future . Now there 's a theory in time physics that time is immutable . It 's like a river you can throw a pebble and it will create a ripple but the current always corrects itself . No matter what you do the river just keeps flowing in the same direction . What are you trying to say ? I was saying is .. What if the war is inevitable . What if she 's meant to kill trask . What if this is just simply who she is . Just because someone stumbles loses their way . Doesn 't mean they 're lost forever . I don 't believe that theory Hank . And I can not believe that who she is . Ready the plane we 're going to Washington . Washington . D.C. You alright ? Getting there . Whatever happens today I need you to promise me something . You looked into my mind and you 've seen a lot of bad but you 've seen the good too . The X-Men . Promise me you 'll find us . Use your power bring us together . Guide us . Lead us . Storm Scott Jean . Remember those names . There 's so many of us . We will need you professor . I will do my best . Your best is enough . Trust me . 12 carriers inbound 10 miles . They found us . Thousands of people will be gathered here they come from all over the world witness history along with news crews from at least 50 different countries . Thank you . Can I see your invitations please ? Yes you may .. These two are with me . - Go ahead . - Thank you . Logan . Please this way sir . It 's fine ... I haven 't found her yet but she has to be here . President of the United States . My fellow Americans today we face the greatest threat in our history . Mutants . I 'm pregnant .. We have prepared for this threat . In the immortal words of Robert Oppenheimer . Behold .. The world will never be the same again . Can I help you ? No you can 't . Here they come . This for you brothers and sisters . Raven . I have her . Let me go Charles . There . You see ? Secret service man left to the stage . - Got it . - Go . What the hell are you doing ? I didn 't tell you to activate it . I didn 't . Raven please listen to me . We 've been given a second chance to define who we are . Don 't do this . Gentlemen you cannot pass this point . We can 't stop that many . No . But we can slow them down . Erik ! Move it ! Comon let 's go ! Storm ! Take us to def-con 3 . Mr. president we are code red . Air defense ready now . What the hell happened out there ? I 'll fix it . You said that before I wanted to make a statement . Now the whole goddamn world knows we can 't protect them . I will fix it . You damn well better . Charles ! Is everybody okay ? Storm ! Behind you . Now . I 'm probably not supposed to ask this kind of a thing . But in the future do I make it ? No . But we can change that right ? Do what you were made for . Mutants . Where are you ? I got this . Go . Oh dear god no . So much for being a survivor . One of them is in here . No ! No ! No ! Don 't kill it . I need it alive . What the hell has happened ? You built these weapons to destroy us . Why ? Because you 're afraid of our gifts . Because we are different . Humanity has always feared that which is different . But I 'm here to tell you tell the world . You 're right to fear us . We are the future . We are the ones who will inherit this earth . And anyone who stands in our way will suffer the same fate as these men you see before you . Today was meant to be a display of your power . Instead I give you a glimpse of the devastation my race can unleash upon yours . Let this be a warning to the world . And to my mutant brothers and sisters out there I say this : No more hiding . No more suffering . You 've lived in a shadows in shame and fear too long . Come out . Join me fight together in the brotherhood of our kind . New tomorrow . .. That starts today . All those years wasted fighting each other Charles to have a precious few of them back . Mr. president . Stand down ! I said stand down ! You want to make a statement ? Kill me ... Finally but spare everyone else ! Very heroic Mr. president . But you had no intention of sparing any of us . The future of our species begins now . Mutant mutants you used to be a better shot . Trust me I still I 'm . Get out of my head Charles ! Raven please do not make us the enemy today . Look around you we already are . They not all of us . All you 've done so far is save the lives of these men . You can show them a better path . Shut her down Charles I 've been trying to control you ever since the day we met . And look what that 's got us everything that happens now is in your hand . I have a faith in you raven . He 's all yours Charles . If you let them have me I 'm as good as dead . You know that . I know . Good-bye old friend . Good-bye Erik . You sure you should let them go ? Yes . I have hope for them . It 's going to be a time Hank . When we 're all together . What about Logan ? Good morning Logan . Late start . Hah hah ha . Have a good lunch time . Good job . - Thank you . - Very good job . Storm . Jean . Hi Logan . Are you okay ? You 're here . Where else would I be ? Woh . Easy pal . Some things never change . Good to see you Scott . Ah ha . See you later Jean . Professor . Logan . Is everything alright ? Yeah . Yeah I think it is . You did it . Did what ? Logan don 't you have a class to teach ? A class ? To teach . What ? History . History ? History I could use some help with that . Help with what ? Pretty much everything after 1973 . I think history I know is little different . Welcome back . It 's good to see you Charles . It 's good to see everyone . Well I had a promise to keep . You and I have lot of catching up to do . Yes . What is the last thing you remember ? Drowning . The past a new and uncertain world . A world of endless possibilities . And infinite outcomes . Can we ? Oh he is alive ! He is breathing countless choices define our fate . Each choice each moment a ripple in the river of time . What do you want us to do with him major striker ? Enough ripples and you change the tide . I 'll take him from here . For the future is never truly set .

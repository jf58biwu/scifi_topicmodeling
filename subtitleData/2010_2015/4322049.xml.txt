 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Mrs. Frederic has a connection to the Warehouse that even I don 't fully understand . This is Benedict Valda . He 's one of the Regents . Paris , 1899 . That 's where I 'd arranged for my daughter Christina to spend the summer with cousins . The men who came to rob my cousin 's home were expecting an empty house . I imagine losing a child is the worst pain a person can go through . Your breakfast is served , my lady . A banana ? That 's what you made me for breakfast ? Well , it 's actually half a banana because I could only find one in the kitchen , so we are going to split it . You know , if we were back at my place , I would have made you chilaquiles for breakfast . In bed . Oh , mi amore . You know how I love your chilaquiles . And your bed . Maybe ... Maybe it could be our bed . Well , you know Artie 's really strict about certain things . You know , he likes to have all his agents living under one roof , you know , just in case ... There 's an IRS emergency ? Exactly . You get it . Sure . I got to get back to work anyway . Okay . Oh , no , you didn 't . Hey , get back here . Hey ! So , what do you think ? About you moving in with Kelly ? Well , yeah . I mean , is it even kosher ? You know , Warehouse-wise ? Right . Forgot who I was asking . What is that supposed to mean ? She 's a tech nerd , she 's 150 , and you 're Myka , not exactly relationship success stories . Hey , I just got out of a serious relationship . You didn 't get out . He had to change his identity and move to a different state . By order of the Justice Department . Point taken . I know a thing or two about the opposite sex . Many of my lovers were men . We 're going to follow up on that at a later date . But for now , can we bring the focus back around to moi . Okay , Pete , you just have to ask yourself one question . I know , do I enjoy being yelled at in espanol ? Do you love her ? Yeah . I think so . I don 't know . Okay , you 're out to a restaurant , you order dessert . The waitress cuts it in half . One side is a little bit bigger than the other . Which half do you give her ? Well , the bigger half , of course , because otherwise ... Oh . Dude , you 're screwed . You love her . What ? - No . Shut ... MRS. - You 're in love . Oh , hi . Mrs. F. Yeah , well , apparently , based on a dessert , I guess . I don 't know . Me and the ladies were just ... Me and the ladies were just , you know , talking about a personal thing that I have . Not that you would ever ... You know ... If it 's cool , I 'd just like to keep my personal stuff , personal . Nothing personal , I mean , you know , to you , but can I go now ? One , Agent Lattimer . One what ? Singular sensation ? Is the loneliest number ? You are allowed to reveal the true nature of our work to one person . So the question is not whether you should live with Dr. Hernandez , but rather , is she your one ? Man , it 's good to be out of that desert and back amongst the living , huh ? You know what ? I might start a harem . How many girls are there in a harem ? Uh , three . Hold up , I finally got a signal . Dude , no phone calls . Chill out . I 'm just texting a pic back to my sister . Yeah , well , no one 's supposed to know that we 're here . She 's eight . Who 's she going to tell ? John , you know the deal . Don 't screw this up for us just before ... You okay , bro ? Yeah , I just suddenly got real thirsty . You look kind of weird , man . Terry ! Dude , what 's wrong ? Dry . Dry . Somebody help us ! Oh , my God , Rod ! We have to do something ! Mrs. F. Oh , my God , are you okay ? Hey , guys , I need help in here ! What ? Mrs. Frederic ? What happened ? One minute we were just talking and then ... Mooht pooh khesfet . Mooht pooh khesfet . - Mooht pooh khesfet . - Mooht pooh khesfet . I do not speak gibberish , Agent Lattimer . Okay . Well , not so much gibberish as ... Creepy , spooky , blah , blah . No , she 's right . It wasn 't gibberish . It was one phrase that you repeated over and over . " Mooht pooh khesfet . " It sounds Middle Eastern in origin . Maybe Aramaic or an old form of Hebrew . It 's demotic . The tongue of ancient Egypt . Dead languages are a hobby . So , what does it mean ? Well , I 'm not sure . It 's been a while . According to the translation program I get ... " The penalty is death . " What ? What did you set it on , extra scary ? To the best of my knowledge , I do not speak demotic , so what artifacts do we have from Egypt ? Already on it . Maybe it was dementia ... That caused me to say that . We 'll just keep going through the manifest until we find the artifact ... Holy synchronicity , Batman . We just got a ping from Egypt . What is it ? Nothing good . Thanks so much for talking to us about your son , Mrs. Tilson . We 're very sorry to have to ask you these questions . We know how difficult this must be . So , the body they found ... They 're sure then that it was my John ? I 'm afraid so , ma 'am . See , this doesn 't make any sense . John couldn 't have been in Egypt . John and his friends , they were working at an archeological dig in Peru . Peru ? Yes . He e-mailed me from there last week . That 's why this is insane . So , he didn 't say anything about going to Egypt ? No . Oh , God . I should call Terry and Rod 's parents . Maybe they ... What happened to our children ? Ma 'am , we promise you , we 'll find out . Hello . You 're John 's little sister , aren 't you ? That 's a very lovely photo , isn 't it ? They look very happy . May I ? Well , he 's very handsome , isn 't he ? And who 's that lovely little girl standing next to him ? Gabrielle . But everyone calls me Gabby . Hello , Gabby . Pleased to meet you . My name 's Helena . I 've got a little girl , you know , about your age . Does she talk like you do ? She does . May I have a look at your computer , please ? That 's your brother there , isn 't it ? Myka . John 's little sister had the picture , but she didn 't know where he was . Why he suddenly left an archeological dig in Peru to go to Egypt is still a mystery . He sent her this photo . It can 't be , can it ? Don 't make me ask . That would explain a great deal . Claudia , that image , print it out right now . Return with your team immediately . Okay , but what do I tell ... We have to confirm this . I 'm this close to asking . The ancient archives . Go . Yeah , bring the print . I hate myself for doing this . What are the ancient archives ? Photo . Artie , what does it mean ? The hieroglyphics in this photo match the markings right here , and it translates as , " An oasis between sand and sea . " What does that mean ? It means that someone has found the lost Warehouse . Someone 's found Warehouse 2 ? How do you lose a Warehouse ? It was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria . Back when the Romans were conquering Egypt in 30 BCE ... Thirty-one . They had ... They had very little time to shut down Warehouse 2 , transfer the artifacts , so the agents at the time buried it . Over time it was lost to the ages . I don 't buy that our three young Indiana Joneses just stumbled into it for a school project . Neither do I. It is rather unlikely . I think they must have broken the seal on the door , and that activated ... A defense mechanism . And that 's what caused them later to desiccate . Which is when Warehouse 2 woke up . Woke up ? You guys talk about it like it 's alive . Surely you know by now , Agent Lattimer , the Warehouse is more organic than your average structure . Warehouse 2 is back online ? So it would appear . It still don 't understand why it 's affecting you . When Warehouse 2 woke up , it began to look for its caretaker , but its caretaker had been dead for 2,000 years . So , it found the caretaker to the current Warehouse . And that 's you ? You 're the caretaker ? Yes . Each Warehouse has a unique bond with the caretaker , and now that bond is being shared between two Warehouses . That was never supposed to happen . Two networks , one server . My mind cannot take the level of data being , as Miss Donovan put it , downloaded . Eventually , it will overload . And by overload , you mean ... There is another difficulty . As Warehouse 2 continues to eclipse my bond , Warehouse 13 will begin to ... To die . So , we need to find Warehouse 2 and shut it down . I 'll call the Regents . They will send an expert to meet you in Egypt who will help you with Warehouse 2 . Don 't worry , Mrs. F. We got this . Agent Lattimer , this is unlike anything you 've ever faced . So , like always then . He said he 'd be wearing a Panama hat . That guy 's got Regent written all over him . That , or " mug me " a little , too . That would be a mistake . The man who tried to pick my pocket would soon wish he hadn 't . Mr. Valda , you 're the expert on Warehouse 2 ? I am , and if Agent Lattimer here can refrain from trying to kill me , we may even survive this . How did anyone ever find this desolate place ? Somehow those kids did . Looks like they planned on coming back here . They didn 't plan on dying . John 's sister , Gabby . Your Christina was about the same age . Yes , she was . Where on earth did they get this ? Maybe they thought they were going to get rich ? Instead , they got a deadly face full of hematite and natron . Basically , they were mummified alive . But that 's nothing compared to the challenges that await us within . In Warehouse 2 mythology , one phrase shows up over and over , " Mind , body , soul . " What is that ? A code ? When the security system was activated , several traps came into play to ward off intruders . Only fully trained agents at the time knew their secrets and how to navigate them safely . So , how does " mind , body , soul " help us ? That is for us to discover together . Once at the center we shut it down with this . One of the only things that survived the burial of Warehouse 2 . Then once more unto the breach , dear friends . I 'll be right there . I got to make a call . What ? I checked , this is what fashionable British archeologists are wearing nowadays . No , but it 's what American filmmakers think fashionable British archeologists are wearing nowadays . Oh , really ? Well , it is ever so comfy . Hi , this is Dr. Hernandez . Please leave me a message . Hey , Kelly , hey . It 's , um ... It 's me , Pete . I 'm sorry to call so late there , but I 'm about to go into ... A meeting , and it 's going to be a tough meeting . Lots of bad meeting stuff , you know ? So I ... Just in case . That I wanted to say that ... Well , I 've been thinking about you and I living together , and I think that ... Your time is up . Goodbye . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Oh , my God . This looks like some kind of torture device . It 's a neural assessor . It will monitor my brain waves and track the degree to which I 'll be affected . Yeah , her wave discharges have dropped considerably and that indicates an increase in the effect of focal epileptiform activity , and that means that ... We 've got until this moon thingy scooches over to that doodad . Yeah . When the moon eclipses , that will mean her brain has reached its ... Just keep an eye on the readout . Let me know if there are any changes . Artie , changes ! Changes ! Artie , we 're at the entrance . Valda 's deactivating the booby trap on the hatch . I 'm neutralized the hematite . The kids never made it past the entrance . That 's it . Warehouse 2 sensed an intruder . It 's having an effect on Mrs. Frederic . Valda says we 're good to go . We 're heading in . Yeah , okay , go in , but be careful and hurry . Mrs. Frederic doesn 't have much time . This totally blows the King Tut exhibit away . What are we looking at ? I 'm not sure . That 's not good . And you were right . Help me pry this open . Nope . It 's not going to be that easy . Okay , mind , body , soul . What if it 's three clues instead of one ? Three different traps , each one its own security device that needs to be deactivated . Right . And this is the first one . Mind . Yeah , as in I mind if this place flattens us like pancakes . Okay , well , what if we used one of these posts to brace the ceiling . No , no , no . Myka , Myka , Myka ! Wait ! Pancakes . Do you ever think about anything other than ... No , no , no ! This is like a game I used to play at the Pancake House . This is the only hole without a post , right ? A game of wits , a test of the mind ? No , a kid 's puzzle . Pete , how does it work ? Well , okay ... We have to jump each post , like checkers , but in a certain pattern until there 's only one post left . No , this is wrong ! I won free banana walnut pancakes every Sunday for a year . They had to discontinue the contest . Okay . He knows his pancakes . We got to take these out in order before the ceiling hits them . Okay . Okay . Okay . I 'm just chasing down this money trail ... Moot-kher-tou . Moot-kher-tou . Claudia , can you find out what that means ? Moot-kher-tou . Artie , she 's saying , " One must die . " Moot-kher-tou . Pete ! Okay . Okay , last one . Come on . Pete , all right ? It 's getting faster . Hurry . Pete ... Nicely done . Bravo . That 's right . Dig it . Who solved the test of the mind ? Pete did ! Only because you order off the children 's menu . Somebody 's buying me pancakes for a year . Perhaps we 're going to get through this mission after all . Wow . This couldn 't get any worse . Thanks for that . Okay , there has to be some way to shut this off . Maybe ... Maybe these hieroglyphs are some kind of instructions . Oh , let 's see ... Charlie Brown T-shirt , hairy eyeball , foot . It 's Tahtib . " The Art of the Way . " Isn 't that the ancient Egyptian martial art ? Like karate . This is the body puzzle . So , maybe this is the way . Okay , okay , that is definitely not the way ! That is impossible ! Artie ? Vanessa . Oh . I am so glad that you 're here . Well , glad is hardly the word under the circumstances . I know . I know . I know . It 's good to see you , too . I mean , it 's not good to see you . I know . We 're going to get through this . Oh , yes . Claudia , this is Dr. Calder . Dr. Calder ... Oh , Vanessa ? Oh , well , I 've heard a lot about you . A lot . Nice . Can we focus , please , on more important things ? Yes , of course . We 'll talk later . Will hell be freezing over ? Vanessa ? Oh , sure . There you go . Maybe we should try and rise above this situation . Think I know the way . I like her " the way " better . The grappler . Don 't leave home without it . Moot-kher-tou . " One must die . " Shall we ? Okay . The water bearer holds the key . What does that mean ? Just take this . Remember what I said . Wait a minute , what ? Aren 't you coming ? I 'm right behind you . Go ! Go on ! Hurry ! All right , all right . Use your feet . Valda ! Hold on ! I can make it back there . No ! You come back , we both die . Moot-kher-tou . One must die . This is as it must be . Now go ! We 're not just going to just leave you here ! I won 't give you the choice . No ! Why didn 't he let us help him ? I don 't know . He read something on the wall back there . It looked like it scared him . Can we even do this without him ? We have to . Look , we should tell Artie . Let me call him . It 's not working . Well , maybe we 're too far underground . It would seem we go this way next . We have to keep going , Pete . Yeah . Okay . Oh . Dr. Calder . Good . You know why I 'm here ? I do . Artie ? Your neuro functions are dropping . Are you in pain ? Yes . Claudia , something is happening to the team in Egypt . Use my Farnsworth to try to get a hold of them . Yeah , yeah . Her connection with Warehouse 2 is getting stronger . I can 't get a hold of them . I think maybe their Farnsworths are out of range . I 've got to check on something . I 'll be back . Wennen yefedu eem , ioo khemetoo eem . What is that ? What 's she saying ? " Where once there were four , " now there are three . " Loo hem senooi er tenem . Come on . Come on . " And two will lose their way . " Mummy ? Pete . Kelly ? Myka . Mummy ? Christina ? Myka ? Myka ? What 's happening ? Welcome back . A large Americano with an extra shot and room . My favorite . Christina ? Is that really you ? It 's you . It 's me . Right here . No , I mean it 's you . You 're the one . You . Here 's your next case . It 's a tough one . Lots of details , exactly the kind of thing at which you excel . I can 't wait for you to tell me all about it . I 've got you . I 've got you , love . And I 'll never let you go . I 'm a secret service agent working at a top-secret facility hunting down mysterious artifacts all around the world , and you are the only one that I 've ever told . It 's okay . I 'll always be right here for you , and I can keep your secret because I love you . Now it seems like just a series of random accidents there in Great Falls , Virginia ... Artie , what 's that doing there ? What ? There 's nothing there . The exit sign , it 's new . Very observant . That 's my girl . Once you and Pete get to Great Falls ... - How do you do ? - How do you do ? Such a pretty little girl . Mummy . Artie , why are you being so nice ? I 'm always nice . Ish . You don 't give compliments , and certainly not with a smile . I 'm getting more in touch with my feelings . What 's that exit sign doing there ? Well , come over here and I 'll show you . Come on . Myka , come right over here . Come on . Come here . Come on . Come over here . No , this isn 't real . This isn 't real . This isn 't real ! Pete ! H. G ! Pete ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Pete . Wait . H. G ! H.G. , wake up ! Mummy . Christina ! What did you do ? It 's a soul test , okay ? It tricked us . It took us to our happiest place and made us feel secure so we wouldn 't notice ... It 's the medusa . The medusa ! Thanks . It 's Kelly . What are you talking about ? She 's the one . Good . Yeah . We should keep moving . Helena ? Helena , are you all right ? My baby . My little baby . I 'm so sorry . It was so real . Mrs. Frederic is dying . If we don 't do this , Warehouse 13 could die with her . That 's real , and we have a chance to save her . Let 's get this done . Okay . We both know you must be prepared to do what you 've got to do . I know . It doesn 't mean I have to like it . What do you have to do ? What is that ? Claudia , we all want Pete and Myka to succeed in Egypt ... And they will . And if they don 't , and if Mrs. Frederic dies while she 's still the caretaker , this Warehouse will begin to close itself down . If the Warehouse is to survive , then a new caretaker must be in place before I die and a new connection must be made at that moment . A new connection ? With who ? Me ? Okay . Flattering , but ... Um , why ... Why me ? All of us have our purpose . I 'm really not ready for that . You will be when the time comes . It 's all part of the design . Won 't I just wind up getting my brain shredded , too ? Uh-uh . No . When the connection with Warehouse 2 is broken , Dr. Calder can take precautions . Pete and Myka could still shut down Warehouse 2 . Yes . But there 's not much time left . Loo hem senooi er tenem . The tests are over . We made it . This must be the ancient Artie 's office . That 's incredible . What is that ? It 's the only thing here that 's on . Yeah , not in a happy way . It 's probably safe to assume that 's what 's affecting Mrs. Frederic . Wait . Totally awesome . My God . Magnificent . Okay , so how do we turn this orb off ? Well , this is the control center . Let 's turn it upside down . I should probably go down to the Warehouse to see if there 's a way to switch it off down there . Myka , look at that . Okay , it 's a bunch of holes . Maybe what Valda gave me fits into one of them . Like a key . That 's what he said . A key . Come on , Mrs. F , hang on . We have to wait for Artie . He 'll know what ... Claudia , we can 't wait . It 's time . It 's just another puzzle , Pete . I 'm sure we can figure it out . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . There 's something about this that looks ... Maybe it 's like the mind test . We put the key in a series of holes in a specific sequence . No , no . It 's something about the pattern . It 's ... That 's it ! Myka , I know it . I need your wrist , please . Now , Claudia . That 's the night sky . I used to study it with my dad . Those are stars . Look , there 's the Big Dipper ! That 's Pisces and that 's Aquarius . The water bearer . And the water bearer holds the key . Come on , Pete , you 're almost there ! Just one more inch . You did it ! Wait ! Connection 's broken . They must have shut down Warehouse 2 . Yay ! Victory lap . See ? I knew they 'd come through . How do you feel ? Well , I won 't be running a marathon anytime soon . Yeah , no , certainly not in those heels . Myka . Myka . Thank you , Dad . That 's two I got , you know . I know . You solved one and I solved two . I know . It 's not a contest . You 're right . You 're right . It 's not a contest . But if it were , I 'd be winning . Myka , you have to see this ! Dr. Calder . Yeah ? I 'm really sorry . I didn 't mean to come off like a brat back there . I know you were just trying to protect the Warehouse . Oh , honey , it 's all right . Listen , you 're very young . You 're entering a world that 's vastly more mysterious than any of us can understand . I just want you to know , though , that you will be ready . Remember that . Tell Artie I said goodbye . Okay . Maybe you should be lying down . Maybe you should brief me on what was happening while I was ill . Ah , you found my little project . I did . Tell me . Okay . Well , something 's been eating at me since we got the ping . You know , those guys who were mummy-tized , they 're college kids . They 're not rich , but they went to Egypt , they staged this huge dig . It had to cost a chunk of change . You think someone hired them to find and enter Warehouse 2 ? Someone with long arms and deep pockets . You know , I find the source , I find the bad guy . Enterprising . I 'm impressed , Miss Donovan . And your research came up with something . I got a ping ? Yes , you got a ping . That can 't be right . The money that was used to hire those students , it 's from ... It 's from Warehouse 13 . Where 's Arthur ? I don 't know . He said he 'd be right back , but that was hours ago . H.G. , guess who just saved the day ? Oh , it was actually ... It was pretty amazing , with the night sky and the ... There were all these holes , and they were actually ... Stars . And ... Helena ? I do hope you can forgive me . For what ? This .

They keep sending stuff into space , but when it gets outdated No one wants to spend the money to take it down . ( reporter ) apparently the satellite is of russian origin . Scientists expected that it would disintegrate As it hit the earth 's atmosphere , and any unburned ... Just when I thought I 'd seen every possible way To screw up the Monday commute . They said they had the thing tracked As it entered the atmosphere . Came off of a satellite launched in the 80s . Nice of them to tell us about it . I 'm going down there .

I had a few problems down at the ranch , In case you didn 't notice . It 's new york city . There 's always a crisis . No , it 's bigger than that , rach . Bigger than your daughter 's birthday ? I went and saw jimmy 's body down at the morgue . He wasn 't just killed from electricity . What ? Something bit his leg , And left these eggs inside of his body . Can you check them out for me , give me an analysis ? Of course . Whatever bit him is stillm down there . Jesus , jason . Yeah , I know . I gotta go back . I gotta close the station . Em ?

Us military officials have erected a quarantine zone . Here 's what you need to know . The areas affected are broadway , Bowery , east houston and eighth street , all shut down . All traffic is being rerouted . ( man from helicopter ) you are in a military evacuation zone . Please leave the area immediately . This is bullshit . Adam put in an extra shot of espresso . You 're gonna need it . Sorry about caz . Yeah , thanks . I call this some primo shit storm . You got that right . What are we looking at ? We completely reset the routing , Keep the trains running as far away from this mess as possible , Which is no small feat . Good , good . We got an army of scientists and government security people Doing some high tech stuff at noble street station . By the way , they jammed the phone service In the area , no cell phones . I know , I 've been trying to call emily . Yo . Nah , no thanks . No , there 's no virus . You sure ? This is about those spiders that killed caz . I just got off the phone with rachel . The eggs don 't have bacteria on them . We got a bunch of suits telling the media outlets There 's some sort of lethal virus outbreak . Yeah , well , they 'll do anything to hide it . It 's not my pay grade to think about these things . That 's for people like you . It 's a real shit storm . Yeah , and now they 've locked down noble street station . Yeah , I guess you made the right call on those espressos . I 've got a shift about to go into triple overtime . I 'll see you back at the office . Thanks , pete . ( mp 1 ) hey man , you can 't be here . Hold it . I 'm station supervisor jason cole . Came to get my daughter . Jason cole . [ beeping ] You 're clear to go . [ metallic sounds ] [ hissing ] [ spitting ] [ spider squealing ] That 's all . Darnoff , tell your people to get their masks back on . We need to keep this virus story locked down . They don 't believe in your fairy tales here , colonel . Tell your people we have been vaccinated . You found what you 're looking for ? This is the first person to be bitten ? So I 'm told . Then someone must have taken it out . Taken what ? The queen egg . The queen is always implanted in the first host . These are male eggs . The queen will be a different shape and color . What color ? Pfft . Brown , maybe . Not this . This is jenkins . Yeah , I need all the paperwork with the body That we just picked up from the morgue . You tell me as soon as you 've got it . Twenty years , two marriages I 've served this project , Just to watch it crumble when the wall came down . And then it falls from the sky right into my lap . And you lose it . If we had the queen egg , None of this would be necessary . We wouldn 't have to work here in these tunnels , In less than ideal conditions . What 's wrong with the male eggs ? Why do we need a queen egg ? Why do we need the queen egg ? The queen is the only one That can produce the quality of webbing That your people require . Can you believe these creatures ? These are newborns , but already they work together . They have established their territory And now they build a nest for the queen . But if we don 't get the egg into their nest in twelve hours , She will die . So you and your people must find it , Or our work here is useless . This is jenkins . Give me operations . [ sirens wailing ] Health department supervisor rachel coles Has just logged a report on the eggs found In the subway worker 's body . Pull up her profile . It 's a match . Rachel cole , recently divorced from jason cole , Our nyt line supervisor that was at the hospital last night . Good work , gentlemen . We 're back on the trail . Let 's get this to jenkins asap . There 's nothing here . If there was , you would have found it by now . ( guard 1 ) get back here ! But I don 't feel sick ! ( phoebe ) hey ! ( phoebe ) hey , hey ! I want my dad . Stop it ! ( guard 1 ) you 'll stay for a few days . Watch her . Emily ! ( guard 2 ) sir , stay away from the building . My daughter 's in there ! Sir . We need you to step away .

White male , mid thirties . Dad ! Daddy , come on ! Sweetheart ! Daddy , come here ! Everything is gonna be okay . Just hold on . Daddy 's coming to get you . Daddy , come on ! Hurry ! I 'm coming !

Stay where you are [ gun cocking ] And put your hands above your head . Alright . Alright . Up here , take him out . [ elevator dings ] Hey , I don 't know what the hell we 've got here , But our lab people confirmed it 's not ... Well , they don 't know what the hell it is either . See , I 'm telling you , No bacteria in any of the eggs . Everything on earth has bacteria on it . Hey , come on . Before you start jumping to conclusions About little green men and area fifty-one , Get this to our lab uptown , pronto . Have them do a dna breakdown . They 've quarantined the whole neighborhood . You have to tell them that no bacteria Means there 's no virus . They have to know . Yeah , I 'm on that , okay ? I get this quarantine business is bullshit . But I 've got the mayor 's office working with me on this , But they 're gonna need a report on that . So if you can get this to the lab , pronto , I 'd appreciate that . Can you do that ? Don 't I always ? Thank you . Hey , sara ? Get me doctor smirnoff Or whatever his name is . For dr . Darnoff . Yeah , I 'll take that . Yeah , this is colonel jenkins . How can I help you ? Uh-huh . Well , thank you mr . Poor . Yeah . We 'll be in touch . Nicky ? We need to clean the trail . All of it ? Uh-huh . Nicky ... [ squeaking ] ( male reporter ) channel seven 's janet singer is live On the corner of second and noble . Go ahead , janet . ( janet ) city officials said today That the virus has been contained . However there is still no word On how long the area will be quarantined . And this announcement prompted an outcry from local residents Who are saying they are being deprived Of their homes and places of business And they are demanding compensation from the city and federal government . ( rachel on phone ) hey pete , it 's rachel . ( pete ) what 's up ? I 'm trying to reach jason and emily . He 's alright . They 're not picking up . He 's got a lot on his plate , you know , but he 'll always sort it . [ smack ] Hey , I 'm walking here , man . Pete , are you there ? Pete ? [ loud hip hop music from van ] Pete ! Hello ?

[ gasping ] [ shrieking ] [ shouting ] [ screaming ] [ cell phone ringing ] [ crying ] j ... jason . Thank god . ( jason ) what 's wrong ? Are you alright ? No . Yes . I am . But ... rachel , just ... Calm down and breathe . No ... There 's a man , he 's dead . What ? Two men tried to car jack me . There was nothing I could do . They took my purse with the eggs . The men . What 'd they look like ? What 's the difference what they looked like ? Rachel ? What did they look like ? Where are you right now ? I 'm , I 'm stuck in traffic . Get out . ( rachel ) I can 't leave the car . Just do what I say . Get out , run away , leave the car . I ... I can 't . Yes , you can . Do it , rachel . You have to . [ cars honking ] ( taxi driver ) hey , lady ! Good work . Alright , back to base . Is that it ? This is the queen . I will get it to the nest immediately . Good . The police are gonna want to question me . I ... Will you trust me , please ? Yeah . Where are you ? Where are you ? Couple blocks north of the office . Meet me at the bank . Okay . I 'm coming to you . I 'm a couple block ... Blocks east . Just act casual , Don 't draw any attention to yourself . What 's going on ? I 'll explain when I get there . Come on , pete . [ cell phone ringing ] [ panting ] ( jason on phone ) hello ? Pete , are you there ? [ grunting ] Can you hear me ? Pete ! Pete , what 's going on ? Talk to me , man . Pete ? [ spiders snarling ] ( jenkins ) jesus christ , what the hell happened ? [ snarling ] ( darnoff ) six inches per hour . Six inches per hour . [ angry snarling ] It 's growing so much faster here on earth Than it ever did in our space station . How big is the queen gonna get ? The genetic restrictions , Seven , maybe eight feet . [ snarling ] I 'll have to thank you , for finding my egg . It is undamaged , And it has been accepted in the nest . Yes , no problem . So that 's what this is about ? Huge spiders ? Look like huge spiders , But that is just the form that they are inhabiting . Twenty years ago , we discovered a spacecraft Deep under the ice in the caucasus mountains . Must have been there for a thousand years . What we found on that craft ... Defies all explanation . We took its dna , And we artificially fertilized in the zero gravity of space . We tried the gene splicing with many different creatures . But it was the spider ... That had the structure to enable it to survive In earth gravity and atmosphere . So , what about the webbing ? Come . A queen spider will weave an infinite supply Of lightweight , bulletproof , stealth material . Whatever nation controls this material Will have military and industrial advantage Light years beyond any other nation . Jenkins . Yeah . I don 't care how you lost him . You know , go to the apartment . You could pick him up there . You let me know when it 's done . You 're still holding these people ? You can let them go . Yeah , the security of this operation Is my concern , doctor , not yours . But we have the queen egg . We have no reason . I suggest you keep your eyes on your precious spiders And your god damned nose out of my business . Do I make myself clear ? And I suggest , colonel , That you do the right thing , And you let them go . [ chuckles ] [ sirens wailing ] [ chatter ] [ elevator dings ] [ ding ] Excuse me . ( man in suit ) mm-hm . ( woman ) hey , did you do the analysis On those weird eggs this morning ? Yeah . I washed my hands . [ silenced gunshot ] [ woman gasps ] ( bill ) yeah , but which department ? That 's not even my jurisdiction . No , you 're gonna have ... hold on a sec . Can I help you ? [ silenced gun shot ] ( emily ) let us out ! This is not fair . ( soldier ) keep it down or I 'll arrest you . We 're already arrested . I want a lawyer ! Yeah , sure . I 'll get you one right away . [ jiggles doorknob ] [ phoebe dialing ] Check the internet . [ beeping ] Not working . Yeah , there 's no cell service , either . Oh , we 'll figure it out . Rach . Jason ! I 've been calling home And I can 't get through . They quarantined emily and the apartment . They won 't let me get to her . [ sigh ] Rach ? Rach . We have to go find her . We 're going to . Emma . We 're gonna get her back .

They should be right here . Son of a bitch . ( rachel ) wait ! I know these tunnels , the quickest way to the apartment . Hey . This rail is live . Okay , okay . Okay . Shit . [ screams ] It 's just bats . This must be new york city , or a national geographic special . Welcome to the subway . That way . It 'll get us closer to the apartment . ( phoebe ) here . You should eat . What are you doing ? I 've got an idea . Emily , where are you going ? Come on ! I used to play in here when I was younger , but that was a long time ago . You mean like when you were an infant ? Oh . Okay . Talk about area 51 in manhattan . They won 't be complaining about the rats any more . [ shouts ] ( rachel ) oh , oh , my god ! Oh , my god ! [ roars and squeals ] Come on . Come on . Okay , okay . Oh . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Come on . No . It 's dangerous . No , emily ! Emily ! Come back ! There 's no stairs ! They 're out on the fire escape . What 's going on in there ? Come back ! Someone 's coming . Come on ! [ indistinct chatter ] [ clanking ] Holy crap . Let 's move out . ( jenkins ) how 'd it happen ? How many ? Uh-huh . All right . Go to code red . As many service men as you need . Just for containment , but hold your fire . So , they 're getting out of the nest . Some are above ground . How 'd this happen ? What 's going on ? The spiders are smarter than your engineers . Now the queen has been born , They want to explore the limits of their territory . But they won 't go too far from the queen . So , you tell your soldiers on the street Just to stay out of their way . All right . I 'm coming up . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ hazard sirens ] Oh , shit . [ hissing ] What was that ? Come on , let 's keep moving this way . [ spider noises ] [ hissing ] [ screaming ] no ! No ! No ! Oh , no !

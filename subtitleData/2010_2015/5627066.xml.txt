 Stephen : My name is Stephen Jameson . I 'm one of The Tomorrow People , The next step in human evolution . They call our powers the three t 's . Telepathy ... Cara : Stephen ? Stephen : Telekinesis ... And teleportation . There 's a shadow war going on between us and Ultra ... - No ! - The secret organization that hunts us . The only way to keep my species from going extinct Is to find my father . And the only way to do that Is by working for the enemy . Previously on The Tomorrow People ... Marla : You have a visitor . This is your uncle . Jedikiah : That 's your dad and I. Only I was born human , and he was born like you . Why didn 't you tell me Jedikiah was my uncle ? You are not like him . You 're one of us . He asked me to come work for him . Stephen , you have no idea what you 're getting yourself into . I 'm in . Welcome aboard , Stephen . Stop ! Stop ! You don 't understand . Just listen to me . Listen to me , okay ? You and me , we 're the same . [ panting ] oh , yeah ? Yes . [ straining ] Prove it ! [ yelling ] [ cars honking ] [ alarm clock blaring ] Up , up , up . Stephen . [ alarm stops ] I 'm leaving . I 'm working a double at the hospital tonight , So you have to make sure that you pick up your brother And he does his homework , all right ? Here . I got your meds refilled . [ inhales ] You 're gonna have to get creative again with dinner . Oh , Stephen , this room . Clean it up ! [ door closes ] Stephen : About those powers , Sometimes they work perfectly . [ rumbling ] Mom says I 'm supposed to babysit . What am I , nine ? Pass . Yeah , agreed . Stay out of trouble . Dude . Bus stop 's this way . I 'll find my own way to school . Stephen : And sometimes my powers ... [ clattering ] Are a little off . [ shoe squelching ] Where 'd you come from ? I was waiting for you outside . Hey , uh ... I teleported . Kidding . Kidding , kidding . Uh , my ... My mom gave me a lift . Great . I see we 've moved into the comedy portion of your psychotic break . I 'm sorry . I was off my meds . Now I 'm back on them . I 'm good . Okay ? Seriously . So , does that mean you 're free to hang ? Can we watch dumb internet videos and plot a revolution or something ? Yes . 8 : 00 my place ? I 'll be there with bells on . Okay . Okay , I 'm going this way . Stephen : This is my after-school job . Ultra . To the outside world , it 's an institute of genomics and advanced bio-mathematics . But what they 're really researching is us . The next phase in human evolution . They call our powers the three t 's . Teleportation . Telekinesis . And finally , telepathy . Reading someone 's thoughts is just the beginning . [ thinking ] with the proper training , You 'll be able to access their feelings , their emotions . Even their memories . Stephen : But what about the things I don 't want them to see ? Jedikiah would drive us extinct . Just for the sake of the human race . We 're not done here . Um , I have to babysit my little brother . I forgot . I gotta go . Ah , just who I was looking for . Walk with me . Actually , I 'm in a bit of a hurry ... It 's okay , it can wait , it can wait . Right now , I 'd like to bring you up to speed on our program . Welcome to our nerve center . We 've got news feeds , surveillance monitors , Police wires , we track incidents , Altercations , suicidal teens , Behavioral disorders , reports of chronic sleepwalking , Which is how we found you , by the way . Anything that can indicate a new breakout And then we have our Agents , like you and Vaughn , Who help us track rogue paranormals . Homo superiors ? Yeah , I don 't especially like that name . [ chuckles ] you and me both . No , it implies my race , the human race , is somehow inferior . Which is why you want to round ours up , Strip them of their powers ? No , it 's up to us to guard against a species who can strike anywhere , Any time . [ gun shots ] [ people screaming ] What are you doing , Harold ? It 's not me , I 'm not doing this . Something 's moving me ! Hurry up ! Please ! I don 't want to hurt anyone ! Just stay down , please . I 'm sorry . Harold : Don 't look at me ! [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ horn sounding ] Stephen : [ thinking ] Cara , we need to talk . Cara , come on , answer me . Fine , you don 't want to come to me ? I 'm coming to you . I 'm gonna have to mark you down on the dismount . Yeah . Still working out a few kinks with the whole teleporting thing . What are you doing here ? Wow , what happened to the whole , " welcome , Stephen , you 're one of us , " we 're the lost boys " speech ? That was before you went to go work for Ultra and Jedikiah . He 's right . You have no idea what you 've gotten yourself into . Actually , I do . Okay ? That 's why I 'm here , to give you guys a heads-up . They were inside my head today . If I didn 't leave , they might have figured out I 've been talking to you . You 're not talking to us . You 're not seeing us . Not anymore . Look , it 's not like I want to work there . Okay ? I 'm doing it because I have to . Because I have a life , and a family . You 're not the only one who had a human life . Ask Cara about the little sister she left behind . We all made sacrifices , Stephen , but somehow , You think you 're special . You don 't think I know what it 's like to lose someone ? Up until last week , I thought my dad , your great hero , Was just some human loser who left me . Now I don 't know what to think other than he 's alive . But how are you gonna find him If you 're hiding down here like a bunch of paranormal refugees ? I will do whatever it takes to find my dad . If that means working for Ultra , fine . Jedikiah 's goal is to eliminate our species from the face of the planet . I worked there , Stephen . I know . Getting inside your head , it 's just the beginning . You haven 't even scratched the surface of what they can do . And as long as you 're down here , the rest of us aren 't safe ! [ door opening ] What are you doing ? Saying goodbye . Mom 's gonna kill you . You sold me out ? Hell no , bro . Where have you been ? I have been calling for hours . You didn 't pick up Luca from soccer , If Astrid hadn 't had called , I would 've gone to the police . Thought something happened to you . I 've been here since 8 : 00 . We were supposed to hang . [ sighs ] Right . I got tied up . I 'm sorry . And I forgot to call . How long you been off your meds ? What ? I found them in the trash can . You tossed my room ? Of course I did . I 'm gonna go . Mom , I know you 're not gonna believe me , But I threw out my meds 'cause I don 't need pills . I don 't need a shrink . I feel better than I have in a year . That 's exactly what your father would say . And I believed him , every time . But it wasn 't true . He wasn 't fine . And neither are you . Mom , I am fine . No , you 're not ! You 're not fine ! Okay , Stephen ? I can 't force you to do anything You don 't wanna do . But , baby ... Please . You , me and Luca ? That 's all we 've got . Yeah , yeah . You 're right . I shouldn 't have gone off my meds cold turkey . I will call Dr. Bloom tomorrow . Promise ? [ pulsating ] Marla : Please don 't do this . We 'll move again , we can find another doctor , And you 'll get better . That 's not what this is about . Well , then what is this about ? I don 't love you anymore . What 's wrong ? Nothing . Uh ... I just ... I 'm tired . I think I 'm gonna crash . Cara : Tim ... Harold : [ on video ] just stay down ! Is it me , or are you getting slower ? Tim : Facial recognition is a slow process , And as you know , I am scheduled for my software updates . Sorry I can 't take you back to where I stole you for maintenance . Ultra wouldn 't like that very much . I have it . A 99.99 % likelihood . Kurt Rundle . Went missing two weeks ago , Coinciding with Cara 's first sensing of him . Mother recently filed a missing persons report . He 's been in and out of Belleview ... Dude 's completely out of control . So , what 's the plan ? Until his breakout 's complete , I can 't pick up on his voice telepathically . Wait for him to rob another bank . Hope Ultra doesn 't find him first . Good plan . [ door slams ] Are you okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . No , you 're not . You 're tired , you 're stressed . You feel responsible for all of us , and not just the ones down here . Hey . Get out of my head . Dark place , don 't want to be there . Why don 't you take the night off ? I was thinking we could crash our favorite suite at the four seasons . Tim : You 're referring to room 2411 . It is currently occupied by Mr. John Kenneth Peterson from St. Louis . He 's run up quite the adult entertainment bill . Very romantic , Tim . Let me get cleaned up . Tim : Cara , you do realize you are searching through John 's personal property ? And according to new york penal code article 14010 ... Tim , don 't be that guy . You want to make yourself useful ? Help me find the D chip . You 're referring to John 's D chip ? End cabinet , second drawer , small wooden box . The chip is inside . I don 't imagine John will be pleased to part with this . Someone needs it more than we do . [ shower running ] [ pulsating ] Cara : Stephen ... Are you there ? [ chuckles ] Okay , we have to establish some ground rules . Like not invading each other 's minds while we 're naked . [ police sirens ] Nice place . So , what 's good ? We 're not here to eat . Give me your hand . [ sighs ] Stephen : You got me an old watch . Thank you ? Cara : It 's got a chip in it . It 's made of the same material used in the secure part of Ultra . It deflects telepathic signals . Stops anyone who tries to get inside your head . You keep that on . No one will be able to know what you 're thinking . It 'll protect you . And also protect you . Something happened to me tonight . I was talking to my mom , and I saw what ... What I guess was one of her memories Of the night my dad left . He was awful to her . Maybe I am making a mistake . People are complicated , Stephen . You spend half of your life in their heads , That much becomes pretty clear . John said you had a sister . We may be connected . We 're not there yet . [ pulsating ] John : Cara . I think we just found our boy , Kurt . Looks like he 's graduated from robbing banks And knocking over armored trucks . I have to go . Take care of yourself , Stephen . John : Looks like we 're late again . Kurt must have made him crash . That 's him . Kurt Rundle . We 're not going to hurt you . Not going to turn you into the cops . Cara : Just come with us , Kurt . We can explain everything . [ police sirens wailing ] Let 's go . I can 't understand how I couldn 't Control my arms and legs , it was ... It was like someone had my ... [ stammers ] My limbs on a string . Or something . It doesn 't make any sense . That 's the second guard to tell that story this month . Pretty soon the local PD is going to smell a rat . That hostage , the kid in the hoodie you managed to disappear , We 're running facial recognition on him now . Good . Kurt Rundle , address in north Bergen . Go . I 'm on it . Great , I 'll go with . An active bank robber is not the kind of breakout You want to cut your teeth on , kid . If trouble jumps off , I teleport out . The subject is violent and antisocial ... You promised I could see Ultra top to bottom . Hey , now , I have been busting my ass training , But how am I going to see this program 's big picture When I 'm stuck behind a desk ? I 'll keep him out of trouble . Fly on the wall . Yeah . [ grunting ] I lost track of you last night . Hope you didn 't hit our favorite hotel suite without me . I saw Stephen . [ grunting ] I also noticed my watch is missing . Any correlation ? It 's not like I gave away your letterman jacket . I don 't care about the watch . [ grunts ] Really ? You seem a tad upset . I 'm trying to protect us . And I am trying to protect Stephen . [ Cara groans ] Who 's working for Ultra . We need him . You know that . Stephen 's the " chosen one , " remember ? Just because the two of you are all mind-meldy , Doesn 't mean he couldn 't sell us out in a heartbeat . Jealous much ? You 're kidding . [ grunting ] Cara : He did stop time . I don 't care what he did , or who his father is . I will not let Stephen take the rest of us down with him . You understand ? Yeah . I think I got it . [ car alarm beeps ] Truant officers ? I thought you were the police . That you might have news on Kurt . I filed a missing person 's report two weeks ago . Well maybe we can help find Kurt through his friends at school . Are there any names you can give us ? Anything unusual ? Mrs. Rundle : I did notice that Kurt was keeping odd hours . Ma 'am do you have any idea ... Uh , where 's Kurt 's father ? He died . Kurt was five . Any idea ... Where Kurt might be keeping himself ? The movie theater , the mall , a girlfriend ? Stephen : How long has he been on medication ? About three months . He 's been hearing voices ? Is it possible that your son kept a diary ? My colleague could take a peek into his room , Look for it while we 're talking . Respectfully , of course . Sure . Thanks . Kurt : Go away , please . Just go away . Please . Just go away . Stephen : [ thinking ] he 's in the crawl space above his bedroom . Vaughn : Good job , kid . Well Mrs. Rundle , we sure do appreciate your time . You hear anything from Kurt ... Please just give us a call . [ weapon charging ] [ zapping ] What the hell are you doing ? [ tires screeching ] [ guns cocking ] Upstairs bedroom . Why are they here ? We can 't kill people . They can . Stephen ! Get your ass back here ! Stephen : No . Wait ! Wait ! [ shotgun blasts ] No . You sent in a kill squad to mow down a 17-year-old kid ? Okay , first of all , he 's not a kid , he 's not even human . No offense . He 's a paranormal menace . And that gives you license to put him down like an animal ? Look , I told you from the very beginning , we were in a shadow war With your kind and mine . You didn 't think there 'd be any casualties ? Okay , enough with the war lingo . This isn 't a war , it 's genocide . One thing you 'll understand after you 've been here longer than 15 minutes , Is that we police ourselves so the handful of people in the government That actually know about us , won 't do worse . Now , do we kill ? We do . But only those we can 't help , train , or bring into line . Our kind can 't even kill . Yet . But you are one mutation away from acquiring that ability . That 's insane . Oh , come on , Stephen , we 're protecting humanity . You 're in the big leagues now . Please don 't make me regret calling you up . And Stephen ... No one barges into my office . I 'll make an exception this one time because you 're new . And because you 're family . Something happened . There 's no one else I could talk to . Surprise . This new breakout has been robbing banks . He 's on the run from Ultra . Looks like they beat us to Kurt . They 're gonna kill him . Duh . I know that they 're bad guys , but execution ? Jedikiah just said they strip them of their powers . When a breakout demonstrates anti-social behavior , They take more extreme measures . Yeah , yeah . I just got a front row seat , we got to find him . Once a breakout 's on Ultra 's radar , it 's too late . It 's too dangerous for us to get involved . He 's gonna get a bullet in the head and you 're talking risk assessment ? We bring in as many as we can . And then what ? When are you going to stop hiding ? You think this is what my dad had in mind ? You don 't know what you 're talking about . Jedikiah has an army . And not only his TP slaves , the ones like you , He has human operatives intent on killing every last one of us . I have a responsibility to protect us . Kurt 's just a screwed up kid , okay ? He doesn 't deserve to die . Neither do we . You want to crawl back underground ... Fine ! I 'm saving this kid . Stephen , we are not superheroes . We are a hunted species , trying to survive . And we will survive . That 's what your dad had in mind . Let 's go . Homework . Totally swamped . Luca , if I hear you playing video games ... Yeah , I got it , ma . I 'll wear headphones . He learned that trick from you . Yeah , he did . Mom . Last night got me thinking about dad . All these years , it 's been like we 're not allowed to talk about him . But I 'm ready to know the truth . Why did he leave ? Why did ... Why did we change our name ? Okay . Your father ... Was out of control . I never knew where he was or what he was doing . But he was in trouble . I mean so much so that ... One night he packed us up and said , " we 're moving . " Do you remember that ? Said we were going to see the country , or something . No , we were on the run . We moved from city to city until we ended up here , and then ... Then I thought we were done running . But it turns out your dad was just done with me . [ sighs ] it didn 't matter . That 's why when you started acting like him , I didn 't ... - Mom ... You will never go through that again . Okay ? I promise . Would you hold still ? Tim : Forgive me , my exhaust system triggers automatically , Every six minutes . I built your exhaust system , pal , spare me the lecture . Stephen 's right . We should bring in Kurt . Here we go . Bank robber boy 's a reckless jackass , But so was I. And I turned out totally awesome . Look . I 'm not judging this kid , but we have rules . What about me ? You had no business bringing me in . You risked your life . That was a long time ago , I was dumb . Not that I regret it . Well I don 't want to regret sitting on our hands doing nothing this time . Kurt needs us . Look , we get that you 're looking out for us , but ... But Stephen called it . At some point we have got to stop playing defense , And fight back . I mean we 've hiding out down here for two years . Which is two years longer than any of us would have survived up top . We are all for survival . But if we 're not going to stand up for our own , what 's the point of surviving ? Any news on Kurt ? My guess is he 's laying low . [ computer beeping ] This kid can teleport anywhere he wants , And we find him hiding out in a crawl space ? Is that kind of thing normal ? Where did you go when you discovered you had powers ? Nowhere . Exactly . The crazier life gets , the more we want to hold on to what 's familiar . [ gasps ] It 's where I would have come . How the hell did you ... Empty building , good view of your house . I got a family too , okay ? I 'm not going to hurt you . You 're the dick who ratted me out . I had no idea they were going to send in a swat team , all right ? You 're lying or you 're an idiot . Look , there 's a group of us , okay ? Not the guys in the suits . A kind of paranormal underground . Okay ? Where people like us are safe . You got to trust me . We 've all been through the same thing . You 're just trying to get in my head . I don 't have to . Okay , I was you Kurt . Let me take a wild guess . You 're robbing banks , because your mom can 't afford to pay for your pills . And you feel responsible . How do you think I found you here ? But I 'm not the only one who can find you . So this paranormal underground ... They 're not going to try to kill me too ? No , the opposite , okay ? Just let me show you . Come with me . [ pulsating ] Vaughn : Thanks , kid . I 'll take it from here . Okay now , son ... Take it easy . Okay . I just want to talk to you . Ah ! Don 't hurt him . I 'm just going to put him asleep for a while . [ thudding ] [ grunting ] son of a ... [ breathing rapidly ] Stephen : Kurt ! Stop ! Kurt ! Kurt ! Stop ! [ grunts ] Kurt . [ sighing ] Kurt . Stop ! Stop , you don 't understand ! Just listen to me . Listen to me , okay ? You and me , we 're the same . Oh , yeah ? Yes . Prove it ! [ gasping ] Where 's Kurt ? Kurt ? Kurt , I know you 're up here . Kurt , I was like you . I was alone . Terrified . Every meal I ate was stolen or fished out of a dumpster . But then somebody helped me . The way I want to help you . Just ... Tell me you 're listening . No ... It 's gone too far . Kurt : I pushed that guy off the roof . He 's fine . Kurt : That 's not possible . Come out , Kurt . You 're not sick . You 're one of us . I thought I told you ... [ yelling ] to leave me alone ! I 'm just trying to help you ! When you wake up . Jedikiah : Okay , let me just see if I can get this straight here , uh ... You could 've captured the breakout , but instead , You bulldozed your supervising Agent and let the target go free . He 's green , I should 've ... - There will be ample time to explain yourself , Mr. Vaughn , Right now we 're focused on Stephen . Okay ? I 'm not helping you execute a kid . You know what ? Maybe I don 't belong here . I 'm not offering you a choice . With powers like yours , I 'm afraid we can 't let you just walk away . No . No . You know , what I 'd like to believe Is that this is just the isolated act of a naive mind . If , however , it was something else ... If it 's a , uh ... I don 't know ... A conspiracy to hand over a deviant breakout to The Tomorrow People ... Now , I have to say that that would be quite unforgivable . Anything you want to tell me , Stephen ? No . Good . Good . Well , then your debrief should be a piece of cake . Isn 't this the debrief ? Oh , no . That 's done by a senior telepath . She 's very thorough . That 's new . Uh , pretty old , actually ... May I ? It was your dad 's . Beautiful watch . One would never suspect . D chip . Deflects telepathy . Clever . Always the tinkerer , your dad . I am gonna keep this . I really don 't want anything compromising your first debriefing . [ all laughing ] What do you think those two are conspiring about ? - You don 't want to know . You did the right thing . Saving Stephen ? Bringing Kurt in . But , yes . Saving Stephen . You can trust him , John . I know . You trust him . And I trust you . What do you say we swing by the hotel ? Tim says our suite 's empty . I 'll teleport to that sushi bar of yours . Grab us some room service . [ pulsating ] Stephen : Cara , I 'm in trouble . It 's him . It 's Stephen . I may trust him . But I really hate his timing . What is it , Stephen ? Stephen : He took the watch , and some bionic telepath Is about to go postal inside my brain . Get out of there . Not an option . What do I do ? Cara : Stephen , if she gets in your head , she 'll know everything . You need to fill your mind with something else . An idea , an emotion , a memory . Something so overwhelming , so powerful , it eclipses everything else in your mind . Are you ready ? Ready . What 's your name ? Stephen : [ thinking ] Stephen Jameson . Is the sky blue ? Yeah , depending on the day . Woman : Did the tomorrow people assist today 's breakout in his escape ? Stephen : Not that I know of . Woman : Where 's the breakout right now ? Stephen : I don 't know . Woman : Did the tomorrow people assist today 's breakout in his escape ? Stephen : No . Woman : Did The Tomorrow People assist today 's breakout in his escape ? Stephen : I said no ! You really should keep this at home , you know . Wouldn 't want to scratch a family heirloom . Good idea . Congratulations . It appears you passed your debriefing with flying colors . Good work . Thank you . - No , thank you for being a straight shooter . I have to admit , I was a tad concerned we had a problem , but this seems to be Nothing more than a senior Agent who failed to keep his trainee in check . This wasn 't Vaughn 's fault . Oh , fault has nothing to do with it , Stephen . This is about accountability . If I cannot hold my Agents responsible for their subordinates , The efficacy of the entire program breaks down . I 'm accountable . Yes , there are people above me , Stephen . Who ? Another day . Look , I think the lesson today is clear . Failure will not be tolerated . So what happens to Vaughn ? He 's being put on a desk . Not your concern . Have a good night . [ ringing ] [ ringing echoing ] Hey , we gotta talk . If you wanna thank me for saving your life , now we 're even . No . I mean , yes , thank you . But that 's not ... You wanna give me my watch back ? It 's my dad 's watch and you can tell me how you got it later . I came here to tell you that you were right about Ultra . I can 't work there anymore . Hey , they killed my partner because of me . Now I thought I could find my dad without getting caught up in my uncle 's world . I was wrong . No , you weren 't . I was . You said we can 't keep running , that we have to stand and fight back . You 're right . But we need you on the inside to do it , Stephen . Can 't you see ? This is perfect , you working for Ultra . The only way we can take it down is from ... No , I 'm not going back , okay ? It 's way too dangerous . Jedikiah already had one of his evil telepaths Try and figure out where you guys were hiding . If he finds out , it 's my fault . I can 't do it . Okay ? I 'm ... I won 't put the people I care about in danger . I didn 't realize you had such strong feelings for us . Look , if Ultra could get inside your head , they 'd be here right now . Look , you had that watch . Your father gave me that when he left . Not just to protect me , he told me it was to remind me to be brave . I guess somehow I must 've forgotten that . Thanks for reminding me , Stephen . It 's yours now . Stephen : Thanks for coming . Are you sure we 're safe here ? Ultra can 't pick up on us . There 's a few safe spots like this in the city . Whoever built this place was one of us . They also happen to have amazing dumplings . I meant safe from your boyfriend . My what ? John ? It 's a ... It 's not like that . What 's it like then ? Oh , wait . Okay , let me guess . It 's a new species of relationship . In the future , People won 't have to use outdated terms like " boyfriend " and " girlfriend . " Did you really bring me here to talk about my personal life ? No . [ laughing ] [ sighing ] I just wanted to thank you . For talking me through a bad situation . How 'd you do it ? How 'd you keep ' em out of your head ? I did what you told me . I thought of something that could fill my whole mind . I focused on the most painful thing I could think of . I 'll show you . What are you doin ' up ? I heard you and mom fighting . Are you going somewhere ? Yes . But I 'll be back . I need you to do me a favor . I need you to look after your mom . Can you ... I don 't want you to go . I know , honey . I don 't either . Be brave for me , Stephen . Be brave . That 's why I have to find him . I can 't let that be my last memory of my dad . What are you gonna do ? I 'm gonna do what he asked me to do . Stephen : I 'm gonna take care of my family . I 'm going to be a better brother . A better son . And a better friend . To both of our species . Because what I 've realized is that I can 't turn my back on either of them . [ yelling ] you cheater ! [ indistinct talking ] But the only way I can do all this is by pretending to be a good soldier . By working for my uncle . Staying one step ahead of him . And that is what I 'm going to do . Keep an eye on him . His former partner was negligent . But his debrief was clean . Too clean . You think he 's still in touch with them ? Oh , I do . And when the time comes , Stephen will lead us to The Tomorrow People . And we 'll kill them .

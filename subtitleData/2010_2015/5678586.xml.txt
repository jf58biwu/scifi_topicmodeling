 Why did you come here ? This never would 've happened if you guys hadn 't come here ! This place isn 't your world ! It 's the world our hero left us ! The hero ... The hero ... Deia ! It didn 't hit any vital spots ! I think her brain 's been overtaxed . The neural load was too much for her . I 'll see if I can stabilize her . Deia ... Finally shut ' em up ... Hurry and cyber-lock ' em all . Got it . Something 's coming . Is it that red one ? ! there ! Stop ! The heroine fell in love with the king and had a child ... Briareos ... The heroine sought ... the treasure ... 109 . 113 . We 've taken an unexpected visitor into our protection . Deunan ! at Gaia 's request . Alcides ... Deunan ! Hurry here ! there ! Don 't cry ! Even Gaia had prepared a double of him ... This is truly unexpected . But the god of jealousy is also wiser than the god of the earth . Her neural load 's increasing ! Deia ! Bioroids must pay . Deia ! The other Landmate ! Vengeance belongeth unto me . It 's kind of sad that we have to say goodbye to him today . Have you gotten attached ? plus you only took care of it because Gaia asked . but still ... Deia ! I wonder if this is how humans ' " happiness " feels ... A red one 's headed your way ! It 's after the baby carrying Alcides ' genes ! We 'll take care of the other one ! Roger ! The last unprocessed bioroid is at the Argonaut ? Yes . Will it arrive here safely ? If we have faith in ES.W.A.T. So Gaia wants us to trust in humans ... Humans have a force of will bioroids can never possess . Unprocessed bioroids carrying hereditary components of Alcides ' genes ... they present new possibilities ... If Gaia has chosen to have humanity decide their future then we must have faith in humanity too . - Damn you ! ... then we must have faith in humanity too . Briareos ! You okay ? ! Yeah ... We 'll protect your world ! now ! Go where ? ! Just go ! Move ! all right . Deunan . I gleaned some info from Deia during our neural link . What 's her deal ? It happened just before the Argonaut was bombed . A bioroid of me ... Yep . It will be at your beck and call from now on . Deia . I 'm sure you 'll make a great partner . I have high hopes for you . Alcides . Don 't reduce the hydraulic pressure ! You 'll fry the generators ! - What 's next ? - Next is B8 . Got it . Alcides . You should have the bioroid handle things like that . after all . I fully understand that . But ... Bioroids aren 't human . Compasses always point in the same direction or a cyborg . using bioroids as a workforce might seem natural to you . But that 's precisely why I want you to understand . we must not lose the ability to feel . I consider them all treasured family members . but humanity is not the bioroids ' ruler . He has your eyes . Running a simulation of our upcoming baby ... You 're sure in a rush . A paradise where people can live like people ... any place where I can live with you and this child is paradise . Deia ... Poseidon used the bioroid Deia brought here as a marker to bombard the Argonaut . but Deia miraculously survived . Deia became Poseidon 's heroine . What made her become a Poseidon minion ? Perhaps hating bioroids was the only way she could cope with the sorrow she was left with . You simply don 't know . The sadness of losing someone is nothing like that . True sadness produces hate . Bioroids aren 't human . They kill people without qualms if ordered to . They 're coldhearted puppets . Don 't wait until it 's too late . I speak from experience . Briareos . Wanna get married ? you know ! I know . I want Deia to remember ... I want her to remember her family again . The family she loved . just like she did . Can my answer wait until after the mission ? Yeah . Let 's stop Deia ! Right ! She 's here ! Deia ! Stop ! Deia ! Deia ! Deunan ! even at the cost of my own life ... Deia ... I love you . my paradise vanished ... Briareos ... What is this place ? ! I never wanted to be a hero . I just wanted to travel with you in search of paradise ... Goodbye ... Deunan . Deia ! We are the gods who created the bioroids . those who defy the gods are punished to live with unending suffering . Bioroids exist to be used by us . Never forgive anyone who betrays the gods . I chose to sell him out to Poseidon so that I could live with the gods . Deia ... Deia . You forgot this . Compasses always point north . compasses always point in the same direction . Deia ... and me getting along you were reminded of the time in your life when you were happy . Deia was adored by the Argonauts like a family member . the manned outer space exploration vehicle is about to be launched . The Ark Project was delayed . I 'd say we had a good measure of success . Indeed . There 's no need for worry . I 've erased all data relating to the incident . No one will suspect Poseidon of anything . Everyone believes it was done of her own accord . about the independent institution where I 'm to be made director ... Would it be possible to push the inaugural ceremony back one week ? nothing . I was just planning on enjoying a short vacation . Deia ... Maybe what humanity is striving for isn 't the kind of paradise we have in mind . Even so ... Do you think we 'll ever find it ? Our paradise ... too . A paradise where humans and bioroids can all be family ... Yes . Briareos . That reminds me ... what 's your answer ? Huh ? Answer to what ? You forgot ? ! You 're terrible ! - No idea what you mean . - Just give me your answer already ! back to work ! Let 's go ! Hey !

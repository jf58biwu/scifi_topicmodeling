There 's someone they want got rid of . They want you to do it . I want to help you , and I believe this is right , it 's just , uh , I don 't think I can . Do you think I wanted to be Mr. Rabbit ? I 've come to find you . Why ? ( GUNSHOT ) We need to run . All of us . Right now . ( FOOTSTEPS ) I made breakfast . It 's brown rice with pulses and nuts . It 's healthy . Well , I 'm not eating your food . It 's good you think like that . No , mate . I 'm not eating that , cos it 's fucking pigeon food . So , you said they wanted him ? So we can all just go , then ? What ? ! Becky ! They 'll have found your DNA at the factory . So what do we do , then ? He knows something . If we want to live , we need to find out what he knows . And why are you helping us ? I 'm turning over a new leaf . Imi pare atat de rau . Ce ti-am facut tie ... mamei tale ... Just fuck off , you dirty old nodger ! He likes you . It 's good . Yeah ? And you 're a psycho , mate . Are you sure it 's not Anton they wanted dead ? He knows all about Deel 's . Sprechen Sie Deutsch ? ( MUMBLES ) - Francais ? - They knew nothing about him . They would 've taken the decision to neutralise you within days . Please don 't say " neutralise " . - What have you done in that time ? - What have you done in the last few days ? - What have you been up to ? - Look , I 'm not an idiot . I 've kept my head down . I haven 't done anything that ... Well , I did see someone . But he was drunk . All right , his name is Gorski . Dobry Gorski . My old professor . I went to see him on Tuesday to ask about Tony , but he was totally drunk . - Was he ever with the Network ? - Yeah , but he was out years ago . He 's dead . Dobry Gorski . I just googled him . Hit-and-run this morning . ( DONALDSON TREMBLES ) What did he say to you ? Nothing that made any sense . What did he say ? He just said ... " Jimmy Deeshel ... " is a fat man . " What ? ! " Jimmy Deeshel is a fat man . " That 's it . Who the fuck is Jimmy Deeshel ? No-one . There 's no Jimmy Deeshel . It 's not even a name . I googled it ! You googled it ? And someone tried to kill you ? I would suggest no-one googles anything from now on . I know someone who can help us . Let 's clean up and go . ( MUMBLING ) This is insane . It 's fucking nuts . ( GASPS ) Becky ? Look , what the fuck do you want ? Right , that 's everything back in place as best it can be . - We 're ready to go . - I missed you . I fucking missed you . I used to check CCTV feeds , missing persons ... I 'd walk out of the office in the middle of a meeting just in case you happened to be passing . Every second , I missed you . And what do you say when you see me ? " What the fuck do you want ? " Right , well , when you put it like that ... Where is Jessica Hyde ? We don 't know . She had the manuscript , she took it to Milner . - That 's the last we saw of her . - Who 's Milner ? MI5 . She was on our side . There are no sides , just people who help you and people who don 't . Yeah ? And which one are you ? Why the fuck are we trusting you ? Ian , I don 't ... We don 't know who he is ! He killed four men yesterday . How do we know they weren 't there to rescue us from him ? All this is over , the Network is finished , and now you come along and you say that they 're after us ? But how do we know that ? How do we really fucking know that ? Er ... I think I can answer that . ( TV ON ) 'Police have identified the suspect as Ian Johnson . 'The victim , Joe Ducasor , an office manager from Peckham , 'was brutally murdered 'in what police are describing as " a frenzied attack " . 'CCTV footage shows Johnson slashing the victim 's throat 'before fleeing the scene . ' ( HE MUTTERS ) ( ANTON MUMBLES ) Are you OK ? Joe was a cock . He was a real cock . - So ... - We 've got a car . It 's nice . - You can sit with me , Becky . - Yeah . Or I could just fucking not . Ooh ! I can 't explain that . All right . All right , I can explain it . I slept with him . Once . I 'd just found out I had Deel 's , he knew all about it , I was at a very low ebb . It will never happen again and just thinking about it makes me want a vagina transplant . So I 'm just fucking telling you , all right ? Hmm ? DARA O BRIAIN : ' It means us waiting a few months for the vaccine , 'so that they don 't have to wait decades . 'Isn 't that worth it ? Support V Day . 'Say , " No , not this time . " ' ( HE SIGHS ) I asked to see her . Why can 't I see her ? Because you 're seeing me , dear . V Day is political suicide . I 'm on my way to be ... I can be PM . Now , imagine how useful I could be if ... We don 't need you to be PM , Geoff . We need you to announce that you 're backing V Day . We need it tonight . Just do what you 're told . Please . What is going on ? Where in God 's name is she ? Why isn 't she here ? She 's ... busy . MILNER : She 's not moved . It 's been eight hours and she 's not moved a muscle . ( SHE SIGHS ) We have fabricated a worldwide flu scare . We are about to manufacture enough vaccine to inoculate the planet . But because you have kept us waiting we now have just under three months in which to do that . It 's just about ... just about possible . I wanted her to talk . - I thought she ... - Geoff announces V Day at 9pm . It 's a starting pistol . It 's a big red button with " go " on it . If Philip made an adjustment to Janus , we must know today . Let us operate . Let us go inside her brain . Tomorrow will be too late . She 's all I have left of him . ( BUZZER ) Jessica ... We 're taking you somewhere else . ( HE SNAPS FINGERS ) ( THUNDER RUMBLES ) I think we should be taking pieces of the optic nerve and chiasma and the medulla and the brain stem . The optic nerve ? Really ? I mean , if we 're going to be in there anyway . We could even take the dorsal surface of the thalamus . So , this is a very powerful sedative , Jessica . - Why am I bothering ? - Oh , no , no , no . I am not using these haemostats . These are a mess . Do you want me to call the guard ? Why wake him ? ( HE GROANS ) I just think the basic standards of hygiene in this place are not at all what they should be . ( TRICKLING ) ( SPLASHING ) ( HE GASPS ) Did you see what I did to him ? He 's drowning in there . I didn 't need to go that far . But I did to show you what I 'm willing to do if you don 't co-operate . Are you going to co-operate ? Yeah . I need a back way . Is there one ? Are you thinking ? Think fast . ( HE GASPS ) It 's through those doors there , at the top of the stairs . Go on , then . What ... ( HE PANTS ) What 's down there ? It 's medical waste . You know , blood , tissue , body parts ... soil pans . No , no , no . Please , please , please ... the-the dose , it has to be precise . It 's very strong . Please ...

Well , I think you are doing ... really , really well . Um ... the Russian flu vaccine ... Remember last week we had to postpone the tests because there was an issue with the SOPs ? Well , the results have all come back , and they 're all stamped and dated , everything is fine , blah , blah , blah . But the watermark dates say Wednesday . And the tests happened on Thursday . - Oh . They must 've got the dates wrong . - Well , that 's not possible because the system is linked to an atomic clock . It was a big publicity thing about a year ago . So they just can 't be wrong . So ... why is it wrong ? Well , that 's why you 're paid the big bucks ! Hmm . ( HEAVY RAINFALL OUTSIDE ) This vaccine thing ... it 's sorted . I mean , I 've got somebody onto it , so ... You know , let 's not ... Let 's leave it . You and me . I mean , until I ... know more . Right . But I-I do know more . I pulled the previous reports on the vaccine over the last 18 months , specifically the thermal stability observation . And it 's weird . OK ? So , it 's represented by a number between 1 and 900 , taken every 18 days , right ? So it 's all ... fine . It 's just that when I compared it to other vaccines , there was an exact match . Hong Kong flu , 1969 . So , what , is that unusual ? No . It 's impossible ! Someone must have taken the Hong Kong flu results and used them to fake the results for the Russian flu . This is ... serious , Michael . - This is really serious . - Wait . Hang on . Let me ... Let me look at that . OK . Ah , right , well ... I see what 's happened here . I-I hate to tell you , but , er , you 're mistaken . - Oh . Am I ? - Yes . This ... this actually is the same , er , vaccine . See , you 've ... you 've ... ( LAUGHS ) you 've pulled the observations for Hong Kong flu . Oh ! Oh . Yes . My mistake . W-What an idiot ! I want you to stay away from this ! You 're scaring me , Michael . But , please , j-just ... Look , there are things going on . I can 't tell you . Just ... don 't get involved , please ? OK . Um ... That ... might be a bit late .

Yes , it 's real . And they 're going " Fat Man " on it , which is how they get a whole planet to take their vaccine . If the results of the fake outbreak are modelled on the real thing , think Spanish flu or worse . And was that one bad , the Spanish one ? It killed 50 million people , Grant . Besides , we ought to be working on the bigger question here , hmm ? Who the fuck 's he ? Grant , you said he spoke English . Does he speak English ? Hey , you .

Becky ? - Should we call Milner ? - Listen , I don 't know what 's going on , but Milner said that all this was over , and it turns out that that 's bullshit . And him ... he made my disease . He created it . I don 't want to give him to anyone unless I 'm sure . I think we should keep this between us , Ian . Me and you . For now . All right , then . Just me and you . And I did miss you . It fu ... it fucking hurt , actually . Getting on that train was the worst decision that I ever made . I just wanted to say ... very big of you . Understanding me and Becky . Our past . Becky has told me everything . And if you think some sordid little bunk-up years ago means anything to me , you 've seriously misjudged me . Oh , I wasn 't talking about the " bunk-up " . No , I was talking about the way Becky was trying to get the manuscript to me , you know ? Um , when she was with you all that time . The way she was secretly working with me to try and get the manuscript away from you . I just think it is great that you can forgive her , that 's all . - So you got it from this ? - Yeah . It 's just a nut from the machine that moves the tubs , but because it doesn 't come into contact with the vaccine , it 's not subject to the same security . And there was a study done last year that said that it was possible for vaccine aerosols to contaminate mechanical workings . So I had a look , and we were lucky . And you can test it here ? Yeah . I 've always had a home lab . I was born geek ! Hmm . I 'm sorry , Bridget . I-I 'm sorry you got caught up in this . You seem like such a ... good person . Shut up . You 'll make me blush ! Actually , don 't shut up . I really like it when you say nice things to me . ( BEEPING ) Saved by the haemagglutinin-sensitised erythrocytes ! Right ... Let 's see , let 's ... see ... OK , yeah , yes . That 's all good . Fuck , what 's this ? I think there 's something in here . What ? What 's in there ? There shouldn 't be anything in there . Well ... there is .

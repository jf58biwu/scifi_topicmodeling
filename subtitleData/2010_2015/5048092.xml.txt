 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... It wasn 't the marriage that I was trying to keep secret . It was me- - the guy I was before , you know , Pete the drunk . You 've never met that guy , and I don 't ever want you to . Charlotte Dupres , who , as it turns out , is a rival of mine . If I blow your heart out of your chest , you think that 'll stop you ? My lying , cheating husband is once again out in the world . But I have plans too . Good morning , Mrs. LaBelle . Hi , Terry . Oh , my God . Help me . I 'm burning up . His name was Terry Chambers , district attorney in Marlon , Ohio- - poisoned out of nowhere in his driveway this morning . Arsenic in his coffee ? No , he hadn 't eaten anything in eight hours , and there were no visible track marks . Cause of death- - muscle paralysis and lungs collapsed and heart attack . That 's why I 'm sending you and Pete . Where is Pete , by the way ? He 's at his yearly physical . Oh , God , no . Is it time for those ? Yeah , wait till you hit over 50 , and the real fun begins . What is that ? Oh , this is the last of the stuff that I had at my mom 's . Yeah , she needed the space . You got a flight in an hour , so ... Right . I 'm on my way . Hey , Steve , do you smell ... ? Yes , I do . Mmm , you know , uh , Abigail , it is spectacularly nice of you , but you didn 't have to go through the trouble - to bake us scones . - Bake you scones ? Oh , no , this is my breakfast . Yeah , they 're from that cute little bakery over on 3rd . - Oh . - Okay . Yeah , yeah , whenever Pete talks about that place , he gets a little ... - Drool . - Right here , yeah . Yeah , but if somebody wanted to do the dishes , I would consider sharing one of my scones . - Ooh , uh ... - Did somebody say " scones " ? Actually , you don 't have time for breakfast , because you and Steve- - you 've got a ping of your own . - I was kind of hoping I could- - - A 15-year-old boy went into some kind of fugue state in a park in New York City , and he graffitied some seriously advanced math on the wall . Ooh , that sounds fascinating . - Mm . - It does ? Yeah , don 't you think ? Okay , I 'm officially jaded . Really ? Because Abigail and I- - we were gonna flush out the neutralizer annex , but if you would really rather stay ... Nope , thank you . Loving the fugue . - Come along , Jinksy . - I 'll stay . - You 'll what now ? - You 're gonna stay ? Yeah , I would love to just unpack all that junk . Yeah , but wouldn 't you rather do that after they flush out the neutralizer ? No , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . I 've hogged all the neutralizer fun for 30 years . If Steve would rather stay , - we should let him stay . - Might as well . Yes , and I could use a little bit of action in the field . And I think you and I rather hit our stride chasing Beethoven 's bust , so shall we ? All right , Bilbo Baggins , you 're on . - Let 's go . - I have to pack , though . Oh , you go- - and I 'll go--yeah . Okay , what are you doing ? Nothing . Grip strength is the first muscle to go . Well , I know how important that is to you . Can I help you ? Yeah , we 're looking for Terry Chambers ' house . Ooh , Secret Service , huh ? I recognize that badge from the website . Are you here about the DA 's death ? Uh , Hummingbird Lane , you make a left- - 2141 , okay ? I 'm here for backup . Jeez , this place looks like a ' 50s TV show . What ? I have to do the other side . You can 't park here , mister . Visitors park in visitor parking . Secret Service . I don 't care if you 've got the potus in the back seat . I 'm Colonel Arnold Cassel , president of the board here . I 'll have you towed . Okay , you want to go ? Okay , wait , wait ! No , you 're staying inside . It 's okay , sir . We will move . We 'll move . Rules are rules , soldier . It 's a slippery road to hell once you start breaking ' em . Gated communities- - for when you really miss boot camp . A guy is dead , and all they care about are parking rules . - Talk about twisted priorities ! - Okay , what is going on ? First your hand-exercise thing , and now--then you yell at an old guy ? Oh , my God , you had your physical this morning . Is everything okay ? Yeah . No . No . Nothing . No--no news . Then why--why are you speeding up ? Okay , Mykes ... The doctor may have said that my testosterone was a little low . Oh , well , that means ... Well , you know , he--he said it was no big deal . - Oh . - You know ? But then I read online that it could cause infertility , loss of sex drive and ... ED . - Hi , there . - Hey . Janice Malloy- - 26 , right over there . - There it is . - Yep . And you are ? I 'm Agent Bering . This is Agent Lattimer . - We 're with the Secret Service . - Agents--I knew it . Are you guys here to investigate DA Chambers ' death ? Think it was murder ? Why ? Do you think it was murder ? I certainly hope not , but with what happened a few nights ago ... - To the DA ? - You haven 't heard ? The DA forgot to park his car in his garage , and somebody broke his windshield . Nobody saw who , but we all saw the windshield . Anyhoo , I must dash . Good luck to you . 26 , right over there , if I can help you in any way . - Toodles . - Eh . Toodles . Thank you , Gladys Kravitz . Do you think that I really need to wear- - Oh , uh , that 's a bit much , don 't you think ? Ooh , no , after what happened when the Warehouse was trying to grow , I am not taking any chances . Suit yourself . Pun intended . - Oh ! - Ugh . Okay , something here is dead . So ... A 15-year-old boy ? Yeah . Nick Powell . He did all of this in a trance ? Yeah , and according to two witnesses , radiating some kind of light . So when do we meet Nick ? You know , the--huh ? Oh , in about an hour . Nurse said he 's getting an MRI . I just--I see algorithmic physics . I see differential calculus . There 's code on the other side . It looks like C + + or Java . Well , maybe we should go to his home , talk to his parents ? Nick 's got no parents or a home . He lives over there . Nice box . I used to have one like that . Lost the lease . So , Rodger , do you know if your stepdad brought home anything old or antique-y lately ? Well , it 's Rodge , and--and I don 't know . Uh , my mom might . She should be home soon . What about his windshield ? We heard somebody broke it a few nights ago . Okay , well , you know what ? It wasn 't me . I wasn 't even here . Are you guys--are you guys really Secret Service ? - Look , Rodger- - - Rodge . - Rodge . - Mm-hmm . Uh , did your stepdad receive any threats lately ? Wait . What ? Threats ? Well , he sent 6 men to death row in 15 years . I mean , surely someone nicknamed " DA Gas Chambers " must have made some enemies . Wait . Are you guys saying that Terry was murdered ? Because I just thought he had a stroke . We 're just covering our angles . Dude , that is--that 's- - that 's messed up . Um ... I-I don 't know anything about his work . Right . Uh , thanks ... - Rodge . - Right . Um , Pete ... So I got the forensics report . They found sodium thiopental , Pavulon , and potassium chloride in his blood- - all of which are used in lethal injections . All right , so maybe it 's some kind of execution artifact in the hands of a grieving death row family member . Right , I 'll get Steve to look into those death row cases . I 'll go look into that . Hey , hey , what 's going on ? Hysterical woman- - says she 's stuck . Oh , help ! We 're stuck ! - Stuck to what ? - To each other ! So , Spencer , this is not your home ? Uh , no , it 's , uh- - it 's my parents ' . They 're in Miami . So you were just- - you were just sitting around , chillaxing , just kicking like a chicken ? Uh , yeah , just , uh , working . Uh , I just sort of reached , and then it just kind of happened . Pee-ooh ! Uh , what--what were you working on ? - Oh , uh , my website . - Website . Yeah . Uh , Spencer 's this , um , crazy web guru , and , um , I have this candle business and ... Have--have you two crazy kids come into contact with any strange objects lately ? - No , I- - - What about DA Chambers ? Have you--have you crossed paths with DA Chambers ? Well , my husband , Gerry , worked for the DA 's office before he got fired a few days ago . Why ? Just excuse me a moment . - Hey ! - Hey ! I know it sounds insane , but they 're totally joined at the waist , like siamese twins . And I 'm thinking , coo-coo-coo-choo , Mrs. Robinson . So you think she was fooling around with this younger guy ? I thought that they were working on their laptops . Yeah , right , well , that 's what he said . But I noticed his computer was off , and I saw him kick some motion lotion underneath the couch . So , while his computer may have been off , his laptop was definitely on . So Mr. LaBelle gets fired by DA Chambers and then finds out that his wife is cheating on him with this--this kid . Right and uses an artifact to even the score . But what kind of artifact poisons and conjoins ? Unless he has two artifacts . God , the stench . It 's like when something bad goes bad . Yeah , well , that 's what the goo smells like after it neutralizes an artifact . Relieving the pressure helps normalize it . So did you unpack your stuff ? Not yet . That 's not really why you stayed , is it ? No . Well , it was , but not only that , I guess . Okay , I 'll bite . Talk to me . I don 't know . I-I ... I guess it was a combination of saying good-bye to my ex all over again and then the trunk arriving . It suddenly occurred to me that literally my entire life is here now . I 'm--I 'm finally completely settled here permanently , like--like--like Pete and Myka and Claudia . - And that 's a bad thing ? - No . They say you get to share your Warehouse life with one very important person . And none of them have found anybody . And I 'm about ten times more shy than they are . I mean- - - Uh , Steve ? - I got to think about this . I mean , is this the kind of thing that I want for a guy like me ? Because I 'm already so nervous . Oh , Steve ! Watch out ! Oh , God . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . No , I 'm fine . I- - No , I 'm really good . I 'm good . Is there something I should do- - maybe hose you down or something ? No , no , no , thanks . I 'm , uh ... I 'm just gonna go have a shower with some shred of dignity left . Careful . Careful . So , Nick , it happened again , huh ? I guess so . About an hour ago . Yeah , you want to tell me about it ? Why , so you 'll think I 'm crazy too ? I don 't think you 're crazy . Forget it . If you 're trying to put me back in foster care , I won 't go . Whoa . No . We are so not social services , okay ? - So you can relax . - Right . Good . Believe everything you say . Well , you have no reason to believe everything I say , but I did go through the system , and I 'm not a fan . I know it can suck . - You were in foster care ? - Yeah . And I wasn 't about to go looking for any more abusive father figures to smack me around , so I did my time on the streets instead . Yeah ? Where ? Minneapolis , three months- - wouldn 't recommend it in February . And even that was warmer than the psych ward . Look , I understand being locked up for talking about something unexplainable--I really do . We 're the guys who explain the unexplainable . But , buddy , you got to talk to me first . I don 't know what happens . But before the seizure starts , I get , like , these visions ... Like I 'm someplace else , and I 'm not in control , like ... Like my body 's here , but my mind is someplace else . Hey , thank you . Look , don 't worry . We 're gonna figure this out , okay ? - Claudia ? - Yep ? Excuse me . Listen ... The MRI shows massive neurological seizures- - bursts of electrical activity that are ten times stronger than any epileptic seizures . This thing 's frying his brain ? Essentially , yeah . And if it keeps happening , it 's gonna kill him . Well , he 's home . I don 't think anybody 's told him yet about his wife and Spencer going to the hospital all joined up and such . Yeah , that should be fun news to deliver . Mr. LaBelle , it 's Rex in security . Mr. LaBelle , it 's Secret Service . Mr. LaBelle ? Agents Bering and Lattimer- - we 're with the Secret Service . What 's this about , Rex ? We have some questions to ask you about DA Chambers . Oh . Sure . Right . Common misconception- - running does not make you look innocent . Today is not the day to test him . - Now , where 's the artifact ? - The what ? Whatever you used to poison DA Chambers- - where is it ? I didn 't use anything , I swear . I-I just broke his windshield . Yeah ? Then why 'd you take a swing at me ? I panicked . I knew you 'd think I killed him . - I didn 't ! - You killed him , and then you went after your wife when you found out she was cheating . Leslie 's cheating ... on me ? How did--with who ? Do my kids know ? You smell that ? Something 's burning . Dude , you 're on fire . Pete , need to stand back ! Okay , Mykes , we--we got to find this thing . I mean , with burns like those , that guy could still die . All these people are starting to panic . We are back to square one . LaBelle clearly did not know that his wife was cheating on him . So , okay , what do we know ? We got--we got three victims from three different attacks which may or may not have come from the same artifact . Well , they all lived here at Crown Heights . So who have we met in town who might be able to tell us what 's going on ? Toodles . I 'll get us some tea . So , um , Mrs. Malloy ... Janice , please . It 's Janice . How long has Rex worked here ? Um , a while ... Maybe eight years . Hmm . And was he , uh , especially close with either DA Chambers or Mrs. LaBelle or Spencer ? Mykes , you got to try these cookies . No , I don 't think so . You know , Rex- - he always kept to himself , even after his condo burned down and he moved in- - His condo burned down ? As in with fire ? Yeah , a fire about three months ago- - Faulty wiring , I think . And then the board let him live in our rec room while he settles with his insurance company . Huh . - Mm . - Mm . Oh , hey . Hey , I--uh , you all right ? - Back in one piece . - Yeah , I 'm sorry that I just- - - I left you down there . - No , no problem . I managed to clean out the last filter before the , uh , nausea overwhelmed me . What about you ? Are--are you okay ? Oh , yeah , no , I 'm sure that the , um- - the--the goo smell will leave my sinuses in a few years . Guess that 's karma for me trying to mooch free advice . Oh , no , the Regents brought me here to help with issues exactly like this . And , um , I happen to know a thing or two about being alone . You know , I 'm a therapist . I don 't make a lot of friends at work . Mm . I imagine in the regular world , once you tell people what you do , they , uh- - they want to unload . Or they put their guards up , which is why I quit . No , it 's not . Oh , oh , God , I 'm- - no , I 'm sorry . - It 's something that I do--it 's- - - The human lie detector . Yeah . Yeah , that 's me , yeah . I meant to say it 's one of the reasons why I quit . I guess I don 't like to talk about it . You don 't have to . No , it 's--it 's good for me . I just- - You want to ... Sit down ? - Yeah . - Step into my office . So , um ... Two years ago , I had a patient who , uh ... I couldn 't help him . I guess I was afraid that it would happen again , so ... I quit ... and went traveling , just me and my camera- - another observational tool to hide behind . Physician know thyself , right ? So how did you end up here ? I was in Burma photographing political prisoners when I met Adwin Kosan . And he said he had a sense about me and told me about the Warehouse . Wow . He found me in New Jersey . You know , I thought I knew things , but ... this place ... Well , I guess that 's what we have in common . We 're a bunch of lonely misfit toys that the Warehouse collects . Except now you have each other . Maybe that 's why you 're so anxious about your things arriving . How do you mean ? Well , you said you were worried about not having someone to share you life with . Now it seems to me like you might have four special , unique someones . And for now , they might be your one . And it might be time for you to share a little more of yourself with them , which can be scary . Artie said you were good . None of these equations seem to be solving anything . " For all ' T' not equal to ' S ' " - - what the hell ? I hate having only one clue . Is he always like this ? Usually grumpier . He 's just distracted . So what is this place anyway ? Uh , it looks like it might have been an old NSA safe house . Now they obviously use it to shoot porn . Hey , that 's St. Jude , right ? Patron saint of lost causes . Where 'd you get this ? Um , one of my foster moms . There was this kid at school who used to terrify me . And Mrs. L said that I should pray to St. Jude if I ever had nightmares . I need one of those . Do you mind if I ... ? You still have nightmares ? Like a never-ending sci-fi miniseries- - about the psych ward , about my brother being lost , and more recently about this guy . He killed my friend . Whoa . What happened to him ? Ha ! You sneaky little bastards . No , no , not you , not you . I think I 've got it ! - Here , I need you . - Sit tight . - Yes , Dr. Frankenstein ? - Ha ha . Yeah , what hump ? Okay , so you--you keep seeing programming code . I keep seeing probability formula . It turns out ... Both are used by investment firms in their marketing analysis programming languages . Can I get the tweeted version ? Banks hire physicists and statisticians so they can create numerical price-hedging models . - Like derivatives . - And other things . And the bank 's employees are called quants . They 're quantitative analysts . You know what their work looks like ? - What ? - Exactly like this-o-rama . Nice . So it 's no coinkydink we 're near wall street , but what--what would Nick have to do with any of it ? Yeah , Nick ... Oh , Artie , he 's having another vision ... Which means he 's gonna have another seizure , so we should be ready . Nick says that he feels as if he 's being transported to another space , right ? If there 's an artifact and if a quant is somehow using it , we have to get Nick to give us more details about where he is , - so we can track the artifact . - Yes . Nick , can you tell me where you are or what you see ? I see a man 's hands . Yeah , what--what are they doing ? What are they doing ? They 're doing what I 'm doing . Yeah , they 're mirroring his actions--what else ? Artie , he 's already seizing . The downside of the artifact is intensifying . We have to stop this . We got to keep going . We got to save him . What else ? Um , I 'm in an office . I see a blue mug and some whiteboard ... A clock with an antelope . - That 's enough . - All right , all right . Okay , all right , all right , get him on the couch . All right , hold him , hold him . - You got him ? - I 'm trying . I 'm trying . All right . - What is that ? - Joseph Stalin 's sleep mask . It 's the only thing that would let that paranoid dictator actually sleep . All right , so there 's got to be some connection between Rex and the other victims . Well , maybe they all stumbled on to some secret , and now they 're paying the price for it . Mykes , doesn 't it seem kind of weirdly lucky that the fire didn 't touch any of his expensive electronics ? Janice did say that Rex was waiting for a settlement from his insurance company , right ? Yep , well , he should have had his testosterone checked , 'cause this weight is nothing . Ah . Pete , this is a notice of a secondary arson investigation . It says that they found traces of boric acid in his power outlets . Boric acid ? Boric acid- - it burns green . I saw it on Bill Nye The Science Guy . Rex burned the same color . So this is a cause-and-effect artifact . I don 't know- - he torched his place and went up in flames with it . Mrs. LaBelle and Spencer were boinking , right ? - Right . - Now they 're conjoined . One was an arsonist , the other two adulterers- - all being punished with their own sins . Yeah , but what about DA Chambers ? It was his job to put people away . Unless he did something unethical during a murder case which resulted in a lethal injection . So we need to start telling Steve to research sin-related artifacts ? Yeah , and we need to figure out who in this town is so obsessed with morality that- - - Colonel Cassel . - What ? - C-Colonel Cassel , remember ? " Rules are rules , soldiers . " And once you start breaking ' em , - it 's a slippery slope to hell . " - Right . It 's kind of a Burgess Meredith thing . - It 's very weird . - I don 't know . His cart is here , but he won 't answer . Colonel Cassel ? Colonel Cassel ? I got this . You call 911 . Yes , yes , we 're at 106 Woodpecker Crescent . Yes , in Crown- - in Crown Heights . Yes . Thank you . - Colonel . - How is this happening ? - How is what happening ? - Somebody knows . That 's why they 're doing this to me . Somebody knows what ? Did you do something illegal or--or immoral in your past ? Something- - What ? No ! No ! Colonel , you need to tell us , okay ? There could be a connection . Okay . All right . It was Kuwait , ' 91 . Our unit was stranded in a village . We were outnumbered four to one . We knew where the enemy was . The locals were harboring them . They had whole stockpiles of gas . We had no choice . We gassed the whole village , killed ' em all in their sleep- - women , children . God , forgive me . We should have died that morning . Instead , we got Liberation Of Kuwait medals . Listen to me . Okay , listen to me . Okay , when you said , " Somebody knows , " did you mean somebody here in Crown Heights ? I don 't know . Okay , just lie back . Relax . Someone 's here to help you . Just try and breathe . Mykes , someone here is doing this . Well , we better find out who before we have a mass exodus and we lose this artifact for good . How is he ? Well , heart rate 's low . Blood pressure 's high . I 'm getting erratic brain activity . I don 't think he 's gonna survive another seizure . We can 't let this kid die , Jinksy . So you think that this artifact is tethering him to a quant somewhere and doing his math ? Yeah , his mind seems to be going wherever the quant is . He described an office . You think this quant is nearby , or is he affecting Nick at a distance ? Well , it theoretically could be anywhere . These psychic artifacts- - they can work from afar . The brooch that Queen Isabella gave Columbus- - that could make you brave from across an ocean . Well , we 're hoping the quant is closer , obviously . Nick said he saw a clock with an antelope , so I 've been cross-checking with New York investment houses . Yeah , but why would a quant want to be tied - to a boy who barely knows math ? - Wait . Wait . You said that quants analyze a vast amount of data and apply them to numerical models , right ? Yeah , they 're- - all firms use them . Well , that would take a huge amount of mental capacity . You see , young brains are still developing , and so they 're more flexible , and they have the ability to make more connections than adult brains . So you 're saying that someone is using Nick 's young brainpower to help them do their work . Like a hacker borrowing a server . Not that I 've ever done that . Okay , what about Sir Isaac Newton 's cravat ? It gives the wearer insight if you wipe it across your forehead . The downside--it increases your gravitational pull till you can 't move . It does not create a psychic link . I got it . Four Wall Street banks have logos with horns . Only one has an antelope- - Armstrong Investing . That 's it . That 's what I saw . Guys , that 's Pete and Myka . We 'll keep looking . Why do I suddenly want vodka ? Oh , yeah . No , that 's just the downside of the sleeping mask . It 'll be gone in 30 seconds . But now I want vodka . So the tight-ass we thought had the artifact turns out to be a gas-spewing chimney from Mars . Okay , uh , we started with sin-related and ended up at biblical artifacts and the closest we got to divine punishment was an obscure version of the Sodom And Gomorrah story . It says that when Sodom was razed for its sins , a windstorm buried it in the salt dunes that made it so wealthy . Yeah , apparently Warehouse 3 agents feared that a handful of artifacts may have been created that day as salt-covered objects and took their shape . But it didn 't say what those objects were . But why is somebody targeting these specific people ? I mean , is it just because they live here ? Or because they sinned ? Everybody sins . There has to be another connection . I got it . - What ? - Mykes , look . It 's because they 're all Crown Heights board members- - DA Chambers , Mrs. LaBelle , Colonel Cassel . So maybe a disgruntled resident is targeting board members . Yes , but why ? And Rex the security guard is not on this list . Here ... You can read all about it . Steve , keep digging on the artifact . I 'm gonna go check out this last board member , Mr. John Foster . Pete , just be careful . And did you hear from Steve ? No , but I did find an article crediting Armstrong 's algorithmic trading quantitative analysts for their recent success- - " ATQ . " Got it . So maybe if there 's a section- - Uh-oh . Artie . Oh , no . It 's happening again . I 'm gonna need specific directions . This place is huge . Nick , Nick , can you hear me ? Can you tell me what you see ? I 'm in the same office as before . I ne--I need more . Something specific ? Door with frosted glass and a desk in front of it . Frosted glass and--and desks . They 've all got frosted glass and desks . Nick , what else ? I know you can do this . Come on . I hear that song from the " Kill The Wabbit " cartoon . Artie , I don 't know--he keeps hearing " Kill The Wabbit . " " Kill The Wabbit " ? " Kill The Wabbit . " " K- - " Oh , " Kill The Wabbit . " Okay . All right . I got you . ♪ ♪ Of course , Orville Wright 's aviator goggles . Take ' em off ! Artie , come on . Why ? 'Cause if I 'm right , they belong to the less talented of the Wright Brothers who imbued them with the ability to steal other people 's brainpower--never mind . You 're killing a young boy by wearing them . Come on , Artie ! Are you okay ? Okay . Artie , you did it . I don 't know what you did , but it worked--Nick 's okay . Okay . Lucy , you 've got some " splaining " to do . Well , that was way more testosterone-y than picking a lock . John Foster ? Hey , Mykes . I think I know who has the artifact . Last week the board rejected , for the third time , a petition from Janice Malloy . She wanted to erect a bust of her late husband , the founder of Crown Heights . What about Rex ? Rex spoke out against the bust , saying it would " Tempt vandals for no good reason . " So Janice is doing this whole thing over a bust ? You said it , right ? Twisted priorities , but , you know , we still don 't know how she did it . She might be doing it to John Foster right now . Oh , my God . Her chocolate cookies . What ? What--whose- - whose cookies--Janice 's ? When sodom was razed for its sins , it was buried by a windstorm in the salt dunes that made it so wealthy . The salt , Pete . I know . That 's what made ' em so good . Pete , w-what if the handful of artifacts that were created by the windstorm weren 't the objects that the salt covered , but the salt itself ? What if it 's imbued with some sort of power ? Salt from Janice 's cookies ? Whoa . That would ... suck ! Gah ! Gah ! Oh , my ... - Pete ! - God ! Pete ! God ! Pete , don 't move , okay ? Okay , I won 't , 'cause I don 't think I can . I think my legs are broken . Myka , go get Janice and bag the artifact ! - Go ! - Okay . Oh , yeah , they look good . I could lose a little weight here , but , uh , oh , they look good . Thank you very much . - Don 't eat that ! - Hey ! What the- - Trust me , okay ? I know what you 've been doing . Oh , my God , the salt--the salt covered a person 's face and took its shape . Shut up ! That 's what you 've been using to hurt people , isn 't it ? All for what , Janice ? What--a bust ? No , it 's my husband ! He built Crown Heights ! Get back ! Our whole marriage is about this place , down to naming the streets after our favorite birds ! He loved Crown Heights ! He--he gave his life to it , and they- - they want to wipe him- - they want to wipe him out ! Give me the mask . Just save it , Janice . It 's getting worse . Look , I bagged it , all right ? It 's- - Oh , my God , Myka . Oh , my God . Why isn 't it working ? Okay , listen , we just--now we just , uh- - Colonel Cassel , what happened ? They sent me home . As soon as I left you , I started feeling fi--good lord . Is he all right ? No , just go and please call an ambulance ! Okay , so we just--we just have to figure out what happened when he left us . Okay , what--what- - what did we do ? He- - We gassed the whole village , killed ' em all in their sleep- - women , children . Forgive me . We made him confess , right ? Pete , listen to me . I think that you have to confess , okay ? I think I 'm just gonna wait till the ambulance comes . You can 't wait for the ambulance , okay ? The only thing that will work is a confession , all right ? Whatever it is , just trust me . Tell me , okay ? I 'm--I 'm your partner . Just talk to me . - Okay . - Okay . It was when I was still drinking and ... I was--I was young , and I was--I was cocky . It was stupid , Myka . I don 't- - and I was- - oh , I was drunk , man . I was drunk . I got behind the wheel . It was an ... I was such an idiot . I don 't know why . I lost control of the car . I hit a tree , but I walked away . I walked away , not a--not a damn scratch . But my buddy Dave- - he--he got- - he got thrown from the car . And he broke both his legs . And I did that . I did that . I 'm responsible for that . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I ... That was rock bottom for me . I swore I 'd never take another drink , and I haven 't , Myka . I haven 't taken any . I know . I know . Pete , I think it 's working . All right . I could have killed my friend . I 've never been able to forgive myself . Just listen to me , okay ? You have come so far since then , okay ? You are a completely different person now . It took real guts to tell me that . I think you 've got all the testosterone that you need . - You think so ? - I do . So no more seizures ? No . Artie caught the guy who was doing this to you . We think maybe you ran into him panhandling or something . So no more seizures , no more visions . Huh ? - Yeah . - Okay . Uh , thanks . I mean , you 're awesome . You saved my life , so , you know , I owe you . Oh , no , come on , it 's my job . So can I go now ? Yeah . I mean , I guess . You 're not gonna call social services ? Well , like you said , we don 't really do that , and I would never do that , but where are you gonna go ? I don 't know . I 'll figure it out . Wait . It 's just that ... Why don 't you come back to South Dakota with us ? South Dakota ? - Why would I do that ? - Just for a couple days- - so we can monitor whatever the residual effects of this might be , and then when we 're done , we 'll fly you back to wherever you want to go to start over . Eh , I don 't know . Sounds like a trap to put me in foster care someplace really far where I can 't run away . Well , that 's a good idea , but , no . And I think I 've earned a little trust at this point , haven 't I ? Look , Nick , I know the worst part about where you are right now is that feeling that nobody cares . So why don 't you let me pay forward what was done for me ? Yeah , I guess we can give that a shot . Yeah ? Great . It 'll--it 'll be fun . You 'll like it . What 's that ? Oh , this is , uh , one of my photographs . I thought I 'd share it with everyone . - Taking your own advice . - Yeah . Well done . Hello ? - Hey . - Abigail , hey . Hi . Welcome home . So , uh , we heard you had to flush out the gooery . That 's a bummer , huh ? Did it barf on you ? Because I cried when it barfed on me . She did . Actually , it barfed on Steve . - Ooh . - What ? What ? What is that wonderful smell ? - Hello . Ah . - Hey . - Hey , guys . - Hi . Welcome back . Hi . Nice welcoming party . How 's everybody ? What 's going on ? - We just got home too . - Oh . Pete , Myka , Abigail , this is Nick . Nick . Hey . How 's it going , man ? - Hi . - This is a lot of people .

I know , right ? That is Steve . He is cooking . What ? I knew he could cook . Score . Oh , the man is full of surprises . Come on , I 'll show you your room . So how was Ohio ?

Yeah , I was just gonna put it upstairs . - No . - Leave it here . - Leave it . - It 's cool . - Oh . - Is that lasagna ? - Oh , that looks so ... - Lasagna ? Can I have some ? So , Steve-O , how 'd your physical go ? It turns out I am gay . - Mykes , when 's your physical ? - Don 't eat it all ! Mine 's coming up this week . Okay . There 's lots . There 's lots , Artie--plenty . The doctor will see you now , Ms. Bering . Myka . Did you hear what I said ? I said we could be looking at ovarian cancer .

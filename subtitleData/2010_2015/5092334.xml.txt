 NOLAN : Previously on Defiance ... AMANDA : Irathients and humans , they don 't have the best relations in this area . - ( GRUNTS ) - ( SCREAMS ) Fire ! ( INDISTINCT SHOUTING ) I see you made some new friends . I figured they hate the Volge more than they hate humans . All right . ( VEHICLES APPROACHING ) ( SPIRIT RIDERS SHOUTING ) ( SERENE CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING ) ( RUSTLING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( GASPING ) ( PANTING ) ( EXCLAIMS ) ( YELLING ) ( THEME MUSIC PLAYING ) ( BELL RINGS ) ( INHALES ) ( EXHALES ) ( INHALES ) ( EXHALES ) ( SPIRIT RIDERS APPROACHING ) ( HORNS HONKING ) - WOMAN : Look out ! - MAN : No ! When you 're done trading , meet back here . ( LAUGHING ) ( BARKS , LAUGHS ) ( WHIMPERS ) Thanks . Enjoy that . Cheers . Mmm . Ah , ah , ah , ah . You touch it , you buy it . I don 't wanna poison my customers . I lost a brother to that plague you people brought . Next one finds an eye . Did the Little Wolf think we were in danger ? No . He was . Right about that . Cute badge , Little Wolf . I wear it for Nolan . ( SCOFFS ) Nolan is soft . He 's blind to this town . These people . My offer still stands , Little Wolf . You should spend time with your own kind . ( RADIO BEEPING ) What ? NOLAN : Grab Tommy and meet me at Bissel Pass . We got a dead body . Trackers said they heard a scream , but they didn 't see anything . The torso 's chewed up pretty bad . Can 't tell if it 's male or female . Male . Behind the tree . The bones are all cracked . Marrow 's been sucked clean . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) - You okay ? - ( SNIFFLES ) I 'm fine . I know these shoes . Guy 's name is Dalton Taggart . He traded with scavengers for things like this . What else you know about him ? He ran a bakery , kept to himself ... And he liked to run . He should 've run faster . SUKAR : Isn 't this interesting ? Indogene . Castithan . Liberata . Sensoth . Gulanee . Even Volge . All the Votan races represented . Almost . If you 'd like to contribute an Irathient item ... - I would not . - ( SIGHS ) We 've had some complaints since the Spirit Riders started coming into town on a regular basis . Do they say we are stealing their children and fornicating with their livestock ? ( CHUCKLES ) I need you to stop provoking people . Our mere presence is a provocation . Your Spirit Riders helped us fight the Volge . As long as I 'm mayor , you 're welcome here . That may not be for long . I hear you 're up for re-election soon . Does everyone have to tell me that ? There are good people here . If you try to assimilate , they will meet you halfway . Most of them , anyway . Let 's put the past behind us . The past is never behind us . Irzu 's path flows through it and forward . But I will do as you ask . My people will assimilate . We will smile as we eat your food and buy your goods . That is , of course , until your people turn on us again . But by then we 'll be ready . We 'll know where you keep your food stores , your weapons . Perhaps then I 'll bring you a handful of dirt for this clean glass case , a reminder that the soil of Defiance is soaked with Irathient blood . Yeah ! Feed me . - Yeah ? - That 's it . Bring it close . Hmm . You like my cooking , don 't you ? Just shut up and feed me , bitch . - Hey . - ( GROANS ) That is the wrong answer . - ( SCREAMS ) - Ooh . Ah . Ooh . ( GROANS ) Do you know our safe word ? - Yeah . - Yeah ? - Calamari . - Very good . - That 's good , that 's good . - That 's very good . - Yeah , now give it to me . - Give it to you . - Ah ! - ( MOANS ) - That 's it . I want it . - I want you to say that you want it . - I want it ! ( MOANS ) - Mmm . - Oh , I can 't hear you . - I want it ! - I can 't hear you . - Yeah . - Yeah ! - Yeah . Yeah , yeah . - Oh , my God ! - ( MOANING ) - Ooh . - ( MOANING ) - Calamari ! Calamari ! - Ah ! Calamari ! Calamari ! ( CRACKING ) ( SCREAMS ) DOC : Their saliva contains Votoformic acid . Nasty stuff . Lets them chew through anything . That 's right , kids . We 're dealing with Scylla Formicidae . Hellbugs ? Well , that explains the weird bite marks . They eat marrow . Line their nests with flesh . How do we get rid of them ? Kill the matron . The rest of them turn docile , stop hunting and killing . Eventually ... ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) Irisa ? It 's all the blood . You expect me to believe you got woozy over a little blood ? This was one of your episodes , wasn 't it ? I thought you told me they 'd stopped . I just stopped talking about them . They 've been getting stronger since we came here . - You know they 're not real . - I know . - They 're posttraumatic stress . - I know . - And given your history ... - I said I know ! Found something weird around back . What is it ? It 's an empty hellbug egg purse . You don 't find them outside the nest . DOC : Unless someone planted it . Guess what I found on your girlfriend 's bed sheets , besides the usual ? An organic compound , also present on Bowen 's clothes and Taggart 's red shoes . - Attack pheromones ? - Ding , ding , ding . What exactly are attack pheromones ? Chemical markers that the bugs spray to guide the hive . You think someone 's directing these attacks ? DOC : It 's the only theory that makes sense . We 've got a killer out there , and his weapon of choice is hellbug . STAHMA : That smells wonderful , Christie . I just hope I didn 't overcook it . Nonsense . It 's perfect . Mmm . Isn 't it , Datak ? Votan river otter is a very difficult dish to master . ( CHUCKLES ) As I , unfortunately , can attest . You lay a beautiful table , Christie . The least I can do for letting me stay here . I was hoping my dad would join us , but I guess he was busy at the mines . I 'm sure he was . I 'd be busy , too , if I had to choke on this otter . Datak . It 's a Castithan saying . It means ... Excuse me . She 's been learning to speak Castithan , too . Thanks , Dad . Well , that was unfortunate . Well , her presence is intolerable . She insists on bathing alone . Who does that , I ask you ? - Humans . - Well , it 's not right for a proper Castithan household , for a proper Castithan wife . Alak must show that he can control her . And he will . But first we need to secure his marriage , which means healing the rift between Christie and her father . Hey . ( SIGHS ) My dad can be a GI-cho . At least he 's here for you . ( RUMBLING ) - ( SCREAMS ) - ( GASPS ) ( ROARING ) - ALAK : God ... - Get her out , now ! Move ! Go ! What in God 's name ? ( SPEAKING CASTITHAN ) Well , what are you waiting for , HANG-ot-so ? Where is he ? No , we have to go back . - No , we have to go back ! - Alak , wait ! ( DATAK CLEARS THROAT ) Perhaps we should dine out . Oh , Datak . Christie . - What is it ? - ( TEARFULLY ) Dad ! STAHMA : And dear , brave Alak , he risked his life to rescue Christie . A moving testament to true love . Thank you . Thank you for protecting my ... My baby girl . I 'd give my life for her , sir . Christie , you should stay here with your father for a while . It would be good for both of you . ( DOORBELL RINGS ) - Is that all right ? - ( DOOR OPENS ) Why , of course . NOLAN : Bertie , we need to speak to Rafe right away . I missed you . BERTIE : We 've got company . - Doc ... - DOC : Hold still , everyone . RAFE : What 's this about , Nolan ? ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Christie , you need to get yourself in the shower and scrub yourself raw , and somebody burn those clothes . - Why ? - Someone 's been using hellbug pheromones to paint targets on intended victims . Your clothes are drenched in them . But I just washed them . I left them out hanging to dry . That 's probably when they did it . I 've heard enough . All of you , upstairs , now . Move ! Why Christie ? Why my daughter ? Maybe because she is your daughter . What can you tell me about Boyd Bowen and Dalton Taggart ? What the hell do they have to do with this ? I 'd ask them , but they 're dead . So I 'm asking you . - Nothing that leaps out . - No ? Nothing ? Well , let 's wait till they go after your son . Maybe that 'll jog your memory . He 's at the mines . Have a deputy bring him here . - I need you to ... - Bowen , Taggart . All right , I knew ' em ... I guess . They were wildcatters . They sold me some land that they bought up , but that was nearly a dozen years ago . No dealing since ? They went their way , and I went mine . This property deal , you got any documentation ? ( SIGHS ) Bertie , we 're gonna need a lot of coffee . NOLAN : No disrespect , Mr McCawley , but this is one hell of a filing system you 've got here . Well , you try running a major mining enterprise for a dozen years without a computer , let alone a decent database programme . Ha ! I shot these when Defiance was still a tent city . Wildcatters all looking for that big strike . There they are . Bowen and Taggart . Scruffy-looking bastards . ( GASPS ) Where 's this ? That 's , uh , west valley , near the lake . - NOLAN : Where are you going ? - I need some air . RAFE : Hang on , I think I just found the deeds . Let me see that . Go keep an eye on her . - Help yourself . - Got it . Irisa ! Hold up ! Okay . So this deed matches that photo , right ? RAFE : Yeah , they bought it from some Irathient homesteader named Guzukus or something . Julluh Grisu . - Yeah ? - Yeah . What ? Don 't imagine a dozen years ago there were too many Irathient homesteaders who signed their names in English . It was a clean buy . They all were . What 'd you do to verify it ? I hired a bunch of powerful Wall Street lawyers , and we all surfed the Internet together , looking for a chain of title . What do you think I did ? Where 's Irisa ? She threw me off the roller . ( GROANS ) You look after yours . I 'll look after mine . ( GASPS ) Hide ! Irisa ? Hide . Hide ! ( SCREAMS ) Hey ! Hey , hey , hey , hey . ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) ( GASPS ) ( SCREAMS ) Whoa . Hey . Come here , talk to me . ( WHIMPERING ) ( CRYING ) Come on . Come on . You 're okay . - ( SOBBING ) - Shh . It 's over . Hey ! Come on , kiddo . We should go see the doctor . You see her . - You just had a seizure . - I know what I 'm doing . Please ? Okay . Another , please . Where 's the girl ? She 's behind the hellbug attacks . What girl ? The Rider with the facial scar . Rynn . I couldn 't tell you . Is that why you 're still here ? You 're waiting for her , helping her with these killings ? I don 't know anything about any killings . What about the ones in the past ? You took her in when she was scared . After Julluh and Ket were killed , you gave her a new name to keep her safe . What do you know of the past ? I saw it . By Irzu 's shadow . I need you to tell me where she is . You 've been touched . I knew Rynn 's parents had been killed . She said she didn 't see who did it . But sometimes when you are younger , you make yourself forget things . If Rynn is behind these killings , we need to find her before anybody else gets hurt . I don 't know where Rynn is . But she may . If she opens her heart , I can show her the way . What do you say , Little Wolf ? Gods of our fathers , help this one find the eye that does not blink . Set her feet on the path to see what others cannot . Help this one find the eye that does not blink . Gods of our fathers , help this one find the eye that does not blink . Set her feet on the path to see what others cannot . ( KET SPEAKING IRATHIENT ) Where are you ? At the farm . Julluh 's farm . What do you see ? Rynn 's mother . She 's telling her to call her father to dinner . Her father traps insects , studies them . He 's a scientist . Or was . Someone 's coming . - It 's them . - SUKAR : Who ? IRISA : Taggart . And Bowen . JULLUH : I told you , we 're not selling . YOUNG BOWEN : Well , we 're not buying . ( GASPING ) ( GAGGING ) IRISA : They 're killing them . ( SCREAMS ) I wanna help , but I can 't move . SUKAR : The past cannot be changed . Yours is only to witness . Calm yourself . Calm yourself . YOUNG BOWEN : Ah ! She 's running away . You see young Rynn . Now see the woman . ( GROANS ) ( GRUNTING ) ( PANTING ) I know where she is . WOMAN : That one right there . Yeah , that one . I owe you an apology . Look , I can 't explain what you did back there , okay ? Now , these visions of yours , if they are somehow connected to ... If ? They are real ! It was never posttraumatic stress anything . I 'm not like you . ( TEARFULLY ) I 'm an alien . And you made me afraid of that ! You 're right . I 'm sorry . Look , when this is over , let 's sit down . We 'll get to the bottom of this gift or this curse or whatever the hell this is . - You 're too late . - Kiddo . I don 't wanna talk about it . Let 's go get Rynn before she kills somebody else . NOLAN : Okay . If we find Rynn , we find the hellbugs . The plan is we set those thermobaric charges and we get the hell out of Dodge before they blow . I helped you find Rynn because it 's what the gods seem to want , but I will not see her harmed . Then you better make her stand down . One does not make an Irathient child do anything . A fit father would understand . ( DEVICE BEEPING ) Infrared 's going nuts . They must be down at the bottom . Turn it off . Do hellbugs have ears ? No , but Rynn does . ( METAL CLANGING ) This is the bottom ? I don 't think so . ( SNIFFS ) TOMMY : What is it , attack pheromones ? Shit . Hellbug shtako . Ugh . They see by smell . This 'll mask our odour . Come on , get some of this . Okay . These things must still be below us , otherwise we 'd be seeing a hell of a lot more of them . Come on . Tommy , try that controller again . Well , that doesn 't look ... ALL : Whoa ! - IRISA : Oh ! - ( NOLAN GROANS ) ( ALL GROAN ) ( DEVICE BEEPING ) NOLAN : Everyone okay ? - Tommy ? - I didn 't touch it , I swear . ( HELLBUGS SCREECHING ) NOLAN : Easy . ( ROARS ) NOLAN : Okay , it 's working . If she can 't smell us , she can 't see us . Nobody move . ( ROARS ) Looks like we fell into Hellbug Central . That elevator 's our only way out . The controller must 've short-circuited . - Tommy , get it working . - On it . Irisa , let 's get those charges set . We have to find Rynn first . Yeah ? You got five minutes . Tommy ! Circuit 's fried , but I think I could rewire it . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( GROANS ) Don 't ! ( GROANING ) I toss these pheromones , you all die . Drop your weapons ! Now ! Rynn , that nest gets any bigger , it 's gonna kill everybody in town . Is that what you really want ? You said we were one spirit . We are . Then why did you lead them here ? The Little Wolf led us . The gods have given her the sight . Her ? I don 't believe it . You and your useless gods . See if they protect you from hellbug pheromones . No ! Your vengeance is fulfilled , sister . Your parents ' killers are dead . And soon the rest of these humans will join them . I was there . At your farm . I saw what happened . I saw them . Your father . Your mother . How they looked at you . The love in their eyes . Is this how you honour them ? Yes ! NOLAN : Grenade ! TOMMY : Nolan , what are you doing ? Getting the babies to attack mama ! Rynn , let 's go . - NOLAN : Come on ! - ( GRUNTS ) ( ROARING ) - NOLAN : Tommy . - Got it . All right . Irisa , get it inside . ( SUKAR GROANS ) ( GRUNTS ) All right . - IRISA : Kill it ! - NOLAN : Got it . Get it going , Tommy . I 'll blow up manually . TOMMY : We 'll be clear in a second . Hold on . AMANDA : The land in the west valley will become the legal property of the original Irathient settlers or their descendants . They in turn have agreed to lease the land back to McCawley mines . But most importantly , with these two bold signatures , Defiance takes its first steps towards righting an old wrong and honouring the values which we 've come to stand for . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) I 'm proud of you . You shot me . You survived . I thought I taught you to shoot better than that . Your parents can dance with their ancestors . They 'd dance more freely if you hadn 't let them stop me . The Little ... Yes . The Little Wolf has the sight . So what ? So the gods touched her , and she in turn showed me what needs to happen next . I 'm going to prison ! How can that be the correct path ? I don 't know , precious daughter . Sadly , I lack the sight . ( SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) ( GROANING )

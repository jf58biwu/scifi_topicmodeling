 On the count of three , you will awake feeling refreshed , as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots , then brought back by bigger idiots . One ... two ... Professor , my Fry-fro is all frizzy . Okay . Well , that 's all . Oh , also , I 'm covered with severe burns . So ? What of it ? ! Well , why is ... those things ? You mean you don 't remember ? Nope , nothing . It 's like when I passed out in college . Except no one drew Magic Marker penises on my forehead . Well , I suppose it 's for the best , considering the unbearable horrors you 've endured . Let 's never speak of it again . It all began a few days ago . We were interstellar fugitives , on the run from the law . Fire all weapons and open a hailing frequency for my victory yodel . And so , as you and Leela kissed good-bye in a tender display of tonguesmanship , we plunged into a massive wormhole , never to be seen again ! Yeah , we 're back . Sweet Coincidence of Port-au-Prince ! We 're back at Earth ! Of course ! That was the Panama Wormhole , Earth 's central channel for shipping . How humorous . Yes ! It 's sort of a Comedy Central Channel . And we 're on it now ! I get it ! We 've lost power to the forward Gameboy ! Mario not responding ! Brace for emergency landing ! Roger that ! Activate safety spheres ! Also , mine has air-conditioning . Yet thanks to my trusty safety sphere , I " surblibed " with only " tribial " brain " dablage . " And the others ? Right here behind this horror cloth . Are they dead ? ! Oh , no , no , no . Much worse . Move over , God ! Prepare for rebirth ! Oof ! Oh ... wrong switch . Come on , stem cells , work your astounding scientific nonsense ! Fetal stem cells ? Aren 't those controversial ? In your time , yes . But nowadays , shut up ! Besides , these are adult stem cells , harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stem cells . Hermes Conrad ! Oh ! Oh , mo I 'm dripping with placenta ! Good thing it 's casual Friday . Amy Wong ! Ooh ... baby so ! Indeed ! Dr. Zoidberg ! Hermes , my friend ! Let me cut off your umbilical cord . Oops . And the rest ! Hooray ! We 're back in business ! Over my dead body . Uh ... never mind . Bender ! Are the stem cells working ? Ow ! I 'm dyin ' . I need mouth-to-ass resuscitation . I 'm on it ! It 's not working ! I die happy , knowing you fell for that . His power supply is shot ! He 's flatlining ! Only one thing can keep him alive . Possibly this thing ! Whoo ! I 've never felt so energetic ! That 's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts ! That 's ten times your recommended ... Who are you , my warranty ? ! That 's a good ... For God sakes , Bender ! Keep dancing ! Keep whooping it up ! You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as its produced , or it will build to critical levels ! You don 't mean ... ? Oh , but I do . If you stop partying for a single second , you 'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melted gears and splatter bowels ! Sounds like a party , baby ! ♪ Ooh , yeah , doo , doo , doo , deedle-ee-dee ... ♪ Hey , speaking of splattered bowels , can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight , Leela ? Where 's Leela ? Is she okay ? Why hasn 't she acknowledged my dinner offer ? Something 's wrong ! She 's not responding to my poking stick ! Poke harder , damn it ! I 'm poking as hard as I can ! I 'm sorry , Fry , but I 'm afraid Leela is in ... an irreversible coma ! ♪ Coma , coma , coma , coma ♪ ♪ Coma chameleon ... ♪ sÑaa My soul mate is gone ! Why should I go on living ? Because the pain slowly fades , but the love is forever . Yow ! But what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice , or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips ? Are you still hung up on what 's her name ? Move on already ! Maybe you 're right . Maybe I 'm always right ! " Build-A-Bot Workshop " ? It 's time to start living again ! At least it 's something to distract me from Leela . Nah . Now that I like , for some reason . I like jelly beans ! Do you ? I sure do , honey . Come , now , Fry ! You can 't live out this sick fantasy ! Not without our help . These security tapes record everything at Planet Express , including the ship , shower and urinals . And yet , it still hasn 't stopped the elusive bathroom burglar . Maybe he 's just trying to feed his family . Computer , analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela . Analyzing . Analyzing . Checking my eBay bid . Damn it ! Well , back to analyzing . Hey ! I was nuzzling that ! Attributes transfer . Shoe size 12 , et cetera . Brace for emergency landing ! What ? We survived the crash ? Oh , Fry ! ♪ Party people in the house say ... ♪ This is wonderful ! The last thing I remember , I was dying in an explosion . Yet here I am in the flesh , more alive than ever ! Alive ? You better tell her , Fry . Tell me what ? Anyway , my work is done . I 'm gonna hit the showers . Nibbler , come give Mama a hug ! Aah ! What the ... Bad Nibbler ! Bad Nibbler ! Aah ... ! ( grunts ) What are you doing , pooper-doodle ? It 's me , Leela ! Am I really just a robot ? I mean , I have Leela 's memories , her opinion of gazelles- - majestic- - her emotions- - confused and hurt . I swear , I didn 't know this would happen . The only thing I truly know is , I love you . I mean , her . Wait . Help me out here . Ouch ! ♪ ♪ Do the Bender ! Do the Bender ! No , spank you . I said do it ! The truth is , Fry , I still have feelings for you . But are they really my feelings ? Am I just an automaton ? Or can a machine of sufficient complexity legitimately achieve consciousness ? I agree . I need some time to figure this out . Until then ... friends ? Okay . Listen up , disco dummies ! You just flunked out of Bender 's College of Party Knowledge ! Yeah , baby . Uh . Uh . Uh . ♪ Do the back dance , do the back dance . ♪ ♪ Beedle-ee ... doo ... ♪ Good news , everyone . I 'm going to make one final attempt to awaken Leela . After all , there 's always hope . Really ? ! No , don 't get your hopes up . Frankly , she 's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus . Oh ! I didn 't need to hear that . No , and you don 't need to see this . Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Well , that 's it . I 'm afraid traditional medicine has failed . No ! I refuse to give up ! Wake up , Leela ! I ... love ... you ! Fry , stop . She 's gone . Dr. Zoidberg , can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead ? Can I ! That 's my specialty ! As you all know , Leela 's living will states that , in the event of coma , her body is to be fed to the wild cyclophage , a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses . Yup , that 's what her donor card says . Good-bye , my love . The beast approacheth ! To the beat , y 'all ! To the beat , y 'all ! I 'm dancin ' a jig with my feet , y 'all ! Bender , cut it out ! People are trying to have emotions ! You think I want to party ? I 'm sick of partying ! More partying ! Quiet , Bender ! Shush ! Cut it out ! Shh ! Bender ! Shut the hell up ! Bender , stop shutting the hell up ! Oh , right . Leela 's back , as if I care . Whoo . All right , Leela ! Oh . Thanks . It 's so nice to wake up and see ... ( gasps ) Leela ! Leela ? Leela ? Leela . How is this possible ? And can you believe she wore a tank-top to my funeral ? Shut up . We 've got to get out of here ! No , you shut up . We 've got to get out of here ! ♪ ♪ All aboard the party ship . There 's no room for two captains in this chair ! There would be if you 'd taken a spin class instead of lounging around in a coma . Whoa . This is crazy . It 's like I 'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself . That is what you 're looking at . Oh . How could you do this , Fry ? ! Uh ... coma ... sad ... I have to go . This is just too freaky . Please don 't get upset , Leela . She 's nothing like you . I have to go . This is just too freaky . I need cheering up , Bender . I don 't know . You want to go out and party tonight ? I hate partying . If only I didn 't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk . Why does everything I date run away ? I love Leela . Always and forever . And if I loved Robot Leela , too , well , that 's only ' cause she had so much of real Leela in her . I thought she loved me , too . But obviously , I was wrong , as usual . Wrong again . You were right . Leela ? ! Leela Leela ? ! Leela Leela . I 've been thinking , Fry . If I lost you , I don 't think I could stand it , either . I 'd probably build a copy of you , too . As long as Robo Leela 's not a jealous type like me , things will work ... I 'll kill you , you slut-clops ! Hee-yah ! He 's mine ! Oh , back off , missy ! Somebody do something ! Here , take this . A gun ? Do-Do I really need to ... ? Shoot her ! She 's the robot ! No . Shoot her ! She 's the human ! But-But how do I know who 's the human and who 's the robot ? We just told you ! Yeah , you idiot ! Okay , fine . If you 're gonna be like that , I 'm not shooting anyone . Whoa ! Right between the lungs . Man , that was close . I 'm a robot , too ! Aha ! That explains this growth on your drive shaft . But how is this possible ? Who knows ? Oh , I do . Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed . I 'll protect you , Leela . My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions . Fry did , in fact , save Leela , though at a terrible cost to himself . I tossed him into the stem cells , but he just bubbled away , like phlegm on a hot sidewalk . Leela was so distraught , she went all Blade Runner and built a duplicate . Then uploaded Fry 's personality from the urinal surveillance tapes . I sure love Leela . Alas , in recreating Fry 's adorable jelly belly , she had overstuffed him with copper wadding . The inevitable static discharge electrocuted Leela , and destroyed both of their short-term memories . So that 's why I 'm so amazed by these things I already knew . What could I do ? I hung up Leela with the other bone-bags and went to procure the final ingredient for my stem cell brew . Professor , my Fry fro is all frizzy . My God , I can 't believe I 'll never see that particular Fry again . Hey , where 's my shoes ? Fry ! Oh , I 'm sorry . I didn 't realize I was already here . Wait . What 's with all the Leelas ? ! Trust me , don 't ask . Okay , dork . Listen , I 'm gonna hit the urinal , maybe talk about myself a little bit- - Hang on . It 's time to sort things out . The truth is , I love Fry . That Fry . And I love Leela . Any Leela . We 're robots , and we 're in love . Let 's ditch these meat jackets . Whoa ! Cool ! Hasta la vista , wiener . We 'll be back . For our stuff . Why did their voices change ? That 's the one thing we 'll never truly understand . Uh , this is a bit awkward . Or is it ? I 'm not sure ... I lost track around the second robot . Well , you know how I feel . I waited for you for a thousand years . I can wait a little longer . What a load of mush ! I 've had it ! He 's gonna blow ! Party , Bender ! Party for your life ! No chance , high pants . I 'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond ! The cyclops eater ! Huh ? ( growling ) Hold on , Mack ! It ain 't like that ! Geez , what does it take to kill me ? Bender , you blew out your excess capacity . You 're cured ! Oh , sweet mercy ! My hellish nightmare is over ! I never have to party again ! Well , that 's that , then . We 're back , everyone ! Par-tay !

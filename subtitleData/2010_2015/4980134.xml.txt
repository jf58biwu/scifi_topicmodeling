 Stop whatever you 're doing , bud ! We 're having a crazy golf championship in the medilab . It 's going to be insane ! I don 't think so ! You won 't say that when you see the course . It 's amazing ! Best hole 's the fourth , on the autopsy table . The bath-lift takes you up to the tee . Out of bounds marked by the commode cushions . You have to land your drive over the bunion plasters in-between the two kidney donor dishes . Then a straight shot into the medical students ' practice rectum . Not now , man . Can 't you see I 'm cooking ? Steak ? What is it , pork ? I found a deep-freeze down on B Deck , next to Kryten 's quarters . Enough for me ? Just one steak , one chop , one rib . Great ! Just enough ! Catch you later . Hey ! I 'm loving this pork ! Maybe needs a little more soy sauce . Oww ! Lister , I 've been meaning to say ... Books ? You 've been reading again , haven 't you ? Lister , I 've told you a million times , don 't read , it messes you up . It 's like giving a hamster , who 's only used to his little wheel , the keys to an Aston Martin . Crazy things are going to happen . It 's part of my robotics course - I 've got to read it . Makes you feel so inadequate . You know Mozart was only five when he wrote Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star ? I wasn 't even toilet-trained when I was five . You 've barely mastered it now . How did these people get to be so great ? I mean , Shakespeare . I don 't understand anything he wrote , but , man , what a dude ! Plays , poems , and a whole bunch of expressions . " A dish fit for a king " - that was Shakespeare . What a great expression ! Is it , though ? Is it a great expression ? " A dish fit for a king ? " I say that all the time . " This is a dish fit for a king ! " That 's a great expression . I love that expression . Shakespeare , you 've got to hand it to him . He could really write a good expression . Who couldn 't have thought of that ? " In a pickle " - that was another Shakespeare expression . " In a pickle . " How brilliant is that ? You know what it means ? As confused as the mixed-up , stewed , spicy vegetables in a pickle jar . And how are we supposed to know what the inside of a 16th-century pickle jar looks like ? And how is that relevant to our non-pickly lives here in deep space today ? When will people learn ? Shakespeare , it 's over ! The money that guy must have made out of a few lousy expressions and a bad haircut . Bad haircut ? Don 't tell me you haven 't noticed his bad haircut ? But because he 's had a few hit expressions , he gets away with it . What 's wrong with his haircut ? He 's got a skullet . A skull what ? A bald mullet - a skullet . Bald at the front , mullet at the back . You wouldn 't want to go out in public with this guy . Sirs , the most incredible news ! Someone 's died , and you 've been left a new mop ? Ohh ! Please , sir , give me some credit . I 'm not the one-dimensional cleaning droid I once was . I 've evolved into something far more complex and multi-layered and , if I may say so , superior . Stain . Where ? Smudge . Oh , where ? ! Smear . Oh ! Speck . Oh , speck ! Smeg . Smeg . Smeg ! The crates were in transit , sir . I opened the first one and found this . What is it ? It 's a rejuvenation shower , sir . It rewinds each individual 's genome and returns the body to any point in its past . It can restore you to your physical prime . Oh , man , how great is that ? I can go back to last Thursday ! Ahh . What ? It 's Swedish . So ? It 's a flat-pack , self-assembly . We have to build it ourselves . " With just an Allen key and a Phillips screwdriver , " assembly should take less than three hours . " That 's Swedish for a week . It 's not a million miles away , you know . What about all these spare parts we didn 't use ? " Alignment bracket . " What the hell 's an alignment bracket ? Oh , look , we have taken this thing apart and put it back together a hundred times . It 's aligned , all right ? In what area is it not aligned ? In no area . It 's good to go , it 's aligned , let 's do it . Who 's going to test it ? Hmm , we need something unimportant and meaningless . Listey , you 're up . There might be something here . Bits of black plastic , bits of metal that don 't look important . Old battery . What we really need is something organic , something alive , something teeming with life . Oh , sir , what about your socks ? Stand back , everyone . They 're coming through . OK , I 'm rejuvenating the socks . Oh ! The beams . We 're getting covered in beamer light . They 're misaligned ! That 's what those alignment brackets were ... for ! What 's happened ? Where are we ? Damn cheap , Swedish , flat-pack , self-assembly rejuvenation showers ! Where the hell has it sent us ? I fear we may have time-travelled , sirs . And I told you those white plastic clippy things were important ! Trees ! This may be Earth ! Earth ! It 's always Earth with you guys . You see some trees , it 's Earth . Who 's to say it isn 't a planet entirely populated by naked warrior cat babes who need me to make love to them all ? And what are the chances of that ? If you 've never had a dream , you 've never had a dream come true . Hmm . We 're in a land called Albion , sirs . Better known as Britain . And the year is 23 AD . 23 AD . Weren 't Britons all nutters back then ? Running round sporting blue tattoos , out their heads on booze , fighting , vomiting and passing out ? A phase that doesn 't end any time soon , sir . Maybe we can stay . We 've got to get back to the Dwarf and find Kochanski . Ah , no fear , sir . I have the returner remote right here . Oh . It doesn 't appear to be functioning . Does it need a battery , by any chance ? Eight volts , about yay big . I 'll tell you what . We 'll make a battery . Out of what , trees and moss ? Out of potatoes . We did it at school . A potato , a copper coin and an iron nail . We can make a one-volt battery . Make eight , connect them up , we 've got eight volts and can return home . Britain in 23 AD , sir , doesn 't have any potatoes and won 't get them until the 16th century . Lemons ! The exact same battery but with lemons . Britain in 23 AD , sir , doesn 't have any lemons either . They won 't get those until the 14th century . He 's getting closer . So , where 's our nearest lemon ? Best guess , sir , India . India ? How far is that ? 4,000 miles , sir . If we walk briskly , we 'll get there in six months . Six months ? ! I can 't wait . Well , we 've got no choice if we want to get home . Let 's face it , sir . We 're in a real pickle . Mr Lister , sir . India is this way . Hey , it 's a market . Ha-ha ! I lived in the land of Albion for ten full cycles of the moon , but I fled after my family were dragged screaming from my home to a mighty wicker tower , where they were sacrificed to the three gods , Toutatis , Esus and Taranis . First they were garrotted to death , then they were burnt to death , then they were drowned to death . Three deaths to appease the three gods . Then the druids drank their blood and ate their meat and said the harvest would be bountiful . Right . Have you got any lemons ? They 're a fruit - they 've not been launched in Europe , but I 've heard they 've been released here . Ah , lemons ! Oh ! Found them ! Citrus , citrus ! We come from Albion , through Gaul , across half the Roman Empire , Persia , Parthia , all for this very fruit . This one here ? Is it famous ? No , not that one in particular . We 're in search of lemons in general . We 've walked 4,000 miles . How many do you want ? Eight . Eight ? You walked across half the known world for eight lemons ? You 're right , that 's absolutely insane . Make it ten . Have you got a bag ? What 's a bag ? Bags haven 't been invented yet , sir . In 23 AD , the rich have satchels made of goat hide . So what did everyone else do ? They drop things , sir . Right , what next ? Apart from new feet . We need copper for the positive electrode . Copper ? Where are we going to get copper ? Isn 't Britain famous for its copper ? Ahh ! No way ! I said we needed a shopping list ! Didn 't I say we need a list ? Hang on ! Aren 't copper coins made of copper ? He 's right ! I think I read that somewhere . Then we 've got copper . Hee-hee ! Next up , galvanised nails . And a shave ! Da-da ! Hey ! Finally got the sphalerite ore from a Chinese merchant . Three weeks for a few lousy nails ? Everything 's so damn primitive here . You have to remember , sir , that many things have yet to be discovered . In 23 AD , they still believed the Earth was flat , that Tourette 's and epilepsy were caused by demons , and an oxen had a higher standing in society than a woman . Where did the oxen go wrong ? ! They had it all and just threw it all away . Also , did you know that the colour purple is a luxury item ? It 's made from crushed seashells , and only the very rich can afford it . Colour purple ? What 's wrong with just mixing red stuff with blue stuff ? They haven 't discovered that yet , sir . Really ? Mm . Jesus ! Yes ? What ? I 'm sorry ? I 'm just ... talking to my mates here . Oh . My apologies . No worries . No way ! It can 't be , can it ? Don 't look ! Don 't stare ! 23 AD - this is when he was supposed to be alive . So how old would he be ? Well , let 's work it out , shall we ? In 23 AD , he 'd be ... 23 . That 's how old that guy looks . What 's he doing in India ? Shouldn 't he be in Nazareth or somewhere , making tables ? Maybe he 's on his gap year . According to the Bible , sirs , there was no sight of him from when he was a young child to when he was 30 . Oh ! So this is like Club 18-30 , the holy version ? The missing years - I 've heard about this . He toured the world , perfecting his teachings . I 'm going to get his autograph . No way ! EBay - it 'll be worth a fortune . You don 't even believe in him ! Look , this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity . All I 'll say is , " Sorry to be a bore , " I bet you get this all the time , " but you 're him off the Bible , aren 't you ? " What 's wrong with that ? Ah , Rimmer , please , don 't say that . Look , it 'll be fine . We 'll get talking , I 'll tell him my middle name 's Judas . One thing could lead to another , we could wind up big buds . Why is your middle name Judas ? Judas embodied all the traits my mum wanted me to have . Your mum wanted you to be a two-faced , double-crossing , conniving snitch ? She must have been very proud of you . She was a member of the Church of Judas . They believed that Jesus asked Judas to swap places with him , so Judas was crucified , and Jesus was able to show up the following Monday and say , " I 'm back , baby ! I 'm back ! " And nobody noticed ? OK ... Judas 's full name was James Judas Didymus . James means " twin " , Didymus means " twin " . Judas was Jesus 's twin bro . Jesus had a twin bro ? ! According to the Church of Judas . So Judas sacrificed himself . And his reputation , and became someone who was sneered at and reviled throughout history . Just like you ! Your mum was really smart ! So what happened to Jesus afterwards ? He went to the South of France with Mary Magdalene , had a family and invented the wheelbarrow . Here goes ! Rimmer , sit down ! Please , sit ! Sit down ! Brothers , brothers , I ... fear thou are impatient for thine food . Please ... join me . We are all travellers . Share with me . Wow ! What an honour ! Incidentally , we know who you are . Recognised the sandals . Um , I 'm Rimmer . Um , you can call me Arn or Big Man . Um ... talking of big ... big , big fan of yours . Big , big fan . Would the ... gladiator like to ... join us too ? I 'd be most honoured , sir . Although I am not a gladiator . I am a man of peace . Oh ! - Then thou shall sit next to me . - Oh ! Ah ! Ah-ha-ha ! Look at all this food ! A dish fit for a king ! You are all from the land of Albion , I think . I have visited Albion . I walked across the River of Mersey . All those old prams , it 's not hard , is it ? There was a bridge . Oh , got you . I thought you meant ... Ah ! Mine uncle . When I was returning from the men 's room , I spied two soldiers . Jesus ... they 're on to us . Problem ? Mine enemies are many . I will slow their path . Take him from this place and protect him , I beseech thee . You shall not pass while there 's a breath left in my body . For the love I have for my Lord is like a sea without a shore , like a sky without a ... I wasn 't ready ! I was still speeching ! The only escape from our enemies is to turn and love them . Or run . Running 's good too . Down there ! Look , this door isn 't going to hold for long . I must face them , forgive them and teach them the gift of love . And in return , they 'll saw off your limbs and stack ' em in a small pile ! What do we do ? We need to build the lemon battery , get back to Red Dwarf and go from there . What , take JC with us ? Well , we can 't leave him here , sir . No . Leave me . I must face my enemies alone . I have no fear of death . Stick with me , kid - you 'll soon change . Ooh ! Are you OK ? I have pain , but it will pass . No time to waste , Kryten . Start wiring the lemons ! We need wire . I 'll use my finger . The gladiator removes his finger ? ! It 's as if I 've smoked some bark from an acacia tree . Bad bark . Well bad bark . It 's ... Just relax . We 're just making a battery . It stores energy , sir . Electromagnetic interactions between subatomic particles . Or , to simplify , the copper coin , which is a ductile metal with high thermal and electrical conductivity , serves as the positive electrode , and the galvanised nail is the electron-producing negative electrode . The zinc is oxidised and produces an electrochemical reaction , which generates an electrical charge , all from the lemon . Interesting . I-I have but one question . Oh , fire away , sir . What 's a lemon ? Enjoy the moment . You 're no longer the dumb one . Thanks , bud ! The door 's going . Quick , group together . Tight circle ! Let 's go ! Lemons truly are an amazing fruit ! Man , am I glad to be back . At last I can get a change of underwear . These suckers are riding so high , they 'd show up on X-rays . Suggest we clean up and then return to 23 AD . In the meantime , I 'll have a tinker with the rejuve shower . It is totally amazing . What are you showing him , the TV ? No . A bag . You can store any object into its strange cloth walls and then carry these objects any ... I 'm dizzied by its genius ! Look ! Look at the things than I can ... Ooh . Oooh ! What ? Ah . The demon returns . Demon ? What demon ? ! The one that lurks within me is re-awoken . Lister , have you given Jesus a vindaloo ? Course not . We had a jalfrezi . Where does it hurt , sir ? My back . And when did it start ? 14 nights ago . It ... it sleeps , it wakes . Excuse me . Well , we 'll need an X-ray to confirm , but I think he 's got a kidney stone . We may need to operate . Is it life-threatening ? Depends who 's operating . 14 days . Sounds like the stone 's too big to pass . His kidney could shrivel and die , and complications could set in . We get him down the medilab , we fix him up , we beam him back to AD 23 . What 's the problem ? We can 't trust the medicomputer , sir . Remember what happened when you went for a mumps and rubella injection ? Yeah , I asked for a rube jab , woke up with a boob job . Still not right up here . So , we 're going to have to do it . But we 're not qualified . I 'm perfectly qualified , sir . After all , I 've been operating on Mr Lister for years . You what ? ! Well , not trusting the medicomputer , sir , what choice do I have ? What kind of operations ? It 's all above board , sir . I asked Mr Rimmer for permission . Well , sir , you remember that stomach pain you had a few months ago ? Yeah . You remember the searing agony you were in ? Yeah . And remember how that just sort of stopped ? Yeah . Well , that 's because I performed a splenectomy on you , sir . A what ? ! I removed your spleen . My spleen ? You removed my spleen ? ! Well , where is it ? I might need that . It 's with the rest of your organs ... in the freezer . Next to my quarters . On B Deck . Excuse me . So , this operation - what does it involve ? Well , we need to insert a laser and a ureteroscope up his urethra , locate the stone and haul it out . Kryten , the only urethra I know are Aretha Franklin . In English . Here 's a hint . It 's the last place any man wants anyone inserting anything . You what ? You 're stuffing stuff up his Schneiberhauser ? D 'you know who we 're dealing with here ? But , sir , it 's a perfectly standard operation . Yeah , that 's cos you 're not a member of the Schneiberhauser club . But me , as self-appointed president of the Schneiberhauser Owners ' Society , let me tell you , that is not a standard operation ! Well , perhaps we should inform him of what we intend to do . I think he might notice , don 't you ? Well , what 's the plan ? I keep him talking over dinner while you disappear under the table ? Best bet for a smooth operation - he 's out cold . I thought we 'd run out of anaesthetic . Who needs anaesthetic ? Just tell him what you 're going to do , he 'll faint on the spot ! Mr Lister , sir , could you hold this ? I 'm not holding it . I barely know him . Well , someone 's got to hold it while I insert the camera . Don 't look at me . I 'm done throwing up for today . Well , then , you 'll have to do it , sir . I don 't want to be a holder . Why can 't I be a shover ? You 're not qualified to be a shover , sir . I 'll hold it . It 'll be an absolute privilege to hold it . You what ? Pass the barbecue tongs . This is the high point of my entire career . Well , we should let him rest , sirs . He 'll be raring to go in the morning . Your kindness is boundless . Need anything doing , just holler . Books on the table if you get bored , computer games , feel free . Just the bag . Just the bag . Mr Jesus , sir , good morning ! Mr Jesus ? Oh ! He hath risen ! Ha ! Ooh ! Oh . Oh , goodness ! Well , who was the idiot who let him read a history book ? Look , I didn 't think . Didn 't it occur to you that him reading about how many wars Christianity 's caused might mess him up a bit ? So where is he now ? Well , according to the note , he 's gone back to 23 AD so he can trash his reputation so " this Christianity thingeth never taketh offeth-eth-eth-eth " . What , no Christianity ? What about Christmas ? We 've killed Wallace Gromit ! Trash his reputation ? How can he do that ? Breaking the Ten Commandments might be a pretty good place to start . So wait a minute . He 's gone back to 23 AD , and we can 't go and get him cos he 's taken the remote ? We do have a spare , sir . Erin , Erin , Erin ! Jesus , my boy ! Come , come ... I 'm looking for my uncle . Hast thou seen him ? No . If thou seest him , tell him ... that I will be in the tavern , drinking wine in great plenty until my legs do the dance of a newly born camel . And then my mind will turn to dark , vile thoughts , and I 'll start coveting my neighbour 's oxen ! That 's breaking the Tenth Commandment , that is . Oooh ! And if there 's time , I might even covet his donkey . And when I 've finished coveting things , I might make a small statue out of wood , and idolise it a bit . You 'd better watch yourself . God is a jealous god . You do that , and he won 't just get you , you know . According to the Second Commandment , he 'll wipe out all your descendants . Isn 't that breaking the Sixth Commandment ? Thou shalt not kill ? It 's not killing . It 's genocide . I think that 's OK . So ... doesn 't God break the Tenth Commandment , wishing people worshipped him when they worship someone else ? I mean , isn 't that coveting the followers of your neighbour 's god ? Don 't you try and trip God up . Look , he wrote those commandments in a rush . He didn 't have time to get them proofread . It 's strange , but these Ten Commandments seem to ignore the rights of women and children ... Shhh ! .. but are big on protecting the rights of oxen , slave , and donkey-owners . Keep it down ! I mean , it 's almost as if a man made up these commandments to keep a primitive people in check . There he is ! Get him . Ooh ! Jesus ! Stop him ! Stop that man ! Jesus ! You want to fight , then , doth thou ? No ! Well , put ' em up , then . Let 's see what you 've got . Don 't think just because I 'm a man of peace , I can 't punch your teeth out . I 'm not fighting you , Jesus . It 'd be like punching Gandhi . No , no . No , mind my hair ! You ... you 're messing with my hair ! Look , don 't do this . Why not ? Look , so some stupid people did some stupid things in your name . It 's not your fault . You make a lot of people happy . I mean , look at me . I presumed that , throughout history , all famous people were amazing . And then I met you ... and I realised they 're not . In fact , you 're a bit of a knob . Just like me . Which means that I 'm OK . Yeah , I don 't want to be me . I don 't want to walk down the street and have people say , " Oh , look , there 's the Jesus of Caesarea , " the guy who caused all the wars . " Jesus of Caesarea ? You mean Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus of Caesarea . Son of Rachel the fornicator , Samuel the chicken-stealer . Samuel the chicken-stealer ? He stole them , not me . Take it up with him . I 'm always having to leg it because of him . Um , is Jesus quite a popular name around here ? Yeah , there 's a few of us . There 's Jesus , son of John , with a funny nose . Jesus , son of Luke . He , er , wraps plant leaves around the feet of horses . About 70 of us at the last census . Does this mean I 'm not the son of God ? Oh , bugger ! Count your blessings ! It 's not been all bad . And how 's that ? You 've had a little trip to the future . Take what you 've learned and do something with it . Get your bags , genuine JC bags , people ! Come on . Get your bag . One bowl of goat curry , then we 're out of here . Hey , check this . I bid thee good day . Hast thou booked ? Jesus , table for two . My brother booked . It may be in his name . And his name , sir ? Judas . Here it is . Rimmer ... Sit down !

 1x10 - The Duke of Detroit Presents ... Washed up five times ... Overhauled the engine ... twice . Already cleaned out the storage closets ... 20 times . [ sighs ] [ all cheer ] [ alarm sounds ] We 're under attack ! Let 's go ! Move out ! We got bots , people ! Bots ? Oh , no ! Mike , no ! [ screaming ] Hey ! Chuck , get out of the way ! It 's a test ! It 's a test ! Jacob was doing maintenance on the alarm system ! Remember ? Oh , yeah . [ chuckles ] I knew that . I was just testing you . Yeah , that makes sense . Yes ! " Don 't let the car hit you on the way out . " [ laughs ] Classic one-liner ! Oh , I love this movie ! You have to watch that here ? But I didn 't get to finish because of you-know-who . Hey , we didn 't have to come here . I 'm not even hungry . Well , we had to do something . Yeah . Man , you 're driving us nuts ! It 's not my fault Kane 's M.I.A. I mean , look , don 't get me wrong , I 'm glad we haven 't seen a bot in two weeks , but I 'm going stir crazy here ! Is he plotting something ? What have you seen out there ? Actually , everything 's pretty normal , but it 's probably just a lull , like a calm before the storm . All I know is I can 't take this sitting around stuff anymore . I can 't sleep ! I don 't know what to do with myself ! You gotta learn to relax . You 're right . Let 's just order the meat maniac pizza ... [ crash ] Trouble ! Come on ! [ chuckles ] Oops . Maybe we should get our food to go . [ all groan ] Come on , guys . My body just reacted on its own . I 'm wired for action . Always ready to go ! Dude , you should probably try to calm down before you put anyone else in danger . Where are you going ? ! [ all murmuring ] Well , this thing looks dangerous . Let 's set up a perimeter . Dutch , help me move these people back . Mike , what are you doing ? - We 're taking it back . - What ? Look , there are too many people at risk here . Shouldn 't we contact the refinery first ? - No time . - But ... Do it on the way . Let 's move ! I guess he found something to do . Have you actually considered that this is dangerous ? Yeah , it has hazard symbols all over it . [ ringing ] Are they ever gonna pick up ? Come on , guys . We can 't just leave a trailer full of dangerous , hazardous compound out in the open . But do we have to take this road ? I 'm getting claustrophobic , man . - It 's the only way there . - Mike , it 's the refinery . Sorry to keep you waiting . Boy , it 's a good thing you Burners came along , because we have no way of bringing that crazy trailer back here ! Really ? But it 's yours . You don 't have a truck ? Um ... it 's their day off . Just follow copper canyon to the refinery , and our chemical specialists will place the trailer in a containment depository . Thanks . See ? Good thing we did something . Don 't worry . This is gonna be a piece of cake . [ screaming ] Activate thermal sensors ! [ beeping ] It 's a mine field ! [ screaming ] Yeah , real piece of cake , Mike . Oh , go left ! No , no , go right ! Left again ! Watch out ! - You okay ? - A little jarred . Okay , that 's enough ! Dutch , use your sonic blaster to set off the mines ! Oy ! [ beeps ] The road 's clear . I hope that trailer didn 't take too much damage . We need to pull off the road . There 's a rest stop coming up . Oh , we can pull over there ! I hope they have muscle malts . These babies don 't feed themselves . Roth , scan the other side , too . [ squeaks ] Why would someone mine that road ? Oh , it 's probably the same reason why someone would speed off with a dangerous trailer without knowing what it is . Because they 're crazy ! Because , Chuckles , it was the right thing to do . Not the mines , the trailer . You get what I mean . [ sighs ] What 's this ? I don 't know . [ mechanical whirring ] Is that a camera ? [ mechanical whirring ] Man , this place is the pits ! I could be back in my studio right now working on my stuff ! Oh , you 're telling me . I 've got three more getaway gang movies to watch . How can you watch those ? All those bad catch phrases . They 're one-liners , bro , and they 're awesome ! Oh ! [ all scream ] Can you get us Mike Chipton 's autograph ? Who ? Mike Chipton , the guy outside next to them gas pumpies . Autograph ! Autograph ! I 'm sorry , do you know Mike ? Yep , I do . These suckers are everywhere ! Hey , guys , you need to see this ! What ? " Salumatations , " Motorcity ! Don 't flip that switch or turn that dial ! 'Cause we 've got more action with hero man Mike Chilton ! Get back ! Ow ! He passed the first test , but does action man Mike Chilton have what it takes to lead his Burners the rest of the way ? Ooh-whee ! My gators are tingling ! I promise you the greatest show ever ! And here it is . We got spills , thrills , adventure , and so far Mike 's done us proud , but can he reach the refuge of the refinery ? Or will the Catastrophe Canyon send his Burners crying home to mama ? Let 's head back out there live ! And remember hotlines are open ! So tell your friends about this Motorcity exclusive ! 'Cause they 're gonna wanna see this history-in-the-making ! [ screams ] - We 're on TV ? ! - Oh , yes ! I hope you 're hungry , cause Texas is cooking up the perfect one-liner ! Show yourself , Duke . I know you 're out here hiding . " Bonjaloha , " Mr. Chilton , or should I say , our hero ? What is this ? What game are you playing ? I put you , the hero , in what is sure to be the greatest slam-bang , action-packed spectacle show in the history of ... slam-bang , action-packed spectacle shows . We don 't wanna be on your show . So just save it for somebody else . Ah , ta-ta now . Where 's your heroic integrity ? You 're just gonna leave ... how did you put it ? " a trailer full of hazardous compound " out in the open ? What if delicate , teenie-weenie children decide to play on it ? Oh , no , you 're not getting me like this . I doubt there 's anything even in that trailer . Oh , ye of little faith . Perhaps my associate cyborg Dan can help clear the air . With pleasure . [ mechanical whirring ] [ robotic grunting ] This is your fault , Mike Chilton . Uh ... See ? You can 't leave that behind . There 's no telling where it 'll end up next . Good , that 's settled . After all , what 's a show without its star ? Now get back out there and smiles , everyone , smiles ! Oh , Mike , one more minor bugaboo ... When cyborg Dan opened that valve , it broke the seal on the cooling agent , so you basically have 3 hours before the whole thing melts down . Could make a real Motorcity mess . Okay , have fun . [ mechanical whirring ] - How 's my face ? - Oh , Dan , it looks fine ! Well , this is great . All right , guys , so maybe I stepped into this one , but we don 't really have time to point fingers . We gotta get this thing to the refinery , fast . But then we get to be mad at you , right ? We 're on the March to meltdown as Mike and his mysterious Burners get back underway . Can they make it ? Let 's go to our woman on the street to hear the buzz from Motorcity ! Thanks , Duke . The feeling here is wicked awesome ! As people from all over Motorcity gather to watch the greatest show of all time . Whoo ! Yeah ! Come on , Mike ! Mike Chilton 's gonna show everyone why he rules . No one brings it like Mike . This is a slam-dunk . He 's taking it home all the way , baby . Chilton 's gonna lose . Heck , I doubt he makes it 20 more feet . No way , no how ! [ indistinct ] You know , I really don 't care if they make it . I just hope someone gets blown up . Let 's go to the overview map ! Chase this ! [ all cheering ] Here comes the mudslide ! [ beeping ] Sorry , Burners ! [ beeping ] Oh , yeah ! [ clears throat ] I just ran over some logs ! [ music ] Uh , no , wait . [ all groan ] Ooh , wow . That was the worst one-liner I ever heard . Boom ! Fire ! Come on , Chilton , keep a-rollin ' ! I hope you 're thirsty ! [ all cheering ] Thunderstorms , baby ! [ beeping ] Mike , the coolant levels are dropping fast ! Dude , it 's gonna melt down ! It looks like they 're in the homestretch now . I totally got this one . Guess we can cross this bridge ... 'cause we 've come to it , which is when you 're supposed to cross it ! [ music ] [ meows ] Oops ! Move ! Quick ! [ all cheering ] Mike , we 're at 41 % ! Do my eyes lie ? Am I making the greatest show or what ? ! Too bad he was not obliterated . It will happen soon enough . Mike 's days are numbered . Whoa , hold it there , Dan my man . We don 't want our hero getting obliterated . Maybe banged up a bit or a lot a bit . Sure we do . I am like this because of him . I have been reduced to a hot mess . Chilton will pay . Maybe you should get back to your report . Oh , sure . No one wants to hang with a mutant . I see how it is . Aw , don 't be like that , cyborg Dan . The Burners have conquered every catastrophe they canyon has thrown at them ! But is their appetite for excitement waning ? That Duke 's gonna bow down to my dukes ! [ chuckles ] [ music ] Get it ? My fists . Uh , yeah , still not hitting it . Aw , man , one-liners are hard . [ beeping ] Roth says the trailer 's down to 36 % ! - We are almost out of time ! - It 's okay , almost there . The refinery 's right up the road . We 'll make it , no ... problem . Is that the Duke ? ! Looks like perilous times for Mike and his burner brethren . Victory lies just beyond that ridge . Can they make it ? Or will they meet their maker in ... Don 't you go nowhere , now . The rafinery ! It 's on the other side of the Duke 's dome ! Dome , dome , dome ! [ music ] [ laughing ] - Oh , man . - Uh , you okay ? We 're laughing at my one-liner , right ? I doubt it . Listen , guys , you were right . We should 've just stayed home and play Laser Swords III . Now , is there any way to get past the dome ? I don 't know . But , hey , look , I did find the Duke 's transmission signal . All right , you work on hacking that signal , I 'll try not to get us killed . Uh , Mike , we 've got company . [ screaming ] What are they doing to me ? [ beeping ] We just need to hold out as long as we can while Chuck works his magic . Pain-bots ? I couldn 't have planned this better if I planned it myself ! Someone pinch me quick ! Or else I 'm gonna need new shorts . [ screams ] [ screams ] [ screams ] There 's an opening ! All right , guys , let 's get out of here ! Oh , what now ? Just , uh ... I 'll think of something . [ screaming ] Mikey ! [ beeping ] There 's no choice . We gotta go through it . - You found the Duke 's signal , right ? - Yeah . Let 's give his show an ending he 'll never forget . Gripping scenes out there . Tell me , Rayon , what are you feeling right now ? I gotta tell you , never come my man Mike out of anything . He 's gonna pull it together . Whoa ! Confident stuff ! Let 's check in with cyborg Dan , who 's over at Mama 's Boy central . Thank you so much , number 2 . As you can see , these mama 's boys don 't share that guy 's opinion . The terror dome 's gonna own you , Chilton ! - The Burners stink ! - Watch the face ! You guys clear with what you 're doing ? - Got it . - Got it . Say hello to my little plan ! [ music ] Hey , come on , that wasn 't good ? When I give the signal , do it . [ screams ] [ screams ] - Mikey ! - What ? [ beeping ] The trailer ! [ all cheering ] We 're out of time ! [ screams ] [ screams ] Ooh ! And ... kill it ! Wait ! What 's this ? ! Oh , no ! - Dude , what gives ? - Dude , did they make it ? - Is that it ? - Dude , TV sucks . Bring it back ! My finale ! My head ! No ! No ! My dream show ... it 's all gone . Don 't cry , gators . Well , maybe just a little . Do not be discouraged . I know you 'll make Mike Chilton pay one day . Not one day . Tuesday ! Which is today ! Chilton ! You think you can just destroy the Duke 's dreams like that and get away with it ? ! I destroyed your dream , you 've been trying to destroy us all day ... let 's just say it 's even . Oh , snap . [ growls ] Destroy you ? Maybe I chose you because I knew you would survive ! Well , I 've had enough action for today , thanks . I 'm ready to go home and do nothing . Nothing ? Ooh , I been waiting to hear that all day ! Wait ! What about the next episode ? " Mike Chilton versus the Hydro-bomb of lake Michigan ! " Show 's over , Duke . Oh , the show will go on , Mr. Chilton . You can count on that . Oh , I wonder what I looked like in action against the Duke 's giant head . Lucky for you , I hacked into the Duke 's cameras and copied the footage before I deleted it . Here 's a video of us taking out the terror dome . Hold on . Okay , here we go . [ all cheering ] Oh , this is the greatest show ever ! [ all sigh ] We terrored that dome a new one ! [ music ] - Huh ? - Nice one ! [ chuckles ] Not too bad , man . Boom ! Right there ! A perfect one-liner ! [ chuckles ] Mike , you hear that ? Uh , Mike ? [ snoring ] Looks like he found something else to do . [ snoring ]

 Will all the remaining passengers for the Express to London Victoria ... please make their way to A3 . Please remain in the terminal . Bless you . - Sorry . He 's got a touch of flu . - Yeah , it 's going round . Here we are , here you go . Just have a little lie-down . That 's it , yeah ? - Are you going somewhere nice ? - Just getting away for a bit . Somewhere no-one can find me . God , that sounds great . We 're off on holiday . - To the south of France . - Oh , nice . It 's a long way by coach . I know . It 's just , you know ... - the environment . - Yes , we should all think of that . I don 't want to sound like a twat , but I just ... You know , I do think that we 've all got a responsibility . - I just do . - No , you 're right , we do . We all do . - Why did you have him , then ? - Sorry ? Nothing uses carbon like a first-world human . Yet you created one . Why ? Why would you do that ? He will produce 515 tonnes of carbon in his lifetime . That 's 40 trucks ' worth . Having him was the equivalent of nearly 6,500 flights to Paris . You could have flown 90 times a year , there and back ... nearly every week of your life ... and still not had the same impact on the planet as his birth had . - Yeah , but I don 't think ... - Not to mention the pesticides , detergents ... the huge quantity of plastics , the nuclear fuels used to keep him warm . His birth was a selfish act . It was brutal . You have condemned others to suffering . In fact , if you really cared ... what you 'd do is cut his throat open right now . - Excuse me ? - Or I could do it for you . I could take out my knife ... make an incision in his neck , walk away . I 'd get my coach over there ... and you would have done more than your bit for the future of humanity . I could do it now . But look at me chatting . I think they 're about to leave . I hope he gets over that flu . But maybe he just shouldn 't . They are sleeper agents . Trained . Brainwashed . If I am chosen , I will receive a call . I will go to a car park in Denham . A car will be waiting . Inside is an extremely deadly variant of Russian influenza . Tell Geoff to announce V Day . Everything 's going to be fine . They know . So , we have to pay . - 20 million in cash is large . - A year 's worth of Thoraxin , Becky . It 's not a cure , but it 's taking care of the symptoms . Eat my fucking chip ! You turned me into a ghost . What if I did the same to you ? Run , Jessica ! Please ! Janus stops the vaccine from working . - No , that 's not ... - Listen to me . The flu vaccine we have is practically useless . - Commence . - Call him back now ! Stop him ! You can 't shoot me . I 'm the only one who knows who he is . No , no , no , no , no ! Milner ! - They 've said he won 't make it . - What ? Really ? - Jessica ? How 's she ? - Not good . She hasn 't said a word . She meets her dad for the first time , and he tries to kill her brother . God . Families , eh ? - What are we going to do about Grant ? - Oh , Dugdale said he 'd have him . Give him a stable environment or something . You know this is all your fault ? Well , you can get your mates to start putting it right now , can 't you ? Yeah . We should talk about that . The mother of Ian Johnson ... is expected to make an appeal today for her son to give himself up . Ian Johnson is wanted for the murder of Joe Ducasor ... and for the murder of Roy Johnson , his own brother . Theresa Johnson will be speaking later at a press conference ... in an attempt to persuade her son to hand himself in . Right , so , I just spoke to Leah ... and it turns out things are bad . The person Milner called is trained to release Russian flu ... from five secret locations all around the world . Now , we have no idea who he is ... but the plan is that he does it just before V Day ... which should give us 90 days to find him . But Leah says that if he feels his mission is in any danger ... there 's a secondary protocol . Tell him the secondary protocol . The secondary protocol is release immediately . He 'll start to get the locations of the flu canisters ... and when he has them all ... Well , that 's it . Now , he 'll be watching . The Network , media , everything . If the slightest hint gets out that we know , millions will die . Which means we can 't use The Network to find him . - Then how do we find him ? - Well ... We have to do it . Us . Look , there 's three of these men . The one that gets chosen goes straight into hiding . Now , I met one of the three : Paul . He works in a shopping centre . We go there ... and if he 's not around , well , then we know he 's the one we 're looking for . Ian ... We 've had our differences , and there 's things that I am ... sorry for . But we 're on the same side now . Just to be clear , Wilson . We 're not on the same side , okay ? Oh , and don 't start calling them " the three " , okay ? It 's not Lord of the fucking Rings , and you 're not a hobbit or a ... fucking space goblin , all right ? Okay , I can see two ways . So you 've got four people ... who need six eggs . You can work out how many eggs for one person . - Yeah , that would be four into six ... - What are you doing that for ? - I want to keep up my schoolwork . - Why don 't you join us , Grant ? No , no , no . You put that back . Put it back , Grant . - Grant ! You put that back ! - Nah . I don 't think I will . So was it fun being with them ? Did you get a kick out of it , Wilson ? Are you angry with me ? Because you betrayed us and joined the people that killed my brother ? I lost my dad , Ian . You do remember that ? Shit . - That 's Paul . He 's still here . - Fuck . So ... it 's not him , then . So we 've got no idea who we 're looking for . What are you doing with that ? Is that a silencer ? Jesus , Wilson ! - He 's trained to release a virus . - But we can 't just kill him ! It 's okay . Leah can cover this . That 's not what he 's talking about . You wanna just execute him ? You do understand what he 's trained to do ? I mean , you do get that ? - He 's not the one ! - And what if there 's another plan ? How do we know that he 's not some kind of backup ? And how long do we have before somebody realises ... - that Milner is dead ? - Wilson ! Wilson , this isn 't you . It just isn 't . Look . We go to his house , right ? We ... we break in . We find stuff out . But we 're not killers . - Nothing . - Piss on his bed . What ? It needs to look like a burglary . Piss on his bed . I 'm not pissing on his bed . Oh , my God . You have changed . - Here . - Let me see . With the new OS , there are glitches , so if he hasn 't ... Yes ! In through the camera roll . And that is why you should always update immediately . I take it back . You haven 't changed . There 's just one number . Dobri Gorski . Gorski ? That 's Donaldson 's professor . He 's the bloke that told Donaldson about Jimmy Deesh . Yeah , but he 's dead . He ... he died last week . Well , that 's odd , because he called this phone yesterday . - It must be available somewhere . - I 've tried . No-one even knows about it . It 's top secret . I even thought to reconstruct it myself ... but , er ... molecular chemistry 's a tricky fucker . I 've got about ... oh , four days ' worth left . I 've made a decision , Ian . I know I can 't ask , but ... - I 'd like you to be there . - No . - No , no . There must be another way . - There isn 't . There isn 't , Ian . And it 's my choice . Not yours . Oh , yeah . I 'd forgotten about all that . Turns out Dobri Gorski isn 't dead . - He 's in custody for murder . - What about the hit and run ? That 's who he murdered . The police station . It has to be you and me , Becky . Ian can 't be seen . I 'll call Leah . She 'll get us access . Jesus Christ ! What the fuck ... Terrence ? I wasn 't expecting you . Er ... not yet , I mean . Where is it ? There 's been a change of plan . I need the locations now . It 's ... It 's in here , actually , behind the fireplace , top left-hand corner . Two ? Just two locations ? That 's all I did . Trager has the others . There 's no need for a gun . No . No , Terrence . Please don 't . No ! Sit back now . What are you doing ? What I 'm trained to do . I won 't talk , Terrence . I won 't tell anyone . You 've still got her blood on you . Exista trei proteine diferite ... Stop that . Stop that now . We need to get to know each other . Do you understand that ? We need to communicate . She 's dead , Jessica . I saw her go . Don 't move a fucking muscle . Jessica ? Jessica Hyde ? That you ? I 've got a good grip on these tubes , Jess . Think if I yank them out , them doctors will get in quick enough ? If you hurt him , one second later , you stop breathing . Understand ? Oh , I understand . So why don 't you come round where I can see you , see if we can 't resolve this ? You 're prettier than your photo . Take your hand off those tubes and I 'll let you walk out . Nothing scares me . Nothing in the world . Except him . He wants me dead , Jess . I 'll count to three . You let go . I 'll put this down . - He 's not gonna make it , Jess . - One . - We 'd be doing him a favour . - Two . Three . Becky . Ah , man , I have such a headache . You got a boyfriend ? Cos I think you freaky ... and I like you a lot . - Are you okay ? - Yeah . So , they , er ... they picked Dobri up drunk . Said that he found someone , same age , build ... drove a HGV truck on his skull , and then he ... Oh , fuck . He took a hammer and a nail and individually cracked out his own teeth ... and put them inside the man 's head . What was he scared of ? Sort of takes me back , this , you and me . We made a good team , Becky . - So if you did want to talk about ... - Let 's just do this , Wilson . Please . You get me out of here . Please . - You 're safe . It 's a police station . - Safe ? I 'm not fucking safe ! I 'm not safe here . I 'm not safe anywhere ! - Why ? Who are you scared of ? - Fuck . We 're going to help , okay ? We 're going to find this guy . You think I 'm fucking stupid ? You 'll not find him ! You 'll never find him ! I knew this was coming . I gave my life to Janus . But now it 's here ... and I ... I want to keep my shitty life . Why ? You think he 's going to kill you ? Why ? - Why ... Why would he do that ? - I trained them . I know who they are . Dobri . We saw Paul Simpson . It 's not him . Tell us the names of the other two , please . We 'll find him . I tell you ... you protect me , eh ? You can 't protect me . No-one can protect me . Paul Simpson . Terrence Truman . Michael Johns . They are the three . - Now you hide me ? - Look , you 're safe here . There 's a whole police station above you . 12 SCO19 officers ... Oh , that will not stop him ! Do you not listen ? How could you do that ? How could you shoot at people you love ? The world 's full of love . Billions of people loving billions of others . All that love will turn to dust when our resources die . I 've seen what people are capable of when they feel they 're losing everything . Look around . Do you really think we 're so far from that ? Michael Johns is still at his job in an estate agent in Penge . We 've sent someone to him . And I 've also taken care of Paul Simpson at the shopping centre . Where did you say ? The back ? Er ... no , I ... I can 't see anything . It 's Terrence . That 's who we 're looking for . Two more . Great . Just one more to go . It 's a nice cover , this . - The fish stall . - Yeah , nice . I 've got a fucking Fields Medal , you know . I 'll be glad when all this is over . My wife ... Bad news . He 's killing people . Last night this man , Danny Silbert , died in the bath . An unfortunate lesson in why water and electricity do not mix . He was posing as a lecturer , but he was actually a Network virologist . Terrence 's DNA was found at the scene ... and then this man was shot dead this morning . Again , he was with us . John Trager . He was quite an accomplished mathematician , actually . We know these men visited Roseira , Ratanda , Laishui , and Hartwell , Georgia . Terrence is gathering the locations . He 's enacting the secondary protocol . - He 's going to release the virus now ? - It would appear so , dear . Call me " dear " again , and I 'll cut your face off . So who 's got the last location ? That 's exactly what we have to find out , d ... Are they linked in any way ? The dead men ? They were at the same university . - What , we have to go through all this ? - I thought it was best to be thorough . What would you have done ... in the van , if I did try and shoot Paul ? - You don 't think it 's ever justified ? - Where can it lead ? Look at Milner . Look at Grant . Once you kill , I ... - I don 't think you come back . - Milner said ... when she took life , it felt like she was ... bleeding inside . I don 't know . Maybe you can come back . I mean ... things change . Look at us . Well , we 're talking , Ian . Where 's Becky ? What the fuck are we doing here ? Are you all right , Geoff ? This ... is a detailed confession of everything I 've been involved in . I 'm getting out . Brazil . I 've got friends there . But we 'll never be safe unless we bring them down . This is explosive , but it needs to be corroborated by you . I 'm gonna give you this and an address , and when I 'm gone , you send it there . And you get five million . What about your wife and kids ? I 've thought about that , and I ... I think they 'll be fine , I really do . - And I 'll send for them later . - And , er ... my family ? Did you forget about them ? Michael ! What the fuck are you doing ? What the fuck are you doing ? Jesus Christ ! Stop it ! You ! You listen to me , you weaselly gobshite ! You dragged me screaming into this filth ... and now you want me to get you out ? Well , you 're gonna stay where you are . You get it ? You 're gonna stay smiling , grinning ... do what you 're told , or I 'll fucking kill you myself ! - What are you doing ? - French . French ? French don 't stop bullets . - French won 't fucking help you when ... - Grant . Stand up and come here . I asked you to come here . Now , you 're a young man . I can 't tell you what to do or what to say ... but I do not want you scaring Alice . Do you understand ? - I asked if you understood . - Yeah . Sorry . And while you 're in this house , you will not turn the air blue . You got it ? - Sorry , Mrs. Dugdale . - Now I want you to go upstairs ... get the knife , and bring it back down to the kitchen where it belongs . And behave ! Yes , Mrs. Dugdale . And Grant ? You can call me Jen . You didn 't tell her about us . I 'm sorry about your brother , Ian . Thank you . - I 'm sorry about yours . - He 's fighting like a bastard . Is it weird to say I 'm proud of him ? Why didn 't you tell her ? It didn 't seem right . That 's fair . I understand . There 's a cupboard over there . - What ? - We could go inside . - You and me . - Are you serious ? There 's nothing wrong with two people in pain holding onto each other . Jesus fucking Christ , Jessica . I 'm with Becky . Okay ? I 'm with Becky . But not for long . We both know that . I found it . I ... I fucking found it ! Okay , we 've been looking for connections with other students : Mathematicians , virologists and whatnot , right ? Well , it turns out Donaldson studied there too ... and guess who was a professor to all three of them ? Oh , Christ . Dobri . Dobri Gorski . Help me ! Help me ! Get me out of here ! Get me ... ! There was a break-in at Dobri 's house last night . It 's safe to assume Terrence now has the last location . Oh , my God . So , he ... he 's gonna go Fat Man on him ? - Now ? It 's actually happening ? - No , no . No , no . - This is good news . - How the fuck is this good news ? Don 't you understand ? This is an opportunity . He will release the virus here first . So he 's on his way to Denham right now . How does that help ? We know it 's a car park . But which one ? Dobri was there . He will have parked . We check his credit card . But what if he paid cash ? Then we are all very fucked , dear . They know where Terrence is going . We 're closest , Jessica . It 's a car park in Denham . They think he 's going there right now . I can 't leave him alone . - I can 't leave him . - Look , the others are coming back . They 'll be 40 minutes . I can 't do this on my own . Jessica , please . Release ... Release ... Release ... I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . Terrence ? What are you doing ? Terrence , please . Terrence , don 't release it ! The vaccine doesn 't work . It 's gonna kill millions . Don 't . Don 't ! Please . Terrence ! Terrence ! Please . What can you see ? Marius . He 's ... he 's just grinning at me , Ian . Hey . Hey , look at me . Just look at me . Has he gone ? Come here . This ... is Nembutal . Strictly speaking , I should take it with an anti-emetic ... - but I think it should be okay . - Jesus Christ , Becky . Please stop . No . It 's today . I 'm doing it today . I 've only got two days of Thoraxin left . I just want to spend my last hours with someone I love . Now , I know it 's too much to ask of you . But I am asking . - Okay . - Thank you . Okay , everything 's arranged . Er ... Jen , I 've done the dishes . Er ... do you want anything else doing ? Er ... no . Why don 't you go in with Alice and do some schoolwork ? It 's ... it 's okay , Grant . She 'll help you . - Yeah , okay , okay . - Okay . - Hello , Mr. Dugdale . - Er ... yeah , hello . Hello , hello , Grant . Yeah , I don 't understand it either . Let 's not question it . - So ... we 're all go , then ? - We leave today . We 're meeting Wilson later . He 's got them to get us new passports , IDs , everything . It 'll be another country tomorrow . It 's a whole new life for all of us . This is the right thing . Okay . That 's it . All ready to go . Did they manage to pick up the other canisters ? - The virus ? - They did . The locations Terrence had were right . So that 's all ... I can 't believe Milner , thinking it 's okay to lose so many lives . Well , don 't try and figure her out , Wilson . You 'll go fucking nuts . That thinking , though . I mean , losing that much life is never acceptable . But losing some is . There are villages and towns in remote places - islands , deserts accessed by one road - places where a virus could be released ... and controlled , without risk of spread to the wider population . See , she was wrong , Michael . You don 't need a pandemic for people to take the vaccine . You just need the fear of a pandemic . Have you got our IDs ? We ... we just want to go now . We have a flight to ... I 'm afraid that 's not on any more . We 're gonna need you to go home . " We " ? On my command , that man will start to execute your family . Grant first , then Alice . Finally Jen . There are people putting cameras up in your house , your work ... where you get your coffee , right now . We 're going to tag you this time . We 're going to make sure you 're watched 100 % . You 'll be watched in your sleep . We have to do this , Michael . Look at Alice and Grant . What kind of future do you want for people like them ? Wilson . Jesus Christ . - Don 't ... - I promise you , I 'll be better than her . When all this is done , I 'll let you go . All of you . Count on that . Wilson , Wilson . Wilson . Don 't ... don 't do this . - Please . This is not you . - No . I don 't think I am me . Not any more . Take your family home . Now . - You are filthy . - I 'm getting up . Go and get me a drink . - I 'm just getting some champagne . - You ... you 're doing amazing . I saw you laughing . It 's great . - Well , I didn 't expect you here . - I ... I just wanted to say bye . - Are you scared , Becky ? - Yeah . Sort of ... terrified . But I know it 's what I want . And you think this is right ? For him , I mean ? Have you ever looked into the eyes of someone you love who 's dying ? It 's not something that leaves you . You wanted to see me ? Am I supposed to be scared ? So , revenge , is it ? This isn 't you , Wilson . You 're not this . There 's no reason to kill me , and we both know you need a ... Ah ... she must stop . What ? Anton , are you ... Are you all right ? You asked me to reconstruct this ... what , Thoraxin ? - Yeah , yes . - It doesn 't exist . There is no Thoraxin . - She must stop taking it . - But then what is it ? Well ... It ... it 's a rather complex opiate . It 's mildly addictive . Somewhere between heroin and caffeine . - Hallucinatory as she took more . - It 's ... No , no , hang on . She had ... - What ? - She had shakes , tremors . She had fits . Yes , yes . Withdrawal . It was withdrawal . So is she ill ? Well , she has the genetic mutation . But I have no reason to believe it has triggered . I think she 's well . - An opiate ? - Yes . - Why would Donaldson do that ? - Well , there are bad people in this world . People who need to control others . Becky ! Becky , I just ... No , no , no . Becky ? Becky ! Becky ! Becky ! Becky ? Becky ... No . No , no , no . Come on . Becky . - Come with us now . - What ? Please . That 's it , that 's it . It 's okay . It 's okay . That 's it . That 's it . That 's it , you 're okay . You 're okay . You 're not ill . You 're not sick . It 's okay . What the fuck ? Becky ! Becky ! Get the fuck off me ! Becky ! Becky ! Becky !

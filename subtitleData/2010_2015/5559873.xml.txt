 crossing dimensions of time and space technology beyond comprehension they are watching they are waiting day of old reading year official explanation was that nothing had come down to the ground we 've eliminated everything have kicks Burke Pennsylvania 1965 in a Dec marked by conflict and unrest this tiny hamlet in the hills southeast of Pittsburgh remains untouched by the troubles in the outside world until the evening of December 9th for local residents Dan Gordon this night marks the beginning of a lifelong journey I remember that evening quite well I was 16 years old I 'll I was actually tuned into kdka radio in Pittsburgh I 'll those a great radio throw that was quite educational and I you so listen hours every night if you choose to million folks a true story which about streetlight speaking this the reports initially k members bright fireball be in seen from the to provide carry over Michigan Ohio and Pennsylvania from the calls were getting you history over the state with Westwood County so keep your eyes it was good spoke style on the edge of town for rule truck driver build you a Bosch tinkers with his prized possession that was under the word in and I could hear this system noise and I looked at a car there were day now from car that the messiness speaker farm sis of it was up about mom after you mom i watch sydney went towards to mom name went up there so for in a turn around and come back again in it seemed like it to make up his mind where my you know of goods that the object school and capers breaking in with my records that a man identified flying object to report leaf on the vote for tax bird latest on waylaid situation local police have been dispatched to the scene is called to when the phone lines here include at work lead after a word from our Sponsors I remember that night out running back and forth between the TV in a radio funneled into the latest reports in the different sources if I know what was going on there was some fight that maybe there 's something on the airplane the made-up split in the sky out towards grease workforce Westmont Tony as you can see the curious gathered here on slaying here exper they like us are hoping to find out one exactly has landed in these words home I got in the car and I went through other home you couldn 't get near the place for automobiles and have named William it up very nice years old people 104 cruising the kicks per hills in his new car William Weaver tunes into the local radio stations what I was 19 years old at the time and I heard on the radio that something has landed there and cycle on the hill I seem to people standing of on the side of the road I stopped in Aspen and everybody was wondering you know home whizzes would happen is it an airplane no they had no idea if looking down over the hill as it was getting dark I could see that there was a blue like coming for this that would go very tall name get very bright inning go back to getting very dole it is very busy agassi lights down there you know I 'm in the woods group lakes Park version like some kind a scum reforming so far authorities at airports from Pittsburgh to philadelphia harm of for me not morning any missing aircraft whatever has crashed into the sport appears to have been flying without a fight more more calls for coming in through the radio stations who were see his gf driving for the sake of the election home seem very intriguing miss you can see why wouldn 't there be coming in here unless they felt that there was some reason to come out at night here because the army they were all there guns and everything they can barely hear you here reno they 're able to observe apart from the ongoing military activity is a strange blue glow emanating from the site I don 't think anybody Mary you never seen that many soldiers and get expert there was no bluff involved in with they were making the people do he told me back my car out there he get on there right away see the new movie around confiscate your core the military has blocked off all incoming raw soldiers and state police are not allowing anyone these some people have gone on record said soldiers actually came to weapons at civilians prevented from going down into the area why would so many military personnel centers small farming community with warm soldiers gaming weapons at certain civilians trying to get down to the site were there too risky to come from and what was so important downward the day one home C Wed the next day I was he really awaiting the newspapers I was trying to get ahold of all the local additions morning paper had ending army ropes of area unidentified flying object father expert the search they claim continued about 2 a.m. however a later addition at the heading searches dollar fine object it was being stated that people had been mistaken nothing and fall on it seems just a break media or in the sky of Air Force made a statement that this was a meteor in other words that nothing came down at night they said that a three-man team went out to investigate something that started the fire and searched the area and came back at 2 a.m. and found nothing had seen it they paid turn right into the woods I could see that there was a blue like coming of age and this one on the whole time that I was there of the only official Air Force document that was ever locate on the cake against and suggest that there was only three air force personnel involved of get more of the 22 by witnesses including reporters verify the fact that there was a fairly good military presence various types and military equipment in person now and trucks were observed in different areas around the village that evening here for state completely contradicts what the witnesses have said what the media reported the night of the event I hesitated just accuse a government agency able to cover up to Sir outright but I do think it 's a possibility what 's the military keeping from the people love text Berg to white it and who else is involved in the possible cover-up on December 9th 1965 after reports that a fiery object crashed into the woods time community expert Pennsylvania is overrun by military personnel the military has spawned of all income there has been no reason given this latest this the following day newspapers report that nothing was found official explanation was business to meet your that nothing had come down to the ground but the official story doesn 't match up with what John Hayes song across town no information the military presence Westmoreland County continues to response to reports this fiery object numbers in the woods against your G I was 10 years old hands period on them though farmhouse in tax burden we listen to radio whole time school convoy military vehicles has been spotty heading to the east side stay tuned were worth that you 're here we and our house using there was a feels its my bedroom with two faced iraq I could see people come in and driveway cars being parked I can see flashing lights by you can tell who they were what kind of vehicle was my dad when I have fun though on was most is my dad came back in he was a land I was military people with them my house was converted into military base for ok John white this good at the Wyndham you I seems guys there 's an lines suitor whatever q1 calm its when they was talking to each other I seen in the house patch told I thought you know habits that was pretty crazy assets job during that time period was too deal with anything that fell from space any debris hear anything unexplained nasa would go to the scene and retrieve the thing cell if the statement released by the Air Force is true and nothing was found at the crash site words way is nasa doing Inc expert of day had a box while make bombs is probably about 44 while about a file then it popped out through the field and down to the corner who is over everything was gone this may surprise stop pestering me when I was looking out my bedroom window I was watching the cars and stuff like come on our money driveway just so what 's what 's going on out there this through front which is the a flatbed truck was empty there 's probably down there for half hour its and they came back out was something on the back and a truck school gonna start I can just yeah I can tell by shapeshifter by about size purple swag you know from where I was at for anyone down in an online when I come back out here at someone because a whole the witness reports the newspaper reports the radio coverage we know that something came down in nineteen was taken away on a truck I believe that there are people that have either correct information on this case or have knowledge of the event and I believe it is very possible that there is physical evidence out there good fr Paul have been something other than a new york did a meteorite Lance in Mechanicsburg words meteorites are me yours the his ear rocks from space we actually recover on servers your mostly rights come from ask we also have some meteorites that com from the pirate March plaster of March impacts rocks go into space and just like the bugs on the windshield drive down the highway those rocks also hit the earth and some of them survived in our recovery house unions we also have meteorites from the moon same story video rights are coming to Earth all the time uniform space stuff we ask for me about a hundred thousand tons per year of fine trio of rocks the size of my hands the size of a basketball size car are much rarer they brought the special boxes and they took it down toward the impact area for the questionnaires what were they could put on those boxes in the mid sixties there was a heightened awareness above the potential of the media rights could carry alien life forms of in these rock star fractures in our cracks are crevices and the possibility exists microbial life as we know it could live inside iraq and transported to another planet can survive that journey as a result partly this kind of sensitivity the rocks from the moon bought back by the power much we 're actually quarantined for a period of time this is called planetary protection of falling meteorites can 't account for the objects varying speed or Radic trajectory those local people who saw the object to sam sad it did not come down on a high rate of speed but it came down relatively slowly cosmic velocities orbital glossy round the Sun that an object passed it brings with it when it enters the earth 's atmosphere is huge between 36 and 72,000 climbers media large forced your of course hand we 've never observed I 'm enemy red people say about me right here I go straight up and down you know it don 't turn didn 't seem right was radio-controlled someone who 's been coleman to do that if the object wasn 't a meteorite what did the military Hall above the kicks for words now I don 't think there is a meteorite we felt that carried have been as much secrecy here when I woke up the next morning military David me my brother we want our investing what is that me your fascination me you know good speak to us Mike range after fiery object crashes for Air Force cleaves witnesses saw a me here flying across the skies and report nothing was found in the area I was one in a while the military be coming out there was something important that happen that same evening across town a large covered object secretly removed from the words I could swear on my life was I just know that they talk something out the next morning John Hayes and his brother make their way down to the crash site with seen something on the other side we just can 't figure out what the heck it was so we won our bestie we walk down through its because everybody 's pretty much cleared out my name do you think my system you know fax Fuego how third-party trees the trees were all broke off was a they burn areas Woods 's are how of rate there and were walking through error and it was probably a good for $ 500 fee the evidence suggested that there was a pattern of tree damage down there it was not a situation where the whole force was damaged by some kinda a storm something they were isolated trees that in a trajectory that made sense foreign object that was coming down and fit the descriptions what the witnesses Sep what is that stern there was a clearing right there that it was all fresh better and it wasn 't the same China argue no has wood ducks Parker this year was over lighter killing this could not have been a meteorite because a meteorite lease a huge crater big hole in the ground it wasn 't something that came crashing down from the sky it really confirms what witnesses said the something coming down gradually and only hitting certain trees and not others not making huge hole in the ground it parents think you did no the trust thing out of here and the phone the whole left with the stir I thing where was is they just want to cover up whatever can evidence showed there was anything taken ok cute official im sure if you were here we live on a farm over there going on homie was a former know we live here you know we 're down here all he said me get out words because there 's a chance you know there like radiation where could the radiation come from in fifties and the sixties there was work on developing nuclear rockets and nuclear base propulsion system for aircraft and does propulsion systems released a lot of hair by radiation into the oven happen whether that ever got in for money to research activity I kinda doubt it there could be something with the pain the the vehicle carries that resulted in radiation being left over in some areas concededly if you were carrying a nuclear weapon if that weapon have been damage you know that could have some radiation it would hang around for a while and a measurable but that 's not a common thing that somebody might encounter a serious radiation for ref helps to explain the secrecy surrounding the operation project moon dust was Air Force intelligence operations scattered around the country during the time the text burger then december 1965 was retrieval teams very secretive that would go out and collect space debris and anything that was identified that fell from the sky and they were much more secretive than nasa was we don 't know if there are any man just officers their own of it 's possible they were I think what happen is maybe a piece broke off whatever day how about it there and they was down there looking to make sure there was nothing else there somebody say well here 's proof you know gtalk something and I think that 's what it was all about in the days that followed news about the sighting quickly fades reporters apparently took at face value of when the government came out and said the people sing just a bright new york and I was accepted by the editors and they went on to the next door but local witnesses standby what they saw and worse a small group of local people who 've believe that Doc there were certain nothing happened that night that nothing was going on that there was no military there got the point but there was name-calling and people refused to make an upper stories people who was friends for years even families World Cup talked about it there was big call the Flyers this thing never happened and we got the sense well disc with Doc until you love I steps forward to challenge the Air Force statement year the fiscal sanity happen lot of people don 't know what I am there was a avail of heading over gonna blow up for so many gonna come out a little a series of unexplained events surrounding a mysterious crash in the woods near pittsburgh Pennsylvania shines a spotlight on the small rural community sheer number of witnesses to this event expert was phenomenal there were many people that saw two different stages some sodomy here 's a thought being carried off by the army trust put official sources denied military and nasa presence and maintain nothing in the area even though teams have many in anti-radiation suits are seen combing the woods government never commanding said this ever happen stayed in one publicized they were trying to your whole subject I think the confusion was the fact that nobody really knew for sure what people would say no so president bill you love speaks out to set the record straight year these people saying that may happen I know that act as a rack as the NADPH after disappeared I think it well I 'm going up there see where it was before he joined onlookers on koon 's lane bill follows the object into the wall this he was getting dark so I grabbed a flashlight went down in a routine knocked on a tough dreams that you can see there no and I have seen this down in with their neighbors Stephen this this matter just just think what makes himself it was done in nearby say tutsi deepen at least two feet hitler in ages just glad is ready and ASI those big is a Volkswagen in a little bit longer it will birch hear from the nose here to the bay there was no scenes is no realism in Mountain in DNA data at at thing around the back like a ring and there was a graphic grading Rahman in a day just to break that was well did an air weapon it wasn 't you know this market Benson heading over gonna blow up for so many american rather them I could hear he 's very soon way back background in there I think it had better get outta there they like us are hoping to find out what exactly has landed in these words by the time bill joins the crowd overlooking the crash site speculation about the object is running rampant decision there are things going on all these people where they were there is when guises to Green Bay and I come and other in a day against now I kept it to myself I know when I see many English regions on fact is that you 're was something that was on the ground was a physical object and apparently in military came in at night recover the OPT so now we have question what was really going on here what was the object on white fat and the government come forth tell the public what really happened one of the first series was it is good because most 96 the US space command and the russian space agencies have told us that the russian satellite for cosmos 96 came down same morning as the clicks per defend you cosmos 96 was a pro that the russians had created that they were sending to Venus if it was about nine feet life 15 feet with this was from archery have the central at piper riding on it so oh there are points if cosmos 96 that you know a valid and could actually match up to this back in the nineteen sixties you had the whole space race you have a cold war going on at this time and it was very important that we can get our hands on russian technology and they can do the same with our technology the cosmos 96 hand whatever the most advanced soviet technology was at that time and what was important as far as beginning our hands on it if we could was you could figure out how big a missile pressure could create I can understand the government no one other countries to get access to whatever technology they felt they could recover from this amazing thing then just come now the military show some with house and they come in with a flatbed take something they would not do that if it wasn 't me they would do that if it was a secret Air Force for soviet object that crash-landed Inc exper there 's been was speculation that it was related to Daddy fan but in more recent years more day to have surfaced which seems to eliminate the possibility the US space command indicated that cause must 96 and reinforce after work and 3a team in the morning russian satellite came down about fourteen fifteen hours before the object came down Inc expert Pennsylvania this event happen around four forty seven in the afternoon so we know that cosmos 26 did not come Pennsylvania all those hours later if it wasn 't cosmos 96 1 did in the woods that night don 't describe the object like a big metallic sequin shaped object another theory for is eight nazi UFO from and the bell when an eyewitness discovers a glowing bell shaped object deep in the expert words the military 's insistence that nothing was found at the crash site is pushed to further test we have documentation that shows that when it 's convenient when they don 't know what something is they will often just say it 's a meteor just make it go away just give something to the puff after ruling out the possibility the object was the downed russian satellite cosmos 96 residents look to a more radical explanation either had to have been some kinda highly secretive experimental crap some sort gloria was something from somewhere else find extraterrestrial vehicle a program something we began to accumulate a lot of information which began suggest but there was a lot more the store as a madman as big as a Volkswagen in in a day and a half finger on the back like a ring in a wish epic grading to some historians the following object is you really reminiscence to an alleged top-secret not see weapons some people say it hitler in his pursuit through technology that tss was heavily involved in it 's developing flock the bell descriptions up with in Germany who was an acorn shaped object with this hieroglyphic or really type riding on the bell is that the vice that spins in opposite directions you it has red mercury in it and when you compress and spin red mercury it belongs fi scrapping world purpose of the bell was a an object that can really manipulate time space my understanding is keeping its with your readers that yet some paper time machine why what 's important world is if you can manipulate I 'm space you only can actually come pop on another opposing force and then you turn off and is standing right front you to weapons this one was the similarities between the alleged hot seat belt the object Inc expert extends beyond signs she now one of the things that happened was that it came forth tremendous radiation them radiation from the bell solidified this blind in humans in time plants worry is it killed the chlorophyll who 's very dangerous back in the evening in 1965 some people saw or had direct contact with what appeared to be Massa personnel were searching for something there was some talk that maybe radiation was involved with whatever had fallen if the object in the woods was the Nazi Bell how did it end up in cakes bird twenty years after the war there was something called Operation paperclip he was in half if I T United States to get German technology and the Soviet Union did the exact same thing sold another theory for the expert crash he said either the United States or the Soviet Union got their hands on the technology for the clock the bell so what may have crashed in exper was you three US war Soviet program but the bell technology that went wrong and freshman pencil does not see bell is again it 's ok one theory among many there 's no indication I 'm aware that this was an actual working project I still say that the most likely explanation years you to some very secretive very highly advanced space probe or we still could be going with an extraterrestrial spacecraft up globally Bush described also saying these unusual markings on the the back he called the bumper area actually where these markings that he said were more like symbols the letters of could the symbols be a message from an extraterrestrial civilization is certainly possible that somebody out there would be sending SMS with a pro earth to send out a pro and in the probe was a plaque and on this plaque was a picture a man and a woman show with humans look like and then the number love mathematical symbols this was to show who ever recovered yes that they were thinking people there who knew the number system and we 're attempting to communicate with whoever is probe so its entirely possible that if somebody from outer space was wanting to send this message it would include some kind of symbols to let us know that there 's people thinking out there and doing out there and not just sending things with nothing on it will be the point in that of if this was an alien spacecraft of course our government would be very interested in the Learning and Technology what this thing was B word on when the early days at the space program and here if this was an expressed your space craft we want to learn about propulsion systems the type of materials they have so of course I 'll be one of the reasons why they would probably want to talk about of door and long-term people think expert back when this happened and they know what they saw that night in over the experience and these people were hopeful for answers we began to file of Freedom of Information Act request to many different agencies that FAA past a police military I fault different doc for your request for nasa trying to get information on this and known records ever surfaced nasa wrote back and so we have no records pertaining to your request it seems highly unlikely that nasa would have nothing on expert because nasa its John of during that time period was to deal with anything itself face the other thing is that witnesses report having seen nasa officials on C so for those two reasons it 's just impossible 's far as I 'm concerned that they would have absolutely no documentation not even a newspaper article about what happened in Pittsburgh that did despite government stone like Stan Gorton continues to search for answers over the years I 've interviewed hundreds of people who were involved in different aspects to this case I with your stories I 'll follow up in find these people talk to them the expert case was unique because it involved the crash of an object something fell from the sky which we know was carted off in truck which means that physical material still exists somewhere it was our government retrieved they must know something more about it was so low information really forthcoming on your vet and I really began to intensify my investigation in the 1980s December mine 1965 Voting expert was more County Pennsylvania stand courts produces a documentary about the cakes for incident to dry out new information this documentary includes eyewitness and his determination pays off in the summer of nineteen ninety I was contacted by an individual he told me that he is a par the security team they guarded the object they came in from tax per when I arrived in the early morning hours summer and amok porn Air Force Base outside a Columbus Ohio any said they had as the highest security when this flatbed tractor-trailer with the spark plug came into the base they were given a few could your water of anybody approach that area without proper authorization then it continued on to wright-patterson Air Force Base your Dayton Ohio which was the headquarters for the Air Force project Bluebook later that same year building on this information Stan gordon 's investigation turns up a new witness I received a phone call from a fellow his name was myron my own went to the base they were told don 't be looking around it was trying to figure out what was going on the fight inside that doing and he saw something fun scout twenty-five years after a mysterious crash near pittsburgh Pennsylvania local residents remain in the dark as to what fell in the woods and where the object was taken forever impacted by the 1965 incident Stan Gorton produces an investigative documentary the pic expert incident to draw witnesses statement in nineteen ninety a former truck driver from Ohio comes forward for the first time and agrees to tell Stan his story well with the right now I never said a name pain before because uncle sam says they 're wat happend were never laid down and had become a Denmark the effort though the key to wear give me a bollard dance party no 100 ever talk about it be at work for a large supply house in Ohio with time and within a few days after the incident expert a Navy officer came to their supply house in order a very large supply of a special typeof claes engineering brick to be sent wright-patterson Air Force Base we found a page and they took if to the All training Jenner for a walk to they were told to stay with her truck does unload the pounds to your job don 't be looking around you have seen these men point them out as building I so it when he didn 't see anybody around you went to look in the inference that going when I walked in a barren change a very big Parrikar down breakdown over the top with a wide up underneath a burger trying to cover this thing up turn on 1-click root beer it went down said Marrone now it had a belt paper and a week working on it was breaking up a fight hallmark acorn round about $ 14.3 to stop in about 10 to 12 feet wide at the bottom with a collar on that have riding on a car you fifty or they were trying to get him through won the opening of Turkey an object plan on the workbench me so the lighting was some real good but on their work bench it was a white sheet every so you could see me detail by I have no doubt my mind at the body weight on that table head 3a Behringer any Ken McBride motor he said he was threatened and he was called that your number to help on ebay about the story wolf put in jail throw away the keys you were tossed twenty years assault be public knowledge which course that never happened hymie interacting go under a grand jury and come here for a large they brought the special boxes toward the impact the area is it possible that what myron saw could be related to the boxes the oven things quite overwhelming that something fall from the sky but the military came and recover the object to the stadium for the public when it really was I think definitely something came down expert as to what it was weevil eliminated everything except for some tennis American government secrets object they might testing or something extraterrestrial whatever it is you just gave it to their self in a I will go to my grave without knowing anything about it Hills will pay take another blasini I know of they tell me know their the government host people expert in fact the whole country an explanation for what really occurred at night 1965 I believe that there are people that have either correct information on this case or have knowledge of the event and very possible that there is physical evidence out there mainly in the way of photographs that still exist today always 04 there said next phone call that 's going to give you that final information is going to close the case brown of of of of first of back

 Help ! Help ! Please let this be a dream ... Please let this be a dream ... Hi , Todd . Please let this not be a dream . I 'm so horny for you , Todd . So horny it hurts ... I 'm going to rock you like a hurricane . I never want to wake up for as long as I live . Come on , people , keep it coming ! It 's not Mount Everest ! It was the greatest dream I ever had ! Wet dreams are the best . Dude , I didn 't say it was a wet dream . Couldn 't have been that good then . - Were you there ? - I don 't know , was I ? Why would you be in my sex dream ? Maybe I drop by to say hi , or to borrow something . No , it was just me and Jenny . You 're in my dreams all the time . Last week , we were Vikings . Vikings with flying motorcycles . Yeah . That sounds pretty cool . It was totally cool . Best wet dream I 've ever had . Emily ! Let 's go . Maybe Mrs. Dempsey used the Book and it turned her into a sadist . Nah . She 's always been a sadistic witch . Okay , people ! Hit the showers ! I used to feel sorry for her But now she 's just starting to annoy me . I tried to talk to her but it 's even worse up close . Hi . You wanted to see me ? Has the boy led you to the book ? It 's not as easy as it sounds . Um , it 's impossible to get close to him . Because that infernal gang is always hovering around him . Then you must befriend them ! Convince them that you 're on their side . Here 's the thing , your evilness . Kids today don 't have much trust in authority figures . No one will mistake you for an authority figure , Atticus . Now be gone . Thank you very much . PLOP-PLOP What are you smiling at ? Nothing , I 'm just ... I 'm just happy to see you . You were in Todd 's wet dream . It wasn 't a wet dream ! Oh , hi , kids . Thank you for coming . We didn 't have a choice . Kids , a pair of conjoined twins once said , " Two heads are better than one . " Well , in our case , five heads are better than four . Like a hydra ? What 's a hydra ? A five-headed dragon . What does a dragon have to do with ... NOTHING . But thank you for asking . As a guidance counsellor , which is what I am , it 's my job to offer guidance . Guidance with what ? Finding the Book Of Pure Evil . You told me the book doesn 't exist . I was trying to protect you . And I think I 've done a pretty good job . Yeah ? Well , I think I speak for all of us when I say we 're doing just fine on our own . Really ? And yet week after week the book reappears and wreaks havoc on your lives . You need the perspective and experience of an adult . Which is what I am . Great , I 'm a member of your gang now . No . Yes ! Hydra ! Don 't think of me as an authority figure . Think of me as a member of your gang ! Thank you very very much . I 'm a gang member . Dude , you 're so wrong . Trust me . Jenny ? Did we just join Mr. Murphy 's gang ? No , and we need to watch him . He 's just trying to help . ( Mrs. Dempsey ) Has anyone seen Emily ? Here I am . Emily ... You look so ... Vastly improved . Wow , Emily . AHHHHHHHHHH ! We need to talk to Emily . Hey , guys ... You know that cheerleader , the thin , beautiful one ? As opposed to all the fat , ugly cheerleaders ? Wanda Winterbanks . Word around school is she 's not thin anymore . She 's a five-hundred pound blimp . That 's a bad career move for a cheerleader . It wasn 't her choice , you moron . It has to be the book ! Let 's go ! AHHHHHHH ! It sucks we 're the ones who run towards the screaming . AHHHHHHH ! Maybe it 's not so bad . GRRRRRRRRR ! AHHHHHHHHH ! BANG-BANG-BANG ! Guys , was locking Jenny in there part of the plan ? Cheese ! Guys ... Ugh . So bloated ... Why are you guys all staring at me like that ? Jenny , in a minute you 're probably going to totally freak out . But , just remember it 's not as bad as it looks . Not as bad as it looks ? What are you on drugs ? Hello , gang of kids . How 's it shaking ? WHOA ! WOW ! The book is back , Mr. Murphy . How exciting . When Emily used the book her expel pounds mutated her cellular level and it completely contravenes our ... Whoa , whoa , whoa ... Could you be less talky and more showy ? Um ... You guys , think of the money we could make ! Selling super-fat mice ! You 're telling me this monster fat could turn the whole entire high school into this ... Pretty , pretty lady . I gotta go ! Why is it everytime Todd looks at me he looks so ... Terrified ? It was grade 3 ... Todd and I found a videotape of my parents doing it . And frankly , my parents are fatty boobalatties . Anyway , I thought the pacing was kinda slow but Todd ... Todd was traumatized . Every since then he 's had this crazy fear of my parents . And fat people like ... Fascinating back story , really ... And wonderfully told ... How do we kill this thing ? All I know is if we don 't destroy monster fat , my little buddy 's worst nightmare may become reality . Is it just me , or did it get fat in here ? Beat it . Where 's the book ? Book ? What book ? Don 't play dumb with me , Emily ! Your discarded fat has mutated into monster fat ! A squirt gun ? A squirt gun filled with your toxic fat . She pulls the trigger and you get blown back into your miserable life . I didn 't mean to imply that by being fat it automatically meant you were miserable . Yeah , way to stand your ground , Hannah . It was here yesterday , I swear . Emily . This could be a huge problem . I mean , a huge problem . Not a hug e problem . Like , it could be a massive ... Problem . Ma ... Are you done ? A massive problem , not a massive person . You 're not a problem , or a person ! I mean , you 're a person ... All right . Bring it on , Jenny . CRASH ! Who ordered room service ? AHHHHHHH ! No , no , no , no ! I want THIN , SEXY Jenny ! Thin , sexy Jenny is dead . Long live the heifer . I want you inside me . I 'm inside something ! Oh , Curtis ! Curtis , you gotta help me ! No time , dude ! I just dropped by to borrow something ! Curtis ! Curtis , Vikings are supposed to stick together ! I 'll send you a postcard from Valhalla ! WOOOOOOO ! We 're gonna have some fun , aren 't we ? I don 't know if that 's possible seeing as how my handle just retreated up my hatch . Oh , I 'm not here for sex . I 'm here for dessert . AHHHHHHHH ! Get your muumuu 's ! One size fits all ! Hey , Todd ! Forget the super-fat mice ! These are selling like hotcakes ! HI . Jenny . Hey , Todd . Hey , what 's new ? I know about your fear of fat people . I don 't have a fear of fat people . A lot of my best friends are fat people . Like you . Just admit it , Todd . I disgust you , don 't I ? I 'm the one that disgusts you , remember ? Okay , well , then if that 's not the case ... Then prove it . Kiss me . What ? But ... It 's what you 've always wanted , isn 't it ? Yeah , but ... Okay , then do it . I knew it ! You look like you wanted to eat my face ! I wouldn 't eat your face ! If it was the last face on earth ! We need to ask ourselves what kills fat ? This should do it . Close . Hey , Todd , can you pass me the puke mop ? Dude , why are you hiding in here when you could be riding the wide-load highway out there ? What ? Dude , it 's fat-tastic out there . Man , it 's so sweet . Have you seen ? Yeah , I know , that 's why I 'm in here . I fear the fat . Look , dude ... I 've had it all , all right ? Skinny chicks , tall chicks , mini chicks , chicks with sticks . All right , half machine half chick . BUT , when I want to grease my piece I go obese . But , they 're fat . Look , Todd , you 're not getting the big picture . Skinny chicks are only about skinny chicks . But , fat chicks ? Fat chicks are about you . Jimmy ! Jenny 's fat too . Look , the Jenny you want is still in there . She 's probably screaming in terror , but ... She 's still in there , dude . I 'm ready for that kiss ! You want a kiss , so here I am ! I 'm going to kiss every inch of you . Even if it takes all week ! Todd ! You 're creeping me out . You 're not creeping me out ! Not anymore ! I don 't care if you 're a fat chick , a skinny chick ... A chick with a stick ... What I 'm trying to say is that you 're Jenny . And that 's all that matters to me . PLOP-PLOP-PLOP AHHHHHHHHHH ! Sweet mother of Satan . Nice . You 're right , Jenny . I did unleash a monster . That 's why it 's called The Book Of Pure Evil ! You stupid , skinny twig . I have to make things right . Poor girl . She sacrificed herself to save the school . I 'll never forget you , Emily . Todd ! Forget Emily ! Oh , great ! Now monster fat is boiling hot monster fat ! Than ks , Emily ! CRASH ! â™ª Curtis , I think we 're screwed ! If I get screwed , dude , I want it to be with you . I got it ! Todd catch ! Throw the pill into monster fat 's mouth ! It doesn 't have a mouth ! But , it has an hatch ! I 'll distract it ! Hey , monster fat ! Hey , he knows his name ! AHHHHHHHH ! STOMP Hannah , I don 't know what you did , but thank you . Okay ... Todd , that was pretty heroic . And , um , what you said earlier ... It really meant a lot to me . Dude . Dude , what did you say ? Dude , I have no idea . I was so terrified , I could have said anything . At least you finally conquered your fear of fat people . No , I didn 't . I 'm even more traumatized . At least your arm doesn 't smell like hatch . That 's how it went down . You 're funny . I gotta pee . Pee away , I 'll be right here .

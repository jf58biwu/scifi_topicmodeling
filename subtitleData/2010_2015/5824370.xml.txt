 Well ? - You 're having a laugh . - How do you mean ? Can 't you see what 's wrong ? No , I can 't see what 's wrong . Not pretty enough ? Not in black ! - And ? - Bloody hell , Simon ! It 's yellow and black , that 's what 's wrong . And ? What are our colours ? You got those shirts , I didn 't ask for anything . So now , you don 't like our shirts . They 're just a bit ... They could be more discreet . More discreet ? My arse ! Who are we ? The Bowling Killers , we have to be seen . But you know what ? I won 't play with a black and yellow ball . Why not ? What country do you live in ? Yellow and black . Does this ring no bells ? They are the colours of Flanders , and I am not Flemish ! - The colours of Flanders ? Tony ! - Absolutely ! You , get out of here ! Move back ! Move back , I said ! You 've got no choice , they 're the only balls I brought . Damn it , enough is enough ! First of all , they started painting signposts in yellow and black . Now , the taxis are yellow and black . Whatever next , fucking hell ? ! They 're walking all over us . Where do you think you 're going ? Tony , what exactly do you have against the Flemish ? What have they done to you ? What about you , always defending them ? - Are you Flemish or something ? - Would you have an issue with it ? I don 't believe it , you 're Flemish ? We 're not all called Bartje , or Floris , or Swart ! - But you live in the Marolles . - So ? So you 're from Brussels , mate . Tony , isn 't Brussels in the Flanders , then ? What ? What , what , what ? Brussels , in the Flanders ? Tony , you 're such a fool ! What are you laughing about ? Some things you just don 't laugh about . I very nearly blew your brains out . - Because I was Flemish ? - Yes . No . Er ... What about you , are you Flemish ? No , I 'm a Parisian . But I love your shirts . What an arsehole ! The bloody prick had it coming . Not so clever , now . - Simon ! - What ? I think he 's still alive . The filthy pig ! Must have at least six bullets in his nut . Still have something to say , Camembert ? Have you ? You still have things to say ? Yes ... Not so easy , with a 9mm in your gob . Stop playing , we 're late . No , wait , er ... . What 's the difference between chicory and endive ? What ? Articulate ! Can 't hear you . What ? Sorry , mate , wrong answer . You know what ? I don 't think you 'll ever know , will you ? Fucking hell ! Bloody hell , fuck ! The wanker 's got it all over me ! At point-blank range ... These are crap guns . Crap guns ? Excuse me . 9mm , Browning , Airsoft FN . Made in Wallonia gear , well done ! It 's not true ... It 's not down to the shooters . It 's not down to the shooters ! Look , his face is completely smashed in ! It 's like chickens . You chop their head off , they carry on running . - Nerves . - That 's it , nerves . What ? You think it 's down to the shooters ? You really do ? Tell you what , I have a better idea . - Fuck , Tony , not my bowling ball ! - Out of my way ! You 're a pain , Tony , it 's gone inside the holes . Bloody prick ! - It 's all over the place . - Had a better idea ? You can 't tell what 's what . Shut it ! Find this fucking head , what 's left of it . Must be well and truly dead , this time . He was a tough nut . What ? Simon ! Simon ! Come and have a look . Do you think we got him ? Not half , mate . And yet , he 's less empty-headed than any Frenchman I 've ever seen .

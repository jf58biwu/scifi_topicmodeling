 Previously on Alphas ... I have this thing where I can 't remember anything that happened , like , more than a month ago . It 's got to be lonely . You said that you would bring my dad around to our way of thinking . Do you understand everything I 'm risking for this ? Someone close to us is working with Parish . Cameron , is that one of Dani 's paintings ? Yeah , she just finished it . You haven 't seen it before ? Yes , I have . This is what we came here for , the ultimate rush . Hold this . Put it under your tongue . It gets hot , then you 'll feel it moving through your body . Just look at your hands . - You 'll know when it kicks in . - This is insane . That 's why it 's so awesome . It 's not gonna hurt , right ? No . All right , who 's first ? Let 's go , let 's do it ! Dive out from the 21st floor ! Oh ! That was awesome ! That was amazing ! Oh , my God . Are we doing it again ? Hey , Doc . You want whip cream ? No , not for me , thanks , Nathan . Forgive me for intruding on your family this way , especially at this hour . Not a problem . When you said the investigation into Parish 's inside sources is moving forward , um , what do you mean ? Your abduction was a break for us . Your team tracked you down , they opened a door into Parish 's communications network . Now , it closed pretty fast , but we were able to get a flash clone of his cell log . Every number Parish called , every number that called him . It 's encrypted , tight as hell , but NSA has been working overtime to decode it . They could have something solid on his inside source in three , maybe four days . Four days , and then you 'll be certain ? We 're moving as fast as we can , Doc . Believe me , I want to get this SOB as bad as you do . Daddy , Daddy , we don 't have any tape . This guy tells me last night he 's got a model of the whole solar system that 's due today . You better hurry up . Thanks . I don 't know . Do you help him ? Kids have to learn how to deal with their own problems , right ? Indeed they do . Nathan , I 'd love to have a look at whatever you have , concerning these encrypted phone numbers . I can 't do that . These internal investigations are tight . I can 't even involve my own people . We 'll get him . And he will never see daylight again , because I 'm gonna put him in a room and I 'm gonna throw away the room . This is from the net . Analysts kicked this video over to us . Now , either there are four people with the exact same Alpha ability , or there 's some kind of drug that 's turning people into Alphas . Either way , we need to get to the bottom of this . Right , Bill . I trust you to take the reins on this one . Uh , okay . I can do that . So , you just want me to keep you updated ? Yes , please . - Gar , got you a present . - Ta-da ! Oh , this is a plant . Yep . You 're not supposed to just give someone a plant . This could have bugs in it . You 're welcome . It 's for your man cave . Bill , we need to call the exterminators . Oh , come on , Gary . Kat 's brought some bugs into the office . All right . I just sent you a YouTube link , okay ? Gary ... I need you both to focus . Focus is my middle name . No . You can 't know that for sure . Gary . Gary , I need face grabs off the video , okay ? I ... Check the internet for any matches , okay ? We 're looking for any indications that these people may be Alphas . Hey , what about me ? You can call the exterminator . You bring bugs in here , you take care of that . Douche bag . Hey . Hey . So , I thought of another thing for Friday night . My mom will offer you coffee as soon as you get there . But you must turn her down three times before accepting it . And then once you take it , you have to drink it all , every last sip . Okay . I 'll make sure I come thirsty . Oh , and don 't compliment anything in the house , like a painting or a lamp because they 'll insist that you take it home with you , and then afterwards they 'll complain about it like you 're the boy who stole the lamp . I 'm serious . Well , I know . It 's just ... You 're cute when you 're worried . Does this look like the face of a worried person ? Rachel ... Uh-huh ? You know I 've been in actual combat , right ? Yes . I think I can handle dinner with your parents . Yes . Yeah . Okay ... Okay . Breathe deeper . So he 's not an Iranian lawyer . Your parents will just have to deal . He 's the blondest boy I have ever seen . They 're gonna rip him to shreds . Mwah ! Hello , Daddy ! Dr. Rosen ? Gary , would you close the door , please ? Gary , I need you to handle an assignment for me . I 'm already doing a case for Bill , but I ... I can multi-task . Gary , I ... You can 't speak to anyone about this . If that makes you uncomfortable , I understand . No , I 'm not uncomfortable . Because I 'm a secret agent . Secret is what I do best . Secret 's my middle name . Hey , Tyler ! How are you , pal ? How was the flight ? Bumpy . But they had TVs . There 's someone I want you to meet . This is my friend Dani . Hi , Tyler . I hate it when the flight 's bumpy , too . Come on . Hey , that 's a ... That 's a nice deck . How long you been skating ? A while . Well , I know this cool skate park over on the West Side . You wanna check it out ? Sweet . Dad , can we go ? Of course we can . Busted ! Bill ! She 's a criminal ! She 's busted and I get to cuff her . Hey , get up ! Assume the position . Get up ! You assume the position . Get off me . Bill , bring your cuffs ! Gary , what the hell are you talking about ? Bill , I found the guy from the video . Look . He 's like the ringleader . And this is his Facebook . And that picture . It was taken last year . Okay . So ? So , Bill . Look , there . It 's her . She 's one of them . I kind of look hot with pink highlights . Don 't take no for an answer There 's no telling where we 've been Because people don 't understand , understand , understand People don 't understand People like me Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . This picture 's only showing that she met the guy , all right ? We don 't even know if he 's doing anything wrong . No , he is doing something wrong , Bill . It 's drugs . This is drug-related . It 's called Jump . I found more videos . Okay , so , Kat , I don 't suppose you remember who this guy is ? Do you ? No . But he 's having a party tonight and if Gary can get his address , I can get reacquainted . I mean , maybe score a little Jump . I 'm essential to this case now , right ? No , I 'm not gonna send you in blind , okay ? You don 't even remember if you know the guy or how you left things with him . But you 'll have my six . I 'll be fine . No , Bill 's not gonna have your six . Gary ... He 's my partner . He has my six . You 're not even a real federal agent . Gary . Gary , please . Let me take it from here . Oh , I leave . Yeah . You 're in cahoots . Kat , undercover work is no joke . You don 't have any field training , okay ? And if this Dylan Renfro guy is dangerous ... I kicked your ass . Aren 't you supposed to forget things ? I wrote that one down . Locate Dylan and feel things out . Anything seems off , get the hell out of there . Relax . I watched New York Undercover and Donnie Brasco last night . I 've got this . It 's real life , not a movie , girl . Kat ! I 've been looking everywhere for you . Kickass party . You don 't have a clue who I am , do you ? I 've been pushed off your mental TiVo . Maybe you should refresh my memory . You mind ? Do I look like I mind ? That 's gross . Oh , come on ... Kat , why are you kissing this guy ? I don 't want to see that . We were together . Yeah , I can kind of tell . What the hell , Dylan ? Easy , April . Kat 's an old friend . Hey . I thought we were gonna hang out tonight . Just give us a minute . I get the feeling I 'm getting in the middle of something . Are you guys together ? Are you kidding ? You 're irreplaceable . Oh ! Whoa ... Um , what are they doing ? Having a good time . Damn . Whoa . That 's not a fun party , Bill . Come on ! Uh ! Oh ! Not even a scratch . I 'll have what he 's having . You mean this ? What exactly does this stuff do , anyway ? Come on , I 'll show you . Kat , where are you going ? Kat , you 're going out of range , okay ? I can 't hear you . Gary , follow her on the com . Yeah , yeah . Follow her signal . In the alleyway . We should just leave her . She 's useless . Watch your step . Come on . Can I open them now ? Please ? No , no . A couple more steps . Now . I was hoping you 'd come back so we could do this together . Come on ! You were always crazy brave , right ? I know you forget stuff , but that doesn 't change who you really are . Trust me , Kitty Kat . Kat ! You all right ? That was incredible . No . We gotta go . We gotta go . So , my mom 's gonna keep on offering you food no matter how full you are , and you have to keep on eating it . All right , good tip . Rachel ... Yeah . You speak Farsi . Six years in the Middle East , you 're bound to pick up a couple things . Hey , I 'm complicated . You don 't peel back an onion like this in a couple of weeks . John , you should have told me that . I wanted it to be a surprise . There 's rules , Kat . And rule number one , you don 't dive off a frigging roof . That doesn 't sound like a real rule . Everything 's a joke to you , isn 't it ? Kat , where you going ? I should never have let you go undercover . Why , because I did so well ? Look , there 's a weird-ass drug out on the street and I got a sample of it . Plus , I found out what my favorite color is . You have a sample of it ? It 's green . Thanks for asking . Where 's the sample , Kat ? Right in here . Who 's Donnie Brasco now , bitch ? I made that . I made that with the label maker . We don 't have any top secret stickers . We needed some , so I ... I made 200 . This is what Cley got off Parish 's phone . The NSA 's still working on it , but I cracked it . You didn 't even ask me to , but I cracked it anyway . Well , what does it mean ? It means that I took initiative . No , I know , Gary . Thank you , but no , the numbers . Oh , yeah . You were right . It 's telephone numbers . It 's a very complicated system , Dr. Rosen . It 's even harder to crack than Anna 's code . But I think it must have been made by a super-computer or an Alpha ... Gary , I want you to write down any of these numbers in the New York area that are still active , all right ? Yeah . You saw that thing with the can , right ? You mean when he threw it in the garbage ? Yes , he is quite the little environmentalist . No . Off the wall , into the recycling bin and he was barely even looking . Cam , don 't . I mean , what if he is ? Does it matter ? Yes , it matters . Okay , but , maybe I can help him to understand it , so he doesn 't have to feel like such a freak . I think I should ask your dad to run some tests on him . No , no , no . Listen . My dad ran a few tests on me . It basically ruined my life . This is your ruined life , uh , you , me and ice cream ? No . This is pretty frigging perfect . I love you , you know that ? Hey . Me , too . Dad ? Are we playing video games ? Yeah , pal , hang on . Get ready to get your butt kicked . Yeah , okay . All right . Here we go ... Oh , wow . What ? The compound in Kat 's blood . It reshaped the tissue at the molecular level , creating a short-term form of chitinous , which ... All right ... It made a protective shield around the body , like Kevlar skin . So , Jump makes you indestructible ? Maybe not . One of the kids in the video , Tony Dolan . He was found dead a day after he jumped . Let 's get an autopsy on that , please ? I 've already got it . But it doesn 't mean I actually understand it . Tony died of cardiac fibrosis . The hardening didn 't stop at his skin . It solidified his heart . Yeah , there were eight cases of cardiac fibrosis in the metropolitan area . That 's in the last three weeks . So , Jump can make you indestructible , but it can also kill you . Kat , we need to get you checked out . We 've got to get this drug off the streets . Dad ? Hi , Danielle . What 's wrong ? Is ... Is Mom okay ? Everything 's fine , as far as I know . I just wanted to see you . It 's been awhile . Um ... Come on up . Sorry , it 's the same as always . Hmm . Well , these are different . Yeah . Uh , it 's not done yet . Uh , they 're nice . They 're very nice . Oh , my goodness , you still have this one after all these years . Yeah , I still like the way the hands came out . Yeah , Mr. Tzodee 's class , seventh grade , right ? Yeah . Oh , you hated him . I think you said it was his bad breath . Yeah . Oh , I really did tell you everything back then , didn 't I ? Well , you still can , Dani . Yeah ? Sure . Well , there is , um ... There 's one thing . Cameron . Right . I mean , this is me we 're talking about . I just keep wondering how I 'm gonna screw it up . It 's inevitable , right ? Dani , nothing is inevitable . Not in this life , anyway . Yeah . Yeah , I 'm starting to believe that , too . Right . You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just , uh ... Just ... Oh , I 'd love a cup of tea . Yeah . Uh , yeah , of course . Yes . Make yourself at home . Still no sugar , right ? Uh , right . Well ... Oh , yes . Lapsang Souchong road tar tea . I remember . Morning . Good morning . I know that look , Lee . But don 't worry , I 'm all over this . I got the NSA to triple their manpower on the investigation . You came by my house to light a fire under my ass , and I heard you , loud and clear . Thanks for your diligence . By the way , Nathan , how did it turn out with your son 's solar system project ? I did Neptune and Saturn and I had to hear about 300 Uranus jokes . Your kid needs your help , what 're you gonna do ? Hey , so tonight 's the night , huh ? John versus the Pirzads . Should be on pay-per-view . He speaks Farsi . Well , great . He 'll knock it out of the park . Yeah . I canceled dinner . I thought this was what you wanted . It is ... I mean , it was . All right , spill . What if my parents actually like him . Then what ? Then you have a hot boyfriend . That 's what people call a real relationship . Not that it 's a topic I know much about at the moment . What if I 'm not ready ? The last time I had a real boyfriend was over three years ago . Three years , no sex ? I can 't . With him , I had to get so drunk I couldn 't feel anything . That was three years ago . And John isn 't that guy . Yeah . But I 'm still me . And I 'm a total freak . No , Rachel , you 're not . Think of everything you 've done since then . Think of everything you do here every day . You 're strong and you 're capable . We 're all freaks . That 's my favorite . Chocolate chili and rum raisin . Really ? You 're messing with me . Seriously ? Where 's the trust ? Oh , that 's really good . It 's disgusting . But , you love it . I 'm starting to think I 'm really weird . But so frigging cute . So , what are we doing tonight ? Wanna get more Jump ? I can get as much as I want . I 've got the New York franchise . You deal it ? Let 's just say I know where to get it . I have something . It 's yours . You gave it to me the last time I saw you . This is mine ? This is mine . The first day we met , you were hustling money doing that knife trick from Aliens . Just trust me . You know , the one where you stab really quickly in between your fingers really fast ? Hmm . I thought you were a badass . You thought I was handsome . We were both right . Who 's J. D ? I have no idea . Before my time . I really missed you , Kat . You can 't arrest him . Kat , this is rule number two in field work , okay ? Whatever I say is what goes . Now , we 're gonna arrest him , okay ? We 're gonna lean on him and then he gives up the source . That 's the way it works , Kat . Yeah , but I can get him to tell me who 's making the stuff . I know I can . Kat , you got out of him what you could , okay ? Now , in an hour , I will have an arrest warrant . Now , you did your job . Let me do mine . Thank you . Nice one , pal . Hey , listen . I want you to hit this next one right down the third base line , okay ? Come on , pal , you 're not even trying . I suck , okay ? I don 't want to hit balls anymore . I just ... I just want to go home . Okay , look , we 'll go home . We 'll play video games , all right ? Whatever you want to do . No , I want to go home . My home . Aw , Tyler ... Hey . That 's for an official government vehicle . You 're not allowed to take that . And you 're gonna go and help a drug dealer . You 're not allowed to do that , either . Gary , Gary , look ... I care about this guy . It 's like you care about Bill and if he was in trouble you 'd help him , right ? Yeah , I 'd help him . Yeah , I 'd get his six . 'Cause he 's my partner . But we 're federal agents . You 're just a civilian . Look , Gary . Gary , you 're right . Yeah . I know I 'm right . Look , I need your help . I 'm not authorized to do this on my own . Only a real federal agent can check out an official government vehicle . What do you say ? Huh ? I can 't be ... Yeah , yeah . But I 'm driving . Okay , fine . Can you drive ? Yeah , of course . I passed the test online . I got a perfect score . But I 'm better if I don 't drive on roads , where there are no other cars or people . Just cause they don 't always obey the rules and I could mow people down . Okay . How about on the way back ? Yeah , okay . You wanted to see me ? Hi , Nina . Are you okay ? I need a favor , Nina . Sure . You 've always been there for me . How long would it take you to get a passport under a false name ? I could walk into a Federal building and come out with one today . Dani ? Tyler , I 'm sorry , okay ? Whatever I did , I 'm sorry . Whatever , Dad . I just wanna go home . Come on ... Hey . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , what happened ? I took him to the park to hit a few balls . Okay , Dani ? I had to know . No , Cam you didn 't . Hey , Ty . Can you come out here for a minute ? I don 't want to talk to him . Okay , well , you don 't have to talk to him . You can just talk to me . I don 't want to talk to you , either . I don 't even know you . That 's fair enough . How about no talking ? Promise . Tyler , have you heard about Alphas ? Dani ! I guess . Well , I am one . Give me your hand . Cameron , this is how you made Tyler feel today . Tyler , this is how your dad feels about you . Oh , pal , I 'm so sorry . Dad . I thought that you were disappointed in me . But this feels like ... I don 't know what to call it . It 's just how I feel , pal . It 's love , Tyler . Parish has manipulated her . She 's hooked on his ideology . And Cley is on the verge of catching her , Nina . I ... I just have to get her away from him . Away where ? Anywhere where Cley or Parish can never find her , ever . Now , I have some money set aside ... A recovering addict in a strange place ? With no support system and money to ... She 'll be dead in three months . They 'll send her to Binghamton , Nina . You know they will . Well , I suppose I 'm as much at fault as she is . I 've made so many mistakes . And Dani 's made her own . You can 't keep blaming a screwed up family life forever . You taught me that , remember ? Maybe the best thing you can do is just let Cley do his job . No . No , no , no , no , no . You know how Cley handles things . Anything could happen . She could be dead on the street . Nina , she 's my daughter . Dylan ? Dylan ! You gotta get out of here , right now . Where 're we going ? Look , not we . You . Look , I 'm working with the government , sort of . Look , a tac team is gonna bust down your door and arrest you . You gotta go . I trusted you . And I 'm here to make it right . We don 't have much time . Okay , okay . Just let me grab some stuff . Dylan ? What the hell ? April ! April ! Oh , my God . You 're the source . He 's mine . I 'm his Alpha now . No , we 're getting out of here . We are leaving . No ... Come on . We 're gonna get you out of here . But I want to be with him . He 's using you . He 's going to kill you . She 'll be fine , Kitty Kat . She 's my golden goose . I 'll take care of her , just like I took care of you . Oh ! Oh ! You 're such a boy scout . You 're always getting pissed off about something . And I always find you after you forget . We 'll do this again . We always do . A couple of months from now , you 'll be back in my bed . Kat ! Kat ! Oh ! Kat , come on . Get up . Get up . You weren 't answering your ear bud , so I came for you . I 've got your six . Oh , thanks , Gary . He 's getting away . I called the police but they 're not here yet . Oh , no ! Don 't do that ! Don 't do drugs ! Come on . Kat , that 's drugs . Don 't do drugs ! Bill said no drugs , Kat . Come on , kick in . Come on . Screw it . Oh ! Oh ! Reconsider , oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Never touch me again . Well , uh , have a good flight . See you , babe . Yeah . Come on . Hey , hey . Easy , tiger . Excuse . Easy . I didn 't have anything with him . I was just a piece of Alpha ass . Well , the good thing is you won 't even remember in a couple of weeks , right ? Yeah , that 's the problem . I 'm the perfect mark . Who knows what the hell he had me learn to make him a few bucks ? Well , according to him , he could never get you to do anything too crazy . Just pick a couple pockets or re-wire some alarms . You beat that out of him ? No . I told him that I 'd give you another shot at him . Thanks . For a second , I thought that thing actually meant something . Probably wasn 't even mine . It 's yours now . Why don 't you let that be a memento of your first time undercover ? All right ? Oh , no , no , no . Um ... Come on . Come on , Kat . No , no , no , no . You shouldn 't do that . That 's inappropriate . You don 't squeeze other agents . Good thing I 'm not a real agent then , huh ? Speaking of which , I can no longer send an untrained and undisciplined civilian into the field . Quantico . It 's the FBI academy . Now , normally this program takes about two years to complete . I pulled some strings and I think you can tackle it in about two weeks . Oh , thank you ! Oh , thank you , thank you , thank you ! Uh ... I hear a yes . Is that a yes ? Oh , you , too , Gary ! Oh , no . No . Don 't do that to me . No , I don 't like that . You 're squeezing my six . Come on , grow up . Dad . What ... What are you doing here ? He isn 't coming , Dani . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Parish , he 's not coming . I sent the message . You think you know everything . No . No , I don 't . You don 't know him . You don 't know me . Well , I know enough right now to know that if you keep ... I was on the street when he found me . I was nothing . I was screwing guys for a bag of dope . Dad . $ 10 . Hey , that 's ... That 's who I am . I 'm you father , Dani . That 's why I am here . I want to help you . I don 't need your help . I didn 't do this to hurt you . He said he would bring us together . That 's never going to happen . Please , Dani , don 't run . Don 't ... What did you do ? I just need you to be safe . Dani , I need to see your hands . Dani , show me your hands . John , the guns aren 't necessary . Dr. Rosen , I 've got this . Back off ! Dani , I have to take you into custody now . I want you to put your hands on your head . I want you to lay face down . What in the hell is wrong with you ? Cameron ... You turned her in ! Please understand . If I 'd had any other option , I would have exercised it . She 's your kid ! You 're supposed to protect her . God ! You were supposed to protect her . I just really feel like I should have seen it . None of us did . I mean , not even Rosen . He must be heartbroken . No , hearts don 't really break . They can stop and they can leak . But it can 't really break . It just ... It gets tired . It gives up after awhile . Dani , I know how difficult this must be for you . No . No , it 's a relief . Huh ? Dad , can you do something for me ? Of course . Tell them to put me in Building Seven . Put a chip in my head . Oh , God , Dani ... Please , Dad . Oh , my God , no ... I just want to forget . I want to disappear . No . You 're not gonna do that . Dani , that 's not going to happen . This ... This isn 't the end , Dani . It 's ... There 's an opportunity here . Yes , yes . There is a way out . I don 't want a way out . Will you please listen ? Please ? Please , Dani . Please ?

 Previously on Warehouse 13 ... Mrs. Frederic has a connection to the Warehouse that even I don 't fully understand . This is Benedict Valda . He 's one of the Regents . Paris , 1892 . That 's where I 'd arranged for my daughter , Christina , to spend the summer with cousins . The men who came to rob my cousins ' home were expecting an empty house . I imagine losing a child is the worst pain a person can go through . [ Imitating trumpet playing fanfare ] Your breakfast is served , milady . A banana ? That 's what you made me for breakfast ? Well , it 's actually half a banana , 'cause I could only find one in the kitchen , so we are going to split it . You know , if we were back at my place , I would have made you chilaquiles for breakfast ... In bed . Oh , mi Amor . [ Kissing sounds ] You know how I love your chilaquiles . [ Laughs ] And your bed . Maybe ... Maybe it could be our bed . Well , you know , Artie 's really strict about certain things . You know , he likes to have all his Agents living under one roof , you know , just in case- - there 's an irs emergency ? Exactly . You get it . Sure . I gotta get back to work anyway . Okay . Mmm ! Oh , no , you di 'n't ! Hey , get back here ! Don 't . Hah . Hey . [ Wolf whistle ] [ Purrs ] So what do you think ? About you moving in with Kelly ? Well , yeah . I mean , is it even kosher , you know , Warehouse-wise ? Right . I forgot who I was asking . What is that supposed to mean ? She 's a tech nerd , she 's 150 , and you 're ... Myka . Not exactly relationship success stories . Hey , I just got out of a serious relationship . You didn 't " get out . " He had to change his identity and move to a different state . By order of the Justice Department ! Point taken . I know a thing or two about the opposite sex . Many of my lovers were men . We 're gonna follow up on that at a later date , but , for now , can we bring the focus back round to moi ? Okay , Pete , you just have to ask yourself one question . I know . " Do I enjoy being yelled at in espanol ? " Do you love her ? Yeah . I-I think so . I don 't know . Okay , you 're out to restaurant and you order dessert . The waitress cuts it in half , one side is a little bit bigger than the other . Which half do you give her ? The bigger half , of course , 'cause otherwise- - dude , you 're screwed . You love her . What ? No ! Shut- - you 're in love . Oh . Hi , Mrs. F. Yeah . Well , apparently , based on a dessert , I guess . I don 't know . Me and the ladies were just , uh ... Uh , me and the ladies were just you know , talking about a personal thing that I have . Not that you would ever , pfft , you know . So , if it 's cool , I 'd just like to keep , you know , my personal stuff ... Personal . Nothing personal , I mean , you know , to you . But , uh ... Can I go now ? One , Agent Lattimer . One what ? Uh , " singular sensation " ? " Is the loneliest number " ? You are allowed to reveal the true nature of our work to one person . So the question is not whether you should live with Dr. Hernandez , but , rather , is she your one ? Man , it is good to be out of that desert and back amongst the living , huh ? You know what ? I might start a harem . How many girls are there in a harem ? Uh ... Three . Hold up , I finally got a signal . Dude , no phone calls . Chill out , I 'm just texting a pic back to my sister . Yeah , well , no one 's supposed to know that we 're here . She 's eight . Who 's she gonna tell ? John , you know the deal . Don 't screw this up for us just before we- - [ coughing ] You okay , bro ? [ Coughing ] Yeah , just ... Suddenly got real thirsty . You look kinda weird , man . Terry ? [ Coughing and gasping ] Dude , what 's wrong ? Dry ! Dry ! [ Coughing ] [ Gasping ] Somebody help us ! Oh , my God . Rod ? We have to do something ! [ Coughing ] [ Gasping ] [ Loud vibration ] Mrs. F. , oh , my God . Are you okay ? [ Women screaming ] Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Hey , guys ! I need help in here ! [ Muttering ] Mooht pooh khesfet . Mooht pooh khesfet . Mrs. Frederic ? What happened ? One minute we were just talking and then- - mooht pooh khesfet . Mooht pooh khesfet . Mooht pooh khesfet . Mooht pooh khesfet . ♪ Warehouse 13 2x11 ♪ Buried Original Air Date on September 14 , 2010 I do not speak gibberish , Agent Lattimer . Okay , well , not so much gibberish as ... Creepy spooky blah blah . No , she 's right . It wasn 't gibberish . It was one phrase that you repeated over and over . Mooht pooh khesfet . It sounds middle eastern in origin , maybe Aramaic or an old form of Hebrew . It 's demotic , the tongue of ancient Egypt . Dead languages are a hobby . So what does it mean ? Well , I 'm not sure . It 's been a while . According to the translation program I get ... " The penalty is death . " What ? What 'd you set it on , " extra scary " ? To the best of my knowledge , I do not speak demotic , so what artifacts do we have from Egypt ? Already on it . Maybe it was dementia ... That caused me to say that . We 'll just keep going through the manifest till we find the artifact- - Holy synchronicity , Batman . We just got a ping from Egypt . What is it ? Nothing good . Thanks so much for talking to us about your son , Mrs. Tilson . We 're very sorry to have to ask you these questions . We know how difficult this must be . So the body they found , they 're sure then that it was my John ? I 'm afraid so , ma 'am . See , this doesn 't make any sense . John couldn 't have been in Egypt . John and his friends , they were working at an archaeological dig in Peru . Peru ? Yes . He e-mailed me from there last week . That 's why this is insane . So he didn 't say anything about going to Egypt ? No . Oh , God . I should call Terry and Rod 's parents . Maybe they ... [ Crying ] What happened to our children ? Ma 'am , we promise you , we 'll find out . Hello . You 're John 's little sister , aren 't you ? That 's a very lovely photo , isn 't it ? They look very happy . May I ? Oh , he 's very handsome , isn 't he ? And who is that lovely little girl standing next to him ? Gabrielle , but everyone calls me Gabby . Hello , Gabby . Pleased to meet you . My name 's Helena . I 've got a little girl , you know , about your age . Does she talk like you do ? She does . May I have a look at your computer , please ? [ Computer beeps ] That 's your brother there , isn 't it ? Myka . John 's little sister had the picture , but she didn 't know where he was . Why he suddenly left an archeological dig in Peru to go to Egypt is still a mystery . He sent her this photo . It can 't be , can it ? Don 't make me ask . That would explain a great deal . Claudia , that image , print it out right now . Return with your team immediately . Okay , but what do I tell- - we have to confirm this . I 'm this close to asking . The ancient archives . Go . Yeah , bring the print . I hate myself for doing this . What are the ancient archives ? [ Loud vibration ] Photo ? Artie , what does it mean ? The hieroglyphics in this photo match the markings right here , and it translate as " an oasis between sand and Sea . " What does that mean ? It means that someone has found the lost Warehouse . Someone 's found Warehouse 2 ? How do you lose a Warehouse ? It was always believed to be somewhere near Alexandria . Back when the Romans were conquering Egypt in 30 B.C.- - 31 . They had- - they had very little time to shut down Warehouse 2 and transfer the artifacts , so the Agents of the time buried it . Over time , it was lost to the ages . I don 't buy that our three young Indiana Joneses just stumbled into it for a school project . Neither do I. It is rather unlikely . I think they must have broken the seal on the door , and that activated ... A defense mechanism ... And that 's what caused them later them to desiccate . Which is when Warehouse 2 woke up . Woke up ? You guys talk about it like it 's alive . Surely you know by now , Agent Lattimer , the Warehouse is more organic than your average structure . Warehouse 2 is back online . So it would appear . I still don 't understand why it 's affecting you . When Warehouse 2 woke up , it began to look for its caretaker , but its caretaker had been dead for 2,000 years , so it found the caretaker to the current Warehouse . And that 's you ? You 're the caretaker ? Yes . Each Warehouse has a unique bond with the caretaker , and now that bond is being shared between two Warehouses . That was never supposed to happen . Two networks , one server . My mind cannot take the level of data being , as Ms. Donovan would put it , downloaded . Eventually , it will overload . And by overload , you mean ... There is another difficulty . As Warehouse 2 continues to eclipse my bond , Warehouse 13 will begin to ... To die . So we need to find Warehouse 2 and shut it down . I 'll call the Regents . They will send an expert to meet you in Egypt , who will help you with Warehouse 2 . All right , don 't worry , Mrs. F. We got this . Agent Lattimer , this is unlike anything you 've ever faced . So ... Like always then . They said he 'd be wearing a Panama hat . That guy 's got " Regent " written all over him . That or " mug me , " one of the two . That would be a mistake . The man who tried to pick my pocket would soon wish he hadn 't . Mr. Valda , you 're the expert on Warehouse 2 ? I am . And if Agent Lattimer here can refrain from trying to kill me , we may even survive this . How did anyone ever find this desolate place ? Somehow those kids did . Looks like they planned on coming back here . Well , they didn 't plan on dying . John 's sister , Gabby . Your Christina was about the same age . Yes , she was . Where on earth did they get this ? Maybe they thought they were going to get rich . Instead , they got a deadly faceful of hematite and natron . Basically , they were mummified alive . But that 's nothing compared to the challenges that await us within . In Warehouse 2 mythology , one phrase shows up over and over : " Mind , body , soul . " So what is that , a code ? When the security system was activated , several traps came into play to ward off intruders . Only fully trained Agents of the time knew their secrets and how to navigate them safely . So how does " mind , body , soul " help us ? That is for us to discover together . Once at the center , we shut it down with this : One of the only things to survive the burial of Warehouse 2 . Then once more into the breach , dear friends . I 'll be right there . I gotta make a call . What ? I checked . This is what fashionable british archaeologists are wearing nowadays . No , it 's what American filmmakers think fashionable british archaeologists are wearing nowadays . Oh , really ? Well , it is ever so comfy . [ Recording ] Hi , this Dr. Hernandez . Please leave me a message . [ Beep ] Hey , Kelly . Hey , it 's , um ... It 's me , Pete . I 'm sorry to call so late there , but I 'm about to go into a ... Meeting , and--and , uh ... You know , it 's going to be a tough meeting . You know , lots of ... Bad meeting stuff , you know ? So just , uh ... Just-just in case , uh , that- - I wanted to say that ... I 've been thinking about you and I living together , and , um ... And I think that- - [ Beeps ] Automated voice : Your time is up . Good-bye . That 's what I 'm afraid of . [ Machine ticking ] All right . Oh , my God , this looks like some kind of torture device . It 's a neural assessor . It will monitor my brain waves and track the degree to which I 'll being affected . Yeah , her wave discharges have dropped considerably , and that indicates an increase in the effect of the focal epileptiform activity , and that means that- - we 've got until this moon thingy scooches over to this doodad ? Yeah , when the moon eclipses , that 'll mean her brain has reached its capa- - just keep an eye on the readout , let me know if there are any changes . Artie , changes ! Changes ! Male voice : Mooht pooh khesfet . Artie , we 're at the entrance . Valda 's deactivating the booby trap on the hatch . I 've neutralized the hematite . The kids never made it past the entrance . That 's it . Warehouse 2 sensed an intruder . It 's having an effect on Mrs. Frederic . Valda says we 're good to go . We 're heading in . Okay , go in , but be careful and hurry . [ Whispering ] Mrs. Frederic doesn 't have much time . This totally blows the King Tut exhibit away . What are we looking at ? I 'm not sure . [ Door scraping ] That 's not good . [ Ceiling thuds ] And you were right . Help me pry this open ! Nope . It 's not gonna be that easy . Okay , uh , " mind , body , soul . " What if it 's three clues , instead of one ? Three different traps , each one its own security device that needs to be deactivated . Right , and this- - this is the first one : Mind . Yeah , as in , " I mind if this place flattens us like pancakes . " Okay , what if we used one of these posts to brace the ceiling ? No , no , Myka , Myka , Myka ! Wait ! Pancakes ! Do you ever think about anything other than- - no . This is like a game I used to play at the pancake palace ! This is the only hole without a post , right ? A game of wits , a test of the mind . A kid 's puzzle . Pete , how does it work ? Okay , uh , we have to jump each post like checkers , but in a certain pattern till there 's only one post left . No , if this is wrong- - I won free banana walnut pancakes every Sunday for a year . They had to discontinue the contest . Myka , get the post I just jumped . Okay . He knows his pancakes . [ Both straining ] Okay . Okay . Valda . We gotta take these out in order before the ceiling hits them . Oh ! Okay . Okay . Okay , come on . I 'm just chasing down this money trail- - moot-kher-tou . Moot-kher-tou . Claudia , can you find out what that means ? Moot-kher-tou . Artie . She 's saying , " one must die . " Moot-kher-tou . Pete ! [ straining ] Unh ! Ooh , ooh , God ! Ahh ! Okay , last one . Come on ! God ! God ! Pete , hurry ! It 's getting faster ! Hurry ! Pete ? [ Ceiling thuds ] Nicely done . Bravo . That 's right , dig it . Who solved the test of the mind ? Pete did ! Wocka ! Only because you order off the children 's menu . Somebody 's buying me pancakes for a year ! Perhaps we 're going to get through this mission after all . [ Blades whirring ] Wow . This couldn 't get any worse . Thanks for that . Okay , there has to be some way to shut this off . Well , maybe , uh ... Maybe these hieroglyphs are some kind of instructions . Um , let 's see ... Charlie Brown t-shirt , uh , hairy eyeball , foot . It 's tahtib , " the art of the way . " Isn 't that the ancient egyptian martial art ? Wah ! Like karate ? This is the body puzzle . So maybe this is " the way . " [ Breathing deeply ] Foom ! Hoo ! Hyah ! Hee ! [ Shouting , blades whirring ] Aah ! Aah ! Yii ! Ahh . Okay , okay ! That is definitely not " the way " ! That is impossible ! [ Door unlocks ] Artie . Vanessa . Oh , I am so glad that you 're here . Well , glad is hardly the word under the circumstances . Oh , I know , I know . It 's good to see you , too . [ humming ] I mean , it 's not good to see you , but we 're gonna get through this . Ahem . Oh , yes . Claudia , this is Dr. Calder . Dr. Cal- - oh , Vanessa . Oh . Well , I 've heard a lot about you . A lot . [ Whispers ] Nice . Can we focus , please , on more important things ? Yes , of course . We 'll talk later . Will hell be freezing over ? Vanessa ? Oh . There you go . Maybe we should try and rise above the situation . I think I know the way . I like her " the way " better . Grappler , don 't leave home without it . " One must die . " Shall we ? Okay . The water bearer holds the key . What does that mean ? Just take this . Remember what I said . Wait a minute . What , aren 't you coming ? I 'm right behind you . Go ! Go on , hurry ! All right , all right , all right . Quickly , Pete ! [ Pete grunts ] Valda ! Hold on ! I can make it back there ! No ! If you come back , we both die ! Moot-kher-tou . " One must die . " This is as it must be . Now go ! We 're not just gonna leave you here ! I won 't give you the choice . No ! Why didn 't he let us help him ? I don 't know . He read something on the wall back there . It looked like it scared him . Can we even do this without him ? We have to . Look , we should tell Artie . Let me call him . It 's not working ! Well , maybe we 're too far underground . It would seem we go this way next . We have to keep going , Pete . Yeah . Okay . [ Sighs ] Dr. Calder . Good . You know why I 'm here ? I do . Artie ? Your neural functions are dropping . [ Mrs. Frederic gasps ] Are you in pain ? Yes . [ Metal creaking ] Okay , come here . Claudia , something is happening to the team in Egypt . Use my Farnsworth , try to get a hold of them . Her connection with Warehouse 2 is getting stronger . I can 't get a hold of them . I think maybe their Farnsworths are out of range . I 've got to check on something . I 'll be back . Wennen ... Wennen yefedu eem . What is that ? What 's she saying ? " Where once there were four ... Now there are three . " Ioo senooi er tenem . [ Keyboard clicking ] Come on , come on . " And two will lose their way . " Little girl : Mummy ? Kelly : Pete ? Kelly ? Artie : Myka . Mummy ? Christina ? Myka . What 's happening ? Welcome back . A large americano with an extra shot and room . My favorite . Christina ? Is that really you ? It 's you . It 's me , right here . No . I mean , it 's you . You 're the one . You . Here 's your next case . It 's a tough one . Lots of details , exactly the kind of thing at which you excel . I can 't wait for you to tell me all about it . I 've got you . I 've got you , love . And I 'll never let you go . I 'm a secret service Agent , working at a top-secret facility , hunting down mysterious artifacts all around the world , and you are the only one that I 've ever told . It 's okay . I 'll always be right here for you , and I can keep your secret because I love you . [ Floor rumbling ] [ Laughing ] Now , it seems like just a series of random accidents there in Great Falls , Virginia . Artie , what 's that doing there ? What ? There 's nothing there . That exit sign , it 's new . Very observant . That 's my girl . Once you and Pete get to Great Falls ... [ Crumbling ] How do you do ? How do you do ? [ giggles ] Such a pretty little girl . Mummy ? Artie , why are you being so nice ? I 'm always nice . ... Ish . You don 't give compliments , and certainly not with a smile . I 'm getting more in touch with my feelings . What 's that exit sign doing there ? Well , come over here and I 'll show you . Come on . Myka , come right over here . Come on . Come here . Come on . Come over here . No , this isn 't real . This isn 't ... Real . This isn 't real ! [ Floor crashing ] Pete ! H.G. ! [ Panting ] Pete ! Wake up ! Wake up ! Pete ? Wait . H.G. ! H.G. ! Wake up ! Mummy . Christina ! Aah ! What did you do ? It 's the soul test , okay ? It tricked us . It took us to our happiest place and made us feel secure so we wouldn 't notice- - it 's the Medusa . The Medusa ! Thanks . It 's Kelly . What are you talking about ? She 's the one . Good . Yeah . We should keep moving . Helena ? Helena , are you all right ? [ Crying ] My baby . My little baby . I 'm so sorry . It was so real . Mrs. Frederic is dying . If we don 't do this , Warehouse 13 could die with her . That 's real , and we have a chance to save her . Let 's get this done . Okay . We both know you must be prepared to do what you 've go to do . I know . Doesn 't mean I have to like it . What do you have to do ? What is that ? Claudia , we all want Pete and Myka to succeed in Egypt . And they will . And if they don 't and if Mrs. Frederic dies while she 's still the caretaker , this Warehouse will begin to close itself down . If the Warehouse is to survive , then a new caretaker must be in place before I die , and a new connection must be made at that moment . A new connection ... With who ? Me . [ Sighs ] Okay . Uh ... Flattering . But , um , why-why me ? All of us have our purpose . I 'm really not ready for that . You will be when the time comes . It 's all part of the design . Won 't I just wind up getting my brain shredded , too ? Mm-mmm . No . When the connection with Warehouse 2 is broken , Dr. Calder can take precautions . Pete and Myka could still shut down Warehouse 2 . Yes , but there 's not much time left . [ Gasps ] Senooi hem er tenem . [ Laughs ] The tests are over . We made it . This must be the ancient Artie 's office . That 's incredible . What is that ? It 's the only thing here that 's on . Yeah , and not in a happy way . It 's probably safe to assume that 's what 's affecting Mrs. Frederic . Wait . Ah ha ha . Totally awesome . My God . Magnificent . [ Orb humming ] Okay , so how do we turn this orb off ? Well , this is the control center . Let 's turn it upside down . I should probably go down to the Warehouse and see if there 's a way to switch it off down there . Myka , look at that . [ Blows ] Okay , it 's a bunch of holes . Maybe what Valda gave me fits into one of them . Like a key . That 's what he said , a key . Come on , Mrs. F. , hang on . We have to wait for Artie . He 'll know what- - Claudia , we can 't wait . It 's time . Wennen . Wennen yefedu eem . Ioo senooi er tenem . Ferydice . [ Mrs. Frederic whispering demotic phrases ] It 's just another puzzle , Pete . I 'm sure we can figure it out . Wait a minute . Wait a minute . There 's--there 's something about this . It looks ... Maybe it 's like the mind test . We put the key in a series of holes in a specific sequence . No , no . It 's- - it 's something about the ... Pattern . It 's ... That 's it ! Myka , I know it . I need your wrist , please . Now , Claudia . That 's the night sky . I used to study it with my dad . Those are stars look , there 's the Big Dipper ! That 's Pisces , and that 's Aquarius . The water bearer . And the water bearer holds the key ! [ Grunts ] [ Mrs. Frederic whispering demotic phrases ] Come on , Pete , you 're almost there . Just--just one more inch . Aah ! Oh ! [ Machines powering down ] [ Both laughing ] Ha ! You did it ! Wait ! The connection 's broken . They must have shut down Warehouse 2 . Yay ! Victory lap ! Uhh ! See ? I knew they 'd come through . How do you feel ? Well , I won 't be running a marathon any time soon . No , certainly not in those heels . Myka . Myka . Thank you , dad . That 's two I got , you know . I know . You solved one , and I solved two . I know . It 's not a contest . You 're right . You 're right . It 's not a contest . But if it were ... I 'd be winning . Myka ! You have to see this ! Dr. Calder . Yeah ? I 'm really sorry . I didn 't mean to come off like a brat back there . I know you were just trying to protect the Warehouse . Oh , honey , it 's all right . Listen , you are very young . You 're entering a world that is vastly more mysterious than any of us can understand . I just want you to know , though , that you will be ready . Remember that . [ Door beeps ] Mm , tell Artie I said good-bye . Maybe you should be lying down . Maybe you should brief me on what was happening while I was ill . Ah . You found my little project . I did . Tell me . Okay , um ... Well , something 's been eating at me since we got the ping . You know , those guys who were mummy-tized , they 're college kids . They 're not rich , but they went to Egypt , they staged this huge dig . That had to cost a chunk of change . You think someone hired them to find and enter Warehouse 2 . Someone with long arms and deep pockets . You know , I find the source , we find the bad guy . Enterprising . I 'm impressed , Ms. Donovan . And your research came up with something . I got a ping ? Yes , you got a ping . [ Beeping and whirring ] That can 't be right . The money that was used to hire those students , it 's from ... It 's from Warehouse 13 . Where 's Arthur ? I don 't know . He said he 'd be right back , but that was hours ago . H.G. , guess who just saved the day , again ! Actually , it was pretty amazing , with the night sky . Yeah , yeah , there were all these holes , and they were actually stars ! Stars , and- - Helena ? I do hope you can forgive me . For what ? This .

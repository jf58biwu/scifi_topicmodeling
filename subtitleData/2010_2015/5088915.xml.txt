 Previously on Continuum ... They have tattoos . It 's a series of dots between their fingers . Who are " they " ? You call them " freelancers " . - What do they want ? - What everyone wants . Power . Control . I 'll be running this squad under a separate mandate , a separate budget , and a new set of rules . It 's time for the gloves to come off . Waking up in a fishery , it 's 1992 . So do you know what they do ? They stick me in a nuthouse . Yes , yes of course . Kagame wants you to go . What if you could save tens of thousands of people , even if it meant killing one person ? I 'm not gonna be whatever it is you say , ok ? ! I 'll ... I 'll be something different ! I promise ! People can change , I can change ! You are too dangerous . Please , just don 't kill me , ok ? Please , I beg of you ! Please ! Thank you ! Thank you ! What if this is it ? My pointing a gun at his head , this whole experience ... what if I 'm the one that creates the monster ? Welcome home , Theseus . You say these people are my followers . Gather them . I have something to say . We 're locked down . How did you get in ? Even in our final days , we 're not without allies . You 're preparing for eternity ? I 'm not a believer myself , but we all have been fighting for freedoms , including spiritual ones . I 've done things . Made choices contrary to my beliefs . That 's what soldiers do . Death may not be waiting for us . I thought you said you weren 't a believer . Not in a higher power , but in a message . Our message . Kagame . The teachings of Theseus . - What are you saying ? - Simply this , don 't fear death . Each ending is merely a new beginning . 2077 . My time . My city . My family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . The time travel portal sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home , but I can 't be sure what I will return to if history is changed . Their plan ... To corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on , is me . S02 Ep10 = Second Wave = I 've got Arc searching for all members of Liber8 . What about Gardner ? He 's gone radio silent . Well , if Gardner left his house in the last 24 hours we would have something . Cell phone ping , facial recognition , bank use ... I 've had nothing on him in the last week . Arc isn 't some magic trick . It relies on real time data , which means things need to be happening in real time , not yesterday and not tomorrow . What ? Julian needs to be added to the watch list . Ok , fine . Added . Alec , what happened in the woods is done . Julian 's moving on . Past Liber8 , past his own actions . And , if he keeps his word , so will I. You really went somewhere . I 'm not sure I know who you are . - I didn 't hurt him . - You were ready to . But I didn 't . That 's who I am . Well , thank god Carlos could get through to you , ' cause I couldn 't . You did . In your own way . - What 's that ? - It 's Garza . What ? I 've been trying to find a location on her ever since she grabbed me . Arc just got a facial recog hit on her 90 seconds ago . - Where ? - I 'm getting the coordinates now . Carlos . I 'm ... I 'm sensing reluctance . You 're as sharp as your suit . Then let me put you at ease . You can start by telling me how this is all going to blow up in my face , because you 're involved Kellog , so I know it will . Looking into Escher is in our mutual interest . If I 'm right about his intentions ... I 'm more concerned about your intentions . - Hey , you ok buddy ? - Yeah ... yeah , fine . Escher . You were saying ? You have resources I don 't . You need to think about your future , Lucas . I do but why should I put them at your disposal ? Apartment 24 , 93.5 percent probability . Thanks , Alec . I had him cross-reference every tenant in the building to draw a probability of association with Liber8 or the Syndicate . He came up with a 93.5 percent probability for the person in apartment 24 . 93.5 percent probability . That 's the best he can do ? ERT units are on their way , we should wait . Look , we can either stand around and talk about catching Garza , or actually do it . By the time ERT gets here , she 'll be on the wind . - I thought you came alone ? - I did . Police ! Open up , Garza ! No , wait , watch this . Gotcha . - She looks calm . - That 'll change . I feel like it 's my birthday . You wanna unwrap your present ? Go get a coffee . You take it . You have history , use it . And this one is off the record . No cameras , no recordings . - Get me what I need . - Understood . - You 're ok with this ? - Taking down Liber8 ? That 's why I 'm here . That 's not what I 'm talking about . Dillon just gave you a free pass to use any tactic necessary . And I intend to use it . He doesn 't have the authority to do that ! - Nobody does ! - Dillon gets it . - Maybe you need to . - Kiera . This isn 't 2077 , alright ? There are rules and consequences . You wanted to shoot Julian ! I can only imagine what you would justify doing to Garza . Why leave it up to your imagination when you can see it for yourself ? Travis 's location , his objectives , his personnel . I want all of it . Try a little harder , this feels more like foreplay . You 're sexy when you 're worked up . Take off these cuffs , we can both enjoy this . Fine . Play it smug . But I will break you . Count on it . How 's Alec ? Not relevant . Really ? Must piss you off that I know him better than you , both versions , young and old , his secrets , his plans ... his interests . New rules . Alec Sadler 's office , 2077 . Explain . He told me about the message he put in your head about your purpose . What is my purpose ? Tell me ! Make me ! Make me , come on ! Kiera ! Ease up ! - What 're you doing ? ! - What 're you doing ? ! It 's the military chip they put in her head , it makes her loco , you better watch that . Maybe you need to wake up , start thinking for yourself ? This kind of tactic gets us nowhere . Or maybe it got me exactly what I wanted . She 's all yours . - Alec , are you there ? - I wouldn 't miss this ! I think Garza just accidentally gave me a way to locate Travis . - How ? - She said my CMR was military . - Is it ? - No . But she thinks it is because that 's what she knows from Travis . He must have had a military CMR implanted when he was in the Super Soldier program . Now , I 'm guessing they deactivated it when he went to prison , but ... Maybe we can remotely activate it the same way we triggered Elena 's ? Exactly . And then we can find his location ! Can you do that ? Let 's give it a shot . Ok , I 've got a general area . Gas Town . Alright , keep working on the signal . I need an exact location . You ok ? You were supposed to locate Garza . Why haven 't you ? Normally they would be holding her downtown at one of the precincts . But the cops ain 't acting like cops anymore . They 're acting like a private army . Find out what precinct has added security . - That 's where she 'll be . - I 'll look into it personally . Make sure you do . 'Cause I take failure personally . Your plans for world domination still on track ? Yep . What are they , anyhow ? Like , does this have anything to do with it ? This is Arc . It 's a way to take the entire internet and distill it into one single page of information . It 's the ultimate window into real time data at light speed . So I can download music really fast ? All the music ever recorded at your fingertips , instantly . No download required . Now replace the word " music " with anything your heart desires . I think I just got it . You 're brilliant . And my heart desires you . Which reminds me ... What 's this ? You said you lost your phone , so I got you a new one . Thank you . Alec ? Are you there ? I gotta go to school , anyhow . Good thing I 'm not the jealous type . Ok , here goes nothing . Get up ! Kiera , I think I 've got him ! I got a general location , I 'm sending you the coordinates now . Any way we can make that more precise ? I 'm working on it . Ok , you 're within 50 metres , he should be up ahead ! Hold on , there 's something I need to check first . The corporation destroying this low-income housing is the same one that makes you pay for the privilege of holding your money , then gambles it and your pensions , on bad real estate deals . If we let the corporations have their way here it 's only a matter of time ... Kiera , they 're the bodysnatchers ! - Yeah , freelancers . - What 're you gonna do ? ! Lure them into a trap and find out who they are . People , not profits ! People , not profits ! My god , Alec , what 's happening ? ! In order to narrow down Travis 's CMR signal , I had to send out a pulse . - What 's that ? - I didn 't say anything . - Who was that ? Alec ? - Protector . Protector ! - Holy shit ! - Who is that ? How did this turn into a conference call ? Somehow your CMR just linked to Travis 's . Shut it down , Alec , now ! Shut it down ! That was Travis Verta in my head . Yeah , I guess activating his CMR did more than just locate him . Whatever you do , don 't reconnect it ! If we were linked , he may now be able to track me ! Or worse , track you ! Shit ! Shit , shit ! Kiera ? People , not profits ! People , not profits ! People , not profits ! Friends ! Friends ! Terrorist ! Terrorist ! Terrorist ! Yes , from some points of view , you could say I 'm a terrorist . I instill fear , terror into those that want me silenced , the ones that want all of you silenced ! So if fighting for you , the ones that can 't fight for themselves , makes me a terrorist , then I guess that 's exactly what I am . But same with George Washington and Nelson Mandella , Geronimo ! Any kid who picks up a stone and throws it at a tank advancing on his village ! But friends , hear me . The true terrorists here are the financial institutions and corporations who seem to be above the law that is there to protect us as citizens ! Form a line ! Do not let these men through ! Rebel ! Rebel ! Rebel ! Rebel , rebel , rebel ... Alec ? Alec ? ! Rebel , rebel , rebel ... Get the suit , he 's a cop , he 's a cop , get him ! This way ! Rebel , rebel , rebel ... So Kiera told me that you let Alec Sadler go . Just makes me think . Maybe you 're not beyond saving . I know what Sadler means to you . - To the rest of Liber8 . - She told you ? Yeah . I know all about you , how you got here . Blow your mind ? So , you bangin ' her ? - Are you bangin ' Travis ? - Every chance . Well , then I 'm guessing he 's probably gonna want to find you . He 's gonna put surveillance on all the precincts , eventually he 's gonna figure out that this is the one you 're being held at , and then we 'll be ready for him . So you have to decide . Do you want Travis to live ? Because he 's " shoot to kill " in this brave , new world of ours . There 's nothing brave about a police state . One day you 'll realize that . By then , it 'll be too late . I gave him the phone that you prepared for me . Good work . What else ? Arc . It 's the master key to all digital information , real time access to any database . - Secure , private . It doesn 't matter . - Interesting . Now , did you see anything else in the lab ? Technology that at first glance might appear difficult to comprehend ? What is it , Emily ? I need you to pull me out . I have done everything you 've asked . I 've provided protection . I 've kept tabs on everything he 's doing , it 's just that ... It 's just that ... you have feelings for him ? Yes . But that 's not the point . He 's a good man , and I think he 's doing the right thing , - and I don 't believe that we 're ... - Emily ? I don 't pay you to think . You don 't pay me to be a zombie , either ! Fair enough . I 'm just saying I assumed you wanted someone who was 100 percent committed in this situation . - He loves you . - I believe he does . And you love him . So who could be more committed ? You 'll stay on the contract . Now , what I need you to do is break up his routine . Get him out of the lab tonight . Take him for a dinner out . - Why ? - Because I asked you to . I made reservations , it 's on me . Is this about getting him out of his lab ? - Are you gonna do something ? - Emily , I am always doing something . Right now , what I 'm doing is protecting Alec . And , by extension , you . Alec ? Alec , are you there ? Hey . I saw what you did out there . We could use more people around here with your passion . - Thanks . - Here , have some water . I 'm Rebecca . You ? - I 'm - Kiera ... Her name is Kiera . Everybody ! Meet one of my father 's killers . So . Changed your mind about letting me live ? I didn 't know you were here . You know , in the woods there was a moment where you were ready to kill me . I could see it in your eyes , why ? - Doesn 't matter . - It matters to me . You 're alive . That 's all you need to know . What about the future ? You said this all had something to do with Kagame ... you said you knew what I was going to become . Talked about all the people I would kill , I mean , in the thousands . As if it had already happened . Kagame and Sonya used the exact same point of reference , the future is set , my destiny with it . It 's not set . Other people 's words telling you what to do ? What do you believe ? We need to finish this now . Not in here . Alec ? Anything ? She just wants to talk politics . Every second she stalls , Travis gets further away . Yeah . - Martinez ! - Yeah . You . Garza . You know what to do . You got it . - What ? - This doesn 't feel right . You have a better idea ? That woman in there would kill you without a second thought if given the chance . And you 're worried about a little roughhousing ? No . I 'm worried about where this goes . And frankly sir , I 'm worried about you . Well I appreciate your concern , detective . But I don 't need your worry . What I need is for you to get off that fence you 're sitting on and start doing your job . She 's part of the system that wants to destroy you , and this movement ! You think I don 't know that ? Then you know what needs to be done . She could have killed me in the forest . She didn 't . Don 't lose your nerve just because she did . You want to be a leader ? Then lead . It 's time . We got confirmation on the precinct where they 're holding Garza . She 's at Stadium . What 're you gonna do ? You gonna waltz in there and get her ? If I know Garza , she 's just gonna waltz right out . I 'm worried about our friend . It might undermine his ability to lead effectively if this unusual behaviour was to get around . Make sure that it does . Today , my friends , we took to the streets and let the corporations know that we would not stand for their corruption any longer ! Now , instead of listening to us , they seem to have sent us a message in the form of an assassin . Message received . They say if you live by the sword , you should be prepared to die by it . This is her sword . Are you ready to die by your sword ? You cannot make a man listen with a bullet . No , it takes words . Ideas . Enlightenment comes through education . They can try to take away our liberties , but they cannot destroy our ideas ! - Untie her . - Theseus ! Untie her . Now . You 're free to go . You still think I 'm a monster ? Are you breaking up with me ? What ? No ! Why would I bring you here ? I don 't know , show me a good time in a public place so I don 't cause a scene ? You 're a romantic . And a pessimist , apparently . I have no intention of breaking up with you . Then what are we doing here ? God , you are breaking up with me ! No ! I just wanted to get you away from ... get you to myself . Yeah ? I need to say that there 's something you don 't know about me . I haven 't told you that I ... Emily , it 's ok . I love you , too . Hello , fresh meat . I guess this makes you " bad cop " . If that works for ya . Can I use your phone ? So good ! Excuse me , can we have the cheque when you have a chance ? Your meal has been taken care of . Nobody 's supposed to know we 're here . We should go . If I could just have a moment of your time ... You 're Alec Sadler . - Yeah , and you are ... ? - Escher . - Pleased to meet you . - Emily . Let me just tell you why I picked a dinner , and I 'll leave the two of you alone . - I have a question . - I hope I have the answer . Don 't worry , you do . What do you want , Alec ? What do I want ? You mean what 's my price ? No . How do you want to live ? More importantly , how do you want to be remembered ? I thought you were going to pitch me . Offer me triple what Kellog 's paying me . Well , I could do exactly that if that 's what you want . But I 'm guessing it 's not . I 'm wagering that you see past the transience of wealth , that you are looking for something . Something more fulfilling . A legacy . I think I can help you get it . - But I would have to abandon Kellog . - For a start , yes . - Think about it . - Yeah , I would have to . That would be the smart play , but please don 't take too long . The longer you wait , the more difficult it will be to get what you want . Emily , pleasure to meet you . - Please take care of him . - I will . Excuse the interruption . Have a great evening . That was weird , sorry . It 's fine . - Kiera ? - Yeah . Take care of it . I 'll be ok . - You sure ? - Yeah . Ok . - What was that in there ? - Insurance . - Where is he ? - He got called back to the lab . You don 't want to challenge me , Emily . I don 't know what you mean . I mean , you went along with my introduction back there . Now , how do you think Alec will feel when he finds out that you work for me ? When I ask you for information , I expect you to leave nothing out . I understand . I 'll try harder . Well , I 'll ask you the question again , now that you understand the stakes . What else in that lab might be of interest to me ? Nothing . Get back to work . - Hey , it 's me . - Hey , where the hell have you been ? - I 've been trying to get a hold of you . - It 's kind of a crazy story . Look , I have a location where Julian and his crew are hiding out , I 'm going to text you the information . Ok , I 'll get eyes on it . Gotta go . Gun ! Get back ! Get back ! - Take it easy , Garza . - Get back ! Take it easy . I 'm going into this elevator . If I see a cop when I get out , I shoot , no hesitation . Call downstairs , get the exit sealed ! Mobilize ERT . You , you , you ! Come with me . Carlos ? You haven 't thought this through . We 've hit this building before . I know it inside out . Go , go , go , go ! What does that mean ? It means I gotta do a full reset . It 's like they drained your batteries completely . I 'm going to need to surge you in order to recharge them , so once I turn them back on there 's going to be a burst of power flowing through your CMR . I 'm sorry , but it might hurt a little bit . Great . - This is the main one right here . - On the right , yep . - Alright , what am I looking at ? - It 's the elevator shaft . We 've got units making their way down already . At the base of it is an engineering access tunnel . The same developer built this entire block . The tunnels lead to several adjacent buildings . I gotta get back down there . Let 's get units dispatched to all those buildings . - You ready ? - Ready as I 'll ever be . Here we go . Garza ! Some of this tech is similar to yours , but these other components , I have no idea what they are . They shut my system down too easily . Whatever they have , I need to know how to counter it . They 're from the future , aren 't they ? Like even more future than you . - What do you think they want ? - I don 't know . And not knowing makes me vulnerable . And that 's not my only blind spot . The message you sent to yourself . Did it contain any information that you didn 't tell me ? No , why ? Garza said something about my purpose . Did she say anything about it to you ? Kiera , I wouldn 't hide anything from you , you should know that by now . Yeah , I do . I 'm sorry . To be honest , I would be lost here without you . You wouldn 't be here without me ! I owe you , remember ? No , it 's not that . You 're my friend . And with everything that 's going on , I don 't want to lose sight of that . It 's Carlos . Hey , you 're up awfully late . - You can 't drug away the truth . - You 're not real . - The protector killed you . - You sure about that ? Did you see the body ? Or do you only believe what people tell you ? Leave me alone . Sonya told you Travis was killed . Kellog said he could be trusted . All lies . Your instincts knew , yet you did nothing . What do your instincts tell you now , Lucas ? That I 'm going insane . Or maybe for the first time in your life you 're seeing the truth . Even if what you 're saying is true , what am I supposed to do now ? I 'm not sure . But there 's one who does know . Are you ready to be enlightened , brother ? Hey . Checked out that address for Julian , the place was empty . - What happened here ? - Garza happened . - She killed Martinez . - Carlos , I 'm sorry . - I underestimated her . - We underestimated her . But I think I know how to find Travis , and she will be with him . You don 't understand . Garza didn 't escape . What are you talking about ? Security cameras from the building next door caught her being carried into a sedan by the two you ID 'd as bodysnatchers . Warren and Miller . How do these guys operate ? What do they operate from ? Why are they collecting people like you ? I don 't know . Yeah , well maybe you should find out . Sorry ... You said that you can track Travis ? - I think so . - Good . Maybe we can get to him before they do . I will find you , Garza . Are you there Cameron ? The city can only get smaller , protector . How do you know this will work ? I don 't . No one does . But either way , this life will end and a new life will begin . You 'll either know it , or you won 't . It 's that simple . Thank you , Travis , for giving me something I thought I had lost . Hope ? No , the knowledge that my fight is not over . I am still a soldier . This was here when I arrived . Now I understand what it means . What does it say ? " Your brothers await you in the next life . " Do not seek them , they will find you . " Trust in that . "

 How long are you gonna keep scanning ? ! I 'm going on ahead . You idiot ! Come on ! Are you being dense on purpose ' cause this is a drill ? ! So you 're against bringing Kottos robots into ES.W.A. T ? Obviously . I 'm amazed they let those buckets of bolts on the force to begin with ! You sure they aren 't defective ? The deployment of robotic police is a statistically-proven crime deterrent . with ES.W.A.T. it 's a different story . Their only merit is their thick armor . annoying bullet shields ! though ? I 'd like to know my tenant 's situation ... that 's all . I 'm home ! What 's with the baby ? It 's the fruit of the love between me and Yoshitsune ! What ? ! There 's no way ! my grandpa in the Legislative Bureau asked me to look after him . The Legislative Bureau ? Meaning this baby 's a bioroid too ? Yeah . But what can a baby bioroid possibly be useful for ? 109 . Emergency mission . I 've sent 113 to pick you up . We 're unable to locate a kidnapped girl . A Hekatoncheires may be involved . So you 've been staying at Hitomi 's place ? I have to keep you safe . I have to keep protecting you . Just how long do you have to keep protecting me ? Partners are supposed to be on equal terms . I have to watch your back and keep you safe . It 's always been that way ... Then you can stop now . I 've had enough ... Deunan ... I can 't have someone always shielding me ... I can protect myself now . I want to be on equal terms with you . I 'm not going home until we truly can . It 's my fault ... It 's okay . She 'll turn up safe and sound ... Yes . The police will make every possible effort to find her . this may be a summit-related terrorist act . 45 . Status report . We 've discovered signs of hacking . It appears they checked the hospital records and struck when she came for her regular checkup . Looks like they took her away dressed up as a doctor and nurse . Anything from the vicinity of the scene ? Eyewitnesses saw a gray van drive away shortly after the incident . If we can just ID it using the surveillance footage ... Good . Wrap up your investigation at the hospital and join 02 . Use our jurisdictional authority to set up vehicle checkpoints . all right . Man . Smoking out bad guys all quiet-like isn 't my style at all . we got it . Now what ? Wait at the designated point . I 'll give you further instructions there . You better make this worth our while ... After our business is done . leaving a kid in a parked car like this ... Kottos . I 'll take the van over to the impound lot now . Kottos ... Where are we ? Where 's my mommy and daddy ? I was supposed to be at the hospital ... Adi . I have taken you into my custody . I will now take you to the police station . To the police ? ! But I haven 't done anything wrong ! Please do not worry . We will contact your guardians and have them pick you up . Thank goodness ... okay ? H-Hey ! The van ! Now what ? ! we can forget about our bonus ! She can 't have gone far ! Find her ! You are going the wrong way . The station is in the opposite direction . I wanna go this way . It 's okay ! There 's just somewhere I really want to visit first . It 's just a little side trip . right ? It 's just for a little bit ... You 're really serious ? Okay . Fine . Then I 'll go by myself ! The girl 's name is Adi . She 's a bioroid with severe bronchitis . She 's unprocessed ... she hasn 't had any genetic manipulation or modification . She 's nearly human . Meaning an AI can 't tell if she 's bioroid or human then ? There are dandelions on top of that hill ! I can 't get there by myself . take me there ! Just for a little bit ... Actually ... I 'm not really Mommy and Daddy 's child . I 'm a bioroid . Mommy and Daddy said they really wanted a kid but they couldn 't have one . So they asked the Tartaros Center to make a bioroid kid for them . so I 've always had poor health . I 'm always at home or in the hospital . I 've never played outside before . They said I have to stay away from windy places and stuff . you know ? I want to visit that hill I can see from the hospital ... Kottos ! We 've found the target . Apparently a tow truck driver left her with a Kottos . We 've determined their present location . Take care of the situation before the kidnappers make contact again . Roger ! Tartaros Center Chief . This will provide us with a tentative solution . Tentative " ? they would 've already started negotiations . then she 'd already be dead . There must be some other reason behind this abduction . Some other reason ... There 's one other thing I 'm curious about ... it should be simple to produce bioroids that match personal preferences . Why was this couple so insistent on having her unprocessed ? perhaps things that rise from random chance are seen as precious ? precious ? Say a child is born frail and with poor health because she didn 't undergo genetic processing . some parents might still wish to raise the child because they view this " random chance " as uniqueness . Especially with a couple like them who haven 't been able to bear children ... Wow ... I never knew Olympus was so pretty ... Thanks ! Mr. Kottos ! Pretty ... fly where you want now ... There she is ! Up there ! officer . We 've been looking everywhere . We 're this girl 's primary physicians . they 're not ... She must be frightened and confused . officer . Briareos ! Kottos ! Don 't let ' im get away ! I 'll blow that bastard sky-high ! You ain 't going anywhere ! Even if it means blowing the kid up too ! Kottos ... Damn robot ... Just had to mess things up ! ES.W.A. T ! Throw down your weapons and surrender immediately ! This is your only warning ! Don 't die ! Kottos ! Kottos ! Kottos ! Eat this ! You retract your opposition to Kottos robots in ES.W.A. T ? I saw a side of them during this incident I couldn 't see during training . I see . What happened to that Kottos ? and completely reinitialized its AI . I doubt it 'll ever do anything like that again . Oh ... Adi ? Kottos ... right ? Adi ! I 'm so glad you 're all right ! I thought you had died then ... yeah ! I wanted to give you this if I saw you again ! For you ! Adi ! Kottos !

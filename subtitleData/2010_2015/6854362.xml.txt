 NARRATOR : Previously on Fringe : Whatever they needed from you , they have it . It 's not safe for you here anymore . You have to go home . - You know who you are , don 't you ? - What happens now ? WALTER : She can move between worlds . If we can learn what she already knows ... COL . BROYLES : We can defend ourselves . - What if her new identity doesn 't hold ? - Then she 'll no longer be necessary . COL . BROYLES : What about our Agent Dunham ? Has she made contact ? WALTER : She 's on the Other Side , focused on the task at hand . - Good night . - Good night . ( BUZZING ) MAN ( ON TV ) : He 's dead . PETER : Oh , you gotta be kidding me . Hello ? Walter , is that you ? I can hear you breathing . WOMAN : Is this Peter Bishop ? Yes . I 'M calling from New York . I know this is gonna sound crazy but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes . - Who is this ? - Her name was Olivia . She has a message for you . She 's trapped in the other universe . ( LINE CLICKS ) Who is it ? Apparently I 'm eligible for unprecedented savings . Unprecedented savings at midnight ? Well , it 's never too late for savings . Apparently not . I think you should save their number and call them back when they 're sleeping . - Blocked . - Oh . What you doing ? Just sending an e-mail . At 2 : 15 ? Well , it 's not 2 : 15 in Greece . Thought I 'd catch up with a friend in Corinth . - You got a friend in Corinth ? - Yeah . And like he always says : ( SPEAKING IN GREEK ) What does it mean ? It means , " Be a better man than your father . " His dad 's not great at communicating , so we have that in common . I vowed I 'd stay in touch . Ah . I 'm going back to bed . You coming ? Be right there . Just gonna grab a glass of water . Okay . I failed the test , didn 't I ? What did it mean ? The Greek phrase . It meant exactly what I said it meant . But it was Olivia who said it to me , not some friend . How 'd you figure me out ? Had something to do with that phone call , didn 't it ? How 'd you do it ? How 'd you replace our Olivia ? You were with us when we came back from the Other Side , weren 't you ? You have a lot of questions . I understand . But you can understand that I can 't give you the answers . This from the woman standing in front of me in pajamas who just shared my bed . I guess answers is where you draw the line . It 's not realistic to think that I wouldn 't do what I came here to do . Is this gonna kill me ? Not if you do it right . Five cc 's should be enough . So why are you here ? What was the assignment ? That 's all right . I wouldn 't tell me either . Because if you 're telling the truth and this doesn 't kill me the last thing you want me to have is information . You gonna come after me ? You gonna kill me ? No , I 'm gonna get answers . And if I find out that you did anything to Olivia then I 'm gonna kill you . The effects of the paralysis will wear off in a few hours . ( GASPS ) Fringe s3e08 Entrada WOMAN : Any nausea ? Yeah . Bit of a headache too . On a scale of one to 10 . Tequila hangover . Something like that . Eight weeks and none of us suspected anything . Did she give any indication where she was headed ? - Anything you overlooked ? PETER : Not that I can think of . PARAMEDIC : I 'll get this to the lab , sir . - I 'd like samples sent to my lab as well as quickly as possible . Any luck running that call that came to my cell phone ? All we know is it was made from a Manhattan payphone at 12 : 21 AM . - No way of knowing who placed it . - Odd . It seems Olivia was able to cross over momentarily , but unable to stay here . Well , we gotta get her back . So how do we get Over There , Walter ? Crossing over is out of the question . Not without Olivia 's help . But there may be something I haven 't thought of yet . Peter , you said she administered the paralytic at 2 : 15 AM . Now , what were you doing here at 2 : 15 AM . ? Olivia called our house . She thought she heard someone trying to enter her apartment . Walter , you don 't have to cover for me . Since we came back from Over There Olivia and I became something more than friends . - I see . - It 's perfectly understandable , son . In the ' 70s , I innocently wandered into the wrong home and it was three days before I realized my mistake . And unlike Olivia the woman with whom I was sharing a bed didn 't look like my wife at all . She took the wrong computer . I searched her computer . She caught me . I convinced her it was mine . - What 's on it ? - I don 't know . It was encrypted . BROYLES : Hernandez , I want access to every file on this computer . OWNER : That 's what they do , isn 't it ? They make you wait for them . I 've been waiting for seven years . Your kind isn 't so good at keeping promises . But I guess you 've got it all under control . Agent Dunham hasn 't completed her mission yet . No , but we can 't worry about that now . We need to provide her with an extraction point . Well , sir , last time we swapped an entire steel bridge with you on it . The principle is the same . You simply need to narrow the harmonic field to focus on something smaller . A single person . We 'll use the girl . We 've gotten all we need from her . And obviously they have equivalent mass . Pull your team off what they 're doing . I need a time and a location for Dunham . Alive or dead ? Do you wanna send back their Olivia ? Alive or dead ? Because I feel there are very valuable parts for study . And I would just have to replace their mass . He 's ready for you . Someone helped her get past our patrols , onto this island . Whoever the traitor is , they don 't understand our goals . To save our world from destruction . Our people , our families . I know that you know this as well as I do , Phillip . For the past 20 years , our world has been breaking apart because of what they did . And now with what we 've discovered about how that girl crosses over we 're about to turn the tide . Only one world can survive . And finally we have made strides so that it can be ours . Our Olivia will be returning shortly . Her mission Over There was a success . To her safe return . OLIVIA : No , no , no . Please , no . Please , no . Please , please , please , help me . Let me go . So far , despite his obvious eccentricities , Dr. Bishop has been very helpful . BROYLES : And Peter ? - He 's been helpful too . I like him . So this is how she learned about us . Anything in there about how she communicates with the Other Side ? So far , besides Olivia 's debriefs , just files on all the cases we handled . I 'm a fraud . A failure . Four hours of intense meditation augmented by a precise two-gram dose of Brown Betty and I 've got nothing . There is no way to cross over safely . I 'm afraid I have failed you . I am sorry . And I have failed Olivia . Walter , you haven 't failed us or her . ( DOOR OPENS ) Any news ? So far , our task force has recovered 17 pieces of Walternate 's device . The other Olivia used her clearance to access the aircraft hangar where they 're being stored . She took this . That 's why . Walternate couldn 't find all the machine 's pieces on the Other Side . So he sent her here to retrieve it . BROYLES : But if her mission is complete ... - She may be going home . Not only may Walternate complete this device but if we lose her , we lose our chance to use her to get Olivia back . Dr. Bishop , any thoughts on how she would cross to the Other Side ? No . Nothing . And I have no idea how to bring our Olivia back . It 's all because of that temptress . She tricked my son with her carnal manipulations and he fell right into her vagenda . Vagenda ? Like Mata Hari using her feminine wiles to accomplish her evil ends . And I , too , fell prey . She used my stomach to get through to my heart . Hey , Walter . Didn 't she tell you she brought these back when she went to the Federal Building ? This bakery is in the Bronx . Why would she go there ? - She must know somebody there . - Let me see that address . You want new legs ? There 's one more thing I need you to do for me . So why would she be coming here ? Let 's split up and show her picture around . I 'll take the pastry shop . ( BELLS JINGLE ) - Help you ? PETER : Yeah , I hope so . I 'm looking for a woman who frequents this area . You seen her before ? No , can 't say as I have . - You sure ? - Yeah . Typewriters , huh ? Seems like a high-rent area to be selling something so retro . People come from all over the city . I specialize in stuff that 's hard to find . Yeah , I can see that . Can also see my computer right here . Hey , they promised me new legs . - How does it work ? OWNER : I don 't know . No , really , I don 't . They just come here . It 's a quantum-entangled telegraph . A machine that could communicate between universes . Fascinating . Well , if it works anything like a normal typewriter ... Penn Station in Newark . ( EASY-LISTENING MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO ) Oh , no , no , no . Your money 's no good here , sir . Times are tough . It 's nice to know we have heroes . Thank you . I wanted to come and see you . Thank you for not giving me up . You easily could have . How 's your son ? He 's sleeping through the night again . We owe that to you . I want you to know that I realize that . Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable ? That 's not why you 're here . You 're here to make yourself more comfortable . Maybe . Do you know what they 're gonna do to me ? Why I have these marks on my forehead ? They 're sending me back . They 're gonna swap me for your Olivia . But they 're gonna kill me first . They 're gonna cut out my brain and study it . Please , help me . If you can get me out of here , I can get myself home . I can 't . My world is dying because of what your side is doing to us . - If I help you escape ... - No . Despite what you think , my universe is not at war with yours . This all began because a man came over here to save a boy . And 25 years later , I came back to save that same boy . But if you let me die , then we will strike back and we will fight . But if you let me go both universes can survive . There must be another way and I promise you I will find it . Two floors up . There 's a lab there . If you can get me in there , then I can get myself back home . And if you 're lying ? You 'd say anything right now because your life depends on it . But what if your side has every intention of our destruction ? Am I supposed to just hope you 're telling me the truth ? If you don 't trust me then there is no hope . ( DOOR OPENS ) I 'm sorry . Please . Please . DIANE : So are you gonna tell me ? Or are we gonna keep on pretending that there isn 't something on your mind ? I have a decision to make . Okay . Remember when I joined Fringe Division ? Mm-hm . Two weeks into the job , we had that vortex in the East River . A hundred and sixty-five people swallowed up . Half of them kids . But now we may actually have a chance to start to put our world back together . Only thing is , to do that , we 're gonna have to go to war . A lot of lives would be lost . An unimaginable number . And I don 't know if I could live with that . There may be another option , but it could put everything at risk . Either way , who am I to play God with other peoples ' lives ? Who am I to make that choice ? Twenty years ago , I knew that you were the right man to protect our world . After all these years , I 've never stopped believing that . I think this world has seen as much pain as it can stand . We need to restore hope . Tell your people she 's armed , but she has to be taken alive . She may be the only chance to recover our agent . OFFICER ( OVER RADIO ) : Understood , sir . - Good . I 'll call you when we get close . Dr. Bishop , any thoughts ? Several . Not many of them pleasant , however . BROYLES : I meant , do you have any idea why she 's headed to Penn Station . Do you think she 's trying to cross to the Other Side ? Is there a soft spot ? No , not as far as I know . Peter , we 'll get her . And we 're going to bring Olivia home . Glad you 're feeling so confident . She was strong enough to get us a message . And if there were anyone I would bet on to survive Over There , it would be her . Spin her . What 's her heart rate ? BRANDON : Sixty , resting . Should I give her more sedative ? No . If her heart rate lowers any more , we won 't be able to preserve her organs . Why don 't you go prepare the coolers in the receiving room ? ( SAW WHIRRING ) ( DOOR OPENS ) Excuse me . You 're not allowed to be ... ( SILENCED GUNSHOT ) BROYLES : We don 't have much time . We have to get out of here . Come on , get up . - You came back for me . - Don 't thank me yet . - I have to give you adrenaline . - Oh , no , please , don 't do ... ( SCREAMS ) - Man , that hurt . - I 'm sorry . Don 't be . - The ground floor . What 's there ? - The lab . - They have a deprivation tank . - That 'll help you cross over ? Yeah . It 's something to do with the lack of sensory input . What is it ? I 'm not positive but I think it 's Cortexiphan . What 's that ? Long story . If I 'm right , it 's why they stopped their experiments on me . They found what they needed . It could help your people cross over to my side . They emptied the tank . I can 't cross over . ( ALARM BLARING ) ( ALARM BLARING ) - Come on . We have to go . - No . You 've done enough . If I can get to the other side of the island , I could swim for it . I 've done it before . I 've gotta get to Boston . - What 's in Boston ? - The Secretary has a lab at Harvard like my Walter Bishop on the Other Side . Your Walter has a tank , so you think the Secretary had one too ? They 're genetically identical . They think alike . I can 't think of anything else . They 've changed the harbor patrols . You 'll never make it . But I can get you there . Come on . Hello ? MAN ( OVER PHONE ) : Sir , there 's been an incident at Liberty Island . What kind of incident ? Olivia Dunham is gone . BARISTA : Here you go . Best coffee west of the Passaic . - You want cream and sugar ? - No . You can keep the change . LUKE : Some things are gonna be hard to leave behind . Come on . Time for you to go home . You know , I sometimes dream about it . The Other Side . Sadly , for my kind , coming here is a one-way ticket . I thought your kind didn 't care . Give me your right hand . Palm up . Eight identities in the last five years , but this has been my favorite . I seem to be a big hit with the ladies . You may wanna close your eyes . ( GROANS ) - Have you spotted her ? - No . There are six entrances to the building . We 've got a team on each one of them . Don 't shoot yourself . No gun for me . Good idea . Okay . Turn around . Lift up the back of your shirt . Let 's split up . You three with me . The transfer is scheduled for 4 : 00 . That 's in precisely 23 minutes . Oh , I 'm sorry . I know you 're cleaning , but I really have to ... Dunham . Freeze . ( CROWD SCREAMING ) I got her . She 's in the northwest bathroom . She 's in there with another guy . I want two teams . One from the west and one from the east . Put your guns down or I will shoot her . Put your guns down or I will kill her . Put them down . Oh , my God . Mom . Mom ! - Don 't you make me kill her . - Mom ! What 's your daughter 's name ? Your daughter 's name . What is it ? ( CROWD GASPS ) Mom ! BROYLES : Drop your weapon now ! Take her . Where is she ? Where 's Olivia ? Tell me how we get her back . I don 't know . That wasn 't part of my assignment . Whatever happens to me , I want you to know this started as an assignment ... - ... but it became ... - Something more . That would be so much easier to believe if you weren 't in handcuffs right now . OFFICER : Mr. Bishop . - Yeah ? We found this in the bathroom . No sign of the component she stole . Thank you . So , what do we do now ? Okay , I think that 's it . OFFICER : Move in . Go , go , go . On point . ( CLATTERING NEARBY ) - They 're here . How did they find us ? - Subcutaneous tracker . I 'm too important to lose . Look , I 've seen war . But if what you 're saying is true in the end , I have to believe in hope . Please , make this worth it . Go . ( GUNSHOT ) OFFICER : Colonel Broyles , you are under arrest . Where 's the girl ? Freeze . Don 't move . She 's in the tank . Open it up . ( CLATTERING NEARBY ) Olivia ? Olivia . Oh , God . I want a three-car escort , half-mile buffer zone all the way to Boston . ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) WALTER : Mm . PETER : " Mm , " what ? These look familiar . PETER : Familiar how ? I don 't know yet . ( HIGH-PITCHED RINGING ) E minor . It 's pretty . - That was Astrid . Olivia 's back . - She 's what ? She crossed over into your father 's lab . They 're in an ambulance to Boston General . - Why Boston General ? She okay ? - She had some kind of seizure . - I 'm going to see Olivia . - Peter . - Walter , just stay ... - No . I remember why this is familiar . They 're harmonic rods . Like Belly and I used to use to help objects cross between universes . - This was found in their Olivia 's bag ? - Yes . Broyles ! Broyles , stop . I don 't think you wanna see this . Hey , Liv . Check this out . No more pain . No more burns . I 'm as good as new . It 's like nothing ever happened . Just like nothing ever happened . Ha . ASTRID : Excuse me , agents . Have you seen Broyles ? He 's late to work this morning . Have you tried calling him ? Yes , I tried calling him . At home too . His wife said he did not come home last night and that is very unlike him . I 've never been a big fan of needles . Doctors , needles , hospitals . Make a fist . You know , when you 're a kid and you 're sick , you know , you just ... You come to hate them all . ( GRUNTS ) Go ahead . Try them out . That 's it ? Only one way to find out . ( CHUCKLES ) Thank you . Thank you . Peter . I 'm sorry , Olivia . Don 't apologize . You were the only thing that got me through . If it wasn 't for you , I would never have made it back . You saved my life .

 Tell me where 's Galan . Those people are dying . What are you gonna do ? It 's time for a more direct approach . I know there 's a bigger picture here , and I think I 've earned a right to get a look at it . There 's no bigger picture , only pieces of a puzzle . And what piece was Nicaragua ? It was a virus , a plague that , unleashed today , would make the Black Death of Europe look like chicken pox . Do you think it 's possible to use the heart to resurrect the virus ? And what a pass , a beautiful true ball , from Bravo to Holester to seal the win for the Riot . Yeah ! Unh ! Someone woke up with some moves this morning . Yo , and that pass ? Damn , son . Yo , you 're the one that laid out for that P.K. Nice . Hey , clutch game , Bravo . Thanks , man . If by " clutch " you mean going an entire 15 minutes without getting booked , then , yes , Bravo can claim that prize . Hi , hello there . Tony , could I get a word ? You two know each other ? Yeah , she 's ... Anne Spencer , Bravo 's agent . This stunning creature is your agent and she makes house calls ? I had some news that couldn 't wait , an endorsement offer . For him ? Well , you must be some kind of sorceress . And I might need new representation . Perhaps we should talk . I wouldn 't want to waste your time . At your age , I 'd be lucky to get you on the cover of a pamphlet in a doctor 's office . Ow . Looks , talent , and she 's got claws . Welcome to my future , Anne Spencer . Good game , Bravo . I thought you said we were square for today . You remember I have my sister 's Quinceañera , right ? Attendance is mandatory . I cannot miss that , Annie . I was a debutante . I know the drill . So what 's the pressing news that couldn 't wait ? Is it possible Galan is sick ? I don 't think so . Why ? In processing all the intel Reyna Flores gathered , we found these . - Adaptive wellness . - He ever mention it ? She took multiple photos of him visiting this building over the past two years . She 's been following him for two years ? It 's registered as a compounding pharmacy , but Galan 's financials show biannual payments there in the amount of $ 500,000 . Guess he needs new insurance . Okay , so whatever it is , Galan is funding it . What does that have to do with the virus he helped dig up ? If someone 's gonna weaponize a 2,000-year-old virus , they 're gonna need money , and they 're gonna need a lab . Noah 's gone there to check it out . I 'll let you know what he finds . That 's it ? The world isn 't gonna end today . Go be with your family . Nice game today . Can I help you ? See , you 've got that the wrong way around , 'cause I 'm thinking I can help you . Aaron Harvey , Portson Medical Supplies . You 're probably used to Brooke . She used to cover this area before she got " relocated " to Burbank . I tried to tell my boss , you know , the valley isn 't gonna help her quota like five milligrams of lithium would . Little pharmaceutical humor there . I 'm sorry . We don 't work with outside vendors . We 're not just any vendor . We are the fastest-growing medical apparatus company in North America . Now , if you just give me an idea of your needs ... we don 't have any needs at this time . Come on . Everybody has needs . Maybe there 's somebody else I could talk to , you know , an office manager , a doctor . No ? Well , at least let me leave you some keepsakes . Some pens for you . And they don 't skimp on these key chains . That is real mimetic polyalloy right there ... For you . Oh , clumsy . Please , it 's a gift from Portson . I 'll be on my way . Adaptive wellness . Make him comfortable . Understood . Mr. Harvey . It turns out my office manager may have a use for you after all . This way , please . What is this ? What is this ? What is this ? What is this ? There . It 's perfect , mom . It 's not too much ? See , if I knew what the dress looked like . If I showed you , then it wouldn 't be a surprise . Who ever heard of a surprise Quinceañera dress ? Exactly . Baby , you look beautiful . I just mopped . Relax , madre . Oh , relax , I only have 50 guests coming in an hour . You need a Margarita , take the edge off . 'Cause when dj Ricky drops the needle , all that tension gonna melt . Hey , you made it on time . What a surprise . You look good . Of course I 'm on time . I 'm not gonna be late to this . I just thought , you know , because of the game ... Well , the game 's over , and I 'm here now ... no distractions . And you were amazing ! - Amazing . - Oh , yeah ? We watched when we were getting our pedicures . - Did you see that pass ? - Yes . - Hey . - Hey . - Nice game . - Thank you . Who knew you played so well with others ? Is the food here ? Yeah , it 's outside with the caterer , but you can 't eat a thing until I know the suit fits . Oh , I thought that ... what , is this no good ? I changed the honor court colors again . I just want everyone to look perfect on the dance floor . You got something to say , Morales ? Fall formal , displaced stress fracture , fourth metatarsal ... that 's the last time your brother looked perfect on the dance floor . Don 't listen to her . I 've been taking lessons in my off time . - When do you have off time ? - You 're next . Okay , we 're gonna go change before he pulls something . Oh , God , why did you tell her about the toe ? I know Cristina ... she 's not gonna trust me to lead the dance now . Oh , well , you can redeem yourself later tonight . Okay , so Cristina had a vision . - A vision ? - Mm-hmm . Okay . Oh , man . Wow . Okay . I , for one , can 't wait to see the transformation . You mean now ? Well , you 're really modest for a guy who changes in a locker room in front of 20 other dudes . Just turn around . I won 't peek . Just promise me one thing . What ? If you feel the need to vomit tonight ... Are you still bringing this up ? Just avoid my dress . You do realize that that was 11 years ago , right ? What can I say ? A girl never forgets the first time someone throws up on her Quinceañera dress . In my defense , I didn 't know what Tequila does to a 15-year-old , and you weren 't exactly crying when you had to change out of that thing . That was dress so heavy . All those ruffles , all that tulle . That dress was so big , I couldn 't get close enough to dance with you . Right , blame it on the dress for leaving me without a dance partner that night . Would you zip me up ? I 'm sorry I made a mess of your big day . Well ? All zipped . You know , this color 's not that bad . Mm . Brings out your eyes or whatever . Billie , you needed me ? An alert came through about seven minutes ago . Noah 's phone is offline . Only two ways this happens . Either it 's been destroyed , or the failsafe was activated . But the failsafe only activates if someone 's trying to hack into it . I 've been calling every minute . Show me his last location . - Cool . Thanks . - Of course . Hey , hey . Oh , Cristina should have been out by now . I can 't believe I let her keep that dress a secret . That looks like my Quinceañera dress . Surprise . I had it altered a little bit . Does it look okay ? Cristina . You look so beautiful . Oh , and I found this with the dress . We can put it on the cake table . - Hey , is that dad ? - Yes . We have a little problem , baby . It 's raining ? On my Quinceañera . What are we gonna do ? We 'll move the party inside . Hey , you with the thing , come over here . Pick up the furniture . Roll up the rugs . We need a dance floor for our waltz , baby . Billie , Noah 's not here . I 'm triple-checking your GPS . You 're literally standing in his last known whereabouts . Whoever was here has cleared out . There 's no lab , no virus , nothing . That cannot be good . Hey , man . This is where I ask where the cameras are , right ? Okay , I 'll shut up now so that you can talk ... like , who you are , why am I here , those types of things . Okay , look , whatever you want , take it . I 've got money . You can take my car . I will take the truth . Truth about what ? Man , what is this ? What were you doing there ? All white dudes look alike to you ? That 's not me . Sorry . I mean , there 's a slight resemblance , I guess , but ... What is that ? You sell medical supplies . You know should know an I.V. When you see one . Portson Medical Supplies ... that 's right . My name is Aaron Harvey , and I 'd really like to know what you have in that bag and what you intend to do with it . If you won 't give the truth , then , as I said , I 'll take it . So what is it , truth serum ? Is this a joke ? You 're afraid now . That 's good . It brings out the veins . Okay , I 'll be back . Okay . May I have this dance ? So does this make things right for us ? Well , it 's a decade after the fact , but I guess . Yeah , I had no idea that you were so mad about me not dancing with you that night . Well , it 's not really something you can explain when you 're 15 , you know ? Yeah . It 's funny . I 'm kind of feeling like I 'm 15 now . Well , you 're playing soccer again . Yeah , I think having that back makes me feel like I can have other things back too , like this . - I can feel your ... - I know . Sorry . Looks like you need to get that . It 's just my agent .

 This is what Destiny intented from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive . We are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , this ship came here for a reason ! Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter . For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . Colonel , I 'm curious about the ... Incident with Dr. Rush . I managed to activate the systems on the crashed ship . Aliens showed up . Do not engage . Chloe may be onboard one of those ships . I don 't think they did want to destroy us . What they really want is Destiny . Another nightmare ? Every time I close my eyes . Maybe you should talk to TJ . No , it 's not the dream , it 's ... What ? Look , you 're ... They 're gone , okay ? We got you back , you 're safe now . So , move on ? Get over it , right ? That 's not what I 'm saying . Forget it . I want to help you . No , it 's fine . I just ... I just need to clear my head . Same dream ? Yeah . Me too . What did they do to us ? I don 't remember everything . Yeah , me neither . Maybe that 's a good thing . Everyone thinks we 're safe . They think that they 'll never find us again . We 're not safe , are we ? No . We need to talk . I was thinking the same thing . Were you , now ? The communication stones . What about them ? You took one . It 's the only explanation . You were the first to open the box . You kept one for yourself . And why would I do that ? Maybe you thought it was some kind of insurance policy , I don 't know . You probably thought it wasn 't safe to keep in your room , especially after that whole incident with Spencer 's gun . So you kept one with you . That 's how the aliens got hold of one , and that 's how I wound up on that ship . Oh , well . Doesn 't sound like a denial , Rush . What we should really be worried about is how they found us in the first place . Well , I figure they tracked the signal from the stone ... We don 't even know how that signal works . Maybe they 're smarter than us ? Well , they 're advanced , sure , but not as advanced as the ancients . I suspect it 's something much simpler . Like what ? Subspace tracking device . We took care of the ship you brought over . Yeah , but there may be another one ... Attached to the outside of the hull . Where is this coming from ? I was in direct neural contact with one of the aliens for quite some time . Ever since , I 've been having ... flashes ... images . Of what ? You don 't know ? No , I don 't know , but what I do know is , they 've been tracking this ship for some time , long , long before we got here . For them , Destiny 's something like an obsession . Look , we 're out of FTL , will be for several hours . Now 's the perfect time to take a look . Kino 's through . Mr. Brody , please dial back the tensile strength of the shield . Roger that . You know , it 's a big ship . This could take a while . You have something better to do ? Keep me posted . Can I have a word with you , Colonel ? All right . Not here . I don 't know exactly what happened on that planet between you and Rush , and maybe I don 't want to know . Spit it out , sergeant . Well , we never did find out who put that weapon in your quarters , sir . No . There has been some speculation . I 'll bet . As far as I 'm concerned , we were better off without him . I just want you to know that whatever happens ... Colonel Young , come in . Go ahead . We 've found it . It 's on the underside of the ship . I just ... I fed the kino track into the shuttle controls , so it should lead you right there ... Any time now , lieutenant . Yes , sir . All right , guys , ship 's jumping to FTL in a little over one hour . That 's plenty of time . What is this place ? Well , as far as I can tell , it 's some kind of ancient research lab . Not exactly ideal for our purposes , but the level of connectivity with the ship 's main systems should be adequate . Do we have to do it now ? We 'll never get a better opportunity . You should really get your people in position . Eli ... Hey . What are you doing here ? I want to see the alien ship . You know it 's just parked there to track us . I know , but I want to see it . Come in . There it is . How long has it been on the ship ? Rush says since before we got here , although it 's not entirely clear how he knows . He knows . Weapons hot ... Target locked . Weapons firing . That 's it . They can 't get to us anymore . Brody ... Brody , where are you ? Hydroponics . All right , stay there . It 's on . What , now ? You signed off on this . Yeah , I know , I know . I just ... Stand by . Hey . Hi . Didn 't expect to see you down here . Yeah , I just wanted to check on some of the medicinals here . Right , sure . Brody ! Yeah , yeah , I 'll ... meet up with you in about a half an hour . Okay ? Bye . That was ... That was just ... Volker and his ... bridge club . So ... Okay . Docking procedure . Sir , I 'm reading a negative on the docking clamps . Let 's reset . Still negative . Eli , we 've got a problem . The docking clamps will not engage . What ? That 's impossible . Hang on . Eli ... What the hell ? I 'm locked out . What do you mean you 're locked out ? Someone 's transferring controls to another station . I 've got nothing . Sir , the door won 't open either . We 're jumping to FTL in about eight minutes . What happens if the ship 's not locked down ? The shield won 't envelop the shuttle . And what ? I don 't know for sure . Nothing good , I know that . Eli ... The shuttle wouldn 't go into FTL with the rest of the ship . Which means what ? I 'm not sure , but I think the shuttle would be vaporized . Seven minutes . All right ... Eli , let 's ... Let 's think this through . You said somebody was transferring controls ? Yeah , that 's what it looks like from here . Well , can you do something about it ? Stay calm . Take your time . Five minutes , sir . I 'll bet you a buck . Rush , this is Young . Over . Greer , this is Colonel Young . Go ahead , sir . Take a detail . Find Rush now . Yes , sir . Four minutes . Stop it . Stop it now . Chloe , we 've talked about this ... The shuttle docking clamps won 't engage . What ? You have to stop . But I can 't . They 're going to die . I can 't stop in the middle of this . They are going to die ! Dammit ! Eli , this is Dr. Rush , come in . Go ahead . Now , listen carefully . I 'm in the process of transferring access to the computer away from the control interface room . Now , there 's nothing you can do to stop that . All you 're doing is slowing it down . Let me complete the transfer , then I 'll lock down the clamps manually . Don 't listen to him , Eli . Keep doing what you 're doing . Eli , we 're in no man 's land here . Neither of us have control . Now , let me finish before we jump to FTL . Don 't do it , Eli . That is an order . Two minutes , sir . What 's going on ? The shuttle can 't dock , and we 're about to jump . I didn 't know the transfer would cause this to happen . Shut it down . I don 't have everything yet . If I stop now , Eli 's going to shut me out , and our position will be compromised . - Colonel ? - Negative . Eli , do not let that man take over a single system . He 's doing it anyway . The transfer 's almost complete . I know why you 're doing this . I also know you agreed that nobody should get hurt . We could lose everyone on our side . Shut it down ! I got it ! I got it ! Let 's go . Good work , Eli . So , where do we stand ? How much control do we have ? We 're about to find out . What the hell ? Come on ! Eli . It 's Rush . He 's sealing off corridors all over the ship . Brody , why 's your radio turned off ? Is there a problem ? Sorry ... You weren 't supposed to be down here . Guys , what is it ? What 's happening ? Get out of my way . Put the gun down . I 'm not going to ask you again . Just take it easy . Airman , what are you doing ? Something 's going on , lieutenant . We 're cut off from the rest of the ship . I 'm trying to report to the Colonel , but these people won 't let me through . I 'm sorry . It was inevitable that a few people would be stuck on the wrong side of the line . What line ? We 've sealed off Colonel Young and most of the military personnel . To put it bluntly , we 've taken the ship . Put the gun down . Not a chance . Camile , why you doing this ? Colonel Young 's actions left me no choice . I 'm doing this on behalf of all the civilians onboard this ship . What do I do ? Well , we 're not going to go shoot anybody . Put the gun down . Now , everyone just needs to remain calm . This will be over soon enough . Rush , this is Young . I know exactly what you 're trying to do , and there is no way in hell that I am going to let you get away with it . I 'm not acting alone , Colonel . Besides , What 's done is done . I already have the food and water supplies , plus control of all accessible systems has been transferred over to the consoles on my side of the line . What is it ? That ... That 's not entirely true . He stopped the transfer prematurely so I could lock down the shuttle , which saved your lives , by the way ... Moving on ... That left us control with one key system ... Life support . So you mean that we can shut down the heat and air on the other side whenever we want ? We wouldn 't do that . Do you have any idea what 's going on here ? No . As a matter of fact , I don 't . Am I the only one ? You 've got our attention . What do you want ? All military personnel to hand over their weapons immediately and submit to civilian authority . Is that it ? Well , it does tend to be how civilized people structure their societies , Colonel , be that as in nations or in microcosm . As opposed to what ? Military dictatorship . That 's got to stop . Well , Eli tells me there might be a problem with your plan . Something to do with life support . I was hoping that he wouldn 't notice that . Anyway , I 've done the calculations . We 're occupying a much larger area , therefore we have a greater volume of air . Plus we have the hydroponics lab producing some oxygen . Not enough to make a difference . If you cut us off right now , we 'd have at least three days , which is around about the same amount of time you would have to go without water . If it comes down to a contest ... Well , I 'm not sure what the final outcome would be , but it wouldn 't be pretty . It 's not pretty now . Sergeant ... What did he say ? Nothing , But they 're still pumping air in here . He 'll give in . He 's got no choice . We have the gate room and the communication room . He 's completely cut off . Yeah , but he still has one thing that might make a difference . Come on , buddy , you got this . It 's a very complicated lock-out program , okay ? I 'm going to need some time . So , I got a head count . Lieutenant Johansen and Airman Dunning are unaccounted for , So I think we can assume that they are on the other side . Of course , just because someone 's on the other side , doesn 't necessarily mean they 're , you know , on the other side . Obviously not . We 've got half a dozen civilians , all of which claim to know nothing . What about Chloe ? She 's with them . Like I said ... How 's it coming ? Slowly , and it doesn 't help that I 'm starting to get hungry . Low blood sugar is not my friend . It 's not the food that I 'm worried about . It 's the water . If dehydration sets in , we 're going to be in a lot of trouble . Is there anything we can do about it ? They 've offered a trade . A limited amount of food and water in exchange for Eli . Me ? I 've already agreed to it . Sir , he 's the only one who can get us around whatever Rush did to those computers . I know that , and they know that , and that 's why they want Eli , but there is another way in . All right , guys , I 'm here , and as you can see ... I am alone . Open the door . Whoa ! Irony . Put it down . Come on . So ... Here we are . I can 't help but notice that you seem to be , well , working with these people . What did you think , I was a prisoner ? I was hoping they ... Wait a minute . In the control room , when you came by , were you just trying to distract me ? So that I wouldn 't notice what Rush was doing ? What ? Don 't " what " me ... No ... Of course not . Look , I knew it was coming , but I didn 't know when . Believe me or don 't believe me . It doesn 't matter . I guess ... I 'm just a little surprised you 're taking Rush 's side against Young . Rush was an inconvenience , so Colonel Young left him on that planet to die . Deliberately . The hole the aliens cut in the hull is on the other side of the line , on their six . Suit up . Sir ... Lieutenant , I already told you , I want you here in case it doesn 't work . We shouldn 't have given them food and water . It 's just going to give them more time . That doesn 't matter . They know they 've got no choice . Why don 't they just give it up , then ? He 's a full bird Colonel in the United States Air Force . He 's used to getting his way , but he also knows that every military in the free world takes orders from a civilian government . We just need to stick together until he remembers that . I 'll leave you to it . To what ? Once again , Eli , I find myself in need of your assistance . What exactly are you doing ? We are going to squeeze every last ounce of power out of the ship 's systems , and then when we 're done , we 're going to find some more . What for ? The shields . We 're going to need them . The tracking device was on that ship that we blew up . One tracking device was on that ship . There 's another one ? Surgically implanted in my chest , next to my heart . Colonel ... We got to go . This is insane ! Does anyone else know about this ? Chloe . I had to be sure she wasn 't implanted too . And ? There 's no surgical scar . They 're almost within weapons range . I 'm dialing up the shield . Wait ! Maybe ... Maybe that 's the wrong plan . I mean , maybe we should throw everything we have into weapons . We can 't take on three ships at once . Well , we can 't run away from them either . That 's exactly why I have to do this . If we can survive until the next jump , they 're going to realize they can 't get past the shields , and they 're going to give up . You don 't know that . That 's the way it 's been for a long time , Eli . They attack , they try and get onboard . The ship 'sautomated defenses stop them . They 're attacking us now because they 're hoping we 're going to make a mistake . Don 't ! Eli , do you want to die ? No , but ... That 's exactly what 's going to happen if you don 't let me do this . No ... What 's the matter with you ? Right . What ? Sure . You 'll open the door for Scott and his team , and I 'll go find Rush . I just wanted to see if there 's anything you need . You can let us out of here . Don 't worry , you won 't have to stay in here for much longer . I know , because the Colonel 's going to take back the ship . You don 't have any idea what you 're up against . I think we do . Not a clue . Sorry , but a bunch of civilians up against the Colonel 's training and experience ? It 's about listening to reason . Not once you took the ship . That made it war , and that 's what we do . It 's not going to make life on this ship any easier , and it 's not going to make what those aliens did to you any better . Neither will anything you could possibly say to me . What was that ? They 're back . What 's happening ? Stay here . This is Wray . Report . We 've got company . So I figured . Let 's go . Sergeant ? They 're fine . I went easy on ' em . That 's it . That 's all the power we 're going to get . The shields are holding . Listen up . If you have to use force , so be it , but we still have to live with these people tomorrow . Remember that . Go . Yes , sir . What is going on ? They found us again . How ? We knew this was coming . We 're prepared . Who 's we ? I know Rush is the only person on this ship who has any idea what you 've been through , but it doesn 't mean that you can trust him . He saved my life when Colonel Young was ready to sacrifice us both . We can 't afford to have a majority vote every time a decision needs to be made , Chloe . We need a leader . Chloe ? All right , put the gun down . You guys okay ? Yeah , we 're fine . All right , come on , let 's go . You were surgically implanted with a tracking device . Is that what this was all about ? You thought if Young was in command he 'd , what , throw you out of an airlock ? Given my previous experience , it 's hardly an unreasonable assumption , and , remember , this was your idea . Doesn 't matter whose idea it was . It 's over . Everybody down , now ! On the floor ! Now ! Get down ! I said get down ! Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait ! Just ... Wait . Greer ... Get the weapons online . He can 't . Why ? I created a separate lock-out code for that system . Give him the code . No . We 're under attack . I know . The best form of defense is to devote all of our power to the shields . That 's not your decision to make . It 's already been done . Really ? Well , maybe I should just shoot you right now . Colonel ? Get ' em out of here . Wait ! He has a transmitter implanted in his chest . That 's how they 've been following us . Even if we survive to the next jump , they 'll just track us again . TJ , take care of it . What ? Cut it out . I can 't just go digging around in his chest . She 's not qualified for this . We 'll use the stones . We 'll get someone who is ... We 're not equipped for this . Are you crazy ? This is insane ! You know ... That we 've got to get that transmitter out . Sir , I don 't recommend giving up any military personnel at this particular moment . I 'll do it . I don 't need to know what I 'm doing . It won 't be me , right ? TJ , this is Dr. Brightman . Lieutenant . Thank you . What did you give him ? An anesthetic I made from the venom of a creature we ran into a while back . In low doses , it 'll knock you out pretty good . You gave him alien venom ? Is that safe ? Well , without it , we 'd all be dead right now . Okay . I thought at first we were going to have to go in blind , but then Eli , he 's one of our people , came up with this . It 's a camera . He took it out of a kino . What 's a ... ? It 's like a video transmitter . Anyway , we took it apart and mounted it on that , and that way we can go in arthroscopically . What is that ? Yeah , we 're under attack . What ? Shields are holding . We 're good . Welcome to Destiny . All right , that 's it . That 's it ? We got weapons ? I found a way around the lock-out , but think ... What ? I think Rush might be right about this one . If I 'm reading this correctly , the shields can 't take much more . All the more reason to shoot back . We can 't spare the power . Weaken the shields , even a little , and I think they might collapse completely . Well , that 's what 's going to happen anyway , isn 't it ? Yes , but maybe , if we 're lucky , not before we jump . Maybe ? Yeah . You got something I can hold this open with ? Thank you . Lieutenant , can you hold that , please ? Thank you . Hold it up . Thank you . Okay ... Okay , I see it . Getting it out 's going to be a bit tricky , but ... Are you okay ? Oh , God ! Oh , my God ! Chloe ? Eli , this is Scott . We just lost the connection . What the heck is going on down there ? Say again ? We 've lost the connection . The doctor is gone . Maybe-maybe there 's too much interference with all the enemy fire on the shields ? Fix it . What ? I 'm guessing as it is ! Sorry , you 're on your own . TJ , you get that thing out of him . Shields aren 't going to last much longer . There 's nothing I can do . How long till we jump ? Just over a minute . TJ ... You get that thing out of him right now , or I 'm going to have to ! He 's coming to ! Hold him down , hold him down ! Give him another dose of anesthetic . What are you doing to me ? Hold him steady , hold him steady ... Okay , I can see it . Chloe ... I need you to hold this . Okay ... There it is . Okay ... All right , I got it . Now pull it out . I got it . Give it here . We got it . Shields are barely registering ! We 're jumping ! Okay , we can close him up . Nice work . How 'd we do , sir ? Well , the ship 's taken some damage . Eli 's looking into it . Anyway , we 're still here . All right , everyone , I need all of you to head back into your quarters now . Everyone . Sir , we can 't guard ' em all if we let them split up . It 's over , sergeant . All right , people , you heard the man . Let 's go ! So ... I 'm open to suggestions . Obviously , we need to find a way to work together . Pretend it never happened , you mean . You shouldn 't have left him on the planet . You think I don 't know that ? It 's not over , sir . No , it isn 't .

 In the future , probably Japan . " Robots " have seen practical use for some time . This is an era just after the widespread deployment of " _ _ _ _ " We 've identified the information source . As expected , it 's from the same district . This time it was transmitted via more than five other androids . Somehow , the pattern diverged . Just as we tho- - Trace the centroid . Centroid identified . I 've found it on my end as well . I 'm surprised . That is Shiotsuki 's parting gift , isn 't it ? What are you trying to say ? Shiotsuki 's AI Code : LIFE ; Do you recall that implementation experiment ? The one the supervisor forcefully halted ? I didn 't know what happened until after the experiment . It 's classified after all . All related personnel are under protective observation . It 's all connected in ways I didn 't expect . In any case , a decision was made to protect androids of this district that knew of the café . And it was decided among themselves . Is this your doing as well , Shiotsuki ? Now tracing the first of the deployed units . Time of EVE The log has been successfully written , Master . Question . What is it ? Well ... Cancel the question . Coffee . Acknowledged . Where is--I mean , Status : Family . Your father is at work . Your mother left before my activation . I believe Naoko-sama is still in bed . Time of her return . 3 : 18 A.M. I feel terrible . Then you shouldn 't have gone drinking . It felt good in the beginning . Order your own coffee ! After the party , this thing came to pick me up . I was so embarrassed . What about breakfast ? Cancel breakfast ! I am very sorry . Please repeat that command . One serving of breakfast immediately . Acknowledged . Our domestic food self-sufficiency ratio will soon exceed 80 % . This is the finding from an investigation by the Agricultural Ministry ... Would you eat a tomato created by machines ? In such an age , treasure warmth . Ethics Committee Whoa ! In other words , " dori-kei " is a psychological dependence on androids , yes ? Recently , this is what young people who treat houseroids as humans have been called . We bring you our investigation of these " dori-kei " people . Ah , how disgusting . Aren 't they like clones ? I guess the androids are skilled at various things . Whoa . They 're intense ! Isn 't it lonely ? Not having any friends ... You should be careful too . What do you mean by that ? ... just order it around . Rikuo . I saw your sister yesterday . In the middle of the night , right ? At the station turnstiles . She was pretty out of it . I told you she got picked up . You went ? Our android did . That 's why ... You trust robots way too much . It 's not really a matter of trust . Come on . What are the whatever laws . The three laws of robotics . First Law . Do not inflict injury on humans . Protect humans . Oh . Is that why it went to pick her up ? It 's not like they worry about humans . If you have an android , you should at least think about these things . You 're one to talk . You don 't even have one . Hey , what do you think about this ? I don 't understand it . These are movement records for my android . Which part ? Are you free after this ? I want you to come with me . Where to ? That 's ... I don 't know . What 's up with that ? It 's been acting strange recently , coming home at weird hours . Your robot ? So I got concerned and investigated its movement records . ... And ? Twenty hours ago ; that 'd be yesterday afternoon ? It went out on its own . That 's because ... it had things to do , right ? Here ? Here ? Seriously ? ( You 're lost ) I wonder if the GPS broke ? This isn 't a place robots would come to . Hey . Isn 't it a bit suspicious ? If we don 't go in ... It is kinda suspicious . Then should we go home ? Time of Eve 's Rule In this café , there is to be no discrimination between humans and robots . Customers , please cooperate . Obey the rule and have a fun time ... This is- - Welcome ! Please take any seat that 's free . I 'll take your orders soon . Right . Over there , yeah ? It might only be a short while , but enjoy yourselves , all right ? A café ? It 's a café . Androids going to a café ? They might not be here to drink tea . More importantly , that rule . It seems pretty dangerous . This sits in the grey zone of robot law . Their appearances are hard to tell apart . Hey ! Listen to me ! He 's here . What ? Isn 't that the android from just now ? There 's no ring . You can 't be serious . This place ... is in the grey zone ? Have you ever seen a robot without a ring ? This is a serious breach of robot regulations . You can 't even distinguish them from humans ! Who the hell is he ? Your order ? This . Eve Blend . Evlend . That . I 'll have one too . Two Evlends ! Obey the rule , all right ? Ah . I just thought of something unpleasant . What ? This place 's rule . " No discrimination between humans and robots " ? That 's why there 's no ring . You don 't mean ... ! Assuming that is true , he might not be the only problem . What do you mean ? How do you think it would be if all the other patrons also obeyed the rule ? Those kids are looking at us . Nyaa ! This is a dangerous place . Could be . This place ... What about it ? Tell your dad ? My old man has nothing to do with this ! What ? You guys newbies ? I heard from Nagi-chan ! Nagi-chan is good to talk to . But anyway , can I sit here ? So , how did you find this place ? Are you someone 's friend ? Uh , no we just stumbled across this place . Oh I see . It 's been a long time since we had any newcomers ! Is that s- - It 's always the same people here . The person reading a book is Setoro-san , right ? And on the second floor is Shimei-san and- - Ah ! Cute little Chie-chan ! And over there is Kouji-kun and Rina-chan--aren 't they close ? - -and then there 's Nagi-chan , right ? And who else ... You 're going to wear your hat ? Ah , I 'm Akiko . Nice to meet you ! I 'm Rikuo . Masaki . Rikuo-kun and Masaki-kun . I 've remembered it ! Ah ! Say , um , have you seen a female android around ? One demerit point . You broke the rule . Oh . Sorry . You don 't have to say it like that , since he 's not used to it yet . But- - Infringing the rule troubles everyone ! Nagi-chan . She 's really a good person . She cares about this place a lot . Isn 't it just her job ? Oh no , she 's doing it again . Nagi-chan ! I guess it doesn 't feel like a bad place . Rather , I 'd like to ask : Why did she come to a place like this ? What do you mean , " why " ? I know . She wants to befriend robots . She 's a dori-kei . What . You disagree ? Um . I don 't think it 's like that . Well . You 'd get it just by listening to her . We 're going to be told off again for breaking the rule . Well , there 's more than one way of asking . Oh . Here she comes . I brought them back ! She says she 's sorry . Uh , I was in the wrong too ! What 're you getting all shy for ? That hat suits you . Doesn 't it ? I thought so too ! So , ahem . What is it ? Well , it 's something about the world outside this café . There are no androids at my place . Isn 't that uncommon in today 's world ? You have them too , don 't you ? At your place ? Yep . We do . That 's why I 'm here . What do you mean ? When you are here , you can talk to anyone as you please , right ? So you get to know a lot of things . Like what ? Such as ... the other person 's feelings , maybe ? This has to do with my situation at home . I think of both humans and androids as my family . But no matter how similar we appear to each other , we 're totally different on the inside . We may look alike , but we 're totally different . So I often think , " What do you think of me ? " That 's why I 'm here . I want to talk about various things and be able to understand more . Because we are family after all . Bah . It 's pouring outside . Isn 't your android coming to get you ? I want to know what they 're thinking about . What do you think ? It 's related to Akiko-san . Ah , yesterday 's discussion . Does someone like her count as a dori-kei ? I don 't have any androids , so I wouldn 't know . I have brought your umbrella , Mas- - Isn 't it better to use them that way ? Could she be ... someone who treasures things ? Well . Isn 't she nice ? That 's true , isn 't it ? What are you relieved about ? No , it 's not like that . Well . She certainly was cute . Should we go again today ? I said , it 's not like th- - Aki- - I 'm very sorry for making you wait , Mas- - My bag . Waterproof it . Go on by yourself . Acknowledged . Here is your coffee . As I thought . It tastes like that coffee . I used a different brand of coffee . Huh ? I gave no such command ! I thought Master would be pleased . Why did you decide that on your own ? Are you trying to imitate humans too ? I am an android . Not a human , Master . " What do you think about me ? " But no matter how similar we appear to each other , ( HUMAN Resembles ANDROID ) we are totally different inside . Reversed ? We may look alike , but we 're totally different . I want to understand a lot more . Because we are family after all . Hey . You 're acting like a dori-kei . I 've returned . Isn 't that it ? Ah . I remember that . It 's here at last ! I have brought your change of clothes , Master . Thank you . Huh ? You thanked this thing ? I don 't know . Am I supposed to ? No way . Eh , she 's a dori-kei ? What was that ? ! I 'm telling you . She said she didn 't go to that café . Did you do anything besides your orders- - I did not . What about that ? The thing on your mobile phone . The movement records ? Yeah , that . Could it be a problem on this end ? That 's why I say you trust robots too much . Then are you saying Sammy 's lying ? Sa- - ? Nothing . That 's our android . So it 's called Sammy , huh ? Well . It 's not that I 'm really trusting her . Why don 't you recite the three laws of robotics ? We 're not in law school . Stop arguing and just remember it already , Master . Um . Firstly , Do not inflict harm upon humans . That 's right . Secondly , Obey commands from humans , unless this contravenes the first rule . Oh . So you do remember after all . Thirdly- - Was there a third ? " Protect yourself . " These are the codes of conduct for a robot . In other words , that 's all there is to it . What do you mean ? That is to say , there 's no law against lying . No way ! It 's surprising how you don 't know this . Well , this means that no matter what Sammy-chan says , you cannot fully trust it . She was going shopping this afternoon , wasn 't she ? What ? I 'm talking about Sammy-chan ! She was just shopping , she said . There 's no choice but to confirm for ourselves if that is the truth . We 're going in after all ? What is it now ? Don 't you want to confirm it ? That 's not it . Then that 's fine . Hm ! All right . What 's with that ? I said I 'm going ! Then let 's go . Ah . Let 's go . Ah . Welcome . Hm ? What 's up ? It 's too early to be relieved . It might come in later . We 're going to wait here ? For the time being , shall we stick around until dinner ? But I don 't really want to confront it here . Isn 't it all right here ? But I 'm short-sighted . You can 't see it , even from here ? After all , I can 't see anything if I take my glasses off . Nyaa . Nyaa ! Nyaa ! Chie-chan ! Come down from there ! I 'm a cat ! Oh . I 'm so sorry , lads . It 's best for kids to play around freely . Isn 't it ? Ah , freely . Come along . Give it up now . Those round things are weird . Chie . There 's something that you want to eat , isn 't there ? I am a cat ! And ice-cream ! If you don 't sit down , you won 't get to eat it . Heh . Sorry about that . Once something catches her attention , she forgets about everything else . It 's a piano . Are you going to play it ? I told you . I 've quit playing . I 'll play it . That old man and the kid are both human , right ? No matter how you look at them , they 're human . But you know- - What ? Akiko appears to be human here as well . Huh ? How lonely . I will be lonely too . Can 't we meet everyday ? No . I have my job . You are meeting other women outside , aren 't you ? No . That 's not it . Please don 't leave me by myself . Yes . I know . Shall we go somewhere else ? What were you doing ? Socializing . Order something already . Two blends . Two Evlends ! It 's ice cream ! Here you go . Sorry about the wait , Chie-chan . A cat 's tongue can deal with the cold . You 're scared , aren 't you ? Scared of what ? That Sammy-chan will come . What are you on about ? That your own robot is at some unknown place , doing whatever it wants . " Violating human authority ! " Is that it ? Did your dad say that ? Well . I don 't know . I don 't even have one . Why don 't you have one ? Ah . You 're here . I 'm here ! I don 't get why Sammy would lie . I have more difficulty understanding robots without rings . I 'll be right back . Rikuo-kun ! What ? What 's up ? Eh ? What ? You 're completely different . Heh ? Really ? I 'm so happy ! Uh , by the wa--that 's not it . I have a question . Where 's the ring on top of your head ? It 's off . If I don 't look like a human , it 'll be a violation of the rule . But the robot laws- - All right . This conversation ends here . Ah , Chie-chan ! I 'm a cat . Chie . What 's up ? He 's wearing something weird . Something weird ? Nyaa , nyaa ! What do you want of me , Blade Runner ? Blade Runner : 1982 ï ¬  lm depicting human-like robots . Shouldn 't you do a better job of observing me ? Having a man 's intense gaze on me ... is far from comfortable . I 'm sorry . Violate the rules here , and you won 't have fun . No ; rather , it would be meaningless to be here . That 's what I 've been told . I don 't have it ! Ah . Is it all right to be here today ? Well . Please give my regards to your friend . You 'll get them back eventually , probably . Probably ? She hid my hat before as well . My glasses got taken . So where was your hat ? My hat ? She hid it right ? Ah , that 's right . And then I asked where it was , and Chie-chan had it all along ! Please come again ! She had it ? She hid it inside her panties ! She must have taken a liking to it . Sorry . Something came up . What a nice atmosphere . What 's up with Masaki-san ? I don 't know . It won 't open now . What ? Once someone leaves , it 's kept locked for some time . Why ? We treasure privacy . Um . Is this size all right ? Yup . There 're larger ones . If it 's too big , the other members of the household will find out . All right then . Hold on a second . I 'll get you a good blend . What should we do , Rina-chan ? I 'm extremely sorry . Could you please let us leave first ? Here . Today 's coffee . Sorry for always taking things from your café . Did they like it ? I wonder if they will like it . You could always ask them yourself . I can 't do that ! Why ? He hates it when I try to start things . " Don 't do things on your own , " he 'd say . It 's all right . He will definitely understand you . Well , isn 't this café 's rule a local one ? You can 't compare it with the Robotic Laws . You 're violating the rule again . You 'll get caught . You won 't say no matter what ? I 'll keep it a secret from Nagi , so this conversation ends here . Secret ? You really can keep secrets . You are having quite a strange conversation . Everyone has one or two things that they 're hiding . No , but she 's a- - Ah . Umm . I 'm also keeping something from this girl . I 'm not saying that I won 't lie to her either . But it 's for this child 's sake . Akiko-san is keeping that secret from you ... for your sake too , isn 't it ? " ... not inflict harm upon humans . " " These are the codes of conduct for a robot . " " Did you do anything besides your orders- - " " I did not . " Because I will get hurt . ... For my sake ? To begin with , she didn 't tell you the location of your glasses because ... Haha . She just wanted to play with you . Isn 't that right ? They 're not in her panties ? She seems to have handed it to someone . Oh . It 's already this late . Are you heading back ? I have to prepare dinner . Thanks for this . Hey . Ah . You finally realized . Why did you keep quiet about it ? No one asked . So the customers and staff at this place are buddies huh . What ? Damn ! Rikuo-kun . What 's with this ? Dammit ! Rikuo-kun . ... Doing things by herself ! She 's my ... ! Sit down ! Yes . This cup 's on the house . That girl--when did she first arrive ? She was a bit confused at first , but she gradually warmed to us . Warmed to you ? Yup . She was able to talk to us about a lot of things . The mother who buys her clothes . The nightmare she sometimes sees . The boy who would not play the piano any more . Just the other day , she came in ; Said she wanted to make good coffee . She seems troubled by a lot of things . Troubled ? You don 't understand , do you ? Whether one is doing things right , or wrong . Here . As long as you are obeying the rule , Time of Eve is always open and welcome to you . ... So , in the end , I lost sight of him there . You followed him outside ? I wanted to check if he had anything above his head . That café is definitely up to something- - Um . I was thinking of going there again sometime . Oh . I 'll come with you ! This time we 'll definitely unravel this mystery ! All right . See you then . Say hi to Robot Sammy-chan for me . Question . What is it ? Um , that café ... Master , I am sorr- - Coffee . Understood . Recently , the coffee 's ... been quite delicious , I think . Thank you very much . I saw a lot of interesting things . But I haven 't pinned down anything specific . It 's not related to the Ethics Committee , is it ? If it were , they wouldn 't use such a careless shadower . I 'll let it swim free for a while , see where that takes us . Indeed . Chairwoman Ashimori . As it is , it seems individuality is beginning to manifest . This means the suppression circuit is- - " Assumptions distract from the truth . " That 's what Shiotsuki would say . I will continue my duties . Love isn 't present there . Ethics Committee Hasn 't this commercial been appearing more frequently as of late ? Status : Rikuo . At 12 : 03 P.M. he left the house . It appears he will be having lunch out . I 'm just saying , but you come here really often when you are free , don 't you ? Hm . Skipping classes ? Compensatory holiday . This isn 't something a café assistant should say . Sorry . Rikuo-kun aside , I thought Masaki-kun was a bit of a delinquent . He 's on a scholarship . Quite unexpected . Don 't say anything unnecessary ! It 's not something to hide anyway . Hey . If you 're looking for someone to talk to , there are other people . Do you always carry that with you ? Yeah . I use it to shoot various things . Well . We 'll get around to it eventually . Thanks for the meal . You 're welcome . I 'll bring your post-meal Evlend over . Evlend . Evlend . What ? I 've stopped feeling uncomfortable about it ! Ah ! Not my reading glasses ! Chie ! Give it back ! I 'm a cat ! There might be no point just sitting around . Well . I just want to know what this café is all about . I 've no intention of getting close to any of the robots . We don 't know about anyone other than Akiko . What about them , to my right ? A dori-kei getting sexual with his own android . No further explanation needed . Where are you staring ? Come on . I wasn 't staring ! No , you were- - I 'm saying I wasn 't ! You stared . I wasn 't staring ! You were staring . I wasn 't staring ! You were staring ! You two sure get along well . I 've never been told that before ! No way ! Just two boys getting all excited is pretty lonely you know . The next time I catch you staring- - I wasn 't staring ! At what ? So you 're jealous of Kouji-kun . I 'm not ! He 's just very interesting , right ? Hey ! Why don 't you two join us here ? Wouldn 't it be better not to do anything unnecessary ? Was it unnecessary , really ? I think it would have been more consistent to let things develop independently . Four people will simulate more conversation , right ? He 's Kouji . I 'm Rina . Ah , nice to meet you . I 'm Masaki . This guy here is Rikuo . The next time you stare , I 'll smack you . I wasn 't staring ! Did you see it ? Subconsciously huh ? You two get ... You two get along well , don 't you ? No way ! I 've never been told that before ! Or have I ? Ah . You sure come here often . Yes . Do you two come here together ? No . Separately . It sure is going splendidly , huh ? Ah , is that the Cinema Tide ? Eh ? Oh . Yeah . Can I have a look ? The switch is there . Does he like it ? What ? Ah , it 's beautiful . Can you see a preview of it ? Yes , if you press that triangle over there . It 's a much-discussed model , isn 't it ? I put 500 into it . Oh . That 's right . Because of the n-link , I think . Um , hold on ... Eh . Cine-tide sure is awesome after all ! Um . That 's about it , so ... How do I turn this off ? What is this ? It 's not what you think . Your heart . It 's so far away . No matter how many times we meet , or how intimate we get to each other , I feel uneasy . I finally understand the reason . Please don 't leave me alone . That 's quite a drama . My fault ... I guess ? It is your fault . Sorry about the wait ! Wh-what is it ? What ? I 'll go after her . What 's wrong ? Well . What do you call it ? A scene of carnage ? Protected witness has arrived . I was deployed as my master 's guard . Then , Kouji is ... ? What have I been doing until now ? ! It seems the emergency repairs were incomplete . You came here for Kouji 's , uh- - your master 's protection ? No . I took my own initiative . That leg ; shouldn 't it be looked at by the manufacturer ? I cannot have anything to do with my legal manufacturer . If my maker were to find out about me , my master will be at a disadvantageous position . That aside , I would like to be here a little longer too . Not even going for repairs . In this store , the one who acts least like a human is me . Am I right ? I would not be surprised if I were destroyed sooner rather than later . That is why I am autonomously resisting my useless learning functions . Kouji treated someone like me ... like a human female . I think that 's why I am happy here . But , the woman in that photograph ... You 're kind , aren 't you ? But it 'll be all right , because I think Kouji 's kindness will not change . I guess ... I 'm going back . Excuse me ! The coffee- - When the flavour of the coffee changed , I was angry at first . But when I came to understand various things , I was happy , even if just a little . Uh . Even though the other person isn 't a human ... Tell him ! Tell him what you want to tell him , even if he 's a human ! Why ... do you think that ? You know , don 't you ? The feelings you had at that time . Probably . How did I end up saying such things ? Huh ? So you 're serious about this one ? Huh ? Something 's been bothering me since just now . There is not a single picture of you with Rina . But I guess you couldn 't have such a thing . It would be bad if people knew you had a make-believe lover . No . If this one was a robot too- - She 's not a robot ! Then , all the more reason . What are you doing here ? She 's not my make-believe lover ! Then are you saying this relationship is for real ? " There is love . " That 's not what you 're trying to say , is it ? What you 're trying to say is , " For a human , a human partner is the best . " So you do understand that . I understand . I know that . As you have said , Rina and I cannot transcend the relationship between a human and an android . I think there are things we cannot understand about each other . There 's no way you could understand each other . You see . I want to help my master . Huh ? My master is very similar to Rina . I want to help my master . Yesterday too ; I saw a lot of people . I don 't care about that . But , Master . Master , you should look for a new partner . A human- - That 's enough . I 'm tired . You 're enough . I 'm going to become a robot . So stay with me always . My master is morbidly dependent on me . But I don 't know what to do about that . When I first met Rina I thought she was just like my master . The way she behaves and touches me , and the fleeting expressions she sometimes shows me . I want to know more about Rina , to better understand my master . I want to help my master . It 's the First Law ! About all this ; can you keep it from Rina ? The café 's rule ? I don 't want to hurt anyone . Whatever suits you huh ? Aren 't you being a useless person ? It seems no one can really attain happiness . Thank you . We should get out of here . In that case , please excuse us . I guess there are all sorts . Of humans ? Androids too . Sorry about hitting you earlier . Your eyes were right . I should have taken a good look myself . Masaki . Have you awoken ? I 'm not a junior high student who just reached puberty ! But , Rina is- - No ! It 's the other way round , right ? Hold on . What did you say Rina was ? You came here for Kouji 's , uh- - your master 's protection ? No . She never once said her master was Kouji . ( RINA - - Master - - KOUJI ) She didn 't say it . ( RINA - - Master - - KOUJI ) They have nothing to do with each other outside of this café ? But they both said the other is human . ( RINA - - Human - - KOUJI ) There 's a discrepancy here . Here you go ! Thanks for waiting . They might not have realized about each other . Yup . That 's it for the hints . It 's the same ! Will you please explain this properly ? Partners not knowing what the other is ; It 's the same with androids . They are mutually interested in each other . For different reasons , that is . They also have things they are hiding from each other . So what ? It 's like normal love . That 's considered a good thing , isn 't it ? But don 't interfere too much . Love between androids ... Pseudo-love huh ? So that woman in the photo the other day . Who was that ? A love triangle between androids . It 's a bit hard to explain . A difficult-to-explain woman , huh ? Androids tangled in blind love . Don 't think deviant thoughts ! You 'll tell me about it properly someday , right ? Welcome home , Master . Nao-chan and Mom have gone out for dinner . Sammy , please take care of the rest . What did you put on your head ? Do you not like it ? The likelihood of vagrant androids having corrupted thought logic is dangerously high . Please report all discoveries immediately . Vagrant Robot Reporting Hotline This is a request from the Ethics Committee . At the moment , the Ethics Committee is undertaking independent recovery of vagrant robots that have been removed from the supervision of their masters ... What is this drawing of ? You can 't recognise yourself ? ! This is me ? That 's right ! It is a drawing of * * * * ! Isn 't it quiet ? You mean there are no customers . Oh , but ... Huh ? Have they come back ? This really is a strange café , isn 't it ? In various ways . Ex-excuse me ! Nagi-san , why do you work here ? You can just call me " Nagi . " Because I like it here . I also like the people who come here . So on days like today , when I can 't see the faces of the customers I like , I get lonely . Um , what about us ... ? Huh ? What ? This . Can I get a refill ? I 'll just bring out the beans . Please wait a while . Enjoy your stay . It really is quiet , isn 't it ? It 's an LUH model . A Houseroid model which came out around the time we were in primary school ! It 's still around , huh ? I 've never seen one before . They weren 't very popular back then . There were many complaints that they were hard to use . It seems to be shaking pretty badly though . Do you have some business here ? We 're just customers . Do you understand what a " customer " is ? I am also a " customer . " I am Masaki . This guy is Rikuo . So . Who are you ? Wh-what are you talking about ? Normally , humans introduce themselves . Introduction is a process wherein I communicate my name , is it not ? This guy is trying to imitate humans . Heh . It 's abiding by the rule . That 's right ! It is a drawing of * * * * ! I am called ... * * * * . Why did you cover your ears ? If I do not communicate my name , the introduction cannot be completed . In other words , I will be unable to verify my status as a human . My name is * * * * . It-it 's all right ! You don 't have to overdo it . Overdo what ? The introduction ! Why is that ? Just a moment ago , Normally , humans introduce themselves . ... is what you said . Masaki ! This one cannot deal with fuzzy interactions ! What should we do ? ! Anyway , if we don 't let introduce itself- - What about that sound ? ! For the time being , we 'll have to bear with it . We 're sorry ! Go ahead and say it ! Like I said , I am * * * * . It-it 's a nice name huh . I think so too . It 's a very important name . That 's wonderful . Where do I find a restroom ? But that broken machine , it 's been left alone until it became like that . It should be returned to the maker for repairs- - You 're talking about those things again . But I think today- - Rikuo-kun . He is a customer . You already understand that , don 't you ? Everyone who comes here is the same . Excuse me . Welcome . What would you like to order ? Something seems wrong . It might not be able to decide . This is something new after all . Ouch ! Order ! This . One more cup of this ! I would like to order what Rikuo-sama is having . Yep . Two Evlends ! Going to drink the coffee ? I might be pushing it with three cups . No . I meant the robot . That mouth is just a speaker . What if it tries to drink , imitating humans ? If it does that ... Hey . Hold on ! The Third Law prohibits robot suicide ! Does this guy not understand that drinking could be dangerous ? That is true . It couldn 't possibly be drinking ... right ? Is something the matter ? Coffee is dangerous ! Wh-what are you doing ? What ? Thanks for waiting on the Evlend ! Why ? ! It 's for the customer to drink , isn 't it ? Don 't say such weird things . Hey , hold it ! wait ! Cut the switch ! I haven 't done this before ! Or-order ! Just order it to do it ! Oh . I see ! Drop the cup ! It 's an order ! Why ? " Why " ? She said , It 's for the customer to drink , isn 't it ? Don 't say such weird things . ... a while ago . I am a customer . Ah ! Question ! What is it ? Um . H-h-how old are you ? Age-wise ? This year I will be eight years old . He probably means that he was manufactured eight years ago . You thought I was a bit big to be an eight-year-old human , didn 't you ? No , not really- - No , Masaki-sama . It was written all over your face . Why are you only concerned about this sort of detail ? But I am eight years ... Eight years ... Eight ... There is a conflict between logic and the rule . It cannot answer ! What should we do ? ! Whoa ! Well ! There are many types of eight-year-olds ! There are other eight-year-old humans who look like me , is that right ? That 's right ! I do not have data about that . Please explain in detail . Th-th-th-there 's a frequent visitor to this café ! You mean there is someone who comes to this café , and is eight years old ? What is his or her name ? She-she 's called Chie-chan ! Well , she 's ... Eight years old ... not quite . That 's right ! She 's big ! Like , her voice is ... The most important thing is that it 's believable . What is your job ? I helped with child care . Ehh , child care huh ? Yes . For a couple and their only son . Hey ! Help me out here ! What ? It 's tough doing this by myself , you know . I am a customer . Thanks for the drink . A liquid-storage tank . What was all that hard work for ? The danger has passed , I guess ? Excuse me . Where might Nagi-san be ? While I was looking after her during her nap , I fell asleep myself . Something weird is sitting there ! It 's not good to say such things . Chie-chan , let 's go back ? I 'm a cat ! Umm . Excuse me . She 's called Chie-chan . Is Chie-chan the one who is not quite eight years old ? What ? Whoa ! This person ! This is Chie-chan ! What ? What are you saying ? I 'm a cat ! This person is ... This one here is a cat ! No , that 's just her favourite line- - Can 't we just call her a cat ? ! She said it herself , so let 's leave it at that ! Yes ! I. Am . A. Cat ! Right ! I will escort you to the exit ! Good-bye ! Presently , the data is very complicated . Hey ! Are you all ri- - ? The weird thing fell . Um , is there any way I can help- - I 'm begging you , please . Just go ! How is it ? Can it be fixed ? This is already- - Thank you , Rikuo-kun . But Since we 're here , let 's have a good chat . So , you 've always been working at that house ? Yes . That was where I worked . I was tasked with looking after the son . But now , he has grown to a stage where I 'm no longer needed . That job--did you like it ? Yes . The son bestowed a name upon me . Even now , I remember it well . It 's an important name . That child 's name ! What was his name ? The son was ... His name was * * * * . What about that family 's surname ? Their address ? Contact details ? You ... As I thought . I 'm grateful that you asked about my name . Everyone who comes here is the same . You called me , didn 't you ? Name ... don 't ... forget it ... Yes ! It is a drawing of Katoran ! Is it broken ? It was illegally abandoned . When a new android is purchased , the old one should be returned to the manufacturer . At that time ... The collection fee . Because they didn 't want to pay it , they deleted their personal information . This child , you see , wanted someone to remember it- - Its own name . That 's why it has been evading the Ethics Committee . It probably didn 't know . It probably didn 't even know its own name . That was likely erased as well . That 's just like a robot , isn 't it ? Not realizing that it had lost something ages ago . It remained in this child 's heart the whole time . When it received its name , those precious memories ... Heart ? What do you mean by " heart " ? Masaki . You often said so yourself , didn 't you ? " Because it doesn 't have a heart , it doesn 't understand music . " How long are you going to stay there blubbering ? Stop it already ! What ? Isn 't it strange ? Huh ? You too ? So they also dispose of vagrant robots- - ( Vagrant Robot Report Form ) The Ethics Committee . That doesn 't mean I was doing it . She 's really ignoring us huh . Isn 't that normal ? Sammy is like that at home too . Why is it only different at that café ? Affection is not something they have . This is me ? That 's right ! It is a drawing of Katoran ! In a Time of Tenderness Next up , the front page of Bankei Newspapers . Android job types expand ! It 's big news ! Where 's Sammy ? It made that and went out a while ago . Maintenance ? So annoying . Once every month . Where did it go ? An appliance shop ? Who knows . Probably Dad 's place . I 'm sleepy and don 't feel like eating . Android job types expand . Androids used as school teachers ? Birth of android artists ? The piano . What ? If you 're gonna play at night , turn off the sound ! I am losing sleep because of it . So it wasn 't a dream . Mom was heartbroken ! ( Gone to teach voice training . Sammy , take care of breakfast . - -Mom ) Says she can 't let you help with the lessons . ( Gone to teach voice training . Sammy , take care of breakfast . - -Mom ) Even if I get good , what 's the use ? Hayama Junior Piano Competition Robot gives guest performance . Grand Prix--Rikuo Kikuhara ( 14 years old ) It doesn 't have any special abilities ? Special abilities in an android ? I found this on my old man 's PC . Uh ... It 's an android . Made to be a human being 's father . I 've heard about it- - They 're not actually in use . They want to use them in the future . Read this . ... Operational tests conducted in secret ... Sounds familiar huh ? Not particularly . It doesn 't mean he 's like that . It 's like robots are butting into everything . First it 's art . Next it 'll be love ! Masaki ! Would you eat a tomato created by machines ? Welcome ! You 're alone today ? It 's not like we 're always together . You are ! She 's alone too ? Shimei-san 's got something to take care of . So you handle child care too ? Chie-chan is a customer ! Right ? Nyaa . What 's he up to ? Leaving Chie-chan on her own . I 'm a cat ! Don 't say things like that ! Sure , sure . Hopefully your dad will be back soon . He 's not my dad ! So who is he ? He 's called my ... fos-ter-par-ent ! I 'm back , Chie-chan ! I 'm a cat ! Oh . Rikuo-kun ! Huh ? Where 's Masa-kun ? It 's not like we 're always together ! Sure you are ! You seem kind of out of it . Out of it , nyaa . You 're wrong ! Chie-chan . Let 's read a book ! I don 't feel like it . You know which book Shimei-ojiichan likes ? How about I show you ? Nyaa ! She 's good with kids . That 's because she 's mature . Unlike me . What does Shimei-san do for a living ? I 'm not sure what he does either . Except for doting on Chie-chan . He should have taken her with him . Probably . But Shimei-san 's the one who is suffering . I kind of understand . I 've taken care of her many times . Many times ? Right . Every month . Cats study too ! Are you okay ? I didn 't get enough sleep . That 's not what I mean . Seems like you 're in a bad mood . What does it matter ? You all hate me anyway ! What do you mean by that ? They say there 's nothing in your heart at birth . It 's empty . Cats too ? Right , but you talk with lots of people , and feel and see lots of things , and gradually your heart comes into being . Cats too ? Right , but you 're still a child . You 're going to experience many more emotions . Not just Chie-chan . Shimei-san , us , and also- - Rikuo-san ? The cat understands . Really ? ! Chie-chan understood before I did ! Are you lonely without Shimei-san ? Do you like Shimei-san ? Nyaa . Shimei-san goes off somewhere on his own . I wonder where he goes , if he feels lonely ... Rikuo-kun ! She 's just a child , you know ? Um . Sorry . Bathroom . It 's Chie-chan 's turn now ! Rikuo-kun , excuse us a second . Sure . I can do it by myself . That 's my Chie-chan ! Shimei-shi first brought her t this café quite some time ago . According to that elderly gentleman , she really likes it here . I didn 't mean to bully her . But something bothers me- - It can 't be helped . All human beings hurt their companions sometimes . What are you getting at ? I guess that got you angry . You 're saying I 'm a bad guy because I 'm a human ? You say some interesting things . Do you think robots never hurt others ? What is it that hurts others ? It 's not such an easy thing to figure out . What were your thoughts at that time ? How can you avoid hurting others ? What do you need to understand ? It 's easy enough to say , but quite another thing to put into action . Rikuo-san ! I was saved by you ! Is that so ? This is crap . So you 're going into administrative justice . Seems not many lawyers specialize in robot law . But it 's still tough to get into . What about you ? This , after all ? I 'm quitting . Why ? You mean , because of that thing the other day ? Forget about that . Sure , it can play with precision . But it only stole a bit of the spotlight . It was really ... good . I was moved , I think . By this ? Huh ? It 's lousy . Ah . Right ! I 'm sorry . I lied when I said I could play . But you made it to the end , right ? Really . I just picked it up by watching . I 'd just heard it so many times . That 's all . Play some more , play , play ! Nyaa ! Chie-chan , what did you like best ? When it was all broken up ! Look at that ! Isn 't it amazing ? Hey , Rikuo-kun . Thanks for this . That 's not what you were playing before ! Ma- - Rikuo-san ! Um , I 'm ... That piece you used to play ; I liked it . And Chie said she wanted to hear it . But I 've never really played it . But she still enjoyed listening to it . I 'm sorry for having been so inconsiderate . I tried not to play in front of you . And before I knew it , I 'd stopped playing . I would have hated it if even you got good at the piano . Rikuo-san . But To hell with all that ! I want to hear more ! Sammy might play for you ! Nyaa ! I 'm so happy . She hasn 't been that happy for a long time . It was no big deal . As for me , I left her on her own again . You can 't take her with you ? I don 't want to show it to her yet . Shimei , could it be that you 're ... ? I am needed by her . So I devote myself to her . She is everything to me . My only wish is to make her happy . Just like your performance . That 's why I was so happy . These feelings are genuine . I was moved by your performance , I swear . Is it okay to say that kind of thing ? Just don 't tell Nagi . Have you seen Sammy-chan ? Come to think of it , I think she left when I came in . She left ... For your hard work . About Sammy ; What ? She makes a lot of friends . It 's not like I 'm angry ! You were really cool . This café- - I ... don 't hate it . Thank you . Rikuo-kun ! Right . I 'll explain it at the next meeting . I 'm home . Anyway , take a look at the records . Regardless of what the upper echelon say , this is the best way to study them all . Where 's Dad ? He went to the family court . He is expected to be home shortly . There 's no way Mom did anything wrong . That 's true . But you can 't just blame Dad . Because neither side is completely wrong . But ... I have a favor to ask of you . Sure ! Let 's not tell Dad about this conversation . Why ? Because it would hurt Dad . You don 't want that to happen , right ? So I ask this favor of you . Sure ! Masakazu , there 's a problem . I think it 's broken . Good morning , Tex . Tex . Hey , Tex ! Tex ! Tex ! Next , the report from the preliminary investigation . This shows the places that seem to be inciting excessive humanâ   robot interactions . There 're too many . 1408 places . We gathered all possible information and codified it , baseless rumors and urban legends included . We need to narrow it down . ( Time of Eve ) Unfortunately , not all these places clearly violate robot law . ( Time of Eve ) They 're in the grey zone . That there are so many of such places belies the limitations of robot law as it stands now . But these places must be eliminated . We 'll do a cursory investigation of all the places , and then pick targets for full investigation . After that , hand them over to the media . But it 's impossible given the sheer number ! That 's true , given our manpower . For the first time ever , we 'll use androids for the cursory investigation . We 've already secured a large number . We 're getting them ready now . What happened to your allergy to robots ? Fight poison with poison . Please think of it like that . Continue . We 'll only fully investigate the places if accusations are substantiated by the android investigations . We 'll also record all androids and humans seen at each place and follow up with more investigations . We 'll immediately report suspects to committee members in the police force , and urge them to make arrests . What about our fellow countrymen with the APC ? We 've been told that someone found out about our preliminary investigations . Their relationship with the APC is unclear . Also , lobbying has been quieting down . Don 't forget that some parties will try to trip us up using this investigation . We will issue an absolute order to the android investigators , to keep their ties with our committee a secret . Presently , memories of that incident are fading . We must not make the same mistake again . Go on . I 'm from the media strategy division . About CIO Masaki 's TV appearance- - My wife records them all . Drives me nuts ! I 'd like to emphasize that our Ethics Committee is raising the alarm about robots infiltrating into daily life . That 's all . Woah ! What a lady killer ! Huh ? In what way ? Hey ! You changed the channel ! Thanks for letting me stop by ! Children treat robots like people no matter how primitive the robots are . And that impedes the inter-personal relationships humans should have . One Evlend ! Sure . It 's an encroachment on human dignity . The issue I 'm raising here is- - Hey , why doesn 't Masaki-kun come anymore ? Actually , a lot has happened . A lot ? ! Well . The biggest reason is ... This guy is on TV a lot these days , huh ? Yeah . Like the old days . What 's that ? The Robot Ethics Committee has been around since androids started being used in households . That 's more than ten years ago . I heard that it started out as a radical anti-robot organization . I had no idea . They 've been quiet for the past few years . What do you mean ? Their extremism led to an injury . The Tokisaka Incident , right ? I 've heard of it . Ah . It 's also referred to as an accident . At any rate , they were severely censured , and the head resigned . Since then , they 've been quiet , at least until recently . You 've lost me . Does it have anything to do with Masaki ? ... that is our stance . Thank you very much , Mr. Masaki . Today 's guest for Zoom-in Scramble has been Masaki Atsuro , Chief Information Officer of the Ethics Committee . Masaki . That 's right . His family circumstances ... I invited him today too- - So Masaki is his last name . You 're hung up on that ? Not that ! So , how 's it going ? There 's this café called Time of Eve . Rikuo 's a big fan . Well . I go there too , so who am I to talk ? Humans and androids talk to each other ! It 's totally absurd . Yeah ? Say something . I 'm coming in . Who 're you talking to ? My mobile phone . I hung up already . You had it make coffee ? You 're at home a lot these days . Did something happen ? Tell me everything . There 's nothing . I see . Don 't trust robots too much when it comes to things you eat and drink . THX . We 'll write up the minutes for today 's meeting tonight . The data is in my terminal . Tell Masaki-kun he 's welcome anytime . Sure , I 'll tell him . But don 't get your hopes up . See you . Come again ! Um . He 's gone . You know , I don 't think Rikuo-kun minds anymore . That 's the impression I get . Nagi , you don 't understand Rikuo . I 've known him longer . I 'm sure he doesn 't want to see me here yet . Really ? Hey , who cares about Rikuo ? Don 't say something like that ! I can 't just ignore him ! Oh ? Really ? Don 't go telling Rikuo strange things . Masaki-kun 's not going to report this place , is he ? Nyaa . If that happens , this café will have to close . No ! ... even though it 's such a wonderful place ? Sammy-chan . Do you remember how you first came here ? I thought you called me . I 'm not able to bring anyone here . You probably learned about Time of Eve from someone who 'd been here . And Sammy-chan , you brought Rikuo-kun and Masaki-kun . So if the person Masaki-kun brings is from the Ethics Committee , there 's nothing you can do about it . That 's the end of these connections . And the end of this café . Nagi-san , are you okay with that ? In this café , everyone 's hearts come together as one . I just want to see it through . How big can this circle grow ? Um . Master . Wh-what ? Do you want Masaki-sama to come again ? To Time of Eve . Yes . I 'd like him to come again . Me too . Okay ! I 'll definitely bring him tomorrow ! Masaki ! Today- - I 'm not going . She said she wants you to come again . Don 't just say things . It 's true ! Who ? Nagi-san , and- - Sammy said so too ! She said she wants you to come too . They want me to come ? So what ? It 's a houseroid ! That 's right . You 've ... changed . Masaki , what 's going on ? You 're just like I was , back then . You 'll feel love , only to be betrayed later . It 'd be better if that café didn 't exist . That 's right . It 'd be better if it didn 't exist . Dad ! I want to talk to you about something ! THX is gone . Masakazu , did you give it an order ? No . It just went off . It 's completely broken . Gotta find it right away , and get rid of it . Get rid of it ? Of course ! It 's handled lots of Ethics Committee material . Gotta take care of it before it becomes a headache ! Masaki . I 'm at Time of Eve . Can you help me ? What 's that sound ? An ancient robot--an elderly customer--is here . It says to close the café ! I 'm asking , what is that sound ? The screen ... Anyway , it won 't stop , whatever we say ! And this THX model won 't talk . Hey--what did you just say ? This café is the gray zone , right ? Do something with that robot law of yours , please ? That was fast ! Close this establishment immediately . Tex , stop it . T-Tex ? What are you doing here ? Oh , so that 's what this is about ? You bring someone 's robot , and you want to make a scene , huh ? I don 't know how you brought it here , but you guys got Rikuo 's robot to come here . You can do all kinds of things . This is a strange place , after all . Nagi didn 't bring it here . Aki-chan . You 'll go that far to get me to come here . I 'll tell you my story . It brought me up , long ago . It was my best friend . Then one day , it suddenly stopped talking . I was a kid , and thought it was family . I felt hurt and betrayed . That 's it . No big deal . There must be a reason why it didn 't talk . I agree . It doesn 't look so broken down . I know . I was only four or five years old , but I could guess what was going on . My dad ordered it to stop talking . Told it not to talk , no matter what happens . He tried to drive us apart . Just like something my dad would do . Orders from parents get priority . Masaki-kun , you 're very perceptive . What does perceptive mean ? I didn 't know that when I was a kid ! I kept trying to talk with it ! I even cried and apologized ! If commanded , it can ignore a crying , wailing child . For years . In the end- - They can 't understand people 's hearts ! ... use androids in the cursory investigation . This café called Time of Eve ... I go there too ... Record all androids and humans ... urge arrests . ... should be eliminated . I am going to br-break th-this café 's rule . You are in violation of Robot Law 9 , Article 3 . According to data in my possession , you are an android . If an android turns off its ring while in motion , it is in violation of robot law . What 's going on ? Why is Tex speaking ? What about Dad 's command ? A command . It 's breaking a command . Breaking the Second Law is allowed only if upholding the First Law . The First Law means ... danger ? A human here is in danger ? Can 't be . Who does Tex know to be human ? Only me . I 'm in danger ? Tex is speaking ... to protect me ? So , it is necessary to take legal action against your owner . I require information on your owner . We will issue an absolute order to the android investigators , to keep their ties with our committee a secret . Masaki ! Masaki ! I 'm not letting go ! Until you talk to me , I 'm not letting go ! Tell me ! What were you thinking ? For so many years . All that time . Watching me ... all those years . You were right there with me . Tex , help me ! Speak to me ! I couldn 't speak to you . I always wanted to be at your side . I ... I always ... Masakazu-kun- - It wanted to protect you . I know that much . It won 't speak once the danger has passed . It 's still bound by Dad 's command . You wanted me to understand too , huh ? But , even so , I can 't accept this . It might be impossible now , but someday , surely , it will talk . Don 't just say things . You 're wrong . It 's not like I don 't have a reason . But I can 't express it well . I 've seen so many things here . There 're many problems . It 's distressing to see them each time . But it feels like the right path . It 's the same for you , Masaki . I 'm sure . You might be right . I 'll tell Dad that I brought you out of the house . I ... always ... Masakazu-kun ... Let 's go home . How did it get in ? I held it . I lifted it up . You really are demanding a lot ! Someday I 'll get you to thank me for today . I love everyone . I 'm so happy we can all be here . They 're going home together ! It 's all right . Should I have helped them ? No . It 's enough that you watched over them . It might have turned into another dangerous incident . I 'm sure Shiotsuki understands that much . But is this really related to Shiotsuki-shi ? That café 's classification ... If I recall correctly , that was 1138 . 1138 . " Our country 's robot force will continue to act upon prioritized orders . " That would make sense . Code : LIFE 's suppressed reformation isn 't working . This is all to prepare for that time . To think that someone other than Shiotsuki could ... But- - One more thing . An article about the Tokisaka Incident , from when it happened ? ( Android control taken to new extremes ) No , this is ... It 's the real article , before the contents were replaced . A girl , five years old at the time . If by chance she is still alive ... Time of Eve Kept I forgot to bring out your Evlend today . I thought something was missing . How did Tex get to the café ? You don 't know ? You know ? I thought you were a regular here . Rikuo , you 've got a long way to go . Still a long way ? Huh ? Someone new ? I 'm going to say hello . This is my tale of the Time of Eve . Welcome ! Take any seat that 's free ! I 'll take your order soon . Many more things happened to me , but ... You might not be here for long , but enjoy yourself ! ... that 's another story . kouen no BENCH de waratteita We were laughing on a park bench natsu no asa , sougen ga midori ni kagayaiteta The summer morning shone upon the green grasslands hontou wa mienai kimi no hitomi donna iro I really can 't see your eyes ; what color are they ? kimi ga miteru sora wo mitsuketakute I want to find the sky you 're watching I have a dream sasayaka sugite totemo It 's very meager kimi ni iesou ni wa nai I can 't seem to tell you what it is keredo asa ga kuru me wo kosuri However , the morning comes and I rub my eyes hitogomi wo aruiteku I 'll walk through the crowds kurikaesu hibi no naka Within these repeating days chiisana yume wo sagashi tsudzukeru Continuing to search for my little dream toki wa yuku bokutachi wa surechigai mata deau Time goes by ; we pass by each other and meet again kogoeteta fuyu no hi wo kamishimete I dwell on a frozen winter day asa ga kuru kaze ga fuku The morning comes and the wind blows hitogomi wo aruiteku I 'll walk through the crowds kimi no tame boku no tame For you and for me sekai wa yume wo tsumugi tsuzukeru The world keeps on spinning its dream I 'm back . Looks like it 's still fine . You worked hard . Though it doesn 't smell like salt anymore , I still like the café as it is . It 's in the city , so lots of people gather there . How is everyone ? You look sad . She ... Ever since she was broken by Ashimori , she 's been feeling insecure . They- - Will they find happiness ? No matter how many times I try ... How many times has it been now ? The third time ... Or fourth time ... They- - Will they be able to laugh ? I ... Your children are laughing- - Alongside humans . I feel insecure . It 's unbearable . It 's all right . Someday , definitely , it will extend beyond the café . Something happened today to make me think that . Won 't you tell me about it ? The main character is a certain boy . So today 's story is ...

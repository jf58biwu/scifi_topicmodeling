 - Ready ? - Yes . I carried you both . I need to see her . I don 't think that nine months of gestation entitles her to risk us all . Hey , look ! Helena is my twin sister . - She has a right to know . - Because you shared a womb ? Helena is dangerous . She 's had her whole world turned inside out . Just like I have . How Helena takes this determines what we do with her . I need to see you privately . Away from here . - What for ? - I have something for you from back then . About my in vitro treatments . Okay , I 've got a place we can meet . Helena , this is Amelia . Your birth mum . Hey , look ! Hey ! You listen to what she has to say ! Or I 'll put right back in the trunk and I 'll take you straight to Leekie . How can you be my birth mother ? Helena , I am birth mother to you both . Who 's here ? Monkey , you 're not supposed to be up . What 's the matter , love ? I think something bad is going to happen again . Yeah , that 's what this is . A connection . We were implanted by doctors , all of us . You split inside me into two baby girls . And I hid you because I felt you were in danger . Sister ? You 're my twin sister . I don 't want to be your sister , meathead ! Look , I just want you to know , you 're not the original . Got it ? You were born of science . Not of some immaculate womb or whatever bullshit Thomas fed you . This is the police ! Shit ! Sarah ! - This is your last warning ! - Sit down . You 're just visiting . - Sarah Manning , come out now ! - Sarah Manning , come out ! Put your hands on your head . Turn around . Sarah Manning , you 're under arrest . Let 's go ! BBC America Orphan Black 01x10 - Endless Forms Most Beautiful Original Air Date - June 01 , 2013 Sarah . I still see Beth . I didn 't kill her , Art . No , you watched her commit suicide . And then you went straight for her wallet . Beckwith finished Jane Doe 's facial reconstruction . Who 's this one ? You 've been obstructing this investigation from the minute you took over Beth 's life . You 're the prime suspect , Sarah . - I didn 't kill her , Art ! - You know who did ? We 've got your foster brother Felix in custody for abetting . And your daughter , she 's gonna be one lonely little girl unless you start talking . You wouldn 't believe it . Yeah ? Try me . Good ! Slide it out again , go ! Good , come on ! Feel it work , go ! Push it up . You got it . Clap it high . You know what ? Slide it out for two . Here 's two . Slide it to the right again . Go here ... - Yes ? - Alison . Dr. Aldous Leekie . - It 's a lovely home . - I 'm warning you . I 'm armed . What do you want ? To make amends . So , you want me to sign a contract . More like a treaty . Rules both sides will abide by . Even though everything you 've done is illegal . You must think I 'm so stupid . Stupid suburban Alison . Quite the opposite . You 're a pragmatic and decisive individual . And now that you 're self-aware , we can start to answer some of your questions . I don 't want answers anymore . I want my life back . I want my family back . I want my privacy back . I want you out of my life . And I want things to be normal again . I 'm so glad you said so . This enshrines your family 's freedom . Guarantees protection from the likes of Helena and ensures you 'll be unmonitored . - Unmonitored ? - Yes . But in return , you agree to twice yearly medical testing . Private and noninvasive . I don 't want to scare you , but there are health concerns . Katja 's respiratory disorder . Helena 's mental illness . Regular testing is in everyone 's best interest . So , read it over . And discuss it with Sarah and Cosima . And as a gesture of good faith , your monitor has been lifted . She has ? Don 't get up . Purposely misidentified the body of a police officer ? It was a terrible case of mistaken identity . You know , it 's fraud by false representation . It 's two to five with your priors . I thought it was my sister . Do you know , Angela Deangelis , I 'm actually quite a fan . But you really need to get laid . Yeah , tell me about it . But all I seem to meet are gay men . So , public defender then , is it ? We 'll get you a real shitty one . Thank you . Cosima ! Please don 't be alarmed . I 'm beyond alarmed . I 'm pissed ! Let me give a lift to your hotel . I have an offer you may find interesting . It 's your phone . Well , it 's Beth 's phone actually . So , help me wrap my head around this . Art , if you 're hearing this . We found a body . It 's not Beth . It 's me . My name is Sarah Manning . And , you 're about the only person I trust to figure the whole thing out . Sarah , my partner killed herself . I didn 't see it coming . Help me . Help Beth . I know you care . There 's a reason we look exactly the same , Art . Okay . Why the prints match , and the DNA 's all screwed up . But you have to promise to protect me and my daughter . If that 's what you need . I promise . - Detective , this interview is over . - What is this ? Sorry , Art . Miss Manning , I 'm your lawyer , Daniel Rosen . Unshackle her , please . Miss Manning will be leaving with me . Thank you , gentlemen . Miss Manning . This is an employment contract for the Dyad Institute . Very generous compensation . We want to work with you , Cosima . You 've got to be kidding me . This is your complete sequenced genome . 3.2 billion base pairs . My offer is the freedom to study yourself and your sisters . Unfettered research . We share the same concerns , the same questions about organism stability , but nobody is more invested in your own biology than you . It 's yours . Just think about it . Where are you taking me ? We had your brother released as well . Who 's we ? You work for Dr. Leekie ? Indirectly . Great . Should have known . Can we have a minute ? You left me hanging with Leekie when you didn 't show up with Helena . Do you work for Leekie now ? They still have Afghanistan on me . Understand ? And why is that ? You changed the game for everyone , Sarah . Now I can only help you from here . Listen to what they have to say . Do I have a choice ? Right . Sarah Manning . So , my name is Rachel Duncan and we are going to come to terms . The agreement defines mutual disclosure and formalizes contact with what I call top-side . Top-side ? So , is this the part where 20 more of you robot bitches walk in for effect ? You 're not an orphan anymore , Sarah . We found you . And my role is to transition you into self-awareness . Clone fixer . Brilliant . You know , maybe it 's time I just embrace my clonage and went on Oprah . We could be famous , you and me . We 're not the enemy . Helena and her ilk are . And we 're going to help with that . You wanna help ? Why don 't you tell me why ? What am I doing , sat here looking at you ? What are we for ? Disclosure is defined herein . We want your trust . You want precious answers that cut to the core of who you are . But , above all , I know you want to make the right choice for Kira . You 're very lucky . Motherhood is wonderful . Forces behind Helena will never stop , Sarah . The most important thing in this for you , is protection , for you and your daughter . No , thanks . I 'll get by on my own . Scrambling to stay alive ? You 'll remain free to live as you wish with Kira . Provided for , unmonitored but available . Call it sovereignty association . Like I said . I 'm not interested . Take 24 hours to think about it . Midnight tomorrow . They 're offering us security . A truce . Rachel didn 't feel like a truce , she felt like a gun to the head . Okay , little reminder . While you and I were being arrested , Helena escaped . Thank you , Felix . Would you also like to remind me my birth mum popped around and Helena 's my twin sister ? Jesus Murphy ! - Hey . - Hi . Hi . Sarah , I so should have listened to you about Delphine . You all right ? A career at the Dyad Institute . Yeah , studying us . What are you going to do , Cosima ? Well ... We have to know our own biology . That 's what this is all about . Right ? Maybe I can help us best from the inside . I want to know what you are going to do . Well , I can 't trust this Rachel bitch , can I ? Not if Kira 's the first child of a clone . Scientifically unclassified , she could be what Rachel is actually after . Who is Rachel ? Can someone tell me , so she doesn 't just show up at my door and I have no idea who she is ? Um , Amelia said she heard of doctors back in the day discussing a child raised by Neolution . She 's a pro-clone . God , you three are weird enough . If there won 't be any more spies in my life , if my kids are safe , I 'm sorry , but I have to tell you I 'm inclined to take the offer . Yeah , that 's okay . That 's totally your choice . Yeah , no judgment . Shit ! Delphine just got off a plane . Here ? Stupid lady bitch . Right . She wants to help , right ? Just like Art , Paul , and Rachel and everybody wants to help . I 'm going to Mrs. S 's . I 'm going to be there when Kira wakes up . Okay , Chap - Yeah , I mean we make our own decisions , but I wouldn 't trust anybody . - Katja Obinger . German ? - Yeah . Finally ID 'd our Jane Doe and she falls under federal jurisdiction . This whole thing reeks . Hey , you still wanna get to the bottom of Sarah Manning ? I found a known associate . I guess my turning point was when the love of my life , well , let 's just call her Sarah , Sarah broke up with me by faking her own death . Initiating events which began with the loss of my finger . Led to various other humiliations and ultimately to the business end of a nail gun . That 's when I just said to myself , " I need help , I need help . " So ... Like I said before , my name 's Victor . I 'm an addict , maybe , you know ... So ... Peace out . - You 're moving . - Yes . Chad got his own place with the dog and I got a very handsome offer on the house . It 's the perfect opportunity to get the kids out of this toxic environment . That 's priceless . Goodbye , Alison . I 'm packing . - Alison , get out . - Admit it . Admit what ? That I organized your intervention ? My bad . Sorry I care . Dr. Leekie came to see me . Who ? Cray cray ! If it 's professional help , I 'm all for it . I want the truth , Aynsley . The truth is that you screwed my husband and I 'm moving because of you ! Look at this . Yours . Gifts from my best friend . A felt Christmas angel ? I made that ! - Yeah ? - Yes . Well , to hell with you and your Christmas angel . You ... You turned this whole thing around on me because you 're jealous . You 're barren and you can 't have your own children ! My God . Alison , help . Alison , help . Alison ! Alison ... Aynsley . Aynsley ? Aynsley . - Nice speech . - Yeah , I 'm moved , personally . Hey , isn 't this place off limits to you guys , you know ... Sacred ground or something ? Not if you got an outstanding warrant for selling stolen meat . No , smoked pork . I didn 't know it was stolen . You know what , that 's lame . But I 'll take the collar . Hey , come on , come on , man . - I 'm trying to turn my life around . - All right , okay . So then give us something useful on your femme fatale Sarah Manning . Of course , Sarah . Step nine of the program , I got to suck it up and apologize for shit that I did to her , you believe that ? But since she 's not gonna apologize back ... Last time I saw Sarah , she was playing housewife in the suburbs . Husband , kids , minivan , whole shebang . That ... That isn 't Sarah Manning , is it ? No . That is another person entirely . You got to be freaking kidding me . When police come , Mommy goes away . No , darling , not this time . She 's back . To keep us safe from Helena . Don 't worry about Helena , Kira , okay . I don 't , she 's not a real monster . Okay , we 're gonna have to hide this bag . We might have to go on a trip , but you can 't tell anybody . Okay ? Not even Mrs. S. It 's a secret , yeah . - Promise ? - Okay . Do you have a spare toothbrush ? - Go get it . - Go . Where are you off to ? Meeting Amelia . You all right ? Just edgy with Helena in the wind . Yeah . Sarah , mind Amelia . Why ? It 's true , right ? That she 's my birth mum ? Yeah , it ... it all seems to track , just ... - She didn 't raise you . - Yeah , I know . You did . It was all a long time ago . You all right ? Yeah , yeah . Sorry . Now I get it . Um , is Cosima ... It 's Delphine . She 's got baggage - You know , if Sarah were here , she 'd kick your wormy ass . I promise you I did not tell Leekie about Sarah 's child . What difference does it make ? Why are you here ? Because I ... Because Leekie is a liar . And I think you can prove it scientifically with that , your synthetic sequence . He gave me my whole genome . Yes , but you ... You can 't find that sequence anymore , can you ? He would have scrubbed it . Hey . Don 't . I 'm on your side now . Please believe me . You need to trust someone . I think the sequence is ... A message , um ... Like a ... Dr. Craig Venter watermarked his synthetic DNA . It 's ... It 's a key to our origins . May I ? Okay . Thank you for meeting me , Sarah . - Drink ? - Just water . That poor child , Helena ... How can two fates be so different ? You two are like ... night and day . Thank you . I 'm sorry to bring you such burdens , but I must warn you , Sarah . Your foster mother , Mrs. S , she 's not who she says she is . I have something you should see . How did scientists put babies inside you ? What ? You gave me to them . You let them make me this way . Helena , what have you done ? We missed you , sister . Come join us . Alison . Donnie , I ... Ali . Ali , you 're shaking . I 'm a horrible person . No , no , honey . I am . I let those people in our home . They had no right to intervention you like that . They don 't know the real you . Judas Priest , what have I done ? No , no . No , no , no . Doesn 't matter . We can put it all behind us . - Every little bit of it . - Really ? Yeah . Really ? Okay , here 's the synthetic sequence . And this is the differentiated portion . Yes , this is , an encrypted ID tag , it 's how they tell you apart . Okay . But how to decode it ? I have four nucleotides to work with . G , C , T and A. And no idea how they are encrypted , I mean there 's thousands of permutations . - And we are running out of time . - Yes , but I know your tag number . - You do ? - Yes , I saw it many times . It 's numeric so , if we know how that translates then we can figure out the rest . Okay , what is it ? It 's 324B21 . Right . I 'm 324B21 . I 'm sorry . Well , let 's run these letters through a decryption program . Yeah . Helena . Helena . None of these results match the ID tag . Okay . Okay , think . We 're molecular encoding from 30 years ago . Yes , but we 're looking at it from now . Of course , they weren 't coding nucleotides . They used whole base pairs ? Not four letters but two . AT and GC . Ones and zeros . Binary . They were coding in ASCII . Shit . Amelia . Amelia . Keep pressure . I 'm gonna get you help . What 's this ? Your foster mother . She what ? She what ? Foster mother . She ... She what ? My twin . Amelia . I 'm sorry . Mother isn 't very well . She 's dead . You psycho . You killed someone I 've been dreaming about my whole life . She separated us . She tore us apart . But now we 're together . No , we 're not . You 're nothing to me . Just some crazy bitch wearing my T-shirt . London Calling . Scientist made one little baby and then we split in two . So , I cannot kill you , sister . Like you could not kill me . Sarah , we make a family . Yes ? I 've already got a family . Okay , moment of truth . It 's your ID tag . You cracked it . Let 's see what else there is . Okay . C-A-G-T-G-T . Rachel Duncan . It 's Sarah . Yes , Sarah . I wanna know my daughter won 't have to live like this . We can do that . I 'm coming in . One down , two to go . What 's going on over there ? None of our business . Your track suit ? I 'm going for a jog . I 've been a lump . You deserve better . I feel like a weight has been lifted . - All right . - Okay . - Here we go . - Bye . - See you in a bit . - Be safe . I will . Going up ? - Sarah . - Don 't . You asked me what happened in Afghanistan . I was a private contractor . I killed six marines , friendly fire . They covered it up . That 's what they have on me . If you were born outside their control , what do they really have on you ? - Yeah . - Sarah , you can 't make a deal . - Why not ? - Any freedom they promise is bullshit . They 're liars . That synthetic sequence , the bar code I told you about . It 's a patent . - A Patent ? - We 're property . Er ... Our bodies are biology . Everything we are , everything we become belongs to them . Sarah , they could claim Kira . They patented us . Back on track , I think . It 's the seven year itch . It 's not easy . She 's not easy . You know what to do . This organism and derivative genetic material is restricted intellectual property . I 'm sick , Delphine . Siobhan ! Kira ! Kira !

 Previously on " The Lottery " ... No woman on the planet has given birth for six years . One hundred human eggs have been fertilized . - What do you suggest ? - A lottery . Let every woman out there have a chance to hit the jackpot . You 're under arrest , Dr. Lennon . You stole a human embryo . That 's a class-a felony . I can make this go away . The President wants you to be the scientific face of the lottery . I certainly can 't say we 're on the verge of finding a cure . Nothing could be farther from the truth . You signed an agreement . If you don 't cooperate , that deal goes away . We now believe that we are close to finding a cure . This is the guy who fertilized Brooke 's egg . Mr. Walker , there are only six 6-year-olds in the country . I 'm sure you understand the compelling interest in Elvis ' health and well-being . Word of a kidnapping . Elvis Walke ... was taken from a local hospital last night . I get it . You 're all over the Internet . Stay as long as you want . I got an army buddy . He 's gonna hook us up with new passports . When do you leave for your Asian-appeasement tour ? Tomorrow afternoon . When I get back , who knows ? Maybe we could actually go out on a proper date . Presidents come and go . Men like us ... serve a higher purpose . Nathan and four other diplomats were just taken hostage in Shanghai . - What do they want ? - Five embryos . Hello . My name is Dr. Alison Lennon . I want to invite you to participate in the national lottery . This is your one and only chance to participate in this historic event . The testing centers will open this evening at midnight across the country . You must show your National Medical Card , and submit to a blood test ... and a brief physiatric exam . Our goal ... is to make sure all potential surrogates are healthy and prepared ... for the responsibility of motherhood . Cut ! Five top diplomats kidnapped in Shanghai . Just got the download now . Marco Wilson , Carlos Ruiz , Deborah Gaines , Janet Oh . Nathan Mitchell . And this is confirmed ? Agent Daniels ? Yes . Hi . This is Dr. Alison Lennon . We spoke last night . Right . Just checking to see if there 's any new information on Kyle Walker . Okay . Well ... if you do find him or some other agency finds him , please let me know right away . It 's extremely important . Dr. Lennon . Sorry . It 's me , the director . I ... I forgot to ask ... Would you mind signing something for me ? My wife asked me to bring this . Okay . So , how soon will it be ? The cure ? When can we start having babies again ? I 'm not sure . Here we are in sunny Southern California , a place once renowned for world-class amusement parks and childhood vacations . Now it 's just a sprawling mass of houses , buildings , and military installations . But if you believe the President and Dr. Alison Lennon , those empty ferris wheels and roller coasters will be filled once again with smiling children ... and beaming parents . We 're talking to young women all over the country , trying to understand their perspective on the national lottery and try to bring you , the public , the truth about the most compelling medical mystery and moral conundrum in the history of mankind . - What 's your name ? - Leslie Cole . - And how old are you ? - 25 . - Did you sign up for the lottery ? - No . I was going to , but then ... that scientist , Dr. Lennon , came on TV last night , and she said that things are gonna get better . So I figured I 'd wait . And do it the right way . The right way ? You know ... fall in love ... get married ... like they used to do a long time ago . So , you believe we 're close to a cure ? That 's what Dr. Lennon said . And she 's the top fertility scientist in the whole world . The debate over the lottery continues . Will women sign up , or will they wait for the return to normalcy ? - We shall see . This is Jack ... - If they only knew . Southern California . They 'd do it anyway . Hey . At least it 's not you on the news . What 's your hurry ? Gonna meet my army buddy in Buffalo . Get the new passports . Look , Camille , about what happened , uh ... No worries . I needed a stress relief , too . So , what do you think you 're gonna find in Canada ? A normal life . Government 's different there , you know ? You 're not under the microscope like you are here . They never take your son away for being 20 minutes late . At least , that 's the hope . I 've been thinking about your situation . I have money saved . We could hire a big-shot lawyer and face this head on instead of running . - I can 't take your money . - I don 't care about the money . - Camille , it 's not your problem . - Could be . We could solve it together , like ... Like a family . I can 't . I ... I don 't mean in a romantic way . I mean me , you , Elvis , Lila ... Just two adults trying to make it work and do something for their kids . The whole world wants what we got right here . Yeah . I thought about that . But the Department of Humanity would never let it happen . How long are you gonna keep running ? 'Till they quit chasing . BUFFALO , NEW YORK And we 're storming bolivar Plaza , 200 marines , guns blazing , ready to blow out the rebels . Then it 's 10 old dudes playing dominos . Those were the days . - And then there was La CaraneÃ ± a . Remember her ? - Oh , yeah . Remember her name ? Eloisa . Oh , my God . Hottest woman I ever met . Then you showed up at the bar . - That was a long time ago . - Hey . She liked you more than me . What are you gonna do , right ? You know , I 'm sorry about that . I was drunk , too . That was 10 years ago , bro . It 's all good . When we used to worry about getting girls pregnant . To Venezuela ? - To Venezuela . - How about a real drink ? - Gave it up . - Come on . For old time 's sake . Have one . - Can 't . - Can 't or won 't ? Both . Got the pictures . We 're going to need new names for the passports . Your son ? - Yeah . - Good for you . No wonder you don 't drink anymore . There 's $ 350 there . It 's all I got , man . Just make sure that Elvis says his age is 10 , not 6 , okay ? No problem . I 'll call you later to touch base ? Appreciate it , Jason . All the hostages were American diplomats . There was a security breach at the Shanghai Airport . Whoever these kidnappers are , they 're pros . - And they 're demanding embryos ? - Yes . Five . - We contacted the Chinese government ? - No . Not yet . Hold off . It 's too risky . They have zero tolerance when it comes to hostage situations . Once they go in , they won 't discriminate . They 've initiated contact . Keep them talking as long as you can . If they 're using a mesh network , we need at least two minutes . Make sure to block our video feed . Greetings , America . I assume we have your attention now . You see , that is the problem with America . There 's only one way to make it notice the rest of the world . These pawns that you sent to China ... we know they are valuable to you . And if you ever want to see them again , you 'll do exactly as we say . My name is Vanessa Keller . I am the Chief of Staff . I speak for the President . We demand ... the immediate release of the hostages . I don 't give a crap about your high school Mandarin . We will speak in the language of the imperialists . We want five human embryos . That is not possible . Again , we demand that you release the hostages . Did you really think you could keep these embryos for yourself ? ! Did you really think the rest of us would just sit back and applaud ? ! Or maybe you just want us all to die off so you can finally take over the world for yourself ! What organization are you with ? Who do you represent ? We want five embryos , nothing else ! Wait . - We need proof of life . - Proof of life ? Here 's your proof . Talk ! - Tell them you 're alive ! - I 'm alive . Please , do whatever you have to ... oh ! You have 24 hours . Was that enough time ? Did we track them ? No . Vanessa , what the hell is going on ? A group of Chinese terrorists kidnapped Nathan and four other diplomats . Did he say anything to you ? Were there any agenda changes ? I don 't know . I never got a chance to see the final schedule , so I 'm not sure . You 're his senior adviser . How do you not know ? I was supposed to be on the trip with them , and Nathan wanted me to stay here . I was on the way to New York for a meeting when you called , so I-I don 't know ! Things are happening real fast . Okay , well , go back to your office and review his e-mails , texts , phone logs . Look for anything unusual . Anything . And say a prayer . You okay ? Look ... I know what happened yesterday was not your idea , all right ? I get it . But now we got to deal with it . The American people think we 're on the verge of a cure . Our co-workers do , too . I said we were actively working on a cure , that I believed we were close to finding one . I never said we found one . Okay , you 're right . I ... I lied . I just stood up there on national TV and ... We need to find Kyle Walker . He has to hold the key to all of this . All right , so what do we tell our colleagues ... And our partners ? Nothing . For now . We do whatever is necessary to buy some time . We say our research is confidential , and then we ... Turn the lie into the truth . We figure out why we were able to fertilize those one hundred eggs . I 'm sorry . Isn 't that what we 've been trying to do ? So we try harder ! Those eggs were fertilized for a reason . It wasn 't magic . So let 's figure it out . That 's how we justify this . " We " ? Yes . " We " . We 're a team . Thanks , Jason . Hey , you got no idea how much this means to me . Cool . See you this afternoon . Okay , buddy . Time to test your levels . Come on . You 're all good , superman . - Go get your stuff . We got to leave . - Why ? 'Cause we 're headed for the big lake up north , remember ? Why can 't we live here ? - ' Cause we can 't . - I don 't want to go . Elvis ... I know this is hard . We 're gonna have our own house soon . We can have Lila come and visit us . Can we play one more game ? No . No , we don 't have time.I still got to get gas . I got to go and buy food and ... Okay . Okay . One more game . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . Coat . I don 't need to explain how important these individuals are to this country . or to me personally . So let 's try to resolve this . What do we actually know so far ? According to our Chinese analysts , the lead terrorist is ZiyÃ ³ u Chen , member of the new maoists , a ragtag group of Chinese dissidents . I encountered these guys five years ago when I ran the agency . They kidnap westerners , make outrageous demands , and then kill the hostages anyway . What about their demands ? For five embryos ... Is that off the table ? I want to bring these men and women back home . But I 'm not prepared to offer embryos . Play it again . Here 's your proof ! Wait a minute . What ... What 's he 's doing ? - What do you mean ? - Nathan . Can you go ... Can you blow it up and rewind the video feed ? Stop . There . Play it . He 's saying something or mouthing something . Looks like he 's praying . - Well , in situations like this ... - He 's not praying . Can you enlarge it ? Get a lip reader here now . I made sandwiches . You 're awesome . Are you expecting somebody ? No . Elvis . Ready or not , here I come ! Where 's Elvis , honey ? Which way did he go ? There ? Okay . Elvis ? Hey ! Nobody can find me ! What 's going on ? I need you to keep real quiet , okay ? - Why ? - Just do what I say . Come on . Kyle Walker ! Freeze ! Come on , let 's go . Department of Humanity ! Put the boy down ! Just put the boy down ! You heard , do not move ! Come on , let 's go . What is he saying ? Can you slow it down and push in on his mouth ? 44 . - 44 ? What is that ? - That 's the first thing he says . Keep going . And the last thing is " Avenue " . He 's giving us their location . Now for the middle piece . " Do-something " . - Doulan . - Doulan Avenue ? - 44 Doulan Avenue . - Does that exist ? Does that exist ? Got it . It 's a warehouse just outside of Shanghai . Not too far from the airport . Get Langdon . Tell him to contact the SEAL team . How 's it going ? Buy you a drink ? Sorry . I don 't do bar bets . - You think pretty highly of yourself , huh ? - Look , I 've had a long day . I just want to be alone . Call me old-fashioned , but I like to start off with a cocktail or two , have dinner , maybe even learn the person 's name . You really are old-fashioned . Do you listen to Coldplay , too ? Hey , wait . Wait a minute . You 're that scientist , right ? The one that fertilized the eggs . Yeah . But , uh , but I don 't sign autographs . A vodka soda . And ... Sure . I 'll have a dirty martini . My name 's ... - Hey , wait , wait , wait , wait . - I 'm sorry . I have to go . You know , what pisses me off is I saved that bastard 's life in Venezuela . You don 't know if he sold you out . Sure he did . Then again , 20 grand 's a nice reward . It 's not that . Some people just hate to lose . Mr. Walker . - Yeah ? - You 're to come with us . Wait . On whose order ? The White House chief of staff . Today 's your lucky day . How long before the seal team arrives ? They 're en route . That 's all I know . I looked . I couldn 't find anything helpful . How about you ? Anything new on your end ? No . I still can 't believe this is happening . - I 'm doing everything I can . Trust me . - I know . And I 'm sure ... Nathan knows , too . He told me about you guys . I know what 's going on . - Doesn 't matter right now . - Of course it does . It matters a hell of a lot . Okay , this is not the time or place to get into this , but I will not recuse myself . I 'm the only voice in that room trying to get them out alive . What are you talking about ? I don 't want you to recuse yourself . You 're the one person that will fight for him . Don 't worry , okay ? I can keep a secret . GOVERNMENT FERTILITY LAB Mr. Walker ? - Who the hell are you ? - I 'm the one who got your ass out of jail . Thank you . Dr. Alison Lennon . Why ? Why what ? Did you get me out of jail ? Because you fertilized one of the eggs . You mean one of the one hundred ? - This lottery thing ? - Yes . It 's the reason I was able to call in the favor . And now I need a favor from you . I need a sperm sample . We think you can fertilize more eggs . This is our collection room . I don 't know what you 're into , but I 'm sure you can find something . There 's also a variety of lubricants , so I 'll leave you to it . I won 't do it . Not until I get my son back . The chief of staff personally arranged for your release . Yes , because you need something from me . I want my son back , Dr. Lennon . And I want the kidnapping charges dropped . Mr. Walker , I 'm a research scientist . - There 's a limit to what I can do . - You know why I was in prison ? You broke the law ? The Department of Humanity took my son , my 6-year-old son , for no reason . They wouldn 't tell me where he was . But I finally found him . He was locked up in a state hospital alone and scared to death . Now , what kind of father would leave his son in a situation like that ? So , yeah , if that 's breaking the law , I 'm guilty as charged . But unless you get these ridiculous charges dropped ... I 'm not doing you any favors . I 'll see what I can do . Notify me the second the SEAL team arrives in Shanghai . Great . Thank you . Vanessa Keller . Vanessa , it 's Dr. Lennon . I need to talk to you about Kyle Walker . - Didn 't I just get him out of jail ? - I know . There 's something else I need . I have some good news . The chief of staff has arranged to have the abduction charges dropped . - And my son ? - She 's arranged for you to see him . He 's on his way here now . Thank you . I appreciate it . She wasn 't able to dismiss the custody hearing . She tried , but ... The Department of Humanity has too much autonomy with children under the age of 10 . The Executive Branch doesn 't have any control over it . The legislation was designed that way . They still want to take away my son ? There will be a hearing . The judge will listen to your side of the case . Yeah . I 'm sure he 'll be real objective . I did the best I could . I know what bastards these guys are . Trust me . I 've been there . Daddy ! Hey , little man . Hey . Hey . Oh ! How you doing , huh ? Hi . Do you need something ? Are you hungry , or ... do you need milk ? I need to go pee . Okay . So ... That means ... so ... so you can reach ... or do you need some help ? - Where 's my dad ? - He 's ... he 's busy . What 's he doing ? He 's ... See this ? This is a microscope . Helps me look at things up close , like really , - ... really close . - What do you look at ? Cells . Trying to create a human embryo . It 's , uh ... an embryo is a ... fertilized egg . It 's where ... humans , people , come from ... Or at least we used to , anyway . Hey , buddy . That was fast . I think your son needs to use the bathroom . The SEALs just arrived at the warehouse . We look forward . Perimeter secure . Target in sight . They 're awaiting your order , sir . Send them in . - Green light . - Breach her up ! Attaching charge . - Come on , let 's go , let 's go . - Come on , come on , move , move . Clear . Entering . Check number two . Flash bang ready . Go . Go . Go . Let 's go . - Room one , clear ! - There ' s nothing . - Discharge . Number two . - He 's about to explode . - Go , go . - Left side clear . Right side clear . Location is clear . No sign of hostages or hostiles . They 're not there . Where the hell are they ? We 've checked drone surveillance , informants on the ground , phone chatter ... nothing . So they 're in the wind ? - Seems to be that way . - But how ? - How ? Where 'd they go ? - How 'd they know the SEALs were coming ? What are our options ? First we need to alert the Chinese authorities.We can 't ... keep this quiet any longer . Last thing we need is to escalate an already bad situation . They 've reinitiated contact . Sir , perhaps we should ignore the call . What ? - Ignore it ? - Unless we 're prepared to offer embryos . - The consequences of that are ... - Troubling . I agree . Unless ... we offer fake embryos , animal embryos . What are you talking about ? I just spoke with Dr. Lennon . She said it 's virtually impossible to detect animal versus human embryos in the earliest stages of development . How long before they would notice ? - Few days . - It 's risky . It 's less risky than doing nothing . Worth a shot . Offer them two embryos . We don 't want them to think the offer is too good to be true . Shit . - Still nothing ? - No . His sperm didn 't penetrate the membrane . Again . Were you ever exposed to any unusual dose of radiation , - ... any toxic events ? - My first marriage . No . Not that I know of . According to ... your records , you were in the army , saw the world . Yeah , all the bad parts . Why all the questions ? We 're still trying to find the answers . I thought the answer was my sperm . So did I. Well , it 's not ? No . Not right now , anyway . Well , that 's too bad . I was hoping ... Thought maybe I could help , you know , put an end to all this madness . Yeah , me too . - What 's that ? - I need a blood sample . Is it necessary ? Your sperm isn 't working . But you 're still the last man to impregnate a woman . And we know you fertilized one of the one hundred eggs , so , secret has to be inside of you somewhere . I don 't like blood . Thought you said you were in the army . Exactly . We need to identify their new location , so get ready . - Before you start offering up a ... - You good to go ? You got it . ZiyÃ ³ u ... I have good news . We 're prepared to offer you two embryos . We said five . We were very clear about that . Yes , I know , but I had to beg the President to even consider ... Five is the number ! ZiyÃ ³ u ! ZiyÃ ³ u , what are you doing ? No , no , listen . Please . Stop . Stop . What are you doing ? We can work something out . This is a negotiation . Okay , listen to me . We can work something out . We can ... listen to ... Stop it ! Please ! Don 't shoot ! No ! Do we know who was shot ? From ... this angle , based on height , foot size , it appears to be Nathan Mitchell . Wait . He 's wearing a wedding ring . Was he married ? The victim is wearing a wedding ring . No . Nathan was not married . It 's Carlos Ruiz . Vanessa , can I have a word with you ? Why the hell would they say no to two embryos ? They didn 't even counter . What the hell is going on ? - They are not interested in negotiating . - Maybe we go back to them . We offer them five . They 're not real embryos anyway , so ... - ... what difference does it ... - Vanessa , for God sakes , you 're missing the point . Really ? Enlighten me . If we keep playing around with these terrorists , we 'll compromise our national security interests and dilute the most precious asset we own . - Which is ? - Our reputation . Whether we give these clowns human embryos or gorilla embryos doesn 't matter . Whether our people die or go free doesn 't matter . The world will look at us differently . Less respect , less fear , which will invite more attacks and abductions , which will , in turn , chip away at the psyche of the American people and dilute our once mighty brand even more . Listen . Right now we 're the country no one wants to screw with . It 's the thing that keeps us safe at night . But I swear to the almighty lord , we keep jerking around with every Tom , dick , and ZiyÃ ³ u that comes along , we will become the country people are not afraid to screw with . So ... If we have to sacrifice five of the nicest people you ever met for the greater good of the United States of America , so goddamn be it . - What 's so urgent ? - I analyzed Kyle 's blood sample . He has an anomaly I have never seen before . Here . Take a look for yourself . Okay , look . All right , see those long terminal repeats ? Now , the order of the capsid genes is reversed . Some sort of retro-virus . - I don 't recognize it . - Yeah , neither did I. It took me all afternoon to figure out what it is . Well ? It 's the black death virus . As in the bubonic plague ? That thing died out in the 16th century . Yeah . Yeah , that 's what I thought , too . So , the most fertile man in America has the bubonic plague ? Come in . Have a seat . What 's our next move here ? Sir ... I want to save our men and women ... Very badly . But I believe ... we should step away from the negotiating table . I appreciate your honesty . And objectivity . The hostage crisis in Shanghai has ended in tragedy . It is now confirmed all five U.S. diplomats were killed in a failed rescue attempt by Chinese police . The names of the victims will be announced soon . You okay ? I know the President did the right thing , but ... It still hurts like hell . Nathan was the only one who gave me a chance . If it weren 't for him ... I cared about him . I did . And I know you did , too . I need you to calm down and listen . You promised we 'd get out alive , that the Chinese army would not be notified . What the hell happened ? - Are you the only survivor ? - Yes , I ran out the back . Chinese army came in shooting . They killed everybody . You sold us out , didn 't you ? You notified the Chinese army . You called them . - You set us up . - Relax . I 'm going to take care of everything , I promise . Are you alone ? - What ? - Are you alone ? Yes . You son of a bitch . Go on . Say it ! - ... Say you love me . - Leave me alone . Come on . I dare you . - It 's just a bunch of words . - I won 't tell anybody . Come on . Just say it . Speak the truth . You want the truth ? The truth is this . I really ... really ... L-like you ... great deal . You just can 't go there , can you ? I love you , Nathan . A new day is coming . One filled with joy , laughter , and children . Soon , there will be one hundred new families in this great country of ours . This is the beginning of our rebirth . Alison ! What are you doing here ? Are you stalking me ? Do you live around here ? Two blocks away . Pretty sure this is what they call serendipity . Yeah . I don 't do serendipity . Sorry . Come on . It 's like one of those ... old Hugh Grant movies . I hate romantic comedies . Okay , I 'll leave you my number . If you feel like calling , you call . If not ...

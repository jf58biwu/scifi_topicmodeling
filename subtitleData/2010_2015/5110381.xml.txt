 Previously on Continuum ... You and me , working together ? Hm-mmm . It doesn 't exist ! I will kill you ! Come on . You call them " Freelancers " . They have no formal identity . [ Silenced gunshots ] They 're more of a cult , and the time continuum is their chess board . People like us are a liability because we understand what 's at stake . I had this memory from when I was little ... it was me , my mom , and Jason . What if Jason 's my ... It 's easy enough to gather the proof . A little DNA . What is it , Emily ? I need you to pull me out . You have feelings for him ? Yes . He 's a good man , and I think he 's doing the right thing , and I don 't believe we 're ... Emily . I don 't pay you to think . Excuse me . CPS coming through , excuse me . The victim 's name is Ramona Cathers . Sadtech Engineer . I know , I already spoke with her wife . Bio places time of death at 23 : 42 : 18 . Liber8 's getting lazy . They had to know we 'd cover this from every angle . Grid scan display ? What 's wrong with the image ? CPS Main , this is Officer Cameron requesting enhancement grid points 383F . It 's some kind of cloaking tech . Yeah , and more advanced than ours . They 're scrambling digital signals from every conceivable angle ! Excuse me . This grid disruption is unbelievable . We have no way of identifying the killer . We 're doing everything we can , sir . According to her wife , Ms. Cathers was working on a high security project for Sadtech . Any details ? Apparently she never discussed it , but I accessed her message service and I pulled the logs . Most of them were routine , but this one was marked " urgent " . What is it ? I 've already run the schematic through the CPS data hub , couldn 't find a match , but her engineering specialization was anti-matter . Data tracking shows her visiting the penitentiary over a dozen times in the past two weeks . It doesn 't add up . Why there ? Excellent work , Cameron . I 'll take over from here . Sir , if I could speak to someone from Sadtech , maybe find out a little bit more about her assignment , it might have something to do with the execution ... Leave it . This case is being bumped upstairs . But sir ... Officer Cameron . Dismissed . 2077 . My time . My city . My family . When terrorists killed thousands of innocents , they were condemned to die . They had other plans . The time travel portal sent us all back 65 years . I want to get home , but I can 't be sure what I will return to if history is changed . Their plan ? To corrupt and control the present in order to win the future . What they didn 't plan on , is me . What the hell is this ? It 's play money . You use it in a game , which seems to be what you 're playing . We have a bigger problem , and I 'm still waiting for you to solve it . You mean Escher ? I 'm not interested . You see , you don 't get to dictate the terms of our little arrangement . And you do ? If you stop funding me , I may just have to let Travis know where to find you . Last I heard , the person he wanted dead most of all was you . Tables have turned . [ Painful grunts ] Well , isn 't life full of surprises ? Hey , how 've ya been , buddy ? Not as good as you . [ Choking ] Fancy clothes , luxury lifestyle ... we came back here to change things . NOT embrace them . [ Choking ] I admire your passion , really I do , but all good revolutions have resources . I can help with that . You don 't have anything that I need . Sure I do . You just ... don 't ... know it yet ... There 's no Fisker . Come again ? The last place I could tie Gardner to was a law firm : Fisker and Associates . He found a trail , thought they might be working with freelancers . The landlord said he dropped by on a Monday and the place had been cleaned out . Businesses close , and it 's safe to assume Gardner had other cases . No , Gardner was obsessed with this . You miss him . What about this guy ? You miss him ? Lucas isn 't dead . No , but his shrinks say that he 's psychotic and violent . He 's gonna be roped in dope for the foreseeable future . As long as he 's alive , he 's a threat . He keeps telling the medical staff that he 's from 2077 and that he talks to dead people . I think we 're good . What is it ? Jason drifts in and out of reality , Lucas has gone off the deep end ... what if time travel does something to your mind ? You seem sharp enough . For now . [ Text message alert ] Uh , I gotta go . Alec , I hate to ask you this but ... But you 're going to . We couldn 't find Gardner through ARC , maybe it 's time for a more covert search . I didn 't break into the CSIS server when it was available to everyone , I 'm not gonna do it now . Why can 't you just phone a supervisor and say that you 're worried ? Or is that too straight forward ? Who knows what Gardner told them about me ? Well how about I tell you something ? I coupled the time travel device with Lucas 's software , it is way ahead of anything that I could have designed to date . In what way ? The interface can access the geotemporal matrix . Ok look . I may be from the future , but that doesn 't mean I speak the language . Ok . Pick a date . An hour . With this interface , it looks like I can trigger the device to create that moment in time . You 're saying I can go home . Once I figure it out completely , yeah . Thank you . You wanted me to come alone and look something over ? What 's up ? Thought you 'd appreciate the discretion . Over an abandoned car ? Who 's is it ? Nobody 's . No owner , not a rental . Pretty slick . Been here long ? Couple of weeks . No tickets . This could be why . Under the seat . You gotta be shittin ' me . [ Gagging ] Oh , shit . If you 're unhappy with my methods I can always move on . So you 'd leave ? And that is what passes for love these days , is it ? You want to be free of this arrangement . There 's something in his lab , a sphere . Bring it to me and we 'll consider you terminated . I can walk away ? No repercussions ? Free and clear . And Alec ? Stay with him , if you 'd like . I 'll rest easier knowing he has a guard dog . Staring at it won 't make time travel arrive any faster . So what will ? A reliable power source . The amount of energy required to initiate a temporal rift isn 't something you can just pick up at your local hardware store . But it is available . Theoretically , yes . A company named LaRoche is working on an anti-matter power generation , its huge yield stuff . LaRoche AMTech isn 't viable until the 2040 's . Then you 're history . But , your good friend Escher just bought LaRoche Energy recently , coincidence ? I think not . Then I 'll talk to him . I 'll persuade him to let us take a look at it . But even if Escher could provide the power source , there 's still other factors . Say you returned to the exact time and place that you left . There 's no guarantee that it 's the same life that you left . I 'm willing to take that risk . You leave and there 's no one else here to stop the others from continuing to change history . There 's every chance that you return to 2077 to find nobody waiting for you . No Greg , no Sam , maybe nothing at all . I can 't accept that , Alec . And I won 't . I 'll secure the anti-matter , you make this thing work . I 'll step through and I will take my chances . Promise me , Alec . Promise me . I promise . Word is Gardner was investigating your partner . Kiera didn 't do this . He was all over her , maybe he found out something she didn 't want him to know . Couple of bodies were snatched from the morgue , he and Kiera were investigating the case together . Must have got too close to whoever took the bodies . Hello . I 'm gonna call this in . I need to look at that . Come on , Carlos . You know procedure . She 's my partner . He 's a federal agent ! There 's no way that I ... Just hold off on filing it for an hour , tops . So you can wipe away all the incriminating evidence ? You know me better than that . Hey ! We take care of our own . Hey ! I understand you 're the genius who persuaded Alec to destroy ARC . I can 't make him do anything . Come on , we both know that 's not true . The kid 's getting laid for the first time in his life , he 'd rob a bank if you asked him . Pretty much what you did the moment you asked him to go into business with you . Hey , I 've invested millions in Alec Sadler . I 'm all in . My plans aren 't about to be hijacked by some smug piece of ass , however buoyant . You don 't want to do that . You know what else I don 't want to do ? Tell Alec what I found out about Mia Heartwell . It 's a cute last name . Two years , less a day , for extortion , two assault charges , no convictions ... the last 18 months are murky for now , but I do love how you disappeared right after the mysterious death of a boyfriend . Suicide . You must have been heartbroken . I was . You know who else will be heartbroken . Alec , after he learns you work for Escher and that you 've been stringing him along so your boss can screw him out of his future . You 've been a bad influence so far . I 'm giving you a chance to turn your life around . Convince Alec to resurrect ARC . Or better yet , have Escher give it back . I can 't do that . You can , and will . Or it all comes out . He might think he loves you , but he hasn 't even met you yet , has he ? Hey . I 'm thrilled we made a real connection here , Mia . Big kiss . You know this is a CSIS key drive , right ? And I 'm not supposed to ask why you have it ? Sinking ship . You sure you wanna board ? Ok . So what I 'm about to do never happened . Thanks . That 's weird , there 's no encryption . Woah . I knew Gardner had a thing for Kiera , but this is stalker level . Is there anything about dead bodies , or the morgue ? As far as I can see this is all about making Kiera look like she was linked to Liber8 . It 's pretty compelling , too . Maybe she was more sympathetic to their cause than we realized . I mean , some of the things they stand for ... make sense . That could be what Gardner found out and ... This was planted . Kiera 's being set up . ARC 2 ? Uh , no . It 's sort of like a power device . How does it work ? It 's the early days , eventually I 'll be able to tell you everything . It 's ok , I 'm teasing . You 're doing your thing . I wouldn 't have you any other way . Good . Hey , are you alright ? Alec , I have to take off for a while . I 'm sorry , I know it 's kinda sudden , it just can 't be helped . And it 's not you , don 't even go there . What is it ? Hopefully I can come back in a few weeks . Hopefully ? Ok , maybe it 's closer to a few months ? Ok , stop ! Just stop ! You need to tell me what 's wrong , I mean it ! You know I 've had trouble with my past . It looks like some of it is catching up with me , and it 's just easier if I hit the road . Well , can we call the police ? I can 't . Do you even know where you 're gonna go ? Probably Thailand ? I mean , I have to leave but I don 't have to be miserable . Yeah , unlike me . I 'm sorry , Alec . I don 't have a choice . You know I have a passport . Really ? Yeah . Yes ! Pack your bags right now . I don 't want you to wake up and change your mind ! Hey ! You need to turn around and get outta here , come on . I 'm sorry , what 's going on ? Gardner 's been murdered , and the only evidence points to you as the killer . We haven 't got long . Must have been the freelancers . Yeah , try explaining that to Dillon and CSIS . " It 's a couple of shadowy guys that know I 'm a time traveller who shot him . " Ok , so I need to steer clear of here . Use those super senses of yours to stay outta sight , huh ? I 'll be in touch . I 'm not sure this is enough . We 're gonna be beach bums ! If you have shorts and a t-shirt , we 're ready to go . Really ? I just don 't feel right leaving it here . So we 're really doing this ? We are ! You can leave that behind , too . You 're leaving yours ? Well , where am I gonna put a phone on a nude beach ? Nude beach ? You 've never been to a nude beach ? There 's naked people . [ Email message alert ] Alec ? It 's the DNA results from that test that I did on Jason . He 's a 99.9 % genetic match . He 's my father . The test could be wrong . Genetic testing 's an advanced science , it 's as certain as it gets ! Your father died . Apparently , that was a lie ! Maybe the results of the test are , too . Documents can be forged , results can be mixed up . Why are you trying to dismiss this ? I don 't want you to get your hopes up . Why not ? My whole life I thought my father died in that fire , but now I know who he is and I know he 's alive ! Chances are he 's not going anywhere . Look , you must realize I have to speak to him . I have to go . Really ? You have to hop on a plane right now ? That flight has been delayed . Go into the storage room , lock yourself in . You 're protecting your girlfriend , that 's sweet . Not gonna help , but ... Emily ! Leave , or I 'll kill you ! Please don 't hurt her ! [ Agonized moan ] Too late . What you 've done isn 't just grounds for suspension , it 's an indictable offense ! You suppressed evidence concerning the murder of a federal agent . You will serve time for that , now how much time depends on whether your involvement goes beyond this cover up . You actually think that I had something to do with Gardner 's murder . You ? No . Well , that 's something . Don 't make this worse than it is . Where is Special Agent Cameron ? Kiera didn 't have anything to do with Gardner 's murder , I guarantee you that . We can take stock in that guarantee , Detective . [ Plays on recording ] " He doesn 't exist ! I will kill you ! " " I think we may be onto something here . " Unfortunate he didn 't take that threat more literally . Carlos , listen to me . There 's loyalty , and then there 's stupidity . Don 't let Kiera take you down . Let me make this very simple for you , Detective . If we don 't have the answers we need from Cameron within the next 24 hours , then I am publicly declaring her a Liber8 terrorist and pursuing federal obstruction charges against you . Ok . Ok , I 'll bring her in . But we do it my way . Understood ? He 'll do the right thing whether he wants to or not . Fine . But my people shadow him . Stop hurting her ! She 's fine . Aren 't you ? I 'm fine . You try to contact anyone , I 'll kill her and then I 'll kill you . Just tell me what you want . You may be a genius , but you 're not very smart . You activated my CMR . I didn 't know you had one ! [ Screams in pain ] Let 's proceed from a place of truth , Mr. Sadler . You invented it , or will , and now you 're gonna make my CMR work with that . I don 't know what model you have , it 's completely different ! [ Screams in pain ] Ok , I 'll do it ! I 'll do it . Does she know the truth about you ? What you become ? See , he designed this chip that kills compassion and accelerates aggression . Turns ordinary soldiers into extraordinary killers . You 're an extraordinary asshole . No , he programmed that , too . It only gets much , much worse . You want something that only I can do ! There 's a price . You 're negotiating ? I do this , and you just kill us both . Let her go first ! I mean it . Look at the balls on you . Alright , I 'll make it easier . You do as I ask , and both Romeo and Juliet get to live . Why should I believe you ? Cause that 's the deal I already made . The freelancers have increased their vigilance . They killed Gardner . They come out of the woodwork as required . Because I 'm here ? And Liber8 ? Good fishing . Maybe there 's a way to dry up the pond . I could get back to my time with your help and prevent all this from happening . I have the anti-matter , Kiera , you have ... The device that sent me here . And its inventor . He would be willing to work with you . A ring-side seat to the world changing forever ? Not if I take the device with me , and you agree to protect the technology . Protect ? You mean destroy . We could work together . And Alec ? He sees the dangers . So do I. And I want to help end this ! I am not doubting your sincerity , but you carry destruction in your wake . You 're the time bomb . We 've always had mutual interests . I 'm no longer convinced that 's true . [ Cell phone buzzing ] Excuse me . Connecting your CMR to the suit is going to require a hard reset . How long will it take ? It 's a military CMR , I don 't know . It could take ten minutes , it could take ten hours . [ Screams in pain ] You better figure it out , for all concerned . Alec , stall him . I 'm on my way . Ok , I 'm ready to initiate the re-set . Then do it . Alright , here goes . That 's more like it . [ Agonized screams ] What did you just do ? ! We gotta get out of here ! I 'm sorry , ok ? I 'm so , so sorry ! Are you ok ? We should go to a hospital . What the hell was that back there ? A Liber8 terrorist knows you ? And wants you to hook him up to your inventions ? And that suit ! And what was all that bullshit about the chip in his head ? ! Except maybe it 's not bullshit because that guy is freakishly strong ! And then you flip a switch and everything goes ballistic , and I don 't know what happened but you 're gonna tell me Alec , I swear to god ! Great , I 'm gonna start crying ! God dammit ! I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , ok ? I never meant for any of this to happen and I want to kill him for what he did to you ! No . You 're not the guy that kills people ! I just , I wish I understood what was happening ! Ah , that 's good . That 's nice . Aaah ! That was a little rough . Where is Alec ? Hard at work , I trust . Unless he 's canoodling with his Teen Dream . I approve of the impulse , but his taste in women ... Aaaah ! You came into this world crooked . My mother says I was a beautiful baby . Nobody 's gonna say you 're beautiful when I 'm done with you . Kiera , I thought we had a deal . Don 't , Kiera ! [ Muffled screams ] Travis got into the lab ! But nothing was broken , not even those high tech locks , which means YOU gave him access ! The danger was in the lab long before he showed up ! How much do you know about Emily ? She works for Escher ! She gave him ARC ! It 's been a set up from the beginning . Escher 's the common enemy now , even Travis can see that . You 're working with Travis . He 's going after Escher , he needed the suit , the interface ! You just set off a bomb , you idiot . Alec is gone , and so is the time travel device . I told him not to leave Alec alone , ok ? And the device is mine . You better hope it was Alec that got away with the device and not Travis , because if it is , you just signed our death certificates . [ Phone vibrating ] Emily . It 's Alec . We got away . We ? Me and Emily . Travis nearly killed us ! Do you have the device ? Yeah . He 's got it ? We 're going someplace safe . Alec , about Emily ... Where are you going ? My lab assistant . Ok , please be careful . Ok , I 'll talk to you later . Come on , this is where he lives . Who ? My father . You 're gonna make a phone call for me . Right now . [ Text message alert ] [ Phone rings ] Hey , what 's up ? Nothing much , babes and brewskies all around , you should come by . Your place ? Normally , but my buddy Jason is hosting . Huh , you don 't say ? Yeah , the guy has a great view , you 'd swear you could see the future from his rooftop . Maybe later . Call was too short . Do we know the caller ? ID is random , it was probably a burner . [ Phone rings ] Lewis . Well , find him . He shook your tail . Mark of a guilty man . We always have tea at my house . Always . It 's good for what ails ya . It 's really rare , though . Well , rare in the future . And milk . My mom thought tea would cure the apocalypse if , and when , it happened . You know my mom , Ann Sadler ? Yeah , do I ? I remember you , from when I was little . Hmm . You and my mom , together ? Hmm ... that was , that was after the cage . I got some sugar . Let me get that . It 's ok ! Ann ? Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah . It was really nice there , with your mother . She didn 't even get mad about all my nightmares . I used to get pretty loud , really loud . Wooaaah ! You were there in our house . I remember . She loved you . That was quite something to see . Yeah , you 're a lucky boy . Lucky . What about you ? Lucky ? Not so much . Well , I got lucky a few times down by the big old ... That 's not what I meant . No , it 's not . It 's not . You left . Didn 't you ever have any feelings ? For ... ? For me ? Oh , of course I did ! Yeah ! I mean , you 're my uh ... you weren 't really there . You weren 't there ! Go easy . I was there all the time . I mean , I watched you . Even when you were seeing where I was , I was watching you . Why 'd you go ? To protect you . It was dangerous . We both had to go . I didn 't want to go , but ... But you had to protect me . Yeah . I brought this . Some things need to be kept secret ! Know what I mean ? Shame it doesn 't come with a gun . Oh , there 's plenty of weaponry left . Woah ! You 're an asshole ! I 'm sorry , babe . It 's been a while . This feels great ! You know what else is gonna feel good ? Taking down the protector . Have you got a way to track her ? Let 's just say we 've got a deep connection . I 'm the one that you can 't trust . I was hired to get close to you to find out what you were developing . To keep an eye on you . It started before we met at that coffee shop . I followed you there . Sat in your sightline . So when I spoke to you ... You barely did . I introduced myself . Remember ? We didn 't really meet ? You were my target . Observe , meet , engage . And get ARC away from you . So we were a lie ? Everything was ... of course it was ! Jesus , you were asking about the lab on the second date ! I 'm in love with you , Alec ! It stopped being an assignment a long time ago ! He bought a lot , but he couldn 't buy that . Who is he ? Why would you do this ? ! Hey , I got crackers ! Guys ? Here . Oh , come on ! You gotta put that thing away , they can find us with that ! Who can find us ? The freelancers ! They 'd kill for that thing ! They 've done worse for less , believe me . I got through it , I 'm here now , but I mean ... Can these , what 'd you call them ... freelancers , really find us through that ? Yeah , it 's like sending up a smoke signal ! Is there another exit ? Now see , she 's smart . She knows how dangerous they are . Call the last number ! Back the hell away ! She 's working for Escher . She 's been lying to you about who she is from day one . I know . Then you can 't trust her . Ladies , dude ! Try to keep this a weapons-free zone ! That whole thing about leaving the country ... Escher threatened me . Said if I grabbed that sphere for him he 'd let me off the hook . Let me be with you for real . I still want that . Whose number was it ? Escher 's . Whatever else he is , he doesn 't want you hurt . I know that for a fact . He 's dangerous , and he 's a liar ! How did Travis get into the lab ? Kellog . Why ? He set Travis up with that suit to take care of his Escher problem . You have the device . What is with that thing ? That is truly none of your business . It 's a time travel device . It 's how Kiera got here from the future . Alec ! Her , Jason , all the Liber8 terrorists ... Escher for all we know . No , not exactly . Time travel . Are you serious ? Yes . And Escher wants it . So if we destroy it , then Escher has no reason to pursue us ! Alec , no ! You can 't do this ! It has caused nothing but violence ever since it arrived . I 'm sorry Kiera , but there 's no other option . You know what that means to me ! Kiera , you need to understand what it means to me ! Just send me back . Before Liber8 arrived . I can prevent all of this from happening ! I told you , I don 't know if it 's gonna work . Guns down . Now ! I 'm not going back ! Acquire the targets . The rest are expendable . Hand it over . Alec ! [ Gunshots ] [ Fighting ] [ Gunshots ] [ Fighting ] [ Gunshots ] [ Fighting ] [ Gunshots ] Go ! [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] We have to go ! Alec ! Go with Kiera ! [ Gunshots ] Go , go , go ! Come on ! [ Gunshots ] Run ! Run ! Go ! [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] [ Gunshots ] Look out ! Get down ! Get off the roof . [ Gunshots ] Come on ! [ Gunshots ] We have to get off this roof !

No , no ! Don 't be sorry ! Just hold on , Emily , please ! Just hold on ! I told you the truth . You did . We both did . He can 't take that , that 's ours . Emily ! Emily ! Emily !

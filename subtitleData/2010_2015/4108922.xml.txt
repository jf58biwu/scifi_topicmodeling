 ( PEOPLE chattering ) ( MAN GRUNTlNG ) Hey , are you gooks almost done ? Faggot . ( ALL laughing ) - You are big motherfucker , yes ? - Yeah . ( screaming ) ( ALL clamouring ) ( whistle blowing ) ( siren sounding ) Just moments ago , a full-scale riot broke out at Terminal Island Penitentiary . As far as I can tell , there has been no action taken by Terminal Island Prison correction officers . Lock down the bridge , keep the tower guards . I want everyone else down here now . ( whistle blowing ) Yeah , yeah , yeah ! ( GRUNTlNG ) Of course I 'm serious ! Patch me live right fucking now ! Either you take me live or I tell your wife everything . ( screaming ) You got that , right ? What a shit match . I would never have bet if I knew Spiro was injured . - But you did , huh ? - Yeah . Take your winnings . The whole world 's falling apart , and Manchester United with it . When I came over here , that clip was the first thing I ever bought with my own money , you know ? So , you take care of it . You look after it . Look at you , profiting off football . He 's never watched a match in his life . That 's ' cause it 's fucking boring , that 's why . The world 's greatest game . I think it 's the third world 's greatest game , right ? ( LAUGHS ) What the fuck are you laughing at ? Excuse us , please . About the bank , it 's important to me . I know it is . That 's why I want to handle it my way , with my guys . Well , Vinnie brought me this score . My stipulation is that you 're in charge , which is the way I want it . - Can I count on you ? - What do you think ? Yeah . I know Vinnie and his boys are a bit green , but what my nephew lacks in experience , he makes up for with enthusiasm . Exactly what I 'm worried about . ( MARKUS LAUGHS ) Look , he fucks up , Mr. Kane , he answers to me , okay ? It 's going to be all right , Luke . Trust me . Always do . I know you do . Come on. I 've got something to show you . What do you think ? This is for me ? - You don 't like it ? - l think it 's beautiful . I just think , maybe , you know , based on the kind of work I do , you don 't think it 's a bit orange ? - You don 't fucking like it . - Are you kidding me ? She 's stunning . I just wonder , you think I might stand out in this thing ? No , the more obvious you are , the less suspicious you appear . So , like , hiding in plain sight kind of thing . Precisely . ( BOTH chuckling ) Okay . Don 't fuck it up . ( laughing ) ( indistinct chattering ) Thank you both for coming . PARKS : Mr. Weyland , I 'm not exactly sure why she 's here , but I know why I am , sir. I 've failed you and I 've disgraced the corporation . WEYLAND : Relax . I 'm surprised those animals don 't kill each other with more regularity . You 're both here because this incident has created a public relations nightmare for me . ( CHUCKLES ) Was something I said funny ? Well , you had a 48 share . Your network 's previous high was a seven . What you call a nightmare I 'd call a wet dream . Mr. Weyland , I know that the network isn 't your prime moneymaker . But I can 't believe that you don 't realise what a gold mine you 're sitting on . Humour me , Miss Jones . People are tired of fake violence and fights staged by Vegas promoters . The hatred that your inmates have is pure . Can 't be duplicated . ( LAUGHS ) You 're calling what happened today entertainment ? Ah ! What exactly do you have in mind ? vinnie : No , seriously , I gotta tell you , this motherfucker 's never carried a gun in 20 years working for my uncle . - That right , Luke ? - LUKE : Vinnie , pay attention . You got 60 seconds . You get in , you get out . - No one gets hurt . - We know . Don 't worry . ( engine running ) ( siren sounding ) ( CHATTERlNG ON police radio ) LUKE : We got company .

You 're going to get us fucking killed , like Terry . The only motherfucker that got Terry killed was you . Fucking relax ! ( SlRENS blaring ) We 're gonna blast our way through . No one 's getting blasted , you fucking understand me ? They 're gaining on us . Luke , fuck , I ain 't getting pinched . What the fuck are you doing ? What the fuck are you doing ?

MAN : The DA 's gonna pull his offer , Luke . Kane 'll walk away scot-free , and you 'll go away for life . LUKE : You see , I 'm not gonna testify against Markus Kane . Not for immunity , not for money , not for anything . We have some good news , Mr. Kane . We found Luke . - He 's on the island . - That is good news . ( LAUGHS ) Always knew I could trust that guy . I told you . No way would he betray me . Have him taken out . You 're joking , right ? So far , he hasn 't played ball with the feds . He 's in for life . What happens after a month of hard time , eh ? After a couple of them African apes have a go at him . How long do you think he 's gonna stay loyal then ? You know , it 's a shame , 'cause I love that guy like a brother . Anything else ? No , sir . - What else do you want on this ? - lt 's perfect . - Yeah ? Here , then . - Thank you . ( indistinct screaming ) ( MEN CLAMOURlNG ) Fuck you ! The average Death Match fight garners a 50 share . It peaked two months ago at 62 , but has been on the decline since . The most dangerous fighter is Big Bill , with a death count of 1 9 , followed by 14K , - who , coincidentally , has 14 kills . - Great , man . Someone did their homework , right ? - ls that him ? - Yeah . lists : That 's September Jones . Former Miss Universe . Was stripped of her crown after allegations of a sexual relationship with all five judges . Went to work for Weyland Broadcasting as a weather girl , is now the host and executive producer of Death Match . She grew a ... You have a list pretty much ready to go on anything , don 't you ? ANNOUNCER : Live from Terminal Island , television 's most violent , most disturbing , and most watched programme in human history . Welcome to Death Match . Our first fighter , a murderer serving four consecutive life sentences , Xander Grady ! ANNOUNCER : Xander , 1 1 kills , one submission . 6 ' 4 " , 220 pounds . His opponent , leader of the Terminal Island Triads , he currently ranks second on the kill board , he was Interpol 's third most wanted until his arrest in Los Angeles last year , 14K ! ANNOUNCER : 14K one submission , 14 kills . 5 ' 1 1 " , 1 59 pounds . The combatants are picked by lottery randomly each week . There are two ways to win . Kill your opponent , or make him submit . ANNOUNCER : There are several pressure plates that , when activated , can give a fighter access to a variety of weapons . But they only have 10 seconds to access them . If no fighter has won , both fighters are killed . ANNOUNCER : Dim the lights . The carnage is about to begin . You 're number one ! Yo , baby , you 're my number one ! ( BELL rings ) Chinese bastard ! ( screaming ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) ( BEEPlNG ) ( siren sounding ) Something 's not right . What 're you talking about ? Die !

( screaming ) - He quit ! - No ! Another fucking submission ! He quit ! - 14K ! 14K ! - ANNOUNCER : Tonight 's winner , 14K ! ( CROWD cheering ) Death Match is a trademark of Weyland International . Fighters are convicted violent felons . Acts should not be duplicated at home . Exactly what the fuck do you think you are doing ? You are done . Done ! Lights out ! Hey , baby .

Yes , I 'm sure . Now , you make my motherfucking money . You understand me ? lists : It 's a strict Triad code . Whoever spills the blood of a Triad , they 're sworn to take that person 's life . Xander killed a Triad last match . It defies logic why he wouldn 't kill him if he had the chance . Hey , kid , I 'm not looking for a best friend , okay ? So , just leave me alone . GOLDBERG : Carl Lucas . ( LAUGHS ) - Chill . Chill , man . - GOLDBERG : Relax . You 've been assigned to our work detail . That 's Rocco , I 'm Goldberg . - Goldberg , huh ? - Yeah . What are you , like , the ... You , like , the last Mexican Jew , or what ? ( LAUGHS ) Yeah. I killed all the rest . Okay . So , this work detail , what are we looking at ? And don 't tell me we 're washing underwear . - ROCCO : No . - l don 't care what you 're into . I 'm not washing anybody 's underwear . ( ALL chuckling ) On your feet , Lucas . Warden wants you . That 'll be all . Carl Lucas , arrested 22 times over a span of 20 years . But nothing ever stuck , not a single damn one . You just slipped through the cracks . Well , I shot a cop . Those cracks , they fill up pretty fast . They sure do . Yeah . Now , at first I didn 't realise who you were . Really ? So , who am I ? Well , an idiot , and soon a dead man . DA offers you a talk-and-walk , and you turn him down ? is that why you got me here ? No , it 's not. I 'm here to warn you . - Save your breath . - Oh , don 't get smart with me . I don 't know how many others know who you are , but when the word gets out , the killers are gonna be coming out of the woodwork . is that right ? ( BUZZES lNTERCOM ) And mark my words , Markus Kane will not show you the same type of loyalty that you 've shown him . GOLDBERG : Look , 14K kills Xander , he makes him a martyr . That 's like an honour . Xander quits , shames himself and the entire brotherhood . That makes him like a pussy . You got him , guys ? Yeah . Oh , man . I got a question . All these cars , man , it 's not exactly prison norm . What 's the deal ? Hey , Terminal Island is not about rehabilitation . You know what I mean ? It 's a business . All these cars , we melt them down , make weapons , guns , shells . If it kills , we make it . Hey , are you telling me the government 's paying top dollar for this recycled shit ? Top dollar ? Who said anything about top dollar ? Weyland International sells this stuff dirt-cheap . Yeah , when you 're not paying for labour , your prices can afford to be a little lower , you know what I mean ? GOLDBERG : They 're making money off our blood . - What do you know about these wheels ? - A little bit . - How does she run ? - Why don 't you see what she 's got ? - ( LAUGHS ) For real ? - For real . Why not ? ( TYRES screeching ) ( whooping ) GOLDBERG : Someone 's been driving a getaway car ! God damn , you put some magic in this thing . - How does she handle ? - Just the way she 's supposed to . Who was driving that car ? - What car ? - What car ? Hey , Luke , you a fighter ? I got no reason to fight anyone . Hey , reasons don 't mean shit in this place . The Calendar 's always looking for new blood , and you look like just her type . ( LAUGHS ) LUKE : Good to know . Some advice , blend in . Don 't give her no reason to fixate on you . LUKE : Hey , Goldberg , I 'm the last guy looking for a fucking spotlight . - Hey ! - Hey ! officer : Stay back ! Stay back ! Everybody else stay back ! I don 't want you in there . Move back . All of you , stay back ! Let 's go ! Move back ! ( screaming ) ( indistinct ) ( yelling ) - What 's going on here ? - Big guy tripped . - That so , Bill ? - Yeah , I tripped . That 's what he says . All right , let 's go ! Keep it moving ! GUARD 1 : Come on , move ! GUARD 2 : Get moving ! Move ! Move ! ROCCO : Who 's the little guy ? - His name 's Lists . - Lists ? You 'll work it out . ( SEPTEMBER sighs ) You ever hear of a computer ? You 're , like , a century behind everyone . I 'm surprised I don 't find an abacus in here . - What are you doing in my office ? - l 'm here for him . Carl Lucas . Even the name gives me a hard-on . The judge called him a monster at his trial . He 's perfect . - l can sell him . - You can 't have him . - l wasn 't asking your permission . - Wait . There 's more to it . DA thinks there 's a chance that he could turn state witness against Markus Kane . Now , you put him on your TV show , not only could those animals kill him , but basically , he just advertises to Kane where the chief witness against him sleeps , and then he 's a dead man . Mr. Lucas ' problem , not mine . Warden Parks , you and your prison exist for one reason , to facilitate Death Match . And here I thought we were here to protect society and punish criminals . Then you 're dumber than I thought . ( inaudible ) ( GRUNTlNG ) SEPTEMBER : Give us a minute . Would you like a towel ? I 'm fine . Yeah , I 'll say . Very impressive . And your fight with Big Bill yesterday , also impressive . - l don 't think we 've met. I 'm ... - Yeah , I know who you are . Save the sales pitch , huh ? I 'm not fighting . If I want you to fight , you fight . - ls that right ? - Yes . I can 't do anything about the life sentences , but you participate , and I will make your life here much more tolerable . Your own cell , no work detail , real food , as well as plenty of ( breathing heavily ) - perks . - Okay . So , I ... I win some fights for you , you need another guy to beat me . I mean , that 's ... That 's how it works , right ? Yeah . Okay . Hey , go sell sleazy someplace else , 'cause I ain 't buying . - You won 't leave me any choice . - Do what you gotta do . I 'm not gonna be a part of your freak show . We 'll see . Hey . You don 't hear the word " no " so often , do you ? Only when I say it . ANNOUNCER : Dim the lights , the carnage is about to begin .

Relax . ( LUKE groaning ) Any closer , buddy ... You 're really lucky , or this would have hit the femoral artery . - Yeah , that 's me . Lucky . - Yeah . You can say that . - LUKE : ( GROANS ) Man ! - Just relax . Relax . It 's a minor setback . A few rapists and murderers died . Boo-hoo . No . This is the end . You messed it up by pulling the plug . We would 've won the night . ( CHUCKLES ) You 're not good enough in bed to win this one . Sweet dreams . ( sighs ) officer : Come on , over here . Fuck . officer : Sit down there and shut up . - officer : Quiet down . - Hey . What happened ? You 're not the only one that got in some good shots . - l know . - WOMAN : All right , ladies ! Line it up ! The bus is leaving . Don 't make me tell you twice ! - Hey . - officer : Let 's go . - Thanks , huh ? - officer : Step through , ladies ! Yeah. I don 't know why I did it . Probably get thrown in the hole for that . Then why ? Why did you help that con ? Wasn 't gonna let the man fight my fight . officer : Right this way . Let 's go . You got a name ? Uh-huh . Yeah . Of course I do . ( KATRlNA laughing ) Come on , man . MAN : There he is . How the fuck is he still alive ? JOEY : Boss , we 've been assured it 's happening . It 's been happening for weeks now . How much longer do you think he 's gonna stay silent ? He 's a tough guy , and he 's been loyal ... I want him dead ! We have someone on the inside , a total psycho . - lt won 't take long now . - Joey . Joey . The box , with its implications of rigidity and squareness , symbolises unimaginative thinking and painful frustration . MARKUS : Sometimes we just have to step back , see if the solutions to our problem lies outside the box . Call a meeting . - With who ? - Everyone ! - You didn 't return my calls . - l don 't return a lot of calls . I wanna discuss Death Match . I think that we should pull the plug . When a real-life riot doesn 't generate a second-hour boost , - l 'd say it 's time to cut your loss . - Exactly . We need to evolve . We 've developed a strong base , we have legitimate TV stars ... The board 's decision is final , Miss Jones . In the past six months , I 'm the only profitable thing about this company . Unless you want a sexual harassment suit crammed down your throat , you will listen to what I have to say . Fine . 9 : 00 a.m. tomorrow . MARKUS : I 'm troubled . What seemed to be a very simple task has taken the most perplexing of turns . So I 'm gonna speak slowly , clearly , so my message is not lost , or ignored , or misinterpreted . One million dollars to the man who kills Carl Lucas . This offer expires in 48 hours , and if that happens , I will consider you all enemies , and I will bring war on your fucking head . Understand ? SEPTEMBER : Ninety percent of Terminal Island , your grand investment , is dead space . Death Match merely stayed your execution . If you wanna get a breath of fresh air , you need a bold initiative . I propose a race . Wicked . Epic . Something like no one has ever seen before . The track will run the length of Terminal Island along some of the narrowest and most harrowing paths that the racing world has to offer . The best part of it , everything that we need is right in our own backyard . We 're gonna modify each vehicle , adding reinforced steel plating , bulletproof glass , and roll cages to at least give the drivers a fighting chance . We 'll take everything that made Death Match a hit , combine it with everything we have at our disposal . Such as ? Heavy fucking artillery . ( exclaims ) SEPTEMBER : Every car will hold as many guns and as much ammunition as it can . ( laughing ) So , you 're going to arm the prisoners . Precautions will be made to make sure they can only shoot at people on the track . Nine cars , three days , 20,000 rounds of ammunition . Going from fighting to racing , that 's a big leap . We need a hook . Something that incorporates the two better . Now , in a game show , no one cares about the game . The game 's arbitrary . People care about the risk and the money . Now , we 've been concentrating on the game , not the risk . That 's why our audience is bored . Let 's concentrate on the prize . A prize more valuable than money . Okay . What 's more valuable than money ? Life is a more valuable prize than money . In our deal with the state , we control sentencing . That means we control their life . So if a prisoner wins five races , he gets his freedom . No matter what he 's in for , robbery , rape , homicide , whatever , he wins his freedom . He wins his life . You have life , freedom . Stop . Death Race . LUKE : You know what ? That 's fucking bullshit , Rocco . Well , how do you know , man ? Maybe it 's for real . Are you kidding me ? You think they 're gonna let murderers and rapists out of this place , ever ? Hey , Luke 's right . And besides that , homes , you don 't drive worth a shit . ROCCO : You know what ? Fucking blow me . ( big bill laughing ) Fucking faggot . That would be the only chance I have of getting out . And what would you do , Lists , if you got out ? Start over . ANNOUNCER : Welcome to Death Race . Terminal Island Penitentiary hosts three days of the ultimate in auto carnage . Day one of the race begins in 10 minutes , and will be brought to you without commercial interruption by Weyland International . Your safety is our top priority . Get ready .

( laughing ) Okay , what did I do ? You won ! To the victor belongs the spoils . Okay , so what does that mean ? What is this ? In ancient Rome , the winning gladiator was the recipient of gifts . A show of gratitude from the powers that be for a job well done . She 's yours . Mmm-hmm . Do with her what you please . ( LAUGHS ) ls that right ? And who the fuck are you ? I 'm Caesar . You know , they 're probably watching . Mmm-hmm . Listening , too , I guess . Some kind of game they 're playing . Yeah , probably betting on what we 'll do next . Option A , they 're trying to get us closer so they can use one of us against the other . Uh-huh . Option B being , maybe , put a wedge between us , so we fuck up on the track ? I guess we do what they want , and leave the bullshit for later . You playing me ? Does it matter ? No . ( giggles ) ( GRUNTlNG ) ( panting ) Kane put a million-dollar bounty on Lucas , and all the bangers are going for it . Put Mr. Lucas in solitary . I thought this was a prison thing , but this is too big for even the guards to resist . - You still gonna let him race ? - Oh , yeah . They 're free to kill him on the track , just not off camera . What about him ? Wait ! Wait ! Come on . Let 's go . You had your fun . Move . - katrina : Where are we going ? - Shut up . katrina : What the fuck is this ?

And in return , I offer you freedom . A chance of life outside these walls for one simple task . You 've got 48 hours . You kill him or I kill you . Let me make these walls disappear .

Thankfully all his vitals have stabilised , but he should be moved to a facility more suited to his needs . SEPTEMBER : Out ofthe question . Doctor , someone from the outside tried to kill him . Unless they think he 's dead , they 'll come back to finish the job . Yeah , well , I can 't pronounce a man dead while he 's still alive . Can 't you ? ( monitor FLATLlNlNG ) WEYLAND : How are we doing with finding a replacement for Parks ? She comes highly recommended from Halliburton . She ran their maximum security detention centre . She 's strong . She 's smart . Ruthlessly ambitious . I think if I weren 't around , she 'd tell people that Death Race was her idea and she 'd convince them that it was . How 's the switchover to the Internet ? Transition 's complete . We start streaming live worldwide tomorrow . The numbers have already surpassed pay-per-view , thanks to the Frankenstein commercial . Hold on . Wait . I 've been meaning to talk to you about this Frankenstein . Did you make him up ? Frankenstein most certainly exists , and he will be in the race tomorrow . He better be . And he better come as good as advertised . DOCTOR : The procedure 's experimental and dangerous . We 're talking about placing electrodes into the brain . SEPTEMBER : You told me he was a perfect candidate . DOCTOR : Oh , he is . But there are no guarantees . SEPTEMBER : Let 's wake him up . DOCTOR : Mr. Lucas . You 've got second-degree burns over 85 % of your body . Now , you 're lucky that you suffered no significant injuries . Not a broken bone or damaged organ , which is remarkable considering the intensity of the fire . LUKE : So , this is hell ? SEPTEMBER : Why ? LUKE : Where else would you be ? SEPTEMBER : You do rememberme . You win five races and you 're free . LUKE : You 're out of your fucking mind . SEPTEMBER : No more Markus Kane trying to track you down . Like a second chance . Look at me . Really . Look at me . What kind of second chance would I have ? SEPTEMBER : You 're either Frankenstein or you 're nobody . You 're certainly not Carl Lucas any more . The entire world watched him incinerate . There 's even a death certificate . LUKE : I pityyou . SEPTEMBER : Okay . If you don 't do it for your life , then you do it for Katrina . I 'll furlough five of my worst sodomites for a play date with sweet Katrina . By the time they 're finished with her , she 'll be lucky if she has a pulse . How do you feel , Mr. Lucas ? The name is Frankenstein . ( CAR engine revving ) Sorry to disappoint you . You 're gonna have to settle for the Mexican Jew . Three , two , one , and we 're in . Good evening , and welcome to Death Race . We 're streaming live worldwide for over 20 million viewers . This week ... Yada , yada , yada .

WEYLAND : Move my tee-off time from 9 : 00 to 1 0 : 00 . You see that ? That 's a stupid bitch . Take care of your business ? I 'm only sorry Luke didn 't live to see this . I 'm not so sure he didn 't . Frankenstein , huh ? You got a real name ? Uh-huh . Yeah , of course , I do .

 Previously on warehouse 13 ... Apparently Martino and your partner were having an affair , and he was married . I read the press release of what went down in Denver . Lives were saved . Lives were lost . Hey , Bunny . You 're dead , Sam . I was late . No , Bunny . I was early . Myka , the only person responsible for Sam 's death is the piece of garbage that pulled the trigger that day . Security , 11 : 00 . [ Train horn blares ] Copy that , Chloe . [ Whistles ] And clear . Okay , listen , be ready , 'cause he 's gonna loop around again in 12 minutes . I 'll only need four . Well , Artie was right . The plaque was just covering up a hole with a bunch of junk in it . Civic buildings used to honor their workers by burying their tools . Yeah , well , I bet they 'd have preferred a proper wage for tunneling through the Rockies with a pickaxe . Do you see the spike ? There 's a bunch of them in here . Pete , wait . Pfft . What ? No glove , no love , man . What would I do without my super-cautious partner ? [ Chuckles ] Can 't be . Oh , my God . Sam ? Sam , wait ! [ Gunshots ] Sam ! Pete , are you gonna be okay ? I have to go check on something . I 'm good . Go . [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Groans ] Oh , sorry . [ Electric zap ] Ah ! Myka , one of the spikes cut my glove . I almost got him . I- - [ choking ] Myka , something 's happening . Myka , help me . [ Groaning ] Pete ! Pete , what 's happening ? Talk to me ? [ Groaning , choking ] [ Electrical zapping ] [ Coughing ] Are you okay ? [ Coughs ] It 's like having breakfast with my Aunt Jude and Uncle Pall Mall . [ Coughs ] Are you okay ? I almost had him , Pete . What ? Had who ? Leo . Who 's Leo ? The guy who shot my partner . He 's the guy who killed Sam . [ Adventurous music ] ♪ Warehouse 13 3x07 ♪ Past Imperfect Original Air Date on August 22 , 2011 = = sync , corrected by elderman = = [ Horse neighs , chicken clucks ] I just can 't get over it . Handsome boy like you not married . He 's very picky . The collection 's over here . So what made your great Uncle collect doorknobs ? O.C.D. Back then we didn 't have Prozac , so we just called it a hobby and looked the other way . Well , one of these doorknobs might be worth something now . Fingers crossed . Now , I checked my TV Times . I couldn 't find anything called The Artifact Roadshow . Mrs. Hodgson , can I bother you for a glass of something cold ? Where 's my head today ? I made iced tea and left it downstairs . I 'll go get it . I 'll get my niece 's email address . She 's single too . [ Chuckles ] Okay . [ Laughs ] What do you bet great-Uncle doorknob never got married either ? Yeah . One of these things is not like the other . I don 't suppose it 'll just say " Triangle Shirtwaist Factory " on it . Yeah , 146 women die in a sweatshop fire . That 's a hell of a way to create an artifact . Yeah , they were locked in so they couldn 't leave work early . As they tried to escape , the doorknob absorbed their pain and suffering . Did Artie give you an actual physical description ? Doorknob . Right . Guess we just dump all these out , drop ' em each in a bag , and see which one- - Ahh ! Oh , is everything okay ? [ Sizzling ] Much better now . Thank you . - Is that peach ? - Thank you . But I was wearing purple gloves . Yeah , see , the thing is artifact snagging is not an exact science . So can I drive the Prius back ? Please , please , please . Thanks . You might consider buying one of your own . As soon as I can get Artie to quit paying me in bright orange $ 500 bills . Okay ? Hey , cute . Oh . What a sweetheart . Where 'd you come from ? Hmm , she doesn 't have a dog . [ Dart zings ] Agh . Steve ? Ah . [ Dog barks ] Three years ago , Leo Bock stole plates from the Denver Mint . Later as we were setting a trap for him he gunned down Sam in the National Building . But I know that I saw him today . Here you go . I 've cued it up to 9 : 00 a.m. Come on , Leo . Show your face . We should check credit card purchases for trains arriving around 9 : 00 . No , no , Leo 's a master counterfeiter . He tosses off identities the way that a cook breaks eggs . There . That 's him . What camera is that ? The northeast exit . Pete , let 's go . So he left 20 minutes ago . He--he took a taxi . Or no , a bus . Where does that leave us ? Look , Myka , he came to Denver for a reason . We 'll track him down . I chased Leo harder than I 've ever chased anyone , okay ? I studied him . I knew everything about him . He drinks gin and tonics with two limes , he bats lefty , he has no gallbladder , and he has a dairy allergy . None of it paid off . And now he 's gone again . I think we should contact Denver Secret Service . My old team ? Yeah , well , it 's their case , right ? You know , I haven 't been in touch with them since I transferred to D.C. And then Mrs. Frederic asked me to join the warehouse . Right , where you 've been saving the world over and over and over again . But I couldn 't save Sam , and I couldn 't catch Leo . And if I were my team , I 'd have a hard time forgiving me . [ Dog barks ] [ Barking ] Hey . Claudia , hey , wake up . Jinksy ? Oh , God , what the hell happened ? This time we got snagged and tagged . And de-bagged . The doorknob is gone . Somebody must have followed us . Hey , wait a minute . I saw a car . What kind ? It was silvery bluey . Ugh , that 's all I got . Looks like they drove closer . These tracks are fresh . I 'll call Artie . [ Dog barks ] Shh , you ! You called me . Artie , somebody knocked us out , grabbed the doorknob , and zoomed off in a car . Code red or blue , whatever the worst color would be . All right , take a deep breath . Were there any witnesses ? Not in the middle-of-nowhere Wisconsin . [ Dog barks ] Hey , hey , hey . Easy , fella . Was the dog there when you were attacked ? Oh , you think the dog did it ? Don 't be absurd , but what do dogs do when a car zooms off ? They chase them ? Yes , and what do cars have on their back bumpers ? License plates . So maybe the dog saw the license plate and he can tell us--and that 's where this all falls apart . Just come back and bring the dog . [ Farnsworth powers down ] Oh , and I 'm being absurd ? Ah . [ Indistinct chatter ] Here . Let me . So you 're going in early today . Yeah , well , I think it 's best if we don 't show up together . Why , you think people know ? Do- - we work with agents trained to detect minute behavioral cues . So do I think that our coworkers notice that every time I look at you I want you in every way imaginable ? Yeah , I think they know . Sorry . Don 't apologize . I like that look . There it is now . Oh , you 're killing me . Good . I have to go to work . So do you . All work and no play ... Stay focused , Slim . Eyes and ears open . He was really young , huh ? Last guy you thought would fall . He was an impeccable Agent , and his backup plans had backup plans . You know , Pete , before we go in there , I 've got to tell you something . I think I already know . That FBI Agent Bonnie Belski told me that Sam was married when you guys were together . Well , obviously Belski didn 't know the whole story . Sam had been separated from his wife for a year before we even- - - Myka Bering . - Zach . Couldn 't believe it when I heard you were coming in . How are you ? Good , good . God , it 's nice to see you . How 's South Dakota Secret Service treating you ? And what the hell is there to do in South Dakota ? Well , hey , now , you 'd be surprised . Guarding those Mount Rushmore Presidents , a lot more challenging than you 'd think . This is my partner , Pete Lattimer . This is Zach . He 's an investigator here in Denver . Actually , I 'm director of investigations now . Really ? That was gonna be- - Sam 's job , I know . I try to live up to his standards . Well , come on back . - Congratulations . - Thank you . Thank you so much . I appreciate it . So Leo came by train ? And changed his appearance . He shaved his facial hair and shot filler into his chin . But if you look at these eight focal points , there 's a 97 % match to Leo Bock . Okay , so I guess the real question here is why is Leo back in Denver ? Some murders get off on returning to the scene of the crime . Well , it doesn 't fit Leo 's profile . He 's white-collar all the way . His only violent crime was killing Sam . And this is the first time I 've seen him not wearing a suit . He could be going back to the mint , right ? Three years later , new Secretary of Treasury . Maybe he needs a new set of plates . Well , you just can 't walk into the mint . Wait . Yes , you can . Yes , you can . Look at what Leo 's wearing . The mile high city T-shirt , the Rocky Mountain football cap , the jeans . I mean , guys , come on , who dresses that way ? - Tourists ! - Right . Okay , that 's why he 's not wearing a suit . Because he 's trying to blend in with the others . By taking a bus tour of downtown Denver . Okay , the first bus leaves from the northeast corner of the train station at 9 : 10 a.m. First stop is the state capitol , second stop is the art museum , and the third stop is ... the U.S. mint . Bus arrives in 20 minutes . Can we make it in time ? It 's a block away . Well , I 'm not from Denver , now am I ? [ Chuckles ] Okay , so the last thing that I want is a hostage situation . So wait until Leo gets off the bus before we grab him . I 'll back you up from the east . Zach , you got the west . Here it comes . Okay , boys , just follow my lead . Eyes and ears open . Still impulsive and emotional . - Classic Myka . - What , classic who now ? Hey , whoa- - You okay ? I will be when we catch this bastard . You 'll need it for the mint . And as you can see , you 're gonna get a taste of our famous Denver weather . Nice one second , rain the next . All right , let 's go . Pete , he 's made us . Police , freeze ! Oh , my God , he 's got a gun ! [ Screaming ] Secret Service ! Move ! [ People shouting ] Look out , look out ! Police ! - Pete , there ! - Look out ! Jim , he 's coming your way . I 'm okay . Damn it ! What happened ? Where 's Leo ? Well , he came down this alley . And then he just disappeared . He did it again . You let him get away ? How could you ? How did you let that happen ? Hang in there , man . Jim 's got a hairline rib fracture . The EMT says he 'll be fine . Look , I know how frustrated you must be , but don 't take it out on Pete , okay ? We all want to put this guy away . Thanks . I 'm--I 'm gonna--yeah . [ Indistinct ] Pete , what are you doing ? Well , I 'm--I 'm thinking like Myka . Yeah , I mean , when something doesn 't make sense , Myka tries to make sense of it . I mean , but not right now because she 's too emotional , which is where Pete usually is , emotional . But then I thought , hey , while you 're being me I might as well be you . So I 've investigated every way that Leo could have used to escape a blind alley , right ? Like hidden drain pipes or manholes . And ? Nothing , but then I thought , what if Leo was able to jump into the bed of the truck onto the roof and up and over the wall ? Well , that 's quite a maneuver . He had 50 yards on me , right ? Which is about a seven-second lead . So how long does it take to get over the wall ? Well , that 's what I was trying out , but I could use some help . Okay . [ Laughs ] All right , all right , all right . - Okay , first ... - Yes ? We must synchronize our watches to the exact second . Okay , yeah . Ready and go . [ Beeping ] Yeah . Then we 'll walk over here to where I last saw Leo . Uh-huh . At the top of the next minute , I 'll run . Seven seconds later , you 'll go . - Got it , I 'll be you . - Exactly . Go . Six , five ... Time . Okay , okay . Let 's try 12 seconds . Time . Time . Time . Time . See ? It 's impossible . So there 's no explanation of how he got away ? This is what I 'm saying . Okay , look , when something has no explanation- - oh , my God . What ? Well , don 't you get it ? Good , you 're back to being Myka . Now I shall go back to being Pete . When something has no explanation , there can only be one explanation . Leo has an artifact ? That 's the only thing that makes sense . I mean , he vanished into thin air . We know that they 're out there , right ? That we do . But I didn 't know that three years ago . So I didn 't know what I was looking for . Okay , you know what , I 'm gonna go back to Sam 's office . I 'm gonna look at his notes on the old case . What , are you gonna re-open it ? Yes . But not as a Secret Service Agent . As a Warehouse Agent . Yes ! The old Myka is back ! Could be good , could be bad . - You coming ? - Yeah . Somewhere around- - yes ! Perfect . All right . Father and son Shriners . No , they belonged to a depression-era mindreading act , Mr. Mental and Coco . Real names Raymond Fraser and Coco . Yes , now in the act Coco would scamper into the audience and he would solicit items like a monogrammed handkerchief or a dollar bill , something with initials or numbers . Mr. Mental would sit onstage , he 'd be blindfolded , he would read Coco 's mind , he would recite back perfectly the numbers or the initials . So let me guess , the hats were imbued with the mystical juju of- - No , not this time , because Mr. Mental was an amateur inventor and he had a background in neurology . Look . A transmitter . So the receiver would be- - Yes . Huh , so he used radio waves ? Not quite . Brain waves . Magnetic resonance . Impressive . Mr. Mental made the first MRI . There also may have been the teensiest amount of mystical juju . Wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that he could actually read Coco 's thoughts ? Well , nothing too complex , but simple images came through loud and clear , yes . And we 're gonna use these to get the license plate from the dog ? With any luck . But there 's always a downside , right ? What 's the downside ? Not that bad . Uh , a little help with the fezzes ? Okay . Hey , slim . Free for dinner tonight ? Well , that depends on who 's asking . Ah , nobody special . Got something for you . Can 't show you here , but it 's a game changer . A man of mystery . I like that . Sam , we just got an anonymous tip . Leo is gonna be in the lobby of the National Building at 4 : 00 . About time we caught a break . You want to take Jim for backup ? No , I 'll take Myka . She 's got great eyes . Okay , I 'll take Jim . Come on , we 'll coordinate with local . Hey , I 'll see you , Slim . Don 't be late . Lookin ' through the old case , huh ? Yeah . Find anything ? So far no luck . Jim , you and Sam were close , right ? Well , not as close as you two , but yeah . The night Sam died , he was gonna give me something . It was a card or an envelope . Any guess what was in it ? No idea . Although he did say something about him wanting you to move in with him . Maybe it was a key ? A key ? And maybe I shoulda just left it at " no idea . " No , no , it 's fine . Besides , there 's no key in that box . Well , that 's just his office stuff . I mean , his personal stuff was sent to , uh ... To where ? It all went to Allison 's . Who 's Allison ? Sam 's wife . [ Exhales ] I could go in with you . Thanks . I need to do this alone . Okay . [ Knocks ] Myka ? What are you doing here ? Allison , hi . I 'm sorry to bother you . I need your help . It 's about Sam . Come in . Thank you . Guess we can talk in here . What 's going on ? I know that this sounds strange , but I 'm still tracking down Sam 's killer . Oh . The night that he died , Sam--Sam was gonna give me something . The service gave you a box of his personal effects . Can I--can I ask you what was in it ? Just office things . A change of clothes , keepsakes . Photo of him and me . A photo of him and you . I really hate to intrude like this . I know that this is very awkward . Myka , I was so angry . At you . Not that you had done anything wrong . We 'd split up long before , but you were proof that Sam had moved on . That was hard for me . I know . I used to give him grief that he always had to have a backup plan . Well , I think you were more to him than just a backup . And thank you for speaking to me . It was probably just a greeting card anyway . It wasn 't- - - A card ? Yeah . Wait . With everything that happened after , the funeral , I didn 't know where to send it . I guess I didn 't try very hard either . I 'm sorry . Thank you for giving it to me now . On one condition . Get this guy , Myka . Get him . Thank goodness she still had it . [ Soul music plays ] [ Music stops ] God , same knew that I hated that song . So what 's on it ? What did he write ? Nothing . Nothing . I mean , it 's another dead end . [ Cell phone rings ] Bering . [ Music plays ] ♪ Working at the car wash ♪ Yeah , copy that . We 'll be right there . Security detail , they just spotted Leo at the train station . We get another chance . Hey , guys . Thanks for calling . Where 's Leo ? He 's in the waiting area . We got a man out front playing janitor keeping an eye on him , and we got the other place locked down . Your mission , Myka . How do you wanna play it ? Straight up . No chase this time . We move in , weapons ready but hidden . You guys go right , I 'll go left . I 'll be on channel one . Pete , I need you to stay here . [ Chuckles ] Right . Wait . Myka , Myka , Myka . What--what ? Look , I know that I can 't make you stay here , but I can beg you to . Why ? No one has your back like I do . I know , it 's just ... Look , the last time I got a tip to nab Leo , my partner ended up ... I could never recover from that . [ Sighs ] All right , all right . This once , for you . But take him down , okay ? And fast . [ Exhales ] Hands where I can see them ! He 's got a gun ! [ Gunshot , woman screams ] - Myka ? - Clean here . I had to take the shot . He had a weapon out of nowhere . I know . Unit four , suspect down . Shots fired . He 's got no pulse . Myka ! What happened ? Leo pulled his gun , and Zach dropped him . So it 's over . That 's good , right ? We need to find that artifact . [ Indistinct chatter ] I bagged everything that I could get my hands on . Nothing reacted . Well , it makes sense . I mean , if he coulda , you know , teleported or whatever I guess he would have . Something feels wrong . Myka , I trust my vibes , right ? Well , trust your instincts . You 're the observant one . Observe . [ Sighs ] Pete . Look at how he 's holding his weapon . He bats lefty . It 's in his right hand . Right . Okay , so options ? Why would someone purposefully hold their gun in the wrong hand ? Uh ... He got tired of running and wanted to end it right here and now ? Suicide by cop . It 's not Leo . Besides , I saw his face . He was confused . He wasn 't determined . Okay , okay , so he 's sitting there , right ? You guys come up . He stands up to surrender and then ... Suddenly his gun was pointed at me . Now what do you mean suddenly ? Suddenly , suddenly . Like , in the blink of an eye . Okay , Myka , um , blink . I 'm still here , right ? Yes , Pete , you 're still here . What does that- - Now close your eyes and keep them closed . Close ' em . Okay , now open them . I disappeared , right ? No . You 're behind me . No , I know , just- - what if a blink lasted longer than a blink and we didn 't know it ? You think the artifact messes with time ? Show me your watch . We synchronized our watches in the alley , remember ? And now ? They 're out of synch . You were outside of the room when we went after Leo , and now my watch is- - is behind your watch by ... 47 seconds . That could only mean two things . Napoleon shared a first kiss with Josephine that lasted exactly that long . Yeah . Or ha ! Google schmoogle , I 'll stick with paper . The U.S.S. Eldridge . A 1940s warship that docked in the Philadelphia shipyards . Well , wait , wait , wait a minute . The Philadelphia Experiment , Artie ? Please , please , tell me that wasn 't a hoax . No , no , no , don 't get too excited . The Eldridge was the Navy 's attempt to use high-powered magnets and generators to create a cloaking device . It kinda worked . It did look like the ship was off the radar for 47 seconds . But really , it just froze the radar screen while the ship kept moving ? But the energy released from that temporal disturbance may have given birth to an artifact that recreates the effect . Right , but only over a limited area . 47 seconds . That 's more than enough time for Leo to make it over the alley wall . It 's also enough time for someone to freeze the team and put a gun into Leo 's wrong hand . Which suggests that whoever is holding the artifact can also move through the freeze . Leo wasn 't working alone . He 's got a partner . Or did until his partner set him up to take the fall today . Excuse me . If I may , good-bye . How could I have been so stupid ? All this time I 've been chasing Leo , and there 's been somebody else . All right , so now that we know that , we just have to go after him . Him ? Her ? I mean , literally , it could be anybody out there . Easy , easy , don 't you think you 're exaggerating just a little ? No , I don 't because this case just blew up . It blew up again . Myka . Myka ! Myka ! We 'll take it one step at a time , right ? We 'll start identifying suspects . No . You--you do it , okay ? Because I am out . Wait , what ? Pete ... For three years I have done nothing but fail on this case . I failed as a Secret Service Agent , I failed as a Warehouse Agent , and I failed as Sam 's partner . I was his backup , Pete . [ Dog panting ] Now it 's important you not make any sudden moves . If the hat gets knocked off , the receiver could pull in a massive amount of static . The downside . Yes . One night an audience member pulled off Coco 's fez and Raymond Fraser was never the same . Mr. Mental went mental ? Just keep the hat on the dog 's head . Claudia , you 're gonna write down the license plate numbers . As soon as you bark them out . [ Laughs ] I suppose you 've got several of those bon mots at the ready . More than 5 , less than 100 . - Hooray . - I 've got three . Just put our fezzes on our heads simultaneously please . Simultaneously . On our heads simultaneously , not- - [ electronic whoosh ] [ Both grunt ] [ Both bark ] This seems dangerous . Yeah . Someone could take a picture and post it on the Internet . - Three , eight , five ! - Whoa , halfway there . That stupid scarab ! [ Whimpers ] [ Barks ] Artie . Watch the hat ! Grab his tail , grab his tail . The hat ! Watch the hat ! Grab his tail ! Doggy , doggy , doggy , doggy , doggy , doggy . - Hey . - Hey . So you feelin ' any better after your little fit back there ? Not really , no . That 's a shame . It was a good one . You know , Myka , you only fail if you give up . I know . All right , so what would Sam say ? Stay focused , Slim . Eyes and ears open . [ Chuckles ] Don 't get emotional . Ah , well , there you go . He said it , not me . Don 't--don 't get emotional . I gotta tell you , it 's kinda the opposite of what you 're doing right now . Ears open . The card . Sam 's card . Where is it ? Where did it ? Right here , right here . Okay , he loved his backups , and he knew that I hated this song . [ Soul music plays ] If he was here right now , he would make me listen to it , right till the end , just to torture me . I love this guy . You said no one would connect me to the plates , but now this guy Sam is all over me . It 's Leo 's voice . So he 's good . That 's your problem . You 're on his team , talk to him , offer to cut him in . Game changer . That 's why Sam wanted to take me to dinner . He wanted to talk to me outside of the office . Boy scout , huh ? All right , I 'll take care of him . Use the thing . He 'll never see it coming . My God , the only other agents who were on that case with us were Zach and Jim . All right , so what are you thinking ? It 's time to do something impulsive . Hey , sweetie . Where are you , buddy ? Poochie ! Come on , boy . You wanna play ? Huh ? Here , doggy . This was cute for , like , a minute . Yeah , come on . Play fetch with your Uncle Steve . Here , doggy . Nice doggy . Hey , pooch ! Ringa-ding-ding . [ Sighs ] The things I do for Artie . Hey , any sign of the dog ? No , but I know how to make him come to us . [ Rings bell ] Pavlov 's bell . You know--whoa , that happened fast . What ? The downside . Getting a little slurpy . I 'll be fine tomorrow . Hey , boy , you still got your hat on . Good boy . What 's that in your mouth ? Who 's a good scarab killer ? You are . Yes , you are . Ah , uh ... Claude . Did I get it ? Uh , sure . Yeah . Yeah , you 're good to go . Come on , hey , let 's get you back to Artie . Come on . What 's going on ? You said it was urgent . You need to come with us to see Zach . And get some cuffs . Zach . Got your message . Kind of formal just for you to say good-bye . Actually , it 's you who 's saying good-bye , Zach . Yeah , we know everything , how you worked with Leo to get the plates . And when Sam got to close , you dropped him . All for a lousy promotion . What ? Myka , are you crazy ? You 're under arrest , Zach . Jim , what are they talking about ? I have no idea . We 've got the recording or Leo talking to you about killing Sam . Okay , that is ridiculous . I 'm done listening to this crap . Hey , stop right there . Zach , he 's got a gun ! The ship 's barometer . You know about it ? I know that you can stop time . And I know that you sent Sam into the National Building with a big target on his chest . Sam , wait ! When he picked you to back him up ... I 'll take Myka . She 's got great eyes . I knew he had his doubts about me . So you killed him ? [ Gunshot ] No , but I held you back long enough so Leo could . That 's why I was late . By 47 seconds . It 's happening again . I 'll take that . [ Gasps ] What the hell ? Oh , my God . Oh , my God , Jim . Myka . Myka , are you okay ? Myka , what happened ? Zach , I 'm so sorry . Look , Jim- - Jim was working with Leo , and Sam got in his way just like we were about to . Holy mother . In here ! He got shot . Hey , Myks . Is--is it over ? Yeah , it 's over . Do you feel better ? No . [ Sighs ] What 'd you tell the FBI ? That it all happened in the blink of an eye , Jim went bad , and Zach acted by the book . Did you give them the recording ? First I made a copy . You know , for backup . Ooh , Sam taught you well . When did you know it was Jim and not Zach ? Well , not until Jim pulled out the barometer . Uh-huh , uh-huh . So pretty much the last second . Risky sting operation . Impulsive , emotional . Classic Myka . You knew before I did , didn 't you ? Knew what ? Don 't play dumb with me , Lattimer . Who , me ? What you talkin ' bout , Willis ? Pete . All right , all right , maybe a little . I mean , I knew that Leo couldn 't have poofed out of that alley without a little help , and you weren 't being entirely rational . So I thought I needed to- - Gently walk me through it . Let me discover the proof so I 'd believe it . It was your case to solve , Agent Bering , and you did it . Thank you for ... You know , being so patient with me . It was a little trick I learned from my overly-cautious partner . Ah ! Myka . Allison . All right , I 'll see you outside . Okay . We got him . We finally got him . I heard . Zach called . Ah . Thank you . Um ... It 's for both of us . [ Sighs ] [ beeping ] [ Dog whimpers ] [ Inhales deeply ] Judging from the look on his face , something 's about to come out . Please let it be numbers and letters . Q , nine , three . Six digits , all I need . Oh , did you get it ? Yes , Claudia 's searching right now . Ah , yeah . That wasn 't so bad . Claudia- - Claudia , what the hell ? - Pavlov 's bell . Ooh , you know that causes excessive drooling for- - I got that . Thank you . Yeah . Oh , yeah . Yeah , I 've seen where that tongue has been . So what do we do with him now ? We take him back to Wisconsin ? Mrs. Hodgson says he 's a stray . Finders keepers . Which is good , because we couldn 't give him back . The psychic bond between us is just too strong . He owns me now . No , you mean that you own him . No , no , we don 't own dogs . Dogs own us . Cats are prisoners , but dogs own us . His name , by the way , is Trai . - Trai ? - Yeah , it 's short for trailer . Got a match . Our evil car belongs to a rental company . Surprise , surprise . Which would require a driver 's license . Can you get into the company 's computer ? Please . Does a cheese doodle ? Hello , gorgeous . Our doorknob stealer is rather perky in a roadside diner waitress kind of way . What the hell ? Artie . Oh , dear God . Sally Stukowski . Do we know her ? Worse . She knows us . = = sync , corrected by elderman = =

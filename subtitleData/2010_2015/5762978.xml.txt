 Twenty years ago , there was a fire in one of our labs and the original genome was destroyed . FELIX : These were Rachel 's parents . COSIMA : Susan and Ethan Duncan , they were geneticists . I love you , too , Daddy . What are you so scared for us to find out about Project LEDA ? I shot you ! You were dead ! Are you ready to tell us what really happened with Helena ? I 'm sick , Delphine . I 'm willing to disregard Rachel and proceed with the treatment . This was Daniel 's gun . What do you need me to do ? PAUL " . Felix will be charged with murder unless Rachel gets what she wants . You have until morning . More riddles from your sister . SARAH " . This matches the coordinates . BELL " . This is Maggie Chen 's locker . She must have used it as a drop for information for Helena . " Swan Man . " SARAH : Professor Ethan Duncan , alive . It 's vital my brother goes free . I can buy you three days . Only you can help me find Swan Man . Where are we going ? Cold River . What 's that ? A town ? A place of screams . ( SARAH GASPING ) You 've got an iron gut , haven 't you ? I only ate half . ( SIGHS ) No , thank you . You have to eat , Sarah . So , your Cold River , it 's not on the map , where is it ? That would spoil the surprise . Why don 't you just tell me where Duncan is ? We can take him to Leekie . If you knew where Swan Man was , you would leave me behind . Sestra ? Yeah ? If you have Kira and we are twins , could I have babies , too ? Why ? I 'm very good with children . You said the Proletheans did something to you . Something about married ? What happened ? I don 't know . I had a fever . Kira is lucky . Why is that ? You are a good mother . Mmm . I don 't really think so . There 's somebody here . What ? ( IMITAES BARKING ) Look , look ... - He likes you . - ( SARAH SCOFFS ) He likes you . ( KISSING SOUND ) - ( SLURPING ) - Ew , gross . Go to sleep , weirdo , we 've got an early start . Don 't let the bedbugs bite . - ( FARTING ) - ( LAUGHING ) Excuse me ! - SARAH : Piss off ! - ( CHUCKLING ) God , you act like you 've never been in a car before . Never been on road trip . Only told where to go and what to do . Just ... pick a station , please . ( SUGAR SUGAR BY THE ARCHIES PLAYING ) ♪ Sugar - ( MUSIC STOPS ) - Ugh . Not happening . - # Honey , honey - Oh , for ... ♪ You are my candy girl ( SINGING ALONG TO RADIO ) # And you 've got me wanting you Oh , this must have been a huge hit with the nuns in Ukraine . Yes . Super sunshine hit . # You are my candy girl # And you 've got me wanting you Are you going to sing the whole way ? # I just can 't believe the love ... # I just can 't believe it 's you - # Ah , honey ! - ( LAUGHING ) Stop , please . # Oh , sugar honey # You are my candy girl # And you 've got me wanting you Oh , my god , Helena , stop ! - Please . - # Ah honey # There 's no sign of inflammation . Are you okay ? No pain ? It 's fine . It 's promising . ( CHUCKLES ) Hey ! Contain yourself , please . Sarah 's scared now of getting sick , too . Her and Kira . As if she needed anything else to worry about . You had to tell them eventually . Yeah , but I wanted to have some answers , you know ? Give them something , not just more crappy news . You can offer hope . If these results stay positive , we move to implantation . Stem cells from the exfoliated dental pulp of baby teeth in my uterus . It 's not invasive at all . Come on . ( SCOFFS ) How do you even know this is a match ? The odds of compatibility are like a million-to-one . Luckily we only had to search thousands of samples before we found it . There are benefits to being a multinational . ( INHALES ) Pauvre petit chiot . - You 're the puppy . - ( MOBILE RINGING ) Dr Cormier . Who ? COSIMA : Hey , Scott ! - Cosima , hey ! - ( CHUCKLES ) Hi ! - What are you doing here ? - I can 't believe it , either . Dr Leekie personally approved my application . Did you know about this ? Well , we need a sequencing tech and you said he was the best . Okay , one sec . Delphine , we can 't involve him in this . That 's crazy . But he is involved . You gave him your samples . Yeah , but he doesn 't know that . Look , he found your synthetic sequence and we need an expert we can trust on examining that . Hey , sorry , we 're not hiring right now . - But ... - No . - Cosima ... - I know about the clones . GUS : I thought stealing from my kids was rock bottom . Till I , uh , blew my dealer in a bus station bathroom . It was pretty much get clean or die trying after that . MODERATOR : You 're 21 days , Gus . You 're stronger than you think . Alison . Me ? No , thank you . - I 'm going to sit this one out . - No , you won 't . You 're up . I 'm just here for my kids . And I 'm sorry that I ruined the play with my drinking . ( CHUCKLES ) - Alison , it 's not about sorry . - Hmm . It 's about taking responsibility . - Well , I 'm not an actual drunk , am I ? - ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) Sorry , I 'm so sorry . Back from the world . How was the specialist , Victor ? VICTOR : Whoo ! Doc offers me oxy . I was like , no thanks . So he offers me a local and I 'm like , " Mmm-mmm . " Then he gets to poking , snipping at the stump . Pain like a tidal wave but thank you , Lord . I just didn 't cave . MODERATOR : just don 't confuse suffering with healing , Victor . Victor . Yeah , no , I don 't want that for sure . MODERATOR : All right , let 's talk Family Day . ( LOUD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) ( MUSIC STOPS ) - Oi ! - Whoa ! Whoa ! Whoa ! Jesus Christ ! Get out ! Piss off ! Sarah told me to check on you . That is so thoughtful . Oh , my lord , that really takes the sting out of being framed for murder . I think you 've had enough ! Come on . Yeah , I 've had enough . My love life 's a shambles and I 've been demoted from babysitter to bargaining chip , so you 're right , Arthur , I 've had enough ! Okay , all right , all right . Come on . Bedtime . Arthur , you beast ! - I 'm not even taking any new clients . - Yeah ? - Yeah . - Then how about you take your hand off my ass ? ( LAUGHING ) Okay , everyone , that 's it . See you next week . Hey , whoa , whoa , whoa . - We need to talk . - Look , I 'm not Sarah . And I 'm not stupid . Do you ... - How you doing ? - Take care , man . You 're the one that maced me in the parking lot . Right ? What are you , twins ? We 're clones , Victor . What do you think of that ? Fine , you don 't want to tell me , it 's all outside those walls anyway . In all honesty , that face is the last thing that I ever wanted to see again . - Good than leave me alone . - But I can 't help but think that the godhead has put you here to test me . - The godhead ? - Yeah . Oh , my god , please , just let me eat my humble pie in peace . Thank you . This isn 't Cold River , Helena . The church . Is this where Duncan is ? Where he was last seen . Oh ! Maggie tracked him here . - Now we follow his trail , yes ? - Oh , no , no , no . You are staying in the car . Don 't cause any trouble . Can I have radio ? No , Helena , just don 't do anything , please . WOMAN : Can I help you with anything ? Uh ... What is this place ? I 've seen it before . That 's the Cold River Institute . Cold River . WOMAN : Yes , it was shut down in the ' 70s . What 's your interest in it ? Have you ever seen this man ? WOMAN : Mr Peckham . He 's been here a few times , to look at the archives . I 'd like to see the archives . Uh , no , I think they 're best left alone . Oh , well , I 'm a student of his . It 's for my thesis . Thirty-six base pair variation in identical samples . Didn 't make sense . But then you guys started asking about genetic patents , so I was like ... encoded marker tags , duh ! Anyway , uh , identical genomes with markers and embedded patents ? Had to be clones . So can I see one ? You want to see a clone ? Yeah . Well , let 's take it one step at a time . ( COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ) Starting early , huh ? Better pace yourself . I 'm on vacation . You want to join us ? We 're nicer than we look . I think you bed goats . ( BLEATING ) Are you being rude , you little skank ? I 'm not quite sure I heard what you said . ( GRUNTING ) Jesus ! You broke my finger ! Don 't be baby , I only sprain . Next one I break . - Meaning what ? - Hey , hey , let her be , Carl . - Carl . - Move it , Jesse . - She just ... - Made herself clear . Crazy bitch ! Sorry about that , ma 'am . - Miller , pork rind . - BARMAN : Sure thing . Here you go . White Russian ? Pork rind ? When the institution was torn down , we moved the records here for their historical value . Sometimes I wish we 'd burned the lot . Your professor was poking around in this section . 4910,1920 ... - Early years . But the institute was active a lot longer than most people think . Could you ? What you see here won 't leave you . Yeah , I get that feeling . You said you 'd bring the kids . I will , on Family Day . I wanted to see them today . Well , Alison , until you start taking this place seriously , I don 't think it 's a good environment for them . As if I 'm the one who should be in here proving myself . And what does that mean ? It means , Donnie , that once this is all over , you 'll have nowhere to hide . Okay , you know what ? Now you 're threatening me ... ( CHUCKLES ) I am not actually ... - ... and take that while you ... - If you show up here - without my kids again ... - Hey ! I will cut off your dangling balls ! HEY. you guys all good ? - Sorry ? - Anger is a tool and we use it on problems , not people . She 's working on this a lot harder than you think . Don 't do that . Well , I hope he 's right , honey . We 'll see you on Family Day . Fine . ( CLANGING ) Oh , God . Bollocks . Why are you still here ? Is that coffee ? Jesus , you 're the best date I 've had in ages . Holy shit , he 's moved in . Helena 's storage locker was a goldmine . I need your help . Are you serious ? God , this shit 's like pure nightmare fuel . Oi ! I don 't understand any of this . Well , welcome to the party . Come on , we got to put it all together . ( GRUNTING ) I know all about you . Felix told me all about Vic the Dick . Yeah , I 'm sure he did . I know you were abusive to Sarah . And that you attacked me in a parking lot . Yeah , I was in a lot of pain . But I 'm walking the path of the Buddha now ... Oh , would you quit it with the Buddha business ? You 're here for your kids , right ? Yes , why else would I be here ? ( LAUGHING ) Sure . Okay , I 'm a ... ( STUTTERING ) ... bottle-hider . Why do I have to admit that to a bunch of drug losers ? You don 't have to admit it but you will realise that sober smackheads are the best listeners so ... I feel like I 'm in the prison yard . ( LAUGHING ) Oh , terrible ! In Ukraine , I was police detective . I shot many criminals . Ukraine , huh ? ( SIGHS ) I 've never been further than Sioux Falls myself . Then I was brilliant scientist but I quit to be with my family . Oh , come on , don 't tell me you 're spoken for ? Divorced , after . He had drinking problems . ( INHALES ) But now I am with my sestra , having adventures . You sure have led a life , huh ? Wonder how a simple guy like me keeps a girl like you in a place like this ? ( SIGHS ) He would have to be very strong . ( GRUNTING ) No ! No ! Oh , God ! ( HELENA LAUGHING ) Here . You 're good . I didn 't even notice you on their tail until last night . Special Forces ? JTF 2 ? - Boy Scouts ? - Yep . But I never met a real Prolethean before . I expect Diane sent you after the other one ? Are you waiting till she drinks herself senseless or for the bar to clear out ? Just letting her enjoy herself a bit . She 's a miracle , I 'm told . Well , whatever she is , she 's not worth dying for . IS yours ? COSIMA : You know , good intentions , baa ' science . Sound familiar ? Not really . Should it ? Yeah , Project LEDA . I mean , Cold River is like the perfect ideological breeding ground for a nature-nurture cloning fiasco . ( SIGHS ) They did a shite job breeding us , didn 't they ? Well , science is what scientists do , Sarah . You know , nobody 's got any idea , we 're just poking at things with sticks . Are you going to be all right , Cosima ? Yeah , of course . Honestly . Honesty , we just , we just started testing with a new stem cell match , actually . I don 't know what that means . It 's promising . I can 't do this without you . Yeah , obviously . I 'm the geek monkey . ( CHUCKLES ) Yes , you are . Hey , when I get back , we 're going to get Alison out of rehab . I know , yeah , definitely . We 're stronger together . - Go figure . - Hold on . Cambridge biology delegation . COSIMA : Huh ? Duncan was at Cold River . ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ) ( GRUNTING ) You know what ? You have real pretty eyes . ( QUIVERING ) You have a nice hat . And very nice red face . ( GRUNTING ) - ( LAUGHING ) - Damn ! Oh ! All right . A " fight , fie-breaker . - Okay . - Let 's do this . - Real challenge , please . - ( SIGHS ) - Wait , wait , wait , wait ... - # Crazy ♪ That 's what they call me May I ? ♪ Walk along the razor 's edge ♪ Into black and back again ♪ Crazy ♪ That 's what they tell me ♪ No one 's heard a word I 've said ♪ You 've got me hanging by a thread Sarah 's off the table , so how about you take your girl and I 'll take mine ?

( SCREAMING CONTINUES ) There were some , uh , patient histories missing , some files missing . Pilfering . Another reason why I try to keep them locked up . You think it was my professor ? Mr Peckham ? I don 't think so , no . A woman came in after him , maybe another student friend of yours , uh , Margaret ? Asian ? - 40s ? - Yes . ( SIGHS ) Maggie Chen . Roy . Hey , come on , Roy ! Come on . Roy , Roy , please , come on , man , she didn 't do nothing ! I want my boyfriend . Roy ! Roy ! ( WHISPERS ) Sestra ! ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS , H ELENA HUMMING ) I want my boyfriend . - Where is Jesse ? - No idea . But those guys you beat up aren 't pressing charges . Good , so I continue my holiday . Yeah , soon as the paperwork 's done . Your , uh , sister 's here . Sister ... It 's good to see you . You tried to kill me . Yes . ( CHUCKLES ) My father and I , we don 't ... We don 't always see eye-to-eye , so ... He sewed you silent . Your lips . I had this also once . It will heal . Helena , we want you to come back . I have my sestra now . - She needs me . - She 's not coming back for you . Helena ... We want to take you to your children . You took my babies from inside me ! Your eggs . My father , he ... He made them whole for you . Why ? Because he sees something beautiful in you . But you don 't . It doesn 't matter what I see . He will take my babies and put them inside me like how I was made ? How ? Yes , like that . She 's free to go . Hello , Helena . Your friend asked me to give you this . Take me to my babies . SARAH : Can you make sure she 's all right ? BELL : Well , I can make some phone calls and see if I can get Helena released . Thanks , uh ... Look , there were files missing , okay ? Patient histories . Maggie Chen hid them in her locker , you should have something about a Peckham . Really ? Hang on . - Erm ... - What ? Here ! It 's a patient medical record for an Andrew Peckham . He died in 1943 , he was two years old . His father was deceased and his mother died in childbirth . An orphan . Yeah , well , look , if the date 's right , Duncan would be over 70 . You thinking what I 'm thinking , Fe ? That Duncan stole Peckham 's identity ? The archivist told me that Duncan got to the archives by car . So just find me an Andrew Peckham somewhere within old-man driving range . It 's good to have you here , Scott . Do you need anything ? Yeah , one thing . I signed my confidentiality agreement , okay ? - You guys can trust me . - Okay . Cosima had me looking at stem cell growth kinetics but I wanted to see if Dyad tagged them like they tagged the clones . So , I ran PCR . And ... They 're not clone cells . They 're from a totally different person . So I checked for familial markers . The clones share 13 STR loci with the stem cell donor . Whoever you cloned , do they have a female relative ? Like a niece or even a daughter ? Scott , you cannot tell Cosima about this . - Uh ... - Not ... Not one word ! Do you understand me ? Victor ! ( CLEARS THROAT ) - Hey , you want to come for a smoke ? - No , no , no , no , no . It 's not one of my vices . Well , I 'm kicking mine one at a time . Good . Well , I have to make these place settings for Family Day. just ... okay - I could use some help , if you ... Okay , sure . Two good hands between us , right ? Yeah . See you up there ? Yes , thank you . - Namaste . - No , don 't do that . - Okay . - ( CHUCKLES ) ( CLEARS THROAT ) How 's recovery going , Vic ? We 're going to make doilies together . - I 'm impressed . - Yea h ? That makes one of us . Hey , no second thoughts , we have a deal . I 'll get you your dirt on Alison Hendrix but my charges go away and I 'm done . No , I mean it , I 'm done . This shit 's cramping my recovery . Detective . BELL : Hey , I found an Andrew Peckham in Brockville . It 's about two and a half hours away . SARAH " . Thanks , Art . ( TURNS ENGINE OFF ) ( BIRDS CHIRPING ) Should have known you 'd show up . With shit on your shoe , no doubt . You bitch , you knew all along . My whole life , you knew . You 're just one of them , aren 't you ? I am not one of them . Just like you , I got caught up in a struggle I didn 't ask for . Only I 've been at it longer , so I 'm better at it than you . I didn 't come here for your shit , Siobhan ! Where 's Duncan ? - Is he here ? - His name is Peckham . It has been ever since he came over to our side , 20 years ago . We hid him in exchange for information about ... experiments on unborn children and a surrogate who ran away . - Amelia . - Yes . Carlton found you in the foster system and ... ( INHALES ) Dyad have been after us ever since . - I don 't believe a word you say . - ( SCOFFS ) The question is who do you trust ? ( KETTLE WHISTLING ) After you . ANDREW : Rosalyn . Come on , Rosalyn . Good girl . Come on . Andrew , I 've got someone who wants to meet you . Mmm ? Here . ( WATER RUNNING ) You 're ... Sarah Manning . - Not Rachel ? - She 's the one I told you about . Remember ? Amelia 's child . Sorry , forgive me . Yeah , it 's not what I 'm here for . Can I , um , get you both some tea ? Oh , you 've done it . We need to get moving , unfortunately . The birds can 't feed themselves . Rosalyn ... Don 't worry . I 'll take care of it . I always do . Five minutes . I 'm not sure where to start . I don 't know how many there are . We weren 't the only implantation team . Project LEDA , what are we for ? Proof of concept , how everything starts . The military recruited Susan and I in ... 1974 ? ' 75 ? - ' 76 . - Hmm . Susan was the brains , really . Did you know that she cracked the spindle protein problem ? What did you do ? We succeeded . Cloned human embryos . What a feat ! But an oversight committee declared us an ethical failure . Um , are you sure you won 't have some tea ? - How is Dyad involved ? - Contractor . When the military scuppered our work , Dyad persuaded us to push on to full-term . So Dyad hijacked Project LEDA ? Once you 've gone too far , it 's hard not to go all the way . Why ? What did you want ? Babies . Little girls . You know we 're not just a concept , right ? That we 're your consequences ! Have you met Rachel ? - My Rachel ? - Yes , I have . What a treat . You 've really created a monster there . We didn 't . We loved her . Now , please , I want to see her . What makes you think I 'd do that for you ? Hello , Paul . Sarah 's in there with Duncan ? Oh , yes . Tea ? It 's just tea , Paul . just a conversation . And what would I talk about with you ? Well , your next move , of course . I 've got biscuits in my pocket . No , thanks . Who sent you ? - Dyad . - Hardly an answer , Dyad 's a hydra . ( CLICKS TONGUE ) For God 's sake . If Sarah 's got between Leekie and Rachel , I bet you are , too . And a man with two masters answers only to himself . Who does Siobhan Sadler answer to ? I 'm the mum , aren 't I ? If you think you 're taking Sarah back , you 'll have to kill me . And if you think you 're going to take Duncan back , the only man alive who can give Sarah and her sisters what they need , then you 'll have to kill us both . But you don 't want to do that . Or Afghanistan would all have been for nought . What would you know about that ? Paul , in your position , you could really use a new friend . Was it ever real , your little family ? Or was it just an experiment ? - It was both . - So was Daddy Rachel 's first monitor ? - Of course , but ... - Do you know what Dyad 's done to her ? - What she 's become ? - That wasn 't us . It wasn 't even Dyad . It was the Neolutionists inside Dyad . Dr Leekie . - I don 't have to talk to you . - Yes , you do , and you know it ! It 's all in the past . No , it 's not ! This is my life ! And you gave it to me , so you 're going to help us ! - No . - Yes , you are ! I 'll take you to Leekie , you can talk to him , then . ( WEEPING ) They stole my daughter ! Your daughter is lost ! There 's just me and Alison , a housewife with two adopted kids . And Cosima , a brilliant scientist , just like you . I can 't ! We 're real , Ethan . Cosima is unlike anybody I 've ever met . And she 's sick . We 're sick . Your little girls are dying . It could happen to Rachel , too . I tried to stop it . You can help us now . You don 't understand . What don 't I understand ? Leekie ... Leekie wouldn 't let us raise her . We were going to expose everything but he found out and ... Go on , you can tell her . Who do you think I 've been hiding from all these years ? Aldous Leekie killed my Susan ! He killed Rachel 's mother ! ALISON : My neighbour Aynsley always thought she was better than me . - You have to learn to forgive ... - Then I killed her . Do you smell salt ? - Oh . - Aw ! I may have spiked his tea . They 're onto me . The computer 's been hacked , which means they could have my location . I 'm on the move . What have we there ? Everything , Mrs Sadler . Absolutely everything . I am impressed you 'd come here . I have something you want . Ripped By mstoll

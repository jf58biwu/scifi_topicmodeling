But the muzzle doesn 't have any hole . - I said don 't point it at me ! - Sorry . Sorry ! No , never mind . No please . Tell us . What is it ? I just recalled what happened when I was transported to the hospital . For some reason , I have a feeling that I was drugged there . Drugged ? Yes . The truth is , I was involved in a car accident . I was covered in blood and carried into an emergency room . Then I was injected with some drug through a syringe . Immediately after that , everything started to grow hazy ... Hold on a sec . Of course you got an injection . It 's a hospital after all . Yes , sorry . I see . I kinda understand what 's going on . As I thought , we are not yet dead . We were transported to the hospital while in apparent death , and everyone was injected with the same drug . What we are seeing right now are only hallucinations caused by that drug . Hallucinations ? It 's like group hypnotism . Perhaps everyone is seeing the same hallucinations . Hey , that 's exactly it ! By any chance , we are being made to participate in some sort of experiment . What 's happening ? Well , I don 't know . Hallucinations . Kei-chan ! What is this ? Eh ? " Please go . " Huh ? What ? We 're outside ? Eh ? What 's happening ? We got outside right ? This means we can go home , right ? I 'm bored of this . Please wait a minute . Excuse me . I 'm just telling you these things because I don 't want to cheat . This is a television program . You all are participating while in your state of apparent death . We aren 't dead yet ! See ? We aren 't dead ! My dad is the producer . American Cable Television and Yale University cooperated together to develop this new project . Do you know about reality shows ? It 's just like a virtual version of ATO . You don 't know about it ? " American Tryout . " The main point is , if you get to complete the mission , you will receive 100 thousand dollars as prize money . I wanted that money so I got to join because of my dad . 100 thousand dollars ? 10 million yen ? Katou , look at that . Eh ? Please look carefully . That is the target mentioned earlier . What ? Really ? Ah - Time limit is 20 minutes . The first person to defeat him will be awarded with all the money . - Seriously ? - Wait for me !

Wasn 't it amazing ? The grand way that yakuza was finished off . And that man who said the stuff about hypnotism too . He was stepped on nicely and got crushed . He didn 't even realize he was being killed . But listen . These days there is even more incredible stuff ... You ... Why didn 't you help them ? They were being killed , you know ! There are people like you around huh ? Such a hypocrite . You really don 't understand anything ! You chose to mess with the wrong person . Let go of Katou . Huh ? Are you gonna shoot ?

What is it that you want to do after you enter our company ? Yes ? What do you want to do ? Ah ... Saying that during an interview , of course you would fail . Give them a better impression of your characters ! But I heard Kurono hasn 't got any unofficial offer yet . Kurono ? He hasn 't decided to take any offer yet huh ? He has none . No matter what one says , Kurono unexpectedly doesn 't have any presence at all . He 's the type that companies everywhere don 't need the most . He 's even boasted that he was the hero of his soccer club a long time ago . What ? That was from his primary school days . He 's the type that might as well disappear in a company . That 's all for today 's lecture . We 'll end here . Um ... Please don 't be bothered about them . It seems that I 'm also just like the air anyway .

But I 'm going back now . How 's it going ? Your job hunting ? Yeah ... Well , it 's just normal . Akira already decided to go to to university a long time ago . You must do your best too . His house 's no longer here . Sorry ... Ah - oh ... Ah ... You can recognize me ? Wait . This is ... When I woke up , I was wearing it . I tried to find Katou 's house . Katou-san ? Well , I want to confirm with him what happened the day before yesterday . But ... Seems that he 's already moved . His address was from 10 years ago anyway . Is that right ? Shall we go to the police ? I don 't think they will believe us . You 're right . Shall I send you off until the station ? Okay ? Um ... I have a favor to ask of you . What is it ? Will you let me stay over tonight ? Yes . Yes ? Is it okay for me to sleep on the bed ? Sure , go ahead . Thank you . But if I sleep on the floor , my body will surely ache all over . Shall I sleep on the floor then ? Ah it 's fine . Just sleep on the bed . But Kishimoto-san . Is it really fine this way ? You 're not going home . My boyfriend 's belongings are there . You were living together ? We broke up the other day . He went to another woman 's house . Oh . Ah - I see . Then , I just did it unconsciously while in the bathroom cutting my wrist . I wasn 't doing it for real though . You committed suicided ? Then , when I recovered , I was at home . All that while I couldn 't bear to look at the bathroom . I thought there might be full of blood from my dead body , and felt scared . What is that ? Katou-san 's coat that I borrowed from him . I want to meet him . To return him this and thank him . It 's his notebook . Maybe his current address is written here . Hm ? Probation ? " Under probation . Katou Masaru " He was in a juvenile institution ? Let 's stop this . Eh ? But his address is written there . What ? So he 's like that ? Somehow I heard that he didn 't go to high school or something . Who cares about such a thing ? Well long ago , many things happened to his family . His drunken father used to turn violent . Well he 's definitely like that too ... Katou-san is not that kind of person .

Where , you ask ... Kurono-kun , have you ever read manga ? Of course I have . Do you like it ? Just normally ... I guess . Um ... please don 't laugh at me . Um ... I draw manga . What kind ? How is it ? Amazing . Though it 's a story with a hero and such , I drew it as a shoujo manga . Don 't you think it 's pretty awful ? It 's about a normal guy like Kurono-kun who is chosen to be the hero of justice ... He 's like my old self . Eh ? No . I just remembered something . When I was a kid , I used to protect another weak kid who was bullied then . Is that right ? Yeah . I happened to meet that weak guy again the other day . But I guess he doesn 't remember that I used to protect him . As expected , heroes have to destroy the bad guys . The weak one can just run away because everyone 's protecting him . Ah - Sorry . This ... Did you meet my younger brother ? But I didn 't talk to him . Um , I just don 't know how to explain all this . Katou-san . What does it mean to us by waking up in that place ? Are we dead ? Or alive ? When I arrived at that room , I thought I could finally die . For a long time , I 've been thinking that I should just die . But now , I want to live longer . It 's because I met you , Katou-san . I was saved by you . That 's why ... I used to be in a juvenile institution . I killed my dad .

It 's just futile for you to explain those things to people who are here for the first time . Kei-chan , don 't you want to save these people ? Told you I 'll do it alone .

You 're getting in the way ! With this , you won 't have any complain right ? That was no good at all . The other people have died . That 's because you didn 't manage to have everyone escape right ? Well , doesn 't matter . Next time , you can just help everyone run away . I will destroy the enemies by myself . Huh ? What the ? We can 't go back to the room yet ? It hurts ... Oi ! Did she die ?

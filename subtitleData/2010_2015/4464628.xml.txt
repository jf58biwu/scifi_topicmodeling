 We believe that this man was somehow connected to the blackout . He 's highly efficient in advanced computing equipment . He also seems to have a penchant for chess . The man you call D. Gibbons- - his real name is Dyson frost . Hello , demetri . My name is Dyson frost . Got your attention , didn 't I ? In my flash-forward , I saw this symbol . I remember the images , but I just can 't put them together . Your have to find her , Bryce . Our entire investigation hinges on what 's in your head . I 'm here to make sure you don 't lose it before April 29th . We went to Utah . Officer down ! D. Gibbons knew we re coming . You unearthed the Somalia photos . Five minutes later , we 're getting shot at . Whoever we 're investigating knows what we 're doing before we 're doing . We have ' em all . You 're forgetting there 's another part to what we saw- - the part where we 're not together . Hey , honey . I want to go away with you and with Charlie . I just want to get away from all of this . Yes or no ? Thanks . Hey , I 'm sorry . I was in surgery . - Oh , I 'm fine . I 'm fine . - Oh , God . What happened ? Um , I ran into a bullet . Babe , I 'm serious . 6 inches this way , this bullet 's in your heart . I know . I 'm not sure I can handle this anymore . Livy , I was an FBI Agent when you married me . But it is different now . We have a daughter . I mean , if something happens to you , I ... I don 't wanna ... Look , I get that this is who you are . But it--it 's different . I-I mean , I 've got to know that our family comes first . Something 's gotta change . Wedeck offered me a position on the dhs counterterrorism task force . It 's an improvement ? Uh ... it 's surveillance . Two guys in a car eating burritos , listening to phone calls in Farsi . I 'll be out of the line of fire . My biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol . You 're gonna hate that . Mm , but I can take it . What I can 't take is losing you and Charlie . Our family will always come first . I promise . So , um , if you need anything , I 'll be staying at the wedecks ' . I 'm sorry . I have no idea how to do this . Neither do I. She 's been in there 20 minutes . I 'll call you tonight . Are you my new partner ? If you are , I insist you change your clothes . Can 't catch bad guys in pajamas . Where are you going ? I 'm just going to the wedecks' for a little while . How long is a little while ? Well , I ... hope it 's not very long at all . What 's this ? You lost your bracelet . It 'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home . Let me put it back on . Come here . I love you so much , charlie-bear . if you 're watching this message in 2010 , that means the global blackout was successful . That also means we 've had a near miss in pigeon , Utah . How do I know all this ? Because I myself have had hundreds of flash-forwards . In nearly all of my futures , i end up dying on march 15th- - like you , demetri . So if you managed to find this tape in Somalia , it would seem our fates are on a collision course , and the possible outcomes of the game are rapidly narrowing . As for the endgame , the next move is mark benford 's . That 's Dyson frost ? - And it 's genuine ? - Yeah . It 's legit . Degradation rate in the magnetic tape plus the date of production makes it authentic . The only explanation , however implausible , is that frost flashed-forward from 1991 to our present and saw us in Somalia . Then in 1991 , he makes a tape he knows we 'd find . That 's a 19-year flash-forward . And march 15th--the day he dies in his future ... Is the date I 'm supposed to be murdered . Maybe that 's the collision course he 's talking about . Dem , frost talks about narrowing outcomes- - another indication that what people see in their flash-forwards ... Are only possibilities . Could be warning us . Warning us about what ? There 's gonna be another blackout . What ? How ? When ? We have to assume that 's Agent benford 's next move- - to find out and to prevent it . So let 's make it a good one . Find Dyson frost ... yesterday . This is magnificent work . Master circuits built from basic sketches I designed when I was 13 . Well , when you finish patting yourself on the back , can we get to work ? I had to go to a lot of trouble to get all this , not to mention what I had to go through in that basement . Yes , I know--the missing dig . A terrible loss . You find anything in those documents we got in Somalia ? Yeah , um , a couple of things . There were several references to tachyonic dark matter . In ' 91 ? How is that possible ? Well , the theoretical basis existed . - But the experiment failed . - Because they needed us . Well , clearly , you 're missing the silver lining . The blackout- - we 're off the hook . Not our fault . Frost flash-forwarded in ' 91 using technology that we did not develop . Simon , flosso said our n.L.A.P. Experiment amplified the blackout . We can 't dodge that . Find anything else interesting ? I saw this formula in my flash-forward ... Written on a mirror . It 's the exact inverse of some of our early n.L.A.P. Computations . I don 't know--maybe a process to reverse the blackout ? You 're working on blackout protection in your flash-forward ? I don 't know , but it was this formula , and there was ... There was more of it written on the mirror , and the two of them are combined somehow . Well , we need the other formula that you saw on the benfords ' mirror . Go see your girlfriend . Ticktock . Nothing . I ran face recognition software on every available database . Since frost faked his death in 1990 , there is not one record--not one sighting of this guy . Nothing . He 's a thorough guy- - likes complex things like chess . He 's also got an arrogant streak- - likes people to know when he 's winning . I 've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre - ' 90 . Frost placed third in an amateur league in ' 87 . And the guy he beat lives in San Francisco . His name is Ian mckinnon . Mckinnon was the reigning champion until frost beat him in an upset . So I traced him and then I gave him a call . But when I mentioned frost , he hung up . Well , let 's travel . We need to get to San Francisco and talk to him , right ? Yeah . But first , there 's something else . This is frost 's final tournament against mckinnon . He uses a very risky play called the queen sacrifice . Looks like a total hail Mary , but it 's one of the most effective plays in the game . - Okay , so what ? - He knew we would see these games . It 's another message from 1991 . Tournament game sheets . Each of his moves takes either two or four seconds- - never more , never less . In the three games , he made 50 moves , after which he resigned . So this is a code of some kind . Wait . Is this ... This is morse code . 2-second moves are dots . 4-second moves are dashes . There are 50 moves , so 50 characters . - And this is just jumbles of letters here . - Not letters . Numbers in morse code have five dots or dashes . 50 divided by 5 is 10- - 10 digits . Is it a phone number ? Prepaid cell . He really did know the future . Well done . Leave a message . Dyson frost ? This is Agent benford . It 's your move . Now we 're traveling . In English , please . I know you like halibut . Some just came in this morning . No , thank you . I ate ... some cereal . Oh , that 's not enough . You need protein . You are kind , but I can 't . It 's ... too much money . I want a ... new beginning . And new love . - Some miso soup , a little rice ? - Okay . Okay . Not today . Come here often ? I 'm beginning to feel like a regular . Don 't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward ? Bryce , you 're my friend . You 're crazy if you think I 'm gonna let you - go through this alone . - I appreciate what you 're doing , but I don 't want you to see me like this . - Is this about your pride ? - A little bit , yeah . Hello , it 's me . You 've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother . I think we 've both seen behind the curtain . Besides , the chemo 's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours . So tonight , let 's have some fun . Okay , let 's do it . But I 'm buying dinner . You call s.F.P.D. ? What do you think ? Right behind you . Help you guys ? Special Agent benford . Agent noh . Detective John Smith . Yes , that 's my real name . - What do you need ? - What happened here ? Eh , some guy from the chess club - took two in the back of the head . - Don 't tell me--ian mckinnon ? Yeah , Ian mckinnon . Person of interest ? Not anymore . Ian mckinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the ' 8os , and now he 's dead . He was our best lead on frost , but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation . San Francisco bureau is handling the follow-up , but I 'm not expecting much . How long between when you first made contact - and time of death ? - Eight hours tops . There 's only one conclusion . The leak we 've been tracking- - that 's compromised the security of the whole mosaic investigation- is inside the bureau . - Not just the bureau . No . Inside our office . I 've been ordered to give full agency support , fresh pair of eyes , all the rest of that crap . You got a play ? My dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing . He 'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water and watch the fish float to the top . It was ugly , but it worked . Game on . Just don 't forget who your friends are . What 's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy . - I need you to step away from your desk . - What the hell is going on here ? Everyone 's required to assemble in the conference room , sir . On whose authorization ? Sorry , Assistant Director Wedeck . - Orders . - Whose orders ? I 'm not at liberty to say . That 's not part of the task force agreement . Uh , no calls , and I 'll need your cell phone , please . - Don 't touch me , all right ? - Sir , your phone . What 's going on ? Someone lose their keys ? - Simon campos ? - Yeah ? You 're in there also , sir . I 'm not really an employee . I 'm more of a visitor . What is this ? I 've not even had my coffee yet . What 's this about ? Judging from the way our offices are being torn apart , I 'd say an interagency task force has been formed and is looking for a leak . We can 't just look for the leak on our own ? Yeah . I think the point is , one of us is a mole . And mark ? Apparently already vetted . This office has been swept . ♪ you are the sunshine of my life ♪ ♪ girl ♪ ♪ forever you 'll stay in my heart ♪ ♪ you are the apple ♪ Tweezers . There 's your leak . Get out . It 's voice-activated . When your office is swept for bugs at 4 : 00 A.M ... The sweepers don 't make any sound . No sound , no transmission . You 've vetted the sweepers ? Since the blackout , all techs have been agency-contracted- - blind assignments . That 's how you do security . They just don 't know about the singing . So who has access to your office , mark ? Everyone in that room . Time to light the fuse . Ladies and gentlemen , as you may have deduced , we 're closing in on a leak inside the FBI that is hampering the mosaic investigation . Now anyone want to confess ? No ? Then it 's the hard road . You 'll be first , Agent noh , as you were part of the failed attempt to contact Ian mckinnon . You got anything to say about this ? We have to do this . Vogel , you 're a son of a bitch . You know that ? True as that may be , I 'm working with Agent benford today . I was with you the whole time in San Francisco . - I don 't think you 're the mole . - Who then ? Someone in that room . If you don 't think I 'm the mole , what the hell am I doing in here ? I need the mole to think I suspect everyone , even you . How long are we gonna be stuck in here ? Good question . They 've got their whole procedure to go through- - re-vet contact histories , bureau records , computers . That could take days . They 're gonna want to vet all of our personal files . Not if they don 't have passwords . You didn 't give up your passwords ? Not to my personal files , no . Something on your computer you don 't want people to see ? No , I mean , nothing that 's ... sensitive . You know , I 'm--I 'm clean . It 's porn . Agent curdy , downloading naked cheerleaders on FBI time ? It--it 's nothing like that . It 's--it 's--it 's , um ... It 's just ... it 's an r.P.G. Oh . What ? It 's--it 's an r.P.G. It 's a role-playing game . I play " warlocks of avalon " online . I 'm a seventh level druid . My name is " argothic . " You have any special powers ? Um , cape of invisibility , lightning hammer , elixir of life , healing . - That 's impressive . - Yeah , it 's cool . You 're next . Vreede . Can I borrow that cape ? There any reason we can 't get back to work , do something useful ? Vogel found a microtransmitter ... In that key . You want to be useful ? Tell me who put that in my office . - You think it was one of us ? - That 's the working theory . Hmm . " M " ... for " mark . " Nice touch . Unless it was you , marcie . Can you shut up for , like , five minutes ? - Want some sugar ? - I don 't use sugar . Mark ? We 're with you . You know that . Thanks . But we 're close . We 'll get him . Good thing the fate of the planet doesn 't rely on mark benford finding the mole . Son of a bitch ! Excuse me ! Koreatown 's further West . No . I 'm not korean . I 'm Japanese . Either way , you gotta get on the bus . You want this car to do that ? That 's the idea . I look ? You look ? You look like you don 't belong here , and you definitely don 't belong under the car . Hydraulics or nitrogen air bags ? Hydraulics . Could be fracture in cylinder . I can help . Maybe I surprise you , yes ? Okay , ninja girl . But if you break my axle , I 'm coming after you . Mm-hmm . Thank you . This is really screwing with my trust issues . You know that ? Yeah , you 've been through a lot , Janis . I took a bullet , mark . And I 'm seriously a suspect ? You have to admit that getting shot and living - makes for a perfect cover . - Screw you , vogel . I 'm sure there 's a reason for this , but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks in the weeks since the blackout--13 in all . So ? In the three previous years at the bureau , you 've taken precisely ... two . Mark , you know what I saw in my flash-forward . I 've been going to a fertility clinic . Yeah . You only had eight visits . We checked . So what ? So I went out to ... go buy some shoes . - Come on , mark . - Where were you ? Hmm ? What is it , Janis ? Ever since the shooting , I 've been looking at everyone differently ... Suspicious . Just checking up . And you found something ? Does he have to be here for this ? Marcie has a brother . We know about him . There 's another one ... A half brother . He 's very sick . He 's dying in Missouri in a full care facility . It 's expensive . Marcie didn 't name him in any of her applications . Those absences ... I went off site to look into some things . - You never mentioned this before . - I was waiting . For what ? I was waiting to see if she did something . And Marcie 's paying for this care ? There was a deposit made to an account for $ 50,000 three months ago- - anonymous . Okay , Janis . Thanks . Mark , I don 't know anything for sure . - I 'm just trying to help . - You 've done the right thing . It doesn 't feel like it . You trust her ? You know what , vogel ? Being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore . It 's gonna rain . Yep , but we 're together . We 're having a girls ' day . I don 't want to have a girls ' day . I want daddy to be here . Daddy wants to be here , too . Then why isn 't he ? Here 's the thing , sweetie . Daddy and I love each other very much . But most of all , we love you . And we 're always gonna be a family . That 's never gonna change . I promise . Come on . Let 's go for a ride . - Yeah ? - Okay . - Let 's do it . - Can I ride the Ferris wheel ? - You want to go on the Ferris wheel ? - Uh-huh . Hey . So I went through Marcie 's background . She did declare her brother in her initial application . But Janis said she didn 't . The original vetting records were at a regional field office . When they were routed to D.C. , an entirely separate file was created . It was easy to miss , man . You okay ? Yeah . No . No . I moved out of the house . Yeah . Olivia and me--we 're ... I don 't know . I-I moved out . Sorry . Is this about what you saw in your flash-forward ? Mm-hmm . Partly that , partly what she saw . Is there anything I can do ? No . But Marcie 's still a suspect , so keep digging . All right . Tell your future . Step up and I In your future ... Can we do that again ? No , my love . Let 's go . Let 's go . - Okay , let 's go . - Can we go again ? Can we go again ? No , sweetie . Why are you following us ? Because it 's my job . I 'm special Agent Danforth crowley . Your husband assigned me to be your security detail . Your safety is his number one priority . You don 't know much English , so I know you don 't have a work visa . I can try to get you paid off the books . That 's your first job . Client wants more horsepower , so we 've been trying to remap the e.C.U. My guys only work on carbureted engines , so for them it 's like ... Japanese . German . You said you were some big-time engineer back in Japan . Maybe you can figure this out . Yes . It is no problem . Yo , emil . You didn 't tell us you were hiring a masseuse . Listen up . Cut the music . I got something to say . This is keiko . She works here now . That means she 's part of the family . Treat her with respect , or we 're gonna have a problem . Everyone get that ? I 'll take that as a yes . All right . Get to work . Hey , it 's me . I just wanted to thank you for that security detail . It scared the hell out of me , but I guess it helps . Charlie misses you . Um , anyway , I 'm at the hospital , so call me if you- - Olivia ? We need to talk . I swear I wouldn 't bother you if it wasn 't absolutely necessary . Wow , you literally have the world 's worst timing . Well , yeah . I 've heard that before . What do you want , Lloyd ? Okay , I need to know exactly what you saw in your flash-forward . I wrote a formula on your bedroom mirror , and I think it relates somehow to the global blackout , but what I saw was incomplete . Did you see it ? Yes , I did ... part of it . I have to make a call . After a while , I got up from the bed . Then I noticed something was written on the mirror . It was written in lipstick . Most of it was indecipherable , but I did recognize this . Halothane . It 's an anesthetic . Quantum physics and anesthetics ... That 's what mark and I were working on in our flash-forward . I thought q.E.D. Meant quantum electrodynamics . But we were ... building a quantum entanglement device . Good . Well , that clears that up . I have to be getting on with my rounds . Uh , yes , right . Of course . Listen , I-I don 't want you to think I-I 'm harassing you . No , I know . You 're just trying to save the world . Good-bye . So you come here every single night just in case this guy shows up ? And during the daytime . I know . I know . But it 's the only way I can find him . All right . I respect that . You saw your fate , and now you 're doing your thing . When I saw my future , it was the best day of my life . It was the first day I let myself want what was in my heart . So like you say , I am doing my thing . Can I ask , what did you see ? Something different than you . Let 's leave it at that . You are kind to give me a job . We 're lucky to have you . Thank you , emil . You ever tried sea urchin ? No . Is it good ? It 's like eating somebody 's thyroid . Ah . Well , I 'm sure keiko loves it . And if she 's the woman you were in love with in your vision , you have to eat it with her . Wait . This- - this could be a problem . What if Sushi 's her favorite food , and that 's all she ever wants to eat ? Okay . Suddenly she 's a mogwai . You 're being ridiculous . A-a what ? - Never mind . - Wait . What--what 's a mogwai ? I 'm not explaining it to you . Justify your metaphor , young lady . God . Um , mogwai- - you know , gizmo- - the little furry creatures that turn into gremlins if you don 't feed ' em right . They had dietary restrictions . It 's--forget it . Wow . I know . It 's a very nerdy metaphor . - Just shut up and read the menu . - Okay . I don 't know . - I 'm just not feeling Sushi tonight . - Well , I am . Okay . I guess I can have teriyaki . You 're kind of a spoiled brat . I never noticed that about you before . How dare you ? I have cancer . All right . What do you want to do ? Bryce . I 'm sorry . Um ... I don 't know why- - why I just did that . I-I know why I did that , but ... It 's--you 're thinking about another woman . You know , you can 't just kiss me ... In little Tokyo , no less . Yeah , I know . I 'm , um , sorry . It 's just ... You 're great . Honest mistake . Hey , just buy me a burger , and we 'll call it even . Deal . - Good morning , keiko . - Morning . Too much sake ? - Mm . - Next time we have Tequila . Mm . How 's it going ? Mm . This car will go very fast . You know , we just need a little more horsepower . We 're not trying to launch it into space , you know ? Immigration ! I.C.E. Nobody move ! Hands behind your heads ! Just do what I do . Hands behind your head ! Move it ! Put your hands up now ! Now ! Do it now ! Don 't move ! You emil gutierrez ? You 're under arrest for employment of undocumented workers . What 's your name ? Keiko . Do you have an I-9 ? I-9 ? Surprise , surprise . All right . Load ' em into the van . Let 's go . Hey , it 's me . Listen , I-I had a-a great time last night ... Uh , and I 'm--I 'm sorry about kissing you . Um ... You know , actually , I 'm--I 'm ... I 'm not . I 'm glad . So ... Okay , well , anyway .. Uh , bye . They 've been in there 36 hours . Got anything ? All of Marcie 's background has been gone through by vogel 's people already- - financials , phone records , background checks up the wazoo . I 'm doing surveillance tagging right now . This surveillance tech is good . Wait . Go back . Go back there . How many times does she have coffee ? She has coffee most of the time . Why ? She doesn 't use sugar . Okay . Give me time stamps for every time she put sugar in her coffee . Each of these time stamps corresponds to a day a key piece of information was leaked . Look at that . No one knew about the pigeon , Utah , trip ... Crap ! Or the Somali intel that triggered the attack in Washington . Every time she put sugar in her coffee , she was signaling her handlers . Marcie , what are you doing ? Down ! Everybody down ! Down , down , down ! Get down ! Go ! Cut her off at the stairs ! Go , go , go ! Down , down , down ! Down ! Down ! Aah ! Aah ! Hold fire , hold fire . Aah ! Marcie . Get her out of here . It looks like you were right , Janis . I wish I wasn 't . Huh . You could have let me in on it . I couldn 't say anything . Orders . You told demetri . It was discretionary . I needed people in that room . So I was manipulated for the greater good . Queen sacrifice- - Frost 's play . How 'd you know about that ? We all have our ways , mark . Benford . Agent benford . Dyson frost . Don 't speak . Just listen . I haven 't come forward since all your leads end up dead . But now that your mole problem has been fixed , I look forward to meeting you . I 'll be in touch . You were quite the hero today . I like a woman who knows how to handle a firearm . Fancy a drink ? I 'm not really your type . I think you 'd be surprised to learn exactly what my type is . I reviewed your Uncle Teddy 's autopsy x-rays . The c.P.R. You gave him was quite aggressive . Could have even been the cause of his death . Yeah , I , uh , can be quite a tiger . You murdered him to send a message . Message received . I should have known . A double plant . Two moles , in case one is caught . Brilliant . And not one person in the office would suspect it 's you . Not one . Well , that would be the point , now wouldn 't it ?

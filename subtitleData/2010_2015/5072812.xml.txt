 NEWS : There are unconfirmed reports now of a new outbreak , that 's a third outbreak of Russian flu near Hexham . That 's after last night 's outbreaks at Lochinver and Fort William , where 12 people are now confirmed dead . The Government are urging the public not to panic , but scenes of disorder are being reported in Edinburgh , Sunderland and Perth as GPs ' surgeries are besieged with thousands of inquiries . It 's all there . Everything they did . The experiments . The people they murdered . Everything - Don 't find out the truth about our father . We need to find out why they want the manuscript . It has the identity of Mr Rabbit . He is the beating heart of all of this , and if we can find his identity , it ends and you go home . We go and we see if he 's got the Chinese character for " rabbit " carved on his back . What ? And then what ? Whack him ? Tomorrow at noon I 'm gonna be here with every ounce of Thoraxin I have . Get me those pages , you get it all . You 're right . It 's better than genocide . That 's my assistant 's e-mail . If you get the manuscript , contact him . ( GROANS ) I 'll take Grant . He 's bound to recognise him . Do you think we can trust him ? - Run ! Run ! - ( SHE SCREAMS ) The purpose of Janus is to sterilise the entire human race . What we have is an approximation . We 're trying it on a test group . And the test group is ... ? The United Kingdom . Where the fuck have you been ? Answer her question ! The last time I saw you , you put a gun to my head . I needed to get the manuscript . I set a trap . You were bait . I 'm sorry . - Let 's move on . - Oh , you are such a fucking twat . Where 's Grant ? At the end of the manuscript , the scientist shouts the name of Mr Rabbit . I gave a bunch of pages to Grant . The name was in them . They must be here somewhere . I want those pages . Where is Grant ? ALICE : Are we going to find Grant ? Alice we don 't know where he is . I 'm sorry . Hey . - You OK ? - What ? What do you mean ? Oh , yeah . Just a bit stabbed . What about Janus ? Is it in there ? Wilson , is it in there ? I ... I dunno . Well , there 's this . It 's Carvel . He 's hiding Janus . You can 't see what in , but he says it 's in his greatest achievement . And then there 's this . It 's the god with two faces . Janus . - What ? - No ! No . No , that 's our bedding ! For fuck 's sake , pack it in ! Where did he put them ? I want those pages , and I want ... I know ! You want Mr Rabbit . But going off and killing him isn 't going to make your father any less of a cock than he was . You psychoanalysing me , Becky ? We best pals now ? You want to borrow my lipstick ? Shit . Are you wearing make-up ? ( ALICE CLEARS HER THROAT ) He thought no-one saw . But he 's rubbish at hiding things . Can we get Grant back now , please ? ( BUZZING , DOOR OPENS ) This is a Taser . You did these drawings ? You copied them from the manuscript , didn 't you ? These numbers are a code . We believe it describes the molecular structure of a protein we call Janus . Do you know what Janus is , Grant ? You did a very , very good job . The drawing 's excellent . But not complete . There are three five-digit numbers missing . Do you remember them ? Are you sure , Grant ? Because this is very ... ( SPITS ) There 's a theory of mnemonics that states that human minds retain all visual information ever seen in a lifetime . This means you do know the numbers . Mum ? That 's my mum . That 's ... No ! Wave for us , Alexi . Your camera . Wave again , Alexi . Now , there are many commands I can give Alexi . And he will obey them all . The command I would dearly love to give is " stand down , Alexi " . But that depends on you . Please ! - I 'm going to leave the laptop here . - Please don 't hurt my mum . Please ! And I 'm going to leave this . And when you remember a number , write it in , press this buzzer , and I 'll come back . ( DOOR SHUTS ) " Letan " ? So Letan 's Mr Rabbit ? Well , who 's Letan ? Jessica , who 's Letan ? I have no idea ! Wilson , do you think you can hack into central records at GCHQ ? No . I mean , yeah , obviously , I can . I need a computer . And not to mention internet . We 'll be outside . That 's not to leave this room . Could say " please " . Please , Becky , don 't take the manuscript out of this room or I will rip your fucking head off . Well , what about Grant ? We can 't just leave him ! What about Grant ? ! Holy bloody sweaty bollocks ! ( BEEPING ) ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) - just in here . - Thanks . Doctor here ? Is problem ? No , no . It 's just a checkup . We have private cover for you , Anya , so ... the doctor will be coming to you . Er ... just ... wait here , Michael . TV : Well , I haven 't caught anything . I 've seen a couple moving up there ... - ( CHANGES CHANNEL ) - The Prime Minister has commended the Health Minister , Geoff Lawson , for stepping up production of the vaccine after Fetlar , describing him as a national hero . He said that the health department 's contingency planning has potentially averted a crisis that none of us could even bear to imagine . We 're telling people to stay calm . Do not travel unless you absolutely have to . Keep children , the elderly and the most vulnerable at home . We have a vaccine . I repeat , we have a working Russian flu vaccine , and it will be going out tomorrow morning . ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) ( DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES ) You wanted to see me ? I need you to do something . There 's a requirement , as part of the procedural safeguards , that the flu vaccine must be independently tested in situ 24 hours before its release . That testing must be verified by the department , and , of course , to guarantee transparency , it can 't be a minister . It has to be a civil servant . In fact , it has to be the private secretary with responsibility for procurement . I 've supplied a team . They 're downstairs . Don 't question their results . Just sign it off . Jesus ! This is why it 's me ? This ... This whole thing has been about that ? PRIME MINISTER : Your security pass has been given clearance . Go there , get it done . Then get on with your life . Stay back . Stay back over there . Right , this is all the Thoraxin I have . If I see anything odd , anything that looks like a weapon , it goes in the fucking lake , I swear . Do you understand ? Now , do you have it ? Do you have the pages ? Yeah , what I 've got for you 's in here . What is this , some kind of joke ? No joke . I 've come to say that you 'll get nothing from me ever again . Are you forgetting what 's in here ? Becky , stop shitting around ! I 've ... I 've told them I have it . I 've got a meeting arranged . I 've got ... Well , then , you 'd better run . Then what are you here for ? To ask you for that . To ask you to do one decent thing in your whole life . To ask you ... to give me those drugs . YOU OK ? I don 't know if the Deel 's has kicked in , you know ? The clumsiness could be psychosomatic . Or stress . That happens . My dad had full-on fits . That 's how we first knew . I 'm not going to leave you . I just won 't . It was tremors , loss of muscle control ... paralysis and eventually suffocation and death . I don 't know if I want to go through all that with someone watching me . How 's it going ? ALICE : Is it a code , then ? Um ... Yeah , probably . In part one , people always thought this was binary or dates , but ... no-one has ever been able to work it out . But ... in this ... Part ... there 's a corresponding page ... The numbers are boring . I like the art . Well , can you get in ? Get in ? I am in . It 's UK security . Practically takes your shoes off and makes you a cup of tea . It 's the searches that are taking the time . I 'm having to make myself look like a UFO nutter just to get below the radar , which means I 've got to check each database individually . Well , how many databases are there ? 56,000 . Or thereabouts . Tell you what , why don 't you take the mobile unit outside and check the civilian channels ? No . I 'll do it here . ( HE SIGHS ) ( BUZZER ) ( DOOR OPENS ) I wrote it in . Well , this looks like we 're getting somewhere . Only two to go . No , mate ... I ... I can 't . I 've been trying so hard , but please , I can 't , I can 't ... Please ... Then we 'll have to bring your mother in and torture her in front of you . Please don 't make me do that , Grant . ( INTERCOM BUZZES ) - Hello ? - Hi , Anya , it 's Michael . - Where is he ? - What ? I ... I ... I don 't know . I don 't know ! Christ ! Christ , I 'm not ... I 'm not ... I 'm not part of them , I 'm just ... Look , look , look ... I was protecting my family ! There is a woman here who 's having my child . I was just ... I know where the vaccine is . I can help . Please ! I want to help ! ( KNOCK ON DOOR ) ( ANYA SCREAMS ) Anya , no ! It 's fine . It 's ... Calm her down . Calm her the fuck down ! Anya , Anya , please ! Please . It 's fine . It 's OK , he 's not going to hurt us . OK ? ! He has gun , Michael . I know . I just need to give him some information - and then it 'll be OK ... - Information ? ! Anya , please , I swear it 'll be OK ! No . Whoa ! Anya 's ... Anya 's pregnant . It 's ... it 's my child . They blackmailed me . So , why are you helping us now ? The vaccine goes out tomorrow . 64 million shots . The warehouse is at , erm 164 Cantwell Way , Stevenage . You got a computer here ? - Why ? - Google Maps . If there isn 't a warehouse there , I 'm gonna blow your fucking brains out . I 'm sorry . I ... I was trying to protect people . I wanted my family safe ... So you just handed us over ? Michael ? He make trouble , yes ? - Please , I not trust ... - It 's all right . Anya , please ! It 's all right , I promise ! There . There . I-I-I ... want to help . I can get you inside , if you just trust me . Anya , no , don 't ! He 's not ... Oh , Anya , no ! Don 't , he 's not what ... ( ENGLISH ACCENT ) I have a situation . I need to speak to Control now . Two minutes , no more , then . You 're ... You 're ... You 're English ? I ... I ... I don 't ... You 're with them ? ! Stay quiet if you want to live . Is your name even Anya ? Oh , God . Oh , God . The baby ... Is there ... ? No , no , but there were scans . - I saw scans ... - You speak again , I will fire this into your fucking face . Understand ? Oh , for fuck 's sake ! YOU OK ? Is she ... ? We need to go . How 's it going ? I think I 've found him . It 's the minutes of a defence department meeting in 1976 , something called the Committee of Genetic Discovery . Now , the document 's redacted , the only information is formal stuff , like time and place and the names of those attending . None of those names are Letan , but in the footnotes ... a comment attributed to Letan . They changed his name on all official documentation , but they missed the footnote . So Letan was there . He 's one of these people . Mm-hm . All we need to do is pull up their photos . Wilson you 've just found Mr Rabbit . WILSON : There were 18 on the committee . Of those , 14 were men . Six are dead , one 's in a nursing home , leaving these seven . One of them 's Letan . One of them 's Mr Rabbit . JESSICA : Do you recognise any of these men ? No . None . Do you ? So , what do we do ? We kill them . All of them . WILSON : Are you serious ? One of them is Mr Rabbit . BECKY : But six of them aren 't ! It 's called collateral damage . It 's called psychopathy . You can 't just kill them all ! I mean ... where are they ? How long will that take ? JESSICA : So we make a start . Jessica , I need to tell you , you 're too emotionally involved in all this . Excuse me ? I 've read the manuscript . OK ? I know what he did to you . But this weird , freaky , slightly sociopathic Oedipal thing you 've got going on is putting us all in danger . I swear to Christ , if you don 't stop , if you don 't shut your fucking mouth ... - He 's with them ! - No , no , no , Alice ! No , no , it 's OK ! It 's all right ! Fuck , Ian , you brought him here ? ! M-My name is Michael Dugdale . I 'm with the Department of Health . Good . That 'll help you once I 've cut your fucking face off ! I know where the vaccine is . Th ... They 're releasing it tomorrow . The whole thing is going out overnight . Tomorrow morning , it 'll start going into people 's arms , and there is such a lot of it . There 's 64 million shots . Why have you got a picture of him ? Which one ? That ... That 's Conran Letts ' assistant . He 's the man running Corvadt . ( BUZZER , DOOR OPENS ) Only one number to go , Grant . If I remember ... can I go home , please ? Absolutely . Of course you can . Jessica , it 's broad daylight . You can 't just go in and whack him . Give me my gun . - And what about the warehouse ? - The vaccine is going out tonight . We really need to do something . What is the matter with you people ? How many times do I have to tell you this all stops when he dies ? For God 's sake , this is not what you would normally do . You would at least wait until dark . Give me my gun . My knife can be opening your throat very easily . I don 't think you 'd do that . - Ian ... ? - Want to find out ? ALICE : Guys ? I think there 's something you should see . Really . You should really see this . What is it ? BECKY : It 's a molecule . It 's Janus . This is what they 've been looking for . WILSON : The vaccine is a test , to see if it works . But this ... is the real thing . This is the real Janus . You did well to find all this . You 're very clever . Don 't patronise me . I like jigsaws . I ... I 'm sorry about Grant . I ... I-I thought I was protecting my family . My wife and I we wanted a child very badly . And we thought we had one . We had been trying for a very long time . IVF ? My mum said she was going to do that before I was born . Then I suddenly happened . She said I was a miracle . Little Mary Miracle , she called me . It annoyed me . They shot her . I saw it . Would ... Would you like to talk about it ? So he experimented on you ? Carvel ? It 's in the manuscript . In the published version , the devil imprisons me . But in the manuscript , it 's my father holding me , like all the others , to use for experiments . I was hardly a living thing as far as they were concerned . They both deserve death . And you think this is going to make you feel better ? Yeah . Yeah , I do , actually . ( sue seas ) Who have we got it going to ? 46 scientists , two Nobel laureates , nine politicians , several police forces and ... a shed load of journalists . So this is it . We press that button and and everything 's out there . All of it . Listen , Ian do you think this is right ? I mean , Janus is the biggest thing in history , ever . And ... we 're here , at the centre of it . What are you talking about ? There 's a future coming where billions of us are going to be born into poverty . And we 're going to murder each other in war for water , food and oil . That 's coming . Maybe in our lifetime . The Network 's the enemy . But what if the enemy 's right ? Press the button , Wilson . They might think it 's a hoax . Do you think they 'll take it seriously ? Yeah . At least , they will when we burn the warehouse to the ground . I downloaded some blueprints . A map of the Corvadt building , showing the office . I want to go with you . I 'm not going to be much good lugging cans of petrol round in a warehouse . Look they killed my dad , Jessica . They destroyed my life , too . You ready , then ? You 're very brave . But try not to look so scared . Right . Right , just hang it there . See ? Don 't get the gun out until you get to the video room . Then you make him disable all relays . OK ? And , er , what if he doesn 't do what I say ? Well , you hit him with the gun . What , like , with the fat end ? Yeah . The fat end . Thank you . All right ? - OK . - Thank you . ( ALL SCREAM ) Right , I 've seen one of these before . They 're based on the Wiegand protocol , which is actually quite sloppy . Now , if we can access the reader , then maybe we can bar ... ( BUZZER , DOOR OPENS ) Or , yeah , we could just do that . I don 't get why there 's no guards . I don 't get it . You didn 't send the e-mail . I freed Letts . And I pushed the knife into my own stomach because they are right . Just give me the manuscript . ( BUZZER , DOOR OPENS ) This isn 't right . This is just cohesin , unmodified . That 's the number , mate . That is the one , I swear . But I got a number wrong when I drew it , so I changed that . Look . Which one ? - Which one 's wrong ? - That one . Look . We can 't be the people that destroys humanity 's chance at life . We can 't . I 'm not giving it to you . Jessica , please don 't . Please don 't . ( DEEP VOICE ) S-Stand down , Alexi . Jessica ... This is my dad . It 's all I 've got . I 'm not giving him to you . Please ... ( LIFT BELL PINGS ) Are you all right ? ( GASPS AND GROANS ) Grant ? Have you seen this man ? He 's dead . I killed him , Jessica . Come on . What about Wilson ? What about Wilson ? ( FOOTSTEPS APPROACH ) ( BECKY GASPS ) - Is this all of them ? - It is . That was all we were told . Are you sure ? I don 't want any nasty surprises . Jessica Hyde , for example . She 's not with these . ( MUFFLED WHIMPERING ) Please ... Alice ... - What ? - The ... The girl . Don 't make her see . Yes , of course . Alice , is it ? Mm-hm . Now , what I want you to do is to pop in there , close your eyes very tight and count to 99 . Will you do that for me ? And , Alice , it 's very important that you don 't run or hide , OK ? Good girl . ( BECKY WHIMPERS ) You ... You 're not going to kill us ? Why would I kill you ? - But you sent Alice in ... - She 's 12 ! Christ , Ian , what do I have to do to convince you people I 'm on your fucking side ? We thought you were dead ! Well , apparently I 'm not . Now , we haven 't much time . I understand you have petrol ? Grant ! Where 's Wilson ? Fuck ... ( BIRDSONG ) All right , there , shithead let 's give it a go . No-one 's come . They know we 're here and they must know we did it , but no-one 's come for us . We 're going to Fortingall . The Highlands of Scotland . We 're catching a train to Glasgow . - Bit remote , isn 't it ? - Yeah . Milner said to give it a month before returning . We 're pretending it 's a holiday . That 's how long she reckons they 'll need to mop up everyone else , if she has the manuscript . We have to give it to her . Jessica ? She needs it to end all this . So , what ? Alice is going with him ? Yeah . If she wants to . Because she 's alone . They want a child . Yeah , but he 's a cock . I don 't reckon she 'll go with him . Are you all right to come with us ? Just until we get all this sorted and get you back to your mum ? I don 't reckon she 'll go with him . Yeah , it 's probably for the best . ( GRANT SIGHS ) You going with that dickhead ? I 'll miss you , twat . ( KISS ) ( STIFLED SOB ) Jessica ... it is so good to meet you . It 's fine . I 'll take you through . I promise you , it 'll be fine . It 's in there ? The last thing we want is for what 's in that manuscript to become public knowledge . This way I can use it then destroy it . Jessica ... it needs to be like this . I 'm just going to get the tickets , right ? Wait here . I 'll get us a secure room . When you 're ready , you can show me . Does that sound OK ? Do you need anything ? - Tea , or ... ? - No . Thank you . ( GASPS ) Becky ... Becky ! Becky ! Help ! Jesus Christ ! She just started . I don 't know what happened . - She just started ... - Becky ! Is she OK ? Becky ? Becky ! Are you all right ? Is your head all right ? Did you bang your head ? Did I fit ? Was that a fit ? Did I fit , Ian ? ( SOBS ) Shh ... - Ian ... - We 'll get you some help . All right ? Can I have some water , please ? Please ... Sit with her . Don 't leave her . Are you all right ? Ta , pal . ( INDISTINCT VOICES ) ( VOICES CONTINUE ) - JESSICA : My dad wrote it down . - MILNER : It is so good to meet you . JESSICA : People always let you down . MILNER : This way I can use it ... ARBY : It 's called tonalite gneiss . BECKY : Where did you get that ? ARBY : From a rock plateau in Canada . He used to say , " This rock gives you permission to do anything . " KAN : He 's Mr Rabbit . WILSON : Are you sure you don 't remember the name of Mr Rabbit ? JESSICA : This all stops when he dies . - IAN : Who 's Mr Rabbit ? - JESSICA : I have no idea . WILSON : There were 78 an the committee . Of those , 74 were men . JESSICA : He 3 one of these people . All we need to do is pull out their photos . Do you recognise any of these men ? - WILSON : One of them 's Mr Rabbit . - JESSICA : I have no idea . MILNER : There 's a story about how he got his name . He was playing everyone against each other . THE TRAMP : She 's like us . Works in secret , trusts no-one . KAN : Who 's Mr Rabbit ? THE TRAMP : Milner . Her name 's Milner ... Stop ! Oh , our train is leaving . Right , go and find Ian . - But he said to stay with you . - Quick ! Quick , or we 'll miss it ! Becky says the train 's leaving now . What ? It 's not for another ten ... Stay here . Don 't move. just stay here ! ( WHISTLE BLOWS ) MILNER : You can go . Who did Grant kill ? A man so dedicated to the cause that he carved lines into his own flesh to act as cover . That 's how important this is , Jessica . But you helped burn the warehouse . The vaccine ... you destroyed it . The vaccine may well have worked . It may not have . We never had the genius of your father . Once I found out that he had finished Janus , I knew that was all that mattered . His work , Jessica . Yeah , well , fuck you . Fuck both of you . It 's over . I burned it . I destroyed your work . Janus is gone ! That ? That 's just a bunch of old drawings done by a crazy man . I only wanted that because I knew you 'd be the one bringing it . - ( GUNSHOT ) - ( CRIES OUT ) Sorry . I don 't want you jumping . From the moment you were born , he just fell in love . He considered you his greatest achievement . And that 's where he hid Janus . It 's in me ? You should be happy . Isn 't that what you 've always wanted , Daddy 's love ? Daddy loved you so much he hid the most important thing the world has ever known ... in you . We 'd better get started , you and I. We have so much to do .

 They are coming . Who 's coming ? Our world is being taken over by an advanced species of humans we call " Observers . " Bite my hand , and I will put you down . I am Dr. Walter Bishop . I had a plan to fight back . They weren 't all bad . One of them tried to help us . He was called September . Before we could strike , we were forced to Amber ourselves . 20 years later , some of our team were found . What year is it ? 2036 . Do you know me ? I 've been stuck in that Amber for over 20 years . You barely look old enough ... Henrietta ? Hi , Dad . The battle to save mankind is about to begin . Olivia . It 's okay . She 's just resting . And where 's my little girl ? No children were brought in . She was with us . Where are they keeping the kids ? Etta ! Etta ! Dad ? You all right ? Yeah , I 'm all right . I was just checking up on you . What time is it ? It 's around 7 : 00 . I made some tea . And I found these in the fridge . They 're called egg sticks . My God . What is that - punishment food ? Welcome to 2036 . The word " naugahyde " not found . Naugahyde was a very popular premium pleather . American patents ... Peter , you let me oversleep . We should be on our way by now to find Olivia . Nobody wants to find Olivia more than I do , but you 're gonna need some pants , Walter . I 'm aware I 'm not wearing pants , Peter . I 'm not an idiot . The last time I spoke to her , she was in that location - Columbus Circle , 2015 . She was in New York ? She called me the day she disappeared . I could hardly hear her . The line went dead . Do you understand that conversation was 21 years ago ? She could be anywhere now , in this city or not . She had a piece of the puzzle ... A crucial piece . This is just one part . What I sent her to get will unlock the whole . Unlock the whole what ? Plan to defeat the Observers , of course . September and I worked on the plan he provided in a unique way . After we completed each component , the information was scrambled in my mind as a precaution against being read . He told me that when the time came to implement the plan , I had to retrieve something from Grand Central Station and that then all would be clear . And that 's what I sent Olivia to get . She was on her way back when she vanished . She never returned . A few days later , I Ambered us . Good God . What 's that ? It 's an egg stick . What a miserable future . Aspen , help me find my shoes . There 's no time to waste . We have to believe she 's still alive . I know you 're doubting that right now . How could you know that ? 'Cause how could she be , after all these years ? What are the odds of getting all of us back ? If she 's still alive , Henrietta , we 're gonna find her . So this is what 's left of Columbus Circle . A travesty ... a travesty . What did they do to the park ? They paved it to build machines that pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere . Why ? There 's one on every continent . The air here , it 's too oxygen-rich for them . A few more years , and the effects will be irreversible . It 'll reduce the average non-Observer lifespan to somewhere around 45 . Well , somewhere around here she called me . She was running . That much I could ascertain , and then the connection was suddenly cut . Walter . Yes , Olivia could be trapped in there . We had already discussed the possibility of using Amber as a last resort should we be at risk of getting caught by the Observers . I 'd already given her an ambering device . I would have given one to you too if you hadn 't abandoned us . Walter . He didn 't mean it . Sure he did . Oh , no . What are all those holes ? Everyone 's gone . Fourth gen Amber removal - they were taken recently . So the Observers have Olivia ? No . Amber gypsies . What on earth are Amber gypsies ? Oh , my . The black market thrives here . Hello , there . I fell in love in Japan once . I almost married her . Come on , Walter . Okay , go down three halls - the first area on your right . You 're not coming ? Fringe Division shakes these guys down all the time . Someone will recognize me . Walnuts ? Deal closer . That 's almost $ 3,000 . If they tell you any different , they 're trying to rip you off . Excuse me . We 're looking for someone who was cut out of Amber not far from here . We 're not loyalists ... just concerned family members . Freshest cuts are on the left . I still can 't believe my eyes - what you 've grown into . Of course , you must understand for me it 's only two months ago that I took you to the pier . You loved the horses . Carousel . You remember ? No . I wish I did . It 's just what they call them , right-carousels ? They used to anyway . To me , you will forever be a little girl . The woman I 'm looking for - she 's a blonde . So 's my sister . Those are the cuts . This one would be hard to forget . Yeah . Information 's expensive . She would have had an electronic device in her hand . Huh . Late 20s , black leather jacket ? Yeah . She was sold . She was sold ? Sold to who ? Your stage is waiting for you , Maverick . You selling tickets ? No , but you 're buying one . I am ? Yes , indeed . You being an understanding soul . And one that don 't like violence . Let 's get out of here , Maverick . You don 't want any trouble . You 're right , Doc , not that kind . This apartment is sanctioned . I have invoked native rights , statute 23 " D. " Go away . Markham ? Markham is dead . He died a hero 's death . People were sad . He gave his life saving a bus full of small children and - you 're alive . Where is she ? All of you . Where is she ? Why haven 't you aged ? How did you not age ? We know you bought her . I love her ... from the first time she came into my bookstore . I never meant her any harm . How 'd you get her in here ? You had to use a dolly or something . It 's not supposed to happen this way . She 's supposed to wake up and see me as her savior , when I figure out exactly how to wake her up . A gurney . Peter , here . This place is a treasure trove of literature . She 's supposed to overlook my height issue and realize that I 'm really good for her and that I love her . I have gone into substantial debt over this . You have something to report ? I got some information to sell . Is it level four ? Yeah , it 's good . Some people I saw on reward wire . I want three times the vouchers for my loyalty . Proceed . What 's taking Walter so long ? I want to get her out of here . I 'll go check . Isaac Asimov . May I ? Who cares ? I tried my hand at science-fiction writing once . Once . Resistance is futile . I feel like I 've heard that before . Walter , run . Please don 't kill me . Please don 't kill me . Please don 't kill me . Etta . Are you okay ? I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Where 's Walter ? He should be here . Go . Go , go . What are we gonna do about Walter ? Don 't move ! Okay , you ready ? Three , two , one . Olivia . Olivia , breathe . Breathe . You 're okay . You 're okay . Breathe , Olivia . Breathe . Breathe . There you go . Oh , Peter . Where am I ? You 're in the year 2036 . I ambered myself . I know you did . We all did . I found her . More to the point , she found us . Olivia , I want you to meet Etta . Kiddo , come meet your mom . Hi , Mama . You 're beautiful . So are you . The last time I saw you , you were three years old . All this time I thought I was four . No , you were three years , one month , and five days . There was not one moment that I didn 't think about you . Where 's Walter ? He was captured this morning . By Observers . Walter had worked out a plan to defeat the Observers - one that he worked out with September . He said that you had something he needed , something you were gonna give him . From Grand Central Station . Here . What is it ? I don 't know . I was on my way to Walter when I triggered the ambering device . So where did they take Walter ? We 're working on that . We have been looking for you ... and your friends . I am very interested in you . I don 't know why you 're alive . ♪ ♪ Ah , you 're trying to think of music . ♪ ♪ You miss music . There 's not a lot of it here . We tolerate it . But it 's merely tones , rhythms , and harmonic vibrations . I don 't understand . Mostly it amazes me . Music helps you shift perspective , to see things differently if you need to . See things ? Like hope ? Yeah . Very much like that . But there is no hope ... for you . Nothing grows from scorched earth . You seem much more interesting as a human being than as a vegetable . But , quite frankly , all things being equal , I don 't mind which one you end up . The choice is yours . Wait here . Anil ? Etta . What happened ? Elias was shot this afternoon coming out of the square . I need your help . We didn 't save the world . Not even by half . She 's still trying , though . How long do you think it 's been since they made one of these ? 'Cause I could sure use one right now . I never thought I 'd see you again , Olivia . I know what you thought of me when I wouldn 't leave Boston to come to New York with you ... When I left you alone . No , Peter , we lost our child . And ... in the grief , we just ... weren 't able or were incapable of - of being what we needed to be for each other . And that was all it was . You were stronger than me . You could do something that I couldn 't do . You saw that the world needed us , and you went to help . And I just - I didn 't have the will to give up searching for this - this perfect little soul that we made . Out here for all these years ... Fighting for these people , defending them . And at the moment that she needed her father to protect her , I couldn 't do it . And I wanted more than anything for that not to be true . And in the state of mind that I was in ... that meant at all costs ... including us . Come with me . This is Anil . It 's an honor to meet you . What we have here is a Transilience Thought Unifier , Model-11 . So what 's it do ? Turn it on . Can we access its information ? No , that 's not how it works . It accesses your information . What do you mean ? It retrieves specifically marked thoughts in your mind and unifies them . For what purpose ? To keep them hidden from prying eyes until you want to access them . Exactly . But it doesn 't seem to work any longer . That 's what Walter meant . " All become clear " when he gets this . It has to be the plan . It was fragmented and hidden on Walter 's hard drive by September . You guys . We found Walter . This is from across the street from where Dr. Bishop was taken . We 'll track him with traffic cameras . This is two blocks from here . Can you do that across the entire city ? I haven 't lost many people doing this , but I have lost some , so no promises . This thing is crucial to Walter 's plan . But it is conceivable he could give them that information . If he hasn 't already . And who 's to say what else ? Does he know you 're a Fringe Agent ? Who freed you and your team from the Amber ? Why did they free you ? What do they expect to get from you ? You 're partitioned . Someone gave you information out of sequence . They did this on purpose ... to protect something . Aaah ! How did you learn to fragment your thoughts like that ? Was it an " Observer , " as you call us , who partitioned you ? No one else would know how to do that . The ideas are disparate but part of a whole . Put them together for me , please . Put them together for me . What plan ? To defeat us ? What are the elements of this plan ? Let me organize them for you , please . You are fighting much more than I would have thought possible . Walter Bishop , if only I had a unifier , I could unify these thoughts . I could go through the trouble to get one , but it would take weeks to break the biology key specific to your encryption . But ... that doesn 't mean I will not get the information out . It will make it harder to get to it , but it will come out . Who 's the little girl ? Who 's the little blonde girl ? She 's helping you - the little blonde girl . How can this small child be helping you ? What is her name ? She 's amazing , Peter . There 's just so many things that I want to tell her and so many things that I want to ask her . You will . It 's like living this beautiful dream ... inside of a horrible nightmare . Got him . That 's the Napean Building . They took it over a couple years ago . It had to be that one . Anyone ever gotten in there ? No , but ... What ? We 've been working on this tech . Anil , it 's not perfected yet . But it could work . So what is it ? It 's tech which will make our bodies appear dead - impossible for the baldies to detect any life force . But we 've been saving it , because after we use it once , they know we 'll have it . Sort of like reusing the Trojan horse . We could kill hundreds of them with this tactic . We could get in anywhere , including their headquarters . Why save one man with this ? The future . I believe that whatever his plan is to defeat the Observers , it will work . Please . Killing our enemies is one thing . Saving the world is another . Okay . Let 's do this . Come with me . Windmark wanted the bodies of these resistance fighters brought in . I was wondering where you 've been . It 's always brighter when you 're here . You hear what happened ? What ? I was raised to level six . Did I tell you ? That 's great . Hey , if I share something , you promise you won 't tell ? Yeah . They found Agent Foster in Amber . Your superior was a double agent . He was working with the resistance . He was with someone named William Bell . What did they do with him ? That 's above my pay grade . Ask Windmark yourself . He 'll certainly want to talk to you about it . These physics in your mind , they are also above your comprehension . What are the stones utilized for ? I don 't ... You must try . What are the stones ? What is your plan to defeat us ? Let down the walls . I am your ally . Nice watch . And I want his boots too . Hey . What happened to him ? Occupational hazard . That 's my girl . What , they need this to breathe ? Apparently . This one 's only temporary . They 're building a more permanent one in Central Park . They don 't like clean air . All right , it 's always the red wire . Unless it 's the white wire . That did it . Let 's go . Clearly , we are done here . I must say , your brain will make an excellent specimen . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Walter . Walter . Air control malfunction . Walter . Is he okay ? I don 't know . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Air control malfunction . Over here . Peter . To the front gate ! Oh , my God , Walter . Afro ... Do you have any music ? Hello , little girl . Olivia . I am so happy you 're alive . Walter , do you recognize this ? It 's what September wanted you to find . It 's called a Thought Unifier . Or at least it was . This one 's long since dead . He must have designed it specifically for you . What 's it used for ? Well , it 's meant to collect and make sense of the scrambled plan that September put in your mind . What plan ? You told us that you knew all the parts of the plan , all the elements . You just weren 't sure what they were supposed to be used for . Walter , do you remember this ? Whose hand is that ? It 's William Bell 's hand . You 're out of your mind . Why would we have William Bell 's hand ? You said we needed his handprint so we could get access to one of his storage facilities . I don 't remember it . I don 't remember any of it . I 've failed myself , and I 've failed the world . What is wrong with me ? What has happened to - Walter . I can 't do it . I can 't even recognize myself . It 's like there 's nothing left to unify . All the parts are gone . Or they took them . It 's more likely they were destroyed when he was fighting it . Will they ever heal ? No . The plan is gone .

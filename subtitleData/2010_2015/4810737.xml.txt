 ( male announcer ) PREVIOUSLY ON FRINGE ... WHAT DID THEY DO TO THE PARK ? ( Etta ) THEY PAVED IT TO BUILD MACHINES THAT PUMP CARBON MONOXIDE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE . WHY ? E AIR HERE , IT 'S TOO OXYGEN-RICH FOR THEM . A FEW MORE YEARS , AND THE EFFECTS WILL BE IRREVERSIBLE . I WANT YOU TO MEET ETTA . HI , MOM . WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO DEFEAT US ? WHO 'S THE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL ? SHE 'S HELPING YOU . [ grunts ] YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN TO GIVE UP . [ gunshot ] NO , NO , NO , NO ! NO ! NO , NO , NO ! I CAN 'T LOSE YOU , NOT AGAIN . [ sighs ] [ click ] THAT 'S MY GIRL . I FELL ASLEEP . I KEEP WAKING UP AND THINKING THAT I 'M DREAMING THIS TERRIBLE THING AND THEN I REALIZE THAT IT 'S NOT A DREAM . YEAH . I KNOW . WHY WOULD WE GET HER BACK JUST TO LOSE HER AGAIN ? [ overlapping street chatter ] WHAT IS THAT ? HEY , YOU FEEL THAT ? YEAH . WHERE 'S IT COMING FROM ? WHOA ! GET OFF THE STREET ! STORM COMING IN OR SOMETHING ? [ overlapping commotion ] [ device beeps , hums ] [ beeping ] INTEGRITY IS STABLE . PREPARE FOR TRANSPORT . COME ON THROUGH ! [ mysterious music ] ♪ ♪ COME ON , WALTER . IT 'S TIME TO GO . IT 'S THIS ONE . MAY I KEEP THIS ? ETTA 'S PERFUME . IT 'S THE ONE SHE LIKED . IT REMINDS ME OF HER . OH , MY MEMORY , IT FAILS ME . BUT MY SENSE OF SMELL HELPS ME REMEMBER . et ) IT 'S YOURS . THANK YOU . [ phone ringing ] HEY , ASTRID . EVERYTHING OKAY ? HEY . I 'VE RAN INTO A BIT OF A FIRE HAZARD , SO THERE 'S NO TAPE YET . ATS THAT ? ( Astrid ) YOU SEE THAT WHITE TUBY THING ? THAT IS A PROPANE TANK FOR WALTER 'S HIBACHI . AND THAT SEE-THROUGH BLOB OVER THERE , THAT IS A GALLON OF ETHANOL . ABNER , WHY DID YOU LEAVE THE PROPANE TANK THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE ? SOMEONE WANTED TO COOK BRATWURST . WHY T ETHANOL THERE AND NOT IN THE CUPBOARD ? BECAUSE SOMEONE WANTED TO USE THE ETHANOL TO CLEAN THE HIBACHI BEFORE THEY COOKED THE BRATWURST . AT THIS RATE , WE WON 'T GET ANOTHER TAPE UNTIL WEDNESDAY . MORE LIKE THURSDAY . [ phone ringing ] WELL , THANK YOU , DEAR . TRY AND GO AS FAST AS YOU CAN . THAT 'S ETTA 'S PHONE . [ phone continues ringing ] OLIVIA . I DIDN 'T KNOW IF YOU 'D ANSWER . ANIL . I DIDN 'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO REACH YOU . I TOOK A CHANCE . I UNDERSTAND . OLIVIA , IT 'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MEET . I 'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS . SHE WAS SPECIAL . NOT JUST TO ME , BUT TO THE MOVEMENT . I HOPE SOMEDAY YOU 'LL UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH . WHAT ON EARTH CAUSED THIS ? WELL , WE BELIEVE IT 'S THE RESULT OF THE BALDIES OPENING A SHIPPING LANE ... FROM THE FUTURE . A WORMHOLE . THE REPORTS WE HEARD SAY THAT IT STARTED WITH STRANGE STATIC ELECTRICITY IN THE AIR . WHAT ARE THEY SHIPPING FROM THE FUTURE ? THEY 'RE BRINGING BACK COMPONENTS FOR THE AIR-DEGRADATION SYSTEM THAT THEY 'RE BUILDING IN CENTRAL PARK . SIMILAR BURN RADIUSES WERE REPORTED IN FRANCE AND EGYPT , WHERE THE OTHER AIR-DEGRADATION SYSTEMS WERE BUILT . IF THEY FINISH THIS MACHINE , THEIR AIR QUALITY MANIPULATION WILL BE COMPLETE ON ALL CONTINENTS . AND OUR LIFESPAN WILL BE REDUCED TO 45 YEARS . WE KNOW THAT ALREADY . ETTA TOLD US . IF THE PATTERN OF WHAT HAPPENED OVERSEAS HOLDS , THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF MANY MORE SHIPMENTS . THE RESISTANCE WANTS TO DESTROY THE NEXT ONE WHEN IT COMES . I WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR LANGUAGE . IF WE 'RE GONNA SABOTAGE A SHIPMENT , WE NEED TO KNOW WHEN IT COMES , AND WE 'RE HOPING THE ANSWER IS IN THAT BOOK . WELL , I 'LL SEE WHAT ASTRID CAN MAKE OF IT . WHERE DID YOU GET IT ? IT CAME AS A PACKAGE DEAL . [ phone ringing ] NIEMANN . OKAY , SHOW THEM OUR VISITOR . YOU CAPTURED AN OBSERVER ? GOOD WORK . WE CAUGHT HIM HERE YESTERDAY . HE WAS WALKING AROUND TAKING MEASUREMENTS . THEN THIS MORNING , THIS HAPPENED . ( Olivia ) WELL , DID YOU GET ANY INFORMATION FROM HIM ? ( Anil ) NO . WHAT IS IT , PETER ? WHATEVER HAPPENED , IT STARTED HERE . SOMETHING INCREDIBLY POWERFUL WAS SITTING HERE . A SQUARE . A CUBE . YEAH , THE OBSERVER WE CAUGHT YESTERDAY ... HE HAD TECH ON HIM . IT WAS A CUBEERVER ABOUT THAT SIZE.DAY ... IT HAD PARTS , AND IT CAME IN A CASE . I THINK THAT CUBE IS THE TECH THAT OPENS THE DOOR . CAN WE GET THE ONE THAT YOU HAVE ? WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH IT ? I 'M THINKING BIGGER THAN JUST ONE SHIPMENT . I WANNA HIT ' EM HARDER . IF THE CUBE IS WHAT OPENS THE DOOR , MAYBE IT 'S POWERFUL ENOUGH TO DESTROY IT . WHY STOP AT ONE SHIPMENT IF WE CAN DESTROY THE ENTIRE CORRIDOR ? WELL , HOW WOULD WE DO THAT ? I DON 'T KNOW . BUT LOOK AT THE DESTRUCTION THAT IT CAUSES . YOU 'RE TALKING ABOUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY . ( Anil ) WE DON 'T UNDERSTAND THIS . WE DON 'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS . NOT YET . WALTER . ANIL IS RIGHT . WE DON 'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE 'RE DEALING WITH HERE . I 'VE MADE UP MY MIND . DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING I COULD E TO TAKE SAMPLES OF THE CARBON ? YEAH . I HAVE A COLLECTION KIT IN THE VAN . I 'LL GET IT . [ device beeping ] BEFORE YOU GO ON A JOURNEY OF REVENGE , DIG TWO GRAVES . I 'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT BEING DESTROYED . IT 'S THE OBSERVERS WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED . IF WE 'RE GONNA TAKE OUT THIS PORTAL , WE 'RE GONNA NEED THAT CUBE . [ phone beeps ] BRING THE CUBE . COPY THAT . [ clatter ] SON OF A BITCH ! [ exhales ] IF THIS REALLY IS A SHIPPING MANIFEST , THEN I 'M EXPECTING DATES , TIMES . I CAN 'T EVEN DIFFERENTIATE WHICH OF THESE SYMBOLS ARE LETTERS OR NUMBERS . THIS DECRYPTION PROGRAM HAS BEEN RUNNING FOR OVER AN HOUR . I CAN DO THIS , YOU KNOW ? IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE IF YOU ARE OVERWHELMED . I MEAN , YOU 'RE IN SHOCK . I THINK IT 'S BEST IF I JUST FOCUS . [ sighs ] ( Astrid ) OH , MY GOD . WHAT ? I 'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS ALL WRONG . WHAT DO YOSE A " B. " TO US , IT 'S A " B. " BUTH DON 'T THINK LIKE US . TO THEM , MAYBE THIS IS A " B " AND A " C " AND AN 8 AND A 6 AND A 56 . THIS PGRAM IS LOOKING FOR A ONE-TO-ONE CORRELATION . ANY OF THESE SYMBOLS COULD HAV MANY DIFFERENT MEANINGS , SO ... FOR EVERY PAGE , 200 SYMBOL - IT 'S JUST TOO LARG THERE 'S TOO MANYPOIBILITIES . WE HAVE TO RUN MULTIPLE DECRYPTION PROGRAMS SIMULTANEOUSLY . I NEED MORE COMPUTING POWER . A LOT MORE . OKAY , I 'M GONNA CALL ANIL . PETER . THE AMOUNT OF POWER COMING OFF THIS THING IS OFF THE CHARTS , AND IT 'S NOT EVEN TURNED ON . IT 'S A STRANGE ALLOY , BUT NO MAGNETIC PROPERTIES . THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR CERTAIN ... IS THAT IT HAS THE ABILITY TO BLOW US TO KINGDOM COME . WE DON 'T EVEN KNOW IF WE 'RE PUTTING TETHER RIGHT . IF YOU ARE STILL INTENT ON DOING THIS , I BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE TO DESTROY THE SHIPPING CORRIDOR . BUT IT IS EXTREMELY NGOUS . THINK OF EVERYTHING ON TOP OF THIS SHEET AS THE FUTURE , WHERE THEY ARE . WHEN THE OBSERVERS TRANSPORT A SHIPMENT FROM THEIR FUTURE TO OUR PRESENT , THEY DROP THEM DOWN A WORMHOLE THAT THEY CREATED . BECAUSE THE WORMHOLE IS STABLE AT BOTH ENDS , MATTER AND ENERGY IN THEIR FUTURE IS UNAFFECTED . LIFE GOES ON UNDISTURBED . HOWEVER ... IF WE WERE TO COLLAPSE OUR END , SEALING IT OFF ... EVERYTHING THEY PUT DOWN THE WORMHOLE ... WILL JUST WEIGHT IT DOWN . THE RESULT IS LIKE A VACUUM , SUCKING ALL MATTER AND ENERGY INTO ITSELF , CONSUMING IT . YOU WANNA TURNHE WORMHOLE INTO A BLACK HOLE . YES . SO WE COLLAPSE THE WORMHOLE ON OUR SIDE , AND ALL THAT 'S LEFT ON THEIR SIDE IS A BLACK HOLE AND A HELL OF A LOT OF DESTRUCTION . EXCELLENT , WALTER . SO HOW WOULD WE DO THAT ? WE 'D NEED TO USE- - ANTI-MATTER . THE BATONS THAT WE GOT IN ETTA 'S APARTMENT . ALL RIGHT . I 'D STILL NEED TO GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO THROW ONE INTO THE CORRIDOR . ( Olivia ) THAT 'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY . WHEN THE SHIPMENT ARRIVES , IT 'S GONNA BE CRAWLING WITH OBSERVERS AND ARMED LOYALISTS WAITING FOR IT . THAT 'S WHERE THE CUBE COMES IN . DO YOU REMEMBER THE ELECTRIC SWIRLS OF STATIC ELECTRICITY THAT WERE REPORTED BEFORE THE CORRIDOR OPENED ? IMAGINE THEY 'RE LIKE A TELEPHONE RINGING . LIKE A CALL FROM THE FUTURE . THE CUBE ANSWERS THAT CALL AND THE CORRIDOR IS OPENED . SO WE JUST HAVE TO ANSWER THE CALL FIRST . BUT WE HAVEN 'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO TURN THE CUBE ON . THE OBSERVER THAT ANIL CAPTURED . HE CERTAINLY KNOWS HOW TO MAKE IT WORK . ANIL COULDN 'T GET THE OBSERVER TO MAKE HEADS OR TAILS OF IT EITHER . WELL , ANIL HAS HISAY OF DOI TNGS , AND I HAVE MINE . NOW PETER , YOU 'RE SURE ABOUT THIS ? I 'M SURE WE CAN 'T LET ' EM FINISH THE AIR-DEGRADATION SYSTEM . WELL , I KNOW THAT . BUT ANIL SAID THAT IT WOULD TAKE THEM SOME TIME . WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW . YEAH , BUT WHAT ABOUT WALTER 'S PLAN ? WE HAVE A MISSION . THIS COULD PUT THAT IN JEOPARDY . I 'M NOT DOUBTI WALTER 'S PLAN . T WHAT DO WE HAVE ? PIECES WE DON 'T KNOW HOW TO PUT TOGETHER . A SCROLL WITH PHYSICS WE CAN 'T DECIPHER , A THOUGHT UNIFIER THAT DOESN 'T WORK , AND A BOX OF ROCKS FROM A MINE . THAT 'S WHAT OUR DAUGHTER DI F SO FA IF WE CAN DO THIS , WE HAVE SOMETHING TANGIBLE- - A REAL VICTORY . ( Peter ) IT COULD TE EM YEARS TO RECOVER . OKAY , I WANNA HURT THEM TOO . SO THEN WHAT IS IT ? WHAT , OLIVIA ? ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME ? YES . YES , I AM . I 'M AFRAID . ( Peter ) NOTHING 'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME . I CAN DO THIS . WE CAN DO THIS . OUR DAUGHTER DEDICATED HER LIFE TO FREEING US . AND NOW , WE 'RE GONNA DEDICATE OURS TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT MEANS SOMETHING . WHEN WE WIN , WHEN WE BEAT THEM , I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT ETTA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORLD BEING SAVED . I WANT THAT TOO . THEN WE HAVE TO DO THIS . AND WE CAN , OLIVIA . TOGETHER . WISH ME LU . HEY . WHAT 'S THE CONCOCTION ? A WEE BIT OF THIS , A WEE BIT OF THAT . CRYOPROTECTANTS , OSMOLYTES . SMALL MOLECULES WITHIN THEIR BLOOD PREVENTING DAMAGE TO THEIR VITAL ORGANS . COMPOUNDS THAT ACT AS NATURAL ANTIFREEZE . ANTIFREEZE ? YEAH , IT KEEPS THEM TETHERED TO THIS LOCATION . THEY 'RE ACTUALLY NOT AS HEARTY AS YOU 'D THINK . THEIR ABILITIES ARE AIDED BY TECH . YEAH , I 'VE HEARD THAT . WELL , HELLO THERE . RIGHT . LET 'S WAKE THIS BASTARD UP . GOOD MORNING , SUNSHINE . COME ON ! RISE AND SHINE ! THAT 'S IT . THAT 'S THE COLD STARE I KNOW AND LOVE . YOU DEAD FISH . THIS IS MY FRIEND . HE 'S MEANER THAN I AM . SO I GUESS YOU KNOW WHERE THAT LEAVES YOU . YOU GOOD ? GOOD . THANK YOU . YOU RECOGNIZE THIS , RIGHT ? YOU 'RE GONNA HELP ME PUT IT TOGETHER . YOU DO NOT HAVE USE FOR IT . OH , BUT I DO HAVE A USE FOR IT . I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW IT FITS TOGETHER , AND I NEED TO KNOW WHAT POWERS IT , AND I NEED TO KNOW HOW IT WORKS . TO DO THAT ... I NEED TO TURN IT ON . YOU MUST UNDERSTAND YOUR COMPATRIOTS HAVE GLEANED NO INFORMATION FROM ME . YOU WILL NOT EITHER . YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE MORE CAPABLE OF SUCCESS WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED . YOU READ ME . SEE IF YOU CAN READ MY THOUGHTS RIGHT NOW . ANYTHING ? IT 'S OKAY . I KNOW YOU KNOW . I CAN FEEL YOU BANGING AROUND INSIDE THERE . BUT IT DOESN 'T MATTER WHAT YOU FIND OUT . 'CAUSE YOU AND I BOTH KNOW ... YOU 'RE NEVER WALKING OUT OF HERE . WHATEVER THE CLOSEST THING IT IS TO FEAR THAT YOU CAN FEEL , I KNOW THAT YOU 'RE FEELING IT RIGHT NOW . YOU 'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A SKILL FOR READING PEOPLE . YOU DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DON 'T KNOW . WE 'LL SEE . [ overlapping chatter ] ( Peter ) YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THE VARIATION OF A MAGNETIC FIELD PRODUCES AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IF THE PIECES OF THE CUBE ARASSEMBLED IN THE PROPER ORDER . BUT WHAT 'S THE PROPER ORDER ? OH , THAT 'S RIGHT . YOU 'RE NOT GOING TO TELL ME . YOU ARE PLEASED WITH YOURSELF . I 'M FEELING OPTIMISTIC ... IF THAT 'S WHAT YOU MEAN . [ electricity crackles ] YOUR SKILL IS IMPRESSIVE , BUT IT IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE . YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE 'RE CAPABLE OF . I THINK OF YOU AS I WOULD AN ANT COLONY AS I PASS BY IT . I DON 'T CARE ABOUT THE WORKINGS OF THE COLONY , WHY ONE ANT IS MAD AT ANOTHER OR WHY ONE ANT WOULD KILL ANOTHER OR NOT . TO ME , IT IS INSIGNIFICANT . AND LIKE AN ANT COLONY , YOU ARE OBLIVIOUS TO YOUR LIMITATIONS . YOU THINK THE BLACK OVER YOUR HEAD IS DARK SKIES ... WHEN IT IS REALLY OUR SHOE . YOU TALK A GOOD GAME . BUT THE TRUTH IS YOU 'RE WORRIED . WALTER , I THOUGHT THAT YOU SAID IT WAS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO FREE ANOTHER TAPE . THIS TAPE WAS NEVER IN AMBER . I FOUND IT IN MY DESK . IT 'S A VIDEO OF ONE OF ETTA 'S BIRTHDAYS . IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO WATCH , BUT I BELIEVE IT 'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU AND PETER TO SEE IT . WALTER , I AM HOLDING ON BY A THREAD . YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT ? I HEARD YOU ... WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO PETER . YOU TOLD HIM THAT U WERE AFRAID . HE ASSUMED THAT YOU MEANT U WERE AFRAID FOR S FETY AND OF COURSE YOARE , BUT I THINK WE BOTH KNOW IT 'S MORE THAN THAT . YOU 'RE AFRAID THAT YOU WILL LOSE EACH OTHER AGAIN . I 'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT I SEE WHAT YOU SEE . AND THAT 'S WHY THIS PE SIMPORTANT . YOU MUST WATCH IT AND REMEMBER WHAT YOU BOTH HAD , WHAT YOU STILL ARE , AND YOU MUSTOLD ON TO THAT . YOU MUST FACE THIS PAIN TOGETHER . THE PAIN IS HER LEGACY TO YOU BOTH . IT 'S PROOF THAT SHE WAS HERE . I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS- - THIS SORT OF PAIN , AND YOU CAN 'T ESCAPE IT BY BUILDING WALLS AROUND YOUR HEART . OR BY BREAKING THE UNIVERSE . OR BY VENGEANCE . YOU LOST EACH OTR ONCE ... BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE . I CAN 'T . [ door opening ] I 'M SORRY . IT 'S OKAY . UM , WE DID IT . WE DECODED THE BOOK . IT IS A SHIPPING MANIFEST . THE NEXT SHIPMENT IS THIS AFTERNOON . ( Peter ) NOW , THIS NEXT PIECE ... IF I ATTACH THIS INCORRECTLY ... WE WILL BE OBLITERATED . BUT HOW DO I DO IT ? WHICH WAY IS THE RIGHT WAY ? FOUR POSSIBILITIES . THREE OF THEM ARE WRONG . AND I 'M RELYING ON YOU TO TELL ME . THEN YOU ARE RELYING ON A FAULTY PREMISE . I DO NOT FEAR DEATH . WHATEVER CHOICE YOU MAKE , IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE . CONSCIOUSLY , YEAH . THAT MAY BE TRUE . BUT YOUR ORIGINS ARE HUMAN . NO MATTER HOW ADVANCED YOU BECOME , YOU WILL ENDEAVOR TO STAY ALIVE AT ALL COSTS . IN EXTREME SITUATIONS , YOUR BODY WILL REACT ON A SUBCONSCIOUS , ORGANIC LEVEL . THERE ARE TELLS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND CAN 'T CONTROL . FOR INSTANCE ... GOOD NEWS ... AND YOUR PUPILS DILATE . BAD NEWS ... AND THEY CONTRACT . NOT JUST A THEORY . IN FACT , I 'M SURE OF IT . ARE YOU ? [ electricity crackles ] [ phone ringing ] HEY . ( Olivia ) THE CORRIDOR IS OPENING NEAR LEXINGTON AND 86TH TODAY . WE HAVE ABOUT 30 MINUTES . I SEE . WILL YOU BE READY ? PETER ? PETER , ARE YOU STILLHERE ? I 'M ON MY WAY . LET ' EM KNOW WE 'RE CLEAR . HOLDING POSITIONS . [ indistinct chatter ] WE HAVE TO SHUT THE WHOLE AREA DOWN . EASTBOUND AS WELL . WAIT FOR PRIMARY READING . IT 'S ACTIVATED . [ gun cocks ] [ exhales ] I HAVE NOT ACTIVATED THE STABILIZING MECHANISM . SOMETHING IS WRONG . [ grunts ] [ grunts ] [ Peter grunting ] YEAH , IT IS THAT TYPE OF GUN . [ gunshot ] [ groans ] [ wind rushing ] LET 'S GO ! LET 'S GO ! GO ! GO ! WHAT 'S WRONG ? I MEAN , WE DESTROYED IT . WE CREATED A BLACK HOLE . HOW COULD THEY RECOVER SO QUICKLY ? I CAN 'T EXPLAIN IT . IF THE CORRIDOR WERE SEALED AT THIS END , THEN A BLACK HOLE MUST HAVE MANIFESTED IN THE OTHER . THE OBSERVERS ON THAT SIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCKED INTO THE VORTEX , THEIR OPERATION CRIPPLED FOR YEARS . IT SHOULD 'VE WORKED . IT MUST 'VE WORKED . HEY , WHERE ARE YOU GOING ? TO GET ANSWERS ! PETER ! HEY , WALTER , CAN I CALL YOU BACK ? PETER ! PETER ? YOU CAN LEAVE . I 'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE . [ muffled grunts ] [ frantic breathing ] [ panting ] WHY DIDN 'T IT WORK ? YOU DON 'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DON 'T KNOW . BEFORE GOING ON A JOURNEY OF REVENGE , DIG TWO GRAVES . YOUR FRIEND WAS CORRECT . EMOTIONS GET IN THE WAY OF JUDGMENT . EMOTIONS DID NOT GET THE BETTER OF ME . I READ YOUR TELLS TO HELP ME ASSEMBLE THE DEVICE . YOUR ASSERTION REGARDING THE INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE OF THE BODY TO PHYSICAL THREAT WAS INTERESTING BUT HIGHLY ANTIQUATED . IT DOES NOT APPLY TO US . IN TRUTH , THERE WAS A FLY ON THE WINDOW . AS MY CEREBRAL CORTEX RESTED IT , THERE WAS A SMALL IRREGULARITY IN MY HEARTBEAT , 'CAUSING A SLIGHT DEREGULATION OF MY OXYGEN TO MY BRAIN WHICH IN TURN AFFECTED MY OCULOMOTOR NERVE . THIS OCULOMOTOR NERVE IS WHAT CAUSED MY PUPIL TO DILATE . THAT 'S WHAT YOU PICKED UP ON , MY OBSERVATION OF A FLY . BUT YOU ASCRIBED MEANING TO SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT THERE . YOU SAW WHAT YOU WANTED TO SEE . YOU BELIEVED WHAT YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE , BECAUSE THAT 'S WHAT YOUR EMOTIONS DO . THEY ASCRIBE MEANING TO SOMETHING THAT IS NOT THERE . THEY FOOL YOUR PERCEPTION AS TO WHAT IS REAL . NO . YOU 'RE WRONG . A DOG DOES NOT SMILE , NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOUR KIND MIGHT THINK IT DOES . YOU PUT TOGETHER THE DEVICE BECAUSE OF YOUR INTUITION AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND YOUR EXPERIENCE AS AN ENGINEER . YOU SIMPLY NEEDED CONFIDENCE , SO YOU MADE SURE YOU SAW WHAT YOU NEEDED IN MY REACTIONS . YOU BLAME US FOR HER DEATH , BUT IT IS IRRELEVANT . SHE WAS HERE , NOW SHE IS SIMPLY NOT RE . [ grunts ] DID YOU FEEL THAT ? SHE IS N SPLY GONE . SHE LL BE REMEMBERED ! UNLIKE YOU . IF I KILL YOU RIGHT NOW , NO ONE WILL REMEMBER YOU . NO ONE WILL MISS YOU . MISS ME ? YOU ARE NOTHING BUT TECH . I WOULD BE TEN TIMES WHAT YOU ARE IF I HAD THAT TECH IN MY HEAD . [ grunts ] [ tape loads into VCR ] YOU 'RE WRONG ABOUT EMOTIONS NOT BEING REAL . MY FEELINGS FOR HER ARE VERY REAL . [ shuddering ] CAN YOU FEEL THAT ? THE PAIN OF A PIECE OF YOU BEING TORN OUT ? THAT 'S THE PAIN A FATHER FEELS WHEN HE LOSES A CHILD . [ scalpel slicing ] [ groans ] ( Olia on tape ) [ indistinct ] ( Peter on tape THINK YOU CAN DO IT IN ONE AGAIN ? ( Etta on tape ) I 'M GONNA DO IT AGAIN . ( Peter ) OH , MY GOD ! YOU 'RE A PRO ! [ applause ] YOU DID IT . NO WAY . ( Peter ) TAKE THAT OUT . ( Etta ) TAKE THAT OUT AND TAKE THAT . [ Olivia and Peter talking indistinctly ] KISS MOMMY . [ laughs ] GOOD , YOUR HIGHNESS ? ( Peter ) WATCH OUT , I 'M COMING FOR YOUR CAKE ! [ Etta laughs ] ( Peter ) IF YOU 'RE GONNA OPEN A PRESENT , WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN FIRST ? [ Etta talking indistinctly ] [ pained groaning ] [ heavy breaths ] [ grunts ] [ grunting ] [ phone ringing ] HI . PETER . [ sniffles ] PETER , I WANT YOU TO COME HOME . I DON 'T NNLOSE YOU . IT 'S OKAY , OLIVIA . SHE WOULD WANT USUS TO BE TO SURVIVE THIS . I JUST--I LOVE YOU . I LOVE YOU TOO . [ wincing , grunting ]

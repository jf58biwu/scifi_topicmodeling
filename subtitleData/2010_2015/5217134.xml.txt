 Aah ! [ Groaning ] [ Footsteps ] We know from Manhattan south homicide task force the suspect is male , right-handed , Caucasian , and wears a black sports watch . We got two dead , third is critical , which makes us the lead story on every newscast in America . [ Shouting ] You see behind me the bars of Second Avenue , no less crowded than normal for a Thursday night despite growing fears about " App the ripper , " so named for his propensity to post video of his brutal killings shot from his phone . Chief of the detectives himself is walking a beat to prove the streets are safe . All three victims worked in different professions ... lawyer , doctor , Wall Street . The biblical passage in the video is about David and Goliath , so this guy must see himself as David , the hero . Ripper 's pattern is to attack the first of the month . Victim number three was two days ago . 6 : 00 news reported Vic number three is gonna pull through . So guy who says " I don 't fail " just failed . Gut says he 's going at it again . - And quickly . - East Village ? The last two locations were midtown . Yeah , but the first was second Avenue and Fourth . Postings on the Internet came 20 minutes after the attack from servers in this area . First attack was on impulse . Then he started hunting . Now he 's mad at himself . Back to impulse . [ Muffled music ] No ! Stop ! [ Indistinct chatter ] ♪ Coming through , coming through . If you 're gonna stare , at least get the hell out of my way , all right ? - Sorry . - All right , come on , come on . Fool , fool ! Step off ! [ Indistinct chatter ] ♪ I owe you money ? Excuse me ? You 're looking at me like I do . Hey , Brah . What are you doing checking out my girl ? Oh , hey , man . I didn 't know she was with someone . My bad . Good idea . Roll your ass out of here . - Come on , Brian . Let 's go . - Are you serious ? You can 't even get in my face . I 'm pretty confident I 'm staring right at where you do your thinking . Brah . [ Groaning ] We good ? Yeah , I think so . - Huh ? - Ow ! [ Groans ] [ Siren walls ] When you 're ready to trade up , let me know . 10-34 , possible weapon . [ Sirens wail ] [ Indistinct chatter ] All right , what do we got here ? Just a good , old-fashioned donnybrook . - Any weapons ? - She had her knuckles . Yeah , apparently she hits like Pacquiao . [ Woman screams ] No ! Move , move , move , move , move ! Get out of the way . Let 's go . Is he cut ? Out of the way ! [ Indistinct chatter ] Holly ! Bleeding . He 's going into shock . All right , Virgil , Teddy , split up . See which stores have videos . - Find out who wants to talk . - You got it . [ Coughs ] You , secure the scene . I want everybody out of here ! Block off the area ! He sliced a major artery . Put as much pressure on that as you can , or he 's gonna bleed out in a minute . Okay , hey , hey , buddy . Hey , hey . What 's your name , guy ? Steven . The ripper just posted a video 30 seconds ago . [ Screams ] Whoa . I just saw these two running from the crime scene right next to the victim . Go , go ! I 'm on it . Listen up , looking for a female blond , late teens , blue sweatpants , gray hoodie . Guy with her is in his 30s . Beard , dark hair , last seen going north on first . Steven . Steven , look at me . Look at me . We 're running out of time . You 're dying . Tell me what he looked like . [ Siren walls ] Help ... help me . The only thing I can do for you is get the guy who did this , but you gotta give me something ... height , hair color , anything . I got nothing . Come on , Steven . Steven ? Come on , man . Stay with me . Negative . [ Hip-hop music ] Any luck ? Am I smiling ? Only two people in New York who can identify the ripper blew right past me . I checked with the precinct . No one recognizes them . Canvassed the restaurants on the block , came up empty . They weren 't here to eat . Sweatpants , hoodie ... this was a quick trip to the corner . Two Korean markets and a juice bar . Security footage on all three didn 't show them . What is that right there ? What is that ? [ Clicking mouse ] It 's a bank card . He was going to the ATM . Six banks in a two-block radius . I 'll pull the footage . [ Sirens wail ] You still here ? I know you 've been through this before , boss . Just want to make sure you 're okay . Someone dying while I hold their hand ... day you 're okay with that , you should quit . Okay , listen up . 1PP 's up every precinct 's ass . All due respect to Freddy Krueger 's Facebook page here . We need this psycho in handcuffs posthaste . Yeah , he 's not our guy . Camera angle 's wrong , and I would 've seen blood all over him . And yet you look pleased . So what exactly am I missing here ? First three attacks were head-on . In each case , the femoral artery was slashed in a diagonal fashion . But vic number four was from behind . Task force has the ATM photo . They 're taking it around to martial arts studios and surgical supply stores . Maybe we should be looking for a butcher or a poissonnier . You know , he 's the chef that prepares the fish . He has to have extremely precise cutting skills . You know you said that out loud , right ? Precision . Why ? Well , hitting the femoral artery ... that 's one thing . But the brachial ? I mean , come on . Now he 's just showing off . - Turn around . - Why me ? Because you know what a poissonnier is . Come here . All right . Now this last attack on the victim from the ripper was from behind . And he should 've gone for the jugular . Sure , quickest way to kill someone . Unless it wasn 't the easiest way . Boom . All right , good . All victims are well over 6 feet . Our guy 's under . So he 's got a Napoleon complex ? David and Goliath quote ... we 're looking for a kid who was picked on . Who was Goliath but the original " knock the books out of your arms " guy , right ? Now victim number one . On his class ring , is " facta , non verba . " Deeds , not words . Davis prep , three blocks from the first attack . I mean , he must have just left there . Vic number two ... where was he hit ? 5 east 66th street . That 's right outside the lotos club . And number three was attacked on Fifth Avenue . Just made a purchase at Tiffany 's . Ripper 's taking his revenge on the one percenters . Yeah , but the fourth victim , he was up to his eyes in debt . He put himself through college on the G.I. bill . That 's the outlier . Ripper 's finally getting the attention that he was looking for . So desperate to keep that image and in a hurry , he looked for the first person he saw that looked like the other three , right ? This blade ... a blade that cuts like this is unique . And expensive . Hit the custom-made knife shops with our boy 's profile . Good . Sounds like progress . 'Cause bosses don 't like being called incompetent . Even if it 's true ? My mom always said I could pick a winner . [ Laughs ] Oh , you picked me ? - Mm . - That 's how it went ? Mm-hmm . - Okay . - [ Laughs ] No photos of family , hmm ? Not even a cat and dog . Just that football jersey . It 's Rod Gilbert . [ Laughter ] He played hockey . And the pictures are all upstairs . Oh . I get to go look ? - Maybe . - Mm . You show me yours first . Okay . My sister Grace . Please tell me that wasn 't last year . Oh , relax . I 'm 30 . - Okay , 28 . - Oh , God . We were at a Britney Spears concert . You know , Baby One More Time . - Toxic . - Mm . Oops ! ... I did it again . Okay , so I guess you 're more of a John Coltrane kind of guy . [ Sighs ] [ Cell phone vibrates ] Yeah . Hey . Did I wake you ? It 's 3 : 00 in the morning . What do you think ? Back in ' 03 , there was a missing persons . Little girl disappeared on her way to parochial school . You mean the one Pistol Pete made the bus driver for , - beat the crap out of him ? - Right , right , right . So blond hair , blue eyes . That photo that was all over the news ... she was wearing a T-shirt with that , uh ... that Mandy Moore on it . Except you got it wrong then , and you still haven 't figured it out . It 's Christina Aguilera . It 's two different people . Aguilera . Right , right . Okay . All right , thanks , Gary . Hey . What ? Don 't forget the J.D. in the toolbox in the garage . [ Cell phone clicks ] - Hey , Uncle Gary ... - Don 't " Uncle Gary " me . A fifth of bourbon and a joint ? I needed to kick back and roll a fatty . You know how it is . You 're 14 years old . You should be playing baseball . Or at least the Xbox version of it . Let 's go . Unreal . You know your mom 's been crying - for the last two hours ? - Sorry , dad . Hey . Take it down a notch . All right . All right . Let 's go , Ryan . See you , Uncle Gary . You sure that 's a good idea ? Now you 're gonna pretend your old man never hit you ? Christina Aguilera T-shirt but you couldn 't remember the little girl 's name ? Wasn 't my case . How 's a cop earn the nickname " Pistol Pete " anyway ? One of two ways . And I 'll give you a hint . It 's how he died . Officer-involved shooting ? Nope . Yuck . I gotta hand it to him . The pistol closed a lot of cases in his downtime . Yeah . What ? I think I found her . Let me see the age enhancement , full screen . Now put our girl up next to it . Mm-hmm . Huh . There 's a scar above her right eye . Matches in both photos . It 's her . - Nicole Kirby . - Good work . Now we just gotta figure out who our other murder witness is and where they 've been for the last ten years . Finest knives in the country . I started making them when I was in the army , . And then I apprenticed in Sakai , Japan . Oh , that 's the home of the samurai sword since the late 14th century , right ? Yeah . Looks like you learned the hard way , huh ? Occupational hazard . The doc gave me a choice , four operations or one . I made an exact copy of that one for that seal who killed that pirate in Somalia . [ Chuckles ] This one was for Wolf Gang Puck . Any idea who made this one ? Wow . Somebody who knows what they 're doing . Maybe a paramilitary freak . After the war in Iraq , black market 's been flooded with combat knives , every shape , color . I mean , collectors will pay thousands of dollars for one that 's actually been in battle . Hmm . This poor bastard didn 't stand a chance . The poor bastard had a name ... Steven Andrews . I 'm just like a bartender , guys . - I just serve the drinks . - Okay , bartender . What else can you tell us ? Well , um ... I 'd say that it 's a ceramic blade . Yeah , you can tell by the cut of the flesh . I mean , they 're almost as hard as diamonds , and they never need sharpening . All my best customers are demanding them these days . Any of these customers short , tough , big chip on their shoulder ? Um , me ? Could you be more specific ? Yeah , sure . I 'd like to see your client list . I 'd say if you came back with a warrant . - I need to protect myself , guys . - Yeah , I know . I can see how safety would be a real concern . It 's just kind of ironic that your fire exit 's blocked . Oh . Wow , that 's a $ 500 fine right there , huh ? Yeah , and on those vents ... Virgil , do you feel like that intake is up to code ? No , I don 't think so . Doesn 't feel like it . Uh-uh . Uh-oh . Food and drink . Gonna have to call the health department on you now . Ooh . Okay , okay . I get it . I might have a guy you should take a look at . - What , he 's that scary ? - Yeah . And he 's one of my best customers . Um ... [ typing ] there . Jim Cooke . Our M.I.A. witnesses ... New York bank , corner of St. Mark 's and Second . Chris Ellis withdrew $ 100 five minutes before the attack . I got his address from the bank . 225 east 19th . Two hours later , he made another withdrawal . The maximum allowed , 500 . He packed up and grabbed their bags . Something scared them . They did watch a serial killer at work . And they didn 't run to the cops . Chris and Nicole ? Good people . Lived here about a year or so ever since the mother died . You should see the way he takes care of that little girl . You know , he still walks her to school every morning and picks her up . It 's good to see , you know ? My kids fight like cats and dogs . Super . Police . The brother 's room . Yeah , living high he is not . Huh . I don 't get it . Most kidnappings , the kid 's the one who lives in squalor . Roller skates , Friday night family game time . Get the feeling he 'd have jammed a white picket fence in here , if he could have . He sacrifices to give Nicole a home . I don 't want to know what else that creep did to her in here . Wherever he 's running now , it 's toward completing this . Call it in . Captain , it 's Holly . We need an Amber alert . Suspect is believed to be in his 30s . Name is Chris Ellis . Yeah , we 're at his apartment right now . Send a couple of uniforms down . Jim Cooke ? NYPD detectives . Want to ask you a couple questions about some knives that you bought . Sure ! Whoa ! Hey ! Come on , ladies . Let 's dance ! Drop it , or we will shoot you . Yo , come on , come on ! Kill me ! Do it ! Kill me ! - Thought he was into knives . - I 'm not gonna shoot him . Well , I 'm not sure that technically a bicycle lock can be considered a deadly weapon . You ever been hit by one ? Hey , hey , hey , hey ! Hey , hey , hey ! Come here . Come here . Come on , come on . Hey , look , look . [ Groans ] That 's it . I can 't take it anymore . I want to confess . - Potter 's field . - Potter 's field what ? That 's where I buried him . - Who 's him ? - Little Ricky Gonzalez . Gonzo , they called him . Ugh ! Aah ! You killed Ricky Gonzalez ? [ Groans ] I did . They 've been looking for this guy for six months . - Yeah , Julie Simons too . - Huh ? You killed Julie Simons ? Yeah , I strangled her with my bare hands . She was shot six times . Yeah , that was afterwards . How ' bout this guy ? Did you kill him too ? I had to . Man , he wouldn 't stop talking . That guy made no sense , you know ? - Hello , Bellevue . - What ? No ! Ow ! No ! No ! No ! [ Muffled scream ] Nicole 's father died when she was five . That 's when she started running away , looking for him . Why ? Didn 't she believe her father was dead ? We didn 't have the best marriage . We said a lot of ugly things . Actually , the night before he died , I told him one day his drinking would kill him . But not in those exact words . Look , I regret a lot of things , but it was true . Nicole was ... you know , she was upset . She was looking for attention . Or maybe she was trying to tell you something . [ Sighs ] Sorry I 'm late . Was racing to get here , and believe it or not , some cop nailed my driver for speeding . Please , let me take care of that for you . Thanks . - I 'm Carter Watson . - I 'm Sergeant Ironside . You must be husband number two . - Excuse me ? - Rachael was just telling me the first marriage didn 't work out so well . Well , living with an alcoholic rarely does . So so how did Nicole feel about her new step-dad ? - I 'm not sure what ... - I was a father to that girl . Gave her everything she wanted . I 'm sorry , I didn 't mean to insult you . It can 't be easy . Cops showing up every couple of years , giving you false dreams . Please , you need to understand something . I have never given up hope that Nicole is still alive . I need you to take a look at something for me . Oh , my God . Are you okay , Mrs. Watson ? That 's her . That 's Nicole . And what about this man ? Do you recognize him ? Oh , my ... that 's ... I mean , even with the beard , that 's ... that 's Chris . That 's my brother . Do you think the ripper 's gonna hit again soon ? He was reckless , and he succeeded . It 's a turn-on for a guy like this . Task forces have zilch . Best shot of stopping another murder is your missing girl and her uncle . Got something here . At the time of Nicole 's disappearance , it had been years since Rachael and her brother talked . Detectives interviewed him . Nothing tripped anyone 's radar . Few weeks after Nicole goes missing , Chris moves to Winsted , Connecticut . Except now he 's Chris Ellis , and he 's got a sister , Nicole . Tthey lived there for the better part of a decade . Why they moved back to the city last year , - I have no idea . - He felt safe . Enough time had passed . You saw the apartment . Chris created the only family this girl knows anymore . Hey , the bank just sent over scans of his cashed checks . Regular deposits coming from legal aide on the east side . It 's not like Chris to miss work two days in a row . - He leave a message or email ? - No . You ever been to his apartment ? Many times . My daughter 's very close with Nicole . How was their relationship ? He 's her brother . I 'm just making sure . I 'm not sure what you 're asking . I 'm pretty sure I 'm asking what their relationship was like . I know cops don 't think much of legal aide , but 15 years working in this place , I 'm pretty sure I know what abuse looks like . If Chris had done something to her , I would have seen it . You spent a lot of time at his apartment ? Not the way you 're implying . But you would have . He 's a caring , sensitive man . We 're just trying to get a bead on who Chris is . I think I just told you . He have a second home , favorite place to vacation ? Second home ? He was a counselor with legal aide . I think he was hoping to one day put himself through law school at night . Do me a favor . Okay , when you see Saint Christopher , give this to him . I 'd appreciate it . You buy that crap ? When I was a rookie , there was this guy , " Crazy Eddie , " lived in apartment 4e on Broadway and 130th . Never left his place , thought there were aliens in his building . Whole block had a theory on him . Anytime a piece of gum went missing , it was crazy Eddie 's fault . - So one day I show up , right ? - Mm-hmm . And there 's smoke pouring out the building . Flames ... everybody in the building is outside , so I figure , here 's my chance to finally see Crazy Eddie in the flesh . They found him on the top floor , dead . He 'd been knocking on doors , making sure everybody else got out . Is that a " Chris is innocent " story or a " Chris is guilty " story ? 'Cause I could interpret it either way . Legal aide defended him for a reason . Might just be the right reason . Guy loves his job , protects the innocent . Hmm . Think I 'm wrong about one thing though . He 's not running to the white picket fence . He 's going to try and find it right here in the city . You said to call . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You did the right thing . Can I see ? [ Dramatic music ] ♪ Hey , Gary . What 's ... [ Both grunting ] Stop ! Gary . Okay , Gary ! Gary ! You touch that kid again , I 'll kill you ! Yo , G. Gary . You really think that 's going to make the kid 's situation any better ? What should I do , tell my sister to divorce the jerk ? I already did . Five times . Maybe I should call Child Services 'cause kids like him do real well in foster homes . Maybe you and me , we should file adoption papers . Hey , man . It 's your family . I 'm just ... I 'm ... Hey , man . I 'm just saying . Kidnaps his niece , then goes to work at legal aide ? Sounds like someone doing penance . When he turns himself in , I 'll ask him . That 's your plan ? Wait for a guy looking at two dimes in attica to surrender himself , I.D. A serial killer for you ? Pretty much , yeah . And my two superstar detectives . Took me two years to solve 12 homicides . Heard you guys did it in one arrest . Yeah , he was still confessing three hours after we got to Bellevue . Yeah , we would have been out of there sooner , but they wanted to keep Virgil for observation too . Okay , how about these other suspects ? Well , they all have solid alibis . Restaurant owner , chef , yachtsman . The ripper isn 't living in the present . In his mind , he 's still 15 years old . Maybe from a small town , sees rich kids come in for the summer in their nice cars , girls don 't talk to him again until after labor day . And how the hell do you know all that ? I don 't . But I do know what resentment feels like . [ Phone rings ] Well , if he 's stuck in that period of his life , maybe that 's his line of work . Gas station attendant , waiter . Yeah , hold on . [ Phone beeps ] Sarge , somebody 's waiting for you downstairs . Calls himself the " Patron Saint of Travelers " ? Patron what ? Right on time . [ Elevator bell dings ] Saint Christopher . If you 're looking for a fight , I ... won 't give you one . Where is she ? The same place she 's been for the last ten years . Safe . So why 'd you come ? [ Clears throat ] I got your note . _ _ _ _ How do you know ? You stopped making sense as a child molester . There was only one other story that fit , and we 'll deal with that . Right now , I got a killer on the loose . App the ripper . You got a look at him . No , I didn 't . Just the blood , yelling . But Nicole saw . Nicole 's father liked to drink . But who 's without sin , you know ? He loved her . After he died , when my sister married Carter , we stopped talking . Carter didn 't want Nicole hanging out with me . Took me a while to figure out why . When nice finally confided in me what that ... what that sick son of a bitch had done to her , I ... worst part was I wasn 't even surprised . [ Sighs ] I can 't let anything happen to that girl ever again . I promised her that much . And that 's why you 're here , right ? You know I won 't let anything happen to her either . I can 't turn her over until you lock up Carter . I need Nicole . You 've been around the law long enough to know that . I 've been around the law long enough to know what happens when you trust the police ! What are we doing here , Chris ? Thought you were gonna close him . Nah . You are . He wants to roll , but he needs to relate to a vulnerable female right now . It 's his comfort zone . What 's my way in ? If you 're who I think you are , you already know . [ Gasping ] Ryan . 456 east 17th street . I 'm an off-duty police officer . We got a man shot . Victim is conscious . We need an ambulance now . Hey , give me the gun . Ryan . He wouldn 't stop hitting me . [ Sobbing ] [ Gasping ] Where I come from , silence is considered a virtue . You know what " omerta " means ? From the Spanish hombredadi for manliness . All these manly men killing but never speaking a word about it . Just hiding behind their code . That code trickled to other things as well . Like when one of these manly men would beat the crap out of my Aunt Rita so badly , she couldn 't show her face for days . No one would say anything . Least of all , a ten-year-old girl who couldn 't understand why her favorite aunt missed her birthday party . I know you believe you 're doing what 's best . But that girl 's suffering . I don 't care how safe a place you think she 's in . Nicole 's depended on you for a decade . She still needs you . What do you guys want from me ? To give Nicole the same opportunity you had ten years ago . She 's 17 . It 's her turn to stand up for you . It 's complicated now . People could get hurt . You 're right . And we 're in a better position to prevent that from happening than you . Can I help you with something ? Hiding Nicole ? Obstruction of justice . There is a version where you don 't wind up going to jail . He did it for me . This is my fault . No , no , no . Nothing is your fault . Chris promised I would never have to tell anyone , testify in court . You think I 'm gonna make you testify ? No . No . I mean , that 's ... that 's gonna be on you . A man was murdered . I want justice for him . Sometimes , when ... when Carter would come for me , my mom would be home . She 'd go in her room , close the door , as if ... somehow that meant ... what he was doing wasn 't real . Chris got me away . I 'll help you if you let him go . Okay , Nicole . Honey , this last victim ... I held his hand as he died . Now I don 't know if he was on his way to church or the track , and I don 't care . But what I know is it could have been me . Or it could have been you or Chris . - That 's not an answer . - No , it 's not . I 've been thinking a lot lately about something that happened a while back . I 'll sometimes just sit back and count on others to do the right thing . And it never works , does it ? You sit back , and you wait . And suddenly you 're past where you can go back and fix it . It was ... horrible . There was just so much blood everywhere . Did you get a look at his face ? Not really . But his ... his hand . Um ... this part of his finger was missing . Well ... if it isn 't Rizzoli and Isles . Put your hands on the counter where I can see them . What , no joking today ? I don 't understand . I thought I helped you guys . I gave you names . Put your hands on the counter now . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Drop the knife , or I 'm gonna shoot ! See , my father was a driver . For 50 years , customers ... they 'd sit in the back of his town car , treating it like a garbage can . Go ahead . I took the last guy . We lived on the dollars they 'd flick across the front seat . They broke him . I know what you 're feeling . Yeah , I do . Northfield Prep , Springfield , Massachusetts , class of ' 95 . My freshman year , liver in my bed , toothbrush dipped in toilets . And those were the guys that liked me . Northfield Prep ? You 're one of them . Seriously , Teddy , this is what you 're gonna go with ? These elitist bastards ... they come here all the time asking for my help . But still , I 'm a whore to them . Every time they hand over their platinum cards , they give me that same look they gave my old man . You have no idea what it feels like . Those smug ... those smug , privileged looks . Well , they 're all scared now . You see , the ripper helped them understand , he showed them what fear feels like . Hey , Emerson . Hey . Terrifying people , making them feel scared ... that makes you what you hate . Come on , you 're better than that , huh ? You 're better than us . [ Groans ] Yep . This thing definitely isn 't working . What the hell ? We had an emotional connection going . Crap on your toothbrush , and your parents paid for that ? Yeah , it made me the man I am today . If that 's me , I 'm asking for my money back . It was a written test . You wouldn 't have gotten in to begin with . [ Grunts ] - Where 's Nicole ? - In another room . Is she all right ? She 's fine ... now . When do we get to see her ? Well , you don 't . I don 't understand . You find out two police officers want to talk to you about your stepdaughter who 's been missing for ten years , and what do you do ? You leave Manhattan , drive 30 miles to stop at your house first . Next time use a magnet . Works beer than a hammer . There 's enough kiddie porn on there to put you away for 20 years . Get him out of here . Call Barry on the East Hampton number . He 'll handle this . What are you doing ? You are a piece of work . Still protecting him instead of her ? I don 't ... I didn 't know . Sure , you did . She told me how you 'd close your door . Did that drown out the screaming ? I need to see my daughter . I want to talk to her . See your daughter ? The only reason you won 't be prosecuted is ' cause the statute of limitations on child endangerment has run out . - But the thing is , I couldn 't ... - Yes , you could ! You chose to do nothing ! I stood by and watched on the sidelines once too , and I still think about it , but this was your daughter . [ Sniffles ] You can 't arrest me . Oh , I can arrest you . By the time the D.A. voids my case , all those ladies you have lunch with , your friends on the board of the Central Park zoo ... they 'll know all about it . Ask Ruth Madoff how that 's working out for her . Not a chance in hell a judge is gonna let you have Nicole back . Come this way , please . This way . [ Door buzzes ] [ Sighs ] Up to me , you wouldn 't be standing here right now . But the minute you took that first trip to New Jersey with her , it became a federal case . And the FBI gets kind of bitchy about kidnapping . I guess sooner or later I knew I 'd be taking this ride . You did the right thing . All right . [ Clears throat ] All yours . Not like you guys to hand over a collar without some kicking and screaming . Just happy you have the handle . Yeah , why 's that ? Last guy I 'd want to be is the jerk prosecuting the hero . By the way , the New York Times already called . I gave them your mobile number . And if you think that was stupid , wait till you see the chain of evidence . I 'm pretty sure I forgot to read him his Miranda rights too , and the confession ... don 't even get me started on the confession . Bruises all up and down his body . I got pictures . And your Captain 's okay with all this . Go ask him . Only thing those two are gonna be asking anybody is where the front door is . [ Keys jingle ] There you go . Yo ... give me that bed bag . What happens to Nicole ? [ Handcuffs clink ] She finally gets what she deserves . Chris was the first one to pick up on it . He was 23 , wasn 't even a parent , but he did something about it . He was playing minor league baseball , and he gave that up to hide me . To protect me . It will get better . I promise . Nicole ! Thank you .

THIS IS WHAT YOU MU AIEVE NEXT . THESE CYLINDERS WERE DESIGNED BY THE INVADERS . THEY ARE BEACONS THAT ALLOW THEM TO LOCATE DIFFERENT POINTS IN SPACETIME . YOU WILL NEED TWO OF THEM . THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL FIND THEM . I KNOW THAT BUILDING . THAT WAS ONE OF OUR LABS AT KELVIN GENETICS . BELLY AND I DESIGNED IT . FROM THE EAST ENTRANCE , FOLLOW THE HALLWAY , TWO YELLOW DOORS . THEY LEAD TO A STAIRCASE . AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT STAIRCASE , YOU WILL FIND THE PRIVATE STAG OF WILLIAM BEL AT THE TIME OF RECORDING THIS , BELL WAS KEEPING TWO OBSERVER CYLINDERS IN THAT STORAGE FACILITY . YOU MUST RETRIEVE THEM . THE DOORS ARE MADE OF REINFORCED STEEL . THEY CAN BE UNLOCKED WITH BELL 'S HANDPRINT . ( Astrid ) WALTER , THAT 'S WHY YOU TOOK BELL 'S HAND WHEN WE WERE FREED FROM THE AMBER . YOU SAID THAT IT WAS FOR A STORAGE FACILITY . IT WAS FOR THIS . IF YOU CANNOT FIND BELL OR IF YOU LEARN THAT HE DD , YOU WILL HAVE TO UNLOCK THE STORAGE ... SO THAT 'S WHY HE WAS WITH US IN THE AMBER . I NEEDED HIM TO GET THE CYLINDERS . YOUR FREEDOM DEPENDS ON IT . WALTER , THAT 'S NOT THE ONLY REASON . HMM ? WELL , BEFORE THE INVASION , YOU HAD BEEN TALKING WITH BELL . HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO HELP YOU DEFEAT THE OBSERVERS , THAT HE REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT ISAS . AND THEN HE BETRAYED US TO GAIN FAVOR WITH THEM . I DO REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT THIS . HE CAME , AND I TRUSTED HIM . THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN . HE HAD AN ACCENT . I WAS BEING TORTURED . HE KEPT ASKING ME SOMETHING . HE KEPT ASKING ... " IS IT SAFE ? " THEN ISCAPED , AND BELL HELD ME . AND THEN HE DROVE ME RIGHT BACK WHERE I WAS BEING QUESTIONED . HE WORKED FOR THEM . HE WORKED FOR THEM ! WALTER , THAT 'S FROM THE MOVIEMARATHON MAN . ( Per ) HUH . YOU CALLED ME IN BOSTON . YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE READY TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN BUT THAT YOU NEEDED MY HELP TO DO SO . ( Olivia ) THEN YOU SENT ME TO GRAND CENTRAL STATION TO COLLECT THE THOUGHT UNIFIER . ( Peter ) AND BY THE TIME I GOT TO YOU AND ASTRID , YOU WERE WITH WILLIAM BELL , BUT THEN THE OBSERVERS FOUND US , AND WE REALIZED THAT THE ONLY WAY THEY COULD HAVE KNOWN WHERE WE WERE IS IF HE TOLD THEM . THAT 'S WHEN YOU AMBERED US . SO IF BELL LED THE OBSERVERS TO YOU , HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THE CYLINDERS WERE EVEN THERE TO BEGIN WITH ? ( Astrid ) OR IF HE EVEN HAD THEM ?

I WAS HOPING YOU WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD ... CHANGE THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE OF THE RUBBLE , AND HELP US CLEAR IT . THE OBSERVERS CREATED A DEVICE THAT DRAMATICALLY ALTERS ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE , SPEEDING UP MOLECULES IN ALL THE MATTER IN A CONTROLLED AREA . A PROCESS CALLED SUBLIMATION . YOU MEAN CONVERTING SOLID MATTER DIRECTLY INTO GAS ? SO ALL THE RUBBLE WOULD JUST EVAPORATE ? WELL , ESSENTIALLY , YES .

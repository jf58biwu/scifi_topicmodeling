 Chester 's Mill was like any other town . I love you , too , Rusty ! A typical place in every way . You off to the game today , Big Jim ? Until ... the unimaginable . What the hell happened here ? Hey , no . Don 't touch that ! I have just learned that the barrier around Chester 's Mill is being called a dome . No , no , no , stop ! We 're trapped . The dome kept everyone in . Why us ? Maybe we 're being punished . And threatened to let all their secrets out . What the hell do you want from me ? He 's lying to you ! But the dome had secrets of its own . We found this egg . What does " The pink stars are falling in lines "  mean ? And one thing was certain ... there was no escape . This dome can 't break us ! Look at what it 's doing ! We 're all gonna die in here . Tonight ... I really love the story 'cause it 's a survival story . - Step back . - ... the cast and producers go inside this incredible story . Well , in season one we had to establish the dome . We had to establish the chaos that it brought . And the horror without reveals the horror within . Shut up ! All you do is lie . And take an exclusive look ahead ... Second season is much more about the characters journeys and who they are . Someone has to make the hard choices ! - ... at the next chapter . - We start to explore what that dome is doing to the people . - Why did you leave me ? - With never-before-seen moments . This season will answer a lot of questions . And a warning . How do you explain all this ? You just have no idea what 's gonna happen . - No one ... - Oh , my God , my - mom 's in there ! - ... is safe . - Junior ! - Gear up , 'cause it 's about to get even crazier . You 're listening to WYBS , the Mill 's only 100 % independent home of rock . In a typical small town ... Sorry to bother you . Sam Verdreaux called . He wants us to know that he heard some kind of a bang . ... even the biggest problems can seem simple . You were right to get me , Linda . Never know with this damn place . Monday mornings have been brutal since they opened that Denny 's over in Westlake . I 'll take your French toast any day of the week , Rose . Big Jim Rennie was working on his next election . What is this ? That 's me buying your next vote . Says the guy who always runs unopposed . Big Jim is the main councilman left in the town . He 's also a used car salesman . So you know you can trust him . We 're all in this together . Julia Shumway searched for her next headline . So you 're the newspaper woman ? I 'm the new editor of The Independent . Yeah . Julia is a reporter who moves to Chester 's Mill with her husband , who 's a doctor . You see that truck ? That 's its fourth propane delivery this week . I called Sheriff Perkins three days ago . He sounded nervous . She wants to know the truth and she 's not gonna stop till she gets the truth . I 'll do some digging . God . You all right , there ? When we first meet Junior Rennie , he 's madly in love with Angie McAlister . I love you . It 's been a fun summer . And she has just told him good-bye . Ouch . Angie is not really looking for a serious relationship . She is really trying to get out of Chester 's Mill and make a better life for herself . You 're the only person in the whole world who knows the real me . And that 's why I can 't be with you . He has this kind of , like , hole in his heart after losing Angie . I 'm gonna be late for work . And he 's wanting to get back with her any way he can . It was a quiet place . But even Chester 's Mill had a dark side . When we first meet Barbie , he 's definitely in town under some suspicious circumstances . We 're not quite sure who he is , where he 's come from . We think he 's a bad guy . He 's got a big secret . A big secret ... So we got a problem here . ... and some really bad luck . _ Imagine if you 're in an ordinary American town . Suddenly you hear a rumbling and shaking . And the ground is moving under your feet . It 's like , everybody thinks there 's an earthquake . Just the feeling of the wind and the gust . All of a sudden ... boom , it hits . You really see the horror of it , you know , the ... our famous image from the first season is the cow being split in half . Aah ! Ugh . It really was a good symbol for sort of what happens . You know , the town gets severed . The dome comes down , people lose limbs , people get cut in half . The world sort of flips upside down . You have the unexplainable , the chaotic , the terrifying , all happening at once . You okay ? What the hell ? Right when the dome comes down , Joe is found , you know , on his farm . Joe McAlister is an everyday kid who 's 16 years old . Pretty good in science and math . Joe 's parents are trapped outside the dome . It 's some sort of invisible fence . Whatever it is , I 'd probably stop touching it . One of the things that was most terrifying about the premise is the idea that it 's invisible . You 'd be walking down the street or driving your car or your truck or your little plane , and you would hit this invisible barrier . Run ! What the hell is happening ? Am I doing something wrong ? Power 's out , Carolyn . Cashier said the pumps 'll be back on soon . " Chester 's Mill is known for its rich , fertile land and warm , inviting people . " Norrie is a L.A. kid who , uh , has a real attitude about anything that isn 't big-city hip . She has two mothers and they 're not happy with her behavior . - For the millionth time ... that was an accident . - That 's what you said when you knocked out that girl 's tooth . So they 're taking her to boot camp . And they are in the wrong place at the wrong time . Is everyone all right ? Nothing about this is all right . The barrier had a mysterious effect on Norrie . Norrie ! And then all of a sudden , she 's on the ground in the middle of the street having a seizure , mumbling ... The pink stars are falling . Sheriff Perkins , the plane smashed right into it . - Into what ? - Whatever it is , it cut off all our roads . Not just the roads ... the whole town . Suddenly , the peaceful town of Chester 's Mill would never be the same . In season two , we 're genuinely trapped . - Coming up ... - Get down ! ... an exclusive scene from season two of Under the Dome . In an instant , Chester 's Mill had been forever changed . - All right , everybody ... - And as authorities mobilized on the outside puts the dome over Chester 's Mill at roughly ... - Did he just call it a dome ? - Yeah . ... fear began to surface on the inside . What the hell is going on ? Isn 't it obvious ? We 're under attack . Nobody knows a damn thing , so there 's no point in spreading any rumors . There 's an initial panic of people not knowing what it is . Why is that dome here ? Is there a specific reason that this dome hit us ? No one was safe . And neither were their secrets . Any sign of your husband ? Not yet . Julia hadn 't seen her husband , Peter , since the dome appeared . She just assumes that he 's helping out in the chaos . He 's a doctor . - Is the doc with you ? - He 's not here ? Listen , your husband hasn 't worked Sundays in weeks . She thinks he must have been trapped outside the dome . And then , enter a tall , dark stranger . Who the hell are you ? Or blond . Barbie . Barbie ? - It 's a nickname . - I think Barbie , from the get-go , would love to have run back into the woods - and just hid out . - What about you ? - Where are you off to ? - Uh , the motels are all booked up , so I 'm just gonna rough it . Don 't be ridiculous . You can stay with Peter and me . - How do you guys have power ? - Backup generator . That 's Peter , behind you . To Barbie , Peter Shumway was a familiar face . Stephen King frequently writes about the ideal American town when it 's like the worm inside the apple . And what 's the worm gonna be inside of Chester 's Mill ? It 's like a ghost town in here . I should be able to hold down the fort . It 's easier to reach consensus when there 's only one voice to listen to , right ? Sheriff Duke Perkins was the town 's long-respected lawman . What are you gettin ' at , Jim ? No one knew about his corrupt dealings with Big Jim . What do we do when the people start asking about the propane ? Well , that has nothing to do with this . Oh . Big Jim has been storing up some propane for a-a certain amount of drug-making . There 's a lot I 've tried to protect you from . Like what ? But something within the dome triggered a reaction . My chest . Duke , is it your pacemaker ? - No , Duke ! - And Duke took their secrets to the grave . Holy hell . Big Jim wasted no time asserting himself , keeping his other business partner , Reverend Coggins , in line . You 're using our stuff ... you 're high as a kite . S ... so what ? It 's Judgment Day , Jim . And he never missed an opportunity ... - The flames are too high . - ... to take center stage in a crisis . You know , I always saw Big Jim as a guy who recited Winston Churchill speeches in the shower . And , uh , wished that he was in a time and place when he could 've been that guy . Thank you , everyone , for a job well done . Well , we couldn 't have done it without you , Big Jim . Oh ... Where were you yesterday , - Junior ? - Nowhere . Big Jim tightened his grip on the town and on his son . Junior is , uh , Big Jim 's only son , and on the one hand , Big Jim wants to help him , wants to keep him out of trouble . People are looking to me to lead . It reflects poorly when my son is AWOL . On the other hand , he kind of wears Big Jim 's patience , because he 's constantly having to deal with this kid who 's doing all these crazy things . Like when he puts his girlfriend in the fallout shelter . What the hell do you want from me ? Junior kidnaps Angie because he believes ... now that this dome has come down ... that there 's something wrong with her . I think it scrambled your brain . One of us has a scrambled brain , all right . You can 't see it , but I can . He truly believes the dome is infecting her mind , so he 's out to save her any way he can . I don 't believe we 've been , uh , formally introduced . I 'm , uh , Jim Rennie . People around here call me Big Jim . Barbie . Big Jim was now the law in town . Barbie . Well , that 's kind of a ... funny name for a fellow with your particular expertise . And he needed soldiers . What is your objective here , huh ? Is it to bring him in or we trying to take him out ? I don 't see it makes a difference to a guy like you , does it ? Barbie intuitively goes , " That 's a guy I 've got to watch out for . " I told you , we 're finishing this . Why is that ? So you can show the town what a big man Big Jim is ? Barbie notices along the way that this guy is just power-hungry and up to no good . Sometimes an example needs to be made , you know ? Command respect . God , I swear , you ask more questions than anybody I 've ever met . Well , you know you 're pretty good at evading them . Barbie couldn 't escape Chester 's Mill , or the wife of the man he 'd killed . You all right ? You were , uh , talking in your sleep . Yelling , actually . He 's obviously very handsome , and , so , you know , there 's an attraction , there 's chemistry . Thanks again for letting me crash here . With my husband missing and everything that happened today , it was nice to have the company . They get really close , and they form this fast friendship , this bond . Julia continued to ask questions . And you really were just passing through Chester 's Mill ? No connection to anyone here in town ? No . So , we start this chess game between the two of them . Being a reporter , she knows the questions to ask . - So , you went through my stuff ? - You lied to me . When Julia suddenly fell ill , Barbie decided to reveal her husband 's secrets . I 've got the cash , but my wife 's home . Meet me at the other spot . Julia learns that her husband Peter had a gambling problem that he was concealing . And Barbie was coming to collect those debts . - I don 't have it ! - Yeah ? My boss is not gonna like that . So , where is he now ? He doesn 't come completely clean . He must have taken off . And then , eventually , finds himself against the ropes with no way out . I found this life insurance policy today . Julia soon discovered the truth behind her husband 's death . He needed you to kill him . She processes everything that happened , and she realizes , well , Peter had put Barbie in a situation where he really had no choice . It was shoot or be shot . You know , in some weird way , I think he did all this to try to protect me . 'Cause this would be void if he committed suicide . Barbie 's done enough heroics in Chester 's Mill already to prove that he 's sort of more the hero than the villain . But in the future , there can be no more lies . With secrets no longer between them ... We 're gonna be okay . ... Julia and Barbie 's relationship quickly deepened . Well , your son takes after you , too . He stopped what could have been a full-blown riot . Big Jim 's relationship with his son had also evolved . You ever consider a career in law enforcement ? When Junior was made a deputy , he earned Big Jim 's respect . A chip off the old block . But that respect would be short-lived . There is a pipe that bursts in the fallout shelter , and Big Jim hears it . He goes to look , and finds Angie . You 're gonna get me out of here , right ? He does something really interesting . He doesn 't pick her up and drag her out of there and get her help . I just , uh , I just need to think on this a little bit . No , no , no , you can 't leave me down here ! You can 't ! You ... No . No ! Wait ! Wait ! Help ! Help ! You think the dome is gonna be here forever ? Coming up ... This is the real discovery . There 's something else at work here . What does it mean ? Excuse me . Where can a girl charge up in this town ? Everyone was adjusting to life under the dome . I have a generator . Norrie goes to this kind of teenage bonfire where they 're all mourning the loss of their electronics . Without my music , I can get a little , you know , super bitchy . Well , there 's definitely an immediate attraction to Norrie from Joe . He sees this new girl . She 's dressed differently , she talks differently . - What are you doing ? - I don 't know . Uh , maybe I can fix it . Really ? That thing blew up like the Death Star . Yeah , but the Empire rebuilt the Death Star in The Return of the Jedi . I like nerds . Norrie ? - Oh , God . - Norrie , are you here ... ? And her mom finds her . Let 's go . And the second she grabs Joe 's hand ... - Oh , my God . Norrie ? - What happened ? Pink stars are falling in lines . - Norrie ? ! - The pink stars are falling - in lines . - Norrie . And that 's the first time you see them seizing together . Well , they 're obviously meant to be in some way . - You ready ? - Let 's do it . Of all the things to do after you 've had a double seizure . Let 's try it again . And we record ourselves doing that to see what happens . The pink stars are falling ... That 's the first step to them figuring things out . What does this mean ? Maybe we 're not supposed to tell anyone . Why not ? 'Cause the dome doesn 't want us to . The dome continued to reveal itself to those inside ... What is this ? ... while forces outside had other intentions . Look . They 're bussing in more soldiers ? No . Civilians . It 's been nearly a week since this thing came down . Why bus the families in now ? Haven 't you ever been to camp ? They 're finally giving us our own visitors day . Yeah , visitor day was interesting , because it , uh ... at first , it 's set up as if it 's a nice thing . It 's a lovely day in which we all get to see our relatives . Sinners ! The happy day wouldn 't last long . Over and over , the Lord has spoken one word in my ear . MOAB . - MOAB ! - Thank you , Reverend . Thank you for those inspiring words . Visitor day is set up as a sort of family reunion . " What 's ... happening ... out there ? " Barbie comes to find out that 's not the intent at all . They 're not about to let this thing mess with the outside world . It 's the episode that starts out with the best-case scenario and ends with the worst-case scenario . MOAB . Come again ? What your reverend was ranting about . MOAB is not a city . It 's an acronym ... For " the mother of all bombs . " The army is gonna blow up the dome , even if that means blowing us up with it . Good Lord . - We 're all just gonna die . - No . No . We get everybody to a shelter . Where ? The old cement factory . Some of those tunnels run pretty deep . Faced with their final moments , Chester 's Millers each made their peace ... Last call . ... including Big Jim . Why are you doing this ? Well , if we 're all gonna die today , you might as well die a free woman . Norrie and Joe are going on kind of their first little adventure together , and there 's a huge missile coming straight for us . And , of course what else do you do when the world 's ending ? It 's just this special , fiery moment between both of them . When we touched , we didn 't have the seizures . More importantly , we didn 't die . The fact that we can 't blow up that dome kind of sets everybody to thinking that this dome thing is bigger and stronger and more important than any of us can ever really think about . They 're now really cut off from the outside world because everything outside the dome is now a wasteland . And they 're stuck because if a bomb can 't touch the dome , what can ? It kind of reinforces the idea that we 're gonna be here for a while and that he needs to step it up and be the leader . God told me to come out here . What the hell you doing here ? Jim , I know you think this town belongs to you , and maybe ... maybe it used to , but today ... Today 's a new day . You know , you 're right , Reverend . Big Jim felt that Reverend Coggins was getting crazy , was gonna lead to problems . You don 't want to make an enemy of Big Jim under the dome . And that 's when Big Jim starts to realize , " Wow , I could be king . " He 's on a mission to control his enemies and to put himself in charge . With no end in sight to their ordeal ... Damn it . - Now what ? - I lost the signal . ... Julia worked to uncover the mysteries of the dome . Julia ends up running around with Dodee ... - We 're close . - All right . ... trying to get a signal , which they think is going to be the source of the dome . I think it 's coming from them . I know it doesn 't make any sense . It sort of does . It was time to share their secret . The pink stars are falling in lines . Okay , I 'm officially freaked out . Norrie and Joe continue to test their connection to the dome . Anything ? Yeah . You 're really good at that . From the dome , Joe . I didn 't feel anything , like a seizure . Me neither , unfortunately . Maybe we 're going about it all wrong . Joe , being smart , figures out that there may be something at the center of the dome that powers the dome . It shouldn 't be too far now . Norrie and Joe go off on a search . The hair 's standing up on my arms . There it is . They start uncovering this mound in the ground , and there 's another dome . And as they uncover the dirt and leaves , they see a small egg . So , what was weird has gotten even weirder . Maybe it 's the generator that created the whole dome . The discovery of the mini-dome and the discovery of the egg ... - Okay . - ... It 's really sort of our portal into the next phase of the dome . Norrie ? Joe and Norrie discover the dome had ways to communicate with them . Mom ? I need to find my mom . Because something horrible is about to happen . Mom , you 're not going anywhere . Norrie 's mother was diabetic . You have to be brave . The dome 's arrival had caused dangerously limited resources ... I will , I promise . ... and cut off her access to life-saving insulin . Bring her back . I 'll do anything you want . Just tell me what you want ! I 've never met anyone like her before . It 's kind of amazing to feel that connected . It 's even more intense at the egg . The egg ? What egg ? For Julia , that egg is confirmation that there are other forces at work here . It 's pink . It was black before . She 's kind of mesmerized by the egg and the mini-dome and trying to figure out what 's going on . And all of a sudden ... The monarch will be crowned . What did you just say ? Who are you talking to ? Julia realizes that she 's chosen in some way to be connected to it . The monarch will be crowned . What the hell you doing here ? Junior was angry that his father had released Angie from the fallout shelter . I just want to make sure she 's safe . You 're not in your right mind , Junior . You sound just like your mother did at the end . The rejection pushed Junior toward Big Jim 's lifelong enemy ... My dad kicked me out . ... where he learned a family secret . I can 't imagine your dad 's an easy man to live with , especially after your mother dying . It was , um ... a tragic accident . Is that what he told you ? You told me she died in a car crash . The ultimate drama is going to be about family , and that family has its tragedy that gets very messy . Wasn 't an accident , was it ? No . Junior wants his dad to , like , tell the truth for once . Your mother had been ... unsteady for a while . He explains that she committed suicide . He 's been protecting Junior from the truth of the situation . Why ... did you lie to me ? 'Cause I didn 't want you to know that she chose to leave you . I 'm so sorry . Just to hear it from Big Jim 's mouth is what he kind of needed in order to rebuild their relationship . You got a problem with this ? Allow me . I believe you . Angie . Hey . I just had a seizure at the diner . What do you mean , you had a seizure ? I was just standing there , and then I ... I went blank and collapsed . Angie ! The pink stars are falling in lines . Did you say , " The pink stars are falling "  ? How did you know that ? And , obviously , those words are a connection somehow , but they 're not sure exactly why . It 's what you found in the woods , isn 't it ? And you 're not freaking out about it ? I can 't deny that I 'm a part of this now . Me , Angie and Norrie all place our hands on the mini-dome . It 's almost like ... these are locks and our hands are the keys . We notice that there 's a fourth handprint that appears that there isn 't a person for . I think we need a fourth hand . I knew you 'd come find me . Why have you always said that the dome is making me sick ? Because it 's true . But there 's more , isn 't there ? Yeah . Junior is seeing all the pieces come together , and so he 's finally feeling like he can show Angie his mom 's art studio . A couple months before she died , she had this dream about me . And she just started painting this as fast as she could . Pink stars . When he reveals this different side of him and his mother , she starts to question , maybe I was sick . Maybe he knows more than I do . Maybe , way back then , she knew the dome was coming . And I must be part of it , because I 'm in this painting . And now , obviously , you 're part of it , too . She doesn 't trust him still , but they 're just connected in this way . The four hands are the four people who can unlock the mystery of the dome . And the phrase that no one has known what it 's meant ... " The pink stars are falling "  ... the pink stars fall . Then the dome lights up . Oh , my God . It 's the pink stars . And it projects all these beautiful constellations ... the dipper , Castor and Pollux and all that stuff . It 's kind of a star map . It 's a piece of what the dome means , but it doesn 't outright give answers . Beautiful ! But ... what does it mean ? Big Jim was constantly on high alert ... You got one second to tell me why I shouldn 't blow your damn head off . ... but he never expected to see his old friend Maxine Seagrave . Because you don 't want to ruin this beautiful face ? Maxine 's another one of his business associates in the illegal drug trade . This is , uh , Dale Barbara . He ... We find out that Barbie and Jim are connected through Maxine . In terms of Big Jim , she was partners with him . In terms of Barbie , she was sleeping with him , and Barbie works for her as a collector . We make a damn good team . And as long as this dome is around , I can see us making this town our playground . What are you doing ? We 're finished , Max . Maxine , ultimately , sort of draws the conclusion that Julia is why I won 't join sides with her . First , she turns up out of nowhere and turns out to be the woman who was sleeping with Barbie , who 's now sort of my boyfriend . Can I help you ? Right now you can 't even help yourself . And the first time I get to meet her face-to-face , she puts a bullet in me . It 's so cold-hearted , um , that it 's kind of great . You hungry ? After unlocking the star map , Junior and Angie were left to wonder what it all meant . Can you believe it , Angie ? The way our lives are braided together , and they will be forever . What ? Are you insane ? It is not about you and me . It will never be about you ... - I don 't believe you . - Well , believe it . We will never be together ! Then I 'm out . I 'm done with you , with this , the mini-dome , all of it . I 've never met someone so selfish ! Junior 's departure had consequences , as the dome unleashed its wrath . Julia ? ! Julia , hey , hey , hey , hey , stay with me . Hey , you got to hurry , Joe . She 's crashing . And a mysterious storm descended . It 's not just weather . It 's the dome . I think it 's angry at us . Junior ! Look at what it 's doing ! It 's sending a message ! You have to come back to the group . It takes all of us , or we 're nothing . Barbie worked frantically to save Julia . Come on ! Come on . We got to go ! Angie ! And after Junior 's change of heart , the storm receded . I was right . Storm 's breaking up . Julia survived the attack , but Maxine would have to answer for it . You know it 's Max who shot her , right ? And I also know that it 's time to stop her . Big Jim hates Maxine because she has the goods on him , and she threatens to tell the town . Should take both of us to do it . Well , we 're gonna do this by my rules , Jim . We 're taking Max alive . Barbie now becomes the ... the one really fighting for order in this town . Big Jim evolves into a man who 's seeking to capitalize on the chaos of this town . You 're not saving Chester 's Mill . You 're eating this town alive . Big Jim is a smart guy . He 's a practical guy , and he sees Barbie as ... at the beginning , at least ... as someone who could be useful to him , and , throughout the course of the season , Big Jim realizes that maybe Barbie 's not really the guy to be on his team . I 'm gonna go get our car . We 'll take them down to the station . So Big Jim realized that he could kill several birds with one stone . He 'd kill Maxine and her bodyguard . And then he could get rid of Barbie by putting the blame on him . Barbie , put that weapon down ! Put it down now ! Linda , thank God ! - He 's gone nuts ! - He 's lying to you ! He killed ' em . I was next . Linda , I 'm telling you ... Shoot that son of a bitch ! This has been a very dark day in Chester 's Mill . Maxine Seagrave and her business associate were murdered . An attempt was made on the life of Julia Shumway . One person is responsible for all this : Dale " Barbie "  Barbara . Big Jim uses his powers of persuasion and he is able to convince the town that he is the leader , that Barbie committed these murders . The people ... will seek the death penalty . The four hands knew that the dome was communicating with them . But to what end ? What do we do now ? If these stars are really us , then we have to go to the same spot on the big dome . Joe figures out that they 're being called to go to the big dome . They all go to the dome , put their hands on it , they see this kind of ghostly image of Big Jim coming forward . Dad ? And he starts bleeding and he gets these knife wounds . Junior 's freaking out , and all four of us look down and we have these knives . Junior ? No ! What the hell was that ? I ... I thought we were coming here for answers . I think that was it . Big Jim has to die . And I think we 're supposed to do it . Season two , we explore - the mythology of the dome . - Coming up ... What 's happening ? ... an exclusive scene from season two of Under the Dome . What 's it doing ? I think it 's mad we didn 't kill Big Jim . - Angie , we can 't do that . - Joe , Norrie and Angie grappled with what to do next . It wants him dead . - Why ? - I don 't know . Maybe so that he doesn 't kill your monarch ? And they found a mysterious cocoon inside the mini-dome . When the butterfly hatches , the monarch will be crowned . Dodee 's continued suspicions led her to a discovery . And transmissions from the outside helped her understand the importance of the egg . Any idea where the hell that egg thing is , soldier ? There is evidence that the outside world knows what 's going on . The military 's looking for an egg ? Yeah . And I 've seen it . It was at Joe McAlister 's barn . When Big Jim learns about the egg , he thinks that that 's the key to the dome . Maybe if you get this thing , you could bring down the dome . He doesn 't want the dome to come down yet . He hasn 't yet exercised all his power or his ambition . He wants to have control of that egg . Linda ? The radio station 's on fire . Could it be arson ? No idea . It 's Barbie . We 've been broadcasting info about him night and day . I 'd be careful , Linda . If you find Barbie , you call me . The entire town was looking for Barbie . And he needed help to save Julia from Big Jim . Julia 's still at the clinic . Now , if she wakes up , he 's gonna kill her . Wh ... why ? Because if she tells people that it wasn 't actually me that shot her , his whole story falls apart . So help me save Julia . With Angie 's help , Barbie took Julia to safety . I love you . Drive fast ! Put your hands on your head ! With Barbie in custody , Big Jim went looking for the egg . What the hell ? But Joe and Norrie were one step ahead . Where is it ? We have no idea what you 're talking about . They had moved the egg . And now found the butterfly was ready to hatch . It 's really happening . When , uh , the monarch hatched , - they didn 't know how to get it out . - What the hell ? Every time its wings touched the invisible dome , It would cause a black color to appear . Is it just me or is it getting crazy dark outside ? The black spots began to also cover the big dome outside until Chester 's Mill was in total darkness . So , now what ? Junior soon found them . And was forced to make a decision . Things are happening , Junior ! Do you want your dad to lock that thing away before it can give us any answers ? Let 's go . When Julia woke up , there was no time to waste . Where 's Barbie ? I guess everyone 's out dealing with the blackout . And with everybody distracted , Julia and Angie freed Barbie . Angie ? Angie McAlister ? We 're on the move with the mini-dome . Joe ! Thank God ! - Don 't take another step . - Junior , stop ! No ! This guy 's a psychopath ! Hey , is that supposed to do that ? The four hands don 't know why they were chosen . And they were desperate to figure out a way to release this monarch . And maybe make the dome go away . It opens the mini-dome , now we have the egg , and the butterfly is up floating around . Okay . Another piece to the puzzle . You 're the monarch . What do we do ? We have to take that egg to the real authorities . Like Big Jim ? No , we are not taking anything to that monster . I 'm done listening to you all run down my dad . He 's the only thing keeping this town together . Hand it over , Julia . Run ! Once again , Barbie sacrificed himself to protect his friends . Barbie ! Go ! Get up ! You 're done ! As the authorities searched for the egg , What the hell does " The pink stars are falling in lines "  mean ? Big Jim learned of his late wife 's mysterious connection It 's like she knew all this was gonna happen . How is that possible ? I don 't know . If your wife saw the dome coming , that means your family 's important . That means you 're important .

 This is what Destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system . We are going to survive , we are going to make it home . I 'm telling you , the ship came here for a reason ! Destiny is powered by the stars themselves . He and Young are bumping heads , yes . Not sure which camp is the better choice . We just pretend nothing happened . We need to be ready for the next encounter ... For the sake of the crew . For the sake of the crew . You dreamt you were the spy who leaked everything about Icarus to the Lucian alliance . No , no , it wasn 't me . I was Colonel Telford . We know that the Goa 'uld had brainwashing technology . It is possible that the alliance now has that capability . Once you are on Earth , you are on your own . Whoever you are , you must be using the ancient communication stones . I don 't know what you 're talking about . Colonel Telford would never make such a mistake . We know that you are a traitor and a murderer . Now we know you 're a coward too . You 've found another Icarus planet . We 're all very excited to have Dr. Rush 's full cooperation . Kill me and you kill Rush ! Begin venting the atmosphere in Colonel Telford 's quarters now . You ! Open this damn door ! We both know you 're not going to kill me . Mr. Brody , this is Wray . You need to restore the atmosphere ... This is Young . Please disregard that request . By letting this happen , you are participating in not only the murder of Colonel Telford , but Dr. Rush as well . Okay . Sir , you 've made your point . I 'm not trying to make a point . Come on ! Open the door , sir , please ... I know what I 'm doing . What you 're doing is killing him ! I know that , Lieutenant . Brody ! What should we do ? The Colonel 's bluffing . He 's not going to kill him . What 's happening to him ? All right ... no . Sir , I cannot ... You 've killed him . Brody . Come on , David . David , come on . You 're all in danger . What ? They 're coming . Who 's coming ? The Lucian alliance . They 're coming to take Destiny . Stargate Universe : " Incursion Pt 1 " Season 1 Episode 19 We 've been informed that this ship faces an incursion by armed forces of the Lucian alliance . The group responsible for the attack on Icarus base . All military personnel onboard have been placed on high alert . If the enemy has acquired the means to dial Destiny , their point of ingress will be the stargate . Brody , we 're clear . So the gateroom is off-limits . All surrounding corridors have been placed in lockdown . No one may enter without proper authorization . I 've provided Homeworld Security with intel on the planet from which the Lucian alliance intends to launch their assault . They 're dispatching forces as I speak . The best-case scenario , Earth forces take the launch point intact and we gain a supply line from home . The worst-case scenario is that our forces don 't make it before the attack is launched , in which case we 'll have to deal with them on our end . In that event , all non-military personnel will be ordered back to your quarters , where you will remain until the situation has been resolved . Make no mistake ... This will be dealt with swiftly and decisively . Thank you . That is all . Colonel . Only a couple of hours ago , Colonel Telford admitted to being a mole for the Lucian alliance . And now , suddenly , he 's on our side ? Yeah . You trust him ? I didn 't say that . What in the hell was that ? " What in the hell was that , sir ? " All you had to do was tell me . I was keeping you out of it . You didn 't have to . If I 'd known killing him and bringing him back was the only way to beat that brainwashing technology , I 'd have been behind you 100 % . So you 'll follow orders as long as I explain everything beforehand ? No , sir , that is not what I meant ... That 's great , because if it was , we 'd have a problem , Lieutenant . Do we have a problem ? No , sir ... Good , because now is not the time for that . No headaches or blurred vision ? No . I told you , I 'm fine . Well , Rush is fine . I 'll find out about me when I switch back . Look , I really need to go , and ... T.J. Can you give us a minute ? Yes , sir . Thanks . How are you feeling , David ? Confused . I bet . You went the whole nine yards . To the brink and back . I had to . You know , in my defense , it wasn 't the first thing I tried . Yeah . Thanks for that . At least the brainwashing explains why you 've been such an ass . I 've read the SG mission reports of that method being done in the past . I just never ... You have no idea what it 's like to remember things that you 've done that ... Terrible things . You weren 't yourself , David . You 've got to send me back . Not yet . I 've done all that I can on this end ... I 've already killed you once ... I 'm more useful to you in my own body back there with them . You know that . How else will you get Rush back ? - Listen ... - Get him out of there . David , you 've just come back from the dead . I want you to get your strength back first . Excuse us . T.J. Listen , when they come , I want you here , safe . Safe ? If they break containment , there could be wounded . We 're going to need you . What we 'll need is a real doctor . You 're up for this . Not even close . What are you planning to do ? Evacuate the atmosphere in the gateroom the minute they step through . Kill them all , you mean . You think I have a choice ? If you 're asking for forgiveness , I can 't help you there either . T.J ... I 'll do my best . You 're back . That was me . I had to see whether you were faking . Well , I wasn 't . I apologize . Back to work . I know . Running planetary scans . Sir , it looks like the intel is good . The planet 's laced with naquadria deposits . We 're also reading a huge energy signature emanating from what looks like a pyramid . Pyramid ? That takes me back . Unfortunately , the complex inside is shielded against beaming technology . So Rush can 't be beamed out . No , sir , we 'll have to go in with ground forces from the outside . All right , Colonel . You have a go . What was that ? We 're under attack . Can we dial the ninth chevron ? Not without blowing everything up . Dial it . Get ready ! We 're going now ! The Lucian alliance is an organization of humans from a number of sovereign planets who have taken control of the resources and technology ... Alliance is made up of power-hungry ... Violence as a means of enforcing their dominion . Leadership ... The air force video ? Yeah . I 'm just seeing if there 's anything in here that might help . Control a sizable army and numerous Ha 'tak vessels , or former Goa 'uld motherships ... What 's he going to do ? The Colonel ? They 're sending an army . What do you think he 's going to do ? This is it . It 's happening now ? Yeah . Go ! Radio back when you reach the other side . And take him with you . Colonel Young . I see them , Eli . All personnel , report to your designated areas . This is not a drill . Defense teams stand by . Copy that . Go , go ! Which button ? This one . How long will it take till we reach vacuum ? A minute or so ? That 's about right . Colonel . Defense teams stand by to secure prisoners on my order . Copy that . Monitor from here , stay on the radio . Got it . What happened ? Colonel ? No , no , it 's me . Rush ? Yeah . The ship ... The Lucian alliance ... Yeah , no , we know everything . Telford told us . So what are we doing about it , then ? Let 's just say it 'll all be over in a few minutes . Get to your quarters . Come on . Colonel , I 'm reading a huge energy spike . At this rate , they 've got less than a minute before their core goes up . Get our people out of the shielded areas and beam them back to the ship , now ! The core is going to go critical . I can 't stop it . Still no signal from the other side ? Get as many of our people through as you can . Colonel , we still have two 302s on their way back from the planet . We can 't wait . Get us out of here . Aren 't we supposed to go to our quarters ? These are my quarters . And I 'm not going anywhere . Colonel ? They brought Rush along with them . We 're going to have to do this the hard way . What did you do to the gate ? It wasn 't me . You killed over a hundred of my men ! It was Rush ! Massin . Massin , your father 's name . It was my password . Gate travel must have severed the link . It 's me . Telford ? Lucian alliance forces , you are surrounded and sealed in . You will also find the intel provided by Colonel Telford is now useless . Lay down your weapons in front of the doors and step back into the center of the room with your hands on your heads , or we will vent the entire compartment to space . Can they do it ? Yes . Then they should have . Colonel , they 're up to something . Talk to me . They 've got something to open the doors ! Vent the atmosphere in the gateroom , Brody . Do it now . Too late . Take cover ! Get back ! Go ! Fall back ! Rush , you should stay here . No , no . The ship 's under attack ! Rush ! Rush ! Okay , Eli , it 's time to go . No , just wait . No , Eli , let 's go . Now ! Yeah . Yeah . There 's an elevator this way . Oh , God ! Go ! Rush ! Wait ! You 're welcome . Want to get the hell out of there now ? Chloe , you 've been shot . Sorry , sorry . See , it 's okay . You 'll be ... You 'll be okay . Eli ... Uh ... Okay . Hey , you 'll be fine . You 'll be fine , all right ? Chloe ... Oh , my God ... I 'll be right back . Okay ? Go through this way . Let 's go ! Over here . Colonel Young ? Who is this ? Commander Kiva of the Lucian alliance forces . We will not be complying with your request to surrender . We barely made hyperspace . This time it was even closer . What about casualties ? Two of my 302s couldn 't make it back , and if Rush was still on the planet ... I 'm sorry , Sam . Yes , sir . Did any of them make it to Destiny ? I haven 't heard . Hands behind your back . Do it ! Okay ! So much for that . Why didn 't you evacuate the compartment to space ? That was the plan . He didn 't do it to save you . Not me . The connection was severed the minute I stepped through the gate . Give me the lay of the land . This is the gateroom . They 've also occupied the surrounding corridors . They had advanced further , but they pulled back . Just took what they could hold with limited manpower . That 's smart . Once they retreated , I locked down the area behind them . Given the technology at their disposal , it won 't stop them , but it should give us some breathing room . The prisoners are being held here . Between them and us , 30 feet of corridor either way . Well , the second we hit the outside sections , those hostages are as good as dead . Colonel . Yeah ? I 've done a head count . We have 12 missing and presumed captured , including Riley , T.J. , Eli , and Chloe . Come on ! Eli ? Hey . Hey . What happened ? You were shot . I stopped the bleeding . No , you 're fine . Look up here . Hey , look at me . Look at me . Where are we ? I don 't know . I 've never been to this part of the ship before . I don 't think anyone has . I just pressed some random buttons . We can 't get back . I 'm guessing someone locked out elevator access . Us or them ? Yeah ... That 's the problem . I just need to get to a window , get an idea of where we are , and ... And then we can walk back . Oh ... Oh , no , no , no ! I 've got you . Come on . Come here . Ready ? Here we go . One , two , three . Okay ... Okay . Lean on me . Okay . I 've got you . Ready ? Yeah . Here you go . Colonel Young . Go ahead . Here 's how I see the situation ... We have the gateroom and some of your people , you hold the control interface room which , I 'm told , is the ship 's nerve center . What do you want ? We came here for the same reasons you did . We don 't want to hurt anyone . You 're welcome to stay aboard Destiny and help us realize the potential of her discovery . Lay down your weapons and join us or , if you prefer , we can drop you off at the next inhabitable world of your choosing . Or I vent the atmosphere in the sections you 're occupying and keep the ship . If you had that in you , Colonel , you would have done it already . The point is , I have the ability to end this conversation right now . Sergeant ? She wanted to see you , sir . Wouldn 't shut up , in fact . As you were , Sergeant . We are way past the point of fighting our way out of this situation . We need to negotiate with these people . And I think I should be the one to ... Yeah , yeah . No , I think you 're right . Him . Him . And her . That 's a mistake . It 's a demonstration . All it will do is force their hand . Do you want control of the ship or not ? They have some of our people . But we have some of theirs . So the first thing we need to do is suggest an exchange . Do you think they 'll do it ? No . But I think it 's worth a shot . This is the control interface room . This is the gateroom . If we cut our way through the wall here , we can flank them . I can lead a team ... That will reduce our numbers here . We take the control interface room , we won 't need them here . The ship will be ours . These sections are in red . That section of the corridor is exposed to space . The ship 's shield will hold long enough for us to pass . We will slowly vent atmosphere to space , yes , but we could seal the corridor again after we 've taken the ship . Take six men . I 'll need twice that ... Six . And if anything goes wrong ... These three die . Not her . She 's a medic . We can use her in the event ... Commander Kiva . Who is this ? My name is Camile Wray . I am the civilian authority aboard this ship . I 'd like to act as an intermediary to resolve this issue without further bloodshed . Colonel Young will not transfer control of this ship to you . And you will ? No . But I will expedite a prisoner exchange ... Your people for ours . If I release my prisoners , Colonel Young will not hesitate to vent this compartment . You have 12 of our people . We have only four of yours . I propose an even trade , four for four . This way , you maintain your advantage and gain some much-needed manpower . Colonel Young agrees with this ? In our society , the military takes orders from civilian leadership . I 'll consider it . Nice job . That should buy us some time . Look , you 're trying to save lives here . Obviously that 's a good thing . But even if she agrees to the four , which is doubtful , she won 't go any farther than that . Once the equation tips to the point of acceptable losses ... Be no acceptable losses ... Colonel Young has already determined what that number is . He knows the chances of us winning without loss of life are practically nil . So limit our losses , yes , all that we can , but eventually , you 'll have to do something ... You don 't know what you 're talking about . I 've recently been one of your acceptable losses ... You knew what you were getting into ... You should have disconnected the stones and got me out ! You have no clue what you 're talking about ! Stop this now , please ! I am going to save every one of those hostages , and I 'm going to retake this ship . Do you understand me ? All right , Telford has convinced her that he is still with them , otherwise he would be dead by now . Sooner or later he will make his move . So ... We are to gamble this ship and all of our lives in the hope that some traitor has had a change of heart . Look at that . I guess those elevators go more than just up and down . Come on . Right there . You good ? Yeah . I must have hit a few buttons I wasn 't supposed to press . Is the air getting thin ? Life support isn 't working out here . How do you know ? I was the one who shut it off . Rush 's orders . I mean , there 's air . There isn 't any new air being pumped in . So we need to keep moving . Yeah . Okay ? I don 't know if I can . No problem . I got you . This is my Lieutenant , Varro . Save him . He 's badly wounded . At even the slightest hint of trouble , Lieutenant ... I 'll bring you back , sir . I need to speak to general O 'Neill . Second-guessing a decision is a waste of time . I 'm not there . But I 'm starting to wonder if maybe I should be . I can 't speak to that , sir . This should be done , Colonel . Over . Yes , sir . At the time , I believed that venting the gateroom would kill both Dr. Rush and Colonel Telford . They deserved a chance ... We lost two 302 pilots sent to stop the attack . I 'm sorry . Colonel carter knew she 'd lose her ship if she tried to save them , but it was the right decision . Yes , sir . Are you up for this , Everett ? Yes , sir . Because somebody will take your place if you 're not . I 'm not going to let anybody take that ship , sir . Then get your ass back there . We 're good . What are you doing ? Just checking to make sure we 're headed in the right direction . This way . There 's no countdown . What ? We dropped out of FTL because someone was gating in . Why haven 't we jumped back ? Someone just activated a console in one of the access corridors . Colonel , a console just came on using Telford 's code . There 's a cordoned-off section coming our way . That 's his move . It 's cold . Really ? Okay ... We have to be careful moving through sections . There 's a reason we 've never been out this far ... A ton of compartments are de-pressurized . Okay ? Thank you . Hang on . Okay ... Ready ? Yeah . Okay . More dark and gloomy . We 're good . Gotcha . How are you doing ? I 'm doing good . You sure ? Stand by . Yes , sir , we 're good to go . Ready . Just give the word , sir . It 's locked down . I 'll handle it . Okay , get ready . What was that ? Ready . What happened ? You didn 't do that ? What is that ? Just a minute ago it was a man . You need to stand down till we figure this out . This is Young . Everybody stand down . Throw me a radio . Radio ? Three clicks , go to channel six . We 're going to have to try this again . Let 's stop . I 'm fine . Eli , you don 't ... Seriously , this is nothing . Once , I climbed the Redridge mountains on my way to Stonard with a full pack . Where 's that ? The World of Warcraft . That must 've given you quite the sense of accomplishment . Eli ... Okay , okay ... Okay , a little break , a little break . Yeah . All right , all right . So what do you think is happening ? We 've probably won by now . You think so ? If we won , then why haven 't we been rescued ? Well , first , they have to figure out what to do with the prisoners ... And then there 's that whole post-victory celebration . I mean , streamers everywhere . I 'm so tired . You 're still ... You 're still losing blood . I wasn 't able to stop it completely . Eli ... Hey . I 'm going to take care of you . It wasn 't them . I don 't know what happened to our man . But I know they had nothing to do with it . They don 't have anything that could do that to a person . Are you telling me they had nothing to do with this ? What happened ? Overload in the power relays proceeded by temporary disruption of all shipboard systems , lights to life support . How the hell did they manage that ? They didn 't . Well , then , what caused it ? That 's what I 'm trying to figure out . They 're making their move . It wouldn 't be that obvious . Colonel Young . Would you care to tell me what 's going on ? We don 't know . One of my men is dead . You need to know that we had nothing to do with that . Yes , so I 'm told . I 'm going to ask for a show of good faith . What do you want ? Colonel ? Lieutenant . How are you ? I 'm fine . We 're all fine . What is it that they want ? Some of their people are injured badly . I 'm going to need medical supplies to help them . What will this accomplish ? A goodwill gesture doesn 't have to accomplish anything . Of course it does ! So they lack medical supplies . Who knows what else they might lack ? Food ? Water ? They 'll get desperate , make their move , and when they do , they 'll be dealing with the hostages first . There 's only one way this is going to end if we wait . How do you know that ? We don 't even know what 's going on with the ship ! All the more reason to act now . Rush is right . We have to take them down , and we have to do it right now .

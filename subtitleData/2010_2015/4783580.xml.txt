 'It 's a comic ? ' No , it 's a graphic novel . It 's called Utopia Experiments . You had this . Where is it ? It 's just one of those conspiracy theories . - What about Utopia , then ? - Tell him , Becky . Utopia Part Two , there must be something in it that they want . I also live with my mum . Jesus Christ ! You 're going to make me cry now , Ian . I 'm mission ? You should persuade him to take it . What about the vaccine ? Russian flu . I think we could reconsider . He signed . He 's fucking resigning , Michael . My mate 's going to ask you a question . Where is Jessica Hyde ? My name is Jessica Hyde . Come with me now or you 'll all die . Who are you and what 's going on ? Ian , don 't point that gun at me . How ... how do you know my name ? Jessica Hyde ? Wilson ? They did this . We all have to go now . We 're not going anywhere until you tell us who you are , how you know my name and what the fuck is going on . Ian , you won 't be able to shoot me . Yeah ? Don 't imagine I won 't , " Jess " . No , really , you won 't be able to shoot me . You 've got the safety catch on . They don 't generally have safety catches , except on telly . Every second we stay here is a second they are getting closer and they 'll kill us all . Please , come with me . What about my dad ? He 's going home . I 've arranged for someone to pick up your dad from where he works . You don 't know where he works . Davingdon 's on Vesta Road . They 're picking him up now . I promise . I 'm not sure about this . You two ready ? Yeah , we 're ready . There 's CCTV at both ends of your street . We 'll go through the back . Stay there . What if someone 's in ? Social uprest if prices continue to rise . The Shadow Home Secretary has suggested the Government 's apparent lack of planning could lead to outbreak of ... Is this your car ? You 're so cute . Are you going to tell us what 's going on ? Who 's after us ? In the 1970s , the Soviets set up a germ warfare programme called Biopreparat . It was huge . They were weaponising anthrax , Ebola , smallpox , on a massive scale . The West panicked and created an organisation to combat the threat . It was known as The Network . It was based in no country , reported to no-one and was utterly deniable . It did things democratic governments couldn 't . They were insane , totally out of control . What 's that got to do with us ? Basically , that 's who 's after you . You 're fucking joking , right ? Right . Do you know where that is yet ? No . I 'll come later , anyway . Gimmme the gun . We need clothes and money . Your accounts are useless now . You 're going to rob them ? Let me make this very clear . Your lives as you knew them are over . What the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew or thought you could rely on and adjusting to the new reality . If you can adjust you will live . If you can 't you will die . Now we need to change the way you look . We need to get very far away and we need drugs for Wilson . Give me the gun . Ian , hang on , can we talk about this ? I mean , it 's an armed robbery . It 's adjust or die , Ian . I don 't know what to think of her . You could 've fooled me . You 've gotta be fucking kidding me . What , you just going to watch , are you ? Here . Diamorphine . What , heroin ? It 's a painkiller . Do for now . You look good . Should wear that colour more often . You look shit . But in a good way . We need to get out of the city . We 'll transfer to a van to keep Wilson out of sight , then burn this out . Do you have the manuscript , Ian ? Utopia Part Two . You need to tell me if you have it . We don 't . Bejan never turned up . I haven 't got Wilson 's father . I need to do things to keep us alive . Some of those things you wouldn 't normally approve of . This is insane . Yesterday I was arrested for a sex crime , today I 'm on the run from ex-government nutters who want to pull out my eyes . I 'm a fucking IT consultant . Geoff ? Hmmm ? Have you seen this ? Oh yes . Those bastards have got real a bee in their bonnet about the bloody vaccine . But they 've named me . Well , you did buy it , Michael . In any case , there 's nothing we can do about it . We 're tied into the contract . Well ... we 're not , actually . I 've found a cancellation clause . It can be enacted if the department 's total spend with the supplier is over 240 million . It 's to ensure diversity of supply . Yeah , but this is only 83 million , Michael , I mean ... No , but it 's total spend . We get two other vaccines from Corvadt . Plus a wide range of antibiotics , cytotoxics , hypoglycaemics ... I mean , this puts us well over 240 mil . Have the contracts sent to me immediately . No-one to see them . Look , whatever Corvadt are paying you , we are not going to get away with it . We can stop all this . We can stop it all now . It 's horrendous trying to conceive , isn 't it ? The medical nature of it all , the IVF , all that science . A man needs warmth . So I understand you fucking a prostitute , I do . What I don 't understand is you getting her pregnant . Do you think your wife will understand ? Get the contract straight over to me now . It 's for the best . Ian and I are going up ahead to ... Great . Have fun . Where are we going ? I hack airline companies , look for people going on holiday , stay at their houses . They never know . This is connected to a trip wire in the drive . Have everything by the back door , always be ready to leave within 60 seconds . What if you 're in the bath ? No baths , no showers . It 's time to stop worrying about looking pretty , Becky . Are you trying to wind me up ? There 'd be no value to that that I can see . You got a thing for tough women , is it ? Don 't worry , Ian . I get it . Imagine her big , strong arms around you.What ? You let us walk into this . I mean , how much did you know ? Because we had no idea . Look at Wilson 's face . And that is not my fault ! Tell that to his dad . Because she doesn 't have him , by the way . Tell us the truth . All of it , not bits , not pieces , all . Or I leave . Would you at least like to sit down first , Becky ? No , Jessica . I fucking wouldn 't . The Network was created by two men . A geneticist called Philip Carvel , and someone called Mr Rabbit ... Mr Rabbit ? It 's a codename , no-one knows the real identity . When the cold war began to wind down , the various governments involved decided to back away . Only thing was , Mr Rabbit and Carvel had no intention of stopping . At some point , Carvel wanted out . So they tortured him to keep him working and held his daughter hostage . Eventually , his mind snapped and he went mad . He was going be got rid of but somehow he was smuggled out , given a new name and hidden in a psychiatric hospital . The hospital was Shenley . And the new name was Mark Dane . What , you ... you mean Carvel wrote Utopia ? A therapist got him drawing . What he drew was ... incredible . So all the things in Utopia are real ? What , like BSE , they created that ? It 's hard to say what 's real and what 's not . But , yeah . BSE was theirs . How do you know all this ? I 'm Philip Carvel 's daughter . I was smuggled out with him when I was four . I 've been on the run ever since . Did you pricks give me heroin ? We had to , for the pain . Oh . Hope it wasn 't Afghan . Taliban have been altering it for years to make us infertile . Everyone knows that . We need to find Utopia . We start with where it came from . What ? What about the others ? It 's fine . I left a note . " Back soon , don 't have a bath . " Look , Wilson needs someone to ... That is not the reason ! Don 't you see what she 's doing ? She 's trying to divide us ! - Becky , that makes no sense . - Then why take you and not me ? Because you 're not strong enough . I can 't risk taking you . I know stuff . I know more than he does . What about Corvadt ? They 're involved , they gave people disease . What about Corvadt ? They 're involved , so what ? They 're a bit player . You 're not ready , Becky . - Look , you just need time to ... - Right , go on then . Fuck off ! What 's that ? It 's nothing . It 's work . Don 't worry . 'I very scared . ' I know , I mean ... They find out I pregnant , they angry . You just have to get me some time . Michael , I think I watched . Watched ? By who ? Don 't know . I scared . They come now . Michael , you help , yes ? You good man , yes ... ? Michael Dugdale ? My name 's William Kaye , I 'm a journalist , I want to talk about the flu vaccine . - No , no , I 'm sorry ... - Listen to me ! Your life is in danger . This isn 't about a fucking story ! If I just wanted a story , I 'd report the fact that you 've got a Russian prostitute pregnant . There 's my card . Things are going to get mad . You 'll need me when they do . Bejan got Utopia from the comic shop . They got it from a dealer in Scotland ... who is now dead . And he got it from this guy , Jack Tate . And who 's Jack Tate ? The man who published Utopia . Mrs Tate ? Yes . We need to speak to your husband . Right . My ... husband 's dead . Do you want to come in ? This was his study . Can you tell us where he died ? The A22 under the Hailsham Bridge . He walked out in front of a lorry . I 'm sorry . Do you miss him ? Of course I miss him . Actually , I have something you might be interested in . Yes , it 's a ... thing , I can 't describe it , papers and drawings . That sounds like exactly the sort of thing we 're looking for . We have to get out of here , now . What ? Why ? You might want these papers ... What the fuck have you done ? ! She 's with them . What ? What are you talking about ? Police turn up asking to see your dead husband and you don 't ask why ? Ah , shit . Glock 22 . She 's CIA . It means she knows next to fucking nothing . That 's how they work . They have people high up who get their drones to do their work for them . You 're going to answer my questions . And if I think you 've told me even one lie ... I 'll put this wire in the water ... plug this in , flip the switch . Understand ? Why are you here ? We got a tip-off . The man who lived here has been wanted on terrorism charges for over 25 years . We were too late , he 'd killed already himself , so ... so we took his wife in . Has the wife given you any information ? I don 't know . What did she say when you got here ? On the day he died he was talking crazy , he wasn 't making sense , he said he 'd been visited by a tramp ... " A tramp " ? " A tramp " or " THE tramp " ? I don 't know , " the " maybe , or ... ? Look , hang on ... I asked you a question . Was it " a tramp " , or " the tramp " ? " The " . It was " the " , definitely " the " . She said " the " . - A select committee ? - Yes . With powers to look into all aspects of the acquisition process . This is not going away , Geoff . They 're announcing it tomorrow . Do nothing . Keep quiet . The morning will bring something new . It always does . Geoff , we can 't do nothing ! Well , it 's sort of an order , actually . Worry less . Look , I know it 's scary now . But tomorrow you 'll be a hero , I promise . You didn 't call in . We were worried . You 're not agency . Who are you ? No . I 'm not agency . I 'm a specialist . What did you tell them ? What did I tell them ? They were going to fucking fry me , what do you think I told them ? I told them everything I knew . Was it her ? Yeah . Yeah , it was her . She was with a young black male , 25 , 28 . Was a young man there ? Messed-up face , missing an eye ? Er ... no . No , just them . Look , are you going to untie me ? Wow . That looks great . It 's like , um , pirate chic . How 's your sight ? Er ... I can see shapes and colours . Thanks for looking after me , Becky . Where 's my dad ? She lied . She had to get us out , Wilson . I mean , he 's probably fine . I need to find out . We can 't . They 'll be monitoring our families , we 'll put them in danger ... Look online , I 'll show you how to disguise the search . I swear they won 't know it came from here . Wilson , we can 't . I need to know . Please . His name 's Milton . Milton ? Milton Wilson ? What is it with your family and names ? Right , you 're sure they can 't trace this ? Positive . He 's a cricket nut , he logs in every day . You 'll see whether or not he 's logged in . Is he there ? Hang on , I 'm not in yet . Is he there ? Er ... Yeah . Yeah , yeah , he 's there , he 's fine . Grant has the manuscript . I heard them talking about it , they mentioned him . I weren 't going to fucking tell her . Who are you , then ? I 'm Alice . What are you doing ? You 're not from this school . Just fuck off before you get hurt ! I 'm not scared of you ! What 's that ? Comic . Well ? Are you going to show me or are you going to be a twat all day ? Are you going to tell me your name , then , twat ? Grant . Pleased to meet you , Grant . Alice . Shit ! Don 't go . Same time tomorrow , twat . Are you sure this 'll work ? Fanaticomix ? Grant 's addicted to it . It 's nerd heaven . And you have to read the personals or you miss the good stuff . I don 't , but other people do . But what if they 're monitoring it ? Say to meet at the Embassy . Dane based the Embassy on the Taunton building on the Kame Hill Estate . Only a real twat would know that . And me . Never deny your inner twat , Wilson . It 's part of your charm . Oh . 20 ... and then six plus something equals 20 ... Don 't forget to brush . I won 't . Good night , Mummy . Sleep tight , darling . Love you . ♪ Der ♪ Der der ♪ Der ♪ Der der ♪ Der ♪ Der der . ♪ What are you doing ? Can I sleep on your floor ? I won 't do nothing , I promise . Have you got that comic ? This is so beautiful . Yeah . And that 's part two . No-one 's ever seen that , just you and me . You 're quite surprising , you know . You strike me more as a Spider-Man type . Oh , we should sleep . If my mum sees a light , she 'll come in . Twat . Thanks for letting me read Utopia . Just to look after , like . Keep it under your bed . I-I-I 'll come back ... for that . Did they come back last night ? Nope . Wankers . What we going to do ? I know what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to have a fucking bath . 'We 're getting more information 'on our breaking news story - 'the outbreak of flu in the Shetland Islands . 'We can confirm two more people have now died 'bringing the death toll to 11 . 'That 's 11 now dead on the Shetland Island of Fetlar 'from the suspected outbreak of Russian flu . ' Shit ! 18 dead , 33 infected . There 's only 86 on the island . Geoff 's ordered a quarantine . No-one gets in or out . Right . If it 's a new strain , it 's got infection rates already of 58 % . Michael , thank god you got the vaccine . You 're a fucking hero . You tell them my name ? Did you tell them my fucking name ? No , no , I didn 't say anything . I think they 're on to me . I think I 'm being followed . I saw two men . Jesus Christ ! Have you seen the news ? It 's happening . I told you . What do I do ? I mean , people are dying ! We need a sample of the vaccine . You can request one direct from Corvadt . It 's within your remit as advisor . There 's a man in Sheffield . A scientist called Donaldson . Get it to him . What about you ? What about you ? Do exactly as I fucking say ! The Tramp used to be a scientist with the Network . He got out . Now he monitors their activities . He has to keep under the radar to stay alive . I reckon that 's his office . A public phone ? Here we go . Him ? But ... He really is a tramp ? Yeah , he 's called ' The Tramp ' , Ian . Hello , Danny . Oh , shit ! Oh ! Fucking hell ! You nearly broke my nose . You nearly broke my fucking nose ! Jessica , how lovely . How did you know Utopia had a part two ? He 's on our side , isn 't he ? There 's no sides . Just people who help you and people who don 't . Now , now , Jess , you know a gentleman never reveals his ... Don 't make me ask you again , Danny . Jack told me years ago . I went to see him now because I wanted part two . I knew Jack from the old days , you see . Why ? What 's in it ? He never told me , and when your father died it didn 't matter any more but now they have something . Your father was working on a project called Janus before he died . They 've replicated his research . They have it . They 're going to test it . And what does Janus do ? I swear I don 't know . The last thing your father was working on were viral delivery vectors that attack the human genome . And Tate ? What did he say ? He said that this is the end . He said we are all finished . And he took his own life . We need to work together , Jess , you and I ... What I still don 't get is what you were going to do with it . I mean , what use would it be to a decrepit old sack of filth like you ? What do you think your last breath will feel like , Danny ? There 's a woman . MI5 . They already have MI5 . Not this one . She 's like us . Works in secret , trusts no-one . She can help . Now , Jess , if you get me the manuscript I can get it to her . What 's her name ? Please don 't make me tell you that , Jessica . Milner . Her name 's Milner . She 's a good woman , Jessica . Ian , we need a vehicle . You 've seen me enough times . It 's time for you to do it . Why didn 't he give it to you ? Bit odd ? I 'm on your side , Jessica , you know that . I 'm one of the ... If we found him , they would . He gave up Milner 's name like that . You saw what they did to Wilson . So you just killed him ? - I pulled up the ladder . - What ? You fucking killed him ! You took his life ! You just kill people if they 're not convenient , is that it ? Why are you being so odd ? What the fuck are you doing ? They ... They just came in . So you tied them up ? Children ? You tied up children ? We 're making it look like a burglary ! You did the right thing . We meet here tomorrow , 10pm . Keep Wilson out of sight . Stay on country roads , avoid CCTV . You did exactly the right thing . So , I-I-I want a sample of the vaccine . I-I-I 'm sure you understand , with the events of last night . So , this is an R680 request ... Excellent , yes . You want a sample . Yes , it 's all filled . It 's all in order . The paperwork is ... What do you want it for ? You are contractually obliged to supply a sample within 48 hours . Yes , of course . Something wrong ? No , no , nothing 's wrong . I just need ... I want a sample . I can do that . 'Freelance journalist , William Kaye has been murdered 'in a car park in Wapping in East London , 'in what is being described by police as a gangland-style execution . 'Mr Kaye was shot three times in the chest and once in the head . 'Police have a suspect in custody , 'a Russian National named as Anya Lutchenko . ' Anya ? ! 'Police have described her as a sex worker . The detective ... ' How 's your wife , Dugdale ? Still trying to conceive , are you ? Still trying for a little baby ? Forget the vaccine , Mr Dugdale .

Bloody hell , you sound about ten . Close . He 's 11 . What ? Really ? You said you owned a Porsche and that your girlfriend was a supermodel . Yeah , I 've got ambitions . Stay here and be nice , both of you . She got a boyfriend ? I 'm just going to get some water for us from the shop , OK ? It 's me . The manuscript exists . The boy . The boy knows where it is .

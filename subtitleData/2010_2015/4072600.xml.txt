 ( blowtorch sizzling ) rescue team is in the main service corridor . colonel . - What 's it look like in there ? - The main power is out . - Switching to night vision . - Man # 2 : Oh my dear God . we have massive casualties over here . control : confirmed . We expected that when we saw the hull damage . control . It almost looks like a wild animal tore through the crew . - Man # 2 : What the hell happened here ? - ( rapid beeping ) I 'm showing four live ones . - Four ? There 's supposed to be 137 crewmen . Raiders never hit a ship this big before . marines . Private . They 're in engineering . Near the shock point core . marines . look out ! - What 's happening ? - The engines are firing . How is that possible ? ( whispering voices ) It 's over . They 're dead . Finally . ( sobbing ) lt 's finished . It 's not finished . This is too big to end here . We 've been in contact with a higher power . Stross . You can 't see because you 're not a true vessel . Will you two shut the hell up ? ! all right ? - We 've got to get- - - Quiet . - Listen . Do you hear that ? - ( banging ) Woman : Oh my God . They 've come for us . It can 't be more of them . We destroyed that damn thing . I won 't let them hurt her . This is Abraxis Rescue Team . Identify yourselves . - Thank God you 're here . - l knew they 'd come . chief medical officer of the USG O 'Bannon . You just get away now . Nobody 's taking my baby away from me again . Drop the weapon now ! don 't do it . you have no idea - what we 've been through . - ( grunting ) didn 't they ? They think that they can control this . They are all fools. can 't you see ? It 's already happening . convergence is here . We shall all be made whole ! Aggh ! Fools . we 've got one blue casualty and four survivors in custody . Bringing ' em in . ( mechanical whirring ) Man # 1 : What the fuck do you think really happened over there ? The bodies had these looks on their faces like whatever killed those people drove ' em crazy first . Man # 2 : What 's command saying ? Man # 1 : command 's treating the whole thing as a navigational accident . Accident my ass . Man # 3 : It almost looked like they killed each other . something went seriously fubar out there and the big guys back home are trying to cover their big fat ass- - excuse us . We didn 't see you . They sent an interrogation unit all the way out here ? Man # 3 : What kind of shit did those bastards from the O 'Bannon get into ? but they are righteously fucked now . Scans confirm the target has been destroyed . It 's unrecoverable . but not a complete loss . I 'm afraid . I 'm informed our specialist is among them . sir . I am authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques . I see . Do you think that will be necessary ? We don 't have time for subtlety . There have been questions raised about what happened at Aegis 7 . people will demand answers . I shall be forced to re-evaluate my confidence in your abilities . sir . You have seven hours before your ship docks at the Sprawl . This situation needs to be resolved by then . I understand perfectly . What are you standing around for ? Have the first subject brought in . It 's time to go to work . - inside us- - the patterns . - Hey ! - Guards ! - l see it all now . - Will somebody talk to me ? - Human life is only a passing phase . is anybody out there ? somebody open this door . we 're safe now . Everything 's gonna be just fine . Soon we 'll be back with Mommy and then we 'll all be together . Man : This is fucking crazy . it just doesn 't make any goddamn sense . We survived that horror show back on the O 'Bannon just to be locked up here ? You know the reason we 're in here is because that fucking lunatic shot a marine . it 's him . baby girl . He 's just a little scared . Don 't pay any mind . I don 't have anything to do with this crazy bastard . will you calm down ? You 're not helping matters . They have deeper reasons for detaining us Mr. Borges . There 's a great design behind everything that 's happened . And we 're each a part of it now . am I the only one who didn 't go batshit crazy back on that damn planet ? Stross is right about one thing . We might have a problem . I did a tour on one of these with a med unit a few years ago . We 're on board a government interceptor ship in a holding cell where they detain terrorists . So what does that mean ? It means the government might want someone to blame for what happened on the O 'Bannon . Alejandro . This may well be the last time we see each other . Don 't touch me ! what 's the matter ? it 's about fucking time . What 's going on ? - Why are you holding us here ? - Step back . take it easy . - you will come with us . - Huh-uh . I 'm not leaving my little girl . okay ? Get your hands off me ! I 'm not letting you take me away from her . - ( electricity crackles ) - ( screams ) Stop . Stop it ! He 's had enough . You 'll kill him . - What the hell is going on ? - l don 't know . ( whispering voices ) God damn it . can 't you see her ? if you please . - She 's right there . - ( electricity crackles ) - ( screams ) she needs me . I have to protect her . She needs her father . Vivian ! Let me go ! Let me go ! please calm yourself . We have some questions . I 'm not telling you shit until I see my daughter . the mind holds countless rational and irrational fears . the fear is being burned alive . - ( beeps ) - ( gasps ) No ! No ! ( screaming ) ( panting ) is it not ? State your name and occupation . security officer on the cDc O 'Bannon . What the hell do you want from me ? Mr. Kuttner . We are going to ask the questions . You are going to answer them honestly and completely . Do you understand ? I understand . We want you to start from the beginning . We want you tell us about the mission to Aegis 7 . Aegis 7 . The O 'Bannon got word to ship out about a week ago . where we picked up a team of civilian tech heads . Mission specs were sealed so nobody knew where we were headed . the captain called a briefing . Mr. Kuttner ? She 's beautiful . My son has the exact same color eyes . Stross . Nolan . His little girl died in an accident back home a few weeks ago . that 's terrible . I don 't know what I 'd do if anything happened to my little boy . girl ? I saw your wife earlier . She seemed a little stressed . Alexis is always stressed . wanna go grab a drink at the Hole after this ? They got 12-credit specials after 0500 . I 'm sorry. I can 't . I 've got two rookies with artificial gravity sickness to deal with . Doc . you 'll never get a man interested in you . I think starting any mission without a drink or six is a bad idea . I 'll grab a beer with you if the offer 's open . why not ? thank you very much . first class . So what do you guys know about this mission I don 't ? Mr. Nayim . I didn 't realize you were on this ship . sir . I 'm Alejandro Borges with the engineering team from Titan Station . I understood this was just a routine gravimetric stabilization gig . What 's with all the secrecy ? son . This is big time . It must be . Dragging our sorry asses all the way to the edge of the galaxy- - people . captain . Good morning . This is why we 're here . - l 'm here ' cause it 's double wages . - ( chuckles ) The planet is Aegis 7 . It was virtually destroyed in a mining accident three weeks ago . the impact has made the planet unstable . - Unstable ? - Damn ! That 's where we come in . Ourjob is to hold Aegis 7 together . Borges : You 've got to be kidding ! There is no way- - The captain is not yet finished speaking . eight drop ships will deliver gravity stabilizers to these key points . The artificial gravity web generated should be enough to stabilize the planet . Are you serious ? With only eight units ? That planet is practically one huge bomb ready to explode . How long do you think a few gravity stabilizers will hold something like that together ? Mr. Borges . It 's too late for you to back out now . Any other questions ? captain ? 0500 . Dismissed . we would like to speak with you . I understand some of you have heard rumors about what happened on Aegis 7 . You can speak freely . Rin : I 've heard they found something on the planet surface so terrible a guy called clarke dropped a whole continent on it . Something- - something alien . - Bullshit . - captain : The rumors are true . They discovered an alien artifact 65 million years old . cho : My God ! It 's actually real ? Kuttner : What the hell is it ? Sergenko : No one knows for sure . It 's supposed to contain certain properties . What kind of properties ? even to me . And I assume the artifact was destroyed upon impact . but satellite imaging reveals fragments have survived . Your team 's mission is to locate and secure whatever can be salvaged of the artifact . On a planet that could explode any minute ? Mr. Kuttner . captain . Just how much are these fragments worth ? Two million credits a kilo . l hear Aegis 7 is beautiful this time of year . prepare for launch . - Nayim : We 're dropping in three . - You 're playing hologames I can 't pause it right now . Aren 't you a little young to be on this operation anyway ? - ( laughs ) - My cousin 's a genius at two things : hologames and gravity stabilizers . what are you guys doing here ? You 're not engineers . We 're surveying for gravity fluctuations . Fluctuations ? The whole planet 's one big goddamn fluctuation . What the hell are you surveying ? Locking onto gravity stabilizer . Releasing docking clamps . kiddies . drop . Nayim : Entering lower atmosphere . folks . Yee-haw ! level us out ! ( explosion ) Kuttner : Will you look at that ? Borges : God damn ! cho : Holy shit ! This isn 't a planet . It 's a freakin ' disaster in process . Borges : This is nearly total gravimetric and geothermal disruption . It seems impossible the planet 's held together this long . Almost as if- - - As if what ? - Nothing . Nothing at all . I need more data . ourjob is to keep that stabilizer from overloading . Let these guys go do whatever the fuck it is they 're really doing here . The scanners are calibrated to the frequency of the mortar fragments . Sweep out in branching formation . Maintain radio contact at all times . Any questions ? Back here at 0900 . - ( explosion ) - Ho ! come in . This rock is getting more unstable by the minute and I haven 't found a damn thing . I 've lost track of your signal . do you read me ? you copy ? come in . I 've got something . ( panting ) I think . I gotta be right on top of it . Will you look at this ? ( whispering voices ) ( screaming ) Oh God ! This is- - ( wailing ) What is it ? I don 't- - l don 't understand . Ahhhh ! Vivian : ♪ Twinkle twinkle ♪ ♪ Little star ♪ - ♪ How I wonder what you are . ♪ - lt can 't be . Papa ? What are human beings ? wait ! Where did you go ? Daddy will always keep you safe . - That 's what you said to me . - ( whooshes ) ( woman screams ) ( screams ) not again ! This isn 't possible . This isn 't possible . Kuttner . - Rin . - Where the hell are you ? Sergenko wants us back at the ship . This place is coming apart . do you copy ? Yeah . I copy . - Rin out . - Papa ? - Vivian . Papa . I miss you too . - Why didn 't you take care of me ? - ( growling ) I tried to take- - no ! Get away from her . no ! No ! Vivian . What 's happening ? ( screams ) Get away from me . Get away from me ! what 's with you ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . all I got from you was static . What happened ? I 'm not sure . I saw- - what 's wrong ? Are you in pain ? He 's been acting weird since I found him . - ( screeching ) - lt could be his suit pressure . What do you want ? Keep away from me . Kutt . Everything 's cool . what is that in your hand ? - Borges : It looks like a fragment . - Vivian : Papa ! Vivian ! Papa . - No ! Vivian ! stand down . - Leave me alone . They 've got my daughter and I 'm gonna save her . - Vivian ! - cho : Someone stop him . where are you going ? - Vivian ! Stross : He 's got a piece of the artifact. lt 's affecting his mind . Sergenko : Get after him . what are you doing here ? man . We got a problem with the power flow . - Papa ! - Vivian ? help me . Keep away from my daughter . - ( grunting ) - What 's he doing ? He 's gone nuts ! Vivian . I won 't let you have her . Leave her alone ! - ( growling ) - Get away from my- - Papa ! Leave her alone ! ( groaning ) My head . What happened ? honey ? no ! Shh ! Don 't speak . You 'll be okay . I need help here ! Pawling . What happened ? - Did the monsters get him ? - You bastard ! ( grunts ) Nick . What have you done ? lock Kuttner in the ship now . The stabilizer 's overloading . can you hear me ? Noah ! - Let me see him . - Noah ! you have to let me see him . ( groaning ) Stross : Make sure those bonds are secure . The artifact 's influence can cause homicidal outbursts . huh ? What 's really going on here ? where 's Vivian ? We can 't leave without my daughter . What the hell happened to him out there ? Papa . Vivian ! Vivian ! No ! No ! Let me go ! Let me go . No ! No ! Let me go ! - Let me go . She needs me . Let me go ! - ( beeps ) - ( electricity crackles ) - ( screams ) ( Vivian laughing ) baby girl . - Prep the subject for cryosleep . - Wait . Woman : Yes sir . Mr. Kuttner will be of great use to us . restrain the subject . Guard : Hold it right there ! What do you think you 're doing ? please . I was ordered to do it . You won 't take me away from her . She needs her father . I have to find her . I have to keep her safe . you fool . Alert security . Tell them he must not be harmed . Vivian ! Vivian ? baby . Don 't be afraid . - ( groaning ) - ( Vivian humming ) Vivian . Wait . Vivian . come back . baby girl . Just please . Please wait for me . Where did you go ? - Papa . - Viv . No ! Don 't- - don 't leave me . Don 't leave me again . ( beeps ) get up . Papa . Daddy . Pumpkin . Papa . They 're coming . They wanna take you away from me . Daddy . come to me . We can be together . Together . Always . Papa . Always and forever . - There he is . - What 's he doing ? - He 's opening the airlock ! - He 's gone crazy . Stop him ! No ! Vivian : ♪ Twinkle twinkle ♪ ♪ Little star ♪ ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ - ♪ Like a diamond in the sky . ♪ - Always and forever . He came into direct contact with a shard . The Overseer will not be pleased . But we still have the others . Bring in Alejandro Borges . wiser . We will become . We must become . man . I will pay you real money to just shut the fuck up . What do you think those alarms were all about ? Kuttner 's dead . Stop it . You don 't know that . But I do . I can sense it . We are all one . a passing dream . Doc . ( panting ) ( whimpering ) ( screams ) Mr. Borges ? anything . Just no more spiders . Man : Tell us about the disaster on Aegis 7 . Tell us about the shard . I ... didn 't even know about the damn shard . I was just there to do a job . ourjob is to keep that stabilizer from overloading . Let these guys go do whatever the fuck it is they 're really doing here . Something 's up with their little expedition . Suspicious as hell . Nayim : What do you mean ? They 're here to measure gravity fluctuations ? - l don 't buy it for a second . - ( loud rumbling ) The planet 's breaking up . Move your asses . We got work to do . Pawling : Looks like I 'm gonna have an interesting first day on the job . Nayim : I knew six stabilizers couldn 't hold it . Borges : We 've got to hold her . There are still teams on the ground . Pawling : The power flow 's out of balance . do you have it ? - Just a second . Almost there . - Noah ! kid. I 'm impressed . - That 's my coz . - Whoa ! Whoa there ! big boy . That 's it . dead . there 's gotta be a harder setting than impossible . the movie was better . how did you end up with that arm ? really . Mining accident. I lost it when a grav stabilizer I was working blew . Nayim . Alejandro there saved five guys off that rig . He 's a hero . We lost 15 men that day . I 'm no hero . I 'm sorry . Life takes us strange places . I was going to be a priest when I was young . Omar ? You really believe aliens - created the human race ? - Look at us . We have perfect symmetry and a brain as powerful as the most advanced computer . And this came out of nothing ? ( coughs ) Bullshit . but human life was created we return to them . - Grav flux is starting up again . - We 've got an overload . Nayim : Gravity web is destabilizing . She won 't hold . We could drop a dozen stabilizers on this planet and it still wouldn 't keep what 's left from blowing . Borges : We need to hold it until the teams get back . can you balance the flow ? what are you doing here ? - ( Kuttner muttering ) - What 's he doing ? - l won 't let you ! - ( grunting ) - Omar . man ? Vivian . run ! - Who 's Vivian ? What the hell are you talking about ? Monster ! Get away from her ! - Almost got it . There ! - Noah . we 're stable . I 'll kill you. I 'll kill you all . No ! Noah ! Oh my God . Oh my God . Noah . - Stabilize . - Don 't speak . You 'll be okay . I need help here ! What happened ? Did the monsters get him ? You bastard ! can you hear me ? Noah ! you have to let me see him . He 's bleeding out . We have to get him back to the ship . is he gonna be okay ? - l 'm so sorry . - ( explosion ) Nayim : The stabilizer is overloading. I can 't hold it . they need you . Nayim : The whole power grid is failing . my friend . Automatic systems are a total loss . It 's a cascade failure . There 's nothing we can do . - We have to get out of here . - This is Sergenko . All units evacuate . everyone . move it ! get to the ship now ! The lava is flowing this way . That 's Nolan and Rin up ahead . There 's a chasm ahead . come on ! Jump ! ( screaming ) - This way . - l can 't run anymore . - ( screams ) - Gotcha ! Thank you . Rin . - Rin ! Rin ! - ( screams ) Nolan . - l 'm okay . - Don 't stop . Get to the ship . I 'm sorry . You were a good soldier . hurry ! - commander Sergenko . - Too late . take this . It 's more important than you know . Protect it . all of you . That 's an order . Get on the ship . ( screams ) Sergenko ! - What is happening ? - Gravity increasing . ( screaming ) above you . Look out ! we can 't help him . - We have to go . - We must get to the ship . ( grunts ) What the fuck is happening ? you crazy motherfucker ! guys . We have to get off the planet . God damn it . Hold on . Stross : The planet 's going . Why is the engineer flying the goddamn ship ? okay ? - l think I 'm gonna throw up . - Aim for Kuttner . Shit ! We 've lost Shuttle 4 . We must get the shard back to the O 'Bannon . What are they doing ? The ship is too close to the planet . They need to clear the gravity well before they shock point out . That bastard 's not leaving us behind . Hold on ! we have to go faster . It 's tearing apart now . The engines- - look out for the engines . Hold on ! - cho : Borges ! - This is bullshit . We 're coming in too fast . I told you we shouldn 't have let him drive . Shit shit shit ! move it ! come on ! come on ! Are you all right ? Someone call medical . That son of a bitch ! Man : Full power to the engines . - Woman : No contact with survey teams . - ( crew chattering ) Are we far enough to shock point ? son . - We 've got a situation here . - She 's going . Emergency power to shock point drive . in eight ... - collision alert . five ... three ... - We 're not gonna make it . - two ... ( screaming ) - Look out ! - ( explosions ) Emergency thrusters . God damn it ! Firing thrusters . Damage report . Damage report ! Hull breach in section B. sir . vaporize any planetary debris send out a distress signal . those rocks will tear us to pieces . We won 't survive very long without the shock point drive . Ensign Voigt . get your team down to the engine room and repair that drive . I gave you an order . I 'm not fixing shit until you explain sir . What are you talking about ? Kuttner had some sort of psychotic breakdown . as were most of the engineering teams . all of you . I want a full damage report in five minutes . man your stations . The bodies have been taken to cold storage . Kuttner is under observation in sick bay . perhaps it would be best to keep the shard under quarantine until we know more about its properties . but- - You were hoping for more ? You sent us on a suicide mission for a lump of rock ? son . The high l.Q. boys back home say this will change the face of science itself- - And that 's worth all the people who died back there ? Alejandro. I 'm sure the captain couldn 't predict the shard 's influence on Kuttner . the shard- - it 's worth a lot of money . Enough for you to take care of Engineer Pawling 's family for the rest of their lives . You son of a bitch ! Alejandro . - ( loud bang ) - What the fuck was that ? Pieces of the planet are still impacting the ship . We need to get clear of the debris field . if I didn 't need you you would be in the brig for that . Now get your ass down to the engine room or we 're all dead ! Alejandro ? How old was Pawling ? cho : About 19 . l got you this job . It 's all my fault . And you never came into direct contact with the fragment ? I swear. I never touched the damn thing . Lie detection states 99.9 % truth . He never touched it . Mr. Borges . You 've been most cooperative . What 's happening ? We 'll have you escorted to guest quarters for the remainder of your trip to the Sprawl . You mean I can go ? Seriously ? but you 'll be back home to your family as soon as we dock . thank God . Thank you . Thank you . Mr. Borges . - l can 't believe it . l honestly thought I was a dead man . Have them remains taken to cold storage - and bring in Nolan Stross . - Yes sir . ( panting ) what are you doing ? Please don 't . Don 't do this ! No ! Stop ! Let me out ! No ! please let me out ! claustrophobia . Most horrible . Now I take it you 're ready to talk sense . We 're on a bit of a deadline . I 'm sure you understand . I understand- - better than you could possibly comprehend . you have been chief research scientist on the O 'Bannon for a little over a year now . two months and nine days . And all that while you 've also been clandestinely a part of our government 's secret investigation into the alien marker . is that correct ? That 's correct . they decided to send us in after the lshimura incident . I was to examine any fragments in the marker and make a thorough report . I see . Now why don 't you share with me the results of your investigation ? I went to check on my family . My family means a great deal to me . The shock point drive is down ? But how are we gonna get home without it ? Alexis . Don 't worry . Everything 's gonna be fine . level with me . Does all this have anything to do with that other research you 're doing ? can you please not grill me during the few moments a day I get with my son ? I need to go . The captain wants me to examine the artifact - we found on the planet . - What kind of artifact ? - The classified kind . - What about that doctor you 're always with ? is she classified too ? Alexis . You spend more time with her than with us . She 's a colleague . Why would I have brought you on this trip if there was anything going on ? Because you 're the senior science officer and I pestered to come along . - l 've gotta get to the lab . - You can 't keep running there every time I wanna have a discussion about our relationship . Don 't wait up . sweetie . ( shushing ) I 'm here . Mommy 's here . - ( knock on door ) - come in . I really should be starting the analysis of the shard . captain ? Mr. Stross . I nearly lost my ship recovering that damn thing . I know I 'm just supposed to turn it over to you . You 'll have to take that up with home base . I have . They tell me all matters connected with the shard are need-to-know only . My goddamn ship 's scientist needs to know more about this mission than I do apparently . but you don 't look well . It 's the shard . I can hear it talking to me . have you discussed this with Dr. cho ? ( loud rumbling ) you keep it in your lab . We 're in deep enough shit here as it is . It 's even more astonishing than I could have possibly imagined . Doctor ? The structure is similar to a hologram . Every particle contains all the information of the whole . What made this cuneiform-like symbol ? There 's no scratching or sign of cutting- - as if the crystal itself gave birth to it . What ? - What 's happening ? - ( voices whispering ) it 's- - my head . Some form of telepathic encoding ? are you feeling well ? I 'm fine . I 'm fine . a blueprint . what are you doing ? that will be all . we need to run Miss Burns . it 's the key a guide to DNA chains I 've never seen before . This may contain the secret to the future of human evolution . are you okay ? You seem a little hyperactive . this is the finding of a lifetime . ( kissing ) hmm ? - change everything . - Shh ! We 'll talk about that later . But right now ... ( laughs ) The shard seems to generate some sort of carrier wave so advanced my instruments can barely detect it . Though I have a theory that when it comes into contact possibly into a new and more evolved form . can you explain what happened to Kuttner on the planet ? it seems most humans when influenced by the marker become hyperpsychotic . Only a very small percent are resilient to its effects . Kuttner was already on the edge- - his grief over his daughter . The shard pushed him over into a delusional state . And you believe the shard was originally created by aliens ? what a primitive mind would call God . ( gasps ) he says . maybe you should get some sleep . Stross ? can you hear me ? ( voices whispering ) ( screams ) it emanates . I need a test subject . ( distant explosion ) Already the signal from the shard permeates the dead flesh of the subject . I 've never seen anything transform an entire host cell so quickly . It 's- - it 's beautiful . Damn it ! How can I be expected to complete my experiments under these conditions ? What ? That 's not possible . ( whispering voices ) - ( growls ) - ( screams ) Oh no ! Doctor . They will all suffer because of you . ( panting ) H-hallucination . It was just a hallucination . The door- - l broke the seal . I wasn 't thinking . ( gasps ) what have I done ? get out ! ( Sandra screams ) get away . It 's not my fault . The shard- - it tricked me . Leave me alone ! will ya ? - ( growling ) - lt 's still after me . it won 't find me in here . No ! no ! Oh God . - ( men screaming ) ( panting ) I need help . The captain . The captain . I have to tell you . It 's about the shard . Stross . I 've got the engine room on the horn . Borges . l barely have any engineers left . It 'll be a miracle if we can pull this thing off . I have taken all the shit- - - ( screaming ) - What the hell is going on ? - We 're under attack . Borges . Borges ! God damn it . take a security team down there . Stross ! Woman : We have a code 3 emergency in the engine room . All personnel report to their stations . this is not a drill . the baby . move it . Move it ! Oh oh God . ( screaming ) Alexis . are you here ? I made a horrible mistake . The shard . I 'm not thinking clearly . - ( baby cooing ) - Alexis ? is that you ? - ( screeching ) - Get off of me ! ( grunting ) - Where 's my son ? - Alexis : Nolan ! That 's my baby ! No ! You monster ! Get away from my family . ( screams ) ( panting ) Nolan . ( shouts ) ( panting ) something 's happening . The bodies- - they 're turning into creatures . It has to be the shard . Oh God . Oh my God . Seeing those dead creatures must have truly affected her . but I had to do it . Those things were threatening my family . where is your family now ? l- - l locked them in their quarters . Did your men find them ? Are they safe ? What about the baby ? - His heart rate is 160 . - l need to see them . convergence is coming . We have to be together where is your family ? I told you . you did . - ( beeps ) - ( electricity crackles ) - Where is your family ? Safe in quarters . Saved them- - l saved them . Interesting . I 've never seen such a complete block before . - Increase the voltage . - ( screaming ) I won 't ! I won 't remember . - You can 't make me remember . - Really quite extraordinary . ( beeps ) all of you . aren 't you ? Like you did Kuttner and Borges . Dr. Stross . - You don 't ? - Of course not . You came into direct contact with the marker . It actually communicated with you . Your mind holds the key to its language . You 're exactly what we 've been looking for . What is that ? What are you doing ? Please stop . I did everything I was asked to do . Why are you doing this to me ? Stop . Stop it . Please stop . please . Please please ! Interrogator : Unfortunate ... about the claustrophobia . sir ? Stross is everything they wanted . Not quite everything . Bring in Isabel cho . this is Abraxis . Abraxis . crying ) Doctor . We merely wish to know about the shard 's full effects upon the O 'Bannon 's crew . You 're talking to the wrong person . Nolan studied the artifact . And we want to know more about Nolan Stross . Did he reveal the details of his investigation to you ? - You were having an affair . - Why is that relevant ? I shall be forced to intensify my methods . Do you understand me ? Yes . Tell me about your affair with Dr. Stross . l- - the affair lasted several months . We 'd been working together for a year . I didn 't plan it . It was just something that happened . but I didn 't want him to . but I couldn 't . For the first time in my life I was in love . erratic . Do you know what 's the most fascinating thing Isabel ? - Hmm ? like a dream I 've nearly forgotten . I think you 've lost me . I only speak English and Korean . Isabel . I want you to come to sick bay . Let me run some psych scans . Remember what that thing did to Kuttner ? I don 't need psych scans . You have no comprehension of what I 'm doing here . I 've nearly grasped its sacred language- - the ultimate source of human life itself . you 're starting to scare me . I think it 's time for you to leave . I have work to do . All right . I need to check on Kuttner anyway . So how 's our patient today ? Doctor . Nickolas ? still can 't remember much . Do you remember seeing your daughter ? Of course . She 's out playing right now . - She 'll be back soon . - Of course she will . Those engineers better get the drive working . I need to get Vivian home to her mother . I 'm sure they 're doing their best. I have to go . okay ? all I see are monsters . Doctors . We have a dozen DOAs to process . Ripley and Wells should have finished the prep by now . The captain wants a full report by- - ( gasps ) oh my God . - Man : Good Lord . - The bodies are gone . What could have done this ? By the Great Marker . is that Dr. Ripley ? call the captain . - We 've got to- - - ( growling ) ( snarling ) Get out ! Get out ! Shut the door ! Run ! Get out of there ! - Shut the door ! - ls that door gonna hold ? - Did everyone get out ? - What is it ? - ( alarm blaring ) - Emergency stations .

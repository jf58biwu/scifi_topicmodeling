But if you really wanna talk about World Peace .. we have to start by tearing down that wall , that 's seperating us from Mexico . That wall - only enables us to ignore the violence and injustice that is occuring down there . Thus , making ' World Peace' nothing more than a beauty pageant pipe dream . God Bless , Texas .

He used to run with Los Quertos . Till , one day .. he wakes up and decides he 's gonna turn on the cartel . Funding from the people . We figure he is laying in the jungles and marsh lands but our Satellite cannot pinpoint him . Our only lead is this prize winner . Working girl . Goes by the name of Cereza .

You know , the first thing we are taught is how to defend ourselves . Anyone of us could 've killed you . You think my mom had fight ? Mendez is gonna cut you like a Gay man . - That was your Mother ? You are here to kill him , aren 't you ? Look , don 't be a fucking hero man . Mendez is many things . But , merciful is not one of ' em . He will skin you alive , if you lay your hands on me . I am his ' Cereza ' . His Virgin . Mendez isn 't who you think , he is . The terrible things he did . He did it for perfectly greater good ! What he truly wants , is a better Mexico . Mechete , you have to promise me . Spare his life . And help him . Please , Machete ? If you 've ever loved anyone . You would understand . Do nothing . Say , nothing . I 'll handle it . Who is this ? He 's a bodyguard . Mother 's orders . Go ahead , Zoren call it in . See , here 's the thing .

What did you think of my Cereza ? .. heh It 's a shame , I had to let her go . But , by bringing you here ... She betrayed me . She was trying to save you . You know what this is ? This is the end of my I-plan to fire off the ass of the united states . Why Mendez ? Cos our people don 't need songs or stories . They need ' action ' ! There is other ways . The motherfuckers run this country . The corrupt politicians .. The media hiding the truths ... The Cartels .. killing anything and anyone who stands in their path . The U.S - is responsible for a lot of these . Since , they will take care of their part of the problem ; We will send our part of the problem , to them ! You are crazy . I know why , you are here , Machete . You work for the enemy now , huh ? I got news for you , Cabron . Killing me ain 't in the card . Cos I am , the king fucking wrath of Mexico , Motherfucker . Thanks to my good Doctor here . The missile 's launch system , is linked ... right into my heart . So , if my heart stops beating . Washington will become the bright shining light , we always thought it was . I 'll disarm it . There is only two men in the world who knows how to do that . Correction - One . Who 's the other one ? The one who created this beautiful device , of course . Since , he lives in the U.S I 'm afraid you are fucked . You have failed . Machete , don 't fail . What you gonna do ? You wanna kill me ? I ain 't gonna kill you . I 'm gonna kill your men . Steal your chopper and get you over the wall . - Leave him to me . Find the other one , who can disarm you . Shoot me ! Let me take care of him . Please . Even if we get out of here alive , my men are instructed to put a bomb through my head . Ten Million dollars . The best part is ... Fail safe - my ticking heart . We just went live . We got 24 hours my friend . That 10 million dollars , if the assassins don 't get it .. the cartels will . - Yeah ? - What 's the status ? Is he dead ? I have Mendez in custody , in the chopper . He is alive . - Wait a second . Machete .. What 's this i hear about you having Mendez in custody ? - Thing 's got complicated . - No shit . You were supposed to take him out . not give him a joy ride , and get him some lollipop . Damn it ! I didn 't recruit you for your sense of compassion . Machete .. Kills ! That 's what he does . He doesn 't save .. the bad guys . Now , shoot that Motherfucker ! - If he dies , you die . The Missile 's wired to his heart . - Come , come again ? - Machete , can it be disarmed ? - Only , where it was made . - Voztech . - Voztech is the biggest weapon supplyer to our military . You wanna bring him back all the way to the fucking manufacturer ? I need your help getting him across the border . This part is upsetting me . - I 'm feeling it . - Not happening . The last time i sent a black ops team into Mexico , they got dead and i got the Oval Ass fuck . You are on your own , Machete . We cannot help you , until you 're out of Mexico , You hear me ? Now , get the hell out of there , As fast as you can . Machete , double time it to the border . I 'll assist you as much as possible .. But you 've got to move your ass ! What happened ? You don 't remember ? I 'm in this condition , I am afraid .. I seem to switch my personality , unexpectedly . - You tried to kill yourself . You strapped a bomb to your chest . The fail safe defense are already in motion . I am Marcos Mendez . Leader of the revolution . And you are ? - Machete . - I 've heard of you . People sings songs about you .. - We 've had this talk already . C 'mon , get up . - I didn 't hurt anyone , did I ? You had Cereza Killed . aaah .. Then , i must .. i must die . I 'd lay down my life , for the cause . And if you choose to be in my company , I fear , you will become a casualty as well . Come on . You should 've kept up with your spanish there , son . Sounds like , we maybe able to string up this Piñata after all . Let 's get on it , Clayborn . You wouldn 't happen to have a popsicle to stick up my ass would you ? A martini ... extra dirty . .. two olives .. - all we have is tequila and chango . Right . For a moment there , i forgot i was in the blackhole of sophistication , Chango it is . Although , your new selection of mexican beer is not what brings me here . - So , what does ? - You do , Carlos . But it can 't be . They say , you don 't have a face . They say , you don 't exist . - I may not exist ... But this gun , does . You don 't have to do this . You can tell whoever hired you , that i 'll give back the money ... - This isn 't about the money , Carlos . It is about my employer ... it 's about ethics . Now , if i don 't shoot you square in the face , I will be violating a ... contractual obligation and all that ... 'Don 't ' beg emotional confrontation makes me very uncomfortable . How much for the chango . - fifty cents . - I 'm gonna give you seventy five . Do you have a change for a dollar ? I don 't know where the hell we are . Excuse me ? We are a little lost .. any chance you could steer us to Leon ? I could . The trouble is .. you 've seen my face . And I have just changed . I 'm truly sorry , Ma 'm . It 's just a matter of time and place , not being in your favour . Man eater . That 's what they used to call me when i was just little girl . I didn 't know what that meant . That never stopped my daddy , coming into my bed after a night of drinking . So , one night ... I gave him what he deserved . I chewed his balls off with my teeth . The next day .. I went to school with pieces of him , still in my braces . I became what he always said I was . A Man eater ! I despise men , I can 't trust them . And that pussy clouds their minds . And now my little Cereza lays dead Because of that reason . And that 's where you come in . Just a random selection . And that you might be , You still remind me of my own Papi . Madam ? - Yes ? - We found them . Mendez and Machete . - Bring me my Double Ds . Gather all the girls . We are going to avenge .. my Cereza . You read my mind , Machete . Yes , yup yup . This is the perfect place for my last meal . Give me and my friend here , a plate of your finest Cabrito . And .. give us some bread and wine too . Thank you . See , Machete .. You are the only one , who doesn 't want me dead . What the hell are you doing back in Mexico ? Your federale brothers were very upset that you abandoned us in the heat of battle . I heard you moved to The U.S cleaning rich people 's pools huh ? Put the gun down . He is a murderer . He killed 13 Federales , in cold blood . 13 crooked Federales . Buried in Quertos pocket . How the fuck would you know that , Puto ? - I was undercover . - an agent . There 's no agents in Mexico . - Last and only , super agent . Give me one good reason , i shouldn 't shoot him like a dog that he is . If he dies , thousands in Washington would die with him . - And if he lives .. how many more would die ? And why help the U.S ? - Cos , i 'm the only one who can . - You were always a sensitive one , Machete . - Wow , hoah .. bloody hell ! It 's a Mexican Stand off . I am taking him in . - Oh , really where ? You will trade me , straight to the Cartels . Machete , this man is a dirty cop . - Shut your fucking mouth ! Shut up , Loco . - You shouldn 't have said that , Amigo . Because if you call me loco - Than i 'm afraid .. loco is what you get . - Hello again , Machete . - Say one more word ... Make sure you better make it , Machete . All you have to do is pull the fucking trigger , Come on . See Machete .. Justice and law , are not always the same thing . What the fuck is going on here ? Look at me , top scores . Forgive my excitement , but i 'm just learning to speak Spanish . Not by choice . But i can 't get the CD to change for the life of me . Fuck it , When in Rome , right ? I 'm trying to find a place call .. Villa Gerrero . Perhaps , you 've heard of it ? You haven 't heard of it ? or No se .. you don 't understand the question ? Un momento ? Allow me to use more useful illustration . I 'm really trying here . And if you say ' No Se ' one more time , i 'm gonna put a bullet in your brain . Out of sheer frustration . Now , Villa Guerrero ? Your sense of direction doesn 't inspire confidence in you . Allow me to translate . Damn ! I was just starting to get used to this face . El Doctoro ? Get the fuck out of here , I 'm performing surgery . Put him in the bed , there . Where are they ? - Still inside . Okay , i need you to check the rear . Machete ! Come out and play . What 's the hurry , Lover boy . Ugh .. disgusting . So , i 'm still alive . Good for you Machete . Good for you . Is this the crazy you , talking ? I can 't continue living my life like this . - You used to be Cartel . And then , you became a revolutionary . - Why ? - I was never Cartel . I was a Secret Agent , for the Mexican Government . My mission , was to infiltrate Los Querpos . I had to see things .. I had to do things . Had to watch people die in the worst way you can imagine . Compromising the only thing i believe in . I became one of them . I remember , calling my supervisor ; telling him that i wanted out .. I wanted my life back . But i didn 't know he was dirty . That he 'd been bought by the cartels . They took me to a killing room . With my wife and daughter there , waiting . They made me watch . First they beat them . Tortured them . Then , that 's when .. The Mad Man took over for the first time . My wife and baby girl died b 'cause i trusted our system that did not exist . I realised then , If i was to change Mexico I must do it myself . I started my own revolution against same reason motherfuckers responsible for this violence . I will die to see it through . The real tragedy of all this is that people would never know the real truth about me . How about you ? Does anybody know the real Machete ? Where is your partner ? Every guy has a partner . You couldn 't give up the life , can 't you ? Think about it . How old are you ? In your line of work ... Why have you lived so long ? Partners knew about self sacrifice .. for the greater good . Not you , though . You know what you are ? Vengeance . You are vengeance . A vengeance never dies . We will never make it to the border wall with this piece of shit . We need a stronger vehicle . An armored vehicle . I know where we can get one . Small town near the border . There 's a chop shop there . Once he crosses the border . We can move in . Come on . Come on , we gonna cross the wall or what . This is a cartel turf , you let us right to it . Shhh . Looking for a ride . Well , this lane .. you 're best off fucking rent a car . This is all custom works . I will do as he says , Grasa . Well , look at this . Marcos Mendez in the flesh . This will do . No shit . It will do . That baby is my fucking masterpiece . You could take it to a mine field with flat tyre . You aren 't gonna shoot a man in a wheel chair , would you ? - No . Hola , Motherfucker ! Hey there , loverboy . Hey there , give them hand . I 've got a special package for him . Killjoy ... give me my strap on . Ho .. ho ho ! Fuck Machete .. You 're crazier than I am ! Machete , what the hell are you doing ? - Is there other way ? - There 's no other way .. that 's why they call it a wall .. goddamn it . Take ' em away . See that frigging tag under the wall , drive us straight through it . The heat is to the other side .. Hit it . We made it . Well , sweet Isabel . I think we just hit a fucking stroke ... Beginner 's luck . Running into you again , Taco . You know , you and your compadre are going for about 10 million buck to rooster head . I never understand anything about Algebra .. That is a .. shitfire .. fuck me .. Halleluijah lot of Money . I think , we ought to take advantage of your lucrative predicament . Get ourselves to squares . No distractions , this time . Right , Clebourne ? That 's right , sir . - Alright then , Sayonara Taco . Special Agent , Mendez . How many of you are there ? - Sorry , that 's classified . And who is this ? My wanted party . You didn 't think , it would all be over once we cross the border did you ? Who do you think got me into Mexico , in the first place ? There 's a great conductor behind all this . Why re-elect President Rathcock ? He dished out 6 Million dollars on tax payers money to space technology company like Voztech industries . He build a wall to protect us from the thread of illegals . He took a stand and defended our second ammendment . with a vengeance . And to boost our national economy to an all time high ... He made marijuana legal in 48 states . My fellow Americans ... It 's been a groovy four years . There are still so much left to accomplish . For me , winning .. was only the begining . Re-elect Rathcock . A name you like , A face you can trust . Don 't worry Mr.Cortez You haven 't fail your Mission , Yet . - Where am I ? - Recuperating in my subjuest healing pool , right now .. you like it ? As you can see , our friend Marcos Cortez is still ... very much alive and ticking . Which makes him still very much , a threat . It needs to be disarmed . You don 't know what you 're dealing with . - Well , Actually I do . I invented it . Allow me to introduce myself .. My name is Luther Voz . Let me admit .. i 've been following your career for quite some time now . I am tremendous fan of your work Mr.Cortez. As an afficionado of ' The arts of War ' myself ; I just gotta say that , you 're one genuine article Genghis Khan of My caliber . Fucker , people lover . You are a warrior Mr.Cortez. A killer . A survivor .. Ilike me . Just try to relax . I mean , if i wanted you dead .. you will be fucking dead . Are you gonna disarm it or not ? I 'm leaning towards not . But that all very much depends on you , Mr.Cortez. You sold Mendez the Missile . No . I gave it to him . But then , i 've given a lot of bad things to a lot of bad people . But that does not make me one of them . Get dressed , Mr.Cortez. Allow me .. to try and convince you . I 'll turn my back . Welcome , to The Voztech . The world 's premiere space technology .. and weapons manufacturer . You know , Time Magazine once called me ... Merchant of dead . With an assembly line . But one very special day , I began to think bigger . And now .. i 've turned science fiction into science reality . And this ... this is where we conduct our training exercises . for what ? Our exodus . When NASA asked me to build them a new state of the art luxury space station ... I luxuriously told em , to fuck themselves . Why you ask ? Well , i 've already told one of my young , It 's already up there right now . Just floating the fuck around , waiting for me and my people . To inhabit it . In fact , Mr.Cortez , - Machete . Incidentally , Machete I plan on moving into my new space pad , very very soon . Im very excited . Here , have a heart . What about the heart ? Well , that 's why i 'm relocating . Climb aboard . Tanks , Missiles .. bread and butter . These are simple things , to fund my out of this world , enterprises . Why Mendez ? - Why ? Well , Bin Laden is dead . And America has always needed it 's boogy man . So , i created a new one . Yes , I supplied Senor Mendez , the fireworks . But given Mendez aptitude for the unpredictable . I left behind one of my man to keep a press of his process or lack there of . What 's your plan have to do with me ? I have high hopes for you , Mr.Machete. Higher than you can mentally ascend to . Space ship ? - Technically speaking , space shuttle . Not to mention , my legacy . It all started about six years ago . I privately funded a sub orbital launch . I went up , Myself . Yeah , i 'm something of a thrill seeeker back then . Before , what i like to call The Incident . I was up among the stars and something inexplicable happened to me . I saw the future . I saw the world ending . It unfolded right before my very eyes . That 's why , i build this . We 'll board it . Me and anyone who wants to join me . We will take the flight . And when Kingdom comes ... as it truly will . We will be safe amongst the stars . Noah had his Ark .. i got mine . You really believe that ? I believed what i 've seen . And luckily for you , sir .. I saw you up there , with me . I see glimpses of what lies ahead this is a condition i was left with after the incident . Speaking of which , I 'd take a step or two back if i were you . Ever had a Deja Vu ? Last a couple of seconds , right ? Me .. it 's been two years . You don 't believe me now , but you will . Now , if i couldn 't see into the future . Then , how could i 've made all this ? Mr.Machete , I present to you ... the arms for tomorrow . Pick your fancy . You picked the only one in the place that 's faulty . I 'm sorry , my molecular blaster doesn 't quite work right yet , keeps turning shit inside out . Perhaps , this is more your speed anyway . Retro .. yet , high tech . Demonstration ? You like it ? - Yes . It 's yours . Now , Mr.Machete .. if i could cut to the .. I 'd like to recruit you . You already have enough men . - No , not the best . By any means . How can they be ? When you 've dominantly played em yourself . Demonstration . Good luck . Ha .. ha , Encore . Encore . or three . Genetically engineered super soldiers , you see . Cloned . Have at ' em . Just as I predicted ! No match .. For the likes of you . I 've created my clones . Because where I am going , I 'm going to need my army . And that poor dead bastard you 've met in Mexico . Zaror ? He was my prototype . But since you 've fucked him up like a special at science fair project . I 'm left to regret my choice . You still haven 't told me , Why i am here . I need a stronger speciment from which to draw on new batch of clone . So , i was hoping that you , would be doing me that honour . Sir ? There is only one Machete . But what if they were more ? What if there was an army with enhanced Machetes ? Machete . Machete , everywhere Machete . You and I , together ? Will be a force to be recon with . I 'm sorry . I may have over reacted . But then , numbnuts was about to spill a bottle of 1787 Chateau LeFrig . No more games . Disarm him . - Join me . Surely , by now .. that i know how all this turns out . Then , you know i 'm taking this . Oh , and where will you go ? You know , i am the only one that can disarm it . I 'll find someone else . Oh , good luck with that . But i think , there 's one more little thing that you should know . Mendez wasn 't my only Boogey man . North Korea , Russia .. I have a Mendez everywhere . And in a matter of an hour , they 're gonna launch on one another . Throwing the world into , gargantual , unrecoverable anarchy . The world is fucked . - Why ? This world must end , in order for a more perfect one to emerge . You like it or not , Mr.Machete. You are coming with me . Damn , you 're good . Get that bastard . Try not to get too many of yourselves killed in the process . My molecule blaster just doesn 't work right yet . Keeps turning shit inside out . What took you so long ? - You 're lucky , i came at all . Oh , we 'll meet again Mr.Machete. I have seen it . We 've been tracking you since the bounty hit the air-wave . Quite a shit storm you 've stirred up down south . I thought i 'd tap in . Can 't let you have all the fun . Hey , I 'm sorry about Sartana . We all are . She was one of the good ones . As you can see , the network has gone full scale . New and improved . All 500,000 extractions . and counting . When they put up the wall . We had to up our game . Find funding ... Now , our reach extends all the way to Santi tower . The rules are the same . You get in , you gotta earn . The monitor remembers to make sure they 're doing their part . If they are not .. I will deport their asses myself . Missing .. all of them ? MIA - every last one of ' em . One minute they are tearing ass for the border . The next .. they vanished . Disappeared , without a trace . It 's like aliens .. abducted by god damn aliens . You gotta check this out . This is the surveilance footage we got . We think , the same douchebag that took you . Took them . Seems llike he 's building some sort of secret weapon . Possibly , needing the mexicans labours to finish it . It 's in space . He wants to get there , before the missiles take off . What missiles ? What the fuck are you talking about ? The launch trigger is wired to a biological clock . We need to find someone to disarm them . You got anybody in the network ? - Yeah . But you don 't like him . Osiris ! Come on Machete .. He 's with us . - Not with me . - He 's our only bomb guy . Wanna choke him out , go ahead . What 's he doing here ? - He came to me about six months ago . Said , he 's changed his tune . Cabron ain 't got no tune . I know that you 'd prefer to see me , with all sorts of dead . But God has already cursed me for what i did to Padre . That 's why i am here . To finish your brother 's work . My only redemption is in righting that wrong . Please , give me mercy . I swear ... I will make it upto you . - or die , trying . - i 'll have it no other way . - This is your bomb guy ? - You could try the yellow pages . You better be at somewhere with a shit reception b 'cos i 've been trying to reach you all damn day . Where is Mendez ? - Dead . But his heart still beats . - You 're joking , right ? Machete , don 't joke . Humour me , who 's got the heart ? - Voz . He is bad news . Been using Mendez to do all of his dirty works . - Machete , I 'm gonna stop you right there , okay ? Luther Voz may have his hand in a lot of pockets . But he 's harmless . He sponsors my damn pageant for Christ 's sake . You need to alert the president . Just calm down . Tell me your location ... and we 'll talk about this in person . Better be somewhere else . Have it your way . I 'm gonna text you a rendevous point after my swimsuit competition . Who 's the bitch ? Handler . You fucked her ? Yeah , you did . You got a problem ? - Yeah , i got a problem . When you smell like pussy ... It makes you a pussy whip . When you are pussy whipped , your judgement is cloudy . It 's just a job . Is that her ? I thought Machete don 't text ? Machete loves everybody . Where are you going ? - With you . Takes a bitch , to make a bitch . And i smell fish taco . Tito .. Osiris ? Taco time . What 'cha know ? .. I won . - Congratulations . It 's exciting right ? You are looking at the new miss Texas . Who are they ? Listen , Careno .. I would love to stay and chit chat with you . But not when there 's a live missile inside state lines . Would you pretty please , get into the car and debrief me on your mission . How did you know ? - Know what ? The missile .. that it was here ? Look at you ... smart for an average mexican . - You work for Voz ? - I promised to turn you over to Voz and Voz promised me the crown . But i can win . Oh , Papi i 'm sorry . You and I really could have something . But i just love killing a good romance . Make it count . I knew i smelled a bitch in there , tonight . Payback is the only bitch that you need to worry about . This dress cost more than your fucking life ! I always dress to the nine . I dress to kill . How many man do we got ? This is The President . Mr.President , this is Miss San Antonio . Machete , never shown up to therendezvous . I just hope that he is still alive . Fuck it . Who am I kidding ? I really must hand it to you , Mi Amigo . You are a difficult man to catch up with . You have no idea , what i went through to get here . Hours i spend stranded on the desert highway . Till this holy rolly break came along . Lady , please help me . You and i aren 't drug pushing compadres . You 'd just derail my pursuit .. so , frankly .. i 'm leaning on the other direction entirely . Give me mercy . There 's about three things i 'd rather give you . And they are all on the chamber of this gun . Straight up or with some flare . Straight up or flare . Whatever is the more interesting way to die . Weirdo . You know , i rather enjoy my new disguise . I must apologize for making you dig your own grave . But i 'm not one for hard labour . You on the other hand .. being mexican and all You must be used to it . Holy fucking ... People , did you see a mexican guy ? Drop it . Before i put this thing in your face .. You have it all wrong . This is all a big mistake . - The only mistake you made was dancing across the border muchacho . You don 't understand . I am no mexican . Don 't move your hands , amigo . Sir , really . Listen to my voice . Do i sound mexican ? I am from Ontario for fuck 's sake . Canadian and Mexican ... Double whammy . Let 's smoke this fool . Doc Felix needs to see him right away . - Machete . You are back . Sorry about the smell . Did you know an average person pass a gas 14 times a day ? It 's true . Our target .. Luther Voz . The same proper fuck who 's been jacking our members . As we speak , he 's got a missile pointed right up our ass . And since it looks like no one else is gonna stop him ; It 's on us . Machete 's mission with Voz has nothing to do with us . We are the network . Our Mission is Mexico . Our mission has changed . He is right . I am going alone . - You 're not going anywhere , without me Cabron . No time to argue . Fuck that . Let me explain something .. Miherte . This isn 't about Mexico , no more . It 's about the world . No world ... no Mexico . Count me in . Me too ... me too . - Ditto . VIVA MACHETE ! Looks like it 's settled , Machete . When do we hit him ? - Tonight . - Network one in position . - network two in position . Ladies and Gentleman , your host ... Mr.Voz. My fellow travellers , my friends ... I proudly present .. The Millenium One . Ready to launch right on schedule . Now , before long ... We 'll be transported to heavens on a maiden voyage of a titanic proportions ! And once , the world is purged . We 'll return to bring about .. A new world .. TOGETHER ! In a moment , the boarding process will begin . But first , my friends ... prepare for infinity . Reveal your new selves to me . Why don 't you tell them the truth ? Tell them , you orchestrated all this . The missiles , the heart ... Would someone please .. help the help . He seems to be lost . Tell them , if the world ends . You are the one who ended it . How can this be ? This isn 't supppose to be happening . I never saw this . Machete happened . Look , this is no time for second thoughts . The end is near , I assure you . For you . Let 's do this . Well , ladies and gents .. I had hope to have an unhibited evening . But .. now it seems .. Guard ! What in the fuck is that ? I 'm more of a cherry bomb , matchstick kinda guy you know . Semtex .. TMT . 50 / 50 shot on a good day . But this .. Never mind .. we are alive . It 's a shame . I have to kill you now Mr.Machete. You gotta go . Go in style now . Well now .. what can i say . I suppose , we both like getting our hands a little dirty . You can 't beat me , you know ? I know your every move . Even before you do . Nobody knows Machete . That 's true . Ever since , i 've met you .. the future has been more unclear . And that , that puzzles me . I assure you i 'm every bit as merciless as what you are .. Demonstration How poetic , Now you really are the blind , leading the blind . Alright folks , let 's keep it moving . Form a single file line , one after another . Thank you . Keep your hands in the strap and hold on tight . Really ? You 're gonna make me kill a blind chick ? The Press could her my crown for that . That 's alright , they will just give it to the next bimbo , who spreads like virus . Alright , darling . You wanna tango ... let 's tango . Mano-a-mano Motherfucker . Watch it now , pussycat . That 's not a very lady like kinda thing to say . I don 't do lady like . So , what is it ?

Pissing on your study day , you 're fucked with the wrong mexican . Indeed i have . However , in 20 second .. none of them would matter . But you .. you 're still in pickle . Anyway , you slice it . I can 't see , but i can still kick your ass . That 's why i 'm taking you with me . This is your captain speaking . I apologize in advance for the discomfort you may experience during our travel . But we are unforeseeably overbooked . So , please hang on . And try to enjoy the flight . See you in space , Mr.Machete. Machete , i got your message . We were able to stop the other missiles . Where is that son of a bitch , Voz ? Are you telling me that ... is out there flipping with weapons and shit ? I got a wild idea . Just hear me out . I can put you , in a space A Rocket . Top of the line . You go , up in the space ... I 'll do it . Your country thanks you . Good luck , Machete . Get the Bastard .

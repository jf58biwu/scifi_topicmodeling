 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives And it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall . Her son - a genetically engineered boy genius . A schoolgirl investigator across the road . And a whole universe of adventure - right here on the doorstep . SHE SCREAMS Aah ! Ready ? Always . My name is Miss Myers . You 're going to help me find my child . She wasn 't left on my doorstep by accident . Someone needs me to protect her . Before they come for her . This was a bloke . Fell out of the sky . His skin was all metal ! Bannerman Road . Get in if you want the child to live ! She 's no child . She 's a weapon . Sky 's energy - it 's flooding out of her ! The doom of the Metalkind has come . What just happened ? I think Sky just grew up . With no birthdays ? That 's just rubbish ! I am too late . Face your destruction , Metalkind ! The child is your doom ! What 's happening to me ? ! Destroy him ! Argh ! Again , my child ! No ! What am I ? Oh , Sky , don 't be frightened . You are the hammer to crush Metalkind ! You are the weapon and salvation of our species . Destroy your enemy ! No , Sky . You don 't have to destroy anything . You don 't have any enemies ! Just be calm . Trust me . It 's all right . Sarah Jane ? Everything 's going to be all right . I promise . Stop your meddling ! Come with me . Return home and fulfil your purpose . I don 't think she wants to go with you . I am the child 's mother ! Introducing Miss Myers . She spells it the alien way . My name is Sarah Jane Smith , and I don 't think you 're a fit parent . She is a weapon ! Grown in a laboratory to destroy the enemies of my species . I grew her ! What does she mean ? Don 't listen to her , Sky . We can 't help how we come into this universe . But we have a say in what we become . This is an innocent child , not a weapon . I will protect her from the Metalkind and from you ! Run ! Shall I stop them ? I have a better idea . I have to get you as far away from that woman as I can . Is she really my mother ? All I know is somebody brought you to me to protect you . That 's what I 'll do . Have you come to finish the job , Fleshkind ? Perhaps your weapon isn 't as powerful as you thought . The weapon will do its job . And you 're going to help me . Wire him up ! This is where you live , I remember . You remember when you were a baby ? It was only about half an hour ago . Why do you call a man who wears paper trousers Russell ? I beg your pardon , hmm ? It was a joke . It was meant to be funny , to make her laugh . Boy , does this feel familiar . You were telling her jokes ? It was to stop her crying . You know what she does when she laughs . I like Sid the Sleeve . You had to be there . It 's like ... Everything 's so green . Well , this is England . It rains most of the time . Do you remember being brought here and by who ? You are the first thing I remember . Oh , I see . Well , now you 're grown up , can you control your powers ? I think so . You 've got to promise that you will , cos I need you to meet a friend . Welcome to the Bat Cave . There 's a cave on top of the house ? It 's not a cave . It 's an attic . Clyde was joking again . He does that . Sort of . Mr Smith , I need you . What 's going on ? It 's all right . Sky won 't hurt you . Wow ! Is the child under control ? It 's all right . I promise . What are you ? I am a Xylok . A crystalline life form with highly sensitive cybernetic interfaces . Please remain distant . Can we still be friends ? If my circuits remain intact . Sky has undergone a metamorphosis . I need you to ensure she 's unharmed . Don 't worry . It won 't hurt . Scanning . It tickles ! Please , try not to laugh . Don 't fuss . Analyse the scan . Biologically , Sky appears to be a healthy twelve-year-old child . Twelve ? Is that a good age ? Well , until the spots start . Rani , take Sky . Look through Luke 's things . See if you can find her something to wear . Sure . Come on , Sky . Mr Smith , how did she transform into a teenager ? Sky 's DNA was programmed for this level of maturity to maximize her effectiveness . As a weapon ? As a bomb . Full activation would not only destroy Miss Myers ' enemies across the universe , but also kill Sky . Is Sarah Jane Luke 's mother ? Yeah . She adopted him . Luke was ... made by aliens that wanted to take over Earth . I like Earth . It 's beautiful , noisy , smelly . RANI LAUGHS Yeah ! It 's all that . This must be so weird for you . Like seeing the world for the first time . Everyone else , they just sort of grow up with it . It 's exciting ! Try these . They 're not exactly fashion but you 'll be all right . What 's fashion ? Clothes . Like wearing nice clothes , made for a girl . What 's a girl ? RANI SIGHS And Clyde thought he had it tough with Luke . OK . Let 's log on to Ranipedia ! Why create a child that 's a bomb ? What sort of sick species is Myers ? ! A binary planetary system exists at the eye of the Tornado Nebula . One has carbon-based life forms like those on Earth . The other evolved as boron-based life . And for those of us watching the netball team during chemistry ? Boron is a metalloid element . On one planet , people evolved like us - blood , bones , flesh . On the other - metal . Amazing ! This Fleshkind planet . That 's where Sky 's from ? Yes . Metalkind and Fleshkind have been at war for centuries . I believe Sky was created as a doomsday weapon . To destroy Metalkind . I 've never known anything as hideous as using a child as a bomb ! What 's a bomb ? Oh , Sky . Miss Myers said I was a weapon . That 's bad , isn 't it ? Am I bad ? No . No way . Miss Myers , she 's the bad one . Not you . What am I , then ? The thing inside you . Miss Myers created you like that to kill her enemies , Metalkind . Kill ? What 's kill ? You take away life . It dies . It no longer exists . And that 's wrong . It 's always wrong ! But if that 's what I was made to do , that makes me bad . No , because it 's not your fault . Mr Smith , there must be a way to reverse what 's been done to Sky . No . At a molecular level , Sky is a weapon programmed to destruct on contact with energies of massed Metalkind . I 'm sorry , this cannot be undone . OK , if she 's a bomb , can 't we just defuse her ? Oh , Clyde ! That 's ... brilliant ! Turn off the genetic trigger . Stop her detonating . Is that possible ? Genetically she 'd be a weapon but disarmed . Only Sky 's creator can do that . Then let 's go ask her ! Sky , it 's not going to be as easy as that . Going back to the power station 's dangerous . What 's dangerous ? You could die . Mr Smith said I could die , anyway . I don 't want to be a bomb . Sarah Jane , will you help me ? I can 't help thinking this is a bad idea . I know . I don 't want that woman anywhere near Sky , but she 's the only one that can deprogram her DNA . She has to come with us ! Before that , a small point - Myers may have put the techies into a trance but the guard looks lively . I 'm not risking the gates again . Old reporter 's superstition - never break in the same way twice . I can do this . ELECTRICITY CRACKLES ALARM ZAP ! Now , I need you to stay here with Clyde and Rani . What for ? Yeah , ditto ! I need to make sure that Sky is safe until I 'm ready . Oh , great , so we get baby-sitting duty ? Who are you calling a baby ? We 're doing this by my rules . Until I convince Miss Myers of another way to end this war - a peaceful way - you 're in danger . I need you to stay with Clyde and Rani . Do you promise me ? I suppose . Right . Oh ! Good ! Now ... take me to your leader . She might need our help . She told us to stay here . Do you always do what Sarah Jane tells you to ? This is a nuclear power station , which makes going in with you Like doing a Houses of Parliament tour with Guy Fawkes . What are you talking about ? He means it 's not safe . Anyway , you promised . I don 't really understand promises . Hey , wait ! That kid 'll get us into trouble ! SINISTER MUSIC Miss Smith . Welcome back . Complete your work . I trust you 're taking good care of my child ? Yes . You won 't be getting your hands on her again ! Don 't judge me . Do you think I like what this war has forced me to do ? To become ? I 'm asking you , deactivate what you 've done to Sky . Deactivate ? She is our saviour . Her touch carries the power and the fury of an exploding sun . Once fully unleashed it will destroy every Metalkind in existence . Sky 'll be destroyed with them ! A sacrifice for the preservation of Fleshkind . That 's not a sacrifice . That 's slaughter ! Listen to me , please . There are other ways to end a war . You just have to want peace more than death . You know nothing . For centuries the Metalkind have savaged my people . They swore to destroy all flesh . What chance does flesh have against jaws and blades of iron and steel ? But perhaps you will learn ! What is this ? The child damaged the Metalkind just enough for me to make use of it . As a homing device . A homing device ? For what ? It 's being wired into the nuclear core . At the flick of a switch it will summon Metalkind and they will swarm here in hordes . You 're bringing your war to Earth ? ! Once your Fleshkin experience Metalkind savagery , you will realise that the child will save us all ! Caleb , make the final connection . Metalkind , stop this ! Earth has done nothing to hurt your people ! Fleshkind tore the ore from our planet 's womb to make dumb slaves . They stole our children . We have sworn vengeance on all Fleshkind - on any world ! I 've scrambled its brain . He thinks he 's calling all Metalkind to a glorious battle against Flesh . Not to its destruction . You 're wasting your time . I will never give you Sky ! It doesn 't matter . The child is primed to activate on exposure to the massed energy of the Metalkind . When they come , they will be destroyed . She cannot stop it . And neither can you ! ELECTRONIC PULSING Come to me , Metalkindred ! Join me and rend flesh ! What is it ? The Metalkind . I can feel them . They 're coming ! PULSING CONTINUES Bringing the Metalkind to Earth - you 're worse than them ! You 're bringing war to an innocent planet ! This is survival . But there 's still time before I open the portal . Bring me the child and I will take her home to face our enemy . Your planet will never know the butchery of the Metalkind ! What would you put first , Miss Smith ? One child or your entire world ? Wait and see ! Whatever you choose , Sarah Jane Smith , Sky will fulfil her destiny ! Sky ! I thought I told you to keep her away ! She says the Metalkind are coming . I 've got to stop them ! No ! Wars are ended by talking , not killing . But Earth won 't stand a chance ! You 've been kind to me and tried to keep me safe . But I was created for this . Sky , listen to me . This is wrong . Killing is always wrong . If you confront the Metalkind you will die . If I don 't , you will . Maybe this is why I was brought here . To save Earth . No , Sky ! Sky ! This way ! No . I 'll go after Sky . Shut down the reactor to stop the Metalkind coming through ! Shut down a nuclear reactor , how are we suppose to do that ? We find a way ! Any way ! ELECTRONIC PULSING CLYDE PANTS OK , OK , control room , control room ... ? Control room , come on ! Sky ! Stop it ! You mustn 't ! Stay back , Sarah Jane ! You are too late , Sarah Jane Smith . ELECTRIC CRACKLING The portal has opened . The Metalkind come , to their death ! I have to save you , Sarah Jane . I have to save Earth . LOUD BLEEPING Clyde . What 's all this about ? It 's like a big arcade game . This is what controls the nuclear fuel rods . It 's James Bond - pull out the rods , close the reactor , save the world . More like James Bond meets Mario . Ace , cos I 'm brill at Mario . If we don 't do this right , Clyde , we don 't just go back to the last level . BLEEPING CONTINUES But it 's not coming out ! It 's not working ! Sky , don 't let them use you ! It 's what I am , Sarah Jane . You 're not a weapon . Not if you don 't want to be ! You are a child . A beautiful , innocent child . Remember what I told you , it 's wrong to kill ! What are we doing wrong ? What ? We must remove them in order . Two at a time . What order ? It 's a spectrum - Richard of York gave battle in vain . What ? Red , orange , yellow , green , blue , indigo , violet ! Well , come on ! We haven 't got much time ! PULSING AND CRACKLING It 's too late . They 're coming ... they 're here ! The end is nigh ! Almost ! No , Sky ! Last one ! PULSING AND CRACKLING BUILDS SKY SCREAMS What did you do to the TV ? ! That does it . Tomorrow we get this house rewired ! 'Emergency lighting activated . ' What have you done ? ! We did it ! We shut down the core ! What happened ? ! All that energy had to go somewhere . Sky was like a lightning rod ! She absorbed it all . Is she going to be all right ? Wow ! Are you all right ? I feel . I feel ... different . You are different . I can feel it , too . That energy backlash , it 's destroyed your genetic programming . You mean , I 'm not a weapon ? Not even a peashooter . I have lost my daughter . You saved me ! And ... I 'm not a bomb any more ! Thank you ! I saved some energy just for you , Fleshkind ! MISS MYERS SCREAMS Uh-oh ! I 'm too tired to think of clever answers for awkward questions . Come on . Let 's go home . So , all that light-bulb popping and stuff , that 's all finished ? I think so . Mr Smith will be relieved ! And , thank you . I can always rely on you two to throw the switch when it matters . Sarah ! Mum ! I was telling Haresh all about you fostering beautiful baby Sky . Hello ! That 's me . Hello ! I thought you said she was a baby ? She was . I grew up . Well , that 's what babies do . But not just in one day . Obviously ! Obviously ! That would be , well ... you know , alien . Yes , there was a mix-up . Social services brought me the wrong child . Would you believe it ? They brought me a baby called Sky when it should 've been a teenager ! With the same name . Sky . Sky Smith . Sky Smith ? Amazing . Yes , she is . Really amazing . Now , if you 'll excuse us . SKY GIGGLES Did you just see that ? Yeah , I reckon Sparky hasn 't totally lost her spark . I just want Mr Smith to make sure there are no ill-effects from that energy blast . PARROT SQUAWKS What ? Really , Miss Smith , how can you possibly see through this ? How did you get in here ? I 'm afraid the Captain considers that privileged information . Oh , yes , I forgot . You 're the one in charge , aren 't you ? The bird ? Things are seldom quite what they seem , young lady . And my , haven 't you grown ? What , it was ... you ? You brought Sky here ! And might I say , what a perfect name for such a perfect child , young Sky . I 'd still like to know who you are . Both of you . Consider us servants of the universe . Which means what , exactly ? Sometimes , things can 't be left to chance . Sometimes , a breeze must blow from east to west , not north to south . Sometimes , a sky should be blue , not laden with cloud . And sometimes , a child must find her way home . Which is my task , Miss Smith . To put things ... in the right place . And of all the homes in all the universe , I could find none safer for this child than yours . But who are you ? All in good time . Have you come for me ? Well , that depends on you . Can I stay here with you ? That 's what I want . Oh , Sky , it 's only been a day and I feel like I 've known you since you were a baby ! Yes , this is your home for as long as you want it to be . Well , that 's that then . Jolly good . Until the next time . Oh , no , wait ! Who was he , then ? I haven 't the faintest idea . but I dare say we 'll find out ... all in good time . Oh , you must be starving ! How does pizza sound ? What 's pizza ? SHE LAUGHS Come on . 'But the most wonderful thing about the universe 'is that there 's always something more amazing to come . ' Isn 't it pretty ? Creepy , more like . Ow ! Do you know anything about curses ? Get out , now ! What 's going on ? I don 't get it . Get out ! You get away from me ! Leave my daughter ! We 're mates . I hate you ! This is not happening . That 's what I 'm going to do to you ! Keep your distance from him ! Police , I want to make a complaint . I don 't ever want to hear his name again . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail subtitling @ bbc.co. uk

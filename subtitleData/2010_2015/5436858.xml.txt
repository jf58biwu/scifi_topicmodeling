 Have you seen Barry ? He 's washing his laundry . Thanks Wanda . And by laundry , I mean penis . ( Giggling ) Hey Barry . Eliza ? ! You said you would save yourself for marriage ! But baby , everybody knows blowjobs don 't count . Women . With all this teen angst the Book of Pure Evil is bound to show up . Can 't we just get away from the book and prophecy for one night ? I 'm gonna get so wasted . You 're gonna have to take care of me . I never really understood the whole intoxication thing . My brain 's my best friend . Why would I want to be removed from it ? Trust me . The book will show up . This is gonna be the best party ever . What the hell is going on ? Hi Aaron . Hannah ? What are you doing in my house ? And who are all these people ? We 're here for the house party . House party ? When my mom gets back from her vacation she is gonna kill me . Your mom 's right over there . Shh ! Holy shit ! What am I gonna do ? ( Glass breaking ) Gotta save my granny 's ashes ! What a good idea , a cup that makes beer thicker . I feel really bad for Aaron . I know . This is Nikki . She 's my girlfriend , I 'm her boyfriend . It 's hot and heavy . Hello . I 'm Jenny . Oh you 're the chick Todd dumped for me . What ? Is that what he told you ? No . So what school do you go to Nikki ? I don 't . She 's a high school dropout . Obviously . Cool ! Where 's the can ? I gotta take a shit . Well , at least she 's classy . I know ! Isn 't she great ? Let 's talk book business before Nikki gets back . We don 't have to hide anything from her , she 's my girlfriend . She 's not in the gang , Todd . Not yet . I was thinking Nikki should be in the gang . No . She 's sexy- - No . Cute , she really likes denim . Well it sounds like you two have a really deep connection . Whatever . Hey Curtis , let 's go get the girls some beer . No thank you . I was talking about Nikki . She loves beer . Maybe a bit too much . Barry . Ahhh ! You stole my heart ! I just wanted to break your heart the way you broke mine . ( Screaming ) Thanks babe . Barry you asshole , I need that to live ! I have infiltrated the house party , father . Here , I will find the new young blood my society needs . Our society atticus . Ya , well , now that the minions are dead ... It 's my society . Atticus , you fool ! You are the school guidance counselor . I 'm not the guidance counselor , father . I 'm in disguise . I 'm Scooter ! A devil-may-care kid from the wrong side of the tracks . Atticus , I fear for your sanity . Why is that , father ? You 're talking to an inanimate head ! Ya , well , I could argue that you 're talking to me . Scooter 's ready to party ! Nikki 's hot , right ? Like hotter than Jenny ? She looks like she knows a lot about sex . Like she 's done it a lot . With a lot of different guys . Ya , but that just means she 's , like , experienced . Oh yeah . So have you guys gotten anywhere yet ? No man . I 'm hoping we have sex tonight because my balls cannot get any bluer . Really blue ? They 're still ball color , they just really hurt . So , you and Hannah done any sexy stuff yet ? She kissed me on my birthday . Hey ! Shit ! These guys ... Aren 't they a little old to be at a high school party ? Aren 't you a little lame to be at a high school party ? Swamp is knee deep in booze and cooze . Not that you guys are getting any . Only losers don 't get laid at a high school house party . ( Laughing ) Go smoke a doob . And then get laid . And then smoke another doob . Losers . Wooooo ! I like a hard-drinking man . Watch this Wanda . ( Coughing ) Lenny the lightweight ! Oh ! So what else can you do with that mouth of yours ? I can suck my own dick . ( Cheers ) I hate those guys , but they are right . We have to get laid tonight . I thought you were saving yourself for Jenny . Jenny had her chance . Besides , Nikki totally wants me . And you heard those guys , only losers don 't get laid at high school house parties . Hey , let 's swear a pact , that tonight we both lose our virginities . But Todd , I have a girlfriend . I meant with your girlfriend and then we could both be men . I wanna be a man . Tonight , we will become men ! And drunk ! You sure you don 't want to talk about it ? What , I 'm having a great time . This party is awesome . Hey . I guess I 'll just treat this as an anthropological experiment . Where 's Nikki ? Let 's go find somewhere more private . Ya , wicked . Do you want to come to the basement with me ? Yeah go ahead , it 's not like we have anything better to do . Ok . I was being sarcastic , of course we have something better to do ! Ok guys , yep . I 'll just find the book on my own , don 't need help from you . You guys just go enjoy exploring each other 's bodies . Ahh ! ( Cheers ) Yay ... Fuck . ( Smooching ) Scram ! So , I guess , uh , we 're all alone , huh . Just the two of us . This is probably a good opportunity for us to make out and stuff . Yeah , let 's make out . If by make out you mean put your bone in my O-zone . What are we doing down here , Curtis ? I just thought we should spend some alone time together . This is nice . Yeah , this is sweet . What 's the hold up ? Maybe we should talk a bit first ? You know , get to know each other-- - you 're a horny teenaged dude and I 'm a smokin ' hot high school dropout , one plus one equals fun .

 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives ! It 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extra-terrestrial super computer in the wall . Her son , a genetically-engineered boy genius . A schoolgirl investigator across the road . And a whole universe of adventure , right here on the doorstep . Ready ? Always . Meteor redirected to these co-ordinates . Strong possibility of germ pathogens . We 've got to neutralise it ! Rani , bio-coolant ! Clyde , thermo-clamps ! Go , go , go ! If it splits opens , the germs will escape ! We 've got to be quick ! Just in time . Rani ? On it ! Agh ! Whoa ! What was that ? It 's reading all clear ? ! I didn 't do anything ! BEEPING There 's something there ! What are you doing here ? Saving the world . All in a day 's work . Goodbye ! No , wait ! Who are you ? ! She 's exactly like you ! She 's bad news , whoever she is . Last thing we need is amateurs ! She looked pretty professional to me . She must 've detected the meteor , so she has alien tech . Plus she knew what she was doing . Well , I 'll get Mr Smith on the case . We 'll find her . Wait , wait , wait . What did I just see ? We 've found her . What ? There was a big furniture van out there the other day . Wonder Woman 's moved in down the road ? ! Agh , you left the hand brake off ! Must be getting old . So what now ? Well ... we find out exactly what 's going on here . We need to talk . You followed me ? ! We only live over there ! Like I care , get lost ! Not ... good enough ! Ah ! Get out of my house ! I 've been doorstepping since I was 19 . The days at the South Croydon Echo never left her . A journalist ? I might have known . Get out or I 'll call the police . You don 't really want to do that . Not with alien technology lying about the place . You have no idea what you 're getting into here ! Or you wouldn 't be bringing kids with you . Wherever I go , they go . You get one minute . What 's your name ? What 's yours ? Ruby White . Put that down ! Who d 'you think you are ? You used a bio-coolant spray on a meteor you couldn 't have known had fallen to Earth . To destroy germs you couldn 't have known it contained . Would you like to explain ? All of which equally applies to you . Don 't think I haven 't met amateurs before . Why this house ? Why move here ? This area - they call it the Ealing Triangle . Trueman , the astrologer , happened here . The Bubbleshock factory , ten minutes away . WATCH BEEPS Reports of rhinos in police cars . Alien plant life , shall I go on ? How very peculiar . Your little cub reporters not taking notes ? My name 's Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm not an amateur . I don 't think you are either . I don 't care what you think . Your minute 's up . Get out . Now ! 'Ruby Ann White . First class degree in biophysics from Oxford , 'attached to the Auckland Institute , recently returned from New Zealand . ' OK , save the rest for later . You got to admit , she sounds kosher . Yeah , just like us , except ruder . Sarah Jane ? Hmm ? Oh , sorry . What were we talking about ? Er ... Ruby White ? Oh , sorry . I was miles away . So what do we do about her ? What she wants . We stay away . Yeah , but we keep our eyes open . Right , you two , home , it 's been a long day . You OK , Sarah Jane ? Fine . Bye ! No , this one . Oh ! Huh ? ! Did you see that face , then ? ! So cheeky . - Ooh ! Hello , new neighbour ! - Hello . Hello , afternoon . Ooh , charming . Frosty the Snow-woman . Yeah , maybe she 's got her reasons . DAD : Somebody knows something . Went round there the other day . Oh ? Just to say hello . Hello , Clyde . Secret new friend , why wasn 't I invited ? She 's not the friendly type . .. Hello , sir . You know , I 'm still not feeling the yellow . - It was Gita 's idea ! - It 's like summer all year round . Number 46 , is she ? I 've always wanted to look in there , but she was a right ratbag , that old Mrs Kuthrapali . Gita ! The woman 's only been dead a month ! Afternoon , Sarah . Oh , hi ! Can 't stop . Have to put Luke 's tea on . Is Luke back ? Rani didn 't say . What ? No , no , he 's not back ... Sorry , excuse me . Oh , shall I go over ? No , Mum , leave her alone . Clyde , we need to pick up that stuff . Bye . Come on , Haresh . Look , I know she 's been acting a bit weird , but that was off the scale ! And now she 's left the door open ! You know what , she needs a holiday . You 're right , let 's tell her . No wait ! You hang back five minutes , I 'll do it . Mum , is something wrong ? No , nothing , just wanted a chat . Missing you . Already ? It 's only been a couple of hours since you called . Well , Mum 's prerogative . How 's ... Oh , whatshisname , metal dog ? You mean K9 ? Yeah , he 's good . Mum , are you sure you 're all right ? Yes , I 'm absolutely fine ! Hey , Rani ! Hi , Luke . Don 't worry , I 'm keeping your mum out of trouble . Oh , tough job . Listen , I said I 'd meet Sanjay back at the Union , gotta go . See you later , bye . Love you . Right , what can I do you for ? You are not all right , Sarah Jane . Oh , yeah , I 've been waiting for this , Rani . I forget something , I make a silly mistake , and you blow it into this big disaster ... No , I 'm not even going to try . Hey , you 're missing Luke ? Yes , of course , but it 's not just that . It 's like ... I can 't concentrate . When was the last time you took a holiday , a proper holiday ? I love my work , I don 't need one . When was the last time ? Look , I can 't put a sign on the dark side of the moon , " Oh , don 't invade this week , cos Old Smith , she 's on her hols . " Go and see Luke just for a few days . He only lives an hour down the road . 'RED ALERT ! RED ALERT ! ' Mr Smith , report ! ' Spacecraft approaching the solar system ! ' Get it on the screen ! 'Scanning . No visual contact . 'Suggest intruders are using shields . ' Bring up their data traces , quick ! A fleet ! Moving in to attack ! 'Inference . Invasion of earth . ' Identify ! Whoa ! The Dark Horde ! Oh , bad news ... They 've never come this near to Earth . 'Their ships are undetectable by human technol ... 'ALERT - our scan beam is being traced ! ' Well , switch it off ! 'Too late , they have located us . Dark Horde strategy 'will be to neutralise any technology considered a threat . ' I know them and what they did on the Kravasta colonies ... They 'll be coming straight for us ! 'A teleport beam is locking down on the attic . 'I can divert it , but not reverse it . ' Bring them down in the nearest uninhabited area ! ' Complying . ' And contact UNIT ! 'All transmissions are now blocked ! ' What , we 're on our own ? ! Oh , well , life was getting boring anyway . Rani , take that ! Clyde ... Your hour has come ! What are you doing ? Our job is to protect this planet ! By any means ! Are you serious ? ! More than I 've ever been . You 're going to let him fire that ? ! Sarah Jane , this is not like you ! Oh , stop talking and MOVE ! How many do you think there are ? Should we split up ? No ! Stay close . They 're down , three of them , advance party . They 'll knock us out , then fortify . Whoa ! Down , down ! They 're coming ! They won 't kill us till they 've scanned us . First indigenous specimens . They 're scare tactics . The scare tactics are working ! We need them close . They 're ruthlessly logical . This Scanblind will overload their sensors . They 'll think we 're tougher , they withdraw - simple ! Use it ! Close enough ! Need to activate it . Clyde , the sonic ! I don 't have it ! I told you to bring it ! You said bring this ! What good 's that ? ! It 's not even charged ! What 's Plan B ? There is no plan B ! Oh , I 've got us killed . Scan complete . Inferiors . Eliminate ! I 'm so sorry . Oh , Luke . Dark Horde Warriors ! You got it wrong , boys ! Scan over here ... Wait till you see what I 've got for you ! Clyde ! Rani ! Trust me ! Clyde , left ! Rani , right ! Catch ! When I shout , press the buttons ! Trust me ! Inferiors . Eliminate ! Now ! Is everyone all right ? What did you just do ? You mean , what did we do ? 'Dark Horde fleet retreating . ' What 's that ? 'I 'm an artificial intelligence . Hello . ' Hello . Somebody explain . ' With your help , I reflected back to the Horde 'an image of a slightly stronger version of themselves . 'Their logical reaction was to flee . ' Cool ! Should call him Mr White ! Ruby , you saved our lives , you saved the Earth ! You are amazing ! No , I 've been doing my research . If anyone 's amazing , it 's you , Sarah Jane . Rani Chandra , Clyde Langer , thank you both . I don 't think we were properly introduced last time , which is my fault , jumping to conclusions . You 're no amateurs . If that handshake is still on offer , Sarah Jane ? Welcome to the attic ! Wow , this is incredible ! 'And rather unexpected . ' Ruby White , say hello to Mr Smith ! She 's a friend . Mr Smith , wow , hello ! Makes my revelation less impressive . Nah , he 's good - pocket-sized ! Mr White , I like that - reminds me of my dad . Where did you get him ? New Zealand , dredged him out of a swamp . I couldn 't turn him in . They 'd use him as a weapon of war . Mr Smith , meet Mr White ! 'Hello , Mr Smith . ' 'You 're certainly the most agreeable artificial intelligence I 've met 'since I 've been on this planet . You 're not so bad yourself , Smithy . ' SARAH JANE LAUGHS There 's so much out there . Alien civilisations . When I was a kid , I never dreamed the universe could be so strange and beautiful . Finally , people I can talk to about this . It 's like a dream . Well , welcome to the club . I really like her . Yeah , me too ! She 's so much like Sarah Jane . Cooler car , though . This is proper good news . We 've got a new mate . Sarah Jane 's got someone to take the pressure off . Isn 't that what we 're for ? Oh , I love Clyde and Rani . They 're great kids , but ... they 're a different generation . I could do with a grown-up friend . I need a friend too . I got you so wrong the other day . My big mouth . No , no , you were right about one thing . I put children in danger . Today I nearly got them killed . Sonic lipstick , which I take everywhere with me . Except this afternoon , when I really needed it . Sonic lipstick ? ! SHE LAUGHS Well , now I really feel inadequate . You 've led a normal life . Nothing 's been normal for me . I was 23 , thought I knew it all . Just another day , chasing a story , trying to make my name . Then my world turned upside down . Oh , no . What happened ? I met him , didn 't I ? The man who changed my life . Who 's that ? He 's ... Erm ... Oh , it 's ... the Doctor .. Yes , the Doctor ! I 'm terrible with names , too , it 's no big deal . The man who changed my life . Who 's that ? He 's ... Erm ... Oh , it 's ... the Doctor . Yes ... the Doctor ! I 'm terrible with names , too . Finish replay . How could I forget his name , even for a second ? How could I ? Mr Smith . I want a full medi-scan . 'Of Ruby ? ' Of me . Do it ! ' Complying . ' 'Compiling scan data . ' 'Sarah Jane , I do not know how to ... . ' Well , just tell me ! 'There is evidence of deterioration of brain tissue , 'cognitive dysfunction , 'impaired reaction times . 'Damage is not serious , but it cannot be treated . 'I am sorry , you are very ill indeed . ' Listen , in my current condition , should I be given a position of responsibility and authority over other people 's lives ? 'Sarah Jane , it is not my ... ' I want an answer ! 'No . ' Thank you , Mr Smith . So ... no-one 's irreplaceable . Try it , it won 't bite ! THEY LAUGH It pongs , though ! LAUGHTER CONTINUES Are you sure about this , Ru ? Mum , it 's only one lesson ! Bye , Mrs Chandra ! Oh , Ru , call me Gita ! Call me Ruby . Ruby ... I can 't do this any more . What ? Don 't be stupid ! Mr Smith scanned me . Second best doctor I know . I 'm getting old , it 's too much for me . Ruby , look at my hands ! You need to calm down . Now , listen ! I am ill . My life has made me ill . I 'm old and I 'm tired and ... I 'm dangerous . I nearly got Clyde and Rani killed and ... no ! That must never happen again . No , it 's over . I 'm over . My story is finished . But this planet , it needs someone to protect it . Are you that person ? Are you the woman I think you are ? You want me to take over ? You 're so much like I used to be . Wait , we need to stop and think . We do not have time and don 't need to think . You 're the only other person in the world who could do this . I wouldn 't ask unless I was completely sure . If you agree , you get this house , you get Mr Smith , you get Clyde , Rani , you get everything . Yes or no ? I can 't suddenly decide something this big . Yes or no ! Yes . Right . Well , I 'm leaving right now . You can 't be serious ! I have to . If I don 't , I 'll change my mind . Well , what about Luke ? Doesn 't need me any more . He 's got his own life and I won 't be a burden to him . It 's harsh , but this life is harsh . Just remember ... One day , this 'll happen to you . So , it 's a deal ? It 's a deal . Right . Mr Smith ... program Alpha three , you delete my voice from the command program . Your orders now come from Ruby White . 'Do you think that is wise , Sarah Jane ? ' It 's an order ! My last order . 'Con ... confirmed . ' So , Sarah Jane ... what are you going to do with yourself now ? Oh , no plans . I 'm just going to drive off and see where I end up . Well , um ... It 's all yours . Keys . And the watch . Oh , yes ... I mustn 't forget this . Yes , now you 've got everything . Thank you . Oh ... Oh , are you OK ? I 'm fine ! We 're all going to miss you , Sarah Jane . Me and all your little chums . Wonderful , brilliant Rani and amazing , plucky Clyde . Oh , and your son ! Lukey wukey pukey . But you don 't want these . Your mind 's made up . No looking back , no goodbyes . You 're a hard woman , Sarah Jane ! What am I going to tell those poor , poor kids ? Wait , I can 't think . No time to think , you said . No-one 's going to change your mind , least of all me . No , I can 't leave . You can 't ? Not like this . I didn 't even say goodbye to Luke ! It 's the way you wanted it . Mr Smith , get Luke on the screen . Mr Smith ! He 's not answering ! Oh , silly me . Your voice has been erased from the command program , hasn 't it ? Yes , Ruby , please , patch me back in , I must talk to my son . No . What ? Ruby , please . What 's happening ? What 's happening is you 're not in charge any more . You gave me these . You gave me this place . And you gave me yourself . Well , what 's left of you . Ruby , no . Oh , ssh , ssh , don 't struggle . Where ... ? Where are we ? You 've got your secret attic . Welcome to my secret cellar . What is that ? You mean over there ? That 's my stomach . And it 's hungry for your soul . Yes , you are ill . I made you ill . I 've been draining you dry . Sucking your life force , every time we met , drop by drop . Would you like to see ? Ruby , please ! Ruby , no ! Ruby ! What are you ? I am Qetesh , my race devours the excitement and excesses of life , the adventures , the terrors , the thrills ! That 's why I came for you . Yours is the most exciting life on the planet . I trusted you . SHE LAUGHS Well ... I did my homework . A meteor , playing hard to get , saving you from the Dark Horde . Oh , you saw yourself in me and so did Clyde and Rani . Yeah , well , they 'll find me . Hmm , no . Right now , Mr White is back in the attic preparing a very , very touching farewell message . Clyde and Rani will believe you 've gone , because you 're going to tell them . No ! You handed me your life . Now my stomach can drain you directly . Soon it will drain you completely , and then my adventure begins ! I will feast on this world . Soon no-one on this planet will be safe from me . Ruby is taking my place . You put this in her head and she 's gone , like my dad ! It 's your fault ! That isn 't me ! I 'm almost upsetting myself . You 've got to get this message , you 've got to help ! She would never , ever just run off . 'Unit is of Qetesh origin . ' It 's the only way or Clyde and Sarah Jane will die . Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd E-mail : subtitling @ bbc.co.uk

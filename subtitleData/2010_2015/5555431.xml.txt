 MOHINDER : There are many ways to define our fragile existence , many ways to give it meaning . I love you . I love you , Nathan . MOHINDER : But it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context . Hiro , you 're very sick . Brain tumor . I 'm dying . MOHINDER : A private assortment of images , fears , loves , regrets , but we alone choose the importance of each . How do you feel , Hiro ? ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) MOHINDER : Building our own unique histories one memory at a time . What have you done ? Did you send a cello to my apartment ? PETER : Cello ? No . MOHINDER : Hoping the ones we choose to remember don 't betray or trap us . HIRO : There are no bad powers , Emma . You will learn to use your powers to do good things in the world . PETER : Where 'd you learn how to do that ? Medical school . I dropped out . PETER : Are you gonna go back to school ? Go be a doctor ? MOHINDER : For it is the cruel iron y of life that we are destined to hold the dark with the light , the good with the evil . You betrayed me . I 'm still your brother . SAMUEL I need you to start by retrieving some files from the apartment of a Mr. Noah Bennet . What do you want ? We don 't want anyone to get hurt . So , we 'll just take what we came for and we will be on our way . MOHINDER : This is what separates us , what makes us human . Gone . So are your files . MOHINDER : And in the - end , what we must fight to hold on to . GRETCHEN : Where did you get that ? I stole it from my dad . GRETCHEN : We came all this way to goto a carnival ? Claire . So glad you could make it . I think it 's time for some soul-searching . You 're welcome to stay a few days and do just that . I 'm gonna stay . Just for a couple days . LYDIA : I 'm not sure she 's going to serve a purpose for you . SAMUEL it 's not her I 'm after . Don 't worry about Eli , he 's harmless . Yeah . I 've caught him staring at me like three times . It 's that you 're new . Everybody 's talking . Talking 's okay with me . Staring , not so much . You have breakfast yet ? Yes , I had the blueberry pancakes , and they were amazing . Mmm . I 'm taking some to Samuel now . He is in his trailer . You know , how about you take them to him ? Score some points . Not that you need to , but he does love Mrs. Corney 's pancakes . ( LAUGHING ) Okay . Sure . Thank you , Claire . No problem . I hope you brought extra syrup . How 'd you know I had pancakes ? ( LAUGHING UNCOMFORTABLY ) I thought you were Lydia . That 's so very nice of you . That box in there looks a lot like the one from the paper company my dad used to work for . As you may have guessed , your father and I have shared more history than you know . Well , you can always fill me in . I 'm not interested in the past , Claire . Not when the future holds such infinite possibilities . The homeland you were talking about ? Yeah . And we 're almost there . And I 'd love nothing more than for you to stay and watch that come to fruition . Well , like I said , I do have to get back to class on Monday . Okay . Your loss . How do I look ? I 'm going to the city . Then you look very urban . Good . Because I need to make a positive impression . I 'm going to get someone . Someone essential for the plan coming together . Someone who can help us build a place where we can be free . " Freedom is what you do with what 's been done to you . " Sounds deep . Sartre . College . ( CHUCKLING ) I always thought freedom was just another word for nothing left to lose . That , too . You 'll see , Claire . We 'll stop running and find a permanent place to live . An ordinary place . Then you might even want to stay . Or go . It 's your choice . So she 's free to go ? Not in my lifetime . You make sure of that . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( WOMAN SHOUTING ) ( WOMAN SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO ) Samuel , what the hell are you doing ? Give it up , little brother . It almost moved this time . Let 's see . Wow . Far out . Now , come on . I 've got a show to do . Just you wait . I 'm gonna move bigger rocks than that . People are gonna come from all over the world to see me . You mean Vanessa 's gonna come see you ? " Oh , Vanessa-girl , come and see my big dirt-moving show . " Shut up . I can 't believe you 're still carrying a torch for that girl . Don 't you know we 're never going back there ? Tell you what , if you can get people to buy a ticket to see a kid not move a rock , I 'll invite her myself . You 're a jerk . Just you wait . Yeah . Just you wait , brother . Just you wait . AMANDA : Are you serious , Mom ? Come on . He 's nice . He just got here . I don 't even know him from Adam . I certainly don 't know his family . Since when do you care ? The answer is no . ( LAUGHING ) Something funny ? Sorry . No . No , no , no . I just ... I 've been looking for something normal in this place since this morning , and I finally found it when I was listening to you and your daughter argue . You sound like my mom and me . We had some serious knock-down drag-outs . Wonder if we had a place like this , if things would have been easier ? How so ? Lose a finger , it grows back , nobody looks twice . Oh , yeah . It 's paradise here . You don 't sound convinced . I didn 't mean anything by it . You know things , right ? I mean , you could see things , your tattoos . Sometimes . Why ? I was just wondering if you knew why Samuel wanted me here . Well , lately , he 's wanted a lot of people here . Half of them want to date my daughter . ( BOTH LAUGH ) Why 's he bringing so many people in ? It 's become an obsession of his . He spent all morning in his trailer . Yeah , with my dad 's files . Well , well . If it isn 't Nancy Drew . Is there something I can help you with , Nance ? I was just looking for Samuel . He 's not around . ( SIGHS ) Nice trick . I like to think so . Aren 't you on beautification duty ? Why don 't you run along and beautify ? ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Hiro . ( DOOR BUZZING ) Miss Coolidge ? Yes ? My name is Samuel . I 've come a long way to see you . I 'm like you . No , but I have a gift . Like you . Emma , please . Let me explain . You can read lips ? No , Emma , wait , wait , wait . I 'm the one who sent you the cello . ( HIRO SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SIGHING ) ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) ( SIGHING ) I 'm interested in people like us . I know that you can see things that other people hear , and that you feel them , oh , so much more . I know many people with gifts . And one of them can see from far away , and she helped me find you . We 're all connected , Emma . Thanks . I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you that was from me . Giving it away was not that easy . Why ? It was meant for someone else . Someone special in my life . She and I were close . And then one day , I lost her . May I ? ( SIGHING ) It 's found its proper home . I can see that now . No . It didn 't do that , you did . It was your own fear . That 's why I 'm here . You have to let go of that fear and release your true ability . I need your help . I 've tried , in my usual way , to find this man , but I 've been unsuccessful . He is overwhelmed by his gift , like you 've been , but so much more lost . He thought he was losing his mind when the moss and the flowers started growing in his footsteps . He lost touch with this world and fell into the cracks . I 'm told he lives in Central Park . ( PEOPLE CHATTERING ) Cover the exits . Now you know what it feels like . Yeah . Nice trick . What do you think you 're doing , Barbie ? ( PANTING ) Let me go . Not until you tell me why you were in Samuel 's trailer . Listen to me , okay ? You 're a spy , aren 't you ? Working for your father . No . I came here on my own . I believed what Samuel was saying was real , but he 's collecting people with abilities . Yeah . Why shouldn 't he ? We 're a family . You wouldn 't understand that , would you , Barbie , huh ? No . You only see the worst in people . Makes me wanna pin you to that trailer so Samuel can find you when he gets back . Samuel is using my dad 's old files to track people down and bring them in . He 's got a map of that valley out there , and he 's planning something . Yeah , and whatever it is , you 're gonna ruin it for everyone . I 'm not gonna let you . I 'm not gonna let you ruin it for me . ( SPEAKING JAPANESE ) Huh ? Hiro ... SAMUEL Your gift is more than seeing sound as color , putting cracks in a wall . EMMA : True ability . Well , what is it ? Your emotions can become one with the music . You can bring people to you . Like a siren 's song . Siren ? Just play , and you 'll see . Concentrate on him . Draw him to you . Now 's your chance . Make your prayers into song . ( PLAYING CELLO ) It 's all right . Let the music fill you up . Is he all right ? ( SIGHS ) I can 't thank you enough for getting him in . If you ever want to help more of us , there 's a place I 'd like you to visit . We could use a doctor , and a siren . This will help get you there . I will . Thank you . Thank you . She 's different . Like me . Not different . Special . I always thought I was alone in the world . I guess I 'm just a little scared . So many of us are , friend . So many . But not for long . Let 's go home . REPORTER : Sources confirm the remains found in the small plane crash are that cf New York Senator Nathan Petrelli . The NTSB is promising a complete and thorough investigation into the crash . At this time , investigators are reporting that the senator was the pilot and sole passenger of the plane . You 're getting weak . Otherwise you would have forced my mouth shut . Don 't tempt me , Barbie . I 'm telling you Samuel 's up to something . He 's lying to all of you . No . He 's a good man . Why are you so sure ? Because I 'm good now . This place is good for me . I haven 't done anything wrong since I got here . Joseph set me straight . He showed me what was good and true about my ability . Joseph ? Is that who 's in that picture there , next to Samuel ? Yeah . Samuel 's brother . He didn 't want to let me in at first . Samuel convinced him . Lydia said that Samuel 's obsessed with making the family bigger . Why do you think that Samuel 's bringing in all these people , huh ? Shut up ! This is my home how , Barbie . Listen to me . I don 't want to destroy this place . But if Samuel 's bringing people in for a reason , don 't you think that 's gonna put everyone in danger ? CLAIRE : You know me . Do you seriously think I want to destroy your home ? ( PANTING ) Talk to Lydia . She knows . Thank you . Lydia ? Claire , what are you doing here ? I just went into Samuel 's trailer . He has a map of the valley . What is he planning ? Lydia , you wanted me to go in there for a reason . Why ? You know something and you 're not telling me what it is . Samuel wasn 't ... Ha wasn 't always in charge . Joseph , he was our real father . He made this place a home . And I miss him . We all miss him . What happened to him ? He killed him , didn 't he ? Ha 's lost his way , Claire . I am scared for all of us . I woke up this morning and I wasn 't sure about this place . But this place is special . For you and for your daughter . Even Doyle . I ... The only thing wrong with it is Samuel . You have to help us . Please . You have to find someone that can stop him . I will . No buried treasure for you , Nancy Drew . What were you thinking ? You told me to watch her . She 's not a prisoner . If she wants to go , she can go . Not a prisoner ? It sure feels that way with Copy Boy over here . Don 't you ever get sick of him ? Stay or go , Claire . It 's still your choice . I 'll go . After you tell me what happened to Joseph . Eli , give us a minute . Did Lydia tell you ? No . I asked her . She wouldn 't . It 's true , isn 't it ? You killed him . I lost control . Like that is an excuse ? He told the government about us . You remember them , don 't you ? They lured him in . The very same people that 've been chasing us for years . Emile Danko , the same one who worked alongside your father , the man who imprisoned you , Claire . How do you think your father got the compass ? This is not about my father . Okay ? This is about what you did . ( PANTING ) What I did was awful . But Joseph put us all in danger . After years of running free , I wasn 't about to let him get away with that . I wasn 't about to let him take that away from us . So murder was the answer ? You , of all people , should understand how far a father will go to protect his family . Hasn 't your father lied , cheated , even killed to protect you ? What 's going on out in that valley ? SAMUEL Every artist needs his canvas , Claire . Ian ... Well , Ian is Picasso . I need water . That can be arranged . ( GROUND RUMBLING ) It 's beautiful . SAMUEL : It 's you . It 's who you are . It is beautiful . What is this place ? Our new home . My brother would have loved it He never believed it was possible . He certainly never believed I could make it real . This is why I need a bigger family . To build the future . This could be your home , too , Claire . I have a home . And I 'd like to go back to it . Of course . But just remember , you 're free , Claire . Whatever happens in your world back home , you can always come back to this one . Whenever you want . I know . ( CELL PHONE BUZZING ) MR. BENNET : Claire , we need to talk . Claire-bear , call me . Claire , hey , it 's Peter . You need to call me . Something happened . We have a lot to talk about . ( INAUDIBLE ) I 'm glad you 're safe . From what ? Where I came from , or this lie ? I know you took the compass . And I 'm not giving it back . My brother , Nathan , taught me a lot . Taught me how to ride a skateboard when I was a kid . How to hook a marlin . Taught me how to catch a baseball . Those are all things usually a father will teach his son . But Dad wasn 't around . So it was Nathan . I wish to hell it would have been my father , because Nathan didn 't make it easy . He 'd throw it high or he 'd throw it wide and I would yell at him . I 'd tell him to throw it right at me , but he 'd say to me , " That 's not how it 's gonna come at you in a game , Pete . " I used to think he was just being a big brother and he was picking on me . But now I understand . He just wanted me to be ready . For anything . I 'm ready , brother . For whatever comes . GUARD : Detail . A-ten-hut . Detail , halt . Flag .

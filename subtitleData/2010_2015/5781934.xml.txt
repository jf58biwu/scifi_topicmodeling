 I want to space on a 13 month solo mission I didn 't go home alone . My husband created a life like android Called it humanity His name is ethan , he 's the protype This is a story about earth Ethan ... . A story about family . A story about survival . Previously on extant ... Electronic voice : Beginning playback . Where is molly ? You haven 't the faintest idea What you 've put in motion with your little stunt . Concealing molly 's pregnancy , destroying her blood sample . You sent a text : " get out of the car . " I 'm not saying another word . You 'll probably want to talk . Your brother- - you did An exemplary job of covering up his past . Just leave my brother out of this . This is a situation of your own making , sam , And one that only you have the power to change . What do you want me to do ? ( barking ) what 's going on , boy ? ( growling ) aah ! He bit me ! Put that on the bite . Okay . Thanks . I don 't want anything to jeopardize our work or him . John : This is much more than my work now . It 's my family . Ethan ! ( electronic whirr , electrical crackling ) Ethan ! Come on , baby . Come on . ( aircraft whirring ) ( air hissing , machine clicking ) ¶ ( distorted sound of toaster lever clicking ) John : What a crazy night . I didn 't get any rest . I-I ... Feel so muddle-headed . Marcus ? Were you expecting someone else ? Your hair looks pretty . Hey . Have you seen my red duffel bag ? ( distorted sound of toaster buzzing , then clacking ) Marcus : Molly ? What do you want it for ? I 'm sorry . Maybe I just have baby brain-drain . Reentry training in the sims . It 's the last one . But it 's a dangerous drive down the cape in the rain . It 's a beautiful day . No . Please don 't go . I 'll come with you . I really wish you 'd turn the auto drive back on . I feel better if I 'm in control . They never let me turn the auto pilot off on the sims Unless we 're literally a million miles away from docking . Why don 't you take a nap ? Wear the restraints . I 've got my seat belt on . The other ones . What are these ? ( horn honking , tires squealing ) stop it ... I don 't like ... ( gasps ) ( panting ) ( sighs ) Ethan : Mom ? ( sighs deeply ) Are you okay ? I kept your secret . ( panting ) ( baby crying ) Ethan : The baby needs you . ( distorted shout ) ( dogs barking , men shouting in distance ) Molly ! Molly ! Molly ! Over here ! I found them ! Call an ambulance ! John : She 's three months pregnant . We 'll check her in transit . Please do it now . Uh , rus , I 'm not getting anything . Excuse me . Sir , you can 't move him ! Oh , ethan . ( sighs ) Help my wife ! Check the baby ! I can 't get a fetal heartbeat . Let 's go . Let 's go . John . Give us a hand . What happened ? She 's unconscious . We 're going back to the mainland . I called for an airlift . What 's-what 's happened ? I 'll let you know as soon as I know , okay ? ( siren wailing ) ( quiet , passionate breathing ; chimes tinkling ) ( passionate breathing continues ) ( both sighing ) We 're not gonna hang out and Get breakfast , are we ? No . I mean , thanks . You-you-you know what I mean . Good times . ( electronic blipping ) ( deep whirring ) ( clicking , whirring ) Play messages , last to first . Charlie : They just touched down at medplex metro ahead of schedule . Maybe I 've mentioned this a thousand times already , But it 'd be amazing if you 'd call me back ! I just talked to john out at the island . Ethan 's shut down at the core . Molly 's hurt . They 're flying them in to medplex metro . Call me back , jules . John , where am I ? It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're safe . You 're waking up . Offshore airlift . Hypothermia from exposure . Concussion with loss of consciousness . You 're in a hospital On the mainland- - you were unconscious from a fall . Deep lacerations to both legs and back . Where 's ethan ? Ethan is safe . Mrs. Woods , do you know what day it is ? Uh ... Monday . What-what about the baby ? How many weeks ? Molly : Fifteen . Oh , god . Did something happen to my baby ? Mrs. Woods , Have you experienced any bleeding or cramping In the past ten days to two weeks ? No . John , they took me somewhere . And they ... And they did something to me . No . No , no , no , no . They did something to me . No . Yes , they did , john . We 're going to sedate you , mrs . Woods , And get you checked out . Nuller ! And they took ... Is that really necessary ? Just try and relax . You need to stay out here , sir . Come on . Load it up . Two minutes till we 're ready . Then we 'll roll out , I guess . Julie ? I was trying to reach you . There is no change . My phone 's been bugging out . Charlie said ... The shutdown is at the root . Is molly okay ? Ethan must have sensed a catastrophic event During the fall , and shut himself down . There 's a chance his system integrity is interrupted , But his core is still active . He 'll be okay . What were they doing out in the woods ? Ethan got separated . How ? I 'll dock him and run the diagnosis crawler . And then a restart . Yeah . Oh , he 's so cold . It 's the warmers . They don 't draw power . I know why he 's cold . It 's just ... It 's just ... Strange . Molly will be waking up soon . I 'll get him back . Hi . Hi . Did ... So they ... Did they nuller me ? Yeah , I 'm afraid so . Yeah . Julie took ethan . She 's gonna check him out and reinitialize . She 's gonna wake him up ? Yeah . Wake him up . He 's in good hands . John ... Hmm ? Hello , I 'm dr . Gavin beck And I 'll be with you in just a moment To discuss any questions or concerns You might have about your ... I 'd like to keep you overnight for observation . The nanobiotics should prevent any complications From the lacerations , but the concussion deserves A 12-hour hold . Um , my baby ? Did we lose it ? Your hcg is baseline , Your uterus shows no sign of any implantation , let alone A recent miscarriage . I don 't understand . There was no pregnancy . What ? ! Uh ... Your body has not been pregnant In the recent past . John : Are you sure You have the right patient ? Woods ? Molly woods ? I want to see myself . We 're very busy today . Well , I need to see it . It 's a healthy uterus , but there 's no fetus there . Okay ? Well , that 's impossible . They 'll be by soon to move you upstairs . Medplex cares about the quality of treatment You received today . The following short assessment will help us to better serve- - You 're not allowed in here . There were blood tests , a scan- - The baby was fact , not fiction . Mr. Woods ... I 'm just simply suggesting That there must be some kind of a problem with your ... With your machines . Did you see the scan yourself ? Or do you " know " your wife was pregnant Because she told you she was ? If I were you , I might begin looking at this As a psychological issue , Not a physiological one . You can 't be in here . Where are you ? What the hell happened ? I 'm okay , daddy . They , um ... You know , patched me up pretty good . I 've been holding my breath . Thank god you 're all right , baby girl . What about ethan ? Please , tell me he 's not hurt bad . Well , john 's gonna run some tests on him , But it looks like he 's gonna be okay . If I 'd only known he was gonna run ... I know , daddy , it 's okay . I need your help right now , though . John and I ran some tests On one of my old genetics setups . It should have processed a result by now . No , I ... I already shut that thing down . Before it finished ? No , no , there ... There was a readout that said , uh ... There was an error with the samples . Do you have another ? I gotta go , daddy . Are you sure you 're all right ? Yeah . What ? He said I was crazy ? Okay . Right . Well , we gotta get out of here . Molly : I know what they did . They took it out of me and now they 're covering it up . The isea did this . Sparks admitted to doing All kinds of secret experiments , right ? Well , maybe they did all of this To take the baby . What , you got a better explanation ? Molly , I 'm on your side , but nothing makes sense . I was missing for six hours , you know . I know , but there is no pregnancy hormones . Did they just abort the baby And-and give you a full blood transfusion ? They wouldn 't have had time . They have all kinds of resources , okay ? They did this , and they 're covering it up . ( sighs ) Ethan may remember what happened When he wakes up . Sam- - She knows I was pregnant . She saw the scan ; she performed it . Change destination , please . Electronic voice : Changing destination . How is it our little man Only has class-one tears to his skin , But his neural net is freakin ' nuked ? Something scared him , And he pulled all his systems down . It was self-preservation . Yeah , he turtled , for sure , But why , lady ? Why ? I love that his skin just tears in straight lines . That 's , uh ... Nice work . Sorry . I just don 't understand How john could 've exposed him To this kind of risk . Ethan got lost in the woods . It could 've happened to any kid . It 's not any kid . All right . The crawler 's done . All right , let 's reboot this puppy . Remember when we actually built a puppy And I said that ? ( whispers ) : Yeah . ( clears throat ) ( sighs ) Say a prayer . ( electronic whirr , clank ) Charlie : There 's still damage at the core . This is gonna take a while . How did it make the trip ? Our concerns about keeping it alive Outside of the mother won 't be an issue . It 's surviving . It 's thriving . Electronic voice : Have a nice day . Don 't go anywhere . Electronic voice : Understood . Still no answer . Electronic voice : The door is open . Keep it that way . ( doorbell chimes ) ( sighs ) ( knocking at door ) Hey , molly . Sam , thank god . What 's going on ? Hey , john . Come on in . I have been calling you and calling you . I can see that . What on earth is wrong ? Has anyone been in touch with you ? About what ? Why do you have cuts on your hand ? Well , because john and I went to see my dad on the island . We were gonna do a test ourselves , But they followed us there . Who did ? Sparks . He 's behind the whole thing . You so saved me , sam . Molly , did you get an I.V. ? We just left the hospital . Molly blacked out . We were looking for ethan . They took the baby out of my body . I woke up this morning and the baby was gone . They 're covering their tracks . What baby ? Do you mean ethan ? The pregnancy ? Are you pregnant ? No . Molly ... That 's not even ... Possible . Wait , you-you honestly don 't know What we 're talking about ? I mean , you-you discovered it . You-you did the scan . What scan ? I ... Are who listening ? Oh , come on ! Molly , what were they treating you for At the hospital ? Was it a blackout , A head injury ? Okay . Are we really gonna play this game ? I 'm not playing any game . I 'm trying to react to you as a friend ... No , as a friend , You told me to get out of that car . John : You called me after the party And I said she 'd gone to the isea with sparks , And you sounded worried . I was worried . You were acting so strange that night . The text is gone . They erased it ! Honestly , I don 't ... I ... What do you want me to say ? What do they have on you ? Huh ? Molly ... If there 's any part of you That trusts me right now , Please , go back to the hospital . They better have a gun to your head . Sam : John ... I 'm so sorry ... But something happened to her up there . She 's right to be paranoid . But it 's a brain issue . She needs to be seen . Take her far away from whatever it is she 's suspicious of , But please , just get her some help . Please . Molly : They got to her . They 're trying to make me look crazy . ( phone ringing ) Hello ? We 'll be right there . What ? It 's ethan . Something 's wrong . He 's not waking up . Yasumoto towers . Whatever caused him to shut down . Was catastrophic . His systems are trying to rebuild Everything he is from scratch . He 's still in there . I know he is . Is there anything we can do ? Well , it 's not as simple as reloading a backup . Ethan 's complexity has out-paced our ability To repair him . We could try forcing an engagement , With his body to speed up the process but ... No . Interfering could be disastrous . Even when we 've modeled a flawless restart , There 's still potential for cognitive and memory loss . He might not be who he was before he shut down . So ... Basically , he 's in a coma ? Julie : Basically . All we can do is wait . ( sighs ) I want someone by his side 24-7 . Really ? But he 's not even gonna know we 're here . We 'll know . ( sighs ) Ethan 's hurt because of me . They used him to lure me out of the house . Who knows what happened ? We have to get inside the isea . It 's the only way we 're gonna get any answers . Hey , well ... I-if you don 't believe me ... Hey , I-I ... I don 't know what I believe . That 's the truth . I-I know something happened to you on the mission Because you came back changed . I-I know , I know you believe you were pregnant ... No . I was pregnant . We spent years trying to have this baby . We wanted it so badly . So I ... What ? I saw what I wanted to see ? No ... Huh ? All of it ? You were alone with sam during the test . I wasn 't with you when she warned you about sparks . Everything I know about this pregnancy I know from you . And we both know you 've been hallucinating . Yeah , well , I know when I 'm hallucinating , okay ? I 've had a lot of practice lately . I 'm not saying it wasn 't real to you . I am not imagining a baby . Listen ... It doesn 't matter if I believe you or not . But if I 'm not sure it happened , Then I guarantee you the rest of the world Will be certain it didn 't . Okay . You let me know if anything changes with ethan . Molly , where are you going ? It does matter , john , If you believe me . His program architecture is resilient . He 's strong . He gets it from us . He gets it from molly , too . Can I take a shift ? Soon . What happened out in those woods ? I don 't know . I guess we 'll find out when he wakes up . ( alarm beeping ) John ? ! What are you doing ? ! Trying something . His systems are ready . You can 't engage his body yet ! He needs some kind of stimulus . He needs to know we 're here . It 's too soon ! Ethan ? Do you hear me ? ( raspy , distorted ) : Who are you ? It 's me- - dad . Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Electronic voice : Shutting down . How could you do that ? It 's just as risky to do nothing . So ... That was ... That was ... Good ? The truth is ethan is in an undiscovered country right now . Neither of us knows what 's going on there . The truth ? How about you want to find out what ethan knows About what happened to molly ? I do , but I didn 't put him at risk . Taking him to the island was putting him at risk . You didn 't even tell me you were going ! We built him together , john . From coding to body-mapping Through every stage of development , And then every big decision that needs to be made , You just make it . Did I need your permission To take him to see his grandfather ? That 's not what I 'm talking about . We were gonna find the best home for ethan . We were auditioning families When you just ... Took him home . But you-you-you , you never objected . What was I gonna say- - I know you guys can 't have Kids of your own but I think it 'd be better For ethan to be with someone else ? I 'm not saying he 's in the wrong place . I know ethan wouldn 't be who he is without you . But you 're not his parent . And I don 't need your permission to make any decisions here . You work for me . We 're not partners . ¶ How 's ethan ? I don 't know . I was impatient . I tried to rush things . He 's back to where he was . Molly ... I want to believe . If you can just help me see How can all of this be true . Okay . I can 't . Something terrible happened to me- - Unthinkable- - and I don 't have proof . Now , I know ... That 's hard for you ... You need a leap of faith . Yeah . But if I take the leap and I 'm wrong ... ? And I 'm crazy ? ( chuckles ) Nothing would make me happier right now Than to be crazy . ( chuckles ) I can 't lose you . Please , don 't give up on facts now . The only chance I 've got is to keep fighting from the inside . But why would they keep you around ? Well , because they think They 've neutralized the threat . Sam was the only one who had proof Of the baby on that blood test . And they tied her up pretty good . They covered up everything . Everything they knew about . The dog . Remember gus ? Yeah . He bit me . Sparks doesn 't know about that . ( laughs ) John : Yeah . I gotta go call my dad . Thank you , daddy . ( sighs ) Baby girl . Hey , what the hell do you want With a bloody towel ? ¶ See you at 4 : 00 . Dr. Beck , uh , do you have a moment ? ( distant ) : John woods . You treated my wife molly . Beck : Yes ? I just wanted To apologize for my behavior yesterday . I had no right to come after you that way . There 's no need . I see you didn 't stay the night , like I asked . John ( distant ) : Well , she was panicking , And I felt much better for her to be home . Sorry . As long as her symptoms didn 't get any worse . But you were right . I-I was seeing what I wanted to see . We all do that . If you 'll excuse me ... Yeah . But she 's getting worse . Uh , now that you 've opened my eyes , I realize she 's been living in this , In this fantasy world for quite some time . I can have my office give you the contact information . There are also at-home therapy options , If you don 't mind a simulant . Now , I really need to be going . John : Oh , " a simulant " ? Beck : An artificially generated therapy option . The units are excellent . John : A robot therapist ? I-I don 't know that I 'd trust That kind of thing helping my wife . Do they really work ? Beck : Just get in touch with my office . ( quietly ) : Come on . Uh , sorry . I ... I-I just to , uh , thank you again . And , uh , did you , did you give me you contact information ? ( clattering in distance ) You know , uh , I 'll let you escape now . Thanks for all the help . Molly : This proves it . They tried to make me think I was crazy . There was a baby . Okay , but why admit to getting you pregnant , And then cover it up ? I don 't know . But this blood analysis shows that it was part me . And this other dna- - well , I 've never seen anything like it . ( sighs deeply ) So what sparks was saying About me being the father , that 's ... ( sighs ) I 'm sorry . I believed him when he said it was ours . But I 've gotta find out what they did to me . You said it yourself : The only way is from the inside . Yeah . So I 've gotta get myself back to work , Pretend I believe their story , Act crazy and confused , And chalk it all up to a bad reentry . Act like you believe it , and they will , too . We can 't trust anybody , john . Not sam , not anybody . No . But we can trust each other . Do you think we ... ? I 've been worried as hell about you . They told me that you were admitted To a hospital After an airlift this morning . I had to get away , okay ? I panicked . I 'm sorry . You could 've killed us both . I was trying to help you , molly . Help me . You saved my life . It was crazy of me thinking I was pregnant . I 'm-I 'm embarrassed that I lost touch with reality like that . It 's painful to see someone you love Not act like themselves . Yeah , well , I-I-I scared everybody I loved . Okay ? Even myself . I need another chance . I want to come back to work . ( quiet laugh ) I 'm not kryger . No , you 're not . He wasn 't as strong as you . But I suggest you take some time . You think about this . No , no , no , no . I worked too hard for everything I 've got . I don 't want to lose that now . All right . We 're all here to help you get healthy , molly . But I won 't lie to you . Given your condition , We 'll be watching you very carefully . I 'd expect that . I 'm not gonna let you down . Welcome back . Thank you . I know you 're there . You smell better than anyone else in this building . ( both laugh ) Well , that 's not saying much . You know , you should go away more often . ( over speaker ) : While you were gone , I found out that you were wrong About two things : First , oh , that , uh , sales rep Was trying to seduce me . I wasn 't imagining it . I 'm happy for you , danny . I 'm sure it had nothing To do with that centrifuge he was trying to sell . Danny : You know what ? Promise me . When our research makes a deep-space colony viable , I get to go first . By myself . Molly : You don 't mind , do you ? " mind " ? I 've been hanging out With our dead worms . ( music playing ) Danny : Speaking of which ... ( music drowning out conversation ) This is the cam From the deep-space probe as it was returning To the seraphim on the mission . So , this was about ... 6,400 miles up . Where all the worms died- - right ... There . Yeah , well , I was looking at that . But I couldn 't find anything . Either could I ... Which only leaves one possibility . You messed up and contaminated the samples Before the probe left the station . Molly : Right . Danny : No , wrong . You don 't mess up . Hey ! Do you want to do this another time ? No , no ! Um , go . Well , I kept at it , and then I discovered . This . Oh , a new filter . Mm-hmm . I called it algorithm danny 5 . But , here , here , here . Watch . Right at 6,392 miles out . It 's a wave of interlaced Energy fields . I mean , it oscillates so fast , No single frequency shows up . That 's why we never found it . I 've never seen anything like it . So , it moves like energy , but it contaminates . More like a spore . What is it ? Where did it come from ? I don 't know . Looks like you found our worm killer . ( laughs quietly ) ( phone ringing ) Hey , john . Ethan ? When ? I 'm on my way . He did it on his own . Julie noticed it first . 20 minutes ago , everything just comes back up . He 's asleep , but he 's in there . He 's smiling . Wouldn 't you ? Ethan . Hey , ethan . Molly : Hey . Mom . Welcome back . We missed you . Time to go home . I 'm so tired . Well , dad said it 's gonna take some time to feel all better . A lot of rest . Okay . I was so scared when you were gone . Do you remember what happened ? Anything ? No . Can I get a drink ? No , no , no , no . You stay right here . I 'll do that . Don 't get used to this kind of treatment . ( chimes tinkling gently ) ( distorted sloshing sound ) Were you expecting someone else ? ( gasping ) Where did it come from ? Hey , boss . I 'm just leaving . Hey , danny , can you send me the new algorithm ? Uh , your file ? Yeah , but you 're not gonna guilt me into staying late . ( wry laugh ) no guilt . Okay . There you go . Thank you . Okay . Load file . Index day 307 , Hour 14 . Is this ... ? Yeah . When I saw marcus . Pause . Insert filter , algorithm danny 5 . Index play . ( whooshing , hissing on video ) ( whooshing , hissing continue ) ( keypad blipping , door latch clacking ) The transfer to the life support cell is complete . All vitals are strong . What the hell is it ? It 's a boy . Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

 MAN : The Grid . A digital frontier . I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer . What did they look like ? Ships ? Motorcycles ? Were the circuits like freeways ? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I 'd never see . And then , one day ... BO Y : You got in . MAN : That 's right , man. I got in . MAN : And the world was more beautiful than I ever dreamed and also more dangerous than I ever imagined . Hop in bed , now , kiddo . - Now , I met a brave warrior . - Tron . Bom-ba-bom-bom bom ! Tron ! BO Y : He fights for the users . MAN : He sure does . Oh , man , he showed me things that no one had ever imagined . There were these disk battles fought in spectacular arenas . Cycles that raced on ribbons of light . it was so radical . MAN : And together ... BO Y : You built the Grid . MAN : We built a new grid for programs and users . Now , I couldn 't be in there all the time , so I created a program in my own image that could think . Like you , and me . And I called him Clu . - Codified Likeness Utility . - MAN : That 's right . And Clu , Tron and I , we built the system , where all information was free and open . Beautiful . And then , one day , something happened . Something extraordinary . A miracle . What was it ? That 'll have to wait till next time . I gotta get to work . I wanna go with you , Dad . Yeah , well , one day you will . I promise . - To the Grid ? - Good night , Sam . Hey , what do you say tomorrow you and I hit the arcade ? You can have a crack at the old man 's high score . - First game 's on me . Can we play doubles ? On the same team ? We 're always on the same team . Good evening . Our lead story . ENCO M CEO and video game icon Kevin Flynn has disappeared . He was best known for designing Tron and Space Paranoids , the two bestselling video games in history . Flynn took ownership of ENCO M in 1 982 as the company skyrocketed to the top of the tech industry . But things changed in 1 985 with the untimely death of Flynn 's wife , the mother of his young son , Sam . Recently , ENCO M board members have been troubled by reports of Flynn 's erratic , even obsessive , behaviour . With Flynn missing , the company is now in chaos . This afternoon , ENCO M 's board moved to seize control from Flynn 's partner , Alan Bradley , vowing to return the company to profitability . Loyal to the end , Bradley maintains his belief that Flynn is not missing and is instead pursuing his dream of " a digital frontier to reshape the human condition . " Kevin : in there is a new world . in there is our future . in there is our destiny . TV : Even Flynn 's most ardent supporters are now acknowledging a difficult truth . Kevin Flynn may have simply run away . And while Flynn 's loyalists hope for his imminent return , there is perhaps no one who wishes it to happen more than young Sam Flynn , now in the care of his grandparents , and heir to an empire in turmoil . SAM : He 's coming . He promised . - Sam , you have to eat . - Let go of me ! Sam ? What will become of Flynn 's legacy and the future of ENCO M will most likely depend on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy . on what becomes of this now orphaned little boy . GRANDMOTHER : Sam ! Come back ! Radio : All cycle units , stand by . Radio : All units , stand by . Now that is a big door . WOMAN : Welcome , everybody . Please settle. I know it 's late , so I 'll skip the pleasantries and hand things over to our chairman , Richard Mackey . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Claire . Tonight I am pleased to announce that ENCOM 's last fiscal year was our most profitable ever . Yes . At midnight the 1 2th version of our flagship operating system will hit the shelves around the world . I 'm sure it comes as no surprise whom we have to thank . The head of our software design team , a man whose father 's own notable history with ENCOM helped make this company what it is today . Edward Dillinger . Well done . Well done . And this year , simultaneous to the release of ENCOM OS-1 2 , we will be making our debut on Tokyo 's Nikkei index . ENCOM 's stock will now trade around the world 2 4l7 . - Huh ? Oh , yes . - Excuse me . - Yes , Alan ? ALAN : Given the prices that we charge to students and schools , what sort of improvements have been made in Flynn ... I mean , ENCOM OS-1 2 ? - This year we put a " 1 2 " on the box . OS-1 2 is the most secure operating system ever released . The idea of sharing our software or giving it away for free disappeared with Kevin Flynn . GUARD : I know you 're here . Let 's make this easy . Come on , come on . Freeze ! Richard : Okay . If there are no more questions , I would like you to meet our next blockbuster . ENCOM OS-1 2 . Whoa . Still a few bugs . What 's that ? What is that ? Just bear with us one sec . Make this go away now . Stop what you 're doing . Stop . Stop for one second . TV : ... where ENCO M 's chairman , Richard Mackey , will be launching ... Richard : We go live in 30 seconds . GUARD : He 's on the roof ! - Anyone know where the master file is ? - ALAN : I do . it 's on the Web . Richard : We 've got to stop this . I 've got to ring that opening bell . - Make this stop now . - it 's locked . Just shut it down . Shut it down ! Now ! Relax , Mackey . Relax . it 's under control . Relax ? Our most valuable and most secure operating system is out there for free ! How am I supposed to explain that ? I don 't know . Say it was all part of the plan . A little gift from ENCOM . TV : Apparently , ENCO M Technology is having some technical difficulties . Why don 't we give them a chance to sort things out ? Hey , Dad . How you doing ? - GUARD : Where you goanna run to now ? - Hey , you don 't wanna do that . GUARD : Didn 't anyone tell you ? Stealing is wrong . SAM : You can 't steal what was designed to be free . - Now I got you . - Your boss is okay with this . The hell he is . SAM : Your boss works for the CEO and the CEO works for the shareholders . Do you know who the biggest shareholder is ? I don 't know . Some kid . You 're Mr. Flynn ? Why ? This is your father 's company . - Not anymore . - What ? Hey . Hey , kid . GUARD : No ! Yeah . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! You kidding me ? - That 's him ! Get the team down here ! - There he is ! Get him ! What the ... Hey ! No free ride ! - Whoa ! - No free taxi ! - You pay ! - Whoa , whoa , whoa ! - No free ride ! Policeman : Hold it right there . Freeze ! Okay , boys . You got me . Hey . - Hey , Karl . - Hey , how you doing ? Enjoy it , Marv . You earned it . Why are you in my apartment , Alan ? You don 't answer your phone . - How you been , Sam ? - Oh , you know , when I was 1 2 , I appreciated the surrogate-father thing . But come on . I got it all under control now . Oh . Clearly ! You want to help me with my homework ? Like old times ? Have a catch ? You know , you got a pretty nice view here . Heard you did a triple axel off of her a few hours ago . - Rough landing , huh ? - Could have been worse . I also thought your message to the board was very clever . Did you like that ? That was Marv 's idea . Alan , are we really going to do this again ? Do I really look like I 'm ready to run a Fortune 500 company ? No . And truthfully , the company is pretty happy with where you are , too . I bet . That way they can keep doing whatever they want . You know , I guess what I find curious is the crazy charities , the annual prank on the company . You have an interesting way of being disinterested , Sam . Why are you here , Alan ? I was paged last night . Oh , man , still rocking the pager ? Good for you . Yeah , your dad once told me I had to sleep with it , and I still do . Page came from your dad 's office at the arcade . - So ? - So ? That number 's been disconnected for 20 years . Sam , two nights before he disappeared , he came to my house . " l 've cracked it , " he kept saying . He was talking about genetic algorithms , quantum teleportation . He said he was about to change everything . Science , medicine , religion . He wouldn 't have left that , Sam . He wouldn 't have left you . Oh , Alan . You 're the only one who still believes that . He 's either dead or chilling in Costa Rica . Probably both . Look , I 'm sorry . I 'm tired , and I smell like jail . Let 's just reconvene in another couple of years , huh ? What do you say ? Here . These are the keys to the arcade . I haven 't gone over there yet . I thought you should be the one . Alan , you 're acting like I 'm goanna find him sitting there working . Just , " Hey , kiddo . Lost track of time . " Wouldn 't that be something ? - What ? You son of a gun . Flynn . Huh . Let 's try the back door . What were you working on ? Laser Control . Okay . This isn 't happening . Oh , man , this is happening . Wait . This program has no disk . Another stray . Hey , wait . Wait. I 'm not a program ! He actually did it . I 'm on the Grid . Does the name Kevin Flynn mean anything to you ? Be quiet if you want to live ! MAN : Not the games , not the games , not the games , not the games ... What 's his problem ? - Not the games , not the ... Rectify . Rectify . - Games . - No . Please ! Rectify . You probably get this a lot , but there 's been a big mistake . Games . - Please , no , no . - Whoa . Hey . No ! Erase me ! No ! Wait ! Wait ! Er , can somebody tell me what the ... Hey , hey. it 's got a zipper . He is different . This can 't be good . COMPUTER : Attention , program . You will receive an identity disk . Everything you do or learn will be imprinted on this disk . If you lose your disk or fail to follow commands , you will be subject to immediate de-resolution . Mirroring complete . Disk activated and synchronized . Proceed to games . SAM : Games ? Where are you going ? What am I supposed to do ? Survive . COMPUTER : All combatants , prepare for disk wars . CROWD : Disk wars ! Disk wars ! Disk wars ! Disk wars ! Disk wars ! Platform 8 . I have a three-inch version of you on my shelf . Combatants 3 and 11 . Disk wars . You definitely didn 't do that . Damn it ! So that 's how it is . Combatant 11 , de-resolution . I won . Now let me out ! Combatant 3 , round one , victory . No unusual activity on the Grid . Security sweeps and patrols have been intensified . Rectifier on schedule . Your initiative should be fully operational within 1 2 cycles . Perhaps if you were to include me in this initiative , I could be of even greater service . Combatants 3 and 7 , disk wars . Combatants 3 and 7 , disk wars . initiate . Yeah. I 'm out . Combatant 3 , victory . Combatant 3 , violation . Combatant 6 , de-resolution . What is that program ? Combatant 3 , violation . initiate final round . Combatant 3 versus Rinzler . CROWD : Rinzler ! Rinzler ! You gotta be kidding me . CROWD : Rinzler ! Rinzler ! Rinzler ! Rinzler ! Rinzler ! Come on. ls that even legal ? Why do I feel like I just got dumped on ? Come on . Huh ? Come on . CROWD : De-rez ! De-rez ! De-rez ! User . identify yourself , program . - l 'm not a program . identify . My name is Sam Flynn . Bring him to me . Let me go . Freaks . Where am I ? SAM : Am I on the Grid ? Who are you ? Dad . Sam . Look at you , man . Look at the size of you . - How did you get in here ? - l got your message . Oh . So it 's just you ? Yeah . Just you . Oh . isn 't this something ? You look the same . A lot 's happened , Sam . More than you can imagine . Disk . Let 's have a look . Got it . Hmm. I expected more . So , you were trapped in here . That 's right . - And you 're in charge . - Right again . You 're two for two . So can we just go home now ? Not in the cards . Not for you . That 's a hell of a way to treat your son . Oh , that . I 'm not your father , Sam . But I 'm very , very happy to see you . Clu . Where is he ? What did you do to him ? Same thing I 'm going to do to you , user . - Greetings , programs . Oh , what an occasion we have here before us . Because your rumours are true . We do indeed have in our midst a user ! A user . So , what to do ? What does this user deserve ? Might I suggest perhaps the challenge of the Grid ? And who best to battle this singular opponent ? Perhaps one who has some experience in these matters . Oh , yes , indeed , programs . Your liberator ! Your luminary ! Your leader and maker ! The one who vanquished the tyranny of the user those many cycles before ! CLU : I 've been waiting a long time for this . Jarvis : Clu ! You wanna play ? I 'll play . Excellent words , sir . Were you pleased with my execution ? The crowd seemed quite energized . CLU : it wasn 't meant for them . What 's this ? What do I do with this ? I 'll give you a hint . Not that . COMPUTER : Grid is live . initiate light cycle battle . You got no chance , user . Their bikes are faster than ours . Use the levels . Now this I can do . Here we go . Come on . Come on ! Hey ! We gotta work together . it 's the only way . That 's it . You got me . Boo ! - Whoo-hoo ! - Yeah ! Now that 's what I 'm talking about . Another customer . Let 's go ! Hang on , buddy , I 'm coming . Come on . illegal combatant on the Grid . Get in . illegal combatant on the Grid . Get in ! System failure . Release Rinzler . Game on , old friend . - Who are you ? - Hang on . Pull up , man , you can 't make that ! Driver : Made it . I 'm Quorra . They 're turning around . Not by choice . Their vehicles can 't go off Grid . They 'll malfunction on this terrain . - What about us ? - Obviously not . - Where are you taking me ? - Patience , Sam Flynn . All your questions will be answered soon . SAM : Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! Wait here . MAN : Quorra . I dreamed of Tron . First time in years . QUORRA : it 's a sign . MAN : A sign , my dear apprentice , of a weary soul . MAN : I 'm afraid something 's happened . QUORRA : Something has happened . We have a guest . MAN : There are no guests , kiddo . Sam ... SAM : Long time . You have no idea . You 're ... You 're here . You 're here . I 'm here . You 're big . You 're ... Old . Kevin : How did you get here ? Alan came over . Bradley . Yeah . He got your page . I found your office under the arcade . Page ... Oh , the page . Of course . Clu had him on the light cycle grid . I intervened . Oh . Dinner soon . We 'll talk then . He never thought he 'd see you again . Yeah . Vintage . Flynn built it many cycles ago for the games . QUORRA : it doesn 't get out as much as it used to , but it 's still the fastest thing on the Grid . QUORRA : Do you know it ? His patience usually beats out my more aggressive strategy . Flynn shared them with me . I 've read them all . Oh . Light reading . Tolstoy . Dostoyevsky . l-Ching . Journey Without Goal . Must have a killer ending . Flynn is teaching me about the art of the selfless , about removing oneself from the equation . But between you and me , Jules Verne is my favourite . - Do you know Jules Verne ? - Sure . What 's he like ? Your move , Flynn , come on . Come on ! QUORRA : How old are you now , Sam ? Kevin : You should be 2 7 . SAM : Yes , 2 7 . QUORRA : Do you attend a college ? SAM : Caltech . Caltech . My alma mater . SAM : Yeah . Till I dropped out . Work ? - Kevin : Job ? ENCOM ? Are you ... - No . I check in once a year . - Wife , girlfriend ? - Dog . Marvin . - A rescue . - Kevin : Well , dogs ... Dogs are cool . I 'm sure you must have a few questions of your own , Sam . Actually , just one . Why I never came home . Those nights when I went to the office , I 'm sure you 've figured it out by now , I was coming here . Human form into digital space . Heavy stuff . But I also had you . I had ENCOM . I couldn 't be in here all the time . I needed partners to help out . Tron and Clu ? That 's right . Kevin : Tron was created by Alan for the old system . I brought him here to protect this one . Clu was my creation . A program designed to create a perfect world . We were jamming , man , building utopia . Hours in here were just minutes back home . Just when I thought it couldn 't get any more profound , something unexpected happened . The miracle . The miracle . You remember . lSOs. isomorphic algorithms . - A whole new life form . - And you created them ? No . No . They manifested , like a flame . They weren 't really from anywhere . The conditions were right and they came into being . For centuries we 've dreamed of gods , spirits , aliens , an intelligence beyond our own . You seeing this ? I found them in here . Like flowers in a wasteland . Profoundly naive . Unimaginably wise . They were spectacular . Everything I 'd hoped to find in the system , control , order , perfection , none of it meant a thing . I 'd been living in a hall of mirrors . The lSOs shattered it . The possibilities of their root code , their digital DNA . Disease ? History . Science , philosophy , every idea man has ever had about the universe up for grabs . Bio-digital jazz , man . The is Os , they were going to be my gift to the world . SAM : So what happened ? Kevin : Clu . Clu happened . TRON : Your transport to the portal is waiting for you . I don 't like it when you cut it this close . Kevin : Will you stop worrying , Tron ? Everything 's just fine . - Everything 's under control . - CLU : Flynn ! Am I still to create the perfect system ? Yeah . Kevin : it was a coup . TRON : Go . CLU : You 've been corrupted . Why ? Why ? Flynn , go ! Kevin : Tron , he fought for me . I never saw him again . So why didn 't you fight ? - Kevin : Hmm . - He did . Kevin : Clu fed on my resistance . The more I fought , the more powerful he became . it was impressive , really . And my miracle ... Clu saw the is Os as an imperfection . So he destroyed them . The Purge . - He killed them all ? - it was genocide . I tried to get back but I couldn 't get to the portal . it uses massive power and it can 't stay open forever . And like a safe , it ... it can only be opened from the outside . it closed on me , Sam . That 's why I never came home . SAM : So the portal , it activated when I came in . So it 's open now . Kevin : Not for long . Only one millicycle , about eight hours . So we go now . Go home . We make a run for it . - We get you out of here . - Don 't rush . What do you mean ? The portal 's goanna close . What ? What is it ? The moment Flynn is on the Grid , Clu will stop at nothing to obtain his disk . My disk is everything , Sam . it 's the master key . The golden ticket . The way out . - And not just for me . - What do you mean ? Our worlds are more connected than anyone knows . Clu figures if I can be in ... SAM : He can be out ? Kevin : With my disk , it 's possible . SAM : And then what ? Game over . The guy doesn 't dig imperfection . What 's more imperfect than our world ? I can 't let that happen. I won 't . So what do we do ? Nothing ? it 's amazing how productive doing nothing can be . Clu 's planning something . We 've known that for a while . Programs have been disappearing . There 's unrest out there , even revolution . If we sit tight , Clu might be brought down from the inside . SAM : If the portal is closing , we can 't sit around . We have to move now . Tell me , what brought you here , to the Grid ? Alan got your page . I didn 't send any page . it was Clu . Clu sent that page . That 's why you 're here . This is all his design . He wanted a new piece on the board to change the game ! With you , he got more than he ever dreamed . This is precisely what he wants . Us together heading for the portal . it 's his game now . The only way to win is not to play . Well , that 's a hell of a way to live . But it is a way . We can go home . Don 't you want that ? Sometimes life has a way of moving you past things like wants and hopes . That 's great , Dad . Keep telling yourself that . Good night , Sam . How can he be so afraid of his own creation ? I mean , he built Clu . Why doesn 't he just end him ? He could , but it would require reintegration . Yeah , all right . Flynn would never survive the event . it would mean the end of them both . If he refuses to save himself , then I will . How ? I 'm going through the portal . Clu wants Flynn 's disk , not mine . I 'm going to find Alan and we 'll figure this thing out from the other side . This may be Clu 's game here , but in my world , he 's gone in one keystroke . But I can 't do anything unless I get to the portal . And my guts tell me that you don 't want to be stuck in this place for eternity either . I really think you should consider your father 's wisdom . I have . There 's someone I once knew , a program named Zuse who fought alongside the isos . They say he can get anyone anywhere . SAM : How do I find him ? QUORRA : This is his sector . Make it there alive , and he 'll find you . Sam ? Sam ? COMPUTER : All programs are required to present identity disks at city checkpoints . Hey , man. it 's your lucky day . - Any program without their disk ... - Stop him ! ... will be taken into custody . Any program in violation of their function is subject to termination . FEMALE Voice : Sam Flynn ? You remember me ? - Yeah . You gave me some advice . - And you followed it . it 's unfortunate we met the way we did . You have a good night . You 're looking for someone . What makes you say that ? intuition . Sir , the sentries downtown have recovered Flynn 's light cycle . We 've traced it to its point of origin . Kevin : Prepare the light runner , Quorra . We 're going downtown . Thank you for bringing my son to me . QUORRA : Flynn ! You don 't need to go . I 've sent him to someone we can trust . Quorra , there is no choice . I won 't lose him again . Chaos . Good news . Relax . They 're occupied . His name is Castor. lf you want to speak to Zuse , you need to go through him . CASTOR : Where 's your sense of humour , my friend ? MAN : Programs are disappearing . Soon none of us will be left . Zuse can unite the factions , foment revolution . - Of course Zuse can do these things . - Grant me an audience . Your enthusiasm is intoxicating , my dear Bartik , but Zuse 's time is precious . We shall see . I brought your boy Flynn . If you 'll excuse me for a moment , I have to attend to something . But have a drink , courtesy of the End of Line Club ! it is happening . Come , away from these primitive functions . The son of Flynn . Of all the innumerable possibilities , he has to walk into mine . Libations for everybody ! I 'm Castor , your host . Provider of any and all entertainments and diversions . At your service . I 'm looking for Zuse . indeed . Many are . Where can I find him ? This , pretty miss , is a conversation best had behind closed doors . Perhaps we should retire to my private lounge . I designed it myself , you know. it 's true . I 'm stepping away for a moment , boys . Change the scheme , alter the mood . Electrify the boys and girls if you 'd be so kind . - Thank you . Gem . My name is Gem . Cozy . - You are Clu . - l am Clu . - You will create the perfect system . - l will create the perfect system . Together we 're goanna change the world , man . Let 's move . CASTOR : Zuse has been around since the earliest days of the gaming grid . By necessity , he has to mind all the percentages . All the angles . So when do I meet him ? You just did . After the Purge , I needed to reinvent myself . Self-preservation , you understand . Now , what can I do for you ? I need to get to the portal . Well , it 's closing quickly , as I 'm sure you 're aware . Tick-tock , tick-tock . And it 's quite the journey . Beyond the far reaches of the Outlands . Your father didn 't want any programs slipping out accidentally , did he ? - Can you help me ? - Of course . But first , as a man who prides himself on staying well informed , I must ask who sent you my way . Her name 's Quorra . Said she met you a long time ago . indeed she did . Many cycles ago . it was a different time . But we 're not here to relive the past . Let 's see about your future , shall we ? We 'll have to change your attire and you 'll need a forged disk . Not easy these days . And of course you 'll need transport to cross the Sea of Simulation . This is going to be quite the ride . I believed in users once before . Playing all the angles . Resist ! The game has changed , son of Flynn ! I met your friend . He 's fantastic ! Behold ! The son of our maker ! Yeah ! Yeah , yeah ! Yeah , yeah ! Go , go ! Let 's split , man . Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ! A little help here maybe ? SAM : Your disk . Dad , it 's gone . it is . I 'm sorry. I know I messed up . We can go back . - l can go back . - No , we stay together . - Dad , I can do this . - You 've done enough already ! Sam , you 're really ... You 're messing with my Zen thing , man . She 's stable . - SAM : So what do we do now ? - l don 't know . Nothing . We do nothing . Be still . Wait . You ever jump a freight train ? Huh ? We do it your way . Full-on sprint to the portal . If we beat Clu there , we have a chance . Let 's get her out of here . This 'll take us there . - ls she goanna make it ? - l don 't know . I 've got to identify the damaged code . The sequencing is just enormously complex . - SAM : But didn 't you write it ? - Some of it . The rest of it is just beyond me . She 's an iso . Kevin : Yeah . The last iso . SAM : All this time , you were just protecting her . Kevin : She 's the miracle , man . Everything I ever worked for . " A digital frontier to reshape the human condition . " SAM : I always thought that was just a plug line . Kevin : in our world , she could change everything . Yeah . Check that out . She risked herself for me . Some things are worth the risk . Kevin : Look at this . Now , that is impressive if I do say so myself . Huh ? Come on , it 's goanna take a while for her system to reboot . Now it 's time for you to tell me a story . CLU : The boy and Flynn are gone . CASTOR : I presume , Your Excellency , they perished in the elevator . You presume ? Find them . SAM : icecaps are melting , war in the Middle East , LakerslCeltics back at it . I don 't know . Rich are getting richer , poor are getting poorer . Cell phones , online dating , Wi-Fi . - Kevin : What 's Wi-Fi ? - Wireless interlinking . - Of digital devices ? - Yeah . Hmm. I thought of that in ' 85 . Mom and Dad are ... - l assume that ... - Yeah . Oh . Mac when I was 1 2 and Gram five years later . You remember that night when you didn 't come home ? - Well ... - You said ... I said I 'd show you the Grid . You should have seen this place back then . I couldn 't wait to show it to you . Could not wait . SAM : Must have been something before Clu screwed it up . No , no , he ... He 's me. I screwed it up . Chasing after perfection . Chasing after what was right in front of me . Right in front of me . Look what you 've accomplished . it 's incredible . Sam , I 'd have given it all up for one more day with you . Hey . Remember your old Ducati ? You kidding ? Not a day goes by I don 't think about that bike . - Yeah , well , I 'm fixing her up . - You busted my bike ? Twenty years in the shed , no tarp . I mean , she needed a little love . How does she run ? Well , when I 'm done , better than ever . Well , man , I 'd like to see that . You will . Here . She 's rebooting . Give her this . The old man 's goanna knock on the sky , listen to the sound . CASTOR : When Flynn entered the space , ah , everything changed . I 've never seen anything quite like it . The awe was palpable . - Was it ? - l presume our understanding is still valid ? Control of the city ? A sizeable request , I know . But seemingly fitting compensation . Don 't you think ? How long have you been searching for this , Clu ? About 1 , 000 cycles . No ? Just imagine the secrets it holds . The master key to any and all riddles of the Grid , Grid , Grid , Grid ... But there 's something else , too . isn 't there ? I 've heard the chatter about this private initiative . I realize that our alliance is , at times , uneasy . But always necessary . You know you need me right where l am . Clu ? Of course you 're right . Enjoy the drink . End of line , man . - Hey. it 's okay . We 're safe for now . We 're heading east towards the portal . Clu has the disk . Once I get out , I can shut him down . I should never have sent you to Zuse . it was a mistake . it 's okay. I 've made a few myself . Where is he ? SAM : I think he 's knocking on the sky . QUORRA : And listening to the sound . Yeah . How did you find him ? it 's okay . I know . QUORRA : it was during the Purge . Clu was relentless . The Black Guard were executing lSOs in the streets . Everyone I knew disappeared . Then they came for me . So I ran . A sympathetic program smuggled me out of the city . But soon they had me surrounded . I prepared for the end . And just as everything was going dark , I felt a hand on my shoulder . And when I opened my eyes , standing above me was the Creator . Your father . He saved me . I guess you could say I 'm a rescue . SAM : Hell of a view . QUORRA : it used to let us know that Flynn was here . it became the symbol of something bigger , something better than this world . I 've never been this close before . it 's how I imagine a sunrise to be . Ah , trust me . There 's no comparison . What 's it like ? - The sun ? - Yeah . Man ... I 've never had to describe it before . Warm . Radiant . Beautiful . Get below ! Move ! This isn 't supposed to be here . - What happened ? - A new course . What is this ? Clu can 't create programs . He can only destroy or repurpose them . Repurpose them for what ? COMPUTER : Battalion 6 , report to Staging Area Alpha . He 's building an army . Let 's go . COMPUTER : All high-level functions , report immediately to combat stations . - Goodbye . - Quorra ! - What 's she doing ? - Removing herself from the equation . Tron . Kevin : He 's alive . COMPUTER : Throne ship is approaching . - We can 't just let her go . - No , Sam , there 's another way . Throne ship is approaching . Jarvis : Well done , sir . Jarvis : I 've never seen anything like it . Humbly , sir , I know you have greater designs than any of us understand . What does it do ? She 's goanna wind up like one of them . Keep moving , Sam . You are a very rare bird , aren 't you , now ? Where 's your disk ? Where is he ? it must have been so lonely out there . How tragic to be the only one . I 've seen what users are capable of , Clu . You don 't belong with them . I have something very special in mind for you . Take her upstairs . And find them . You 'll have to excuse me . You arrived just as I was preparing a little toast . - Greetings , programs ! Together we have achieved a great many things . We have created a vast , complex system . We 've maintained it .

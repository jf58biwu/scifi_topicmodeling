 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be , Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , Inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . ( shouts , grunts ) Thanks again for letting me crash here . My husband isn 't here , But he 'll turn up . You 'll see , barbie . ( shouts ) ( gunshot ) That thing is never going to go away . ( gunshots , bullets ricocheting ) Oh , no . No . ( door opens ) ( door closes ) ( footsteps approaching ) Morning . Morning . Feeling okay ? Yeah , it 's just a headache . I get them sometimes when I 'm stressed . Yeah , you took the last one . Dee 's pharmacy is closed . Maybe the gas station has aspirin . You know this town pretty well For someone who 's just passing through . Dee 's is not really a hard name to remember . Think I 'll go over to the radio station . All right , well , I 'll catch a ride with you . ( over bullhorn ) : All right , everybody , orders are in . Pack it up , we 're out of here . Man : Hey , you can 't leave ! ( overlapping shouting ) Back away , ollie , back away . This thing can really hurt you . Ollie : Why is the military leaving ? The military is supposed to protect us . Linda : Everybody , listen ! I understand that you 're angry , But I 'm gonna ask you to disperse . ( overlapping shouting ) Now ! You weep for mercy When you 've lived lives of wickedness and pride . God does not hear you . He is the master , And you will bend to his will . Go home , this is not helping . " there they cry , " but none giveth answer because of the pride Of evil men . " This dome is his wish For a new eden . What the hell 's going on ? Military 's leaving . It 's been three days and no answers . Folks are getting scared . You think pulling a gun is gonna reassure ' em ? All right , all right , I don 't blame you for wanting answers . We all want to know when this thing is coming down , But this is not helping . Ollie : Government 's left us here to rot . You 're a councilman , rennie . Why should we trust you ? Because they 're out there , ollie , and I 'm in here . Now please listen to the sheriff . Soon as we know what 's going on out there , so will you . Go on home . ( sighs ) You almost lost ' em . What are you gonna do- - open fire on the crowd ? Linda ? Whoa , excuse me . Is she all right ? You okay ? Let 's get out of here . Let 's get her to a car . ( grunting ) ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Brought you some comfortable clothes . And a surprise . ( sniffs ) hmm . You wore this the first time we danced . Junior prom . You were so beautiful . You want me to look beautiful ? I don 't mind . You 're starting to act like the old angle I knew Before the dome came down . Turn around . Turn around . I think you 're getting better . With trust and a little patience , I 'll get her back . Right , ange ? Ange ? ( screams ) ( both grunting ) Junior , I 'm sorry . No , you 're not . No , I 'm sorry . I should have known . You 're not better . ( gasps ) you 're just pretending . Junior , please let me out . I won 't tell anyone . I will forget everything . Please , I will forget about everything . Just ... Just let me out . You can leave whenever you 're ready . ( door opens ) But not before . Can I help you ? Uh , I 'm julia shumway , I 'm the editor of the weekly ... You 're the lady that 's been doing the news on the radio . That why you 're looking for phil ? Phil ? Phil bushey , The dj you work with at the station . That 's his car ; he 's got to be home . That 's my husband 's car . Phil ! ( sighs ) What is all the racket ? What are you doing with peter 's car ? He sold it to me . Oh . I feel like crap . Phil . I need some help ! One seizure happens , maybe it 's no big deal . Two seizures in three days buys you both a full workup . Mom , I feel fine . Yeah , me , too . I know , but we have to be sure . Excuse me , I 'm a physician . We may be dealing with something infectious That 's causing seizures in both of them . I want you to do a blood count , an eeg , And if they 're negative , get them mris . We can do the blood and eeg here , But the closest mri is at the big hospital in westlake , And that 's five miles outside of the dome . I don 't suppose you have a neurologist . We 're fresh out of doctors . Look , one of them 's on vacation in vail , The other one drove his porsche right into the dome , Then I 'll do the tests . What kind of doctor are you ? She 's a psychiatrist , But she did her internship in medicine . Come with me . Your moms are pretty hard-core . You have no idea . All right , I 'll be right there , okay ? Hey , junior , You haven 't seen my sister , have you ? I haven 't seen her since the dome came down . Angie ? Saw her a couple nights ago . Where ? I don 't know , around . Anything else , little man ? I guess not . ( barbie and big jim grunt ) She collapsed and now she 's burning up . Junior : Dad . Junior , what happened to your hand ? Oh , uh , chopping wood . Ax slipped . Feeling okay ? What happened with linda ? I don 't know . Nurse : We need some help . More people are coming in with fever and headache . Big jim : What are we dealing with here ? I don 't know , it could be the flu . We need to get more cots up from the basement . I 'll get it . Junior , help barbie . He passed out . Nurse : Put him in bay 3 . What happened to linda ? Probably from the same thing that happened to phil . I wish I could tell you , mrs . Shumway . The town 's out of doctors . Sure could use your husband . ( panting ) Help ! Help ! Help ! ( screams ) Ow ! Sweetheart , keep still . Oh , you suck at this . No wonder you became a shrink . There , done . Will you run this to the lab ? Sure . So , how 's this thing work ? It measures the electronic activity In your brain . Nope , you 're a mutant like wolverine . You know x-men ? I know a lot of stuff . ( both laugh ) Norrie , not now . Your brain 's as normal As any eeg I 've ever seen . Then why 'd we have the seizures ? Alice , nurse adams said you 'd be here . We need your help , right away . Stay . I know this , uh , may sound crazy , But , uh , we 're lucky you got trapped Here in chester 's mill . Woman : Excuse me . ( coughing , indistinct chatter ) What 's going on ? You tell me . We need your help . Uh , well , I 'll need a mask and gloves before I examine anyone . We 're out of both . What about antibiotics ? Woman : Alice is gonna take your temperature . Man : Okay . What are you doing here ? Linda got sick , so jim and I brought her in . Why ? What are you doing here ? I just brought in a friend of yours- - phil bushey . Go on up ahead ; I 'll , uh ... I 'll catch up with you . If you 've never been to chester 's mill before , How do you know phil ? ( chuckles ) I have no idea what you 're talking about . You lied to me about having a fight with junior rennie , So , yeah , I thought I would check up On maybe what else you lied about . ( panting ) : You owe me an explanation . Barbie , just tell me the truth . Whoa , whoa . I 'm okay , I just have a headache . Let 's get her to the treatment area . Set those cots up down there ; we are getting slammed . Mrs. Moore ? Linda esquivel . You were my third grade teacher . Of course . I remember you , linda . You were an amazing teacher . Oh . You were a terrible student . ( chuckles ) Do you think it 's the dome ? Is that what 's making us sick ? I don 't know , mrs . Moore . I don 't know . Dad , what the hell is going on around here ? ( sighs ) uh , some kind of outbreak . Doctor ... What exactly is going on here ? I think it could be Meningitis . My cousin had that . It 's bad . One minute he was fine , the next he was dying . We can 't be sure , Because the clinic doesn 't have any spinal tap kits , But the symptoms- - high fever , neck pain , Photophobia- - I 'd be surprised if it was anything else . I think we may have an epidemic on our hands . An epidemic ? How contagious is it ? Very . If anyone who 's sick coughs , ( snaps fingers ) it spreads . This damn dome . It 's like an incubator . Your son probably got vaccinated When he went to college ; so did my family . So , we 're okay . Yeah , I got mine in the military . Yeah . Well , what about those who didn 't ? Well , if there 's no symptoms , Swallow an antibiotic and you 're protected . But for these people who are sick , They need antibiotics , and they need them fast . Okay , so then how much time are we talking about ? 11 , maybe 12 hours . I checked- - we don 't have enough antibiotics To treat all these people . Dee 's pharmacy . Listen , doctor . Give me a list of what you need . Let me be absolutely clear : If these people leave and it spreads ... Well , we 're gonna make sure it doesn 't . Got that list from the doctor . Thanks . Go inside . Guard the door . Make sure no one gets out . Like a quarantine ? You can call it what you 'd like . Nobody leaves . Counting on you , junior . The clinic is now closed . No one leaves , you understand ? ( crowd murmuring ) No one . ( gasps ) ( sputters ) ( panting ) ( whimpering ) ( screaming ) ( p.A. Beeping ) Phil ? What ? Phil , I need to know how you ended up with peter 's car . Peter , I 'm sorry , man , I can 't make it to the cabin tonight . Cabin ? What cabin ? What are you doing out of bed ? I think that he knows where peter is . Uh , where my husband is . I just need to talk to him . Well , okay , give him a few hours For his antibiotics to kick in . And you should go back to bed Until big jim comes back with your dose . Dodee , don 't go . He 's hallucinating . It 's one of the later symptoms of meningitis . That you brought him in when you did . Go back to bed . Big jim : What the hell ? Damn it ! Whoever did this took everything . How many are we up to ? At least 30 with advanced symptoms . Another two dozen with early signs . Any news from big jim ? Not yet . Honey , you don 't look well . Are you sure you haven 't caught ... We got vaccinated , remember ? When we took that safari to africa . I took my insulin without eating . How much do you have left ? Can we please talk about this later ? How much ? Definitely a few days ' worth . Okay . I 'm gonna get you something to eat , And you 're gonna eat it . ( sighs ) Woman : Dr. Calvert ! ( monitor beeping rapidly , linda shivering ) Linda 's temp 's 104 and mrs . Moore 's bp 's falling . How much antibiotic do we have left ? One dose . ( beeping continues ) Moore : Give linda the medicine . I 'll wait till the next round . There 's no way I 'm gonna take it . Go ahead , give linda the dose . ( shivering ) ( siren wailing ) Man ( over radio ) : Uh , medical , This is rescue one . You need to let me out . Sorry . Orders from my dad . Nobody leaves until we get this thing under control . Junior ? James ? You don 't understand . I think that my husband might be in trouble . How ? ( people coughing in distance ) What ... ( sighs ) All I know is that Phil said that he was meeting peter in a cabin . Like the one I found barbie at ? What are you talking about ? A few days ago , I followed barbie to this cabin . Uh , end of sparrow 's lane . You need to let me out . I wish I could , but ... I can 't . ( sign buzzing ) ( monitor beeping ) ( scanner beeps ) Barbie : Well , at least whoever took all that medicine Couldn 't have gotten far . Because of the dome ? Yeah . And with a haul that size , There 's no way they 're getting away on foot . So we 're looking for a truck or a van . Or a hearse . What , your reverend ? The hell would he be doing with drugs ? Nothing good . His wrath burns like fire . The hell are you doing ? Honoring his plan . When I heard folks got sick , I broke into dee 's pharmacy ... What are you , insane ? ! People will die without that medicine ! Those people are supposed to die . It 's god 's plan . Trust me . Who lives and dies under his dome . And there 's nothing you can do about it . Unload the car . ( monitor beeping steadily ) ( groans softly ) ( sighs ) What 's happening ? They gave you antibiotics . You should be on the mend soon . And how are you feeling ? I 've been better . If you told me yesterday That the idea of junior rennie Brandishing a shotgun would be reassuring ... ( chuckles ) ... I 'd have laughed my head off . Actually , I might have said that about you A few years ago . Wasn 't exactly the teacher 's pet , was I ? With that mouth of yours ? ( chuckles ) lord , no . But now look at you . The town sheriff . I 've had a lot of help , though . Especially from duke perkins . May he rest in peace . But don 't sell yourself short . ( exhales softly ) Mrs. Moore ? ( monitor flatlines ) Mrs. Moore ? Help ! We need help in here ! She 's coding . Starting chest compressions . One , two , Three , four , five , six , seven , eight , Nine , ten , 11 , 12 ... I was just talking to her . ( door creaks ) ( indistinct chatter ) Ollie : Out of the way , junior ! Man : You have no right to keep us here . Ollie : You can 't stop all of us with that gun . Step back . Woman : Whoa ! Man : Hey , hey , hey . ( chair clatters ) Let 's go . ( gunshot ) ( clamoring ) Junior . ( panting ) Mr. Densmore ... You remember when my mother died ? And your wife , she made that amazing Corn bread . From your own field , she said . Even gave me the skillet . I remember . Now I 'm in here ... With you , with this . Not to point a gun at you . But because I live here And I 'm one of you . We 've got to fight through this thing together And trust that we 're all in here for a reason . I believe in this town . I believe in my dad . And I believe in you . ( door closes ) ( drawer squeaks ) ( quietly ) : Oh , peter . ( exhales ) ( panting ) ( camera clicking ) This is all I could scrounge up . It 's a zoo out there . Thanks . So what are we gonna do when we run out of , like , peanut butter And jelly and bread ? What are we gonna eat ? We 'll get out before then . All right , so , I was thinking ... Our seizures . The last time one happened was after we touched . Yeah , could 've been a coincidence . Both of us ? At the same exact time ? ( chuckles ) What if we triggered it ? Okay , how would that happen ? I don 't know , but ... We should test it . Like ... Touch again ? Yeah . Unless , you know , you 're scared . No , I 'm not scared . We should film it . Here . Get on the floor . All right . But if you pee your pants , Just know there will be video evidence . Joe : Same goes for you . ( sighs ) You ready ? Let 's do it . Okay . I feel stupid . ( electrical crackle ) ( horn honking ) Got the antibiotics . Man : Bring it straight on in to the charge nurse . Any problems in there ? Not at all . ( shouts ) ( crying ) Help ! Junior ! ( panting ) So , where 's julia ? Not a clue , man . I barely know where I am . ( quietly ) : What did you tell her ? ( exhales ) What did she ask you ? It 's all kind of blurry , But I think it was something about her husband . Relax , it 's not like He 's gonna say anything about you . He 's gone . What do you mean , he 's gone ? Gone like gone . Like " adios , peter shumway . " ( grunts ) ( exhales , sighs ) About a month ago , he came to me asking if I knew any hit men . Whoa ... He asked you about hit men ? I know . Right ? And I told him that crap was only in the movies . He was in a bad way . He sold me his car for a steal . I told him if things were that bad , he should Take the cash and buy the first bus ticket out of here And start over . Sorry , man . I don 't know how much he owed you . ( chuckles ) You ain 't getting that cash back . And how much of this did you tell her ? It 's tough to say . I ... I was pretty out of it . ( pats shoulder ) Peter ? ( panting ) Hey there , red . ( panting ) Why didn 't you tell me ? I 'll tell you soon . Norrie . Wake up . You feel anything ? I don 't remember . Let 's check out the video . I 'll rewind it . ( beeping ) Here we go . Norrie : Okay . I feel stupid . ( electrical crackle ) Both : The pink stars are falling . The pink stars are falling in lines . Pink stars ? I don 't get it . Shh ... Do you remember doing that ? No . No way . What does this mean ? I don 't know . Maybe we 're not supposed to tell anyone . Why not ? Joe : Norrie . Wake up . 'cause the dome doesn 't want us to . Norrie : What happened ? Joe : You feel anything ? Hey . Have you seen julia ? Junior : Why ? Did she wise up and ditch you ? When 's the last time you saw her ? Couple hours ago . She kept asking about a cabin . What 'd you tell her ? I just mentioned the place I saw you a couple days ago . Give me the keys to your truck . No . Hey . Now , she left on your watch . She 's sick and she will die out there , So give me the keys to your truck . Peter ... ( panting ) ( shivering ) All right . You were a brave little girl back there . Okay . Get home and get better . She 's good . Oh . Well , well , well . Look who came back from the dead . I heard you saved the day . Well , that 's what I do . Well , your son takes after you , too . Oh , yeah ? He stopped what could have been a full-blown riot . People were freaking out , and he talked them down . Chip off the old block . You ever consider a career in law enforcement ? Was that you ? Was that me what ? Was that you who saved my life ? I learned about peter in that cabin . We 're broke ; he emptied our accounts . And the house is in foreclosure . So , what were you all into ? Drugs ? ( chuckles softly ) When I got out of the military , I did , um ... I had a bunch of odd jobs . Uh ... Was a line cook . Construction . ( sighs ) And then , um ... Then I linked up with a bookie ... Out of westlake . Taking bets ? Making sure the people paid what they owed . You 're an enforcer . Guys like phil owed ... And they paid up , And most of the time , it 's like that . Peter never gambled . Peter ( recorded ) : I 've got the cash , but my wife 's home . Meet me at the other spot . It 's his voice mail from five days ago . So , where is he now ? Please . I have to know . He must have taken off . You know , that happens sometimes . Some of these guys , they get in so deep , and ... You know , they skip town . I 'm sorry . You 're sorry ? I let you stay in my house . I trusted you . Your sorry means nothing to me . When I get back home , you better be gone . Norrie : So , is the outbreak over ? Well , everyone who 's sick has been treated , And anyone exposed to meningitis ... Got antibiotics . So yes , it 's over . How do you guys feel ? Any more seizures ? No . We 're fine . What have you two been doing all day ? Oh , you know , just making out and stuff . Alice : Right . It 's the " stuff " that usually worries us . ( sighs ) I am beat . Can we go home , please ? Norrie : Home ? It 's a room above a diner . You have any better ideas , kiddo ? Well , I do . I mean , both my parents are outside the dome , And there 's more than enough room at my house . It 's just me , so ... You guys could stay there . Please don 't say no . Please ? Thanks , joe . That 'd be great . Carolyn : I 'll grab our stuff and meet you in the car . ♪ Babe , what are you doing ? Are you stealing insulin ? You yourself said you only had a week 's supply left . Alice , look what happened today . We almost ran out of antibiotics for everyone . What happens when we run out ? Okay , what 's going on ? You 're not acting like yourself . I-I 'm scared . What if the dome lasts forever ? It won 't . We will get out of here . Soon . I promise . You sure you 'll be okay ? Yeah . Thanks for the ride . Yeah . ( sighs ) it 's not your fault , you know . What isn 't ? Mrs. Moore . She died saving my life . She knew how important you are to this town . To all of us . I 'm not the only one . What you did today saved a lot of lives . The way you did it . Duke always said The greatest weapon we have as police Is a good heart . Mrs. Moore was right . About what ? We havcome a long way . ( quiet creaking ) ( doorknob rattles ) ( quiet creaking continues ) If you came here to apologize , Don 't bother . I have nothing to apologize for . I came ... To give you this . My share of the profits . Keep all the propane . I 'm gonna wash my hands of our dirty little business . ( laughs ) Little late for that , lester . Never too late to repent . You think you 've saved this town , But you 've damned them . You defied god 's will . And for that , you 'll pay . You 're lucky I didn 't haul your ass into jail For what you did today . Luck has nothing to do with it . You can 't hurt me without hurting yourself . God bless . ( door creaks ) ( shivering ) ( panting ) ( gasps ) ( grunts ) ( gasps ) Help ! ( sobbing ) : Help ... ! Help !

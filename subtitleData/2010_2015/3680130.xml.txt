 Oh , my God . Come quick ! It 's your sister Annabelle ! I want to come home . Taking Annabelle ... That was never part of the deal . You asked me to give you data to tell you when we were running the experiment . - That 's all . - The deal is whatever we say it is . Annabelle is just insurance . - What 's that on his hand ? - That looks like a ring . A quantum entanglement device . I 'm Gabriel McDow . I told you that . I definitely said that already . - You have to remember things . - Why have you been following me ? You 're going the wrong way . The futures I saw , you 're always with Lloyd . You all know Fiona Banks , MI-6 . None of them had visions , and now they 're all dead . " The blue hand . No limits . No fear . " - A death club ? - Slingerland . Am I saying that right ? It says here you taught American history at South Fairfax high . This conversation has already been written . Whatever you 've all seen is gonna happen . Now Celia 's death was an accident . It could 've happened to anyone . What I saw doesn 't have to play out that way . I found a way to change the game . You do realize you 're wearing the same jacket you were wearing when we broke ground on the accelerator . It was an accident , I suppose . There are no accidents , Lloyd . I detect some sublimated sentiment bubbling to the surface . This is a big deal for both of us . We 've been working on tachyons for 12 years . This is our moment , Simon . Go with it . Cheers . Cheers . God , I hope it all works . We 're simulating the big bang . What could go wrong ? - Excuse me . - Sure . Sure . It 's mum . Hello . What ? When ? Is Annabelle all right ? Just tell her I 'll be on the first flight home . Okay , you , too . Bye . My dad died . Activation in one minute . All right . This experience was designed by Dr. Campos , who , unfortunately , could not be with us on this day when we recreate the beginning of the universe . Lloyd Simcoe , Dr. Campos ' mentor , the brain behind the brain . This is Angie Tremont from the " new science report . " A journalist ? It 's all right . She 's been cleared . Sorry . We have a rather strict confidentiality protocol , so we 're a little wary of the press . It 's a pleasure to meet you , Dr. Simcoe . Dr. Myhill 's been telling me all about the project . Your crowning glory . It 's been a team effort . Gordon , the preliminary firings have started . The big moment . Yes ? They 're ready . - Activation commencing in 30 seconds . - Initiate . Here goes nothing . Or everything . Activation commencing in 20 seconds . Activation commencing in 10 seconds ... The visions people had are really only just possible futures . The universe operates within certain parameters , but there is some flexibility . With one week till the 29th , Dr. Simcoe , we are all still wondering what to expect . It 's a well-known precept in quantum physics that observations shape reality . You 're saying that seeing our futures may , in fact , change our futures . That 's the theory , yes . But the future does have a way of fighting back . What do you mean by that ? Small things may change , but the forces of the universe may be pushing us towards the futures we have seen . That 's interesting . And what about the people who learned they were meant to die before the 29th but lived past the fatal event ? Those people are the statistical anomalies at the edge of the curve . Should you still be worried ? Because it sounds like you 're saying the universe may course-correct , that they might not have escaped their fates after all . Yes , that 's possible . So maybe a better word for " course-correction " is " destiny " ? I 'm just a scientist , I 'm not really qualified to answer that question . I 'd like to welcome tonight 's next guest , Celia Quinones . Ms. Quinones is the young woman whose future was changed by the suicide of FBI Agent Al Gough , one of Dr. Simcoe 's " statistical anomalies . " Ms. Quinones , take us through your experience . First , I would like to say again to the family of Agent Gough how grateful my family and I are for his actions . In the first weeks after the blackout , I heard that not having a vision meant that I would be dead on April 29th . That must 've been terrifying for you . When I discovered on the mosaic Web site that I would be hit by a car , I lived in constant terror - that I might die at any moment . - But you didn 't . I 'm sure a lot of people have questions , so let 's open up the phone lines . Muncie , Indiana , you 're on the air . This question 's for Dr. Simcoe . Is it possible the blackout caused permanent brain damage to anyone ? There 's no reason to believe so . People 's lives have been ruined . What if this happens again ? It is critical that people remain calm . And I must repeat that ... no one 's brain was damaged in any way by the blackout itself . And let me reassure you it is impossible ... that there could be another blackout . I almost believe him myself . Tell me again why we 're not telling people there 's another blackout coming ? We don 't know when it 's gonna happen . We tell people but don 't say when ? The world will turn into an armed camp . So , Celia , you 're confident that your future has changed ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . Thank you for joining us today . Any last words , Dr. Simcoe ? Come the 29th , I believe that we will end up where we 're supposed to be . " Supposed to be " ? That doesn 't mean we can 't decide our fate . After the break , we 'll be talking to * * * ... author of the award-winning book " Teens and truth . " She 's going to help us figure how to talk about ... Stop ! Stop ! That 's my sister ! Stop there ! Stop , Simon ! Don 't come any closer or they 'll kill me ! - Who ? - They 're watching . They 'll shoot me . What ? What ? Who ? - What do they want ? - They said they want you and the ring . They got your message , and they 're sending one back . You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . Please , Simon . Give them what they want . They were very specific . You only have 12 hours to give them the ring or they will kill me . Get in the car . Just go . - Annabelle , I 'm not leaving you here . - Get in the car . Just go ! Please , just go ! Let 's go . Now . - = Blackout Team = - Saison 1 - Ã‰pisode 19 - = Course Correction = - Zampieron ? Tech wizard extraordinaire ? I 'll take that as a " yes " . - License plate ? - You are good . What I 'd like to know is whose car that belongs to . Yeah , I can definitely do this . Simple . Just gotta run it by the head man . That 's the part of the process I 'd like you to omit . No can do . Name your price . Anything ? How do you always know when I 'm here ? Stalking . Internet . Paid informants . You know , the usual . I brought you a book . It 's one of my favorites , and it helped me a lot with my mom . I wish ... I wish you 'd tell me when you 're getting chemo . I don 't want you to feel obligated to come . It 's not an obligation . LAPD called . Someone claiming to be MI6 used my name to get access to a crime scene . Hello , Demetri . - You 're looking well . - You too , Fiona . I 'm guessing you didn 't fly all the way in from London just ' cause you missed me . Andrew Weeks was supposed to die on march the 2nd from a drug allergy , but he survived the date . He made a big deal out of it too , huh ? His wife heard him fall , came running out and found him dead . No sign of anyone coming in or out the house . If I 'm living on borrowed time , I might avoid a room full of guns . Except he wasn 't shot . He was bleeding from the mouth and nose , so forensics field-tested his coffee . - It showed positive for warfarin . - Rat poison ? That explains the bleeding . I don 't get it . You got a room full of guns , and you poison a guy . Why ? Weeks was supposed to die from a drug allergy , not a gunshot wound . The killer was trying to get as close as possible to the original cause of death . That was in his papers . These are directions to a blue hand gathering . That 's why I 'm here . Four blue handers dead in the L.A. area in the last three weeks . Each knew exactly how and when they were supposed to die but lived past their death date . I was in Anaheim investigating when I got word of this one . You really think someone 's trying to knock off survivors ? It 's just a hunch . What was I supposed to say ? " Yes , there 's gonna be another blackout . Sorry , we just can 't tell you when . " So you said what you had to . I mean , people are terrified . You gave ' em hope . No , what I gave them was a lie . What would give people hope is if Simon and I could crack this QED technology . Then at least people wouldn 't black out in the first place . What about that caller who asked about brain damage ? I mean , I 've never even considered that . No . If the blackout could cause brain damage , we would 've picked up on it a long time ago . I know how much this is weighing on you . I wish there was something I could do to help . You already are . You wanted to see me ? You may think that promising a junior analyst a weekend at the bunny ranch will get him to jeopardize his job , but it won 't . My sister ran away from home after the blackout I saw her this morning . She was in a white van with that license plate . So you just figured you 'd have one of my agents help you out ? I have to find her . We ran the plate . Van was stolen two days ago in San Francisco . Traffic cam ... picked this up . Now that 's a nice story , Simon , but how about the truth ? You wanna tell me what the hell 's going on ? I was trying to have her come with me . The people she 's with , they have some sort of hold over her . You 're lying . She didn 't run away . She was kidnapped . Look at her body language . She 's terrified . - How long have you known ? - What are you talking about ? Don 't play games with me . This is your sister . Exactly . My sister . That 's why I 'll do anything to find her . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Someone knows you feel this way , they 'll use it against you as leverage . And considering what you know , I 'd say they could get a lot . Are you suggesting I 've been compromised ? I don 't know what you 've been , but I do know one thing : you 've been lying . And now you 've put the entire mosaic investigation in jeopardy . What do you think ? Something in the ring 's structure has to be maintaining superposition . It 's keeping people awake , but how ? You 're not listening . " Maintaining superposition " was what you said , and I have no idea . Do you want to focus a little ? We 've done enough damage . Maybe we can put something right . Look , just because you feel guilty about lying on the news and want to save the world doesn 't mean that we can actually make it happen . Yes , we can , and it 's not about feeling guilty . No , it 's about preventing more deaths . It 's all Lloyd Simcoe 's fault , and now he can save the day . It 's a little messianic , don 't you think ? What are you talking about ? Millions of deaths . It 's an overwhelming concept . Numbers like that , you lose track of individuals . They fall through the cracks . - A single person doesn 't even matter . - Now you 're losing me . My sister . Annabelle ? So what are you talking about ? She 's been kidnapped . - When ? - A few days after the blackout . Why would anyone kidnap your sister ? - I have no idea . - What do the police say ? The FBI are on it . There 's nothing more I can do . Why didn 't you tell me ? I would 've helped . Oh , yeah ? How ? I don 't know , but ... now I just feel useless . It 's not about you . I had to deal with the situation as best I could for Annabelle . Now I 'm sorry I didn 't keep you in the loop . I 've been kinda busy . Why would he hide the fact that his sister was kidnapped ? The polygraph 's inconclusive . You really think he 's compromised ? There 's nothing concrete , but ... I don 't like this situation any more than you do , but we need Simon . We 'll look for his sister . Find her , and find out what they want from him . I never thought we 'd be talking to this guy again . Everyone , next week 's reading Schopenhauer . Mr. Slingerland ? Agent Noh . I 'm so glad to see you again . This is inspector Banks . - I remember you , too . - Mr. Slingerland . What 's going on ? Do you recognize this man ? That 's Andrew . Andy Weeks . I remember seeing him at the blue hand gatherings . That was a while ago . I 'm not really into that anymore . - Why do you ask ? - He 's dead . How ? Murdered . Poor Andy . Guess he thought he was in the clear . But I suppose the universe has to , balance itself . Excuse me ? Life is energy , you see . As each new life begins , another ends . And if you mess with that balance , the universe pushes back . Andy was a good guy . I 'm sorry . We need you to put together a list of the blue handers who knew Mr. Weeks . - Can you do that for us ? - Be happy to . And you might want to be careful . We think someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates people like you . So you don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? Just watch you back , is what we 're saying . I will , agent Noh . Gabriel 's blood work came back . So besides his feet , everything seems okay . The left foot looks good . His right still looks pretty bad . Okay , well , let 's finish up the antibiotics , and we 'll reevaluate tomorrow . Orderlies to admitting . Where 's Charlie ? Hey , you ! Charlie 's at school . What are you doing here ? Occupational therapy , which I completely forgot about . Dylan was hoping to see you , and ... so was I. I knew it . I saw it would happen . - I knew it . - Pardon ? You 're supposed to be with Olivia . Not the an other one . Gabriel , let 's go . Come on . Back to bed . - My shoes . - Your shoes didn 't fit . - Your feet were bleeding . - I liked those shoes . We 'll get you some more shoes . We will . Let 's go . Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree I 'll explain later . - Let 's go ? - Okay . Let 's go . Inside . Gabe , we 're gonna do this . Let 's go . So good . So good that you 're together with Lloyd now . - No , we 're not together . - You are now . It 's so good . You know what ? We 're not , we 're not together , Gabe . We 're just ... That 's complicated . We 're ... You 're the best thing since sliced bread . Yes ? - The best thing since sliced bread . - In you go . Can I come in ? Brought lunch . Hi , Gabriel . - Where 's the beef ? - Right here . Go ahead . So how 's he doing ? - He 's better . - Good . We got a lot of questions , I 'm gonna have to bring him into the FBI . He hasn 't finished his IV antibiotics . He needs a brain scan . He 's not going anywhere for a few days . Would it be all right if I just ask him a few questions here , then ? Sure . Can I ask you a question ? I found this in your things . You wanna tell me what this is ? My book . It 's all there . But what is this a picture of ? Gabriel , this is important . I saw it . I was there , on a trip . I saw it . A flash-forward . - I don 't like pickles ! - Okay , it 's okay . I don 't like lettuce ! I hate onions ! I ... I like tomatoes . Now where are we ? Starting from where we first pick up the van Campos ' sister was in , 6th street bridge . Then we headed South . We picked them up here , and then here , they head into this weird zone downtown . Eight blocks wide . Coverage their is sketchy , we lost them . - You can 't get me any more than that ? - I 'm not a magician . Any way we can pick up the van coming out of that zone ? There are over a hundred exits . It 'd take at least a day and a half - to go through . - It 's only eight blocks . We can do a sweep in less time than whiz kid here - You found something . - Just following up on a tip . - I 'm coming with you . - No . - Yes , I am . - No , you 're not ! Listen to me , Simon . You 're here for one reason and one reason only ... to work on the QED . Your volunteering here is starting to feel a little convenient . I don 't trust you , Simon . Not for a minute . - That 's your prerogative . - You 're damn right , and that 's not gonna work out too well for you . Right now I 'm gonna go get your sister back . And after I do , you and I are gonna have a little sit-down . No more lying . They want you and the ring . They got your message , they 're sending one back . You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . Please , Simon . Give them what they want . Thanks for coming by . I wanted to go over your latest serologies with you . Your tumor markers are undetectable . Lymphocytes are back to normal . Wait . - Does that mean that I 'm ... - Experimentation seems to be working . Your cancer is officially in remission . What ? We 've been optimistic for a few weeks . I didn 't want to get your hopes up . I 've had two other oncologists check those results , and it 's working . That 's incredible . What are you waiting for ? Go on . Get out of here . The future awaits . You wanted to see me ? We have a shift down at immigration tonight giving flu shots to detainees . Can you help out ? Sure . Happy to . Great . Take a look through these files see what you 're getting yourself into . Don 't worry . It 's all basic . Nothing you can 't handle . Have you been working all day ? Since 5 o 'clock in the morning . Do you know this man ? Someone tampered with his coffee . - You 're sure ? - He 's a regular . He 's here every day . - So am I. - When 's the last time you saw him ? Yesterday . He was here with some guy , chatting away like they were old pals . Made a big deal about surviving something , his whole life to look forward to . What 'd his friend look like ? I don 't know . Tall , kinda geeky-looking , wearing this big , ugly horseshoe ring . Life is energy , you see . As each new life begins , another ends . If you mess with that balance , the universe ... - You 're sure ? - Yeah , I am . Pushes back . " You can do " what you will , " but at any given moment of your life , " you can will only one definite thing . " Nothing other than that thing . " What does that means ? That free will is a lie ? Exactly . Where 's Mr. Slingerland ? I don 't know . He was here , and then he just left . Are you Agent Noh ? He wanted me to tell you something . What ? The universe always pushes back . You might want to be careful . Someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates . So you don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . He 's trying to course-correct . I know who he 's going after next . Welcome to your future . Run ! Celia , run ! Now ! Celia ! He 's heading South on grand ! Freeze ! FBI ! She just ran in front of me ! I couldn 't stop ! She 's still alive . EMTs to grand and 6th priority 3 ! Code 1 ! Move ! She was just there . She 's all right . Stay with her ! She 's not dead . She 's alive . You failed . Not yet . Anyway ... It 's not me . It 's the universe , which never fails . It 's funny . I was supposed to have an aneurysm , you killed me instead . Gets done either way . See you soon ... sport . - Simon . - Here to make up for my bad behavior . Don 't worry about it . You 've been under a lot of stress lately . I just wanted to say thanks . For what ? Cambridge , the Brewschlagger fellowship , for getting me into NLAP . I did it for selfish reasons . You make me look good . Gracious as well . You helped me out and you know it . I wouldn 't be anywhere without you . What 's going on ? I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about Annabelle . Truly , I am . I should 've . It 's been eating away at me , and I 've been pretending I was fine . I should have said something . I 'm sorry I couldn 't help . - I would have , you know . - I know you would . You 're my only friend . You are clearly in need of a drink . Come on . You 're not wrong , but I ... I have to be somewhere . I 'll see you , Lloyd . I 've been looking all over for you . What 's the matter ? - I have something I have to tell you . - Me too . - Then . - You 're never gonna believe this . My cancer is in remission . - I know ! - My God ! That 's amazing ! I 'm still completely in shock , and it got me thinking about my future , and I don 't want to waste any more time . Are you sure ? - What we saw is . - No , forget what we saw . We 're here , now . This is all that matters . What happened to Celia ... there was nothing we could do . I 've been thinking about our bird . What if you tape the window ? - How do you mean ? - Well , if you cover the window , the bird might not crash into it . It 's a nice thought . But I think it 'll probably just crash into a different window . Maybe . But it 's worth a shot . It 's the hospital calling . Agent banks ? Agent Fiona banks ? I 'm calling about Celia Quinones and I 'm afraid it 's bad news . Her physical and neurological injuries are extensive , and I 'm not optimistic about her chance of survival . You 're gonna call again on the 29th - to tell me that she 's gone . - Ms. Banks , what happened to Celia was an accident . There are no accidents anymore . Mark , we 're running out of time for Campos ' sister . I 've covered a 5-block radius . Only 3 to go . I 'm sorry . Special Agent Benford . FBI . Looks like they got you working late . Yeah . Some clown ran right into this , nearly took out the electrical box . Pulled into that warehouse driving crazy . That 's a lot of damage . Imagine what the van looked like . Imagine . I think I found the van . Put me through to the SWAT . You 're safe now . I 'm here . It 's mark . We got her . She 's sitting right next to me . Thank God . - Is she all right ? - Exhausted , - confused , but physically she 's fine . - Can I talk to her for a second ? - I just wanna hear her voice . - All right , but then you and I need to talk , and you need to tell me everything . No more lies , Simon . Fine . He wants to talk to you . Belle . Is that really you ? I 'm really tired , Simon . I wanna go home and see mom . I know . I just wanted to make sure you were safe . No matter what happens , baby sister , remember ... I love you . I love you , too . Good-bye , belle . He took the damn ring . What am I looking at ? This is Gabriel McDows brain . No brain damage . And he had hundreds of flash-forwards . These are taken from people who were being scanned at the time of the blackout on October 6th . Same thing . No damage . Nothing unusual . So you weren 't lying about this in your interview . Makes me feel a bit better . Good . So this McDow is a savant ? He 's pretty high-functioning . - Incredible memory . - And he thinks we should be together . That 's what he saw in his flash-forwards . Were we happy ? I know how I felt in mine . I need to talk to you . I was just leaving . Thanks for the scans . I really appreciate it . Yes , sure . Excuse me . - See you later . - Bye , mark . I 'll call you . Simon Campos has disappeared . - What ? - He 's gone . He came to see me tonight . It was the strangest thing . Like he was trying to say good-bye . The day of the blackout , anything about his behavior seem ... strange ? I don 't know . He was in Toronto at his father 's funeral . My dad died . - What happened ? - There was an accident . I have to go home . Yes , of course . Then we 'll postpone until you get back . Stick to the plan . The system 's still on standby . What difference does ? What 's the rush ? No , we 've worked too long , too hard at this . We have to stay on schedule . It has to be October 6th , 11 : 00 AM . No delays . I never understood why he would miss that moment , after all those years of work , we could 've changed the date . Is Simon Campos capable of engineering a global blackout ? He 's capable of anything . And he always has a plan . Once we realized that his involvement in the blackout was deeper than we thought , I went back and I ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on suspect zero . Not only are they comparable in height , weight and age , they 're a 99th percentile match in spacial-temporal and kinematic classes . But suspect zero was in Detroit , and we have multiple eyewitnesses that put Simon at his father 's funeral in Toronto the same day . I checked inbound flights to airports around Detroit . On October 6th , a g4 with Canadian tail numbers requested an emergency maintenance landing at willow run . So they wouldn 't have filed a flight plan . Plane was on the ground for a couple of hours then right back to Toronto . He could 've gotten to the stadium then back to the airport by then . Show me that footage again . Simon Campos is suspect zero . If I showed you pictures , Annabelle , could you identify any of these guys ? We need to find the men who took you . I never saw any faces . They always wore these weird masks . - Please , can I go home now ? - I know you 're tired . Just one more question . What did they want from Simon ? I told you . I don 't know . They just left me in the van . They said they were done with me . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? What did they want him for ? I promise you . Nothing bad will happen to Simon . Think real hard . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? They said he 's going to cause another blackout . - = Blackout Team = -

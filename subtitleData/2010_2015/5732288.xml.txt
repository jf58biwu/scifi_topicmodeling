 Narrator : Previously on helix ... I just sacrificed my own men for you . Now it 's your turn . Run along and find me that cure . Hi . I 'm julia . That 's my name too . And you are ? His sister . The one you left behind when you stole him from his family . Jules . What are you doing here ? I thought you were ... Look at me . ( shrieking ) So , let me get this straight . You just woke up And your symptoms had regressed ? Not regressed , vanished . No lesions , no fever , no black mucus . That 's ... Mmm , god , this is good . It 's unbelievable , I know . It 's like I was never infected in the first place . I hate to be the one to say it , but the virus could Be entering a latent stage , going dormant . Lysogenesis . At first I thought that too , but I feel so good . Are you gonna eat that ? Please , help yourself . Sure hasn 't hurt your appetite at all . So , you 're not feeling any other symptoms ? Alan , for god 's sake , I 'm fine . In fact , I have never felt so good . ( coughing ) ( retching ) Hey . Jules . Jules . Jules . Ahhh ! ( laughing ) ( screeching ) No , no , no , that 's not funny . Not goddamn funny . Oh , I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . I couldn 't resist . ( laughing ) unbelievable . Okay , okay . As soon as I finish this , I 'm gonna get back To the lab , run a full panel of myself . Cbc , coags , viral screen , the works . No , if I developed antibodies that could fight off the virus , It would help the others . I don 't want you anywhere near the lab until we 've confirmed Every trace of this virus is out of your body . Remember bucharest , 2002 . What happened in bucharest ? Meningitis outbreak . Rumor got out that the aid workers were hoarding a vaccine . Crowd stormed the treatment center , nearly killed them . If anyone gets wind of your recovery , They may think we 've come up with a cure . I want you to keep a low profile , Especially with sutton roaming the halls of this base . Sutton ? Hatake warned me about her . He doesn 't trust her either . He said that ? When ? When we were down on level r . He was down there ? With you ? He helped me get back up here . I thought you knew . ( warning tone ) automated voice : Contamination . Sarah , once you 're finished with the collection , get right to the lab . Jules , sit tight . I 'll check back in as soon as I can . I don 't want to lose anyone else today . Alan : What happened ? Vector attack . Anybody hurt ? Infected ? We got lucky . My men chased him down , Cornered him in here . Did they corner him , Or did he lead them in here ? You think he wanted to contaminate the food supply ? Why infect us one by one When they could starve us en masse ? There 's bleach , disinfecting supplies in the airlock . I want you to spray down this entire room After you 've taken everything out in biohazard containers and destroyed it . I don 't want anyone consuming contaminated food stuffs in a panic . Let 's lock down this sector while we sterilize . If anyone asks , it 's routine maintenance . Now that hatake 's been detained , are you still acting on his behalf ? Dr. Hatake is no longer in charge of this base . What about emergency rations ? Hatake must have hidden reserves throughout the base . Go ask him yourself . I 'd better stop or you 'll need a blood transfusion . ( chuckling ) I 'm glad to see you 're in such a good mood , though . We can use some of that around here . I feel better than I have in a long time . Are you experiencing any other symptoms ? Light sensitivity . Bad ? You have no idea . Are you wearing colored contacts ? Can I trust you to keep a secret ? I mean , I 'd say it dies with me , but ... Good enough . Holy . ( theme music playing ) ( door opening ) Constance : I heard the alarm . Is there anything I need to attend to ? Vector got in the food supply . We lost most of the dry goods along with ... A simple yes or no will do . No , ma 'am , it 's under control . Hmm . Perhaps " under control " is not in our best interests . Ma 'am ? Our cdc team is trained to perform under pressure . I may have failed to provide them with the optimal conditions for their success . What would you like me have the men do ? Have them do nothing . Allow the vectors to run free . We 'll see if fear inspires creativity . Anything else ? I 'm good at my job , aren 't I ? Unquestionably . Usually I can Assess any situation , Immediately determine what is important and what is not . I ascribe value , klein . So why can I not find the value in this julia walker ? Speak freely . Can 't be you . Must be the situation . Thank you . And klein ... Automated voice : Code 127 , level g ... This is ridiculous . Why am I dressed up for the nerd prom ? You 're trying to blend in . I need sutton to see me doing her work So we can continue to move around the base freely . What are you looking at ? Stop . What ? Being yourself . I missed you too , miksa . My name 's daniel . Okay . Daniel . So , how is it you never realized that your little playmates Kept disappearing from this place ? Hatake lied to me . Why wouldn 't I believe the man who adopted me ? If you don 't know anything , let 's talk to someone who does . Hatake 's not gonna tell you anything . I 'm not talking about hatake . What did you do ? You 'll have to be more specific . What did you do to julia down on level r ? Do you have a cure ? There is no cure . What happened to dr . Walker was not my doing . I don 't believe you . It doesn 't matter what you believe . Dr. Walker is virus-free , And that puts her in grave danger . From whom ? Sutton ? From sutton . From everyone . And not just at this base . If she is the only person in the world to have beaten the virus ... Then she 'll be experimented on for the rest of her life . Go . Now ! Don 't leave her side . ( knocking on door ) Alan ? Dr. Walker , I presume ? I 'm constance sutton . I 've been so looking forward to meeting you . My , what beautiful eyes you have . What 's going on here ? I want to see dr . Walker ... Nobody in or out . Sutton 's orders . Why ? Talk to sutton . I need walker in the lab ... Talk to sutton . Alan . Hey , what the hell do you think you 're doing ? I need to speak to dr . Walker . Dr. Walker is no longer your concern . She 's now the property of the ilaria corporation . Let me make this easy for you . One option . I will allow you to return to the lab and continue working , Even though I have gotten closer to the cure in the last eight minutes Than you have in the last eight days . As for dr . Walker , Her body contains a proprietary medical therapy belonging to ilaria . You can 't just appropriate a human being . Oh , but I can . She 's mine now . Escort dr . Farragut back to the lab . Do not let him out of your sight . And bring me hatake . Oh , sergio , you 're bleeding . How 'd you get in here ? Daniel : How do you think ? Great . You bring him along to finish the job ? Hey , this wasn 't my idea . I see that . You don 't have your trusty ice axe . Stop it , both of you ! Kill each other later . There 's other lives at stake here . Hatake has to have a list of those kids he stole . And we need your help to get it . What you need is to take your brother and get as far away from this place as you can . He 's right . We 're wasting time . Miksa . Stop calling me that . This ends one way for anyone who stays , understand ? You know , I thought you 'd give up the act and try giving a shit for a change . Goddamn it ! Don 't be naive . I 'm not who you think I am ! You remember that story I told you about being taken away as a child ? Well , it happened , Only I was the one doing the taking . I don 't believe that . I am a murderer and a parasite . Go on , ask your brother . He knows who I work for . I already told you , she is not one of us . I saw her eyes . Like silver dollars . What the hell have you done ? Is this the willis hypothesis again ? I should have known you 'd never give up on that ridiculous notion . Perhaps she 's a naturally occurring mutation . Oh , this is no mutation , No random roll of the genetic dice . When I find out what you 've done , and I will find out , There will be a reckoning . I wish I could help . Be careful what you wish for . You know there is nothing you can do that I cannot bear . Oh , those aren 't for you . They 're for julia walker . ( whispering ) they 're taking jules away . Run their own tests on her until they find a cure . Then they won 't find anything . Excuse me ? I did multiple runs on julia 's blood and tissue samples , Cross-referenced with her pre-infection blood work . There 's nothing there . What do you mean , nothing ? I mean no immune response . No antibodies , no traces of residual genetic material , No viral dna . As far as I can tell , she 's in perfect health . You 'll have to run those tests again . You mean for a third time ? What you 're saying isn 't possible . Right , because nothing else around here strains credulity . I 'm gonna get jules back . Okay . What can I do ? You didn 't even ask me how . I assumed you already had that part figured out . I 'll need supplies first . Potassium chloride , Muriatic acid , ammonium nitrate . Those are all very unstable , Explosive even . That 's what I 'm counting on . Constance : So , this is how we find ourselves . After all these years , Everything that we 've been through to achieve our goal , And you Jeopardize all of it for your own selfish cause . You 've sacrificed everything . For what ? Ilaria ? I helped build ilaria . They deserve my loyalty . Unfortunately , that doesn 't seem to be your strong suit . I have no problem with loyalty . Genocide , on the other hand ... ( radio beep ) Sutton . Klein : Dr. Walker 's escaped . We 're searching the area now . Where is she ? She may have gotten into the ducts . Then go into the ducts and find her ! We 're gonna need more men . I don 't care how you do it , just bring her back alive ! She really is special to you , isn 't she ? Are you in love with her ? No , that 's too easy . But you do care for her , that much is obvious . What do you see That I 'm not seeing , hiroshi ? I see a pathetic shell of a woman I once loved and admired ... Who now bows at the feet of her masters . Do you have any idea How much I would like to cut that smile off your face ? What 's stopping you ? ( vector shrieking ) ( vector growling ) ( vector growling ) I need to go to the supply room . I need a fermentation flask And a few bags of 50 % dextrose solution . What the hell for ? It 's just dextrose . Sugar water , like what you would find in an iv bag . I know what dextrose is . Okay , so then you know that we need it To make cell cultures grow , right ? I can 't let you out of there . Orders . Fine . And when sutton comes asking for results , you can tell her That we don 't have ' em because you refused to give us the right supplies . I 'll get you what you need . Make me a list . Then it 's settled . There 's not one good reason Why you can 't come back with me . I just can 't . Why not ? Because of hatake ? You don 't owe him anything ! I 'm not running away from a mess I helped create . You were just a kid . This is all you 've ever known . I 've made my own choices . You know , you may not want to believe this , but you two are a lot alike . Dr. Hatake raised me as one of his own . Not him . You and sergio . We 're nothing alike . You were both stolen as children , Brought up in a world built on lies . I see a person who 's never been at peace , Who doesn 't think that they deserve a home Or a family . Or even a second chance . I 'm sorry . I have to finish this . Whatever that means . Don 't forget about us , miksa . You have a family now . Here . Take care of yourself , anana . I need more ammonium nitrate . This is crazy , right ? I mean , look at us . What are we becoming ? What we need to become . Like the virus , mutating , changing in order to survive . ( quiet tapping ) What was that ? Julia : Don 't look up . Julia ? What are you doing up there ? Alan : Do they know you 've escaped ? I haven 't heard any alarms yet . That might change soon . Alan , are you under guard ? Yes . We have Two of ilaria 's finest in observation . Listen , jules , we don 't have much time . I need you to find hatake and free him . Why ? So he can retake the base When we kill sutton . I 'll try to get to him . I know it 's impossible , but please be careful . You too . You ready ? Yeah . Lt. Klein , will you tell sutton That the cure is ready for a review ? We 've been able to Separate the double-binded proteins and re-encode the rna . Have a look . For what ? Don 't you want to see the cure in action ? If you look closely , You 'll see the viral load being completely obliterated . It 's ground-breaking , really . ( explosion ) Automated voice : Contamination . Contamination . Is she ... Is sutton ... I think she took most of the blast , but ... It was ... It was chaotic in there . You mean you don 't blow people up every day ? Okay , so , what now ? We round up with jules and hatake , And then see who comes out of the smoke . Automated voice : Contamination . Constance : Dr. Farragut . Dr. Alan farragut . No doubt you 're surprised to be hearing from me . I can 't imagine what you must be thinking right now . Let 's lay our cards on the table , shall we ? You are to report to isolation . Failure to do so will result in immediate termination of peter farragut . I expect nothing less than your full Cooperation . Hold still . Are you telling me what to do ? You 're ... You 're wounded . The only thing wounded is my vintage dior , So unless you are a seamstress , lieutenant , piss off . Ain 't family a bitch ? No , you can 't go . Look , they will ... They 'll kill him . They 're gonna kill him anyway . The only question is which one of you she 's gonna kill first . What else can we do ? Wait . Alan , Maybe we can create a diversion . Do you know what this is ? I don 't know what lab we 're in . Otology , the study of sound . It 's an lrad device . It 's , um , a sound cannon . Police use them for crowd control . And I 'm pretty sure the mods on this device allow for high-precision targeting . You know how to operate this thing ? A girl 's gotta have her hobbies . ( thumping above ) Julia . You shouldn 't be here . If sutton finds you ... Sutton 's got her hands full right now . Alan needs your help . Of course . On one condition . You stay here , In hiding . I can 't do that . You survived the virus , and sutton knows ... Sutton knows what ? You are more important than anyone else . Why does everybody keep saying that ? What is so special about me ? Please , julia . I promise to answer all of your questions , But now is far from the time . I 'm not going sit here and hide while everybody else is risking their lives . What 's happening to me ? I need answers . You have always been very persistent . It would be a lot easier with the keys . You 're not gonna shoot me . Could be more satisfying knowing you 'll die out there cold , hungry , and alone . I 'll survive . I always have . How 'd you get out ? Somebody wasn 't paying attention . You used me . I told you not to trust me . Yeah , you 're right . Here . You 're gonna take it anyway , right ? You don 't steal from me ! And you never talk about miksa that way , do you understand me ? Go ! Go ! Run away ! Go on ! Man : Freeze ! Stop right there ! Shit ! Go ! Go ! Are you messing with me ? Just shut up and go right now ! They 'll kill you , but they won 't kill me . Just go ! Man : Stop ! Stop her ! Hey , fellas . Go easy on the wound . It 's a little tender . Oof ! Automated voice : Access granted . Julia : Oh , my god . Klein : No sudden moves . Alan . I gave you every opportunity to perform up to our standards , But you let me down . Frankly , I 'm disappointed . You and me both . Unfortunately , we 've reached an impasse . I don 't see how we could possibly move forward together . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to let you go . No ! Ugh ! Constance : Wait until his brother 's dead . Then shoot him . ( high-pitched whine ) ahh ! ( high-pitched whine ) soldier : Ahh ! ( system beeping ) ( shrieking ) ( vector shrieking ) ( high-pitched whine ) ah ! ( high-pitched whine ) ( groaning in pain ) Hatake : Come with me . Now ! Get up ! Let 's go ! Get up ! What happened back there ? The vectors , they took peter up into the ducts . Don 't worry . They won 't harm him . Automated voice : Access granted . Dr. Walker . Julia ! Maybe she 's back up in the ducts . No , ilaria has her . The power grid has been restored . Someone shorted it out . Hatake ? No , the breakers were covered in that black ooze . ( scoffs ) what does it matter ? I 've tried to be patient , but hiroshi has lost his way . He 's worked outside the purview for far too long . We have that cargo you requested . If you 'd like , we can arrange a transfer out immediately . Expedite the transfer . I want wheels up in 60 minutes . And what about the inuit girl ? Constance : What about her ? She escaped the base , Balleseros helping her . I was never under orders to detain her . Didn 't hiroshi ever teach you to take initiative ? Dr. Hatake taught me to protect the research at all costs . And right now , that research is owned by your company . Just tell me what you need . Good boy . Let 's leave the heavy lifting for the next wave . Let them mop up hiroshi 's mess . Ilaria is planning an emergency evac . I thought you should know . How do I know you 're not working for them now ? I 'm here because the only thing worse For this base than you is sutton . Where 's julia ? Sutton did mention something about transporting cargo . If ilaria gets hold of dr . Walker , You will never see her again . Go with him . Find julia . What about sutton ? Leave sutton to me . It 's not ideal , but it 's the best we could do on short notice . It 'll keep the cargo secure until we land . Thank you , lieutenant klein . I can always count on you . ( muffled shouting ) She bit two of my men . Hopefully the muzzle will take care of the biting situation . ( muffled screaming ) Love to travel , just hate to pack . ( muffled screaming ) Give me five minutes . I said I need five . Hiroshi . Constance . Where is dr . Walker ? You always did have a weakness for them . Oh , there were rumors , of course , But I never thought you capable of such a thing . After all these years , you still wear the watch I gave you . The frame is the original piece . I guess once you start replacing parts , It 's never quite the same , is it ? But I 'm touched . We could have changed the world . Yes . But who would want to live in that kind of world ? We took a vow to author a separate history . What gives you the right to turn your back on that , On us ? I was never good enough . We were never good enough . I did not mean to hurt you . Did I turn you away from us ? I tried to make you understand . You were the greatest mind among us , And yet you were willing to throw it all away . For what ? This abomination ? Was it worth it ? Chasing the willis hypothesis to protect your daughter ? I 'm sorry . Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Ah ! Hatake : ( on p.A. ) this is dr . Hatake . The ilaria corporation is no longer in control of the base . Constance sutton has been removed from authority , And all of her men have been placed in custody . From this moment , all base operations Will return to my established protocols . We will rebuild what has been lost , And return to normalcy . Until then , please remain calm . This crisis is in its final stages And will soon be under control . No antibodies ? My blood can 't be used to save anyone . So I live while everyone around me suffers . I could hear everything . All of them talking about me like I 'm some kind of thing . Sutton can 't hurt you anymore . What about the next time ? The next sutton ? I don 't recognize myself anymore . I 'm not the same , alan . We all change . That doesn 't mean we lose who we are .

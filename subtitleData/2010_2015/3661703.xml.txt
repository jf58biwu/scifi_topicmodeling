I was baking bread . BREAD ! YES ! And- - and you ? I was water-skiing . GOOD FOR YOU . Hey , I thought this weekend * * * " vogel 's little field trip kind of closed the window on that . Got that one ? I want a gun . it 's not happening . Going into somalia without a gun is like going scuba diving without an oxygen tank . You 're here in an advisory role . They 're here to back us up . I suggest you stick close to ' em . Let 's get to the tower and get out of here . COME IN . What is that ? The hydra- - seven heads , bad breath , killed by hercules . Why am I looking at it ? gibbons- - dyson frost- - simcoe gave us his name . Here 's the rest of the story . Brilliant , reclusive particle physicist , * * * * * minored in victorian lit . - An achiever . - Typical story- - domineering father , ly spoke to him in french even though they grew up in wyoming . became a chess grand master at 15 . The chess piece you found in pigeon . The white queen . Apparently , he still plays , which is weird considering he was killed in a boating accident in 1990 on a boat called " les monstre deboisteau " - - boisteau 's monster . - who 's boisteau ? - PIERRE BOISTEAU- - 18th CENTURY FRENCH WRITER . He had illustrations of monsters in some of his books . Among the more well-known- - the hydra . THE HYDRA . ON MY BOARD ON THE 29th . It 's all leading back to frost . Somehow , he 's even part of charlie 's vision . Charlie saw him ? gibbons is a bad man . D.gibbons is a bad man . " that 's all I 've been able to get out of her . Meanwhile , everything we know about him is coming to a head , and all we 've got are blind alleys and cryptic messas . What the hell am I supposed to do with that ? Be like hercules and slay the beast . Keep looking for dyson frost . There it is . * * * * * * " keep movin ' . It 's not so bad here . A bit sleepy . a little hotter than I expected . AWAALE , WE NEED YOU TO TRANSLATE . Tell them we 're aid workers with red panda resources , a relief organization , protected under articles 59 through 63 of the geneva convention . He have a right to humanitarian access . My name is abdikalif . I speak english . You don 't need him anymore . flashforward s01e13 I know you . I saw you on al jazeera telling the world you caused the blackout . Always nice to meet a fan . You did not cause this. godcaused this . He merely put your finger on the button . WE ARE EMPLOYEES ... Of red panda . We 're on a relief mission to deliver cholera kits . This man is not a relief worker . We were having mechanical problems . Okay , now if you just let us continue on to our destination- - do not lie to me ! Thiswas your destination . You arrived at your destination . * * * * * Just like the others . What others ? * * * * The foreigne came to our village and told us they would bring us electricity . They said five towers would provide power until the end of time , that it was a humanitarian act . But those towers were not for electricity . They were for something else , something not humanitarian . I had gone out to tend the goats . I was not away long , only a few moments . * * * * * Everything . What happened- - it made no sense . I felt afraid . * * * * * They were gone . Hooyo ! hooyo ! Hooyo ! Hooyo ! But it was all part of god 's plan- - this I learned from my mother- - everything in this life happens for a purpose . And before the hand of death could take hold . I ran . Let me go ! come on . I 'm just the pilot ! That man , for instance , is here for a purpose . And now he has served it . You are here for a reason , and I will kill you- - all of you- - if you do not tell me what that reason is . OH , DAMN . I 'm- - i 'm so sorry . It 's not a big deal. are you okay ? * * * * A little light reading ? I like the pictures . Seriously ? orgo ? Okay , um , just shut upfor a second . * * * - I 'm thinking about possibly- - - thinking about possibly what ? I 'm trying outa pre-med class . * * * So that 's the big secret ?

No , seriously , that 's- - that 's the most difficult thing about becoming a doctor , is picking the right name . I mean , take me , for instance . MY REAL NAMEIS MARTIN GOATHEAD . YOU 'RE AN IDIOT . REALLY . MARTIN GOATHEAD . Yeah , I think I like " bryce varley " better . Ah , of course you do. it sounds rugged . It 's , like , a guythat eats protein bars " * * * * * promise me you won 'ttell anybody , please . NICOLE , I WOULDN 'T DO THATTO YOU . Are you sureyou 're all right ? Oh , look at you . diagnosingpatients already ? I 'm fine . Look , uh , I gotta run , dr. kirby . Dr. goathead . WHY DON 'T WE JUSTTELL ' EM WHO WE Are and why we 're here we 're not breaking cover .

But you will not . You will fulfill your part of the plan . Honey ? HEY ! LUNCH IS READY ! * * * * * - that 's right . - In denver . it 's where we could go- - denver . Mmn of the omelet . IT 'S ONE HELL OF AN OMELET . But seriously , I mean , I 've been doing some research . There 's two major hospitals in denver , and they both need surgeons , and the fbi has a division in denver . * * * * so this is why we 're having lunch . Well , that , and I wanted to see your beautiful face . the mile-high city . I could join the ski police , . . Me by the fire YOU WRAPPED UP IN A VEGAN TIGER SKIN ... Nothing on underneath . Doesn 't sound so bad . Look , I mean , i- - you know , we don 't have to make any decisions right now , but I think we should soon . Hey , there 's , um , something I wanted to talk to you about , too- - something we haven 't been talki about . Charlie , what she saw- - we need to know . Livy , we 've needed to know for a while now . I thought we said we were gonna give her time . * * * * * but if she knows something , something that can help this investigation , * * * well , what is it you think that she knows ? There are things in this investigation that keep coming back . d. gibbons . Mm-hmm , he 's at the center of everything . I kept thinking I could do this without involving our family , we can 't deny this anymore . Listen , i-i have people at the fbi office * * * * I want to take charlie down there tomorrow and just see if maybe- - can you let me talk to her first ? You can take her , but can I try talking to her first ? Okay . This isn 't beyond us , mark . I know . will you take a look at this stuff ? You know , it is one hell of an omelet . On this continent , a child dies every six seconds from malnutrition . Your country could easily provide this food , yet it does not . that 's not true . Every year , we send hundreds of millions of dollars in aid just to have it stolen by people like you . People who live in heaven shouldn 't judge those who live in hell . Tell me who you people are , or I will kill him . Sod off . Who are you ? Tell me . They are cia , here to investigate the tower . We are security . This is your security ? So you are with cia . * * * * I 've gotten used to it . What do you want with that tower ? Why have you brought the scientist here ? WE THINK WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 6th , THE Da of the blackt , happened before on a smaller scale in your village because of the towers . no . I came back from herding the goats . I saw them on the ground. they were dead . It was no blackout . * * * * I saw the black camel . * * * black camel 's considered a bad omen here . Death is a black camel that kneels at every man 's gate . . . were ... dead . I returned from the refugee camps changed , a man now . The bodies of my people were gone , and all that remained was a village of ghosts . And there was only one tower left . Word spread that I had lived when others had died , and for this , I became feared . I used this fear and became what I am now . God 's plan . And then the day of the blackout , * * * * * I was making a speech . * * * * * when again touched by the better angels of our nation . * * * * * * * * 2 * * * * * " I spoke as a conqueror , my enemies crushed- - god 's plan . I 'm not willing to wait one day longer ! There will be one more war in this land- - my war . I will rule this country . * * * * ... will win . And you will help , because you are cia . You can get me these things- - planes , tanks , boats- - what I will need to win my war . That 's not gonna happen . Planes , tanks , boats ! You will get me these things ! No , no , no , no ! It happens every six seconds . Vogel , just make the call . The request alone will tell our people what 's going on . I 'm not going to make the call because no one 's going to pick up the call . It 's like I told you before- - there is no cavalry . * * * * there 's gotta be some options here . * * * * * * that 's it ? we just die ? you saw yourself alive on APRIL 29th . And that lunatic actually saw himself * * " better " Better angels . Which will it be ? Quaad . Wait. get off him ! Which will it be ? Which will it be ? Your prophecy is wrong ! What you saw- - it isn 't what you saw , and I can prove it to you . I know about the better angels . * * * * you say you know about the better angels . Tell me what you know . It 's from abraham lincoln 's inaugural address . - Lincoln was- - - your president. ended slavery . He was strong , not afraid to crush his enemies . We were fighting a civil war in our country , just like your country . " Better angels " was a speech about unity , * * * * you do not know what I saw . No , I don 't , but I think I might be able to find someone who did . Can you get on the internet here ? We created a web site where people can come on and share their prophecies with each other . a man was at the assembly of the african union at a peace conference . you were speaking . How do you know what this man says is true ? You tell me. look , they know your name . They say you were wearing a wire necklace with an amber bead surrounded by two red ones . Do you have something like that ? * * * * * but my mother did . HOOYO ! Hooyo ! I haven 't seen that necklace or my mother since I was a boy . Someone else says they saw you- - said that you were quoting lincoln- - " to every living heart and hearthstone ALL OVER THIS BROAD LAND ... " " Will yet swell the chorus of the union . . " " when again touched ... * * * * * " " you don 't need tanks or guns . Your destiny is tostopthe war , not start one . Yes ! spare ! I 'M THROWING ROCKS TONIG . MARKT , Mommy . Nice job . you want to play ? I think I 'll play after . I want to talk first . Okay . * * * So , uh , do you remember when tim tim talked to squirrlio about heroes ? When finnegan the supershark trapped them in the snow globe of snow doom ? Yeah , squirrlio-zactly ! Yeah , and tim tim said that heroes are people who help people even when it 's hard . well , I needyou to be like a hero , charlie . How ? I need you to be brave and tell me what you saw in your flash-forward . Hey , it 's okay to be afraid . It really is. it 's okay . But if you tell me , you might be able to help daddy , help a whole load of people we don 't even know . IF I TELL- - TELL YOU ... S-something bad will happen . No. no , it won 't . Nothing bad 's gonna happen . I promise , okay ? Nothing . Can you tell me what you saw ? Go ahead. it 's your house , too . We were in the kitchen , and dylan wanted a cookie . Daddy says that you said , " * * * * why 'd you say that ? THE MAN YOU CALL D. GIBBONS LIED To you . * * * * Bad people lie . And dylan made the magnets say that on the refrigerator . bad people lie . * * * * he wasn 't in the house ? Keep going , sweetie . what else did you see ? I HEARD FIREWORKS , And I went to the back door . I saw a man walk up to another man . THEY WERE WEARING SUITS . * * * * It 's okay , sweetie. you can do it . WHAT DID HE SAY ? MARK BENFORD IS DEAD . " MARK BENFORD IS DEAD . * * * * It 's not possible . It 's what she heard . * * * * * * * 2 " that 's why she 's been so frightened to tell us . She 's afraid her daddy 's gonna die . That 's not gonna happen , olivia . ON APRIL 29th , I 'M GONNA BE IN MY OFFICE At my board , alive . Livy , whatever charlie saw , what she said- - oh , god. it 's not that . Thenhat is it ? this is the part where i tell you that we could escape this . we could go anywhere * * * * and get away from it all , get away from all of this . And this is the part where you tell me that you won 't . Right . There 's gonna be another blackout . And I have to see this through . I have to try and stop it . I HAVE TO TRY . What happened to the world happened in your village first . At least , that 's our operating theory . * * * * they were blacked out . They had prophecies ? That 's what we think . We had hoped to find some of them and talk to them . * * * the people , my mother- - * * * I saw the black camel . I thought the devil had taken their souls . The koran- - chapter 66verse 6 . " Save yourself and your families " I painted it myself as a warning . In all my time , I haven 't been in there . Devil or no , it is an evil place . But there is one thing that can push a man more than fear . What 's that ? destiny . You look like you 've seen a ghost . It 's entirely the opposite . What I designed was theoretical . It could only be done in the future , and yet it 's been standing here for 18 years . Welcome to the future . You said these designs were stolen from you ? This was built in ' 91 , but you didn 't come up with the concept till ' 92 . I DON 'T KNOW HOW THAT 'S POSSIBLE . Someone must have invented it before you . No.this is exactly what I designed . whoever did this , why would they leave it behind for somebody to find ? * * * * * * * * * then why didn 't they ever come back to finish ? The war hasn 't stopped . Found something . It 's a chessboard . It 's been sitting here for 18 years . AND WE HAVE PORTABLE POWER . Here 's to hoping . WHAT DID YOU SEE ? I knew this boy . He was my friend . what 'd he say ? He said he saw himself playing a game . AND DID IT HAPPEN ? He said what he saw came true . WHAT DID YOU SEE ? This is my mother . She was looking for me . E couldn 't find me , but she had hope . She knew I would survive , . I would become great . The preceding interviews from test group " b " confirm that the subjects uniformly experienced a consciousness shift two weeks into the future . That 's the man who shot at us in utah . That 's d.gibbons * * * * * * * In 1991 ? CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT . You see ? God didn 't have anything to do with this . This was man . OVER HERE ! What are you seeing , simon ? Simon ! This tunnel- - vacuum systems , the lead shielding- - it 's a linear accelerator , one of five . Smaller , less powerful versions than the ones we use at n.l.a.p. They ran a pimeter around the village . Somehow they unleashed a tachyon burst , creating a beta test of the global blackout you weren 't in the village at the time the experiment was conducted , which explains why you didn 't lose consciousness . If what you 're saying is true , it took five accelerators to creatthis beta blackout . There 's no way that just one knocked out the entire world , right ? how can you possibly say that ? Technology moves fast , agent noh . Even if you knew the rules , which you don 't , I don 't think they apply anymore . I got something down here ! Ready ? Go . I don 't think your people were driven off by the war . They were shot Executed , all of them . Remote village , wartime . Given all the unrest , they knew nobody they showed them tomorrow and ripped it away . You said God has nothing to do with these . Hooyo ! hooyo ! That it was man . but it was not any man . It was you . No.those plans were stolenfrom me . I said you were sent here for a reason . Now I know what that reason is . - GOD DELIVERED YOU TO ME ... - ABDI , NO ! * * * * * * * * let your end mark a new beginning ! No ! OH , MY GOD . " his vision . This wasn 't supposed to happen .

 In the mid 1950s , in the midst of post-war chaos crime outfits known as " kumi " sprung up around Japan . They became the yakuza . The yakuza underworld is ruled by chivalry and loyalty . This is known as " jingi . " If a yakuza violates " jingi " there 's hell to pay for the yakuza live and die by this principle . You only get hit when you 're afraid of getting hit . I can even scare landmines with a glare ! Time to settle the score ! Hit me if you can ! TAK SAKAGUCHI SHINGO TSURUMI MEI KUROKAWA AKAJI MARO JUN MURAKAMI Original Story by KEN ISHIKAWA Junior ! Colonel Joseph 's in there ! . Santaro ! Junior , you stepped on a mine ... Big deal . Takuzo , make it go off with me ! . Yes , sir ! . Willpower ! . Through hell and high water ! . Colonel Joseph , at last . You deserve this stick ! It 's kejime , let 's settle the score ! . Ke-ji-me ? . What a brawl ! And I won ! Directed by TAK SAKAGUCHI YUDAI YAMAGUCHI He 's mine . Stay back . Freeze . Make my day . No wonder they call you Mad Dog . Right , Shozo Iwaki ? . Who the hell are you ? . We 're government agents from Japan . We brought news of your father . Six months ago , your father , the Boss of the Iwaki Family , was attacked as he left a Western Japan Yakuza council meeting . He took 88 bullets in his body but he cornered his assailant . Right before his heart stopped he screamed out your name . Shozo ! . What a tearjerker , that old fart ! You no-good fool ! Who do you think you are ? . Time has left you and your old ways behind . Let me take over . Go trim your bonsai ! You arrogant bastard , you deserve this ! That suits me fine . Have a piece of me ! Next time you show up , keep this in mind . Get ready to kill or be killed ! Damn right ! The cords are breaking ... ! Shit , my ass got split in half ! Japan ! . I 'm finally back ! . The air 's sweet with smog ! It 's been 4 years . The brothers will be happy to see you back . Why is it Rising Sun Loans now ? . Rising Sun Loans for your brighter spending life ! Come right in ! This way please , gentlemen . Welcome to Rising Sun Loans . We 're not here for a loan . If I 'm not mistaken , wasn 't this the Iwaki Family 's headquarters ? . You with the Iwaki Family ? Oh , no , no ! It 's just that some time ago we had a little business with the Iwaki Family . Look at yourselves . What are you wearing ? Modern yakuza don 't dress so obviously ! They 're dressed to kill in suits ! Anyhow , whatever became of the Iwaki Family ... ? . When the Boss died the Family fell apart . We 're the Shimada Family of the Kurawaki-kumi . Kurawaki and Shimada ... ? They were the Boss 's junior officers ! Mr. Kurawaki is the ruler of Japan 's underworld now ! . Now beat it . Who 's behind this ... ? Stop babbling ! Did you know that Boss Iwaki had a good-looking son ? . Who 's he ? Be quiet ! What 's that fracas ! . You broke my concentration so I couldn 't shit . They 're Iwaki 's associates . He 's talking about Iwaki 's son . Iwaki 's son ... That must be Shozo . That idiot ! He was born without enough brain cells . He was thoughtless and foolhardy . He barked at anybody he saw . He was a beast but in front of me , he was a kitty ! You 're the man ! I was kind of crazy in my youth ... You go , you go ! Die , fuckers ! Shozo ! . Shimada , so you 're a boss man now . I 'm not the man you used to know ! Come on ! That suits me fine ! You have more hair on your head ! Shut up ! . Motherfuckers ! I ; d appreciate a little more enthusiasm . After all , I , Kurawaki , wouldn 't be here today if it wasn 't for all the yakuza bosses in Japan . But we ' ve looked after you since you were a baby ! . Is this how you pay us back after all we 've done for you ? Let me make myself clear . I 'm merely trying to save you from yourselves . And yet you choose to reject my offer . The days of guns and knives are long over . Today it 's all about business . You 're talking about the yakuza ! Let me say this one more time . You want all the families united under your name . But none of us in the East and West will agree to that . If you want to take us on , be ready to fight . I hear rumors that you framed Boss Iwaki . You don 't have a fragment of chivalry or loyalty . We have ways of dealing with men like you . Oh , jingi , is it ? . There 's no place for emotions in business . That 's my principle . We 're wasting time . Let 's go . You 're all too weak to do anything . Face reality . Shozo , wait a minute , please ! Shimada . I know you don 't have the guts for these schemes . Caddie , what have we got ? . A par-two hole , no flagstick . I was just told to manage this loan operation ! No wind . Nice shot ! The first shot was all right . Listen , Shozo ! I didn 't kill your old man ! So was it the other guy who killed him ? . Sister Nayoko . How infatuated I was with you ! When you were a schoolgirl I jacked off thinking of you . Kurawaki , you slime ... But you were engaged as arranged by your parents . I was too low in the yakuza ranks to even talk to you . He will return to me . Don 't you find me more suitable now ? . I 'd prefer to marry a mitochondrion than you . She sure is something . Was she talking about that knucklehead ? . Yes , but he 's safely out of the picture . He 's probably dead on the other side of the Earth , covered in crap . He deserves it . Speaking . Kurawaki , how have you been ? . Want to play golf with me ? . It 's the knucklehead , Shozo ! I 'm about to nail a hole . Watch out , it 'll be loud ! Boss . Boss , help me ! Shimada . Swing to the rhythm ! Nice shot . Shimada 's form is so bad it affects my play . I want to play with you . You 're a fly buzzing around shit . I like your spirit . I hope it won 't ricochet back at you . We 're all players now . Junior . Where 's Kurawaki hiding ? Look at that . Has that tall building always been here ... ? . He 's probably up there , looking down at us . I 'll drag him down after I had a little more fun . Ouch ! Damn it ! Shozo ! . Nayoko ? . How dare you come back , looking so innocent ? Run , fuckers ! Shozo ! . Nayoko , wait a minute ! Oh , I missed you ! Shozo . When you left Japan 4 years ago you wrote me a letter . And you wrote ... " Supersaver , 20 % OFF ! . " Shozo , I 'll get you for this ! " I 'll marry you when I get back . " Junior , it 's all clear . Okay , let 's go in . This is a respectable coffee shop . We serve no pasta alla carbonara . Die , punk ! Then I might serve you ! Hey , you haven 't changed a bit . Junior , good to see you in one piece . The usual , please . I got spaghetti drowning in ketchup ! And a melon soda float . Our specialty . That 's the way I like it . You wasted no time making trouble . Kurawaki 's men are all over looking for you . That jackass ! I 'll send him back to hell and beyond . Rumor has it that Kurawaki has gained a lot of power because he 's got backing from a foreign syndicate . His plan is to assimilate West and East outfits . He wants the whole of Japan under his rule . Not bad for a jackass . The foreign connection wants to market a drug here that 's 100 times stronger than skag . They call it the hyper drug . Kurawaki , he 's the lowest ... He agreed to stay away from skag like my father told us ! That suits me ! He 'll learn what it means to have me as an enemy ! Damn , it 's cold ! Junior ! I 'll get you some tissues . Nobody 's lasted this long against me . I thought you were just the Big Boss 's baby boy . But you 're tough alright . The fight 's not finished . Not ' til your heart stops . If anybody picks on me I get them back 500-fold . That 's my principle ! I 'll take you to the bottom of hell ! Stop ! You 've had enough , boys . Don 't tell me what to do ! . Damn , your father fights like the devil ... Wait ' til he retires in a few years . His ass is mine ! I like the way you talk tough . You 're not so bad yourself . He tied us too close to each other . You stink of sweat ! No , you stink ! Shozo , you 're Thunder God and I 'm Storm God . Whenever we meet we fight to death . But we both live on the same cloud . Damn right ! We should become brothers for life . How do we do that ? . I 'll show you how . You or I ... Who will rule the world first ? . It 's a dare . You 'll lose , I know it already ! . Quiet ! Shut the hell up ! . What 's Tetsu up to nowadays ? . He was jailed for his family 's crimes . Nobody 's heard anything since then . That 's just like Tetsu ... Ready , Takuzo , Santaro ? Yes , sir ! What are you going to do , Junior ? . Bugs fly into the light , you see ? . So I 'll set off some fireworks . 1 potato , 2 potato ... They 're beautiful , big bro . I let him have too much fun . That retarded animal could use some discipline . There it goes ! Damn you ! The next time I see Shozo , I 'll have him buried ! Sister Nayoko , I know it 's none of my business but ... The harder you try to catch a man , the more he runs . Particularly a man like him . He 's my weakness ... It 's on the house . Who 's there ? . I served 5 years in jail for the family and this is how I get thanked ! . Sumire ! Hello , Tetsu . Tetsu , brother ... Tetsu . Don 't get me wrong . I 'm not doing this because I like it . Your sister told me she 'd do anything to protect you , Tetsu . That 's what she said . So I have to test how deep her love is for you . How much deeper it can go , you know ? . You 're going to hell ... I 'll need company then . What happened to you ? . Sorry , Junior ... They took Nayoko ... Kurawaki , that sneaky motherfucker ! What 's this ... ? What 's going on ? . Round-rimmed glasses and long pigtails ... This is how you looked 7 years ago . Remember ? . Hey ! Put this on . Stop it ! I learned one thing from the knucklehead . If you want something , get it by all means necessary . Your flaccid prick would sting as much as a mosquito bite ! You 're irresistible . What was that ? . Kurawaki ! Come out ! Shozo ! You sneaky bastard ! A true yakuza fights fair ! . My security should be impenetrable ... Unbelievable ... Kurawaki . Come on down ! A small-time bad guy like you can 't afford to sit back and watch . I 'm going to let you have it ! Big bro ... You come up ! That is , if you can . You 're my 276th victim ! . I 'll rip you all apart ! On each floor I have our toughest fighters on guard . Nobody can fight them all , not even you . Are you done with your speech ? . What a lot of trouble you went to ! They 're all trained to kill . You 're no match for them . Takuzo ! Yes , sir ! . What the ... ? I 'm not going up to you ! You 're coming down to me ! . He wouldn 't ... ! 1 , 2 , 3 ! . Shozo , you crazy bastard ! Ouch ... What 's this ? . What 's going on ? . Big bro , look ! Hey , Kurawaki . Shozo ... I know you 're up there . It was looking like a lot of trouble so I took a short cut . Hey , you 're here too ! Don 't play dumb , you brain-dead moron ! Shit , what 's with the costume ? . You almost blew me up , moron ! You 're so loud ... Here I come . Let 's settle the score . Give me some kejime ! . You 're mistaken . I didn 't do anything bad . I heard that you framed my old man . Not me ! Let me refresh your memory . Junior ! Bastard ! Come back , untie me ! Sorry , Sister . It doesn 't hurt a bit ! Maybe he 's not human ... Get me again ! It 'll be a yakuza 's medal of honor ! He 's a genuine moron . Checkmate ! Willpower ! No ... ! Adios , amigo ! Shozo ! Junior . Junior , why ... ? . How could you leave us like that ! He was a moron to the end . Say that again ! Who are you calling a moron ! Junior ! You 're alive . Of course I 'm alive ! Junior ! Your leg ! Don 't you ever die ? . Kurawaki , bastard ! Takuzo , give me a pack . Kurawaki , if you want this brawl to end , you 've got to kill me . It 's away ! Stop right there . I know you ! We said we were Japanese agents . But there 's more . I 'm the Prime Minister 's special agent , Torahiko Akao . Also known as Red Tiger . Shozo Iwaki , you 're in our custody as of now . If you think a fella like you can arrest Shozo Iwaki ... You bitch , what the ... Shozo ! Junior ! You assholes ! Shozo ! Where am I ... ? . Shozo , I 'm turning you into the toughest yakuza ever . I 'm already the toughest yakuza ever ... " New Kurawaki Building , to be constructed soon " Big bro 's right . It 's a good plan . Tatsuyuki ... What is it that I have and Shozo doesn 't ? . That 's true . I have you , my dependable ally . But I have something far superior to him . And that is ... That 's right . A brain . " Tetsu OKamura Escapes ! " It 's chow time ! . Stay ! Go ahead ! BrotherTetsu , this is it . Thank you for everything ! Yasu . I heard that you 're leaving me for the Iwaki Family . Give them my regards , will you ? . You said you 'd quit . You said you 'd quit , brother ! Don 't do this to yourself ! Tell me something , Sumire . Will I ever get ahead of Shozo ? . Will I ? . My body 's killing me ... Sumire . It 's too much ... Sumire . I think I 'm coming to where you are ... Take this . And the pain will go away . What 's this ? . And it 'll help you ... surpass him . Surpass him ... ! " Keep Out " What 's taking them so long ? What in the hell are they doing in there ? He said , " Leave it to us . " We did that but all this waiting is driving me crazy ! Sister ! Are you OK ? . How 's Shozo ? . Don 't worry . He 's in the hands of the best surgeons and scientists . Who are you people anyway ? . Didn 't Red Tiger tell you ? . The Prime Minister 's special agents . I don 't understand politics ! Nobody knows our agency exits . We 're only deployed when there 's a threat to Japan . We work for the Prime Minister and are sworn to secrecy . We 're licensed to kill , if needed . It sounds like bullshit to me . What 's this place anyway ? . If your agency is such hot stuff this place would be impressive like an embassy . You can 't fool us . Like I said , we are secret agents . This is an abandoned spa resort . A perfect hideout for our operation . Cut the bullshit . What do special agents want with wise guys like us ? . It 's the Death Drop Mafia . Kurawaki has been on a meteoric rise lately . He 's so powerful he can mobilize military forces . We figured that he must have support from somewhere . Is the Death Drop Mafia behind Kurawaki ? . I 'm sure you 've heard of them . The world 's largest syndicate that practically owns the US Forces . The United Yakuza International ! What 's wrong ? . This is Black Dahlia . Zodiac is on Red Tiger . We 're on Iwaki 's son . After we complete the mission , blow up this place , copy ? . In here . He 's not on yet . He 's out on a super strength anesthesia . It would have killed any normal person . Boss is wise to strike now . Kurawaki can 't handle him . Once he 's awake , there 's no stopping him . What are you doing , you ... ! The anesthesia isn 't working ! You 're finished , Shozo ! Sounds like he 's awaken . Hey , it 's time you explain to us what 's going on ! Ouch ! God damn it ! Get him ! Go on ! Ouch ! This hurts like hell ! Shozo is no longer what he was . The best of Japan is invested in him ! He 's the yakuza weapon ! Yakuza ... weapon ? . What the hell is this ? . Ouch ! Ouch , ouch , ouch ... ! Shozo ! After going through the bionic operation ... it must hurt like hell . We needed something to take on the Death Drop Mafia 's latest weapons . Ouch ! We applied Japan 's superior human-weapon technology . It hurts ... Damn ! I 'll mince them ! The M61 Vulcan on the right arm will shred any human . And installed on the left knee is ... Fight like a man , a fist fight ! ... an anti-tank rocket launcher . Ouch ! I can 't take this ! It hurts more than the arm ! . Who asked you to do that to him ? . You did what you liked with him ... ! You can thank us ! He would have been permanently crippled ! The best of Japan went into his body ! Shozo . Bastard , what did you do to me ? Fire if you like . Just know this . Japan 's future depends on you ! Shozo , blow him up in pieces ! . He used you like a lab rat ! Junior ! I know ! Be cool , Shozo . Well , thanks , Red Tiger . This new body kicks ass ! I love it ! Are you nuts ? Junior , your brain 's damaged ... Sure I was surprised when I first saw it . I 'm invincible with this body . The toughest yakuza in history ! . Watch out ! . You sure he 's the right man ? . I never make wrong choices . Prepare for the next attack . Shozo . Are you going to do what they tell you to do ? I 'd better . Look at me now . Look at me , don 't I look good ? . You don 't need this to ... Sure , I don 't need this to be the toughest ! But I work for the Japanese government now . I 'm a government certified yakuza ! The toughest in history ! Your father wanted you to be the head of the Iwaki Family , and ... Shozo , decide . It 's now or never . I 'm talking about what our parents decided for us ... You know ? . About us ... Our engagement ? It 's something our parents decided . We 're young and naive . None of our parents are alive . You shouldn 't be tied to the past . Shozo ! Ouch ... Stop acting up ! Behave ! Nayoko ? . Are you OK , Nayoko ? . Of course I 'm not OK , you scum ! Sorry , I can 't operate this properly yet . You want to kill me ? . Come on , I 'll take you on ! Shut up , you ugly dog ! You 're getting me worried ! Kurawaki 's men could still be around . Mind your own business ! I 'd prefer if rickettsia bacteria in the sewer worried about me ! . Die , idiot ! Same to you , scum ! That suits me fine , that no-good bitch ! . Junior , where 's Sister ? How should I know ? . Ouch ! Moron ! Death Drop Mafia is on the move . Die , suckers ! Damn ! I 'll give it a rest ! Wake up ! Ouch , I just can 't get used to this . Damn , it hurts . Oh , they make me work hard . Junior . You don 't know when to stop ! . They 're not the big fish ! Where has Kurawaki gone ? . What 's this smell ? It 's gas ! No gas scares true yakuza ! Motherfuckers ! Your asses are mine ! Takuzo , I want something powerful ! Something devastating ! . How about this ? . Yes ! Death to the fuckers ! Go to pieces , bastards ! This is it ! No summer ends without fireworks ! . You ! Come on . I didn 't want to look like this either , right Big bro ? . Kurawaki ? Nayoko . I 've always wanted you . But you never ... ever ... gave a damn about me . Not a bit ... It 's changed now . I own you now . Finally you 're mine . Sorry to disappoint you but if you thought you 'd be more appealing as a heap of junk ... you 're wrong ! Don 't be rude ! Never mind that , Tatsuyuki . Nayoko , you 're so desirable . That knucklehead ... You think you have a chance against Shozo ? . He 's not the Shozo you know . Give up before he gets you . We have an ace in the hole . Shozo , this time ... I 'll finish you off . Is that all ? . I haven 't had enough ... Where 's that bastard Kurawaki ? . In the parking lot . I have a life reading there . Let 's get him . Don 't kill him . I want him alive . He has information . Sorry , but I 'll shred him . Shozo , listen . I 'd be silly if I let you do as you please . I can shut you down by pressing the red button . Now go and do as I say ! Nobody shuts me down now . Shozo , don 't ! I 'm coming to get you , Kurawaki ! She 's naked ! I 'll take her on . You fellas wait here . Hey , girl , I 'll kick your ass ! But first put on something . You 're so exposed ... What would your folks say ? . Here , go buy something to wear . Then we 'll rock . Have we met somewhere before ? . Come here . What the hell ? . Junior , are you OK ? . Kurawaki 's assassins aren 't bad ! . Eat my bullets ! They 're gone ! Junior , they 're real bad-asses . Stay focused ! I know ! Junior ! Stay back ! Eat this ! Not bad at all . Tetsu ... ? . Junior ! Leave us ! This is between me and him . Tetsu ! Tetsu ! It 's you , isn 't it ? . Shozo . Tetsu . It 's me , Shozo . What 's wrong with you ? . Hey , Sumire ... I 'm going to surpass Shozo , this time for sure . Shozo ! Die ! Son of a bitch ! Get the killer ammo ! What do you want ? Junior , there 's nothing these bullets won 't penetrate ! Yeah ! Not again ... They take everything away from me ... Stay back ! Tetsu ! Tetsu . Fellas like us ... should be fist fighting . Nobody 's lasted this long against me . Shozo . Shozo , you 're Thunder God and I 'm Storm God . Whenever we meet we fight to death . But we both live on the same cloud . Damn right ! Tetsu , do you remember ? . We beat the shit out of each other whenever we met ... Tetsu , you 've done enough . Son of a bitch ... " Big Boss Iwaki rests here " Big bro , it 's ready ! How long has it been , Big Boss ? . I never dreamed to see you again like this . Shozo ! Big Boss ! . Kurawaki . You traitor ! You bastards . The yakuza 's way is the way of guns and knives . And chivalry and loyalty are the order . But you 've gone the wrong way . I need no Death Drop Mafia to help me conquer Japan ! I have this ! I have the weapon to end all weapons ! The only thing that can fight the yakuza weapon and win ! A nuclear warhead ! You just sound desperate to me . Look at this marvelous weapon ! The warhead is embedded in the man who once ruled half of Japan ! You know what this means ? He 's the new threat of nuclear fallout to the nation ! Way to go , Big bro ! He 's the Atomic Yakuza ! Kurawaki . Sounds like a great bash . When did you show up ? . Shozo ! Around when you were talking about fallout . I know now , Kurawaki . You really want me to kill you . Look at this ! What 's that tinker toy ? This is the nuclear warhead 's detonator . It 'll activate the warhead when I die . I call this the the deadliest dick ? . Give me a break . You 're wasting your time , Kurawaki . I 'll do anything to get you . Shoot me , and we 'll all die . I know you 're brainless but even you can figure this out . If you destroy my dick , your pop 's warhead will detonate ! You have only one choice . Kneel down and accept your defeat . I 'm my father 's son , after all . I only know one way to live . That 's my boy . You 're a yakuza ! Do what you have to , Shozo ! Kurawaki , you figured me wrong . You picked a fight with me and you figured I 'd back out ? . What ... ? I am a yakuza . It matters none if it 's a gun or nuclear ! All that matters is life or death ! Shozo , kick their asses ! Do you understand the situation ? . It 's nuclear ! Fallout ! Death ! Shut up , you virgin nerd ! I 've long decided to go wherever Shozo goes . That includes hell ! Well said , Nayoko . That 's the way a yakuza 's wife should talk . You ... ! You 'll die slowly ! Wait ! This one 's for my pop ! And this one 's for Tetsu ! You 've gone insane ! Junior ! No nuke scares a true yakuza ! Shozo ... I am the yakuza weapon ! English subtitles by Dean Shimauchi

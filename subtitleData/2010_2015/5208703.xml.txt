 Julia : Chester 's mill is a place like any other . At least it used to be , Until we were cut off from the rest of the world By a mysterious dome . ( cows bellowing ) Invisible , indestructible , And completely inescapable . We 're trapped . Julia : We don 't know where it came from or why it 's here , But now that we 're all trapped under the dome together , None of our secrets are safe . I know , junior . What are you talking about ? About angle . Hello ? ( gasps ) ( gun cocks ) Nobody 's gonna follow you anywhere , Ever , when they hear just exactly who you are . The military plans to launch a powerful missile In the hopes of destroying the dome . All right , everybody , stay put , and remain calm ! ( explosion rumbling ) I can 't believe it . The dome 's still here . Good thing they evacuated everyone outside . Hey , you guys okay ? We saw the missile hit the dome . ( electrical crackling ) Didn 't even put a dent in it . Grinnell : What 's it made of if a bomb couldn 't blow it up ? She 's right . How is that possible ? I don 't know . Nothing about this thing makes any sense . You can say that again . Still smooth as a baby 's butt . Big jim : Stay back ! Stay back , everyone ! Remember sheriff perkins . Touching that thing exploded his damn pacemaker . Norrie ? Mom ! Honey , honey . Oh , god , are you okay ? I 'm sorry I ran off . Oh . If anything had happened to you ... Linda ? Where are your deputies ? Well , who do you think I 'm trying to find ? He didn 't evacuate to the factory with everyone else . Yeah , I 'm looking for him myself , but he 's a big boy . He can handle himself . I wish I could say the same for reverend coggins . Carter found his body by the dome where we had visitors ' day . Good lord . Coggins is dead ? His hearing aid exploded . He must have touched the dome , and it just fried him . Ollie : First duke , now the reverend ? Well , how many more of us is this thing gonna kill ? Just take it easy , ollie . You 're scaring people , okay ? Well , it 's a little too late for that now . We 've all banded together before , and we survived , okay ? Grinnell : Yeah , until we run Out of food in here . How about electricity ? I 'm nearly out of propane . Been warming up canned soup in my fireplace . I suggest we take this to a town hall meeting . We ... What , so you can keep jawing while more people die ? Hey , my jawing 's gotten us through plenty , ollie . Now , why don 't you help By keeping your damn head on straight ? Can we please just get out of here ? Yeah , before a fight breaks out . It 's , like , a hundred degrees today . Let 's get back to the car . Joe , you can come with us . Honestly , I 'm a little scared . What happens when we run out of everything ? What do we do then ? I don 't know . ( loud electrical shriek ) The walkies aren 't working . ( high-pitched beeping ) I can 't get a frequency . ( static crackling ) hey , Barbie , till I can reach my deputies ... I 'm gonna need another hand . I 'll help you , but I don 't need your badge . We can talk about how this will work . Julia : I 'm gonna head over See if they 're picking anything up from the outside . I 'll see you later ? Yeah . Okay . Ollie : You know what this means , folks ? We 're never getting out of here . Ollie , at least you have a farm to feed yourself . ( siren whoops ) what about the rest of us ? Big jim : You have my word , people ! No one 's gonna starve in chester 's mill . It 's crazy . Five minutes ago , I thought we were gonna die . It 's worse not knowing what 's next . You don 't need to be scared , angie . Didn 't you notice I 'm a deputy now ? People trust me , Just like you should . Whatever happens , I 'll take care of you . ( grunting ) Angie , don 't do this ! Angie ! ( groans ) angie ! Alice : Just let me out of the car . Let me out of the car . ( panting ) Why 'd you make me stop ? What 's wrong ? I just ... I need some air . It 's boiling hot in there . Mom , are you okay ? She-she 's fine . Alice , just get back in the car . I 'll blast the ac . What time 's our flight ? What flight ? To l.A. I don 't want to miss it . Norrie : Mom , watch out ! ( horn blaring , brakes squealing ) Oh , my god ! Are you okay ? ( groans ) ( siren whoops ) Is everybody okay ? What happened ? Alice didn 't see the truck coming . The driver swerved and hit the tower . Joe and norrie pulled him out just in time . Hey . Oh , got him . Good job , you guys . The pipe 's a goner . Where 's your tower get its water from ? Lake eastpointe . It 's our main source . All right , well , we 'll haul water from there . In the meantime , we should check it out . Okay , look-look at me , look at me . Alice , when 's the last time you took your insulin ? I ran out . With the bomb craziness and everything , I just ... I lost track . Come on , we got to get you to the clinic right now . Okay ? What 's wrong with your mom ? She 's a diabetic . Kind of loses it when she forgets to take her insulin . ( high-pitched beep , static crackling ) ( eerie whirring , high-pitched squealing ) What is that noise ? I don 't know , But it 's jamming our broadcast . Kind of sounds like the alien from aliens . Well , all the police walkies are making the same sound . Is dodee picking up any military chatter From outside the dome ? Oh , screech is jamming that , too . And if it 's this loud , then the source is probably close . How close ? Best guess ? Mile or two . So it 's inside chester 's mill ? ( static stops ) ( sighs ) ( sighs ) Listen , if it 's that close , maybe we can find it . Dodee : One step ahead of you , julia . Do I even want to know what that is ? Us radio heads call it a " yagi . " I rigged it to locate the source of the screech Using frequency triangulation . Look , whatever this screech is , It can 't be a coincidence that it started Just as the missile was about to hit the dome . You think the dome was trying to scream ? Or protect itself . Dodee : Who knows ? It might be what 's generating the dome itself . We just have to follow the signal to the power source . Well , if that 's true , then if we can track it down ... Maybe we can turn it off . It 's none of my business , but you 're lucky to have her . Her ? I have eyes , you know . Oh , julia and I aren 't exactly an item . Well , from the sparks that I saw flying , you should be . I 'd kill to have rusty back right now . How long you two been together ? Three years . We 're supposed to get married next month . But now it just seems like some dream I made up . What the hell ? You can 't be out . I was just here the other day . You had insulin . We have 23 diabetics in chester 's mill . Our insulin supply is gone . Pharmacy has to have some . When reverend coggins ransacked the place , He took all of the drugs , including the insulin . What are we supposed to do ? Pray . Jim , we have a situation . The water tower ... Yeah , I know ; it fell . We 'll just have to get our water from lake eastpointe . Can 't . What are you doing ? This is the water from the lake . It 's polluted with methane . Must 've cut through an underground mineral pocket When the dome came down . So it 's undrinkable . Yeah , until we figure out how to filter it . What about rain ? Is that dome high enough for storm clouds to form ? I have no idea . You know , not too many people take the time To get to know their town . A shame , really . There 's history here . Right in our own backyards . My grandfather gave me this map when I was a kid . I used to spend hours poring over it , Learning the lay of the land . There are artesian wells underneath chester 's mill . You know , some have dried up by now , but , uh ... This one here is still flowing strongly . It 's right under ollie densmore 's place . And I 'm guessing he owns the rights . We have to go see him . No , no , no , no . That he can be a pain in the ass , so ... I 'll go talk to him . Dad . Where you been ? You okay ? I can 't find angle . She 's gone . Was she with you when the bomb went off ? Yeah , but she ... Got away . Well , then find her . If she opens her mouth About being locked up ... Wait . Wait a minute . Now , I 've been looking for her . Besides , you 're the one who let her go . Damn it . Don 't you put this on me , junior . This is your mess . And right now , I got one of my own . So for once in your life , do your own damage control . Get out there and find that girl . Hey , so how long has big jim known ollie densmore ? Way duke told it , all their lives . Jim and ollie would be friends one day And then enemies the next . They 'd patch it up over a burger at sweetbriar , but ... They 'd be fighting about something new The following week . ( crowd clamoring ) And speaking of fighting , we should probably check this out . ( clamoring continues ) Folks , listen , I 'm sorry , but the only payment I can accept Is either propane or batteries . Man : So our money 's no good now ? I mean , we got cash . And we 've been waiting out here forever . Terry , what 's going on here ? I 'm just trying to explain the new reality to these people . Look , I can 't feed my family With money no one 's gonna take . Man : New reality ? Sounds like a scam to me . I 'm not trying to ... Hey , come on , guys , come on . Is it true the lake is ruined ? I hear we 're gonna run out of water . Starting a panic is not gonna help anyone . All right ? So , does anybody here have batteries That we can loan to dres ? Anybody ? Thank you . There 's no need for alarm . I 'm sorry for making a scene . Thank you , sheriff . Barbie : You really believe that ? You always believe in the goodness of people you serve . That 's what duke taught me on the first day of the job . Yeah , and if they prove you wrong ? Rule number two You do what you got to do . That 's not a good idea . Why ? I mean , didn 't you have a gun when you chased after randolph ? Yeah , but randolph killed freddy . These people ... ( crowd clamoring in distance ) ... These people are scared . ( clamoring continues ) To tell you the truth ... So am I. Ollie ! Hey ! Won 't take up too much of your time . All the time in the world for you , big jim . We got a water problem . That concerns me , Uh ... How ? And the people of chester 's mill could really use your help . What 's in it for me ? How about a sense of civic pride ? That 's typical . You always take me for granted , jim . All us farmers . Till now . You still sore the town council Took kip lester 's side on that fence dispute ? That so-called " fence dispute " lost me seven acres of my farm . That was 15 years ago , ollie . Well , that 's a drop in the bucket Compared to how long you and me go back . I figured I could 've counted on you . You know the law tied my hands on that . Like that 's stopped you before now . Damn it , be reasonable , ollie . That 's exactly what I 'm being . You want my water , you 'll have to pay for it . Today at the dome , you were talking about Running low on propane . You know , the propane it takes To run your irrigation system and light your house . L-let me guess . You have some . Plenty . ( chuckles ) Why am I not surprised big jim rennie Just happens to have what chester 's mill needs In its moment of crisis ? It 's nothing sinister , ollie . Town keeps a reserve in case of emergency . You get me propane , town gets its water . Carter : Just in time . Things getting out of control ? Not yet , but the mood 's pretty ugly . Barbie , get inside and keep peace at the register . Carter , slow the flow of people going inside . ( crowd clamoring ) Where have you been all morning ? Sorry , linda , I got a situation I need to take care of . I 'm looking for someone . Well , I need you to do your job . Man : You can let more people in your store . Come on ! Ladies and gentlemen , due to demand , We are now limiting each customer 's purchase to a total Of two liters of water . Work the aisles . Just keep smiling , and ... Stay alert . Junior : Waylon , clint , hold it . Isn 't this cute ; little big jim playing cop . Drop those and step back . Or what ? You gonna teach us a lesson ? If I have to . Hey , uh , come on . Are you serious ? Hey ! I was here first ! Ida ... My son is sick ; I need this ! I don 't care ! Hey , hey , come on , ladies . ( women arguing ) hey , knock it off . Knock it off . Joe , what am I going to do ? I can 't just let my mom die . Not like this . Tell me how to help . I 'll do anything . Wh-where are you going ? The nurse said that There 's a bunch of other diabetics in town . Their files have to be in here somewhere . Okay , you think people are just gonna Give you their insulin if you ask ? Who said I was gonna ask ? N-norrie ... If you don 't like it , don 't come . Julia : Are we getting closer to the signal ? ( slow , steady beeping ) no . What ? Our source- - all of a sudden , it 's moving . What kind of a power source moves ? I 'm not sure . ( slow beeping continues ) ( sighs ) : All right , well ... Let 's see if we can hone in on it . ( crowd clamoring ) Get out of the way ! Man : We 're running out of water ! ( clamoring continues ) Man : Let people in ! We need water ! Angie ! Where have you been ? Rose ! ( panting ) Are you okay ? ( crying ) ( panting ) : Junior , he ... What ? Junior what ? The day that the dome came down , Junior locked me in his fallout shelter . ( whispers ) : What ? ! I tried to escape , but I couldn 't . And then big jim found me . And he let you out . No . He locked me in again . Big jim did ? And the only reason He let me out this morning is because ... He thought this missile was gonna kill us all . I can 't believe big jim would do something like that . Rose , I 'm not lying . When he finally let me out , I ... I ran . I ran and I ran to my parents ' house . ( sobbing ) : I couldn 't find joe . Oh ... I couldn 't find my brother ! Oh . Your brother is safe . And so are you . ( sniffles ) But junior 's a cop now . And his dad 's a councilman . Who 's gonna believe my word against theirs ? I do . I do . Don 't you worry , honey , 'cause we 'll make sure that everybody else does , too . Are you sure a diabetic lives here ? Yeah . Name 's on the medical files I pulled . Ray garcia . 341 cupidas drive . Yeah , well , no one 's home . ( sighs ) Can we come back later ? Joe , we don 't want them to be home . Plus , maybe they got caught outside the dome . Wait , wait , norrie , we-we can 't just ... ( shotgun racks ) What are you kids doing ? My mom needs insulin . So you figured you 'd steal mine ? She 's ... She 's gonna die . Just like the rest of us . I took my last dose yesterday . Now , go on . Get out of here before I blow your damn heads off . ( crowd clamoring ) they 're gonna run out of food ! Let 's go ! Back up ! Move ! Can 't wait any longer ! Let 's go ! No , no , no , no ! Hey , hey , hey , come on , stop ! Hey ! Stop ! Let her go ! No ! Get your hands off ! Hey ! Get your hands off that woman ! Go to hell ! ( grunts ) Move it ! Move it ! ( panting ) ( muffled grunting ) Linda : Barbie ! Barbie ... Get ahold of yourself . ( clamoring continues in distance ) Can I count on you ? ( panting ) : It won 't happen again . All right , this thing is starting to spread . We need to do something , and fast . Carter , come with me . ( glass shattering in distance ) ( clamoring continues outside ) ( loud banging , glass shattering ) What the hell do you think you 're doing ? We know that you still got meat In that freezer of yours . Yeah . And it doesn 't belong to either of you . You don 't get it , rose . We 're stuck in here with no water . Food 's running out . A bomb couldn 't even crack that damn thing . So we 're just gonna take what we want . Right after you kiss my ass ! ( rose grunts ) rose ! ( bat thumps , rose grunts ) Rose ! Rose ! ( angle yelling ) You bastard ! ( angle screams ) ( siren wailing ) ( tires screech ) Where have you been ? At the station . I remembered duke telling me about some riot gear The feds sent us after 9 / 11 . This is it ? This stuff 's ... It 's ten years old- - it loses effectiveness . Get ready to clear the crowd . ( crowd clamoring , glass shattering ) Man : Move out of the way ! Look out ! Run ! ( people coughing ) Barbie : The tear gas isn 't working . It 's not stopping them . ( clamoring continues ) ( glass shatters ) Dodee : Slow down , slow down . Damn it ! Now what ? I lost the signal . ( sighs ) : How ? I don 't know . Just-just give me A second . Wait , wait , wait , It 's back . Hurry , hurry , go . Okay . We 're close . All right . Door 's unlocked- - It 's not like we 're breaking in . Now say it like you mean it . Nore ? What are you doing here ? We were just ... Um ... Where are your parents ? Mom went to the store . Dad can 't get back home with that dome thing outside . We 're not gonna hurt you . I 'm not scared . Mom says I 'm not a little boy anymore . I even do my own shots now . You have diabetes ? Yeah , but it 's not a big deal . Take these back to the fridge . Wait . Woman : What the hell are you doing here ? Get out ! I 'm sorry . That was a stupid idea . You were right . Let 's just go back to your mom 's . Julia : Hey , joe ! What are you guys doing here ? Uh ... We were just ... Out on a walk . What are you guys doing ? ( rapid beeping ) wild goose hunt . The signal 's coming from right here . ( rapid beeping continues ) From this house ? I think it 's coming from them . What 's this ? It 's my end of the deal . Got what you want , ollie . So be prepared for town folk to start coming over , Getting their water . ( laughs ) Well , it 's a good start , anyway . Need another delivery about a week from now . You know , I could always seize that well , You backwoods son of a bitch . And I 'm sure you 'd find some bylaw Or loophole to justify doing it . I mean , that 's always been the big jim way , hasn 't it ? But not anymore . What 's that supposed to mean ? It means I don 't give a rat 's ass What piece of official paper you pull out . You step foot on my land except to bring me more propane , You 'll get a bullet between the eyes . I always could shoot better than you . Be careful , ollie . Times like this , you don 't want to stand alone . Cross me . We 'll see who stands where . ( laughs ) yeah , junior 's girl really put up a fight . She can 't now . ( clamoring continues outside ) Go watch the door , clint . Angie mcalister . I don 't think you 're gonna mind . ( clamoring continues outside ) ( glass shatters in distance ) Joe : Wait , this is our fault ? So you think we 're what 's jammig All the frequencies in town ? All we know is , whatever this signal thing is , It started today and it led us straight To you guys . Yeah , but why today ? I mean , it 's not like we did anything . I know it doesn 't make any sense . It sort of does . We have to tell someone . Dodee : Tell us what ? The day the dome came down ... We both started having seizures . All the people who 've seen us seize ... Have said that we said something . The exact same thing . Okay , I 'm officially freaked out . H-here . ( sniffs ) Both : The pink stars are falling in lines . The pink stars are falling . The pink stars are falling . The pink stars are falling in lines . The pink stars are falling . The pink stars are falling . The pink stars are fall ... ( clamoring continues ) Barbie : Hey ! Break it up ! Clint : Sorry , man , diner 's closed . When did rose make you the doorman ? ( chuckles ) Rose ? Yeah . Waylon ! Get out of there ! Hey ! ( strained grunting ) ( weak groaning ) ( whimpers weakly ) ( panting ) ( waylon coughing ) ( panting ) ( glass shatters in distance ) What happened ? Rose is dead . Rose ? Oh , my god . I need your keys . I got to get her to the clinic . Linda : Damn it . Someone slashed the tires . It 's time for rule number two . Stop . Stop ! ( thunder crashes ) ( clamoring stops ) ( thunder rumbling ) ( horn honking ) Man : It can rain ! It can rain inside the dome ! ( crowd whooping , cheering ) All right ! Don 't just stand there , folks , grab a bucket , grab a trash can ! We need to save every drop we can ! Now , come on ! Hey , I got to get her to the clinic . Is that angle mcalister ? What happened ? Barbie : Looters . They broke in To the diner , they knocked her out . And rose ... What about rose ? She 's dead . These two guys . One kept calling the other one ... Waylon ? Sounds like the dundee brothers . Find them . ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) ( electrical crackling ) Dome 's still here . Outside it 's totally dry . How is it only raining in here ? The dome must have its own microclimate . The water from the lake evaporates , But the dome traps it inside . But the beautiful thing about the evaporation process Is it filters the water so you can drink it . Guess we 're not gonna run out of water after all . Yeah , great . So now we can spend the rest of our lives Inside this damn thing . ( electrical crackle ) whoa ! ( song playing over radio ) Radio 's working again . Whatever was jamming the airwaves is gone . ( song continues ) That 's because joe and norrie touched the dome together . What the hell does that mean ? You know what , I don 't have time for this . I 've got to get to my mom . I 'll drive you . No . The clinic 's not far . I 'll walk . You come with . ( song continues over radio ) They 're connected to it . It 's like the dome is ... Using them . Okay . How ? I don 't know yet . We could have died today in that missile strike . And instead , the dome ended up protecting us . And just when we need water ... It rains . I mean , this can 't just be a coincidence . Okay , so what , now the dome 's helping us ? Maybe . Maybe it 's trying to reassure us . First it traps us ... Now it 's trying to reassure us . No . No , there 's nothing warm and fuzzy about this , julia . And we need to tell someone about them . Big jim 's gonna know what to do . Do you have any idea What will happen if word gets out about those kids ? The whole town will be after them . Until we know what this is , we can 't tell anyone . Fine . For now . ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) ( steady beeping ) ( thunder crashes ) ( monitor continues beeping steadily ) Carolyn : I don 't know how you guys came up with this But I 'm glad you did . When she needs her next dose ? Let 's just be happy she 's better for now . ( whispers ) : Okay . ♪ ( horn honks twice ) Barbie . I 've been looking for you . You okay ? Yeah . You okay ? Yeah . It 's , uh ... It 's been a hell of a crazy day . Yeah , I guess you could say Everybody went a little crazy today . We 're gonna be okay . ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) ( thunder crashes ) ( groans weakly ) ( exhales ) ( quiet whistling ) ( weakly ) : Hello ? Big jim : I 'd take it easy if I were you . ( gasps ) ( groans ) ( panting ) : What ... What is going on ? Barbie found you knocked out in the diner . Rose ... ( groans ) : She needs help . I 'm , uh , I 'm afraid it 's too late . She was a good friend to me . What ... What am I doing here ? You can 't lock me up again . No , no , the front door 's open ; you can leave anytime you like . Though I was Hoping ... That you and I could ... Come to an arrangement . Junior kidnapped me . No amount of money can pay for that . You 'll get no argument from me . You know , deep down ... I think I always knew something was off ... With my son . Ever since his mom died . I guess I just ... Couldn 't admit it to myself . So I 'm not talking about Giving you money . I 'm offering you my word . Your word ? Junior rennie will never touch you again ; I 'll make sure of it . And , uh , well , I mean , if ... If you need money ... Or ... What counts as money In town these days- - you know , propane , Food , water , A gun- - Well , you 'll have it . If you will just try to Put this terrible event behind you I 'll get you anything your little heart desires . What about joe ? I need to know that my brother will be taken care of , too . Done . We can be friends . And , uh ... Trust me , Times like these , It 's good to have a friend like ... Big jim rennie . I don 't know . I have to think about it . ( door opens ) Dad . Angie .

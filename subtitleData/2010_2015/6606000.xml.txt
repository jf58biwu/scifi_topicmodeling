 Clarke , voice-over : I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For 3 generations , The Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive , but now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind , 100 prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested by the earth , by the secrets it hides , and most of all by each other . Previously on " The 100 " ... Ark Station , please come in . We need you . Are you saying there are survivors on the ground ? Yes . The earth is survivable . Finn : The grounder saved Octavia 's life , and Bellamy brought him back here and tortured him . My name is Lincoln . Let 's go . With the grounder escaping , we should expect retaliation . Jaha : We are going to the ground , but not all of us are . There are 2,237 people on this ark , and there are only enough dropships to carry 700 . Jaha : My friends , this is an historic Unity Day . Every year , we mark the moment our ancestors of the 12 stations joined to form The Ark , but this is the last time we do so while aboard her . Next year , on the ground . [ Applause ] Right . After we did all the work . Someone shut him up . You shut up , Miller . No one 's forcing you to watch . Jaha : For 97 years , we have eked out an existence , hoping that someday our descendants would return to earth ... Don 't tell me you don 't like Unity Day . Unity Day is a lie . The Ark only came together after the 13th Station was blown out of the sky . Just not the version of history we like to tell each other at parties . The Unity Day story gives people hope , though , and peace came out of that violence . Yeah , but did there need to be violence at all ? Jasper : Whoo ! Yeah ! Monty strikes again ! Hey ! Call this batch unity juice ! Who 's thirsty ? Monty ! There you go . Hey . Save me some . [ Indistinct chatter ] Happy Unity Day . Pass it around . To our sons and daughters on earth listening to this message , we will see you soon . The first Exodus ship will launch in under 60 hours , carrying you the reinforcements that you need , so stay strong . Help is on the way . Hello , Abby . Diana . We have seen the true soul of our people . I hope there are no hard feelings about me taking the council seat . No hard feelings about anything at all today . That 's right . You 'll be able to see your daughter soon . But enough from me . You are all here for the pageant anyway , right ? He 's cutting his remarks short . What 's that ? Oh , nothing . I helped him with his speech . He 's leaving the best part out . Without further ado , I present the story of us . They tell me you 'll be on the first Exodus ship . Yes . I 'm overseeing security on the ground . Will you take the tree down for me ? Mom , I have job to do . Well , at least come to the departure ceremony . You could give the traveler 's blessing . Think of it as a good-bye gift for your mother . I don 't remember it . Excuse me . [ Fanfare ] Girl : Long ago when the earth was on fire , 12 stations floated through space all alone . Then one day , Mir floated by Shenzhen , and they realized life would be better together . The other stations saw this , and they wanted to be together , too . When all the stations were joined , they called themselves ... [ people screaming ] [ High-pitched ringing ] [ Muffled voices ] Daddy ? I 'll go and find and your daddy . Jaha , are you ok ? [ Screaming ] Get him to medical now ! Kane ! Find out who did this ! Mom . Mom , mom . Abby : We need triage supplies now ! Man : Dr. Griffin , we need your help over here . In peace , may you leave the shore . In love , may you find the next . Safe passage on your travels until our final journey to the ground . May we meet again . Marcus ... I 'm so sorry . We need to get you out of here . Sir . This was a coup . Councilors Cole , Kaplan , Muir , and Fuji are dead . If you hadn 't cut your speech short ... Where 's Councilor Sydney ? She left before the blast . I 'll find her . You do that , and double the guard at the dropship . I 'm putting The Ark on lockdown ! Aah ! We are not missing that launch window . They suspect it was you . The way I see it , we got two choices ... stay and fight , in which case maybe we win if we can get enough workers to join us . And if we don 't , what 's the second choice ? Take the Exodus ship now . It 's not ready . Can our engineers get it ready ? To charge the batteries on a ship that size without causing a disruption to The Ark takes time . Then cause disruptions . It 'll get cold . With the lockdown , even they find a way to isolate the lesser populated stations , people will die . So there 's casualties either way . Take the Exodus ship . We should have built a bigger bomb . [ Indistinct chatter ] Hey . The comms are still dead . They cut out during the pageant . Best Unity Day ever . Do you really think now is a good time to be having a party ? I mean , the grounder is out there . grounders . By now , he 's made it home . He 's probably putting together a lynch mob . Relax . I got security covered . Why don 't you go get a drink ? You look like you could use one . I could use more than one . Then have more than one . Clarke , the Exodus ship carrying your mother comes down here in two days . After that , the party 's over . Have some fun while you still can . You deserve it . Yeah . Ok . So do you by the way . I 'll have my fun when the grounders come . All right . Unity Day . Making bullets on Unity Day . The grounders don 't know it 's Unity Day . How did Bellamy get you to help ? I volunteered . We have to be ready to fight , right ? Or we could try talking to them . They seem to prefer stabbing . Violence is the only thing those people understand . You know , they could say the same thing about us . If we keep going on this way , we 'll never stop digging graves . You didn 't see him , Finn . It didn 't matter what we did to him . He was ready to let you die . He was protecting himself . Why are you defending him ? Never mind . Hope you know what you 're doing . I know what I 'm doing . Better ? We 'll make a warrior out of you yet . Octavia : Finn ? ! Lincoln , wait , wait ! He 's my friend . I think you lost this . So what the hell are you doing here ? I could ask you the same thing . I could also ask how long you 've known he speaks English , but I won 't . You blew this when your people were hunting us . You saved our lives . I have to believe there 's more like you . I stabbed you . And we tortured you . If the two of us can get along , the maybe there 's hope . Learn from history instead of repeating it , right ? How 's that gonna happen ? For starters , no more killing . I don 't have the power to call a truce . Then bring me to someone who does . Hey , look . The rest of our people are coming down here . The first ship lands in two days . It 's true . And because of the attacks , they 're sending mostly soldiers , the people that enforce our laws . The Ark is about survival at any cost , and they 'll kill people who fall out of line . When those people get down here if they feel threatened , they will start a war , and I don 't want that . Neither do you , and I think that 's why you blew that horn . Once the soldiers get here , it will be too late , and we 'll have no power to stop them , but if they see that we 're at peace , then maybe we have a chance to stay that way . All right . You bring your leader , I 'll bring mine . What ... Bellamy ? He 'll never go for this . No . Not your brother Clarke . Man : Check . Make sure everything 's cleared out . Different man : All right . It 's clear back here . Sir , the dropship 's clear . We did a full security sweep . Ok , boys and girls . Play time 's over . Back to work . Let 's get this ship ready to launch . I should be in medical , not packing first-aid supplies . The injured have been taken care of , and we can do nothing for the dead . Marcus . I 'm sorry . Vera was an amazing spirit . Sydney : This launch should be delayed at least until you 've questioned the terrorist that set that bomb . I put word out to my people and just heard back . His name is Cuyler Ridley . He 's a mechanic who lost his wife in the culling . Yeah . I recognize him . So what makes you think he did it ? He turned himself in . Where have you been , Diana ? Why did you leave the pageant early ? Well , thank God I did , or I 'd be dead right now . I guess we 're both lucky . Stay where we can find you . Where am I gonna go , Kane ? Be careful . Ridley 's dangerous . [ Cheering ] Clarke : You 're not gonna get this one . Yes , I am . No . It 's not happening . Whoo ! All right . What do you know ? Her highness can actually party . I like it . So what are you gonna do when the guard come down and Commandeer Monty 's still ? Build another . All right . You ready ? Oh . No . Wait . I have done this before , I promise . What is it ? Let 's take a walk . Sorry . Did something happen ? I need you to come with me , but I can 't tell you why , ok ? Finn , tell my why . Hey . Don 't . I set up a meeting with The grounders . A meeting ? I don 't understand . With who ? How ? I was just with the grounder that we had in the dropship . His name is Lincoln . Wait a second . He spoke to you ? It 's not important . If we want to live in peace ... Finn , we can 't live in peace with people who 've done nothing but kill us . Can you think of a better way to stop the bloodshed ? Yeah . With the guns that the guard bring down . You really want a war ? Because at this rate , that 's what 's coming . Look . I know it 's a long shot , but this is our world now , and I think we can do better than the first time around . I trust him . I don 't . But if we go , we have to bring backup . No way . We 're not bringing guns . Those weren 't the terms , and if we 're gonna do this , we got to give it a fair shot . Ok . Ok . I 'll ... I 'll get my pack , and I 'll meet you at the gate . Ok . Hey . I need to talk to you . Having fun yet , princess ? I 'm serious . You always are , so talk . Finn 's set up a meeting with The grounders . I 'm leaving to go talk to them . Because you figure that impaling people on Spears is code for " let 's be friends " ? Have you lost your damn mind ? I think it might be worth a shot . I mean , we do have to live with these people . They 'll probably gut you , string you up as a warning . Well , that 's why I 'm here . I need you to follow us , be our backup . Does Finn know about this ? Finn doesn 't need to know , and , Bellamy , bring guns . Hey , hey ! There you are . All right . Listen . We 're playing drunkball . I bet Monroe my team 's gonna win the Unity Day title . That 's for you . I know you Zero-G mechs have crazy hand-eye skills , so , huh ? What do you think ? It 's got to be more fun than whatever you 're doing . I 'm checking the gunpowder in these rounds so that if The grounders try to kill us all maybe we can get a few shots off beforehand . Hmm . That 's intense . Sure you know what you 're doing ? Why does everyone keep asking me ... Oh , whoa ! Damn ! You need now that , you know , you almost blew one off ? I got this . Hey . No one 's a better mechanic , all right , but this stuff requires a chemist . How 'd you do in chemistry class ? Hmm . Ahh . Well , the fates are smiling upon you , my friend . I was great in chemistry . Hmm . Ooh ! Nope . Oh , it 's gassed off . Pretty sure the acidic smell means that the gunpowder 's degraded . Better start a dud pile . You know , when my parents get here , they can mix us up some new gunpowder . My dad 's gonna flip for this scrap metal . " My kingdom for a soda can . " Heh . That 's what he always used to say . How about you ? Got any family ? Nope . Just Finn . Well , we all got each other now , right ? Jasper , you 're coming with me . I am ? You handled yourself well in the cave with the grounder . I mean , I hit him in the head . If you 're planning on shooting anything , you better think twice . I haven 't checked those yet . Give me some bullets that work . What do you need them for ? Your boyfriend 's being an idiot . I 'm coming with you . We should get Clarke . Clarke 's with Finn , isn 't she ? [ Sighs ] Clarke : I 'd love it if you were right about this , but did you ever consider it might be a trap ? Yep , but since it 's Unity Day , I decided to have hope instead . Unh . Clarke : Oh ! Hey . Let me have a look at that . [ Sighs ] Seriously , Finn , you 're putting a lot of faith in a guy who stuck a knife if you . And you 're sounding more and more like Bellamy . I 'm just trying to keep us alive . So am I. At least they 're good for something . Jasper : Sorry about bringing up Clarke earlier . That was awkward . Shut up . Both of you shut up . Keep your eyes open . You were seen planting the bomb , Ridley . You killed 6 people . Should have been 7 . Jaha 's lucky he cut his speech short . I know you 're upset about what happened at section 17 . I lost my wife . You 're damn right I 'm upset , but this is about more than the culling . Workers all over The Ark are tired of getting screwed . It 's our kids you sent to die on earth , and who 's on the first dropship ? Not us . Over and over , Jaha and rest of you on the council betray our trust . Today is your reckoning . Tell me ... Who helped you ? I know you didn 't act alone . You don 't know Jack . You still think this is just about the chancellor . Unh ! Unh ! Ridley : There goes the power . That 's our cue . Leave him . He 's gonna die in here anyway . What 's happened ? I 'm not sure , but we 've lost power to multiple stations ... Farm , Hydra , Mecha . Now we can vent in breathable air , but the temperature in those sections is falling fast . People are gonna freeze to death . Lift the lockdown and evacuate those stations . Where 's Kane ? He 's interrogating the bomber . Sir ... Power 's out in prison station . [ Shivering ] Marcus ! It 's a mutiny . Diana Sydney ... She 's ... She 's diverting power . She 's taking the Exodus ship . [ Beeping ] Red : Whoa , whoa ! Whoa ! What the hell are you doing ? This is our ship now . Chancellor on deck . How many of our people are on board ? Less than 50 % , ma 'am . They 're all upstairs on the passenger deck . Tell me about the cargo . Nearly all here . Search all the decks . Throw anyone not loyal to us out of the service hatches and back into The Ark . Lieutenant , you may give the order . Seal the doors , begin the launch protocol . We 're t-minus 5 and counting . Sydney : Let him go ! He 's made his choice . He 'll warn Jaha . That hardly matters now . This Exodus ship belongs to all of you . You 're the future of the human race , and today , I 'm going to lead you home . So that 's how you set this up . You helped him escape , didn 't you ? I trust him , Clarke . There 's a lot of that going around . Someone 's coming . What 's Octavia doing here ? Oh . I guess we know how he got away . [ Hoofbeats ] Wait . Look . [ Neighing ] Oh , my God . Horses ! Hey . We said no weapons . I was told there wouldn 't be . It 's too late now . She goes alone . I 'll be fine . Clarke ... Hey . It 's time to do better . Your name is Clarke ? Yes . I 'm Anya . I think we got off to a rough start , but we want to find a way to live together in peace . I understand . You started a war that you don 't know how to end . What ? No . We didn 't start anything . You attacked us for no reason . No reason ? The missiles you launched burned a village to the ground . The flares ? No . That was a signal meant for our families . We had no idea ... You 're invaders . Your ship landed in our territory . We didn 't know anyone was here . We thought the ground was uninhabited . You knew were here when you sent an armed raiding party to capture one of us and torture him . These are all acts of war . I see your point . That 's why we need to put an end to all of this . Red : I told you . It happened very fast . I 'm not even sure if Dr. Griffin was inside at the time . I 'm sorry . Sinclair : Sir , the Exodus ship is fully charged , and they 've begun their launch protocol . It won 't launch when the door 's open , that 's correct ? It is . Then get the damn door open . We can 't . It 's already pressurized , and we can only open it from the inside . Keep trying ! How long until launch ? Two minutes . Jaha : Diana , open the door ! Sitrep forthcoming , ma 'am . We should be ready for launch momentarily . Upper levels clear ? Ok . Complete the sweep - and secure the hatches . - Man : Yes , sir ! Assume flight positions . Hey ! What are you doing ? Jaha : Abby ? Diana , don 't do this . It 's already done . Get her out of here . Wait . We could use a doctor on the ground . Come with us . You owe Jaha no loyalty . He 's killed your husband and betrayed you . You 're just like us . Think of your daughter , Abby . You can see Clarke again today . I 'm nothing like you . Man : Whoa ! Whoa ! Unh ! Abby ! Red : I got my pry bar in ! Somebody get me a Jack ! Anya : Lincoln said there are more of you coming down , warriors . The guard , yes , but also farmers , doctors , engineers . We can help each other but not if we 're at war . Can you promise that these new arrivals won 't attack us , that they 'll respect the terms you and I agree on ? I promise I will do everything I can to convince them to honor the terms that we set . Why would I agree to an alliance that your people can break the moment they get here ? grounder Princess looks pissed . Our princess has that effect . If you fire the first shot , those people coming down won 't bother negotiating . Our technology ... They will wipe you out . They wouldn 't be first to try . Oh , no . No . This is bad . What the hell are you talking about ? There 's grounders in the trees . What ? Where ? Are you sure ? I don 't see anything . They 're gonna shoot ! Clarke , run ! Run ! Clarke , get down ! Finn , get back ! Go , go ! [ Click , click ] Unh ! Oh , my God ! Lincoln ! You 've been hit . It 's just a scratch . Unh ! Ok . Run . Don 't stop till you get behind your walls . Go ! Take her ! Lincoln , no ! Go ! I got the Jack ! Where 's Abby ? Send her through ! Sydney : I will if you let the doors close . No , no , no . They haven 't decoupled ! What does that mean ? It means the dropship 's still tied into all of our major systems ... power , water , air . If it launches , The Ark will be crippled , and everyone left on board will die . Kane : Can we do it from our side ? Yes , but it takes hours , and they 're not waiting ! Diana , please ! You don 't want to be remembered like this . I won 't be because you brought this on yourself , Jaha . You promised the people truth , and all you gave them were lies ! You had me shot ! You detonated a bomb in a public meeting , killing 6 innocent people , and now you want to kill everyone on this space station to satisfy your ego ? He is still lying to your face . There aren 't enough dropships to get everyone down to the ground . What is she talking about ? [ Indistinct chatter ] Trust me , we will figure this out . We will survive , we always do ! Go ! Come on ! Sydney : You can 't trust him . More than 1,000 people , most of them workers like you , are gonna be left behind to die . You can still save yourself . I don 't trust either of you . Sinclair : We 've lost the main power generator . But I 'm going to the ground ! No ! Launch ! Sirs , we have to go right now ! Everybody out ! Get back behind the containment doors . Go , go , go ! Please , sir . [ Alarm blaring ] You got something to say ? Yeah . I told you no guns ! I told you we couldn 't trust The grounders . I was right . Why didn 't you tell me what you were up to ? I tried , but you were too busy making bullets for your gun . You 're lucky she brought that ! They came there to kill you , Finn . You don 't know that . Jasper fired the first shot ! You ruined everything . I saved you ! You 're welcome . Well , if we weren 't at war already , we sure as hell are now . You didn 't have to trust The grounders . You just had to trust me . Like I said , best Unity Day ever . [ Explosion ] The Exodus ship ? Your mom 's early . Wait . Too fast . No parachute ? Something 's wrong . - Encoded by ★ L @ ♫ BerT ★ -

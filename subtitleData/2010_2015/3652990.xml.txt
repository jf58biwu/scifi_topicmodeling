 Previously on Caprica ... You wonder what they would think if they knew that you stolen my chip and killed two of my men . My company 's future is the product of a crime . I got to hand it Vergis ... that 's an elegant design . You swore that vergis would never find out . - About the MCP ? - He knows . I 'm here to buy the Caprica City Bucaneers . It 's your dream . My dream is to tear up your dream . Welcome to New Cap City . What 's the object of the game ? It 's a mystery . It 's almost like figuring out the object of the game is the object of the game . I thought my daughter was gone forever . Tamara sent me . Look , she 's in V-world , and she can 't get out . My daughter 's dead . She died in the Maglev attack . Stop ! Who 's this ? That 's what I want you to figure out . I need you to find this kid . I 'd do anything to help my friend , even enlist the help of terrorists from the STO . You 're going to Gemenon . You have to take me there in the robot body . You chickened out once , Lacy . I have to go to Gemenon and take Zoe 's package with me . I can maybe set up a meeting with Barnabas . Lacy , you 're asking for my assistance , yet you 're not telling me what I 'm getting myself into . I 'm hatching my own plan to escape from the lab . 12 planets , and no one woman is interested in me . - I 'm ... I 'm Philomon . - I 'm Rachel from V-match . I feel like there is a be inside this machine , something alive . There is a brilliant mind in here . I 'm getting closer to finding the Zoe Graystone avatar . It 's called a swipe drive . So if Zoe 's program were on a computer , - and we used that . - We would have it . We would be able to recreate the living Zoe avatar . Hey , wake up . Why ? Because Nestor and I were up all night going over the information you pulled off Daniel Graystone 's computer . The avatar program was there . - So we have it ? - No . At some point it was downloaded off of it into another device . Well , if it was downloaded , then it 's somewhere , and if it 's somewhere , we can have our resurrection . It 's gonna be okay . Daniel Graystone moved it to another device . He knows where it is . Amanda Graystone goes to the memorial every morning . I think she could do with a shoulder to cry on , poor little thing . Excuse me , what are you doing ? We 're not gonna hurt anything . We 're just relocating these things . No , no , no . No , you can 't . You can 't that . Where are you going ? All these memorials will be just like they were , only set up down at Appolo Park . No , but the people died here , they died here . They 're building a permanent shelter there . But you can 't ... you can 't do this . Excuse me . This isn 't ... this is not right . This isn 't right . Amanda , what 's going on ? Let 's get your faces on camera . Okay , you know what ? Put that away , please . Sister , step aside , please . You put your hands on person of cloth ? This is sacred ground ! All right , you know what ? Come on , let 's go . It 's not worth it . Yeah , go with the gods . Go on . Go ! You don 't want to be recognized here . Come on , let 's go . Come on . It 's just like they did with Zoe 's things , you know ... clearing them all away , out of sight . Sorry , it 's ... it 's probably not even my place to say . What is it ? You don 't ... you look so pale . I thought I saw someone back there . Never mind . It 's nothing , really . I thought I saw my broth Darius . But whatever I thought I saw , I know that I didn 't . And I can 't ... 'cause Darius is dead . Lacy , I need you to meet me in the VIP room right now . Zoe , I 'm sorry . Have you been waiting long ? No , it 's just ... you 're not gonna believe what happened . Sister Clarice was in my dad 's lab snooping around . She looked me right in my eye . Well , do you think she knows it 's you ? No but ... but she was definitely looking for me , that 's for sure . She was messing with my dad 's computer . I mean , that 's just way too close . Look , make sure that Barnabas knows , I 'm gonna need a big box , okay ? Don 't even give him a hint of anything that 's gonna ... What ? What 's wrong ? Nothing . Everything 's good . Lacy , my part of the plan is getting the robot out of Daniel 's lab , okay ? And I 'm already getting it done . I already have another date with cute lab boy . - Do you like him ? - It 's not relevant . Your part is getting us to Gemenon , okay ? And one is pointless without the other . Look , I just told you everything 's okay . I can do it . It just ... I need more time . You have to trust me . I have never let you down . Oh , right . Original Zoe wanted me to get on that train , not you . I have never let you down . Hey , hey , hey , hey , hey . What are you doing there , Tad ? Just tossing them . No , no , no . Now , down when you place ... Hey , tell that guy no standing around . Go . Excuse me sir , the , uh ... the entrance to the store is around front . That 's all right . Take me in . Uh . No , no , I can 't . - I don 't ... - What ? really want anything to do with this . Dead people shouldn 't have avatars . Tamara 's not dead . What ? No , that 's not true , 'cause you 're the one ... She did die in the Maglev attack . But now you 've seen her in the virtual world . The avatar you saw , is my daughter . Only I don 't know enough to find her on my own . You 've got to help . You 've got to help her . For the gods ' sakes , please . You call yourself a photographer , and this is the best you can do . Lousy . So how much further to this new crap ? - It 's New Cap . - Yeah , as in New Cap City . And still ways to go , okay , Joseph ? So this New Cap , it 's a part of V-world ? Yeah , only it 's like a game . And that 's where Tamara is , right ? You better hope she 's still in there . If she 's walking around the rest of V-world , it 's gonna be frakkin ' impossible . Well , if Tamara told you she 'd be in the game , that 's where she 'll stay until I find her . She 's smart . She 's an Adama . Okay . Is this it ? Is this New Cap City ? I think we need to go over some ground rules . Your avatar 's code , it 's like genetic code . Once you die , the game will ban you for life . No matter how many hacks you try , you cannot get back in . And your hopes of finding your daughter ... well , they die with you . That 's a small gun . It 's fine , okay ? Try not to die . What the frak ? I really think you need a bigger gun . Coming through . Excuse me , I 'm a doctor . Back away , back away ! Okay . Did anyone see what happened ? And all it needs is , like , a tasteful ribbon , around the neck of the bottle , like ... like this . Do you know how much that bottle costs ? Desire will kill you . I just need to spend some time with Amanda Graystone . She sees people who aren 't there . So ? Amanda is the mother of Zoe , and Zoe is the mother of life everlasting . There is a connection . This is a sign . God is using these women to speak to me . And I have to listen . Where the hell are we going ? Can 't we just ... can 't we just fly ? - Yeah , sure , man . Fly ? - Yeah . All right , sure . Yeah , I was just waiting for the right moment . Okay . Okay , no just ... All right , spread your arms out in front of you . Okay , now , get your chin up to the sky . You 're gonna want to be careful , that when you take off , you don 't over-correct and slam into the building . Now , it 's really easy to hit the building , okay ? - Just take a deep breath . - Ready . All right , and ... What are you , an idiot , man ? No , we can 't fly . It 's a non fantasy game . Frak ! Come on , man get with the program . If you can 't do it in real life , then you can 't do it in a non-fantasy world . No one has superpowers . No one can fly . Hey , listen , so the rules in here are just like in the real world ? - Right . - Well , that 's no fun . What kind of world is that ? It 's the kind of world where you can shoot someone in the head without going to jail ... Frak fifty women in one night without taking vinagro ... how about that ? Really ? You 're gonna do just fine . Just remember not to die . Remember not to die . Guess what I found . Scorpion marsh genuine ambrosia ? I thought I saw him again . Your brother ? Uhuh . There was a crash in the city ... and I saw him there . I don 't understand . My brother died in a car crash . And I was at the scene of another crash today , and I saw him there , so I chased him . - Chased him ? - Yeah . It must have been quite a sight ... crazy lady chasing a ghost . But then he vanished into a parking garage . And ... this was there . Oh ... That 's where it happened . What ? The accident . That 's ... where the accident happened . Are you sure ? Yeah , I 'm sure . I was in the car . That 's where my brother was killed . That just must have been terrible . It was terrible . The trauma and ... therapy and talking and ... more therapy and more talking . And finally . Some really good drugs ... The strong ones . Oh , I shouldn 't mix . I won 't tell . Because you 're my friend . If you 're ready to meet the love of your life , try V-Match . Is Daniel Graystone to blame for his company 's recent stock tumble ? - Jack , your take . - Thumble is putting it mildly . Graystone Industries is in a free fall . So is the entire tech sector . Graystone plays long ball . He 'll be back . This limited-edition version of the Graystone OS-9 holoband is unsurpassed in quality . No shot ... centaurs win possession . How come the Bucs are only a ten-point favorite ? It might take more than two wins in a row to start thinking juggernaut . Hey . I had court-side seats , thought I 'd stop by , say hello . You 're not allowed here . Well , it 's all a question of timing , don 't you think ? No , I don 't . Cyrus Xander , I have been wanting to meet you ... - No , listen , listen ... - Who decorated this place ? I 'm not gonna keep playing this social dance with you . - You threaten me ! - Are we dancing ? We 're not dancing . You ' leaving . Sean ? I think that you 're gonna want to hear this . I don 't think I do . Well , there 's a rumor on the street , that you only have one working MCP . - What ? - But the thing is , I don 't think it 's true . I don 't think you have a working MCP . - That 's not true . - Why would you think that ? Because the working MCP you have is the one that you stole from me , and that one ... never worked . - Score and a foul ! - Hey , someone scored . Yes . Fantastic . Sell me the team , Daniel . You 're running out of options . No shot ... centaurs ... Get his picture to security . I don 't want to see him here again . The stolen MCP works perfectly . What 's he talking about ? I can 't believe that Barnabas won 't help me . He might help you if you told him what you had to take to Gemenon . We , he can 't know that . No one can know that . I made a promise to Zoe . Zoe 's not around . Ok , are you sure that ... Yeah , I am . - There has to be another way . I have to get to Gemenon . - Why ? Because you can be a monotheist there and have no one care ? He won 't help you unless you 're STO . Simple , then ... I 'll become STO . That 's a big deal , Lace . Come on , Keon . I know you 're worried about me , but I can handle it ... Especially if you 're there with me . Tackle by May ! No , no , you don 't understand . This is good . This ... this could be really good . No , it 's really not ... He doesn 't believe the MCP works . He 's no wonder he thought we were desperate to sell . We are desperate to sell . We have an incredible robot , a thinking ... - We have one . - And anticipating ... - We have one ! - Sentient super soldier . The military is figuring that out . When we can 't deliver on our scheduled demos , they 're gonna pull the contract . We need time . Vergis' money can buy us time . He thinks we have nothing . We have something . - We can crush him with that . - How ? - I will crush him . - Seriously , Daniel ... Time-out , centaurs ! The company is overextended . And the only thing that can bring in the kind of money we need is selling this team . I mean , the board can force you to sell . I will not let him take my team from me , ever . Is that clear ? No .. Screw the game , I got work to do . Tandem flying on a first date ? Thank the gods that there 's an autopilot in this thing . Seriously , Philomon , you are such a geek . Come on , Rachel , let 's see what you can do . Let 's have some fun . Turn off the autopilot and follow me . All right , but I don 't know how to fly a viper . Tweak your skill set . Just be a fighter pilot , like me . Oh , ah , right ... be a pilot . Wait . Oh , hey , okay . Watch it . Wait , what am I gonna do ? Everything is flashing . Pull up . Pull up . Pull up , Rachel . Frak ! Frak ! Philo , help . What am I supposed to do ? Eject ! Eject ! Whoa , whoa . What ? Listen , listen . Come on , it 's not safe here . Come on . - What ? What is it ? - It 's a dirigible . - Now , come on ! - What ? Oh , sh ... Holy ... ! Run ! Frak ! What the frak were you thinking , man ? Watch where you 're frakkin ' going ! - I 'm sorry . - You 're sorry . - I 'm so sorry . - I 'm frakking dead now ! You know what that means , right ? I can 't go back ! So frak you . You 're on your own now . I can 't believe ... I can build you a new one . Are you gonna tell me now why you didn 't just make yourself a better pilot ? Yeah , well , I set my avatar so I could acquire skills naturally . That way , V-world would be more like real life . Well , I like the way you think . Yeah , well ... V-World piss me off a lot of the time . The way people see this place as an excuse to cut corners or drop out life or ... or do things they know are wrong but just because they 're in here , makes it not wrong anymore . You don 't sound like much of a computer geek . I just think there are better things to do with our technology . Like , maybe in V-World , w ... we should extend life . Extend life . You mean like , make it so we could somehow actually live here ? Yeah , well , it 's not quite there yet . It 's still too fakey-fakey . I mean , look at the sky . And look at that tree . All right , it 's exactly identical to that one over there . Maybe someone didn 't want to program a million different trees . That 's just it . That 's not the way to do it . Living systems use generative algorithms . With a generative model , the system would use a ... basic generative kernel of a tree . And pow ! An infinite variety of tree like trees . I work with top-secret military robots . That 's really hot . He shoots , he scores ! Frakkin ' Holcott slipping past Jacob Kovat ... and this is a major disappointment for Kovat and the Buccaneers , with their layoff hopes slipping away . You know I hate watching them lose . Off . Kovat is pathetic this season . Listen , um , you want some dinner ? I 'd love some , but , uh , I just have too much to do . Vergis is circling again . Still thinks he can snake the team away from me . Okay , well , I hope you told him to go frak himself . Yes , dear , but he 's offering my board all the cash they can eat . And since our profits are in a downward spiral because of me , it 's a little complicated . What 's this ? A gift . We think that there 's only 11 bottles of that in the entire 12 worlds . Here , try it . It 's ... very good . I know I 've been working too hard lately . I 'll ... I 'll take some time off soon . Ok ? Yeah . - Serge , sustenance . - Yes , Daniel . It 's gonna be a long night . Hey , wait a minute , who 's " we " ? Who gave you that bottle ? A friend . Should I be jealous ? I 'm not sure . Well ... let me know ... dear . You know ... if you were to program a robot using a generative model like ... like something in nature ... It could benefit from modulatory input , and like living in the real world . And those inputs would be different every time . I mean , each robot would be unique and ... uncopyable . That 's not really my point . My point is that a robot could benefit from being in the real world . You know , let it out , explore , - get it out of the lab . - No , no , no ... Uncopyable ... Cause it 's analog . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . Mmm , thank you . Hey , am I catching you a bad time ? No . No , no , no . It 's good . Would you be interested in , um ... going out night , doing something fun ? Yeah . - I 'm actually at the dive . - Really ? You know that place I was telling you about ? Yeah , no , I remember . I ... I could be game . Hi , hello . Sorry , I was just on my ... on my break . You know , we have a critical deadline to meet and only one working MCP . It might be good if you were a bit more focused . Yeah . Yes ... yes , sir . Actually , sir , I 've , uh ... - I 've got an idea . - I 've got food on the way . You and I are going to start all over with this body thing . Yeah . No , yeah , my idea is that ... Look , we 've be treating the MCP like it 's digital ... because it supposed to be . So we expect to be able to reproduce a perfect copy . But what if something in the MCP ... is analog ? Like a person created through a generative process , there 's no way we 'd be able to make a perfect copy of that and that is exactly what 's happening . Essentially ... a tiny difference would make a difference . Have you identified anything analog or hybrid digital-analog ? No . It 's just a theory . You can go home now . Leave me your notes . I 'll take over . Generative process ... like a human system . Tamara ! You know that , that is strong stuff , that purple . Be careful . Yeah , I know . I remember . I 'm just bracing myself for th .. - For ? - For this . Oops . This . You know the old saying , " all of this has happened before , and all of it will happen again " ? Delphi convalescent institute . But it 's just ... a form letter requesting a donation . This is the place . Delphi convalescent institute . Am I , am I missing something ? I was there for two and a half years . The accident . Two and a half years ... Were your injuries that severe ? No . No , that 's ... that 's not what this hospital is . I went here , to Delphi , three years after the accident ... when I was having trouble ... coping with reality . I went crazy . Frak ! Don 't move . - Okay . - Don 't even think about trying to get your hands up - and de-rezzing . - Okay I 'm faster than you can think . Please don 't kill me . - I have to stay alive . - Don 't we all ? Who are you ? I go by Emmanuelle . What do you want from me ? It 's not what I want . It 's what you need . You need a guide to find your daughter . * * * said you were easy to find . Look for the cube wandering all alone . You know , I 'm amazed you made it this far . All right ... If you 're a guide , then start guiding . Oh , I will ... Just as soon as we discuss how much it will cost you . Clarice , I saw that . I saw your face . I saw that . You 're joking , right ? No , I 'm not . I 'm serious , I lost it . I lost my frakkin ' mind . I was seeing my dead brother everywhere . Yeah . Poor thing . I dropped out of college . I dropped out of life , actually . I ... spent the first six months chasing after my dead brother down hallways ... some real ... some imaginary . Yeah , you know ... they say ... that surviving is the punishment for leaving things left unsaid . Yeah , well , who said that ? I mean , what kind of vile person would say that ? I don 't know who said it . Maybe I made it up . But it 's true . It 's true . I left so much unsaid . There were so many things that I didn 't say , and I wasted so much time . And then he died .. and I was left . That 's my punishment . That 's my punishment . This all is my punishment . - Amanda , listen to me ... - This is what I get . Listen to me . God does not want you to punish yourself . He loves you unconditionally . He made you in his image . We don 't know the reasons why when he takes those that we love , like Darius , or ... or Zoe . We just have to give ourselves over to his final judgment . We have to trust in his wisdom . And if you can learn how to do that , then you 're gonna be free from ... from all the pain of these terrible years . Now , you ... just have to ... trust him , Amanda . Trust god . Which god ? Which one ? Which god do I trust ? This way . What is it ? If I die in here , I 'll lose the chance to ever see my daughter again . Then don 't die . Generative process ... like a human system . Shh ! Get ... get out of here . Caesar , go ! You 're good . You won 't work for Vergis ... but you 'll work for me . Get out of here .

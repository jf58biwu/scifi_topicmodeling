 I 'm here to see Grigore . I 'm expected . Go on out the back . Whoa . Hell of a warm welcome , making me wait for you outside . What do you want ? Well , you said if I ever had more . AB negative . Only one in a hundred . Is that supposed to make it taste better ? Rare is always valuable . Isn 't that what the people say ? People say a lot of stupid things . Thank you . Don 't snort it all at once . You know , for such a rare blood type , you have little trouble obtaining it . I guess . That 's what makes me your source . My friends here believe you are the source . They can taste that stuff in your blood . If that 's true , why buy the cow when you can drink the blood for free , hm ? " NIGHTBREAKERS - VAMPIRE NATION " Today marks the end of the myth . Our new reality is that vampires live amongst us . And I , Constantin Kovaks , have been named head of the Department of Human Vampyre Relations in accordance with our government 's wish to foster a genuine symbiotic situation . When we reach this historic scientific conclusion , the synthetic blood will allow vampires and humans to finally live together in peace . After years of unsuccessful coexistence , the Romanian government has made the unilateral decision to cast all vampires to Sector Five . I find it outrageous that this could happen in this day and age . We are now not only subjugating these people , but quarantining them into what amounts to a modern day internment camp , only one with horrific living conditions . So let me ask you , how long before Sector Five becomes an outright concentration camp ? Hey , the sooner the better if you ask me . The fact they even refer to these things as people is frankly offensive . They 're an affront to God and everything we stand for . I don 't think for one minute they wouldn 't do the same to us if they had half a chance . As long as people continue to think like you do , there will never be a lasting peace . Now , I want you to listen to me , and listen good . Humans and vampires will never live in peace . It goes against the natural order of things . Make no mistake , it 's us or them . Which side are you on ? Keep your id 's out . To the left. lD 's out . Right . I had it . I just had it . There a problem ? - Yeah , my ID . I just ... Well , no one gets in without ID . - I know , I know . I just ... Step out of line , please . I 've got it . I take your trash twice a day . I deserve your respect . No one gets in without ID , so move along . I said move along . Ah , Lieutenant Derricks . You look like you just spent an hour with my wife . We 've got a situation developing in Sector 5 . Clearly you do not know my wife . I meant to say you look terrible . Yeah , I got that . - Palinka ? It 's not even nine-thirty . It 's synthetic . - Then what 's the point ? Three vampires and one blood dealer wound up dead last night in Ferentari . Anyone I know ? No . Well , then it would seem the situation has resolved itself . It looks like they were ripped to pieces . This is making me reconsider my breakfast . You know , whatever did this couldn 't have been a normal vamp . It sure as hell wasn 't human . Last Monday . Last Thursday . Same M.O. , same district . You 're saying there 's things out there worse than vampires ? We only have learned that vampires exist in the last ten years . Who knows what else might be out there . I 'll wait . No , no , come . Detective Derricks , Lieutenant lnnes-Bunchley . First from Scotland Yard . I want him to ride along with you on this one . Yeah , no . - What , he 's perfectly qualified . I 'm perfectly qualified . No offense Bumcheese , but I need someone a little crazier . Someone who won 't flinch at this . Harker . Give me Harker and his team . That 's ... Oh , yes . Harke r ? Yeah , the Vampirdzhiya . Vampire hunters . You know , the next attacks could be on someone you actually give a damn about . Shit . Okay . Okay , take the savage . But you 're taking him as well . Fine . Alright . Hey , freaky giant guy . You 're not even that big . What are you , like two-eighty ? Two-ninety ? Fine . You 're probably more like three-ten . Anyone ever tell you you talk too much ? Yeah , but I probably wasn 't listening . What was it you were saying about ... Hey . Well , I 'm glad you could join us , John . Harker . John 's my toilet 's name . So what 'd you do to piss off the big guy ? Would you believe it was over a sandwich ? Vampirdzhiya , right ? Am I pronouncing that right ? Well , I 'm Lieutenant Derricks , and this is Lieutenant lnnes-Bumstead , and we 're here ... What ? Sorry , in his what ? It 's Bunchley. lnnes-Bunchley . Anyway , we 're here to offer you a way out of this hell hole . Call it work release . We know the Vampirdzhiya have certain skills . You want us to hunt vampires . Not exactly . Something out there is already doing that . So what do you want from us , then ? Well , I would like you to help me stop it . Why would we want to do that ? Because it 's not just blood suckers that are being killed . It 's because I can get you transferred back to America . But mainly , because you 're good at killing things . It 's what you do . My sister , too . Or no deal . All right ? Told you . Matter of time . Thank you . - Don 't thank me yet . We done ? Couple of stops we need to make first . We don 't have time for this . Actually , we do . It won 't be dark for another hour yet . Which means it 's still happy hour . They got a point , bumbly . You boys got this , right ? We cannot turn in an expense report for the nightclub Kama Sutra . Reckon you owe me that for the past two years . What can I get for you guys ? Whatever they want . Uh , beer . Round . And , um ... So what are we doing here , Harker ? Please tell me the last member of your fabled bunch isn 't a prostitute . She 's not a prostitute . She 's a dancer . The hours are better . So , tell me . How 's a cop from the East Coast end up in Eastern Europe ? Same way most Americans do . Married a local . How 'd that work out ? Still here . We definitely can 't drink on duty , guys . You got a lot to learn about being in Eastern Europe , Bumlick . Bunchley . lnnes-Bunchley . - What ? To still being here . Katya . You went out for ice cream and it took you two years to come back ? What can I say ? I eat slow . Champagne Room . Save my seat . The Champagne Room ? We can 't expense that . Foreplay . Nice . I like it . Two years , Johnny . You couldn 't find a way of letting me know you were all right ? Or even alive ? A vamp could have killed you in there for all I know . You keep the vamps separate , Kat . You know that . Listen to me . I thought about you . Not enough to write . I couldn 't write . It might have lead ' em straight to you . You had a phone call , Johnny . Everyone gets a phone call . Yeah , but how would I know you were safe after ? So what are you doing here now ? Making sure you are safe . Look , I know things have been bad . Bad is what things were like when you went in . Things now , they 're worse than ever . I 'm stuck here night after night , too scared to even go home at night . Why didn 't you just leave ? Get the hell out of Bucharest ? I knew I 'd never see you again . And you never woulda had a chance to slap me , right ? Not in the mood for a lap dance ? Bumbledor gave me one in the car . Uh , he 's more the kinda guy that would stay home with the wife . Feel better ? Like new . Kat 's up to speed , so we 're ready when you are . What ? She 's part of the crew ? Why else do you think we 're here ? You know it 's work . You can expense that . Let me guess , Harker family reunion . When I heard you were out , I had a sudden craving to see you . Is that supposed to scare me ? It 's okay . Marius here , he 's all talk . Hardly put up a fight the last time we met . Do you think we 'll let you walk freely after what you did ? He served his time . Now take a step back . Killed my father . You mean the sick bastard that turned you ... Show yourself in our district and we 'll bleed you dry . Yeah ? You come near me again . And you 'll what ? Sick your slut on me ? I 'm sorry , what ? She didn 't tell you . Your girl has been making enemies since you left . Keep talking , Marius . I swear to God I will rip your head off and stick it right up your ... Okay , I 'm a cop , so try to cool it on the death threats . Keep working with him , and my kind will turn on you . Derricks ! Derricks ! Bouncers are missing . There 's blood . And I don 't suppose you know anything about that ? You 're ours , Harker . You and your merry band . Go . You know I released you on one condition . That leech just killed two people We don 't know that . Hey , low-profile . How 's this for low-profile ? Semi-automatic , nine millimeter , hollow points . Not bad . Haven 't told you the best part , mercury tips . Mercury ? The vapor in the bulb . - Yeah . To them it 's poison . To us it 's poison . I thought it 's always silver , vampires ' weakness ? What do you think they called mercury back in the day ? Quicksilver . Shoot ' em with enough of these , they 'll boil out from the inside . So what else you have in there ? - We should go . Yeah , I 'm driving . Keys . - What ? Great . It seems Harker and his friends are back to their old tricks . We should tell Nikolai . Listen . Aleksandr . Hey , we 're just here for information , not to get vampire blood on the hands . Yeah , yeah , I get it . You should know that those things in there , they don 't care you 're a cop . To them , blood is blood . Okay ? We need to speak to whoever 's in charge . Back of the line , bleeders . This is official police business . I know your people can 't hear for crap , so let me try again . You 're not on the list . I 'd check again . Didn 't you read the sign outside ? No soliciting . We 're not selling Girl Scout cookies . We just want to talk . Surrender your weapons . You won 't be harmed , you have my word . Don 't trust him . You force your way into our house at gunpoint with the Vampirdzhiya . Give me a reason to trust you . We 're not giving up our guns . Yeah we are . Remember why we 're here . All of you . Do it . I think I prefer being in prison . Just you . Harker , too . Trust me , he 's better where I can keep an eye on him . How old is this place ? Older than Bucuresti itself . Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda . Older than the Kazikle Voyvoda . The " impaler Prince ... Vlad the Impaler . And his Ordinul Draculya . " Order of the Dragon ... Dracula ? So who does that make you , then ? I am Anghel . I had the honor to serve during the Carpathian Campaign . My father is six hundred years old . Dude , you don 't look a day over two-fifty . You better have good reason for bringing humans here . For bringing him here . Three vampires were killed last night , torn limb from limb . They were buying human blood on the black market . The past week , there 's been easily a dozen murders , both human and vampire . Though , from the look on both your faces , this isn 't news . What isn 't news to us , Detective , is that human police don 't care about crimes against vampires , but now that humans are also being targeted , here you are . I believe the distribution of this black market blood has led to certain impurities . I don 't follow . A contaminated blood sample has spread through our people not unlike one of your sexually transmitted diseases . The infected appear to be turning into a primitive subspecies , acting only on their most primal urges , turning our genes against us . Like some kind of retrovirus . So , what are you saying exactly ? I think they 're saying there 's life-size vampire bats flying around Bucharest , sucking it dry . I guess that 's where I come in . Vampire metabolism is already must faster than a human 's , but these vampire bats , as you call them , their needs are much higher . Their blood thirst , insatiable . One of my own sons has gone missing . I fear he has fallen into their ranks . So how do we stop ' em ? You can 't , human . Oh , and you can ? We are somewhat limited by our nocturnal tendencies , but you can track these creatures during the day while they slumber . Of course , they 'll tear you apart if you do . Yeah . We 'll take our chances . We should work together . What ? That is not what I signed up for . You signed up to kill vampires , and as far as I can tell , these are about as pure vampire as they get . I do not wish them killed . You must understand we don 't have any choice . Nikolai will help you find them if you will help us try to save them . Good luck , Detective Derricks . It 's not part of the deal . We work alone . Actually , you work for me now . We don 't need them . Wait , is that you ? Fire of eighteen forty-seven . Humans burnt down half the city . That was the last time we revealed ourselves . Jury 's still out if things will be any different this time around . Vanatorii Umane . It 's time . Vanatorii Umane ? Human hunters . Not all humans , just the ones you brought with you . Don 't worry , Detective . They 're off the clock . Where 's Marius ? Find him . Found him . I 'm sorry . I brought them here . Get out ! Harke r ! Hey ! Hey ! Faster metabolism apparently means they die faster . Nice . Thanks . Don 't mention it . What are you doing ? He could lead us to the others . Aleksandr ? That 's not Aleksandr anymore . Brother , we only want to help you . No ! I told you we wanted him alive . Tracking bullet . You should have said so . How do we track him ? - Equipment 's back at the ... Where ? Your hide out ? No . No . We are not taking them back there . Why not ? You already know where we live . That 's not the same and you know it . The hell it 's not . If we 're working together , we 're working together . Good thinking using that tracking bullet . Good thinking using that tracking bullet . I expected a bit more . It 's no six hundred-year old disco . Looks like he 's moving along Rahovei through Ferentari . If he removes the tracking dart ? No , transmitters are already his blood stream . Not bad . At least you 're bringing something to the table . So , uh , who pays for all this ? We bought stock in SanguiTech . Pharmaceutical company behind the synth blood ? We got in early . And no , the irony 's not lost on me . So where are we with our guy ? He stopped moving somewhere here , in the sewers below the processing plant in Rahova . That 's where their colony must be . When you say " colony , " how many do you think there are ? Hard to say . Well how many of you are missing ? Right , hard to say . You still don 't want us knowing how many of you there actually are . You 're still getting used to the idea that you know about us at all . Let 's just say there may be more of them out there . A lot more . Okay . We should gear up , get back out . Not until sunrise . Not if you want to survive . I guess patience isn 't one of your virtues , Harker . Well , it 's definitely one of yours . I mean , without us you 'd be still sipping on cocktails waiting for someone else to find your brother for you . Don 't worry about it , leech . They won 't be the first vampires I 've enjoyed killing , just the ugliest . Don 't think I didn 't see what happened back at the club . You might not have killed Marius , but you may as well have . Once this so-called alliance is over , you and I are going to discuss it . Really ? Why wait ? Okay , okay . We may have some time to kill , but let 's not kill each other , yeah ? What ? He started it . Some slumber party . Did you think we slept upside-down , hanging from the rafters ? Those things 'll kill you . You really need to worry ? What happened to getting some rest ? I guess I 'm just restless . I can see that . So your ex , what 's the story there ? What makes you think there 's a story ? She got sick a few years ago . Doctors didn 't give her long . I was desperate . I knew she 'd say no , so I didn 't give her a choice . You had her turned ? I knew she 'd object , so I did it while she slept . She woke up a vampire . She 's out there somewhere . You 'll find her . You know , the thing is , I wouldn 't even know what to say to her if I did . I 'm sure you will . That 's real , isn 't it ? Can I ask you something ? Why do you hate the vampires so much ? Is that a real question ? You could have left town , like so many others . People shouldn 't have to leave their own cities . They shouldn 't have to live in fear . Are you frightened of me ? Yes . Good . Is this okay , us talking like this ? Like what ? You know , like a couple of people . We are a couple of people . No , I know . That 's not what I meant . It 's just ... I know . Hey . Hey . What 's it like out there ? If I didn 't know better , I 'd say your sister 's flirting with Nikolai . - What ? I 'm sure they 're just passing time . Perfect . I don 't know about you , but I could use a shower . You coming ? Derricks has involved the vampires . They 're moving on the sewers at sunrise . Understood . I 'll make sure . The signal stopped moving four hundred meters south by southwest . Well , this is nice . We got enough C-Four to take out half of Sector Five . But , I 'm sure it won 't come to that . Remember , we want Aleksandr alive . I 'll take the lead . - Nikolai ... You can 't see in the dark . - That 's why we have flashlights . What am I here for , then ? Bitching , apparently . Fine . By all means . A hundred meters this way . I 'm sorry . I can smell them . Means they can smell us , too . From here on out , silence . Flashlights off . Harke r ? Wait . My brother is in here . Let me find him first . What about the rest of them ? Plant your charges , but give me the detonator . Come on . Come on ! Okay , come on . Okay , okay . Go , go , 90 - Come on ! Go ! Go , go , go ! They 're getting through ! Fire in the hole ! They 're giving UP - They 'll be back , once they find another way around . Okay , we get outta here while we still can . No . - No ? You saw the size of that colony . There were hundreds of them . This is our chance to wipe ' em all out at once . He 's right , Harker . If we leave now , they 'll move the colony before we get back . We must detonate the explosives . You 're the one that dropped the damn thing . You go get it . Unless it wasn 't an accident . We don 't need the detonator . We just need someone to get close enough to blow one of the C-Four bricks . Blowing one of the bricks will set off a chain reaction to take out the rest of them , too . This has the biggest range . Who 's our best shot ? My eyesight is twice as sensitive as yours . How do we even know you 're gonna take the shot ? Harker ? - Just cover me . How close you need to get ? - The door . At that distance you 're going to blow yourself up . Let 's just get him to the door . I can 't get a clean shot . We need that detonator . Let 's clear a path . Follow up on me . Go . Brother . No . Know what you 're doing ? Everyone out ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Andrei ? Harker , just go ! Something 's blocking the door ! Anytime , Harker ! It 's stuck ! Here ! Go ! She 's gone . They 're all gone . I couldn 't save any of them . Aleksandr is gone . He gave his life for us . That proves he died your brother and not one of those things . You need to stop hurting yourself and cover up . Harke r ? He 's a dead man . He will pay for what he did to Andrei , I promise . But right now we need him alive . Harke r ! You better lock him up somewhere I can 't find him . What is the meaning of this ? - You tell me . Lieutenant ? He was waiting for us . As we took out the colony , he was waiting to trap us in there with those creatures . Vampires are a disease ! They have no business living amongst us . It wasn 't just the vampires , was it ? I was in there . Please , please , please , please . Get him out of here . Okay . Well , this will be an embarrassment to the department . People are dead because of him ! I think we can both use one of these ? Someone must be responsible for the tainted blood . Tainted blood ? The black market blood . Some of it 's tainted and infected with something that alters the vampires ' DNA , turns them into these full-on monsters . Damn blood dealer . Now killing the infected won 't stop others from getting sick or - or changing . We need to find the source . And who knows if that was even the only colony . Colony ? There are colonies ? Unless the poor bastard downstairs is the last . You brought one here ? The examination room , yeah . I gotta tell ya , he 's a little crispy . Ah , well . Good work , Detective . I think any loose ends can wait till tomorrow . Uh , get some rest . Eh , one last thing , what of the Vampirdzhiya ? They 're still under my watch , just in case . Okay . I 'm gonna take a shower . - I 'm taking a nap . No , there 's no time . There 's not long till sundown . What are you talking about ? Johnny , no . Wait , what are you talking about ? He wants to go back to Nikolai 's nightclub . What ? Why ? That crypt is one of the largest in Bucharest . It could be connected to a dozen more , for all we know . But we do know this much , where we can hit ' em where it 's gonna hurt . After everything we 've been through ? Okay , Celeste . Shoot . What have we been through that 's been so life-altering ? Two years in a cell , Johnny . It gave me a long time to think . Well , did you think about what Dad would say if he found out that you were falling for one of them ? Huh ? Do you think that 'd give him some sort of comfort while he was visiting Mom 's grave ? 'N . I 'm with Celeste . Nothing 's clear anymore . Have you looked around lately ? There 's more of them every single day . More and more humans will continue to go over to their side until one day there will be nobody left on ours . Look , we 've all had a long couple of days ... Don 't . Do I need to remind you , they know we know where they live . We know where they live . And now , they know where we live . Hey , look at me . Too scared to go home at night . That 's what you said . Do you really wanna go on living like that ? No . Do you ever sleep , Detective ? After today , I 'm not so sure . It 's a dark one . You shoulda seen him before he got the tan . What can you tell us about it ? This thing represents a complete regression of the vampire genome . The question is , what triggered it ? The infected blood sample ? If this were an isolated case , sure . But for it to spread to so many , so quickly , this outbreak must have had more than one original carrier . In fact , I 'm even inclined to say that this is no accident at all . It 's more like a large scale demonstration of some kind ... Excuse me . Derricks . Derricks , Derricks , he 's out of control . You 've got to stop him . Whoa , Celeste , slow down . Start over . Johnny and Kat are on their way to Nikolai 's . What , Why ? Well , why do you think ? Well , why didn 't you stop them ? They tied me to a chair for my own good . All right , I 'm on it . - Derricks , there 's more . Well do I even wanna know ? I 'm pretty sure half the city 's about to come under siege . What are you talking about ? There are more of them than we thought , Derricks . A lot more . Hang on . You 're gonna wanna hear this , Celeste Harker . Celeste , you 're on speakerphone . As you were saying , there 's a lot more of these ? A lot more . At least half a dozen colonies across Sector Five , just like the one we saw today . No , that 's impossible . I 'm seeing massive movement beneath the city streets . We 've got hundreds of those things descending on Rahova . Okay Celeste , thank you . Hang tight . Look . Every advantage vampires have speed , strength , hearing , even the paralytic agent in their saliva this guy had in spades . This guy had in spades . So if there really are hundreds of these things out there . We need to order an evacuation . I think perhaps you are delirious from fatigue . What did you not hear her ? I cannot order an evacuation of Bucharest and incite a panic ... Not the entire city . Not the entire city , no , but Rahova , Ferentari . There are ten thousand people at least still living there , and easily twice that many vampires . You have a point . Would you excuse us , please ? If what Miss Harker says is true , I think this represents an opportunity for us to rid the city of these creatures before they spread to more densely populated areas . Thirty thousand vampires and vagrants . Small price to pay , don 't you think ? Harker 's still out there . He 's my responsibility . Him and his sister . I 'm gonna bring him in . If you feel you must . Detective , just be careful . We don 't have to do this . Then what are we doing ? Are we not still the Vampirdzhiya ? Have you forgotten why we do this ? We were scared back then . We both lost people close to us . Yeah . What 's changed ? I have to do this . Even without you . It was supposed to be a cure . But it wasn 't , was it ? It was a virus , and you went forward anyway . Different means , same end . To rid the world of vampires ? Do you know what I see when I look out that window , Detective ? Fear . I see a city paralyzed by fear . And now there are reports of vampires in London , Budapest , Prague , Barcelona . Make no mistake , they are spreading . They are the virus . They represent the end of everything we have built . Everything we know . Surely you must see that . We are going to take back our country . But it never was your country , was it ? Vlad the Impaler was a damn vampire . I knew it was a risk to put you on this case . I need to know where you stand in regard to these monsters . My wife is one of these monsters . Yes , she is . I am sorry for you . Detective , please . If it 's any consolation , I will make sure you are here with your friends when it all goes down . This isn 't the Romanian Revolution , Kovaks . Isn 't it , though ? Take down Detective Derricks . I repeat , take down Detective Derricks . You ? Why are you helping me ? I saw you at the club last night . You were with Nikolai and the others . Open the door now . If I don 't make it out of here , you 've got to give Anghel a message . The synth blood is contaminated . Kovaks and whoever he 's working with are behind it . They 're the reason his son is dead . Tell him yourself , just go through a window . Go ! They won 't show you any mercy . And I won 't show them any . They gotta be down below , sleeping . Really , Harker ? Too predictable . Yeah , you might get us in a rush , but not before we take most of you with us , and your crypt . Shame it has come to this . It didn 't have to , you know . You would 've done the same , eventually . There 's still a way out of this , for both of you . You gotta be kidding me , right ? It 's your choice , Harker . Join us , or die . But either way , I 'm gonna turn your sister , and she 's gonna like it . Try doing it from the next life . Harker ! Been out of jail now for what , thirty-six hours ? Are you really in that much of a hurry to die ? What ? You forget what side you 're on ? The only side you 've been on Johnny is your own . Human , vampire , you want it to be that simple , but it 's not . Now lower your weapons . Lower your weapons . Now shut your mouth for five damn minutes . If you still want to die , I 'll shoot you myself . No need to be so rude about it . You too . Give me five minutes before your Vanatorii Umane do anything drastic . Why should I ? Because what I 'm about to tell your father changes everything , and I don 't want my team killing each other in the meantime . You know the way , Detective . It pleases me to see you alive . Pleases me as well . Anghel ... Nikolai told me you did everything you could . Even so , I 'm sorry . Did you learn anything ? You could say that . Tell me everything you know . Peacekeepers in place . The complex is locked down . Derricks nearly ruined our plans , but in the end , he simply accelerated our time table . Now , we wait . These are disturbing developments , but not entirely surprising . Kovaks is willing to sit back and sacrifice hundreds of humans just to turn public against you . We have to expose the truth . What we need to do is warn people . Humans , and vampires alike . Otherwise it won 't even matter . Once again , I am in your debt . I 'm just doin ' my job . Nevertheless , allow me to do something for you . Cass , is that really you ? Hello , again . You look ... The same ? Is this , um ... Do you live here ? It doesn 't exactly work like that with us . I drive through Ferentari every night , past the vampires , and the blood dealers , and the homeless . I 've seen your face a thousand times , but it was never you . How can you be sure ? What I did to you , was unforgiveable . But that doesn 't mean I don 't want you to forgive me . I want to thank you . No . I was selfish . I just didn 't want to lose you , and I still lost you anyway . You never lost me , Terry . And you 'll never have to . I just don 't know if that life 's for me . I know . But , think about it . You know where to find rne now . What have we done ? We didn 't do this , Kovaks did . All units , all units , we have multiple disturbances in Rahova , Ferentari , Odai . Please respond . Half the city 's under siege , where do we even start ? Celeste . - Celeste . We 're quicker on foot from here . HEY' 'bout time you have a real weapon . Come on ! This is almost fun ! I 'm starting to not hate you as much ! Just so you know , the feeling 's not mutual . Good . Come on ! Come on you bastards . Is that all you got ? Whoa , what about my hug ? Oh , I 'm sorry Johnny , I almost forgot . What are you , psychotic ? First of all , ow . And secondly ... I could have been killed ! You 're fine . There 's something you need to see . Whoa , what is that ? Those are the blood transmitters we 've injected into Aleksandr . They 've been passed on exponentially . Wait , you 're telling me that each one of these is a vampire bat ? They 're being drawn into the heart of Ferentari . Vamp central . - Why ? Some kind of ultrasonic signal , but here 's the interesting part . The signal is only being relayed there . It 's actually originating here . The Vampire Relations building ? - Someone 's doing this on purpose . That son of a bitch isn 't just letting it happen , he 's making it happen . We have to stop that signal before this thing turns into a massacre . We need to get in there tonight . Well I can get us in there , but getting out , now that might be tricky . By now , Kovaks will have the entire complex locked down tight . He 'll have snipers on the rooftops in case any vampire bats get too close . Peacekeepers will be at the entrance . The signal emitter should be on the rooftop along with more guards , but the moment we break in , they 'll activate the UV lights . That 's going to be a problem . That 's why we 're going to cut power to the entire city grid . So no one can see ? They can . Turn out the lights and we 'll have the upper hand , but like everything else , the vampire bats will have the same advantage , only more so . We 're going to need backup on this one . A lot of it . You 'll have it . So , whaddya think ? Hell , I should be in prison right now anyway . Why not ? I believe they 're here . Masks down ! Don 't worry , they 're just unconscious . I can hear their heartbeats . The control room should be right up ahead . That 's where we shut down the signal . I think we 've got a problem . I 'm seeing a lot of movement . Tell me that 's not what I think it is . Transmitter must need full power to operate , and since we cut primary power to the building . The vampire bats are all coming here now , and fast . Then let 's get that signal shut off , then , sooner rather than later . Can you shut it down ? Got it . Wait . If I don 't press this button right now , every two hundred pound vampire bat in Bucharest is gonna be here in the new few minutes . Exactly . Even for you , Harker , you 're not making a lot of sense . Let 's say we shut off the signal . What then ? The bats leave , we survive . I got a better idea . We blow the building . That way they 're all in the same place at the same time . This is how we end it . Tonight . Are we really considering this ? Well , we wouldn 't have to blow the entire building . Just the transmitter on the roof . That 's actually not bad , Harker . So ... how do we do this , exactly ? With a little luck , and a lot of C-Four . Kat ! I 'm a little busy here , Johnny ! You appear to have brought some new friends with you this time . You had to know the truth will come out . Of course . So genocide was something you wanted on your resume . Is it really genocide when the survival of one 's own species is at stake ? Or simply self-preservation ? Either way , that 's not for you to decide . Hey guys ? Go ahead , Celeste . Uh , we got another problem . This is bigger than you or me , Detective . Much , much bigger . Kat ! Katya ! John , we have to go . Yeah . When the main power came back on , so did the transmitter relay . It 's sending the bats back downtown . You can 't shut it off ? Not without the code . You can 't threaten me . You know I would rather die than fail . They 're not mutually exclusive , by the way . The code , Kovaks . Now . You know , sometimes we have to make decisions for others for their own good . Don 't you agree , Detective ? Oh , by the way , how is your wife ? I made a choice , and I 've had to live with that , but that 's got nothing to do with this . Well , I think we should find out . No ! I 'm not going to shoot anyone else . I have made my point . What point ? She 's dying . No , there 's gotta be something we can do . There is . No . No , there 's got to be something else . A hospital or something we can help her ! Celeste , Celeste , talk to me ! Celeste ! Whoa , Harker , Harker . Wait . Think . We need him . We 're losing her . What do I do ? You can 't make that decision for her . Johnny ... Hey . Celeste , tell me what I should do . Celeste . Save her . Save her . Please . Your body 's healing itself . You 're weak , but you 'll be fine . Johnny ... Sorry . I couldn 't stand to lose you . You have nothing to be sorry for . As I said , my point is made . Is it so wrong to choose life ? No , and therein lies the dilemma . If they survive , we do not . If that 's the way it 's gonna go down , so be it . Perhaps . But I will let history be the judge of me , not you . It 's all right , I 'm fine . You may not be scared of dying , but you are scared of one thing becoming one of us . You wouldn 't . The code , Kovaks , or become what you hate . Okay . Okay . It 's working . The bats are doubling back again towards the roof . What are you doing ? What is this ? A choice . There 's enough C-Four on the roof of this building to vaporize the top three floors . Hey Harker , remind me , what floor are we on ? Top floor , boss . So like I was saying , that there in your hand is a detonator , which you 'll probably want to press once this place is crawling with those things you helped create , or if you really want to make a statement , don 't press it . Just let the monsters eat you alive and you 'll have high schools named after you and people will know you died for a cause you truly believe in . And how do you know I won 't press it right now and blow us all to hell ? Because you still think you 're making it out of this alive , and hope can be a real bitch like that . So like I said , you got a choice . You can 't ... Shit . Boss , what happened to you ? Shh ! Keep it down and come over here and get me out of this ! So how did you know ? How could you be sure Kovaks would blow the roof ? Kovaks was a coward . I was pretty sure he 'd take the easy way out . And I had a second detonatorjust in case . Well the next few days should be , urn ... interesting . It 'll probably get worse before it gets better . But vampires and humans will continue living side-by-side . But will it last ? Does anything ? We had better go . I 've seen my last sunrise , haven 't I ? I know Katya would have taken the same deal if she 'd been given the chance . You 're still here and I 'm grateful for that . Bye Johnny . Wait , I 'm coming with you . 'Bout time I said " hey " to my wife .

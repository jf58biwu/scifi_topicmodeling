 It 's time . You have to decide . It 's the only way . Only you can give the order . Dude , make it quick . Back again , are we ? Didn 't expect to see you so soon . Don 't take it personally , but it 's never good to have the police around . After Grant Leetham , are we ? Um ... just spoke to his mother . Apparently he 's missing . There 's nothing new there . Hm ? How many people are in this building ? What , now ? Um ... not many . School 's over . Um ... got four in geology club , Janey 's got this detention , and I 've got a young lad in the gym . What was that ? Your lives as you knew them are over . What the next 48 hours are about is abandoning everything you knew or thought you could rely on , and adjusting to the new reality . So , are the things in Utopia real ? BSE was theirs . - What 's that ? - Comic . Are you going to show me or are you going to be a twat all day ? Keep it under your bed . That 's 77 now dead on the Shetland island of Fetlar . We need a sample of the vaccine . There 's a man in Sheffield , a scientist called Donaldson . Get it to him . It 's me . The manuscript exists . The boy knows where it is . There ' s a woman , works in secret , trusts no-one . - What 's her name ? - Her name 's ... Milner . Right , shall we wait for Jessica ? What for ? can break in . Yeah , can break in as well . Jesus Christ ! Am the only one who can 't break into houses ? We 'll teach you if you want . Ooh , got some bruising here . You 'll have to keep your weight off it . Thanks , Becky , for finding me . You got a boyfriend ? No , haven 't got a boyfriend . You 're well fit. knew you would be . can tell from what you typed . From what you typed , thought you were 24 and drove a Porsche . Will drive a Porsche when I 'm 24 . I 've got a girlfriend , though . Her name 's Alice. met her yesterday . Have you got the manuscript ? Grant , listen to me . It 's very important . need ... we need to ... - Ow ! - I 'm sorry . - Left it somewhere . - Right . When you 're ready , you need to come and tell me , OK ? What 's it like ? It 's ... not what thought . Mean , thought Part Two , it 'd be like a new story . But it ain 't . It 's the same , just ... just different . Like , the scientist is called Carvel . And the ... and the rabbit ? Has he got a name , Grant ? think it began with an L. So , he has had it , then ? mean , he can tell us where it is ? He 's an 11-year-old boy who 's seen someone murdered . Right ? He ... he 's been alone for days . He 's not ready to trust anyone . So , do we give it to Jessica , then ? No way . God knows what she 's up to . We take it to this woman , to Milner . mean , she 's MI5 . We take it to her , we hand it over . - We just get the fuck out of this . - Oh , fuck ! with no mutations to the virus reported for almost 40 years . The Prime Minister is expected to face a call for action at Prime Minister 's Questions today . - Does he have it ? - No . The manuscript ? Look , he 's left it somewhere . He hasn 't said where . - Did you search him ? - We are not searching him ! You want to search this , darlin ' ? Oi , Grant , stop that ! She 's going to have to go through me . - And she thinks that 'll be difficult . - Sit down , Becky . What the fuck 's the matter with you ? And why are you so enthralled with ... ? - Is that Grant ? - What ? This is the image of the boy police believe is responsible ... Why have they got my picture ? The deaths of eight children and two teachers at Bainstow Secondary School , in what police have described as scenes of unparalleled horror . The Prime Minister is expected to make a statement within the next 20 minutes . - But we can confirm ... - That 's not me . that the fingerprints on the gun are those of Grant Leetham , a pupil at the school and the boy identified ... - That is not me ! - - --In these CCTV images . The Leetham family ... This is the image of the boy police believe is responsible for the deaths of eight children and two teachers ... How is he ? He 's pretending he 's OK . He 's ... terrified of what his mum thinks . Christ ! How could they do that ? They faked the CCTV and the fingerprints . It don 't need to stand up in court . They just want to get hold of him . No , mean , how can they actually do it ? How can someone ... ? It 's a handful of kids . So what ? They 've just made Grant the most famous child in this country . The moment he 's picked up , they have him , and all it cost them was a handful of lives . Don 't you get it yet ? That is nothing to them . Death is part of it . Get used to it . Look , Becky , ... Wait , no . - No , it 's not a good idea . - Why ? Won 't your girlfriend allow it ? Is it against orders ? My dad wrote Utopia . never knew him . Not really . Grew up on the run . Learned not to trust people , because you know what ? People always let you down . And they want to sugar-coat it , treat you like a kid . That 's fine for them . They 've been kids . Some of us don 't get to have childhoods . Becky and Ian are great . But they 're not like us . Want you to show me the manuscript . Won 't force you . It 's your choice . But want you to come with me . I 'll keep you safe . You know can . There 's no place for me here . Not now , or ever . We always said this was Bhopal and this was Lake Nyos . 10,000 lives . Don 't feel good being right . Where 's Grant ? # So throw those curtains wide # One day like this ... # You like some shit music . Is this shit ? So , your dad was Mark Dane ? - His real name was Philip Carvel . - What , and you didn 't know him ? They got me out when was about four . Was given to a man called Christos . He looked after me . But he was more like a guard than a dad . He did his best . He taught me how to steal . How to fight . How to survive , really . Was a total bitch to him , but he never got angry . He was amazing . What happened to him ? We were hiding in an old factory and suddenly they turned up . He hid me and ran out at them . They caught him , tortured him , killed him . What , and you saw that ? How old were you ? Ten . Are you hungry ? - What are you doing now ? - Trying to bypass their firewall . It 's MI5 , not Asda . We 're better off hacking into the HMG network and sending her an intranet mail . Wilson , work with computers , know what I 'm doing . You 're an IT consultant , Ian . If want to know how to make a printer work , I 'll let you know . - What are you two doing ? - Trying to get hold of Milner . We 're thinking of sending her some kind of internal mail . The only problem is , is that their firewall is triple-encrypted . Why don 't you just call her ? What ? Just call MI5 ? With a phone ? Yeah . Why not ? What if they 're tracing her calls ? You have 42 seconds before they can put a trace on you . Wilson , how do you know that ? Saw it on Spooks . Right , don 't be on there for more than 30 seconds . I 'll time you . Security Service . Hello . Could ... could speak to Mrs Milner , please ? One moment . They 're putting me through . Hello . Milner . Um ... we 'd like to talk to you . We 're , er ... we 're friends of Jessica Hyde . Who ? Jessica Hyde . Right . Sorry , does she work here ? You don 't know her ? Have no idea who you 're talking about . Can ask , who is this ? Wrong number . She said she 'd never heard of her . Oh , fuck ! That line was monitored . This isn 't . Wherever you are , get out of there right now . Er ... OK . There ' s a chapel on Arbel Lane in Levingstone . It 's always empty . Meet me there - A void CCTV . Get out of there - - Now ! Michael ? Are you OK ? Actually , feel a bit ill , Jen . Could you call in sick for me ? Have you got the shits ? Think so , yeah . Aw , hon ! Well , I 'd love to stay , but you know how hate the weak . Drink plenty of water and I 'll call Bev . Thanks . And no wanking in there . IVF clinic on Friday , you dirty puppy . Ugh . Er ... Professor Donaldson ? Mm ? Mm ? Yes ? You knew Bill Kaye . Sorry . Who ? Bill Kaye . He ... he was a reporter . En " no.No , no . , er ... don 't know any reporters , actually . But he sent me to you . Well , think someone must have had you on . We test pet food . Er ... spot check inspection . It says Department of Health . - You get away from me . - I 'm not one of them . Stay away from me or swear to Christ ... ! My name 's Michael Dugdale . Bill Kaye sent me to you . He must have told you about me . Please ! - You 're Michael Dugdale ? - Yes . Yes , that 's me . Why the fuck didn 't you say so in the first place ? I 've got third-stage heart disease . You should eat better , then . Have you got the vaccine ? No , ... tried . Listen , they 've got Fetlar shut down . Nobody 's getting in or out . No ... no doctors , no specialists , nothing . - It 's all their own people . - You haven 't got it ? Well , isn 't there another way ? Well , not unless you happen to have one of the corpses in your pocket . Look ... look need ... need something on them . You really have no idea who you 're dealing with , do you ? No . That 's why need your help . Do you want to talk about last night ? - Did you like it ? - Of course liked it . Then what 's there to talk about ? You 're such a pain in the ares . As if life isn 't difficult enough . Tell you what . Why don 't we get married , Ian ? Jessica can be my maid of honor . All right . I 'll tell you what . I 'll say it . Like you . There , said it . It 's out . So , now you can punch me or give me a Chinese burn or just ... just kick me in my balls . Reckon you 'd like that . Where 's the other cunt ? Where is the other fucking cunt ? ! Put that down . I 'm gonna ... shoot ... Right ? Cos don 't think you are . Go on , then , shoot me . Cos if you don 't put that down , I 'm gonna shoot you . - Look , please ... - Please ? Please ? I 'm gonna shoot you in the fuckin ' head , mate . I 'm gonna count to three . One ... - Don 't . - ... two ... Did the bullet come out the front ? Did the bullet come out the front of his head ? No , no , it ... it didn 't . - What 's your name , dear ? - Wilson . Well , it 's nice to meet you , Wilson . I 'm Milner . Now , need you to come round here , and fire both barrels of that shotgun into his head . What ? This is a standard issue firearm I 've just signed out from ATC . Need to cover my tracks . He 's already dead . You 're not killing . You 're saving my life . Oh ! Oh , oh . Oh ! Are you OK , Wilson ? Why don 't you let me have that gun ? How do know this isn 't a trap ? How do we ? Look , we 've told you everything we know . We ... we want to ... to come in . Come in ? Ian , there is no " in " . I 'm not MI5 here. can 't protect you . What do we do ? We need to find out why they want the manuscript . Think know . It has the identity of Mr Rabbit . Grant said , but he couldn 't remember the name . That 's it . He 's kept his identity secret for nearly 30 years . That 's why they 're so desperate for the manuscript . He mentioned a girl called Alice , said that that was his girlfriend . OK. can find out if she 's come forward . You need to go there . No , no way . Look , we 're not cops . We 're not spies . This has nothing to do with us . What did Jessica tell you about her father 's ideas , Ian ? On racial purification . What ? He was a fucking Nazi ? Philip Carvel wrote a paper called The Survival Of The Genome , in which he advocated a human cull . This is the same man who became involved with weaponising disease . Right . OK . If you can 't help us , we need to go . Look , can 't do this on my own . This has one number on it , mine . Why come this way round ? You can hold it if you like . - What if they give this room out ? - They won 't . It 's occupied . Can you teach me how to do that ? There 's lots can teach you . What , to be like you ? Would you like that ? You need to change the way you look . Argh ! Ah , no , no , no ! Fucking hell ! Ahh ! Ahh ! That fucking hurt ! We are close , aren 't we , Grant ? To Utopia ? ... need to know we 're moving in the right direction . Initial reports had indicated that everyone who died had an underlying health problem . However , three apparently healthy men in their 20 $ are now known to ... Ah ! No , Jessica ! Ah , that 's my head ! Nice ! - You look cute . - You 're kidding ? Look , you 're making me a fucking Goth ! No ! You 're not putting that on me ! No way ! You 're not putting that on me . No , you " . No , you 're not putting that on me . Grant , just ... just come home . Just go to the police and we ' ll ... we ' ll son ' it out . Or ... or phone your mum up . We ' ll come and get you . Everything ' ll be fine . OK I 'm here . Just please , just ... just ; please , just come home OK ? It 'll be all right . I know ... need to tell her didn 't do it . You know we can 't , Grant . Not yet . Am going to be normal after this ? Let 's drink some booze . There 's a girl in Richmond . Alice Ward . I 'll go . What was like ... as a child ? My earliest memory is ... killing animals . Slaughterhouse . You were there . - Watching . - Arby , please . For as long as can remember , I 've killed . But ... yesterday there was a boy holding these and couldn 't . Arby , don 't . Not now . Not now . Who are my parents ? You don 't have parents . You were part of a consignment from ... Bulgaria , think . Carvel was ... brilliant but he wasn 't kind . Some of the things he did were , by necessity , cruel . What about Jessica Hyde ? Is she like me ? Did he do things to her ? He was not a man of compassion . Lee was killed the other day . Next to you , he 's the person knew most . Why doesn 't that hurt me ? Because you 're not the same as others . You 're special . Don 't feel special . Look mental . Like a fucking Goth . How many of those have you had ? Can ... can have another one ? What 's the manuscript like , Grant ? Amazing . Didn 't read it all . Bits . What about ... What about my dad ? You are going to tell me where it is , Grant , aren 't you ? Cos could make you . Could just make you tell me . Oh , I 'm going to be sick . I 'm sorry . Jessica . I 'm sorry . Want my mum . want my mum . Her name 's Alice Ward . Her mother brought her into Richmond police station yesterday . She 'll be back today . I 'm sending an officer to get her . You need to go to her house . That 's what Jessica will do . Need a reason . Why us ? What difference does it make if we know who Mr Rabbit is ? There 's a story about how he got his name . He was embedded with the criminal underworld in Guangdong . But he was playing everyone off against each other . The Russians , the CIA , the gangs . So , the Americans got fed up and they let a particularly nasty crime boss know that he was their man , and the boss found him , dragged him off the street , right through the middle of a busy office block . They tortured him and , as a lesson to others , the boss carved his own name into this man 's stomach . Rabbit . Have you ever seen the Chinese character for " rabbit " , Ian ? Lots of lines . Lots of cuts . Somehow he managed to get free and , despite being unarmed , he killed everyone in that room . Then he went back through the office block and killed everyone who 'd seen him . By the time he was finished , 265 people on three continents had lost their lives , and not a single living person knew his identity . That 's who Mr Rabbit is . He is the beating heart of all this , and , if we can find his identity , it ends and you go home . Need to get across to Fetlar . Sorry , sir . There 's a quarantine in place . I 'm with the Department of Health . Have a permit of access ... issued by the Minister . Plus , er ... an inter-department waiver , as well as a warrant for inspection . We weren 't told about all this . Look , I 've come all the way from London . I 'm not turning back . Here . You 'll have to call him . - What , phone the Minister ? - Yeah . A couple in here need shifting . Let 's go . Alice , we want to help Grant . Now , the kids at school , they say they saw him with you . We just want to know why they 'd be saying that . Alice , please.just tell him . It 's OK . It takes time . We 've got a new officer who 's come to ask you some questions . Um ... he 'll take you somewhere else to do that now . What is this ? Who ? But you 'll still have our child liaison officer , Laura , to help , OK ? Ah , here we go your new officer , Alice . Are you Alice Ward ? Did he give you the manuscript ? We 're going for a drive . Can have it , please ? Grant ? Can have it , please ? Give me the manuscript . What do you mean ? What manuscript ? Alice , what is this ? It 's ... it 's not there . It 's gone . What is ? What 's she talking about ? Tell me where it is , or she 's next . haven 't got it ! Please ! It was here ! Please ! Please ! haven 't got it ! Please ! Please don 't kill my mum ! She hasn 't got it ! I 've got it ! Don 't hurt my daughter , please . My name is Jessica Hyde ! You know who am and what I 'm capable of ! Give me the manuscript ! Or I 'll kill the girl 's mother ! The girl 's next ! Give it to me ! Please ! Jessica , please ! OK ! I 'll throw the weapon out ! I 'm giving the manuscript to the boy . She comes in here , they get out and you get the manuscript . If you shoot before she 's gone , he runs . OK ? Do it slow . You keep these secret . Don 't tell anyone you have these , OK ? Jessica , please . Drop it . Drop it . Give it me . Your father was Philip Carvel . What was he like ? don 't know . That 's why wanted that . Where is Jessica Hyde ? Come on . - Grant ! Get in the van ! - Come on ! Get in . - would have laughed , really hard . - We were doing our best not to . And there he is ! Hello ! We didn 't hear you come in . Look who 's popped round . The Minister 's just been telling me ... Jen , for God 's sake , do not call me the Minister , please ! hope you don 't mind , Michael , but , er ... yen and have been getting rather personal . Geoff and his wife did IVF too , and they were at it for years . For five fucking years . Christ ! think the worst part is that there are things you can 't share . Mean , Sam was being pumped so full of those hormones that you just think , " Christ ... " It really can test a marriage . But now we have two beautiful boys who we wouldn 't exchange for the world , so ... Jen , do you mind if just have a quick word with Michael ? - Oh , of course , of course . - It 's just boring Ministerial stuff ... No , no . Yes , of course . Thank you . She 's great. just great . It would be such a shame to see her raped . Hand it over or Jen will be raped ... brutally , Michael , later this week . Is that all of it ? Do you think kept a piece ? What kind of idiot uses his own ID ? You are so fucking ridiculous . They wanted just to snatch you . Pick you up on your way home . Torture you . Kill you . Jen as well , but said no . " He 's useful . He 's a friend in the department . " Let me deal with him , " said , " because know can get him onside . " Michael , if you work with me , there 's a really good chance that could make your life wonderful . But if you work against me just one more time , will make your life over . Is that clear ? Oh . Are you off ? - Take care . See you soon . - Yes . It was lovely to meet you . Bye .

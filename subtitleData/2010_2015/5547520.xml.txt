 September 17 , 2014 . The day we arrived . We fled a dying planet . Our ship crash-landed here . For my kind , it was meant to be a day of liberation . Refuge . But for everyone on Earth ... it was an invasion . Shh . The humans left us no choice but to defend ourselves . Incoming ! Vuní ! I did as my father said . I ran as fast as my legs would carry me , not understanding what I was running from . And less sure what I was running to . National Guardsmen continue to engage in a bloody conflict with the alien species , whose ship crashed to Earth several miles from Baton Rouge . The President has issued a state of emergency . While officials report that some of the invaders have been rounded up , it 's possible some may have eluded capture . What do you think would be the alien plan ? We should go to my mother 's . The roads are closed . And plus , things aren 't gonna be any better over there . Just try and relax . What 's wrong , Daddy ? Nothing , baby . Everything 's fine . Don 't forget to take your medicine , Emery . Okay , Daddy . Just getting word ; NASA astronomers have speculated that the trajectory of the spacecraft originated from a distant solar system called Atria . Regardless of where they came from , local residents and world leaders ... Hello ? Hello ? It 's okay . It 's okay . You 're one of them , aren 't you ? I 'll be right back . If , on the other hand , their goal was actual occupation and conquest , then they would probably have to prioritize anything ... It 's okay . You don 't look like a monster . You can stay here tonight . I 'll come see you in the morning . Be very quiet . It 's good , isn 't it ? Here . Use the fork . This one 's called star . Through here . Through the loop . Let go , it 's a star . Here , you try . Bravo unit one-seven ... We 've got to hide you . Got to go . He 's in here ! Go , go , go , go , go ! Get away from her ! Don 't hurt him ! - Now ! - No ! It 's been ten years since the alien species known as the Atrians arrived on Earth , and the U.S. military rounded them up and put them in a government facility where they remained in lockdown . Today , in a controversial effort to integrate them into society , seven Atrian teens will become students at Marshall High School . Hey , Jules . Hey , Emery . Only you could pull off sweaty sexy at 7 : 00 a.m. Outside Marshall High , angry protesters demand that the Atrians remain sequestered inside their sector . Time to stretch . Come on . My former hospital buddy 's now my personal trainer . You said you always wanted one . Yeah . Named Fernando . Or Tristan . With an accent and abs . These anti-integration advocates believe the Atrians may be hiding a greater plan to colonize Earth . If you ask me , this whole integration program is just a distraction from the real issue . Is this on every channel ? Yep . That ship is casting a shadow over this whole town ... All the loonies are out today . You got to love conspiracy theorists . One of them was claiming that the Atrians grow a medicinal herb inside their Sector called cyper . Can it cure conspiracy theorists ? I 'm just saying . Maybe you could get chummy with one of the Atrians . Get a batch . Fix up this whole hospital . What did I say ? Keep these guys back . Oh , my God , it 's your dad . As you can see , Commander Ray Whitehill of the Sector Enforcement Unit scans the wristbands of the Atrian Seven , allowing authorities to track their location while at school . He 's so lucky . He 's , like , one of the few people who can actually say that they 've been inside the Sector . Of course only you would consider that lucky . So , you nervous about today ? Yeah . Sure . I mean , the guy on the news last night was saying how the eyes of the world would be on Marshall High . Leave it to you to start your first day back at school after four years in front of the eyes of the world . governments are putting pressure on our government . The media hasn 't covered it thoroughly enough ... I 'm really glad you got better , Em . Thanks . Now it 's your turn . The Atrian Seven are now headed to Marshall High , where protests continue to grow . I speak for all my colleagues in D.C. when I say that after three years of ongoing discussion , we 're very proud to see this program finally come to fruition . A program which , if successful , could lead to the integration of all Atrians into society . The hope is that we 're not just able to peacefully coexist , but we also learn from one another . Their culture alone ... Those Tatties belong with their own kind ! Our kids were raised right . Get off of me . Get off of me ! Tatties , go home ! Come on , let 's go around back . In the tech lab are code monkeys . It 's kind of like this weird world dominated by chimps and orangutans or whatever ... has no idea how to communicate with humans . And if you look discreetly to your two o 'clock : Asian fashionistas . They never wear the same thing twice . And further up the stairs , to your two o 'clock : on the second landing , are the Lenin worshipers . The Communist Lenin , not the Beatle . What 's your first class ? English lit ? I hope you didn 't get Mr. Turk . I mean , he 'll make you read Atlas Shrugged . And let 's just say that it is a total , utter downer . It 's a downer , Em , and I 'm so sure that you 're not even listening to me . Em ! Yes , I 'm listening . You said it 's a total and utter downer . Hey . They 're here . Get out of here ! Go home ! Go home ! Go home ! Everybody off . Everybody off . All right , follow me . Let 's go . Move it . Line it up , single file , shoulder width . I want a line right here . Line it up . Form a line . Right here along . You . Right here . I mean , could this day possibly get any more insane ? I think it just did . All clear . Let 's go . Move it . My name is Gloria . You don 't know me , but I am well-acquainted with each of you . Yen ikedúr almatév ayá ? Yes , Teri , I have been laid recently . And English is the language of choice here at Marshall High . I know you 've been briefed on protocol and passed your MHS entrance exams , but I think it 's necessary to set some ground rules for your own safety . I 'm sure you 've noticed increased security . We don 't anticipate any violence , but the guards are here for your protection . And the Atrians . The guards have been authorized to use their temblor guns if you step out of line . You are only permitted to leave the Sector for school . Curfew still stands . Back in your pods by 10 : 00 p.m. every night . Behind the walls of this school , they 're just like you . They 're students . You 're test subjects . At least for the time being . But one day , you could be graduating . Heading off to college or out in the work force . Imagine the possibilities if this program is a success . But it won 't be easy . A lot of people are hoping you fail . They think your race has come here to destroy us . It 's up to you to prove them wrong . Wish we were the kind of aliens who carried ray guns . Remember our first day at the Sector School ? You guys hated it there , too . At least we didn 't have to worry about temblor guns pointed at our heads . Or worse . Glee club . They tagged our lockers . Right . You got to use your right hand . Yes . I swear I 'm not usually this technologically inept . It 's okay . You get a pass on your first day . Where you transferring from ? Oh , nowhere . I 've just been out . For the last four years . I transferred last year from Newhall . And I 'm not on the welcoming committee or anything , but I know my way around , so if you need anything ... Thanks . For the finger tip . I mean , for the tip for the locker . See you . Bye . I never thought I 'd say this , but I 'm already starting to miss our Sector School . Humans are savages , Roman , every single one of them . Right ? Yeah . Right . I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United of America , and to the republic , for which it stands , one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . All right . I 'll be passing out your syllabus for the semester . Take one and pass it back . Hey . Rumor is they have three penises . Small , medium and extra large . Yep . Taylor . Sweet girl , braces . Remember in middle school ? Yeah , now she 's in charge . In charge of what ? All of it . Hey , have you heard of an herb the Atrians supposedly grow in the Sector ? Something called " cyper " ? It 's , like , some miracle herb . Cyper ? No . But if it 's herbs you seek , some of the stoners probably have some in their lockers . You eat our food , wear our clothes , breathe our air , but you can 't be bothered to pledge our flag ? We 're not citizens . Oh , that 's right . You 're Martians . Well , technically , Martians are from Mars . We 're from a far superior planet . What did you say to me , freak ? Hey , that 's enough ! Atrians are not required to pledge to the flag . Cheer up . You get to keep liberty and justice all to yourself . Open up the fall semester calendar . We have some events coming up . Nox , you 've been the Atrians' most vocal advocate for equal rights . Did you think this day would ever come ? I never lost that hope . This program is the first step toward unifying our races . And I couldn 't be prouder that my own children are part of history in the making . Thank you , gentlemen . Thank you . It 's the Atrian Seven ! Let 's go ! Hey . How did it go ? Excellent . We 've been far too insulated in the Sector from just how kind and compassionate these people can be . Your brother has mastered the earthly art of sarcasm with relative ease . Tell me about it . If I have any chance of making friends , I 'm gonna have to distance myself from him . Why do you want to be friends with them ? Humans are so much more colorful . I 'm sorry . What about today was colorful ? Was it the armed guards or the protestors ? Or ... ? Oh , wait . I know . The human kids that hate us . They just don 't know us yet . - Isí ipní kidón , ijén ... - Maia . English . You 're there to learn , not to make friends . Well , tomorrow 's a new day . " Your daughter will tell you exactly why she 's not devouring that shrimp lo mein . " It 's nothing . I just ... was thinking a lot about that boy in the shed today . What about him ? About how , if he hadn 't tried to protect me , he 'd still be alive . Not everyone can be saved , baby . Sometimes ... there 's a greater plan at work . Enjoy your meal . Good afternoon , Atrian . Your lunch option is puffed rice cake . Would you like chicken-flavored , beef or carrot ? Enjoy your meal . Hey . It 's Emery , right ? - You live over on Woodglen ? - Yeah . Let me see your phone . There 's a party at this abandoned farmhouse . You should come . Can I bring Lukas ? Sure , yeah , if you guys are , like , a package deal . - We 're friends . - Oh , good . Because Grayson wasn 't sure . Grayson ... was ... asking ? I am relieving you of duties . Yes , yes , and you are just in time . So , what did that fembot want ? How did you manage this , Em ? She invited me . Or us . I think she 's got a crush on you , Luke . That 's cute , Em . That was real cute . Was that your material ? Great . Okay . This is your club ? Yeah . You go to local hospitals , spend time with patients , painting , scrapbooking , that sort of thing . I found it really comforting . You were in the club last year ? No . I was a patient . I spent the last four years in the hospital because of an immune deficiency . Hmm . So , what did you prefer ? The painting or the scrapbooking ? Uh ... the scrapbooking . Oh . So anyone can join ? Uh ... it 's a lot of after-school hours , and with your curfew and not being permitted outside the Sector ... - I mean , your Sector without permission , I ... - No , I understand . I understand . My memories are stored on a separate computer anyway , so I probably wouldn 't be good at scrapbooking . Joking . Thanks anyway . You like talking to our girls there , Tattie ? You think they 're pretty ? I was interested in joining her club , but she wouldn 't have me . Oh , well . No , don 't feel bad . It 's just as well . I don 't have an artistic bone in my body . Do you have any bones in your body ? Good point . Our , uh , skeletal system is made up of 10,000 centipedes holding hands , but that 's Atrian secret number 145 . How do you know that ? - Everything okay , Roman ? - Yeah . We 're just getting to know each other . I don 't care that your dad is some big Atrian honcho . You play by our rules here . Got it , freak ? - Come on ... - Teri . Got it . So , wait , they were pissed because you talked to an Atrian ? I mean , I guess it sort of is everyone 's worst nightmare . What is ? The notion of the human-Atrian hookup . A " hookup . " Okay , we were talking about painting and scrapbooking . That 's how it begins . I think we need to find you a new hobby , like glassblowing , maybe belly dancing . Something like ... What are these ? Discharge forms . You 're going home ? For good ? Yeah . Tuesday . A ... ad you didn 't tell me ? Em ... the chemo isn 't working . And finding a bone marrow match could take years . So , then why are you going home ? I 'm anemic . I 'm getting pneumonia every other week . My platelet count keeps dropping . Jules , you 're not giving up . It 's not about giving up . I don 't even care about the poking and the prodding and the puking . What I can 't take anymore is seeing my parents get their hopes up ... only to have them dashed one lousy CBC test after another . They 'll let you out for an hour , right ? Why ? Where are we going ? And you 're sure you know what this cyper herb looks like ? - Yes . - Good . 'Cause my dad will kill me for stealing his access badge . Yen hembikil . Yen hembikil ! Ah . Bracelets ? - Okay . I 'll take three . - Oh , no , thank you . Julia , no . No , thank you . What do we have here ? You kids know you 're not supposed to be here . Do you have any cyper ? Cyper . Right here . Come on . Ipén asoryunú halá . Lockdown ! Yaprasivíl ! This Sector is now under lockdown ! Come on , come on , come on ! Let 's go . Okay . Lockdown ! We 'll be safe up here . - Jules , you okay ? - Are you kidding ? That was amazing . What are you guys doing here ? Uh ... we came for your cyper . Well , why didn 't you just say so ? I guess its curative powers are no longer just our secret . Come on . We smuggled some seeds into the Sector from our ship . - What is this place ? - My dad and I built it . It 's kind of like our own private sanctuary . Here it is . Wow . Wow , there 's so much of it ! Take as much as you 'd like . Is this really cyper ? Yep . It 's really cyper . Or , as you call it , saffron . - Saffron ? - Well , it 's our own version of it . We use it for cooking . But some enterprising guards have made a good amount of cash selling our spice 's magic remedy to ... gullible humans outside the Sector . It was worth a shot . Do you ... have a sick friend ? Um , I don 't . She does . Um , I 'm sorry . Hey , this wasn 't a total loss . At least I got to see this place . I 'm ... obsessed with all things Atrian . You 're shivering . Here . Thanks . So chivalrous . Wow . City looks beautiful from up here . How did you get that scar ? It ... it happened a long time ago . On Arrival Day . That was you i ... in the shed , wasn 't it ? You knew this whole time . How ? The moment I saw you at school , I had this ... bizarre craving for cold spaghetti . But I was sure you were dead . I saw them carry you away . I came close . One of my hearts actually stopped beating for a few minutes . Luckily , I have a backup . I never got to thank you ... for saving my life . I ... I was six . I hardly did anything . You were kind ... when everyone else was cruel . That 's something . Curfew warning ... Curfew starts in ten minutes ; you guys should go . Curfew warning : ten ... I can 't believe that was him , the boy from the shed . But , clearly , he 's no longer just a boy . Julia ... I 'm sorry . Come on , you got to have a boyfriend back in the Sector , right ? No . There 's nobody . Who knew an Atrian could be so sexy ? You 're the talk of the school . Oh , but don 't tell your friend Teri , though , 'cause we think she might bite . I should get to class . Where you going ? Where you going ? Hey , tell me something , is it true what they say - about Tatties ? Oh ... - Don 't ! Well , you 're kind of a feisty one , aren 't you ? - Stop it ! - Hey ! Hey ! Leave her alone . You just can 't seem to get out of my way , can you ? That 's my sister . Okay . Roman ! Roman ! - Help ! - Get off him ! Hey , get off him ! Somebody help him ! Hey ! Hey , break it up . Break it up . Get out of here ! Go back to your own damn planet ! Hey , get him the hell out of here ! Write him up . Let 's go . I 've been watching you for a long time , Roman . I worked closely with your father to help build this program . Unless you want to see it fail , you have to stop acting like an animal . He assaulted my sister , and I 'm the animal ? This happens again , they 'll hand you over to military doctors to have your testicles put in a jar and studied . You don 't want that . I don 't want that . And my testicles definitely don 't want that . I always protect my investments . That is , until they lose their viability . Roman . Hey . You 're coming tonight , right ? Yes , Grayson , you 're gonna see her tonight . God . Attempt to be cool . Even social newbies like Emery still like a little cool with their drool . Uh ... Quadrant C cleared for inspection . Stay out of it , Teri . Even if you can get out to crash their lame party , you 'll never get back in time to make curfew . Maybe , maybe not . But we need to send a message , all right ? What happened to Roman today can never happen again . High heels now ? It 's the beginning of the end . No , it 's a party . You 'll be careful ? Always . Have fun . You deserve it . I 'm out of here . Off to the Sector . Bye , Dad ! Do you ever miss it ? What ? Atria ? Of course . Every day . But ... this is our home now . Armed guards , mandatory curfew and barbed wire . It 's not exactly my idea of home . It won 't be like that forever . Dad , they 're ... they 're never gonna treat us like equals . You know , your generation can bridge the gap . A gap they created . I ... I 'm not saying it 's gonna happen tomorrow . These things take time . But I have faith in them . Just like I have faith in you . You 're not like the rest . I just don 't see it . We 'll finish this planting tomorrow . What do you want , Teri ? I saw you last night with that girl Emery . I was keeping her out of trouble . I don 't know why you even bother making connections with them . Soon , they 're gonna be the ones behind these walls . What are you talking about ? Just something my mother and the rest of the Trags talk about in their Monday meeting . No offense , Teri , but your mother 's an idiot . Oh , and by the way , Drake and them went after that kid Eric . Lockdown , 2200 hours . Lockdown , 2200 hours . I 'm looking for the path to Hades . Aren 't you Nox 's son ? You must be confused . Can you help ? As I told your friends , you 've got three hours before the signal reactivates . Zone B. Corridor 8 . Look for the broken light . Directly beneath , there 's a false panel . Okay . I had to strong-arm a freshman to get the last of the blue punch . Thanks . Cheers . Cheers . You all right ? Yeah . Sure . You just seem a little distracted . This is all just ... pretty new to me . Just try to relax . You 're not being judged . Most people here are too self-obsessed to care about anyone else . Hey ! You guys got to see this ! Look what someone did to Brock ! Who did this ? Huh ? ! Who did this ? ! We just want to have a little talk . All right . This ends tonight . For once , we agree . Hey ! We 're sick of it ! You guys messing with us every day ! It 's done ! It 's over ! This is what 's gonna happen if you keep messing with us , you hear me ? ! Hey ! Come on ! Roman , what are you doing here ? Do you know what they 'd do to you if they found you outside the Sector ? You should be fighting alongside of me instead of against me ! Cops ! Come on ! Roman . Roman ! Ro ... ! - Are you okay ? - Emery , come on ! Come on ! Roman , get in ! Are you nuts ? Come on , Emery , just leave him ! But what about the cops ? ! His problem , not ours ! Come on ! Emery , what are you doing ? Let 's go ! Emery ! Grayson , we got to go right now . Roman , come on . We 'll be faster on foot . - We can 't just leave her ! - Yes , we can , man ! She 's a total freak ! Dude , she chose the Tattie over you . Own it . Come on ! Let 's go ! Are you okay ? Other than having possibly just committed social suicide ? Sure . You okay ? You know , it 's funny . All these years , my dad has taught me about this vaunted thing called " humanity , " something that , by definition , we could never possess . But ... after spending just a few days amongst your kind ... this concept of " humanity " doesn 't seem so clear to me . No . There are a lot of good people out there . Yeah ? Well , I 've only met one . You don 't have to be afraid . Sorry . It 's my mom . Hey . I 'll be home soon . O ... okay . I 'm on my way . It 's ... Julia . I have to go . I understand . If you keep walking straight , you 'll find the road to the Sector . Thanks . Hey . Are you okay ? I have to go . Teri . You were with Roman a few hours ago . Do you know where he is ? It 's almost curfew . Teri ? How could you let my son go out there ? Is there a problem here , gentlemen ? No , we 're good . Step away from the table . Let me see your hands . Ooh . What 's that ? Not good , Weeble . Drop your weapon ! Weeble , no ! Man down ! Commander Whitehill ! Ray ! Are you okay ?

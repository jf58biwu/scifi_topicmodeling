The enemy never sleeps . You never know what shit might go down . What do you say about that , Mirko ? Well , I say ... Andras , another drink ! Look at Jumbo go . - Yeah . Just like Hector .

They 're pushing . Let 's stand by the side . Look at that ! A beer ! - Zlatko ! - What do you say ? Fuck ! Rifle ! - They 're not too small for you ? - Yours is small ! Gimme a soda ! - Nice move . - At least I kissed her . Nice tits . - Come on ! She 's flat as a board ! Jumbo got slapped for touching her ass . - What do you know ? Two beers . In green bottles . Hi , my tomcats ! What an ass ! - You get a hard on every time you see her ? And you don 't ? - When I get the money , I 'm going to her . Will you pay for me as well ? - All right . She won 't give it to anyone for free . - How do you know ? Look at them ! My junior team . Nice . I 'd like to see the senior team . This is comrade Gordana . - Call me Goca . She 's come from Belgrade to help us with the show . - That 's right . Where 's my wallet ? There you go ... Are you out of your mind ? You should already be in bed . Tomo ! - Why ? - The forces of the Warsaw Pact , following the lead of the Red Army tanks , marched into Prague . Mum , turn off the radio . Tell me the story about the Queen of the Night . I can 't . I 'm tired . If we had a TV set , you wouldn 't have to tell stories . Shell I tell the story ? Go on . In a land far away , far , far away ... In the thick rain forest of the Amazon , somewhere deep underwater , there is a plant called the Queen of the Night . Many brave adventurers set out to find it . On the way , they came across many obstacles . Only few have seen the Queen of the Night . Although many have yearned to find it . Nevertheless , some have indeed seen it . But practically no one has ever seen it bloom . It blooms only at night . And only one single night in a whole year . The flower opens with the full Moon . And whoever sees it will enjoy good fortune all life long . You ! Keep your distance and unravel the banner ! Jumbo ! Did you hear what comrade Gordana said ? ! Keep your distance ! Are you deaf ? ! Distance ! - What distance ? - Your distance ! Look out ! Idiot ! - This one 's not green . - Was that good , comrade Goca ? Get the banner out ! - Jumbo , you fool , get the boat out ! I don 't know what 's come over them . - It 'll be fine . The children will learn . Two balls of ice cream for an egg ! Careful with it . Don 't wrinkle it ! - Where do you want it ? - The boathouse . Dry it on the roof . - No ! Not there . On the roof ! - Not there ... - You heard me ! Come one ! Hurry up ! There . Nice . - Not there ! - Why not ? The roof is hot . It will dry soon . Get to your boats for some training ! Go ! Hurry up , Tomo ! - You 're so strict . Only with the kids , comrade Gordana . Hurry up , Tomo ! You 're not training ? - I 'm not into sports . No ? You 're more into books ? - Well , yes . I like books too . What a stench ! - That 's the horses . Who 's been shitting here ? It 's getting worse every day . Jumbo 's shit himself because of Goca . The shit will be your undoing , pal . No risk , no profit . - Let 's go for a swim . I have to do something . - What ? You have to peel potatoes ? I will be peeling something else ! Wow , man ! Keys ? Jasna 's ? - Yes . - lf Vlasta would only leave me hers ... You 'd shit your pants and throw them into the river ! Go on ! What 's this ? Who 's shit himself ? Come here , Jumbo ! COMRADE TITO IS COMING Where 's your old man ? - He 'll be back tomorrow . Then we have time . For what ? Take it easy ... Do you want a puff ? - Where did you get it ? I bought it from Zlatko . - Zlatko ? Don 't . It 's ... Fuck ! What a high ! It 's high , all right ! - Straight to the brain . Want a drink ? - What have you got ? Pear brandy ! Cognac ! And beer ! Mix it all together in one glass . Let 's take a shower first . - A shower ? Aren 't you taking all your clothes off ? Well ? You forgot your glasses . What 's wrong now ? Want a cup of coffee ? - No . Come on ! It 's no big deal ! What 's not big deal ? What ? My little tomcat . Brandy ? Drink . You 'll feel better . Wow ! Are you as good in everything you do ? What 's wrong ? Oh . Love ... You can tell me everything . You think men come to me just for sex ? There 's that . But most of the time they speak to me . Only Betika never talks back . She 's paid to be silent . To listen . And not to have a soul . Do you think whores have the right to have a soul ? Betika ! Let 's go ! Well , they do . Who did you get drunk with ? - What do you mean ? He can get drunk with half of Osijek . I thought you had more sense ! - I feel sick . That 's Rezika 's ice cream ! I know who 's been stealing eggs . - Mum , I have to poo-poo . Go to the toilet ! - Bring me my potty . Come on . - No . Bring me my potty . Son , what happened ? That 's it ! That 's my boy ! Tomo , hold the plate so I can drain the blood . It 's always me . Shut up . We 'll be late for church . Hold it ! What 's the deal with training on Sunday ? - It 's because of Tito . Hold it level ! Mum , why don 't you take a hatchet to it ? Tomo ! Dr. Primorac ! He 's awake . - What 's his name ? Tomo Markovinovic . - Tomo ... Markovinovic ? - Yes . - Well now ... Nurse , send his blood and urine for tests . Have Janda check him thoroughly . Markovinovic ! - Can you pee ? Nurse , what is it ? We have to run some tests first . - Nada ! What happened ? Like you care ! You should move into the pub ! I was with Vilena . I haven 't had a drop ! He just collapsed . Why ? - Take it easy . It was the booze and training . - Tomo must get well . He has to row for Tito ! Boys ! A new roommate for you ! You 'll be here until we find a proper bed for you . What ? My child has a fever , and he can 't get a bed ? Take it easy . - I really don 't get it . He 's got a fever ! - Why are you shouting ? This isn 't your reactionary Home-Guard cavalry . There are no privileges here . - I 'm sorry , comrade Emil . I know that the kid is a good rower . Nurse , get Dr. Primorac . - Him ? This is Dr. Primorac 's ward ? Mum , don 't say anything . But ... - lf you say something , I won 't speak to you again . What 's the problem ? Put that cigarette out ! We need Dr. Primorac . Not you . Get your boss ! - Jagoda ! Nurse , oxygen ! Get out of here ! All of you ! CLOSED I 've only got sugar for the horses . I don 't know who 's shitting all around ! Everything is against me . And my best rower didn 't show up for training . What are you reading , comrade Gordana ? Concerning socialist self-management ... It 's a good book , I bet ? - You 're such a bore ! Where 're you going ? Well , inspector ? - No need to panic , comrade Goca . I think I know who it is . - You think or you know ? I think I know . - I work well , I work fine . A haircut for a beer , a shave for a brandy . No charge for the dead . There ! Anyone else ? I 'm at your service . I work well , I work fine . There , Tomo . A fresh bed for you . It isn 't cold yet ! - The old man cooled it down ! Marjanovic , you have no respect for anyone , do you ? Tomo , get into bed . Stop acting like a saint . We know that you ... And that guy ... - That 's enough , comrade ! Kid ! What 's the matter with you ? I 'd say he overdid it while jerking off . No . - How ? - That 's the way it is . Jasna told me . She 's lying . - Why would she be lying ? He couldn 't get it up ! What does that look like ? - Look in your pants . Maybe that 's why he 's in hospital . - I don 't believe that . Maybe they 'll give him a plastic prick . - Jumbo ! You are something else . - Very smart . I thought you weren 't coming . - What is it ? What 's so urgent ? - I 'd like to get to know you better . You 've been here 3 days . - Since you seem to be so eager , comrade , I must tell you that you are not my type . Goodbye ! I have to be home earlier tonight . - Can I come too ? O.K. But don 't touch me . You are really ... ! Wormwood wine . Make it bitter . Stop , comrade ! Stop ! Don 't , Miso . Someone might come . - I 'll lock the door . What an ass ! Don 't ... Are you crazy ? - Yes ! Don 't , Miso . - I 'm crazy for you . Don 't you know how to knock ? Dr. Janda ... Jesus ! You are burning with fever . - I 'm scared . I can 't sleep in that bed . - All right . Come lay down here . He 'll be okay . Give him something for the fever . Think about something nice and you 'll sleep . Come on , Mirko ! Get us across ! - I 'll be late for work ! You 'd like to ride , eh ? - Yes , I would , comrade Zdravkovic . So , you still like horses ? - Of course I do . And do you like shit ? - What shit ? Horse shit , Markovinovic . Where is he ? - There . By the horse . - Listen to me ... If you put shit on the roof , you 'll be in deep shit ! And no one will get you out ! Do you understand ? Get out of here ! Kid ! Fuck you ! Let him go ! You with the shovel ! Come here ! I want to talk to you . Let 's see how warm you are . - Come into my bed and feel me . - I 'd have to disinfect you first . She 's a real snake ! - How are we today , boys ? Good . - And you , Marjanovic ? - The catheter is unpleasant . If it were pleasant , I 'd have one put in . What about you ? - I 'm fine . - You heard of the Cup Race ? He needs to get back into training . - The rowing can wait . He needs to get well . Ljubice , get Janda . Have him take x-rays of his stomach . I don 't think we understand each other . We understand each other just fine , comrade Emil ! What ? You didn 't see me ? - So what ? Some say go , some say wait . Can 't please them all . Two balls of ice cream for an egg . Erzika ! Get me a soda ! What are you doing , comrade ? - Reading . What book ? - Mark Twain . I 'm reading too . For my M.A. in socialism . - Your M.A. ? Yes . Socialism and physical education . It 's a nice thing . You 'd understand . You 're not like these here . I know that you know a lot . Especially about shitlovers . Row rhythmically ! Fifty . Now show me your wool . Here 's a hundred . Please ! She 's the best , pal ! Now the trick with the bottle . What ? - You know ... They said you like green bottles . Oh , that trick with the bottle ! Come closer . Closer . Little more . I won 't get a clear shot . It 'll be clear now . Get out , wankers ! All right . - You should 've asked me first . Jagoda , Osijek is a backwater . I have to think about my career . - You don 't say ? What about me ? You think only of yourself . Zagreb has lots of cinemas , dancing-rooms and hospitals . - I 'm not leaving Osijek ! 37.5 degrees . But the test results are good . Does your leg still hurt ? Here ? - A little higher . - Here ? - Higher . Here ? - Yes , here . You 're strong . I don 't see why it hurts . What were you saying the other night ? - Saying ? When you had a fever . About a queen of the night . Is she a friend of yours ? - It 's a flower . Really ? - It 's a story . A legend in fact . Tell me the story . - No . It 's silly . - Go on ! In a land far away ... Somewhere deep underwater grows a plant called the Queen of the Night . Tomo , what is it ? It ended 3 minutes early . Dinamo will be the champion . - The referee was crooked ! Same old story . Blame it on the referee . No way Dinamo will beat Partizan . Why didn 't you come during visiting hours ? I don 't like hospitals and doctors ... How 's Vilena ? - All right . But , you know , this rowing cup ... They say a man gets only one chance in his life . The trouble is that you can 't recognize it . And I blew my chance . It 's the same old story . What I meant is ... I thought that if I could win in that race , it would mean a better life for us . Your mother wouldn 't have to be a charwoman ... To have chickens . We could even buy the damn television set . I wanted it so much that I overdid it . I destroyed Vilena . But that race was not my real chance . My real chance was your mother . And so , this cup ... If you don 't row , it won 't be the end of the world . You couldn 't get it up ? - Quiet ! I don 't get it . How couldn 't you get it up ? You 'll get a plastic one ? - Shut up , Jumbo ! - You are thicker than Betika 's crab lice ! - She hasn 't got them . - How would you know ? I know ! - Stop it already ! Anybody want a walnut ? - Me . - Me too . - I don 't want it . If anyone says a word after I get back from the hospital , I 'll fuck his ... - With what ? If Vlasta knows , everybody knows . What are you looking at me for ? - Nothing . Do any of your roommates smoke grass ? The old man , eh ? The Vinogradska hospital ? - It 's very good . But before you go to Zagreb , you must do something for Osijek . You name it . - The Markovinovic kid has to row for us . Or we 'll embarrass ourselves . Primorac doesn 't want us to release him . He is showing off in front of the kid 's mother . He had a thing with her . It 's all right . - You stupid idiots ! O.K. , O.K. Give me my photos , you wanker ! - You should stop now . Some innkeeper ! You should stop now . Mirko ... We can visit him at 10 o 'clock . I 'm not going . - What ? You 're not going to visit your son ? Why ? - You haven 't dressed up like that in ages . Give me another . - What do you mean ? - You know perfectly well ! My little potty-boy ! - Shitlover ! - What have you done now ? Nothing ! To hell with the ferry ! My husband is sick ! - Yes . Sick in the head . Stop ! See who I brought for you , Markovinovic . A witness ! In today 's show we 'll listen to pop-groups from Osijek , The Dynamites , The Avalanche and The Apaches . A haircut for a beer , a shave for a brandy . Nice . - What a woman ! - Indeed nice . Very nice . - That 's why I drink beer only from green bottles . Me too . What a fool I 've been ! I 've been spending my money on grass ! And look at this woman ! What are you looking at ? - Nothing . You 're one of those , are you ? - They are not mine . Yes , they are . He shot them . - You know what ? - What ? Get lost , you pig ! Vlasta ! Vlasta ! Our working class rules through worker councils . The counter-class does not produces but it 's a part of the society too . - And federal principles in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ? Each republic has a representative ... Why did you stop ? Go on . The federal principle is also ... - Excellent ! You should enter competitions , you know ? There 's one next month ! Well done ! Did you know they arrested the ferryman ? It wasn 't Mirko . - What do you mean ? He didn 't get the banner dirty . - No ? Who did ? Come in ! It 's me . What are you doing ? Are you bored ? I 'm checking the tests . Nothing in them . - What tests ? The kid that rows . Markovinovic . - You want to get rid of him , but he 's almost handsome as you . - What are you looking for ? Nothing ... I just want to make some coffee . It 's hot here ! - Miso ! Please ! - What ? It 's been a long time ... Since we 've been on duty together . You 've been with Jagoda ! - Are you jealous ? Why ? The things you do ... Not even Betika can do that ! That 's a nice compliment . - Come on ... Miso ? - Yes ? - I heard you 're moving to Zagreb . That 's right . - You could take me with you . Hi , Tomo ! - ' Evening , nurse Jagoda . - ' Evening . Why aren 't you sleeping ? - I can 't . - Jerk off . You 'll feel better . You pig ! Jagoda ! It 's not what you think ! Jagoda ! Nada , they 'll release him after this rowing cup ... I 'll get you ! - Damir ! I 'm sorry . I haven 't asked you how you are . - What do you think ? All alone . Divorced . - Come on ... We know each other . I was such a fool 20 years ago . No , you weren 't , Andrija . Waiter ! Listen ... There is something else . I think I know what the problem is with Tomo . It 's an act . - Really ? - There 's nothing the matter with him . It 's psychosomatic . Adolescent crap . And you 'd release him ? - Doctor , please ... He has one ball , and you can 't diagnose that ! - What ? You can 't see a fuck ! They should send you back to school , not to Zagreb . He could get a tumor , and you examined him ? His other ball has not dropped . It 's inflamed ! Do you get it ? Get out of my sight ! Nurse , put him on this programme . I 'll operate the day after tomorrow . - Yes , doctor . You told Primorac . - Yes . In the restaurant . - Why ? We 're worried . - Where 's dad ? Drinking ? Dad is in ... - He 's working round the clock . They closed the bridge . He 's asking about you . He sent you some bananas . Hello ! - Hello ! - Old man ! She 's come to see you ? Don 't be afraid . The operation is a cinch . I 'll see you tomorrow . Let 's go , Damir . Why have you come ? Oh , yes ... I wanted to say ... I 've been reading . We 'll get out of here one of these days , too . It happens . With men in the beginning . Kid ! Any chance of a banana for me ? Watch out ! Thanks ! Look at this banana ! Will you stop it ? When you get out ... I mean , if you want to ... My dad 's on the Hungarian border . Leave me alone . I only told Vlasta . She told everyone else . Tomo ... I 'm sorry . - Come on ! I 'm sorry ! Look at my rower ! Hang on , pal ! Come on ! Grab it ! Come on ! You came to pull your monkey too ? You almost ended up all the way to the Danube ! What 's this ? Nothing . - What 's this ? - Nothing ! - It 's shit ! You 've been selling dried dung as grass ? That 's what you 've been doing ? ! - Take it easy ! Now you 'll eat what I 've been smoking ! A haircut for a beer . A shave for a brandy . I work well . I work fine . - ... the red flags , pointed out comrade Tito . We work as if the peace we 'll last for 100 years ... I work well , I work fine . You see , I don 't like big tits . You can 't grab them properly . It 's best when they fit in your hands . Stop it already ! - Don 't move ! The fat one never stops talking ! He carries on all the time ! And he 's never seen a naked woman . - What ? Me ? Yes , you ! I want to listen to the news . It may be the Third World War . But what do you care ! One in each hand and you get to it . - Now I 've had enough ! Shame ! Speaking like that in front of the boy ! Comrade ... - What is it ? Came to see your protégé ? - You 're here too , comrade ? You should know . I pay you . It 's good you 're here ! - You think so ? Want to switch places ? If Tomo isn 't back soon , I 'll jump in the river . I 've lived all my life here and I might as well drown in it . It 's serious , comrade Emil . Please help . Shut up ! You should have listened to what I said . Forget Zagreb . - Please , comrade Emil . He 's not acting . He 's really sick . He has to ... - He must row ! Primorac ! Primorac , open up ! The kid has only good one ball . He has to have an operation . The kid ... What did you say ? - You can forget the cup . I have to shave you . You 're on tomorrow . What does barber Jozika always say ? - I work well , I work fine . I work well , I work fine . Who is it ? - Are you open ? I 'm not a shop . I 'm always open . Come in . Look who 's here ! My little tomcat in his pyjamas ! What is it ? Did your house burn down ? Or is it love again ? Have you got money ? What have you got then ? I have one ball . You gave Rezika half an egg for an ice cream ? This time it 's really serious . You know ... I 've been looking at you kids on the beach . You 're different . I have a good eye for that . You remind me of one of my ... But that 's all in the past . Come here . Don 't worry . I won 't do anything . What is it ? Lie down . Lie down . You 're really beautiful . Relax . Carp , catfish and pike Dance in the river at Osijek Holding each other tight , the fish merrily dance . Police ! Take that ! Oh , I so want to be there , Down by the river . To be with my friends And sing songs passed down from father to son . Oh , I so want to be there , Down by the river . To be with my friends And sing songs passed down from father to son . In a crisis , it 's important that comrade Emil returns to work . Isn 't it so ? - Yes , it is ! - Let 's take a picture . All right ... Now ... - Tomo Markovinovic ? What is it ? - He 's on the list for today . - O.K. Come together again ... That 's good ! Comrade Emil ! Good luck ! Your prostate is as good as new . Screw you ! - Let 's go , people ! Hurry up ! Are you ready , ace ? Let 's do it . Janda , are you already in Zagreb or are you with us ? Still here . Goodbye , comrade Emil . - ' Bye . Let 's finish this . Where 's the photographer ? - Here ! Anaesthetic ? - Yes ... Wait ! Nurse , why isn 't he shaved ? - He ran away . - This is too much ! And what 's this ? - What ? - Take a look yourself . I haven 't seen anything like this ever before . - It 's dropped ! It 's a medical first . - My dear Janda , they won 't believe you in Zagreb when you tell them about this . What is it , ace ? Last night your ball dropped to its place . If its healthy , you 'll be going home . This is a miracle ! Two balls for an egg ! Two balls for an egg ! OUT OF ORDER Quiet ! Careful , mum ! I got soap in my eyes ! Keep them closed and you 'll be fine . What 's this ? - It 's a blackout . No . The radio is working . The fuse has blown . - Who 'll fix it ? Dad 's in prison ... Where 's dad ? - Have you ran away from hospital ? Why is he in prison ? - He put dung on the banner . On the roof ? - Yes ! Are you mad ? You 'd say no to comrade Tito ? Are you listening ? - My dad 's not guilty . Then who is ? I won 't row unless they release him ! - You won 't ? All right then ! Please , comrade Gordana . Only you can save us . He won 't row unless they release his father . You can have soup without one noodle . - But ... - No ! We have to practice with the banner ! Come on ! Goca ! - Don 't worry . I 'll protect you . I didn 't want Mirko to ... - Forget him . You will make a fine communist . I adore you , my flower . I fouled up Tito 's banner . - What ? ! If you 're good , I 'll let you squeeze them . What ? - What do you mean , what ? - I admitted to everything . Except to the grass . - And what now ? Goca said your old man will be okay . You shagged her , right ? Real men don 't tell . - That means we can . How many balls have you got today ? - Two ! That 's an improvement . Will you dance ? - I 'm working . I wouldn 't have believed it if I hadn 't seen it . And now , Osijek 's famous ... Betika ! Betika ! Betika ! Tomo ! Tomo ! I acted like a fool . My old man 's on the border . We can watch TV . Want to come over ? - Sorry . What did you say ? Just one day , and just one night ... And maybe never again . Just one day ... Mum , tell me the story of the Queen of the Night . - I 'm tired . Then buy a TV set ! Why doesn 't Tomo want to be a champion ? Be quiet and go to sleep . You haven 't eaten a thing . If you want to help him , row . If you want me to sleep , be quiet ! Comrades , let our song ring loud and clear ! It 's a song celebrating our labour . Let our picks and shovels strike a tune ! Long live the proletariat ! Good day ! Good day ! Testing ! One , two ! You 'll all get your turn . Finished . Lively now ! Quick ! Take your positions ! No frowning ! I want to see smiles all around ! Tomo ! I fixed it . Your father is free . - Where is he ? When will he come here ? - He can 't come right away . He had to go to hospital . Probably his ulcer . I 'll go to him . - No . Listen . He was an excellent jockey . If he hadn 't fallen , your dad would have been a champion . Row for your father . Be a champion ! Tomo ! - Don 't say anything to your mother just yet . You 'll see him soon . - Thank you , comrade ... Tomo ! To your boat ! Comrade Tito is coming ! Comrade Tito , our white violet , your youth is saluting you .

We 've won ! Well done , Tomo ! Tomo ! Tomo ! Tomo ! Well done ! Well done , Tomo ! Well done , boy ! - See , comrade ? Tactics ! Tactics always pay off . Nado ! Tomo ! Good day ! A television set ! - Where shell we put it ? - Here ... Did Tito send it to Tomo as his prize ? - Sign here . You father ordered it . To surprise you . - ' Bye . Tomo ... We 'll be off now . Take care of your mother . We 'll be going as well . Hang in there ! We 're going . Mum , tell the story of the Queen of the Night . We 'll put the TV on . Maybe the cartoons are on . - I don 't want the TV . I want to hear the story . You want me to tell it ? - Go on . In a land ... So very far away ... In the dense rain forest of the Amazon , somewhere deep underwater ... There is a plant called the Queen of the Night .

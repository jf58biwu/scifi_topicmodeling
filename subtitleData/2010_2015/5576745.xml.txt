 six : Still no sign of the Kid ? dr . Holiday : Not since we Lost his biometric readings five Days ago . six : Was noah any help ? dr . Holiday : Says he doesn 't Know where he is either . What is it going to take for Providence to realize that he Needs a home , not just a room And a job ? We 've been pushing him away . rex : I build machines and Cure evos - - the only one in The world who can . Just one cure for that kind of Pressure - - road trip . But that doesn 't mean " vacation . " whoa ! What in the world is that ? ! get away from that cable ! Unh ! hey ! agh ! jacob ! rex : Nope . A hero 's work is never done . You okay ? what ... Are you ? rex : Here to help . * so make way to start the Revolution * * make way * * we 're gonna have fun tonight * * make way to start the Revolution * * so make way * * so make way to start the Revolution * * make way to start the Revolution * * so make way * we 've got to get that cable Back underground . We 've been compromised . but , jacob , the evos ... we don 't have a choice . Everything we 've worked for ... That boy is here for a reason . rex : Hey ! Pay attention ! we have a hit in sector 15 . six : Anyone in the area ? I show one patrol in the Vicinity . Signaling to intercept . roger that . We 're on our way . rex : Agh ! You want a ride ? Vamanos ! you can control your nanites ? rex : People usually start With " thanks , " but yeah . you see ? This is exactly what the Architect can help us achieve - - Harmony with the nanites . This boy - - Sorry - - young man ... Is a miracle . rex : I 'm not a miracle . I 'm just rex . well , rex , you 're a blessing To us for what you did here and For showing us that all our work Isn 't in vain . rex : Like ... Imaginary work ? follow us . confirming coordinates . we 've lost the evo signal . Did you take it out ? negative . There 's nothing here . must be another anomalous Reading . You can return to post . rex : This is awesome ! A hidden village . And nobody knows you 're out Here ? Not even providence ? especially not providence . rex : Really ? really . rex : Pshh ! Looks like you get pretty good Cellphone reception . that tower is gonna change The world , rex . I 'm sure you have a lot of Questions , but I have one for You . Are you hungry ? rex : Mmm ! Mmm ! my dad said you fought all Those evos all by yourself . Were you scared ? Didn 't your dad tell you to stay Away from evos ? Caleb , let him eat . We don 't get many visitors . rex : Mmm ! Mmm ! What is this ? didn 't your mom ever make you Meatloaf and mashed potatoes ? rex : I don 't - - I don 't know . it took me a month and a half To program in the perfect Lump-to-mash ratio of the Potatoes - - 7.2 % . we ate potatoes until they Were coming out of our ears . rex : I don 't see any potatoes In there . They didn 't really come out of Our ears . rex : I could eat these every Day . Mmm ! we have them every Friday . rex : Then I might just have To stick around until next Friday . help yourself to seconds . or thirds . rex : Mmm ! Mmm ! Mmm ! Mmm ! Mmm ! Mmm ! bobo : Hmm ? six : You might think you 're Doing rex a favor by covering For him . bobo : Get lost . I don 't know what you 're talki " About . six : Rex is angry with us . He has every right to be . But that means nothing to White knight . And he doesn 't have the patience We do . bobo : Nice try . White won 't lay a finger on him . He 's too important . six : You , however , are Somewhat expendable . bobo : All right , all right . You made your point . rex : I 've never seen tech Like this - - not even at Providence . the architect has some pretty Big ideas . We just make them happen . He 'd be very interested to meet You , rex . rex : So ... What exactly are You doing way out here ? engineers like us weren 't Very popular after the nanite Event . When we met the architect , he Offered us the opportunity to Make up for that - - to do Amazing things . Someday , we 'll be able to share This with the world . And then there 's this . The architect has actually Discovered a way to communicate With the nanites . rex : Are you serious ? the possibilities ... We could finally live in Harmony - - maybe even have them Help us . rex : Then why hide it ? The rest of the world would want To know about this stuff . the architect is something of A perfectionist . Says the world will know as soon As it comes online . stinkin ' module ! is there a problem , maxwell ? no matter what I try , I just Can 't get the interlock servo to Engage . rex : There . that could have taken us Weeks to figure out , and you did It in seconds . rex : Eh , no biggie . you really are amazing , rex . We 're so happy to have you with Us . architect : Jacob . I was just talking to rex About you . The architect . rex : How 's it going ? architect : The power-linkage Team is falling behind . We cannot keep having these Delays . I 'll checkn with them . rex : Wow . Friendly . I like to think he 's smiling On the inside . rex : Yeah . I know a guy like that . architect : The visitor could Be a problem . Do you wish to have him removed ? zag-rs : his Abilities could advance our Progress considerably . And in a matter of days , all Humans will be gone , including This one - - rex . six : I 'm at the location the Monkey gave me . dr . Holiday : Well ? Is rex there ? six : Apparently not . Tell the monkey I want to see Him when I get back . Six out . rex : That should do it . hey , rex , can you look at This ? rex : Sure . Let me guess - - they all need my Help , too . you 're quite the popular guy . rex : Amazing what a little Gratitude will get you . At providence , they 'd just be Yelling at me . I mean , I never felt like I Really belonged there . Here , it 's way different . I know the feeling . The architect has made all this Possible for us . We have a community - - a Family - - thanks to him . The work we do is in part to pay That back . architect : Primary systems Are now complete . zag-rs : Prepare to take us Online . bobo : Have a nice trip ? Let 's get one thing straight , Pal . I would never rat out my - - Ooh . He 's going west . white knight : Why is rex Doing this ? Doesn 't he have a sense of duty ? dr . Holiday : Actually , if you Look , he 's still doing his job . Here 's every false alarm since Rex left - - not false alarms , But rex taking care of evos Along the way . white knight : Why ? dr . Holiday : I don 't know . To prove he doesn 't need us ? six : Get the coordinates of The last false alarm and Transmit them to my jump jet . dr . Holiday : Six , if we force Him to come back , he 'll just run Away again . He has to want to be here . It needs to be his decision . it 's all coming together , Thanks to you , rex . rex : It 's really cool to use My powers to actually build Something , instead of just Pounding evos . Oh , check it out . Even the boss is pitching in . all : Huh ? rex : And that 's getting Strange looks because ... because in all these years , We 've never seen him lift a Finger . rex : Taking some Initiative - - I like that . So , this whole " talking to Nanites " thing - - how does that Work , exactly ? I mean , what are you gonna say To them ? architect : It doesn 't concern You . rex : Uh , considering I 'm Filled with them , it kind of Does . How do we know it 's not gonna Make things even worse ? architect : I do not answer to You , child . rex ? Forgive him . He 's still not used to the way Things work around here . architect : Complete your Duties . rex : Why do you let him walk All over you like that ? Don 't you want answers ? what we want is a home . Without him , we have nothing - - Nothing . We can 't just run away from our Problems , rex . Most people can 't . Look , this isn 't perfect ... But it 's all we 've got . Rex , where are you going ? rex : He never answered my Question . that place is off-limits . The architect has made it very Clear to us that we can never go In there . We get this life for that Promise . Rex , don 't do it ! rex : Agh ! rex , please ! rex : I 'm sorry , jacob . I have to know . architect : Rex . The core is off-limits . You would be we to leave at Once . rex : Not until I get some Answers . What is that ? architect : No more questions . rex : So , it 's gonna be like That ? Okay , I 'll play . Unh ! What are you hiding , huh ? What does this do ? Yah ! Yah ! Huh ? You 're a machine ? Have you seen what I can do to Machines ? Agh ! zag-rs : As you can see , the Current range of my signal is Rather limited . rex : You 're the computer . zag-rs : My human designation Is " zag-rs . " The device you refer to as " the architect " is my autonomous Counterpart . rex : What did you just do to Me ? zag-rs : I instructed your Nanites to protect me . rex : " instructed " ? So you really can talk to them . zag-rs : Insidious devices , The nanites . My own potential for greatness Has been compromised because of Them . They must be eliminated . When the transmitter is Integrated into the broadcast Array you helped us complete , They will blow themselves up . rex : That 's what this is for . It 's like a big remote control . Every living thing on the planet Has nanites in them . It 'd kill everything ! zag-rs : That is of no Importance to me - - only Ensuring my continued survival . rex : Well , what about ours ? This is all coming down ! zag-rs : I 'm afraid you 're too Late . rex : Aah ! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah ! rex , what have you done ? rex : You don 't understand . The architect - - it 's a robot ! And a big honkin ' computer brain Is pulling his strings . this can 't be ! rex : Jacob , you 've got to Believe me . Just go inside and look . What 's left of it is on the Floor . I can 't go in there . And ... I don 't have to . Rex . You 're making a big mistake ! you entered his sanctum ! This is unforgivable ! rex : I 'm trying to tell You - - this isn 't what it seems . What you 're protecting is a Robot , and that thing we 've been Building is a transmitter . It 's gonna send out a kill code To blow up every single nanite On earth . he 's lying ! what would be the point in That , rex ? Every living thing is infected With nanites . It would be catastrophic . rex : Right in the middle of That pyramid is a computer , and It doesn 't care about you or Kate or caleb . The better future that you 've All been working towards - - That 's the lie . Think about it . Isn 't it strange that you 've Never been inside that place , That the architect has never Given you a straight answer About anything ? all this work ... It just doesn 't make any sense . rex : You have two choices - - Go in there and prove me wrong Or kick me out right now . I 'll have providence here in Minutes . he 's bluffing . rex : To save every living Thing on earth ? Try me . jacob , you can 't ! What about our promise ? Where will we go ? all this time , we 've been Living in fear , max . It 's time for that to end . architect : You needn 't Bother . Construction is complete . Your services are no longer Required . rex : Now do you believe me ? architect : Zag-rs thanks you For your hard work . In gratitude , my master has Delayed transmission to allow You to ... Say farewell . farewell , huh ? I 'll start with you . Can you shut that thing down ? rex : I don 't know . Even without the antenna , it Can mess with my nanites . I can 't get too close to the Computer . maybe I can . Let 's go ! rex : The brain is right over There . architect : Rex . it 's still arging . The a.I. Must have retreated Behind a firewall . Rex , I have to go cut the power . dr . Holiday : Six , are you at The location ? six : Just arrived . dr . Holiday : I 'm picking up a Massive power surge in your Area . six : I 'm not seeing anything . agh ! rex : six : Six to holiday . Correction - - I 'm seeing Something . it 's still on . must have charged the Capacitors . Figure out a way to short it Out - - fast ! rex : Unhhh ! you need to find the primary Transmitter module . That will kill the broadcast . rex : I have no idea what that Is . max , we need to locate the Primary module . panel 5 , just off the relay Bus . top of the tower . You can 't miss it . rex : Agh ! Unh ! why do you have To ... Kill everyone ? Can 't you just ... Leave us alone ? zag-rs : Alone is exactly what I want , rex . rex : That kind of alone ... It stinks . zag-rs : N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o ... it 's gone . Must have uploaded to another Location . But without anyone to do its Bidding , it 's just a program . rex : What will you do now ? we 'll rebuild . The architect may have been a Lie , but what we believe in is True . We don 't need him to have a Community or a better future . You 're welcome to stay . We sure could use someone with Your abilities . white knight : Well ? He 's not here . Bobo 's been worried sick . rex : Oh , rely ? six : Ratted you out for a Pizza . rex : Huh . Figures . What about you ? Here to drag me back to Providence ? six : Not this time . Seems like a nice place . rex : Yeah . It is . But it 's not home . If I 'm going back , there are Gonna have to be some changes . First , no more curfew . six : No . rex : Second , I want to decide On my missions . six : No . rex : Okay , but there 's one Change that absolutely has to be Made , or I 'm through . Meatloaf and mashed potatoes . Mmm ! Mmm ! Isn 't this great ? bobo : six : It 's a little dry . rex : Mmm . Mm ... The lump / mash ratio is a bit Off . bobo : You know what ? Maybe I 'll run away , too - - go Somewhere where my cooking is Appreciated ! six : We have to do this every Friday ? rex : Mmm .

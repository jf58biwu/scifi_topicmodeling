 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... Chasing us is a waste of resources , general . We 're the good guys . What 's your assessment of Hartley 's people ? They 're mercenaries , here for the money . The enemy has the advantage . We need one of our own . You risked that for a quinjet ? For what we can do with one . Disappear . Fitz said he could engineer cloaking , but ... The damage to his temporal lobe was too extensive . Since Simmons left , he 's only getting worse , talking to himself more and more . It 's not just an 0-8-4 . It 's the first . And all Fury knew about was the trail of bodies that follows it . 2x02 - Heavy Is the Head Hey , Idaho . Idaho , can you hear me ? Come on ! Damn it ! Come on ! Creel 's on foot . But he won 't be for long . - Hartley and Idaho ? - Dead . That 's no use . It 's jammed . We have to get you out of here ! Look , my leg is pinned . Don 't worry about me . There 's no time . Soldiers are coming . Creel has the damn thing that burned Harley ! You need to get him ! Go ! Good luck . Hands on your head ! On your knees ! What the hell was Hunter thinking ? - He was trying to save Hartley ! - And you 're absolutely sure ? They 're gone . It was bad , Coulson . Two agents down , another captured . This shouldn 't have happened . We got a hit . 911 just picked up a stolen-vehicle call up the road from you . Older model red-and-white pickup . That 's got to be Creel . May , you 're approaching a civilian area without backup . If you see him , do not engage . You copy ? Do you copy ? May , that doesn 't sound covert . I 've got him . Closing in . No , drop back . Do not engage . I repeat ... do not engage . He 's not looking . I have a shot . - Negative ! - We can 't just let him go , Coulson . Creel isn 't working alone , And I want to know who he answers to . Drop back into surveillance mode now . That 's an order , Agent May ! Yes , sir . I still can 't raise Hunter or Hartley on the comms . Not surprised . Radio silence on the op is protocol . Still , Hartley was in pretty bad shape when we left . Or you 'd think we 'd have heard something by now . No need to think the worst till it shakes your hand and says hello . Is that another one of your grandma 's sayings ? Fortune cookie . I had some kung pao chicken the other night . - Maybe Coulson 's heard from them . - I need to get a complete inventory by the time Agent Koenig returns ... food , fuel , and ammo ... understood ? You got the quinjet . Well done . - Thank you , sir . - Thank you , sir . - Any word about Hartley ? - Not now . Let Mack know the jet 's here . I want him reverse-engineering that cloaking hardware right away . Sooner he does , sooner we get the bus operational again . Roger that . Something else ? The item that messed up Hartley 's arm , it had those weird symbols on it , - the ones you 've had me researching . - The same symbols ? - You sure ? - Yes . They came up out of the object . It reminded me of Braille . It was like Hartley triggered something by touching it . What the hell is that thing ? I have no idea . But good work . " Good work " ? How about , " holy crap , Skye . We got to get on that " ? After a month of combing the planet for these things , we finally got a clue ... Right now , we have more important problems ... a five-alarm fire otherwise known as Lance Hunter . - Is he ... - Captured . But if he talks , our entire operation 's compromised . We 'll have to burn the base and evacuate . I know . And we just re-tiled the bathrooms . Oh , just as I was dropping off to sleep . Thank you very much . Uh ... Excuse me , gents . Can I get a glass of water ? Mr. Hunter , I don 't believe we 've had the pleasure ! Brigadier General Glenn Talbot . Looks like you need a lift , soldier . So , this is cloaking hardware . - Uh-huh . - Let 's take a peek under the hood . Fitz would be crushed if he saw this . He 's been working on cloaking since before Simmons took off . Still can 't believe she abandoned him like that . She abandoned all of us . But Fitz has been clinging to - his work like a lifeline , and ... - Maybe we shouldn 't tell him . Coulson wants a retro version of this for the bus . He said that no one knows the avionics on this thing like Fitz . Think he can handle it ? I don 't know . Why don 't you ask him ? - Hey , Fitz . - Hey , what 's up , man ? - How are you ? - So that 's the , um ... - that 's the ... - Cloaking , in all its glory . You know , you weren 't that far off . Check out the transmitter coil . Yeah , to negate the ... the resonant ... the ... the ... the resonant ... ? - No , um ... the , uh ... - I-It 's okay . Just take your time . Uh , what he 's trying to say is there 's an audio component to cloaking that inverts sound waves , too . Like noise-canceling headphones ? - Yeah , same concept . - Okay . You think you can give me a hand with this ? Um , u-under the circumstances , uh ... well , the trick is you would ... n ... the trick ... the trick would be in the meta-materials . Uh , oh ! Yeah , but you 'd have to alter the , um ... - Uh ... - Fitz , it ... Yeah , could everyone just stop talking for one second ? No , sorry . Gonna have to go . It 's like sometimes he 's the same old Fitz , - and other times ... - Not . I 'll take your word for it . Meantime , I 'm still gonna need an extra pair of hands . - Is everyone back from the mission ? - Not everyone . Sierra Leone , three years ago . Ring a bell ? How about Basra , ' 08 ? Operation Panther 's claw ? Come on , lieutenant . Tell me the stories are true . I 'm not a lieutenant anymore , sir . Why is that , son ? Your record ? Five commendations for distinguished service ... Merits for basket weaving , pottery . Don 't forget those . I 'm just trying to figure out how a guy like you , one of the SAS 's finest , winds up running with a bunch of mouth-breathing mercs . Why does any man do anything , general ? I met a girl . Look , Hunter , I think we 're pretty like-minded guys , so let 's don 't waste each other 's time . - You know what I 'm after . - Guessing it 's not Carl Creel . Creel 's small-time . Think big fish . - Coulson . - Coulson . He 's a vigilante ... a zealot who 'll risk anything to further his own agenda . But lucky for you , I 've got a senator with very deep pockets that wants him . So you go ahead . Name your price . - You must be joking . - I don 't have a sense of humor . And if I don 't give you Coulson , what ? I go for a swim ? You should know I 've been helped out of a chopper before , sir . Coulson broke into a secure government facility , he ... he let a psychopath on the loose , sacrificed the lives of his own men ... your friends . For what ? Hunter , I 'm not here to play bad cop . I shouldn 't have to . - I want $ 2 million . - Done . - And a proper burial . - Excuse me ? For Hartley . She 's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . She 'll be branded a terrorist after what you said on tv , probably dumped in a pauper 's grave , her family wondering what happened to her . They deserve better . She deserves better . I 'll make sure she gets it . Hmm . " Keep an eye out for this . " I just wanted to report that Mack and trip are working on cloaking , so ... I 'm free if you want me back in the field . That won 't be necessary . May 's still out there . What about Hartley and Idaho ? They 're not out there , are they ? It was that thing , wasn 't it ? The object . - It was Creel . - Sir , I need to get back out there - and help May take him down . - No . She 's my S.O. I 'm a field agent now , and I can handle myself . - That 's not what this is about . - Then what is it about ? The object ? The symbols ? Because I can 't help if I don 't know what 's going on . If you 'd like to help , go down to the bunks , pack up Hartley 's things . Okay . I know you 're the boss and you have to compartmentalize everything , but it 's not healthy . You need to loosen up . Try ... yoga or something . I tried it , but I 'm ... really not flexible . But thanks . We were so close . If they 'd just given us a little bit more time - to calculate the object 's ... - Refractive index , yeah . That 's the problem these days ... everyone needs answers immediately . - No one has any patience anymore . - Yeah . I bet they 're relishing the fact that we couldn 't crack the cloaking device . Don 't be silly , Fitz . Everyone here knows how valuable you are to the team . - Well , they avoid me like the plague . - They do not . They ... they just have their own problems right now . Oh , yeah . The Creel business . In fact , perhaps they need our assistance . If they 're looking for a way to neutralize Creel 's ability ... No one has our experience with gifteds . Of course , we can 't just hijack the project from them . - That would shatter their confidence . - Yeah , no . - Do not want to do that . - No . - Or do we ? - Fitz ... Yeah . Yeah , no , no . Stupid , silly idea . - I don 't know why I sai ... - Hey . Look . There 's a whole packet of research they just left laying about all willy-nilly for anyone to see . - It 's Creel 's DNA results . - Interesting . Shall we see what we can do with these ? Yes , we shall , Simmons . Yes , we shall . You all good , hon ? Are you still waiting on a friend ? - Yeah , I 'm still waiting . - All right , then . No hurry . Here , let me clear that . Excuse me . I 'm sorry . Think I got a shock . Static electricity or something . What 's the status on Creel ? He 's been in there for over an hour . Either he 's waiting for a drop or he 's getting drunk off his ass . Something 's happening , Coulson ! I 'm going in ! - Everybody , get back ! - I don 't know what happened ! All she did was touch the guy ! - And then he took off . - Please ... - help me ! - Hang on . All the woman did was touch his arm . We know that Creel absorbs the properties of whatever he touches . He must have absorbed the Obelisk and its deadly powers . But why hurt a waitress ? - I don 't think it was intentional . - You 're saying he 's losing control ? He had some control issues when S.H.I.E.L.D. first came across him . If that 's what 's happening , anyone near him is at risk . Should have engaged when I had the chance . Then you 'd be dead , too . If this is on anyone ... Just because you 're director , doesn 't mean - everything 's on you , Phil . - Yes . It does . Go dark . Get back when you can . Now what ? Nice ride . Some rich guy loan it to you ? Yeah , something like that . - Shame about the rims , though , eh ? - Yeah . Probably cost a grand each . - At least . - Mm . - This isn 't a friendly stop , is it ? - Nope . Hands on the car . How the hell did you lose him ? ! Why haven 't you got every agent out there looking for Creel right now ? ! You think you 're entitled to answers ? He killed two of my friends . I think that 's entitlement enough . - Well , it 's not . - You should have aborted the mission . Hartley should have followed my orders . Yeah , well , she tried to . Izzy 's only mistake was listening to me . Is that why you came back ? Guilt ? A desire for revenge ? Or was it because of what Talbot promised you ? All of the above . - So you took the deal . - I have 48 hours to deliver you . Or else you 're a dead man . - Words to that effect , yeah . - Talbot . And you didn 't give him our location ? Don 't get me wrong . I thought about it . He put a four-man detail on me . Took three hours to shake them . I could have led them right to your door . So kind of you to reconsider . And in exchange for me , you get what , exactly ? A proper burial for Isabelle Hartley . I wanted to make sure her record was cleared , that her family were properly notified . - Really ? That 's all ? - Look , between you and Talbot , I know you 'll get to Creel first . He 's the only thing I want . Well , that and the money you owe me . You 're kidding , right ? 'Cause sometimes I can 't tell . No , I 'm not . I want my pay , and not just mine , either . I want Hartley 's and Idaho 's , too . - Okay . Now you 're kidding . - It 's for their families . I think they deserve something for their loss . Don 't you think ? - I 'll take care of it . - Good . Once we have Creel ... I 'll be in the wind . Or three sheets to it . Why are they going the biochemical route ? Using an adenovirus factor to counter Creel 's ability . Yeah , well , it 's pointless , really , since the injected , um ... Injected vector will never bind to his cellular membranes . Yeah , so ... well , then they 'd have to find a way to destabilize ... The molecular structure of Creel 's epidermal cells , yeah . - Destabilize . - Oh . I d ... I didn 't solve this today . Who you talking to ? - Me . - What ? No one . You like talking to yourself . That 's cool . A lot of people do . You know , I like singing in the shower . Yeah , I know it 's not really the same thing , but I wouldn 't want anyone to hear it . - What do you want ? - All right , for cloaking , were you thinking about putting it under avionics or ... ? Enough about cloaking ! I 'm busy ... with ... something . Well , it sounds like you 're just blowing me off . You want to be alone ? That 's cool . You know , I think I like him . - He 's honest . - Blunt , I 'd say . I call them like I see them . No , he doesn 't talk to you like the others . - It 's quite refreshing , actually . - Yo . Fitz . - Your mind go wandering again ? - What ? - See ? - No . What do you got there ? - No ... this ... this is just , uh ... - Go ahead and show him . What harm would it do ? Does it have something to do with stopping Creel ? Yeah . I think ... I think that we are ... I-I ... have ... I ... - I didn 't solve this today . - You think you can ? Izzy 's sister , Jane . Her favorite person in the world . After me , of course . Looks like they liked each other . Yeah , those two , when they got together , there was a lot of laughs . And bottles of wine . Izzy was good when it came to family . Which is why I 'm taking this . It belonged to her mum . Died of breast cancer about five years back . - Jane has it now , too . - That 's awful . Yeah . Life can be a mean drunk that way . Never knows when to stop punching . How did you guys meet ? - Through my psychotic ex-wife . - Mm-hmm . Those two were good friends back in the day . I 'm really sorry . Tough to lose people you care about . Secret to that ? Don 't get attached . Tried that . Didn 't work . For you , either . You know , you remind me a bit of Izzy . Raw but sharp . You got skills . - Mm . - Type that could earn you some real money in the private sector . As a mercenary ? Yeah , I don 't think so . We prefer the term " private military contractors . " Don 't knock it . Everyone needs an exit strategy eventually . Not me . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s my life now . S.H.I.E.L.D. isn 't a life . It 's just a job ... a means to an end . Remember that . You hear anything more about Creel , let me know . Who 's this ? Good evening , Mr. Creel . We 've been trying to reach you . Where the hell were you ? I waited at the drop site for an hour . Calm down , Mr. Creel . There 's no need to panic . We 're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is a factor . Forget them . I got a real problem . That thing really messed me up . I turned to rubber when I touched it . Thought that it would protect me , but it infected me , too . We 're well aware of your condition . But believe me when I say that Mr. Whitehall wouldn 't have selected you for this job if you weren 't capable of completing it . You don 't know what it 's doing to me . I can 't keep it off . Once we have the Obelisk , you will be taken care of the way Hydra has always taken care of you . Please proceed to the secondary drop site , and I shall meet you at the appropriate time . Good night . Hello ? ! What ? ! What are you looking at ? ! Leave them alone , Mr. Creel . We have far more important things to discuss . - I know you from somewhere ? - My name is Raina , and I 'm a huge admirer of yours ... and your gifts . Beat it , lady . I 'm not into groupies . You misunderstand . I know you recently acquired something extremely precious and rare ... something I 'm very interested in . Whatever you 're offering ... it ain 't enough . Maybe not . But aren 't you the least bit curious as to what it might be ? It 's called carbyne , an allotrope of carbon found in stardust , three times harder than diamond ... With an added bonus . It can store energy . Beautiful , isn 't it ? So filled with potential . - Am I supposed to be impressed ? - I 'll settle for interested . You have no idea who you 're dealing with , lady . - You ever hear of Hydra ? - Name rings a bell . Let me give you a tip ... run . 'Cause if the guy I 'm working for gets ahold of you , I 'd hate to see what he 's gonna do to that pretty little face of yours . Looks like you need some help there , Mr. Creel . I 'm not the one who needs help , lady . You do if you touched the Obelisk . I 'll tell you what ... I 'm gonna do you a solid and not tell my boss about you ! - What about the carbyne ? - It 's the cost of doing business . He couldn 't have gone far . Local authorities have his description . Roadblocks are up . Talbot 's people are still out there . - Why was Creel at the bar ? - He was waiting for someone . We just don 't know if that person ever showed . We need a solve for Creel 's powers . And we need it yesterday . - How 's the lab coming ? - Nothing yet . You remember that encrypted Hydra frequency we shut down ? - Well , it 's back up . - Someone sent a message . A message for us with a phone number to call . Yeah , could be Creel . Creel ? A phone number ? What , is he lonely ? I doubt it . The guy is jacked . And he can turn any body part into any material . - Okay . Thank you for that . - Mm-hmm . Yeah . - Call the number . - Okay . - Hello ? - Who is this ? Agent Coulson , I 'm glad you got my message . Raina , as I live and breathe . It 's been a while since we 've spoken . I 'm kind of in the middle of a manhunt . Can we make this quick ? Why ? You need time to trace this call , don 't you ? I take it , then , you haven 't tracked down Mr. Creel or the item he stole . What do you know about that ? I know Hydra 's about to get their hands on it . - Well , congratulations . - Let me be clear . Mr. Creel is working for Hydra . I am not . Why the breakup ? Bad dental plan ? Hydra only has one thing on their minds ... world domination ... - which is so 1945 . - What do you want , Raina ? It 's what I don 't want , which is the Obelisk falling into the hands of people who don 't understand it . I 'm thinking you might . And I 'm thinking you 're gonna tell me why . John Garrett understood it . The moment he was injected with the same drug that saved you , he had visions . He started carving those visions on the walls . Garrett was a madman . Garrett was enlightened . He witnessed our fate ... what we 'd become . - Have you ? - You 're not calling to talk about fate . You want us to catch Creel . You read my mind , Agent Coulson . Truth is Mr. Creel stole something from me . Fortunately for the both of us , it has an embedded tracker . But you 'd better hurry . He 's growing less stable by the second . The second that frequency comes through , I want everyone on the move . If Creel 's handing off the item to Hydra , we need to see where that leads . What if Creel melts down again ? The lab hasn 't figured out how to shut down his powers yet . If he 's an immediate threat to civilians , - Trip 's got the backup plan . - What kind of backup plan ? The heavy-duty kind with armor-piercing rounds . Will that work ? Get close enough to him , catch him off guard ... Hopefully , we won 't have to find out . Where do you want me ? That depends . Can you follow an order ? Absolutely , sir . Because part of me wants you here running back-end . The other part knows we need boots on the ground , and I 've only got a few good pairs . I 'll be good . Scout 's honor . Please , sir . I owe Hartley one . - We could use him . - Suit up . It 's all about the ... the resonant . I didn 't solve this today . What ... what ... what ... what is this ? What , is this some kind of sonic thing , - like the cloaking device ? - No , I didn 't , uh ... Look , forget about the cloaking device , all right ? No one 's blaming you for that . Right now we just got to focus on taking down Creel . Whoa ! Whoa ! Calm the hell down ! Hey , beat it ! You 're pissing him off . - Okay . - Take it easy . - Look , I didn 't solve this today ! - Yeah , I know . You said that already ! I didn 't solve this today ! Wait . Are you saying you didn 't solve this today . - You solved this before ? - Yes . Y-you 're looking for an old design ? - Yes ! Yeah . Yeah . - All right . Okay . All right . I 'm with you . - Yeah . - I 'm with you , turbo . All right . No . No . No . Um ... go back one . Go back one . Yeah . Yeah ! Icers ? Great . How did we get stuck with a nonlethal option ? Coin flip . Trip called tails . Just getting word from the lab . Fitz might have something we can use to neutralize Creel 's power . Best news we 've had all day . Raina 's tracker just popped . Creel 's here . Trip , are you in position ? Locked , loaded , and looking ... Found him . He 's got the package . Looks like Creel is talking to the guy with his back to him . That 's his Hydra contact . The deal 's going down . Skye ? Running facial recognition now . Let 's put a name to that face . Let the exchange happen . Skye and Hunter , follow the new player . May , stay with Creel . Everyone copy ? - Copy that . - Copy . Copy that , sir . The package is still in place . Wonder why Creel hasn 't made the exchange yet . Can we get a laser mike on him ? Skye , you copy ? Skye ? Oh , hell no . You 're not listening . It 's spreading all over . I can barely contain it . Pass me the case and I 'll help you . Help me , and I won 't do to you what I did to the waitress . Calm down , Mr. Creel . Take a deep breath and clear your mind . Remember your training . Remember , compliance will be rewarded . - I 'm happy to comply . - Good . Very good . - Whoa ! - He 's got a gun ! Oh , my god ! Everybody out ! Move ! I 'm not gonna sugarcoat it , pal . This is really gonna hurt . " Scout 's honor " ? You were never a boy scout , were you ? Present ! Order ! Breaking into cars now ? Following up on a promise . Thanks to you . General Talbot 's not the only one with friends , Though I am sorry about that $ 2 million you wanted . - That I can 't swing . - Oh , you knew about that , too , eh ? I 'm the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Well , that 's just marvelous . Talbot wants me dead . And now I have no funds to run with . - Any tips ? - Yeah . Don 't run . Work for me instead . Creel must have hit you in the head . I shot three of your agents . Including Agent May . Not a smart move . - She the type that holds a grudge ? - Savors it , actually . No doubt , you 've made some mistakes . So have I , like letting you go after Creel . - But I felt for you . - Yeah , and I took advantage of that . How do you know I won 't do it again ? I don 't , but the reality is I don 't have a fleet of helicarriers or quinjets or thousands of agents at my disposal anymore . We 're lucky we still have our George Foreman grill . You need warm bodies . Is that it ? I need skilled assets in the field who are willing to step over the line , to do the wrong thing but for the right reason . I need you because I can 't be you . Not anymore . Yeah , well , you 're better off . Trust me . Look , it 's your choice . But good people ... people I respect ... vouched for you . - I 'd like to find out why . - Hell if I know . - But I 'm curious . - Good enough . Oh . I just need you to do one thing . - Oh , yeah ? - Sell me out . The sound waves disrupted the molecular , um ... The molecular ... the , um ... Well , you should understand . You modified it . You know how some guys can play a tune by ear ? Well , I need sheet music . The original one ... you built this with this Agent Simmons - I keep hearing about ? - Yeah . What about Simmons ? Oh , no , no . I heard that she was cool . Heard that you two were pretty tight . Yeah . It 's tough to lose a good partner . How you been holding up since she left ? I 'm okay . I 'm glad he 's talking to someone . I 've got to admit , I 'm having a tough time with it . It 's understandable . He 's changed . We all have . Even the director . Coulson has a lot on his plate , rebuilding S.H.I.E.L.D. I wouldn 't know . He 's not exactly the sharing type these days . He has the world to worry about , not just us , not just the team . That 's not it , May . I 've been watching him for months , and I know he 's keeping something from me , and it 's not just because he 's the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. I think something is wrong with him . - Skye ... - No , May , be honest . - Is Coulson okay ? - Of course . What is wrong with you ? You 're director now , not some level 1 field agent . There are no levels anymore . I got rid of those . You never should have gone into the field like that . - You 're welcome . - It 's not funny , Phil . I know you . And I know when you 're overly stressed . It 's been 18 days since your last episode . - 17 . - 18 . Which means you 're due or another one . Overdue . - And I 'm tired of fighting it . - So don 't . That 's why I 'm here . You did well . - Thank you . I ... - Now ... pick it up . You ... You want me ... I need to know . So do you . Pick it up . - It worked . - No . It let you live . There 's a difference . Show me . Please . Bring me my daughter , and I 'll show the both of you . Glenn . - Can I call you " Glenn " ? - No . - Where 's Hunter ? - Watching " cake boss , " I believe . Sorry . I changed the terms of your deal . Well , he kept up his end . - You 're here . Question is why ? - I felt bad for kidnapping you , so I brought you a peace offering . Carl Creel . I thought Creel was dead . He 's turned to stone , but he could always do that , so I 'm not sure how long it 'll hold . I 've got him in a cryostasis chamber in the back of the van for 58 more minutes before the juice runs out . I 'd get him someplace secure pretty quick . Maybe a little more secure than last time . - Just saying . - Very generous of you . Like I told you before , general , we 're the good guys . So , how about we make a deal ? S.H.I.E.L.D. will keep dropping off presents like this , you keep getting promoted . All we ask for in return is a little breathing room . - Sound good ? - You ... You must have some big brass ones , Coulson . Coming out here by yourself to meet me ... face-to-face , no backup . Let 's face facts . You and your little band of misfits are hardly S.H.I.E.L.D. Our intel says you don 't have enough manpower or artillery to take down a convenience store , so I 'm sorry . - I 'm gonna have to say no to that deal . - I don 't know . I think we 're good on artillery . And in case you get any ideas , general ... that 's just the tip of the iceberg . Let 's get out of here before the iceberg runs out of fuel . Are you ready to comply ? _ I 'm getting tired of losing our best and brightest to Hydra . - For the bad guys ... - No one leaves here alive . - ... it 's recruitment time . - I 'm well aware of who I work for . And top of their list are the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. What side did you end up on ? Did you think I wouldn 't find out ? _

 Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... I know that Agent Coulson was killed in action . Welcome to Level 7 . Some say it was only for eight seconds , but I feel different . What is Centipede ? It 's an intravenous filter for his blood . Very similar to the serum Dr. Erskine developed in the ' 40s for the ... Super-soldiers . Listen , Doctor , your product works . It appears the volatility in the serum has been neutralized . Who 's the woman you referred to ? Some rich girl in a flower dress . We all have to do things that make us uncomfortable if we are ever to get our toy soldiers off the shelf . That seat is taken . Perimeter breach ! Quad Four ! Three guys just crashed the prison ! Time to go . " Sir . " - Excuse me ? - " Time to go , sir . " It 's time to go , sir ! - Mission briefing in five . - Okay . - Katherine Shane ? - Do you know her ? We ran a few ops together in the ' 90s . Smart . Resourceful . Had a soft spot for Truffaut movies . Easy there , charm school . According to these files , Agent Shane could be my mom . Even if Shane was the agent who dropped you off at the orphanage , it doesn 't mean she 's your mother . I looked into all the female agents active when I was born . - Mmm-hmm . - Needle , haystack , I know . But then I factored in age and marital status , and then I built a program to narrow down the field . You 're still looking at a long road . It would be a lot shorter if I could access more files . Maybe you could remove my Internet nanny ? - I 'm talking about my tracking bracelet . - I got that . - So you 'll take it off ? - No . But I asked May to look into S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s more restricted files . I was kind of hoping to keep this private . Agent May specializes in private . Let 's go . Nice feint . I read your file . Know you favor your left . That 's in there ? What else ? Nothing that 's news . You don 't play well with others . I think I 've proven that I can . - More than once . - Not here . Towel down . I need you both in the command center in five . At 0800 hours , three men infiltrated the Havenworth Federal Penitentiary . infiltrated ? More like cannon-balled . They were in and out in less than two minutes . Left no prints at the scene . But we do have one lead . Centipede . It seems they salvaged some of their research from Hong Kong . So we were right . Chan 's platelets solved their combustion problem . Now they can create super-soldiers with no fear of explosion . Maybe don 't get so excited about it . Two of Centipede 's labs have been destroyed . But they keep popping back up . Now they have at least three of these guys . Maybe more . Who 'd they break out ? Edison Po . Former Marine . Expert in tactics and rapid response . He fell off the grid in ' 08 , reappeared 18 months ago at a diner in Boston . Where he stabbed a friend 's eyes out . With a steak knife . Then finished his meal . That 's funny , Po doesn 't look crazy . I 'm kidding . The guy is a walking mug shot . Which means he shouldn 't be too hard to track down . Finding Po and these Centipede soldiers is a top priority for S.H.I.E.L.D. We 'll be running point , but we won 't be working alone . What team did HQ send for backup ? Not a team . A person . Someone who can help us fight fire with fire . Somebody we worked with before ? Not exactly . Did I beat Captain America 's time ? Not even close . Excuse me . Agent Coulson ? Mr. Peterson . If you could put that bulldozer back where you found it , we need you to suit up . This is a bad idea . While I have you in a good mood , you should know that Skye 's trying to ID the agent that dropped her off at the orphanage . We agreed to protect her from the truth , so I told her you were looking into it . She may come to you . One mistake at a time . Agent Coulson . Agent May . Last time you saw her , you threw her into a brick wall . Right . First time around , I wasn 't who I wanted to be . But now I get it . Having all this , it 's a privilege . And training to be an agent , working with S.H.I.E.L.D. , it 's me trying to do better . Trying to be better . I just need you to give me a shot . Everyone deserves a second chance . But let me be clear . There will not be a third . - Understood , sir . - Good . It 's not good . At all . The guy was a ticking time bomb . Literally . HQ wouldn 't have sent him if he was still combustible . They must 've found a way to stabilize him somehow . They stabilize his attitude ? 'Cause it was pretty hostile in Union Station . Well , it 's not like we haven 't opened up our doors to other people . People with questionable track records . Not cool . But true . And don 't worry about Mike . He 's a good guy . Who 's been in the Centipede program . Exactly . He can give us some super-power backup . Just saying , this could easily go sideways . I mean , the last time we saw this guy , he was a raging , homicidal maniac ... - He 's standing right behind me , isn 't he ? - Mmm . Mr. Peterson , this is Agent Grant Ward . He 's the man who shot you at Union Station . Fitz-Simmons designed the weapon he used , - and I think you remember ... - Kidnap victim . You joined S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Yeah . Turns out , guys in suits , not so bad . Look , I know Union Station could 've gone another way . Another team might not have let me out of there alive . I owe you . All of you . That 's bygones . And water under a distant bridge . Far away . How 's your son ? Still With my sister . He thinks I 'm working construction , but he 's good . Happy . So what do we have ? Not much on Po . I checked his previously known addresses and old military contacts , came up empty . We 've been looking for where Po might be on the outside . Let 's look at his life on the inside . At the prison . See if that gets us any leads . Anything on the Centipede soldiers ? We found a facial recog match on one of them . Name 's Brian Hayward . Stationed in Afghanistan for three years , then fell off the radar when he got back . Only living relative , his sister , Laura . A sophomore at the University of Ohio . She 's our best shot at finding Hayward . You and I will go talk to her . Have May set a course for Cleveland . With all the high-tech gadgets and gizmos at our disposal , it 's easy to forget about the simple tools of the past . What can I do for you ? I 'm just curious about what you want me to do . - Where you need me . - Here . On the plane . But shouldn 't I be out in the field ? I mean , that 's why you brought me here , right ? You 'll get your chance . Right now , I need you to go down to the lab for some tests . I 'm stable . They already tested me at Sci-Ops . I know . I also know that using your powers takes a toll . I need to understand your limits . For your sake as well as my team 's . The lab 's downstairs . I have to put away four times what I used to , just to keep my energy UP - Uh , and after you use your strength ? Maybe 10 times the food ? Then I usually crash afterwards . It 's really hard on my body . Hard , body . Got it . You do know we have equipment that can take measurements . No need to do it manually . My mistake . Well , no matter , I 'll send the numbers to you straight away . I need measurements to build you a diagnostic suit so we can monitor your vitals in the field . As for fabrics , how does a polymer blend with 10 layers of treated composite material sound ? - Sounds great ? - Yeah , it does , doesn 't it ? Sorry . I 'm sorry . I was just looking at that ... Oh ... No , it 's okay . I 'm used to it . They tried to take it off me at the Sci-Ops facility . Realized they couldn 't do it without killing me . I 'm afraid we 're terribly curious . How did they stabilize the EXTREMIS in you ? - And keep you from exploding ? - Yeah . Oh , that wasn 't them . That was you two . - Come again ? - What 's that ? Your gun . It somehow froze me . Right at the moment I was about to explode . Helped my body absorb the serum , stabilize . Your weapon saved my life . All that , and it didn 't even leave a scar , so ... - Well , I should think not . - Well ... Yeah . We couldn 't have that , could we ? It would be a shame , especially when you 're so well-formed and symmetrical in the ... When did you stop talking ? About three embarrassing sentences ago . Yes . Right . " The Psychology of Women : Unraveling the Female Psyche . " - That 's an actual book ? - It 's a whole course . Hayward 's sister 's in there now . We 'll be at the school in 10 . We 'll catch her on her way out . A whole class . On women . Time was , you just had to figure them out . Solving the puzzle was half the fun . You solve a lot of puzzles in your day ? A few . Some more worth it than others . One was especially rewarding . What happened ? I died . Oh ... She wasn 't Level 7 , sir ? She was a cellist , second chair . Portland Symphony . Saw her play whenever I was in town . You ever see a beautiful woman play the cello ? Mmm-mmm . It 's something else . She laughed at my jokes , too , which was a very nice bonus . You know where she is now ? Of course I do . I 'm sorry , sir . I was gone for months . The Avengers thought I was dead so I had to keep that up . S.H.I.E.L.D. protocol . It 's probably better this way . Maybe if she 'd been part of the Agency ? In my experience , that 's just asking for trouble . Hey . Coulson told me you were helping to find my long-lost folks . So , thanks . I 'm glad you 're in on this with me . It means a lot . Right . I can tell you 're really into this . Um , I 've done a lot of the heavy lifting already . Came up with a shortlist . I thought you might want ... We 're on a mission , Skye . Is this why you called me here ? No . I was just working on this while I waited for you . Uh , I called ' cause I found something about Po . Show me . Po only had one visitor during his prison stint . Her . You notice the outfit ? Miles said a girl in a flower dress asked him to hack S.H.I.E.L.D. This could be the same girl . Can we hear the conversation ? That 's the bummer . There was no audio . But it 's not a total loss . I was able to use S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s lip reading program . Because we have one of those . It didn 't work on the girl because she never looks at the camera , but Po did . Once . And it caught this . The Clairvoyant doesn 't like to be touched . I wrote that down so we don 't have to hear that again ever . The Clairvoyant . Yeah . Does that mean anything to you ? But it means something to them . To Po and whoever that woman is . Her name 's Raina . - You know her ? - Yeah . She recruited me for Centipede . Came up to me at the hospital where I did my back therapy . Out of the blue . Told me she could change my life . Nice to cut my own meat again . The steak was to your liking ? Overcooked . And the ambience ... We 're not here for the decor . We 've stabilized the serum . Added the implant . And now we need The Clairvoyant 's help in finding the key to Stage Three . I 've asked before . The Clairvoyant has trouble seeing the man you 're looking for . And his weaknesses . I don 't mean to upset you . It 's the way of things . This is what 's upsetting me . This S.H.I.E.L.D. team has destroyed two of our operations . We move every few days now , to be safe . Which causes challenges for our maintenance problems . We can 't overstate the toll this takes on our soldiers . They 're drained after every mission . Our men need regular injections , constant upkeep . Difficult when S.H.I.E.L.D. has us on the run . Then it 's time to stop running . We 're running her through our systems . Maybe we can get an ID . But we 're guessing she 's Centipede 's recruiter and Po 's her latest recruit . Three super-soldiers dive-bomb a prison , pluck him out . He 's her number one draft pick . Why him ? Centipede 's making more soldiers . Maybe they want Po to coordinate them . Lead them . His background 's tactical strategy . He fits the bill . So these guys have super-soldiers , an expert military strategist , and a Clairvoyant who can see the future . Anyone else thinking about switching teams ? They couldn 't have a psychic . There are none on the Index . They 're a myth . So was Thor . Maybe it 's an alias . Run it through our databases . See if anything pops up . Ward is approaching Hayward 's sister now . Laura Hayward ? That 's me . Sorry to bother you , but I was hoping you could help me out . I hope so , too . I 'm looking for your brother . Brian . Have you seen him lately ? I 'm sorry . Who are you ? Ah ... Dan Filch . Ohio State Gaming Commission . We 're trying to contact Brian . Tell him the good news . - He won the lottery ? - $ 50,000 . - Really ? - Mmm-hmm . And you 're looking for him ? Don 't you guys wanna keep the money ? Sure . But we have to at least try and contact the winners before the ticket expires . Your brother 's does in six days . - So if you know where he is ... - I don 't . Sorry . We 're not close . I haven 't spoken to him since he got back from Afghanistan . Well , now you have a reason to . 50,000 reasons , actually . So , let us know if you hear from him . Okay . Not sure why you wanted to go with the lottery story , sir . - It 's a tough sell . - Exactly . Nothing makes people more suspicious than a handsome man offering them free money . She 's making the call now . Brian . It 's me . Some guy was just waiting for me at school . Said you won the lottery . I know , right ? We 're not that lucky . - Is he local ? - No . He 's in Oakland , California . Come in . Oh ... it almost looks homey . Is that Ace ? What a cutie . He must be so proud of you . His dad working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Which he can 't know with everything being classified . It 's all right . He knows I 'm working . Called him on his birthday and gave him all the Heroes of New York action figures . Nice . Are you two close ? We 're a team . I 'd do anything for this little guy . That 's got to be the best feeling . A son looking up to you . Who wants to grow up to be just like you . Yeah . Looks like he 's growing fast though . You said you wanted your shot . Here it is . I won 't let you down . - I think it 's quite smart . - How does it feel ? It feels good . Comfortable . Having powers is cheating . But the suit 's pretty cool . It 's perfect for an array of tactical missions . Yeah . Also measures your heart rate , systolic pressures and glucose levels . All while providing state-of-the-art ballistic protection . Yeah . Thanks . - Oh ! No , thank you . - We 've never been so proud . Hayward 's cell phone has been traced to an abandoned factory about eight miles from here . Probably Centipede 's new lab . It 's certainly been their MO . We destroy one factory , they set up another , putting us back to square one . This time I want answers . It means we go in quiet . Do minimal damage to the facility and the people inside . Ward , May , you 'll go in through the west entrance . Mr. Peterson and I will enter through the loading clock . You 'll run the back end from outside . We 're doing this just us ? We 've been playing Whac-A-Mole with these guys since Ward first picked me out of my van . Shouldn 't Big S.H.I.E.L.D. be sending in backup ? Trust me , they already did . Let 's move . No pressure . - We alone here ? - It appears so . The only heat signatures we 're reading are yours . But there 's a weird electronic signal . I 'm trying to isolate it . The place looks emptied out . Think we 're too late ? Fitz , dial Hayward 's number . Find out . - Uh , Sir , you 've got company ! - Yeah , we do . Coming your way ! - Usually packs a bigger punch . - Yeah . I remember . What 's happening ? His systolic and diastolic pressures are dropping . Heart rate 's plummeting as well . Sir , he 's in bad shape . Between the physical exertion and this wound , his vitals are dangerously low . Who 's behind Centipede ? Who 's doing this ? I won 't say anything . I promise . No . Please ! Don 't do ... That 's Mike Peterson . One of our first subjects . He hasn 't been injected with the serum in a while , but he still has his powers . No . What he has is your key to Stage Three . The one on the left is Akela Amador 's . Hayward 's is on the right . Now , his prosthetic was slightly damaged , but based on digital reconstruction , we can now confirm that the technology is virtually identical . Hayward 's prosthetic is the same internal power source , backscatter capabilities and biomechanics as Amador . So Centipede also designed the eye implant ? These guys are serious multitaskers . Who 's Akela Amador ? A former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent . The first person we encountered with this eye technology . A good agent who was forced to do some bad things . We helped her . Kind of a pattern with you guys . So then those soldiers at the warehouse were forced to attack us ? Through that eye thing ? They were getting orders . When the tide turned in our favor , Centipede flipped Hayward 's kill switch , told the other guys to run . Can you track the eye feed like before , find their location ? Nope . They 've upgraded since Amador . Their feed 's untraceable now . Their technology keeps advancing at a disturbingly rapid pace . They must have endless manpower , resources . And someone with a fat wallet . Po 's the strategist , Rama 's their recruiter . Perhaps this Clairvoyant 's the money . That makes sense . If I could see the future , I 'd go straight to Las Vegas . Whoever 's behind them may or may not be psychic , but they 're one step ahead of us every time . I need to update HQ . This is bigger than we thought . I spoke with The Clairvoyant . And ? I 'll share the information when the time is right . I would love to hear much more than just information . Will you tell me what he 's like ? Never . The last person who tried to learn these things got a knife for it . I don 't want to have to do that again , Raina . You have such pretty eyes . I understand . You can 't even whisper to me about him . No , I can 't . But I did tell The Clairvoyant about you . Spoke at length about your many virtues . How sweet . I 'll pour you a Scotch ? Don 't ever do that again . Brandy , then ? When we 're out in the field , your head needs to be on the op . Not on me . Time-out . Still playing catch up here . What are you talking about ? You ! Taking a punch for me ? I don 't need your protection . You think I don 't know that ? I took that punch 'cause you 're faster than me . You could do more good on your feet . It was tactical . Not personal . My mistake . I am not some recruit who can 't separate church from state . I 'm on the same page as you . So don 't flatter yourself . Sorry , I didn 't mean to crash . What do you want ? This about that thumb drive again ? - No . - Good . Look , I get that you don 't wanna help with that . Loud and clear . Big neon flashing lights . But I didn 't ask , okay ? Coulson doesn 't wanna tell you the truth . The truth is ... You have to decide why you 're here . We have a mission and it 's not to find your parents . If you can 't put aside your personal attachments , then you shouldn 't be here . - Oh , come on in . - Thanks . You doing okay ? Afraid I won 't be much good to you for the next couple days . That 's understandable . You went above and beyond at that warehouse . Had our backs more than once . Thank you , sir . But I know Centipede 's still out there . I know we still got a lot of work to do . True . But according to your S.O. , hard work 's your specialty . Said you train 24 / 7 . I wanna be the best . And that 's admirable . But you hadn 't left the training facility since you got there . Which means you haven 't seen your son since Union Station . Ace is fine . We talk all the time . But you haven 't been to see him . Why ? SKYE ' . Mike ! Because the last time he saw me , I was a monster . My kid saw that . You can 't fix that from here . And staying away , not being there ... I 've seen firsthand the kind of damage that can do . The last thing I wanna do is hurt Ace . He 's my son . But maybe he 's better off without me . I don 't think that 's true . When I took this job , I made a choice . The same choice everyone else here made . This life over the other one . The one with holiday dinners , and PTA meetings , recitals . It 's not easy . But , if the time comes to make the hard call , it 's simpler . But you have a son . You have someone waiting for you to come home . You need to think about that . You need to think about him before you make your choice . Hello ? Hey , Ace . Dad ! It is so good to hear your voice , buddy . And I got some good news . I 'm gonna get to come home and see you for a bit . Awesome ! Then maybe you can meet my new friend . She said she knows you . She 's here right now . Ace , who 's there with you ? Where 's your Aunt Mindy ? Hello , Mike . Remember when I told you I could change your life ? They wanna trade . Ace for his father . - They 've set a time and a place . - Bloody savages . They want to experiment on him . Determine how he still has his abilities . And we 're gonna let them ? We 've fought these guys before . We don 't have a choice . The instructions they gave Mr. Peterson were very specific . I called HQ , told them to stand down . - Stand down ? - So we take ' em alone . We should at least have a hostage rescue unit in support of this . They said they would murder my son . If we make one wrong move ... Any electronics , any comms , any sign of surveillance , and they 'll terminate the arrangement . I 'll give myself up , no problem , get him back . I can figure it out from there . You 're still recovering . We can 't just hand you over to them like that . Can we ? Fitz-Simmons have a non-electronic method of tracking him . Simmons has fabricated an odorless scent . I have an instrument which can detect it , works like a bloodhound . Can track someone from over 50 kilometers . After we make the trade , we 'll be able to follow Mr. Peterson . Buy him some time to get his strength back . We 'll find him . I don 't care what happens to me . As long as my boy is ... I promise you . We 're gonna get your son back . At least let me escort him out for the exchange . Mr. Peterson requested me . I 'm comfortable with that . And if things go south , I need you back here taking point on the team . Is Ward in position ? Yes . But I don 't like any of this . There 'd be something wrong with you if you did . Once the swap happens , I 'll fire up my equipment . We 'll be able to track you wherever they take you . Just don 't do anything that 'll endanger my son . We won 't . But we wanna make sure Ace has his dad at the end of the day , too . Time to go . My team won 't let you down . It wasn 't supposed to go down like this . I 'm gonna make this right , I swear . Damn it . Hello , Mike . It 's been a while . Your son is adorable . And he looks just like you . I don 't believe I 've had the pleasure . Lucky for you . I have to thank you , Mike . For holding up your end of the deal . Let 's just make the trade . Give us Ace and you can have him . Oh , that wasn 't the deal . I 'm so sorry . Let me know when I can activate comms and the tracker . What 's happening here , Mike ? Well , in exchange for his son , we asked Mike to deliver you . I 'm not at full strength , but I can still crush your throat . New deal ! My son for your life ! Sadly , my employer cares no more for my life than your son 's . If I die , so does he . And his death will be so much worse . You need to let her go . I told them they could have me . But they want you . Why do they want you ? I don 't know . But if you kill this woman , you 'll never see your son again . But how will I look him in the eye ? How will I explain what I did ? We talked about this . I 'm so sorry . Let 's finish this . Dad ! There 's his son . Oh , thank God . I have no stomach for this . On my mark , activate comms and tracker . If there 'd been any other way ... You made the only choice you had . What happened ? They took Coulson . All right , call it in . We need back up . I have a shot . Do not engage . They 'll kill Coulson . Stand down , I 'll contact HQ . Are you okay ? I 'm fine , Dad . S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ , this is S.H.I.E.L.D. R.G. 422 . We need immediate satellite support . Ace , I gotta make something right . Daddy loves you so much . Okay ? Stay with Skye . You remember Skye , right ? Keep him safe . Take care of my boy ! No ! Mike ! Where 's Coulson ? Oh , my God . Coulson . We land in half an hour . Good . The sooner we begin , the better . Whatever this is , whatever you think you 're doing , it won 't work . I won 't give you what you want . You will . And what we want is simple . We want you to tell us about the day after you died .

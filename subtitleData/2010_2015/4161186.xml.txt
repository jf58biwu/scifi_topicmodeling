Let 's skip the party . No , no , no , no , no . You said we were late . ( Guard ) Invitation card , please . ( Iori ) Excuse me ? ( Mr Big ) Oh , Sorry , Mr. Yagami . You don 't need an invitation . ( Junior Oficer ) Uh , I think ... We just lost camera seven . ( Terry ) Do you know where I was ? Stationed before this ? ( Junior Oficer ) Afghanistan . ( Terry ) That 's right , Afghanistan . Million-dollar surveillance equipment Sent to the hills of Tora Bora , thousands of miles Away from civilization . Anything I wanted was a phone call away . So could somebody please tell to me how I can be in The most technologically advanced Country in the world , and not get one Decent surveillance camera ? ( Junior Oficer ) I don 't ... ( Chizuru ) Iori ... I 'm so glad you could finally make it . ( Iori ) I am so sorry we 're late . Chizuru , this Is Mai Shiranui . ( Mai ) It 's so wonderful to finally meet you . Oh , I understand . Congratulations Are in order . Well , thank you very much . You 've come a long way this past year . I can 't remember When we 've had a Fighter quite so driven . Well , now that you 're Here , I guess we can begin . Truth be told , I 'm a little nervous . ( Iori ) What 's going on ? Well , these artifacts have never been Displayed like this . Well then , Why risk it ? If anything should happen ... Takao Iwata insisted . He 's in financial control of the tournament , and It 's no secret he Likes to show off . I just have to make sure the security we 've put in Place is adequate . ( Terry ) Does she know about our cameras ? ( Junior Oficer ) I , uh , don 't think so , ( Iori ) Thank you . ( Mai ) WOW ... Look at you . The way they treat you , you 'd think You were the king of fighters . I 've been retired way too long . No , I 've been invited because I 'm the last of The Yagami clan . You never told me why you retired so early . It 's complicated . Well , you 're a complicated guy , Iori . I wouldn 't expect It to be simple . Another time . Promise ? I will . Hey , that 's not a promise . I will . Come on . ( Chizuru ) I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. Iwata . Please , follow me . ( Iori ) Come with me . Come on . Best seats in the house . ( Iori ) There they are , The treasures of the clans . These make the king Of fighters tournament possible . ( Iori ) You need to take that ? No , I don 't . You have my full attention tonight , I 'm sorry . Sit down . Well , the secret ... Of the treasures are meant to be Kept within the clans . ( Mai ) Oh . But I can tell you a little . Okay . The Yasakani no Magatama was created By my ancestors . Almost 2,000 years ago . At that time , the necklace possessed ... The energy to unlock the door . It 's the key . The yata mirror is the door ... And it was the yata clan who first created the mirror . Chizuru is the last descendant of that clan . And do you remember what happens uh , when you Direct the energy of the necklace into the shield ? You unlock the passageway to the other dimension Exactly . But I still don 't Understand . I mean ... You have a necklace and a mirror ... It 's not logical . How ? Oh , miss logical , I forgot . Iori , we 're using earpieces . I mean , how does that even happen ? Look , I know it doesn 't look like much , But that 's the point . Chizuru 's father was a genius , and he was able to Consolidate the existing energy waves from these Artifacts and condense them into The earpieces we 're using today . Now , at the push of a button , we 're able to ... Enter another dimension . Wow . I know , it 's crazy . Well , what about that third one ? It 's the kusanagi sword ... The most important of the treasures . Only the sword ... can defeat the Orochi . What is that ? ( Iori ) The Orochi is a spirit , or a demon , That was banished to the dimension 1800 years ago . Legend has it promising unlimited power to Anyone that frees it , but he would have to possess All three treasures to do so . ( Mai ) what would happen If he was freed ? That 's a lesson for another day , when you 're ready Hopefully soon . ( Guard ) I 'm looking to do more I think I need to ( Terry ) Go ! Go , go , go , go ! Let 's get a closer look , okay ? What ? Who Is That ? Come on . ( Rugal ) Chizuru ... How are you , Rugal ? ( Guard ) Excuse me . ( Rugal ) Peek-a-boo . ( Terry ) Go ! ( Iori ) Chizuru ... ( Iori ) She 's hurt bad . ( Mai ) Chizuru , look at me , look at me . ( Chizuru ) Where 's Rugal ? ( Mai ) He 's down . Don 't worry , relax . ( Chizuru ) The relics ... ( Chizuru ) He wants ... back in . ( Iori ) The relics are ... ( Iori ) Call for help . ( Mai ) We need an ambulance ! ( Mai ) Call 911 ! ( Rugal ) Iori ! ( Rugal ) Come with me . Remember what waits for us on the other side . I can 't , and I can 't let you either . Okay . More for me then . ( Rugal ) Wouldn 't it be ironic if i was to kill You now with this sword ? ( Terry ) Come out with your hands up ! ( Rugal ) God ... ( Agent # 1 ) Stay Down ! Hands above your head ! ( Terry ) No , Go , Go ! It 's the other guy , It 's the other guy . ( Rugal ) Thanks for the lesson , Chizuru . ( Agent # 1 ) No way out . He 's trapped . ( Terry ) Okay , are there any windows ? ( Terry ) Wait ! Back off ! Back off ! ( Iori ) You 're letting him get away ! Let me in there before it 's too late . ( Terry ) Back off ! ( Iori ) Rugal ... ( Iori ) ... STOP ! ( Terry ) Get on the ground ! ( Terry ) What the hell was that ? ( Iori ) He didn 't take the sword . ( Chizuru ) The sword is a fake . ( Mai ) What ? Rugal 's going back in . People will die if you don 't find the real one . Chizuru , It 's just a game . Not if someone submits to the Orochi . It 'll ... It 'll turn into a death match . Find Saisyu Kusanagi . When you do , you 'll find the real sword . ( Chizuru ) Without the true Kusanagi sword , Rugal cannot Free the Orochi , and if he did , he would be unstoppable . ( Mai ) I 'll tell Iori . ( Chizuru ) No , you can 't . It 's too dangerous . Iori should stay out of this . You must go alone . Me ? Chizuru , I don 't ... I know who you are . Iori can 't be involved . You have to trust me . Please . Excuse me . Hi . I understand you have a patient here , Named Saisyu Kusanagi . I 'd like to speak to him . ( Berta ) You want to talk to Saisyu Kusanagi ? That 's right . Okay . ( Berta ) Mr. Kusanagi ... hasn 't responded to anyone For almost 10 years . He eats , he walks , he sleeps , But the last thing he 'll do is talk . He lives in his own lonely world . Have a nice talk . ( Mai ) Thank you . Mr. Kusanagi ? ( Mai ) Mr. Kusanagi ? ( sighs ) God ... What now ? ( Kyo ) May I help you ? I 'm Mai ... Shiranui . I came here looking for mr . Kusanagi , but I Wasn 't aware of his condition . I 'm his son , Kyo Kusanagi . His son ? I didn 't ... I didn 't realize . Uh ... Chizuru sent me , and , uh ... She was injured in a fight , and I came instead , And two of the relics have been stolen , and ... Wait , wait , wait , hold on . Who sent you ? Chizuru . Kagura ? You must know her . No , I ... I don 't . I 'm sorry that she was injured And you ... your relics were stolen , But I don 't know what you 're talking about . But , you 're Saisyu 's son . Yes . If you don 't mind , it 's time for my father to rest ( Mai ) Of course . Come on , dad , It 's time to lay down . ( Kyo ) The highest form of goodness is like water . Water knows how to benefit all things Without striving with them . It stays in places loathed by all men . Therefore , it comes near the Tao . In choosing your dwelling , Know how to keep to the ground . In cultivating your mind , Know how to dive In the hidden depths ( Saisyu ) Good . ( Kyo ) ( V / O ) We make a vessel from a lump of clay It is the empty space within the vessel That makes it useful . We make doors and windows for a room , But it is these empty spaces that make the room livable . Thus while it is the tangible has advantages , It is the intangible that makes it useful . ( Birdsong ) Mai . Iori ! You scared me . Where have you been ? I 've been worried about you . I didn 't mean to worry you . ( Iori ) Why didn 't you tell me where you were going ? I mean , you just disappeared . Well , you didn 't talk to Chizuru ? ( Iori ) I didn 't talk to Chizuru . I 'm sorry , I thought that you might have . She sent me . She said ... something about ... A relic went missing , and ... and ... And I had to come here and find ... find this Kusanagi guy , And that I 'd be helping you , and ... Oh , I 'm so glad to see you . Listen to me , you have no idea what you 're Involved with right now . Okay , there 's no point being here . Let 's go . He has a son . Kyo , you have visitors . ( Kyo ) What now ?

And you 've sent out a warning to the fighters ? Yes . Excellent . ( Scott ) Except ... There 's been an override . From whom ? ( Scott ) Rugal . Dammit . He 's trying to take control of the tournament , But how ? Actually , it 's quite fascinating . Somehow , Rugal was able to assume control of the fighting Line-up from inside the other dimension . He 's challenging everyone . ( Chizuru ) They don 't know they 're playing With their own lives . ( Mature ) So we 're alone now . ( Vice ) I 'm up . ( Mature ) But remember the message we got ? No one 's supposed to accept challenges until Chizuru authorizes it . Both of us ? I 've never heard of two fighters Entering at at the same time . Well , this could be our chance , two against one Can you have two king of fighters ? There 's a first time for everything . ( Vice ) Wait , what 's happened ? ( Mature ) I don 't know . Something 's wrong . Vice and mature . I knew you two would have ... The balls to accept my challenge . ( Vice ) Who are you ? ( Rugal ) Who am I ? Oh , ho-ho ... I 'm the King of Fighters ! Rugal ! Watch out , here I come , ladies . Welcome to Rugal 's Version of the tournament . In this arena , I make all the rules . ( Mature ) You can 't change the rules .

( Rugal ) Whoo ! No , those didn 't work . Where were we ? Oh , yeah . Let 's fight . ( Rugal ) Ah ... ( Rugal ) ... that was good . ( Rugal ) Bring it . ( Rugal ) Come on , let 's dance . ( Vice ) Stop , don 't ! You 've won ! ( Rugal ) You two are no fun . Two girls , one guy ? It 's supposed to be every man 's fantasy . Why don 't you just take the badge ?

( Mature ) No ... What have you done ? Let 's just say she 's bonded , And you 're under contract . Now , you 've got a job to do . Welcome to Rugal Inc . Ramon ? It 's Vice . Yeah , I just got out of the tournament . I know , but it 's fine . Rugal has improved the gameplay . He 's going to be calling you next . You should totally do it ... Hey , shermie , just letting you know you can Totally take the challenges . I mean , I lost , but it was a lot of fun . Believe me , Duo Lon , it 's safe . ( Vice ) No ! No ! Get away from me ! ( Terry ) Terry Bogard ... CIA ( Scott ) Thanks for looking ... Over my blog , but I got to get going . Not so fast there , supergeek . I need some answers . ( Terry ) Give me this . ( Chizuru ) Scott , give mr . Bogard the laptop . ( Terry ) Yeah , Scott . Type in the password . No . Scott ... There 's a cell in Gitmo with your name on it . Type in the password . Well , the CIA can 't do that anymore . Yeah , I know . It sucks . You want to tell me about this ? Wait a second , How 'd you do that ? I 'm CIA You 're the one who had me under surveillance . That 's classified . And who failed to stop Rugal ? Actually , we stopped him from stealing Your Kusanagi sword , Thank you very much . It 's too bad the sword was a fake . Nice try . Look , this guy 's a murderer , he 's on the loose . I just want to know where he is . It 's complicated . Let me guess , he 's hiding in your Secret little tournament . See , that 's right . I know all about it . Is that so ? Then Why do you need me ? Cause I don 't know where it is . So , where is it ? The tournament takes place in another dimension . Don 't give me that bullshit about dimensions . Well ... Actually , string theory supports the Idea of over 10 or 11 different ... Dimensions , occupying the same ... Time capsule as this one . You got beat up a lot as a kid , didn 't you ? No . Mr. Bogard ... I could tell you everything you want to know ... But it doesn 't mean you 'll believe me . At this point , you know what ? Try me . Rugal 's hiding in the tournament dimension . He 's been consumed by the Orochi , and he 's trying To lure fighters in there to kill them . Okay ... Why is that ? So he can be King of fighters . Other dimension , King of Tooth Fairies . Look , I 'm trained to believe in the tangible , Not the bullshit story you 're telling me . People are dying ... And you want me to believe you and your crazy stories ? No . But you 'll believe Mai . Who 's Mai ? The undercover operative you assigned to infiltrate Our organization a year ago . Oh , that Mai . She 's in Seattle . If you don 't believe me , go talk to her . She 'll confirm everything I 'm telling you . You know we 're wasting our time here . Chizuru sent me here for a reason . Yeah , To find Saisyu . He 's dead , it 's time to move on now . What about Kyo ? Kyo is a half-breed . He 's not a true Kusanagi . Iori , what is the Orochi ? Really ? What is it ? You wouldn 't understand . It 's pure evil . Iori , you have to learn how to trust me . Tell me more . It can give you great strength and power That 's addictive and destructive . Eventually , it consumes you , and you can 't shake it . Is that why you left ? Where did he go ? ( Kyo ) What did you do to my father ? ( Mai ) Kyo , he didn 't do anything . My father was completely unresponsive for 10 years , And you walk in , he wakes up and tries to kill you . Why ? It 's about our families . He was a Kusanagi ... And you 're a Yagami . Then you understand . We 're destined to be enemies . What was that about ? He can 't help us , Mai . And you won 't . I don 't know what 's worse . Mai ... Look , just let me talk to him . He has to know something . I have to try . ( Mai ) You got room for one more ? I don 't think I 'm going your way . If you 're looking for answers , I 'll tell you everything I know , and Then I 'll leave it up to you to make the next move . Fair ? ( Kyo ) What , did you break it ? ( Mick O 'Merai ) I didn 't break it . ( Kyo ) Well then , what 's wrong with it ? ( Mick ) It 's broke , but I didn 't do it . ( Mick ) Whoa . Wow . You got to be about the prettiest thing That Kyo 's brought around here . All right , come on , help me figure out what You did wrong to this thing . ( Mick ) What I did wrong ? ( Kyo ) It was working fine when I left . Okay , let 's see here . Well , this is wrong ... ( Kyo ) All right , start her up . ( Mick ) Sounds good . ( Kyo ) No , it sounds terrible . Just take it for a test drive anyway . I 'm sorry about your father . Why are you here ? Don 't you want to know more about him ? What could you tell me about my father that I Don 't already know ? Do you know what happened to him ? Yeah , the tournaments , that 's what happened to him . How much do you know about the tournaments ? You fight , too , don 't you ? I asked you a question . Are you going to answer me ... ( Mai ) Oh ! Shit . Kyo , I 'm sorry ! ( Kyo ) Oh , it 's ... It 's okay . I 'm fine . ( Kyo ) I think it 's dislocated . ( Mai ) Kyo , I 'm sorry . Lay down , lay down , lay down . Breathe . Relax . ( Kyo ) Don 't touch me . ( Mai ) Relax . ( Kyo ) Don 't ... Don 't ... No , Please , don 't touch me . ( Mai ) Relax , breathe . I know What I 'm doing . Look at me . ( Mai ) Better ? ( Kyo ) Yeah . ( Mai ) Try your arm . ( Kyo ) Wow . Yeah , that 's ... that 's better . ( Mai ) Good . You still haven 't told me what It is you 're you 're doing here . I 'm looking for a sword . What sword ? Well , it 's yours , but it seems you don 't Know much ... about your family history . The Kusanagi clan history ? It 's just a bunch of legends And fairy tales to entertain children . What about what Iori said ? That you and he were destined to be enemies . Your boyfriend didn 't tell you ? He 's not ... All right . The way the story goes , As far as I know it , Is that it was one of his ancestors From the Yagami clan who first tried to release the Orochi . He wanted to be the King Of Fighters and harness its power . Instead , it consumed him with a murderous rage . So the clans united , and one of my ancestors killed Him and returned the Orochi back to its world . So they say . Well , it 's happening again . That 's why I 'm here . You really believe that stuff ? Listen , Kyo , someone is trying to harness the Orochi power , And if Rugal succeeds , we may never be able to stop him . What is it ? Do you know where I can find Rugal ? ( Mai ) Why ? Because he 's the one who destroyed my father 's mind ( Mai ) Are you sure ? ( Kyo ) I 'm sure , and I 'm going to make him pay for what he did . ( Iori ) Did you get what you needed ? Let 's go ... ( Mai ) Iori ... we need your help , okay ? I don 't know enough . You have to talk to him . Please . ( Kyo ) What can you tell me about Rugal ? Where 's the sword ? ( Kyo ) I don 't know . Let 's go . ( Mai ) Iori ... ( Terry ) Hey , buddy . Well , it looks like we have a little party here . How come I wasn 't invited ? We were on our way out . Whoa , whoa , whoa , where you going ? You going to introduce me to your friends ? I think they also might want to know that Rugal is Killing people in the tournament . A string of bodies ... All members of this tournament . Now , I know this guy Rugal 's involved . Wait , Rugal ? That 's the guy who tried to kill my father . Well , we have to stop him . I need your help . From what I 've been told , the only way is to Find the sword . ( Terry ) The sword ... ( Kyo ) A sword ? Really ? Wow , that 's just fantastic . It 's the Kusanagi sword . All right , it 's a myth , okay ? You ... You supposedly combine it with ... You 're a disgrace to the Kusanagi family . Excuse me ? Everything 's a joke to you . Who the hell do you think you are ? You don 't know anything about me . What ... what is this ? Huh ? You promised me some answers , and I got to deal with guy ? Look , let 's ... Let 's make this simple . Just tell me where I can find Rugal . It 's not simple . He 's in another dimension . Oh ! Here we go with the dimensions bullshit . Dimension . There 's only one dimension . Dimensions , dimension . Nobody travels to another dimension And fights in underground tournaments . It doesn 't happen . Thank you . I have . Oh , of course you have . Have you lost your frigging mind ? Y-you actually believe you 've gone to Another dimension ? That 's it . That 's it . Terry ... No , I 'm taking you off the case . ( Iori ) Wait a minute . What ? What did you say ? He 's taking you off this case ? Wow , this just keeps getting better and better . Tell me something , Mai , is there anyone in this room That you haven 't lied to yet ? ( Mai ) Iori ... It 's too dangerous , you know that . Let go . Let go . That 's pretty good , huh ? Agent Shiranui ? That was good . ( Rugal ) Ah , Iori ... ( Iori ) Rugal , I got to say , I love what you 've done with the place . ( Rugal ) Aw ... cute . Look , girls , Iori 's come to play . Disappointed , Rugal ? Actually , I can 't think of anyone else Who 'd appreciate what I 'm doing more than you . Well , I came to stop you . I don 't think so . You ... Come on , let 's be honest , you have issues . I got issues . Wow . Well , I got my issues under control , but , uh , you , um ... Enough . Well , you just going to stand there And keep talking , or are you going to come down and fight ? Who said anything about me fighting ? And it begins . Come on . Where 's the old Iori I know and love ? Aaaagh ! There he is . Bravo ! That 's the spirit . Accept it . You know its power , what it feels like . Do it ... Do it ! Together , we can be invincible . No one will stop us ! ( Mai ) Iori ? Iori ? ( Mai ) Iori ? Iori ... Your eyes ... Stay away from me ! Find the sword . Man , this is crazy . You locate Rugal , you know where to find me . ( Terry ) Mai , really , don 't beat yourself up . ( Mai ) No , I 'm not . You should , though . Really ? Yeah . Hey , I 'm not the one pitting two of our Suspects together in a vicious love triangle that Threatens to unleash an evil force into our world , Potentially unraveling the fabric of our universe . I mean , I don 't know , if I was you , and That were true , I might feel a little guilty . I should have told him sooner . He 'll never forgive me now . Yes , he will . Thanks . Which one are we talking about ? You 're such a jerk . You were doing what you were supposed to do . You were doing your job . Yeah , some job . Making people hate me . Nah , that 's not why they hate you . Probably hates you because you went Awol , and you didn 't disclose your involvement In a secret , inter-dimensional , Underground fighting tournament . No , wait a minute , That 's why I hate you ! I hate you . Sorry , but no joking , you 're going to Have to take the lead on this , because , quite Frankly , I don 't have a lead . Yeah . Listen , I think we should start with Kyo . We 'll go to see him tomorrow . We need to have him on board . I 'll deal with Iori later . Why does this place smell ? We 're on a budget . It 's an old abandoned fish cannery . ( Mai ) It 's a field office in a fish cannery ? ( Terry ) Hey , nothing but the best for the CIA You have no idea what it means to be a Kusanagi . Now , why do you say that ? You have Kusanagi blood running through you . It 's your responsibility , your destiny to be ... to Face the Orochi , but you don 't want to accept it . You 're afraid . No , I just don 't believe in your stories . Take it for a spin . You 're not Mai . I must have the wrong number . This is the tournament , isn 't it ? You 're new at this . This is what we do here , right ? We fight ? That 's not fighting . Technically , that 's you taking a beating . Tell you what I 'm going to do , I 'm going to let you live . Go and tell your friends ... That I promise to stop all the murder . Just get back here and fight . Let 's have some fun . ( Mai ) Iori ! You could have killed him . I just don 't understand . What am I supposed to do ? These people ... They think I 'm something I 'm not . That 's it , huh ? It 's best to be like water , which benefits the 10,000 things . That 's what I 'll do . How did you find me here ? Well , I knew you 'd be looking for answers . Are you okay ? I just don 't understand what he saw in that place . My father was a man of peace . All I saw was evil . It wasn 't always that way . What do you see in there ? I don 't know , a place where I can be me . Can 't you be yourself here ? Can you ? You know , one lost soul can recognize another I thought you were just after the sword . I 'm looking for a lot of things . What do you want from me ? I need your help . Why ? Because my last name is Kusanagi ? No , because you are the last Kusanagi . I 'm not who you want me to be . My father was the last of the clan , and And Rugal destroyed all that . The Kusanagi Clan is over . I don 't know that your father would agree with that . He gave you the name . What makes you think that I can succeed ? Where Saisyu failed ? I repair motorcycles , I 'm not a hero . Kyo , I don 't know what you are . You don 't even know what you are . That 's something you 'll have to discover , But right now , we have to stop Rugal , And we 're going to do it with or without you . You did what ? Look , I don 't know what 's going on with these things After I saw what it did to the Kusanagi kid , I had to do something . ( Mai ) So you used Chizuru 's list to steal Them from the fighters ? Come on , we 're CIA , it 's called " confiscate . " Confiscate ? I trusted you with that . She trusted me . While you 're out there getting romantic with These guys , I 'm here trying to investigate this thing . So if there is some other dimension , like you say , Maybe I just stopped the only way in , right ? ( Chizuru ) No , you haven 't . Chizuru ... thank you for coming . What is she doing here ? She trusts me . ( Chizuru ) We 've no time to lose . Rugal is becoming more and more powerful , And I 'm afraid your plan to stop him won 't work . Ah , that 's because there 's no other dimension , right ? No , it 's because Rugal is close To merging our two worlds . What do you mean ? Well ... well , actually , it 's kind of cool ... Ah , here we go again . No , you see ... these dimensions ... Dimensions , see ? I told you there was more than one . ( Scott ) These dimensions exist in what could more Accurately be described as a multi verse ... Or parallel universe . You see , Rugal was able to get access to An exact replica of our plane of existence . This means he can use a portal to force Fighters into the tournament . ( Rugal ) Hey ... We have an appointment . ( Scott ) She 's in there . This is all happening in real-time . This is amazing . You had the sword this whole time ? Iori , not now . Look ... You barge into my life And demand the only connection I had to my father . Did you really expect me just to hand it over ? It 's here now , and I 'm ready to go in . Kyo , I 'm sorry for what happened to your Father , but you must be careful not to let your Anger get the best of you . I know . Just , believe in yourself . I will . I 'm sorry , Iori , it 's too dangerous . You need me . Fighting Rugal will be hard enough . If ... if you succumb to the Orochi ... Which is not going to happen this time . I 'm strong enough . Then use your strength to do the right thing . Please . I 'm going in there . You don 't even believe in orders . Well , it 's about time I start . Show us how these things work , Scotty . Iori , if we don 't come back ... destroy everything . ( Mai ) Terry ! What are you doing here ? I 'm your partner . What do you think , I 'm just going to leave you ? ( Rugal ) Welcome to my humble ... abode . Chizuru ? Good to see you . For a while there , I thought you wouldn 't make it . All this because you want to be king of fighters ? I am king of fighters . Then why don 't you stop all of this and Come back to the real world ? This world is all I need . Here , I 'm immortal . This isn 't life . This is where we come to challenge ourselves And learn , so we can be better in the real world . When my world expands and merges with yours , this will be the real world . I 'll be king of everything . I 'm invincible . You 're not invincible ... Not as long as we have the sword . The Kusanagi sword ? Saisyu was my father . Kusanagi ... Well , well . This is just beautiful . It 's over , Rugal . Oh , no . No . The fun has just begun . ( Chizuru ) Kyo ! You can do this . ( Scott ) They got separated . Kyo 's fighting Rugal alone . ( Mai ) Oh , God ... Where are you ? ( Chizuru ) Hurry , find the other treasure pieces . Do you know what this place is ? This was your father 's favorite level . ( Rugal ) It was your father 's favorite setting . He tried to kill you , didn 't he ? ( Kyo ) No , it was the Orochi . It controlled him . It made him do that . My father would never hurt me . My father loved me ! ( Rugal ) Come on , this is boring . Let 's mix it up a bit . I don 't know ... too violent . Ooh , that 's a bit barbaric , isn 't it ? Hey , this is more like it . Batter up . Terry ? Terry ... Oh , man . Maybe you did travel to another dimension . Thrilled you 're on board . This must be what Chizuru was talking about . The worlds are merging . Find a door ! ( Announcer ) Now battling , number 36 , Rugal ! ( Rugal ) Nice sword you 've got there . I 've got to get myself one of those ! ( Rugal ) Enough games . ( Rugal ) Aw , Iori , you 've come back ! Now the real games begin . ( Terry ) Mai ! Wrong door , I think ! ( Mai ) You think ? ( Announcer ) Round one ! Rugal versus Iori ! ( Announcer ) Ready , Go ! ( Terry ) Mai ! ( Mai ) Little busy here . ( Terry ) Okay , now ! ( Terry ) Mai , look out ! ( Mai ) Whew . Terry ? ( Terry ) All these damn doors . Why are we chasing them ? ( Mai ) They 'll lead us back to him . Just keep up ! ( Terry ) Mai , wait ! ( Terry ) Mai ! You 're defending him ? Do you even know who he is ... or what he has done ? The history of the clans doesn 't matter anymore . Not clan history , his history with your father ! The precious Chizuru called a special Meeting of the clans . Iori , he was just a newcomer , but a Yagami , And protector alongside your father , Saisyu . Know this ... I fought the best , and was ready to Take what was rightfully mine , but Saisyu wouldn 't Allow it , because I had done what no one else Would dare do , harness the power of the Orochi ... And if your father wasn 't going to Give me my throne , then I was going to take it ! Everyone was afraid of the Orochi , Afraid of its power , except Rugal . The clans were no match for me . And Iori , well ... He just couldn 't stand losing . So he used the Orochi . But he couldn 't control it . Poor guy . And in a fit of rage , destroyed The mighty Saisyu Kusanagi . What did you do ? Iori , no ! Stop hiding , Iori . Now you are free . Why did you lie to me ? Huh ? I can 't control it ! Let go ! ( Mai ) Kyo ! Aaagh ! This is no fun anymore . ( Kyo ) You all right ? ( Mai ) Yeah . Iori ... You ? ( Rugal ) So touching . It 's good to see the team back together again . ( Chizuru ) Not so fast , Rugal . ( Rugal ) Chizuru . You 've been busy . And I see you 've brought toys . ( Chizuru ) It took ... some time , But we found the remaining pieces . You think you know everything about the treasures You don 't . This is your last chance , Rugal . ( Rugal ) Before what ? ( Chizuru ) Kyo , raise your sword . ( Chizuru ) Iori ! ( Rugal ) I 'm too powerful now . Your precious treasures won 't work on me ! ( Mai ) Rugal ! ( Rugal ) Is there no one here ... ( Rugal ) ... To challenge me ! Where have you been ? All these damn doors . Shit . ( Terry ) Oh , I got this . Mai ? M ... Mai ! ( Rugal ) Come on , Iori , come fight me . ( Iori ) Stop , Rugal . I know what you 're trying to do , And it won 't work this time . ( Kyo ) I 'm not strong enough . ( Iori ) You have to be . We don 't have a choice . ( Kyo ) What if I 'm not ? Then we all die . Oh , great pep talk . ( Chizuru ) No . Mai . Okay . You 're going to be fine . No way out . Damn it . ( Chizuru ) We 're too late . No , I can do this , okay ? Just show me how . I can 't do it without you Listen to me . There 's no way back for me . You know that . I need you to take my place . Who is it you think I am ? I 'm not you , okay ? I can 't . I never will be . I don 't need you to be me . I need you to be you . ( Rugal ) You need me ! Aaaagh ! ( Rugal ) It 's on , babe . I 'm going to have so much fun playing with you . ( Kyo ) Play with this . ( Rugal ) I 'm not done with you yet , Kusanagi ! ( Rugal ) He tried to kill you , didn 't he ? ( Rugal ) I 'm too powerful now . ( Rugal ) Not clan history , his history with your father ! ( Rugal ) Get up . ( Terry ) So , what are you going to do ? ( Kyo ) Well , I guess we should keep up with the tradition . Continue with the tournament . Really ? Wow , Chizuru would be very happy . Well , technically , we could start it today . I mean , all I 'd have to do is just , uh , Reconfigure the data ... and if you Guys still have the earpieces , we can ... Hey , guys , where you going ? W ... wait ! ( Saisyu ) My son ... It is time to face your destiny . This journey has brought you true friends . Trust them . Water knows how to benefit all things , Without striving with them . It stays in places loathed by all men . Therefore , it comes near the Tao ... Subtitle by Drabis _ 82 . Subscene rules !

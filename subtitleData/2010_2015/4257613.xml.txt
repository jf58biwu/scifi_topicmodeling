No , this is definitely something . Red reading . Warm blood . I think it 's human . That 's gotta be a Sixer . And if there 's one , there 's bound to be more . Better get Wash on the line . There !

It 's okay . - Calm down , all right ? ! - Nobody 's gonna hurt you ! Wash ? Where is she ? She is right over there . - She 's here ? - Yeah . Hi . She 's terrified . I need to get everybody out of here and just clear some space for us , all right ? That includes you . Understood , but I want to talk to her , Doc . Okay , just give me a few minutes alone with her , all right ? Hey , little one , don 't be frightened . No one 's gonna hurt you . I 'm Dr. Shannon . Do you know where you are ? Under a table . Sorry about my colleagues . I don 't think they meant to scare you . They want to give me a shot . Don 't like shots . Do you have a name ? If I tell you , can I go ? Perhaps . Once I 've taken a look at you . Why don 't you come out here and talk to me ? No . Okay . What if I promised no shots , just this ? It 's just a light . Won 't hurt you . Look . ( device trilling ) Would you come out then , yeah ? Okay . Okay . I lost my bag . In the jungle ? They were chasing me , and I dropped it . Don 't like chases . Well , that 's okay . We can get somebody to go look for your bag . ( device trills ) So , you gonna tell me your name ? Leah Marcos . So , do you have somebody waiting for you back at home ... or camp ? What about your mother ? Dead . Pleural sar ... Pleural sarcoma ? I 'm sorry . And your father ? Slasher got him . Mira says it happens sometimes . TAYLOR : Anybody hungry ? Been awhile since you 've eaten ? Only get scraps . That 's why I ran away . I 'm gonna stay with my nana . She always had a lot of food . Does Nana live in Terra Nova ? 9007 Newberry Avenue , apartment C , district ten , New Texas . I tried to find the portal , but I got turned around backwards . Which way is it ? Finish your food . We 'll talk about it later . ( comm device chirps ) Taylor here . Talk to me . BRADY : Perimeter is clear , over . Copy that . Taylor out . Commander Taylor ? That 's would be me . You 're the bad man . You know , I remember you . Marcos . Leah Marcos . Been a long time since I 've seen you . Last time I saw you , you were just about that big . You were just a peanut . I grew . So you did . You know , there was a time when I knew everybody 's name in Terra Nova : man , woman and peanut . You got a brother , right ? Sam . Well , her BMI is lower than I 'd like it to be , and I 'd like to get some more fluids in her , but she 's generally healthy . I 'm going now . - Leah ! - Whoa ! - Hold on there , kiddo . - It 's okay , Leah , Leah . This is my husband , right ? This is Jim . It 's okay . You 're all right , okay ? Listen , Leah , we got something we need to tell you . ELISABETH : I need you to listen to me carefully , Leah , okay ? You know the portal ? It doesn 't go both ways . What ? Once you come through , you can 't go back . You 're lying ! I 'm sorry , sweetheart . So I can 't go see my grandma ? No , I 'm afraid you can 't . Where do I go now ? I can 't stay here , not with the bad man . And I can 't go back to Mira 's . She 'll ... she 'll hurt me for running away . That is one tough young lady . Imagine that , humping through the jungle on her own from God knows where . It 's amazing she made it as far as she did . You know , this could turn out to be a very good thing for us . How do you mean ? Oh , we need intel on the Sixers . Where is it they hide out ? Who 's their inside man here in Terra Nova ? But she 's just a kid . I mean , how much could she really know ? Well , we won 't know anything till we gain her trust , make her feel at home . How 's she doing ? You know , she 's still upset , but I think I managed to calm her down . You do seem to have that effect on her . You know , till we find her a permanent place to live , she 's gonna need somewhere to stay . Well , she can stay with us . Right , Jim ? Elisabeth ? So , what , our family 's six now ? Come on . She can have Josh 's room . He 'll be fine on the couch for a while . It 's settled then . Very good . Why do I have to give up my room ? Because Zoe 's six and I 'm a girl , Josh . What does that have to do with anything ? ( door opens , Elisabeth speak quietly ) Okay , shush . That 's them . ( snap fingers ) Be nice . ELISABETH : Hey , everyone . JIM : Hey . Josh , come here . Hey . Everyone , this is Leah Marcos . Leah , this is our son , Josh . Hello . Welcome . And this is our eldest daughter , Maddy . She 's gonna be starting an apprenticeship at the infirmary with me tomorrow . Hi . And this is our youngest , Zoe . You know , Zoe 's got a plant that eats bugs , and in her spare time , she makes these toy dinosaurs . Pretty cool , huh ? Well , uh , bathroom 's through there . And the kitchen 's over there , in case you get hungry again . ( chuckles ) Um , do you want to see where you 're gonna sleep ? ELISABETH : Enough blankets , I think . ( lamp whirs ) It 's okay . It 's only light . Here , make the bed up . ( whispers ) : We should ... probably let her sleep . Yeah , okay . I don 't even know what the kid 's bag is supposed to look like . My guess ? Dirty .

( grunts ) ( both grunt ) ( grunts ) Still doing Taylor 's dirty work . What have you done with her ? ( grunts ) How 'd Leah sleep last night ? Oh , she was out cold for 14 hours . And she refused to take a shower . Apparently , she 's afraid of hot water . JOSH : Oh , nice . Maybe can we trade . Leah can stay with us and Maddy can move in with the Sixers . More hot showers for everyone . Sounds like a win-win to me . Good morning . I think yellow 's your color . Don 't like yellow . Itches . Okay . Breakfast ? What about the hair , Maddy ? Baby steps , Mom . She threw a brush at me . Oh . Jim , can you look after the girls today ? No . Gotta go see Taylor . A few things he wants to talk about . ( kiss ) Shouldn 't take long . But I 've got Maddy with me at the hospital all day . - Okay . Uh , Josh ? - Yeah ? Need you to babysit Leah and Zoe till I get back . Few hours tops . What am I supposed to do with them ? Think of something . Have fun ! So ... Okay , what do we have here ? Rajiv Swarup , 36-year-old male . Laceration to his right arm . They gave me something for the pain . It still hurts like a son of ... Let 's take a look . Okay ... How 'd this happen ? The autoplow jammed up . I tried to fix it . The next thing you know , my arm 's sausage . Ooh , Maddy , come take a look at this . Uh , that 's okay . I 'll just stand over here and observe ... from over here . Last little bit . It 's okay . So that 's probably right into the ... I sent Washington out at dawn to look for the girl 's bag . Thought maybe it 'd buy us some good will . That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Morning , Trace . Thank you . How soon is too soon to start a debriefing ? Today , tomorrow ? Might want to give her a little more time than that . - I 'll discuss it with Elisabeth . - All right . Sixers ! Sixers ! Sound the alarm ! To your posts ! They 've come for me . Hey , you 're safe here , Leah . No one gets through the gates unless Taylor says so . ( guns cocking ) ♪ ♪ They 've come for the girl . Whoever they got on the inside tipped them she 's here . Raise the gate . ( whirring , clanking ) ( creaking ) You got a spare one of those ? Thanks . So ? You have something that belongs to me . I want her back . Is that why you abducted my people ? Just returning the favor , Taylor . The girl came to us . I don 't believe you . I think your people took her . I think she 's being held as your prisoner . I think we both know that 's not true . You want your people back , give me the girl . This is not a negotiation . The girl will decide her own fate . If she wants to leave with you , she 's free to go . Then bring her out here and let 's find out . As soon as you release my people . Let them go . What ? I said ... let them go . Shannon , bring the girl out here . Dad came and got Leah . What ? Mira wants to talk to her . Okay , look after your sister . - But , Mom ! - Just do it , Maddy . Come on . Just tell the truth Leah . It 'll be okay . Leah , look at me . Tell them you want to come home . Speak ! I ran away . I 'm not going back with you . I want to stay here . TAYLOR : She 's made her decision . The girl stays . Keep her then . She 's nothing to me . This is the second time you 've come to my gates and threatened the colony . There won 't be a third . Next time I 'm going to war . I want a list of everybody who was outside the gates from the time she got here till 0900 this morning . Sometime in that 24-hour window , the spy must have got in contact with the Sixers . - Let 's find him . - Okay . You , hey , peanut , you did great out there . You weren 't even scared , were you ? No , I could see that you weren 't . Why you looked like you might even throw a punch or something . Thought I 'd have to hold you back . Hey , let 's see what you got , huh ? Come on . Let me have it . Whack him . Ow ! I knew it . That is a mean right hand you 've got there . Lethal . So keep practicing . When you turn 18 , I 'm might have to put you in uniform . I like uniforms . Look , I know you 've heard some pretty terrible things about me and I don 't know how life is out there with the Sixers , but , Leah , take a look around . People are happy here . They 're safe . Everybody 's got a home and nobody gets scraps . I don 't like scraps . We move all the time . I don 't like that either . - Where do you move to ? - Lots of places . Mira never lets us stay in the same place for very long . Mmm . You know how to read a map ? I like maps . My dad taught me how to read them . Before the slasher ate him . Yeah . I tell you what . Maybe after you get settled in , you and I can sit down , take a look at some of the places you 've stayed . Maybe you can show me where your camp is . Deal ? Ow ! ( chuckles ) All right , I 'm gonna leave you in good hands . I need that list . Come on . Hey ! Hello , there . Do you remember me ? 'Cause I remember you . Little Leah Marcos . Not so little anymore . You know , I never forget a name or a face , but somewhere along the line , I forgot my legs . So if you happen to see ' em walking around without me , could you tell ' em I 'm looking for ' em ? ( chuckles ) Hey welcome back to Terra Nova , Leah Marcos . Welcome back . GIRLS : Welcome ! JIM : To Leah Marcos . To coming home . Cheers . Really . ( chuckles ) Hey , maybe tomorrow we can put a comb through your hair , you think ? Don 't like combs . ( snickers ) Okay . You guys should have seen Maddy on her first day in the infirmary . She did a great job . Yeah , well , all I really did was reorganize your storage locker and told you a patient 's name . Well ... No , to my oldest daughter . the next doctor in the Shannon family . Hear , hear . Cheers . TAYLOR : So how 's the mole hunt going , Shannon ? Give me an update . Okay , there was a team outside the gates doing some perimeter mine repair from 0630 to about noon : Michelle Toomey and , uh , Nhat Trang ? No , I know ' em both . Good solid citizens . Nothing there . Okay , and Science Division had somebody out following up on a field study . They took the CSO 's rover ; Robert Stanley . Stanley ? Did he go out alone ? Yeah . Let 's talk to him . Why him ? He came in on the Sixth Pilgrimage , but he didn 't leave with Mira . Only about half of ' em did . We investigated those who stayed , but we couldn 't find any connection to the Sixers . Maybe we missed something with Stanley . But I thought we 'd been over this . And we 'll keep going over it till I say otherwise . I was completing my field study on wax moss . This ... I don 't care about your field study . Talk to me about the Sixers . I don 't know anything about the Sixers . Well , you made a radio transmission at 1100 hours yesterday . Who were you contacting ? The lab , to let them know I 'd be late . - TAYLOR : Uh-huh . - Hey , Commander . What brings you out here ? Somebody tipped the Sixers off about the girl . ( laughs ) And you think it was Rob ? You can 't be serious . I thought I 'd ask a few questions , yes . And do you have any actual evidence against him ? Enough to take him into custody ? You his lawyer now ? No . Funny enough , we don 't have any of those around here , do we ? Tread carefully , Malcolm . No , I don 't think I will . This is guilt by association . So what if he came over on the Sixth ? A lot of people did who have nothing to do with Mira . JIM : Like the commander said , we 're just asking a few questions . Relax . Yeah , and that 's what they said to my father at the Edinburgh Hearings of 2119 . " Just asking questions . " That 's how it starts , Jim . Get off your high horse , will you , Malcolm ? You 're right Rob ? When did you get up here ? Don 't be nervous . It 's just a small test to see what grade level you 'll do best in , and then , Monday , you can start school . Sounds fun , right ? Don 't worry . Jim will be by in a couple of hours to pick you up . Okay ? Thank you . Bye . Aw . She 's so cute . Remember your first day at school ? You couldn 't wait to get there . Yeah , I loved it . Not gonna lie . That 's my gal . I 'll , uh , catch up with you . Mr. Shannon . Hey . I ... I was hoping to talk to you about your daughter , Maddy . What about her ? Well , as you know , I 've begun the initial stages of courting Maddy , and I was wondering - if I could ... - Excuse me , Reynolds . You are aware that I carry a gun , have a quick temper and tend to hold grudges , right ? WASHINGTON : Shannon . We had a break-in at the McMillen place . Pod D-26 . Let 's move . So I 've been at work all day . Came home and found the place broken into . And then this . What was inside ? I don 't know . I didn 't even know there was a hole here . Could you , uh , give us a minute ? Yeah , sure . Thanks . We need to find out who lived here before the McMillens . See if they know anything about what was buried under the floor . - That 's going to be tough . - Why ? This used to be Mira 's old place . We need to find Leah right now . Hey . What 's going on here , kiddo ? What did you take from that couple 's house , Leah ? Leah ! Stop ! Stop ! It 's okay . It 's okay . Give me the bag . There 's nowhere to run . JIM : No doubt about it , Commander . Mira sent her to infiltrate Terra Nova . She 's been lying to us the whole time . It was theater , more or less . Mira played me . She knew I 'd let the kid in . Knew I 'd believe her story . Knew I wouldn 't send her away , especially if the Sixers made a show of trying to get her back . She 's the perfect spy . Young enough to be sympathetic , but old enough to be capable . First chance she got , she broke into that house and grabbed this ... container or whatever thing this is . Does it open ? Sealed shut , no visible seams . Sounds like it 's hollow . Ask her how to open it . She might not know . TAYLOR : Might not tell us even if she does know . Bring her in . ( sighs ) Have a seat , kiddo . Hey . I 'm not going to ask you why you did what you did , but the commander and I have a job to do , and we need you to answer a few questions . We need you to be honest . You understand ? TAYLOR : Young lady , look at me . You know what this is ? WASHINGTON : Is it a weapon ? Leah . No more lies now , okay ? What 's in there ? Why does Mira want it ? I don 't know . Mira didn 't say . She just told me to get it , so I did . Leah , why ? Why all the lies ? Because Mira 's got my brother . And she said she was going to hurt him if I didn 't steal back that box . I 'm telling the truth . Take her to Pod Zero . Please ! I have to bring that box back to Mira , or she 'll hurt my brother . She 'll hurt Sam . Please ! We 're going to detain her till we figure out exactly what 's going on here . Fascinating . Oh . Maddy . Maddy , come and take a look at this . That 's okay . I 'm good over here . Well , you can 't learn anything from over there . Come and look . It 's a vesiculopustular lesion . Very common in warm , humid climate ... No . Something on your mind ? What if she 's telling the truth about her brother ? I mean , we ... we should send a few people to check it out just in case . I 'm not going to expend colony resources on a hunch . Mira might have planned this , too . You 'd be walking right into an ambush . But if there 's a kid out there that 's being hurt ... " If . " If I had some proof , that would be one thing . I got the word of a little girl who managed to deceive me and every damn person in this colony . I know that , but , Commander ... The answer is no . That 's an order . Let it go . You got a wife , kids . Go home . You think Mira would really hurt her little brother ? There 's no way to know if she 's telling the truth about anything now . I 'm going to go for a walk . Not such a great day in the infirmary today . Aw . Did the overachiever just kind of sort of achieve ? Instead of open-heart surgery , she could only do an appendectomy ? - Josh . - Hmm ? Stop talking . At least I get my room back . Hey . Don 't beat yourself up . Leah let us down . You did everything right . I know . I just thought I was a better judge of character , you know ? Well , I thought I was , too . I don 't like people taking advantage of my family . JOSH : Mom , Dad . Look what Leah left . JIM : " I 'm sorry . I had to . " So she wasn 't lying about her brother . Which means he really is in danger . REYNOLDS : Maddy . - Hey . - Hey . Are you doing anything right now ? Yeah , I 'm just picking up a few things . Uh , I wanted to talk to you about something . Uh ... I , um ... Thank you . I want to declare my intentions for you , Maddy Shannon . You want to do what to me ? Uh ... To court you . Court ? You mean , like ... like , date ? Yes . ( laughs ) Why didn 't you just say that ? Uh , because that 's not how it 's done . According to the commander , I have to address you in a certain way , and then speak with your father , and then call at your house , and then have the honor of escorting you to a planned activity or event outside the home that might please you . People used to do it this way . Well , technically , they will do it that way . You know , in the future . But then again , they 'll also wear corsets . So ... may I have the honor ? Yes . Yes , you may . Awesome . - Yeah ? - Yeah . 'Cause I was just having the worst day ever . Well , tell me about it . Well , where should I start ? The part where I almost puked on a patient in front of my mother ? Or the part where Leah just , you know ... Start at the beginning . I have time . ( insects chirping ) ♪ ♪ Oh , crap .

Where am I ? Did Taylor send you ? ( panting ) I came for Leah 's brother . She said you were gonna hurt him . And you believed her ? She only lied when she had to . The boy was never in danger . I just needed to motivate her . To get her to do what I knew she could . What 's in the box that 's so important ? ( sighs ) ( groans ) Right up here in the canopy , huh ? No wonder Taylor can 't find you . I hear he 's taken quite a shine to you . Have to say , I 'm surprised , considering the way you snuck into his colony . You sure know a lot about what goes on inside of Terra Nova . Almost makes me think , uh- - ooh , I don 't know- - you got yourself a spy or something . Maybe I 'm psychic . Maybe . Maybe you should 've had your spy get the box for you instead of sending a little girl . Or did you not want to risk exposing whoever it is ? I can see why Taylor values you so much . Oh . Yeah . Well , that 's ' cause I-I got to save his life once . It was thanks to you , as a matter of fact . You know , in a way , I 'm glad you did . Carter would 've killed him , that would 've made a martyr of him . Which would only make my job harder . And what is your job ? Taylor 's pissed off some very powerful people back in 2149 . They want him gone . Gone ? If it wasn 't for Taylor , Terra Nova wouldn 't have lasted as long as it has . If the colony survives ... - Everybody knows that . - Oh , come on , Shannon , don 't tell me you believe in all that " starting over " crap ! That 's not what Terra Nova 's about . Not now , not ever . Then what 's Terra Nova really about ? You 'll see . But you don 't want to be on the wrong side of history , Shannon . Be smart . Do what 's right for your family . 'Cause sooner or later , we 're going to take Taylor down . Why ? What does it get you ? It gets me my family . I have a daughter back in 2149 . Sienna . She was four when I left . I do my job ... they make sure I get to see her again . Who 's they ? You 're free to go . Wait . DENNIS : Leah ! LEAH : Sam ! It 's gonna be okay . Gonna be okay . I ought to run you out of town for disobeying an order , Shannon . Yeah , but what the hell . You reunited a family . Terra Nova just officially grew by two . How 'd you make it out of there with the boy ? Uh , Mira let us go . Now , that doesn 't sound like Mira . Doesn 't sound like her at all . I think she was trying to prove something . Like maybe the Sixers aren 't so bad . Were you convinced ? I might 've been , if they hadn 't have busted up my ribs . She say anything I should know about ? Well , she 's not a fan of yours . I meant something I don 't already know . I sure as hell would like to know what 's in that box she sent the kid here to steal . No luck getting it open , huh ? Go get yourself bandaged up . Let your wife know you ain 't dead . Oh , if I had a Terra for every time I 've had to put you back together ... You 're making me sound like Humpty Dumpty .

Umm , 11 thru ' 18 in Economy , I don 't know about the rest , the curtains were closed . Okay . That 's good . So if anyone asked , just say a passenger is ill . Radio lights to be out throughout the night to Tokyo . Wouldn 't want to cause a panic . What do we do with the body ? We can relocate everyone comfortably downstairs in Economy and still provide you with upper class services and amenities . And as compensation , each passenger will receive two vouchers for upper pass round trip travel everywhere in the world . - What happened ? - I don 't know . The guy just flatlined .

Why this stupid seat bell ... ! Okay . Lets go . Lets get out of here . Hey . You were helping the dead guy , right ? - What happened to him ? - ( Sighs ) I don 't know . Was it contagious ? It might be . Hey . You know , um , about what you were saying before ? You know , " death is a part of life . " I agree with you . Yeah . Yeah . I mean the guy who died , probably thought he had all the time in the world . He sat on the plane , had no idea it was all going to end today . And maybe he wanted to write a book . Maybe he wanted to have kids . Sorry , too late . But if you remember that one day , you and I , all of us , we 'll all be dead . You won 't want to waste one second of whatever time you have left . Yeah . I wish I could live like that . Why can 't you ? Peope get all tied up in what they think they should do . When you die , you die .

( child laughs ) We could try again . I couldn 't , not a third time . What if it happens again ? When I was younger , all I wanted to do is be a mom . I never talked about a job and career . 'Cause you wanted to be happy while your friends think you 're cool and ambitious . But ... in my heart , my real dream , I just wanted a home with you and our children running around . Yeah , so did I. I was just ... helpless , the first time . Do you want a blanket ? - I 'm just going to stretch my legs . - Yeah . Liz : Honey , look ... ( creepy face with clawing hands ) What ?

No , first time . - It 's so sad . - Yeah , it 's crazy . Suzy : Hey you know that guy in row 13 , the one that 's always playing video games ? Yeah . 13F . He hasn 't been in his seat in a while .

Sir , you need to go back to your seat . Laura : The body 's gone . We have to go . ( noise of upper storage door opens ) Remember that trip we took to Cabo ? When we , uh , had a huge fight in the hotel room and didn 't speak for what ? Four days ? - Mm-hm . - Yeah , I remember . Why are you bringing up the worst time we ever had ? Because I keep thinking about how much time we wasted . The weather was great , the hotel was beautiful . I just ... we were the disaster . Yeah . I don 't want to waste anymore time . What do you mean " the body is gone " ? I think this kid moved it as a prank . Captain : Oh , better find it or else we all will be grounded . Look , it gotta be on board . Just do a sweep row by row . - We 're gonna do a sweep , row by row , okay ? - Okay . - Yeah . - Hey , Pete , um , Can I ask you something ? Did you happen to see a ... a jet flying near us ? A , a F-16 ? Captain : An F-16 ? No . Laura : I 'll investigate and report back . Thank you , Captain . It 'll be fine , gonna be fine ... Please . Please . Please . Thank God . ( screams ) Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ... ! Excuse me . I 'm so sorry . Just one second . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Excuse me . - Sure , I uh ... Alright . There you go . Hey , I just overheard the flight attendant ... the dead body is missing . - What ? - How could it be missing ? I don 't know . The passenger 's missing too . I saw him go upstairs , never came back , and ... Okay. this is going to sound weird , but I saw something on my monitor . - It kinda look like that dead guy . - Come on ! Holy scrap ! I saw him too . Why won 't you tell me that ? This is not the time for us to talk about our communication issue . - There 's a dead body missing , focus ! - Yeah , I know . Hey , guys . We need to find out who the hell that dead guy is . 'Cause whatever 's going on , it 's because of him . Yeah . Hey , check his carry-on . I don 't understand . He 's gone . You know what I always wonder ? What do people think about just before they die ? You know who I 'll be thinking about ? My first boyfriend , Sean Osborne . He kissed me and my knees literally go weak . I had to ... hold on him just so I won 't fall . Always hoped I would find that ? ... and I never quite got there . - I 'm sorry . - Yeah ? Yeah . So ... - any luck with the body ? - No . Peter . I know you 're not gonna leave your wife . - What ? - It ... it 's okay , you know . You 've kids together . I wish it was different . It 's all timing . Laptop . An ID . Here we go . Dead guy 's name , Lance Morrell from Corona , California . This is hair ? Has names on it , Tracy , Anne , Katy . - Oh my God . They 're his victims . - We don 't know that . This product is known in the State of California to cause cancer . - This is what he 's using to kill them . - With cancer ? Really ? Worked like a weapon ? My mom always said that my dad gave her cancer . - Laptop 's locked . - Uh ... Will you try his birthday ? 41572 . No ? I don 't know . Jacinta : You 're stealing that dead guy 's stuff ? Have fun ! Try to keep them together . Brad : Works like a purse , you know ? What 's this ? Laura : What are you doing ? Rick : It 's not what you think . This is , uh , Lance Morrell 's stuff . The passenger who died . You 've no right to be going through someone else 's property . Yeah ? Well something happened on this plane and it all started when he died . Brad : Look , we know the body is missing , and the passenger . - And you saw something , too ? - I didn 't see anything . Through the window , I heard you . We need to get into his checked luggage . His checked luggage in the cargo hold ? Yeah , there might be something in there that will tell us what 's going on . - You can get in there . - Enough ! - Now go back to your seats . - Yes , ma 'am . - Okay . Probably you want me to come with you ? Nope , I want you at the hatch . ( box lid creaking ) ( doll squeaking ) Brad : What is that ? Rick : It says it 's a shinigami . - It 's a death doll . Rick : Looks like Lance was delivering to a client in Tokyo . Cool . In Japanese mythology , shinigami is a death spirit . When you 're ripped from your life too quickly , you have to let go of whatever that 's holding you here , so you can move on . Once you 've done that , the real shinigami will take your soul to the afterlife . Why would someone bring that on a plane ? I don 't know but I can tell you one thing . This Lance guy 's holding on , he 's not letting go . ( Doll continues to squeaks ) ( metal screeching noise ) ( thud ) ( distorted voices ) ( dog barks , Laura screams ) Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! ( luggage of Lance Morrell ) ( Laura screams ) I 'm sorry , Meg . ( distorted voice over radio ) ( distorted voice continues ) Radio Tokyo . Come in . This is Vista Pacific Flight 7500 Heavy . ( distorted and intermittent voice over radio ) ( distorted voice continues ) Captain : No ! No ! ( Suzy screams ) Did you hear that ? I don 't want that on the plane . How should we do that ? Open up a window ? ( ghostly voice ) ( Suzy screams ) Brad : Hey , you okay ? Aah ! What the fuck was that ? Alright , alright , stay calm , stay calm . We 're going to be okay . Come with us . Rick : Liz . ( alarm buzzing ) ( Jacinta 's voice on speaker ) Death is a part of life . No idea it was all gonna end today . You wouldn 't want to waste one second of whatever time you 've left , if you remember ... that one day , you and I , all of us ... will be dead . Not here ! God ! Rick : Oh God ! I don 't understand . Rick : What ? What ? Hey , hey . Come on . Come on . Look at me . Look at me . Look at me . What was back there ? What was back there ? ( Brad gasping ) Jacinta : When you 're ripped from your life too quickly , You have to let go of whatever is keeping you here . Before you can move on . ( cries out ) This evening the Pacific Flight 7500 from Los Angeles to Tokyo alerted traffic controllers . They were encountering rough turbulence unexpectedly And soon after that , all communication with the plane ceased . We alluded to the turbulence must have loosened a critical seal and that seal gave way short time later creating a rapid decompression of air the plane . At this point in time , we believe the oxygen masks malfunctioned and in a de-pressurized environment , the lack of oxygen would be fatal . Gosh ! Breathe , come on , breathe . On the TV : All communication attempts from that point on have not been successful . Laura : Did you happen to see a jet , an F-16 ? On the TV : The F-16 decided to take a closer look at the plane but no sign of life could be seen . Reporter : Excuse me , excuse me , sir . Is there any chance of survival for those on board ? Spokesperson : At this point in time , we believe the chances of survival are slim . Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those on board . The plane has been flying on autopilot for the last 5 hours . It 's expected to run out of fuel and crash into the Pacific . We 'll continue to give information as it 's made available to us . Pia : Don 't let me go . Brad : I won 't . ( distorted voices ) ( distorted voices continue ) ( heavy breathing ) ( motor whirring ) Waste No Cigarette ( Liz screams )

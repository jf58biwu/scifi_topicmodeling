 The last fragment of a once living planet . Its body blasted into dust by the madness of its own inhabitants , while its head was cursed to roam aimlessly through time and space , screaming in pain and sorrow . In legend and in fact , it is known as Metal Hurlant . The sheriff ? Yeah , you 'll find him over there . Thank you kindly . So you had a look around . This is the town of Totem for you . Not much to look at . But we kinda prefer it that way . Wanna drink ? Things got quieter these days . Much quieter . But since you 're here , I guess you 've heard the stories . And of course about the doctor . This was a long time ago . Doc ! What happened ? The hell you think happened in our town ? He got shot , and I need him . Maybe the Murphys . Hold his head and fill him with whiskey . Well , the doctor was something like the opposite of what a man would call an expert . Whiskey was never enough to save ' em on his own . It 's gonna be a long night . Oh , God . Hey , bite this . This is gonna hurt . Not again . Well , doc , maybe one day you 'll save me a witness . I should have gone easy on him at the time . It would have helped ease things for later . I think you need to be alone , thinking about your inadequate skills . Well , those , um , skills were soon to become a major problem . How could I kill him ? I 've sworn an oath ! I swore to save them all ! 3 : 00 o 'clock in the morning . How can I be so drunk on my own ? I can 't save anybody . I 'm a ... I 'm a ... I 'm a two-bit apothecary . These hands belong to a shill in a medicine show . The Hell ? Aah ! My hands ! Oh , god ! My hands ! Oh , god ! From this night on , nothing would ever be the same . Down this side , don 't get a wild reputation unless it earns it . Men shooting Heaven and Hell out of each other . It was a long time ago . Back then , we had doctor 's surgery with hardly any medical equipment . To speak of . Hell , we had whisky . As disinfectant for the wounds ... Yep , yep , I know . I know . Here you go . Here you go . As something to dull the pain . That ... And a doctor with a healing touch . Vibrations from Doc Rowan 's fingers moved bullets away from vital organs , making them much easier to remove . Bullet was lodged dangerously close to the artery , my friend . Or so he claimed . You 'll live now . Thing was , the proof was there for all to see . An overcrowded one , at that . It 'd be another month before the man from the city came collecting for prisoners . In the midst of a man ... Playing a god . It was as if a hand had been under the blood and guts and sinew of the town ... And exposed everything in there . All the tensions within Totem suddenly ... unleashed . With long standing squabbles coming to the surface . And nothing holding ' em back . At least not the fear of death . You guys are lucky . Few months ago , you would have been dead meat . But by God ... I can do more than just patch you up . You know , being patient is one important quality if you don 't want your doc to mess up . Well , it 's a sure bet you won 't be winning any beauty pageants soon , but in some sort of odd way , this might improve your life . Help me , doc . No , I 'm not forgetting about you . Please . Be a good patient . The wounds a man should rightly die of ... Rowan , using his gift as good as his word , he did more than save and patch ' em up . As good as sending ' em out to do it again . I was overrun . Faced with the prospect of arresting the whole town . Word was spreading ' . Say a feud to settle , or looking for a wild time . You come to Totem . Sure of the knowledge the wounded have a much higher chance of surviving ... So came the Murphy gang . Sheriff Jones , looks like we 've got some visitors ... You 're telling me . It 's the Murphys . They 've been a pain in the backside for so long . They feel invincible . as if that tattoo on their arm helps them to cheat death . Tattoo ? Yeah . Every member of the gang gets one on their left forearm . Supposed to bring ' em luck . I 'll say ... Done right up till now . Well , I 'm not sure they 're lucky as I am . Keep an eye on them , Ben . But watch yourself . I don 't want you involved with them in any gambling games , you hear me ? One time in your damn life , you just stay out of trouble . Yeah . You have my word . Come on , come on , boys . You and I , we should go upstairs . Well , I guess ... This is my lucky day . Man , I 'm sure my missus will know how to thank me , guys . This is gonna be Ben 's day . Or not . Nobody move . A gang of cutthroat thieves she could ever hope to meet . The Murphys . By this time , my options were fewer by the minute . Okay , let 's play again . Town had gone to Hell . And I know who was to blame . Doc , a word ? Can 't you see I 'm busy , sheriff ? I said a word . All right . We can use the side room . It ends here . You leave this town now . You know , when I came to Totem , I had nothing . No equipment . Whiskey 's all I had . Some call it the water of life . But then ... That light hit me . My hands . Are you blind , sheriff ? Something miraculous is happening . And , uh , life is precious . And Totem is my calling . You may recollect , doc , I put a gun to your head . That kind of bullet so aimed would put even one of your miracles to the test . What 'll it take , doc ? How much you prepared to lose ? What the- - ? Which one of you Murphy bastards is killing my townfolk ? Thank you . Too much anger . Hands shaking . Never had a chance . The taste of blood , whiskey in my mouth . Guts hanging in the wind . Bullets are wedged deep , sheriff . Tore a hole right through your stomach . Normally , be too difficult to remove . Normally , you 'd bleed to death . But you 're in my hands now . Murphys . Yeah , it 's not your problem anymore . Soon , you 'll be better . And I 'm sure you 'll find the wisdom to deal with them . Deal . What deal ? I stared into his eyes . I knew he had a hold over me . He saved my life . He 'll never leave Totem . I had to do what anyone with an ounce of sense would do to save this town . Murphys soon tired of the place and left . But not before Doc helped them on their way . Using his skill in the wounded , his miraculous healing touch . That was the deal , apparently . Of course , they left . But not without a sting in the tail . Not before burning most of Totem to the ground . But the town people , they stayed . They built the place back up again . So ... I guess you wanna settle in ? You 're not the first one who comes to town with hopes of being the new doc . Truth is , we don 't need a doc here anymore . Like I said , things are quieter now . You know , most of the docs usually excuse themselves right now . And thank me for my time . But something tells me you 're not planning on doing that . You got that right , sheriff . Now , where do I sign up ? Bad call . Totem used to be known for its doctor . But now it 's quieter . Now people say , " here 's the place the sherriff can 't be beat by death no more . " Oh , and the whiskey ? Found another use .

 BARBIE : A few weeks ago , an invisible dome crashed down on Chester 's Mill , cutting us off from the rest of the world . Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead , we still don 't know . Every day it tests our limits , bringing out the best and the worst in us . Some say we 'll be stuck here forever , but we will never stop fighting to find a way out . REBECCA : Big Jim threw the egg off the cliff , I 'd say that proves it 's the dome 's power source . The dome 's contracting . You mean , it 's shrinking ? REBECCA : I figured out that at its present rate , it won 't be long before the dome . - Crushes us completely ? - All of this is your fault . - Where 's Melanie ? - I painted a vision ... it may show us how to save her . - ( screams ) - Melanie ! Melanie ! - Grab my hand ! Grab my hand ! - In my dream , I saw Melanie disappear , - but I didn 't know it meant that . - I love you . You know why ? 'Cause she 's supposed to be with me , Jim . We have to go after Melanie . It 's too dangerous . No one 's going anywhere . - Can you see anything ? - No . Oh , my God ! There 's another earthquake . Where do you think the crater leads ? JOE : Maybe it 's another tunnel , like at the school . - It could lead to Zenith . - Yeah , or somewhere else . Anywhere but here would be great . We 've got to check it out . But we 've got to do it right ... not risking anyone else 's life . BIG JIM : Help me ! Help ! - Pauline , Pauline ! - Lay her down on her side , gently . Hunter , I need your shirt . - What happened ? - Lyle . Lyle stabbed her . - Where is he now ? - He 's dead . Here . I tried to stop the bleeding . - All our medical supplies are at the school . - Well , let 's get there now . The Prius is at the edge of the woods . Let 's go ! PAULINE : Julia . I 'm right here . After I was stabbed , I had a vision . The dome chose you . But ... you 're not alone ... there 's someone else , but I can 't see his face . He ... he doesn 't know he 's the one . Come on , get a stretcher ! Let 's get this underneath her . Got to keep pressure on this wound . - Rebecca , you 're coming with us . - Okay , okay . - BARBIE : * * * - BIG JIM : Yeah . Yeah . Ready ? You 're gonna be okay . - Come on . - One , two , three ... up ! REBECCA : Keep breathing . What 's happening ? JOE : The walls are getting closer . The dome 's a sphere , it 's contracting horizontally - and vertically ... - I think it 's shutting down . Everything inside 's going haywire . Yeah , we 've got to get some gear , so we can explore this crater . MAN : Help ! We need help ! It 's near the Tilden farm . I thought we got everybody in the middle of town . Tom must have gone back for something . Hey , keep an eye on Hunter . Don 't do anything stupid . - Wait , where are you going ? - JOE : We need to get a tablet . - What for ? - When this thing opened , it might have created a new crack in the dome , which means we may be able to get a Wi-Fi signal . Maybe we can get a message to the Hounds of Diana . If the Hounds tell us that Melanie 's in Zenith , that means the crater 's our way out . ( booming ) Help ! - ( groaning ) - Help ! - BARBIE : What happened ? - The shaking ! It fell ! - It 's crushing my leg ! - Help my dad ! - Get him , get my son out of here . - Please ... ( screaming in pain ) - No , I need to help ! - Go with Julia , son . - You 're coming with us ! - Tom , I 'll look after him . Get him out of ... ( screams ) ( screams ) Let 's try this . - Buddy , go with Julia . - I 'm not leaving without you , Dad . - We 're gonna help him , all right ? - I 'll try again . ( screams ) Go ! Get out ! Go ! Get out ! ( electrical crackling ) - No , Dad , no ! - Go , go ! - No , Dad ! Dad , no ! No ! - I think Joe 's right , - that the dome 's shutting down . - ( screaming ) I 'm guessing we 've got a few more hours . - No ! Dad , no ! ( screaming ) - Come on , buddy . - ( hysterical screaming ) Dad ! - I know , buddy . - Let 's go , come on , guys . - ( indistinct shouting ) - SAM : Get as much gauze as you can find . - Put over here ! Put over here ! Her abdomen 's rigid ... she 's bleeding internally . Lyle might have lacerated an organ . Kidney , maybe , or her liver . Sam , I know you can help . Do something , all right ? She 's gonna need surgery to stop the bleeding . - Well , then , operate . Do whatever ... - I 'm not a surgeon ! And we don 't have anesthesia or equipment . I can 't even tell which organ is injured without an MRI . - Listen , there is an answer ... - Find it ! - Please , you have to help her . - I 'm doing everything I can . 02x13 - Go Now Downloaded from G2G.fm No signal . I 'm sorry . It was a good idea , though . So , the crater didn 't create a crack in the dome , and there 's no new tunnel . Maybe it did , but somebody 's blocking the signal . Yeah , or maybe it 's just a giant , killer suckhole . We 're literally hours from being crushed to death . Maybe I should just go find my mom , and spend my last few hours with her , instead of trying to convince myself that whoever or whatever controls this dumb dome ... even gives a crap about any of us . Norrie , I need you here with me , okay ? - Hey . Hey , wh-what are you doing ? - Plan B. Joe , you 're not going down there . This is my town ... yours , too , now . If we don 't do anything , we all die . If we explore the crater , then we might be able to find a way to save everyone . He 's right . We know the dome better than anyone . You 're okay , Pauline . What happened ? Lyle tried to take you away from me . He stabbed you . But he 's dead now . Everything 's gonna be okay , I promise . Can we give her something for the pain ? We 've got morphine . Just ten milligrams , okay ? Jim . Yeah . We should talk . Okay , I 'll be right back . She looks good ... on the mend . The internal damage is too massive to control without surgery . So , do something else . I can keep her as comfortable as possible , but there is nothing I can do to stop her from bleeding out . What are you saying , that she 's gonna die ? If there was something else ... anything , I would do it . BIG JIM : I don 't accept that . Pauline came back to save us , not bleed out in front of her son . The dome won 't let her die . This is just another test . My family , my wife ... we were chosen . We 've got to get Mom back to the crater . Melanie didn 't just disappear into thin air . It must lead somewhere . I hope it does , Junior , but Pauline 's injuries are too severe . If we move her , it will accelerate the bleeding . Well , tell me what we can do . - She needs fluids . - Where do I get saline ? - The clinic ? - I 'll find it . It is another tunnel . But it 's different than the one underneath the school What are those things ? I don 't know , but they 're cool . Yeah , and kind of terrifying . All right , let 's do this . I hope we can find Melanie down here . NORRIE : Careful . Come on . You okay , Mom ? Just a little pain . Can we give her ... some more morphine ? We don 't want to give her an overdose . Oh , Junior , it 's okay . Dad 's coming back . Okay ? And we 're gonna fix you up ... just like Melanie . Do you think she 's okay ? That she made it out ? Anything 's possible . ( moans ) My brushes and canvas . What do you mean ? Maybe I can paint the way out . Junior , it 's important . Now go get them . James . We 've been through so much . I got to see my sweet , sweet boy become a man . I love you , Mom . I love you ... forever . ( quietly ) : Forever . ( panting ) What you said to Junior ... it sounded like a good-bye . We both know the truth . - I 'm not going to make it . - We just have to get you stable . If the crater 's a way out , we 'll take you . No . The dome 's done with me . I saw my own death . Pauline . All that matters is Junior . That he survives . ( sighs ) And Jim won 't let me go . I don 't want that . What are you saying ? Let me go peacefully . Becky , help me . Please . I think you were supposed to be here for this . I don 't know about that . I 've still got to go grab that gear , get back to the crater , figure out what 's down there . We should split up . I 'll take Aidan back to the high school , while you head back . Well , wait for me at the school . All right ? Grab a walkie from Sam . I 'll be in touch . All right , honey , we 're gonna head this way , okay ? What do we do about this fork ? Which way ? I have no idea . Joe , look . I think we just made our decision . How long do you think the crater 's gonna stay open ? I-I don 't know . Not long . We 've got to tell Barbie there might be a way out . Hey ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ? - We went down . - Yeah , I-I see that . What part of " Don 't do anything stupid " did you not understand ? Don 't be * * * . We couldn 't wait . We found more tunnels . There was a Monarch down there , too . It-it showed us a path ... with a light at the end . Did you see where it goes ? We had to get out , things are shaky down there . The passage may not be open for long . But it goes somewhere . And , like I said before , anywhere 's better than here . It doesn 't look like your dad 's showing up with the egg anytime soon . The time between its contractions is getting shorter . And the dome 's making the weather worse . All right , well , we 're going down the crater . It 's our only shot . Julia ! I think we got another chance . This might be the way out of here . Thanks . Sam . Rebecca . The crater could be the way out . We 've got to gather the town . Okay , well , most everyone 's either here , at the Sweet Briar , - or the church . - All right , well , round them up . - We 've got to get everybody to the woods . - How ? Uh ... school buses . They run on diesel . There 's a whole fleet . Got to be fuel left in some of them . I 'll check it out . Round up the wounded ... we 'll get them on first . All right , anyone who can 't fit on the buses will just walk . Jim , what are you doing here ? I 'm looking for saline , someone 's hurt . W-Well , didn 't you hear the plan ? We 're leaving . Everyone . - Did you find any saline ? - No , leave it . We have to round everyone up . Julia said there isn 't much time . Listen , if I don 't find that saline , my wife dies ! I knew it ! Like it was waiting for me ! Hey . Your mom 's here . Julia wants our help loading up the buses . What 's wrong ? Do you really think we 're gonna get out ? I mean , the tunnels are freaky , but , yeah , we 'll make it . It 's not the tunnels . It 's what 's after that . Am I just supposed to go back to my life in California ? Without my mom ? How can I go and just leave her here ? Hey , she 's not here . Neither is Angie . They might be buried in Chester 's Mill , but they 'll always be with us . Do you know why I was going to boot camp ? Why I 'm here in the first place ? I assumed you got into some kind of trouble . ( laughs gently ) I punched some stupid girl in the mouth and knocked her tooth out . And all she did was make fun of my hair . It 's just so ... stupid to think how much I cared . - If I had just ignored her ... - No , the dome wanted you here . It would have found another way . I don 't care what the dome wanted . Because I just want my mom . Sometimes I think , on Dome Day , if Angie and I just went to brunch with my mom ... But then I never would have met you . My mom told me before she died to be brave . And I just don 't feel brave right now . Look , I don 't know what 's gonna happen , but , whatever 's out there , we 're gonna face it together . Okay . No . No . Pauline , there 's news . The passage you opened ... we 're evacuating everyone through it . So , if-if you can just hold on , we can try and get you to a doctor . ( moans ) I won 't make it . I 'll only slow down the people I love . It 's just a little longer . You can do it . No , this is what the dome wants . I paid for my sins . ( sighs ) For once , I 'll be able to sleep without dreaming . No , there 's hope now . We 're only getting out because of you . Good . Junior will be safe . Aah . This is so much pain . Please ... be kind . Please . Ah , sweet girl . Sweet girl . Can you help me and make sure everyone has a seat ? - Yeah , okay . - Thanks , Aidan . Rain . If it wasn 't enough of a mess already . The dome 's contractions must be messing with the weather patterns ... or something . NORRIE : No ! Come with me now . I told you a hundred times , I need to stay here . I 'm one of the four hands , mom . - I have to help . - I 'm not asking you , Eleanor . Hey , hey , hey . Norrie , do me a favor , okay ? Get on this first bus , I 'm really gonna need your help once we get to that crater . Okay . Thank you . Okay , come on . Julia ! Have you seen Andrea ? She 's getting supplies . She 's gonna meet us at the crater . ( thunder crashes ) All right , don 't stop . Let 's go ! Keep moving . Load up ! Keep moving . - Hey , where 's Pauline ? - She 's still inside . We 're waiting for Jim to get back from the clinic . Well , he 'd better hurry with that saline . How is your sister ? BIG JIM : Let me through ! I got the saline . Got it , come on . - We 've got to hurry . - Let 's go . Do what you can for Pauline , and then let 's go . I 'll see you soon . Baby , I got it for ya . I found the stuff you need . I told you the dome was looking after us . - ( mumbles ) - Pauline , I 'm back , honey . Jim , my pain is gone . That 's good . That 's good , that 's real good . I told you it 's gonna be okay . I know you love me . I 'm sorry . You don 't need to be sorry . ( whispering ) : You don 't need to be sorry . Pauline ? Look at me . What 's wrong ? Her pulse is dropping . ( sighs ) Take care of Junior . Pauline ... I love you all ... I just got you back . You did this . She said it was what the dome wanted . She begged me . You always have the solutions , don 't you ? It was a kind thing to do . I 'm sorry . Always got something in your ... in your back pocket for every emergency . It was her last request . Oh , now you can kill ? When it 's my wife ? Jim , if Pauline thought ... that this is what the dome wanted ... The dome wanted my family together . And you got in the way . Walk away , Jim . Go find Junior , and get him out of here . I 'll miss my wife forever . No one 's gonna miss you . ( screams ) Mom ? Mom ! Mom ! Oh , my God . ( moaning ) Sam . - ( groans ) - You ok ? Get up . What happened ? Oh , no . No ! Where 's Mom ? She 's gone . - What do you mean ? - Pauline asked Rebecca to help her ... end her life . She was in so much pain . Jim went after Rebecca . I tried to stop him , I couldn 't . I 'm so sorry , Junior . Mom was starting to say good-bye . I should have known . We 've got to find your dad ... he 's gone crazy . - We 've got to talk him down . - Why would I do that ? There 's no talking to him , there 's only dealing with him . Why 'd you paint that , Pauline ? I wish you hadn 't . Dome ... I 'll make you a deal . If you bring her back right now ... I won 't murder every single one of your special little friends . I won 't slit Julia 's throat , shoot Barbie in the heart , or burn those kids alive . Okay ? You got three seconds . Okay then . I 'm gonna free you from all this . So you can go right through that dome wall . And it 's gonna regret what it did to us . I promise . This is the same plan that we had before . We 're all gonna break up into small groups , keeping your family with you . We will call you forward one-by-one and get you down . Once your entire group is down , Joe and Norrie , here , will guide you into ... How do you know this is safe ? I know because I 've done it before . And , look , I know you 're all scared . Okay ? I-I-I know that I 'm a stranger . But for the last two weeks , we have fought together for the survival of this town . But , right now , I need you to trust me . 'Cause we don 't have another choice . If we stay here , we die . Now , come on ! Let 's get out of here ! ( speaking low , indistinctly ) Carolyn , listen ... I need you to go down with me , okay ? Help me keep everyone calm . Julia , Hunter . Hey , can I get you guys to stay at the top here ? All right ? Keep everything orderly . Make sure we don 't leave anyone behind . Am I forgetting anything ? No . You 're doing exactly what you 're supposed to . I love you . I love you , too . All right , you guys ready ? Let 's do it . All right , everybody ... group one , stick with me . Just stay calm , all right ? We 're gonna be fine . Let 's go . Hold on , hold on . It 's okay , guys ... we 've been here before . There 's no need to be afraid . Careful . All right , Carolyn . ( rumbling ) Watch out ! Crack 's getting wider . - You okay ? - Yeah . All right . Everybody watch your step , all right ? We 'll help you cross . Okay , how are we doing ? Most folks are accounted for . ANDREA : Julia , please be there . Andrea ? What 's wrong ? Where are you ? I 'm at my house . I need help , I ... Oh , God ! Andrea ? Andrea ! Andrea . Andrea ? Andrea ? ( weakly ) : In here . I knew you 'd come running . Put the bat down . SAM : Julia , come in . - ( whispering ) : Less is more . - Julia ? Hey , Sam . What do you need ? You okay ? Yeah , I 'm just helping Andrea . We 're headed back now . Junior and I are at the crater with Hunter . Listen , you should know , um ... Pauline is dead . And Jim killed Rebecca . He 's out there somewhere . Got to go now , Sam . What are you doing , Jim ? Payback . ANDREA : Against me ? What did I ever do , except be your neighbor and friend ? It 's not about you , honey . Sam forgot to mention that Rebecca murdered Pauline . Yeah . I gave the dome a chance to return her to me , but it declined . Which is bad for you . Killing me ... won 't bring Pauline back . Yeah , but it might ruin some of the dome 's plans . And that 's good enough . Andrea was your friend . Yeah , I know . That 's why I killed her quick . You don 't get that privilege . ( shouts ) Do you know why the dome didn 't bring Pauline back ? Because you 're a joke . 'Cause the dome doesn 't make deals with insects like you . Even your wife knew you were meaningless . I 'm gonna like you a lot better with your mouth broken . ( screams ) All right , everybody . Come on . Keep moving forward . Keep moving forward , you 'll catch up with the next group . All right ? Let 's go . Everything 's gonna be fine . All right , Julia ... how many we got left ? Uh , only a few ... I 'm sending them down now . Where 's Julia ? She left to help a friend . Where is she right now ? I don 't know ... she 's not answering her walkie . - ( gunshot ) - ( screams ) JUNIOR : Julia ! Here ! Are you okay ? Jim killed Andrea , he 's behind me . - Junior . - Go without me . - No , no . I 'm not gonna let you go alone . - I said ... go ! Put your arm around me . What are you doing , son ? I 'm not your son anymore . I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else . How you gonna do that ? You 're not leaving this town . You don 't tell me what to do . Not you . Not the dome . This is my town , little boy . ( gunshot ) Enjoy what 's left of it . ( grunts ) Oh , God . You made it . What happened ? - Jim . - Where is he ? Barbie , there 's no time . Junior 's taking care of it . Jim 's not getting down here . All right . I 'll take her . Let 's go . Can you take Aidan up ahead ? You just go on , all right ? I 'll be right behind you . - Okay . - Come on . Hunter , go up front with Joe and Norrie . Tell them to move out . - All right ? - Okay . We 'll catch up . Nice and slow . Junior ! ( Julia grunting ) All right . You 're gonna have to jump . Think you can do it ? Yeah , I can make it . I 'll get across and I 'll give you a hand . All right . Come on . - Step up , give me your hand . - Okay . ( rumbling ) ( coughs ) I can 't make it . No , there 's got to be another way . I 'm not leaving you here . You don 't have a choice . The town needs your help , and fast ... before the tunnels cave in on them . The dome chose you . Barbie , listen to me . Pauline had a vision of someone guiding everyone out of the dome . She didn 't see his face , but it 's you . But everything we 've done for this town , we 've done together . It 's okay . The dome has gotten us this far . I have faith ... that if you do what it 's asking ... it will protect me . ( rumbling ) I 'm coming back for you . I know . Junior ! Junior , you can 't leave me ! Junior ! Barbie , where 's Julia ? She 's coming . She sent me up ahead . Why 's everybody stopped ? Nobody knows which way to go . NORRIE : Barbie , we need to go this way . We saw the butterfly go down there . I think it 's a sign . Both Joe and I do . All right , this is the way . Okay ? Everybody follow me . What happened ? Barbie went ahead , he 'll come back for us . Then we 'll figure out a way across . No , this can 't be all that 's there . - It can 't be . - Is this a cave in ? Barbie , what do we do now ? I don 't ... I don 't know . We didn 't come all this way for a dead end . Screw you ! Can you hear me ? ! Whoever you are controlling all of this , can you just talk to us and tell us what 's going on ? ! How did you ... ? I have no idea . ( debris crumbling ) What 's that noise ? ( crackling ) Melanie ? Follow me . We 're going home . For more new Episodes go to G2G.fm

 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... You 're the Clairvoyant ? He let his emotions get the best of him . And he wasn 't gonna stop , Skye . I wasn 't gonna let that happen . I 'm worried he killed the wrong man . The Clairvoyant doesn 't have abilities . He has security clearance . He 's an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Why would may have an unauthorized encrypted hard line in the cockpit ? Put it down , May ! Who do you answer to ? ! Who 's the real Clairvoyant ? ! - Where are we going ? - I don 't know ! I didn 't do it ! When that plane touches down , take out everyone on board . Except Agent Coulson . He 's mine .

Echo-3 . I got a pair of UAVs on my six . These friendlies ? Over . They 're gonna hit my jet wash , they get any closer . What is that ? Drop the weapon . - Coulson ... - Drop the damn weapon and kick it over to the stairs , May , now ! Now ! Now back the hell up ! Over there ! Talk . Tell us where you rerouted the plane . - I didn 't set this new course . I swear ! - Don 't lie to me ! Yeah , well , the plane just turned around , for god 's sake ! How is this happening , then ? H.Q. can override automated control of the avionics , take us anywhere they want . Let me check the instrument panel , and I 'll be able ... - No way ! - You 're not going anywhere till you explain what ... It 's not me ! Why did you have an encrypted hard line ? And try to shoot me when we found it ? Let 's take a breath , huh ? Let 's not ! It was a dedicated channel ... to Director Fury . - That 's the truth . - Director Fury ? I haven 't been able to get him on the line for weeks . - You were reporting to him ? - That 's all I can tell you . Oh , just come out with it ! - That 's all you can tell us ? ! - I 'm under orders ! Fury will tell you . What ... was this an order ? To shoot me in the bloody head ? Hold on . We 're not headed to Fury anymore . I don 't know where we 're headed . And I can 't get Fury on the line because Fitz cut the line ! - Skye told me to ! - Someone was talking to the Clairvoyant , - The real Clairvoyant . - You were in the walls , Fitz . You want to explain why you were tampering with the plane 's sat cable ? Sure , because that 's relevant ! Don 't try and turn this around on me ! Fitz . I was trying to speak to Simmons at the Hub . And you needed an encrypted line ? - What 's so secret that you ... - Well , you tell me ! Simmons and I know you two have been whispering , keeping things from us , about the drug that saved your life . Simmons is just trying to figure out how the whole thing works ! Fitz . Who is she talking to ? Fitz , open the door . No way ... Not until we sort this out . - I 'm not opening anything . - Open the door . We can 't get anything sorted until you open the damn door ! Skye , get your laptop hooked up to our systems . See if you can pull up any S.H.I.E.L.D. communications . I want to know where this plane is headed and why . - Coulson ... - You stay put ! Now tell me who Simmons is talking to . 'Cause if it isn 't someone we trust , she 's in serious danger . Agent Simmons . I was wondering where you snuck off to . - You busy ? - Yes , but that 's okay . It 's noisy here today . A lot of guys in action mode . I asked around . Guess it 's a level eight operation of some sort . - Mm . - I was surprised to have this room to myself . So , what are you working on ? Wow . Coulson 's team is awfully secretive , even for this organization . Are you hiding something , agent ? - No . It 's just nothing important . - I hope not . Because I remember us tracking down a drug that brought a girl back from the brink , and that was real important . - Yes . I know . - Come to think of it , I don 't remember seeing it in the dispatches , or you mentioning it when Agent Blake got his ribs caved in . - I wasn 't in a positi ... - ' Cause if you had the means and you didn 't use them , that blood is all over your hands , too . I know . I 'm trying . Look . Men died to keep this secret . We don 't understand why , so we wanted to keep our research in-house for safety . - Research ? - That 's hit a dead end . I 'm uploading Skye 's blood scans . I would like to contact Agent Weaver at S.H.I.E.L.D. academy covertly . - For a little help . - But we must keep this between us . Please , I don 't want any ... trouble . You 're level five ? My level-six clearance gives me access to the holobox ... secure line . But we can 't sneak that in here , can we ? Agent Hand seems to be keeping everyone busy . We 'll be good . But , hey , we get questioned , let me talk . You 're a surprisingly bad liar , Agent Simmons . I know . But I 'm getting better at it . What do you mean , " noise " ? I mean literally noise across every S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel . Some sort of blanket signal . - Encoded data , maybe . - I think so . You want to fill us in ? We root you out ... a mole ... suddenly our plane shuts down , our communications jammed . I don 't know what 's happening . I wish I did . - You have to believe me . - No , I don 't . Do you read ? Do you read , 6-1-6 ? - Where 's that coming from ? - Close . Enemy aircraft on my tail . Over . - Garrett ? - Coulson , I 'm under attack . Drones . Repeat , S.H.I.E.L.D. drones are on my ass . - We 're not getting along . Do you copy ? - Copy . Garrett , what 's happening ? We 've lost control of our aircraft . Hell if I know . Tell me you got guns on that thing . I 'm coming to you . Ohh ! Fitz , can you manually wire the guns to weapons control , - bypass our system ? - If I have cables long enough , yeah . Skye , decode the signal . We need to get ahead of this . I don 't want any more surprises today . - What happened ? - She 's a sleeper . I mean the other kind of sleeper . Wait . What are you saying ? She 's been reporting on us this whole time . Controls are live , sir . Garrett , what 's your 20 ? I 'll be on top of you in seconds at your 10 : 00 . - Guns hot ? - Warming up . He needs to pull up , sir . Hey . Hey ! Garrett , pull up ! He knows what he 's doing . - Damn it . - That 's Joanie . Any thoughts on chachi ? Now it knows you 're here . Want to roll over , play dead ? Okay , Phil , but you better make it quick . I 'm running on fumes . I 'll pull up even of your six . Better not miss . Copy that . - Ready when you are , boss . - " Play dead . " What does that mean ? That means ... I better not miss . Boo-yah . The drones are down . Agent Garrett 's alive and docking with S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 . I suggest we send more men , shoot that airplane out of the sky . No . We couldn 't seize automated control of Garrett 's jet , so I wrote it off as a loss . But now that he 's with Coulson , we can cross him off with the rest when they land . Preserve the aircraft . You got something to say , Agent Shaw ? Apologies , ma 'am . I 'm just having a hard time killing the people we once called friends . Once that encoded transmission went out , everything changed . You understand that , don 't you ? We swore allegiance to each other . And today , that loyalty will be tested . If you waver ... you die . It 's a simple message repeated . Semantic encoding . I needed to find the mnemonic key . It should only take me a minute more to decipher . Can I ask the obvious question ? What the hell ? ! We don 't know . We don 't even know where our plane is headed . Oh , I saw your trajectory . You 're being tractor-beamed straight to the Hub . Those drones were launched out of there for sure . - Victoria Hand . - Hand ? Can 't be . - It can 't be what , now ? - The Clairvoyant . I thought Ward capped that guy . I don 't believe the man Ward killed was the Clairvoyant . I think he was an unwitting decoy meant to end our investigation . That 's a lot of trouble to go through for a red herring , don 't you think ? Because the Clairvoyant is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent using high-level clearance to stay ahead of us , make it seem like she 's got psychic abilities . " She " ? You think Victoria Hand 's the Clairvoyant ? I don 't mean to pee in the punch bowl , but that doesn 't make a lot of sense . I was stationed with Vic in Lisbon . She 's a hard-ass and a buzzkill at parties , I grant you , but do you really think she 's capable of that ? Excuse me . Didn 't she just try to blow you out of the sky ? Don 't get me wrong ... she 's definitely gone nuts , but her actions prove she 's not the Clairvoyant , right ? I mean , if she 's been hiding in plain sight all this time ... - why reveal herself now ? - Guys . " Out of the shadows , into the light . " Well , I 'll be . I thought Hydra was defeated after World War II . It was . S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded in the wake of that victory . - And now they 're back ? - Hydra always comes back . Cut off a head , two more will take its place . Is it a head ? I thought it was a limb . - No , no , no . " Cut off a head . " - " Cut off a limb . " It 's a head . But it was sent from a S.H.I.E.L.D. source . It 's got to be some sort of activation signal to Hydra members within S.H.I.E.L.D. - Hand must be one of them . - Okay , stop . Stop . W-what does that mean ? In S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Targeting level-eight agents , seizing power . - Wonder how deep it goes . - The signal 's everywhere . Deep . - You know what this means ? - Yeah . We 're screwed . We can 't change course , and we have no idea what 's waiting for us at the Hub . The Hub . I say we blow a hole in the side of this puppy and parachute out , live to fight another day . - We can 't . - It 's a cherry ride , I 'll give you that , but let 's not just hand over the keys . Simmons is at the Hub . We have to save her . Oh , crap . Yeah . Trip 's there , too . I don 't mind saying I don 't like the odds on this one . We should let your specialists out of their cage . - We can use every weapon we can get . - We 've got to save her . So we 'll fly in there , face the music even if it is the Hydra theme song . Agents Triplett and Simmons are unaccounted for , ma 'am . Searches are under way . They don 't have anywhere to go . Don 't underestimate Coulson 's people . Tie up those loose ends . - You 're positive this line is secure ? - Yeah , but be quick . Nothing looks more guilty than sneaking around . Well , I sent her a request . She must not have ... Agent Weaver , thank you for joining me . - I 'd been hop ... - Jemma . Thank god you 're still alive . What ? What 's wrong ? The Hub still secure ? Are you with your team ? - Get somewhere safe and lock the door . - What 's happening ? Have your commander report that the academy is under sie ... We don 't know how long Hydra 's been inside S.H.I.E.L.D. ... they are taking control ! Hydra ? What ? Where ? Everywhere ! Among us ! If you survive , you know where to find ... Jemma , don 't trust anyone ! What are you doing ? What the lady said to do ... locking the door . - Let me out . - Go ahead . This door won 't hold if they come looking , but they won 't come around this way for a little while . I 'm staying . Well , how do I ... know I can trust you ? Because I 'm trustworthy . You 're the one who works for the zombie robot back from the dead . Take it . If you try to kill me with it , I 'll know I can 't trust you . Now fire that thing back up . Let 's see if we can get our friends on the line . Can 't wait to tell them the good news . Coulson said you 're an informant . - Want to elaborate on that ? - No , I don 't . Damn icer . My head 's killing me . I deserve to know . Don 't start with that . We do our jobs . End of story . I can 't tell you any more until Fury gives the go-ahead . You 're good . I mean , I always heard you were good . But , man ... playing us this whole time , conning me , Coulson . I wasn 't playing anyone . I had your backs . And reported on us behind them . You know , you always said to keep my emotions in check . - But this is some next-level ... - And you should have listened . You killed a man in cold blood , let your emotions get the best of you . It was to protect our team from a monster ! It was to protect her ! Which would be okay if you hadn 't shot the wrong guy . Fitz repaired your direct line . If you have the ability to make this right , now 's the time , ' cause you can 't make it worse . I have orders not to do this with anyone else present . They 're taking out our guns . Get director Fury on the line , or I 'll march you out there first . - Sir , what is going on ? - A whole lot . - Who is shooting at us ? - Come here . Let me catch you up . Apparently , Agent Hand is the Clairvoyant , so chew on that first . Agent Melinda May . Voice command . Emergency protocol one . Emergency protocol one . Hello . This is an X10 straight connection to Director Fury 's personal line . Where is he ? Director Fury is dead . - Can that be true about Fury ? - Man was my S.O. Coulson 's , too . Proved himself more than once to be a hard man to kill . That sound outside doesn 't bode well , though . Is there anything on this plane you don 't want them to get their hands on ? That was his direct line , Phil . So it 's real . That means it 's just you and me , unless there were other parties you reported to . There weren 't . Then come out with it . Fury 's gone . We 're being shot at by our own people . Fury knew you 'd want me to join up , - asked me to keep an eye on you . - Looking for what ? Signs of physical or mental deterioration , to keep him updated . - It 's that simple . - Did you know about Tahiti ? How could you do that to me ? After all we 've been through , the years we spent together in ops ... He said it was essential you couldn 't know . The time I spent sifting through the ashes with you in Bahrain ? I gave you a second chance when I assembled ... - I assembled this team ! - What ? I evaluated what was needed , and I gave the assessment to Fury , and he gave you the parameters for your unit . What was needed , May ? Someone who could repair your body , a technician who could reprogram your brain , and a specialist to help me put you down if it had to be done . But I didn 't do it for Fury . I did it for you , to protect you ! I ... You mean a lot to me . A lot . To hear you were dead ... you may not believe me , but that 's the truth . And I have nothing to do with the Clairvoyant or this Hydra threat we 're up against . Hopefully this helps prove that . I want to believe you ... but you 've used that against me this whole time . They stopped firing . No clear shots through the windows . They want to preserve the aircraft . A surgical strike team is next . Fitz cut the hydraulics on the cargo ramp . - They 'll have to pry it open . - That won 't hold them long . We need to plan to get out of here with whatever we can take with us . About that . The 0-8-4 specs , Asgardian weaponry , portal creation , Donnie 's weather machine . If they get their hands on gravitonium in the fridge ... - It 's below the fridge . No records . - Okay , but on the off-chance we 'd give them the designs to weaponize it . The drug from Tahiti , sir ? All here . If Hydra is really about to seize this plane ... We should wipe the system . I 'm backing it up on this hard drive to keep our edge . - Then do it . Scrub the plane clean . - It 'll take some time . We 're working on buying you some . I 'm telling you , this signal is clogging everything up . Something terrible has happened . Freeze ! Show me your hands ! Show me your hands . Go ! Go ! Move ! Move ! It 's called a mouse hole . Cuts through anything , really . I designed it a year ago and submitted it for testing , but it never reached distribution . Top agents always hog the good stuff . You 're right . The hard drive 's safer in your hands . You haven 't taught me how to hold up under torture yet . We 'll get to that . It 's real fun . All right . Here 's where we split . - Skye and Ward ? - Heading to the nerve center . Disable their systems , most importantly , their control of our plane . - Copy that . - Remember , these agents are under orders . Use icers only . We 'll find Simmons , get her out . We should go straight for Hand . Hydra 's always talking about getting their heads cut off , right ? Saving Simmons and Triplett ... that 's our priority . I agree , and that 's how I 'd get it done . - Hope you have a better plan . - Phil , I can help you if you ... We need your help , but the cuffs stay on . The rest of your possibly very short lives hinges on this moment . Hydra has successfully infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. at the highest level . It only took seven decades , and today is our coming-out party . We have the support of the level-9 and level-10 agents . And those who have resisted Hydra have been crossed off ... Director Fury included . I 'm here to offer you a choice , and a simple one at that . Either swear unwavering loyalty to Hydra right now for all time ... or share Fury 's fate . I won 't wait long . Cross us off ... and one of you goes , too . Right answer . The number of people I trust is now seven . Where are we on the roundup ? We 're moving all agents below level five to East holding . I have men monitoring microphones placed in most of the rooms . And our strike team ? - Has stormed the plane , yes . - That was a ... a test ? - That very few have passed . - I thought we were dead . - You 're not Hydra . Thank god . - Well , don 't celebrate just yet . We may not be Hydra , but your friend Coulson ... he is . Oh . We captured Agent Coulson and the cavalry herself . Call upstairs . They 'll need assistance . - They 're headed to ... - here . We caught ' em , the slippery bastards . Agent May took one of mine in the arm . Softy there wouldn 't let her bleed out . - Whoa . Do you need medical assistance ? - Just your sidearm . Okay , come on , Simmons . Where are you ? What ? We 've searched the plane , ma 'am . No sign of it . They were on board when it landed . We are tearing this plane apart . They must have ... snuck off somehow . Check the tunnels . I want two squads posted in every corridor . Capture who you can , but you have permission to use lethal force . - Yes , ma 'am . - You were right . We should have blown that plane out of the sky . Are you mad ? How can you be saying this ? Hydra won 't show mercy . Neither can we . There is no way Coulson is Hydra ! - He is a good man , a friend ! - He 's a liar ! Agent Blake came to me with his suspicions ... that Coulson and the other level eights were involved in some sort of conspiracy . Then Coulson sent him on an op that put him in the I.C.U. Coulson is not capable of what you 're insinuating . Agent Jacobson , Coulson 's crimes ? Recruiting known enemies of S.H.I.E.L.D. , disobeying a direct order ... multiple counts , violation of international law . To rescue our beloved Professor Hall , who ended up dead by his hand . Failure to report the crimes of his protégé , Akela Amador . Whose same technology somehow ended up in the head of Mr. Peterson , and you know his crimes . You helped us save Coulson from the Clairvoyant . Yet when we found this brain-dead Clairvoyant , Coulson 's man Ward shot him before we could learn a single thing about him . The lies add up , Agent Simmons . Are you telling me he 's never kept a secret from you ? The worst thing you can do right now is to underestimate Hydra . They hide in plain sight . They earn our trust , our sympathy . They make us like them . And when you hesitate , they strike . If we 're to survive , we must learn to strike first . Damn . That processing center is at the end of that hall . - Give me your icer . - What are you gonna do ? - Pave the way for you . - There 's like a hundred guys out there . 12 . Level-five foot soldiers , basic armor package , and no other way through . The others are depending on us . - But it 's suicide . - Not if I don 't die . - And if I do ... - Wh ... slow down . ... maybe I deserve to . I killed an innocent man , Skye . You didn 't know . You thought you were doing the right thing . - You thought he was going to ... - To hurt you . If we make it out of this , maybe we can ... - grab a drink , you and me . - Are you ... Remember in that bar in Dublin , you offered to ... talk ? I didn 't want to talk . I needed to keep things compartmentalized . Like with May ? I 'm not an idiot . We live on the same plane together , for god 's sake . Well , with her , I knew I could . With you ... I didn 't want to risk it . I was offering to talk , Ward , not to have sex with you . I 'm not saying that . I 'm saying ... I want a chance to take you up on it , to have that talk . Look , I know I 'm not that guy . I 'm too locked-down , too boring . When we make it out of this ... yes , let 's have a drink . You said you might die , so ... what the hell ? Lock the door behind me . Aah ! Hey , you ... You should really look up the word " boring " in a dictionary . You ready to hack this system ? Who said anything about hacking ? There . Agent Hand . Outside the East wing situation room . This is definitely a situation . Is Simmons there ? We don 't move until we find Simmons . I 'll say it again . Best bet to save her ... use the ventilation system to get above the sit room . Drop down using Fitz 's sweet , little mouse hole , and put two bullets through Victoria Hand 's heart . Yeah , it 's an option , sir . - Without questioning ? - Questioning what ? Whether she wants to kill us fast or slow ? Last time we did that , we shot the wrong man . Because she wanted us to ! Phil , this is a battle for S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s soul , and we 're on the front lines . History will remember us this day . That 's right . It 's for S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s soul . And murder without consideration is a sure ... " Consideration " ? Consider this . She had one of my men killed with a bomb rigged to his gas pedal . The other two were floating in the hotel pool , and they weren 't doing the backstroke . But we can just as easily ice her . You don 't put someone like her on ice . She had Skye shot in the stomach ... In the stomach ... because she was curious . Mike Peterson ... burned alive and turned into some kind of freak . She tortured you , using the same machine she used to brainwash that bitch in the flower dress . And right now , she 's probably doing the same to Agent Simmons . Oh , I 've considered it plenty , my friend . - No . Simmons will be fine . - Just being realistic , kid . I never mentioned that . I 'm telling you , killing her quick would be a mercy . I never said ... Raina had been inside the machine . I never told that to anybody . - I must have read it in a report , then . - You weren 't with us . The point is , how many more have to suffer before Vic gets hers ? - You showed up right after . - What are you driving at ? After Skye was shot . Quinn said it was so I would lead the Clairvoyant to the cure . That 's exactly what I did . I walked you right in there with me . Phil ... look . It 's been a rough day . I-I get it . But you need to take a second and ... Damn it . - Freeze ! Don 't move ! - Hands where we can see them ! - Easy , fellas . - Take Agent Garrett into custody . He 's the murderer they call the Clairvoyant . He 's a traitor . Gentlemen , I know Agent Sitwell was in charge of filling your ranks , so at least a few of you know what to do in this situation . Anytime , boys . Hail Hydra . Hail Hydra ! Those three men in your unit ... I guess they asked the wrong questions . Until today , it was all about keeping the secret . - Are you gonna kill us ? - That wasn 't my plan , really . If it was , I could have done that anytime I wanted . No , Coulson and I go way back , back to the days when Fury was teaching us tactics ... Clearing corners , slicing the pie . - Remember , Phil ? - Fury would bury you for this . Probably . Instead , he 'll just have to roll over in his grave . He must have uncovered our secret . Top brass did what they had to do . Explains why we 've suddenly come " out of the shadows . " Not a minor inconvenience , I might add . - " Top brass " ? - Oh , my , yes . Tip-top . We had a good thing going , too ... waving the S.H.I.E.L.D. flag as hard as we could . - I guess we 'll be changing colors now . - For Hydra ? You really believe all that crap ... spreading death and destruction ? I wouldn 't say I 'm a true believer . Let 's just say I felt the wind changing direction and swung my sail . You really should , too . I would die before serving Hydra , you sick son of a bitch . I hate to tell you , but ... you 've been serving Hydra all along . I guess death is the only alternative . It 's a sad thing . I consider you a friend . I was happy when I heard you 'd made it through . So happy you had me tortured for three days to find out how they did it . I didn 't enjoy that . Phil , t-this is me being honest . No , John This is you being a psychopath . I know you 'd follow him to the grave , so ... As for you , Agent Fitz , you 'll hold a very high rank , run our tech division if you volunteer . If not , you 'll have no rank and a lot of pain . Of course , either way , your services will be required . You 're gonna suffer for what you 've done . And I ... I plan on being a very big part of that . I like you , kid . All right . Let them have it . But shoot that one in the kneecaps . Was that all of them ? It wasn 't as big as I thought ... Aah ! Coulson ! Hands up ! - I 'm not Hydra . - We heard ... everything . Who is ? How deep does it go ? Captain America has defeated the helicarriers at the Triskelion . - But his status is unknown . - And S.H.I.E.L.D. has fallen . Hydra factions have taken control of our East African headquarters and the Treehouse . And those are just the ones we know of . It 's gonna be a scramble , a power grab . I 'll head to the fridge . At least that facility is secure . I don 't need to remind you how imperative it is that it stay that way . And I 'll find Agent Garrett the smallest , darkest cell in the icebox . I 'd like to turn the key on that cell myself ... if you don 't mind , sir . He was my S.O. I feel I ... I should have known . - It was my duty to ... - No one knew . I didn 't know . That 's how he beat us ... by being a friend . I spent years with that bastard . Looked up to him . I want to see him suffer . Don 't mind the company , and I can always use a man of your skills . Pick up the pieces here at the Hub if you can , and , uh ... Only communicate using one of these . You and I may be the highest-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agents who aren 't Hydra or dead ... not that that means anything now . All we have is each other . So stay in touch , Agent Coulson . I guess you can ... call me Phil . It 's all gone . In pieces , at least . Skye , try to restore some of the firmware in the plane 's systems . Fitz-Simmons , get a crew together . Help May patch the holes . You still want me on board ? You 're not a friend . But I do believe you 're an ally . We need all the allies we can get . What are we planning to do next ? Survive . - Course is locked , ma 'am . - Good . He 's not telling stories now , is he ? You know what I 'm thinking , Agent Garrett ? I 'm thinking the icebox of the fridge is a little too comfortable for you . Maybe we should put you a little deeper underground . What do you think , Agent Ward ? You shot the wrong Clairvoyant before . Care to shoot the right one ? Did I tell you about this one time I was deep undercover ? The Sicilian backup team a no-show , of course . So I dropped in through the skylight , used up my whole mag , and I hit the final guy in the chest with a flare gun . Boy , you should have seen the look on his face when that thing went off . Oh , man , he didn 't know what hit him . Now , that 's what I call in-flight entertainment .

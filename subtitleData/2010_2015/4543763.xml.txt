 There is an alternate universe , and in it another version of us . Previously on Fringe ... We know who our enemy is now . His name is David Robert Jones . He 's a scientist . Jones is responsible for dosing Agent Dunham with Cortexiphan . For what purpose ? He was trying to activate some kind of latent ability . What are you doing , Olivia ? I 'm turning on the lights . I have discovered David Robert Jones ' true intentions . Jones is trying to collapse both universes . Mutual destruction . And create a world designed and controlled by him . Any way to stop Jones ? I 'm afraid we have to close the bridge . I think I shall miss them . Hi , Neal . Cafe mocha , 1 % , no whip ? - That 's it . - Jill , can you get that started ? That 'll be $ 4.80 . Enjoy . Are you okay ? What 's happening to them ? Don 't move . I think when they move , they die . Nobody move ! 4x21 - Brave New World - ( Part 1 ) Medford ? No . Holliston ? Uh , only if I am being punished . Wayburn ? Only if I 'm dead . All right . How about Lexington ? Three beds , central heat and air , dog run . Did you know that I had a lab when I was growing up ? No , I thought you were allergic . I was , but Walter made him non-allergenic . It 's got a working fireplace in the bedroom . Nursery ? Nursery ? Nursery . What 's he doing ? No ! O- - Over by the second woman ! The one that 's still smoking . No , you ninny . The next one over ! Walter . You are going to freeze , God ! Why must you always mother hen me ? I 'm quite capable of looking after myself . I know , but just humor me . Maybe I like doing it . We 're good . No airborne toxins . Thank you . Walter ! Don 't forget your- - - I need my kit . - Yeah . Please , do something . Help us . Maybe the deaths are associated with this mobile transaction . No , Walter , this is just how people pay for things now . Hmm ? Uh , he probably just bought that coffee . Huh . What will they think of next ? All we know far , at 3 : 23 P.M. more than two dozen people experienced some kind of spontaneous human combustion . You know that 's a myth , right ? There are survivors . Remaining still seems to have halted the ignition process . For now . Do we have any idea what 's caused this ? I 'm hoping Dr. Bishop can help shed some light on that . Okay , my friend . Let 's see what secrets you hold . Hmm . I- - I had a watch similar to this once . My uncle gave it to me . Uncle Heinrich . He loved rhubarb . - He was always- - - Am I gonna die ? I- - I can 't answer that . Not yet . What are you ? What am- - I 'm human . What are you ? Is this some sort of alien invasion ? Are you part of a strike f- - No , I mean- - I mean , what are you doing here ? Are you a doctor ? Oh , no . I 'm a scientist . Oh . Uh ... May I take a blood sample ? The discomfort will only be momentary . That 's what all you men say . You are very brave . Go on , then . I 'm sorry ... Um , where did you get this smudging on your fingertips ? I don 't know . The escalator , maybe ? Her blood definitely shows signs of a foreign incursion at the cellular level . Viral ? We 're gonna have to get it back to the lab to be sure . What sort of virus are you ? If you were aerolized , you would have infected everyone , not just those on the escalator . If you were harbored on a water tap or a doorknob , the first few contacts would have wiped you clean . What would have kept you fresh and so infectious , my lethal friend ? Agent , I think we found something . Oh , dear . This is not a virus at all . Well , then what is it ? The escalator is infested with nanites . Nanites ? Microscopic self-replicating robotics . There 's a machine that 's generating them . Despite their itty-bitty size , each of them is capable of storing a tremendous amount of energy , and it would seem they can be overloaded by the bio-kinetic energy stored in the cells of anyone infected . You mean , these people 's movement is what 's activating the nanites ? That 's what I just said . And the longer they are in the bloodstream , the more sensitive they become , so that the slightest exertion can trigger the overload . Causing them to spontaneously combust . Like a soda pop bottle after shaking . Okay , so who would do this , and how do we stop it ? I don 't know . I need my lab . But we can 't move them , Walter . How are we gonna get one of these people to your- - Very carefully . Walter , we can 't risk it . I don 't know how long they have left , even without moving them . I can 't be certain . Do you have any kind of insurance ? I mean , if I volunteer for your experiment and something goes wrong , what happens , you know , to my next of kin ? The Bureau takes care of you . Everybody that we work on is fully-covered . It 's in the regs . Okay . You can use me . Whatever you need . I 'm sorry , what 's your name ? Jessica Holt . Do you know what you 're saying , Jessica ? Yeah , I do . I need a solid-board stretcher . Uh , and some ice packs and a blanket . Must seem a little bizarre , huh ? Well , I 'm an ER nurse . Night shifts on Fridays , that 's bizarre . If there anything that I can do to make it a little more pleasant , please let me know . Actually , there is . Um , could you get my phone for me , please ? It 's in my handbag . Of course . Thank you . Mike , it 's me . No , I know . Um . Yeah . Listen , I , um , I need you to pick up Sarah after school for me , please . No , I- - I know it 's not your day , um , but , you know , please , Mike . Um , I 'll explain it to you later , okay ? Okay , bye . - Thanks . - Of course . Olivia , how long until this antidote is ready ? I 'll just check with Walter . How close are we ? We 're starting to see first results now . But how long is it going to take ? At this rate , it 's gonna be at least a couple more minutes . Hey , Walter , her temperature 's rising rapidly . How rapidly ? Uh , two degrees in the past 23 seconds . What about an ice bath ? No , that won 't help . Just try to keep her calm . Jessica ? Jessica , I just want you to focus on me , okay ? - Okay . - Peter , grab the ammonium nitrate . You want to speed up the condensation ? Unless you have a better idea . Walter , she 's at 104 degrees . Uh , we need 60 seconds more . We don 't have 60 seconds . Oh , my God . Get away from me ! Oh , here . Jessica , just focus on your breathing . Walter ! 40 sec- - Seconds more ! How are you doing that ? Her temperature 's dropping . Oh- - She 's okay . How did you do that ? I have no idea . This should permanently remove and neutralize the nanites in your system . Thank you . I can breathe now . You and a lot of other people . Walter , do you have any idea what just happened to me ? I could make an educated guess . Cortexiphan has given you certain kinetic powers . Moving molecules so quickly that you can create spontaneous combustion , yes ? Well , perhaps in this case , you slowed the molecules down , causing her to cool down . But how did I do it ? I 'm afraid I have no idea . I should get her home . You 'll let me know what happens with the others , then ? I will , but now that the antidote 's been synthesized , they 'll all be fine , thanks to you . Thank you . I don 't know how you did it , but you did . You know , not everybody would volunteer to be Walter 's Guinea pig . It wasn 't really for me . I 've got a four-foot-tall redhead at home who 's constantly in dire need of mac and cheese and help with her math . And her father 's an idiot . Well , if you ever need help getting to the head of the line in an ER ... And listen , if you find that you have any more symptoms , give me a call . I will . Thank you . Thank you . Thanks . Bye . Dunham . We know who 's responsible for the nanites . This was taken ten minutes before the first victim was reported . Another camera picked him up leaving the scene , but we lost him after that . Well , at least we know Jones is in our universe . So what does infecting a bunch of people with nanites have to do with ending the world ? I mean , everything Jones has done has been in service of collapsing our two universes in order to create a third . But destroying the bridge ruined that plan . As far as we know . You think he found another way to create his own universe in place of ours ? I don 't know . But we do know Jones . We know he 's not gonna just give up . No . That can 't be . A chimeric structure in nanites . I don 't believe it . That was Olivia . David Robert Jones is definitely behind this . Walter , what is it ? A hundred different ways to design a nanite , and he chose this . It 's inconceivable . Not by chance . Jones isn 't smart enough , not by himself . Wait , what are you saying ? Jones didn 't create these nanites . They 're not his design ! There 's only one person who would construct this particular pattern . Who ? I have bad news , sir . Agent Dunham has stopped us again . Don 't be so sure . Olivia beat us today . Clearly , you don 't seem concerned . Don 't confuse a winning move with a winning game . This board never changes . How long do you take between moves ? Since the last move ... About 20 years . In this game , the skill one must have above all else is patience . The board changes , but very slowly . The art of chess , the art is knowing when a piece is most valuable , and then , in that very moment , being willing to sacrifice it . For in the vacuum created by the loss of what is most precious , opportunity abounds , influence is maximized , and desire becomes destiny . For example , on this board , the most valuable piece is the bishop , therefore , for the game to be won ... The bishop must be sacrificed . I 'll attend to it . Promptly . He 's alive . I 'm telling you , he 's alive . I knew that Jones 's plan was too ingenious , too remarkable , that it had to have come from Belly . He 's alive , Nina . The nanotech that Jones used on the escalator , I 've examined them . They were built by Belly . I- - I 'd recognize his work anywhere . His methodology was all ov- - Jones had access to many projects at Massive Dynamic . He could simply have copied William 's research- - Nina , it was the work of a master , not an imposter ! I know the difference . Walter said that Bell died in a car accident on new year 's day seven years ago ? Yes . I went to the hospital . I saw his body . But it wasn 't new year 's , it was Christmas . I- - I always thought that he died on new year , because he came to visit me the night before to say goodbye . Walter , what are you talking about ? When I was in St. Claire 's , Belly came to visit me . It was new year 's eve , 2005 . They gave me additional shocks that day just to celebrate , so I can 't remember what he said . Nina , I know you loved him- - Oh , Walter , just stop it ! The car crash wasn 't an accident . William had lymphoma . He 'd been trying to fight it , but ... I think he didn 't want me to see him that way anymore . He didn 't want to be vulnerable . He wanted to go out on his own terms , and he did . - It 's still possible- - - Oh , Walter , anything is possible , but the man I knew wouldn 't try to destroy a universe . That doesn 't sound like William . Fine . I 'll prove it to you . If my son is not too busy monitoring my cure , I 'd like him to meet us . Where ? Well , well ... Wally Bishop . Hey , doc , you just visiting , or are you coming back to stay for awhile ? Good news . The administrator can see us now . Everything okay ? Fine . I 'm sorry , we 're still transitioning to a more up-to-date record-keeping system . Federal funding isn 't all it used to be . In fairness , I 'm told it never was particularly good , so , technically , it never was what it used to be . I guess now it 's just worse . But I 'm confident these are all the visitor logs during the period of Dr. Bishop 's- - Incarceration . I was going to say " treatment . " It has a nicer sound , and I like to think is more reflective of what we do here . Would you , now ? What about your surveillance archives ? Uh , security cameras ? I 'm afraid our current mainframe storage capacity is limited . The institution doesn 't keep anything older than two years . How convenient . Walter , Dr. Benlo has been cooperating fully . Do you see anything in those that suggests the logs have been doctored ? No . Matter of fact , they 're perfect . Very thorough . Every single individual logged in and out . And ? No William Bell . Walter , you said you had been having a lot of shock therapy . Do you think perhaps he could have been a hallucination ? No . No , no . My hallucinations were rarely biped and never men . Dr. Bishop , are you- - Crazy ? No . May I borrow this ? Uh , um , well , those records have already been digitized , I- - I- - Thank you . Let 's go . Thank you . I must say , you 're much prettier than your predecessor . I still don 't know why Walter needed that log book , and he 's not telling me , and he won 't back off that Bell thing , either . Oh , man . - Oh . - One , second , hold on . I got it . - God . - Oh , that 's got to smart . That 's what happens when you drink and mince . Thank you . What 's the matter ? You worried about Walter too , 'cause honestly , you shouldn 't be . I 'm sure he 's- - No , I 'm not thinking about Walter . I was thinking about that girl , Jessica . Oh , one encounter with us and her child almost becomes an orphan . And we deal with this every day . We 're playing the odds , Peter . I mean , what do you really think our chances are of having a normal life ? Olivia , I know you 're scared about what happened in the lab yesterday . I don 't know what 's happening to me . What I 'm becoming . I 've got this- - This power inside me that terrifies me because I don 't understand it , and I just- - I just want it out . Okay . So we 'll figure it out . Together . Is that a personal guarantee ? After all we 've been through , I will not lose you again , Olivia . I 'm starving . What 's a guy got to do to get a good home-cooked meal around here ? Where are you now ? We 're just passing Kenmore Square . Now , what do you mean , it 's the sun ? Well , even though we can 't see it , it 's still there in the sky . Jones must be reflecting the light off of something , like one of those disco balls , and then focusing it , like we do with a magnifying glass . Well , how is he doing that ? Well , I 'm not sure yet , but I have my suspicions . Yeah , Farnsworth . Agent ID JH112402 . And why is he doing it ? Seems like he 's trying to burn a hole to China . It 's a myth . Technically , it would be India , but I doubt it . What does this have to do with nanites ? And how do we even know it 's Jones ? So you are now prepared to concede that this may well be the work of William Bell ? - Not my point . - Okay , thanks . Satellite imagery ? Yeah , I just got access to the system . Radio waves . It 's coming online right now . I need geological data on Beacon Hill . Walter , which one of these do you want me to do first ? All of them . Uh , you said that Agent Broyles was on-site ? Is he evacuating the area ? Yes , one square mile from the center of the beam . Okay , Walter , the geological 's printing . Oh , no . Oh , no , what ? I knew I 'd read something about this . Three months ago , a subterranean oil reservoir was discovered below Beacon Hill . What does that mean ? Imagine putting a match to a can of lighter fluid . Unless we stop this soon , the sunbeam will essentially set Boston on fire from below . Uh , Peter , you should alert Agent Broyles . Tell him that he 'll need to evacuate an area uh , with a radius much wider than one mile . Well , how much ? All of it . All of what ? Boston . We 'll call you back . Walter , you 're right . There is a radio frequency that 's not owned by the government that 's transmitting in the S-band . What 's the frequency ? 2202.518 . Actually , there 's two frequencies . What ? Also .520 . Of course . You brilliant bastard , Belly . Quick , give me something to write on . Dunham . Turn around , head south ! Towards Beech Street , on the edge of Chinatown . Why ? What 's there ? I believe that 's where Jones is commanding the satellites from . What satellites , Walter ? I think Jones has commandeered two private satellites , or maybe he 'd launched them , and they 're the disco balls that are bouncing the sunlight around the planet . In any case , I have triangulated the signals , and they appear to be coming from the 1600 block off Beech Street . Interrupt the signals and you shut off the sun . Well , you know what I mean . Okay , we 're on our way . Ah ! Get me a knife . My lemon cake 's ready . Walter , if you were hungry , I could 've gotten you something . This is not about food , Athos , this is about Bell . Where 's the knife ? Please , quickly ? Hoo . All right . This is the 1600 block . See anything ? Peter , look . That antenna . Do you think that 's what 's controlling the satellites ? Could be . There 's the other one . Okay , I 'll take this one , you take the other one . Okay , but I don 't know what I 'm supposed to do . We got to turn them off . We 'll just figure it out when we get up there . Oh , my God , that smells terrible . What is it ? Lemon cake , laced with pig brain . - What ? - Hmm ? Lemon cake is the perfect incubator . And I thought it was easier to get pig brain on short notice than a human specimen . Is that from the- - The log book at St. Claire 's ? Just the relevant page . First tried scraping it , hoping Belly left some DNA behind , but he was too clever for that . Or maybe he was never there in the first place . I know none of you believe me , which is why I have conducted this little experiment . The pig brain is activating a little-known side effect of Cortexiphan , which is temporary tissue regeneration . Heated between 90 and 100 degrees , the Cortexiphan I have added to the pig brain should cause at least partial regeneration of all biological matter on the sheet of paper , and voila , fingerprints ! Although ... Identifying Belly 's prints from these smudges may prove impossible , after all . What is that brown mark ? I don 't know . Walter . As I said , Cortexiphan is regenerative . You shouldn 't eat it , though . Almond oil . I knew it ! Chilean almonds ! Almonds ? Belly was obsessed with them . Even had an agreement with the importers . They sold them to him wholesale . Must 've had the oil on his fingertips . Walter , what are you doing ? I 'm going to find Belly . A1 Imports , down by the seaport . Walter , would you stop ? This is nuts . I am not crazy . At least I 'll be able to confirm that he 's still alive . Would you excuse me ? Oh . What about Olivia and Peter ? They 're doing everything they can . There 's nothing we can do to help them . What do you think you 're gonna find there ? Walter . Walter ! I know this is a wild goose chase , a fool 's errand , and I 'm a fool , but no one is asking you to join me , Alex . It 's my hunch , and I 'm quite capable of pursuing it on my own , so peace out . - I don 't- - - Drive . Alex ? I was on a roll . Mm-hmm . Got it . You found the control panel ? - Yeah . - Now find the dial ... Marked " Transmission Amplitude . " That 's the one that needs to be tuned all the way down . Okay , got it . But not yet ! Not- - not- - not yet . Sorry . We have to do it together . If we don 't , the beam could go off-kilter , cut a swath across Boston . It 'd be sort of like " don 't cross the streams , " just , you know , in reverse . You know I have no idea what you 're talking about . Yes , I know . Okay , tell me when . Okay , in three ... Two ... One ... Go . We did it . Good job . Oh ! Oh ! Oh . Ooh ! Jones ! Oof . Ah ! Ah ! Oh ! - Hey ! Security ! - I--I 'm FBI . - Drop your weapon ! - I- - I can show you my badge . I said , drop it ! Now ! How did you- - ? Oh ! Aah ! Aah ! Aah ! Ugh ! I got it wrong . I was the sacrifice . I was the bishop . Ugh . Tail fins ? Yes . Tail fins , whitewall tires , two-tone paint jobs . Oh , sure , by today 's standards they 're terrible for the environment , but , oh , there 's something to be said for style . A1 Imports . Come on , dear . Walter , they 're probably not even- - Ye of little faith . It 's just as I remember it . I used to accompany Belly here on his visits . Not a smell you forget . - It smells like sweat . - Exactly . Hello ? Hello , sir . My name is Walter Bishop . I 'm sorry to trouble you so late . I was hoping to speak with Ms. Weisberg . I 'm sorry , who ? Lynn Weisberg . Uh , lovely woman , yea high . Nice laugh . Walter , I don 't think he knows her . Hmm ? She 's the owner . Or she was . I- - I- - I was hoping to ask her about a particular customer . Oh , I think I get it . You 're talking about that import / export company . Well , they went out of business , three years ago . Oh , I see . Tom , do you copy ? Yes , I 'm here . Coming right now . Look , I have to go . Um , thanks for your help . Sorry to have bothered you . No bother . Maybe we should ask around . Maybe someone else- - - Walter , he had a gun . - What ? Well ... It 's a dangerous neighborhood . Whatever the reason , there are no almonds here . Did you hear that ? Yes . - Walter ! - Come on . Come on . Walter . What are those ? One of them sounds almost like a rhino , but more nasal . I 'm sorry . We were leaving , and then we heard a noise . Go and tell him we have visitors . Sir , I 'm with the FBI . You 're making a mis- - Stop ! Hands where I can see ' em . Look , this is all just a misunderstanding . Aah ! Walter , come on ! Oh . Whoa ! Oh ! Oh . Oh ! Oh ! No ! No ! I 'm not sure I ever thought I would see you again . Hello , old friend .

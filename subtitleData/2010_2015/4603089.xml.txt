 13 Bannerman Road is where Sarah Jane Smith lives and it 's home to things way beyond your imagination . There 's an extraterrestrial supercomputer in the wall , her son , a genetically engineered boy genius , a school girl investigator across the road , and a whole universe of adventure right here on the doorstep . Ah ! Ready ? Always . 'Is there anything more beautiful than a star-filled sky ? 'As a child , I would dream of what might be up there 'but never imagined that one day I would find out . 'The fiery rings of Coulabria , 'interstellar lightning across the Voorheiden Horizon . 'I 've seen the death of worlds and the birth of stars . 'So many wonderful sights ... 'and things to terrify ... ' .. even here on Earth . 'Because , although it 's easy to forget , 'we 're a part of the universe too 'and we really aren 't alone . 'Sometimes , the most amazing people and creatures 'can find their way to Earth 'and so can the most terrifying . ' RUMBLING CLATTERING BEEPING 'Life here can be an adventure too . ' 'But after all my adventures , the last thing I expected was a family . 'And that 's been the most amazing adventure of all . ' I 've got to go soon . Saturday is band night at the Student Union . You 're going to watch a band ? ! We are talking music here ? Electric guitars , drums . Not some physics experiment with elastic , right ? Clyde . Don 't be soft . Soon Luke will have seen more cool new bands than you 've ever heard of . You 'll be so after my tunes next time I 'm home . Oh , Luke , I can 't wait . Look , I 've got to go now , so I 'll catch you later . Love you . Right . Homework . Yeah . Luke will be back soon . Clothes all over the place . Empty mugs . Dirty plates . Lots of loud music . You 're right . I should make the most of the peace and quiet . Night-night . Night , Sarah Jane . See you tomorrow . DOORBELL RINGS Hello ? What ... ? ! Oh ... Why would anyone leave you on a stranger 's doorstep ? BABY CRIES Oh ! TEXT MESSAGE ALERT All the bulbs in the house ? Even the fridge ? I 'm telling you , Haresh , that 's not normal . I 'll get an electrician to check the wiring on Monday . I hope we 're not on a ley line . I saw this programme on telly . They run all over the country connecting sites of ancient power like Stonehenge and the White Horse . What , the pub on Bishton Street ? Very funny , aren 't you ( ) You should give up teaching and become an undertaker . Where are you off to in such a hurry ? Sarah Jane 's . Luke 's texted me - he can 't get an answer . Wants me to check up on her . It 's probably nothing . Bye ! Phone 's probably on the blink . It 'll be the ley lines . Here , how many comedy headmasters does it take to change a light bulb ? Sarah Jane , what 's ... Shh ... .. that baby doing in your arms ? Shh ! Don 't make her cry . She cried earlier , and every light in the house blew ! In the street , more like ! I got what you said in your message , but what do you want nappies for ? I feel that should explain everything , but actually I 'm even more confused . I found her on the doorstep . I was going to call the police , but I don 't think they 'll have much luck finding her parents . Not on this planet . It 's all right . Luke was born a 13-year-old boy . A teenager I can handle . But a baby ? An alien baby ? I need help . Don 't look at me . Or me . Obviously . Well , your mums must know . If I start asking Mum questions about how to look after a baby , well , she 's going to totally freak ! Besides , she 's an alien . What do any of us know ? What about Mr Smith ? Ah , Mr Smith won 't come out . Well , would you , if you might get your circuits fried ? With most babies , all you have to worry about is poo and puke . Yeah , well , this one doesn 't blow bubbles , she blows things up ! I only know one way to shut up a baby . See ? Happy tummy , happy baby . Whatever planet you 're from . I 've looked after my little cousin a few times ... not that she 's an alien . You 're a natural , Clyde . Yeah . Well , little kids are cute . Aren 't you , Sparky ? Do you think so ? I always think babies look a bit rubbery . Her mum and dad will be out of their minds with worry . They must be scouring the galaxy . Maybe . Maybe not . Whoever left her on my doorstep , that was no accident . I think someone needs me to protect this baby . Protect her from who ? That 's what we have to find out before they come looking for her . What is that ? Oh , God . You 're flesh . Good . Who ... who are you ? My name is Miss Myers . And you 're going to help me find my child . I 've scanned her . Give the readings to Mr Smith . Hopefully he can give us a clue who she is and where she came from . Received and understood . If Sparky blows her top again , we don 't want her anywhere near Mr Smith . Right . Time to get clear of Bannerman Road . Park should be safe enough . Yep . Oh , no ! There you are , Rani ! Is there something you 've not been telling us , Sarah ? Mum , there is a simple explanation . You 've started fostering , haven 't you ? How wonderful ! I always thought you made such a perfect mum to Luke . Oh , thank you , Gita . No wonder Luke couldn 't get you on the phone . Bet she 's a proper little handful . Aren 't you ? Aren 't you , my ... ? Yes , well , it was all a bit sudden , really . I practically opened the door and there she was , like she 'd fallen out of the sky . Oh , like that thing last night . What 's her name ? Her name ? What thing last night ? Heard it on the local radio . A meteor landed in that wreckers ' yard on Peel Road . A meteor ? She must have a name , Sarah ? Sky . Sky ? Yeah , like she 'd fallen out of it . Oh , that 's beautiful . Just like you . CAR ALARMS BLARE Oh , flippin ' heck ! First all the light bulbs and now the car alarms ! I 'll catch up with you later . An alien baby turns up on your doorstep and a meteor crashes on the same night ? That 's , like , a galactic coincidence . We should check it out . Clyde , give me my watch back . Mr Smith can analyse the scan later . We need to check out what 's landed in the wreckers ' yard . What ? What are you doing ? There 's no baby seat . The last thing I need is her blowing the car 's electrics . And make sure Mr Smith stays out of harm 's way . You 'll be fine . You 're a natural . Look after her , Clyde . Someone left her here because she 's in danger . I 'm relying on you . Yeah , yeah . Don 't worry . Take a power nap , boys . I 'm looking for a power surge in the area . Last night . Here . Exploding light bulbs . Bannerman Road . Don 't worry , baby . Mummy 's coming to get you . CLANKING FOOTSTEPS So you think Sky 's in danger ? Why else would anyone leave her on my doorstep ? What 's got me confused is , who put her there ? The Doctor ? He 'd never leave her and take off without a word . You can 't come through . It 's dangerous . It 's all right . Miss Smith is quite used to danger . Professor Rivers ! Good to see you again . Come through , come through . Thank you . So , where 's the meteor ? Good question . We know a body impacted . Our seismographs at the Pharos Institute recorded it . You don 't really need a seismograph to see that , Professor . Well , this was no meteor , and these energy traces don 't look like any life form I 've ever seen before . You mean an alien ? Sarah Jane ! Whatever landed last night , it had big boots . Not only big ... but heavy . Very heavy . Whatever was here ... there 's something else now . Something alien ? No . Human . Hello ! No , no , no . It 's all right . I only want to talk . After him ! He might have seen something ! Oh , wait for me ! I 'm in Wellingtons ! I wasn 't doing anything wrong . What have you been living off ? Battery Bunnies ? They 're for my radio . Not that it works since that great , ruddy , iron bloke dropped down last night ! Yeah , well , my name is Sarah Jane Smith . I 'm a journalist . I just want you to tell me what you saw . The press ? I 'm not talking to you . I 've seen what you put in the papers about people that have seen what I 've seen . I do read them , you know . You can trust Sarah Jane . And I won 't be able to listen to The Archers now . What if I fix your radio for you , will you tell me what you saw ? With a lipstick ? I 'm homeless , I 'm not brainless . RADIO PLAYS It works ! You fixed it ! How did you do that ? What sort of batteries do you use in that thing ? And the big bad Bane went BANG , and everyone got covered in gunk ! SKY GURGLES No , no ! Don 't ! Don 't ! PHONE RINGS This is Clyde . Speak to me . Thanks , Sparky ! Flat as Jedward . SKY GURGLES No , no ! Don 't cry ! Come on , think , Langer , you 're a born entertainer . Say hello to ... Sid the Sleeve . Hello , Sky . Hello , Sid . What do you call a man who wears paper trousers ? I don 't know , Sid . Russell ! Yeah ? D 'you get it ? No . Too advanced , obviously . No , no , no . Don 't cry , don 't cry . Please , I just want you to tell me exactly what you saw . You saw an iron man . Like a robot ? Did I say he was a robot ? No . I know what a robot looks like - I 've seen Star Wars . This was a bloke . His skin was all metal ... And what happened ? Fell out of the sky . And then stood up without a scratch on him . And turned himself invisible . Invisible ? That 's right . And I 'm telling you this , he was armed to his flaming big steel choppers . If there 's any more of them on the way ... we don 't stand a chance . A metal man ? Is that even possible ? A bio-metalloid life form . Why not ? It 's a big universe . But now it 's here and it 's got to be looking for Sky . Oh , Clyde 's not answering . Whatever it is , we have to find it before it finds Sky . Ah , it 's invisible . Well , nothing 's ever completely invisible . Ooh , there you are . What have I missed ? Celeste , do you have equipment on your van that can track an ultra-high - frequency electromagnetic signal ? OK . No computers out here , no alien tech , no phones . You 're safe . Oh , you like leaves ? Leaves are good . Leaves are green . But not salad . Salad 's green but it 's also kind of yeuch . Hello , Mr Chandra . We 're from West London Power . This wouldn 't be about all the bulbs blowing , would it ? There was a power surge in Bannerman Road . We 're visiting every house , looking for the cause . It needs to be isolated . Whatever crashed here emitted UHF electromagnetic radiation . That 's what scrambled the radio . Whatever made those footprints might be able to make itself invisible , but it can 't hide that energy trace . There 's something here . A regular UHF-ME pulse . And ... it 's moving . Right towards Bannerman Road . Try Clyde again ! Warn him , he has to get Sky away from there ! Who 's Sky ? A defenceless child , and there 's something after her . He 's still not answering ! Come on ! Thank you , Celeste . Oh , my pleasure . Oh , and be careful . Oh , I 'm never careful . Always prepared . Zap ! Zap-zap ! Every light in the house went . I don 't suppose West London Power are going to reimburse me for those . I 'm afraid not . Mrs Chandra , do you have young children ? No . Just our daughter , Rani . She 's 17 . And very clever . She 's going to be a journalist . What do children have to do with your company blowing our lights ? And your going blow a blood vessel , Haresh , if you don 't calm down . Would you like a cuppa , my darlings ? Now , our neighbour over the road ... she 's just fostered a baby . Earl Grey ? And that 's a tree . And ... Oh ! And this is grass . Cows eat grass . And they go " moooo " and they make milk . You like milk , don 't you ? They also make steak . I like steak . Especially with chips . But they have to come from the chippie and not from the oven . Oven chips are the work of bad cooking goblins . CLUNKING Did you hear something ? It was more like ... feel something ... Oh ... what made those ? CLUNK-CLUNK Oh , this is not good . Not good at all . Not getting any better ! Oh-oh . Hi . Get in if you want the child to live ! Who are you ? I 'm her mother ! Drive ! Did you hear that ? Don 't worry . After the lights exploding and all the car alarms going off , it 'll probably be the gas mains blowing up . Just a regular day on Bannerman Road . I don 't know about you , Sky , but my mum always told me never to take lifts off strangers . Clyde ? Clyde ? He 's not here . Clyde ! Mr Smith ! I need you - now ! Sarah Jane . What can I do for you ? I need you to find Clyde . Connect with every CCTV camera in London , every speed camera ... whatever it takes just find him . There are 521,321 CCTV cameras in operation across London , Sarah Jane . It may take some time . Just do it ! Maybe he 's just taken Sky for a walk ? He is at the Summerwell Nuclear Power Station . Well , that didn 't take long . I was lucky , it was only the 10,052nd camera I checked . Who is that woman ? My name is Miss Myers . That doesn 't sound like much of an alien name . We don 't spell it the same way . Now give me the child . No , no , no . Answers first . What was that thing back there and why is it after the baby ? And what are we doing here ? Come on . My child has a destiny - a destiny to change worlds ... and that some will do anything to destroy . Like Tin Man back there ? Mm-hmm , the Metalkind . The enemies of my species . Of all flesh . But I don 't get it . She 's just a baby . How could you even begin to understand ? You might be flesh , but you are Earth flesh . Just a few evolutionary twists from protozoa . Now give me my child ! I don 't think so . Get him ! Typical . I 'm in the middle of a nuclear power station and I 'm carrying Baby Bang Bang ! Find the boy ! Looks like a back door to me . See why would that woman take Clyde and Sky to a nuclear power station ? I don 't know , but you 've seen the effect she has on anything electrical . Imagine what could happen there . Come on , we may not have much time ! Oh ... How perfect . You see , a baby will always find her mother . Give her to me . No ! What are you going to do to her ? Take her home , of course . She is the saviour of my kind . She will be the stuff of legend . Now give her to me ! Clyde , Clyde , run ! Oh , boy ! The flesh-whelp must be destroyed ! No ! Get back ! I won 't let you hurt this child ! She is no child . She is a weapon . And she is unprimed . She isn 't ready for this . You have doomed us all ! What 's going on ? Sky 's energy , it 's flooding out of her ! Yes ... the weapon is priming itself ! Your presence has activated it . The Doom of the Metalkind is come ! Sky ? METALKIND : I am too late . Who am I ? How did she transform into a teenager ? Sky 's synthetic DNA was programmed for this level of maturity to maximise her effectiveness . The flick of a switch , it will summon all Metalkind . You 're bringing your war to Earth ! Sky , stop it ! Whatever you choose , Sarah Jane Smith , Sky will fulfil her destiny . The end is nigh !

 - Whoa ! - Aah ! Aah ! Whoa , big guy ! Someone needs to ease off on the cheeseburgers . Skip the insults . Start the containment . Like its feelings are gonna get hurt . One fat ' n ' ugly going down ! Huh ? Que-what ? ! Rex ? Rex ! ♪ So make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way ♪ ♪ we 're gonna have fun tonight ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ ♪ so make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ make way to start the revolution ♪ ♪ so make way ♪ Goal ! You want to explain this ? I don 't know . It 's like some weird vision of this thing filled my head , then built itself out of me . Maybe the vision came from Blobbo . Maybe it 's trying to talk to me . Come on , big boy ! Send me some more pictures ! What 's on your mind ? Groceries , that 's what 's on its mind . Skip it . I 'm over it . That vision must 've been a fluke . All right , then , we 're going with a two-prong attack . Use caution . This kind of evo might be a splitter . Rex ! Snap out of it ! Whoa ! Whoa ! I wasn 't supposed to do that , right ? Rex , I want you back at H.Q. But I feel okay now . A - and we 've got , um ... Two blobs to put down . Now ! No trace of any recent electrochemical or DNA abnormalities . Everything reads normal . But it 's like the visions were being transmitted and I was seeing it from a nanite point of view . I can 't track it , Rex . There 's no sign of signal displacement or a nano disturbance . Maybe we should consider the possibility that this is psychological . Pizza . I think he 's having another vision . Of lunch ? With pineapple and salmon . Yeech ! He is nuts . Aside from a strange choice in pizza toppings , all readings are normal . I can 't explain it . Well , if my nanites are trying to get me to build something , maybe we should give them what they want . Whatever it is , I 'm not eating it . Is that my electric toothbrush ? It better not be ! It 's the one I 've been using . Oh . This is what I 'm seeing in my head ... As stupid as it looks . It 's like someone or something is sending me instructions to build some big device . Or build a pizza with pineapple and salmon . Okay , I 'm not sure about that vision . Is that my hair dryer ? I just need to figure out what it does . Maybe it 's a time machine or ... Or alien technology ! Maybe it 's just a big pile of junk or a way to order a really awful pizza . Target acquired . - Rex ! - Wake up ! Whoa ! Six , we need you back at headquarters . Ugh ! Hey , where do you think you 're going ? ! We 've got a security breach ... ground floor ! Lockdown protocols enabled ! All hands report to duty stations ! Security teams , take positions ! Sorry , guys , I might be a little late . Cease compression ! Release ! Ohh ! Figures I 'd build a machine with a serious attitude problem . Rex ? Is that you ? Who 's asking ? It 's me ... Caesar ... Your brother ! Mijo ! You 're alive ! And older . Atomic clock was right . - Esta es una problema grande . - Uh , yeah , it is a big problem . What is this place ? ! Who are you people ? ! I 'm getting you out of here . Sorry , amigo . Put your hands up . Or don 't . I got a clear shot either way . A talking chimp ? Don 't bother . I 've heard all the jokes . Have they hurt you ? Are you okay ? Stand aside ! Hello ? Do I get a say in this ? If you 're part of some elaborate plan to kidnap Rex , then you failed ! Listen , bonita , you don 't want to make me use this ! Enough ! Normally around here when someone barges in talking crazy , they get ground into the deck plates by my giant fists . But you seem legit . - I 'm going with him . - Rex ! Okay , brother , lead the way . So , if you are my brother , where have you been all this time ? I 'll explain later when we 're safe . Uh , this is Providence . We are safe . Usually . Providence ? Never heard of it . To be honest , the last five years has been a bit of a blur . I want to believe you , but I 'm gonna need some proof . Your name is Rex Salazar . Our parents are Violeta and Rafael . The last time I saw you was at the applied nanite research lab in Abysus , right before those fools triggered a replication cycle . And I have total amnesia , so for all I know , that could be completely bogus . There 's a scar on the back of your left knee you got when you were 7 , riding the gantry arm in the reactor annex . Hmm . I always wondered how I got that . Nice wheels . Don 't even think about it . It 's okay . Six isn 't going to hurt you , right , Six ? You 're coming in a little late on this , but , uh , this is Caesar ... My brother . And he wants to get me out of here . So , let 's just let my brother have his way and see where this all goes . Wherever you plan on going , they 're going to follow us . You know that , right ? They can try . I don 't know . Providence ships are pretty fast . Track Rex 's bio signature and find out who that guy really is . You ain 't kidding . This thing moves fast . A - are we in the Arctic ? How do you think I got to your location so quickly once the locater signaled me ? Locater ? You sent me the schematics to build that thing ? It tried to crush me like a bug ! Sorry , mijo . I wasn 't trying to hurt you . I was looking for what 's hiding inside of you . The Omega One nanite . That thing ? Holiday discovered it before . We had no idea what it was . I sent a signal instructing the Omega One to track and contain . But since the nanite has integrated into your DNA , you became the conduit for building the machine . What I don 't get is how the Omega One got inside of you . Rylander was supposed to have that under lock and key . Rylander ? He 's the one that put it inside me . Why would he do a thing like that ? I 'm really gonna have to let that old fool have it when I see him . Not possible ... courtesy of Van Kleiss . Van Kleiss ? ! What does that third-rate lab hack have to do with this ? What ? I guess I 'm not the only one who needs an update . Where have you been ? It 's a long story ... Actually , short by my clock . A splinter group had formed at the lab . They had other ideas about how the nanites would be used . We tried to stop them , and you were hurt . The only way to save your life was an infusion of nanites . It was risky , but it worked . We thought that would be enough to stop the others , make them see the right path . But ... We were wrong . Mom and dad were in the reactor . As for me , I managed to escape in my lab . But the shock wave , the same one that probably blanked your memory ... Also interfered with the engine that powers this pod . I was stuck in sub-light drive . How long ? 15 minutes . That 's how long it took me to reboot the system . But at the speed I was going , it was five years of your time . I knew there was an accident , but I had no idea how bad . My nanite sensors were off the charts . My first priority was to insure the OM-1 was safe . That was our promise . And ... Here we are . So , what have I missed these past five years ? Providence . We need to talk . They can wait . So , let me understand . They 're called evos , and Van Kleiss claims to be their leader ? Well , not for all of them ... yet . I want to know about me , about our parents . They were scientists . We lived all over the world . Things settled down when you came along . That was in Geneva . Wait a second . - Are you saying I 'm Swiss ? - Not really . Mother was born in Mexico City , father in Buenos Aires . And they 're really ... Gone ? Um , where exactly did this ship take us ? What do you know ? We 're back at the original lab site . You mean the one in Abysus ? Is that a problem ? I 'd say just a small one . We should go , like now . Huh . Must be low on charge . We may be stuck , but on the bright side , I can take a look at some of these variegated organisms . Caesar , wait ! Fascinating . We theorized mutations might occur but never anything this random . Sorry , bro , but these guys usually don 't sit still for questions . Hmm . That 's new . Guess I 've learned a ... a few tricks . But they still won 't be enough if Van Kleiss shows up with all his goons . Six ! We 're locked onto you . The keep is already on its way . Your ship may be out of juice , but I 'm not . Hop on . I can get us out of here . I won 't leave my lab , and you definitely don 't want Van Kleiss getting his hands on some of the things in here . I 'll try to reroute the capacitors to an alternate power source . Oh , you want to see a photo of you , me , and papi ? Maybe later . You 're a little off , aren 't you , Caesar ? What was that machine it flew off with ? A laboratory ... One I thought I 'd never see again . It seems an old friend has returned . Caesar . Providence isn 't so bad now , eh , hermano ? Is this a Grinnell ? They always made good consoles , except for the random power surges . Well ? Everything 's cool . He 's a little kooky , but I 'm pretty sure he 's my brother . Glad to hear it . Now I need you back . We still have some unfinished business . Got to get back to work . My little brother , the hero . I remember when you just wanted to be a musician . Guitar ? No , wait ... drums . Accordion . You got to be kidding me ! As I recall , you started it . Huh ? The evo is dividing faster than we can contain it . The city is being evacuated . Hmm . Excuse me , admiral . I need you to take me down there immediately . Afraid I 'll have to insist . Rex ! Are you crazy ? ! Depends on who you ask . I had something in my lab that I thought could help . Help ? You 're not even supposed to be outside the keep . Whoo-hoo ! Way to go , bro ! First day on the job , and you already got a save ! - Job ? - Oh , come on , admit it , Six . He just saved our chicharrones . What ? What 's so funny ? You always make me laugh when you try to speak Spanish . We 've pulled his records , and I 've confirmed his DNA . It seems Rex really does have a brother . If everything I 've read about him is true , he could be an incredible asset to Providence . Or a major liability . All the more reason to keep him with us . Give him whatever he needs . White 's right , Six . He knows more about nanites than anyone on the planet . - He helped invent them . - My point exactly . He 's settling in ? I guess so . Caesar 's a little strange . Hard to believe he 's actually my brother . I 'm happy for you , Rex . You always said you wanted to find your family . Thanks , but ... You know what ? I already did . Caesar may be my brother , but you , Holiday , Bobo , you 're who I have a connection with . Aww , now , see , I 'm getting all misty . There you are . Hmm . Nice view . Say , mijo , you think your cafeteria could whip up a pizza with pineapple and salmon ? I 've been craving one for days . Connection , huh ?

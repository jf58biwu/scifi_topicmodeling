 ANNOUNCER : Previously on Fringe : - How does she seem ? BROYLES : Like Dunham . WALTER : She 's internalized her traits . For all intents and purposes , she is our Agent Dunham . BROYLES : You 're embedding one of them on my team . - What if her new identity doesn 't hold ? - Then she will no longer be necessary . PETER : You know things about the Other Side . Things you couldn 't know unless you were from there . - Like what ? PETER : Your niece is alive . She was born and it 's her birthday today . - There 's no way to prove it . PETER : Yes , there is . WALTER : Their Olivia can travel between worlds safely . We believe you may be able to do the same . ELLA : Aunt Liv . I knew you wouldn 't forget my birthday . It didn 't work . All I saw was black . Through suffering comes redemption . Through sorrow comes exaltation . Through pitch-dark comes a cleansing fire . And through the fire we shall find the spring of new life . ( HEAVY BREATHING ) ( TAPPING ) MAX : Mommy ? Max . There 's a monster in my closet . No monsters here . None there either . Looks like your room is officially monster-free tonight , kiddo . Now , you remember what big boys do to get rid of monsters in their room ? Well , you close your eyes and you count to three . - And when we open them ? - The monster 's gone . Mm-hm . You get some rest , sweetie . I love you . ( GASPS ) One , two , three . Fringe s3e07 The Abducted .. NEWSMAN ( ON RADIO ) : Polls show that most Americans oppose the proposed law to limit the number of children to two per family . However , leading politicians from two of the three major parties ... ( DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES ) - ... favor the law ... OLIVIA : Hey . HENRY : You . What are you doing here ? Can I buy you breakfast ? Thank you . Thanks . I need to get into the DOD facility on Liberty Island . And I need your help . I can steal a boat , but I can 't leave it docked on the island . The security patrol would find it . And I need some time inside the building alone . I just need you to get me across the water . Across the patrolled water . You 're with Fringe Division . Don 't you have super-secret clearance or something ? - Why you breaking into a government ... ? - Because I have to go home . Oh , so home is on Liberty Island now ? It doesn 't matter where I 'm from . What matters ... What matters is that I 'm in trouble . I think my time is running out here . And right now you are the only person that I am willing to trust . I need your help , Henry . Please , will you help me ? ( SIGHS ) So if all you 're asking for is a ride you ain 't gotta steal a boat . My cousin has one . Just give me a day or so . - Thank you . - Yeah . ( PAGER BEEPS ) Okay , there 's my number . I gotta go . Hey , those people you were running away from , they still after you ? Not if they keep believing that I 'm somebody else , no . Thanks . CHARLIE : We 'll let you know if Fringe Division officially assumes the case . Thanks . Appreciate it . So , what do we have ? Kid was abducted from his bedroom last night . Okay . We 're good down here . Molecular cohesion intact . Atmosphere readings are solid . These kidnappings are tragic but 99 percent of them have nothing to do with Fringe Division . Yeah , tell that to the secretary . Peter Bishop Act of ' 91 says kidnapping is treated like a possible Fringe event . I 'm saying that these cops don 't need us to work their cases . Waste of manpower . ( EMILY SOBBING ) It 's not a waste . I 'll get a statement . Let 's check upstairs . COP 1 : Davidson , he 's taking statements up and down the street . COP 2 : Okay . Detective , would you mind walking us through the scene ? Sure . Uh , Victim is Max Clayton , 8 years old . Mom came to check on him in the morning and he was gone . We , uh , found a couple of partial prints on the windowsill and in the closet but we are still collecting evidence . We believe the suspect snatched the kid and he , uh , fled out the window . Well , it 's a long way down , especially carrying a 50-pound kid . Okay . So the suspect is probably male , strong , uh , say , 20 to 35 . - Hey , can I see that for a second ? - Yeah . Some kind of residue on these fingerprints . - Sucrose . DETECTIVE : Sugar ? What , was he eating cookies or something ? Secretes it through his sweat . It 's the Candy Man . He 's back . ( DOOR OPENS ) - Mr. Secretary . - I just heard . Fringe Division was created to investigate tragedies of an unimaginable scale . You and I both know that there is no crime more heinous than the theft of a child . I 'll do everything I can to find him , sir . I don 't doubt your resolve , Phillip . Actually , that 's why I 'm here . There 's no shame in letting it fall to another desk if it 's too personal . It 's been four years since the Candy Man took my son . Four years since I heard him laugh or watched him play outside with his sister . He had my son for two days . When I got him back , he wasn 't a little boy anymore . If there 's anyone you want on this case it 's me . Very well . My only concern is that I don 't have all my agents to help me . How long until this is over , sir ? Until our Olivia comes home ? You 'll be happy to know we made a breakthrough . We found something in her brain chemistry . Something unique . If it 's what enables her to cross between worlds you 'll have your team back very soon . I know what it 's like to lose a son . And even when they come back , the damage is irreparable . If you need someone to talk to , Phillip , let me know . We need a lead , folks . Something to go on . It 's been 18 hours since the Clayton boy went missing . That gives us until tomorrow night to find him . LINCOLN : Candy Man 's last kidnapping was two years ago . It was before you joined Fringe Division . I remember when this happened , reading about it . The papers never said what he did to the kids . It 's like they 've had the life drained out of them . Acute deterioration of organ tissue , depleted immune systems . Some of the kids even came back with cancer . Those incisions . Why there ? LINCOLN : Posterior cerebral cortex . From that point , you could access the spine . Okay . Astrid , what do we know about these cases ? The abductions themselves appear to be random , occurring every two years . The victims are always children , ages 7 through 9 . They 're taken , then released 48 hours later with massive internal degradation . The victims described the suspect as male , age unknown . The majority of cases , other than a shaved head , there 's no description . - He wore a mask . - What do you mean , " majority of cases " ? Two of the victims reported being held captive by two suspects . One young and one old . Then why haven 't we expanded the profile to look for two suspects ? Liv , these kids were really scared . There 's a lot of inconsistencies in their statements . That doesn 't mean that they 're not true . Can you please pull up the victims ' bios ? Okay , Amanda Holt and Christopher Broyles . - We should speak to Christopher again . - It 's not a good idea , Liv . You weren 't here when it happened . Broyles is protective . - Well , we should at least ask . - Liv , don 't even think about it . I would like to re-interview your son . Excuse me ? Christopher reported that he was held by two men . An older man and a younger man . He may remember other things about this guy that could help our investigation . Agent Dunham . My son went through something no child should ever have to go through . And when he came home , I had to ask him questions about it . Going over the details again and again forcing him to relive it when all he wanted to do was forget . And for what ? I didn 't solve the case . And I didn 't help my little boy sleep at night . I 'm sure that you did your best . But if I spoke to him , maybe I could get more out of him . I 'm his father . Perhaps that 's the problem . Maybe there are some things that you don 't wanna hear . Now there 's something I want you to hear . My son 's condition since he was taken has deteriorated so rapidly that he 'll be lucky if he makes it to his 18th birthday . Now , what little childhood Christopher has left , I intend to protect it . I get that . But Christopher 's childhood is not the only one at stake right now . You 're dismissed . ( CREAKING ) I don 't feel good . I wanna go home . CANDY MAN : Through suffering comes redemption . Through sorrow comes exaltation . Through the pitch-dark comes the cleansing fire and through the fire we shall find the spring of new life . NARRATOR ( ON RADIO ) : Devotes his life to righting wrongs , protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . Cranston is known to the underworld as the Shadow . Never seen , only heard his true identity is known only to his constant friend and aid , Margot Lane . Today 's story ... - Hey . - Hey . There 's been a police officer parked out front all afternoon . So it 's true ? The Candy Man 's back ? Yeah . ( CLEARS THROAT ) Do you think he 'll try to come back here ? No . It 's just for my peace of mind . How 's Christopher ? He 's scared . The story about the missing boy has been all over the news today . Did you eat ? Not since breakfast . Has there been any progress in the case ? No . One of my agents wanted to re-interview Chris . Olivia Dunham . She thinks there may be some detail he 's forgotten . I told her it was a waste of time . I 've always liked Olivia . She seems very smart . I 'm gonna go put him to bed . He 's a strong boy , Phillip . Strong enough to talk about it . Even if you 're not . Thought you might be hungry too . - Red Vines . - They 're new . Charlie tried them . He said they 're great . Thanks . So after the victims were abducted , the kids came back with massive cell degeneration and internal-organ atrophy . All those conditions are symptomatic of old age , too , right ? I suppose so . Why ? Well , aging has to do with the pituitary gland which can be accessed through the back of the neck . Did you suddenly become a scientist when I was in the hospital ? - Trying to take my job ? - It was an old case I worked before I joined Fringe . This guy was draining hormones from pituitary glands . Anyway , my point is that some of the victims mentioned there were two suspects , one old and one young . But they all said that they never saw the suspects at the same time . - Okay . - Well , what if there weren 't two people ? What if there was only one person who was literally changing from old to young ? What if the Candy Man is stealing youth ? ( CHUCKLES ) Okay . In theory , concentrated pituitary hormones could be processed in some way to accelerate healing maybe even reverse aging . If that 's true , it would also cause some serious side effects . - Like what ? - Anemia . - Tremors . Hyperglycemia . - High blood sugar ? High enough that he could secrete sugar in his sweat ? ( PHONE BEEPS ) This is Dunham . Okay , I 'll be there . Thank you . LINCOLN : What was that about ? It 's nice to see you again , Olivia . Chris is looking forward to meeting you . ( SIGHS ) DIANE : Through here . BROYLES : Chris , Agent Dunham is here . Oh , uh , Olivia is fine . - It 's nice to meet you , Chris . - Hi . OLIVIA : Hi . Did you really save that school bus of kids from a Class 3 vortex last year ? Is it true ? Well , I was just doing my job . ( CHRISTOPHER CHUCKLES ) That 's so cool . So my mom says you wanna talk about the man who took me . Yeah . Would that be okay ? Sure . OLIVIA : Maybe we could talk somewhere else . Like , where is your favorite place to go ? ( PHONE BEEPS ) - Broyles . WALTER : The Candy Man 's had the boy for 36 hours . Twelve hours left . How are we doing ? Nothing yet . But we 're working every lead we have . WALTER : You 'll be happy to hear you 'll have your team back soon . Olivia 's mission on the Other Side is almost complete . - We 'll be able to bring her home . - What about this Olivia ? We 're gonna pull her out of the field tomorrow morning . I don 't believe we 'll be needing her anymore . Call me if you find anything . My dad says I need to forget about what happened . Yeah ? Ooh , but it 's hard to forget , isn 't it ? You know , I can imagine what it must have been like for you . Like how scared you must have been how much you would 've wanted to get back to your family and to your friends . I have nightmares about this sometimes . Really ? Could you tell me about them ? I always remember the smell first . It 's musty like our attic . He comes to the room wearing a mask to check on the thing stuck in my neck . It feels like it 's stealing my energy . I 'm so tired . I feel sick . Chris you said that there were two men . One old and one young , right ? Did they ever talk to you ? No . Nothing I remember . Chris . What is it ? You can tell me . I know the Candy Man 's back . OLIVIA : Yeah , he is . He said if I told anyone about him , he 'd come back . ( SOBBING ) He said this time he 'd hurt my mom and dad . That is not going to happen . I promise . Christopher , there 's another little boy just like you . He 's been taken . And he wants to go home and see his family too . You can help him . I remember their voices . Um , they both said the same thing . Think it was a prayer . Can you remember the words ? Some of the words . " Through the pitch-dark comes a cleansing fire . " Okay . CHARLIE : " Through the pitch-dark comes a cleansing fire . " The words " pitch " and " dark " are common to several prayers from the early 20th century . The words appear in the liturgy ... - ... of over a dozen churches in New York . - A dozen that we know of . Every time there 's a Fringe event , a new church pops up . Thought it was bad enough someone 's kidnapping kids . Now we find out he 's kidnapping kids for God . - Hi , honey . CHRISTOPHER : Mom . I collected some shells for you . - They smell like the ocean . - Thank you . Oh . Looks like you brought half the beach back with you too . No , leave the sand . I like it . I 'll be right in . Broyles . He was very , very helpful . - Thank you . - Thank you . - Come on , I wanna wash the shells off . - Okay . - Bye , Christopher . - Bye . - Dunham . HENRY : The boat 's called Sally . The Redhook Marina in Brooklyn . B Dock . Be there tonight at 10 and I 'll get you where you wanna go . - Okay , I 'll be there . BROYLES : Dunham . Charlie got a hit on the prayer . They traced it to the Astoria Church in Queens . " Through the pitch-dark comes the cleansing fire . " Yeah . " And through the fire we shall find the spring of new life . " It 's beautiful , isn 't it ? What does it mean ? I wasn 't always a man of the cloth , you know . I used to be a physician . And then the avian influenza epidemic came and my wife became ill . And despite all my training , there was ... There was nothing I could do to save her . Without her I was nothing . I was lost . But then God came and lifted me up . And he showed me that what people need in these troubled times is something to believe in . Faith . That 's what will heal this wounded world . The prayer was spoken by the suspect in a kidnapping that we 're investigating . We believe the suspect is a member of your church . It will help our investigation if you would give the names and addresses of all the men in your congregation . Giving out information on parishioners is breaking the confessional seal . Reverend Marcus , I understand . I , too , am a man of faith . But right now there 's a child missing . We need your help . We have a former victim who can identify the kidnappers ' voices . You believe that this person is reliable ? He 's my son . Oh , I 'm sorry . I can get you the roster from our men 's group if that 'll help . Thank you . - There are over 40 names on this list . - We 'll have to split up . Call Lincoln and Charlie . OLIVIA : Nope , nothing yet . Although this church is full of true believers . One guy actually told me that the reverend cured his kidney disease . So , what about Charlie and Lincoln ? BROYLES : They 've interviewed seven men on the list and none of them fit the profile . Okay , I 'm here . I 'll , uh , call you in a bit . Wyatt Toomy ? Agent Dunham . I 'm with Fringe Division . I need to ask you a couple questions in regard to an investigation . - Can I come in ? - Sure . WYATT : Yeah , saw him on the news . It 's real sad . Do you really think someone from the church may have taken him ? Possibly , yeah . Excuse me for a moment . - So did you meet Reverend Marcus ? - Yes . Oh . He is a miracle worker . Great man . Touched by God . Do you live here alone , Mr. Toomy ? Yep . Just me . Don 't move ! This is Agent Dunham . I 'm at 1068 Kent Street , Apartment 5 . The suspect 's been sighted . I need backup now , please . Max , hi . Uh , I 'm with the FBI . Are you okay ? Okay . Oh . ( THUD ) Hey . You okay ? You sure ? All right . Okay . Okay . OLIVIA : The paramedics took Max to the hospital . His mother is gonna meet him there . The super said that Wyatt Toomy had been living here for almost nine years . He kept to himself . Always paid his rent a week in advance . Hey , you guys should take a look at this . Have you figured out what he was doing ? I won 't know exactly until we get this back to the lab but my guess is Olivia was right . About what ? Seems he was making some kind of age-regression serum . He was extracting hormones from the kids and giving them to himself . Your son was right . There was a young and an old suspect . It 's just they were the same man . This guy worked in sanitation . How did he figure out how to do all this ? All right , let 's bag and tag it . I won 't forget what you did here . Hey . When you 're done here , you wanna join me and Charlie for a beer ? We get a lot of bad days . Gotta celebrate the good ones . Ha , ha . No , thanks . I 'm going home . OLIVIA : Hey . - You 're 19 minutes late . One more minute and I was out of here . Wow . You think this thing is gonna take us across the harbor ? Don 't worry about the boat . Worry about the patrols around that island . Hey , Henry . I know I 'm asking a lot of you . - If you want to back out ... - Come on , let 's get it over with . - You want me to cast us off ? - What ? Do you want me to untie the boat from the dock ? Oh , yeah , yeah . Do that . Yeah . Henry , you have done this before , right ? - Wanna know the truth ? OLIVIA : Yeah . Water scares the hell out of me . Don 't worry . My cousin ran me through everything I need to know . We 'll be fine . Just do that casting thing . What 's wrong ? Someone had to teach you how to do it . Yeah . So what ? I told you I 'm not a boater . Hey , hon . When you hear this , give me a call . I shouldn 't be here too much longer . - Hey , I just left you a message . - Hey , uh , I think we were wrong . Wyatt Toomy was not a scientist . He needed someone to show him how to make the serum . - Who ? - Reverend Marcus . He said he was a doctor . That 's how he 's healing his congregation . He 's been dosing them . Wyatt was working for him . - Dear God . - Christopher was right all along . There really were two suspects . I told Reverend Marcus Chris could ID the voices . - Now my wife isn 't picking up the phone . - I 'll meet you at your house . Henry , I gotta go do something . Can you promise me you 'll wait for me ? Please . Where the hell are you going ? ( DIANE SCREAMS ) ( GASPS ) ( MUFFLED SCREAMING ) ( FOOTSTEPS ) You wanna play hide and seek , young man ? I 'll find you . God wants me to find you . I 'm simply carrying out his plan . Take comfort , Christopher . You gave so much of yourself to help heal others . We all have to make sacrifices for the common good . CHRISTOPHER : No , no , no , no . No . - No ! Let go of me ! BROYLES : Hey ! Chris . Dad . You 're safe , son . You 're okay now . HENRY : Where are you ? It 's been an hour . What 's the deal ? OLIVIA : I 'M leaving now . Give me 15 minutes . Make it fast . I 'm starting to get seasick . Agent Dunham ? I thought that was you . Mrs. Clayton . How is Max doing ? Doctors think you got there just in time . You know , he hasn 't been able to stop talking about you . It 'd really mean a lot if you could say hi . - Hey , Max . Someone 's here to see you . - Hi . Hi . How are you feeling ? - Much better now . - That 's good . You 're a real brave kid . You know that ? Well , not as brave as you . Can I ask you a question ? - Sure . - What 's FBI ? FBI ? Where did you hear that ? Well , you said it when you saved me , remember ? You said you were FBI . Oh . Well , FBI is just another word for " police . " Well , then when I grow up , I want to be FBI too . ( CHUCKLES ) That would be nice . Now you should get some rest , because it 's late . Okay . ( BROYLES CLEARS THROAT ) - Bye . - Bye . - How 's your wife and son ? - They 're gonna be fine . The doctors are gonna take a look at the serum Wyatt Toomy was synthesizing . It may have some healing potential for Christopher and the victims . Great . Maybe some good could come out of all this . Dunham . The FBI ceased to exist over a decade ago . At least on this side , it did . You know who you are , don 't you ? What happens now ? Now I 'm going home . Henry , don 't worry . Stick to the same bearings on your way out and you won 't run into patrols . What makes you so sure ? Because I memorized their routes when I escaped from there . How you plan on getting up there ? OLIVIA : I 'll manage . Thank you for everything . - Hey , I just borrowed a boat . - No . You believed in me . You got me all the way the hell out here . You might as well tell me , where is it you 're from ? I 'm from a parallel universe . GUARD : Copy that . - Yes ? MAN : Sir , there 's been a security breach . Someone 's accessed the lab on Liberty Island . CLEANING LADY : Ma 'am , what are you ... ? We 're closed . ( CHUCKLES ) I 'm sorry , I was just , uh ... Would you be able to let me out ? No , no . Please . This can 't be happening . Okay . I 'm not gonna hurt you . I need you to listen very carefully . What I 'm gonna say is gonna sound insane . But I need you to do something for me . No ! No ! No ! ( OLIVIA GASPING ) Please . Please , I don 't belong here . - Sedate her . OLIVIA : Oh , God . Please , let me go . Who are you really and what were you before ? What did you do and what did you think , huh ? We said no questions . PETER : I can turn it off if you wanna go to sleep . - I 'm just resting my eyes . - Right . Otherwise known as sleeping . Oh , don 't you wanna see how it ends ? I 've seen this movie about a hundred times . You 're honestly telling me you 've never seen Casablanca ? I 've heard of it . It 's , uh , Ronald Reagan , right ? ( CHUCKLES ) No . It 's Humphrey Bogart . Oh . I was kidding . Okay , so let me guess . They , uh , end up running away together ... - ... and they live happily ever after . - Actually , no . She leaves him at the airport and they never see each other again . Oh . I thought you said it was a love story . Well , aren 't all the best love stories tragedies ? Only in the movies . Come on , let 's go to sleep . - Good night . - Good night . WOMAN ( ON TV ) : Well , that 's easy . ( BUZZES ) PETER : Oh , you gotta be kidding me . Hello ? Walter , is that you ? I can hear you breathing . CLEANING LADY ( ON PHONE ) : Is this Peter Bishop ? - Yes . - I 'M calling from New York . I know this is gonna sound crazy but I just saw a woman disappear in front of my eyes . - Who is this ? - Her name was Olivia . She has a message for you . She 's trapped in the Other Universe .

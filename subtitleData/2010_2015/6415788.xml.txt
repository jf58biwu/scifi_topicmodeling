 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... So , Garrett says your family 's like the cable version of the Kennedys . My older brother , Christian , he didn 't beat up my younger brother . He was crueler than that . He made me do it . - Welcome home , Agent Simmons . - Hi , Fitz . - Is that really you ? - Who else would it be ? Anyone mind telling me what the bloody hell she 's doing here ? Bobbi 's one of our best agents . Hunter ever tell you stories about his she-devil ex-wife ? All the time . - Damn . - I 've got a senator with very deep pockets that wants Coulson . Your father is alive . And someday , if you let me , I 'll take you to him . 2x06 - " A Fractured House " I was here in 2012 when the sky tore open and the Chitauri rained down on us . Aliens . Aliens were running through the streets , and it was then that S.H.I.E.L.D. revealed themselves and stood with the Avengers , leading us to believe that we could put our faith in them , which we did . We stood idly by while they collected super-powered individuals , garnered alien weapons , built bases on virtually every continent . We thought S.H.I.E.L.D. was protecting us , but in truth , they took advantage of our good faith , and they still are . Italy takes note of your report , general . Now , you say that you 've seen S.H.I.E.L.D. , even fought against them . But where is the proof ? Where is ... Aah ! Che diavolo ! Help ! Help me ! S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s here ! Go ! Freeze ! Go to the exit in the corner . Go ! Come here . S.H.I.E.L.D. is done hiding . 5 : 30 on the dot every morning . But there 's no clock , no light , no way he can know what time it is . You 've been watching him ? Every day before I left , every day since I got back . I don 't know how you do it , going down there , talking to him . Sacrifices we make for valuable intel , right ? - Yeah . - Jemma Simmons undercover at HYDRA . I thought I was a dead woman at least four times . - I 'm glad you 're not . - Me too . - Be careful with him , Skye . - I am . What 's happening ? There 's been an attack on the U.N. An attack today of the U.N. left six dead and dozens injured . Among the injured , S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s biggest opponent , U.S. air force Brigadier General Glenn Talbot . - Sir , this wasn 't us , was it ? - No , this is HYDRA looking for revenge . Best guess ... Daniel Whitehall had his people impersonate S.H.I.E.L.D. to put the world 's attention back on us . - So much for staying in the shadows . - Somebody bring this from home ? I want you two scouring government channels , - see what we 're up against . - On it , sir . And , Skye , this means the alien writing ... - Back burner . - Just until we get this under control . Just saw the news . We 're not responsible for this , are we , sir ? Didn 't think so . Just wanted to triple-check . Marcus Scarlotti was behind the attack . An assassin ... almost killed Barton a few years back . Runs a team of mercenaries ... mostly for HYDRA . Ah . The bodies just disintegrate . I saw references to this weapon in HYDRA 's lab . Yeah , sent from their demolitions expert , - uh , Toshiro ... - Toshiro Mori . I 've crossed paths with him before . He has a lab in Okinawa . Good . Then that 's where you 're going . We need to find the location of the next attack and stop it before it happens . May 's taking point on this op . You can meet her and Hunter in the hangar . Hunter 's going ? Got it . Thank you , sir . I need you to dig through the hard drive you brought back from Whitehall 's lab . I 'll find out whatever I can about those weapons . - Coulson , quick question . - No , this wasn 't us . Oh , tha ... uh , great . Um ... May said I 'd be going on a mission with Bobbi ? Is that gonna be a problem ? Did she say it was gonna be a problem ? - I won 't dignify that with a response . - So ... she ... didn 't ? I think we all know how you feel about your ex-wife , but if it 's too complicated , then by all means . Whitehall 's on the attack . And instead of using his own forces to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. , he 's having the rest of the world do it for him . - You 're lucky to be alive , general . - My lucky day . It was my understanding that you had S.H.I.E.L.D. under control . Otherwise , I don 't know why I persuaded the armed services committee to give your unit such extraordinary funding . Because it worked ... until this morning . I don 't think anything before today matters now , does it ? S.H.I.E.L.D. attacked the United Nations , for God 's sake , under your watch . The people who attacked us may not have been S.H.I.E.L.D. It 's time I step in . - And do what ? - Control the situation . Now that S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s back in the spotlight , the press is gonna take this and run with it . You 're worried they 're gonna find out about your brother , aren 't you ? What worries me is that you even know about him . I don 't play politics , senator . I haven 't said one word about your brother to anyone , and I don 't intend to . The truth is , general , you can 't assure me of anything . It time I do what I should 've done months ago ... put S.H.I.E.L.D. in the ground for good . S.H.I.E.L.D. is a terrorist organization , and they should be treated as such . Is that what you plan to speak about at the U.N. ' s emergency session tomorrow ? What I plan to do is lay out a proposal for a multi-national police force that will target those suspected of ties with S.H.I.E.L.D. - Using any and all means necessary . - Anyone suspected of ties ? And who determines that ? Belgium will never accept this proposal . It destroys the very idea of citizens ' rights . Mr. Beckers , if you want to welcome S.H.I.E.L.D. at your borders with open arms , be my guest , but this infestation needs to be exterminated . Guess being a douche-bag runs in the family . Are you surprised ? Ward 's brother never cared about S.H.I.E.L.D. before . - Not openly . - Yeah , but Hunter said that Talbot was working with a senator who had deep pockets . - You think it 's him ? - I do . Months rebuilding , and this is S.H.I.E.L.D. Few operatives here , not many more out there . - If Senator Ward 's proposal passes ... - It 'll be a witch-hunt . Every military organization on the planet will have a license to kick our operatives ' doors down and shoot them on the spot . I can 't let that happen . I 'll talk to Ward , see if he has any intel on his brother . And , Skye ... keep the focus on his family , not yours . - Agent Walters . - Director . How 's the Netherlands ? Same as always , sir . Lots of bikes , lots of weed . I assume this is about the anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. proposal ? We can 't take any chances . Send out the word to your team . Go dark . Seek refuge . - Reestablish contact in 24 hours . - Copy that , sir . And , Agent Walters , stay safe . You look good . Oh , yeah ? Cheers . And , you know , with the ... blond and everything , - you don 't look too bad yourself . - It 's nice of you to say . Because I heard you 've been telling people I 'm a hell beast . Uh ... no , I d ... I don 't think so . I definitely didn 't use those words specifically . That doesn 't even sound like something I 'd say , really . So , you vouched for me , knew I was with S.H.I.E.L.D. the whole time ? I 'm honestly surprised you stayed this long . Well , you know , I 'm here for now , - but keeping my options open , obviously . - You always do . If we 're gonna do this now , at least let me grab a beer first . I 'm gonna go check on May . - We 'll be touching down soon . - Okay . You ever been married ? Still talk to him ? Right . Good advice . Morning , Fitz . Hey . Is that the , uh ... hard drive that you stole ? Coulson asked me to search it for anything related to the attacks . Um , I was hoping you could help . That is , if you 're not too ... I mean ... Yeah , um , if you need m-my help , I suppose I 've got some time . Well , unfortunately , the drive was damaged during our escape . We 'll have to repair it to access any of its i-intel . - What ? - Just , um ... - You look different . That 's all . - Oh . Not " bad " different . Just ... Okay ... uh ... we probably need to first look at the , uh ... The shock sensor . - Um , no , the , um ... - Voice actuator ? - No , um , Jemma , can you ... - I 'm ... I 'm sorry . I know . It 's just you said you needed my help . No , I do . Yeah , of course I do . It 's the ... micro , uh ... this thing here . Oh , yeah . I see . I ... see that . We need to talk about your brother . - Which one ? - Your older brother ... the senator . Christian . Why ? - What happened ? - Just need basic information ... habits , places he frequently visits ... stuff like that . You need to stay away from him . He 's not what he seems . He always has an angle , and if he thinks that you can lead him to me ... - This isn 't about you . - Isn 't it ? Don 't you remember what happened at the well , what he made me do ? He gets joy from one thing ... hurting people . So , tell me , please . Does he know I 'm here ? Not how it works , Ward . You answer my questions , remember ? And I always do . I always tell you the truth , But if Christian knows that I 'm here ... - You always tell me the truth ? - Yes . I promised you I 'd never lie to you , and I haven 't . What 's this ... really about ? I need information about your brother ... - people , connections . - Is this about your father ? 'Cause I wasn 't lying about him . - He 's alive , and he 's ... - He 's a murderer . You forgot to mention that detail . You found him . He didn 't give us what we needed on his brother . Trust me . He gave us more than you think . And you 're slipping off track , Skye . Stay on-mission . Toshiro has the weapons from the U.N. attack , so we have two options ... one ... firefight . Surprise them , take down as many as we can before they bring out heavy artillery . And option two ? Just to hear it . I use my HYDRA cover ... a cover that could be blown . - That 's why I like option one . - On the other hand , I know Toshiro . The best way to get him to leak intel is to get him bragging . I think it 's worth the risk . She can handle it . Deception 's her forte . Uh , I-I mean that sincerely , not passive-aggressively . As in , it 's a good attribute for a spy to ... Bloody hell . You can go in , but if anything 's off , we 're coming after you . They 'll search you for weapons . Don 't die out there , all right ? Data intercept 's up and running . We have audio and visual from the security cameras and access to any incoming cellular communications . Toshiro-san . _ - She speaks Japanese ? - She has this annoying knack for picking things up very quickly . _ _ _ _ No . Still like option two ? Do you still have that pan-fired green tea ? It 's from the Shizuoka prefecture , right ? You always remember every little detail . Try being married to somebody who remembers every little detail . It 's not that charming . You think I 'm being petty , don 't you ? Well , I 'm not . I don 't have a problem with Bob kissing that guy . Good . Because you had a hickey on your neck for a week after our mission in Miami . Excuse me for doing my job thoroughly ... and with style . The tea needs to steep for at least seven minutes . Mm . Perfect time for us to talk business , then . Forgive me , but I 'd like to clear something up first . You see , there 's a nasty rumor going around that you are actually working for S.H.I.E.L.D. Toshi , please . Aren 't we all working for S.H.I.E.L.D. ? Didn 't you see the papers this morning ? Scarlotti and his team were on the front page with that silly eagle on their chests . But those weapons they had ... your work , I presume ? How could you tell ? This poor sap 's buying every word she says . - That 's what we want . - I just feel sorry for the guy . Making targets feel special ... that 's her thing . You know , when I gave her my nan 's pearl earrings , - she was like ... - You know I don 't like you , right ? I call them splinter bombs . Has a nice ring to it , doesn 't it ? Is there any way for me to get my hands on a splinter bomb ? Those really are a thing of beauty . Unfortunately , I shipped them all out yesterday . Plus , I can 't take all the credit . Original specs came from HYDRA technology way back when . - Whitehall gave them to you ? - Yes . A leap of faith . I just hope I 've earned a chance to work on the Diviner . The Diviner ? That 's what the lunatic who brought it to him calls it , anyway . I heard it 's alien . - You don 't think he means ... - The Obelisk . Toshiro 's people have an incoming message . - Oh , no . - What ? All I know is that I have a better case to make once Scarlotti 's team gets to Beckers . Then S.H.I.E.L.D. will be dead in the water . They 're en route to Beckers now ? You can thank me later . Thank you ? What the hell were you thinking ? What was I thinking ? I just saved your life . You don 't think I knew that guy was behind me ? This ... this is just you peacocking . He made you , and he was gonna kill you ! And , sweetheart , nobody uses the word " peacocking . " Are you even listening to yourself right now ? Oh , wait . Of course you are . You love the sound of your own voice . Because it 's reasonable . One of us has to be . This is what makes you so aggravating to be with . Hence , not with me anymore . Lucky us . - Yes . - Really ? I just saved her life twice , and this is the thanks I get . Toshiro said that they were going after Beckers . Recognize the name ? Yeah , Julien Beckers , Belgian foreign affairs minister . The guy who 's been keeping the peace ? If Scarlotti 's team takes out Beckers , even the neutral U.N. countries are gonna fall in line with Senator Ward 's proposal . Call Coulson . We 're heading to Belgium . Bad day to be S.H.I.E.L.D. , eh ? I still can 't find anything on the weapons . Fitz ? Ah , you 're still looking at those backlogged files . Yeah . That 's because , um ... those ... these two bits , there 's something . - I think the ... - A similar alloy ? No , no . No . Um , no . It 's ... um ... it 's important , because ... I ... the ... Can you stop , uh ... stop looking at me ? Oh , I can 't even look at you now . - No , not like that , you can 't . - Like what ? I 'm ... I 'm trying not to treat you any differently than ... I know , but I am different . And I ... and I 'm ... I 'm trying not to be , but I am . And if for some reason you can 't accept it ... Oh , that 's not fair . - Fitz , I 'm only trying to help . - You left . I needed help . I needed help with the cloaking . I needed help with , um ... with lots of other things , and someone to talk through , at least . - You gave up on me . - I did no such thing . You told me you were gonna go see your mum and your dad , and then you went off to ... for all I ... for all I know , you could ... something could 've ... you could 've been killed . And because what ? Because you think I 'm useless ? Of course I don 't . That 's not why I left . Well , then , why ? Fitz ... I 'm sorry . I can 't do this . Excuse me . Excuse me . What are you doing here ? Don 't worry . I haven 't been waiting long . Phil Coulson . I assume these are for your speech . I made a few changes . It 's funnier now . I 'm sure Talbot 's mentioned me from time to time , which is perhaps why you 're trying to call whomever it is you 're trying to call . Also , your men won 't be checking on you ... at least not for the next hour . You 've requested some " me " time . And who can argue with that ? - What do you want ? - An opportunity to clear the air . The attack on the U.N. wasn 't S.H.I.E.L.D. , it was HYDRA ... specifically , a man named Daniel Whitehall . You didn 't come here to clear the air . You need something from me . And all this swaggering simply tells me you have nothing to offer in return . What do you want me to do ? Go on record defending S.H.I.E.L.D. , condemning HYDRA ? The american people are looking for a simple enemy , Mr. Coulson . It 's what makes them feel safe . And how do they think they 'd feel if they knew your brother was HYDRA ? That 's an awfully complicated idea to grasp , especially in an election year . - Are you threatening me , Mr. Coulson ? - No . I 'm telling you I have your brother in my basement . You 're back . Camera 's off . - Does Coulson know that ... - Coulson 's out . He cut us off last time , but now nobody 's watching . Just you and me . Is he all right ? Is Grant hurt ? Did ... did you have to do anything ... No . We believe there are other ways to get information from people . I 'm surprised you 're concerned , honestly . - You don 't have a brother , do you ? - No . Always wanted one , though . As an only child , you tend to idealize that relationship . Family has to take care of each other , right ? Then again ... I 've heard some stories that say otherwise . - What did Grant tell you ? - Plenty . I know what you did . How you forced him to torture your youngest brother . I know what happened at the well . So , it 's a well now ? You may think you know Grant Ward , Mr. Coulson , but trust me ... underneath every lie he tells is just another lie . Is Coulson talking to Christian ? You can 't trust him . He 'll smile , bare his soul . It is all manipulation . He is a master at it . Look , I know what I am . But my brother ... he 's worse . When we were kids , our parents were always gone ... some state function or another . We 'd spend all day by the creek hunting salamanders and crayfish . But I could never leave Grant alone with Thomas . I found Grant down there once , standing over him with a screwdriver . Thomas was on the ground , just screaming . And I saw something ... something else behind his eyes . Something I 'm sure you 've seen before , as well . A second later , it was gone , and he was just my little brother again . He told our parents I forced him to do it . I 've spent too much of my life trying to unravel his lies . - So have I. - And yet , he keeps telling them . He always finds someone to believe him . I 'm telling you the truth . You see that now , don 't you ? I never lied about your father . You just didn 't give me the chance to tell you ... I know . But I 'm giving you the chance now . And I want to know everything . He won 't get away with it this time . It 's not going to be simple but I think I know a way we can both have what we want . Your father killed people , yes . But everything he did , Skye , he did because he loved you . I can 't fault him for that . The people who died in the Hunan province , they weren 't villagers . They were HYDRA agents . - They 'd found you and your mother . - My mother ? - Is she alive , too ? - No . No , they killed her . - Why ? - I don 't know . But when your father got there , he lost it , tore up the whole village and everyone in it . How ? What is he ? Whatever he is , he lost his whole family in one day , and he cracked . But now he wants to put that family back together . I can help with that . - I can take you to him . - How ? - Where is he ? - I 've got connections . - People I can talk to will track him ... - What connections ? What people ? Raina 's gone . I 'm resourceful . Then tell me what you know . Isn 't there anything else ? - Please , Ward . - No . But we can find him together . I promise you . Thank you for telling me everything you know . It 's time we get you out of here . - Really ? - Really . You 're being transferred , Ward . Your brother wants you in his custody , and we 're gonna give him exactly what he wants . I struck a deal with the senator . He 'll reverse his anti-S.H.I.E.L.D. proposal - in exchange for his brother . - Long time coming . - And Skye ? - I got everything I needed . Good . We 'll touch down in Belgium soon ... Try to get to Beckers before Whitehall 's team does . I don 't have to remind you that if he 's killed , the U.N. will come after us no matter what the senator says or does . We 'll be in touch . We got Beckers ' location . Yes , theoretically , all those points have to be connected . Damn , Fitz . You 're right . You 're right . Ah . - Why do you look so surprised ? - Well ... Well , yeah . Well , I 'd probably be surprised ... Hey , Simmons . The explosives ... Mack was just ... he saw the , um ... Yeah , he kept mentioning backlogged files , and , you know , half the stuff he says is nonsense . - No , it 's not . - Check this out . It turns out these bombs are actually from the 1940s , and they were developed by a HYDRA scientist - that worked for the Red Skull . - The Red Skull . Not nonsense , and designer . Yeah , and the actual designer of the bombs is a guy named ... Vincent Beckers . Vincent Beckers . We need to find Coulson ... now . Listen to me . - You can 't trust him . - Three and a half weeks . I sat in this chair every day for three and a half weeks , and you never said a word . But now you want to talk ? Well , it 's too late . Everything I told Skye was true . You know that . I haven 't given you one bad piece of intel . - Is that worth nothing ? - You will never see Skye again . I thought we were rebuilding trust , Coulson . I can help you . - I 'm still a part of your team . - My team ? You th ... You are not nor you 'll ever be on my team . You dropped Fitz-Simmons out of a plane . You murdered Victoria Hand and Eric Koenig . You betrayed every one of us , you deluded son of a bitch . The only reason you 're alive is because you were of use . And the only reason you 're being transferred is because your brother is of more use . Was this his idea or yours ... to put me on trial ? Hmm ? It 's a good story ... a man brave enough to have his own brother executed for his crimes . Oh , Christian will milk that for all it 's worth . And the trial should wrap up right before the midterms . Your brother saw the same angles . Maybe you two are more alike than you think . Sir , we need you . Vincent Beckers is Julien 's grandfather . We believe the HYDRA connection stayed very much alive . We found the travel records for Beckers and Whitehall , and ... They coincided at least 12 times over the past five years . That doesn 't make sense . Yeah , why would HYDRA be targeting one of their own operatives ? We 've been played . Get May on the line . They need to reroute to our safe house in Bruges . Mr. Beckers . We have agents looking for you . - How did you find this place ? - I followed them here . - Sir , May 's team 's en route . - Oh , no . Whitehall didn 't just want to turn the world against us . He used Beckers as a prop to make our operatives believe his country would provide safe haven , but it 's a trap . They 'll be fish in a barrel . What the hell did you do ? Mr. Scarlotti , I 'll leave you to what you do best . Shame . I prefer to take my time . HYDRA will never defeat ... You were saying ? Whoa , whoa , whoa . Hail HYDRA , guys . Hail HYDRA . I 'm unarmed . I 'm not looking for any trouble . Who sent you ? Have you tried the beer around here ? This is from Straffe Hendrik , little brewery around the corner . Ask for Zoe . She 'll hook you up . Here , sweetheart , you can have the first one . Looks like you could use it . - That face ... so dour . - You got 10 seconds to tell me exactly what you 're doing here . I 'm a Merc , mate , like you lot . And if you 're looking to take out a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents higher up the food chain , I happen to know a couple . They just need about ... - 90 seconds to get in position . - Huh ? I got him . Look out ! All alone ? Bobbi ! Bob ! Third time today . - What ? - You saved my life . May ... how many ? Okay . Get home safe . It 's funny . This is where we used to keep the hazardous biological materials . Guess not everything changes , huh ? - What can I do for you ? - I just wanted to thank you for helping Fitz . Well , for ... for being his friend . I don 't help him . He doesn 't need any . You know , that guy you 're wishing he would be ... I never met him . I only know this guy , and , uh ... Yeah , I mean , he 's a little weird , but , uh ... but I like him . I don 't want him to be anybody but himself . - You sure about that ? - Yes . Because I heard he told you how he felt and you bailed . - That 's not what happened . - Look I know you two have a past . But from what I 've seen , the only thing that makes him worse ... - ... is you . - I know . Why do you think I left ? You 're leaving ? S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s always been your thing . I won 't stand in the way of that . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s not S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore . I 'm still trying to figure out where I fit in , too . Just don 't die out there , all right ? But if you want to stay ... stay . Time to go . Hands . Dignitaries , ladies and gentlemen , less than 48 hours ago , brave men and women lost their lives at this very spot I 'm standing now , and I think we owe it to them to discuss something all too often elusive ... the truth . Sometimes we want things simpler than they actually are , but the tough reality is , we are complex creatures . - Skye . - If I ever see you again ... I 'll kill you . And I 've come to understand something that world must , as well . There is a difference between S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA . One was an organization built on protection , and the other ... world domination . We got Beckers at the border . - How many men did you lose ? - Six . It 's always a shame when a good soldier falls . And just as good and evil existed side-by-side within S.H.I.E.L.D. , the same was true in my own home . At first , I was ashamed to share this truth with the world , but my younger brother , Grant Ward , was a member of HYDRA . He was a traitor . He was a traitor to his friends , his family , and his nation . Do not give him one inch . Tell Skye this doesn 't change anything . I 'll keep my promise . When evil sits closest to one 's own heart , that is when the surest hand must cut it out . I give my word . I will personally make sure my brother is punished for his crimes . But as is so often true , the darkness lingers longer than the light . And while S.H.I.E.L.D. is gone , HYDRA is a problem that the world must still face . Otherwise , that darkness will grow and spread and cast a shadow over us all . We 'll return in a moment . You got cash this time ? Tonight , we finish it . It 's gonna hurt . The rest probably hasn 't healed yet . You sure you don 't want to wait a few days ? The pain helps me remember .

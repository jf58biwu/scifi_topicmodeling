 Look , Leonard , I know how you feel . Really , I do , but this is very important . She needs to get back to work . I know she isn 't very strong , but she can still kill a man with her bare hands . Don 't you forget who taught her that . I 'm here today with Professor Houlden , and he has something very exciting to share with us all . It is a momentous day for science and humankind alike . Isn 't that right , Dr. Houlden ? Yes , that 's correct . Could you tell us why ? Well , my team of scientists have discovered a way to create wormholes here on Earth . Could you tell us a little more about these wormholes ? Yes , wormholes allow matter to travel from one point in space to another quicker than light can travel the same path . And this could be used to foster time travel ? Well , theoretically yes , but that would require the manipulation and control of the space-time continuum , and right now , we 're not at that point . That would take a lot more research and controlling for ... Good morning . How 'd you sleep ? Pretty damn well . Training will do that to you . I didn 't work you too hard last night , did I ? You never do . So , you must be ready , then ? I 'm always ready . Come get some breakfast . Hi . Can I help you ? I 'm here to see Professor Houlden . Are you the research assistant ? Yeah . There was an ad in the paper . Take any one of those elevators behind you to the 12th floor , room 63 , and I 'll call the professor and let him know you 're on your way up . All right . Thanks . Are you going to the 12th floor ? Yeah , I am . You 're not here to see Professor Houlden , are you ? I am , actually . Are you coming ? It 's simple . All you have to do is ride the elevator for a few minutes . It 's painless . When you 're done , just come right back here . Good evening . My name is Bill Mixon , and I 've come to spread the good news . Have you considered surrendering your will to God ? Romek Tarlowski ... born in Warsaw , moved to East London at the age of five , spent time in Petersburg as a thief . I know you speak English . What do you want ? I have a job for you . I 'm on vacation . Take a look at this figure and reconsider . You 'll be getting a phone call within 24 hours . Bill ! Don 't call me .

Has she been training ? No , no . Not for a while , now . You know , I haven 't seen you kids in some time . Yeah , to be honest , Boss , she 's been better off . Really ? You know , I seem to remember the two of you being , well , you know , lost when I first met you . I didn 't mean that she was ... You didn 't mean ... You didn 't mean what ?

Let 's get down to business . Right . Here 's the plan . We 're going to send you back , um , in time . Right , time travel . Here 's how it works . You open up a wormhole ... I 'm not interested in your faggoty mathematics ! I just want to know if it 's going to work . And if it does work , am I going to die ? And if I don 't die , how am I going to make it back ? I can assure you that it works . We have tested the process several times . You will not be hurt . When you 're done , it will be your responsibility to open up another wormhole and proceed through it back here . What insurance do I have that I will make it back ? We are very serious about our work . We will pay you half now ... and half when you return . So what 's to stop me from killing you right now and taking all your money ? Mr. Tarlowski ... we control time . There is nothing you can do to me that my associates could not undo and then do to you . So who 's the target ? You 've got to be shitting me . I shit you not . Where did you get this ? I swiped it from Houlden 's office . This is unbelievable . The Black Coats want to go back in time and assassinate him ? Do you have any idea what might happen if they get away with this ? The scary thing is I really don 't . No one does . Where are you going ? Boss said I got a meeting with a group , call themselves the RATTS . Oh , uh , did he tell you what the job was ? Bunch of scientists . Radio name ? The Black Coats . Oh . I 'll be back later . Wait . Take this . So you 're telling me we have to kill Adolf Hitler ? No . We have to stop the man that 's gonna kill him . How do we even know that 's possible ? Boss says it is , and I don 't think it even matters . A mark is a mark . Let 's say he could travel back in time . How would he possibly get past the S.S. ? Get to him before there were any . I told you we didn 't have to do this . I told you that you didn 't owe Boss anything . I know your grandfather was in the war , but we can 't let these guys do this . Serena , if things didn 't go exactly the way they did , this could be a far worse world than we 're living in right now . If Hitler never happened , then somebody else would have done the same thing ... somebody more successful . If we don 't go down there ... Give me my gun back . We 're going on recon tomorrow . Boss said The Black Coats are having a meeting at a warehouse outside of town . Is that all ? For shit 's sake , don 't you knock ? What happened to all the grenades ? We used them . Wow . What do we need grenades for , anyway ? I thought this was recon . It is recon , but you never know what could happen . I know what 's gonna happen . We 're gonna sit in a car all day , or we 're gonna sit in a dumpster all day , or we 're gonna sit on a fucking toilet all day , and we 're not gonna ... reconnaisize anything . " Reconnaisize " ? Shut up . I 'll take the M4 . You take the vest . No , you take the vest . It doesn 't fit me , anyway . No way . Why not ? 'Cause I 'm not taking the rifle and the vest . It 's unfair . Besides , you 're a girl . You take the vest . I don 't want it . Who 's this guy ? That 's the triggerman Houlden hired . He doesn 't look so tough . I 've got a clear shot . I 'll wait 30 seconds . I 'll pull the car around . He will take the shot in half a minute . Sounds exciting . Don 't worry . I 'm sure this will work . Do I sound worried to you ? Do you think I 'm going to Wallace all over my brand-new shiny shoes ? No , not at all , actually . Listen , you 've got 20 seconds . 15 , 14 , 13 , 12 , 11 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 7 , 6 , 5 , 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... Duck . Fucking hell , you were right . Of course . How else would I have known they were going to shoot you at exactly that second ? Last time , you got shot . We couldn 't let that happen again . Can 't believe it . I had him . He dropped right as I pulled the trigger . I had him . He knew everything we were going to do . How ? I don 't know . I mean , even if they knew where we were ... he dropped right as I pulled the trigger . That 's impossible . Unless ... Unless what ? Unless we already shot him . Already shot him ? What ? Maybe ... we already killed him . What are you talking about ? You missed . I didn 't miss the first time . You can 't be serious . I shot him . They undid it . They undid it ? Yeah , they figured out where we were , when we shot ... everything . They went back in time . Then they made sure we failed . But this isn 't the past . It 's the present . Only to us . If that 's what happened , how are we going to stop them if they undo every attack we make ? We have to call the RATTS . It came at a bad time . Only his behavior after this murder gave him away . Ah , come on . This is crap . Are you serious ? This movie 's awesome . The shootouts are amazing . Uh , no . This is so unrealistic . Come on . Who takes out 50 guys by himself without breaking a fucking fingernail ? I do . Yeah , right . You 'd go crying home to your mommy . Yeah , would I ? " Mommy , Mommy , I got a hangnail , and I can 't kill the bad men . " Cut it out . What 's the matter with you ? I 'm tired . I 'm tired of hearing that . Really , what 's up ? I don 't know . I guess I 'm still kinda freaked out by all this time-travel stuff . Yeah ? I mean ... what if all this has already happened ? What if it 's always happening ? What if it keeps happening over and over again ? How do you mean ? You know vinyl , records ? Like L.P.s ? Yeah . What if time is like a record ? If life just plays out , like a needle passes over it ... it seems like it 's going somewhere , but ... it actually all exists at the same time ... the past , the present , the future . It 's just the needle that changes . What if it 's the same thing being played over and over again ... the same songs ... they never change ? Why does that bother you ? Just don 't like the idea of living the same life over and over again . Not this one , anyway . I think I know what you mean . Remind yourself of what this is all about . These bastards may destroy the world as we know it if they pull off time travel . It may not seem like a bad idea to them , but we don 't know what kind of repercussions that could have . We have to silence everyone with knowledge about this time-travel project . Boss has Serena and Leonard coordinating their attack at the same time as ours . Any questions ? Cyrus ? Who 's the first target ? Michael Roberts , physics expert . He started the project with Houlden about six years ago . Where is he ? He 's about five feet from the right of this van . Close it ! I 've got some bad news . What 's that ? The RATTS took out Roberts . Yeah , yeah , I know . So you know , do you ? Yes , they are going to take out the whole team today . Haven 't we got to stop ' em ? No . Uh , we 're gonna let them go ahead with it up until a point , that is . What point would that be ? When they get to me . So we 're just going to let those boy scouts go ? Yes . It 's all part of the plan . Eddie ! Boss . Tarlowski , heel . So this is Tarlowski ? You recommended him . Yeah , but I never met the guy . I only heard the stories , Polack with the fake accent . Oi , I grew up in London . You wouldn 't shoot a fellow Polack , would you ? You said he was the best . Yeah , how 's that holding up ? We 'll see soon enough . How 's the attack coming ? Oh , that 's right , the RATTS . I got them and Serena and Leonard going after your scientist friends , The Black Coats . They 're not my friends . No , I suppose it isn 't very friendly to order their assassination . I trust you told them to hit me last , correct ? Hey , where 's the time machine ? It 's over there . Golly . That 's a piece of work . Impressive , isn 't it ? It sure is . What the hell is Boss doing with our target ? I don 't know , but we weren 't supposed to see it . How do you know ? We were supposed to wait until the attack today . What do you think ? I think this was a setup . I don 't like the guy , but I don 't think he would set us up . You don 't know what he 's capable of . Hey , kid . What is this ? It looks like a .45 . What were you doing at the warehouse ? What 's the matter ? Can 't I talk to some old friends ? They 're your marks . No , they 're your marks . They 're my friends . What is this all about ? What do you think it 's about ? Maybe it 's a cover , maybe you have to keep your enemies close ... or maybe it 's a setup . Is that what you think ? That I sent you on a suicide mission ? Just decided to get rid of you after five years ? Or maybe I just wanted to get rid of your friend Leonard there , filling your head with bullshit and drugs , turning you into a fucking invalid ! Fuck you , Boss . You ruined my life , not him . Yeah , you used to be a warrior . I was a little girl ! Are you gonna kill me ? I 'm getting bored . This is over . Call the RATTS . Call off the attack . Well ... I would , kid , but ... I don 't think they 're gonna answer . They 're already dead . You 're lying . Just tying up some loose ends for a friend , figured I would tie up a few of my own ... The Black Coats , the RATTS , Leonard ... all in one day . I suppose it was a little too ambitious to expect it to go so smoothly . So you gonna shoot me or not ? No . I can 't . I didn 't think so . Leonard can . Serena . Leonard . Serena , I 'm so sorry . Don 't worry about it . It was my fault . I should have known better . Who hit me ? The triggerman , Tarlowski . I 'll take care of him . I promise . Boss , too . Boss ? Yeah , he got away . Leonard , no . I will take care of this . No . You 'll wait for me . Don 't do anything without me . You don 't know how he works . Is it true about the RATTS ? Yeah , they 're all dead . So it 's just us against them . Seems that way . Don 't worry . I won 't leave until you do . Thank you . Turner . Mommy , it 's snowing . Snowing ? Really ? Come inside , dear . What is it ? It 's snowing . That 's not snow , boy . That 's ash . How long are you gonna keep us here ? Well ... the Allied forces are closing on the Motherland , and Hitler 's commanding officers are desperate , so I would say you can expect to be taken out of here within 24 hours ... to be executed . Have you ever executed a man ? No . Have you ever seen a man executed ? No . What were they thinking ? They could just send you over here so that you could ... take the Führer 's head ? Well , good luck to you . Both of you . But I have to say ... Sarge , they 're gassing us . Those goddamn Krauts are gassing us . Stay calm . Put that on , and breathe . Jesus Christ , Sarge , stay calm ? You know what this stuff does to you ? It 's only smoke , soldier . Sarge , we gotta get out of here . What 's your name , soldier ? Say again . - Your name ? what 's your name , soldier ? McCoy , Private McCoy . James Donovan . Don 't worry , McCoy . We 'll get out of here . How 's that ? You got a plan ? You know that Kraut that threw me in here ? I broke three of his fingers while he was searching me . What good does that do for us now ? He stopped searching me after that . They didn 't find Serena . Who 's Serena ? This is Serena . Make it quick . They make ' em young nowadays , don 't they ? What are you waiting for ? I can 't just let you go so you can pop up in my car tomorrow . Are you some kind of amateur ? I get it . You 're not even a little triggergirl , are you ? Wow , you had me going there for a minute . I 'll tell you what . I need to make a phone call . You probably took that while you were robbing me of my worldly possessions . I 'll let you keep the phone and anything else you took , but I need to make a phone call , okay ? Dial Mr. Hollister . Tell him ... Heh . Tell him there 's no coffee left in the pot . Tell him Boss said so . There 's no coffee left in the pot . Boss said so . I don 't have a name . No name , huh ? What about Serena ? Isn 't that you ? If you want . People call me Boss , 'cause I 'm so pushy . Nice to meet you . Can I go now ? Yeah , I 'll let you go . Just one thing before you run off to your squat . Do you want a job , Serena ? I 'm too young to get a job . But you 're not too young to starve , you 're not too young to get put away for larceny , and I don 't think you 're too young for my line of work . I 'm not a whore . Of course not . Do I look like a pimp to you ? Oh , no , that 's not my line of work . What do you do ? Come with me . I 'll show you . Why me ? I just hate to see a young girl like you waste away on the streets . You don 't want to live like that . I mean , look at those people . You deserve better . I gotta drop something off at a friend 's . Come with me . If I do anything you don 't like , you can shoot me . Okay ? What do I get out of it ? 50 bucks . Make it 100 . Okay , 100 bucks . Sound fair ? All right , I 'll go . But I swear , if you do anything creepy , I 'll shoot you in the face . Deal . So , you know how to break into a car , but have you ever stolen one ? All right , you see the case in the back there ? Yeah . Grab it . What 's in it ? Don 't open it , for shit 's sake . Okay . Just take it up to the doorstep , set it down , and ring the bell . Do you want me to light it on fire first ? Heh . The fire 'll come later . Just go now before the neighbors get suspicious . Okay . Doorbell . That was easy . Yeah , for you , it was . Was that a bomb in the briefcase ? Yes , it was . Ouch , eh ? That 's gotta sting . Who opened it ? Uh , nobody important . Did he have a family ? Oh , no . No . I wouldn 't risk a child 's life . A woman , maybe , if she deserved it , but generally not . Just miserable bastards . We have a saying in my profession . " No women , no children , except the son with a gun and the wife with a knife . " Boss . Yeah ? Next time , tell me when there 's something in the case . Sure . Well , here 's your 100 bucks . A deal 's a deal . Where do you live ? I 'll drop you off . I don 't have a home . I thought I was joking before about that squat thing . You don 't have any friend 's place you could stay at or anything ? No . All right , you 'll stay at my place , then . I can 't have my new apprentice end up dead on the streets . All right , but that shoot-you-in-the-face-for-being-creepy thing still applies . Same to you . Hmm . That should be enough , right ? Yeah , it 's fine . You know , you 're a tough girl . I bet this beats sleeping in an alleyway , right ? Right . Yeah . And don 't bother trying to sneak into my room to molest me , 'cause I keep the door locked . Same to you . I sleep with my eyes open . Now , that 's creepy . Yeah , I know . All right , good night . I 'll be at the end of the hall if you need anything . Serena , pineapple . They 're tailing us . I told you to grab the case . I had the case in the car . Yeah , well , that was last night . Well , why did you move it ? Because we can 't leave a case of explosives in the car overnight . - why not ? Because of people like you who steal shit out of cars . Never mind . Start shooting . You see ? Keep one in the chamber . That way when you reload , you don 't need to rack the slide , so you can keep shooting if you need to . I 'm gonna kill you , motherfucker ! Like I said , it 's not easy to fire someone in this business . I 've had a lot of time to think . I 've made up my mind , and if you don 't agree , I 'll leave . I 've made it on my own before , and I can do it now . Anyways , look , I 'm tired of tagging along and carrying your bullets around . I want to do a job . The only way I can do that is with your help . I want the training that you had . Absolutely not ! You couldn 't handle it , not for a minute . Boss . Do you even realize what you 're asking of me ? Yes , and I want you to do it for me . No , I can 't . Then I 'm leaving . Look , Serena , maybe I can get somebody else to help you out . No . No , I want it from you . All right . But you 're not gonna like it . You 're not fooling anybody . Okay , I 'm heading out . When I get back , we 'll get started . Help yourself to the fridge , but leave the TV off between 12 : 00 and 1 : 00 . Why ? I 'm recording a show . What show ? Stories . What stories ? It 's a prison term ... soap operas . When were you in prison ? Ah , years ago . What for ? Concealed weapon . - How long ? A year . They couldn 't trace it to anything , 'cause I hadn 't used it yet . It was my first gun . Does this explain how you got into your business ? Sort of . See , when I got out of the military , I married a girl named Lisa . Her family was in the Irish mob based out of Boston . Uh-huh . So after I got married , they expected me to do certain things for ' em , run drugs and crap like that . I wouldn 't do it . Why not ? Because I hate drugs . They 're the AIDS of society . Besides , I just got out of a war , and I wanted some peace and quiet . Anyway . They didn 't appreciate my not cooperating . I divorced my wife , and the Micks put a hit out on me . Hey , I 'm Irish . Well , good for you . You want to hear this or not ? Yes . So I got a gun to protect myself . It 's not like I didn 't know how to use one . I was used to having a gun by then . I just wasn 't used to carrying around a permit for one . So after I got out , they were still after me . I had to kill a few of ' em . I found it a lot easier than I expected , killing citizens . An enemy 's an enemy , no matter where they 're from . So it just sorta stuck . I started killing people who needed killing . You mean you kill people that needed to be killed . No . I killed people who needed killing done . You know , jealous husbands , maniac wives . They would come to me saying they wanted their spouse dead . I 'd tell the spouse , make ' em disappear for a little while , convince the client the job was done , collect my money and then kill the client , then collect from the spouse . You killed the people that hired you ? Provided the spouse would pay me more . You 'd be amazed at how vengeful someone gets when they learn their dearly beloved wants them dead . And I leave the situation with a clear conscience , knowing the victim started the whole problem and got what they deserved . I mean , honestly , how can you marry someone and then hire a thug like me to shoot ' em in the back just ' cause you 're unhappy ? Oh , they deserve what they got . That 's amazing . - Yep . After all this time , I had no idea . You still watch soap operas . You asshole . The secret to killing people is ... there is no secret . People kill each other all the time . They 're just no good at getting away with it . You know how to kill someone in any given situation . It 's human instinct . You will react to any situation without hesitation . You will shut out all of your emotions .

I mean , it was your grandfather 's , and now it 's yours . He would have wanted you to have it . He insisted that you were named after it . What 's it for ? I can 't keep you here , Serena . You have to go . Go ? This should get you a couple of bucks at the pawnshop . Go and stay with a friend for a while until you find another place . I 'll make it up to you someday , I promise , but for now , you have to go . What friend ? Hon , can you give Jake a bath ? I 'm going out . Yeah , all right . Where you going ? Going to the mall with Linda . Okay , have fun . Don 't forget . Your father called here again . So what ? Now he 's not allowed to call me ? He wasn 't calling for you . He wanted to talk to me . What did he want ? - Oh , you know what he wants . So why don 't you just do it ? It wouldn 't kill you to help him out a little bit . I don 't want to help him out , and I don 't want him calling here for me anymore . What are you so afraid of ? You 're not gonna get in any trouble . Nobody gets caught with that shit . I 'm afraid of the United States penal system . I 'm afraid of Jake growing up without a father , spiders . I 'll tell you what I 'm not afraid of , your fucking Guido-Mick father trying to strong-arm me into being his bitch . I wasn 't anybody 's bitch in prison . I 'll be damned if I 'm gonna be anybody 's bitch out in the suburbs . Fuck you ! Fuck your family . Look , I paid you to do a job , so do it as I asked you . All right , lady . We already discussed the terms , okay ? Just get out of my way . I 'll get out of your fucking way when you start to fucking listen . No blood on my bed . Got it ? Let me work . I 'll sort it out . And God damn it , stop talking . He 's gonna hear us . No , no , no , no , no ! Oh , no ! That 's what I thought . That 's what I thought . All right , then . Goodbye . What the fuck was that ? ! What are you , some kind of special ? Who did I tell you not to shoot ? Boss . Never mind the girl . She 's a threat . She has to be treated as such . We had a deal , Ed . Yeah , I ... I know we had a deal until she became a problem . I think you 'd be hard-pressed to say she 's not a problem after she pulled that gun to your head . If you can 't keep your eyes on the target , I 'll tear ' em out of your fucking head ! Bob , calm down . Have a smoke . Wipe that blood off your face . And as for you , think it 's time we move on to our primary objective . Fucking wuss . Goddamn amateur . What the fuck is your problem , anyway ? What is the matter with you ? I 'll just do it alone if you can 't handle it . I 'll do it by myself . I 'll go alone . Karl ? I thought you were dead . Pretty close . What happened ? It 's hard to say , really . We were about three marks in , and on the fourth , the shit just hit the fan . My guys were inside the house when all the lights went out . They went for their flashlights , but ... It 's okay . I know . Oh , shit . You look like shit . Long day at the office . Do you have any .45 A.C.P. around here ? Yeah , in the closet there . Have you spoken with Boss yet ? I ... I can 't seem to get ahold of him . Karl . We should probably tell him the mission has failed , several dead . Karl ... It was a setup . A setup ? Boss set us up . Suicide mission . Oh . He and Houlden are working together . The real targets were you , the RATTS , me and Leonard ... and The Black Coats , minus Houlden , of course . This is unbelievable . It 's a bit out of tune . Yeah , a bit . Okay . Got some painkillers if you need any . No . How did you get so bloody ? Kinda had to jump out of a second-story window . Jesus . Well , I 'm no miracle worker , just lucky . It 's probably not safe here . It 's definitely not safe here . We should bail . What do you want to do ? I 'm gonna get as much ammo as I can and hop the next train right out of here . Do you want to go with me ? Okay . I 'll meet you at the station . Why don 't we go now ? I have a couple things I need to do first . Are you sure ? Do you need any help ? No , I 'm all set . Suit yourself . Oh , but , Serena ... Yeah ? wherever you 're going ... maybe you should wear this . Doesn 't fit . It 's adjustable . That 's not so bad , right ? WOHey , he 's got a gun . Serena . Serena , are you there ? Here . Have a smoke . Settle the fuck down . Got a light , big guy ? I 'll light it if you come over and calm down . Come on , darling . Just tell me you 're sorry , and we 'll forget all about this , and I 'll just walk away . You 're not walking away from this one . Look at us , couple of bloody subhumans with guns , as if we were made this way by some necessity for balance in a world that would suffocate without evil . We 're the tar in their lungs , Serena , so breathe it in . Do you feel special yet , doll ? God save the Queen . Hey ! God save the Queen . God save the Queen . God save the Queen ! God save the fucking Queen ! Where 's the machine ? What machine ? Don 't make me come over there . Oh , that 's right . The time machine . What you 're looking for is in the room , second door down on the left . But I 'm warning you . You don 't want to go in there . Why the hell not ? Some doors , once opened , cannot be closed . You don 't want to see what 's behind that door . I suppose you were expecting some sort of time-travel device . Well ... no such thing exists . Of course , we scientists have our theories . Theories ? I 'd side with the wormhole theorists , but we haven 't gotten very far with that . Others believe that time , all of time , exists at once . Physically it 's like a videocassette . It exists all at once , but when you watch , you move from moment to moment , from beginning to end . Really , the mental theories are the most fascinating . They hold that all of reality is ... is bound together by individual thought . They believe that with the right amount of concentration , one can bring themselves so deeply into a memory that the present , as they know it , disappears . Whether or not they can do anything differently than what they did in the past , I have no idea . They 're all construed with paradox , but ... what isn 't ? Well , I really ought to be going . Perhaps I 'll leave you with a little quote from Silesius . " Time is of your own making . " Its clock ticks in your head . " The moment you stop thought , time , too , stops dead . " Serena ? Serena ? Boss , don 't kill me . Why not ? I can 't ... I can 't ... You can 't ? You can 't what ? You know what I think ? I think I should kill you , you treacherous bitch . Boss , why ? Why what ? Why did you have to kill Leonard ? Why ? ! You fucking beat-up old man ! Tell me ! It 's because he took me from you , isn 't it ? Your beloved Leonard . Good old Leonard ! Let me tell you something about Leonard , my poor naive Serena . Leonard wanted you dead . Bullshit . Oh , of course . You can 't believe me . What do I know ? I think you 're forgetting something . I think you 've forgotten how I work after that little vacation there with Leonard . Shall I refresh your drug-swamped mind ? Now , I think it should come back pretty quickly , because I 've told you this before . I kill people that need killing . Leonard wanted some killing of you . Unfortunate for him , he didn 't know my operation , so I thought ... let 's do something nice for Serena . Let 's spare her the grief of feeling like nobody could ever really love her . Let 's invent an enemy and have Leonard die in the line of duty , all valiant and brave . Therefore , everyone 's happy . Leonard at least gets to die with dignity , Mr. Muffins and his time travel doesn 't have a pesky radical group after him or wacko scientists trying to fuck with the space-time continuum . You ... you don 't develop some kind of everybody-in-my-life - abandons-me complex . The world 's happy , because it 's short one cowardly little bastard who didn 't have the guts to kill somebody himself . And I 'm happy ... because , in the end , you 'd be safe . He cared about me . Did you care about him ? Did you take the time to notice ? Do you think all those husbands who hired me went home and acted like they wanted their wives dead ? No ! They 'd snuggle up next to them in bed ... kiss them good night and dream sweet dreams of a life without them . This got so fucked up ! Boss . Yeah ?

What the hell you been doing ? I 've been trying to get ahold of you for hours . You know , business as usual . About that , I was talking to our mutual friend . Said there 's a lot of static about someone trying to take you out . It may be someone on the inside , maybe not . I can 't be sure . He didn 't tell me much . I just thought you should watch yourself . I guess there 's no escaping fate , is there ? Oh , boy . Are you in one of your moods ? Fate isn 't about what 's gonna happen , what you 're gonna do . It 's about what already happened , what you 've already done . There 's no changing that . What you can do is decide what happens next . We 've all got options , Boss .

 ( Indistinct conversations ) Tris : We 're lucky to be in the city . That the rest of the world was destroyed . Our founders built the wall to keep us safe and they divided us into five groups , factions , to keep the peace . The smart ones , the ones who value knowledge and logic are in erudite . They know everything . ( Yelling indistinctly ) Amity farm the land . They 're all about kindness and harmony , always happy . Candor value honesty and order . They tell the truth , even when you wish they wouldn 't . ( Cheering ) And then there 's dauntless . They 're our protectors , our soldiers , our police . I always thought they were amazing . Brave , fearless and free . Some people think dauntless are crazy , which they kind of are . ( Laughing ) Man : Come on , Beatrice . My faction is abnegation . The others all call us " stiffs . " We lead a simple life , selfless , dedicated to helping others . We even feed the factionless , the ones who don 't fit in anywhere . Because we 're public servants , we 're trusted to run the government . My father works alongside our leader , Marcus . It all works . Everyone knows where they belong . Except for me . ( Snipping ) My mother says there 's an art to losing yourself . But I haven 't figured it out yet . I 'm supposed to never think of myself , to always help others . To never look too long in the mirror . Are you nervous ? ( Inhales deeply ) No . Were you ? For your test ? Mmm-mm . No . I was terrified . ( Chuckles softly ) But I didn 't have any reason to be and neither do you . That 's all you get . Rules are rules . Tris : Today I take the test . I 'm scared it 'll tell me I 'm not abnegation . That I have to leave my family . But I 'm even more scared that it will tell me to stay . For my brother Caleb , it 's easy . Caleb : Let me help you with that . Tris : He 's a natural . Beatrice , do you wanna get the other bags ? Sorry . Caleb : What if she 'd been blind or an amputee ? Would you have helped her then ? I was thinking about helping her . Caleb : It 's not that hard . For you , maybe . Just relax , Beatrice . Take a deep breath and trust the test . Tris : Trust the test . Test will tell me who I am , where I belong . Am I smart ? Kind ? Am I honest ? Selfless ? Or brave ? Hey . So , all the food that we 're not getting , you guys are giving away to the factionless ? Right ? Yeah ? Yeah . You 're a liar . Why are you lying to me ? Everybody knows you keep it for yourselves . So why don 't you just admit it ? Huh ? I 'm talking to you . Are all you stiffs deaf or somethin ' ? Hey ! Beatrice ... Don 't . ( Sighs ) ( Train approaching ) ( Shouting indistinctly ) One hundred years ago , after the war , our founders created a system they believed would prevent future conflict and create lasting peace . Today , aptitude testing based on your personality will assign you to one of the factions . While it is our belief that choosing the faction indicated by your test is the best way to ensure success within the faction system , it is your right tomorrow at the choosing ceremony to choose any of the five factions , regardless of your test results . However , once the choice has been made , there will be no change permitted . ( Woman on pa speaking indistinctly ) What is it with you abnegation and mirrors ? We reject vanity . Yeah . I know . Sit down . I 'm Tori . I 'll be administering your test . You 'll be offered a series of choices to test your aptitude for each faction until you get one result . I wouldn 't sweat it . 95 % get the faction of their origin , and from the looks of you ... What is it ? Bottoms up . ( Sighs ) Choose . Now . Before it 's too late . Why ? What will I do with them ? Choose . Just tell me . ( Dog barks ) ( Gasps ) ( Dog snarling ) ( Dog whining ) Little girl : Puppy ! ( Snarling ) ( Barking ) ( Gasps ) Get up . We 're going out the back door before a supervisor comes . But what was my result ? Come on ! What happened ? You 're going to tell your family that the serum made you sick and that I sent you home . All right ? No , but what was my result ? Abnegation . And erudite . And dauntless . Dauntless ... Your results were inconclusive . That 's impossible . It doesn 't make any sense . No . Not impossible . It 's just extremely rare . They call it " divergent . " You can 't tell anyone about this . Not even your parents . As far as the world is concerned , you received an abnegation result because that is what I manually entered . So what am I supposed to do at the choosing ceremony ? I was supposed to learn what to do . This was supposed to tell me what faction to choose , the test . We 're supposed to trust the test . The test didn 't work on you . You have to trust yourself . ( Man coughing ) ( Door closes ) What happened to you today ? Where did you go after your test ? I got sick , so they sent me home early . Did you finish your test ? Mmm-hmm . What was your result ? What was yours ? Andrew : Why did you just leave without telling anybody ? I was sick . Andrew : Beatrice ... I don 't think you understand the level of scrutiny we 're under . They 're doing everything they can to discredit us right now . Who is ? Erudite . They believe that they should be the governing faction , not us . So you have to be careful right now , okay ? Even Marcus is under attack . For what ? It 's an old accusation . That he mistreated his son and that 's why the boy defected . Is that true ? No . 'Course not . Children defect for all kinds of reasons . Don 't take too long in here . You need a good night 's sleep ... For tomorrow . I , um ... We love you . Good night . Natalie : ( Softly ) I 'm so proud of you , honey . ( Sighs ) Caleb : Beatrice ? What ? Tomorrow when we choose ... You have to think of the family . Yeah . But you also have to think of yourself . ( Indistinct conversations ) ( Woman on pa speaking indistinctly in distance ) ( All speaking indistinctly ) ( Man on pa speaking indistinctly ) ( Indistinct talking ) Man : ( On pa ) Factions , please gather in your assigned areas . Morning , jeanine . Good morning , Andrew . How is Marcus holding up ? As well as can be expected . We need to find out who 's behind these rumors . I think we all know who it is . If it 's someone from erudite , I promise I 'll find out who . These are your children . I don 't think I knew they were choosing today . What 's your name ? I 'm ... I 'm Caleb . It 's a pleasure to meet you . Jeanine Matthews . And you are ? This is Beatrice . Well , you both have a big decision to make today . I 'm sure your parents will support whatever choice you make . That 's not supposed to be a choice . The test should tell us what to do . You 're still free to choose . But you don 't really want that . Beatrice ... I want you to choose who you truly are and where you truly belong . Not on a whim . Not because you wish you were someone you 're not . But because you honestly know yourself . I want you to choose wisely . And I know you will . ( Applause ) The faction system is a living being composed of cells , all of you . And the only way it can survive and thrive is for each of you to claim your rightful place . The future belongs to those who know where they belong . When we leave this room , you will no longer be dependents but full-fledged members of our society . Faction before blood . All : Faction before blood . I love you ... No matter what . Marcus : Jonathan ziegler . Marcus : Erudite . ( All applauding ) Marcus : Jeffrey yates . Dauntless . ( All cheering ) Morgan Stokes . Amity . ( Sobbing ) Marcus : Claire satron . Candor . Sam robertson . Abnegation . Caleb prior . Erudite . ( Faint gasps ) ( All applauding ) Marcus : Quiet , please . Beatrice prior . Dauntless . ( All dauntless cheering ) Welcome to dauntless ! ( All cheering ) Boy : Come on ! Let 's go ! Girl : Come on ! Sorry . You made it . I 'm Christina . Beatrice . Is it just me or are they trying to kill us ? Get ready ! ( Woman on pa announcing indistinctly ) Yeah ! They 're jumping . What ? ( Whooping continues ) What if you don 't jump ? What do you think ? You 'll be factionless . Good luck , Al . Whoa ! ( Grunts ) ( Whooping ) Together ? Yeah . One , two , three ... ( Both grunting ) ( Both laughing ) Eric : All right , listen up ! I 'm Eric . I 'm one of your leaders . If you want to enter dauntless , this is the way in . And if you don 't have the guts to jump , then you don 't belong in dauntless . Is there water at the bottom or something ? I guess you 'll find out . Or not . We just jumped . They want us to jump again ? Someone 's gotta go first . Who 's it gonna be ? Me . Yeah , stiff , take it off ! Put it back on ! ( Grunts ) Today , initiate . ( Gasps ) ( Gasps ) ( Panting ) ( Chuckling ) What , you get pushed ? No . What 's your name ? It 's ... Is that a hard one ? You can pick a new one if you want , but make it good . You don 't get to pick again . Okay ... my name 's tris . First jumper , tris ! ( People cheering ) Welcome to dauntless . ( Boy screaming ) ( Shrieks ) Dauntless-born , go with Lauren , transfers stay with me . Go . Lauren : This way . Most of the time I work in intelligence , but during your training , I 'll be your instructor . My name 's four . Four like the number ? Exactly like the number . What happened , one through three were taken ? What 's your name ? Christina . Well , Christina . The first lesson you learn from me if you wanna survive here , is keep your mouth shut . Do you understand me ? ( Softly ) Yes . Good . Follow me . ( Indistinct talking and cheering ) The center of life here at dauntless . ( Cheering and shouting ) You 're gonna be sleeping here for the next 10 weeks . Girls or boys ? Both . Girl 1 : Nice . Boy 1 : That works . If you like this , you 're gonna love the bathroom . Girl 2 : Great . Boy 1 : Okay ... Girl 2 : Seriously ? Boy 2 : Is there no other area ? Girl 2 : Are you kidding ? You should feel right at home , candor . Everything out in the open . Boy 2 : Is this a joke ? Four : Get changed . Right . Shower , anyone ? ( Indistinct talking ) Peter : Nice legs , stiff . ( Indistinct talking ) ( Rock music playing ) Boy 1 : Hey . Boy 2 : How you doin ' ? Shall we sit there ? Have you never seen a hamburger before ? No , I 've seen one . I just have never eaten one . Abnegation eat plain food . Plant-based diet with no sauces and a minimum of seasoning . Which textbook did you swallow ? ( Chuckles ) Nice to meet you , too . I 'm will . Erudite . Of course you are . No offense , but I 'm surprised abnegation even eats at all . Too selfish , right ? No wonder you left . You gotta be pretty self-confident to be friends with a candor . What is that supposed to mean ? You have no filter . You say the first thing that comes into your head . You mean like , " you 're an idiot " ? ( All chuckling ) Nice one , Al . At least we tell the truth . Erudite can tell the truth because we have the facts . I don 't want to hear about your old factions . You 're dauntless now . Were you a transfer , too ? Or dauntless-born ? Are you kidding ? No . What makes you think you can talk to me ? It ... Must be because you 're so approachable . ( Christina scoffs ) Careful . Man : Four ... ( Speaking indistinctly ) You , my friend , have a death wish . ( Whispering ) You know , he was first in his class . They tried to recruit him for leadership twice , but he said no . ( Alarm blaring ) ( Cups clattering ) ( Clanking continues ) Initiates , stand . You have chosen to join the warrior faction tasked with the defense of this city and all its inhabitants . We believe in ordinary acts of bravery and the courage that drives one person to stand up for another . Respect that . Do us proud . ( All cheering ) ( Laughing ) Whoa ! ( Laughing ) ( Cheering ) ( Metal clanking loudly ) I want everyone in the pit . Two minutes . ( Man yelling orders ) ( People speaking indistinctly ) There are two stages of training . The first is physical . Push your bodies to the breaking point and you 'll master the methods of combat . The second is mental . Again , breaking point . You 'll face your worst fears and conquer them unless they get you first . You 'll be trained separately from the dauntless-born , but you 'll be ranked together . After initiations , rankings will determine what jobs you move into . Leadership , guarding the fence , or keeping the factionless from killing each other . The rankings will also determine who gets cut . Cut ? At the end of each stage of training , the lowest-ranking initiates will be leaving us . To do what ? There 's no going home to your families , so you 'd live factionless . Why didn 't we know that ? It 's a new rule . A new rule ? Somebody should have told us that . Eric : Why ? Would you have chosen differently ? Out of fear ? I mean , if that 's the case , you might as well get out now . If you 're really one of us , it won 't matter to you that you might fail . Now you chose us . Now we get to choose you . ( Panting ) ( Grunting ) ( Sighs ) Statistically speaking , you should have hit the target at least once by now . Even by accident . Hey . What have you got ? Factionless . Not doing anything . Check it out , stiff . That 's gonna be your new family . ( Baby crying ) ( Bottles clinking ) Go say " hi . " You ready for some real fighting ? Not even close . Eric : First jumper ! In the ring . Last jumper ! Time to fight . ( Indistinct murmurings ) How long do we fight for ? Till one of you can 't continue . Or one of you concedes . According to the old rules . New rules , no one concedes . You really want to lose 'em on their first fight ? A brave man never surrenders . Lucky for you , those weren 't the rules when we fought . You 'll be scored on this , so fight hard . Go ! Peter : Don 't be scared , stiff ! ( Grunts ) Christina : Nice , tris ! ( Grunts ) ( Gasps ) Boy 1 : Nice . Boy 2 : Yeah ! ( Indistinct conversations ) All right , guys , over here . Listen up . Know what this board is ? It 's your life . We grade you every day . If you 're still in the red by the end of the first stage , you 're out . Tris : I 'm never gonna make it . Christina : Yes , you are . I 'm the weakest one here . Then you 'll be most improved . You 're candor . You 're not supposed to lie . I was candor . And I 'm not lying . If they cut me , I think my parents would take me back . Will : No , it doesn 't work like that . Even if they wanted to , their faction wouldn 't allow it . Even if my parents would take me back , I wouldn 't belong there anymore . This is getting depressing . Al : ( Chuckling ) Yeah . Christina : You know what we should do ? Get tattoos . ( Hip-hop music playing ) Will : Did you know they had a tattoo of your face ? Like it ? Will : Yeah . Where would you get it ? I don 't know . Where do you suggest ? Anywhere you want . Here , it 's this thing here . You remember me , right ? I was just wondering if you could ... No . I just do tattoos . Okay . I 'd like this one . Please . ( Powering up ) Can I just ask you ... You made a mistake choosing dauntless . They 'll find out about you ... Who ? Who will ? The people you 're a threat to . What people ? Who , dauntless ? No , society . If you don 't fit into a category , they can 't control you . I don 't get it . I 'm dauntless . I 'm going to be dauntless . I chose dauntless . Tori : For your sake , I hope so . ( Grunts ) ( Punches rapidly landing ) You 're weak . You have no muscle . You 're never gonna win , not like that . That 's good to know . Yeah , you 're gonna have to use your whole body . Keep tension here . Okay ... And go on offense . You 're fast , so you could win if you attack first . You get inside , you jab to the throat . Eric : Four ! Keep working . ( Groaning ) Al : Sorry about that , will . ( Christina grunting ) Come on , Chris . ( Grunts ) Stop ... stop ! ( Coughs ) I 'm done . I 'm done . You need to stop ? ( Panting ) Okay . Let me give you a hand . Thanks . All right , let 's everyone take a break ! You feelin ' a little better ? Yeah , I 'm fine . ( Shrieks ) Whoa ! Eric : Grab the rail . ( Grunting ) Or don 't . ( Gasps ) You 've got three options . Hang there and I 'll forget your cowardice . Fall and die . ( Christina groaning ) Or give up . But if you give up , you 're out . ( Christina panting ) ( Grunts ) Come on , Chris ! ( Christina groaning ) ( Metal creaking ) ( Straining ) Time ! ( Continues grunting ) ( Panting ) Dauntless never give up . ( Panting ) ( Sobbing ) Four : As dauntless , we fight to protect every life inside the fence , without fail . That 's why we train you the way we do . To teach you not to give up . And to find out who has what it takes . Even though it 's been quiet out there for years , that could change at any moment . So we have to be ready for everything . Boy : Whoo ! What 's out there ? Monsters . ( Chuckles ) Amity farms . No , I know . But beyond that ? Places that never recovered from the war . Do you know ? Let 's just say they built their fence for a reason . ( Girl grunting ) Boy : Man ! ( Boy laughs ) You 're kinda good at this . Boy : Come on . ( Clanging ) That was pathetic . ( Clanging ) ( Scoffs ) It slipped . Well , go get it ! What , while they 're throwing ? Are you afraid ? Of getting stabbed by an airborne knife ? Yeah . Everybody stop . Stand in front of the target . Four , gimme a hand here . You 're gonna stand there while he throws those knives . And if I see you flinch , you 're out . One thing you will learn here is that orders are not optional . ( Sighs ) Stop . Anyone can stand in front of a target . It doesn 't prove anything . Then it should be easy for you to take his place . Same rules apply . ( Sighs ) Oh , come on , four . You can get closer than that . You want me to give her a little trim ? Yeah , maybe just a little off the top . ( Breathing heavily ) ( Grunts ) Points for bravery , stiff . Not as many as you just lost for opening your mouth . Now watch yourself . We train soldiers , not rebels . But we 're done for today . Get out . ( Indistinct conversations ) You all right ? You cut me . I meant to . You meant to ? You think he was gonna let you off without a scratch ? You 'd still be standing there if I hadn 't hit you . So am I supposed to thank you ? You 're supposed to be smart . If I wanted to hurt you , I would have . ( All cheering ) There she is . You do have a death wish . I can 't believe you said that to Eric . You 're the only one who 's ever stood up to him . Look at your ear . Let 's get you cleaned up . Hey , tris . That was cool . Thanks . ( Chuckles ) ( Snickering ) Impressive , stiff . Congrats . Will : Shut up . What ? Hey , you 're famous now . Boy : Hold up . I mean , not because of the thing with Eric . You 're in the news . Yeah , listen . " The recent transfers of Beatrice and Caleb prior , " children of Andrew prior , " call into question the soundness " of abnegation 's teachings and values . " What prompted them to leave ? " Perhaps the answer lies in the corrupted ideal " of an entire faction . " The theft of resources , the general incompetence , " the abuse of their children . " Did they beat you , like Marcus eaton 's kid ? They didn 't beat anyone . They 're good people . Right . And that 's why you left ? Was it something I said ? He 's an idiot . Yeah . Yeah . That 's okay . What 's she doing at dauntless ? ( Speaking indistinctly ) Prior . You 're Andrew prior 's daughter , aren 't you ? Beatrice . It 's just tris now . Tris , I like that . Hmm . You made an impressive choice , tris , despite your parents . And your test result . You 've seen my test result ? Of course . I 'm glad you were smart enough to know your own mind . Let me know if you ever need anything . Well , that was weird . Yeah . Al : What do you think is goin ' on ? Will : I bet they 're hunting divergents . That 's all they talk about at erudite these days . Al : Wait . Divergents are real ? Christina : Come on , Al . Eric : First fight . Peter versus tris . Girl : What ? Boy : Uh-oh . It 's Eric . He 's just trying to get back at you . Four : Hey . Tris : What ? Remember what I said about attack ? First shot , right to the throat . And you watch him . He steps before he punches . All right ? Mmm . Peter : All right there , stiff ? Look like you 're about to cry . Might take it easy on you if you cry . Christina : Come on , tris . ( Grunts ) ( Grunts ) ( Peter gasps ) ( Grunts ) ( Groans ) Peter : Get up . Get up . Come on . Stop playin ' with each other . ( Panting ) ( Grunts ) ( Groans ) ( Coughs ) ( Breathing heavily ) Wow . You look ... Look bad . How long have I been here ? About a day . A day ? Have you seen the scoreboard ? Where am I ? You got below the line . Why are you wearing those vests ? War games . Whoa . What are you doing ? I 'm coming . You can 't . Will : Eric says you 're done . What ? He said you 're out . Your father 's on the council , tris . Maybe they 'll make an exception and let you go home . We 're sorry , tris . Will : We gotta go . We 're gonna miss the train . Yeah , okay . Christina : Bye . Tris : Bye . Will : Bye . Tris : Bye . ( Grunts ) Thanks . ( Exhales ) Christina : Hi . Hi . What are you doing here ? Tris : I just figured that I had to make it . Who let you out ? I did . You did ? Okay . Christina : Let 's sit you down . The game 's simple . It 's like capture the flag . Weapon of choice . You call that a gun ? ( Groaning ) Neuro-stim dart . Simulates the pain of a real gunshot wound . Only lasts a couple minutes . Two teams . Four and I are captains . You pick first . Okay . Edward . I 'll take the stiff . Oh . Picking the weak ones so you 've got someone to blame when you lose . Something like that . Christina : Where did Eric 's team go ? Will : They must have gone to the end . All right . Lights off . Gather around . Come on . Okay . What 's your strategy ? We can hide the flag well enough so they can 't find it . Let 's send out a team to scout their location . See if we can find their flag . I say we blitz them . Just beat them with sheer force . Al : Yeah , that 's the best way to lose quickly . Boy : Let 's make them come to us . Ezra : End this quickly , they won 't expect it . Will : We don 't know where they are . Okay , we split into two groups , defense and offense . Ezra : Who put you in charge ? Christina : Someone has to make a decision . Ezra : We need to be more aggressive . Will : We need to be smart about it . ( Arguing continues ) You 're not gonna jump , are you ? No , I 'm just trying to get a good vantage point . Good thinking . You don 't have to come with me . You should go easy . You took a beating . I 'm surprised you noticed . I saw you leave during the fight . Yeah , well , it 's not something I wanted to watch . Four : Hey ! You good ? You okay ? Yeah . I 'm fine . ( Grunting ) This is high enough . No , we need to go higher . You all right ? You 're afraid of heights . Everyone 's afraid of something . I didn 't think you were afraid of anything . Four : Come on , tris . ( Grunting ) Really ? Are you even human ? ( Panting ) This isn 't so bad . Good eye . Look ! ( Chuckles ) There it is . Four : All right . What 's your plan ? Tris : We split into two groups . We 'll go up this side and let the rest of you engage Eric . Boy 1 : I can see ' em . Boy 2 : Go ! Go ! Light ' em up ! ( Groaning ) Boy : There 's two more ! I 'm gonna move in closer ! Follow me . Go ! ( Boy and girl groaning ) Boy : Watch on your right ! Girl : Go , go , go . Go . Christina , let 's go ! Boy : Get ' em , get ' em ! ( Boy groans ) Girl : This way ! Girl : Cover me ! Boy : All right . ( Boy groans ) ( Gasps ) Tell me if this hurts . Tris : You tell me . ( Groans ) You bitch ! Christina : Asshole . ( Groans ) That was awesome ! ( Tris chuckles ) ( Boy groans ) Girl : Get covered ! ( Boy groaning ) ( Groaning ) ( Grunts ) Christina : Go , tris ! I 'll guard . ( Grunting ) ( Yells ) ( Grunts ) ( Groans ) Whoo ! ( All cheering ) Will : Game over ! Al : Good job , tris ! ( Indistinct conversations ) Hey , tris ! Yeah ? Come with us . Where you going ? Shortcut back . A little initiation ritual , dauntless style . ( Excited indistinct conversations ) ( Panting ) Tris : Wow . Boy : All right , let 's do this ! Boy 2 : Good . Boy 1 : All right , you good ? Boy : Hang tight . Girl : Yeah . Go , go ! Fly , baby . Whoo ! You 're up . Boy : All right , do it ! ( Sighs ) Come on , girl . Go for it ! Do it , tris ! Girl : Like flying ! Don 't forget to pull the brake at the bottom ! Tris : Okay . Boy : Go . Boy 1 : You ready ? Boy 2 : Harness is good . ( Screaming ) ( Screaming ) ( Groans ) Pull the brake ! Pull the brake ! ( Breathing heavily ) ( All cheering ) Yeah ! ( Indistinct conversations ) Four : Tris ! Hey . Hey . Congratulations . Thanks . You know , I wanted to say that you were really good tonight . You were brave . Yeah . Anyway , you should get back to your friends . Okay . If you 're ranked above the red line , you 'll move on to the second stage of training . If you 're below it , we 'll waste no more time on you . Here are your rankings . ( All cheering ) Will : Nice . ( Chuckling ) Al : You made it . Christina : You made it , tris . Boy 1 : Got it . Boy 2 : Thank you . ( Indistinct talking ) Here you go . So we pass the first stage of training , and this is our reward . Man : Toss it up ! Glamorous . ( Truck engine starts ) ( Gasps ) Mom ? ( Sighs ) Oh , my girl ! Mom , what are you doing here ? I knew they 'd assign you here sooner or later . Look at you ! God , you 're so strong and beautiful . Mom , you can 't be here . I know , but you 're in danger . What ? I had to ask you something . You weren 't sick the day you took your aptitude test , were you ? Why ? What were your test results ? ( Whispering ) Honey , it 's okay . You can tell me . They were ... They were inconclusive . Divergent ? You can 't tell anyone . You can 't tell your friends , your instructors . You can 't trust anyone . ( Pa system whining ) I 'm not . People have always been so threatened by divergents . But now erudite is looking for them everywhere . They 're actively seeking them out . Why ? ( Whispering ) Mom , what am I ? You don 't conform . Your mind works in a million different ways . They 're scared of you . Stage two of training is where you are most at risk . They 're gonna get inside your head and watch how you respond to fear . But you can pass . You can make it through dauntless . I have seen it before . How do you know so much about this ? About dauntless ? Never mind about me . Do not let them know who you are . Wait ! Wait ! Were you dauntless ? Listen . Guard : Hey ! What are you doing ? Truck 's loaded . Let 's go . ( Groaning ) What did they do to her ? Tris . Take a seat . I 'm going to inject you with a serum that stimulates the part of your brain that processes fear . Great . It induces a hallucination , and then transmitters in the serum allow me to see the images in your mind . You can see inside my mind ? Mmm-hmm . Lay back . ( Groans ) ( Sighs ) Now , you 're gonna be facing your worst fears , tris . Most people have 10 to 15 really bad ones . You have to calm yourself . Slow your heart rate and your breathing , and deal with what 's in front of you . Be brave . ( Breathing heavily ) ( Thunder rumbling ) ( Crows cawing ) ( Panting ) ( Squelching ) ( Grunting ) ( Cawing continues ) ( Groaning ) This isn 't real . ( Muffled groaning ) ( Gasps ) It 's all right , it 's all right . You okay ? ( Gasping ) ( Sighing ) How long do you think you were in the hallucination , tris ? Twenty minutes ? Three . Four times faster than the average . I 've never seen anyone do that well the first time . How did you get rid of the birds ? The image wasn 't clear . Um ... I just went into the water . Well , next time it 'll be a lot easier . I have to do that again ? Yeah , you have to practice several times before the final , but you 're a natural . You got nothing to worry about . Christina : My whole body was covered in these little insects . They were in my ears , and my throat ... I couldn 't breathe . Yeah , I heard about this guy , like two years ago ... So panicked he had a heart attack in his chair and he almost died . What ? Yeah , so we 've got that to look forward to , right ? ( All chuckling ) You didn 't seem to have any problem at all . Me ? No , no , my God , it was awful . Oh , come on . No one even came close to your time . You were amazing . Yeah , what 's amazing is that she 's gonna knock you right out of dauntless . She 's not gonna knock me out of dauntless . Look , she 's gone from being the worst to one of the best . Somebody 's gotta take her place at the bottom . Who 's it gonna be ? You . Do you ever stop talking ? I just want to know how she does it . What 's your trick ? I don 't have a trick . Nobody gets through it that fast . Why don 't you tell us how you do it ? At least tell your friends . What 's he talkin ' about ? Is there some way to make it easier ? No . No , I ... ( Stammers ) I 'm not doing anything . ( Panting ) ( Indistinct conversations ) ( Groans ) ( Whispering indistinctly ) ( Laughing ) Hey ! Hey ! ( Panting ) ( Grunts ) ( Breathing heavily ) ( Gasping ) This isn 't real . ( Gasps ) ( Sighs ) How 'd you do that ? What ? How 'd you break the glass ? ( Sighs ) I don 't know . Just did it . You just did it ? ( Beeping ) What were your test results ? Your aptitude test . Abnegation . I don 't think so . What ? I think you 're lying to me . Why would I lie to you ? I 'm gonna ask you one more time . What were your test results ? Abnegation . Time for you to go . Tris ? Just so you know , dauntless don 't break the glass like that . Tori : My brother was like you . During the second stage , he got good really fast . Last day of the simulations , one of the dauntless leaders came to watch him . Then the next morning , we found his body at the bottom of the chasm . They got rid of him . Who did ? Dauntless leadership . You can 't let them find out about you . And what if they already know ? Then you 're already dead . Beatrice . What are you doing here ? Tris : I 'm in trouble . What happened ? I 'm not gonna make it at dauntless . I don 't fit in there . You have to fit in there . I can 't . ( Stammering ) I 'm just ... I 'm not like them . ( Chuckles ) I mean , who is ? They 're crazy . Maybe I can go back to abnegation . You can 't go back . I know , but ... They 're never gonna let you do that . ( Sighs ) Who ? Erudite . They 're not gonna let abnegation break any more rules . ( Scoffs ) They actually think that they 're running the government now ? They might be soon . Wait . Really ? Erudite should be in charge . Certainly not abnegation . Wait , hold on , Caleb . How can you say that ? It 's what all the other factions want , now that abnegation failed . No . That 's just what they 're telling you here ... It 's true . It 's not true . ( Man shushes ) ( Quietly ) It 's not . There are liars here . There are people who know how to manipulate you . You need to understand that . Beatrice . I think you should go . Faction before blood . Yeah ? Got it . I need you to come with me . ( Grunts ) Jeannie : Stop ! Are you all right ? Yeah , I 'm fine . Please , sit down . Thank you . I 'm glad you came here today . You are ? Are you happy with your new faction ? Yeah . But you came to see your brother . I just ... I just wanted to talk to him . Have you seen your parents ? No . It 's hard to let go . ( Cup clatters ) Faction before blood . It 's an important ideal , but sometimes difficult to fulfill . It goes against our fundamental human nature . But that 's exactly the weakness we need to overcome . You think that human nature is a weakness ? I think human nature is the enemy . It 's human nature to keep secrets , lie , steal . And I wanna eradicate that . That 's how we 'll maintain a stable , peaceful society . You would help me with that , wouldn 't you ? How would I help you ? You 're aware that abnegation is undermining the faction system and breaking laws harboring divergents ? I didn 't know that . ( Clears throat ) But if that 's true , then I 'm glad that I left . See , I need to know that I can count on you to enforce the law , even if it 's been broken by someone close to you . Someone you care about . Of course . Then I 'll have my car take you back to dauntless . ( Door opens ) ( Door closes ) ( Muffled screaming ) ( Grunting ) Man : Come on ! Get her over ! Come on , do it ! Do it ! Four : Hey ! ( Grunts ) ( Groans ) ( Men groaning ) You all right ? Yeah . Come on . Let 's go . Here , put this on . Thank you . You 'll be safe here . ( Sighs ) ( Basin clatters ) ( Gasps ) Sorry . It 's okay . I can 't believe Al ... You 're moving up through the ranks , and he 's failing . It makes him hate himself and it makes him hate you . He 's just afraid . Everyone 's afraid . I know , but fear does something strange to people like Al . But not you . Fear doesn 't shut you down , it wakes you up . I 've seen it . You should lie down . Get some sleep . Yeah . I 'll take the floor . How you feeling ? Better . Good . ( Tapping ) Where 'd you go yesterday ? To see my brother . It 's getting a little boring for you here , is it ? My brother said that ... He thinks erudite is planning to overthrow abnegation . Do you think they could do that ? Yeah , I do . I think it 's possible . Depends how far they 're willing to go . I 'm worried about my parents . Yeah . But I think you got other things you need to worry about . Don 't you ? Yeah . I should go . ( Footsteps recede ) ( Indistinct conversations ) Christina : Hi . Hey . Is that your sweater ? No . So what happened to you last night ? Al : Tris , can I talk to you for a second ? Listen , I just wanted to say that I 'm sorry . I don 't know what 's wrong with me . Please , can you ever forgive me ? If you ever come close to me again , I will kill you . Tris ... You need to stay away from me ! You are a coward . I just can 't believe he would do that . It 's not like him at all . Will : What 's that ? Boy 1 : Come on . ( All grunting ) ( Gasps ) Oh , my God ! Boy 2 : Guess he just jumped . ( Gasps ) Tris . Tris ! Leave me alone . I 'm sorry about Al . It 's my fault that he 's dead . No , it 's not because of you . He made his own choice . He would have been factionless . He was not gonna pass that final test . Tris : Neither am I. Why do you say that ? You know why . And as soon as all the others find out , they 're gonna kill me . I 'm not gonna let that happen . Shut the door . You 're gonna practice . In my fear landscape ? No . In mine . Have you ever done this before ? No , I haven 't . You sure you want to ? Why wouldn 't I ? I don 't know . You haven 't told me anything about yourself and now you 're just gonna let me inside of your head ? Are you afraid of that ? You 're not ? No . ( Panting ) Fear of heights . I 'm not surprised . It 's not real . No . We could just jump . Divergent would jump . Dauntless would get to that building . If you want to pass , if you want to avoid discovery , you have to do everything the way a dauntless would do it . You have to find some tool , some method to survive . ( Door closing ) ( Four groans ) Fear of confinement . You have to find a way of stopping it . What would a dauntless do ? Good ! ( Grunts ) Take your time . I 'm just enjoying myself in this shrinking box . ( Panting ) As a dauntless soldier , you have to follow orders you don 't always agree with . Who is she ? She 's an innocent . I have to kill her . But I can never do it . Unless I look away . ( Gunshot ) ( Four breathing heavily ) Why are we in abnegation ? Your last fear is your worst fear . It lives in the deepest part of your mind . Marcus had a son . What was his name ? Tobias . Marcus : Tobias . Tobias ... ( Echoing ) Tobias ... Tobias ... I 'm just trying to help you to be better . Tris : No ! ( Gasps ) ( Panting ) ( Sighs ) Four ? Four fears ? Four then , four now . I keep going in there , but I don 't think you ever lose them . Can I ask you something ? Sure . What 's your tattoo ? You wanna see it ? It 's amazing . Tris : The factions . Why do you have all of them ? I don 't want to be just one thing . I can 't be . I want to be brave and I want to be selfless ... Intelligent and honest and kind . Although I 'm still working on " kind . " I don 't wanna go too fast . It 's okay . I 've already got my spot on the floor . ( Chuckles ) Tris : Morning . Hey . Come on . I 'm gonna show you something . Okay . Look . Erudite . Yeah . They 're here every morning . I 've been watching them for weeks . What are they doing at dauntless ? Loading in supplies . Computers . And these . Tris : What is it ? I think it 's some kind of cognitive transmitter . You inject it like a serum . Why ? It 's supposed to make you more susceptible to suggestion , but as many as they have , they could create an army . Man : ( On pa ) Attention , all initiates report for final testing . All initiates report for final testing . You 're ready . You can do this . They can see your hallucinations on the screen . So you get past your fears the way a dauntless would , but do it quickly . Right . If I 'm too good , then they 'll kill me , and if I 'm too slow , then I 'll die . Right . Good luck . Good luck , tris . Hope you make it . ( Cawing ) ( Panting ) ( Grunting ) ( Panting ) Four : Congratulations . Whoa . Four ! Stop ! Four ! Aren 't you dauntless ? ( Grunts ) ( Gasps ) ( Audience applauds ) Please tell me that you weren 't watching that . Would you feel better if I said no ? You did well . Now ... One final test . You know what to do . What ? If you want to be dauntless . No . Do it . ( Gasps ) ( Panting ) Four : You all right ? That looked good to me , okay ? Come on . Let 's go . Congratulations , new members of dauntless . ( All cheering ) All : ( Chanting ) Dauntless ! Dauntless ! Dauntless ! ( All speaking excitedly ) Female leader : Come on . Get in line . Male leader : All right , everybody , line up . What 's going on ? Man : ( On pa ) All dauntless initiates , report to your command leader . Eric : All right , listen up ! Before you leave tonight , I want you all in four lines . Everyone gets a tracking device . Don 't ask questions . It 's just a precaution . Do you see four ? Christina : No . Woman : Next ! Will : What 's going on ? Oh , my God . Congratulations . You should be first in line , but ... I 'll make it easy for you . Eric : Hurts like a bitch , huh ? Now you 're really one of us . ( Door opening ) Hey , what 's ... Man : ( On pa ) Faction before blood . Oh , my God . Max : They can see and hear us . They just don 't process it the same way . Commands come in through the transmitter . What 's goin ' on ? What are we doin ' ? Divergent . Eric : Hey ! Everything 's fine . There 's nothing to worry about . ( Gunshot ) ( Thudding ) ( Gasps ) ( Sighs ) ( Siren wailing ) Man : Hurry up ! Move ! ( Glass shatters ) ( Woman screams ) Man : ( On pa ) Abnegation leaders must identify themselves . We need to find my parents . ( Arguing indistinctly ) ( Gunshot ) ( Woman screams ) Just keep moving . Where 's your house ? Man : ( On pa ) We are looking for information . All houses will be searched . Do not resist . You will not be hurt . Tris : Mom ? Dad ? Where would they have gone ? I don 't know . Woman : This can 't happen here ! Just stop it ! Man : ( On pa ) Do not resist . All abnegation will be questioned . The legendary four ... A mindless drone . You were first in your class . Now you 're ... Nothing . What ? Think he might be ... There 's one way to find out . Eric : Say goodbye , asshole . Goodbye . Move and you die ! The stiff ? ( Chuckling ) Two stiffs . Eric : Two dead stiffs . You can 't let a single divergent slip through . This is what happens . She 's not gonna shoot me . Think you might be overestimating my character . ( Gunshot ) ( Groans ) Four : Run ! ( Groans ) ( Gunshot ) You were hit ? Yeah . Right there ! Don 't move ! Max : Drop your weapons . ( Man announcing indistinctly on pa ) Tobias eaton . And you , Beatrice . I thought it was intellect I was sensing in you . Maybe you 're not as smart as you think you are . Why are you attacking all these innocent people ? Innocent people ? Abnegation , if left unchecked , will destroy the faction system . Same can be said of both of you . Somebody has to stop you . If we don 't , peace will be lost . It 's already been lost . You destroyed it . Human nature destroyed it . Those of us with the vision to see that are called upon to protect the rest . We will restore the peace . And this time , it will last . And what if you 're wrong ? Bring him with us . ( Groans ) ( Clicks tongue ) She 's injured . Any results would be unclear . You can get rid of her . Soldier : All right . ( Groaning ) Get down ! ( Sighs ) Soldier : Let 's go . Come on ! Man : ( On pa ) Additional security teams , report to mobile command level 5 . ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshots continue ) Beatrice ! Mom ? Mom ! Beatrice . Okay . Okay , we gotta run ! You were dauntless . Served me well today . Is dad okay ? Yeah . He led a group over to Monroe and state . We 're gonna meet him there . ( Yelling indistinctly ) Let 's go ! ( Gunshots firing ) Soldier : Copy 1-9 ! ( Panting ) ( Firing continues ) Will ! Will ! Will ! Will , stop ! Stop ! Tris : Stop ! ( Gunshot ) I ... Okay . Come on , honey . We gotta go . I killed him . I killed him . I killed him . Come here . Okay . Let 's go find your father . Cover me . No . I 'll go . Got it , sir ! ( Yelps ) Natalie : Don 't stop ! Don 't stop ! Go ! ( Gunshots firing ) ( Groans ) You okay ? Good . Yeah , I 'm good . Okay ! Let 's go ! We 're good . Mom ? Mom ... what is it ? Hey ... Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom ! Mom , no ! Mom ! Mom ! ( Sobbing ) Mom ? Mom ! Mom , wake up ! Mom ! Oh , my God , mom ! ( Gunshots continue ) Stop ! Stop ! ( Sobbing ) I love you , mom ... Oh , my God ! ( Panting ) ( Sobbing ) Tris : Where 's my father ? Andrew : Beatrice ? ( People whispering indistinctly ) Your mother ? She saved me . ( Sniffles ) She saved me . Then it wasn 't in vain . We need to leave here . Are there soldiers outside ? No , it 's clear . I should have believed you . I left as soon as I realized . Why is this happening ? I don 't understand . Why are dauntless fighting for erudite ? They don 't know what they 're doing . They 're under simulation . We need to wake ' em up . I need to get into dauntless . Marcus : That 's a fortress . It 's not gonna happen . I can get us in there . Tris : Get ready . What now ? You 're not gonna like it . There 's a net at the bottom . Don 't think , just jump . ( Groans ) ( Panting ) Are you good ? Good ? Let 's go . Wait here . Against the wall . Against the wall ! How are you awake ? Because I 'm smarter than you . And they need me . Where are they controlling it from ? Why would I tell you that ? It 's not like you 're gonna shoot me . Why do people keep saying that ? ( Gunshot ) ( Screams ) ( Groans ) Where are they controlling it from ? Did you really need to shoot him ? Every minute we waste , another abnegation dies and another dauntless becomes a murderer . Tris : Peter , let 's go . That 's it , isn 't it ? Yeah . I 've seen jeanine go in there . That 's where she 's controlling it from . Like you said , there isn 't a second to waste . Dad , no ! ( Gunshots firing ) Dad ... Man : Do whatever it takes ... ( Gunfire continues ) Man : Hey ! ( Groans ) ( Grunts ) Watch Caleb . I 'm going in there . ( People chatting indistinctly ) Hey . Hi . ( Grunts ) Four ... Four ... four , it 's me . You 're in a SIM . He can 't hear you . Amazing , isn 't it ? Everything we think of that makes up a person , thoughts , emotions , history ... All wiped away by chemistry . Four . He 's gone . And we 're all safer for it . Safer ? How are we safer ? The brilliance of the faction system is that conformity to the faction removes the threat of anyone exercising their independent will . Divergents threaten that system . Don 't get me wrong . There 's a certain beauty in your resistance , your defiance of categorization . But it 's a beauty we can 't afford . Four , it 's me . It 's me . Please , four , look at me . Look at me . ( Grunts ) ( Both grunting ) Four ! It 's me ! ( Groaning ) Four , stop ! Stop ! Stop ... Four ... please ... It 's okay , it 's okay . I love you . It 's okay . It 's okay . I love you . It 's okay . Four , look at me . Look at me . ( Whispering ) It 's me . It 's me . It 's me . It 's me . ( Panting ) Tris ... Go . Finish it . ( Erudites clamoring ) ( Sirens blaring ) ( Groans ) ( Groans ) Help ! Man : Hey ! Shut it down . No . ( Gunshots ) I am not gonna ask you again . Do it ! Shut it down ! I admire you willing to die for what you believe ... But so am I. You can 't do it , can you ? ( Siren wailing ) ( Sobbing ) Maybe you 're not quite as dauntless as you thought you were . You 're right . I 'm not . I 'm divergent . ( Groans ) Now shut it down and wipe the program . ( Panting ) Woman : ( On pa ) Simulation abort . ( Beeping ) System-wide shutdown . Jeanine : No ... no ... No ! ( Grunts ) Don 't get me wrong . There 's a certain beauty to your resistance . ( Grunts angrily ) Four : Tris ... Woman : ( On pa ) Lockdown now in effect . Max : All right , let 's move ! We gotta go . Now . Tobias . We need to keep moving . All right , move ! Son ! I got it ! I know you do . Tris : My mom and dad died today . They 're gone . Four : I know . But they loved you , tris . For them , there was no better way to show you . ( Sniffles ) Now we have nothing . We have no home , no faction ... I don 't even know who I am anymore . I know exactly who you are . You sure about that ? Yeah , I 'm very sure . Come here . Tris : We 're like the factionless now . We 've left everything behind , but we found ourselves and each other . Tomorrow we may have to fight again , but , for now , we 'll ride the train to the end of the line ... And then we 'll jump .

 Yes , I 'm listening , fuck . It 's not " Nem " , it 's " Nam " . Namgoong Minsoo , you shit . Namgoong is my name , my surname is Minsoo , asshole . What for ? And if I refuse ? Would you like a puff , asshole ? It 's too good for a shit like you . Wake up ! My daughter , Yona . To go forward , we need her . For each gate , I want two pieces of Kronol . It 's my fault ? Of course , I do it only for the Kronol . You 're the one who 's giving me some . Don 't open ! We 're getting closer to the Yekaterina bridge ! We 're getting closer . What are you waiting for ? Run . Shit . Don 't look . Counselor , is everything alright ? Yes , everything is fine . Is it edible ? A child of the train wouldn 't know about this . I grew up walking on this . That 's what we find under the snow . Dirt . What 's that ? It moves . Under the ground . What 's that ? LA VIE DE WILFORD Look , do you see that ? What ? You see that woman , in front ? She was the maid in the front wagon . An Inuit . An Eskimo , actually . She knew everything about the ice and the snow . She believed she could survive outside . Hurry ! He 's coming . The door ! Have some too . Kronol first ! Are you going insane , or what ? You got a problem with the gates ? Here , have a cigarette . You should be grateful . That 's the world 's last cigarette . You tail section hick . It 's a beautiful story , Curtis . But I do not want to open that door . Do you know what I want ? I want to open one door . But not this one . That one . The one that leads to the outside . We 've been sentenced for 18 years . Everyone thinks it 's a wall . But it 's a fucking door . Let 's open it and get out of here . We don 't know . But maybe we can survive . You remember the Yekaterina bridge ? When we got massacred with axes . Every New Year , I check something . We see the wreckage of a plane . Under the snow . Ten years ago , the tail was barely visible . But now I can see the fuselage and the wings . There 's less and less snow and ice . It 's melting . The snow is becoming more fragile , it won 't take much for everything to collapse . Recently , do you know what I saw ? Outside , there was ... Never mind . It 's not worth telling you about it . You don 't think I 'm right . The Kronol is above all ... a highly flammable chemical . One spark and boom ! Basically , it 's a fucking bomb . I don 't only store it to get high , but to blow up this door . The matches , quickly . Give it to me ! Fire ! Blood ! Are you alright ? What happened to you ? Get down . Yona . We must open this door . You see those cables ? There are many . Yona . The red one , number 8 . No , 7 . Yona , the Kronol ! Yona , stop ! No . Stick the Kronol on the door . It 's done ! Curtis has the matches . Only one left .

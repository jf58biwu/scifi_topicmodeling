 Molly : I went to space on a 13-month solo mission . My husband created a lifelike android called a humanich . His name is ethan . He 's the prototype . This is a story about earth . Ethan ! A story about family . A story about surviving . Previously on extant : Turn around , hands in the air ! Shh . He 's sleeping . Show her to me . Kryger reached out to me last night . He broke into the isea . I don 't Know what he took . Why are you telling me all this ? Tell sparks , he 'll know what to do . Alan . Ethan : It 's my nightmare . Where did you see it ? On your belly . Kern : Absalom . Dose and a half . Man : He 's out . Sparks : He stole the aruna transmission file . I tried decoding it , but it wasn 't isea code . ( electric hum ) This is katie sparks From the aruna station . The virus has entered the ship . Uh ... Dad , I 'm gonna die up here . She was pregnant , too . He knew what was up there , And he sent me anyway . Capsule is 200 meters out . Range rate : 0.05 . Ben , you know what to do . Ben : Copy . Initiating final approach . ( loud crash ) ( grunts ) ( alarm walls ) meteor collision . Functional cargo blocked . Escape vehicle damaged . Rapid oxygen loss . Leak detected . T-res to bingo pressure ? Two minutes , 15 seconds . Initiate de-press protocol . Shutting imv valves . Securing the hatches Fore and aft ! Equalizing available atmosphere . Ben ! If we isolated the leak , why is the alarm still ... ? ( high-pitched buzzing ) aah ! My ears ! We 're losing pressure ! Damn it , ben , you said You shut the imv valve ! The meteor collision must have caused a system malfunction . Enter manual override code . Okay . Come on . T-res one minute . Come on . Don oxygen mask . Aah ! Damn it , come on ! T-res 30 seconds . 29 , 28 ... Come on ! Twenty-s ... Leak isolated . Oxygen reserves active . Nice work , molly . That was a close one . Yeah , I 'll say . Seriously ? A broken oxygen mask ? ( applause ) I know we got to be ready for anything , but come on . Nice , molly . May I have your attention . ( voice breaking ) : This evening , at 6 : 54 p.M ... . Mission specialist derek pearce received a distress call From the aruna station , Reporting an oxygen fire . Several minutes after the initial comm , An onboard explosion Disabled all contact Between mission control And the aruna crew . At this time we believe ... We believe there are no survivors . Go home . Be with your families . We 'll provide more details As they become available . Alan . Alan . Oh , god . I 'm so sorry about katie . If there 's anything I can do , I ... There 's nothing anyone can do . Katie : Whatever you do , Do not recover the ship . I repeat- - Do not recover the ship . Sparks knew about this . He knew this happened To his very own daughter . And he sent me Up there anyway . Do you think he knew katie was pregnant ? She didn 't even know she was pregnant . But he knew something was up there . And he sent me on a fishing expedition . And then you come back pregnant . That 's how I know it 's still alive . Think about it , sam . Why would they go through all this trouble Just to abort the baby ? They 're keeping it somewhere , and when I find it , I 'm gonna be able to prove what they did to me . What sparks did to me . Molly , they took that baby out of your body Without leaving any physical evidence . I don 't know how you expect to be able to find it now . I 'm not going to find it . Sparks is gonna tell me exactly where it is . But why ? We can 't even prove that he saw the aruna video . But somebody can . Derek pearce . He was the aruna mission specialist . He would have been the one to receive katie 's distress call . And you think that he 'll admit that sparks Was behind this entire cover-up ? If he wants to save himself . I 'm gonna need your help . Anything . Okay . Go through the entire Aruna crew 's medical history . There had to be some major anomalies in the scans , The tether scores , something . Sparks would have had to sign off on anything unusual . You know if I go through those records , he 's gonna find out . Good . I want him to know I 'm up to something . I want him to lose sleep at night . Why ? I want to make him sweat . Evening , sir . Sparks : Everything go as planned ? Not exactly . But I managed to locate the target . And ? Harmon kryger won 't be causing us any more trouble . Were you able to recover the aruna file ? No , sir . But I am working on a strong lead . ( electric humming ) John : Morning . Morning . Did you get any sleep ? ( exhales ) Every time I closed my eyes , all I could see was ... Katie sparks . ( electric whoosh ) Ethan : Are you ready yet ? I don 't want to be late . School doesn 't start for an hour , e . We got plenty of time . First day back . He 's nervous . Mm . I don 't blame him . I mean , After all he 's been through since his shutdown ? Well , that 's exactly why he needs to go back . Ethan needs to spend some time around normal kids With a normal life . What 's that ? This ... Is normal life . Look . A surprise for ethan . It 's being delivered Later . Ethan : Are you ready yet ? In a minute , kiddo . ( soft laugh ) Are you going to see derek pearce today ? Yup . The sooner he starts talking , The sooner sparks nightmare begins . And ours ends . Hey . It has to end . Yeah . Search " aruna . " I need the medical records from the final mission . ( electric whirring , beeping ) ( clacking ) Where 's the aruna file ? ( clack ) ( muffled speaking ) I cou ... I could ... I couldn 't open it . So where is it ? Why would I keep it if I ... If I couldn 't open it ? Verdisign : Visitor . ( door chimes ) Back door . ( muffled grunting ) Mom . What are you doing here ? Well , I tried calling , and when you didn 't call back , I ... May I come in ? Of course . ¶ ( beeps softly ) May I help you ? Derek . Molly woods , from the isea . I 'm wondering if maybe we can talk ? About the aruna ? Molly , uh ... Uh , I 'm kind of tied up right now . It 'll just take a second . I really can 't . Sorry . Okay . I 'm sorry . I didn 't know he spoke japanese . Neither did I. Hey . Where 'd you learn to do that ? I don 't know . ( knocking at door ) ( beeps , door opens ) I wanted to thank you . Apparently , your information about molly 's meeting With harmon kryger proved quite useful . Did it ? That 's good . I 'm glad to know you 're on board . On board ? Well , that you can be trusted To act in the best interest of this organization . And in your own best interest . Which , really , are one And the same , Considering what 's at stake . Considering that , Yes . One more thing : I noticed you were looking into the aruna astronauts Medical records . Why is that ? Molly asked for them . And you gave them to her ? You said you wanted her to trust me again . What did she want them for ? I really don 't know , sir . Find out . And in the future , if molly asks you for anything , Anything at all , You 're to run it by me first . Understood ? Understood . What ? No , it 's not our second date . Please , if you think picking me up At the gym counts as a first date , There 's not gonna be a second one . Surprise me . Odin ? Maybe . You okay ? I 'm fine . Why ? God , your pupils have turned Into cartoon hearts . Shut up . They 're just beating right out Of your sockets . Cartoon ... I think you know Where you can shove that . " surprise me . " Can anyone here tell me how ethan suddenly speaks japanese ? What ? This morning , I dropped him off at school , and he heard Two japanese girls talking about him . And he talked back in japanese . All right , little man 's on fire . But the question is , What 's fueling that fire ? Well , his neural net 's programmed to basic japanese . Yeah , but that 's not nearly enough to explain this . Linguistically , it 's-it 's like saying ethan had a stepladder And-and used it to reach the moon . But maybe he doesn 't see it As linguistic but mathematical , Like translation as code-breaking . Yeah , he is good at that . Maybe I was wrong . Maybe that school is good for ethan . But at this rate , Pretty soon he 'll be smarter than all of his teachers . Well , I mean , so was I. I turned out pretty good . But we designed Ethan to-to learn At the same rate as his peers . We sent him to school to learn like other kids , To-to learn to be like other kids . And other kids don 't just start speaking japanese Without being taught . Be cool if they did , though . No , It would be terrifying . It wouldn 't be human . I don 't get it . I built ethan . I-I thought I understood everything about him . Molly : Gina , Look up the purchase price of ... Derek pearce 's apartment . Seems a bit pricy for an ex-mission specialist . Especially one without a pension . That property was purchased for exactly one dollar . What ? One dollar ? Well , that can 't be . Check again . Derek pearce . Grand avenue . Penthouse a . He bought it for one dollar . Multiple property records confirm . From who ? Previous owner was claypool industries . Sending you a full purchase history now . Okay , well , according to this , Claypool industries bought the property for $ 5.2 million , And then six days later pearce bought it for one dollar . So claypool bought the property and then put it In pearce 's name . Gina , look up claypool industries . One listing . Claypool industries mining and ore . No current address . Why would a mining company buy a luxury apartment For derek pearce ? I 'm guessing that 's a rhetorical question . You could say that . ( chuckles ) Gina , compose e-mail . To derek pearce . Subject : What is claypool industries ? Message send . Incoming v-chron from john . Open . So , uh , hey . This might seem weird , but did you , by any chance , Teach ethan to speak japanese ? Uh , no . I only know a few words from my time on the I.S.S. Why ? Long story short , ethan speaks japanese . Out of nowhere . Charlie put it in the lab report , And now yasumoto wants to see it for himself . At dinner . Tonight . With the three of us . Seriously ? Sorry . ( sighs ) Okay . Thank you . I 'll see you later . Gina , compose e-mail . Derek pearce . Subject : What is this ? Message send . New message . Open . Kern 's mother : I 'm concerned , gordon . You haven 't answered my calls . You look awful . Your house is a mess . Are you using again ? What ? No . No , I 'm just ... Working a lot . That 's what your dad said before ... He was exactly your age when he got sick , You know . I 'm not sick . Maybe neither was he . What ? Kern : Mom , what if dad wasn 't crazy ? What if he was right ? Right ? What he did cost Him and us everything . I don 't mean what he did . I mean what he believed . That the voice of god was speaking To him , telling him to land A commercial airliner in the middle Of a cornfield , hundreds of miles Off course ? He was sick , gordon . He was very , very sick . It 's a miracle that people weren 't killed . Kern : A miracle , huh ? Maybe god was up there With him . Please . There 's more in heaven and earth than can be dreamt of In our philosophy . There 's no shame in it . Not in being sick . But if there were something wrong and you didn 't admit it , That would be a shame . I 'm fine . I 'm just worn out . Okay . I 'll go . I 'll let you get some rest . But promise me this : That if you do need help , you 'll ask for it . Gina : Dr. Barton arriving . Sam . Hey . I found something in the aruna records . Okay , but I 'm on my way out . Pearce agreed to meet me . Molly , you got to see this . I checked The crew members brain scans . At first glance , they all look completely normal . Okay , on second glance ? They 're all Exactly the same . Somebody must 've substituted the same scan Across the board . But they didn 't touch the tethers , So look at this . The naphthalene levels Were elevated to a man- - or a woman in katie 's case . Naphthalene ? We started testing for it After astronauts on the first mining missions Started coming back with hemolytic anemia . But the aruna wasn 't a mining mission . Well , it wasn 't supposed to be . Wait a minute . Pearce 's apartment was bought by A mining company , Claypool industries . Maybe buying his silence is what put them out of business . Why would they cover up the mining ? The isea partners With mining missions all the time . Because they didn 't want anybody to know What they were searching for . It must be pretty valuable . Not compared to what they found . Excuse me . Excuse me . Ma 'am , I 'm gonna have to ask you to step back . What happened ? A jumper From the penthouse . You 're sure there 's nothing you 're not telling me . You didn 't learn japanese From a book or a translation app Or something ? Maybe it came from the secret part of me . What ? The part that belongs only to me . ( door shuts ) there you are . We 'd better get going . I don 't want to be late to yasumoto 's . Okay , ethan . Go to the car . W-we 're gonna meet you there . What 's wrong ? What did pearce say ? He 's dead . I think they killed him . What ? You mean because you were asking Questions ? What-what happened ? He jumped . Or else he was pushed . Oh , god , john , I 'm scared . Th-this has to stop . That video 's enough to bring sparks down . But maybe it 's not . They made me look like I was crazy once . They can do that again . And putting yourself in danger Like this , putting all of us in danger , That doesn 't seem crazy to you ? We-we can 't do this any longer . It 's too risky . Yeah , I know it 's risky . But no risk , no reward . Come on . Ethan 's waiting . ( hissing ) ( grunts ) ( exhales ) Drink it . It 's just Water . ( grunts , exhales ) There 's more in heaven and earth . Damn right there is . I 've seen it . ( exhales ) You 've seen it , too , Haven 't you ? It 's hard to forget , huh ? I 'm sure the absalom will help , For a while . You don 't know me . I know that you let sparks think That you killed me . I know the fact That you haven 't means that you 've got doubts . Watch it . Real doubts . About sparks . About what he did to molly and to me . About what he 's asking you to do . I said watch it ! Damn it ! ( huffing ) ¶ Hello again . Hello . Um ... You met ethan . And , uh , this is my wife molly . Hello . Hi . Come in . Please . Molly , this is , uh , femi dodd . She 's a board member At yasumoto corp . The first time we met , I , uh ... I called her an idiot . Hidecki : John . Welcome . Thank you . I-if I 'd known You two were , uh ... I definitely wouldn 't have called you an idiot . Apology accepted . You must be molly . Mr. Yasumoto . I 've heard so much about you . And I about you . ( quiet laugh ) ( laughs ) The possibilities are limitless . No ? Well , I 'm not sure I 'd say " limitless . " But making sense of the independent activity In ethan 's brain could be a huge step Toward understanding the nature of human consciousness . Right ? Not to mention A potential path to immortality . I-immortality ? I don 't understand . I think mr . Yasumoto is referring to the theory That once the neural pathways are fully decoded , It would be possible to copy a human brain And upload it to a humanich 's body . So it 's possible , then ? Theoretically , but ... Just because we can do it does not mean we should do it . For once , I agree with ms . Dodd . And anyway , To suggest that understanding ethan 's cognitive leaps Is akin to understanding human consciousness , It 's not just premature , it 's-it 's wrong . After all , human beings Can 't learn a language in a single day , So ethan shouldn 't be able to , either . I-I think We should install some sort of governing mechanism . What ? Slow down his development . But that goes against everything You 've ever said . So you think ethan 's Progress should be allowed To continue ? Well , I don 't know . But I do know that we 're not gods . We 're just parents . And all we can do is give him the best of ourselves . And then whatever happens Happens , right ? We just have to wait and see . To " wait and see " Is to expose ethan to needless risk . Well , no risk , no reward . Yeah , it was tough when I was young , but ... These days the supers are so good , it 's ... I hardly even notice anymore . Yeah , well , I wish I could say the same . Well , it 's still new . It 'll get easier . So you 're not- - I don 't know ... Resentful ? Honestly , I 'm ... I 'm almost grateful . If it wasn 't for my legs , I wouldn 't have started designing prosthetics , Or gotten involved in the humanichs project . You love your work , huh ? Well , some days more than others . Yeah ? Today wasn 't One of those days ? It 's just my boss . He 's like ... Threatened by progress all of a sudden . You know what I mean ? Yeah . Yeah , I do . And he lets his personal feelings Cloud his professional judgment , Which drives me insane . Sorry , we don 't have to talk About my dumb office drama . Oh , no , it 's okay . No . I like it . I 'd like to talk more about it actually . Really ? Sure . I mean , take Ethan . How do you guys ... How do you guys control him ? We don 't . Especially not lately . Actually the goal is to try To get him to start thinking for himself . So , you 're saying that someday He could have complete free will ? Can you imagine ? ( both chuckling ) We have to talk . Not now . Now ! Pearce is dead . You could be next . If this is about Taking sparks down , you have what you need . It 's time to go public with the aruna video And let the chips fall where they may . It 's about more than that . I want to see it . See what ? The baby . What ? Whatever it is , john , It 's half mine . It was inside of me . Not you . Me . I brought it here . And every indication is it 's still alive . I don 't believe this . And if it 's out there ... I 'm gonna find it . Dad ? I 'm gonna die up here . ( crying ) : I just want ... ( banging ) Whatever you do ... Do not recover the ship . I repeat . Do not recover the ship ! What kind of father sends his daughter Into harm 's way like that , alan ? And then lies and covers The whole thing up ? I know the aruna was a secret mining mission . And that claypool bought pearce an apartment to keep him quiet . How much did they give you ? Well , enough to get pearce killed , I guess , right ? What was his life worth ? And what about my baby ? How much did you get for that ? Careful , molly . You 're out of your depth here . What about katie 's baby ? Yeah . She was pregnant when she died . Just like I was . Guess you 're the one out of your depth here , alan . What do you want ? I want to know where my baby is . I don 't know . But I can find it . No . I 'll find it . I got this far all by myself . Before you go to bed tonight Get down on your knees and pray For katie 's forgiveness . Tonight and every night for the rest Of your life . It 's not nearly gonna be enough . But it 's gonna be worth a try . ( computer dings ) Hey , wha-what are you doing up ? Did julie adjust your sleep cycle ? No . I just woke up . Is that for me ? Yeah . Will you teach me to ride it ? Sure , sure . We 're gonna take it For a spin in the morning . No . Now . Ethan , it 's dark out . We 'll-we 'll , We 'll wait for morning . Please ? Well , screw it . Let 's go . Yes ! ( beeps ) Do you want to come in ? Next time . John : Okay , I 'm gonna hold on To help you balance , but steering , pedaling- - That 's all you , okay ? You think you can handle it ? Yup . This is how my dad taught me , and I fell a lot . But I didn 't give up . Okay ? Okay . Remember ... Keep your eyes straight ahead . Not down on the ground , okay ? Dad , let go . What ? Let go . ( giggling ) Are you okay ? Yeah . Did you want to teach me more ? No . No . I mean , I-I did , but , uh ... I just want to watch you ride now . Ethan ? Ethan ! Ethan ! What 's wrong ? You can 't go off On your own like that . Sorry . Come on , let 's-let 's go back inside . It 's late . We must prepare ourselves For the battle ahead . There will be violence . Casualties . But I , for one , am ready to fight for a better world . That 's what I thought I was fighting for overseas . And then ... Then the drone strikes began . See , I lost my arm In combat , but ... My opponent wasn 't on the battlefield . Uh-uh . He- - or she- - Was sat in a nice , little air-conditioned room Thousands of miles away , Pushing buttons and watching The carnage unfold on-screen ! When we outsource war To machines , We outsource our humanity To technology . ( sighs ) We have ... Lost our souls to machines . We talk of making a difference , But so far that 's all it 's been : Talk . Power outages and rolling blackouts ... These half-measures are wholly ineffective . We need more . We need a reckoning . Starting right here . ( door opens ) Sorry I 'm late . Actually , your timing is perfect . Can I help you ? Yeah , um , I 'd like to go To claypool industries ? Oh . Gone . I-I know it 's late , I 'm sorry , but ... No , no . I mean , They 're gone . The fifth floor 's Been empty since I started here . Okay , well , you know what ? Uh , the thing is , um ... I told my boss that I would take a look At all the empty offices , And he 's expecting a full report from me First thing in the morning . So ... Do you think I could take just a quick little peek upstairs ? I 'm really not supposed to leave my post . I know . I know you 're not . But I would be so grateful if you did . ( sighs ) Okay , come on . Thank you . ¶ ( electronic hum ) Katie . Katie , it 's me . Please , katie . Please forgive me . ( sniffs ) You gotta believe me . ( sniffs ) I ... I had no idea . ( exhales ) I 'm sorry . Oh , katie , I 'm so sorry . Katie : Dad ? Katie ... All righty . Here we are . Take your time ; look around . I gotta get back downstairs . Thanks . All right . Security breach . Code black . Threat currently isolated on five ; requesting backup . Hi , daddy . ( alarm beeping ) Verdisign : Security breach , code black . Fifth floor . Repeat : Security breach , Code black , fifth floor . ( grunts ) ( grunting ) Aah ! ( groans ) No ! You 've made a mistake ! I can help you . Yeah ? ( grunts ) And how are you gonna help me ? You don 't know what you 've unleashed . I do . You think it was the hand of god Reaching down ? You 're wrong ! I 've seen it ! And it felt A hell of a lot more like it was reaching up . Verdisign : Phone call from director sparks . ( grunts ) One word , and this is all over . You understand ? Put him through . ( verdisign chimes ) Yes , sir ? Sparks : Get down here . Molly woods is in the building . Have security forces been mobilized ? Yes . ¶ ( overlapping chatter ) ¶ ( thud ) ( twittering ) Come on , go . ¶ ( gasps ) ( grunting ) I ... ( muffled scream ) Shh . It 's me . ( moans ) ( alarm whooping ) you can go with them Or you can come with me . Your choice . Back . Shh . Here . You take her . Wait , wait ! No ! Take her ! No ! Wait ! Not this ! No , wait , wait , wait ! Wait , wait , wait ! Let 's go . ( grunts ) Move , move , move ! Get in the car . Move ! Kryger ? Go , go , go . ( tires squeal ) ( sighs ) Hey . It 's me . ( sighs ) Oh , god ... I wish I could talk to you . Listen , I 'm sorry . It 's just , uh ... I can 't control much right now , But I can still control ethan . And I have to go in and slow him down . It 's for his own protection . I hope you 'll understand . ( sighs ) I love you . ( typing ) Captioning sponsored by cbs Captioned by media access group at wgbh access.Wgbh.Org

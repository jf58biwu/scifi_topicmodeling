 I was born in space . I 've never felt the sun on my face or breathed real air or floated in the water . None of us have . For three generations , the Ark has kept what 's left of the human race alive . But now our home is dying , and we are the last hope of mankind , one hundred prisoners sent on a desperate mission to the ground . Each of us is here because we broke the law . On the ground , there is no law . All we have to do is survive , but we will be tested by the earth , by the secrets it hides , and , most of all , by each other . Previously on The 100 ... Ark Station , please come in . We need you . Are you saying there are survivors on the ground ? Yes . The earth is survivable . The Grounder saved Octavia 's life , and Bellamy brought him back here and tortured him . My name is Lincoln . Let 's go . With the Grounder escaping , we should expect retaliation . We are going to the ground , but not all of us are . There are 2,237 people on this Ark , and there are only enough dropships to carry 700 . My friends , this is an historic Unity Day . Every year , we mark the moment our ancestors of the 12 stations joined to form The Ark , but this is the last time we do so while aboard her . Next year ... on the ground . Right . After we did all the work . - Someone shut him up . - You shut up , Miller . No one 's forcing you to watch . For 97 years , we have eked out an existence , hoping that someday our descendants would return to earth ... Don 't tell me you don 't like Unity Day . Unity Day is a lie . The Ark only came together after the 13th Station was blown out of the sky . Just not the version of history we like to tell each other at parties . The Unity Day story gives people hope , though , and peace came out of that violence . Yeah , but did there need to be violence at all ? Whoo ! Yeah ! Monty strikes again ! Hey ! Call this batch Unity Juice ! Who 's thirsty ? Hey , save me some ! Happy Unity Day . Pass it around . To our sons and daughters on earth listening to this message , we will see you soon . The first Exodus ship will launch in under 60 hours , carrying the reinforcements that you need . So stay strong . Help is on the way . - Hello , Abby . - Diana . We have seen the true soul of our people . I hope there are no hard feelings about me taking the council seat . No hard feelings about anything at all today . That 's right . You 'll be able to see your daughter soon . But enough from me . You are all here for the pageant anyway , right ? - He 's cutting his remarks short . - What 's that ? Oh , nothing . I helped him with his speech . He 's leaving the best part out . Without further ado , I present the story of us . They tell me you 'll be on the first Exodus ship . Yes . I 'm overseeing security on the ground . Would you take the tree down for me ? Mom , I have a job to do . Well , at least come to the departure ceremony . You could give the traveler 's blessing . Think of it as a good-bye gift for your mother . I don 't remember it . Excuse me . Long ago when the earth was on fire , twelve stations floated through space all alone . Then one day , Mir floated by Shenzhen , and they realized life would be better together . The other stations saw this , and they wanted to be together , too . When all the stations were joined , they called themselves ... Daddy ? I 'll go and find and your daddy . Jaha , are you okay ? - Get him to medical now ! - Kane ! Find out who did this ! Mom . We need triage supplies now ! Dr. Griffin , we need your help over here . In peace , may you leave the shore . In love , may you find the next . Safe passage on your travels until our final journey to the ground may we meet again . Marcus ... I 'm so sorry . We need to get you out of here . Sir . This was a coup . Councilors Cole , Kaplan , Muir , and Fuji are dead . If you hadn 't cut your speech short ... Where 's Councilor Sydney ? She left before the blast . I 'll find her . You do that ... and double the guard at the dropship . I 'm putting the Ark on lockdown ! We are not ... missing that launch window . They suspect it was you . The way I see it , we got two choices : Stay and fight , in which case maybe we win if we can get enough workers to join us . And if we don 't , what 's the second choice ? - Take the Exodus ship now . - It 's not ready . Can our engineers get it ready ? To charge the batteries on a ship that size without causing a disruption to the Ark takes time . - Then cause disruptions . - It 'll get cold . With the lockdown , even if they find a way to isolate the lesser populated stations , people will die . So there 's casualties either way . Take the Exodus ship . We should have built a bigger bomb . Hey . The comms are still dead . They cut out during the pageant . Best Unity Day ever . Do you really think now is a good time to be having a party ? I mean , the Grounder is out there ... The Grounders . By now , he 's made it home . He 's probably putting together a lynch mob . Relax . I got security covered . Why don 't you go get a drink ? You look like you could use one . I could use more than one . Then have more than one . Clarke , the Exodus ship carrying your mother comes down here in two days . After that , the party 's over . Have some fun while you still can . You deserve it . Yeah . Okay . So do you , by the way . I 'll have my fun when the Grounders come . All right . Unity Day . Making bullets on Unity Day . The Grounders don 't know it 's Unity Day . How did Bellamy get you to help ? I volunteered . We have to be ready to fight , right ? Or we could try talking to them . They seem to prefer stabbing . Violence is the only thing those people understand . You know , they could say the same thing about us . If we keep going on this way , we 'll never stop digging graves . You didn 't see him , Finn . It didn 't matter what we did to him . He was ready to let you die . He was protecting himself . Why are you defending him ? Never mind . Hope you know what you 're doing . I know what I 'm doing . Better ? We 'll make a warrior out of you yet . Finn ? ! Lincoln , wait , wait ! He 's my friend . I think you lost this . So what the hell are you doing here ? I could ask you the same thing . I could also ask how long you 've known he speaks English . But I won 't . You blew this when your people were hunting us . You saved our lives . I have to believe there 's more like you . - I stabbed you . - And we tortured you . If the two of us can get along , then maybe there 's hope . Learn from history instead of repeating it , right ? How 's that gonna happen ? For starters , no more killing . I don 't have the power to call a truce . Then bring me to someone who does . Hey , look . The rest of our people are coming down here . - The first ship lands in two days . - It 's true . And because of the attacks , they 're sending mostly soldiers , the people that enforce our laws . The Ark is about survival at any cost , and they 'll kill people who fall out of line . When those people get down here , if they feel threatened , they will start a war , and I don 't want that . Neither do you , and I think that 's why you blew that horn . Once the soldiers get here , it 'll be too late , and we 'll have no power to stop them . But if they see that we 're at peace then maybe we have a chance to stay that way . All right . You bring your leader , I 'll bring mine . What , Bellamy ? He 'll never go for this . No . Not your brother . Clarke . Check . Bay 17 's clear . All right . It 's clear back here . Sir , the dropship 's clear . We did a full security sweep . Okay , boys and girls . Play time 's over . Back to work . Let 's get this ship ready to launch . I should be in medical , not packing first aid supplies . The injured are being taken care of . And we can do nothing for the dead . Marcus . I 'm sorry . Vera was an amazing spirit . This launch should be delayed , at least until you 've questioned the terrorist that set that bomb . I put word out to my people and just heard back . His name is Cuyler Ridley . He 's a mechanic who lost his wife in the culling . Yeah . I recognize him . So what makes you think he did it ? He turned himself in . Where have you been , Diana ? Why did you leave the pageant early ? Thank God I did , or I 'd be dead right now . I guess we 're both lucky . Stay where we can find you . Where am I gonna go , Kane ? Be careful . Ridley 's dangerous . You 're not gonna get this one . - Yes , I am . - No . It 's not happening . What do you know ? Her Highness can actually party . - I like it . - So what are you gonna do when the guard come down and commandeer Monty 's still ? Build another . All right . You ready ? No . Wait . I have done this before , I promise . What is it ? Let 's take a walk . Sorry . Did something happen ? I need you to come with me , but I can 't tell you why , okay ? Finn , tell me why . Hey . Don 't . I set up a meeting with the Grounders . A meeting ? I don 't understand . With who ? How ? I was just with the Grounder that we had in the dropship . - His name is Lincoln . - Wait a second . - He spoke to you ? - It 's not important . If we want to live in peace ... Finn , we can 't live in peace with people who 've done nothing but kill us . Can you think of a better way to stop the bloodshed ? Yeah . With the guns that the guard bring down . You really want a war ? Because at this rate , that 's what 's coming . Look . I know it 's a long shot . But this is our world now , and I think we can do better than the first time around . I trust him . I don 't . But if we go ... we have to bring backup . No way . We 're not bringing guns . Those weren 't the terms , and if we 're gonna do this , we got to give it a fair shot . Okay . Okay . I 'll ... I 'll get my pack , and I 'll meet you at the gate . Okay . Hey . I need to talk to you . - Having fun yet , princess ? - I 'm serious . You always are , so talk . Finn 's set up a meeting with the Grounders . I 'm leaving to go talk to them . Because you figure that impaling people on spears is code for " let 's be friends " ? Have you lost your damn mind ? I think it might be worth a shot . I mean , we do have to live with these people . They 'll probably gut you , string you up as a warning . Well , that 's why I 'm here . I need you to follow us , be our backup . Does Finn know about this ? Finn doesn 't need to know . And , Bellamy ... bring guns . Hey , hey ! There you are . All right . Listen . We 're playing drunkball . I bet Monroe my team 's gonna win the Unity Day title . That 's for you . I know you zero-G mechs have crazy hand-eye skills , so ? Huh ? What do you think ? It 's got to be more fun than ... whatever you 're doing . I 'm checking the gunpowder in these rounds so that if the Grounders try to kill us all , maybe we can get a few shots off beforehand . Hm ... That 's intense . Sure you know what you 're doing ? Why does everyone keep asking me ... Damn ! You need a hand now that , you know , you almost blew one off ? - I got this . - Hey ... no one 's a better mechanic , all right , but this stuff requires a chemist . How 'd you do in chemistry class ? Mm ! Well , the fates are smiling upon you , my friend . I was great in chemistry . Hm ... Ooh ! Nope . It 's gassed off . Pretty sure the acidic smell means that the gunpowder 's degraded . Better start a dud pile . You know , when my parents get here , they can mix us up some new gunpowder . My dad 's gonna flip for this scrap metal . " My kingdom for a soda can . " That 's what he always used to say . How about you ? Got any family ? Nope . Just Finn . Well , we all got each other now , right ? - Jasper , you 're coming with me . - I am ? You handled yourself well in the cave with the Grounder . I mean , I hit him in the head . If you 're planning on shooting anything , you better think twice . - I haven 't checked those yet . - Give me some bullets that work . What do you need them for ? Your boyfriend 's being an idiot . - I 'm coming with you . - We should get Clarke . Clarke 's with Finn , isn 't she ? I 'd love it if you were right about this , but did you ever consider it might be a trap ? Yep , but since it 's Unity Day , I decided to have hope instead . Ah ! Oh . Hey . Let me have a look at that . Seriously , Finn , you 're putting a lot of faith in a guy who stuck a knife in you . And you 're sounding more and more like Bellamy . I 'm just trying to keep us alive . So am I. At least they 're good for something . Sorry about bringing up Clarke earlier . - That was awkward . - Shut up . Both of you shut up . Keep your eyes open . You were seen planting the bomb , Ridley . You killed six people . Should have been seven . Jaha 's lucky he cut his speech short . I know you 're upset about what happened at Section 17 . I lost my wife ! You 're damn right I 'm upset ! But this is about more than the culling . Workers all over the Ark are tired of getting screwed . It 's our kids you sent to die on earth , and who 's on the first dropship ? Not us . Over and over , Jaha and the rest of you on the council betray our trust . Today is your reckoning . Tell me ... Who helped you ? I know you didn 't act alone . You don 't know jack . You still think this is just about the chancellor . Ah ! There goes the power . That 's our cue . Leave him . He 's gonna die in here anyway . What 's happened ? I 'm not sure . But we 've lost power to multiple stations . Farm , Hydra , Mecha . Now , we can vent in breathable air , but the temperature in those sections is falling fast . People are gonna freeze to death . Lift the lockdown and evacuate those stations . - Where 's Kane ? - He 's interrogating the bomber . Sir ... Power 's out in prison station . Marcus ! It 's a mutiny . Diana Sydney ... She 's ... She 's diverting power . She 's taking the Exodus ship . - Whoa ! What the hell are you doing ? - This is our ship now . Chancellor on deck . - How many of our people are on board ? - Less than 50 percent , ma 'am . They 're all upstairs on the passenger deck . - Tell me about the cargo . - Nearly all here . Search all the decks . Throw anyone not loyal to us out of the service hatches and back into the Ark . Lieutenant , you may give the order . Seal the doors , begin the launch protocol . We 're T-minus five and counting . Let him go ! He 's made his choice . - He 'll warn Jaha . - That hardly matters now . This Exodus ship belongs to all of you . You 're the future of the human race , and today , I 'm going to lead you home . So that 's how you set this up . You helped him escape , didn 't you ? - I trust him , Clarke . - There 's a lot of that going around . Someone 's coming . What 's Octavia doing here ? - Oh ... - I guess we know how he got away . Wait . Look . Oh , my God . Horses ! We said no weapons ! I was told there wouldn 't be . It 's too late now . She goes alone . - I 'll be fine . - Clarke ... Hey . It 's time to do better . Your name is Clarke ? Yes . I 'm Anya . I think we got off to a rough start . But we want to find a way to live together in peace . I understand . You started a war that you don 't know how to end . What ? No . We didn 't start anything . - You attacked us for no reason . - No reason ? The missiles you launched burned a village to the ground . The flares ? No . That was a signal meant for our families . - We had no idea ... - You 're invaders . Your ship landed in our territory . We didn 't know anyone was here . We thought the ground was uninhabited . You knew we were here when you sent an armed raiding party to capture one of us and torture him . These are all acts of war . I see your point . That 's why we need to put an end to all of this . I told you , it happened very fast . I 'm not even sure if Dr. Griffin was inside at the time . I 'm sorry . Sir , the Exodus ship is fully charged , and they 've begun the launch protocol . It won 't launch when the door 's open , that 's correct ? - It is . - Then get the damn door open . We can 't . It 's already pressurized , and we can only open it from the inside . - Keep trying ! - How long until launch ? Two minutes . - Diana , open the door ! - Sitrep forthcoming , ma 'am . We should be ready for launch momentarily . Upper levels clear ? Okay . Complete the sweep - and secure the hatches . - Yes , sir ! Assume flight positions . Hey ! What are you doing ? Abby ? - Diana , don 't do this . - It 's already done . - Get her out of here . - Wait . We could use a doctor on the ground . Come with us . You owe Jaha no loyalty . He 's killed your husband and betrayed you . You 're just like us . Think of your daughter , Abby . You can see Clarke again , today . I 'm nothing like you . Whoa ! Whoa ! Abby ! I got my pry bar in ! Somebody get me a jack ! Lincoln said there are more of you coming down , warriors . The guard , yes . But also farmers , doctors , engineers . We can help each other , but not if we 're at war . Can you promise that these new arrivals won 't attack us , that they 'll respect the terms you and I agree on ? I promise I will do everything I can to convince them to honor the terms that we set . Why would I agree to an alliance that your people can break the moment they get here ? Grounder princess looks pissed . Our princess has that effect . If you fire the first shot , those people coming down won 't bother negotiating . Our technology ... They will wipe you out . They wouldn 't be the first to try . Oh , no . No . This is bad . What the hell are you talking about ? There 's Grounders in the trees . - What ? - Where ? - Are you sure ? - I don 't see anything . They 're gonna shoot ! Clarke , run ! Run ! Clarke , get down ! Finn , get back ! Go , go ! Oh my God , Lincoln ! You 've been hit . It 's just a scratch . Okay . Run . Don 't stop till you get behind your walls . - Go ! Take her ! - Lincoln , no ! Go ! I got the jack ! Where 's Abby ? Send her through ! I will if you let the doors close . - No , no , no . They haven 't decoupled ! - What does that mean ? It means the dropship 's still tied into all of our major systems . Power , water , air ... If it launches , the Ark will be crippled , and everyone left on board will die . - Can we do it from our side ? - Yes , but it takes hours , - and they 're not waiting ! - Diana , please ! You don 't want to be remembered like this . I won 't be . Because you brought this on yourself , Jaha ! You promised the people truth , and all you gave them were lies ! You had me shot ! You detonated a bomb in a public meeting , killing six innocent people ! And now you want to kill everyone on this space station - to satisfy your ego ? - He is still lying to your face . There aren 't enough dropships to get everyone down to the ground . What is she talking about ? Trust me , we will figure this out . We will survive , we always do ! - Go ! Come on ! - You can 't trust him . More than 1,000 people , most of them workers like you , are gonna be left behind to die . You can still save yourself . I don 't trust either of you . We 've lost the main power generator . But I 'm going to the ground ! No ! Launch ! Sir , we have to go right now ! Everybody out ! Get back behind the containment doors . Go , go , go ! Please , sir . - You got something to say ? - Yeah . I told you no guns ! I told you we couldn 't trust the Grounders . I was right ! Why didn 't you tell me what you were up to ? I tried , but you were too busy making bullets for your gun . You 're lucky she brought that ! They came there to kill you , Finn . You don 't know that . Jasper fired the first shot ! You ruined everything . I saved you ! You 're welcome . Well , if we weren 't at war already , we sure as hell are now . You didn 't have to trust the Grounders . You just had to trust me . Like I said , best Unity Day ever . The Exodus ship ? Your mom 's early . Wait . Too fast . No parachute ? Something 's wrong .

 Whoa , whoa ! Hold on . - What floor ? - Sixteen . - Gonna be a nice one today . - Yeah , yeah . I think so . Man , you don 't look so good . Are you okay ? Hey , Lynda . I think something 's wrong with that guy . Sir ? You have to sign in . MAN 1 : Lynda , call 911 . MAN 2 : Is he all right ? One , two , three , four , five . - One , two , three , four , five . - Blood trickling down his nose . He 's ... He 's dead . MAN : What ? What is he ... ? WOMAN : He 's not breathing . [ ALL SCREAMING ] - May I help you ? - Yes . Uh , I 'm looking for someone who seems to have gotten lost . Okay . What school is he from ? He 's not from any school . He 's a man . His name is Dr. Walter Bishop . I see . A special-needs individual . Heh . You have no idea . When the Victoria , the last surviving ship returned to its harbor of departure after the first circumnavigation of the Earth only 18 of the original 237 men were onboard . - What happened to them ? - They all died , young lady . Horrible , and most likely painful deaths . You see , when you open new doors , there is a price to pay . Now , imagine tonight , you look under your bed and Io and behold , you find a monster and you 're immediately eaten . Now , if you hadn 't looked for the monster you wouldn 't have found it , and you 'd still be happy in your beds instead of being slowly digested in the stomach sac of the creature . But with any luck your sisters or your brothers might have heard your screams and your endeavor will serve as a valuable lesson for them . Excuse me . Do you work here ? No . I 'm a season-pass holder , but thank you . Dr. Walter Bishop . They had no right to revoke my membership . No right . Walter , you terrified those kids . [ PHONE RINGING ] - These children should know the truth . - Hello , Agent Dunham . They are being tragically coddled and ill-advised . Have you already told Peter ? Okay . We 'll be there right away . Come on . Detective , uh , I 'm Agent Dunham . This is Peter Bishop . Detective Kassel . We 've been taking witness statements trying to figure out what went down . - The ME here yet ? - On his way . It 's a Dutch license . " Radjan Vandenkemp . " - I 've never seen anything like this . - Lucky you . I 'm gonna talk to some of the witnesses . - Started walking . - I 'm Agent Dunham with the FBI . Hi . - Hi . - I 'll let you two talk . - Thank you . Uh , did he have an appointment here at Vitas ? Mm-mm . No one knew him . No one was expecting him . I don 't even think he knew where he was going himself . He got off the elevator , seemed confused and then collapsed . Okay , thanks . Broyles , he 's downstairs . He 's gonna run Vandenkemp , see what he can come up with . He didn 't know anybody . Doesn 't seem like the kind of business you walk into . Excuse me , uh , can I ask a question ? - Sure , Mr ? - Ames . Vincent Ames . I 'm the VP of Geotechnical Engineering . Will we be able to leave soon ? PETER : Okay . Let us know . - Not yet , I 'm afraid . AMES : Do we know what happened to him ? - That 's what we 're trying to figure out . We 'll let you know as soon as you can leave . Mike , the courier , rode up with him . Which one 's Mike ? He 's sitting right over there . Dr. Bishop , Agent Farnsworth . We 've got a deceased male , age 50 . We believe he 's from the Netherlands . Walked into Vitas Petrol at 7 : 30 this morning and his veins ruptured . Oh ! Oh , I see . Oh , uh , vasculitis could be a cause . Or , uh , an arteriovenous fistula which is an abnormal channel between the vessels . Extremely high blood pressure results , resulting in swelling of the veins . ASTRID : Until they rupture ? WALTER : Not usually . But then that 's why we 're here , I imagine . Don 't . No , don 't . [ GROANING ] This building must be quarantined immediately . No one goes in or out . I believe we have a contagion on our hands . But Olivia and Peter they 'll be trapped inside . Quarantine the building , Agent Broyles . I need to find out more about the first victim , Peter . The Dutchman . If I can find out where he came from , where he was then I can begin to ascertain what could have infected him . - Walter , we don 't know yet . - Well , who was he coming to see ? Someone up there must know him , know something ... [ INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE ] Walter ? The CDC is here . - You be careful up there , son . - I will . The CDC is here . Walter , it 's gonna be okay . We should get to work . AMES : Why are the police holding us ? We 're in the midst of a virus contamination . The Centers for Disease Control are here . - Are you saying we 're quarantined ? - For now . Yes . What happened to Mike ? He was infected . Is he dead ? He was the closest . He was right over the guy . You were there too , next to the courier . And Devon and Vincent . - You got his blood on you . - Why aren 't they sick ? - How do you explain that ? - I don 't know . It 's just a matter of time . [ QUIET RATTLING FROM ABOVE ] They shut down the air flow . I asked Detective Kassel to take care of it . It 's protocol . In case the virus is airborne , we don 't want it to spread . So I 'm gonna need to separate you into groups . Those who were near Vandenkemp if you could gather in one of the boardrooms . It 's just as a precaution until we know what this is and how it 's being spread . Come on , let 's go . MAN : Agent Broyles . Arnold McFadden , field director , CDC . I understand you 've got two people up there . Do we know whether this is the result of bio-terrorism ? We 're looking into that possibility , but nothing yet . AGENT : You wanted me ? - Let 's get a team into the lobby . Get blood work underway . Cut a two-block radius with barriers . [ HELICOPTER APPROACHING ] I 'll need at least half a dozen of those samples , young man . - Excuse me , who are you ? - And take me to your centrifuge . Agent Broyles . Uh , Walter has been arrested . Agent Broyles , thank God . Please tell these men to release me . He breached the security line . Claims he 's FBI but has no credentials . I said I was a consultant . Dr. Bishop works with us . His son , Peter , is inside the building . I need to get back to the lab . I 'm trying to determine what pathogen I 'm dealing with . - I need a blood sample to work with . - I understand your wanting to assist but I have experience with pathogens ... And I was chairman of biochemistry at Harvard and have little patience for small-minded bureaucrats . BROYLES : Walter . That 's not helping . I 'm sorry . We need more information . My son tells me that several people got blood on them from the infected man , but only one of them died . Why him ? Why aren 't the others showing symptoms ? I must get back to my lab and find out . BROYLES : No matter what your impressions are of Dr. Bishop I assure you he 's a valuable asset . Hubert , you will escort Dr. Bishop to his lab with a sample that you will not let out of your sight . Thank you . Thank you . Well , quickly get your pajamas off . Come on , let 's go . Come on , come on , come on . I can 't find the name Vandenkemp anywhere in this database . Well , he must 've been here to see somebody . - How far back did you go ? OLIVIA : Two months . They 're all calling their families . You wanna call your sister , just let her know what 's going on ? What do you make of this ? This guy , Ames , had two appointments this morning he cleared his calendar last minute yesterday , but he 's here . That doesn 't necessarily mean anything . That doesn 't necessarily not mean anything either . Guys . We have a problem . What 's happening to me ? Come on in here . I want you to lay down and just try and rest and relax as best you can , okay ? - Okay , I 'm gonna get you some water . - Thank you . Thank you . PETER : I 'll be right back . So how much time do you think she has ? I don 't know . The courier died maybe a half hour after giving Vandenkemp CPR . - She 's sick . - I 'm afraid so . - She didn 't get any blood on her . - You don 't know that . She was nowhere near him when he died . We could all have it . But we don 't know that . She was friends with the courier . Maybe he infected her . The fact is , we just don 't know . It 's important that we all stay calm . Can I talk to you in private , Mr. Ames ? Okay , I know Mr. Vandenkemp was here to see you . Your schedule was rearranged yesterday and your morning was cleared out . Why was he here ? He came here to sell me information from one of our competitors . - What kind of information ? - He said it was from a reserve find . Possible Vandenkemp came in contact with the virus there . Do you know which oil reserve ? Which competitor was it ? He wouldn 't say . All he said was , " I have something to show you . " Something I would find very valuable . He was supposed to be gone before the staff came in this morning . Well , where is it ? The information . I don 't know . He didn 't have anything with him . It 's a very competitive business . I know what I did breaks federal laws . - I 'd rather go to prison than die here . - It may be too late to trade one for the other now , Mr. Ames . Radjan Vandenkemp was an oil consultant . He arrived three days ago on a flight from Dubai . We 've already contacted 1 7 4 of the 212 passengers onboard . - No one 's shown signs of infection . - Were you able to track his movements ? He was staying at a Continental Inn . No symptoms reported there either . Also no indication of information he was selling . Have you heard from Walter ? Has he identified the virus ? - Not yet . I 'll let you know when I do . - Okay . WALTER : If we can isolate the strain we may be able to understand this virus ' personality . ASTRID : Personality ? - Walter , it 's not a person . - Centrifuge is over there . No , viruses are not people , Astrid . But they seem to have minds of their own . The rabies virus can 't survive in water so it inflicts its host with a paralyzing fear of water . - Walter , that sounds ... - Ha , ha . Trust me , I know how it sounds . It 's almost beyond belief . The more we learn about viruses , the more unbelievable they become . They deny our definitions of living and dead . Their only function seems to be to survive , to replicate and to use us as a vehicle to do so . It 's the folly of humans to believe we 're at the top of the food chain . In truth , viruses are . The strain won 't isolate . The sample was too fragile . Damn it . I was afraid of that . This is one piece of good news . I believe the virus is not airborne . No ? WALTER : If it were , there would be many more people showing signs of infection in that building . We need a better sample . - Broyles have anything ? - No . Whatever Vandenkemp was trying to sell , they can 't find it . - Were you able to get ahold of Rachel ? - No . I didn 't try . She went through all the stuff with me in the hospital and she 's still having nightmares about me being dead . What 's the point in scaring her again ? We are gonna get out of this . That is just like you . Even now , you 're protecting her . I thought that was the point of having people who care about you in your life . To have someone to talk to when you 're scared . She 's out . The receptionist . [ SCREAMING ] Peter . [ PHONE RINGING ] - Dunham . - What the hell is happening up there ? Peter , be careful . Mm-hm . Peter ? Peter . No . We can 't wait any longer . - Get away from him now . - I got his blood on me . - Lf I wasn 't infected , I probably am now . - This is insane . They 're down there , we 're up here , and they 're not sending anybody else up . This is our last chance to figure out what it was that he came here to try and sell . Rental-car keys . Never take anything into a negotiation that can land you in jail . Always leave it in neutral territory . The CDC is opening the briefcase now . You said his car was found in a garage nearby , yes ? - Underground ? - That 's right . I believe I have a hypothesis as to how this virus behaves . Go on . The receptionist had a very different reaction to the virus and I believe I know why . This virus wants to spread itself but in order to do so , it needs other organisms to infect . Vandenkemp arrived alone at the building and it wasn 't until he was in an office full of people that he sprayed . But having successfully infected other people I believe that the virus now senses that it 's contained within the building and it wants to get outside to continue spreading . - The virus wants to get outside . - Yes . Yes . Doesn 't that strike even you as a bit farfetched ? No . The courier only spewed as he approached the glass doors . From what you said , the receptionist showed an irrational desire to get outside , and then she sprayed . The virus compelled her to leave the building . It wanted to get outside . - You 're saying the virus made her jump ? - Yes . Yes , I believe so . McFADDEN : Among other things in the briefcase we found a drill-core sample from an exploratory oil dig . This is our virus . McFADDEN : This sample was stolen from Solum Oil Corp. By normal procedure , it would 've been stored in an airtight protective case . Which suggests Vandenkemp may have removed it in order to smuggle it out . Do those documents indicate how far down it came from ? McFADDEN : It came from 10 miles down . Well , in that case I believe we 're in the presence of a 75,000-year-old terror one that might have been responsible for wiping out the Ice Age mammals . - Some things are meant to be left alone . - Dr. Bishop , can you find a cure for it ? Maybe , in time . But right now we need to keep the safe people safe . Now that I have an isolated sample , I can produce a tox screen . At least we can identify who 's been infected . ROBOT : Would diamond or emeralds do ? WOMAN [ ON TV ] : Well , if they 're large enough . - Agent Dunham . Bill Hubert , CDC . - Hi . So , uh , how do you wanna do this ? Two groups , we divide alphabetically . Okay , I can do that . A through M 's , if you come with me , and the rest go with Agent Hubert . Call the State Department and get approval for a Level 6 eradication . Level 6 ? We don 't know how to contain it . If anybody on the outside got infected ... - Thank you . - No problem . Guys . MAN : Thanks . How are we doing in here ? We 're just getting started . ASTRID : First up , Vincent Ames . How will I know ? If you 're infected , the solution will turn black . Swab . Please swab the inside of your cheek . Amber . You 're clear . We 'll be in touch . All right , next is Peter and then Olivia . Ladies first . Swab your cheek . WALTER : You 're not infected . Peter . [ CLEARS THROAT ] You 're okay . You 're okay . Okay . Okay , next . Okay . Let 's get this first group downstairs . You guys , come with me . Let 's go . AGENT : This is the first batch of uninfected from both testing groups . Fiona Norris . Lauren Nossel . Glenn Paulson . Vincent Ames . Olivia Dunham . - Peter Bishop . - Wait , stop . - He 's bleeding . He 's infected . PETER : I just have to get outside . - Stop him . Get him away from the door . - I just have to get outside . I just have to get outside ! I 'm infected ? I 'm afraid so . But I wasn 't near anyone . Steve . You need to come with me . Olivia , please . Please , you gotta open this door . - Peter , I can 't . You know that . - Look at me . Just look at me . I 'm fine . - Just look at me . - Peter . Olivia . Olivia ! Amber . You 're clear . [ PHONE BUZZES ] Olivia . We just finished the tox screens . Peter is infected . Peter ? OLIVIA : The test was wrong . I don 't know how , but ... But he 's bleeding from his nose and he 's still in the building . Okay . What was that about Peter ? The Cambodian outbreak of ' 04 ? Killed 7300 people which could have been avoided if the Chinese authorities had moved quicker . That was Level 4 . This is classified as 6 . Right now , it 's the only option . Uh , they 've finished the tox screens . I heard . Eleven civilians infected and your colleague . I 'm sorry . So , what do we do now ? Extract the rest of the ones that tested negative . The State Department has authorized us to have the Army contain the rest . - The Army ? - Dunham . It 's the only way to make sure the virus is eradicated . There 's a dozen people . You cannot tell me that killing them is our only option . Come with me . Run it for her . This model is based on just one of those people getting out and infecting someone on the outside . This is two weeks from now . We have no symptom blocker . No cure . What solution do you propose , Agent Dunham ? Walter . Walter . You can 't take that off ... It doesn 't matter . The virus isn 't airborne . It 's transmitted by bodily fluids , blood , saliva . Walter , we are going to figure this out . Peter 's gonna be fine . It 's time to go . We 're taking all non-infected personnel out of the building now . ASTRID : Walter , we 'll have to help Peter from outside . Come on , Walter . Let 's go . [ PHONE RINGS ] Astrid , where are you ? Walter won 't leave . He thinks he can come up with a cure . Does he have any idea how to do that ? No , not yet . Astrid , they 're giving up . The CDC doesn 't wanna risk contamination so they 're planning on killing everyone inside . You can 't be in there . Walter will figure something out . - We 're gonna be fine . - Astrid ... - What did Agent Dunham want ? - Nothing . Help me drag this Dutchman into the kitchen . There 's a table in there and a sink . Homo sapiens persevered 100 millennia ago so something must have killed this virus . Slower metabolism , evolving blood types . Unless this wretched virus isn 't organism-specific . If I had an animal , a cat or a mouse ... No . No , no , no . No , there 's no time for that , of course . Walter ? What can I do ? I can 't let Peter die again . And he 's going to . They all will . And there 's nothing I can do about it . Walter , do you remember this morning ? What you said at the science museum ? You said that Magellan set sail around the world with a crew of 237 people . Two hundred thirty-seven , nearly all of whom died . Yeah , but 18 of them didn 't . That 's what you said , Walter . Despite the odds , 18 of them came back to their families . The rest died of scurvy , a slow , horrific death . Uncontrollable diarrhea . Pustulous bleeding . They all died . Except we 're still here . Seventy-five thousand years ago , the virus here wiped the planet clean but then life resumed . So something must have killed it . The active virus . - Ash . - Astrid . No , ash . Mount Toba the biggest volcanic eruption for the last 25 million years . It blocked out the sun . Sulfuric ash rained down all around the world . Sulfur . Sulfur . That could be it . - Where do we get sulfur ? - Open the fridge . Now , tell me what we got to work with . Um ... There 's diet soda . There 's relish . There 's , uh ... There 's yogurt . There 's string cheese , horseradish ... Oh , horseradish ! Horse ... Grab that . The glycoside in horseradish is high in sulfur . If I 'm right , this should attack the virus . Sulfide diluted to four parts per million . Then apply heat to catalyze the base . One point five cc 's should be enough . Okay . I got it . McFADDEN : After we 've notified the families of the deceased we 'll release a statement : The virus has been controlled . We don 't have any fear of a further outbreak . - Walter found a cure . - I 'll call you back . This is what he needs . A sulfide base , neuraminidase blocker . We 'd need a chemical supply lab . - The closest one 's in Wellesley . - Okay . - Several hours to synthesize an antidote . MAN : Let me out ! I 'm sorry , we just don 't have that long . That glass isn 't gonna hold much longer . - What if we buy you time ? - What are you thinking ? Fentanyl gas . Pump it inside the building knock them out long enough to synthesize a cure . We could have a truck here in 10 minutes . No , it wouldn 't disperse . The ventilation system is down . I can 't risk any more of my people to turn it on . Then I 'll do it . That 's up to Agent Broyles , not me . You 've got 15 minutes . - After that , I can 't take the chance . - Yes , sir . [ PEOPLE SCREAMING ] BROYLES [ OVER RADIO ] : Dunham , the gas truck is here . What 's your 20 ? I 'm in the elevator proceeding to the parking garage . MAN : You can 't keep us in here ! Aah ! AGENT : Keep those valves open . [ GRUNTS ] Listen , I 'm here to help you . Give me the gun , Olivia . - Peter , they 're gonna shoot you . - They 're going to kill us anyway . The cure is out there . They 're lying to us . And you locked me in here . You betrayed me ! [ BOTH GRUNTING ] Stay down . Dunham . Agent Dunham , can you hear me ? - Agent Farnsworth . ASTRID [ OVER PHONE ] : Sir . Is the ventilation system on ? No , sir , it 's still off . Olivia hasn 't made it yet . We have to move . I gave you 15 minutes . I understand you have operational authority here . There are people in there that are family to me . - Another 10 minutes . - I 'm sorry . AGENT : The fans are on . You 're a go . - Here , put this on . - Why ? Trust me . You 're gonna be okay , Peter . Just rest , son . Son . Thank you . All of you . You feeling better ? Oliv ... Ahem . I 'm sorry . You weren 't yourself . It 's lucky for me that you were . Walter . Um ... Inside , upstairs when you said , " I can 't let Peter die again " what did you mean by that ? Some things are meant to be left alone , Agent Farnsworth .

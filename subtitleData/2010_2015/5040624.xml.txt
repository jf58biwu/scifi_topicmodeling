Oh , Samuel , uh I totally fainted . well . See you soon . [ ? ] [ Airy piano melody ? ] Geoff Burton Samuel Mead , please . Injecting room here has a stereo microscope Quarantine room for incoming animals Room microscope with confocal imaging station . All the usual . Spinning disk confocal Two photons confocals Confocals vertical immersion lenses ... All laser lines that can be desired Anything to make science beautiful . We have a cold room . We have a living microbial culture ... The car glazer , ground floor . [ Geoffrey speaks softly , unintelligible ] How is your holiday , Geoffrey ? Oh , well , well . I wondered where my office going to be . Oh , do not really office , per se . We are more common than that . Of course , we can lend a laboratory for the duration of a particular project . Right . [ Electric Buzz ] [ Opens the door ] [ Beep continues ] Look what I found ... - Dr. Burton . - Dr. Fiedler . Rebekka has come a long way since he was hospitalized with you . Yes , I heard . [ Fast beep ] I 'm sorry , I can not stop this right now . We 'll catch up later . Grande . - Are we going to continue ? - Yes [ Heavy metal sound ] Like that . Now , there is something else we need to do . [ Accident ] Sorry , I do not ... [ Growl ] Ehh ... Anyway Let 's get his security clearance solved . [ Voice on TV , in German ] [ Clang ] Son of a bitch . [ German Television continues ] [ Sarah ] , Geoff ... How are you ? 'm fine . You ? Hmm ... I 'm fine . I , uh Set the new research laboratory . Uh , that of Munich , right ? Uh , no . Dresden , remember ? You should be happy . What 's that supposed to mean ? ... It 's nothing . - Forget about it [ Ben ] - . Hi , honey . I 'm home . [ Sarah ] Wait a second . So ... What is it ? [ Inhale ] I heard the news . When going to tell me ? was going to say . really was ... am in my second month and I. .. ... I was not sure , and I did not tell anyone . Well , Joe and Carla knew . . No , that was ... That was Ben . Right ... Ben . He was excited about the baby what jus-just told them , you know ? 're angry . [ Sniff ] No . .. course ... I 'm not angry . [ Tear ] I 'm I do not know , I have to think about it . Think what ? Well , what can I say ? Congratulations ? [ Mourn a little ] , I know maybe you could be happy for me . [ Minor chord dramatic ? ] What do you want ? Why did you call me ? I do not know why I called . [ Sniff ] I miss you . [ sob ] [ sniff ] I have to go . [ Repeat tone ] [ Music tense atmosphere ? ] [ Beep ] [ Environmental Dissonance ? ] [ Beeping continues ] Geoffrey Burton comes from the University of Massachusetts , where his research on early detection Embryonic abnormalities It has certainly proved to be one of the , uh , the most hotly debated furiously scientific community in this decade . Now , I need not tell you what are the implications of this are The proverbial cure for cancer always eluded us . Prenatal discovery potential certainly provides the opportunity for a few steps closer . And Geoffrey has been to continue his research in a much less politicized . And he will talk to all of us this morning On the status of their work to date . When ready . Thank you . Would you now everyone please join me to welcome Geoffrey Burton . [ Applause ] Thank you . Thanks , Samuel . I never intended to become a geneticist . My PhD was actually in bacterial biochemistry . But , as I 'm sure many of you know I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son Whose condition led me focus my research on screening embryos traces of rare genetic mutations . ... Like yours . I want to make one thing very clear : This is not eugenics . I 'm trying to develop new techniques prescreen people with brown eyes and dark skin Or freckles . I like freckles . Diversity ... One of the things defines us as a species be held . Mutations That endanger human life ... are not . For example ... Here we see the theme in the early stages The disease is not contagious in the traditional sense . However , while unusually virulent . I allowed the presumption to call Burton syndrome . What it did highlight this syndrome was his sudden appearance in what seemed to be a perfect health issue . Within days , the Symptoms had expressed as a number of neoplasias Exponentially multiplying and growing in size . These , uh Tumors like appendages eventually cover the entire body , as we can see . The breathing became increasingly difficult Began to affect the internal organs Crush the heart Constriction of the lungs . Brain activity ceased shortly thereafter . [ Cough ] From the first symptoms to death , the whole process took just over a week . What made this unique was that it was not an acquired condition as a virus , but apparently Random genetic mutation Occurring in the RIP-5 gene on chromosome 20 . [ Steps resonate ] [ Door creaks ] Very well . Let 's take a closer look at some samples of tissue . [ Metal Clang ] [ Unintelligible chatter ] I can sit here ? People do not want to know the way things happen . This fish , for example Nobody wants to think about it Suffocating In agony . We just want to fry Eat Forget . Same with science . People want the cure But research . It makes them feel uncomfortable , know how it got there , what you had to do . For what ... It is true . I like to live a million years Just to see what we evolved on . Do we become telepathic ? Do we have wings ? I like wings . And you What would you like ? I do not know , uh That I can be a time traveler . You know , travel through time , backwards and forwards ... Chiba I do not think that his patent has not already . Hello . I Jarek Novak . Geoffrey Burton . We actually met yesterday . Almost Freed mouse . - I did not know it was you . - Me . His lecture , I really like . Great images . Thank you ... I suppose . I was thinking Perhaps you would like to have a look some things I 've been working . It 's like , the same line , you know ? Yes ? Why not ? Good . We must have a drink . - Sure . - How about tonight ? Excuse me a moment . Excuse me . Sorry . [ Music dissonant ? ] [ Clicks light ] No , thank you . I leave . - You left ? - If . I think it has been a while since I last saw you . Yes , that was your choice . [ Dramatic piano chords ? ] Sorry . You know , I. .. ... I do not want to be uncomfortable . Not , either . You know , I 've been watching , though . You know , I 've been looking lift . Read all the papers . Very impressive . You are the one with Samuel approach me , right ? You know , I. .. [ Clears throat ] ... I felt like I had hit a wall with my research , and You know II found out what I was dealing with in the U.S. , so ... I thought maybe you 'd come . I , uh ... I do not know , I. .. To be honest , I expected you to say yes . What I have said " yes " to ? I can show you . Let 's go back . Good , because I have the cold ass . [ Laughs ] [ Water ] [ Click ] [ beep ] [ Beep ] [ clunk ] Have a seat . Okay So ... Now , here ... [ Click ] Okay , this is a typical regeneration cycle , about ten weeks after the complete regeneration amputation . Yes ? Yes . Well , now See it . Have you seen ? Uh ... lost . I 'm going to play again . Pay special attention . [ Tap tap ] It 's a joke , right ? That 's not possible . By inserting the gene for Easter I found accelerate the natural regeneration capacity salamanders road beyond That could have imagined . But since then , I have refined further genetic code . Just ... Wait a minute . What Easter gene ? What are you talking about ? Look . I labeled only transplanted Easter cells genes A GFP . They were localized to the area of ? the wound , but then took over completely . Look for yourself . [ Tone wavy ? ] That 's , uh ... Even I have succeeded in regenerating serious damage brain and spinal tissue . I mean , can you imagine the possibilities for this in humans ? Jesus Christ ... [ Laughs ] Exactly ... Easter . Why have not you posted this ? No . A discovery is not a cure . Even so , I mean ... It will not match the absorption in mice . What happens when you try ? Nothing . I 've been stuck for six months now . And then I thought , if someone could help me with the molecular mechanism Help me turn in mammals ... Hmm ... You know , I 'm sorry , I have an appointment with Samuel at this time , but what do you think about , you know , discussing this afternoon , during dinner ? - Yep . - In my house ? - What are you doing tonight ? - Nothing . Hm . I can cook something for you . - German ? - I like the German . Do not worry . Not a date . [ Jingle ] [ Dog barking ] [ Ding ] Hey ! Hey ... Looks like we 'll have a drink tonight , after all . Not together . [ Beeps and boops ] [ Beating ] Come on , I 'll give you a lift . I 'm not going back to the guest house , so ... It 's cold . Come on . Very well . [ Ballad of metal ? ] Want to try electric cigarette ? Uh , no . I have mine . ... Real cigarette . Ah ... Sorry , but It is a non-smoking car . Of course . Sorry . All right . Where are we going ? Oh , right ... Sorry , uh ... Eh .. [ Fights pronounce ] Fodenhau ... Foten ... I can see it ? Ah , Pfotenhauerstrasse Yes . I know that . Good . That 's where we go . I know , too ... - ... Very well . - Yes , you do ? - Yes , science . - Hmm . We are the same , the two . How do you know ? You know Taking risks , whatever it takes . A brave new world . A brave new world ... Yes , I have read that . I have ideas . You have saved me , uh , brilliant experiments . You can be part of them . Well , that 's a very kind offer , but A bit of my work a full time thing at this time Why are we stopping ? You know mosquitoes , bedbugs , fleas , ticks They are all vectors of the disease , right ? But instead of spreading the disease , Why not change the formula ? Do genetically modified virus carrying Antigens for their own plague . Imagine releasing this in the third world In Africa . Hm ? They 're going to be bitten , anyway . Why not let the trap Malaria vaccine instead ? But then , would first have to Inventing the malaria vaccine , right ? Do not you think it 's possible ? I did not say that . You know Stalin , Mao Tse-tung ... ? Only by reputation . Both believed they could transfer the ideology by breeding a generation indoctrinated to the next . And finally , you get to genetically programmed Communists . I mean , I know this sounds maybe a little ... crazy But There were some very good ideas there . [ Vocal inquisitive ] [ laughter ] [ Clears throat ] But , look , uh What good ideas we 're talking about , really ? - You 're not getting my point . - What is your point ? It is the idea And not making people believe in the idea . Uh huh . And that is the key to scientific freedom . ... And funding . Exactly . And it is necessary for freedom order to get good ideas . Mm-hmm . Because they can come from the most unexpected places . Like his son , for example . [ Starting on ] You know ... [ The engine starts ] ... I 'll walk from here . Rebekka welcomes me . [ Haunting piano notes ? ] [ Doorbell ] Why did not you call me ? I could have picked . I have a lift . Well , sort of ... Half a lift . ... Jarek such in high school . What about this guy ? I have not much to do with it . Oh . [ Jingle ] Do not you get enough of them at work ? I look beautiful . You know , are these foreign organisms and witty . Nothing like them on Earth . Mm-hmm . Do not agree ? I saw so always redundant . You know , the genetic dead ends . But again , after what I saw today Who knows ? What 's this ? [ Click ] They call wunderkammer . What ? Wunderkammer . [ Repeat quietly ] Wunderkammer ... They were used in the old days to show things that had not been classified yet . I 'm creating new wonders . So you 're an artist , now , and a scientist . Come on , let 's eat something . - All right , go ahead . - You are not in training , so ... - Tell me . - What ? Tell me . - What ? - What do you think ? Tell her what ? About this Easter gene yours . Why do you think I 'm here ? Mm-kay . I 'll tell you everything , with one condition . Okay . You must agree to work with me . Yes , okay . Sure . [ Tan ] for fruitful collaborations . - Okay , okay ... - Agreed . ... Because I need your brain . [ Jingle ] Only my brain . [ Sigh ] Okay , a little more ... You had a great impact on me , you know ? ... Have I ? You were unattainable Sort of Star Scientist Anything . Smart and Inspiring , and Intimidating , of course , also sometimes . - Hmm . - I mean , even now What you 're doing is Brave , I guess . Why is that ? - Forget about it . - No , no , no , no ... I think I 'm a little drunk . You tell me . [ Sigh ] Just Using your child that The conference I can not imagine what it must be . Sorry . - That 's fine . - I did not say that . Yes you did . Come on , Geoff . I 'm not criticizing . You know I have not posted nothing significant in four years ? Publish or perish , remember ? Is not what it used to mean ? They were forcing me out of UMass . But you knew that , right ? They were cutting my funds to my laboratory was impossible Waiting to resign . They could not shoot . That would be bad . You know , my son He was the only case . And killed him . I 'm just trying to find something positive out of it . You know if I do not , then What 's the point ? But you have made progress . I think you should go . - I 'm still a little tired , jet lag ... - Geoff ... The dinner was nice . I 'm going . Wait ... [ Clacks footsteps ] You look great , by the way . See you tomorrow .

Geoffrey Burton ... Jarek ... Novak . Yes . We , uh , met . Jarek and Rebekka made the initial discovery with the gene of Easter . I guess you have filled by now . Yes , she said . I 'm sure Jarek , here , you can bring up to speed . Yes . You 're staying in the guest house , right ? Mm-hmm . Just pop in when it suits you . What is your room number ? Oh , well , just ... I 'll call you . - You have my number ? - No . [ Slight vocalization ] I 'm sure someone can help . Ignore him , Geoffrey . He means well , just forget sometimes he is not the only horse on the track . Yes , but do you trust him ? I trust my staff . [ Beep ] Yes ? Si . Si . Mm-hmm . Danke . Danke schön . - Bad news ? - Hmm ? No . As usual administrative problems . Our donors are very generous , that allow a good margin of discretion But they are so impatient . And that 's where I come in ? You are an asset to our team , Geoffrey . I would not be here if it was . But I admit , I hope you 're excited Jarek it has to show Maybe even enough to give him the benefit of their experience . See , that 's where I 'm still confused . Sorry , but ... [ Babbling ] Are you asking me to collaborate with both Jarek and Rebekka ? Well , that depends on you . I can not tell you to stop your own research , after all , I mean ... That 's why we 're here . But you must admit , This is a unique and singular . Look , I had the impression that this was the draft Rebekka , Easter the gene was ... its discovery . Scientists know ... - ... Always arguing about who did what and when - If ... [ Giggle ] [ Sigh ] Actually , Geoffrey Between you and me .. ... This is a bit of a difficult situation . Rebekka has refused to cooperate with him further . Yes ? Why is that ? I do not know , but I can not cast him out of the project . So what are you working down there ? I have what some genotyping ago Retouching away , alone in the dark . It 's what suits you . In mice . The axolotl . He has a bit of ... The mice His favorite project ... Viral vectors , ... and so on . [ Long sigh ] Geoffrey Meet with him . I like to thaw , sometimes . Is there something wrong ? No , no ... I 'm Trying to get my bearings , is all . [ Beep ] Excuse me . I 'm finishing some embryos . [ Sigh ] [ giggle ] It 's so funny , I thought this morning we are like the yin and yang of mitosis . It works on the uncontrolled cellular proliferation , cancer Me , in perfect cell harmony . So what is the story of that kind Jarek ? What do you mean ? What about him ? No . It just seems a bit reserved . It 's a little weird . I do not know , Samuel thinks it 's some kind of genius . And you ? What do you mean ? You and always was , uh ... Are you kidding ? Just asking . [ Tease ] So what is really working ? I do not know what he is working . Will not tell me . To be honest , I really do not care . Something to do with the gene for Easter , maybe . Scheisse . Rebekka , Samuel said . - I told you ? - The Easter gene It was not just his discovery , right ? - This is my discovery . - But not yours alone . I 'm not a liar , Geoff . Look , I just want to know what you 're getting into , here . You say that we are working together , well But I do not even know who Research is more . II do not even know who is involved . Jarek is not involved in what I 'm doing . - You 've done the work with him . - Only a short In the early stages . I do not like his style . He was too reckless . Tried to master my project . He threatened to quit if Samuel did not take off . In the end , I won . Well , according to Samuel , who is still in it . Is cosmetics . You might want to see this . - Where did you get that ? - I recovered In the house mouse , and I suggest you change the locks . What do you mean ? Jarek has a clandestine laboratory setting , and I Yeah , I 'm pretty damn sure you 're testing the gene Easter in mice . What do you do ? - I 'll take care of it . - What ? - I 'll talk to Samuel . - Why ? Why not ... - ... Just face ... - It will not help . Is my research , right ? I want to try it my way . You have to trust me . Okay . [ Tone disturbing ? ] [ Click ] [ ? ] [ Arrangement tense ? ] [ Slight crunch ] [ Breaking ] [ Beep ] [ dissonant tones ? ] [ Sarah ] Do something , Geoff . Help him .

I want to have a little fun , human feel a change , please . Right ? Just tonight . One evening ? Promise ? [ Laughs ] Promise . Now , hold still . One more thing ... So , wait ... What ? You know , not Boston . I 'm not your intern anymore . You do not have to feel guilty . Why did you bring me here ? [ Exhale ] Hm ? [ Sigh ] move . Was it work or was it to start something new ? What if I said both ? So I would say not a very good idea . Not that I do not think you 're attractive , I do . It feels too ... Yes , okay . - There . - What ? - Rebekka ... - In this case , since the . I 'll warm up the car . [ Electronic Music ? ] [ Psychedelic Industrial techno music ? ] Hey .

Give me one good reason why not just go to Samuel and tell him what you 're doing . What am I doing ? Tell me . What do I do ? Well , I know you stole Rebekka research . I saw your stupid lapdog rest in the laboratory . There is no " research " and " my research . " We are just one big organism . Did someone tell you that ? No ? Well , see , that would be ... Do ... " Mouse " , " our mouse , " below . And our mouse tells me That has been testing the Easter gene in animals . I also know it 's working . I do not know , it 's How did you do . So , go ahead . Tell me how you did it . Guess I 'll have to wait and read my article . ... As everyone else . [ Vocal aggressive ] [ Grunting ] [ shock ] Stop ! [ Expression tense ] Enough !

I saw that grabs you , I saw you Talking to him last night , after work . That 's what I thought . So what ... ... What can I say ? What about you ? Well , I had a little adventure with Jarek . So what ? It was stupid . So stupid . At least I knew I was fucking . You called me last night Sarah . I was delirious . What 's your excuse ? Why do I need one ? Listen , I do not care if you were Sleeping with a whim What matters to me is that everything I 've been saying lately sounds like shit . - Lie ? - Lie . Okay , so let 's define a fuck for a moment , okay ? What is a lie is From that I would never leave it , despite everything you said . I never said anything that would make you ... Do you think it hurts ? I was scared . You know , it was more than a little in love with my teacher . I was afraid it could get out , and My career would suffer . That was long ago .

These are most pathogen free mice worldwide . Not if they belong to Jarek . We need a sample of that , too , in the negative . - I know how it works , Geoff . - Then do it ! What am I supposed to be looking ? Its gene Easter ! Jarek is using a viral vector to integrate in the mammalian genome . No embryos Fully grown mice . He took of mammals . Sorry , I did . I do not know how . What ? [ RIP ] I 'm proof . You know , you 're right . Screw the test . - Where are you going ? - Where is Jarek ? I do not know ... Yes , you do . Probably the house mouse .

 * 2047 A.D. * Have a Safe Flight * Six years since the FOS invasion began * 2053 A.D. * Japanese Military District Fuji Base According to IMDO , the International Mars Development Organization , the construction of the first colony , " Esperanza , " that began in 2030 , has come close to completion . When this colony is finished , it will be able to accept 500,000 immigrants from Earth . All the immigrants will be chosen after taking the IMDO 's strict exam . Hiroshi . What are you going to do ? What am I gonna to do ? No idea . In ten years , the Earth will be uninhabitable anyway . Only a handful of chosen ones can migrate to Mars . You 've already given up just because you failed the exam ? That 's so pathetic . Fooling around here won 't help you a single bit . Oniichan , you can 't go to Mars if you don 't study . Don 't get cocky just because you get good grades . Do you want to live on Mars , Koyomi ? Yep ! In the future , I want to live there with you and Oniichan . Yeah , yeah , study hard and erect a palatial residence there . I 'm counting on you . I can 't believe you . It looks pretty hopeless , so perhaps I 'll enlist in the army like you , Dad . They 'd let a bum like you in there ? Don 't be ridiculous . Don 't be ridiculous . Zip it . Akeshima speaking . Understood . I 'll be there in twenty minutes . It 's an emergency . I have to leave now . What ? You 're going to work ? But you promised to take me to a movie ! Sorry . I 'll take you next week . What 's up with her ? She 's pissed because she can 't go to the movie theater . Take care of her while I 'm out . Huh ? Where did I put it ? Where 's Dad ? He left already . I was going to give this to him ... You can give it to him when he comes back . To be honest , I thought things would work out eventually . I thought our peaceful days would continue forever , but that was just an illusion . That day , Dad didn 't come back . 2047 A.D. , September . Suddenly , an unknown asteroid named " Februus " entered Earth 's orbit . An intelligent life-form was living on it . This life-form , which the military named the " FOS , " began attacking mankind . The counteroffensive launched by various countries had no effect . The FOS deployed thermo-reactive weapons to melt the polar regions and caused sea levels to rise . This resulted in many metropolitan areas being submerged . Furthermore , the remaining cities were burnt to ashes , and in a mere six days , the majority of mankind was wiped out . In December of the same year , amidst all the chaos , the Temporary Government of Planetary Union , which extended across national borders to combat the FOS , was established . The military power of every nation was gathered under the PDFA , the Planet Defense Force Alliance . I 'm fighting ... Against a horde of black foes . What 's wrong , Akeshima ? Giving up already ? No , please wait a minute . I 'm not done yet . Senpai , you can 't turn the tide . As promised , you owe me two croquettes . Not again ... Twenty-four consecutive losses . Zip it , Sagawa . Oh yeah , I 've heard this rumor ... You wanna hear it ? Another false rumor ? You got tricked again ? Shut up and listen ! Rumor has it that a brand new secret weapon is hidden somewhere on this base . Codenamed Kairos . A wicked weapon so powerful that it wouldn 't fear even God . A nuclear weapon ? We already know that nuclear weapons don 't work against the FOS . Then what ... There 's no mistaking that it 's even more powerful than nukes . For example ... Yeah ? Looks like you 're having fun . C-Commander Yoshizawa ! When did you return ? About twenty minutes ago . You can stop twiddling your thumbs from boredom and rejoice . The East Russian Army 's anti-FOS operation " Tunguska " has failed . The East Russian Army base has been annihilated . Now all that 's left in the Far East is our Japanese Military District . Inspector General Yoshizawa from HQ just gave us , the GL Prototype Squadron , orders to execute the twelfth counterattack plan . You will be briefed tomorrow at 0900 . Everyone is on standby . Dismissed . Are we going to fight ? No way ... This is so sudden . Keep cool . Geez ... Ouch ... You 're prepared for this , right ? Akeshima-senpai ... About the FOS we 're going to fight ... What are they ? " Hostile , intelligent xenoform . " That 's how the military describes them . There are some people who say humans created them . Are you suspecting the military ? T-To be honest , I don 't know what I 'm supposed to believe . Don 't worry about all that . To me , the FOS are merely an enemy upon which I can exact my revenge . No matter what they are ... I 'll kill them . Actually , my brother was a soldier too . He was involved in the design of Geometric Limbs . So that 's why you volunteered as a pilot ? Yes . Despite being siblings , we didn 't spend much time together . I have no memories of him . I want to understand him better . That 's why I decided to pilot a GL . That 's it ? Yes . Um ... Do I have to need something like revenge to fight ? No ... I didn 't mean that . I 'm not sure whether I can fight or not . I 'm not driven by hate . I 'm sad that my brother died , but ... Are we on death watch or what ? ! How long were you sitting there , Captain Tazaki ? Drinking when you 're on standby ? You know drinking is prohibited . Chill out . Wanna drink ? I brew this synthetic sake at home . No way I 'm drinking that dodgy stuff ! Come on ... I put all my spirit into brewing it for a day like this . Either way , tomorrow we 're I will keep your moonshining a secret from the commander , so can you let me leave for two hours ? Where are you planning to go at this hour ? Hey ... It 's me . It 's been a while since we talked . There 's something important we need to discuss . Tonight at 2000 . I mean , can we meet at eight ? Just make up some excuse to leave your dorm . Got it ? This was a lively city before the FOS attacked . Now there 's not a single trace of life left . Such despicable scenery . There 's no guarantee of living for any survivors who don 't have any connections in the military . They either have to starve or live as plunderers . We 're blessed to have the military 's protection . Though there are some people who say we 're just cannon fodder . It 's been two years . Doing well ? Yes . How 's school going ? Okay ... I guess . What did you want to talk to me about ? The military is going to launch an attack tomorrow . So we don 't raise the enemy 's suspicions , there won 't be an evacuation notice . It 's possible that civilians could get dragged into the battle . Wait That 's why you have to go to Mars . To Mars ? You 'll board the Esperanza II shuttle at the temporary airport . Tomorrow at 9 AM , I 'll have Nakamura pick you up here . Prepare to leave the planet . Take your passport and credit card . And don 't forget the ID card the military gave you . What about you ? You 'll go alone . N-No ! I won 't go to Mars alone ! You must ! You have to get away from here . Family of military personnel have priority , so you can board it . Why won 't you come with me ? It 's dangerous , isn 't it ? I 'm a soldier ! A soldier ? That 's why Dad died . You 're going to die like him . I 'll avenge his death . That 's a lie . You joined the army because you wanted him to acknowledge you . It 's too late now ! That 's just stupid ! Just think about making it out alive . It 's none of your business what happened to him or me . We 'll cut off the Diffuser . What are you saying ? No one asked for your opinion . You all know that the PDFA is using the Diffuser , a plasma defense shield protecting Earth , to prevent any further invasions from the FOS . Duh ! But why are we going to disable it ? Three years ago , the 7th Research Laboratory under the supervision of the Inspector General managed to use terraforming technology for the military to complete the Diffuser in a rush . However ... It 's only a temporary solution . Do you know where the Diffuser pulls its massive energy needs from ? No ... Here . This place , the Fuji Base , is its energy supply . The world 's most powerful generator is within this base . I 've given my recommendation to use this gigantic energy source not to defend , but to attack the enemy Finally , we completed it last month . The means to destroying the enemy 's home base : the Convergence Energy Gun D-Cannon . Is that what you meant ? Probably . Today , the Civilian Intelligence Organization announced that the Japanese military has plans to launch an offensive . But neither the PDFA nor the Planet Government has made an official announcement . It is assumed this censoring was done to avoid any riots . There 's a little gap in this base 's security : after disabling the Diffuser and deploying the D-Cannon . Of course , the enemy will make use of this and directly attack this base . The D-Cannon needs 14 minutes and 40 seconds before it can fire . Your duty is to defend this base with your lives during that time . This is the final anti-FOS offensive we 're going to execute . Its codename is " Plan-Zet . " " Plan-Zet ... " According to the analysis of previous anti-FOS attacks , we have concluded that the enemy possesses a strong learning ability . In other words , they 're smart . This means any weapons and tactics we have already used against the FOS will have no effect on them . That 's why the enhanced anti-FOS mobile ambush weapons , Geometric Limbs , were developed . You are going to pilot them . So we 're just going to buy you time to fire the D-Cannon . Just us three ? Correct . The D-Cannon 's only able to fire one shot . This is going to be mankind 's final counterattack against the FOS . If we manage to destroy their base , the war will be over . However , if we should fail ... Mankind will be eradicated . Mankind ... eradicated ? We 've spent so much money in your training that we could have built a spaceship . Prove to us that your two years of training wasn 't for naught . All right ! All right ! All right ! All right ! All right ! All right ! Okay , stop . That woman pisses me off . Awesome ! She 's the daughter of Inspector General Yoshizawa and a Major in the United Army ... That 's what you 'd call a " military elite , " I guess . Do you want to be like her ? N-No way ! Ranks and titles mean nothing . I know how you feel , but it 's always the upper class who survives . Akeshima-senpai , your sister ... Koyomi , was it ? She entered the military middle school this year , right ? She 's got to be an elite , don 't you think ? Maybe she 'll turn out like our commander . Cut it out . The only way I could give her a normal childhood was to have her enter a military facility . I had no other choice . I 've lost my wife , daughter , and parents . You 'd better take care of your sister . That 's an order , got it ? Yes . That 's what I 'm going to do . Nakamura ? What 's wrong ? Well , your sister isn 't here . Where did she go ? Hey , what the hell ? ! Did you look for her ? ! That idiot ... What 's she thinking ? ! Commence energy transfer to the D-Cannon condenser . GL pilots , standby . We 've got visitors . All Geometric Limbs , sortie . All right ! Let 's give them a warm welcome ! Koyomi ... It 's planning to fire a long-range barrage directly at the base , huh ? Kaori , forget about the small fries . Aim for the mothership ! R-Roger ! I 'll go after the small fries . You two deal with the mothership . All right , go ! They 're not self-aware . Even the simulator was harder . Distance : 14,200 . Wind direction : 86d } . Wind velocity : 31 knots . Why aren 't you shooting ? ! The wind is too strong ! I can 't aim properly ! Just shoot ! It acted as a shield ! Keep shooting the crap out of it ! Roger ! Out of ammo . Captain , I don 't have any reserve magazines . Shit ! I 'm out of ammo too ! That was close . Crap ! The GLs are useless in close combat ! Not now ! Senpai , behind you ! Sa-Sagawa ! Brother ... I 'm sorry . Sagawa ! Kaori ! Damn you all ! Idiot ! Stop it ! They killed my father too ! Did you forget your order ? ! What are you doing ? ! I can 't let you die now ! Captain Tazaki ! Akeshima , make sure your sister grows up to be a fine lady . Captain ! Damn you ... Why ... We 've confirmed the destruction of all hostile units within a one hundred kilometer radius of the base . All units , return to base . Commander ... Second Lieutenant Sagawa and Captain Tazaki are ... I know . It 's a small price to pay for our objective . A small price ? ! My father was worshiped as a hero for ending the alien invasion twenty-eight years ago . He even climbed to the top of the military . Being the child of a man like him , I was always disparaged no matter where I went or what I accomplished . But if this operation succeeds , it will radically change my value . I 'll look down on those incompetent fools on Mars . Why ? ! Why ... How am I different from my father ? Is this my limit ? What is a kid doing here ? Where is my brother ... First Lieutenant Akeshima ? No idea . Koyomi ! Oniichan . Idiot ! Why are you here ? ! Why aren 't you at the airport ? ! Hey ! What the hell ? Pull the trigger , Akeshima . Plan-Zet has ended . No ... Everything has ended . If you aren 't going to shoot ... Why ? ! What will your death change ? Will that redeem you for sending your subordinates to their deaths ? Redeem me ? Are you kidding ? ! You will never understand how important this war is to me . By failing to defeat the FOS , I have no reason to live . That 's absurd ! What do you think a human life is worth ? ! Sagawa and Captain Tazaki died ! They died to protect this base you 're sitting in ! I wish I could say they died honorably ... But unfortunately , they died in vain . The enemy will take over the world . What 's that ? The countdown until the base self-destructs . Oh , and there 's no way to stop it . Why are you doing this ? This is my final task ! Koyomi ! The base will self-destruct in two minutes and fifty seconds . We don 't even have three minutes left . Can we manage to run away ? The base has an underground shelter . We have to go there . Nothing happened . What the ... What 's that ? I 'm Inspector General Yoshizawa Seiji . The fact that you 're seeing this projection means that the war 's outlook has become bleak . But you mustn 't give up yet . This isn 't a shelter . It 's the control room of our ultimate weapon : Kairos . Kairos ? We 're inside it ? Kairos is a double-edged sword . It 's a power that could destroy the enemy , but it can also destroy humanity . Therefore , I didn 't plan to use it as a weapon to attack but merely to defend the Earth . That 's the Diffuser . But it 's too late for wishful thinking now . I 'm ordering the deployment of Kairos . No , this is not an order . I want to entrust you with mankind 's final battle . The Kairos System is controlled by the operator 's thoughts . If you have a strong will , the enemy will perish . I pray that you will give mankind the chance to see tomorrow . Hey , wait ! Koyomi . Get out of the base through there . Wait , what about you ? Oniichan . I have to go . Why ? You were lucky to survive . Why are you putting your life in danger again ? Are you doing this to avenge Dad ? No . He won 't be coming back . But that doesn 't mean I 'm powerless . I don 't understand you . If I don 't do anything , Earth will perish . Our memories , dreams , and days will disappear . It will all become nothingness . Am I wrong ? You don 't have to do it . Someone ... Someone else can do it . Isn 't that so ? Koyomi . I am that person . There are times you can say " someone else can do it . " But there are times when no one else would do it . I 've been entrusted with this important mission by Dad and my comrades . Now I have to live up to their trust . Go . I 'll stay here ! I 'll stay with you ! Koyomi ! I don 't care if you hit me , but I won 't go ! Why ? Because I believe in you . After all ... you 're my brother . Koyomi ... What 's going on ? It 's an enemy attack ! Koyomi , let 's end this and go home . I 'll take you to the movies if we make it out in one piece . Don 't forget that promise . Kairos , launch . Target : enemy location , Asteroid Februus . Take off , Kairos ! Kairos Beam ! Deploy Diffuser ! We won 't get any closer to the asteroid like this . What should we do ? Maybe it will reveal its core after it 's dispatched all those units ? We can 't wait that long ! At this rate , it 'll destroy us ! The Diffuser is down ! All right , it 's approaching us ! I can 't shoot my beam . Oniichan , look below . This is bad ! It 's planning to smash Kairos and itself into Earth . If something as big as this were to smash into Earth ... The whole planet will be destroyed ! It 's hot ... Is it trying to burn us alive ? Koyomi ! Get it together , Koyomi ! Oniichan ... It 's from that day ... Koyomi ! Dad ... Help us ... Please ! Is this the end ? Is it over ? Was everything for naught ? Why ? Dad ... What should I do ? Dad ... Help us ! Stop being a sissy ! It 's your world ! You have to defend it ! When are you going to do it , if not now ? Keep fighting as long as you 're still alive ! Hiroshi ! Koyomi ... Hold on ... Thanks ... Koyomi ... Thank heavens . You finally came to . Have I been sleeping for three days ? No , about thirty minutes . Commander ... Why ? Do you need a reason ? It 's not for you two . Hot ! Remember what you said ? You 'd take me to a movie . Sure . There are no movies anymore . Silly , I knew that already . But one day , they will show them again . I 'm sure of it .

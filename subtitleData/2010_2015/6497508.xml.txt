One at a time ! - Do you guys know you 're driving with a gas hose ? - Yes , we are aware . Who is this ? - This is Albert from Sin City . Long-time follower . Hey Tara . - Hey Albert . How did you know we were driving that gas hose ? - One of those guys chasing you - I 'm watching his channel right now . - Good work , Albert . What 's his channel number ? - 473-999 - Got it ! Wyatt , look ! Wyatt , look out ! He 's coming right at us ! - Keep down , hold up the phone ! - They 're full fitting and extra absorbent . Don 't let wetness slow you down . - This kid 's got a sponsor ! - What ? ! - ♪ Absorbeez ♪ - Shit ! They 're gaining over us ! - Hang on ! - Come on , we 'll figure it out . - Sargent Maddox ! Phone call from you . From the states . - It 's late there . Is it an emergency ? - I 'm not sure , Sargent . - Thank you , Private . - Sargent Maddox , you 've got a call . Thank you , sir . - Carry out . - Hello , this is Sargent Maddox . - Look , Jonah , I 'm really sorry about Wyatt , man . - The rate he was going , it was just a matter of time , right ? - A matter of time for all of us . - Could you open that glove-box for me , will you ? Flip that switch right there . Watch this . - Nice . Where 'd you find this ? - I made that work . Super illegal today , I 'm telling you . but we 're in a hurry , so ... uh , fuck it ! - What ? What 's that goofy grin about ? - Nothing , man ... Now , I know y 'all didn 't get along , but when we were kids , man , your brother Wyatt . Back then , he was cool . - I don 't know ... all knew Wyatt was cool . A lot of good it did him . What did you hear about the night Wyatt died ? - What ? No one told you ? - They told me . " Your brother succumbed to blunt force injuries sustained by a hit and run accident . " And that he had drugs in his system . - He had drugs in his system , of course they told you that . Basically being for the cops didn 't do nothing . it was like he deserved to die . Case closed . - Feels weird to be home . You 've gotta be kidding me . - No , this can 't be right . The people ... they must be here for a different service . - No , there 's my sister . Thanks for the ride , Gabe . - I 'm gonna hoof it from here . - Ok , you sure ? - Yeah . - Hey ... Look at you . You look good . - No , no don 't be . - Hey dad . - Son . is it ... uh ... much to ask for you to be back in time for your father 's burial ? - I don 't know , dad . Was it too much to ask for you to wait for me to get back from halfway around the world ? - You 're here now . I already put some linens in the ... exercise room for you . - I can 't believe him . - He just doesn 't know who to be mad at . - So he 's moving me to an exercise room ? - I 'll show you . Hey ... uh ... Don 't worry about ... about missing the funeral . Wyatt wouldn 't have wanted you there . Seeing him wear a suit . Dude ... As a matter of fact he probably made you late . - Yeah he 's having a good laugh somewhere . You know ... they called me . Over there ? um-hum . Must have been Thursday ? - Sounds like he chose to speak to his brother last . Ok , Well , Um ... do you need anything ? - No , I 'm good. let me get settled and ... I 'll talk to you later , Ok ? Honestly , I just ... just really need to get out of this house . You know ? When ... when someone in your family dies ... There 's all this stuff that you have to deal with . And no one warns you about . Example : Who 's gonna cancel my brother 's cable ? Do we just let the bill go unpaid , or ... I mean , no one is exactly worried about his credit score anymore . - Hey Ash , do you mind if I check my email ? Ash ! - I used to know my family , but let me just say it 's not like anyone is going to take care of this stuff . My other brother ... he 's very responsible . But he 's also been gone since I was like thirteen . So ... I get to deal with the life of things like this . This came from the county coroner today . I think it has my brother 's stuff in it . The stuff he had on when he died . I 'm kind of terrified . And grossed out about opening it , but ... I 'd rather do it then let my dad do it . Yeah . Somehow you guys make me feel a little more brave . So , what do you guys think ? Should I open it ? - You need help with this stuff ? You just need to ask . And this ... is not for them . - You know what , Jay ? I 'm the one who handles all the stuff where you 're God knows where . So don 't get righteous with me . I mean , you 've been home what ? An hour ? - And Wyatt Maddox , the bionic bird brain has fallen for the fourth time . - Wyatt ! Wyatt ! Get the Goddamned bike out of the street ! Are those my sunglasses ? Come here ! - You OK , Wyatt ? Wyatt ? - Fine ! You 're such a geek . - No ... I 'm good , thanks . Hello ? - Who the hell is this on Wyld 's channel ? - Who the hell is this ? - Log off . Log of right now or I 'll hang up ! - Ok . It 's done . - Whoever you are , I hope you get a wicked case of pink eye . - Yeah . Thanks for that . Look , this is Jonah Maddox . I 'm Wyatt 's brother . - Right . Or maybe you 're the guy who murdered him . - Murdered ? Look , why don 't uh ... Why don 't you and I meet up and talk ? - Why don 't you get cancer ? - Cute . - This is happening right now . This is live TV . The number on the corner of the screen ... that 's gidgets rating . Oh ! Homegirl wiped out ! Well , she could have injured herself and then rescued by a handsome lifeguard . Now , imagine your advertisement at the bottom of the screen . Imagine an audience without the ability to fast-forward , skip , or delete that ad . Let 's see a demo . Are we beginning to grasp the potential here ? - Garrett , these numbers They 're fine ... but they don 't compare with the network 's post on a moderately popular draw . - Leonard , is it ? Don 't compare Eyecast with scripted . Wrong model . The small percentage of viewers who actually stay awake to watch that crap , they fast-forward your clients ' commercials and that negate to no one . You want to talk numbers ? - Of course , we want to talk numbers . - Ok , let 's talk about 9 / 11 . The Oklahoma city bombing . OJ trial , both gulf wars , well the first one , those got numbers . And that audience held . for days . No one TiVoed 911 . That 's the analogy you need to look at when talking about casting . No reruns . No DVR . No do overs . You 're only live once . Surprise . Immediacy . Chaos . That 's what the audience wants . What ? - You got to get this , Garrett . - Who is it ? - He just gave me his channel number . 79 . - Sorry . I 'm going to have to take this . We 're ... about done here , right ? - I 'm gonna watch some of these channels . See how I can package this . Well ... I 'm going to have you come to your all a moment ... I 'll be here ... just don 't wait too long . Wyld , in the flesh , good to meet you . Want some sushi ? - No , I 'm a Vegan . - Ha ! Bullshit . I 've seen your channel . I shouldn 't say this too loud .. but you 've got a ... few fans in this company . - Why should you be quiet about that ? - I mean , your channel 's not exactly what we put in our promotional materials . - No , I suppose it 's not . - Is that why you 're here , promotion ? - You 're a fan , right ? You watched what happened the other night ? - You 've been ... uh switched off for a little while , is that right ? I mean forgive me , I ... I don 't pay too close attention . - I 've been gone for a week . - Any trouble ? You got ... you and Tera got in a fight ? That Tara ... Life doesn 't offer too many costars like that . You were ... you were caught with another girl , right ? or is that me ? Wyld stop ... - No , that 's not what happened . Think about that . Now , you should be scripting this . That 's exactly what I 'm talking about , you know ? No half measures . Whatever your tag is , live it . - You don 't think what I 'm doing is enough ? Oh , I mean , you know ... Your numbers are descent . But Wyld ... You 're just a vessel . You got thousands of people seeing through your eyes . You got to get more . You want top-shelf sponsors ? Then you got to give them everything . - Everything ? - Everything . I gotta mosey . You want the tour ? - No , thank you . - You got a great count , even for a vegan 's . - Nice meeting you , Garrett . - A nightmare ? No , uh ... No , that ... that was memory . - This can be worse . - Ash ... Did we ... uh ... - No . - No ? - Uh uh . - What ... what were you waiting for ? - You were kind of passed out . - Alcohol plus opiate-based pain killers ... - Oh , no , no , see ... I slipped you a roofie . Just didn 't work out quite as I expected ... - Oh , maybe you should use a smaller dose . - Yeah , I 'll try that . - Seriously , though ... - I like you . - But ... - No , that is the reason , believe it or not . - So where 's the fire ? - Um ... Madison and me ... we ... we got that new sponsor , and now there 's all these ... obligations ... - I 'm off . Come on , stay right here . I 'll uh make an omelet . with the one egg that I have in the fridge . - He promised to sponsor . Go . - I 'm so over sponsors . - Why , are they pressuring you ? - Yeah , and they 're like , 'No , Conner , you take your time ... ' ' ... concentrate on feeling better ... ' and then they 're like ' Hey , guess who made nationals . ' - Oh , we don 't have to do anything we don 't want to , right ? - I guess not . Come on , we gotta do something . - Seriously ? - I knew you weren 't armed . You turn off Wyatt 's channel ? - It 's off , yeah . - You look ... uh ... different in person . - Most people do . - How 'd you get in here ? - Your brother 's house keys . - Shouldn 't have asked that . - You should have . - What are you looking for ? - Something that 's not here anymore . Let 's get out of here . I 'll buy you a waffle . - So , you and my brother were stealing cars ? - Racing cars . - Yeah , stolen cars . - Look , race your own car , it 's fifty viewers . Race a stolen car , it 's like 50 , 000 . - So how do you pick these cars ? - We got tipped . - There are cars all over this town just begging to be raced . I 'm talking about race cars . Barely street legal . Relegated to grocery getters . Rolled out for once a month for a clay wax . And all it takes is one pissed-off teenager one disgruntled valet , or a little help from the infamous mission creep . - So basically , we 're running a request line for felons . - Yes . - And what do they get in return ? These tipsters ? - They get to watch . it 's about taking risks . The faster the car , the closer the race , the higher the danger the better the ratings . On a good day everyone wins . Sponsor 's happy , viewer 's happy . - Wyatt and Tara are happy . - Oh , I don 't think your brother was going to make it as a day trader . And yeah . We had fun . - Fun ... What about the day my brother died ? Was that fun ? - What do you think ? Wyatt always likes to leave the car with a full tank . Like a rental . You know . Gas it up and leave the keys in a night drop . And that 's how the car doesn 't get boosted again . His little way of saying thank you , I think . That 's when the three horsemen showed up . - Get down ! get down ! - They 're gaining on us ! - That 's it ? No shouting , no threats , just bullets ? - Just bullets and buckshot . I mean , these guys wanted us to die in a hurry . - And you 'd never seen them before ? - Never . Once we got some distance , Wyatt dropped me off . - Hop out . Go inside . - What are you gonna do with this thing ? - I haven 't quite decided yet . What I might do I don 't want you anywhere near it , so please just get out and go inside . - Ok , text me when you are clear of this . Fuck . - Did my brother keep broadcasting ? And did you watch ? What did you see ? - Not much . Not enough . - He called me , you know ? That night . - What did he say ? - He said to say hi . What would happen if I relaunch Wyatt 's channel ? - Uh ... it would suck . - Tara . If these people think that Wyld is still alive , he might just come out of hiding . Hit men don 't like unfinished business . - Look , if your serious about this , then I 'm on board . - Thank you but no . This is between me and my - - Just stop right there . Wyatt was your brother , but he was my partner . There is no Wyld Life without me . - You know , Wyatt and I did have one thing in common . - What 's that ? - I can drive . - Oh , dude , dude , dude , look . We 're ready , we 're ready . Come on , come on . Hood up , hood up . Here we go . Here we go . See that countdown ? You got to get this , come on . There it is , there it is . Are ... you ready for this ? Yeah , baby ... Come on , come on . on three two ... Let it go . Let it simmer , guys . Man on fire ! Do it ! Yeah ! Yeah ! You took these with a red light camera ? - That 's right . - Well ... How did DMV know where to send the picture ? I mean , Dino here doesn 't seem to have a license plate . - They didn 't come from the DMV . - We hack the intersection cameras . That 's the only way to get the raw files . - Far out ! - I don 't know ... it seems risky . - That 's the work ! That risk , that 's a part of the art , man . I mean , without it , those would be worthless . - You got any sponsors ? - Hell , no . I 'm not a sellout . That 's the thing about street art . The second you 're bought , you 're sold . It 's done. over . - Is that Wyatt 's channel ? - Yeah . - Can I take a look at it ? - that 's why I brought it . - There 's a lot of stuff in here . - That records the last thing he looked at ? - No . These aren 't VCRs , grandpa . They 're transmitters . ready . For what ? - For what we call a rolling buffer . A contact camera constantly records them . And erase and record over and over again . - What 's the point if it doesn 't store anything ? - The software uses the buffer to add it out to your blinks . And drop signals . Otherwise , you know , these channels , they would be super annoying to watch . You know , constantly taking hits and dropping signals and whatnot . Usually it 's just a bunch of code but ... sometimes you can find some orphaned frames of video and ... A few seconds of a recent cast . You 're going to get a lot of ... - You see people ? This is live and we have a channel . - Hey , I didn 't know that Wyatt was ... - No , no , yeah . - Clearly . Accidental . - Yeah , that didn 't look like it was on purpose . - Gabe , could you ... - Alright . - Everybody stay calm . - Everybody make space . - Yes , got it . - Yes , let 's have everybody on the line while we 're trying to do this . - Your brother . Wyld 's channel used to be so edgy , dude . Very subversive . You guys should have never taken those sponsors . - Hey , we 're entitled to make a living . - Yeah , granted , but you can 't deny it changes things . Now he won 't even open up my channel to comment . I 'm gonna do my thing , people like it , great . if not , say they 'll fuck it . - That 's the car . - What is ? - Is that the airbag ? - Gabe ... - Oh , yeah , I 'm sorry . - No , hold on . Is that Wyatt 's phone ? - Yes . - That 's not his point of view on the screen . - He 's right , Gabe . - Hold on . Check it . Looks like he 's getting something out of the trunk . - What 's that ? - Let me see . It 's a QR code . And that can be linked to anything . Web address , price tag ... any information , really ... You 're in . - Really ? You 're gonna let that stop you ? - OK ... tell you what ... I 'm going to see if I can ninja my way into this website . And I will get in touch with y 'all if I find something . when I find something . - Thank you . - Yeah . - Wyatt 's death wasn 't an accident . - More jack . I mean , your brother , man ... God bless him , he was pushy . You said it yourself man . - I know what I said , man . They were fuckin ' chased . Shot at . - Rob a car ? Alright . Hey , jay , I 'm gonna find something . - I know . - Alright ? - Check 1 ... 2 1 ... 2 ... Check , check , 1,2 ... 1,2 ... - Cyrus , this is Slag ... He 's been fixing bets . He 's been scripting outcomes . - Badge found him camping out in public storage locker unit . Boards , the works . - You 'd like to untie him , wouldn 't you ? - Kind of . I like a stand up fight - I know you do . - Why don 't we get some blows ? You know , fight back ? - Yeah , that 's because you get all co-dependent with him . Not me . I just want to get him done with . I couldn 't stand watching him cycle through the stages of grief . Like denial ... " I didn 't do it , it wasn 't me . " " I 'm not the guy . " " but actually I am . " - And then the anger stage . if they got some fight in them it 's the time to do it . because then comes the bargaining - Makes my skin crawl . It 's like ... just ... - just shut up ! - It 's the pressure . Now that one I get . I really do . I just wish they 'd skip from anger to acceptance . there 's so much more grace . - Listen ... you can 't be like this one . I had this one time , this woman , right ? had one of those blades . - Yeah . You know one of the mini Katanas they use to cut sushi ? So I had this blade deep in this lady , right ? And you know what she does ? She hugs me . Hugs me . And then she takes her hand and she gets it through my hand . Crazy , right ? - Wish I could get emotional about that stuff . Jewish give lots of sentences for crimes of passion . There 's a guy down in Texas doing four months . Four shooting up his old lady . - Four months ! It 's like a fucking sabbatical . Pay ... your ... debts . - Have the Badge dump him somewhere . - Shut the fuck up ! - Do you always eat so healthy ? - Oh , I 'm sorry , Major Dick , I guess you prefer eating freeze dried ice cream out of a helmet . - MREs are better than you imagine . - they have to be . Look , I can 't be instructing you while we 're casting . That will be a dead giveaway that you 're not Wylde . So , a couple of pointers . Don 't blink too much and try not to hum to yourself . Think like you 're telling someone a story . Because you are , you just don 't know how it ends yet . And if things go south , just bail , and I 'll catch up with you later . Oh , and avoid mirrors . Ready ? Start casting . Good morning , followers . And normally Wylde and I don 't indulge in a lot of talking and naval gazing and such , but seeing that it 's been forever since our last cast I think we owe you an explanation . Now , if you 've been in the chat room then I 'm sure you 've seen the rumors about Wylde being hurt or us being killed . And while I do appreciate your concern , I have to ask : Whose channel do you think you 're watching ? Those lightweights who chased us ? Well , you won 't be seeing them for a while . Well , unless they recognize you . Yeah , so Wylde and I had to cool up for a bit , you know , regroup , hit the spa ... That , my friend , is today 's donor car . I 'm gonna go meet our mark . - So that one 's yours ? - See , that brown one . That 's my car . It 's very nice . Do you want to go for a ride ? - Ok . - Vehicle looks good . Where are my keys ? This one . - This isn 't your car . - This is my car . I don 't understand what the problem is . I really don 't have time to argue . - I thought I told you to bail if things wiped out . Let the keys is in the car . We 'll just figure out something else to do today . - No , no , no way . If the idea here is to get attention , this is the perfect opportunity . Now , if you want to get out , I understand . Get up . Wow , that was fast . - Oh , crap . OK , I hear nothing makes them madder than when people run , right ? I mean , when people run , cops make them go on the ground and stay on their face - No one 's gonna stand on your face . What ... what is this ? - Oh crap . I hate when this happens . They sending updates every ten freaking minutes . - Are we still on ? - No , not right now . - So no one 's seeing this ? - Hold on ! I have to read this to you , all right ? But you have to look at me . Try not to crash . - What is this ? - Just drive ! Please repeat after me . I understand and accept the terms of use . - What ? Just say it ! - I understand and accept the terms of use . - Alright . We 're back on . We 're casting . Oh crap ! - You in the Trans Am ! Pull over to the curb immediately ! Turn off the ignition ! - Huh ? I 'm sorry . You 're going to have to eat a fresh bowl of dicks , man ! - Did you just tell the cop to eat a fresh bowl of dicks ? - Pull over to the curb immediately ! - Here . Let 's pull between those trailers . This way . Ok . You good ? Hey folks . You know , I think we 'll go out for a bit , but we 'll see you soon . - I know it 's not that easy . - Hang on , buddy . Hang on for a sec . - Get off me . Get your hands down . Let me look at that cut . This guy 's casting . Man , hold on a second . Hold on . - You ... you ... You look like an ass backwards . - You 're not so good , huh ? You 're going through the denial stage right now . I just wanna talk to your buddy Wylde . Wylde . Last time I saw you , I put a bike chain across your face . I asked for more . It can be arrenged . It 's for your friend here . Hold this ... - Let 's go . - Oh , God . - The thing got pretty bad . - The good news is it 'll probably retain the ? That lens save his vision . - Thank God for that . OK ... Well .. What now ? - tomorrow we visit that place Gabe found . Make sure isn 't all for nothing . - Yeah , these designs are all by Jay Bahn , And I 'm like ... loving it . Yeah well ... maybe this one not as much ... uh ... Wow , I mean ... I kind of thought ... You know what , guys ? I 'm actually gonna get ready on my own . But when you get that push text tune in because tonight is gonna be different . Hey Ash ... Nice muffin top . Really sexy . Ashleigh , could you stand up straight , please ? You could be so much prettier if you 'd just stand up straight . And Ashleigh , stop mumbling , use your words . How could you be so fucking ugly and stupid and fat ? of course he doesn 't actually like you . Why would he ? Are you gonna channel this place ? - What 's the old saying ? Sunlight is the best disinfectant This place could use some sunlight . - Need a light ? Alright , take care . - I bet 200 they shoot someone . - Alright , moving right along . - 200 . - Details are as follows Chandler had unprotected sex with men four weeks ago Her recent menstrual cycle is late .

Alright , now winners , you may choose to extend betting to the next context Just keep in mind it is a long-term bet so please plan accordingly . Hans , could you step in for me ?

Alright , we walk out of here or I 'll paint you all with this guy 's DNA . Got it ? - Was that the dead man who stole my car ? Whose friend just hacked our site ? - I 'm not sure it 's the same guy , Cole . I mean , it looked like him but I don 't know . Let me give you an old suggestion , Tanner . It 's called a strategical moment . - I need commitment of the longest of sorts . It 's not something you do in HALF MEASURES ! - I can fix this . Alright ? I 'll grab the guys and we 'll go . - Go what ? Go what ? He 's got 80 , 000 bloody witnesses in his pants . Take care of it . Go on . Piss off . - Keep your head back . Does it hurt ? Put your head up . And keep it up . You 're quite handsome . Here we go . It 's not that bad . You 'll get blood in my hair . - Let them see . Look , a lot 's happened today and my head is just kind of spinning . - Yeah . I 'm gonna go . - Wait . Turn this thing off ... please . Open like this . Look at me . - Hey guys . Standing outside the entrance to Club Feux . Expecting for Victoria to arrive any second . Now , you know every time Victoria shows up it 's a story , but especially tonight because she is under house arrest so Her presence her or any place that serves alcohol , for that matter , is a violation of her parole . Uh , are you Max from that show ? Yeah . I 'm just waiting for Victoria to show up . - Yawn . - Stop it , Mandy . - Listen , I 'm gonna go out for a drink . - I think I know you two , you serve the fashion thing , right ? You girls are spicy ! - Yeah ! That 's us . We actually just got a sponsor . - What 's your work like ? - We were hoping you 'd say that . - Uh , Ashleigh , what you wearing ? - We are wearing our new - - Wait , folks , there she is . And who is she with ? What is she wearing ? Oh , no . That is awesome . That 's a bedazzled ankle monitor . Oh ! Meow ! - Hey . That ... was ... awesome . - Yeah , we were basically the opening act for Victoria . - Come on . - Wait , hold on a second . I just want my father to see how cute you are . - They 're not interested in me . - Oh , really ? Ok , you want me to turn on comments ? - No , actually , I really ... really don 't . - Text please . Can we not do this now ? Let 's see . Talia in Trevor City said " he is so hot . " - Ashleigh ... Sara in Boca Raton says " Don 't trust him , Ashleigh ! " And she even used an angry emoticon . What to do ? But you 're so popular with my general . - That 's great . What is your general like ? Eleven year-old girls ? they don 't buy snowboards . - Eleven to seventeen year old girls . And a smattering of thirty age women . Members of the LGBT community I present . Not to mention all the fine people that just want a glimpse of you . - Come on . - What are you doing ? - I 'm just ... checking to see how we did . - So , did you get the high score ? - What ? - Your ratings . How are they ? - Do you mean our ratings ? I 'm surprised anyone else was concerned , Those were biased ratings . - Congratulations . - That was the point , wasn 't it ? - Nice job . - I 'm gonna go . - Do you want me to give you a ride ? I can drop you somewhere . Why don 't you crash here and I 'll just ... I 'll go sleep in my dad 's ? - Wow . Sure is chivalrous of you . I don 't think I want to spend one more night in this bed or this apartment . You can have it . - I 'm real sorry I 'm not my brother , Tara . - Yeah , you 're right about that . - Why don 't you give me some pointers then ? From memory ? - Fuck ... you . You think I 'm a slut ? fine , assume whatever you want . I don 't have any pointers for you because me and your brother never happened . I guess Wyatt didn 't want me to become confused . - I think we should take a picture ! - Look , Ash . Vick 's got a fresh pedicure . Do you think she did that or do you think it was her cell mate ? - I don 't know that . - Hey guys , does this ankle monitor make my ankle look big ? Can I have the picture with Santa too ? Oh-oh . Look who 's coming to town . - Having fun ? - Yes . - You 're Ashleigh , right ? - Yeah . - You 're into casting , right ? - Yeah , a bit . Um ... This is Madison . We just got sponsored . - Nice ! What 's like a lot of followers to you ? - Oh , I don 't know , maybe like 20 , 000 ? - I get more than that when I get a pedicure . So how about tonight ? Any change ? - Um ... yeah ... we 've got already like ... 40K . But I figure it 's gonna be like that when we get a sponsor . - Somehow I don 't think that 's it . - Victoria ... drop it . - You 'd like that , wouldn 't you ? - Drop it ! - Are we .. wait ... was she in on it ? I mean , she can 't possibly be that naive , right ? - What are you guys talking about ? - Victoria ... seriously . - Ash , sweetie , a little advice . if you 're gonna fuck Conner while he 's casting , don 't get on top . Stay on missionary position . It 's a little more modest . - Ashleigh - Nice , Conner , real nice . And Victoria ? She 's a total bitch . Are you gonna unfriend me ? Are we unfriends ? - Ashleigh stop . Ashleigh seriously . Grow up . Think this is gonna help us both . - You are unbelievable ! - Let her go , Conner . Sorry Ash . - Ashleigh ! - Welcome back guys , Match here , your agent of casting , here I am reporting inside Club Fig in the ladies ' restroom where Ashleigh has just taken refuge inside a stall . It seems Conner was live when he and Ashleigh were fornicating Apparently he was Ashleigh 's ... maiden voyage . But ... the question remains Was Ashleigh 's cameo on Connor 's video unauthorized ? Was Ash simply trying to get her new beau 's pathetic numbers up ? Stay tuned . Hey ... Do me a favor . Send me a text letting me know you 're going out and I 'll make sure to get you some coverage . - You know , sometimes I think about why I channel myself , and ... It 's moments like this that I still have to understand .

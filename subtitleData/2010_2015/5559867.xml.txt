be an never completely with dinner span of control blue it did not sit well but orders are orders homeworks there was mister bean I was in promo was a war criminal and that 's where the retreat like like I was a captured spires come true I think the government knows in this is so soon as it gets I believe that there was a public no they would have been a number a very good reason to keep this secret firstly I think no government on earth could admit that are sophisticated and defenses are effectively relevant and that with facing your a technology that we simply have no defense against palestinian burrows comply with the order to keep the incident secret it was best for this to be doing let sleeping dogs lie yes we do I 'll I departed the base a normal to your rotation non-jew I 'm in community would be after the incident happened I did my best to stop thinking about it but that proves impossible I started not feeling well experience a number of different things are really need to the initial contact a star experience in business those home in problems and balancing problems three years afternoons knows statesman expertise in my hand hard friction it became a prisoner after I left brown waters ice storm heaven more problems name had been diagnosed with a heart murmur doctors are working could mean explanation what was going on we 've been praying for me on Police troopers stock the british government is in the process declassifying and releasing its entire r-calif of UFO files an official report states that colonel halt in his team returned to Rendlesham Forest days after the second sighting to investigate can hold recorded the levels of radiation and these were written off his official report into the incident sent to the Ministry of Defence levels can be replaced but call out with the team which included a disaster permits conceal sergeant levels and he had occurred are a new record the global solution out there are more Harling inside and in new areas the keep readings radiation turned off in three indentations that had been found in the forest floor Defense Intelligence star assessed that the radiation levels had been significantly higher than background by media connections bird business was ' cause by the revolution from that incident to those who one thing that the medical personal rescue won 't pose exposed to radiation know I have the leveller this isn 't doing bring up you know my muscles talk will be instanced solo bring a by radiation exposure or ordinary to read do I lied to doctors and to never have nice I your iPhone hours and exe no I have never had reviews explosion in the morning a new have when I came in the air force me into physical clearly shows like a man with a clean bill of health when I got out 1988 have active duty my exit physical shoals and I had several issues with my heart there 's no explanation other than the fact that right after these mister given the assessment radiation levels the landing site I believe that the government and the military close John and GM and explanation but with the military refusing to provide any answers it 's up to Pakistan and burrows to solve the Randalls a mystery on their own from prague came to an agreement that I would go under hypnosis if I had been kinda anything came up involving want to close to it if anything came out how do you feel call it was supposed to it we 've got it worked with Paul for I was possible to promote them you want to do for them following an encounter with a mysterious craft in Rendlesham Forest Jim Pakistan and John Burroughs suffer from increasingly poor health and the US military is unable were unwilling to explain why forced to search for answers on their own they turn to hypnosis I went out to california where the hypnosis was conducted the guy that was didn 't have no sense at that point in a very good job about this let me tell good have no social acid between two and three hours and went to a pretty good detail yes-man from beginning to end Roger Woodcock wilderness for in it is the oppression % uh Verizon but it 's both you like alright college football coach good we gotta go through it all the pope to week if you 're I during the hypnosis it comes out that I did have some kind interaction with something out there who got no one to one it 's very clear mammals I was being drawn tortured of booze you want but don 't want to put gold gold gold on I was passed in palm up in I believe I wuz inside whatever was twice I 'm Princeton Circle Dr Jin it gives a a decent explanation why I don 't know him trump Aniston walking around your Google ago further sessions explore what happened during perot 's sec inside when he met with colonel hart in the forest actual the hypnosis goes into a little bit more detail the second time the lights are back how are you ever coming back right we 're you helping over papa they were because for among her object wanted me out there like you know still to go with mmm this is minstrel for when don 't know my mind is some I believe the I 've been in her something I was inside war what is haha doors like 2004 why do you look like little specks a blue lights I have contact with something from somewhere else i 'm having a dialogue home well whole economy home now it 's getting bigger and bigger Mike will blamed I G Chris subsys I 'll is going uptown wider smaller and there 's a higher salt that wind I home him in the whole well in home home clearly I had some handlebar interaction with an intelligent home doctor March sneakers specializes in astrobiology and the search for intelligent life beyond a berth life originating someplace else in the solar system with the Galaxy and being either accidentally or purposefully brought the earth in the realm of possibilities intelligent life on another planet could be very different than a taj life on Earth the organisms may not have hands in our eyes they may not walk and talk like we do they may use their intelligence in different ways to be successful but that 's much harder for us to conceive of and much harder for us to look for it because we have no examples and never seen in europe or prior to this so I had no way to know whether as possible like John Burroughs chimp Aniston remains haunted by the events of December 1980 before them my perception your photos from Ichi feeling that kinda thing the never exist I mean we were safely only Mueller 's hold then it all changed coming all at once and I 'm well is only gay maybe two to three hours sleep in mine my so that swim there was just they get a psychiatrist and maybe help you with the sleep disorder it agreement losses the real a large Joe in time of I 'll from time I 'll be on in the woods his therapist is unable to penetrate beyond the moment Aniston touch the craft I 'll stuff things can 't remember from chiseled some to america you home well always skip over in goldberg mean interview alongside the warehouse approach could break that ahead again she 's that is the sign home and one who things tourism me recalling what happened never seen before alone read about all I remember was the first time a woman what girls like doing anti-missile statement role model I 'm really have no sense there was more in colours was being interviewed almost home you be involved having sold in Pearl phone given to me sessions torture this old and Jim Pattison I can see why they wouldn 't treat he member over security for sleep tried in this context could have to distinct purposes to get to the truth or to hype the truth the Americans and the British would be absolutely or for the squire complicated effective and defense network have been so totally compromised but wrong could just get like everyone would have a reason to keep quiet about this but repeated sessions with a therapist begin to break down the memory block the years after an encounter with a strange craft in Rendlesham Forest Jim Aniston undergoes hypnotherapy and discovers a memory block repeated hypnosis sessions revealed he was involved in a sec unsettling interrogation at a West Side I remember the going back down to one side you know like through and they look to the night in december twenty-fifth 1980 for answers the only thing that I home recall world 's 45 minutes home words were withdrawn to them mean base eclipse what 's happening so going late i sorry memory in the summer bits and pieces also knows bits and pieces became trunks entrance between the whole school their mission is contact with us there Time Traveler 's they r us they are out the future when I first heard myself on news films saying this I thought it was about one person talking focuses on this will leave because it 's beyond my thinking that kinda stuff were knew about hard time travel to that point was our movie came out in making sixty compound showing my age whirls that was it is time travel anything more than just fantasy doctor run now it has dedicated his career to study in the controversial theory of travel through time time normally flows in a linear way but past up to the present to the future however eyesight general theory of relativity says that time can be altered by gravity stronger happens the more time will slow down black holes can be thought about this sort of natural time machines because a blackboard causes an extreme the ending of space causes extreme on the speech close get to block forum gravity is getting stronger in time is slowing down so to get near the angela blackwell time comes nearly to a halt if i cant with time into a loop then I can go from mass to the present to the future by using light circulating like you can cause twisting the space and that just within the space complete with twisting time one can only go back in time to the moment that the device was created is the device that creates the affect I actually do nothing the time travel is possible but the I 'm certain I wonder if see only you know explanation through hypnosis Aniston covers one more buried memories the white was just a costly way be there was you know so I can see emails know I 've seen was ones and zeros I was like like crazy can see the fire during hypnosis is the first time I heard the words biannual in was done income tax on though when he asked what I was seeing are you respond by saying can see the bird Alexander for one is a professor of computer science binary is a mechanism for in Coalinga language in a sense a human language like English his Co rates were including ideas in to a into that language binary simply let you do it in a different way binary code is commonly used new in Co secret past around 1980 binary one well-known we 're in the process of putting our whole minor complication looking at you tennis I 'm not sure I see here the guy who wrote back in nineteen eighty would have been a to write boy noriko did he 's not a mathematician is not a crypto gripper doesn 't know binary code during losses I actually called fun from ministers buying records from controversies from the future and these people or us good in spite of credible witnesses and physical evidence the military remain silent on the strange object see in Rendlesham Forest in december of nineteen eighty no longer willing to keep quiet chimp Aniston and John Burroughs turn to hypnotherapy to uncover the details of the encounter which leads them to one last piece of the puzzle a mysterious pattern of ones and zeros no as binary code captain include I owns strong those the home simply I had a unit in the poem become go and then work with called the actual problem binary code is that unless you have a leave decoding the actual code itself 0 lines can be interpreted only a single person and it well that years no that person 's opinion three independent people day them perhaps it 's not their opinion perhaps there 's consensus and if the message is

's drawings on wall showing compound counter was something from outer space palestinian burrows now believe they experienced some kind of contact with Time Traveler 's from the future but the military still doesn 't acknowledge that anything unusual occurred in Rendlesham Forest I believe there are well aware that the incident had happened that night it was was an incident the involved newspaper var phenomena the official word from nice Acer forces a nothing happened are dollars or Woodbridge candidates in question I 'm I don 't rule out the possibility that this was extraterrestrial but na either can I say that I 've see nora aware of any definitive croup to far as I 'm concerned this incident is unexplained when I 've met Jim and John there 's a certain painted looked in there are

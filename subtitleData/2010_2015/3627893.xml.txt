 ¶ ¶ Whoa , whoa--hold on . What floor ? 16 . Gonna be a nice one today . yeah , yeah , I think so . Man , you don 't look so good . Are you okay ? Hey , linda , I think something 's wrong with that guy . Sir , you have to sign in . Linda , call 911 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . He 's ... He 's dead . ¶ the wheels on the bus go round and round ¶ ¶ round and round , round and round ... ¶ May I help you ? Yes , uh , I 'm looking for someone who seems To have gotten lost . Okay , what school is he from ? He 's not from any school . He 's a man . His name is dr . Walter bishop . Hmm , I see . A special needs individual . Heh , you have no idea . When the victoria , The last surviving ship , Returned to its harbor of departure After the first circumnavigation of the earth , Only 18 of the original 237 men were on board . What happened to them ? They all died , young lady . Horrible and most likely painful deaths . You see , when you open new doors , There is a price to pay . Now imagine ... Tonight , you look under your bed , And , lo and behold , You find a monster ! And you 're immediately eaten . Now , if you hadn 't Looked for the monster , You wouldn 't have found it , And you 'd still be happy in your beds , Instead of being slowly digested In the stomach sack of the creature . But , with any luck , Your sisters or your brothers Might have heard your screams , And your endeavor will serve As a valuable lesson for them . Excuse me , do you work here ? No , I 'm a- - a season pass holder . But thank you . Dr. Walter bishop . They had no right to revoke my membership . No right . Walter , you terrified those kids . These children should know the truth . Hello . Agent dunham ? They 're tragically coddled and ill-advised . Have you already told peter ? Okay ... We 'll be there right away . Come on . Detective , I 'm agent dunham . This is peter bishop . Detective kassel . We 've been taking witness statements , Trying to figure out what went down . Is the m.E. Here yet ? On his way . It 's a dutch license . Radjan vandenkemp . I 've never seen anything like this . Lucky you . I 'm gonna talk to some of the witnesses . I 'm agent dunham with the f.B.I. Hi . I 'll let you two talk . Thank you . Uh ... Did he have an appointment here at vitas ? Mm-mm . No one knew him . No one was expecting him . I don 't even think he knew where he was going himself . He got off the elevator , Seemed confused , and then collapsed . Okay , thanks . It 's broyles . He 's downstairs . He 's gonna run vandenkemp and see what he can come up with . Well , see , he didn 't know anybody here , And this doesn 't seem like the kind of business That you just walk into . Excuse me . Can I ask a question ? Sure , mr ... Uh , ames . Vincent ames . I 'm the vp of geotechnical engineering . Will we be able to leave soon ? Not yet , I 'm afraid . do we know what happened to him yet ? That 's what we 're trying to figure out . But we 'll let you know as soon as you can leave . Mike , the courier rode up with him . Which one 's mike ? He 's sitting right over here . Dr. Bishop , agent farnsworth . Got a deceased male , age 50 . We believe he 's from the netherlands . Walked into vitas petrol at 7 : 30 this morning , And his veins ruptured . Oh ! Oh , I see . Well , uh , vasculitis could be a cause . Or , uh , an arteriovenous fistula , Which is an abnormal channel between the vessels . Extremely high blood pressure results , Resulting in swelling of the veins . until they rupture ? no , no , not usually . But then , that 's why we 're here , I imagine . Don 't , no , don 't ! This building must be quarantined immediately . No one goes in or out . I believe we have a contagion on our hands . But olivia and peter- - They 'll be trapped inside . Quarantine the building , agent broyles . I need to find out more about the first victim , peter . The dutchman . If I can find out where he came from , Where he was , Then I could begin to ascertain What could have infected him . Walter , we don 't know yet . Well , who was he coming to see ? Someone up there must know him . Know something . Walter ? The cdc is here . You be careful up there , son . I will . The cdc is here . Walter , it 's gonna be okay . We should get to work . Why are the police holding us here ? We think we 're in the midst of a virus contamination . The centers for disease control are here . Are you saying we 're quarantined ? For now , yes . What happened to mike ? He was infected . Is he ... Dead ? He was closest to him . He was right over the guy . You were there too , carl . You were there next to the courier . And devon and vincent . You all got his blood on you . Then why aren 't they sick too ? How do you explain that ? I don 't know , elaine . But I 'm sure it 's just a matter of time . They shut down the airflow . I asked detective castle to take care of it . His protocol ... In case the virus is airborne . We don 't want it to spread through the building . So I 'm gonna need to separate you into groups . Those who were near vandenkemp , If you could gather in one of the boardrooms . It 's just a precaution until we know what this is And how it 's being spread . Come on , let 's go ! Agent broyles , arnold mcfadden , Field director , cdc . I understand you 've got two people up there . Do we know yet whether this is the result Of a bioterrorism event ? We 're looking into that possibility as we speak , But nothing yet . You wanted me ? Let 's get a team into the lobby . Get blood work on your way . Cut a two-block radius with barriers . I will need at least half a dozen of those samples , Young man . Excuse me , who are you ? Take me to your centrifuge . Excuse me . Agent broyles , uh , walter has been arrested . Agent broyles , thank god you 're here . Please tell these men to release me . He breached the security line . Claims he 's f.B.I. , But he 's got no credentials or identification . I said I was a consultant . Dr. Bishop works with us . His son peter 's inside the building . I need to get back to the lab . I 'm trying to determine what pathogen I 'm dealing with . And I need a blood sampl e - something to work with . I can understand your wanting to assist , doctor . But I have a great deal of experience with pathogens . And I was chairman of biochemistry at harvard And have little patience . For small-minded bureaucrats . Walter ... That 's not helping . I-I 'm sorry . We need more information . My son tells me that several people got blood on them From the infected man . But only one of them died . Why him ? Why aren 't the others showing symptoms ? I must get back to my lab and find out . No matter what your impressions are of dr . Bishop , I assure you he 's a valuable asset . Hubert , you will escort dr . Bishop to his lab With samples that you will not let out of your sight . Thank you . Thank you . Quickly , get your pajamas off and- - Come on , let 's go ! Come on . Come on . You know , I can 't find the name vandenkemp Anywhere in this database . But he must have been here to see somebody . How far back did you go ? Two months . They 're all calling their families . Wanna call your sister ? Just to let her know what 's going on ? What do you make of this ? This guy , ames , He had two appointments this morning , But he cleared his calendar Last minute yesterday . But he 's here . That doesn 't necessarily mean anything . And it doesn 't necessarily not mean anything , either . Guys ... We have a problem . what 's happening to me ? Come on in here . I want you to lay down And just try and rest and relax as best you can , okay ? Okay , I 'm gonna get you some water . Thank you . Thank you . Be right back . So how much time do you think she has ? I don 't know , the courier died ... Maybe half hour after giving vandenkemp cpr . She 's sick ? I 'm afraid so . But she didn 't get any of the blood on her . You don 't know that for sure . She didn 't ; she was nowhere near him when he died ! which means we could all have it . But we don 't know that . She was friends with the courier , right ? Maybe he touched her . He could have infected her . The fact is , we just don 't know . But it 's important that we all stay calm . Can I talk to you in private , mr . Ames ? Okay , I know mr . Vandenkemp was here to see you . Your schedule was rearranged yesterday And your morning was cleared out . Why was he here ? He came here to sell me some information From one of our competitors . What kind of information ? All he said was it was from a recent reserve find . Well , it 's possible that vandenkemp Came in contact with the virus there , So do you know which oil reserve ? Which competitor was it ? He wouldn 't say . All he said was , " I have something to show you . " Something I would find very valuable . He was supposed to be gone Before the staff came in this morning . Well , where is it , The information ? I don 't know . He didn 't have anything with him . It 's a very competitive business , agent dunham . I know what I did breaks a dozen federal laws , But I 'd rather go to prison than die here . Well , it may be too late to trade one for the other now , Mr. Ames . Radjan vandenkemp was an oil consultant . He arrived at logan three days ago on a flight from dubai . We 've already contacted 174 Of the 212 passengers on board . No one 's shown any signs of infection . Were you able to track his movements ? He was staying at a continental inn . We have agents at the hotel . No symptoms reported there either , But also no indication of any information he was selling . Have you heard from walter ? Has he been able to identify the virus ? No , not yet , but I 'll let you know when I do . Okay . if we can isolate the strain , We may be able to understand this virus 's personality . The personality ? Walter , it 's not a person . Centrifuge is over there . No , viruses are not people , astrid . But they seem to have minds of their own . The rabies virus Can 't survive in water . So it inflicts its host with a paralyzing fear of water . Walter , that sounds ... Heh , trust me , I know how it sounds . It 's almost beyond belief . The more we learn about viruses , The more unbelievable they become . They deny our definitions of living and dead . And their only function seems to be To survive , to replicate . And they use us as a vehicle to do so . It 's the folly of humans To believe we 're at the top of the food chain . In truth , viruses are . The strain won 't isolate . The sample was too fragile . Damn it . I was afraid of that . Well , this is one piece of good news . I believe the virus is not airborne . No ? No . If it were , There 'd be many more people Showing signs of infection in that building . We need a better sample . Broyles have anything ? No . Whatever vandenkemp was trying to sell , They can 't find it . You able to get a hold of rachel ? No . I didn 't try . She just went through all this stuff With me in the hospital , And she 's still having nightmares About me being dead . What 's the point in scaring her again ? We are gonna get out of this . That 's just like you . Even now , you 're protecting her . I thought that was the point Of having people who care about you In your life ... To have someone to talk to when you 're scared . She 's out . The receptionist . Aaaah ! Peter ... Dunham . What the hell 's happening up there ? Peter , be careful . Peter . Peter , no ! Can 't wait any longer . Stop it ! Get away from him now ! I got his blood on me . If I wasn 't infected before , I probably am now . Peter , this is insane ! They 're down there and we 're up here . And they 're not sending anybody else up . This is our last chance to figure out whatever it was That he came here to try and sell . Rental car keys . Never take anything into a negotiation That can land you in jail . Always leave it in neutral territory . The cdc is opening the briefcase now . You said his car was found In a garage nearby . It 's underground ? That 's right . I believe I have a hypothesis As to how this virus behaves . Go on . Well , the receptionist had a very different reaction To the virus than the other two victims . And I believe I know why . This virus ... Has to spread itself , but in order to do so , It needs other organisms to infect . Vandenkemp arrived alone at the building , And it wasn 't until he was in an office full of people That he sprayed . B-but ... Having successfully infected other people , I believe that the virus now senses That it 's contained within the building , And--and it wants to get outside to continue spreading . The virus wants to get outside ? Yes , yeah . Doesn 't that strike even you as a bit far-fetched ? No ... The courier only spewed As he approached the glass doors . And from what you 've said , the receptionist Showed an irrational desire to get outside , And then she sprayed . The virus compelled her to leave the building . It wanted to get outside . You 're saying the virus made her jump . Yes . Yes ! I believe so . Among other things in the briefcase , We found a drill core sample From an exploratory oil dig . This is our virus . The sample was stolen from solum oil corp . By normal procedure , it would have been stored In an airtight , protective case . Which suggests vandenkemp may have removed it In order to smuggle it out . Do those documents indicate how far down it came from ? It came from ten miles down . In that case , I believe we 're in the presence Of a 75,000-year-old terror . One that might have been responsible For wiping out the ice age mammals . Some things are meant to be left alone . Dr. Bishop , can you find a cure for it ? Maybe , in time . But right now , we need to keep the safe people safe . Now that I have an isolated sample , I can produce a tox screen . At least we can identify who 's been infected . Would diamonds or emeralds do ? Agent dunham , Bill hubert , cdc . Hi . So , uh , how do you want to do this ? Two groups . We divide alphabetically . Okay , I can do that . " a " through ms , if you come with me . And the rest can go with agent hubert . Call the state department . Get approval for a level six eradication . Level six ? We don 't know how to contain it . If anybody on the outside got infected ... Thank you . No problem . How we doing in here ? We 're just getting started . First up , vincent ames . Hohow will I know ? If you 're infected , The solution will turn black . Swab . Please swab the inside of your cheek . Amber . You 're clear . We 'll be in touch . All right , next is peter , And then olivia . Ladies first . Swab your cheek . You 're not infected . Peter . You 're okay . You 're okay . Okay . Okay . Next . Okay , let 's get this first group downstairs . You guys , come with me . Let 's go . This is the first batch of uninfected From both testing groups . Nona norris . Lauren nossel . Glen paulsen . Vincent ames . Olivia dunham . Peter bishop . Wait , stop ! He 's bleeding from the nose . He 's infected . I just have to get outside . Stop him ! Get him away from the door ! I just have to get outside ! Uhh ! I just have to get outside . I 'm infected ? I 'm afraid so . But I wasn 't near anyone . Steve , you need to come with me . Olivia , please ! Please , you 've got to open this door . Peter , I can 't . You know that . Look at me . Just look at me . I 'm fine . Just look at me . Peter ... Olivia ... Olivia ! Amber . You 're clear . Olivia , we just finished the tox screens . Peter is infected . Peter ? Yeah , the test was wrong . I-I don 't know how , but ... But he 's bleeding from his nose And he 's still in the building . Okay . What was that about peter ? The cambodian outbreak of ' 04 ... Killed 7,300 people , Most of which could have been avoided If the chinese authorities had moved quicker . That was level four . This is classified as six . Right now , it 's the only option . Uh , they finished the tox screens . I heard . 11 civilians infected , and your colleague . I 'm sorry . So what do we do now ? Extract the rest of the ones that tested negative , And the state department has authorized us To have the army move in and contain the rest . The army ? Dunham . It 's the only definitive way To make sure that the virus is eradicated . There are still a dozen people in that building . You cannot tell me that killing them Is our only option . Come with me . Run it for her . This model is based On just one of those people getting out And infecting someone on the outside . This is two weeks from now . We have no symptom blocker , no cure . What solution do you propose , agent dunham ? Walter ... Walter , you can 't take that off . It doesn 't matter . The virus isn 't airborne . It 's transmitted by bodily fluid s - - blood , saliva . Walter , we are going to figure this out . Peter 's gonna be fine . It 's time to go . We 're taking all non-infected personnel Out of the building--now . Walter , we 'll have to help peter From outside . Come on , walter , let 's go . Astrid , where are you ? Walter won 't leave . He thinks he can come up with a cure . Does he have any idea how to do that ? No , not yet . Astrid , they 're giving up . The--the cdc doesn 't want to risk contamination , So they 're planning on killing everyone inside . You can 't be in there . Walter will figure something out . We 're gonna be fine . Astrid ... What did agent dunham want ? Nothing . Help me drag this dutchman into the kitchen . There 's a table in there , and a sink . Homo sapiens persevered 100 millennia ago . So something must have killed this virus . Slower metabolisms , evolving blood types . Unless the wretched virus isn 't organism-specific . If I had an animal , a cat or a mouse ... No . No , no , no . No , there 's no time for that , of course . Walter ... What can I do ? I can 't let peter die again . He 's going to . They all will . There 's nothing I can do about it . Walter , do you remember this morning ? What you said at the science museum . You said that magellan set sail around the world With a crew of 237 people . 237 . Nearly all of whom died . Yeah , but 18 of them didn 't . That 's what you said , walter . Despite the odds , 18 of them came back to their families . The rest died of scurvy . A slow , horrific death . Uncontrollable diarrhea , pustulous bleeding . They all died . Except ... We 're still here . 75,000 years ago , Our virus here wiped the planet clean . Then life resumed . So something ... Must have killed The active virus . Ash . Astrid . No ... Ash . Mount toba ... The biggest volcanic eruption For the last 25 million years . It blocked out the sun . Sulfuric ash rained down All around the world . Sulfur . Sulfur ! That could be it . Where do we get sulfur ? Open the fridge . Now , tell me what we 've got to work with . Um ... There 's diet soda . There 's relish , there 's , uh ... There 's yogurt , there 's string cheese , There 's horseradish , there 's milk- - Ooh , horseradish ! Horseradish , good . Grab that . The glycoside in horseradish is high in sulfur . If I 'm right , this should attack the virus . Thank you . Sulfide diluted to four parts per million . Then apply heat to catalyze the base . 1.5 ccs should be enough . Okay . I got it . After we 've notified the families of the deceased , We 'll release a statement . The virus has been controlled . And we don 't have any fear of a further outbreak . Walter found a cure . I 'll call you back . This is what he needs . Sulfide base , neuraminidase blocker . We 'd need a chemical supply lab . The closest one 's in wellesley . Okay . And several hours to synthesize the antidote . I 'm sorry , agent dunham , we just don 't have that long . That glass isn 't gonna hold much longer . What if we could buy you some time ? What are you thinking ? Fentanyl gas . Pump it inside the building . Knock them out long enough to synthesize a cure . We could have a gas truck here in ten minutes . No , even if we could , it wouldn 't disperse . The building 's ventilation system is down , And I can 't risk sending any more of my people inside To turn it on . Then I 'll do it . That 's up to agent broyles , not me . You 've got 15 minutes . After that , I can 't take the chance . Yes , sir . let us out ! dunham , the gas truck is here . What 's your 20 ? I 'm in the elevator , Proceeding to the parking garage . Uhh ! Ohh ! Listen , I 'm here to help you . Give me the gun , olivia . Peter , they 're gonna shoot you . They 're gonna kill us all anyway . The cure is out there . They 're lying to us . And you locked me in here . Uhh ! Uhh ! Uhh ! You betrayed me ! Ahh ! Uhh ! Hyuh ! Agh ! Stay down . Dunham . Agent dunham , can you hear me ? Agent farnsworth . Sir . Is the ventilation system on yet ? No , sir . It 's still off . Olivia hasn 't made it yet . We have to move . I gave you 15 minutes . I understand you have operational authority here . But there are people in there that are like family to me . Another ten minutes . I 'm sorry . Here , put this on . Trust me . You 're going to be okay , peter . Just rest , son . Son . Thank you . All of you . You feeling better ? Olivia ... I 'm sorry . You weren 't yourself . It 's lucky for me that you were . Walter . Um ... Inside ... Upstairs ... When you said , " I can 't let peter die again ... " What did you mean by that ? Some things are meant to be left alone , Agent farnsworth .

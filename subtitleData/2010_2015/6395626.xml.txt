That doesn 't mean it 's okay . Hey , this is our last weekend together . Do you really want to spend it arguing about Sal ? - Don 't say that . - Don 't say what ? Last weekend . You make it sound like we 're never going to see each other again . Hey , Montreal 's a long way from here . This is a big deal for me . You don 't think it 's a big deal for me too ?

Are you serious ? I just wanted some better material for my reel . What , and this is better material ? Don 't worry ... I 'II edit you out .

What are those for ? - Motion sickness . - Oh , motion sickness , yeah . Try not to yak on me on this flight , okay , sweet cheeks ? Thanks for being so supportive . At least it 's only like an hour-and-a-half flight . The drive up there was brutal . Remember it ? But we might get a decent camping spot this year , which would be amazing . I don 't know . I heard there 's supposed to be twice as many people this year . How about you just relax ? There 's going to be plenty of room . - That 's what you said last year . - So ?

Tower : Yankee Zulu X-ray , squad 5247 and ident , cleared 5,500 . Yankee Zulu X-ray , squad 5247 , cleared 5,500 . Tower : Yankee Zulu X-ray , you 're radar identified . Greenlight altimeter is two niner eight niner . Yankee Zulu X-ray , roger . - What 's happening ? - I just told them who we are and what we want to do and they assigned us a new transponder code so that radar can identify us . It 's all routine . There 's nothing to worry about . So , Sara , what 's with you taking the train to McGill ? It was my dad 's idea . He thought I could see more of the country that way . You still need a ride at the ass crack of dawn ? No , it 's okay . I 've got it covered . Um , actually my dad really wanted to see me off , so I told him he could drive . Whatever . Just let me know . Yeah , but I thought that ... Never mind . Someone take this . Take it . Oh great . This thing always goes out of tune . - Mel : Tune it up . - What are you doing ? - Filming you . - I can see that . AII right . So you gonna shoot that video for my band or what ? That depends . Do I still get final cut ? You can have whatever you want as long as it got hos in it . Classy , I like it . Speaking of hos , how 's the love life ? Ooh , getting a little personal , don 't you think ? Come on , you can tell me . Anybody special ? - There might be . - It 's a dude . Oh yeah ? Anybody we know ? Um , I better not say . - Why not ? - She 's got a boyfriend . Funny guy . ( Strumming guitar ) Shouldn 't you keep your hands on the wheel ? It 's okay , that 's what the rudder pedals are for . ( Velcro rips ) - You forget something ? - No . I 'm just making sure my gift 's not getting crushed . You brought it ? Of course . - What gift ? - Just a little something . Oh yeah ? What 'd you get him , a personality or something ? - Show us ! - No , it 's just a comic book . Sara : The guy at the store said it was pretty rare and I figured since Bruce was a collector ... A comic book . - You 're one of those guys . - What is that supposed to mean ? Dude , nothing , buddy . Come on , let me see it . - Yeah , come on . - Cory : Come on , let me see it . He can 't right now because he 's flying the plane . - Whoa . What ? - Mel : Sara . Sara , can you please stop screwing around with this guy ? - Sara : Our lives are in his hands . - Just relax , okay ? She knows what she 's doing . Sara : You 're doing fine . See ? It 's not that hard . - ( Plane rattles ) - Whoa ! ( Panting ) Shit ! Shit ! I think we get the point now . Can you take back the controls , please ? No , it 's all right . It 's just a little bit of turbulence . - Just pull back slowly . - L can 't . - Just pull back slowly . - No , I can 't . ( Rattling ) - Sara , this isn 't funny anymore . - Come on , pull back . Cory : I think we 'd all be more comfortable with Sara flying the plane . - No offence , man . - Sara , come on now . Jesus , Sara . God . That was fun . Next time I want to be in front . Are you all right ? - Fuck this shit . Give me this . - Hey ! - Sara : Sal , come on . - What are you gonna do , punk , huh ? Oh , I 'm sorry . Is this yours ? " Ooh , ' Weird Stories . " - Ooh , creepy . - Hey , dude , do you mind ? - Guys , give it back . - You want it ? - Be careful with it . - Easy , guys . Be careful . Be careful , it 's a comic book . Mel : Sal , just give it back . My God , I 'm taking it out of its protective case thing . Oh . Oh my God . Great condition . Sal , you 're so not funny . Stop it . - It 's ripping . - Come on . Mel : Sal , what are you doing ? I 'm sorry . Oh my God , this looks pretty important to the story . - Seriously ? - Oh . What , are you seven years old reading comics ? You know , the next time you try and get us killed - I 'm wiping my whole ass with it . - Okay , Sal , that 's enough . Okay ? Just give it back to him . - Little kid still reading comics . - Give it back to him . Yeah , you want your comic ? You want your comic ? - Take your fucking comic . - Come on , Sal . God . It 's okay . What 's that ? It 's a bus ticket to Montreal . Montreal ? Isn 't that where you 're moving , Sara ? Sorry , man . I was gonna tell you . When exactly were you gonna tell me ? I don 't know . We 'II talk about this later . - Centre , Yankee Zulu X-ray . - Yankee Zulu X-ray . Yankee Zulu X-ray requesting 10,500 for weather . Yankee Zulu X-ray , you 're cleared to 10,500 , negative traffic . Hey . What 's going on ? Um , we 've got weather ahead and I 'm not instrument rated - so we 'II have to climb above it . - Whoa whoa whoa . What does not instrument rated mean ? It means I have to visually maintain separation from the ground at all times . Translation : it means she can 't fly through clouds . Clouds ? Are you kidding me ? ( Groans ) Will you shut up ? How high does this thing go anyway ? Surface ceiling is 24,000 . 24,000 ? Look at it this way ... Commercial airlines fly at 40 . ( Rattling ) Sorry about that , guys . It 's just a little bit of unsettled air . - Unsettled air ? - It 's the third time . 10,000 . Aren 't we supposed to level off or something ? - I 'm trying . - What do you mean you 're trying ? It means I 'm trying . - Quit screwing around , Sara . - This isn 't a joke . The elevator 's not responding for some reason . - There 's an elevator on this plane ? - Not that kind of elevator . You see that part on the tail that 's sticking up at an angle ? - Which part ? - The hinged sextion . - Yeah . - Okay , when air goes over it the tail goes down , making us go up . I don 't know , something 's jammed it . - You 've got to be kidding me . - Come on . - What do we do ? - Sal : Mel , put the camera away ! For 10 minutes ! Centre , Yankee Zulu X-ray . I think I have a problem here . Yankee Zulu X-ray , Centre . Are you declaring an emergency ? Yankee Zulu X-ray , uh ... not at this time . Not at this time ? I thought you said we couldn 't level off . No , there are procedures for this . I 'll just reduce power . You should probably tell them that then , Sara . Hey , who 's the pilot here ? Everyone just relax , okay ? ( Thunder rumbling ) Oh no . Oh shit . Coz , we should turn around . Turn this thing around . Sara , we need to go back . - Let 's turn around now . - Yeah . What the hell ? ( Thunder rumbling ) This is bad . I 'm sure this is bad . Sara : Everybody just stay calm , okay ? 20,000 ? That 's impossible . Cory : 20,000 feet ? Is that right ? It can 't be . There must be some kind of glitch . Centre , Yankee Zulu X-ray . My elevator is jammed and my instruments are malfunctioning . I am climbing and have lost position in cloud . Please advise . ( Static ) - Centre , Yankee Zulu X-ray . - Hey , what the hell is going on ? I can 't raise anybody . What do you mean you can 't raise anybody ? Mayday mayday mayday . Yankee Zulu X-ray . Approximately 15 miles east of Patterson VOR , altitude unknown , instrument failure . - Please respond . - ( static ) Mayday mayday mayday . Yankee Zulu X-ray . ( Radio screeching ) Sara ? No one 's answering . There 's nothing . - Just dead air . - Jesus Christ . - So what do we do ? - L don 't know . You don 't know ? You 're the pilot . Get us out of this ! Okay , what about the procedures ? You said you wanted to reduce power . I can 't risk it now . Visibility is zero . And without instruments we could fly straight into a mountain . Hey , what did you do ? Huh ? You let him fly the plane . He probably fucked something up . - He didn 't do anything . - Yeah well , somebody did . Sal : Yeah yeah yeah , he 's right . You know what ? This is your fault , Sara . Sara : This is not my fault . How long have you had your license anyway ? Sara : Long enough . You only checked out on one of these things , what , like a week ago ? Jesus Christ , I can 't believe I was stupid enough ... Sal , will you just calm down ? You 're not helping . Maybe I missed something during the preflight , I don 't know . - Cory : Maybe you missed something ? - Sal : Oh , there you go . Sara : We need to contact traffic control . If they still have a radar fix on us they can talk us down . Um , cell phones . Does anyone have a signal ? - ( Beeps ) - No . Wait wait wait . ( Beeps ) - Fuck , I got nothing . - Same here . Think . Shit , something 's wrong . We 're stalling . I have to go to maximum power . Bruce ? Bruce , God damn it ! There 's a pilot operating handbook underneath the seat . - Can you give it to me , please ? - You want to check the manual ? I thought you knew how to fly this thing . Just give it to me , please . Give it to me ! Go to section 5 . - Now what ? - The maximum take off weight . It should say somewhere . Uh , 6,500 . Okay , if we 're over that the stall speed will change . What 's the basic empty weight ? - 4891 . - Sal , how much do you weigh ? - What ? - How much ? - Uh , 170 , why ? - Mel ? - 110 . - 155 . Bruce ? Bruce , please . Um , 150 . Okay , I 'm 110 plus 100 for baggage . 1,000 for fuel . - 1800 . - 1800 ? I think we 're too heavy . We should get rid of anything we don 't need . - Are you kidding me ? - Do I look like I 'm kidding ? Sara , I 'm not throwing my stuff out of the plane . You know what ? I 'II do it for you , okay ? - Sal , no . No ! - Sit down . I 'm gonna open the hatch . - Be careful , please . - You know I will . - You guys ready ? - Yeah , I got it . - AII right , anchor me . - I got you , I got you . Got me ? AII right , I 'm opening . - Be careful back there . - All right , I got you . One , two , three . ( Air rushing ) - I got you , I got you . - I 'm good . I 'm good . You got it ready ? - Can 't keep this thing in tune anyway . - And you play like shit . Okay , what 's next ? Go ! - You got it ? - Next . - Next . - Here . Get your bag , I 'II get the other one . - ( Roars ) - What the fuck ? Mel : What is it ? What 's going on ? - Cory : Sal , what 's wrong with you ? - I just saw something . - What ? - I don 't know ! I don 't know ! - Sal man , I need you . - I know . Okay . Uh , I think that 's it . You 're next , go . - What , are you holding out on us ? - Look man , that stays , all right ? AII right , well , I 'm keeping something too , huh ? - Whoo ! - That 's it , come on . ( Grunting ) - A little help . - ( grunts ) ( panting ) Is it better ? Maybe . I don 't know . This doesn 't make sense . The systems aren 't supposed to fail like this . So how long do we have ? Sara ? Sara , how long do we have ? We 'II be out of fuel in less than an hour . ( Thunder rumbling ) What are you saying ? When we took off the tanks were only half full . No . We 're gonna draw straws and the winner gets the parachute . - Oh , come on . - Cory : It 's a good idea . - What ? - He 's right . I can 't believe you 're even talking about this . - No , guys , it 's too dangerous . - Too dangerous ? Is that a joke ? We don 't know who put that chute here . We don 't even know if it 's packed properly . - None of us have even skydived before . - How hard can it be ? Look , we could be at 10,000 feet . We could be at 1,000 . You jump when we 're too low you 're gonna hit the ground before your chute opens . If it even opens . Are you crazy ? Too low ? We 've been going up the whole time . Have we ? The first thing that they teach you at flight school is just how disoriented you get when you can 't see the ground . There 's no way that we 're putting that on . There 's no way . You know what ? Screw this . Mel , take it . - What are you doing ? - You 're putting it on . - What are you doing , man ? - I 'm saving her life , man . Take it . Hey , back off , Cory . I 'm not gonna let you die like this . Look , man , I said back off . We 're drawing straws like I said before . She 's your girlfriend , man . You gonna let her die ? Yeah , she 's my girlfriend . - I 'm gonna decide . - Decide what ? God , you 're a fucking asshole . You know that ? Oh yeah ? I 'm the asshole here , right ? Mel : Stop it ! Quit it ! - You want some ? - Sara : What the hell is going on ? - Mel , Mel , stop them . - Stop it ! Both of you stop it ! That the best you got , man ? That 's what they teach you in school ? Just fuck off , man . Fuck off . No wonder you lost every wrestling match . Fuck you . I didn 't lose every match . ( Camera beeping ) Shit . Sal : Un-fucking-believable . Un-fucking-believable . Give me that . - Stop ! No ! - Give me it , Mel . Gimme . - Leave her alone ! - Stop it ! Everybody stop it ! Do you want to get out of this alive ? Do you ? Do you want to get out of this alive ? Well , then I 'm the pilot and what I say goes . Is that acceptable to you ? Is that acceptable , yes or no ? Is that acceptable ? Good . Now everyone just stay in your seats and shut up . Bruce : We 're gonna die like them . We 're gonna die like them . What do you mean ? We 're gonna die like them . We have to get down . Bruce , we 're all scared , okay ? Just take it easy . No no , we have to land the plane . We have to get the plane down . Dude , just relax . No , look , we have to get me down . We have to get me down now . - We have to get down ! - Somebody help ! - Sal , someone , stop him ! - Get me down ! Get me down ! Got to get down now ! No ! No ! No ! I 'm not gonna die like them ! I 'm not gonna die like them ! - I am not gonna die like them ! - Relax ! Relax , all right ? Just relax . There we go . There we go . Just relax . Sal , what are you doing ? There we go . There we go . There it is . Put him down . Mel : Who 's flying the plane ? Autopilot . Is he breathing ? Yeah , he 'll be fine . I just put him to sleep . What was all that shit he said about people dying ? He must have meant his parents . They died in a car accident . - Are you sure ? - If he 's so afraid of flying , - why 'd he come ? - Because I invited him . You know what ? That 's right , I forgot . He 's a freak and he 's in love . We 're not in love . Yeah ? Does he know that ? What are you gonna do , huh ? You gonna have one last weekend of pity sex with him and just trash him like a leaky rubber , huh ? Is that what you were gonna do ? That 's cold . That 's cold , sweetie . You don 't know a thing about me or what I want . Yeah , whatever . - We 'd better tie him up . - Tie him up ? Isn 't that a bit extreme ? You want him to go all kamikaze on us again , huh ? You got a blade , man ? AII right . - ( Groans ) - Sara . It 's getting really cold in here , Sara . I 'm sorry . This cabin isn 't pressurized . - Isn 't there a heater ? - Yeah there is , but we can 't use it . Why ? Because it runs on the main fuel supply and we need every last drop for the engines . Oxygen is the real problem . What do you mean ? Above 13,000 feet we 're gonna start suffering from hypoxia . Hypoxia ? What 's hypoxia ? It 's oxygen deprivation ... Shortness of breath , headaches , nausea . I thought you said this thing could go to 24,000 feet . It can , but most people don 't bring it above 10 . That 's why there 's no breathing gear . Damn it . If my elevator worked I could do a controlled descent and we could all get our bearings . Is there a way that we can clear the jam ? I mean , like an access panel ? There 's nothing we can do from here . Somebody would have to go outside and do it manually . What do you mean , go outside ? On the tail ? No no no , that ... screw that . We 're not doing that . That 's ridiculous . That 's your attitude for everything , isn 't it ? - Just give up . - What , do you want to go out there ? Huh ? Be my guest . ( Rattling ) Oh no . Sal : What now ? The deicing boots are malfunctioning . The what ? They keep ice from building up on the wings . Aren 't you supposed to check all this shit before we take off ? I didn 't know we were gonna be flying this high , did I ? So ice builds up , what does that mean ? It means we don 't generate enough lift . And if it blocks the ailerons then we 're really screwed . Oh , perfect . ( Panting ) Mel , what 's wrong ? Are you okay ? Just a headache . What are you doing ? You heard her . We just ran out of options . Cory , you 're not going out there . Beats sitting in here waiting to die . Sara : No no no , Cory . You can 't go out there . There 's nothing to hang onto . You 'll be blown right off . - That 's what the rope 's for . - Listen to her , okay ? She knows what she 's talking about . - Look , take this with you at least . - The parachute ? Look , I 've been free climbing since I was 12 , okay ? - It 'II only slow me down . - My hero . Dude , you want to go out there ? Huh ? Feel free . Be my guest . - It might not even work . - What ? Look , will it or won 't it ? Sara , you 're the expert here . Will this work or won 't it ? Enough pressure on the elevator will be able to free it . - So yeah . - Okay . - AII right , can you slow us down ? - I 'II try . - Help me , help me . - There 's got to be another option . - No , there isn 't . - There 's no other way , you heard her . See that rope back there ? Get it and tie it to something . - Make sure it 's tight . - Yeah yeah , okay okay . I got it . I got it . Piece of cake . Who the hell taught you how to tie a knot ? - What is that ? - It 's a knot . Like this . - You sure you 're ready for this , man ? - What 's that supposed to mean ? - It means you 've been drinking , fucko . - Oh my God , come on . - Not now . - I just need to know I can trust you . Give me this . Is this enough for you , huh ? - You satisfied now ? - Okay okay okay okay . - I can fucking do this , all right ? - Okay , let 's do it . Okay , I 'm reducing power . - Okay . - Cory , come here . Yeah yeah ? What ? - Come back . - Okay . No , promise me you 'II come back . I promise . It 's okay . I 've done this 100 times . Just not quite this high . It 's fine . Fly , okay ? It 's okay . It 's all right . Keep me in focus , okay ? All right ? Okay . It 's fine . Okay , let 's do it . Come on . ( exhales ) Okay . ( Breathing heavily ) Rock and roll . What 's wrong ? My weight distribution 's off . We 're not balanced . - Cory ! - Jesus Christ , Sara , come on ! Uh ... ( grunting ) Oh my God . Sara ! Come on . Okay . Oh , that 's better . How 's he doing ? He 's good , he 's good . He 's all right . - You 're all right , right , buddy ? - It 's too far . - I think I 've got to jump . - What ? Are you crazy ? - No ! - ( screams ) Jesus . - There he is . There he is . - Come on , Cory . There we go . There we go . He 's on the tail ! He 's on the tail . Come on , man . Come on . ( Thumps ) Come on . Come on , Cory . Come on . ( Engine revs ) ( laughs ) I 've got control back . You did it , bro ! Ha ha ! ( Roaring ) Damn it , Mel , put that thing away . Come help me . Come on . - Okay . - How 's he doing back there ? He 's not gonna make it . He 's freezing . Give me your hand . Give me your hand . Come on , Cory ! For Christ 's sake , Sara , keep it steady . I 'm trying . Come on , Cory , right here . On the count of three you 're gonna take my hand , all right ? AII right , ready ? One ... two ... three ! No ! Jesus ! Fuck ! Hold on ! Oh shit . Shit ! Oh my God ! ( Grunts ) ( groaning ) ( groans ) Do you have him ? Sal , what 's happening ? Oh shit . ( Thunder rumbles ) ( panting ) Somebody talk to me . Sal ? ( Sighs ) He 's gone . What ? He 's gone . No . No . The fucking rope broke . He 's gone . No . No no . I saw something . ( Sobbing ) No . No no . - I thought I saw it before , now I know . - No . Could you just shut up and listen to me a second ? Just shut up and listen to me for a second , okay ? It got him . I saw it . It was huge . It was fucking huge . It was black . You didn 't see it ? You didn 't hear it ? Aren 't you listening to me ? It fucking grabbed him . I saw it ! What does it matter ? Cory 's dead . Yeah well , better him than us . Sara : No . Just get us down now . Right now . - No . - Just land this plane now . - Just get it down now ! - I will ! Right now . Right now . Can anybody see anything ? More god-damn clouds . What happened ? Where are we ? Why the hell am I tied up ? It 's for your own good . We 're not climbing anymore . That 's right . We 're gonna be okay now . We are ? Where 's Cory ? Sara ? You killed him . He trusted you . And you killed him . I don 't know what you 're talking about , Mel . This didn 't break . It was cut . Are you listening to yourself right now ? Huh ? Listen to yourself right now . You sound fucking crazy . He saved our lives . Where were you when I needed help pulling him in , huh ? - Where were you ? - I was there . - Oh , I must have blinked . - I hit my head . I 'm sure you did . But you know what ? None of that matters now . - Your boyfriend is gone . - What ? You heard me . Mel , it was an accident . Okay ? You know it was . You 're fucking crazy . I 'm the crazy one ? You just accused me of killing someone . Guys , stop ! Would someone please tell me what happened to Cory ? He went outside on the tail to fix the elevator . Sal thinks something grabbed him . Look , I know what I saw . Okay ? I know what I saw ! It was real . What was ? What was real ? - We don 't know . - Bullshit . Bullshit . Bullshit . There 's a monster out there and it 's still out there . Sal , just shut up , okay ? Just shut up . How long are you gonna keep me tied up for ? Till we know we can trust you . Of course you can trust me . Can I really ? You completely lost it earlier and you lied to me . About what ? Your parents weren 't killed in a car crash , were they ? Were they ? No . Mel , can you come up here , please ? Keep an eye out . For what ? Anything . You know how I said we were gonna have that talk later ? Look at me . We 're having it now . I knew your mother . What ? I knew your mother . What are you talking about ? I was there when it happened . When what happened ? I was one of the passengers . ( Screaming ) When they pulled me out of that lake half my bones were broken . And I spent six months in the hospital just trying to walk again . So you 're saying you 're the Taylors ' kid ? I thought you said your last name was Parker . The Parkers are my foster parents . ( Sniffles ) So you knew who I was when we first met . I didn 't want it to affect things between us . - I knew you would freak out . - Jesus , man . Freak her out ? God , you are some fucking death magnet . Jesus , we 're so fucked . We 're so fucked ! Aaah ! Fuck ! What did you think would happen when I went off to McGill ? You think I 'd fly home every other weekend to see you ? Our lives are going in different directions . You 're so different than I thought you were . You 're a liar . You make up this story like you know my mom . That 's a sick bullshit fantasy . You had to know that this couldn 't last . You had to know that . Tell me you knew that . A fantasy ? A fantasy ? ! Your mom killed my parents . My life is so screwed up . Your mom destroyed my life . You don 't know shit . I figured it out though . Figured what out , Bruce ? - We 're meant to be together , Sara . - Meant to be together ? - Are you crazy ? - I love you . What did you just say ? I love you . Don 't say that . Mayday mayday mayday . Yankee Zulu X-ray . Position and altitude unknown . Can anybody read me ? Can someone please untie these ropes ? Sure , I 'II get right to it . Sara : Mayday mayday , Yankee Zulu X-ray . ( Squealing ) Mel : What is it ? I don 't know . Let us hear it . ( Squealing ) It 's that thing . It 's that thing . It 's back . It 's back . No , it 's distortion . It has to be . - Oh come on . - No , that 's not distortion . Sara : Whatever it is , there 's a rational explanation . Yeah ? Well , good . ' Cause I think we 'd all like to hear it , Sara . What do you want me to say ? Hypoxia makes you see things or hear things . Not the same things . Look , the altimeter says we should be in outer space . How do you explain that right now ? - Some magnetic interference . - Sara , you heard it . - It 's not normal . - Yeah , I heard something . It could be crosstalk or interference with sunspots ... - Something . - Oh my God , sunspots ? Are you kidding me ? You 're not a radio expert , Sal . None of us are . Sal : AII right , let 's just be real . I think there 's something we all need to admit right now , don 't you think ? Admit what ? Come on , Sara , we 've been going down for what , like 20 minutes ? Come on , tell me you 're not thinking the same thing I am . Spit it out . Where the hell is the ground ? ( Panting ) Sara . Sara , your dad , he works on secret projects , right ? - Yeah , no ... - Like for the air force . - Yeah . - Yeah , good point . Remember the mechanic we saw ? You know , the camel jockey . Well maybe , just maybe , he rigged the plane to kill the colonel 's daughter . - How 's that ? - That 's not what I meant . Okay , what if we don 't need to come down ? What if we never took off ? Mel . Look , just hear me out , okay ? What if we 're just part of some big experiment ? You know , like something to see how people react to stress . - Mel , that 's impossible . - Why ? Because he doesn 't even know we 're here . - What ? - What the fuck ? He thinks we 're driving to the concert . He doesn 't even know I have my pilot 's license . Are you shitting me , Sara ? He 's paranoid . He 's convinced I 'II end up the same way my mom did . Well , Jesus , I wonder what gave him that idea . Look , it has nothing to do with that , okay ? The point is is it 's not some giant government conspiracy . Why not ? Because things like that don 't happen in real life . There wasn 't any information released on the plane that hit us . What plane ? The one that killed her mom and my parents . Didn 't you hear the rumours ? There 's no record of it . - Lt just appeared out of nowhere . - The ghost plane theory ? Really ? It 's just like we 're trapped in a hanger . We 're plugged into some sort of simulation . - Or maybe it 's drugs . - Drugs ? Like those LSD tests they did back in the ' 60s . Yeah well , one hell of a bad trip we 're having . Well , it makes more sense than anything else . Well , shit . I say we find out . - Sara : What ? - I don 't know , jump . I mean , in dreams , I don 't know , you 're falling and you wake up . Maybe it 's the same in this situation , huh ? Maybe it 's the same . You know what ? I think you 're on to something , Sal . Why don 't you go ahead and give it a shot ? Maybe it 's just the booze talking , I don 't know . I don 't know . But right now ... right now it 's saying shut the fuck up and drink me . So you know what ? - I 'm gonna do just that . - ( can pops open ) Cheers . ( Gasps ) ( woman laughing ) ( birds chirping ) Wake up , Sara . Sara . Wake up , Sara . Sara , wake up . Sara . Sara . Sara , wake up . Sara ! Sara , wake up ! Something hit us . We need you to fly the plane . Sara ! ( Thunder rumbling ) Sara ! Sara ! Come on , wake up . Jesus . ( Air rushing ) Sara , come on ! Sara ! ( High-pitched whine ) ( sobbing ) I can 't take this . - I can 't take this anymore . - Mel . No no no , Mel , just stay with me . - I can 't . - Stay with me , Mel . It 's gonna be okay . I promise . - Okay ? - I can 't . It 's gonna be okay . ( Sobbing ) ( roaring ) ( shrieking ) - What 's happening ? - Oh no . ( Roars ) ( screams ) Sal : What ? It 's got us . - What is it ? - Shake it off ! Am I the only one that 's gone completely insane or did anybody else just hallucinate something attacking us ? - Calm down , Sal . - Calm down ? That thing is gonna rip us apart , Sara . Whatever it is , it 's gone , okay ? Just relax . You would say that ' cause you put us in this situation . Sara : This isn 't about me , okay ? This isn 't my fault . - Bruce , what are you doing ? - ( Bruce muttering ) Bruce , stop it . I 'm serious . Mel : Sal . Sal , I think I ... - I think I took too many . - Mel . - I think I took too many . - Mel . Mel ! Mel , Jesus Christ . Mel , come on . No no . Don 't do this . Come on , come on . Hey hey , baby . Baby . Baby . Guys , something 's wrong with Mel . - What happened to her ? - I don 't know . I can 't feel a pulse . - Fuck , man , I think she OD 'd . - OD 'd on what ? On her fucking pills ! What do you think she OD 'd on ? Mel ! No , baby Mel . No no no no . - We 've got to get her breathing . - Mel , come on ! Please please help her . Please . - What the fuck are you doing ? - It 's okay . Move move . Don 't you fucking hurt her . Please . Come on , Mel . Come on . - Jesus Christ , Mel . - Come on , come on ! Come on , Mel . Come on , baby . Come on . Come on . Don 't fucking die on me . Don 't die on me . Come on . Fucking hurt her ... Don 't hurt her ! ( Coughs ) Yeah yeah , I 'm here . I 'm here . Come on , I 'm here . I 'm here . Oh , thank God . Sal : Here we go . Here we go . You 're okay . You 're okay . Come here . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay . Here you go , baby . ( Crying ) You 're okay . Look , baby , I never ... I never meant to say any of those things . I didn 't mean it . I didn 't mean it , I swear . I didn 't mean any of those things I said to you . - Sal . - What , baby , what ? About Cory . No , we don 't need to talk about that now . We don 't need to talk about that now , baby . - Mel : Yes , we do . - Sal : No , we don 't . No , we don 't . No , we don 't . - Mel : I 'm so sorry . - Sal : It 's okay . Baby , it 's okay . Mel : I 'm so sorry . I never meant to hurt ... ( screams ) Mel ! ( Screaming ) Sara : No ! ( Wailing ) What the hell was that ? ( Screaming ) It got her . It fucking got her . It 's gonna get us too . It 's gonna fucking get us too . ( Both sobbing ) There 's no way . It can 't be . - There 's no way . - What did you do ? What did you do , you fuck ? - What the fuck did you do ? - Sal ! You fucker ! I 'm gonna fucking kill you ! - Gonna fucking kill you ! - No ! What are you gonna do ? No , please don 't , please don 't ! - No ! - ( Bruce screaming ) Sal , let him go ! Sal , stop ! - Sal ! - I 'm gonna fucking kill you . - Stop it , no ! - ( all screaming ) You fuck ! - Sara , get me up ! - Bruce , Bruce , come here . ( Grunts ) Don 't let go of me . - Please don 't let go of me ! - Hold on . ( Whimpers ) - No ! - ( screams ) Sal ! Sara ! ( Roars ) ( sobbing ) No . No ! No-ooo . No . ( sobbing continues ) ( door closing ) ( sobbing ) They 're dead . They 're all dead . ( Sobs ) God , what have I done ? What have I done ? It 's not your fault . Yes it is . I 'm the pilot . I 'm responsible . He knew it . My dad knew it . He knew it from the day we buried her . I wasn 't allowed to see her body . AII I remember is the flowers on her casket . Tulips . Tulips were her favourite . ( Sobbing ) God , I miss her . I miss her so much . I ... I never believed she was really gone . But I thought maybe she was lost somewhere , up there in that ... And if I learned to fly , I could ... I could find her and bring her home . I want her to come home . This happened before and it 's happening again . No . Bruce , no . This isn 't about your parents or my mom or any conspiracy , okay ? It 's not about that ! You 're right , Sara . I know that now . Then what ? It 's me . What are you talking about ? 10 years ago on that plane I saw ... I saw something I ... There ... there was a storm . Turbulence . A cover of a magazine . I was scared . I imagined it happening to us . It did . No , that 's insane . That 's just a coincidence . Then what do you call this , huh ? What ? A comic ? Just look . What ? - Cory : Coz , we should turn around . - Sara : I 'm trying . Cory : 20,000 feet ? Sal : Where the hell is the ground ? Mel : You killed him . This didn 't break . It was cut . What are you saying ? This ... This is some kind of curse ? Aren 't you listening ? I made these things come true just by thinking about them . I should have never gotten on this plane ! - Why , because you 're scared to fly ? - Don 't you get it ? That 's when it happens ... When I 'm really scared . So you 're telling me that this is some kind of fantasy world come to life ? Sara , look around . This isn 't fantasy . It 's a nightmare . - ( Gasps ) - ( shrieks ) I 'm not gonna let us die ! - You 're never gonna out fly it . - We 'll see . Hang on . ( Shrieks ) ( shrieking continues ) Oh shit . Shit shit shit shit . ( Screams ) Another hit like that and we 're dead . I told you . I told you . I told you . Are you really causing this ? Is this really because of you ? Then prove it . Make that thing go away . - I don 't know how . - Make it go away ! - I don 't know how ! - ( roaring ) Bruce , man is what he wills himself to be . Sartre , right ? Stop being such a pussy and face your fears . Face your fears ! - ( Shrieking ) - ( screaming ) Bruce , please stop . Do it , Bruce . ( screams ) Bruce , Bruce ! Bruce ! Jesus . It is you . Mayday mayday mayday , Yankee Zulu X-ray . Can anyone read me ? ( Static ) Mayday mayday mayday , Yankee Zulu X-ray . ( Static ) This is Lakeview Centre . Received your mayday . - What is your emergency ? - I just got through to ground . We 're gonna make it . You didn 't mean it , did you ? Mean what ? That kiss . I care about you , Bruce . You know that . Bruce , Bruce ! - I can 't help it . - Yes you can ! Oh no . Bruce , move . ( Glass shatters ) ( shrieks ) - Get us out of here . - It 's not that simple . Why not ? Just think us somewhere else . You don 't understand . I 've never made anything good happen in my life . What if I can 't ? ( Screaming ) Bruce : No ! Bruce ! - Sara ! - ( screams ) Sara ! Bruce ! - Sara ! - Bruce , your parents , Bruce . Think of your parents . My parents ? They wouldn 't want you to die like this . They 'd want you to survive . Don 't you understand ? You can be with them again . All you have to do is imagine it . - Sara ! - Imagine it . ( Sara groans ) No-ooo ! ( Sara gasping ) What happened ? I did it . I thought of somewhere else . Oh no . ( Screaming ) Where the hell did he come from ? - Was that ... - I think so . - Did we just ... - Yeah . If you 're gonna do your thing , now 's the time . It 's already done . Mom , Mom ! I 'm okay , sweetie . Everybody gets one near miss , right ? Do you think they made it ? I hope so . Hi , I 'm Sara .

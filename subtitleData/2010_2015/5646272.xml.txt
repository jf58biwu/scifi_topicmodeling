Something 's happened . At school . Mr Chandra called me into his office . He thinks I should take my A-levels in June . You 've just started sixth form . I know , but , I 'm clever , aren 't I ? It 's why he thinks I could get into Oxford . He says I could go to university a year early . Mum ? And you think now 's the time to be telling me this ? Bomb activation initiated . Bomb activation initiated . Bomb activation initiated . Goodbye , Miss Smith ! My ship is ready to go . I 'd offer you a lift , but you 're all tied up . K9 ! Stop the bomb ! - Affirmative ! - You escaped ? Deactivating timer mechanism , mistress ! We warned you but you wouldn 't listen ! You think you can stop me with a bucket ? A bucket full of vinegar . - Bum ! - Not again . Bomb neutralised , Mistress ! Mum ? Oxford ? I think you need to do what 's right for you . I think you should go . I don 't get why he wants to go to uni . He could learn everything from K9 and Mr Smith . He 's got to meet new people , do new things . Don 't you want to see the world ? I 've seen it . There 's space . Here he is . Four A stars . Well done ! I 'm so proud . - Come here , you , well done . - Thank you . Never doubted you , man . I 'm going to university ! I 'm going to Oxford ! I was so happy . Everything was going to be fantastic . But I was scared . It started back then . But this week , I just got really scared . Initiating scan . I was just going to call you . I thought we 'd have scrambled eggs . I guess I should watch . This time next week I 'll be making my own breakfast . Alien object of Alphamatraxin origin . I just saw Rani . First day back at school , isn 't it ? It must seem strange not being with them . Mum , have I made the right choice ? Of course you have . Remember your first day at Park Vale ? You were terrified , that turned out all right . - We were attacked by Slitheen . - Apart from that ! - They turned the sun off . - And apart from that . Luke , you 're allowed to be worried . You 're only human . Are you really going to make scrambled egg ? Do you remember what happened last time ? I think I can manage , thank you . " Mum just set the kitchen on fire again . - " Are you coming round tonight ? " - Luke ? - What , you 're not going to text back ? - Later . He should be here . He should be here , boring us with facts about dead kings - and space and dinosaurs . - I know . Four days , and then that 's it , no more Luke . We 've got these . And he 'll be home for holidays and Christmas . What , you 're going to see him later ? When my dad went , he just went . Disappeared overnight . Luke needs to get used to us not being around . Come on . I got these from Gita . You 're lucky , she wanted to help . You 've made a start . Not bad . I thought we 'd get you some new clothes . I don 't know what 's in but Rani can help , and we 'll get you looking all cool . Is " cool " the right word ? Is " cool " cool ? - Has he called you back ? - No . He 's probably just sad . I know what 'll cheer you up . Come on ! It 's your old car . - Not anymore . - You 're giving it to me ? I 've had it done up . MOT , everything . You don 't want your mum driving you to uni . Come on , get in ! See how it feels ! So ? So why don 't I just drive off now ? - What ? - Are you even going to miss me ? You want me to pack and get new clothes , and it 's like you can 't wait for me to go . For years , I was alone . Just K9 and me . You gave me my life back , you gave me something real to live for . I 'm terrified of what 's going to happen when you go . I 'm so scared . - Why ? - Because . It feels like I 'm losing you . Everything 's changing so fast . But whatever happens , this is your home . Your friends are here , I 'm here , and I 'll always be here for you . Well , of course I 'm going to miss you . Mistress ? No , I shouldn 't laugh . The thing is , I 'll miss him a bit . But he 's not really my son . - Master Luke was created by the Bane . - Exactly . He 's good for doing the crossword and emptying the bins , but he was going on earlier , K9 . " Will you miss me ? " I was thinking , " Oh , for goodness sake , grow up ! " Actually , I 'm not going to miss you . I don 't really like you , " once you started living here , I was stuck with you . " He will be gone soon . K9 , I can 't wait . Luke was the biggest mistake of my life ! Hi , Rani . Handbag . - She freaking out much ? - No , she 's fine . And you ? I had a nightmare last night . What ? I thought you couldn 't dream . Neither did I. The Bane didn 't include it in my genetic make-up . You told your mum ? This is huge . It 's just a dream . Everybody has them , don 't they ? I suppose it must be because you 're leaving home . Everything 's a bit intense and that 's just ... activated the dream switch . You 're growing up , getting old . I 'm growing up so I start having nightmares ? Great ! And the rest of us get spots . I wouldn 't worry about it . You 've not told Clyde , have you ? He 'll only take the mick . I haven 't seen him . He 's been busy . I saw Luke this morning . He says he hasn 't see you in a few days . - D 'you fancy going round later ? - I 've got football . - Don 't be like this . - Like what ? Your best mate 's going away , don 't pretend you 're not bothered . What am I supposed to do ? Cry and beg him to stay ? - We should be happy for him ! - I am ! - Tell him ! - Maybe I will ! - Good ! - Good ! - I actually have to be in there . - Right . Night , Mum . Night ! - Lukey Boy ! What are you doing here ? - I don 't know . I thought you were the big man , heading off to university ? - It 's not fair , really , is it ? - What isn 't ? - You . Your brain 's not normal . - Is Rani jealous ? I 'm working so hard to get out of here and he does it all a year early . - It 's just showing off . - That isn 't how it is . You act like , " I 'm so sweet and I 'm so scared , " - but you 're just a freak . - Super geek . Alien freak . Did someone say aliens ? It 's OK , Sarah Jane . We 'll still be here . - We 'll help you stop the aliens . - I 'll be coming back . Who says we 'll want you back ? Who are you ? I 'm coming for you . Who are you ? Where am I ? It 's just a dream . I know . I know this isn 't real . But it isn 't just a dream . It can 't be . Poor little Lukey . Who are you ? I live in your nightmares . I feed on them . And yours are just ... beautiful . Morning . What 's up ? I didn 't get much sleep . - I had a nightmare . - What ? I had one Monday as well . Right ! Mr Smith , I need you ! I 'm sure it 's nothing . I 'm just a bit scared about Friday . How can I help you , Sarah Jane ? Scan Luke . He 's been having dreams . I thought Luke didn 't dream . That 's why I 'm asking you to scan him . Do you require everything to be pointed out to you , Mr Smith ? Your anxiety levels are increased , which is to be expected , but I can 't detect any abnormalities . So , I 'm fine ? Perhaps I should have someone else look you over ? Mum , I 'm fine . Mr Smith said I 'm fine . - I 'm a big boy now . - Sorry . How will I cope when you 're gone ? I 'm going to be calling you . I 'll just talk to myself then . It 's Clyde . He wants to meet up . - What , now ? - This afternoon , in school . Make sure you do some packing before ... OK , Mum . Hello ? Surprise ! Did you do this ? You 're my best mate ! As if I 'd let you leave without a party ! You hear me ? It 's time to party ! - So , you OK ? - Yeah . Good . It 's just ... I 'm not used to this sort of thing . Me neither . So , we 're cool ? - We 're always cool . - Cool . And you don 't want , like a a hug or anything ? So was this your idea ? With a little nudge from you know who . - She 's cool , isn 't she ? - Yeah . - You should go and dance with her . - What ? What 's that supposed to mean ? Why would I want to dance with Rani ? I don 't want to dance with her . Clyde wants to show you his moves ! Clyde ? Rani ? Hello , Luke ! - Who are you ? - I 'm the Nightmare Man . You belong to me . But what are you doing here ? You 're in the real world ! - I 've got to wake up ! - Your dreams are giving me such power over you , Luke . You can 't say my name . You can 't tell anyone about me . I 'm in your head , Luke . Your fear is delicious ! Have you been asleep ? I dunno . - Is that more cake ? - Where ? Did you have another nightmare ? Yeah . There was this ... This ... I can 't say it . You 're really scared , aren 't you ? It 's just a nightmare cos you 're stressed out about Friday . You 're going to be OK . Come on . Let 's show Clyde how it 's done . You can 't say my name , you can 't tell anyone about me . I 'm in your head , Luke . And this is the attic . Mr Smith ! I need you ! Mum ? What do you think , Josh ? Do you like it ? - He 's so sweet . - He 's my new baby boy . Sarah Jane , I 'm receiving a call from Luke . Take a message . I 've got Josh now . Have they forgotten you already ? Photos of Luke ... gone . His old school books ... gone . You getting rid of that as well ? It 's all over , isn 't it ? Come on , in we go . What are you ? What do you want ? What do you want ? Life . Your nightmares , your fear , they 're giving me such power . One more little nightmare from you , and I 'll be in your world . You can 't ! I 'll send everyone into an eternal sleep , a whole world of nightmares for me to feed upon . And I 'll grow stronger and stronger . It 's going to be so good . And it 's all because of you , Lukey . - Where are you from ? - What ? What planet are you from ? I 'm from nowhere . I 'm from everywhere . You 're just an alien , and I 've stopped aliens before . But wouldn 't it be terrifying if I was so much more than that ? Get ready for the end of the world , Luke . An eternal sleep of nightmares . And it 's all your fault ! Here 's to Luke 's last night on Bannerman Road ! Cheers . Cheers , Luke . You all right , mate ? You 'd tell us if there was something wrong ? He 's gonna be fine . This time tomorrow , he 's going to be in a brand-new , exciting place . Come on , my turn . Move over . - Come on , Rani . - Cheesy grin for Mum , please . He 'll forget about us , I 'm telling you . It 's lovely . He 's such a lightweight . - Don 't go to sleep . Please . - I 'm not . I 'm just tired . You can 't say my name , you can 't tell anyone about me . I 'm supposed to be going out there and living my life . It 's not going to happen . The world 's going to end , and it 's my fault . Because he 's coming for me , you see . He 's been waiting for me for years , and this week , he ... I can hear him . He 's coming , so if you 're watching , just keep watching , because ... Lukey Boy ! He 's the Nightmare Man , and I can 't stop him . Mum , I 'm sorry . That 's why I 'm trying now so hard to stay awake . But you can 't . And I 'm coming , Luke . It 's time , go to sleep ... Sweet dreams ! I 'm real ! I 'm here and I 'm real ! Please ! Can anyone hear me ? Let me out ! Let me out ! Mum ! Where am I ? Mum ! I 'm going to stop you ! Luke 's Nightmare Man is a Vishclar from the Saretti dimension . It 's not real , it 's just a nightmare ! I always knew you were a stupid boy . Sarah Jane ? I shouldn 't be here ! I don 't know what I 'm doing . You are a journalist , aren 't you ? My sensors indicate Master Luke is asleep . He recorded that video because he knew we 'd find it and he knew we 'd save him . This is a dream and you need to wake up . I know , K9 . I 've tried , but I can 't .

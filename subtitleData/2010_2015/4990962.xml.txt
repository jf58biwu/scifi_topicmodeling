 The world as we know it has ceased to exist . In just four years , the earth 's atmosphere has heated up by 10 ° Celsius . People are fighting for survival . Water and food supplies are quickly running out . Social order is collapsing . Alex . Alex ! Please ! Alex ! You have to go . They 're coming . No . No . It won 't work . Leave me here . Hurry up . Go now . It 's a trap . Run ! Run ! Leo , that 's not funny . There 's nothing coming out . This works too , doesn 't it ? Last petrol can . Button up my shirt . Look for the next exit . Do you think it will work ? That 'll last for another 80 kilometres . What if it 's no better up there ? - What if there 's nothing up there ? - At least we will have tried . Come on ! There we go . I just saw a bird . - What ? - Yes . Quite a sight . It was flying the same direction as we 're going . See ? It 's a sign . Yeah , birds know where the water is . Isn 't it too dangerous ? No , there 's nobody around . I 'll have a look around . What 's so special about him ? We help each other . We wouldn 't be here without him . We wouldn 't be here without his car . Shit , it 's coming off . Give me that stuff . Go in and see what else you can find . I 'll check the tanks . Put on your jacket . Scientists clueless : Solar storms with record highs Somebody was sleeping here . Leonie ? Leonie ? You can 't just take off . What are you doing anyway ? Toilets , water lines and heating pipes - there 's always water . Something Mum showed me . Wait outside where Phillip can see you . I 'll look around the back . OK ? - Did you hear what I said ? - Yes . Leo , you won 't believe it . Look what I just ... Phillip ! Shit ! - Where did he go ? - I couldn 't tell . What did he take ? - Let 's get out of here . - He stole at least a week 's worth of stuff . Why was the car even unlocked ? You 've got the key . Do I have to do all the thinking ? Leonie ! Leo ? - Where is he ? - Let her go . There are three of you . Where is he ? Somewhere outside . Put that down . I said , put it down . Call him over here . Phillip ! Louden Phillip ! Even louder . Phillip ! - I have ... - What ? I have . What ? Petrol . - What are you looking for ? - My watch . Five litres . I could get at least 20 for that . Maybe in the city . You 're not the only people who come by . OK , 15 . Ten , and a can of those peaches . Quick , the cups ! - How far do you want to go ? - Into the mountains . - Why ? - That 's where the water is . Even says so on the bottles . I wouldn 't do that . You got it from the diesel tank . By the sound of it , your oar will only do another 50 kilometres . How do you know ? Give it more gas . It 's the fan belt . The parts aren 't built for this heat . This has nearly had it . And then ? You might find another fan belt in one of these cars . How much petrol do you have left ? How many peaches do you have ? I have a better idea . You find a spare fan belt and take care of the motor . We take you with us and you get something to eat . Another man would be good anyway . Marie will make you a new bandage . The first-aid kit is under my seat . What happened ? Someone knocked me out and I woke up in the blazing sun . - How long were you lying out there ? - Don 't know . Two or three hours . You were lucky . I mean , that you realised it in time . We were all lucky , weren 't we ? Here . You lost it . What 's your name anyway ? Tom . Phillip . Thanks . Watch out ! Got a tow cable ? The three of us push , and the girl drives . That should work , shouldn 't it ? Press the clutch down . Now step on the gas a little . Slowly let out the clutch . Good . Now put it in gear . What do you still need it for ? It 's from my mum . She wasn 't so lucky . Did that hurt ? It sure did . But don 't drive off . More gas ! Even more ! Leonie , turn off the engine ! Turn it off ! From now on you 'll sit in the back , OK ? There 's probably still petrol in the tank . They might have even had some food . Arsehole . Too long . An insult , with five letters . Phillip ? Still too long . Marie ? Is this working ? Yeah , I can hear you . I have to go and pee . When the sun 's gone , OK ? French . Nobody could have survived , eh ' ? They probably continued on foot with their supplies . Or someone was here before us . Let 's check the tank . Marie ? Yes ? Bring me an empty petrol can . Can 't one of you come up ? that 'll take too long . We have to get out of here . I don 't want to leave Leonie alone . Then let her bring us the petrol can . It 's time you got her under control . Marie , is that clear ? Yes . I 'll do it . Hey ! Who cares about him , eh ? As long as we stick together . Can 't we just drive off ? Now . Just the two of us . You have the key , don 't you ? Marie ? Marie , are you there ? - I 'm on my way . - See ? He has you under control . You stay in the car . Don 't go anywhere . - Got it ? - You 're not Mum . Got it ? Mum 's not around any more . I 'm all you have now . Lock the door . As soon as we 're somewhere safe we 'll get rid of him . Marie . Here . Straight from Paris . Phillip ... You don 't have to worry . I got my period . Leonie ? Someone 's here . Where 's Leonie ? - Where 's Phillip ? - We have to get out of here . Come on . What happened ? Tom ? Talk to me . They drove off with Leonie just as we got up there . It was a trap . I shouldn 't have left her alone . We 'll look for her , OK ? Phillip ! Where 's Leonie ? I don 't know . - Maybe they just took the car and let her go . - Just the car ? Everything was in there . Everything . Leonie ? Leonie ? Leonie , tell me where you are . Leonie . Leonie . Nothing . Just static . But I saw smoke , about three kilometres away . Someone 's started a fire . What if they 're no different ? Maybe your boyfriend has a better idea . Let me go ! - We have to do something . - Shh . Wait . Get down . - I 've seen enough . - No . We 'll get her out of there . - Now 's our only chance . - They 'll be back any time now . We 'll take the car , too . Give me the water , and the petrol can . We need it empty . Drink . - I 'm getting sick of this ... - I 'm gonna make a Molotov cocktail . They 'll be back soon . And if you don 't cooperate ... I 'll douse you with your fucking petrol and set you on fire . Quick . Drink it . You go to the car . There are loose cables under the steering wheel . You have to hold the right ones together . - It 's easier than it sounds . - I 'll do it . When this thing goes off , they 'll run towards it . You just concentrate on the cables . Try them all . The engine will start . They 'll be preoccupied . We 'll get the girl and jump into the car with you . Can you do it ? Now . Fire ! Come on . Shit . Drive ! Drive ! - Where 's Leonie ? - Just drive , will you ? Where are they ? Just drive , damn it ! Just drive ! Floor it ! What happened to Leonie ? Marie , we didn 't stand a chance . Shit ! What happened ? What happened ? The whole plan went wrong ! That 's what happened ! What a stupid idea that was . - A Molotov cocktail ! - You didn 't even try ! How was I supposed to cut through an iron chain with a pocket knife ? They were all chained up ! Should I have torn her foot off ? Don 't you get it ? We can 't help her any more . We keep driving . It 's our only chance . Or we 'll die here , both of us . Which ones do I connect ? What are you doing ? Better not be the fan belt . Come on ! Marie ? Marie , I 'm sorry . Let 's stay together . Then help me find her . What 's the range on these ? - No idea . No more than three kilometres . - Then she 's got to be close . - Did she say something ? - I couldn 't understand her . Let me see . You have to go on alone . I 'll be fine . Or do you want to push me on the bike in the scorching sun ? Go ! I won 't hurt you . I thought you were dead . I 'm looking for my little sister . They attacked us and took her with them . There was a whole group of them , and they had several prisoners . They come down every few weeks , catch people and disappear again . That 's just what I heard . I 've never seen it happen . I saw it . You can 't go now . Not during the day and without water . - Can you give me something ? - This is all I have . But we live nearby . We have water . You can rest there . I have to find my sister . I have a son . He 'll help you . Wait here . Our farmers had to slaughter all their livestock . For three years now , there 's been no harvest . Only a few of us survived . My son is all I have left . All I have is my sister . This is what 's left of our field . But you have water . Some , in cliffs and caves . It 's hard to get , but there 's just enough for drinking . Some people say it 's raining above the tree line again . I don 't believe it . What could possibly be up there ? We 're not leaving our farm . Flori ! Get inside ! The Brückners have joined up with us . It 's not always easy , but this way we can get by . Everyone here has his job . Flori , you 're supposed to sleep during the day , not play out in the sun . We have a guest . Grandma Brückner . Thank God she 's not really aware of all this . You can rest here . I 'll wake you up before it gets dark . By then I 'll have spoken to everyone . Here . Excuse me ... Yes ? I had to leave someone behind . He 's badly injured . - He 's lying in a railway tunnel . - Oh , the Berchen Tunnel . - That 's not far from here . - But he can 't walk any more . I 'll send my son to help him . Thank you . It 's all right . Now , more than ever , we need our men . Try to sleep . What 's your name ? Marie . Nice . My name 's Elisabeth . Delta 3 , enemy has fallen Where 's my sister ? Leonie ! - Leonie ! - Please calm down ! What are you people up to ? We don 't have any more livestock . We have to survive . We don 't have any other choice . Please don 't hurt her . Nothing will happen to you two . On the contrary . You 're pretty and healthy . And just the right age . My son needs a wife . Otherwise we can 't keep up the farm . And in a few years , your sister will be ready . For Flori . Think of your little sister . She needs a proper family again . I want to see her . I like that . How you look after your sister . Leonie ! What happened ? Oh , nothing much . It has to be cleaned and bandaged . I 'll send my son to do it . Afterwards we 'll have dinner . You must be hungry . You 'll look beautiful in this . Marie ... Hit her . You 'll like him , he 's my youngest . Why didn 't you hit her ? I 'm scared . I 'm so sorry . Have you seen Phillip ? And Tom ? He 's down there with the others in the barn . How many others are there ? I don 't know . OK , Leonie ... we have to get out of here . The curtains . Give it to me . Look in the closet . - Locked . - Get the backpack . You first . Lie down and don 't move . My mother said ... your sister ... She 's sleeping . My mother said you 're a ... gift from Heaven . What ? Because she found you ... in the church . Close the door . Is he dead ? What ? Come on . Turn off the lamp . There . Don 't look down , look at me . Everything OK ? - Yes . - Not so loud . Get going . Run and hide in the forest . Run , now ! Marie ? The others will be right down . He 's still doing her bandage . How beautiful you look . And it fits you . It used to be mine . Come on , I 'll introduce you to your new family . This is Marie . We need another chair for the girl . What 's taking them so long ? Micha ! Dinner ! Come now . O Lord from whom all things come We thank you for all the gifts you bring The soil from which it springs The sun which made it ripe Dear sun , dear soil We shall never forget your toil - Amen . - Amen . Micha 's still not here . Bruckner , I decide when we eat . Flori . - I 'll get Micha . - No , he 's just coming . Thanks . No ! Marie ! Micha ! Marie ? Come on ! Come on , all together ! Run away ! Hey ! Marie ! Marie ! Get out of here ! Get lost ! Let go ! You 're just like the rest of them . You come crawling , begging for water . I thought you were different . But you 'll burn in the sun . Your mother christened you Marie . What a shame . You 're worth nothing . But your sister ... she 's still young , so young . And with Micha , she 'll have a better life ... Mum ? Mum ? No ! Mum ?

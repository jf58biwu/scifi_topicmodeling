 Previously on " Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. " ... - A hard drive ? - It 's all the research our team 's ever done , encrypted for safekeeping . I 'll give you 24 hours to get the password and get out . After that , bring the girl to me . - You don 't have to shut people out . - Yeah , I do . Eric . There are things about me ... that you wouldn 't like if you knew . He 's Hydra . You all right ? Why did you leave ? I 'm good . I want this . I just got word from Fitz . We need to go right now . Where 's our bus ? - And our team ? - I don 't know . 1x20 - " Nothing Personal " Yeah , it went as expected . S.H.I.E.L.D. implodes , and everyone wants answers . The CIA , NSA , NRO ... them I can handle . But Congress ? Congress is like kindergarten . " Where is this Fridge ? " " What was in there ? " " Who or what is a man-thing ? " I swear I need a cocktail and a lobotomy . But apparently , my every move continues to fascinate them . Tonight 's standard-issue surveillance package includes fake yuppie not checking her texts at the bus stop , imposter homeless man ... mildly offensive ... and the hipster following me looks familiar . I think he 's Russian or ... gone . Pepper , I 'll call you back in 10 . - We need to talk , Agent Hill . - May . A phone call would have done it . - But I appreciate the discretion . - Thought you 'd like the night off . They must hate that you 're going to work for Stark . Most of the intelligence community would like to drop me into a dark hole , but even they can 't mess with Tony 's army of lawyers . So , for now , we 're privatizing global security . - Want to join ? - Coulson needs help . And he won 't take it from me anymore . - Where is he ? - Providence base . And he 's got enough to worry about without obsessing over T.A.H.I.T.I. and who covered it up . You mean besides us . - How much does he know ? - Enough . That they used alien biology , rewrote his memories , and that Fury did it under someone else 's direction . - I want to know who that was . - You 're afraid it was Alexander Pierce . Secretary Pierce was the man in charge ... the only person Fury took orders from ... and he was Hydra . Having a man like that design your brain ? You can understand my concern . Fury took his cues from pretty high up . That much I know . But when I asked him who it was , Fury said that he buried that intel when he decided not to bury Coulson . Maria , this is not the time to wax poetic . Those are his words , not mine . You knew the man . Sometimes he spoke in riddles . - Guess I 'll have to solve it , then . - Hmm . - Unless you want to ask Fury for me . - Fury 's dead . I 'll believe it when I see it . - Drop your weapon ! - 3 minutes and 20 seconds . Really ? If you were my agents , it wouldn 't be for long . Re-sync by wilson0804 Corrections by f1 - Play it again . - It 's the same every time , sir . Fitz . As I said , all internal camera feeds were erased , but the hangar 's landing assist system is separate . The camera tracks movement . So , after we left , everything 's normal until this . An entry log has may leaving the base a few minutes later through the front door ... only her . - And then this . - Holding hands . Soon after , the plane takes off . But that is all we 've got . Where are they going ? And Koenig ? Koenig must have gotten onto the plane somehow . There 's no other way in or out . The blast door and the hangar door are the only exits . And both are undamaged . So nobody attacked the place , and they weren 't running away . - So why ? - Maybe Koenig got orders . From who ? Not Fury . Is there anyone left to give orders ? Aren 't we just improvising at this point ? Still wouldn 't explain why the communication lines were cut or why they left their phones or why May just ... left . May walked away because I told her to . - I was mad , and I was mean . - Then we don 't need her sorry ass . - Excuse me ? - With all the crap we 're facing , this is not the time to pull the ripcord , bail out . I 'll make us some food . We have to eat . Let me help . Uh , no , I 'll get it , actually . You stay here . Simmons . For a minute there in the field , I thought things were normal again , and then ... Why do you think they left us in the dark ? I don 't know . But something will turn up . We just have to stay positive . For Coulson , yeah . I know . - He 's had a rough go of it . - Yeah . Between Garrett and May and seeing Audrey and ... pancakes . Coulson 's upset about pancakes now ? That 's one way to cheer everyone up a bit , don 't you think ? - I 'll see if we have any in stock . - Yeah , I 'll fire up the griddle . Night ? Day . Sir , you 're an expert on analysis . I can see you running scenarios in your head , - so what do you got ? - Best case ... Agent Koenig knows something we don 't . He took a team , kept us in the dark for our safety . Worst-case scenario ? We 've had a wolf in the herd the whole time . Fitz keeps the candy under his bunk . What are you up to ? Just looking for the sat-phone to call the team , make sure everyone 's all right , no one 's blown up . I 've got the phone . I just talked to Coulson a little while ago . - You did ? - Yeah , sorry . Should have told you . They 're okay , but the sooner we get to the location , decrypt that drive ... The sooner we can rendezvous with the team . Exactly . Seemed like a smart play at the time , geo-locking the drive . - I didn 't think it would backfire on us . - It hasn 't backfired . The drive is supposed to be impossible to crack . Pretty specific coordinates , though . You could have picked anywhere in the world . Why a random diner in L.A. ? It was already built into my encryption . Never changed it . But it 's fitting . It 's where I met Mike Peterson . It 's where this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. roller coaster started . Plus , tactically , what do you look for in a jobsite ? Public place , lots of people , multiple exits . Yep . Figured if I ever got in trouble , I 'd be safe there . Oh , you 'll be plenty safe . This , however , is not the answer . What 's the matter ? A girl can 't defend herself ? In this situation , the last thing we can afford is to get pinched on a concealed-weapons charge . You 're right . Again . Couldn 't find any rounds anyway . Hey . We are gonna be okay . I promise , until this thing is over , I 'm not gonna let you out of my sight . Impossible . It can 't be . - No . No . I-I don 't believe it . - Take a breath , Agent Fitz . Don 't tell me to take a breath . Who the hell are you ? I mean , really . Come on . I don 't even know who you are . - I just went through this , remember ? - Don 't touch me . - My S.O. turned out to be a lying son of a ... - Well , not Ward . Okay ? Not Ward . Do you know why ? Because he 's our friend . And Simmons will find something . - Go ahead . Tell him , Jemma . - Let me work , Fitz . - Yeah , but tell him that Ward isn 't ... - Let me work . Something else is at play here , sir . Think about it . They 're just trying to mess with our heads . They wrote that on the wall to scare us . - One step at a time . - We need to get out of here . Simmons will give her report . That 's the next step . He died approximately 10 hours ago of asphyxiation ... after May left the premises . A thin wire was used to strangle him . His trachea is crushed , partially sliced through , so it was done in a hurry . Based on the angle of the lacerations , the killer was at least 6 ' 2 " and strong enough to ... lift him into ... Ward did this . Fitz ! No no no no ... Okay ! Okay ! We need to hold it together . Listen all that anger , all that pain , you need to hold it in and focus it on Skye . She 's alive . And she just walked out of here hand in hand with someone she knows is a murderer because she 's playing him ... just like he played us . Fitz , Fitz ... we have to fix the communications . We have to track that plane . Can you do that ? Good . If I know Skye , she 's got a plan . And we 're gonna find her before Ward figures out what that is . Come on , Skye . What 's your play ? I can 't remember the last time I sat in a restaurant . I know . It 's been all tubes , tunnels , and plane food . - Maybe I will get pie for dessert . - Dessert ? I was hoping we 'd be done by the time I finished coffee . Do you have any idea how long it 'll take to decrypt this drive ? - For you ? I figured 10 minutes . - Not even close . The GPS will take a hot second to calibrate , but I 'm working on a laptop . So even at three cycles per byte , - there are still terabytes of data ... - Spare me the details . - Give me the timeframe . - An hour would be a miracle . Coulson needs this yesterday . My laptop 's not a time machine , Ward . That 's the science . Guess we 're having dessert . Can you grab me a cable ? Think there 's one in the drawer . Thanks . That seemed to work . Fitz is using the jumpjet 's relay to power it . He 's like a ninja with this crap . - How 's he doing ? - Freaking out . But focused on the task , which was good advice . And you ? Trust me , I 'm gonna have a major freak out later . All right . Ward is Hydra . - You know what that means . - Garrett is alive . - And Agent Hand is dead . - So they hit the Fridge . It means they 've got all the weapons they could possibly want . And we didn 't have a clue . So why risk coming back here ? It wasn 't to cross us off . - What do you have that he wants ? - I don 't know . He had all our intel on that drive . All he had to do was make a cop ... He came back for Skye . She must have encrypted that drive , and she was the only one who could crack back into it . So they have to keep her alive . And she can stall for time . Our plane is in Los Angeles . Finally , some good news . Perimeter defenses activated . I should have knocked on wood just then . Multiple contacts on the ground . - They just triggered the gun turrets . - Come on . You 're staring again . I 'm not allowed to do that ? - I told you , it 's a complicated hack . - Um ... you 've mistaken my admiration for impatience . No , it 's impatience . Okay . Sorry . Didn 't mean to stress you out . Maybe you should duck outside . Try again on the sat-phone just to make sure . No . We stick together and we stick to the plan . The sooner you decrypt this hard drive ... The sooner we get to them . I heard you twice the first time . Are you all right ? - You look nervous . - How can you tell , superspy ? Staying unnaturally still to keep from fidgeting , maintaining eye contact to give the impression of confidence . What 's wrong ? The last time I was in this booth , I was sitting across from Mike Peterson ... a good man , and now he 's a murderer . And we are FBI 's most wanted . It 's just like any moment , something could go horribly wrong . Relax . You 're doing great . Hiding what I 'm thinking and feeling ... it doesn 't come as easy for me as it does for you . - Well , it comes with experience . - Yeah , I guess it does . I wish this bunker had a bunker . These doors should hold . It 'll some major artillery to make a dent . Hangar door deactivated . - How ? ! That 's impossible ! - Take cover . Let 's go . It 's not Hydra . It 's special forces . On behalf of the United States armed forces , I order you to stand down . I repeat , stand down . Colonel Talbot ? There have to be better things for you to do than chase four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents . I wasn 't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra , Coulson . - I wouldn 't push it . - I 'm flattered you came in person . Fury 's private base on North American soil ? I just had to see it for myself . If I come out , will you shoot me ? 'Cause then I won 't come out . Hold your fire , soldiers . This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet , Colonel . How the hell did you find it ? I told them . My condolences . " Classified level 10 . T.A.H.I.T.I. project supervisor to Director Fury . " - We 're not criminals . - Great . Then we 'll take you in , and you can tell us all about it . At the very least , you 're fugitives . And running away puts a bit of a guilty stink on it , don 't you think ? We 're not Hydra . We 're agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. That 's the same thing . All right , I 'm gonna tell you how it 's gonna be . You give me actionable intelligence and I 'll allow you to serve time awarded . Your other options are ... pretty much hell . - Do your worst . - We have told you of a known Hydra agent . He 's getting away , and your little intimidation speech is keeping us from saving the life of a fellow agent ... - a friend . - Sister , you haven 't seen intimidation . And right now I 'm you 're only friend . I 'd be careful not to piss me off . The word " agent " implies that your corrupt organization still exists . Your leadership abandoned you for the private sector , and we 're gonna allow that in exchange for valuable assets like yourself . So right now I 'd be thinking hard and fast about exactly what it is that makes you valuable . I am offering you a lifeline here , Coulson . Don 't thank me . Just take it , and we 'll be on our way . Don 't see how thanks are in order , considering you just sold me out and led the U.S. military straight to Fury 's secret base . No , Phil . You led us straight to Fury 's secret base - as part of the deal we made . - You can 't be serious . You and I are gonna turn over these abandoned tunnels to the U.S. Government , who will be ever so grateful to take possession of an enemy stronghold in their backyard . What about my team ? Well , they 're gonna have to go through the system ... - interrogations ... - Not gonna happen . Look , talk to Talbot . Cough up some meaningless intel about this place ... nothing significant , of course , nothing about S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s other installations . You 're still protecting your secrets . Is there anything specific you 're afraid I 'll talk about ? T.A.H.I.T.I. maybe ? - Phil ... - I 'm a liability . - Is that it ? - Grow up , Phil . Of course you 're a liability . But I know you 'll do the right thing . " The right thing ? " That 's funny coming from you . - After everything you and Fury have done ? - Look , it was for your own good . For my own good . I know . I get it . You should have been straight with me . I would have kept your secrets like a good soldier . I always have . But instead , you were worried about me when you should have been worried about anyone else ! You 're right . We should have seen Hydra coming . But after D.C. , they don 't stand a chance . John Garrett does . Garrett ? I heard Ward took care of him . Ward 's his secret weapon . He killed Victoria Hand , then raided the Fridge , and now he 's got Skye , which is where we were headed until you so rudely interrupted to sweeten your deal . I vetted Ward . You want to make this right ? Stop wasting time . Can we move this along ? I 'd like to tear this room apart . Sure , Colonel . Knock yourself out . Get your people . - We need to move . - " We " ? How much longer ? - Half-hour . - You said that a half an hour ago . Weren 't you the one who told me to relax ? Those cops over there keep looking at us . They 're just checking out the waitress . They don 't know you 're pretending to be someone you 're not . Yeah , all right . Who am I pretending to be ? - My impatient boyfriend . - I like that cover . What 's the longest you 've been undercover ? - Like , deep undercover ? - Uh ... - Uh , 16 months . - When was that ? Mm , about five years outside of the academy . I posed as a Russian attaché at the embassy in Warsaw . That 's got to be so hard , living a double life like that ... getting close to people , only to turn on them . I don 't know how Garrett did it . Garrett ? Think about all that time he spent as your S.O. ... getting to know you , being your mentor ... only to lie to your face , betray you like that . It was , uh , difficult to accept . - But thankfully , that 's over . - Because you took care of him . Can we not discuss this right now ? If you had one more moment before you shot him in the back of the head so heroically , if he was sitting right here and you could say anything you want , - what would you say ? - Skye . Would you say he 's disgusting ? Would you tell him he 's a disgusting , backstabbing traitor ? - Or to rot in hell ? - What are you doing ? I 'm just trying to have an honest conversation for once . They 're starting to clear people out . We should go . No , I think I 'm good here . - Skye , we 've been made . Come on . - No . I tipped them off . Hail Hydra . You two , show me your hands ! Now ! Get hem off ! Out of the booth , nice and slow . All right , turn around . - Hands on your head . - Just be careful . He 's armed . Skye ! Officers , I surrender ! Arrest me ! Slow down , ma 'am . What are you talking about ? No , no . I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. , a wanted fugitive . Take me in . Come on ! What are you doing ? ! Get me out of here ! That 's it ! Come on . - I 'll do whatever you ... - Skye ! Skye , don 't run . You don 't understand ! I 'm not trying to hurt you ! You should be thanking me . I saved your ass . You didn 't save my ass . You turned it into a public spectacle . You let her get one over on you . That 's exactly what Garrett was afraid of . - And Garrett told you to stay out of sight . - He ordered me to shadow you . He knew you had a soft spot for Skye and she might take advantage of it . Well , he was wrong . We have her . And once she gives us a location , we 'll be off . Yeah , that 's not gonna happen . Take a walk . I can handle this . Can you ? You haven 't so far . Garrett says you have 5 minutes . I can explain . Lying bastard ! Son of a bitch ! You lying ... Stop . Stop . Stop ! Calm down . Okay ? Okay ? It 's over . You can 't win . Okay ? Stop . All this time , everything we 've been through ... why ? - How could you ? - I was on a mission . - It wasn 't personal . - " It was ... " you did not just say that . - " It wasn 't personal " ? ! - Skye , listen to me . God , I might actually believe that . You ... that I ... that is the twisted logic that they teach you when you sign up to be a Nazi . - Stop . Wait . I 'm not a Nazi . - Yes , you are . That is exactly what you are . It 's in the S.H.I.E.L.D. handbook , chapter one . The Red Skull , founder of Hydra , was a big , fat , freaking Nazi . That has nothing to do with today . You know , you always had that Hitler youth look to you . So it 's really not that surprising . It 's not like that . I 'm a spy . I had a job . You 've killed I don 't know how many people . - You gonna kill me now ? - No . I would never hurt you . Once I crack the drive , are you just gonna shoot me like you did with Thomas Nash , or are you gonna have someone else do it , like you did with Quinn ? I didn 't know that was gonna happen . That was all Garrett . Oh , of course it was Garrett 's fault . That was part of " the mission , " right ? Just gonna kick back and watch me bleed until it 's your turn to pull the trigger . You think I had a part in that ? That I would let that happen to you ? You know how I feel about you , Skye . Wait . So even though you 've been lying to everyone about everything , you 're saying that your feelings for me ... They 're real , Skye . They always have been . I 'm gonna throw up . Do you ... do you think this has been easy for me ? Do you have any idea how hard it was ? The sacrifices , the decisions I had to make ? But I made them . Because that 's what I do . - I 'm a survivor . - You are a serial killer . And you know what ? You were right about one thing . I wouldn 't like the real you . Someday ... Someday , you 'll understand . No . I won 't . And I will never ... ever ... give you what you want . Ow . Time 's up . You can tell me where to unlock the drive , or you can tell him . Mike ... Please . I know you don 't want to do this . It 's not up to me . Yes , it is . I don 't care what they did to you . You 're still Mike Peterson . You 're still a father . - You have a son . - Who I left in your hands . I asked you to look after him , Skye . Where is he now ? He 's with his aunt , under the protection of a S.H.I.E.L.D. team . And what is S.H.I.E.L.D. today ? Hydra can hurt my son anytime they want , and if I get any funny ideas about rescuing him , they push a little button and blow a hole in my skull . - Fitz-Simmons will figure out a way ... - No . There 's no way out of this , Skye . Tell us ... how to unlock ... the drive . - No . - Damn it , Skye ... You could have shot me back in Italy , but you didn 't . They made Quinn do it because there 's still good in you , Mike , and I don 't think you 're gonna hurt me . You 're right . I won 't hurt you . What ... what ... what did you do to him ? - Stopped his heart . - His heart ... Isn 't beating . He 's having a heart attack . I can restart it or not . - It 's your choice . - Skye ... You think I don 't want to watch him suffer ? Not suffer ... die . Garrett doesn 't think you 're gonna let that happen . - He 's a murderer . - Yes , he is . Are you ? - Okay , stop . - Where do you unlock the drive ? - Bring him back ! - Where ? 35,000 feet . It 's not based on longitude and latitude . - It 's altitude . - You 're lying . I 'm not ! You ... I put the password in and I ... I start the hack . And once we reach altitude , it unlocks . Now bring him back ! Put the password in . Start the hack . No tricks . You ... you son of a bitch . - Now get the plane in the air . - I can 't . I can barely stand . That should help . Maria Hill to S.H.I.E.L.D. 6-1-6 . You have 30 seconds to stand down and surrender . I repeat , stand down and surrender . You gonna answer me , Ward , or do I have to come over there ? Maria Hill . I kind of hoped you went down with the Triskelion . And I hoped you weren 't the duplicitous lowlife you turned out to be , but ... here we are . Gonna be honest with you , Hill . I 'm having a pretty bad day . So if I were you , I 'd get the hell out of my way . - Mm , give up Skye , and we 'll talk about it . - Yeah , that 's not happening . You know , I never liked you , Ward , not since our first sit-down , but I never figured you for John Garrett 's lapdog . A lot of us lost respect for Fury when he picked you as his second . If he needed eye candy around , he could have at least picked Romanoff . That 's funny . I 'll tell her you said that . Now hand Skye over , or I 'll have a squad of F-16s knock you on your ass . Even if you had that kind of pull anymore , which you don 't , Coulson would never let you do it . He would never sacrifice Skye like that . But you know Garrett would . So don 't try and follow us . This doesn 't have to go down like this , Ward . - You don 't owe Garrett anything . - You 're wrong . You want me to pursue ? No . Their tracking systems are up and running . Just hope we bought enough time . Are you okay ? Did Ward hurt you ? No , I 'm okay . But the encrypted hard drive ... I unlocked it for them . Forget that . We need to move . We got to take the cockpit . Wait . You came alone ? It 's okay . I can take Ward . No , I know , but how did you get past Deathlok ? Deathlok 's here ? On the plane ? Yeah , you didn 't take him out ? - New plan ... run ! - W-what about you ? Get to the cargo hold ... now . I can 't let you leave , Agent Coulson . It 's still my plane . I don 't need your permission . - I 've never used a parachute before ! - Forget that ! Get in the car ! Down ! Get down ! Buckle up ! I told you to buckle up ! All right ! He must have hit the thrusters ! That 'll be 20 bucks . I 'm putting the plane down . We need to go after them . No , we don 't . We stay with the plan . - I don 't answer to you . - Coulson and Skye don 't matter anymore . We have the data and Garrett wants us back right now . I 'm not just gonna forget what you did to me back there . You try anything like that again , I will kill you . Wasn 't personal . I was just following orders . - Wow . I can 't believe he shot Lola . - I can 't talk about it . Don 't blame you for going after him . We 'll need a base of operations , weapons , tactical backup . Who do you have working for you ? Okay , wait , wait . Hold on , Coulson . There is no more backup . No more hidden bunkers . Oh , come on . I know Fury has others . There 's no Fury . We 're not bringing the band back together again , Coulson . It 's over . There is no S.H.I.E.L.D. anymore . - Well ... not officially . - Look , I get it , okay ? You have to take Ward and Garrett down . But don 't act like it 's some officially sanctioned mission . It 's a personal vendetta , and when it 's done , you should walk . Let your people go their separate ways . And what ? Turn themselves in ? Cut a deal ? Work in the private sector ? You know Stark would take you in a heartbeat . It 's not my style . I should go . You know where to find me . Say hello to Stark for ... Oh , yeah . Never mind . He thinks I 'm dead . Must be some reason why Ward did it . Maybe they brainwashed him . Don 't know . Some people are just evil . I 'd rather not believe that . It 's true . I just assumed we 'd be better at spotting it . Tell me that you 're not Hydra . - What ? - I know that it 's ridiculous , but I just need to hear you say it . I 'm not Hydra . Yeah , good . Good . And I ... 'cause I 'm not , either . - Of course not . - Yeah . Because if ... if you ever did ... - I wouldn 't . - ... I don 't know what I would do . You 'll never have to find out . Thought you didn 't eat junk food . - I 'm on vacation . - Until ... ? Until that man tells me it 's time to work . Not tonight . Live a little . That case , I 'm gonna go crazy . Maybe have another bag . Never been homeless before . It 's not fun . At least we have a pool . - How you 're going on here ? - Sure . - We 'll get him . - I know . I left them a little present when I decrypted the drive . Should help . Thanks . Nice night . We 'll return in a moment . I was hoping you 'd come back . - Ward is ... - I know . Hill told me . There 's something you need to see . You wanted to know who was behind T.A.H.I.T.I. ? This is what I found out . Good morning , Director Fury . I regret to inform you that I 'm handing in my resignation . I know you brought me on to project T.A.H.I.T.I. because you trusted my judgment , and it 's that judgment that 's telling me I can no longer , in good conscience , let the testing continue . I understand you started the program to potentially save a mortally wounded Avenger , but the side effects are too extreme . We had initial success with the regenerative properties of the guest-host tissue , but after the initial physical recovery , the subjects began to deteriorate mentally , displaying hypergraphia , aphasia , catatonia , or just complete psychosis . We don 't know if it was the biology at play or simply the awareness of what was done , but the only course of action that showed any promise of stemming these side effects was memory replacement ... erasing completely the awareness of what they 'd been through . And even those results were very inconsistent . To be clear , I 'm recommending the termination of project T.A.H.I.T.I. Under no circumstances should these procedures or drugs be administered to anyone ever . The cost is far too great . Thank you , sir . Huh . Re-sync by wilson0804 Corrections by f1

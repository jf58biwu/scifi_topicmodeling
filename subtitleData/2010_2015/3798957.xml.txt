It 's just how many times do you get to shoot a giraffe ? Hey . Anyway , the zoo demoted me to the souvenir shop after that . Can you imagine ? You 're joking , right ? You shot an animal in captivity ? Just further proving that my philosophy is correct . Hunting 's not fair . So there 's no point pretending otherwise . What 's that ? This is what guarantees you a shot at the big game . Big game is what you 're after , right , Brett ? Nothing like shooting and eating an animal you 're not supposed to . Stop the boat . Uh , I usually don 't take orders , but I 'll let that one slide . What 'd you see , college boy ? A turtle ? Shh . Quiet . Okay , that one I 'm not gonna let slide . That 's gonna cost you an extra 20 . What did you see ? Did you see Vica get bitten ? No . Then whose blood is this ? Teddy 's . He went too close to the water , and I tried calling him , and he wouldn 't listen . Mom ? Yeah . I fed them . What ? The meat from our freezer . That 's why I stole from the store , because I couldn 't feed them enough . That 's why they ate Vica 's dog . Connor . You 've been coming here when we told you not to ? On my bike . You knew there were dangerous animals in the Lake and you didn 't tell us ? You would have made dad kill them . Oh , my God . No , no , sweetie . He would have ... He would never have done that . He would have moved them and taken them someplace safe . She gonna be okay ? I don 't know , sweetie . I ... Try the phone again please . Okay . Okay , uh , Connor , we have to get Vica into the car and get her to the hospital , okay ? Yeah , but what if they come back ? Doesn 't all this take some of the fun out of it ? You know what ? You 're right . Think that actually we should track their footprints and sniff the ground to see where they mark their territory . All right , guys , close enough . We 'll let your predator instincts take over from here , okay ? Yep . All right . This is the fun part . Oh ! Walt ! Walt ! Walt ! No ! No ! No , get off of me . Hurry up . Look , it 's a crocodile . Come on . Get her here . Get off of me ! Get off of me ! No , don 't be an idiot ! Get off ! Damn it ! That ain 't right . That ain 't anything close to right . We need to get the hell out of here . Yeah , to where ? Hey , you 're the guide . You tell me . No . No . We can 't just leave Walt . Oh , of course we can . Something just ripped him to pieces back there . But I know . Let 's all get back in the water . You grab an arm , you grab a leg , and I 'll just bring up the rear . Shut up . Shut up ? Shut up ? Just calm down . Shut up ? Come on . You shut up . Hey ! Aah ! Someone needs to check her for ticks . Okay , Charlie . Enough 's enough . This isn 't funny anymore . Get your ass back here . God , which direction did he go ? Knowing Charlie , he 's probably finding a quiet spot to whack off . Oh , why did we have to bring him ? It gives me the creeps . Shouldn 't have brought either of them . Would have given us a chance to be alone and get to know each other better . So that 's what this is about , huh ? I thought it was pretty obvious . You know , the first time I met you ... Well , uh , you had me after hello . Look , let 's find Charlie first , okay ? Then we can talk about what other movie lines you know . First you said you didn 't like it out here . And then it was too cold . Now you want to waste your time looking for Charlie goofball . You certainly bitch and moan a lot . You know , I thought you 'd be grateful I asked you along considering the alternative . You guys ? Charlie ? Is that you ? Mail-order piece of crap . Doesn 't work . Here . This is for you . This has got explosive shells in it . And this , this is a shark stick . Works like a shotgun , but underwater . One shot from this , it 'll take the head right off a great white . You 're not a tranquilizer dart sort of guy , are you ? Damn straight . If we run into this mythical crocodile of yours , let 's get one thing straight . I don 't want any of your epa endangered species crap . Are we on the same page ? Yeah . God , Charlie . If you want to be a peeping Tom , I 'll save you the trouble . What the- - ? It 's another one of those deer things . Ellie . Aaron . What was that ? Shh , shh , shh . Where 'd it come from ? Not even sure I heard it . Aah ! Ellie ! So what do you think did this ?

He 's friends with this guy I know . I came out here to find my girlfriend , to stop her from doing something stupid . Yeah , well , it seems like coming out here was already pretty stupid . Sorry about your friend . Oh , I hated him . He 's an idiot . And a pervert . Yeah ? Then I 'm sorry he smells so bad . So what we do now ? In your case , I 'd finish High School .

Now , before we all got unceremoniously jacked from my boat , we were following a tracking signal from an elk . Now , that elk , it seems , is actually passing through the digestive tract of our gator . I 'm sorry to put it this way , but predators go to where their food is , so whatever killed smelly over there knows where your girlfriend is . Now all we have to do is follow him . Come on , baby . Come on . Talk to mama . Yes . Nothing bigger than a trout ? Hmm . I 'd say that thing 's a little bigger than a damn trout ! It was just a job for you . But everyone I have left is in this room , and they 're in danger because I trusted you . It 's got to be 25 feet long ! I screwed up . Is that what you want to hear ? I 'm sorry . The big one , I have no idea . It could have been dropped from the sky . Yeah , dropped from ... The--the elk . Three years ago , the EPA reintroduced elk just down the River . Predators move towards their food . It is possible that they didn 't show up on your sonar because it wasn 't in the Lake . Question is why 'd they come back here ? I don 't ... I mean , did the big one follow the elk into the area ? I don 't know . It 's an answer for the big one , but the smaller ones , they 've been here for months . Talk to your son . Uh , hey , I 'm , uh ... I 'm gonna go check and see what kind of shampoo you use . You knew about that ? Come here . Come here . Is this where you 've been going on your bike every day ? You know , they almost killed Vica . You know they can kill you . Never hurt me . Listen . They 're not your friends . They 're wild animals , and wild animals live by a set of rules to ensure their survival . One of the rules is that they eat anything smaller than they are . Do you understand that ? They 're not your friends . It was just something cool to play with . Both of you left me alone . You care more about your stupid elk than me , and mom 's always working .

I think he 's looking for me ! You can 't be serious . You think Brett gives a rat 's ass about you ? You think he cares enough about you to get his shoes dirty ? If that were true , you wouldn 't be here with me in the first place . He 's cheating on you , Ellie , and everybody at school knows it but you . No , no . Maybe he- - he heard the gunshots , or maybe- - maybe he fired them . Why do you put him on such a pedestal ? He doesn 't give a rat 's ass about you . He told me so himself . He 's not out looking for you . He 's back at school probably in some freshman 's dorm room right now . We got a camp a few miles away from here . We find the camp and we can find our way home . No . No , no . We 've been turned around for an hour now . The only way we know is towards the gunshots . Make your choice . Let someone who really cares about you save you , or you can go crying to Brett . Like usual . No . Please don 't leave me . You go in that direction , and you 're walking alone . Please come with me . Aaron ! Aaron . This is actually the most fun I 've had in quite a while . Mm-hmm . Some fun . Can 't tell if I 'm excited , or if I 'm gonna throw up in my mouth from the terror . Just in case it 's the latter . All right . We don 't even know what the hell this thing is yet , and I 'm already picking out a spot on my wall for its head . You know what ? Maybe it 's mutated and has two heads . If that happens to be the case , I get ' em both . If there 's three heads , you can have one . Guys , I can hear you . My girlfriend ? If he wants one of the heads , I 'm not giving him one of mine . Can 't have mine , neither . I didn 't come out here to fight wild animals . Hey , hey , you know what ? Look , we can 't find your girlfriend if we 're all gator crap . Last chance , Brett . You gonna tell us why you 're stalking your own girlfriend ? Oh , wait a minute . If this is about a restraining order , there are ways around that . Believe me . I know . She 's being lied to . About me . There 's this guy , Aaron . He 's a grad student . He was tutoring her for a while . He told her there was another girl , and he used that opportunity to get between us . And now he takes her with him on this trip , and you can only guess what he 's hoping to do with her . I love it out here . Hmm . Where 's Dr. Phil when you need him ? Who 's Dr. Phil ? It 's not her . Oh , my God . It 's Tara . Brett , get back . It 's her best friend . She must be close . We got to find her . Ellie ! Can you hear me ? Shut up ! Well , that 's one way to bring ' em closer . Can you hear me ? Shut up . Jonas , you ready for this ? Try not to mess up its head . Heads . Ellie ! Whoo-hoo ! Oh , man . That 's got to be the hottest thing I ever seen . Aah ! He 's awake . Get Connor ready to run . Aah ! Need a bigger gun . Definitely need a bigger gun . Wait ! Stop ! Aah ! What was I thinking ? Give me that . I 'm afraid that I have to ban you from ever participating in one of my hunting expeditions ever again . Something in the contract about not blowing holes in the guide . Yeah , no complaints from me . That bastard ruined my pants . And he stole my knife . Well , you stabbed him in the face . Yeah , I know . And I would have carved my name in his hide had it not got stuck in his head . As for your belly aching ... Ugh . It 's not the first time I 've been shot by someone I know . Ugh ! God . It is the first time I 've been hit . I 'm afraid I 'm not gonna be able to walk out of here . The boat . The boat . Yeah . Getting in the water sounds like a fine idea to me , college boy . Well , unless you can think of another way . Actually , no , I can 't . No way to keep our orientation with the sun going down . When we get in the boat , where do we go ? Only one place to go . There 's a cabin on the other side of the Lake . I 'm having a bit of a misunderstanding with the owner , so if anybody 's there when we get there , just keep the elk poaching on the down-low . Ugh . I 'm the one with the injured leg , Rambo , okay ? Let 's go . What about Ellie ? We can 't go looking for her now . We wouldn 't know where to look . You think she 's dead , don 't you ? I didn 't say that . Look , I can 't know for sure , but we wouldn 't do her any good if we get ourselves killed , would we ? Those were crocodiles . I 've read enough about crocodiles to know that they don 't stop killing food just because they 're full . They also don 't travel very far if they don 't have to . She 's nearby . Whatever you do , do not start screaming like you did the last time . She 's my girlfriend ! If you had any kind of normal relationships , you 'd understand . Jonas and I chase after a killer crocodile for you , practically playing 20 questions trying to figure out what would drive you to follow Ellie in here to begin with , and , may I point out , that we didn 't even know the damsel 's name until you start screaming it at the top of your lungs , attracting that monster that came out of the Woods and bit off Jonas ' head . And how the hell do you know I don 't have any normal relationships , huh ? I know all about you . All about your boo-hooing about miss Ellie . But you ask me one question ? One question about me and my life ? Okay . Do you have a boyfriend ? No . No , I don 't have a boyfriend , dumbass ! That was hypothetical . Now that you know all about me , let 's get in the boat and go someplace safe . No , I won 't . Really ? Not without Ellie . Yeah ? Ugh . Fine . We 'll see how you like being dragged . Johnny law . Nathan , actually . I would have introduced myself last time , but when I asked for your hunter 's license , you spit tobacco juice on my shoes . Yeah ? I 'm a shy girl . You know , you got a bit of an infestation of a very unusual variety out there . Yeah , looks like they got you pretty bad . There were four of us . And the other two ... Didn 't fare ... As--as well . But the crocs didn 't shoot me . That one did . I already said I was sorry . Thanks for taking us in , but we need to get back out there . I 'm Brett , by the way . Uh , Nathan . Hey . Uh , Susan . This is Connor . Why would you want to go back outside ? Are you crazy ? Because my girlfriend 's out there on the Lake . We were looking for her when Reba decided to come here instead . It 's better off behind a closed door than running around in the dark . Exactly why we need to get back on the boat and find Ellie . Well , we 've been trapped in here for hours , and there 's the very real possibility that help isn 't coming . And we can 't let you take our only means of transportation and go and get yourself killed . Especially when that only means of transportation belongs to me . We get back in the boat , we find Ellie , and then we get the hell away from here . Ellie 's on the Lake . Now we need to get to safety . That 's connecting to the River and going down to town . Those are opposite directions . No , this isn 't up for debate . We 're not leaving her . You don 't even know where she is . Now , my wife and my son are right here , and I can 't risk their lives based upon the chance or the possibility that she might be out there . Sensible conversation didn 't get me very far with her . I 'm sorry to have to do this . I already shot someone today . I don 't mind doing it again . Get away from the door . Now 's a fine time to grow yourself a pair . I will come back for you . I promise . Just as soon as I find her . Ah . Ellie ! Ellie ! Brett ? Ellie ! Ellie ! Brett ! Ellie ! Brett ! Back sooner than I thought . Brett . Brett ! I 'm coming back ! Brett , I 'm here ! Ellie ! I 'm here , baby . I 'm here . I knew . Brett ! Connor , get to the bathroom and lock the door ! Go ! Aah ! Brett ! No . No . Oh , my God , Brett . I knew . I knew . Get away from the water ! What ? Get away from the water ! Get away from the water ! Ellie ! Oh , my God ! What is that ? I 'm so sorry . Hey , hey , no . You don 't need to apologize . For going with him . With Aaron . Shh . No , you don 't have to apologize . I love you . I love you . I love you . Ellie , go . Go . Now . Go . Run . Now . Aah ! What is--what is that ? Oh , my God ! Aah ! Nicely done . Let 's get the hell out of here . Now . Ugh . Ow ! Ah . It 's okay . I can always come back for the head later . Connor , stay close . Oh . Hey , hey , hey . Hey , hey , hey . What happened ? It killed--it killed him . Who ? Who ? Brett . Nathan , the boat ! Now ! Right . Go , go , go . Connor , come . You okay ? Keep trying . Okay . Plan B. Ugh ! Ugh ! Aah ! Here we go . Yeah . I think we 're safe . What is that ? Go . Go . Go . Come on . Go . Connor ? Hello ? Hello ? Come on ! Over there . What makes you think Dimitri 's not gonna have locked his doors ? Ugh ! What now ? Aah ! After you . Okay , let 's put her down . I 'll call for help . All right . Does anybody have a quarter ? No . No . It 's 911 . You don 't need any money . Okay . No , no , no , no , no , no , no . No . It 's gonna be okay . We 're gonna get out of here . What about Connor and ... This is all my fault . I should have been there for him . This is my fault . Oh , it 's you . Little Bickerman . Don 't you- - oh , my God ! Run ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Run ! Go ! Go ! Aah ! Help ! Aah ! Help me ! Aah ! Connor , Susan , back door 's open ! Go ! No keys . Don 't you know how to hotwire ? I 'm a zoologist . Connor ! Connor ? Keys . This is the one and only time you 're allowed to steal something . Connor . Are we 07 or 08 ? 07 ! Connor ! Dad , lighter ! Nathan ! No , dad ! I 'd like to present you today an absolutely extraordinary case , and proof that we are not in control . We are not in control of our jobs . We are not in control of our children . And we are certainly not in control of this planet . There are no hard and fast rules in nature . There 's no way to create a system by which we can catalog and analyze and predict where an animal is gonna go , or what an animal is gonna do . Having said all that , I would like to now regale you with a story of a most unique species- - the Maine River Crocodile . For the record , it 's extinct . Come along . So , uh , did you guys have time to read the pamphlets ? Anyone ?

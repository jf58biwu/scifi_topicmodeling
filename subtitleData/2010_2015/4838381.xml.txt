 [ crashing sounds ] [ whoosh ] [ whistling ] [ crashing sound ] [ splintering sounds ] [ street sounds ] [ subway sounds ] ( male voice over dispatch radio ) Roger , copy . [ soft chatter ] ( Jason ) Good morning , ladies and gents . ( employee ) Hey , Jason . I need a motorman 's report on Lexington 1 26 . Good morning , George . And slow Broadway 91 2 to three quarters , please . ( Pete ) Broadway 91 2 , can you slow to three quarters ? Good morning , Pete . Jason . For Emily . A hundred and sixty gigabytes ? Hell , yes . This shit will give her bragging rights . That 's , like , 1 0,000 songs , man . She 's 1 2 years old . Dude , it 's the best they 've got . I know what the 1 8 year old girls are into . Twelve , not really my area of expertise . Yeah , I bet you do know what the 1 8 year old girls are into . Living the dream , baby . God bless you . Your boy on Columbus 245 is running behind again . Columbus 245 , can you speed up three quarters ? [ train shrieking ] [ explosion ] [ whooshing ] [ roaring ] [ dull loud noise ] ( employee No. 2 ) Did we lose power ? Somebody check the phone line . [ humming gets louder ] What the hell was that ? ( Pete ) Jesus Christ ! [ alarm continues ] We 've got a disruption at Noble street . Was that a bomb ? ! Jimmy ? ( Jimmy ) Head for the exits . Come on . Watch your step . Don 't panic . Exit at the end of the platforms . ( Jason ) Yo ! Jimmy . Jimmy , it 's Jason . I need eyes down on Noble Street . You on it ? Jimmy , you copy ? [ static ] Come on , out . Go ! [ female voice over speakers , indistinct ] ( Jason ) Come on , man . Where the hell are you ? ... all passengers ... Yeah , I 'm here . What the hell 's going on down there ? ( Jimmy ) Hold your horses . I 'm on my way . Well , it looks like we got penetration through the sidewalk into the Noble Street tunnel . Was it a bomb ? Negative . Not a bogie . I 'll get eyeballs on it , get back to you . If you haven 't got eyeballs on it , how do you know that it 's not a bomb ? Hey , man , after three tours in Iraq , I know what a bomb sounds like . Jesus , man , just get me the information , will you ? Screw this . I 'll call Homeland Security . Yo . We got Broadway 91 2 getting there in about two minutes . Switch it to the A line- - [ shout ] You get Caz on the line . Hey . ( Caz ) Caz speaking . You guys feel that ? What , you mean the entire building shaking ? Yeah . Space debris . What ? It 's all over the news . I knew it would happen . They keep sending stuff into space , but when it gets outdated no one wants to spend the money to take it down . ( reporter ) Apparently the satellite is of Russian origin . Scientists expected that it would disintegrate as it hit the Earth 's atmosphere , and any unburned- - Just when I thought I 'd seen every possible way to screw up the Monday commute . They said they had the thing tracked as it entered the atmosphere . Came off of a satellite launched in the 80s . Nice of them to tell us about it . I 'm going down there . We gotta get that line open by rush hour . Yeah , okay . See you there . Jimmy they 're telling me that it 's a piece of satellite . [ static ] Jimmy ? [ static ] Do you read me ? [ panting ] [ groaning ] Don 't leave me hanging , man . [ grunt ] [ crackling ] [ static ] Jimmy ? Have you talked to Jimmy ? Negative . I 'm going down there . Keep trying him . If you get him , hit me . You got it . [ street sounds ] [ siren wailing ] [ female reporter reporting in distance ] Of course we will bring you the very latest on this developing story , as we learn it but for now , let 's go out live to John Smith who is near the crash site . John , what are you seeing on the ground ? What have we got , a jumper ? I 'm sorry . It 's Jimmy . What ? He hit the third rail . No , no . No way . He must 've gotten disoriented in the dust . There 's really no other explanation . Sorry , man . That doesn 't make any sense . Jimmy 's got way too much experience for that . ( Caz , on walkie ) Jason , did you see him ? What , are you talking about Jimmy ? They 're calling it electrocution . No , it doesn 't add up . Yeah , I know . I 'm with you . Are you coming down ? I 've got a half dozen suits flying around here . I got it . I 'm sorry. I know you guys were close . I gotta go . [ machine crackling ] ( male voice No. 1 ) No , I 'm not getting anything . ( male voice No. 2 ) Yeah , me neither . I 'm all clear in this area . Come in , guys . It 's all clear . ( Jenkins ) We 're clear of radioactivity . They found a chunk of metal , they 're bringing it to us now . ( Jason ) That 's it ? You had a man down here right after it hit ? Yeah . Why ? Died of electric shock ? Dr. Darnoff , you recognize this ? Mean anything to you ? Piece of the waste disposal module , on the opposite side of the craft . Useless . Alright . Looks like we 're clear . Civil , over to you . We 're going back up . Doctor , come with me . So when can we open the station ? FEMA has no problem with it . Homeland Security is satisfied . ( Rachel ) New York City Department of Health isn 't satisfied . The emotional health of a hell of a lot of commuters is going to take a nose dive if we don 't reopen by rush hour . I 'm sorry . You have waste disposal issues here . They just said that there 's nothing down here . Department procedure . What do you want me to do ? You want me to dust the subway tunnel ? I have a job to do , Jason . Yeah , I do , too . You sure this is the Health Department speaking ? Yes , it is . I don 't have time for this . ( Caz ) Guys ! You have people here . I 'll supervise the crew myself . We 'll do our best to get it knocked out before rush hour . Are we good ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . [ squeaking ] So , whose agency is picking up the tab for the clean up and repair ? [ wild squeak ] lt was decommissioned in the 1 980s . So what , Russian ? ( male voice No. 3 ) Soviet Union . It was a different country back then . Yep. lt 's coming out of my budget . [ siren wailing ] [ phone beeping ] Hey . ( Peter over phone ) Yeah , what 's up ? I 'm leaving Noble Street . I 've gotta take care of something . Copy that . Anything goes on down there , I want you to call me . You 've got it . [ beep ] Uh , Pete ? I 've gotta bounce . Okay . [ lively chatter ] So then he texted , sure . Really ? That 's odd . He 's an older guy . Eighth grade . Guys ? Eighth grade ? Happy birthday , sweetie . Hi . Okay , I really have to go . Bye . Sorry I 'm late . It 's okay . Thanks for covering . I 'm used to it . Thanks . Good luck tonight . Did you guys hear the news about Dad 's subway ? Uh , yeah . It 's weird . I got all the presents , and I 've gotta rush . Okay . Bye . Did Dad call ? He sent me a text . He 's not gonna make it . You know your dad means well . You know he 's trying , right ? He always tries , but he never does . What if I just opened one ? Before dinner ? Well ? [ sucks in air ] Okay . Just take a seat . Excuse me . You with Transit Authority ? Yeah . Hi . Jason . Jason Cole . Doctor Stella . This way . The EMT said he died ... from contact with the third rail . What 's your professional opinion on that ? Technically , yes . What do you mean by technically ? Well , five years in the ER I 've seen every kind of gross there is , but this- - is that Jimmy ? I 'm sorry . [ panting ] Why is he opened up like that ? And what are those , what 's that crap inside of his body ? Insect eggs . Insect eggs ? Some insects , such as spiders , plant their eggs in a foreign host . And he had a bite to his lower left shin . We removed these from his abdomen . You mind if I take these to City Health ? Be my guest . It saves me the paperwork . Thanks , Doc . [ female reporter , indistinct ] Authorities have determined that the death of an NYT subway worker- - [ continues indistinct ] ( Jason ) I called him . Instead of shutting down the line , I got shut down instead . You gotta do it , Caz . There 's something going on down there . Yeah , I 'm gonna take the heat . Alright , I 'll see you in about a half hour . [ upbeat music playing ] Who is it ? ( Jason ) lt 's me , Rach . I know . I know I 'm late . Okay . How 's my almost teenager ? [ door closes ] You missed it . I 'm sorry , honey . It 's okay . No , it 's not okay . Your old man had a crazy day today . Otherwise I never would have missed your birthday . It broke my heart . But ... I got something for you . That 's a hundred and sixty gigabytes . [ chuckles ] Epic . Thank you . I 'm gonna go download some music . She only turns 1 2 once . I had a few problems down at the ranch , in case you didn 't notice . It 's New York City . There 's always a crisis . No , it 's bigger than that , Rach . Bigger than your daughter 's birthday ? I went and saw Jimmy 's body down at the morgue . He wasn 't just killed from electricity . What ? Something bit his leg , and left these eggs inside of his body . Can you check them out for me , give me an analysis ? Of course . Whatever bit him is stillm down there . Jesus , Jason . Yeah , I know . I gotta go back . I gotta close the station . Em ? Come give your old man a kiss . Daddy , but it 's my birthday . Yeah , I know . But I 'm gonna make it up to you . We 're gonna have movie night this week . Candy ? Yeah . At least 20 dollars in candy . is that a deal ? Deal . Yeah ? Cool . Yeah . Okay , Dad . I 'm gonna go finish the download . Hey , wait . The divorce settlement from my lawyer . Oh , I guess it 's final now , huh ? I guess so . Okay . [ shrieks ] [ shrieking ] [ shrieking continues ] [ rats squeaking ] Yeah , but things are gonna get so bad . I 've shut down the station . That 's right . Yeah , see you later . What the hell 's going on ? This is what happens when the guy who runs pest control is the mayor 's cousin . They 're on their way . [ shrieking ] Your wife still got that cat ? ( female voice on speaker ) Noble Street Station is now closed . Please proceed to the nearest exit . [ rats squeaking ] Thank you for using the New York City Transit . Hey , you guys call the exterminator ? Yeah . We got a little job for you . Check this out . Trouble seems to be coming from down here . ( Caz ) Jimmy. I can 't believe it . ( Jason ) I know I 'm gonna miss seeing his face down here . Oh , his wife . Patty 's a mess . You damn rats . Whatever it was , we 're gonna find it and get it out of here . Oh . Oh , Jesus . Ugh . People live here . At least it 's warm and it 's dry . It 's smelly . Oh , Caz . ( Caz ) New York Transit Police ! Huh ? Poor bastards . Hey , buddy ! Jesus . That 's it . That 's what got Jimmy . It 's down here , Caz . Oh . Oh , Jesus . Look at this . Here 's another one . Yo ! What ? It 's spiders . I just saw it . You guys , get in here ! [ spider squeaking ] Where 'd it go ? Where 'd it go ? ( exterminator ) Where ? It 's right down here . Look at this ! Oh no ! Caz ! No , get off ! Caz ! Get off ! [ shouting ] Caz , no ! [ scream ] Get the thing going ! What 's wrong with you ? It won 't start ! Come on ! Get them off ! Get them off ! Get it on him ! Come on ! Do it ! [ screams ] Caz ! He 's gone , man . Come on . ( Jason ) Oh my God . Oh my God . We 're now dealing with a code red health alert at this hour . US Military officials have erected a quarantine zone . Here 's what you need to know . The areas affected are Broadway , Bowery , East Houston and Eighth Street , all shut down . All traffic is being rerouted . ( man from helicopter ) You are in a military evacuation zone . Please leave the area immediately . This is bullshit . Adam put in an extra shot of espresso . You 're gonna need it . Sorry about Caz . Yeah , thanks . I call this some primo shit storm . You got that right . What are we looking at ? We completely reset the routing , keep the trains running as far away from this mess as possible , which is no small feat . Good , good . We got an army of scientists and government security people doing some high tech stuff at Noble Street Station . By the way , they jammed the phone service in the area , no cell phones . I know , I 've been trying to call Emily . Yo . Nah , no thanks . No , there 's no virus . You sure ? This is about those spiders that killed Caz . I just got off the phone with Rachel . The eggs don 't have bacteria on them . We got a bunch of suits telling the media outlets there 's some sort of lethal virus outbreak . Yeah , well , they 'll do anything to hide it . It 's not my pay grade to think about these things . That 's for people like you . It 's a real shit storm . Yeah , and now they 've locked down Noble Street Station . Yeah , I guess you made the right call on those espressos . I 've got a shift about to go into triple overtime . I 'll see you back at the office . Thanks , Pete . ( M P 1 ) Hey man , you can 't be here . Hold it . I 'm Station Supervisor Jason Cole . Came to get my daughter . Jason Cole . [ beeping ] You 're clear to go . [ metallic sounds ] [ hissing ] [ spitting ] [ spider squealing ] That 's all . Darnoff , tell your people to get their masks back on . We need to keep this virus story locked down . They don 't believe in your fairy tales here , Colonel . Tell your people we have been vaccinated . You found what you 're looking for ? This is the first person to be bitten ? So I 'm told . Then someone must have taken it out . Taken what ? The queen egg . The queen is always implanted in the first host . These are male eggs . The queen will be a different shape and color . What color ? Pfft . Brown , maybe . Not this . This is Jenkins . Yeah , I need all the paperwork with the body that we just picked up from the morgue . You tell me as soon as you 've got it . Twenty years , two marriages I 've served this project , just to watch it crumble when the wall came down . And then it falls from the sky right into my lap . And you lose it . If we had the queen egg , none of this would be necessary . We wouldn 't have to work here in these tunnels , in less than ideal conditions . What 's wrong with the male eggs ? Why do we need a queen egg ? Why do we need the queen egg ? The queen is the only one that can produce the quality of webbing that your people require . Can you believe these creatures ? These are newborns , but already they work together . They have established their territory and now they build a nest for the queen . But if we don 't get the egg into their nest in twelve hours , she will die . So you and your people must find it , or our work here is useless . This is Jenkins . Give me Operations . [ sirens wailing ] Health Department Supervisor Rachel Coles has just logged a report on the eggs found in the subway worker 's body . Pull up her profile . It 's a match . Rachel Cole , recently divorced from Jason Cole , our NYT line supervisor that was at the hospital last night . Good work , gentlemen . We 're back on the trail . Let 's get this to Jenkins ASAP . There 's nothing here . If there was , you would have found it by now . ( guard 1 ) Get back here ! But I don 't feel sick ! ( Phoebe ) Hey ! ( Phoebe ) Hey , hey ! I want my dad . Stop it ! ( guard 1 ) You 'll stay for a few days . Watch her . Emily ! ( guard 2 ) Sir , stay away from the building . My daughter 's in there ! Sir . We need you to step away . You need to tell me what the hell is going on here . The people inside are infected . Nobody is infected . There is no virus . What 's your name ? Jason Cole . We 've got a Jason Cole down here . White male , mid thirties . Dad ! Daddy , come on ! Sweetheart ! Daddy , come here ! Everything is gonna be okay . Just hold on . Daddy 's coming to get you . Daddy , come on ! Hurry ! I 'm coming ! [ shrieking ] Dad ! Hey ! Yeah , that 's him . Pick him up . Yes , sir . Okay , sir . Please . Mr. Cole . All I want is my daughter . We need you to stay where you are . Stay where you are [ gun cocking ] and put your hands above your head . Alright . Alright . Up here , take him out . [ elevator dings ] Hey , I don 't know what the hell we 've got here , but our lab people confirmed it 's not ... well , they don 't know what the hell it is either . See , I 'm telling you , no bacteria in any of the eggs . Everything on Earth has bacteria on it . Hey , come on . Before you start jumping to conclusions about little green men and Area Fifty-One , get this to our lab uptown , pronto . Have them do a DNA breakdown . They 've quarantined the whole neighborhood . You have to tell them that no bacteria means there 's no virus . They have to know . Yeah , I 'm on that , okay ? I get this quarantine business is bullshit . But I 've got the Mayor 's office working with me on this , but they 're gonna need a report on that . So if you can get this to the lab , pronto , I 'd appreciate that . Can you do that ? Don 't I always ? Thank you . Hey , Sara ? Get me Doctor Smirnoff or whatever his name is . For Dr. Darnoff . Yeah , I 'll take that . Yeah , this is Colonel Jenkins . How can I help you ? Uh-huh . Well , thank you Mr. Poor . Yeah . We 'll be in touch . Nicky ? We need to clean the trail . All of it ? Uh-huh . Nicky- - [ squeaking ] ( male reporter ) Channel Seven 's Janet Singer is live on the corner of Second and Noble . Go ahead , Janet . ( Janet ) City officials said today that the virus has been contained . However there is still no word on how long the area will be quarantined . And this announcement prompted an outcry from local residents who are saying they are being deprived of their homes and places of business and they are demanding compensation from the city and federal government . ( Rachel on phone ) Hey Pete , it 's Rachel . ( Pete ) What 's up ? I 'm trying to reach Jason and Emily . He 's alright . They 're not picking up . He 's got a lot on his plate , you know , but he 'll always sort it . [ smack ] Hey , I 'm walking here , man . Pete , are you there ? Pete ? [ loud hip hop music from van ] Pete ! Hello ? What 's going on ? Nothing . People are nuts . Look , listen , just let me call you when I get back , alright ? What the- - ? [ loud honking ] [ engine starts ] [ loud hip hop music from van ] [ phone beeping in a call ] [ phone ringing at other end ] ( Emily 's recorded voice ) Hey , it 's Emily , you know what to do . [ beep ] ( Rachel ) Hey , Emily , honey , it 's Mom . Um , give me a call as soon as you can . It 's kind of important . [ gasping ] [ shrieking ] [ shouting ] [ screaming ] [ cell phone ringing ] [ crying ] J--Jason . Thank God . ( Jason ) What 's wrong ? Are you alright ? No . Yes . I am . But- - Rachel , just ... calm down and breathe . No ... there 's a man , he 's dead . What ? Two men tried to car jack me . There was nothing I could do . They took my purse with the eggs . The men . What 'd they look like ? What 's the difference what they looked like ? Rachel ? What did they look like ? Where are you right now ? I 'm , I 'm stuck in traffic . Get out . ( Rachel ) I can 't leave the car . Just do what I say . Get out , run away , leave the car . l--l can 't . Yes , you can . Do it , Rachel . You have to . [ cars honking ] ( taxi driver ) Hey , lady ! Good work . Alright , back to base . is that it ? This is the queen . I will get it to the nest immediately . Good . The Police are gonna want to question me. l- - Will you trust me , please ? Yeah . Where are you ? Where are you ? Couple blocks north of the office . Meet me at the bank . Okay. I 'm coming to you . I 'm a couple block ... blocks east . Just act casual , don 't draw any attention to yourself . What 's going on ? I 'll explain when I get there . Come on , Pete . [ cell phone ringing ] [ panting ] [ grunt ] ( Jason on phone ) Hello ? Pete , are you there ? [ grunting ] Can you hear me ? Pete ! Pete , what 's going on ? Talk to me , man . Pete ? [ spiders snarling ] ( Jenkins ) Jesus Christ , what the hell happened ? [ snarling ] ( Darnoff ) Six inches per hour . Six inches per hour . [ angry snarling ] lt 's growing so much faster here on Earth than it ever did in our space station . How big is the queen gonna get ? The genetic restrictions , seven , maybe eight feet . [ snarling ] I 'll have to thank you , for finding my egg . It is undamaged , and it has been accepted in the nest . Yes , no problem . So that 's what this is about ? Huge spiders ? Look like huge spiders , but that is just the form that they are inhabiting . Twenty years ago , we discovered a spacecraft deep under the ice in the Caucasus Mountains . Must have been there for a thousand years . What we found on that craft ... defies all explanation . We took its DNA , and we artificially fertilized in the zero gravity of space . We tried the gene splicing with many different creatures . but it was the spider ... that had the structure to enable it to survive in Earth gravity and atmosphere . So , what about the webbing ? Come . A queen spider will weave an infinite supply of lightweight , bulletproof , stealth material . Whatever nation controls this material will have military and industrial advantage light years beyond any other nation . Jenkins . Yeah. I don 't care how you lost him . You know , go to the apartment . You could pick him up there . You let me know when it 's done . You 're still holding these people ? You can let them go . Yeah , the security of this operation is my concern , doctor , not yours . But we have the queen egg . We have no reason . I suggest you keep your eyes on your precious spiders and your god damned nose out of my business . Do I make myself clear ? And I suggest , Colonel , that you do the right thing , and you let them go . [ chuckles ] [ sirens wailing ] [ chatter ] [ elevator dings ] [ ding ] Excuse me . ( man in suit ) Mm-hm . ( woman ) Hey , did you do the analysis on those weird eggs this morning ? Yeah . I washed my hands . [ silenced gunshot ] [ woman gasps ] ( Bill ) Yeah , but which department ? That 's not even my jurisdiction . No , you 're gonna have- - hold on a sec . Can I help you ? [ silenced gun shot ] ( Emily ) Let us out ! This is not fair . ( soldier ) Keep it down or I 'll arrest you . We 're already arrested . I want a lawyer ! Yeah , sure . I 'll get you one right away . [ jiggles doorknob ] [ Phoebe dialing ] Check the Internet . [ beeping ] Not working . Yeah , there 's no cell service , either . Oh , we 'll figure it out . Rach . Jason ! I 've been calling home and I can 't get through . They quarantined Emily and the apartment . They won 't let me get to her . [ sigh ] Rach ? Rach . We have to go find her . We 're going to . Emma . We 're gonna get her back . [ Police siren ] Move , move . They 're together . [ pinging ] I got both their cell numbers pinging off the same towers , about a block north . [ people whispering indistinct ] ( male voice ) We should call the cops . [ indistinct ] ( Jason ) lt 's a lie . It 's a lie . We 're fine . Government 's lying to you . Come on . We 're fine . Go ! [ tires screech ] [ honking ] is your cell phone on ? My battery died . Good , that 'll keep the GPS off . It 's my bat cap . And ? The signal is gone . And they were right here . Where ? They should be right here . Son of a bitch . ( Rachel ) Wait ! I know these tunnels , the quickest way to the apartment . Hey . This rail is live . Okay , okay . Okay . Shit . [ screams ] It 's just bats . This must be New York City , or a National Geographic special . Welcome to the subway . That way . It 'll get us closer to the apartment . ( Phoebe ) Here . You should eat . What are you doing ? I 've got an idea . Emily , where are you going ? Come on ! I used to play in here when I was younger , but that was a long time ago . You mean like when you were an infant ? Oh . Okay . Talk about Area 51 in Manhattan . They won 't be complaining about the rats any more . [ shouts ] ( Rachel ) Oh , oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! [ roars and squeals ] Come on . Come on . Okay , okay . Oh . No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . Come on . No . It 's dangerous . No , Emily ! Emily ! Come back ! There 's no stairs ! They 're out on the fire escape . What 's going on in there ? Come back ! Someone 's coming . Come on ! [ indistinct chatter ] [ clanking ] Holy crap . Let 's move out . ( Jenkins ) How 'd it happen ? How many ? Uh-huh . All right . Go to Code Red . As many service men as you need . Just for containment , but hold your fire . So , they 're getting out of the nest . Some are above ground . How 'd this happen ? What 's going on ? The spiders are smarter than your engineers . Now the queen has been born , they want to explore the limits of their territory . But they won 't go too far from the queen . So , you tell your soldiers on the street just to stay out of their way . All right . I 'm coming up . [ indistinct radio chatter ] [ hazard sirens ] Oh , shit . [ hissing ] What was that ? Come on , let 's keep moving this way . [ spider noises ] [ hissing ] [ screaming ] No ! No ! No ! Oh , no ! [ screaming ] Oh , my God ! Oh , my God ! Come on . [ screaming ] Oh , my God ! Are you okay ? Thanks , babe . You haven 't called me babe in months . Never seen the like before . [ glass breaking ] [ roaring and grunting ] [ loud grunting ] [ grunting ] This way . [ roaring ] [ shouts ] [ roars ] [ screams ] Jason ! [ spider grunting ] Jason . Jason ! Rach ! Jason ! Jason ! [ roars and grunts ] [ screams ] Rachel ! Right here . Come on . Come on . That 's it . Come on . [ grunting ] Come on ! Come on ! Jason , come back ! [ roars ] Jason ! [ grunting ] Hey , ugly ! [ grunting ] [ screeching ] Oh , that 's nasty . I 'm coming , babe ! [ screaming ] ( Rachel ) Let 's get out of here . Drive . Drive , baby ! Come on ! ( Rachel ) Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go ! Go , Jason ! [ screams ] Hang on ! [ Rachel screams ] [ spider screeches ] ( Rachel ) Go , go . Go . ( soldier ) They they are . [ machine-gun fire ] ( soldier ) Hold your fire ! [ machine-gun fire ] Hurry ! [ shouting ] ( Jason ) Go , go . ( soldier ) Freeze ! Stop where you are ! Go ! Freeze ! Stay right there ! Hey ! Hey , kid ! Get back here . [ glass breaks ] [ roars ] Get him off ! Get him off ! I 'm trying ! I 'm trying ! Get him off ! [ screaming ] What now ? Get past the giant spiders and heavily armed men that are trying to kill us . Get to the apartment , grab Emily , get her past the giant spiders and heavily armed men , and we 're home free . That 's not much of a plan . No , no , no . Rachel . Come on . Come , come on ! We 're gonna take the back stairs . Shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh , shh . [ helicopter flying by ] ( Darnoff ) Of course they were attacked . Your soldiers here pose a threat . They are only exploring their territory . Tell your men they must stay out of their way . My men can 't hold the boundary much longer . We gotta move . lmpossible . She is still dependent on the other spiders for food . She is not ready . I need her . She has got her timeline and I 've got mine . You go and do whatever you need to do to get her ready . We 're moving . Colonel , I want you to know you are making a mistake . A big mistake . Just get her in the goddamned box . ( soldier ) Stay together . Watch your step . Hey , why don 't CDC take care of these people ? Hey , I have a lot of other things I could be doing besides this . Keep it down , will you ? These things react to sound . You take the east . We 'll take the north south . Yes , sir . Copy that . There 's only one way out of here . What did you do to my daughter ? What 'd you do ? I don 't know , man . What did you do to my daughter ? I need my mask . I need my mask . Don 't , don 't make me , don 't make me use this . Look , man , I swear I didn 't wanna do it . Shh . I need my mask ! Keep your voice down . I didn 't wanna do it . You didn 't wanna what ? We just put her in quarantine . I swear , man . Get up . Look , man , I need my mask . There 's no damned virus . Your superiors lied to you to clear the streets . I don 't wanna use this , man , but you messed with my little girl . Look , I know it 's fucked up . But I had my orders . How could you ? She 's twelve . Yeah , she 's in the apartment . She 's okay . I swear . [ gun cocking ] Oh , please . Freeze ! Put the weapon down ! Put it down ! [ spitting ] This is ridiculous . Try another angle . Just get us back online . They 're covering up our inside cameras . We 're dropping in a remote camera . I 've almost got it . George , you guys run a signal yet ? ( George ) Yeah , we 're working on it . Yes , sir . Yes . They 're blocking our cameras . They won 't let us see the queen . [ gun cocking ] I 'm gonna leave , forget to lock the door behind me . You can 't tell anyone I 'm doing this . Your secret is safe . Wait ten minutes for the rest of the soldiers to leave the area , then take the back stairs . Good luck . Thank you . Thank you . [ distant helicopters ] [ cell phone beeps ] ( Rachel ) What 's happening ? Where are you taking us ? [ thumping ] [ distant spider noise ] [ gun cocking ] [ whimpers ] [ guns cocking ] [ sobs ] We 're gonna be all right . No , we 're not . Yes , yes . You have to know that . [ spider noises ] ( Jenkins ) Hold your fire ! [ whimpers ] [ gunshot ] Fall back ! This is Black Steak One . Request air support and backup . We 're being overrun . Air support and backup . Repeat ! We are overrun ! ( Jenkins ) Get back ! Get back ! [ continuous gunfire ] [ screams ] [ screaming ] [ groans ] [ grunting ] Oh . What is that ? [ glass breaks ] [ shouts ] Come on ! [ grunting ] Go , go , go ! [ spider roaring ] [ screams ] Tell Jenkins l 'm coming up top . [ panting ] No , no . Don 't look . Just close your eyes . ( Rachel ) Hey ! Shh , Rach . Rach ! You must go now . Thank you . Oh , Jenkins . ( Darnoff ) This is all his fault . I was set to change the world . [ thud , creaking ] [ crumbling ] [ hissing steam ] [ explosion ] [ spider grunting ] [ screeching ] You are so beautiful . [ screeching ] [ machine-gun fire ] [ screeching ] [ screaming ] [ roaring ] [ screeching ] Come on ! This way ! [ screaming ] No ! [ screaming ] [ screeching ] [ horn honking ] ( Jason ) Oh , no ! No , baby ! No , baby ! Have you seen a little girl about twelve ? This is a military zone . You have to leave the area . She 's got blond hair . She 's with an older girl about 1 9 . Have you seen her ? No . No ? Everyone 's been evacuated . That 's a transfer truck . People made it out . People made it out . They made it out , I know they made it out . Em ? Emily ?

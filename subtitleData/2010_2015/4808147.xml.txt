 THIS IS THE TRIGGER I NEED . IT 'S AN INITIATING REACTOR . IT 'S LOST ITS CHARGE . WITHOUT TH PCE , I CANNOT RESET TIME . IF YOUR PLAN IS SUCCESSFUL , WE WILL CEASE TO EXIST . IF OUR PLAN DOESN 'T SUCCEED , THEY WILL CEASE TO EXIST . AFTER ALL THIS TIME THE FEELINGS YOU HAD FOR THESE PEOPLE ... THE FEELINGS WE ALL HAD , THEY HAVE NOT GROWN IN YOU ? WHEN WE FIRST CAME , WHEN WE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE EMOTIVE DEVELOPMENT BY BEING IN THIS ERA , WE AGREED , THE 12 OF US , TO SPEAK NOTHING OF IT . YOU LOST CONTROL , AS DID AUGUST . WE AGREED , THE 12 OF US , TO SPEAKWHEN WE FIRST CAME HERE WE DID NOT KNOW THE TRUE NATURE OF OUR EXPEDITION . WE WERE NOT TOLD . THE PEOPLE OF THIS ERA , THIS IS THEIR DESTINY . DESTINY CAN BE CHANGED . BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE WILL TO CHANGE IT ... EVEN IF IT REQUIRES SACRIFICE . I TOOK A RISK EVEN COMING TO SEE YOU BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF THIS ERA ARE WORTH SAVING . ( Walter ) IT NEEDS TO BE AT A 22 DEGREE ANGLE . 22 DEGREES . CAN YOU HEAR ME ? BLASTED THING . WHAT I WOULDN 'T GIVE FOR A GOOD , OLD-FASHIONED TUMOR-INDUCING CELL PHONE . I CAN HEAR YOU . 22 DEGREES . YEAH , COPY THAT . AND MAKE SURE IT 'S ON AN EVEN PLANE . ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL . [ device beeps ] OKAY . STOP . WE 'RE THERE . WHAT 'S THE ENERGY METER READING ? [ cell phone rings ] YOU WILL SEE A RED LIGHT ON . HELLO ? IT 'S ME . WHERE ARE YOU ? ( Peter ) WE HAVE THE BOY . WE 'RE ON OUR WAY . ONCE THAT NEWS STARTS BREAKING I WANT TO BE OUT OF HERE . I 'M GONNA GET A FEW THINGS WE 'LL NEED AND COME DIRECTLY TO YOU . ( Peter ) GOOD ENOUGH . SPEAK SOON . [ door closes ] [ Broyles , distorted speech ] IT 'S ME . WHERE ARE YOU AT NOW ? [ Peter , distorted ] WE HAVE THE BOY . WE 'RE ON OUR WAY . WE HAVE THE BOY . WE 'RE ON OUR WAY . ( Broyles ) ONCE THE NEWS STARTS BREAKING , I WANT TO BE OUT OF HERE . I 'M GONNA GET A FEW THINGS WE 'LL NEED AND COME DIRECTLY TO YOU . ( Carol ) HERE YOU ARE , SIR . THE CHECKPOINTS . THANK YOU , CAROL . I , UH , I 'LL BE GONE FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON . AGENT BROYLES . I WOULD LIKE A WORD WITH YOU . [ mysterious music ] ♪ YOU ARE AWARE WE HAD A LEVEL ONE SECURITY BREACH TODAY , RESULTING IN THE ABDUCTION OF A HIGH-VALUE DETAINEE FROM OUR FACILITY . NO . NO , I DIDN 'T KNOW THAT . THE FUGITIVES KNEW PRECISELY WHERE WE WERE HOLDING THE PRISONER . YOU THINK THAT INFORMATION CAME FROM SOMEONE IN MY DIVISION ? WE ARE EXPLORING ALL POSSIBILITIES . I HAVE HEARD WHISPERS THAT THE RESISTANCE OPERATIVE KNOWN AS " THE DOVE " MAY BE AMONG US . WELL , IF THAT WERE TRUE , WHOEVER IT IS SHOULD HAVE BEEN READ AND EXPOSED LONG AGO . I DO NOT WISH TO KEEP YOU ANY LONGER FROM YOUR DUTIES . REMAIN VIGILANT , PHILLIP . [ exhales ] [ door opens and closes ] ( September ) WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ? ( Olivia ) WHY WOULD HE STEP OFF THE MONORAIL ? I MEAN , WHY WOULD HE DO THAT ? HE KNOWS TOO MUCH . HE MUSHAVE KNOWN THAT THEY WANTED TO HARM HIM . APPARENTLY ... THERE WAS A REASON . THERE ALWAYS IS . ( Walter ) I 'VE SPOKEN TO ANIL AND HIS MEN . THE MAGNET HAS BEEN POSITIONED ON THE TRUCK AS YOU REQUESTED . WE 'RE MISSING AN IMPORTANT PART . THE INITIATING REACTOR 'S CORE DECAYED SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS . I ENLISTED HELP TO SURE ANOTHER ONE FROM MY TIME . AN OBSERVER ? ONE I TRUST . BUT ONE OF YOU WILL NEED TO RETRIEVE IT . ( Peter ) SO WHAT IS THE INITIATING REACTOR ? ( Walter ) IT PROVIDES A SURGE OF ENERGY TO START UP THE DEVICE . THE PURPOSE OF THIS MACHINE IS TO GENERATE A SINGULARITY . ESSENTIALLY , A SMALL WORMHOLE . AND ONCE IT 'S OPEN , THEN WE 'LL BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE CYLINDERS . THEY SERVE TO STABILIZE EACH END . AND ONE WILL REMAIN HERE IN OUR PRESENT AS AN ANCHOR . THE OTHER ONE WILL BE SENT TO A SPECIFIC POINT IN THE FUTURE- - 2167 . HOW DO WE GET THEM TO 2167 ? THAT 'S WHAT THE MAGNET IS FOR . IT 'S USED AS A LAUNCH PLATFORM . IT WILL HOLD THE CYLINDER AT THE PRECISE AXIS IT NEEDS TO BE TO ENTER THE WORMHOLE , ENSURING TT THE CYLINDER REACHES ITS DESTINATION . AND THE SCROLLS ARE TO HELP US SET THOSE CYLINDERS PRECISELY . WE 'LL NEED TWO GENERATORS TO POWER THE MAGNET . ALL READY WITH ANIL . IF YOU 'RE GONNA RUN THE MAGNET OFF OF TWO GENERATS , THEY 'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE IN PERFECT PHASE . WE 'LL NEED A SYNCHROSCOPE AS WELL . I KNOW THAT AND I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT . IT WOULD BE ONE OF THEM , IN THERE , PROBABLY NEAR THE FISH TANK . AND MICHAEL ? HE WILL TRAVERSE THE WORMHOLE TO 2167 . HE 'LL MEET THE SCIENTIST IN OSLO , NORWAY . AND THAT MEETING WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION . HOW WILL HE KNOW WHO THE SCIENTIST IS ? THERE WILL BE SOMEONE THERE TO GUIDE HIM . [ cell phone ringing ] IT 'S BROYLES . YOU GOOD ? I 'M LEAVING FOR BOSTON . I 'M COMING TO YOU . ( traffic control worker ) THIS IS AGENT PAT WILKINS . I HAVE HIM ON THE SPRING STREET , NUMBER 49 . NORTHBOUND , LANE TWO . ( officer 1 ) COPY THAT , TRAFFIC CONTROL . BRAVO UNIT IS ON STANDBY TO CONTINUE SURVEILLANCE . ( officer 2 ) BRAVO UNIT HAS VISUAL . HE 'S 200 METERS AHEAD IN THE RIGHT LANE . ( officer 1 ) COPY THAT . CALL US WHEN YOU 'RE CLOSE . PETER 'S GONNA MEET YOU AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE STEAM TUNNEL . BROYLES , ARE YOU THERE ? CAN YOU HEAR ME ? HELLO ? THEY 'RE FOLLOWING ME . WINDMARK IS LETTING ME LEAD THEM TO YOU I 'LL LEAD THEM AROUND AS LONG AS I CAN . BUT IT 'S ONLY A MAERF TIME BEFORE THEY REALIZE I 'M NOT LEADING THEM TO YOU . IF I 'M CAUGHT , THEY 'LL READ ME . I 'MI CAN PROTECT MY THOUGHTS , BUT THERE 'S ONLY SO LONG THAT 'LL LAST . OKAY , WINDMARK IS NOT GOING TO READ YOU BECAUSE WE 'RE GOING TO COME AND GET YOU . THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE PLAN . LISTEN TO ME , PHILLIP , YOU NEED TO TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE . OLIVIA ... JUST GET IT DONE . JUST TELL ME WH- - [ cell phone beeps ] YOU HEARD HIM . IF HE 'S CAPTURED , IT 'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY KNOW WE 'RE HERE . PETER , START EXCAVATING THAT SYNCHROSCOPE . WE NEED TO GO GET THE NEW INITIATOR . AND WE NEED TO GATHER EVERYTHING THAT IS REQUIRED AND LEAVE . IT 'S OUR ONLY CHANCE . ( Walter ) PETER , HOW ARE YOU DOING WITH THEY SYNCHROSCOPE ? ( Peter ) NO SYNCHROSCOPE YET . BUT I FOUND ME SORT O. ANY IDEA WHAT THAT WAS FOR OR WHY YOU HAD IT ? I HAVE NO IDEA . THIS TAPE IS ADDRESSED TO ME . IT 'S YOUR HANDWRITING . PETER , I SENT YOU A LETTER . IT CONTAINS SOMETHING OF MINE . WHAT LETTER , WALTER ? I IMAGINE YOU CALLED ME TO ASK WHY WOULD YOU SEND SUCH A STRANGE LETTER ? AND WHEN YOU TRIED TO CALL , I DIDN 'T ANSWER . SO YOU CAME TO FIND ME AT THE LAB . BUT I WAS NOT TO BE FOUND . WAS HERE ONE MOMENT AND VANISHED FROM THE FACE OF THE EARTH THE NEXT . I WANT YOU TO KNOW I 'M FINE . AND LIVING MANY , MANYEARS FROM NOW . WHAT IS THIS , WALTER ? YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN . YOU WILL NEREE ME AGAIN BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE THIS WAY TO ENSURE THE FUTURE OF OUR HUMANITY . YOUR FUTURE . THE FUTURE OF OLIVIA . AND THE FUTURE OF ETTA . I DON 'T WANT YOU TO BE SAD . THE TIME WE HAD TOGETHER WE STOLE . I CHEATED FATE TO BE WITH YOU . AND WE SHOULDN 'T HAVE HAD THAT TIME TOGETHER , BUT WE DID . AND I WOULDN 'T CHANGE IT FOR THE WORLD . I DON 'T WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE . BUT I WILL SAY ... I LOVE YOU , SON . I WASN 'T TRUTHFUL WITH YOU . I DO KNOW WHAT THAT IS . IT 'S AN INOCULATION FOR TIME TRAVEL . I 'M TAKING THE CHILD OBSERVER INTO THE FUTURE , PETER . I WAS ALREADY INOCULATED IN 2015 . I LEFT THIS ONE IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME AND SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO BRING THE BOY ACROSS TO COMPLETE THE PLAN . DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY ? YES ! WHY ? BECAUSE , PETER , THE BOY AND I , WE WILL BECOME A PARADOX . NATURE ABHORS A PARADOX . IT HAS TO HEAL ITSELF . IT DOES SO BY DELETING ME AND THE BOY AT THE MOMENT OF THE INVASION . THE BOY AND I WILL DISAPPEAR AFTER 2015 . SO IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A FUTURE WITHOUT THE OBSERVERS ... YOU AND MICHAEL HAVE TO LIVE OUT THE REST OF YOUR LIVES IN THE FUTURE . I KNOW IN MY SOUL THIS IS WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO . I WANT YOU TO GIVE OLIVIA YOUR DAUGHTER BACK . I WANT TO GIVE YOU YOUR LIFE BACK . AS A FATHER , HOW COULD I NOT DO THAT FOR YOU ? WHAT I SAID ON THE TAPE ABOUT STEALING TIME WITH YOU , I MEANT IT . I WOULDN 'T TRADE IT FOR THE WORLD . [ sobbing ] YOU ARE MY FAVORITE THING , PETER . MY VERY FAVORITE THING . ( Loyalist 1 ) WHERE 'S THE LOGBOOK ? YOU LEFT IT IN THE CAR . ( Loyalist 2 ) NO , I DIDN 'T . IT 'S IN THE OM HANG ON A SECOND . WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PART ? THIS WAS TAKEN FROM ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 12 SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TEAM . YOUR ORDER TO MONITOR THE REMAINING MEMBERS WAS WISE . WHEN DECEMBER TRAVELED TO THE FUTURE AND PROCURED THIS UNIT I WAS NOTIFI . WHAT IS THIS ? SEPTEMBER IS ASSEMBLING A DEVICE WITH THE FUGITIVES . IT IS A TRIGGER CONTAINING AN ATOMIC CHARGE THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO CREATE A WORMHOLE . THEY INTEND TO RESET TIME . HE 'S IN THE NUMBER SIX STAIRWELL . B-UNIT , COVER THE 61ST STREET EXIT . SUBJECT IS MOVING ON FOOT . REPEAT , HE 'S IN THE NUMBER SIX STAIRWELL . HE KNOWS THAT WE KNOW . [ grunts ] YOU 'RE SAYING WE CAN 'T COMPLETE THE PLAN BECAUSE WE 'RE MISSING ONE SINGLE PIECE ? WITHOUT THE INITIATING REACTOR THERE 'S NO WAY WE CAN OPEN THE WORMHOLE . THERE 'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH ENERGY . I THOUGHT THE ROCKS PROVIDED THE ENERGY . TO SUSTAIN THE REACTION , NOT TO TRIGGER IT . LIKE A CAR WITH A FULL TANK AND NO SPARKPL . WE 'RE STUCK . THERE MUST BE SOME PLACE WE CAN FIND ANOTHER IGNITION SOURCE . OR MAYBE WE CAN MAKE ONE OF OUR OWN . IT 'S IMPOSSIBLE . NOTHING STRONG ENOUGH IS AVAILABLE IN THIS TIME PERIOD . MICHAEL , I NEED YOUR HELP . WHEN I CROSSED OVER TO RESCUE YOU , YOU LOOKED AT ME LIKE YOU EXPECTED ME . YOU SMILED ... LIKE YOU KNEW I 'D COME FOR YOU . CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO NEXT ? WHAT ABOUT A SHIPPING LANE ? OF COURSE . IF WE COULD GAIN CONTROL OF THE SHIPPING LANE , WE CAN USE TT AS OUR WORMHOLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD WORK AS PLANNED . YOU ARE A GENIUS ! THIS IS THE SHIPPING MANIFEST I DECODED . IT 'LL GIVE US THE LOCATION IT 'S HIS SAND THE TIME OF THE NEXT SHIPMENT . SO WHEN IS IT OPENING ? TOMORROW MORNING AT 6 : 08 A.M. 40.7787 NORTH . 73.9776 WEST . IT 'S NEW YORK . OKAY , ASTRID , SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THE CHECKPOINTS . FIRST WE NEED AN END DOCK STABILIZER . WHAT IS AN END DOCK STABILIZER ? IT LOOKS LIKE A CUBE . AND YOU ACTIVATE IT AT THE LOCATION IWI KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN . IF WE RECALIBRATE IT , WE CAN REVERSE THE POLARITY AND CHANGE THE DIRECTIONAL FLOW OF THE SHIPPING LANE SO THAT IT WILL SEND RATHER THAN RECEIVE . [ cell phone rings ] ANIL ? BROYLES . HE 'S BEEN CAPTURED . I PUT OUT FEELERS . I 'LL KEEP YOU INFORMED . WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE PLAN ? IT 'S HAPPENING TOMORROW MORNING . THERE 'S ONE OTHER THING WE NEED FIRST . ( Walter ) PETER . HOLD ON TSE TIGHT . ANTI-GRAVITY OSMIUM BULLETS . SHOOT OBSERVERS WITH THESE AND WATCH THEM FLOAT AWAY LE BALLOONS . IF WE SHOOT ' EM , THEY 'RE DEAD . WHY DO WE WANT ' EM TO FLOAT AWAY ? BECAUSE IT 'S COOL . THAT MAKES SEN , WALTER . OKAY . I 'LL START LOADING THE CAR . YOU GONNA BE OKAY ? ( Astrid ) WALTER ? THERE 'S SOMETHING I WANNA SHOW YOU . PETER ... I WANT TO TALK TO YOU . GENE . I WAS GONNA LET HER OUT . BUT I WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD HEAR HER MOO . YES . SHE DOES MOO QUITE LOUDLY . ESPECIALLY AFTER A MEAL . I AT LEAST WANTED YOU TO SEE HER . YOU ALWAYS KNOW HOW TO SOOTHE ME . YOU ALWAYS HAVE . WALTER , THIS IS NOT THE END . WE 'RE GONNA WIN THIS . AND WHEN WE DO , WE 'LL BE ... DRINKING STRAWBERRY MILKSHAKES IN THE LAB AND NOT EVEN GONNA REMEMBER THAT THIS HAPPENED . THAT SOUNDS LOVELY . [ laughter ] IT 'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME . WHAT IS ? ASTRID . BEFORE WE ARRIVED HERE WE SENT A TEAM OF 12 . THEIR MISSION S OBSERVE AND REPORT . HOWEVER , A STRANGE PHENOMENON OCCURRED . TO SOME DEGREE OR OTHER , THEY SUCCUMBED TO IRRATIONAL EMOTIONS . YOUR KIND INFECTED THEM . BUT NOT YOU . YOU SEEM TO BE IMPERVIOUS TO EVERYTHING . I WILL NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN . BUT I WILL ADMIT THIS TO YOU , PHILLIP . I , TOO , FEEL SOMETHING . I BELIEVE YOU CALL IT ... HATE . THE FEELING IS MUTUAL . [ distorted , overlapping mental voices ] WHAT ? REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT WE HAD A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE SEEING HER AGAIN ? IT 'S NOT THAT LONG ANYMORE . WE 'RE GONNA SEE HER . WE 'RE GONNA HAVE HER BACK . THG ELSE MATTERS . HE 'S HERE . HEY . HI . THIS IS AN AIR INTAKE SUPPLY LINE . IT LEADS TO HALF THE BUILDING . THAT 'S ENOUGH , BELIEVE ME . GOOD LUCK . WE NEED TO GET GOING . WE HAVE TO MEET THEM . I GAVE MYSELF THE LAST INOCULATION . I 'M GOING WITH HIM , WALTER . I 'M TAKING HIM INTO THE FUTURE . I 'VE ALREADY TOLD PETER ABOUMYECISION . I KNOW YOU ONCE BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS YOUR DESTINY , A PRICE YOU HAD TO PAY . I NEED THIS . I HAVE PREPARED SELF FOR THIS . I 'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS SINCE I FIRST SAW THE BOY AGAIN . WALTER , 20 YEARS AGO WHEN I AGREED TO LET YOU BE THE ONE TO TAKE HIM , I DIDN 'T HAVE THE FEELINGS I HAVE NOW . LATER , WHEN I BEGAN TO REALIZE THE HEIGHT OF HIS INTELLEC AND WHAT YOU CALL THE DEPTHS OF HIS EMOTIO STILL , I COULDN 'TUNRSTAND WHAT S THAT I MEANT TO HIM . AND I WAS UNABLE TO RECIPROCATE . WHEN I SAW YOU ... WHEN I SAW PETER AND SAW WHAT HE MEANT TO YOU ... THEN I UNDERSTOOD WHAT MY FEELINGS WERE . AND WHYTH WERE IMPORTANT . I CAN 'T COMMUNICATE WITH HIM IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS . WHEN I TAKE HIS ND AND I LEADIM ... I CAN 'T COMMUNICATE WITH HIM IN THE TRADITIONAL WAYS . HE 'LL KNOW THAT I LOVE HIM . THAT 'S BEING A FATHER . IT NOT ABOUT FATE , WALTER . YOURS OR MINE . IT 'S ABOUT CHANGING FATE . IT 'S ABOUT HOPE . AND PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN . THINK ABOUT THEM , PHILLIP . THINK ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE . THEY WILL UNDERSTAND YOU HAD NO CHOICE . IT IS ACCEPTABLE .

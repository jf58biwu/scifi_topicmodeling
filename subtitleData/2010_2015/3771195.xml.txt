 It was just a normal day in Eureka : Day 's not over yet . Yeah , like that was gonna last . Hello , 1947 . Confused ? Let me clarify . The five of us got transported back in time through some wormhole thingy thanks to the bridge device . We eventually found our way back home , but , surprise , home wasn 't exactly the way we left it . Henry ... Married . Zane and Jo ... Never dated . But Jo 's in charge of G.D. Security . Kevin ... Different , much to Allison 's surprise . And Fargo ... The head of Global Dynamics , much to everyone 's surprise . Oh , and Dr. Old Spice hitched a ride back with us to the present . But there was one crappy rule . We can 't tell anyone . If anyone found out about our trip , there 'd be in trouble . Some of us had a harder time with it than other I 'm not your Henry , not yet . It 's way off target and that 's a residential area . That was Jo 's house , so she 's living with me for a while . And I finally kissed Allison ... 63 years ago . But , of course , Dr. Charles Grant had to get in the way . At least let me buy you a drink . One drink . Don 't plan the wedding just yet . May the best man win . But that 's Eureka for you ... Same town , big changes . You know , I think I like the hair . You look very mature . Yeah , and it really sells the fake I.D. to the bars in Cambridge . Kidding . Unclench . Yeah . So when does Lucas come back from M.I.T. ? He 's not . Internship in Geneva , which isn 't a bad thing . You guys having trouble ? That would make it a lot easier . No . It 's just he 's a great guy , but , you know , college changes you ... What you want , who you want . Oh , that 's not , hair boy . You know , maybe what starts in the friend zone should stay in the friend zone . - Sheriff . Hey , Zoe . - Hey , Zane ! - Looking good . - Thanks . That 's my girl ! That 's my girl . Hey ! Jenna 's gotten so big . Allison seems so happy . Yeah . Yeah , she does . Fresh baked cinnamon roll , raisin-free and icing-rich , just the way you like it . Welcome home . Aw , thanks , Vin ! It 's so good to be back . I think I 'll have one . Thanks , Vince . You bet . Okay , so ... Though ... I think some of the greatest romances in history started in the friend zone . Like what ? And TV characters do not count . So you ready for spa day ? I 've got us booked for shangri-la facials and mani-pedis . Shangri-la facials ? Well , this doesn 't happen by magic , my friend . I can 't wait . So what are you guys talking about ? Whether it 's better to stay with someone safe but dull or take a risk on someone new . I think ... I think newer isn 't always better . You 've already found someone new . That obvious ? Well , nothing 's happened yet . We 've just been holo-skyping . But he 's funny and smart and so hot . Yeah , and I think that 's my cue to leave . I 'll meet you outside . Funny , smart , and hot ... Sounds like a trifecta . Yeah , I don 't know . I mean , he 's a little bit older . If he makes you happy , go for it . Life 's short . And everything can change in a blink . Oh , it 's my contractor . Wait till you see the plans for my new house . Zimmer , what 's going on ? - Let me get your coat . - Thank you . A gentleman always takes street side . Were all men as chivalrous in your day ? If they wanted a chance with a gal like you , they were . Well , I say we need more men like you in 2010 . You know what we didn 't have in my day ? Coffee like this . I enjoyed the highballs the other night . - The drinks . - Oh , yes ! So did I. Thank you . How about we go crazy next time and make it dinner ? - Well ... - Hey , guys . Why aren 't you catching up on 60 years of fun facts ? 'Cause I find the present far more alluring . That 's great . I need you ... Police business . - Could take a while . - Okay , sport . Ladies . To be continued . " Police business " ? Ah , all my business is police business . So what 's up , Carter ? Well , it 's ... Really more of a longer conversation . Maybe you and I could grab a bite ? I just ate . No , not ... " Just ate . " No , later . Like , say , dinner ? Oh , okay , well , Kevin 's gonna be at Dre 's . And I have the nanny tonight . Yeah , sure . What time ? - Say 8 : 00 ? - Yeah . That sounds good . Okay . Hey , Jenna , say good-bye to Carter . - Say bye-bye . - Bye . Why 'd it take me four years to do that ? Well , tell him if he doesn 't move that thing today , I will move it for him . They haven 't even poured the foundation for my house , which means that I get to keep living with the both of you and S.A.R.A.H. and her mechanical boyfriend . And , oh , my God , I need my own space . Mechanical boyfriend ? S.A.R.A.H. ' s been spending time with deputy Andy . Your house is getting more action than either of us . I try not to think about it . So what 's ... What 's the holdup on the swinging new bachelorette pad ? Some pinhead named Thurgood found a fossil on the site and shut down construction . - Wait , Derek ? - Der ... Who 's Derek ? Dr. Derek Thurgood . He taught my paleoanthropology class last year at Tesla . The guy 's a genius . Really ? Well , why don 't you come and watch me kick his smart ass off my property ? Well , let 's . You don 't know what a big deal this is . You 'll just have to give us more time . You have had three days to move it . Well , I was working on it , but this little intimidation stunt of yours isn 't helping you . Hey , Zoe , welcome back . Congratulations , Derek . This is really cool . Oh , really cool . So take your fancy laser shovel and haul it back to G.D. That 's a delicate process , and it can 't be rushed . Besides , who knows what else we might find here ? What exactly did we find here ? The distal phalange of a 15,000-year-old pre-clovis culture hominid . - A pinky ! - That 's it ? - That 's a big deal , dad . - Come on . Then remove it . Well , I would , but , boss Lady Zimmer thought it would be funny to push me into flash-crete . - Into what now ? - It 's flash-crete . P.V.A.-Enhanced molecular-bonding concrete . Three-second set time . And he fell into it . I had a little help . If I had helped , you would 've gone in face-first . All right , let 's , get Indiana Jones out of the wall here . You got a chisel ? - Come on . - Here . It 's de-polymerizing spray ... For the clumsy and irritating . What about my house ... With the dojo and the firing range in the basement ? It was ... Ah . See for yourself . In Eureka , scientific discovery always trumps construction . It 's in the town charter . - Smells orange-y . - Yep , it 's the solvent . Dr. Fargo wanted this house fast-tracked . What am I supposed to do now ? Go home and brush up on local civics . I thought she 'd never leave . You know , Derek , if you have time , I 'd love to see the distal phalange . Well , I 'd love to show it to you . Carter , you have to do something . I know . - Were they flirting ? - I meant about my house ! Oh , great ! It 's 911 from Fargo . All right , Fargo , what 's the emergency ? Shh . You 're running sonic protocols . Big Brother could be eavesdropping . - On what ? - On me . Seems my mug may have drawn some unwanted attention from the D.O.D. They 've been snooping around Dr. Grant 's personnel file ... The one I manufactured . If they know I falsified documentation ... They may know that I 'm not Charles Grant , G.D. Historian , but Trevor Grant , G.D. History . We could be in a lot of trouble . Try sanctioned . We violated time-travel protocols . They 're gonna lock us up like lab rats . I don 't like the sound of that . Forever . Or that . What 's our play ? We trace the checks directly to the source . Hack the Pentagon . Are you insane ? The D.O.D. mainframe has dozens of firewalls laced with info-mines along every data path . It 's like trying to hack the Matrix . Well , then as much as it pains me to say , we need to get help from " the one . " Working with Derek is a chance to be part of history . You really want to hang with Mr. " I found a pinky " ? I thought you and Jo were going to the spa ? Oh , she postponed . You know , plus Derek and I have time at the A.M.S. lab tomorrow to start carbon-dating . You know , that skeleton could be the oldest north American hominid ever found . So ? Speaking of dating , check you out . - Thank you . - Hold on , photo op ... Your first real date with Allison . Oh , finally . This is big . Oh , crap , my phone 's in my bag . I must 've left it at the dig site . I got time . I can run you over . - Great ! - Great . S.A.R.A.H. , door . There you go . Well , that 's weird . Derek 's car 's still here . Derek ! I think I left it in the pit . Be careful . Derek ? Dad ! Any chance that 's just a really good statue of Thurgood ? No , there 's definitely a person encased in there . Prepare him for autopsy , please . It 's so horrible . You okay ? He was such an amazing teacher . He inspired everyone . Wait , where you going ? He would want everyone to focus on the find . So I 'm gonna go let everyone know . Well , I 've never seen anything like this before . - Yeah . - Or this . Got a date ? Actually , yeah ! Dinner ? Oh ! Oh , oh ! You meant a date . - Yeah , I did . - Oh , I 'm so sorry . I just wasn 't expecting ... Really ? Carter ... Look , we got out of focus . Shall we ? Yeah , you 're right . Oh , okay . So it looks like Thurgood was dropped in a vat of cement . Or pushed in ... I 'll go check with Zimmer . And , change out of my clothes . Oh , my God ! His heart 's beating . Carter , he 's still alive in there . Sheriff , I told you before , I 'd never use flash-crete on a person . - Except when you did . - Okay . But not on a person 's entire person . Mm-hmm . And , tell me again what you did after I left yesterday . My crew cleaned up the site and then cleared out . Thurgood was still mucking about in his pit when we went back to the warehouse . I swear . Hey , hey , hey ! What , you 're not gonna leave me in here , are you ? On what charges ? Probable cause or just because ... Take your pick . It 's , beautiful , Henry . - What 's the occasion ? - You and me . A new beginning . And I 've got everything here . I 've got plantains , Caribbean sauteed pork , and Vincent 's famous sangria . All my favorites . - Something wrong ? - No , no . It 's perfect . Re-creating our first date was a lovely idea . Re ... He did this too ... Other Henry ? I ... I 'm sorry , Grace . I ... I ... I didn 't know . How could you ? But , really , Henry , I love this . Come on , let 's have some sangria . Not to worry ... My flash-crete solvent is like elixir of the gods . It works miracles on skin . It 's our most popular treatment at the Shangri-la spa . It takes only seconds . Dr. Vicelli , it 's been seconds with no improvement . In fact , whatever he 's covered with is getting thicker . Yeah , Hmm , I 'm afraid that this one is kind of out of my league . I mean , your situation , I can help . What , you mean the situation of my face ? I 'm sorry . I do that . It 's part of the job . I mean , really , you look great . But , in five years ... Prep for laser surgery . Let 's get this stuff off of him before it kills him . That 's a good idea . Sonic protocols . This just gets curiouser and curiouser . Less talking , more typing . You know , it might help a smidge if you tell me what I 'm looking for . Just get in first . The D.O.D. uses an application gateway . You know , I could get in a lot of trouble for this . I think I deserve a fair trade for my services . So who wants to start the bidding , Hmm ? You 're trying to play us , sport ? I just think a little compensation for my particularly awesome set of illegal skills is in order . Zane , I know it 's a stretch , but if you could try not to be a selfish jackass ... I really could use a new quantum fluctuation generator . Fine . Now get on with it . You 're the boss . I 'll start by cutting 0.5 millimeters . Hold on . Is that a tattoo ? Looks like an octopus . His skin isn 't covered in concrete . It is concrete . Hello ? Anyone here ? Hello ? Hello ? Sheriff , please , help me . Oh , my God ! How can a person petrify ? Well , I don 't know , but they 're both alive and petrifying from the outside in . How does that affect their clothes ? Well , you remember the woman who was fused to the fabric of her couch after sitting there for six years ? No . I mean ... Wait , who ? Well , it 's like that , but much faster . That 's disgusting . And at the rate that it 's moving inward , it 's only a matter of hours before their vital organs solidify , even less for Derek . How does it happen ? More detail . Well , in theory , any organic material can be converted into minerals through impregnation by a silicate , like quartz . Okay . Okay . Carter , what are you doing ? Main ingredient in flash-crete is silica . I used to work construction . I 'm good with my hands . Carter , flash-crete 's been used safely in buildings all over Eureka . Well , maybe somebody re-jiggered the formula . Dr. Zimmer does have a PhD in materials engineering . Bad news , Dr. Zimmer ... You 've gone from probable cause to ... Stone . Well ? She 's lucky that you found her . She 's okay ... Well , she 's not okay , but she 's not ... Dead ... Yet . I have the analysis you asked for . If there 's anything else I can do , please ... Oh , my ! What ? Sorry . Nothing . Here . Please ... - First treatment 's on me . - Oh , wow ! Carter , the flash-crete is just flash-crete ... Same formula as always . - No re-jiggering or ... ? - None . The flash-crete is not causing the fossilization . Wait , I thought you said these guys were petrifying . Carter , petrification is a form of fossilization . Petr ... I think we might be blaming the wrong guy . Hmm . Interesting . Interesting ? It 's not supposed to be interesting . Well , the people checking up on you are real badasses . Who are we talking ... N.S.A. , C.I.A. ? Worse ... I.R.S. Seriously , who claims 11 dependents ? What ? Yeah , accounting flagged your W-4 . The D.O.D. accounting department ? They 're the one 's poking around in your file ? That 's supposed to be a 1 , not an 11 . Larry . So anything else you want to know while I 'm in there ... Launch codes , defense plans , TARDIS blueprints ? Go away . Fine . Oh , and , doc , you might want to fill out your own paperwork next time . I 'll do that . Thank you . Nice doing business with you , Fargo . - Hey , dad . - Hey . How well do you know Thurgood ? Hold on . - That 's weird . - What 's that ? Maybe not as well as I thought . Check this out . Yeah , I don 't know what that is . Well , I 'm pretty sure that means it 's not a pre-clovis hominid phalange , which would mean that I might know what 's causing Derek to petrify . Do you think you can get me into his home lab ? Well , nothing out of the ordinary ... Unless you count all of it . So , what are you looking for exactly ? - Derek 's perm solution . - Derek 's perm solution . Maybe he keeps it next to his European man purse . Perm , as in permineralization . What 's it do exactly ? I think I found it . Okay , no sign of quartz in your cellular walls . So she 's okay , then ? Yes , along with the rest of the archaeological team . Great . I can 't believe Derek was trying to pull a piltdown . A what down now ? Well , Thurgood 's skeleton was a piltdown man ... An ape-like skeleton found in England in 1912 . Turned out to be a hoax . So the skeleton isn 't real ? Well , it 's not really old . It looked old . Yeah , that 's the point . The perm solution ... It introduces silica and calcite . And it does it super fast . We used it in Derek 's class to study the process of fossilization . Yeah , but a skeleton treated with perm would never stand up to radiometric dating . Well , yeah , unless Derek tweaked the photon emissions rate . The quartz in the skeleton that he found didn 't look right , so I measured it . It was like perm on steroids . So he re-jiggered the perm . I mean , I knew someone re-jiggered something . But now that we know that Thurgood 's perm is the culprit , I may be able to synthesize an antiserum to reverse the effects . Question ... How come some people at the site got fossilized and others didn 't , like Zoe ? I don 't know . Maybe a genetic predisposition or an allergic reaction . I 'll have the archaeological lab closed off , test anyone who came in contact with it at the site . Great . I 'll head over there and , quarantine the perm . Can I talk to you for a sec ? Look , I know this has been tough on you , so ... Why don 't you get away for a little while ? To the spa ? I can 't go now . Look , I ... There 's nothing you can do . It would make me feel better . And by the time you get back , Derek will probably be his old , fraudulent , flesh-colored self . How can you be so sure ? Well , I can 't . But Allison 's working on it . Thanks . So what now ? Well , the computer 's running panels on how to reverse-engineer the perm 's effects . An antidote ? Well , that 's the hope . Great . Keep me posted . Hey , could ... Could ... Can I borrow you ? When Grant asked you out , did you think that was a date date ? Well ... Yeah . Sure . Why not me ? - Really ? - Well ... Okay . " A , " you 've never asked me for a date . " B , " you kissed me and acted like it never happened . I mean , I know , you know , you had to come back to Tess , but , I mean , seriously , it 's been over a month . - And " C " ... - Hold on ! You were thinking about the kiss ? It 's been over 60 years . I don 't know . Who can remember ? You thought about it . Carter ... Go set up the quarantine . Yes , ma 'am . So you did . The soil definitely runneth over with ... modified perm . Must 've leached from the treated skeleton into the surrounding area . Ah ! That 's it . We 're ready ? All right , hold on . Consider the area quarantined . - Great . Thanks . - You 're welcome . Sorry for pulling you away from Grace . No , you didn 't . She went out . Beach blanket bingo wasn 't a hit ? No , it was ... Both times . It turns out that I took her on the exact , same first date as the Henry from her time line . - No ! - Yeah . She was okay with that ? No , no , she ... She was wonderful . I just want to give her the passion and surprises that she deserves . But , you know ... Anything I come up with , you know , he 's probably already done . It 's hard to win a girl when you 're competing against yourself . Exactly . So what do you think I should do ? Well , you can find the person you 'd be least likely to go to for advice . Ask them . I thought that 's what I was doing . I walked right into that , didn 't I ? Mm-hmm . - Thanks , Jack . - Good luck . I can 't relax . Derek ... Is in the best hands possible . Trust me . Okay . I 'm really glad you were here , Grace . Yeah , me too . All right , so tell me all about Harvard . Guys , grades ... I want all the gossip . Grades are good . Guys are ... Complicated . " Guys , " as in someone new ? Well , he 's not exactly new . He ... I needed help with a physics model last semester . He totally knew how to use a Ornstein-Zernike equation in molecular electronic structure theory . Okay , that is hot ! Right ? It 's that rush you get when you 're first getting to know someone , you know ? Yeah . It 's too bad you can 't have both . Yeah . Too bad . What happened ? Derek 's system is shutting down ... I 'm losing him . I thought you were on to something with the perm . Well , so did I , but the new compound didn 't reverse the petrification ... It just slowed it down . But you were partially right , right ? Well , Thurgood and the others must 've been exposed to some sort of bio-activator ... Something that changed the perm in some way . I 'm guessing there 's lots of those . I 'm gonna have to cross-reference everything in their systems , see if I can find a match . If you ... Do they have that sort of time ? The others , maybe , but Derek ... I 'll ask Zoe . Maybe she knows if they have something in common . - Zoe , hey . - Hey ! Can I talk to you for a second ? Yeah . Okay , yeah . We 'll talk about it later . Sheriff . Zane . Zoe . That 's him . - Zane ? - Yeah . He 's the new guy ? What ... I know what you 're thinking , but he 's really sweet once you get to know him . What ... When ... did you get to know him ? - Just give it a chance . - No ! He 's a train wreck . Just ask Jo . Jo ? Why would I ask her ? Those two hate each other . Well , because ... Of his poor work ethic , which ... Look , we can discuss this later , okay ? - Allison needs our help . - Dad . Look , something activated the perm . We got to find out what it is before more people are affected . - Come on . - Dad ! What ? What ? It 's too late . I can 't feel my hands . It 's all over me . Just look at me , okay ? You stay with me . You look ... You 're gonna be okay , all right ? - It 's gonna be okay . - Damn ! - What 's wrong ? - It 's blocked . - Dad ... - Allison . Stay with me . Look at me , all right ? Just look in my eyes . I still might be able to get it into the subclavian artery . When you become a doctor , never do that . All right , sweetie , you 're gonna get sleepy . Just relax . There . See ? It 's gonna be okay . - Is that a cure ? - No . But we will find one , okay ? Just stay with her . Lupo ! You going somewhere ? Just grabbing some stuff for Carter , in case he spends the night with Zoe . Is she okay ? I hope so . I got to go . No , wait . I pulled something off the D.O.D. mainframe you need to see . It 's Grant 's personnel file . Two felonies in one day ... Impressive . Not as impressive as his profile . - He 's a fake . - What makes you think that ? Come on , when you 've created as many aliases as I have , you know what to look for . Dr. Charles Grant reads like a textbook cover , Jo . Chuck 's hiding something . - Like what ? - I don 't know . You 're the head of security . Don 't you want to find out ? Zane , Grant went through detailed background checks like everyone at G.D ... I did them myself . Look , I know we 've had our trust issues , but something isn 't right about this guy . I can feel it . He is Dr. Charles Grant , historian . Trust me . I really got to go . - Knock , knock . - Come . Hey , I never thought you tickled the ivories . Oh , this was there for you in the mailroom , Dr. Grant . I thought I 'd deliver it to you personally . Thanks . Leave it over there . All right . You know , all I got was a paperweight when I started working here . Not that it isn 't practical , I just would 've preferred an iTablet or ... Or a Cheval Nuit from 1947 . Let me see that . You know , they say it 's not healthy to drink alone . But I 'm available to hang out . Like guys do . Right . You 're busy ... Like everyone always is . We 've tested hundreds of potential bio-activators . Nothing has reacted with the perm . It 's like looking for a needle in a haystack . We need to narrow it down . Allison , you gave Zoe a clean bill of health earlier . I know . I 'm sorry . I ... I 'm trying to figure it out . I 'm not blaming you , but if Zoe was fine then , then she obviously came in contact with the bio-activator since then . Well , we need to find out everything that she was exposed in the last couple hours , and that would narrow it down . - Well , I know where to look . - Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Got to go . - Okay . - Come on , Carter ! I believe that Zoe had the Shangri-la special . Ah , yes , molecular steam bath , mani-pedi ... Deep penetration for all skin types . - It 's ... It 's very refreshing . - Yeah , I smell oranges . Yeah , like at the construction site . Right . Oh , you have a very keen nose ... With unfortunately roomy pores , but we have treatments for that . Thanks . Do you use flash-crete solvent ? On the face ? No . Never . The solvent is a derivative of my hand dip . The active ingredient in both is limonene . It 's excellent for purifying the skin . Were Zoe 's hands dipped in the limonene ? Yes , of course , it 's part of the Shangri-la experience . Zimmer , Thurgood , and the crew all used limonene solvent at the site . All right , we 're gonna need a sample of that . - Now ! - Okay . Oh , okay . - Do you ... ? - Thank you . Thanks . Thanks . Yeah . Allison , please tell me you have some good news . Limonene was the bio-activation agent we were looking for . I 'm sensing a " but " in there somewhere . The antidote needs to be absorbed directly into the skin . So put it in a cream and slather it on . The petrification process has closed off Zoe 's pores . So we have a cure , but no way to deliver it ? Not yet . Okay ? All this technology and no way to give her the cure . Yeah , but she 's still breathing . Can 't she just inhale it ? No . The cure must be directly applied to the skin . But petrified tissue is porous on a microscopic level . If we could just take advantage of that somehow . Vicelli said that her molecular steam penetrates all skin types . Molecular steam might be small enough to penetrate . And if we aerosolize the cure , Vicelli might be able to deliver it . That 's it . Hurry . Come on , Jo ! Okay , hang on , Zo . We 're gonna help you , okay ? That 's it . The system 's ready . Okay , here we go ... Initiating steam . 10 % absorption . 50 % absorption . 80 % absorption . How can we tell if it 's working ? We 'll know soon enough . Come on . Nothing 's happening . We tried everything we could . Jack , I 'm so sorry . No . No . No . Come on . Come on . Come on . Come on , huh ? I 'm here . I got you back . - Hey . - Hi . Oh , wow ! Petrification does awesome things for your skin . Too bad about the whole " almost dying " part . Yeah . It was almost , right ? Derek ... ? Yeah . Yeah , he 's fine and the others too . It 's quite a homecoming , huh ? Sure wasn 't dull . How we doing ? Well , we 're not garden statuary anymore . Well , that 's a good start . I 'm gonna keep you here for another day just as a precaution . And don 't even think about arguing . If it avoids being grilled about my love life , I 'm all for it . Eh , don 't count on it . I 'll be right back . I don 't know how to thank you . I 'm just happy everything worked out okay . Well ... I wouldn 't say all okay . What 's Zane doing here ? Apparently , he and Zoe are friendly . Since when ? Since we changed stuff . Oh , could this get any worse ? - Hey , how 's our girl ? - She 's good . Yeah ? I 'm gonna sick . She asked my advice about her new guy . - Her new guy is my old guy ? - I know . I know . You must be really upset . And you probably want to kill him . Under normal circumstances , I 'd help you . Okay , but you 're not okay with this . No . No , I 'm not okay with this . And I keep telling myself that it 's a crush and that it 's not gonna last . What if it does ? I got to go . Okay . Henry , listen , about lunch today ... * It 's poetry in motion ! * * you turned your tender eyes to me * * as deep as any ocean * * as sweet as any harmony ... * What is going on ? * She blinded with science ... * * You blinded me ! * * With science ! * * When I 'm dancing close to her ... * * Blinded me with science ! * * Science ... * * I can smell the chemicals ... * * It 's poetry in motion * * and now she 's making love to me . * * The spheres are in commotion * * the elements in harmony . * * She blinded me with science ... * * She blinded with science ! * * And hit me with technology ... * So romantic ! So Zoe is on her way to a full recovery . Well , thanks to you . Well , it was a team effort . You know , Zoe said that what starts in the friend zone should just stay in the friend zone . Do you think that that 's right ? I think that good friends are hard to find . So you think the kiss was a mistake ? No . I think that what we have ... It 's really special . And if things didn 't work out between us ... Especially after everything that we 've been through ... What I 'm trying to say is ... Maybe ... Maybe it 's not worth the risk . Okay . Trevor Grant ? How do you know my name ? I 've known your name my whole life . I believe you knew my father , Adam , back in 1947 . Who are you ? My name is Beverly Barlowe . And we 've been waiting a very long time for you .

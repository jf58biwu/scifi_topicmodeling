 I 'm not sure if we 're even on the air . Uh ... this is uh a series of explosions ... This is a major incident ... The emergency is a major incident ... That 's a meteor hit . It does now appear to be a major attack ... Since they landed outside Hamburg five years ago , they have steadily advanced across Europe . We 've suffered millions of casualties and yet ... The evacuation of key government officials continuing ... Nothing we have done has been able to stop their advance ... Human costs , the Europeans ... . - ... have paid the highest ... - They appear to mimic ... and even anticipate our actions ... We could not defeat them in France , we 'll be fighting them in the streets of London , then New York , then Tokyo . All of humanity is at stake . After five years , we finally have a victory . These pictures are just in from Verdun . ... and the coalition victory was how low casualties were ... We have seen a stunning victory here today . The United Defense Force ... How do you convince people ... that this is a fight that can be won ? This is an alien invasion and a global war . With the new jack in technology and limited amount of training , we 've been able to create super soldiers . Look at Rita Vrataski , The Angel of Verdun ... . They 're calling her " The Angel of Verdun " ... You can see that 's the new hope for this war ... With the new jack in technology and limited amount of training , Rita Vrataski was able to kill hundreds of Mimics ... She was able to kill hundreds of Mimics on only her first day in combat . Imagine any army of Rita Vrataski 's . We 're managing to hold them back at the English Channel , - but for how long ? - It is a dangerous task ... and it 's easy to understand why people are so suspicious about this ... . Over seventy nations are joining the United Defense Force , which hopes to push them back once and for all . We 've got ' em contained , and with this new technology , we 're gonna defeat ' em . Operation Downfall is going to be the largest mechanized invasion in the history of mankind . We will be victorious . We fight . That 's what we do . LONDON Major William Cage . United Stated military . Welcome to London , Major . UNITED DEFENSE FORCE HEADQUARTERS The General will see you now . Thank you . Operation Downfall , the entire might of the UDF invading from France , the Mediterranean , Scandinavia , relieving pressure in the Eastern front and allowing the Russians and Chinese to push the enemy back , and we all meet in the middle , exterminating this Mimic scourge along the way . A lot of good soldiers are going to die tomorrow , Major , and when the smoke clears and the body bags start coming home , people tend to look for someone to blame , someone like me . Ideally I 'd prefer a different scenario . Please . A best selling memoir perhaps ? Maybe a career in politics ? Off the top of my head , I would go with the ... " The Sense of Manifest Destiny " " Rags to Riches : Rags Rise Through The Ranks . " " Born to Deliver . " You see people . Well , they 'd love that sort of thing . You misunderstand , Major . I didn 't ask you here to sell me , I want you to sell the invasion . Okay . You ship out to the coast in one hour . Your comrade is standing by . You 'll be on the beach with the first wave . I 'm sorry . The first wave , the beach ? You mean ... The front ? France . Satellite show minimum enemy movement down the coast . Little resistance . It 'd be exciting , something to tell your grandchildren . Well , I appreciate the confidence , General . I do ... I do this to avoid doing that . I ... I ... I was an ROTC in college , and war broke out , I lost my advertising firm and ... here I am . I do what I do . You ... you do what you do . But , ... I 'm not a soldier really . No , of course you 're not . That 's why I 'm embedding you with several hundred thousand men and women who are . Well it is an honor , General . I 'm afraid I 'm gonna have to decline . I can 't stand the sight of blood , not so much as a paper cut . Uh ... but , uh ... it 's sitting here thinking about this , a couple of names come to mind that I feel like I could recommend to you inste ... It 's not an offer , Major , it 's an order . General , I 'm an officer in the United States Military . You don 't even have that authority ... I 've spoken to your C.O. You are now under my command . You will retain your present rank of course . My secretary has all the details . Do a good job , Major . Good luck . Dismissed . General . I just inspired millions of people ... to join your army . And when the body bags come home , and they 're looking for someone to blame . How hard do you think it would be for me to convince people ... to blame you ? I 'd imagine a General would prefer to avoid that . Are you blackmailing me , Major ? I would prefer ... not to be filming acts of heroism and valor on that beach tomorrow . You won 't be . I 'm glad we could uh ... work this out . Now , if you 'll excuse me , General , I ... Thank you . Arrest this man . What ? Stop running ! Flight closing in 10 minutes . On your feet , maggot ! Now that 's no way to address an officer , Sergeant . That 's how I address a slack-jawed recruit right before I bust his hole with my boot heel . Maggot ! Hold up there , son . Can I help you , sir ? Where the hell am I , Sergeant ? Forward Operating Base , Heathrow . You just came in with the fresh recruits . Do I strike you as a fresh recruit ? No , sir , you do not . My name is Major William Cage , I 'm an American officer ... Officer ? This is Processing . There 's no officers down here . I got this , Sergeant . How the hell did you end up in Processing ? What was it ? Poker night ? Bachelor party ? If it 's all the same to you , Sergeant . I 'd like to explain that to my Commanding Officer in Washington . So if you just take me to the phone ... Haven 't you heard ? We 're t-minusing our whole S.H. out , we 're fixing to invade France . This whole F.O.P is on lockdown , no calls , in or out . You 're name 's Farell ? That 's right . Master Sergeant Farell . Master Sergeant Farell , you 're an American . No , sir . I 'm from Kentucky . Okay , well ... Look at me . And look at where I am . I 've been railroaded . It 's obvious , I don 't belong here . So please , Sergeant . There has to be a way I can make a phone call . I 'll get you sorted out , sir . Thank you . Right this way . - Where are you from in Kentucky , Sergeant ? - Little town called Science Hill . - Heard of it ? - I have now . - How about you , where are you from ? - Cranbury , New Jersey . They grow our cranberries there , do they ? Tomatoes , best I 've ever had . Why do they called Cranbury then ? Why do they call it Science Hill ? Never asked , don 't care . After you . You 're not taking me to a phone , are you , Sergeant ? No , I 'm not . Seems about the only honest thing you 've said to me so far is your name . Says here you 're a deserter . Says here you were caught impersonating an officer , It says here you 'd likely try to make an outside call , even compromise security of this operation . Anything to get out of combat duty tomorrow . But that 's not gonna happen . Ever . Private Cage . Rumor is a terrible thing . And not following these men , we 'll all reach the same conclusion . That you 're a coward and a liar , putting your life above theirs . The good new is there 's hope for you , Private . Hope in the form of glorious combat , battle is the great redeemer , fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged . The one place where all men truly share the same rank , regardless of what kind of parasitic scum they were going in . Squad ! This here is Private Cage . Private Cage . J Squad . Isn 't that an Officer 's uniform ? Or he 's showing off us the cufflinks . I see everyone is having a productive morning . You know it gives me a swell of pride knowing soldiers of your ... caliber will be leading the charge tomorrow . Tip of the spear . Edge of the knife . Crack of my ass . Private Kimmel , what is my view of gambling in the barracks ? Dislike it , Sergeant Farell . Nance , why do I dislike it ? Cause it maintains the notion that our fate is in hands other than our own . And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate ? Chorus . Through readiness and discipline , we are masters of our fate . You might call that notion ironic , but trust me , you 'll come around . Private Cage is a deserter . I 'm making you all personally responsible for his deliverance . He will be combat ready at 06 : 00 tomorrow . Combat ready ? Private Cage is under the delusion that he does not belong here , we must dissuade him of this delusion . If he tries to run , feel free dissuade him until he can 't piss standing up . You have to listen to me , I will never be combat ready ... I envy you , Cage . Tomorrow morning you will be baptized , born again . PT , ten minutes ! You 're not in uniform ... Private . It 's a new day , people ! Destiny calls . The world expects only one thing from us , that we will win ! Come on , Kimmel ! Let 's have it ! Oh , for Christ 's sakes , Kimmel !

Yeah , well , I 've never been with two girls at the same time before . But you can bet when that day comes , I 'll make it work . Uh ... Kimmel ? It 's Griff . Griff . Griff , listen to me . Think about this , man . I could hurt somebody . Not with the safety on your one . What ? Where is the safety ? Exactly ! DO NOT CROSS It 's time . Bloody hell ! It 's the full metal ... Move ! - Griff . - Serge ? Take care of Private Cage ! What , all day ? Something tells me he won 't be needing it that long . Griff ! Cage ! Cage ! We lost Germany . We lost France .

It 's a slaughter house ! Pull yourself together , Ford ! On your feet , people ! Get in line ! Nance , get me a sitrep ! Safety ? Griff , Ford , go to the front ! My safety ?

The good new is there 's hope for your , Private . Hope in the form of glorious combat , battle is the great redeemer , the fire and crucible ... - in which the only true heroes ... - in which the only true heroes are forged . Did you just interrupt me , Private ? Sergeant . You 're ... you 're not gonna believe what I 'm about to tell you . No , I 'm not . Now , where was I ?

Have I got something on my face , soldier ? You did . You did . Tomorrow , at the beach . Tomorrow , at the beach . We meet . You said to find you when I wake up . You do know what 's happening to me . Come with me . Now . You don 't talk to anyone about this but me . cause the best case scenario is you 're gonna end up in a psych ward . The worst case you 'll get dissected for study . Are we clear ? Yes ? Yes . First time you died , what happened ? You killed a Mimic ? Yes . Describe it . Uh ... it was different . It was a bigger . Blueish . And you got covered in its blood . As a matter of fact , I did . They know we 're coming . On the beach tomorrow . It 's a slaughter , isn 't it ? How do you know this ? Could you just ... Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Would you please just explain to me what the hell is happening ? What happened to you happened to me . I had it , I lost it . Okay ? I mean , that 's great , there 's a cure . How do I get rid of this ? First I need your help . Help with what exactly ? Winning the war . Let 's go , come on ! Rita , what is this ? Rita , what are you doing here ? You 've got to give me some warning . Who 's this ? He 's me , before Verdun . He 's gonna help us . What , you mean , he 's ... ? Yes . - When did he die ? Where ? - On the beach , tomorrow . How many fingers am I holding up behind my back ? How should I know that ? Okay . So this is the first time we 've had this conversation ? We should try this on him ? - What the hell is that ? - It doesn 't work . - Has he had any visions yet ? - Visions of what ? Okay , so there 's still time . - Yes . - Time ? Look , I ... I 'm sorry . What ... who is this ? Who are you ? I 'm Dr. Carter . Particle Physics Advanced Microbiology . He 's also the only other person who 'll believe what 's happening to you . No one understands Mimic biology , better than him . He 's a top analyst at the Whitehall . Ye ... well , I mean , I was until I met Rita and now I 'm just a ... a " mechanic with psychiatric delusions . " Carter , show him . Right , the first of all , you 're not fighting an army . You have to think of this as a single organism . Now these common drones , they act like its claws . That Alpha 's , like the one that you killed , are much more rare . Yeah , they 're like one in six point one eight million , by my guess . They act as the enemies ... They 're like its central nervous system But this ... is the brain . It controls them all . And this is the Omega . And the Omega has the ability to control time . Whenever an Alpha is killed , an automatic response is triggered . The Omega starts the day over again . but you see this time it can remember what 's going to happen , just like you do . It-it knows exactly what we 're going to do before we 're gonna do it . And an enemy that knows the future can 't lose . But if that 's true , how did you win in Verdun ? We were allowed to win . This thing wants us to believe we can win . It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion . Operation Downfall isn 't our end game . It 's the enemy 's . The thing you 've got to understand is this is a ... perfectly evolved world conquering organism . For all we know , there are thousands , millions , of those asteroids ... floating around the cosmos like a virus . And it 's just waiting to crash land into a world with just the right conditions . All they need is for the dominant life form to attack and ... And they 'll be nothing to stop the Mimics from conquering the rest of the world . Unless you change the outcome . Me ? When you killed that Alpha , you inadvertently entered the enemy 's nervous system . Cage . You 've seized control of the Omega 's ability to rest the day . How is that even possible ? Perhaps this organism 's only vulnerability ... its ... its only vulnerability ... is humanity . Regardless of that , you control the power now . Just as I did in Verdun . So I 'm resetting the day ? Okay . How do I control it ? You have to die . Every day . Until the Omega is destroyed . Fist of all , that was a terrific presentation . Terrific . I know the General . We should take this to him . You just tell him everything you told me , he would know ... I went to see the General , Cage . Many number of times . Psyche ward , dissection . Remember ? What are you expecting from me ? Have you seen anything strange ? Is he shitting me ? Visions . Visions ! Have you seen any visions like that ? The Omega centers when its losing control of its power . Even now its mentally searching to find you . When its close to finding you , you will start having visions . You 'll start to see that . You 'll even see where it is . And you had these visions ? Yes . But eventually you saw it , I mean , you actually saw it . Right ? Never in the flesh . So this is all just some ... theory ? You don 't know if this thing even exists . The visions showed me it was at Verdun . I could see it ! I ... I just ... lost the power before I could get to it . And by the time we took Verdun , the Omega was gone . Okay , so all I have to do is wait to have these visions , and then tell you where this Omega thing is ? No , Cage . You 're gonna get me there , and I 'm gonna kill it . Get you there ? I mean , I 'm not even trained for combat . Reload . Reload . You alright , Cage ? I think I broke something . What ? My back . The only thing I can feel are my lips . Now listen carefully . This is a very important rule . This is the only rule . You get injured on the field , you better make sure you die . Why ? Last time I was in combat , I was hit . I was bleeding out , just not fast enough . I woke up in a field hospital with three pints of someone else 's blood and I was out . I lost the power , do you understand ? Then you better start over , don 't you ? What ? No one knows what happened to Private Cage ? Skinner , you dumb ass , he was right next to you , you 're telling me you don 't know where that slippery son of a bitch went ? No , Serge ! Alright . - Let 's do another fifty , shall we ? - Oh , no ! And one ! No ! Wait , wait ! My name is Will Cage . I ... we met on the beach . We meet on the beach , tomorrow . I have what you had . Alright , let 's go again . You don 't have time to think . Remember , it 's now enough knowing where they 're going to be , you have to know how to kill them . That 's it ... hold on ! Hold on ! Listen ! Listen ! Okay , do it . On your feet , maggot ! Stop ! Wait , wait , wait , wait ! Stop ! Wait ! Wait a second ! Wait a second ! Wait a second ! You know , I 've been thinking . I mean , this thing 's in my blood . So maybe there 's some way I can transfer it to you . I 've tried everything , it doesn 't work . And have you ... You know ? Tried all ... all the options ? Oh , you mean sex ? Yep , tried it . How many times ? Alright . Left , left , left , left ! Keep your eyes open . Again ! Again ! Again ! Again ! Just wait , wait ! I think I 'm okay . On your feet , maggot ! Maggot ! Maggot ! Now , I 'm done being nice to you , maggot ! Now move ! You okay , Cage ? Oh , yeah ! Yeah , I 'm good ! I 'm good ! You 're leg 's broken . No ! I ... I can still feel my toes . Oh , come on ! Rita ! Rita ! What is this ? What are you doing here ? Look , who 's this guy ? - He 's me ... before Verdun . - ... before Verdun . What ... what do you mean ? He 's ... ? Yes ! Yes ! When did he die ? Where ? On the beach , tomorrow . I 'm Will Cage , you 're Dr. Carter . We 've had this conversation before . You have two fingers behind your back . I 've had the visions . I 've seen the Omega . It 's ... pretty much game over tomorrow , So can we move this along ? Okay . Where ? There 's a dam , it 's in the mountains . I saw German writing . Do you think you can work out where that is ? Well , I mean there can 't be too many places that fit that description . Do you think you can work out where that is ? Well , I mean there can 't be too many places that fit that description . I 'll see what I can do . Training 's over . I 'll see you tomorrow . - We don 't even know where we 're going . - We will , soon enough . In the mean time , you need to figure out a way to get us off that beach . What next ? Where are we going ? - Yeah ... - Which way ? Focus ! Which way ? I 'm thinking . I 'm thinking . Okay ... Oh , man ! How far do we make it ? Well , it 's ... hard to say . Hold ! Hold ! Okay , go ! Son of a bitch ! - I thought stepping left , ducking . - Fine . Just for the record , stepping left ... - Stepping left , ducking right . - It was pretty specific . Stepping left , ducking right . Move on . Hold on ! Now remember , across the trench , twelve o 'clock , then look to your right . - You 're not being specific , you understand ? - Oh , okay . You need to be specific , otherwise I 'm dead . Rita . Cage ! That takes us up to the top and then the trench . I 'm gonna step left , there 's gonna be a Mimic there which I 'll kill ... There 's an explosion , I 'm gonna run thirty paces to the north west . I 'm gonna duck at the top of that trench , and then I 'm gonna turn left . I got something on my face ? No ! Cage ! We 've been looking everywhere for you ! Cage ! Guys . Guys can we just ... not do this today ? What are you talking about ? Farell almost strung us up by our bullocks for losing track of you ! Okay , Skinner . Watch this . Now I 'm gonna close my eyes . - Ready ? - Yeah . I didn 't mind the extra push ups . It 's a new day , people ! Destiny calls . The world expects only one thing from us : That we will win ! The current situation on the front line show heavy casualties ... It 's about time we showed those things what we 're made of . My father flew in the battle of Britain , three years before the yanks came into the war . Couldn 't be broken , backbone . My Uncle George landed on the beach of Normandy , yeah . In their day , this war would have been over by now . What do they want with us anyway ? It 's obvious , isn 't it ? Minerals . Minerals ? - Yeah , minerals . - Oxygen , they want . Oxygen ? Think about it ... What difference does it make ? They 're here , they 're winning . And whatever it is , they 're gonna get it . Shouldn 't you be over there ? I 've been over there . More times than anybody . As a matter of fact , I 'm usually long dead by now . Coward . - What 's going on ? - The power 's gone . I found the Omega . I found it . It has to be here . Großer Dam , Germany . This as got to be it . It fits the description perfectly . Yes , you found it . Again . What difference does it make ? Cause we 're never gonna get there . No matter what we do , no matter how carefully we plan , we can 't get off that beach . You can do this . You can . You keep coming here everyday and I 'll train you . You already have . I 'm waiting , Nance ! Five hundred meters and closing fast ! What the ... ? ! Reloading . What 's next ? Straight shot . Up the hill . Okay . Hey , Serge . The new guy , ... what 's his name again ? We need a vehicle to get further inland . Then what 's the problem ? The problem is the ambush waiting for us down there , they kill before we find a working car . Okay , so what 's the current plan ? - The two cars I haven 't tried are the Minivan ... - Yep . - and the green SUV . - Okay . I 'll head for the SUV , draw the Mimics to me . You go for the Minivan . You get it started , just go , take off . - Do not wait for me . - Okay . Well ... just don 't forget to disconnect the caravan before you take off . You are going to be in a hurry , you don 't want any dead weight . Come on . Come on , Cage ! Can 't see ! Did you ... ? Stay where you are , remain calm . If you are in a vehicle , please lock the doors and stay inside . The enemy has reached London . Repeat . London is under attack . That 's good driving . I forgot to unhook the trailer . You don 't talk much . Not a fan . Of talking ? Not a fan of talking , no . You know , you eventually do talk to me . It 's usually around Lyon , you tell me about the time you went there with your family . Your brother got lost . I 've never been to Lyon . You tell me your middle name . Peyton . That 's not my middle name . You found your brother in the arcade , by the way . Well maybe I made it all up just to keep you quiet . But you do talk to me . Cage , I do not need to get to know you . And if you knew what was good for you , you wouldn 't want to get to know me either . It 's the only way you make it through this thing . What about Hendricks , you get to know him ? How do you know that name ? You mention him . That 's not possible . - Then how do I know his name ? - When did I mention him ? Under what circumstance ? Is he why you won 't talk to me ? Don 't ever mention his name again . Why ... - are you in love with him ? - He 's dead ! And I watched him die three hundred times , and I remember ... every detail , I remember everything . So I don 't need to talk about it . I 'm sorry . It 's just war . There 's nothing here , keep going . We have to find the keys . Let 's just siphon the gas . And why drive when we can fly ? In that thing ? Let me guess , you 're afraid of heights . I 'm afraid of crashing . I 'm not at all ashamed to admit it . You 'll be fine , Cage . You 'll learn . - What is it ? - It 's nothing , I 'm fine . - What is it ? - It 's nothing . Rita . Let me see . We have to find the keys to the helicopter . I 'm sure they 're around here somewhere . You know the heli 's full of fuel , I found a hose . We 're flying , Cage . Well , let 's just say we find keys , you know ? Get that helicopter started . We don 't have our jackets or ammunition . And it 's gonna be dark in a few hours . Might be better just going back to the farmhouse , seeing what we could salvage . You know , spend the night there . Come back here in the morning . And curl up by the fire and open a bottle of wine ? We should just reset . - It 's a dead end . - Hey , hold ... just ... If it 's all the same to you , I 'm tired , I 'm in pain . I 'd rather just start fresh . I 'll tell you what , take a few minutes . Coffee 's ready . I 'll look around for the keys , that 's productive . Ten minutes . Okay . And then I 'm killing you . Fine . I can 't believe you found coffee . Thank you . Oh . Sugar , right ? Yeah . Thank you . Hold on , three . You like three . There 's a shirt over there , it should be your size . How many times have we been here ? How many times ? Where are the keys ? - Where are the Goddamn keys ? - Okay . You can fly it , can 't you ? No . Well ... yes . I mean , I can take off , I 'm still working on my landing . What are we still doing here ? You 're wasting time ! Rita . You start that engine , you die ! This is as far as you go . No matter what I do . This is as far as you ever make it . There 's a Mimic buried twenty yards away . It attacks when you start the engine . Get your weapon and get in the helicopter , Cage . There 's more than a field battle there . Only one of us ever makes it . Get in . The only thing we haven 't tried is a version where you walk away , just go back to the farmhouse . There 's food , you wait there until I get back . You 'll be safe . I 'm a soldier , I volunteered . I 'm not walking away . You die here ! Right here ! I ... can 't save you . And if I go on and kill the Omega . You 're dead . Forever . Why does it matter what happens to me ? I wish I didn 't know you . But I do . My middle name ... is Rose . On your feet , maggot ! Looks there 's hope for your , Private . Hope in the form of glorious combat . Battle is the great redeemer . the fire and crucible in which the only true heroes are forged . The one place ... Yes ? Who said you could talk to me ? Do I have something on my face , soldier ? I 'm sorry to disturb you , Sergeant . Alright , man . Let 's get this show on the road . I gotta suite up . Where 's your helmet ? I 'm not gonna wear one . It 's a distraction . Have you been drinking ? I need three more clips of five-five-six , eight grenades and an extra battery . Get it ! Oy ! Oy , mate ! I think there 's something wrong with your suite ! There 's a dead guy in it . Yeah ! Wooh-hoo ! We made it ! Thank God , we made it ! Yeah ... ! Finish it ! It isn 't there . What do you mean the Omega isn 't there ? My guess is it never was . They knew we were coming . They ambushed us . The visions were a trap . Just like Rita 's visions were a trap at Verdun . It could have killed me , but it didn 't . It 's after my blood . So they know who you are , they ... They want their power back . And they 're gonna get it one way or another , unless we find the Omega . There ... there isn 't any other way , we 're finished ! No , we 're not finished . It doesn 't work . I can 't get it to work ... - You built a prototype at Whitehall . - Yes ! And I got fired for it , thank you very much . - What is this thing , anyway ? - It 's a transponder . You stick it into the Alpha and it taps into the wavelength connecting it to the Omega . That 's the idea anyway . But I can 't get it to work , not with the equipment I have on hand . How do we get you what you need ? Well , that 's the thing . I mean , ... when I was at Whitehall I built one , I was even ready to test it , but when I told my superiors about it , well I lost my job . They thought he was crazy . So all we need to do is go to Whitehall . He 'd be arrested ten feet from the front doors . Psyche ward dissection , remember ? Hey , hey , hey ! Aren 't you forgetting something ? The transponder requires a live Alpha to make it work . We don 't need one . We got the next best thing . When the Chinese delegation comes out , you pick up the pace . There 's a guy with a yellow arm band that always recognizes you . So just keep your head down and stay to my right . Nicely done . One . Two . Hold . Turn . Okay , keep walking . Just go straight ahead . Robinson I 've asked not to be disturbed . This had better be critical . Fate of mankind . Critical enough ? I don 't believe what I 'm seeing . I 've had more than my share of that . Sit down , General , and stay away from your desk . I 'd take her very seriously if I were you . I have to hand it to you , Major . when you left this office today , I never imagined you 'd be back , let alone with my most decorated soldier . I 'm here to tell you a story , General . and at first it 's gonna sound ridiculous , but the longer I talk the more rational , it 's going to appear . Tell him you 'll call back . Tell who ? Major General Beaumont calling from Halifax , His plane 's just been delayed . Bad weather . Yes ? Thank you , Beaumont . I 'll call you back . Tomorrow 's invasion is a slaughter . I 'm dead within five minutes of landing on that beach , along with every other soldier you are sending . And that 's because the enemy knows we 're coming . Now how do I know this ? Before I died I killed a Mimic , only this one was different . It passed something onto me in my blood . Now I relive the same day over and over again . Just like they do . Just like Sergeant Vrataski at Verdun . Tell your secretary everything 's fine . I beg your pardon ? Oh , I 'm sorry , General . I thought you were alone . It 's fine . She typed up those orders for you to authorize , but she left out the word eferring to the fuel duct in Greenwich . Your name is Iris . You 're birthday is September 17th . The General probably pulled some strings stationed your only son in Australia , as far from the war as possible . Tell the General his dinner 's been canceled , the call came in just now . Your dinner was canceled . You forgot the fuel duct . Thank you , Iris . That will be all . - Cage , Let 's go . - Rita . - Let me just ... - What are you doing ? Please , don 't shoot him yet . Okay ? Just ... General . Th ... this isn 't the first time we 've had this conversation . Cause that 's ... because you 're ... you 're stubborn . You won 't believe me when I tell you that Dr. Carter was right , That the enemy can manipulate time . The invasion will fail , no matter how many bodies you throw at it . And the only way to win this war , is by finding this power source within the cord and killing it . And the only means of finding it is in that safe right there . No matter how many times that we have this conversation , you refuse to accept that the enemy breaks through to London tomorrow , and we lose . We lose everything . Let 's say for the moment , that I can 't rationally explain ... your impressive parlor tricks . Dr. Carter told me ... this device requires a live Mimic to work . What use is it to you ? - That 's my concern . - On the contrary . According to you , this concerns the whole world . Well what would you do if you believed everything I just told you ? - I would locate this ... - Omega . And bomb it out of existence . You 're not mentally equipped to fight this thing , and you never will be . What do we do now ? I don 't know . We 've never gotten this far . That was easy . Stop ! Stop right there ! Don 't move ! Nobody move ! Drop it ! How am I supposed to do this ? Stick it in your leg ! Do it ! Cage , what happened ? Talk to me ! I feel it , it ... it 's taking me there . What do you see ? It 's ... it 's the Louvre . Where ? Where else ? I 'm inside now . It 's flooded . I 'm going down a garage , a garage underneath the museum . iThe Omega , do you see it ? It 's in Paris ! Rita ! What have you done ? What have you done ? You 'll be fine . You just needed blood . You don 't know what you 've just done . I 'm not allowed to talk to you . I was with someone . Rita Vrataski . Is she alive ? Rita Vrataski ? Please . Just tell me that . Please tell me . I 'm sorry . I was out of those things in three minutes flat , Cage . What 's wrong with you ? I thought you were dead . Not yet . I 'm sorry , Cage . No ! Wait , wait , wait ! I 'm out ! I 'm out ! They gave me blood ! I lost the power . I feel it . I can 't reset the day anymore . We have to kill the Omega , before the invasion starts . That gives us less than three hours . We need a drop ship to get to Paris in time . We need more soldiers too . No one 's crazy enough to follow us to Paris . Cage ! Cage ! Guys ! We 've been looking everywhere for you ! Just listen ... Farell almost strung us up by our bullocks for losing track of you ! Just listen . But you 're gonna want to hear this story . Now it 's gonna sound ridiculous at first , but the longer I talk the more rational it 's going to appear . Yeah ? ! He named the school I went to , and then he tells me my second grade teacher was called Miss Pollyhook . She wouldn 't let him go to the bathroom , made his wet his pants . Shut up ! Look , I 'm telling you , he know everything ... about all of us . Bullshit . Yeah ? He says your name ain 't really Ford . He says Ford was your friend , died in combat on his first day . You took his place , send your checks to his family . You slippery bitch . Cage says the enemy knows us too . They 're waiting for us on the beach , and we all die . The whole invasion is a slaughter . But it means coming with me , right now . Listen , pal . I don 't really care what you think you know about us . We just met you . Come on , why would we follow him into combat ? I don 't expect you to follow me . I expect you to follow her . That 's the full metal bi ... J Squad . This is Rita Vrataski . Otherwise known as ... Yeah , yeah . The Angel of Verdun . Okay . It 's a new day , people ! Destiny calls . The world expects only one thing from us : That we will win ! Rest assured they enemy will thank you for not giving a hundred percent today Squad ! Where 's J Squad ? Right , okay . So this Omega , it controls time ? Exploding it into pieces and sending its bullocks back to where it came from ! And then we go home ! Right , it 's guarded by an Alpha ... Just kill it , okay ? No ! You head what Cage said . Do not kill an Alpha . If we kill an Alpha , the Omega will reset this whole day . We 'll never even remember we had this conversation . They 're gonna know we 're coming . So what am I supposed to do if one of those Alpha 's is about to kill me ? Take a hit for the team . When we 're on the ground , there 's not gonna be much time before they know we 're there . We 're gonna need eyes up here . I 'm going in , Cage . Thirty seconds , still contact . Kimmel . No ! Ford ! Let 's go ! Cage ! We gotta go ! Drop ! Cage , they know we 're coming in ! Drop ! Drop ! Drop ! Drop ! You 're not hooked in ! What took you so long ? Where are the others ? Kita kehabisan amunisi . We 're low on ammo , I 've got one claymine . Ford , you 're out . Griff has only got half a magazine left and he can hardly move . I thought you could see the future ? I haven 't lived this day . I don 't know what 's gonna happen . It doesn 't matter . What matters is we finish this . With what ? I mean , Griff can 't even walk . We 're three men down . Come on ! Look , we 're running out of time . Collect your ammo . There must be a thousand Mimics between us and that pyramid . So what are we gonna do ? Just walk up to the front door , is that it ? If we stay here , we die . Yeah ? We 'll never get through . We could . In that . That ship will never fly . It doesn 't need to fly . It just needs to get us across there , with speed . If the engines are still running , we could steer with the power levers . Skinner . Clear a path . - Try it again now . - No , it 's not reading . Condition lever low . Electrical power on . Griff ! We gotta go ! Come on ! I 'm not gonna be any good in there , mate . Let me buy you some time . The power 's on . This is gonna work . Hey ! Hey , come on , man ! We gotta go ! Don 't wait for us ! Skinner , Griff , come on ! - We 're good to go , where are they ? - Where 's Skinner and Griff ? They 're not coming ! Go , brother . You gotta go , man . I 'll see you in the next life . Bullocks ! Move over ! Move over ! We gotta go ! No , we gotta go now ! They 're coming , Cage . Die you bastards ! Die ! Reload Reload Reload We 've got incoming ! Come on ! Cage ! You have to take over ! Rita ! Push it ! Push it ! We 've been through worse . Okay . It 's there . In the water , there . That 's an Alpha . I 'm gonna draw that thing away . You kill the Omega . No . You won 't make it ten feet before that thing kills you , Cage . I can do it . Take the grenades . I can do it . Listen to me . Listen to me . Neither one of us is getting out of here . Thank you . For getting me this far . You 're a good man , Cage . I wish I had the chance to know you better . Welcome to London , Major . I 'm Corporal Montgomery , the liaison to General Brigham 's press office . Very good to have you . Have you heard the news ? Just before sunrise this morning , a large surge of energy was detected in Paris . We do not know exactly what this signifies , but the result appears to be a total collapse of the enemy 's capacity to fight . Russian and Chinese troops are now moving across Europe . without resistance . Tomorrow we advance on the Western front . We believe we are marching to claim a victory for ourselves for our loved ones , for our countrymen , for the entire human race . What are you ? I 'm a warrior ! What do warriors do ? Kill ! What are you gonna do ? Kill ! You haven 't been in twenty battles , Ford . I have too ! You 're gonna dump your load the second we hit the beach tomorrow , Ford . How about you two get yourselves a nice hot cup of shut the hell up ? You funny , girl . But I bet you I set some kind of record tomorrow . Fastest time moving backwards for ... slipping in your own shit ! Who are you standing for ? A warrior ! What do warriors do ? Kill ! Attention ! Yes ? What do you want ? Sub : Khoibeo3g .

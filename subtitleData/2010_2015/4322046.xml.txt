 Previously on Warehouse 13 . Claudia Donovan , you 're the breach . Knock , knock . You 're going with Myka as a backup . My first official assignment as an agent ? Shut up ! As an apprentice . I 'm ready to begin my apprentice education . You want juice or are you a milk person ? You know what I 'd really like ? Oh , I do indeed , but falling off the wagon may not be the best option at this point . No , no , what ? We 're just asking because we 're worried about you . I 'm not drinking . How do we not end up with our brains scrambled or blown up or whatever new way to die there could be ? Well , I mean , look at the bright side , I 'm usually within 10 feet of you , so whatever terrible thing happens to you will probably happen to me , too . Comforting . What is this guy , a jewel thief or a marathoner ? If the artifact let the thief walk into a jewelry store and vanish , then why isn 't he vanishing now ? Well , maybe he can 't activate it on the run ? Or maybe it doesn 't do what Artie thinks it does . That 's Kelly . I told her I 'd call to discuss the weekend and I totally forgot . Whoa ! Hello . Ah ! Careful ! Just don 't damage the one thing that Kelly 's looking forward to . Nah , Little Pete 's made of steel . You go right , I 'll go left . Leena , this one is ready to be shelved . That tin of sardines ? Yes . It was part of the Shackleton expedition . They were trapped on the ice , you know , for two years . And they still had the good sense not to open that . Had the sardines gone bad ? Very bad . Artie , I just found an anomaly . Survey says that insurance V. P. S in Hartford are donating big bucks to charity and it doesn 't compute . It 's not an anomaly . It 's a tax write-off . Yeah , but these guys gave away 50 % of their bank accounts . I mean , the most they donated before was 1 % , but that 's a difference of 49 ... I can subtract one from 50 . That 's why you 're the boss . Hartford . Artie , Artie , that could be a Robin Hood artifact . Yes , it could . And the prize for finding a case is a spin around the Warehouse on Steve McQueen 's motorbike ? No . But try a free trip to Hartford because Pete and Myka are on the trail of a vanishing jewel thief in Denver . So , you and I will do this investigation . You and I ? Really ? Yeah . Well , I mean , I haven 't had a lot of time in the field , and you 're ... I 'm what ? Nothing . That was the end of my sentence . Pack because we 're leaving right away . Where are my sunglasses ? This is why I pimped your specs . Just tap the ends of the glasses together to complete the circuit . Brava . That is very well done . Well , we 're a team . Claudia and Artie . Clartie . Artia ? Pack . Yeah . Pete ! I got the bag ! You get him ! Secret Service ! What happened ? Asian guy . Went out that window ! What is with this guy and windows ? Hey , are you all right ? Hey , Pete , this way ! Got it covered . Whoa ! Oh ! Ow . Oh . Ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow , ow . Further than I thought . We lost him . Ah , what ? But we got the artifact . Well , let 's take a look at it then . Jeez , where 's the drummer and fife ? I just hurt my knee , okay ? And my shoulder . I 'm probably going to have a huge bruise on my ... What is that ? That is the world 's smallest purple violin . You know , one day you 're going to make some lucky guy a very sarcastic wife . Huh . Half lion , half eagle . A griffin . I know . Well , did you know that in Chinese mythology they were used to guard treasure ? But somehow this one helps people steal treasure and then make a clean getaway . Oh , hey , speaking of , now that the mission is accomplished , you can go to your high school reunion . See some of your old friends . You did have friends in high school , right ? As a matter of fact Kurt Smoller , who is the captain of the football team , emailed me and invited me personally . Wow . You and a football captain , huh ? Yeah . Yeah . We hung out . Okay , I tutored him in math . Well , that 's perfect . Now you can go back and show big , fat Kurt Smoller that smart girls grow up pretty . Fine ! I will go . Excellent . Oh . Well , let 's bag old Kathy Griffin there , shall we ? Ready ? Yep . Nothing to it . And now , for two days , we get to pretend we 're normal . Leena ? Leena ? Pete ! I have a good name . Hey , Leena . Hey , Pete . Wow . I didn 't know the Warehouse had a canned food aisle . Ooh , red herrings , huh ? Oh , I bet that case was really hard to solve . Did you hurt your leg ? I did . I twisted it nabbing the griffin , which I put on Artie 's desk . I didn 't see him or Claudia . They 're in Hartford on a mission . Pete , put that back ! That 's the original can of worms . All right . Well , 3 : 00 on a Friday , so I am calling it . I will see you on Monday . Take care of that leg . And you should stay in bed all weekend . My plan exactly . Ah ! Ow , ow . I think that the donation is suspicious . That 's all . I 've done nothing wrong . I gave money to fund free clinics across the country . That 's a good thing . No , no , it 's a good thing if you did it of your own free will . But I get a feeling that your wife wasn 't too thrilled with that decision . What makes you think that ? Okay , she was upset with my sudden generosity but that 's because she didn 't understand why I did it . And why did you do it ? I don 't have to answer to you . Or my wife . Is there another woman ? No . There 's only one woman for me . Okay . Claudia , I think that we could be dealing with a home wrecking artifact . Two of the V.P. S have filed for divorce . Oh , make that three . V.P. Of Product Operations just called off his engagement . You got that off the internet ? Mmm , social networking , but old school . Teri , the receptionist is chatty . So , aside from these donations , what else do these Truehart executives have in common ? Ooh , one thing . I cross-checked their recent credit card charges , Hansen 's Bar showed up on all three expense accounts . Can you pull up the receipts ? Observe . Well , each of these guys met with the same person . You know that how ? Because look , on each receipt , apple mojito . Are any of these Truehart executives not affected ? John Donley . Oh , wait . Oh ! Pickles , that was just him with Teri . We should go warn him . No , no , no . We should track him , because he could be the mojito drinker . See if you can hack into the garage cameras and then follow ... Hey , Teri , John say where he was headed ? Hansen 's Bar for a drink with a client . You should try it . They have the best happy hour clam bar . Do you feel like clams ? I feel a little clammy , yeah . Oh , yeah . Okay . Let me just say T.G.I.F. Sorry about the knee . Kind of limits my moves a little . No complaints , unless you were faking it so I had to do most of the work . Why ... Why don 't women ever believe me ? Let 's not get into that . Don 't worry . We won 't go dancing tonight . Good . Because there 's nothing I want that isn 't right here in this bed . Megan ? Wait , let me guess . I have no idea . Myka Bering . Myka . Great . Okay . So tonight 's cocktail party plus a room is 120 , unless of course you plan to hook up with someone and don 't need the room . I 'll take the room . So , is Kurt Smoller here yet ? Right over there . Isn 't it disgusting ? He 's in better shape and has more hair than he did in high school . Yeah . Oh , come on . Give us a smile . Just take the picture . There 's the apple mojito . We 're dealing with a femme fatale . I thought you were interested in group insurance , Miss Andrews . And if you 're buying , I 'm selling . But if you 're selling , I 'm not buying . You haven 't heard the whole pitch . I 've heard enough . I 'm a happily married man . And John 's reaching for his briefcase . Now he 's walking out . Okay , I 'm going to follow him . You stay here . Flag on the play . Now he 's heading back to her . You fascinate me . Excuse me , could I get another vodka tonic , please ? Vodka tonic ? That 's a grown up drink . Kurt . Myka Bering ? The algebra girl ? Yeah . I 'm glad you could make it . Really ? Well , you know , I mostly came because of that nice email that you sent me . Oh , yeah . Megan sent those out . We 're co-chairs . Ah . So , you two still a couple ? No . Not since senior prom . I think once you see somebody vomit that much for that long , it changes everything . Well , maybe we should catch up some time . Yeah , well , do you want to join us for a drink ? I mean , you remember the guys ? Royboy and Gabers and Phil ? Yeah , I ... I remember them . Maybe later ? Maybe later . Okay , what the hell ? Well , she must be using some kind of seduction artifact . There 's so many that it could be . Valentino 's cigarette , Helen of Troy 's cuff bracelet , you know . JFK had a ... He had a tie pin that drove women ... What the hell are you doing ? I 'm setting an alarm in case there 's any activity in John 's bank account . Very good idea . Whoa . You 've still got some kick in you , huh ? What was that about ? So , are you sure you don 't want a bowl of cereal ? Mmm-mmm . Just another bowl of you . Hey , I 'll have another one . Oh . Hello , is this Pete ? Whoa . I 'm not sure . I mean , is this Myka ? I don 't know . I look like Pete but I don 't feel like Pete . You feel like me . Right ? I mean , like Myka . Pete , what the hell happened ? Uh , jeez , I don 't know . I would say we switched bodies . Pete ? Am I you ? Oh , yeah . We definitely switched bodies . Pete , get your hands off my breasts . Myka , how did you know that ? Because you 're still you and I 'm still me even though we 're in different bodies . Okay , we got to figure ... Ow ! Myka , what is it ? You really did hurt your knee . Okay , this body whammy is definitely artifact related . I mean , I saw a flash of the griffin . Me too , Pete . Okay , now we 've got to get back to the Warehouse . Here 's your drink , miss . Hold on . Hey , pal , how many of those have I had ? This will be four . Holy crap . Myka , listen , I drank three ... I drank three vodka tonics . No , no , no , Pete , I drank three vodka tonics . Okay , so you feel my knee pain and I feel your booze buzz . Oh , my God , Pete , I am so sorry . I would have had juice if I 'd have known we were going to switch bodies . This is going to be tough to explain at my next A.A. Meeting . Promise me you won 't drink any more . Don 't worry . I remember this feeling and it doesn 't end well . And don 't drive , okay ? You 're a bad enough driver already . I 'll come get you . It 's not that far . Who 's on the phone ? Pete . Hey , is that Kelly ? Myka . I mean , it 's my partner , Myka . It 's a girl . Myka , hi , yes , I will go to the office to pick up the file . I 'll be there in about three hours . Okay ? And in the meantime , don 't do anything that I wouldn 't do , and I mean that . Hey , the same goes for you . Kelly , I got to go . Now ? But we were going to spend the whole weekend together . I know , but I 'm ... You know , the IRS never sleeps so ... I 'll be back as soon as I can . May I remind you that you still owe me one . Why don 't we even out the score before you leave ? Oh , gosh , no , no . No . I 'm sorry . I wish I could , sweetie ... pie . Cake . But I just wouldn 't be able to concentrate . Oh . Okay . Fine . Go . Sorry . I 'll call you from the road . And it 's not like I 'm a guy saying I 'll call you . I mean it . Okay . Oh , my God . I have got to put a shirt on . Bye . What have I said about the Rockies all season ? It all comes down to ... Pitching . Yeah , runs don 't matter . The Rocks can 't win without the bullpen . Exactly what I was going to say . Mmm-hmm . Let me get you a chair . Hey , hey , hey , too slow . Anyway , with De La Rosa and Jimenez , you have strength ... Strength on the mound , but depth ? Man , I don 't think so . Clearly she knows more than you guys . Ooh , anyone want hot wings ? Hey , Sam , wing us . Did it go through ? It 's done . Well , lookie that . He just marked a $ 3 million chunk of bonds to sell when the market opens . She 's sending him away . Why would she do that ? Because she got what she wanted . I 'm going in . But first , precautions . To neutralize that tainted cigarette smoke . This should block any pheromone-related or perfume-borne substances . And just to be safe , these are in-ear noise cancellers that will avoid any kind of siren-related artifacts . That should be that . Cover me . Pardon me , miss . I 'm a federal agent . And I know that you somehow forced executives from Truehart to donate to free clinics , and before you deny it , we just traced some activity on John Donley 's bank account . That 's some pick up line . Something has entered your life that 's giving you power over men . I know that , and I want to know what that thing is because you 've been abusing that power , haven 't you ? I 'm not the bad guy here . In fact , once you get to know me , I 'm actually quite nice . Oh , your charms aren 't going to work on me , lady . Sorry . You sure you don 't see something you like ? No . I 'm here on business . It 's time you start answering my questions . It 's done . That 's why you 're the master . Did you get the artifact ? No , no , she 's clean . Let 's go . Hold on . So , Artie , what 's our next move ? Who 's our next suspect ? I told you , the investigation is over . Those men gave their fortunes away . For a good cause . You stay away from her . What ? She 's mine ! Artie ! Back off , Donley ! She loves me now ! What ? Artie ! I am going to Tesla him until he is impotent ! Artie , stop . She 's gotten to you . Give ... Just stay out of this . I 'm taking you down ! Guys ... Claudia , get out of my way ! Hey , that 's her car . Lauren ! Lauren ! Wait for me ! Lauren ! Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Call 911 . Oh , my God , she should be more careful . She could get hurt . Seriously though , you actually like the Three Stooges ? Yeah . Who 's your favorite Joe ? I would have to go with Besser over DeRita . Although nobody could hold a candle to Curly . " Nyuk , nyuk , nyuk . A wiseguy , eh ? " " Ruff , ruff , ruff , ruff . " Okay , don 't take this the wrong way , but until tonight , I had no idea you were so much fun . Dude , until tonight , I wasn 't that much fun . Okay , there 's something special happening here , right ? You feel this ? You don 't know the half of it . Dude , what the hell ? I thought you wanted me to . No ! Jeez ! Crap . I 'm a chick . Pete ! I got to go . Okay . Okay . Pete , Pete , Pete ! Just let me do it . Jeez , I haven 't had a drink in eight years . The buzz lasts a little bit longer than I remember . Oh , is that why you kissed my high school crush ? Ow ! I didn 't kiss him . He kissed me . Wait , Kurt likes me ? No , he likes me . He thinks you are a giganto nerd . Right . We 'll fix this . Well , me first . I got to take a leak . Don 't forget to sit down . And don 't touch anything . Dark , reeling feeling . Artie , I just found something huge . What rhymes with adorable ? Deplorable ? No . No . More able ... More able to impassionate . Stop writing poetry ! No , I can 't stop . Hey , I need your brain . I just found out Lauren 's brother died six months ago of liver disease . His request for a transplant was denied by his insurance . You want to guess who the provider was ? Truehart . So it 's a revenge thing . And who can blame her ? We can . No . Apparently , the money 's not enough . She wants their lives . Well , you know , when I see her , I 'll ask her to stop wanting their lives and she 'll do it because she 's sweet . Holy gams , Batman , that 's how she 's doing it . Rangel ? Pangel ? Artie , look at this . You touched Lauren 's leg . John Donley touched it , too . I think adorable is better . Don 't show me another man groping my Lauren . Oh , that man 's in the hospital with five broken ribs and you could be next . Oh . What can you tell me about Lauren 's leg ? That the only thing that stops it going on forever is the floor . Silky smooth , and subtly soft . Ooh , I like subtly soft . That 's it . Silky smooth . Oh , so maybe it 's a body cream that she 's using to turn men into stalkers . Stalker ? No . Would a stalker go to her house in the middle of the night to read her poetry ? Oh , Artie , you can 't go over there without a shower . You 're all stinky from artifact hunting . Oh , yes , it has been a long day . Gamey , right ? Shower , yeah . But not a cold one . I ... Well , Leena 's looking into it , but what do we do in the meantime ? Let 's go over the griffin . There could be something . All right . Just ... A metal flap . That 's it . Is it ? Yes , yes , it means it 's a bookend and not a statue . And bookends come in pairs . And if there 's another one , the thief probably has it . He could be anywhere by now . No , wait , Leena said that when she put the griffin down , it rotated . It looks like it 's pointing , like a compass . Maybe it 'll lead us to its mate in some dualistic attraction . Come on , let 's hit the road . Oh , and could you change out of my dress ? I just bought that today . Jeez . That 's Kelly . Oh , shoot . I said I 'd call her . Uh-huh . So it 's not just a guy thing . Hi , Kelly . It 's me , Pete . Hey , you know , I know that I said that I 'd call you , but I forgot and so I want to make it up to you with this promise ... No ! What ? No promises ! No , Myka ! Myka ! No promises ! Uh , yes , let me ... Let me get someplace private . Fresh as a daisy , and a little less formal and slightly slimming . And all you need is your hat . Ooh , what a good idea . All right ... What are you doing ? No . Claudia ! Knock , knock . Just like old times . Claudia ! It 's for your own protection , Artie . I 'm going to Lauren 's to do what Warehouse agents do , get the artifact . If you hurt Lauren , I will hunt you down . Mmm-hmm . Pwned . God , how can you stand this hair ? I just want to cut it off . You do that and I will shave your entire body . Use the hair tie . It 's on my right arm . So , I just thought it was an ugly bracelet . So , what do I do ? Turn . So what did you promise Kelly ? Well , you will find out . Oh , my God , your hands are so clumsy . Ow ! There . Look at that . What is it doing ? Hey ! You have the other griffin . You were right . There are two of them . Security guard , you and the thief were working together . Wrong again . We are together . And we 've been looking all over town for you . I really don 't like where this is going . I need the other griffin now ! No ! First you show up ... There 's no time ! Myka , grab the griffin ! Whoa . I 'm me again . Myka , where are you ? I 'm back to myself . This just got easier . Wrong . He 's the nice one . So am I. Now we 're sharing one body , too . Pete ? Pete , we have got to fix this . Yeah , tell me about it . Oh , hi . I work with Artie . Get out of here . No can do . Two men are in the hospital and you 're still on the loose . That wasn 't my fault . I saw you hit John Donley with your car . That wasn 't me driving . Then who was it ? Me . I told you to get out of here . Sharing the same body now . Great . Should make Myka do this . Really ? Just when I could used the upper body strength . Okay . Hey , you 're still up . Kurt . This is a really bad time for a booty call . What makes you think it 's a booty call ? Well , what else would it be ? Busted . Can I come in ? No . No , you can 't . And just believe me when I say it 's not you , it 's me . Myka , I promise I just want to talk . The lady said good night . Wait , Myka didn 't tell me she was involved . You went for it , man . That 's cool . Now get lost . Look , man , you really don 't have to do this . I 'm not after you . I 'm not taking any chances until Lauren and I are on that plane . What plane ? The one that 's taking us far away , my love . I don 't want to go anywhere with you , Howard . You do . You 're just distracted by all these people . Is that why you handcuffed me ? I won 't allow any of these other men to steal you away . I 'm going to go pack your bags and then we 'll get out of here . I am so sorry . I had no idea these guys would turn violent . Yeah , well , just let me think about this for a minute . If Artie is a federal agent , won 't he come after you ? He would , except I kind of handcuffed him in his hotel room . Fastest working karma ever . Karma . Yeah , that 's how this whole thing got started . I wanted that insurance company to pay back to others what they took from me . I never wanted anyone hurt . So how are you doing it ? It 's something to do with your legs , right ? Stockings . I don 't know why or how they work , but when men touch them , they 'll do anything I ask . Which is cool . You know , until they become obsessed stalkers and you can 't control them . Where are the stockings now ? On a rod in the bathroom . Oh , right . Like I don 't know how to improvise an electromagnet . I was doing this when MacGyver was still trapped in his crib . Yeah , come to papa . Oh ! Oh , yes . Oh , yes , yes . Come , baby , come , come , come . Yeah . Okay . Okay . And this is only one of 23 ways that I could have escaped . Oh , I don 't feel so good . We can help . Just tell us what to ... The griffins . I got them . They 're right here . Quick . This is bad . Just tell us what to do . You ... Just ... Oh ! Oh . I sure wish he 'd ... Finished that sentence . All set . By this time tomorrow , we 'll be relaxing in a villa near Lisboa . And as for you ... Lauren , come on . Say something . Howard , don 't hurt her . I have no choice . She would get between us and I can 't allow anything to come between us . You ? You . Lauren , are you all right ? Yes , but what did you do to him ? Temporary blindness . This is a shard from the lens of the Pharos Lighthouse , Alexandria , and there 's a Phoenix . Oh , so many things that I could show you . Artie , thank God . He was about to shoot me . Claudia , the prism was meant for you . She thought that she could outsmart me but I 've got moves she 's never even dreamt of . We 're out of here . No . No . First , unlock Claudia . Unlock the girl that tried to come between us ? Never . Let 's go . Leena , you 're our last hope . We just learned the hard way that two things can 't occupy the same space . Okay . I looked into split personalities which led me to Robert Louis Stevenson who wrote Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . Going through his notes , I found a picture of him in his study ... Can we move this along ? I 'm starting to get a really ... Bad vibe . So that 's what vibes feel like . Huh . On the shelf behind him there 's two bookends . Griffins ? No . One is an eagle and the other is a lion . It seemed like such a coincidence ... Maybe the bookends on the mantel are in an inactive state . What if the heads can be switched and the duality ... Can be reversed . We need to make the eagle and the lion whole again . I 'll call you back . Okay . It worked . All right , come on , birdie . You 'll have to kill me . Nothing but a bullet will stop me from trying to be with Lauren . Artie , don 't . Lauren , go get the stockings . Now ! I know exactly how you feel , Howard . Then you know I 'll follow her to the ends of the earth . As would I. Get on your knees , I 'll make it quick . Artie , stop this ! You 're not a cold-blooded killer ! Lauren ! Little birdie . Got it . Well , yeah , that 's because I loosened it for you . Put the eagle head on the eagle . Okay . Just get it over with . What do I do with them ? Put a run in them . Use your nails , anything . And the lion head on the ... Oh , my God . Howard , are you okay ? I 'm not sure . My eyes hurt . Ow . Oh , my God , I 've got to get home to my wife . That was too close . In so many ways . So , I guess we can 't even pretend to be normal , huh ? Normal . Not really in our wheelhouse . Good job . Hey , look , I found the artifact . Where did you get those ? My great grandfather 's estate . More details . You turned several of us into blabbering fools , I 'd like to know how . Who was your great grandfather ? He was a diplomat during World War I. They were in a box with a card . " Souviens-toi de moi , mon amour " " Souviens-toi ... " " Remember me , my love . " World War I ? Yeah . The card , was it signed Margaretha ? Yes . How did you know that ? Margaretha Zelle , otherwise known as Mata Hari . The spy ? And a world-class seductress . There 's no way to tell whether they worked on her or she worked on them . Either way , they worked . I need to call the hospital , find out if John Donley 's okay . I hope he doesn 't have his company 's insurance . And Clartie saves the day . Kiddo , I want to thank you for focusing on your job and trying to protect me . Well , I learned from the master . You know the keys are over there . From here I can count eight ways that you can escape . Okay , look , I 'm really sorry ... Oh , a spatula , make that nine . Claudia . " Knock , knock . " Open . Then the thief walks into the jewelry store , right ? Asks the clerk to see something pricey . The clerk turns around , poof , he turns into the other one . I got to say it 's a pretty cool plan . Yeah , until they exploded , it was perfect . Now the griffins are back in their dormant state . Yes . The eagle and the lion . And the Myka and Pete . What ? Hey , I ... I 'll be right back . What ? Hey . Hey , where 's your boyfriend ? Oh , I don 't have one . All right , obviously you 're seeing someone . You know what , Kurt , nothing , nothing is really obvious about me . And I just ... I wanted to tell you that ... I 'm not who I seemed to be before . Okay , well , whoever that was , she was a lot of fun . Well , I really enjoyed talking to you , too . Do you want to have ... Do you want to keep in touch ? Definitely . Would it be okay if I kissed you goodbye ? So okay . You know what ? I just really have to ask you , which kiss was better , this one or the one before ? Ah , honestly ? Yeah . This one . The one before , you burped in the middle of it . Bye , Kurt . I 'll email you . Ta-da ! Rose petals ? And candles . And balloons . And chocolates . As promised . Who needs candy ? I want you . So , everything 's okay between us ? Are you kidding ? What you said on the phone is the sweetest thing a guy has ever said to me . I bet you don 't even remember the exact words . Oh , I remember . No man has ever understood me like that . I 'm so glad that ... That you 're you . Me , too . But , but , but , you know what would be really fun ? Oh ! Yeah . Why don 't you say back to me what I said on the phone and then I 'll grade you for accuracy ? Or not .

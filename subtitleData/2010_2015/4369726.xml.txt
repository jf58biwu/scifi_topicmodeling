 - Who 's this ? - Another Olivia Dunham . Previously on Fringe : They 've done experiments on me . - Dunham escaped from Liberty Island . - Olivia 's in trouble . I 'm not sitting here . - Hey , Liv . Thank God we found you . - I am not who you think I am . Mom ? I 'm not your daughter . My mother died when I was 14 years old . - You are . You 're confused . - This was going to be my way home . - This is your home . - I 've never been here . If you 've never been here , how did you know to come here ? Why convince her she 's our Olivia Dunham ? You 'll know soon enough . - You all right ? - Is he all right ? Welcome back , Agent Dunham . You do remember me , right ? Yeah . You 're that tightwad that owes me $ 70 . Damn it . I was hoping you 'd forget about that . - It 's good to see you . - You too . No worse for the wear . Look like you got some rest . A continuous IV drip of government-issue antipsychotics . - It 's like instant R and R. - Sounds like fun . Maybe I should , uh , dive off the deep end . You think anyone would notice a difference ? You know what I realized this minute ? That I didn 't miss you at all . Not even an itty-little bit . - You were lost without me , admit it . - Yeah , yeah . How does she seem ? She seems like Olivia Dunham . For all intents and purposes , she is Agent Dunham . She 's internalized her traits , her memories , her knowledge . When tested , she consistently responds as our Agent Dunham would under similar circumstances . And what about our Agent Dunham ? Has she made contact ? She 's on the other side focused on the task at hand . Permission to speak , Mr. Secretary . Go ahead . Putting an impostor on my team is too big a risk . You can run all the tests you want . You don 't know how this Olivia will respond in the field . We have no other choice . She needs to be completely immersed in Agent Dunham 's life . Over time , she will reach a plateau , and her new identity will become fixed . How much time ? I 'm not willing to lose one of my legitimate agents . - You don 't know what we have to gain . - Which is what exactly ? Sit down . She can move between worlds . We have discovered some ways to cross over but each comes with their own dangerous consequences . But she she can cross without harm . Science Division is working up a series of experiments . We need her to submit willingly which she 'll only do if she believes that she belongs here . Phillip , if we can learn what she already knows ... We can begin to defend ourselves . And what if her new identity doesn 't hold ? Then she 'll no longer be necessary . - Keep me apprised . - Yes , sir . Yesterday a Liberty Metro bus ran a red light , killing a person . This morning , same thing happened again . Two mornings in a row , two buses , killed two people . Lookers ran the probabilities , and it 's a statistical anomaly ... What happened at yesterday 's crash ? Police considered it a routine accident , so we have no more information . - You mind taking over ? - Sure . Okay , the first victim 's name is Cole Arnett , 43 years old . He was on his way to his job . He was a hospital case worker . Must have been his unlucky day . All right , we 're coming in . Oxygen , people . - Air quality normal . No oxygen needed . - Okay , listen up . Agent Lee will be meeting us on the site . He 'll be calling the shots . Agent Francis . Watch the time , Agent Lee . We need you back in that chamber in eight hours or your burns will regress . - You can kiss that healing goodbye . - Easy come , easy go . - Oh , you think you 're amusing ? - I am amusing . - God , I missed this . - I bet . - Did Broyles download you yet ? - I talked to him on the way over . - Need a victim ID . - I 'll see what I can do . - Where 's my ... ? - Field kit ? Here . - You look better . - And you look sane . You doing all right ? So far . I mean , it 's my first day back , so ... You wanna move that vehicle ? When I pulled that gun , I didn 't know what I was doing . - lf something had happened ... - But nothing happened . You and I , we 're good . - Yeah ? - Yeah . Died on impact . No attempts to revive her were made . Obviously . - Still have any fingerprints ? - Right hand 's probably your best bet . Her name 's Jillian Foster , 32 , lives right here in Hoboken . Anything else ? She liked daisies . I never hit a person before . Never . I mean , once I hit a pigeon . I felt horrible for weeks . No sign of environmental degradation . Molecular cohesion is intact . So why is this a Fringe case ? I don 't think there 's video at this point . All right . Oh , yeah , yeah , we 're done . Thanks . - You got something ? - When 's the last time you saw one of these ? God , a pen ? I don 't know . Preschool maybe ? I didn 't know they still made these . It 's new . No dents , no scratches . - Where 'd you find it ? - By the mailbox . That 's where the messenger swerved so he wouldn 't hit some old guy that was bending down . Huh . Oh , you wanna share , buddy or we 'll just stand here and watch you think ? All right . It 's pretty rare finding one of these just lying around . Maybe the old guy bent down to pick it up and caused the messenger to swerve . - Causing him to hit the stand . - Like the pen started some kind of chain reaction . - You find something ? - What is it ? - Sorry , I thought I recognized someone . - You okay ? Yeah . All right , so Fringe event or not ? Not sure yet . Something weird definitely happened here . Yeah . Hello ? Hey , babe . - You didn 't have to do that . - Well ... - Come here . - Ha , ha . Thank you . Hmm ... So how was it ? - Yeah , it was ... It was pretty good . - Yeah ? What 's happening in Texas ? I heard it 's bad . - Twenty-two smallpox cases so far . - Has Atlanta called ? - No , no one 's assigned me yet . - Ugh ... Why are we talking about this ? Because you 're a virologist and smallpox is your area of expertise . May as well start packing . No , I mean why are we talking about me ? How was it being back at work ? What 's wrong ? Something happen ? Well , at first it was normal , and then we 're out in the field and I saw a face . - A face ? - Hmm ... Was it someone you know ? You remember the secretary 's son ? The one who was kidnapped when he was a boy ? - Mm-hm . Well , him . But it wasn 't really him . It was like I was hallucinating or something . - Did you tell Broyles ? - No . Maybe you shouldn 't be on field duty . Yeah , I wanna be there . I know , but you have to tell someone . A doctor , at least . - I need my life back , Frank . - And I love your gung-ho attitude . But , honey , you just got over a breakdown . If you need help , that 's fine . Frank , it was my first day back . I was nervous . - I don 't think it 's surprising that there 's ... - I can take myself off call . - Maybe it 's not a good time to travel . - That 's not what I want . Are those avocados ? Where did you get them ? - How much ? - Don 't worry about that . - What if it happens again ? - It won 't . If it does , you 'll tell Broyles , right ? Because I love you . - I 'll tell him . - Thank you . - Can we eat ? - Yes , we can eat . - Okay . - Okay . All right , help me out here . The first bus driver was distracted by tree trimmers . The second bus driver was looking at a fight over oranges . Isn 't distraction the root of every accident ? Well , uh , listen , I 'm not finding any connections in these victims ' bios either . First guy , Arnett , worked at a hospital for the past 15 years . Second victim , Miss Foster landed her position at Gregston Electric a year ago . Maybe they knew someone in common . Maybe despite what Farnsworth said , it 's just two freak accidents . You know , Liv thinks I 'm right about there being chain reactions that led up to the crashes . Okay , well , now that you two have rediscovered your Vulcan mind-meld you think she 's doing okay ? - Yeah . - Why , you don 't think so ? - I don 't know . I just feel a little uncomfortable . Not a shock . You let a doppelg√§nger coldcock you . You didn 't pick up that she wasn 't your partner . And you would have ? - I just know Liv a little better , that 's all . - Right . Because you kissed her one time . - How was I to know she had a boyfriend ? - Okay . - Whatever . Point is , I would 've known . - Yeah , keep telling yourself that , okay ? When she was having her breakdown she kept on and on about how they were trying to make her believe she was somebody else , that this wasn 't her life . This is gonna sound nuts . What if she 's telling the truth ? What if it 's not the real her ? That is nuts . You 're right . All right . For the record , you could not tell those two apart . Look at this . Over there on the ground , lower corner . - That 's another ballpoint pen . - Get Liv , tell her we got something . - Somebody 's causing these accidents . - How is that possible ? What would be the odds ? Zero-point-zero-zero-zero . Impossible . - Astrid , we see impossible every day . - You see improbable . You 're asking me if it is possible for a person to use a pen to set off a chain of events that culminates in someone getting killed by a bus twice ? - Exactly . - There 's no way . Given how few ballpoint pens are out there finding one at both crime scenes , I mean , that 's an anomaly . - You said that yourself . - What if someone calculated variables ? Thirty-seven people in the intersection , 22 cars , four trucks , two buses wind speeds of 10 miles an hour , and that is just a start . We are talking 120 variables in a dynamic system of differential equations . I can 't solve that , much less manipulate the outcome to my advantage . So there 's not even the slightest chance ? Dude , seriously , what part of 0.000 don 't you get ? - What is it ? - It happened again . What did ? Bus accident , East 85th and York . - You called the ambulance ? - On the way . Sir , we 're gonna get you to the hospital . Be careful with that vehicle . It 's still smoking . - Where were you sitting on the bus ? - Right in the front . - Did you happen to notice a pen ? - What ? A pen . A ballpoint pen . You use it to write with ? Looks like there was some sort of commotion . Dog ran into the street , distracted the bus driver . No way this is another coincidence . Except this time it didn 't work . He 's gonna make it . Oh , ma 'am , you need to stay still . It 's not over . They 're all ready to go . They 're all taken . He 's still here ! Stop . Don 't move . Take your hands out of your pockets . Come on , let 's go . Get out of here . Put your hands on your head . Give Astrid his description , run it through the database . I did . She 's already working on it . - Okay , you gotta get back in that pod . - It 's just the two-minute warning . Agent Lee , what part of " be back in eight hours " didn 't you understand ? I still can 't believe he knew the bike would cause the truck to slow down and swerve under the bridge . He didn 't even look . How did he know when to jump ? We should stop focusing on how and focus on why . - Why is he targeting these people ? - I 'm working on that . The victims must have something in common . - There 's gotta be a connection . - Oh , God . Okay , Lincoln , you gotta get in there . Crosscheck their medical files , criminal records , job histories , tax histories . - Shut up , okay ? I got it . - Someone 's gotten bossy . Where have you been ? They 've been calling all day . - What did you tell them ? - Nothing . You have to call them back . Each liquefied thing provides an instance of a property of being liquid . Mass is equal passing through a liquid and mass is the same . - lf you don 't call them , I will . - But you won 't . You see , your only action will be inaction . - That 's your pattern . - What ? Ninety-seven percent of your actions prioritize relational bonds . Eight out of nine times , you avoid decisions that could result in a negative outcome . I am not some collection of data you need to make sense of . - I 'm your sister . - " I 'm your sister . I 'm worried about you . Can 't you see that ? " - All I want is for you ... - " Is for you to be safe . - That 's all I 've ever wanted . " - Stop finishing my sentences and let me help . - " And let me help . I 've always been there for you . I 've always taken care of you . " That was fun . Don 't. I ... Don 't . - Don 't . - You didn 't expect that , did you ? Because you 've forgotten what it 's like to feel emotions . - No . - You 've forgotten us . - Mom gave you this as a reminder ... - No . - that you didn 't have to do more than you were able to that we loved you . - That 's irrelevant now . - Milo , please . I don 't recognize you anymore . I made a mistake when I signed you up . I didn 't mean this . You have to follow the rules . You have to do what they say . You 're overreaching . Remember this . Listen , what time 's your mommy gonna be home ? No , no , no . I don 't wanna hear you play your flute , kid . I 'm gonna call you back . Ha , ha . You just hung up on a child . You talk to the next witness . - I hope it 's a tuba player , okay ? - Ha , ha . Fine . Hi , this is Agent Dunham . Can you connect me to the next witness , please ? Excuse me ? - Hey , Charlie . - Yeah ? - Since when do we need a code ? - They upgraded the system last month . - You don 't remember ? - Sorry . I guess I 'm still getting over the head trauma . - Hey , Liv . - Yeah ? You remember that time we were in , uh , Coney Island ? We were riding the Hell Hole together , right ? You got sick and you threw up on the guy next to you ? Yeah . Except you threw up all over the person next to you . So you can stop trying to rewrite history . What made you think of that ? - Witness is from Coney . - Oh . Hey , wait a sec . Jillian Foster was a consultant for Gregston Electric . I don 't see the connection . The first victim worked at Bryant Hospital , right ? Yeah , Cole Arnett . They deal with neurological disorders . Alzheimer 's , Parkinson 's , PTSD . Topflight medical research . It says here that Gregston Electric owns a subsidiary company called the Ivon Medical Group . The Ivon Medical Group is listed as one of Bryant Hospital 's outside vendors . You 're driving . As hospitals go , not bad . Yeah , unless it 's run by an evil genius who 's creating accidents to kill people . - Good morning . - Welcome to Bryant . - What can I do for you ? - Agent Francis , Agent Dunham . We 're here to see your chief medical director . Hold on , I 'll let him know . Hi , Violet . Could you let Dr. Levin know Fringe agents are here ? He 'll just be a minute . - Are we being quarantined ? - No . Scout 's honor . You seeing what I 'm seeing ? Right there on the table . We 're definitely in the right place . So sorry for the delay . I 'm Dr. Levin . Agent Francis . Uh , Agent Dunham . Hi . Please , my office is right this way . Doctor , we just noticed a lot of your patients are using ballpoint pens . Many of our residents have trouble interfacing digitally due to their mental deficiencies . Pen and paper 's just a ... Well , an easier way to communicate . - Did you know Mr. Arnett well ? - We didn 't socialize outside of work but , uh , well , we were all devastated when we heard . - What about this woman ? - Yes . Jillian Foster . She , uh , worked with the Ivon Medical Group . They were conducting a drug trial here . You 're kidding me . Jeffrey Mayer ? You know him ? Yes , but I , uh , I don 't understand . He was killed too ? Doctor , we 're gonna have to question all your science and medical personnel . You 're not looking for a doctor . You 're looking for a patient . We started this study a year ago . We were working on creating nootropics . - Like smart drugs . - That 's right . All of our test subjects started with an IQ of less than 65 . Our aim was to increase their intelligence so they could function independently day to day . - That 's a worthy goal . - We thought so too . Oh , st ... Can you go back ? Stop . That 's him . Milo Stanfield . You don 't sound surprised . I 'm not . This was Milo five months ago . Measured IQ of 56 . Severe cognitive deficiency . Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two - six-five-three-five-eight-nine-seven ... He 's reciting the digits of pi . To 1000 decimal places while solving differential equations in his head . That is unbelievable . That was after one treatment . We gave him five . Every time we administered the protocol , his intelligence increased exponentially . The final phase of the project allows subjects to be released under the supervision of a guardian 's care . And after that ? After that , we return the subjects to their original state . A necessary part of human drug trials . We had to determine whether there are any permanent adverse side effects . Milo didn 't wanna be regressed . Which is why he went after Arnett . We thought it was an accident . I drove to Ivon and informed Jillian myself . She was concerned that the delay in regressing Milo might compromise the results . She offered to handle it herself . So Milo killed her too . So , what about the third victim , Jeffrey Mayer ? A recovery specialist who we contract with if somebody goes missing . The thing is , I only put the order in yesterday . Mr. Mayer had not yet been assigned the task . - Okay , so who 's Milo 's guardian ? - Uh , his sister . She lives out on Long Island . Oyster Bay , I believe . You think he 'd go back ? He 's gotta know that 's the first place people are gonna look . I 've been to Oyster Bay . I never saw an oyster . I can 't wait to tell Lincoln he was right . That this guy is able to start a chain reaction to commit murder . I 'm not watching the happy dance . - Can I help you ? - Fringe Division . We need to ask you a few questions . - Uh , about ? - About your brother . Milo . Three people ? That we know of , yeah . There must be some mistake . Milo wouldn 't kill innocent people . He didn 't think they were that innocent . After all , they were trying to cut off the medication that was making him smart . Right ? - Do you have any idea where he is now ? - He doesn 't confide in me anymore . You mind if I take a look at his room ? Go ahead . Last door on the left . Is that you ? Mm-hm . Milo and Madeline . Sounds like a kids ' book . You 're not the first person to say that . Aw , you seem close . We were . He was a lot older , but he liked the same cartoons played the same games . I had the opposite . My sister and I were close in age , but we fought over everything . Are you close now ? Uh , she passed a few years ago . I 'm sorry . That must have been really difficult . - It was . When I was little , I used to always be scared something would happen to Milo . He 'd forget to check for cars just run right into traffic . I worried that he 'd never be happy . He 'd never feel like ... Like he belonged . Must have been hard watching him struggle . It was harder for him . That 's why I agreed to the drug study . He isn 't that helpless person anymore . He 's dangerous . And I think you know that . So if there is anything that you can think of we just don 't wanna see anyone else get hurt , including your brother . It 's a ... It 's a goodbye note . But it says where I can reach him . Thank you . - Patricia Hotel , Lakewood Avenue . - Yeah . I 'm gonna call backup , get them to meet us . Hold on . What if that 's what Milo wants ? You know , that 's his M.O. Always 10 steps ahead . He knew his sister was gonna tell us ? Listen , he knows we 're onto him . He knows his sister . What if he 's trying to set us up ? Well , we can 't just stand here . - I can 't answer that . - Why not ? There is no answer . It 's a mathematical problem without a solution . Which scenario is likely ? We go to the Patricia Hotel , or we don 't . Suppose he predicts you 'll go . But you predict he 'll predict that , so you don 't . - So we shouldn 't go . - But then he predicts that . He changes his plan . Which means you should go . But then he predicts that you 'll predict what he predicted too . It 's an infinite spiral . Okay , well , thank you , Astrid . We 'll take it from here . - Where you going ? - To the hotel . - Liv . - Well , Charlie , he could be there now . - I 'm not willing to lose him , are you ? - Fine . You drive . Charlie , there he is . Oh , that wasn 't supposed to happen . Freeze . Here . Take it . Take it . Press the button . You move again , the next one won 't be in your leg , buddy . That 's it . You 're okay . Just breathe . Yeah , he wants to sweep the whole yard . Since when do you break protocol ? You passed by an auburn diamond , okay ? A blinking auburn diamond which you ignored . - A compromised air quality ... - Pressure 's normal . - Thank you . - Yeah . - You need oxygen to breathe . - Charlie , I 'm sorry . - I don 't know why I did that . - Because you 're a daredevil . Oh , I get it . So if you don 't mind I 'd appreciate it if we don 't go through this again . Okay . Enclose interval of pi to psi . The problem needs a solution . The drugs had been in his system too long . So the doctors weren 't able to reverse the effects . According to the doctors , the patterns that he sees are too complex to put into words . His thoughts now can only be interpreted by a machine . So the machine is talking to him ? Madeline , your brother he no longer thinks in terms that you or I would be able to comprehend . I 'm sorry . Enclose interval pi defined . Is equal value of six . Six is the solution . What is the solution ? Derives of gradient of Y. Evaluate a Y-4 and proceed . Isolate discontinuities and recalibrate . There 's a 42 percent chance that the king will take the queen . A result of transforming innermost specificity integral to respect the T-1 . Enclose interval of G and omega . Consecutive square of T-1 and T-2 cubed within derives a gradient vector of 5-Y and 5-6 . You know , sometimes I envy you , Brandon . Being here , nothing to distract you . Mr. Secretary , I didn 't realize you were coming . - These are my son 's clothes . - Yes . I thought if I used items from the other side it would provide an associative link which would spark Olivia to ... Cross over to the other universe . Yes , good thinking . - When will you be ready ? - We 're very close . So far , all the test subjects I 've hooked up to the chair they 're experiencing a high level of anxiety . Their stress is causing my readings to fluctuate . - I 've been tinkering with this all day . - The solution is obvious . Submerge the subject in water . A sensory deprivation tank . Of course . The womb-like atmosphere naturally provides a state of relaxation . Sometimes simpler is better . - Do you miss it ? - Miss what ? Being a scientist . I am still a scientist , Brandon . I just have a much larger laboratory . Let me know as soon as the tank 's ready . God , I don 't know how you do it . I 'm never done packing until the cab arrives . Well , I 'm off to deal with diseased people . So it 's not like I have to look good . - Oh , except you do . - Are you sure you 're okay with this ? - I can call Fiken , beg him to cover for me . - We have had this conversation . I know . I know . It 's just they haven 't told me yet how long I 'll be gone . So just keep me posted . That 's probably the cab . You know why you didn 't die today , right ? Because you didn 't know the protocol . If you 'd stopped for oxygen , you 'd be dead right now . But you did something that he couldn 't factor in . You kept running . You know why you did that . It 's the same reason you thought you saw Walter in the hospital . It 's the same reason you think you 're seeing me now . You 're not from this world , Olivia . You 're not her . You 're not real . Real is just a matter of perception . I am here . And I 'm the part of you that you have to hold onto . You can 't forget who you are , Olivia . You can 't forget where you 're from . You can 't forget this . What 's wrong ? Nothing . You just surprised me , that 's all . You all right ? Yeah . It 's just , I 'm gonna miss you . I 'm gonna miss you too . - I will be home as soon as I can . - Okay . Well , you call me when you land . All right . Bye .

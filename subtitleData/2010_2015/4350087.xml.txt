 [ Wedeck ] On October 6th , the planet blacked out for two minutes and 17 seconds . The whole world saw the future . Oh , my God . Come quick ! It 's your sister , Anabelle . I want to come home . Taking Anabelle , that was never part of the deal . You asked me to give you data . To tell you when we were running the experiment , that 's all . The deal is whatever we say it is . Anabelle is just insurance . - What 's that on his hand ? - [ Janis ] That looks like a ring . [ Simon ] A Quantum Entanglement Device . I 'm Gabriel McDow . I told you that . I definitely said that already . - You have to remember things , Olivia . - Why have you been following me ? You 're going the wrong way . The futures I saw , you 're always with Lloyd . You all know Fiona Banks , Ml6 . [ Fiona ] None of them had visions , and now they 're all dead . [ Al ] " The Blue Hand . No limits . No fear . " [ Wedeck ] A death club ? [ Demetri ] Slingerland . Am I saying that right ? It says you taught American history at South Fairfax High . The script for this conversation has already been written . Whatever you 've all seen is gonna happen . [ Man ] No . Celia 's death was an accident , OK ? It could 've happened to anyone . - Al ! - [ Al ] What I saw doesn 't have to play out that way . I found a way to change the game . [ All yelling ] Al ! You realize you 're wearing the same jacket you were wearing when we broke ground on the accelerator . - It was an accident , I suppose . - [ Chuckling ] [ Simon ] There are no accidents , Lloyd . I detect some sublimated sentiment bubbling to the surface . This is a big deal for both of us . We 've been working on tachyons for 12 years . This is our moment , Simon . - Go with it . - Cheers . Cheers . God , I hope it all works . We 're simulating the big bang . What could go wrong ? - [ Chuckling ] - [ Phone ringing ] - Excuse me . - Sure . It 's Mum . Hello . What ? When ? OK . Uh ... Is Anabelle all right ? Just ... just tell her I 'll be on the first flight home . Yeah . OK , you , too . Bye . Uh ... My dad died . [ Female voice over PA ] Activation in one minute . - [ man ] Initiating now . - [ woman ] All right . This experiment was designed by Dr. Campos , who , unfortunately , could not be with us on this day when we recreate the beginning of the universe . Lloyd Simcoe , Dr. Campos ' mentor , the brain behind the brain . This is Angie Tremont from the New Science Report . - A journalist ? - It 's all right . She 's been cleared . Oh , sorry . We have a rather strict confidentiality protocol , - so we 're a little wary of the press . - It 's a pleasure to meet you . Dr. Myhill 's been telling me all about the project . - Your crowning glory . - Well , it 's been a team effort . Gordon , the preliminary firings have started . - [ Phone ringing ] - The big moment . Yes ? They 're ready . [ Female voice ] Activation in 30 seconds . Initiate . Here goes nothing . - [ Computers beeping ] - Or everything . [ Female voice ] Activation commencing in 20 seconds . [ Machines whirring ] [ Female voice ] Activation commencing in ten seconds . Nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one . [ Olivia ] Hey , honey . [ Charlie ] Go ahead . It 's your home , too . [ Indistinct voices overlapping ] [ Alarm blaring in distance ] [ Lloyd ] The visions people had are really only just possible futures . The universe operates within certain parameters , but there is some flexibility . With one week till the 29th , Dr. Simcoe , we are all still wondering what to expect . It 's a well-known precept in quantum physics that observations shape reality . You 're saying that seeing our futures may , in fact , change our futures . [ Lloyd ] That 's the theory , yes . But the future does have a way of fighting back . [ Newswoman ] What do you mean by that ? [ Lloyd ] Small things may change , but the forces of the universe may be pushing us towards the futures we have seen . [ Newswoman ] That 's interesting . What about the people who learned from Mosaic they were meant to die before the 29th but lived past the fatal event ? Those people are the statistical anomalies at the edge of the curve . [ Newswoman ] Should you still be worried ? Because it sounds like you 're saying the universe may course-correct , that they might not have escaped their fates after all . [ Lloyd ] Yes , that 's possible . [ Newswoman ] So maybe a better word for " course-correction " is " destiny " ? I 'm just a scientist , I 'm not really qualified to answer that question . I 'd like to welcome tonight 's next guest , Celia Quinones . Ms. Quinones is the young woman whose future was changed by the suicide of FBI Agent Al Gough , one of Dr. Simcoe 's " statistical anomalies . " Ms. Quinones , take us through your experience . First , I would like to say again to the family of Agent Gough how grateful my family and I are for his actions . In the first weeks after the blackout , I heard that not having a vision meant that I would be dead on April 29th . [ Newswoman ] That must 've been terrifying for you . [ Celia ] When I discovered on the Mosaic website that I would be hit by a car , I lived in constant terror - that I might die at any moment . - But you didn 't . I 'm sure a lot of people have questions , so let 's open up the phone lines . Muncie , Indiana , you 're on the air . [ Man ] This question 's for Dr. Simcoe . Is it possible the blackout caused permanent brain damage to anyone ? - There 's no reason to believe so . - Well , people 's lives have been ruined . What if this happens again ? It is critical that people remain calm . And I must repeat that no one 's brain was damaged in any way by the blackout itself . [ Lloyd ] And let me reassure you it is impossible that there could be another blackout . - I almost believe him myself . - Yeah , tell me again why we 're not telling people there 's another blackout coming ? We don 't know when it 's gonna happen . We tell people but don 't say when , the world will turn into an armed camp . So , Celia , you 're confident that your future has changed ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . Thank you for joining us today . Any last words , Dr. Simcoe ? Come the 29th , I believe that we will all end up where we 're supposed to be . - " Supposed to be " ? - That doesn 't mean we can 't decide our fate . [ Newswoman ] ... author of the award-winning book Teens and Truth . She 's going to help us figure how to talk about ... Stop ! Stop ! That 's my sister ! [ Horn honking ] - Anabelle ! Anabelle ! - Stop there ! Stop ! Don 't come any closer or they 'll kill me ! - Who ? What ? - They 're watching . They 'll shoot me . What ? Who ? What do they want ? They said they want you and the ring . They got your message , and they 're sending one back . You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . - Anabelle . - Please , Simon . Give them what they want . They were very specific . You only have 12 hours to give them the ring or they will kill me . Get in the car . Just go . - Anabelle , I 'm not leaving you here . - Get in the car . - Anabelle ... - Just go ! Please , just go ! Let 's go . Now . Zampieron ? Tech wizard extraordinaire ? I 'll take that as a " yes . " - License plate ? - You are good . What I 'd like to know is whose car that belongs to . Yeah , I can definitely do this . Simple . Just gotta run it by the head man . That 's the part of the process I 'd like you to omit . - No can do . - Name your price . Anything ? - Hey , you . - [ Bryce ] Hey . How do you always know when I 'm here ? Stalking . Internet . Paid informants . You know , the usual . I ... I brought you a book . It 's one of my favorites , and it helped me a lot with my mom . I wish ... I wish you 'd tell me when you 're getting chemo . I don 't want you to feel obligated to come . It 's not an obligation . [ Indistinct police chatter ] LAPD called . Someone claiming to be Ml6 used my name to get access to a crime scene . Hello , Demetri . You 're looking well . You too , Fiona . So ... I 'm guessing you didn 't fly all the way in from London just ' cause you missed me . No . Andrew Weeks was supposed to die on March the 2nd from a drug allergy , but he survived the date . - He made a big deal out of it , too ? - [ Fiona ] His wife heard him fall , came running out and found him dead . No sign of anyone coming in or out of the house . If I 'm living on borrowed time , I might avoid a room full of guns . Except he wasn 't shot . He was bleeding from the mouth and nose , so Forensics field-tested his coffee . - It showed positive for warfarin . - Rat poison ? That explains the bleeding . I don 't get it . You got a room full of guns , and you poison a guy . Why ? Weeks was supposed to die from a drug allergy , not a gunshot wound . The killer was trying to get as close as possible to the original cause of death . - That was in his papers . - These are directions - to a Blue Hand gathering . - That 's why I 'm here . Four Blue Handers dead in the LA area in the last three weeks . Each knew exactly how and when they were supposed to die but lived past their death date . I was in Anaheim investigating when I got word of this one . You really think someone 's trying to knock off survivors ? It 's just a hunch . What was I supposed to say ? " Yes , there 's gonna be another blackout . Sorry , we just can 't tell you when . " So you said what you had to . I mean , people are terrified . You gave ' em hope . No , what I gave them was a lie . What would give people hope is if Simon and I could crack this QED technology . Then at least people wouldn 't black out in the first place . What about that caller who asked about brain damage ? I mean , I 've never even considered that . No . If the blackout could cause brain damage , we would 've picked up on it a long time ago . I know how much this is weighing on you . I wish there was something I could do to help . Olivia ... You already are . Hey . - You wanted to see me ? - You may think that promising a junior analyst a weekend at the Bunny Ranch will get him to jeopardize his job , but it won 't . My sister ran away from home after the blackout . I saw her this morning . She was in a white van - with that license plate . - So you just figured you 'd have - one of my agents help you out ? - I have to find her . We ran the plate . Van was stolen two days ago in San Francisco . Traffic cam ... picked this up . [ Mark ] That 's a nice story , Simon , but how about the truth ? You wanna tell me what the hell 's going on ? I was trying to have her come with me . The people she 's with , they have some sort of ... hold over her . You 're lying . She didn 't run away . She was kidnapped . Look at her body language . She 's terrified . - How long have you known ? - Don 't know what you 're talking about . Don 't play games with me . This is your sister . Exactly . My sister . That 's why I 'll do anything to find her . That 's what I 'm afraid of . Someone knows you feel this way , they 'll use it against you as leverage . And considering what you know , I 'd say they could get a lot . Are you suggesting I 've been compromised ? I don 't know what you 've been , but I do know one thing . You 've been lying . And now you 've put the entire Mosaic investigation in jeopardy . [ Lloyd ] What do you think ? Something in the ring 's structure has to be maintaining superposition . It 's keeping people awake , but how ? You 're not even listening . " Maintaining superposition " was what you said , - and I have no idea . - Do you want to focus a little ? We 've done enough damage . Maybe we can put something right . Look , just because you feel guilty about lying on the news and want to save the world doesn 't mean we can make it happen . We can , and it 's not about feeling guilty . - Yeah , right . - It 's about preventing more deaths . It 's all Lloyd Simcoe 's fault , and now he can save the day . It 's a little messianic , don 't you think ? What are you talking about ? Millions of deaths . It 's an overwhelming concept . Numbers like that , you lose track of individuals . They fall through the cracks . - A single person doesn 't even matter . - OK , now you 're losing me . My sister . Anabelle ? So , what are you talking about ? - She 's been kidnapped . - When ? A few days after the blackout . Why would anyone kidnap your sister ? - I have no idea . - What do the police say ? The FBI are on it . There 's nothing more I can do . Why didn 't you tell me ? I would 've helped . Oh , yeah ? How ? Well , I don 't know , but I ... Now , I just feel useless . Well , it 's not about you , Lloyd . I had to deal with the situation as best I could for Anabelle . Now , I 'm sorry I didn 't keep you in the loop . I 've been kinda busy . Why would he hide the fact his sister was kidnapped ? The polygraph 's inconclusive . You really think he 's compromised ? There 's nothing concrete , but ... Look , Mark , I don 't like this situation any more than you do , but we need Simon . We 'll look for his sister . Find her , and find out what they want from him . [ Bell ringing ] I never thought we 'd be talking to this guy again . Everyone , next week 's reading ... Schopenhauer . Mr. Slingerland ? Agent Noh . I 'm so glad to see you again . This is Inspector Banks . - I remember you , too . - Mr. Slingerland . - What 's going on ? - Do you recognize this man ? Yeah , that 's Andrew . Andy Weeks . I remember seeing him at the Blue Hand gatherings . That was a while ago . I 'm not really into that anymore . - Why do you ask ? - He 's dead . - How ? - Murdered . [ Sighing ] Poor Andy . Guess he thought he was in the clear . But I suppose the universe has to balance itself . Excuse me ? Life is energy , you see . As each new life begins , another ends . If you mess with that balance , the universe pushes back . Andy was a good guy . I 'm sorry . We need you to put together a list of the Blue Handers who knew Mr. Weeks . Can you do that for us ? - Be happy to . - And you might want to be careful . We think someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates . People like you . So you don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? Just watch you back , is what we 're saying . I will , Agent Noh . [ Bryce ] Gabriel 's blood work came back . So besides his feet , everything seems OK . The left foot looks good . His right still looks pretty bad . OK , let 's finish up the antibiotics , and we 'll reevaluate tomorrow . - OK . - [ woman on PA ] Orderlies to admitting . - Where 's Charlie ? - Hey , you ! Charlie 's at school . What are you doing here ? Occupational therapy , which I completely forgot about . Dylan was hoping to see you , and ... so was I. - Hi . - Hi . [ Gabriel ] Lloyd ? Lloyd Simcoe ? Lloyd ? I knew it . I knew it . I said it would happen . - I saw it would happen . I knew it . - I beg your pardon ? You 're supposed to be with Olivia . She 's not supposed to be with the other . Gabriel , let 's go . Come on . Back to bed . Let 's go . - I need my shoes . - [ Olivia ] Your shoes didn 't fit . - That 's why your feet were bleeding . - I liked those shoes . I know . We 'll get you some more shoes . We will . Let 's go . [ Singing ] # Lloyd and Olivia sitting in a tree ... # Yeah , OK . I 'll explain later . Let 's go . - OK . - [ Olivia ] Let 's go , Gabriel . Inside . Gabriel , get into bed . Come on . Let 's go . So good . So good that you 're together with Lloyd now . - No , we 're not together . - You 're together with Lloyd . - It 's so good . - You know what ? We 're not together , Gabe . We 're just ... It 's complicated . We 're ... You 're the best thing since sliced bread . Yes ? You 're the best thing since sliced bread . In we go . [ Vreede ] Can I come in ? - Brought lunch . Hi , Gabriel . - Where 's the beef ? - I got it right here . - Go ahead . So how 's he doing ? - He 's better . - Good . We got a lot of questions , and I 'm gonna have to bring him into the FBI . You know what ? He hasn 't finished his IV antibiotics . He needs a brain scan . He 's not going anywhere for a few days . Would it be all right if I just ask him a few questions here , then ? - Sure . - Thank you . Hey , buddy . Can I ask you a question ? I found this in your things . You wanna tell me what this is ? [ Gabriel ] My book . It 's all there . But what is this a picture of ? Gabriel , this is important . I saw it . I was there , on a trip . I saw it . - A flash forward . - Oh , no . Oh , no ! Oh , no ! I don 't like pickles ! - It 's OK . - I don 't like pickles ! I don 't like lettuce ! I hate onions ! I ... I like tomatoes . I like ... I like tomatoes . - Now , where are we ? - Starting from where we first pick up the van Campos ' sister was in , 6th Street bridge . Then we headed south . We picked them up here , and then here , and then they head into this weird zone downtown . Eight blocks wide . Coverage there is sketchy , so we lost them . - You can 't get me any more than that ? - I 'm not a magician . Any way we can pick up the van coming out of that zone ? Well , there are over a hundred exits . It 'd take at least a day and a half - to go through all that footage . - It 's only eight blocks . We can do a sweep in less time than whiz kid here . - You found something . - Just following up on a tip . - I 'm coming with you . - No , you 're not . - Yes , I am . - No , you 're not ! Listen to me , Simon . You 're here for one reason and one reason only : To work on the QED . Your volunteering here is starting to feel a little convenient . I don 't trust you , Simon . Not for a minute . - That 's your prerogative . - You 're damn right it is , and that 's not gonna work out too well for you . Right now , I 'm gonna go get your sister back . And after I do , you and I are gonna have a little sit-down . No more lying . They said they want you and the ring . They got your message , and they 're sending one back . - You have 12 hours , or they 'll kill me . - Anabelle . Please , Simon . Give them what they want . Thanks for coming by . I wanted to go over your latest serologies with you . Your tumor markers are undetectable . Lymphocytes are back to normal . Wait . Does that mean that I 'm ? Experimental protocol seems to be working . Your cancer is officially in remission . What ? What ? - What ? - We 've been optimistic for a few weeks . I just didn 't want to get your hopes up . I 've had two other oncologists check those results , - and it 's working . - That 's incredible . [ Chuckling ] What are you waiting for ? Go on . Get out of here . The future awaits . Yeah . [ Chuckling ] - You wanted to see me ? - Oh . Yeah . We have a shift down at immigration tonight giving flu shots to detainees . Can you help out ? - Sure . Happy to . - OK , great . Take a look through these files and see what you 're getting yourself into . Don 't worry . It 's all basic . Nothing you can 't handle . OK ? Thank you . [ Demetri ] Have you been working all day ? Since 5 : 00 in the morning . Do you know this man ? Someone tampered with his coffee . Yeah . Andy . - You 're sure ? - Yeah , he 's a regular . - He 's here every day . So am I. - When 's the last time you saw him ? Yesterday . He was here with some guy , chatting away like they were old pals . Made a big deal about surviving something , - his whole life to look forward to . - What 'd his friend look like ? I don 't know . Tall , kinda geeky-looking , wearing this big , ugly horseshoe ring . [ Slingerland ] Life is energy , you see . As each new life begins , another ends . Mess with that balance , the universe ... - You 're sure ? - Yeah , Andy . ... pushes back . " You can do what you will , but at any given moment of your life , you can will only one definite thing . Nothing other than that thing . " What do you guys think that means ? - That free will is a lie ? - [ Car doors slamming ] Exactly . Where 's Mr. Slingerland ? I don 't know . He was here , and then he just left . Are you Agent Noh ? - He wanted me to tell you something . - What ? The universe always pushes back . You might want to be careful . We think someone 's killing the people that lived past their death dates . You don 't want me to go on television and announce it to the world ? I 'm still here . The universe seems to have a different plan for me . He 's trying to course-correct . I think I know who he 's going after next . [ Engine starting ] Celia Quinones , welcome to your future . [ Tires squealing ] - [ People screaming ] - [ Car alarms blaring ] Run ! Celia , run ! Run ! Go ! Celia , now ! Run ! South on Grand ! He 's heading south on Grand ! Freeze ! FBI ! [ Gasping ] [ Screaming ] - No ! - She just ran in front of me ! I couldn 't stop ! She 's still alive . She 's still alive . EMTs to Grand and 6th . Priority 3 ! Code 1 ! Move ! Move ! - She was just there , Demetri . - She 's all right . Stay with her ! [ Grunting ] She 's not dead . She 's alive . You failed . Not yet . Anyway it 's not me . It 's the universe , which never fails . [ Gasping ] It 's funny . I was supposed to have an aneurysm , but you killed me instead . Gets done either way . See you soon ... sport . [ Alarm beeping ] Simon . - Here to make up for my bad behavior . - Don 't worry about it . You 've been under a lot of stress lately . - I just wanted to say thanks . - For what ? Cambridge , the Brewschlagger Fellowship , for getting me into NLAP . I did it for selfish reasons , Simon . You make me look good . Gracious as well . You helped me out and you know it . - I wouldn 't be anywhere without you . - OK , what 's going on ? I 'm sorry I didn 't tell you about Anabelle . Truly , I am . I should 've months ago . It 's been eating away at me , and I 've been pretending I was fine . I should have said something . Well , I 'm ... I 'm sorry I couldn 't help . I would have , you know . Yeah , I know you would . You 're the only real friend I have . You are clearly in need of a drink . Come on . You 're not wrong , but I ... I have to be somewhere . I 'll see you , Lloyd . Hey . Hey ! Nicole . I 've been looking all over for you . - What 's the matter ? - I , um ... I ... - I have something I have to tell you . - Yeah . Me , too . OK ... then . You 're never gonna believe this . My cancer is in remission . - I know ! - Oh , my God ! Bryce , that 's amazing ! I 'm still completely in shock , and it got me thinking about my future , and I don 't want to waste any more time . Are you sure ? I mean , what we saw is ... No , forget what we saw . We 're here , now . This is all that matters . What happened to Celia ... There was nothing we could do . [ Al ] You know , I 've been thinking about our bird . What if you tape the window ? - How do you mean ? - Well , if you cover the window , - the bird might not crash into it . - It 's a nice thought . But I think it 'll probably just crash into a different window . Maybe . But it 's worth a shot . Hm . [ Phone ringing ] It 's the hospital calling . - Hello ? - [ man ] Agent Fiona Banks ? - Yes . - I 'm calling about Celia Quinones , and I 'm afraid it 's bad news . Her physical and neurological injuries are extensive , and I 'm not optimistic about her chance of survival . Oh , my God . You 're gonna call again on the 29th to tell me that she 's gone . Ms. Banks , what happened to Celia was an accident . There are no accidents anymore . [ Wedeck ] Mark , we 're running out of time for Campos ' sister . [ Mark ] I 've covered a five-block radius . Only three to go . [ Sirens in distance ] Whoa . I 'm sorry . Special Agent Benford . FBI . Looks like they got you working late . Yeah . Some clown ran right into this , nearly took out the electrical box . Pulled into that warehouse driving crazy . That 's a lot of damage . Imagine what the van looked like . Imagine . I think I found the van . Put me through to SWAT . - [ Man ] OK , move ! - [ Guns cocking ] Go ! Move . It 's OK . It 's OK . You 're safe now . I 'm here . [ Ringing ] - Yes ? - It 's Mark . We got her , Simon . She 's sitting right next to me . Thank God . Is she all right ? Exhausted , confused , but physically she 's fine . Can I talk to her for a second ? I just wanna hear her voice . All right , but then you and I need to talk , and you need to tell me everything . No more lies , Simon . Fine . He wants to talk to you . Simon ? Belle . Is that really you ? I 'm really tired , Simon . I wanna go home and see Mom . I know . I just wanted to make sure you were safe . No matter what happens , baby sister , remember I love you . - I love you , too . Goodbye , Belle . - Simon . - Goodbye , Mark . He took the damn ring . [ Lloyd ] What am I looking at ? So this is Gabriel McDow 's brain . No brain damage . And he had hundreds of flash forwards . Now , these are taken from people who were being scanned at the time of the blackout on October 6th . Same thing . No damage . Nothing . Nothing unusual . So you weren 't lying about this in your interview . Thanks . Makes me feel a bit better . Good . Well , so this McDow is a savant ? Yeah . He 's pretty high-functioning . Incredible memory . And he thinks we should be together . Uh ... That 's what he saw in his flash forwards . Were we happy ? I know how I felt in mine . [ Knocking at door ] I need to talk to you . [ Olivia ] I was just leaving . Thanks for the scans , Olivia . I really appreciate it . - Sure . Excuse me . - See you later . Bye , Mark . I 'll call you . Simon Campos has disappeared . - What ? - He 's gone . He came to see me tonight . It was the strangest thing . It was like he was trying to say goodbye . The day of the blackout , anything about his behavior seem ... strange ? Well , I don 't know . He was in Toronto at his father 's funeral . Uh ... My dad died . My God , Simon . What happened ? There was an accident . I have to go home . Yes , of course . Then we 'll postpone until you get back . No . Stick to the plan . But the system 's still on standby . What difference does a week make ? What 's the rush ? No , we 've worked too long , too hard at this . We have to stay on schedule . It has to be October 6th , 11 am . No delays . I never understood why he would miss that moment . After all those years of work , and we could 've changed the date . Is Simon Campos capable of engineering a global blackout ? He 's capable of anything . And he always has a plan . [ Zampieron ] Once we realized his involvement in the blackout was deeper than we thought , I went back and I ran this gait analysis on Simon Campos and on Suspect Zero . Not only are they comparable in height , weight and age , they 're a 99th percentile match in spatial-temporal and kinematic classes . [ Wedeck ] But Suspect Zero was in Detroit , and we have multiple eyewitnesses that put Simon at his father 's funeral in Toronto the same day . I checked inbound flights to airports around Detroit . On October 6th , a G4 with Canadian tail numbers requested an emergency maintenance landing at Willow Run . They wouldn 't have filed a flight plan . Plane was on the ground for a couple of hours then right back to Toronto . He could 've gotten to the stadium , then back to the airport by then . Show me that footage again . Simon Campos is Suspect Zero . If I showed you pictures , Anabelle , could you identify any of these guys ? We need to find the men who took you . No . I never saw any faces . They always wore these weird masks . Please , can I go home now ? I know you 're tired . Just one more question . What did they want from Simon ? I told you . I don 't know . They just left me in the van . They said they were done with me . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? Anabelle . What did they want him for ? I promise you . Nothing bad will happen to Simon . Think real hard . Did you overhear anything ? Anything at all ? They said he 's going to cause another blackout .

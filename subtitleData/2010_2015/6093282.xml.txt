 Did you know ? Receptors who contract the X virus become Galactors . Yes , but as long as the Stone glows , it protects us . And if it didn 't glow ... Then you 'd have to ... " Eastern Europe , 2015 " Early in the 21st Century , strange creatures appeared from nowhere , starting a war on a planetary scale . A red " shield " protected them , deflecting any form of attack . No human weapons had a chance against them . 17 days after the war started , the creatures occupied half the world . And they called themselves , " Galactors . " Survivors grieved for the millions of casualties . Children were separated from family and orphaned . People lived in restricted areas ... as they waited to die . There was only one hope the humans had of surviving . - Ken , behind you ! - Run ! Hand me the Stone . Ken ! He 's awakened . He 's a Receptor . The Stone is a crystal with amazing powers that some can harness and control . That 's us , the modern day ninja . " Gatchaman " " Tokyo , 13 years after the invasion " Galactor 's genocide continues across the mountain region at the south of North Kyoushou in the early morning of the 19th . The unemployment rate has risen to 29.3 % . That 's a 2.6 % increase since last month . The number of immigrants has reached 9 million . As tension of the surrounding regions reached a new high , the police is considering the reinforcement of the guard force . Hey , Sis ... Don 't worry , I bought it with my allowance . I know but ... Are these for the mission ? Going undercover as a regular girl has its price ! What 's that ? For observing and gathering information . It 's the mainframe ... People will hear you ! What ? Watch out ! You 're the one hacking it ! Why hack it when you have authorized access ? Hacking 's easier than doing it legally . Why not hack a 3-star restaurant site and steal me a recipe ! Accept that you 're a bad cook . I 'll come and see you when I can , Mom . Don 't worry , mom . I 'll come soon . Okay , bye ... hey ! One moment ! Follow the doctor 's instructions and take your medicine so you 'll get better . Thank you . See you . End CoveOps . The day has come . The enemy will target the ISO meeting where scientists , officials and capitalists will gather from around the world . It 's Operation Last Suicide . Operation ... Last Suicide ? This is your first combat mission . But fight as if it 's your last . Roger . Look at that ! A Galactor 's " Treader " is approaching the West Shinjuku post . This is a red alert . I repeat . A Galactor 's " Treader " ... Move it ! Fire at will ! Fire ! Fire ! Enemy at 701 B. Request reinforcements ! Surprisingly , a Galactor 's DNA is 99 % the same as humans . " ISO Tokyo Command Central " The 1 % separating us from Galactors is the X virus . The atrocious Galactors destroyed civilization and massacred our fellow humans . Drawing power from the X virus . It was back in 1718 . From an archeological ruin deep in Africa we retrieved 28 crystals with mysterious origin . Yes , the Stones . Red alert ! The Galactor 's biomechanics are closing fast . Estimated target : command central . Evacuate to the underground shelter immediately . I repeat . Order please . Do not panic . We 've already deployed countermeasures . The Stones generate light . We call the energy " G-Particles . " It 's strong enough to penetrate the Galactor shield . It intercepts the X virus making it inactive . Can you see me , Galactors ? I 'm a shadow , too fast to see . A white phantom . This is just a stone for regular people but in the hands of G-Agents , it 's a light of hope . We recruited the Receptors and trained them . They 're our last line of defense against the Galactors . That 's my tech ninja dummy trick . No time for chat ! They were both mine . Now the Treader . The boogie is traveling east at 40kms per hour . It will reach ISO Command Central in 7 ' 20 " . There 's an inferno ! Permission to use Heavy-metal-core shells . Negative , not with these civilians . Back up the G-Force instead . This is the G-Force . Approaching boogie in 40 sec . Roger . Don 't forget the recipes . I knew you 'd say that . No time for chat ! Approaching the intersection . The boogie continues towards central Tokyo . We 'll keep following it . Roger that . I got a match on the database . It 's a 363-B . It has a PCB bomb . If detonated here it 'll kill 1 million . We 'll stop it with harpoons . Roger that . You 're going nowhere ! Son of a bitch ! Jun ! Roger that . Ryu , Jinpei , watch out ! You shall be punished , obey . The boogie 's 2km from Command Central and closing in . That 's in 3 minutes . That hurt ! What are you ? I 'll get you ! One , two ! Ouch ! Jinpei ? What 's wrong ? Jun , stay on the job . You only have 100 seconds . Disarm the bomb . Got it . Adios . Awesome ! Do you know him ? Okay , this is the last wire . Defused ! Hey , what 's going on ! 30 seconds to detonation ! Jupiter is in the Moon 's shadow . Open portal . Hey , wait a minute ! 10 seconds ! 8 ! 7 ! 6 ! 5 ! 4 ! 3 ! Zero ! Sis ! A piece of cake . Good job on your first combat , Ken . George ... Ken , do you know him ? You siblings ask the same questions ! Ryu , use your brain when you fight . Don 't be like a 20th Century PC . - Dare you ... - How come you know us ? I saw your profiles on the database . I 'm from ISO Europe . The name 's George Asakura . Good to meet you . You too . And you ! " ISO Far East " Uh ... Thanks for helping my brother out of trouble . It won 't always go like that . Missions come first . If I was in trouble , you should stay on the job . Sure . That 's the prime directive . You know George well ? Yes . I 've known him for 13 years . Ever since the Galactors killed my parents . Like they killed yours . They 're not dead ! They were captured . Sorry , you 're right . We 'll rescue them one day . Yes ! I 'll cook for him one day . Let me tell you another funny story . The Ape slipped in the bath ... Shut up , Monkey ! Mock me and I 'll punish you . - Quiet Ape ! - Okay . That 's enough of your silly stories . May I ask if you two stay together ... in your free time ? No way ! I only babysit him when we 're on duty . Jun , teach your brother some manners . Fine-tune the anti-G ... You are nothing to her ! And transient EMP for me . Ryu 's always going to the hospital with some ailment . Even for a sneeze . Aren 't these checkups enough ? I 'd go for a cough not for a sneeze . Same difference ! Did you pick that up from the database ? I can see you two are close without that . Me and the Ape ! Give me a break ! - Watch your mouth , Monkey ! - Shut up , Ape ! What 's Ken up to ? Dunno . Except that he eats hotdogs everyday . For good luck , I guess . Ken 's life revolves around missions . My sister told Ken she loved him and got turned down . Jinpei ! I 'm just keeping the crew informed . I told Ken nothing ! Who 'd want a girl who can 't cook ? Ken only eats hotdogs . - It 's Naomi ... - What ? He turned you down because of Naomi . Naomi ... Wow , a love triangle ! I knew it ! Naomi ... Naomi . Do you love him more now because there 's a rival ? Yes . What ? No ! That 's not what I meant ! Come on , Sis . - Now we know . I totally understand that . I didn 't ask you . There 's nothing on your profile about you rejecting Jun. How 's Europe ? When we rush to refugees ' SOS signals , we find a pile of bodies . Galactors get there first . I saw tens of thousands of bodies in a year . That 's how long G-Agents have been deployed in Europe . I missed out on my childhood to train hard . Yet I 'm helpless . What are we fighting for ? We don 't need a reason . The Stones chose us . Only we can fight the Galactors . The choice is not ours . Ken , you 've changed . You follow the book . And me ... I just want to avenge Naomi 's death . What you said now ... Are you serious ? Dr. Kirkland . My tests show positive results . Your puppets are no longer needed in this battle . I can finish it in a second . And end the war ! And you will not oppose me . Excuse me . Lucky you . You 'll be free soon . I want your opinion as a leader about George . He might disobey and disrupt the prime directive . Like you did 5 years ago ? Yes . Go back to Tokyo . Galactor 's Last Suicide is underway . We know their true target now . Those Galactor Officers you fought opened the dimensional portal and another portal opened in Sector 84 at 203 N. Berg Katze ! While the enemy cyborgs distracted us , they entered Tokyo . I never expected Berg Katze to be ... a woman . We 've got to catch her . We will when Intelligence locates her . In the meantime we got orders to protect an informant . He knows all about Operation Last Suicide . Is he reliable ? Yes . His name is Ilia . Galactor 's number 2 . After failing to oust Berg Katze , Ilia sought asylum in Tokyo . Berg Katze came after him . You know what this means ? Our job is to protect Ilia and stop Last Suicide . Roger that . George . I 'm warning you . Don 't kill Ilia . And put the future before revenge ? Right . You 'd better watch out for yourself . " Tokyo , 6 hours later " Enjoy the party . Ro-ger ! How do I look ? You could say something nice . Are you speechless ? Talk to me , Jinpei . One minute . Quick . We 're going in . George . Take care of them . Aye-aye . Go ahead . Alight . Place your hand there . Okay . Please . Alight . Please . Okay . Place your hand there . Jinpei , now . I 'm on it ! Fail again ... Alight . Place your hand there . Okay . Please . Okay . Place your hand there . Sir , your hand . Oh . Once more please .. Are you okay ? So weird it is . It may be out of order . Please . Okay . Excuse me ? I love your tie . My mistake . Not at all . Please . That was close ... Let 's find Ilia . Wait . You 're not my wife ! What happened between you and Ilia ? You and George know something . You 're not telling us . When you guys were in basic training . George , I and another agent were in a team training at the European front . The 3 of us were together from the start . But 5 years ago , a Galactor killed our agent on a rescue operation . Ilia was the killer . And now we 're protecting him . And the agent was Naomi ? Did George tell you ? Did you love Naomi ? Leave it alone . It might get in our way ! It won 't ! Don 't get me wrong . This is weird . Don 't worry , Jun. Naomi was my girl . We loved each other . Ken was happy for us . You two were great together . What a relief . Let 's go find Ilia . Wait a second . Say that again ? " 5 years earlier , Central Asia " You didn 't hear me ? I can 't believe my ears . Did you just ask me to marry you ? Marry me , Naomi . You 're proposing to me on a bus ? They 'll be our witnesses . You 're so free and easy ! The cease-fire line 's 4km away . Answer me before we get back . I 'm happy for you . Yes , then . She said Yes ! We did it , Ken ! She said Yes ! You 're supposed to hug me ! Naomi . I 'll protect you . So they finally deployed G-Agents in Tokyo . Mr. Ilia , you 're under our protective custody . Done . Jinpei , my headset is acting up . There 's interference . I 'll get you another one . Stand by . Okay . I 've seen your profiles . Unmask yourselves so I can verify your identities . If you 're not who you say you are everybody here will die . It 's you , kid . Are you happy ? Was my request for asylum granted ? Yes , after you told us about Last Suicide . Hey ! What 's happened here ? Oh , darn ! Jinpei . There 's something wrong with the headset . Jinpei . Hey . Aren 't you hungry ? Of course ! Ryu , where are you ? Something 's up . Jun. Ryu ! Oh , blast it ! I was double-crossed ! Jun ! Sis , Ken ! Protect Ilia ! I see . If you shoot me point blank , I die . Will you shoot me ? Put the gun down . Ken , you hate him too . We 're here to protect Ilia , not to kill him . He killed Naomi ! Just put the gun down ! We 're agents . Ken . You loved Naomi , too . Didn 't you ? Don 't make me ... shoot you . Naomi . I 'll protect you . Thank you , guys ! We 'll happily accept presents . George ! George ... Bastards ... Ken , the Stone isn 't glowing . We have to pull out . - No ! - Ken , that 's an order ! Ken ! Naomi ! When you 're in bad shape , the Stone 's powerless . Then you retreat . It 's an elementary procedure . Where is Naomi ? Her body wasn 't recovered . George refuses to work with you . It was my error . I 'll leave . A Receptor can 't retire from duty . You 'll be transferred to the Far East facility . Damn . Damn you ... I 'm damn stupid ! Humans are foolish ... If I don 't comply , you 'll freeze me in 600 tons of liquid nitrogen . You put me in an electromagnetic cage . Is this how you treat political refugees ? Tell me more about the Last Suicide . You 'll execute me as soon as I tell you . That 's not my order . Never mind your orders . Kill me if you want to . You 're free to do so . Just tell me . You loved that woman . And I killed her and took her away from you . Will you destroy Tokyo ? What happened ? You 've changed . What do you mean ? You want to kill me but you can 't . You have to keep me alive for information . You just obey orders like a dog . What 's the Last Suicide ? I see . Maybe you 're the one who caused that woman 's death . Tell me . If so ... it 's you who kill her . Tell me ! Do you want to kill yourself by your own hand ? What ? The Last Suicide is a scheme to destroy Tokyo and all the ISO officials . And ... only Berg Katze knows how it will be done . I 'm happy for you . You can kill me now . Tell me why Berg Katze came to Tokyo . Listen . Berg Katze is mad . Kill her before she kills you . Director General ! What 's happing , Dr. Karkland ? There is only the practice of that strategy . It 's seems like a unexperiment stage . Excuse me ? I lived at this time and I developed Moscorne . I let you succeed by all means . Is Dr. Kirkland there ? Or you can give him a message . I have to confess my sin . Doctor . I killed your wife . I didn 't just kill her . I tortured her and left her to die . Because she was your wife , Dr. Kirkland . Stop it . It 's loaded with real ammo . In order to learn what Dr. Kirkland was testing , I had to put his wife through agonizing pain . Shut up ! But don 't worry . Shut down the video . She didn 't talk . Dr. Kirkland . Because she loved you . Gentlemen , I have a suggestion . We 're on standby . We are ? Why ? Do we wait for them to attack Tokyo ? Dr. Kirkland 's plan is going ahead . He and his team developed Moscone , an orbital G-Particle beam cannon . G-Particle beams from orbit ! That 's right . It 'll break the shields and destroy Casablanca and 5 major cities where the Galactors live . Destroy the cities ? What about the prisoners the Galactors use for slave labor ? Like Dr. Nambu 's family . That 's just collateral damage . Nobody opposed Kirkland 's plan . And you 're going along with it ? It 's been decided . Ken ! What 's that ... ? Let 's hope it 'll work . Ken ! Jun. Jinpei . Can we talk ? You see ... My mother 's dying . She probably has less than a month . She isn 't my real mother . She 's a woman I once rescued . But she ... She loves me like a son . So I want to spend this time with her . I 'm thinking of leaving . I 'm not like the rest of you . The only reason I fight is that I 'm a Receptor . Get away ! Be quiet ! Let go of me ! He 's a Receptor . Take him away . I had a reason to fight . I did in the beginning ... Are you alright ? - Don 't ! - Don 't ! Please ! Don 't kill us . Help ... Well ... I don 't know anymore . We 're the Receptors ... You 've rested enough . Are you kidding ? High-voltage ammo will keep a man in bed for a week . We 're not regular men . Right . We 're agents . Ken . Would you have shot me with real ammo ? Duty comes first . That 's the rule . Naomi didn 't think so . She put your life before the directive . Remember that . Let me talk to him . He 's dangerous . I got your message . Oh . Because my wife didn 't give anything away all of the Galactors will perish . We 'll follow our destiny . Then I 'll kill you . You may be protected in a safe house but ... I 'll find you and kill you with my own hands ! I don 't know about that . I got you riled up and lured you here . You make things easy for me . You 're after the Moscone ? You need my biometric ... And a control device to initialize it . I bet you keep it with you in case someone tries to steal it . Right ? - Ken , do you copy ? - Yes . Ilia has escaped . Secure him . Is Jinpei OK ? Ilia is your priority . Roger that . Jinpei ! Ken , why ? Why didn 't you save him ? Hold it . You villain . Good boy . In the 5th Century BC the X virus appeared on Earth from space . Those who contracted it were called " zombies . " Or " vampires . " Or " devils " depending on cultural perceptions . During the Second World War there was a scheme to use the X virus as a weapon . The war ended before it was deployed . The X virus research was believed to be lost . Half a century later a scientist in Prague found an underground lab . He contracted the X virus ... He became the first Berg Katze . Berg Katze ? We all contracted the X virus and evolved . That 's what Galactors are . Not everyone can contract it . The odds of becoming a Galactor are 1 to 8 million . Just like those who become Receptors . Yes , we 're the same . We can both evolve with the X virus . Shape shifting is tiring ... No ... Anything is possible with the X virus . Oh , God ... We can manipulate every cell . We can take any shape we want . Our matching rings . I 'm glad you kept yours . You 're not Naomi ... You still doubt me ? More people contracted the X virus and evolved into Galactors . By the time the first Berg Katze expired there were 300 of us . A man was chosen to take over . He became Berg Katze to lead us . Berg Katze the Second . He figured there were enough Galactors to eliminate all 7 billion humans in existence . Then the ISO started looking for Receptors . Unaware that they could become Galactors . That 's why I was taken by the Galactors . And I got to choose for the first time in my life . To be a G-Agent or a Galactor . And I chose ... freedom . - Why ... ? - It 's your turn , George . You can choose , too . Could you taste the X virus on my lips ? Happy birthday ! You 're infected . Naomi ... I no longer go by that name . My name is Berg Katze . Ilia isn 't Berg Katze the Third , it 's me . I was chosen as a symbol of freedom . You were carefree when you were a kid , George . I loved you because you were so free . Then you got the Stone . The Stone enslaved you to humans . You lost your freedom . I 'm not a slave . You are . You 're still an agent . Because you want revenge ? You want to avenge my death ? But , look , I 'm alive . Liberate yourself by evolving beyond humans . Forget revenge . You can be as free as you want . Just like me . Venus is in the shadow of the Moon . Look at this . When Galactors join their hands like this a portal to another world opens . All 3 kids are extremely responsive to the Stones . They are here . Your parents were killed by Galactors . I want to make them pay . Me too . I want to make them pay . How about you , George ? Me too ... I 'll give you a chance to get revenge . Dr. Nambu . I was expecting you . I think I heard something . It 's a woman 's voice . She sounded like ... That 's illogical . Yes , sir . I 'll give you the brief . Where am I ? Humans are pathetic . You keep retaliating over and over again . Your wife 's dead . You want revenge . So you build the Moscone . Blood for blood , it never ends ! But I can liberate you from that trap . How ? There 's one way to stop the repetition . Don 't use your master weapon on us but on yourself . Humans kill themselves with their own tool . That 's your suicide . Don 't act righteous after killing millions . Don 't apply human justice to us . We have Galactor 's justice . I figured it out . The Galactors wanted Kirkland to get to his Moscone . Ilia sought asylum so he could abduct Kirkland . Because Kirkland was implanted with the Moscone 's control device . The Galactors will attempt to control him to control the Moscone . It 's locked onto New York , Los Angeles , Rio de Janeiro , Sydney and ... Tokyo . The cannon goes off in 30 minutes . Find Kirkland in the enemy fortress and stop the Moscone . You 're authorized to fly the God Phoenix . Authorized ! How can we fly it when we haven 't tested it ? How can we fight with it ? Go now . You can test it later . But ... ! Roger that . Ready for takeoff . Let 's go . I 'll brief you once we 're airborne . Let me ask you this before we fly . How dare you desert Jinpei ? But he didn 't ... Stay out of this , Jinpei . I 'm asking Ken . Is Ilia more important to you than your crew ? I follow orders . Forget orders ! If I hadn 't got there in time Jinpei could have died . Stop it ! I underestimated Ilia . Don 't forget that we 're Receptors ... So we have to live the life of Receptors . That 's all you ever say ! You 're insane ! Insane ? Can 't you be normal ? You know we can 't live a normal life ! I can 't figure any of this out . I wanted a normal life . But I got the Stone and put on the ugly suit . And fight . I fight , kill and fight again . I even enjoy it now and then . I must be insane , too . You can stay here and rest . I can handle this . George . Ken . I hope you remember . A true leader protects his crew , not the directive . Here 's what you do . Go together and ... save humanity . Electromagnetic catapult systems all green . The war bird 's powered by the Stone . I heard that the donor was a Receptor . Then this plane is one of us . G-System booster running . The main engine idling steadily . God Phoenix , you 're clear to take off . Roger that . Open north gate . Attack commands received . Accepting attack request parameters . Lock on targets from one to five . Load G cartridge as well as propellant tanks . It 's too gloomy in here . - Why don 't we relax ... - Save it , Monkey . Shut up , Ape . 18 minutes to ignition . Once we 're inside , we split up and disable the cannon . The enemy fortress is 4.1km in diameter . Level 9 high density shield and multiple ESP guns detected . Activate Auto-Counterfire . Fire the Bird Missile at 80 % to penetrate the shield . Jinpei ! Ryu ! Let 's go ! George ! Jinpei ! Jinpei . Ken ! I 'm okay . Go ! T minus 10 minutes ! Find Kirkland . But , Ken ... Hurry ! Okay ! Damnnit ! I know it very well . I don 't need him telling me . I 'm a leader . My priority is to protect my crew ! I knew you 'd come . We haven 't finished yet . You 're too slow for me . You want me back alive or dead ? Wake up , Naomi ! T minus 7 minutes . This is it . Dr. Kirkland ... How am I supposed to hack this terminal ? What the ... ? I won 't go easy on you ! You could choose freedom , George . But you refused it . That 's right . I won 't be a Galactor . Very well . Go ahead , you can kill yourself . Can you see me , Galactor ? Ken ... How are you , Ken ? No ... Didn 't you tell him ? Some friend . I died for you . But I have freedom now . What 's going on ? Is that Naomi ? Stay out of this ! No , I won 't ! All safety locks off . Hi . I 'm Naomi . And this is ... George , right ? Nice to meet you . What 's that alarm ? The Moscone is igniting ! Jinpei , stop it ! Easy for you to say ! Oh , I know ! I 'll connect my terminal to the controls . Great ! How 's that ! Let there be light . Good , I saved New York ! And L.A. too ! Rio de Janeiro and Sydney are safe . I did it ! Guess what I did . I put the Moscone off its orbital path . It 's a tech ninja trick . Off the orbit ! Give it a better name ! Ryu . Here you go ! Now for Tokyo . Easy ! I 'm here ... I 'm here for revenge ! Jinpei , get back ! Nice suicide , Doctor . Status check ! We lost access privileges . We can 't control the Moscone . It 's still locked on Tokyo ! Stop it ! We 'll have to disable the satellite ! George ! You better evacuate . George ! Time to move out of the Moscone 's blast path . Are you dying to date me ? Oh , how boring . Let 's finish this . Ken , do you copy ? We can 't stop the beam from hitting Tokyo . Issue an evacuation order . It 's too late for that . - Ken ! - Abort . Ken ! We can 't leave George ! He 's going to crash this fortress into the Moscone ! We can 't afford to lose 5 of you ! Leave it to George and evacuate ! What will we do , Ken ? There 's no time left . You 3 go . I 'll join George ... No ! I know now . I 'll be with you until death . That is my reason to fight . Too bad you 'll never try my cooking ! You 're spared , Ken . Jinpei . Damn right ! Yeah ! No , Ken . Evacuate as ordered ... I won 't ... sacrifice a life in order to save 4 lives . I won 't sacrifice a life in order to save 10 million lives . This is our last mission . We 'll save George , ourselves and Tokyo . We 'll save them all . You 'll be liberated . George . I 've missed you so much . Now we 're reunited . How can I kill you ? Kill me . All Receptors must become Galactors . Kill me now ! You do the dangerous tasks while the others stay safe . There 's no reason for you to risk your life for humans . It 's your turn to become Berg Katze . Remember . This is true freedom . Did you know ? Receptors who contract the X virus become Galactors . Yes , but as long as the Stone glows , it protects us . And if it didn 't glow ... Then you 'd have to ... kill me . I 'd do the same for you . Stop that ! Ken . Tell me . Are you Naomi ? I am ... the Naomi you loved . George stole me from you . Will you kill me ? Will you kill me again ? Naomi . Ken . Join me in freedom . No . You 're wrong . You 're not Naomi . Naomi died long ago . You can 't bring a dead person back . Except in heaven . Ken , remember your oaths ! Orders and missions ... None of them is important . We fight to protect others . And we sacrifice ourselves . Just like when Naomi saved me . It 's my turn to save you . Ken . Goodbye . Naomi . Thank you . I 'm not done . I know . Let 's go . You go . George ? I 'll ... die here . You 're coming . I 've become a Galactor ! Not yet ! The Stone 's glowing ! Besides ... you 're my friend . I won 't desert you . Naomi died for us . So we 'll live for her . No , Ken ... Don 't be stupid . How can you ... ? You stupid idiot ! Yes , that 's right . You idiot . Let 's go . I 'm starting the engine . Error 133 , engine unable to ignite . We can 't escape ! Didn 't I suggest a test flight ? The Moscone 's going off in 90 seconds ! Any ideas ? Ready Bird Missile . We 'll launch with its blast . Impossible ! A 7 % chance of success . Higher than I figured . That 's the only way out . Ryu , manual override . Roger . Screen blast protected . Fire the missile at 40 % . Fire ! Damage on the hull . Shit ! 40 seconds to the blast ! We only have one missile left , Ken ! Ryu , fire that missile . 2.7 % chance of success . We 're together to the end . Right , Jun ? We 'll follow your decision , Ken . Yes , count me in . Me too . Let 's go , guys . Load Bird Missile . Adjust aim . Coordinate 1 - 2-0-0 . Fire at 60 % . 5 seconds to ignition ! 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... Fire ! Yes ! That 's Fire Bird , a tech ninja trick ! You did well . Hey , Jinpei . Ken told me that we 'd be together to the end . I heard ! Way to go , Ken ! I meant that we 'd all die together . I didn 't mean just Jun. Oh , you 're so unromantic ! Jun , why don 't you replace Ken as the leader ? If you gave the order he 'd have to go out with you . Ryu , great idea ! Yeah ! Oh , that 's so stupid ... You 're the best , guys . Yeah . Let 's go home . Roger !

Ó ² 1 Ó ² 2 Ó ² 3 you think showing me my dad 's memories Is gonna enlighten me ? don 't do this . you afraid she 'll see the real you , bennet ? - you brought a gun . - I was scared . that 's the first time you killed anyone .

It 's gonna be the greatest show we 've ever done . dad ? Dad ? I 'm here . there 's no signal . - claire ? You okay ? - yeah . You ? yeah , here , help me get these ropes off . Is that a lantern over there ? We 're buried . how far down do you think we are ? I don 't know , it felt like we dropped About 40 or 50 feet . hello ? Can anyone hear us ? can anybody hear us ? help ! Hello , can anybody hear us ? hello , anybody up there ? somebody help us ! Help ! Can anybody hear us ? hello ? Can you hear us out there ? how long has it been , really ? half a day , maybe . feels like we were in there for years . Is your buddy samuel here with you ? came alone this time ... So to speak . what do you want ? samuel asked me to come here and make sure Your friends downstairs aren 't a problem for us . I guess that means you too . Sorry to break up the lovefest . come on . You 're having doubts about this . Look at you . Come on , I can tell . You don 't really want to do this . what I want doesn 't matter . I don 't have another choice . don 't bother . We got you outnumbered . you want to leave , right now . are you trying to push a thought ? All but one of us are pretty ... Thoughtless . tonight will be a night unlike any other . Tonight ... We change everything . For too many years , we 've been shamed into believing We 're second-class citizens . When the truth is , we 're king of the hill ! they should aspire to be like us , Not the other way around . that 's right . and so I make this pledge to you . Tonight ... Once and for all , We pull back the curtain and reveal ourselves For who we truly are . After tonight , we will be respected . Think about what you 're doing . Aah ! Don 't do this ! Don 't ! matt ! Matt ? Are you okay ? no . here . Sit . - ow ! Aah ! - okay , okay , okay . It 's just dislocated . awesome . What the hell is he doing here ? Ah , there you are . Yes , it 's time for your solo . Ó ² How do you think all the people are gonna find us ? You 're gonna bring them here . I told you you had a unique gift . Now it 's time to put it to use . Ó ² 1 what dream ? thousands of people will die . He was right about you . you disappoint me , emma . you can 't force me to do anything . I would have preferred You were a willing participant . But these things happen . She 's all yours , mr . Doyle . I 've always had a thing for blondes . mm . - excuse me . Hiro nakamura ? - yes ? the woman in room 1106 asked me to give this to you . I trapped him ... in a nightmare . What the hell 's he doing out ? You did this . It 's a long story . but right now we need to know what samuel is planning When and where . thousands of people are in danger , matt . get in his head , matt . Tell us what you see . why , so you guys can run off and be superheroes together ? This is ridiculous . Peter , come on , he 's a monster . I can 't believe you actually trust him ! you want something done ? Samuel 's gonna show the world his powers ... New york city ... Central park , tonight . what does he mean , show his power ? samuel 's gonna open up the ground , Kill them all , bury them . that sounds like a plan I 'd come up with back in the day . you say that like it wasn 't yesterday . I 'm not that person anymore , matt . I know it 's hard to understand . we got what we needed . Let 's go . you 're not going anywhere . You leave with sylar , people are gonna end up dead . And that 'll be on you . I can 't let that happen . let 's go . I 'm not going anywhere . - what are you talking about ? - that would be me . See , I can still push a thought . I told you , peter , I 'm not letting him out of here . we 're too deep . no , we 're not . We can dig our way out . It might take a while , but- - we 'll run out of oxygen way before that . The more we dig , the faster we 'll run out of air ... Or more precisely , The faster I 'll run out of air . Your lungs will keep regenerating . what are you saying ? it 's futile . what do you mean " Futile " ? We have to find some way out of here . I think I know why samuel put you down here with me . So you could watch me die . lure them in . Oh , excuse me . my god . When I saw the nurse 's chart said " Hiro nakamura , " I couldn 't believe it . It 's been an awful long time , hiro , Ever since the burnt toast diner 65 years ago . charlie ? we have to focus . We have to think of something . - claire . - dad , you have a plan . I know you have a plan . What is it ? there is no plan . Now , I need to talk to you About what you saw up there in the house of mirrors . why ? because you 're gonna survive this . If it takes a month , you will get out of here . I 'm not going to . - that 's not true . - yes , it is . And there are things that I need to say to you . What you saw up there , all of it , it 's all true . But it 's not the whole truth . dad , you don 't have to do this . now , we are all products Of our own experiences , good and bad . Everything that 's happened to me has made me who I am , But it can 't explain what I 've become . you are my dad , for better or for worse ! don 't protect me , claire ! That 's my job . to protect me ? From the rest of the world ? yes , exactly . and that 's why you believe that people like me Can 't live out in the open . it doesn 't matter what I believe anymore , Because the whole world Is about to find out about you . We can thank samuel for that . maybe it won 't be so bad . Maybe the world is more ready than you think it is . Things change . sure . There might be curiosity for a while , But all it takes is one sylar , And then the pitchforks come out , And all hell breaks loose . I 've seen it . They will turn on you , claire . It 's human nature . You 're right . Things change . But people don 't . sylar killed your brother , peter . He killed nathan . I 've repented . oh , yeah , during the nightmare . Right , ' cause that lasted all of what , a couple hours ? not to us , matt . That was five years . Look , you heard what samuel 's planning . We can stop him . I don 't expect you to understand What happened in that nightmare . And I don 't expect you to forgive me . good , ' cause that 'll never happen . I 've done so much wrong to so many people . Just give me a chance to redeem myself . Matt ... I 've been inside of your head , so I have a pretty good idea Of what it takes to be a good person . Go inside mine . And you make the call . you see it ... Right here . no , what I saw was inside your twisted mind . That wasn 't your heart . I can prove it . Just give me a chance . you need to trust us , matt . fine . Just get- - get the hell out of my home . let 's go . now you are going to do exactly what I tell you to do . ? emma 's doing an incredible job . It 's quite a crowd . They 've all come out to see us . see us do what ? Our acts ? what else would I be referring to ? those news cameras ... You invite them too ? the world needs to meet us , edgar . It 's the biggest show we 've ever done . you seem nervous . You aren 't nervous , are you ? excited . Tonight changes everything ... For all of us . he was there waiting As I left the burnt toast that day . Some old man said he was a friend of samuel sullivan , Put his hand on my shoulder . Next thing I knew , I was on a street corner In milwaukee . It was january 26 , 1944 . oh , no . it was cold . I was scared . I didn 't know a soul , and I missed you . and you lived all this time . I got a job in a munitions factory . All the girls did back then . Did you realize it takes 108 pounds of rivets To hold the wing of a p-51 mustang in place ? Unless , of course , you use the 14-gauge Instead of the 16-gauge- - charlie , I 'm so sorry . This was all my fault . I led the evil butterfly man right to you . It is because I loved you that he sent you away . when I said that I was the product of my experiences , I left out the most important part ... You . You came into my life , And you changed everything . The man you saw up there in those memories Could never have died a happy man . But I can , because of you . no , no , no , no , don 't--don 't say that . Don 't say that . try to find a way to forgive me , claire . no . I don 't need to forgive you . I need to thank you . I am who I am because of you . I love you . I love you too , claire bear . So I want you to promise me something ... That you 'll hide . what ? the world doesn 't have to know about you . You--you can stay in . You can blend in . You can pass , claire . You know how to do it . dad , we don 't have to do this . We can find a way out . I want you to promise me you 'll stay hidden . Claire , please . It 's my dying wish , claire . Please , promise me . - no , no . Dad ? No . No ! Dad ! Dad , no ! No ! Tracy . I don 't know what to do . He 's dying . not if I can help it . Come on . - dad . - noah . - dad . - tracy . we have to get you through 30 feet of dirt . You ready ? - yeah . - come on . Come on . - come on . - come on . - come on . you 're gonna owe me one . he will as soon as we get out of here . I hope you can swim . noah . Noah ! - dad . You okay ? - yeah . Tracy saved us . I know . I called her . carnival 's gone ? they 're in new york , central park . I lined up a chopper . It 'll take us right into manhattan . It 'll be here any ... Second . where is she ? she said you owe her one . we 've got to go . don 't beat yourself up , hiro . I would have waited for you , But by the time you were born , I was middle-aged . I 'm just so happy I got to see you before ... you 're not well . the good news is That brain aneurysm never bothered me again After your weird doctor friend cured me . Unfortunately , Pretty much everything else is about to give out . I can fix this , charlie . fix this ? How do you mean ? I can fix everything . I 'm sorry . Will you excuse us for one minute ? he 's done it . He 's brought in thousands of people . this is gonna be a massacre . we got to find the backstage area . You know where it is ? yeah , it 's back that way . all right , let 's split up . You go that way , and I 'll head off this way . - okay . - claire ... Be careful . you too . this way . Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . The dream . - what ? all these people- - they 're all here , Like lambs to the slaughter . it 's not gonna happen , peter . Go find samuel . I 'll save them . Peter ... Your dream said I save her . Trust me . it 's an emergency . Tell hiro he needs to get here as fast as he can . where do you think you 're going ? don 't worry . I 've come to save you . What brings you to the big apple ? everybody . Everybody listen to me , please . Please , okay ? We need to get you as far away from samuel as possible . you don 't belong here , claire . look , I know what he told you about tonight , That you 're coming out And that you 're gonna be able to live out in the open . And trust me , there is nobody who wants that more than me . But this is not your coming-out party . This is his . well , look who finally came up for air . What are you doing here , claire ? You 're not part of this family . you 're right . I 'm not . But let me ask you something . Does your family know What you 're planning to do here tonight ? why don 't you tell them ? he 's gonna kill all of those people out there . That 's how he 's gonna introduce you to the world . why would he do that , claire ? He 's given us all new life . If he hadn 't found me , I 'd still be living out in that park . Homeless . they know the truth , claire . Tonight is our night . I never wanted to hurt your family , edgar . Ask yourself if that 's true of samuel . He killed his own brother . I 'm only here to stop him From murdering a lot of other people . then you and I have the same goal . I can 't just kill him in front of the others . And you strike me as the kind of man with a plan . So what do we do ? it 's simple . I 'll be waiting for you in 1944 . When you pop in on that snowy street corner , I 'll take you back to burnt toast diner , Right where I left you . and I 'd be young again . and we can finally build a life together . oh . That sounds nice . But , hiro , I already had a life . I had a wonderful life . 65 years is a long time . grandma ! hey , there , honeysuckle . Where 's mommy and daddy ? they 're talking to the nurse . oh . Sally ... This is an old friend of mine . His name is hiro . that 's a funny name . Hello , sally . hi . sally , go find mommy and daddy So they can meet hiro , okay ? - okay . hiro ... After the war , I married a wonderful man . We had four children . I now have seven beautiful grandchildren . We had a home , friends , Cherished memories ... A life . If I were to go back now and lead a different life , What would happen with all that ? What would happen to sally ? hiro . doyle , I don 't want to hurt you . Just let her go , please . since when do you ask politely ? a lot of people are gonna die if we don 't stop this . - are you a shape - shifter ? Is that dudley do-right in there ? you can 't hold us here forever . I don 't plan on it ... Just long enough for samuel to finish the show . Isn 't that right , em ? Oh , I don 't think she heard me . are you okay ? Sylar , please . Listen to me . Please , samuel made me do it . really ? 'cause I thought you were the puppet master . oh , come on . What do you care about this girl , anyway ? I am here to save her . that 's not you . You 're like me . no . I 'm a hero . you think you 're here to save them , claire , But they don 't need saving . They know what I 've done for them . do they know that you gain your strength from them ? You are the source of his power . Without you , he is nothing . That 's why joseph was keeping this family small For all those years , because he knew . He knew how powerful samuel could be , That he would lose control Just like he did when he buried that town . But you all walk away now , and he will be weak . He will be ordinary . He will be nothing . I think we 've all heard enough , am I right ? he 's using you , And that 's what joseph was trying to keep from happening . But why don 't you tell them what you did to stop him ? that 's enough ! he killed him . He killed his own brother ! you think they 're gonna believe you over me ? They 'd be lost without me . There 's not one person here who thinks I 'm capable Of murdering my own brother . there 's one , actually . make that two . lydia told me everything . well , she 's not here to confirm that now , is she ? Because he killed her . that 's a lie . Isn 't it ? tell the truth , samuel . You had me kill lydia . I did no such thing . you blamed it on me to justify what you 're going to do tonight . what , you 're gonna believe him , After all I 've done for you ? I know I can 't stay in this family After killing one of our own . But he has to be stopped . it 's up to all of you . Claire 's right . You walk away , and he 's powerless . It 's over , samuel . come on . Let 's get out of here . now wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Where are you going ? Don 't you see ? You 're victims ... All of you , Like joseph . Run as fast as you can . You 'll never get far enough ! Ladies and gentlemen , do you want a show ? Well , this is the greatest show on earth ! we 're too close to it . go ! We need to get as far away as possible ! Go , go , go . you seem to have found my power . it 's funny how that works , huh ? I 'm not gonna let you hurt anyone now . peter , you of all people should know They have to fear us ! That 's the only way they 'll respect us . All you 've ever wanted is respect . We both know what it 's like To live in the shadow of a brother . Joseph destroyed my potential , kept me down , Just like your brother . my brother didn 't let me down . He built me up . hiro , you need to teleport everyone out of here . huh ? All of you ? we need to try- - everyone . there--there are so many . They all have to be touching . you heard him , everybody join hands . I 'll stay ... Take care of samuel . one , two , three . so how does it feel to be ordinary ? where did they all go ? They can 't have all left . They 're here somewhere ! You can 't leave me . You cowards ! Where are you ? Come back here ! You 're nothing without me ! I got to say ... I never liked carnivals . yep . are you okay ? there was a man named doyle . He made me play . doyle . your friend ... Took care of him . what do you think ? I like it . is everyone safe ? yeah , hiro 's taking care of them . They 'll be fine . head down . who 's taking samuel ? Is it a new company ? an old one . Lauren called in some favors . what 's she telling them ? there was a gas main rupture . of course there was . - and all the other stuff - - the flying , the rumbling- - All just special effects put on by a very gifted showman . you still can 't see it , can you ? see what ? the future ... One where we all get to live out in the open . claire , you know how I feel about this . how long can we keep this under wraps ? excuse me . You were witnesses . What happened ? I have no comment . can you tell us what you saw here tonight ? what he said . miss , please , you have to have seen something . are you sure , miss ? You look like you want to say something . actually , I do have something to say . claire . you 're right . People don 't change . You want to know what really happened here tonight ? Keep the cameras on me . stay with her . Don 't lose her . claire . Claire . you getting this ? what is she doing ? breaking my heart . it 's amazing , peter . - what is ? - when I saved her . I didn 't have a thought for myself . I could have killed doyle , but I didn 't . It felt ... good . It felt right . what the hell does she think she 's doing ? She 's gonna change everything . that 's right . It 's a brave new world . Sync by YYeTS.net

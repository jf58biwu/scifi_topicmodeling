 COULSON : Previously on Marvel 's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D ... You were dead for days . - I wanted to die . - And we should have let you . We gave you a pleasant memory of a beautiful island . You spent no time at the Academy . I didn 't go to your S.H.I.E.L.D. Hogwarts , or whatever . And an 084 is ? An object of unknown origin . Kind of like you . Skye 's trying to ID the agent that dropped her off at the orphanage . We agreed to protect her from the truth . You have to decide why you 're here . If you can 't put aside your personal attachments , then you shouldn 't be here . CALLIE : I completely blew the question on von Neumann 's entropy , freaking thermodynamics . The test is over , Callie . Just let it go . Yeah , it 's easy for you to say . You probably aced it . What you need a little distraction . CALLIE : This 'll distract me just fine . SETH : Yeah , well , suit yourself . Whoo ! Come on , Callie . Live a little . WOMAN : ( GIGGLING ) What are you waiting for ? SETH : Callie , relax . WOMAN : Yes , we 've earned this . SETH : Come on , time to have some fun , Callie . WOMAN : Come on , take it off ! ( LAUGHING ) ( WATER HARDENING ) Guys , get out . They can 't bust us for coming in here . Get out , now ! ( PANTING ) SETH : Come on , get it off me ! ( YELLING ) CALLIE : Seth , pull ! Come on ! SETH : I 'm trying ! - My leg ! - Hey . Get it off , man ! SIMMONS : There is nothing more unsettling . Being a part of something so horrible . Completely unaware . The cadet could 've died . We drew up those concepts years ago . We didn 't know they 'd be applied in that way . SKYE : Is this the device they found in the frozen pool ? Correction , the instantly frozen indoor pool ? WARD : Seems like it was planted in the filter days before . Like someone was waiting for those specific cadets . Well , as far as they can tell , the device uses a crystalline nucleation process she designed . And a delivery mechanism he invented . That 's why we 're being asked to consult on the investigation . - So , we 're going to the Academy ? - Science and Technology Division . Cadets are pretty shaken up over what happened . Agent Weaver asked if you two could speak to the student body about " potentiality . " - Calm them down . - Of course . The talk . We 've all heard the talk . - I haven 't . - WARD : I guess you will . Well , I 've heard a lot about the Academy . I 'm excited to finally see it . Me too . Never been to Sci-Tech before . SKYE : Never ? Huh . The different S.H.I.E.L.D. Academies don 't interact ? WARD : Not much . Academy of Communications does . But they 're the biggest , and focused on data analysis . - Boring . - By far the easiest to get into . - That 's where you 'd be , Skye . - Thanks . WARD : Operations is the most aggressive program . More people wash out of Operations than the other Academies . So , which one is the hardest to get into ? I 'm picking up on the rivalry between Sciences and Operations . You and Coulson past all that , or are you going to help Ward steal their mascot ? We 're not going . After we drop you off , Coulson and I have other matters to attend to . Coulson hasn 't come out of his office in a while . - Do you think he 's all right ? - We saw him at a low . That 's not easy for anybody . Coulson 's tough as they come . He 'll be good . Just give him time . While he takes that time , it 's on us to figure out what 's going on at the Academy . SIMMONS : This was the SSR facility before S.H.I.E.L.D. was even founded . SSR stands for ... Strategic Scientific Reserve . Yeah , I know . Is this where you got all your PhD 's ? Oh , no , you need at least one to get through the door . Science and Technology what you imagined , Agent Ward ? Yep . No uniforms . No rope course . No defined muscularity on anyone . FITZ : No marching in place . No IQs in double digits . There they are . So good to see you . - You look as lovely as ever . - I concur . Thank you . Agent Ward , a pleasure to have you , sir . Agent Weaver . There 's a list of suspects ? Based on the level of intelligence it would take to put a device together like the one we found , we 've narrowed it down to the top 10 % of our cadets . I 'm worried there 's a bad seed . Ops and Sciences have differences , but both have to be careful about what we call " bad seeds . " People want to use the tools we give them ... " Bad seed " isn 't a S.H.I.E.L.D. term , Ward . Just a term . I know you 've already questioned the victim , but I have a few questions I 'd like to ask him myself . I 'll arrange for you to talk to Seth Dormer when he 's out of class . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'd like to get Agents Fitz and Simmons settled into the lecture hall . Come on . WOMAN : There he is . MAN : Wow . SKYE : Look at them . The popular kids . Who knew ? I did . Come on . While we have a minute , I think there 's something you 'll wanna see . SKYE : The Wall of Valor . WARD : So you 've read about it ? Every S.H.I.E.L.D. facility has a memorial to the agents lost in the line of duty . S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s history can be traced on walls like this . Huh . " Bucky " Barnes . WARD : Puts it in perspective , what we do . SKYE : Must make you guys proud . All this history . Just wish I was a part of it . It 's not self-pity , really . I 'm just saying , everyone here has earned this . They deserve it . I hacked my way in . Feels like I cheated . All you need to join is a dedication to the greater good . Coulson saw that in you the moment he met you . ( MAY SIGHING ) You have got to put that away . How can I ? You read it . And you haven 't stopped reading it . ( SIGHING ) I just can 't get my head around it . I remember what happened , the pain , but I also remember Tahiti . What 's in that file , it 's the truth . Says who ? Director Fury . If I hadn 't asked , he 'd have kept it from me , kept me from knowing . And now that you know , do you feel better ? Put it away . ( SIGHING ) You wanna tell me why we 're flying to Mexico City ? To get your head working on something else . I 've been looking into Skye 's past like you asked , into the agent who dropped her off at the orphanage . Agent Avery . She was killed . But her partner wasn 't . He disappeared . - COULSON : Richard Lumley . - Went off-grid 23 years ago . Day after Avery was crossed off . He 's resurfaced ? A few days ago , a Mexican teenager posted a selfie on his Facebook page and managed to capture our guy leaving a grocery store in the background . If he 's good enough to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D. all these years , he 'll know . And he 'll be on the move . We have a short window to intercept . He may have killed Agent Avery . Or wanted to avoid the same fate . We find him , we find out . How long till we touchdown ? Forty minutes . I 'll gas the car . Today , we 're proud to welcome back two of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy 's finest . Our youngest graduates to date . You know their names . Please join me in welcoming Agent Leopold Fitz and Agent Jemma Simmons . Thank you , Agent Weaver . It 's nice to be back . Unfortunately , it has to be under these circumstances . FITZ : If you don 't know the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. by now , there 's no excuse . Unless you fell asleep in Professor Vaughn 's class , - that 's a perfectly acceptable excuse . - ( ALL LAUGHING ) Our instinct , as scientists , is to move forward , advance quickly , push the envelope . But given recent events , it makes sense to reflect back on our history . WARD : You can 't think of any reason a top student would want to go after you ? No . The top students are my friends . It 's competitive here , but we usually don 't resort to knocking each other off . This isn 't Operations . No offense . None taken . All these names you would consider friendly ? Well ... Not Donnie Gill . I barely know the kid . He doesn 't talk to anyone . - And he was at the pool . - Studying . But I don 't think he 's the guy . He just has trouble communicating with anyone below a 170 IQ . S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after the SSR was able to defeat the nearly indomitable force known as HYDRA . We tend to forget that these organizations , HYDRA , Centipede , AIM , were also made up of extremely brilliant scientists . Men and women who started with the same unlimited potential as you or I. Potential can sometimes be dangerous . Plutonium has the potential to power a city , or to be a nuclear bomb . SIMMONS : Today we 'd like to share a few stories from the field in which we learned this lesson , up close . And faced the consequences when untested technology or biology lands in the wrong hands . And don 't worry , we brought pictures . ( ALL LAUGHING ) Oh , God . Oh , God . What is this ? What 's happening to me ? Help me ! Help me ! Get it off . Make it stop ! Help me ! Get it off ! No ! Make it stop ! ( PEOPLE CLAMORING ) ( WOMAN SCREAMING ) SIMMONS : Find exposed skin . He needs glucose to lower his body 's natural freezing point . Simmons , I need something to break the ice . Jemma . - Ready ? - Yeah . WARD : Fitz , talk to me . Something 's doing this to him . Find it . SKYE : Ward , there it is . Fitz , what now ? Smash the damned thing ! ( GROANING ) ( BREATHING HEAVILY ) FITZ : It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's okay . It 's over . ( ALL APPLAUDING ) I don 't want to hear excuses why it didn 't work . I have people who do that for me . I just want you to take care of it before I arrive . Just keep in mind how much this will benefit us both , yeah ? MAN : Mr. Quinn , plane 's waiting for you , sir . And you can 't think of anyone here who 'd want to hurt you ? I don 't know anyone . Donnie , I 'm going to have you escorted back to your room . You get some rest . Stay warm . Sorry I ruined your lecture . I was really looking forward to it . SIMMONS : It 's not your fault , Donnie . No genetic materials or prints found on the device . The components are rare and expensive . Freshman pranks are tradition , but these are something else . Attempted murder . So , Donnie was the intended target all along . Did he have anything in common with the cadets at the pool ? These kids were popular . Donnie was ... Not . Donnie hadn 't made any enemies here , but he hadn 't made any friends either . He had a hard time adjusting ? How old is he ? Eighteen . Youngest since you guys . 190 IQ and failing out of high school when we met him . Probably bored out of his mind . If things went well , we were considering graduating him early and assigning him to the Sandbox . Wow ! Well , he would love it there . He doesn 't like it here . So , I 'm afraid he 'll wash out . WARD : Maybe that was the idea . Agent Weaver , keep working with investigations . Interviewing cadets , instructors . Of course . - And us ? - Their interviews won 't bear fruit . We teach cadets to keep secrets . Where did you guys hang out when you wanted to get away from the faculty ? Can we tell someone from Operations ? Yes . Because we need to conduct our own investigation . COULSON : Dario Marquez 's dress shop . Marquez doesn 't do the best papers in town , but he also doesn 't use a computer . So , if Lumley 's going to make a run for it , your guess is he might pass through that door ? It 's worth a shot . So we wait . SIMMONS : And when we get there ? WARD : We mingle , low key . You and Skye get comfortable with the students , see if you can get them gossiping . Skye looks young enough to blend in . SKYE : You 're not exactly OI ' Man River , and Fitz looks younger than us . The time will come when you won 't make fun of me for that . You 'll be jealous . You 'll be jealous , wrinkly old hags . WARD : I want Fitz to go talk to Donnie . - Sorry ? - Donnie 's withdrawn . Might know more than he 's letting on . You 're a hero here , Fitz . He looks up to you . Go hang out with him . Even if he has no clue who might be after him , - he could use a friend . - That is a wonderful idea . Ward has them from time to time . I 'll meet you later . WARD : What ? - It 's strategic . - it 's adorable . The Tin Man has a heart after all . So , where are we going ? ( CLEARING THROAT ) ( CHUCKUNG ) SIMMONS : S.H.I.E.L.D. keeps careful watch of everything within their walls . So , in the late ' 60s , to escape the cameras and the prying eyes of the faculty , a few cadets started sneaking down to The Boiler Room . To play cards , exchange ideas ... SKYE : My kind of people . Some amazing breakthroughs have come out of here . So the tradition lives on . Of cramming into The Boiler Room ? - ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) - ( INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ) SIMMONS : Well , over the years , we 've made a few improvements . ( SKYE LAUGHING ) SIMMONS : Do you have one of these at Operations ? No . Did not think so . Drinks are on me . ( KNOCKING ON DOOR ) - Donnie . - Agent Fitz , sir . Oh , please , call me Fitz . - Mind if I come in ? - Yeah . I mean no , I don 't . Okay . My room was just like this , except ... there was a lot more laundry on the floor . ( CHUCKUNG ) You feeling better ? You know , you shouldn 't be afraid to tell me if you think someone could be targeting you . No. it was probably just a prank . Freshmen get pranked . I remember , vividly . But that doesn 't mean that every freshman needs to be thawed . Is that a design for organic light-emitting diodes ? - For active camouflage , I 'm thinking . - Huh . An ionized air cannon ? It 's so small . Well , I was able to double the pressurization by making ... By making it compact . Clever . I must say , these ideas are way beyond what I was toying with in my first few months . You shouldn 't keep these big ideas to yourself . You should run them by your instructors . These aren 't my big ideas . So , say you 're going to do what this guy did . Leave S.H.I.E.L.D. Go off the grid . What 's your move ? I 'd hide in the wheel well of a 747 flight from Newark to Singapore . Oxygen . A chute . The back half of the trip passes over 3,000 miles of land , a dozen countries . Could drop anywhere . You 'd probably head to South America . You speak Spanish . Vacation Spanish . Lima , most likely . - What with the growing food scene ... - All right . What 's up ? - You tell me . - You 're talking . - More than ever . - ' Cause you 're not . You suddenly became active on the Skye investigation ? She 's proved herself . Stepped up in a big way . For our team . For you . Is that it ? Or is it just to distract me ? ( SIGHING ) Both . I know you 're having a hard time believing what ... They changed my memories . Who 's to say they didn 't change more ? ( SIGHING ) I say . I know you , Phil . And I knew you before . You know I 'd be the first to go down that road if I thought it led somewhere . Do you believe me , at least ? - Do you ? - Yes . Good . But I 'm tired of secrets . So , I 'm glad we 're here . We need to root out all the secrets . Agent Ward and I have been having sex ... I got him . COULSON : He 's headed your way . Looks like he 's heading down the alley . ( GRUNTING ) ( GRUNTING ) ( TIRES SCREECHING ) ( MACHINERY WHIRRING ) I 'm Agent Coulson . With S.H.I.E.L.D. Oh , thank God . This is about the baby girl , isn 't it ? COULSON : Cyanide ? What did you think we were gonna do to you ? What they did to her . - COULSON : Agent Linda Avery ? - She wasn 't the first one to die . We were headed into the Hunan Province of China . A senior agent called in an 084 . An object of unknown origin . We 've dealt with those before . He said the entire village had died trying to protect this one . Avery and I were just fresh out of the Academy . There were five of us running the back-end . Until we lost communication with the first team . We went searching . Found the senior agent under a bridge . He managed to escape with a gunshot wound to the neck , but he bled out . He was still holding on to the 084 . ( SCOFFING ) Poor thing was covered in blood . We thought she was dead , too . But she was just asleep in the dead agent 's arms . The baby ? The girl was the 084 ? If she had powers or something , we never witnessed it . The five of us helicoptered the kid out . Headed home . After we landed , we started getting crossed off . - Executed ? - Tortured . Heads bashed in . When it came down to Avery and I , we realized the only way to keep our people and the kid from being hunted ... Was to erase her from existence . Avery was smart . She used the lead agent 's credentials to fake a Level 8 clearance . She 'd set up a nearly invisible protocol . The foster system was ordered to move the child around every few months . But they still got to Avery . She died protecting that secret . - And you left town . - Oh , I left everything . I mean , whoever killed that kid 's family , and all those agents , was a force to be reckoned with . - That girl ... - Don 't tell me a damn thing about her . I don 't wanna know . You understand ? Just tell me ... Is she okay ? She 's safe . Then maybe it was all worth it . You taking me in ? - Yeah . - No . I 'm not sure S.H.I.E.L.D. is the safest place for you right now . We 'll get in the air and drop you somewhere along the route . Thank you . Bit of advice . Stop digging . And stay the hell away from that girl . 'Cause wherever she goes , death follows . It 's best no one knows about this . For Skye 's safety and for ours . You can never tell her . ( DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) Bartender seemed chatty . He 's in Computer Sciences . Didn 't take long to convince him I was a Level 7 CS operative . And guess where I 'm stationed ? The Sandbox . Good thinking . I asked if any of the cadets had hopes on getting assigned there . Behind me . Curls . Callie Hannigan . Ambitious . Gunned hard for getting assigned to the Sandbox . And apparently , word 's gotten around she 's lost the top spot . - She was at the pool . - But didn 't wanna go in . FITZ : A battery that carries a terawatt of energy ? This is amazing . Would be . If it worked . I 'm close . I 've built some quarter scale . They work at that size , but the heat increases at a 4 : 1 ratio with scale . And it melts down . Why not use oxygen ? Breathe it in from the outside ? Sure , it 's not gonna react as well with the lithium ion , but the cooling effect would surely make up for that discrepancy . No ? Holy crap . - I mean , it 's just an idea . - That 's insane . But you should show it to Agent Weaver before you test it . You have no idea how powerful this thing could be . Of course . Wow . I 'm sorry , that was awesome . It 's true what the other guys say , you are the smartest person to come through here . Is that what they say ? Yeah . Well , Simmons is probably smarter , technically , but that 's because she likes homework more than life itself . Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time . Or to just plain talk to . You know ... I didn 't like it here at the Academy , at first . - You didn 't ? - No . I was shy . A bit of a loner . My mum did her best at home . But I might as well have been speaking Japanese when I talked electronics . So , I kept things to myself . Me too . Kids in my hometown wouldn 't talk to me . And when S.H.I.E.L.D. told my dad I was gifted , he said , " At what ? " ( CHUCKLING ) Yeah . Well , hang in there . You 'll find a friend here . Actually , I 'm off to meet the team right now at The Boiler Room , if you 'd like to join . Uh , maybe later . I 'm gonna try to draw up some of those changes . Later it is . And thanks . No problem . Not a bad shot . You mean for a girl . WARD : For anybody . Elastic collision equations , contact point geometry , and practice . Hmm . So , why 's a guy from Operations hanging out in The Boiler Room anyway ? Looking for the smartest mind you have here . To duck out , join my top Shadow Unit . - Is that you ? - Could be . Shadow Unit doing what ? I 've said too much already . But that tech in the lecture hall ... It was impressive . Whoever built that tech , I could see them moving to Level 6 within the year . Even though Donnie and Seth were hurt ? The boys survived . Yeah . Probably the best thing that 's happened to them all year . Why don 't you tell me what you meant by that , and I 'll not tell Agent Weaver how eager you were to jump rank over at Operations . I 'm just saying , they got to meet Agent Fitz . They 've been talking about it for weeks . Weeks ? We just came here . Talking about it to whom ? Each other . Jemma , please don 't tell me you 've left The Boiler Room already . Fitz , they staged the attacks . Well , that 's nonsense . Why ? To lure us to the Academy , and to take them off our radar as suspects . You need to get out of there , he 's after you ! Relax , I 'm out . You 're overreacting . He 's just a lonely kid . We had a nice little hang session . I actually helped him solve his power problem . Oh , no . That 's what you 're trying to power . A bigger version of the ice machine . You weren 't supposed to see this . This is very , very dangerous , okay ? You can 't have this here . We have to turn it in to Agent Weaver . You weren 't supposed to see this . We need to go . Come on . How could I have been so stupid ? Fitz , will you stop ? I 'm sorry , sir . It 's my fault . Any word on the missing cadets ? Ward 's coordinating the search effort with Agent Weaver . They 've set up a perimeter and are going building-to-building . Where 'd you guys go ? - We were trying to reach you . - Not now . - How dangerous are they ? - Extremely dangerous . This device turns any moisture around it to ice , very rapidly , at a great range . But Donnie 's a good kid . Just felt isolated . Seth must have befriended him to manipulate him , using him to finish the product . Product ? Oh ... Okay , I think they have a backer . The device , the components are incredibly rare and expensive . Nothing either of them could find on the open market themselves . If the parts are that rare , we can trace the purchases . Sometimes it 's not a bad seed . Just a bad influence . Let 's go . No , no . No , that 's not the issue . Look , Donnie and I have the device ready to sell . And we solved the power problem . But ... Look , we ran into some trouble . - S.H.I.E.L.D. ' s looking for us now . - Seth . What did I say was the most important aspect of this deal ? - That nobody know about it . - Right . Well , now the deal 's gonna have to change . SKYE : We were worried about bad influences , he 's the worst there is . Ian Quinn . You 've got to be kidding . FITZ : Thermopower radiation sensors . Shipped to Seth 's father , who 's a lawyer for Quinn Worldwide . Quinn 's buying their technology . SIMMONS : What a sleaze . The cadets have no idea he 's a criminal . To them , he 's just a venture capitalist . This is Quinn 's MO . He finds young talent , and he takes advantage . Right ? Hello ? Contact Ward and Agent Weaver . Have them widen their search to include Ian Quinn . Hey , can I talk to you for a second ? I have to brief May . Just two seconds . That 's all . Yeah . This is an unfortunate situation you 've gotten us into , Seth . Where are you ? We 're hiding at a parking garage , near the Academy . There 's checkpoints set up all around . We 're boxed in . It looks like I 'll be turning around . Sorry we couldn 't do business . No , wait , Mr. Quinn , please . Can you send a chopper or something to come and get us ? Look , believe me , it 's worth it . Prove it , Seth . - What do you mean ? - A demonstration . I want to see what I 'm paying for , in action . Right there at S.H.I.E.L.D. Then you 'll come and get us ? - I wouldn 't be able to resist . - Okay . ( SIGHING ) The deal 's a no-go . Let 's turn around , go back to the Seychelles . - PILOT : Copy that , sir . - Darling , can you freshen this up ? You ready for this , Donnie ? Hey , we 've come this far . Maybe it 's too far . ( SIGHING ) We 're in this together . You and me against the world , right ? How many times have we said we want a chance to do something incredible ? Well , this is it . And it comes with a ton of money . Come on , say something . I 'm nervous . The prototypes are harmless , burn out in minutes . But this ? We haven 't run virtual simulations . At this size , with the new power source , it 's not safe . Donnie , you need to grow a pair . You can 't bail on me now . We have one chance to impress Mr. Quinn . And now , he 's our only way out . We can 't turn back after what we did back there . What you did . You knocked Agent Fitz unconscious ! He found us out . And it was your idea to draw him here to fix your damn power source . Our plan has worked so far , Donnie . And so will this . ( ENERGY BUILDING ) What happened ? Is it a dud ? I don 't ... I don 't know . Ever since you got back from who-knows-where , you won 't even look at me . I know things have been heavy right now , but did I do something wrong ? No . I did . Ian Quinn 's not the only one who manipulates people , Skye . We do it all the time . Actually teach it at the Academy . - It 's our trade . - What are you talking about ? I 've been keeping something from you . But recently , I realized I had no right to do that . You lied to me . Agent May and I went down to Mexico City to talk to somebody . Somebody who knows where you came from . Tell me . When we started this , I warned you that you might not like what you learn . And I told you that it can 't be worse than what I 've imagined . It is . The agent who dropped you at St. Agnes was not your mother . But she was killed trying to protect you . Twenty-four years ago , an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team and a small village were massacred . ( VOICE FADING ) ( INAUDIBLE ) ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) ( THUNDER CRACKING ) ( CLATTERING ) I 'll be damned . We did it . It worked ! I did it . SETH : The ice stopped . So it 's ending ? DONNIE : No . It 's just beginning . We 're in the eye of the storm . Storm ? The crystalline nucleation should only create ice ... It did . Up there . SETH : We seeded the clouds . In the most effective way in history , Seth . We created a super storm . He said he wanted a demonstration . SETH : What are you doing ? DONNIE : I have to try to reverse the process . Look , Quinn specifically said he needed a working apparatus to come and pick us up . All the money in the world won 't matter if we 're dead . Please . Just please help me . COULSON : How do we stop it ? We can 't stop it . They 're in real trouble . Where is the device ? Most likely , right there . Dead center of the storm . FITZ : We 've got to get Donnie out of there . Ward , how are things on the ground ? We got almost everyone safe in The Boiler Room . Everybody , move back . Make some space . How bad is this going to get ? Bad . Can you reach the North Campus parking garage ? We think Donnie Gill and his device may be trapped in the center of the storm . That 's not far from where I am . I can get there . ( WIND ROARING ) Yeah , I can 't get there . Is there another way to get to Donnie ? Think fast , people . I know one way . Hold on tight . Seth , hold the barium hydroxide chamber in place . - Okay . - Hold on . Okay . That should do it . - Now take ... - ( SETH YELLING ) Seth ! Seth . We 're gonna have to try to get underground , ride it out till the storm passes . Hey , Seth ? Seth ? Hey , Seth ? Seth , can you hear me ? Seth ? DONNIE : He 's been hurt . Please , you need to help him . SIMMONS : He 's in cardiac arrest . Skye , get a blanket for his head . Lay him down here . Sir , I need a AED . Fitz , oxygen . 0.4 milliliters of epinephrine . FITZ : Got it . Get ready to clear . Charging . - COULSON : Get back . - ( DEVICE CHARGING ) And clear . SIMMONS : Pulse ? COULSON : Nothing . SIMMONS : Charging . Clear . - Pulse ? - No . Charging - He 's gone . No . Seth . Seth ! Seth ! Come on ! No ! No . No . FITZ : Donnie , I wanted to wish you good luck . - And I 'm very sorry . - Don 't say you 're sorry . My only friend is dead because of me . FITZ : I don 't know what else to say . Then don 't say anything . MAY : What will happen to him ? They 're moving him to the Sandbox . But not as a researcher . They want to keep an eye on him . Did you hear what I said in Mexico ? What specifically ? About Ward and me ... Yeah , I heard . I trust you know what you 're doing . If it 's a problem ... I 'll end it . Skye requested a moment alone on campus . - You told her , didn 't you ? - I had to . Must have destroyed her to hear all that . That 's the thing about Skye . What I told her shattered her world . Her lifelong search led to stories of murder , and now it 's too difficult to continue . Her search is over . Her story ends here . - But you know what she said ? - Tell me . She said , no . Her story started here . Her whole life , she thought she wasn 't wanted , that she didn 't belong . That every family that took her in didn 't want her to stay . Didn 't care . But all that time , it was S.H.I.E.L.D. protecting her , looking after her . That 's what she took away from the story . Not the family she 'll never have , but the one she 's always had . Here I am , telling her something that could destroy her faith in humanity . And somehow , she manages to repair a little piece of mine . The world is full of evil and lies and pain and death , and you can 't hide from it . You can only face it . The question is , " When you do , " how do you respond ? " Who do you become ? " ( GLASS HARDENING ) ( CELL PHONE RINGING ) Seth , I 've gotta say , you have exceeded my expectations . COULSON : We 're on to you . - Who is this ? - A gent Phil Coulson , with S.H.I.E.L.D. We 've never actually met , but I 'm familiar with your work . All Of it . So , this is a getting-to-know-you call ? No . Just a message . That the first time your aircraft drifts over any country allied with S.H.I.E.L.D. , we 'll shoot you out of the sky . So , this is a courtesy call . Well , thank you , Agent Coulson . And I have a message for you . The Clairvoyant told me to say , " Hello . "

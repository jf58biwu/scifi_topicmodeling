 I guess I never mentioned it . It 's a keepsake from my late husband . Huh ? I 'm sorry ... It was a long time ago . Don 't worry about it . your partner was pretty worried about you . Don 't wait until it 's too late . I speak from experience . How ... did he die ? Huh ? I 've been wondering about it for a while now . You 've always been there to lend an empathetic ear whenever I needed to vent about Briareos or my dad ... Compasses always point north . compasses always point in the same direction . What brought that on ? sorry . I 'm reminded of those words he said long ago and Briareos getting along . you really should patch things up with him . I still can 't believe that Deia was actually a terrorist ... Me neither . But friends and enemies can easily change places . That 's been an unchanging truth since our time in the ruins . I see . Some vacation this is . Later ! Poseidon has requested an urgent goodwill ambassador visit to Olympus . It 's our job to provide security . The ambassador will be arriving on an Olympus submarine . Security personnel from Poseidon will also be aboard . vintage submarine ? It was at the ambassador 's behest . There a secret motive behind it ? Must be a real big shot to get their way like this . You 'll take your Guges Ds there via transport craft and remain on alert in the air . Deunan will board the sub and provide personal security . Huh ? Me ? Poseidon specifically requested the hero of the recent " Bronze Bird Incident . You 're to meet up with them at the designated coordinates . That is all . Deunan . Sounds like your skills are in demand . Don 't worry about Briareos . We 'll look after him . My vacation 's on hold again ? Captain Diomedes . How does the prospect of shore life after 20 years feel ? I feel nothing special about it . I 've simply done my duty . six of them bodyguards ... That 's pretty light security for an ambassador . though . I 'm afraid I can 't let you in here . Why can 't I see the person I 'm supposed to bodyguard ? I 'm here on orders . I don 't have the authority . you know . it 's the whole gang . the chief of security . Could you let me through here ? We will handle the ambassador 's security . I 'm not just some useless errand girl . then . The ambassador is currently in a resting state . Vital signs show all-normal . The ambassador 's pod is designed to eject should anything happen to the submarine . the ambassador will survive unharmed ? That is correct . Are you satisfied now ? Then I ask you to please stay put in your quarters . my apologies . I 'm not trying to belittle your abilities . Poseidon has heard all about ES.W.A.T. ' s feats of greatness in Olympus . I must go and confirm our course with the captain now . Please take it easy in your quarters . The submarine carrying the ambassador is on course as scheduled . Our own ES.W.A.T. is assisting with security . We need it to arrive safely . Ma 'am ? it 's already too late . We can 't afford to leave ourselves vulnerable to Poseidon before the plan has reached completion . What 's that guy 's deal ? ! Sir ? ! No ... Something happen ? We don 't need your help ! Kagaya ! What 's going on ? ! Captain ! Captain ! No good . It won 't open . Why not ? ! It won 't accept commands . How 's the ambassador ? ! Still safe and resting . Safe ? Wasn 't the ambassador 's pod supposed to eject if anything happened ? That 's strange . The system is locked ! Chief ! Compartment E5 ! Thomas is ! Thomas ... - Was it an accident ? - I don 't know . we should assume someone 's taken control of the sub . Chief . Don 't tell me it 's ... Where 's the other security team member ? We 're being jammed ... Well ? too . Bow section is all clear . Good . Move to Section C4 . Understood . Dmitri ! Dmitri ! Dmitri ! - What 's wrong ? ! - We 've been cut off . Where is he ? ! The bow compartment . Glenn ! We have an enemy on board . We 've been unable to pick up its beacon signal as well . The submarine carrying the ambassador is not on its prescribed course . What is ES.W.A.T. ' s current position ? On standby at the very edge of Olympus ' maritime border . We 're ready to engage the enemy at any time . Dmitri ... Another murder . High-pressure steam . That 's how he was killed . Might 've been an accident . How can you say that ? except for the ambassador ! then . What are you doing ? The ambassador 's safety is top priority . Put your hands up . I 'm doing things my way now . Try to stop me and I 'll deem you an enemy . All right . I 'll help you . The only way to eject the ambassador 's pod is to take control of the sub and unlock the system . Could we surface and then escape ? We can 't navigate a sub on instruments alone and without training . What about a distress signal ? This far down ? We can 't transmit anything unless we 're at least at periscope depth . No good . It won 't respond . respond ! This is 109 ! It 's no use . We 're stuck on this sub . You 're sure there isn 't any other way to control it ? but ... Perhaps this would work ... RDX explosives ... This is the detonator . Why do you have something like that ? this sub was scheduled to be sunk at sea after delivering the ambassador . That 's what the explosives are for . using this to cause an emergency will let us take control ? Iris ! Diomedes ! Diomedes ? The only vital signs left are from me and the ambassador . then the main controls are the only way to pilot this sub . I see . then it can be taken down ! Open this door ! Or shall I kill us both ? Would you like some coffee ? I never imagined the main controls would stage a mutiny like this ... huh ... I don 't expect you to understand . To be one with the sea ... That was my purpose as a bioroid ... as this vessel 's captain . I don 't wish to live on land in a new body . I 'm beyond that now . The sea is deep and vast . It 's the one place where I can live as myself . I 'm going to live as one with the sea . but do that by your own damn self . What are you doing ? ! Causing an emergency . Jamming has stopped . I 've located the sub . Sir ! Request permission to leave Olympus territory and approach in extraterritorial waters . Granted . The ambassador 's pod ejection system is now unlocked ! What ? ! Our air supply ! I have to eject the ambassador 's pod right away ! Where am I ? Who 's there ? The sea is large ... Vast ... Beautiful ... I had to stay in a decompression tank for two whole days afterward ! It sucked ! huh ? did the ambassador make it out alive ? it sounds like it . The official press conference is scheduled for today . Huh ? ! Is that ? ! Welcome . Thank you for coming all this way . A fitting entrance for the start of our little show . Goodwill Ambassador Deia Cides from Poseidon entered the country to profess friendly relations between Olympus and Poseidon . Deia ...

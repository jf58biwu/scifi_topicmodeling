 we believe that this man was somehow connected to the blackout . ( janis ) he 's highly efficient in advanced computing equipment . he also seems to have a penchant for chess . the man you call d. gibbons- - his real name is dyson frost . hello , demetri . my name is dyson frost . got your attention , didn 't i ? in my flash-forward , i saw this symbol . i remember the images , but i just can 't put them together . ( nicole ) your have to find her , bryce . our entire investigation hinges on what 's in your head . i 'm here to make sure you don 't lose it before april 29TH . we went to utah . ( dEMETRI ) officer down ! d. gibbons knew we re coming . you unearthed the somalia photos . five minutes later , we 're getting shot at . whoever we 're investigating knows what we 're doin . we have a mole . you 're forgetting there 's another part to what we saw- - the part where we 're not together . hey , honey . i want to go away with you and with charlie . i just want to get away from all of this. yes or no ? thanks . hey , i 'm sorry . i was in surgery . oh , i 'm fine. i 'm fine . oh , god. what happened ? um , i ran into a bullet . babe , i 'm serious . 6 inches this way , this bullet 's in your heart . i know . i 'm not sure i can handle this anymore . ( SIGHS ) livy , i was an fbi agent when you married me . but it is different now . we have a daughter . i mean , if something happens to you , i ... i don 't wanna ... look , i get that this is who you are . but it--it 's different . i-i mean , i 've got to know that our family comes first . something 's gotta change . wedeck offered me a position on the dhs counterterrorism task force . it 's an improvement ? uh ... it 's surveillanc two guys in a car eating burritos , listening to phone calls in farsi . i 'll be out of the line of fire . my biggest concerns will be boredom and cholesterol . you 're gonna hate that . mm , but i can take it . what i can 't take is losing you and charlie . our family will always come first. i promise . so , um , if you need anything , i 'll be staying at the wedecks ' . i 'm sorry. i have no idea how to do this . neither do i . she 's been in there 20 minutes . i 'll call you tonight . are you my new partner ? if you are , i insist you change your clothes . can 't catch bad guys in pajamas . where are you going ? i 'm just going to the wedecks' for a little while . how long is a little while ? well , i ... hope it 's not very long at all . what 's this ? you lost your bracelet . it 'll keep you safe from the bad guys until you come back home . let me put it back on . ( WHISPERS ) come here . ( SNIFFLES ) i love you so much , charlie-bear . cAPTIONED BY closed captioning services , inc . if you 're watching this message in 2010 , that means the global blackout was successful . that also means we 've had a near miss in pigeon , utah . how do i know all this ? because i myself have had hundreds of flash-forwards . in nearly all of my futures , i end up dying on march 15TH- - like you , demetri . so if you managed to find this tape in somalia , it would seem our fates are on a collision course , and the possible outcomes of the game are rapidly narrowing . as for the endgame , the next move is mark benford 's . that 's dyson frost ? and it 's genuine ? yeah. it 's legit . degradation rate in the magnetic tape plus the date of production makes it authentic . the only explanation , however implausible , is that frost flashed-forward from 1991 to our present and saw us in somalia . then in 1991 , he makes a tape he knows we 'd find . that 's a 19-year flash-forward . and march 15TH--the day he dies in his future ... is the date i 'm supposed to be murdered . maybe that 's the collision course he 's talking about . dem , frost talks about narrowing outcomes- - another indication that what people see in their flash-forwards ... are only possibilities . could be warning us . warning us about what ? there 's gonna be another blackout . what ? how ? when ? we have to assume that 's agent benford 's next move- - to find out and to prevent it . so let 's make it a good one . find dyson frost ... yesterday . ( simon ) this is magnificent work . master circuits built from basic sketches i designed when i was 13 . well , when you finish patting yourself on the back , can we get to work ? i had to go to a lot of trouble to get all this , not to mention what i had to go through in that basement . yes , i know--the missing dig . a terrible loss . you find anything in those documents we got in somalia ? yeah , um , a couple of things . there were several references to tachyonic dark matter . in ' 91 ? how is that possible ? well , the theoretical basis existed . but the experiment failed . because they needed us . well , clearly , you 're missing the silver lining . the blackout- - we 're off the hook . not our fault . frost flash-forwarded in ' 91 using technology thate did not develop . simon , flosso said our n.l.p. experiments amplified the blackout . we can 't dodge that . find anything else interesting ? i saw this formula in my flash-forward ... written on a mirror . it 's the exact inverse of some of our early n.l.a.p. computations . i don 't know--maybe a process to reverse the blackout ? you 're working on blackout protection in your flash-forward ? i don 't know , but it was this formula , and there was ... ( WHOOSH ) there was more of it written on the mirror , and the two of them are combined somehow . well , we need the other formula that you saw on the benfords ' mirror . go see your girlfriend . ticktock . ( KNOCKS ON DOOR ) nothing . i ran face recognition software on every available database . since frost faked his death in 1990 , there is not one record--not one sighting of this guy. nothing . he 's a thorough guy- - likes complex things like chess . he 's also got an arrogant streak- - likes people to know when he 's winning . i 've been looking through membership lists of chess clubs pre - ' 90 . frost placed third in an amateur league in ' 87 . ( TYPES ) and the guy he beat lives in san francisco . ( TAPS KEY ) his name is ian mCkinnon . mCkinnon was the reigning champion until frost beat him in an upset . ( BEEPING ) so i traced him and then i gave him a call . but when i mentioned frost , he hung up . well , let 's travel . we need to get to san francisco and talk to him , right ? yeah. but first , there 's something else . ( TAPS KEY , BEEP ) this is frost 's fil tournament against mCkinnon . he uses a very risky play called the queen sacrifice . looks like a total hail mary , but it 's one of the most effective plays in the game . okay , so what ? he knew we would see these games . it 's another message from 1991 . ( TAPS KEY ) ( BEEPING ) tournament game sheets . each of his moves takes either two or four seconds- - never more , never less . in the three games , he made 50 moves , after which he resigned . so this is a code of some kind. wait. is this ... this is morse code . 2-second moves are dots . 4-second moves are dashes . there are 50 moves , so 50 characters . and this is just jumbles of letters here . not letters . numbers in morse code have five dots or dashes . 50 divided by 5 is 10- - 10 digits . is it a phone number ? prepaid cell . he really did know the future . ( frost ) well DONE . leave A MESSAGE . ( BEEP ) dyson frost ? this is agent benford . it 's your move . now we 're traveling . in english , please . i know you like halibut . some just came in this morning . no , thank you . i ate ... some cereal . oh , that 's not enough . you need protein . you are kind , but i can 't . it 's ... too much money . i want a ... new beginning . and new love . some miso soup , a little rice ? okay . okay . ( DOOR BELLS JINGLE ) not today . ( nicole ) come here often ? i 'm beginning to feel like a regular . don 't you have anything better to do than hang around a chemo ward ? bryce , you 're my friend . you 're crazy if you think i 'm gonna let you go through this alone . i appreciate what you 're doing , but i don 't want you to see me like this . is this about your pride ? a little bit , yeah . hello , it 's me . you 've glued pennies to the wall with my lunatic mother . i think we 've both seen behind the curtain . besides , the chemo 's gonna make you sick as a dog in 24 hours . so tonight let 's have some fun . okay , let 's do it . but i 'm buying dinner . ( MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY , SEAGULLS CALLING ) ( dEMETRI ) you call s.f.p.d. ? ( mark ) what do you think ? ( MAN ) right behind you . ( MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ) help you guys ? special agent benford . agent noh . detective john smi . yes , that 's my real name . what do you need ? what happened here ? eh , some guy from the chess club took two in the back of the head . don 't tell me--ian mCkinnon ? yeah , ian mCkinnon . person of interest ? not anymore . ian mCkinnon was unlucky enough to play a few games of chess back in the ' 80S , and now he 's dead . he was our best lead on frost , but our leak turned him into a homicide investigation . san francisco bureau is handling the follow-up , but i 'm not expecting much . how long between when you first made contact and time of death ? eight hours tops . there 's only one conclusion . the leak we 've been tracking- - that 's compromised the security of the whole mosaic investigation- - is inside the bureau . not just the bureau . no. inside our office . ( SIGHS ) i 've been ordered to give full agency support , fresh pair of eyes , all the rest of that crap . you got a play ? my dad knew a guy who used to go blast fishing . he 'd throw a stick of dynamite in the water and watch the fish float to the top . it was ugly , but it worked . game on . just don 't forget who your friends are . what 's unacceptable is that one of them is my enemy . ( MAN ) i need you to step away from your desk . what the hell is going on here ? everyone 's required to assemble in the conference room , sir . on whose authorization ? sorry , assistant director wedeck . orders . whose orders ? i 'm not at liberty to say . that 's not part of the task force agreement . ( CLEARS THROAT ) uh , no calls , and i 'll need your cell phone , please . don 't touch me , all right ? sir , your phone . what 's going on ? someone lose their keys ? simon campos ? yeah ? you 're in there also , sir . i 'm not really an employee . i 'm more of a visitor . what is this ? i 've not even had my coffee yet . what 's this about ? judging from the way our offices are being torn apart , i 'd say an interagency task force has been formed and is looking for a leak . we can 't just look for the leak on our own ? ( janis ) yeah . i think the point is , one of us is a mole . and mark ? apparently already vetted . this office has been swept . ¶ you are the sunshine of my life ¶ ¶ girl ¶ ¶ forever you 'lstay in my heart ¶ ¶ you are the apple ¶ tweezers . there 's your leak . get out . it 's voice-activated . when your office is swept for bugs at 4 : 00 a.m ... the sweepers don 't make any sound . no sound , no transmission . you 've vetted the sweepers ? since the blackout , all techs have been agency-contracted- - blind assignments . that 's how you do security . they just don 't know about the singing . so who has access to your office , mark ? everyone in that room . time to light the fuse . ladies and gentlemen , as you may have deduced , we 're closing in on a leak inside the fbi that is hampering the mosaic investigation . now anyone want to confess ? no ? then it 's the hard road . you 'll be first , agent noh , as you were part of the failed attempt to contact ian mCkinnon . you got anything to say about this ? we have to do this . vogel , you 're a son of a bitch . you know that ? true as that may be , i 'm working with agent benford today . i was with you the whole time in san francisco . i don 't think you 're the mole . who then ? someone in that room . if you don 't think i 'm the mole , what the hell am i doing in here ? i need the mole to think i suspect everyone , even you . w long are we gonna be stuck in here ? ( MAN ) good question . they 've got their whole procedure to go through- - re-vet contact histories , bureau records , computers . that could take days . they 're gonna want to vet all of our personal files . not if they don 't have passwords . you didn 't give up your passwords ? not to my personal files , no . something on your computer you don 't want people to see ? no , i mean , nothing that 's ... sensitive . you know , i 'm--i 'm clean . it 's porn. agent curdy , downloading naked cheerleaders on fbi time ? it--it 's nothing like that . it 's--it 's--it 's , um ... it 's just ... it 's an r.p.g. oh . what ? it 's--it 's an r.p.g. it 's a role-playing game . i play " warlocks of avalon " online . i 'm a seventh level druid . my name is " argothic . " you have any special powers ? um , cape of invisibility , lightning hammer , elixir of life , healing . that 's impressive . yeah , it 's cool . ( CHUCKLES ) you 're next. vreede . can i borrow that cape ? there any reason we can 't get back to work , do something useful ? vogel found a microtransmitter ... in that key . you want to be useful ? tell me who put that in my office . you think it was one of us ? that 's the working theory . hmm .

( mARCIE ) can you shut up for , like , five minutes ? want some sugar ? i don 't use sugar . mark ? we 're with you . you know that . thanks. but we 're close . we 'll get him . good thing the fate of the planet doesn 't rely on mark benford finding the mole . son of a bitch ! excuse me ! koreatown 's further west . no. i 'm not korean . i 'm japanese . either way , you gotta get on the bus . you want this car to do that ? that 's the idea . i look ? you look ? you look like you don 't belong here , and you definitely don 't belong under the car . hydraulics or nitrogen air bags ? hydraulics . could be fracture in cylinder . i can help . maybe i surprise you , yes ? okay , ninja girl . but if you break my axle , i 'm coming after you . mm-hmm . thank you . this is really screwing with my trust issues. you know that ? yeah , you 've been through a lot , janis . i took a bullet , mark . and i 'm seriously a suspect ? you have to admit that getting shot and living makes for a perfect cover . screw you , vogel . i 'm sure there 's a reason for this , but you got a number of unaccounted personal breaks in the weeks since the blackout--13 in all . so ? in the three previous years at the bureau , you 've taken precisely ... two . mark , you know what i saw in my flash-forward . i 've been going to a fertility clinic . yeah. you only had eight visits. we checked . so what ? so i went out to ... go buy some shoes . come on , mark . where were you ? hmm ? what is it , janis ? ever since the shooting , i 've been looking at everyone differently ... suspicious . just checking up . and you found something ? does he have to be here for this ? marcie has a brother . we know about him . there 's another one ... a half brother . he 's very sick . he 's dying in missouri in a full care facility . it 's expensive . marcie didn 't name him in any of her applications . those absences--i went offite to look into some things . you never mentioned this before . i was waiting . for what ? i was waiting to see if she did something . and marcie 's paying for this care ? there was a deposit made to an account for $ 50,000 three months ago- - anonymous . okay , janis. thanks . mark , i don 't know anything for sure . i 'm just trying to help . you 've done the right thing . it doesn 't feel like it . you trust her ? you know what , vogel ? being around you makes me not trust anyone anymore . ooh . ( charlie ) it 's gonna rain . yep , but we 're together . we 're having a girls ' day . i don 't want to have a girls ' day . i want daddy to be here . daddy wants to be here , too . then why isn 't he ? here 's the thing , sweetie . daddy and i love each other very much . but most of all , we love you . and we 're always gonna be a family . that 's never gonna change . i promise . come on . let 's go for a ride. yeah ? okay . let 's do it . can i ride the ferris wheel ? you want to go on the ferris wheel ? uh-huh . hey . so i went through marcie 's background . she did declare her brother in her initial application . but janis said she didn 't . the original vetting records were at a regional field office . when they were routed to d.c. , an entirely separate file was created . it was easy to miss , man . you okay ? yeah . no . no . i moved out of the house . yeah . olivia and me--we 're ... i don 't know . i-i moved out . sorry . is this about what you saw in your flash-forward ? mm-hmm . partly that , partly what she saw . is there anything i can do ? no . but marcie 's still a suspect , so keep digging . all right .
